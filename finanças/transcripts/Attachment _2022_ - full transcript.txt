Wake up. Won't you wake up? Listen. Please. Come on. Fuck. Fuck. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, I didn't see you. I... Sorry. I'm late for work, and I'm in a hurry. Sorry, I have no idea what you are saying, or what's going on here. Oh, sorry. I was just... I was just saying that I'm sorry, and I'm late for this work thing, and I don't know where it is, so I'm a bit... Oh! Does it have to do with that distressed-looking group of children? Yup, that's it. I'm... I'm sorry. Sorry again. TV's own Elf Princess Carla will be reading aloud in a moment. -Hello, everybody. I'm sorry I'm late. Are you ready to go on some Christmas adventures with the Elf Princess Carla? He pulled out his big Christmas bazooka and shot them all. "Ouch, my arm!" And then they all died. But they were tired and needed a break, so we'll have one, too. - Hi. - I was going to give you this. But now I see you're some big important celebrity, I'm afraid I'm just going to have to keep it. - Yeah. - You'll have to get your own. They don't sell them anymore. It's very old. Like, very old. Well, that only makes it all the more valuable. - Right? - Yeah. - There you go. - There you go. - Sorry about the mix-up. - No, no, I was the one... Please don't go. Sorry. Just... Sorry, I was... Yeah, I was just wondering, if maybe you... If you want to go for a drink, and then, you know, maybe you can have my autograph if you want. I don't understand. Surely, you can just give me your autograph here. We don't have to go for a drink for that, do we? Oh, right. Yeah, of course... No, it was just that, I think... I'm just taking the piss. - Sorry... Okay. - Yeah, okay. Yeah. - Like, right now? - Yeah. Well, it's actually 11:00 a.m. A bit early for a drink. Tea? - Yes, too early. Tea is fine. I love tea! So I know that I have some tea somewhere. I just... I... Oh, there it is. There's all these different fruits. - Great. - What would you like? - Uhh... - Strawberry? And I decided I wanted to do some field work abroad for my thesis. And I had never actually been to Denmark, which is really weird, 'cause my mum is Danish. So, I came here, did a bit of research, and I go home in a couple of days. That's why I'm here. Am I talking too much? - No. It's nice hearing you talk. No, it was like a Christmas TV show. So you don't really act anymore? No, not really, no. Only like that kind of stuff... Like the... Like elf stuff. So, what do you do for your rent? -Nothing, actually. It's my mum's place. - You live with your mum, too? - What? No. No, no, no. She's... She's dead. - Oh, my God. I'm sorry. - No, no, no. She got divorced. Then she got really sick. Then she died. And now it's my place. Which is... nice. Wait. You live with your mum? Oh. Umm... Yeah, back in London. Like, in separate flats, just in the same house. It's not weird. It doesn't sound weird at all, actually. It sounds really nice. So, what? Does that make me Queen of Christmas? No, you're like the Elf Princess. Too much responsibility for me. -It's your goodbye present. This is yours forever. - Take it, please. - No, I can't. Hey? Fuck! - What? What's happening? - Sorry. What? What happened? I think you might have been sleepwalking. Oh, no. Did I do something embarrassing? Like pee or eat something weird? No, no, you just stood there. - What's that smell? - Oh, I'm making you bacon. I can't eat that. No, no, it's fine. Sorry, I didn't realize you were religious. - I'm really sorry. - No, I'm not. It's fine. And I'm not. It's just that some things stick, you know. Because my dad was like super religious before he left my mom. Like... Haredi, you know. Ultra-Orthodox. Oh. Wow. Okay. But... So your mum isn't? - Uhh... Yeah, it's kind of a long story. Do you want me to make you some eggs instead? Right. Good. Wait. First, can you just bring a piece of that over here? - This? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Mmm. - Krolle? - That's curls. That just sounds like you coughed and it's gone wrong. -You know what? I think you're really jealous that I know Danish, and you don't know any Danish. Sure. And this is halskaede. - No. - That's it. It's a very beautiful necklace. Yeah, it's actually... My mum gave it to me when I was a kid. Yeah, it's an amulet. Jewish superstition thing. It's supposed to protect me from disease, apparently. - Great. - Yeah. I promised my mum I'd never take that one off. Speaking of... She wants to know when I get in tomorrow. I'll text her later. I hate early flights. - You have everything? - Yep. Good. All right... Okay. Just... - Bye. - Yeah, bye. Maja? I didn't go. I got down there, and I couldn't. I just didn't... I didn't wanna go, so... I didn't go. This is a good thing, right? This is a good thing? Me staying. Is it? Are we... ...happy about this? Oh, God. I'm just, yeah... That was crazy. I'm just gonna... "You could give me a look." "Walking around in the rain." ATTACHMENT "And the night has eyes." "'Cause you're beautiful now." "Yes, you're beautiful now." "Oh, for Heaven's sake." - "Open up your flower." - Eww. That's your favorite song? -In Danish it's very romantic. I'll find something else. Okay. You want to get that? - Hmm? - The phone. Oh, I'll get it later. Are you not so hungry? Okay, I'll make some more coffee. What? Hey... Leah? Leah! Leah? Leah? Wake up. Okay. I think I'm gonna have to rest a second. When is your flight tomorrow? 7:00 a.m. Apparently, one of those cool carts is going to take me to the gate. So, that's pretty cool. - I'm really, really sorry. - Hey, it was a seizure. I haven't had one since I was a kid. It's weird. It's been a really long time. It was either that or God telling me that I'm not allowed to stay anymore. I'm sure that's what my mum thinks. Hey, I'm just joking. It's gonna be fine. - I'll go with you. To London, I mean. I'll... I'll go with you. You don't want to come and be in my weird house with my weird mum. Yes, yes, I do. I do want that. Well, this is it. It's lovely. All right... Okay. Oh, Mum. - Poor thing. - Hi. Oh, my little darling. - I'm fine. - Nonsense. - Mum. - Come. Mum... Mum! That's... No, don't. That's actually making it harder. This is Maja. - Hey. Chana. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - My flat's upstairs. - All right. Mum's is this one downstairs. Yes, I was just up there cleaning up the mess you've left behind. Let's get you into bed. No, I don't need to get into bed, Mum. Of course you do. You have been travelling all day. And on Shabbos. And a cab, too. I'm literally on crutches, and we got out a mile away. Well, someone could still see you. - Who cares? Don't say God cares. - God cares. - The neighbors care. - I care. So you care that the neighbors care? I'm sorry, I didn't know that... - Oh, no one cares about you. - Mum! -That's not... You know what I meant. -You're a goy. You're not Jewish. So you can do what you want. - Exactly, whereas Leah here... - Don't start. Oh, my little baby. Tomorrow, I'm giving you one of my massages. Just like when you were little and got your funny episodes. - Great. - Now you need to relax. - No, I'm fine. - No, just lie down. - I don't need to. - Just lie down and relax. Just lie down. - Just stop! Don't yell at me! Yeah... You know what... You're right. I'm knackered. Why don't you just leave us for a bit? Yeah? And I'll rest. Okay? All right. Yes. Just don't nap too long or you won't be able to sleep tonight. I'll bring up dinner later. Careful with that one. Fuck. Sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot you speak Danish. It's impolite when Leah is around. Of course. I'm sorry about that. I'll replace it. That'll be hard. It's an antique. Hand-painted by Babylonian Jews. It protects against demons. Oh, God... Okay... Then I'll... - I'm joking. It's a copy. Ah, okay. -I made it. So it's not that valuable. Just irreplaceable. Well, I'll run down for the rest of the food. Yeah. -Be careful not to cut yourself. You're not wearing any shoes. Amen. It's really delicious. So, Leah tells me that you have lived here for almost 30 years. - Mum? - What? No, I'm just saying that that's a long time. I was just wondering if you ever miss Denmark. - No... - Mum, can it just... Can't it wait? We're eating. - But it'll just take... - Mum. Wait. Okay? Yes. So, Maja has been teaching me a bit of Danish. Using old pop songs. - Oh, really? - Yes, well, just like '80s hits. Yeah, actually, you probably know them from when you were a teenager. What's that one that always makes me laugh? "The fear is an ice flower..." - "Sjael I flammer." - Yes. "Soul In Flames." That's the one. Do you know that one? -No, no. I'm sorry. I don't think I do. How does it go? Oh, umm... Soul in flames... Fear is an ice flower in your mind Soul in flames Playing tricks on your mind... Inside is a little... No, I don't think I know that one, no. Oh, okay. Well, you know, I think I'm getting pretty good at it, actually. Okay, that's terrible. Lars H.U.G. - Sorry, I just really need to... - Okay. It's an old Jewish superstition. Can't leave a book open or a demon might read it and learn from it and use the knowledge for evil. Oh. Cool. Shavua Tov, love. Shavua Tov, Mum. Thank you for helping her get home. Oh, umm... I have this for you. It's an amethyst. It brings good luck. So you should keep it on at all times. Tak... I mean, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I think that went pretty well. So... Is your mum like... Is she, like... Is she okay with this? -She's gonna love you. Just give it some time. Okay. All right. I mean, she has met your girlfriends in the past, right? -Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she knew them. Yeah. Well, she knew of them. I'll do it. I don't know. She just... She seems really... Yeah, religious, I guess. -Oh. Yes, she is. I mean... Well... She wasn't born into a religious family. You know, she was actually born into a pretty relaxed Jewish family, but then she met my dad. And she came here, and she just couldn't fit in. You know, it's not the kind of community you can just join. And yet, my dad still insisted on staying here and trying to make it work. And then he just fucked off. And I think he kind of broke something in her. Even after he left, I think even after all this time, she still keeps trying to fit in. And there are some people who even humor her, like my uncle and some of his friends. You know, she'll go to their shops, and they'll chat Yiddish with her and make her feel kind of sort of welcome, but it's all kind of nonsense. But despite all of her whatever, she has always loved me. She has, you know. So... are you still okay with this, even now? Yes. - Is something wrong? - Mum, what the hell? No, no, no, I was just doing some exercises to help with the knee. Mum, you can't barge in like that. I came to give you your massage. Yeah, but you've got to knock. - Knock! - Mum, now is not a good time. Now, Maja, it's crucial that there be no disturbances or distractions. So maybe you should just go for a little walk. Yes, of course. - No, you can stay! - No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. - She's good. Lie down. - Yes, what do you want? - Yes... Hi. Sorry, I was just wondering if you have any books on... I'll call you back. Hi. I was just wondering if you have any books on, like... How to do, like... Just... Like Jewish stuff. No. Excuse me, if you don't mind me asking, that necklace, where did you get it? My friend's mum gave it to me. Yeah, I just moved here. She says it means good luck. -Yeah. Yes, yes. You can say that. It's an amethyst. Now, they ward off demons and the like. - Demons? Okay. - Yes, and the like. Well... Okay. So welcome. Welcome to the area. I'm afraid I have no such books you're asking for. My selection caters to a slightly more, let's say, advanced readership. Right. Of course, yeah. But, I mean, do feel free to visit anytime if there's anything else I can ever help you with. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Okay, let me see you out. - Okay. Bye. - Bye-bye. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, there you are. It's not good for Leah to be alone. Yes, yes, of course. -Here, love. Have some chicken soup. - How was your massage? - Yeah, really good, actually. Mom was right, it did help. I think I fell asleep at one point. - Yes, you did. - That soup smells really good. - Here, try some. - Sorry, the soup is for Leah. - Oh, sure. - Huh? Don't... Maja, just try some. -No, the soup is for you. You're the one who's sick. I'm not sick, Mum. I'm just injured. Either way. Okay, well, is there any more left over? No. You made a single bowl of soup? Well, I'm sorry I made you a nice soup. Perhaps Maja would prefer I make her a soup of her own. It's not like I have anything else to do with my life than make soup. - Why are you being so weird? - Weird? Oh, so, caring is weird? Will you just stop, okay? Well, if me caring is so weird, you know what? Let me take this soup away from you... What? ...so you won't be bothered by your weird mother. - Fine. - Fine. - Was that somehow my fault? - Oh. You bought wine. Charmer. I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I HOPE WE CAN GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. WITH THE SOUP You sure you don't want me to come? -No, Mum's gonna take me. It's just the doctor. This place really isn't set up for someone on crutches. Where is it? It didn't leave the house. Fucking wallet. Where is it? Oh, found it! Maja? Okay, see ya. -This is another amulet. It protects the children. See these words here? - Yeah. These are the Shemot. - Shemot. - The names of God. Wow. God has a lot of names. - Yes, many names. Have you heard of the Kabbalah? Yeah, sure. Like the Madonna thing, right? Okay. No, Kabbalah is Jewish mysticism. Kabbalists believe that the names of God can wield enormous power. Unlocking the secrets of the universe. Warding off evil. Come. Let me show you something. Here we are. - "Sitra Achra." - It means "The other side". It's what we use to describe certain supernatural beings. Like the Golem. You heard the story of the Golem? No. Golem is a giant monster made out of clay by the rabbi in Prague. He made it to protect the Jews in the city. And then he wrote one of the Shemot, one of God's names, onto its forehead, bringing the Golem to life. Here. Have a look. - Yeah? - Yes. That's the Dybbuk, it's the tortured soul of someone who died. Just like a ghost. -No, it's not like a ghost. It's a Dybbuk. It's not like a ghost at all. The Dybbuks possess the body of the living. The only way to expel them or to exorcise them is by finding out who they are and what they want. Like a ghost. No! It's not a ghost. It's a Dybbuk. - What about this one? That's the Witch of Endor. That's the first witch ever mentioned in the Bible. She's a very complicated figure. Some say she's good. Some say she's bad. You see, sorcery, black magic, it's all very forbidden by the Talmud. Whoever practices it is considered dangerous, sacrilegious. What's this? Speaking of black magic, that is a very dangerous ritual. It would also... ...have to wait for another day. Another day. - Yes. A goy tourist. - It's not too bad. - Poor thing. - It will be better. - Was it very painful? It was. And do you remember... - Maja! This is my Uncle Lev, my dad's brother. He's just decided to drop by. Isn't that nice? Maja is a friend visiting from Copenhagen. What a coincidence! You see, Ms. Maja has become a bit of a regular at my shop. You didn't say that. - I'll get it for you. I got it. - No, no. - I got it. I got it. - I insist. Please. Okay. Please, come sit down. You see, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I was a bit abrupt, and I'm sorry for that. See, what we were discussing used to be a very rich part of Jewish mysticism. But nowadays, it's frowned upon, and I can't be seen discussing these things in public. And then you also forgot this. Now, you should put it back where you found it, okay? So put it back. - Yes. - Thank you. Would you like a cup of tea or do you want to stay for dinner? I would love... - I'm sure Lev has plans. - Mum's here. I'm just gonna go lock myself... Gonna go to the bathroom. Hello. Yeah, so, it turns out that I've been to Lev's shop. Pure coincidence. That's nice. She doesn't know. But she should. It's too much for you alone. That's very kind of you to ask. But there's really nothing to worry about. It can't go on like this. Really, I have everything under control. It's for your own good. Yes, just the way I like it. Yes, Lev here was just saying that he has other places to be, so... Yes, I must get going. Okay. Oh, wait. I almost forgot. Some snacks... - Bambas... ...for my poor, injured niece. - Yeah, try them. They are good. - Yeah. They're like peanut butter puffs. Fuck! Why did you throw them on the floor? No, no, no. Sorry, sorry. I'm just super allergic. I can't... Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. -No, no, it's fine. Sorry. I'm just allergic. Yeah, but don't throw them on the floor. No, I'm sorry. I just... Yes, so, perhaps Lev should be on his way, before he kills someone. - Sorry. - I'll walk you out. I didn't know she was allergic. Chana? Are you okay? - I locked myself out. - You could just come up to us. - Leah's got a spare key, right? - Yes. - I'll wake her. - No, don't do that! I've had a few drinks. And that's not... It's best if you don't... Stay there. This is actually the first time I'm seeing your flat... - Thank you. - Hey... I was wondering if you would show me around the neighborhood. Leah is meeting with her advisor. It's not a good time. I have a lot to do. - And... ...you look like someone who could use a helping hand. The usual, please. Are you sure? It's fine. Just wrap it extra carefully, please. Thank you. Christmas is all I can think about! Father Christmas, maybe we're all... - What are you watching? - Nothing. Just doing lots of very boring reading, writing. Seriously, what are you watching? It's actually a very helpful documentary about wealth and resource distribution from the North Pole. Oh, no. Okay, I've actually watched, like, eight episodes by now, and you're so good in it. No, stop. You want to watch an episode with me? No. Well, you know, for what it's worth, I actually find seeing you on screen quite hot. - What's that? - What's what? You all right? - Yeah, it's great. It's great. It's great. Come here. Babe? - Sorry, sorry. - What's going on? -I heard something. I got distracted. Sorry. Sorry. What is that? - It's the fucking bed, Maja. It creaks sometimes. Sorry, I just... I... I thought someone was in here. - Thought someone was in here? Where would they be? Like, under the bed? -I don't know. Just a few nights ago I heard these, like, footsteps. What, you don't hear it? You probably just need some sleep or something. I'm gonna go pee. Speaking of sleep, could we maybe just... ...not light that candle tonight? What candle? Well, the... Okay. Okay, I don't know how to say this. I was just thinking it's really weird that we hardly know each other, you know, like... You weren't even supposed to be here. I guess... I just wanted to thank you. 'Cause... I have never been in anything like this before. Like, this serious. Like... And I feel like I might not be very good at it all the time. But you're still here. So... Thank you. And... You know, like, maybe when my leg's got better... ...we can think about going somewhere, like... ...the two of us. We'll try something new. Wake up. Please. Wake up. You have to wake up now. - Ms. Maja. - Oh, hi. Sorry, they've just left for the physiotherapist. -No, it's okay. It's a good thing. I came to see you. I thought you might need a little something to read. Can I come in? How are you getting along with my sister-in-law? Oh, uhh... Good, I think. - Mm-hmm? Yeah, great. She's just... Yeah, she's just great, you know. She's just wonderful. I mean, she can be a little... ...complicated to be around. Yeah, sometimes, maybe. Actually, I think she absolutely hates me. - No, come on. No. - Yes, I think she does. She certainly doesn't hate you for the reasons you might think she hates you. What do you mean? Well, I mean, I know some friendships are close. But very few friendships are so close in an apartment with only one bed. - No, no. It's not like that. - Listen, I don't care. Really, I mean, I could care, perhaps I should care, but I really don't care. And I can promise you, neither does Chana. You see, she is... She's a very troubled woman, and she's in a lot of pain. She is in more pain than you could ever imagine. I wish I could help her, but I can't. Neither can Leah, but... While it might not seem like that, I think perhaps you might be able to help her. - I don't think I get it. - Just wait, and you'll see. Just put it there. - I can bring it in for you. - I'll get it. No, just put them there. -It's no problem. I might as well bring them in... - Just do as I tell you. - I just want to help you... -I don't need your help. Give me that. No, but... Excuse me, but don't you have anything better to do? I don't understand what's wrong with you. Why are you so persistent? Because... Because I'm trying to make a good impression. Why? Because I love your daughter, you fucking tool! Because I'm madly in love with her, and I want to do everything I can to have a good life with her, and you're making it ridiculously hard for me. "Put the bags there. No, don't do that. You need to come home sooner. No, go for a walk." I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have called you a tool, or made fun of the way you talk, or made that... ...fart noise. Fuck! I'm sorry, Chana. I'm sorry, there's just... ...a lot going on. I just sat there in my dead mum's flat. I just stopped doing things. I didn't even pick up the phone when it rang. Everyone else had... ...gotten real fucking lives and real homes and real jobs and real children. And then suddenly, there was Leah. Someone to love. Someone to take care of. Someone to get up for in the morning. I don't know, now I just feel that if it's not about her, or when it's not for her, then I don't know what to do with myself. That's weird, isn't it? That you can feel like that. Yes, you should probably be careful about that. You end up becoming someone else. And you have to be careful about that. You become someone else, and that's dangerous. Why did you stay... here? For Leah. It's a good thing that she has you. But I do look forward to her leg getting better, so we can travel. Find a new, exciting place to live. Is that something Leah has... No, no, it's... It's just something we've talked about. We think it's really great that... I have to make dinner now. What's this? - A book Lev gave me. He shouldn't give you this. Oh, stop, it's just a sweet present... - And stay away from Lev! - Come on... No! Do as I tell you! Lev, stop. You will not go behind my back again. Stop talking to the girl. Stop giving her things. Stay out of it! No, I'm coming over with the book. No. Leah! Please wake up. Fuck. Maja, what the fuck is wrong with you? Magic and poisoned chicken soup and Kabbalah? I know how it sounds, okay, but I'm telling you, she's coming in here at night, and she's lighting candles... - No one is coming in here. Listen. Just look. Just look at this. - What... What is that? It's a drawing of your apartment. This is your furniture, and she, like, arranges it in a pattern. Maja, why are you showing me this? I don't care. I'm just saying that she's, like, sick. She's just... She's like mentally ill. I know! Don't you think I fucking know that? Why do you think I'm still here? This is what I've been trying to tell you. She's not well, and she needs me. Okay. I understand that she needs you... You know... Maybe this was a mistake. I think maybe we got ahead of ourselves. You need to just go and clear your head. You're not wearing your amulet. Maybe she's right. Perhaps it was a mistake. Perhaps you should just go home. For your own sake. I'm not afraid of you. You know that's not true. Fuck! -You have to... You have to help me! No. Listen, I can't talk to you. Chana told me to stay away... -You don't understand. She's going to kill her. Okay? And Leah doesn't believe me, but I saw it. Don't talk to Leah about it. Just forget everything I ever said. Forget everything I ever told you. Get away from her as fast as you can. Now, you listen to me. She is very, very dangerous. Hello. So happy to see you. Come in. Thank you. Let me take that. I'll get it ready. - No, I can... - Mum. Shabbat shalom. - Come in. - Gut Shabbos, love. - This looks lovely. - It's all Maja. L'chaim. To fresh starts. - L'chaim. - L'chaim. - Mum, the chicken's really good. - Thank you, love. Very good. So, you know how I was getting all upset about my supervisor the other day? Yes. He actually sent me an email today. And it was a lot better than I thought. You know I had that really bad... - That's good. - ...meeting with him. Yeah, but... He said that the edits that I just sent through on my chapters were pretty good. So... He also said that... Maja, are you okay? What's wrong with her? Maja? Maja! Mum, Mum, help her. - EpiPen. EpiPen. She's having an allergic reaction. Bathroom! Bathroom mirror! Behind the bathroom mirror! Just hang on, hang on. Maja, hold on, just hold on. Quick. Give it to her now. Hold on. Maja? What the fuck just happened? - The food. - What? Are those peanuts? Did you just put peanuts in her chicken? What? Mum, you could have killed her. Why would I... - I need you to go now. - But I... You're insane. You have no idea. Mum? Without me, you're going to die. Both of you. He will kill you. Mum, you need to go now. He will kill my little girl. What are you talking about? And it's all your fault! I said go! - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. I lost my temper. I apologize, Maja. I'm so sorry. I don't know how the peanuts got in the food. Really, I... I'm sure it was... ...some kind of accident. Don't you... Maybe we should all just get some rest, and we'll talk in the morning. And a fresh start. Right? Love? Right? Yes. Let's all... ...clear our heads, and... You were right. She's lost it. - No, I'm sure she's just... She tried to fucking kill you. Yeah, well... What are we going to do? I guess she needs help. But... I also think that it is not safe to stay here right now. We can't just leave her here. Maybe your uncle can look after her? I'm just gonna go get some water. So... Where should we go? Please... Please wake up. Won't you please wake up? Yeah, my dad never really uses this place. It's nice. It's quiet. Yeah. We don't have to stay for long. - Yeah, we'll figure it out. Yeah. We'll figure it out. Then we can move on... ...once your leg is better. Hey. What are you doing? All right. Well... I thought that I would try to make osso buco tonight. You have to eat something, right? I ate. How's your leg? Wonderful. Wonderful. Hi. Shit! Okay, we have to go to the doctor, please. Why? My leg's fine. I know it's fine, but I mean, just... Look at yourself. - Do I not look beautiful? -Yeah. Yes, you do. You always do, I'm just... I'm really worried about this. You look... Okay, I... I have to go meet someone. Just... Just stay, okay? Just stay here. Stay. - Hi. - Thank you for coming. Thank you. I can't believe you came all the way. Thank you. -Of course, but listen. I just don't understand. So, you live here in the forest? No, no, no. We have... We have, like, a house. It's my dad's house, a summer house. Up here. Yeah. - So why don't we meet there? I mean, this is a very strange place to meet. Yeah. She doesn't know that you're here. - Mm-hmm. - And also I... I really want to talk to you first. Okay, so you told me that she's... She's sick. I don't know. Something is just... ...wrong. I've tried everything. I've tried to take her to a doctor. I've tried to get her help. But it's like... It's like she's... I don't know. Just... not there. Maybe we should just go see her. Where is she? I told you to wait! You promised me you wouldn't tell her. - Where is my daughter? - Stop! Stop! Stay away. Okay, I saw what you did to her. I'm so sorry, Ms. Maja, but... There's something you need to know. Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh, I'm sorry. I was just wondering if you had seen my cat. I haven't seen him since yesterday morning. I have had a picture made. His name is Findus. He's just one year old, so he's my little "baby". How far along are you? Well... I should get going. I saw your cat. She was seven when she started having those tremors. We thought it was epilepsy, but the episodes got ever more violent. And she looked different. She would get very angry. And then one day... ...she had a friend over. A little girl who lived down the road. I could hear them playing. Suddenly, it went strangely quiet. They said it was an accident. A game gone wrong. It was no accident. And it wasn't my Leah who did it. Please wake up! - Who was it then? - A Dybbuk. A Dybbuk. It's a dead soul in a living host. And this one, this particularly cruel and evil one, has possessed Leah for many years. That thing from the book? That's what you think is wrong with her? I mean, we tried to exorcise him when she was just a child. But he wouldn't tell us who he was or what he wanted. And have you ever... I don't know, have you ever, like, mentioned this to Leah? -No, which was a mistake. I warned you. We can't keep it a secret. We should have told her. We should have told her friends, too, you know, before they did something reckless like run off to some remote forest. Okay, once again, we don't live in the forest. Okay? We have a house. - Yes. But with her and you so far away, it's hard for us to protect her. I think it's very important that we get to see her now, please. If it's too late, then we might have to try to... No. No, we're not doing that. It might be too late, and there's enough of us here to perform this... - No. We're not... - Okay. I'll take you to her. Good. Yeah? Where is your car? I don't even remember. It's a very impractical place for us to meet, this... All these trees. - You know what? Let me get my bike. I'll walk you to the car. And then you can follow me up the road. - Yes. - I'll take you to the house. Some parking lot in that direction. - Okay? Just go ahead. - Tak. Leah? Listen, we... We really need to go, okay? - Why? I like it here. Can you stop that, please? You're not okay. It's very hurtful when you say that. It makes me upset. Something is really wrong. Maybe it's because you won't let me see my mum. I miss my mum. - I'm sorry, okay? But listen, we really... We have to get out of here. You just tore my life to shreds, pretending you love me. You're so sad. You're just... aimless. Your whole life is... ...broken. Isn't it? It's too late to fix it now. - You're too old. - Stop it. Better to break someone else's. Hey, hey, hey. Maja? Help! Maja? Where are you? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS CAT? Love you forever... Ms. Maja? Take it easy. Slide over here. Don't worry. It can't move. Are you all right? I'm so sorry that you had to see this. What happened to her? She left home for too long. Away from everyone and everything that kept her safe. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know that I... I only did it because I love her. I know. I know. She was so happy. When we had found a way to keep him at bay... ...and she had become herself again, she was just so... ...happy. She had no memory of what had happened. She was just Leah. I had my Leah back. If she had known... If she had known that that thing was inside her... ...just waiting to get out, I would have never seen her happy again. We have to start now. This is our last resort. We hope it won't have to come to this. But we have to prepare... ...a Soul Devourer. It's this... this black magic ritual. We haven't really tried it before, so... Yeah, we'll start by creating this holy ring, and we'll use this bowl to seal the ring. Thus trapping the soul within the circle. Now Leah is fully under the Dybbuk's control. So that if the Dybbuk is in the circle, well, then that's who the Devourer... ...will...devour. However, the ritual cannot be interrupted once begun. That's what it says. Once my friends begin chanting the Shemot, the names of God, the Devourer will come for a soul. If one is not offered in the circle, it will look for souls elsewhere, and... We all die. Yes. That's why we'll first try and talk to it. You know, the negotiation with the Dybbuk... ...to finally find out who he is and what he wants. It may not work. It has not really in the past, so... But we must try one last time. Wake it up. I see. Very exciting. You're all here. That's nice. - Hold out your arm. - Quiet. I'm thinking. Chana. Mummy. My favorite. - Hold out your arm. - I said, quiet! You'd think being trapped for 20 years would be dull. Not with you. I got to watch you ruin your life. If you knew how many of those little routines and rituals were a complete and utter waste of time... ...you'd want to die. And, Maja... You and I... We were gonna have such fun. Oh, well. Here you go. Tell me who you are and what you want. This again? Tell me who you are and what you want. I suppose I've forgotten. You travel through so many bodies, you start to lose track. Sorry to disappoint. Tell me who you are and what you want! Are you not listening? Tell me who you are and what you want! Really? You want to know? You want to know what I want? Begin the ritual! Now... If I leave Leah in here, then she is the one stuck in the circle. She'll die. Or... ...you stop the ritual, in which case, you all die. Either way... ...I get what I want. So, well done. I couldn't have done it by myself. So long. Mum? Maja? What's going on? Maja, what... No! Don't move! Don't move. Just stay there. -What's going on? Why can't I move? Mummy, you're scaring me. What's happening? No. Stop it. Stop it! Hey! Mum? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be all right. - Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum? - All right, we're ready to go. - Sorry. Let me get that. No, it's fine. Just... Just leave it. I didn't bring any of her stuff. Just like you asked me to, but I... I actually... I found... Why? Because it's funny. - So... - Yeah, I'm being avoidant. Trying to. You're not helping. So, let's just laugh at my hilarious joke and get going. I... I found this. She'd be so annoyed if... She must have been so upset when she found it. Ugh! I hate that I treated her like such a nuisance. - You know, I really think... - Are we safe? Yeah. Hey... I promise. Okay? I saw it leave you. - It's gonna be okay. - Mm-hmm. Are you sure you don't want to go back inside? Just one last time? Okay. - I'm sure. Let's just go. - All right. I'll drop off the keys. Oh, and also, I'm confiscating this. It's not a toy. ATTACHMENT
