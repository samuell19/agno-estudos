Man: Send your contribution to Keep The Torch Lit. ♪ ♪ Newsman: The Statue of Liberty is undergoing a complete restoration that could be ready by July 4th, her 100th birthday celebration. Tony Soraci: That statue took a beating. All those years, see the little rust here and here? You can see the damage on it. It was leaking, the glass was shot. It was just a mess. If you were in the middle of salt water for a hundred years, you'd need some work, too, you know what I'm saying? And they wanted to take the old torch off and put a new torch on. That's what we did. Well, they needed somebody who wasn't afraid of heights, and I'd been in the construction business all my life. That was a lot of climbing. A long climb, especially in the morning. Around 5:30 in the morning, six o'clock when you're half asleep, you didn't get your cup of coffee. You're looking up saying, "Oh God." You really couldn't wear a harness. I was just sitting on the edge, looking down at the people there. I said, "Look how small those people look down there. It's like little ants." ♪ ♪ Newsman: There are two teams working on the restoration: the American craftsmen and the French artisans. The French responsibility is rebuilding the torch and flame. We are amazed of... of what they have done one century ago. I was 31 years old back then. We came to New York foolishly, like a platoon of Marines. Ten passionate metalworkers, six days a week, working like monks. The original Bartholdi flame was solid. It was hollow, but solid. In 1918, it has been changed by cutting into it to create a lantern. But all of that leaked extraordinarily. ♪ ♪ These are the... drawings of what was left of the original flame shapes. So, we had to do an exact replica using the same techniques, the same volume, the same shapes, same details. The other side of the shop was occupied by the American workers. They were cordial, but at the same time, a little bit sour, you know? Not to have been awarded the job. Ronald Reagan: My fellow Americans, the ironworkers from New York and New Jersey were at first puzzled and a bit put off to see foreign workers arrive. Jean Wiart, the leader of the French workers said his countrymen understood. After all, he asked, how would Frenchmen feel if Americans showed up to help restore the Eiffel Tower? Soraci: Our local was the first local to get jurisdiction of one of the biggest projects in history, right? And Carmine Sedita is the one who ran the local. Big old Sicilian man. Tall guy, goatee. He'd just look down at you, he'd scare you. You know, you listened to him. Everybody says, if it wasn't for those Mafia guys, she wouldn't be renovated. (Laughs) Before I went up there, he told me keep a low profile. You know, keep everything quiet. Keep a nice, low profile. Well, I tried. It didn't work out too well. I didn't know that picture was gonna happen. Reagan: Many of us have seen the picture of another worker here, Tony Soraci, the grandson of immigrant Italians said, it was something he was proud to do. "Something to tell my grandchildren." Soraci: I got a pullout page in National Geographics, look out. You had a couple photographers up there. So I leaned over, gave the Statue of Liberty a kiss, he snapped a picture. Next thing I know, it was in National Geographics Today, the president's thanking me on national TV. I was like, whoa, my God, how'd this happen? Whoa, am I in trouble. (Laughs) Reagan: As they came to know each other, the Americans were reminded that Miss Liberty, like the many millions she's welcomed to these shores, is of foreign birth. Soraci: My ancestors when they first came in, they seen the Statue of Liberty. And there's no way in a million years they could have had an idea that their great grandson would be working on it, you know? I'm sure they're up there looking down at me now, saying, "Good job. Good job. You did good." - (Fireworks whistling) - Reagan: That's my gal.

Well, good afternoon. Happy birthday. Glad to be part of the party today. The statue that I built for the New York, New York, hotel is a little over a hundred feet tall, so it's two-thirds the size of the statue in New York City. And to me, it's more than just a facade in front of a hotel. To me, it really took on a personality throughout the process. My mother-in-law passed away during the completion of the statue, and so the plaque dedicates the entire statue to her and that's what I said on there. - That this one's for you, Mom. - Man: Thank you. (Audience applauds) I'm Amanda Liberty. I'm sorry, it makes me choke up. I'm just so happy to be here. Woman: You actually changed your name, right? Amanda: I did! I changed my name to Liberty.

This ferry is the Miss Liberty. She probably has carried more passengers than any other ferry in the world. My dad was her first captain. He had me steering the boat when I was tall enough to stand on a chair and see out the window. Clancy (over PA): Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard Miss Liberty. I made the recordings, oh, about 20 years ago, and it's still my voice today. My grandfather was superintendent of the park. I remember spending a lot of time at my grandparents' house on Liberty Island. I used to ride my bike around at night, climb the statue at night. I even once changed the light bulb in the original torch. The largest light bulb I had ever seen. (Over PA): All disembarking passengers, would you move to the exit gangway at the forward end...

Yeah, birthday party. Woman: Both of our birthdays 9/11, yeah. So, we could share birthdays. Look, I'm pushing you! I'm pushing you away. And I used to tell people to get off my island. Yeah, she would do that. I'd say Marcy, you can't say that. Jay: I don't even think we had a key to the front door at the statue. Dawn: We'd go walk in there, and, you know, just hang out. And there's Charlie, the bomb-sniffing dog! - We used to hide gunpowder for her to find. - That's right. Jay: She was a golden retriever and explosives detection dog. The statue got struck by lightning a lot. (Thunder cracks) Yes, it does tend-- and it's pretty loud. (Thunder rumbling) You know, that was kinda funny.

David Luchsinger: My wife and I used to live here post-9/11, so, um... it was quite a different experience than the folks that lived here years ago in a community. For us, it was all about security. It was all about safety, and it was because of post-9/11. When I first got here, 86 % of people coming to the Statue of Liberty just got to walk around outside.
