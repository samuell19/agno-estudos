Agnes, friend of the family. Olive. Feel like a fish out of water in here. Oh, you'll do just fine. It's nice to meet you. Try not to make a mess, dear. - Okay? - Yeah. You didn't tell me, you were expecting a guest. Poor girl. Must've frightened her half to death. Why were you over there in the first place? Plants don't water themselves, Harvey. Just exactly what are you up to? You're the only real friend I got left in this world. Which is why this is so difficult. You know, whenever I go swimming, I have deja vu. - Swimming? How so? - Yeah. If I touch water, it's like I'm there again where I was before. I'm sorry. Hey, Crystal, free yourself from that electronic leash. Fuck off, Uriah. Hey, sweetie. Hey, Mom. Uh, you're not gonna believe it, but I took your advice and high-tailed it out of the city for the weekend. Oh, that's wonderful news, honey. My little girl roughing it in nature. Don't get too excited, I'm calling you from a piano bench in Piru. By your standards, this place is bougie as fuck. Put your phone on speaker and let me hear you play. Mom, you missed all of my recitals. It was a rough time. - For both of us. - I'm here now. - Via telephone. - Oh, enough. Just play the goddamn piano. Fine. Harvey, Harvey. Harvey. Harvey. Harvey. Harvey! What'd you think? Mom? Did I lose you? No, no, I'm here. I'm here. That was, um... That was wonderful. Listen, I'm gonna text you the address. If you call and I don't pick up, I'm being objectified and tortured by a hillbilly. Boy... it's your father. I'm sorry I yelled at you the other day. I... I know you don't like voicemails, but since you're not answering your phone, you're not leaving me any other choice. I hope you're good on money. I don't understand, Harvey. What's going on? This was never part of the plan. What plan? What the hell are you talking about? My boy thinks I'm losing my mind. He thinks I have dementia. But I'm as fit as a goddamn fiddle. He wants to put me in a nursing home. He calls it an assisted living center. But we both know that that's just putting lipstick on a pig. I've lived a good life. Traveled the world... contributed to the community, I've known true love. I've done it all, except for one thing. I don't know how it feels to kill someone. That's an itch I never got around to scratching. Shh, calm down. Calm down. I'm not gonna kill you yet. The thought of it breaks my heart. I'm gonna go get that... young lady. I'm gonna take care of her, and then I'm gonna come back for you. You've been such a good friend to the family over the years. I'm gonna make sure this is painless as possible, I give you my word. Harvey, don't you do it. Yeah, no shit. Hmm, and what do you want? Can I speak with you? Okay. Okay, so... Crystal, I came here with an open heart and an open mind to express my feelings for you. You are powerful, confident and a deeply sexual force, that has drawn me in. And I know we have chemistry, but you continue to resist my advances. Why? You are cute. There's no way around that. But you're also kind of a douche. Uh, if I were to work on de-douchifying myself, would you consider me then? - Oh, my god. - Oh, yeah. - I've been wa... Yeah, I'm ready. - Come here. Come here. - There you go. - Okay. Atta boy. - Well... - Mm-hmm. There you go, there you go. How's that? Wait, is that your fuckin' phone? Shh. It's okay, shh, shh. - Shh. Shh. - That's your phone. - Can we just... - It's all good, you're good. It didn't go as planned. I got a case of the jitters. Can you believe that? Me? With a case of the jitters. Who am I kidding? We both know no one can hear us. I gotta tell ya, turning a dream into a reality is no easy task. - Especially when it's murder. - Can you think about Edith? Imagine what she'd say. Why dwell in the past? Good old days are over and done with. You ever stop to think it wasn't so good for the rest of us? We both know you had her trapped in that marriage, holding custody over her head. So don't you go rewriting history, like it was all peaches and cream. She suffered from clinical depression. You should've seen her. She couldn't raise that boy on her own. The burden fell on me. Show some goddamn compassion. Oh, Harvey, get over yourself. The only good you ever had in you was because of her. Suppose so! Jesus Christ. I didn't really think this through. You really hurt my feelings, Agnes. You really hurt my feelings. - God damn it. - Who are you? Who are you? I'm renting the house for the weekend. Crazy old man should not be making decisions like that without consulting me first. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you. I'm David. I'm Harvey's son. - Olive. - Pleasure. I'll be gone in a minute. I just gotta get some prototypes out of the attic. I'm sending my latest and greatest to the Shark Tank. Hmm. Hey, you know what? Since I have you here, would... Would you mind if I ran through my pitch? Please leave. Right, right, right, of course. Well, enjoy the rest of your stay. I'm terribly sorry, Agnes. You deserve a proper burial. And I'll see that you get one. You're a good woman. A strong woman. Not like most of you. Brunchin' bimbos. Gettin' drunk off your skinny girl margaritas. Cavorting around with your jobless fedora clad boyfriends. Sunglasses are for the outside. Sundays are for the Lord.

What are you doing here, Rodrigo? Don't you wanna know why we broke up? I already do. 'Cause you're a cheating asshole masked under the guise of a sensitive artist. Here we go again with the name calling. I didn't wanna cheat on you. - You drove me to it. - I hope you get syphilis. Funny you should say that. I'm actually on antibiotics right now. Fuck off. - You've got to be kidding me. - Long time no see. - Not long enough. - Remember what a pain in the ass it always was, deciding on a place to eat? I'm not saying that's why we broke up, but come to think of it, it was one of your more annoying qualities. I have food allergies. Sue me. Sue you for what? You don't even have anything. Well, I'm doing better now. So, fuck off. Oh, really? Well, maybe I will sue you. Cool, I'll sue you back for wearing all natural deodorant that never worked. And then casually farting, so as to eliminate any semblance of sexual attractiveness and then forgetting to lock up my bike the night that it was stolen. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. See you in court. Get the fuck out of my acid dream. - Yo. - Yo. You're cool. I just wasn't ready to settle down. I always appreciated you for being up front about that. Though it was annoying how you used all the toilet paper wrapping up your tampons - before you threw 'em away. - I did that as a courtesy. - I'm just sayin'. - God, you know what, now I remember why I hate you. - Jesus. - Fuck you, Olive! - Dad. - What's up, sweet pea? I'm tripping. - On acid. - Oh, groovy. You know, it seems your mother is really into that stuff. I was never into psychedelics. I was just more of a uppers guy. Yeah well, after you killed yourself... Dad, she lost her mind. She, like, ran away... and my whole life she's been living - in a fantasy world. - Well, you know, baby, from my vantage point, looking down, it seems that pretty much everyone is in their own little fantasy world to one degree or another. And it's all so counterproductive. Well, so is suicide. I know it's hard for you to understand. But I was hurting... deeply... for many years. And I just couldn't... beat it. But I'm happy now. And I want you to be happy. Wait, are you... Are you advocating for me - to kill myself, too? - No! No, Jesus. No. Do yourself a favor, and get rid of my ashes. It's not so important that they be scattered to the cosmos. I just did that to piss your mother off, because she over scheduled our last vacation to Washington D.C. and did not give me enough time at the National Air and Space Museum. Well, if you're wondering why I'm not just bursting with joy it's probably because you killed yourself. And Mom's insane and I got this stack of student loans, like, a mile high and I'm basically alone in the world, and my ovaries are drying up. But how about you start with not settling for all those bozos? - It kills me to see... - Wait, you better not be able to watch me have sex from up there. I always look away. - Always. - Well, forgive me for not being the best picker. All right? I was deprived of a proper male role model - growing up. - Got me there. Well, I'm so sorry, baby. I'm sorry I missed your piano recital. But I can hear you playing, from up here. And you are... - great! - Really? Fantastic stuff. Thanks, Dad. - I love you, sweet pea. - I love you too, Dad. You keep playing that piano. I will. Dad? Dad? This land is my land. This land is my land. California, to the New York island. From the redwood forest... to the Gulf Stream water.

I didn't really give it much thought, I'm... I'm terribly sorry for your trouble. Been some vacation. Well... I'll give you a full refund in the morning. It wouldn't be right any other way.

Was just havin' some fun with ya. Those were veneers! Oh, God! Jeez! Hey. - What happened, guys? - Oh, we got a flat and we're really in a big hurry. I've never changed a tire before in my life, and this one's skill sets don't go far beyond juggling and playing the bongos. Could I get a little personal space here, buddy? Oh, we... We don't really believe in personal space. It's like a thing where, you know... - Uriah! - Sorry. Sorry. There you go. I'll get you guys out of here in no time. Great! Fuck! You're a little rascal, aren't ya? Why are you doing this? Put down that letter opener. It's got sentimental value. Atta girl. Oh, can't thank you enough. It's nice to know there's still good people out there. That's right, the beauty is in the moment, isn't it? - What's his name again? - Uriah. Fuck off, Uriah. I'm good, I'm just gonna, you know... living for the... No, no. What the fuck, man! - What is this? - Used to be my wife's dress. If this is a sexual thing, I'm just gonna be straight up with you. I've got HPV. Special strain that melts old man's dicks off. It's the very dress she was wearing, the day she took her own life. I know what that's like. My pops killed himself, too. Small fuckin' world. My deepest condolences. So, backtracking, for just a moment. Um, what the fuck am I doing wearing your dead wife's dress and why the fuck are you trying to kill me with... Is that a tomahawk? Textbook cultural appropriation, man. Jesus. It's nothing personal. It's not you, it's just, it... It's everything you represent. Oh, cool, cool. So I'm essentially taking this one for the team. Just my fuckin' luck. I thought we might have some fun. Maybe this would be therapeutic. You do play, don't you? Yeah, I... It's always been my dream. When I was a kid... we didn't have dreams. We just worked hard. Then what the fuck are you so nostalgic for? A time long ago, when men were men and women knew it. And little girls like you knew to shut your god damn mouths. I know... your type. You like to think that folks like me are uncultured swine, but I'm a great admirer of the arts. As of late, I've been particularly fascinated by Last Works. When you get to be my age... you start to develop a real strong sense of mortality. Look, you want me to play the fucking piano just say, "Play the fucking piano." - Play the fuckin' piano. - Great! You don't love me, Harvey. You never loved me. You don't even know what love is. Stop. Stop. I said, stop! Stop! Stop! You're awful. Just plain awful. Tell me that was a joke. What? You mean, you didn't know? Fucking Millennials. Jesus, Uriah, come on, let's go! Oh, Uriah, just stop the car! - Oh, God, let's just go. - Oh! Oh, my God. Doing a service to mankind. Bashing your brains in. Thanks again for coming with me.

Oh, that's my baby. Open the door! I'm trying to open, it's... It's locked. Honey! Open this. Get this open now, come on. Uriah, get this open. Oh, that's my baby, open it. Open the door. This is, like, a deadbolt lock or something. Look out. I just need to... I just gotta focus, okay? I need some space to focus. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna! Oh. Oh! I am so gonna let you fuck me when we get home. Hey. You just killed my piece of ass, motherfucker. There's something I really need to tell you.

But I realize now it was the wrong thing to do. - Mom. - Yes, dear? - You wanna do me a favor? - Anything. Hmm. Call me an ambulance. In case you haven't noticed, I'm bleeding profusely. You accidentally shot me. Pretty much a metaphor for our entire relationship. Yeah. Go figure. 911. What is your emergency? I need an ambulance immediately. My daughter's been shot. What's the address, please? 8754 Hillcreek Road. Do you know how she was shot? By me. - You shot her? - Yeah. - But it was an accident. - Help is on the way. Please stay on the line. No, no, I won't stay on the line. You want me to get cancer? Just get over here. God, Mom. Sorry about your friend. Eh, boys these days, they're a dime a dozen. Who's the hot mess now, you salty old douchnozzle? Bankrupt the country, not smart. Destroy the environment, not cool. Try to kill me... not a chance. Fuckin' baby boomers. - Three, two, one. - Three, two, one. I feel good about it if you do. Yeah. Your father would have appreciated the effort. - I'm starving. - Let's eat. ♪ I saw it you and me ♪ ♪ In time part ♪ ♪ I get a shiver From broken hearts ♪ ♪ I like sun Where it don't shine ♪ ♪ I make it hard on anyone ♪ ♪ So many restless souls ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ In the roll In the spring time dust ♪ ♪ I love you way too much ♪ ♪ So I wonder where to go ♪ ♪ When love lose way too slow ♪ ♪ So when hearts stay Will explode ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ All talk is a waste of time ♪ ♪ 'Cause in dreams You're always mine ♪ ♪ Why they burn With such delight ♪ ♪ A leave of joy Awake and rhyme ♪ ♪ So many times I've lost control ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ I saw it you and me ♪ ♪ In time apart ♪ ♪ I get a shiver From broken hearts ♪ ♪ I like the sun Where it don't shine ♪ ♪ I make it hard on anyone ♪ ♪ So many restless souls ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ So many restless souls ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be Young and cold ♪ ♪ Take it from me ♪ ♪ Never ever try to fool me ♪ ♪ Take it from me ♪ ♪ Never ever try to fool me ♪ ♪ I know what I want I know what I want ♪ ♪ And I know what I want ♪ ♪ I know what I want ♪ ♪ I know what I want ♪ ♪ I know what I want I know what I want ♪ ♪ I know what I want ♪ ♪ Take it from me ♪ ♪ Never ever try to ruin me ♪ ♪ Take it from me ♪ ♪ Never ever try to ruin me ♪ ♪ I know what I want I know what I want ♪ ♪ And I know what I want I know what I want ♪ ♪ I know what I want I know what I want ♪ ♪ And I know what I want I know what I want ♪ ♪ Take it from me ♪ ♪ Never ever try to ruin me ♪
