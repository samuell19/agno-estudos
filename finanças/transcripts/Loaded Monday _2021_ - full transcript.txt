(BLUES MUSIC PLAYING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (LOUD CRASH) Hey! The police ae here. Come on! Wake up! Relax Julia. Relax? Relax. Down on the ground! Oh my God! Get on the ground! You on the ground! Get off the bed Campbell! Turn around. Put your hands behind your head. What the hell is going on? We have rights. Cuff him. Give me the other hand. You don't know what you just started. Looks to me like I just ended it. Get him out of here. God damnit Roberts. Where are you? I've got something I need to talk to you about. Call me as soon as you get this. (CAR DRIVING AWAY) What? Terry, you have a serious problem. I can assure you. Our intelligence was- The validity of your intel is another matter. I'm going to make this short and clear. There will be a press conference this morning. And I will be standing right next to my client. A what- Do not interrupt me! I am sure that there are a lot of fine officers in your department that deserve a promotion. And I'm beginning to think a change in leadshership may be necessary. Going after Campbell. That's not a good career move Terry. Not only is he the Mayor, but he contributes a lot of money to this community. Don't you tell me how to run my department- I suggest you cease this fishing expedition! (PHONE CLICKS) Okay. I'll check back on that. Gillespey! Long time no see. I saw you last week. Hey. What's with all the press in the council chamber? Campbell and Conti are holding a press conference. They let him go? I'm gonna let Terry fill you in on that. Fill me in on what? Last night. Both locations were clean. No. No, we missed something. Where are you going? I'm going to tear that place apart. The house and the warehouse. No. You're not going anywhere. I'm not going to sit around here while that scumbag walks free. Just get in here and bring your partner. He's not here. That's just like him to go missing when the shit hits the fan. Evans! Would you tell Marks to get his ass in my office as soon as he walks through that door. Yes sir. You gonna tell me what the hell is going on? Well, I just got off the phone with Conti. She's right. Campbell's too hot for us right now. Without some kind of tangible evidence in my hands, this case is closed. Closed? We've spent 5 years on this case. Yeah. Five years and nothing to show for it. No emails, no phone calls, no narcotics. Not one solid piece of evidence that ties Campbell to illegal activity. So he's smarter than he looks. But you're giving him too much credit. We just got access to his house. Give me an hour, and I'll get you what you need. No. Absolutely not. I'm lucky to have my job right now. Campbell's got the upper hand. He's about to walk out on that podium with Conti. Well, what are we supposed to do? Just stand here and do nothing? We don't have a choice. You walk out there right now, and Campbell is going to personally deliver me a box to clean out my office. At least he's not carrying a box. Nicely done Conti. They look like they're going to a charity event instead of walking out of jail. As you all know, a pillare of our community has been falsely accused of a variety of fabricated crimes, and unjustly arrested by an out of control police department on a witch hunt. I do not understand what, or who is behind this attempt of of character assassination, but I will continue to make this situation right. And clear whatever harm may have come to Mayor Campbell's good name. Willy will now make a brief statement from the heart. Thank you Nicole. First, I would like to thank the beautiful people of Goldwater. For standing by me and my family with this unfortunate situation. Looking out, I recognize a lot of you from many of the charity functions I've been honored to sponsor. Rest assured, my donatoins to these charities will not lessen. Not as a result to the loss of production that this police depart ment has caused. No hungry child, or homeless family will suffer from the loss of revenue. Again; I want to thank you. Wonderful people of this city Great city of Goldwater I hope you find it in your hearts to forgive the hard working law enforcement officers who made a mistake. I know as Mayor, I will. Thank you. (NEWS MUSIC) Still no word on Marks? We just had a robbery call come in. Looks like Evans is going to be partnering up with you on this one. Just get down to 16th and Main. Market owner is already on scene with Keely. We're on it. Can you try and play by the book today? I'll be on my best behavior. Can you believe that guy? You Marks? Let's get this over with. Seriously, do you even know what you're doing right now? Ma'am, please don't touch me. Okay, I can't touch you if I want to touch you. Please don't touch me. because I am not in a good place right now. Listen to me. I am here to help you. Oh are you? Are you? Yes I am. Yes. I don't even think you know what you're doing. I understand that, but I do. So you're gonna have to understand. How long have you been a cop? Mornin' Keely. Morning detectives. What do you got for us? Not much. Store was broken in sometime between 11 last night and 7 this morning. Spent most of the time trying to calm her down. She was pretty irate when I got here. Okay. Go inside and check it out. Hey. I am detective Evans, Hi. this is my partner detective Roberts We'd just like to ask you a couple questions. You know, I've already told him everything. I kmow, I'm sorry. We're are here to help, so if you could just one more time. One more time. Fine. Alright, it must have happened lst night some time. And they went in and destroyed the inside of my store. Was there anybody that could have possibly seen anything? No. We were closed when it happened. And we only run security cameras when the store is open. Alright. We'll take a look around. (GUN SHOT) Stop, police! Johnny! Call 911, we have an officer down! (GUN SHOTS) Marks.. Johnny! Alright. Jason Huh? Did you really think you were going to out run me? Officer Keely. We got one down. 16th and Main. 16th and Main. Officer down. I need two paramedics. Three officers. Code blue. Haven't you seen how these things end on TV? I want to talk to my lawyer. Yeah, you'll talk to your lawyer. Alright, let's go. Come on! Seriously? Roberts, go put the suspect in the car. Why? What are you- Just trust me. You piece of shit! You mother- No, no, no! Let go of me! God damnit! I'm alright, I'm alright. Do you know who that man is? You know who that fucking man is? That's my hero. That's he man who taught me to be the cop that I am today. And I've seen him do things that I did not imagine myself doing until now. (YELLING) You better hold him back. What the fuck man. I tell you what. you better arrest him before I end this permanently. Good morning sir. It's good to be home. Did you take care of what I asked? Yes I did. I sent Jason to pick up the package. You sent Jason. That kid doesn't use his head. That package better not fall into the wrong hands. I've had enough of the dealings with police for a while. Don't worry. Everything is being taken care of. You do remember the last time you sent him out to take care of something? I know. But this was easy. There's no money involved, There's no thinking involved. All he's gotta do is be there, and then bring the package to us. If this doesn't go smoothly, we could have some problems. Marks is a cop, and he can make it difficult for us. I understand that. But if I may, sir. I think things would go a lot smoother for both of us if Marks was out of the way. That's not up for debate. And if there are any mishaps today, You'll have bigger problems than Jason to worry about. Good morning! Oh, Good morning Anna! Don't get up. I brought you some coffee. Oh thank you. Nothing like the smell of morning coffee. Would you like a cup? If it isn't- (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) It'll take a few minutes. I'll have to brew a fresh pot. Don't worry- You know, Jennings just stopped by for a few minutes to talk business. So just us a moment. Of course. See you later. Anna. You should have handled this yourself. He can handle it. If anything goes wrong, I'll take care of it personally. Nothing should happen. That's the whole point. You will learn to listen. I'll oversee things from the warehouse. I can take care of it! God damnit! Marks was shot dead by a freakin' street punk. He was everything to me. He taught me everything I know. And I wasn't there for him when he needed me the most. A God damn street punk! We were together everyday for nearly 10 years, and where was I when he needed me? I pulled Marks' badge off his body. Take a look on the back, and see if there is a set of numbers. Oh yeah. There's a couple numbers. 4, 8... 4, 8, 5. What's that, what's that mean? He told me that he keep this evidence locker of his, or a combination briefcase in his house. There were... I don't know what he kept in there. It was like his own personal evidence locker. Or something. Alright, we're going over there now. (BLUES MUSIC) What the hell are you two doing in here? Shouldn't you be in school or something? Nah. I hate school. We have more important things to do. Yeah! Oh yeah. LIke what? Like working for you and making some money. Oh yeah? We want to get a car. You're not even old enough to drive. I can't drive yet, but I'll let my mom drive until I get a license. Follow me. (GUN SHOT) Knock it off! Clean this up. Richie, make use of the kid. Congratulations kid. You're in. This is Marks' place? Yeah, this is it. Where would he keep the briefcase? Good question. I guess we just start looking around. You sure it was a briefcase? I think so. You take that side, I'll take this side? Yep. Look at all these bins. Are we going to have to go through every single one of them? I guess so. So heavy... Oh, oh. I got it! There's a briefcase. There it is! Let's check it out. Here I go. What's all this? Evidence locker? It looks like it. Is that Campbell? Yeah, that's campbell. No doubt about it. Bank statements from Palmeras del Sol. That's Campbell's company. Right? Yeah. And then there's deposits. Every month for the past two years. Was he working on the case this morning? I don't see another explanation. Let's take it in and show chief. Okay. (TENSE MUSIC) (GUNS FIRING) (GUNS FIRING) Have you seen my grandfather? You should learn to knock. He isn't here. Where did he go? To the warehouse. Is there anything I can do for you? No. You know. Your grandfather really loves having a 29 year-old-girl living with him. Personally, if I were you, I'd find a man before you dry up. It's for your own good sweetie. When I was your age, I was- Sleeping your way to the top! No sweetie! I was taking care of myself. Modeling in Milan. Paris. Shooting commercials in Los Angeles. And now? Now I'm- Living off my grandfather. Remember. I'm the one who can whisper into your granfather's ear at night. I'd watch my tounge if I were you. You really should learn to knock. If your grandfather were here, who knows what you may have walked in on. Are we done here? I know you have to go run off to church, and light some candles. Whatever you do there. What is it? We have a problem. What the hell is the problem? They... Game over. Come on man. I was just about to- I said gave over. Now get the fuck outta the table. Now what's the problem? They didn't get the pictures. Two cops were already there. Shit! He got you. Mitchell. Hello detectives. Hey. How long does it take you to run a bak account? Not long at all. No? Can you run this? Sorry, chief is on my back I've got a ton of work on Marks' death. Well this is about Marks. We found them at his place. It's bank statements. Palmeras del Sol huh? I'll get to it as soon as I can. As soon as you can? Hold on, hold on. Do you remember what happened at last year's Christmas party? Do I ever. We had a great time. Yeah, we had a great time. And if I remember correctly, someone had a very good time. No, no. You promised. You know. I couldn't remember what happened for the longest time. But suddenly it all came back to me. Karaoke. Free shots. More free shots. And then chief's favorite golf club- It was an accident. Okay. I'll do it. But this is blackmail. It's an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. Cayman Islands... Even with a warrant, and pressure from the Feds, You won't get anything. Chief! You know I wouldn't have said anything. Right? Alright. I'll see you soon. Now what were you trying to tell me on the way over here? Been waiting on a phone call. I didn't want to bother you with this, but- Spit it out. Listen, Mr. Mayor. I don't want to worry you. The cops got Jason. But Conti should be with him by now. I already spoke with Conti. I'm not concerned about that. What about the pictures? We didn't find them. There were two cops there when they arrived. But for all we know, Marks didn't even have them at the house. They could be in a safe deposit box at the First National Bank. That's what I figured. I over estimated you. I'll need to take care of this myself. What the hell do you want me to do about it? Just don't screw anything else up. Alright fill me in. What happened here? There were two cops here when we got here. One of them busted me in the lip. Before I even saw him. What about the pictures? I don't know. We didn't even get a chance to look in the safe until just now. It's empty. I've heard enough. (GUN SHOTS) Clean this mess up. I'm going home to make arrangements. Here it is. What now? The evidence. Marks told me that if anything ever happened to hm, there was a combination briefcase in his house. The answer to everything is inside. And we found it. We ot bank statements and photos. And the logo on the top, Palmeras del Sol. Hmm. That's Campbell's company. Yep. And there's 10 to 15k deposited into the same account over the last couple years. Did you trace the account number? Yeah. Offshore account in the Cayman Islands. Too uch red tape. But that's not even all. We got these photos too. Yeah, that is Campbell. And that's the guy we arrested this morning. Yeah. Maybe this is what got Marks killed. Just let us bring him in. What ever he was up to he was doing without a warrant. None of this is admissible. You were his partner. Did he mention anything about any of this to you? No. Look. It's outta my hands detectives. I.A. is crawling all over this place today. You guys might want to get out of here for a couple of hours. And stay away from Campbell. Let things cool down. Yes sir. Roberts? Yes sir. (BLUES MUSIC) We need to take advantage of this opportunity. You sure? Everything I've been preparing for, everything I've ever wanted. The moment is now. We're ready. Alright. Here's what we're gonna do. First... You be cool, because remember, we are not even supposed to be here. I think you should just let me handle it. Okay. I'll be cool. Okay. Follow my lead then. You got it. Hello. How can I help you? Good morning. ma'am. I am detective Roberts, this is detective Evans. We are with the Goldwater Police Department. And we would like to speak with Mr. Campbell. I'm not sure if he's here. Just do us a favor and go get him. Right now. I think what she meant to say was, no problem, go ahead and check and we'll wait right here I'll be right back. I thought you said to let you handle this? I did, and I handled it. Okay. Your head was spinning. I could see it, and she could see it. Two detectives are outside. What do they want? To talk to my grandfather. You told them he's not here, right? Not exactly. I told them I would check. Why? I don't know. I froze. This is what I'm talking about. You need to grow up. We're not going to be here to hold your hand through everything. I don't need you to hold my hand. Sure you don't. (BREAKING GLASS) God damnit. Look what you made me do! I'm not the one that needs their hand held. You heard that? Let's go in. What? No. Are you insane? Wait. Someone's coming. You two? You're unbelievable. Are you here to arrest more innocent people? Lokk Miss Burn- I was told you were here to talk to Willy? I'm sorry, but he isn't here right now.. Miss Burn. Me and my partner- We're here to offer our formal apology on behalf of the entire department. In behalf of this entire family, your apology is not accepted. Umm, yeah. Well, we heard a loud crash inside. Is everything alright? I just had a little accident. No big deal. You two are okay? What about that woman who answered the door. What's her story? Oh, how sweet. But I don't think Anna's much into cops. You can tell Willy yourself- Anna! I'll let you get back to what you were doing Miss Burn. Goodbye detective. I'm sure we'll be seeing you again Miss Burn. Buh-bye. I still have a couple questions to ask you. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Your grandfather. There's evidence of his involvement in a murder this morning. I really need to speak to him. Julia can answer all your questions. I'm sorry. I've got to go, I'm really late. No, I understand. But Julia is not cooperating. I'm really sorry, but I'm late. I've gotta go. Julia can answer all your questions. Anna wait. My partner was killer this morning, and we have evidence connecting your grandfather. I need to know where he is. You think my grandfather had something to do with your partner's murder now? Can you guys do anymore damage to my family in one day? I don't see it that way. Obviously not. I'm sorry, I'm late. I have to go. I can't help you. Anna wait! Get in. We'll go to the station and see if we can get anything ot of Jason. Where is he? Look. Before you say anything else. I know how much Marks meant to you. I.A. is crawling all over the place today. They're interviewing everybody. I don't think it's a good idea- You know what's not a good idea? Letting that punk sit there safely in custody, While Marks' ex wife is down at the morgue identifying the body. Calm down detective. You're not the only one who lost someone here today. Marks was like a brother to me. We went to the same school, lived on the same street. We graduated from the academy together. Chief- Look we got the son of a bitch who killed him. I'm not going to jeopardize anything else. If I may. I agree with you chief. Roberts isn't really being himself after the shooting. And he's not exactly known for going by the book. Thanks for the support partner. Terry's right. Just will be served. I get it. I.A. is here. But one of us has to go talk to him. What for? You guys are eye witnesses. It's an open and shut case. We believe Campbell is behind this. And Jason, he may give us a lead. Here we go. Didn't neither of you learn anything from this morning? I totally agree, but... I still think that we should probably talk to Jason before Conti gets here. Listen, we're all still lucky to have our jobs, and you want me to let you go in there and destroy what's left of this department? Stay away from Ccampbell. That's an order. This may be our only chance. Alright, fine. But make sure Roberts doesn't do anything stupid. Yes sir. Let's go. Interrogation room C. And hurry, Conti should have been here by now. (HEART BEAT) Has he said anything? Nothing. We're gonna need you to turn off those cameras when we go in there. You know, if anything happens to this prisoner, it's my ass. Nothing is gonna happen to him. You've got my word. Look at him. Sitting there. Arrogant, thinking Campbell and Conti make him untouchable. I think Conti is on the way up. We got to make this quick. No matter what happens. Don't open that door for anyone. Got it. We have a few questions to ask you. Yeah, I know my rights. And I'm not saying anything another word until my lawyer is here. Yeah? I believe that's what he was saying the last time I saw him with his face down in the cement. You know, when my knee was crushing your shoulder blades. You don't have to remind me. I'll be pressing charges for police brutality. You killed an officer this morning. I don't think you understand how much trouble you're actually in. She's in the building. Conti's in the building. Well save your breath cop, because you guys can't touch me. We don't have time for this, this bullshit. Did Campbell send you to kill detective Marks? I don't know shit about nothing, and I'm not saying another word until my lawyer is here. Go it? Did Campbell send you? She's coming down the hallway. Hurry up! That's enough! Are you kidding me? This guy's fucking crazy! Roberts. Eye for an eye. Right! Sorry, I didn't see you there. You should be more careful. Open the door. I'm here to see my client. Get that animal away from my client! You're going away for a long time buddy. What's going on in here? This police force is out of control! Evans. What the hell happened here? Both of you. In my office now. I told you I.A. would b watching our every move. I acted alone. It was my idea. Evans had nothing to do with it. Did you go over to Campbell's all alone to, because I just got a call from a very irate Julia Burn. I drove the car there. As a matter of fact, Evans tried to stop me. Wait a minute. I've been on this force 7 years. And I've always played by the book. And now you're letting I.A. just push us around. Detective- No Terry! You're treating us like the criminals and Campbell and his men are walking free! My hands are tied. There's nothing I can do about it now. Just give us the order. I can not be any clearer. Stay away from Campbell. It's out of my hands. Give me your guns and badges. You two are both suspended indefinately. And a word of advice. Take a couple weeks and let things cool down a little bit. I don't want you two brought back in here in handcuffs. Anna, hello! It's so good to see you on such a beautiful Monday afternoon. Although I can't help but wondering, what's troubling you my child? I'm torn father. I fear my grandfather may be involved in something. Oh? What happened? A police officer was killed. That's been all over the news. And with the situation between your family and the police. But why do you think he's involved? Two detectives came to our house this morning and wanted to speak with him. Your grandfather does a lot for the community and the church. I just find it very hard to believe that he would be involved in that police officer's death. I need your guidance father. The answer is inside you my dear. I can see it in your eyes. God has spoken to you. And you know what he asks. What if I don't have the strength to do what he asks of me? I remember the first day you wondered in here alone. You couldn't have been more than 6-years-old. You even fell asleep in one of the pews. Your eyes have the same lost look in them today as they did that Sunday morning. I felt safe here. I didn't want to leave. When you told me you were lost, you were afraid, and alone. Do you remember what I told you? Don't be afraid. God gives me strength and always watches over me. That hasn't changed. He's with you now. And I believe you already possess the answer you seek. You see, we all have an inate morality inside of us. Just some people are afraid to use it, and fail do the right thing. Anna, you are different. You have never faltered along the way. Even with all the temptations of the world surrounding you. You're right. Thank you father. I know what I need to do. Good. I'll leave you to finish your prayers. May God bless and keep you my child. Thank you father. Officer Gillespey. Hey, I was wondering if we have time to talk about the case you- Robinson, I don't have time. No, it's a great time. I've got more important things to do. We can talk about my stuff- No, I don't have time! Get out of the way Robinson! Chief. Open the door chief. You can't just ignore me. What are we doing now? We? I'm going to catch him. Uh, we partner. I'm coming with I've already brought enough heat on you. Come on detective. There was never a gun to my head. Yeah? Yeah. Alright, well- I'm driving. Shit Willy. Sit down! You're driving me crazy pacing back and forth. After how you handled the press this morning, Every cop in the state of Arizona is going to be scared to come within a 100 feet of you. Except the two today. Marks had evidence connecting me and Palmeras to 90% of the goddamn heroin in this town. Marks? Isn't that the cop that died this morning? Teah. Shit! Willy, I can't go to prison. Nobody's going to prison. We'll head to Mexico. I hate Mexico. I could see this coming for a few months now. Jennings really fucked this up. I need a drink. Want one? Yeah, vodka. Relax baby. Relax baby. You said so yourself. We have nothing to worry about. That feels so good. (PHONE RINGING) Yes sir. Can I please speak with detective Roberts? Your name? Anna Campbell. Hold on one second. Chief Smith. Sir, I have Anna Campbell here to see detective Roberts. Anna Campbell? Yes sir. Don't let her leave, I'll be right there. Yes sir. He'll be with you shortly. Thank you. Miss Campbell. Who are you? I'm Chief Smith, but you can call me Terry. I asked to speak with detective Roberts. He's not here right now. Is there something I can assist you with? I don't think so. I really need to speak with him. And there's nothing I can do to help? I'm sure. Thank you. I wanted to apologize for what happened to your family this morning. If there's anything at all I can do, don't hesitate to call me. There's Jennings. And the guy with long hair, I think I locked him up for armed robbery like a year ago. Yeah. He's back out on the street being a productive member of society. Anna! I don't like where this is headed. Roberts... Damn it. Chief. We're here, I can't explain. But Roberts just went inside. Please send backup. Anna! Are you going to tell me what you're doing here? Your grandfather had some concerns, so he asked us to be here. But to tell you the truth, I came here to see you. Don't touch me. Don't pretend Anna. I see the way you look at me. What are you talking about? Oh Anna. You gotta stop fighting it. I've got big plans for us. Big plans. Plans? You disgust me! I suggest you stop talking to me that way. I have a tendancy to lose my temper. Get your hands off me! I told you to shut your mouth! Touch her again, and the coroner will be here to pick up your dead body. I take it you two know eachother? You want to hit someone? Why don't you come over here and take a swing at me. I think we got off on the wrong foot detecitve. Who's this? your knight in shining armor? You don't want to hit someone who's going to hit you back? Drop your gun! Drop your gun! Let her go Jennings. Put it down, now! Put down your gun, now! Okay, relax. There. Back up. Richie! Who's this? This... This is our friend. Detective Roberts. What do you want to do with him? I don't know. But someone needs to teach him a little respect. We can do that. Hold it right there. Don't move! I knew there was another one. I could smell her. Drop your guns. You're under arrest. I don't think so. I'd listen to her Jennings. Is that so? Turn around tough guy. I may not have graduated with honors, but I'd say the odds are in our favor. Now drop your weapon! What's going on out there? Two detectives. Evans and Roberts. Are they alone? Yeah, I'm sure. If there was more, we'd know by now. Bring them in. Right away. Why are you here detective? My lawyer told me you've been ordered to stay away. Have it your way. Just make sure richie finds those pictures. And if he doesn't want to talk? Kill him. Grandfather! Hey! You know as well as I do, our lives are over if they get their hands on those pictures. But they're police officers. I don't see any badges. They're trespassers. Don't do this. Not another word. I'm worried about her sir. She was saying a lot of crazy thngs, not making a lot of sense. Like what? I hate to say it, but I think her and the detective have a little secret. Something's going on there. Get him to talk. And if there is anything else. I want to know about it. I'll take care of it. What's he goning to do to him? Anna, I don't want to hear anymore. (MAN GETTING PUNCHED) Jennings is gonna be coming soon. He's not as nice as me. So you might as well tell me. Hey. It's no skin off my back. But it will be off yours. Sounds like I'm a little late to the party. This guy, is not as tough as he thinks he is. Wake up! Things would go a lot easier if you just tell us where those pictures are. You're under arrest. For your involvment, in the murder of my partner. I'm what? Get a load of this guy. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say- Can and will be used against you- Now. Tell us where those pictures are. I think I know why you're here. I saw the way you looked at Anna. You do know she's mine. Right? You have a funny way of showing it. What? You like smacking women around? Makes you feel real tough? I do like beating the shit out of you! Why don't you take these cuffs off. We'll see how tough you- Shut your mouth! I see respect is a difficult concept for you. Maybe I'll just carve it. Right out of your flesh. How would that feel detective? Huh? I'd let your guts spill all over the floor. Oh shit. Boss. It's time. I was just starting to have fun. Watch him Richie. Have fun detective. Have a seat. Would you like a drink? Have we met before? You look familiar. No. I apologize for meating under such uncomfortable circumstances But, Julia said you stopped by earlier today. I did. Okay. We've never met eachother. And yet, two visits in one day. To what do I owe the pleasure? You know why I'm here. I have an idea. Then you know that I'm here to arrest you. It doesn't look like it's headed in that direction, but okay. I'll play along. What are the charges? How about, drug trafficking? And accessory to the murder of detective Johnny Marks. I had nothing to do with the murder of that detective. As a matter of fact, You could call Marks a friend. Now, as far as drug trafficing, I'm the mayor of this city. And that is outrageous for you to even claim it. I know exactly who you really are, and what you really do. We both know, if you had anything to connect me to these accusations, I'd be sitting in a cell right now. Em, it's time. What the hell is this? Time for a change Willy. What change? Sir. It's time for me to take a larger role in this opperation. Things have changed out there. While you've been in this large house, while all your money. And all your cars. And Julia. I'll gladly accept your resignation. Whether or not you go peacefully and quietly. Well that's gonna be up to you. My replacement has already been chosen. But when I decide it's time. You disrespectful- No need to thank me. Sit down Willy. What are you gonna do? Shoot me? Now you listen to me, you young punk. You'll never be half the man Willy is. I'm sorry you feel that way. Go ahead. No! Well, Willy. Looks like now I'm officially next in line. I'd be scared if I were you. You have no idea what Jennings is capable of. That's because you're a pansy. What are you saying? I'm still breathing. You should fear me. (RICHIE LAUGHING) Of you? Richie! Let him go! What are you doing here? We don't have a lot of time. Get him down! I'm tired of playing these games. I'm gonna watch you breathe your last breath. Are you alright? Never been better. Get the keys out of his pockets. Thank you. We have to go. Where is everyone? They're all upstairs in the living room. Hold on. Let's go. You coward. Pick him up. You're never going to get away with this. Wrong. Who's gonna stop me? You? Or maybe that partner of yours who's hanging around downstairs? I'm not going to rest until you're behind bars. Wrong detective. You're not even going to make it out of here alive. In fact, you won't even be the first cop I killed today. You're responsible? That's right. I hate cops. Especially those who interfere in my business. You destroyed in one day, what took me a lifetime to create. This is something I should have done a long time ago. No! Em, get her off of me! (GUN SHOT) (SCREAMING) Em. Kill this bitch. I'm getting him downstairs. You broke my nose! (COUGHING) How bad are you hit? You're gonna be okay. Help's on the way. I hope. Does he keep a gun in here? Maybe in one of the shelves. Get down! Jennings is gonna be back soon. You sure there's no gun here? Nothing is here. Things got a little messy upstairs. Let's kill this guy and get the hell out of here. What the- Richie! Oh you wanna play detective? You wanna play? Well come out, come out. Wherever you are. Let's go. Stay down. Where are you going? I'm gonna distract him. When you get a chance, run! Are you crazy? You don't have a gun! Don't worry about me. Take care of yourself. Come out, come out. Wherever you are. Nevermind. He's coming. Come out detective. Can't leave in the middle of a game. That's rude. I'm gonna count to three. One. Two. You're hit. I'm alright. Come out before I unload the rest of my clip. There you are cowboy. You don't need that gun. Let's settle this. Man to man. Yeah right. Thrown that knife over here. Do it! Now! (SCREAMING) Leave here be. Well, well. Why don't you come out and enjoy the party. Anna. I'm so disappointed in you. We could've had something special. What? How do you expect me to trust you now? You're insane! We could have taken your grandfather's business global. Money, cars, houses all over the world! We would have been so happy together. But no! Now you've taken it all away! Don't touch my granddaughter! Grandpa! (GUN SHOT) No! No! (CRYING) I told you I would carve you up. (GUN SHOT) Drop the knife Jennings. It's over. You shot my grandfather! Anna. I told him you would come after him, but he wouldn't listen. Drop the gun Anna. We got him. It's over. It's not over. It's only the beginning. (GUNSHOT) Anna. You do love me. Shut up Jennings. Anna. Why? I guess you say, it's in the blood. My grandfather began preparing me to take over his business at a young age. I have to admit, I caught on quick. Organization and attention to detail are vital. Perception is everyting. Jennings was nothing more than a useful idiot. I always knew your grandfather was a stupid man. Thinking a woman could run his business. You don't have the stomach to deal with the things I do. You might be on to something there. I guess I do have the stomach. Have a seat detective. You're still alive for a reason detective. I stopped by the station earlier today to discuss a deal with you. I dont make deals. Shh. Hear me out. You're too tense. Due to recent events, we have openings we need to fill in. I need a detective who's willing to look the other way, and maybe get a little hands on. You knew our mutual friend, detective Marks. What? It's unfortunate what happened. He was a good asset. That's where you come in. I'll give you the same percentage as Marks and Maybe with a few extra benefits. Not gonna happen. Come on! I'm the one taking all the risk. Besides. It's not a good day to be your partner. You and I both know, we'd make a great team. Okay. What about when the police arrive? That's the easy part. We tell them Jennings and his men came to rob me and my family, I managed to call you. You saved the day. You saved the innocent church girl. Sounds like someone deserves a medal to me. Sounds like you got it all figured out. Except for one thing. What's that? I'm sorry we couldn't come to an agreement. (GUNSHOT) (POLICE SIRENS) I'm glad I had this. Are you alright? Yeah. Looks like I woke up just in time. I never took you for the type to sleep on the job. Blow out your knee, and then you get shot. Then we'll talk. Marks, he was- Just forget it. I heard everything. You look like shit. Yeah, you don't look too good yourself. Come on. Well, here comes the calvary. Just a little late. I... Want to thank you for what you did back there. You know. Saving my life and everything. What? You would have done the same for me, right? Partner. Yeah. It's been one hell of a loaded Monday. (BLUES MUSIC PLAYING)
