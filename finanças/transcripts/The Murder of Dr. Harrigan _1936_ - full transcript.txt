Hey, Jace, come on. What's the matter, mister? Somebody hurt? Now run along sonny, be a good boy. Maybe it's a murder, isn't it, mister? There's gonna be one in a minute if you don't keep quiet. - Did you get it? - Yes. Okay, Roscoe. You should grow some whiskers, get a blue uniform and a bicycle. What do you mean? This messenger service you give these patients. Of course, I don't rate the attention. You're not as important as Mr. Melady. What did they sent you for? What's that? - A lachrymatory. - A lachrymatory? It's more like an acifidity bag. It's a tear vase. The old Romans used to cry into them. What's the matter? Didn't they have any handkerchiefs? - Don't, George. - Why not? Mr. Melady gave me definite instructions. He said it's not to be opened. It's priceless. He's right. It is. Hello. Evening Journal? What! Get me the Evening Journal! I want to talk to the editor. This is Peter Melady, of Melady Drug Corporation. Yeah. - They told me not to let you smoke. - Keep quiet. Hello, Harris. How are you? I've got an announcement that I consider of tremendous importance to the medical world. Now get it. I'm here in the hospital, I'm going to be operated on. And they're going to use my new anesthetic. Slaepan. Yes, it means sleep. Yeah. Now copy this down. Here's the detail. I couldn't live five minutes under ether. Slaepan can be used with the most delicate heart conditions. Yes. It paralyzes the entire nervous system. Yes. And the patient remains under its influence for three days. Right. And the pain and the after-effects of an operation are all through when the patient comes out of it. Did you get it? No, not too harsh. No, I was talking to the nurse. Yes, she's just brought the formula. Too many people after, so I'd better have it here with me. What? If it's hard to take? Why, no! It looks and tastes like water. You bet its credit is tremendous. Dr. Harrigan is going to operate. Tomorrow morning. Thanks, Harris. Do your best for that story. Good-bye. I said good-bye, miss Brody. I'm glad they're not all like you. You scare a girl to death! Dr. Coate said you are not to smoke because it's bad for your heart. Oh he did, did he? Well, it's my heart and I'll do what I like with it. Where's Dr. Harrigan? Why is he taking so long getting here? Father, don't shout like that. I could hear you across the hall. Well, there's nothing wrong with my lungs, anyway. How's the sunburn, miss Melady? I'm much better, thank you Sally. You would pick a time when I'm in the hospital to get broiled by the sun? A man can't even be alone in his own hospital. What's the matter with you? Why didn't you use Melady's Sun Freeze when you went to the beach? I forgot. Anyway, I don't like the smell of it. - Oh, you don't, don't you? - No, I don't. And if you don't stop shouting like that, your heart is gonna go pop just like that. - I was just telling it. - It's... Your heart and you'll do what you like with it. - Now see here... - No, father. But I don't want to be settled. I came here for a rest. Young lady, if you think... and you too... What is this, anyway? I came here for a rest, but so far my room has been the parade ground for your whole staff. I tell you I'm going to lose my temper. Then, something will happen. - Oh, Mr. Wentworth! - Will you get out of here? I refuse to have you constantly rolling me over and changing sheets under me. I know it's a deliberate effort to compromise me. - Mr. Wentworth! - Get out! Get out! Seems to me he wants us to get out. I wonder why Mr. Melady's daughter is hanging around here. Sunburn, isn't it? Oh, she could've gone home days ago. Maybe she has a reason for staying. - Good evening, Dr. Harrigan. - Good evening. Oh, doctor will you sign the order for 327's adrenaline? Let me have it. Thank you. Oh, I beg your pardon. Chart of the 307, please. You don't like Dr. Harrigan, do you? He's the sort of a man that makes me... I wouldn't know about that. I'm only interested in Dr. Harrigan professionally. I'm sure that would relieve his wife. Why don't you put it on the chart? 311 Looking for someone, Lillian? Yes, a doctor. Why don't you stick around? I'll have my shingle out in a month. Of course I realize you must have an operation. But why doctor Harrigan? Well, you finally got here. Hello, miss Melady. How's the sunburn? Hmm, well, it seems my daughter doesn't like you. You sent for me Melady? I gotta have an immediate operation and I want you to do it. You don't say. Yes, I don't like you any better than you like me, but if it's got to be done, you're the man I want. What's the matter with Dr. Coate? You are a better surgeon. You really think you could trust me to operate on you? Your professional integrity is what I trust. It's not ethical. You're Dr. Coate's patient. Oh, so you think I'm a pretty bad risk, eh? You'll think I'll discredit you, the great surgeon, by dying on the operating table. But I'm not going to die. I'm making it easy for you. We're not using ether. We're using Slaepan. Slaepan. Have you the permission of all the owners? I'm the owner of Slaepan. My claim is as good as yours. Not quite, Leo, because I have the formula. You and the others have nothing to do with it anymore. After cheating me out of my share in Slaepan? After all the work I did on that for you? Now you're asking me to help you publicize it. Exactly, my dear doctor. And don't forget this is the one advantage you have over the others who think they own Slaepan. What do you mean? I mean the fame that will come to you for being the first surgeon to employ it successfully. I could let my knife slip, you know. But you won't. Well, Simon, you seem to be doing all right. Do you like it any better here? Perhaps to do this sort of work , this place is as good as any, I guess. Oh, come on, cheer up, you'll soon be out on your own. I wonder. How're you, Dr. Lambert? Charity case? Yeah. Name is Sam Johnson. How did you like that lecture the other night? Oh, that man bores me. How'd you like it? Let me have the chart for 319, please. Thanks. Did you get that special? Yes, she's on her way. Dr. Harrigan is with Mr. Melady. Hadn't you better get the visitor out of Mrs. Harrigan's room before-- Thank, it's not a bad idea. Does his wife got her boyfriend with her? Foster, you sound like a house detective. Well, I like that. It's nice to know that someone appreciates me, even though I've had one wing clipped. Such a vision makes me wish my own arm was broken. - Good evening, Mrs. Harrigan. - Good evening. - Mr. Martin. - Good evening. Dr. Harrigan's in the hospital, Mrs. Harrigan. He's next door with Mr. Melady. How nice, miss Keating. - A cigarette? - No, thank you, Ken. If Mr. Martin will leave now, I'll make you comfortable for the night. Well, I've never been asked to leave any place quite so nicely. - I'd better be nice and go. - You'll do no such thing. Never mind, miss Keating, I'll call you when I want you. - Thank you. - Thank you. I tried to phone you at the club this afternoon. Where were you? I was working for a change. Really? Who is it? Agnes, I've got to see you. Oh, do we have to go over all that again? I can't help it. I'm so in love with you, I'm almost crazy. And these past few days seeing you here... My staying has nothing to do with you. I tell you it's no use. You're wasting your time. I know I'm nobody around here, but I will be if only... Oh, that's not the reason. I simply don't feel that way about you. And you must stop annoying me. I'll do as I promised I'll speak to father. Thank you, Agnes. If you can persuade him, things might be different. Now, please go. Oh, miss Keating, I want you to prepare Mr. Melady for surgery. I'm operating him at 8:00 in the morning. Yes, doctor. Oh, come on, only one more to bed down for the night. - Jackson? - Mm-hmm. Here's why we really go to work. # Ooh, the lady in red, she goes where she wants to go # # She goes better in red # # Ooh, the lady in red, she goes where she wants to go # # She goes where she wants to go # # Ooh, the lady in red... What a personality... # # Ooh, the lady in red, the boys are crazy about the lady in red. # # Ha-cha-cha. Ha-cha-cha. # That calls for another little drink. Ooh! Symptoms. Say, what are you fine nurses doing here? So that's where you've been hiding it. I wouldn't choose to know what you're talking about. Where did you get it? So help me, it was right in this bed when I came in about a week ago. Listen, nurse, I'm terribly stiff. I'm afraid that's an open secret. Listen, nurse, I won't get a way to sleep tonight unless I get an alcohol rub. I'll give you one. That'd be just too ducky. You know, nurse, I like you better than those other three nurses. They don't seem to understand my symptoms. Oh, goody-goody, what you got in that bottle there? - No, no, oh, no, nurse, nurse... - Please, still. No, I can't. No, I'm too ticklish, I have no willpower. I can't stand when anybody rubs me like that. If I can do it myself, I'm not so tickly. Yeah. You... uh, you don't need to wait. Will you be a good boy, turn out the lights and go right to sleep? Oh, there's nobody who doubt it, nobody who doubt it Trying to outsmart Jackson, ha! Over my dead body! - Going down, please. - Up, please. 4th floor please: appendixes, gall stones, tonsils, adenoids and goiters. 4th floor, please. Whatever goes up, comes down, mother used to say. George would you let me out of here instantly? Not until you give me my answer. - Will you let me out of here? -No. Really, I've work to do. That's just the point. You wouldn't have any, well, that is not much, if you were married to me. - Oh, what is it? - A break for Dr. Lambert. We've got to get this elevator starting. Have you made up your mind yet? I will if you let me out of here. The right way? You've proposed in elevators and ambulances, but I won't give you an answer until you pick the one place I consider most fitting for your actions. Swell, where's that? The psychopathic ward. You must, I tell you, he'll be murdered. It's impossible. I wish you shouldn't take such advantage of our friendship, please, please... What's the matter? Oh, you're not stepping, Dr. Coate? Well, if you call being at the dinner of the International Obstetrical Association stepping, then I have. Oh, I want 302 to have cold compresses every half-hour tonight. Yes, Doctor. How's Mr. Melady, miss Keating? About the same as usual. He's had his sodium amytal. He goes to surgery at 8:00 in the morning. What do you mean he goes to surgery? Why, those were Dr. Harrigan's orders, Doctor. Dr. Harrigan! But, what right has he to give orders about my patient? I'm sure I don't know, Doctor, except that Mr. Melady sent for Dr. Harrigan himself. I'll soon find out. I'll see Mr. Melady myself first thing in the morning. - Before 8:00 o'clock. - Yes, Doctor. What's this about your operating on Mr. Melady? Any objections? Well, since he's my patient, don't you think you might at least have consulted me? Possibly, Doctor, but it was at Mr. Melady's own request. As chief of staff here, let me tell you, Dr. Harrigan, I don't like some of the things you are doing. And, believe me, you are not going to operate on Mr. Melady. As you say, Doctor, you are the chief of staff. Send a stomach tube to 305. The patient just drank a bottle of rubbing alcohol. And you'd better have some help. Right. Thanks a lot, Sally. It's time to eat. Coming down? No, not right now. I'll be down later. See you down then. Miss Keating, is this the...? Will you please take that in and see that he drinks every drop of it? Yes, miss Keating. He'll drink anything, I guess. - Is there anything, Doctor, I can do? - No, thanks. Better run along to supper. Yes, Doctor. Well, darling, there was Steven and-- Oh, hello, Leo. Well, good evening, Doctor. You will, please, leave my wife's room. Oh, come, come, darling. This isn't at all becoming to you. Doctor Harrigan, are you inferring that--? If you don't go. I won't stop at inferences. Lillian, what are you doing here? I need the job, Leo. I haven't worked in a long time. You know I can't have you around here. I won't say anything, I won't even know you. Honestly, I-- You'll leave here tonight. - Good evening, Dr. Harrigan. - Good evening. Is this the room? - The end of the hall. This one. - Right. We can kid ourselves all we want to, but this job is not easy. Good evening. Oh, get out I don't want that medicine. - He don't want it. - That's a hot one. Hose! What are you gonna do with that hose? - These drunks get funny ideas. - Drunk? They think you had a couple of firewaters. I'm not drunk. I never touch liquor. I get it, you drink nothing but rubbing alcohol. - Take it away! - Take it easy now. Take it away! No! No! No! Help! Help! Boy, this guy's got a throat like a dumbwaiter shaft. He isn't in such a bad shape as Doc considered. Come in. You sent for me. Yes, when are you going to operate on my father? I'm taking him to the operating room now, But I thought it was to be tomorrow. So it was, but that would be too late. This is an emergency. Please, wait till tomorrow. I'd be only too glad to wait if I dared, miss Melady. Oh, I'm... I'm afraid I... Steady now. Don't worry about your father. Everything'll be all right. No, thanks, I'm all right. Now you get some rest and don't worry. I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it. You answer those calls. I can take care of Mr. Melady. - But, Doctor... - Do as I say. Yes, Doctor. As soon as miss Keating returns from supper, tell her to join me in surgery at once. Yes, Doctor, I will. You didn't eat much, Sally. Yes, you got a long way to go on a cup of coffee. Anything wrong, Sally? No, I'm all right. Somebody must be using it, but I don't hear it. The way some of these nurses eat, it's a wonder the elevator can lift them. Maybe that's what's wrong with it. Come on, slaves, climb. Let's wait for it. Why walk? Oh, come on, a few steps won't hurt you Oh, miss Keating, miss Keating, they'd come for the wrong patient. Where's Mr. Melady? Dr. Harrigan's just taking him up to surgery. To surgery? Yes, he said he had to operate at once and wants you to come right out. Don't you know enough not to leave this lying around in the patient's room? - Lock them up. - Oh, I'm sorry miss Keating, but they've pumped Mr. Wentworth in 307 by mistake and he's... Oh, dear! I'm trying but I'm only one person and I can't do everything at once. Are you sure that Dr. Harrigan took Mr. Melady up to surgery? Of course, I had to make up a stretcher. But why didn't you go up with him? Because the patients were signaling. Oh, dear they're at it again! I can't understand why you didn't send for me or an orderly. I don't know, miss Keating, but the patients... Oh, all right, answer them. That's just what I had in mind. - Who's this? - Charity ward negro. Died a little while ago. You'd better take him on the freight elevator, Simon. There's something the matter with this one. Maybe the door's stuck. Do the best you can with it. It's Keating, have you seen anything of Dr. Harrigan? No, I mean since then. What's wrong with the elevator? It won't work. Right. The door won't open unless the car is at the floor, you know. It's out of order, all right. Miss Cooper, have you seen Dr. Harrigan anywhere? Not lately. Is anything wrong? Uh... I don't know. Hello, this is Keating again. See if you can find Dr. Harrigan. On any of the other floors. Dr. Lambert! George! George! What's happened? The elevator! Dr. Harrigan! Take it easy. Get me Dr. Coate at once. Yes, Dr. Harrigan is dead. Sssh! Take her out of here quickly. - Take her out of here. - What happened? - I don't know. - Never mind, be quiet, easy. - It's terribly! - It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. Oh, my...! Sally, here, Sally, take her out. She's fainted. It's all right. Sshh, be quiet. Now it's all right. Let's go in there. I just wanted to see him, that's all. Yes, I know. I'll be back in a moment, doctor. - Don't let anybody get in here. - All right, Doctor. - Doctor Coate... - Have the police been notified? - Not yet, Doctor. - Well, you do so at once then, please. - Yes, Doctor. - What's all this excitement? I know this is... bad news. Bad news about Dr. Harrigan. I want you to control yourself. - What is it? - He's dead. He's been murdered. Oh, I see. Dr. Coate, please, miss Melady, We can't do anything, she's hysterical. I'll be right in. I suppose I should be getting hysterical too, doctor. As the bereaved wife, that's the usual procedure, isn't it doctor? I think you should go back to your room and not talk so much. The police will be here. Hello, this is Keating. Get Police Headquarters. Tell them there's been a murder at the Melady Memorial Hospital. Yes, a murder. Dr. Harrigan has been killed. What? Yes. Yes, that's right. Third floor. - Oh, George! - How about a drink? That'll quiet your nerves. That's the best suggestion you've ever made. Well, I'm progressing. Good publicity for a hospital: Murder. I know, but the corpse is a doctor, not a patient. Maybe his bedside manner annoyed somebody. Come on, sergeant, let's go. Well, a hospital isn't a bad place for a man to die in. That's right. Cheer up, Sally. No, thanks George. I've changed my mind. Oh, it's horrible! I just can't understand what could've happened to Mr. Melady. What? Isn't in his bed where he belongs? No, he just disappeared. Disappeared! George, aren't you going to have your drink? Huh? Oh, no, I think I'd better not. Come on. How are you, Dr. Coate? Have any trouble? Yes, doctor. Lieutenant, here's the coroner. Look him over, doc. And don't touch the knife. - Okay, lieutenant. - Who found the body? Uh... miss Keating here. Miss Keating, this is lieutenant Lamb. How do you do, lieutenant? Miss Keating, you didn't touch the body at all? No, lieutenant, but, Dr. Coate, there's something-- - What do you mean? - I... She means Melady... uh, Mr. Peter Melady is missing. - Missing? - I've looked everywhere. Melady phoned my paper early tonight that he was gonna be operated on by this Dr. Harrigan. They were gonna use that new drug, uh, Sleepan, Slaypen, uh... Slaepan. Slaepan, that's the drug. We'll come to that later. Sergeant, search every room in the building. But that will disturb my patients. We can't help that. If Melady is here, we've got to find him. Lock all the downstairs windows, put a man on every door. And no one is to leave the building without a special order from me. Right. Nelson, Jones, come this way. Now, you nurses go back to your posts - This place doesn't run itself. - Yes, doctor. Excuse me, lieutenant, I have to assure my patients that they're still in the hospital and not in a madhouse. Did any of the rest of you know that Mr. Melady was missing? - No, sir. - No, sir. No, we were all together. No one had any reason to miss him, lieutenant. You see, he was miss Keating's patient. And while she was looking for Mr. Melady, she found Dr. Harrigan. That sounds reasonable enough, but I got to-- - What happened? What's that? - Come on! What are you doing here? Oohh! How did I get in this police station? I thought this was a hospital. Didn't you drink a bottle of rubbing alcohol? That's what they think, but it wasn't rubbing alcohol. Who is he? He's 305, a harmless dipsomaniac. He looks like a plain drunk to me. You know, that's been my trouble. Symptom. - Take him back to his room. - I'll take this. I'm going to be very indignant about this. Dr. Coate, I'd like to get all the facts on this case. All right, let's go to my office. Miss Foster, please. Hey, Doc what else do you keep in there besides drugs? Help yourself. Girls, get at your posts. Jonsie, have this cleaned out. Yes, miss Foster. Desk, get this: that trick operation on Peter Melady by Dr. Harrigan scheduled for tomorrow morning has been postponed. A couple of fairly good reasons. Melady disappeared and someone stabbed the doctor to death. But I am giving you the story. The operation was postponed, wasn't it? Well, that's it. All right. Now listen, this is what we got so far. You're taking this pretty hard, aren't you? I can't help it. Well, don't worry about it. The police will find Melady and get the dope on how it happened. Anyway, it isn't your responsibility. But it is my responsibility. My entire career, my reputation as a nurse is in jeopardy. Mr. Melady is my patient. Is... or was? What do you mean? If you insist upon sticking your nose into this business, how do you know that Mr. Melady is still alive? I... I don't. Where is that thing he sent you for? - The lachrymatory? - Mm-hmm. He put it under his pillow. It's gone. George, what made you think of that just now? Oh, he told you it was priceless, didn't he? Well there's got to be a motive for everything that's happened here. Oh, I... I guess I must have the wrong room. I'm... I'm sorry. You still looking for a doctor, Lillian? Yes, a live one. You and Dr. Harrigan were not the best of friends, I take it. Would he have asked me to take his wife's case if we weren't friendly? I'll ask the questions, Dr. Coate. Mrs. Harrigan is here in the hospital? Yes, she's suffering from a comminuted fracture of the radius and the fracture of the ulna. All right, all right, she broke her arm. How? In an automobile accident. Dr. Harrigan was uninjured? Dr. Harrigan wasn't in the automobile. Mrs. Harrigan was alone? No, but the other occupant was uninjured. He was a Mr. Kenneth Martin. Here's the knife, lieutenant. Not a fingerprint on it. - Wiped clean. - Thanks, sergeant. This operating knife, Dr. Coate, it wouldn't require very much strength to kill a man with it. No, especially if the killer were acquainted with anatomy. I see. Dr. Coate, when you examined the body, was the handle of the knife smeared or clean? Do you expect me to notice trifles like that when one of my own staff is--? So are you insinuating that I--? Sorry to disturb you, brother, but orders is orders. I didn't order anything. You'd better get out of here or I'll call the police. What do you expect to find under my bed? Should I tell him? You better tell me. I'm a nervous man. What does it mean, anyway? Dr. Harrigan's been murdered and we have to search all the rooms. Only one doctor murdered? Ha, ha! If I had my way, I'd murder everybody in the hospital. I came here for a rest, but so far it's been like a convention of idiots. Oh, take it easy, my friend. You might catch yourself a temperature. A parade of doctors, nurses, plumbers and now the police! I've had enough! What are you gonna do? I'm going to get out here before I become a maniac too. Another dipsomaniac! No one's allowed to leave the hospital, and orders is orders! What? Take a powder. And I'm a sick man... Momma, momma...! Say, nurse, how do we get in there? What do you want in there? We're looking for a man. Well, if he's over two weeks old, he wouldn't be in there. Then you saw or heard nothing unusual before Dr. Harrigan's body was discovered. No, I... I don't think so. Let me see, uh... oh, yes. Sally Keating usually goes to supper with me, but tonight she stayed on duty. Well, why not? Evidently, her presence was required. That's all, miss Foster. Yes, I... I'm sorry, I can't seem to think of anything else. Okay and thanks. - Send miss Cooper in. - Yes, sir. Miss Cooper. Oh, we didn't learn very much there, doctor. We'd have to do better than that. Sit down, please. Miss Cooper, before the discovery of the murder tonight, did you hear or see anything out of the usual hospital routine? Please, answer the lieutenant, miss Cooper. Well, yes I did. But it doesn't seem fair to mention it because it was only snatches of conversation as I was passing Agnes Melady's room. It's your duty to tell all your know, miss Cooper. I heard miss Melady say "you must, he'll be murdered". And then miss Keating said something like "it's impossible, you shouldn't ask me to do that". That's all I heard. Have you any idea of the subject of the conversation? I suppose they were talking about the operation that Dr. Harrigan was going to perform on Mr. Melady, but I completely forgot about it until just now. And I'm sure that Sally had nothing to do with it. - With what? - With the murder, of course. Of course, she didn't. I'm glad you're both so sure. That's all, miss Cooper. It seems someone went looking for a doctor and found him. Were you able to help them, Lillian? I think I could, if I wanted to. I think you could at that. You have a peculiar sense of humor, doctor. Did they find out anything? Sorry miss, but you're not supposed to talk. Don't worry, I'm not going to. Were you serious, doctor? Do you think she knows anything about all this? I don't know I'm sure, Simon. It might have been you, or Margaret, or Sally, or even Agnes. Do you feel guilty, sergeant? - Now my theory is-- - Suppose you save it for the lieutenant. Miss Keating, will you step inside, please? Yes, doctor. Uh, Dr. Lambert, will you be good enough to see if miss Melady is able to talk to us now? Certainly. Miss Melady, you'd better come downstairs. My father, have they found him? You'd better come downstairs. What is it? Why don't you tell me? Please, try and calm yourself, miss Melady. Have you found my father? No, miss Melady, we're still searching. Well, you must find him. Don't you understand? You must! Please, miss Melady, calm yourself. You may be able to help us. Miss Melady, what were you so anxious to have miss Keating get for you earlier this evening? How did he know? Will you please answer my question? I asked Sally to get the Slaepan from the drug room. I was afraid for Dr. Harrigan to operate on my father, so I tried to prevent him. Why? My father and Dr. Harrigan were bitter enemies. And yet Mr. Melady was willing? I understand he even asked for Dr. Harrigan to operate on him. Well, father trusted him professionally, but I didn't. Dr. Harrigan and others claimed they had part ownership in Slaepan. They'd been working on the formula. But father was the only one who had the entire formula. Who are the others have worked on it? I... I don't know. Where's the formula now? I have it. Why don't you let the lieutenant keep it for you? It belongs to my father. I'd rather keep it and give it to him myself. Why did you ask miss Keating to get the Slaepan? I mean, why did you single her out? We were old friends. We went to school together. And did she get it for you? - Why? - Yes, I did. I brought the Slaepan to miss Melady. Miss Keating, this is a flagrant breach of discipline. I can't stand for such things. Will you please, leave the hospital? Hold on that, doctor. You can't fire anyone yet. Miss Keating gave you the Slaepan? - Yes. - Well, where is it now? I... I poured it down the basin. Oh, I made it for Dr. Harrigan. I wanted to stop him at any cost, but I lost my nerves. Now, lieutenant, I think we'd better let her rest. Take her back to her room. Send in Dr. Simon. Please, let me know as soon as you hear anything. Certainly we will. Well, you just try to get some rest and don't worry. Now, if she can only get some sleep. She'll drop off in a moment. As for you, you certainly put yourself in a fine spot stealing that stuff in the drug room. Suppose she had given the drug to Dr. Harrigan. Well, if she had, all this probably wouldn't have happened. You can see her point. She wanted to save her father. But you should have kept out of it. Oh, Sally, why don't you promise to go straight and marry me? - George! - What is it? I wonder if she was telling the truth. Maybe she did give him the Slaepan. Any news of Mr. Melady? - No, sir, we searched everywhere. - Even the maternity ward. Every place but the morgue. I guess you've covered everything. Yes, sir, from the cradle to the grave. George... What is it? Now, here's Dr. Harrigan's order for me to join him in surgery. You know, if I hadn't known Dr. Harrigan, I could have sworn... Sally, look at this writing. Come on. Then what happened? When we found the elevator wasn't working, miss Cooper went to phone about it and I took the stretcher to the freight elevator, as miss Keating had suggested, and delivered the body of the dead Negro to receiving on the first floor. Checked it through the usual routine, then went down and had my supper. We didn't learn much from that, did we lieutenant? If you think of anything else, doctor, let us know, will you? Yes, sir, I will. Just a minute. Answer me one question. Is it usual to go from the morgue to the dinner table? It is around here. It's all in the day's work, lieutenant. Every man to his taste, I always say. Send the other one in. What's her name? Miss Brody. She's a student nurse and she had the third floor while the others were at supper. She's here. I had nothing to do with this, I'm sure. Miss Brody, during the time the others were at supper, did anything occur to your knowledge that you think might bear on this case? What case? The murder of Dr. Harrigan. You are aware that he was killed, aren't you? Oh, yes, sir. But when you said case, I thought you meant hospital case and I've been attending to so many-- No, miss Brody, please, not your biography, just answer the lieutenant's question. Yes, doctor. Did anything occur? Now, let me think. Do your best. Maybe if you sat down. Thank you. 305 drank rubbing alcohol and 307 was pumped by mistake. 307 was very angry and so weak from the pumping that I'm sure he couldn't have done it. No, I guess I don't know anything. Dr. Harrigan went into his wife's room and I heard them and her boyfriend sort of telling each other where to get off. And then later Sally sneaked the boyfriend up to the fourth floor before she went to supper. What's that? Speak up! Sally took Mr. Martin, or whatever his name is, up to the 4th floor. What's so terrible about that? That was before you helped Dr. Harrigan to the elevator with Mr. Melady? - Yes. - Did Sally come right down? I don't know. I didn't see her till she returned from supper. Did you distinctly hear any of the words that passed between Dr. Harrigan and this man Martin? Oh, let me see. They were arguing very angrily about something... I know: inferences. Inferences? Dr. Harrigan told Mr. Martin that if he didn't go, he wouldn't stop at inferences. Maybe it's the name of a hotel. Maybe I'm not beginning to see daylight too. Come on, doctor. Oh, what am I supposed to do? Stop at inferences! Sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Harrigan, but the lieutenant wants-- Come right in. How delightful of you to have chosen this hospital for the policemen's annual picnic. Mrs. Harrigan, what time did your... caller Mr. Martin leave here tonight? I really don't remember. You see, one rather loses track of time in a hospital. Quite so. However, you do recall that Dr. Harrigan threatened him when he discovered him in your room, don't you? Dr. Harrigan was a very jealous man, but if all his threats were laid out end to end, they wouldn't have amounted to that. Perhaps you're right. Mr. Martin left this room accompanied by the nurse miss Keating? Well, you really know everything. Yes, miss Keating was going to show him out. It was past visiting hours, you see. However, that doesn't seem to have kept people from getting in. Thank you very much, Mrs. Harrigan. I'm here on a mission of friendship. What? I... I don't know you. But look at me, I'm your neighbor. I'm in the next cell. Why, you're insane. Nevertheless, I came for the top of my pajamas and a little drink. I don't drink and I don't wear pajamas. You deny that you swiped the upper story of my sleeping garments? I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, come on, give me a little drink and we'll forget the whole matter. Come on now, be a good friend. Oh, no, you don't. I'm disappointed in you. As Napoleon said at Valley Forge, if you don't give me the coat of my pajamas and a drink, I'm gonna take them by force. Help! Help! Help! Thief! Vandal! - Help! - What's all this racket about? He just stole the top of my pajamas. - Oh, he did? - And you can't do business that way. Either he gives me the coat and I give him the pants or I'll dissolve the partnership. And I'm in no mood to dilly-dally. He's telling an untruth. I wear a nice shirt. It should be a straitjacket. Now, Mr. Wentworth, just try and rest. Hey, which one of these guys is nuts? Oh, I wish you hadn't have asked me that. I should go to my room, I can't stand all these disturbances. The whole world has gone mad. Hey you, move over. You know, some of these drunks get the funniest ideas. Now look at me. I'm calm and peaceful. Will you take my temperature? Drink all that, please, Mr. Wentworth. Go on, take it, take it all. And I took Mr. Martin to the 4th floor so that he could leave the hospital unobserved by way of the fire escape. You actually saw him go downstairs? I saw him go out the door. - You locked the door? - It locks itself. Now, miss Keating, why did you think it's so necessary that Mr. Martin should have to leave the hospital unobserved? I was afraid if Dr. Harrigan saw him again, it might've upset him. He had a very delicate operation to perform in the morning. You have the interest of the hospital very much on your mind, haven't you? I tried to do what's required of me. Look here, lieutenant. You don't think that miss Keating-- Doctor Lambert, please, don't interfere. The medical examiner wants to see you, lieutenant. Send him in. All right, doctor. I performed an autopsy on Dr. Harrigan here in the hospital. What did you find? Dr. Harrigan was drugged at the time he was stabbed. He was probably unconscious. What was the drug? I can't determine exactly. I'll let you know later. - Is that all? - Is that all? Isn't that enough? Enough? It's great! Sergeant, have the department check on Kenneth Martin. I want him here as soon as he can be found. All right, sir. Twice in one night you violated hospital discipline. I can't understand it. I think I can. Miss Keating, isn't it quite likely that you drugged Dr. Harrigan with the Slaepan you stole from the drug room? No, no. Then you took Mr. Martin up to the 4th floor where he killed the helpless doctor with this knife. No, please, no. Isn't it also likely that you wiped the knife clean of all fingerprints after Martin had departed down the fire escape? No, it's not true. Maybe Mr. Martin fascinated you too. Just a minute, lieutenant. Miss Keating happens to be engaged to me. - Is that true? - Yes. That doesn't alter the case. Maybe Martin and miss Keating weren't working together, but Agnes Melady prevailed upon her to administer the drug. When Martin saw his opportunity, he took advantage of it, for the obvious reason that he was in love with the doctor's wife. You're just guessing, lieutenant. You have no evidence against miss Keating and you shouldn't jump to conclusions. That's my solution. Two and two make four and miss Keating stays here in the hospital until they bring Mr. Martin. Who is the fourth part of your solution, which up to now has been a three parts theory? You put Martin into it and if he won't mix, according to your formula, the whole thing blows up and you start all over again. I'd better hurry up and get married before my bride is arrested for murder. Sometimes I could kill you. Sshhh! Someone may be listening and have you marked down as a habitual murderess. What are we going to do? Tell me again how many times you rang for the elevator. Four times in all. Once on the first floor, and then on the third floor, And then on the fourth floor again after you found the operating room empty. Isn't that correct? Yes, and then on the third floor again. Simon was there with the dead Negro on the stretcher. Then Lillian came and Simon tried to force the doors. Are you sure there was a Negro on the stretcher? Yes, I looked. Why? Dr. Harrigan was in the elevator. Dead. All the time you were running up and down those stairs. But the emergency switch was off. Don't you remember when I took you to an elevator ride I threw the switch off? Anybody could have rung for it and wouldn't have come. I'd like to know who turned the switch on again. Oh, it couldn't have been Martin. It could have been Dr. Coate, Mrs. Harrigan, Simon, miss Melady or... or Lillian. Or might have been me, as the lieutenant thinks. Nonsense. That Lillian's been snooping around here ever since she came a few days ago. I wonder who she is. I don't know. No! No! No! Where does yelling come from? Lillian, what's the matter? What's happened? Who was it? I was coming upstairs. Someone jumped off me from the floor above and tried to choke me. Didn't you see who it was? No, it was... it was too dark. Oh, she's fainted. Let's get her upstairs. Miss Keating, see that she's made comfortable for the night. Now have a guard placed to the door, sergeant. What's is it? What's happened? Bertha, you come with us. We were downstairs. Where could miss Keating and Lambert have come from? - Most likely from this floor. - Hello. Otherwise we will have met them. For you, lieutenant. Wood's reporting. Lamb speaking. Yes, Woods. Checked out, hey? Broadcast his description by teletype. Cover all depots and bus stations. Okay. Martin checked out of his hotel, probably tried to skip town. We'll get him. When we do, we'll have the answer to all this. Has that changed your mind? No, the nurse may have faked the whole attack. She implicated miss Keating and may be sorry for it now. What about Melady? We'll find that out when they have Martin here in handcuffs. If you find him. There's nothing in the morgue room. Nothing except the body of Sam Johnson. That doesn't help us any. He's not in there. You must be colorblind. Are you sure you saw that Negro's face? Oh, yes, George. I told you I lifted the sheet. You know, you're accused of this murder and we've gotta do something to get you out of it. Simon, what happened to the Negro that died early tonight? He's not in there. Yes, I know. They took him down to the City Morgue right away. Would you like to see the card? No. Let's go outside and get some air. Looks like the air is going to be limited. Probably lieutenant's network. You know, the solution is so near and yet I can't seem to be able to reach it. It's like having a name on the tip of your tongue and not being able to say it. It's all connected up with the Slaepan drug. The dead colored man. The disappearance of Mr. Melady. That fellow seems to be in an awful hurry. I wonder if... Let's have a look. Come on. George you might stay a little closer to me. What, dear? Look, George, look! - What is it? - A flashlight, still burning. Someone must've been here within the hour or so. Must have left hurriedly. Look! My hunch is right. Is this what you saw on the stretcher? Oh, yes that's the body of the dead Negro, Sam Johnson. - You're sure? - Why, of course I'm sure. All right, come on. Where are we going? First to make a phone call, then we'll go for a ride. Come on. Boys, a million cops around. What's all the excitement upstairs? I don't know. I heard one of the MD'S got cut up. Form reversal, huh? "Man bites dog." Ambulance. What's that? Alive? Yeah, yeah, right away. Yeah, sure. - What's the matter? - Nurse Sally, down the morgue. Said that guy we brought in is still alive. What? Yes, said to come and get him right away. Say, you mean to say that stiff we took down there is still alive? Yes. What's she trying to do? Make a couple of chumps out of us? Oh, Mike, let's get the guy out there before he dies all over again. Boy, of all the funny things I've seen, this one sure takes the cake. - Hey, where are you going? - The morgue. - I gotta go with you. - Okay. Okay. We're gonna get a lot of trouble for this with that policeman up front. You're in a lot of trouble right now. I'd bet this ride can get you out of it. Well, if it doesn't, you'll be in this as deep as I am. Well, I had to do something to get out of that madhouse. And the phone call did it. Just what do you expect to find at the morgue? What do you generally find at the morgue? A lot of your patients. - Here we are, the morgue. - The last stop. Hey, you still don't think somebody was ribbing us? Let's get these doors open and get ready for action. You can't tell if that phone call might have been on the level. Boys, before you say a word, it was the only way I could do it. Hey, wait a minute! - Kidding a cop, eh? - Oh, so this was your idea. Say Herbert, what do you think of this horrible hatchet murder? I never read them gruesome things. Makes my blood run cold. Herbert, did you get a case from the Melady Memorial tonight? Yeah, it came in a little while ago. Tag read... uh... Sam Johnson. Accident case. Let's see him. Let me think now. Where did I put him? Oh, he's right there. Oh, it's Mr. Melady! Somebody switched Sam Johnson's ticket. Hey, you two, what's this all about? It's Peter Melady. Can you beat that? Are you sure? Positive. Herbert, how soon can we have an autopsy? Well, I'll... see the doctor. Here it is, lieutenant. He was trying to blow town. Bring miss Keating here right away. Yes, sir. Tried to skip town, eh? I'd like to know the meaning of this outrage. Humiliated like this. I can oblige you. You're charged with the murder of Dr. Harrigan. Well, that's preposterous. All murders are preposterous, particularly to the accused. What time did you leave Mrs. Harrigan's room tonight? I don't remember. All the old familiar phrases, eh? Well, how did you leave the hospital? On my two feet and out the front door. Not out the fourth floor fire escape? No. Miss Keating accompanied you to the fourth floor. She tells us so herself. She also says she opened the fire escape door for you. Well, it was after visiting hours and I wanted to get out without being seen. Because you killed Dr. Harrigan. I thought that whoever investigated the case would think that. That's why I tried to leave town. Oh, you knew all the time that he was dead, did you? Not until I read the early morning extras. Nice alibi those early morning extras. - Lieutenant... - Yeah. Miss Keating isn't in the hospital. What? She's gone and so is Dr. Lambert, Didn't I give orders that no one was to leave the without a special order for me? Who let them out? Where did they go? I don't know, sir. Get busy and find out who's responsible for this. Yes, sir. What's the matter with you, flat heads? Letting two people walk right out under your noses. When I find out which one slipped up on this, I'll have his shield. Now get out of here and get back on your posts. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Everything's all right, lieutenant. - Where have you been? The morgue. Are you responsible for this? I couldn't help it, sir. They hid in the ambulance on its way out. I was with them, only I didn't know it. Oh, you didn't know it, eh? We found Peter Melady. - Where? - In the morgue. Dead. He was tagged with the name of a Negro who died in this hospital. How did Melady die? Well, from the look on his face, he was frightened to death. No violence. - That's right, sir. - They performed an autopsy. I guess that cancels all charges against miss Keating here and Mr. Martin. Oh, yes? Well, maybe they switched the bodies. Until it's proved otherwise, I'll hold them as active accessories. I never let one suspect go until I get another one. You haven't a case against me. We'll let the Court decide that. Sergeant, take miss Keating to her room. Let her get whatever she wants. This case is just about washed up. Please, come quickly, it's miss Melady's room. - What is it? - Well, you'd better come. We stay here. Sit down. What happened? Agnes, are you all right? Oh, someone tried to steal the formula! Look, they broke in the chain. Oh, I'm afraid! Lieutenant, these commotions have got to stop. My patients... How about my patience? Who was it? I don't know. - You sure you didn't dream it? - Of course, I didn't. Sounds like it to me. You fell out of bed, pulled the necklace and broke it yourself. Come on, miss Keating. The rest of you clear out of here. Come on. Oh, Sally, must you go? I'd feel safe if you were here. I'll only be a moment. The lieutenant wants to see me. Oh, keep this. Come on, clear this room. And lock it up somewhere. George, you'd better take this. Get your things, miss Keating. You're under arrest, you know. You're making the mistake of your life, lieutenant. Two and two still make four, my friend. I know, but you're blasting the lives of two innocent people. While we're waiting for miss Keating, suppose you tell me what happened and who did it. - I can tell you what happened - Sure. All right. In the first place, miss Keating let Martin out the fire escape and then went down to supper. - Just like that. - Exactly. Dr. Harrigan was determined to operate on Peter Melady immediately. When Agnes heard about it, she sent for him. Check. Dr. Harrigan was an inveterate water drinker. Agnes had the Slaepan that miss Keating brought to her. It's tasteless and looks like water. Dr. Harrigan drank it. - You mean that Agnes-- - I'm afraid so. Go on. Dr. Harrigan wheeled Melady out of his room on the third floor, after administering the usual morphine. Margaret helped him to the elevator and then she went about her duties. - Right? - You are telling it. We don't know Dr. Harrigan's motive, whether he intended to operate on Melady or if he intended to kill him and steal the formula. And by this time it doesn't matter, because the Slaepan was beginning to drug him and the actual murderer appeared on the scene. - From where? - I don't know. Possibly from the elevator or the stairs. And he was-- Dr. Harrigan told this man, let's call him Mr. "A", to take Melady to surgery on the fourth floor. Now, bear this mind, lieutenant. Dr. Harrigan never got to surgery, he never left the third floor. He stayed to write a note on Melady's chart for miss Keating to join him in surgery. Here's the note. Look at the writing, lieutenant. Looks strung, doesn't it? Sure does. Go on. You remember, lieutenant, a lot of people thought they were being cheated out of a share in Slaepan. Now this Mr. A, who wheeled the stretcher into the elevator and took it to the fourth floor, was one of those. For the moment he had Melady, who was helpless, but still conscious, alone. He thought it was his opportunity. He went to the case of operating knives, opened the case, selected one of the knives and walked back to the stretcher where Melady laid helpless. And with this knife threatened Melady's life. But instead of finding out where the formula was, he frightened the old man to death. Martin could have been the man with the knife. No, lieutenant, this is my story. And by that time, Martin was on his way back to his hotel. Okay. My Mr. A lost his head. Instead of leaving Melady on the stretcher, he dragged the body across the floor, hoping to give the impression that Melady, frightened at the prospect of the operation, died while attempting to escape the operating room. He got the body into the elevator. Then realized that Harrigan might arrive from downstairs any second. He closed the elevator doors just as Harrigan, now almost completely doped by the drug, but nevertheless managing to keep his feet, summoned the elevator from the third floor. The elevator came down from the fourth floor but the frightened Mr. A had switched off the light. Even in the dimly lit elevator, Harrigan, with the last glimmering of consciousness, sees the dead Melady and the menacing figure with the operating knife. The murderer plunges the knife into his heart and stands watching Harrigan, as he sinks down into the corner of the elevator. Dead. The murderer searches Harrigan for the formula, but cannot find it. Sure is right. I don't know whether you're a good doctor. Now I have my doubts about you being a good detective, but you sure know how to tell a story. Lieutenant, this is not a story. This is fact. So far it sounds great. Go ahead and finish it. Now I want you to follow me closely. This may seem a bit complicated. I am listening. The nurses return from supper and ring for the elevator, but they can't get it, as the murderer has switched off the current. While miss Keating is ringing the bell, Simon appears wheeling the body of the dead Negro. Then miss Cooper arrives on the scene. Miss Keating suggests that Simon take the body of the dead Negro down the freight elevator. Then goes upstairs again and continues to search for Melady. Miss Cooper reports that the elevator is out of order. Simon delivered the body of the dead Negro to the receiving room and then goes into supper. Now, in some way the murderer substitutes the body of the dead Negro for that of Melady and sends Melady's body to the city morgue with the dead Negro's tag on it. It is my guess, lieutenant, that the murderer intended to dispose of Dr. Harrigan's body along with that of the Negro's, but there wasn't time. And before he got hauled off the elevator, Miss Keating's effort was successful. The elevator arrives at the fourth floor and she rides down with the body. Is that clear? It fits all right, but it still could be Martin. He could have gone up the fire escape while miss Keating was coming down on the elevator. Martin hasn't been here all night. And somebody is still after the formula. - Dr. Coate. - Miss Keating. I want you to give me the Slaepan formula for safekeeping. No, doctor. As the head of the hospital, I demand that you give it to me. Miss Melady entrusted it to me, please. I... Oh, very well. But I think it would be safer with me. Stop it! George! George! George! George! You head up off downstairs, you go to the roof. Then what happened? When I saw that Melady was dead, I knew that Harrigan would accuse me of the murder to get me out of the way, so he could claim full rights of Slaepan. It was his life or mine. As I started down the elevator with... without his body, I became desperate. I stopped the car on the third floor and, as Harrigan stumbled in, I killed him. What claim did you have to the formula? What claim did I have to it? I worked on it night and day in that laboratory. I was the human guinea pig. Each new stage of the drug was tried out on me. For days at that time I was under its influence. Then, when it was perfected and my knowledge was no longer needed, I was kicked out and sent up here as just another intern, while Melady and Harrigan fought over the ownership. But it's mine, I tell you, it's mine! It's mine and if I can't have it, nobody-- When did you wipe the handle of the knife clean? I didn't. Who was in on it with you? I wiped off the knife. You did? When? During the excitement, just after they found the body. I went into the elevator. I knew that Simon had killed him and I wanted to help him get away with it. How did you know? As I came up from supper, I surprised Simon. I saw that he'd killed him and I was glad. Glad, do you hear? Why? Because I knew Leo Harrigan better than anybody in the world. Yes, better than you did. Because I was married to him first. - You were? - Married to him? Until he kicked me out, for her and her money. You didn't know that, did you? I was good enough for him when he was just an intern. Not when he became the famous society doctor. He even tried to keep me out of the only work that I knew: Nursing. So that I wouldn't be around to remind him how rotten he was. Who attacked you on the stairs? Oh, Simon. He tried to make me steal the formula from Agnes Melady before he made his getaway. And when I refused, he thought I was going to expose him. You'd better keep this troublesome trinket until the law finds out to whom it belongs. Well, doctor, I really don't know how to thank you for your assistance. Forget it. Forgive me, Dr. Coate, but when you asked me for the formula, I was afraid that you-- So was I. About you. Both you and the lieutenant. I hope you'll forget what I said about your leaving the hospital. It's quite all right, doctor. I'm going anyway. What? Yes, she's putting herself in the hands of a good doctor. Nothing serious. Just a little heart trouble. Transcription and subtitle made by gamboler[noirestyle]
