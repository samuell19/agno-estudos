It seems like it's something you might wanna, you know, mention. "Mom and Dad, my black boyfriend" "will be coming up this weekend" "and I just don't want you to be shocked" "that he's a black man." You said I was the first black guy you ever dated. Yeah, so what? Yeah, s0 this is uncharted territory for them. You know, I don't wanna get chased off the lawn with a shotgun. You're not going to. First of all, my dad would've voted for Obama a third time if he couldfire. Like, the love is so real. I'm only telling you that 'cause he's definitely gonna wanna talk to you about that. And it will definitely fucking suck. But that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else. They are not racist. All right. I would've told you. Iwouldn't be bringing you home to them.

He wasn't driving. I didn't ask who was driving. I asked to see his ID. Yeah, why? That doesn't make any sense. HGFG. No, no, no. Fuck that. You don't have to give him your ID 'cause you haven't done anything wrong. Baby' baby, it's okay. Come on. Any time there is an incident, we have every right to ask... That's bullshit. Ma'am...

Your father gets really excited, but... Anyway, yeah. I'm Missy. Yes. Come on in. Please, welcome. Inside. So how was your drive in? It was fine. We actually hit a deer. What'? Oh, no. Is it dead? Yeah. That's horrible. Are you guys all right? Yeah. It just fruck us out. It did? Yeah. It came outta nowhere. We got it pretty good. Yeah, it must have frucked you out, big time. Frucking weird. Well, you know what I say? I say one down, a couple hundred thousand to go. Dean. Dad. No, I don't mean to get on my high horse, but I'm telling ya, I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it. They're taking over. They're like rats. They're destroying the ecosystem. I see a dead deer on the side of the road, I think t0 myself, "That's a start." I don't even understand that. I'm sorry. I'm just sayin'. You know what, lam grateful for what you've done today. I don't like 'em. We got that. Okay. Yeah. All right, you guys look so wiped out. Yeah, a little. Yeah. So how long has this been going on? This... This thang? How long? Four months. Four months? Mmm. Five months, actually. She's right, I'm wrong. Attaboy. Better get used to saying that. Please, I'm so sorry. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. She's right, I'm wrong. See'? Does he have an off button? This is exhausting. I know. I wanna give you a tour. They just got... Can we unpack first? You wanna unpack? Before the tour? This is Missy's office. She takes appointments in there. She's a therapist, right? Psychiatrist, yeah. Turns out people up here are just as messed up in the head as they are in the city. This is Jeremy. That's Rose's little brother. There he is. I've heard stories. Yeah, I bet you have. He's studying medicine now. Wants to be just like his old man. You'll meet him. All right. Cool. I picked these up in Bali. It's pretty eclectic. I'm a traveler and I can't help it. I keep bringing souvenirs back. It's such a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture. You know what I'm saying? Mmm-hmm. Oh, you're gonna love this. My dads claim to fame. He was beat by Jesse Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Those are the ones where... Owens won in front of Hitler. Yeah, what a moment. What a moment. I mean, Hitler's up there with all his perfect Aryan race bullshit. This black dude comes along, proves him wrong in front of the entire world. Amazing. Tough break for your dad though. Yeah. He almost got over it. That's the basement. We had to seal it up. We got some black mold down there. My mother loved her kitchen, so we keep a piece of her in here. Georgina, this is Chris. This is Roses boyfriend. Hi. Hello. The garbage goes under the sink, and new {or me pi?ce de r?sistance, the field of play. I love it. The nearest house is across the lake. It's total privacy. I know what you're thinking. What? Come on, I get it. White family, black servants. It's a total clich?. I wasn't gonna take it there. Well, you didn't have to. Believe me' No. We hired Georgina and Walter to help care for my parents. When they died, I couldn't bear to let them go. I mean... But, boy, I hate the way Hlooks. Yeah' I know what you mean. By the way, I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could. Best president in my lifetime. Hands down. I agree. Yeah. So what do your parents do, Chris? Uh... My dad wasn't really in the picture. My mom passed away when I was 11. Oh, I'm sorry. How did she die? A hit and run. DEAN; That's awful. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. You were young. Actually, I don't remember a lot from that time, so... Well, that's okay. We don't have to talk about that. You smoke, Chris? Mmm-hmm. You jonesing a little bit over there, huh'? I'm quitting. Dad, this is why I don't bring people to the house anymore. That's okay. We're notjudging. We're not. That's a nasty habit, though. You should have Missy take care of that for you. How? Hypnosis. She developed a method, and I'm telling you, it works like a charm. Wow, um... Some people don't want strangers messing around in their heads, guys. Listen, Chris, I thought it was total bullshit. I smoked cigarettes for 15 years. I loved every goddamn puff I took. She puts me under once... The sight of a cigarette makes me want to vomit. Okay, fall back, Dean. It's a service we provide. I'm good, actually. Yes. Thank you, though. Well, smoker or not, we're thrilled to have you up here for the big get-together. Yeah. Wait, holy shit. That's this weekend? Yes, this weekend. What get-together? Oh, my God. Thanks, George. It's Rose's grandfather's party. My dad would throw a shindig once a year. Get all his friends together, bocce ball, badminton... Wait, why didn't you guys tell me about this? Well, it's the same day every year, sweetheart. No, it's not. MISSY: Um... It is. Actually, it is. Is it really? - Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong. - Yeah. We just kept it up because after they died, it felt like... We keep them close to us. Yeah, they're still with us. I just wanted to have a chill weekend. Sounds like fun, actually. Oh, Georgina. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Why don't you go lay down? Just get some rest. Yes, I think I will. Good. My God, it must be very... 'Sup, fam! Hey, Jar-Bear. Hi, darling. Hey, buddy. Nobody answers the door around here? Hey, Rosie. Why would I lie, huh? I love it! Did she tell you about her toenail collection? What? Oh, my God! She used to bite 'em off, suck on 'em, and save 'em in a jewelry box. No, I didn't. I don't know what you're talking about. That is so disgusting. I fucking hate you. Okay, here's a good one. Uh, let rne set the scene. It was our junior year. Rose has a crush on this guy, Conner Garfield. Conner Garfield. No. Mom? No, Jeremy, stop. No, no, these are good. I want to hear them. Yeah, Rose, where are your manners? Our guest wants to hear the stories, please. JEREMY; Thank you. So Connefls from my lacrosse team, right? Huge kid, like 6'3". And he's pretty dumb, right? So we threw this party. You threw a party. I think my parents were in Greece or something. We raided their liquor cabinet and we're all shit-faced. Like 15 of us. Oh, my God. Tell me this isn't true, Rose. Yeah. I filled the liquor bottles with water... And let me finish? Uh-huh. Go ahead. I'm curious. So I'm upstairs hooking up with the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely. Oh, God. You realize you're coming off as, like, the world's biggest douchebag, right? So Conner starts banging on the bathroom door, right? I open it and bloocfs gushing from his mouth. And he's screaming, "Your sister bit my fucking tongue off!" You bit him? MISSY: What? Okay, to be fair, it was my first kiss and he slipped some tongue and I was not expecting it. It was a reflex. I'm sorry. A reflex that I have since gotten rid of. Yeah. DEAN: Yeah, you better be careful. Yeah, I'm very careful now. I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean, maybe clean it up just a little bit? So, Chris, what's your sport? Football? Baseball? Basketball, mostly, I guess. You an MMA fan? Dude. "Dude" what? What? Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone else have the floor for a second? You're dating my sister, right? He's dating my sister. You had your chance. I can't get to know the guy? You mean like UFO? Yes. Nah, too brutal for me. You ever get into street fights as a kid? I did judo after school, first grade. Aw... You shoulrfve seen me. Judo? 'Cause with your frame and your genetic makeup, if you really pushed your body, and I mean really train, you know? No pussyfooting around. You'd be a fucking beast. Carrot cake! Ooh! Hi. Carrot cake. What did I miss? A whole bunch of nothing. Just talking about sports. Right? Yeah. That sounds good. So the thing aboutjiu-jitsu is strength doesn't matter, right? It's all about this. It's a strategic game like chess. It's all about being two, three, four moves ahead. Cool. Stand up. Jeremy, no karate at the dinner table. It's not karate, Ma. Yo, I got a rule. No play-fighting with drunk dudes. I don't play, I'm just... Jeremy. I wasn't gonna hurt him. He was gonna put you in a fucking headlock. What is his problem? He has never treated any of my boyfriends that way. Ever, ever, ever. Mmm-hmm. Oh, my God. And then my dad with the "my man" stuff. "My man, my man." I don't think he's ever heard that or said it. And now he just... It's all he says. Yup. Oh, and my mom being rude to Georgina? What the fuck was that about? That was so crazy. I mean... How are they different than that cop? That's the fucking bummer of it all. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm? Anything more you'd like to add? I told you so, like... I didn't want to say it. I didn't want to say it. I didn't want to say that. I don't like being wrong. I've noticed that. But I am sorry. No, no, no. Wait. Come here. Come here. I'm sorry. This sucks. What? Why you saying "sorry"? 'Cause I broughtyou here and I'm related to all of them. No, it's fine. It's fine. Yeah? Yeah? Uh-huh. How are you so calm? Honestly, it's nothing. I like you on your racial flow, though. Is this a racial flow? Racial flow. Am I feeling a racial flow? Yeah, you're feeling racially flowy. Oh, fuck. The party. How bad can it be? They are so white. Like, so white! It's all good. Yeah? Yeah. You know, with my genetic makeup, shit gonna go down. I'm a beast. I'm a beast! Do you realize how dangerous smoking is? Yeah. Come in and sit with me. Please? Just for a little while. Please. Thank you. So you're comfortable enough, right? It's perfect. Thanks. Sure. You wanna know how it works? You just dangle a pocket watch in front of people's faces? Is that it? You watch a lot of TV. Uh... When I was a kid. Now you're feeling very sleepy. We do use focal points sometimes to guide someone into a state of heightened suggestibility. "Heightened suggestibility." That's right. That's right. Do you smoke in front of my daughter? I'm gonna quit. I promise. That's my kid. That is my kid. You understand? What about your mother? What about her? Wait, are we... Where were you when she died? I don't want to think about that. Home. Watching TV. Do you hear the TV? What do you hear? Rain. Rain. It was raining. Hmm. You hear the rain? Mmm-hmm... You hear it? Find it. Tell me when you've found it. Come here, Chris. Look at me. I found it. Where was your mom? She was coming home and she wasn't home. From work? Hmm. Hmm. And what do you do? Nothing. Nothing. I just sat there. You didn't call anyone? No. Why not? I don't know. I just thought that if I did, it would make it real. Hmm. You're so scared. You think it was your fault. How do you feel now? I can't move. You can't move. Why can't I move? You're paralyzed. Just like that day when you did nothing. You did nothing. Now, sink into the floor. Wait, wait, wait. Sink. Now you're in the Sunken Place. 'Sup, man? They're workin' you good out here, huh? Nothing I don't want to be doing. Yeah. I didn't get to meet you, actually, up close. I'm Chris. I know who you are. She is lovely, isn't she? Rose? Yeah, she is. One of a kind. Top of the line. A real doggone keeper. Right. Sorry about last night. What? My exercise. I didn't mean to scare you. Yeah. Yeah. And did it work? Did what work? You were in Mrs. Armitage's office for quite some time. Oh, yeah. Hmm? I guess I had too much of that wine last night. Can't really remember. Sorry. Well, I should get back to work and mind my own business. I think your mom hypnotized me last night. What? When? I went out for some air last night, and I run into her. And I can barely remember anything, but now the thought of a cigarette makes me wanna throw up. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I can't believe she did that to you. And I had some fucked-up dreams. What's! You dream? I was in a hole or something. And I couldn't move. It was like... Oh, God. That sounds terrible. I'm sorry. Hey, uh, what's Walter's deal? What do you mean "his deal"? I just talked to him. Dude's whole vibe is hostile. Did he say something? It's not what he says. It's how he says it, you know? Hmm. Maybe he likes you. Maybe he'sjealous or something. I don't... Are you fucking with me? No. So you think I've got a chance with him? All right, you got jokes. Putin a good word? Great. No, funny. I'm gonna talk to my dad about that. That's not... No, don't talk to your dad. It's not cool. It's fine, it's not a big deal-It's not a big deal. Forget about it. It's done. 0K3'!- Oh, boy. On, man. It begins. Are you ready for this? Yeah, I am. I'm not. There they are. Oh! So nice. How are you? Just smile. Smile? All right. How do you do that again? Yeah, just smile the whole time. Yeah, there you go. There it is. Oh, look, it's the Greenes. Gordon and Emily, this is Chris. Chris, this is Gordon and Emily Greene. Chris. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Chris. Nice to meet you indeed. Oh, that's quite a grip. Thank you. You too, man. You, uh, ever play golf? Mmm, once, a few years ago. I wasn't very good. Gordon was a professional golfer for years. Oh, you kiddin'? Well, I can't quite swing the hips like I used to, though. But, uh, I do know Tiger. Oh. Oh, that's great. Super. Gordon loves Tiger. Oh, the best I've ever seen. Ever. Hands down. So, Chris, uh, let's see your form. This is Nelson and Lisa. Hey, how you doin'? So, how handsome is he? I don't know, are you handsome? 0K3'!- Oh! Not bad. Eh, Nelson? So, is it true? Is it better? Oh, wow. Wow. Fairer skin has been in favor for the past, what, couple of hundreds of years'? But now the pendulum has swung back. Black is in fashion. Pardon me, I'm gonna take some pictures. Sure thing. There he is. ALL: Oh! Good to see another brother around here. Hi. Yes, of course it is. Something wrong? There you are. Do something with this. Ah, yes, yes. Oh, hello. I'm Philomena. And you are? Chris. Rose's boyfriend. Fantastic. You two make a lovely couple. Thanks. Oh, where are my manners? Logan. Logan King. Chris was just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here. That's nice. Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincotts were asking about you. Ah, mmm. Well, it was nice to meet you, Chris. Goodbye. What the fuck? Ignorance. Who? All of 'em. They mean well but they have no idea what real people go through. Jim Hudson. Chris. I know who you are. I am an admirer of your work. You have a great eye. Wait, Jim Hudson? Hudson Galleries? Believe me, the irony of being a blind art dealer isn't lost on me. How'd you do it? My assistant describes the work to me in great detail. You've got something. The images you capture. So brutal, so melancholic. It's powerful stuff, I think. Thank you. Hmm. Used to dabble myself, wilderness mostly. I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before realizing I didn't have the eye. I began dealing. Then, of course, my vision went to shit. Damn. I know. Life can be a sickjoke. One day, you're developing prints in the darkroom. The next day, you wake up in the dark. Genetic disease. Shit ain't fair, man. Oh, you got that right. Shit ain't fair. Hey. Come here, come here. What the fuck? You left me out there. Look at this. She unplugged my phone. Who? Georgina. I came here to talk to Rod, and I got no juice. So you think she did that because... Maybe she doesn't like the fact that I'm with you. Really? It's athing. So you are so sexy that people are just unpluggin' your phone? Forget it. Never mind. No, no, no. Stop, don't... Don't do that. Don't... Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It's all good, all right? They got you on display now, huh? It's weird, man. And it's the people here, too. It's like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for 'em. Yep, you're in it. Also, shit... I don't even wanna tell you. What? I got hypnotized last night. Nigga, get the fuck outta here. No. Yo, yo. Yeah, to quit smoking. But it's Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so... Bruh, I don't care if the bitch is lyanla Vanzant, okay? She can't fix my motherfuckin' life. You ain't gettin' in my head. I know. She caught me off guard, right? But it's cool because I'm cured. It worked. Bruh, how are you not scared of this, man? Look, they couldwe made you do all types of stupid shit. They'd have you fuckin' barking like a dog, flying around like you're a iuckin' pigeon, lookin' ridiculous, okay? Or, I don't know if you know this, white people love makin' people sex slaves and shit. Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're not a kinky sex family, dawg. Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the shit outta niggas' heads. Okay? But that was after he fucked the heads. Do you think they saw that shit comin'? Hell no. Okay? They was cumin' over there like, "I'mma just suck a little dick, maybe jiggle some balls and shit." No. They didn't get a chance to jiggle shit because their head was off their fuckin' body. Yeah, they still sucked a dick, but without their heads. It was fuckin' weird, detached head shit. You know, that's Jeffrey Dahmer's business. And thanks for that image right there, man. Hey, man, lain't makin' this shit up. I saw on A&E, man. Ifs real life. Yo, and it's the black people out here, too. It's like all of them missed the movement. 'Cause they probably hypnotized. Look, bruh, all I'm doin' is connecting the dots. I'm taking what you presented to me, okay? L'mma tell you this. I think that mom is puttin' everybody in a trance, and she's fuckin' the shit out of 'em. Thanks, Rod, bye. Hello. Fuck. Hi. I owe you an apology. How rude of me to have touched your belongings without asking. On... No, it's cool. I was just confused. Well, I can assure you, there was no funny business. Allow me to explain. I lifted your cellular phone to wipe down the dresser, and it accidentally came undone. Yeah, I told... Rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way. How foolish of me. It's fine. I wasn't trying to snitch. Snitch? Rat you out. Tattletale. Yeah. Oh, don't you worry about that. I can assure you, I don't answer to anyone. Right. All I know is sometimes if there's too many white people, I get nervous, you know? Oh. Oh! No. No. No. No, no, no, no. Aren't you something? That's not my experience. Not at all. The Armitages are so good to us. They treat us like family. This bitch is crazy. The bitch is crazy. Oh, hey, hang on. Chris. Chris, I wanna introduce you to some friends. This is David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki Tanaka, and Jessika and Fredrich Walden. Too many names to remember, but hi. Do you find that being African-American has more advantage or disadvantage in the modern world? Whoa! It's a tough one. Yeah, um, I don't know, man. Hey. Yo, my man. They were askin' me about the African-American expeflence. Maybe you could take this one. Oh. Well, well, I find that the African-American expefience for me has been, for the most part, very good. Although I find it difficult to go into detail as I haven't had much of a desire to leave the house in a while. We've become such homebodies. Yes, yes. But even when you go into the city, I've just had no interest. The chores have become my sanctuary. Fucking shit. Get out. Sorry, man. Logan. Get out! Yo! Yo, chill, man. Get out! Get outta here! Get outta here! Chill! Chill, man! Chill! Get the fuck outta here! Chill! Seizures create anxiety which can trigger aggression. Yeah, but randomly attacking other people? It's not random. You know, it was your flash. That's what set him off. Hey. Well... How's he doing? He's much better. I imagine that I owe you all an apology. No, no, no. We're just very happy that you're yourself again. Yes. Yes, lam. Hmm. And I thank God for you for calming me clown. I know that I mustwe frightened you all quite a bit. Especially you, Chris. No. I'm sorry. The flash. I didn't know. Of course not. How could you have? And you shouldn't have been drinking, either. Yes. Well, I'll have to let you all gel on the rest of the night without the aid of my marvelous wit. The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted. Logan' you just get some rest. It was nice meeting you, Chris. Yeah. Something to lighten the mood? Yes! Yeah, let's get this party back on track. How about sparklers and Bingo? We're gonna go on a walk. You sure? Shall we? My cousin's epileptic. That wasn't a seizure, right? My dad's a neurosurgeon. And that's what he said it was. I'm inclined to trust... That wasn't a seizure. What was it then? How long have you known that guy'? I met him today. Why? Man, this is gonna sound weird, but when he came at me, it felt like I knew him. Like you've met Logan before? No, I don't know Logan. I knew the guy that come at me. I think your mom got in my head, all right'? I think she got in my head. Yeah, and it worked, I thought... No, it did not. It didn't work. She got in my head, and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up shit that I don't want to think about. Like what? I just need to go. You wanna go? Mmm-hmm. Without me? Whatever you want. I told you about that night my mom died. When I didn't call 911, didn't go out looking for her. Yeah. One hour went by, then two, then three, and I just sat there. I was just watching TV. There's nothing you could've done. I found out later that, uh, she had survived the initial hit. She laid there bleeding by the side of the road, cold and alone. That's how she died in the early morning, cold and alone. And I was watching TV. There was time. There was time. You were just a little kid. There was time. There was time, if somebody was looking for her. There was time, but nobody, nobody was looking. You're all I got. I'm not gonna leave here without you. I'm not gonna abandon you, okay? You're not? No, no, I'm not. Oh, my God. You scared me. Let's go home. What? Let's go home. This sucks. This sucks. Let's go home. I'll make something up. I love you. I love you too, baby. Good night. Thank you. Come on, sweetie. Good night, Chris! It was great to meet you. Asshole. Yo! That's Dre. Dry;? Andre Hayworth. He used to kick it with Veronica. Veronica from what? Teresa's sister, that worked at the movie theater on Eighth! Yes, that is him! That is him! But wait... This is so fucking crazy! Yo, he's different. No shit. Why's he dressed like that? It's not that, it's everything. He came to the party with a white woman 30 years older than him. Sex slave! Oh, shit! Chris, you gotta get the fuck up outta there, man! You in some Eyes Wide Shut situation. Leave, motherfucker. Hello? You gonna be a... Hello? Chris? Oh, shit. His battery mustwe fuckin' died. Hey, handsome. Are you packing? Rose, we gotta go.

What is your purpose, Chris? What? In life, what is your purpose? Right now, it's finding those keys. Fire. It's a reflection of our own mortality. We're born, we breathe, and we die. Rose? I'm looking. Even the sun will die someday. But we are divine. We are the gods trapped in cocoons. Rose... I don't know where they are. Rose? Rose! Rose, give me those keys! Rose, give me... Give me those keys. Rose, now! Now, the keys! Be careful, bro. What the fuck? I didn't do anything. What the fuck is going on? Where are those keys, Rose?

You're not gonna give me a little credit? Okay, that was my fault. You were one of my favorites. You hear that, Chris? Huh? You're one of her favorites. Chris? Hey, it's Chris. Fm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna talk to you. Peace. Chris! Hey, it's Chris. Pm either away from the phone or I just don't wanna tafk to you. Peace. Yeah. Me too. College Fund. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. Mififons of Americans fee! The effects of aging. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Is there anything more beautiful than a sunrise? Hi. I'm Roman Armitage. And if you're watching this, you're probably wondering what's going on. There's no need to worry. Let's take a walk. You have been chosen because of the physical advantages you've enjoyed your entire lifetime. With your natural gifts and our determination, we could both be part of something greater. Something perfect. The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle. Our order has been developing it for many, many years, and I! Wasn't until recently it was perfected by my own flesh and blood. My family and I are honored to offer it as a service to members of our group. Don 'I waste your strength, don't try to fight it. You can'! Stop the inevitable. And who knows? Maybe one day, you?! enjoy being members of the family. Behold, the Coagula. What the fuck? Hello, Mr... Uh, Williams. Rod Williams. From the TSA? Yes, ma'am. You know all TSA issues should be brought up with your authorizing officer. Yes, ma'am, but this is not TSA business. Okay, don't call me "ma'am-" Othenmise we're not gonna get along. How can I help you, Rod Williams from the TSA? All right, here it is. Mmm. My boy, Chris, has been missing for two days. Your son is missing? Oh, no. Not my son, my friend. He's 26. His name is Chris Washington. He left on Friday with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage. She's white. All right. Go on. Look, Chris was supposed to come back on Sunday, right? And I've been watching his dog, Sid. That's Sid. Cute, right? So Chris sent this to me from his girlfriend's parents' house. See, that's Andre Hayworth. Okay? Somebody we knew from back in the day. Apparently, he's been missing for six months in some affluent suburb. Well, he don't look so missing to me. That's 'cause we found him, right? But Chris said he's acting real different. Different how? This dude is from Brooklyn. Huh? He didn't dress like this. I didn't use to dress like this. Plus he's married to a white woman twice his age. And that would explain the clothes. All right. Oh, Lord! Rod Williams from the TSA. I know, I know, I know. Okay, I'm trying to work towards this. Look, what I'm about to tell you gonna sound crazy. You ready? All right. Try me. I believe they've been abducting black people, brainwashing 'em, making 'em work for 'em as sex slaves and shit. Oh, sorry about the "shit." Sorry. Hold on a second. Then he sent me some weird picture and I'm like, "Oh, man, that's Andre Hayworth." This dude been missing for six months, right? So I do all my research, you know, 'cause as a TSA agent... You guys are detectives? I got the same training, you know? We might know more than y'all sometimes. 'Cause we dealin' with some terrorist shit, so... But that's a totally different story. So, look, I go do my detective work, right? And I start putting pieces together. And' see, this is what I came up with. They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves. Or sex slaves. Not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit. See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making 'em slaves or whatnot, but all I know is they already got two brothers we know, and there could be a whole bunch of brothers they got already. What's the next move? And don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothin' for you. Oh! White girls. Oh, they get you every time. Oh! Magic ain't real. None of this shit makes sense. Hello? Chris? Yo, um... Hey, what up? Rose, it's me, Rod. Hi. Where's Chris? He left two days ago. He left? Yeah. He got all paranoid, and then he freaked out on me. And then hejust got in a cab and left his phone. Wait. You haven't seen him? No, he never came back here. On, my God. Look, look, I've been calling his phone a bunch of times. Matter of fact, I went to the police. What did you say? I just said he was missing. Oh, good. Uh.-. Let me ask you somethin'. What cab company did he, uh, use to leave'? Oh, gosh. I don't know. I guess maybe a local one. Or I guess he could've called an Uber? Um, wait. I'm so confused. Oh, you confused? Okay. You know somethin'? Me too. Could you hold on one second? Okay. Okay. Hold on. You lyin' bitch. She is lyin' like a motherfucker. I know that... Ooh, that TSA shit tingles. This motherfuckers lying. Okay, I got you. I'm gonna record your ass. L'mma record the shit outta you. You talk too goddamn much. You're gonna say somethin'. Hold on. Record. Speaker. Unmute. Uh, Rose? Uh-huh? Um... So last time I talked to Chris, he told me your mama hypnotized him. Rod, just stop. Huh';? I know why you're calling. Why is that? It's kind of obvious, don't you think? What? That there's something between us. No. What you talkin' about, girl'? I called you about Chris. No, Rod, whenever we'd go out, I remember you looking at me. What the fuck you... No! Chris is my best friend. Look, if you did somethin' to him.._... I know you think about fucking me, Rod. Ain't nobody thought about fucking you. Why would you say some stupid shit? What the... You ass! Fuck you! I didn't wanna... Fuck you! Bye! Shit! God! She's so... She's a fuckin'... She's a... She's a genius. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, Chris. How's it going, buddy? You can answer. There's an intercom in the mom. Where's Rose? Oh, you dirty dog. You're one of the lucky ones, trust me. Jeremy's wrangling method sounds way less pleasant. I'm supposed to answer any outstanding questions, concerns you may have so {an. Apparently, our common understanding m' the process has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure. You could give a shit, right? Okay. Lei me just tel! You what it is. Phase one was the hypnotism. That's how they sedate you. Phase two is this. Mema! Preparation. K's basicaliy psychological pre-op. Pie-mp';? For phase three. The transplantation.

A sliver of you wili still be in there. Somewhere. Limited consciousness. Your? be able to see and hear what your body is doing, but your existence will be as a passenger. An audience. You?! live in... The Sunken Place. Now you're in the Sunken Place. Yeah. That's what she calls it. Now, I?! control the motor functions, so I?! be... Me. You'll be me. Good, good. You go! It quick. Good on you. Why us, huh? Why black people? Who knows? People want a change. Some people wanna be stronger, faster, cooler. Black is in fashion. Bur please don 'r lump me m with that.
