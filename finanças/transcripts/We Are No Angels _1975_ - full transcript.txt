- (film reel clicking) ( shredding rock music) ♫ Oh mommy ♫ Do you hear me ♫ I say, you double last the double oh the double beat ♫ You what ♫ I'd like the double bar another (mumbles) ♫ Oh oh (cheerful ragtime music) ♫ Oh, mommy my! ♫ Oh, mommy my! (growling) - Hey, watch your hose! Oh! - Oh, sorry. - Bet you musta growled just like that when you went into the ring, eh, against Black Bill. - No, only when I finished. - They called him the Nebraska Jawbreaker, what an unforgettable fight. You know how I can remember it, at the odds they gave. I took a flyer with two weeks' pay. Old Black Bull, he'd flatten many a good opponent, but he had never been in the ring with a real champion. I bet all he had to do was look into your eyes, and get knocked out by the glare. (people yelling and cheering) (splash) (laughing) - Hey, pull up your pants they're all full! (laughing) - Watch his eyelids, his eyelids! He's about to go, look! It' the third round, go get him, Raph! - Right. (slam) (thud) (smack) - [Angel] Think of the the 3000 dollars! - Huh? - Three, Raph! (smacking) - Hey McDonald! (slam) (groans) You're wanted on the telephone! (screams) (slam) (yells) (crash) - Don't hit the referee, hit Black Bull! (smacking) (slam) (slam) (slam) (crowd booing) 1500 each, yay! - The winner (smack). (crash) - He did it! - And that was the kiss of Judas. Did you ever see any of that 3000 dollars? No, well neither did I. - I should have known there was some screw job somewhere. Else you wouldn't be here tightening bolts from morning 'till night. - Okay, take it away! - You're next on the grease pit, mister. Careful, straight ahead. - Oh! - Howdy. - [Mechanic Assistant] Ain't that? - Judas. - [Angel] Oh oh. - Come here you. I'll break you in two! - Wait a minute! Let me explain, I'll tell ya everything. - You shoulda told me three months ago you thief! - Fight, fight! (crashing) - [Angel] Damn it, he's gone crazy! - [Raph] Crazy? What do you expect? (crashing) Swindler! Where's my 1500? - How can I tell you? Let me explain. - [Raph] You don't have to, new dapper and car! - Her name is Caroline. You like horns, these are Smith and Wesson, best. - And I'm the best car wrecker. - Hey! - Caroline's not mine. - The hell you say! I'm gonna rip it, I'm gonna smash it! Thief! - Halt! - Huh? - Thief maybe, but honest. This car's in both our names. That's the truth, Raph. - What's this all about underneath? - Underneath? - Underneath your fast talking. Another one of your hare-brained schemes to leave us with our asses hanging out, right? - Oh, I admit I had trouble recuperating one slight investment or two, but this time I bought a concession, a franchise for both of us. All you have to do is leave everything to me, and be good to little brother. (splashing) Sorry, as I was saying, I bought this concession for public transport, we got it made. Oh oh. - Brother, I'll make you a concession. The car stays, and you'll be there! Get out of here, or I'll break you! (crash) - Beg your pardon. - Kindly explain what's wrong with McDonald? He's our cleanest craftsman. - Far from a craftsman and clean, this McDonald is a scum. - Scum? You're, you're fired. - No I'm not, I quit! (crashing) (banging) The minute that rascal stuck his nose in here. (smack) - This is the first and last time I put my face in this filthy place. (huffs) (cheerful ragtime music) Music lessons, if at the time I'd left you the 1500, that's all you would have bought. - Well at least I'd know how to play. - Ah, wait 'till I've doubled your capital, then piddle away your money on music lessons. Like me to account for the expenditures? (silly car horn honking) Huh? - Yeah, 500 for the car, and then what? - That was just the beginning. To by the concession cost me a couple of thousand. As for the engine, 500. That makes three grand. Every scent of Black Bill's magic counted for. - Your accounts always work out, but I never see a cent. - Oh this time, no it's all arranged. It's organized, right Caroline? - Listen, if you don't tell me what's going on right now, I'm getting out, after I've smashed you. - I'll explain it, High Falls is a little city I know in the mountains. High Falls is miles away from a train. Use imagination, transport the passengers and merchandise out of High Falls to the train, and vice versa with Caroline, see? (cheerful marching band music) - That's enough! It has been rumored that the progressives are meeting in secret to plot against the conservatives, against the very men who founded this country! Who brought it wealth and fertility. And to them I say, I say, - Mala tempora currunt. - Mala tempora currunt for the progressives! (clapping) (goofy synthesizer music) - It's for the mayor's house. Three crocks he's busted, one month. - When I speak you must applaud! (slamming) (laughing) (clapping) (toilet flushing) - Oh, shit. - Oh, what do I do now? - I say applaud! (funky ominous music) (clapping) (smash) - Why aren't you applaudin' huh? - I'm not from these parts. (smash) - Ooh. (boing) (creaking) - Read this, it's the synthesis. - The what? - Eh, the compendium, the substratum. - Oh, yeah, yeah, the... - What it really is is the summary of the speech. - I remind the progressives that in as much as the railroad passes a hundred miles from here, any other mechanical transportation must keep its distance from our confinium. And whosoever dares to cross it, (whoosh) will get his guts blown out by a, a, pumperdick horn. (horn music) (cheerful ragtime music) (whistling) (coughs) - 2000 for a concession, okay, but I got a sneakin' suspicion that 500 dollars for fixin' Caroline-- - Is what? - Is still in your pocket. - If you don't trust me, you can check and see. - Just what I'm gonna do. - Hey, Raph, no! (rustling) No, not my long johns! - [Raph] Okay, keep 'em, they got no pockets. - [Angel] Thanks. - Where is it, where'd you hide that 500 dollars, you swindler? - Hey, wait, wait, will you? Don't leave me naked you dumbbell, come here! - Grandma, look at that nasty thing. - What? Oh, I'll report you, report your for outraging public decency. - Oh, and what's she doing? She's looking. You can't even drive. (crowd shouting out) (crowd laughing) (tearing) (laughs) - Caroline's too small for me. - Your case is too big, why don't you get a smaller one? - Oh, shut up. What do you know about music? - Tell me something, in whose name is Caroline? - In both of ours. - It means she's half mine and half yours. - Right, so? - You're on my side, so move. I always said we could get along since we have the same mother, but with different fathers. Mama was a Spanish lady and Catholic to boot. What made her marry a Scotch Presbyterian, I wonder? - [Raph] From what I've heard, your English dad was no choir boy. - [Angel] What do you mean? That's where they met, in church. - [Raph] So that's where I got jinxed. (cheerful ragtime music) (bang) - Now what's the matter? - [Raph] Where the hell are we? - I'll explain, the concession's paid for, and this spot here goes with our franchise. We open our agency here, and we'll make a lot of money. - I just can't swallow the cost of repairing Caroline's engine. - Have you got that printed up here? To haul a caravan with freight an people, Caroline's horsepower needed a boost, that's what our profits depend on, otherwise we won't make a penny. - If we don't make a profit, we've had it. - This time everything'll work out. And you just get it through your head, that if it wasn't for me, you know what'd happen? You'd go back to that grease hole. (crashing) - [Raph] Yeah, well look at you, you're already in a privy hole. - But I'm the first to use it. Hey, there wasn't one here. There wasn't one there, either. I wonder who dug them. - A big mole. - Yeah, big as you. (mechanical squeaking) - Howdy strangers. (laughs) Howdy! (laughs) Howdy. - Eh, what are you doing here? - Power drillin'. - What are you drilling for? - China, if I can bore through! (laughs) Get it, stranger? No? I was just jokin'. But there's plenty up in High Falls like you, thinking I'm a fool. I know that's your impression too. - Oh, no. - Well, I'm not mad. But only a fool would look for Mongolian molasses here, that's petroleum. - Mongolian? - Molasses. - Yes, the female of the big mole. - Oh no, by the way, though. You haven't told me your names yet. - Mine is Angel, and his is Raphael. (lullaby instrumental music) - Mine is Archangel. - [Angel] That makes three of us, eh Raph? - Uh huh, seems like we landed in Heaven. - Oh not yet we haven't. High Falls is in Heaven. - [Professor] Oh, would you fellas give me a ride to town? Musicians, huh? - [Raph] I am, he has a tin ear. - [Professor] I'm leader of the town band. - [Angel] You should let Raph play a solo with the band instead of himself. - [Raph] I'm getting mad. - [Angel] I'm getting out. - [Raph] Sit down. - [Professor] You two fight like progressives and conservatives up at High Falls. (horn honking) - [Angel] Progress is regress. Ha, they like jokes in these parts. (people chattering) (peaceful music) (sheep bleets) - Okay, you're one up on me. (laughing) (peaceful jazz music) (horns honking) - Nice and shiny. - And it toots. - Hey mister, how come it goes so fast? - 80 horses inside. - Hmm, a big guy like that's still telling baby stories. (laughing) (banging) (funky ominous music) (dripping) - Oh, hey Raph, you see what he did? Okay, okay, it's in my half. But she's in both our names. (whistling) Cut that out and give me a hand. (horn honking) With this many, you gonna ditch me? - [Thug] Give him a hand, Slim. - There are already too many horns in the town band. (squish) - [Angel] No, no. (smack) They're delicate instruments, you'll ruin them! (smack) Think what I've had to pay for these. (thugs laughing) Oh hey Raph, see what he did? - [Thug] I reckon' he's distracted. (splattering) Look here. - [Angel] The music. - Now you look. (bang) (thud) (instrumental rock music) (popping) (smacking) - [Thug] Take off his glasses. - [Gangster] Get 'em off, them off! (smack) (bashing) - Hey. (boom) - Strike. - What is it? - (laughs) Nothing. (bashing) (shouts) (laughs) - You again? - (Laughs) Just wanna tell you, she's dusty. - Hmm, come here a sec. (bang) (bang) (bashing) - Help Raph! (smack) Help! (thugs cry out) (growls) (men screaming) (smack) Watch it. Watch the left, watch the right. (banging) - Wait. - [Wily] Hit 'em. - [Polly] Stop it, Willy. Andy's scared. (bash) (man screaming) (thud) - All's well that ends well, I say. - There we go. Revised and corrected. (smack) Take it to headquarters. (crowd applause) - At last, a real man. - And the very least you two-fisted progressives can expect from Evelyn, is to have her invite you over, and join us for dinner. - Did I hear right? - Yeah. - [Polly] Willy's coming too. - That girl's just like her father. He was a fine mayor, and High Falls was a fine town. 'Till that scalawag Shark. Forced him into an early grave with a broken heart. Diving peaceable folks into opposing parties, Conservatives loyal to Shark, and us who are progressive. (laughs) Let's eat. - Indeed, progress brings violence. - I've been a regular boarder here quite awhile. I moved here last Mayday. That's when my grandma went to glory. - Sis? - [Linda] Yes? - Set another two places, we've got company. - [Linda] I'll be right there. (peaceful music) - My sister Linda, I'm Evelyn. - Angel and Raphael, but he prefers to be called Raph. He's no angel, look at that beard. - Come on. I'll give you a hand. - Oh, yes. - I'll serve it. Vegetable soup, she makes it better than my grandmother did. (laughs) (clink) - Oh, a fly. Don't worry, I'll get it out for ya. - [Angel] I'll get it, Professor. - [Professor] Soup's too good to pass up for a fly. - It's not for the fly, he's vegetarian. He'd like to kill people who kill animals to eat. It's true. - Children. (tsks) - Linda, let's have dessert and coffee. - How could you eat all those eggs? - The secret is to swallow them whole. - Oh, did you have anyone teach you? - And old ostrich. (laughing) - I like you boys, especially because you're both bats. Tell me, what brings you to High Falls? - Oh, we're intending to operate a transport agency. The house in the valleys where I'll make a depot site. - Well, I advise you not to, because that zone there is full of pompolou bricola underground. - [Raph] What's that? - Well, they're like little insects, parasites that infect the whole valley. Is that right, huh? - Ah no, mot on your life, mister. - They're signs that there's petroleum. What else would you do? - Ah, we'll be really in business when we get Caroline going. When she opens up the first time, they'll come running to climb on top. - Right, anybody'd wanna climb her. Fiery as she is, she's got bumpers front and back. - You see Raph here, here's trying to say that our Caroline has a great body. We jumped on her one at a time, and then both together. Right Raph? - Right. - Ah, but we'll provide her with working mate. One for there, one for here. It's essential in this business that anyone can be accommodated at both ends. (laughs) And boy, will the cash roll in, like a torrent. - Oh then I wanna be the first client. First one, then to the other. We're progressing, Evelyn. Progress is what let's our young fellas keep rejuvenated. (funky ominous music) (growls) (bang) - Hey, wait a minute. (bash) What's this for? (smashing) My sign. No, wait, no! (boing) (laughs evilly) Hey Raph! Get this fella, he doesn't feel anything. - [Raph] Neither do I. - Watch this, Raph. (boing) (laughs evilly) - [Raph] Throw it away. (whoosh) - Get out of here. - Over here. (smash) In the teeth. (smash) Now here. (smash) More this way. (smash) Thanks. It's not as valuable, Raph. With every blow he opens up a little window in our caravan. - [Ironhead] Now I'll open another one. - Whereabouts? - [Ironhead] In your forehead. - Come on. (boing) - Scotsman are ye? - Ar. (groans) - After all, he did give us a hand. - You know what I'm gonna tell you? - What? - Give me that 500 bucks you got left, I'm clearing out. - Oh, stop harping on it, will you Raph? The transport concession belongs to Shark until the first of April. It's only normal they want to destroy us. But we'll split up for security's sake. Okay, you sleep here in the caravan, and I will be the martyr, yeah, I'll sleep with Caroline. (bang) (funky ominous music) - You're a bunch a cowards. And I'm not paying for cowards. - I'm not a coward. - No, you're not. You're not a coward, you know why? You're an idiot. You know why you're an idiot? Because you got solder in your head (knocking) instead of brains. (men laughing) (clapping) (laughs) - The Professor thought you might like a cordial. - Hold this. May I? - [Linda] Surely. - This cordial is an infusion of herbs, it's a carburetor, unstopper-upper, another one of my specialties, bye bye. (laughs) - He's lost his marbles. - Hey what's it like? Cheers. - Cheers. (hiccups) A real unstopper-upper. (spraying) (chokes) - Ha, hot as a pistol. (groans) - Got burned, huh? Hey. Hey. - What? - Your eyes are watering. Get busy, work it off, kid. - Ha, ha, you're kidding me. Instead you should thank me, because I got you out of that hole. - In that hole I worked less, and got paid every week. - Yeah, but you never reckoned that that hole mighta been filled with your body dismembered by droopy lids, if he caught on to what we did to him before the fight. Hey, are you listening? I'm talking about Black Bull, you know what'll happen if he goes after you wide awake? He'll murder ya. - But the fight was your idea. And so were the sleeping pills. - Right. Would you have fought him without 'em? - Never in my wildest dreams would I have fought that beast. And you know damn well why I agreed to it. - Yes, of course. To buy your music lessons. That's all we need. (explosions) - Again! I won't stay in this house another minute! - What's wrong? Gertrude! - The toilet again, your Honor. - (Groans) That's the fourth one to blow up in a month. It's a progressive, Sheriff. (huffs) They're gunning for me! - Eh, lucky he wasn't sittin' on it. - Willy, you've got to stop blowing up pots, or Grandfather will get it. (funky ominous music) - [Mr. Pilot] Those two are fixing up that caravan that Stratton sisters used for a chicken coop. - Then we'll wreck it. Any comments, Mr. Pilot? - Let them finish it, Mr. Shark. - Later, it will be even more fun demolishing it. (upbeat rock music) (crash) (crash) (cheerful ragtime music) - Oh no, hey hey! (creaking) - I checked her over from bumper to bumper. And she's just the way mother factory made her. - Raph, were you really the mechanic in that hole? - What else? - Not the jack? - [Raph] I'll take you apart! - I was kiddin'. - I'm not! - Look, the Professor. - Don't stand there starin'. Oh, the game-leg. Nothin' unusual. And when your game-leg aches you have to lean on something for support, don't ya? (bubbling) Now, let's see. Nope, even if I straighten the pipe it's not enough. I'll have to make do with the one on the model. - Hey, Grandpa. (whistles) - Yeah, I spied them, I spied them a bit ago. Well, come on in friends. I'll look for a longer one. Bah! To finish the whole project, what I really need is economy, with a perpetual drive and motor. An unfrictioned motor, at the least. - Where the hell are we? - In the 13th century. What Marco Polo said he saw fountains of Mongolian molasses or petroleum, that could keep a machine running for a thousand years. And they thought he was joking, too. All joking aside, I'll find that stuff. - Grandpa figures there's a lot of molasses deep in the ground, enough to bury the town. - We'll find it. - Well that's why there's all those mole holes. - Grandfather makes them. He's an inventor too. He's a writer on animals and birds, and more than just that, he creates nice toys. - An archangel sent here by Heaven. - He got that moniker pinned on him in town for his inventions. And if I show you what they are, you'll see why. They're outside, (clank) (laughs) - Professor, if the chance ever comes up, could I play in the band? - Well, in fact my dear boy, there's just one little difficulty. The boys in the band are rather prone to jealousy, so we should wait for a player to catch cold, for example, oh, Benjamin, yes. - Why, Benjamin. (hums) (peaceful lullaby music) - Hey Raph, take a look at these contraptions. See? Archangel second, and archangel third. - What happened the the first? - Its wings broke. - [Angel] A victim of progress. - It won't happen again. The Professor's got it now, he figures. Both are able to carry a grownup by air to your depot site in the valley. - I know it makes you weak in the knees to think about it. From here to reach the valley, you gotta drop 2000 feet. But humanity is filled with morons. I'll bet my boots that sooner or later, I'll find two. (groans) (peaceful piano music) - [Willy] The professor sent you this, it's his new unstopper-upper. - Oh yeah? Hey, Angel, try it. - [Willy] This won't burn your mouth, it's milder. - Good. (laughs) - Hey. - In this nice, quiet town no one ever sleeps. And this damn town has seen the last of me, after I smash you. - [Angel] What's the matter? I let you sleep with Caroline. - [Polly] That powder doesn't work. - What, don't you remember. - Shh. - The mayor ran for 3 days. - Turn me loose. - That's just what I'm gonna do. I'll turn your insides loose. (farting) - Control yourself. Remember, you promised Mama to look after me. Ah ah, now wait a minute. - You wait a minute, I gotta run. - [Angel] Don't you wanna play your solo with the band? - I gotta crap (groans) not now. (goofy synthesizer music) (screaming) Out of my way! (smashing) (men screaming in disappointment) (groans) (marching band music) Stop, damn it! Had to be here, right? Couldn't you do it someplace else? Get out of here! Out! (marching band music) Out. (peaceful instrumental music) - Hello, Evelyn. Should I apologize? Did I offend you? But I'm delivering to you all I promised you, I brought you the muscle we need. I got Raph with me. Look Evelyn, don't act like a bear with me. My brother mustn't suspect what I'm doing for you until after the race. We'll win it just as you planned, and then the concession is all yours. Ha, I can say one thing, I know for sure once Caroline opens up, I'll be the first in line. (cries) (whoosh) Evelyn! - Go to hell, you and Caroline. - Evelyn! (crash) - Now I'll play doctor, and give you vaccinations. - Typhoid. Hey, we're missing something. - [Polly] What? - Quick! - (cries) Oh, go away! - Evelyn, let me talk, ha? Evelyn, let me talk. This is all a misunderstanding, you mustn't cry. You misunderstood. - Why is she crying? - Because she's afraid of vaccinations. - Evelyn, stop crying. Hey, for Heaven's sake, shoo shoo, will you? Look what else I have to put up with? Evelyn. - Go away. (cries) - Please, give me a chance, let me explain to you what. - (Cries) I said go away. I never wanna see you again. - Caroline, Caroline is my car. (smack) - Oh Angel! Angel? - Oh, excuse me. (groans) - Where you going? - To the fields, to get you some daisies. (groans) Wait here. (goofy synthesized music) Ooh, lovely day isn't it? Good morning. Good morning. Ooh. (marching band music) Stop, stop! (mumbles) warehouse! (marching band music) - [Shark's Thug] Those two got the caravan ready. - What's it say on it? - Rapid Transport, Angel and Raphael. - It's ready Mr. Shark. - Ready? Then start wrecking it. - It'd start with the car. By now it's obvious to me that those two are waiting for the day of the race to win the concession for the Stratton sisters. - Hey boss! We'll take care of it, boss. - You? Not only are you bigger idiots than Ironhead, you've got not guts. - I can make up for that. - No guns, stupid. - [Cross Eyes] That's what I thought you said. - Mr. Shark, I have an idea. I think I found the right man. - The right man? What we need are men. All available men. I wanna see that jalopy and caravan in pieces, in small pieces. (funky ominous music) (people making commotion) - Wait. - [Man] Shove along, Lacy, come on home, come on. - Who's caravan is this? (smash) - Why do you have to wreck it? We worked so hard. Hey. (smash) No, don't wreck my caravan. Not anymore, it's not. (growls) You! Hey, why are you waiting, aren't you gonna help me? Hey. (groans) - We're the demolition squad. - Demolition squad? - Tell 'em to roll up their sleeves. Hear that? - Hey Raph, these guys are putting us to work. - There'll be some overtime too. The car. - On Sunday? The preacher'll be mad. - [Shark's Thug] So what? - Okay, let's forget about the preacher. - But I tell you one thing. If he gets mad, you know what happens then? Tell him. - You know what's gonna happen? I'm leavin'. - Huh? (smack) (upbeat rock music) (men yelling) (men screaming) (thud) (banging) - Willy, now listen to me. Violence is not polite. (thud) (screams) (cheerful ragtime music) (ban) (whoosh) (thudding) (smack) (smacking) (men screaming) (whooshing) (laughing) (thudding) (whooshing) (laughing) (smacking) (clunk) (screams) (crunching) (groaning) - I told you not to look! Turn 'round. (crunching) (screaming) (clunk) - Turn around. (creaking) (smack) (crash) (cheerful ragtime piano music) - Don't slug me, kick me. (crack) (screaming) (thudding) - No, no, (squeaks). Don't tweak so hard. (whoosh) (thud) (smack) - Sit down! Sit! - It's freezing! - Sit. (thudding) (laugh) (clunking) (clunk) (clink) (bashing) (whistles) - You. (high screaming) (thud) What now? - Don't slug me, I can't hit back. It hurts me just to lift it. - A stone. - Put me down, put me down. (skidding) (laugh) - Make room. Get down or you'll drown. - Please. (upbeat rock music) (clunk) (cheerful ragtime music) - [Shark's Thug] Ooh, what's he got in there, iron? Oh my foot! (cries) - Fire one! (clink) Fire two. (clink) (screams) - Now that he's out of balls, let's see what he fires. Who's nicked my ball, huh? Don't move. Don't even breathe. (whooshing) (smash) - Hey, are you crazy? (laughing) (laughs) Put the ball back. Put it back, I said. Go on, you. (smack) (ban) (clinking) (whistles) Strike one. (clink) (smash) - [Angel] Bull's-eye. (boing) (screams) (thud) (smack) (thud) - Bash your brains out. (cymbals crashing) (smack) (thud) Where'd you learn how to play? - The Philadelphia Athletics. - I can't even play in the band. - Too bad, you could play first base. - Now I'm gonna play you! (smacking) Come here. - Hey, quick, quick, quick. Caroline! - [Linda] Keep out of it, Evelyn! - Don't touch Caroline. (thugs laughing) (whoosh) (clunk) Ha, you see that? UCLA, 1909. When I threw my javelin, I set a neck record. (groans) It's their tough luck. - Now it's your tough luck. Since you're so smart. - Raph, Raph. (slam) No, no, don't smash that case! - Ah. - Raph! (smack) (thud) No, no, it's a delicate instrument! - Instrument. (crash) Where is it? Huh? Come here. (cheerful ragtime music) That does it. (crashing) (slam) (click) So I see. (smack) (clunking) - [Shark's Thug] Heads up. He's got it. (smack) (crash) (thud) - [Shark's Man] Here, hold on to it. You take it. - Why me, pass it to Slim. It's over there. (thud) (smack) - You take it! (popping) (clinking) - Pick these lousy teeth out of my beard, will ya? - Ew. Hey, put that barrel down. (thud) (screams) (whooshing) Help me, Raph! (cries) (crash) By the skin of my teeth. I saved your case, put up a good fight, aye? - Yeah, by the skin of your teeth. You also lost that. And wherever that came from, I'm sure there's more. - No, no, no. (tearing) Let go of it. You searched my pockets like this, so help me. I programmed everything, wait a second, Raph. I worked it out, I started the ball moving. You'd be nowhere without me to make it move. - Yeah? Okay, then let's see you make that move. - Hey Raph, did you see, huh? (laughs) - Hey. That 20 is mine. - Give it to him. (crash) - We're poor, but honest. (thud) (crash) Well, he tried. (clunk) What'd you say? - Eh, there was a fly on your ear. Let me go! - [Raph] Come down. (goofy synthesized music) (crash) (clink) - Look at them. I sent them out demolish, and they come back demolished. - It wasn't my idea. - Starting tomorrow, nobody in High Falls, and I mean nobody, will ever mention the word &quot;progressive&quot; in my presence. Or the word &quot;progress again&quot;, or write it, or even think it. Now get outta here. I said, get out. They've even put them in order. - We had to obey or get blown up. - I'll blow you up. I'll blast you to hell! (booming) (explosions) (screaming) (cheerful ragtime music) - [Man] (laughs) What's that? - [Guy with Bike] They call it an automobile. The front end toots, and the rough end smokes. - Come on in. Not the right moment now. - How did that dynamite work? - [Angel] Perfect. - [Polly] Like the mayor's toilet. - Shh. - Ah, it's you who's been stealing my blasting caps. And after I warned you, Willy, not to touch them. Off you go to bed, without your supper. Run along. Polly? (laughs) And don't you lead them on, either. Those two could open a school for mischief, but for you, it's a great day. One of the trombones in the band has dislocated his jaw. So we have had to change our program. (laughs) You can do your solo today. You can play with the boys in the band. - I'm really curious to hear them. - [Professor] Well, let's go then. - Now? - [Professor] Yes. - Like this? - [Professor] We're waitin'. - But I'm out of practice. - Huh, a real musician makes practice sound wonderful. Don't be afraid, you'll be brilliant. - Oh shut up, what do you know about music? - It remains to be seen. (marching band music) - Raph, that's not your place, I want the brasses on the other side. Now, now, don't waste anymore time. That's where you belong. - [Raph] But professor, I don't-- - [Professor] Quiet! - Look Bedsman, what guy blows would choke you. (marching band playing random notes) (people laughing) - Hey, look. - Darn it. On the other side, quick. Here. - But professor, what's difference if I-- - No, don't argue. You stand there. Ugh, a piccolo with the brass, what next? - He's a fine boy inside. You ought to tell, him, Angel, you have to explain everything he doesn't know about. - [Evelyn] Linda's right, he's your brother. - Nah, we're just partly brothers. He buried his father upright, just imagine. One end, so as not to buy so much land. What should I say, &quot;Raph, your piccolo case is where I hid the 2000 dollar for the franchise. Tomorrow morning, I'll pay the whole concession price to the sheriff.&quot; - Yes. - And that would be the end of me. (marching band music) (clunking) (piccolo music) (trumpet music) (piccolo music) (trumpet music) (piccolo music) (trumpet music) - Mr. Shark, I would like to make a suggestion. Contest is set for tomorrow, I'll run that jalopy off the road. And they'll end up at the post office in a Hearse. That team'll fly. Come on, make 'em fly! Faster! Faster! - Mr. Shark, - [Shark] Faster! - Mr. Shark, may I? - You may, but my mind's made up. - It's last Friday's paper, read what it says under the picture. - [Shark] Determined to make mincemeat of Raphael McDonald. - [Shark's Assistant] Black Bull, that's the man we need. - Black man with a car? A progressive black? - Maybe, but that's the only man who can get rid of them. Look what the reporter says, and read the caption under the picture. Don't you think that'll settle our problem? - No, I'll settle it with my horses. Besides, he'd never get here in time, anyway. - What if he's already here? (trumpet music) (piccolo music) (trumpet music) - [Band Member] Let's pack up and go home, fellas. - [Angel] That was hard work for me because I know nothing about music. Ugh, I can't play anything but ragtime, so I'll give it to you. Like I said, your practicing was wonderful. (smash) No, Raph! (groans) Now wait, Raph let me explain everything to you, huh? Please let me-- - There's nothing to explain. You're a liar and a thief! - Let me at least get a word in, ha? Please let me get-- - When I get you, (thud) you have the nerve to come here, you could do this to me. I busted my ass, promising my mother I would look after you, right? I brought you up, didn't I? I sent you to college to earn a degree, with my money. And how do you repay me? You learned to play the bloody trombone. - But after I did my homework. - Shame. - [Angel] I learned to play in my free time, honest Raph. I had time for sports too, I won my letter, I got my masters'. - And I didn't even have time to master a piccolo. And I said, &quot;Professor, could I play a small solo with your band?&quot; I mad a complete ass out of myself. (whoosh) Come here, you thief! - [Angel] I'm not a thief. - When I catch you, I'll damn well kill you. - That's no way to keep your promise to Mama. Mama! Wait, what did I do wrong? After all, it's your fault, too. You never give me time enough to explain anything. - I've had enough of you, and Caroline, and the concession, and her. - Raph, don't run out on me. - The next time we meet up, you'll be lucky if you can walk out! (crashing) - You were lucky once. - Look Raph, give me time. You mustn't just up and leave me here. Raph, I depend on you. You listening? (gasps) - You ruined my career, McDonald. Now you're gonna pay for it. - [Angel] Alright, go your own way, Raph. - Oh no you don't. (crash) (groans) Why is he blinking? Still sleepy? - Yeah, hear his eyelids click? - My blink is a nervous tic. - [Slim] And this is a click. (clunk) (screams) (crash) (funky ominous music) (groaning) - Break, break, break his dirty neck. (crash) (clunk) He can't see you, fire two. (thud) (groans) (slam) (crash) (thud) (crash) (groans) (thudding) - Come on man, stand up and hit me. Come on, I'm waitin'. (thud) (groans) (crunch) (yells) (thud) (crash) (laughs) - Now I'm waiting. (crash) Come on, come on. - [Raph] I'm comin'. Wanna bite? (clang) (slam) (crash) Get up. (whistles) (groaning) (crashing) Someone up there doesn't like it. (laughs) (laughing (clang) Watch it, this round is with you. - [Angel] Now, now, Raph, don't get excited. (bang) Let me explain. - Shut up! - [Angel] I made up that sleeping pill story. I needed the money for the concession. (slam) If I don't' get the Sheriff that 2000 dollars tomorrow, we're out of the race and it's goodbye transport agency. You can't leave me now. - You get in my way, and I'll run over ya! Forget the 2000, forget I exist, you crook. (peaceful music) - We started a night to remember happily, with song. (laughs) (cries) (sheep bleets) (bell ringing) - All participants in the contest are requested to align their means of transportation behind the starting ribbon. We remind the public, that it'll stand along the road. (people cheering) Anybody wishing to watch the arrival of the contestants is requested to go to the valley. To the post office. The last wagon is leaving now. (fireworks exploding) (cheerful marching band music) We remind you, that there is still time to contest. - [Bill] You sure you don't wanna race? - I'm positive. - [Man] Hooray, hooray! Let's start the race. Hooray, hooray! - Get a horse. - Just my luck, when I'm ready to leave, she won't start. (crying) What's the matter? Andy? - Andy. (sobs) Andy. - The little lamb, they roasted it. (sniffles) (whistling) - Where is it? - [Polly] There. (cries) - This banquet is not taking place. (smashing) (people screaming) (thudding) (smack) - They started it. (groans) (thudding) - [Shark's Thug] They wanna stop the contest. (glass breaking) (people yelling) - [Mayor's Deputy] Oh, the violence. - [Mayor] Now, everyone. We set an example ever so often. Go get 'em, conservatives. - Now, start the race! - That's against the rules, we still have five more minutes. - Start it, or I'll break your damn watch. (honking) (smack) (thudding) (smacking) (smack) - Get away from me. (crash) (thudding) (bashing) - Start the race. (smacking) (crash) (cheerful band music) (whistling loudly) - [Shark's Thug] The lasso's ready. (horse neighing) (crash) - [Raph] Oh, shit. - [Shark's Thug] Here he comes, run, run! (sheep bleeting) (peaceful lullaby music) - We didn't want you to leave. - You're not a couple of kids. You're a couple of monsters. - Oh, but it's your fault, because you're nice. - That's nice, Raph, and because you'd have missed the bonanza of a lifetime, Brother. (gun shot) Hey, at the next shot, we start. Me, you, and Caroline, huh? We're all signed up for the race. - My money! - Run, run, get out of here. - Hand over my money or I'll smash you to pieces, you crook. - Now wait a minute. Raph, don't be crazy. We start at the next shot. - Off with the conservatives, pull up the car. Go on the car, down to the (mumbles). (screech) - Have a look at the crook behind you. - Now I'll make my comeback, this is a hundred horses. - [Sheriff] Did you hear that, a hundred horsepower. Hey, where you all going? - A hundred horsepower. I'm gonna smash you to smithereens. - Look, we haven't got a second to lose, eh? You can smash me afterwards, okay? - [Sheriff] On your marks, get set, go. (gun shot) - Push. Keep pushing. Bat shit. Now what? - I gotta feeling I'm gonna smash you right now. - Wait a minute. - [Raph] There's nothing to wait for. Your race is over, see. No motor. The garage, come on, push. Hurry, hurry. - [Raph] You mean the professor's barn? It's uphill. - We gotta get her out of sight, faster. (goofy synthesizer music) (crash) It was all figured, one for there, one for here. I never suspected what this devil nicknamed Archangel would think of to stop us. - Take our idea and stuff it up your nose. Professor. - Hey, wait. The archangels! (people cheering) I think I got it, but I better test it on you. This is right. Tighten this. - I you think I'm gonna fly, you're crazy. - This one here, the other one there, I'm just using you as a model. - Not gonna fly. - One goes like this, the other like this. - Oh, watch where you put your hand. - Yeah, let's see where we put our hands. Keep one on this pole, and the other one on this pole here. - Oh, our hands, you mean yours, Brother. - Nah, I've had a lot of practice, don't worry about me, I fought a war with things like this. They who whoo! (screaming) Control it, I'm coming! - [Raph] I can't control myself! (peaceful instrumental music) Ooh, what the hell kind of war did you fight? - I sprayed poison on Spanish flies. See Raph, they stay up just fine, I told you, the wind. - The wings yes, but my pants, nooo! - Sure, we're not angels! (epic peaceful instrumental music) (people cheering) (crashing) - Hey, conservatives, you just lost the concession. - Come on, fly. Up yours. (laughs) - [Woman spectator] Shark can still win. - [Male Spectator] What's gonna stop him? - A miracle from Heaven. - [Woman Spectator] A miracle? (epic peaceful instrumental music] - Raise the wings like this, we're landing! - I'm raising mine! But when I hit ground, I'm gonna clip yours! (groans) - [Angel] Wanna go back to that grease pit, then get up and run. - [Raph] Run where? - Those ruins over there, that's our goal. At Boston College, I was twice cross-country champion, and I can still run. - With my 500 dollars! Bastard. What are we telling them? That we're transport by plane? - Come here. - [Raph] I don't see any goal, all I see is a haystack. - [Angel] Just wait. - [Raph] Oh, damn it, all I need is a sprained ankle. What the hell are you up to now? - Pull the rope. - [Raph] Huh? - All programmed, all organized. Caroline first, Caroline second. One going, one coming back. Hope in. (horn honking) (whipping) (yelling) - [Mr. Pilot] We are rid of them, Mr. Shark. - [Shark] Finally. - [Mr. Pilot] We made them eat our dust. - Conservatives, up yours. - Make 'em fly. Those two bastards are still in the race. Faster! (yells) (cheerful ragtime music) (crowd cheering) - Angel! - Raph. (laugh) - As of this moment, the Stratton concession begins. - Stratton, yes. (laughs) - Because it belongs to the sisters now. - I guess. (screaming) (laughing) The sisters? - The Strattons. - You mean for Miss Goggle Eyes and Miss Google Eyes, you made me a big, a big! - Listen, I have a proposition to make. (smack) I'll chase you clear to Hell and back! - Linda, Linda, hurry! (crash) - Hey, you want your motor? I only borrowed it. - I never expected that from you. We nearly lose the concession. - [Raph] We lost it anyway! - No, no, Raph, no! - Now I've got you. All my life, I've coddled you and now I'm through! - [Angel] Let me explain! (screams) (splash) - I'm through! (splash) - They are mad men! - Tell me truth, what was between you and her? Tell me, the truth, or I'll! - Shame on you! Raph! You are failing to honor your word to Mama! - Don't you mention Mama to me. Tell me the truth! (splashing) - Somebody! Pull 'em apart! - [Angel] It was love at first sight. - [Raph] Which one? (splash) - Evelyn, we met in the general store! - [Raph] And you bought her bill of goods for love, you jerk! I'm gonna drown you. (epic peaceful instrumental music) - Get him, for Christ's sake. - I want my money. - Raph, see. - Peek at the ground, you! Hip hip hooray, petroleum at last. I told 'ya, we'd find oil! - Taste it. Right? We're rich! We're rich! - [Professor] Great day! - We made it, Little Brother! (laughs) We are rich, we are rich, we are rich. We're rich, we're rich, we're filthy rich. - [Angel] Professor, you beat us all. (cackles) - I bet this belongs to them. - It's ours, they have the concession-- - It's ours, it's ours? - We have the oil land! Yeah, so let's get married! (screaming) - Hey rain, rain! (cackling) - (Laughs) We're all black, now we're all one family. - Last pass, yeah. - At last, right. (laughs) (cracking) (cheerful ragtime music) ♫ Oh, mommy my ♫ Oh, mommy my
