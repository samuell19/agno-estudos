The big guy was the former minister of the interior. - Ah! Excuse me. François de Vierne and his parents attend the burial of their godfather and friend: André Laroche. Oh, I'm sorry! The Prefect of Police. - High society. This one was a bigwig. You're lucky to have this be your first service. A 1st class burial with extras and military honors. It's beautiful. - It's expensive. And you know how the deceased cares about draperies... Undertaker! Elisabeth of Poldavia Family up front, please. - He had no family. We are his board of directors. - Alright. This way. Who are these guys? - They're not even signing! In 1st class burials, it's always the one in the back who's truly mourning. Really? - Yes. Sometimes it's just a little employee. Sometimes it's the maid. I even had a funeral once where only the dog was sad. But... He wasn't allowed into church. Behave, François. Please. - Sorry. François, the man who lies there was not only our friend and your godfather. He was once my lover, and he was your father. You jackass. - Monsieur de Vierne? - Good morning, notary. - Good morning. May I ask you to stop by my study one of these days? The deceased left a message for you. A message? -Yes. - I certainly will. - Sir. Perhaps I shouldn't have told you. You're going to hold it against me. On the contrary, mother. You've relieved me of a great burden. - How much did they tip you? - Not much. Come, mother. I didn't want to get in touch with him. His life was so brilliant. He had probably forgotten me. But he was a good man. And he was your father. He was the best of all of them. Better than anyone in the world. You admire him. I know. But don't try to become like him. Never. You know I'm an artist, mom. And I make an honest living. A shock for Councillor de Vierne: his son is a thief. Alright, Joseph. Thank you. In his own room? In his bookcase, behind the Littré dictionaries, sir. Us servants can't help but pay attention to dust. What alerted me was that Mr. François seemed to be perusing those big dictionaries very often. And knowing Mr. François... - That's enough, Joseph. You may leave. You're looking at a stricken man. I'm a Councillor at the Court of Cassation. And after a lifetime of honesty and hard work... My son! It isn't so much the value of the object but I thought it was my duty to tell you. - Alas! Monsieur would like to see Monsieur in his office immediately. - Another sitting? - I'm afraid so, Mr. François. Good. Ah, here it is! My wife is very short-sighted, you know. - Monsieur! - Father. Hello my dear Baron. I must leave, my friend. With all my condolences. It's an immense loss. I held Laroche in high esteem. A great statesman. He was but a friend. The godfather of my son. But we considered him as part of the family. Fortunately, he died before this. My dear Baron, you're forgetting the chain. My respects to the Baroness. She asked me to thank you for the flowers. - Oh, it was nothing. What does this mean? Worthless little items, as you probably noticed. The forks are all mismatched of course. Some of them are Christofle, I think. Good taste is hard to find these days. - So you're a thief, Monsieur? - Such a big word. I cannot resist the pleasure of stealing small things at the social gatherings I'm invited to. Stealing is frowned upon as a common man's livelihood. But this kind of purloining, from people who are well off, is just an innocent game. A lifetime of honesty and hard work... My own son! - Hmmm... - What, "hmmm"? Nothing, father. I'm just saying "hmmm". The scandal will be dreadful, sir. You have the choice between this or enrollment in the Zouave regiments. I'll recommend you to Liautey. They need hotheads in Africa. You have 2 minutes to make your choice. Either way, I'm cutting you off. You're on your own. As I have always been anti-war I'll have to die or to work. It's rather short notice. I'm asking you to weigh the options until noon tomorrow. Sorry! Unless there were a third solution that would solve everything. I any case, you're not my son anymore. That's what I was about to say. The deceased was very fond of you. Really. Shortly before his death he handed me something. You know, he liked to be original. It isn't exactly a will. - Huh? - No. It's a record. - He left me a record? - Yes. I don't even own a grammophone. I detest those things! - Wait. I arranged for one. I took care of everything. Put that here. Alright. Please note that the wax seals are intact. I'm breaking them in your presence, as I've been instructed to do by an accompanying letter. Very good. That'll be all. Shoo! Now let's listen and find out what the deceased wanted to tell us. Please. Notary Puisette, are you alone with François de Vierne? Good. Now will you kindly leave, notary Puisette, and leave Mr. de Vierne alone with me. Yes, you heard me. Out, notary Puisette! - Alright. - But... - Come on! Are you alone, François? Just got back from my funeral? You were probably sad. Moderately, knowing you. But what I'm about to tell you should cheer you up. If you are man, that is. I wasn't just your godfather, as your mother will confirm. I was your father. But I have another revelation that could change your life. - Oh, sorry! - I chose, for reasons you don't need to know, to die as the honorable André Laroche, Knight of the Légion d'Honneur and close friend of the King of Poldavia, who had just made a fortune by creating that country's merchant marine. In truth, and you'll be the first to know, I wasn't André Laroche. I was Arsène Lupin. Yes, François, my boy. Forget all about that silly Councillor to the Court of Cassation who raised you. I loved your mother very much, and you are the son of Arsène Lupin. Just a minute, dad. Let me process that. Go on, dad. Oh, sorry. ...your mother very much, and you are the son of Arsène Lupin. - Yes! - That's why I'm going to treat you like a man. That fortune I made with my business in Poldavia, I bequeathed all of it to charities. I despise charities and I don't believe in good causes. That's why I did it. It'll be my final bad joke. - And a bad one it is! Above all, I didn't want to leave you money that would soften you like a bourgeois kid. I will pass something else on to you. I hope you'll be receptive. My secrets, my disguises, and an introduction to my surviving henchmen. And then, there's another son of mine I've lost track of. His mother was a little waitress. I ask you, should you find this brother, to share these secrets with him. The former king of Poldavia is in possession of very important documents. Have you got a pencil? On notary Puisette's desk. Ah, yes. Right in front of you, in the blue pot. Got it? Okay. Take note. First off, this record will be destroyed as soon as you've heard it. So pay attention. Then, one month to the day after my death you will go and introduce yourself to his Majesty on my behalf. He lives in with his family, in an old private hotel that his friends have offered him. Introduce yourself under your name and say only: "The goose is cooked". He will understand who you are and what your mission is. There'll be huge profits for you if you're talented enough to make good use of the documents that he'll give you. L'intran, latest edition! War in the Rif heating up! Sudden death of the former King of Poldavia! The hidden life of the exiled kings! L'Intran, latest edition! - Are you okay, Monsieur François? - I believe the goose is cooked. I can always lend you some money if need be. I might take you up on that, because the Zouaves are out of the question! Out of the question! What Zouaves? He's had nothing but Dubonnet and already he isn't making sense. Hey pal, what are you doing these days? - As you can see, I carry on. I see. Do you want to work with me? So now you're working? The Prefect of Police was urgently summoned to the ministry of the interior. It seems that the death of the former King of Poldavia created quite a flurry. Their embassy initiated a procedure. They want to recover the crown jewels. How does this relate to the ministry of interior? You should have seen the boss' face when the minister called him. He was green. There's probably more to it. There comes the Prefect, in quite a state! Brace for it! Imbeciles! You're all imbeciles! And so am I! Ganimard, what the minister just told me... I'll never forgive you! - But... Quiet! I was a mat, a rug. He walked all over me, like this! He was bestial. And he was right! You hear me? He was right! So... This intelligence service of ours, what's it good for? To tell us the opening hours of our museums? Shut up or I'll break you! And then I'll be the one walking all over you. Just like this! You know what they made the minister do? Because of your gross carelessness. Don't you know? They made him give a speech... by Arsène Lupin's grave! - But boss... - Silence! André Laroche, the great shipowner, are you following? - Yes. No you're not. You're not following because you're incapable of it. - Aren't you? - Yes. André Laroche was Arsène Lupin. The revelations made by the Poldavian embassy concerning the stolen crown jewels have unmasked him. State secret. - And tomorrow it will be in all the newspapers. - Lupin! Lupin... Exactly! Your friend Lupin! Learn that, you who never know anything. Shut up! Not a word! To have a minister of the Republic make a speech at the grave of Arsène Lupin! For you, it will be 12 bullets. In the pits of Vincennes. That's what Mr. Poincaré said. At least there's a good thing in all this, Mr Prefect. If Lupin's dead, we won't hear about him again. Knock it off! Come in! What now? Probably more bad news. I'm getting used to it. The 2nd Brigade has just received a call. Theft of modern paintings from Viscount Delrot's. Twelve paintings were taken. Here's what we found pinned on the wall. Arsène Lupin sends his regards. Ganimard! Gérard Dagmar performs every night at the "Banjo", a fashionable nightclub. Oh, Mr. Gérard! - Still deep in the news items? - Stolen paintings again. And the funny thing is that the theft was signed Arsène Lupin. The day after his death. - You know paintings always carry a risk of forged signatures. So Gérard... When will you show me your illusions? When you have regained yours. Illusions involve two people. Excuse me. Don't wear yourself out. It's hopeless. - She has a boyfriend? - No, but she's not your type. Why did you refuse to dance with the man at table 14? Do you even know who that was? Yes, the second son of the King of Romania. - So you knew? That's even worse. Listen, next time you refuse a client their dance, you're out of here for good. You're a dancer, sure. But here the dancers work the room, just like everyone else. You know Catherine... You're lucky to be so cute. There's a moron sleeping by his bottle of Taittinger. So, what are you doing here? - Go! - Okay, I'm going. With a smile. It's okay, Dagmar. I'm keeping you for another week but on one condition: Leave Catherine alone. - I want no fuss among employees. - Private hunting ground? In any case, I'm the only one here who decides when open season is starting. - Where've you been these past 3 days? - Hiding. - Where? - Montmartre's cemetery. Engraving eternal regrets into marble plates. - What? My uncle's a marble mason. I stay at his place when the need arises. - Cemeteries are good hideouts. - They're relaxing too. Not a cop on the horizon. These days, the dead are the only Frenchmen left who aren't under surveillance. - Monsieur Gérard, a call for you. - I'm coming. - What? - You heard me. - What did you say? - Last warning. But who are you? You heard me. Last warning. Theres a gentleman who's not happy at all. He doesn't want us to use the name of Arsène Lupin. "Last warning", he said. Some lowlifes trying to steal the brand from us? If anyone's entitled to sign as Lupin, it's you. You're the heir to the name. Note that it's not in my interest to claim my father's will. It probably amounts to 227 years of prison. But it makes me happy to have him drop off his card once again. - So, the goods are sold off? - On the Atlantic. Sailing. Americans are very interested in painting. And I'm very interested in dollars. - Here's your share. - Thanks. You kept one of them? - Is he famous? Pica... - ...sso. Picasso. He's a young painter. It shows. - I never asked your opinion on painting. He's a friend of dad's. Bye, my little criminal! I'll call you. Goodbye, my pretty! This way, it will attract less attention. What do I do? - Leave it. I'm sure I'll see him again. Mademoiselle... - What do we say now? - Thanks. - Thanks who? - Thanks, Gérard. And I took you for a nice and quiet girl. You have strange acquaintances. You don't know who they are at all? Okay. Chapter 2. The plot thickens. - Where shall I drive you? - Stop here. - You live around? - No. - Where then? - Stop here. Alright. - Be nice and don't get angry. - Distrustful, are we? No, but I prefer to go home alone. - Just today, or every day? - Every day. Good night. - Good night, who? - Good night, Gérard. What if we tried my master key? Magic, you know, is the triumph of the prop. Someone must have forced the lock. Hands up! - Basile... - Oh, sorry. It's you, your Highness. I apologize to Her Highness. I took the liberty to arm myself and I was standing guard. We have just been robbed. These thieves were very rude. It's not the first time. They come, they make a mess and then go. They've been here before? So, the ones who tried to kidnap you... They were the same? Not having found what they were after, they intended to make you talk. Right? What is it they were looking for? Here, instead of chatting, help me get this back up. What were they looking for? If you stay silent, I'm letting go. Oh damn, damn! Dad's hats. Your father's not here? If he were still on this earth, I wouldn't have to dance every night. Your father was an extremely decorated man. - That was his job. Catherine, are you there? It's grandmother. Don't tell her I dance. She thinks I work at a charity. It's a curse! The heavens are abandoning us. Basile, turn the icons to face the wall for a week. That'll teach them. I must congratulate your doctor on his pills. His sleeping pills are wonderful! I didn't hear a thing. Didi, I introduce you to Gérard who works with me. You feed widows, you host orphans. You are a saint, sir. - Oh, madam... - Yes, you are. Ah, a young saint... Besides, the old ones have no merit. My son would have decorated you for sure. He decorated everybody. Gérard, you stand before Her Majesty Elizabeth III, Queen Mother of Poldavia. Country in a state of revolution, Queen Mother in a state of collapse. Don't call me Majesty. It's ridiculous. Besides, in France, you've lost the habit. Look! They even opened up the cushions. Snow! How charming. Reminds me of Poldavia. One of these days, these brigands will strangle your Majesty. You have a marksman in the house. - It's my brother. He's unbearable! Michel, if you shoot at our guests again, I'll pull your ears! Got it? I knew they came back. - No one was here. Go back to bed. Don't lie. I heard them. His Majesty Michel XIV of Poldavia. And now, go to bed! - No way! "No way"! Where has he learned that expression? - At municipal school, obviously. - At municipal school? He goes to the municipal school? - Will you call the police? We loathe police. We had one of our own and we know what they're like. I can sympathize but... - That's the point, sir. We don't want to involve the French police in our state secrets. Even if Mr. Von Krantz sends us burglars I'll never disclose our secrets to strangers. Why are you two making signs at me? Did I say something wrong? So what? Well. Good night, young saint. It's very kind of you to take care of the poor. In Poldavia I had my own, but the revolutionaries took them from me. Put my suicide at the Claridge on the front page, you hear? - Too late. Never mind, put it on page 6 then. They commit suicide after 1 in the morning, and they think they can still make the front page! Nathalie Cartier, Gérard's lover, is a reporter at l'lntransigeant. Right now, if you like... When? It's nice of you to pick me up. I just need to finish this. Did you read my piece on the theft at Viscount Delrot's? How do you explain someone was so tactless that they signed a theft as Lupin, just two weeks after his death? That "tactless" act might be a thoughtful gesture. Imagine someone who wanted to pay a filial homage to their deceased father. What, was it you? And you let me write that silly piece! What's the use in having a dirty little thief for a lover if he doesn't even give you any leads? Is that all I'm good for? My grandmother used to tell me we should be afraid of thieves. Michel, want to play football? - I have to go home. Look... Revolution or no revolution, he's always there guarding me. See you. Majesty! Majesty! If you don't mind waiting here. These ladies are receiving gentlemen from the police. Someone called the police? No, but they still came. I'll leave you. My kitchen is in such a mess! You know, they are good people but they have no practical sense at all. Fortunately, they have Mrs. Lupia. Mrs. Lupia is me. ...that's why the special services appointed me to put myself, on behalf of the French Republic, at the disposal of Your Majesty. Isn't it, my good man? I'm listening, Madam. - Well... Grandma! - Silence! The Queen is speaking! When we fled Poldavia we were able, thank God, to take the crown jewels with us, and some very important documents too. My son distrusted banks. I sympathize with him, Madam. The new ambassador of Poldavia had legitimacy to seize these documents. So my son asked the help of a friend, Mr. Laroche, to hide the jewelry case. But they both died. Without telling us where. So His Majesty didn't say anything before dying? Nothing, sir. Nothing. Except one thing, but it's probably unrelated. What was it? On the verge of death, my son sat up. He probably wanted to tell us his secret, but he could barely speak. So he whispered something. What was that? - A number. A number that doesn't seem to mean anything. The number 27. 27? Yes, 27. And then he lay back down. - What are you doing there? And you? So you're police, and searching my room now! You're quite the back-stabber. Your colleagues down there are leaving. I'll take you to them. - I'd rather not see them. I've fallen out with them for professional reasons. Your toys are nice. - They were, but look at the mess those pigs made! This theatre looks like fun. Who gave you that? Mr. Laroche, a friend of dad. He loved opera. It's a very nice gift. If only my dad had given me such a gift. Gérard, what are you doing here? Mrs. Lupia let me in downstairs and I went up to see your brother's toys. I came because I wanted to see you in the daylight. I've only ever seen you at night. What an idea! And, are you disappointed? No, on the contrary. You're a daytime girl. See you tonight then. You'd better leave. Grandma wouldn't understand your wanting to see me during the day. I think they were telling the truth. The jewelry case was not in the house. I may have a lead. The Consulate... - Of Poldavia! But first, the consul. He's attending a cocktail at my mistress's. Which one? - The other one. Driver. Go to United States Plaza at Mrs. de Bellac's. No, Marcel Achard isn't a cycling champion. He's a young avant-garde writer. Where is he? - There. Isn't it obvious? Been writing the society column for long? - It's my first time. - It shows. How about that one, who's he? Baron Von Krantz, Consul of Poldavia. Is he German? - Even he himself doesn't know for sure. Some people claim he started as a bartender in Saigon. No boat can be built without his permission. And the other one? - His secretary. His shadow. Hans. - Hans who? Siegenzwerk. It's a rather difficult name to remember. Especially for a Frenchwoman. Excuse me, dear Baron. I've been trying to reach you for a week. I had business with my father. Then your father wears too much perfume. You should tell him. Why Baroness... That's a lovely lorgnette. Did you only invite monsters? I feel like I'm flicking through an old agenda. Oh, a blank page! Please introduce me. - Nathalie Cartier. - The reporter! You look like your articles. Sure, they're a bit catty but it must be a pleasure to get clawed by you. Even from afar. - I'll leave you two, François. But remember that you already have quite a full agenda. It's funny. Looking at you, I also see a resemblance. To whom? A face I can't quite put a name to right now. Don't forget, my dear Ambassador, that I already did a few favors to the Poldavian revolutionaries. My promise to recover the crown jewels means you can count on me finding them. Besides, I have my personal reasons to do so. Where do you think they are? If the royal family still had them, they wouldn't be in such misery. The sale was due to take place the same day the King died and had to be postponed. It'll take place tomorrow, at the Drouot hotel. Look at the catalog. Old uniforms, a few trinkets, rags. It won't even pay their debts. Well, good luck anyway, Baron. Interested in Poldavian antiques, Mr. Von Krantz? You are a man of taste. But breaking chairs and children's toys is much less tactful. It's not very kind of you. - How dare you talk to me like that? A thief is an artist first. A nice thief is as difficult to perform as a Mozart sonata. I should be angry at you but you have aroused my curiosity. You play the piano, Mr. de Vierne? - Only when people ask me politely. But I'm warning you, I'm one of the most expensive pianists in the world. You like money. - Like everyone. I play for my pleasure first. I'm an amateur. Thanks. You have the item? - Presumably. - I'll take that as a yes. How much? 50. - 50.000? 50 million. You're either mad or very young. I wouldn't like to make a living at the expense of ordinary people. It's not fair. I always work with people who can pay. I'm sorry. I'll have to say no. - Think about it. You could give me your definitive answer next Saturday. Mrs. de Bellac told me you've invited us to your hunting weekend. I didn't know that she'd asked you to accompany her. She doesn't know it herself yet, but she will be delighted to. See you Saturday, Mr. Consul. Excuse me. Tell the Doctor to gather his collaborators. Borsak? Vladimir? - I don't want to know their names. I can play Mozart, too. When a girl is troubled she always spills her drink. You're vainglorious, too! But it's over now. I'm about to lose my prestige in your eyes. Why? Because for the first time in my illusionist's life, I feel like telling someone the truth. Is the truth ugly? Well... it's naked. I'm not quite what you'd call an honest guy. I find you very nice all the same. I'll see you home then. - I said "never". You're right. I've run out of luck with you. It must be karma. - Let's drop it. Catherine... You usually let me know when you're interested in a girl. I'm interested in her but not the way you think - Ah, it's her... She's charming. Be careful. Sometimes you go on a treasure hunt but end up finding something else. But, my treasure, I have already found you. Right. You could tell me something nice. 27. Why 27? You count your kisses now? I'm trying to find the meaning of the number 27. The Academy. How many seats? - 40. The apostles? How many apostles? - 12. Who sits in the 27th chair at the Academy? A journalist has to know this. Mgr. Baudrillard, I think. But I can hardly see Mgr. Baudrillard sitting on a treasure. How many muses? - 9. Too few. I'd need three times as many. As for the deadly sins, men have searched for centuries but have only found 7 of them so far. - But some of them are very pleasant. 27... The paper's sending me to the Drouot hotel tomorrow. Have you seen how nice this little piece of Sèvres porcelain is, #19? I don't care about some Sèvres porcelain right now. Besides, porcelain's very difficult to sell off. I'm not telling you to steal it. You could buy it for me. I never buy anything. Admit that it would be stupid coming from me. Your little Sèvres is awful. - It's so lovely! And it belonged to the King of Poldavia. - To the King of Poldavia? 23, 24, 25, 26... 27! I think I'd be more interested in this terra-cotta sculpture depicting Alfred de Musset. "Item having belonged to Mrs. Sarah Bernhardt." Are you crazy? So you suddenly like Musset! "Expert: Mr. Delafoi" I think this man won't be able to come. The day after, at the auction. Miss Morel, face on, please. Now, smile. Perfect! Thank you, Miss. When did she enter the Comédie-Française? - Under Louis XV. Who is she? - It's Sybille Morel! You don't know her? Sybille Morel? It can't be! Or she must be at least 100. She is, Madam. She is. Hello, Mr. Commissioner. - Hello. A distinguished gathering. That's what we owe the pleasure of your visit to, I suppose. You're right. Apart from the pleasure. Mr. Delafoi had the right idea to stay in bed. Thank you for replacing him. You seem to have a cold yourself. I almost refused this auction. And I would have, had the seller been a common man. All this stuff is worthless. - Indeed. We'll finish this as fast as possible. Come on, follow me. Item #26: A clock encrusted with tortoiseshell. In working condition. Gift from the city of Kichisep to the King of Poldavia. Asking price is 2.000. 2.000 here. - 2.000 on my right. 3.000. 3.500. 4.000. 4.000 on my right. No one? 4.000 once. 4.000 twice. 4.000 thrice. Sold. Now for item #27. A terra-cotta depicting... depicting Alfred de Musset and his muse. An item that belonged to Mrs. Sarah Bernhardt. Starting price is 5.000. ls there a buyer at 5.000? Me. 5.000. - 5.000 here. 7.000. 8.000. 9.000. 10.000. 11.000. 12.000. This young man is not gallant. To refuse the statue of Musset to one of his young heroines. 13.000! You won't have the last word. - Maybe not the last word, but the last move. I concede. We must make way for youth. 13.000 once. 13.000 twice 13.000 thrice. Sold. Ah, I am delighted. I'm thrilled! Mademoiselle Sybille. Come here, please for a photo. Stand here, please. Miss Morel. Be careful with the statue. Raise it a little. Very good. A little to the right. With a smile. Perfect! Come on, gentlemen. Behave yourselves please! One last picture, Miss. Arsène Lupin! Police! No one is to leave this room! This is Commissioner Ganimard speaking! All exits are guarded! Calm down ladies and gentlemen! Please return to your seats. The police is taking care of it. First we'll proceed to a general search. I said a general search! The Governor of the Bank of France is beyond a search! You'd find zip. - I'll lodge a complaint with the Government! Hide those letters you brought with you, you fool. I think you should investigate on the stage first. Could you please interrogate the expert who replaced Mr. Delafoi? Gentlemen, gentlemen, please... I don't understand. This man ran into me. My head hit the wall. And he ran away. Which way? - That way. Every time you show up somewhere, the Police end up looking like fools! But I've 30 years in the force, Mr Prefect. I know Ganimard. You are the dean of imbeciles. You're welcome. I expect your resignation. Look, I'm giving you a final chance. The last, you hear? You have 8 days to find Arsène Lupin. But he's dead! - Figure it out. It's not my problem! It's funny. It's the same but larger. How could you know that? Of course, you know Paris by heart! I turned the statuette inside out but nothing. Not the smallest clue. It's solid stone. It's probably not in there. Look at the woman! You know that women with buns are not my type. Her arm. What do you see at the end of her arm? Her finger. But at the end of her finger, moron! There's a column. And you're not wondering why she's pointing us to a column? Well done but a little late. Oh, he's very good. I wonder why he's taking the liberty to use dad's cards. It's time we asked him for an explanation. I put all the lights out, Mr Viscount. So it's as if we were asleep. Okay. And the windows? - Half-opened, Mr Viscount. Perfect. Mr Viscount is probably expecting someone. - Exactly, my dear Édouard. A distinguished visitor. A colleague. Who's nice enough to be punctual. Hello, Mr. Dagmar. I've been hearing about you for quite some time. Finally, I see you. And I got you. First, let me get a look at you. A charming young man. And very proactive. But a little reckless. Didn't you find it a little too easy to enter here? And that chest a little too visible? I'll open it for you. I owe you that. Look. There's the wall behind. That's it. The Lupins are born pranksters. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? In front of him! Arsène Lupin. Your respect pleases me. Let's see... What will we do with you? I know. Only a small punishment to teach you to respect another's property. Édouard! They're in the garden. All around. Von Krantz's thugs? - Who else? We shoot on sight? - No, I've a better plan. A wicked man, this Von Krantz, but well-informed. What do we do? - Nothing. You'll hear some noise coming from here soon. But do not move at all. You get it? - Not at all. I'm not asking you to understand but to keep quiet. Go now. Go now! For now, the court shall grant you probation. The luxury of clemency. Can I go now? - Just a second. There's another luxury I'd like to afford myself. You were right to show interest in the little princess. Her dowry was worth it. Lupin on the other hand was completely disinterested. At least have a look at what you came for. Careful now. The treasure of Poldavia. 100 million at least. Take a look at it. A good look. Right. Stop making that face. Look at the real Lupin. He's having a lot of fun. So long, François. Lupin sends his regards. Very good deal. An excellent deal. You see, one should always keep fake jewels in their safe. Sooner or later, it comes in handy. Kartenberg, Kartenberg... Kartenberg... Now I understand the concern of our friend Von Krantz. Look. I think we killed two birds with one stone there, too. The Doctor, leader of Von Krantz' henchmen, admits defeat. Your men are idiots. I told them to search the house. - It's too late now. The real diamonds are probably very far by now. - With the papers. What papers? - You take me for an idiot too? A small advice: don't try to find out the why and how of things. We all ask ourselves some questions but the answer is often unpleasant. Being a reporter like me would be less dangerous for you. You know a guy named Von Krantz? I think he's behind the blow I've received on the head. Do I know him? We have his bio ready at the office, pictures and all. We expect a nice scandal from him. Where can I find him tomorrow? Easy, somewhere between London and Ankara. But he'll be back in Sologne this week-end. He's organized a big hunt. Our newspaper is covering the event. In Sologne? How convenient. The doctor recommended a trip to the countryside. Try to make Von Krantz' driver spill the beans. If he drives him anywhere, keep track of the mileage. We must keep an eye on all their moves. Look at that... What are you doing here? Spying on me? I told you our paper had to send someone. I made sure it was me, that's all. Jealousy? - Curiosity. You're going to pay for this. A drink, Mr.? - Thanks but no thanks. I'm delighted to see you again. Now we can have our second argument. You like arguments? I like women who are difficult to tame. And you think you'll tame me one day? - I'm sure, and my instincts never fail me. François! My husband is looking for you everywhere. Damn! - You should at least pretend to listen to him. He adores you. Can't get by without you. I know, he calls me ten times a day. I can't stand it anymore. We'll eventually have to break up because of him. - François! My friends, if you're ready we will go and take our places. You'll carry Mr. de Vierne's rifles. Does it bother you if I stand here? - On the contrary. My compliments about the other night. Your men are quick to attack. Your counter-attack was even faster. Stylish and sporty too. I return your compliments. I'm sorry. So, it's a draw. We resume the discussion where we left off. Okay. I'll be accommodating because I like your style, Mr. de Vierne. And me very demanding because I don't like you at all, Mr. Von Krantz. You're trying to make me angry. Excellent method. But I must warn you, you won't succeed. I'm made of steel. Let's talk numbers. - Cock in front of you, sir! How much? You're too impatient. It's almost rude. Let's chat a bit first. The papers you found in the case are fakes. But I want to read them. It will amuse me. Come on, answer now. How much? How much? I don't know. Money's not all I think about. What if I'd rather publish the facsimiles of your check stubs in a newspaper? Just to see the face Kartenberg would make. The face who would make? - Kartenberg. You know, the Emperor of cocaine. The one who blew up a compromising boat with all its crew. Twelve sailors lost at sea. A detail. Kartenberg, sentenced to death in absentia in 2 or 3 countries. Come on. Try to remember. Kartenberg died in a car accident 3 years ago. And for 3 years Kartenberg's been calling himself the Baron Von Krantz. He got a little face change... but you can't rig fingerprints. They're still there at your fingertips. How much? - Come on! Don't always talk about money. Look. The King's shot. Doesn't it remind you of anything? - I accept your number. 50 million. You should have accepted it right away the other day. 50 million is not a quarter of your bank account in New York. Say a number, then. And let's hurry. - We've all the time, my dear Von Krantz. As I told you, I like the game more than the money. My pleasure now is to have you wait for my decision. May I? I must see to my other guests. Go ahead! But watch out for hunting accidents. They're so silly. And so unnecessary when one has taken his precautions. My compliments too, Mr. de Vierne. Whiskey, champagne, orangeade? - Let's say champagne. I advise you orangeade. You haven't quite won yet. It's dangerous, you know. - What, hunting? Not if it's for pheasant. But the big game here is something else. Never mind me, but there are some beaters here I haven't seen before. Thanks. - It's free. Cock ahead, sir! All the cars are back, but he's nowhere to be seen. Something must've happened to him. - It'll make a nice article for you. - Gérard! You seem very moved, my dear, for a reporter. Look. You got the mileage? Here. François! But where's François, my friend? - I don't know. He must be in his room. Leave him be, or people will wonder why you're always with this young man. - Oh. There's nothing really interesting in all this. You're really very clever, Mr. de Vierne. - Or it's you who are an idiot. Come on! Now, where's the case? I want an answer. The answer is there, right beside you. It's patently obvious. You see, you are stupid. Why do you force us to ruin your face? Do yourself a favor. Where's the jewelry case? He's sending you for news? - Exactly. You make some progress? - Methodically. In other words, you got nothing. Start the second phase of the operation. You're certain no one can come here? You worry too much, this factory's been closed for five years. I know, you are idealistic, vegetarian and you drink water. You're being paid for this job. All of this needs to be finished in the next hour. Still suffering from acute mutism? Let's apply some treatment then. You're in luck, dear man. You're dealing with a doctor here. A real one. But I'm going to need some tools now. So follow me. 29.911... and 29.863. They made a 48 km round trip. So we're looking within a 24 km perimeter. It's very detailed. What is it? - An Ordnance Survey map. Look. A quarry. There's lime dust on the wheels. It must be around there. Maybe this building. Clinically speaking, your case is an interesting one. But you'll see, we've got all we need right here. And we have a license to use all of it. To think that when I was young I was never able to run a radiology practice. See that trap door? They used it to get rid of the factory's waste. The current carried everything to a grinder 100 meters from here. Anything that falls in there disappears without a trace. Grinders cause no fuss, and leave no traces. Nothingness. It's more efficient than quicklime. And quicker, too. Look, the quarry. Do you see that? It's sulphuric acid. It'll keep on dripping, and eat through the rope in 20 minutes. Then you'll take a dive and there'll be nothing left of you. A few drops of sweat on the floor. That's all. Because you will sweat of fear before you die. People always sweat before dying. It's disgusting. My men will stay there behind that door. Let them know if you change your mind. I see you're not wearing a watch. Be careful. Only 20 minutes. What is this? - An old factory, I guess. Anyway, there is no other building around. Wait for me by the car. And don't move unless I call for you. Dim that lamp a little. Your address book. All those pretty female names... It must be very sad to say goodbye to all of them. Not to mention the blank pages... All those names you could have added. It doesn't make you change your mind? - No. You wouldn't refuse me one last cigarette though? I'd hate to break the tradition. Especially since they're yours. Oh, sorry! Smoke it slowly. It's the last one. Take your time. Why hurry? Yes...Why? Of course. - Bastard! You're enjoying this, huh? You weren't so cocky the other night at my place. Yes, you had a good laugh at my expense. It's my turn now. What is this? A luggage room ticket? You're going to let me die in the hands of these bastards? And you claim to be a follower of Lupin! Lupin was a gentleman. You hand out his cards as flyers. That's all. I have a good reason to "hand out his cards as flyers". 25 years ago, Lupin had an affair with a little restaurant waitress. She was tender and lovely but Arsène Lupin was a busy man, and he forgot about her. This is ingenious, by the way! Anyhow, he left her a souvenir. Me. This is Lupin's son you're looking at. It was you? - What do you mean by that? It means that you're my brother. "Your brother"? Confidence for confidence. My mother was a Countess. She wasn't tender but she was lovely too. And Lupin also left her a souvenir. Upon dying, my father let me know through the notary that I was his son and that I had a brother he wanted me to find. Oh, my! You're my brother... Can the reunion and let's hurry up because I'm about to go down this trap and then it'll be bye bye dear brother. - Damn it! Up against the wall, near the door. 7 cigarettes. 7 luggage room tickets. Should be fun. - You have fun, little brother, it's more for your age bracket. We're family, agreed. But don't think I'm giving you all my marbles just like that. Is my poor brother thirsty by any chance? - Very. And now you're going to give me some advice, François. I think we owe it to ourselves, between Lupins. I have your 7 luggage room tickets and I have to collect those 7 suitcases before you can. Let's see. What would you do if you were in my place? Bastard! You gave me a sleeping pill? - Exactly. See how us brothers understand each other? Bastard! - Don't complain so much! After all those emotions, 24 hours of rest will do you good. But I wonder what we're going to do with you. What do you think, Charly? - Meh. And you, François, any ideas? It's getting late. Mr. and Mrs. de Bellac finally take their leave from Baron Von Krantz. This François de Vierne is impossible! I think you got him riled up for some time now. It's not a reason to take French leave. I'm his best friend and I brought him. What will Von Krantz think of me? - You shouldn't worry what others think. It's for the best... Come on! That's it. Good bye, my darlings. When will this train reach Perpignan? - Oh, not for another 48 hours or so. Porter, now there's a job I'd never take. What's inside the last two? One dragoon lieutenant, one! A Credit Lyonnais collector. A town constable. And now a priest. He had disguises in every railway station in Paris. Must be one of dad's inventions. It's simple. All he had to do was get to the luggage room, then re-emerge from it... ...unrecognizable. No use now though. These tickets must have been at least 6 months old. Except the one from Gare d'Orsay. It's only 3 days old. Now you tell me! There's fresh plaster on the trowel but plaster has never been an address. You want an address? Look. There's one written here. Prefecture of Police. - Now there's an address! "Paris Department of Works. Administrative notice: Works to be done at the Prefecture of Police." Here, change into this. We'll go and check on "our" works. So, what was wrong with that plaque, was it not installed correctly? It's not that, there was a spelling error. There's only one "n" in "reconnaissante". Oh? Yes, I thought so too... It's coming off. And? You were right. This is the spot. Now you see it pays off to have been a marble mason's apprentice. Hey, when are you bringing that back? The inauguration is tomorrow. Don't worry. We'll be here at 10. Excuse me, sir, when is the next train to Paris? - Oh, in... In exactly 9 hours. There's the express in 15 minutes but it doesn't stop here. Okay, but hurry up. You could've thought about that earlier. Say... Nice machine, isn't it? Are they difficult to drive? So, how long until Paris? Hard to say with this asshole ahead who won't go faster than 80. I can't drive over him! So what? What a dope! He's taking advantage of our signals. Holy cow! That's the first time I have an engine stolen from me! ...because, ladies and gentlemen, Jean Delepine was not only the policeman you all knew. He was also a man. A man in every sense of the word. A generous man. As hard on himself as he was indulgent with others. And you know, gentlemen, as you live it every day, the inner struggle of being a policeman, even and especially at this grade, who refuses to renounce, at any cost, his human qualities. Incompatible they are, certainly, those two fundamental ideas. It's for a woman that you left, right? Who did you spend the night with? - With a cow. Big slob! I only ask to forgive you but at least tell me her name. It's her. Admit it. Admit it now! With you, I'm never wrong. - Never. You only happen to be a little ahead sometimes. Let us thank him on behalf of Paris. Let us thank him on behalf of the nation. It's a scandal! Never seen anything like it! What does it mean? Shall we go? - Don't move. It's the first time they play the Marseillaise for Arsène Lupin. Mr. Prefect of Police, I expect your resignation! Ganimard! Look! Look! The opposition members are triumphant! Lupin swore to bring down the ministry and now he's succeeded. You are revoked! Say, my little brother is very clever! You're sure that Léon is taking care of them? Absolutely certain. Gérard is on his way to recover the jewelry case entrusted to Charly's uncle the day before. It's there. To Saint-Ouen. You see there are advantages to cemeteries. I wonder what better hiding place you could possibly have found. - I have one that can't be beaten. What's the safest place for a stolen item? In the hands of its owner. The only place where the police will never search for it. That's very clever of you! No, it's silly. But I think dad often engaged in that kind of silliness. Stop him! Stop him! Help! Miss, quick! Taxi! There you go. - Well done, Léon! Gérard? Gérard, are you in pain? Why have you been attacked? Because I was coming to see you. I was bringing you something. They took it back from me. - You found the case? Yes. And I'll have to find it again. I don't want you to risk your life. It's only money. You know, Catherine... I am a thief. I've risked my life for less. And this time, I'm afraid it's not just about money. Your Highness! Your Highness! I'm back from school but her Majesty was already gone. Two men came to take him! One hour ago! They've kidnapped him! Wake up! Why kidnap him, now that they've got the case? They're not the same guys. That's why I'm so worried. Are you Miss Catherine? - Yes. A gentleman asked me to give you this. "Your brother will be returned in exchange for what you know. Stroll around at 22 hours tonight along the Ourcq basin after Flanders bridge and bring the item. If you don't come or if you call the police..." "You will never see your brother alive again." Gérard, what should we do? They're capable of anything. We must stall and have them believe we still have the case. Go for it, Catherine. I'm here. Don't be afraid. Go around to the other side and keep a close eye on her. Good evening. Come on, get in. Did you bring the case? - No. I came to ask for more time. - Really? You should think about your brother's health. - Just a couple of days. My little girl, you take us for idiots. She brought company. Let's get out of here. Hey, hey! Gérard... Hey! Gérard! Crap. He's still there. Step on it. I think we've lost your friend now. So, is it "Sire" or "Your Majesty", dammit? "Sire" when you're addressing the king and "Your Majesty" in the third person. Who's the third person? What are you saying? The third person is him. Where are the other two? - Shut up! You're too stupid. It's hopeless. You tried to trick us earlier. You were not alone. Why would you want to bicker with us? All things considered I'm easy-going. But my men are extremely touchy. You have to be careful with them. I want to see Michel. To be sure he's alive. And our word? It doesn't count? First, the case, Miss. You're in prison. - Holy cow! Touch wood! - Kemal... Open it. Quick. The key. Blast, my jacket! - File an expense report. Doctor! If you value your life, tell your men to release the kid. Come on. I'll count to 3. 1... - Don't do that. It's useless. I'm not the leader. I follow orders like the others. - 2... Listen. It's all settled. We've made an agreement. Bring the kid. You understood? Bring the kid. Killing me would be useless. I'm only an instrument. - Right, of torture. I know a lot on Von Krantz. There is a fortune to be made. You're exhausting! That's all well and good but what do we do? What? The doctor? He must be... Really? Okay. But... what about the kid? No? Really? Okay. I'm on your side. Try to understand. I must escape them. This is the opportunity. Help me. Doctor... Doctor! Well. Go for it. Michel! Where are they going? Answer! The bastards! I am begging you. Make an effort. They're going... They're going to... Hello. - Hello. Is Gérard here? - No. He hasn't been in all night. He had an appointment with Catherine, didn't he? Oh, he told you? - He doesn't tell me anything anymore. Why are you making that face? - No reason. Of course there is. And you're going to tell me all about it! I don't know if I can. You're not getting out of here until you tell me everything! Mr. de Vierne? - He's upstairs, but hurry up. He's off to New York and his train leaves in 30 minutes. - Thank you. It's nice of you to come to say goodbye. - Gérard has disappeared. Then you're leaving with me. No luggage or passport... We return, married or divorced, if we realize it was a mistake. Stop joking. He's disappeared with Catherine and her brother. They're asking for ransom. You know what. All you think about is Gérard. I'm thinking about you too, you're the one I'm asking for help. I'm sorry but I have to be in New York next Monday. We'll talk about all this when I'm back. But it's a matter of hours. Maybe minutes. You forget Gérard is your brother. - That's precisely what I won't forgive him. He's saved your life. - Yes, but he locked me up with two cows. François, I thought you'd be different. I thought you'd be generous, like Lupin. I can't stand napkins. You're a monster. There you are. What have you been up to? The boss is looking for you everywhere. The Sûreté just called, something huge. You're leaving for Dieppe immediately. Me? - Yes, you. Go see the boss and hurry up! In Dieppe, Von Krantz' cargo vessel "Danaé" is about to cast off. Are you coming or what? - Yeah... - And hurry up! So? - That's it. We're full. Stop! Catherine. No further. You promised me. Please, let me come with you. There are 10, 20, maybe more of them. I won't be able to protect you. And Michel? - It's for his sake I'm asking you to stay. Gérard... Our good Doctor... That'll be his final gift to us. Keep an eye on Her Highness. I'll be back. A gift from heaven. Well done, my friend. I had nothing to do with it. I even used up a full magazine to avoid the Doctor blabbing. - The Doctor has always been extremely resilient. But this is the first time he's done us any favors. What now? - I've been needing to go for an hour already. His Majesty will have to wait, now's not the time! - How are you, mates? Now that you can't make any more noise, perhaps you'll listen to me? We were never going to return the kid. There's this government, I'll let you guess which one, that is particularly interested in him. This child alone is worth a fortune. Rest assured, we don't wish him any harm. Not here on this boat at least. It's only you we don't want to see anymore. Tonight, on the open sea, we'll throw this crate to the bottom of the ocean. So much for you. You chose your own coffin. I would not like you to think that I'm completely insensitive though. There's someone here who insisted on accompanying you in your ordeal. We thought it our duty to yield to her pleas. Will Your Highness please walk this way? I'm sorry, Gérard. How much longer is it? We leave in 20 minutes, Mr. Siegenzwerk. Have some nerve, okay? Today, I want our local police to match their Parisian colleagues. Remember, the Chief of the Sûreté is overseeing the operation in person. Damn it, shoot on sight. We're leaving immediately! Faster, you imbeciles! We should have been underway already! Hey! Over there! Search the holds. It's over now. Come on. Were you scared? - Oh, I'm used to revolution, so... The ship's log. It's a fake. Where's the real one? The real one, the real one, the real one... Serge Sakhamov, first president of the Republic of Poldavia. This promises to be an exciting read. Ooh, a radio broadcasting system. And the latest model! These gentlemen didn't stint themselves! May I ask you to leave me alone for a moment? Borsak! Borsak! Here. You know, I've been arrested too, in Poldavia. I think you won't get anywhere with that attitude, Mr. Von Krantz. It might cost you dearly. Yes, let them in! No, I don't understand. What? What do you say? Get out. Yes, you, Mr. Inspector. Leave, please. Thank you. Yes, Mr. Von Krantz. I have your papers. Rest assured of that. But I'm not selling anymore. Surprised, aren't you? I found another buyer in New York. They've offered me double. What? You know him very well. You once ruined him. Now he wants payback. And I have a mad desire to attend this shark fight and to see the Baron Von Krantz eaten by a bigger fish than him. Farewell, Mr. Kartenberg. Congratulations. How did you do it? - I looked inside the case. All of Von Krantz' boats are listed in here. At the moment, there's only one anchored in a French port: this one. When you have a boat at your disposition and a kid to hide, where do you put him? I can still teach you a few things, my little brother. Remember, I'm 6 months your senior. - It's intolerable! I want you to call the consul immediately! Come in. - No one has the right to arrest me! Diplomatic passport. - Yes, I know. Another fake. As for your diplomacy, save it for later. You'll need it. Go on, book him. Sir, the journalists are here. I sent for the Parisian press. Show them in, but one by one. And women first. Dear brother, you'd scored a point. Today, it's my turn. We're tied now, so let's share. I'll add this little gem to Your Highness' wedding gift basket. But I'm keeping the papers. Damn, the papers! Looking for these? You were born 6 months before me, true. But you never did much with that head start. - Ladies and gentlemen, keep calm, please! Mr. Chief of the Sûreté, how did you manage this extraordinary crackdown? Come, my dear, come... I'll tell you all about it. Oh, Mr. Chief of the Sûreté! François? François!
