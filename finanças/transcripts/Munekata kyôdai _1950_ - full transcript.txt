THE MUNEKATA SISTERS If you apply coal tar to a rabbit's ear, every day at regular intervals, a cancer is formed. That's what Dr. Yamagiwa said. "I finally created cancer with my own hands" That's what he said when he discovered cancer in the rabbit's ear. Dr. Virchow's stimulation theory was thus proven by Dr. Yamagiwa. That's why cancer patients are not allowed stimulating... food. I have a friend who used to be my roommate. He's suffering from stomach cancer. I told him not to drink whisky. He said: "Forbid me anything except cigarettes." Lately, he's even been drinking. He should have died a long time ago, but he's still all right and won't die any time soon. He doesn't believe me. It's a problem. Hello. How are you, Setsuko? It's been a long time. You're right. When did you arrive? Last night. - With Mariko? - Yes, the two of us. - How's your husband? - Well, thanks. I'm glad. Did you get my letter? Yes, that's why I've come. I understand. It wasn't urgent, though. You're father's doing fine, isn't he? Yes. I spoke about him in my class today, about how hardheaded he is. Maybe that's why he's still alive. Is he dying? - He's not well. - Not well? It's serious. Tell me the truth. Tell me exactly how he is. Setsuko, don't let this get you down, OK? Yes. He's got a year to live, with any luck. My guess is six months. There are exceptions, of course. Does my father know he's going to die? I don't believe so. I haven't told your sister either. He's a good man. And a very good friend of mine. He's been a good father to you two. I don't know any man like him. Father, the well is very deep. The water's very cold. Do you get up early in the mornings? Yes, very early. I doubt it. I didn't get up early today. I didn't notice Setsuko leaving. She didn't want to take you because you're a tomboy. She should have woken me and taken me with her. Hello, good afternoon. - Hi! How are you? - Fine. Sit down. - Is she Miss Mariko? - Yes she is. Mariko, do you remember Mr. Tashiro? Yes. She's a woman now. We met in Manchuria. That was a long time ago. I was in junior high school. Before leaving for France? Yes. It was that same autumn. Really? - When did you arrive? - Last night. - Alone? - With my sister. I travel to Tokyo sometimes. I wouldn't have recognized her. She looks like a lady but acts like a child. She's always sticking her tongue out. Look. - Where are you going? - To get some tea. Make yourself comfortable. The book you lent me is very interesting. I'm glad. I had already read it once in Manchuria. They said it was interesting, but I didn't think so at the time. - Nevertheless, now I do. - I'm glad. - Have you brought hot water? - Yes. It's a beautiful day. Ask him to take you somewhere. Why don't you come to Kobe? - Do you live in Kobe? - Yes. - What do you do? - I make home furnishings. - Furnishings? - Chairs and tables. "Furniture" You can speak English if you like. She likes it. Again with the tongue. Will you stick it out? Probably getting ready to do it. She seems determined to restrain herself. Well, it looks like she's growing up. Setsuko, tea, please. Here. - Is this the Yakushi temple? - Yes. But we saw another one. That was the new Yakushi. I didn't know that. Here, eat something. I like it here. I feel very much at peace. I had already been here. Fifteen years ago. I came with Mr. Tashiro. We had lunch right here. I see. What do you see? Mr. Tashiro influenced you. Really? Think so? I don't like temples. You were impressed by the Buddha statue, though. The one with the dark face? That's because it looked like Mrs. Shinoda. Statues are all the same. Some of them have this pose, others that. But they're all the same. You don't know anything. Shall we go to the Toshodai temple? Again? Why not? It's very near. It'll just be a moment. How boring! Why are there so many temples in Kyoto? Are you staying? Come on. Come on. Welcome to my shop. Was it easy to find? Sure. I knew it was close to the baseball field. - Do you like baseball? - A lot. Well. - Shall we go? - Whenever you wish. It's this way. Come in. It's beautiful! And so nice... - Do you like it? - Yes. There are a lot of pretty things. Where are they from? France. I bought them at an auction in England. I went to the Yakushi temple. You were also there, with my sister. Yes. Do you like statues? No. She's visiting other temples with my father, so I've come here. - I'm glad you did. Where is your wife? Isn't she at home? - I'm not married. - Not married? Really? Really. - Is that true? - Yes. Here. And why aren't you? - What? - Married. Because I don't have a wife. - Do you have a woman? - No. - A girlfriend? - None. - Have you ever had one? - No. Liar. - May I? - Do you smoke? Sometimes. - Don't tell my sister. - All right. I know about your girlfriend. My girlfriend? I read my sister's diary. You read her diary? Don't scold me, I know I shouldn't have. - I know many things. - Like what? It was in 1937. Setsuko was 21 and you were at college. That was long ago. It was snowing. Do you remember that night? "The two of them left the Imperial Theatre. Snow fell silently as they walked along the pit." "He was quiet." You. "So was she." Setsuko. "They were young. They held hands." - We didn't hold hands. - Be quiet. You didn't, but you would have liked to. "They would have liked to walk holding hands eternally." - Isn't that wonderful? - Wonderful. Then he asked: ?Aren't you cold?" She answered: "No." Wrapping herself up in her shawl she said: "Aren't you cold, Hiroshi?" It's a good story. Did you live the experience? "She..." I. "She was inexperienced." "He..." Again, you. - Another story? - Many more. "It was a warm spring night." Another day. "The beach at Yui was calm." - In Kamakura. - Yes. "They were next to each other by the moonlight." Come in. - Hello. - Good afternoon. - Well, you have visitors. - Yes. This is Miss Mariko Munakata. She's that woman called Setsuko's little sister, isn't she? - So she is. - Well. I'm Yoriko Mashita. How are you? Won't you sit down? I just passed by on my way to work. - What did you want? - Nothing important. Here, a ticket for the concert on the thirteenth. Well, thank you! A Bach concert. They say it's very good. Meet me at the Alaska. Don't be late, OK? - Goodbye, good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Goodbye. Tell your boss to call me after the guest has left. - All right. - Don't forget. And what happened later in Kamakura? - Who's that woman? - I met her in Paris. Is she married? She was, but she's a widow now. And what does she do? She's a stock broker, in Osaka. "It was a romantic night in Paris" No romantic nights. We were just friends. "He denied being intimate with her." - I don't like that woman. - Why not? She's arrogant. She's not. I hate her. She has the scent of a secret. - Father, are you tired? - No, I'm feeling great. I like the Moss Temple. Besides, the moss was prettier than ever today. There was also a camellia tree. Did you see it too? I thought so. There's real beauty in old Japan. But some people say that traditional things are bad. They're ignorant people. Aren't you drinking too much, father? - Just a bit more. - I think you should stop now. Why is Mariko taking so long? Isn't she coming? I told her to come here. She doesn't like old Japan. It looks like your sister is making you worry. - Don't worry; she's behaving rather well. - I'm glad to hear that. The worst thing is that your husband is out of work. You're going through a bad time. - Is he still loafing about? - No, he's looking for a job. - Tell me, how's your bar doing? - So, so. Holding out. - Can you keep it? - Yes. It's all right, then. You can sell the house in Tokyo. But, father, when you return to Tokyo... It doesn't matter. I'll stay here, in Kyoto. Father... I'm not ever going back to Tokyo. I know I'm dying. Today, I was at the Moss Temple for the last time. I like camellias. . Mariko. - Here you are. - Thank you. - When did you get back, Mariko? - A few days ago. - Did you like Kyoto? - No. I prefer Kobe. What do you think of this one? Think I should have it made? I don't think it will suit you. Too many drapes. - Well, I think so. - You should consider your size. You're wide at the hips. I've heard complaints about you. Who? Your husband? The cat was on my sweater, so I grabbed him and threw him out. Your husband had thrown my handbag before that. It was on top of his table. Reprisals. He should have asked me if I had enjoyed my trip. - Good evening. - Hello, good evening. Sorry I'm late. Can I have some water? - Yes. What did the landlord say? - He wants us to leave. - Really? That's what he said. Mr. Mimura was here. My brother-in-law? Here? What did he want? I don't know. He didn't speak. He just stood there for a while and then left. What time was it? I was about to close the bar. It was raining. - He was very pale. - Like a ghost? Doesn't scare me. Who is it? Mariko. Are you finished with the paper? Not yet. Here. Is it urgent? - What? The bar. Will you have to close it? We've asked the landlord to wait a little longer. Have you told your husband? Yes. And what did he say? It would be terrible to lose it. Give me that handkerchief. He told you to do whatever you want, didn't he? - Going out? - Yes. - Where are you going? - Nowhere. - Here. - I don't want it. - Goodbye. -Goodbye. He gave the cat some milk this morning. And I wanted to fix myself a hot chocolate. Don't complain, you always forget to drink your milk. - When do you think it started? - What are you talking about? - He's changed. - Changed? - He's stingy now. - That's understandable. He's bitter because he's jobless. I don't think so. I don't think it's that at all. What, if not that? Remember that night he came home drunk? It was in May. That's when it started. Sister, your husband read your diary. That's the reason. I'm sure. The day before I had gone up to his room. He said: "Mariko, what are you doing here? And hastily hid the book he was reading. It was a yellow book. How do you know it's my diary? Yes, I'm sure it was your diary. You haven't read it, have you? Why did you read my diary? It's a sin! I wanted to know what you did at my age. I don't care, it's just an old diary. Besides, I did nothing wrong, why should I worry? But, what would your husband think of Hiroshi? - What could he think? - You walked with him in the snow. You loved him, didn't you? Why didn't you marry him? Why? I didn't know. When I realized I loved him, I was already engaged to Mimura. You could have canceled the engagement. Perhaps, but Hiroshi was in France at the time. - What? - Women are all the same. - Not at all! - Of course they are. Even if they might look proud, they're all still waiting to be kissed. - I wasn't waiting for anything. - Of course you were. - You all do it. - Really? Another round. - Come on. - Coming! - How did it go? - I was unlucky the other day. What do you think of this sak?? It's a new brand. Good, isn't it? - I prefer the other one. - Well... - Here. - Thanks. - Do you like cats? - Yes. I hate them. They're selfish and ungrateful. Dogs are loyal. I like dogs. I like cats for those reasons. You're very strange. - I like you too. - Don't say that! I'm grateful. Are you? - Are you grateful? - Well, yes! All right, I'll kiss you. What are you saying? Are you mad? He's got a beautiful wife. I'll tell her. - There's also a young girl. - Yes. - Is she her sister? - Yes - They're very beautiful. - She's too good for you. Seriously? Too good? Of course she is. Too good, eh? . You can go home. Yes? - Mieko is not coming tonight. - Are you also going home? No, not yet. All right. - Here's the key. - Fine. - Good night. - Thank you. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Hello. Good evening. I knew you'd come tonight. I read the letter you sent Mariko. I arrived this morning. How are you? Fine, thanks. I didn't get to see you when you were in Kyoto. I was very disappointed. I was talking with your father yesterday. You're very kind to him. He should be very pleased. Sit down. - It's been a long time. - Very long. - You haven't changed a bit. - Really? Six or seven years. The last time we saw each other was in Yokohama. When I returned from France. You haven't changed at all, Setsuko. Really? It's you that hasn't changed. You still have that habit. This one? You always said that. - I see you're still wearing that ring. - Yes. You said that I was too young for the ring. Now I'm old. My mother died at my age. Excuse me, I'll get you something to drink. Thanks. - Isn't Mariko here? - She's stopped working here. Why? Do you like beer? - Yes. Have you acquired the habit of drinking? Yes. You used to get drunk very easily. I'm glad to have seen you tonight. And don't worry, I'll finance you. No, it's too much to ask. Don't worry, I can help you. Send my regards to Mimura. Goodbye. Hello, welcome. Thank you. I'm glad to see you. When did you get here? Half an hour ago. Did you go to the bar? - Yes, and you weren't there. - I went to the ballet. Really? How long will you stay? - Don't know, a few days. - I'd like to go out and have some fun. - Let's go out, then. I'm broke. Will you invite me? - Sure, of course. - OK, great! - Welcome, sir. - Hello. There was a call for you just after you left. - Who was it? - From Hakone. - From Hakone? - Yes. It was a lady named Mashita. She said she'd call back. All right. Who's that Mrs. Mashita? It's Yoriko, right? Yes. And why is Yoriko in Hakone? - I know everything. - What do you know? Your meeting with Yoriko in Hakone. - I'm not going. - Really? - Really. - Are you serious? I am serious. I know everything. You must have a date with her. - "He mistrusts her." - You're mistaken. - "But she doesn't believe him." - Do you want one? "He tries to bribe her." "She almost accepts the bribe, but a cigarette is not enough." And what then? "It's hard to say." You're impossible. "He doesn't know how to hide the fact." I'm not hiding anything. - Really? - Really. Are you serious? Phone. - Yes, I'll get it! - Mariko... Yes? Yes? Yes. It's Yoriko. Yes. Yes, Mr. Tashiro returned, but he's left again. What's that? Yes, he said he was going to Karuizawa with a client. Come on, Mariko! Yes, that's it. He didn't leave any message. Yes. Yes. I'll tell him you called again. That's that. Mariko, it could have been a business call. If it had been business, she would have come here. "He's in a spot, a very tight spot. "He smokes, but tobacco isn't good." You win, I give up. "He finally decides to surrender, the poor guy." - Yes, I've lost. - Then you're forgiven. - But you must obey me. - Yes. One: don't go to Hakone. Two: don't call her. - Three:... - More? You have to go out with Mariko. She's very hungry. Invite her to dinner. All right? All right. "And he invites the girl to dinner." Will you stay waiting for your guest? No, it doesn't matter. I'll return to Kyoto tonight. OK. Anything else? - Nothing else. Who is it? Mariko? - Yes! Can I lock the door? - No, not yet. Who's coming? - Your husband? - Yes. - He's late. - So are you. What were you doing out on the street at this time of night? Today is my free day. Not just today. You've stopped working. I've been with Hiroshi. Staying at home isn't fun! Mariko! You're drunk. Where have you been? We saw a movie. A movie so late? I met the waiter. He was with a friend and I stayed with them. You like to go out, don't you? - Of course. - Why? Because staying at home makes me sick. I don't want to see Mimura. Mariko, I know how you feel, but don't get nervous. You make him nervous too. And what should I do? - Try to be calm. I'm trying. It's not my fault. - But we live together. - You don't say? Then maybe he should try too. He should try to be nice to us. - He's unemployed. - He should look for a job! He's waiting for a job to come to him. He goes out every day and comes back drunk. He has no right to treat us this way. He has no right to make us both nervous. Mariko, what's wrong? I also have a lot of things to tell you. You can't put up with him forever. He'll never understand how you feel. You're wasting your life. Mariko, you don't understand. Life as a couple is not like that. You can't be happy always. Sometimes we have to learn to be patient. That's the way marriage is. Then marriage is no good. It's good. It'll be good. That's what you think. I don't like it. That's life. You're old-fashioned. What? Old-fashioned. You're old-fashioned. Mariko, I'm old-fashioned? Tell me, what's modern? Are you modern? Don't you think you're old-fashioned? I'm asking you. You like to visit temples and gardens, for example. Is that outdated? Is it wrong? I think that "being new" is "not getting old" Things that are really new, never get old. Do you understand? What does "new" mean to you? Short skirts? Stylish nail polish color? You like it today because it's "new", but tomorrow it'll be "old". Like the waiter. Some years ago he was a kamikaze pilot. Now he loves to dance and play. Is he "modern"? But that's the way life is. Does it seem good to you? Good or not, it's the way we have to be or we won't be fashionable. Why worry? I hate it. You and I are totally different. We were raised in different times. I don't believe my way of thinking is bad, even if you don't agree. I'll ask our father for his opinion. Go ahead, you need it. Who's right, Setsuko or I? You've got your personality, she's got hers. It's not about who's right. You do what you think is right. Can I have my own personality? Of course. The war changed many things. Things will improve, you'll see. But being fashion-conscious is boring. Think deep and choose your road. Value your life. How is your sister and her husband? Do they get along well? You know? They don't get along well? Why didn't Setsuko marry Hiroshi? They don't get along well. It's a pity. Mimura has to find a job. Look, Mariko, a warbler. Did you hear it? I like Kobe a lot. When I'm rich, I'll live here. Why? The sukiyaki is good, so is the sak?... - You drink sak?? - Of course. - I love it. - You could have some tonight. I want to get drunk, really drunk. Why? It's fun. The house spins and the street lights move. Have you felt that way? No, not yet. I think it's great. I like merry-go-rounds. Suppose a boy and a girl are in love. What happens if they don't declare their love? They separate. You should have declared yours. Were you referring to me? I still regret it. If my sister had confessed her love, would you have married her? I don't know. It was long ago. You couldn't have forgotten. You were waiting for her to declare her love. "That was his demerit. He was like my sister." Why didn't you tell her you loved her? - Tell me, why didn't you? - I wasn't sure. - Sure of what? - Of being able to make her happy. You're telling lies. I can't believe it. You loved her. Hiroshi is always waiting for a girl's love confession. - That's not true. - Of course it is. That's the way you are. What if Yoriko asks you to marry her? Would you marry her? Would you? "He lacks the courage to propose and also to reject a proposition." "Deep down in his heart, he is still in love with my sister." Why don't you marry me? Please, marry me. Please, do it. I love you! Tell me, will you marry me? Please, marry me! Marry me! Say something! - What's wrong with you? - Marry me! Why? I hate Yoriko! I can't allow her to have you! It would be wonderful if you could marry my sister! You could give her love! But you can't love Yoriko! I hate her! Marry me! Marry Mariko! Please! You don't know what you're saying! I do! I want to marry you! Don't say that! You'd hate yourself! - I wouldn't! I wouldn't! - Don't say that! You'll leave me because I heard what you said! Think about it! You don't want to marry me! What you're saying is childish, Mariko! Do you think I'm joking? That I'm lying? All right! All right! I'll cry! Mariko! Mariko! Mariko! The lady is coming. Welcome to my house. When did you come to Kobe? - A few days ago. - I'm glad to see you again. Please, sit down. You're as pretty as usual. Have you come with your sister? - No, just myself. - Really? Welcome to Kobe. I was just with Hiroshi. - I proposed marriage. - Proposed to whom? - To Hiroshi. - You? Yes. My sister loved him long ago. I want to marry him for her. You're a funny one. What will your sister say? She'll be pleased. Really? Pleased? You don't think so? - I'd like to think so. But I'm sure it won't be that easy. Then, convince him to marry me. - I could do it. - Please, do it. Promise me. I'll do what I can. Sure? Will you? Yes. I'll try. Seriously? What do you see in Hiroshi? Why do you like him? Tell me. - He's gentle and kind. - Is that all? He's also clean and rich. Well. He's got a lot of virtues. There's just one thing about him that I don't like. And what's that? He's got a friend I don't like. Is it that bad? You know her very well. Really? Yes. She's a horrible person. I hate her. I hate her. Water. Here. - And Mariko? - She's gone out. I have to go to the bar. Do you need anything? Did you sew the shirt button? How's the bar doing? - What? - The money problem. It's solved. Did you get financing? How? They lent me the money. - Who? - Mr. Tashiro. - Was he here? - Yes, the other day. - When? - Twenty days ago. Here you are. How will you return it? - In monthly installments. - Installments? - Yes, he gave me that option. - Can you do it? Yes, I'll manage. Why didn't you tell me about it? Why? I don't know... Why? Because it was Tashiro? No, it wasn't that. Why, then? Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you say anything? Because you didn't want me to know? It's not that. Why didn't you tell me? Why not? I'm sorry. Has he been here often? No. - Have you seen him often? - No, just once. Liar. How could you ask for money? - But... - But what? Don't lie to me. Did Tashiro have any reason to lend you money, then? No reason at all. He didn't have to do it. He just wanted to help me solve the problem, that's all. And what do you know? I know. Hiroshi is not the kind to take advantage. He's kind. He felt sorry for me. Are you defending him? Why do you say that? Why? Do you by chance believe I'm having an affair with him? Do you believe I've betrayed you? Do you think Tashiro and I are lovers? Well, you're wrong! Totally wrong! I'm faithful to you! I'm not doing anything against you! You have to believe me! I would never dishonor your name. I'm sorry. I'll close the bar. Who asked you to do that? We don't need the bar to live. I can work as a seamstress. You're proud of supporting me, aren't you? No. My father said that we could also sell this house. I'll refuse Mr. Tashiro's help. Do whatever you want. You have a visitor. Who is it? Hello. Welcome. How are you? - I went out on an errand. - Come in. Did I surprise you? I'm not in love with you anymore. No? It was just a performance and you rejected me. I didn't. Yes. I discovered something. What? Hiroshi, you're deeply in love with my sister. - How do you know that? - Because you didn't say you loved me. - You were just acting the part. - Sure, but part of it was real. Yes, I'm ashamed, but it doesn't matter. - My sister wants to see you. - Me? - She's got problems. - Why? - She's going to close the bar. - Why? Because her husband meddled in her affairs. - You have to help her, Hiroshi. - What can I do? Talk to her. The sooner, the better. Go see her today. - Where? - Anywhere. You tell me. How about Hibiya Park, at three? Yes. It's wonderful. "He and she will meet at Hibiya Park." Be there. "He'll say to her. Setsuko, don't close the bar. Keep it open. I'm with you. Don't worry." Say that, OK? Sure? Promise me? "They're together, one besides the other..." Come on, Maejima, drink with me! - I am drinking. - Drink some more! Come on, kamikaze! Not drinking any more? I'm sorry we have to close the bar. That's life. But it's a good bar, Mariko. Stop whining! Behave like a good kamikaze pilot! Drink up! You too, Mariko. Wait! Everything's spinning. - So what? Drink up. - Easy does it. You haven't read Hamlet, have you kamikaze? "To drink or not to drink, that's the question." Listen, ex-pilot. Tell me. You're outdated. You love "mahjong". I'll tell you something. What is it? To be modern means not growing old despite the years. It's hard. Understand? I understand. No, you don't understand. I don't either. So, you don't understand either. - Closing down tomorrow. - Are you still moaning? You should learn to be patient. Really? You scared me. What are you doing here, Mimura? Nothing. Just passing by. Setsuko isn't here. I know. Give me a drink. You can go home, Maejima. Come back tomorrow. - Bye. Good night. - Goodbye. We're closing down the bar tomorrow. So I've heard. Why can't Setsuko keep the bar? You wanted her to close it, didn't you? No, not me. - You know how she's suffering. - I don't. You always make her suffer. You're strange. You're her husband. You're too selfish. Selfish? Yes, selfish. I feel sorry for Setsuko. But, Mariko... But what? Forget it. No! You have to find a job so your wife doesn't have to support you! But I can't find a job. Of course you can, it's just that you're not looking! Try it and you'll see how you find one! It's not so easy. Why? Any job is good. Then she'll be proud of suffering for you. That's marriage. Seriously? Then it's better for you to stop being her husband. You mean to grant her a divorce? Yes! - I understand. Divorce? - Yes, divorce! All you do is loaf around and drink! But loafing around and drinking is good, better perhaps than being a husband. There are more interesting things. It will all finish... tomorrow. . - Who is it? - Me. It's a beautiful day. Our neighbor had a baby last night. It's a girl. We'll buy her a gift. What will we get her? - Listen to me. - Yes? - What do you think? - About what? About us. Do you want a divorce? What do you mean? You don't love me. What do you mean? Divorce me. Why are you suddenly saying this? Suddenly? It's not sudden. You've wanted it for a long time. Me? Yes, you. I'm trying to please you. I'm just trying to please you. Why? Why? Ask yourself that question. I hate to say it. What do you mean? You know. What is it? What is the reason? What are you trying to tell me? Tell me! Say it out loud! It's easy! You want a divorce. You think I want a divorce? Is that what you've been thinking? Is that what you've been thinking about me? It's very cruel of you! Just think how I feel! I've never thought about divorce! Never! Why have I suffered so much? Divorce would destroy me! When did you start thinking that way? When did you start? A long time ago! Long ago? I didn't know! I trusted you! I knew why you were mean to me! I thought that some day you'd understand! But you suddenly say that...! Don't cry! I don't believe you! What do you think I've done? Say it clearly! Come on, say it loud and clear! How could you say that to me? I hate you for that! I hate you! Sister! Sister! What's wrong? Did he hit you? Why? Why did he hit you? You don't deserve this! How dare he! Easy, Mariko! I'm going to divorce him! I'm going to divorce him! - Get divorced? - Yes. - Seriously? - Yes. Good! You're doing the right thing! You have to do it! Divorce him, sister! That man doesn't deserve you! He doesn't deserve you! You've been suffering for too long. Yes. I've wasted time and effort. No, I wouldn't say that. Maybe others can't tell, but suffering has benefited you. Suffering has helped to turn you into a great woman. Do you really think so? I'll tell Mimura for you. You better return home today. - Yes, I will. - Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. Come back tomorrow. Come back with me. I'll handle it. Your father will approve. - We'll tell him about us. - Yes, he'll approve. Please, tell him. Tell him. - Hello. It's been a long time. - Hello, sit down. Excuse me. Yes, it's been a long time. Since when? The last time was in Manchuria, on a beach. That was long ago. I like the beach. There was a Russian girl named Natasha. Yes, she played the accordion. She had these huge eyes. She was beautiful. I have to tell you something. - I want to speak to you too. - All right, say what you want to say. I've finally found a job. I'd been looking for a long time. Really? It's a dam building project. I'm an engineer. Great, isn't it? It's on the Kumano river. It's a great job for a man. I'm glad to hear it. Now I'm fine. A man must have a job, or he starts imagining things. I'm fine. Today I'm fine. I'd like to drink to that. Well, let's drink to that. - I'll ask for the drinks. - No. I'll get them myself. I'll get them. I'm glad he's found work. Come here, Setsuko. I'll tell him. The sooner the better. Here you are. - Where's my guest? - He's gone. - Gone? - Yes, he just left. Pour me another one. You've drunk too much. Well, I want more. I'm fine. We're out of liquor. I feel splendid. I don't. It's very late! Your beautiful wife must be worried! You're impossible! Sir. Sir! - What? - Go back to your beautiful wife. Did you hear me, sir? All wives are stupid. Sir! Listen. They're just tools. Like a doorbell. Or a washing machine. Just tools. Do you understand? I agree, sir. You too! Go home! Why? - What do you care? - Of course I care! I don't. Don't be mean. Er, sir. I agree with you. Last year, I lost my first wife. I thought I'd stay a widow, but I married her sister. Then I found out. I can never know what she's doing behind my back. The night before last I went to Ikebukuro. I had some business to take care of. Do you know the "tempura" house in the alley? There's a mailbox on the corner. Hey, sir! You leaving, sir? Hey, sir! You should go too. You'll miss the last train. All right, I will. Tell me, what was wrong with him? Did his wife flee? - Whose wife? - That man's. You're drunk. What was that? Mariko, go have a look. Sister. Sister! Sister! How can a man die so easily? So suddenly? Well, Our father said: "A cripple like me is still alive, while a man who still had a lot to live is dead." He cried on his bed last night. Did you notice? - But I can't believe it. - Why? He suddenly found a job. He'd been looking for one a very long time. What do you think killed him? The doctor said it was a heart attack. A heart attack. Why not? He drank too much. He asked for it. Don't imagine things. Do what you want. You're free. You can do whatever you want. Our father said you could go your own way. Go with Hiroshi. You love him. He's waiting for you. - So, it was a heart attack. - Yes. - Had he been ill? - No, it was a sudden thing. I understand. I feel sorry for poor Setsuko. She'll be alone. All alone. It happened to me too. But I'm used to it now. She'll need someone she can trust, like you. I understand. I felt very lonely too. - This is goodbye. - Why? I've been thinking lately. I won't see you again. Why? I'm temperamental. Perhaps I'm being true to myself when I sway from side to side. Yoriko! Goodbye. "Adieu". Remember, Setsuko? We were here once. Returning from the Horyu temple. Yes, we took some pictures there. I was wearing a purple kimono. Yes. That was fifteen years ago. We had high hopes then. - Sit down, please. - Thanks. - We ate here, remember? - Yes. - Time flies. - That's right. But nothing has changed here. - Hiroshi. - Tell me. I've been thinking a lot these days... About what? I don't think Minura's death was accidental. I'm sure it was on purpose. Why? I think he planned it. He knew I was about to leave him. He's cast a dark shadow over my heart. The shadow is taking over me. It's watching me from somewhere. I can feel its glare. I can't get rid of the shadow. I can't... marry you with... that shadow inside me. - But, Setsuko... - No, I can't. Of course you can marry me. Come with me. I've loved you for so long. I'd almost given up. Now we have the chance. No. Listen, Hiroshi. The shadow that's invading me would overcome you. No, that's not true. Setsuko... Say no more. I've made up my mind. Let me go my own way. Please. I can't marry you. I'm selfish. Forgive me. I don't think I'd be unhappy. I could see you again. I loved you. That was good enough. It made me happy. Event though I might not see you again, I'm happy. Setsuko, I'll be waiting for you. I'll wait for you until you're ready. Forever. I don't deserve it. I'll be waiting. It'll be a long wait. When will I be ready? You'll always find me waiting. And some day... Goodbye. Thank you for being so good to me for such a long time. Setsuko... Sorry I'm late, Mariko. Isn't Hiroshi with you? What's wrong? Did you see him? Was he glad? What did he say? What's wrong? Listen, Mariko. I've said goodbye for good. Why? Why? I felt I couldn't marry him. You might scold me, but I'm going my own way. But... It's what I want to do. I'm being true to myself. I'm contented. But, sister... I'm fine. I've realized that what's important is not lying to oneself. So things are fine this way. Don't you think? I wouldn't say that. You're that kind of woman. We're different. Let's go for a walk. By the palace. Look, Mariko. Kyoto's mountains are purple. I wonder why. So they are. Like plums. How beautiful.
