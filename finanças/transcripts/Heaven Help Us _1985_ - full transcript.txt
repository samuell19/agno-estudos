Yes, Brother Thadeus. You went to St. Mary's up at Boston, correct? Yes, sir. Yes, Brother Thadeus. I'm glad you're amused, Mr. Dunn. It isn't often my students find me so. You served on the altar up at St. Mary's. Fine, you will continue to do so here. We still do the Latin Mass, so brush up on your Latin. Yes, Brother Thadeus. Don't interrupt, Mr. Dunn. Speak when directly addressed or questioned, understood? Yes, sir. Yes, Brother Thadeus. Now, I want you to tell me in your own words what you expect to gain from your experiences here at St. Basil's. To learn? I asked for a statement, not a question, Mr. Dunn. To try and do my best. You must do better than try. You must succeed, Mr. Dunn. Yes, sir. Yes, Brother Thadeus. Right, yes, Brother Thadeus. Yes what, Mr. Dunn? Yes, uh... I don't know, Brother Thadeus. Yes, I will succeed, Brother Thadeus. Yes, I will succeed, Brother Thadeus. Good. I wanted to talk to you about Sister St. Luke. She's been up at St. Mary's for a long time. Brother Thadeus-- Don't interrupt, Mr. Dunn. And don't do that thing with your collar. Sister St. Luke and I go back a long way. Do you know Sister St. Luke, Mr. Dunn? Yes, sir. Yes, Brother Thadeus. Yes, Brother Thadeus. How is Sister St. Luke, Mr. Dunn? She's dead, Brother Thadeus. You may go, Mr. Dunn. Next time I see you, you will be dressed according to the school code. Mr. Dunn? You forgot to say thank you. Thank you. Brother Thadeus. Brother Thadeus. Hey, you're not really going to keep those, are you, Brother? You want them back, Rooney, you got to win them back. Well, Brother, you got my Mickey Mantle. Do I? Oh, right, the Mick. Thank you. Excuse me, Brother. Brother Thadeus wants to know when you intend to call the boys to order. Sorry. You new? Yes. I'm supposed to go to this room here. Right, this is on the first floor at the end of the hall on the left, I think. I don't know. I'm new here too. Follow them. Thanks. Yesterday's assignment covered the chapter on the Holy Trinity. If you'll kindly take out your papers, please. I didn't ask anyone to speak, Mr. Rooney, but since you're in the mood, perhaps you would care to recite from your paper. The Holy Trinity is a total mystery. Therefore, it cannot be understood. Brilliant. But I wanted the definition that's in the book. Oh, right, the book. The Holy Trinity is, was, and always will be total mystery that can't, never could, and never will be understood. Mr. Rooney, do you have some sort of an emotional attachment to this school? No, Brother. Well, then, why, in your second year in this grade, are you laying the groundwork for a third? Remain standing, please. How about the new boy? Mister, um... Dunn. Mr. Dunn. Can you enlighten Mr. Rooney? No, Brother, I can't. Very well, but there will be no excuses tomorrow. All right, Caesar. Brother, before I read my definition, I'd like to preface-- What are you chewing? It's gum, Brother. Stick it on the end of your nose, please. And you will leave it there for the remainder of the day. Yes, Brother, may I-- Sit down! All right, Mr. Rooney, come up here and bring that piece of paper with you. Your homework seems to have disappeared, Mister. I realize that this was a religion assignment, but I hardly expected you to perform a miracle. Is that possible, Mr. Rooney? Is it possible that a miracle has actually occurred? Or is it more likely that you were trying to deceive me? No, Brother. Well, then, what's the explanation? Well, I-- You were trying to deceive me, weren't you? No, Brother. The truth, Mister. You were trying to deceive me, weren't you? Yes, Brother. And now you're sorry, aren't you? Well, then say it. Say "I'm sorry, Brother." "I'm sorry, Brother"! "I'm sorry, Brother." I'm sorry, Brother. Eat up, Mister. Welcome to St. Basil's. You're holding up the line, young man. Can't decide? Oh, I've decided all right, Dunn. I've decided I'd rather die than eat this crap. Looks kind of crowded. Mind if I sit with you? Sure. You'll find plenty of seats around me. Oh, yeah? Why? It has something to do with my IQ, Dunn. You see, when one is in the presence of a superior being, one naturally feels inferior. Hey, Caesar, you fat faggot, you always wear gum on your nose? I take a certain pride in the fact that I've never let my intercourse with the faculty degenerate into any physical violence. Which is no mean feat when you consider the mentality around here is inspired by the Spanish Inquisition. Here. Thanks, Dunn. And then, for insurance, I carry a note. What note? It's from my uncle. He's a doctor. The note says I'm subject to seizures. It's a crock, of course, but it keeps me from having my character built. What's up? It's Williams, probably got caught playing with himself again. Maybe Uncle could write me a note. I'll write you one when I get out of Harvard Med School. You mean you're not going to be a priest? Psychiatrist. I wouldn't save that for later, Dunn. It might start walking. This historic visit will mark the first time that the head of the Roman Catholic Church has come to the United States. The Vatican further announced today that preparations are being made for the Holy Father-- Holy Mother of God. The Italians are coming. Now I know it's the end of the world. You shouldn't talk like that. That's the Pope they're talking about there. He may be the Pope, but he's Italian to me. Boo, stop playing with my flowers. I'm not playing with them. I'm gathering them. She's got to grow out of this. Don't worry. She'll grow out of it. Put the flowers back, Boo. So, Michael, how's school? It's all right, I guess. The Brothers know their business. Do what they tell you, and they'll turn you into a man. Better, a priest. Martha. And won't your parents be smiling down from Heaven the day you become a priest. Martha, pass the cabbage. Father Dunn. The cabbage, Martha. Bishop Dunn. Boo, tell your grandma to pass the cabbage. Pass the cabbage, Grandma. Pope Michael I. Come on, Boo, off the bed. I died, Michael. Yeah? Well, go die in your own bed. I'm tired. Give me the Last Rites. I'm not a priest. I'll wait till you are. Well, you might wait a lot longer than you think. Where'd you get this? I stole it from Grandma. If she catches you smoking, she'll have a heart attack. If she hears you talking about not being a priest, she'll have a stroke. Michael, study your Latin. Studying, Grandma. Ready? Ready. Okay. Confiteor deo. Confiteor deo. Omnipotenti. Omnipotenti. Beatae Mariae. Beatae Mariae. Semper Virgini. Semper Virgini. Beato Michaeli. Beato Michaeli. Archangelo. Archangelo. Beato Joanni Baptistae. Beato Joanni Baptistae. Sanctis Apostolis. Sanctis Apostolis. Petro et Paulo. If I looked like you, I would shave my ass and walk backwards. Janine! Hey, Janine. Oh, boy. She's hot for me, you know. I made 30 cupcakes, chocolate with vanilla icing. Those are my favorite-- Hey, Janine. Hey, if you go to Loews next Saturday night, why don't you come up to the last row balcony? What for? I'll show you what for when you get there. Oh, yeah, and after that, we'll have to go to confession, right? I hope so. Besides, you know what the penance is for getting felt up in Loews last row balconies, don't you? It's a rosary. Shit, I could do a goddamn rosary standing on my head. You're nuts. What about my nuts? This guy is really sick. It's true, Rooney. You're really sick. Hey, let me buy you a Coke or something. Oh, hot shit. Hey, Saturday night, Janine, last row balcony. Hey, look at these guys. Hey, kid, come here. Come here, kid. I'm not going to bite you. I wouldn't count on it. Here, hold this. It's the St. Mary's fairy. Come here, kid, I want to tell you a secret. Hey, let him go, Rooney, and I'll give you a banana, huh? Hey, shut up, faggot. Quit blocking the stoop, dummy. Hey, why don't you go play your games someplace else, Rooney? Hey, Danni, I want you to meet the St. Mary's fairy. Hey, what do you think? She's cute, ain't she? Let him go. Hey, I think she likes you, man. I said let him go. All right, Rooney, no doggy biscuits. Hey, look, kid, you keep hanging out with that faggot, you're going to start thinking I'm pretty. I told you he would do something dumb. You should have kicked him in the balls. That's what I would have done. You can sum up your experiences with the Rooneys of this world at that one moment when you're gathering your books from the floor. Yeah, where's your books? I carry my assignments like this. Otherwise, I'd end up on my knees like you. Don't worry about a thing, Dunn. I'll have you caught up with your work in no time. Thanks. Listen, why do you let him call you a faggot? Let me tell you something about Rooney. He's just projecting his doubts about his own sexuality. It's typical. Oh, Christ. There's no toilet paper. Hey, Williams, is that you? Yes. Do you have any toilet paper in there? No. Dunn, will you check the other stall? Yeah. Nothing. Look, you better run, or you'll be late. What about you? I'll work something out. Would you pass up your homework assignments, please? Brother Timothy will be observing class today. Take a seat in the back, Brother. All right, let's get started, please. You're late, Caesar. Yes, Brother. Next time, try running. Yes, Brother. One demerit. Do you have your homework assignment? No, Brother. You didn't do your homework assignment? I did my homework assignment, Brother. I just misplaced it. No homework assignment? Two demerits. Sit down. Sue that janitor. By nowyou should all have a copy of David Copperfield. Anyone who doesn't, speak now-- You'll pay for that, Caesar. But, Brother, my screws are gone. Bring your desk up here, Mister. Where are your screws, Caesar? I have no idea, Brother. All right, who did it? Who took the screws? On your knees, all of you. And you will remain on your knees until the joker comes forward. I tried to warn you. You, Mr. Dunn. Stand up, please. Perhaps you would care to share your comments to Mr. Caesar with the rest of the class. I said I was sorry I didn't tell him that he didn't have any screws, Brother. Come up here, Mr. Dunn. Did you take Caesar's screws, Mr. Dunn? No, Brother. Do you know who did? No, Brother. Mr. Dunn, there's something you should know about me. I'm not a man who enjoys violence. In fact, I find I get much better results when I use patience. And this, Mr. Dunn, is patience. Now, I think you know who took Caesar's screws and to who you would have to answer. It's "to whom," Brother. What? It's "to whom," Brother, as in "to whom he would have to answer." Now, do you know to whom you will have to answer for interrupting? To you, Brother. Right again. Hands and knees, Mr. Caesar, up and down the aisle. Let's hear it, Mr. Caesar. To whom, Brother. To whom, Brother. Mr. Dunn, who took the screws? I don't know, Brother. Brother, maybe I should come back some other time. Oh, no, please stay. I'm about to show you how patience triumphs over impudence. To whom, Brother. Hold out your hands, please, Mr. Dunn. To whom, Brother. To whom, Brother. Who took the screws? Who took the screws? Point him out, Mr. Dunn. All right, that's enough. Well, Brother, is there anything else you'd like to show me? Paper says it may rain this afternoon, Mr. Rooney. Do you think Brother Paul will call off track and field? I don't know, Brother. Thadeus. If he doesn't, we'll be missed out there. Come in. You wanted to see me, Brother? Yes, let's step outside. Get off the wall, Mr. Dunn. Keep an eye on those boys, Brother. Dunn, how you doing? Hey, look, man, I really appreciate the way you held out for me like that. I never expected you to take so much. Man, all I remember was that look on Constance's face when you jumped me. That goddamn faggot, Constance. He never expected you to do something like that. Oh, man, my goddamn arms are killing me. How about you? Fuck this, man. I'm putting my arms down for a while. Hey, so listen, Dunn. After all this, you won't have to hang out with that faggot, Caesar, anymore. I mean, you can hang out with the regular guys. You know what I mean? Drop dead. I thought I was going to learn something about running a class. But instead, I was offered a demonstration in brutality. The man seemed to be enjoying himself, Brother. That's a rather slanderous thought, Brother, one that really ought to be kept to oneself. Brother Constance is an effective teacher, one of the best we have. I hear you, Brother, but, uh-- But what? We all come to the order full of ideas. But after a while, we often find that we have much to learn ourselves. In any event, authority must never be undermined by displays of dissention among the faculty. For the students' sake, you understand. No, I don't understand. Then you should try to restrain yourself until you do. Hey, Dunn, where you going? I'm going home. Hey, why don't you hang out for a while? Get lost, huh? Hey, look, Dunn. You jumped me in front of everybody. You made me look pretty stupid. I got to save face. If I don't make you my friend, that means I got to kick your ass every time I see you. Now, nobody wants that to happen, right? So what do you say, huh? Let's give it a try. Come on. You know, Dunn, I always liked you. Hey, Danni, getting any lately? Danni, come here a minute. Williams has something for you. I got something for him. How's it hanging, Williams? Hey, Rooney, how's it going? Hey, over here, Dunn. I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees. Well, I guess you'd say. Hey, Danni. Hey, where's your old man? How come I haven't seen him lately? You want something? Yeah, I want you, babe. Order something or get lost, okay? All right, get me a pack of Luckies and a Coke for my new friend here. My treat. Hey, Dunn, do not waste your time with her. She's just 100% frustrated from spending all her time with her old man. I mean, she never made it with nobody. Not even me, if you can believe that. Don't choke on them. Yeah, yeah, hey, listen, Danni. We're going to be starting the school dances in a couple weeks. How would you like to go with me? Nope. Not even if I get my father's new car and we went driving afterwards? You don't even have a license, Rooney. So what's a license got to do with it? I can drive. Hey, Danni, it's got electric leather seats and windows. What are you trying to do, make me hysterical? 50?. Thanks a lot, Dunn. Thanks. So how about it, Danni, huh? Electric leather seats. I don't want to go to no Catholic dance. I ain't a Catholic. And even if I was, I wouldn't go with a jerk like you even if you were bishop. See, what did I tell you? 100% frustrated. Rooney, my sick friend, got a cigarette for me? Hey, Janine. How would you like to go riding around with me in my father's new car? It depends on who's doing the driving. It's got electric leather seats and windows, Janine. Leather? Electric. Hi. Can I t a pack of Chesterfields, please? Yeah. Got a light? And Rooney-- Rooney, never gamble with what you don't want to lose. Hey, that's deep, Brother. Yeah, well, I'm deep. It's a raid! Hey, where are you going? That's my house through there. Nobody goes through my house. Shit. No, no, no, no, no. You got me, Brother. So what school do you go to? Aw, Christ. Look at this. If they'd just leave us alone. Listen, why don't you just leave, okay? Heads up. I haven't been to school this year yet. I thought they'd come after me. But all they do is send letters. I don't think they care that much. Besides, I can learn more than they can teach me just from reading on my own. Maybe I'll go back someday. Maybe. Okay. You ain't like those other jerks, are you? I don't know. I just got here. Gentlemen, it pains me to tell you this. But of all the Basil boys I've had in this room, this is by far the most physically unfit. Therefore, in keeping with the late great President Kennedy's nationwide physical fitness program, I have decided that, starting today, we'll put away the things of our childhood and begin the work of men. The day is coming, gentlemen, when you will be called upon to defend this country against the communists. And when that-- And when that day comes, you'd better be in better shape than you are right now. The communists are fierce fighters, fanatically dedicated to their cause. And do you know what this cause is? No, Brother. Killing Catholics. Hey, Caesar, you have something up your nose? Not anymore, Brother. Well, how would you like something up there that you can't blow out? Not really, Brother. All right, men, after swim class, we will all assemble in the gym for a period of severe calisthenics. We'll put Constance in the hospital with this assignment, Dunn. He'll be asking religion, and we'll be answering metaphysics. What are you doing? Sorry. You want me to look up something here or what? Oh, go ahead with what you're doing. Do you know that daydreaming relieves the unconscious? It's a common activity among geniuses. Really? Really. It's also common among schizophrenics and fools. Speaking of fools, what are you doing here? Shut up, fathead. I'm here to see Dunn. What's the matter? Thadeus took me off track and field. Why? He heard me call Constance a goddamn faggot when we were kneeling in his office. I don't know how he did it, but he heard me. He's omniscient. Yeah, his mother's probably one too. Anyway, he says I'm off track and field until I go apologize to Constance. So go apologize. Oh, sure, go tell Constance I'm sorry I called him a goddamn faggot. He'll cream my face. But without track and field, my grades will be based on my grades. That means I'm going to be in this goddamn school for the rest of my goddamn life. Sshh! So what are you going to do? I'm going to study. You think that's funny? Caesar, why don't you work with him? Caesar doesn't work with morons. No, hey, Dunn, forget it. I don't need any help. Especially from a faggot like him. Why don't you just work with each other? No! Hey, Caesar. Don't say nothing, man. I don't want nobody to know I'm here. They might get the wrong idea. Hey, listen, I think Dunn's right. I think you should help me. Hey, I'm not saying we have to be friends or anything, strictly business, no strings attached. Hey, maybe I could do something for you too, anything. I just can't afford to get let back anymore. I already got hair on my balls, Caesar. So what do you say, huh? You going to help me or what? Come on, please. Hey, you can still be a faggot as far as I'm concerned. Please, Caesar, huh? Corby, you can't tell him you lied to your father. He'll make you go back and apologize to him. Then he'll break your goddamn legs. Tell him it was a bus driver you lied to, you know, someone you're never going to see again. Right. And what's this, huh? You stole 22 times? What the fuck are you, a goddamn Jesse James? And what did you steal? He's going to want to know. And he's going to tell you to bring it all back. Here, change this 22 to 2 and tell him it was some food or something. What if he wants me to bring that back? What, the crap? And add three lies to the others, but don't tell him it's him you were lying to. You know, like you forgot who it was, then you're home free. Yeah, but that still leaves me with one lie. Yeah, but it's a beautiful trade-off. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been three months since my last confession. Go on. I've lied three times. I've been angry very often. I've shown disrespect to my elders several times. Hey, Williams, you got your list? Yeah. Let's take a look. Jesus, you got here you jerked off 168 times and it's been one month since your last confession. That's an average of-- 5.6 times a day. Oh, my God. You can't tell him that. He'll cut your balls off. Here, make this three jerk offs. Divide the rest into impure thoughts and wet dreams. And add another lie to your list. Check. What kind of magazine? Uh, one with pictures in it. What kind of pictures? Pictures of things, uh, women, Father. And what did you think about when you looked at these pictures? Think about? Did you have any thoughts? Yes, Father. What kind of thoughts? Impure thoughts, Father. I was coming to that sin. When you had these impure thoughts, did you commit impure acts? Yes, Father, I was coming to that sin also. How often did you commit these impure acts? Oh, just once. Just once? You sure about that? I want you to think for a moment. Yes, just once, Father. When you committed these impure acts, did you do it alone or with someone else? Oh, no, alone, always alone. Always? What happened to just once? Oh, I mean just once alone. What's he going to confess? Taking a shit? What is taking so long? Perrin's in there. Perrin the Pervert? Yeah, and Father Abruzzi. Perrin the Pervert and Impure Acts Abruzzi. God, we're going to be here all day. I want you to throw that magazine away. I want you to give the money back to your parents. Oh, no, I can't. You're going to have to. For your penance, say 6 Our Fathers and 12 Hail Marys, and I want you to say Rosary every day for a week. Can you remember all that? Yes. Make an act of contrition. Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of Hell but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, who are all good and deserving of all my love. What? What!? You little weasel. I was only joking. Come on, Father, can't you take a joke? Hey, I got an idea. Keep an eye out for Father Abruzzi. Yeah. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been six weeks since my last confession. Go on, my son. Father, I'd like to confess a sin I thought I could live with. But it's becoming a problem. An impure act? Something much worse. Really? Father, I entered and, typically, won an inter-borough essay contest. I accepted a nominal cash prize, and the article was published in the community paper. Big deal, my son. Father, I failed to footnote some of my sources. Get to the sin, please. Plagiarism, Father. Alone or with someone else? With a girl? I did it myself. Yeah, so? Father, if this is discovered, it could someday keep me out of Harvard. And, Father, I was conceived to go to Harvard. All right, all right, you are forgiven. Do you have any other good stuff, impure thoughts, desires, fantasies? No, Father. What? What kind of a faggot are you, anyway? Dominus vobiscum, shithead. You're going to recite one Our Father, one Hail Mary, and you're going to help your buddy, Ed Rooney, get passing grades, or you can kiss off Harvard, pal. There is no God. Hey, I'm telling you guys: Fast dancing's for faggots, man. Girls fast dance with their sisters. I mean, think about it for a second. Her body, her soft, perfumed, and powdered body leaning against yours. Her legs, her thighs, moving against yours. Her delicate, perfectly formed knobs. Oh, Jesus. Hey, and it's all legal. It is? Yeah. All right! My name is Brother Timothy, and I have been sentenced to preside over this series of dances. First of all, I'd like to welcome the Virgin Martyr girls and thank them for coming. And I have a note to remind you that there will be a First Friday novena this coming Friday. And now let me introduce to you Father Abruzzi, who will be giving the first talk. Thanks. Father. Wait just a second, Father. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. As you know, these dances are designed to help you learn to interact with one another in a way befitting young men and women of a strong moral fiber. You're all at an age now when you're perhaps beginning to notice the difference between the boys and the girls. And just as she is at every other important moment of your life, the Church is here to guide you. Many of you will be experiencing certain feelings, feelings which you might be inclined to confuse with love. But ladies and gentlemen, never confuse love with the deadliest of the seven deadly sins. Lust, ladies and gentlemen, has undone and cast down into the infernal fires of Hell even the most advanced souls. There is a beast living within each and every one of you, a filthy beast, whose name is-- Lust. That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Lust is the beast within you, the beast that wants to consume you and then spit you out into the eternal fires of Hell, where, for all eternity, your flesh will be ripped from your body by grotesque serpents with razor-sharp teeth, where, for all eternity, your blood will boil, your bones will burn, and your marrow will be reduced to a putrid black slime! And for what? For a few moments of weakness that led you to admire the shape of somebody's buttocks. Any questions? Very well, then. Have a nice time. Enjoy the dance. And I'll see you all next week. I did you wrong. My heart went out to play. But in the game, I lost you. What a price to pay. I'm crying. So how come you guys aren't dancing? Caesar doesn't dance. Oh. Guys want anything? Me? No thanks. Caesar hardly walks. What's your excuse? I don't know, waiting for inspiration. Inspiration? Who from, the Holy Ghost? Come on, it's a cinch. You just walk up to some girl you like, you look her in the eye, say, "Excuse me, but you want to dance?" Works every time. Yeah. What if it doesn't? Well, if it doesn't work, then you got to start thinking about joining a religious order. Maybe I'll see you later. Maybe you better start dancing. I'm just about at the end of my rope. But I can't stop trying. I can't give up hope. I'm dying. Baby, baby. Eight fingers, there, Rooney. Eight fingers. Can you still get your father's car, Rooney? Sure, let's go. No, wait, not now. After the dance. And I don't want to go alone. You're not going alone. You're going with me. I mean, we have to take Cathleen with us. What the hell for? Because we came together. All right, I'll get Corby. That slime? All right, I got it. I'll take Williams. You're right. Who then? Give me a name. Who? Over there. Who, him? What, is she weird or something? I think she likes his brains. Hello? Hello? Hello? Danni? Excuse me. I was looking for Danni. What the hell are you doing here? The door was open. I was looking for you. I guess I shouldn't have just come on in, huh? Damn straight you shouldn't have just come in. I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk. Get out of here, okay? Sorry. I just wanted to dance with you. You're still here? Yeah, I guess I am. You want to come in? Nah, I'm going to head home. Come on. Please? Okay. Listen, I didn't mean to yell at you like that. And I'm sorry, okay? Sure, don't worry about it. I just don't like nobody going back there. He's not always like that. My father, he's not always like that. It's just melancholia. What? You know, he's down in the dumps. How come? 'Cause the woman he loved and loved him back killed herself. Your mother? No, not her. She's the reason the woman killed herself. You see, even though my father loved this other woman, he couldn't bring himself to leave my mother. Stupid. Anyway, that's when my father got melancholia. And that got my mother pretty mad, 'cause she knew why he had melancholia, so she left him. How's that for a kick in the head? God. Yeah, God. What's the matter? You smoke or what? What are you smoking my cigarettes for? Sorry. Caesar. What do you think you're doing, Rooney? Tonight's the night, buddy. Tonight's the night for what? Hey, listen, uh, Janine said she'd go riding around with me in my father's new car. Tell her I can recommend a good therapist. Excuse me. Well, listen, Cathleen wants to go with you. Forget it, Rooney. Harvard, Caesar. Harvard. Look, Rooney, I'll help you with your grades. But do you think holding that over my head puts me at your beck and call for life? Yeah. Thank you, God. Are you sure this is okay? Yeah, my father's in Chicago. Pile in. Get the fuck in there. Where's Janine and Rooney? What do you think they're doing? I don't even want to think about it. Where's Cathleen and Caesar? Oh, don't worry about those faggots. They can take care of themselves. Here, take some more. Hey, take a little more. More? Yeah. It relaxes you. Okay. Bye. You know, Janine. I've waited a long time for this. I know you waited a long time too. I know you want it. You won't regret this, Janine. I swear you won't. Oh, God. Oh, God. I really enjoyed that article you had published in the paper. Which one? The one they gave you the prize for. Did you? Yes, I thought it was well-written, entertaining, and extremely enlightening. Did you really? Yes, and I especially liked the way you detailed the split between Freud and Jung. I did do that rather well, didn't I? Well, you see, Freud was sort of an asshole. Well, I mean, to reduce everything that is longer than it is wide to a penis is-- What's that? It's a goddamn boat. What the fuck do you think it is? What's that? Don't you know anything? It's a goddamn bridge answering a goddamn boat. Why would the bridge be answering the boat? So that the goddamn boat knows that the goddamn bridge knows that the goddamn boat knows that the bridge knows the boat is coming through. Goddamn! Fuck, my car. Caesar, open the fucking door. There's a fucking boat coming. I ain't playing around. Open the fucking door, Janine. I'm going to be sick. I don't care. Open the fucking door. What's wrong? Rooney, what's wrong? Rooney, what's wrong? What's going on? Get the fuck off me. Come on, let's get out of here. I can't find my goddamn keys. Damn. Precious and warm a memory through the years. Oh, thank you, God. Thank you. I'll never forget you for this, God. Oh, my God. God, what are you doing? You're fucking me up here, God. Through the years. And I still can see blue velvet... through my tears. Blue velvet. Fuckin' A, man. Janine. Leave her alone, Rooney. Yeah, yeah, hey, listen. What happened to you? My father just got back from Chicago. Hey, listen, I just found out, if you get the Pope to wave at you when you're together, that means you can have sex without sin. Your ass. No, really, because then you're as good as married in the eyes of the church. I mean, why do you think all those Italian guys always cheer every time he waves at them. Up yours, Rooney. And get your stupid face away from me. Hey, see you later, Janine. What are we going to do, sit here all day? You kidding? This is Thadeus' idea of a good time. Yeah, well, the Thad wouldn't know a good time if it slid up his leg and bit him on the patoingas. Where's Rooney? I don't know, Brother. Where's Dunn? Don't worry. Those faggots are never going to know we're missing. What did they do to Elvis, cut his balls off or something? Now that we are one. Miserable. Are you familiar with the word miserable? Well, you will be, because miserable is what I am going to make your miserable lives every miserable minute of every miserable day from now until Easter. Am I making myself understood? Yes, Brother. Yes, Brother what? Yes, Brother, miserable, Brother. What does that faggot Constance have us using these things for? Because he is a sick man. He is sick if he thinks I'm going to do this every Sunday. I got better things to do on my Sundays. Yeah, like taking a drive in the Gowanus Canal. Man, it looks like every bird in Brooklyn took a dump on him. Of all the places there are to drop turds, I wonder why they all pick on the Bas'. Think about it, all right? But work while you thk about it. There's the pitch. You know, I can't figure out how a guy like you ever became a Brother. What do you mean, a guy like me? Take a look around. There's all kinds of different guys here. What's wrong with me? I don't know. I just can't figure it out is all. Well, a lot of people can't figure it out. My brother was supposed to be the one with the vocation. Me, they had me written off as the bum. But here I am, wearing a robe, bouncing a ball on the steps of the rectory. Is your brother a bum? Sort of. He sells life insurance down in Maryland. Come on. Yeah, everybody's got it all figured out for me too. Ever since I was a kid, they've been telling me I'm going to be a priest. If my grandmother has her way, I'll be Pope. Just be sure to remember all us little guys down here when you're up there in the Vatican. So you're a working girl, too, eh? Isn't that nice, now? Isn't that nice, hmm? Pass the potatoes. Michael's going to be a priest. Great. Your grandparents seem like nice people. Yeah, my grandma's not used to having kids around, so it's weird for her. She's all right. You're going to be a priest, huh? Why, you want my blessing? Sure. There's my bus. Yeah. Uh, listen, you still want to dance with me? Sure. Okay, someday, when the weather breaks, I'll take you down to the beach, to the Bop House. Great, I don't dance too good. I'll teach you how to dance, Father Michael. Aw, fuck. Dunn, this is the greatest day of my life. Hey, Willie. Give me some change? How's it going? Ah, spring has sprung. Got a good summer coming too. Good summer coming. Hey, how about you? You being good? Trying. You better. Friend of yours? Yeah. Kind of dead around here now. In a couple weeks, it'll be jumping with every party-head in Brooklyn. That's okay. I'm not too crazy about crowds. Yeah, but on summer nights, with the lights and stuff, people dancing, it's like a whole other planet, whole other weird, fantastic planet. I've been loving you too long to stop now. You are tired. You want to be free. My love is growing stronger. as you become a habit to me. Ooh, I've been loving you a little too long. I don't wanna stop now. With you, my life has been so wonderful. I can't stop now. You know, lots of times, when you're with somebody, you feel like you've always got to talk to them, you know, I mean, always be saying something, or it starts getting embarrassing. You know? I don't feel that way with you, though. I feel like I don't have to talk, and it's all right. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah? Got something for you. What? Special rock. What's so special about it? What's special about it is, if you have a wish you want to come true, you take that rock and throw it as far as you can into the ocean, and it will come true. Really? I don't know. That's great. Michael. Got something for you. It's a hubcap, '56 Chevy. Keep it. Beauty. Yep. Let's get in. It's getting wet. Come on. I don't want to stop now. Don't make me stop now. Oh, baby. I'm down on my knees. Please, don't make me stop now. I love you. I love you. I love you with all of my heart. And I can't stop now. Please, please, please, don't make me stop now, good God almighty. My heart and soul, I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Good God Almighty, I love you. Hi, Boo. Did you see Grandma? She waited up for you. Yeah, I saw her. She's going to set herself on fire one of these days. Where were you? Out. Out with that girl? Yeah. Do you like her? Yeah. Do you love her? None of your business. Come on, get out of here. I'm tired. It's not my fault you're tired. You're tired because you were out all night with that girl. And you were out all night with her because you do love her. And you're all wet. Michael, you're not going to leave me, are you? Of course not. What are you talking about? You're going to go away with that girl and leave me here with Grandma and Grandpa. Are you going to leave me, Michael? No. I'm not going to leave you. "In that high place in the darkness, "the two oddly sensitive human atoms "held each other tightly and waited. "The mind of each was the same thought. "'I've come to this lonely place, and here's this other.'" I like the part about the two oddly sensitive human atoms. You want me to stop? Hey, all right. Got it. I cannot work in this madhouse anymore. And your book report doesn't sound like David Copperfield. Hey, you know, I think something's going on with those two over there. Never mind that. Let me ask you a question. Why do you keep referring to W.C. Fields? Because he was in it. In what? In the goddamn movie, stupid. You got a couple of smokes? Why me, Lord? Hey, look, it's not my fault you don't know who W.C. Field is, all right? Hey, get your own, huh? Look, I know who W.C. Fields is. Who'd he play in the movie? Hold on. Let me check my notes. See, here he is. He's the guy with the hat. Only they fucked up, because he don't look like W.C. Fields at all. Too skinny. I'll write you a one- and two-syllable version of my own report. You can sign your name on it later. Yeah, but that's cheating. The shitheads are coming! They're taking names! Oh, Margaret. You're creating a famine down at the other end of the table. I don't know who's responsible for this girl. But I think the social welfare people will find this a very interesting situation. She is a juvenile delinquent. She should be arrested and that whole place closed down. Don't you think that's a little extreme? Oh, I forgot. Brother Timothy's favorite hangout. We have a responsibility to take some action here. That girl's undermining everything we try to do. If I were the headmaster-- If you were headmaster, you'd probably call out the National Guard. But at the moment, I'm headmaster. And at the moment, the headmaster is trying to enjoy his dinner. Where has all the bread gone? Ask Brother Dominic where the bread went. Brother Dominic. Where has all the bread gone? Oh, would you be kind enough to pass this down to Brother Thadeus, with my compliments. He buttered it too. I've noticed a marked improvement in most of the work. And in some cases, a miraculous recovery. Yahoo. Yahoo, Mr. Rooney? Certainly your grades indicate that you have the ability to succeed if you'll just apply yourself. But let's save the yahoos until we see how well you do in your other subjects. A minus, Brother? I found your assertion that Charles Dickens was a paranoid schizophrenic slightly hard to swallow. Not to mention irrelevant. A minus. What is this school coming to? Hey, look, if you need some help on your next paper, hey, what are friends for? Hey, Dunn, where you going? Okay, step aside here. We're all set. We'll make arrangements with your mother to have the inventory accounted for. They made this happen, didn't they? Nobody made this happen. I just don't want you to be sad. Because I'm not. Promise? No. We have to go. Hey, listen, um, I'm glad I got to dance with you. Don't worry, Dunn. We'll find her. I can't believe you talked me into this. First thing in the morning, I'm having my head examined. Hey, shut up. We're doing it for Dunn. In the morning, you're going to be glad you did it. You're going to feel like a man. God, who has given you the opportunity for eternal life, has given you this life on Earth, this finite life, this life with a beginning and an end that is measured out in increments of time. Time. Time is a medium of exchange. You can use it. You can purchase things with it. So don't waste your time when you're out of school. Whether it be the Easter recess or the summer vacation, make it a point to spend your time fruitfully. Hey, he's talking to you, get it? Fruitfully? Time will give back to you tenfold what you've given to it. It will make better men out of you. It's time to cheer up Dunn. Don't take that out now, Rooney. Shut up. Dunn, I got a little present here for you, just a little something to put the smile back on your face. You think now that you know everything. But what is ahead for you is extraordinary. And remember, whether you are in school or out of school, you are representatives... Of St. Basil's. You and you and you and you and you. Let's go. And you are charged with upholding the moral character-- Let's go. identified with this school. That's far enough. Against the wall, please, gentlemen. You, too, Rooney. Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen. Is he gone? I think that faggot figured out who did it. Oh, what gives you that idea? What are you going to tell him? Oh, let's see. You're sitting in the assembly with a saint's head in your lap. Tell him you found it in a box of Cracker Jacks. No, that's no good. We've got to think of something better than that. Hey, Williams, what are you doing? Corby, shut up. Williams is playing with himself in here. All right, I got it, listen. This is what we'll tell him when he comes back. We'll tell him-- we'll tell him we don't know what the fuck he's talking about. How is he going to argue with that? Come on, Caesar. We're going to get killed. I've got a note. Well, sure, listen to him. He's got a goddamn note. What about the rest of us, huh? We're all in this together, you know. Hey, Dunn, where are you? Right here. Hey, Dunn, we did it for you, you know. Yeah, I appreciate that. I will appeal to him as one human being to another. I'll reason with him. Oh, sure, you're going to reason with a grown man in a dress? Come with me, please. That's far enough. Thank you, Brother. Gentlemen, we will dispense with the traditional accusation-denial ritual. It's such a bore and not likely to convince me that I don't have before me, right now, at least one, if not all, of the vandals. But, since I'm a just man with no taste for punishing the innocent, I will afford the guilty the opportunity to speak now and to save the innocent from an impending state of wretchedness. Well? Could you repeat that, Brother? Shut up. All right, who did it? Speak now, or you will all suffer for it. I did. Mr. Dunn. He didn't do it. Williams did it. What do you mean, I did it? Corbet did it. No, it was Caesar's idea to take the head off. All right. All right, that's enough! Have it your own way, gentlemen. Mr. Corbet, you will approach the horse, please. Gentlemen, will you turn around, please? Mr. Williams. Mr. Caesar. Brother, I'm exempt from this sort of discipline. The famous note. I see you've had it laminated. To protect it. Very good, I'll return it to you when we finish. Please, Brother, can't we work out another punitive plan, please? Please, Brother, please. This is barbaric. Who are you calling barbaric? You leave him alone. Shit. Holy shit. Come on, Caesar. Never let it be said that one of our boys performed less than admirably on any occasion or displayed anything less than the most noble character in so doing. Let's go. I said let's go. What is this? It's quite all right, Brother. Everything's under control. Bastard! This impudent piece of-- They should be expelled. In the real world, they'd be charged with assault. In the real world, they'd have a case for self-defense. I think expulsion is justified here. No one cares what you think. Fetch the boys in here. Those kids are our responsibility. No one need remind me of our responsibilities, Brother. Can you gentlemen give me a good reason why you shouldn't be expelled? It's my fault, Brother. I'm the one who should be expelled. You all acted as one, Mr. Dunn. And as one, you shall bear the consequences. Yes, Brother, but I started it. Did you? As I understand it, Brother Constance started it. What? I'm suspending you for two weeks. Good day, gentlemen. What do you mean, I started it? They assaulted the faculty. They have disgraced this institution. And they destroyed a statue of St. Basil. I always hated that statue. What is this? I'm having you transferred out of the school. I don't want you working with children anymore. You can't do this. I will demand an investigation. I'll take this all the way to the bishop if I have to. Take it wherever you want, Brother. Just take it out of my office. It appears we have a vacancy, Brother. You think you can fit in? I think so, Brother. I can't tell my father I'm suspended. I'll have to leave the house every morning and pretend I'm going to school. Yeah, so what else is new? I'll never, ever get into Harvard now. I'll have to settle for Queens College. Well, you should feel right at home at Queens College. Guess this means I can't be Pope. Not unless you have three miracles to your credit. I can't believe we're not going to be in this place for two weeks. Yeah! And it's one for the money, two for the show-- In 1966, everybody graduated from St. Basil's. Except me. Caesar went on to graduate with honors from Queens College and became a podometrist or a psychiatrist or some fag job like that. Williams got a job as a projectionist at the Peek-a-Boob Theater in Times Square. Corbet married Janine. Imagine, a turd like him. They have six kids. I heard Dunn and Danni ran into each other at Woodstock at Max What-His-Face's farm, where 1/2 million faggots stood in the rain for three days with no clothes on. Me, I went to beautician school, where everybody graduated except me, but I got a job as a shampoo boy at Maricia's House of Hair in Bensonhurst. The hours suck, the pay sucks, I'm surrounded by funny guys, but the tips are great. Thank you, God. Copyright: 2004 Home Box Office, Inc. Well, you can do anything. But lay off my blue suede shoes. Rock it! Well, it's one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready. Now go, go, go. But don't you step on my blue suede shoes. Well, you can do anything. But lay off of my blue suede shoes.
