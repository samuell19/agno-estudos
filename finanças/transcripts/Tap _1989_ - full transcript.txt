There's a kid across the hall, man. Hey, what is he talking about? Some kid across the hall. Nobody knows what he's doing. I better check this out. No, no. Not now, not with the hand I got. Hey, Mo. Little Mo. Mo. Mo, there's a kid on the third floor. Hey, Mo. MAN: Who's that guy? MAN 2: I don't know. I don't know. Hey, Little Mo, there's some guy in there playing your music. I can hear him, Bunny. Anybody know who this kid is? Did anybody invite someone? He's good. Would you mind? I can't even see him. Let me get in here. MAN 3: Somebody better find out who he is. MAN 4: Somebody better do something. I'm gonna kick his butt out. Don't worry about it. I'll find out who he is. Yeah, we'll find out. Yeah, we'll find out. Beautiful. [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, young man, you're on the wrong floor. This is third floor. It's private. You wanna dance, you gotta go down to the first and second floor. Hey! You got a hearing problem or somethin'? Mo. Sandman, how's your feet? They all right. Damn, why the hell you gonna ask about my feet? They all right. Max. Ha-ha! I didn't recognize you. And you're wearing your shoes. Yep. Hey, them taps you were laying down was pretty good. Thanks. You looking for a gig? No, no. I just stopped by to see Amy and the boy. Oh, that's nice of you. Hey, I got some new steps. Uh, no, thanks. I mean, it would go with that music you been playin'. Yeah, thanks anyway, Mo. But I'm just exercising. Exercising? Exercising. [WHISPERING] Who was that, Little Mo? That's Sonny's boy. MAN: I told you that guy looked familiar. Let's get back to the game. I got five aces. MAN 2: I thought that boy quit his dancing. MAN 3: He did quit his dancing. Quit it long time ago. Then why is he dancing? MAN 3: Who the hell knows? [CHUCKLES] Oh, man. Just a while ago, up on the roof, I had this great idea, see. I said to myself, "That's a good idea, but the hell with it because ain't nobody around here good enough to pull it off." Then I come downstairs, walk into the room and boom. The one guy who can do it has his tap shoes back on after all these years. Now, you know somebody's trying to tell me something. I don't care what nobody's trying to tell you. You ain't got no business on your feet. Oh, will you stop that? The boy won't even dance with you. That's whhe says. But this is too good to let it go to waste, just because he don't know what he wants to do. Don't you worry, Sandman. He gonna dance with me. Somebody should dance with you. What you looking at, Sandman? What the hell you think I'm looking at? Why don't you look for yourself. [LAUGHS] Hey. What's going on? What do you mean? Well, you're walking back and forth, shaking your head. You're laughing. What's the problem? I don't know. I ain't got no problem. You the one with the sloppy left side. Oh, and there's one more thing. Ah, but there ain't no sense in getting into it. I mean, since you only exercising. No, no. No, please. What? What? Well, Max, you got no form. [LAUGHS] Ahem. I got no form. Listen, listen, Mo. Now, I know you guys were good in your day, but since you ain't got no legs, there's no reason-- Hey, hey, hey. [POUNDS CANE RHYTHMICALLY] What do you mean? You think we ain't got no legs? Is that what you saying? Sandman. Come in here, come in here. You know what this young man said? We ain't got no legs. That means I ain't got no legs, you ain't got no legs. And them men in there ain't got no legs. Now, what does that sound like to you? A challenge. Now, I didn't challenge nobody. Oh, yes, you did. Challenge! Hey, challenge. Challenge? Challenge! Challenge! What challenge? Hot damn, let's get up there and find out-- Bring in the guys. Come on in here. Go ahead. All right, go ahead. SANDMAN: We got a punk saying we ain't got no legs. I didn't challenge anybody. A challenge is going on. Make a circle, make a circle. Come out here and show him, Arthur, how we get time. Bend those legs, Arthur. That's it, baby. Bend them. All right, Arthur. MEN: ...seven, eight. Yeah. [PLAYING JAUNTY TUNE] Yeah, man. Come on, Arthur. Work the rhythm. [MEN CHEERING, WHOOPING] Ha-ha! Go, Bunny. The typewriter. LITTLE MO: Check it out, Bunny. Show this bum your feet. Whoo! All right, all right. Can you slide? Jimmy Slyde. Go, Jimmy. Punk, what do you think of that slide? You ain't never slid that far in your life. Come on. Yeah! Whoo! Hey, look at that. Shhh. What about them legs, boy? I'm watching him. You need to. ALL: Hey! Leave it out. Leave it out. [STOPS PLAYING] He don't need no music, see? Yeah! Get down on there. Get in there. Wait a minute. What's he doing? Wait! ALL: Olé! How 'bout those legs? Looking good. Hey. Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. I wanna take me something. Wait a second. You ain't gonna take nothin' out here. Hold my glasses. You ain't gonna take nothin'. I got to give you this. What are you pushin'? Hit me with something. Go ahead, Sandman. [PLAYING PLAYFUL SONG] Yeah. Louis. SANDMAN: Dig that. Now. MAX: What? Sandman? Yes? ALL: Uh-oh! You want some parts of this? Well, I believe I will. Think I'll take me a little part of this. Give him nothing he can steal. Yeah, Mo, put it on him. Put it on the floor, Mo. Dig it. Watch this. Cut it, Mo. Cut at it. Okay. Make him answer you, Mo. Get him, Mo. He's getting mannish, Mo. You got to clamp down on him. Stay with him, Mo. Stay with him. Stay with him, Mo. [MEN CLAPPING, CHANTING RHYTHMICALLY] Uh-oh. Give me my cane. What do you think you're doing? And what are all you doing standing around here watching? You should be ashamed of yourselves. Now, get out of here. Go on. Get out of here. Get out. [ALL GROANING] Oh, Amy. Gonna stay up with him all night? Drive him to the doctor at 4 a.m.? Get on out of here. You? What about you, Sam? Amy, did you see that Max is back? Hi, Amy. AMY: You know what the doctor told you, Papa. Stay off your feet. Take it easy. LITTLE MO: Hmph. I'll still be dying. I'll just be more bored doing it. That's impeccable logic, Papa. Damn! Louis, follow him and find out where he's staying. You wanna kill yourself, is that it? Come on. We've got to talk. [SOFTLY] Amy, Amy, Amy. I have tried. Darling, I swear to you, I have tried. But I just can't pull it off. I can't make it work. I go in there and play cards with the guys. I've tried gardening upstairs. But I ain't good at none of them damn things. I'm only good at one thing. I'm a tap dancer. And, Amy, I'm proud of that. I got something I gotta do before I go, and Sonny's boy-- Sonny's boy. [SIGHS] Papa, he's not interested in your ideas. You know what he's like. He's got his shoes on again. Now, when's the last time you seen him up here with his shoes on? And he's got his daddy's legs on top of them shoes. I still got a few tricks left, but I need Max to help me pull them off. And I gotta be on my feet for that. So that means... no more gardening. And if I'm gonna die... [♪] I wanna die with my tap shoes on. I want you to apologize to him. Papa... He's staying at the Clark Hotel. LITTLE MO: Thank you, son. Now, here's what I want you to tell him. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] MAX: Yeah? Hey. Just making myself a drink. You want one? What are you doing here? Is that hello? Hello. What are you doing here at the Clark? Well, I just got back into town. I needed a place to stay. [SCOFFS] What is this? What--? Where are the slick suits and the limos? Well, listen. What is this, Dragnet? Huh? You interrogating me? Yeah. Well, I'm here to deliver a message. You know, Pop's got some crazy idea that you've changed. So... tonight's Hoofers' Night. First Tuesday of the month we all get together over at Charlie's club. Papa's leaving Sonny's around 7. Now, Max... I don't know what you're up to, but do me a favor: Don't come. [STAMMERS] So it's Hoofers' Night. Yeah. Tonight. You going? Why? I don't know, thought we might... get together after, talk a little bit. Talk a little bit? These visits of yours aren't appreciated. You pop in, you pop out. What has it been now, two, three years? Do me and Dad and Louis a favor. Get lost. Amy. Now, you don't mean that. I don't, huh? Nah. I can tell. You still feel something. You're right. I still feel something. I still feel the same way it felt when I was 17 years old, and the curtains opened for Max Washington and Amy Simms. And there ain't no Washington! There ain't no Washington 'cause he's off with his buddies somewhere robbing a liquor store or something. Yeah, I still feel the same way, pissed. Amy. Forget about it, Washington. Come on-- Don't even dream about it. I'm supposed to dream about it. I'm right across the street from Sonny's. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [HORNS HONKING] Those pork chops of yours are getting real nasty, Sandman. [LAUGHS] Don't tell it to me. Tell it to the pig. Didn't cook himself up in no rubber. Put that back. Leave it alone. The kid ain't comin'. How you know he ain't comin'? You got a crystal ball in that frying pan of yours? Just...get out of here. Damn! Oh, Amy. Harold says that Max is back in town, and he's got his shoes on again, and he's going good. Yeah, he's going good. I guess he is. LITTLE MO: I tell you one thing, when he performed... he was somethin' to watch. He had his daddy's style and his daddy's grace on that stage. He ain't had his daddy's nothing. Kid's a quitter. Always been a quitter. Quit on his dancing. Quit on his daddy when he was sick. Quit on everything. All I know is, Amy arrived in town with a brand-new baby and a runaway husband. Max raised up Louis as if he were his very own. That's right. And then he quit on him. LITTLE MO: Shut up. He came that close, that close to being a star... before it all went down. That's right. Mm-hmm. When what all went down? The work, son. When the work all dried up. You mean, you guys used to work? What? No, he didn't. Get over here. I know one kid that's gonna get hurt. Come-- Bring him down front here. Let me tell you somethin'. You looking at everybody in this room, son, was a headliner. MAN: That's right. LITTLE MO: Everybody headlined. It was that rock 'n' roll that killed us. Oh, no, no, no. Rock 'n' roll still killing us. You wanna go dance to that junk? Hey, Mo, Max is out there. MAN: I've got to have a beat for my feet. I can't be out there jumpin' up and down on all that loud music going on... [♪] Can I take your plate now? Shut up. I told you about him, baby. Hey, Maxie, welcome home. Come on in. Excuse me, folks.

I want you to hear it. Tell him. Lay it on him. Well, Mo and me been talking about mixing tap and rock. I mean, nobody thinks of doing it. Why? Because you can't hear it, that's why. That's the only reason. But check this out: I rigged up pickups underneath these taps. I run these through my system, and, like, boom! They're gonna hear this in Scarsdale. I can also hook these up to my whole stack of synthesizers. You can change the sound of whatever you're tapping to any sound you want. You follow what I mean? I gotta make this next number. With a house band here, we can work you in any time you want. You sing, right? Of course the man sings. Would I bring somebody ain't got no voice? He got a great voice. Cool. Talk to you later, Mo. Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What is this? Well, we're talking about the future. There are kids that come in here every single night. They pack this little joint. But they don't know nothing about us, what we stand for, tap dancers. What are you talking about? How much money do I get if I go up there, huh? How much do you two split? Couple hundred a week? Come on! It ain't what you make that matters, Max. Listen, Mo-- MAN: Next up on Tap Night, Amy Simms and the Shim Sham Girls. Hey, Jane, let me see you dance.

Yeah, that's all my stuff. All the women? Mm-hm. That's me. Wow, that's good stuff. Now, they're a little old. Is that who you want to show me? Not all of them. Dorothy. She's blond. The blond-- Yeah. She would play. She would play on-stage. And the thing is, you know-- What? Uh... N-nothing. It's '30s, right? So it's a period thing, but some of the stuff-- [LAUGHS] What? What am I doing? Excuse me, Bob. This is my friend Max Washington. Max, this is Bob Wyeth. Pleasure. My pleasure. No, what I'm saying is, it's a period thing, but-- Excuse me, Bob. I hate to interrupt, I really do, but I just had to come back here and tell this woman what a terrific performance that was. Huh? Can this woman dance, Bob? [CHUCKLING] Yes, she can. Yeah. Very attractive too, wouldn't you say? I certainly would. Yeah. Uh, you a hoofer, Bob? No, I'm a-- Bob's a Broadway director. I'm helping him cast his next show. Now-- Oh, tap show? That's right. Oh... So let me get this straight, just for me, Bob. You're a Broadway director directing a tap-dance show, but you don't know how to tap-dance? How do you do that, Bob? Max. No, it's a valid question. I directed a show about suicide last year. I haven't done that either. It's imagination, Mr. Washington. Imagination. Yeah. Well... Touché, Bob, touché. Listen, you mind if I have a minute with Amy over here? Great. Bartender, a drink for my friend Bob here. What do you think you're doing? Let's get out of here. There's a great Italian restaurant-- Wait, wait, wait. Am I missing something here? I thought I made myself clear the last time we talked. I have to be here. This isn't just for fun. I'm working with Bob. Bob will be fine. He can just imagine you're with him. MAN: Let's have a big round of applause for all our lady dancers this evening, come on. [APPLAUSE & CHEERING] Fabulous. Say, Bob. Yeah? This is gonna take a little longer than I thought. It's just family business. Uh, do you wanna catch a cab? No, that's okay. No? No. Good night, Amy. No, wait, Bob-- No, it's all right. I'll see you tomorrow. Nice meeting you. Bob. Great, Max. I've been trying to get him down here for two months to see some real tap, and you go and scare him away, Jesus! Hey, what--? LITTLE MO: Welcome, everybody. I wanna thank you for being here with the tap dancers. [APPLAUSE & CHEERING] A lot of you young people have asked me, "Say, where you guys get your moves from that you do when you're tap-dancing?" Well, I'll tell you where we got our moves. We stole them. MAN: Yeah, that's right. We stole steps to come up with our own style. If you don't like Italian-- Shhh. LITTLE MO: However, there was only one man that no one could figure out who he stole from, see? Because he didn't steal from anybody. He stole his steps from the sounds he heard on the streets of New York City. Come on. Shhh! He was an original. I mean an original, and his name was Sonny Washington. [APPLAUSE & CHEERING] Now, nobody can tell you about how Sonny moved. Nobody can do it, except maybe one man that we're lucky enough to have in the audience tonight. Sonny's son. MAN 2: What? Yeah. Max Washington. [APPLAUSE & CHEERING] LITTLE MO: Come on up here, Max. Take us outside. What did he do? Whoa, whoa. Hold it. Hold it. Thanks anyway, Mo. Thanks anyway. Another time. Oh, what do you mean, "another time"? This is Tuesday. Yeah, I-I wish I could. I-I ain't got my shoes. I didn't bring my shoes. LITTLE MO: Wait. What size do you wear? Eleven. MAN: Uh-huh. Who got an 11 here with some good taps? There you go. There's another pair. Come on, Max. Let's take everybody outside and show them how your father got his steps. Come on, everybody. Do this for my old man, Max. LITTLE MO: Let's go. Move it. Let's go outside. All right, now, if I go up there, it's you and me tomorrow night, 7:00, huh? It's damp out here, it's cold out here... Thanks a lot. All right. So, uh... this is it. This is the spot where my father stole his stuff. Right out here. He'd be out here on the corner, and he'd be trading steps with his friends. When his friends would leave, he'd stay and listen to the sounds of the city. Yeah, yeah. I mean, listen. Listen, listen. [METAL CLANKING] [METAL PLATE CLANKING] There's something. Ah! See, that's what I'm saying. What I hear is, I hear, "Ba-dee ah, ba-dee ah." Eh? Ba-dee ah, ba-dee ah. See? Now, what I'm saying is, ba-dee ah, ba-dee ah. You dig? Ba-dee ah, ba-dee ah. So now I'll try it, and then you try it. And, ba-dee ah, ba-dee ah. CROWD: Ba-dee ah, ba-dee ah. [HORN HONKS] Ooh, incorporate the horn. You hear the horn, Mo? Ee-ee. So, ba-dee ah, ba-dee ah. [HORN HONKS] [TAPPING] [LAUGHTER] [SIREN WAILING] [THUDDING] MAX: Come on. Follow me. Come on this way. I wanna go down here because I think I hear something I might want to use. I think we got it all, yeah. Look, we got the road, we got the time, boom. Yes. Yes. Uh, don't mind us. We're just, uh, tap dancers. [THUDDING CONTINUES] MAX: You feel that?

Alley in the back. Roof access. Shouldn't be much of a problem. What's the take on this thing? Uncut: 750,000. We get 5, the owner gets the rest plus insurance.

Hello. Yeah. I'm sorry. We're closed for the holidays. Yeah. Listen. I practically raised you. I used to change your dirty diapers. Now, I just gave you a new deck of cards and Knick tickets.

[UPTEMPO JAZZ TUNE PLAYING] Oh, look. [JAZZ TUNE ENDS] [CHEERING & APPLAUSE] Ball. Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight. Stay together. Keep it clean. I wanna hear those taps. [PIANO PLAYING ELEGANT MUSIC] So what ever happened to that guy you were so tight with? What was his name? Um... What was his name, Joe? [GIGGLES] Odabiah, was it? Ralph. Ralph. Ralph, that's what it was. Yeah, whatever happened to him? Weren't you gonna marry him? I was thinking about it. Didn't work out. You know, Ralph was a good enough man. Solid, hard-working, responsible. [SNORES] Yeah. Tried to make it work. Gave up some of my classes. I couldn't do it, Max. Dancing is too much of who I am. What about you? What are you gonna do? What do you mean? What? With your dancing. What are you talking about? Papa thinks you're back. He wants to work with you. Oh, right. Well, Papa's wrong. Well, something's going on, Max. Now, what is it? Talk to me. Because I saw you out on the street last night dancing again. Your hoofing's strong and sharp. You've been practicing. Maybe. Whereabouts? [LAUGHS] Whereabouts? Sing Sing. WAITER: Your check, sir. There you are. Chez Sing Sing. Prison. Yeah. What happened? I screwed up. Got a little careless. It's my father's fault, actually. I had to work the night of his funeral, and I got a little drunk, and... So they gave me a couple of years. Jesus, Max. Where does, uh... the dancing fit in? Well, I was doing my time, and I was doing all right. I was just trying to get through it. Had my parole coming up and, uh... But there was this one guard. Browder. Messed with me every chance he got. He hated me because I wouldn't take any of his shit. And then one day, he just went too far, and I lost it. I jumped on him, and I just beat him. I beat him for every time he messed with me. I beat him till they pulled me off of him. Then they beat me up a little bit, and... threw me in this box they call purgatory for about three months. Tacked on a year to my sentence. Oh, boy. So there I am, in this-- In this hole. And I knew I'd blown it. Ahem, so... I'm in there, you know, and-- And my head is spinning. And my heart is pounding. [SIGHS] I can't breathe. So just about the time I felt like I was going over the edge, I started to hear these combinations. These combinations, you know. Shappen-de-bippity-doo, boom boom. Ze-zap-bap, zup-be-bop-bop. Da-wop. And I knew that was coming from deep, from way deep inside me. So I got up, and I started to move with it, started to dance. And I felt better. I could breathe again, you know? [LAUGHS] So when I got out of the hole, I put in for some shoes and got some wood together and, uh... After that, whenever I felt like I was going over the edge, I'd just start to dance. Pulled me back. I guess I got used to it. You know, every now and then, I needed to pound some wood. [LAUGHS] What's so funny? I can't believe this. What? I never thought it would happen. Is there something I should know--? You don't even get it, do you? I bet you don't even know why you asked me out on this date. I was hungry. I wanted to eat. No. No. You wanted to show me that you're back. It took them throwing you in a hole, Max, but you're back. Papa was right. Amy, you got this all wrong. I ain't back to nothing. You lie, you lie, you lie. We in a restaurant. You calling me names in front of the people? You're a liar, and I can prove it. Come on. Where are we going? Just come on. [♪] So this is what you wanted to show me? Yeah, this is the show I'm casting. Yeah, come on over here and take a look out there, Max. [APPLAUSE & CHEERING] Tell me you're not a dancer. Go ahead and tell me you don't feel that. I didn't feel none of that. You are such a liar. Come on, Amy. You tried to show me Broadway tap-dancing. Okay. But five years ago, there was nothing. Look, baby, all I'm showing you is that there's work. Now, Papa's got some ideas. This company we just left is going on the road. Tomorrow, we're putting together a whole new line, baby. What's so funny? I got to laugh. I can just picture me in that line. And then what happens after that, huh? A gig on the road? Maybe I teach a class or two? Uh-uh, Amy. I'm not like my father. I'm not winding up with nothing. Your father was a good man, Max. Oh, yeah, yeah. Good ol' Sonny Washington, huh? Always a big smile waiting for you on the Sonny side of the street. Well, the man could smile. Yeah, yeah. Even when we were flat broke, he was still smiling. My mother, she was smart. First guy came along with some real cash money, she was gone. And that's what's happening. Cash money. And where do you get the cash money, Max? I got my ways. What ways? Don't worry about it. Listen. Somehow you were given a second chance. But you're just too angry and stubborn to see what's right in front of you. Amy, Amy. Did you have a good time tonight, huh? You like dressing up in nice things and going to nice places, places you can't go to when you're stuck on the third floor? I never needed any of those things, Max. You did. All I ever needed was a place to dance, Louis, and somebody to love me. Good night, Max. Amy-- No. Good night. [DOOR SLAMS] Ahhh... Ha-ha. [GRINDING, CLINKING] [♪] MAN: Hey! Hey! A 50-center. Hey, butterfingers. Hey, Washington. [PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE] MAN [OVER SPEAKER]: All right, people, once again, when you're tapped, please step out of the formation right away, and as quickly as possible move out. And you people in the back, step up and fill in the empty spots, okay? Thank you. Don't look at me like that. I'm just trying to get a job. [PEOPLE LAUGHING] MAN: I didn't see that. Taking it back. I gotta see that again. It's out of sight. Great. But I've seen it enough. Can I have that? Stop. Hey, is this the Sullivashow Max did? Arthur. Yeah. What's going on? Max got in that show Amy's working on. MAN 2: That's TV. That's TV. And it's coming from the heart. LITTLE MO: Psst. That's what I like about it. MAN 3: Beautiful. I mean, right through. Oh, shit. [MEN CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY] Amy, can I speak to you in private just a minute? Sure, Pop. Come on. We'll go over here. What's going on? Oh, nothing much. Amy, you wanna tell me what the hell's going on out there? What are you talking about? I'm talking about Max. You're supposed to be working on him for me. Not some dumb-ass Broadway show. It's a job, Pop. "It's a job." I have no objections to a dancer getting a job. But that boy is not just a dancer. He's a hoofer. That's why he's on the third floor, not down there on the first or second, where they go, "five, six, seven, eight. La-dee-da." The boy is special, Amy. He has to have his freedom. He needs to have his space. You can't keep that kind of a talent on a leash. He went to the audition on his own. Well, I'm gonna go and talk to him. No, you're not gonna do a damn thing. Max tried out for a show today. You know how big a step that was for him? He did something positive for a change, and it worked. Look at him, Papa. He's feeling good about it. Don't take that away from him. [SWEEPING CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKER] I can't believe this. That you're gonna teach me how to dance. I'm not trying to teach you how to tap-dance. I'm teaching you the steps to this damn number. Now, get over here. [UPBEAT JAZZ PLAYING] I want you to get the solo spot, Max. So stop complaining and learn it. Remember to use your arms, Max. You got it. Go ahead. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. What are you doing? I'm trying-- You're stomping like you wanna break through the damn roof. Easy, light. That's not my style. Well, that's the way he wants it. Bob. Mr. Imagination. I should show Bob how this stuff is really done. Max, this is a set piece. Five different dancers have done it the same... way for three years. You've got to do it like everyone else. I don't do it like everyone else, remember? [LAUGHS] [ORCHESTRAL VERSION OF "CHEEK TO CHEEK" PLAYING] You put this on? It was a good routine, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. The black Fred and Ginger, huh? Mm. Another one of my father's lame ideas. About 40 years too late. It wasn't lame. It was romantic. You looked so good in your tuxedo. It's true. I did. [BOTH LAUGH] Too bad we never got a chance to perform it after all that work. Yeah. Well... you remember any of it? You remember any of it? [IMITATES LITTLE MO] Sounds like a challenge to me. It is a challenge. Ah-ha! [LAUGHS] [HIGH-PITCHED] Challenge! All right. I certainly hope you do remember, because I do. AMY: I remember. They falling in love again, Mo? Son...that ain't none of our business. Now, come on. Pajamas are waiting for you. Whoa. I'll get the door. MAX: Which side? AMY: This side, 'cause I'm on the left side. MAX: First step. You remember the first step? AMY: The first step. Yes, I remember. Mo! I'll be right there, son. Be right with you. [MAX HUMMING "CHEEK TO CHEEK"] Okay. [BOTH LAUGH] Ha! Hey. Ha! [LAUGHS] Oh, yeah.

I just thought you might be interested in seeing what the real stuff looks like. The real stuff? And what, my friend, do you think we've been doing? Bullshit. This is bullshit here. It's not even tap-dancing, man. They didn't tap-dance like that in the '30s and '40s. Not the good ones, anyway. Well, I guess we're not interested in the good ones. I guess we're interested in... the same kind of dancing that's made this show a hit for the past three years. I know we all appreciate the little history lesson. [LAUGHING] [WHISPERS] David! But for now... you can either do our bullshit, or you can do your trade out in the streets. What'll it be, my friend? Max Washington is my name. The original routine this time, Ray.

Do I look like I'm smiling to you, Mo? Huh? Is that what you thought? You thought your father was a failure? Sure, they took away the money, the fame, the jobs. But there was one thing they couldn't take away, Max. They couldn't take away his legs. They couldn't take away his pride and his dignity. You know the reason why? Because he knew he was good.
