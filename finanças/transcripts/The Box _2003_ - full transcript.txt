What's it look like? This big and it's white. Try not to break it. Don't break it. Thank you. Different paper, isn't it? What's your occupation? You could say, I'm a craftsman. What do you make? What's all this? Basic ore. Essentially, they're rocks. Those stones, turn to iron. I listen to the faint voices of the rocks. Then I carry out their wishes. I use such stones to make many different machines. What kind of machines? As the stones wish. But, it's actually very difficult. Breaking them down is the easy part. But it's very difficult... ...to carry out the wishes of this one. I still haven't managed to fulfil it's wishes. I wonder where it's been today? Look at what you've done. Oh,no. Have you seen the box? No, not today. Are they all artificial flowers? Yes. No plants have grown here for a long time. Now, at last, I know what I can grow here. My plant... ...the one I put by the window... it's already dead. Can I have one of these? One of these? But, they're artificial. Take one. Is your wish still the same? One year later... Part 2 "Planting Trees" - Um... - Ah, come in. How do you feel? You look well today. - I brought your medicine. - Can I ask you a favour? Yes. Will you bring me the box? It needs to be tuned. That was it's original wish. I still haven't managed to fulfil it. Of course. I'll bring it later. But... ...where has it gone? Have you seen a box? You haven't. Written & Directed by: Kanji Nakajima
