You're late. A bear, a bear and a tree. A yellow sponge? A mouse and a star. A naked man with a beard! A green soldier. A boy... He's the chosen one. A yellow sponge? Shut up, Mother! The fourth man is on a white horse, a green light on its head, with a 1 or a 2. That's a taxi. Shh! Sun, a lot of sun. The Great Work! The gold coin. Gold is the key! Gold, gold... Gold... The Great Whore of Babylon, with her seven heads, is here among us. She tries to deceive us with her lies, but she only wants to devour our souls! Do not let yourselves be deceived by that harlot. Her only desire is to establish pagan rule! Gold, gold by weight! They're here. You moved! Mom! "TRANSPORT SECURITY" Morning. How are you, cutie? Those blue eyes... Nati! Shall we go into the back room? Say something. You're a real fox, Nati. - 20 grams, 400 euros. - But it was my mother's! I'm always thinking about you. It's open. They're inside. Everyone on the floor! This is a stickup! The bag, fill it up! Now! - Sergio, put it all in. - The watches too? No, they're worthless. Get the rings. They're real gold. Sergio, the guns! Let's go! You must be a lowlife to mix a kid up in this. One more word and I'll kill you. He's right. The boy should be in school. Shut up, bitch! Get your head down! What's going on? Eh? Eh? Almost done. You brought the boy? Are you crazy? I get Tuesdays and alternate weekends, okay? I'm not missing a day with him, even for a stickup. Anything could happen to him. This isn't how it's done. Go in, get the cash, and that's it. I'm doing this shit for him, so we can be together. Sergio, come here! You know I'm doing this for you, right? Yes, Dad, yes. Who do you want to be with, your mom or me? With you, Dad. See? He wants to be with me. - I heard. - I'd do anything for my son. And if I have to go to jail, I'll go to jail. I'm fucking sick of alimony, judges, and his witch of a mother! He's right. The judges always side with the women. What with alimony, school fees, and insurance, I can't even pay the rent! You should've thought about that. I bet you were fooling around. How could I if I'm living in my car? That's enough! Don't you move! Son of a bitch! Run! Look out! - Let's go! - Son of a bitch! Out of the way! Out of the way, fuck! Out of the way! Go! Run, run! Run, Christ! Out of the way, lady! Run, Christ, for Christ's sake! I don't know where he is. Sleeping, I guess. Take the boy, Christ! What did you tell him? You're so stupid. Sure, yes. Listen, I've got to go. Freeze! Hold it! I can't hear you! - Sonia! Sonia! - Where's she going? I'm driving. - You know her? - She's my girlfriend! She took the car! Open up, motherfucker! The M-3O--- fucking move it! Do I take Méndez Álvaro or the tunnels? - Whatever the fuck you like! - Shut up! Whatever you think is best. - Are you an asshole? - Me? Why'd you tell your girl where the car was? I didn't! She just knows everything! She guesses, like the other day at the disco. I come out and she's at the door, waiting for me. Dad, there's a man in here. Not now, champ. I should go. You guys are busy. Help! Keep still! Christ! Christ! The taxi was occupied. I'm meant to wait for a free cab? If it's okay with you, we'll go via Vicente Calderón. There's less traffic at this hour. Fuck! Motherfuckers! I can't see a thing. The bi- your mother. - Mom? - How are you, honey? - Great! - Have you had your snack? - No, I haven't had it... -Why not? - Or done my homework. - Why's that? I'm in a taxi with Dad. Where are you going? - The police are chasing us. - What? - Give me the phone. - Sergio! We held up a store. - What's that? - Sergio, the phone, please. We've got a bag full of gold! - The phone. - Put your father on! Silvia? Hey, how are you? Playing with some kids in the park. We're about to do his homework and get a snack. Hold on a second. Sorry. What are you doing? I'm getting out. Help! Police! Help! Police! Get me out of here, please! Police! Motherfucker! Doesn't this have a door lock? - Yes, it's childproof. - José, for God's sake! - The phone. - What's going on? Silvia, sorry. - Can you hear me? - Yeah. What are you giving the boy? Sandwiches and hot chocolate. Do I ask you what you feed him? Don't get crabby! I'm not getting crabby! You drive me nuts! - "What I do with the boy?" - What are you on about? I don't have to explain to you! I'm his dad! He's fine with me! Step on it, or I'll blow your head off. I got to go. Bye. Step on it! Step on it! Sergio, are you all right? It's like GTA: San Andreas! Do I take the Burgos, Zaragoza, or Extremadura Freeway? - Do we head south? - South! Why south? A getaway's always south, to Mexico. - That's in the movies. - Portugal? - We're going to France. - Why France? We're going to live in Disneyland, in Paris. I didn't say we'd live there. I said we'd go there, then we'll see, okay? Can you see me in Disneyland? Go where you like. This isn't how it's done. You take the boy to a stickup, now he chooses the hideout? You can't cater to his every whim! He won't love you more for it! Tell him! Tell him! Excuse me, if it's France, can I call my wife to say I won't be home for dinner? Give me the phone. She's gonna be so mad. She's gonna be so mad. Hands in! I told you before! Nothing. He knows I get mad when he doesn't answer. - Maybe he's got no signal. - Signal? What he's got is no shame. You know how late the alimony is? Three months! Not a red cent for his son! He's wearing last year's school uniform! It doesn't fit him anymore! Did you consider joint custody? What? I considered getting him locked up unless he coughs up. I'm giving you a sedative. You look jumpy to me. But I'm fine. Joint custody... I'm suing him in Family Court. The next time he sees the boy will be in jail behind glass. Maybe that'll snap him out of it. Move it! Can't you see it's a serious case? 25,000 gold rings stolen from a store in Madrid's Puerta del Sol. It was all Christ's idea. Who's this "Christ"? - What did he say? - "I don't know." You don't? You're a translator. He said, "I don't know." "None of us knew our real names." Take those masks off, please. Now! Come on! Fuck. "We met in the store. I was broke. I had to sell what little I had left." Judas Thaddeus. Patron Saint of Lost Causes. It looked simple. Lots of gold, low security. We just had to get into the store without being conspicuous. I get it. Let me get this straight. You work as mascots in the square? No. That's a no. That's a no? What the... You wear this thing? They're work clothes. Sergio, what's wrong? What's all this about? We're in this together, right? It's what we wanted. He's ten. He's in shock. He's traumatized. Have you got any kids? Not as far as I know. Then shut your mouth. You've got no idea. This is textbook stuff. It'll scar him for life. You never read a book in your fucking life. Please, watch the gun. It's dangerous in here. Sorry. I don't want to bug you- you're very busy- but I have to get to Badajoz; I really do. They called me about a job- I'm crying because I haven't done my homework. We'll do it when we get there. Mom said homework comes first. Let's get this straight, Sergio. Mom's not in charge here. I am. When you're with your mom, do what you like, but now you do as I say. We'll do your homework, but not now. Later. Okay? Cops! Okay, it's over. Sergio, what is it now? What is it? I left my bag behind, with my homework, on the counter at the gold store. What did he say? Do we turn around? Hold on a second. When we covered the books this year, do you recall what I said? Yes. What did I say? To put my name and address and your phone number on the first page. And did you do that? No. Yes! "GENERAL KNOWLEDGE, FIFTH GRADE" Yes, that's me. Yes, he's my son. No, he's with his dad. What's wrong? Where did you say? No, that's impossible. This must be a mistake. Are you sure they're his? Sure. Of course. I understand. This is no good, lady. What did you do? This is quite ruined. This is when we got married. You can't see his face. I only have this photo because my dad's in it. We need a frontal one for an ID. This is all I've got. It was taken when we opened the video club. Here's when we opened the supply store. Food? No, we refilled used printer cartridges. I told him it was a bad idea, but he never listens. Here's when we opened the Chinese restaurant. The Chinese burnt it down. And this is my father's funeral. Poor man couldn't take any more. We were always asking him for money. We'll have to do an identikit. - Of my father? - No, your husband. He held up a public place with the help of your son. What? With my son? Why'd you tell her? Sorry. Didn't you tell her? No, you don't break it to them like that. We wait for the psychologists, Jaime! Come here! Relax, relax. In here. In here. Relax. Take a seat. Here. Look. He's naked! No, he's made-up Jesus Christ, painted silver, like the street performers in Sol. They thought of everything. Sergio! - Silvia! - Silvia, relax! Please take it easy. I assure you, we're doing all we can to find your son. Silvia! Say something to her. Now you show her the video of her son! I overstepped the mark, but I didn't mean to upset you! We need to stay in touch. If he calls, tell us right away! You're too upset to drive. Let's put a tail on her, round the clock. "A tail on her"? This is up to us. Get the car keys. Do it! Fuck! Sergio, Sergio, honey, answer the phone, please. I don't remember your faces. I swear I don't. And what did you do? Steal? Who doesn't nowadays? Please, leave me on the roadside. I'm going to Badajoz. I won't tell a soul. Dad, I'm hungry. We can't stop until we cross the border. Mom says you should eat five times a day. Mom can say what she likes. Christ, he's right. We won't get to France in one go. We have to stop sometime. That's right! Stop and eat, and we'll talk! Our faces were painted. They won't spot us in Badajoz. This isn't an excursion. The cops are after us. And stop calling me Christ! And call you what? Muhammad? Do I call you Plastic Soldier? Well... His name's José. José Fernández Cuesta. He's divorced. He wants joint custody, but Mom refused because she says he's irresponsible. You know what? Your mom's right. I'm sorry, José, but this isn't how it's done. I'm Tony, man. Fuck you. Who cares? - My name's Manuel. - Nice to meet you, Manuel. Manuel Sánchez Garcia. I have three kids. I live in Aluche. I don't care. Okay? This is Marquitos. He cries when I leave home. This is Alejandro, the eldest, and little Laura. She put a photo of me next to Justin Bieber in her room. Why are you telling me this? She's gorgeous. I don't want to get killed because nobody knows me, like this Badajoz guy. Who said anything about killing anybody? And we have something in common. Women destroyed my life too. My mother, my sister, and my wife were friends. They'd meet in the mall to badmouth me. Just like at school. They tell each other everything. They're like a sect, sharing information... Don't start with the sexist routine, please. And I adore women. - I adore them. - Me too. Take Sonia, who I'm with now. She's wonderful. The one who stole our car? She didn't know! I couldn't tell her it was for a stickup! - It was her car? -Yeah. Her car, her house, her dog. Her boxer's amazing! He's called Chusky. Chusky... What do you do when you're not a stickup man? - Me? - Yeah, you. Public relations at Sperm. Not now. It's closed. Some guy died in the bathroom. What's Sperm? A disco. It's like Pasha, but nastier. That's why I did this stickup. I can't tell Sonia I'm out of work. She's a big-time lawyer, she has tons of work, and when she gets home, she wants... she wants to fuck, not listen to my problems. So you're scared of her. Scared? Well, yeah. I am scared of her. Sergio! Please answer the phone. She's a go-getter, real smart. I didn't finish high school. I'm not good enough for her. I do everything wrong- at work, at home, in bed. She's so hot in bed, I'm terrified. What's the problem? You said she was hot. Yeah, it's too much pressure. She gets home from court and says, "Tony, what's for dinner?" But I can't work out her stove, all those buttons. The hotplate heats up, but the frying pan's cold. Do you understand that? We get into bed, she's at my throat like a wild beast. I can't breathe, okay? I got stuff on my mind. My head starts spinning and- You can't get it up? Sergio! 52% of men can't complete the sexual act after 30. They teach you that at school? No, it was in Mom's Cosmopolitan. Sergio, it's a lie. They fudge the statistics. Besides, I'm 26. It happened to me once. Go ahead, spill it. She was the perfect woman. Breasts, hips... Stunning. She talked like a porn movie, the crazy shit she said... You can't get down to it like that. I was so intimidated that in the end, I could only do it by covering her with blankets. What if she dumps me? What if she finds someone better? - They're a curse. - They're devils! They drive you crazy. They dump you; they don't. They follow you around, or they don't. They get in here, in your occipital or some kind of zone. You kill yourself for one of these, and once you're hooked, you want to cut your finger off. Fuck it! I should've done this long ago. I'm with you guys. If I never robbed a bank before, it's 'cause I never had the balls. - Thanks a lot. - I'll tell you something else. You needn't point the shotgun at me. Tony, José, consider me part of your gang. What? You want a cut now? No, I mean... Why should we trust you? Dad, a cop is behind us! Wait! I'll handle it. Fasten your seatbelts. José! Do it slowly, or it won't do up. Sergio, help him. Time to man up. Hold on. Oh, God! Look out! Cool! Relax! We're okay now. Again! Again! - Are you all right? - Again! Sergio! Again! Barely an hour after a Politburo spokesman announced that the border to Berlin was to be opened, the people, with visas incomplete or not even filled out are... What are you doing, you bum? - Get out of there! - Grape juice! I told you not to touch the stuff in the drawer! Always the same thing! Grape juice! Grape juice... I'll give you grape juice. Give me that bottle! And get away from the bar! The TV's gone off! Then put a tape on. I can't right now. It's dry. What's more, I don't think you're funny at all. This show's just an excuse for me to laugh at you and get away with it. Quit whining. You'll look younger and prettier. I'll use some caoba. Caoba makes you look younger, and blonde is out of fashion. - I don't want caoba. - You're so fussy! Welcome. I don't like caoba. I don't want it. It stings. Get it off me. I don't want it. Got any soup? Yes. Three soups. The restroom, please? Down the end, on the left. Thanks. Good evening. Dad, can I go out and play? No. Thanks. - Sergio! - José, José. What? Isn't that guy dead? They're just drunk, smashed... - Señor Moreno? -Yeah. Surly, as usual. I don't think so. But when was this? He looks so young. One day the TV went off, the one that comes over the air. They're videos. They've got no idea. They don't care what you put on. I know them all by heart. It's party time, a special night. Oh, what joy for girls and boys. Didn't they install satellite? Some fellow came by once talking about whatever. But nobody fools me. They just want to bleed you dry. Once you're in the village, go up the hill, and behind it is the border. What's it called? What? The town. Zugarramurdi. The witch town? What witches? I don't know. They burnt some coven at the stake. I'm not scared of witches. I'm scared of bad motherfuckers, and there are loads of them, everywhere. Nice soup, huh? Yeah, delicious. Gotcha! You go in the mouth and come out the ass! Ass! I said "ass"! It's scary at first, but you get to like it. And when you come out, you're not the same. Why? Baga, biga, higa, laga, boga, sega, zai, zoi, bele, harma, tiro... Pun! I don't agree. Because they landed you a cushy job. What's in this? Sherry, ham? What's this flavor? Soup is soup. What's wrong? Are you okay? The devil has no tail, but his pussy's like a cave. A word of advice, and you'll think I just blurted it out. Don't ever contradict them. Who? Say yes to everything. It's for the best. I warned you. What are you saying? Shut up! You talk too much. Get in back. And don't eat the Maggi cubes! Right, then. See you later. Come here! God damn you to hell! You fucking bastards! What's going on? Good evening. I'd just like to say... Thanks a lot. You bastards! My friends! Can I come with you? Do you want to be my friends? Bye! It's party time, a special night. Oh, what joy for girls and boys. They're obviously in cahoots. He rips off the gold, she acts all squeaky-clean, then they meet up in Paris to live it up. You think? I think she just wants her son back. She's a worried mother. So it seems, but they're never thinking what you think they are. What are they thinking? No idea, but it's something else. They're like spiders spinning a web around you. It's comfortable; you're happy, trusting; you feel fucking great; and suddenly, they stick their poison in you! Problems with Raquel? With Raquel? No. She changed the codes on the cards. Alfonso, are you broke? I could check the bank statements, but I can't go in my own home. Did she change the lock? And threw my clothes in the trash. Didn't you have a girlfriend? Me? I've got an iron in the fire. Then dump her before she dumps you, because if she finds out, she's got you by the balls, she'll yank them out by the roots! I'm not going any further. What's wrong? I'm not going in there. Fuck. Don't let me down now. José, this village is damned. They hold witches' Sabbaths. What's that? It's like a big kegger but medieval. - Shut up. - Listen. This isn't some tall tale from a TV psychic at 5:00 A.M. This is serious. I didn't tell you because I don't get it myself, but in the bathroom, there was a man. So? Hey, if it was a woman- He was down the toilet! Where? Shit, it's hard to explain. Down the drain, eyes, looking at me! All right, Manuel- Manuel, wasn't it? First, relax. We've been under stress, and it's not easy, all right? All right. We're very tired. We'll cross the village now, nice and easy, and in half an hour, we'll be in France. And nothing else is going to happen-nothing. Nothing's going to happen? Don't you get it? Witchcraft began here in a cave! The devil, human sacrifice, the lot! I'm not making it up. It's history! Where'd you read that? Ripley's? No. Worlds Greatest Mysteries. I'd read them for hours at the airport taxi rank. It's an obsession. And our karma's so bad now. What's wrong with the gold? It's not the gold. It's the wedding rings! You said it: inside are thousands of broken promises, forgotten dreams, couples that hate each other, failures, cheating, deception, lies! You're bumming me out. So you're saying this is Mordor and we have the rings? I saw two witches on the highway. Look what you did! You're scaring the boy! - See? - Start her up. Relax. Relax, Sergio, okay? We're off to a pretty town with charming people, very old traditions... - Look out. - And nothing else will happen. Look out. Look out! Did you see that? Did you? Fuck! Sergio, back in the car. - But, Dad- - In the car, I said! What happened, kid? What happened? 20 years driving taxis and not a scrape. This is a scrape, and it's nasty. I should never have left home. Let me out, you bastards! We have to call an ambulance. Yeah, sure, the cops too. Fuck that. Don't touch her! Holy shit, you scared me! Why? It's an accident. We're helping, okay? See if she's alive or dead. If she's alive, I don't know, and if she's dead... I still don't know what to do! This isn't how it's done! I told you! We should go before somebody comes along. The woman from the bar! What's she doing here? She's not breathing. Oh, God! I killed her. I killed her. What the hell is that, José? No, no, don't open it! - Why not? - Can't you see? She's a witch! How did she get here before us? Fuck, that's right! We got here by car! Fuck. José, leave that alone. I want to see what's inside. Put it down! No, I want to see what's inside. Put it down, damn it! Put it down! You're acting like kids. Put it down, damn it! - Put it down. - Son of a- What was in it? It went in my mouth! She's not here! Who? The old lady! She's not here! I'm going to go crazy. Sergio, did you see anything? She flew away. The kid's a riot. Seriously, what did you see? Maybe it was an amulet to protect herself or a potion, poison... We don't know the side effects. Shut your mouth and cut the bullshit. This guy's freaking me out. So where's the old lady? It's like that girl that stands on dangerous corners warning you to be careful because she got killed. But she didn't even speak. 'Cause we ran her over. But she'll appear to other people later. Sure, and say she got run over by a taxi from Madrid. That's right. When we get to France, we'll stop, divide the rings, and split up. I don't want to see you again. This is Zugarramurdi. There, that wasn't so bad. What's that? Holy fucking shit! Go, go, go! - What, and run her over? - Go! Stop the fucking taxi! Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Sorry to bother you so late, but have you seen an old lady, black clothes, long, flowing hair? - No. - No. No. She's my mother. Not enough blood to the brain, you know. We're not from around here. We're going to France. She's usually all right. She still works at her age, but if she forgets her meds... Sorry, lady, we can't help you. Very well. We'll keep looking. And sorry, eh? No bother at all. I know it's a lot to ask, but can you take me home? I'm sure she's there. We're in a big hurry, lady. - You've got no idea. - And the meter's running. Sure. Don't worry. I can go alone. I had a hip operation, but the doctor said that exercise would do me good. And forgive me. Good night. Good night. Aren't you going to say anything? Cat got your tongue? What's your name, handsome? Sergio. I'm Graci. Graciana Barrenetxea, like my mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. That's Basque, right? "Barren-Etxea" means "sweep out the house." I had a girlfriend from Basauri, and some of it stuck. There it is. My husband didn't like coming here. In the end, we separated. He had the marriage annulled and became a priest. Can you believe that? Eva! Nothing. She's not in the bar or anywhere. Maybe she's inside. The door's open. She's lost her keys again. Well, we have to go. We're not in that big a hurry. I mean, an old lady alone- anything could happen to her. A car could run her over- Why a car? It could've been a tractor. We have to go. It's late, and the boy's got to sleep. Sergio! Sergio! I'm Tony, princess. Sergio! Sergio! Sergio! Sorry about the mess. We weren't expecting visitors. It's a disaster area. That's kids for you. My brother and I used to race down these hallways. - To us, it was like a maze. - You've got a brother? Yes, a little brother. Mom has him locked up and in chains. Sounds good to me. It's the only way they do their homework. I do that with Sergio. No TV, no Internet, no cell phone. Francisco, my great-grandfather. He was a shepherd. He built this palace over an old tower. He must've sold a lot of sheep to build this. One day he woke up, and they were all dead. Being superstitious, he sailed away to Cuba. - To buy sugar? - No, slaves. It was legal then. That leads to the cellars. Some tunnels link the caves to the village, even to France. Tobacco, guns, you know. You got to get by somehow. That's Begoña. She went down there. It took her a month to make her way back. - What was she up to? - No idea. Mom loved to scare us by saying she was a witch. That's why she's buried facedown. Facedown? Yes, facedown. Not on her back, like normal, but facedown. That way, if you try to scratch your way out, you go deeper underground. Got it? Yeah, sure, it makes sense. A free drink. - What's this? - Public relations. - Come by any time. - We've been here before. He'll turn up. Kids and old folks are the same. Maybe they're together, playing. Yeah, Sergio's real friendly. You must be a great dad. Great dad? He's divorced. Yes, but Sergio took it well. He rarely sees him. He's with his mom, poor kid. But I want him to focus on the father figure. It's vital for his development. I love kids. I'm like a kid. I love to play. Really? What do you like to play? Doctors. What about you? PSP. FIFA, Monster Hunter, Grand Theft Auto... I like playing kiss the cook. Ooh, I love it. I can whip you up something right now. He couldn't make a meatball. None of his balls are any good. I can show you my room. I've still got my toys. That's a brilliant idea. Shouldn't you find your son first? Oh, fuck. Sure. He seems like a bright boy. Yes, if you met him, you'd love him. He's smart. It's emotional intelligence, the good kind. He's happy, warm, sensitive... Where is the little fuck? I'm so sorry. It's all my fault, distracting you with my problems. It's not your fault, lady. The boy should've been with his mother from the start. What are you doing, Mother? Whatever I like. What's it to you? Oh, I knew it! Get away from there! No! Sergio! No, Mom, that's naughty! Mom, that's naughty. Do you understand? What are they doing here? I'm so sorry. She's losing her mind. She's in treatment, with tons of meds. What's she saying? If she doesn't take her pills, her mind wanders. Her mind wanders? What's this girl on about? Please, Jose, forgive us! The main thing is that nothing's happened to the boy. - Open up. - Give me the boy! Step on it! I'll talk to you later, Mother. Talk to me with respect. I breast-fed you. Don't you realize who they are? The taxi driver, the soldier, the Christ... And the chosen one. You were about to ruin it all! I almost roasted the boy! You and your funny ideas. Just as well the father got him out of the oven in time. I really like him, Mom. So why didn't you do something to make him stay? What did you want me to do? Your thing. What you always do. Not with this one. He's different. My brother-in-law calls me about a job, and this happens! Why? I'm a good guy! I want to go to Badajoz! - One question. - I want to go to Badajoz! Have we got a plan about this guy? I want to go to Badajoz! Thank you, my friends. You're human beings after all. Let's talk this over. Let's talk. Bastards! By the time they find him, we'll be with Mickey Mouse. - Move it. - Dad, my back's itchy. Don't scratch it, Sergio. Your skin will peel off. Look, the border. I'll get aspirin and lotion. The best ones are in France. And some Moët & Chandon! We're not screwing it up now, okay? Did we change the license plate? - Yes. - Yes. Did we hide the guns? - Yes. - Yes. - And the bag? - What bag? - The bag with the rings. - You had it. - Shit. - What? - Stop the car. - Why? - We have to go back. - What? - I left it behind. -The bag? Not the bag, please! I saw Sergio and lost my head. I'm sorry. We have to go back. What if we run into Mr. Badajoz? Sorry I insulted you. - I lost my temper. - Shut up. I lost my temper. Oh, not again. Not again, please! No! Please! Motherfuckers! "NO SERVICE" Fuck! Graci! Eva! - José! - What? What? What? What? This isn't how it's done. It isn't! Tony, isn't it? You keep giving me this "isn't how it's done" shit. So how the hell is it done? I don't know! But not like this, okay? And stop hitting on the girl. You're pathetic. Who, me? What did I do? That lawyer crap... The "great dad"? "I want him to focus!" - You're driving him nuts! - Shh! Check out the door. - What is it? - Nothing. - Have they got the bag? - Yes. No. Hold on. The bag- I can't see it. Let me see. Relax. Out of the way, you dick. It's dangerous. Good God, good God... - What's wrong? - I don't know what to say. I didn't expect this. And I've seen things in Sperm. We should get the bag. That's why we came. Yeah, you go. I'll keep a lookout. Do it. Do it... Out of the way! Man, oh, man! What's she doing with the broom? Not sweeping up, that's for sure. Let's get in there. Let's concentrate. Let's concentrate. We're not here for this. Go, go, go. You'll ruin my upholstery. Will you keep still? I can't take it. Are they going to be long? They'll be back soon. O Lord Jesus Christ... What's that? Who's there? What are you doing there? Weren't you going to France? What do you want? Relax, lady. You're here to rob us. We don't have anything. Fuck it! You two, up against the wall! Against the wall, lady. Why have they got guns? Is it because of my mother? She's harmless! She's just got Alzheimer's! Turn around, move it! It's stuck. Relax! Relax, lady. Let's get the fuck out of here. Hold on, Sergio! Run, Sergio! If you're gonna kill me, do it! I can't take any more! Excuse me, miss, what's going on? "SLOW DOWN, DAD" Back, spawn of Lucifer! What are you doing? No idea. Lady! Good evening. Good evening. A small sherry? No, thanks. What's this? I leave you for one minute, and you're at it. Can't you see she's a lady? Get in the kitchen! There's no coverage. No coverage, no signal, nothing. I'm sure lots of people pass through, but you don't remember a man around 30, trashy-looking, not too handsome, with a boy? I haven't seen anything. The boy is my son. Light hair, looks a lot like me. No. He doesn't look like me? I haven't seen anything. As for a trashy-looking man, not very handsome... Does that ring a bell? Is he your husband? Yes. How did you know? I'm a witch. So have you seen him? No. The restroom, please? Down the end, on the right. Lady! - Yes? - Got a smoke? What? - I'll tell you for a smoke. - What? And a little poke! Go away! Leave me alone! Your son's a sweetie. Did you see him? Where did they go? The cigarette. "SMOKING KILLS" Are you going to tell me now? Hello? Attention, Inspector Calvo here, with Jaime Pacheco, on surveillance. Requesting all-units backup on the border. At least two patrol cars. I repeat: Inspector Alfonso Calvo and Jaime Pacheco. We need two patrol cars. Call a sp-spade a spade-no. What are you doing? Come on, grab a crate! You lazy bum! How do I put up with him? Come on, let's go! - It's not working. - Then use your cell phone. I tried. There's no signal. And by radio is the official way. The official way would be to say Inspector Pacheco. That's what I said. No, you said, "Inspector Calvo and Jaime Pacheco." I'm an inspector too. No, I said two inspectors. Inspector Calvo and Inspector Pacheco. You did not. You said, "Inspector Calvo"- That's enough! Anyway, I bet they didn't hear us. Sure, but it's the little things. It's like I'm just a sidekick. No, Jaime, you're my partner. I'm the same rank as you! But you just bark orders at me. "Start it up, faster, slower." I'm the one who drives while you sleep, gets the gas, buys the donuts, puts on the CDs. What do you want me to say, Jaime? Anything, a word of thanks, a gesture, something nice. What do you mean by "nice"? No, don't call her. She's a blabbermouth. I know, dear. It was luck, fate. We'd lost everything, then suddenly they're back. Yes. His father and a couple of friends. Just imagine! Yes. Yes, yes. The more the merrier. José! You're right. We've got enough spicy dishes. Yes, the Urdangoitis. Get them to bring some bread. And bring some ice. José. José, listen. Shut up. I leave him with you for one second, and you lose him! At least he's not here, right? He got away. This can't be happening. What if we're dreaming? We can't all be dreaming at the same time. We're not dreaming. We've been drugged. Remember the old lady's little bag? Jimsonweed, henbane, fly agaric: natural psychotropics. You sure learned heaps at that airport. Badajoz, Badajoz... So you're saying this isn't real. No. It's all in your head. Drugged or dreaming, she obviously likes him more. Relax, Tony, it's pure suggestion. For dinner or the party? For dinner, no more than 30. For the party, just imagine: thousands. No, the boy's not here, but they're out after him. Yes, I don't think they'll be long. "NO SERVICE" Mom! Mom! Hey! Hey! What was that? What? A skinny wild boar with no hair. Must be a piglet. That's weird. Should I stop? No. Why? Keep going or we'll lose her. See? Orders again! You want to drive? Go ahead! Hands on the wheel, Jaime! Here! There are some witches in a house. My dad's with them. They put me in an oven. They threw a man around like he was a ball. Get in the car. No. No! Where are you going, little bird? Let me go! What's going on? My whole body hurts. I think I broke something. Where are we? Open up. That's it. Just a second. Right. Won't be long. Fucking hell. I've only got priest's testicles and innocent's tears to go. For the record, I'm no innocent. I'm a thief. Practically a murderer. Oh, yeah? You know who's a really good guy? He is. He acts like a bad boy, but he's got a heart as big as all outdoors. That's a lie! I drink like a fish. I've got no points on my license. Really, Eva, I'm bad. Innocent's tears are hard to come by, but the testicle thing... He's not a priest, but he looks like one. I'm not even confirmed. I don't like you two arguing. We're not arguing. He started it. Will you shut up? Go on, make up. Yes, there'll be food for everyone. Of course, as usual. Hold on. Eva, I told you not to play with your food! And that tooth's no good. It has to be from a hanged man. No, it's my daughter acting the goat, as usual. Fine, I'll tell her. You must understand, she's at that age... Hey, that's enough, eh? You and I will talk later. What are you doing? Hello, dear! How are you? - A little wine. - Thank you. - Come right in. - See you later. How are you, dear? Look what I brought. That's lovely. Come in. Hello! - Perhaps we're too early. - Not at all. - What did you bring? - Just some cheese balls. They'll come in handy. Don't you recognize her? Eva! My, You've grown! Your mother said you're doing so well! You're studying abroad? Yes, in Germany. With the priests? Tübingen University. Theology. Have you banged them all? Well, you do your best. You bet! Fuck like a bitch, lie through your teeth, and cheat on men. - You're at that age! - Sure. I love what you've done with the place. Do you like it? Come in, Mom's inside. Hello! Oh, how thoughtful! Stop, stop. - What is it? - She's pulled over. Shit, you're too close. Shit! So I do nothing, then. - Stay here. - Fine. - We're fine here. - Whatever you say. Sergio! I want to go home! Start her up. She's moving. - What are you doing? - What do you think? Shit. Jaime! What are you doing? You take the wheel. I'm not your chauffeur, Miss Daisy. This isn't the time or the place. Get in and start her up, for Christ's sake! For the record, I'm doing it because I want to, not because you're ordering me. You're making this a hell of a trip for me. I know you've been following me since Madrid. No, we're pursuing an investigation in the same direction. I don't care! Are you armed? Lady, you don't ask the questions. Can't you see? My son's not with my ex-husband! Those people are abducting him! Hurry! Hurry! Come on! Hey! Hey! Police! - Hey! - Police! Alfonso! Damn it! Silvia! Silvia! Excuse me, but that really hurts. Will you shut up? I want to cry. Then cry quietly. Okay. - Silvia! - Silvia! You should wait here. It might be dangerous! I think we should all wait here, secure the perimeter, and get help. I don't think we're dealing with this matter properly. Fuck! Coming, Alfonso! Let's go. Stay behind us. Eva, what did you make? Fingers! Easy on the fried food. They'll be too full for the main course. You always find fault. This girl... They're eating the Badajoz guy. That almost seems fine to me. The lady on the ceiling freaks me out more. Remember, we're drugged. Yeah, right, my head isn't pounding, and they're not eating that guy. I'm at home with my feet up. Drugged or not, the daughter fancies José. Are you two crazy? They want to kill us, and you're thinking about sex? Go with the flow. Smile. Manuel's right. You've been real cold. She came on to you, and you ignored her. She just strangled that guy! This isn't how it's done. There's a protocol. Secure the perimeter, then set up the operation, not all crazy like this. - Look out! - What is it? I thought I saw somebody. You scared me. I'll go first. Please, miss, what are you going to do to me? Sergio, are you okay? They've got frozen food, but it's arms and legs, Dad! Let him go! The things this boy says! I blame the TV! We eat people up here, but with love and kisses! We're a bit frosty at first, but get to know us and we'll give you everything. We like to eat well, but not little boys like you. Take him to the kitchen! Quiet! Quiet, please. Settle down. Be careful! Girls, quiet, please! The sauce is creamy! Silence! As we do every year, we're here together to celebrate the end of this absurd, hectic civilization that overwhelms us with its vulgarity. We give thanks to the Great Mother for these gifts, awarded to us in Her infinite wickedness. Nobody's come by here for a while. Shh! Shut up! - Why are we going up, Silvia? - Careful! Envy eats away at us. We lie, deceive, and insult our fellow man. Vice and lust are our daily bread. But all this, my daughters, is not enough. The false prophet still rules on the surface, and She, despite our efforts, stays hidden underground. For centuries, we've waited for our Messiah to die and live again in the womb of the goddess, leading us to the final victory. It's not the first time we've tried. We had 30 boys before, Graciana. Not 1 or 2. 30! Chubby, gorgeous... I don't get what went wrong. Maybe, Mother, it wasn't a question of quantity but quality. This isn't like buying bingo cards. Your mother did her best. You can't do any more. 20/20 hindsight is very easy. That's all in the past. We needed a miracle. I can hear voices down below. Here, here! Everything's perfect. The stars are with us. Shut up! The pain and misery hidden in these rings will give us the power to make this year's invocation a success, and from the depths shall come She who reigned at the very beginning! - What did she say? - Something about a ritual? What about a ritual? - Some ritual. - Shh! The gun! The gun! - Lady, give me the bag! -You wretch! Will you leave me alone? Kill them! José, I saw you! I'm not forgetting this! You hear me? Bitch! - What's your wife doing here? - She must've met your lawyer! No way she sold us out to the cops! I wouldn't worry about the cops! We have to give her the rings! You're crazy! What about the Apocalypse? We'll work that out later! Get ready to run! One, two... - Where to? - Just go! So how's Asun? She's got a plum job in the Navarran government. Really? I'm so glad. Such a clever girl. Yes, and her mother's illness was awful for her, remember? Poor girl. How do you feel, honey? Did she eat anything? It goes down badly on an empty stomach. I think I have some Alka-Seltzer. No, something hot. Lime flower or pennyroyal tea. Here you go. Open up. She's got no appetite. It's only natural. With the stress of the trip, head full of worries, men, the family... But that's all over, dear. Don't worry. We'll treat you like a queen here. - Sure, you're among friends. - You'll see. Go down this corridor. At the stairs on the left- Listen to me! Keep turning left! At the cellar, there's a door on the right, okay? - Wait for me by the river. - Okay. Hey! What about the others? What about them? They're coming with us, right? Aren't I enough for you? But leaving them like that... You'd rather be with your friends than with me? No, no, I just mean I want it all to go right, for all of us to be fine... Hold on. Tell me you're not saying what I think you are. No. Well... I don't know what I'm supposed to say, but I'll say anything! You're just humoring me. No, no! I'd never do that! Do you love me? What? I betrayed my family for you! I'm giving you everything! I like you. I really do. Sure. If you like, I'll forget my friends. But leaving my son behind, that's real cold. You want an excuse to break up with me. Break up? No way! I'm crazy about you! But I'm not the main thing in your life. Look, now I think about it, you are the main thing, but one thing doesn't cancel out the other, does it? We can work this out! - Where's José? - I don't know. - What do we do? - Run! Run, for Christ's sake! - Manuel, the bag! - I can't take it anymore, Tony! What are you doing? It has to be here! The Patron Saint of Lost Causes! - Who? - Here it is! Judas Thaddeus. Keep running! This way, Tony! It's me or nothing. You, my love. Always you. You're lying. You're just scared. That... I won't deny. Look, maybe this isn't the best time to say this, but I love you. You don't love me. You think I'm a monster. A monster? You're my baby! Don't you contradict me! I don't know what to say! There's no way to get it right! I hate you! Aren't you blowing this out of proportion? That was wild. And I never believed in saints. You did great, Tony, really. - I showed some balls, huh? - A good pair, yeah! What a rush! That's how it's done! I could take on the world right now! Fucking hell... I feel alive! I feel-l don't know- like a man! When I tell Sonia about this, she's gonna freak out. Will you to tell her you're unemployed too? Yeah, if it comes up in conversation, but I'm taking the bull by the horns. I'll open my own disco, I'll get my car, my house and my dog, and I'll never call it Chusky. I'm on fire! Hello? Hello! Hey! Help! Fuck! I've read all the novels of Zane Grey. What? And I built Burgos Cathedral out of frog bones, 16,000 of them. Been here a long time, huh? 15 years. Right. And you're always here? Yes, here I am, and I like it. When you get used to it, it's quite comfy. That, and the door's locked. Let's go this way, okay? Hold it. - Do you feel the breeze? - Right! We must be near the way out! Light up that way. Did you see that? No, I don't know what I saw. What if we go back? Light it up again. Please! Don't hurt us! Please! Only my sister looks after me. She brings me books. But it's hard now. They're out of print. Your sister's charming. She's got a temper, but she's charming. My name's Luis Miguel. I'm José. José Fernández. My skin comes off. It's the damp. Right. No, that's fine. No. Take it easy. There, there. We've been evil all our lives. Disgraceful! You haven't heard the last of this. We'll talk after the ritual. Mom, please. Do you realize how much you upset your grandmother? Just as well she's half-mad and forgets everything. We've never seen anything like it in this house. Ever! A girl your age should be taking drugs. Stop wasting your time on this tomfoolery. At your age, I was shitfaced all day. As it should be. Men are only good for money. Why don't you have filthy sex, like your friends? Sadism, incest... Coprophagy! Fetishism, zoophilia... Golden showers, fist-fucking, bondage... Bondage? What's bondage? Conchi, you're so dull. With the sacrifices we've made to send you to the worst schools, now you tell me you like him because he's a good person. Oh, please! He looks at me with those eyes... Eyes? Pluck them out! You should use him like a sex toy. What'll you play with him? Scattergories? When he comes, he cries. No! Really? He looked like a strapping lad. Not at all. I read a while ago in Cosmopolitan that men are getting floppier and floppier. I know. You're right. I don't know what's wrong with me! Sorry, Mother. Every time I think about him, I get butterflies in my stomach. - What did she say? - Butterflies. Oh, please! I think I'm in love. You're in what? My grandma's yelling. Can you hear her? No. I can hear everything in this house. Can you hear my son? He's crying, but that's only natural. They've brought him here for the sacrifice. Sacrifice? Where's the cave? Where? If you don't want be seen, there's a tunnel under the cemetery. Chapter ten. Period. "'The sheriff's foolish stance has ruined everything,' said the inspector." Bingo. Help! They say that God created Man in his own image. Who the devil do they think they are? God created Woman in her own image! Do any of you swallow that stupid story of Adam's rib? No! Where is paradise? In hell! Who is God? Our Mother! And what are we? Witches! Men are afraid of us because we know the truth! God is a woman, and they can't bear it! No more good and bad, heaven and hell, virtue and sin! There is only one truth in the whole universe: a grand, omnipotent goddess, cruel mother, merciless daughter, and pure spirit! They tore out our instincts, soiled our souls with guilt, and spat on our sex. The time has come for vengeance. She will return, and justice will be done! Justice! Justice! Justice! What are you doing, you idiot? I don't know. I got carried away. She's going to eat him. That's the idea. She? Who? If the boy survives, he'll be a new man, like me. How can he survive if she's going to eat him? Look at me. I did it. I'd rather not think about that. - You hear that? - What? Rapid breathing, nails scraping on wood, not much air... Don't jerk me around, okay? Fuck. Help meg Hurry! Fuck! Mom did this, didn't she? Obviously. Luismi... What are you doing here? If Mom finds out you left your room- You were grounded! I did a bad thing. Unchain me. No way. You look a lot like your mother. José, don't say that. I thought we had something. Why'd your mother chain you up? I can't tell you. She's in love with you! Luismi! She told Mom. That's why they buried her. Luismi, I'll get you back. When I get out of these chains, I'll kill you both! What about you? Nothing to say? Say something! I'm sorry, Eva. I just got out of a relationship. - I'm sorry. - How dare you! I can't get involved with girls that drive me insane. I always get the nutcases! I want things to be normal, to go to the movies, dinner... But I'm a really normal person. Luismi, let's go. No, no! Where are you going? To stop your mother from destroying Western civilization. Is that okay with you? José, don't go like this! Luismi, honey, tell him to come back! Fuck her. - Luismi! - Go on. Who loves you more than I do? Luismi! I'll put you back in your room! Luismi! - What's that smell? - I think it's sulfur. No, it's the hair on my legs! It's singeing! How long does it take someone to burn? I don't know. It's my first time. But I figure an hour! An hour? That long? Luckily, we'll choke on the smoke first. Just as well. We've got 20 minutes, tops. Alfonso! - Alfonso! - What? Before I die, I want to say that it's been an honor working with you all these years. Me too, Jaime. Sure, but there's more. - Go ahead. - I'm embarrassed. Jaime, we've known each other all our lives! Yes, but here, in front of everyone? We don't care either way. Don't you realize? Realize what? Not even the other day when I fell on you at the karaoke? Spit it out. You've got us on tenterhooks. - I really like you. - What? As a man, I mean. Shouldn't we be on fire by now? Look, Jaime, I think very highly of you, but this isn't the time or place to talk about this. I'm dying of embarrassment! Sure, I understand. Cheer up. It's not the end of the world. It might be. Is it so hard to say something nice in the 20 minutes we have left? Don't hassle me! I'm out of my comfort zone! I need to think! Baga, biga, higa. Laga, boga, sega. Zai, zoi, bele. Harma, tiro, pun. Baga, biga, higa. Laga, boga, sega. Zai, zoi, bele. Harma, tiro, pun. Xirristi-mirristi. Gerrena plat. Olio zopa. Kikili salda. Urrup edan edo klik! Ikimilikiliklik! I didn't do anything! Shit! I didn't do anything! Shit! Fuck! Fuck. Shit... Sergio! Sergio! Let me go! Dad! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! What are you waiting for? See? He's alive! This is the chosen one, fruit of the womb of the Great Mother! The androgynous one! The man who will betray Man! The avenger! Our Trojan horse! Dad! Dad, I'm all right! I'm all right! Luismi! No! Did you see that? Fuck! She swallowed him! We're all getting out of here. Have you got a plan? José, I need you to trust me. You know her weak spot. Yes. But I need your help. What do I have to do? Just distract her. "Distract her"? José! Don't let her swallow you in one gulp! Stall her! Make her turn around! I'll do my best! Get her head down! That way! To the right! - Anything else? - Not like that! That's it, to the right! What are you doing? This way, her head down! Do you trust me? To the death! I love you! Me too! Eva! Eva! My beloved! Eva! Do you really think Eva will look after your son? What did she promise you? That she'd change? I don't want her to change. I like her the way she is: feisty! Get away! Stay back! When you least expect it, she'll rip your heart out. We'll see about that. Mind if I take the boy? He was reborn inside Her. He's ours now. Sergio. Sergio, tell her. Who do you want to be with, your dad or these ladies? These ladies. Get home right now! I need help! Help! Manuel! Manuel! Help me! Please! Don't you dare touch them! Dad! Manuel, grab the rings! For God's sake! Fucking help me! - The rings! - Now's not the time, Tony! Let me go! Mom? Just who I wanted to talk to. Same here. Let go of me! I'm going to sue you for what you've done. You're right. I'm a bad father. You're toast! Okay, okay, okay. I got my son involved in a stickup. A monster ate him up. Maybe it wasn't good for the boy. But what can I say? I needed to see him. Help me, Manuel! - Your hands are burning! - Of course they are! We have to come to an understanding. He needs us both. Let me go! Your kingdom isn't this world anymore, Mother! The war is over! What are you playing at? Give it to me! You're not capable of dealing with the needs of our son! Go, go! Run! Dad, let's go! Run! Alfonso! What I told you before... What? Take no notice of me! Relax, Jaime, I thought it was nice. Really? Run! "ONE MONTH LATER" It's starting. We shouldn't let him do this. He's not hurting anyone. And you know what the psychologist said. Smothering can be counterproductive. Whatever you say. Tell her to file a suit. I'll file a countersuit. Excuse me, we're outside office hours, okay? This woman is tired and needs some time off. Bravo! This kid's going to be big one day, I'm telling you, Manuel. A banker, right? Yes, he's got the look. Hey, babe, shall we go see Lion King tonight? Fine by me. I love musicals. No, we should go to Disneyland. I've never been. Yes, but let's charter a flight. That's right. I forgot! We're millionaires! We're millionaires! I can't stand happy endings. Well, I get all weepy. Silly girl. Look at them, the happy family. They've got money, a car, a house, a dog, a garden... All that will destroy them little by little. And when they're suffocating with happiness, they'll come back to us. "WITCHING AND BITCHING"
