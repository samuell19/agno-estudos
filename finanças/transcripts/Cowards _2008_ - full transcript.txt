COWARDS NICE SHIRT NICE PHONE, CARROT Good morning. CARROT What is this? I really don't get you kids. Okay, Let's pick up where we left off the last time. See if we remember. Gaby. Gaby, you'd better shape up. -Quadratic equations. -Good, Guille. Quadratic equations. All right, the other day we saw what happens when zero is infinite, today that if the discriminant is zero, the equation has only one solution. Let's go, we're on in five seconds. Burglaries are on the rise. Police sources say possibly the work of Eastern European mafias. Continuing verbal abuse in the crisis with Iran. Councilman Nieto received his Marseille counterpart yesterday to exchange ideas concerning public security. In sports, Union Football Club's loss means they could fall to Division II. That's all. Good evening and see you next time on the Evening News at 9 pm. Gaby. Where's your cell phone? I was trying to call you. I lost it. Again? Okay, we'll talk later. Pick up your sister and meet me at the pizzeria. And don't you dare tell your dad you lost your cell. No. I won't. -See you later. -Bye. Why do we always have dinner here? Because we're the lamest family of all time. My friends have dinner at home. Your friends are stupid. -No. -Yes. Has your teddy bear Bernie turned up? Don't worry, the kidnappers will contact you soon to negotiate the ransom. Hi, kids. What's up? What's the matter with my little princess? Nothing. I understand.. You can be sad and not say why. Nobody likes a snitch, right? But Silverio doesn't like seeing sad little girls either. Look, this is for you. -What do you say? -Thank you. Good. What about me? Hi. -What happened to you? -Nothing. -I didn't do anything. -No? Call your mom, see where she is. I left my cell charging at home. You lost it again? You and I will talk. A beer, please. I had a shitty day. And your son lost his cell again. -Again? -Yes, again. Don't play dumb. I could have punched him in the face. Joaqu?n! Come on, let's go. Good night, sweetheart. Good night, darling. Look under your pillow. Don't tell Dad, okay? Our only remaining equation is 3x = 9, which means, clearing the x... To clear the x we divide the two figures by three, which gives us x by x divided by 3 equals 9 thirds, we cross out the three, which means x equals three. Thanks, everybody. See you tomorrow. Sorry, Carrot. It was an accident. -Right in the face! -Come on! We don 't understand. what's wrong with your son. In the last weeks his performance has dropped sharply. We've also noticed he's having trouble concentrating. Even in subjects he used to excel in. Yes, we've noticed his recent odd behavior as well. Well, odd, odd... It's normal at his age. Sometimes students are affected by the end of the semester. Anyway, we'll see if things straighten out. -He's just distracted, that's all. -Don't say that. Gaby's reached a difficult age and he's always had trouble assimilating change. Assimilating change? Fancy reporter talk! You're such a dummy. Well, he has me worried. Relax. I'll talk to him. -That would be nice. -Shit, Merche. You know what I'm going through. -You should fucking quit. -What do we do? Live on one salary? -I have to go, I'm late. -Forget something? What? To bring me flowers sometime, or give me a kiss. Bye. We talked to your teacher today. It seems... you're getting very good grades. And you're also the leader of your class. Guillermo... Honey, it's true. These things usually stand out, don't they? I don't know. Come on, don't be modest. I'm proud. You have your dad's blood. And your mother's intelligence, of course. We also heard you use your cell in class. Come on, honey. That stuff is trivial. The kid's doing great in school. It's disrespectful. -You'll be late to school. -I wish. -What? -Nothing. Gaby, you have to make an effort. I do what I can. Yeah, but sometimes that's not enough. I don't like going to school. I do plenty of things I don't like. Look. I know it's hard sometimes. Promise me you'll make an effort. I promise. -Not like that, mean it. -I promise. And tie your shoelaces, you'll kill yourself. SNITCH -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? -Fine. -You sure? -Yeah. -You didn't look fine yesterday. -I don't want to talk about it. Don't let them treat you like that. I said to drop it. You won't solve anything like this, Gaby. Any better ideas? You wanna talk to them? -No. -There you go. Why don't you tell your folks? Yeah, right. Guille's a jerk. He'll make your life hell until you graduate. -Thanks for the tip. -Okay. Change the subject. Wanna see a movie sometime? Okay. Check it out. Five mega pixels and a super-powerful zoom. -My mom got it for me. -Give it here. Be careful with it. -Does it have Bluetooth or what? -Sure, dumbshit. -Mine doesn't. -Your cell is a piece of shit. Watch it. It was my old man's. Your old man? He's a cheapskate. We'll make a video later and try it out. Okay. Somebody help me! Come on, everybody outside. I can't breathe! Get me out of here! What are you doing? Hey, hey! What are you doing? Hey, what the hell is the matter with you? He's crazy! What did I do, jerk-off? Come on. Yes? Yes, speaking. Right. No, of course. Sure, I understand. All right. Thank you. Goodbye. What's up? My son got into a fight at school. That's just hormones oppressing the brain. So what have we got? -They behave like animals. -This didn't happen in my day. Back then schools weren't parking lots. That's right. Discipline, like I said. Today a wastebasket, next time they'll burn the school down. I took exams to teach History, not to be a cop. Somebody should discipline the parents. You said it. Ever seen a patient's organization in the E.R. telling the surgeon what to do? You haven't, have you? Well, certain parents decide how we discipline at school. -And nobody consults us. -I know. You know what? There's four weeks left in the semester. I've bought 24 cows. I'll go into the cheese business. As long as we're dealing with animals, we might as well make a profit. No. Damn it, Manolo. I'll repaint it. Fucking punks! Are you going to explain to me what happened or not? -Guillermo. -I'm only trying to find out. Let's not give it too much importance. It's kids' stuff. Exactly. He has to face it now or he'll get beat up his whole life and he won't know where it's coming from or why. I'm not hungry. Can I go to my room? No, you can't go to your room. You're not finished eating and I'm not finished talking to you. You have to learn to defend yourself. Nobody can push you around like that. You're my son. I don't have a bodyguard like you. Who the fuck do you think you are? Do you know what you're saying? You have no fucking clue what it's like living in fear of getting shot. Guillermo, please. He's just a kid. He's a kid, but he knows how to hurt. Go to your room and stay there. And leave your cell phone here. Gaby. Your school called your mom earlier. They said you hit a classmate. What happened? You don't want to talk? Fine. Gaby, I've just about had enough. Let's go. -You're not off the hook yet. -Come on, she's falling asleep. Wait, I haven't finished. Maybe this isn't the time. Which is it going to be? Not talking to him is bad, and so is talking to him. Come on. Brazil versus Italy? Full match or sudden death? Sudden death. Hurry up or you'll be late. Hit him in the face! Pow! Hold him down! -Hit him again! -Again! ERASING MESSAGE -What about that video? -What video? -The one we made yesterday. -I didn't get anything. -Me neither. -I didn't send it to you, chump. You better not have sent it to someone else by mistake. No way! Look, I sent it at 8:20 this morning. -Resend it. -Okay, but one more time. -You're a cheapskate. -Send it to me too. -You have to pay one euro. -Why? -For being a chump. -Okay. I'd like to inform you of some new services we'll be offering next year. The first... Miguel, yeah, hold on a minute. Excuse me. What is it? Shall we? One of those services will be a nurse from the local hospital... Excuse me, what? I can't hear very well. A nurse from the local hospital will come once a week to allow students to make certain consultations, which will take place during school hours as well. What sort of consultations do you mean? Well, the sort of consultations both you as parents and we as teachers never dare discuss because they're too embarrassing. Some folks don't talk to their kids, but my daughter tells me about everything. -Like her first kiss the other day. -She didn't tell you the whole story. My son said they did more than kiss. In any case, not all kids are so open, that we know. Are we supposed to pay for this? No, it's completely free. The service is provided by the local hospital. Yes? I know it's unrelated, but my son Leo has a field trip and he's allergic to amoxicillin. Should I send a note? A note? Yeah, great. -Walk you home, Carrot? -You might get lost... You like superheroes? Do you turn into Super Carrot at night? Super Carrot? Super Dickhead. Mommy put a cookie in your lunch? -Smile, Carrot, you're on TV. -Like your momma! Bet the bitch don't wear panties! Hey! What the fuck? Gaby. What's going on? Who understands this stuff? It's for lunatics. -What will you do about your friends? -They're not my friends. I know, it's a figure of speech. Are you scared of them? No. Gabriel, denying your fear won't make it go away. What's your plan? You do have one, don't you? No. Too many of them. Sure, right. Too many of them. You'd have to be Spiderman to take them all on. People expect you to be the strongest. But what you really need to be is the smartest. This is what they never expect. No wonder, because intelligence is a rare thing. Yeah. Though... you can always take them on one by one. Gabriel, do you read the Bible? Because the Bible says: "An eye for an eye." And the Bible is the word of God. It's important. It also says to turn the other cheek. You and me don't read the same Bible. Guille. You may not know this, but hitting people is illegal. What? And recording it on a cell phone is just plain stupid. Mom, I didn't do anything. -Guys from class sent it. -I don't get it. That's your idea of fun? It wasn't me, I told you. From now on I'm checking your cell every day. Believe me, I'd better not find anything similar. Will you tell Dad? Is that all you care about? My God, I can't get the image out of my head. Who's the boy they were hitting? I didn't do anything. -Besides, I'm not the only one... -The only what? Guille, if your father finds out... Did you forget who he is? That's all you care about. Dad's job. No. What I care about is not knowing my own son. Give it a rest, Mom! -Hi, Gaby. What are you doing? -Nothing. -Why didn't you wait at school? -I forgot about the meeting. Turn off that horrible game. -I'll prepare her bath. -Hello? -Who is it? -Nobody. -Who is it? -A friend. Can I go out? -Fine, but don't stay out late. -Okay. I'll be there in 5 minutes. -I don't want a bath without Bernie. -Bernie is lost, sweetie. Yeah. Okay. See you there. -Did you like that? -Yeah. And the song? That too. If you want an encore, you call me. Done. See you tomorrow. I don't know. What kind of salesman are you? Shit, Silverio. Installing an alarm would be reasonable. But installing closed circuit TV is an exaggeration. What good is an alarm? No, no. What I want is to see the jerk who leaves without paying or takes the silverware. Go right ahead. But that won't stop them from doing it. I know. But I'll see who did it and report it. Okay, you're the boss. The customer is always right. You said it! And there are cameras everywhere. We're watching each other. Why? Because we're scared. Of what? Who knows. -Paco... -Human beings are that stupid. Okay, I'm on my way. No, I'm with a customer. Joaqu?n... Do you read the Bible? Good morning. Okay, Last week we went over what happened in 1492. What is it, Guille? I left my cell on the table and it's gone. I thought you'd bring up expelling the Moors from Spain. -I can call and see if it rings. -Fine. Get it over with already. It was in your bag. -That's not my bag. -What? Whose bag is that? Once again, in case anyone missed it. Whose bag is that? Yes? She can't talk right now. I can tell her you called. Okay. No, yes, yes. Yes, it's important. All right. Goodbye. ...to causes like warming sea temperatures and sea turtles going extinct. Following school regulations, we've decided to suspend your son for two days. Right. But there must be another solution. It's a serious infraction. We had no choice. It will really put us out. My wife and I both work. What will we do with him for two days? Believe me, I'm sorry. We also think Gabriel should meet with a child therapist. What do you mean? We should look for the causes of his recent behavior. You mean a psychologist? We're not certain, but we think Gabriel is harassing a classmate of his. Harassing? Ever heard of bullying? No. It's a form of harassment among students. It usually starts with verbal humiliation. Nicknames, stuff like: "Four-eyes, Dumbo, Carrot..." It's only a suspicion, but we think your son should speak with our psychologist to determine to what extent he's a victim of this type of harassment. Victim? Guille. And forget the weekend. These two days will be no vacation, you got that? Gabriel. Are you listening to me? You're getting up tomorrow at 7 AM and coming to work with me. Here, your cell. Have you bought the kiwis for dinner Friday? -I'll go right away. -I can go if you want. You wouldn't mind? Why would I mind? He's such a sweet boy. All right. Is something wrong, ma'am? No, nothing. Hey. Bernie. The kidnappers sent it to me, but we can't tell Mom -or they'll kill him. -Gaby. Get moving. Gaby. Come with me to work if you want. No way. All morning doing nothing -in front of a computer? -Is that how it's going to be? Yes. He's coming with me, period. Sweetie, finish your cereal. That's it, pamper him. You'd think he made the Honor Roll. He said he didn't do it. And getting upset doesn't help. What, is it my fault he got suspended too? What's wrong with you? Nothing. Hurry up. Mom and I are a bit nervous, because we're worried. Look, Gaby. I'm not one of those dads who likes being friends with his kid. But tell me what's going on. -Nothing. -Something's wrong. Don't lie. -You're not taking stuff... -Stuff? I don't know. Drugs. -Shit, Dad. -Don't curse, fuck! -I'd kick your ass. -That's not it. Then what is it? Your teacher says you're out of it, you hit a classmate, and now you steal a cell phone. -I didn't steal it. -It was in your bag. Someone put it there. Is that true? -Yes. -Swear it. -I swear. -On your mother. I swear. Look at me. -Then what's wrong? -I don't like school. No shit, Gaby. I don't like coming here either, but I have to. -Morning, Joaqu?n. -Hi. Look, why don't you tell me what's wrong? Whatever it is, I'm sure the two of us can work it out. -Dad... -Tell me. Joaqu?n. Come here. Wait a second, I'll be right back. What, now you're babysitting too? -Problem with the kid. -Save it. The police station isn't finished. The inauguration is next week. -I've been doing house alarms. -The police station is priority. Yesterday it was the house alarms. Come again? -Nothing. -Good. Get your ass over there and connect the fucking camera control system. I can't yet. They have a software problem. Software, the ozone layer, I don't give a damn. Get over there and look like you're on it. Is that clear? -Is that clear? -Yes. Good. Because otherwise... We're not meeting our quarterly goals and somebody's got to go. If you know what I mean. Yes. Good, then get over there right now. What? You miss Carrot or what? Hey, let's make a video later. I'll pass. -Then tomorrow. -No way, I'll pass. -Why? -I said I'll pass, got it? -You're chickening out. -No, I'm not. -Yes, you are. -No, I'm just not doing it. Fine. Pussy. Call me that again and you're dead. You're hurting me. Let go. What, are you scared? Fucking let go! Are you nuts? Come on, I didn't squeeze that hard. -You're crazy. -Like you making videos. Son of a bitch. Drink your juice, sweetie. So Dad's got a busy morning. Yeah. You'll have fun here. You can surf the Internet. I have a taping but I won't be long. Okay. Dad and I did some talking. Did you? What about? -Merche, on set. -I'm coming. You can tell me later. Mom, I can't find my white T-shirt. Probably in the washer. No, it's already dry. -Is it for today? -Yeah. -I'll iron it for you right now. -Thanks, Tata. Gabriel Benavente? I know this is awkward, Gabriel. But we have to try to solve this little problem of ours. From my own professional experience, I know that it's best to be honest. We're not going to decide whether your behavior is right or wrong, but I would like to know one thing: When you hit your classmate, what did you feel? Right. Well, on Sundays I feel more nervous than usual. Right. Is that when you say you feel ill? I didn't just say it, I do feel ill. Right. Because you're going to see him, right? And what exactly are your symptoms? Dizziness? Throwing up? Headaches? I don't want to talk about this. Can I see them? No. -Why? -Because. Guille, the guests will be here at 9. Can you come down and say hello? If they ask how I am, can I say I'm seeing a shrink? -Guillermo, please. -What about Dad? Are you gonna tell him? Your dad has enough problems as it is. And I'm not sure someone's bullying you, so don't make me explain it all to him. I wouldn't advise it. Can I have dinner with you? Listen, Guille. I told you, these dinners are very boring. Nothing ever happens. I'd rather you weren't there. Maybe I could decide what I'm gonna do for myself sometime. You're already doing as you please. Come on, don't take it so hard. And I said, "You're the one picking up the tab, not me." How's your father, Magda? Better. I'll tell him you asked. The devil protects his own. By the way, I got a call to confirm your interview tomorrow on local television. Right, Velilla told me. You mean the local news program. -What's the anchor's name? -Mercedes Robles. Guillermo and her son are classmates. You'd better be on your toes. Of course, Julia. Always on the ball. Sometimes when things heat up you're dangerous. Well, you all know my position on Iraq hasn't changed. We made it clear that certain subjects are not subject to personal opinion. I have trouble separating my conscience from my political responsibilities. I don't think you quite understand the difference between conscience and party discipline. I'm sure the interview will go great. Mercedes is a responsible journalist. If not, Javier, her boss, -knows exactly who he works for. -Then that settles it. Nothing to be afraid of, right? Nothing. What about you? Spaghetti with cheese? -And tomato sauce. -Right. I think I have a temperature. He just doesn't want to go to school. You're going to school tomorrow or my name isn't Joaqu?n. Well, well. My favorite family. -Hi, Silverio. -How's it going? -Ready to order? -Yeah. For her spaghetti with cheese and for me a "Silver." I'll have a Four Seasons. Gabriel? For Gabriel, something I only make for VIP customers. The "Maradona Speciale." Go on, spoil him even more. It's to give him the strength he needs to go back to school. How about it? Perfect. If you like it, you come by one day and I explain you the secret of the "Maradona Speciale". -Thank you. -Good night. See you soon. Right. See you again. Thanks. Goodbye. -I missed you. -Me too. -How is that going? -What? -The psychologist. -Fine. I'm glad. You look happy. Yeah. I had a dream about you. What happened? You lost your cell phone. -Gaby. -What? Be careful. Since the Industrial Revolution technology has obviously been a deciding factor in developing new professions. I MISSED YOU, CARROT One moment, please. For next time pick one of your parents and write about their profession. We'll read them out loud. Now you can go. Javier. These are the questions I want to ask the councilman. Forget this. You'll talk about education and kids abusing alcohol. Period. Here with us tonight, the man in charge of public security, Guillermo Nieto, to discuss different aspects of his program for our city. -Welcome, Mr. Nieto. -Good afternoon. Not good afternoon! This is being aired at night. Oh, yes, that's right, you said that earlier. I'm sorry. -Shall we start over? -Let's start over. I think we should ask ourselves: Why do kids abuse alcohol? I think the answer is: To have fun. So let's offer them other ways to have fun. But civilized fun. And I don't only mean at school. We want parents to realize the importance of teaching kids at home. Parents... that means all of us... are partially to blame for what's happening. You yourself have a 14-year-old son, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, yes. It was a pleasure having you here, as usual. See you all next week. Thank you, Councilman. Thank you and good afternoon. Not good afternoon! -Right, sorry. Good night. -That's all right. I've never seen him like this. What did the psychologist say? -An anxiety attack, some diagnosis! -At least he knew what it is. Gaby said you two talked. -Well, yeah. -About what? I did the talking, Merche. He didn't say a word. You see? He doesn't even trust us enough to talk. Come on, don't exaggerate. I'm scared. Of what? Me too. It was a pleasure having you here, as usual. See you all next week. Thank you, Councilman. Good night. You were good. -You think? -Of course. By the way, Mom said the anchor's son is a classmate of yours. Yeah. But he hangs with another crowd. -You don't talk? -He's a bit weird. We call him "Carrot." -I mean they call him "Carrot." -Carrot? I remember in my class there was a kid we called by that name. Holy shit... Poor Carrot. We beat the crap out of him all the time. He even seemed to like it. Carrot. "So my mom ended up installing a GPS in the car, because she couldn't find any of her clients." That's all. "My dad has a degree in Psychology but he drives a taxi 14 hours a day and we never see him." "My dad is a lawyer, he defends people, though sometimes they're guilty." "My dad installs alarms..." That's enough, go on. "He does it because people are scared. Scared of getting robbed or hurt. Most of them have never been robbed or hurt, but more and more people are installing alarms. Other people are scared of getting fired, so when their boss yells at them they keep quiet. Having an alarm doesn't matter anyway. When you're scared, nobody hears it." Give me a hand. This is delicate. You have to be careful or the pasta will crack. Gabriel, know where they make the best pizza in the world? In Italy? That's what people think, but no. The best pizza in the world is made in Buenos Aires. Things are never as they seem. That's why my best pizza is called the "Maradona Speciale." Because Maradona is one of a kind. He passes every test life puts before him and resurfaces like a God. But he's like you and me. That's why people love him. Because he's living proof that anything is possible. So, where's the best pizza in the world? In Buenos Aires. That's right. I'm gonna show you something. Look. This was when Diego played for Naples. He taught me how to make the "Maradona Speciale." Why keep it in a drawer? Oh, Gabriel. I don't like to show off. For me discretion is important. Look here. This is from when Diego went to Cuba and re-emerged Like the Phoenix. If I ever disappear from the pizzeria, don't worry about me. I'll be toasting in the sun drinking a Mojito. Simply delightful. Simply delightful... It's for you. As we all know, this city is a safe place to live, but from now on, it'll be even safer. It's my honor to inaugurate this police station. Th is once again demonstrates that the department under my jurisdiction is working every day with perseverance, effort and hope to make good on the commitments we've made to all of our citizens. That's all. See you tomorrow. -Who fucking did this? -What is it? Some bastard put a pizza in my bag. -Damn, that's gross! -What kind of pizza? You'll eat anything. Ask your sister. I brought it to make you eat it, motherfucker. By yourself? He's even cocky... Just like your dad. Can't go anywhere alone. Record this! -You can't by yourself. -Shut the fuck up! Shut up! -Son of a bitch. -Guille... -I said record it! -Guille... This isn't cool, man. -I said shut up. -Stop! -Bastard! -Guille! -He's bleeding, stop! -Leave him alone. -He's bleeding a lot. -Okay, stop. I'll kill the bastard! Grab him by the arm! -Gaby! -In here. -What happened to you? -I'm okay, don't worry. -How did you do this? -Nothing happened. -Are you okay? -Yes. Calm down. What's going on, Gaby? Nothing, don't worry. Mom, I trust you. All I ask is that you do the same. You can't ask that of me. Trust me. Just one more time. You have to. Just one more time. I swear. I dig that little brunette in 2A. She'd be all over it. At least I'd be all over her. You wish. You'll see. All talk. Holy shit. Cool, huh? I bet your dad would like it too. Call me Carrot if you want, but fuck with me again and I'll show it around. -Look, if you send that... -What? Don't act brave, you're not like your dad. -What? -He has a bodyguard to protect him. And hanging with you protects them. -You mean my boys? -Your boys? You're worthless to them. So you three can take a hike or I'll send this. Is that clear? You see? Now I'm the one they're afraid of. Shit. Silverio! I don't see why you care. He got your face beat in. Thanks to him for the last time. It wasn't the best solution. It worked. What are you so worried about? Fear. Fear? What are you afraid of? What frightens me is your fear. I don't understand. I know. You could explain it to me. You should realize. I'm not into you anymore, Carrot. Find someone else to tape you getting beat up. Carla. This afternoon police mounted a sizable operation to detain mafia boss Guiliano Marini. For the last 8 years Giuliano Marini ran a known local pizzeria under the false name Silverio Fiorellino. Giuliano Marini, one of Europe's most wanted criminals, is accused of ordering several murders and has been linked to money laundering, extortion and drug trafficking. The wanted criminal escaped at the last minute and his whereabouts remain unknown... Can you explain it to me? If you 're worried I'll tell your father, you can relax. I'm not going to. You are. Mom. I'm sorry. Not as sorry as I am. Not even close. The surveillance cameras confirmed that your son visited the suspect often. -We're regulars. -We'd like to know if he shared any information with him. He's a boy. Go right ahead. Paco. I can't right now. Did Silverio at any time say anything you think we should know about? No. We just talked about Maradona. About Maradona? Why? -Was Silverio friends with Maradona? -I don't know. Are you sure? Because we found a photo of Maradona dedicated to Silverio. -Did you? -Yeah. So? How did that happen? I fell down the stairs. Is that true? Yes. He never ties his shoes and he tripped. One last question. Did Silverio say, by any chance, if he might go anywhere in particular? He talked about Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires? He said they have the best pizza in the world. Wow, I didn't know that. Shall we? I'll see you out.
