Romance comes to everyone At that certain age You'll find life Has just begun At that certain age All at once it hits you You know you're in love When that foolish feeling Fits you Just like a glove Nothing seems impossible All your dreams come true You're not held responsible For the things you do Wouldn't life be wonderful Delightfully insane If we always could remain At that certain age (MARCHING BAND PLAYING) Before we end this rally, I want to tell you about our summer camp plans. Every troop here today is going to camp, the dates fo be the first two weeks of next month. And troop number ten, which stated that some of its members could not find a way to go, is going to be with us. (ALL CHEERING) So, they better make their plan. And now I want to call Kenneth Warren, senior patrol leader of troop number one, to the microphone. One of the principles of the Boy Scouts of America and of all Boy Scouts, is to exhibit the friendliness and help that one man should extend toward another. Senior patrol leader Kenneth Warren knows this because he's a good scout. And as a good scout, when he heard that two troops couldn't go to summer camp, he decided to do something about it. Will you tell your plan to the other troops, Scout Warren? Well, scouts... Huh? Oh. Well, scouts, it's to put on a show like we did in our troop for the National Jamboree. And it's not our idea, and a good scout always gives credit where credit is due, and this time, the credit is due to Miss Alice Fullerton, who was in last year's show, presented and produced by troop number one. I think we should commend Miss Fullerton for this plan, fellow scouts. I want to patrol leaders of troop number one to act as an honor guard and bring her up here. Honor guard, approach! (DRUMS BEATING) Can I go with you? Can? Can I? I'm not moving from this spot. Oh, why? (ALL CLAMORING) Heaven's sakes, don't make them chase you. SCOUT: Miss Alice Fullerton, please. (DRUM BEATING CONTINUES) Hello. SCOUT: This way, please. No. (ALL PROTESTING) MAN: Go on, Alice. How do you do? Hello. You shouldn't have called me out. I was supposed to be taking my singing lesson and I just dropped by to see Kenneth. Mother will probably... Come on, say something. Oh. Say something. Well, there isn't very much to say except that troop number one and I are going to put on that show and nothing in the world's going to stop us. And we'll be very glad to doit. Now, fellow scouts, if you want to hear that new song, this is the time to hear it. (ALL CHEERING) Go on, sing. Go on, you know it. Yes, please. (BAND PLAYING) (SINGING) Be a good scout And always wear a smile Be a good scout Keep cheerful all the while It's the creed, yes indeed That a scout must Practice gaily Help those in need Do a good turn daily Be a good scout Be loyal, clean and brave Never say die Just let your banners wave On your honor, do your best When they put you To the test And always be a good scout (ALL SINGING) Be a good scout And always wear a smile (WHISTLING) Be a good scout Keep cheerful all the while It's the creed, yes indeed That a scout must Practice gaily Help those in need Do a good turn daily Be a good scout Be loyal, clean and brave Never say die Just let your banners wave On your honor, do your best When they put you To the test And always be a good scout Yes, always Be a good scout MR. FULLERTON: Very cute. Very cute. Print it in the Roto section. Yes, sir. Mr. Fullerton? Yeah? Shall we call her Alice or Miss Alice Fullerton, this time? Alice. She's sill only a baby. Yes, sir. Well, now that I've settled that important question... Hmm? What are we gonna do about this new League of Nations business they started? Not much until we know more about its chances. We'll know all about it just as soon as Bullit gets here. Any word from Bullit yet? WOMAN: Not yet, Mr. Fullerton. His boat docked at noon. You told me that before. Check the city room, see if he's there. WOMAN: Yes, Mr... (PAPER SCRUNCHING) Hmm. That's a pretty sloppy front page they gave us in Trenton this morning. Wire Carsden as follows. "Four crime stories on page one is a poor dish "to give our readers for breakfast." And notify Salt Lake. No three-column pictures of anyone on page one except the morning after a national election. Well, where's Bullit? I don't know, his boat, docked at noon... At noon. That's no longer news. We had an ambulance there. Well, where's the ambulance now? Down in front. Bullit put his bags in and disappeared. We'll go find him. We'll try, Mr. Fullerton. I don't mind him disappearing for 15 days last month in Spain. You expect that sort of thing when a man's covering a war, but no one's declared war in Manhattan. Or have they? Well, maybe he has amnesia, Mr. Fullerton. MR. FULLERTON: Oh, amnesia. Only bank tellers and lodge treasurers have amnesia, my boy. MAN: Hello, Mr. Bullit. Boy, have they been hunting for you. Well, here I am, kid. JOHN: Bullit! VINCENT: Hello, John. Bullit, I finally see you. How's the wound? Not very... Hello, Vince. Hello, Ted, how are you? Swell. Let's see where you got shot. Oh, costs two bits a look, boys. Hello, Bullit, glad to see you. MAN 3: Hello, Bullit, how are you? Greetings. Where's Grace? Cuba. Cuba? Doing what? Covering that new election. Oh. How is she doing? Swell. The boss has been asking for you. Vincent. Well, well, well. Glad to see you. Good to see you, Gil. Oh, boy, it's good to be home Well, you never said that before. You must be getting old. No, I'm all right. The world's getting old. Still playing hopscotch, huh? Say, do you know I've been waiting for you since 12:00? I walked up from the boat, that's why I'm late. Oh, now, you shouldn't have done that. Now, sit down, sit down and rest yourself. Still running a fever? A little bit. We've big things to talk about, Vin. Big things. Such as a big scotch and a big soda? No, not exactly. But such as whether you ought to go to China. China? Yeah. Well, suits me. I'l go by way of Cuba. Hey, hey, not so fast. You don't leave for three weeks. Oh, a vacation. That's just what I need. Well, it's not exactly a vacation, but you'll get plenty of rest while you're doing it. Martin? MARTIN: Yes, Mr. Fullerton? Get the advertising ready to promote a series of articles by Bullit on the European situation. MARTIN: Yes, Mr. Fullerton. Make it the biggest thing that's happened in the last 20 years. VINCENT: Rest, eh? I do these articles in my sleep, I suppose. No, no, no. You do 'em at my place in the country. Oh, no, I don't. I do 'em where it's nice and quiet. Oh, it's nice and quiet in the country. With four dinner parties a week? At least two dances at the country club. Somebody asking you to play tennis every 10 minutes. Bridge all night. Riders, golfers, swimmers, all begging you to make an athletic idiot of yourself. No, thank you. I'll get my peace and quiet at 42nd Street and Broadway. No, no, I have just what you need up there. What I need is a good steak every night smothered in chorus girls, some excitement, some lights, some music. And some happy people. No, no, Vin, you're not well enough for that. Besides, I want to talk to you about these things. Vin, you're the only man in the world that can write what I want. You're the only man that can tell the American people what they want to know. You've seen it or you understand it or you can make it clear to them. You can make them live it with you. This isn't only an assignment. This is a patriotic duty. Get Mrs. Fullerton on the phone, please. (INTERCOM BUZZING) Hello, dear. Now look, dear. I'm bringing Bullit home with me. Yes. Yes, he'll have the guesthouse. No, no, no, no, no, no. No parties. Just peace and quiet. (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING LES FILLES DE CADIX) George, we may need your help, too. Mr. Fullerton wants the guest house made ready at once. GEORGE: What about the leaves? Leave them. (SINGING RESUMES) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Quiet. Quiet everybody. Quiet please. Alice, that was swell. Oh, Ken, should I pick up the rose? Well, no. Let's see. You step on it, slap his face and call him a cad, like this. You cad! See what I mean? I see. I step on it, slap his face and call him a cad. Right. You cad! Like that? That's it. But when you say, "You cad!" a little more feeling, like this. "You cad!" Now, you see? Now look, Tony. You saw me before. It's very simple. You look at her, you throw the flower, and then you get up. That's what I did before. I looked at her, I threw the flower and I got up, didn't 1? Yeah, sure, you looked, you threw, you got up. Any other director would okay it, but me, I can't You've got to have more life in it. It's got to be real. You must look at her. You must throw the flower at her. You must get up and let her know that your heart is breaking. Aw, mush! Sis, will you please go home and study your part? Butch, you ought to learn your lines. My line? I've got one thing to say. "Oh." I know how to say "Oh." (SHOUTING) Quiet, please. Quiet! All right, kids. Come on. In places now. Let's go. Take all these things off this bed here. And you sweep up the room. George, come with me. (VACUUM WHIRRING) Wonder what's that? I don't know. (ALL CLAMORING) Please don't... We're working on the show. Yes, Miss Alice, I know But I'm afraid you'll have to find another theater. We can't. We have everything in here now. Miss Alice, there's a guest arriving here this evening. Here? Yes, Miss Alice. Here. There must be some mistake. There's no mistake. Your mother told me to have this place ready by 5:00. George, take down those drapes. (ALL PROTESTING) (TUTTING) There's no such a thing. I'm gonna find out about this. KEN: Okay. Stevens, the show is very important. MAN: You bet it is. I know, I know. George, take down those drapes. KEN: No, wait... (ALL PROTESTING) Stop it! Stop it! Alice said no, now stop it! Stop... Stop barking at me, child! I'm not barking. You were barking. I was, huh? Well now I'm biting. (ALL CHEERING) (STEVENS HOWLS) Mother? Mother? DOROTHY: Yes, dear. Mother! What's wrong? You haven't hurt yourself, have you? What do you know what Stevens said? He said that you told him to get the guest house ready for a guest and that we were to stop rehearsing. Now, isn't that ridiculous? No, dear. It's true. I'm sorry. Your father just phoned. Oh, but Mother, humiliating me in front of my friends, that's awful. That's better than humiliating your father in front of his guest, dear. Well, who is the guest? Mr. Bullit. Well, isn't he good enough to stay in the house? You have eight spare rooms and besides the cottage is damp, and the screen's broken. I broke it today. Sorry, darling. Your father's orders. Mr. Bullit is to have the guesthouse and we're to give him absolute peace and quiet while he is here. Oh, but Mother, please. No buts, darling. If he doesn't have peace and quiet, he'll go running back to New York. But... Why, he'll go back? Yes, he will and we don't want that now, do we? Oh, no, no. And of course he would go back if he didn't have peace and quiet, wouldn't he? Thank you. He'll come down the main drive, you all hide in the bushes, and I'll be with him. Wouldn't be easier to move the whole show over to Mary Lee's? (ALL EXCLAIMING) We've got everything all mapped out, now let's not start changing it. (CAR HONKS) We better move our stuff. Yes, but don't move it too far. Okay, then get going. Come on, get back. All of you. Tony, I'm gonna stick around here and kind of watch things. All right. You stay here and sort of watch things. (SARCASTICALLY) Hello, Miss Things. (CAR STARTING) Come on, Butch If they're coming, hurry up. I'm coming and if they get fresh I'll bite their ears off. Now go on, will ya? Ken, I better go up and get ready. Oh, Alice. Yes, Ken. What is it? I just want to say, I think you're swell to go to all this trouble and everything. Oh, it's no trouble at all. My daddy says that when you start something, you have to finish it. Well, your dad's right. Yes, but he hasn't much consideration for me. Oh, well, I suppose he means all right. He's just busy. Ken Warren, you're not sticking up for him, are you? Oh no, Alice. How could you say that? Why, I'm always on your side, and well, I always will be if you want me to be. Sure, I do. Ken, this show is important. Oh, I don't just mean it about the show. I mean about, well... About, you know, for... For along time. Like forever. Forever? That is a long time, isn'tit? I mean it. (HESITATING) Well, Ken... Well, I do, I guess. Do you, Allie? No fooling? Yes, Ken. Ken, come on. Hurry up. We can't get Dracula started and you've gotta crank it. Well, go ahead, Ken. I'd better go up and get ready anyway. Goodbye. Goodbye. BUTCH: Ken, come on. She says they're coming up the road. Everybody duck, come on. Load up. Take Mr. Bullit's things into the guesthouse, will you please? BUTLER: Yes, sir. Well, here we are. Far from the maddening crowd's ignoble uproar. Must you rub it in? Fire! (BLOWS) Ouch! Mosquitoes, too. Oh, don't be pig-headed. Forget the mosquitoes and listen to those katydids. They must use Tommy guns. And smell the good Earth. (BOTH INHALE) (EXHALES) All right, I've smelled it. Let's goin. DOROTHY: Hello, darling. How sweet. Mr. Bullit, welcome home. Thank you, Mrs. Fullerton. And this is the baby. Well, well, well. Elsie, isn't it? Alice, not Elsie. Oh, I beg your pardon. I met you in Paris, remember? You got off the train, gave me a big hug and kiss and called me Daddy. Oh, how silly. I must have been a very little girl then. Mmm-hmm. So big. But you're still a little girl, darling. You're gonna love it here, Vin. It's just what you need. Fire! (BLOWS) Ouch! Um, just bugs. VINCENT: Hungry bugs. MR. FULLERTON: Perhaps I'd better take you to your room. Oh, Daddy, let me take him to the guesthouse. All right, darling Go ahead. Right this way, Mr. Bullit. See you later. Dinner when you're ready. You're up. Get your aim. I think you'll find the guest house is lovely. So silly of the servants to be superstitious about it being haunted. Doggone it! Don't those bugs or mosquitoes or whatever they are, bother you? No, they only pick on strangers. Ow! Yeah. They're picking on you now. Come on, let's hurry. Ouch! (EXCLAIMS) You're not afraid? Afraid? Of ghosts? Of course I don't believe in them. Do you? I don't know. I'm not trying to frighten you. It's just that, since that thing happened with my music teacher, everybody talks about the guesthouse. What thing? She went crazy, you know? She was very sad at first. Whenever she played the piano, she always used the black keys. Then one night at midnight, she passed on. Of course, that was after she hung herself. Hanged herself. Yes, hung herself. Well, anyway, hung or hanged, it happened here in the guesthouse, eh? Mmm-hmm. Cheerful. And you two know where to go? Yeah. Bill, you know where to go? Yeah. yeah. Okay. step up. Come on, let's go. Now she does a bit of haunting, does she? Oh, I've never seen her, but then I've never looked for her. But the servants say that that's why everything goes wrong in the guest house. Now, you don't believe silly things like that, do you? No, of course not. I guess I just mentioned it for conversation. Ouch! Oh, don't pay any attention to that. Holy smoke! Perfect. Thank you very much. Now, you run on back. Oh no, I think I better show you where things are first. Here we have the... Isn't this cozy? Yes, very. Now that's the bedroom and there's the fireplace, and that's... And here's the piano. (CHUCKLES) All right, I'll see at dinner. Oh, Mr. Bullit? Hmm? Would you mind very much, uh... I, uh... I hate to come over here alone. And I should catch up on some practicing, and, so if you wouldn't mind I'd... Do you play the piano? No, I sing. Oh, you sing. Uh-huh. (CLEARS THROAT) Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll go and change. (DOOR CLOSES) (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (ALICE WARMING UP HER VOICE) Ma-mi Ralalalalala (VOCALIZING) Looking for something? Yes, a piece of rope. A piece of rope? I'm beginning to think maybe your music teacher wasn't so crazy when she hung herself. Pretty smart woman. BOTH: He's mad, now. She's got his goat. (ALL HOWLING) (ALICE CONTINUES VOCALIZING) (ALL HOWLING) Fire! (BLOWING) Ouch! (ALICE CONTINUES VOCALIZING) (VOCALIZING) (HOWLING) ALICE: Merrily, merrily Merrily, merrily, merrily, may (GROANING) (METAL CREAKING) Merrily, merrily Merrily, merrily, merrily, may May, may, may (PLAYS PIANO) Merrily, merrily Merrily, merrily, merrily, may Hey, Tony, get going with the skunks. (ALICE CONTINUES VOCALIZING) (ROARS) (ALICE SHRIEKS) Well, I was just... I know you were just telling them to bring the skunks in. But how did you know... I know the Morse Code too, young lady. Now I'm going to tell them something. Oh, I wouldn't if I were... You're going to keep right on singing those scales or there will be a ghost around here and it will be yours. Go on, sing. Come on in I can't tell you now. Something went wrong. Hey, Tony, Come on. Butch, come here. Bill. ALL: What's the matter? Well, something must have happened. We got to go inside. (ALICE SINGING) ALL: I'm not going in. BUTCH: Neither me. Well, we can't leave her alone in there. Come on. We'll go in. We'll just be quiet. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) KEN: Allie? Allie? Alice, you want us? (IMITATING ALICE) Yes, hurry up. KEN: Where are you? We're right here. Can't see you. (INDISTINCT WHISPERS) (GIRL SCREAMING) You're the worst bunch of ghosts I ever saw in my life. Now, sit down, all of you. Now, which one of you kept pecking away at the back of my neck? I did, sir. Stand over there. Look, Mr... Sit down. Mr. Bullit... I'l get to you later. Sit down. Mr. Bullit, let me tell you what happened. No, let me tell him, Ken. We have nothing personal against you. No, nothing personal at all. No, you just don't like me. No, we just want to get rid of you. BOY: Yeah, that's right. Oh, I see. Nothing personal. You just want to get rid of me. ALL: Yeah. Well, let me tell you something. That's exactly what I want myself, to get out of here as soon as possible. But your father has different ideas. Well, look, Mr. Bullit, maybe we can help you. ALL: Yeah. How? Well, now let me think. We can bring you over to Evelyn Sullivan's house, and maybe you can catch the measles, she's got them and... VINCENT: I'm afraid that'd take too long. Wait a minute. What about a dying friend? (EXCITED CHATTER) Uh, have you got a dying friend? (ALL SIGH) Now, wait a minute. If I could only get a call from a New York hospital. Oh, we could do that. We did a hospital play once. ALL: Yeah! There's been an accident, see? My friend calls for me. Maybe my presence will save his life. Oh, we can do that, but good. I don't know. My father is pretty smart. Yeah. Too smart at times. That will take more than a telephone call. There'd have to be a telegram. First the phone call, and then the wire. "Leonard's sinking fast." But that wire must come from New York. My father has a direct wire to his New York office. That's swell! You send the telegram. And we'll get working on that hospital scene. Come on, gang, over to my house. About what time do you want us to call? In about two hours. That doesn't give us much time, but we'll make it. KEN: Back at quarter after. ALICE: Don't be late. I won't, Allie. Oh, Mr. Bullit, I think you're just... Well, you're just perfect. Now, do me a favor. Will you get me a glass of water? Yes. And a little brown pill bottle out of my small bag. Are you sick? No, I'm all right. Just a little fever. Oh, now you stay right there. Let me get them. Now, don't think. (WATER RUNNING) Here you are. You better take them right away. Thank you. Water. Oh, I'm sorry. I'l get some... (MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY) There. Feel better now? Much. Uh, Mr. Bullit, we would never have done those things we did to you if we'd known you had a fever. Honest, we wouldn't. Well, just you don't say anything about this to your father and you're forgiven. Oh, I won't. Uh, well, you better rest now and I'll go and unpack. I think I can do that. No. You have to be very quiet when you have a fever and rest, otherwise the fever will go up. Oh, I see. All right, I'll rest. Oh, I wouldn't smoke either, if I were you. I'll just... Just sort of relax and take it easy. Are you comfortable? You want a pillow? No. I'll go and get you unpacked. How are we coming? Fine, thank you. I thought you were in the other room, resting. I'm all cured. You're a wonderful nurse. Oh, you still look feverish. You better sit down. Maybe you have the flu. I had it last year. No, no. It's just a little infection. An infection? Well, isn't that very bad? Mmm-mmm. The doctor in Spain said it would clear up all by itself. In Spain? Oh, you're the man from Daddy's newspaper that got shot covering the war. Oh, that's terrible. It wasn't anything personal. Everybody was shooting at everybody else, and I stuck my leg out. Your leg? Well, doesn't it hurt? Mmm-mmm. No, it's all right, see? (STOMPS FOOT) Don't you that. You might hurt yourself. No, really, it's all right, but listen, if we're going to get that phone call from a dying friend, I'd better get dressed. But... Now you run along and thanks for everything. But, Mr. Bullit, I... I wanted to apologize. Oh, no. Don't bother. I'd feel silly if you did. But... Really, it was fun. We must do it again sometime. But, really... Sick and... Well, ought to have someone... Shot in the war... Alone. Of course, it was the kind of thing you would expect to happen during a war, but I must admit, I felt a little mystified when she sent for me. It's a pity you didn't pick up some beautiful shawls while you were there. Oh, Mother, shawls? What happened to Miss X? Was she really the head of the whole spy system? Well, that's what they said when they shot her in the morning. Now, tell me, Vince, was she a royal princess? She was to me. She gave me the story. You know, dear, before she faced the firing squad on that cold morning, her last wish was to see Vince. And there, in her little cell, she told him the whole story. And I told it to the whole world for two weeks. A princess... MR. FULLERTON: What a story. I remember. My, it was breathtaking. Breathtaking? You wait till you see the series of articles Bullit's going to write now. Super breathtaking they'll be. What a life. What a glorious life you have. You see Cairo and Cathay. You have all the fun. I own the newspapers, and what do I have? But you have me, dear, and Alice Yes, Mother? Oh, excuse me. Telephone, sir. It's New York, and very urgent. Oh. Hello? Hello? Yes, yes, this is Mr. Fullerton speaking. General Hospital speaking. General Hospital speaking. Hello? Mr. Fullerton on the wire? I'l connect you with the head nurse. (CLICKING) This is head nurse Murphy speaking. Mr. Fullerton, we're trying to locate a Mr. Bullit. Emergency case. (CLICKING) I'l connect you with the operating room. This is Dr. White speaking. Yes, a man named Leonard Martingale, hit by a bus. Yes, he had a letter in his pocket. (DEEPENS VOICE) Had a letter in his pocket signed by Vincent Bullit. Yes, he keeps calling for him. Quite serious. (SCREAMING) (SHUSHING) We don't need any ambulance in here. Have you a friend by the name of Leonard Martingale? Sure, is he on the phone? No, it's the hospital. I can't very well tell what they're saying. There's a lot of yelling and screaming going on, but he seems to be hurt. Hello? Bullit speaking. Oh, oh, that's bad. Still under the anesthetic? Yes, I'll be right here if you want me. Well, now, listen, you wire me the moment he regains consciousness if he needs me. Right. Gosh. Poor old Leonard. Is he an old friend of yours? Hmm. Funny, I thought of him just this afternoon. Funny? MR. FULLERTON: Oh, it's probably not really as bad as that. First reports, you know? VINCENT: Yeah, and Leonard's pretty tough. That's one thing in his favor. Shall we have coffee in the other room? Yes. Who would ever have thought that poor old Lenny would be the victim of a crosstown bus? Well, try not to be disturbed, Vincent. We'll know in a little while how he's getting on. Yes, that's true. (WHISPERING) Now is the time to send that telegram. Say "Martingale sinking fast. Come at once. Dr. White." "Martingale sinking fast. Come at once. Dr. White." Hello, is this The Globe operator? This is Alice Fullerton. Would you connect me with Western Union, please? I want to send a telegram. (DOROTHY PLAYING PIANO) You have pianos all over the place, haven't you? Dorothy and Alice are very musical. Alice sings. Really? I never would have thought so. (CHUCKLES) (PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES) ALICE: (SINGING) You're as pretty as a picture Has anyone ever told you before? You're the image of an angel from above And you were just meant for me to adore You're the model of perfection The others are only copies of you Can't you see the only thing that worries me I wonder if you're too good to be true Your eyes, your hair You're a perfect color scheme You're much too fair You must have stepped out of a dream You're as pretty as a picture A beautiful exhibition of art When I say you fairly take my breath away Just picture what you have done to my heart Your eyes, your hair You're a perfect color scheme You're much too fair You must have stepped out of a dream You're as pretty as a picture A beautiful exhibition of art When I say you fairly take my breath away Just picture what you have done to my heart Bravo! That's an old family custom. Every night, Alice has to sing for her supper. She does it well, too. You ought to feed her better. Hmm? Not make her eat chocolate ice cream when everybody else is having crépes Suzette. There, you see, Mother? People do notice. Kenneth coming over tonight, darling? Kenneth? Coming here, you mean? No, no, of course not. And who is Kenneth? He replaced Lord Byron, Alice's former sweetheart. ALICE: Daddy! Oh, you'll have a chance to meet him. Telegram, sir, for Mr. Bullit. You read it, Gil, I know it's bad news. Oh, it's from Leonard. Well, I suppose I might as well start packing at once and get right down there. Excuse me. Wait a minute. There's nothing to worry about. He says, "Feeling much better. "Stay where you are and rest. You need it. "I'm all right. Love, Leonard." He seemed to take a turn for the better, didn't he? Yeah. I can't understand it. (CHUCKLES) I had a feeling he was going to be all right. So did I, my dear. I don't know. Sounds to me like the sort of case that might have serious complications. It's amazing. Well, I'm certainly glad that he's better for your sake, Mr. Bullit. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed now. Good night, Mother. Good night, darling. Good night, Daddy. Good night, dear. Good night, Mr. Bullit. Good night. That's the first time she's gone to bed without being driven upstairs in months. She's a very surprising child in many ways. Yeah. Many, many ways, I should imagine. I wish I had six just like her. Six? Mmm-hmm. Yes, Mr. Bulli, I know I did it, and I'm sorry. Oh, yes, I had a reason for doing it. I had a good many reasons for doing it. You were wonderful not to give me away. Why did I do it? Well, now, Mr. Bullit, you know you're not very well, and, you know, if you went to New York, you wouldn't take very good care of yourself. Well, Mr. Bullit, thank you for letting me call you Vincent. Well, Vincent, we just want to take care of you. What else? That's the whole story. Mother, Daddy and I just want to take care of you. Well, I know I should have told you, and I apologize for doing it the way I did, but well, I did do it for your own good. I do wish you'd forgive me. Please. VINCENT: I ought to break your neck. Hmm? You're a traitor. I thought it... A wolf in sports clothing. Oh, no, Vince... Um, Mr. Bullit. I was only trying to save you from your own recklessness. And who appointed you my guardian angel? Oh, well, don't you see? If you left and anything happened to you, Daddy would never forgive me for making you go away, so, lonly... DOROTHY: Good morning. Oh, good morning, Mother. Good morning. Mr. Bullitand I were just talking. Yes, very interesting, too. Oh, Alice is a great little old chatterbox. Very ambitious, too, this morning. Picking flowers and looking so pretty. Just like a little angel. Who are they for, darling? Oh, they're for... They're for you, Mother. Oh, how thoughtful. Don't you think it'd be nice to put some in Mr. Bullit's room? Oh, yes. Yes, I do. Don't they draw mosquitoes? Oh, no. No, they don't. Well, goodbye. Come on, Apollo Belvedere. Oh, I wish I had six just like her. Six, huh? Mmm. That makes an even dozen. (CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY) Oh, hello. I was just fixing some flowers I got from the garden. Well, what happened last night? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? You got the phone call, didn't you? Oh, that phone call? Yeah, that phone call. (SIGHS) You certainly don't think my father was fooled by that for a minute, do you? Well, didn't the telegram cinch it? Oh, the telegram. Holy smokes. That telegram was the whole idea. Well, they weren't fooled by the phone call, what good would the telegram do? What happened? Nothing much. Why were you putting all those flowers around for? I have to do what my mother tells me. Stop picking on her, Tony. It's not her fault. Look, if he stays tonight, I know where they got some swell, fat hop toads we can put in his bed. No, we can't do that. He's wounded. He was shot in Spain. Well, he certainly shot our play to pieces. Well, we can always rehearse over at Mary Lee's. They haven't got any shot up guests. We'd love to have you. Oh, I don't know. It's bad luck to change rehearsal places. ALL: That's right. You think he's going to go away today? Well, I don't know exactly, Ken. But I'll tell you what I can do for you kids. He and mother are out riding, and maybe I can join them, and well, talk to him about things. ALL: Good idea. Yeah, that's perfect. KEN: Good idea. I'll be back in a minute. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Couldn't you rehearse at Mary Lee's? Well, you know what that means. She'll want to be in the show. Why don't you let her bein it? But Alice, she wants to play your part, Lady Iris. Sometimes I wonder if it's all worthwhile. All what's worthwhile? All this. Wouldn't it be better to just sit under a tree and think? Think? About what? The whole world is a playground. Instead of this bit of Greensford called home. I don't know what you're talking about. You're over my head. Well, nothing matters when you're very young, I guess. All right, Grandma. Now don't be silly. You know, Ken, there is such a thing in this world as peace. Real peace. So what? So there's peace. Yesterday, you wanted to tear down the place ‘cause they were interfering with the show. Now, today, you talk like this. I don't get you. I'm torn between two fires. Two fires? Hey, Allie. I mean, Alice. What? You haven't sort of changed your mind about... Well, you know what I mean. About anything, have you? Look, Ken, I need a friend now. You need a friend? You've got a million friends. (SIGHS) Goodbye, Kenneth. It's been lovely talking to you. Wait a minute. Where are you going? (SIGHS) Who knows? Perhaps to Cairo and Cathay. But you haven't answered my question yet. You haven't changed your mind about anything, have you? Oh, now. The show will be all right. I don't mean about the show. I'm just trying... Cairo and Cathay? (HORSES GRUNTING) Uh-oh! I'm afraid you're in for it, Vincent. What is it, a posse? No, it's just the girls. They're dying to meet you. They love celebrities. And to think I woke a horse up at 9:00 in the morning for this. (WOMEN CLAMORING) WOMAN 1: Are you Mr. Vincent Bullit? I met you in Washington, remember? DOROTHY: Oh, just a minute, girls! Please, girls, just a minute. Now, may I present, Mrs. Lars, this is Mr. Bullit. And Mrs. K, this is Mr. Bullit. MRS. K: How do you do, Mr. Bullit? And Mrs. Spencer-Jones, this is Mr. Bullit. And Mrs. Randolph... I'am Mr. Bullit. (ALL CHATTERING) We're having a paperchase this afternoon, and you're just the man we need. DOROTHY: Oh, no, dear, I am very sorry. WOMAN 2: Don't keep him all to yourself. DOROTHY: Indeed not. I'm sorry, I really don't know anything about Spanish lace. Well, come and see mine, then you will. 4:00? I'll expect you. WOMAN: 4:00 is the tea. He'd better be there. WOMAN 2: And my husband, I know you'll find a lot to talk about. WOMAN 3: Bring him to the tennis club, Dot. You do play tennis? Well, I prefer croquet. WOMAN 4: Good. Take you on in an hour. WOMAN 5: And I do want you to see the moving pictures we took in Norway, Mr. Bullit. Come on! Help, Mother, help! Oh, it's Alice. It's Alice! Help! Help! Help! Help! (ALICE SIGHS) What evil star ever made me run into you? Where am I? You are sitting on my chest. Will you please get off? Oh, I guess I must have fainted. You're still sitting on my chest. Oh. (VINCENT EXHALES) Are you hurt? No, let's call it "discouraged." Suppose you take the two horses and leave me right where I am. Here's where I stay. May the rains fall and the snows pile deep, never tell 'em where you left me. Never. Have I done something wrong again? Well, it's not avery right idea to get on a large, powerful horse when you don't know how to ride. Oh, I can ride. I did that on purpose. You what? Mmm-hmm. Where's my riding crop? Oh, but I did it to rescue you. You see, now that you've escaped, you don't have to do all those things that they wanted you to. But that's wonderful. Wait a minute. This isn't another one of your tricks? Oh, no, it is not. I swear itisn't. I'll never betray you again. Not for anything. I got you into this mess. Well, I want to help you out of it if you'll only let me. Let you? A drowning man clutches at a razor. I had to do something about the croquet game and those pictures from Norway. I just couldn't stand by and let you in for all that. And all those other women, it was just too awful. Did I call you a razor? Mmm-hmm. You're a dream girl. Oh, thank you, Mr. Bullit. I think under the circumstances, you might call me Vincent. Thank you, Vincent. (SIGHS) Just perfect. I tell you, she's been giving us the runaround for the last three days. Go on. She's just trying to get rid of him. By taking him fishing and bicycle riding? That's a swell way to get him out. Well, her mother makes her do that. Is she coming to the emergency committee's meeting this afternoon? No, she can't. She's got to go to the dentist and have her teeth cleaned. She has to do anything but see us. She can't help it if she has to go to the dentist. You don't suppose she likes to have her teeth cleaned, do you? Here, it's your turn. Use your own side. Okay. What's that you putting on? Witch hazel. Takes the smart out of it. Help yourself. (KNOCK AT DOOR) BUTCH: Ken? Ken? Ken? What do you think I saw just now? What's the idea busting in when two men are in a bathroom? I'm sorry. But you know what it was that I saw. Well, tell us, tell us. Well, I saw Alice and that man and where do you think they were? Where? At the Mount Kisco Village Inn, shooting pool. The dentist, huh? You're a sap. Did she see you? Oh, no. She couldn't be bothered seeing anybody but Vincent. Vincent? So she calls him Vincent? Never mind what she calls him. Where are you going? To get Mary Lee. I'll go with you. No, you stay here and clean my razor. Tony, you round up the emergency committee. Oh. Oh, for heaven's sake! Ken? Ken? He forgot to put the blade in again. TONY: Go on, clean it up. Clean it up. Oh, too bad! I'l slap this up against three cushions and send it rolling home. (VINCENT CLEARS THROAT) Ah, you even shoot a better game than Daddy. That's what your daddy owns the newspapers and I work for them. My skill, young lady, is an indictment of reckless and misspent youth. Rack 'em up. Now, then, let's see. You owe me $125,000 from pinochle. $86,000 from checkers. I lost $60,000 at ping-pong. You lost 25,000 on this game, right? That's right. That means that your net loss is $176,000. Mmm-hmm. That's right. Well what about it? Double or nothing. Okay, double or nothing. Your break. Hi, Allie. KEN: Hello, Mr. Bullit. VINCENT: Hello. Didn't know you were still around. Well, she's responsible. She double-crossed me. For my own good, of course. You know how women are. Oh, I say I do. Well, Dad insisted that he finish some articles before he left, so... MARY: Oh! Are you helping your father run his newspapers? Why, I think that's real cute. VINCENT: But she's really helping me. So what are the articles about? Pool? (LAUGHS) No, but that's an idea. They're about world affairs. The biggest kind of news. Say, I have got some news for you, too. Mary Lee is gonna play Lady Iris. Me? Yeah, I finally coaxed her into it. Oh, that's fine! That's fine... You know, Mr. Bullit, you can stick around as long as you like now. I mean, we've got anew rehearsal hall and we're all set and everything. VINCENT: Yeah, that's fine. Yes, and we've got to get busy, too. MARY: And we don't want to interrupt your game. Won't you go ahead and play? Don't mind us. Your shot, Vince. Just stick around and watch a master. Now this is a very, very difficult shot. Mind if I try it? It's a tough shot. Thank you very much. Come on over when you get through. I'll buy you a beer. He must sleep on a pool table. He's just showing off. My father taught him that on our table. And her pretending he was going. I'm really excited. All right, let's go to work. Charge it, Cappy. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. You know what your ma told me. Please, Cappy. Charge it. CAPPY: All right. All right. By the way, a doubleheader for the young lady and a root beer for the gentleman at the pool table. So long, Allie! Going to rehearsal. VINCENT: So long! Anything you want, it's on me. The best in the house. Now there's what I call a real gent. He's just being childish. His play and showing off. A doubleheader chocolate for you, Alice. For me? Oh, I don't want that. All want is a glass of water. Why, I' haven't had an ice cream cone, well, for years at least. Is that for me? Fine. So, listen, bring me one of those... What do you call 'em? Uh, double-jumbo. You know, covered with walnuts, chocolate ice cream, banana split. My Bullit's very attractive, isn't he? I guess so. Yeah, sure, sure. He's very nice. He's swell. You know, you're pretty swell yourself, Ken. Forget it, you're doing me the favor. No. I don't mean about the play, Ken. Well, I do. I want it to be real good. It's my last one. Is it? Why? Well, I can't very well come back and put on kids shows when I'm going in the Navy. Ken! Are you going to Annapolis? Oh, Annapolis is just going to school. I'm going in the Navy. To see the world? Sure, Cairo, Cathay... And that's China. And every place. China? Oh, Ken, you're not. Yes lam. But don't go spreading it around, will you? Oh, no, I won't tell a soul. I mean, I don't want alot of fuss and a lot of goodbyes. She might think that's childish, too. MARY: You know what, Ken? I know we better get to that rehearsal, Lady Iris. MARY: Lady Iris. Who'd have ever thought I'd be that? Ken? You're simply, stupendously wonderful. I think you're adorable. Oh, you can save that stuff for Tony. I'm I'm disillusioned about women. Oh, Ken. (BOTH SINGING) Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do I'm half crazy all for the love of you itwon't be a stylish marriage I can't afford a carriage But you'll look sweet upon the seat Of a bicycle built for two (VINCENT EXCLAIMS AND APPLAUDS) Oh! How about Sweet Adeline? Ooh. After root beer? No, no That would never do. Well, what else do you know? I know a secret. Oh, you gonna keep it? Mmm, that depends on you. On me? Mmm-hmm. It's your secret. Oh, no, I haven't any secrets. Well, maybe these old eyes of mine deceive me, but I don't think so. You're crazy about somebody, young lady. Oh. You weren't supposed to know about that. (VINCENT CHUCKLES) I guess you think it's silly at my age. VINCENT: Oh, on the contrary, I think it's very nice. You aren't joking? About such a sacred matter? No. It is sacred. But still, I... It makes me feel very young again. Oh, but you're not old. Are you? Well, today I'm not. I'm young! I ride on a bicycle, I eat banana splits. (ALICE CHUCKLES) And I see young love in a young lady's eyes. Well, when did you first suspect me of it? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) When he told you she was going to play Lady Iris. When he told me? VINCENT: Mmm-hmm. But how did that make you... VINCENT: Well, I don't know, but I could see you were crazy about him. And he was pretty keen about you, too. He's a nice boy, your Kenneth. Yes, Kenneth is a very nice boy. And don't let that other girl bother you. That was just an act to make you jealous. I see. You know all about it, huh? VINCENT: Sure, I'm an expert. And as an expert, I predict that everything is gonna turn out all right in the end. (SINGING) Alice, Alice, give him your answer do VINCENT: Come on, sing. He's half crazy all for the love of you itwon't be a stylish marriage I can't afford a carriage But you'll look sweet upon the seat Of a bicycle built for two (VINCENT HUMMING) Well, well, what have we here? Bye, Daddy. (KISSES) Spring fever or too much work on your show? No, I was just thinking. Well, why aren't you over there helping your mother get ready for Vincent's party? She doesn't need me and I'd only be in the way. I see you've been very quiet the last few days, young lady. Anything wrong? Is there anything that isn't wrong? Well now, that sounds very sad and serious. I haven't even heard you around the house for days. Guess that's because you've been too busy working with Mr. Bullit. Oh, that won't last forever, he'll be off for China soon. Then you and I will see much more of each other. You know, your old daddy loves you even when he is busy. Yes, I know you do, Daddy. Anything I can get you in town? No, nothing, thank you. I suppose you're broke again. Mmm-hmm, but that doesn't matter. (CHUCKLES) Here, take this dollar, and geta little remembrance for Vincent for his birthday. Goodbye. (KISSES) ALICE: A little remembrance. Daddy? Yeah? What can I get Vincent with a dollar? Ooh, cigarettes, something like that. He won't remember me if I just give him cigarettes. (LAUGHS) Oh, he's not supposed to remember you. The idea is you're supposed to remember him on the occasion. Daddy, couldn't I have my next month's allowance? No, I advanced your next month's allowance to get your costume for the play. Well, couldn't I give you a promissory note or a pledge or a blank check or something? (LAUGHING) All right, here's another dollar. With your ideas of finance, you'll probably go to Washington as our first lady senator. Goodbye. Bye. Decidedly, Mrs. Fullerton. You don't need me to help you, do you, Mother? No, thank you, darling. I think if we put... Mother, look, can I... Not one penny. I saw you hold up your father. Now run along and play, dear. I'm busy. Do you think if we put the lantern just about two feet over that way over there? MAN: Yes, quite the improvement that way. No, I don't know, I think I like it where itis. Hello, Stevens. Good morning, Miss Alice. How are things with you? If by things, you mean the horses, I'm having loads of luck. All bad. And I can't let you have a cent. That's fate. Oh, flower girl! All you have, child. Oh! Lady Iris, I lay these flowers and my heart at your feet again. What is your answer, now that adversity has taught you wisdom? MARY: Were you to lay the world there before me, my answer would still be the same. No. My answer would still be the same. No! You cad! No, my brave! No my... No, no, no, no, no! The line is, "No my brave soldiers, let him go in peace." "No my brave soldiers, let him go in peace." All right, that was swell. Everybody relax. Come on, relax. Now rest. Rest up. Tony, don't you pay attention to me when I talk to ya? I've gotta have more feeling from you. I should give more feeling? Yes, yes. You gotta mean it. Especially when she says, "You cad!" Alice. Hey, Allie! Hello, Allie. Oh, hello, Kenneth. Oh, gee, your second-act costume. Oh, that's swell. Look, let me handle this, Allie. But, Ken, I... I'll tell Mary Lee that you played Lady Iris first, and it's your part, really... But I don't want her part, Ken. Huh? No, it's about something else. Oh, uh, excuse me. Mary Lee. I thought maybe I... If you've interrupted us to ask me to give up the part, Alice, well, the answer is no. Why, Ijust thought maybe I could sell you my costume. Oh, it's very nice! But I'm having one made by the woman who make's Katherine Cornell's. Oh. I'm sorry. Kenny, I think I've rested long enough now. And just as soon as the visitors go, I think we can go on. Uh, how's everything? Oh, perfect. It's perfect. How's everything with you? Well, just perfect. How's Mr. Bullit? Oh, he's much better, thanks. Ken, you wouldn't want to buy a bicycle, would you? Not unless it'll float. You see, I've been thinking seriously of joining the Navy. I wish there was a navy for girls to join. Huh? Goodbye, Ken. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hey, Butch, do me a favor will you? Mmm-hmm. Look, here's a dime. And you run over to Alice's house. See, ‘cause she feels kinda bad, and she thinks I'm mad at her. And you go on over to her house and tell her that I'm not really sore. I'm just a little... Well, a little hurt. Get it? All right, now go on. Huh? Oh, here, you want it? All right, now go on. I'm not mad! See something here you like? So important. Well, this one. How much is that one? Oh, well, that's quite expensive. $27. But it'll last forever. Last forever... I'll take it. Could it be engraved today? Sure, right away. And no charge. Oh, fine. Um, you do buy old gold here, don't you? Yes. Just a minute. How much for this? Well, let's see. Oh, $2.80. $2.80, huh? And this? (CHUCKLES) What's this? Oh, it's a brace I used to wear on my teeth, but I don't use it anymore. It's gold. Mmm, a dollar, two... Five dollars. And this clasp pin? And this ring? Eleven dollars altogether. Eleven dollars. And how much is this? Twenty-seven. Twenty-seven. 12,13.50, 14... 14.30, 14.35... 14.38. Um, you don't go out very much, do you? What's that? You don't get very much exercise, do you? No. But what has that to do with my selling you a cigarette lighter? Oh, a good deal. You see that bicycle out there? Very nice. Would you like to buy that tandem bicycle for $12.62? What's the matter with it? Oh, nothing. It's just that I never wanna see it again. My boys can use it, I guess. Well, that pays for the lighter, doesn't it? (LAUGHING) You're a good business woman. How do you want it engraved? Well, just say... "To Vincent. In memoriam." "To Vincent. In memoriam." BUTCH: Alice! Oh, Alice! Alice, are you home? (GASPS) Hello. I didn't hear you come in. Mr. Bullit, I have something for you. What's that? It's a present. A present? Just something for your birthday. Oh, thank you. Birthday's starting sort of early, isn't it? Oh, don't do that. Open it, I mean. Not now. No? No, well, wait until midnight. Midnight? All right, that's a promise. (PHONE RINGING) Answer the phone for me, will you? Mmm-hmm. Hello? Yes, who wants to speak to Mr. Vincent Bullit? Yes, yes. I'l wait. Oh, Cuba calling? Cuba? Give me that phone. Hello. Bullit speaking. Well, put her on. Hello, Grace? Oh, so you finally stopped doing the rumba long enough to call me up, eh? What am I supposed to do? Stand up and cheer? Who's indifferent? Certainly, there's another woman. She's right here in the room. Crazy about her. She's my guardian angel. No, won't do you any good to come flying back. It's too late, you've lost me. What am I doing tonight? (CHUCKLES) You'd be surprised. Vincent! Mr. Bullit, I... Yeah, wait a minute. What is it? Well, I... Mr. Bullit, I mean, Vincent, I... I guess I better get ready for the party. Goodbye, Vincent. Bye. Goodbye. Harriet, where's Celeste? She's... Never mind. Hello, Mother. Hello, darling. Hi, Mother. Celeste! Celeste! Yes, what is it? Uh, help me do my hair. No, no, no. First, um... Oh, I wanna look very lovely tonight, Celeste. What are you so excited about, Miss Alice? Oh, I just found something I thought I had lost. 1 did that once with my ring. Oh, with your ring! Oh, I did it with my heart! Oh, with your heart? Uh-huh. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (SURPRISED MURMURING) Gee whiz. I thought you'd never get here. Tell me, what'd she say? What's everybody doing? Oh, they're just dancing. I wanna dance, too! Now, come on. I gave you a dime. Tell me, what'd she say? Who say? Alice. Oh, nothing. Well, then she was speechless when you told her, huh? What does R-E-C-K-L-E-S-S-N-E-S-S mean? Recklessness. "His recklessness makes me afraid..." What are you reading? A book. "Today, I met a man who needs me." Where'd you get this? Read the part about him holding her in his arms and telling her to call him Vincent. That's the just perfect one. Mother, look at this dress. I ask you, just look at it. What's the matter with it, dear? Oh, I look like a bottle of milk in it. That's what's the matter. I look about 10 years old. Oh, nonsense, sweet, you look charming. Oh, but Mother, look at all these silly little ruffles. Alice, people will be arriving in a minute, run along and get ready, dear. Mother, don't you understand anything? Well, I understand you're going to wear that dress. Now, Alice, please. ALICE: All right. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Come in! Daddy, you're a smart man and you have good taste. Just look at this dress! Yeah, it's wonderful, sweetheart. Oh, but Daddy, itisn't! Very nice, indeed. Look at all the ruffles... Now you get out of here and let me get dressed. Daddy, please! This is a baby dress... Now you go and see your mother. ALICE: See Mother? ALICE: Oh, is there anyone in this world who has any taste? Mother won't you please reconsider... Here's a reward for giving me the best years of your life. Happy birthday. Thanks, Gil. My, my. Very pretty. I wonder where I'll lose this one. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I have another present for you. Oh? Give. Grace is coming in, she left Cuba at 6:00. (CLICKS TONGUE) I know. She telephoned me just before she took the plane. Splendid girl, Grace. Yeah, I imagine she would be if you ever gave her time for it. You know, you and your confounded assignments have kept us separated for years. Good evening, Mrs. Fullerton. Hello, Kenneth, I'm awfully glad to see you. Alice isn't down yet. Oh, no? Oh, Vincent, this is Kenneth. How are you, pool shark? We've met. That for me? I should say not. My mistake. I'll say it is. Oh, you naughty man. You promised to come and see my gardens and you never, never did. Oh, I'm so sorry. Well, I can't go now. Oh, no, of course you can't. But you can come and meet the president of garden society. Hello, Kenneth. KEN: Hello, Mr. Fullerton. DOROTHY: Have you seen Alice, darling? No, no. As a matter of fact, I... Oh, I think I have, Mrs. Fullerton. But I can't be too sure. Oh, good evening, Mother. What a lovely party. Alice, I want to talk to you for just one-half of one minute. Yes, Mother, what is it? Not here, dear. Upstairs. Oh, but Mother, please... No buts. Upstairs. Oh, but Mother, itis so pretty. I know it's pretty, dear, but I want to see you upstairs. But why can't we talk here? Because, darling, I have something to say to you that requires the privacy of our own room. ..I want to say to you, young lady. But Mother, you don't understand... Now you get off that dress and those awful shoes! But Mother, You don't wear them anymore. And get that rouge off your cheeks. It's horrible! It's yours, Mother. Now you put on this frock. That baby dress? But it's precious! Mother, I don't like it. Now you girls have better get ready and take care of your... (BOTH COMPLAINING) Wait, wait, wait, wait! I'm only an innocent bystander here. Now, Alice, you're going to wear this dress and there will be no more talk about it. All right. All right, I'l wear it. but I won't come down to the party, and that's final. She looked s0 sweet. Oh, Gil, she looked like... Like I don't know what. I do. You, back in the "20s. You had a dress just like that. No, stop it. I never looked as funny as that in my life. Yes, you did. Just as funny and just as young and just as sweet. And you haven't changed a bit. DOROTHY: Kenneth. Yes, Mrs. Fullerton. Are you having a good time? Well, I was sort of waiting around for Alice. But she hasn't come downstairs again. Isn't she coming? Well, I don't know. Look, Kenneth. Do you wanna be a darling and do me a favor? Sure. Go upstairs and get Alice to come down. She's in her room. Would you do that? Oh, I'm not so sure she'd come down just for me. Oh, don't be silly, Kenneth. She's do anything you asked her to. All right, I'll try. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Who is it, please? KEN: It's me, Alice. Ken. Oh. Come on in. Hello. Hello. I just wanted to bring you something. It's not my birthday. Yeah, but this belongs to you anyway. It's... Well, it's your diary. My diary? Yeah, Butch found it. You see, I guess you must have dropped it someplace. Oh. She didn't show it to anybody, did she? Oh, no. Nobody saw it. She wouldn't do that. Well, I... I know she wouldn't do it on purpose but, well, she's only a child and... Yeah, but she's a pretty smart kid and she can read, and everything. Oh, yes, she can read, can't she? Yeah. Oh, gee. Alice, I know what's in there. It's safe with me. Honest, it is. You didn't read it, did you? Oh. No. No, I... I didn't. Well, I just looked at one part in it. And then another one. You see, I didn't know what it was, and she was reading it to me. And the minute I saw what it was, I didn't read any more because... I knew you wouldn't want me to. You won't tell anybody, will you? Oh, I'd rather die first. Alice, I've been your best friend! You can trust me. I'd do anything for you, you know that. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I just didn't want you to think I was being silly. No, I don't think you're silly at all. Nobody better ever say you're silly to me. He's really awfully nice, Ken. And it wasn't his fault that he stayed on here. I made him. I... I don't know exactly why. I know how it is. No, I don't think you do, Ken. (SCOFFS) I don't think any boy could, until... Well, until he grew up, or... Or had more, well... Yeah, I guess you're right. ALICE: My dad always says that women are much more experienced than men about life. Yeah, that's what my mother says, too. (SIGHS IN RELIEF) So glad you understand, Ken. I wanted to talk to somebody about it. You see, I... I haven't told my family yet. Well, can't you talk to him about it? Oh, you never do that. You never talk to... To the one about it. Oh. Oh. I guess you don't. I guess it's right. You coming downstairs? No. No, I think I'll just stay up here sort of alone and listen to the music. You know, he said something awfully funny the other day. It really was very funny. Just shows you how dumb even a very smart man can be. He said that... That he thought you were in love with me. (STUTTERS) Jeez. He is a pretty dumb guy, isn't he? He must have been cuckoo. I think maybe he was just teasing. Yeah, yeah, I bet but that's a funny thing for him to say though, isn't it? He's probably very jealous. He doesn't realize that you and I are just good friends and that, well, we've grown up together and that we always do things together and... Yeah, look, I think I better go now because the family told me not to stay out too late and I've got Dad's car and everything... Oh. Well, thanks for bringing this back and not thinking I'm silly. Oh, no. You are really awfully sweet, Ken. Well, goodbye and remember if I'm still around you can always come and talk to me about anything. That goes for anything. Thanks. Well, goodbye. And best of luck in everything. Goodbye and give my love to your mother. Oh, I'll do that. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'd just love to see your gardens, Mrs. Bitterson. There's nothing in the world quite so exciting as a good petunia, is there? Oh, I'm so glad you like flowers. Oh. Excuse me. There's a young friend of mine I simply must see. You'll excuse me, won't you? Well, uh... Oh... Someday I'm going to get him in my garden. Hiya, Dennis. Kenneth. Oh, Kenneth. That's right. Sorry. What's on your mind, Mr. Bullit? I just want to get rid of that overgrown flower girl. Where's Alice? So that's what's on your mind? I'm sorry. I'm just leaving. I don't blame you. I'd leave too, if I could but I can't. This is my party. I don't know why parties bore me these days. Well, I guess they'll bore me, too, when I'm as old as you are. (CLEARS THROAT) I suppose by that time you plan to be sitting in front of a cozy fireplace in a wheelchair with a shawl on. I know you are big stuff, Mr. Bullit. You go to wars and you get shot and you are famous and everybody reads what you write. You're quite the guy. But what were you doing when you were 16? Sixteen? I was going to high school in little town in lowa. In the afternoons, I delivered groceries for Flash and Myers cash store. (SCOFFS) I used to go fishing a lot. A little lake, right outside of town. I played third base in the school team. (LAUGHS) We played Cedar Rapids once. I thought it was the biggest town on Earth. I used to like to read too. Jack London, Kipling, Shelley, too. That wasn't bad, kid. It was a great world without any problems. How did you happen to bring this up anyway? Because I knew you weren't always famous. That's why. We'll to tell you the truth, but don't let those other people know it, I'm not famous now. Well, you sure act like you are. Partner, I don't think you like me. A fat lot you care whether I like you or not. Oh, now, look, I like to have people think I'm all right. Okay. So, I think you're all right. Good night. (MUTTERS) Mr. Bullit, I'd like to tell you something else. You've told me plenty already. You be good to her and remember she thinks she knows a lot, but she don't know everything. She's a grand kid. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Bullit. But that's what she is. A kid. And well, I just want you to know that I'm really not sore. The best man won. You haven't been drinking, have you? Oh. It's all right. I know all about it. She... Now, wait a minute, look, let's start at the very beginning. Who is she? Well, Alice. I mean, Miss Fullerton. And what did the best man win? Well, Alice, of course. Who told you about this, son? Well, she did. We're the very best of friends. And we grew up together. Like brother and sister I guess. When did she tell you about it? Just now. But that's all right. I can keep a secret for her. How did she happen to tell you about it? Oh, gee, Mr. Bullit, I don't want to talk about it anymore. I think it's swell. And maybe someday when you and she are in China or some of those places maybe I'll be running into you then. So long! Wait a minute. You can't leave me ata time like this. I'm sorry. I've got to get home. (EXHALES) Oh. There you are. Hey, Vince. Yes, Gil? Come on in. I've finally persuaded Alice to come downstairs by telling her that you wanted to hear her sing. What in the world made you do that? Oh, come on. After all, it's your party. But Gil, I... I don't feel very well. Oh, come on. (MUSIC PLAYING) My own Let me call you my own Let me make you a part Of the song in my heart Alone I'm just living in vain Everything that I do Is depending on you Show me a sign Of your longing for me Say you are mine And forever that you will be My own Every dream that I have known Has been built of but one desire Just to call you my own Show me a sign Of your longing for me Say you are mine and forever That you will be My own Every dream I have known Has been built Of but one desire Just to call you my own That wasn't so bad, was it? Is she coming over here? Of course. Why? I'll tell you later. Mrs Bitterson, would you like to dance? Or have some punch or just talk or something? I'd love to have some punch. And then I can tell you about my rhododendron. Very nice, dear. Oh, Alice, dear, your song was $0, so wonderful. I shall never forget it. Thank you. Yes. Very nice. And now I must take this little lady up to bed. Pretty late for her to be up. Oh, can't she stay just a little longer? Oh, I don't mind, Mrs. Bitterson. Really. I rather like to be alone when the rest of the world is gay and happy. Well, goodnight, Daddy. Goodnight, dear. Oh. That reminds me I haven't given Vincent his birthday kiss. Many happy returns, Vincent. Thank you. Alice, aren't you going to kiss Vincent on his birthday? Oh. Yes. (VINCENT STUTTERS) Many happy returns, Vincent. Goodnight. Come on, darling. You know, I think kissing someone on his birthday is a very nice idea. Many happy returns of the day. I dare you. What... I never told you. I think I should tell you before I go. Oh, rats! My dear, Alice, Well, I probably... Kenny! What are you doing up? You should have been asleep hours ago. I was but I had a bad dream. I'm scared. A lion's chasing me. Come here, Butch. No lion's chasing you. But he was when I was asleep. Well, he's gone now. Don't you worry. Nothing's gonna bother you. Why are you up? Don't you feel well? I'm all right. I just couldn't sleep. You feel sad, don't you? No. I feel all right. No. You don't. You feel very sad because your heart's breaking. I think you better go to bed, Butch. Oh, no. I'm all right. The light just hurts my eyes. I'm not sleepy. Come on. Quit stalling. Butch, go to bed. All right. Good night. Good night. Don't dream any more. won't. Ken? Yeah? Alice hates you, doesn't she? Well, no. Well she doesn't love you. No, Butch She doesn't. Well, don't feel bad, because I love you. And I'll always love you. (CRYING) (VOICE SHAKING) Okay, Butch. Well, I knew that one day, sooner or later in my life, and perhaps, in this room, I'd have to talk to the young man Alice had picked out for a husband. But I didn't know it would be so soon. Or that you would be the man. Oh, cut it out, will you, Gil? I only wanted you two to know why I'm leaving tonight. Oh, but you can't leave now. I know how these things are. And that would be the worst possible thing in the world to do. Really, it would, Gil. You don't expect me to stay here, do you? But you'll have to stay, Vincent. When girls get desperate crushes like this on somebody, they're usually very unhappy for a very long time. Especially if he goes away. I know. I was. You were? Well, when did I ever go away during our courtship and make you unhappy? It wasn't you, dear. Oh. No? No. I have a picture of him here someplace. A picture? Yes. Oh. I'd like to see this rival of mine. There he is. I was 15, and it was my brother's riding master. (LAUGHS) Oh, quite a chap. You can laugh. And I can laugh now. But it was very serious then. You know what? I think I'll take this up and show it to Alice and have a talk with her. Well I think it'd be very dangerous to let her know we have any idea about it at all. Do you? Yes. Yes, but you can manage it. Now just try to get over the idea that 20 years from now, Vince will look just as funny to her as this awful man in the picture. I don't know where that picture of me is, but I know it's in here someplace. Oh, there it is. When that picture was taken, I really thought I was very grand. Mother, who is that awful looking man next to Uncle Bill? He does look pretty funny now. Pretty funny? He's awful. Once your mother thought she was in love with him. Oh, Mother, you couldn't have. Well, 1 did. But you were just a child. I was just as old as you are this minute and I thought I was old enough to be in love. Oh. I know, Mother, but when you were a girl, well, you know, things were old fashioned. Oh, no, we were very modern. You must have been very funny kids. Well, when you think of that little girl mooning around about that man, I guess it is funny. Almost as funny as if you were to say that you were in love with someone like, well, someone who's old as, well, I don't know, dear. Just someone who, 20 years from now will look as comical to you as Oswald does to me. Mother, there's something I want to talk to you about. Very soon. Yes, dear. It's about being in love. And I wanted to ask you... Oh, not tonight, darling. I'm really awfully tired. And besides, I think your father's waiting for me and I better run along and find him. But just remember this picture, won't you, dear? And now... And now, go to bed, darling. Good night, sweetie. Good night. Don't you worry, my dear. Let me handle this. I'm not gonna tell her about anybody but the person concerned, Mr. Vincent Bullit. I think I can work up avery good case against you, Vince. I wish I could think of something to help you. I don't need any help. I'm gonna make a thoroughgoing job of this and she'll never realize that I know her secret. Daddy! Why, I thought your mother was in here. Well, she was, but she left to look for you. Shouldn't you be asleep by now, young lady? Oh. I didn't feel very much like sleeping with the music and everything. Such a wonderful night. It was a rather nice party, I thought. And you sang very well. Aw! Thank you, Daddy. You know, I thought it was all rather wasted on Bullit though, didn't you? I don't think he cares very much about music. Oh, he doesn't. He's wonderful, isn't he? He's so different from everybody else. Most people pretend they like something but he doesn't. Oh, I wouldn't say that. I think he pretends about a great many things. Why, Daddy, that sounds mean. Why? I don't mean it to sound that way, but well, everybody knows Vincent Bullit. Everybody knows him, don't they? Yeah, I mean, for what he is. He's just a fellow that's here today and gone tomorrow. But the other night at dinner that's just exactly what you wanted to be. (LAUGHS) Oh, yes. But nothing means very much to him. Well, maybe something could. Maybe that's just what he's needed all his life. Something to mean something to him. No, no, no. He's much too old to change. Well, maybe now that he's getting older, maybe he'll be ready to settle down. No, no, he's too restless for that. Oh, but, Daddy, he's seen everything. He's had so many adventures. Like the story he told us the other night about the woman who was a spy. Well, that? Why, you didn't believe that was true, did you? Well, you printed it in your newspaper. You always say that The Globe prints nothing but the truth. Yes, I know. (STUTTERING) But you're a romanticist and he's just a reporter. Why, we've got hundreds of them on every newspaper. Not like him. He's different. No, he's just like all the rest. He lives a little bit too hard and drinks just a little bit too much. Maybe he needs someone to keep him from doing that. Oh, not right now. I mean, but in four or five years. What? Four or five years from now, Bullit will be almost as old as I am. But Daddy, everything will be older then. The house will be older, Mother will be older, you'll be older and I'll be older. Daddy, you know what I think? Now look here, young lady. I didn't come here to talk about Bullit at all. I came here to look for your mother. And I guess I better go and find her right away. And you stop worrying about that stiff. I've known him all my life. Have you, Daddy? Gee, but you're lucky. Hm. Well, well, good night, dear. Good night. Stevens, phone the office and tell them I won't be in today. And not to bother me unless they have to. Yes, sir. Well, I never slept a wink all night. Well, I hope you don't think I did. I tell you, I've got to get out of here. No. Then we'd have an issue to face. And I don't want any issues. Neither do I. Wouldn't it do if I had a talk with her? Told her it was all very sweet and all that and... I don't know what I would tell her. DOROTHY: Well, no matter what you told her, you wouldn't believe it. She'd just think you were being noble. Yes and don't be noble. Just be dull. That shouldn't be hard for you to do. Shh... Here she comes. Morning, Alice. Good morning, darling. Good morning, Vincent. Mr. Bullit. Morning. Daddy, why aren't you at the office? Oh, I just thought I'd take the day off and spend it with my family for a change. Look, Dorothy, I don't like to be a difficult guest, but there's one thing I cannot stand, and that's toast that's been burned until it tastes like a shingle. Oh. That's a shame. Let me go in the kitchen and have cook fix you some more right away. No, no. She should have done it right the first time. Now, Vincent, remember your blood pressure. Daddy, I don't blame him. People ought to realize that he's not well and make things the way he likes them. Who says I'm not well? Oh, you're almost well now. And you would be completely if certain people didn't make you work so hard and insist upon you putting up with things like improper food. Mother, I don't think we have much consideration for him. Now, look here, young lady. After all, your mother didn't fix that toast. Well, she should have. I would have if I'd known about it. DOROTHY: The cook did her very best, dear. But her best isn't good enough. Of course, I can go into the village to get my breakfast. If it's too much trouble. Oh. I'll go with you. I don't want any breakfast anyway. I had some orange juice upstairs. No, never mind. I'll get along with this. You just tell me how you want your luncheon and I'll stay in the kitchen all the time when the cook's fixing it. Oh. I think we can manage without that, dear. You have other things to do. The play and... Oh, I'm not in the play anymore. DOROTHY: You're not? FULLERTON: When did that happen? A few days ago. Oh. I just started to think about things and, well, I've been in the play every year for three years now. And maybe people would like to hear somebody else sing for change. And then some people don't like singing at all. Isn't that right, Vincent? (STUTTERS) I didn't hear you. I'm trying to read this paper. (LAUGHS) Vincent's more like his grouchy self this morning. A lot of great men are cranky at breakfast. DOROTHY: What are you going to do today, dear? Oh, I don't know. I guess I'll just stay around the house and read and think. And then, of course, I'l help Mr. Bullit. (CLEARS THROAT) ALICE: You know, Daddy, I think you're making a mistake in making Vincent go to China. Why? Well, a lot of important things happen in this country once in a while. Well, it isn't very patriotic to have your best man over in the foreign countries all the time. I like foreign countries. I wish I were in one right now. Ditto. Hello there! Why, it's Grace! The kid herself! Grace, honey. Oh, honey, it's good to see you. Oh, Vin, I can't believe you're here. Listen, you've got to get me out of here. No fooling. Well that'll be easy. VINCENT: Yeah. But you don't know what's going on. Grace. I never was so glad to see anyone in all my life. Oh, really, Mr. Fullerton? Dorothy, I don't think you've ever met Mrs. Bullit, have you? And my daughter, Alice. VINCENT: It certainly is good to have the old lady back again. DOROTHY: I've heard Vincent speak of you so often. I've never heard him talk about anything else. Oh, that's just his company manners. I have a little bone to pick with Mr. Bullit. Hmm? Who is the other woman this time, Vincent? Other woman? I don't know what you're talking about. You told me about her on the telephone. The one that made you feel so young and giddy that you didn't care if I ever came back? VINCENT: Oh, that one. Oh, that was Alice, wasn't it? Oh, this child. Mmm. You know, he really had me worried again for a few minutes. (LAUGHS) Yeah, she's been sort of taking care of me, looking out for things while I've been here. Well, Alice, he's one who will let you do everything in the world for him. Don't you think so? I don't know, Mrs. Bulli. You know, there are some men that are just like children. They get spoiled by women. I'm afraid Vincent's one of those. Don't you let him make you a victim. Oh. No. I only answered the phone and sharpened some pencils. It was nothing. That's the way he always starts, by getting them to sharpen pencils. And answer the telephone. My dear wife, you're painting a very black picture of me. Only telling the truth, dear. Well, I don't want Alice to think I'm as bad as you say I am. I mean, after all, even though I am married to you, I can't help it if other women break their necks falling in love with me, can 1? You cad! To say a thing like that to your wife. Oh. (SIGHS) Could a heel get a cup of coffee around here? Well, was I a good Mrs. Bullit? Marvelous. Thank you. GRACE: You should have warned me. I'd have been better. Bicycle built for two. Fool! Party. Could be rehearsing for Lady Iris. (EXHALES) That's that. What a fool I've been. Hello, Allie. Busy? Hello, Ken. No, I was just tearing up some trash. Well, I just came by to tell you I'm going away and sort of say so long. Going away. Where? Well, I got to go to New York to my dad's office first and have a talk with him. And if it's all right with him, I think I'm gonna join the Navy today. Join the Navy? Yeah. I told you about it before. Oh, but you weren't serious. What about the show? Uh, no show. Mary Lee's sick. Her mother says it's appendicitis or something, but I think it's stage fright. Anyway, no show. What do you mean, no show? Let's get the gang. Would you play Lady Iris? Well if Mary Lee doesn't want to do it, I'd love to do it, Ken. Really I would, if you'll let me. Please. Please? You're asking me please, and I've been dying for you to do it. Oh. Thanks, Ken. Well, let's go in the house and phone the gang now. Come on. In the house. No, there's visitors in there. Oh, don't bother about them. It's nobody important. Just Mr. and Mrs. Bullit. That's all. Mrs. Bullit? Yes. (SCREAMS IN JOY) KEN: Let's go. (BAND PLAYING) (ALICE SINGING OPERATICALLY) They're going nuts! Did you see the way everybody stood up with applauded, honestly, it was grand. I stood right over there and watched the whole thing. In my life I've never seen an audience so stunned, and really... And they applauded... I stood over there and watched the whole... (ALL CLAMORING) (AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING) Romance comes to everyone At that certain age You'll find life has just begun At that certain age Wouldn't life be wonderful Delightfully insane If we always could remain At that certain age At that certain age
