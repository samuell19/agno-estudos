MY NIGHTMARE LANDLORD - Hey, girl, how's it going ? - I'm stressed. I have to go look at another apartment later. It's not furnished, but at this point I'll sleep on the floor. I know I only have a couple more days until your roommate gets back. Yeah, I'm sorry. I really thought I could her to break her part of the lease with all the crazy, wild sex I've been having. I so wish you could just move in. You know, I'm sure that two weeks on my couch has been rough. I'm just glad you were there for me when Tim and I broke up. Of course. Mrs. Alves ? Thank you for being on time. And it has a full laundry area, washer and dryer. It's great. I'll take it. Okay, I just need you to fill out some paperwork... And I need your signature here. Initial here and here. - And you did bring the two checks ? - Yes. One for deposit and first month. I have them both right here. Thank you. Lydia. Tim, what are you doing here ? - Please don't do this. - Stop it. I love you. You don't belong here. You belong home with me. I'm sorry, this is not going to be a problem. I'm sorry, too. I told you this is a quiet building, and I don't need that headache. - But I signed the lease. - I did not. I was counting on this place. I don't have anywhere else to go. I'm sorry. Lydia ? Lydia. Leave me alone, Tim. I told you, it's over. Lydia, come on. Lydia, Lydia... I'll be better, I swear. - I'll quit drinking. - Tim, I've heard it. I needed this place. If you come near me again, I'm calling the police. Lydia, what ? Come on ! Oh God. Apartment's not available. Great. Here, it's clean. - I promise. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey, you want to... you want to come inside and wait it out ? Sure, thanks. Where are you living now ? Nowhere really. I was with a friend, and then I... I just need a place to live. I have a place I might be able to rent out temporarily. The last tenant left all her furniture there. I haven't had a chance to clear it out. - It's kind of a mess, but... - Anything. I will honestly take anything, even a closet. Let's go check it out first and see what you think. - Okay, yeah. - Okay ? How many tenants do you have ? We've got a few. Some of the people have been living here for 20 years. - Really ? - Yeah, don't mind the renovation. - Hey, Helen. - I think I lost my key. Honey, this isn't your apartment. Your apartment's around the corner, remember ? Of course. It's okay, come on, I'll help you out. Here, help yourself in, okay ? Come on. Thanks, Drew, I appreciate it. - How's your day so far ? - It's kind of... Sorry about that. Helen's been here for years. She's starting to... so I keep an eye out for her. This place is beautiful. There is one thing. What is that ? Tiles being jackhammered. It's coming from my apartment, directly above. Once I finish the floors, I plan on tearing the walls apart and just completely gutting the entire place. Sorry, renovations should last about three months. So for now, this place is sitting pretty empty. But if you think you can handle that... I can. I can totally handle the noise. Go ahead, go take a look around. Hey, Kaylee. I'm gonna go talk to Brad. Hey, did you get my text about my paper topic ? I did, Lydia, I just wanted to talk to you about it in person. Okay. I think it needs work. - Really ? - I just think your focus is too broad. You're only going to be able to skim the surface of the topic unless you really narrow it down. But we can talk about it later if you need. Okay, thanks, appreciate it. What did Brad want ? He hates my essay topic. More importantly, what happened with you and that apartment ? I'm moving in today. Can you believe it, Pumpkin ? What is that ? Drew ! Hi ! I was just coming to get you. - There's a... - Refrigerator leak, right ? Yeah, how'd you know ? Sorry, I meant to fix that before you moved in. Could I take a look at it ? - Yeah, thanks. - Cool, thanks. Hello. Let's see what we've got. Yeah, it's water. The filter back here can get a little clogged. I just need to clean it out. Do you actually do all the work here by yourself ? Yep, unless it's a big enough job, we'll get an extra set of hands, but... Okay... It's mostly just me. If you want it done right, you know. That should do it. I actually grew up in this building. My mom and I lived in the apartment above. She wasn't around much, so the owner took me under his wing, taught me everything he knew, and now I run the place. - Well, it's a beautiful building. - It's getting there. You should've seen it before I started. It was pretty rundown. But... she's got good bones. I started with this apartment, moved on to Helen's. Now I'm working on the common area, and I'm gonna finish off in my place. It's going to be great when it's done. So, everything okay, you're all moved in ? Yeah, I don't really have that much stuff, as you can see. Thank you for lending me the furniture. Yeah... It belonged to an old tenant of mine. She moved out, married rich, left everything behind. This guy must've been pretty amazing to just leave everything behind. People do crazy things for love, and money. By the way, I wanted to show you this. ALL LIGHTS HALLWAY LIGHTS What just happened ? Did we just get locked in ? Are you okay ? Lydia, is everything okay ? Hey, I'm sorry, I just I wanted to show you this app. It controls everything, I mean, the lights, the locks on the windows and the doors. See ? Just download the app. Password is... Smarthome control center... Yeah. Just got to download it to your phone. Thank you. Thanks. Sure you're okay ? - I'm fine. - Okay. - I'm good. Thank you. - All right. If you need anything else, let me know, all right ? Yeah. Definitely going to steal this mirror from you. Come over any time. You know I will. I just wish my parents were still here to see this: my first apartment, by myself. I know. They'd be so proud of you, though. Yeah. Who's this ? Hi, Drew, come in. Hi, I'm Kaylee, Lydia's best friend. Hi. Drew. So Drew, rumor has it you have a pretty powerful jackhammer. Kaylee... - I... - Forgive her, she's drunk. I am not. Not yet, anyway. - Wine ? - No, thanks. So Lydia, I realized that I forgot to give you the keys to your mailbox. Thanks. Yeah... All right, I'll get out of your hair. Have a good night. - Thanks. - Thank you. Lydia... How could you not tell me how cute he is ? I mean it, you need to go for it. - He's my apartment manager. - So ? So I don't want to mess things up, especially after things with Tim. I just need to be careful. Please stop beating yourself up about Tim, okay ? You didn't know he'd turn into a lying, cheating drunk. Okay, there's one more thing. - Oh gosh. - Yeah. - Indulge me. - Please, not the texting etiquette. Drew sent me this text earlier, and it is completely misspelled. Here is the link for the smart apartment app. Let me know if you need help with it. Lydia, it's called abbreviations, okay ? It's a text, he leaves out the vowels because he's typing fast. No, no, no, I mean, yes, I am a grammar stickler, I'm an English major. Yeah, and you're also crazy, okay ? Didn't Tim have, like, perfect texting etiquette ? Tim's in the past, and from now on, everything's going to be great, and you're going to marry Drew. Stop it. I do finally feel like things are looking up. Well, to new beginnings. Hello ? There you go, good kitty. You like to bite my finger, huh ? Hemingway. Nyctophobia. Drew. Is Lydia home ? - I have a little cat toy for Pumpkin. - Yeah, she's in there. I was just inside fixing something for her. But she said that she wants to take a nap, doesn't want to be disturbed. I can take that for you if you'd like. - All right. - Okay. I'll make sure she gets it. - Thanks. - Bye now. Liar. Calm down. There's nothing. Hello ? Is someone there ? Lydia, it's me. I was just fixing the light. I didn't mean to scare you. I didn't know you were home. I rang your bell, I knocked on your door, no one answered. I didn't hear you knock. I'm sorry. I didn't want you to come home to a dark apartment. It's just, it's so dark. I'm not going to hurt you. It's okay. I think you gave me a heart attack. You and me both. All right, I'm going to head out and let you get back to sleep. I don't think I'm ever going to sleep again. Yeah. I'm going to have a glass of wine. Okay. Do you want a glass ? Yeah, I could use a glass. Hey, hey buddy. Pumpkin, huh. He's never this friendly with strangers. I guess I have that effect on cats. They say our perfect companions never have fewer than four feet. Don't tell me you're a fan of Colette. What, because I work with my hands, I can't read literature ? No, I'm saying most of the guys I know, they don't read much. I mean, not unless it's for school and certainly not Colette. You mean your ex. Tim. Yeah. No, Tim didn't read for fun. It was too dark in the bars he frequented for that. Well, that's too bad. It's nice to have things in common with the people you get involved with. You can do things together, you know ? All right, I'm going to tell you a secret, but you have to promise not to laugh or tell anyone. - Promise ? - Promise. My dream is to go to Venice and sip Bellinis at Harry's Bar. - ...Harry's Bar. - You know it ? What are you saying ? That's my dream. - Really ? - Yeah. Well, to Bellinis in Italy one day. Say it. - To Bellinis in Italy one day. - One day. Oh no. - That's my fault, isn't it ? - What ? - It's nothing, really. - I got you with that nail file. Well, you got pretty good aim. No, no, let me fix it. I have something. - You don't have to. - I do, no, don't worry. All right. Okay. It's going to sting a little bit. Okay. - Did it hurt ? - No, I'm kidding, sorry. - Stop. - I had to, I had to. Okay. Next step... There, all better. Thank you. Do you want to stay for dinner ? I mean, it's the least I could do for mortally wounding you and all. - I don't really have that much. - I'd love to. But only if you let me cook. - You cook ? - I do. It helps me relax. Plus I got a whole lot of stuff upstairs that I can make. - Are you sure ? - I insist. Okay... - I'm going to go put some pants on. - Right. - I'll...I'll meet you upstairs. - Yeah. I was a problem child. - Sounds like it. - Yeah. - I wasn't. - No ? Yeah, you look like a goody-two-shoes. - Something like that. - Yeah. Did you enjoy the food ? - It was so good. - Yeah ? - Really good. - The secret's in the fresh basil. Well, I'll have to return the favor sometime. Though my cooking doesn't compare. - You're on. - At all. But, I just... I don't want you to feel pressured or anything. I know we live, like, 30 feet away from each other, and I don't want it to feel weird, you know. It doesn't. It's getting late. - Here, I'll help with these. - Thanks. - You want your wine ? - Yeah, thanks. Sorry, I guess I misread. No, I just... I just really need to take things slowly. Oh yeah, yeah, I get it. Good, because tonight was really great. Yeah, I had a lot of fun. I'll see you around. - Maybe. - Maybe ? - Okay, thank you. - No problem. - Good night. - Good night. Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello, can somebody hear me ? Lydia ? Hey, Lydia, what's wrong ? Are you okay ? Come on. Here, sit down. Breathe. Put your head in between your knees and breathe. I told you not to use that elevator. Use the freight elevator from now on, okay ? Just breathe. I'm okay. I'm fine. What happened ? I just... the elevator stopped, and then the lights went out, and I don't know what I would've done if you didn't come in. I have a pretty severe case of... nyctophobia. - Which is... - Fear of the dark. Yeah. When I was 16, my parents passed away in a car accident. I'm sorry. I went to go live with my neighbors. They had two boys that were my age. And I had this charm bracelet from my mom. One time I was playing with the boys, and they took my charm bracelet and threw it in the cellar. I don't think they knew what it meant. I went down to the cellar, trying to get it, and it was pitch black in there, just completely dark. And... All I could think about was my parents. And I just froze. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move at all. Ever since then, I've just had a really severe fear. And I know it sounds stupid, but... I'll make sure to fix that elevator so that never happens again, okay ? Thank you. Did you ever get that bracelet back ? No. Hey... I've been meaning to ask you, I got these tickets to "Sun." - It's a play based off the... - "The Sun Also Rises," yeah. Do you want to come with me tomorrow ? Yeah, yeah, I'd love that. Thanks. I kept having to lean to the left to see because he kept moving his head. I know, he's so tall. - Thanks so much for taking me. - Yeah, of course. - I had a really good time. - Yeah, well, I mean... I enjoyed seeing it with someone who appreciates Hemingway as much as I do. If only we had some Bellinis to make tonight complete. Yeah... I don't think there's anywhere around here that serves them this late. You sure ? - Watch your step. - Okay. Welcome to Italy, "Lady and the Tramp" style. - Come. - It's beautiful. - Thank you. - Yeah. Here comes the best part. To Bellinis in Italy. - To Bellinis in Italy. - Cheers. All right, so be honest with me. Is this corny ? Because I was going for romantic, and there is a fine line. - It was romantic. - Good. It was very romantic, thank you. There is one more thing. - Drew... - It's really not a big deal. It's Victorian, like the one you said your mom gave you. It's beautiful. Here. Let's put it on. Also, I got you this special charm. Let's put it on. You press these two buttons together... And you never have to be alone in the dark again. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. Do you want to go downstairs ? Yeah. No, wait. Right. Right, you want to take it slow. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Don't be sorry. You're worth waiting for. I had a really good time tonight. Me, too. I'll see you soon. I love this. I love you. Hey, Lydia, it's Drew. I sent you a text. I'm cooking dinner, would love it if you could join me tonight. Let me know. Sorry, have to work. Have a good one. Hi. Thank you. - This is due back in two weeks. - Thanks. - Hi, I think I'm lost. - Drew. Yes, I know exactly the book that you're looking for. It's on the second floor. Follow me. Where are you going ? There's so many books everywhere. It's a very... - Here. - Wait. Right here. Not so loud. So are we gonna make out here or what ? No, Drew, I could get fired. Okay, so ? - Drew. - What ? My boss is really strict. Hey, how'd you know where I worked, anyway ? I've been stalking you, Lydia. - What ? - On Facebook, how else ? Look, I just wanted to surprise you. I know you didn't get to have dinner tonight, so I... made you this. That's sweet, but food's not allowed in the library. Yeah, this food's garbage anyways. Lydia, there's a line waiting up front. I have to go. - Bye. - Thank you. - Okay. - Yeah. Thanks. - Don't ask. - He still didn't like it ? No, he won't approve any of my topics. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can't fail this class. Okay, this is what we're going to do. We're going to go get some coffee, and we'll sit there until we think of something that's gonna blow him away. Guess I better text Drew and tell him I can't make this movie. Well, I'm sure you'll make it up to him. You're my best friend, and I need you to stay in school with me. Who else am I going to cheat off of ? Studying with Kaylee. Okay, here's a triple shot for you and none for me because I am done with coffee for tonight. Don't look now. Hey. Hey, can I talk to you for a moment ? I was just going to get going anyway. I'll see you tomorrow. So I wanted to explain something to you. You're in the running to be Professor Moodley's intern next year. I am ? Yeah, that's why this paper's so important. I had no idea. Look... You're going to really need to stand out, find a topic that speaks to you. I will. Thank you, Brad. Yeah. - Okay, so I'm going to go. - Hey, do you want to sit for a bit ? I feel like I owe you a million thank you's for reading and re-reading and re-re-reading my paper. - So thank you. - You're welcome. You're doing good. - Good luck. - Thanks. - All right, I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. Drew, what are you doing here ? I thought you were studying with Kaylee. Lydia, I saw you with that other guy. - Were you following me ? - No, I was going to grab coffee. And then there you were, you were flirting. His hands were all over you. Drew, that was my TA, and that was a perfectly innocent conversation, not that it's any of your business. Excuse me ? Okay. I feel like we've been moving way too fast, and I really just need to focus on work and school, and I think we should just be friends. Okay ? Yeah. Hello ? What ? No, that can't be right. Oh my God. My clock stopped. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Helen, do you know if Priority Mail came today ? - This is super-important. - I think so. Hey, Helen, did your power go out last night ? Miss Shaw. I'm sorry, my alarm clock didn't go off. Lydia, you're a very good librarian, and I would hate to lose you, but you have got to learn to be on time. I know, I know, it was an honest mistake, and it will not happen again, I promise. I'll give you one more chance, but that's it. Don't make me regret it. Thank you. Do you mind if I run to drop this in the mail first ? Miss Shaw, you are already late, now get to work. Drew ? Hey, hi. Look, I'm not here to bug you or anything. I just checked out some of these books a few nights ago, and I needed to return them. I really didn't know you were working today. Hey, I'm really sorry about being a jerk. I never realized how jealous I could be. That's okay. We're all good. - We are ? - Yeah. Good. Well, I actually got to get going anyways. Helen asked me to mail her rent check to the landlord. She insists I send it certified, so... Wait, you're going to the post office ? Yeah. Do you think you could mail something for me, certified ? Sure. Thank you. - This. - Cool. Thanks again. Hey. We are good, right ? Absolutely, we're good friends. Okay, yeah, Brad, I'm downloading it now. The ongoing progression of PTSD. While the freeze response may be adaptive as a child, as an adult, the inability to discharge the energy from the original event may lead to panic, compulsive behaviors and phobias. This is amazing, Brad. This is exactly what I was looking for. Yeah, for sure. I'll meet you at the coffee house. I've got to take a quick shower first, but I'll be there in a bit. Okay, perfect, I'll see you soon, bye. "Hey Brad, I've decided against meeting you 2nite or ever." Bye, Brad. "If you contact me again, I'll file sexual harassment charges." Oh, my God ! Pumpkin... All right, I'll see you later, okay ? Hey ! How's that paper coming ? Did Brad help you last night ? No, he stood me up. - Wait, really ? - Yeah. So, about last night. Lydia, I'm no longer the TA for your section. From now on, it's best if you contact Professor Moodley's other assistants. - But I mean, we've been working... - Excuse me. - What happened ? - I don't know. Excuse me, Miss Shaw, just what do you think you're doing ? - I'm just categorizing... - You're over an hour late. What ? No, my shift didn't start today until 8 p.m. Miss Shaw, I sent you a text last night with the schedule change, and I know you opened it. Oh my God. My phone, it's been broken, and I haven't been getting any text messages. I'm sorry, Miss Shaw. You begged me to give you a second chance, and I did, but there are no third chances. Lucia, I... I need this job. I can't believe she fired me. Look at it this way. At least you have an extra week to finish your paper, and if you got the internship, we could go to Italy. You'd love that. Italy. I just hope my paper's good enough to impress Professor Moodley. Yeah, I'm sure it will. - Did you want one ? - Oh no, I'm good. I'm going to take a sleeping pill tonight and pass out. Well, I'm going to finish cleaning up. - Okay, good night. - Good night. Credit Card Information We are going to be going over the ideas and opinions of Charles Dickens. This is a very, very important text. It's a secondary text, but... What happened ? I turned in my paper late. My alarm clock went out again. Listen, we're finally done, okay ? We're going to go out tonight and celebrate. Let's go see that band at the coffee shop. Okay, only if it's on me. One, two three. Thanks. Hey, I wanted to make a toast, to you. Thank you for being the best friend I could ask for. Cheers. Excuse me, your card was declined. - Really ? - Do you have another one ? It's fine, I got it. I'll pay you back. What is it ? Lydia, what is it ? It says I have $23 in my bank account. You think you were hacked ? I've used this card in, like, three places. How could this happen ? I show here a $2,000 charge to a Cabrillo Tours. That's crazy. I didn't do that. When did this happen ? Let's see... on Thursday the 11th at 2 a.m. Lydia, Thursday was the day before our tests were due. Yeah ? You were talking about a tour to Italy. You didn't actually book it, did you ? You were kidding. No, I didn't book it. I mean, I took a sleeping pill. - Maybe I forgot. - And booked a tour to Italy ? No. I understand that the tickets are non-refundable. I'm telling you that I didn't purchase them. It was fraud. Everything all right, dear ? No, not really. Well, at least you have Drew coming over at all hours to make repairs. Helen, what do you mean ? Has Drew been going into my apartment ? Yes, dear, all the time. Helen... Was he there last Thursday night ? Yes, I do believe I saw him leaving last Thursday. I remember because the thunder woke me up. Well, bye, dear. Lydia, sorry, just reorganizing all this holiday stuff. You've been coming into my apartment. What ? What are you talking about ? You mean like to fix things when you first moved in ? No, on Thursday and other days, too. - Helen saw you. - Really ? Come on, Lydia, Helen isn't exactly the most reliable of witnesses now, is she ? I mean, half the time she doesn't know what year it is. Well, she knew today. She even remembered my cat's name. Come with me. Hi, Helen, could you tell us what day it is today ? It's Valentine's Day, February 14th. That's right, Helen, happy Valentine's Day. Thank you. See ? Lydia ? I need to talk to you. Are you there ? I just remembered something about Drew. Lydia, dear ? Oh dear. Pumpkin, is anything wrong, dear ? Pumpkin ? Pumpkin ? Drew. I'll just... I'll just leave. I can't let you go. Sorry. Oh, God. The bank won't do more to get my money back. I don't think that guy believed me at all. And now I can't even pay Drew the little amount of rent that he's charging me. Listen. Listen, we're going to get you a new job, and we're going to get you a new place to stay. It's going to be okay. Miss Shaw, I'd like to see you in my office after class, if you please. - Sure. - Thank you. The internship. I bet you got it. Really ? Yeah, what else would it be ? Please. You've always been one of my best students, probably the best, and so naturally I was considering you for one of the paid internships next semester, Which is why I got quite a surprise when I read your paper. How on Earth you thought you'd get away with turning in an already published paper, I simply do not know. What ? Surely you understand that we run every paper turned in through plagiarism software. Plagiarism ? Miss Shaw, this is your paper, is it not ? Yes, but I didn't plagiarize, unless you're saying that I failed to put noted quotations... What I'm saying is that you put your cover sheet on an already published paper and turned it in as if it were your own work. But I didn't. That'll be determined by the student hearing. Professor, this is a mistake. There are no mistakes in life, Miss Shaw, just lessons to be learned. You may go. Hey, Kaylee. - Hi. - Hey. So am I talking to Professor Moodley's new intern ? - No, he accused me of plagiarism. - What ? And... Hang on a sec. Yes, this is she. How can I be late on a payment for next semester ? I don't make payments. I have financial aid. Yes, I mailed the form in on time. Well, I don't know, maybe it got lost in the mail. Can you just put your superior on the phone please, so I can talk it through with them ? Okay, well, why don't you guys figure it out and call me back ? What happened ? They're saying I didn't mail in my financial aid forms. - What ? - Which obviously I did... - Thanks... - Because Drew mailed them in for me. - Drew mailed it for you ? - Yeah. What if he didn't ? Lydia, what if he's screwing you over on purpose ? I mean, if he could do this, he could be doing everything: switching the essays, emptying your account. No, why would he ? - Tim ! - I'm sorry. - Tim, what are you doing here ? - Sorry. I... I came by to see you earlier, and the front door was open, so I came in to wait. Lydia. Why was my front door open ? - I don't... I don't know. - Just hold on. Helen ? Helen, are you in there ? Did you use my bathtub ? What ? No. Why would I use your bathtub ? Lydia... Hey... I came by just because I wanted... Can you take a seat actually ? Please ? Please. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry... for everything. I quit drinking, and I'm trying to get my act together, and... Well, I just wanted to apologize for all the crap that I put you through. Look, I mean, I realize we're done. I'm just making amends. That's good, Tim. I hope you mean it, for your sake. This is not a good time for me. You know, I asked you for space, and I hope that you'll respect that. Yeah, I understand. That's part of the process, I guess. I'll see you around. Why'd you ask me about the bathtub ? Because there are footprints in my bathroom, and they're not mine. I think my apartment manager, Drew... Are you serious ? Lyd, you've got to get out of here. I know. I'm going to go to Kaylee's tonight when she gets done with work. And... I'll stay here, and I'll help you get your things together. No, Tim, you don't have to do that. Yes, I do. I'm not going to leave you here with some sort of creep. Yeah. Yeah, no... Yeah, I'll be right there. Sorry, that's my sponsor. I've got to go. but I'll be back, and I'll bring dinner. Seriously, Lyd, let... Let me do this. Okay. Aren't you the apartment manager ? I know what you've been up to. What are you, some kind of perv ? If Lydia tells me that there's any more problems... You're dead. - Hey. - Hey. You'll never guess who just came by. Tim. No, he's actually doing a lot better. He insisted on coming over tonight and bringing me dinner. Well, I'm glad someone's there with you until I get off work. Me, too. I'm glad I don't have to stay here another night. I'm heading up now to tell Drew I'm moving out. - Okay, bye. - Kaylee, come on. Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming. - Lydia, hey, sorry... - I just... The new tenants are here. I'll be right back, okay ? Pumpkin ? Pumpkin ? Pumpkin. Pumpkin. "There's Nothing to Writing" and other quotes from Hemingway Oh my God. - Lydia. - Stay away from me. You're sick. Everything you said you are is a lie. Why would you do that ? Because I love you. I want to make you happy. I want to give you everything you ever wanted, and I will do anything to make that happen. Not like that. Finally, you're awake. Sorry, you must have hit your head pretty hard, huh ? Lydia, let's not make this any harder than it has to be. I know you're leaving. I just thought that maybe we could have a dinner before you go, a goodbye meal. Is that okay ? Lydia ? I can't hear you. Come on ! Say it like you mean it, okay ? It's a good idea. What ? - It's a good idea. - Good, good. Then it's time for a toast. You know, Lydia, sometimes people come into our lives, and it's like they were always meant to be there, like you dreamed them before they existed, like you summoned them. It can be hard to let people like that go. Anyways, it'll break my heart to do it, but if you don't want to stay with me, I'll just have to let you go. So Lydia... Do you want to stay, or go ? I see. You want to go. Well, then... There's a leak in 104. Damn it, there's always something wrong with this building. Well, then... To our fond farewell. Come on. Kaylee, still with Tim, will be here for a while. Call you late. - Girl, you out ? - Kaylee. Help ! Somebody help ! Help me ! Help ! Tim ? Tim... Drew, it's leaking again. - Coming. - God damn it. - 911, what's your emergency ? - Hello ! - Ma'am... - Can you hear me ? - Yes, I can hear you. - Hi, I need your help. I'm at 112 Wardlowe Street, please hurry. - Ma'am. - Please hurry. Ma'am, what is your emergency ? The app to open the door. Download. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Password, come on, Lydia, think. Lydia. You're just like all the others ! You used me ! And then you leave ! I was gonna let you go, I really was, but... I can't. You weren't going to suffer. I guess this is goodbye. You know what the sad part is ? No one is going to miss you. I really liked you. Here comes the dark. How can I help you, officer ? - What did you do with Lydia ? - What do you mean ? We got a 911 phone call from this apartment building. I'm going to have to check the premises. Come on in. Don't mind the renovation. That's the bathroom. Lydia ? Lydia ? Well, it looks like no one's here. - Sorry for the trouble, sir. - No trouble. You barely even checked the place. Obviously it was a mistake. Thank you, officer, I'll walk you out. She's in here, she's in here. She's here. It's okay. You're safe. I'm sorry. - Hey, have you heard ? - Not yet. I'm sure you'll get it, and then we can celebrate in our new place. I was on Pinterest, and I think a pink kitchen would be so cute. No pink. Lydia. Congrats, you got it. Seriously ? Your essay was powerful. You deserve it. Thank you. Okay, how about a pineapple theme ? - No. - Okay. We're going to have to reformulate those thoughts. Okay. Let's go. MY NIGHTMARE LANDLORD
