- Still that blues? - Always. Lina was singing it the night I met you in New Orleans. - Don't you remember? - Yes. After that, we've always been together. Today is a happy day. The last journey. And with enough money to forget the past, ... and start living again. And without constantly risking your life. I'll play my trumpet again and it'll be famous all over the world. More than once I'll play the blues remembering our deep friendship. You're right, life begins today. There's a beautiful and peaceful future waiting for Lina, you and I. - Freight inspection. - Of course. Open the back. Fruit, just fruit. Well. Vogel has betrayed us, run away, Castro! Halt! Take him to the headquarters! Death whistles the blues. New Orleans (Ten years later) Ask for a drink or get out. Come on, come on! Out. Come on, boys! This is a nice place. - Hi. - I don't know who she is. - Do you know the roof blues? - It's been a long time since then. G minor. Slow in G minor. Hello, welcome everybody. Good morning to everyone. - Why don't you come down to kiss me? - There's a good reason. - What's that? - I don't wanna. We'll play cards later, now I'm gonna swim. - Hi, honey. - Hi. - How was that trip? - Fine. - I've missed you a lot? - You mean that? - I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow. - There was a good wind. Tell me, how was it in New Orleans? As always, but something I didn't expect took place. I saw Julius Smith, the musician. Smith? - Are you sure? - Yeah, I saw Julius Smith. - Where? - At a Jazz Club. When he saw me, he played the roof blues. - Did you talk with him? - Just a few words. He was released from prison two years ago. Did he ask for me? We didn't talk about you. He doesn't know we're married. That was all? Yeah. Seeing him brought back some memories. - Very emotional? - Pretty emotional. Until my husband's death I had a happy but complicated life, you know Smith was a close friend of his. Seeing him reminded me of a lot of things. Nevertheless, I'm happy you came back home sooner than I expected. I don't know how to be without you. It's all over now. Let's go with the others. - See you tomorrow. - Bye, pal. Those headlights! In the face. - How is he? - Very bad. - Did you note down everything? - Yes, sir. If you want to interrogate him, do it now, he's got no time left. Commissary Fenton, of the Criminal Squad. Talk, talk. The boxes were filled with weapons. Vogel betrayed us. Castro, weapons as always. It was him. The letter... ... in my pocket. In Jamaica, Castro and I with Vogel. But it's impossible. Lina, where are you? You must know it. He's alive, Vogel, Paul Vogel. Well, what would you have proposed to me... ... if that information would have been different? To use Moira Santos. - I don't remember her. - You put her in jail, for six months. Oh, yes, I remember now, Moira Santos. She's in Kingston. She works in a cabaret. - On another occasion... - I know. Find out everything you can about Julius Smith's past. Ask his jazz partners... ... and also the crew of the club. Make contact with Moira Santos, let's see if she can inform us... ... about the existence of that Castro and Paul Vogel in Kingston. But... but he's dead. A dead hero is more interesting than one hundred mediocrities alive Moreover... I have a hunch. Hello? Yes. Three aces for you. Wait a moment. I'll take the inside telephone. One poker for you. And a Royal Flush for you. She's been here for more than a month. She's a good girl and sings fine. Suddenly, last night... Well, she was with a customer at the bar and later on... ... she came to talk to me. Now, look. She told me she had two old friends that might be around here. One called Castro and one called... ... Vogel. - Three cards. - Check. No, I told her I didn't know them. - You owe me forty, don't you? - Forty five. Oh, yes? Pay me or I'll kill you, don't you know? - It's just one lunch. - Anything wrong? What can be wrong? Tonight we'll go to the Stardust, how about it? I flatly refuse to go to the Stardust tonight. - And me. - Me too. What about you, Bandy? I refuse everything. Lovely. She's very nice, don't you think? Do you like that girl? She'll be very amusing. Invite her to have a drink, Carlo. And your friends, why didn't they come with you tonight? They prefer to go for a swim in the moonlight. How I envy them! They can do whatever they choose to do. Why does he invite me? Millionaires are that way. He said: "If that lady wants to please us..." - Well, that's what everybody says. - No, he's different, you'll see. Are you Mr. Radeck? Pleased to meet you. - This is my wife. - It's a pleasure. Would you mind having a drink with us? - Alright. - Sit down, please. Tell me, Mr. Radeck. Whisky? Champagne? Cognac? No, please, at this hour I always drink peppermint. It cheers me up. Peppermint. I didn't know you were performing here, if I had known it before... Hey, Lina? - You're a great artist. - You don't believe that. You're very kind, but it's not true. I'm just average. You're in front of one of the most important men in the world. A self-made man, with his strength and his tenacity, ... he has made one of the biggest fortunes of our time. Friend of half of mankind. Maybe he knows those people you're looking for. - Would you mind? - Excuse me. I'm looking for two friends of mine, maybe you know them. - Maybe. - Their names are Vogel and Castro. Do you know them? Vogel, Vogel? No. It's possible I know that Castro. - His first name is Federico? - Yes, is he here? No, that's impossible. When did you last see him? I don't know, perhaps one year ago. In Torremolinos, Spain. He can't be the same man, the one I know died a long time ago. You would have been five or six years old then. Well, maybe he's his son. No, he had no sons. What are you looking for? Nothing at all, and you? It could be you. I would like to talk to you, to see each other. Tell me, don't you go too fast? Anyway, I could disappoint you. Without the wig I'm awful. Don't misjudge me, it's not what you're thinking. Oh, isn't it? If you don't mind, we'll continue this conversation at another time. Come to my house tomorrow for a swim and drink an aperitif. - She's completely stupid. - She's bad-mannered and tasteless. - But she's not stupid. - What's she up to? She's been told to ask for me and Castro. But she doesn't know anything else. What are you writing? My memoirs. - Four. - One ace. - For me. - You clown. - Who would've entrusted her with that task? - We'll find out right away. Sorry, sir, a telephone call from New Orleans. Come. Hello? Oh, how are you, Hightower? I've got the girl's personal details. She's been an informer a couple of times. No, she's not dangerous, well, not until now. About the other one, that Smith, the jazz musician, he was run over a couple of days ago. It seems that before dying he mentioned certain names... ... and related them to Kingston. I guess the girl has been sent by the police. I understand. Warm regards. What a bunch of idiots! Smith talked before dying. They're groping in the dark, but we must take care of that girl. Won't catch me! Won't you go for a swim? One has already fallen down. - Don't you want to go for a swim either? - I'm no good at swimming. That's a good reason, so you can learn. - You're very pretty. - I know. How many years have you been working in cabaret? More than two years. - Do you like your work? - I make a living. Why do you waste your time in such an absurd life? I'm well paid. Besides, do you know something better? Much better. Listen, I like being brief. I'm neither young nor handsome. And I've got no time to flirt with you. But I'm interested in you. Is that a declaration? No, but you work for this and that boss. Forget about everything and tell me how much you want to earn per month. I don't know if I've understood you. Are you asking for my price? In a week I'll be making a long trip. You'll come with me. I assure you won't regret it. What will be my job? Just to accompany me. You amuse me. Of course. The millionaire wants a little female puppet. - But, why do you get angry? - 'Cos it's true. That's no way to talk even to the most stupid girl. Do you wanna make me laugh from 3 to 9? You sure are a very good business man, but about women you know nothing. Dear... ... inspector Marco. A rich man, someone called Radeck, ... has tried to buy me. Just like if I were a hen... ... or cooked ham. And what I think is... ... that man wants me to stop investigating. But I have refused. Who on earth does he think he is? Yours truly, Moira. Well, come with me. No, no, no. I'll do it. Good night, madam. Good night, sir. - Here. - Thanks. What do you want? What's the matter with you? Nothing at all. Since I came back, you've been acting like a fool. And you? You spy on me and you pursue me. Are you jealous? It isn't that. I know there's nothing, ... but I do care about what other people might think. You're dumb. And maybe me too. I don't know why, but these days I've been thinking of the way things were when we got married. Me too. I like to remember those days. We were happy, we understood each other. Everything ended little by little. Now this is what we got. A man and a woman living together, hopelessly enduring each other. We're married. We've got documents to prove it. But we ain't got nothing more. No! No, no, no. Let's go home. Let me drive. Lina! - What do you want? - Oh, nothing. Good night. My dear friend Vogel, alias Radeck, In 1944 I was your right arm smuggling adulterated penicillin, you know where. In 1946-47 we supplied the equatorianes revolutionaries with arms. Do you already know who I am? I have too much proof against you. That's why you tried to kill me. But I'm alive and I still have too much proof against you. This Tuesday's carnival I'll be waiting for you in number five casino's private room. Come alone. Federico de Castro. For Lina, my wife, my girlfriend, my best friend. Federico. What do you want? What's the matter with you? Federico de Castro. Your first husband is alive. Sir, will you buy this little watch? - What are you gonna drink? - An absinthe. Excuse me? Please. Thank you. You're gonna spill my drink! What do you want? To look. Only friends can look. Get out of here! Don't you hear? This is something of our own. It seemed to me it was a public bar. I like the show. Do what I tell you. Pay or go away. - Have I broken anything? - They'll break some bones of yours. How much do they pay you for the publicity? Sorry man, you're losing. What about you? My brother means your arm. He always talks about arms. Oh, I'm fine. - Wanna try? - If he isn't tired... Don't drink it, Goliath. Go! What a weakling! He started before the sign. Well done. Wanna try with me? If you're not too tired. Would you mind with the left? Come on. Go! What a couple of weaklings! - Drink a little. - I do not drink. - Drink, man! - I only drink milk. - Half a crown for the new one. - OK, Zack. Drink to my health! Very good, brother. What an arm! It's too soft. How disgusting! What an arm, brother, what an arm! Look at him, he's getting thinner and thinner. You should've seen him before. - What does he drink? - Absinthe. A bottle! You're all invited. Joe and Jim, and you? Joao. Brought up in New Orleans. Forever. My name is Pulgarcito. To Joao's health! Stop, stop, stop! We've already arrived. I'm gonna tune the guitar. Goodbye. Anything you want, you know where we are. Thank you, let's have a drink tomorrow night. Yeah. Do you know a man called Radeck? - Yes, is he a friend of yours? - Oh, no, no. - Radeck. - You don't like him, do you? Nobody likes him. He owns everything around here and many more properties. I see. - Where does he live? - On the other side of the town. In a palace, Villa Sauce. - What do you want? - Maybe nothing. - See you tomorrow, pals. - Be careful, be aware of Radeck. And if you need us... I'll tell you one thing. You were tired and I started a little bit earlier. Hear that? He says he started a little bit earlier. He's a man of honour. Goodbye. - Goodbye, pal. - Goodbye. My wife is gonna beat me up. V... V... Vogel, why not? Someone has entered the house. What are you doing? Don't worry, it's nothing. I forgot to turn it off. That's all. Please, forgive me. I don't like this piece. Go to sleep, please. Good night. I'll accompany you. - Good night. - Good night. See you tomorrow. - What about them? - Impossible. All of them share the same stupidity. Were they at home? Yeah, but that's not the point, Carlo. - Lina is right. - I don't understand nothing. - So? - He was a stranger. I'm sure. And I am nearly sure of his identity. And what he was looking for. - What's his name? - Federico de Castro. He's a strong man about forty years old. - Forty three. - You know him too? I was married to him. Well, forget it. He must have just arrived. Search for him all over the island. Bring him to me. Alive. And the police? Why don't you call the police? After all, he broke in to your house. Forget about the police. Just us two. And right away, Moroni, it's very important. A small errand, five cents. And a big errand, ten cents. You're silly. - Hey, little girl. - What do you want, sir? Do you know where Jim and Joe, the dark-skinneds, live? At the end of the beach, second house to the right. Five cents. - Here. - Thank you, sir. Don't you see? Small errand, five cents. Joe! Joe! Does Joe live here? Yeah, there he is. Joe! Hey, Joe! - Hi, man. - Hi, brother. How are you? Rosita, come here. She's my wife, and he is Joao, you know. Hello, you're the strongest man in the world. - Not at all! - It's true. That's what my husband says. Sure he is. I didn't expect you so soon. - You'll have lunch with us, won't you? - Sure, that's why I came here. That's not the only reason, is it? Rosita, go inside and cook. - She's very pretty. - Yes. You did it, didn't you? Don't disappoint me. Everybody knows that a man entered Radeck's house last night... ... and danced an old blues with his wife. There was no dancing, just music. And I wasn't able to stay and listen to it. If you were there, why didn't you kill him? - There's a reason. Where's Jim? - Fishing. Today is his turn. We used to fish everyday, but it was very hard. Now we alternate it. Enter the house and not killing him? That's incredible. He took everything away from us. Moreover, he never shows. We can't sell our fish. A week ago, he gave us an ultimatum. We work for him or we'll starve. - What are you gonna do? - Starve. Let's hide your car. If you keep on going around like a vagabond, they'll get you. You'll stay with us. They don't dare to come here. Last time they came, they left on stretchers. - But I gotta go downtown. - Well, you'll go with us. OK. Rosita, ask for a bed and put it wherever you can! He'll stay with us. Take the mattress away from grandpa. She'll do it. Moira. They've brought this envelope during the rehearsal. It's for you. - What is this? - Open it and you'll know. - Bye. - Thanks. Roof blues. Orchestra arrangement: Julius Smith. Pretend to accept the old man's proposition. Study the roof blues and if somebody asks you to sing it, sing it and find out who he is. Good luck. This car sounds worse each day. Yes, it's clear it isn't a symphony orchestra. - I told you, elegantly dressed. - This is all I can do. What have you done with the suit I gave you? I gave it away to a poor man. Well, as I was telling you, this guy told me: ..."You can't come in, you are badly dressed." Before smashing his face in I asked him: "Can we come in?" Yes, sir, it's a pleasure. Excuse me, please. You look deathly pale! Four absinthes. - Are you the owner? - How do you know that? I've been to a lot of Stardusts. - Also in South America? - Also. Here, that girl that sings, Moira. Moira Santos. - Is she good? - Not bad. - May I ask for a song? - Sure, if she knows it. The roof blues. That's an old song. I'm trying to bring it back in fashion. She's crazy about you. She sings good. You've enjoyed the blues, haven't you? Serve the gentlemen whatever they want. Good evening. - Hi, they are my friends. - Pleased to meet you. - Will you get me a drink? - Sure. Whisky. Many thanks for the song. Your welcome, it's been a pleasure to sing for you. How did you know that number was in my repertory? I had a hunch. - I haven't sung it since a long time ago. - You sung it very well. Thank you. - Have you finished? - Yes. - What are you gonna do now? - Go home, like all the good girls. I'm a stranger, why don't you show me the town? As you wish, wait for me. Here, it's horrible. Wait for me at the bar. I'll be back soon. Bye, see you later. You don't look like the Moira that was singing a few minutes ago. - Is there anything worrying you? - No. Where are we going? I don't know, just by the sea. But this is a dead end, it just goes along the beach. Do you trust me? Well... Yes, you are a strange man. What do you do for a living? Many things. How long have you been here? A short time. But you have friends already. A few. Well, you're not very talkative, are you? Not at all. - Is it black tobacco? - No, it's blonde tobacco. Well, It would be because... ... I have never smoked. - And why are you smoking now? - I don't know. I'm worried. Why? Why have you brought me here? To be alone. What's the matter with you? Why are you shouting like that? I thought you were going to kill me. Seriously, what are you looking for? Tell me. Nothing at all, you were likeable. That's all. I don't believe you. You want to know who I am. And why I've asked you to sing the roof blues. But I want you to know one thing, I'm not gonna hurt you. Take me to Kingston, please. Thanks a lot and goodbye. Will I see you again? To keep on interrogating me? You know where you can find me. Seriously, you're a very likeable man. - Good night. - See you soon. - Come on, we're closing. - Hey, boy! - Tell me, sir. - Call that number on my behalf. Tell them to go to the port. Right away, hurry up. Yes, sir, thank you very much. That Joao is a pig-headed, he could've fallen in some trap. - He's not a child. - No, but he likes girls too much. There's never too much. Keep on playing cards with Rosita, I'll go for a walk. - If you lose I'll kill you. - Whom are you gonna kill? Wait, I'll go with you. - You, sit down there. - But I don't know how to play. Neither do I, shut up and play. All in. Hey, you three are awfully ugly. Joe! Come on, there he is! - Jim! - Joao! It's Joao! Radeck's people are in the neighbourhood! Brother... Sir, commissary Foch insists on seeing you, he says it's very urgent. - My dear friend, how are you? - Good morning. - Do you wanna have breakfast? - No, thanks. What do you want? Carlo Moroni has been murdered. We've found his body near the dock. - Have you captured the murderer? - No, that's what I want to talk about. I've been informed you had a strange visit last night. - Why didn't you inform me? - Well, it was... - It was just a joke. - But this is no joke. Excuse me. Hello? Yeah, that's me. How are you, Moira? What a surprise! It'll be a pleasure. See you later. That's life. You lose a man but find a woman. You don't seem to be very much affected. I hope the consequences of this won't affect you either. Good day. This is my secret place. A sloop, a boat, and a little house. I always come here when I need to be alone. Why have you brought me here? It's about time you start knowing all my secrets. That's true. We'll leave on Wednesday, straight to La Costa Azul. La Costa Azul? No singing at all? We'll be there for three months. - Won't your wife believe that we...? - No. She knows I never cheat on her. It's marvellous. Come, I invite you to enjoy my sloop. It's like offering you a part of myself. It'll be the last trip, then, just rest. I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Vogel. My husband has told me a lot of things about you. Fruit, just fruit. I have too much proof against you. That's why you tried to kill me. But I'm alive and I still have too much proof against you. No, no, no! No! Still... Why don't you tell me what's the matter with you? I don't wanna go to that appointment, I just don't wanna go. Are you afraid? What a bunch of idiots! They couldn't get him. I don't know what your husband wants of me. He's killed Moroni. I've thought the best for me is to go away. - Where to? - I don't know, far from here. Don't you realize you will only prolong this anguish. You should face the facts. What is he intending? Money? We'll give it away. Me? Not after such a long time. Besides, I also need to meet him in order to legalize my situation. Didn't you think about that? That's not the problem. Castro wants to kill me. You're crazy. Why has he killed Moroni? Self defence, Moroni attacked him. I've already told you there are things that you don't know. You should know it someday. Today is the same as tomorrow. Know what? I was the one who informed the police about the track your husband and Smith were driving. So what? They were only transporting fruit. That's what they thought. They and you. They were also transporting guns and ammunition, and Castro knows that. He knew it then, when they searched the truck. He came back to take revenge. Why did you do it? I was mad about you. Crazy about you. And Castro and Smith knew too many things. I needed you, I wanted to marry you. You've said my husband knows everything about your past. He'll still know it, that's why he can't run away. I'll come with you to that meeting. I know what you think. I should hate you and cry. I should insult you. But it's been many years since. A long time ago. Castro is just a memory, almost an unreal memory. I was very happy with him, but now it'll be hard to love him again. You filled all of my time. You're my real life. You're my husband, the rest doesn't matter. Good night. Mr. Fellows, Mr. Fellows, I've come for your mask. - Oh, here, give my regards to Rosita. - Five cents. No way! What a ruin! Stay there! Everything is here. - How's Joao? - He's better. - Will he give me ten cents? - I don't know, I'll ask him. Why don't you give me an advance? He's sick and it won't be fine. I don't wanna. Get out! - May I look? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. It's really beautiful. Try it on. I'll have to try it on. You're crazy if you go there. You're still in bad shape. You don't know nothing. This is man's business. - Well, get out of here. - I'll find another man. OK, but first serve the dinner. Who? Which one of you is Castro? What's this? Who are you? Commissary Fenton, Criminal Squad. You know inspector Foch. Agent Alfred Pereira, Interpol. What is this masquerade? Paul Vogel or Paul Radeck, as you want. I've been ordered to arrest you for the death of Julius Smith. And for the crimes of kidnapping, homicide, smuggling of arms, ... drug smuggling, and many other crimes in the past. And Castro, where is Castro? Castro... Buried in a graveyard in South America for fifteen years. What? But the letter... This meeting... I set everything up. Smith told me in New Orleans how my husband died. He told me who was responsible for his death. I decided to destroy you. There was no proof against you. The police didn't believe me. Then this idea occurred to me. I wrote this letter imitating my husband's signature A letter that was an accusation. I sent a copy to commissary Fenton. If you come to this meeting, you'll be admitting your guilt. If anybody moves, I'll shoot. Don't try anything, Foch. Get out of my way! It's useless, you can't escape! Did you hear that? Attention please, Interpol agent Alfred Pereira speaking. This is a warning to all the patrol cars on the island. Order of arrest against Paul Radeck for murder. Shut up. I can't hear it! Paul Radeck. Red car registration number Z1259. Dead or alive. He's driving on the west road. He's being chased by the police and a group of sailors. - He's armed. - Shut up! Good heavens, If they kill him I'll die! No news about Paul Radeck yet. Police are watching over the coast with the help of a group of peasants and fishermen. The killer's car has been found abandoned in the South Coast swamps. - Have they captured him? - Not yet. That Radeck has disappeared. Police are afraid he'll leave the island. - Interpol. - Go ahead. - No news yet? - Nothing. There he is! Freeze! What are you doing here? Don't move or I'll shoot! Let me get through, please. I can't. Why? What have I done to you? Nothing to me, but you've done too much evil. You've traded with poverty and pain. That's why I can't let you escape.
