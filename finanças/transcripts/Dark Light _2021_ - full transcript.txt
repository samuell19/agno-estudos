Then nutty looking lady that was looking for her mother in Ireland. She is a real damaged set of goods. Her father is a Spanish Royal. Mother left her in Spain. Lots of incest files. Uncle was let free of high crimes. She went through therapy as a child, didn't work, then drugs, then about a hundred therapists. Then for some reason, out of the blue, she begins an obsessed search for her mother in Ireland. She was found at a party in a trance, that summer solstice. So we hired a young, brilliant Spanish doctor, speaks the language, and the doctor in the hospital in Ireland has been using state-of-the-art methods analyzing the decoding brainwaves. This doctor is one of the best in Europe. Patient, Jeanie Del Rey. She has many personalities inside of her head. Madam, I remember seeing this freaky looking woman at the summer solstice in Stonehenge. I suggest you shut your big mouth. Big sister hears all. The British military, the most powerful, most secret, and most brilliant force on nature's green earth. Tail the American! I want to know who killed these people. Madam, with all due respect, when did you actually care about a few dead Irish? One of them was a friend of mine. We met at Rudlow Manor on a project. He was a grand member of the Golden Dawn. He is, was, a great scientist. Find out who killed our constituents. Agent Pietra? This is Agent Hastings. Welcome to Ireland. Hope the ferry ride from France was not too roughly. I'm sure you will be used to the cold having stationed in New York for a few years back. They say that roughly against most of the sun in Ireland, which ain't much. Radio says it's gonna snow in Wexford today. You see clear as a fog, weather has to say its mind of its own in the Republic. I know the rental car is not up to your standards. For this case we thought low-profile might be the best solution. On your way to Wexford, make sure you stay on the left. Plenty of Yanks slam stop on the roads in the islands for not staying on the left. The Iris mostly, well, they're amiable and 30 so-so. I have your full report here. I know you suffered PTSD from the last case in LA, when you had the occult crime unit there. We know the Persidio case well. You did a hell of a job on that. Sorry about the outcome. Your apartment is on the quay. Hell of a lot better than your Rent-A-Car. They say you're the best Interpol agent for the job, especially with your occult background. There have been two murders in five weeks, similar hocus pocus signs on the crime scenes. We've got some great Spanish lady at the Wexford psyche unit saying she did the crimes. Impossible, she's been locked up for two months in the looney bin. Report from Wexford boys says there has been some, well let's say, extra natural in tendency with this nutter in the ward. From what I hear, she's a real monster. There is a brilliant Spanish doctor, Astrid Thomas. She's been analyzing the madwoman. Said she has over nine personalities and that one of those nine says she did the murders. The doctor says she is delusional. There is a special priest that has dealt with criminally insane over the 30 years. His name is Father Malichi Peterson. Supposedly he can help us with mysterious symptoms outside the normal science approved protocol. We need to know who did these murders. I expect a full report in one week. Yeah, well if I'm going to go in there, I need a drink and a good night's sleep. Agent Pietra, you were supposed to be here. Yeah, well look, Doc, I'm a little jetlagged. I'll be there tonight or first thing in the morning, all right? Thank you, sorry. Hello, sir. Good afternoon, sir, how can I help you? Yeah, I'm here to have a visitation with a doctor. Okay, no problem. I'll just give you a quick sweep if I may. What's that there, sir? Special Agent Charge Interpol America. Oh, no problem, that's fine, sir. Okay. Here to see the doctor. They've all got guns. Everyone. All these Americans have all got guns! - It's okay. - It's going crazy. Walk steady, Gill, it's only a man. It's okay now, you calm down, let's get you back in the ward then. Good man. Agent Pietra? A fellow American? It's good to meet a fellow Yank. Fellow yank, huh? What the hell are you doing in this haunted Irish nuthouse? Oliver, if you could please take the agent here to see Dr. Astrid. Yes sir. Thank you. Thank you, pal. You're welcome. Oh yeah, to answer your question. My mother was Irish and my father was American like you. My father was a big ladies man. So one day, my mother came to my room. She told me, you ain't getting up on the dole. You gotta get a job, you idiot. So I figured that there was only two places for hire, I looked up. There was a pizza joint and a nuthouse. Can you believe it? Funny enough, my specialty was studying mental cases, since my family was one. Did I mention the pay was good? My girl loves that I work here. She's a bit of a goth chick, but you know, she likes hearing my stories every night. That's a little bit too much information, all right? I thought the Irish hated Oliver Cromwell. Fake names protect us from the nuts. I'm here to study a case, a murder case. A couple of murders in town, your little hick town, all right? And I need a big file on this lady here. I know you know her. You know this lady, don't you? Yeah, I know her. Okay well, I need a lot of information on her because these psychiatrists, you know, they're all bleeding hearts. It's "My mommy did it, my daddy did", you know, all that. I'll give you 50 bucks if you give me a big file. Make it a hundred and I'll get you a full file. What kind of patriot are you? My girl, she likes nice things, you know? Yeah, been there, done that. Want to take your jacket off, sir? It's gonna be warm when they lock your room. I think I'll be just fine. I'm still cold. Gimme my ice pack. Gimme my ice pack! Gimme my ice pack! Now these three need to go into their room by six o'clock. They get very violent after that time. - Yes, ma'am. I wanna go home! Michael Collins! Nice place. You're lucky, it's concert day. That's a real nice concert. Not really, they play the same thing every Friday. What's that mean? Oh, hello. Oh, I see. What the hell? It's the same girl. No, they're twins. But they're too young to be here, what the hell did they do? Ah, they baked their mother. They baked their mother. All right, I better get to the doctor's office before I get murdered. Which way? Ah, right this way. Thanks, Logan. Oliver. Oliver Cromwell, thanks. Hey Captain, look at her teeth. Look at her teeth. Your fucking teeth. Gimme something to smoke. You remind me of my son. I'm trying to give up, will you stop asking? Well if you stop fucking grabbing the smokes. Do you wanna look like that?! Girls, settle down, please. IF you want a smoke, I'll get you one, right? - Okay. - Cool. Check him out. Already fucking looking. - I love it. - I saw him first! I'll fucking kill you. Ah, looks like it quit snowing. Hey, what kind of birdies are you? I bet you're happy it stopped snowing. Freezing your asses up here in Ireland, huh? Lovebirds. Or shall I say genus Agapornis from the Psittaculidae family from Africa. And you're from Madagascar. Must be great to have all those cousins, huh? Oh. Impressive, very smart of you. You know a lot about birds. Take a seat, please, sir. I'm not so smart, I just read a lot, thank you. Mhmm. Look, the white bird is the female. Her name is Joan of Arc. And the blue one is her man Freud. They love each other very much. Joan of Arc and Freud, huh? You know, they say that lovebirds, they mate for life. That when one dies, the other one dies. Very romantic, Agent Pietra. However, every time I leave on the weekend, Joan of Arc is pecking the hell out of Freud. He was bloody yesterday morning. Well, a woman is to be loved, not understood. Sounds familiar. Mark Twain? Oh no, my teacher will murder me. It's Ireland's greatest, Oscar Wilde. But you don't seem the Wilde type. He was a very free man and your reputation is one of extreme conservatism. Oscar Wilde died a Christian. Not that anyone in the so-called press would ever write that. But for a broken heart, how could Jesus enter? That's okay, I'll eat some garlic later. Kills vampires too. They did say you were eccentric. I'm sure you know that I deal with many more how should I say, more challenging test than your types everyday. So they said I was eccentric, huh? I guess that's a double edged sword. The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. Wilde again? I guess you're not only brilliant, you are obsessive. An easy observation. I'm sure it helps you with investigations. Like a tiger, I'm sure you don't let go. Agent Pietra, I have read your report as ordered by Interpol. And I'm not only supposed to help you with murder cases. They directed me to attempt to help you with your own demons. I don't had demons. I just got frazzled by a case a few years back. A woman like you who went to Oxford should know it's PTSD. Demons was a figure of speech, Agent Pietra. And do I detect a bit of an inferiority complex here? 'Cause mentioning Oxford is a clear indication. There's no need for envy. You are the one who was decorated by the President when you were young in Iraq. I know you chose that as a way out of a troubled youth and prison, very impressive. I'm not so impressed. I can see you're still suffering a bit. Those dark circles under the eyes, do you sleep much? And your hands are shaking. May I get you a glass of water or... No, I'm okay, I'm fine. You're a very observant woman. Does it make a difference if I am a woman? Oh, here we go again with this feminist bullshit. Now look, what is this, some kind of analyst thing? Look, I came here to help with a murder, not to be analyzed by some young- Chick? There were called bears at Oxford. At least the gentleman said it in another room. I'm sure you have at least, let me, two divorces. Three. What are you, psychic? You're the street smart one here. Self taught. May I ask what a GED is? General Education Diploma. Now look, we gotta end this session, okay? I know what you're doing, you're trying to analyze, you can't analyze a guy like me, right? Pride is a sin. Lest we forget, Agent Pietra. I'm the king of sin. There's two types of people in the world. People that set out to do evil and people that set out to do good. I belong to the latter. I came here, I wanna figure out this murder case, I wanna know what happened to this Mr. O'Leary. And what's going on with this crazy Spanish chick? No disrespect. Pretty and wacked, those are two words I can come up with. Lost and abandoned are the first two that came to mine. Figures, bleeding heart. You think she killed them? Impossible. She has been locked up here with me for weeks before the murders. You sure you didn't let her out on some hippy retreat weekend? Oh, your American humor does not agree with me. American, huh? I guess who has the inferiority complex now? Touche, Agent Pietra. Look, patient Del Rey has been very troubled. But she's not a murderer. To give you the bottom lines, I am nearly capable to merge Jeanie's personalities into one. I worked months on it with a combination of therapy medicine and state of the art scanning of brain activity, I am nearly there. Just because this is Ireland, I have to even consider this insane exorcism that Father Malichi desires to do so desperately. I think it would hurt her and cause her to split to even more mask to protect her original self. But she's such a sweet person if one gets to know her. Oh yeah, she's a real sweet kid. Look at this, she stabbed her father's hand with a screwdriver. She threw two cats in a fireplace, lucky they got out. And cut her brother's hair off when he was four years old. Yeah, she's a real winner, this one. Agent Pietra, I have studied multiple personality disorders my whole life. Well that's not very long. Long enough to have two doctorates at the capacity, don't you think? I feel things. And that woman is crazy. She's a real monster, a real bitch. I beg your pardon. What the hell is wrong with you, sir? Don't ever call her or any woman a bitch in front of me again. Do you understand that, sir? I stand corrected, I'm sorry, I was wrong. Look. I'm really sorry. Look, we didn't start things off right. You're a very brilliant young doctor and I'm an old salty dog who knows how to figure things out. Why don't we join forces, huh? Okay, your apology accepted. Agent Pietra, it will be wise for both our jobs to move alone. Jeanie has at least eight personalities. And she's not easy to be near. And I am worried about your own mental status. Interpol will approve an elephant to investigate if they could close this case. I think you should be on some beach somewhere sipping a pina colada. I know you have gone through a lot. Your work is to be commended. But this case is for those who are more- - What? More mentally capable? I spent three years in Presidio. You know what that is? It was a Satanic case. Three years of my life! I saw children! Children were murdered! You understand this? It'd shake anybody to the foundation. And there was American Army officers involved. It shook my foundation, you understand that? You were almost killed. It must have been a trying experience to say the least. But you are lucky you're alive. I do respect your gallantry, Agent Pietra. I do respect you. You have gone through a lot. But sometimes we push ourselves too much. And just because they approve you doesn't mean in my opinion that you are up to task. Look, I have studied two years just on body language. And yours are reflections of major conflict. Body language? I grew up on the streets of New York. What do you know about body language? You're just a kid! What can you tell about my body language? Your feet are pointed for the door. You want out of here as fast as you can. I told you I wanted to have a smoke. Dr. Thomas, Jeanie just stabbed another. Sandra, are you all right? I'll be fine. Jeanie needs sedating. You have to sedate her! I think I may have mentioned something about more security! And I told you, Doctor! Oliver, take care of Sandra. She shouldn't have gone. Am I too old for this? Can I leave this here, thank you. Michael, wait! Let me step through. Please, stop. I have to enter the forest! Enter the trees, I can be safe in the trees. I must go to the forest, forest. I must enter the trees. Trees can save me! Hey, Jeanie. Please. Let me get the fucking knife! I got this, okay? We won't be needing any of your American guns. Do not show them, do you hear me? Yeah, anyone could hear you. Jeanie. It's me, Dr. Thomas. It is all going to be just fine, do you hear me? No one died, no one is bad off, it is all okay. Am I speaking to Jeanie, or is it Kimber-Ann Baru? Or is it Black horse? Oh, I like you music, Jeanie. You have so much great taste in music. For this music has so much character. Thank you for playing it for us. Do you like this song, Dr. Thomas? This human, another human you bring in my domain! He's irritating me! Send him away now! Doctor! Send him away! Will you never learn? I won't cast myself near this one. He's like my father! What the hell? That's not French, is it Spanish? What's she saying? It's Spanish, she's speaking Spanish. She's speaking of her father, that he enjoyed the blood, that he liked the blood. He abused her. Sunshine, come here. Come with Dr. Thomas, okay? I love you, I'm here. We can go get some ice cream on the quay like we did last month. You told me she stayed here all the time! It was only 25 minutes. She was with me all the time, with Logan and I. Where, where did you go? I mean Oliver Cromwell and I. She went to the loo. What the hell is a loo? A nice word for toilet, sir. I thought you read a lot. They don't teach French in Rucker's Island. She was gone maybe a minute, maybe 10, you can't be serious. I'm gonna need the fucking address of that ice cream shop. Just to the right down that alley. Sir, I need to calm her down. When I get her calm, try talking the knife away from her so I can give her the shot. Yeah, I'll get the fucking knife. She tried to kiss Jeanie! Who tried to kiss Jeanie? That fucking slut you let work on the guy! She's thicker than any patient. I begged you to farm on that one. That's not Spanish. What the fuck is she saying? That's French or what, what is that? How many languages does she speak?! She speaks nine languages that I can recollect. Many Irish speaks French. This is Europe, Agent Pietra, you can't be serious. Don't tell me you believe it's another soul's voice. What kind of detective are you? Latin? When did they teach Latin in London? Or old Greek? She's read an entire speech in old Arameic. You're daft, woman. Your college didn't teach you any common sense. We've had this conversation. She's a second level college dropout. She has no understanding of Latin or Greek. And for sure no Arameic. Black horse, stop her. Please, Black horse. Black horse, help Jeanie. Jeanie. God bless the day you were born, God loves you. I've forgiven you for what you've done to me. Forgive yourself. Rebuke this demon in the name of- Boyle's mistress. She's one of my favorite, Jeanie, put the knife down. Come, give me the knife. And let's go play with Joan of Arc. Remember how she sat on your hand? Joan of Arc? Yes. Dr. Thomas, Joan of Arc loves Freud. And Freud loves her too. Yeah. And they love each other forever, you told me that. And Freud don't want to abuse her. I've seen that. Let her be, I got this. Got what, Doctor? Sandra's face already looks like a zipper. I already have orders from the warden. Put the knife down. Put the fucking knife down! Put the knife down, Jeanie. Ow, he's raping me! Get a shot! No, Logan! No, stop! - Get her out of here! How does she know my real name? I'm sorry Logan, I slipped. Good one, doctor. Ah, there we go, there's some beautiful music. From God on high. Welcome to Ireland, Agent Pietra. Yeah. Agent Pietra! Nurse Sandra said to give you these. It's cold outside. Oh no, thank you darling I'm used to the cold. Thank you, I'm not used to it. I don't know how you get used to something like this. Ah, now that's music on most high. Welcome to Ireland, Agent Pietra. Care for a smoke? A cig? A priest who smokes? You have to around here with them 'uns. Oh aren't they a sight for sore eyes? Not one of them goes to church. Oh, Jesus. There's the matron. She'll hide me if she sees me smoking. Well I guess I won't smoke so you're not tempted. Just for a little while. You know cigs are bad for health, they say. Everybody says they believe in God. But I've yet to meet anyone who's a great hurry to meet him. It's good to see you're a good Catholic, finally someone to preach to. None of them go to church. Well, it's gonna be a long day, Father, a long day. You see, I don't belong to the Catholic church anymore, I quit. I became a Russian Orthodox. You wanna know why? I see more Satanists in Rome that work there than any strip club. And the pope, he ain't no pope. He believes in abortion, he doesn't believe in anything about Vatican, the originals. What kind of pope, why even be a Catholic for him? I'm not saying there's not good people in the Catholic church, I know there is. You're darn right there's good people. Yeah, I even go to a Catholic church in an emergency 'cause I know there's good people. Did your mother drop you on your head when you were an infant? You are a strange cat. I got a priest who smokes, drinks. You probably don't even believe in demons. I didn't say I don't believe in demons. I asked do you believe in 'em. Father, let me tell you this. For 10 years, in LA, I worked for the Occult Crime Unit. I've seen everything there is. I've seen pentagrams drawn on the ground, I've seen sacrifices. Every dog, every cat, every kind of animal you've seen sacrificed. I've seen priests and evangelists, where they kill with Satanic symbols drawn all over their body. I see the woman, little bitty lady, she had the power of an ox. She threw this guy in a ditch, guys chanting with these weird forms, right? I've seen everything there is in LA. I've seen every murderer with every Satanic smile and the murderous face. You avoid the question like the plague. I was getting there. I was getting there. I got hired as a private investigator to follow this young woman. She was about 20. She went to this big mansion one night. Her father said they were getting there into witchcraft, right? So I go in there. And they start off. They're doing all these weird dances and this and that, and they started doing all these drugs. Then they started doing all these orgies. Then they started cutting their wrist and drinking from their own life force. And then my position was compromised. I had to run down the hill, I had no weapon, no contact, no nobody. And these four men dragged me into the grove and they laid me on a slab. And they carved a pentagram on my back. Jesus, Joseph and Mary! And they... When they cut me here, see, I got a scar here, they cut my throat. Well you don't have to continue this. No, no, I gotta tell somebody. It's not what they did to me. They took this little girl. This woman put this little girl on a slab and this woman, she came by the slab and she put another slab down. It was very small and they... They took this little girl. They took this dagger, came to her body! Continue, continue, God is with you. I'm here as well. Finally... This helicopter came. I saw that little boy, I saw his hair was blonde from behind but I couldn't see his face. He was running backwards to me. It was very strange, like a dream but it was real. And the witches, they ran and said "5-0, 5-0! No witnesses, no witnesses!" And then they ran. They ran to the forest. They're gonna die, these people, father, they're gonna die! Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord. Father, do you think the little girl's okay? You think she's in heaven? She's smiling, she's with the creator. And she is smiling. She's smiling. You think so, huh? I'm sorry, Father. I feel like I've been through a car wash. Only a New Yorker can compliment you with the back of his hands. Don't forget your music, please. Thank you very much, Agent. What are you doing, leaving that for the drunks? No. I need to clean up a bit for the next few days. Jeanie's exorcism starts. But I know the devil is cleverer than me and I have to put on the full armor of God. And I would suggest you do the same, Agent. You're only an observer. But he's gonna try to drag you into his dark web. Who's gonna drag me into their web? Those demons that you're on the fence about. And maybe even the devil himself. Good night, Father. Hey, kid. Hey, what are you doing out here, kid? Where's your mother? I don't have a mother. Well where's your father at? He's up the hill. Well you should get home to your father. You shouldn't be out here alone. I always do what my father says. He says be home at seven. All right, you get home. The hippocampus, what a name. Isn't it delightful when a woman wears nothing underneath? Do you like that, Sonny? Who told you my name? Who told you my first name? I wanna know who told you my first name. Knowledge is power, Agent Pietra. I know many things. I know your father enjoyed all kinds of films. He tried to kill you when you were a child. It must have hurt. Heroin was his lover. And your mom, she enjoy her whiskey. Do you remember the smell of her breath? Irish and Italian, such a bad, bad temper. You can't control yourself, Sonny. You can't control your urges either. Isn't it Oscar Wilde who said "I can resist anything but temptation." Flesh of my flesh. Bone of my bone. Lust of my lust. Stay with me, Sonny. Stay in hell. We can live here together forever. It's not that bad in hell as they say it is. Come on, Sonny. Stay with me. You're late, Logan. I should have met my friends at the river. You shouldn't have a cigarette in your mouth, Dolores. Why the hell not? That's why. You know you're the only one ever to tell me this. I'm the only one to put up with you. Can't argue with you there, you Yank. Come on, give us another wee kiss. Yeah? Agent Pietra. I'm sorry to bother you but there's a problem. Fr. Malichi. What's the problem? The medical board just demanded that we do the exorcism tomorrow or we won't be able to do it. Tomorrow it is. How you doing, Agent Pietra. I'm looking for Kennedy, Captain Kennedy. Take a left down the country road. That will lead you to the castle. All right. Shit, they made a bloody mess. Yeah, all right, let's go see. Take care. Who killed my daddy? Who killed him? - I'll call you later. Don't worry. I'll call you later. - No, who killed my daddy? Agent Pietra. Hello, boys. Agent Pietra, a job's the chase as you say New York. Science boys found nothing. Detectives found nothing, police found nothing. I found nothing. No leads, no nothing. Just this body and all these strange carvings. Strange carvings all over his body, huh? What do you say you give me the crime scene for a little bit on my own, huh? It's yours. We'll leave Ernie along with you and he can tell us if you need anything. Donuts, maybe a big jug of coffee? Agent Pietra, it's not America. There's no Spunking Donuts on every corner. And no fat lady serving black tar. If you need something from the baker I'm sure Ernie will get something there for you. Yeah, no worries, no problem. Anything the Yank, oh sorry, anything Agent Pietra needs, it's no bother, really. Agent Pietra, it looks like you wanna lay off the pastries anyway. Go fuck yourself. Look, the Chief, he doesn't mean any harm. He's just having a bit of crack. What's crack? I mean crack, not like crack cocaine like you have in America, no, no, no. Crack here in Ireland just means having a laugh. You said nothing. He said he found nothing. What is this? And what is this? You know what that is? No, they don't tell me fucking shite. They don't seem to like Interpol agents being around here either. Maybe that's why the crack. They got British agents here too. It's a spit in the face, that's fucking shite. Yeah, I'll give him a crack, all right. You know what this is? That's a mushroom, I presume. Magic mushroom. Why do they call that magic? Satanists use it in ritualistic sacrifice and the witches use it in the ritual sex magic. That sounds like a good idea. Oh it's not so funny. Look, Agent Pietra. This, this island, it's thousands of years old, okay? And all of us here, we all came from pagans before Patrick came on the scene. So a few mushrooms, a few chopped up cats doesn't scare us Irish. A few chopped up cats, huh? How about a few chopped up grannies? A few chopped up women, a few chopped up men? How about some kids? Who ah, who ah, who ah, who ah, wait. Take your meds. Have a swig of this. Now that's my fault. I'm sorry. I should have been more sensitive to your past, maybe. No, it's my fault. I should have taken my meds before I left, I'm sorry. I really am sorry. How do you know about my history? You're in Ireland, sir. We love to gossip here. What the hell else are we gonna do? So everybody here knows about what happened to you in LA. I hate LA. I'm a New Yorker, I only worked there. They measured this? It's 13 by 13. And inside, they have 666 written in blood on the wall, yeah? And a man that's got two pentagrams carved on each side of the breast? For a cheeky old guy, you're pretty smart. Answer the question. Were there two pentagrams carved on each side of the chest? No. What do you mean no? I mean, they were there, yeah but there was also the regular cross across the stomach. That's what I mean to say, it was just kind of unusual. The blood was drained from the body, right? Yes sir. You have an eternity tattoo on your neck. Oh yeah, you know young stuff, pagan stuff. But I wasn't into any of this crazy stuff, I mean come on, sir. Were there any more needles found? Yeah, yeah, I mean there's lots of paraphernalia and, this. Lidocaine. Dead on, sir. They use that to numb the victim and then they take this and they tie it around their neck. They squeeze. And then they carve up the victim in a ritualistic fashion. What ritual, sir? Well just your everyday type of satanic ritual, you know. I thought you knew about your old religion here, your old country here. I guess they wipe all the history clean here too huh like they do everywhere else. And the man, he's carved from the left ear to the right ear, right down to the neck? I guess you were there. That's real funny. You think this is actually witchcraft? I mean, I know that's what you've been brought here to find out, but Agent Pietra, Satanic panic went away in the 90s. Oh yeah? Well it's back. Is that it? We done? Where are you going? I'm late for an exorcism. That guy's crackers. First it's snowing, then it's raining, then it's just cold as fuck. Hey, you're late for work! I guess it's that time. Arianna, please take these jackets for us. It's gonna be hot there, you see? Thank you, Arianna. Make sure you don't go in that room for an hour at least. I won't be going in there, that's for sure. What is that music? Is this a concert or an exorcism? Well, you know, the only thing that the doctor and the priest agree on is the music, Mozart. I mean, classical music during an exorcism? This is crazy. Fucking nuts, ain't it? Hold her down, hold her down1 Hold her harder! You cannot contain an old soul! You didn't tie down her fucking feet? Don't curse, it'll weaken our position. Pull it up! Nurse? Nurse. - Take him to the doctors. - You don't have room for it. You motherfucker! You have no courage. You are a traitor! A traitor to your father, to your mother, to your entire city! I built the city, motherfucker! In six days, I build it better! And I created every soul in here! I command you to stop harming Jeanie. In the name of Jesus Christ our lord! What did she say, Malichi, what did she say? You know what, you took your murders here. She's speaking of war slogans and war cries and so on. Patient eschews remaining sense of excitement, certainly to move to bold personality for safety net. Agent Pietra! Agent Pietra! Sonny! She said Sonny, she knows my birth name. How the hell does she know my first name? Come on, Agent Pietra. She could have heard that on any number of occasions from one of us, or... Bullshit, that's bullshit! How the hell did she know this, Father? Get a hold of yourself, Sonny. You know the rules of the exorcism. Can I call you Sonny? She let the cat out of the bag, why not? Can you just take this as a simple, well not so simple but a case of DID? Dissociative Identity Disorder. I'm sure, you in the years of work in your field are familiar with this mental illness. I know what DID is. Yes, I've seen that and I've seen schizophrenia. And I've seen a whole lot more things. But I've never seen a woman who's not educated speak all these languages. And you think it's just a brain phenomenon? - Do you know how- - You, Doctor! You're always thinking about yourself! That ain't no DID. That is some monster mad shit. Logan, calm yourself! Do your job! This is absolutely unnecessary and only hurting her. You defy logic, all of you. Come on, exorcims in this day and age? You must just be crazy, all of you. This is legal, doctor. We have a writ from the court. And I suggest you abide by it and let us continue. Frontal cortex has shrunk. We have proof, we have the brain activity. How does a shrunken brain explain the strength of an ox? What is this? Zendiatha Taught of enchantments and the cutting of ropes! Hathathel taught men how to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates. How to make mirrors and the worshiping of ornaments and bracelets. Armed bracelets and ornaments and cutting of ropes and effigy. A math era, the beauty of April making. Verkayal, the observers of the stars. Concavel, science of the constellations. Effegial, knowledge of the clouds. Arachiel, the signs of the earth. Zvashiel, signs of the sun. Stariel, the moon. Hakiabel, signs, the signs. Tamia, astronomy. Hakastega. You should know that one, Doctor. He's been with you with all your signs and mistakes. Taught the children of men and the wicked smiting of spirits and demons. And this mighty astronomy in the womb, that it might pass away. Malichi, I've heard those chants before in LA undercover. What is she saying? Fascinating, she's naming the fallen angels and their tasks. My mother read me the bible as a kid. I never heard of any of those names. That's because the church took them out to the council of Nice a. Gabriel taught the weapons of war! I command you to let her go in the name of Jesus of Nazareth! Agent Pietra, according to DSN, she fits perfect criteria with DID. How the hell does DID cause such horrendous behavior? How does she obtain such intricate knowledge like this, intricate spiritual knowledge? Come on, Sonny. Usually it's severe childhood trauma, physical abuse, sexual abuse cause this. When the brain splits, sometimes it can cause induced genius or sometimes even savant syndrome. Savant syndrome, it's a rare condition which someone has significant mental disabilities but he demonstrates certain abilities far in the excess of the average. I know all about this. Memory, art, mathematics. Can't you see that she's a bit like you. She's troubled but very witty, shall we say? In your case, a way to survive prison 'cause you do over desire and thirst for knowledge. In Jeanie's case, language and many talents appear. And extreme neglect and molestation causes hypersexuality. Motherfucker! That ain't sexy. I can tell you Agent Pietra what happens in Jeanie's brain. That is where this mystery lies. The MRIs both functional and structural MRIs observed. Most of female DID patients have reduced the hippocampus region of the brain and the amygdala region of the brain. 31.6 reduction in the middle region of the brain and 19.2 percent reduction in the hippocampus region of the brain. The hippocampus region of the brain is associated with long term memory. I know the studies you're quoting, Doctor. There are only a sample taken from 15 patients who are already on meds from day one. And even I know as a lowly priest that certain drugs reduce th size in the amygdala and the hippocampus in the brain. There goes your study. Two stars in the chest! Agent Pietra. There is a gift for you at the castle. Look in the water. It's as if she was at the murder scene, but she's been here all day. Did you take her out for more ice cream? No, you're bordering on paranoia. Doctor, request all French be translated to English. All languages translate in English. That's an official order. Understood. She says, translation, "Priest, the house can stand divided against his turf. Get these two ugly motherfuckers in line." I kill you all, motherfucker! Leave for now, I command you leave Jeanie in the name of Jesus of Nazareth! Jeanie, calm down, please. I'm here for you. Oliver's here for you but I need you to calm down. Now I don't know if she was connected to these murders but someone around her or her family is. Father, I need you to get some information about the murders from her. I need you to ask her some questions. The priest has the power of the earth! Come away from us! Come away from this precious child in the name of the Lord. What the hell do you think that was? Is that science? Many studies. Many studies in Eastern religion, many yogis in India has shown this obvious mental state. You're crazier than she is. Don't you feel the presence of evil? Come out of here in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord. The amygdala region of the brain is associated with emotions. That explains why DID patients forget what they say, at one personality and have amnesia. Stop him! Stop him, stop him! Stop him, he's stopping a war! She was looking at you, Agent Pietra. There's something she doesn't like, something inside you. The only thing she's afraid of is my nine millimeter. And if it was just physical, I'd shoot it at her head! The spirit contact has something against you! Doctor, help me, help me! They're hurting me! Eight, eternity! Doctor, Doctor! In the name of our Lord Jesus, I curse this devil to go. Get him away! Get him away! He's a killer! He's a killer, he's a murderer, he's killing me. Here Agent Pietra, take the cross. Hold it above her, do it now! I can't do this. I wanna get out of here! You know what happened to me before? I can't take this! Come on, Agent Pietra. I've sinned more than a pack of bikers, man. I'm the wrong guy for this! We have to get rid of this devil. You have to do this, Pietra, please. It couldn't hurt. You have to do this. Her cortex is her issues. This poor woman needs rest. You know, she's not responsible for what she does anymore than a blind person for not seeing. Please, good sir, help her! Say something, say anything that you can remember from Catholic school! Say it, say it now! But I'm the lifer! This is ridiculous. I'm ending this now. Now, do it, while we have a chance! Continue, Sonny! You can do it, Sonny. This insanity ends now. Who am I fighting, you or the devil? I'm going to stop this now. Say it, say it now! Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory! Forever and ever. - Amen. - Amen. She's sleeping. Let me know if you need anything else, doctor. We're fine, thank you. Have a wee swig of this, this'll set you right. You did good, man, you did good. You drunk it all, you git! It's not everyday you do an exorcism. Luckily, there's more. Get your own. All right. She'll be all right. They're gone, they're all gone. Who's gone? You must be joking, Fr. Malichi. You know exactly what happened there. It was integration. Integration? What in the hell is integration? The coordination process of dissociative identity disorder sufferers. It was simply the breakdown of fusing processes you need to become alters in damnation, in Jeanie. Doctor, I think you need this drink more than the rest of us. After what you witnessed in there tonight, you're gonna call it some sort of fusion? I'm sorry, Agent Pietra. I hate scoffers. Good night, Doctor. And you, you saved that girl tonight through bravery. I think you may have found something in yourself as well. Good man, you. Thank you. Keep up the good fight. Good night, sir. Some cause happiness wherever they go and others, whenever they go. I think I started a mad trend. Now you're quoting Oscar Wilde. I thought you liked the Father. I think he hurt her more than help her. I'll have to spend all day with her in therapy tomorrow. She was doing so well, she's been integrating all week. Oh. I think... I'm gonna have to disagree with you on that one. Doctor. Uh huh? Can I see what's under your right sleeve? Come on, Agent Pietra. PTSD is not an excuse for sexual harassment. Nothing of the sort. I saw a tattoo underneath your right sleeve. I'd like to see it again, please. Mhmm. The eternity symbol. I've seen that before in my work. Come on, Sonny, you have been traumatized with the priest. Have you locked your rotating door tonight? You need a good night of sleep and a couple of valium. But I don't leave any stone unturned. Might have to lock you up here for a few days and get some tests on you. I mean, that is like the two degrees that I received in the college. Eternal friends, friends for life. Do you think the whole world is Satanic, Agent Pietra? I don't know, I don't know. Are you off to get drunk with the hypocrite priest? No. I'm going to the castle lake. Come on, the place one of Jeanie's outbursts mentioned? Come on, Agent Pietra. She was in a state of psychosis. She also said that you were a murderer. Come on man, get yourself together. The whole town is up in arms over this. Children afraid to walk the streets. There were no kids that were hurt in any of these murders. Good night, Doctor. Agent Hastings. I have some complicated but very relevant information for you about Agent Pietra. He is in on it. In on what, Ma'am? He murdered them all. We believe he is responsible for both murders and a lot more besides that. Listen, are we on a clear line? No, you imbecile. Am I six years old? We've been on to Agent Pietra for weeks now. We did not inform you as it was a need to know basis. That sly son of a bitch. He must have lost it tracking down all those devil worshipers. We set him up a few months ago due to the murder of three high priests from the Bohemian Grove Lodge. A witness spotted Agent Pietra at the grove. He was wearing a jogging suit and a long black wig. He followed him and tracked his footsteps. So the footprints matched. Then we had a special agent in Dublin, gave him a massage. Got a hair follicle and it matched. Agent Pietra is killing the witches. Hastings, you know if he exposes certain things about certain people, you know it won't be good for any of us. You bastard. You never entered on the ferry. You only picked up the car, came in from France to Dublin. And he's as slick as a seal's ass. Yes, good evening, Dr. Thomas. Yes, it's Agent Hastings here. Do you have a few moments? I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm so sorry. You will be avenged. You will be. I promise you, you'll be avenged. You'll be Ugh! You ignorant son of a bitch! You got her killed! We had to sacrifice someone! You killed our high priest! This is you! Tonight you're doing the walk of death. I'll kill all of you, you witches. I've killed hundreds! I'll kill you all! You killed our greatest ritual master and our high priest! Tonight, you will die a horrible death. And there's more than me. You can kill me. But many will follow me. We're all sick of your child murders! You pagans will be wiped off the face of the earth! We're on our way to see your friend Looney Bin Logan O'Bern. Just remember this once the life is ebbing out of you in this lake. You're responsible for young lover's death. Like Romeo and Juliet! Like poetry, you motherfucker! Tonight is Romeo and Juliet, you Christian puke! You're responsible for young lover's death. She's one of ours. We all love Dr. Thomas. We've all made love to Dr. Thomas. You're the only one that doesn't get that, doll face. Like Shakespeare. You motherfucker! Put him in the lake! I will call my father! What the hell? Go now, I'm recording you. If you don't leave now, I'll press send and the whole city will get this video. - Let go. He doesn't know who we are. We'll get the Chief in there, he's one of my people. Who are you? What are you doing here? Get out of here before they come back! Always worried about others, Agent Pietra. Time you worry about yourself. Look towards the most high, Pietra. Look towards the heavens. Come with me! We can take them all down, come! My father has not approved. The mystery will be revealed. Go now, Agent Pietra. They know you killed the witches. Go now and save the Adam man. Who's the Adam man? Logan. Run now! Notify the elders. Yes, Agent Pietra. I need you to get me Logan's address. No, I need it now, it's an emergency, and don't tell anyone, please. The jugs look cool. Looks like crystal, but the wine is cheap. It gets the job done though. Come on, let's dance. Logan! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! You keep moving and I will slit her throat! Who are you? Take me, just let her go. I'll give whatever you want. You know the evil ones loves the innocent. The more innocent they are, the more he enjoys their souls on the other side. Son of a bitch! You're gonna die. You're gonna die like your brother. Suffer a witch not to live! No, Logan! It's a corrupt town, they'll do you up for murder. You take her. Come on, wake up, come on. You go to the pizza joint, you go right now. I'll clean this mess up and then you can come back. Go! I'll meet you in front of the pizza joint. I'll clean this mess up then you can come back. Go! You're gonna die, just like all the innocent blood you spilled. Like my brother in California, remember that? You killed before, Agent Pietra. You're one of us now! You'll kill again! At least I got a new car out of the deal, these wack job witches. Listen, don't say anything to anybody. And remember an old Republican book I read long ago. Loose lips sink ships, you got it? Got it. And about that Wexford killer. Are you him? Because we need to know. Yeah, we deserve to know. Just tell us. Look. Whatever they say about me, remember this. Anybody I took out worked for the devil himself. They killed babies! They killed children! Every week, every high holiday, all year long! It's real! It's real, you get it? And I can't live if I know that. I don't want to live in a world like that. Somebody has to stand up. We all should stand up. Now get rid of that job, get out of the hospital, get that pizza job and don't ever go back. I'm sorry. Look, I gotta check on Malichi, make sure he's all right then I'm on the ferry. You guys be safe. You'll be all right, take care of yourself. Father Malichi. The police were here for hours. Interpol as well, one British and one American. American? They're calling in the cavalry. They want me dead. But I'm surprised you trusted me enough to come here. I'll give you sanctuary, but you need to leave the island. On a ferry, but not from Wexford, from Cork. There's the tickets. It's in my name so you'll need my passports. And here's a little bit of money. Why are you doing this for me? It's against my better judgment. But when I saw how those demons reacted to you in that exorcism, I knew. I knew who you were. You knew I was what, Father? I knew you were the anointed. Anointed? I'm not anointed, I'm cursed! You know how many people I've killed? You know how many witches I've killed? Agent Pietra, you were chosen. We're in the end times. First thing, earth is consumed by water, and then by fire. But you can't do it from here. You must take the battle to Babylon. Where's Babylon? America. Feds were here earlier. They mean to kill you, they won't let you live. You know what they did to our blessed Lord when they got their hands on him? That's what they mean for you. I think somehow they're all involved. Father, angels are real. I saw one, a little boy named Gabriel! I've never seen this picture of Jesus before. Father, I don't feel well. I don't feel well. Agent Pietra? My wrists are on fire! Stigmata. Arrest Pietra. What are you waiting for? Stay back! Stay back, don't touch the anointed. Don't touch my prophet, stay back! Stay back! You swine! You're all swine, you'll burn in bloody hell for this! Shoot him. Kill the bastard! But sir. Shoot him! The bleeding stopped. Oh my God! You are God's soldier. His hammer. I'm no soldier! I'm a murderer! For the greater good. Act of contrition, Father. Last rites, now for yourself, say it! Oh my God. I'm heartily sorry for having offended thee. I repent of all my sins because I fear the loss of heaven and dread the pains of hell. You bastards! You fucking bastards! You killed a priest! Put him in the car! Ma'am. Thank you. You know what to do if anything goes wrong. Of course ma'am, shoot to kill. Jeanie? You feel better, don't you? Doctor, at the moment I feel good. I wanna thank you, Doctor. It is such a wonderful feeling to feel. Merged together as one? Is that how you feel, honey? No. No, Doctor. I feel as if an anchor was taken from my neck. I feel light. I don't feel merged, I feel light. Tomorrow you will see, I will show you the braces scans and you will know and understand the science, okay? What is this tattoo, Doctor? It doesn't suit such an elegant lady, I don't like it. Okay, we're going to take a rest then. Tomorrow I will take you to places Oh, come on, you put your coat here. Do you feel better? I feel better. Yeah, tomorrow, I will try to get us some ice cream. 'Cause tomorrow you will be part of a really beautiful ritual too. Please, Myler, bring me the tiara. What ritual, Doctor? Hmm, you're such a blessed woman. You have been chosen from high places, honey. You are chosen. Blessed be. You are chosen to be the mother of darkness. Tomorrow in the grove, you shall be... You shall be... You just rest tonight, okay? Go back inside. Agent Pietra? Agent Pietra! - Jeanie. - Hey! Hey, Agent Pietra, what are you doing here? Wait, he's here! - He's just coming now. He's just visiting us. - He's the one who helped me, he prayed for me! Jeanie, you need to rest. We'll see you bright and early. And for Agent Pietra, as long as he submits to science. He's got to just listen to the science. This had nothing to do with science! Agent Pietra, Agent Pietra! Remember your braces scans? He got one this morning like you did and you got all better. Yeah I remember, it didn't hurt. Go take a rest, Jeanie. I don't want an ice cream! No, I want Logan! Where is Logan? - Logan got another job. - Logan! He's the only one who didn't kiss me! No, no! Agent Pietra! Agent Pietra! No! What are you doing to me? Why, God? Why is life so dark? Why? Gabriel! Agent Pietra, please listen to me. You have only one chance. It will be your only chance. Father has instructed me to unlock your door like I did Peter's in the old times. But you have one chance. You will run out and you will go to the forest. No, but we have to go to the next cell. We have to save Jeanie! We have to get her out of here! You have to help me! That is not Father's instructions. The mystery will be revealed but you will run through the door and go right and leave now. Do not stop and do not get Jeanie out, it is not the plan! I gotta save Jeanie! Sonny, don't stop! It's not part of the plan! - Jeanie! Jeanie, Jeanie! Sonny! Sonny! Run! They're gonna hurt you! Run, run! - Sonny, no! Just run! They're gonna kill you, run, run! Ma'am, Pietra's doing a run. Come help me save Jeanie, Gabriel. Come! Run to the forest now and don't look back. What, sir? Sonny, don't look back! Run, Jeanie! Clean up that slobber. I'd have shot his ass last night. Hey, you're American. You sure you wanna drive here, man? I'm cool, man, I'm cool. How long to Dublin airport? About an hour, ma'am. Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord. Watch out for the truck! Stay left! It's been a year now. It feels like a haunting wind. A haunting wind. Yes, Dolores, it feels like a haunting wind. I don't care what anyone else said about him. Hey kid, you gotta respect this place. Sorry, I was just playing. He was a good man. A bit of a temper but he had a good heart. Kid, you don't have an Irish accent. I'm not a kid, an I'm not from around these parts. Did you know Agent Pietra? He worked for my father.
