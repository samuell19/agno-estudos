This is Fu Manchu. Once again, the world is at my mercy. I have conquered not only the mysteries of the continent But now of the oceans, too. in the tropical waters of the south Atlantic, my hand stretches out to turn water into ice, And to transform safety into the deadliest peril. In a few moments, the proof of my mastery will be complete. Number three in. Number four in. Number five in. All circuits complete. There's no danger of overload. What if the staff in the powerhouse make a mistake? Generate more energy than we need? That is impossible since fang installed his safety lock. when this lever reaches the bottom of the groove, We are at safety maximum. it is necessary to take the lever and move it down into the second groove Before the auxiliary channels will feed in. Phase two coming in... Now. Aim... and steady. The signal isn't getting through. Strengthen the signal. = no! Do as I say! Strengthen it! Morel We still have the safety lock. A little more. A little more! No! We cannot! = you will do it! No, no, no! Release that lock! Release it and hold it! I won't! Lin tang, slide that lever over! Slide it over and hold it! A fraction more, we need a fraction more, and we're through! Take your places. in a few moments, the entire ship will have vanished Beneath the ocean's surface. This is the destiny of fu manchu. Lin tang, follow me. I've got a bite! I've landed a real monster this time! This isn't loch ness, petrie. Do you want a hand? No, no, no, I-I can manage. This is a trial of strength. Bah, it's only a damn tiddler! Bravo, petrie, you won! After landing that monster, you must be hungry. Let's open the picnic basket. yes, alright, I must say this and the Scottish air, Gives me an appetite. Our good landlady's a wee bit thrifty. Hello? What's this? Probably fresh salmon sandwiches. - Iceberg in the tropics? - What did you say? Listen. "Liner strikes iceberg, hundreds drown." Good god! Where? = in the Caribbean. Icebergs in the Caribbean? Paper's a week old. Ah, something always happens when you're on holiday. Nayland Smith. Petrie. - Hello! - Hello, curt. I thought you'd gone to London? Uh-huh. Hello, Kessler, what brings you here? Telegram. Looks rather urgent. Mrs. McBride asked if I'd try and find you before I caught the train. Thank you, curt, it was very kind of you to come. Ah. Fish aren't biting well today, petrie, eh? Everybody can't be an izaac walton. No, but, uh... Well, it looks as though we may be joining you on the London train. Perhaps you'd be good enough to ask Mrs. McBride to pack for us both. Pack? But we've got another week yet! Holidays are over, petrie, this is from the home secretary. We're ordered back to London at once. Stand by for an important message from fu manchu. How long have these messages been coming in, sir Robert? For the past 24 hours. At first, we didn't take them very seriously, but now... Is the wavelength being monitored? Yes, of course. This is fu manchu. in the Caribbean sea, I gave a demonstration of the new And destructive weapon I possess. the world has two weeks to decide obedience to my orders, Or... Obliteration. Communications, urgent. if disaster is to be avoided, I shall insist on complete cooperation. I shall give no further warning. but unless the heads of state of the major powers are prepared to meet my demands, in 14 days from now, I shall strike. Did you get a bearing? 1 see, Fu manchu hasn't lost his cunning. he's used at least four transmitters, Impossible to trace. He's threatened mankind with obliteration. It sounded almost... biblical. That's one book in which you won't find fu manchu's name. I was thinking of the flood. in some ways, fu manchu's new weapon Involves water and its temperature. to strike again, he'd need to put himself In a spot where he could control great quantities of water. Panama, Gibraltar, Suez, Or even Istanbul. This water spreads out. In search of the sun. I have been sent by Omar pasha to take you to him. Good, we have no time to waste. Master, I have brought the lady. Om. The persistent lady. Greetings. Sit down, please. You have received my message? What have you to sell me? Opium. I have enough opium. To control the trade of half of the world. You are starting to interest me. You are one of the few with a pass to the governor's castle. yes, the governor's castle contains the biggest reserve of opium in the east, But the castle is well guarded. How very interesting. If you agree, we will share the opium. They will give me no more opium. Explain to me your plans. you will send your men up the river bosphorus to the governor of anatolia's castle, killing sentries at the main gate, leaving the way clear for me and my men To approach unseen. I have a pass to see the governor. Open the gates! The signal. Come, it is safe for us to approach. Omar! Omar? Omar! Omar! Omar! Guards! Guards! - Lin tang. - Yes, father. Proceed, daughter. You have fought well. We are grateful to you for opening the doors to us. It was nothing. We were able to approach unseen. We are very happy to serve you. Bring them to my father. She fights like a man. She is Omar pasha's favorite. We must kill her. - You may serve us yet. - I serve only one master. We shall see. Take her away. Why do you keep her alive? She is dangerous. I have my reasons. This will make an excellent headquarters. And Omar pasha? The governor is still in residence. I shall announce that the castle was attacked by bandits. The attack failed. The bandits were liquidated. We have one week. Continue checking every hour, report to me anything unusual, anything at all. Yes, sir. - ah, petrie. - I'm an idiot, An imbecile, and an incompetent dolt. Did you come all the way to Scotland yard to tell me that? I'm terribly excited, but I just found this. It's been on my own bookshelf all these years. Look. Professor a.G. Heracles. Mm-hmm, the world's top authority. well, I dare say, petrie, but would you explain why this book of yours Has suddenly become so important? because his theory may give us the clue That we are desperately searching for. well, you see, he has a theory that when the chemical properties of ordinary water are such, then they lend themselves to transformation when, uh, Tampered with. and he goes on to say here somewhere, If I can find it... Yes, here we are. "water, if mixed with the crystallized essence, prepared by the methods, which are not as yet practicable to man, might dramatically change its temperature to a cold so intense, As to be uncontrollable.” there now, provided that you got sufficient quantity of water, the pressure will build up, which will eventually, with the crystals, Become, as he says, uncontrollable. but these crystals of which he writes, What will they be composed of? Possibly a derivative of opium. - Excuse me, sir denis. - What is it? From Istanbul, sir. Attack on the headquarters of the governor of anatolia. They were all killed. What about the Bible now, petrie? The hand of Providence. =I don't understand. Anatolia... is the largest source of supply In the world of the opium Poppy. - By heavens, I was right! - Perhaps. but first of all, I want to have a word with your professor heracles. I anticipated you'd try and get in touch with heracles' university. He's gone on a trip to the middle east and Turkey. Turkey?! The black sea! Anatolia perhaps. - Number four condenser. - Yes, master. The crystallization process is too slow. We must accelerate it. Would be rather dangerous, father. There is no time for further tests. Number three condenser is overheating. No matter. - Master, it is dangerous. - Obey. Master, number four! Continue! Father. Turn off the power! And now, professor heracles. You will come to the laboratory. No, no. I am perfectly well aware the condition of your heart, professor. however, I can keep you alive. Not forever. I'm growing weaker. In spite of your drugs, I'm going to die. There are ways of persuasion. I'm no use to you dead. Within a week, perhaps before, I shall be dead. We shall see. You are going to remain alive, professor heracles. I understand you consulted a brilliant young specialist last year. What was his hame? Dr. curt Kessler. he's in London, but he would never help you, Even to save my life. Indeed. Not even Kessler can save me. Can't you understand? My heart... ... Is dying. There are other younger hearts in the world. Stronger hearts. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, Mrs. ward. No... No, no, no, no, two pills every night for a week. Yes, yes. Goodbye, Mrs. ward, goodbye. Good afternoon, Dr. Kessler. Yes, thank you, thank you very much. You don't have any more patients, do you? No. Well, in that case, let's call it a day. I'm afraid I can't come yet, um... I'm expecting someone. - Oh, someone important? - Oh, yes. one's a doctor I know slightly from the home office, And the other's from Scotland yard. So, they've found you out at last? Yes... Right on time. Ingrid, I sent miss laurels home, would you...? Of course. Thank you, thank you very much. Dr. Kessler? Who? Oh, yes, sir Charles! No, no, no, ho, um... No, I'm afraid I can't attend the dinner tonight. An important case, yes. Yes, you'll understand. Thank you. Thank you very much. Goodbye. We introduced ourselves. Dr. Kessler, this is Dr. petrie. Sir denis nayland Smith. We're old friends. We met on holiday. We fished the same river. - For the same fish. - It's a one fish river. um... Dr. Kessler, We want some information about professor heracles. He is your patient, isn't he? yes, patient and friend, But he has a very severe cardiac condition. Has something happened to him? Do you know where he is how? He called me last week... To tell me he's going to the continent. What? Oh, yes, some days ago, I had a card... from Athens. Look, I-I've got it here somewhere, if I can just find it. Ah, yes, here it is. What the devil is he doing so far from england? He mentioned on the card that he's moving on to Istanbul. Istanbul?! What's he doing, a circular trip? Oh, Ingrid, uh... Would you please tell them that I'm busy? Yes, yes, don't worry. I'll send them away. Gentlemen, would you please come this way into the surgery. Yes, of course, old man. No need to oblige. I know nothing about heracles' experiments. But of one thing I'm sure. he would want to, to benefit mankind, Not to destroy it. Fu manchu is only interested in destruction. But what can we do to save professor heracles? I believe it's a question of saving the world, Dr. Kessler. So, we're going to Istanbul. - Istanbul? - Yes, that's right, as soon as we can. Oh, then, if I may, I will come with you. - And maybe Ingrid, too. - Good. Thank you. I wonder what's keeping Kessler. Scotland yard, please, quickly. = but what on earth... Dr. Kessler would never leave a cigarette burning On a polished wood table. Something must've happened to him. Hello, Scotland yard, operations room, quickly. Nayland Smith here. Blech! It is no good! But what about my money! Come back! Come back! Can I buy you a drink, general ahmet? Uh, no thank you, melnik. I have some news for you, general. That's your business, isn't it? a seller of information To the highest bidder. I saw something interesting in the cemetery, you know, general. Your own gravestone, perhaps? = mm=- mm. An abduction. Then report it to the proper authorities. - I'm off duty. - Two abductions. In two coffins. I know you will be able to follow without any trouble. Goodbye, melnik. Only 2,000 cash, that's... Lieutenant, sir. Go away. 1,000 - 500! - Ugh, go. Goodbye, sergeant. Ugh. The boat approaches! The boat approaches! Master! Lin tang arrives with the prisoners. Very well. Come back here! Where are you going? I must see your master. Get out of here! Bring him here. I bring you valuable information. $1,000 is all I'm asking. Start talking then, but it better be good. Lin tang was here today in Istanbul. She took two prisoners away with her. - Prisoners? - Yes, yes. 'Course I do not know who, but, uh, I know which... Which way they went. Well...? the same road Lisa took, master, to the other side, To bosphorus. To anatolia. = yes. Ahmet. Reward him. Kessler! Ingrid! Professor heracles. Where are we”? anatolia, Near the bosphorus. It's incredible. Who were those people? You were kidnapped... Dby the men of fu manchu. Fu ma... I... Can't move. I feel I'm paralyzed. You'll be alright in a few minutes. They used my... Crystals against you. But in a small dose. Professor! inspector ahmet, Your headquarters told me to expect you here. An honor, sir. But I'm afraid that I've bad news. What is the bad news, inspector? the bandits, uh, who attacked the castle were Omar pasha's men. Omar pasha? - He controls the opium trade. - Opium?! an informer called melnik, appeared this morning, killed, In the street in front of the commissary. his last visit yesterday Was to Omar pasha's coffee shop. Poor melnik. I should have listened to him. - Why? - Omar pasha has vanished. we have had a report that he has gone to anatolia to rescue the girl, Lisa, and has camped opposite the castle On the other side of the river bosphorus. Come on! All is clear, master. Now for the castle. Of fu manchu. Bring forth the two prisoners. Dr. Kessler and Dr. Ingrid koch. Yes, father, the guards are bringing them. I have brought you here to save the life of someone whose knowledge I require as a thirsty man needs water, Crystal clear water, Dr. Kessler. The name of the person to whom I refer... I1s professor... heracles. - He is dying. - Oh, professor... You will use your skill, doctor. You will make him live. I am not a miracle worker. besides, you took everything away, Except my hands. On the contrary, Dr. Kessler. You will find everything here that you require. I don't understand. What's wrong with that man? there is nothing wrong with him, doctor, He is in perfect physical condition. And unlike professor heracles, his heart is as sound as a bell. do you not agree, doctor, that professor heracles Should have that splendid heart? A heart transplant? But that man is not dead or dying. he is drugged. He will die, For the sake of science. And for your sake also. I need heracles to complete my plans. I need him alive, conscious, coherent. Therefore, you will operate. And if I refuse, hm? Then Dr. Ingrid koch will die an extremely painful death. No! The choice is yours, Dr. Kessler. in order to convince you, I shall arrange a demonstration. Dr. Kessler, down there is the great olmos dam, Holding many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water. in a few moments, Some of our men will drop a crystal into the water. I don't understand. Dr. Kessler, if you look to your left, You will see workmen repairing the dam. the workmen refused to cooperate When ordered to carry supplies up the mountain. therefore, I am displeased. as you can see, Dr. Kessler, My men are now carrying out their work to my satisfaction. at the same time, I trust They are providing you... With a convincing display of my power. You can't do it. You can't! No! No, stop! No! No! Run! Run for your life! Complete annihilation. Even nayland Smith cannot touch you now, father. I wish that he would try. This is Asia. anatolia I must leave you gentlemen. Thank you, inspector, for all your help. I'm sorry, petrie, but this is where we part. - But I can't let you go alone. - It's better that way. You can be of more use to me in Istanbul. How? I want you to telegraph the home secretary's office in London. Use the standard code. Alright. Tell him that I intend to try to get into fu manchu's castle. But how do you know that fu manchu captured the castle? Besides, we have nothing but guesswork to go on. I have something here which may change your mind, doctor. This was found on a dead man nearby. Still guesswork, petrie? Dacoit's headscarf. - Goodbye, petrie! - Good luck! Curt, you mustn't do this. a doctor can't say no To saving a life. I know that, but you cannot do this if, by saving professor heracles' life, You are helping this murderer in his plans. do you believe that fu manchu will let heracles live After he's used him? I don't know. But we have to try everything. And nobody before tried to... To do such an... an operation. Do you... Do you think you can do it? yes, Yes, I know we can do it. I hope. Are you sure... You're not doing all this for me? Just to save my life? And ifitis so? We have not a chance. in this moment, You are the only person who matters to me. Come, please. A further warning to humanity. if the governments of all the nations do not accept my terms, in four days' time, I will bring desolation To mankind. Master, the spy you sent is back. Did you get close to the castle? Yes, master. Well then, speak. There are 15... Men guarding the castle. Yes? And what else did you see? Master... The girl, Lisa... Still lives. She's fu manchu's prisoner... She's to die in two days... When fu manchu's... Work is done. You've done well. The dacoit's headband. Bury this man with honor. Don't move, you fools. Tell your men to drop their arms quickly! Don't move, any of you. I am Omar pasha. And I'm nayland Smith of Scotland yard. I thought I could smell a policeman. It seems that for once you and I could be on the same side. I, too, seek fu manchu. You have done well, Dr. Kessler. His recovery will take a long time. We cannot afford to wait for complete recovery. as soon as he regains consciousness, He will be made to talk. And if heracles refuses? Need I remind you, doctor, that he has no alternative. And if I refuse to help you any further? Then you will sign this lady's death warrant. Your help during the operation was invaluable. We have no further use for you. No! look after your patient, doctor, And watch him well. Curt! Father. The guards have caught a spy, Omar pasha. - alone? - Yes, and unarmed, As if he invited capture. Have the girl, Lisa, brought to me. Yes, father. Who are you? Lisa. Did they do that to you? Is this the way... To treat a stranger in your house? You are no stranger to me, Omar pasha. But I never thought you to be a fool. Fools do not trade... With hives. give her back to me, And I will give you the head of your enemy. Enemy? Nayland Smith. Release him. my men are camped in the hills, on the other side of the bosphorus, overlooking this castle, Nayland Smith is their prisoner. I want this woman. She belongs to me. you shall have her, Provided that you give me nayland Smith. You have my word. Then you shall remain my guest. For how long? That, I shall decide. The girl! Let her go, she cannot escape. Take him to the laboratory. You are an obstinate man. how highly do you value your life Compared with that of nayland Smith? Try me. The entrance to eternity. beyond that door, there is a tunnel Which leads directly to the sea. Cisterns of water are poised above it. the touch of a lever will release hundreds of thousands of gallons of water into that tunnel, and combined with professor heracles' crystals, this can transform the entire sea Into one gigantic block of ice. Come now. Where is nayland Smith? if you'll free me and Lisa. When we find her. my men are camped in the pass, four kilometers from here, On the other side of the bosphorus. Nayland Smith is with them. He's awake. How're you feeling now? I feel nothing, but I am alive. You wish to remain alive, professor? You will see that he stays conscious for a few more minutes. Father, the attack was successful. Omar pasha"s men were all destroyed. And nayland Smith? Dead. This man saw him killed. I shall broadcast at midnight. - And heracles? - He will talk. You have explained to him the information I require from him? Yes, of course. Your task is now completed, Dr. Kessler. The formula, professor. No. Very well. It's hot in here. Then take your clothes off. A gentleman never takes his clothes off in public! Ah. Bring us some coffee, you lazy good for nothing. What on earth... No filters? This is my ultimatum. within the next few hours, the bosphorus and the city of Istanbul Will be destroyed. It's not true. It can't be true! - Dr. petrie. - The powers of the world... - calm yourself. - Have relied upon one man, Nayland Smith. Nayland Smith is dead. Master. The formula. with this, I can control all things And all men. The bosphorus. Flash the signal. Bad dreams”? The worst dreams are better than reality. Why? you think that, maybe, without this awful adventure, We would never have realized that we were in love. I've known it for a long time. I didn't see it. I didn't want you to see it. I didn't want to distract you from your work, your experiments, your investigations, Which were all so much more important than me. You did exactly right, Ingrid. thanks to those many hours of hard work during the professor's operation, I managed to gain access to some acid, Which I can now use against fu manchu. Keep quiet, I shan't hurt you. I'm from the police, Scotland yard. Fu manchu intends to destroy Istanbul! Please! Is there a radio transmitter? Yes, I can guide you. Follow me. Father! Father! Dr. Kessler and the girl, they have escaped. The have reached the tunnel. Excellent. and when the crystals are released into the tunnel, They will die. I think I've managed to break through to the London frequency. We're through! this is nayland Smith, Speaking from fu manchu's headquarters. Send a warning to the bosphorus. Nayland Smith. Nayland Smith. Come on! Look! Quick! Through the door! The professor. Come on, professor, we must get out of here. Go on! They have taken heracles. = come. Flood the tunnels! Ingrid, Ingrid, don't give up. Ingrid, quick. We must go on! Omar! I must go back for Omar! Come back! Come back! = Omar! Omar! Omar! Omar! Omar, where are you? Omar! Where are you? Omar! Omar! Omar! Omar... Omar! Kessler must've got through, the systems are bursting. Father. Father! Hey, Kessler, Kessler! Ingrid! I-I'm coming how as fast as I can push. I'm doing the best I can! Hang on! It's petrie, Ingrid! I... really am doing my best. The world shall hear from me again. The world shall hear from me again.
