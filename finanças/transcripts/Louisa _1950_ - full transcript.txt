Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Good evening, Mr. Norton. Getting home pretty late. - Couldn't be helped, Joe. - Couldn't you elbow a little? Forget about the train schedule? - Let's keep going, Joe, I'm in a hurry. - Alright. Mr. Norton, if you don't mind me saying, it won't work. Huh? Bringing home presents only makes a wife more suspicious. Right away she knows you did something wrong. Starts looking for the powder on your lapel, the lipstick on your handkerchief. Thanks for the advice, Joe, but I'm not in any trouble. Oh, then why all those? I'm celebrating. Joe, I'm going to be made a vice president of the firm. Well what do you know. Yes, the boss sprung it out to me tonight just as I was leaving the office. Well, of course it'll take the Board's okay, but that's pretty much in. Congratulations. - More dough? - Considerable. - I bet your family will blow it's top. - No, there'll be no holding them. We've been waiting for this for a long time. You should have seen my kids when I first got the cab. They ran out and patted it like it was a dog. Hey, Joe, you're passing the house. - Good evening, Gladys. - Good evening, Mr. Norton. Bought you a little present, Gladys. Nothing's going to make me change my mind, Mr. Norton. - About what? - You'd better speak to Mrs. Norton. I'll set your dinner on the table, if it isn't cooked enough and all ready. Hey, Chris. Notice anything different about your father tonight? No. Well, you might show a little more enthusiasm. Your father is going to be made a vice president. And I thought a vice president's son ought to have a new chemistry set. Second from the bottom. - Gosh, it's a big one. - Number 25, the atomic energy set. Oh, gee! It's swell, Dad! But I don't know if I'll be able to use it. Chemistry sets get awful messy. Guess you'd better send it back. Thanks anyway, Dad. Dad. I heard. Congratulations. Well, it's nothing to be sad about. Here, I brought you something too. Oh, I'm so glad for you, Dad. - So glad for you! - Kathy! I'm so glad for you, Dad. I'm so glad for you, Dad. Hiya, Corky. Meg, what's going on around here? - Meg? - In here, dear. You're awfully late tonight, darling. What kept you? - I had to stop off at Hattie Carnegie's. - Oh. Well, you'd better get cleaned up. You know how Gladys is about holding dinner. Meg, I said I had to stop off at Hattie Carnegie's. She is not a business associate. She sells very beautiful things for women. Like this. Oh, I'm sorry. I must have been a million miles away. Thank you, dear. You don't know the trouble I had getting into the store after 6 o'clock. I finally managed it. The sailsgirl missed her bus. I had to send her home in a taxi. Oh, here! It's the one I pointed out to you in the window - Repeatedly. - It was sweet of you, dear, it's very nice. Meg, what's going on is this house? I come home with the most wonderful news of my life. Burnisde finally offered me the vice presidency. And everybody around here acts like characters out of a Russian tragedy. Oh, it's nothing, dear, it's just a little family problem. There's no point in upsetting your day. It's already been upset! Well... if you must know... It's your mother. Again? At 9:30 this morning your mother asked me for something to do. So I let her do the shopping. At 9:45 she had a terrible argument with Mr. Hammond, the grocer. Your mother's been living in hotels these past ten years. She has no idea that prices have gone up since 1940. At eleven she complained about the way the house was being cleaned. Gladys's dusting didn't meet the finger test. At lunch she had a row with your son. She doesn't approve of the way he keeps his room. In her day all children were neat and clean... ...and their dogs didn't sleep on their beds. At 3:30 she had words with Cathy. She saw Jimmy Blake kiss Cathy goodbye and she considers this highly indecent. At 5:30 I arrived home after working hard on the charity dance all day... ...to be told that I was a poor wife and mother and that I was neglecting my family. And if you don't do something about it soon... I'll go crazy! Darling, it's not that serious. - I'll have another talk with Mother. - When? Right now. - I guess. - Hal, promise me something. You'll do the talking this time. Your mother's in the study. I'll put your dinner back on the stove. Come in. Good evening, Mother. Good evening, son. - Mother, I want to speak to you. - Just a moment, dear. There. I just heard the good news from Chris. It's just wonderful! I'm not at all surprised, though. My boy is just like his father. Thank you, Mother, but... It won't be long until you're president of the company. I just know it. Well, Mr. Burnside isn't ready to retire yet. Well, he should. You said he was sixty-five. - Mother, there's something else I want... - Son, guess who died. - Mabel Trenam. - I'm very sorry to hear it. You probably don't remember Mabel. But she was related to us. Well, not exactly. She married your second cousin Richard. Remember, the tall boy with the weak eyes? Mother, will you please let me say what I'd like to say? Why, of course, dear... Fix your handkerchief. Mother, you've only been living with us for little over a month. And, well, I realize it takes time for people to get used to one another... That's why I've tried to be helpful, son. Mother, without realizing it... you've caused a great deal of trouble. - Oh... - This is Meg's home. And much as you may not agree with her about a lot of things... she has to run it her own way. I thought that Meg would be grateful for my suggestions. Well, to be blunt about it, she's not. And Chris and Cathy aren't very happy either. Children aren't raised exactly as they were in your day. They resent being balled out by anyone except their parents. I'm afraid I made a mistake coming here, Harold. Oh, Mother, please. It's alright, dear. Your father left me well provided for. Perhaps it's best I live alone. Mother, if we hadn't wanted you t live with us we never would have asked you to. But... well, you have to make a life for yourself. Find some interest apart from the family. Son, this should be the happiest day of your life. I seem to have spoiled it for you. I'll see to it that you have nothing to worry about. I'll find something to do, I'll... ...keep out of everyone's way. - Oh... - Please, Harold, go. - Mother. - Please, go. Harold, it's just lovely. Harold, where are you going? I'm going to walk at least five miles to cool off. I'm celebrating the happiest day of my life. - Good morning, Christopher. - Good morning, Grandma. I'll get the room all straightened out before school. That's entirely up to you, Christopher. Come on, beautiful we'll be late. I can't find my Latin homework. Well, I hope you didn't lose it after I did it for you. Oh, here it is. Hi! Good morning, James. Good morning, Cathy. - Good morning, Mother, - Good morning, son. Good morning, Meg. - You're down late. - I'm sorry, I overslept. Mother, I'm afraid the eggs are cold. I'll have Gladys make a fresh batch. There's no need, I'm not very hungry. Just juice and coffee will do. Mom, I'm late, I haven't got time for breakfast. Chris, you can't sit in school with absolutely nothing in your stomach. - At least drink your milk. - Oh, Mom. There, that's my boy. There! - Bye, Dad. - Bye, Christopher. - I'm sorry, Grandma. - That's perfectly alright, Christopher. Oh, Mother, here's some mail for you. Well, aren't you going to read it? I receive one of these every week, I know what it says. Dear neighbor, won't you join our Pleasantville Ladies' Auxiliary Circle? Red Cross work, sewing, knitting. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning... ...ten to twelve. Mother, it sounds like fun. Why don't you try it? You'll make some new friends. It isn't easy to make friends at my age. Oh, you sound as if you were a hundred years old. Most of the women have lived here a long time. I'd be just an outsider. Oh, they wouldn't have sent you the card if they... Oh, there's my ride. I'll have to go. - Goodbye, Mother. - Goodbye, dear. I'll try to get home early tonight. Now, about the things you wanted me to bring back from the city... What things? What are you talking about? I don't like the way Mother's acting. Well, Hal, we can't expect miracles. She's hurt. It's going to take us a little time to prove we didn't mean to hurt her. Well do me a favor, will you, darling, I know you're busy with the Country Club dance, but, if you can find the time, take her for a ride or something. I'll find the time. Goodbye, darling. - Buy. - I'm coming. Oh Mother, I've been thinking. Why don't you come over to the Country Club with me? We can have a nice lunch and afterwards we can go for a drive. Thank you, but I'm afraid I'd be in the way. Are you sure you won't change your mind? I'm very comfortable, thank you. Oh, Gladys, I'm leaving. Is there anything you need? Better stop by the grocer's and pick up a sack of potatoes... ...and some shortening. I bet Mr. Hammond will be relieved to see you doing the shopping again. Gladys! Goodbye, Mother. Here, you left this in the dining room. Oh, thank you. Are you going to be in here much longer? This is my thorough-cleaning day. I'll go upstairs to my room. Gladys, I won't be home for lunch today. Excuse me, can you tell me where I'll find the Ladies' Auxiliary Building? You can't miss it. It's the gray building down at the end of the street. - Used to be the Fire Station. - Thank you. Be sure you deliver Mrs. Thomas' order first. She's having a luncheon. Yes, sir. - Good morning, Mr. Hammond. - Good morning, Mrs. Norton. - Mr. Hammond. - Yes? I owe you an apology. I'm afraid I made quite a scene in the store yesterday. But I didn't realize how much prices had gone up since 1940. I think it's best that the entire episode be completely forgotten. Excuse me. Good day, Mr. Hammond. Mrs. Norton. Please. - I didn't mean to seem so abrupt. - Rude. I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what's gotten into my temper these days. I'd try to control it. Particularly in your business. I do try, Mrs. Norton... But somehow as the years move on I get more and more crotchety. I know. My disposition hasn't been the same since my husband died... ...some ten years ago. My wife died a little over ten ago years too. Perhaps loneliness makes for anger. That's true. That's very profound. Couldn't we forget our little quarrel? It was bad temper on both sides. Good day, Mr. Hammond. Mrs. Norton... Older people don't have to be lonely. Mr. Hammond... I really must be going. - Mr. Hammond. - Yes? Can you tell me where I'll find the Ladies' Auxiliary Building? Yes, it's just er... I'll direct you personally. Meg, you're a genius. This month's grocery bill is down $25.00. How did you do it? To tell you the truth, Hal, I don't understand it myself. For some strange reason we've suddenly become Mr. Hammond's favorite customers. He's even sent over all sorts of delicacies. Smoked hams, imported sardines, fresh pineapple... And without any charge at all. That doesn't make sense. He's a businessman, he must have some reason. Good night, children. More bridge tonight, Mother? Don't the ladies ever get tired of playing cards? Oh, you don't ever get tired of anything you really enjoy. You look absolutely lovely, Mother. - The hat's so becoming. - Oh, thank you. It's one I've had for years. The milliner suggested a touch of color. It's a crime to waste it on a lot of women. Now son! Oh, by the way, I may be a little later than usual tonight. That's alright, Mother, you're a big girl. And we trust you. You won't be able to hop it up much. It's an old trade. It'll never be able to do better than a hundred. Oh, the Charleston's easy. I learned it in one lesson. - Oh, I'm sorry, mister. - Oh, that's perfectly alright, my boy. - How many, sir? - Two. - Two. - Love seats. Love seats. Thank you. Sherman, Vandenberg, Bradley represent Armed Forces unification... with Navy Sherman and Air Forces Vandenberg... ...collaborating at a Fort Benning, Georgia revue. Nothing is held back in this simulation of actual warfare. - Honey, relax, what's the matter? - Jimmy, I've got to go home. Bazookas take over! Machine guns! The infantry goes all out for unified defense of the nation! Good night, Jimmy. I have a right to know what's going on leaving a show right in the middle. Jimmy, please don't be difficult at a time like this. What am I going to tell my folks coming home at 10 o'clock? They'll think I'm sick. Cathy, we swore we'd be honest with each other. - If there's anyone else... - Jimmy, I love you more than... I'll call you up and tell you about it tomorrow. Mother, Father, come down here right away! Cathy, if anyone had ever told me I'd be waiting up with you for someone else... I still can't believe it. Mother definitely said she was going to play bridge. The only hand Grandma was holding tonight was Mr. Hammond's. You should have seen them sitting out there, and all those kids necking. - It was shocking! - What were you doing there, dear? - Seeing the movie. - Ha! And besides, I'm at an age when you're expected to do those things. Hal, let's go to bed. We're all taking this too seriously. Oh, it's very well for you to be casual. It happens to be my mother! Mother! Oh, you're up. Cathy come in late again? Grandma, it is not me! Well who is it then? Mother, Cathy tells me you were at the picture show. - With Mr. Hammond. - Holding hands in the love seats. I saw it with my own eyes. I didn't think you and Jimmy had a chance to see much of anything. Mother, have you been playing bridge... ...any of these nights? No, son. I've been seeing a good deal of Mr. Hammond. Well, don't you think you might have told us? She's ashamed because he's a grocer. Cathy, don't you ever say that again! The reason I didn't tell you, dear, is that I wanted to be absolutely sure first. Sure? Of what? Well, Mr. Hammond is rather impulsive. The second time we went out he proposed. But I insisted that we get to know each other better. You do now, I take it. He's a fine man. I know you're going to like him. Even though he's quite different from your father. He's... well, he's... I thought Father was a rather fine figure of a man! - And so did you at one time. - Oh, we all did, really, Hal. Perhaps I put it badly, son. It's just that Mr. Hammond is more... ...dashing. - More of an adventurer. - I think this is shocking! - Cathy, go to your room! - If I were running this house! Just shocking! I hate it to deceive you children, but... well... Perhaps I was afraid. Sometimes young people find it difficult... ...to understand when their parents fall in love. Oh, but Mother, I... Well, I've never met Mr. Hammond! We'll have him over to dinner, Mother, whenever you say. Oh, sure. We'll make it a big evening. Oh, you're very sweet children, thank you. Good night. I'm sorry I worried you. If I'd known, I wouldn't have stayed out so late. Where were you, Mother? The movies let out at midnight, it's after one now. We parked, son. How can Mother even consider marrying this... this grocer after a man like Dad? But Hal, Mr. Hammond's a very charming man. I've been doing business with him for years. - Oh, so you're on Mother's side. - I'm not on anyone's side. Your mother's entitled to a life of her own. You don't find men like David Norton anymore. Meg, you never really knew Dad. You never played baseball with him. I never played baseball with him but I was very fond of him. - This is all our fault. - Oh now, Hal! We weren't satisfied. We laid down the law to Mother about making a new life. We drove her right into the arms of the first grocer who came along. Hal, did it ever occur to you that your mother was lonely? She was looking for companionship. She's been a widow for over ten years. Why did she suddenly become lonely now? You just can't get used to the idea of your mother getting married, can you? Meg, I have a responsibility here. Mother has a comfortable income. She's just at the age to be an easy prey for the first fortune-hunter who comes along. Hal, you don't believe a word you're saying. I certainly do! - What's so funny? - I've never seen you in short pants before. Chris, move over. Have a fight with Mom, Dad? Son, as you grow older you'll discover that certain women... ...have a peculiar sense of humor. Now go to sleep. Hmm... just modern enough to be interesting... ...and not so modern that it's scaresome. Very impressive. Exactly what the Northeastern Mutual people think they want. When you draw up the plans, ignore the model completely. Fortunately no one in the insurance business knows how to read blueprints. We'll build it our way and they'll like it. They always have. What's ailing you? You haven't heard a word I've said to you for the past week. - You're a million miles away. - I heard every word you said, Mr. Burnside. What's the matter? Meg spending too much money? - No, it's not Meg. - Well, you're stewing about something. It's just a little romantic trouble at home. Your daughter, eh? How old is Cathy now? - Seventeen, but... - That's the age. Going with some fellow you don't approve of, eh? Mr. Burnside, I don't think I ought to burden you with a family problem. Nonsense. I have the advantage of not having a family. Permits me a clear perspective in this sort of thing. The answer is simple. Get the girl away from this fellow. Send her on a trip somewhere. She's old enough. She's old enough, but I don't think it would work. Mr. Burnside, I think we ought to get back to the plans. Ta-ta... - Miss Cartwright. - Yes, sir? Call Northeastern Mutual. Tell them there's been a delay. They won't have the plans till the first of the week. But why not? We can easily finish by tomorrow. Your mind's not here, it's back at the house. Now go home. Get this family affair straightened out over the weekend... ...and we'll start fresh on Monday. - But this is a rush job. - I'll handle Northeastern. Now beat it. You're the boss. And remember, be firm. Hello, anybody home? Better hang your hat and coat up. What's going on here? Haven't you heard? Winston Churchill's coming to dinner. Couldn't be making as much fuss over anyone else. Stop it, Gladys. Darling, Mr. Hammond's coming to dinner. Mr. Hammond is not due until Sunday afternoon. Oh, he had to change his plans. He can't make it Sunday. He's expecting a shipment of quail and pheasant from Canada. So we have to turn our lives upside down. Hal, I'm relying on you to be pleasant. I'll be overwhelmingly pleasant. I've studied up on vegetables... ...so we'll have a lot to talk about. - Oh... - Hal! You came home early, how nice. Oh, it's just beautiful, absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. Meg, this is ordinary pepper. Mr. Hammond says for proper seasoning you must use freshly-ground pepper. I'll help Gladys find the pepper mill. So, now that you're home early, you'll have time to dress. What do you mean dress? I am dressed. Put on a dark suit, dear. We all want to make the right impression on Mr. Hammond, don't we? Yes, Mother. Gee, Dad, do we have to dress for dinner? Come along, son. Seems kind of funny Grandma having a boyfriend. There's nothing funny about it. You should have the kids in the block when I told them about Grandma and Mr. Hammond. We all went down to congratulate him and got free bubble gums. Son, before this evening is over... ...your friends may have to go back to paying for their bubble gum. Change your clothes. Hi, Dad! Tell Mom Jimmy's staying for dinner. - Jimmy can't stay for dinner tonight. - Not so loud, he'll hear you. Good evening, Mr. Norton. Jimmy, you know we like having you for dinner, you're here every night. But would you excuse us just this once? But Mr. Norton, Cathy and I have got to get our debate paper finished. It's a big subject. "Adolescence and the Atomic Age" I appreciate the bigness of the subject. I'd have invited Cathy to my house, but my mother's having a bridge party. Now look... - Company? - Yes. Oh, you don't have to worry about me. I won't be in the way. I've got more research to do than Einstein. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening, Gladys. I guess I'm not used to seeing you at the front door. - You look nice, though. - Thank you. - Mr. Hammond, I'm Hal Norton. - How do you do? I've been looking forward to the pleasure of meeting you for some time. Well... I've been looking forward to meeting you. The uh... family isn't down yet. Could I get you a drink? Please. You know, some people consider drinking a vice. But in these times I think most of us feel the need of a little something... ...to relieve the strain and warm the heart. - Yes... - Scotch, if you have it. - Soda or water? - Oh, straight, please, if you don't mind. One shouldn't dilute the flavor of scotch, especially if it's good scotch. This happens to be 12-year-old. Splendid. Thank you. To your mother. To Mother. So you're expecting a shipment of pheasant and quail on Monday. Yes, they're being flown in. I'm hoping to build up a trade in game birds. I... Oh, but I... I don't think this is quite the night to talk shop. No... Mr. Hammond, I understand that you and my mother have a... A deep, personal attachment. Yes, well... Most of the members of my family, my wife and children seem to know a great deal about you but, uh... I personally... If there's anything you're curious about, just ask. - I have several questions of my own. - You have? Naturally. I'm marrying a woman with children. Mr. Hammond, we have no intention of living with you and Mother. Oh, I realize that, but one must be careful. I had a friend in the wholesale fruit business... A bachelor of Saxby, inexperienced in these matters. Poor man! After his marriage he found he was constantly... ...burdened with his wife's children. Emotionally and financially. Mr. Hammond, I've been working for the same firm for more than ten years... ...at a very comfortable salary. I'm sleighted for a vice presidency. If you like, I'll be happy to furnish a financial statement. Oh, nothing like that will be necessary. I was merely pointing out the element of risk. Well, if you feel the risk is too great... Mr. Norton, will you listen to this? All the way back in 1503, Leonardo da Vinci predicted the smashing of the atom... or something like it, I... - Oh, excuse me. - This is a friend of my daughter's. - Jimmy Blake. - Oh. Seems to me I remember your name from somewhere. Of course! You're the editor of the high-school paper. - For two terms. - I'm one of your advertisers. Fine paper. You read it, of course. Well, I'm a few issues behind. Jimmy, Mr. Hammond and I have some things to discuss. No, no, we'll have plenty of time for that. One mustn't lose touch with youth. These high-school papers are the voice of tomorrow. Oh, by the way, young Blake, there's an editorial of yours I found rather controversial. - I was thinking of writing you about it. - Which one? I believe it was called "Modern Women". "They Can Go Too Far." - You didn't miss it, Mr. Norton? - I'm afraid I did. Every word in that editorial is based on fact. Why, before I wrote it I spent a full hour and a half in the public library. One doesn't learn about women from the public library, does one, Mr. Norton? It's the hard way. - Now, Jimmy... - But what I said about women holds good. In ancient times she held a real position in society. She tended the goats, then raised the flocks. But today, today she's absolutely purposeless. This sounds to me like the talk of a young man who isn't too successful with women. Oh, I do alright. Why, there isn't a girl in school... - Jimmy! - ...that haven't been out with. Yes, Mr. Norton? Nothing... Let me pour you a glass of ginger ale. Henry. - Louisa! - Why didn't someone tell me you were here? You're a vision. A cameo of loveliness. You're so kind, Henry. - Do you really like the dress? - Yes! I added the lace myself. An exquisite touch. - Exquisite! - Thank you. - These are for you, my dear. - Oh, Henry. Oh, you shouldn't have. Tea roses. My very favorite. - How did you know? - When two people are as deeply attuned... - And what lovely candy. - A touch of sweetness... ...where none is needed. Would you like a little sherry, Mother? Er, not quite a full glass, son. Well, Henry, what do you think of my Harold? He's all the things you said, Louisa, and more. Warm, charming, gracious. Harold was always a wonderful boy. Mr. Norton used to worry that he was too good. Louisa, he used to say to me, it isn't natural. Some fine day that boy's going to run hog wild. - Mother. - But he never did. I don't think we should bore Mr. Hammond with family history. - Oh, but I'm interested. - So am I! I don't want you to get the impression that Harold was a mollycoddle. Oh, he used to get into all sorts of mischief and fights. He came home from school with his nose bloody every day. - Didn't you ever win a fight? - I won a great many! That reminds me. Harold, where is the family album? - The album? - We have some very cute... ...baby pictures of Harold with his wonders a trifle embarrassing. - Well, they're all grown up. - I'd like to see it. The album's around here somewhere. I'll find it. - Mother... - Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry I'm late. - Dinner is served. - Oh... shall we? A propos, in mixing a salad, there's an old English verse... ...which says, "A miser with the vinegar, a spendthrift with the oil... a wise man with the salt... judicious with the pepper... ...a madcap with the mixing. Ah... and now we have the final filip. To most people, the marigold is an ordinary flower... ...which you will find in anybody's backyard. But the taste... ah, that's something else again. Mark you, it must be used sparingly. Yes, some epicures get carried away. They forget they're making a salad... ...not planting a garden. There. You know, he's kind of cute. And kinda corny. Louisa. For you, my dear. Thank you, Henry. It's the most beautiful salad I've ever seen. And for the equally lovely young Mrs. Norton... Now, Gladys... Will you please serve the others? Oh, it's not going to sprout. Henry, you do everything so well. This is what I've missed for so many years, Louisa. Having someone to care for, someone with whom to share the good things of life. Dad, do I have to eat the flowers? You're on your own, son. This is Mr. Hammond's evening. - Hm, it's delicious! - The most wonderful salad I've ever tasted. It's simply divine! It's good! Thank you. Now you know why I became a grocer. To bring that extra special taste sensation to the palate. Henry considers himself an adventurer of the senses. When I first shipped out to the sea when in the British Navy... I was accostumed to the usual British fare. Roast beef and badly cooked vegetables. And then in my travels, I discovered the food wonders of the world. Ajinomoto, from Japan, pomelo and poppy seeds from India, rijsttafel from Borneo, baby octopus. You mean you actually ate an octopus? Yes, there's nothing like it. One doesn't eat the tentacles, no. Just the delicious meat around the heart. People in Pleasantville just eat steaks and chops and things like that. Mr. Hammond has a very poor opinion about them. Well, that's because they haven't had a chance to learn from Mr. Hammond. Mr. Hammond, were you really in the British Navy? Yes, indeed. I first shipped out in His Majesty's ship Portsmouth in let me see... 1897. No... no, no, no, 99. I ran away to sea at thirteen. Was it a sailing ship? No, not the Portsmouth. But I did work the whaling fleet some time. After your grandmother and I get back from our honeymoon, I can see we're going to have some good talks about sailing ships, matey. Gee, Mr. Hammond, you'll make a swell Grandpa. Why, Henry, I haven't said yes yet. My dear, we haven't all the time in the world. You should come to a decision. Well... Gladys, the doorbell. Oh! Good evening, Mr. Norton at home? Yes, through the hall, inside in the dining room. Excuse me, I don't want to miss anything. What do you say, Louisa? Well, who is it, Gladys? To tell you the truth, ma'am, I didn't ask. Mr. Burnside! What a pleasant surprise, Mr. Burnisde. How are you? - Just fine, Meg, and you? - Fine. More beautiful than ever, I see. Harold, I hate to break in on a family dinner but I had to drive up. Northeastern Mutual insist upon having the housing plans by Monday. I couldn't talk them out of it. I knew it. Well, we'd better go into the study. Oh, there's not that much rush. Finish your dinner first. Well, Cathy, you're a real young lady now, eh? Mr. Burnside, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Jimmy Blake. How do you do, young man? Mr. Norton and I have had quite a talk about you just today. - Mr. Burnside, this is Mr. Hammond. - How do you do? Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I forgot. You don't know my mother. I've never had the pleasure. I've only come to live with Harold very recently. If I'd known I'd been up here long before this. Now I can see where your son gets his good looks. Oh, thank you. Mr. Burnside, will you have some dessert and coffee with us? Just some coffee, thank you. A little brandy, if you have it. I'll get the brandy. Harold does nothing but speak of you, Mr. Burnside. How wonderful you've been. Now, now, now, everything I've done for Harold he's deserved. I've had a great many people work for me. but never anyone as consciencious, as honest, as talented as Howard. Spring is in the air. Of course there may be a little difficulty about the vice presidency. The board may object to Harold's youth. But don't you worry, I'll fight it through. Hal, your uncle's got a bad cold. I'm not anyone's uncle. I'm a friend of Mrs. Norton's. - A very dear friend. - Excuse me. Say, that's good brandy. It was a gift from Mr. Hammond. - Tell me, Hammond, what line are you in? - I run a grocery store. - Just one? - Just one. I suppose the grocery trade is as good as any. There may not be a great deal of money in it... - ... but people have to eat. - It's more than that with Mr. Hammond. - He's an adventurer of the senses. - Sort of a... poet with pot roast. Mr. Burnside, some time ago I completed a statistical survey of the average business tycoon. By and large, I found him dyspeptic, ulcerous, and thoroughly miserable... - ...to himself and everyone around him. - Henry! I'm sorry to disappoint Mr. Hammond, but I don't fit his survey. Good digestion, blood pressure of a boy of thirty, happy, and I think my employees are pretty fond of me, eh, Hal? There's no one I'd rather work for. Would you say that if you weren't on his payroll? - Yes, I would! - Oh, please, please. Henry, I've never seen you behave this way before. Mr. Burnside... Delicate old lavender. Not like the vulgar, overpowering perfumes of today. - Thank you - If you'll excuse me, I have some accounts to go over at the store. Thank you for a very lovely dinner. Good night... everyone! Why... - Henry! - No! Henry! Henry, I'm surprised at you! You were very rude. How do you think I felt watching you lead Mr. Burnside on? - Henry! - Flirting shamelessly before my very eyes. I was simply being courteous to Harold's employer. Don't tell me you didn't enjoy his attentions. Dropping your handkerchief coyly like a schoolgirl. That trick's a bit dated, Louisa. You're being very insulting, Henry! Well, perhaps it's better that I found out now. I wouldn't care for a wife I'd have to keep a constant watch on. Henry Hammond, you'll do me the favor of never speaking to me again! I'm glad I too found out in time. Louisa, please! I'm sorry! I'm a jealous fool! - Mr. Hammond... - Meg. Hal and I just came up with a practical idea. Instead of sitting up half the night working, I'll stay over the weekend. In that way we can get everything done without pressing. Oh, but Mr. Burnside, we don't have a guest room. That will come with the vice presidency. I'm sure you can put me up somewhere. I'm not too finnicky. Chris can sleep over at Tommy's. He's done it before. - If the little fella wouldn't mind too much. - Ahh! Oh, he won't mind, Mr. Burnside. Chris is just like his father. Easily moved around. Hal, I never realized it until now. But I think I miss something. Not having a family. In a recent magazine article, Professor Albert Einstein stated... "In these first years of the atomic era, another phenomenon is to be noted. The public having been warned of the consequences of atomic warfare, has done nothing about it... and to a large extent has dismissed the warning from its conscience." You know, I recognize Professor Einstein as a very great man. Yet, I must disagree with him. He's completely disregarded our generation. Oh, Jimmy, that's so impressive. It is, isn't it? But... somehow, the atom bomb doesn't seem so important. And you're so intellectual too. A man doesn't have to be narrow. When I think of all the crushes I've had. On Rick Harris, Dave Williams and Red Christy. All football players with nothing but muscles. I guess it's because I matured so young. Most people think that maturity comes with age, but it doesn't. Look at what happened tonight. What? The way the old folks were acting. Like lovesick kids and your father not knowing what to make of it. I suppose your family is more mature? Well, they don't carry on like that. My father isn't the brightest man in the world, but he wouldn't let anything silly as that throw him. Go ahead and say it. My father is stupid. Oh, Cathy, we have to be objective, even with our families. We've got to see our parents the way they are. Not the way we like them to be. I like your father as a man, but remember... it's his generation that got the world in the shape it's in. Well, I don't like anyone making cracks about my family. They're just as good as anyone else's. Better! Still an adolescent. I want four complete changes of wardrobe including my dinner jacket. I know it's for only for one weekend. Will you stop asking questions, Miss Cartwright? You're my secretary, not my mother. Oh, yes. On your way up here tomorrow... ...stop at Cartier. Pick out a small brooch. Something very simple and dignified. With an "L" in the center... ...for Louisa. Mother. Mother! Cathy, will you please keep your voice down? You're not debating. Mother, do you realize that I've been trying to use... ...the phone since 9 o'clock this morning? So have I, dear. Well, why don't you do something about it? It's your house. We'll have a switchboard installed tomorrow. - Cathy! - Just listen! - Henry, there's no use trying to explain. - It's too late. They just talk, talk, talk. And every time Grandma hangs up on him he calls right back. It's awful. I don't even know whether Jimmy's called up to apologize or not. Well, you'll just have to be patient and bear the suspense. You take Grandma's love life very seriously. - But nobody pays any attention to mine. - Now Cathy, stop it! The Country Club dance is tonight and I've got a million things to do. Won't you please ask Grandma not to use the phone for just a half hour? I will not. Goodbye, dear. - Dad, I think I left my book in here. - Well, find it quickly, please. - Cathy, is your grandmother down yet? - No, she isn't, Mr. Burnside. A subterraneum garage will give us enough ground space for a swimming-pool... ...and a children's playground at no extra cost per unit. Does she usually come down this late? Sometimes, sometimes not. This makes it one of the most attractive housing projects in the country. She's well, isn't she? Perfectly. Cathy, will you please decide which book is yours, or don't you remember what you were reading? It doesn't matter. Any book will do now. I always associated books with Jimmy. Oh, Cathy, we're busy. You convinced us you were heartbroken at breakfast. Excuse me for disturbing you. There's one thing about my family. Nobody believes in being unhappy unless everyone knows it. You should be a little more tolerant, Hal. Remember, you were young yourself once. Your mother will be down to lunch, won't she? Yes, Mr. Burnside. Now, as I was saying, by putting in a subterraneum garage here, this new space... - ...capacity crowd will be packing the Yankee Stadium this afternoon. - - With the season only three weeks old, here in New York... - - ...the experts are again touting the Bronx Bombers for another pennant. - Chris! If you want to listen to that thing, go upstairs. - At any rate, the Athletics are here in town. - I promised Chris I'd take him to the baseball game this afternoon. He's peeved because I can't go. This is a subtle way of letting me know. These kids of today are pretty rugged individualists. I live in a house full of rugged individualists. Excuse my disturbing you. - I believe I left my sewing. - Mother, it couldn't possibly be in here. Here it is. I hope you slept well, Mrs. Norton. As well as to be expected. - Sorry, I won't interrupt again. - It will be a pleasure. As I was saying... the space we'll save by putting in a subterraneum garage... It's a fine idea. - What is a fine idea? - Whatever you were saying is a fine idea. Mr. Burnside, perhaps we'd do better... ...if we went back to the city and worked at the office. Nonsense, we're making great progress. Mr. Burnside, there are so many distractions. I really think... I'm having no trouble concentrating. Go on. Dad, I gotta use the dictionary. You couldn't find any other time but this. What are you looking up that's so important? Prevaricator. One who lies, who does not tell the truth. One who makes a promise and does not keep it. Can be either male or female. Very clever, Chris. Now go to your room. - Yes, sir. - Hal, if you ask me, I think Chris has a point. There's no work in the world more important than a good baseball game. Mr. Burnside, Chris has to learn that he can't always have his own way. There's plenty of time for him to learn that when he grows up. Now, you take Chris to the game. If the Northeastern people make a fuss, I'll tell them you're tied up on the Yankee's Athletics project. Now don't stand there. The game starts at two. But Mr. Burnside, I only have two tickets. Don't you worry about me. I'll keep occupied. Gee, thanks, Mr. Burnside. Come on, Dad, I brought your coat and my jacket downstairs just in case. I'll see you at dinner. Mr. Burnside, I thought you wanted to see the Country Club. - You drove right past it. - Did I? Well, a drive in the country will do us much more good. Oh, really, I don't feel in the mood for a drive, not today. Louisa, when I first set eyes on you last night, I said to myself... Now there's a girl who doesn't need makeup. She has roses on her cheeks. You've got to bring those roses back. I do look a little pale, don't I? All this fuss with Henry has been terribly... No, no, let's forget all about Henry Hammond. I'll make a bargain with you. I won't mention him if you won't. I really think we ought to turn back. Henry may call and... You're not keeping your part of the bargain. Mr. Burnside, do you always drive this fast? I bought my first car in 1905 and I got my first ticket the same day. Nobody knew whether 20 mph was illegal or not. But I was arrested for disturbing the peace and scaring the horses. It's always been my motto. Disturb the peace if you have to... ...but get where you're going. I was a bit daring myself when I was younger. I'm sure you were lovely enough to get away with anything. It doesn't sound like much now, but I smoked a cigarette way back in 1915. No! You should have seen Mr. Norton's face. Louisa, he said to me, I thought I married a lady. David, I said to him, I thought you married me. I thought you married m... Louisa, you are wonderful! Please, Mr. Burnside, not so fast. Don't worry, Louisa, we can do 100 without a bit of trouble. Please, Abel, slow down just a little. I deeply apologize for being in your way, hot rod. - Were you in a hurry? - Just give me the ticket, officer... I'm in no mood for conversation. Abel, I ought to be very angry with you. - Why? - Making Gladys go to all the trouble... ...of preparing a picnic lunch and not saying one word to me about it. Gladys insisted on doing it. After you gave her twenty dollars. Louisa, I've never had more fun in my life. I shall remember this afternoon always. - And I hope you will too. - It's been very pleasant. Louisa, I was wondering if you would accept this. - Oh! - As a remembrance of today. Abel, it's very beautiful. But I couldn't accept anything so expensive. Now, now, now, it's only value is a sentimental one. It belonged to my mother. Her name was Lottie. I don't think it would be right for me to accept a gift from another man. No matter how small, I'm still practically engaged to Mr. Hammond. - Louisa, may I speak frankly? - Of course. Well, since you brought up Henry Hammond, I think we should discuss him. Tell me, before you met him, how long was it since you had a date? Well, about forty years. Your children were not as attentive as they should be? Oh, they have their own lives to lead, I couldn't... - You were lonely? - Yes. Well, don't you see, it all adds up. You were lonely, you were unhappy, you hadn't had a date in forty years. You were bound to fall for the first man who came along. - But I'm very fond of Mr. Hammond. - Only because there was no one else around. Louisa, I'm speaking to you as a friend. I want you to wait, for your own sake. Go out with other men. Play the field. And then make up your mind. I didn't quite see it that way. And I want you to wear this. It would make my mother very happy. Abel, aren't those water lilies beautiful? I'll get you some. Oh, no, you mustn't! - It isn't allowed. - Nonsense. They'll look much lovelier in your arms than they do floating around on that water. They are lovely. Oh, Abel. - Now be careful. - Just a few more. What do you think you're doing, Grandpa? Well, I... What does it look like I'm doing? Picking flowers on public property is against the law. But officer, he didn't know. At his age he ought to know. If I wasn't afraid you'd catch your death of cold, I'd run you in. I feel perfectly fine. Ma'am, you'd better bundle the old boy up and take him home. I'm saving you a 10 dollar fine, Grandpa. Thank you, officer. Here's your fine. And ten more to get your clothes pressed. - For you, Louisa. - Thank you. I think we'd better get out of here. Why can't this be a plain, ordinary Country Club dance? Why do I have to wear a getup like this? Hal, everybody's square-dancing these days. Besides, you hate formal clothes. You complain about the collars. Well, there must be some middle ground between getting all starched up... - ...and wearing something that itches. - Now stop it, darling. Remember, you're the chairwoman's husband. That means I'm entitled to scratch twice as much. Cathy, we're late... now! It's going to be a perfectly rotten evening, I can just feel it. Cathy, there are other boys in this world besides Jimmy. We're sitting with the Stewarts and they're bringing Bob. It's exactly what I mean. Mother, the Stewarts may be very good friends of yours... ...but their son is a bad piece of arrested development. Hal, what are you waiting for? - Mother. - She's not going to the dance. She told me this morning she had a headache and didn't feel up to it. Things have changed since this morning. Hold on, don't leave without us. I'm warning you, we're going to walk off with all the prizes. I bet he will. # Swing your partners high and low # # Come on boys, don't be slow # # Alabama clap with two left hands # # That's right, dear honey # # Go right, left turn # # Hand up, hand up on the top # # Make your feet go click, click, click # # Swing your partners high and low # # Come on boys, don't be slow # # Alabama clap with two left hands # # That's right, dear honey # # Go right, left turn # # Hands up, hands up on the top # # Make your feet go clickety clack # # Get your woman and give her the swing # # Promenade home with a beautiful thing # # Where the roosters crow # # and the wild birds grow # # Promenade that pretty girl home # # All couples balance and bounce # Say, your mother and Burnside are the center of attraction.

Young man, that's what I tried to explain to you about your editorial. Oh, it's a curse being intellectual. Look at Cathy! Actually cuddling with that... drip. He reads comic books. Hmm... Mrs. Norton is equally captivated with that tycoon. Yeah, he's certainly giving her a whirl. Blake, no one ever accomplished anything on the outside looking in. Shall we join the ladies? # Back to your honey # # With the left hand down # # Promenade the corner when she comes down # # Promenade you know where # # Take that gal to an easy chair # Keeno! I don't know when I've enjoyed dancing so much. Louisa, I didn't believe any woman in the world could be so light on her feet. Oh, Abel. Where does he get that line? If you ask me, they're both being exhibitionists. You were wonderful, Mrs. Norton. Oh, thank you. Good evening, Louisa. Good evening, Henry. - Hi, Cathy. - Hi. Well, aren't you going to invite us to sit down? Mr. Hammond and I forgot to get up a table. Oh, yes, of course, please join us. Thank you. Sure, pull up some chairs. This is Jimmy Blake. You all know Mr. Hammond. Louisa, I called you several times this afternoon. You were not at home. I was showing Mr. Burnside some of the sights of Pleasantville. Too bad you couldn't have been with us. - We had a fine time. - Counting money? Oh, speaking of money, the dance is a great success. We've taken in over $1.300 for the day nursery. That's splendid. Uh, tell me, Mr. Burnside, after what you're accostumed to, don't you find our suburban festivities just a bit rustic? It's as pleasant a gathering as I've ever attended. Or was, until a few minutes ago. Intruders are a curse we all have to bear. How about some drinks? Lil? Dick? - How about you, Mr. Burnside? - We have ours. - To you, Louisa. - Oh! Well, Bob, how are the new comics? Drop dead! Jimmy, won't you have a root beer or something? No, thanks. You might have answered the phone this afternoon. I didn't happen to be in the mood. A girl's entitled not to answer the phone if she doesn't want to. - Yeah, you ought to know. - Why don't you get lost? Are you sure someone won't have a drink? I'm gonna have a drink. Waiter. Louisa, I'd like to speak to you... alone. Not now, Henry. I'm here with Mr. Burnside. The young man had a very good idea. Why don't you get lost? As usual, Mr. Burnside, you're displaying your complete lack of manners. Hammond, I take that as an insult! - That's precisely the way I meant it. - Oh, please! Please... please... Mr. Hammond, shall we? Dad, please. Louisa. Now that we have you all out on the floor, we are ready for our contests. First, an under-the-bar dance. Remember, couples must dance together at all times... ...and if you knock down the bar, you will be eliminated. How far do they lower that bar? Not very far. Never more than two or three feet from the floor. No, it's fun, Dad, really. - Well, Mrs. Norton? - I'm game. Abel, this isn't for us. Anything anyone else here can do, we can do. - Oh, Dad, why didn't you duck in time? - I'm sorry, Cathy, I have a tall head. Oh, it was my fault, Mr. Hammond. I was careless, I... Well, accidents will happen, Mrs. Norton. It doesn't matter... ...very much. Inhale. Am I through? We'll never make it. Drop out. This is outrageous! Everyone's quitting! They're just afraid if the old fool goes around again, he'll collapse The winners of the under-the-bar dance, Mrs. Louisa Norton and Mr. Abel Burnside. Thank you, thank you very much! It's the first time I ever won a prize for anything. The important thing is we won it together. Things are going swimmingly, aren't they? Meg, at this stage of the game I don't care whom my mother marries. Just let her make up her mind, then we can all relax. How many of you gentlemen feel strong? Our next contest, Indian wrestling. You dreamed this one up. Is this a dance or a track meet? Shhh! I thought it would be nice for the young people. We have to consider them too. Well, why don't you two get it over with? Ma, that's kid stuff. That's the first grown-up thing you've ever said. I would like to wrestle Mr. Burnside. If he'll accept the challenge. I've never yet failed to meet a challenge. I'll be back very quickly. - Hal, why don't you stop them? - I will not. You men know the rules? Take your positions. One, two, three, go! Come on, Mr. Hammond, come on! Mr. Hammond, hang on! Pull back, pull back! You got him, you got him! Don't give up, Mr. Hammond, don't give up! Pull him the other way now... pull him the other way! Up, Mr. Hammond, pull him, pull him! The winner, Mr. Abel Burnside. - Well, Louisa? - You brute! You hurt him! Henry, dear, are you alright? Just a little sprain, Louisa. Nothing very serious. We'd better go right home put some liniment on it. I'll never forgive myself. It was all my fault. I'm going back to the city. Bring my things to the office with you Monday. But Mr. Burnside... Well, you have nothing to worry about now. I've just said goodbye to the vice presidency. Meg, I won't be home for dinner. I have to wait till Burnside shows up. Your guess is as good as mine. There's been no sign of him since he left the dance Saturday night. We've checked everywhere. Oh, there's nothing to be worried about. I'll make it as early as possible. Bye. Do you want me to stay any longer, Mr. Norton? Oh, there's no point is our both sweating it out. - Good night, Miss Cartwright. - Good night. - Hal! - Mr. Burnside, where have you been? Never mind where I've been. What happened? Well, the Northeastern Insurance people have been calling up every fifteen minutes. The plans are finished but I couldn't send them over without your okay. I don't mean that! What happened? My mother is marrying Mr. Hammond on Sunday. You never should have thrown him in the Indian wrestling. Well, it's got to be stopped. I've got a full report on our friend Mr. Hammond. Listen to this. Henry Hammond, born Liverpool, England, 1883. The first lie! Said he was 64. He's 67! - Where did you get this information? - Where do you think? I spent the last 48 hours with the best detective agency money could buy. Didn't get a wink of sleep all weekend. Just to find out about Mr. Hammond's age? Wait till you hear the rest. Our friend Hammond is quite a character. Can't say I didn't suspect it from the beginning. Mr. Burnside, I don't know what you found out about Mr. Hammond... ...but I don't want to get involved. I have no right to meddle in my mother's life. What kind of a man are you? Don't you love your mother? Aren't you interested in her welfare? Here, read it yourself! - No, thank you. - I don't like people who are stubborn. Hal, I had great plans for you. If you want a vice presidency... Mr. Burnside, my business life is one thing, my personal life is another. - I won't be threatened. - Hal, you're fired! You're not serious. I was never been more serious in my life. If I weren't so tired, I'd throw you out personally. I've enjoyed working for the company. Thank you, Mr. Burnside. Here, I leave this with you. Read it and find out what a fool you really are. Mother, you simply refuse to make sense. You're a grown woman. I don't understand your attitude. I won't read another word. I just don't believe it. There's no point in saying you don't believe it. It's right here in black and white. Someone has made a great mistake. - Must be another Henry Hammond. - Mother, this is not a coincidence. There is no other grocer in Pleasantville named Henry Hammond. I'll get Henry on the phone. He'll be able to explain. I forbid you to speak to him. Or ever to see him again. I didn't realize how much you disliked Mr. Hammond. It isn't a question of liking or disliking. The last thing I want is to intefere in your life. But since you won't listen to reason, there's nothing else I can do. Son, I love Mr. Hammond. When you love a man, you know him. He never did anything bad in his life. That's the kind of logic I'd expect from Cathy. We plan to spend the rest of our lives together. Without Henry I don't know what I'd do. I'd just want to die. Oh, Mother, please stop crying. You should be grateful we found out in time. - Children, what is this? - Dad's raising the roof with Grandma. Will you please go to your rooms! I don't like eavesdropping. I just happened to be passing by. Mother, what's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Hal, would you mind telling me what this is about? I will not have my mother married to a bigamist. That sounds sensible. Bigamy to most people means being married twice. But not to Henry Hammond. He's no piker. - He has four wives. - Hal, that's ridiculous. You're as bad as Mother. Here, read it yourself. He was married four different times in four different cities. New York, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Tallahassee, Florida. He wasn't partial. He spread out all over the country. And there's no record of a divorce anywhere. - Where did you get this? - Mr. Burnside had the brains to hire... - ...a good detective agency. - And you approved? It's a darn good thing he did. Hal, I didn't realize how much you wanted that vice presidency. Thank you. Thank you. I wanted it so much I got fired for refusing to even look at the report. Hal, I'm sorry. Before my mother's love life burst into flower, I was a simple, honest, hard-working citizen... with a job, a family I was proud of... ...and a wife who respected me. Well, you can all go to blazes! Going out, Dad? Tell your mother I'm going for a long walk! I may not be back for two years! What a family. - Feel better? - I don't know. Hal, we're really in pretty good shape. If we let Gladys go and economize on a few other things... ...like Chris and Cathy's tennis lessons, we can easily get by for at least six months. - Our grocery bill will go up. - Even with that... Oh, forgive me, dear, I'm terribly sorry. I should have known you better. Why do wives always say I should have known you better after it's all over? Because I'm a shrew. No, you're not. I'm sure Mr. Burnside will change his mind after all the fuss dies down. Oh, no. There is no fury like a discarded lover of sixty-five. Particularly when it's Mr. Burnside. Well, there are a lot of other jobs. Your husband has some reputation as an architect. I hope. We'll be able to get by and you won't have to give up Gladys. - You're just afraid of my cooking. - Where are you going? I think I ought to go in and see how Mother is. She was awfully broken up and I thought it best to leave her alone for a while. Mother. Mother. Mother. Hal! Hal! - What's the matter? - Mother isn't here. Well, when did she go out? - I don't know. I haven't seen her since she left the study. I have a pretty good idea where she is. What is Henry Hammond's number? He lives over the store. It's 20492. I only hope it's not too late. - His fifth wife! - Darling, please calm down. Mr. Hammond, I would like to speak to my mother! Who is this? Oh, Mr. Norton, is something wrong? Now look, Mr. Hammond, don't try to bluff me. I know my mother's with you, she couldn't be anywhere else. Mr. Norton, did something happen to Louisa? I'll dress and come right over. There's no need for that. Are you positive you haven't seen her, or spoken to her? Well, she probably went for a walk or something by herself. Yes, I'll keep you posted, goodbye. She's not there. Are you sure Mr. Hammond's telling the truth? He's just as worried as we are. Maybe Grandma did what she said she was gonna do. And what is that? Well, Grandma said without Mr. Hammond she'd just wanna die. Oh, that's ridiculous, Chris... She was just using a figure of speech. People say things like that just to be dramatic. They don't mean it. Usually. Operator? Get me the Police Department. Hal, let's be sensible. We don't need the police yet. She did say it. Hello, this is Harold Norton, 321, Harper Drive. I want to report a missing person. My mother. Mrs. Louisa Norton. I thought I sent you to bed over an hour ago. I can't sleep, Dad. I'm too worried. Just thinking about Grandma running away from home. Jimmy, I know it's late, but we need someone, please... Cathy! Will you please get off that phone? Jimmy, you've just got to come over. It's a very serious situation. And they're all acting so childishly. We need someone who's mature. Cathy! Please, Jimmy, I know it's late but you can make up for sleep in Latin tomorrow. Hurry! - Yes, Dad? - How can you tie up the phone... ...at a time like this? Dad, you just called the police again five minutes ago. If they have anything to tell you, they'll call you. Just stay off the phone, that's all. Well, frankly, I think you're making too much of a fuss over this whole thing. You've always had a tendency towards melodrama. Oh, Cathy, will you please shut up? Mother! Well, I still don't believe Grandma would do anything foolish. Cathy, you are seventeen years of age. You have no idea of the behavior of people in their sixties. There are hundreds of statistics to prove that they become despondent and then... - Well... - I may not know statistics... ...but I now Grandma. Maybe we're on the wrong track. Maybe Grandma was kidnapped. - Like father, like son. - Now, Cathy, look! I thought some coffee might help. - Ma, can I have some. - No, Chris, you just drink your milk. Here, this ought to make you feel better. There's no coffee in the world can do that, ...regardless of what the advertisers tell you. Why did I have to open my big mouth? Why did I even look at that report? Darling, it isn't your fault. You couldn't have done anything else. That must be the police! You go. No... I'll go. - Mr. Burnside. - Hal, I've been doing some serious thinking. I'm not going to let your stubborness jeopardize Louisa's whole future. - Tell her I want to see her. - My mother isn't here! I might have expected that from you. I demand to see her and nothing's going to stop me! Louisa... Louisa! Meg, where's Mrs. Norton? Mother's been missing since early this evening. - Why, that's impossible. - It is not impossible! We've had the police on the phone all night. They're even dragging the river. - How did it happen? - I read your report and laid down the law. That did it. I'll get that detective agency on the phone right away. That detective agency's gotten us in enough trouble already. Poor Louisa. My poor, poor Louisa. Perhaps this will be a lesson to all of us. Hello? Yes, this is Mr. Norton. Yes. Yes. No, she isn't! What kind of Police Department are you running? - If she were home, I'd have called you! - Give me that phone. This is Abel Burnside speaking! Now you boys had better snap to it or you'll be pounding a beat in the suburbs. This is the suburbs. Well... we... well you... You'll be in real trouble! Now put your mind to it. She's not a hard woman to find. I'll expect a report from you in the next half hour. Hal, you can have your job back. - If you want it. - Thank you. Thank you very much. That's Louisa. I can feel it. - I'm very good at hunches. - Mother has her own key. - Mr. Norton! - Jimmy... This is a fine time to come calling. What's the matter with your parents? - Goodbye! - I asked him to come. I thought it would help to have someone around here who wasn't emotional. - Good night, Jimmy! - But Mr. Norton, I just passed Mr. Hammond's grocery store. There were lights on the second floor and there's a woman up there. - Now, I'm not saying it's your mother... - She's married. She couldn't be. It takes five days to get married in this State. The blaggard! Why, that lying, conniving... He told me on the phone... - Is your car outside? - It's in the driveway. Come on! - Ma. - Chris, you stay here. Aw, Ma, I always miss everything. If he thinks this is an airplane, he's flying too low. Mr. Burnside, can't we please slow down a bit? Before I get through with that senile Casanova he'll regret the day he was born. I'll tear him limb from limb. We're going to have a chance of getting Mr. Hammond with your hands on the wheel. Young woman, I was driving an automobile before you were born. I saw her through that window, only the lights were on then. - How do we get up there? - There's a bell here. Open up, come on, open up! Mr. Burnside, there's no use waking up the whole neighborhood. Open up, I say! - Who is it? - You know blasted well who it is. Open this door! Where is she? What have you done with her? - Tell me! - How can I tell you when I can't breathe? Abel Burnside, take your hands off him immediately! - Louisa! - Mother! - Grandma! - You scum! Hal, Meg, do something! Mr. Burnside, this isn't helping. Don't hold me, let me kill him! Mother, get your things. We're going home. Harold, I don't like your tone. Mr. Hammond's housekeeper is here and it's all very proper. - That's hardly an explanation, Mother. - I don't make a practice of lying. But under the circumstances, I thought it advisable for Mrs. Norton to be my guest here. Until we are married! Aren't you forgetting your other four wives, Mr. Hammond? Let me handle this bluebeard! Abel, will you stop hitting Henry? Now, if Mr. Burnside will... remain with the squash... ...just a few seconds, I'll... I'll tell you all about my four wives. Very decent of you! I hope it's as good as your performance on the phone. Harold, at least give Mr. Hammond the courtesy of listening. Thank you, my dear. Do you have the names of the women? I have a man on all fours and he's checking those little details right now. You're going to be very disappointed, Mr. Burnside. They are all the same woman. I loved my late wife very dearly. Call it sentimental, if you like. But every ten years, no matter where we were We took out a new license and were married all over again. Well, why didn't you tell us before? Even if we had, you'd have found something else to make a fuss about. Harold, you didn't like the idea of my getting married from the beginning. I suppose all children feel the same way about their parents. But I let you grow up and become independent. Don't you think I'm entitled to the same privilege? Yes, Mother. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here... ...to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together... let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace. Henry, wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife... ...so long as ye both shall live? I will. Louisa, wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband... ...so long as ye both shall live? I will. Who giveth this woman to be married to this man? The flowers. Repeat after me. - I, Henry, take thee, Louisa... - I, Henry, take thee, Louisa... - to my wedded wife... - to my wedded wife... - and thereto I plight thee my troth. - and thereto I plight thee my troth. Louisa, repeat after me. I, Louisa, take thee, Henry, to my wedded husband... I, Louisa, take thee, Henry, to my wedded husband... - and thereto I give thee my troth. - and thereto I give thee my troth. The rings. Bless, O Lord, this ring. That he who gives it, and she who wears it... ...may abide in Thy peace and continue in Thy favor under their life's end. Amen. Place the ring on Louisa's finger, hold it there and repeat after me. - With this ring... - With this ring... - I thee wed. - I thee wed. - Amen. - Amen. Join right hands. For as much as Henry and Louisa have consented together in holy wedlock, ...and have witnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have given and pledged their troth each to the other... ...and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and joining hands, I pronounce that they are man and wife. Amen. It'll never last. Mother, how can you be so sentimental? Cathy, it's just beautiful at any age. Here... hand me that. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
