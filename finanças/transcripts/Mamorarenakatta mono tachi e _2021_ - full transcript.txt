You have experience ﻿I'm a level-2 machinist. ﻿Tone here, doesn't need training.. ﻿So it seems. ﻿Come this way. ﻿See that up there? ﻿That's the watermark from the tsunami 9 years ago. ﻿So... What did you do? ﻿Mr. Kushitani didn't tell you? ﻿He just told me to look after you. ﻿He's a parole officer who goes the extra mile... ﻿Do you need to know... ? ﻿Some of them have history, too. ﻿And they're all hard workers. ﻿I was In prison for arson. ﻿Why... ? ﻿Because they let us down... ﻿Don't back out now, Mr. Sakamaki. ﻿Trade is kind of slow right now... ﻿I understand things are hard ﻿but you took on other guys I brought in. ﻿To be honest, I draw the line at arsonists and murderers. ﻿I'm Hasuda, Central Precinct. ﻿I'm Tomashino. ﻿A neighbor reported a steal. ﻿The offender knows his way around. ﻿This is ideal for hiding someone. ﻿I guess he knew the building is been empty for 2 years. ﻿You got here fast. ﻿The corners aren't transparent. ﻿I'd say that he's been dead a week. ﻿- External injuries? - No. ﻿There are no visible signs of trauma to the head nor neck. ﻿Don't contaminate the scene. ﻿The victim's driver's license and business card ﻿were found! ﻿Run a check. ﻿Yes, Sir. ﻿Don't touch him. ﻿We still have to examine him.. ﻿No! ﻿Thank you. ﻿So he last contacted you on April 27? ﻿Yes, he was always home by 10 pm but not that day... ﻿Was my husband killed? ﻿Would anyone want him killed? ﻿Did he have any enemies, Mrs. Mikumo? ﻿No. ﻿My husband was ﻿almost too kind, In my opinion. ﻿After the earthquake ﻿he went out on his own to fix the fallen tombstones. ﻿Even the abandoned ones! ﻿When I was unwell, he suggested we move to Sendai. ﻿He had to retake the exam in order to work here. ﻿He was kind and never envious or resentful... ﻿Mikumo was the ideal welfare officer. ﻿- Can we borrow this ? - Go ahead. ﻿Talk to Mikumo's colleague. ﻿Ms. Maruyama! ﻿Yes ﻿She might be able to help. ﻿- Use the meeting room. -OK. ﻿Please sit. ﻿Your name... ﻿Mikiko. ﻿So Mikumo assessed the applications ? ﻿Could he abuse his authority as a supervisor ? ﻿No. ﻿The Director signed the evaluations, ﻿not Mikumo. ﻿Maybe he upset people who he turned down? ﻿His role in assessing applications wasnt known. ﻿Besides... ﻿these people wouldnt retaliate. ﻿How do you mean? ﻿They're busy ﻿trying to survive. ﻿You need to submit a medical certificate. ﻿I do? ﻿From the hospital, to verify your situation. ﻿They prefer not to depend on the government. ﻿Many are like that. ﻿- They might... - Enough. ﻿I heard that Mikumo was a good man. ﻿Yes. ﻿The victim is Tadakatsu Mikumo, 41. ﻿From the post-mortem report and forensic evidence ﻿we know he was abducted 2 weeks earlier. ﻿A few days into his abduction he began dehydrating ﻿and about a week later he died of hunger. ﻿Forensics have the details. ﻿There's no sign that the tape on his mouth had been reapplied. ﻿This shows how he was positioned. ﻿The apartment house is located in Wakaba ward ﻿In an undeveloped area. ﻿There are no security cameras in the vicinity. ﻿Ask around the neighborhood ﻿and find out what you can. ﻿And keep in mind that the victim was a welfare officer. ﻿Dismissed. ﻿Yes, Sir. ﻿Don't you approve of my methods? ﻿Sorry? ﻿He was left to starve ﻿and his money wasn't stolen. ﻿It must be a grudge killing. ﻿What are you, the commander ? ﻿The rumor is true. ﻿You never get promoted and you're a loner. ﻿That's how I like it. ﻿What a pain in the ass...! ﻿Laundry Room ﻿Washing machines out of order ﻿Help me ﻿First, ﻿write down the names of missing people ﻿over here. ﻿That building there Is not to be entered. ﻿Write the names, a description ﻿of the missing person and address. ﻿We'll contact you if we find a match. ﻿This kid's mom is missing! ﻿Let me see if my sister's in there! ﻿You can't yet. ﻿The police will check the lists and call you. ﻿I lost my phone in the tsunami ﻿I beg you! We came all the way here! ﻿We can't go home with nothing. ﻿I'm sorry. Tone-kun ﻿You're under your boss's care now. Keep it up! ﻿It's a sofa bed. ﻿You can sleep here. ﻿‘Til you find a place. ﻿The bread is here. ﻿Pick up your ration. ﻿Take one. ﻿What do you think you're doing? ﻿Get to the end of the line! ﻿What's that? ﻿Son of a bitch! ﻿You jerk! ﻿Lay off, asshole! ﻿Lay off! ﻿Get off me! ﻿This is from Kei. ﻿Come on, stop looking so grumpy. ﻿I told you, no one held a grudge against Mikumo. We just want a look. ﻿sorry? ﻿I need to... ﻿verify it for myself. ﻿I need to see it to believe it. ﻿Okay. ﻿Does "seeing it" help you understand ? ﻿What's that? ﻿I was at college in 2011. ﻿I was In Tokyo so I'll never know how bad it was here. ﻿But I dislike people who have to "see to believe.” ﻿Oh God, it's him... ﻿Dad, it's me, Miyu! ﻿It's my wife. ﻿There's no doubt. ﻿She was holding this watch. ﻿She probably got pulled out to sea and drifted back ﻿to the beach where she was found. ﻿The watch... belongs to my son. ﻿Give him back! ﻿Give him back to me! ﻿Poor kid... Her mother is dead. ﻿Thank you so much. ﻿Did they find your, mother ? ﻿They found... ﻿my wife, too. ﻿That's good... ﻿I don't know. ﻿Is it good? My son... ﻿He hasn't been found yet. ﻿He was wearing a yellow jacket like yours. ﻿Mom told me to wear it when we evacuated. ﻿It's my last memory of her. ﻿I came to see you, Ms. Tokashiki because ﻿of an anonymous phone call. ﻿Come in. ﻿Thank you. ﻿So... ﻿I was informed that you are working as a Cashier. ﻿It's only temporary. ﻿At Sakurai Supermarket. ﻿I checked your timecard. ﻿You've been working full-time for 4 months. ﻿You get 128,000 yen a month. ﻿You know what ? ﻿Cacao helps you relax. ﻿If you don't mind... ﻿Let me remind you, Ms. Tokashiki. ﻿If your income exceeds your welfare allowance ﻿you'll have to return it. ﻿Wait a minute.. ﻿If you don't say anything, no one will know. ﻿You're on benefits because you're too Sick to work... ﻿That's not fair! ﻿How about my kid, with her depressed welfare mom ? ﻿She needs to study! ﻿I need money for school lunches and school trips... ﻿I can pay for that because of your benefits. ﻿But ﻿kids at school found out that I'm on welfare. ﻿So my daughter ﻿got bullied. ﻿That's why I wanted her to go to cram school instead... ﻿If I'm on welfare ﻿do I have to give up those options? ﻿It's not my car. ﻿- A friend parks it here. - Can I see the registration? ﻿It was a gift. ﻿You could get good money for it. ﻿This car's a luxury not a necessity. ﻿You bitch! ﻿Stop that! ﻿Who, are you? ﻿A police officer. ﻿Tricky bitch... ﻿Your hand seems OK. ﻿If you're able to work you should. ﻿Look for a job ﻿so that you can be financially independent. ﻿Or return the payments for your invalid claim. ﻿Let me tell you ﻿the money you defrauded from us ﻿should go to the needy! ﻿That's enough for today. ﻿Why did you stop me? I wasn't finished. ﻿You only confronted him because we were there. ﻿Yes. I used you. ﻿Hey... ﻿After the disaster ﻿many disadvantaged people moved to Sendai city. We can't ignore frauds ﻿when people are desperate. ﻿The earthquake... ﻿changed everything. ﻿I know it did. ﻿No, you don't, ﻿sergeant! ﻿A welfare officer named Tadakatsu Mikumo was found dead. ﻿This is it! ﻿Yes, all those police cars. ﻿They were investigating. ﻿- You'll be arrested! - Why me? ﻿I think you did it. Not me. ﻿How about you? ﻿“The neighbors noticed a stench and called the police.” ﻿“The responding officers found me” ﻿“Mikumo in the apartment, tied in duct tape.” ﻿"The police speculate that he was abducted" ﻿Over there. ﻿I'd say he died a week ago. ﻿No neck trauma... ﻿It resembles the Mikumo case. ﻿It's too early to know. ﻿Call the hospital to prepare for an autopsy. ﻿Yes, Sir. ﻿The victim is Takeru Jonouchi, ﻿the Social Welfare Vice Chair. ﻿He wasnt involved in any scandals ﻿and he was known as a man of Integrity. ﻿Any footprints ? ﻿We found prints near the crime scene. ﻿They had no tread pattern, like slippers. ﻿Similar ones were at the Mikumo crime scene. ﻿The first body was in Wakaba but this was in Rifu town. ﻿They're 30 km apart so look for links. ﻿The victims had worked together ﻿as welfare officers In the same office. ﻿as welfare officers in the same office. ﻿We're assuming it was a grudge killing. ﻿Yes, Sir. ﻿When did Mikumo and Jonouchi work here? ﻿Jonouchi was the Director from 2014 to 2017 ﻿Mikumo worked here from 2014 to 2017 ﻿Follow me. ﻿Mikumo dealt with applicants ? ﻿Yes, he was also a caseworker. ﻿How many cases were rejected while they were here? ﻿I'll have to go through the old files... ﻿They're digitally archived? ﻿The applications are handwritten. ﻿Good. Show me every one of them. ﻿We'll need a written request. We have our procedures ﻿I see. Can I use your phone? ﻿Who are you calling? ﻿The prefectural police. ﻿Just call ﻿the Chief of Prefectural Police! ﻿Officials hate officials with more power. ﻿We're the same. ﻿l didn't plan to be a small-town cop. ﻿Too bad you failed the Tokyo Metropolitan Police exam! ﻿Competition was tough. ﻿Prove your worth then! ﻿Give me a hand, boys! ﻿Yes, Sir. ﻿Look for applicants who might be resentful. ﻿Processed ﻿I don't know why my application was rejected. ﻿My only guess is that ﻿they never intended to give me benefits all along. ﻿I see ﻿What was-the name of the officer ? ﻿The one named Mikumo. ﻿I can't tell if he was good or bad. ﻿He's slippery and kind of detached. ﻿He's good at pretending to listen. ﻿And you were rejected? ﻿Yes ﻿That's why I'm here. ﻿Mrs. Sasaki ﻿you have to come to the office with me. ﻿You need to fill out the application yourself. ﻿I don't know. I wouldn't want to be a bother to anyone. ﻿That's wrong! ﻿Your generation is always afraid of being a nuisance ﻿but you're not. ﻿You're entitled to ﻿minimum living standards under the constitution. ﻿And the government is here to support that. ﻿And the government Is here to support that. ﻿You can ask for help. ﻿You have to ask for help. ﻿Mrs. Sasaki. ﻿I'll come with you. ﻿OK? ﻿They said he was good! ﻿A man of integrity, he’s not! ﻿The welfare system is corrupt! ﻿You've gone too far. ﻿It has to be a voluntary act... ﻿You can't force her. ﻿Mrs. Sasaki really needs welfare benefits. ﻿Start from the beginning. ﻿Do you think our work's worthwhile? ﻿It is. ﻿Of course. ﻿Shelter rules ﻿Are you OK? ﻿My uncle... ﻿went to Fukushima. ﻿Fukushima ? ﻿His daughter... ﻿my cousin... she's missing. ﻿He told me to wait here for him. ﻿You are all by yourself? ﻿Yes. ﻿Here. ﻿You can eat that. ﻿You can talk to me any time. ﻿Let's go to Kei's place. ﻿Come on! ﻿Hurry! ﻿Kei! ﻿Welcome home! ﻿Thank you! ﻿I'm home. Say "I'm home" ﻿What? ﻿Say "I’m home" ﻿I'm home. ﻿Welcome home! ﻿What's your name? ﻿Yasuhisa Tone. ﻿Tone. ﻿That's the first time I've seen you smile! ﻿You definitely look better when you smile. ﻿I know I'm not supposed to come home yet but ﻿I can't fit into those groups at the shelter. ﻿I can relax better at home. ﻿It's dangerous with the tremors... ﻿I used to be busy but ﻿Toshima Barber not anymore. ﻿not anymore. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Come and eat! ﻿Thank you for the meal. ﻿What work do you do, Tone? ﻿Seafood processing. ﻿That means.. ﻿Yes, it was wiped out. And my apartment... ﻿Just like my house... ﻿How about your friends? ﻿I don't have any. ﻿Smile. ﻿If you smile ﻿everyone will be nice to you. ﻿I'll go back. ﻿Just stay tonight. ﻿It's late. ﻿There're no futons. ﻿Kan-chan can sleep in my futon ﻿and you take my husband's old one. ﻿Just tonight, Yasuhisa. Just tonight. ﻿Kei, can I come here again tomorrow ? ﻿Sleep. ﻿It's bedtime. ﻿I always used to stay up... ﻿I stayed awake, to wait for mom to come home. ﻿When she came home I could smell her perfume. ﻿So I knew right away. ﻿But when she hugged me ﻿she smelled of cigarettes and alcohol. ﻿So I told her to go away. ﻿I shouldn't have. ﻿Because she'll never come home now. ﻿I don't know who to be angry with. ﻿Can I tell you about me? ﻿I was out doing my weekly shopping as usual ﻿when it came up to me... ﻿It was so close. The tsunami, I mean. ﻿Then out of nowhere, I got a burst of energy. ﻿I have trouble with my knees ﻿but I put all my effort into climbing the hill. ﻿My life is hardly ideal but I survived. ﻿To be alone here. ﻿Why did I survive? ﻿But then it occurred to me now. ﻿It was good...! ﻿I'm glad I'm alive. ﻿So that I can ﻿hug you like this! ﻿Give me a break. ﻿Who wants to listen to that! ﻿Tone? ﻿What's up? ﻿Is it OK.. ﻿that I lived ? ﻿Of course it is! ﻿Smile. ﻿Try to smile. ﻿Tone. ﻿Hamakaze Bed and Breakfast Are you looking for something? ﻿Uh... ﻿There was a girl named Kan-chan... ﻿I think she lived here. Is she around ? ﻿And you are... ? ﻿We used to know each other. ﻿How? ﻿We were in the same shelter after the earthquake. ﻿I see... ﻿You must have had a hard time, too. ﻿Kan-chan.. ﻿Was she happy here? ﻿I like to think so ﻿Just wait a minute... ﻿Hello? ﻿Someone is here, looking for her. ﻿Just now. ﻿They were in the same shelter. ﻿A man. He appears to be about 30... ﻿Do I have to? ﻿Yes! To make a good impression! ﻿Utsunomiya Ironworks ﻿It's in Tochigi. It's so far away. ﻿That's what it takes to get a job these days. ﻿I'll be right back. ﻿Work is a priority. ﻿ e have to make a living. ﻿See you later! ﻿See you. ﻿See you later! ﻿I'm writing about the 10th anniversary ﻿of the devastating tsunami. ﻿I'm looking for a girl named Kan-chan who lived in a shelter. ﻿It's a follow-up on her life. ﻿Yes. ﻿I'll get her permission. ﻿Rifu Orphanage ﻿Wakaba Ward ﻿There were upset applicants! ﻿There were cases. ﻿You hid them. ﻿Sorry... Can I have a word? ﻿Misleading officers is a crime... ﻿It was the Director. ﻿Kozuka... and Kubota. ﻿Kozuka, the man with the knife, died. ﻿Kubota moved away. ﻿Who is this? ﻿Kei Toshima was... an old woman. ﻿She ﻿knew this arsonist. ﻿The arsonist's name isn't here. ﻿Do you know his name? ﻿Yasuhisa Tone. ﻿In the Wakaba area ﻿a suspected serial killer is at large. ﻿He was on Wakaba Street in a black coat with a hood. ﻿A clerk we'd talked to called us. ﻿Got it. ﻿Officer Hasuda ﻿uproored hidden evidence. ﻿Yasuhisa Tone is our prime suspect! ﻿Find him! Yes, sir! ﻿Stop! ﻿Tone! ﻿Freeze! ﻿Stop! ﻿Damn...! ﻿See you tomorrow. ﻿I was looking for you. ﻿Why...? ﻿I thought you had 2 more years... ﻿I got good behavior. ﻿You know ﻿I‘ve made a new life for myself. ﻿Why do you work in welfare? ﻿Is that your way to... ﻿I want to save them. ﻿You might think it’s too late but ﻿it's not. ﻿It's pointless. ﻿They cant be saved. ﻿That's where youre wrong. ﻿Yasuthisa! ﻿I knew it was you! Where have you been? ﻿What ? ﻿The high school uniform... ﻿You look ﻿like a girl. ﻿You're sexualizing me. ﻿No, I'm not sexualizing you. ﻿Welcome home, Yasuhisa. ﻿Yes, I'm home. ﻿Kei! ﻿Kei. ﻿Kei? ﻿Welcome home. ﻿Don't get up. ﻿You bought so many groceries! ﻿For the neighbors? ﻿No one lives here.

Eat this. ﻿You eat it. ﻿Never mind me’1 ﻿I'm not hungry. ﻿You must be! ﻿Do you get a pension? ﻿I couldn't afford the payments. ﻿How's island life, Kan-chan? ﻿Worry about yourself! ﻿People worry about others, not themselves. ﻿You haven't been eating. ﻿It's OK. It is not! ﻿There is social welfare. ﻿Apply for it. ﻿No matter how difficult life gets ﻿I don't want to depend on the government. ﻿Stop that! ﻿You'll starve! ﻿This is not ﻿a stranger's business. ﻿That's ridiculous. ﻿Who's a stranger? ﻿Don't be stupid! ﻿Kan-chan and I.. ﻿We don't want you to die! You have to live! ﻿We see you as our real mother. ﻿Don't you know that ? ﻿Okay. ﻿I'll do it. ﻿The utilities were shut off... ﻿I see ﻿Let me check if an Interview room is available. ﻿Sorry but ﻿your circumstances don't meet with our criteria. ﻿You want a job in the food trade ﻿but you need to be open to other jobs. ﻿Youre 39 and healthy! You'll get work. ﻿What's your relationship with the applicant ? ﻿We're just friends. ﻿Can't you support her ? ﻿Community is the best way to reduce poverty. ﻿Neighbors can provide a lot more than we can. ﻿Ma'am. ﻿There is disaster assistance. ﻿You can apply for it if your house is damaged. ﻿My house is OK Good. ﻿A room is available. ﻿Are you related to her? ﻿No. ﻿Where's the application? ﻿The applicant has to ask for it. ﻿Kei, ask for it. ﻿Kei. ﻿Social welfare... ﻿I want to apply for it. ﻿OK, let's give it a try. ﻿OK, Kamisaki? ﻿Can you come to the interview room please? ﻿Process this. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I've always taken care of myself. ﻿You've done a great job of that, Kei. ﻿Think of this as your reward. ﻿OK? ﻿"I took Kei Toshima to the Social Welfare office ﻿to help with her welfare application." ﻿"It was approved but it caused me to commit a crime. ﻿Who interviewed her ? ﻿Takehiro Kamisaki. ﻿Kamisaki.. ﻿The congressman ﻿Yes, he's popular for his liberal views. ﻿Tone grew up here. ﻿From what age? ﻿Since his birth. ﻿He was found in a public toilet with his umbilical cord attached. ﻿Somehow he got wind of that information. ﻿It traumatized him and ﻿as aresult, he hears sounds in his head. ﻿The noise of gushing water. ﻿You mean the young man? ﻿After the earthquake, I was so preoccupied ﻿I was preoccupied ﻿There was him, a little girl and an old lady. ﻿There was him, a little girl and an old lady. ﻿It was an unusual combination. ﻿They'd be in a corner of the room... ﻿They seeme'd to have a closer bond than the other evacuees. ﻿They were at the shelter ? ﻿They called the girl Kan-chan. ﻿Sometimes I still think about them. ﻿The three of them, together like areal family. ﻿See? The posters are up! ﻿Guys, meet Kamisaki. Hello! ﻿Thank you, everyone. ﻿You like my office? Sure do. ﻿And the location... ﻿Kei's dead. ﻿Kei Toshima ﻿died! ﻿Of starvation! ﻿So I heard. I'm terribly sorry. ﻿What did you do to her? ﻿She qualified for assistance! ﻿She cancelled it herself. ﻿- She wouldn't do that. - But she did! ﻿She did it herself. ﻿Bullshit! ﻿Kei wouldn't do such a thing! ﻿Our policy is to respect the applicant's will. We simply adhered, to it. ﻿Let me go, please. ﻿Director.. ﻿In 2013 ﻿the social welfare act was revised and enacted in 2014. ﻿Since then the application process became tougher. ﻿Only 1% of Japanese people are on welfare. ﻿US and Europe where it's 5 to 10%. ﻿The United Nations advised our government ﻿to provide more social welfare. ﻿That's the country we live in. ﻿But I'm wasting my words on you. ﻿The people who died in the disaster were victims ﻿and you made your choices. ﻿Think about the reasons behind it ﻿and stop blaming others. ﻿We all want to die with dignity. ﻿Surrounded by loved ones. ﻿These days, that's a luxury. ﻿We all die alone. ﻿Poverty Behind Family Tragedy? ﻿Attempted Murder-Suicide ﻿Are you related. ﻿I'm Ms. Tokashiki's welfare officer. ﻿They’re OK. ﻿But you cant ﻿see her or her daughter yet. ﻿I was waiting for you ﻿so I could ask you some questions. ﻿I heard you lost your mother In the tsunami. ﻿Who told you that? ﻿You, were at the orphanage and ﻿you were adopted. ﻿was just one of many. ﻿But you, Ms. Maruyama ﻿turned your bad luck around and help the destitute. ﻿I can't help them all. ﻿Like Ms. Tokashiki. ﻿I heard you met two persons in the shelter. ﻿Kei Toshima ﻿and ﻿Yasuhisa Tone. ﻿Is that right ? ﻿Mikiko Maruyama. ﻿You were called Kan because Mikiko ﻿also reads Kan. ﻿Not anymore. ﻿Do you know where I can find Tone? ﻿No. Wo haven't been in touch. ﻿What went on with you three in the shelter ? ﻿Am I wrong when I say Tone wanted revenge for Kei Toshima? ﻿Yasuhisa is... ﻿Tone is.. ﻿He can't express his emotions but ﻿deep down he's kind. ﻿That's the Yasuhisa Tone I know. ﻿How can you stay so strong? ﻿Well... ﻿I just wondered. ﻿You have to ask for help. ﻿If you do ﻿someone will respond. ﻿There's still hope. ﻿Someone ﻿will reach out to you. ﻿Oh my God, It’s over... ﻿It's too late! ﻿Can we proceed? ﻿Congressman, it's time. ﻿There's quite a turnout. Are you nervous? ﻿Social welfare in this country is a serious problem. ﻿It's not just politics, it's about worsening poverty. ﻿Poverty must be tackled by every one of us. ﻿A life of poverty means ﻿not knowing when you'll eat or where you'll sleep. ﻿You lose hope living like that. ﻿It's a lifestyle that wears you down. ﻿I've seen many people's lives being ruined by it. ﻿Unfortunately ﻿it could happen to any of us ﻿Will Tone come? ﻿Be quiet. ﻿Kamisaki had protection since yesterday. ﻿Maybe there's a risk of him being abducted. ﻿But not here. ﻿Abduction isn't the only threat. ﻿It's time ﻿to take a stance and say, “No more poverty!” ﻿Hey! ﻿Kamisaki. ﻿Listen to me. ﻿- Kamisaki! - Halt! ﻿Yasuhisa Tone! ﻿Drive! ﻿Kamisaki! ﻿- Kamisaki! - Shut up. ﻿Arrest him! ﻿For interference at 3:41 pm. We've got you. ﻿Tone confessed so isn't the case closed ? ﻿Sergeant! ﻿What did you do ﻿after Mikumo's body was found? ﻿I knew the police were moving in. ﻿So I hid in internet cafes until I got Jonouchi. ﻿When does Kamisaki leave Sendai ? ﻿Bring him to me now. ﻿If not ﻿disclose what he did. ﻿And make him publicly apologize. ﻿Do you know this man? ﻿"Yasuhisa Tone was arrested for” ﻿attempted assault. The 31-year-old works at a local plant.” ﻿They arrested the killer. ﻿“Tone is a suspect in the death” ﻿"who was found on May 17 and” * ﻿"Takeru Jonouch! who was found dead" ﻿"on May 26.” ﻿“Tone is still being questioned" ﻿He's hiding something. ﻿Slow down. We're yet to confirm what he told us. ﻿Let me try as a cross-jurisdictional investigator. ﻿No. That'd violate police regulations. ﻿The police system is so rigid! ﻿Wait! ﻿Where are you going? ﻿To find something to make him talk. ﻿His public appearance tomorrow is a worry. ﻿But the elections are soon. ﻿I've known him since high school! so I let him use this space. ﻿He's a good friend. ﻿Ill be downstairs. ﻿Tone wants you to make a public apology. ﻿About Kei Toshima? ﻿Why did she back out? ﻿Sit down. ﻿Maybe the stigma of being on welfare bothered her. ﻿It's hard to believe that was an issue. ﻿She was very close to people she met at the shelter. ﻿They gave her the will to live. ﻿Kei Toshima ﻿had a daughter. ﻿In our background check We learned that before she married a barber,she had a baby. ﻿Her first husband was violent so she left him. ﻿When she remarried she had to adopt out her child. ﻿I suggested that her daughter might care for her. ﻿My daughter ﻿wouldn't know who I am. ﻿She thinks her adoptive parents are her parents. ﻿Just for money... ﻿I wouldn't want her ﻿to know my situation. ﻿Calm down. ﻿If you don't want to contact her... ﻿Mrs. Toshima. ﻿If you don't need the benefits ﻿you can cancel it. ﻿"Kei Toshima’ ﻿“hereby cancel..." ﻿But you knew her situation. ﻿you knew she'd have a hard time without welfare. ﻿I knew but at that time ﻿I couldn't think straight. ﻿Why not ? ﻿Because... ﻿we were all exhausted... ﻿Mikumo used to say ﻿after the earthquake ﻿that we couldn't save everyone. ﻿I lost my family in the earthquake so ﻿I understood his position. ﻿With the evacuees and the piles of extra work... ﻿The government merit pressured us to make cutbacks ﻿and there were cases of welfare fraud. ﻿That's when Mikumo made a specific decision ﻿to stick to the rules. ﻿That way ﻿we could save more people In the long run. ﻿That's what he believed. ﻿You put Jonouchi ﻿In a deserted chicken farm to conceal the stench. ﻿Again, you were careful ﻿not to leave identifiable footprints. ﻿Now I'll verify your account. ﻿Why did you kill that order? ﻿It's over! ﻿- What a long class! - Time for home. ﻿Bye, kids! ﻿Excuse me, ma'am! ﻿My mother... ﻿My adoptive parents told me that she died when I was little. ﻿I see. ﻿Is there a problem? ﻿No. I guess we misunderstood some information. ﻿Sorry to take up your time. ﻿Sergeant... ? ﻿Please... ﻿Yes...? ﻿The kids you teach from now... ﻿I hope they're brave ﻿and kind children. ﻿Please bring them up so they'll be like that. ﻿ENGLISH CAMP ﻿Let me talk to Tone. ﻿I need to talk to him! ﻿Inspector! ﻿Please let him. ﻿I'm Tomashino. ﻿This is Hasuda. ﻿I told the other guy everything. ﻿Do you know why Kei Toshima withdrew her application? ﻿Because... ﻿that's what they wanted from the beginning. ﻿That's not all. ﻿She had a daughter. ﻿That's one reason why. ﻿She blamed herself for giving her up. ﻿If she reached out ﻿her daughter's life would be turned upside down. ﻿In the end Kei never met her daughter. ﻿But she had the two of you instead. ﻿The time she spent with you and Kan-chan ﻿was like making a new family. ﻿You gave her a moment of happiness. ﻿If that's true ﻿she could've lived for us. ﻿She chose to die instead. ﻿The assholes knew... ﻿but they let her Starve herself to death! ﻿They could've looked after her. ﻿Is that you, Miyahara? ﻿Kamisaki is missing? ﻿It might be related to yesterday's incident. ﻿The higher-ups are concerned... ﻿You wanted someone to see Kamisaki apologize. ﻿You hoped to change that person's mind. ﻿Kamisaki is missing. ﻿Sit down! ﻿I have to go! ﻿Did you take the rap for someone else? ﻿Where is he? ﻿Let's go! ﻿You'll be suspended for doing this. ﻿Keep me out of this. ﻿Hazardous, Keep Out ﻿It's so rundown... ﻿Anyone there? ﻿It's the police! ﻿Stay away! ﻿Or else ﻿I'll kill Kamisaki. ﻿Kan-chan! ﻿It's me. ﻿It's Yasuhisa. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Say something. I'll finish.. ﻿what I started. ﻿Don't do it, Kan-chan. ﻿It's OK, Yasuhisa! ﻿I'll take responsibility for what I've done! ﻿Contact HQ and ask for backup. ﻿OK. ﻿Hey. ﻿I can get her to talk. ﻿OK. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Let's stop. ﻿It's too late. ﻿It never is. ﻿Come to me. ﻿Earthquakes and tsunamis... ﻿are monsters. ﻿We have no chance against them. ﻿They break in, ﻿destroy everything ﻿and take many lives, ﻿And Mom. ﻿I didn't know who to hate. ﻿But that's not why Kei died. ﻿That was caused by people! ﻿We're all responsible for her death! ﻿I know how you feel, Kan-chan. ﻿But we should stop. ﻿Don't kill Kamisaki. ﻿Please. ﻿Come to me. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Don't. ﻿Please don't. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Oh my God, it’s over... ﻿It's too late... ﻿You are wrong! ﻿Oh my God, it's over... ﻿It's too late! ﻿Listen, Maruyama. ﻿His family died in the tsunami ﻿so he wants to make changes. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿After Kei passed away ﻿did you ever come here? ﻿You see the sliding door ? ﻿On the door ﻿she wrote a message to you. ﻿She must have used her last bit of energy to write it. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Call an ambulance. ﻿Welcome home. ﻿Welcome home. ﻿Kan-chan. ﻿Are you clear ? ﻿Turn around. ﻿Inspector! ﻿This way. ﻿We'll put you in the ambulance. ﻿Ready, 1,2 and 3. ﻿Sergeant Tomashino. ﻿Maruyama posted this ﻿before she abducted Kamisaki. ﻿I'm Mikiko Maruyama. I work for Wakaba's Welfare Service. ﻿I have decided to quit for personal reasons. ﻿I'd like to share my thoughts with the other officers. ﻿I know you are devoted and responsible. ﻿Except for an unethical 1 ﻿But own job requires more than devotion. ﻿Because social welfare is ﻿the last and only safety net. ﻿You have to do more! ﻿You have to reinterpret our instructions sometimes ﻿If you want to save lives. ﻿If you blame applicants for their troubles ﻿you must accept the consequences. ﻿Me too. ﻿I will be accountable for the things I do now. ﻿One more thing. ﻿Those who need saving... ﻿Please ask for help. ﻿When you stfut yourself off ﻿you feel so alone in the world. ﻿But that’s wrong. ﻿The world is bigger than you think. ﻿here is always someone who cares for you. ﻿I know because I was saved by those people. ﻿You aren't alone even if you think you are. ﻿Try again. ﻿Pluck up the courage to ask for help. ﻿Be louder than the unethical officers. ﻿You have nothing to be ashamed of. ﻿What she did is not excusable by any means ﻿but she presented some questions that I need to think about. ﻿Her actions cast a light On a mistake I made. ﻿Accept my apology. ﻿Mr. Kamisaki. ﻿What's your relation to the case? ﻿No one can stop me. ﻿Everyone deserves ﻿to live. ﻿Just 5 minutes. He violated his parole. ﻿Come with me. ﻿Over there. ﻿My wife's body was found. ﻿My son is still missing. ﻿I failed to save them. ﻿But you ﻿tried to save Kan-chan. ﻿No. ﻿I didn't. ﻿I failed. ﻿On that day ﻿a boy was drowning before my eyes. ﻿I wanted to help but... ﻿I was afraid of the water. ﻿I just watched. ﻿I watched him sink, in his yellow jacket... ﻿I couldn't dive in. ﻿I left him to die.. ﻿So when I saw Kan-@han in the yellow jacket ﻿I vowed to protect her. ﻿I vowed never to leave her. ﻿Thank you. ﻿You tried to save everyone. ﻿And for telling me... ﻿Thank you. Good Morning, My son.
