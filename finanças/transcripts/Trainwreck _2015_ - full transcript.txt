Previously in Once Upon A Time Gold... he says there's a way to stop Cora where he was locked up. David ! He's in a enchanted sleep. Now he's trapped. We destroyed the wardrobe Cora brought the ashes together She's going to use them to open a portal There is a magic compass. Cora is looking for it. The compass is yours. Why are you doing this to me now ? You took a heart, Now you have a princess - Cora didn't see me escaping. - How did you escape ? Hook, he said that if you? trusted him Maybe you could stop Cora together Can we go to Storybrooke ? For this we need the compass Stop ! Food for prisoners It's not time. Who are you ? Identify yourself slave ! Slave ? I prefer Captain You must be Belle The Queen sent you here, right ? She wants to kill me. I'm not here to kill you, Love - But to rescue you. - rescue me ? Who are you ? A friend We don't have much time Your father's life is in danger He has been attacked by the same monster who took you away from your family Rumplestiltskin? He must be stopped ! You have spend more time with him than anyone else There is a room with a magical weapon that has the power to kill him No, no let me talk to him He is not a monster. Belle, your father's life hangs in the balance I must find the weapon to save him no, I don't know what you're talking about and I don't know how to kill Rumpelstilskin - you don't? - no, and why would I? So, I'm afraid I can't save you So pretty and so useless No . not useless She's a valuable chess piece Do I look like a chess player? - My Hook, if you please. - No. The asking was me being a gentleman. even a pirate should have better manners than that. I know who you are... ...Captain. I know why you came here from Neverland. And I know all about the crocodile you wish to skin. Then you also know that I'll stop at nothing. So dedicated, and resourceful. No one has been able to fight their way past my defenses before. She can't help you to kill Rumpelstiltskin, Hook But I can. If you do something for me. Wll you join me for a drink? Things are about to change in this world. Radically. I have plans to enact a curse... ...that will take everyone to a far off land. How will that help me? This new world... ...it's a land without magic... ...where the Dark one will be stripped of his powers. There, you won't need any magical weapon to kill him. You can do it. Tell me what I have to do. There's one person I don't want following me to this new land. You're to see to it that doesn't happen. An assassination. Who is it you want me to dispose of? My Mother. The Queen of Hearts. - Any change? - No He's not getting better. He needs a true love kiss. only Mary Margaret can wake him up Until? Well, that's rather optimistic, isn't it? What are you talking about ? They're up against your mother. The only chance Snow and Emma have of defeating her is with the squid ink. Which would be beneficial if we knew that message was delivered. But alas, given the prince's condition, we don't know. It could be Cora. Exactly. And what if we're wrong ? well, you'd become the only mother of our son magic is unpredictable here No, I cannot lie to him. Including your son If you really want to be a mother better for Henry, protect it, If you want to be better... Prove it to me ! Rumplestilskin's cell ! I didn't come here since Regina's curse. He told us here that you would become "The Savior" He knew? It was prophesied. Come on The squid ink ... Not here. Gold said that we have to find it. Was there someone else with him? Could they have taken it? No, he was locked alone. Visitors were forbidden, too dangerous for any human contact. He could have gone crazy. But he was not. How much do we need? What does that mean? He was obsessed by you You were the key for the curse We've been looking everywhere, No trace of the ink It must be there, he told David so You've been looking everywhere Maybe there is something on the label no, she's right - Did you find it? - In a certain way There was paint in this cell Fuck What are you doing , Aurora? She's helping me No . Non, Don't waste your energy dear Rumplestiltskin himself couldn't escape from this cell Thank you Aurora, We couldn't have done it without you - How did you? - How could you? - No, don't blame her She was just doing what I told her to - You took her heart - The truth, It is me ! It was a gift Excuse us, We would love to stay But Storybrooke is waiting for us Hook Wait Please don't do that My son is in Storybrooke and he needs me Maybe you should have consider that when you left me on that bean You would have done the same thing In reality, no Do you know what it is Emma? The bean from the giant guardian Yes it is A pirate always keeps a souvenir from his conquests but this... is much more than that, it's a symbol something that was once magic, full of hope, and possibilities look at it now dry, dead and useless just like you time of bargain is done just like I am with you Leroy Did something happen to him ? Is it an emergency ? Leroy They're gone They're all gone Yeah, She believed in it, to gain salvation, It was their... Where are they? Regina and Gold? What is going on? All the magic from the mines is gone Stolen? A vicious took everything No one steals from a dwarf Except the Queen and Rumplestiltskin If they don't help Emma and Mary Margaret It means that my mom lied to me I'm sorry Henry We have to find her, We must stop them We have to help Emma and Mary Margaret We are trapped Emma This cell is enchanted to lock Rumplestiltskin We don't have any chance - It's my fault - No, it's mine Cora stole you heart because I didn't protect you It's really nice but I think that it's my fault I'm supposed to be "The Savior" and I didn't save anything... On peut gagner ce combat, tu le sais ?a ? Le bien triomphe toujours. C'est se que dis Henry Je suppose que cet optimisme est de famille Je pense que sa a sauter une g?n?ration Tu devrais le savoir mieux que quiconque Tu as briser la mal?diction Et depuis, quoi ? We landed here, I burnt the wardrobe Cora got the ashes, and now the compass The reason why I broke the curse It's because Gold wanted me to do that I have nothing to do with that - What are you talking about? - He told you that I was "The Savior", it was his plan That I play this part Maybe was I fated to do it At Nostos lake . We are going through the worlds Maybe I am just a simple pirate but I know one thing Lakes have water After all that we've lived Why do you still have doubts about me ? I told him everything I know Honor ... To kill me ... She should have killed me herself You will help me. It has to be your choice. No ! Emma ! Regina ! Henry ! David ! Thank you . Seriously Cora, after all this time... I was right! You really changed... Thank you. Emma. Emma. It seems that we should update this subject. You have no idea. Do you want to eat something at Granny's? It's on me. Boy, are you hungry? I will see you later. Congratulations! You just gathered the mother and the child. Maybe one day, they'll invite you for dinner. I'll see you later. Storybrooke. Please rate this subtitle at %url% Help other users to choose the best subtitles
