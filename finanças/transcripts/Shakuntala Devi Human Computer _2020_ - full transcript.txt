Ma. It's usually the first word we speak. A word that's impossible to define... Because no other words can do it justice. Mothers are considered greater than God. They're synonymous with sacrifice. But my mother isn't like that. Today, I'm doing what perhaps no daughter has done before. I'm filing a criminal case against my mother. There she is. Ms. Anupama Banerji... Ms. Shakuntala Devi's daughter. This is Mr Graham, the mediator. - Hello. - Hello. You okay? So, Ms. Banerji, you have accused Ms. Shakuntala Devi of illegally trying to destroy your financial standing. She is your mother, and a world-famous mathematician. Are world-famous mathematicians above the law? This could lead to a jail sentence for her. Are you absolutely certain you want to do this? Yes. Yes, I am. My mother tore me away from every person I ever loved. But not anymore. Even if it means going to war... Against the 'great' Shakuntala Devi. 16777216... So the first set is 216... Then 716. 2 x 2 = 4 4 x 2 = 8 256? - What did you say? - Your cube root. This? This is an eight digit number. And you're five years old! Shakuntala! How did you do it? It just comes to me naturally! Liar! I'm not a liar! Then explain how you did it! I can't explain it. I can only show you. Can you only do cube roots, or is there more up your sleeve? Give me sweets and I'll tell you! Forget sweets. I'll give you money. You can buy anything with it. Anything? Yes! Solve this. Uncle! Aunty! Look what Shakuntala did! Oh Lord. What did she do now? I was studying. I was calculating the cube root of an 8 digit number... And she gave the answer in a flash! It must have been a fluke... No, really! See for yourself. Solve this. I won't do it for free! Pay up. Okay, take this. And for the other one? She's more mercenary than the British empire! Here. Solve it now. 512, which is also the cube of 8. Now can I go buy my sweets? Uncle, she's no ordinary girl. She's a genius! Genie what? Ge-ni-us. A brilliant mind that's one in a million. Shakuntala, you're late for school! Shakuntala, you're late for school! Shaku, you're late for school! There she comes. This tiny girl - she's your mathematical genius? So who's going to give me math problems to solve? Teachers can ask too. Just a request. Ask difficult questions... Or she'll get bored. So, Math genius... I hope this question won't bore you? What are you doing? They come in my way. - Is that okay? - Yes. Come on. Shakuntala! Father, I want to go to school too. We are going, right? 3 pm, Naivediyam Public School. Father, not for Maths shows. To study like other kids. What can a school teach you? You'll end up teaching them. Come, let's go. Shakuntala, you need to practice. Get inside. I want to play with Sharda. You're booked for ten shows next week. Why must you make your father angry? Unlike you, I'm not scared of him! Is that how you talk about your father? He isn't my father. I'm his father! What are you saying? What do fathers in other homes do? They work, earn money and run the household. So who's the father in this house then? Shakuntala! Yes, I'll get her. Come along. I won't. Come on! What goes around comes around. Wait till your daughter gives you a hard time! Shaku, you aren't afraid of anyone, right? Mark my words. You'll be a big man someday. Why would I be a man? Because there's no such thing as a 'big woman'! In that case, I'll definitely be a big woman. And you'll always be by my side! "God-Promise"? God-Promise! Sharda! Sharda! Sharda, wake up! Why didn't you take Sharda to the hospital? It would have cost a lot of money. I do shows day and night. Where did all the money go? If we try to save the dying, we'll have nothing left for the living. Mother, I'm talking to you! Have you lost your voice? Why can't you speak up in front of Father? Shakuntala! I'll never forgive our mother, Sharda. I promise you - one day, I'll be a very big woman. And I won't be like our mother ever. God-promise. Miss Shakuntala! Here's your money for today's performance. In advance. Thanks. You can leave now. No, I'll stay. No, carry on. Take a rickshaw. And buy vegetables on the way. Don't be too late. Hello. Myself Shakuntala. Who is having first question for me? Arun, ask her a question! No, you guys go ahead. You cleared your CA exam in three months, man! Shoot! - No man... - Come on! Myself Arun. Hello Arun. So what's your question? I've been offered a job at a British Company. Congrats! The joining date is in April. I see. But I can't decide whether I should accept the job or not. Why? Well, their salary structure is a bit strange. On the first day, they'll pay me one paisa. On the second day, two paisas. On the third day, four paisas. And on the fourth day, eight paisas. Basically, the pay will be doubled every day. What do you think... Should I take up the job? I don't know if you listened carefully... But Arun said he's required to join in April... And April has 30 days. Wow, ma'am! You really are a genius. You know that April has 30 days! A round of applause for the lady! Arun, since you're joining a British Company should I give you the answer in Pounds or Rupees? Rupees will do, I guess. Okay. So your salary would be... I am correct? Arun, is she right? She is! So Arun, which company is this? Can ladies apply too? They looked like they had seen a ghost. Is it so weird to see a woman solve math problems? Well, women here usually only solve household problems. Right? That requires Maths too! No one can win against you, my love! Did you tell your mother about us? My love, we're going to Alam's estate to hunt pheasants. I'll talk to her as soon as we're back. I've been hearing this for a year now. "I'll tell her after my sister's engagement..." "After my grandmother's death anniversary..." "As soon as my father's back from Madras..." It's getting late. Let me drop you home. Okay? I'll be right back with the car keys... My love. Ms. Sukanya Gowthami weds Mr. Dheeraj Murthy Congratulations. My love, marriage in India is like a deal fixed by our parents. My love, nothing's going to change between us! Firstly, stop this 'my love' nonsense of yours! Shakuntala... My father went ahead and fixed me a match from within our caste. They're a family of money and repute. I make money too, Dheeraj. Exactly! You're very independent. I come from an ordinary family, Shakuntala... And you aren't ordinary in any way. Yeah Dheeraj, I'm not ordinary. You know what an ordinary girl would do in my place? My love! Lady! Care for some flowers? Come... This is Shakuntala Devi, from Bangalore. Hello. Please sit. Would you like some pilaf? Just tea, please. Okay. Crumbling outside, bustling inside. Welcome to Tarabai's guesthouse! Thank you. Ms. Shakuntala, don't mind... But we've never seen any single ladies here before. Why? What about me? She's come here to build her future, just like you. Right? Actually... I've come here to escape from my past. What's so dark about your past? I shot a man. Why aren't you in jail, then? He didn't die. Only one ear got blown off. It bled quite a bit though. What happened? Please eat! Come on, guys! Shakuntala's obviously joking. She's joking! I was going to start sleeping with a stick at night! Tarabai, I scared your houseguests right on arrival, didn't I! A girl who follows her heart and laughs with abandon... What could be more scary to men? I swear. I've never understood this disparity between men and women! That's why you're so special! You managed to escape the Dheeraj incident and get here. But how will you pay next month's rent? I have my Maths! A Math show, did you say, love? Yes! People are giving me difficult sums... And I am giving them answers quickly-quickly! Why do you think people will part with their good money... To see something stupid like that? I can't possibly allow my girls who come from all over the world... To be exposed to this mumbo-jumbo! An Indian woman in a sari and pigtails doing mathematical sums on stage is a joke! Sir. Joke also - Indian man in loincloth with a stick. But he won! There you are. All yours. That's astonishing. How did you do that? I'm correct? Indeed you are! Thank you. Is audience having any more question for me? Great stuff with the mathematics... But we're going to need a translator for this fresh-off-the-boat English! Excuse me. That was... Did they teach you some special mental-math technique at University? I'm never going to any school. Then how University? You didn't go to school? I'm having no childhood only... I'm Javier, by the way. 'Havee', means? J-A-V-I-E-R. Javier. What happened to J? The J is silent. See! Alphabets, so much confusion. Numbers, no confusion! What you see is what you getting. What you're getting is a cold. Yes. Because, it's 'Hanuary', no? The J is silent! Would you care for a hot English cup of tea? Sure! Three spoons of sugar! Otherwise your English Chai is not having any taste only. I'm not English. I'm from Spain originally. Oh I see! All you white guys look the same! Shakuntala, what is it that you love about being on stage? People's faces, when they see a girl in chotis doing maths. Choti? Plaits! Oh! So many years people are singing, dancing, doing drama, circus on stage. Then why I cannot do Maths on stage? Shakuntala, then allow me to take your Math performance to the next level! Next level? You mean third floor? The world needs to see you, Shakuntala. But it would require what one would call a bit of a... makeover? But I have one condition... Mr 'Javier With J Silent'. Means... my Saree isn't going anywhere. God-Promise. What? Means, if you are breaking this promise... I will lose all my talent. That's pretty dramatic. We Indians are like that only. Drama or nothing! "Betty Botter bought a bit of butter..." "But the butter Betty Botter bought was a bit bitter and made her batter bitter." "Crazy Camels, Calm Camels, the Camel Clans Clashed!" I thought I was the teacher here. Teaching means learning everyday, J-Silent. Okay, you go first. "Betty Botter bought a bit of butter..." "But the butter Betty Botter bought was a bit bitter and made her batter bitter." Now you! Donning butterfly wings To the west the easterlies blow Washing over this Spring Is an all new glow Save the heart from the evil eye With all the joy it's taken in I dream in English now Life's made a new beginning This story's taken a turn I do what the heart yearns Never mind the English Queen It's Queen India reigning supreme! This story's taken a turn I do what the heart yearns Never mind the English Queen It's Queen India reigning supreme! Now say, Mrs. Astrid Moore asks you to multiply Take the first digit, which is 8 And multiply it by 8+1 which is... Nine! Multiply 8 X 9, which is Take the two 5's from the units place and multiply them. 5 X 5 is... Put the two together and what's your answer? How are you? Jolly good. How about you? I'm a bit poorly. Oh blimey! Let me get you a cup of tea! Ah, that's so awfully kind of you! Thank you! Now onto the next trick. May I request His Excellency, the Spanish Ambassador to tell us his favourite year? That would be 1935, Senorita. And favourite date in a month? Let's see... the 14th! Okay. Now I am going to tell you on which days of the week the 14th of each month occurred in 1935. Please check! Beginning with January... - Am I correct? - Si Si perfecto, Senora! Gracias! This story's taken a turn I do what the heart yearns Never mind the English Queen It's Queen India reigning supreme! Tarabai! I got five more shows!. I'll pay this month's rent in advance! Look who's rolling in riches! There's a letter for you from home. Dear Shakuntala... It's been six months since you left for London... And you haven't sent a penny home yet. You know your father's temper... So I'm writing this letter with Srinivas' help. Don't you have any responsibility towards your family? Sharda's no more, but we're still here. They treat me like a bank, not a daughter! Didn't even ask once, 'Shaku, how are you?' That doesn't mean they don't love you! They've never asked, Tarabai! And from now on, I won't ask either. Wait, Shakuntala! Mother, you needn't write to me again. You will get your money every month. Dear friends across the airwaves... Let's see if ShakuntalaDevi makes India proud next! shall compete against the fastest computer on London's top TV channel! After the great Aryabhatt and Ramanujan... Let's see if Shakuntala Devi makes India proud next! Stay calm... Speak clearly... Don't get nervous. J-Silent, be silent. My numbers never let me down. Shakuntala... There is something I need to tell you. "Crazy Camels, Calm Camels..." "The Camel Clans Clashed!" That's right! Not bad Ms. Devi, not bad at all. Now Ms. Devi,could you give us the cube root of 923. Am I correct? Ms. Devi, I think we are ready to take this to the next level! You mean third floor? I'm sorry? It would be my absolute pleasure. Ms. Devi, are you able to give us the cube root of Come on, Ms. Devi. All of India is looking at you with bated breath. I'm afraid this question is wrong. Are you suggesting the computer is wrong, Ms. Devi? The computer has already given its answer. The question is not wrong. I could show you where the computer went wrong. Thanks to Lord Ganesha, my answers are never wrong. This isn't the Great Indian Rope Trick, Ms. Devi. Though you do look like you're at the end of your rope. No, the computer has made a mistake. Actually, three mistakes... You know, I was quite excited that a lady mathematician from the land of snake charmers and elephants could somehow beat the computer. But not everyone can be Einstein, can they? All I'm asking you is to check the last three digits of the number please... Unfortunately, that's all we have time for today. No, can you- - Goodnight and see you next week! - Can you please check it once? He's right, isn't he? Humans make mistakes, computers don't. Right? But I can't be wrong! Why? Aren't you human? The entire country had its eyes on me. Everyone's laughing at me, Tarabai. Shakuntala! Shakuntala. Someone's here to see you, come down quick! I don't want to meet anyone. Just come! And wash your face. Enough of this crying! Come on quickly. Good morning. Is this any time to show me your silly grin? The TV has been flooded with calls from people asking them to re-check the question last night! I made a few calls myself! Had gin early in the morning? The people got experts to do the calculations manually... And you were right! The computer made a rounding error. That's exactly that I was trying to tell that idiot... That the last three digits of that number were jumbled up! Darling you're speaking in Hindi again! The number they gave me was And he said the answer is 166917. But when any number ending in 7 is multiplied by itself three times... The answer has to end in 3! So the cube of 166917 has to end in 3! So the correct question would have been I was correct. The computer was wrong! And that's why they named you the Human Computer! Huh? God-promise! You're all over the papers. Look. Shakuntala... My Human Computer. The world is calling. Are you ready? Are you done? - Done. - Okay. So do you want me to give you the answer from left to right or right to left? I'll give it to you from right to left. Please take it down? The answer is... Am I correct? Absolutely correct! Sari-clad calculating prodigy confounds Maths experts The Indian Human Computer wows Europe Devi in Demand: Makes Maths Entertaining Human Computer knows how to convert her Maths into Money! Shakuntala Devi: A True Rags-to-Riches story Shelly! Shakuntala! Tarabai! Welcome to Shakuntala's palace! British house, British clothes! But I still only wear sarees at my shows, Tarabai! So how many cities did you tour last month, Shakuntala? Thirteen, my dear Gordanbhai! Goodness! I haven't seen thirteen cities in my entire lifetime! Why, Tarabai! We're humans, not trees. We have legs, not roots. Tell me why? Why? So we can roam the world! Shakuntala... J-Silent... Hi! Can we talk? What do you mean, you're going back to Spain? You always knew this day would come. I also know I'm going to die someday. Doesn't mean I'm okay with it. You are rich and famous! You don't need me, Shakuntala. Why do men always want women to need them? Shakuntala, I'm sorry... Javier With J Silent... I'm sorry that my love isn't enough for you. Go. Find someone who needs you. Go! Look Sharda, I've become such a big woman. But you're still the one I talk to in the middle of the night. Cheers! I'll talk to her. - No. - Yeah, let me talk to her! - No! - Let's end this daily soap opera. Let's just finish it off and- No, no Ajay! - No. Please, no! - Why not? You know I don't want to talk to her! - Okay fine, but I can- - Ajay, no. Why not? Sorry sir! It took a while to get the keys from office. Please come. They told me in the office that you're Shakuntala Devi's daughter. You're so lucky... Your mother's such a genius! I was ten years old when she visited our school... She changed my life. I was a duffer in class, and I became a topper! Your Maths must be very good too. Right, ma'am? I hate Maths. Okay, there are two bedrooms here. You can build more rooms upstairs, if you plan to have kids in the future. We're never having kids. Sorry, sir. We're not buying this house for ourselves. Anu's business, I mean our business ... We buy such houses, refurbish them... We decorate and resell them. I see! So different from Shakuntala Devi, no? Yes, I'm nothing like Shakuntala Devi... And I'm buying this house, not Shakuntala Devi. I hate Maths and I don't want to ever be a mother. Will you still sell us this house or should we call another broker? Ajay... Didn't I tell you before marriage... That you don't want kids. And I respect that. But why did you get mad at that poor guy? I'm tired, Ajay. Everyone just sees me as Shakuntala Devi's daughter. But I only see you! I know my dreams aren't big... But they're your own! Own it! Exactly. Exactly! I don't want to be a genius. Don't be one! I don't want to conquer the world. We won't. I don't want to be on the covers of top magazines. - Or be on TV. - Then don't! Aunty, please have this. Ma, have this. I've made it. Sure, I believe you. Such a cutie-pie he is! Do you know... Before he was born, we had a puppy too. I was always away, thanks to my posting. So the puppy gave her company as well as practice. Practice for what? Taking care of babies! Ajay. I need to get the lasagna out of the oven. Can you come help? Excuse me. Nice smell! What? That's the oven bell ringing, not my biological clock! So don't get too excited! What are you talking about? Did you think Dennis will awaken my maternal instincts? I'll suddenly turn into Mother India? If this was so important to you, why did you marry me? It was just a gift! I wanted to see a smile on your face, that's it! Then why did your mom mention a baby? Why don't you go ask her? My mother doesn't represent me, okay? And till you keep obsessing about your mother... Things will never work out between us! Plan to serve lasagna, or a divorce notice? How will it work if we both overreact? Sorry? Marriage means always having to say you're sorry. I must be the world's biggest fool in love. You're the second biggest. Who's Number One, then? Sir. Shakuntala Ma'am sent this for you. Help, help! I'm dying of boredom. Shakuntala! I've been waiting for you for so long! Who's this? Dushyant! Shakuntala's lover across lifetimes! Yes, but only in India, okay? I have different lovers in different countries. How many countries? Well, my goal is 150 lovers across 150 countries. I haven't found anyone in Iceland yet. Do you know anyone there? Ms. Devi, we must get going. Excuse us. - Good day. - Good day, Ms. Devi. 150 countries. Good Lord! Hello, Dushyant! Paritosh Banerji. IAS. Hi. So you're a Bureaucratic Superhero? You have to be a superhero when you work for the government. Then prove it and rescue me From this boring party. O my darlin' On this dreamy night With the stars so bright It's time to shine and dazzle Shine and dazzle, oh yes! Why yes.. Let's soak in the rain Whispering sweet nothings Dance? Let's shine and dazzle Shine and dazzle, oh yes! Why yes... Let's soak in the rain Tiptoe over to me Your lover's waiting eagerly You know what? I was going to cancel this trip. Are you afraid of flying? I hate being out of Calcutta even for four days. And I hate being in any city for more than four days! - We are doomed. - Opposites attract! Let's write upon the skies This tale of yours and mine How two hearts meet And melt in a love so sweet, oh yes! Why yes... Tiptoe over to me I have a confession to make. My track record is sketchy. I'm divorced. Congratulations. If you weren't divorced, you wouldn't be here! Why yes.. Let's soak in the rain Whispering sweet nothings Let's shine and dazzle Shine and dazzle, oh yes! Why yes... Let's soak in the rain I'll miss you a lot. And what if I said you won't have to miss me? What do you mean? Let's go. I'll come along with you. Let me see what Calcutta has, that you are unable to leave. And what if I don't let you leave Calcutta? This is the finest house in Ballygunge. This street's called Party Street. In Calcutta, 'party' can also mean political party! You know, the number of this house is 720. Which is 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 As well as 8 x 9 x 10. Poor 7 got left out. Wow. And whose house is this? Mine! As in? I bought it. - When? - Last evening. Have you gone crazy? I liked it, so I bought it. Besides... You'll be happier here than in your dreary official residence. Are you proposing to me? I want a baby with an intelligent and good-looking man, after all! Never thought I'd hear that word from your mouth. Why, it's such a simple word! B-A-B-Y, baby. You can't settle in one place... You're out to conquer the world, and... And a mother can't do that? You can do anything you want. So, tell me... When do I bring the wedding procession? I asked for a baby. Not a husband! Shakuntala. My parents... Are against our relationship. I don't care. Do you? I want to meet your parents. I want their blessings. Take a left from ahead. You'll cross some cows and buffaloes on the way. You'll see my mother doing all the housework... And my father will be there too... Reading the newspaper sitting on his ancient chair. Won't you come along? You wanted their blessings, not me. Forgive them, Shakuntala. Maybe love will prevail over duty? I can't forgive them. I had no expectations from my father anyway. Whoever was of no use to him, didn't exist. But my mother ... She just stood there like a statue. Helpless. Weak. Mute. She never spoke up for herself... She could have at least opened her mouth to save her daughter from death. I wanted to do this in front of your parents, but... Shakuntala, I love you very much. Marry me, please? Isn't the diamond a bit small for a wedding ring? It's perfect for me. That's because you've become used to settling for less. After 200 calls, I thought you called me here to say sorry. I called you to know why despite being my daughter... How can marriage be your only ambition, Anu! My only ambition is to not become like you. I know how successful and famous you are. You never stop reminding me, do you? At least take a look, Anu... Compliments from the chef. Shakuntala Maam, it's an absolute honour to serve you. How sweet. When today's generation recognizes me, I feel I've done something right. And if you don't she takes out her 'Black-Book' to show you how famous she is. Ignore her. Thank you. - Just see it once, Anu... - Stop it Ma. I'm tired of being on this rollercoaster! I'm tired of being your daughter. This is that boy speaking, not you. You've lost your identity, Anu! Just divorce him, I say! Come home with me. All my properties, shares, money... it's all for you, isn't it? I don't need you or your money. Anu! Actually Ma, I'm divorcing you. How can anyone divorce their mother! Why... Didn't you? You'll understand when you have a daughter. Because of you, I never want to be a mother. That's what happens. Sometimes when you're least expecting it, you're expecting. That's what we call the miracle of life. It's been 8 weeks. Congratulations. Anu, you're going to be a mom. Anu! Anu! Anu! Look, I won't lie. Today's the happiest day of my life. A child is a responsibility of a lifetime. I know. Everyone handles it. We can too! Not everyone can handle it, Ajay. Just for once, forget all your baggage and your parents. Listen to your heart. How do you feel? I feel... thrilled. I feel so happy that... it scares me. Yes! Sorry, we're having a baby. If it's a girl, we'll call her Amritha. Amrit if it's a boy. You're making a scene! We're making a family! My baby! Our baby. I'm the one with 3 inch long stitches. But sure, 'our baby'. Okay fine, your baby. What happened, Shakuntala? Is Anu okay? Yes. What's the matter? Paritosh, I'm not just a mother. I'm still me. As in? When I recite rhymes to Anu, my mind buzzes with numbers. When she hears the rattle and claps I miss the applause of my audience. When I look at the verandah, it reminds me of my stage. Why aren't you on stage, then? What about Anu? Anu has two parents, Shakuntala. You mean I can do my shows? Since when did you start asking for permission? Outside India too? If you lose a part of yourself we'll lose a part of us, right? Okay. Okay! The problem got solved so easily! And I was expecting fireworks. We can still have fireworks. Shakuntala, you're getting late. Give her to me. It's time for your flight. Go now. When I told my manager that I wanted to start doing my math shows again he was shocked. He said, 'But ma'am, you've just had a baby!' I said, 'Why?' 'Have I turned into a different person?' Do women lose their brains after becoming mothers? So today, shall we see if this new mother's brain is still working or not? Can I have the questions please? Ms. Devi, the questions from the audience. The first question... Thank you. Thank you. How are you doing it? How? Ma Genius: Ready to conquer the world That took 50 seconds. The computer is still calculating. There it is. The computer got it in 62 seconds. She's right! Ms. Devi calculated the 23rd root of a 201 digit number Faster than the fastest computer, the UNIVAC! Thank you. Ms. Devi, how? How do you do it? How! Shakuntala Devi's magic spreads across the world! What's her secret? Are you ready? Okay, the answer is... Am I correct? That's absolutely correct. Thank you. This is the largest mental multiplication ever done In record time by a human being! I think Ms. Devi just made it to the Guinness Book of World Records! How do you do it Ms. Devi? The question on everyone's mind: How does she do it? What is the cube root of Correct! What is the cube root of So, did you find out how I do it? Ms. Devi, your rather unexceptional reaction times on a battery of elementary cognitive tasks. which were compared with the mean RTs of adults on the same tests Contrasts so markedly with your amazing speed of performing huge arithmetic calculations as to indicate that your skill with numbers must depend largely on the automatic encoding and retrieval of a wealth of declarative and procedural information in long term memory rather than on any unusual basic capacities. English please. After all the tests... We cannot really explain how exactly you do it, Ms. Devi. How could those English scientists know... It's impossible to decipher the great Shakuntala Devi. Exactly! So, what's my daughter up to? Your daughter just spoke her first word... Daddy! Daddy... Remember those musical shoes you got her from the States? She runs around the house in them, chanting "Daddy, Daddy!" Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello? Hello, I can't hear you. Hello? Hello? Hello? I don't understand. Why can't the three of us travel the world together? I belong here, in Calcutta. I thought we belonged together. What will I do there? You'll be busy with your shows! And I'm not your stepney. If you were a world famous mathematician doing shows worldwide... Not just you, the whole world would expect me to pack my bags and string along with you. I've always supported you and your career! Thanks! I've taken care of Anu when you haven't been around! Wow. You deserve a Nobel prize for taking care of your own daughter! Like you get prizes for abandoning your daughter? This. This is what you really are! You're just like all the other men! What are you doing! Have you gone crazy? Paritosh. Maths is everything to me. But Anu's even more important than Maths. I'm sorry. I said those things in anger. If you don't want to come with me... That's your choice. But Anu will stay with me now. She'll go wherever I go. She's a child, Shakuntala... Not a suitcase to be dragged city to city. I can't stay without my daughter anymore. I can't stay without her either! I gave birth to her. I have three inch long stitches on me. I have more right on her. Just giving birth doesn't make one a mother, Shakuntala. I'll be the world's best mother! Shakuntala! Dear Dad. London is nothing like the descriptions in storybooks. There are just two kinds of weather here. Rain and winter. I want to come to Calcutta. I wait for your letter everyday. I miss you a lot, Dad. The world needs to discover Vedic Maths. Just like my daughter Anu has. Say Hello, Anu. This is Edward. - Hello. - Hi. Hello. Go on, Edward. Ask her a question! Oh. That won't be necessary. No, I insist. Ask her! What's 409 square? Correct! How did she do that? Tell him, sweetie. So the first two digits of the answer will be the first digit. 4 square, which is 16. And the last two digits of the answer will be the last digit. 9 square, which is 81. And the middle two digits are two times of the first and last number. That's 2x4x9. Which is 72. So the answer is 167281. Very good! I got a three-book deal, only because of you. Thank you! Please post this to Dad. What's this? A letter for him. Don't forget. Don't forget! Yes ma'am. Shall we go to the park? My mind wants to go to the park. But my instinct says... Sorry, Anu. Sorry! Dear Dad. Apart from being a world-famous Mathematician... Ma's now become a world-famous Astrologer too. She says she has both the intellect for Maths and the instinct for Astrology. I think Ma's become very rich. Ma says you don't have the time to call or write to me. Is that true, Dad? I'll be back in three months, you can take an appointment then. Most definitely! It's all Lord Ganesha's blessing! I'll take your leave. Goodbye. Goodbye! What a day, Anu. 25 appointments! What questions did Uncle have? Everyone has only two questions. Will I get money? Will I get love? But I have another question. What? Will I get my father? I have a question too. What do you think of my poster? 'Erase Poverty' isn't just an empty slogan for me. I've erased poverty from my own life. Please give me your precious vote... I'll remove poverty and unemployment... Dear Dad. Ma isn't just a mathematician and astrologer now... She's become a politician too. Everyone says that she's the only one Who can defeat Indira Gandhi in these elections. The results will be out today. Ma... Back so soon? Anu... Turn off the TV, please. Yes, Ma. Here. What's this? Are the results out? Did you lose? Absolutely not. I never lose, Anu. Always remember that. Come on, let's pack our bags. I've booked 10 maths shows. 10 cities. Bombay, Nagpur, Poona, Hyderabad, Vijayawada. I need five numbers. Each one of you will give me one number. Let's begin! Now I'm going to make a 'Magic Square' with these 5 digits. Add up any row or column and you'll get the same answer. Want to see how? What's the answer? What's the answer? Dear Dad, I go to so many schools with Ma. But I want to go to my own school. In one place. I don't want to travel the world. Please do something, Dad. Anu? Please? Please? Cheers! Cheers. So? All the way from Calcutta to Bombay. How come? How's my daughter? She's happy. I really enjoy reading her letters. You didn't give her any of my letters, did you? She wouldn't be able to handle it, Paritosh. Between two continents and two parents... She'd be torn. And confused. I've heard it many times. Shakuntala, please put her in a proper school now. Please. 'Proper' schools kill creativity in children. Besides, Anu travels the world! She meets intellectuals from various countries. It's the best kind of education. You're doing this for yourself, not for Anu. You want Anu to be with you all the time. Yes, I do. Why not? She's my daughter. I have every right on her. Anu's your daughter. You don't own her. Children can claim their parents for the rest of their lives... But parents can't claim their children forever. That's the universal rule of life. I don't believe in such pathetic rules. You're behaving exactly like your father. You're stealing Anu's childhood just like he stole yours. How dare you compare me to that man! I'm nothing like him. Shakuntala, put Anu in a proper school this academic year, or else... I'll have to go to court for her custody. Not joint.. but full custody. You know, for a while I felt like we still stood a chance, but... You don't need me, Shakuntala. I don't need you, Paritosh. I love... Loved you. I can't be a nomad like you. And I can't be a tree like you. From Shimla to the Nilgiri Hills... Here are the brochures for India's best boarding schools. Choose. - I don't get this. - What? This is so easy! Surprise! Hello girls! Aren't these skirts a bit too long? Get a scissor and snip them! Anu, my baby... I missed you! Come on, give me a hug! Summer holidays start in 4 days. I know. But I managed to coax your principal. We're going to Nairobi tomorrow, then Cape Town, Toronto, Paris... Lucky Anu! I spend summer holidays on my sofa, in KPBB mode. What's 'KPBB'? 'Keep Pigging-out and Become a Buffalo!' CAJGBPQ! What's that? C'mon And Just Get a Bag Packed Quick! Okay, bye girls! Dear Dad. It's been ten years since I saw you. I want to come to Calcutta for at least one summer holiday. - My sister Sharda... - I'm tired of this Shakuntala Devi World Tour. We were so poor that we couldn't afford to take her to a doctor. Since then, I've tried to fulfill both our dreams. That is so inspiring. So inspiring! Now let's talk about this book launch. Sure! You've taken on quite a brave and controversial topic... Don't be scared to say the title of the book loudly! The World of Homosexuals. I believe love is love. Who we choose to love is our personal matter. Given that you aren't homo...sexual... How did you write this book? Well I haven't killed anyone either... But I've written a book called 'Perfect Murder'! Actually I got interested in homosexuality because... My ex-husband was a homosexual. I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you okay? No, you should not be sorry. It is his choice and I support him. You are incredibly amazing. So amazing! Thank you. Anu. Anu! Anu, stop! What is this behaviour, Anu! "My father was a lion-tamer, he didn't give me food..." "He forced me to do shows..." "Poor me! Poor me!" And now you're after my Dad! How can you lie through your teeth like this? Anu, that... Anu! Look at the larger picture! I want to change people's attitudes towards homosexuality. Personal stories affect people the most. If you want to sell something, you need to weave a story around it... A fake story? That too about my father? Why can't you be normal like other moms? Why should I be normal when I can be amazing? Can we go home and talk, please? Which home? Ritz or Claridges? Everyday it's a new hotel room.. I don't know how it feels to have a home. Just like I don't know what it's like to have a mother! If only you loved me half as much as you love Maths... I want to live with Dad! But your father doesn't want to live with you. When he finds out about the rumours you spread about him... Then he'll want me to stay with him! Dad! You came from Calcutta! I'm becoming a grandfather, after all... Oh God! Easy, easy! - How are you? - I'm fine. She called you a homosexual. So? Nothing wrong with being a homosexual, right? According to her, your entire life is a lie. You know I don't care about all these things. But I do! I hate that people think you're living a double-life. If there's one thing I've learnt from your mother... It's that life's too short to care about what others think. If you love her so much, why did you divorce her? To love Shakuntala is to let her be. She's like a storm. And to fight a storm is foolishness. So you got all philosophical and stepped aside. I didn't have a choice, Anu. Ma didn't hold a gun to your head, Dad! You chose to let me go! I don't have it in me to fight your mother. You don't have the courage to fight Ma... But I do! Anu! Talk to her, man. Uncle it's okay, you know how she is... My water broke! What? Anu! Call the doctor now! Ma! House number 689. Guess why this number is special? All numbers are special to you, Ma. Because 689 remains 689, even upside down. Fascinating. Angry young woman! You know, Hyde Park is just 5 minutes from here! Great. People living here can go there for a walk everyday. I've bought this house for both of us, Anu. Let's do lazy Sundays. Let's do 'KPBB'! What about your Math shows? I'm taking a break for a while. I want to be your full-time mom. And you can speak to your Dad too, if you like. No! Okay, give me the keys! Give me the keys! Here, here! Ma, three floors! Happy? Ma, can I redecorate this house on my own? You're just 16! You haven't studied or trained in interior design. How will you do it, Anu? Did you ever do a Maths course? Correct. Please, Ma? I've admired other people's homes since I was a kid. I want to build my own home. Okay, let's build our home then! Let me capture you Right here in my smile Lest I lose you again O my prized one Let me hide you Away from prying eyes Like a reflection, I emerged from you Why can't I be all you need? You're like a puzzle I've always tried to solve Just be my mom For once and for all? You're like a puzzle I've always tried to solve Just be my mom For once and for all? Look, Anu. There's a pattern in these branches. So that every leaf gets its share of sunlight. Snowflakes have similar patterns too. Nature's the greatest mathematician. Ma... No! Sorry, sorry... No maths. Sometimes my very own Sometimes a stranger unknown You leave me so perplexed If only for a moment, I could banish this world All my heart wants Is to feel your caresses As you untangle my tresses Until I drift to sleep Where else would you want to be? Don't leave me alone To stumble and fall Just be my mom For once and for all? You're like a puzzle I've always tried to solve Just be my mom For once and for all? Why are you dragging me, Anu? - We just bought a house! - Ma, ma... This house was built in 1858. I want to buy and refurbish it completely. And then we'll rent it out. The profits from rent can go into buying the next property... The rent will increase every year and we'll easily recover the cost. And we'll add to our properties too. In whose name shall I make the cheque? Ma, it's a huge amount. 400,000 pounds. No amount is too much to see this twinkle in your eyes! When did my little baby grow so big? No... Sleep, sleep... Aw, baby... Hush, hush... Anu... What happened, sweetheart? I can't even put my daughter to sleep! It's your first baby! Give yourself some time. It's been so long. Maybe I just don't have that instinct. I'm a really bad mother. Can I tell you a secret? Every mother is a 'bad mother'. If she loves her kids too much, she spoils them. If she doesn't love them enough, she still spoils them. The perfect mother doesn't exist! Something serious... My girl! Were you two gossiping about me? You're not that important. I was just telling Anu... That however she is, she's a perfect mother. That's right. The first time I saw her... I knew she'd be the perfect mother. When you first met me, you thought I had the perfect mother. And that! They said, "How do you do it?" "Ms. Devi!" Hello. Hello, ma'am. Hello. How do you do it? So many Hellos. Not letting me finish the story... Good evening, Shakuntala Devi Ma'am! Big fan. I'm Ajay Abhaya Kumar. Nice to meet you. By the way, did you want to meet me or my daughter? Well I'd have to impress you first to stand a chance with her! We go back a long way. - Really? - Yes. When I was little, my Dad took me on his scooter every Sunday to meet my grandparents. And did I know your grandparents? No, hear me out. - That house of yours in Bangalore... - Yes. It used to come en route. Whenever we crossed it, Dad would say: "Do you know who lives here?" "The great Shakuntala Devi!" He would tell me: "Shakuntala Devi is from Bangalore." "And so are you." "The only difference is, she's always out of the country thanks to Maths..." "And you're always out of class!" So? Did your Maths improve? No. I thought, India's already produced this century's biggest Math Genius... Why should I even bother? Ajay Abhaya Kumar... I have an instinct. Your destiny's about to change. You're going to hit the jackpot! Thank you, ma'am. Since an astrologer like you is saying it, I accept my fate humbly. Maybe I should buy a lottery ticket on my way back? Your glasses are empty. Please allow me to refill them. Good idea! Thank you. No problem! Ajay Abhay Kumar... I should find out more about him. Why? Plan on marrying him? Yes. To you! My instinct says, this boy will be my son-in-law some day. No, no, no! Ajay comes from a very normal family. So I need all of us to act normal too. We promise you, Anu. We'll be so normal that they won't even notice us. They'll be amazed at how normal we are. I really love Ajay. When I'm with him, I feel complete. Like I've found my soulmate. Please don't mess this up today. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. And even if it isn't, just have a baby with Ajay... Because he's so intelligent and good looking! Shakuntala! Ma! Is this your idea of normal? Anu is a really normal girl! She was very normal at studies. Her career is super normal too! You must try her cakes someday. They're deliciously normal! Correct! Saying 'normal' every few seconds isn't really normal behaviour, you know... The weather's so hot, right? What's the cricket match score? There's no cricket match today. Your saree looks so pretty! So much corruption these days, right? - Very bad... - Very bad. Why are we discussing all this... Isn't that what normal people talk about? Thank God you aren't normal. Where else would we find such entertaining in-laws! Have some sweets. I made them myself. Really? I ordered them from Sri Krishna Sweets. I was also just pretending to be normal! I can't breathe... But you look classy! Come come... There are lots of options! Aunty, I don't really wear formals... This will look good on you! Pandy! Ma'am. Look. Now he looks like Shakuntala Devi's son-in-law! Correct! Pandy, here is my credit card. We're going to shop a lot. Aunty, please don't. Please return the card. No... Why? Please return the card. Pandy! Sorry, Sir. - Ajay! - Aunty what are you doing! Please don't... It's a gift from me, keep it! I've never told you, but I'm very rich. I just pretend to be middle-class! But Aunty, I really am middle-class. Well, once you move to London with me after marriage... You won't remain middle-class anymore. And I will take your business to new heights. Wait and watch! But I'm not shifting to London. Oh! But long distance marriage is really difficult. Take it from me! But Anu's moving to Bangalore, right? Anu's life is in London with me. But she'll be with me after marriage. I can't live without Anu. But it's normal, Aunty. You can't jail your daughter like this. 'Normal'? When a boy's mother expects her daughter-in-law to live with her, it's 'normal'. But if a girl's mother expects her son-in-law to live with her, she's jailing her? What logic is that, I say! - Aunty I'm sorry, I didn't mean that... - What did you mean? Anu won't live with you or my parents. We've decided to live in our own house after marriage. Anu will never leave me and go to Bangalore. Why don't you ask her once... What she really wants? Aunty, she loves me... And I love her more than anything! Anyone. You love her more than anyone? What have you done for her? Have you got this? You're not the world's only mother to have a C-section! He wants to snatch you away from me, Anu! Moving with him is my own decision! But I've planned our whole life ahead, Anu! And who gave you the right to plan my life? I have dreams of my own too! And what about my dreams? You made me give up my shows, astrology... I gave up Maths for you! I lost everything so I could have you, Anu! I'm so sorry! You deserve the Nobel prize for looking after your daughter! Sorry. Sorry Anu. Anu... So... What about your business in London? I can run it from here. If you leave me for that boy... You can say goodbye to your business too. You already separated me from Dad... I won't let you take my love away now! And if that means losing the business I built with my own hard work... So be it! That fellow is feeding you rubbish, I'm telling you Anu! What are you doing? Anu, just listen to... What are you doing? Anu. Anu! Where are you going? Anu! Anu, let's... Anu! Anu! You are right Shakuntala, but... Yes, but... That's true, but... Right. Come what may... I'm going to marry Ajay. Now you decide, Dad... If you're on my side... Or Ma's. This is Anu Banerji. I'm sorry I can't take your call right now, please leave your number- Ladies and Gentlemen... Welcome to The Mohan Manhas Show! Where we crack jokes with famous folks! Our special guest today calls herself the 'Human Computer'. I call myself Shakuntala. People call me the Human Computer. So Ms. Devi, we hear you're doing very few shows of late... Planning to retire? Why would I retire... When I can set a stage on fire! Ooh! Your sense of humour is surely intact! So tell us... Have your Maths skills reduced with age? Age is just a number. And numbers love me! And may I ask... How old are you? - If you don't mind... - No, no I don't mind. I'm a day older than yesterday... And a day younger than tomorrow. Now you do the Math! Well played, well played! Okay then, let's keep playing. We also have some Math problems for you. I thought this was just a talk show. Wherever you go, Maths follows. Right? Starting easy. What's the cube of 121. 1761561. Sorry, I meant 1771561 which is also the 4th power of 11. Ms. Devi, if my calculations are right... I think you mean the sixth power of 11? You are correct. You're in the Guinness Book of World Records... So our next question should be a piece of cake for you... On your screen! Ms. Devi? I'm sorry... My head hurts. I haven't slept well the last few nights... Can I get a two minute break please? Of course. Looks like the 'Human computer' finally crashed today! Don't go anywhere. We'll be right back after a short break with The Mohan Manhas Show! Stop here. The car can't go any further. Shakuntala, you need to practice. You're booked for ten shows next week. What goes around comes around. Wait till your daughter gives you a hard time! You'll be a big man someday. Why would I be a man? Because there's no such thing as a 'big woman'! In that case, I'll definitely be a big woman. - God-promise? - God- promise. Amma, I'm talking to you! Have you lost your voice? Why can't you speak up in front of him? Amma! Hello. Vasanti? I want to speak to my lawyer. - Hi! Thanks a lot for coming. - Thank you. Hello. Thanks for coming. Let me know what you think of the house. Hi! Please see all the rooms and tell me what you think. Thank you so much. - Hi! - Anu! It's been so long. Congratulations! Thank you so much! It's a dream come true. I've refurbished four houses. I hope we find good buyers now. We've invested a lot! - We were congratulating you about Amritha! - Exactly! Thank you. - She's also a dream come true for me. - 'Also'? Anu, you're a mother now. You should just have one dream now. Exactly. But where is she? We still haven't met her. How old is she now? She's very young right now. And I was so busy with work, that... Busy, really? This is the time for you to enjoy her childhood. These days won't ever come back! You know Anu, I took a maternity break from my job for my first baby. And before I knew it, I had another child. Then I thought, 'Let it go. I can always pick up a job later.' My children needed me. And I don't think of this as sacrifice. It's my duty! Absolutely, it's never a sacrifice. Please eat something. I'll just go check on things. - Hey, nice house! -Thanks. Anu. You killed it! Everyone's full of praise for you. - I'm going home. - Why? We're both here, and Amritha's there alone... It's okay! Her nanny's there. But her mom isn't. I'm leaving, you handle the rest. Listen! - Excuse me. - Yeah sure. Anu. She's fast asleep. I need to talk to you. I need to tell you something first. Okay. You know, Ajay... Maybe I was too harsh on Ma. She calls me everyday and I've never answered. I've decided... I'm going to call Ma and tell her about Amritha. First see what she's done. Your mother has used her power of attorney and sold all your properties. My business properties in London? Yes. And what about my profit share? Zero. Nothing. Absolutely zilch. In fact the capital gains tax liability is completely on your name. Which means you will have to pay it. We'll have to pay it. How much? So much that even if we sell our house and both our businesses... We still won't be able to pay it off, Anu. Your mother has finished us. We're finished! Now what? We have two options. Either we sell everything we have, borrow money from friends... Take a bank loan and get rid of this liability. I'll take the other option. The other option is legal. We'll have to go to London and file a court case against your mother. A criminal case. She could go to jail. She wanted to fight. Now she'll have to fight a war. You need to be strong and brutal. Don't get carried away by any emotions. We will win this. Yes. Yes, we will. Hello everyone. Ms. Banerji, If you could take a seat, please? Anu. Let's begin. My client Ms. Anupama Banerji would like to... press criminal charges against her mother... for unlawfully selling her properties that were in both their names... and sending the tax bill to an unsuspecting Ms. Banerji. My client Shakuntala Devi vehemently denies this charge. It was her money that Anupama Banerji used to build this business. And Ms. Banerji did not repay a penny of it. So this justifies the tax bill completely. Shakuntala Devi is an unfit mother... who chased her ambitions at the cost of raising her own daughter. That's a false accusation. Did she not take Anu out of the country? Did you not stop her from going to school with other children? She took her out of the country from show to show, hotel to hotel... Depriving her of any childhood. Did she not keep Anu away from her father for ten years? Ten years! And not even one letter was passed on from her beloved father... And did she not accuse her father of being a homosexual... At a public gathering! Correct. I'm sorry... What? I accept all your accusations. Your lawyer is absolutely right. I'm a terrible mother. We made a profit of one million, one thousand and one pounds exactly... After selling the properties, correct? Yes, that's right. What a beautiful number. It's called a palindrome. Meaning, it reads the same frontwards and backwards. I want to sign a cheque and give my daughter the entire amount right now. Ms. Devi, that's preposterous. Anu if you want to press criminal charges and send me to jail... God-promise, I'm ready to go to jail. Ms. Devi, you can't just lose this case like this. I never lose, Mr Stevens... I always win. I just wanted to see you once anyhow, Anu. I've seen you now. That's enough. Who does all this for such a small thing? My Drama-Queen mother! Do you have any idea of the impact of your actions? Don't you ever get tired? Anu, I spent my... entire life hating my mother... I didn't want you to hate me like that... Anu... Anu! Ms. Devi, please. We have to talk through this. Can we step out? Yes that would be a good idea. Let's all take a small break. I need to be alone. Okay. I'll be right outside if you need me, okay? Ajay! Ajay! You okay? I always used to ridicule her Black-Book... But see... She actually made one for me! This is me with the Prime Minister of Mauritius... With the President of Kenya... This is in Canada... And look, that's me with Amitabh Bachchan! Whenever Ma met a film star, she'd tell them- "My daughter's your biggest fan!" And then they would go- "Really? Which one's your favourite film?" And I would just freeze. I had no clue who they were. And Ma would burst out laughing! I always thought I had such a terrible childhood... Then why am I smiling in all these pictures? I always thought you and I are one team. That we belong to each other. But when I saw the two of you together today... I realised... Your team has changed, Anu. I can't fight with you anymore, Ma. Anu, I'm sorry. I couldn't be the mother you wanted. I wasn't exactly a model daughter either! You had to quit Maths because of me. When you left, Maths left me too, Anu... I'm sorry, Ma... I always saw you as a mother. Never as a woman. Now that I have my own daughter, I understand... What? Am I already old enough to be a grandma? Are you happy or sad! I've never been happier in my whole life! My baby. Mothers and daughters... What a waste of a day! Mothers and daughters! Mothers and daughters... Amritha! How could you name her Amritha without asking me? It's okay, gentlemen. But my instinct says... You'll have another daughter, and she'll be called Nayana! Excuse me. I'll be outside. Take your time. By the way, Ajay's not so bad after all. Thanks Ma! He reminds me of Paritosh. But living in one city, with one man, forever... What kind of life is that? Don't say 'normal'! The genius... Guinness Book record-holding world-famous Mathematician... The Human Computer! Shakuntala Devi Ma'am, it is my absolute honour... to give away the prestigious Mathematics Lifetime Achievement Award to you. Oh please! I am younger than you in mind! Shakuntala Ma'am, we can't let you go without saying a couple of words. A couple? 'Thank you.' Can I leave now? Please, no. - Can you keep it there please? - Yes. Thank you. Zero is my favorite number. Maybe because this world is round? Sometimes life teaches us lessons... By making us spin in circles! Today, I want to say something... That I haven't even said to myself before. All my life, I was angry with my mother. And I didn't realize when anger turned into hate. I was angry that she never spoke up in front of my father. Because she didn't have a voice of her own. Maybe that's why today... ...I have my own voice. It was only when my daughter explained it to me, that I realised... I always saw my mother just as a mother... And never as a woman. I never understood her. My only ambition in life... Was to not become like my mother. And so perhaps everything I am today... Is because of her. Ma! I'm proud of you! I am also who I am because of my daughter. My darling Anu, who is whistling from the audience for me. Her whistles and the pride I see in her eyes today... Is my biggest award. Every mom hopes that her daughter won't just see her as a mother... But also as a genius sometimes. Okay, I've rambled on enough... Shall we do some Maths? Yes... Is everyone low on energy? I can't hear you yet! Yes! Okay so today, I am going to introduce you to 'Miss Revolving Number'. She's very special. I'll tell you why! 142857... That's my mother. My amazing mother! Our relationship wasn't built on reverence or sacrifice. She wasn't the typical mom who exists in books and films... Because my mother knew how to live for herself. She knew how to value herself. She knew how to embrace life wholeheartedly. Everyday, I strive to be a little like her. God-promise. BODMAS. B for Bracket. O for Order. D for Division.
