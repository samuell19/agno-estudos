My mom now, she's helping me find a new wife. She told me the other day, she goes, "I found a fantastic wife for you. "From a very good background, very good family. "She's pretty, oh you love it." I said, "Wow, this is exciting, cool. "Can I see a picture?" She goes, "No, you can't see a picture." I'm like, "Why?" "She's a good girl." What? Since when good girls don't take pictures? I said, "Does she have a Facebook or something?" She goes, "No, why you wanna Facebook her? "You want to approach her?" "Well, you know, it wouldn't be a bad idea. "It would be a good way of introducing myself." And I'm thinking to myself, wait a minute. What about her? Does she know how I look like, you know, anything about this? She goes, "Yes, she does." I'm like, "What?" She goes, "She saw you on YouTube." Did she arrive safely? Yes, her flight was on time. Shahrzad joon, salam! Welcome, aziza! Salam. Thank you. I'm so sorry, I'm on the next flight. I'll see you soon. Hey Ray, let me help. Thank you. Shahrzad? Salam! I'm home! Janam, she's upstairs but we should let her sleep. Okay. She's beautiful. What's wrong? What's wrong? Elana? You up? Hi. Oh. Yes, Shahrzad is well. She's right here. Hold on. You can go talk in the other room if you want. Maman? What happened? How come no one told me about her accident? Oh, is it really that bad? Poor Shahrzad. Listen, son, no one is perfect except God. I know, I just think someone should have said something. No one will ever see it, huh? Hi, sorry. I'm the gardener. My bird kite. She can't fly up. Could you please give her back to me? Thanks. She likes you. I'm Sebastian. Hey, Parakeeta, say thank you to... What's your name? I had a bird back home. He used to sing. What happened? Please, wait. What were you reading? Rumi. Oh yeah, Elana has her book. Rumi was a man. Shahrzad joon? Oh good, you're eating. I just made some lentil soup. - Oh, I can get it. - Oh, na, na, you sit. I am a Soviet Jew. I know this looks like I'm Persian and I've been trying to pluck my chin hairs more, but I apologize off the bat for what my name means. In Farsi, it's not a nice word. Kira Soltanovich is my name. Some of you guys are confused. It's the baloney pony, are you with me? That's what my name means. Can you imagine being introduced? "Yes, sir, it's a snake trouser." Better bring up our next act. He is one of my good friends, very funny, talented guy, Sean Alani, come on let him here it! Come on! Give it up, give it up for Sean. I just go married, she's so amazing, she actually just got here from Iran. My American friends, uh, they have a hard time saying her name. Her name is Shahrzad, which is a beautiful name in Farsi and my American friends always having trouble. They can't even say the name. They're like, Sharza, Shirah, Shirzi, Shirza. I say, "Sweetheart, feel free if you want to change it. "Like, I changed my name to Sean, "would you like to do that?" And she was so graceful about it. She goes, "No, I'm not gonna change my name "and I'm gonna stay authentic." And I, personally, am very proud of her for that, anybody that can keep it real, that's incredible. Well, they look like keloid scars, but they're actually hypertrophic scars. You didn't have any scarring anywhere before the acid attacks? No. Well, they seem to be dormant. Do you have any itching or needle pains? Yes, before. We can do major reconstruction and make it look perfect but there's a risk of hypertrophic scar tissue developing again as well as itching and needle pains. Is there any other options? Absolutely, yes. I don't want to do it. Why? I just took you to the best plastic surgeon. Why do I have to do it? Well, I thought you'd want to. I mean, doesn't every woman wants to be more pretty? Hey, what's up? You want to come in? Are you okay? Yes, I, uh, who is playing piano? Oh, that's Elana. She teaches piano. Piano teacher? Mmm-hmm. Thank you. Salam. Ah, salam. Welcome home. Thank you. Mmm, smells good. Here you go. Thanks. Sean, they had an idea. How about Shahrzad takes a few piano lessons from that woman, the piano teacher? Hi. Please, come in. Oh, hello. Elana, this is Sha... Shahrzad. Hello. Sheherazade, my favorite ballet. Welcome, Princess Sheherazade. Thank you. Oh, for you. Thank you. Um, you know the Shahrzad music? Of course, the Russian, Rimsky-Korsakov. Please, come in. Would you like some breakfast? Oh, no thank you. Please, have some breakfast with us. No, no, thank you. I just ate. You must have something. Maybe she's not hungry. No, no, no, it's Persian politesse, you must ask three times. Well, at least have some tea. This stuff's supposed to cure cancer. Oh, okay, thank you. You remind me of Hannah, a Persian student that I had. She had to flee Iran when she was eight with her whole family. She cried when they said she couldn't bring her piano. Oh. Oh, honey, time, the eggs. Oh, yeah. We like to soft boil our eggs to Tchaikovsky. Oh. Beautiful. So you just got here? Just arrived, tell us what's going on over there? Oh, it's bad. It's a big, open air prison. Everything is controlled by the government. Everyone must speak and behave the same way. Oh, that's crazy. Yes. You know the Book of Esther? I've always wanted to visit Persia. If you are an artist, you cannot live there. A woman has to where a hijab. Everyday you have to lie to yourself, lie to everyone. I could not sing in public. Sorry, but Iran is not Persia anymore. Well, you had a good teacher. I could learn more. Yeah, you are rushing it, so you can just take your time. Um, I play better when I sing also. You sing too? Yes. Oh, please, go on. Okay, um. Oh, hey, handsome, you want to water some plants or something? Yeah. What was that about? A poem, by Rumi. Oh, Rumi, I love Rumi. In fact, I had a book, where is it? Sebastian, I think, has my book. Can I play you a little something? Please. How did it go? What? Hey, how did it go? Good. Can I show you something? Come here. Come on. My parents. My madre in Spain. She wanted me to be born in Barcelona. Oh, what are you doing here? My dad was a, he was American. Born here, he worked for the UN, world agriculture. He, uh, well, he was killed. Sorry. On a UN mission up north near Iraq helping out farmers near your country, actually. Roadside bomb hit his car. I'm so sorry. Yeah, you know, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have... No, no, it's okay. My dad was also killed, Iran-Iraq war. Poison gas. That's horrible. I was small, I never knew him. Well, you recognize the landscape? Yes! Iran and Kurdish border. My dad, Sherco, his driver, and the little boy with the kite? That's you? This was the last time I saw him. Here, smell. Mmm, they smell so good. They do. Um, sorry, mom? But Ray keeps staring at me. Oh, he is harmless. He and his best friend were in an accident, were racing their bikes and his best friend fell and died. And Ray, hit his head on a rock and, um, was in a coma for a long, long time. We thought we had lost him. Be patient with our Ray, hmm? First his best friend died, then his dad. God bless his soul, but Ray adores Sean. It's like it's his dad. He will get used to you. Yes, these new jokes are off the freaking charts. Off the freaking charts? It means, killer jokes. Uh, how about piano? How about a piano? Just a small one. Maybe later I can teach children? Piano, it is. Stop. Stop. Sorry. I, the other day I shouldn't have. I'm... You don't know me, why you touch me? I'm sorry, I... Beautiful. What does it mean? Ghesmat. Destiny. Many Spanish songs about destino. Why they'd name you Sebastian? My dad. He loved Sebastian Bach. Listening to Sebastian Bach was the only way he could go to sleep. Bach music. So fatal. Who was that woman? What woman? The blonde? The one you drove in the car? Oh, Elana, your piano teacher. She was, she had her wig on. But, why were you kissing her? I thought she was your boss? Yeah, she is my boss. I I take her to a clinic once a week. She, uh, she has breast cancer, bad, ghesmat? Breast cancer? I am so sorry, I... She was a famous actress. She was in Salome's Kiss? Maybe you saw it? No, I must go back. "In your eyes I see the heavens, "in the heavens, I see your eyes." Is this the guy? Rumi? Hidden Music of Love? Yes. I only read a few poems about the sun, roses, wine, love. Very different than the Iran we see on TV. He wrote those 800 years ago. 800? Here. Listen to this. "After you, let dust "cover this world." Rumi? Yes. Why were you crying? Something happened back home. I wish you could read Rumi in Persian, then maybe you'd understand why sometimes I cry. Translating poetry's like... Kissing behind a glass window. Who told you that? Elana. You told her that. Yes. You're named after Sheherazade? Story teller of 1,001 Nights? The young princess who charmed the king and saved all the virgins from being beheaded? I don't deserve to be called Sheherazade. Why? Why do you say that? Honey? Anyone can teach you that, okay? I need more. This is about sadness, it's about passion, it's, just think about it. If you're listening to it, do you want to hear this? Okay, all the notes are there, the rhythm's correct. What about this? Mmm-hmm, yes. Okay, so I need you to try it again and this time I want you to pretend that I'm not here. Just you, okay? I try. Yes! That's Tchaikovsky. Yes, thank you. Oh, do you want to hear the music I was telling you about? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Oh God! Oh God! Oh no. Here. So sorry. Damn chemo. Did you know I was sick? Yes. I'm so sorry. I pray it goes away. I am sure it will go away. I've been fighting this for so long. I don't know. I... I have a big scar that will never go away. Oh honey. I'm so sorry. Oh. Relax. Breathe. Helps with the nausea. It's okay. Go, go, go, go, go! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh my God! Whoo! That was a beautiful game. Good game. - Good game. - Whoo! Let's celebrate, that's for you. Let's change channel. Today is the anniversary of the tragic murder of Neda Agha-Soltan Did you know her? No. I studied with her music teacher. We've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality of threats and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets. Protesting among thousands of peaceful opposition demonstrators, Soltan was shot dead by the Beseige, Iran's revolutionary guard. Today, Iran's oppressed women remain the unsung heroes of the opposition. Shahrzad? Hey, Sebastian? Good job. Thanks. Oh, take some roses for Elana. "After you, let dust cover this world." Sebastian? Are you awake? Rumi. Mmm, joonam, bless your sweet hands. Please hand me those devils. No. No, Maman jan. Sean will be here any minute. No tea, except in the morning. Well, it's morning in Tehran. Maman jan. No, no, no. Didn't we say no cigarettes and no tea except in the morning? Well, it's morning in Tehran. Shut up! Shut up, Ray! My God, what is with you, son? No smoking. No black tea, okay? Please, remember the doctor? Yes, yes. You know she had a heart attack? Oh God! Yeah. All right, here. One, nine, seven, nine. Bam, it opened. Mom's jewelry. You can put your jewelry here too, if you want. Is that real? The gun? Yeah. I love you, this is our home. I want to make sure you're safe. I gotta gig in New York City. You want to go? Yes, one day. I should stay to look after your mother. I know you've been talking to Sebastian and it's completely innocent, but, uh, he might misunderstand. Could you stop? It's a dream, shh. It's a dream, it's a dream, it's a dream, joon am. Ah! May they burn in hell. Oh, oh. Shh. Sorry, uh, please? Go on, aziz, and give him some roses for the piano teacher. Be careful with your bird. Next time the cat might eat it. You must train her to behave. "When love steals in your alley, he has no choice. "He longs to kiss every lock of your hair. "He has no choice." You taught Rumi to Parakeeta too? For Elana. "You are the rose. "I am the thorn. "Don't show your beauty without me." Rumi sounds strange in English. Seriously, my family doesn't like it I talk to men. Shahrzad, the phone! Meet me at the cliff tomorrow, please? Bravo! Wow, you were wonderful. Thank you. I'll get better once I get used to my new friend. Hi. May I show you my guitar? Yes. Is that your friend? The accident? Did, did you take that? Yeah. Sean says you play well. Not as well as you play the piano. Play more. I like it. You like my brother? Yes, of course. My husband. Shahrzad, Ray? Come down. You love him? Sherco, he taught me about kites when I visited my dad in Kurdistan. He got me that one at the airport the day I left. You know, green is the color of our freedom movement. Yeah, but Garcia Lorca was first. Who? Lorca, the Spanish poet. He wrote. "Green, "how I love you, green." Oh, there you are. Ray jan, are you okay? Hmm. Play me that Rumi song Shahrzad likes. It calms my heart. That is divine. I love you, mom. I love you, janam. You got it? Mmm-hmm. Here, let me take that. Why are your folks so, uh, I don't know? Suspicious? Is Sean your uncle? Um, no, he, uh... Sorry, excuse me. Salam? Oh, okay. Yes, on my way. Sorry, mom is sick, I have to go. Um, thank you for the book. Maman jan? Here. Take these. Ray-joon, please leave us. Shahrzad and I, we have woman talk. You okay? What is be to you and this Sebastian? Nothing. You're risking your life and all of this for a gardener? You're going to shame us all. Your poor mother. Maman jan, just someone to talk to. Azizam, do not fool yourself, or us. What if Sean finds out that you're still talking to this guy? Nothing will happen. What will happen if you run off with this Sebastian and then he, drops you, huh? Who do you turn to? Who will take you then, huh? Especially when they find out about your damage? Oh dear, I am sorry. You know are men. Who will marry a divorced woman, huh? Aziza, precious as my own daughter, promise me, heh? - You pro... - Maman jan? Maman jan? Maman jan? I promise, I promise, Maman jan. Ray! Ray, come, help! Maman jan, Maman jan, deep breath. Deep breath, you're doing okay, you're doing okay. Call 911, call the ambulance! Maman jan, breathe a little. Come on, come on, come on, Maman, breathe! Come on! Maman jan, breathe! Maman jan, breathe! Maman! Maman jan, breathe! Maman? Maman, maman? Breathe, Maman jan, breathe. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Sorry, I'll change it. No. You're not feeling sorry for me, are you? - No, I... - I know about you and Shahrzad. You think I don't recognize falling in love? Or out of it? I'm sick, but I'm still here. And I'm still me. We don't lie. I didn't know how, or what to tell you, I... I was going to. I am sorry. That's okay. I get it, just... you do what you need to do. But don't you hang around here because you pity me. Hello? Anyone? Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing, man? Please, don't hurt her? She flies off sometimes. She's a Chinese bird... Chinese, next time it'll be a dead bird. Here's your last freaking check. Don't ever come near this house again. Go! Go! Get out of here. My mother is the reason I'm here with you tonight. She is the one who encouraged me to choose comedy as a way of life and she taught me that comedy and tragedy are the yin and yang of life and no matter what, I always should laugh and cause laughter. Let's get this party going! Ray, hit it! Thank you, thank you very much! Give it up for my brother, Ray, everybody. Give it up. Nice. Now, I got to tell you, I'm very proud. I just married an Iranian woman. She's a great musician, she'a great singer. I actually bought her a piano. So I thought, "This will be great." But I'll tell you something, I'm actually losing my marriage to this piano. Straight up. The piano is taking over my life. The only time I catch her the most sensual moment of her being is with that frickin' piano. Sits there with her fingers just touching and caressing this piano. And I'm like, "God, I wish I was a piano." I thought you were joking. I thought I'd show you something. It's just outside, come on. No, I can't. I have to tell you something. You can tell me later. No, it's... See that red sign? Surprises, you'll love it. I can't. I swear by Rumi and all of his poems, we'll be back in time. It's kind of early, but you should see this place at midnight. People jump on the tables and have a good time. And other people, they think the word "complete" and "finish" are the same. No, no, no, no, they are very different. Especially when it comes to marriage. Watch, when you marry the right woman, you are complete. When you marry the wrong woman, you are finished! Dance? No. Come on. What? Your eyes, they're magical. My biggest night. Do you have any idea what I've been through to get up there? Hmm? And you were supposed to stay with me. Where were you? Sorry, I... I still have big headache. You care about me? Hmm? About my work? About us? I support your work, but you always come home late and sleep late. The times we are together, you never talk to me about what I like. My singing, music, you, you make jokes in public about my piano. Unbelievable. Shahrzad, that's just a freaking comedy. Are you kidding? I'm not even gonna go there. I'm never going back there either. Ever. Maman,. Have you been drinking? I will as soon as I get my papers, you shouldn't be drinking so much. Please, don't speak like that. Please, don't cry. Tomorrow, I'll see the lawyer, I will... Mama? Hello? Hello? What's wrong? I don't know. My accident. It's okay. I love you. Love? Love? Oh God, what am I doing here? Whoa, what is that supposed to mean, huh? Thank you. You want, I check? Yes. ICloud generates a map, shows you where you lost your iPhone. Awesome! Awesome. Where'd you learn that? All right, buddy, let's go. We'll be back before it gets dark. Okay, aza, call me if you need anything. See ya. Hi. Where'd they all go? Basketball game. Hop on. No, you crazy. I'm craz... didn't you want to tell me something? They will kill us. And according to Rumi, we'll end up in paradise. See the dolphins? Oh. Oh. Ah. So what can you not touch or see? It hits you like a light and lifts you up to heaven? God. No. It can leap from heart to heart, make you dance, laugh, or weep? Rumi? Love? Close, but no. It's music. - Music? - You tricked me! I didn't know you played. Just some Kurdish tunes Sherco taught me. Should have taken more lessons. No, you did very good. Shiraz, for Shahrzad, the young princess of 1,001 nights, seductive storyteller who told stories night after night so the angry king would not behead her like all the other virgins he slept with. Hell of a king. Only because his wife deceived him. So every night at dawn, Sheherazade would end on a cliff hanger so the angry king would save her to hear the end of the story. Sheherazade not only saved herself, saved all the other virgins too. I wish I could also save the other girls. Come on in, come on. What? Let's take a swim. Please, no I can't swim. You can swim on my back. No, no, no I can't, I can't. I'm married. What? What? I can't. Hey. Just a minute, honey. Where have you been? You don't answer your cell? You know my arm's dead. Couldn't get in, I had to use my left to turn the lock. I can't cook. I'm sorry, let's go to the clinic. In a minute. Okay. All right. Zani, watch the eighth notes, they're almost staccato. Okay? Try it. What's it? Go on. What is it? Go on. Sweet birds? We tried to find a for you that sings in Persian but they apparently just sing in Korean. Birds of paradise. Nice. Too fast. Okay. Help! You okay? Elana, Elana? Are you hungry? So pretty. You crazy? Sorry! Look what you did! If you ever touch me again, I tell Sean. How is she? Okay. I can't. You're married. I missed you, so much. Oh, thank you. I'l get it. Okay. When I dream, I don't have cancer. Isn't that cool? Your breath is where the love is. Up there on that cliff I watch the sun go down, and the stars come up. One by one, they're so sneaky. The breeze and the waves. It was all enough. That, that's, like Rumi says, "The ecstasy of the divine." It's beautiful. I've never asked you, how old are you? I'll be 23 in February. 23? You are so young. Listen to me, life is a gift, but youth is magic. I had my magic. Not even cancer can take that away. Don't waste it. Come here. You should be with Sebastian. I'm already married. I know. Thanks, hon. You're welcome. You know, by the way, you didn't miss much. Las Vegas should be renamed Las Losers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What happened? Speak to me. My mother, she passed away.. Oh God. Sorry, I'm so sorry. When? Last night, I tried to call her. She couldn't sleep. She wanted to... She wanted to. You're name and mine. Do you remember Rumi? "If you love yourself more than you love me..." "I died to myself..." "So I live only for you. "I love you, I love myself." But I am married. And you have to take care of poor Elana. Our ghesmat is not to be. Is someone watching us? Why didn't you tell me sooner? Didn't you notice my wedding ring? You have so many rings, how would I know? I wanted to tell you but, Elana, and everything happened so fast. Maybe it's my fate. An arranged marriage. No, no we knew each other when I was younger. I saw him on YouTube. I had to get out of Iran. Oh, so a convenient marriage? I understand. No, you don't understand. I am not perfect, I have a. Why the hell don't you answer your phone? Where were you? What do you even care? You don't even know me. You don't talk to me, or encourage. Encourage? Did I encourage you to run around with that frickin' Sebastian behind my back? If you ever speak to him again, both of you will be very sorry! You animal! Don't you ever lie to me! Don't you ever hit me again! Or what? You ungrateful woman. Did I not save you from the Imams? Did I not buy your own car, - your own piano? - Don't you ever hit me again, I will call the police. You are not to leave this house again without one of us. You want me to live here like I'm back home in prison. I will call the police. And then I will jump out the window! I'm sorry, Shahrzad, I'm sorry! What am I doing? Will you please forgive me? Shahrzad? Oh my God. Hey. Got a clean, oil, and check the gun now and then. Otherwise, it'll jam. I've got big headache. I'm going down to beach. Okay, Ray joon, go with her. Sorry. I need to be alone. Shahrzad! Shahrzad! "She dreams on her balcony "with eyes of cold silver. "Green, "how I love you, green." Awesome. You like Lorca? Mysterious. "The rose was not looking "for wisdom or for shadow, "the edge of flesh and dreaming." Are we dreaming? Don't know. But I know you smell like roses. Taste like wine. Maybe now with a little sea salt. It's my mother's. You're like the moon, adored by the stars. Thank you. Plus, we need to get you out of these wet things. Um... I have to tell you something. Back home. Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, ow, ow! I don't deserve to be called Sheherazade. You are Sheherazade. Shahrzad, I love you. I love you. Keep this for me. We gotta talk. Could I finish speaking to my mom? - Okay, see you upstairs? - Mmm-hmm. I can't, I can't live here anymore. He knows. Hey, do you see that? Oh. Tomorrow we'll be up there among the stars. I'm afraid to fly. "In our hearts tears and laughter "live side by side." Up there you can sleep as much as you want. Otherwise... Hi. No! Ray, Ray? I shot into the sky to frighten them. I know. I didn't mean to hurt anybody. I know, buddy, you wouldn't hurt a fly. Come on, Ray, give me the gun. No! Ray jan, Ray jan, let's not do anything to upset our mom. Give me the gun, Ray jan, please? No! No! How many times did I tell you? I didn't mean, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
