Attention, cars 9, 12 and 7 in the port area, emergency. In Via degli Orefici a man is shooting from a terrace. Help! Taking him alive would be suicide, you have to put him down. - Isn't there another way? - Why don't you send your men? - Let me give it a try. - Alright. Take cover! OK, if you're going to shoot, shoot. Got a match? Right now, Commissioner? Do you have to kill him right now? I received an order. Then I'll give you a new order: wait and warn the others. What's going on? Who is that? He's one of our officials. Let's wait before we shoot. Come on, let's go! Come on! Come on! If they find this stuff on you, they'll give you ten years. Let's go. You were lucky not to hurt anybody and to find a fool like me. You've got stronger fists than Cassius Clay. - Why, have you tried them? - No! So what do you know about them? It's the first one. Eh, it's the first one! Are you coming back with us, Chief? No, I'm going to walk, to unwind a bit. Cigarettes? Muratti? Marlboros? You can find everything you want! Assuntina has everything! Assuntina, the police is coming, from behind the alley. Buttons! Buy buttons! I have needles, webbing, everything you want! White buttons, red buttons, green, yellow! Get them! Brigadier, would you like some socks for your wife? Cigarettes! Cigarettes! - Commissioner, may I have a word? - Go ahead. They want to steal the jewels of the Madonna of Piedigrotta. - It's not my area. - Then who do I tell? - Tell it to the priest of the parish. - The priests don't pay. Let's hear it, out with the names. You want to know too much. I need the money first. - Get busy and be careful. - Thanks, Chief. Good morning, Commissioner. No news. - Caputo, give me a cigarette. - Another? - Yes. Two in an hour? At this rate... Caputo, whose cigarettes are they? Yours, but you told me to give you 2 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon. Then I won't smoke! What can I do? You're the one who said smokers are fools. Then I am a fool. By the way, the chief wants to talk to you urgently. You're a fool too, huh? No, I'm a brigadier. Here is our deputy commissioner, Rizzo, known as Flatfoot. - Mr. Tabassi is from Milan. - Pleased to meet you. Mr. Tabassi takes my place. That's right, Rizzo. As of tomorrow, we're separating. After so many years, I'm going to a more peaceful place, thank God. I heard about what you did today. Congratulations, you showed courage. Can I ask you something? Were you armed? Sure, with this. Isn't that reckless? I prefer my men having the means to defend themselves. I defend myself well even without a gun. Flatfoot has his ways. He goes around like the English policemen, but he can throw a punch! Yes, yes. I've heard about that. But we must impose the force of the law, not that of our fists. You don't believe in guns. Well, I hope you believe in the law. Sure, but... here in Naples, the law isn't easy to enforce. The law has no use for lowlifes. Out of the way! Let me through! Well? Shall we play with sharpeners? Where are you going? - Chief, who'll pay for the damages? - Wait. Half-hand, you play with children now? What have we come to? I always mind my own business, but nobody has to step on my toes. - Who will pay for the damages? - Wait! No one got hurt, it seems. If I report you, I'll do the paperwork and they'll be free in an hour. We'll pretend that nothing happened. And Half-hand will pay the damages. Is that alright? Come on! Let's go! Move it! Out! We've never seen anything like this in this city! Four kids raise their hands on a camorra leader. Has the revolution broken out? Mom, hurry up. If he doesn't eat, he'll die. It's ready. Here. Good morning, Commissioner! He's coming. Come on! Come on, quick! Wait a sec. Hurry up! What's up? Were you waiting for me? Flatfoot, don't you keep track of time? The pasta is cold. Keep track of time? I've been living here for ten years, and now you tell me I don't keep track of time? Plus, I like my pasta cold. - Hi, Flatfoot. - Hi. Maria, do me a favor. You're watching your weight, I'm not. Be patient. - Enough? - Enough, enough. Salvatore, I'd like to know what you did today. I'll tell you. You must have gotten into trouble. You are lucky you're not my son. Flatfoot! Do you remember Gennarino the Rabbit? I saw him, he sends his regards. He better behave. You have no heart. He steals because he has 10 kids to feed. What else can he do? Right, because stealing is the only way to make a living. Who is it? Good morning, ma’am. - Good morning, Mr. Commissioner! - Good morning. What's up? Excuse us, but we received a report. A wanted man was seen entering this building. So we're checking the apartments. There's no wanted person here. Thank you, Commissioner and sorry to disturb you. Good day. Good day. Gennarino! Good morning, Chief. Come in. Chief, good morning. I think you're all trying to ruin me! Didn't you see the police? He's wanted. So what, must he hide here? What's my job, huh? - Commissioner. - Of public safety! Enough! Now you're exaggerating! Take this poor wretch to jail, wouldn't that make you happy? No, because then I'll end up in jail, not this poor wretch! What are you standing there for? I have ten kids to feed. So you need to refuel for them too. Go ahead, sit down. What else did you steal today? I stole... I stole two tires, with no thread and inner tubes! What a pathetic thief! You're a thief and also a fool. It was the merchandise on display. You're turning yourself in after this meal. Then why didn't you let the police take me earlier? First, because I didn't know you're here. And second, you get treated better if you turn yourself in. Alright, Chief, I'll do whatever you want. I'll turn myself in, after the coffee, if I may. It's very sharp now. Good job. Let me see. No! No, leave me! Leave me alone! Stay still! So, are you going to talk? I don't know them, I've never seen them. Just leave me alone. Mr. Commissioner, would you like company? Carmen, don't be funny. You know why I'm here. I don't have anything to say. You are Marta's only friend. Do you want to end up like her with a scarred face? Commissioner, I'm afraid. Who are you afraid of? You see... everything used to be normal. Now they want us to do certain things... Who's making you do certain things? I ask you for the good of my son, leave me alone. At least tell me who scarred that poor girl. It was Ferdinando, the Baron. - It's a little wide. - No, you look great, Baron. Now let's measure another one. This one is perfect. Here, Mr. Baron. - Isn't it dark? - Midnight blue, for lovers. - You think? - Yes. - What do you think? - It's perfect, wonderful! See how well it fits? - Do I look good? - Even the mirror says so! It just can't talk! - Doesn't he look like a model? - He's a beauty! - How many shall we make? - As many as you want, Mr. Baron. Let's make 12. So, with the linen ones we'll make three dozen. - You think it's enough? - For now, then we'll see. Does the color suit the skin? It's a perfect match! Alright. Now that we've worked, let's have some fun. Hey, Commissioner! Would you like to join us? Give the commissioner a drink. I need your help. Shall we talk? Now? Does this seem like a good time? Let's do it tomorrow, huh? I'll be right there, Commissioner. Baron, tell me how you scarred Marta the Calabrese. The Calabrese? What's it got to do with me? A lot. Chief, who told you this slander? You don't believe me, huh? Let me confront her. It's my business who told me that. Do you want to end the night in jail? As you prefer. If you want to make a bad impression. Right. The person who spoke would take it all back out of fear. The evidence is not there, a lawyer comes in and does the rest. - I must also apologize to you. - Let's drop the apology. Let's just pretend it was a joke and forget all about it. Do you need a ride? Did you inherit it? Three months ago you were starving. How much does this car cost? A trifle. 14 million, without the accessories. Is this also an accessory? Of course. How much does it cost? 800,000 lire? This mirror? Hey, Chief! Are you crazy? What a beautiful glass! It broke! Don't think I'm scared of you, just cause you're bigger than me. I'm bigger than you? Did that poor girl look big? You sent four men! What is it? I asked for the file! Go get it. - You sent for me? - Come in, Rizzo. I must talk to you. Take a seat. Let's talk about your work. You investigate, arrest, release, without ever reporting to me. Who's in charge here, me or you? Commissioner, you are in charge, but you're new here and I know the city better than my own pocket. You don't approve my connections with the camorrists, but this city is special, and our parish is even more special. With my methods, I've obtained that things go smoothly in this area. Have you noticed that no one kills around here? You say I'm violent, alright, sometimes I am. But these people don't know any other language. And you do? I can explain myself very well, even without a gun. As long as you're not in trouble. Come in. Chief, there was a shooting in the harbor. Sabatini is slightly wounded. We took him to the hospital. So "no one gets killed around here"? He said "slightly wounded". We need to look for Half-hand, he and Sabatini argued the other day. Who is Half-hand? Tonino Percuoco, a camorra boss. I'll go see what is going on. No Rizzo! Have a car ready. I'll go get him. Yes, sir. But Half-hand doesn't know you! What does it take to arrest a camorrist? A letter of recommendation? He lives at Piazza delle Vergini 12, second floor, apartment 4. This man knows what he is doing! - Do you know what he is doing? - No. - So? - Everyone knows what they are doing. Russian watches, little machines! Bug to Jasmine, answer. This is Jasmine, over. Attention, police car in the direction of Sanità. Spread the word, over and out. Ammacchiato has to go, it's about to rain! Ammacchiato has got to go, it's about to rain! Ammacchiato must leave because it's raining! Ammacchiato must leave because it's raining! Alright, keep me informed. Commissioner, it's this way. Alright. So? Rizzo, have the phonograms mailed immediately. That son of a bitch is gone. Yes, alright, nobody touches you, just come down here ASAP. Take care. Who were you talking to? With Antonino Percuoco, Half-hand. I was talking him into turning in. What? Please, elaborate. Half-hand is a camorra boss. He is not an ordinary criminal. He'd never let himself be caught in front of everyone like a thief. And what must we do to have the honor of questioning him? - Nothing, he's on his way. - Chief! Chief, may I have a word? - What do you want? - It's important. A robbery is imminent at the Commercial Bank in Piazza Mercato. Alright, here, go now. I'm busy. Take care. I don't mean to be nosy, but... Who is that? What's this about a robbery? He makes up a lot of nonsense. And you pay him? - He's a friend. - What does that mean? A friend who brings good luck. Rizzo, don't tell me you believe in these things! Come in! Mr. Tabassi, I found these glasses, they say they're yours. See you. What did I tell you? He brings good luck. Hello. Yes, right away. It's the lawyer. So? He's at the Commissariat. Don't worry, he's not talking. So why did you shoot him? How can you ask me that? I didn't shoot anybody! Then why did they want to kill you the other day at the pizzeria? Why don't you ask them? I'm questioning you! Listen carefully, Half-hand. We get along fine, you on one side, me on the other side of the fence. If you want to remain friends... I didn't forget that you saved my life, but I'm a man of honor. Is Ferdinando the Baron too? He's just a cardboard mobster. Right. He has a 14 million car and a ring worth just as much. If his girls don't obey, he has their faces slashed. If he has to settle a score with you, he sends his boys! Those from the other day were his men. And instead of going after the Baron, you shoot his men! - That's a cardboard mobster? - I've already told you what I think! Alright, as you wish. But don't assume I'm blind to what goes on in the city. There's been a lot of money floating around, too much. And that generally means only one thing: drugs! That wretch had her face cut up because she refused to push drugs! Chief, my hands are clean of that stuff. I'm not accusing you, but be sure that I'll find out. Caputo, prepare the charge. You can go. What if the chief wants to interrogate him? Shut up, it's already hot in here! And give me a cigarette. Take care, Half-hand. With this one, you've smoked tomorrow's as well. There he is. So? We think it was a sunstroke. Well... then we think so too. - How are you? - Fine, thank you. I heard you're on your way out. I've done everything to keep you from going on trial. Very kind. I don't forget. Yes, very well. Now, I need you to do me a little favor. Remember that stuff you had on you? Joe, the drugs. Where did you get that? On board, like everybody else. Those who gave it to you, what kind of people are they? I don't know much about it. It's a business I'm not familiar with. In the city there are people who sell that stuff to sailors. But those sellers, are they American or what? Not Americans. That stuff doesn't come from the States, it's different. Now that I think about it, there's an Italian-American... He knows everything about it, he's in the business. Can you tell me the name? Ferra... Ferramenti! - Tom Ferramenti! - Yeah, that's it! Thank you. Tom, you realize what kind of trouble you're in? Look here. Dollars, brass knuckles, knife, rings. As much as it hurts me, I have to report you. With your record you'll end up at the border, Tom. Commissioner, I'll tell you anything you want, but please remove... - The foot? - Yes. No, the foot is fine there. Who's bringing the drugs in? Are they Americans? No, they're not Americans. Where are they from? They're from Marseilles. Continue. In Marseilles, they were fucked. So they decided on a change of scenery. The foot, Tom? It's fine where it is. We were talking about the Marseillais. Talk, I'm interested. Leave my friend alone. Excuse me, I'm busy right now. So, the Marseillais? They bought half the Camorra to organize their traffic. Amigo, you don't get it. Forget about Tom Ferramenti. Yeah, later. - We'd better call the police! - But Flatfoot is already here. Exactly! Running away? Come here. We were having a nice conversation. So, Tom. How do the Marseillais operate? How do the drugs get in, who distributes, who gets it? You wanna know too much. I told you what I knew. Tom, look. Should I go tell the boss of Chiatamone that your spying sent his sons to jails? So? So... every day... the stuff is delivered to Mergellina. - Where to? - The restaurant "Carminiello a Mare". Who brings it? Who receives it? I don't know that. Try to remember, Tom. Try to remember! Are you going to talk or not? So? Ferdinando! Look at this, it's about to be grilled. Is it good? Put it aside for me. Will do! Cheers! What's going on? You scared me! - Move over! Police. - Don't push me! - Outrageous! - Shut up! Listen, this is police brutality! How do I know you're a police officer? You're not wearing a uniform! Why, do you have one? That's the last straw! Easy, it's brand new! Stop! Stop! What are you doing? Are you crazy? You threw out Bambi? Shut up or I'll throw you out too! Please, calm down. Help! My God, be careful! You'll give me a heart attack! Shut up or I'll arrest you for cackling! Mamma mia! Who would've imagined... Now what? - Oh, it was you! - Quick, get out! Having fun racing, huh? Turn around! Where's the stuff? - Where'd you put it? - What stuff? - Did this tear itself? - It was an accident. What accident? Come on! Let's go to the station! Sit down, it's quieter here. So, Baron, do we want to talk about drugs? What drugs are you talking about? The one you were supposed to deliver to Carminiello's restaurant. - Deliver to whom? - That's what you gotta tell me. Commissioner... First you accused me of disfiguring a prostitute, and now of dealing drugs. It's persecution! Baron, you're screwed. - The sooner you talk, the better. - About what? "About what?" Tell me who gives you orders! Who pays you to sell the stuff all over Naples! - My hands go off by themselves! - Enough, Rizzo! See, Commissioner? You can see for yourself. Rizzo... What are you doing? I was talking to Ferdinando the Baron. Morning Counsel. Counsel De Ribis is representing Mr. Scarano. Counsel De Ribis. The famous lawyer? Baron, have you turned to the dark side? Save your jokes, Commissioner. Rizzo, there is a formal complaint filed by the attorney against you. Fifteen days ago you mistreated Mr. Scarano causing him injury. Doesn't the complaint also say that he had disfigured a poor girl? Commissioner, I remind you that slander is still a crime. Does he have proof? Counsel, you have filed the complaint, Let me establish the facts. - Your client can go with you. - Fine, Commissioner. No further requests. I'm only here out of respect for you, otherwise I would've turned to the judge. Mr. Scarano must remain available, of course. Of course. Come on. Let's go. Are you happy now? Not as happy as you! You made me lose a criminal about to talk. Perhaps after a few punches! You know I don't condone certain methods. You use yours, I have mine. Next time I'll put the handcuffs on that Mr. Scarano, he'll never get out of jail! You won't handcuff anybody. Give me the badge. You are suspended from service. The gun. What gun? Consider yourself lucky, if I don't lock you up for what you've done. - I need to talk to you, Chief. - Get out of my way, you're bad luck! Sorry, Peppino, it's not your fault, but I'm having a bad day. Thank you, Chief. Grace be with you. What is it? I've brought back your son. He's not well. Oh my God! Salvatore! What did he do? I don't know, ma'am. He felt sick in class. Commissioner, please! - What happened? - Look how pale he is! - He got sick at school. - It's nothing. Do something, for the love of God! Let's call a doctor! Salvatore! Salvatore! No doctor needed. What is that? "What is that?" Give me that stuff! Open the book, come on! Go, you wretches! There's never been a drug trade on such a large scale in Naples before. You know it better than me. That's why the Marseillais came here. Because they needed fresh territory. If we don't stop them, this city will become hell. I don't need to explain to you what the drugs bring with them. There will be rival gang fights, settling of scores, blood on the streets... Not to mention the consequences for young people. I told you what happens around schools. Thank you for the information, my people will investigate. - Is that all you have to tell me? - No! I have something else to tell you. If you want to act on your own, forget about it. You are suspended from duty, remember that. Don't worry, I won't forget! - Room 24? - Right over there. Don't turn around. Sit down. Things are going badly. We're not happy with you, Mr. Scarano. - But... - Don't turn around. In 3 months, there have been no concrete results. We didn't give you protection and money, so you can live the good life. Wait a minute, it's not easy to sell that stuff. This is a peculiar city, only the kids respond well, but you wanted to give it to them for free. We gave it away for free to help them get addicted. Now that they're waiting for you, you can sell it to them as well. You'd be surprised. You've no idea how much money can be made from these kids. I know that very well. Give me time and I will make Vesuvius smoke again. - Try to understand... - I only understand results! You have only cost us so far. - Start making money! - I have always made... Thank you, sir. Good morning, Commissioner. The one dressed in brown who just came out, who did he meet? The one with the red Lamborghini. He went up to 24. - Check who it is. - It's a suite. It's an empty apartment. In fact, the key is here. We're sorry. I understand. - How is it possible? - What is this about the 24? - He asked me. - What does he want? - Did you call for me? - Yes. Shall we sit down? - Would you like something? - I don't drink. I heard... and I'm sorry. I didn't imagine that my complaint would bring you such drastic consequences. Is that why you called me? I called you to tell you that everything can be fixed. In what way? Well... If my client withdraws the complaint and I say the right words to the right people, you'd be back in service from evening to morning. From evening to morning? Exactly. And what do I have to do in return? Absolutely nothing. You mean "nothing more." Good, you said it. You are very sharp, Chief! I'd like to know one thing. Do you have the police in hand? Flatfoot... May I call you that? Politics rules, the police... - obeys. Is that clear? - Of course. So, what's you answer? Look, after all you've told me... Do you know Ferdinando the Baron? Sure, my client. What about him? Give him a message from me. Sure, gladly. Tell him that when I see him, sooner or later, I'll break his ass! I don't understand why you do this to me. Why take 10,000 liras? I've always given you everything I could. We discussed together the things you wanted. I know why you got them, but I want you to tell me. I won't tell your mother, it would cause her too much pain, but tell me why you took this money. I don't have to! You're not my father! I'm not your father, huh? They knocked! Who could it be at this hour? Flatfoot... forgive me. Chief, we come on behalf of Ferdinando the Baron! He asked us to say hello! The Baron is worried for your health! He wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you. He advises you not to get involved, understand? Do you understand, Chief? This time, we'll just have some fun! - I've come to give you a hand. - To give what? - A hand. - Give me a hand! Jesus! Have we lost our minds? This is unheard of! Now we're cooperating with the police! Who do you take us for? Wait a second! I know you well. I can tell you without a doubt that you all live outside the law. In fact, you live by making a mockery of the law. No offense to anybody, Chief. No offense. I believe none of you have ever dealt drugs. - Am I right? - Right. Now that the Marseillais are here, there's no saving your business. The camorra has split in half and many young people have already gone to work for them. The worst criminals of Africa, America and Europe will come here. Cops will come like flies and Interpol will be unleashed. If you don't intervene now, you of the old camorra, you're finished, closed definitively! And you won't be useful to them, for they already have minions. I get it, you think it's a joke. One moment, gentlemen. Let's think before making a decision. Firstly, Commissioner Rizzo is no longer a police officer. Secondly, the things he said are true. They are serious things. Third, he is a man of honor, and many of you know it. Is it true? Sooner or later we have to meet them. In my opinion it's better to do it now. Alright. Agreed. But remember, we only do it for our own sake, not for the benefit of the law. Because whether or not they work for the police, cops always make us sick! No offense to anyone. No offense! I've been saying for half an hour that we were too heavy! Now tell me where are the labs that manufacture this filth! Break everything! Everything went according to plan. We hit them where it hurts, and the guys did a good job. - Where are you going? - Leave him alone. What's up? Two men came saying the Baron wants to talk to you. Alright, go home. Gentlemen. Chief, he took the bait. - Bye, Half-hand. - And what will you do? I'm going. Chief! My being here was supposed to be a secret. - What do you want? - Something important to tell you. What's up? - That stuff's coming up. - What stuff? Drugs... a million dollars worth of drugs. When? Tomorrow, a ship from Tunis. Tunis? Who told you that? Chief, the message is important, not the messenger. Peppino, I don't have any money. I'll give it to you tomorrow. No worries, I'll eat tomorrow! Here I am, Baron. They killed him to teach others a lesson. He wasn't doing a good job. The Marseillais don't mess around. They wanted to kill two birds with one stone, him and me. It was a successful plan, Ferdinando the Baron assassinated and Commissioner Rizzo arrested by the police. What do we do now? You guys do nothing. It's all on me now. I'll have all the police after me and before I get them off my back... The police? Why? Because they know that Ferdinando the Baron and I didn't get along. Everybody knows, even the police. This is my stop. If you need help, you know where to find me. Thank you. Bye. Good morning. A cigarette? - Have you come to arrest me? - No, the commissioner wants you. Too many strange things have happened lately in your sphere of influence. This town is beset by clashes between rival gangs. I think you're in it up to the neck. I warned you that hell was breaking loose. You didn't listen to me and now it's not my problem. Answer my question! I'll answer like the laywer: Do you have proof? Bear in mind, you're still an official of public safety, even though you're suspended. Tell me everything you know. You must cooperate whether you want to or not! I don't want to. Want me to report you for criminal conspiracy? You need to clarify your position regarding Scarano's murder. Were you involved in his murder, yes or no? I'll send you to jail! There's been a homocide in Mergellina, they killed Peppino the Hunchback. Come. - Who found him? - A fisherman. A gunshot wound to the heart. We didn't touch anything, but many people came in. Forensics is on the job. - Where is the medical examiner? - We called him. - Where is he? - He's coming now! Know what it means when they shoot someone and then cover his mouth? - Was he talking too much? - Yeah. Don't worry, these things are decided by the judge. Have you asked if anyone around here heard gunshots? - We were thinking... - Let's not waste time hypothesizing! No ships are arriving today from Tunis. Believe me, any kind of ship... yachts, fishing boats, they always give us advance notice. Not like the past when... Commissioner! Peppino, were you talking nonsense again? What? Mind your business! "Tunis" the boat! Do you get it? Who's the nutjob? Hello, Port Authority. Hello. Hello. Hello! Hello! You're a cuck! I just boarded. All good. Thank you for your help. - Where are you headed now? - Drinking. Wanna join? No, you guys are coming with me, on my yacht. Listen. The yacht is not really mine. Tonight I have to go on board to see certain things. Maybe you can... We're sending the little one home, right? Don't worry, he's okay. Let's pretend we're drunk. Easy. Do you know where the stuff is? No, we have to look for it. Easy. Get him! No, not the beard! Not the beard! Leave the beard! Not the beard! No! Not the beard... The drugs are in the fish! Easy, Counsel. I've come only for legal advice. You could have said that right away. That's fine with me. As long as it doesn't conflict with other cases of mine. It's just a matter concerning a friend of mine. Did he commit a crime? Yes and no. He took... a shipment of drugs intended for others. A friend of yours? In my opinion... he'd better return the goods to the rightful owners. That way... he might... even get a reward. And do you know the legitimate owners? Well, a firm like mine... is like a port. Sooner or later everyone passes through it. Well, tell your friends that if they want me, they know where to find me. I was just looking for you. Let's sit in the back. I heard what you did at the harbor. What nonsense are you up to? Even I can't help you now. Are you talking about this stuff? What are you worried about? I'm no fool. As long as only I know where the loot is, I live in peace and get some satisfaction. What do you mean? What satisfaction? The first and biggest one is to see dead whoever killed the Hunchback. He's a dead man, Tonino. Why? Why is he a dead man? It's simple. It's the same person who wanted the stuff I got. The Marseillais don't forgive someone who let a million dollars slip away. And you know who it is? It was you. What? Who told you this nonsense? The Hunchback. The Hunchback? What, did you dream about him last night? And he gave you numbers for the Lotto? Do you know how the Hunchback died? He died with his hands like this! To signal to me who killed him. It was the last spy job he did for me. Good job! Bravo, Flatfoot the Cop. You know a lot, huh? You can never know enough! If I had predicted that you wanted the Baron's place, the Hunchback would be alive! You took his place, didn't you? You'll end up the same way. What are you going to do? Kill me? I don't get my hands dirty with scum like you. The Marseillais will take care of it, they know their business well. What if I kill you? Go ahead and shoot. You'll lose your only chance of staying alive. Only I know where the drugs are. Only I can put the Marseillais with their backs against the wall. I'm like your insurance policy, but alive. Makes sense, doesn't it? You're right. I need you alive. Guys, take him away and make him talk. Bravo, Caputo, arrest these lowlifes. I'm sorry, Chief, I've come to arrest you. "Whoever, without authorization, manufactures, sells," "distributes, purchases, finds transports, imports, exports," "or unlawfully possesses narcotic substances" "or psychotropic or similar substances..." Rizzo, you face a sentence of 7 to 15 years. But it gets worse, two murders to explain, Rizzo! Someone saw a big man with a beard leaving Scarano's house. Someone who looks like you. I have a theory about the murder of the Hunchback. So, he gave you the information about the drugs at the port. He wanted to share the loot, isn't it so? And instead, you killed him! Lucky you that you have a theory! Because I don't understand anything. Too many strange things have happened. I'm about to make Ferdinando the Baron talk, you come and the young gentleman is free to go. I'm telling you that they're infesting the schools of Naples with drugs and you tell me not to pry. Half-hand is cornered and you send Caputo to arrest me. What don't you understand? I don't get whose side you're on. What are you insinuating? I don't want to insinuate anything, it's just that I don't understand. And when Flatfoot doesn't understand, know what he does? The boss doesn't want to be disturbed at least for an hour, you can go. What's going on? You've always said that the gun only brings trouble. There are some troubles that can't be solved with your hands. What do you have to do? Don't risk it, please. It's time to find out the truth. Whether or not the commissioner is colluding with the Marseillais. Whatever it takes. Chief, may I leave? No, Gennarino. Don't move for any reason until I come back. And if you see those over there... understand? Shoot. Shoot? Chief... I've always been a thief and in my free time I've also had ten children. But this thing in my hand... Gennarino... Shoot in the air, on the ground, make a noise, call people, but don't move from here. Put the commissioner on the phone. Sir, it's Rizzo. Let me speak... Yes, I made a mistake. But I didn't want to go to jail. I don't feel like coming there to get handcuffed in front of everyone. I have the stuff with me, and I'd like you to come alone in 2 hours, to Piazza dei Miracoli. As you can see, I keep my word. Here's a million dollars worth of drugs. 350 years worth of salary including benefits. Quite tempting, isn't it? I bet it's Half-hand. He must've come to recover the drugs or else the Marseillais will kill him. That wouldn't surprise you, would it? You're crazy. I'm not crazy, I'm curious. Now we'll know the truth. Either you and Half-hand are in business and you told him about our meeting or Half-hand is here because he followed me. In which case, you're honest. And if you're smart, you didn't come alone. Put your hands up and don't move, or you'll come under fire! It's really him, huh? Don't move. Get your hands up! If you make a move, you're both dead. Leave the bag where it is, and step back. Drop your weapons and raise your hands! You're surrounded, drop your weapons! Surrender! Surrender! You're surrounded, surrender! There's no escape! Surrender! Don't force us to shoot. Drop the weapons. Final warning! I'm no fool, you see? I predicted everything. I needed you as bait. Drop the gun, Half-hand! In that bag, there's not an ounce of dope. See, doctor? I'm no fool either. Go, run! Stop! Chief! Chief! We got almost all of them. Some escaped from there. We'll get them, come with me. Where are we going? We don't know their hideout. They must have taken refuge in some cave. Naples has 20 kilometers of caves! Where are you going? It's a dead end! This way to Posillipo! This way! You won't get out of here alive. And you'll get out alive because I'll to send you to jail! Excuse us, ma'am, but we're still looking for that convict. What is it, Brigadier? Good morning, Commissioner. We're a bit busy because last night that convict was seen down in the lobby, armed. Yes, but there's no one here. You can go. Excuse me, Mr. Commissioner. Goodbye. Chief! They're good, but a little overcooked.
