Get up, get up! - No! - Come here. Let go of him! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up. Stay dead. Stay dead. - Leave him alone! - Shut the fuck up! No, no, no. Please, not my baby! Not my baby. Please. Get the fuck down! Shut the fuck up. You want to be a fucking hero? Stay the fuck down. What are you... Oh! Goddamn it! What the fuck... put pressure on it. I fucking am! Jesus fucking Christ! Hold still! Fuck! Are you running off, aye? That wife of yours, can you hear her? She ain't screaming no more. And her belly, how far along was she? You've already made you choice. Now follow through with it. Ken's bleeding pretty bad. We gotta go. Alright. Well... This is it, my friend. I hope being a hero meant everything to you. But to me, I ain't mad at what you did. You're just in my fucking way. No! No, no, no, no. I see what you are doing, you filthy minger. You keep those dirty shoes out of here. What? - They are clean. - No, no, no. You're not coming in here with those. Last time I was cleaning mud out of the carpet for over a week. I'm not having it, never again. I was just going to get some water. Oh, really. In that case, you can wait out here and I'll bring you some. Tom failed me. Okay, that sounds good. Did they give you a time table? Kids, give me a hand, can you? That's unacceptable. No, no, no... - I got it, Mom. - Oh, thanks honey. - Mr. Henderson. - We have to get back on schedule. We need to fire him fast. Thanks, Peter. - Hello, Peter. - Hello, Mrs. Henderson. Please, call me Lauren. I don't want home to feel like my work. - You know what I mean? - Okay. Thank you, Peter. My pleasure. Nice sweater. Oh, thank you. 'Tis the season for ugly sweaters and silly hats, right? Ugly? Hey, Justin, you need help? - Uh, no. I got them. - Sure. - Okay, boy. - I'm good. No, no, no. I spent all day cleaning in here. You put those in the back room with the others. Are you sure? I think this is fine. - No, no. Out now. - Okay... Love you. Thank you. Bullshit, Mark. You tell them that they need to deliver on time, or I will shank each and every one of those bastards. Oh, swear I will, Tom. I am done with it. Just get them back in line. You hear me? Call me when it's finished. So? Stephen, talk to me. How bad is it? Are we ruined? Hey, you will not ignore me here. Oh, shut up Lauren. Can't you see I'm taking care of things? I don't need you butting in when you don't understand the situation or how to deal with it. I do. Just let me fix this, hm? I have a right to know what's going on here. We moved our whole family here for your job. What happens with it impacts on all of us. Come on, it doesn't matter. The kids are almost gone anyway. They're gonna be making their own decisions - and fucking their own lives up... - Oh, Stephen, stop it. Why don't you come with me? You're leaving? No. I put the twinkly lights on the fence. What's the point? It's pretty. We're in the middle of the country. Look, no one even drives past here. No one's gonna see it. Maybe not. But we will see. Hm? The yelling never stops. Like clockwork. I'm so over this. Just one more day, then you will be with me. Yeah, but then that's one night and then I have to come back to this shit. I know. Do they know you're spending the night with me? - No. - Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, they have no idea what I'm doing, or care. At least I love you. Mrs. Henderson. I am done. I go now unless you need something. Um, no Francesca, I think we're okay, thank you. Okay, miss. I be here tomorrow. Oh, wait, um, maybe you could help Peter with the Christmas lights outside? I don't work in the yard. Oh, thank you. Your family finished Christmas shopping? Uh, yeah, yeah. I think we're done. Good. It's good to be able to enjoy time together with family, yeah? I guess. Hm? Not bad. Is that all of it? Oh, no. Just first bunch. Come. Goodbye. No going in the house with those shoes. Either of you. I'm not having it. I'm just not having it. Okay, goodbye, Francesca. Bye. The maid is late today. I do hate tardiness. But I've been assured that she's generally like clockwork. In at seven in the morning out by three in the afternoon on the dot. She better keep to her schedule tomorrow. Don't matter. She'll be long gone by the time we get there. There will be no one there. Like last time? Piss off. Wasn't my fault. Fine. Like nothing ever is. Hey, shut it. Would you two stop bickering like a couple of amateurs? The maid will be gone. And the family will be gone. You get in, you get the stuff I tell you to and you get out. Job's clean and simple. As long as you two don't fuck it up again. - Look, I had to do something. - I don't give a toss. You go in with mask and gloves in case there's any security cameras. I don't want another blood bath on my hands. Don't have him killing everyone again then. What was I supposed to do? Leave witnesses? Not after what you did last time. You can't leave no one left alive to point a finger. Hey, are you two fucking deaf? I said there won't be anyone there. So there's no killing families this time, alright? That's not the job. I want two of on the first floor covering the entrance and exits. Two of you on the second floor looking for the gear. I have business to take care of at same time as the job. But I won't be far. So if there is any trouble, just call me. - I'll bring my garrote this time. - The fuck you will. Didn't you just hear what the governor said? No killing, moron. You just do as you're told. I don't want any more cockups. You screw this up, then you're off the crew. I think you both know what that means. Like the boss said, "No killing." Alright, let's get out of here. We'll drive the exit route one more time just to make sure there's no surprises. Didn't know you decorated the place. Nice, yes? Yeah. It's a... Must have taken a lot of time, huh? Some, yes. I, a... Um, if you don't mind my asking, uh, why? Why did you do it? It just a... you take the time to-to do something like this, all the hours, all the care, but no one's ever gonna see it. In a month all will be done. Clean up and put away. But I won't forget this memory. Christmas, twinkly lights, little Santa... makes for pretty memories. When you get older, sometimes all you have is memory. It's worth the effort. So with all this here, you staying for Christmas? You're not going to visit your family? I haven't seen my parents since war. No other family? No. I'm sorry, uh... You said a war. What war? What happened? Some memories are best forgotten. Dad, can you pass the salt? Honey, did you pack for tomorrow yet? Hm? Oh, no, I'm not gonna go. What? But the lodge has been booked for months. It's already paid for. - I know. - But you were excited about it. I know. I'm still gonna go. I just don't want to go right now. I mean, I'm gonna go just see Tina and Cheryl. You never said anything about this. Well, it's 'cause we just decided it. We're going to go to the theater, and then maybe get some tapas, and then crash at Cheryl's. What movie? Um, I can't remember the name. It's, um... It was something Cheryl picked out. Some kind of horror movie about a killer clown or something. I don't like you doing this at the last minute. Well, I will be back the next day. Hannah, its rude to change plans like that. This trip was a chance to spend time together as a family. We've been looking forward to it for a while now. You've been looking forward to it. Hannah! Go ahead and go. I don't think there's a problem with spending the night with her friends tomorrow. See, no big deal. I'm done. Goodnight. Are we good? Are you spending the night at my place tomorrow? Yeah. It's just you and me, babe. Awesome. Good night, hon. You never... You never properly listen to me. - You all... - For God's sake. What? What? For God sake... This is what I'm saying. - When do I not listen? - You never do. I'm trying to put my point across and you just kind of... What the fuck am I doing?! That's what I'm asking, what the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? This is a whole new level. A whole new level. This is unacceptable. Why would you do that? Hannah's 18, she can do what she wants. Ever since we moved from Phoenix, things have turned to shit. This trip was important for all of us. Forcing the kids to do something they don't want wanna do is not gonna help anyone. I was just trying to do something for our family, Stephen. I never thought that would mean so little to you. Maybe we should cancel, get a refund. No. We're still going. We need the money. It's the smart thing to do. I will call them in the morning... I can't believe you're so fucking hypocritical. One moment you want this trip as a Hail Mary to keep the family happy. The next, "Screw it," you just want some money back. We'll save the money. Do something at home, it's fine. - No, we're leaving. - Stephen. - I'm the man of the house, this is my decision. - Excuse me?! Good night, Mom. Do you think they're gonna survive? Or you think the storm will kill them? They will live. Even in the bitter cold? The roots are strong. As long as you protect them, nurture them, they will continue to grow, to flourish. Just takes patience... and care. Like life, no? You try. What? Here. You sure? Yeah. Whoa, whoa, gentle. It's an extension of you. You don't have to be so rough. Good. Remember, it's a living thing. Be mindful of your actions. Okay? Mm. So have you always done this? Gardening, I mean. I did a lot of different things in my life. Yeah, cool. Like what? Cook, driver, whatever was needed. Were you a driver here? Here, oh, no. They are driving on the wrong side of the road. It's weird. Did you, like, fight in the war? Hm. That was long ago. Yeah, but like, when you fought, did... So, gardening, have you always enjoyed it? Yes. Being outside is nice. Fresh air, it's quiet. The plants are alive. Wait here. I have more shears. I will join you in trimming. Okay? I thought we were just doing this one. Oh, no, look around. Huh? Oh. - Huh? - Yeah. You have a good night, Francesca. Bye, Dad, thanks for letting me take the car. Uh, see you tomorrow. Hannah, wait. I... I really wish you wouldn't... Uh... huh. Movie with Cheryl, huh? Mm, and Tina. Mm... don't go. Hm? Mom, I'm sorry that you had to cancel your trip. But I can't stay here and watch you two keep... Please be careful. And use protection. Mom! - There they go. - Hm. How long for the maid? About 30. By nightfall the house is ours. Do you know what the word samurai means? The word samurai means, to serve. A samurai would serve his daimyo, his lord. And would gladly give up his life in service. But if that samurai fucked up, he would dishonor himself, his family lineage, and most of all his liege lord. And the only way he could regain that honor would be to commit seppuku. Ritual suicide. Using his wakizashi, his short sword, to split his belly open. Now we live in different times but traditions remain. And I, like the daimyo, expect undying loyalty. I consider myself a reasonable man. So I will give you all the opportunity of redemption. You were nothing before me. I took you off the streets, trained you, mentored you, and gave you another chance at life. But now, you have royally fucked up. And because of your sloppy recon, and bad intel, an innocent family is dead. And it's my duty... my responsibility, to balance the karmic check book. So, we do trial by combat. I will give you a second chance to prove that you are worthy. So, one at a time? Or all together? It's your choice. Yeah. They're gone. Only just now? Yeah. Hmm. What about the maid? Soon. Okay. Play it smart. Keep your eyes open. Let me know when you're coming back. Will do. Now, where were we? We good? Yeah, good. Sure you're alright for this, Ken? I'm cool. What? Fuck off, it wasn't my fault. You're the one tying people up in fucking granny knots. Anyone can get outta that shit. I'll granny knot this around your fucking throat. You put that shit away. Shut the fuck up and do your jobs. A bunch of fucking bitches. Sorry. It's true. You're a bitch. - Mm. - Hi, Mom. Looking good. - Justin is a hard worker. - Mm. It's kinda fun. I'm glad to see you're enjoying yourself. Uh, just so you know, dinner will be ready in about 20. Peter, would you like to have dinner with us? Dinner? Hannah is spending the night with a friend, we have more than enough food. I ended up with a lot of spare time on my hands today. I made a huge pot roast with all the fixings. Oh, no. I don't eat meat. You're a vegetarian? Yeah. Huh. I never would have expected that. I like the animals. I can't eat them. Well, I made a bunch of vegetables. You are more than welcome to join us. I think I'll go finish my work. Must be done before storm hits. Alright, but it's an open invitation, just so you know. Thank you, Mrs. Hender... Lauren. Fuck! Excuse me? - Mr. Henderson. - What?! No, no, no, you don't speak to me like that. I finished early so I leave now but that's not okay. Okay, Francesca, just have a nice night. Mm. She's early. Shall we? Stick to the plan. As soon as this is dark then it's ours. It's good, Mom. I was thinking, maybe we could do something tomorrow. Maybe go to Leicester, visit Castle Park. Um, maybe. It could be fun, I guess. Yeah. If Hannah's back in time maybe we could all go together. Sure, Mom. What do you think, Stephen? Hmm? I wasn't listening. You ready? Let's do it. I said, we could visit Castle Park. - Mm, where's that? - Leicester. What? No one goes there for fun. No, no. If we're gonna go anywhere, we'll go to a real city. We'll go to London. That's where the action's at. We can't afford London. Where's your mask? - Home. - What? - Forgot it. - Fucking hell. It doesn't matter, nobody's here. - I should have never brought you back. - But you did. Sure, but nobody ever wants to go to Leicester. Why do I bother? Hm? The food's fine. I wasn't talking about the food. Why are you so obsessed with going somewhere? Let's just stay home. We don't need to travel to be able to spend time together as a family. We won't. You'll just spend time behind your computer. And the kids will go off and do other things. If that's what they want to do, let them. - What gives? - There s people home. How? They're supposed to be gone. Well, they ain't. Do we leave? Nah, stick to the plan and be quiet. Okay. What about Riley? I can't keep doing this. I got the drives. Let's leave. Stephen. Hm? I want a divorce. Good. Oh, hey... Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Well, lookie here. Shh. Nobody move. Nobody fucking moves, sit down. Sit the fuck down! Run, baby! Justin... Run! Well, hey there, buddy. Get off! Oh, fuck! What now? Put them in the chairs, tie them up while I think. Don't think. Just shoot 'em. They saw my face. - They gotta die. - Stop. That ain't your choice to make. The fuck it's not, man. - Put away that thing, now! - No. Why the fuck are they here? You said they wouldn't be home. Well, they ain't supposed to be. That ain't what was planned. That plan didn't work, did it? Quiet! All of you just shut up for five bloody minutes, got it? Where are you going? I'm calling Volker. And if he shoots before I get back, you kill him. Fuck! What? What?! You see a land line anywhere? Nyet. Keep an eye out just in case. You know we're gonna kill 'em, right? Fuck off, you prick. You heard Drake, no killing. Well, they can rat me out. And if they get me, they get us all. Yeah? Not if I shoot you first. Do it then, buddy. Oh, shit! - Well? What'd he say? - You ready to kill 'em? We ain't killing no one. They've seen my face! Ugly as your face is, no one's gonna remember it. - Fuck you. - So we go? - Not yet. - But we only came to get the drive. I know what we came for and we got it. But now, we teach them a lesson and we take more. This place is all ours, let's have at it. Pretty star. You can't leave things like this. You know that! I know what I'm doing. Don't worry, I'll finish them for you. You don't have to worry about it this time. Do what I tell ya. I'm in charge here. No, Volker's in charge. You're just his secretary. Mrs. Henderson, I forget my... Who are you? Get the fuck off me! She saw my face! Who's that? Where the fuck did she come from? Fuck. You two, cut the phone lines. - Let's take care of the family. End it now! - Fuck! Hm? What are you gonna do about it? I'm not going to let you fuck this up again. Think! You have fucked this up. She saw my face... Shut your fucking mouth. Shut the fuck up, shut your mouth. Found your balls yet, man? What's it going to be, man? Hey, go and check it out. Now, why are you running? You think you can beat me, old man? Well? Alright, I'm doing this. No, you do what I say. Why are you hesitating? You didn't on the last job. No witnesses, you said. Now this time is... Good, Ken took care of it. - This job is different. - Why? You never said nothing about this being different than any other job we ever done. He's right. You keep the details of the jobs from us. That is not okay. No. That was my decision and that's final. Now what the bloody hell is taking Ken so long? Go and get him. I want to finish this job and get out of here. Now! And you, you do what I say. This is not finished between us. Not by a long shot. Hey! Get out here quick. What the fuck? No way she got up from that, no fucking way. It's worse than that! What the fuck? No, she was dead. No, this wasn't the old lady. There's only one person that could have done this. It's the gardener. Hey! Where are you going? Who's this gardener? Shh. Get your gun ready. Quiet. Fuck! You knew this guy was here? Who is he? He's supposed to take the fall for what we took. What!? What we stole was valuable beyond just money. Fuck. It's gonna attract a lot of unwanted attention. Peoples are gonna be looking for it, this man's our patsy. You should have said something. Volker said no. That's not right. We take the risk, we deserve to know the details. So I'm going to ask you one more fucking time! Who is this guy? Trouble. Move. I'm gonna kill this bastard! Shh, get up. Keep your eyes open. That's Mischa! Come on! Fuck! Listen to me. You're safe. Peter is here. Easy. Listen to me. Walk with me. We will get your parents. Okay. Walk with me. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Listen to Peter. There is danger. Turning into a fucking parking lot. Hannah, listen to me. Your family are not safe. We need police. Do you have phone? Good. Where? In the house. They all die. Okay, okay, okay. You must go in car. Go get help. Where are keys? In the house. Fuck! No. Okay, okay, okay. I have plan. I'm finishing this. - Hold on, wait. - Why! - I'm calling Volker. - Again? It's up to him. If he says kill them all, that's what we do. Yeah. Go. Move. Yeah. It's all buggered up. It's nothing like you said. It's the gardener, he's military. - He's a killer. - And so are all of you. It doesn't matter. Look, I'll be there in five minutes. I'll take care of this myself. Hannah, now. Riley! Riley. Riley... Oh, my God. I've got you, Mom. What happened? Yeah, it's not my blood. Are you okay, young Justin? No. Who the fuck are those people? I don't know. But we are leaving. I'm gonna kill that gardener. No, you're done for, mate. No, I can do this. I gotta. Wait just a minute. Hold on, I can fix all of this. They must have run out front. Fuck! Come on! Peter, stop. Lauren, I know how to fix... Stay quiet. Hurry. Riley! Go, hide. Oh, my God, Mom. Oh, my God. Go. Go back. You're all dead! You're all fucking dead! You're dead! - You're fucking dead! - Okay. Really?! Justin. You're a pretty little girl, aren't you? Don't know about the makeup though. Don't worry, you pulled tonight. - Get off me! - I like the fight! Peter! Peter! Dad! Justin. - Are you okay? - Me? Are you okay? So I'm going to kill you. Have my way after you're dead! Hope you don't mind, huh. This is going to get a little wet... and messy. Listen to Peter. Run-away fast! Hop the fence, go to neighbors, call the police. That's the best thing that you can do right now. And what are you gonna do? Save your family. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Are... You're alright. Okay, come, come. - I can't. - Quick. Alright. Go, go. Shh. No, no... Are you okay? Mrs. Henderson, are you okay? Who... who are these people? I don't know. But we have to go. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Peter is here. Trust me. - Hannah... - Where's Justin? He's safe. I got him away. Hannah. Get your hands off my daughter! Stephen. Stephen, we need to go. But this is our home, we don't need to go anywhere. And we don't need the help touching our daughter. Are you crazy? There are murderers running around. Lauren, it's not what you think. What does that mean? You fucking piece of shit. Are you finished? S-Stephen, what's going on? Nothing, we're just gonna go to another room, and wait for everything to be over. I wouldn't wait, if I was you. This isn't gonna be quick. Not anymore. Stephen, what's going on? Talk to me, what did you do? I told you before, I'm taking care of things. What does that mean? Good. Where is everyone? None made it. Fuck! Did you get what you came for? - Stephen? - It'll be okay, honey. Company insurance pays fast and pays large. What's on those hard drives, we won't be in financial trouble ever again. - It's simple. - What hard drives? It's simple. Company drives get stolen. Insurance covers the loss. And I've got a buyer for the stolen data, so I make money twice. - What the hell? - Isn't that brilliant? What the hell are you talking about?! I thought you'd be impressed. I've been wanting to tell you about this for some time now. Maybe it's just too complicated for you to understand. The only thing complicated here is this man. You're not supposed to fucking be here. We weren't going to be. Plans changed. I decided that this would work out okay. You decided. Well, thanks very much for telling us. If they hadn't have gagged me, I could have told you how to find him! Yeah? Now, look what's happened. What's done is-is done. But I can fix this. We can still get through this, and come out golden. That's all that matters. You have the drives? You have the buyers, yeah? Of course. Perfect. So what's to stop me from going directly to the buyers myself. So what the fuck do I need you for? Stephen! Oh, my God! Ooh, stomach wound, that's gonna take a while to kill you. Very painful. Stephen, no. Why are you crying for him? - Stephen... - Even I know that man was a wanker. So what now? We go. No. Not yet. First, we're gonna get our money's worth. If you want something done properly, you've just got to do it yourself. Peter! Let me help, Peter. Hannah, take this. Hannah, come here. Put pressure on the wound. Coming. Hold it, hold it, put pressure on the wound. You're not okay. You need... - Don't worry. I'm okay, I'm okay. - Thank you so much. You saved our family, Peter. You saved our family. Okay... - He needs to get to the hospital. - I'm okay. Hey! No! You stay away from my family! Let them. Kill me. You... Merry fucking Christmas! Justin! Oh, baby. Oh, baby. - You're okay. - I'm so glad you're okay. - Let me see you. - Let me see you. Justin. I told you to run away. They're my roots. I had to protect them. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay, okay, alright. Peter, we need to go. Come here. Okay. We need to get you to the hospital. We're getting out. Watch his head. Is he gonna be okay? We need to get him to the hospital quickly. He'll survive. By the time I'm finished with you, you may never wish you had. The dinner smelled nice. Next time try goulash, but vegetarian style, is better. I can teach you how.
