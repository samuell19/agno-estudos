[ Film projector sounds ] - Is life everything you expected to be Chuck? [ Water continues to drip ] - I don't know the answer to that. - What's happening to us? [ Water continues to drip ] - Maybe, we were just never meant to be. [ Mellow, Romantic music playing ] [ Laughter ] [ Mellow, Romantic music continues ] [ car keys drop ] - Trying to kill me? You want something to drink? - Sure what do you got? - Water, iced tea, whiskey? - I'll take a glass of whiskey if you're having one. - Sure, neat? - On the rocks. - You got it. [ Mellow, Romantic music continues ] [ Lounge guitar music plays throughout ] I'm glad we ended up coming here. - Why so you can try nasty things? - No I like hanging out with you. - Aw you're sweet? Yeah, I couldn't take being in that bar anymore anyway. . There's so many douchers out, it's becoming an epidemic - You noticed the four to one ratio of guys the girls in there? - I don't know what makes one of them think that they're gonna get laid with that strategy- - And they're all wearing the same goddamn shirt. Stripes and collars, stripes and collars, MMA shirt, stripes and collars. - Meanwhile... It's the dude sitting clear across the bar that's paying no mind to anybody that's more impressive than those a-holes. Which guy were you Chuck? - I'm the guy Okay, if the bar is on top of a mountain, I was on the other side of that fucking Mountain. - Aww that sounds so lonely. - You got it all wrong I'm sitting on the beach side everybody else is getting mauled by fucking bears. - Can I uhhh come on the beach side with you- - It's not gonna be that easy, the buck stops here. - You say such corny shit. - All right, I have a query. The name Luna I love it, what made your parents come up with that? - We're gonna need a lot more of this and then I'll tell you all about it [ Lounge guitar music continues ] Oh shit! [ Lounge guitar music continues ] Not yet. - I'll get you some paper towels [ Lounge guitar music continues ] Sorry about that. - Ah don't be My hands are gonna get sticky but that's alright I'll wash him in a minute. - I'm sorry. I wasn't even thinking. - It's all good. Least it wasn't the old spill the wine on the shirt trick and then I'd have to get nakey- - I got wine, I can go get some wine if you want. - Just chill, alright. - Alright so your name, who decided and why? - My father actually. - Really? - Yeah, it's kind of a sad story. - Well if you don't mind I'd love to hear it [ Slow dramatic music ] - My mother Before I was born, before she was pregnant with me She was diagnosed with cancer. The doctor said she had several months to live If had been a car accident or if she fell it would have completely destroyed my dad But ah... Don't get me wrong. He's a monster when he wants to be but in a good way Because he cares so much about us and sometimes he's just a little overprotective So my dad he's funny too He actually bought hospital scrubs so he could look like an employee And he'd go there and he'd sneak in and sneak her out on the wheelchair at night So she can adore the moon and the stars And then one night there was a lunar eclipse And he knelt down beside her cheek-to-cheek gazing up Once the tears rolled down her face and touched his he couldn't stop Only my mother could make my father cry At that exact moment suddenly her pain just subsided And ever since then he started calling her my little Luna I'm really sorry I never tell this story When I think about it, it makes me cry Saying it makes it worse Oh shit now my eye's gonna smell like whiskey. - My bad I didn't even realize, let me get you a new one- - No, it's okay - So your mom she's been okay since? - I'd like to believe that she is. But Unfortunately I never got the chance to meet her after all the painful years and the complications it's a miracle I survived. - I'm so sorry Luna. - No it's alright. Can I use your bathroom? - Of course, straight ahead, door on your left. [ Soft Uplifting music ] [ Music transitions to a slow Dark tone ] [ Abrupt Instrumentation BANG ] - My makeups running, I must look fabulous. - Even more beautiful than before. - You do have a way with words don't you? Well, that was depressing, sorry if I killed the mood on the first date - Not at all, are you crazy? - Let's think of something fun to talk about You like dancing? - Nah, I don't dance. - Oh, Come on [ Jazz music playing ] Not today. [ Cell phone vibrating ] I gotta pee. [ WHOOSH sound ] - Whoa - Jesus! - Everything alright? - I didn't know you were there. What are you doing? - I gotta use the bathroom too. - Don't do that I get scared. - I'm sorry. - Scare-wee. - Alright, I won't scare you again. - Wash your hands. [ Slow build of Haunting lullaby music ] I never take naps. I feel so much better. - Sometimes our bodies just need to reset. - Touche'. What are you writing? - It's kind of hard to explain. - Is it a comedy? - Maybe to some No, not really - You should write a love story. - I'm so jaded when it comes to love. - You don't love me? - I do love you. - I have an idea for a love story. - Oh yeah? - Mmhmm You want to hear my idea? Imagine living in a world all your own a world of beauty, peace love. Some of us are gifted with vivid imaginations And most of those visions are inspired by dreams But what if dreams are the gateway to a spiritual connection to the one you love, your Soulmate? Imagine you could fall asleep with your soulmate And open up a channel to meet in another dimension and create your own little world together Some of us would be frightened by this idea Scared that their fears may come to life. But then it wouldn't be their dream it'd be their nightmare. But they must overcome those fears That's why they have each other to protect one another in their own perfect little world. Sorry Did I disturb you? - No, it's fine. Anything left in the car? - Think there's like, one more bag. [ Waltz music ] Jammy lady was there. - Who? - You remember that half homeless woman pushing the shopping cart around in the parking lot you bent over she was behind you and she was like, "nice jammy's" - Oh, yeah, I gotta hide my ass every time I go to pick something up. - Dude, she wanted your ass. -Don't even get me started. - Cup the balls - Come on - Twirl the pubes. - You seem so cool about it. - Listen, you want to leave me for Jammy Lady honey....it is all good. - You're fuckin crazy. [ Phone vibrating ] Are you gonna answer that? - Hmmm? [ Phone continues vibrating ] It's my dad, I don't feel like talking, I got too much shit to do. What do you want for dinner? - Nah, nah, no don't worry about it. - What do you want for dinner? - You don't have to cook. We'll just grab something quick. Ya know...take out or delivery. - Babe I just bought all these groceries. Come on just tell me what you want. What are you in the mood for? Mmmmm if you could have anything in the whole wide world what would it be....? - Lobster tails. Where are you going? -Just keep writing.

[ Bacon continues to sizzle ] - Would did you want to do today? - I don't know, I was thinking maybe the beach. - Have you been outside? How's the weather? - Nah I haven't had the chance to do anything. I've been cooped up in here the last few days... I couldn't tell you if the moon was the sun or the sun is the moon. - Let me shed some light for you. - And it's raining. - FUCK. - What the hell happened? Are you alright? - The oil, it spit at me really bad. [ Eerie music ] [ Luna winces in pain ] - Anal's best-kept secret. - Shut up. - Do you want the band-aid? - No, I it's better to just let it breathe. - Then breathe you shall. For now. [ Door opening ] - Hey - Hey. You need help? - No, that's everything. How's it coming? - Want to see what I wrote? - Just give me one sec or you know what, just read it to me. - It's a lot to explain, it's definitely easier to read. - Okay. Okay [ Soft lullaby music ] And you believe that - Well, I'm not saying there's no God. - But you don't believe there's a higher power that created us? - No - What do you mean? - You have fears right? - Yeah. Oh wait. I know what you're about to say. - Well, I used to always feel like there was something in my room or I might hear a sound, somebody was watching me. - Oh, I know I know because you're thinking about it, your brains projecting it and therefore it's all in your head right? - Pretty much yeah, like if I don't think of something in particular, thats gonna freak me out, then it doesn't exist. - Mmm, no I don't believe that - But you can't watch a horror movie without getting scared at the end of the night thinking somebody's in your room. - Well yeah... - So, what if I were to tell you somebody was in the house. - Don't scare me! - Just let me explain. - Nooo, now I'm scared. - See what I'm talking about? - Started talking about something that's not even real and you've already convinced yourself that it is and now you're scared. - I don't care. I believe there is demonic entities I know I've seen it before. you can't explain why weird shits happened to me in the past. - You're right. I can't. but that doesn't make you right too. - Whatever No, I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight because there's some thing lurking in the apartment and you managed to avoid the whole point as to why I even asked you why you don't believe or are not sure God exists? - Back when the Bible was being written, if I took this lighter and went like this [ lighter ignites ] probably get burnt at the stake for witchcraft or sorcery whatever the hell you want to call it. People weren't very bright back then. Well, who knows? They might even treat me like a prophet Jesus turned water into wine This asshole made fire from his finger You agree? - Hmm I guess so My mouth is dry. Do you want some water? - Sure. [ heart beat sound ] [ fly buzzing ] - What the hell is that smell? [ Dark tune builds ] Do you smell that? - Don't think so. [ sniffs ] - Something smells rotten. - I don't smell anything. - It's like really rotten. [ Dark tune fades out ] Wait, it's gone now. - Okay So do you agree that exorcisms aren't real? - No, I think they are real, 100%. - We're talking about people that actually believe someone would epilepsy having a seizure was possessed by a demon. [ church bells ringing ] Foaming at the mouth, eyes rolling in the back of the head Not very pleasant to witness is it? We didn't have any antibiotics, no brain scans MRI's, fucking Advil. The reason for everything? the devil "Lord have mercy! Send this child down to the depths of hell!" Makes us pretty laughable as a species if you ask me. - I see your point but I don't believe in the Bible. I believe in God, yes. I believe in Jesus definitely but not the way most Christians do I'd like to call the Christian Church the House of judgments. Nobody's a better Christian than you are. You apparently know more about what God says and wants than anyone you speak with, with the exact same beliefs. It's like a cult of one uppers and the house gets all the money. - Exactly. [ Uplifting soft piano music ] - I'm sorry for being sick - I'm not even gonna respond to that. - You just did. [ Soft music goes dark to an abrupt BANG ] - What's on now? - Typical reality bullshit. - I just don't get it anymore. Why do you have to know who these people are? How is this even a show? - Because the sister made a sex tape. Now the whole goddamn family's reality stars because of it. This industry's flooded with self-centered egotistical assholes. Thanks to this bullshit. Now all you need is a selfie and a million stalkers to get hired for anything, talent not included. - You should write that down and make a spec commercial. "Batteries not included Talent not included. Risk of your child taking a million selfies at once, seek medical treatment immediately [ laughter ] household remedies include spankings, timeouts, and part-time jobs." [ Deep rumbling music ] - Ow it hurts to laugh! [ Cell phone vibrating ] [ Deep rumbling music ] [ Deep rumbling music fades] [ Cell phone stops vibrating ] I feel like diamonds are so tacky. I mean for engagements wedding rings great I get it. No, no I don't know Just more of a pearl girl. - I've always said that One way to determine a classy girl is by the set of her pearls and I in no way shape or form mean that as a sexual innuendo - No, you're right. There's something about old-world class that attracts me. [ Sneeze ] [ Slow build of a darker piano tune ] [ Dark, Deep tone underscores the scene ] - Wanna hit this? - What? No, ow my throat hurts. I don't know how I got sick. - Did you see anybody when you were out the other day? - No, I just went to the store. - Were you around kids? - Fuck no... - I stay far away from kids only cause their parents can't control them. when they start kicking and screaming, carrying on being little bastards. - Such a loving person. - Hey. Feel bad for me, I'm the one that's sick. Don't hate me cause I don't want kids. - Wasn't even thinking about that. [ Soft, slow eerie lullaby playing ] - Okay Is that bad? - It's what bad? - That I don't want kids? - No, it's the women who have kids that get offended when you tell them you don't want them. I'm not saying all women, just the particular ones that can't keep their mouths shut That's what's bad. - You have no idea the looks and attitudes I get Chuck when I tell people. - I bet, like, why the fuck do people care if you have them or not? What makes Mother's act this way? - You know what? This is the last thing I'm gonna say about this topic, mainly because my throat is fucking killing me But I'd like to tell these motherfuckers. "You know what? the doctor said I can't have kids so who the fuck are you to judge Just accept it what somebody says they don't want to have a baby. Maybe it's because they feel embarrassed and they shouldn't have to tell you their fucking business you whore. - Is that true? - No But I fucking snapped on some bitch who was pressuring my friend who actually can't have children. I felt so bad I could see the pain in her eyes, you know cause she hasn't really accepted it yet. She's not the only one. [ Abrupt BANG of instruments ] [ Haunting low church chimes and vocal hymn ] [ Hymn fades out ] Ooo before we go there was this place I saw that I think would be perfect for our wedding. - Can you give me a second? I just want to take the trash out. - No, do it after, come here I really want to show you this. [ Soft, Romantic music plays throughout scene ] Check it out - Wow How much does that cost? - Who cares? It's our wedding. - Yeah, but you know. - But what, you know what? - How much does it cost? - Ooo Look at that. How about that for a venue? - It's nice, looks different. - Nice? - Well, yeah, I mean what's wrong with the first place we picked out? - I don't know Every couple on Long Island gets married at the same place with the same shittiest catering overlooking the same feces infested water. I want to be above the clouds where the air is crisp and the little tiny holes in heaven shine bright wouldn't that be romantic? - Our wedding still not for a year from now. - You do know what goes into planning a wedding? - Obviously - Obviously you don't. You got to pick the place. You got a special order the flowers. We got to pick the invitations I got to mail the invitations and I got to get a dress. You got to get a dress- - A suit. - What? - Suit, not a dress. - I'm not gonna wear a suit. - No dummy, for me. - What did I say? - Dress - Okay. Now I lost my train of thought. - Awesome. I'm gonna go take the treasure out. - No, sit back down. We're not done yet. [ Computer typing ] - It looks nice I'd say go for it. - But Chuck I want this to be really special. - It will be. - Are you sure? - From my heart to yours babydoll I give you my word. There's something I want to show you. [ Long note suspense ] [ Soft lullaby ] - You remembered. [ Soft lullaby ] [ Hands tapping rapidly on knees ] [ Luna's muffled singing in the shower ] [ Shower turns off ] [ Door opens ] What? - Nothing. - Making fun of me? - Maybe... - You're laughing at me. - I'm just enjoying this. - Whatever. I know it's lame. - Who sings that? - Reba. Well, originally it was Bobbie Gentry. - Reba I've heard of, but, not the other dude. [ Luna laughs ] Bobbie Gentry is a woman. - Really? That's a guy's name. - It's unisex. I love when girls have names like that, it's so cute like Frankie, Tony, Jordan. [ Luna giggles ] Oh my god! There's the funniest story about me and that song. [ Apple crunching and chewing ] Okay, so I was the only girl and my three brothers, and we went up to Maine one week camping, and the night before I came in contact with the song Fancy my brother Jay, he ate bad shellfish and tapioca pudding and puked in my hair. - Alright so insects, vomit and then comes the song? - Anyway, so the next day, I'm like perusing the campground, and I come across this jukebox with this awning over it. It was really weird and there was this girl standing there. So I walk up to her We start talking we become friends and all of a sudden she plays a song fancy now, you know I'm a sucker for country songs. Love me some country music so I'm listening to it, mind you I'm nine years old, and I'm thinking oh my god this mother she spent her last penny on her daughter's prom dress she did her hair, her makeup, got her all gussied up, and I was like I can't wait to go to prom. I want this to be me. So... For the rest of my life [ Luna loudly chomps on the apple ] I'm singing fancy. Okay and far too long into the future, I find out this song is not about prom at all It's about a mother who turns her daughter out to prostitution. [ They laugh ] [ Disturbing, loud and dramatic music ] Hey, are you okay? [ Creepy unsettling music ] [ Lounge guitar music ] [ Gasp ] [ Lounge guitar underscore continues ] You done? - I got a little dizzy. - Drink more water. - Anymore water and I'll throw up. - Weak. - What? - What? - What'd you just say? - I said drink more water. - No after that. - That's all I said. - I'm pretty sure you said something else. - I'm pretty sure you're hearing things. Maybe you should go lay down. - Okay. [ Lounge guitar music ] [ Phone vibrating ] Babe? [ Phone continues vibrating ] [ Silence ] [ Dissonate suspenseful music ] Babe? [ Suspenseful music continues ] How come you're not answering me?! [ Strange warning-filled musical sounds ] [ Horrifying music ] [ Brushing teeth ] [ Fly buzzing around ] [ Heavy and dark music ] [ Brushing teeth ] [ Frightening music ] [ Chewing ] - Is everything okay? Chuck? - Yeah - What's up with you lately? You've been ignoring me. - I've just been so caught up with work, starting to get to me. - Are you sure? - Yeah, umm, I just gotta get through a few more pages then I'll get out of this funk. - You haven't looked at me in days. Are you still attracted to me? - Yeah, why wouldn't I be? - I don't know It's just how I feel. - Well you got nothing to worry about. - Is there somebody else? [ hand slaps table ] - Are you serious? - Okay, you don't have to get angry. - I'm not angry. It's just a ridiculous question - Sorry I asked.
