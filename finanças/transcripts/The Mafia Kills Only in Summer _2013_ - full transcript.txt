[ARTURO] Do you see that girl? She's called Flora. To me the most beautiful girl in the world. I have loved her since we were kids... ...that's about twenty years. Each day Flora passes this old house. Here there lived a judge I knew. He was the only one who knew what I felt for her... ...because I never had the courage to declare... or rather... I never had the chance. Why? Because we are in Palermo. And here the mafia has always affected the lives of all... ...especially mine. It all began on the evening 10 December 1969... ...when my father and my mother moved into their new love nest. Transported by passion, they immediately decided to conceive. But my parents could not know what was going to happen. At that precise moment in fact some men dressed as policemen... ...but not actually being policemen... ...went to a meeting, without being invited. They were headed to an office that was in the same building as my parents... Viale Lazio 1... 08. They wanted to surprise Mr. Michele Cavataio... a known mafia boss... known as "The Cobra". So at least we give a fuck about them! [ARTURO] This nice party was composed of... ...D'Agostino, Provenzano, Caruso, Bagarella and Degree... ...the only one in civilian clothes because he did not want to die dressed as a cop. The organizer of this unexpected courtesy visit... ...was the future head of the Cosa Nostra, Mr. Toto Riina... affectionately known by his friends as "the beast". So while my fathers sperm ran towards the goal... Toto Riina's... men entered the last tunnel to Palermo. [GROANS] [ARTURO] Together they arrived at their respective destinations: Sperm to the egg... ...and the fake cops to the front of the office of Cavataio... ...just below the love nest of my parents. [PROVENZANO] stop! Police! [ARTURO] And it is precisely at this moment... ...that my life intersects for the first time with the Mafia. [SCREAMING] But only one sperm, arriving very late... not having heard all that noise... ...threw himself headfirst inside the egg and fertilized. The sperm was me. If Toto Riina had not organized the "Viale Lazio massacre"... ...I would never have been conceived. [MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND] [ARTURO] My baptism was the shortest in the history of Palermo. I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. May God bless you. Congratulations, many blessings! Thank you, goodbye. Excuse me, have patience. [ARTURO] That day Giacinto, the spiritual father of our family... could not miss another baptism. Congratulations! [ARTURO] One of the first junta headed by Christian Democrat Vito Ciancimino Mayor... considered by many in the scent of the Mafia. Perhaps it was because of those friendships... that... 10 years later police found him dead with 5 bullets in his body... in his luxurious apartment... in the convent of Santa Maria de Jesus At the crime scene the investigators found: Five million euros in cash... a 38 caliber pistol... a collection of leather objects.. ...commonly called "whips". Mom. Mom... mom! Arturo... Mom! Maria Pia, the statue of Garibaldi gives more satisfaction! [ARTURO] My parents were wrong to worry... I did not speak because.. I didn't have the right stimulus. Mom! Dad! But one day a stimulus arrived! Bless this house in the name the Father, the Son... ...the Holy Spirit, Amen. And bless you too this beautiful "bambino"! Giacinto, this "bambino" gives us concern. We try to make him talk, but nothing! This is not a defect! Where I come from we say: Who speaks little says more. Bravo, bambino! Praised be Jesus Christ. - Always be praised! - Always be praised! - I'll see you out, Father. - Dont worry. See you. Ma... fia. He said "mafia"? Look! Say hello to your little brother. Bella! Gioiuzza it's Dad! - Who is he? - Come on. What is it, Arturo? - That man is scary! - Why be scared! He's just a happy dad because his child was born. One who behaves so must have a big heart. Come on. Its Daddy! [ARTURO] Growing up I began to understand in Palermo that nothing is as it seems. Here he says that the Mafia killed Marshal Attilio Bonincontro. Always - the Mafia, The Mafia! They talk bullshit. According to me it's all a matter of females! [RADIO] Brigadier Filadelfio Aparo was killed today in Palermo. Intelligence sources talk about a mafia motive. The Mafia always the Mafia! A person who knew him said he had upset... a female... that he shouldn't have upset. Journalist Mario Francese was killed in Palermo. Francese was good, though he liked the skirts a bit too much... those of others...! Boy, You need to know one thing: More are killed in Palermo by females than heart attacks. - Arturo? - What is it? Dad always fights with mom, they shout bad things... - Good! Good! - Why good? - Daddy told me. - I have discovered one thing. In Palermo, the men who fall in love with women are killed! So could she kill my father? - Your father loves your mother? - He says no. Then you are safe. - Silence you two! - Excuse me, excuse me. [ARTURO] Palermo was a city full of pitfalls... ...it was wise to pay attention. - Good morning, Mr. Chinn! - Thank you. One day I discovered that I was in danger. Arturo, wake up! Come on! Today we have a new classmate. She is called Flora Guarneri, Say hello Flora. - [ALL] Hello, Flora! - Today you sit in the front row. - Arturo. - What is it? Have you seen the new girl? But you, you do not like her? Who did you see? [ARTURO] Yes, I was in love. I was caught up in the frightening issue of females. And I was not the only one. At that moment the mafia boss Filippo Marquis had the same problem. She has stolen my eyes! I'm lost in love. Philip, you can not marry her. It is against the rules of the Cosa Nostra. She is the daughter of divorced parents. But there is a solution! I have an idea if you want to hear... Come on then.. Kill her father so she will no longer be a divorced daughter... ...but an orphan. It's a beautiful idea. See - everything falls into place? All you need is common sense! Arturo, what are you saying? Murder is a serious matter. One is killed because he says too much... ...because he does not fulfill agreements, because of mistakes. But not for a girl. Do you know what the philosopher said? "The creature returns to the creator." Go to your Flora before she takes someone else. - Thank you. - Life is like that. Who is a fool if he stays at home. Dad? - I wanted to ask you something. - Tell me, Arturo. How did you tell mama that you were in love? How did I tell her? I just told her... and... that's it. This is nature. - What about nature? - Arturo, we will talk about it later. Now silence because Costanzo is starting. You should watch it yourself this is interesting. [COSTANZO] Guest tonight: Mr Giulio Andreotti. I would like to ask a personal question if I may, Mr. President. Do you remember how and when you said to your wife: Let's get married? [ANDREOTTI] Now you go quite personal... It is also quite a funny story. - Your wife is watching tonight? - I think so. I'll have to front up to her when I get home. I think that rarely has there has been a proposal... made in the cemetery. I said: "Now is the time I tell you." - At the cemetery! So it was not random. No. It may seem odd... well... maybe it is... As the conversation started I was very self-conscious... because I had little experience. [ARTURO] It was evident that Andreotti was talking to me. Contrary to my father, he understood my difficulties... ...and decided to help me. Also this year we will organize the carnival... We will have a costume party, are you happy? - [ALL] Yes! - Well done! - You, how will you dress? - As Prince Charming. - And you, Sebastian? - A cowboy! Arturo? [CHILD] Jump, jump, jump! Guys, look. But what are you? A turtle? - I think it's Dracula! - But no, guys, come on! He's Don Chuck - the beaver! Of course! The people often wrong, except in the voting booth. Sebastian! What are you doing? Do it like this... You have to hear the noise. Pum! Pum! Pum! Children, come here! Now then... The time has come to award the best costume. The winner of first prize... ...for the best costume... Arturo Giammarresi, dressed as the Hunchback of Notre Dame. A big round of applause! Where is Arturo? Arturo! Find him, right? I am not the Hunchback of Notre Dame, I'm not the tortoise man... nor Don Chuck - the beaver. I am the Chairman of the Board Giulio Andreotti. LAUGHING What's so funny? Andreotti is a decent person, I knew him personally. And he is our Chairman of the Board. Does the President have anything to say to a princess? - Well... I wanted to ask... - What do you want to ask? Want to come with me to the cemetery? - To the cemetery? - Yes, to the cemetery. Flora, come on! Sorry, I have to go now. Fofo's parents are waiting for me. Bye! You were dressed as Lancelot. [ARTURO] That day the decision to dress as Giulio Andreotti... disturbed... not only my father... but also Mafia bosses.. Leoluca Bagarella and Toto Riina. Look who's here! The son of Andreotti. The son of Andreotti? - He looks like his father. - It's true! Tot?, you would like to meet Andreotti? Sure, but he only meets his friends in Palermo. I have to explain I am the boss of Palermo today. Come on! - Sebastian... - What is it? Is there is something between Fofo and Flora? Fofo boasts that she goes to study every afternoon at his home. - Every? - Every Every. - Are you jealous? - No. It is not nice to spy on peoples houses. - Excuse me. - What is your name? - Arturo. Please don't tell her. - Who? - Flora. Ah, Flora! The daughter of Mr. Guarneri. Dont worry, it remains a secret between us. Stop, idiot! That perfume! - What do you want, Arturo? - Emanuele scribbled on Andreotti. - Can I get cuttings from granddad's house? - No. - But he doesn't need them he's dead! - I said no! Want me to cook? Go away... [TV] See that white laundry! But I say white! This dazzling! And what wonderful gifts with the figurines in the collection. Go. Good morning. The iris are good but messy. You know them? A Palermo, who does not know the iris with the ricotta baked in the oven! Here we have to fix it. Give me an iris, please? There you are, sir. Taste. Feel the chocolate chips that are mixed with ricotta cheese? Like this? Bravo! Remember, only here can you eat the iris. Arturo, you want to eat that at recess? That one. - Do you know who gives you these things? - No. - Fofo. - Yes? Did you give me this? - Yes. - Thank you. [ARTURO] I could not give up. I had to find a way to unmask Fofo... Andreotti came to the rescue again. I had to take an iris to Flora, this time without hiding. - Arturo, come here! - Stop, you can not pass. - Who is it inspector? - It's Boris Julian. They ruined the feast. - Flora, I have to tell you something. - Tell me. Fofo is a liar. I bought you the iris. And why isnt there one on my desk this morning? You cant eat iris anymore. Inside there are bullets that killed a man. - Really? - I saved your life. Thank you! Flora, here is your iris today. Liar, I'm not coming with you to the cemetery. [ARTURO] After the murder of Giuliano in Palermo everything changed. We saw people dying every day. Toto Riina had decided to conquer our city... And to take it... he was ready to exterminate all... Also the rival gangs. For the first time the bosses of Palermo were afraid. [TV] This is yet another murder that has consumed the city... According to investigators... there could be war between rival factions of the Mafia. Many bosses have left Palermo to escape from possible attacks... They seek safer havens.. And there is the fear... ...that this clash is only the start ...the list of victims is likely to increase. [MUSIC FROM TV] Flora! Flora! - Flora, I have to tell you something. - Were listening. - I saw a mob boss. - A friend of my father... said mafia bosses do not exist. - He knows, he is a lawyer. - See? I know where there is one, he is hiding in my grandfathers house. - I do not believe you, you're lying. - I'm not a liar! - Come, I'll show you. - Okay. We'll go tomorrow. But he is not invited. Alright. Good night, love. Good night. - Papa. - Eh? - Is the Mafia dangerous? - No, it's like with dogs. Just do not give them trouble. I have read they kill people. Things they write... - They might kill us? - Arturo, quiet. Now we are in winter... the mafia kills in summer only. Sleep time. Dad. - Yes Arturo. - Thank you for the poster. You are welcome. Now switch off. - Ciao! - Ciao, Flora! Yesterday a friend of mine told me... ...he would take me to a mafia boss. Remember the address of the boss and then tell me. Judge Chinnici, good morning. Show me your hand. No, show me the right hand. Is friend called Arturo? - Yes, and how do you know? - Judges know everything. Come on. - He lives here? - Quiet, no one must hear us! You must see! Come on! - Come on! - Quietly! - Here is where the boss eats. - Really? Whats in the rest of the house? And who are you? - You are Arturo? - Yes, he is Arturo. Did you cut out these photos? Yes, it was him. Why do you care so much about Andreotti? You are not a mafia boss? No, I'm a journalist. - Are you are hiding in this house? - No. It's rented, with a regular contract. Fofo was right, you're lying again. [ARTURO] After the foolish mafia boss story... ...Flora saw me as less than zero. I began to envy my friends who fell in love all the time. That beautiful Gemelline! Children... Today... we have a special guest. Flora's father, Dr. Guarneri. - Pay attention. - Good morning, guys. In addition to being Flora's father... I head the bank of Trinacria Palermo... ...and this year we decided to fund a competition for schools... ...which is called "journalist for a month". Each participant will compose a theme on our city... ...Titled "A Day in Palermo". The winner will have the honor of writing for a month for "The Journal of Palermo". So now it's up to you. Get busy. [ARTURO] on the 15 June last year for the promotion... ...I convinced my father I would give a story on Giulio Andreotti. There were many people. The first to speak was a dear friend... ...or at least he identified himself as Mr Salvo Lima... ...he only said: "Sicily needs Europe..." "...and that Europe needs Sicily." And on behalf of the authorities behind me... ...a special thank you also goes to Doctor Guarneri... It's my manager, you recognize him? ...funder of this initiative of which I am really proud! Now is the most important moment of this day. I have the honor to announce the winner of our competition. The award goes to Arturo Giammarresi! Go! Go! Come Arturo. And now, Arturo will read us his beautiful theme. Next, read! Director sorry, they killed Pio La Torre. They killed Pio La Torre. - "A Day in Palermo." - Sorry... We have some very serious news, we have to suspend the ceremony. We congratulate the winner... and we wish him a happy career. Thanks to all participants. Excuse me. [TV] The car of the regional secretary of the PCI - Pio La Torre... ...he was flanked by a killer who fired on him... ...and his driver Misalvo Rosario, 46, in a barrage of machine gun fire. Death was instant for both. This heinous crime is on the eve of the arrival to Palermo... ...of General Carlo Alberto Della Chiesa... ...who has been appointed to deal with the resurgence of the Mafia in Sicily. "Then Giulio Andreotti spoke." You liked the Andreotti meeting? "The whole crowd cheered." "You see that is a person who helps many people." "In fact, someone said that Giulio Andreotti is more than a friend..." "...he is actually the friend of friends." "I decided when I grow up, I will be the friend of friends..." "...so a lot of people will wish me well." Bravo! So you want to grow up to be a journalist? You know that a journalist does not take applause... ...has no friends among friends... Is considered a nuisance... and... there is always someone who complains about your articles? - But he can write whatever he wants. - No, this is the problem. Sometimes you are forced to write what they want. If you don't, they send you to cover Sports like myself. - Do you like sports? - No, it sucks. So it takes tenacity, endurance, fortitude. Do you have that? - Yes. - Oh! Bravo! A good journalist is judged by the interviews. Who would you like to interview? The janitor? The teacher? No. [ARTURO] To impress Flora decided to focus on the man of the moment. It was said that this person would solve all our problems. - Boy, where are you going? - To interview Della Chiesa. Go home we have work to do. - And who are you? - I'm Arturo Giammarresi... The reporter for a month for "The Journal of Palermo." - I'm here to interview you. - What an honor! Come. Sit down. Thank you. What has he come to ask - this important journalist? I recommend, however, no tough questions. First question... ...you are here to fight the Mafia... but Mr Andreotti says... the real emergency is crime in Campania and Calabria. Maybe he has the wrong region? [ARTURO] The general says he is fighting a war against the Mafia. But to fight a war takes an army... ...and there was no one around him. There were only two policemen without hats. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. So maybe Mr Andreotti is right... in Sicily obviously there is nothing to do. Bravo, Arturo. You will have a great future as a journalist. Fofo? My fathers driver, saw in a parked car... ...the severed head of a man with sunglasses. A severed head with sunglasses... that's cool! The rest of the body was in the trunk. Yes, I saw it. [APPLAUSE] Okay, guys. Happy holidays, see you in September. [ARTURO] Flora was becoming an impossible love. Boss Leoluca Bagarella had it worse than me... Tosami Lady! Tosami Lady! What an amazing singer! - My Sugar! - What the fuck are you doing here? You should not have killed the beast who had no money? Toto, I cant do anything Spain makes my blood too hot! Luchino, take me seriously. Fulfill your commitments and then you go to Spain! Alright. [ARTURO] That was the last day of school before the summer holidays. I would not see Flora for more than three months. I found solace only in one person, as always. The President likes eggplant? [ARTURO] My album was enriched with new adventures of my hero. Then came September 31982. [BELL] - Have you seen? - Of course I saw it. No ones talked about anything else since yesterday. Colleague, I must compliment you. You were one of the last to interview him. I understand that you're upset... ...but we journalists go around, meet people... ...tell stories that do not always end well. - This is not the problem. - And what is the problem? Maybe I should apologize to the General Assembly. I asked him: "Why are you in Palermo?... if crime is the emergency in Campania and Calabria?" I was sure of my question, I quoted Andreotti. A journalist must always be attentive to their sources. Let us say that in this case Andreotti was not a good source. [ITEM NOT AUDIBLE] [BELL CHIMES] [ARTURO] I even went to the funeral to ask the President Andreotti: Because I had to ask a question? How did he know that the crime was only in Campania and Calabria? Were we really safe? Who had told him? I managed to catch a glimpse of the secretary of the Socialist Party - Bettino Craxi... The leader of the social movement ...Giorgio Almirante... Pertini.. the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini. But never him... Giulio Andreotti. I never saw him because there was not there. When someone asked him why he was not at the funeral... ...he replied: "I prefer to go to baptisms." [TV] Judge Rocco Chinnici said he was satisfied... ...with investigations undertaken by judge Giovanni Falcone. Thousands of bank accounts are under review in Palermo... - ...where money could be hidden... - But I say, he had never seen? Get your hands on the current accounts! Transfer to the banks. What are you going to find? Every evening, the police are in the bank! I don't get overtime! Call it justice! - What is it? - What's up! The leaders are shitting on us, Guarneri at the top. And we have to take it and the other employees! - Guarneri - Flora's father? - How many Guarneri do you know? Flora's father, yes. - Dont stay there all night. - Study. - What time do you call this? - Excuse me. Go immediately to your place. Someone left this. [TEACHER] We'll do this exercise. If I... [FLORA] Dear Arturo, do you remember your invitation to the cemetery? It's been a long time... but I think it's time to accept your invitation. I'll meet you today at 4pm at the cemetery of Santa Maria del Gesu I have to tell you something important. I've been waiting a long time for this moment. I know, but now shut up, I have to tell you something important. - I'm moving to Switzerland. - To Switzerland? Ah, for the holidays! The chocolate is delicious there. No, I'm going forever. - Forever! - My father says it is not a dangerous place. - There are no judges. - And you're happy? No. Dont worry, she will certainly go to heaven. No - Switzerland. [ARTURO] After our meeting at the cemetery I had two thoughts. The first: Flora was in love with me. The second: I had to do something to convince her to stay. Come in. - Everything all right? - Yes. [ALARM] [ARTURO] I was pretty sure Flora would tell me... ...that she would stay in Palermo. But this morning, my message wasnt read by Flora. Judge, good morning. E bravo, Arturo! [BOOM] [ALARMS] [SIRENS] [TV] At around 8:10, judge Rocco Chinnici... ...left home at 61 Via Federico Pipitone... ...to go to court... with an escort and armored car. Just as Chinnici walked through the door there was a tremendous explosion. The explosives, 100 pounds of TNT, was placed in a car... this green 126 which was parked under the building. In addition to Dr. Chinnici were others who lost their lives... Marshal of the Carabinieri.. Mario Trapassi, 36... ...married with four children... ...Salvatore Bartolotta, 56, also married... ...leaves two sons... And Stefano Li Sacchi, 56, the caretaker of the building. The funeral is tomorrow morning in the church of San Domenico... ...where the funeral of General Dalla Chiesa took place... [ARTURO] Flora left for Switzerland and I did not see her anymore. I could not confess that I was in love with her. I decided that I would never tell any woman. Francis, my journalist friend, stopped reporting sport... ...and found work as a correspondent for a newspaper in the north. Colleague, I'll watch for your articles! [ARTURO] In the city there was a historic event: The people of Palermo discovered that there was a mafia. They noticed judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino... who initiated the maxi trial of the Cosa Nostra. [SPEAKER AULA] Abate Mario, Lombardo Sebastiano, Scalia Giuseppe... Rizzi.... Joseph, Joseph Mangano, Benedetto Spataro, Renzino Alessandro... Giovanni Brusca, Alfredo Cross, Cross Dominic, Antonino Mineo... Prestifilippo... John, Joseph Prestifilippo. This Association - the so called "Cosa Nostra" ..."The family takes the name of the district where you will find this family... ...above these families exists a committee... ...composed of people who are known as 'district bees'". [ARTURO] Behind the bars there were many big shots... ...but missing - the boss Toto Riina, who preferred to follow the trial from his home... ...and he was not happy with the judgment... ...that for the first time condemned the Mafia in a court of law. Cuckolds! [ARTURO] Palermo was in shock, but with the arrival of summer... The city soon forgot the maxi trial... ...Falcone, Borsellino and even the mafia. - Everyone returned to their old habits. - Here is the bread. Thank you. Sparino, do you have to eat today? You are right, but when I work I burn calories. And if I do not eat the blood sugar drops. - I have to eat. - And eat and eat! Good morning. [ARTURO] As for me, I always thought only of Flora. Romeo! There's a letter for you! - Who is it from? - Flora? - What do you care? Go away! [ARTURO] it was not Flora, but Francesco. He told me that I had to react. To help me he had arranged a meeting with the director... Of a local TV station.. :Trying to launch to young people. Diploma... Okay my dear Arturo... ...your CV is a little light, eh? Dont make that face! Dont worry. You're still so young! Jampier promises you we will fill this blank page "together"... - ...together. - Thank you, Dr. Jampier. Just call me Jampier. - Thank you, Jampier. - You're welcome, sweetheart. I read that as a child you wanted to be a journalist. - Do you still have this passion? - Yes, indeed... - Perfect! Do you play the piano? Yes. [PIANO MUSIC AND APPLAUSE] Gentlemen, "bonsoir"! "Bonsoir" everyone! Welcome to the show from Palermo! We have a letter from one of our affectionate viewers. Ms. Santoro writes of a problem that plagues... ...this... our beautiful city... The problem... the sirens of the judges cars. The lady cant follow our program... ...because of these sirens! The question: Why don't the judges go and live outside Palermo... ...in a terrace next to one another? There would be less risk for them and less risk for us. Less stress for everyone! To answer this question, a special guest... ...the noble father of the Christian Democrats Sicily... ...personal friend of our beloved Chairman of the Board... Mr Giulio Andreotti... greetings. Hello, President! Is here with us tonight... [ARTURO] This was my moment. - I could be wrong. - Mr Salvo Lima! Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Take a seat. [ARTURO] Instead I stumbled. It's not that I didn't remember what to play... I never imagined on the night of my debut... ...Flora - My Flora! Arturo. Arturo! Greetings to our wonderful musician for tonight "thats enough"! Oh, Arturo! [APPLAUSE] Go! Sir, sorry for this little mishap. [LIMA] Thank you for inviting me to this wonderful transmission. [JAMPIER] I would ask you every day to my house for lunch and dinner! That increased my stress! I feel terrible. Here he is. If we were in the French television you at this point... You would have been... "cut"! - I am mortified, Jampier. - Dont make that mistake again. - Otherwise you will be... - "Cut" - No, kicked out! Ciao, Flora! Jampier Sorry, but you know... it's the adrenaline of the transmission. He needs to let off steam and I'm his right arm. - The help these days. - [JAMPIER] I'll kick his ass! - You come back to Palermo often? - No, I only came back recently. My father asked me... if I wanted to help Mr Lima with the election campaign. The policies are sensitive at the moment. - You are serving an important role? - I'm his first assistant. A bit like me and Jampier. - With some differences... - I also do more tv work. - I'm a journalist, tour services. - Interesting! - Do you also deal with politics? - I really do not know. We havent aired anything though I have many ideas. Sorry. Flora, come on. - It was nice to see you again. Keep in touch. - Of course. - Call me. - Of course I'll call you. - I do not have her number... - Bye, Arturo! Bye, Flora! I'll call you! [JAMPIER] Certainly, it will be done. Give my greetings to his honour. Thank you. Arturo! Arturino, I don't know how you did it... I do not care... and don't even want to know. A little while ago I phoned the personal assistant of Mr Lima... ...Flora Guarneri. Flora! And as she was? I'll ask you personally, do not miss the occasion... The lady told me that Mr Lima wants you... ...as a journalist to cover the election campaign of the DC... ...on behalf of our newscast. I hope you realize the "delicacy" of this task! Of course! - This time, you cant make mistakes. - Of course! Otherwise you will be... - "Cut" - How? Kicked up the ass. "Exactamente"! I see that you are starting to learn. My son has to do a contest. His honour must lend a hand. His Honour thinks, there are no problems... ...oh no? No. [ARTURO] I had heard rumours about the Honourable Mr Lima... but until recently I'd never before imagined... ...I would find myself in a situation like this but for the sake of love... ...you make a lot of silly choices. I'll call later. Mizzeca, she's nice! Oh! So what? - You cant say? - No. Fofo Cassina! - You are?... - Arturo Giammarresi. - Arturo, how are you? - Well. What are you doing here? I knew that Flora is back, so I wanted to greet her. You have done well but you don't know what happened last week! Flora had a fight with Lima and left, slamming the door. She shouted: "You wont see me again! I'm going back to Schaffhausen." - Schaffhausen? - It's a German canton. - The most distant. - Giammarresi, you can come in. - Coming. I have to go, Fofo. - Go. - Thanks for updating me. - Go figure! I'll put them in a vase of water so they don't die... it would be a shame. - Thank you. - Bye, I guess. There are some corrections to make. We have already spoken, I understood everything. - Flora. - Sit down. I understood everything. But I'm busy now, see you this afternoon. Okay, thank you. Goodbye. I brought you a little token. I really liked them. - I also bought you an iris. - Apart from the iris... ...did you bring any ideas for the project? No, because I thought I would confront you. Any ideas wouldnt hurt, anyway, I'll be quick. Mr Lima, despite not being nominated... ...is working for the party in the general election. The timing is very delicate. These services are important to us. From today you are at our disposal until the end of the campaign. If you have a girlfriend, tell her that for the next two months you're not available. I want to reassure you that I don't have a girlfriend. I havent for years... - I'm sorry for you. - But its my choice. - I'm giving priority to my career. - You are right. It seems Jampier didn't regard you very well. This is a great opportunity, I recommended you. I decided... - Flora... - Here are all the details. I'll see you tomorrow at 3pm at Ballaro market. Perfect. Already eaten? Alright. - Arturo. - Si? There are no bullets inside, I can eat it? Yes, you can eat it but I bought only two. - There are a few people, not enough... - Hello? Good morning. I'm the assistant to Mr.. Sa-sa-sa... Salvo Lima. Testing Salvo Lima! The tone is there, maybe the shot... - Perfect. - Isnt that Jampiers pianist? - Yes, that's why I'm playing the piano. - I have to start the broadcast. - Can you go away? - It's him! - Parapapa! Sorry, I'm working! You have to break the co... How are you, beautiful Flora? - Everything alright? - Yes. - His honour is coming. - Now start the broadcast. Then follow his honour closely, okay? Now excuse me, I have to say a warm goodbye to my fans. You've missed the cameraman! Now that I've said goodbye, we can begin. Sa-sa-sa... Salvo Lima. Salvo Lima, This... - Sir, I support you! - Thank you, thank you. Your Honour! - I backing you! - Do not worry, ma'am. - Do something for the young people of this city. - Quiet! Do not worry, we're considering it. - You must help my son! - Okay, quiet. Thank you all. After meeting with the traders, the Honourable Lima... Launched... a plan for solving the problems of Sicily. Sicily needs Europe, Europe needs Sicily. Bravo, Arturo. We are proud of you. Lima and the Christian Democrats will never die! [LIMA] Once again our party... ...will shine in the upcoming elections... ...I take this opportunity to thank you for the great interest... ...for the great work you are doing... ...and I bring you greetings from our beloved Andreotti... ...who congratulates all of us... ...for what we're doing... ...and especially for their efforts... ...during this election campaign. The Honourable Lima closed the proceedings with an innovative recipe for Sicily. Sicily needs Europe and Europe needs Sicily. The cuckold! He said could sort the outcome of the maxi trial... ...but all were convicted. And as we march to jail Judge Falcone toasts. We need to kill Lima. Those we thought friends, are enemies. [TV] The judge Giovanni Falcone has expressed great satisfaction... ...of the supreme courts decision to confirm all sentences... ...issued in the judgment of the maxi trial... ...against the Cosa Nostra. - Hello? - Arturo. Hello, Flora. If you need me I'm ready. You do not have to fuss every time I call. Excuse me, its reporters adrenaline. You're invited to dinner with me tonight. With Lima in your home? No, Arturo. For dinner, you and I alone. - Dont you want to? - Of course I do. I wont bring the camera. It depends on what ideas you have. I'll be waiting. Only one, is more elegant. Fuck elegance! - Yes? - Flora, its Arturo. The end of the hall, fourth floor. - Flora. - Come in. - Let's get right into the bedroom? - No, in the living room. - Have dinner first? - No, we'll have dinner after. I'm scared, I've never done it. Flora, actually me either. But I thought you..after all these years in Switzerland... ...Nordic country, open-minded... You would have at least done it once. - I'll tell you with a heavy heart, eh? - No, I swear. Let's Sit. - I need your help. - We'll help each other. - I've never written a speech for a politician. - Politician? It's not easy to write a speech for Lima. Ah, Lima. It's not that Lima makes particularly complex speeches. Sicily needs Europe, Europe needs Sicily. If you want to change it, you can put Europe prior to Sicily. Stop being an idiot! Listen to me, its important. Lima wants to deliver a speech, you know with the controversy there is... I thought to start like this: "The Christian Democratic Party is in the front row against the mafia and will fight if..." The first row seems excessive to me. I would say the third row because the second would be an exaggeration. What is it? What is it? - Why are you so grumpy? - Flora... Lima does not say phrases like that, he never speaks against the Mafia. He says this now he is on the campaign trail, for the election? And those who vote? This evening I have had a realisation. I understand who you are, you're an asshole. You think you're better than me, you give me a sermon... Yet when I told you to come to work you were thrilled. Eulogising Lima! And now you are all moralistic. Fuck you! I don't give a fuck about Lima and the DC. I accepted the job to be with you. All my life... ...I love you. Maybe something more. Is this the real reason? - Yes. - So this is the worst way and time to tell me. Now go away. Get out! - Bye. - I understand what you are. - What am I? - You're an idiot! A huge... "cretin"! Only an idiot can be called to the service of Lima... ...And get kicked out in a week. But since I have a big heart, a "grand coeur"... - ...I'll have you back on my show. - As a journalist? - No. As a pianist. You're lucky. I have a queue of pianists at my door... ...that could take your place. Do you understand? Look who's here! Jampier! It's true! - Bon soir! - Bon soir! See? People love me, people love me. Shove it up your ass idiot. [SHOOTING] They are shooting me! - What are you doing? - Did you hear that? - What? - They were shooting! - Over there - someone on the ground! - Here they kill so many people. One more one less... go dear! Where are you going? - This time you'll be "cut"! - We will get hit - fuck! Arturo... - Lima! - They killed him! - Was there a blonde girl? - I didn't see anything. - But if she was here! - I havent seen anything! We're calling the police. [PHONE RINGS] Flora, its Arturo. Its Arturo! Flora! Hello? Its Arturo. [TV] ...the wave of killings is to be found between the pages... ...of the indictment of political crimes. There are some similarities between this murder... - Dad, I need to ask you something. - Flora, this is not the time. No, it's time. Would Lima have made this speech? No. ...I will remember him as a fan of Europe and... ...also as a friend and with great regret and esteem. - What will happen in Sicily? - I do not know... [MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND] [ARTURO] Flora did not know, I was just... ...wrapped in a strange cloak of confusion and annoyance... ...after the death of Salvo Lima that had embraced the city of Palermo. In this oppressive atmosphere I had to find a new job. Hi, this is my resume. Thank you. - Hello, I'll leave my resume. - Yes, thank you. - Thanks. I'll take that back. [ARTURO] But it was not easy... ...and not just for the usual difficulties of finding a job in Palermo... ...but also because it was hot, too hot. The only one not to suffer it was the boss Toto Riina... ...who in anticipation of the heat wave had already ran for cover. But Riina could not get in tune with technology. - I do not understand how it works. - I explained! If you feel hot, you have to press this. Snow! Do you see? If you feel cold, press the sun, eh? Sun, snow... I'm confused! It is the opposite of what you feel. I've been telling you for two hours! If you feel hot, press snow. If you feel cold, press the snow... No - the sun. You have confused me now too! Press something its safe. How does this technology work? I do not understand... [TV] The judge Borsellino supported the candidacy of John Falcone... [ARTURO] A few days after Riina learnt how to work a remote control. [EXPLOSION] I heard my former rival Fofo... was hit with debris from Judge Falcone's car... ...and his escort. EXPLOSION - SUDDEN BRAKING - Jampier was affected to... - Mamma! ...He arrived in Via D'Amelio five minutes after judge Borsellino. Mamma! Mamma... Mamma! Mamma... [ARTURO] It affected all the people of Palermo. But the funeral service of Judge Paolo Borsellino... - ...was kept out of the cathedral. - They are our dead! It's our funeral! Let us pass! [MAN] have shown that the state is not with us... citizens... because we are here! Only the people of Palermo have the right to mourn these deaths! They are treating us as if we are criminals. We want to go to honor the dead... ...These men died doing their duty. It is us who havent slept for the last 48 hours since this happened! Get the mafia out of state! Get the mafia out of state! [ARTURO] And I understood it too. Get the mafia out of state! - Get the mafia out of state! - Get the mafia out of state! - Get the mafia out of state! - Flora! Get the mafia out of state! - Get the mafia out of state! - Get the mafia out of state! [MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND] [EXCITED VOICES] [MAN] I am a citizen like you, I have a right to pray for these people... ...who sacrificed with their lives. [MIDWIFE] Brava well done! Brava, Flora! Another. I see hair, come on! Its coming! Once more then it comes out. Be strong. Brava! Here he is! Look at that beauty! How nice! He's beautiful. [ARTURO] When I became a father... ...I understood that parents have two basic tasks... ...the first one is defending their sons from the evil of the world... ...the second is to help you recognise it. Filadelfio Aparo was the deputy sergeant of the squad of Palermo. He was 44 years old when he was killed. He was considered a bloodhound. It is thanks to him that we have the crime of mafia association... ...and the seizure of assets from the mafia. He worked at the Giornale di Sicilia and was the first to understand the intentions... ...of Toto Riina. Here Borsellino was killed with his escort. Although he knew that the Mafia wanted to kill him he continued. He had no fear. At one point he decided to go and pressure Rome and Rome responded. He did what he could not do in Palermo. Within this bar and there was a strange gentleman with a mustache... ...who gave me an iris with baked ricotta. He was the inspector Boris Giuliano, a very good cop. He gave me my first interview. Do not deposit waste under the tombstone of General Dalla Chiesa. It was he who created the anti-mafia pool. Your mother and I knew him. Subtitles by Robert (and Google and Bing). For Julia.
