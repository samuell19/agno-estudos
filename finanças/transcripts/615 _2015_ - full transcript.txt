Eddie, stop, please, no! Shit. Eddie, Eddie, it's me! It's me, Carla! No, Eddie, help, help, help! (helicopter passing) - Help! - (gunfire) Help! Oh, God, oh! Eddie, it's me. Come on, Eddie! Please don't make me! Oh, shit. Oh, my God, Eddie, oh, shit! (gunfire) Oh, God, no! Eddie, please! You awake? Todd and Emily are gonna be here any minute. Eddie, please. Eddie, I can't help if you don't talk to me. Let's, let's try not to ruin tonight, okay? We need this. We need a normal night with our friends. ♪♪ (soft piano) - [Eddie] Oh, God. - [Carla] Hope you're up. (Eddie groans) - [Carla] Eddie? - [Eddie] Oh, Jesus. - [Carla] Eddie, come on! (laughter) - [Eddie] Whoa, what the fuck? Jesus Christ. - [Radio] I'm Kevin Kruse at Bucks FM. It's gonna be a warm day, mostly sunny with the occasional cloud bank rolling through. Expect it to heat up tomorrow and through the weekend... - [banging on door] - That's them, can you get it? - Days like these, I'm happy to be in a cool studio with the AC humming next to me. Sorry to all your working stiffs outside today. - What's up boss, you see that drone flying in? - [Eddie] Fucking thing was outside my window. - It dusted the field. - I didn't think we had one. - [Eddie] We don't. Did Willie call it in? - No, I thought you did. - [Eddie] Goddammit. How many were in the field? I saw Mike and Millie heading out a second ago. - I mean there's a few of them. We'll get 'em clean, but boss, you gotta realize things have been real hectic around here with you being sick and all. - [Eddie] Uh huh, need anything else? - Nah, I mean just Billy's got a hog that needs looking at, - but other than that... - (banging on door) - [Carla] Eddie, get the door, please. - [Eddie] Tell Billy it'll have to wait. - You got it. - Eddie, I asked if you could please get the door. - [Eddie] I did, it was the back, Troy needed something. - Now it's the front - Can you please get it? - (banging on door) - [Eddie] All right, I am. ♪ So does it do for you what it does for me ♪ - There he is. - [Eddie] Hey. - Welcome back to the land of the living, brother. - [Eddie] Thanks, man. - Hey, Eddie (laughs). - [Eddie] Hi, how are, ooh! - [Emily] Good, oh! - [Eddie] Sorry. - [Emily] It's okay. - Eddie, you remember Emily's sister, Amanda? - We met, last New Year's? You might not remember. - [Eddie] Right. - Hey, I'm so sorry, brother. - [Eddie] Yeah. - Well, hey, I brought you something. Home run, LSU, Conference Finals, bottom of the ninth. We needed you, you pulled us through, man. - [Eddie] Yeah, sure. - Maybe for later. - [Carla] Hey, guys. - [Emily] Hi, I know you said not to, but I brought a little something (chuckles). - That's so sweet. Come on in. - [Eddie] Listen, you guys just plop down anywhere. - Emily nearly brought this new game over. It's a good one. It's like a concentration game or some shit like that. Speak of the devil, still has the imprint of the spiral on it. Man, that kid had a strong arm, but you, sir, had his number. - [Eddie] So you were, um, looking at schools? - I'm going to State. - Ugh, sound sadder why don't you. - What do you call getting into Tufts and having to go in state? - [Todd] Amanda, this isn't the time. - What, he asked. It's the truth isn't it? - [Todd] And who'd be paying for it? Your sister and I have a kid on the way. - Yeah, maybe I'll just hang around and raise it. Old Aunty Amanda, buck-toothed, uneducated Amanda, whose sis was too mean to send her to college. - [Eddie] Listen, um, does anyone want anything? - How 'bout a beer? - [Todd] Amanda! - Just water. - A beer does sound good though. Feeling punchy today? Maybe tone it down. - [Emily] If it's too soon, we can go. - No I want you here, I'm glad you're here. It's just he was drunk at nine, slept all day. - And still taking the pills? - I tried to get him to stop, he won't. He says it's too dark without them. It's just, he said he can't find a reason in living. He said that last night. It's like, it hasn't been easy on either of us, but he always knew what to do, had an answer, you know? Or even if he didn't, he tried. I could depend on him. Now it's like, I don't even trust him. - Oh, Carla, I can't even imagine... - Hey, you okay, man? - [Eddie] Um, yeah, I, uh... Give me a second, would you? - Okay. - [Carla] Sorry if these are a little burned. - [Amanda] Yeah, they look burned. - [Radio] All right, we're back. Looks like some activity at the airbase today, traffic backed up for miles with emergency vehicles on the scene. No word yet what's cooking, but we'll let you know when we do. Till then, I'd avoid the bypass and duck down the local roads. To the guys I took a dig at earlier, working in this God-awful heat outside today, you'll be happy to know my AC broke and the studio is creeping up past 80 as we speak. - [Eddie] Carla, Carla! - Karma's a bitch. Thank you very much. (toilet sloshes) - [Eddie] Enough. Come on, man, enough. - [Todd] Eddie, where you at, man? - [Eddie] Coming. So does anyone, uh, want anything? Todd, beer, Amanda, water. Carla, Emily, anything? - Love a glass of wine, but... Just water, please, Eddie. - White. - [Radio] Sorry, to cut into the tunes there, folks. Just had a caller from that traffic backup outside the airbase. Looks like things are movin' again, but reports are coming in that a gas main may have ruptured in neighboring Owen County. An explosion captured on video and submitted by a regular Bucks FM listener shows a suburban cul-de-sac engulfed in flames. We're gonna post the post the video to our homepage if you wanna check it out. Fire and EMTs are on the scene, but the blaze is said to be burning outta control, with at least three houses raging. - Hang on. - (upbeat lively music) - [Eddie] What the hell? I'll, um, be right back. - Where's my water? - [Carla] Eddie. - [Eddie] Help you? - Yeah, you work here? - [Eddie] Yeah, I'm manager, Eddie Lipson. - Mr. Lipson, pleased to meet you. I'm Agent Hewitt. This is Agent Wood. We're with the Food and Drug Administration. - [Eddie] Oh, God, I've got guests, can this wait? - Sorry, Mr. Lipson, we just need to check your fields. - Eddie, Eddie! - [Eddie] I gotta take these guys out real quick. Shit. - Won't take more than a few. - [Eddie] You know, uh, let's take my whip. Hop in. (engine putters) - [Hewitt] Not worried about these clouds? - [Eddie] Nah, should be in and out all day. No rain coming. - [Wood] You're the manager. Why not live there? - [Eddie] Old owners moved out. It's been empty a spell. Needs some work, but haven't gotten around to it. There's that sun going out. You know, it seems early for you lot. - [Hewitt] What's that? - [Eddie] Early, in the season. Y'all usually stop by later when we've actually got something to check. - [Wood] You got a drone duster out here today? - [Eddie] Oh, yeah. That what this is about? Bit of a mix up. - Anybody out working the fields when it flew over? - [Eddie] Probably. Happened a few years back. Nothing major. A few people got sprayed, irritated skin. We got a decontamination shower now. Hey, Steph. - [Steph] Hi, Eddie. - [Eddie] Hi, Adam. - Were you out in the fields when the duster flew over? - No, my son and I were heading out to pick some tomatoes. - I'm gonna get a whole bush. - (chuckles) Bushel, hon. - [Eddie] They're in season. - Best in town. Y'all should grab some before you go. - [Adam] Can't catch me! - Well, duty calls. Real blessing being a parent. - Yeah, I'm beginning to see the attraction of the simple life. - You ever... - [Eddie] No. - Shame, but then I guess you're a happily married man, right? This will do. - [Eddie] You know, if this is about that drone, I can find out where it was tasked from. Pilot's in hella trouble for spraying our crops. Got a reputation to uphold, organic and all. - [Wood] That's all right, Mr. Lipson. We know where the drone's from. - [Eddie] 'Scuse me? (screeching) - [Hewitt] You see anything? - [Wood] No, nothing. - [Hewitt] Mr. Lipson, any thoughts? (screeching) - What was that? - [Eddie] Probably just a farm dog. - [Hewitt] Jumpy? - [Wood] You're not? - [Hewitt] First time I was boots down in Laos, never since. - Fucking A for you. Not all of us have been in the shit, pops. - Pissing yourself in a cornfield. That's rich. (screeching) - [Eddie] Hey, dude. - [Wood] Where'd you get that blood on you, boy? - Get what? - [Hewitt] Come here! - [Eddie] Whoa, hey! - Back off, back off! - [Hewitt] Get down! - [Adam] Ow! - What're you doing to him? - Stay back! Partner, what do you got? - I need a read. - [Eddie] What? - [Hewitt] Come on! Stay down. - [Eddie] What is that? You know, the blood's probably from some deer got hit up on the highway, comes down into the forest, gets clipped, gets picked apart down here. - [Wood] Oxygen levels are subnormal. Massive cellular degeneration. - Please, you're hurting me. - [Wood] Little to no clotting. Jesus, HB-24D is loose. - [Stephanie] Adam! - [Eddie] Stephanie! - [Stephanie] Adam, Adam! Oh, there you are. - [Adam] Mommy! - [Eddie] What are you doing? - [Hewitt] Shoot them! Shoot them both! - [Eddie] Stephanie run! (gun fires) (Eddie grunts) - Stop. Stop! Calm, Wood. Breathe. Call it in. We need fast response teams on us stat. Containment protocols are authorized. Full burn. - [Eddie] You're not FDA, are you? - Base, this is Wood on site. We have confirmation HB-24D is loose. Initiate exposure radius from our center. - [Base] Copy, Agent Wood. Quarantine teams busy at another location. On you in one hour. - We don't have an hour, base! - [Eddie] Who are you guys? - [Base] Proceed with isolating patient zero. Contain with all necessary force. (radio static crackles) - Dammit, base. (screaming) - [Eddie] Huh, what is that? (screaming) What the hell was that? - [Wood] We should wait for backup. - [Hewitt] There's no time! We have to contain this. - [Wood] Fuck. - [Eddie] What the hell? Fuck this. (flies buzzing) (screaming) (screeching) (woman groaning) Jesus! Millie? Millie! Oh, Jesus, are you okay? Millie, Millie. Oh, my God. - He's here. - [Eddie] What? - He's here. - [Wood] Get away from her! (Millie screams) - Base, Base, this is Agent Hewitt. - [Eddie] What's happening to her? - [Wood] She's hemorrhaging! Stage one mutation, fluids at 80%. (Millie grunts and screams) - Grab her! - [Eddie] Oh, my God. - Help me! Get over here! - [Eddie] I got you, I got you! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! (tense dramatic music) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. What the hell? I mean, what are you doing, huh? No, wait! (gun clicks) - Sorry, Mr.... (Eddie screams) (creature snarling) - No! (gun fires) - [Eddie] Come on, help him! What are you doing? Don't stand there! (gun fires) - [Wood] Come on, champ! Jesus, partner, hang in there. - [Eddie] Oh, my God. - [Wood] Base, Base, this is Agent Wood. My partner is down. Repeat, Agent Hewitt is down. - [Eddie] Oh, my God! - [Wood] I need those quarantine teams! - Hewitt, Hewitt! - [Eddie] Jesus Christ, you know what this is? - [Wood] You motherfucker! - [Eddie] Do you know what this is? Fuck, fuck! (creature screams and growls) (gun fires) (tense dramatic music) (Eddie pants) - [Wood] Come on! Come get some. (creature screams) (Wood screams) (creature screeches) (gun fires) - [Wood] Mr. Lipson, help me! - [Eddie] Oh, God! (tense dramatic music) Guys, guys! (Eddie grunts and breathes heavily) - [Todd] There he is. - Where were you? - I couldn't help it. I threw it on. - Eddie, where'd you go? - It's outta here! Mr. Eddie Lipson enters the history books. - [Eddie] Turn it off! Turn it off! - Buddy, breathe, breathe. - Honey, what's the matter? - [Emily] Oh, Amanda, get him some water. - [Eddie] No, no, no, no. Don't go out there, don't go out there. - [Carla] What the... Eddie? - [Amanda] Emily, he's freaking me out. - [Todd] Eddie, what's with you man? (knocking on door) - [Carla] Who is that? - It's okay, I got it. - [Eddie] No, wait, wait! Don't open it. Don't open it! (muffled yelling) No! - Is this a joke? - [Eddie] No. (all scream and yell) - [Todd] Oh, fuck! - [Eddie] Barricade the door! Barricade the door! - [Carla] Eddie, what is happening? What is going on? Eddie! - Did he just get eaten? - [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? - [Eddie] There are... People are dead! - [Operator] Calm down, sir. Who's dead? Tell me where you are. - [Eddie] In my house. Winding Brooks Farm. - Get down! (screeching) - [Carla] Oh, my God! - [Operator] Is anyone there with you? - [Eddie] There are five of us. We've barricaded the door. - [Operator] Five in the main house. - [Man] I knew it wasn't contained. We can't afford loose ends. Saddle up. We got another one. - [Eddie] Who is this? - [Operator] You're on with the 911 Operator, sir. Just stay on the line with me. - [Eddie] Who were you talking to? - [Man] Get to the chopper. Move, move, move! - [Eddie] You know what this is, don't you? You're not the cops. - [Operator] It'll be easier if you kill yourselves. (phone beeps) (glass shatters) - [Todd] What the hell? - [Emily] Eddie, what is going on? - [Eddie] In the field, Millie, she was dead. - Millie's dead? - [Eddie] No, no, no, no, But she got back up again. - [Carla] So is she okay? Where is she? - [Amanda] What happened? - [Eddie] I think Mike killed her, but he was dead too. - Hold up. What do you mean, he was dead too? - [Eddie] You didn't see anything? Hear the gunshots? - Gunshots? What gunshots? - We were watching your game. - Eddie, what is going on? - [Eddie] I think Mike and Millie died, and then came back to life. - Okay, honey, what pills did you take? - [Eddie] No, it's not... It's... Wait. Oh, God, oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! (growling and grunting) (men scream) (Amanda screams) - What the fuck? Who are they? - They're the farm workers. - Not anymore. - What are we gonna do? - [Eddie] I think we're safe. (creature growls) - [Eddie] Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - No, no, no, it doesn't work. - [Todd] What? - It's decorative. - Decorative? What the fuck good is having decorative gun lying around? - [Eddie] Hold on, hold on. I got this, I got this. - Eddie, Eddie, are you okay? - [Eddie] Yeah, I'm fine. - They didn't bite you or anything, right? - [Eddie] No, I'm okay. - Okay. - [Eddie] We're gonna be okay. - Okay. - Eddie, wait. - [Eddie] No, no, no. No time, come on. - Stop. Listen, man, what'd you see? - [Eddie] It didn't make sense. Millie, we found her. She died, man, she died, and then a second later, she's up, trying to bite me. - Bite you? - [Eddie] Mike, he killed one of the agents. He ripped his neck right open. - You know what that sounds like, don't you? - [Eddie] Now who's talking crazy? You know, it all started with that drone. - Drone? What the fuck, man? - [Eddie] I thought it was some kind of new crop duster. I mean, God knows what it sprayed. - Jesus, I had a bad feeling. Just as we were coming down the drive, for a second, I thought... - [Eddie] What? - I thought I saw something fly above us. Some dark shawdowy object crossed the windshield. It buzzed so low, I figured it was a bird or a crow or something. At the very least, my eyes playing tricks on me. - [Eddie] You didn't get it on you, did you? - What, the spray? - [Eddie] Yeah. - No. The windows were up, the air was off. Nothing hit the windshield. Maybe it stopped spraying already. - [Adam] Mommy, where are we going? - What is that? - [Adam] Where are we going? - [Eddie] Oh, God, no. No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't do that, don't. - [Adam] Where are we going? [Eddie] Oh, Jesus, their car's not starting. Buddy, your car's not starting. Their car's not... We gotta get them! - [Todd] No, no, no, no! Look, look, look, look. - [Eddie] What, what? - [Todd] Nothing. Yeah, nothing. - [Eddie] You think they're gone? - They're, they're coming. Could be anywhere. (slow reserved music) - [Eddie] Let's get Steph and Adam. - No, no, no, no, listen, listen, listen. This is our chance, brother. Wherever those dead or undead bloodsuckers are, they're not here. Let's get my car around back, and get everyone the hell outta here. - [Eddie] What about Steph and Adam? - Pick 'em up on the way. There's plenty of room. - [Eddie] Okay, okay, let's do it. - Listen, I love your spread and all, but I ain't dying, holed up like some coward. - [Eddie] Okay, okay. - [Emily] What are you doing? - Fuck this. I'm having one. - [Todd] We're gonna go now. - What? - We're gonna take my car and make a run for it. - Is that a good idea? - [Eddie] Steph and Adam are outside. They're in their car. Their car won't turn over. We go now, or they're sitting ducks. - Okay. Hey, we'll make it. We'll make it. Look at me. We're gonna be fine. We're gonna make it. Okay, let's go. - Okay. - Let's go. Come on, it's gonna be fine. (Emily whimpers) Shh. Hey, hey, come on, come on. - What if they're waiting for us? - We just have to hope they're not that smart. - They can come back any moment, but it looks clear now. - I don't wanna do this. - You'll be fine. - Hey, hey, just stay with us, okay? - Why can't we wait for someone to come, the police? - [Eddie] The police aren't coming, and I don't know who is. - Come on, we gotta go. - You ready? - Yes. - [Eddie] Yep. (door creaks) Shh. Let's go. (Emily whimpers) - [Carla] Get down. - [Eddie] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me go. (creature snarling) Hold it. Be careful. - What do you think? - It's now or never. - [Eddie] Let me look. Oh, God. Okay. - Okay, buddy, you ready to do this? - [Eddie] Let's do this. - Go. - [Eddie] Go. - [Todd] Go in now, go in now. Go, go, come on. - [Eddie] Sorry, okay, you're okay, you're okay. What do you see? - I didn't look. Get ready. Ready? Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. - Okay, you go first. Unlock the doors. Amanda take Emily. - [Todd] Let's go, sweetheart. - Are you ready? - [Eddie] Carla, I let you down. - This is not the time, Eddie. - [Eddie] In case something happens. - Nothing's gonna happen. Let's go. - [Eddie] Carla. - [Todd] Get down, get down. Okay. - [Eddie] Wait, wait, wait, don't beep it. It'll make noise. Just unlock it. Carla, are we okay? - Yeah, we're good. Let's go, let's go. - [Eddie] Okay, come on. Okay, go, go. - [Todd] Come on, baby. - [Carla] Okay, get in, get in. - [Todd] Come on get her in here. Get her in. (door closes) - [Carla] Start the car. - Shh, shh, shh. (car revs and beeps) - [Emily] Baby, let's go. - [Amanda] Go, go, go, go. - [Eddie] We gotta go back for Steph and Adam. - They're cut off. - [Eddie] Goddammit. - [Carla] Oh, my God, look out, look out, look out! - Oh, shit! - [Emily] Keep going! (creature screeches) - Baby, stay with me. - We're gonna be fine. - We're gonna make it. - Here we are. We're gonna make it. - [Carla] Shit! - We're gonna make it. Shit! (car crashes) (slow tense music) Is everyone all right? Carla? - I'm all right. - [Eddie] Buddy, start the car, start the car. - [Todd] It won't turn, it won't start. - [Eddie] Oh, Jesus. - It won't turn over. - Get out, get out. - [Todd] Get out. - [Emily] Oh, God. - [Todd] Let's go, let's go. - [Emily] Okay. - [Carla] Oh, God. - [Amanda] Ow. - Stephanie and Adam, we have to help Stephanie and Adam. - Let's get back to the house while they're distracted. - [Emily] Shut up, Amanda. - No, she's right. You take Emily. It's safer for you and the baby... I'll get her back You should come with us. - [Eddie] Carla, go with them. I want you safe. - If you're scared, you go, Eddie. - [Emily] Come on, Amanda. - [Todd] Amanda, let's go! - No, come on, Amanda! - [Eddie] I'll get Adam. I got him. - [Carla] All right, okay, no. Adam? - [Eddie] I got ya, buddy. I got ya, I'm coming. - [Carla] Adam, open the door. - [Eddie] I got her. - [Carla] Adam, I need you to come out. - [Eddie] Adam, you okay, buddy? - [Carla] Okay, honey, come on. She's gonna be all right. She's gonna be okay, Adam. Come to me. We're just gonna run to the house, okay? - [Eddie] There you go, big guy. - [Carla] Come on, all right. - [Eddie] You got him, got him? Oh, Jesus, Stephanie, you okay? Stephanie, Stephanie? We're here, we're here, come on. (creature snarls) Get off! (screaming) - [Eddie] Run, run, run! Go, go, run! (creature grunts) (all screaming) - [Carla] Run! Oh, my God! Shut the door! Shut the door! (women screaming) Eddie! (head thuds) Kick him out! - What are they? - They ate Stephanie! [Amanda] I just saw what they just did. - Okay, Emily, take him into the kitchen. Find him some juice. - Stay away from the windows. Why do you have to have such big windows? - What are we gonna do, what are we gonna do? - Pull yourself together! Jesus, that's a little boy in there. He doesn't need to hear you screaming about his mother being murdered, like a scared bitch. - Hey, Amanda, you go upstairs and keep watch. You tell us if they're coming, you understand? This isn't getting us anywhere. Whatever happens, we're riding it out. Now let's secure all the doors and the windows. Tools still in the basement? Eddie! - [Eddie] Uh, yeah. Are you okay? - No, Eddie, I'm not. (slow melancholic music)) - [Eddie] What can I do? - What can you do? Eddie, I have no idea what's happening out there. And part of me really needs you. But I've needed you for weeks, and you haven't been there, and you never even asked. And you know what's starting to scare me the most is that... I'm getting used to it. To not needing you. - [Eddie] Carla. It became our everything. All I wanted was... And when it happened, I didn't know what to do. I felt empty, like a walking shell, dead to the world. I had nothing to live for. - You had me. - You did a brave thing. She'll come around. - [Adam] Where's Mom? - Now what? I came from the city to get safe, you know? - [Eddie] Yeah. - Move to the burbs, peace and quiet. Only thing they kill here is deer. Fill potholes, coach Little League. That's it. That's all I wanted. Simple. Buddy, what's in your head, man? - [Eddie] I'm a failure, bro. I know I am. Better or worse. That's what we said. We were 24 years old. How were we supposed to know what worse was? You know that day at the hospital... (footsteps clatter) - They're coming back! - Where? (creatures growl) (women scream) - [Todd] Eddie, what do I do? What do I do? Come on, come on! - [Eddie] Run, run! Shit! (thud) - Run, Eddie, run! (creature growl and snarl) - [Eddie] Upstairs, Todd! Go, go, go, go, get up there. - Where's Emily? Where's Emily! - Oh, God, she was going to the bathroom. - [Amanda] Oh, no! - [Eddie] Todd, no, no, no. Don't go, come here. (Emily screams) - [Todd] Emily, Emily, no! Look at me, Emily! Look at my eyes! Don't let go! Emily, please, baby, Emily! Emily! - I love you! (screaming) - [Eddie] It's too late, it's too late! - [Todd] No! No! Emily! - [Amanda] Where is she? Todd, where is she? - [Eddie] I'm so sorry. - [Todd] Get off me! - [Amanda] Todd, where is she? - (crying) - [Eddie] I'm so sorry. - [Todd] Get off of me! - I'm sorry. - [Eddie] Oh, Jesus. Carla. Carla. - Oh, my God. - [Eddie] Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Adam, you okay, buddy? Hey, you okay? - I wanna go home. - [Eddie] You can't go home right now. You gotta stay here where it's safe. I'm sorry. Hey. - When I have bad dreams, I hide in the barn in the corner. It's safe there with the rabbits. - [Eddie] Yeah, well, how 'bout we pretend that this is your rabbit, okay? Can you do that for me? Can we pretend? - But it's not. - [Eddie] I know, but let's pretend, okay? I'll pretend, too. Can you do that for me? - I don't wanna pretend. We're all gonna die. (slow somber music) - [Eddie] Oh, God. Carla, Carla? (creatures growl) (floors creaking) (slow ominous music) (cries softly) - He was so... healthy then. Just our little gray blob. - [Eddie] I never thought he wouldn't make it. - I think I knew. - [Eddie] What? - I didn't want to. I told myself that it wouldn't happen, that... miracles do occur, but... when they took him from me... when I couldn't hold him... And then looking at him in that glass box... all those tubes. I just really wanted to hold him once. I really wanted to hold him. (sobbing) - [Eddie] Carla? - You abandoned me. You completely abandoned me. - [Eddie] Carla, I am so sorry I wasn't there for you. - Where were you? I needed you. - [Eddie] He was my son. Our son, but I'm your husband. You shouldn't have had to lose both of us. One was enough. Too much. I'm here now for the rest of our lives. - That may not be long. - [Eddie] I'm gonna get us out of here, I promise you. I'm gonna get us out. Hey, hey, hey, look at me. I love you. I'm getting us out, I promise you. I promise you. - Where was this man? - [Eddie] I lost my way. I nearly lost you. I'm not gonna let that happen again. Carla, you mean everything to me. Carla. Okay? Hey, okay? I hear people on the highway. Let's go see them. It's okay, honey. I've got you now, and I always will. Hey, guys, I'm so sorry. Where's Adam? Guys, where's Adam? - [Carla] Where's... - [Eddie] Is he in there? Carla. - [Carla] Adam? - [Eddie] Oh, where'd he go? - [Carla] Adam? - [Eddie] Guys, come on. - [Carla] Oh, shit. - [Eddie] Oh, no. - [Carla] Oh, God, no. - [Eddie] Oh, no. - [Carla] No. - [Eddie] Oh, Jesus. - Why would he go down? - [Eddie] He was terrified. - Who could blame him? - Oh, God. - [Eddie] I'm going down. - What? - [Eddie] Listen, if he made it, so can I. Think about this for a second, if no one else is coming, and we're on our own, we have to get outta here. Carla, the old truck is behind the barn. I'm gonna go for it. We'll go for the highway. - Then I'm coming too. - [Eddie] No, man, you can't... - No, these motherfuckers need to pay. Get off of me! Get off of me! - [Eddie] Emily is dead! Going and taking these things on is not gonna bring her back, okay? - Fuck. - [Eddie] Think about Amanda. Look at her. Look at her. You have to protect her. She's Emily's sister, man. You have to protect Carla for me, okay? Can you do that, man? I need you to. - Okay, okay. - [Eddie] I'm going down, guys. If I'm not back in 10 minutes, leave without me, okay? - Just come back. - Please don't. Just don't go, don't go. - [Eddie] I love you. I'm coming back, Carla. I'm getting you out. I'm getting all of us out. - [Amanda] Good luck. - [Eddie] Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, God. (creatures growling) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (bird squawks) Oh, oh, oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. I am so sorry, I'm so sorry. (panting) (cow moos) (mooing) (mooing) You're good, guys. You're good, you're good. (sheep bleat) (flies buzz) (groans) Billy. - Hey, boss. - [Eddie] Billy. - Yeah, She was acting real sick, you know, real crazy, knocking into things. I thought that maybe if I could get her in here, I could calm her down a little bit, but she kept charging me down, and, uh... - [Eddie] What hap... Oh, Jesus. - (laughs) Yeah, you know... (groans) She was eating that corn. You know, the corn that the boys brought up. - [Eddie] From out in the field? - [Billy] Right after the duster, that's right. - [Eddie] Jesus Christ. - Mm-hmm. They were taking it down to the food hut for decontainment. I don't know, said his skin was burning. (groans) - She was doing so well. - [Eddie] Was she expecting? - [Billy] She was doing so well. - [Eddie] Oh, my God. - [Billy] Big girl. Brand new litter on the way. - [Eddie] A litter? - Doc checked her out. Said nine pups at least. - [Eddie] Nine pups, Jesus. Let me get you up. - (grunts) - [Eddie] Come on, come on. - (straining) - [Eddie] Jesus. - Oh, God, that smarts! So you wouldn't believe it, but all the screaming, I had to get in there. I had to do something. I had to do something. - [Eddie] Jesus, what is that? - All the screaming, you know. I had to cut 'em out. (piglets squealing) - [Eddie] Oh, my God. What the hell? What the hell? - She had the devil inside her. (piglets squealing) (flies buzzing) (animals screeching) - [Eddie] Do you hear that? Do you hear it? Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ. Billy, we gotta get outta here. We gotta get outta here. - [Billy] Just get outta here, boss. - [Eddie] Let's go, boss, hit the bricks. - [Billy] I don't think we're gonna make there, chief. - [Eddie] Oh, fuck. - [Billy] Hey. Got it, boss, hit the bricks. - [Eddie] Come on, come on. - [Billy] I'm not gonna make it, man. - [Eddie] Come on. - Screw it. Get the fuck outta here. - [Eddie] Keep going, keep going. - [Billy] Fuck! (creatures growling) - [Eddie] Come on, they're coming. You're doing great. Keep going, keep going. Come on, come on! We gotta go, we gotta go! Oh, God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. - Hey, it's all right. - [Eddie] You still got that shotgun? - [Billy] Just check inside. I've got a fucking... I got a trench sweeper in there. - [Eddie] Oh, oh, my God. - [Billy] Whoo! - [Eddie] That CB radio work? Fuck. Watch out, buddy. - [Billy] I just, uh... gonna just catch my breath here for a second, all right? Feeling a little... (radio buzzes) - [Eddie] Hello, hello? - [Billy] Easy there, boss. - [Eddie] Hello, this is Eddie Lipson, Winding Brooks Farm. Anyone there? Hello? - [Agent Wood On Radio] Multiple hostiles, exposure levels unknown. - Crisis clock one hour from initial release. - [Eddie] Eddie Lipson at Winding Brooks Farm. Can anybody hear me? (radio static crackles) Buddy, are you okay? - [base] Copy, Agent Wood. Continue to contain with all necessary force. - [Agent Wood On Radio] Okay, copy, base. I'm in the main house at the end of the drive. - [Base] Drone has been shot down over Doylestown. Quarantine units on your location in 15. (radio static crackles) (slow foreboding music) (rifle clicks) (creature growls) - [Billy] We making a run for it, boss? - [Eddie] Come on, we gotta run. Time to run, buddy, time to run. (Billy groans) (creature growls) Come on! Come on! (Billy screams) Get off you piece of shit! (creature growling) [Eddie] Oh, my God. (grunts) Goddammit, goddammit, Troy. Troy, don't make me do this, buddy. Don't make me do this. Troy, don't make me do this, buddy. (gunshot) (door thuds) (heartbeat thumping) Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, God. (banging on door) Oh, God. (distant whimpering) Hello? (distant whimpering) Adam, are you okay? Adam, are you... Did they bite you? Adam, are you bit? Adam? Hey, hey. Oh, my God. Adam, oh, my God. Adam, look at me, look at me. Are you okay? Hey, say something. Say something, Adam. (creature growls) No! Get off! (chomp) (screams) Get off me! Oh, my God! (rifle clicks) (rifle fires) (body thuds) (moaning) (footsteps) - [Wood] Put the gun down. - [Eddie] I'm gonna fucking kill you. Ah, no! - [Wood] Put the gun down. - [Eddie] You don't look so good. - [Wood] I can kill you before you chamber another round. - [Eddie] What is this? - [Wood] Classified. - [Eddie] Fuck that, and fuck you. My friends are dying out there. (groaning) - [Wood] It's a fast-acting toxin. - [Eddie] You mean you made this? - [Wood] It's an herbicide, like Agent Orange, meant for agrarian warfare, eradicate an enemy's crops, food source, erode terrorist groups' rural support network by driving people to the city. (Eddie screams) What's it doing to me? - [Wood] It dramatically dehydrates the body, forcefully expelling all fluids. The hunger, or rather the thirst, comes on quickly, driving the host, even after brain function drops, to almost subhuman levels. All that's left is the need to survive. And to survive, the host has to replenish fluids, blood, plasma, all the things only another human can provide. So you've got that. - [Eddie] Adam, get out of the way! (body thuds) - Take me to your friends. - [Eddie] Fuck you. - My people are almost here. I can save them. - [Eddie] You're lying. - [Wood] Look at me. Why do you think I'm not in pain? Look at all these bites. Why haven't I changed? - [Eddie] You have an antidote. - Take me to your friends, and it's yours. One dose for you, one for the boy. - [Eddie] Gimme the boy, then I'll take you. Just gimme the boy. Come on. - [Wood] Don't try anything, Mr. Lipson. - [Eddie] Adam, you okay? - [Adam] You came for me. - [Eddie] I promised someone that I would. - [Adam] I'm glad you did. - [Eddie] Don't look. Don't look back. Come on, down the stairs. - [Wood] Playing dad now? - [Eddie] You won't get away with this. Too many people know. - [Wood] Don't fool yourself. One little farm in the middle of nowhere? This won't even make the news. There are forces at work here much larger than you can comprehend. (Eddie groaning) - [Eddie] The government? - [Wood] They wish they had our resources. - [Adam] Where are we going? - [Eddie] Home. Oh, God, oh, God! (groaning) - [Wood] It's acting fast now. - [Eddie] Gimme the antidote, please, please. - [Wood] No. (Eddie groans) - [Wood] Get out there! Don't give up. (heart beating rapidly) Don't give up on me now, Mr. Lipson, come on. Look alive, fellas. Head on a swivel, Eddie, okay? - [Eddie] My friend, his hog had a litter all melted together. - [Wood] In Vietnam, they called it Operation Ranch Hand. Public had no idea we were spraying till '65. That was three years in. Eyes up front. Agent Orange and Agent Blue, they were just for the crops, but the women started having babies. These babies were coming out with two heads, no bodies, no legs, stillborn, heinously deformed. - [Adam] Are we gonna be all right? - [Eddie] Yes, I've got you. - [Wood] You know what it was? Prenatal dioxin exposure. You think that was bad? This strain's gonna be much worse. They better be here. You want your perfect little family, Mr. L, nice little wife, this rugrat can be your son, do not screw me. - [Eddie] They're here. - Adam, you found him! - [Eddie] Amanda, we're gonna be all right. Oh, oh! (body thuds) - Oh, you son of a bitch. You're all gonna die. It's a full burn, no witnesses. - [Eddie] You motherfucker! - You're as good as dead. - Eddie, Eddie! Oh, my God. (Eddie groans) - [Eddie] God! (groaning) - Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, it's okay, you made it. You came back, baby. It's okay, it's all right. - [Eddie] His pocket. - What? - [Eddie] His pocket! - Okay. What, this? Is this what you wanted? - [Eddie] Another one, another one. - There's only one, baby. There's only one. Is this it? Is this what you wanted? Tell me what's wrong, baby. What's wrong, what is it? - [Eddie] Nothing. Nothing. I love you. - I love you too. - [Eddie] Give it to him, give it to him. (heart thumping) (Eddie screams) - [Carla] Oh, my God! - Eddie! Come on, boy! - Eddie! - Don't go, man, don't go! (baby cries) BOY: Mommy, can I... (bike bell chimes) - Eddie! - Get up, Eddie! - [Eddie] Sorry. - It's okay. Oh, God, Eddie, Eddie! - Eddie! (church bells ring) - Wake up, come on! - Wake up, wake up! (slap) Wake up! Please, come on! (baby cries) (Eddie gasps) - Oh, God! Oh, God, you're okay. - You're back. - [Eddie] I-I couldn't breathe. - Are you okay? You're okay now? You all right? - [Eddie] Need something to drink. - Okay, Eddie. - Want a beer? - Eddie, give me your hand. (Eddie screams) - Oh, Eddie. Help him up, help him up, help him up! Okay, Eddie, the water's out. There's no water. - [Eddie] Backups in the basement. - Oh, God. Hey, hey, Eddie. Tell me, tell me what's wrong. - [Eddie] You remember that day hiking the Appalachian, that huge ravine? - When you forgot the water? - [Eddie] I thought that was it. I was so... - You were so sweaty. - [Eddie] Yeah. Oh, God, I watched you... complaining and moaning all the way. Hating me at every step. And all I could think was how we had to make it out 'cause I couldn't imagine not having another day exactly like that one. Carla, I love you. You would have been a wonderful mother. - I love you, too. - (Eddie screams) - Honey! Honey. - [Eddie] I'm all right, I'm all right. Just get everyone ready to go. (slow tense music) (whimpering) (retches) See you soon, buddy. (gun clicks) (heart beating) (water trickling) (growling) (slow sinister music) (growling) - [Amanda] Help us in here. - [Todd] Yeah, I'm coming. (chatter) - [Todd] Amanda, you wanna help him? - [Amanda] Sure. Come help me get stuff from the fridge, Adam. Get that bag. - [Adam] Amanda. - (Amanda screams) Oh, my God! - [Todd] Run! - Eddie? - Holy shit! - [Carla] Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. - [Todd] What's wrong with you? - Eddie. - Kill him! - No! Please don't! - Kill him! (screaming) - [Todd] Run, run, run! - [Carla] Eddie, Eddie! Oh, no. - [Todd] Stand behind me, stand behind me. (screaming) - [Todd] Run, Carla, run!

Eddie, it's me. Come on Eddie, please. Don't make me. - [Man] Drop the gun! (guns fire) (screaming) - [Carla] Eddie, please! - [Woman On Megaphone] Come out of your home. We are here to protect you. If you or any member of your family has been exposed, please let us treat you. (gun clicks) The contagion can be stopped. (gun clicks) (screams) (screaming) (chomping) - Oh, God! Eddie! - [Man] Stop, stop! (screaming continues) (Carla sobs and screams) - [Todd] Eddie, fuck! Carla! Oh, my God, Carla! (sobs) There's too much blood. There's too much blood. Carla, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me, look. Don't go, don't go. Don't, don't, don't go. Don't go, don't go, don't go. Carla!

Doc, we got another one. You, with me. (screaming continues) (Amanda screams) (gun fires) (Todd moans) - [Man] Body armor, motherfucker! Means game over! - [Todd] No, no, no, no, no!
