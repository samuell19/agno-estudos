Have breakfast before you go out. Go and pay the rent. Hello. Kong? Hurry up, Krishna. I'm getting late. Relax, Kong. Take it easy. I can't. I have to work today. Don't go to work. Come and gamble with me. Where did you get the money? My dad gave me money to pay the rent. Are you crazy? What if you lose it? Not today. I'm taking the God of Fortune with me. But now that God is getting late. Let me finish the job and I'll go with you right after. No, I want to go now. Fine, then I'll tell your dad. Don't tell my dad. All right, I'll take you to work. Go. Don't bet too much. Save it for the rent. It's your dad's money. Hey, good hand this round. Go all-in. So? All-in. Are you nuts? You're cheating. Hey, loser. I'm not cheating. You lost the game. You idiot, loser. What did you say? Let go, don't fight. Stop fighting. Stop it. Stop! What are you doing here? Fighting? Drunken brawl? Show me your ID.

Get lost! What are you thinking? I asked you to pay the rent, not to gamble, drink, or mess around. I'm sorry, Papa. Don't tell me that. Don't say sorry until you find a job. That money was my hard-earned money! You'd better go find a job. Tell him, Mom. Papa, you know it's not easy to get a job in Hong Kong. Why are you scolding him? You said getting a job is not easy. He's trying hard. Aren't you, my boy? Look at your brother. He has a good job. And so does your little sister. She does part-time jobs, tutoring, and teaching dance. Don't compare me with them. I don't want to stay here. If you want to settle down in Hong Kong, why didn't you take us with you? Do you think it's easy to move us all to Hong Kong at once? Do you think it's easy to raise the three of you? It's outrageous. See! When it comes to you, it's not easy. You want me to stay here and find a job. What kind of double standards do you have? Well, don't you know your sister has three jobs? I said don't compare me to them. I don't want to stay here. I want to go back to India. Krishna, stop saying you want to go back to India. I brought you here. I won't let you go back to India. I don't want to stay here. I want to go back to India. Why are you such a pain in the neck? Take it. It's enough for two more days. Cheer up. Be nice to Richard when he gets here. It's always that Richard. Why do you still trust him? What is it? What's wrong with him? Without his help, we couldn't have gotten through this tough time. We would've ended up like your brother. Do you really think your husband died of a heart attack? No, it was Richard. It was his fault. Stop saying that. Hey, here he comes. Hi, Auntie. - Hi. - Jasmine. Auntie. Hi, Richard! It has been a while. - Yes. - How are you? I'm okay. You look beautiful. Thank you. Jasmine is definitely beautiful. You can't keep your eyes off her. You are so funny, Auntie. By the way, Richard, have you settled that debt? Don't worry. It's all set. Yes, thank you, Richard. Don't mention it. Hope you don't mind, we've ordered already. Of course not. - Here comes the food. - Let's eat. - Yes, let's eat. - Jasmine, pass some food to Richard. Auntie. Jasmine thinks I am chubby, so I'm on a diet. Let me give you your favorite chicken breast. Thank you. No problem. Let's eat. Yes, let's eat. You're not fat. Don't worry. Yes, let's eat. Richard, thank you for the kind treat. Auntie and I are going for body checkups. You two enjoy the lunch. Go and have some fun after. No need to rush back home, okay? - Okay. - Let's go. Okay then. - Bye. - Bye. So, have you decided? You know, we all appreciate your help after Dad's death. Well, your dad and I were not only business partners. It's my responsibility to take care of you and your family. I'm very sorry about your dad. I promise you. I will take care of you for life. At least let me finish my college first. Of course. I'll wait. Nice. Let me try. Your bike is so cool. Of course! How much cc is it? It's 600 cc. Okay. Hey, look at her. Hey, who is she with? I don't know. Maybe her boyfriend. What? You like my car? What are you looking at? How do you know if you're not looking at us? You're white as snow. How can I not look at you? Krishna, stop! Easy, Richard. What did you just say? Do you think you're cool? Come on. Don't hide behind the lady. - I'll beat you up. - Hey! Don't. Forget it. - Forget it, Krishna. - Let's go. You'd better watch out. Forget it. Forget it. Krishna! Come with me. Sit down. - Don't worry. - Go and play basketball. I won't fight. Let me make some calls. I'll give them a lesson. Don't do that. I just moved here. I don't want any trouble. It's time for that movie. Let's go. Sure, let's go. Scram! Go! Go have fun. Jerk! Bharthi, where are you going? A new neighbor has moved in next door. I'm going to go help them. Bharthi, this is not India. You can't go to somebody's place like this. Don't you remember? When we moved here, nobody came forward to help us. It was difficult. This is Hong Kong. And you don't even speak Cantonese. I don't speak it, but I do understand it. Old dead man! See? The neighbors come. So smelly! You Indians are so smelly. It's just the spices. It's so smelly! You will get used to it. Smelly. It's so smelly. Why is it so smelly? We are just having our meal, man. Sorry. I'm so sorry. My dad has dementia. Sorry for the trouble. - It's okay. We're just having our meal. - It's smelly. - It's smelly. - I'm sorry. No problem. Let's go, Dad. It's really smelly! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Pose up, okay? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Hey, Kong. Let's play a new game. Great. What's the game? Five, six, seven, eight. - Put it there? - Give me some pebbles. One, two, three, four. - Five, six, seven, eight. - Here you go. One, two, three, four. Let's say, one of the pebbles gets thrown into that cup. The new wonton girl will be my girlfriend. You mean, Jasmine? Yes, Jasmine. Okay, sure. Let's see. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay. Do any pose. Yes, okay. Let's start from the beginning. Bug off! This game sucks. Don't play it then. So, what now? Dance? - Yes, let's dance. - Let's go. Seven, eight. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me! Can you turn down the music? What? - Can you turn down the music? - Okay. Hey, what are you doing? Turn it up! Well, we're dancing over there. Why don't we share this area? Well, you don't own this area. Why are you Indians so unreasonable? What did you say? She called you a curry boy. Well, you're a wonton girl! Turn the music up. It's really loud. Let's pack our things and go. Mom! Come in, Jasmine. Don't be shy! Wait a moment. I'm calling my mom. Mom! Mom, come quick. - This is Jasmine, my new friend. - Hi. - Jasmine, come. - Hi. Dad, this is my new friend, Jasmine. - Namaste. - Namaste. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Jasmine, this is my family. My dad and my mom. - Hello. - Hello. Your clothes. See! I told you. She is the new neighbor who just moved in. A minute, Jasmine. I go come. Okay. My daughter always talks about you. She calls you "my good friend, Jasmine." Yes. My elder son works in Shenzhen. He usually comes back on weekends. My younger son has nothing to do. He came all the way to Hong Kong and now he wants to go back to India. Uncle, you have a big family. Jasmine, India big big families. This is small family. Lily, where did you keep the box? Maybe it's inside the wardrobe. I don't want to bother you for too long. I'd better get going now. Don't go, Jasmine. It's my birthday today. - It is? - Yes. Why didn't you tell me? If I told you, you wouldn't have come with me. Now, stay. Tell her that it's the first time she's come to our house, so she must have dinner with us. Yes? Jasmine? You eat go. - Well. - Have dinner with us. Okay then. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Hey, Jasmine. If you're uncomfortable on the floor, come and sit on the sofa. It's okay. I like sitting with you all on the floor. - Okay. Let's eat. - Okay. Jasmine! Finger. Mouth. Okay. - Finger. - Finger. - Mouth. - Mouth. Dear Jasmine! Do you like curry? Yes. Curry. Of course, Auntie. I like whatever you cook. See. Curry like. Jasmine, will you dance with me at a birthday party? Your birthday? Not my birthday, Krishna's. I want you to perform with me, okay? Him? Not him. It's God of Singer Krishna. Indians always celebrate his birthday. It's a big festival. See, this is God of Singer Krishna. He has so many girlfriends. Krishna big big naughty. Many girlfriends. Full love love love. Yes. The singer Krishna has tons of girlfriends, but my brother Krishna has none. Happy birthday, Lily! Thank you. I am happy that you came. I had a great time, but it's time for me to go home. Sure. Thank you, Uncle and Auntie. - Don't mention it. Do come again. - Bye. Bye. Let me walk you out. Thank you. What was that, Papa? Why were you telling her about me? I wanted to help you find a job. And you! What's your problem? Why did you tell her that I don't have a girlfriend? Isn't it true? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Hey, Jasmine! Hello. Come here! Hey! What's wrong with you? What is it? I just had a dream. In the dream, I almost kissed Jasmine. But then you woke me up, you idiot! Stop daydreaming. She is right there. Just go talk to her. What should I say to her? I don't know. Whatever. Let me distract your sister. You go talk to her. Lily! What's up? Your mom is asking for you. Hurry! Okay. Jasmine, can you practice with them? I'll be right back. Jasmine, let's dance, okay? Jasmine. If any of the pebbles falls into the cup, then you are mine. Let's do it like this. If any of the pebbles doesn't fall into the cup, then you're mine. Juggie. Do you want to know something? I'm in love with Jasmine. What are you talking about, Krishna? You can't love her. Why not? Because I'm going to chase her. I see. Well, you're just chasing her. But I've decided to be with her. How can you be so sure she's going to like you? Of course she will like me. - Let's see. - Guys, here she comes. Let's see if she'll look your way. You, you, and only you Yes, you are my dream You, you, and only you Yes, you are my life I can't stop looking at your beautiful face Other than you, nobody else is visible My heart wishes to make a connection with your heart I fell in love with you at first sight You, you, and only you Yes, you are my dream You, you, and only you Yes, you are my life I want to see you Every time I speak, it's about you In my eyes, in my memories, it is only you and you My heart beats because of you You are in my thoughts Only you are in my breath and in my heart Winds have gone crazy since you come Breeze has become fragrant since you come I'm becoming madly in love with you Take me away with you from this world You are the sea, you are the shore You are the earth, you are the sky All colors are there because of you You are my destiny, you are my world You, you, and only you Yes, you are my dream You, you, and only you Yes, you are my life I can't stop looking at your beautiful face Other than you, nobody else is visible Hey, Krishna. What's so urgent? Kong, I'm going to confess my love to Jasmine. Cool, man. Good luck! What's wrong? I'm a bit nervous. Easy, it's okay! Hey, check this out. What is this? It's an anklet. - I see. - I'll gift it to her as a token of love. Where did you get this? It's from India. Smart man. Jasmine will love it. You got this. Hey, it's Jasmine. Go to her. You're already here. It's a good chance, man. Come on! Come on! Come on. The bus is coming. She'll be gone. No, I'm really nervous. It's your one and only chance. Don't miss it. Go. Come, quick! Thank you. Don't be afraid. You can do this. Jasmine. I have something important to tell you. Jasmine, I love you. Jasmine, please be with me. I really love you. I will do anything for you. Are you sure? Yes. Okay, go and chase the bus to the next stop. Krishna, faster! Run faster. Hey, Kong. Where is the bus? Hey, Krishna, why can't I see you? Where are you? Our bus is now on Kai Lok Estate. Kai Lok Street. This bus doesn't pass there. Faster! Come on! Hey, Krishna. Jasmine, I love you. Are you out of your mind? You're making me so uncomfortable. If you have nothing to do, go find a job! Please stop harassing me. I won't tell your family because we are neighbors. It's so embarrassing. Would you please leave me alone? You are embarrassing me right now. Krishna. I didn't expect this from you. Put your hand away. Why didn't you tell me that you're in love with Jasmine? Even if I told you, what could you do? Look, this is not India. This is Hong Kong. Hong Kong people are sensitive. Love is love. It's the same in Hong Kong or India. It's good that she didn't report it to the police or tell Dad. If Dad knows about this, you'll be in big trouble. Dad always shouts at me. He'll just shout a bit more. It's fine. Are you mad? Who proposes by chasing after a bus? I love her. Isn't it a good reason? Do you think this is a movie? I asked Jasmine not to tell anybody, but promise me, you won't trouble her anymore. Listen. Do you really love Jasmine? What do you mean? Well. If Jasmine becomes my sister-in-law, it'll be awesome. Yes, nice. Beautiful, very good. Good. Sorry, excuse me. Why are you here? I need to talk to you. Excuse me. Let's get married now. After we get married, you can still be a student and model. I thought we agreed to wait until I've graduated. Okay. Forget about what I said. But can you tell me what the Indian jerk did to you on the bus? So that's why you are here? Don't worry about him. I'm going to kill him! Are you crazy? I'm working now. I don't care. I've seen the video. That Indian freak took advantage of you. Why didn't you tell me? Who allows you to take this kind of photo? I told you many times to quit this modeling job. This is a proper job. A proper job in this dress? You don't have to sell your body for money. Watch your words! There's nothing between us. Don't exaggerate things. The more you deny it, the more obvious that you are lying. Talk some senses or don't talk at all. I don't want to wait anymore, okay? No! No, stop! - Beat it! - Richard! Beat you, your luck comes to the end. Beat your hand, your leg, beat you until you can't breathe. - I bet Richard will stay away from her. - Beat your ears, mind your words. Beat your dirty eyes, beat every part of your filthy soul. He is so dead! Very soon, you will die. Don't talk trash. Beat you, contemptible man. - Good! - Good! - Great! - One, two, three, done. Hey! I think Richard will be done for. He'll leave Jasmine soon. I don't think so. Hey, put it over there. Okay. Let's play. Krishna, you made it. Jasmine will leave Richard for sure. But I didn't make any wish. Fine. Why are we here? Let's wait. The show is about to start. Don't make any trouble. I told you. I'll give them a lesson. After that, I'll send these savage Indians back to where they came from. I already slapped him on the bus and he has stopped bothering me. Come on. What? Are you really falling in love with him? Who is Krishna? Richard sent me to warn you. Stay away from Jasmine. I won't bother her anymore. It's not going to happen again. You'd better stay away from her. Hello? Richard wants to talk to you. Hello. - Yes. - Hey! How about this? Tell him to stay away from Jasmine. You jerk, are you messing with me? Lucky that it's cold. Beat him! Hey, don't fight! Don't let him run away. Stop fighting. Easy, let's talk. Don't hit him, man! Krishna, go! Calm down. Krishna, go! - I'm your friend. - You cheat your friend like this? Stop fighting! Krishna, go! Stop! - Don't fight. - Don't hurt him. - Stop it. - Let go of him. Come over here. They're busy. Don't interrupt them. Hey! Stop! Or else, I will hurt her. Send your men away. Split. Go! Are you happy? Jasmine, come here. I said come here! I'm not coming. You'd better leave. You won't? I'll leave then. You'd better watch out. You are next. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Krishna, are you okay? Have you lost your mind? Why were you threatening Jasmine? I was trying to save you. I had no choice. Are you all right? Jasmine. When I first saw you, I've already fallen in love with you. When you looked at me, I thought that you also liked me. I thought that it was a sign from God, so I followed you everywhere. But... when you slapped me on the bus, I realized that I meant nothing to you. Jasmine, this is not your fault. I deserve it. I didn't like living in Hong Kong. I always wanted to go back to India. However, after I met you, my whole world has changed. I want to stay in Hong Kong to be with you. My mom always told me. If I love someone, I must express it in time. But I didn't know how to approach you in a nice way like the others. So I used my own way to approach you and it made you feel bad. I don't know. I'm just an uncouth fellow. My dad left us in India when I was small. Then when I came here, he always says that I am a failure. I never cared about what he said until now. When I stand before you, I finally realized that I am indeed a failure. You are such a nice girl. I know I don't deserve you, but I also know Richard is not right for you. As someone who cares about you, I urge you not to compromise and be with the wrong person. Ordinary people like me always dream of having a wife as pretty as a movie star. But in fact, when you turn off the light, every woman is beautiful. But what I like about you is your inner beauty, your personality, and your kindness. I love everything about you. People here are so busy to care about others, but you are different. You care. You understand people's pain. Unfortunately, I am not the one you want. I am not used to apologizing, but you are such a decent girl. So, I want to apologize to you. I hope you will forgive me. I've been giving you trouble. I promise you. From this day onward, I will not bother you. I will pretend that we have never met. I won't embarrass you again. I'm sorry, Jasmine. It's so smelly. Where are we going? I don't want to see you. You smell really bad. I'm throwing away the garbage. Of course it smells. I'm sorry. My dad is sick. We all have to work, so we're taking him to a home for the elderly. Sorry for troubling you. No need to apologize. We understand. Only you guys don't mind. The other neighbors were complaining. It's so smelly! Home. I want to go home. Dad, keep it down. We can't take care of you. You always bring trouble. See? You did it again. He doesn't seem willing to go. I want to go home! Hey. You don't have an elderly at home. If you do, you would understand how hard it is. Sir. There's a saying, "Elderly parents are pleasures." It's "Elderly parents are treasures." Anyways, we won't send our parents to a home. We would take care of them ourselves. You should treasure the fact that your dad is still with you. I mean, you'd better think again. Don't regret it when he is gone. - I have to go. - Thank you. It's smelly. Home. Let's go home. Let's go home. Krishna. Sorry. Jasmine! Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. How long have you been waiting? Not too long. You're stalking me again. No. I just wanted to talk to you. I want us to be friends. Can we be friends? No, we can't. I don't want you to get it wrong. Please listen to me. Krishna. It's impossible. We are from two different worlds. Think about it. We have different circles. Our living styles are different. Our backgrounds are different. We are like an "X," pointing in different directions. It's just that we met somehow. I don't want you to waste your time on me. Jasmine! Why didn't you tell me earlier? I really love you. I can't live without you. I would do anything for you. Every moment, every second, I'm thinking of you. I can't stop thinking of you. Tell me. In this world, who will miss you like I do? Your mom? She doesn't always think of you like I do. I don't need you to love me, but at least let me be your friend. I'll be very happy. Jasmine. I'll tell you one more time. I would do anything for you. Mom. - Hey, you're back. - Yes. - Have you eaten yet? - Yes, I have. - Let me help you. - Okay, here. Mom. Do you think of me all the time? You are my daughter. Of course I do. Then how many times do you think of me each day? What's wrong with you? How many times? Why are you asking this? - Answer me, please. - Silly. What? How many times? You're my daughter. Just know that I think of you. Isn't that enough? I have so many things to do. Don't think too much. You know how hard our lives are. All you need to do is focus on your studies, okay? Okay. Finish your studies as soon as possible, then find a job. And listen to me. Get married to Richard soon. Then I'll be at ease. If your dad was still alive, I wouldn't need to worry so much. Let me help you. Do you miss Dad? Of course. How can I not miss him? Why did you marry Dad? I knew he loved me. And I knew that in this world, there would be nobody else who would love me like he did. He promised me. Whatever I asked, whatever I wanted, he would try his best to do it. Can you hear that? It is that boy I heard him He said he thinks of me every second Is that okay To be with this boy Can I love him? He said he loves me, but I'm scared That day, he insulted me, calling me Chinese noodle Remember when I was dancing blindfolded, I didn't want to hold him Me and him wanted to evade but kept seeing every day Perhaps my heart cares about him being around This guy is not that bad actually Dear God, are you playing me? This guy, good or bad, he makes me happy This guy is not that bad actually Another guy, can he be trusted? Will this guy really bring me happiness? Let's see with my heart I don't even know if it's true or not If this is true love, there's no need to be afraid Can I really fall in love with him? I'd better say no Don't think about me and him Don't have too many thoughts I should not love him Is it okay To be with this boy Endless sweet words, I am surprised by his love Should I trust his words? True or not, will we have a future? My son, how's your business? It's very good, Dad. I'll be promoted next month. Good. Brother. Can I come with you? I can help your business. What's the rush? Let's decide next time. You will make your decision overnight? Son. Before you decide, think carefully. Yes, think carefully. You can't just quit once you get started. Bring him along. Since he asked to come. Quick, he may change his mind. Okay, 7 a.m. tomorrow. Krishna, your phone is ringing. Who is it? If it's King Kong, I won't take it. It's Jasmine. Jasmine? "Baby." Hello? Hello. Hi, this is Jasmine. I asked your sister for your number. - Yes? - Are you at home? Yes, I'm at home. Is there anyone around you? No. Are you free tomorrow at 7 a.m.? Yes, I am free. I'll be free at 7 a.m. tomorrow. See you tomorrow at 7 a.m. at Wah Fu Waterfall. - Okay. - Hello? Okay, bye. Bye. Guess that means you're not coming with me. Stop laughing. Eat! Check out the photos. Good. Let's continue. What happens if it goes in? If it goes in, Richard will marry you. But you're lucky, none went in. Krishna. I have something to tell you. Please don't misunderstand. It's impossible between us. Krishna. Krishna. I've been noticing you for a while. You have a kind heart. You only need someone to advise you. Don't waste your time on those meaningless things. Go and find a job. What kind of job then? What can you do? Jasmine, I've tried so many kinds of jobs. I could be a bell boy at a hotel or work at McDonald's. Are you good at driving motorbikes and have a good sense of direction? Yes. I have a friend who is a restaurant manager. I can ask her to hire you as a delivery guy. How does that sound? Sounds good to me. Sorry, I'm late. Don't you know it's a job interview? I know. Then why are you dressed like this and arrived late? Your hair. Here. Fix it. - Hi. - Hi, Michelle. It has been a while. I need a favor from you. What can I do for you? This is my friend, Krishna. He is looking for a job. See if you can hire him as a delivery guy. Well, I'm sorry. I don't think he is suitable. But why? Well, to be frank, we don't hire South Asians. It also seems that he has no experience. It's not true. Trust me. He's an amazing driver. He can do this. Why don't you give him a try? Okay. I'll give him a chance. You are the best. Be there on time. This is the address. Send this pizza here. Thank you so much, Michelle. Stay in touch - Okay, bye. - Bye. Why did it take so long? Give it to me. I wasn't late. There was a traffic jam. Don't make excuses. Where's my coke? Where is it? I probably left it in the restaurant. I'm sorry. What? You drank my coke? What are you talking about? I didn't drink it. Don't pull an attitude with me. You got the wrong items and you were late. Useless, you idiot! You people make Hong Kong sink. Let me tell you. You Indians are all the same. It must have been you who drank my coke. I will not pay this bill, loser! Hello, Michelle! Hi, Jasmine. I got a complaint from a customer about your friend. And he didn't come back to the restaurant. Please tell your friend that he doesn't need to come back. And please don't recommend this kind of people to me anymore. I'm sorry, Michelle. I'm really sorry. Press one to leave a message. Hello, Kong. Good night. You've been drinking? I'm so sorry, Jasmine. I know that you want to help me get back on my feet and you encouraged me. But I really think I'm not worth it. In fact, my dad is right. I'm such a loser. No, you're not. Didn't you see us giving you an applause? You guys were just trying to make me feel better. Are you okay? Wipe it up. Seriously, you danced quite well. Right, Kong? Yes. You learned it before? You've got talent. I have talent? I have talent. Well. I learned dancing with Lily when we were small. But everyone said that she danced much better, so I gave up dancing. Speaking of which, I wasn't dancing actually. I was just horsing around. Happy or sad, I drink with Kong. Then I come here and chill out. Dancing? Now that you are done chilling out, are you feeling better now? After drinking, I feel much better and happy. I feel like I can fly. Don't fly. Stand still. Actually, your movements are really good. Be more confident. Promise me. Don't drink anymore. Come and learn dancing with me. Will you? Promise me or you will never see me again. Jasmine. I promise you. I won't drink again. I will learn dancing with you. You're something. You can make promises when you're that drunk. Take him home. It's going to rain. Okay. Let's go. Gosh, you are heavy. Don't speak Hindi. I don't understand. Let's go. No more pebble-throwing game? Let's play a new game. What is it? Let's do role-playing. You'll be me and I'll be you. Sure. Come on. Jasmine! I love you. Please be with me. I would do anything for you. Are you really sure you would do anything for me? Sure! Then please stop bothering me. What can you do? Would you jump into the sea to prove your love? It's unacceptable. You follow me wherever I go. What is your problem? Who do you think you are? Can you get off the bus and get back on at the next stop? Jasmine. I can't jump out of the bus now. If I die, nobody will take care of you. Are you crazy? You would do anything for me? Is that your only goal in life? That is why you did such things? It's impossible, me and you. I'm engaged to Richard. I kept silent these days because your family knows me. I don't want to embarrass you. You made me so embarrassed. Don't bother me again, please. I don't want to see you. So? Was my acting good? Jasmine. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry. It's just a game. Sorry, Jasmine. Sorry. Krishna. I like you. Oh my pretty, my love I am yours, my dear My life is with you You are my heart, you are my life Hala halai lala, you're my happiness Hala halai lala, you're my life Since you became my love, I found paradise To be with you, every second my heart tells me Hala halai lala, you're my happiness Hala halai lala, you're my life The anklet makes A sweet sound The anklet makes a sweet sound With you, my love is initiated With you, my heart is infatuated With you, every problem is solved With you, I can conquer the world My prayers have been answered I found you, I found my destiny I live for you, you are my life You are my heart, you are my life Hala halai lala, you're my happiness Hala halai lala, you're my life What are you doing? I'm planning to go for an interview at Ocean Park. Do you think they'll hire you just because you know a few tricks? Don't waste your time. Hey, Krishna. Bye, Auntie. Bye. Are you going out? Hold on. I need to ask you something. Have you been seeing that Indian boy lately? Sweetie, you two can't be together. Don't be a fool, okay? But I love him, Mom. Are you serious? What about Richard? He helped us a lot. And you promised to marry him. Don't you remember? Talking about Richard, he only took advantage of Jasmine. How did he help? What do you know? Keep your mouth shut. If anything happens to her, are you going to help? Will you take care of her? But you can't ask her to go against her own will. Against her will? She's still young. I'm teaching her. Please keep your mouth shut! What's so great about that Indian boy? He's unemployed. He doesn't know Cantonese. He can't survive here. You'll have no future with him. He can't support your life. Do you want to follow him to India? Do you know what kind of place it is? People are poor, there are no jobs, places are dirty, and it has high crime rates. - Do you want these? - It's not true. I think India is great. I've been there several times and I came back in one piece. It's different now. In our time, all we cared about was money and riches. Now, we should live in the moment. Jasmine, you're a grown woman. It's time to decide on your own future. Shut up! I'm teaching my daughter. Don't interrupt me! Sit down! I'm telling you, no matter who's on your side, stop listening to her. I'm your mom. I won't allow you to be with that Indian boy. Understand? I'm calling Richard for you. Mom. Mom! I really love him. I don't mind if his Cantonese is bad or how unstable his job is. Trust me. He'll catch up. Jasmine. Do you know what you're talking about? Can you listen to me just once? Can you just trust me? Mom. I've tried. Richard isn't right for me. I raised you. And now you go against me for this Indian boy? Do you know what life is? All these years, you don't need to worry about anything because your dad and I took care of everything. Don't you know? Be careful. These are eggs. Don't break them. What are you holding? Papa, I got a job at Ocean Park. What? I got a job at Ocean Park. I'm not a loser anymore. I'm going to the bank to pay the rent. Take the food home first. I've paid the rent already. - Bharthi. - Yes? After Krishna met that girl, he changed a lot. It's all right. But what if he wants to marry her? Our living style is different, eating style is different. And by the way, Krishna doesn't like eating noodles. So what? He's in love with her. What's the problem? No. I hope he'll marry one of our relatives' daughters. You know, like Deepika or Priyanka. They are beautiful and polite girls. They even cook very well. If he chooses any one of them, everything will be fine. I don't think he'll be happy. How can you be so sure that he'll be happy marrying that Chinese girl? There wasn't any guarantee when we both got married. I was the one who handled everything properly. Indian wife. Stupid! He's in love with her. He changed a lot. Dear. May I ask you something? What's that? Will they pay us dowry? This is Hong Kong. It's very rude to ask for it. Well! But you took it from my family. How much did your family give? Two thousand only, Hong Kong Dollars. In those days. In Hong Kong, it's different. It's the other way around. We have to pay to the girl's family. My gosh! I'm just joking. We're modern people. We don't even talk about dowry. Nothing happens! Jasmine. Hey. What's the matter? I have something to tell you. What is it? These days, being with you, I felt very happy. Jasmine. Don't scare me. What's wrong? I felt very happy. Let me finish first. I feel contented. You're such a nice person. Many people have misunderstood you. I would be really lucky if I could be with you. Jasmine. Why are you saying this? Did I do something wrong? No, you didn't. You're very good. Jasmine. I was irresponsible and bad-mannered in the past. - You made me understand... - No, you're good. Don't be like this. I'm sorry, Jasmine. No, you're so good. And I've been so happy. I'm the one who doesn't deserve you. It's not your problem. You've done nothing wrong. Well, I don't know how to say it. But my mom... What are you saying? Our relationship has nothing to do with your mom. Tell me. You told me to quit smoking and drinking. I gave them all up already. You want to leave me now? Do you? Are you playing with me? No, Krishna. It's because I'm poor, right? Stop treating me like a fool. Krishna, you are awake. I was so worried. I'm glad you're fine now. Just rest. I'll go and get your dad. Jasmine. What? What did you say? I want to see Jasmine. Just rest first! Let me find your dad. He's outside on the phone. Your mom is talking with the doctor. Rest a bit and don't move, okay? I want to see Jasmine. She's fine. She's resting now. You should rest too. What are you doing? Why are you getting up? I want to see Jasmine. Don't go anywhere. You are still weak. You just woke up from a coma. Fine, I'll help you. Take it slow. Hey. That hurt. Krishna. Jasmine. Jasmine. Jasmine. Jasmine. Krishna, where are you going? Jasmine. Why don't you take these? - Hey! - Jasmine. Jasmine. - Jasmine. - I'm sorry. Thank you. Jasmine. Hey, are you insane? I'm sorry. - Jasmine. - Where are you going? Jasmine. Just rest a bit, will you? Jasmine. Jasmine. Krishna! Papa, I want to see her. Papa. Jasmine. Jasmine is dead! Jasmine. All my happiness is because of you Only you in my life Without you now, there is nothing Without you, my breath has stopped My life is in darkness I found you and I found my light My heartbeats were linked to yours Without you, how should I live now? This path is incomplete, this journey is incomplete You are my guide, you are my path I cannot take one step without you You are my life partner, I am destined to be with you I love you. Please be with me. Wherever I look, you are there Without you, I cannot live Let go of your fears for me. Or we should never meet again. How can I separate from you? Krishna. I know you want to go back to India. You do whatever that makes you feel happy. I lost myself, Papa. I can't focus on anything. I just want to die. Hello. Have a seat. Have a seat. My son? My son? - Have a drink. - Thank you. Saying goodbye is never easy. You feel sad because you are living in your memory. Krishna. I know you are devastated, but you can't keep being like this, okay? I've never liked you. I'm not even sure why I came here today to talk to you. But I know that you really loved Jasmine and she really loved you. Krishna. In fact, I was very surprised that Jasmine was able to make you a better person. So prove it to yourself. Make her proud to have confidence in you, okay? Your parents need you. Please don't give up on yourself. I'm very sorry. Please don't let Jasmine down. Krishna. I'm really sorry. I know I shouldn't have put you two in such pain. I shouldn't have given such a test to you and Jasmine. I've also put your family in such great torment. I'm sorry. Actually, Krishna, Jasmine is not dead. She's in the hospital now, but she's in a coma. Krishna. It's true! Jasmine is barely holding on. If it wasn't because of your son, she wouldn't have been in an accident. Do you understand? Can you just tell your son to leave my daughter alone? Ask him to let her go. Okay? She is all I have now. I beg you. What if... What if you tell Krishna that Jasmine is dead? Only then, will he leave Jasmine alone. I beg you. I only have one daughter. I don't want anything else to happen to her. I can't live without her. I beg you. Tell your son not to see her again. Tell him Jasmine is dead. She's dead. I beg you. I can't lose Jasmine. I beg you. I found Jasmine's diary in her room the other day. I didn't like you before. I thought you were a bad influence and you were giving her trouble. I thought that she wasn't serious and your relationship wouldn't last. I was worried she would be led astray by you and you'd drag her down. In fact, I was wrong. Look. My Indian Boyfriend After I met you, I realized what love means. I am happy to watch you grow up and become a responsible person. You are my love and I will never forget you. I know that my boyfriend, Krishna, is a good person. He always listens to me. I hope that I will dream of you every day. I love you. Jasmine. I miss you so much. I knew you weren't dead. You came back. I love you so much. Please don't leave me, Jasmine. Once I held in my arms was my loved one Indulge in sweet memories with you It's all my fault for pushing you too hard Once I have promised, but now we are apart I didn't know what love was, but now I have your love If I make you angry, don't ask me to let you go I miss you every day, but I've let you down I hate myself for hurting you My heart will die without you My boyfriend is bad, indeed Doctor. Doctor. Doctor, Jasmine is awake. Don't worry. She is fine. This is good news. Just relax. Jasmine. I really miss you, Jasmine. I really love you. Don't leave me. Please. Please don't leave me. I really love you. I can't live without you. You've made me a better person. Jasmine. Jasmine, I miss you so much. Everyone said you died. I didn't listen. I really love you. Please don't leave me. There is no Krishna without Jasmine. Honey. What are you thinking about? I just had a dream. We had two cute babies, a curry boy and a wonton girl. Well, you can't have babies just by dreaming. I am so intoxicated by love That I have forgotten everything My eyes search everywhere for A glimpse of you Baby, you know me, I really love you! You are my beloved! Baby, please hold me, I want to hug you You are my everything My heart was useless But your love made me crazy I was a nomad, roaming without any purpose Your love has made me a responsible person The earth and the sky are for you All the happiness is only because of you I breathe for you My heart beats for you My life Is only for you I lost my heart at first sight I found the world in her arms I was lost but then found my way In love! I will save you in my memories I only dream of you every night Now I can win everything In love! I will not listen to anybody I will fight the whole world I will tear down all the walls In love! I will always keep you in my eyes I will protect you, I will keep you in my heart Every moment from now, I will only love you In love!
