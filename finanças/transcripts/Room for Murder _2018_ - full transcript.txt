[siren wailing] [tires screeching] [indistinct radio chatter] [dramatic music] 12-44. Officer down, officer down, officer down. [indistinct radio chatter] [music continues] [mellow music] [birds chirping] [cell phone vibrates] Hey, Mom. I'm not in Berkeley. What? What are you talking about? I thought your new job started today. Change of plans. [chuckles] So, what are you up to? Surprise! Oh, my God! What are you doing here? I'm crawling back home with my tail between my legs. What? What happened? There is no new job. Budget cuts at the university. I got the call yesterday. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. Well, aren't you happy to see me? Are you kidding? -Christmas in July! -Okay, okay. Don't suffocate me. I have been driving all night. I probably smell like a homeless person. Yeah. [chuckles] You look great, Mom. Youthful. I'm just happy to see you. How long are you staying? I don't know. A few weeks. Or until we both die of old age and get eaten by cats and raccoons. Okay. Well, let's hope it's just a couple of weeks then. [chuckles] I'm just gonna go drop the stuff in my room, then shower, and we can catch up on everything. Kristen, there's something I need to tell you. Hey there. You must be Kristen. Um, yeah. Who are you? Mom, why is there a barefoot man on my bed? Oh, honey, I've been meaning to tell you. I rented out your room. I'm sorry. I, I thought she knew. Mm. [clears throat] You know what, I will, uh, leave you two. I got some work to do outside. [Moira] Okay. Okay. So how did you not tell me this? [chuckles] We speak twice a day. Mm, I didn't wanna worry you. I'm not worried. -He's really cute. -Isn't he? It's like if the J. Crew catalog and the Kennedy Compound had a love child. But why do you need a boarder? Mm, well, some money issues. What? Um, what about the beauty shop? I thought you were having a great year. I am. I'm just always in the red somehow. You know I suck at the business side of things. I'll come look at your books tomorrow. -Would you? -Yes. And I'll try and find another living situation. No! No, you don't have to do that. Just stay on the couch. You sure you don't wanna Airbnb that, too? -Mm-mm, funny. -[chuckles] I'm serious. Is it not weird having some random guy around? No, he's handy, he's been helping to refurbish some of the old furniture, cleaning up the shed. You did your due diligence on him. -Of course. -Really? So you've checked his references, his previous employers, his FICO score-- Sure. Sure, sure, sure. -Liar. -How do you know I didn't? Because you're you. At best, you checked his astrology chart. [Moira] Well, he is a Gemini. And you know I always get along with Geminis. -Mom, be serious. -I did. I-I called his former employer, and he got a glowing review. -[Moira] Okay? -Okay. -That's something. -Yeah. [Moira] Do me a favor. -Take this out to him. -Why? Because I know you're curious as hell, and I want you to get to know him. -Fine. Twist my arm. -Oh, you, can you, uh... Can you go through your stuff at some point? I-I just, I boxed everything up and I put it out there. Just to make room for him. You're gonna clear that space and make it a spa for your guests? [scoffs] Just do it, smart-ass. Off you go. [mellow music] Hey there. Hey. Mom wanted you to have this. Oh. Uh, great. You can just set it right there. -Okay. -Thanks. Hey, sorry about earlier. I-I just, I had no idea she hadn't told you. Don't worry about it. It's just another curve ball. It'll all fall into place. What? Your life. I know exactly where you are right now. You graduate and there's this big abyss in front of you and it can be terrifying. Yeah. That. The big abyss. You'll find your focus. And how do you know? You just met me. Well, your mom does say that you're the smartest person she knows, so... Clearly, she needs to get out more. You know, sometimes you just need to trust the universe. I think great things are gonna happen for you. Well, I hope you're right. You have a really beautiful smile. Okay, well, I am going to go back to Planet Earth right now. But thanks for the positivity. Anytime. [sighs] [crickets chirping] [doorknob clicks] [dramatic music] [music continues] -[chuckles] -Mm. [sighs] [exhales sharply] [birds chirping] [sighs] [gasps] Oh, my God. Good mornin'. Oh, come on in. Plenty of room. I'll just come back. [Moira chuckles] -What? -[laughs] You're so quiet this morning. Don't you have to get to work soon? I do, but I just wanna spend a little alone time with you. -[sighs] -What? Oh, my God, Mom. -You heard us last night? -Yeah. Oh, my God. It was really hard not to. Sorry, honey. I did not mean for you to find out this way. How old do you think he is? I don't know, 25, 26? You get that's, like, two years older than me, right? So what? It's not like I'm gonna marry him. Well, at least not anytime soon. -Mom! -Well... I thought you'd be happy for me. -Really? -Yes. I mean, you're always encouraging me to, to get out there and start dating. Yes, out there and dating. You're not doing that, you're hooking up with a random boy that you found inside your house. No, no, no, no, he's not a boy. Trust me. He's very much a man. -Ugh... -In bed. Mom, stop! My God! My ears are bleeding. -What, are you jealous? -Excuse me? Oh, come on. You just haven't been dating that much. Are you serious? If I wanted to hook up for random sex, I have plenty of opportunity. I just don't like the way it makes me feel. It's not like that. No, it's not. He's, he's tender and he's... He's just so in the moment when we're in bed. Are you forgetting that I'm your daughter? Oh, come on. We always talk about your sex life. I'm just really blind-sided by this whole situation. All right, well, would you just stop your judgement for just five seconds and try to be happy for me? Come on, he makes me feel young and alive and... desirable. [scoffs] Is there really anything wrong with that? No. No. Do people at work know? I don't think so. [instrumental music playing on stereo] Good morning. Buenos dias, Mrs. Robinson. Ah-ah! -So, are you... -Shh-shh. And Jake... What? Ah! -[laughing] Hi, baby! -Yay! [indistinct chatter] -Hi! -Hi! You look so beautiful! [laughing] I thought you started your new job. -It fell through. -Oh, bendito, I'm sorry. I bet you'll find something new soon, you know? Yeah. I already applied to other programs. Yeah, that's the spirit. You'll get something soon. You want me to do your hair? Kristen is here in a professional... -...capacity today. -Oh, really? She's gonna go over my books and tell me why I can barely afford my mortgage every month. Mm. That's really easy. Hm. It's because your mother lives beyond her means. Okay. Why don't you go sit on a curling iron? I would love to. Yeah. [laughs] -Mom? -Hm. -What is this? -What? You seriously need a bookkeeper. -Why? I have you. -Ugh. Stop hovering. Oh, come on. What's the verdict? Guilty of extreme negligence of your finances. [Kristen] You over-schedule all of your employees. Everyone that works here is getting overtime hours. That's crazy. [Moira] All right, well... What would you do? Stagger their hours, keep everyone down to a 40-hour work week. [doorbell rings] Hey! What are you doing here? [sighs] Hey there. Can I, uh, just steal you for a minute? Uh, yeah. -Hey there. -Hey. [clears throat] -Hey. -Hey! I just have a little favor to ask you. Yeah. What do you need? -Payroll's being super slow. -Hm. Can I get you the rent next week? Yeah, no problem. -Thanks. -[giggles] [doorbell rings] I mean, yeah, he's attractive, but I just can't go there MJ, I can't. And this morning I come in to the bathroom and he's in a towel and he coyly invites me inside with him. Bold move. Damn. Sounds like Moira got her groove back. -Mm. -You don't approve? No. I don't trust him. Or you can't deal with your mom having sex. Stop. No, I don't care about that. I really don't. Look, I'm not blaming you. I just think Moira has earned the right to have a little fun. I mean, think about the years she worked to put you through school. Oh, I know, you're right. I'm trying to be happy for her, but... I think you should give the guy a chance. What about Ryan? Have you seen him? What are the chances I can avoid him all summer? Zero to nil. Please. I mean, he comes in here sometimes. I gotta say he looks pretty good in uniform. I'm sure he does. What about work? What are you doing? I don't know. I was helping my mom this morning, but... -You know, just come work here. -What? [MJ] Seriously, I need somebody. The girl who works the morning shift, she's like, having a baby or something. Just come work here. -Yeah? -It'll be so fun. -Okay, I'm down. -Yes! You'd look good in uniform, too. -[chuckles] -And it'll be so fun! -I know. -[laughs] Really? You're blocking me? I saw your car. -How long are you in town for? -Until I can plot my escape. [chuckles] I cannot believe they're allowing you to wear a uniform. Hey, crime rates are down since I've been with the department, all right? That's 'cause you're off the streets now. Yeah, you got that right. You look good, Kris. -Don't start. -What? Come on, I'm being serious. Have a drink with me later. You think I was hit over the head and woke up with amnesia? I've changed, you know? It's been five years, Ryan. I've moved on. Really? Have you? Because you, uh, you seem a little glad to see me right now. Fine. Why don't you text me later? -Still got the same number? -Yeah. [Ryan] Hm, 'cause I've tried to text you before and it didn't work. Hm. I might have to unblock you. Oh, yeah. Go ahead. I'll wait. Done. All right. I'll talk to you later then. Hey. You do look good in that uniform. Yeah. I know. [scoffs] You know, all this time and I had no idea that you even knew how to cook. I mean, honestly, I thought that burned, baked goods were really more your specialty. [Moira] Hey, look, my culinary skills might be a little limited, but mac and cheese has always been Kristen's favorite. -So... -Mm-hmm, when I was 12. I'm kidding. Still really tasty. Mm. How's MJ? She's great. She offered me a job at the cafe. -[Kristen] I start tomorrow. -Mm, that's good. You'll have something to do while you're here. [Kristen] Yeah. Is it weird being back in Riverview? A little. [clears throat] What about you? Uh, what about me? How'd you end up here? Well... the town kinda found me, to be honest. I was working on Wall Street for a couple of years. He was a vice president. Ev-everybody was a vice president. You weren't happy doing that? I was seduced by it in the beginning. You know, the fancy suits, the expense accounts... You know, frankly, the easy money, but, uh... Then I found myself working 70-hour weeks and... having panic attacks. So I got my car and I drove until I thought that my, uh, past was in my rearview mirror, I ended up here. Became a loan officer at the bank. And, honestly, I've never been happier. You just left everything behind in New York? I had a roommate. Yeah, he's got most of my stuff still. Hm. What about friends, family, a girlfriend? What are you, Oprah? It's a lot of questions. I don't mind. My parents died when I was young. I've got a brother, but, uh, we're not close. To be honest, I, uh, I always felt pretty alone until I met Moira. -What about you? -Me? Yeah. Do you have a, you know, plan? I'm going to apply to a few more teaching programs. I'd really love to open my own psych practice one day. But, I don't know, someone once told me you just have to trust the universe sometimes. Have you ever thought about settling here? I-I know your mother would absolutely love-- -Uh... -[Moira] Yes. No, I'm more of a big-city girl. What, Riverview's too boring for you? I just prefer city life. Okay. So, does anyone want dessert? I made a Bundt cake, and Kristen even brought an Ethiopian blend from MJ's shop. You know what? I think, uh, I'm gonna go on a run. Let you two ladies catch up. What was that all about? You wanted me to get to know him. You're fishing, honey, and I don't know why. Jake is really a sweet guy. Is that why you're letting him slide on the rent? I'm not. He's gonna be one week late. [Moira] What do you care? I just don't want him taking advantage of you. Please. If anything, it's the other way around. Ugh! Seriously? You did not just wink at me, Mom. -[Kristen] Did you? -[laughing] [cell phone message alert] Oh, my God... [send alert] Sorry. I think I'm gonna head out in a few minutes. Mm. Hot date? -Um, yeah. -[message alert] -It's Ryan. -You're kidding. We're just going for a drink. And he said he's changed. Well, that's what cheaters always say. [music continues] -Here you go, guys. -Thank you. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Cheers. To your homecoming. -Thank you. -Welcome back. [chuckles] Hey, I gotta be honest, I'm actually a little surprised you showed up tonight. Yeah. I needed to get out of that house. How is Moira? She still hates me, doesn't she? Yeah, she does. Bitch knows how to hold a grudge. Ah. Like mother, like daughter, am I right? Hm. No, no. When I slept with that girl, you weren't returning my phone calls. That's because I was on the way to Northwestern and I needed some time to sort things out. I was confused. It doesn't give you a hall pass to sleep with another girl. You're right. I'm not saying it does. Okay? I'm just trying to explain what happened. Okay, it doesn't even matter. Why are we talking-- Yes, it does. Okay? Look, it matters to me. I hated myself for what I did. Come on, what we had... I've just, I've never found it with anyone else. -You missed me. -I did. I'm not gonna lie. And I'd give anything to have it back. -It's not gonna happen. -Why? I'm only in town for a short amount of time. Well, we better get started then. [chuckles] You are relentless. -You still have feelings for me. -Mm. -Mm. I do? -Mm-hmm. And how would you guess that? Because you wouldn't be here tonight if you didn't. Actually, I was hoping you could do a background check on someone for me. -A background check? -Mm-hmm. -On who? -My mom has this boarder. I don't trust him. So that's why you came tonight? So I would do you a favor. Here we go. Okay, Ryan, what did you expect, that I was gonna sleep with you? That that would make me forgive you? I don't know. -It might help. -Geez. -No? -No! Well, I tried. I should go. Are you sure? Are you okay to drive? I had two beers. Okay, what? Are you gonna arrest me? I will let it slide this time. Then I'm leaving. But thank you for the drinks. You're welcome. Bye. [message alert] [footsteps approaching] [dramatic music] [Moira] Where were you last night? I was hoping you'd come upstairs. Sorry, babe, I was just so tired after the run, I could barely move. You came home kinda late. [Jake] Yeah, you know, I was just, I was just running for a while... Lost track of time. [Kristen] Good morning. Hey, sweetie. You want some eggs? -No. Just coffee. -Okay. How was your run? Uh, um... Excuse me? What? Your run. Oh, uh, fine. [indistinct radio chatter] [car honks] [siren wailing] -Have a good one. -Thank you. [sighs] Why isn't Ryan texting me back? Maybe 'cause you left him at the bar with his ... in his hand. Ah, speak of the devil. You wanted to speak with me? What happened in the woods last night? Wow! Good morning to you, too. Can I get a coffee, MJ? -Thank you. -What happened? It was a female jogger. She was assaulted and strangled. It was him. Kris, careful what you say. Jake. My mom's boarder. On the way home, someone came running out of the woods last night, and his eyes were all crazy. -It was him. -Are you sure it was him? -[Kristen] Yes. -A 100 percent? No... No, I'm not a 100 percent sure, but-- I'm just saying you shouldn't make accusations without having any proof, all right? No. I know in my gut. It was him. I have to get back to work. Thank you for the coffee. I'm not wrong. I believe you. [birds chirping] Hello? Anyone home? [dramatic music] [music continues] What the hell are you doing? Oh, hey! I didn't hear you come in. I was just looking for one of my old sweaters. I wasn't anticipating this weather. They're in a box in the shed. I think your mother told you that. Did she? I didn't hear that. I'm sorry for invading your space. [sighs] Uh, what are you doing here so early? I spilled something on my tie. You drove all the way home for a new tie? Yes. Okay. I guess I'll just go and check in the shed then. You really should mind your own business. Or what? You don't wanna find out. He's a total creep. I want you to check him out. Drop by later? I am using you. Do you have a problem with that? -[Moira] Kristen? -I'm here. See you later. Hey, you need help? No, I'm just trying to get this stuff organized. [Moira] Mm. [Kristen] I forgot what a little jock I was. Oh, those uniforms cost a fortune. That's what you remember? Oops! Stop. I was so proud of you. Are you gonna stay for dinner? I'm making chicken and couscous. -Couscous? -Mm-hmm. Trying new things. [chuckles] Sounds great. -Mom? -Yeah? Can I talk to you about something? As long as it's not about Jake. -He threatened me. -What? -Why? -He found me in his room. He must have thought I was going through his things. -Well, were you? -No. -I was looking for a sweater. -[chuckles] Okay. Well, I boxed them up and I put them out here. I thought I told you that. I guess I didn't hear you. Well, what did he say? Told me to mind my own business. Ah, well, that doesn't sound so threatening. It was the way he said it. Like, he wanted to strangle me. You know what? You're being so dramatic. You think I'm making all this up? No, I just don't think you like him and you're trying to see the worst in him-- Well, I'm sorry, but he's put up more red flags than the Chinese embassy, and you seem completely blind to it. I'm gonna go make dinner. Did you hear about the jogger? The one that was murdered? [Moira] Yeah. It's horrible. Well, do you think Jake might have seen something? I hope you're not suggesting that he had anything to do with that. He was out jogging last night. So were dozens of other people. His workout clothes are missing. Are you being serious right now? Is that why you were in his room? Why else do you think he came home so late? Enough, Kristen. You know nothing about him. What? That automatically makes him a murderer? -Are you really siding with him? -I'm not siding with anyone. I just think you're being a little paranoid. He's on a bunch of medication. It's all hidden in his drawer. I know. He's on antidepressants. He already told me. -Who isn't these days? -I'm not. Yeah. Well, maybe you should be. Mom, I'm not finished! [cutlery clinking] [Moira clears throat] So I'm, um, thinking of closing the shop on Sundays. What do you think? Yeah? Or you could just have one person come in. Mm, they'd hate that. They love to chatter. [chuckles] Mom, they're your employees, not your friends. Oh, but they adore you over there. Okay. Well, that's not the point. The point is to keep the business profitable so Moira doesn't lose this house. Yeah, we'd never let that happen. [Moira] Kristen's exaggerating. Her imagination gets the best of her sometimes. Really? I would love to hear more examples of that. [doorbell rings] Who's that? That would be Ryan. He's taking me for a motorcycle ride. Oh. Do you think that's smart? Well, life comes with a lot of risks, doesn't it? I can't believe she's seeing him again. And who is he? Her ex-boyfriend. He's a deputy for the sheriff's department. You never mentioned him. Well, I thought he was out of the picture. Mrs. Atherton. Long time, no see. Hello, Ryan. And, Ryan, this is Jake. He's renting out my old room. -Oh, yeah. -Hey, man. -It's so nice to meet you. -You, too. Yeah, I hear you are in law enforcement. -[Jake] Yeah. Good on you. -Thanks, man. Off the clock now. You know, civilian hours. [chuckles] Ryan's actually working that jogger case. Really? You know, I was reading about that online. And it turns out, I was on the same exact path last night. Kristen told me. You didn't happen to see anything by chance, did you? No. You know, but it-it is truly scary that stuff like that happens in such... a quiet little town like this. You didn't hear anything? No, I wear, uh, headphones when I jog. Didn't you say you were off the clock, Ryan? Yeah, I did. Then maybe you should stop interrogating him. [chuckles] Didn't even realize I was doing it. -Force of habit, I guess. -I don't mind at all. Seriously, I just wish there was, there was something I could do to help. You know, I am fascinated by all this true crime stuff. I'm sure you are. Are you ready to go? -Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah? Nice to meet you. Mrs. Atherton. -Hm. -[Moira clears throat] [Kristen] So admit it, there's something weird about him, right? Yeah, but it doesn't make him a murderer. You're doing that background check for me? Yes, I told you, I will. -Okay? -Thank you. Mm, you know, I think he got off on you questioning him. -On me questioning him? -Mm-hmm. Can you just give me a little bit of time so I can build a case, please? I think I found blood on one of his sneakers. And how would you know that? I went to his closet. What were you doing in his closet? I don't know, Ryan, looking for my prom dress. No, I was looking for evidence and I found some. Kristen, please, do not get involved. I am involved. I'm living under the same roof as some psycho who's sleeping with my mom. Exactly. Okay? You're not objective. Let me take care of it. If this guy is-is as dangerous as you think he is, then the last thing you want to do is provoke him. I guess you're right. [Moira] Breakfast? -[Jake] Do you count? -[Moira chuckles] [Moira] Well, what's on the menu? [Jake moans] I wish that I didn't have to go to work today. Mm... [Jake] I should shower. [Moira] Hm. [sighs] [shower running] Damn it! [exhales sharply] [footsteps approaching] [sighs] [dramatic music] [door creaking] [Moira] Kristen? Hey, Kristen, you want coffee? -Hey! Good morning! -What you doin'? Just getting my stuff organized. -You want some? -Sure. Hm. Are you keeping these? No, I'm throwing them away. [gasps] What? All these trophies? -You worked so hard for them. -Mom, stop. Just leave it alone. It's all clutter. I don't wanna get all sentimental about it. Okay. It's your stuff. You going somewhere? I'm going to stay with MJ while I look for another place. It's feeling really crowded in here. Are you sure? I think it's for the best. [Jake clears throat] [Jake] Hey! -Morning. -Morning. -You going somewhere? -Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll give you a hand. No, I'm good. Thanks. Okay, then. You don't want help... [laughs] [scatting] Sherrie, can I talk to you for a minute? Am I in trouble? -No, of course not. -Okay. You know I adore you, right? I mean, everyone does. Mira, ..., are you firing me? Oh, stop it. -You know, I'm your top earner. -I know. -What? -Okay. It, it's just that when Kristen was here, she made a few really good points. Like-like, I-I am paying way too much on overtime. Well, the only reason why I stay late is because my clients can't come during the day. Well, maybe you could start your shift later? And we're taking too many breaks. We really need to cut back. Okay. Is this because Kristen said so? No, because I said so. -And this is my shop. -Okay? Well, we don't need three shampoo girls. Okay. -I'll look into that. -Great. Well, I was on my way to lunch, you know, if I'm still allowed to do that. Of course. Keep it under an hour. Of course. Yes, Ma'am. [sighs] [Sherrie laughs] [dramatic music] Whose laundry is this? Can you remove it from the machine, please? No? Fine. Hey! What are you doing? Can you please stop? I don't like people touching my things. Well, maybe you shouldn't leave it sitting in the machine then. Hm? -What's your problem? -Fine. You go ahead and do it. I'm not really a fan of, uh, handling your granny panties anyways. Wow. You don't have to be such a jerk. [Jake] Are you really calling me a jerk, you slovenly cow? Who do you think you are, huh? The laundry police? [woman] What's your problem? Calm down. ...! [Jake] Don't you tell me to calm down. Don't you dare tell me what to do. -[Jake] Who are you-- -Jake, papito. -What? -Is everything okay? It, it's me, Sherrie, from Moira's shop. Of course. I know. [laughs] I'm sorry, I-I've just, uh... I've been a little stressed out today, kind of lost my head there. Uh, excuse me, just a moment. Ma'am, uh, can I offer to pay for your dryer? [laughs] Mijo, it's okay, you sound like me with customer service people. -I mean, she'll get over it... -Ah! You know what, I just... Honestly, I just, I just feel embarrassed. Uh... Oh, no. Oh, I'll get that. Oh, my God. Oh, no, it's okay. I'll help you. -Is this blood? -Um... Yeah. Yeah, I-I cut myself on a branch. Really? Bendito, are you okay? -Do you need anything? -Oh, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. But, hey, you know what, can you do me a favor? And, uh, you know, don't tell Moira. You know, she gets a little over-protective. Of course. [chuckles] Mum's the word. Well, I should get back to work. You know what? [clears throat] Um... I'll give you a ride. I've got my car right out back. I-it's okay. My car is in the back. [stammers] I can drive. I really have to go. It was nice seeing you, Jake. [dramatic music] Who are you texting, Sherrie? -An Uber. -Oops. See, didn't you just tell me that you've got a car here? You really think I'm that stupid? [sighs] -You dirty liar! -[phone clatters] [grunts] Oh, let me go! -[grunts] -Ah! Help me! -[grunts] -[groans] [breathing heavily] [groaning] [grunting] [choking] Ah... [grunts] [groaning] [indistinct chatter] Hey. This one's on the house. Oh, no, I feel like there's gonna be a bunch of strings attached. I'd rather give you the three bucks. [scoffs] I actually have to show you something. -Okay. -MJ. Could you watch this for a second? But you have to promise me not to be mad. I'm making no such promises. -MJ, can you watch that? -Bring her back safe. [sighs] Kids. What the hell is that? -Evidence. -Of what? -Athlete's foot? -No. Look. That has to be blood. Okay. Put it away. This isn't CSI. We don't have a high-tech crime lab on site. We barely have a working vending machine. [scoffs] Okay. So what do you usually do? We send it to a lab. It usually takes at least five days. Sometimes weeks. Okay. Ryan, can you please do this for me? You realize this could get me fired? What happened to the bad-ass maverick that I used to hang out with? What do I get? The satisfaction of a job well done? Nah. I want a date. At a serious restaurant that has a wine list and table cloth. -You ask for a lot. -Well, those are my terms. Fine, I'm not wearing a dress. Fine. I'm not wearing ripped jeans, either. Fine. Yeah. [Moira] Hey. -Is everything okay? -[Jake sighs] Yeah, just, uh... Just had a stressful day at work. How about you? I'm just trying to reach Sherrie. Uh, Sherrie? Yeah, she's one of my stylists. -You met her. -Right. Yeah. I remember. She just left for lunch, and she never came back. Maybe she's mad at me because I was trying to cut some of her shifts. What happened to your shirt? Ah, you know, it's-it's pretty embarrassing. Really? Tell me. [sighs] I was, uh, challenged to play a game of pick-up basketball at work and popped a couple of buttons. Oh. In your suit. That was part of the challenge. [chuckles] And you couldn't say no. [sighs] You know me. Sometimes I am just, uh, stupidly competitive. God! What happened to your face? Oh, um, y-you know, one of the guys, um, scratched me on rebound. It's no big deal. All right. Well, let me get you a wet towel or something-- You know what, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm fine. Oh, yeah. Well, let me look at it then. Hey, would you, would you just, uh, just, just leave it. [scoffs] Please? Okay. You kind of remind me of Kristen. You know, she used to always come home with these scrapes and bruises, you know, a total tomboy. [laughing] You sure talk about Kristen a lot. Of course. She's my daughter. You're a good mom. I hope she appreciates you. Let's get you out of these... -Uh, don't! -Oh! -Okay. -I'm sorry, okay? I'm just... I just need, a, a few minutes. It's all right. I get it. Sometimes I come home and I, uh, just wanna sit in the bath for a couple of hours. -Yeah. -I'll just be in the kitchen. Okay. [sighs] That bitch. [dramatic music] Thank you so much for letting me stay here. No problem. -[glass shatters] -[car alarm beeping] -That's my car. -That's odd. No, it's super-sensitive. It goes off a lot. Sounds like my last boyfriend. -I'll be back. -[dogs barking] [car alarm blaring] [car honking] [dramatic music] [car honking] [car alarm blaring] What the hell? Oh, hell no! [grunts] [grunting] [car alarm blaring] [car beeps] [clattering] [both grunting] -[gasps] Oh, my God. -Call the police! [panting] -Are you okay? -Yeah. That was him. [dings] [phone vibrating] [message alert] [Moira] Jake? [exhales] Yeah, baby. It's just me. Take your time. [send alert] [message alert] -Hey. -[sighs] It's gonna be okay, all right? Look. Ooh, that's harsh. Yeah. She's delusional. Do you want me to check on her? No. She just doesn't wanna listen. Look, is there any way that you can just arrest him? -Are you sure it was him? -In my gut, yes. Kristen, I need more than that. This can't be a coincidence. Look, if I bring him in, I wanna make sure I have him dead to rights. All right? I can't let him walk. Where are you going? To file a report. You wanna come? Do you need me to? No, but you shouldn't be alone. She won't be. Can you clock me out? I'll leave you in good hands then. [clicks tongue] She's Team Ryan, if you haven't noticed. Aren't you? My eyes have been so glued. I really am sorry, Kris. Shut the door. [mellow music] [door closes] [sighs] [sighs] [Jake] Hm. You know, I'm just glad that today is over. Yeah. I know I could sleep for a really long time. Mm, me, too. You want a sleeping pill? No, I'm okay. -You sure? -Mm-hmm. Come on. I just wanna feel you melt into my arms. [Moira] Mm. Maybe just half of one. [dramatic music] [Ryan] Yeah, yeah, yeah. What can you tell me? He changed it legally? What did his name use to be? No, no, that's really helpful. Thanks. -What about Jake? -Let me do my job, Kris. He changed his name? Are we just gonna ignore what happened last night? No. It was wonderful. It was. We're good together. Yes, we are. So is this his real name? Ah, stop. Okay? Look, I'm going straight to work, and the first thing I do when I get there is I'm putting this name through the system. -All right? -No, let's google him right now. No, Kri... No. All right? We're not some crime-fighting duo here. Hey, I'm the one who told you about Jake. You owe me this. Seriously, are you trying to get me fired? I'm trying to protect my mom. [shower running] [dramatic music] [Kristen] Ryan? [Ryan] Yeah? Look, this proves everything I've been saying. What? When he was a teenager, he was on trial for murder. He was accused of killing his neighbor. His brother's girlfriend. That's why he changed his name. He wants to run from all this. Okay. Can I rinse off now? -Is that all you have to say? -All right, all right. Just give me a second. We'll talk it all through, all right? -I'm calling my mom. -Just relax, okay? Don't do anything stupid! [sighs] [phone chimes] [sighs] Mom, I-I've been texting you all night. -Why are you avoiding me? -I'm not avoiding you. I just took a sleeping pill, and my phone was charging. -[stammers] Are you alone? -Yeah. Where's Jake? -He's still sleeping. -Okay. Well, I've sent you some articles and I need you to read them right now. Okay. -Why? -Jake isn't even his real name. Well, he changed his name. So? He was on trial for murder when he was a teenager. [Kristen] Ask him why he never talks about that. -Murder? -He was acquitted. [Moira] Are you sure it's the same person? Yes, it's him. Everything he told you is a lie. I doubt he even has a job here. Well, that doesn't sound like the guy I know. Because you don't actually know him, Mom. He's playing you. He broke in to MJ's apartment last night. What? What are you talking about? I was here. He, he had a mask over his face, but I know it was him. Uh, okay, you don't make any sense. He was with me last night. -All night? -Yeah. I mean, I don't know. He went for a run at some point. Of course, he did. Listen to me, Mom, this man is dangerous and you should not be alone with him. Okay. You know what? I can handle him. -I'm coming over. -No, please, don't do that. [Moira] I'll call you later. [scoffs] What are you doing? Going to my mom's. Did she ask you to? -No. -Okay. Well, then, don't go. Don't you get it? This is a tinderbox and right now you're a lit match. What is that supposed to mean? He's never harmed your mother. -Right? -No. From what you've told me, you're the one he hates. So why do you keep poking him with a stick? Because I just can't do nothing. Yes, you can. Okay? Take a deep breath. All right? -Relax. -[sighs] I'll drive a patrol car over there and I'll check on her. Okay? Everything's gonna be fine. I'm not gonna let anything happen. Okay. Who were you, uh, talking to? Oh, it was, it was Kristen. Yeah? What did, uh, what did she have to say? Oh, she's just checking up on me. Hey, come back to bed, okay? Mm, I don't really want to. [Jake] Aah. I mean, you can see what she's doing, right? She's just, she's just trying to stir stuff up. That's what she does. She's miserable. And she doesn't want you and I to be happy. -Don't do that. -Do what? [Moira] Don't disrespect my daughter, ever. Do you understand? I'm sorry. She's my everything. Okay, I'm just... [sighs] I'm just sick of her trying to poison you against me. Did you change your name? [scoffs] Here we go. -Did you? -Yeah. Yeah, I did, okay? There are some things that I, I wanted to leave in my past. -A murder trial? -[scoffs] Oh, come on. You know me. Okay? I'm not, I'm not capable of doing something like that. The entire thing was just... a nightmare. -Okay. Well, tell me. -You know what? I really don't like to talk about it, okay? -Jake? -[sighs] Come on. This is important. Fine. It was the Fourth of July. Our neighbors were throwing their annual party. Sarah... Look, she was walking alone in the dark, okay? Somebody followed her and, and strangled her. The entire thing was terrible. So why did they think it was you? [stammers] I kissed her that night, okay? That's it. And then they blew the entire thing out of proportion. I mean, the whole, whole entire town turned on me. Do you have any idea what that's like, to have people whispering about you all the time? Even my parents. Even they started to believe that I did it. In fact, to this day, my mother thinks that I killed that girl. I thought you said your parents were dead. Because I wish that they were. I keep trying to put my past behind me, but, no. It keeps coming back over and over and over again. And nobody seems to care that I was acquitted by a jury. [scoffs] So what are you thinkin'? I just need a little time by myself. Okay? He totally did it. Wow. And you've been so objective up to this point. -[Ryan] How'd he get off? -Good lawyers. They blamed everybody but Jake. His brother, the sex offender who lived down the street... They gave the jury a reasonable doubt. -Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? -I'm calling my mom. No. We're gonna catch this guy, okay? Hey, I promise. Right now you need to be patient. [dramatic music] -[Jake] Reading anything good? -[gasps] [chuckles] I'm sorry, I just... I had to search and read it for myself. I get it. You were gonna do it sooner or later. [Jake sighs] Is it true? Did you kill that girl? [refrigerator door slams] I told you already. No. [Moira] Well, it's because a lot of the articles, the evidence implicates that you did. [sighs] It was eight years ago. I already went through a trial. Thank you very much. Jake, this isn't something I can just sweep under the rug. And I'm not asking you to! I'm just asking you to believe me. This is just... This isn't something I can handle right now. Wait. No, no, no. Come here, come here. Come here. Are you, uh... breaking up with me? Well, it's not like this is... a real relationship. Yeah. Right. You were just using me for sex. Screw you! You need to get out of here. Okay. Fine. You know what? This whole situation was starting to feel a little bit old anyways. [message alert] [send alert] Look. [door opens] [sighs] Who are you texting, Ms. Moira? It's none of your business. -No, get away from me! -Give it to me! -[Jake] Give it. -You don't have to do this. Yeah, I do because you don't [cocks gun] listen. [chuckles] So this is what you think of me, huh? That I'm like some kind of psycho? You weren't supposed to read those. Obviously, Moira. Stand up. No. Okay. -Come here. Get up! -[groans] Ow! No! God, you're hurting me! [chuckles] I thought you liked it rough, baby. -[chuckles] -God, you're... Oh, just get out of here. I can't do that. You know why? Because your daughter, she stole from me. -She stole from us. -[message alert] Oh. Let's see who this is. Oh, look. Poor little Kristen wants her mommy. Okay, you could do anything you want to me. But, see, don't you even realize that she started all the problems? You and I were just fine until she came along! You're crazy. You know, I really, I really don't like that word. Here, I think you're gonna need this. I don't really wanna hurt you, just stand still. Stand... Oh, there it is. I guess I'll speak for you now. [groans] Aah, let's see. "He's gone. I'm fine." No, wait, now what would you... What would you say? Hurray? No. Um, what? Good riddance? I got it. "Now I can get on with my life." Ooh. Sounds just like you, doesn't it? -[send alert] -Sent. You know what? Mm... Mm, one more thing. [send alert] [message alert] [mellow music] I'm gonna head out. You okay? -I think so. -Call me if you need anything. -Okay. -All right. Bye. Are you sure she's okay? Yeah. I'm gonna head over there. Thank you. -For what? -For being here. Anytime. [dramatic music] You know, did it ever occur to you that, uh... you're too old for me? -[grunts] -[muffled screaming] [music continues] Mom? [dramatic music] Mom? Mom? Mom? Where are you? [door opens] [Jake sighs] Hey, sis. Where is my mother? Mom! Mommy is just fine, all right? I wouldn't worry about her. What did you do to her? Okay, if you would please just stop yelling... And now, did you come alone? [whimpering] Yes. Are you sure? Where's, uh, Deputy Dog? I don't know. [music continues] Come on, baby, give me a signal. You do realize that you're the one who ruined everything? I, I told you not to intervene. But, no. What did you do? You went and you stole from me. This is Deputy Jessup requesting backup. Moira Atherton's house. Ludlow Road. [music continues] Where's my sneaker? I don't have it. [whimpers] Do not play games with me. [creaking] [Kristen] I can go get it for you. [door opens] No! No! Ryan! -[groans] -Ryan! [groans] Run, Kristen! Mom? Mom, where are you? [Ryan groaning] [Ryan groaning] Hey, buddy. You doing all right? [Ryan breathing heavily] Do you want me to call, uh, an ambulance or something? Psycho! [breathing heavily] You better not hurt them. Or what? [Ryan groaning] You're not gonna get away with this. What are you gonna do about it? [breathing heavily] The police are on their way. [Ryan groaning] Well, then, I guess I've got nothing to lose. [breathing heavily] Mom, where are you? [panting] [dramatic music] Oh, Kristen? I just wanna talk. [clattering] [panting] [music continues] [Jake laughs] [Jake] Kristen... Now you're starting to make me mad. -Ah! -Uh... -Come here, you... -Uh... [laughs] [muffled] Kristen! You're pathetic! [grunts] [muffled] Kristen! You thought you would take me down. But guess what? You lose, bitch. [groaning] [breathing heavily] Get the hell off her! [grunting] [grunting] Mom. Mom! -Mom, stop! Mom, stop! -[siren wailing] Mom, stop! Stop! Stop it! The police are here! [siren wailing] [birds chirping] [mellow music] Are you sure you're gonna be okay? Of course. 'Cause I don't have to go. [laughs] Of course, you do. Come on, this is a great opportunity for you. UCLA is the perfect place. I'm just gonna miss you, that's all. -Come here. -[sniffles] So, ahem, you just call me as soon as you get there, all right? -Yes, I will. -Okay. Probably, before I get there. At the first rest stop. You're not worried about Jake? Oh, what? No. Because he's in prison and they are not gonna let him out. I have a bunch of other tenants coming to look at the place later on today. -So I won't be alone. -Okay. Well, please be sure you are thorough with the application. I promise, I will. -I love you. -I love you. [music continues] Okay. -Bye, Moira. -Bye, Ryan. Take care of our girl, okay? I will. Don't worry. -Bye. -[Moira] Bye. You ready? Uh, I just don't like leaving her alone. Hey, she's not gonna be alone, okay? She's gonna have a new tenant in no time. As soon as we get you settled in, the first thing I'm gonna do is come back here and check on her, okay? -Okay. -All right. Okay. LA, here we come. -Let's go. -[car engine cranking] [engine revving]
