Man: Since the dawn of cinema we've been making movies about hell and the devil. And they've been just films, so they've been safe. Antrum is not safe. Narrator: In 1988 a small movie theatre in Budapest, Hungary burnt to the ground. Bystanders that had witnessed the event described it as if the building had spontaneously erupted into a monument of fire. Killing the 56 people who were watching the film. The film that was screening was called "Antrum". AJ Bond: It was released in one theatre and it burnt down. It's kind of the holy grail of underground cult films that no-one has seen, except for a handful of film festival programmers who are now dead. And the rumor is that the film is cursed and anyone who watches it will die. Nathan Fleet: You know of Nakata's "Ringu", Verbinski's "The Ring", Carpenter's TV movie "Cigarette Burns", all about movies that kill people. But Antrum is that movie. Nathan Fleet: From what I've heard, because I haven't seen it, a young boy, a young girl in a forest, digging a hole to hell. Narrator: In 1983 the film was submitted to film festivals across the United States. It is known that it was submitted to at least 7 festivals, from which it was rejected and never received a public screening. AJ Bond: It was like the work of the devil. It's like the devil started submitting a film to film festivals. Narrator: Several of the festival programmers had suffered a fatal or near fatal incident shortly after watching the film. This list includes Janet Hilberg of the Jones Park Festival who died of a seizure 24 hours after screening Antrum. She was said to be discussing her rejection of the film with a colleague, moments before collapsing in a local coffee shop. Asen Gadjalov: And is that possible for an art form to change the physical being of a human? This is since day one, since Greek times when we had theaters and hospitals next to each other, and people go to hospitals watching shows to actually heal. So is that possible for an art to have the opposite effect? Absolutely yes. Narrator: Tom Stylum of the Colorado Film Festival suffered a fatal electrocution the following morning in his kitchen. Robert Kayle: No, I am not one of those people that are "I'm afraid because its spooky", And maybe some people died between this time and that time. But it hasn't anything to do with the film. Nathan Fleet: I believe that something could mess you up, forever. Narrator: And most bizarrely Joe Barringer of the La Jolla Film Festival while at the beach had fallen on a stonefish and incurred a venomous sting close to his abdomen. Among the most venomous fish alive, they are very seldom found on the coastal shore of the United States. Joe's accident occurred in the afternoon mere hours after his screening. AJ Bond: Seeing even the small portion that I did, It's not a super scary, like you don't jump out of your seat with scares. It just... gets under your skin. Narrator: The final deadly event that transpired before the films mysterious disappearance occurred in San Francisco in November of 1993. The film's growing notoriety as 'the movie that kills' enticed a local movie theatre to screen the film. The audience was well aware of the film's alleged curse, before they entered their seats. Shortly after Antrum began the mood in the audience turned from playful amusement to a palpable anxiety. This growing anxiety amongst the crowd escalated into a stampede towards the theatre exits. Which had all unexpectedly been locked. This had created an all-out panic where a large number of people started rioting and viciously fighting one another. Resulting in over 30 injuries and the trampling and death of a pregnant woman. Narrator: Later toxicity tests revealed that the majority of the audience had ingested lysergic acid diethylamide. Or LSD. Yet every patron insisted they did not take the drug. Upon further investigation, Richard Samy, an employee confessed to slipping large portions of the drug into popcorn butter that night. Every present for that screening of Antrum has declined an interview for this film. AJ Bond: And as a result it's been lost for years. Some people don't think it exists, some people claim to have seen it and lived, and now apparently... You guys have found it. Narrator: The producers of this film have successfully tracked down a sole copy of Antrum at an estate auction in Connecticut. The print revealed itself to be typical of a film shot in the late 1970s on 35mm stock, with the exception of notable peculiarities found both in the film's sound and picture. Analysis suggests that these peculiarities are deliberate and designed to provoke both a physical and psychological effect in the viewer. There are reasons to suggest that since this print has been in circulation, some unknown third parties have manipulated it as there are multiple occurrence of what appears to be un-related and graphic footage spliced into the film. Since the producers of this film are unsure about the origins of this material. They feel the audience should be specifically warned about its illicit nature. For the first time publicly screened in over 20 years we present to you Antrum, The Deadliest Film Ever Made. Nathan: Mom? Where is she? Nathan: Mom? Nathan: Mom? Maxine, is she in heaven now?

C'mon... Nathan: Where are we going? Oralee: First, do you remember the verse? Nathan: Yes, ' In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence in your midst. And you sinned. So I cast you out as a profane thing from the Mountain of God. And I destroyed you o guardian cherub from the midst of the stones of fire.' Oralee: Good. This is the forest where the devil landed when he was cast out of heaven. And at the very spot, we'll find the entrance to hell. The Antrum. Oralee: Come. Let's see. Go all the way up And all the way back down. Nathan: Here? Oralee: Yeah. Oralee: Ready? Oralee: With this prayer, nothing bad shall come of us. Oralee: One by one we pray to thee.

Nathan: Ike said that? Are you sure? Oralee: Cross my heart. Nathan: And hope to die? Oralee: And hope to die. Nathan: We're in the first layer. Oralee: Yeah? Wow. Nathan: I don't hear anything. Oralee: What are we supposed to hear? Nathan: Trumpets. Oralee: Nate? Oralee: Nathan? Oralee: Nathan, it's a demon! Come here, come here, come here. Be very still. You see that?

Oralee: Nathan you need to brush your teeth. Nathan: I won't brush my teeth until you wash your feet. Oralee: Oh. Nathan: What? Oralee: Oh no! Nathan: What?! Oralee: Cerberus. Nathan: What is Cerberus? Oralee: Shhh. Oralee: The gates of the underworld are guarded by the ferocious Cerberus. A 3 headed dog with razored teeth and piercing eyes who can tear up not just your body, but also your soul. He is charged with keeping devilish beings from leaving hell And most importantly, keeps living mortals out. Nathan: Will Cerberus come after us for coming here? Oralee: Cerberus is chained to the gates of hell, which are in the 5th layer. So we're safe. Besides, he'd have to smell us coming, so as long as we don't smell foul. Nathan: I'm going to go brush my teeth. Oralee: Okay. Nathan: You should wash your feet. Oralee: Everything okay? Nathan: Yeah. Nathan: One by one we pray to thee, Protect us from all we'll see.

I don't know how you got it into your head that Maxine went to hell, but your nightmares... I thought, If I could make you believe that we saved her soul, maybe they'd stop. Cerberus, he isn't real. Because I made him up. Nathan: But, Ike's Book says... Oralee: No, I made Ike's Book. I drew all those pictures, I made the stories. Ike didn't give it to me. Because he isn't real. Nathan: But... Nathan: I met him. Nathan: Behind Erin's Diner, just like you said. Oralee: You must have dreamt it Nate. Nathan: He showed me things. Oralee: What did he show you?

Oralee: One by one we pray to thee, Protect us from all we'll see. From all we'll hear and touch and smell, From all the unknown dark in hell. Narrator: The Producers have commissioned an investigation into the physical print of the film, to see if there is any scientific basis for the strange phenomena surrounding Antrum. The film contains distinct peculiarities speculated to provoke a physical and psychological effect in the viewer. The first was the presence of binaural beats. Auditory illusions that stimulate specific frequencies within the brain. Brock Fricker: Well binaural beats, a lot of people over the years have studied sub-sonic frequencies. What you hear is maybe 500 cycles. But if one's at 500 cycles, the frequency on the left side And the frequency on the right side is maybe 504 cycles, your brain would pick up on 4 cycles. And 4 cycles could induce some kind of a state. They can make you enter into a state of euphoria like a high. Others can cause you to feel very anxious. And supposedly certain frequencies, if they're loud enough, can even cause you to have nervous breakdown. Narrator: A more puzzling peculiarity was that over the original print there was an invisible layer of some type of thin plastic, Cut and fitted precisely over frames. Tabitha Zhu: Those are sigils. So sigils and symbols are said to hold an emotional power over people. You don't have to be consciously aware of these associations to be influenced by it. These associations, they are deeply embedded in the collective unconscious of human culture. For example, something as simple and commonplace as a triangle carries with it powers with special associations. For example, in the western world the triangle is associated with trinity - the father, the son and holy ghost. In the Eastern cultures the triangle means manifestation and illumination. And for the occult, the triangle is a summoning symbol. Interviewer: A summoning symbol? Tabitha Zhu: Exactly, a summoning symbol. Interviewer: To summon...? Tabitha Zhu: To summon, The devil or whomever... Dr. Ivan Gaston: You know I'm familiar with the particular sigil of symbol that is used in Antrum. Basically it's an evocation to call upon one of 72 demons. In this case the particular sigil that's in the film belongs to the demon Astaroth. It's from a grimoire, a spell book. It acts as an invitation to whoever is exposed to the sigil. Basically its saying 'do you want to play?' Dr. Ivan Gaston: In the village of Laon in France back in the mid 17th century. A group of magicians believed that the children of the village were more in league with The Devil than with God. So, they decided to evoke Astaroth. Now nothing was heard from the village for about 2 weeks. They found every man, woman and child in church, sitting in church, with their mouths open as if beatifically singing. Only thing was that they were all dead, they had been murdered. Now in the main square, they found the magicians walking in a circle, holding onto their eyes. They had gouged out their own eyes. That is the power of Astaroth. Tabitha Zhu: I don't think a sigil or a symbol or in this case a movie can physically harm someone. But it is widely known that beliefs can strongly influence people. For example, the Kurdaitcha, who is a ritual executioner of an aboriginal tribe in Australia. All he has to do is point a bone at a victim and the person quickly becomes apathetic, unresponsive and death occurs within days of being "cursed" so to speak. But it is a psycho-somatic response to what the medical community refers to as a self-willed death. Asen Gadjalov: I believe in the power of the fear. And the way the fear works with people. I do believe that people can make themselves believe so much in things, that they can turn those things into truth and that imagined truth, or this imagined feeling, which could be fear, Can end their life.
