(dramatic music) (plane engine roaring) (plane engine sputtering) - What's the matter? - I'm gonna set her down at the first place that looks inhabitable. - What's wrong, Doug? - I don't know. It sounds like we're runnin' out of gas. It might be a cracked cylinder. - What's the matter? - No gas. Hold on, we're gonna try for a landing. - Don't land here. Try to find a place where there's some civilization. - We haven't much choice. - But you can't land in a place like this. We'll crack up. - Leave him alone, George. - We'll crash, I tell you, we'll crash. - Brace yourself, here we go. (plane engine rumbling) (wind whooshing) (plane rattling) (suspenseful music) - Watch your step, Tess. - Thanks! - Take it easy, George. - Where are we? - Well, unless I missed my guess, we're near Iraq, about 100 miles from the Transjordan Border. - Stuck out in the middle of nowhere, eh? - Thank heavens we're only stuck. If it hadn't been for Doug, we might've been killed. - I was pretty lucky. I'm glad you weren't hurt, Tess. - I'm glad none of us were hurt. - That's not what he said. Don't be blind to his chivalry. - Well, that goes for you, too, George. - Thanks. - [Doug] Try and get Cairo on the radio, and give 'em our position. I'll check the engine. (pleasant music) - George Torrence, calling Cairo. George Torrence, calling Cairo. Come in, Cairo, come in. - Just as I thought, the fuel line's broken in half, and there's a cracked cylinder head, too. - Oh Doug, what are we going to do? - Don't worry, Tess. I've been in much tougher spots than this, but I always manage to get back to my base. I'll get you back. - Can you hear me, Cairo? This is George Torrence, calling Cairo. - Tell me, Doug, why did you quit the Flying Tigers? - Why'd you ask me that? - Oh, I just wondered. - Well, most of my buddies were assigned to different units, and, well, when you work and fight together for a long time, you sort of hate to split up. A lot of 'em were sent to Egypt, and I'd hoped to join 'em today in Alexandria, but it looks like we're grounded for the duration. - Well, in that case, I'd better forget about getting to Lisbon in time for the clipper. - I think you'll make it. George has probably contacted Cairo by now. They can get a plane out here in a few hours. Don't worry, Tess. - Hello, Cairo, come in, Cairo. Come in, Cairo. What's the matter, can't you hear me? - You gettin' anything? - Not a squeak. These radio tubes are cold. Are there any spares? - No. - Totally unprepared, not even spare radio tubes. - What are we to do now? - Stay here and rot, I suppose. - Now, wait a minute, I remember a group of buildings about 10 miles back. One of 'em looked like a castle. - A castle, here? - Probably a mirage. - No, it looked like one big building with a lot of little buildings all around it. - Maybe a settlement of some kind. - Maybe, it's certainly worth looking into. - Now, please, Everett, stop kidding yourself, and stop kidding us. You know perfectly well there couldn't be a castle in this godforsaken wilderness. All we can hope for is to sit here and wait for a slow and nasty death. In the meantime, I'm gonna get pie-eyed. - Now, listen, we're gonna start movin', and you're gonna help us. Hand me that parachute, will you, Tess? - [Tess] Here. - Of course, it would simplify matters if you and Tess wandered off and left me here, trying to get Cairo. - You got a pair of scissors in your handbag, Tess? - Mm-hmm. - Will you get them for me, please? - [Tess] Uh-huh. (gentle music) - George, must you be so rude to Doug? - Oh, he gets on my nerves, always hanging around you like a lovesick puppy. - You've no right to say that. - Haven't I? Well, at least he might wait until we're divorced. (gentle music) What are you doing? - I'll need about a dozen strips, as long as we can get 'em, and about 18 inches wide. Here, give me a hand. - If it's not a military secret, do you mind my asking you what you intend doing with these strips? - I'm gonna lay out a code design. The Air Force has a series of designs for the ground forces to communicate with the flyers. If one of our planes pass over, they'll see the message and send help. Give me the scissors, Tess. - If one of our planes passes over? I don't suppose there's been a plane over here for months. I might lay out a signal for a couple of cases of scotch for me. - Well, I guess that oughta do it. - What does it mean? - Sending help, 10 miles to south. - I hope you're right about that castle. I'd like to see some human beings, any human beings. - Well, the natives to the northwest are definitely pro-Axis. This part of the desert's full of devil worshipers. - What are they? - Friend of mine in the Tigers told me about 'em. They're tough Arab tribes that live in the foothills and come out only to rob and kill. They mistrust all Europeans. They can be pretty nasty customers, so you better keep your eyes open. Wait here, I'll get my gun. - Anyway, they'd have something to eat and drink so I wouldn't die of thirst. - Here's your hat. We've got a long, hard hike, so let's get goin'. (plucky music) - Look over there. - [Tess] You were right. It does look like a castle. - It's probably a whole settlement. Let's hope the natives are friendly. Let's go. (dramatic music) (man speaking in foreign language) (man speaking in foreign language) (man speaking in foreign language) Weird-looking ducks, aren't they? Let's ask that fellow where we are. I wonder what sort of language they use. - Why don't you try French? - All the French I know is a few phrases I picked up in the last war. You know, (speaks in foreign language). (George speaking in foreign language) (man speaking in foreign language) What's he (speaks in foreign language) about? (man speaking in foreign language) Sheik, sheik. - He's muttering something about a sheik. - Sheik. - I gather he's on his way. - Only, only thing we can do is to await developments. (man speaking in foreign language) Hey, what are you doing? (man speaks in foreign language) If you lay your hands on me again, I'll punch you right in the beard. - Take it easy. This is some sort of a sacred building. You're probably sitting on one of their gods. Fella seems to be a priest. See, he's begging the gods' pardon. - If I knew his language, he'd be begging my pardon. - Be careful, George. - Devil worshipers. - Devil worshipers? - See the figure of the serpent carved in the wall? It's supposed to be the image of Satan. They regard the devil as the agent of the Supreme God and worship him as the creator of evil. - Come on, let's get out of here. (suspenseful music) (people chanting) Well, what's this, A Mayday parade? (people chanting) - That's the high priest. You see the bronze peacock he has on his staff? Devil worshipers believe that the peacock admitted the devil to the garden of Eden. As a punishment, he was given a rasping voice, but allowed to keep his feathers. (people chanting) - Look at those native girls. They seem to be in a trance. - They've been hypnotized. - Oh? - [Doug] Hypnotism is part of their religion. They've developed it to perfection no white man's ever been able to approach. - [Tess] How long will they stay that way? - For years, maybe. - What? - Or until their parents have made certain sacrifices to the church. Then the high priest will bring 'em out of it. (people chanting) (drums banging) (dramatic music) (man speaking in foreign language) - I am Sheik Ahmid Bel Nor. Welcome to the kingdom of Ghatsi. Well, that's what our friend was Ghatsi-ing about. I'm afraid we haven't heard of Ghatsi before. - It would give me the greatest pleasure to acquaint you with it. - You speak excellent English, your highness. - And French and German. And occasionally a little Italian. Since many nations covet my country's oil, I thought it wise to be prepared. At present, the English have control. - Then we are in Iraq? - [Ahmid] Yes. - I apologize for landing uninvited in your territory. - Uninvited, but I assure you, not unwelcome. - I'm George Torrence, allow me to introduce my wife. - Delighted, madame. - And this is Douglas Everett. - I'm honored. Your uniform, sir. Its identity escapes me. - Flying Tigers. - Oh, yes. The Flying Tigers. I've heard of their exploits, as dramatic as they are daring. - Those, I suppose, are your bodyguards. - [Ahmid] A few of my household troops, sir. A relic of barbarism, I know. I can quite understand the contempt with which you are at this moment regarding them. - But I'm not. The Tigers weren't much to look at either. They're well-armed. - Sheer preparedness. I cling to the passions of my fathers, but I also like to move with the times. But about yourselves, I presume it's some misadventure. A most fortunate misadventure for me, that has carried you so far into the wastelands of Iraq. - We were flying to Alexandria when our plane ran out of gas. - Perhaps you could provide us with transportation to take us back to civ, I mean, the nearest big city. - To civilization, you were about to say? Why hesitate, my dear sir? We know very well that we are barbarians. We are quite reconciled to the fact. We've had some 5,000 years to accustom ourselves to it. This sword is a barbarous weapon compared with your revolver. But madam is standing all this time. Devins. - Your highness. - What are you thinking of? Horses for our guests. - Your highness. - I trust you'll accept the hospitality of my poor house. - And transportation will be forthcoming later? - Time enough to talk of that, Monsieur Torrence, when you've rested and recuperated from your adventure. You will do me the honor of dining with me this evening? I hope you may find us not altogether uncivilized. - I'm afraid your highness will have to excuse our clothes. - I think perhaps we can take care of that. Devins. - Your highness. - You are in the confidence of our mistress of the robes. How does our wardrobe stand? - Well, shipments from Europe have been kinda slow on account of the war, but in spite of that, up to date, your highness, up to date. - Good, then I hope, madam, you may find among them some rag that you will deign to wear. - I'd never hope to find modern gowns in the middle of the desert. - I sometimes have the pleasure of entertaining European ladies in my solitudes, and I find there is nothing like a new gown to mitigate the terrors of exile for them. As for civilization, you know, I always have at my elbow one of its most finished products, Devins. You will recognize in Devins a representative of the ruling race. I assure you, he rules me with an iron hand. Not always in a velvet glove, eh Devins? - Your highness will have his little joke. - Now Devins, the horses. We've kept our guests waiting much too long. - Your highness. - Madam. - Thank you. (pleasant music) - Your horse, madam. You were speaking of transportation, Mr. Torrence? Is your plane beyond repair? - Completely, I'm afraid. - Most unfortunate. However, I'll have your baggage sent for. - Thanks. - Your mounts, gentlemen. (dramatic music) (hooves clopping) My home, madam, gentlemen. 300 years old, but quite modern despite that. - I'd always imagined a sheik would live in a tent. - I believe that my ancestors, several times removed, realized even then that a tent in a desert could prove a little drafty. (dramatic music) (hooves clopping) (gentle music) - Well, if you think I'm impressed, your highness, you're quite right. - Thank you. Oh, Devins. Timah will prepare madam's bath. You will see that the gentlemen are sufficiently refreshed. - [Devins] Yes, sir. - My home is yours. I trust you'll be comfortable. Until later, then. (gentle music) - Madam? The servants are waiting through the archway, the last entrance to the left. - Thank you. - [Devins] Gentlemen, this way, please. - How about those refreshments? - Very good, sir. (Tess knocking) (pleasant music) - Oh. Oh, I've read about rooms like this in "The Arabian Nights." - [Timah] Bath. - Oh, it's so beautiful. What an exquisite perfume. Take a lot of ladies a long time to use all these. - Yes, many ladies. Many wives. - Oh, his highness has quite a family? Now, Timah, what about those Paris frocks? Dress. - Dresses? Will bring many. - Oh, that's wonderful. Then I'll have a choice. (Timah claps) Oh, oh I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disorganize the rituals of the bath. I feel so helpless. - Oh, here you are. - Oh, hello. - Nothing like a cold shower to buck you up. I feel like a new man. Quite a place he's got here, eh? Palace and fortress all in one. - Yeah, must've been tough to knock over before the days of the airplane. That's a pretty good flying field he's got down there, too. And I Wouldn't be a bit surprised if he had a couple of Messerschmitts hidden away someplace. - What, down there? Well, that's his parade ground for reviewing his troops. - Yeah. What's going on down there? (suspenseful music) Looks like they're getting together for a meeting or something. - Must be evening prayers. - Uh-uh, it's too late for evening prayers. Must be something special. I don't like the looks of it. - What's the matter with you, Everett? You're always so suspicious about everything. - Hey look, the sooner we get outta here, the better. Those fanatics are after our hides, I feel it. - Nonsense, come on, have a drink. - Where's Tess? - I don't know. I have no idea where they marched her off to. - Well, we better find her, and don't let her out of your sight. - Oh, don't get excited, Everett. Our host seems a perfect gentleman. - You don't seem to be very worried about Tess. - I couldn't follow her into the women's quarters, now could I? Besides, what business is it of yours? - It's any man's business to be concerned for the safety of a woman, I- - Oh, stop behaving like a Boy Scout. - His highness will be down presently, sir. Your pleasure, sir? - A large scotch and soda. - Yes sir, and you sir? - Hey, look Devins, where's Mrs. Torrence? - Mrs. Torrence is completing her bath, sir. - Well, it's taking her a long time. - I'll make your mind easy, sir. The lady ain't gonna meet any undesirable characters. I gave strict orders to the female what's in charge. - Can you trust her? - Absolutely, sir. She happens to be my wife, sir. - Mrs. Devins, huh? - Yes, sir. A little brandy, sir? - Look, Devins, can you tell us exactly where we are? - They call this place Ghatsi, sir. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that, but where is Ghatsi? - They tell me this is the Syrian Desert, but it's near Iraq, east of the Euphrates River, sir. - We don't need a lesson in geography, my good man. What Mr. Everett wants to know is how far are we from civilization? - Well, I really don't know, sir. Not so very far, I daresay, as the crow flies, sir. - Unfortunately, we're unable to fly with the crow. How long does the journey take? - To where, sir? - [Doug] How far is Baghdad? - Well, as the crow flies, sir, they tell me about three weeks. - As the crow flies, they tell ya. You remember how long it took you, don't ya? - No, sir. I've never been to Baghdad, sir. Now if you'll excuse me. - That guy's a liar. You notice how he hedged? - As though he's had orders not to tell us anything. Oh, don't be ridiculous, Everett. I wish you would settle down. You make me nervous. - Just the same, I don't like him. (pleasant music) - Dress. - Only one? Well, that's not much choice. - His highness picked dress. - Oh, he did? Quite a complete service. Well, Timah, I'm afraid I'm not the type. - He say lady look awfully good in dress. - Well, that's very kind of him, but I'm afraid you'd better bring me something more conservative. - Conservative? - Your sheik knows a lot about women, doesn't he, Timah? (Timah laughs) (lively orchestral music) I feel a little chilly. - There is an edge to the air when the sun begins to set. You'll find this room quite pleasant. To tell you the truth, I use it only on state occasions, like the present. Let me find you a comfortable seat. Monsieur Torrence, Monsieur Everett. I trust my mistress of the robes furnished you with all you required? - Everything, thank you. - I'm glad. I had hoped that perhaps your choice might have fallen on something more, but no, I was wrong. Madam's taste is irreproachable. Now, are you all quite comfortable? - Quite. - Perfectly, thanks. - [George] Never felt better, your highness. - Then we go into committee upon your position here. - [George] Fine. - I'm afraid you may find it rather disagreeable. - Transportation bad, eh? Difficult journey in store for us? - A long journey, I fear, but not exactly difficult. As I said earlier, the British Army is presently in control of Iraq. - That shouldn't be an obstacle. - Perhaps not. It seems you have dropped from the skies at a most opportune moment. For me, that is. You see, a very special event took place in Mosul only a few hours ago. A trial, presided over by the most august officers of the British Army. - Court-martial? - Precisely. Three of my subjects, accused of spying, have been sentenced to death. - Did your highness know these men? - Oh yes, they are my brothers. - You mean, they are some of your tribesmen? - Not at all, they are sons of my father. Not of my mother. - Oh, I'm sorry we had to intrude upon you at such a time. - Oh please, don't apologize. Believe me, your arrival has given me the greatest satisfaction. - Evidently your brothers were working for the Nazis. - For what they believe is right, sir. My brothers are fanatics. But there is no fanaticism in me. - How do you happen to be so different from your brothers? - I was my father's oldest son. I was educated in the best schools of Europe. I shed all my prejudices, and became an open-minded citizen of the world. My brothers, on the other hand, turned to their native culture. The religion of my people has always been a primitive idolatry and superstition. They work themselves up to a high pitch of frenzy, against the exploitation of Iraq. - You knew this spy business was dangerous. Why didn't you stop 'em? - I suppose I might've imprisoned them, or had them strangled, the traditional method of ending disagreements in our family. But why should I? Some of their arguments were quite excellent. - In other words, you're working for the Nazis. - Not entirely. But we have been offered an unusually attractive treaty by Herr Hitler. An agreement which might justify giving our full support to the Nazi movement. - Don't you know yet that Hitler's treaties aren't worth the paper they're written on? - I won't argue the point. The fact is, his offer, at the moment, is the most attractive. - Then the quicker we get out of here, the better I like it. How soon can we get transportation? - That is just where the difficulty arises. - What are you getting at? - Materially, it might be managed, but morally, I fear it is, excuse the colloquialism, madam, no go. - [Doug] You mean you won't help us? - Would your highness be good enough to explain? - Well, since the news has spread that you three have dropped from the skies, precisely at the moment when three princes of the royal house are threatened with death, my subjects have got into their heads that you've been personally conducted here by the Evil One, whom they worship under the sign of the brass peacock. In my eyes, of course, your arrival is the merest of coincidences. A charming coincidence. But my people hold primitive views. - Then the upshot of this is that we're going to be held as hostages to be exchanged for your brothers. - [Doug] A typical Nazi trick. - That is not quite the idea, my dear sir. The fact is, my priests do not hold that an exchange is what the Evil One decrees. Nor, to be quite frank, will it altogether suit my book. - Not to get your brothers back again? - You may have noted in history, madam, that family affection is seldom the strong point of princes. My sons are quite young, and were I to die, we're all mortal, there might be trouble about the succession. In our family, uncles seldom love nephews, nor kings their brothers. - So you'd let your brothers die. - That is not my only reason. Suppose it were possible that I could bully the British government into giving them up. Do you think it would sit down quietly under that humiliation? No, no, no, dear lady. Assuredly, we should have a face-saving expedition. It would cost thousands of lives, and millions of money. It wouldn't suit me at all. - Surely you don't mean- - Though I have absolute power over my subjects, if I defy their prejudices, evil though they may be, they would upset my throne tomorrow. (man singing in foreign language) - What's that? - Come, let me show you. (man singing in foreign language) (drums banging) (people chanting) It's the chant of vengeance, a promise to the Evil One of an appeasement offering from the sacrificial altar. You see, my people's religion has not yet emerged from the mosaic stage of development. - Let's cut the fancy talk and get to the point. - The point? The point is they demand an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. A life for a life. - You mean to say- - Unfortunately, I do. - You will kill us. - Not I, madam, my people. - And if your brothers are shot, as they certainly will be, we're going to be killed in cold blood? - Oh, not in cold blood, monsieur. There is nothing cold-blooded about the emotions of the worshipers when white goats, as their phrase goes, ought to be sacrificed to the serpent. - You'd let 'em kill a woman? - Well, as to that point, they might not be too exacting. If madam will be so gracious as to favor me with her society. I gather that you do not so please. Well, I scarcely hoped you would. I won't press the point, but the suggestion remains open. - That's enough. Do we get outta here peacefully, or do we have to shoot our way out? - Oh no, Monsieur Everett, I've had your teeth drawn. (gun clicks) That precaution was taken while you were at your bath. Besides, that wouldn't help a bit. You'd only be torn to pieces instead of... - Your highness. - Forgive me. This is interesting. If you'll excuse me for a few minutes, I think I may have some news for you. - To think that we were saved this morning, only for this. - There must be some way out. - It's worse than a prison. This appearance of freedom, his manner of politeness and hospitality, it's unbearable. Like a cat playing with a mouse. - Cat? More like a tiger. - What can we do, what can we do? Doug, George, you must think of something. - We might try and bribe Devins. - Offer him every penny we have in the world. - I'm afraid his price for his services will be a pretty stiff one, if they're for sale. - But at least we can try. - I wouldn't trust him. Let's see, it's about 10 o'clock London time. Let's see if we can get the BBC news. (static crackles) (music blares) - [Announcer] And the convoy continued on its way without further incident, according to the admiralty's official communique. There is still no news of the plane overdue at Cairo. Airport officials believe Everett's plane was either attacked by enemy pilots operating from secret arid realms in Iraq, or was forced down by mechanical trouble somewhere in the vast stretches of the Syrian Desert. - No news of sending out a plane to look for us. - [Announcer] Meanwhile, from British Headquarters at Mosul comes news that the three Arab spies are awaiting tomorrow morning's firing squad with fanatical calm. These spies are believed to be- (electronic beeping) - What's that? - It's a wireless. Someone's sending a message, and the transmitter must be in this house. - I can't make it out. - What are they saying, George? - I don't know, it's in code. - It's probably in communication with his agents in Mosul. - If I could only get my hands on that wireless set for five minutes, I'd make his highness laugh out of the wrong side of his beard. - Where do you suppose is it? - Well, the billiard room's in there. - That's the main room. It's probably upstairs. - It stopped. - It'll be back soon. Don't let on we know anything. - Now listen, the sheik fell for you hook, line, and sinker the moment he set eyes on you. So you've got to try and keep him out of this room, while Doug and I get to work on Devins. We may be able to send a message out. - But suppose Devins won't help us. - Don't bother your head about that. Leave him to us. - Uh-oh, here he comes now. - I told you I might have some news for you. It has come. - What news? - The execution of my brothers is fixed for tomorrow. - Then, tomorrow- - Yes. At sunrise. Meanwhile, I hope you'll regard my poor house as your own. I shall advise you not to attempt to pass the palace gates, for my brothers are very popular, and my people most vindictive. Besides, there are 300 miles of almost impassible country between you and the nearest British post. - And how'd you happen to hear this news? - Does that puzzle you, you don't guess? - I thought it might be a short wave radio, or a wireless. - You observed nothing to confirm that idea. - No. - I may tell you, then, that your guess was correct. I am in communication with distant cities by wireless. - Then you have a wireless expert here? - Devins, again. That invaluable fellow. He is my operator. - [Doug] And with whom do you communicate? - Do you think that quite a fair question, Mr. Everett? Does it show your usual tact? I have my agents, I can say no more. And now, madam, shall I ring for Timah to see you to your room? - If you please. No, just a minute. Won't you please bring about an exchange, your brothers' lives for ours? - I'm sorry, madam, but that is impossible. No whisper of your presence here must ever reach the British Army, or, again, excuse the vulgarism, my goose is cooked. - What you really mean is that you're afraid to defy these, these devil worshipers. You haven't the courage. - You abuse the privilege of your sex in order to taunt me with cowardice. Besides, you can't read my mind. I may be only playing a little joke on you. I hope you've observed that I have a sense of humor. - It's a pity your intentions don't match your charm, your highness. Goodnight, George. - Goodnight. - Doug. - Night. - Goodnight, madam. - Goodnight. - Your highness, the high priest is waiting. - Oh, show him in. - Your highness. - Gentlemen, I want you to have the pleasure of meeting our high priest. He is, in a manner of speaking, my archbishop. - Your highness, the high priest. - This is the high priest of the Serpent God. (priest speaks foreign language) (Ahmid speaks foreign language) His Grace reminds me of some arrangements for tomorrow's ceremony. Allow me to introduce you. (Ahmid speaks foreign language) Monsieur Torrence, Monsieur Everett. His Grace. (priest speaks foreign language) (Ahmid speaks foreign language) - What's bothering him now? - He asked about the lady. I told him her fate has not yet been decreed. Please, excuse his manners. He regards you, I regret to say, as unclean creatures. Perhaps it'd be best if I bid him farewell. (Ahmid speaks foreign language) (priest speaks foreign language) His Grace says au revoir, until tomorrow. (priest speaks foreign language) - What'd he say? - He says that "Tomorrow, our brothers will be avenged." You don't know how my faithful subjects are looking forward to tomorrow's ceremony. - I can't stand this cat and mouse business any longer. - Why, you dirty smooth-tongue. - Dignity, my dear fellow, dignity. There's no reason why we shouldn't behave like civilized beings. How would you like to pass the time? I'm sorry I can't offer you any shooty. What do you say to a game of billiards? No? Then, goodnight. If there's anything you want, just ring for Devins. Goodnight. (ominous music) (eerie music) - Timah. - Yes, madam. - That dress his highness selected for me. - Dress? - I'm going to put it on. Well bring it, the dress. - Oh, his highness dress. Yes, madam. (ominous music) (tender music) - Devins. Devins. - Your highness. - I think it would be wise to keep a close watch on our friends. The man who's flown with the Flying Tigers is likely to take chances. - Very good, your highness. If they tries to corrupt me, sir, with money, sir, shall I let on and take the bait? - Bribe you? In that case, you may do as you please. I have the most implicit confidence in you, Devins. - Thank you, sir. - I know that anything they might offer you would have to be paid in English currency, and you dare not show your face among the English. You have a very comfortable position here. - I'm most grateful, your highness. - And you don't want to give the hangman a job. - No, sir. - So I rely entirely on your discretion. - Your highness. (ominous music) (Ahmid knocking) (suspenseful music) - Come in. (ominous music) - Of all the fair ladies who've graced this room, you are the most exquisite. Is it too much for me to hope that you are wearing this gown at my suggestion? - I'm wearing it for my husband. I wanted our last night together to be as perfect as possible. If you'll excuse me. - Spare me a few moments. I want to speak with you seriously. - I'm afraid we have nothing to talk about. - I feel for you, madam, I do indeed. I would do anything. - Anything, but help us. - Why should I have the will to save Monsieur Torrence? He is your husband. That doesn't recommend him to me. And from my observations, I venture to guess doesn't greatly recommend him to you. Now Monsieur Everett, on the other hand, is the heroic type. Yet, if I may add without indiscretion, the interest you show in him, a most friendly interest, I'm sure, doesn't recommend him to me, either. After all, you could hardly expect me to show favor to a man who holds the attention of the woman with whom I've become infatuated. (ominous music) As you see, my people have taken full precautions. However, they will find no objections as long as you're in my escort. (pleasant music) - Pardon me, chaps. - Oh, Devins. - Yes, sir? - I take it you can guess what we have on our minds. - I ain't no hand at guessing, sir. I'd rather you put it plain. - You know what's in store for us in the morning. - I've heard a few things, sir. - You're not going to stand by and see three of your own people murdered? - Me own people? What is me own people ever done for me? The first thing what England ever done was to put me in the reformatory for pinching a silver rattle off a young aristocrat in a perambulator. - You can't blame England because you're a thief, Devins. - Me old lady would've bashed me blinkin' face in if I'd ever come home empty-handed. - Might've saved somebody else the trouble. - Now look here, you ain't no one to be passing any insulting remarks. - He doesn't mean it, Devins. We only thought you might be willing to help, but I guess we were wrong. - Yes, I guess you was, sir. If you took me for a VC hero, what had laid down me life for England home and beauty. - I get your point, Devins. But the question now is, how much do you want for getting us out of here? - To get you out? Why, if you was to offer me millions, how could I do that? - By sending this message to Cairo. - Ah, so that's your game, eh? Do you know what you're risking? If his highness ever suspected that you was getting word through to Cairo, why 10 to one he'd wipe you off the slate, just like that, without waiting for tomorrow. - But why should he suspect? - Well, how much have you gents got to offer? - Well, we don't have much cash with us. - We can give you the balance in IOUs. - How do I know you'll pay 'em? - There are people in the world who keep their word, you know? - Even to a rat like you, Devins. - I'd advise you to keep a civil tongue in your head, Mr. Everett. Don't forget I have you in the hollow of me hand. - And the hollow of your hand is a very nasty place to be in. That's why we're willing to pay to get out of it. - Come on, come on, what'll it be? - Well. How about a little first installment in cash? Be it ever so humble. Never mind the chicken feet, is this all you got? - It's all we have with us. - How about the lady? - She has a little jewelry. - I'll take it. Every little helps, you know? Now how about the balance? - Would 1,000 apiece do? - 1,000 apiece? 3,000 pounds? Why you're joking, Mr. Torrence. What good would 3,000 pounds be to me in England? Why, I'd have to start the valeting again. No, no. If you wants me to do this job, I've gotta have enough money to make a gentleman out of me. - I'm afraid it would take more than that to make a gentleman out of you, Devins. - Well, if you ain't the queerest lot of, your lives is hanging by a hair, and you're passing insulting remarks. - All right, we'll double the bid. 2,000 apiece. - Nah, you'll have to make it more, sir. Double it again. I'll tell you what I'll do. If you signs an IOU for 15,000 pounds, which I has here already made out, I'll see what can be done. - [Doug] Well, if you aren't the most. - Well, if your lives ain't worth 5,000 pounds apiece, nothing doing. Look at the risk I'm taking. I ain't charging you for that, you know? - We appreciate your generosity, Devins. - Now if you'll sign, sir. - Not so fast. You'll get it after you've sent the message. - Where's the wireless room? - It's upstairs, sir. - Let's go, we'll watch you send it. - Oh no, sir. That's impossible. I couldn't take a chance of being seen with you, not for millions. This has to be done secret-like. - Now wait a minute, how do we know you'll send the message? - My word as a gentleman, sir. You'll have to trust me. Otherwise, the whole thing is off. - As one gentleman to another, Devins, you don't mind being paid after you've done the job? - I'm very sorry, sir, but I do. - Do you know the code letters for Cairo? - Yes sir, I know 'em. - All right, you've got the message, now get busy. We'll be waiting when you come back. - Right you are, sir. Oh, don't forget the jewelry. (somber music) - You don't know how my faithful subjects are looking forward to tomorrow's ceremony. - Seems to me you're taking advantage of the war to even up a few personal hates. The war will be over someday, and you will regret this murder. - Very unfair, madam. Why hold me responsible for your predicament? - Who else is responsible? - Chance, fate, gods, providence, whoever or whatever pulls the strings. Did I force your plane to crash? Once you set foot here, it was utterly beyond my power to save you. If I raised a finger to thwart the determination of my people, it would be the end of my rule, perhaps of my life. No no, madam, I cannot risk it. - You cannot risk it? You dare not, you're a coward. - Forgive me if I smile at your tactics. You want to goad me into chivalry. You are a brave woman. You have the courage to die, why not have the courage to live? Not as the wife of a dissipated husband, but as the absolute queen of an absolute king? - Please. - I don't speak to you of romantic love. I respect you too much to think you are accessible to silly sentiment. But you would be my first and only queen. Your son, if you gave me one, would be the prince of princes. All my other sons would bow down to him, and serve him. From the blending of a flower of the East with a flower of the West, will be born the man of the future. The man who will possess the strength, the wisdom, the courage to rule the destiny of the world. I beg of you to answer. - Wonderful words, your highness. The devil must have put them in your mouth. (tender music) (electronic beeping) - He's sending. - Those aren't the call letters for Cairo. - He's double-crossed us- - Shh. He's not sending any message at all, and now we are stuck here. - Wait a minute. If those tubes will fit the radio in the plane. (suspenseful music) We have to hide it. - Yeah, they'll fit all right. - Now if we can get outta here. - Yeah, but how about Devins? He'll be back for his jewelry. - Here he comes now. (suspenseful music) - I've done it, sir. I sent the message. - Are you sure it got through? - Yes sir, straight through to Cairo as clear as a bell. Now how about paying me off? - We'll pay ya off. (intense music) (somber music) (man shouts in foreign language) (gong crashes) - Well, we'd better get out of here. - We've gotta find Tess. (intense music) (man speaks in foreign language) (suspenseful music) - I'll hit 'em high, you hit 'em low. Hey! (intense music) - You ready? - Yeah. (eerie music) (man speaks in foreign language) (Ahmid speaks in foreign language) - Don't you touch me. Take your hands off me, let me go! Doug, George, George! - That's Tess. - It came from the other side of the wall. - [Tess] George, George! Take your hands off me, let me go! Doug, George! (intense music) (Ahmid speaks in foreign language) - Which way is the plane? - I think we came from that direction. - No we didn't, it was over there. - We came from the west. There's the North Star. That way. (suspenseful music) - They won't get very far at night. (Ahmid speaks foreign language) (man speaks foreign language) (dramatic music) (eerie music) - How much further is it? - I don't know, but we've gotta keep moving. It shouldn't be far. Can you make it, Tess? - I'm all right. (ominous music) (hooves clopping) (pleasant music) - Tess, the plane! (dramatic music) We made it! (ominous music) (hooves clopping) (Ahmid speaks foreign language) Better make this radio work quick. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) George Torrence calling Cairo. George Torrence calling Cairo. Can you hear me, Cairo, come in, Cairo. Come in, Cairo. - Did you get 'em? - Only a buzz. A faint buzz. Wait a minute. No, it's nothing. Can't you hear me, Cairo? Come in, Cairo, come in, Cairo. (guns firing) (intense music) - You keep on trying. I'll try to hold 'em off. (intense music) Get back out of sight, Tess. (guns firing) - Escaped from sheik's palace. Awaiting help 10 miles west of Ghatsi. Please hurry. Can you hear me, Cairo? (intense music) (guns firing) - There's too many of 'em. We might as well give up. There's no use getting you shot. (dramatic music) (hooves clopping) - So, most inconvenient and foolish on your part, my gallant friend. Where's Monsieur Torrence? - He's in the cabin. - Hasan, Ali. Did you get your message through? Answer me, did you get your message through? - No. (suspenseful music) - Most noble, but unfortunate sacrifice. Monsieur Torrence has laid down his life in vain. - George! - We'll adhere to our program without further delay. Hasan. (dramatic music) (hooves clopping) (man singing in foreign language) (crowd clamoring) (gong crashes) (gong crashes) (people chanting in foreign language) (priest speaks foreign language) (Ahmid speaks foreign language) Well, Monsieur Everett, you've come to the last lap. It had to be run sometime, you know? - And this is it, eh? - This is where the final rites begin. Don't be alarmed about Madam Torrence. She'll be here in due time. - If you wanna save your neck, you'd better not go through with it. - I cannot deny my people the pleasure of a double vengeance. No, I have a long score against you swaggering lords of creation, and by all the gods I mean to see some of it paid. (crowd clamoring) (gong crashes) They are bringing Madam Torrence. (gong crashes) (people chanting in foreign language) (drums banging) (Ahmid speaks foreign language) I apologize, madam, for the manners of my people. Their fanaticism is beyond my control. - How much time have we left? - Until the great gong sounds. Then you will be led to the sacred enclosure outside, and oh, by the way, you need have no fear of the ceremony being protracted. It will be brief and, I trust, painless. My people are not incapable of cruelty, but I've resolutely set my face against it. Forgive me. (Ahmid claps) I am, for the moment, not a king, but a priest. I must observe a certain dignity. (priest speaks foreign language) (Ahmid speaks foreign language) Must I do violence to my feelings by including you in the approaching ceremony? There is still time. Immovable? So be it. (Ahmid speaks foreign language) - I'll kill you! (intense music) (men shouting in foreign language) - Chivalrous, but ill-advised, Monsieur Everett. You've laid impudent hands upon their chief. My colleagues insist upon subjecting you to a process of expiation. A most interesting, but painful ritual. It's too bad that you must suffer these indignities, Monsieur Everett, but after your sudden outburst, death alone will not appease the fury of my people. I myself have always been opposed to bloodshed, but this medieval punishment has been created by my priests to- (plane engines roaring) (crowd clamoring) (dramatic music) - Planes. - Merely reconnaissance, I think. (Ahmid speaks foreign language) We autocrats are very badly brought up. We're not accustomed to having our desires resisted. It's not too late, even now, to consider my offer of yesterday. (plane engines roaring) - This is it. We're going on in. Proceed with flight plan. (plane engines roaring) (crowd clamoring) - They're coming back. (men speaking foreign language) (man speaks foreign language) (Ahmid speaks foreign language) (Ahmid claps) (ominous music) - My guard informs me that one of the planes has landed. So Monsieur Torrence outwitted us. He lied like a gentleman. I didn't think he had it in him. - If you've done anything to Mr. Everett they'll- - Ah yes, Monsieur Everett. I'll have him brought back. (Ahmid speaks foreign language) (man speaks foreign language) (people chattering) (ominous music) - Well, what goes on? - You, come. - What are you waitin' for? (ominous music) Detail halt. - Douglas Everett's the name. Boy, am I glad to see you. This is Mrs. Torrence. - Captain Carson of the United States Army Air Forces. Where's the man who sent that message? - He was shot while transmitting it. - Oh yes, a most unfortunate affair. - Who are you? - I am Sheik Ahmid Bel Nor, emperor of Ghatsi, lord high commander of the Dasnits. - I'm Captain Carson of the United States Army Air Forces. I understand you're holding these people. I demand their immediate release. - Demand? Are you prepared to discuss terms? - It's the policy of the American government never to bargain with gangsters. Our terms are unconditional. - I'm afraid, Captain, I'm not impressed. - Is that so? Very well, Sergeant. - Captain Carson calling squadron commander. Captain Carson calling squadron commander. Proceed with attack, proceed with attack. (plane engines roaring) (explosion booms) (crowd clamoring) - I see, bombs. - Yeah, and they'll blow this place to bits in no time. - That was a warning. I'll give you just three minutes to release these people, otherwise we'll destroy your palace. - Are you suggesting that I should surrender, Captain, I didn't quite catch your name. - Captain Carson. - Ah yes, Captain Carson. Why on earth should I surrender? No doubt your comrades can destroy my palace. They can drop their thunderbolts directly on this temple, but if they do, not only I, but all of us here would be escorted to our last abode in fragments. I doubt whether that prospect will be alluring either to you, or Monsieur Everett, or madam. No, Captain Carson, I call your bluff. - The last bomb fell on the ravine. The next one will be closer. Proceed, Sergeant. - Captain Carson to squadron commander. Captain Carson to squadron commander. Proceed with attack, proceed with attack. (plane engines roaring) (explosions booming) (crowd screaming) (people shouting in foreign language) (Ahmid speaks foreign language) - My priests and my people have a superstitious dread of these eggs of the flying goddess. They fear injury to the sacred image. I bow to superior force. You may, if you wish, signal your commander. - Then you accept our demands unconditionally? - I'm afraid I must confess, Captain, that my game is up. I give in. This comes with falling behind the times. If I'd only had anti-aircraft guns. - You're mighty lucky you hadn't. But hold attack. - Captain Carson calling squadron commander. Captain Carson calling squadron commander. Withhold further attack, withhold further attack. Acknowledge. Command given and acknowledged, sir. - And now, if you'll assign us an escort through the crowd? - Certainly. (Ahmid speaks foreign language) - Mrs. Torrence, Mr. Everett. - Now it only remains for me to speed my parting guests. I hope we shall one day renew our acquaintance to talk over old times. Oh, not here. I plainly foresee that I shall have to join the other kings in exile. - Yeah, well if you ever get to Texas, be sure to look us up. We'd like nothing better than to return your hospitality, wouldn't we? - It would be a pleasure. - Thank you. - We'll be at home as soon as we wipe your friend Hitler off the map. - My ex-friend. Au revoir, madam. - As I said before, your highness, it's a pity your intentions don't match your charm. - Let's get outta here. (dramatic music) (plane engines roaring) - How you doin' back there? - Well, it's the first time I've ever flown as a passenger, but this backseat driving is okay. (triumphant music) (plane engines roaring) - She would probably have been a blasted nuisance anyway. (dramatic music)
