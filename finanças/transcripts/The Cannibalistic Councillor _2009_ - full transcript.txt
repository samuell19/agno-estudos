-And now take me to his father. See you later Conchita. I'll be back soon. Let's go. THE CANNIBALISTIC COUNCILLOR I'm sick of everything... of men, of diets, of collagen, of liposuction, of politics... sick of everything, apart from sex. I'm social affairs advisor... as much in my personal life as in my professional one. I believe that sex is a profoundly social matter and that sexual pleasure is something that everyone should have access to. without prejudice or limits. We should encourage the culture of promiscuity, of swapping partners and having many lovers. Desire should be acknowledged as the principal means to a better society. When you desire someone, you don't usually want to harm them. It means you're compassionate towards them. Unless you're rejected, of course. I think this is a very interesting, yet unexplored issue. Especially from female, political and right-wing perspectives. I'll take a year off to write a book that addresses this issue. A book where I can write any whim that comes to mind during the assemblies and the ceremonies at the prefecture. The openings of park and tunnels, mass at Madrid's Cathedral etc. at these times - as at all times - all I think about is sex. My only interest lies in checking out a man's behind, then his feet, and his package. So I use sunglasses and lie about having a phobia of light. But I can look at whatever I want. My problem started very early on my interest in men's parts began at aroung age 4. and I could just grab them by lifting my hand as if I was picking fruit. At the beginning I was very successful, and very popular with everyone. Until all the men in my family and among my friends (none of whom were gay) began to reject me when thay saw me coming. I learned to be an outsider at an early age. It's very hard. You start to despise yourself at as young as age three. I learned from hearing screams of "Don't touch that!" "Don't eat that!" God it was a hard age! I think Franco was a good ruler, but when it came to sex, he was clueless. I cherish everything about the male body. But I love the feet the most. Ah the feet! They drive me crazy. Once I was talking about it at a party. At that point everyone was half out of it. Well, my colleagues covered their faces And yet Calie, for example, loves to eat pig's feet. What's the difference between eating the feet of a pig and those of a man? When i said this, the Health Advisor told me that she prefers dick, and that she likes to hit herself across the face with a cock before sticking it in her mouth. I told her that this is exactly the problem with the PAP, conveying the image of a party that's out of touch and stuck in the past. I also like that sucking dick and all, but I want something more! People expect something more from us. We have to offer the citizens something more,some alternatives to help them grow and be happier. The really interesting thing about this -whish could even attract the (I'll dedicated a whole chapter of my book to this) it's that, for example, what I like most when I've got a cock in my mouth, oh i love a finger in my vagina... or better still, two fingers in the vagina, or, one i the vagina and the other in my ass. Specifically, when I'm nicely lubricated, just how I like it I'll suggest to the people that they try it at home, because there is nothing more democratic than pleasure. What I like is to go down on a guy and start to eat his feet and ankles. Well, one of my fantasies is to eat a man whole, starting with the feet. I tried and I managed to put a whole size 45 foot in my mouth. What do you think abouth that? I already have the title of my book! "A Pig in the PAP" Sounds like a bestseller, eh? You can accuse me of anything, apart from smugness. Before I go to bed, I do a little self-evaluation and then I can sleep peacefully. I haven't been sleeping well lately. Sometimes I think it might be the coke. But I won't have problems stopping. I have control. What do you think of Pina? I don't think she's beautiful enough to be a model. Pretty, yes, but look, waiting for a man day and night is like something from the nineteenth century. Look, when my husband left me, a few days ago when he closed the door I screamed really loud, so he could hear. "OK, let the next one in!" I went out into the street, and he was waiting for me, the next one. But I just felt disappointed. Silvio will tell you. Unless you want me to tell you? -Hi. -Hi. -Who are you? -Maribel, and you? -Chon. -Did you notice I was sleeping, Chon? -Like a log. ?I had a dream. -Oh yea? What dream? -I think it was an erotic dream. -How wonderful, what happened? -I don't remember it all, but I think it involved a man's toes. -Did you eat them? -Yes! -I started to eat them and ended up eating the whole man. Crazy huh? -I started to eat them and ended up eating the whole man. Crazy huh? -You're brilliant, despite appearances. prevod uredio ...
