[MUSIC - "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"] -Thank you very much. -Are you ready, sir? -My dear, have you decided what you'll have for dinner? -Yes, I have. I'll start off with escargot Marseilles with Chablis, 1964. Then cracked crab with mustard sauce, Manhattan clam chowder, Caesar salad for two, don't forget the anchovies, Chateau Briand, blood rare, with Escala potatoes a la Pierre, vegetables en garni, of course with that a bottle of Margot '57, asparagus tips, hollandaise sauce supreme, fettuccine Alfredo, a magnum of Piper Heidsieck champagne, five star, 1961-- --61. -And of course don't forget the caviar. For dessert, I want baked Alaska, cherries jubilee, chocolate mousse, strawberries teddy, and a demitasse of Irish coffee. -My dear, tell me, do you eat this well at home. -Well, no. But then again, at home, nobody wants to fuck me. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Good morning, Mr. Perkins. -Morning, Mr. Winton. Good morning, Mr. Sullivan. -Jerry, how are you? -Ah, Dr. Coswell. -Good morning. -That hat becomes you. -Oh, thank you. -It's a pleasure having you on the committee again. -The pleasure is mine, Jerome. -I'm sure I don't have to remind you of the importance of our being here. We must go over thoroughly each and every file submitted by our investigators. Then when we have cast our ballots, the world will soon know the winners of the World Sex Award. -Here, here. -And now if we're ready to begin-- we have 10 areas for our consideration. Preliminary approach, truth, consistency, emotion, appearance, timing, interplay-- as opposed to foreplay-- pace, commitment, and overall performance. Observe the following representative scenes very closely. The dignity of the World Sex Awards depend on your judgement. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Help! Oh, honey, come help me. I'm stuck. Oh, it's no use. I'm stuck. -Dummy, I told you not to use the bathroom. I just got through shellacking the toilet seat. -Oh, well, it's too late now. I'm stuck. Do something. -All right, I'm going to run upstairs, and I'm going to call the rescue squad. Now, they'll be here in a few minutes, and they'll get you out. -OK. -Now, don't panic. I'll be right back. -All right. -Operator, give me the rescue squad. And for god's sakes, hurry. [SIRENS] -Thank God you're here. -Don't worry about a thing, buddy. Everything's gonna be OK. Now, where's the wife? -She's right down here. Come on. Wait a minute. OK, the rescue guys are here. They'll get you off in a minute. Now, I'll go get them. -Wait, wait. Give me something to cover up with. -Something to-- here. OK, come on. Well? Come on, come on. -We can save your wife, mister, but the cowboy's a goner. -I just don't believe it. That Nurse Soames has got to be the most incompetent nurse I have ever seen. Just look at how she screwed up these reports. How in the hell did she ever get to be a nurse? -Simple. Her father is chief of staff of surgery at the hospital here. [SCREAMING] -Damn it, Nurse Soames. I told you to prick his boil. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Help! Help! Help! -Hey, hey, hey-- what's going on here? Hey lady, what the-- -Oh my god. Thank heavens you're here. I thought no one would ever come-- -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you're gonna be OK now, lady. You're gonna be OK. Tell me what happened. -Well, this morning, my husband came home from work early, and he caught me with my boyfriend. And he shot him. Then he beat me up, ripped off my clothes, and threw me out. Oh, and then this motorcycle gang came along. And one of them had a sidecar. And they forced me in it and dragged me way out here and tied me up like this. All 17 of them raped me and left me out here all alone to die. -Aw, gee, lady. This looks like it just ain't gonna your day. -Three, please. -Ball room, please. -Sorry. Didn't realize I was crowding you. -Dolores, now that we're married, I think it's time to get to know each other directly and without shame. Now, do you know what this is? -Well, that's a wee-wee. -No, no, my dear, sweet Dolores. That is not a wee-wee. From now on, we shall call this a prick. -Oh, come on, Arnold. I've seen lots of pricks, and that is definitely a wee-wee. -What the hell do you think you're doing? -I'm sleeping on the couch. -Are you kidding? This is our wedding night, and there are certain duties that a husband must perform. -Oh no, not me. My mother told me that you women have teeth down there. So I'm sleeping on the couch to avoid pain and injury. -Teeth? Why, that's the most ridiculous and asinine thing I've ever heard. Now, you listen to me. I've been waiting 27 years for this night, and I'm not going to let you spoil it. So you get in that bedroom right now. You've got work to do. -Oh no, I'm not. I know you've got teeth down there, and you're not going to convince me otherwise. So there. -OK, stupid. Take a look at that. Now, do you see any teeth down there? -Are you kidding? With gums like that? [COUGHING] -What is it, my son? Tell me. Here, my son. Write don't your last words to your beloved wife. Go ahead, write them for her. She's hurrying here now, but I'm afraid-- I'll make sure that she gets it. -Oh, no. Father, is he-- -Yes, my child. He's at peace now. But his last thoughts were of you. Here, my darling. -Oh! -Get your fucking foot off the oxygen hose? -And so, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that here in this sex clinic, ladies and gentlemen, you will learn the solution to your particular problem. Now, you should feel free to ask any question on any subject, whether it concerns impotence or penis envy complex or nymphomania or fellatio compulsion, or any of those good things. -(LISPING) Doctor, I really have a problem. For me, sex is just a pain in the ass. -And you, sir, do you talk to your wife while you're having sex? -Yes, if I happen to be near the phone. -Tomorrow's your birthday, my sweet, and I don't know what to get you. You've got everything, of course. -Well, surely there must be something. -By Jove, I think I've got it. I'll get you a monkey. -A monkey? What on earth am I going to do with a monkey? -Well, you don't own one, do you? -No, I don't. But where will the poor beast eat? -Why, in the dining room with us, of course. -What about its quarters? Where will the beast sleep? -Why, in the bed. It could sleep with us. -Really? In the same bed? Think of that terrible, obnoxious odor. The stench. The smell will be awful. --I got used to it. The monkey will get used to it. -Now, how can you tell her that your best man went and slammed your shlong in a door? And then-- well, then I had to go to a hospital, put the thing in a sling. Oh, it was-- no, how can I tell her? She's waited her whole life for this night. All right. Thanks. Thanks, doctor. Bye bye. -Darling? I'm ready. No man has ever touched these before. And no man has ever seen this jewel. It's all yours. -Well, that ain't nothing, honey. Look at this. It's still in the original crate. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Stop. Please, mister. Please, stop. -Yes, ma'am. Can I help you? -Yes. There's something you could do for me. -Now, wait a minute. Now, don't get excited with that thing. I'll give you all my money. -Don't want your money, sonny. -Well, what is it you do want? I'll do anything you say. Just don't shoot. -I want you to jack off. -Jack off? In the middle of Interstate 39? -Got it right, sport. Now, get going. -OK, lady. I hope you're satisfied. Can I get out of here now? -Nope, sonny. Beat it again. -Oh lady, have a heart. OK, you're the boss. -Whip it again, buster, or I'll blow your brains out. Sonny, that was a pretty good one. Now, let's whip it again. -Lady, I don't care if you shoot me. I don't care if you kill me. I couldn't raise another hard on no matter what you do. -That's just what I wanted to hear. You could come out now, Mary Lou. This nice man's gonna give you a ride to Fresno. -Thank you. -You know, I've noticed you in here before and I-- I really think you're beautiful. -Thank you. -You know, I've been noticing you quite a bit. I was just wondering if-- well, maybe you'd like to come home and meet my parents. -How dare you? You beast! -I guess a blowjob would be out of the question. -You know, my wife's acting weird again-- jumpy and twitchy, nervous all the time, a real mental case. -It sounds like she just needs a rest. Are you gonna send her to Palm Springs this year? -No. I think I'll just fuck her myself. -Oh. -Yes, brothers and sisters, I have sinned. I have lain in the arms of many men. I've drunk gin. I've smoked. Night after night, I've caroused and gambled on our youth and future happiness. Entire weekends I would spend at drunken orgies and wild parties. But I've changed. Look at me now! Converted! [CHEERING] -Now you see how I spend my weekends. I spend my weekends standing on this corner just beating this motherfucking drum! -All right, now let's great our next contestant on "The Amateur Hour." From Hannah, Missouri, Mr. Lionel Schlemmer. [APPLAUSE] -Welcome to the show, Lionel. -Thank you. Thank-- thank you very much, Mr. um-- -Tack. Mr. Tack. -Tack. -Just a little nervous, aren't you, Lionel? Well, tell me, Lionel, what do you plan to do with the prize money if you happen to win our talent contest tonight? -Well, I plan to use it to have a hernia operation. HOST (OFFSCREEN): A hernia operation? All right now, Lionel, you just take your place, OK, and we'll be with you in just a moment, OK? Now, ladies and gentlemen, stepping into "The Amateur Hour" spotlight, from Hannah, Missouri, Mr. Lionel Schlemmer singing and dancing to "Dixie." [PIANO PLAYING] -(GROANING) I wish I was-- oh god-- oh-- -Boy, 25 years in prison. That's a long time. I'll bet you it was rough on you. -Yeah. It taught me a lesson. Believe me, I'm never going back to that hellhole again. -I don't blame you. -Hey, what the hell's your problem, man? I mean, since I walked in this place, you've been eyeballing me. Like, what's your problem? -I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare at you like that. You see, I just got out of prison. I did 25 years for raping a buffalo. I thought for a minute there you might be my son. -You know, being married to Harry is really rough on a girl. If his penis was a half an inch longer, I couldn't stand it. -Me neither. -Hey, Patrick. I haven't seen you in a long time. -Yeah. Let me have a beer will, will you? -Hey listen, uh, how's the wife? -Oh, you didn't hear? She died last week. Gonorrhea. Strangled to death. -Gee, that's too bad. Hey, wait a minute, people don't strangle to death when they have gonorrhea. -Oh, they do when they give it to me. -Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Hilton Bank, your "WWA" emcee. I'd like to welcome you this afternoon to "Wide World of Athletics." This afternoon, we have the privilege of interviewing the lovely wife of all-star pro golfer Mike Birdie. How are you today, Mrs. Birdie? -I'm fin, Hilton. It's-- it's a great and sacred pleasure to be on your show. -Well, thank you, Mrs. Birdie. Let me ask you a question. Before a big tournament, is there some special thing that you do for your husband? -Oh, I usually rub his balls. -How, uh-- how, uh-- does this seem to help? -Oh, it straightens out his putts. -You see, we talked about various techniques, but today I should like to take a survey, on how many different positions you folks know for sexual intercourse. -Two. -Two, yes. -Seven. -76. -76? We get all the nuts in here. -11. -11? -Three. -Doctor, I only know just one. DOCTOR (OFFSCREEN): And which one is that, my dear? -Oh, that's, um-- that's when the man gets on top of the woman and he sticks his thing in. -77! -Let me see, three children and you've been married 6 and 1/2 years, is that correct? -That's right, doctor. -Do you ever use Vaseline for sexual purposes? -Oh, very often. Doesn't everyone? -Very good. And, uh, where do you apply it? -On the bedroom doorknob, of course. -Bedroom doorknob? Why there? -It keeps the kids from coming into the room while we're screwing. [LAUGHTER] -And you, sir, do you cheat on your wife? -Who else? -Doctor, my husband thinks I'm frigid just because I detest sex. Isn't that ridiculous? -See what I mean? This broad's driving me nuts. -What do you mean I'm driving you nuts? Why, you're the most despicable bastard-- -Please, let's not have any arguments. We're only here to help. -Sorry, doc. -All right, now let's get on with this. How many children do you have? -We have three children. -All by rape. -Why don't you go fuck yourself? -78! [COCKTAIL PIANO] -Kid, you're sensational. Baby, Lou Lassfinger, talent agent. That's the greatest melody I've ever heard. -Thank you. It's an original. I write all my own tunes. -You write all your own stuff? Just what I'm looking for. With songs like that, I can get you booked at the Palace. Who's your publisher? -I don't have any. -Publishers want nothing to do with me. -You're putting me on, kid. You're talking to Lou baby now, huh? Your songs are great. You could sell millions. Why won't the publishers talk to you? -I don't know. They say it's my titles. -Titles? Well, what's the name of the song you're playing now? -Well, this happens to be one of my favorites. It's called, "I Love You So Fucking Much, I Could Shit." -Peaches, pears, peaches, pears, peaches, pears. -Hey, peddler. Have you got a minute? Come on, I want to talk to you. I'd like to buy some peaches. -Oh, surely, dear. I got plenty, nice, fresh peaches. -But tell me, are they nice and big, like these? -Yes. -And are they nice and round, like these? And are they nice and firm, like these? [SOBBING] -What's wrong? -Lady, I'll tell you what's wrong. Today my house burned down. I lost all my money at the racetrack. My wife ran away with my best friend. My car was repossessed. And now I'm going to get fucked out of my peaches. -Wow. -What a shame. -Serves him right. -People, a little less noise and more work. -Sorry, Jerry. JERRY (OFFSCREEN): This is one of our local sporting houses that has been having some financial difficulties lately. -And don't come back till your mother gives you some Money, degenerate. Oh. (SINGING) Bills, bills, bills! [PIANO ARPEGGIO] -I haven't seen a ceiling since last winter. -It's been so long I can't remember when. -If business doesn't pick up very shortly-- -I'm afraid we'll all be virgins once again. -Oh, God forbid! -Now, it's time we must examine all our methods. Now it's time we must adapt to something new. In order to get back our former patrons, it's obvious there's one thing we must do. -We've got to get back on our backs. We've got to get out of the red. -Instead of enjoyment-- -We face unemployment. -We've got to get back into bed. We've got to get back on our backs. And get those men on the street. -On Carte Blanche or Diner's-- -We don't need cosigners. -We've got to get back in the sheets. We've got to get back on our backs. Our beauty is starting to wilt. -We can be passionate. -If there's any cash in it. -We've got to get back in the quilt. -My creditors are tired of all my begging. My girls are ready for the auction block. The Welfare office turns me down each Wednesday. Heh. Last week, I put my diaphragm in hock. -We've got to get back on our backs and get all that business we lack. -We're sad and forlorn-y. -Guys, we're so horny. -We gotta get back in the sack. We've got to get back on our backs and strike while the iron is hot. -Come on, you big kippers. -Unzip those zippers. -We gotta get back in the cot. We've got to get back on our backs. We're not here to strengthen our minds. -If you're looking for virginity-- -You're in the wrong vicinity. -We've got to get on our behinds. -So in order to solve all our problems, a franchise that we knew would be just right, we started our own take-out service, and we called it, yes, Quickie Delight. -Quickie Delight, Quickie Delight, all the kids are looking for sex tonight. Give us a ring. We promise to bring all the love you want, and your libido will swing. [RINGING] -Good evening, Quickie Delight. Yes, sir. Two blondes and a re-head, coming right up. [RINGING] -Good evening, Quickie Delight. No, sir. It doesn't matter how far away you live, it'll be hot when it gets there. [RINGING] -Good evening, Quickie Delight. Yes, sir. Oh, is that to go? Or will you eat it here? -Now, no more credit are we going to extend. Pay later has come to an end. All you chicks, if they want their kicks, money has to be our only friend. We're gonna get lots of new johns and turn them all on and make ourselves bread. In God we trust, all others pay cash. Let's get back in that bed. -And there's no waiting. -Get back in that bed. -Nothing but feeling. -You know you belong in bed! -Well, things are looking up for those lovely young ladies. -Oh, but with this inflation, I don't know how they'll make ends meet. -Virtue's its own reward. -Virtue? [CHUCKLING] -Malcolm, look at this next one. It's up your alley. -Up yours. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Gee, you're a little dry tonight. -Well, move up a little, schmuck. You're eating the sheet. -You know, this wife-swapping business wasn't such a bad idea. -I only hope our wives are hitting it off this well. -Welcome to that famous TV show, the show that loves to give away money, "TV Jackpot!" [APPLAUSE] -Thank you, thank you. All right, now, let's meet our next contestant, from Wedlock, Oklahoma, Miss Marion Cleavage. [APPLAUSE] -Welcome. Welcome to the show, Marion. -Thank you, thank you. -You don't mind if I call you Marion? -Oh no, not at all. -Cleavage sounds so formal, don't you think? -Yeah. Yeah. -Now, that's a very interesting town you've come from. Tell me, were you born in Wedlock? -Oh no, I was born outside of wedlock. -Ah! Oh, that's very good, Marion. Now, you know how to play the game, don't you? -Oh, yes. -All right, well, then let's play TV Jackpot. OK, for $50, Marion, who was the first man? -Um-- Adam? -Right, for $50! All right! OK, now you have $50. Do you want to keep that, or do you want to try and double up? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] -I'll go! -She wants to go, ladies and gentlemen. She wants to double up. All right. All right Marion, for $100, who was the first woman? -Um, Eve? -Right, for $100! All right, Marion. You're doing very good, very good. OK, now, you have $100. Do you want to quit, or do you want to double up? CROWD (OFFSCREEN): Go, Marion. Go! -Remember, if you answer incorrectly, you lose everything you have so far. -Mm, I'll go! -She wants to go, ladies and gentlemen. She wants to double up. Congratulations. That's lovely, Marion. [GIGGLING] -OK, now for $200, listen carefully, what were Eve's first words to Adam? -Oh, gosh. That's a hard one. -Right, for $200! -Will the lady for just boarded the bus, please step forward? Will the lady who's reading the Bible with the flowers on her hat and the white blouse, please step forward? You forgot to pay your fare. -Lady, pardon me, but I think he's talking to you. -Fuck him. -Is it drafty in here? -Uh-uh. Why? -I think I'm getting a chest cold. -Jordan, would you like a cigarette? -No, sir. No, sir. -Well, give me a light, then. -Yes, sir. Sir. -Thank you, Jordan. That's fine. I'll just light it myself. You know, Jordan, I made my way up on my own. My old daddy never gave me nothing. But I fought my way for everything, and I made my way to the top. -Yes, sir. You did. -It's going to be different with my daughter, Jordan. You know, she's my darling, my angel, my apple of my eye. She's going to have the finest, and I mean the finest, including college. -College? What-- what college you gonna send her to, boss? -Why, good old Georgia Tech, that's what college, boy. -Georgia Tech? You must be kidding. -Huh? -No one goes there but football players and whores. -Well, Jordan, I'll have you know that my dear wife went to Georgia Tech. -Oh, really? What position did she play? -Hey bartender, this guy's playing with himself. -Oh, just ignore him. -I can't. He's using my hand. -Oh, man. Did I tie one on last night. I went to a wild party, and I go so smashed I left my wallet in the bathroom. -Do you think you're gonna go back and look for it? -Well, I'd like to, but I was so drunk, I can't remember where the house was. -Oh, come on, you've got some important IDs in there and some credit cards. You're got to remember something. Think. Well, let's see, it was a house in the neighborhood. It had a green door with two bullhorns on it. And there were red drapes in the living room. Oh yeah, in the bedroom was the wildest thing you ever saw-- a gold, metal toilet. -Well, look, that's not going to be too hard to find-- a green door with bullhorns and a gold, metal toilet. Come on, hurry up and get dressed and I'll help you find it. -What the hell do you want? -Come on, go ahead. Ask her. -Uh, did you have a party here last night? -Yeah, we did. What's it to you? -Do you have a red drape in your living room? -Yeah, we do. So what? -This might be a strange question to ask, but do you have a gold metal toilet? -Hey Harry, I just found the idiot that crapped in your tuba. [GAVEL] -First case, Anabel Carson, accused of prostitution. -Your honor, this is a disgrace. Why, my mother would turn over in her grave if she could see her poor, innocent baby being accused of prostitution. -Young lady, you have seven prior convictions of prostitution, and that's just in the last three months. 30 days. Bailiff, take her away. [GROANING] -Next case, Darlene Dorsey, accused of prostitution. -What kind of a world are we living in anyway? Can't a girl ask a sailor for a cigarette without the police thinking she's a hooker? Well, I've never been so embarrassed or humiliated in all my life. -Miss Dorsey, you've had 15 convictions in the last two months. -Oh, but your honor, It's a mistake. I'm-- I'm the victim of-- [GAVEL] -60 days. Bailiff, take her away. [GROANING] [GAVEL] -Next case, Marjorie Pittance, accused of prostitution. -Your honor, I am a whore. I know it's a lousy thing to say, but it's the only way I know to make a living. Do with me as you want. My life is worthless. I have no reason to go on living. -My dear, in the 20 years I've sat on this bench, you're the first honest woman to come before me. And your honesty shall not go unrewarded. Case dismissed. Uh, bailiff, have a check made out for $500 from the policeman's welfare fund, and give it to this young lady. Miss Pittance, we hope that this money can start you on a new life. -Next case, Morris Goldberg, accused of selling fruit without a license. [VIOLINS] -Your honor, what's the use of trying to lie to a learned man like yourself? I, too, am a whore. -Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is Hilton Banks, your "WWA" announcer. This afternoon, we are interviewing former ace Air Force pilot during the Second World War with the RAF, Mr. Sven Svenson. Now tell me, Mr. Svenson, during your experiences in the Second World War with the RAF, what was the most frightening experience that you had? -Well-- well, I was flying over Germany, all by myself. Then all of a sudden, to my right, there was this German fucker. And then to my left was another German fucker. And then I was completely surrounded by all these German fuckers. -Um, let me explain to our viewing audience that the German Fokker, spelled F-O-K-K-E-R, was a German plane flown during the Second World War by the Luftwaffe. Now, isn't that correct, Mr. Svenson? -Ja. Ja, but these fuckers were Messerschmidts. -Uh, let's go back to our main studio now. -OK, Mac. What'll it be? -(LISPING) Oh, dear me. I'd like a glass of milk. Well, how sweet. Thank you very much. My, that was delicious. Could I trouble you for another glass of fresh dairy? Say listen, there aren't many people in here. Where is everybody? -Bunch of guys out back lynching some queer. -(GRUFF) No shit! -Man, things are really tough. On top of everything else, my wife's cut me down to once a week now. -Oh, man. That's too bad. Things could be worse. -What do you mean? -I know two guys she cut off altogether. -Hey Lou, I saw some guy trying to screw your wife the other night. -Did he succeed? -No. -Then it wasn't my wife. -Two vodka martis. -Say, honey, I sure would love to get into your pants. -Sorry baby, one asshole in there is enough. -I'm as amazed as you are, Mrs. Koufax, but I sent these tests to the lab four times, and each time they come back positive-- pregnant. -Are you sure? But I'm 79, and Morris, my husband, is 84 years old. -I'm sorry, but there can be no doubt about it. You're pregnant. -Oh, that lousy bastard. That no-good son of a bitch. Oh, wait till I get-- I'll kill him. [RINGING] -Hello? -Morris, you lousy sex maniac, you know you got me pregnant, you son of a bitch, you? -Who is this? -Oh! -And then you can imagine my embarrassment, doctor, when on the night of our 25th anniversary, my husband told me I was really big down there. DOCTOR (OFFSCREEN): My goodness, what a large vagina. My goodness, what a large vagina. -Well, that may be true, doctor, but you didn't have to say it twice. -I didn't. -Well, you're in excellent shape, Mr. Goldberg. And I have some very good news for you. -Huh? -I was just talking to the lab. It's definite. You do not have VD. -Oh, thank God. I was so worried. I mean, what's it look like, a man of 74 with a social disease? Tell me doc, I still have a drip down there. If it's not VD, what is it? -Well, let me ask you a question. When were you last with a woman? -Well, I'm still pretty active, you know, for a man my age. -Yes, yes, yes, I'm sure. But when were you last with a woman? -About six weeks ago. -Well, you better get right back to her. You're just now coming. -Let's see now. [POUNDING] -Can't a guy get a breather around here? Jesus Christ. Come on in already. Come in. -Hi, Mr. Lassfinger, could I talk to you for a minute? -Kid, everybody wants to talk to me. I really can't be bothered. Can't you see I'm busy, huh? The accountants are coming first thing in the morning. I gotta get these books doctored up. Beat it, will ya? -Wait a minute. I want to break into show business. -All right, sit down, kid, huh? -Thank you. -Look, everybody wants the business. They all want it-- the lights, the glamour, the roar of the crowd. Look kid, showbiz is a jungle. It's a jungle out there. They'll tear you apart. -I want to stay right here until I get to show you my act. -You want to show me the act? OK, show it to me. Don't take up too much of my time. Just show it to me, then get out. [MUSIC_-_"SWANEE_RIVER"] -Wow. Kid, if that sound's coming where I think it's coming from, that's the greatest new act I've ever seen in my entire life. It'll make you-- us-- a fortune. Stay right where you are. Don't move a muscle. This is Lou Lassfinger. Get me the head of the Morris Agency, and hurry. [RINGING] -Yeah, hello? -Joe? Lou Lassfinger. I hate to wake you up at this time, but you're just not going to believe it. I found the greatest new act in show business. It'll make millions. It's a class act. I can't believe it. It's coast-to-coast television. Performances in England, London-- it's unbelievable, all over the world. -Well, it sounds great. Was is it? -Well, it's hard to explain to you. You'll have to hear it. Come on over, kid. This could be your big chance. Just give me about eight bars, baby. [MUSIC_-_"SWANEE_RIVER"] -Joe, how'd you like it? Great, wasn't it? -Why, you dumb son of a bitch. You mean, you wake me up in the middle of the morning just to hear some asshole play "Swanee River?" -Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Libido Theatre where tonight, Omar the Magnificent, one of the world's great lovers, will fuck 100 girls consecutively for your thrilling enjoyment. -Hey, listen to that crowd. Just listen to them, kid. This is the big time, and it's all for you, Omar-baby. Do you realize there's 5,000 screaming women out there that paid $10 apiece. Do you know how much money that is, kid? 50,000 clams, and it all belongs to you and me. I told you I'd put you on top, kid, you know what I mean? Just remember, watch your timing, don't knock yourself out during the preliminaries. It's in, out, and ADO-- short, quick strokes. You got it, baby? Good.

Once he did her wrong, she cut off his hair. So don't fuck around with love, baby. Don't fuck around with love. Birds and bees and flowers bloom in the spring. And everyone swing. Do it more than twice, and baby, you are the king. Don't fuck around with love. -Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. -Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. -Don't fuck around with love, baby. Don't fuck around with love. The moral of the story is be true to your own. Always remember your fathers themselves. So don't fuck around with love, baby. Don't fuck around with love. Fish in the water, they'll always be caught. A bird in the bush is better than not. Happiness is something that cannot be bought. Don't fuck around with, don't fuck around with don't fuck around with love!
