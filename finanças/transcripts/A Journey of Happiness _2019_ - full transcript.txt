What do you say to that? Well, the truth is to accompany everyone I have taken my leave despite the busy season Ian do you still remember this place? If I could revisit this sea of clouds one more time my life would be complete the greenery of Malaya beckons under the swaying coconut trees... Happiness is a result of our own efforts remember that? "Mom's funeral fee has been paid off" "dad is suffering from depression” "let's go a trip with him" "we are going for sea of clouds in genting highlands, Malaysia" "Ll will bear" "half of the travelling costs" "eighty percent" "all of it" How's things going? Push? He said to push the Van are you kidding me? We're not even see genting highlands yet now we have to push the Van? I didn't expect the local guide would give us such a bad vehicle I have spoken to the driver once the Van fixed we will go straight to that agency and lodge a complaint come on we have no choice Harder ok It's moving more harder wait for me close the door go Excuse me I am looking for fung please get me fung right now what are you staring at? Haven't you met a beauty before? Fung here you are I'm sorry it's hot in here and the air-con is broken here, cool down take this calm down yourself it's the Eve of Chinese new year, let's talk calmly all because of you who arranged a broken Van and the driver doesn't know how to fix it my family suffered on the road for almost an hour most importantly after travelling so long we have not arrive genting highlands you will upgrade our room to business suite with night scene and a free tour as compensation sitting in front of you I may look like a handsome amateur but the truth is I am a lot more with twenty years' experience in this industry plus, with a wide coverage of my networking in Malaysia the coverage of which is greater than your 4g phone so, any form of demands from customers I would have no problem fulfilling but, in this limited time your room may not be available fung I'm also from this industry don't you dare mess with me or else I will make an ugly scene surely during this Chinese new year season you wouln't want any problem you are really a Hong Kong attraction what do you mean what Hong Kong attraction?

Speak cantonese I said you look beautiful alright it's the chines new year I'll give you what you want that's better Little genting? Aren't we should go for sea of clouds at genting highlands? Sorry, the number you have reached is not in service that should be cold wind blowing on us but now there is nothing at all well, as a top rated tour guide you don't really think this trip is only as simple as visiting sea of clouds? Normally, things with "little" in its name are cute for example little kids or little themepark they are so cute so Little genting it's like genting highlands but cuter what about your dad? He is a fiasco you... Where is my bracelet? Where is my bracelet? Did you guys see it? It must have slipped off along the way airport... When the Van broke down... Roadside... The bracelet is important to me what's wrong with you? We couldn't reach genting highands no one answers your phonecall even your own bracelet has gone missing how useless can you be?

Did you guys know there's an aborigine tribe here called the lazy tribe why do they have this label? Because they're really lazy they stay in ancient tropical highlands but they don't plant anything and never seek jobs they only eat fruits and worms if they were out of food they would just hang around and rather die of hunger why aren't they extinct? Well thanks to the government they send them monthly rations to support their livelihood a life without having to work so nice in my next life I hope to born into this tribe better than having you guys there's no peaceful retirement now so what food did the government provide? Hippopotamus... Sorry I couldn't stop the car put on your safety belts careful dad in 500m ahead, you will reach kampung jalan Lima in 400m ahead, you will reach kampung jalan Lima in 300m ahead, you will reach kampung jalan Lima why can't it stop?

Open the window open the door you have damaged their property come out at once you're the homestay owner, orchid?

See orchid you must be loaded [t's not about the load, it's the love I live happier that way now hurry here I come - move the things they can't do it "the sun is coming out" "there is a sun" "the sun is coming out" "there is a sun" "grandpa is telling a long time story” "the ear of rice is blown by the wind" nice Chinese new year vibes here indeed glad you liked it by the way I'm having dinner with family relatives many have returned from overseas why don't you join us? That sounds interesting we could help out in the kitchen yeah I can help great let's do the cooking I can cook any style you want let me help brother pass me the cooking oil not the soy sauce that one can't you see the red eagle oil? It needs some light soy sauce right brother light soy sauce here you go now add some vegetarian oyster sauce done isn't it fragrant? Cheers mom your son is home fung, you're home orchid is hugging... About the matter of hugging Malaysians are warm and friendly it's normal to do hugging here don't be alarmed not that orchid is hugging fung fung? Wait a minute you finished all the dishes? Without waiting up? How was it? Isn't my mom great at cooking? We look so alike it's obvious we're mom and son your aunt sent you angpow angpow she asked you to get married soon alright another aunt gave you this let me finish wear this to get charming girls could you ask her to stop bothering me sorry we spoke the hokkien dialect orchid that's a beautiful bracelet may I ask for one, too? Thank you dad what's a guy's business wanting this? Let me be you cousin has not arrived? Oh my god aunty I'm back you're back pumpkin? The girl from butterworth, penang how do you know we're from butterworth, penang? Orchid, you are so strong juggling with all these thanks for your help too I am grateful thank you I haven't heard anyone thanking me for a long time Actually, you're like my mom ever since we suddenly lost her it never felt the same home again every time I go back whatever that I do can never replace her place at home I hope she can forgive me don't be silly no mom ever wanted a replacement you are her daughter why would you want to replace her? I believe all parents have the same fear, that one day they wouldn't be able to pamper their children I believe that's what your mom were thinking I really miss my mom I know my dad miss her too but I don't know how to console him I fear my family may forget her one day so I tried very hard to do what mom would normally do I am trying my best, I really am but they seem to not care at all all home-cooked meals have the same base which is rice but how much water do you use to cook it? Using a electric cooker or traditional charcoal fire? It all depends on members of that family as defined by their tastebuds so really, it's not up to you alone if you didn't cook well today try again tomorrow if you didn't do well tomorrow go rest for a couple of days, and try again I have no doubt that one day you will make the most delicious and most satisfying home-cooked meal Actually, I really hope to have someone cook for me well, my son is quite talented you could consider him all I'm thinking now is to help dad find his scenic sea of clouds so that he doesn't forget mom I'm sorry I'm sorry Why are you apologising? Because I lied to you actually it's your family you should apologise to do you know why I ask people to go vegetarian? Why? Because I don't want to see anyone be separated from their family no matter human or animal we have so little time to be with loved ones I don't want to see what little time we have left be taken away as well now I understand why you have so many followers you are real not like me I'm a fake if you have a choice between two hundred thousand followers and three family members which one would you choose? So many stars so beautiful yeah it's so beautiful here My fellow tour mates why are you so late? We woke up early let's go then sure "the fourth day of Chinese new year" this is it I remember now I was with you mom here climbing these flights of stairs come on be careful please be careful let us go have a look you can wait here no way be careful don't be so stubborn you have weak legs don't force yourself ok? Look, if we discovered the sea of clouds we'll come back and get you wait here yes, please wait here we'll be right back have a seat we'll go please hurry There's nothing here let's go I saw nothing up there where's the sea of clouds? Dad fung was right finding it is a matter of luck since there's nothing here let's go home this can't be we should get a car let us go look around it must be somewhere here if we don't find the sea of clouds I'm not going home what? We have looked from that tall tower it's really not around anywhere maybe I've made a mistake maybe it's wrong information on the web perhaps there is no such view neither in genting nor Cameron highlands there must be I've been here before with your mom I have the photograph please don't be stubborn dad all three of us have seen with our own eyes there was nothing how could it be here? Perhaps you were mistaken? You're getting old maybe your memory isn't good that photograph could have been taken in other place? Now look here I do not have depression or Alzheimers I'm still thinking clearly when I was a worker in Hong Kong I could navigate the entire place I'm great at finding my way around I can find it myself that was Hong Kong this is Malaysia look at those sign boards they're in english you can't read those how do you find your way? How do you find your sea of clouds? What I have is experience trust me experience? The last time we trust your experience we put all our family savings in your investments and lost it all in the financial crisis because of you mom had to suffer a difficult life don't speak like this to our dad oh shut up save it, sis it's your fault too we never wanted to come to this trip but you insisted to show-off using your own money to treat dad to this trip what's happened now? There's nothing here you are such an idiot so you played behind my back? Using money to show-off? Now I'm the old fool in eyes of the family What else do you want from me? Why are men always so righteous here? At least I'm the one who give the most effort for the family could it be that you are still angry with me that I wasn't at mom's deathbed because I couldn't get back in time? You think I wanted that? Flight ticket availability is not something I can control "Waiting for you to come back day and night" "When will you be back” "coming back for my dizzy tears eyes" Do you know this place? No? No? It's a big span of clouds take a taxi over there "the fifth day of Chinese new year" you guys leaving me of a small quarrel? Where are you guys? What is this?

You were born in the year of rat Actually, the family looked forward to your return because if you are here we will be so much happy and no fear at all I'm not sure if we're able to survive here? We'll be fine don't think too much dad, shiu sum dad where are you guys? Shiu sum brother baby we're here over here I've told you guys if you're looking for the sea of clouds must along with a mountain guide I agree going it without us? Still dare to shout for "have no fear, shiu sum is here"? Dad if you two did not turn up I would have decided to to sever our father-son relationship camp site we're almost there just around the corner There's even a singing session there's even a bbq party Do you want some? It's very fresh let's sing Chinese new year songs and eat together? I'll join leave me out of it why must we sing to earn the bbq? Why is it related? Even when I sell property to my clients there were never request to sing songs I didn't know you have clients at all "prosperity is here..." "Kindness begets more" "remember..." "Fortune is for the principled" "prosperity is here..." "Let us march together" "earn what you deserve" "shape the future today" "earn what you deserve" "shape the future today" "earn what you deserve" "shape the future today" Brother what happened?

Be careful be careful, dad go over there to get sheltered covered with this I think we shouldn't stay here the mountain guide said even if there were no rain we may not see the clouds Hold it up, brother The rain has stopped We should go fung was right it depends on luck seeing a sea of clouds is a matter of fate we have tried there's no regret this trip is a fiasco not really, we have put in efforts it doesn't matter if we see the view or not as long as we do it as one family I'm contented alright let's pack up Come dad, turn around what happened?

Ian let's take a family portrait 3, 2,1, smile This time, I'm glad to have shiu sum dad are you happy? My dear daughter Sister don't you know that this man-made one we can actually make it at home we could use back the turtle tank and stayed home to do it so we don't need to travel so far how would it be the same? You still don't get it you guys were actually right dad slowly almost there Even when I asked to have a dinner or take a family portrait they were too busy to make it back well, the truth is we will travel as a family this year and I have taken my leave in this busy season it's been so long how's things? He said to push the Van aren't we going to genting for the sea of clouds? You're a loser you all are losers I've told you guys we shouldn't have taken this trip I wish mom is still here one caught soliciting one for public nudity one for animal abuse and all ended up here in prison happiness is a result of our own efforts remember that? Seeing the sea of clouds actually isn't the important the most important things is we have been through all the difficulties and our family is getting bonded now it's all over mom I have seen the sea of clouds with the family With this beautiful scenery could you stop taking the selfie it's not that are you ready with your pose?
