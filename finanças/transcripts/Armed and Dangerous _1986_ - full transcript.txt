Hi. What seems to be the trouble? I lost my kitty. He's up there. In the tree, huh? Oh, yeah, there he is. Boy, he's up there high. I wouldn't worry about him. He'll be fine. He'll probably come down in a couple days. Cats like to climb trees. They're good at it. He'll get hungry, and he'll come down and see you. Don't cry. What's the cat's name? Fluffy. Fluffy, huh? Okay. Fluffy. Come here, Fluffy. I'll be right down. Oh... Okay. All right. Yeah. Come on, Fluffy. Fluffy. Hello, Fluffy. Come on. Come on, Fluffy. Here you go. Come on, Fluffy. Atta-Fluffy. Yeah, Fluffy. Hey, I got him. Oh... Oh, my God. Don't move. Would you quit moving? Come on, don't do that. Don't do that. You wanna hurry up? Huh? Come on, this cat's nervous. That's far enough. Get up. Get up. Get against the car! Easy! - Don't move. - I'm a cop. Mel, what are you doing? Jesus, Frank. You almost killed me. Would you take it easy? Well, I'm very sorry. You wanna explain what you're doing here? Hello, Rizzo. What are you doing? I'll give you one guess. Uh, stealing television sets? Hey, he's not as dumb as he looks, huh? Bite the bag, Rizzo. Your ass is grass. Frank, take the TV set. Let's get the hell out of here. I already own a TV set. Unh. Frank. Think about it, Frank. You take the goddamn TV set and keep your big mouth shut. Internal Affairs. Don't move. Freeze. It's okay. It's okay, boys. We got him covered. Hey, this ain't mine. Sorry, Frank. It is now. This court Looks upon corruption with great disdain. You should be ashamed of yourself for betraying the trust and responsibility that was placed upon you. Do you have anything to say for yourself, officer? I'm sorry. Mr. Dooley. I didn't do it, Your Honor. Your Honor, given the fact that Officer Dooley has been fined and dismissed by the police department, the state feels it is appropriate to move for dismissal. All right, but I don't like it. Motion granted. Dismissed. Next case. Call prisoner Lawrence Lupik. Unh! Thank you very much. Thank you. Made my day, really. Thank you. Is the defense counsel present? Here, Your Honor. In case number 867810, the defendant is charged with three counts of breaking and entering, five counts of armed robbery, three counts of kidnapping-- Right on. Order in the court, or I'll have you all removed. one count of extortion, two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and five counts of assault with the intent to kill. Mr. Lupik, how do you plead? Your Honor, I-- If I go to jail, I'll kill you. It's good. Your Honor, may I approach the bench? Well, if you must. Your Honor, I'm prepared to plead Mr. Lupik guilty on the armed robbery charge, if the people will reduce the assaults to resisting arrest and agree to suspend sentence. What about kidnapping and extortion? He didn't mean it, Your Honor. You call that plea-bargaining? Where the hell did you go to law school? I just feel that a long prison sentence is not warranted in this case. The police found rugs in his apartment made out of human hair. Well, bad taste is not a crime, Your Honor, last time I checked the statutes. Your Honor, I feel this whole thing falls under a sociopsychological, you know, kind of umbrella. Uh, I sincerely feel that the facts are completely irrelevant in this case. Let me put it this way, Your Honor. He says if he goes to jail, he's gonna kill me. Now, I don't usually believe every psychopath I defend, but I happen to believe this guy. Mr. Kane, you are without a doubt one of the worst lawyers I've ever seen. Oh, well, then, I move for a mistrial. Shut up. Yes, sir. Furthermore, it's obvious to me that you're having some sort of a breakdown. So this is what I suggest: You plead your client guilty on all counts, and I'll give him a sentence so long, he won't even remember his own name, let alone yours. Then you promise to find a new line of work for yourself with a lot less responsibility, okay? Yes, sir. Thank you. The world is a shithole, full of shitty little scumbags who are scared shitless. With dedication... You think he's a little anal? I think he's right. Now, this badge will lift you out of that scum, into a $12-billion-a-year industry. My name is Captain O'Connell, and I welcome you to the world of private security. Any questions? Yeah? You mean we're gonna actually earn $12 billion a year? No, you're gonna earn $4.60 an hour. Which is starting pay for everyone, regardless of age, sex, race, color or intelligence. You work 10 hours, you make $46. Now, let me get this straight. If you wanted to work, say, 3 billion hours, I could roughly pull in over $12 billion if I was eager enough and put the time in? - Any more questions? - Yes. Where it says "name"--? Look. Here on the application. Do I put my name? Huh? Yeah. Oh, thank you, sir. Where it says "police record," does that mean felonies or misdemeanors? Both. Oh. Well, can I write on the back, then? I don't think I'm gonna have room. We got lots of extra paper if you need it. Now, you've all had a chance to read the booklet "Careers in Private Security." You look like a guy who defended me once on an assault charge. Oh, really? Did you get off? I got three years. There are two functions-- - No, wasn't me. - -for a security guard. Excuse me, I'm gonna stand up and stretch the old legs. But no matter what you do, your primary responsibility is always the same: To observe and report. But should you witness a crime or violation... Interesting group of people. - Yeah, to Freud, maybe. - However, you can detain somebody Norman Kane. and use force if necessary Frank Dooley. until the police arrive. Any questions? Yeah? Yeah. Let's say somebody lying, right? And you know they lying. Can you shoot them? Well, it depends. Use your own judgment. Thank you. I appreciate that. Any other questions? Yes, I have a question concerning our powers of arrest. The statutes governing citizen's arrest really aren't very clear. Will we be indemnified by the company against Lawsuits or prosecution resulting from wrongful arrest complaints? What are you, a lawyer? No. No. No. No, what I mean to say is, if I detain a shoplifter, let's say, and he turns out to be innocent and, um, he sues me for a million dollars, what happens? What happens? You spend the rest of your life paying for it. And you die miserable and broke. So don't screw up. - Thank you. - Now, the fee for the course is $51.50. Don't worry. I'm an ex-cop. You stick with me, I'll keep you out of trouble. Which you can pay now, or we can deduct it from your first paycheck. In addition, as licensed security guards, you'll be required to join a union. The International Alliance of Special Police and Guards. These are your union representatives. Mr. Klepper and Mr. Lazarus. Thank you, Clarence. The initiation fee is $30, payable now. Now, if you can't pay, don't worry. We'll deduct it from your first paycheck. Thereafter, the weekly dues will be $15 and will be deducted automatically. The forms are in front of you on the desk. Sign them and pass them forward. Any questions? Uh, yes, I have a question. Ahem. Minor point. What if we don't wanna join? This is a union shop. You wanna work, you join. Well, I don't wanna speak out of school, but $15 a week, to me, seems excessive. Now, where does this money go? Well, that money goes to your pension and welfare fund. Ah. And when are the benefits paid? When you're 65. - Sixty-five? - Hey. What's with all the questions? This is your union. It's for your own protection. So shut up and sign the fucking form. Do you have a pen? As you can see, it's really quite simple. Just remember, when you pull the trigger, the bullets come out going very, very fast. So make sure to keep the weapon pointed away from you. Now, that's about it. You are now armed guards. God help us all. So return to your positions and load your guns, but do not, I repeat, do not commence firing until I have left the target area. Thank you. You won't Lie to me no more. Take that, you scumbag. Nice shooting, soldier. I can't tell you how much I hate this. What's your problem? What's my problem? This is a dangerous weapon here. It can hurt somebody. I-- I can't shoot it. I-- I don't have it in me. You see that turd in the red plaid shirt who's gonna blow your head off? Watch. Do you wanna be partners? Raise your right hand, repeat after me. - I... - I... - State your name. - State your name. Do solemnly swear to uphold the laws of the state of California and government of the United States in the exercise of my duties as a special officer... --in the exercise of my duties as a special officer under the provisions of the Private Guard Act... --safety and security of the persons or property placed in my charge. --placed in my charge. - Okay, that's it. - Here are your diplomas. Fill them out if your name's not on it. You're now fully licensed security guards. Congratulations. Report to Sergeant Cavanaugh for your assignments. That's it? Yeah. Class of Thursday, 3:30 p.m. Congratulations. - Kane. - Yes, right here. Carlex Pharmaceuticals. Night shift, starting tomorrow. That's it? Just like that, huh? Mr. Kane, there are only two things that you have to remember: Never fall asleep where anyone can see you, and make sure your name is very clearly marked on your lunch. Well, I can handle that. I'm gonna put you with Dooley here. Hey, Dooley? Yeah? You're working with Kane. Oh, good. I'll keep an eye on him for you. No. I was hoping that he could keep an eye on you. Kokolovitch. She likes me. Can you drive? Yeah. Pick me up tomorrow. Hardtronics. Make a left. Guards Norman Kane and Frank Dooley reporting-- I love to watch a professional at work, don't you? I think this job's gonna be really, really good, Frank. You know, it's just what I need right now. Hey, you wanna slow down? What, are you trying to suck up your first day on the job? No, it's just-- In such a big hurry to do nothing? Wow. - Look at those monsters. - Jimmy, get the dog off my head! I can't! Get in there! You wanna pet them? Come on, we'll go pet them. Norman Kane, Frank Dooley, night shift. Here are your building layouts and your time clock locations. Take lunch at 11:30. And stay out the annex. Pay attention, fat boy. It's canine control. You got it? Duh, yeah, I-- I think so. Don't be a smart-ass, Dooley. Now go and relieve the day shift. Yes, sir. Yeah, come on, let's go be security guards. What did you call him? A muscle-bound jerk? What? He's not. He's a nitwit, but he's no muscle-bound jerk. Enough. Maybe he thought I was crazy to keep trying. In your judgment, was your ship on the verge of foundering when the executive officer assumed command? Dooley. Yeah? I told y'all to take lunch at 11:30. So? So? It's 11:45. It's against the rules to be in a working area during breaks or meals. Hey, man, read my lips. Report to the cafeteria. Can I just catch the end of this movie? Now! Oh, what a bullshit rule. Come on, let's go grab some lunch. Well, I left my lunch in the car, Frank, so I'll meet you in the caf, all right? Yeah, right. Save me a seat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, how about a lift? Hey, you jerk. Hi, fellas. How's it going? Ski masks? Guys, I got news for you. It's not that cold tonight. Don't you have someplace you're supposed to be? No, not right now. I'm on lunch break. Half an hour. Saw you guys working, thought I'd come by and say hello. Do you fellas have an invoice for this shipment? You're kidding, right? A bill of lading, perhaps? Look, Kane. We got special permission to take this stuff. Well! So you say. But I gotta check it out back at the office. You couldn't be that stupid. Oh, I don't know. I think I could be. - Yes? - Absolutely. Wait a minute. I'm warning you. You guys are asking for big trouble. Ah! Frank, come in. I'm being chased. Two men in ski masks. Help. Help. Frank. Frank, I'm in the loading dock area. Come in. You made me run. I hate running. Guys, I'm gonna level with you. Take whatever you want. Because I don't care. I'm not a company man. Oh, you don't need those. You don't need those. You shoot me, you're gonna have guilt. You're dead meat, pal. Oh, God! Ha-ha-ha. Yeah. Freeze! Holy shit. Guard Dog Security. Respond, please. Hello. Hi. You two are doing a great job. I'm gonna kill those guys. Anthony, let's go. Get in the truck, we're leaving. Ah! Ah! Oh, ah. Ow! Oh, you wanna play rough, do you? All right, let's play rough. Come on. Let that be a lesson to you, you mutts. I don't suppose you can identify any of them? Well, yeah, sure, I think it was the U.S. Olympic downhill team. I told you, they were wearing ski masks. How about you? Can you describe any of them? Sort of, except for their heads. Um, there were two guys. The big guy was, um... big. And the smaller guy was-- Smaller? You're a regular Dick Tracy. Well, I'm sorry, sir, I was scared. When people are chasing you with guns, you don't stop and ask them how much they weigh. Now, listen up and listen good. Last night was a major disaster. If you ever screw up like that again, you're out. Do you hear me? Out! And just so you don't forget, I'm fining each of you 100 bucks. Now get out of here. Get out of here! Why, you... Dooley, Kane. What'd he say? Are you in trouble? No, no, he let us off with a fine and some very bad breath. We bust our asses for 4.60 an hour, and he treats us like criminals! I'm gonna complain to the union, that's what I'm gonna do, because it's not fair. That man is a jerk! And he's a subhuman, moronic... poop-head. He's my father. Well, I'm sure he has his good points. Oh, sure he does. He's salt of the earth. Qualities of a s
