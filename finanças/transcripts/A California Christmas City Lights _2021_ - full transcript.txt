How about a story? Let's see. Where to begin? Last year, our dairy farm officially opened the Bernet Farm Wine Vineyards. Even though we don't have to step on grapes to make wine nowadays, I convinced my sister that grapes squishing between your toes makes people happy. It was my mom's favorite. I spent most weekends learning everything there is about dairy farming so I can help out even more around here. I had the best teachers. Well, teacher. My sister Callie still runs the place, of course. And with the extra money from the wine, we were finally able to hire some extra farmhands. And yet, Callie never stops getting her hands dirty, but I've never seen her so happy. Okay. Come this way. No dust got in any eyes. Right? Manny here is not only our property manager but our esteemed vintner and sommelier. Hmm. - Now, Manny. - Yes. Have you tried this bottle yet? I have never met you. And I have never tried this bottle before. Okay. Feast your eyes. - Birch sap. - Mm. Honeysuckle. Chocolat. And ground coriander! It's a gift. No. I've been practicing a lot. But we all know moms makes the best guardian angels. I know she's here with us every day. Especially today. Hey, Hannah. Are you ready to do this? Yeah. Let's go. - Hey. Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Let's practice. - What? Oh. I'm gonna get it! And you guys are here on a very special day because today we are paying homage to the innovation of historical... Of, uh... uh... uh, very, uh, historical innovations and... While including the new innovations of wine-making introduced over the past few years. Nailed it. Speaking of innovations, you guys are trying the newest addition. Would you like to see him try another one? No! You guys need to stay safe. Okay? Can't be drinking that much. Uh, well... well, there's a Syrah. I think you should show them how... - Joseph! - Hey! How's everybody doing today? Good? Everyone, this is Joseph Van Aston, my boyfriend. Oh. Okay. You taking a... a wine break, babe? Yes, yes. Yes, I am. H... he loves the wine. It was exactly one year ago that I stumbled onto this property and became a ranch hand. And I didn't know it at the time... ...but it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Callie, I know what life is like without you. And I know what life is like with you. And it would be my honor and privilege... to spend the rest of this life with you. So, Callie Bernet... ...will you marry me? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! All right! Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Get a room. Ew! - I'm gonna go to bed. - Okay. Oh. It means so much to me that you guys up and left the tour for this. Congratulations, Cal. Thank you. Yeah. I, uh... I gotta go too. I... I got a date. With me. - I do? - Mm-hmm. Somebody may have downloaded Deep Down Under on the Ocu-VR, and it may put us in a shark tank in South Africa, where it breaks, you swim, you live, you die. You die! Yes! I'm gonna set that up right now. Hey. Don't stay out too late. You got a big delivery at sunup. Yes, sir. Ma'am. So, you gonna stick around for a few days? No. Just tonight. Got the big annual gala coming up, and it's, you know, lots to do. Gala? That sounds fancy. More like overblown and extravagant. I never heard you complain before. It's not really my thing anymore. I'd much rather be here with you. - Well, we'd love to have you, sir. - Now. Do it. Both of you. Uh, we're gonna pass. Callie, can I... can I borrow you for a second? I, uh... I need your advice. Uh, yeah, sure. I'll be right back. It's been over a year, sir. The city misses you. Does it? Mm. Well, I do. Partner! Are you coming or not? So, what's up, lover boy? Okay. Shut it. We're just friends. Look, she needed a tour manager. I needed a change of scenery. You know the deal. Hmm. Friends don't travel the country together in a tiny trailer. Polaroid time! Here. Let me take it. - The ring. - Okay. Oh. All right. All right. Straight to the kneecaps! Straight to the kneecaps! - Oh. Whoa, whoa. - Shark! Shark! Let me out! Let me out! Get your character off my ear, Leo! Get off! - Yes! - Yes! - Yes! - Yes! Yes! That must have been amazing. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. What did you wanna talk to me about? Um... Oh. I, uh... It doesn't matter. - Mm-hmm. - We gotta go. - Bye. - Bye, Cal. Uh, go check on Joseph. Upstairs. - Hmm. - What?

Oh. Thank you. Hey. I've been waiting for this all morning. That was supposed to be mine. Mm-mm. I got some good news. Sick order this a.m. We got 30 cases of the Cabernet Blend, 30 cases of the Syrah, and 25 cases of the Noir. What? I wonder who the buyer is. Van Aston Enterprises? F... for their holiday gala. The overblown extravaganza? Yes, but it could be great marketing for the winery. Last year we had 50 cases of Jensen's going for $21 a pour. Joseph, this is amazing. That's my boy, right there! Don't come any closer. You know what? Don't touch me, dude. Sore loser. My K/D ratio is higher than yours. Whatever. Joseph, can I speak to you for a second, please? Yeah. Sure. I thought you were headed back. I overslept. - There's something I need you to know. - What? Remember that wellness retreat your mother took the C-suites to back in October? Yeah, yeah. They went to some island to shove wheatgrass up... Spare me the details. There's, uh... there's a way to say this. Um... She's Downward Dogging with the sexy sutra kata Shavasana man in Tahiti, and she's not coming back. Long story short, she ran away with her yoga instructor. And she's left the company in your name. What? Why am I just now hearing about this? Because I didn't wanna spoil yesterday with the news. But don't worry. Victoria is there. She's trying... Please tell me they didn't leave Victoria in charge. - The board voted her in as temporary CEO. - Ugh. - She's got them wrapped around her finger. - She doesn't care about the company. She was your mom's right hand. But things are falling apart. The suppliers are dropping like flies. I know you needed a break. And I... and I appreciate that for you and Callie. But this is your father's company we're talking about. He's gotta be rolling in his grave right now. Why would my mother just leave everything behind? Because of you and Callie. Your love. It inspired her to find one of her own. Okay. I'll go. Do a little damage control but only for a little while. - I guess I owe my mother a call. - Uh, don't bother. Cell service is nonexistent on the island. Yeah. Take a break. I'll fill you in. So pump number seven is out again. I've tried and tried to fix it but... Okay. Call the manufacturer and tell them to send us a new one. You want to replace the valve. I'll check if the supply levels are even. - Okay. Thank you. - Yep. Hello! Hi! Surprise! - Oh my God! Oh my God! - Oh my God! I'm so bummed I missed your proposal last night. I had to pass my anatomy final. It's fine. You weren't supposed to be here for a few days. I know. I just couldn't wait. Well, where is he? - Oh. - I can't wait to meet him! All right, the supply levels are even. - Congratulations! - What? Oh! I'm Brandy. Best friend, maid of honor, etcetera, and now we're gonna be best friends too, of course. Okay! Get in here. - Okay. - Best day of my life. I'm so excited! - Hey. What did I miss? - I love this! Uh, Brandy, this is Joseph, my fiancé. Hey. Hey. Yay. What's going on? And this is Manny, our property manager. - And your new best friend. - You are actually coworkers now. - Coworkers? - Yes. Brandy is studying to be an on-field livestock veterinarian and needs a few extra credits for her internship. So I'm gonna be moving in for a few months! Yay! Fiesta! Fiesta! Fiesta! Fiesta! - Yay! - Hey! So, tell me about this gala that cleared out our entire winter stash. Well, technically, it is the Van Aston Enterprises City Holiday Alliance Gala. That's a mouthful. We woo our shareholders and potential investors with elaborate decorations and a fancy meal, and then all the suppliers show up and schmooze with them and the board of direct... It... it's very fascinating stuff. - Cal. - Hmm? You know I... I love you, right? And our life here. What's going on? I gotta go to the city for a while. - How long? - I don't know. But I was hoping that you could come with me to San Francisco. We can finally have some time to ourselves. Celebrate. Plan the wedding. There's a reason we haven't had a day off all year long, Joseph. Oh, we're running this place on autopilot. And I've been... I've been wanting to take you to San Francisco for a while now. We can hire extra help. Manny can manage the farm and the winery. And... and Brandy, she can keep an eye on Hannah. Wow. You've got this thing all planned out, don't you? And now I feel guilt coming in from all sides. What do you mean? I guess part of me kept him so busy around here so we wouldn't have time to go visit the city. Cal. I'm worried we'll get there, he'll miss his old life. I don't know. I just... I don't want anything to change. Cal, you're getting married. Okay? Change is inevitable. And who knows? Maybe you'll fall in love with his world the way that he fell in love with yours. You deserve this. It's okay to let a little light in. Okay. What would your mom say? I can feel her here, you know. Me too. Hannah, what time do you catch the bus this morning? - 7:50. - So, right now! Wait. Come here. I'm gonna miss you. You listen to Manny and Brandy when I'm gone, okay? And do all your schoolwork without them having to ask. Schoolwork? It's the last day before Christmas break. - Already? - Good. I'll need an extra set of hands. Mwah. Oh. The veterinarian comes three days a week for health management on the farm. Manny, you're on your own those days so Brandy can chat with the vet. - No problem. - Mm-hmm. If you need an extra hand or two, the ranch hands on the Drew farm are looking for some extra days. - There are the numbers to call. - Got it. And remember, on Sunday after 3:00 p.m... ...it's "buy a bottle, take a bottle with your tour ticket." - I got it, Callie. - Okay. All right. Our ride is almost here! Ugh. Hang on a second. Um, I... - We've got this. Go! - Okay. Okay. Wow. What? My clothes look great on you. Okay. We really gotta go. - All right. See you later. - Have fun. Don't you worry. Old Manny and Brandy. We got this. That's inappropriate. Excuse me. Oh my God! What? Welcome. So what is all this? Those are the most updated reports on all suppliers and divisions of Van Aston Enterprises. Enjoy. And so it begins. Hey, Johnny. - It's Rogelio. - It's Rogelio. I knew that. I knew that. Okay. Hot enough for you? It's me. Uh... I think we're off to a great start. With what? Uh, you know, just both of us handling the ranch. It's been two hours. Two hours? It's been a really great two hours. - Can I help you with something? - Can I help you with something? No, um... No. I got my, uh, lane handled here. So, uh, can I help you with... with something? Nope. Got my lane handled right here. Well, if you need anything, uh, I'll just come back around here and check up on you. - Okay, then. - Okay, then. - I'll talk to you later, partner. - Bye. - Okay. - Okay. Right this way. Don't worry about your bags. I'll have them waiting for you in your room. Oh.

We miss you, Jay. Oh. You look good. Here. Joseph Van Aston, in the flesh. Mwah. It's cute. Uh, well... Callie, this is... this is Tiffany. - Gina and... and... and Lily. - Gina. We... we were friends back in the day. Friends? That's what you're calling it. Yeah. We, uh... we really missed our friendship, Joey. Maybe we can all be friends. - Yeah. I like that. - That's bad, right? Oh my God! - Whoa. No! - What is that? - I didn't think I'd see the day. - That is amazing. Is it real? - You kind of look like me. - It's so pretty. - It's almost like we're... - Joseph. I'll see you later. - Yeah. - Call me. Bye, sweetheart. You're so cute. Good to see you, darling. Victoria. No scruff? Cute. And you must be the future Mrs. Van Aston. - Callie. - Oh, honey, I know who you are. I've heard so much about you. Nice to meet you. God, you're gorgeous. She's gorgeous. Tell me. How are you feeling? Snagging the Roosevelt Room for a wedding venue's unheard of nowadays. You must be floating. Think of me as an older sis, if you will. Text me if you need anything at all while you're here. Okay? Have fun tonight. We have a lot of business to cover, Jay. Mm-hmm. Uh... Here we are. Any more surprises? Maybe just one or two. This suite means a lot to the city. The history here is pretty amazing. Actually, a lot of presidents have stayed here. Now, this is what I've been dying to show you. Welcome to San Francisco. Callie, I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about... The wedding venue? It's just on hold. Okay? Since when? My mom booked it when I told her I was gonna propose. A wedding gift of sorts. But it's not such a terrible idea. The venue is beautiful. It's just downstairs. What's the date? Hmm? Joseph. Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve this year? I... I know. I know. It... it sounds crazy, but hear me out. Petaluma is just an hour away. So your friends and family can come in the evening. We have hotel rooms blocked off. The whole nine. All we have to do is show up. And it's Christmas Eve. You know, I can't think of a better Christmas gift than waking up next to you knowing that you're my wife. I will think about it. Yes! That's all I'm asking. Also, I have a few friends that wanna meet you, so I was thinking about taking you out tonight. Show you off a little bit. This place is wild. So, where is it we're going tonight? Well, first, we need to get you out of this and into that. - How did you... - You can thank Victoria. Oh. Hmm. ♪ The way she moves has got me frozen ♪ ♪ In place I can't move my toes ♪ ♪ She's the dream Standing in front of me ♪ ♪ She makes me feel Like I'm losing control ♪ ♪ Losing control ♪ ♪ Push my buttons In all the right places ♪ ♪ Playing games... ♪ Uh...

You should feel a head or some legs. Brandy. Hey, uh... ...I was thinking since it's almost dinnertime, you know, I can, uh, go down to the deli and, uh, you know, we can maybe eat outside. Yeah. I'll take a sloppy joe. - Sloppy joe? That's what you want? - Out of everything you want a... - With extra ranch, please. - Good. Extra ran... Okay. All right. You got it. Extra ranch. Is he gonna be okay? Probably not. Hmm. Aren't ranch hands supposed to not be grossed out by stuff like that? Who're you calling a ranch hand? - Sorry. Property manager. - Thank you. Never gets old. So, what did she say? Oh. Well... She's in. She wants a sloppy joe with some ran... Sounds like a date to me, Romeo. It's a date. Hmm. And the venue is gorgeous. It's just... It's on hold for Christmas Eve this year. Cay, are you kidding? That's in, like, three weeks. Is he insane? Sorry, Joseph. He's not here. He's in the conference room, taking a call. But yes, it is insane. But why not? I already went through planning a wedding with Liam that never happened. I'd be lying if the thought of doing it all over again didn't make me cringe. And a wedding during Christmas Eve is pretty magical. Right? Mm-hmm. So... So... let's do it? Let's do it. Let's do it! Okay. So It's settled. You'll get married in three weeks. Moving on. Put on the dress. Okay. Ooh. Oh no. Okay, remember our ninth-grade homecoming dance? Wow. You look... Wow. It's like you've never seen me in a dress before. - Have I? - Shut up. Joseph, let's do it. Let's get married on Christmas Eve. Really? Are you sure? Y... you don't think it's too soon? No. I mean, it's like you said, "Why wait?" And I honestly can't imagine a better Christmas gift to each other than, well... ...each other. Oh my God, the dress. Look what you did with it. Yeah. It was just a little much, so I... It was $2,200. It's pretty great, though. Right? Wait till you see her in a wedding dress in a few weeks. It sounds like I need to officially lock in the venue. That's him. Hey. Hey, Mr. Van Aston! What are you so famous for, again? Get used to it, honey. Comes with the last name. Cheers. Oh. It's Joseph. I thought we were meeting a few of your friends. This is a few of my friends. Joseph! Finally, you grace us with your presence. Kane, you look so good. - Stop. It's the Versace. - [Callie chuckles[ You must be Callie. Nice to meet you. I always thought we'd end up together.

I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. Look, I've been meaning to call. I know it's been forever since Liam's funeral, and I just... Don't worry about it. I... I've been crazy busy up here. - And it takes two to start a conversation. - Callie. There you are. - Hey, man. - Hey. Small world. Callie and I grew up together. Owen was... Well, is Liam's older brother. Wow. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize. No sweat. I... I don't bring the heavy stuff to work. I'm really happy for you both.

I don't know what I thought your life looked like in the city, but I never expected it to be so... ...much. What you saw up there was just a small piece of my old life. Right here with you, now that's where I belong. That was good. Well, it's the truth. Okay, so, this is the Roosevelt Room. If we lock in the venue, no pressure, this is where we would have our first dance as husband and wife. It's beautiful. Mrs. Van Aston. May I have this dance? And I should warn you. I was a childhood prodigy ballroom dancer. Oh. Was that before or after I taught you how to two-step? It was before. Yeah. - Ow. - Oh my gosh, I am so sorry. Sorry. - I'm fine.

Oh, these photos are gorgeous. Wait. What does that say? "A Christmas Eve wedding at the Van Aston Standard Hotel." How do they know this already? I only agreed last night. I'm feeling royal wedding vibes. You need a dress. Oh my God! I have my mom's dress, but is it enough for a royal wedding? I... Uh... I, um... Come on. Please. Um... I gotta call you back. Okay. Call me. Bye. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Was that delicious? - Oh, yeah. My mouth totally tastes like Windex, so... - Hmm. Well, mine taste like sandwich, so... - A match made in heaven. - Hmm. - Do you wanna bounce? Because I was thinking of maybe using my singular combat weapon. Well, not until you find my critical hit location. My goodness. Hiya, girl. Hi. You don't look so good. Huh? Ugh. No wonder. Callie. - Owen. - So good to see you again. Again. Hi. Harry. Good morning. - I wasn't expecting you. - Save it. Attaching the risk percentage of each unsigned agreement here. If nothing changes, this loss is horrendous. I'm expecting a plan of some kind in the morning. My flight's at 9:00 a.m. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Thank you for stopping by. - If your mother was here... - Well, she's not. Have a safe flight, Harry. Please explain to me why the CFO flew from New York City this morning to personally hand me a copy of the redlines that you left unopened and neglected for months. The mail was addressed to your mother. Yeah, but when you stepped into her role, you had to take on her responsibilities, Victoria. Oh, stop. It's all about the gala, Joseph. I need to focus my attention on that and not some stupid paperwork. Then who's gonna do it? Well, that's why you're here. Isn't it? Look. It's not just about the taxes and the bills. We're dropping suppliers left and right. Oh, the suppliers will come running back once they receive our annual gift. Especially now that the speech will come from the famous Joseph Van Aston this year. Don't remind me about that speech. It's the holidays. Things will turn around. The fate of this company will rely on the success of this gala. More so now than any other year. You think so? I know so. So, she can't have too much of this at once. I can't believe I didn't know that. Well, luckily, donkeys are pretty resilient. The extra alfalfa won't necessarily hurt her. It'll just make her anxious and a little bloated. That's why she's so noisy. It'd be like us eating cupcakes for dinner. We're on in 15 minutes, girl. Think you got another one in you? - Thank you. - Yeah. Never would've known. Liam always said you were a cow whisperer. Guess that applies to donkeys as well. I don't know about that. Is she yours? No. No. I borrow her from a rescue. But she's my responsibility during the holidays. So you put all of this on. Yeah, for the, um, last four years. It's been so great for the community. Gives the shelter folks something to look forward to during the holidays. But... we just lost our funding, so... Looks like this will be the last year. I'm sorry. I know it doesn't look like much, but it takes all year long to set up the catering sponsorships, the food drive. Last year we had the, uh... the third-biggest Christmas tree in San Francisco. I said, "Last year." We got lucky. It didn't fit in one of the Van Aston hotel lobbies. - Joseph hooked us up. - Owen. Hello. - Stick around for the show? - Why not? Just cheer at the end. Otherwise I'm stand... I have to change. I'll be... just one sec... ♪ Born is the king of Israel ♪ So let us keep the spirit of Christmas in our hearts for all the days of our lives. Thank you. Thank you, all. - Really appreciate it. - Yeah. - Thank you for the donation. Thank you. - Yeah. See you next time. Who knew you were quite the actor. Not that good. It was so good to see you again. So good to see you. Uh... Oh. This is Joseph. I should go. Of course. Good to see you. Bring Joseph next time. - Bye. - Bye. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm... I'm so sorry for calling you in here, but I... I kinda need your advice on... - Why do you smell like... - The barn? I was over at Owen's soup kitchen. I was walking, and there was this donkey and... Anyway, it's a long story, but it's a really sweet thing he has going on over there. Wait. So, you're saying you had the entire day in a city, and you still managed to find a cow pen? Donkey pen. Refills. My God, that smell. I'm sorry. I was, uh, over at the soup kitchen. You poor thing. We serve lunch here at 2:00 p.m. each day. Great. Next time, then. Callie and I have been running two successful businesses the past year. Between the dairy farm and the winery, I... I thought she'd have some good ideas. I told you, after the gala, the suppliers... Look, it's not that simple, Victoria. My mother was the face of the company. She dealt with everyone. Without those personal connections, our relationships are dropping like flies. Okay, well, th... then we fix that. I think we need to take advantage of the Christmas spirit and get personal with the suppliers. Bring a little small town to the big city. The main reason my family got by all of those years wasn't because people were obsessed with our baked goods or cheeses. It was because our customers were like family, and they believed in us. I say we give every business partner a verbal Van Aston Enterprises Christmas card, if you will. We'll call every one of them, thank them for their partnership over the years, tell them we can't wait to see them at the annual gala, and wish them a Merry Christmas. I love it. I'm not getting on the phone with every Tom, Dick, and Harry that we do business with. Oh, fine. We'll take it from here. I love you. I know. Your grandmother does the same thing? I love it. I'll have that confirmation sent over shortly. Look, I understand the disappointment, Tim, but believe me, by... by staying with us, you will... Um, you're gonna... By staying with us, you will...

Look, she's gonna call back, and then you can tell her all about your four-wheeler accident. How many marshmallows do you want? Is that even a question? That's all of them. You know, they're really looking forward to this holiday gala. Ugh. Don't remind me. Why not? 'Cause it's... it's the one time a year we have to ask for money. All while showing how much of it you already have. They've got all wrong, don't they? They do. Oh my God. I missed three calls from Hannah. Don't call her now. She's probably sleeping. Like we should be. Hold on. We've earned this. It's this new wine I found from the Ber... Bern... Bernat? Bernet? I... I'm not sure how to say it. It's... it's Ber... Bern... I've heard it's good. Mmm. - Blueberries. - Mm-hmm And chamomile? Yes! Oh, I'm sorry. - That was really, really good. - It's okay. You okay? Oh, yeah. It's... it's not you. It's, um... I'm just a little distracted. Callie's been unreachable the last few days, and, um, I just hope she's okay. Hey. - She's just stressed. - Mmm. Everyone turns into a bridezilla from time to time before their wedding day. This is Callie we're talking about. Exactly. This is Callie we're talking about. She's a big girl. Yeah, right. Okay. Where are you taking me? I thought we were going for a midnight snack. All right. Watch your step. Right. I got you. Whoo. Callie, I want you to meet Susan. Susan, this is Callie. Who's Susan? I named her after my grandmother. Huh? What's with the grand gesture? It's just my way of saying thank you. I mean, you single-handedly helped retain 80% of our suppliers. Mmm. And you look good doing it. Well, you're welcome. And thank you. Thanks to Victoria, I'll be returning home with an entirely new wardrobe. And, uh, speaking of Victoria... ...it's just strange you haven't mentioned her before. Really? That's weird. Cheers. Cheers. Now, we can focus on everything else we have to fix. I thought we fixed everything with all those phone calls. Oh my gosh, no. I mean, yeah, it was... it was huge, but we still have so much more to do. Well, I'm here to help. What do you think of the city so far? I never thought I'd say this, but I love it. Meetings with two-legged mammals instead of four and a new latte from a different café every day of the week. I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to spend some more time here. - It's funny you say that because... - Speaking of the time, we've been so busy. Hmm. No. I haven't signed it yet. You sent it to me yesterday. It's a big decision. I can't make my mind up overnight. Well, I printed out a copy for you just in case. - You haven't told her yet? - No. - What about last night? - Shh. Best one yet. Okay. So, we have the venue. We have the suit. We have the dress. Ugh. Should I have bought that dress? I don't know. I always thought I'd wear my mom's dress on my wedding day. You'd be doing the world a disservice if you didn't wear that gorgeous dress. Your mother will understand. Sometimes, you just have to call an audible. Call an audible? I watch sports. Go Niners. Hello, lovebirds. Leo. I want to personally thank you for the work you put in this week. You're like our perfect little Christmas gift, aren't you? - Hmm. - Thank you. I'm just happy I could help. I told your fiancé to consider offering you an official position once you're all settled in. S... settled in? I've got four gorgeous condominiums to show you, each over 3,000 square feet, killer views, perfect for potentially adding to the family within a year or two. You just let me know when you two cuties are ready to take a look at them. Condominiums? Oh. That might be my fault. I, um, sprang the news on them just yesterday... Okay, what news? Uh... My mother is stepping down from her position at Van Aston Enterprises permanently. The company will officially turn over to my name if I sign the paperwork. I thought you were past hiding things from me. The decision hasn't been made yet. - I was gonna tell you last night... - So tell me now, then. What happens to our life in Petaluma? Oh, I love the life that we've created. But you, more than anyone, should know this is my dad's company. Either I sign the paperwork, or we lose everything that he worked for. You can't keep cutting me out like this. It's like you're trying to get rid of me. - God, no. Callie, we can figure this out... - Figure yourself out. I can't marry two of you. What's that supposed to mean? I need some air. Hey. What did that ever do to you? I don't want it. Nothing's the same. It's okay that things change, Hannah. I mean, if they didn't, then you'd still be wearing diapers. But she didn't even know I got stitches. And now they're out, and she still doesn't care. It's like she forgot about us. And it's the last Sunday before Christmas. This is the day we decorate our tree. She probably forgot about that too. Hey, hey. Your sister's kind of busy planning the wedding of her dreams. She's getting married Christmas Eve. How fun will that be? So let's cut her some slack. Okay? You know what? When she's back, we can punish her and give her all the poopy jobs that she usually gives us, huh? - Okay. - Okay. Let's decorate a Christmas tree so hard that they can see that sucker all the way from San Francisco, huh? Okay? ♪ Christmastime in the colder climes ♪ ♪ The snow is on the ground ♪ ♪ The frost is on the windows ♪ ♪ And the wind blows all around ♪ ♪ The girls are wearing sweaters ♪ ♪ Of holiday reds and greens ♪ ♪ But way out west ♪ ♪ They're getting dressed In bikinis and cutoff jeans ♪ ♪ It's a very merry California Christmas ♪ ♪ We're stringing lights Up in the tall palm trees ♪ ♪ Santa will be riding in... ♪ Come see our Christmas show! All tickets are donation-based. Profits support the homeless in the city. We serve warm meals all season long. It's so crowded today. Most people who come on weekends have jobs. Unless you make a fortune, the city will swallow you up. Especially if you got a family to feed. So hard to believe. I mean, it seems like money grows on trees in this city. Only for those rich enough to plant them in the first place. Like the Van Astons. Oh, yeah. Speaking of, I was surprised Joseph didn't keep up the donations, especially after knowing you and I grew up together. The Van Astons pay for this soup kitchen? Yeah. You... you didn't know? No. - The company is struggling and... - Oh, don't feel like you need to explain. We're... we are lucky to have had their support for as long as we did. Hey, Ainsley. You wanna help out for a bit before the show? Um, no. Ainsley, this is Callie, my friend from home. Uh, we hired Ainsley to be our Mother Mary this year. Yeah, about that. I can't make it tonight. I booked a job, so... We're on in 20 minutes. Not my problem. Who can I possibly find to play Mother Mary in the next 20 minutes? I forgot my phone. Oh. Good luck. You sure this is okay? 'Cause we have two performances. You'll be here all day... I got... I gotta change. What's with the outfit? I thought you needed an excuse. Here you go. Probably more than you'll make all month. You're welcome. Whatever. All bringing forth what would soon be known as the most precious gift the world would ever receive. The God of the universe came to us in the form of a tiny, lowly baby. So let us keep the spirit of Christmas in our hearts for all the days of our lives. ♪ ...of Israel ♪ Thank you. Thank you all! That's it for now. Stick around for the next show, if you'd like. Pet Hopey. She's very, very nice. Hey, friends. You've reached Callie Bernet. Please leave a message. You killed it today. You're a natural Virgin. Oh. Please never say that again. Well, I may be selfish, but I'd love to have you in the city. I missed you. It really does feel like yesterday. You and Liam begging me to drive you to the movies. Life was so simple back then. You don't remember, do you? Remember what? How you and Liam used to fight like dogs over your futures. He wanted you to follow him to UC Davis. You wouldn't have that. You had to go to St. Louis to study social economics and agriculture like your dad. I swear you two had a different plan every week. And then we never even got the chance to choose one. You would've worked it out 'cause you loved each other. Yeah. Relationships are all about compromise. You can't force Joseph to stay away from the city any more than he can force you to walk away from the farm. You and Joseph will work it out. Where you headed? Um, j... just back to the hotel. It's a block away. I can walk. Nonsense. Vanilla chai, right? Thank you. Tell me, how are you feeling about everything, dear? I'm just a little tired of it all, to be honest. Oh, honey. If you're tired now, wait until you're a few days out from the big day. You won't sleep a wink. I was awake for a full 36 hours before my wedding. How long have you been married? The wedding never happened. We called it off. More like he called it off. I'm sorry to hear that. I have to say it looks much better on your hand than it did on mine. I always thought my hands were a little too long for an emerald cut. Looks better on thicker hands. You see how the shape elongates the wrist in a way? No offense, of... of course. It's beyond gorgeous. Oh, he didn't tell you we were engaged? Oh my. It seems I'm always revealing too much too soon. - Callie, what are you doing? - Owen's soup kitchen lost all its funding. That's what this is about? Cal, we had to make cuts to keep the lights on. I told him we'd try to pick it up after the gala if the suppliers reconfirmed, but... The company can afford to put on a gala that costs more than what most people make in a year, and you're telling me you can't afford to help people who would give anything for a hot meal during the holidays? The wedding venue, how much does that cost? You know, we could get married at the winery for free. That's what I pictured for us. You and me, a few special guests, my family's land. But you wouldn't know that, would you? Because you never asked me. Callie... And I don't understand how you can stand there and continue to keep secrets from me after everything we've been through. If you wanted to give me a secondhand ring, you could have asked me for Liam's. It's cut better for my fat fingers, according to Victoria. Victoria? What are you talking about... I'm glad we came here to realize that you belong in this city, Joseph. I don't. All right. All right. Spit it out. - The wine? - No! Not the wine! No. Y... you said you wanted to walk and talk, and so we walked and talked all the way up here. My calves hurt, and I know that you got more on your mind. You don't have to be afraid because I'm... ...falling in love with you. - What? - What? I'm... falling in love with you. - Oh, wow, uh... - I'm sorry. No. I just wasn't expecting... - No, I get it. That's... that's fine. - That's why I was gonna... - Wow. Um... - Sorry. Uh... I think I'm falling for you too. I mean, I am. I'm falling in love with you. For real? - Mm-hmm. - You are? I am. Okay, just... Okay. You do so much for Callie and her family and this land. I just... I wanna know what you want. Where do you see yourself in, like, five, ten years? Joseph? Joseph! Well, you got what you wanted. What are you talking about? You drove her away because you're still not over that you and I didn't work out. Oh, Joseph, tell me you're not blaming me for your lack of honesty. You know how much she means to me. I didn't do anything wrong. You only have yourself to blame. Besides, seems like you both dodged a bit of a bullet. What? I should probably cancel the venue. Picture's in your email. - Do you wanna talk about it now or later? - Nope! You know, I was right. I kept him on the farm all year long to avoid the inevitable. And... and a recycled ring from an ex-fiancée I knew nothing about? - God! - Maybe there's more to this story. It doesn't matter. For him to even consider that I'd uproot my life and leave everything behind? What is that face? Wasn't that what he did for you this past year? No! Yes! But it's not the same thing. Okay. Well, at least the farm is still standing, huh? We didn't burn it down. How's Manny? He's good! So good. I know I royally messed up. - Again. - Again. But Owen and Callie? It just doesn't seem right. It's... it's her dead fiancé's brother. Like, what? Things aren't always what they seem. Let the dust settle. Call her in a few days. You've got the gala tomorrow night. Focus on that. She'll come around before the wedding. What wedding? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me. I'll take that. - Do you still have the paperwork? - Of course. With Callie and I up in the air, my dad's legacy is all I have. And I have a feeling that she's not coming back. I think you're right. From what she's posting on social media, she's on island. Ugh. What is wrong with you? I was talking about Callie! But thank you. I can't unsee that. Sorry. What is it you really want? I wanna marry Callie. She wants to marry you too. She just can't marry two of me. Well, who's the real you? Here we go. Good luck. - Han? - Not hungry. Okay. I saw the tree! You guys did a great job. How'd you get so many lights to fit? Manny helped because you weren't here. I got stitches. I heard you were the best stitches patient that doctor had ever seen. - I didn't cry. - I don't doubt it. Where's Joseph? Uh, he's... he's not back yet. Oh boy. Allow me, madame. - Thank you. - Mmm. Hannah's not joining us? Not until Joseph shows up. Oh. Mmm. - What? - Tell her. Tell her what? You want me... No. I'm not gonna tell her. - Tell her. - I'm not gonna tell her tonight. It's... What is going on between you two? Okay. Last week, I saw her do something with her lips, and I knew... I knew at that moment that she wanted the goods! Okay. Hold... Wait! Hold on. What? You guys are... You guys... When I was gone. Am I getting this right? Mm-hmm. Wow. I mean, I'm so happy for you guys! Thank you. Jeez, what else happened when I was gone? - No! Hmm? - What? No way. This is delicious. Thank you! So good. - It's so good. - Mm-hmm. - And you're not gonna tell her? - I'm not. No. - Can I tell her? - Mm-mm. All right! Everything okay? Okay. Ten years ago, when I moved to California, I had very few goals. Um, I thought I'd find a place to stay for free and make enough money to buy some video games... ...but what I hadn't realized until I started working here was I was searching for a family all along. I, uh... I've been on my own for a while now, and, uh, this is the first time in my life that I've ever felt like I belong somewhere. You, Hannah, this land. You're my family. And, uh, I love you guys. I would do anything for you all. Okay, I have cried enough in the past 24 hours. - If you don't stop... - Okay. I... I'll... I'll cut to the chase. Um... I plan on building a family of my own one day. Give them the same joy and support and acceptance that you've given me, but I can't do that unless I have a piece of land to call my own. I've, um... I've reworked some of the numbers here, and Manny can continue working here as is, but instead of being paid in full each month, 15% can go towards purchasing a 12-acre plot out of your 200. In five years, he can have ownership of the land for a fair price. And there's this tree that gives this bomb-ass midafternoon shade that I think would be really... - Yes! - What? I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner. Really? You'll sell me some of your land? Merry Christmas. - Yay! - Thank you. This is awesome! Manny, is everything okay? - Is Callie there? - She is! Can I talk to her? He wants to know... You know what? I actually think she's busy. But listen, there's a lot I gotta tell you, okay? I was thinking about my future, and I talked to Callie, and she'll let me buy some of the land. Isn't that great? I mean, it's perfect! There's this great spot... Oh, I'm sorry, baby. I really should have paid to have it stored properly. It's so beautiful. Hmm. You're beautiful. Well, what do you think? I don't know! - Go try it on! - Can I try it on? - Yes! - Okay. Oh my gosh! Oh, honey, it's stunning. - I really like it. - You do? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. I just... I hope for a marriage as good as you and Dad. Have I ever told you the story of the invisible backpack? - No. - No. Well, see, when we're born, we all come with this invisible backpack, you know, to put your experiences and... and your memories in. You know, for some people, well, that backpack just weighs a few pounds. Gosh, you hardly even notice it's there. But for others, it can feel like the weight of the world just sits on their shoulders. And sometimes, you don't find out what's in your partner's backpack until you are well into a marriage. That's okay. We all have baggage, you know? Parts of ourselves we'd rather keep hidden and tucked away even from those we love the most. You have to accept what's in your partner's backpack before its contents are revealed... or else you'll have a very long and rocky road ahead of you. You have to carry each other's burdens. But, Mama, I think I know everything there is to know about Liam. I... I know you do, baby, but there may come a day when you see something in him that he was afraid to show you. But hey, you know his heart. Right? - Mm-hmm. - Forgiveness is a superpower! - "Seventy times seven." - Yeah. - I love you. - I love you too. Hey. - Hey! - I'm sorry. Oh. No, hon, I'm sorry, okay? I got so overwhelmed and busy. I should have checked in with you more. Are you and Joseph still getting married? Hey. You and me are a team. Okay? Mm. I promise to never be too busy for my little sister ever again. Okay? - Okay. - Do you forgive me? - Yeah. - Let me see that cool scar! Ouch. Did it hurt? Oh. Keep your head up. Love you, kid. Hey. Hey, man! Hi. You have something you want to say to me? Oh. Don't sweat it. You know, Callie said you guys have been struggling a bit. Things happen. Things happen? Yeah, things happen in every relationship. That doesn't mean you can move in whenev... Move in on... What are you talking about, man? I'm talking about you and Callie. Who else would I be talking about? I... I'm talking about the soup kitchen. Callie and I are just friends. She and my brother were high school sweethearts before he died. I... I would never go there with her. Yeah? Then how do you explain this? Someone must've taken that during the last performance. Look, same costume. Performance? My Mother Mary walked out on me for a day, so Callie filled in for her. She didn't... she didn't tell you? No, no. I think she forgot to mention it. - I owe her one. - Mm-hmm. See, these kids spend all day on the bus just to come to watch the live show, see the donkey. You know what? Uh, don't pack up too much. I think we can make budget cuts somewhere else. Thank you. Thank you, man. S... S... stick around for the show! Mom? Listen. I'm gonna cut to the chase because the service here is awful! Victoria said the wedding's off. What happened? Look, I... I thought we could do it all. But you should have seen her. I mean, she was single-handedly closing suppliers we never would've locked in. That doesn't surprise me. And I completely ruined it. Neither does that. How could you leave me with this decision? Because I knew you'd make the right one! How? Before your father started the business, it was an idea in our one-bedroom apartment. Even though the money came along, it was never about that. If your father were here, he'd tell you he didn't work a day in his life. When your father died, I... I got lost in it all. I... The city, the money. You and Callie showed me what it was like to follow my heart. It led me here! I'll never be able to thank you enough. So, where does that leave me? Make it right, Joseph. You did it once. You can do it again. Hi, Mom. God, I miss you. This isn't easy. "Seventy times seven"? Seems like one too many mistakes. But you were right. I know his heart. I love him. I would forgive him 1,000 more times if I had to. Am I crazy? I wish you could be here. The God of the universe came to us in the form of a tiny, lowly baby. Not with red carpets, limousines, paparazzi, and press releases, but silently, in the quiet of the night. This time of year, we... we tend to look out at the hustle and bustle of the world's busy lives, and for once, we become more interested in people than in things. The best things in life aren't things at all. So, let us keep the spirit of Christmas in our hearts. Whoo! Well, this is as good as it gets without Victoria's fancy wardrobe. Hey, you're perfect! Who needs designer brands when you got a body like that? Let's do this. Let's. Thank you. Joseph, you can't do this! - I can, and I already did. - But this is suicide! What do I tell the board members? The guests arrive in 20 minutes, Joseph. I don't know. Uh, have them stay at one of our hotels for the weekend. Or better yet, have them turn their private jets around so they can go home for the holidays. Too late. Harry. Gentlemen, believe me, I will take care of everything. Joseph doesn't realize the importance of this evening. Merry Christmas, Harry. How's the wife, kids? They're fine. How old is your youngest? Is he... He was nine? Ten? Eight. Uh, where are you going with this, Joseph? We have no time. I saw a kid today. He didn't have shoes on, and he was about your son's age. Yeah, he took four buses to get a hot cup of soup. Barefoot. Now, in here we are about to assemble millions of dollars, and honestly, for what? When my dad offered you the CFO position, why'd you take the job? My family. The kids. Yet here you are, away from your family, just days before Christmas, and you're focused on work. The Bernet Farms taught me that simple can be better. That having less can sometimes mean having more. I'm stepping in as acting CEO of Van Aston Enterprises effective immediately. There will be a shift in the company, from caring solely about the shareholders to also caring about the community. And you might not like to hear this, but 10% of our annual profits will go to multiple charities around the city. What profits? I consider all of you family. I do. And I hope this doesn't change our working relationship. But if it does... maybe that's okay. Oh, and if you're hungry, I hear the soup kitchen next door has quite the spread. I could eat. That was quite the speech back there. I meant every word. And I know an apology can't change the fact that I kept something from you for so long. I forgive you. That's it? That's it. That speech back there? That is the Joseph I've known for the last year, and that is the Joseph that I would like to marry. You still wanna marry me? 'Cause I... I'll do anything. I will. I... I don't need the city. I know that now. I just... I'm not gonna make you give up your life here. We'll figure something out. And besides, you've got a lot of work to do. Multiple charities? You can't do that all from Petaluma, can you? - And about the wedding... - Yeah, about that. We lost the venue. Oh. I have another idea. Hmm? Oh. Uh, Victoria, can I talk to you for a second? You know I think fondly of our years together. You are hardworking and ambitious. You're exactly the kind of person that people expected Joseph Van Aston to marry. I know it's... it's long overdue, but... I'm really sorry, and I hope you'll forgive me. What was your excuse again? "Marriage just isn't for me, V." I always thought I'd be the one who tamed the lion. Watching Callie parade around with that rock on her finger was just... Oh, the rock that you said once was on your finger? - Joseph... - I'm not trying to fight. If I remember right, you kept the ring that I gave you. Turned it into a beautiful pair of half diamond studs. Let's see if they fit! Why now? After so many years? Well, I guess I'm starting to realize that holding things in, it can really hurt somebody. Yeah? Merry Christmas! Maybe you have changed, Joseph. I'm trying to prove it. To you, to... to everyone. - Joseph, that photo was... - I know. It's okay. All right. Have fun tonight. Okay?
