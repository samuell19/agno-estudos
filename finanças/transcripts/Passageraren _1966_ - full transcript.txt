There is an image with birds; eagles; and a storm is gathering, and lightning strikes the peak. Everyone suggested he should go away, to unwind. The Wind: He opened Simon's book to page seven; "A collection of brief glimpses, partially perceived by the eye; words, partially apprehended by the ear; feelings, partially obscured, and all of it blurred, full of gaps which the imagination and an approximate logic attempted to complete with randomized inferences, randomized but not necessarily false, because either everything is random, in which case it still contains a story, or more precisely: it contains countless adaptations, consisting of countless aspects in continual transformation because that is how it appears, has appeared, and will continue to appear to all those who have experienced it, suffered by it, endured it, or enjoyed it, or alternatively, reality may contain its own inexpugnable life, independent of our senses and thereby also independent of our knowledge, and above all our need for logic. And if so, any attempt to close in on it, find it, and seize it, may be equally futile and disappointing as disassembling those Central European toys consisting of ever smaller wooden dolls embedded in each other where one finally reaches something infinitely small and insignificant, simply nothing. And to, at this point, when all has passed, attempt to reconstruct and tell everything as it happened is similar to melding the scattered and incomplete shards from a shattered mirror. We arrive at a detached, laughable, and foolish conclusion, where nothing besides our train of thought, or more precisely our arrogance, compels us to, at all costs, and contrary to all evidence, conceive a rational causal link, or else we would go mad, while our senses are limited, to perceive only how this aimless wandering, where we hurl once to the right, once to the left, like corks drifting drunkenly, without seeing, aiming only to keep their heads above the surface, and there we suffer until we finally die, and that is all." He followed their advice, went away; it was now uncertain if he, or more precisely the boat, was getting closer or further away since the birds were changing their positioning only on one axis, which was, or at least appeared to be, perpendicular to the vessel's longitudinal direction. The raindrops beat down on his face, which could mean that he is facing the boat's prow, or the wind is moving faster than the boat, provided that it is moving forward, which is not certain, since the ferry regularly moves with its stern ahead when closing in on Fredrikshavn and preparing for docking. And now we are listening to a German sea shanty. "We are back on the merry sea." "Somewhere, on the wide ocean, my vigil is over." If the wind was blowing in the same direction as the car was moving, and the car was moving at a slower pace than the wind, which of course is very rare, it would still be necessary to switch on the windscreen wipers, since the rain's vertical movement... is independent of the car's or the wind's horizontal movement. The road's margin is dyed white diagonally in relation to the right-side window's chrome-plated frame. First, waiting for the adequate moment for the drive by, second, provided it is raining or has recently rained, a cloud of dirty rain drops is tossed onto this car's windscreen by the car or truck in front, turning the screen is almost completely opaque. until it is wiped off during the fraction of a second, and third, the vessel's own acceleration. He established that he, as a passenger, couldn't in any way influence how the drive by was carried through. The door handle reflects a miniature and unrecognizably distorted virtual copy of the surroundings. To the right, a mound of dirt or sand, to the left, IJsselmeer, to the right on the other side of the mound is, this he knows, the North Sea, and the car is riding across the Afsluitdijk in the Netherlands and now he has arrived in Paris and we are listening to a bal-musette. The Eiffel Tower passes by, seemingly from left to right through the right-side window, while the car is driving forward. The tower may appear to shift from right to left, in relation to the light pole in the foreground, but only if the car is moving in an arc around the pole, for example at Place de la Concorde when the car follows the rush over the bridge towards Palais Bourbon. Now he has seen The National Embassy and straight across Palais Bourbon at the other side of the bridge, at Place de la Concorde, lies a church which reminds him of a temple, or more precisely, an architectural order which brings to mind the pictures of Greek buildings he has seen occasionally on postcards sent to him during the past few years by colleagues sightseeing in Greece. The church is called L'église de la Madeleine. It has been said that most buildings in Paris are black or dark grey, soiled by air pollution, while Sacré-Cœur remains white, due to the specific properties of the stone used to build the church. He wonders if the church's location on top of Montmartre wouldn't be more decisive as a determinant. He didn't stay in Paris, he followed their advice, went further away. Now he might be in Bagnères-de-Bigorre, a small town 550 meters above sea level at the base of the Pyrenees. Behind gates, there are pavilions built around the turn of the century: black slate roofs, oculi, and balconies with wooden balustrades. Birds, eagles, and poultry live among plasterwork and Oriental bronze figurines, beds with wooden baldachins and moist mattresses, one may suppose, since there is no central heating installed in houses, or more precisely summer pavilions, inhabited only a few months a year by people from Paris or the industrial city Saint-Étienne. Ornaments, vases, and pedestals. Behind gates, there is a park with a pond, a fountain, some exotic trees: Lebanese cedars and Chilean pines, and behind closed shutters and drawn blinds, little women in starched dresses practising the piano next to family photographs, chalcography, and climbers. There is a hot spring, the water contains certain sulphur compounds. and it is therefore regarded to be a suitable drink in the morning while curing conditions in the lower abdomen. Ornaments, vases, and pedestals and the bathhouse, which is white with plenty of small windows by the middle. A park with plane trees, poplars, and plasterwork. Or is it marble? Moss is growing around the mouth and eyes, due to the high and consistent humidity. A gazebo and we were listening to some old-fashioned music. Arriving to Bagnères-de-Bigorre are the ill and those who are, or believe themselves to be, in need of a change of scenery. Immutable contours, erratic though almost indiscernible spasms which he is unable to interpret, sudden head movements distinctive to some animal species, such as birds and insects, as well as people who have been lonesome for a long time. The water sprinkles behind the foliage and balustrade, creating a cloud of atomized droplets, in which the sun's rays, under certain conditions, break. If you are standing at the right distance from the curtain of droplets, you may discern a tiny rainbow. A Japanese drawing on silk finish paper where the relation between objects is defined by shades of grey, which is to say, the most distant object, in this particular case the highest mountain peaks, are drawn with thin and faint lines, whereas the fruit trees in the foreground. are drawn most accurately and with darker lines. He would follow their advice, leave Bagnères-de-Bigorre, and all other cities, and head up the mountains, and he therefore finds himself at the tourist office and the man behind the counter wears a white shirt, answers the phone, and is a labourer within the tourist industry where he is selling and sometimes realising trips, and other pursuits for ladies in light dresses leafing through the brochures. The lady shall turn right and continue straight, and she will arrive at the highest mountain, the deepest tarn, the largest cavern, the finest restaurant, the most beautiful view, the highest waterfall. There are birds, even eagles, and a storm is gathering and lightning strikes the peak. Keukenhof, New York, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, and a picture of the bus. A Dutch priest will also join, possibly leading a group of children. Andorra and tomorrow Spain, Biarritz, Hendaye, Andorra, San Sébastien, Cap de Long, Lac d'Orédon, Val d'Aran, Pic du Midi. The bus sets off for Gavarnie, through the Tourmalet mountain pass, at 9am, Wednesday. A roof made out of shiny, corrugated galvanised iron, he supposes it to be corrugated galvanised iron, incidentally reflects the sunlight. A derelict house with a collapsed roof, and in front of the church, or more precisely on a ridge which partly obscures the church behind it, a woman is collecting dried grass with a wooden rake, and a man heaves a hay bale onto his head, and farmyards, fields, rows of trees, and trenches are creating a pattern. Folk music. A battlement, telephone wire insulators made of porcelain or glass, bodies of water being led down from the heights to the power plant through thick pipelines, but when the energy consumption is at its lowest, which is to say when some terminals are producing an excess of electrical current, the turbines at other terminals will be operated in the opposite direction in order to pump the water back uphill through the same pipelines, using an arch system, to refill the tarns, and thereby creating a temporary hydropower storage, which may be used when the energy consumption is at its highest. Power lines and telephone wires may not be mixed up: telephone wires criss-cross in between the posts, twisting through the air in order to avoid cross-talk through induction. There is an observatory and a radio tower on top of Pic du Midi. "Here is La Mongie at an altitude of 1800 metres." "It is the largest ski resort in the Pyrenees." "Straight across is the cable car to the peak of Taoulet." Three men walk on a profiled beam made of iron, they are probably construction workers because La Mongie is a rather new ski resort which is not yet completed. Black and white fields, power lines with insulators made of glass, letters, rectangles and squares, restaurants, parasols, wooden balustrades, stairs, night clubs, modules, cranes, and hair salons at an altitude of 1800 metres above mean sea level. Below the beam is a lake, how far below is difficult to estimate due to the lack of references. I always have to think of Madagascar Madagascar never forgets itself "We were off Madagascar, And had the plague on board, The water was rotting in the buckets, And some went overboard! Ahoy! Ahoy, comrades! Ahoy, Ahoy, Ahoy!" The bus has stopped at the highest point of the Tourmalet mountain pass. Motorcycle handlebar and iron chairs and a speaker, presumably hooked up to a record player or a tape recorder. And the people are cold, covering their heads with transparent plastic cowls, running and walking and opening and shutting the car doors. Entire families wandering around, disappointed, in and out of cars with their headlights on, and the windscreen wipers once again getting some use and umbrellas which were randomly stowed with the rest of the luggage, and unfolded collars. He himself is also cold and he smokes a cigarette and spots a sign, or more precisely, a panoramic map, which in a simplifying way... details the names and heights of the surrounding mountains, with numbers he cannot verify. And a boy looks through a pair of panoramic binoculars, although he sees nothing, since he has forgotten to put in a coin to activate the aperture mechanism. And another boy looks through a monocular and is dressed like a cook, since there is a restaurant in the area. A small lamp is flashing to alert the drivers. A shepherd with his dog, it has to be a shepherd with his dog, or maybe it is an expert in rock blasting, since a new cable car is being built between Tourmalet and Pic du Midi. 751 metres further up, heavy trucks are carrying away the blasted boulders. "The weather is terrible today. You can't see anything." Dynamite blasts, or possibly thunder, behind the fog, obscured by the fog, are birds, eagles; a storm is gathering and lightning strikes the peak. Water droplets, dewdrops, in front of some rapids, it may have rained the night before. or maybe the fog is liquifying on the blades of grass and the leaves. He is now too close to the water droplet and a storm is gathering, but he is aware that he must go on, unwind, and he followed, went to a building with a store to buy souvenirs: photographs, postcards with the panoramic view from the mountain pass of Tourmalet or Pic du Midi, or the highest peak of the Pyrenees, cowbells, egg cups, baskets, and tiny cylinders made of cardboard and plastic, decorated with painted cows, and which, when you turned them upside-down, let out the sound of a cow, while it was being drained of air, and from the ceilings hang different kinds of horns, which you could buy and blow, and he bought and sent a card to all his friends, so that they too, if they too would pass through here one day, would recognise the mountain passes of Tourmalet, Great St. Bernard, or Bernina, with the same kind of happiness he experienced when he recognised the facade of the Madeleine Church in Paris, although he had never seen it before, except on postcards from friends who had travelled through Greece. "There are so many men all over the world, there are so many, there are so many, ..." The people are already tired, maybe because of the healthy air, or they are affected by the heat or the bus's slight rockings: erratic, almost indiscernible muscle twitches, uncontrollable, almost automatic movements. "Here is the village Gavarnie, at an altitude of 1300 metres." The doors are being opened and closed, he can sit on chairs made of steel and plastic, eating sandwiches with cheese, liver pâté, and cold bacon, next to an aquarium with anxious trout, and the music becomes something entirely different. Parasols protect against the heat from the sun rays, constantly shifting light spots tire the eyes, and cow bells agitated by the wind and voices and donkeys and horses and laughter and doors which are being opened or closed and parasols and hanging or stacked straw hats, just like they are beside the soft drink sellers in Cannes or Nice or Ostend, where the wind worries, and one is, like here, able to rent horses for brief walks along the beach while older ladies remain in the shades of the parasols, to calmly drink slightly carbonated soft drinks. The laundry is suspended in front of some old cars, and he spots the valley of Gavarnie behind the cars, with a vertical mountain face as its background and a waterfall which is considered to be notable. The road to the waterfall is long and pebbly; why, there are donkeys and mules for rent, and the women are covering their heads with plastic cowls and concealing their thighs with woollen cardigans when they straddle on the donkeys' backs, and she reminds him of an aunt who used to visit his parents' home and which he always viewed from below, when he played on the Afghan rug without understanding why everyone had laughed when she straddled in the plush sofa, just like she does now on the donkey's back. He followed their advice and he now walks toward the waterfall, just like everyone else, past the child who plays behind the traffic sign. The hat protects against the hot sun rays, small children must be carried and a lady without incisors is pushed up the pebbly road, and on there is a restaurant on the other side of the stream, and in front of or behind the restaurant, there are parasols. A man with a white cane walks arm in arm with a lady in a black dress and hat, and next to another lady. The donkey is loaded with hay and is being led in front of the parasols. The water is most likely cold, even though it is August, because it is from the glacier approximately five kilometres away. The invalid carriage had been parked in the shadow by the lady who has pushed it this far and is now sitting next to the wall, resting her legs just like three other persons, two men and a woman, who is seemingly also tired, although they have walked merely half of the way to the waterfall which was probably intended as the destination of the stroll, they will now be content with seeing the waterfall at a distance and take pictures from here, but he must go on. Below the mountain is a vending machine with soft drinks and food. "- Push yourself back. I'll help you. There? Just follow the animal's movements." No one gets further than this on the donkey's back. Everyone, constantly moving, and voices and donkeys and horses and laughter, which he cannot interpret or anticipate or influence, like birds or insects increasingly smaller now that he is moving away from it. He must walk to the waterfall on foot. A brook is pouring below the snow, which is to say, the snow is creating a bridge. A lot of people, the exact amount is difficult to estimate, have walked all the way to the snow bridge to cut loose blocks of snow, using their canes, which they will then throw away, or carry around, or push toward a girl's head, or put in a plastic bag, or raise in front of the amateur photographer's still video cameras, with hopes of getting their pictures taken. Sometimes they are positioned in backlight, making it difficult for the photographer to avoid certain elements of the lens, and attempts to work around it by asking another person to hold up a jacket between the sun and the camera, while two girls, supposedly twins, judging by their similar dresses, are laughing, because they have gotten snow in their shoes, without noticing a woman older than them and is having difficulty walking and then falls on the slippery ground, since the snow is densely packed. The road ends here. and people turn around and backtrack to the bus which is waiting for them, He keeps going, further away, he estimates the distance to a kilometre, the waterfall thunders. And then suddenly he is too close; he should have stopped where the road ended, where people stopped, took pictures to remember it by, and turned around, because now he has gone too close: the cricket, the water droplet, chaos; he is now aware that everyone has tricked him: there was supposed to be birds, eagles; a storm should gather and lightning should strike the peak, but the water only falls from a height of 400 metres and creates a cloud of water particles at the base, which obscures the view and could create a rainbow, would the sun's rays would reach it, which he doubts they ever would, since the waterfall is still situated in the shadow at 12pm during a day in August: simply nothing; and to, at this point, when all has passed, attempt to reconstruct and tell everything as it happened... is similar to melding the scattered and incomplete shards from a shattered mirror. We arrive at a detached, laughable, and foolish conclusion, where nothing besides our train of thought, or more precisely our arrogance, compels us to, at all costs, and contrary to all evidence, conceive a rational causal link, or else we would go mad, while our senses are limited, to perceive only how this aimless wandering, where we hurl once to the right, once to the left, like corks drifting drunkenly, without seeing, aiming only to keep their heads above the surface, and there we suffer until we finally die, and that is all. subtitles by silkespojken & karawitan
