May 1 , 1956 STARRlNG: My grandmother keeps watch over an air-raid siren every public holidays. She's sitting on the roof-top reading ''Pelle the Conqueror''. Pull it! l can't. Why not? Only in case of danger or attack. Who would attack? The enemy. Who's that? Those who dropped the atomic bomb. The imperialists. The Americans? Yes, for instance. They won't come. You could pull it, - once, so l can hear it! - No. WHOOPlNG COUGH Everybody went mad this morning. l'll pee whenever l feel like it. This is my sister, Annamari. She's got the family on a string. Silence! That's father. He's glued to his radio. Franciska! We know everything in advance. She's going to threaten mother. - Mother, you're driving me mad. - How edgy you are these days... And these are my friends: ?rs and Paja. They never want to play ping-pong with me. Listen! Come here! Stop it! ldiots! You'll be late for school. School?! Are you joking? Attention. Here's an important announcement. The Minister of the lnterior of the Hungarian People's Republic imposed a curfew from 6 pm. on October 24, till am. on Oct. 25. During the curfew the doors of all buildings have to be kept locked. Come up at once! You aren't going anywhere. lt's a civil war, mummy. Where? What do you mean where? Outside. - Till evening. - What? By supper there will be order. An who'll make order? Are you frightened? - And so you are. And you've every reason to be. - ldiot. Well, before, l don't say... But now? You're unpopular. Feri, You can't speak like this to my mother. Where? There are people who hate you. Who? Stop it, Feri, for heaven's sake! - No, let him! - All right... At last he's frank. Have l ever cheated, stolen or lied? Something is happening at last. Some uprising at last. The longer it lasts the better. lf there's an uprising, there's no school. What are you mixed up in? Where have you been? Who were you with? Why don't you say something? And we have a maid, Szidi. She's got a boyfriend. He always sneaks in. You can hardly hear him saying hello. He's a cowardy rabbit. That's why we call him ''Szidi's bunny''. Do you see this? What do you want it for? l've got a pistol. lt's mine. We won. Shut up and go to hell! lt isn't even loaded. Just a moment. l only want to kiss. You're so stupid. You're out. That doesn't count. That's not fair. l slipped. - Once again? - Let him. OK. Throw it. Serving there. There you are. You do it on purpose. You two play the whole day. l couldn't get the key out. My hands are full. Here. What's up? Did you go to the office? - Give it to me. lt's pecking. - lt isn't. lt isn't. Can't you keep out of my way? Szidi, don't shout at the children! The whole country is shouting, madam. Take it out into the yard. Mother isn't back yet. What's the matter with you? Are you drunk? Franciska! l punched B?la Tak?cs. l punched a man. Well.. l'm able to punch someone. Well, l can if l must. My hand just slipped. Szidi, dear, you mustn't be so touchy. l'm going to write to my brother immediately, and l ask him to meet me at the station. You can't be serious, Szidi. - But l am. - Szidi! And the children? B?la got a facer. My husband's gone mad. My mother's gone mad too. At least the two of us shouldn't lose our heads. l'll punch the whole country if need be! We ought to go down to the shop and buy sugar, lard and flour. - Thanks God. - What are you doing here? You could've phoned. You're joking. Good. More books please. Come on. l wasin the office. Chaos everywhere. The secretary is sitting by the radio. Everyone's hissing. l said to them: you get the wind up quickly enough. One of these assets gets up and tells me: Go into hiding! Disappear! - You see? - And that l mustn't budge from home. l gave them a piece of my mind. l'm not in the menopause yet. - What's this got to do with it? - l went to see the siren but the building was locked. l rang teh bell, l hammered the door. The concierge poked his nose out, but people have gone mad. He didn't recognize me. Yet l have to watch over the sirene. - Mummy, can't you stay put? - Stay put? My foot. What are you doing there? Aren't you ashamed yourself? ln your position... What's my position? l'm no longer a director. l say! So what! Be proud! l don't want to interfere but don't accept a lower post. Come down, l'll go up. lt doesn't matter. ln a couple of days you'll realise. Whether one's a director or not, makes no difference. Don't pity me! Understand? l don't want my mother-in-law pitying me. l can pity myself very well. - The point is... let me tell you... - What? What? Say the word. You are... lf anyone asks you should tell we haven't any sugar. We haven't. All right? Look into his eyes and say: no. Now he's turning the poor kids' heads. What is this? Three holes. lt's been shot at. lt was baked in the bread. Good Lord, mother! You're out of your mind! - You might have been shot. - But l wasn't. l'm bullet-proof. Tomi! Don't stand barefoot on the tiles. What are you reading? But this is in German and Latin. You don't even understand it. But l do. You stand here at night measuring your thing? Only for the last three nights. Come here. Sit down. Come. lt won't grow bigger from Monday to Wednesday. - lt did. - Well, that's all right then. How big should it be? Like in the book. Did anybody tease you? These are stupid things. They happen to everybody of your age. When l was a little girl l kept measuring my breasts. l used to stand in front of the mirror all day long. And they grew. Look here. - Did they grow? - They did. Yes. Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! The American relatives. Hello, yes, we are speaking here. Hello, my Giza! No everything's all right. Your radio is lying. lt's lying. l'll explain. Rose, carnation, saffron! Flowers. Have you never seen flowers? Why don't you understand? Tell me! Giza! lt's me, your mother. Leave me alone. l'm glad to hear your voice. What? l'll tell you differently. We don't usually have storms here, but now there's a big storm. Yes, a big one. Rain, thunder, lightning. What? No, no, no. Feri doesn't go out in the storm. He's inside. He's in the flat. Hello, my Giza. Franciska speaking. l'll put it differently. There's a big epidemic here. A big one. No, children don't catch it. Listen to me, my daughter! The children are not allowed to go out in the rain. Yes. We are all in the flat. Give it to me! Listen to me, Giza, l'll put it differently. lt's autumn and there's a thick fog. Listen to me, my daughter! Noone is going out in the rain. We're talking shelter under the eaves. - You don't let me finish... - Listen, Giza! l'll put it differently. - We're making it warm for them. - Good Lord, Feri! We've got raincoats. Nylon! - Now speak loud! - What should l say? - We're all right. Hello. l'd like to say that... l'll put differently. Say the word 33. Then lick my arse and let me be. What are you doing? At times like this there's no sense in being formal. - Hello, my friend. - Hello. Ferenc, l learned how to escape. So if they break them all down, we can still jump out here. The pounding can be heard in your flat, then you give the signal. They always round up the men. This is the first thing. Let's have a rehearsal. Yes. Alarm! Hell! - Hell! - Oh, no! Boys, there's a problem. l'll give you a hand. Wait, sir, l'll give you a hand. - All right, but we are friends. - Of course.. Damn it! l used to be a gymnast. Not there, it hurts. - Uhh... - Slowly! Mummy, prepare a compress for the director, Feri! What are you looking for? One can't find anything in this bloody pigstye. - Where's the typewriter? - Must you have it now, at dawn? Yes. Right now. Stop ''right nowing''! We'll look for it in the morning. l suppose the children were playing with it. But i've just thought of something. Be quiet, you'll wake the children. - Where's the typewriter? - Why do you want it for? T write a letter. - Right now? - That's all she can say too. Shall l explain it to you? l haven't slept a wink all night. - Then go to bed. - No. l write a letter to Hrushchev and Eisenhower. That's all we need. You know... You wrote to R?kosi too. lt's a wonder the whole family wasn't arrested. Try to understand, these people mould world politics but they don't notice that in the middle of Europe a little country has come to the fore. Where's the typewriter? Write by hand. No. l'll dictate. Find the typewriter and insert a paper. With a carbon. There will be two letters. Or three? Tomi! What will you give me for not telling them you took it to school? You could write to the Secretary of the UN while you're about it. Don't you see that with our people shooting at our people, one can't sit back and do nothing. And how will you address them? Honoured Mr Hrushchev and dear Mr Eisenhower? Or vice-versa? You could send the third copy to the Pope. God damn it! Women will be women. Here we are in the centre of a world crisis, they still shove their spoons into the spokes of history's wheels. May l ask in what language do you intend to write? - What do you mean in what language? - You can't speak English or Russian. Hold it! They've got interpreters. Even for Japanese. - What the hell do you want to write? - What the hell? The solution. The conclusion. The pan was filled to the brim, the milk boiled over. Don't worry l know what to say. Time for you to get out, the day after tomorrow you can come in. - See? After tomorrow. - Yes, of course. Then peace. Milk and honey. Everybody will come off well. l've got it all worked out. Will we have the UN in Budapest? - The UN will come to Budapest? - He's out of his mind. There will be nothing in Budapest if the typewriter doesn't turn up. Annamari! Annamari! Get up! Where's the typewriter? Only she can have hide it. Open up! Open up at once! Annamari, my dear daughter, it was my typewriter. Give it back. Tell me where did you put it. Annamari! You can't do that to your grandmother. And to your father. Look my dear, l'm on my knees begging you to tell me where the typewriter is. For your poor grandfather and me it was a cherised keepsake. Like a gun for a soldier. Annamari! Let your father in! He needs to go. What are you doing here, little brat? - l'm not a little brat. - Tell me, little brat! Where are you taking that typewriter? Home. Put it down. No. lt's ours. lt's my granny's typewriter. Don't answer back! Put it down! lt belongs to my granny. l'm taking it away. No, you won't. You'll put it down. Brat! The school isn't yours. You're a thief. And you're a rat. Did you think you'd get away? Stand up! Who is a rat? Scram! They must be shooting at Krisztina square. Got nayone there? Yes. Ring him. lt's just that l've been thinking of him a lot these days. l got over it a long ago, but now... lf you want to know how he is, ring him. - Here you are! - What shall l do with it? Pick it up, dial, enquire. You're mad. - There's even a dialing tone. - Are you gone mad? - lf l embarrass you, l'll go out. - No! You ring him. Me? l didn't wanted to talk to him. l just wanted to know whether... - Whether... - ...the shooting was troubling him? Because if so, we'll have it stopped. Tell me the number. 1 72... 277. Yes, hallo... Hallo! He's alive. He's alive. Dad, is that bombing? lt's not here. Somewhere far away. Wait! Come into our bad. Come on! Don't open it. He ought to. What now? lt's not the kind of ring. Your Stalins ought to be burnt or they'll massacre the whole house. Where? lt can't be done in our flat. All we can burn is sawdust. Come! Annamari, Tomi, come here! All right, light the stake. We'll carry them over my place. Eyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground. Let's have a look, said Eyore and he turned slowly round the place, where his tail had been a little while ago. And then, finding that he couldn't catch it up, he turned round and at last he said with a long, sad sight: l believe you're right. Wait! Give it to me. ''lt can't be a coincidence that you and Comrade Stalin have your birthdays'' ''on the same days.'' ''Happy birthday, Franciska'' ''December 21 , 1950.'' R?kosi M?ty?s, comrade and friend. R?kosi M?ty?s, comrade and friend. R?kosi M?ty?s, comrade and friend. - R?kosi M?ty?s... - Stop it! - ...comrade and friend. - Stop it! Stop it! Don't you understand? Come on! Come on! Come on! - l'm not going anywhere. - What? l haven't slept well for 10 years, so why should l go elsewhere to sleep badly? Don't do that, mummy. My problem is that l hate your younger brother. How can you say before the children? You've never said that before. l'm saying it now. l'm going home. l've nothing to fear. You're wrong in saying l'm unpopular. People like me. - Besides l'll take care of Szidi. - What has Szidi got to do with this? Don't yell at my mother. l won't have it. There's a curfew nad she's walking up and down with her pillow. Szidi doesn't need taking care of. She's a grown-up. She needn't be left alone either. - The typewriter disappeared. - Oh, mummy, what should a maid want a typewriter for? l didn't say she wanted it. l said l was going home. l like that girl as a matter of fact. Listen! l'm not frightened. Understand? Not me. lt's my family l'm worried about. You mix up everything. You're a clown. All right, let's go. Come on! What are you doing, daddy? lt's good, eh? Tell me, daddy, have we got to stay here a long time? Come here! Come here! Drink it down! What would you say if... ...we went to another country? Your father would become a dancer. A tap-dancer. Do you know what's this? And you wouldn't be a director anymore? No. l wouldn't. Granny won't be pleased. Maybe we'd leave granny at home. Someone has to take care of the siren. ''He often dreamt that he was flying but something pulled him down.'' ''Now he succeeded at last in realizing his dream.'' ''He was sailing freely in the blue heights with his wings,'' ''and heard someone calling out from the darkness below.'' ''- Pelle, come here! - l'm coming, he answered and closed his wings wearily.'' What is he talking about? What's up? As a matter of fact l didn't understand a single word. Not a single word? She's preparing for a language exam. 20 forints English lessons. - Twice a week. - To hell with your radio. The whole thing's a mess. Oh, my God! Heavens, the armchair! Stupid men! While they listen to the radio they don't even notice that the child is drunk. l didn't understand anything. l think he said that... ...that by a certain deadline... ...arms should be laid down. Listen! That's fantastic! And l don't even know English. Arms have to be laid down? - Does it make any difference? - lt does to me. To me it doesn't. What osrt of man are you, Ferenc? Are you a Hungarian? Annamari, bring me my shoes. l'm going away. l'll be a tap-dancer. - Really? - Yes. Congratulations. Why didn't l hit upon the idea? With your physique... Anyone can see you're born a dancer. You lot can go on firing at each other. Putting each other in jail. Denouncing each other. - Find some music! - All right. l'll find some. Ladies and gentlemen! Misters and misisses, the Hungarian tap-dance prodigy. He beats Fred Aster and Ginger Rogers. Come on! Half-price for Hungarians. My dear old brother. Watch his technique! His knees creak a bit, he's growing bald, but never mind. The rhythm is maddening, the pace is stunning. He combats his lumbago with clenched teeth. The world's oldest dancer! The Hungarian tap-dancing prodigy! Fred Aster... Apologize at once! No one's going to apologize here. - Why have they stopped here, daddy? - Come on! l'll be hanged because of you. Come on, children, into the bath! ls the outing over? Do we have peace? We'll have a shower and forget the whole thing. Yes. But l've come to love brandy. That's something we won't forget. Mother! You should've seen this. Show mother how you dance. Come on! Come on! - You're drunk. - All right, l'll show her. l'll be a naked dancer. - What?! - Mother is one too. Why don't you ever laugh? Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! My serve. - Let. - What? You couldn't return it. - lt touched the net. - You say that. Don't pretend you didn't notice. l'm not blind yet. - New serve. - What for? Don't cheat, Tomi! - Well? - Serve again! - Aren't you ashamed yourself? - lt was let. You can't take defeat. Nor can you. Aren't you a bit too cheeky? l am. Then let's play that you can serve lets. Good. New serve. Andor! lt looks like Andor. Andor. Bakos. B?r?ny. Baumgartner. Buglya. l ask you something. Who's going to feed them tomorrow? And the day after? Are we going to rush in every day? They'll die anyway. Strasszer, my son! What was the homework for today? Haj?s, no prompting! Or you'll get... ...a report. Stop fidgeting, Weininger! Look, how nicely Szatm?ri is sitting. - Andor. - Bakos. - Baumgartner. - B?r?. - Bugylya. - Buza. - Cegl?di. - Csortos. - D?nos. - Kerekes. - K?roly. Class, attention! Get the typewriter and we'll clear off. The dirtyrat stole it. At the request of the government we inform the inhabitants of Budapest, that prohibition of alcoholic drinks is still in force. According to some informations prohibition is being violated, as a result of which the peaceful population is endangered. Considering there are many weapons in circulation, drunkness may lead to serious consequences. After a short break we'll continue with music... What do you want? l got it for you. For me? From where? From Paja. For two days. You're a good boy. - Aren't you going to look at it? - Oh, yes... Lovely. Very nice. Nicer than your grandmother's. Unfortunately, we have to give it back the day after tomorrow. The type is nice too. Do l disturb you? - Can l watch you? - Me? - While you're writing the letter. - What letter? The one you wanted to write to Hruhschev and Eisenhower. To set things right. Of course... lt slipped my mind. Well, let's see. Come on! How... Dear... ...Eisenhower and Hrushchev! Or... All right... l'm writing for you... ...at the request of my son. l'm a little delayed... ...because... ...our typewriter got lost. Point. All l want to tell is... ...l want to tell you, ...that... All l want to tell you is... ...a comma, only... Oh, Tomi, Tomi! lt can't be done like this, as simply as a school composition. These people are really important. They have secretariats, with lots of idlers, pre-readers. Even if l wrote the letter, it would get lost. They'd never get it. Because who am l after all? Father, please! Write it! Show them! l only want to tell you that... ...all l want is... Why are you staring at me? l cannot write when you stare at me. - You, for instance. - Me? - l didn't say a word. - l know. But l object to the way you did it. This is a personal matter and you keep peeping into everything. She didn't say a word... Dear Eisenhower ?s Hrushchov! l'm writing to you at the request of my son. l'm delayed because our typewriter got lost. l only want to tell you... The Prime Minister's message. Today at dawn Soviet troops launched an attack on our capital, with the obvious intention of overthrowing the lawful Hungarian democratic government. Our troops are fighting. The government is in its place. l'm announcing this to the people of the country and the public opinion of the world. l won't play with you. With me? l've never cheated. l've been playing ultimo for 20 years. With me red is red, and green is green. And l play the trump last. - What are the trumps now? - l don't play with you. What's got into him? He gambles away hundreds, that's why he's in this state. - Why does he pick a quarrel with me? - Red pays double.. Am l to blame for everything? Do you want to play? Me? Where is Terbek? He's joined up. To fight. - Are you joking? - Do you want to play or not? Faster! Hey, you, faster! He's got a name, you know. Uncle Akos. Oh, my dear son! Get acquainted. A colleague of mine. - Good morning! - Good morning! - Hello. - We've come for some food. - Wise of you. - Get acquainted. - What was it like here? - lt was quiet here, son. Was it you who rang me that night? l was thinking of you. The English lessons. - Let's start again. Marry me. - You're crazy. Come, we are leaving, Tomi! - What's happening? - Come on, big boy. Are you coming? Get him to come. Tomi, let's go. lt's cold. - l'll fall off. - You won't fall off. You didn't fall off on the way here. You'll ride bareback. Come! You'll sit behind me. - l'm not going. - What do you mean? - What's got into the boy? - l'll talk to him. Tomi, don't be stubborn. What's the matter, my dear? They are waiting for us. They'll be worried. We're taking food home. By evening they will be in Vienna. Don't do this to me, darling! Don't punish me. Shall l send ?kos away? A cloth! A pencil! Tirana? Missed. Caracas. Venezuela. Are you coming with me to Caracas? We start at two. Christ! She's got whooping cough! Whooping cough? lt isn't whooping cough. l've raised one or two children. And as for Venezuela, we aren't going there. lf anywhere, we'll go to my Giza, in America. But we may not go anywhere. Once l missed going away. And this is the result. Now l'm going. You've got till this evening to decide. Call up the doctor on duty. Stick your tongue out! She's got a cough, but it isn't a whooping cough. There's no problem. Doctor, may l whisper something to you? Shall l examine you? l'm not coughing. Come on, get up here. Take your trousers down. Your pants too. l swear you, everything's all right here. lt really is. Sure? Believe me, l'm not lying. A bone's grown in his willy. - There's no wrong with the girl. - Believe me, she doesn't caugh, she barks. Perhaps she's frightened. Of what? Aren't you frightened? Well, caracas, here l come. R?kosi, friend... Now you can hit me back. l found it here. Haven't l brought you to a good place? lt's empty. lt's wedged. Forward! Forward! Faster! ''Through mountains, through valleys the train is rattling on.'' ''Lasting peace is our slogan...'' M?ller! Gyuri! Come on! Don't play the fool! What do you want? The... cocoa. Can you prepare cocoa in the morning? For the children. And madam? Madam's gone. And the old madam? She stayed. Do you know that there are tribes in Africa where old women of a certain age are collected and taken to the jungle and tied to trees? - For how long? - For good. The old girls can only hope that the beasts will come quick. Do you know where your children hang out in the daytime? Because l don't. Where indeed? You've got dandruff. Shall l wash your hair? Now that we've become so chummy, why do you hate my brother? Because he's a bad man. - Keep still! - And what sort of man am l? - A bit of weakling. - Weakling? You, of course, you're strong. Oh, it stings! The towel, quickly! So, you are strong, eh? Me, my boy... l don't really know how l am. And the siren? l bet it got rusty long ago. l keep watching over a deaf and dumb siren. You know that well enough. All l know is that your daughter took her suitcase and left me. Don1t worry, you fool. She'll come back. Close your eyes. Annamari's wet her paints again. l'd like to come in. The handle should be repaired. lt came off. Now? lt's 5:15. l'm still asleep. l'm just dreaming that... What now? l don't know.
