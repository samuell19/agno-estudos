Give me some more time For one week,till 10th... After that also,if you feel like this tell me We'll leave it What will happen in one week? Why unnecessarily... Anything may happen within one week..

If you have even a little,when you do not see me,would be much better! You didn't even see whether we are alive or.... I do have care for you in plenty only you're not recognizing it! Not a day passes without your thoughts and its distress! Have you ever felt distressed with my thoughts? You would have only cursed me isn't it,sister? How are you? How many time I would have called Nadar's stores! Did you come even once on the line? You too have left me,isn't it? Mother,how's father? He has been Hospitalised! Mother! Why? What happened? What do I know? Did I study Medicine? That's...what did they say? Did they say it as Jaundice? Have they diagonised it Immediately? Mother,why has he been admitted into a Hospital? I want to see father immediately! Don't tell him that,I had met you and talked with you! He'll get better,if he sees you! I have come here to beg you,to come & see your father! Hey! Didn't you go to work? It seems father isn't keeping good health! We'll go and... ...We don't have parents!!! You have only"me" and I have only"you" that's what you had said! He has been admitted into the Railway Hospital! Shakthi! Who told you that? Why do you want that?.... Who told you? Mother told me! I met her in the Train! Without coming to Home! Without my knowledge only for you! Karthik,please listen to what I say? He's just an ordinary Railway Employee! He struggled and took loans to make me study Medicine! Now,he's not well!.... If I don't go there now,what's use of me studying Medicine? Okay! You go and see him!... ....But,I'll not come!! Karthik,Can't you do atleast this for me? Shakthi! Do you want me to come there throwing away my honour,prestige! He has slapped me! ....I can never forget it! Even my own father has never beaten me! It's better to die than to come face to face with him! In this world I don't have even 10 people who I may need!! If I want you,I have to forsake them! If I want them,then,I have to forsake you! How is it possible? Shakthi,do whatever you feel like doing? If You want them, go their home,Go If you want to come back or may be not! Do whatever you want to do? But,Please leave me alone! Just one marriage means so many troubles! I don't know how people marry 2 or 3 times? Our Rohit will marry.... ...2 or 3... How is your father? How do I know? I had told you to go and see your father! You had even told about killing yourself! Okay!.... Tomorrow,we both will go! No Karthik! We'll not go to the House who don't respect you! Leave that aside! Tomorrow morning we'll go! You go inside and see him! I'll stand outside! Please,you also come inside! Let him see that we are happy together! Are we really happy?!

Dream of making me a Doctor.... ...He never had any other wish! Mother,when he wasn't well where was I? Why do you need marriage and family?... ...Saying this why didn't you beat me and brought me back to Home? Why did you leave me? Was he so angry on me? He left without even seeing me!

I could have taken her there and spoken with him! I was obstinate! Okay! Leave it! Why do you want to unnecessarily take it upon yourself and get distressed? My father used to say always... That he'll go only after marrying me to a good boy Shakthi! Elders will never go away from us! They'll always be with us! He would have come to know that Karthik is a good boy! That's why,he has left us and went away! Take this coffee... ...Please have this coffee,my child! How many more days,are you going to cry within yourself? Then,what do you want me to do?! Anger can't be dissolved with tears! I am not angry on anyone! I am angry on myself for being selfish I had decided considering only my choice!! That's why,God has done all this! Why are you beating around the bush? ...Why don't you say it straight on my face? That you have killed my father!! Not you....it's me!!! Look.... ...The man who's gone,isn't going to come back! Whenever you cry! As if you're saying it's all because of you!! Tell me,if you don't want to see me! Even I'll also get lost! Alright! You also go away! After that without anyone for me I'll distress alone and die! What'll be my fate? what's written in fate?... Stop!! Enough!! Don't talk with me for my entire life! It's enough!... ...What I mean to say.... No need,don't say anything! It's alright! When I can live without my father! I can live without you also! Don't worry! Where are you going? Leave me! Don't utter even a word! It's enough! Hello! Is it Hyundai Factory? Can I speak to works manager Mr.Raghuraman? What should I say? It's enough,if you say only what is written on this?! I wouldn't be in any soup,isn't it? Talk softly like a girl! that's enough! Hello I am.... ....I am unable to talk! I'll hit you! Look here and talk! My name is Poorni! Soft soft soft.... My name is Poorni,I am calling from Tambaram Nirmala College! Do you remember me? How are you? I went....I went to meet you! for a while Me?!?....why? Don't worry! I'll not kidnap you! I am Raghuraman from Hyundai factory speaking! What do you want? I want to meet you personally for a small talk! Your family had insulted us isn't that enough? Please,only for 5 minutes! When you're going home,I'll meet you at Besant Nagar Bus Stop by 4 PM I'll meet you by 4 PM only for 5 minutes,please!! It seems he is that Hyundai Guy! Only God should save! My family was destroyed dispersed and perished! Are you happy? The day you came and went away they had started crying... It hasn't yet stopped! Is it enough? Whatever happened,has happened? If you think that all was wrong because of our wrong doings... I don't think this will come good... Calling personally one who is depressed to feel happy! What do I do without getting angry on such people? Excuse me! You only called me! Me!?! You only called me! Am I mad? No! You only called my factory to meet personally... Not me! You only called my bank! Wasn't it you who had talked? Told me to come at 4 p.m to disrespect me personally! Who's that,who had called me by 4.30 p.m? I am quitting from this game! Is it your handy work? What do you think of yourself? Are you bringing a couple together? Otherwise are you working as a Marriage broker? I feel like using choicest abuses... The marriage which was stopped because of me! A small wish that it may happen that's all! You have done so much for Shakthi! For that,I wanted to repay by doing a good thing but... Please forgive me! What? Is it a flop? Is it a bigger flop than our company? Come! Its more than 10 days since we talked with each other! Marriage means,it'll be like that only! Do you know that,not a single day passes without me and Rajesh fighting? We were never like that! May be Karthik doesn't like me anymore! Leaving you,he isn't roaming with other girls! Why bother? Look,everything will be alright! I was considering you both as perfect in all our group! Why are you bothering yourself? ...Come...! One ice-cream for both of you! What did you say?... What did she say that day... ...Am I a marriage broker to bring a couple together? She wanted to mouth choicest abuses?.. Now,it doesn't seem to look like that! Are you both convinced? Why are you staring? Come on tell!... Hey! When is the marriage?... When is the marriage? He has told that he'll come and talk in another 2 days! I want to tell you one thing... Okay,I'll tell you later! In my office Rohit's marriage has been settled! With both families consent! ...Not like us! Tomorrow,all my friends are going out together! We two are going... Did you hear? There may be 100 problems between us! But no one outside should know about it! They are thinking that we both are an ideal couple! Come atleast for me! How did you manage to bring her? Everything is like that only! Now it'll be like that only! But after marriage you're a gonner Doomed forever! Hey! Ashok! Keep quiet! You seem to look like a very good girl! How did you deceived like this with Rohit? Just as I got deceived by Shakthi Another sinner got stucked up! Hey! What's all this guys? Instead of Greeting,why are you scaring me? Buddy! You're getting really married! No,don't do it! It'll be very difficult! Isn't it? Well said! Hey! You'll get thrashed! You are married and happy! Are you scaring one who's going to get married? Hey Boy! You don't worry! After marriage all men will be like this only! Their true colours will be out! How,How,How.... First they'll open the car door! After that,they'll hold the umbrella! After that,with great love... they'll chase like gentlemen! But after marriage... After?... Everything will fly out of the windows! Look at me! I am even pressing my wife's legs! It's more than enough if you don't pull my legs! Only 25 days are remaining for the marriage! You get married! The difficulties I am undergoing,let this whole World also undergo! Okay...Okay...Who all want me to marry? Who..Who... Now who all don't want me to marry? Marry...but... Tell...Tell...Tell... My sorrow is lost... My happiness is lost... My happiness is lost! September month!...September month Lost the sorrows of the life! September month...September month! Lost the sorrows of the life! October month...October month! Lost the happiness of life! When you lost your sorrows... Love was born at that time.... When you lost the happiness.. You got married at that time.. September month...September month Lost the sorrows of the life October month...October month Lost the happiness of life! When you lost your sorrows... Love was born at that time... When you test the happiness... You got married at that time! Oh girl! Love is like a feast of sweets! Marriage is the bitterness of the neem! Oh! My boy! Love sees only strengths Marriage sees only weaknesses! Oh Girl! Love is seen only by half eye! Marriage is seen by 4 pairs of eyes! On the tip of the noses,love enjoys even the beauty of crows! After marriage even mole hills become mountains! Why this clashes? Men without women,man can't have the consolation! If women aren't there in this World men may never need consolation! September month...September month! October month...October month! I have found out the love means heavy chains! Marriage means Auspicious chain what can I do? Postpone the marriage till 90 and come my love,let's cross 100 also? My friend! I don't get the love's irons and splinters in marriage's cot! There's no happiness in relationship in which there isn't a separation! That's what is love! Come let's live with sometime with relationship and sometime with separations! Without men,women don't have the consolation! If there aren't any men in this World there's no need for consolation! September month...September month Lost the sorrows of the life! October month...October month Lost the happiness of life! When you lost your sorrows! Love was born at that time... When you lost the happiness... You got married at that time You have lost interest in me,isn't it? Why are you starting it now? Or else has marriage become bitter? What I said was just for fun... If you don't feel like that in your heart,will it come out? What do you mean by saying that you have lost happiness after marriage? You don't like me.... It means you like some one else! Why are you killing me? Whatever I do,Is it wrong? Then do you say that you haven't done anything wrong? I am like that only... I had seen in the street corner! Then,why did you marry me? You should have married the girl you like? It was a mistake!!... I and you shouldn't have married! We should have remained as friends! I am able to understand very well what you're saying! Look!...Crying... What cruelty have I done to you for crying like this? I have done the cruelty! Leaving my parents behind I came believing you! That was the biggest mistake I had committed! Why this love marriages? Is it necessary? If you don't want then get away! Leave me also! Even I'll live in peace! I am unable to understand these women! This love...this marriage! Marriage means...We have to sacrifice little things for each other! We have to keep her before our self interest! Throw away this Ego! What was the reason that made you to love Shakthi? Meeting her in Beach hugging in Parks! What you see in Cinema is not at all love! Boy! That is not love! Its just an infatuation before marriage! Flower...just like a flower! It'll be intoxicated,fragrant and beautiful! ...But it'll wither away! What you get after marriage... ...Is like Roots! It'll be inside the soil rooted firmly! Whatever may happen you must make small sacrifices! Sacrifice! Want a small?! Oh! God! How much I have to search for you? Are you trying to hide from me? I want to tell you one thing! But I am unable to understand how to tell you about it? At this age,I am feeling shy... Hey! Why didn't you tell me about this earlier itself? Did I hide anything from you? No!
