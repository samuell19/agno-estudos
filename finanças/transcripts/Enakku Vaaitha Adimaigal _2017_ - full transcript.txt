Flowers of glass have no color I never opened up about my love for you. There are no words in silence. You deprived me off my sleep. You are a flower on blazing fire Taking away my breath at a glance It is because of you My heart is a dancing chariot. With love bubbling in my eyes There are streaks of lightening in my heart I am filled with your thoughts I am filled with love! Your glance makes me a child yearning for a candy! You make my heart crumble like a deck of cards. You make me fly and dance like a bird. You make me crawl like a child. You make me melt like a candle. I will be your shadow even in darkness. Flowers of glass have no color I never opened up about my love for you. There are no words in silence. You deprived me off my sleep. Who will I talk to without you? In previous generation... No such friends are like me and rajini...!!! Even if you don't express, I understand the feelings inside me. Love has blossomed inside You make me fly and dance like a bird. You make me crawl like a child. You make me melt like a candle. I will be your shadow even in darkness. Why do you keep rubbing me? Move aside. I will be on the road if I move further. Go ahead. Why would I care? There is a lot of space up there and yet you want to sit next to me. There is only space on you! Shall I sit? I dare you! I thrash your jaw. You sit down. You sit on top. He talks too much. I will change the shape of his face. You seem to be a little out of shape as well. Keep your mouth shut. Or else I'll whack you. I look like am already whacked! Can you keep quiet? You keep telling me. - Is there space for two? - For two? There is space for four! - Move a little - Where is the space to move? Move aside and sit. Shall we go? Where do you want to go? There is no space. I was inside the auto. You all asked me to move and now am out of the auto. Forget it. There is space this side. Please stop towards the left. Can't you all be careful? Why won't you use the indicator to show that you are taking a left? Are you from a village? When has a share auto used an indicator? We ourselves are unaware of when we turn left or right. You need to watch out. How can you leave without apologising? How dare you touch me? I'll thrash you. Thrash? I dare you! How can we be responsible when you all oogle at girls while driving and cause an accident? Mind your business or else I'll file a police complaint that you disturbed me. Mohideen, start the vehicle. Look at their faces! He hit the back! Stop the vehicle. I just got the fitness certificate for the vehicle. Thank god the poster is not damaged. The back is just fine. He didn't hit on the vehicle. They were quiet. She aggravated them by telling that she would file a complaint against them. Calling from BTalk. Thanks for calling BTalk. May I know your name please. Tell me your name first. My name is Sowmya Narayanan He has a female name. So your mom calls your as 'Dear Sowmya' is it? Excuse me. Please intimate what information do you need? I will tell you. Why are you getting pissed off? I has Rs.31 as my phone balance. I checked after my bath, there was just Re.1 I called up customer care immediately and a guy named Joseph attended to my call. I told him the story and he said that the money has been deducted for Hello tunes. I used swear words at him. Swear words! Are you there? - Yes sir. Please tell me. Make some noise if you are still there. Make a louder noise! Tell me sir. Wait. My area engineer wants to talk to you. Did you think that no one will question you? Refund the money. Or else, I will bring all the women of our area to your office and swear against you. I can only take the complaint. I cannot refund the amount. How dare you talk to me like that? I will give it to the area councillor. Hey you! His mother slogs to sell guavas and makes a little money... ...and he looted it to recharge his phone... ...and you loot from his phone... This is as good as stealing from a begger. - Let me speak - You want to talk? Talk to him in English. These guys! - Talk to me. - Hang up you fools. The line got disconnected. You hung up while taking it from me. Why do you guys irritate him everyday? You see the government school behind you? We studied together till the 9th grade there. He used to be very friendly then. Ever since he got a job, he looks at us with disgust. These are young fellows and they have some fun with him. You are as old as a buffalo and still you join them? He is asking for the Rs.1000 he lent to me. Will everyone be like me? The whole city will be disgusting if people are like you. I don't care about you all. The shop is that way. I got confused. Please give Such a hot lady! Unlike my wife! - Where is the account no? - I had filled in! Can you please fill in? Fill it and come. She does not even bother! - What is this? - Photo Did I call it an auto? Should I deposit it in your account? Not mine. This has to be deposited in your account. Dad! Did you get whacked by mom? You will get whacked by this lady just like how I am being whacked. Can you make sense? I have lot of work here. Please excuse me. I have filled in the account number. There is no IFSC code in this. IPS code!!! What crap is that? The name of the girl is Vanathi. Her father is a cop. The address is behind the picture. You meet them at evening 4 pm. She is beautiful. It's not possible today. Lot of works here. The manager will not grant any permission. I knew that you would lie and hence I've got permission from your manager. Your marriage cannot be postponed any further. I have filled in the code that you specified. The phone number is not filled in. Phone number? He is insulting me a lot infront of my girl! What are you looking at? Make it fast. Shall we all go in the evening and meet the family? All of us? Not required! You meet the girl first. If you like her, then we will proceed further. You want me to go alone? How can I talk to a girl who is a stranger? Do I have to teach you all this? - Dear Son... - Sir... You please leave... I will explain to cashier. What you will explain to me? Let me explain all this to your husband first. Why are you threatening that baby? Is she a baby? You please leave. I'll find my way. You meet the girl first. Don't you meet some other girl! Sir, please excuse me. I have filled up everything. The date is not filled yet. Date? I don't want to deposit any cash in your bank! I did all this to irritate you! What is your name? Krishna What's your age? Where do you work? IT Do you know the full form of IT? - Information Technology. Why? - No It is InTerior damage! Almost 11 IT employees have consulted me from this morning. What is the problem? The sweat is not going out and the stress is getting in. Forget that. What is your problem? I don't like to live anymore. I feel like committing suicide. Why do you feel like that? - Divya left me. - Who is Divya? My ex-girlfirend. So it is love failure. Don't talk like a fool. How can love fail? Only people who fall in love fail. Now tell me if I suffer from love failure? No What? How is it not possible? A girl has cheated me... I've come to you for counselling. What do mean when you say that this is not love failure? Is this love failure or not? Tell me now! I think he is at an advanced stage! - Tell me now. - Let me drink some water. - Now! Tell me now! - I will explain! Listen I am a psychiatrist. You need to talk to me peacefully. Let us do one thing. Whatever happened in your life.. Explain them sequentially without missing out anything. I will ask a few questions that you like whenever required. Is that fine? Now sit down. Come on. Start your life story. Let me tell you. Due to the attitude that we earn a lot in the IT industry... ...every weekend we go on a tour to some place as a gang. Yeppie! We have reached Kodaikanal! We are 8 in the gang. Six of them are lovers. The remaining two are not in love. One is myself and the other is Divya. Do you know how beautiful she is? More than me explaining it will be better if someone else says how beautiful Divya is. Dude! The yellow one is fantastic. I wonder who would get her! Thanks. We must marry someone like this. Or else, we must remain as bachelors till the end. That guy has said the right thing only. Ofcourse he was right. - But he said something after that. - What is it? But one thing... Beautiful girls like these... ... always fall in love or marry some horrible boys! This one is again rightly said by that guy. I am sorry to interrupt. Please proceed. In a group of lovers, do you know what people who are not in love do? Dude, Can you click a picture of both of us? Give. Come closer. Divya was also doing the same work that I was doing. If our work is to click pictures, their work is to bully us. Come closer. Much more closer. Come stand closer. Yes! Sorry ! Look at that! - Put your hand over her. - Smile. Shut your mouth. - Wait. Something is missing. - Yes! Just a moment. Can you please hand me your kid? Look at your dad! Carry your kid.. Dude, good job. Stand closer. You move out of the frame. Wonderful! KD! What is KD? That is... Krishna.. Divya.. K D If your name was Balaji, they woud've called you BD! It is a good joke indeed. If I was in a good mood, I would've laughed a lot. Since, I am in a different mood, I feel like throwing something at you! Don't touch that weapon. I am sorry to interrupt again. I will not disturb anymore. You proceed. Ok. Hey KD Make it fast. Shall we go. Since Divya is wearing black, are you also wearing black to match with her? Oh my! Have you all started again! If I had known this earlier, I wouldn't have worn this. Don't act. This is a planned one. Yes. It is planned. Now what? I like her guts the most. Whoever bullies her... She is never bothered and counters them with confidence. Even though she rebuked them, they kept bullying us. It was raining like hell At the door, there was a lady with tears. I enquired about her distress Swami... A guy dumped me in the middle of the road. Can you drop me at Teynampet? All that I had was an omni... The girls are here. They will also be listening to this. Where is Divya? She has no mood to eat it seems. So she didn't come. We have the mood to eat. So let's eat. Dude, Is this chicken or mutton? Hey! Dad will call now. The phone... Oh my! Go fetch it soon. He talks everyday with his dad. May I come in? Hey Krishna. Come in. Why didn't you come for dinner? I don't feel good. You must not sleep with an empty stomach. Have this apple atleast. No thanks. I am telling you. Take it. Have it. Good night. Oh my god! He keeps nagging over the phone always! Hey Shivani. It seems there is a new laptop from Apple. Not just laptop. They have just introduced Iphone 7. Hey, I just got reminded when you said Apple. It seems the apples in kodaikanal are very tasty. Let's buy some when we leave. Instead of having such heavy foods at night time, we can just have an apple. Who saw it? You fraud. Your phone is here and your dad called is it? You liar! You fraud! As they were bullying us earlier, this apple issue became the trump card! We were bullied by everyone. Can I use your restroom? Please go ahead. Let me also relax for a while. All this bullying started creating certain feelings within us. We were irritated when they used to bully us. Then we started expecting them to bully us. I couldn't look at her the way I used to look. She also couldn't look at me in the normal way. I can't look at all this horrible stuff. Pull up your zip. Oh my! Did you see it? A peculiar patient. Do you know how we looked at each other? Flowers of glass have no color I never opened up about my love for you. There are no words in silence. You deprived me off my sleep. You are a flower on blazing fire Taking away my breath at a glance It is because of you My heart is a dancing chariot. With love bubbling in my eyes There are streaks of lightening in my heart I am filled with your thoughts I am filled with love! Your glance makes me a child yearning for a candy! You make my heart crumble like a deck of cards. You make me fly and dance like a bird. You make me crawl like a child. You make me melt like a candle. I will be your shadow even in darkness. Flowers of glass have no color I never opened up about my love for you. There are no words in silence. You deprived me off my sleep. Who will I talk to without you? Even if you don't express, I understand the feelings inside me. Love has blossomed inside Without the knowledge of anyone Till we are together Our eyes speak a million words. You make me fly and dance like a bird. You make me crawl like a child. You make me melt like a candle. I will be your shadow even in darkness. Flowers of glass have no color I never opened up about my love for you. There are no words in silence. You deprived me off my sleep. You are a flower on blazing fire Taking away my breath at a glance It is because of you My heart is a dancing chariot. Your love story is very smooth until now, isn't it? - Even after that also it was smooth only. - Then what is the issue? - It has been a while since I smoked. - So? - Shall I continue as I smoke? - Idiot Smoking is wrong. And you say that you want to smoke in front of a psychiatrist? Get up first. Let me at least finish this off. I am not interested in listening to your useless story. - This part will be very interesting. - Interesting? - Is it? - Yes The turning point in my life is Kodaikanal. It is generally very cold there. You should be knowing the temperature at night. The boys couldn't bear the cold. They were begging with their lovers to get cozy. Gayathri. Am I not agreeing for jogging with you even in this cold? I've been trying to get cozy with you for long. Why are you not agreeing to it? You never agreed for it in Munnar. You never agreed to it in Wayanad either. I will marry you for sure. I am not able to control. If I agree to this as you are begging, later I will have to beg with you to marry me. - What? - Come dear. Not possible. Go now. Please. Listen. My mom has warned me not to do all this before marriage. If you keep asking me for it, I will break up with you. I should break up with you for your behaviour. Are you trying to touch me as you kick? You can never have me! Krishna Please come here. Are you not asleep yet? How do I sleep? What happened? I am not able to close this window. Its very cold. Let me check. It's stuck. Why are you getting tensed? Switch on the torch. Let me switch on the flash in my phone. - I love you Krishna. - I love you too. How? How is that possible? People who have already proposed were begging... Without even proposing, you have done so much and you sit here like a child! I also don't understand that. Everything happens very fast in life for me. It happened as soon as I proposed and she left me as soon as it got over. She left you? Hey… The opening is very well. The first part is very well. If the next part is not so good... It means the subject is not good. Are you a psychiatrist or a sex doctor? You talk rubbish. Am I the one talking rubbish? I lent you my ears yearning for a love story. You gave me a vulgar story and now you say that I talk rubbish. Let me ask you decently. What is the reason for that girl to leave you? Hmmm…. Tell me. They are the reason. They are an amazing couple. She is the one whom I was in love with. Horrible! She was with you and now she looks very close with this guy. That is what I don't understand. We don't know when they will hug us or dump us. I don't understand anything. Don't cry my dear! Does that guy know that you were in love with her? He knows whatever I did to her. How did he agree to it after knowing everything? That is his character. His cycle, bike and car is all second hand stuff! Forget it. Some people have such horrible taste. Hey. You get furious on me for making you sit with me for an hour. She has cheated you and did you just spare her? Do you think I would've spared her? What did you do to her? Hey Divya! Come out. You fell in love with me and now you want to marry Rupesh? I've lost my virginity because of you. Isn't it pricking your conscience? Will you now go inside or should I come outside? What? I am here? What is your problem? You have drunk to hide your fears and now you shout here! You are shouting as well. Does that mean you are drunk? Krishna, What is it? Aunty! Good evening. When she explained that it is not happening between you both, shouldn't you be backing off? Correct aunty! - You always say the right things. - Thanks! I am telling you the same. You don't get involved in this... or else... I will swear at you. Get lost! Don't you talk to my mother like that. I was never interested in you from the beginning. Since our friends were teasing us, my mind got diverted. Now my mind is clear. My life is only with Rupesh. - Do you understand? - Yeah yeah! Very well. I understand that you are clear with a reason to dump me. Answer me for this. I understand that your friends teased and your mind diverted. Why did you make love to me then? Stop blackmailing with that. It's not even a point of concern these days. Is anybody listening? Who is that flashing light? - Why are you creating troubles here? - Welcome OLX! We used to kiss in the house and now you have brought me to the streets. It is all due to your relationship with her. Do you know how hard it is to maintain the girl that you love? It is very hard to maintain her. One day she will tell not to leave her. The next day she will say please leave me. On friday she will say that you are her world. On sunday she would ask if there is no else other than you in this world. She will be all fine Suddenly she would stop talking. If we call her up, she wouldn't pick. She would be online on whatsapp, but she would never reply. One day she will come and talk. We must also talk without any hesitation. If we show our attitude... We will end up like me! Every girl who is in a relationship would utter 'break up' more than 'love you' to the guy. But behind every instance of uttering 'break up' ..there is always a horrible guy like you. Why did you move away? Hey! Come here. The one who makes girls to change their facebook status from single to committed are called Swaggers! What do they call you guys who hook up with girls who are already committed? Tell me tell me…. Hey ! Let me tell you. So you got hit by him? Hey, It was not him. It was his friend. You seem to be proud of it. Hey, The girl did not bother about anything and went with another guy. You are a man and you say you want to commit suicide! Forget her and start looking out for another girl. You stupid. Hey, First you called me a fool. Now you add some more to it. Sorry sir! Sorry! I understand your frustration. Don't repeat it. Continue. She could've done like that. I will not do like that. Its not just me. Any guy who truly loves a girl will not do it. I know that I cannot live with her anymore. That's why I decided to die. It's a wrong decision. Do you have friends? Yes. I am asking about true friends. - You get angry when I shout at you. - Yes When you ask such stupid questions, how can I not shout at you? All friends are true friends only. What nonsense! If the sky is vast does it mean that it is completely filled with clouds? Clouds are those that stay and shower rains. Is everyone who shares pictures on facebook your friend? The ones who share your sorrows are your friends. Who are those two friends? Not two. There are three of them. Names Mohideen, Sowmy and Ramesh. Do they know your love story? Yes. - Do they know that is has failed? - No sir! Why didn't you tell them? They will ask for booze if I tell them. They will drink and get high and start advising me. - That's why I didn't tell them. - That is a mistake. You say that they are your true friends. You should've told them your problem. Inform your friends about what happened, immediately. The thought of suicide will vanish. Then take the pill that I prescribed you. You will sleep well. If both of these do not work out... Take this card. What is this? Call me anytime. I will solve your problem immediately. The master is here. Let's start practicing. Dhanapal bro... Looks like you've appointed a delivery boy in your tea shop. The uniform is amazing. Welcome Sowmy. Would you like to have some tea? I am going to file a complaint with the cops. Do you file complaints for asking you to have tea? Ask them to stop it right away. You rotten face. Will we stop if you ask us to? We can't stop this. We will play another game and then stop. Are you all making fun! Hey Sowmy! - I will finish you off! - Why are you even talking to them? Go home. They keep irritating me quite often. Are you all picking up an unwanted quarrel? We didn't do anything. Your son kicked on the board while we were playing. Why will he do such a thing if you all were quiet? Dhanapal. I have informed you many times. If such a thing happens again I will complain with the association and ensure that your shop is vacated. Please go home. I will take care. Mom. Why are you even talking to them. Let's go home. Have this food dear. Hey you pig face! These kids have grown up to be rogues. Hello! There is board that does not allow salesmen. Who allowed you inside? I am Ramesh. My father's name is Rajamani. Didn't the broker inform you? Oh I am sorry! I mistook you for someone else. I am sorry! Please come in. Thank God! Keep talking. I'll be back. Hi. I've come to meet you. Why are you shy with your head bowed down? No! I am not shy at all. The saree pleats were not in order. So I was adjusting it. Then... Is this your first time? I meant... Is this the first time that you are coming to meet a girl? Yes. That's why I am a bit nervous. This is my first time as well. That is why I am nervous as well. You are nervous? Fine! Fine! I forgot to ask you. Would you like to have coffee or tea? Anything is fine. Did you come to see me with the same mindset? It's not like that. Coffee, tea, ragimalt... Anything is fine. Anyways, I don't know to make any of it. Mom! Coffee. Then... Are you a single son? I have a younger brother. R.Velmurugan. He works in a bank in Mumbai. - You don't have any sisters? - No If she was there, I could've picked up arguments with her. Fine. How is your mother? Mother is very silent. Oh my! I cannot pick up an argument with her either! Looks like I will not get such happy moments if I marry you. It's not like that. If I start talking high of you in front of my mom, then you will be tired of arguing with her! Vanathi.. Serve him the coffee. Thanks! You asked me so many questions. Can I ask you a question? I know what you are going to ask. Go ahead. Tell me what it is. Have you been in love before? Have you dated before... - Or have you all done anything before marriage? - No not that. No. Not that. In case you are in love, I can help you both to marry. Thank you very much for your magnanimity. But no girl would tell about her love life to the guy who is a proposal. You all will never tell and then later open up during the first night and spoil our mood. We will then be sleeping in the corner like a lost lover! Dude... Ramesh is here. He will ask for the snack. Welcome bank officer. High five! - Hi guys! - Hi! Where is KD Krishna? Forget the ones who are here. Always ask about the ones not here. He must be spending time with Divya. - Why did you call us? What is the matter? - I will tell you. I called you all to inform that. Tell us what it is and then take. I won't be able to come with you all for the movie next Diwali. As though you will be celebrating it with your in laws. Yes! You got a girl? Congrats dude! Where is she from? Vadapalani Who are the ones who finalized you from our locality? A cop! I will not have any more issues in accommodating more than ten people in my auto. Are you otherwise carrying any less? When is the wedding? To decide that my family is visiting their family tomorrow. Just a small engagement with only the family members. Not calling many people. So you are asking us not to come. Say it on our face! - It's not like that. - I know dude. The wedding will be grand. Or are you planning to have it in your house itself? Why is he talking like this? You might just do what he said. - I wanted to tell Krishna as well. - Call him. He is not picking any calls. It's switched off. Will he be busy with something? Why is he not picking up the call! Who is it calling?? Such a nuisance during an important time. - Hello - Hello, Mr.Muthuvinayagam? Yes speaking. Who is it? This is Krishna. I met you at the clinic this evening. There were so many who met me at the clinic. Who are you? The kodaikanal guy... Proposal.. - Oh my! Is it you! - Yes sir. You are not asleep yet? Did you have the sleeping pills that I gave you? I had it with me. But I don't know where I placed it. I have been searching it for a while. Why are you calling me without having the pills that I gave you? - Hang up the call. - Sir! I am very depressed and I don't feel like sleeping. Tell me where you are. I will come there and get the pills from you. What? Now? - Hang up the call. - It's not possible now. I am in an important work. Sir! I can hear some female voice. Isn't that the receptionist in your office? What receptionist? It's my wife. Wife?? You said you were in a work! Is this that work? Your patient is dying here. How can you enjoy there? What logic is that? Why should I postpone my enjoyment for you? Hey brother... brother. Why are you crying now? At an age when I should be living, I am planning to die. At an age when you must be dying, you are enjoying life. I am crying thinking of that. Hey … Hey, If you have the determination, you can also be happy like me. How can I be happy with your wife? Isn't that wrong? How dare you! You will never be cured even if a hundred psychiatrists treat you. You will roam on the streets like a lunatic with torn clothes. - Hang up the phone. - I am hanging up. Why are you not giving me any respect? A patient is crying here with suicidal thoughts and you are enjoying with your wife. Let me tell you something. I will die somehow today. After that every time you enjoy with your wife, you will be reminded of me. When am enjoying with my wife, I will be reminded of him?? Darling! Go to your mom's place and come after a month. For having counseled him, he made me go other places for my enjoyment. Oh god. My karma will not let you live in peace. I was so energetic. He has made me so dull! Where do you have to go? I want to just cross the road. Nobody stops here. Thanks. Why do you stop at anyone who sticks out their hand? Sunny Leone. Where are you going? It's going to my house. Hey Manohar! Looks like you've come home early. You seem to be staying at home always. What am I to do! My wife left to her native yesterday. You should go for work once in a while. If you keeping doing only that then this is how it will end up. My wife is at home. I can understand. Enjoy Enjoy! What are you doing? How come you are here so early? Why is everyone asking the same question? It's my house, my wife. I will come at any time. Where is Noushad? He has gone out to play. Oh is it. Then let us go and play. In broad daylight? Close the windows and it will be dark. - Wait let me put off the stove. - You can put it off later. - Wait! Wait! - It will be off when it is empty. Hey Noushad! Come here. What? Can't you see that am playing? Why do you disturb me? I'll thrash you! Why is he scolding like this? Hey, Your dad has got you a bat. - For me? - Yes. - It's a very big bat - A big one? Go now. Or else your dad might leave. Hey Abhi! My father has got me a big bat! Yeppie! You must have known about French Kiss and Kamal kiss... Why are you lying on mother? Won't it be painful for her. Get up now. Are you not playing? Where is the cricket bat? Who told you that I got a bat for you? Rohit's father told me. Manohar! Your revenge is fulfilled. Hey bro! Is it over so soon? So it is all your work! What wrong did I do to you? The whole village is on a strike and you earn with your auto! I will also take revenge when the time is appropriate. Why should I do all this? Don't laugh. It is all because of you. Will it be bitter? Today is a no moon day! Tomorrow is India Pakistan Cricket match! I now understand why you became a saint. When I see you I feel like I want to live. So please forgive me. You say that they are your true friends. You should've told them your problem. Tell your friends about what happened, immediately. The thought of suicide will vanish. Everybody is a police officer in our family. My son is in the army. May be my daughter knew of the hardships that we undergo and hence she did not want a cop as her husband. There were many proposals which we were not convinced. The broker told us about you and your family. Which is why we are here. As I had informed you earlier, my son's vacation is in two months. Okay. So we can have the wedding only after two months. What? Two months? - Why do you embarrass me? - Forget that. Put the apple down. Since it it your only son... How can we not have him for the wedding. We can have the wedding when he comes. Ok nice. Can we have the plates exchanged? Krishna. He won't pick when we call. Now he is calling. Why did he cut the call? I lost one rupee as well. I now understand why people have kids late after marriage. I must first put him in a hostel. Before that I have to put him in a school. Krishna! He has called me at the right time. Tell me Krishna. Are you still alive? How did they get to know this? Why didn't you come for the meeting at Sowmy's place? Why are you laughing for this? Are you making fun? Idiot! I am not laughing! I am crying. Why are you crying? - Divya has left me! - Oh my! Is it an accident or was she sick? When is the funeral? It doesn't mean that she is dead. She just left me for another guy. You girl is a lot better. Some girls have another guy when they are with us. I can't bear it Mohideen. I can't bear it too Krishna. I am not even able to hug my wife due to my neighbour Manohar. I wouldn't have been bothered if he had looted me of my money. He spoiled my sex life! I am going to die. Why are you committing suicide for my problem? You idiot! Divya has left me. I am committing suicide for that. What? Are you going to commit suicide? Listen! He is going to commit suicide for love it seems. Will anyone commit suicide for this? Are you not ashamed to say this? Who commits suicide for love these days? Forget that. Tell me who loves truly these days? I did! I did! Mohideen, Its very painful! Never mind. Have a two pegs. You will be fine. I am done with 15 pegs already. What? You had booze? What she did to you is not cheating. You left me and boozed. That is cheating. Tell me where you are. I'll come there. We will booze together. I've been noticing for a while. What you talking? Always looking out for free booze. Hang up! Going to die it seems. Will anyone inform others if they are going to commit suicide? You are like a motionless stone! Oh my Fathima! I have become a sinner who cannot even hug you! I am going to die and he is calling me to booze! Is he a friend! Oh my! This has poison! Thank God I didn't have it! Why am I drinking this? I should be drinking that, isn't it? Why is it so confusing! Let me call Sowmy Thanks for calling BTalk. What information would you like to know? I don't need to know any information. You need to know some information. Don't you all have any mercy? Hang up the call or I'll call the cops. Police?? This is Krishna here. - Can't you make out from my number? - Krishna You could've called me on my mobile. You wouldn't pick up. Which means that I am busy with my work. What is so life threatening issue for you to call the customer care? It is indeed a life threatening issue. - What happened? Any issue? - Yes Divya ditched me and is getting engaged to Rupesh. What are you saying? Our Divya did this? I can't believe it! Shall I promise infront of the altar? Why don't you all trust me? I didn't mean that. I was talking high about your love in our office. But in my office it is a matter of gossip! - I am going to die. - You fool. Why are you all staring at me? Mind your work. Not you idiot. Come home in the evening. We will discuss. No. I am not going to change my decision. I am going to commit suicide for sure. Don't keep blabbering the same thing over and over again. We will discuss in the evening at my place. No... Its love... Heart...inside... painful... You will not understand. You have now learnt about the value added tax. Would you like to know about the lifetime validity? Are you making fun? My life is at stake here. And you are talking about lifetime validity! I thought you would empathise with me. I was wrong! Hello. Hello. I trusted the doctor and called them. I must whack the doctor! My dear friend! Dude! Wait a second. Come over to the terrace. What sister? My heart lifts up in joy on uttering your name! I strive to live my life with you! Your glance showered rains in my heart. Dude! Tell me. Won't you ask me the reason for my happiness? You tell me. I got engaged today. What! - Engagement? For you? - Why are you so shocked? Did you think that I would never get a girl? Sorry! I am a bit tensed. That's why! - All the best dude! - Your wishes are filled with envy! Why is your voice so dull? Are you crying? Why? Does it sound like am laughing? Why are you crying? Divya... She left me. What? Our Divya? You both were sincerely in love! Even last month you scaled her compound wall to meet her. The making out... - All of it went waste? - Yes! Earlier the women used to cry thinking of this. But now a days, its the boys who cry! I am having a serious discussion with you and you are laughing. Sorry! It just came out. How cann you laugh? Forget it. Nobody has ever understood me. Leave it. I will not be there for your marriage. Keep the 5000 you borrowed from me as my gift. Stop talking like a fool. Won't you get any other girl. You will get a thousand girls for your personality? Am I a gigolo for women to throng me for my personality? They must like me for who I am as a person. You will get for sure. Even I am a failure in love. But now I have a better girl in my life. I will Whatsapp you the picture. Let me know your opinion. You will also find one like this. - Do you understand? - I do understand You are busy with your engagement and I think I disturbed you. All the best. Be happy always. Why are you blabbering the same thing over and over again? You know how much I was in love with her. Dude.. Please excuse me. My fiance has come to talk to me. Shall I call you later. I am telling you that am going to die and you want to enjoy with your fiance? Such a specimen! I know that you are playing around. What? So you actually thought that am cracking jokes is it? I know you. Give me ten minutes. I'll call back. Go and keep tailing your wife. Mind your language. I am atleast picking your calls now. When you were with Divya you would never pick my calls. Moreover she is going to live with me. She is not going to ditch like Divya. - So you are stressing on it. - I am sorry! What you said was right. I can make out from your language that my decision to commit suicide is right. I just blabbered out of rage. Where are you? Come over. Let's meet. How is that when you get a girl you all start insulting the friends? - She is not just another girl! - So what is she? A psycho is it? I meant that she is my fiance. All that is after marriage. What if she doesn't like your face and elopes with her ex boyfriend? How dare you! Go and die! Sorry! What happened? Why are you so tensed? Nothing. Leave it. If it is something that you must not tell me, then leave it. There is nothing like that. A friend of mine... He cannot be called as a friend. He was in love with a loser. She is getting married to someone else. He is torturing me saying that he is going to kill himself. - So the one whom you were swearing to die... - It is him! - Why did you say that? - Do you know what he said? Forget it. Whatever it is, you must not have told him to die in this kind of a situation. Why? If he commits suicide, won't it be like you asked him to die? He is committing suicide due to love failure. What can I do? How will the cops know all this? They would enquire the reason for his death.. ...check who was his last caller... ...his call recordings and everything. Moreover you have asked him to die. That's why am telling you please call him. Do you read a lot of detective novels? I don't read any detective novels. My father is a cop and I know the way he handles suicide cases. That's why am telling you please call him and talk. Not required. He will not kill himself. He will kill others! Upto you. I've told you what I have to. Switched off! Don't you have any brains Ramesh? He has called us in a confused state and you have asked him to die! Are you a learned man? Who gave you a cashier's job at the bank? Do you know what he said? You have been saying this for long? What did he really say? Please don't ask me that. Then shut up. Hey. Are you guys telling me that I am the reason if he is dead? I don't know what he is planning. But if the cops ask me I would say that. Mohideen. I will murder you! So, two murders is it? - Two murders? - Yes You have asked him to die and he will kill himself. You are planning to kill me as well. Kill him too. It will be a hatrick. If that idiot commits suicide how is Ramesh to be blamed? He is killing himself because of this guy. First lets find out if he is serious or kidding. - How? - We'll get the news in two days. Hey. I am not interested in talking to him. You tell me Mohideen. - He is not Mohideen. He is Sowmy. - He is blabbering in fear. - Stop confusing! Let's find out from his office friends. Krishna and Divya had a lot of issues for over a month. They were fine, isn't it? He even scaled her compund wall and got cozy with her! - What? - They were fine That was until Divya was transferred to the Velachery branch. After that she changed and changed her boyfriend as well. Changed her boyfriend? That's true. She is in love with the Velachery head. This is the guy. Rupesh. Rupesh? He is so horrible. Did she leave Krishna for him? How did Krishna know about this? It is so embarassing to talk about that incident. Never mind. Tell me. Am sure it must be interesting. Shut up. One more large please! Krishna. It's too much. Enough. - Only for today. - No. Enough. I am happy that I am getting a beautiful wife. Please. This is the last peg. - No. No. Enough. - Shall we dance? - Yes. Sorry dude! Bro! Yes! Can you play Actor Ajith's songs? Krishna. I need to go to the washroom. What are you doing here? Divya? Are you planning to get cozy here in the washroom? It's been a while since she went in. That's why am looking for her. She left long back. Come. Let's go. I'll just go to the washroom and come. She poured something in my mouth. Put your hand in and throw up. - It's not coming. - What is he doing here? What are you looking at? He forgot that he had a bike and walked all the way home that night. He was terribly upset. We didn't ask anything about this as it would hurt him. Looking at what you say, we are scared if he would do something. Oh my! The satan is turning towards me. Did you hear? Did you hear? Brother! He will not do anything. Share your numbers. If I comes here we will inform you. Please take note. 9840371214 The name is Ramesh. He was the one who asked him to die. What? - Please call us if you get any information. - Sure You are going overboard. I'll thump your jaw! It's burning! It's because of you! Cheers! We are from a family that serves beer to people who are thirsty. You have made me drink juice instead of beer to celebrate Ramesh's marriage. Forget it. We can have it on another occassion. When is your arrest? What wrong did I do? Why will they arrest me? It's your son... What he says is... Marriage is like a life sentence. He is asking when are you going to get arrested for that! Mohideen got the point! Fine. Your marriage is fixed. When is Krishna and Divya getting married? He will do it soon. Which one? Suicide? Be casual. - He will marry Divya, isn't it? - Yes dad. Why do you ask this? Don't tell him that I told you this. I think there are some issues between them. Earlier, Divya used to call me once a week. Now a days she doesn't. She doesn't pick my call as well. Not just that. Krishna becomes very furious if we talk about Divya. The other day when I was boozing... Hi dude! How was the party? What? Did you walk all the way? Where is your bike? You are high and you forgot it? Or did you lose it? Am asking you? I have been to the bar many times. Have I ever forgotten my bike? Hey. My friend will take it. Now what? He seems to be very hot tempered now. Let me cool him down. Chilled beer!! The best drink that my son loves! Hey, Do you have common…. Have it! No Daddy is asking you. Have it. I am very tensed. Can you leave me alone? I brought this as I know that you are tensed. Daddy's darling. Please have it. Hey, Get lost. I am saying this for your good. Have this and daddy will leave. Stop irritating! Go away! Show all your temper tantrums to me. With Divya you are very sweet! When you get whacked by her after marriage, you will come to me. I will then take care! You @$#% Even my father has not swore at me like that! But he did! I never expected this. I will just make a call. I forgot about it only a while ago and now am reminded of it again. Mohideen. You can laugh here if you want to. I will not mistake. I couldn't control. This embarassment is nothing compared to that. I am not worried that he swore at me. After his mom left him, I thought he was happy with you guys. But for the past few days he is not happy. I wished Divya was his everything. I don't think that is going to happen. I only have him. If anything happens to him... I can't even think of! Daddy. What is this! He is happy. You don't worry. When he is back on sunday let us all drink together. Next Superstar Premji! My leader Premji! Finally they made me dance for Premji's song! Didn't I tell you all to fill the tank? You all didn't listen. You said that there wasn't enough diesel. You never said that there was no diesel at all. Give me thousand bucks. - Why should I give? - Why, is it? - We are taking this risk for you? - What is the risk in filling diesel? After giving me the money. Talk what ever you want. Just said something now he is irritating. Fill up for Rs.150 and hand me over the balance Rs.850 Please check the readings. - Hello bro! - Hello! I thought of calling you and you are right in front of me. - Stop bluffing. - Seriously? I am on my way to a function with my family. I wanted to give you the school trip. Oh… ! - I wont be able to go. - Why? One of my friends said that he wants to commit suicide and went missing. Oh god ! That is all fine. Another friend just asked him to go and die. - Is he insane? - He sure is. Is he even a friend? You carry on with that work. I'll ask someone else to take care of the school trip. Did he ask you any details? Hey, I am asking you. Where he is seeing. - Let me... - Stop Mohideen. No! Rupesh let's go. Why? What happened? Krishna's friends. What are you looking at? Turn away. Hey. What ! Not here. There will be more troubles. I am telling you. Go away! Or else we'll thrash you. What? You will thrash me? I thrashed your friend Krishna yesterday. You thrashed him? Do you all want to be thrashed like that? Get down from the bike! Sowmy! Don't create unncessary issues. Everything is over between me and Krishna. We all know that eveything got over between you both. Mind your words. If one boozes and creates a ruckus, will anyone spare him? What do you expect of him when you ditch him? Why are you creating problems here with a girl. Keep all your problems at home. We know all that. You mind your business. It won't take much time for me to tell you this. But I don't feel like telling that to you. This fellow has whacked my friend. This girl is the reason for that. This issue wouldn't have happened if she was sitting as my friends pillion. Love failure! He has switched off his phone and gone to commit suicide. What ever it is don't create any problems here. You leave now. Go now. What are you staring at? Sowmy! Some more curry please. Hey, We need to find Krishna before something happens to him. - Did you find out where his number was last reacheable? - I have asked for it and we will get it in the morning. Will he commit suicide just like he said? Hey, Be a little positive. Nothing of that sort would've happened. Why will I talk negatively now, if you had been positive while talking to him? Stop it Mohideen. I will cry! Why are you pestering him? Stop it. Shall we file a police complaint? - Not required. - Why? He would get caught. It's not because of that. In every love issue, the cops always support women. Since Krishna's father does not know Krishna's timings we can manage him. We will deal the issue. - How do we deal with this? - Let's search. His bike is neither at the office nor at his house. It should be inside the city for sure. What if he had gone out of station on the bike? There is no point looking at me. Answer my question. I'll answer. He will never go on long drives on the bike. Even if he is going out of station, he would leave his bike at the parking of a Railway station or Bus Stand. We will search as told by Ramesh. Before that... When Krishna spoke to us, he would've specifically mentioned about an issue or a location. - Did he say anything of that sort? - He never said anything. Why don't you just think and answer. Let me think. I'll tell you something. Don't tell anyone else. I haven't told Ramesh and Mohideen also. Last night I scaled the compound wall of Divya's house and we made love! - What? - Twice! Oh my! Dude. I am telling this only to you. Don't tell anyone. Last night me and Divya.. What? Did you all take a selfie together? You too thought of the same thing? Same to same. We ourselves got reminded of that. He is always in that thought. What else will he get? Hey I know where he is. Hey My mothers ashes were submerged here. Whenever I feel sad, I would come here and talk alone. I would feel relaxed after that. - Mom's was here is it? - Yes. Where will it be for dad? Idiot! I must not have been serious with you. Or else? Why do you want to talk seriously while having beer? Dude, I've searched completely on the other side. He is not there. - He is not there as well. - Neither here. But we were talking here the other day. While we were talking... ...we had chilled beer as well. He even said that we all can drink together here one day. He is not here now. Why can't we try that now? Did he say that or are you cooking up? I am not talking for myself here. We are taking this risk for you. Having a beer on the beach is taking risk for my sake is it? From morning onwards iam spending the money. Mom calling. Hey Sowmy! Where are you? A friend has met with an accident. People from his house will reach only in the morning. I will stay here for the night and reach in the morning. Are we going to search all night? Why? Do you have any other work? I know why you are asking. Tell me. - Where are you? - Somewhere. Tell me what the matter is. Your son is fast asleep. When will you reach home? It does not matter at all. You also go and sleep. Fine. Be happy! I am going to die at such a young age! That too for this petty love issue! I wonder how many like me will be killed by these girls. Why do you all do this? Mom! I will be with you in a while. Dad! After mom, you are my everything. You took care of me very well ever since she passed away. I thought of living for you... She is right behind torturing me. Hey Divya! You will never have a good life after cheating me. After marriage, Rupesh will be doubtful on you and torture you. You will call for my name when he tortures you. Rupesh will be pissed off even more and torture you even more. Only then my soul will rest in peace. Time to die. - What's your name? - Kumar - Is it your own vehicle or someone else's? - It's my vehicle. Your vehicle is it? What is your address? No. 76, Vadapalani. Your dad name ? - What happened? - An accident. A car crashed on a bike. The biker died on the spot. What bike is it? Yamaha FZ. My son has the same vehicle too. - What color is it? - The green one. - Is it Krishna? - It must not be him. Let's go and check. No dude! I will faint if I see blood. Why are you asking him? Come. Please move. It must not be Krishna! Dude! Dude! Krish... Krish... Krishna... What happened to Krishna? - Krishna is dead you sinner! - Krishna? Yes! Krishna is dead? I killed him! Krishna I killed you!!! I killed him. What are you doing? The performance is good but the emotions need to better. What are you doing? That is not Krishna! Did you get fooled! Moidu.. Moidu... Don't you know when to play? Do you all know how scared I am? He is playing without understanding it. Will you hit him for that? Sorry dude! Ask him to get lost or else I'll whack him! Mohideen My time is not right from morning. I am very scared. Ramesh! Poor Krishna! Don't know what happened. Mohideen... what happened? Ramesh. Ramesh! Wake up. Ramesh. - Why did you ask me to go and die? - Krishna? You are responsible for my death! Ok forget it. No one seems to enjoy my jokes in the dead world. Can you please come with me? No I won't. What? You won't? I sacrificed my life because of you. Can't you come with me? - Please come. - No. I said come with me! - No I won't come. - Come! - Come with me! - No I won't come! Why are you screaming? What happened? What else could it be? Kirshna might have asked him to join him in the world of dead. Correct buddy! Oops sorry. I am not supposed to talk to you. - Slap me if you want. - Come on now. I apologized the whole night. I say slap me but you won't. Listen Sowmi. Sir, kindly move. - Krishna's cell phone is still switched off. - Switched off? It's Krishna's dad. I told you. Now attend it. On our way let's buy some flowers for the funeral. - Buddy! - Put it on speaker mode. - Hello. - Dear, why haven't you delivered the milk yet? Milk? This is Sowmi here. - Oh ! guess I dialled the wrong number. Asusual, I boozed a lot last night. - Sorry. - It's ok. - Sowmi... - Tell me. Where is your friend? He didn't even return home last night. - How will he return? - You mean Krishna? Who else is your friend? Actually he had called me up yesterday. He said that he is heading to Banglore for two days on an official purpose. So sir has time to call you up and update but not me. Actually his phone switched off when as he was talking to me. You just won't give up on him. Isn't it? If he keeps talking to Divya the whole time how will the mobile battery withstand? He will definitely call you soon. No way! I don't have such an obidient son. Indeed. Atleast you be obidient to your parents. - What do we do now? - What else? We'll file a complaint with the police and tell his father the truth. Let's start. I've got another work but before that I'll drop you guys off. Get in. Can't you guys hear me? To hell with you guys. So you guys are tagging along and making me look bad? That's not my intention buddy. You guys can go home and be at peace but I can't be. If suppose something happened to Krishna... then I'll carry a guilt that... I'll regret life long. This might look crazy to you guys. But if this has to stop then I must find out Kirshna and I will. You leave. Sorry to have slapped you last night. Stop highlighting the fact that you slapped me! Stop it Maideen, have some pity on him. Ramesh, you are correct. But if we have to find him we need to set a deadline. - Ok. - We'll look for him till today evening 6. Ok. Sir, why are you silent? Say something. Like you guys are going to listen to me! As far as I am concerned, looking for him is utter waste. We must be crazy to do that. I'll just follow your orders sir. I'll look for him where ever you want me to. Don't get furious. This might be completely illgocal and utter waste. Our friend is missing and we can't just deal this over phone calls. Only if we try looking for him we'll have some self satisfaction. But all this only till today evening 6. And only if you are willing. I don't have a bike. We can't take my rickshaw. Just pay me up for the diesel. Come on. Oh! Oh! I drank to forget my sorrows and... forgot to consume the poison. Over that I've spilled the poison too! Come on now! Thank god. There is a little left. Perfect time to die. It's so stuffy! How about a bath before dying? Dad always advised me to get fresh before doing any important work. That's the right way to do it. It's Sowmi. Tell me Sowmi. - Stay on the line, I'll put a conference. - Ok. I'll be back by evening. So be ready and yes don't let him sleep. Then at night he won't sleep. It's them again. Tell me. We are in a conference call. Listen to me carefully. Krishna's cell phone signal was last found in Ashok Nagar. Awesome! So that means he is around Ashok Nagar or some where else. - We must look for him all over Chennai. - Correct! Let's focus on Ashok Nagar a bit. So tell me where are you guys going to search? He was drunk when he called me yesterday. I guess he must be lying wasted in some bar. I'll go look around in the bars. I hope you are not going there to drink. - Funny! - Calm down. - I'll head to the movie theaters, beach, park and.. - And what? Beg? - Getting back at me is it? - Obviously. Ramesh what about you? I'll go to a place which you guys wouldn't even have thought of. Humans can't bathe in here. I don't care if my dad scolds me once I'm dead. Anyway I never cared when he used to scold me. If I still don't consume it... then I'm good for nothing! Oh! Oh! I'm starving. Hello. I'm calling from room number 102. - I would order a bucket chicken. - Ok sir. - And a diet cola. - Ok sir. Ok. - Hello. Hello. - Yes sir. Ensure you get me enough ketchup for the chicken. God, please save me. On whose name are you offering this? In the name of Krishna. You may many friends everywhere. But this fellow? He is a rocking friend! He is a sneaky friend! He is an unethical friend! He is a crazy friend! He is a cranky friend! In all he is a cheap friend! Roses are red and love is a sin; I don't give a damn about him! Violets are blue and monkeys are found in zoo; I can't take no more! To hell with him! Good for nothing; he is a fraud! If he approaches you, you better escape! He'll agree to everything you say. He is a show off! He is the master of crooks. I'm going to break him,crack him and bring him down I'm going to break him,crack him, kick him, skin him and I'm gonna bring him down. Roses are red and love is a sin; I don't give a damn about him! Violets are blue and monkeys are found in zoo; I can't take no more! To hell with him! He is a heartless fellow; Support him and I'll break you face. Every dog has it's day but the he'll never change! He is the master of flirting. He won't give up until he is caught! All he inflicted on us is torture; that can't be good for our future. Friend in need is a friend indeed but he is the friend always in need! We will thump him, thwart him and break his jaw! Roses are red and love is a sin; I don't give a damn about him! I desired and suffered of torment You ditched us and you killed my relationship with my friends. You made me slog for you with your mesmerizing eyes. No more do I need your kisses I have friends who shed their bloods. I will thump her thwart her and break her jaw! I will thump her thwart her and break her jaw! You can win an oscar for your acting skills! Why do you need such theatrics? We no more need your friendship You churn out lies And torment us with it We will thump him, thwart him and break his jaw! We will thump him, thwart him and break his jaw! He will not spare us even when he dies! Oh my God! He commited suicide for asking him to go for work. Each one went to one place, but I came here. Sir! Please come. There were six suicide cases yesterday. One of it is an oldie. He tried to scare his wife for not giving him any money for boozing but the knot just got tightened. There are three bodies in the age group that you asked for. One of it was got from the lake. The face has bloated and looks like a torn football. The other one is burnt. It will look as though it has psoriasis. The third one committed suicide by hanging. If you look at it... You will definitely laugh at it. Which one do you want to see first? Option A: The one from the lake Option B: The burnt one Option C: The one that hung itself. Show any of it. Welcome to 'Who wants to see a corpse!' Option A: The one from the lake. He is playing with bodies ? I think he is mental. Check if it is this. It must not be Krishna! You are very brave. Everyone who saw this face fainted. You will definitely be not deterred to see the burnt one. The second one is Option B The burnt one Check if this is the one. No! You look at it casually! I can see this face only if I have half bottle of whiskey. There is a job vacancy for the same position of mine. Would you be interested? Show me the next one. Where are you going that side. We need to go to Option C. This is Option C The one that hanged. Don't be scared. I am here. Not this one too is it? Why are you keeping your face like this? Don't fall on the corpse. May I help you? I have got all that I ordered for. This is another item. I don't understand. - I am Rishi. - So what? This is my card. O K Rishi Pleasure Agent. Oh my! Are you pimp? - Yes. - Not required Came to ! Sorry brother. Hey brother. Here Look here. Turn this side. Me? Yes. You! You only. Come here. What did you call me for? What? - Are you an auto driver? - Yes. Share auto driver. I am also a share auto driver. - Oh is it? - Yeah! That was once upon a time. I saw you at Valsarawakkam bar and then at Nesapakkam bar. You are now loitering at this bar. - Are you trying to get free booze? - Not at all. We must never lie among boozers. Here. Have it. Not at all. One of my friend is missing after love failure. That's why I am searching if he is drunk in any bar. Love failure is it? Yes I am sure that he is definitely here somewhere. He is so depressed that his friend is missing that he is not drinking! If it was for you all You all will drink in sadness if I go missing isn't it? Didn't you leave to search? I don't want hot drinks. Beer is fine. I was wrong in giving him a conduct certificate. - Give him that beer. - Have it. I have some work. I'll have it in my house. You drink anywhere. Do you have a picture of your friend who went missing? Show me. Here I think I saw him somewhere last night Where did you see him? Wait. Let me think. Dont rush. Where did we see him? He was creating a ruckus after boozing. I kept him at Ramasubbu's godown. It is him. This is not him. - It is him. - Yes. You are right. Yes it is him. - Is there an issue? - Nothing. He hit his child after boozing. I had to stop him and kept him at the godown. He is not like that. He must not have done it in his senses. Please spare him. You are now close to me. Moreover you drive a share auto. Let's release him. Hire an auto. When we have an auto why do you have to get another one? I never expected this from you. Just fill in the diesel. I never expected this too from you. You've taken a picture with Actor Ajith? - Are you his fan? - Yes I am also his fan. - Wonderful - Thanks Let's go. Love you! Why is sister calling? - Sister - Sowmy Tell me Mom just fainted. - What happened? - Nothing. She is fine. Looks like low blood pressure. Can you take her to the hospital? I'll be there in a while. Do you get water in your loo? - I am not getting it in my room. - So? If you give me place for me to attend to my nature's call... I will never forget you for life. Hey! Go out. I too thought of the same. But it is very hard to clean after that. I asked you to go out of the room. You look learned. Can't you read the 'Do not disturb' sign on my door? I can see that there is a sign on the door. But I don't know what is written on it. Sorry to disturb. What is the meaning of Do not disturb? Leave before I swear at you. Where do I go now! I wanted to commit suicide in peace. Looks like he would torture and kill me. All girls are bad. All of them are cheaters. Are boys any good? Who is true in love these days? You all want to pass time with us. Time pass is for us or for you? Fine! Fine! We are discussing on who is more affected in love? Is it men or women? More than what we debate about it, we have a chief guest in our studio... It is very suitable if he says this. He is the one who mocked about love and lovers in recent films. Let's welcome, the one and only... I will not say that.. You take a look. Welcome Santhanam! Welcome. We are debating if it is men or women the most affected in love. Have you experienced love? Am I from another planet or what? I am human too. I am sure all of us would've experienced love. Your decision in this debate will be crucial. Please take your seat. A girl would like to ask you a question. Can you tell us about your love experience? Do you have a boyfriend job if I have ten years experience? We are the most affected in love... We have lost everything due to love.... Is there anyone who says these? Gopi That question must not be asked that side. It should rightfully be asked this side. Sorry Santhanam! Sorry! Tell us. I truly loved a girl. Finally she cheated me and went with someone else. If you love truly they will definitely cheat you. If you try to ditch them, they will never leave you. Yes. That's right. You always support the boys? No no. There is nothing like that. I just told the fact and unfortunately it is favouring them. There is general thought in boys... They say that they can't understand a woman's heart. A woman's heart is unfathomable. What is your opinion? I must say that boys who say that are not updated yet. We can find out what is in a woman's heart by looking at her Whatsapp status. How do you say that? If a girl's status is available... It means any one can propose to her. If its 'Feeling Irritated' it means that the girls lover is with another girl. What if it is 'Feeling lonely'? It means that there is no one at home. Please come fast. Looks like you will run after the shoot. Oh my! She had the status yesterday. Tell us if this is right. It is very true. Our whatsapp status reflects what's in our mind. Pass the mic There is nothing like that. Pass the mic above. It is true. When your intelligence is hijacked by the hormones Love is not settling in the body system. So during love failure What is your state of mind? - I cried locking up the door. - You look like a cry face. Pass it above. I cut my veins. He must have slashed it. Look at how she lies. We feel like slapping every man in our sight. Come, I'll slap you. You tell me. I burnt all the gifts and greeting cards, took a video of it and sent it to her. I was piss drunk when I called her and sweared at her. She didn't bother after swearing at her in public. I never went out of the house. Didn't go for work either. He is my type. I never fell in love. I came here to talk about my friend's love. One of my friends was sincerely in love with a girl. She is infact related to him. No one knows what reason it is. She cheated and left him alone. He couldn't handle the depression. He committed suicide. We were with him. But couldn't save him. All our friends now miss him a lot. Santhanam Most of the love that starts happily ends in such a tragedy. What is your opinion about it? He said that he misses his friend. He has missed such a good friend in his life. When we watch a program in television Are we crashing the TV if we don't like the program? Are we not changing the channel? So when there is a problem in life, we must not destroy ourselves. We must look for other good things. Listen to what I am saying carefully. The one who dies for having missed a girl... or the one who kills that girl is not a man. One who lives his life in a way that the girl feels that she missed him is a true man. Well said Santhanam. Well said. Brilliant! Let me tell something to both the sides. As far as love is concerned, take care of it when it comes to you. If it goes away, don't care. Enjoy every second of your life. The meaning of life is to live. Live happily. Super! Whatever may be the problem in love, this is the most suitable solution to it. This applies to both sides. We will meet you again with another enjoyable topic. This is Badava Gopi signing off with Star Santhanam. The one who dies for having missed a girl... or the one who kills that girl is not a man. One who lives his life in a way that the girl feels that she missed him is a true man. I am back. The tyre is punctured. Punctured? Auto Drop me at Adayar. Please come. This time it's going to be a sixer. END BEEP You are out!! You are out!! Don't you all have any brains? Didn't you all get any better place to play? Get hold of him! He is running away snatching a gold chain. To your right. Stop. - You ride very well. - Thanks. Vimal. Go and fetch Ramasubbu. His wife wouldn't send him if I call thinking that I am calling him to booze. - You please call him. - Didn't realise that such a problem existed. She wouldn't send him even if I called him. What do we do now? Brother. I will go and call him. You just said what I thought. Listen Go straight then take a left and then right. You will find a board naming V.Ramasubbu, Secretary. - Fine - Wait. When you call him, tell him that Duraipandi called. He will come. Fine. Brother, Listen completely and then go. Don't ask anything about your friend because he is the one your friend whacked. - Fine. - So just bring him here. - I will take care of the rest - Fine Durai bro - What is that? - I just shortened your name. He is such a fool. Whatever I thought you are just saying it. You are my buddy! Go and fetch him. I will take care of the rest. Victory is ours! Feels like someone who's seen it - Hey Nancy! - Don't shout. Shut your mouth. Why are you doing this? - You will neither tell her nor will you let me tell her. - It will create unnecessary issues. - Peter loves you. - Please love him too. Why do you embarrass me in public. - She might mistake me - She will like it only we if tell like this. Shut up and come. You guys have no other work? You guys will propose a girl. Then when she leaves you, you all will want to die and torture your friends. That is Krishna's bike. Hey! Hey! Stop there right now. Someone is calling us from behind. - Who is it? - The one with the spectacles. He looks like this girls brother. What? Brother? Let's get away from him. - Which is Ramasubbu's house? - That one. I want to meet Mr. Ramasubbu Dear! Someone has come in search of you. - Greetings - Who are you? Duraipandi has come to meet you. - Oh is it? - Yes This is why I asked you not to shout. Go faster. He is near us. Go faster! Go faster. Oh my! It's dried up! What? It's dried up! I am sorry dude. We will meet in the evening near your house. Hey stop! Don't run! I was not the one who was ogling at your sister. It was him. Shut up! From where did you all steal the vehicle? Stole? Can't you make out from my dress code? I am a mechanic. The bike was not in good condition. We thought of checking the bike while looking out for his girl. He ran away and I got caught. Who gave the bike for service? Nobody came and gave. I took it from Ananda lodge. I am going to give it back there. I can't find Duraipandi! He was here. I can't find my auto as well. Probably he has gone to have tea. He will be back. Ramasubbu... Where are you going? Duraipandi called me. It's been a week since he is out of town. When did he call you? He says that it's been a week since he is out of town. May be he doesn't know. He came along with me a while ago. Why are you all confusing? - Just a moment. - You are confusing us. The auto is here. Can you see him coming? Why are you trusting what he says? I've brought Ramasubbu as you said. Go fast! Go fast! Catch him! Ramasubbu! Ramasubbu! Ramasubbu! Ramsubbu! Ramsubbu! My auto! Hey! My auto! See you bye!!!! Will you always be late after lunch? Where do they give you an hour break for lunch? If you continue this go can go to your native. They would be tensed even when they are normal. Now they are already tensed! Go and clean room no.105 Who are you? My friend is staying here. Fine! Fine! Hey! Just a moment. Has anyone taken a room in the name of Krishna? Why are you asking me this? There is a guy with a white shirt below who can answer your question. It's a little personal. I am already tensed. Go and ask in the reception. Just a moment. - I can ask in the reception. - Tell me brother. What is it? Have you seen this guy? Oh my! Our friend! He is here. He was completely drunk yesterday. He was enjoying KFC, Tandoori and Biriyani! His name is not Krishna. Isn't it Ramesh? Ramesh? He has booked the room in the name of Ramesh. He has been using my name everywhere. - Room number? - 102 Thanks - Give me the cash. - Here, take it! Careful! Nothing will happen. Hey! Look at us! Careful! Come out! Come out! It's open is it! I didn't have the time for tea due to this fellow. He has been having KFC bucket chicken... Thalappakatti Biriyani! Where is this fellow? Oh! Your highness is showering is it? He is inside. Vanathi! Our marriage will happen! Sir please! Just a moment sir! - Won't you listen to me? - The minister is on the phone. I can't talk to anyone. - Get away! - Sir please! Keep searching all the rooms. Don't spare any room. You are caught today! Come out! Come out! - You are caught now! - What is the hurry now? Who are you? Oh my! It's not me! We are caught now! Uncle! How much is it? Sowmy said that he has gone to Bangalore and that he would return only after two days! I thought he was a fraud. Looks like all his friends are frauds as well. Please keep the change. Daddy! Good morning! Why are you watering the plants? Sumathi aunty is out of town. Looks like he is in a good mood. Carry on! I won't be bothered. Don't spoil our leader's song! The music director might just whack you. Son! Listen. Why did you do it? Did you do it for money? Then? Is it vengeance? Who are the ones who accompanied you? Don't hide the truth. Spill it. Or else I will have to use other methods to investigate. Should I throw all the food in the dustbin? You are doing it everyday! Why do you ask today? Won't you ask why I never returned home yesterday? Why? Won't you inform me when you are going out? Am I your father or are you my father? You are my father. Thank God! Yesterday... ... I almost committed suicide. You say that in a very casual way! Divya cheated me and is getting married to someone else. I was depressed. That's why I thought of committing suicide. I now realised that it is a great mistake. She was the reason for swearing at you the other day. My mind is now very clear. We'll booze together tonight. Fine.. Did you inform anyone that you are committing suicide? Mohideen, Sowmy and Ramesh. I told all of them. Nobody bothered. Ramesh asked me to go and die! I will never talk to them again. You fool! - Don't you know your limits? - Why? When they came yesterday and said unnecessary things, I knew that you were up to something. Moreover Ramesh would call every minute.. ...and torture me asking what I was doing every minute. Call and inform them that you are back home. They might be searching for you. Suicide it seems! I must commit suicide for giving birth to you! Aren't you the only one for your wife and child? Don't you have to save them? Tell me. I don't know anything. I promise. They cheated me saying that they would take me to my friend. Why do you keep repeating the same thing? Stop it! Tell me your friend's number. 9884552885 His phone is switched off. We will take care of that. It's not ringing isn't it? You would never listen to me. It's not ringing is it? Can you hear? This is not the phone ring. It's your death bells ringing! Did you hear it nicely? Is it Krishna? Yes. Who is it? I am the inspector from R3 Ashok Nagar police station. The one who drives share auto, Mohideen... - Is he your friend? - Why? - Come immediately to the police station. - Police station? - Is there an issue? - Will you come only if you know it? Please come. Sir. I'll be there sir. Oh god! So hot. You tried to commit suicide. Yes sir! You went in search of him? Yes sir. A guy got you caught by telling you that he would lead you to him. Yes sir. Exactly. I get so worked up when I hear all this. How tensed would the judge be, it he gets to know this? But that's the truth. Do you have any vengeance against him? - He is my close friend. - You almost closed him! The one who died has given a statement that he was the one who fetched him. His wife is the eye witness. If I release him... ... the sidekicks of the one who died are waiting to murder him. The case is strong against him. I cannot do anything. Take him to the magistrate. Go now. Don't worry. I will take you out on bail. - Get me out as soon as possible. - Sure. Only then I can kill you as soon as I come out. What is all this bruises? Don't cry. Don't cry! Manohar. Please leave her at her mother's place. I won't go. I know that you will be back tomorrow. I will stay at our house only. Shall I take sister to my place? Can you please shut up? Whatever you have done is enough! Daddy! Did you inform others that you are not dead yet? I called them but their numbers were switched off. Please inform them. They are still searching for you. Why is it locked? - Who are you? - Is Sowmy not around? - They are at the hospital - Hospital? What happened? Sowmy met with an accident a while ago. - Accident? Which hospital? - MK Hospital - Where is the ICU? - Go straight and take a left. Mom! Krishna! He wanted to take me to the hospital. Now he is admitted here! - Please do not cry! - What do I do! What are you doing mom? Please don't cry! Calm down! The doctor said that he is out of danger. Please sit down. - Please sit down. - Just a moment please. If you stay here she will keep crying. Please go visit him and come. I'll take care of her. Please carry on. Brother. Yes. - He will not be able to talk. - What are you saying? Due to the accident, something in his mouth... They said something. I didn't understand. It will take a month it seems. We didn't inform his mother. You too take care of it. Fine. I'll take care. Thanks. Did you do a facial? Did you take a look at him? Yes. The hospital bill is not paid. We cannot be asking mom in this situation. Don't worry! I will take care of it. Yes. How much is the bill for Patient Sowmy? Oh my God! Ramesh! Why did you do this? Krishna - Oh my! - Krishna You have come already to pay the bill for your friend! Why did you do this when you have such good friends? Why did you drink the solution that I had for cleaning the toilets? Rs.25000 sir. - Are you paying it now? - Just a moment. There is another case. I will pay for both. Ok sir. Ramesh! Krishna is here. Take a look. Carefull ! Nothing will happen. What happened? My son has told me clearly what has happened. He has gone in search of his friend. He did not know anything about that girl. Oh Can I keep informing this to all the police men who come for the wedding? Listen. I told you the other day that my son in law should be a man of character. Why do you keep saying the same thing over and over again. I have brought up my son in a good manner. - Give your girl only if you trust. - I can't trust and that's why I am talking this long. Fine. Leave it then. I will get him married to a better girl. - What is the problem with my girl? - So is my son having an issue? - What business does he have in a lodge before marriage? - What were you doing at the lodge? Dad He has told already isn’t it? Why is he talking like this? You get your daughter married off to someone as per your wish. Oh my God! After he said no the prostitute... I don't want anything. Leave. Why did you close the door? Though he is a pimp wasn't he decent in his approach? Do you have that decency? We should live the way we want at the same time give what we can to others as well. That family will eat it's next meal because of you. Go and call him back. Oh my! He has left! Bro I am here. Thank God you are here. I thought you must've left. I know that how much ever fast you close the door, you would reopen it much faster. Tell me. - What are your expectations? - Well... Nice one... I don't know how to say. Do you have any pictures? After he changed the decision to commit suicide... Were you not waiting for us? You opened the door before we could ring the bell. Sir is our customer. Greet him. - Greetings - Get inside. Wait for a moment. - I wanted to call you and inform.. - Tell me. What is it? Can we cancel the program? Oh my god! My family will eat with the money that you are going to pay me. If you cancel the program... ..then the entire family has to commit suicide. I never agreed for any other program! Brother please ask her to stop crying. Don't cry! Who is that? It's me. Why are you doing this? Either you die or torture and kill others. You decided to commit suicide when a girl cheated you. Why do you want to cheat this innocent aunty? How is this justified? What is wrong with the aunty? Isn't she gorgeous? A girl's curse is very worse! Then it is up to you! Fine! Fine! Give me fifteen minutes time. I will go home, refresh and come back. - You will come for sure, isn't it? - You can see that my bags are here. I will be back for sure. He got caught is it! If only I get hold of the guy whom he went in search of.... I will butcher him for sure. Sir! I need someone to help the patient. Someone who is brave, please come inside. They want someone brave. You go inside. Please hold his legs. Don't feed him anything for two hours. I will come and see him after that. Aren't you ashamed? You've tried to commit suicide for a girl. Won't you get another girl? Did you think of your parents? Are we friends not there for you? Shameless! I am ashamed to call you as my friend. You idiot! You did everything and are you blaming us? I am lying on the bed that you should be on! Some tube is three feet down my nose. Are you advising me? Who told you to stop this proposal? I know why he went to the lodge. Should I get married according to your wishes? I want to get married to him only. Or else I will stay like this. Shut up! Who is it? I am... Can I come inside? You are already inside. Tell me now. I am Krishna. I am Ramesh's friend. Please get out of the house. I don't want to listen to any stories. I knew that you would shut the door if I talk about him. That's why I came inside. Give me five minutes. I will tell you whatever I have to. - I will not disturb you after that. - Will you get out now or should I put you behind bars? Why do you show off too much? I am being patient as you are the father in law of Ramesh. - Rightfully, you should be put behind bars. - What? You will put me behind bars? - What did I do? - Do you know what he did because of you? Oh my! What did he do? You are here! He didn't do anything. He will be fine. You please relax. If you don't mind can I hold you. Sir. What you did is it? Do you what my friend did because of you? - He committed suicide? - What he attempted suicide? Dad, I told you already. You never listened to me! Did you trust me when I told about him? What am I going to do without him? - Let me also die. Leave me. - What? You too want to die? I know that you would do like this. That's why I was holding your hands. Enough! No body must commit suicide because of me. I am the reason for everything. I was the one who was in the room and called for that girl. The only mistake he did was that he came in search of me. He is truly a good man. He is better than both of us. Don't you realise it when he attempted suicide for your daughter? I would like to tell you one last thing... If he wanted to rehearse before marriage, why should he get a room in the lodge? He could've come here when you are not around. What do you think? I know that I am always right. Why are you all staring at me? I think I spoke wrongly! Sorry! I didn't know how to explain. Then it is up to you. Brother. I'll also come along with you. Son.. Which hospital is he admitted at? END BEEP Brother How long will you keep crying? Eat first I am not hungry brother. Everyone who comes to the prison says that he is not hungry. Most of them start arguing after a week saying that the food is not enough. Listen, neither parents are not here to feed you if you don't eat... ...nor is your wife here to tell you that she also will not eat if you don't eat. Get used to how you have to live here. Nothing is going to change if you don't eat. Eat now. How many of you all were involved in the murder? I didn't do anything. Don't tell me the stories that you told the cops. I swear that I didn't do it. Did they bring you here for fun? It's all my time. Amazing story! Note it down. Ok brother. Plan on how to do your next murder without getting caught instead of just eating and sleeping here. If I take class with victims like him, you all will become tactical murderers. How did he look like? One of them made me trust him with his speech. He was dark with curly hair. Did he have curly hair or was it a wig? Finding the rock. Hair come back to go. - It looked like a wig. - Then? His mustache was twitched. Was it real or was it fake? Looks like it was fake too. Then it is him. - Do you all realise who it is? - Who is it? Black Rock. Remember the guy who used to simply blabber. Brother. That black guy ? Do you know him? He is my friend. Even his mother wouldn't trust him. How did you trust him? He said he was Actor Ajith's fan! Look at how he has lied to him. He is a fan of Mansoor Ali Khan! Give the phone. Here. How many times did I tell you not to keep your phone there? - Sorry! - Please call him. Wait. Oh phone! - Hello - Hello. Who is it? This is Manali Sundar here. - How are you? - Chuck the formalities. Whom did you kill yesterday? A guy named Ramasubbu. His party men wanted to kill him. I finished him off. I escaped and am in our area only. There is so much fun to it. I planned it with a scapegoat. Poor fellow. He was caught and is now behind bars. He is now with me. - Would you like to talk to him? - Oh is it? Give it to him. I'll talk to him. Your partner wants to talk to you. - Hello - Hey brother. How are you? Did you get your lost friend? What did I do to you? Why did you get me caught? - Come and surrender. - Surrender? I have already got the advance for three more murders. My wife and child is crying. Come and surrender. Only then will I be released. Hey, To spend time with your wife, you can spend time in the jail. - My dear Micheal.. - It's Mohideen Oh a muslim is it? Bhai! They are all good people. Eat well and be happy. You can play snakes and ladders with them. Fine? - Bye! - Hello! Hello! If you smell..... ...what the rock... ...is... ...cooking! Hello! Hello! - Did he hang up? - Yes. Let me go and inform the cops. He is dreadful. He has people to finish you off inside the prison. Will he finish me off? Let me see who is finishing me off. You are in fact looking at him. Is it you? Who else? You want to inform the cops? They themselves know who is behind this murder. Listen carefully. A good man will always cheat another good man. But a murderer like me will never get at loggerheads with another murderer. Shut up and sleep. Go and cry that side. Get his number we can use it. Let's go. What is all this? I know. They informed me. Welcome back dude! Thanks! How? Rupesh? You take rest. I'll be back. - How is it? - Nice. I got it imported from the US. He is lying blatantly after getting it from the bazaar. Krishna. When did you go to the US? Show me your passport. Why are you all so shocked as though you are watching the film Conjuring? Relax I can make out from your face that you are scared of me. I went to your house to whack you and they said that you would be here. You are here! Fine. Listen. Just ten minutes. I’ll whack you and go on my way. Listen... - I whacked you... - Yes - Your friends whacked me for that - Yes they did. It's over then. We could've stopped with that isn't it? Then why did you hit my friend after that? - Why are you hitting him? - Then you take the whacking. Oh my! She is hurt if I hit you... ...and you are hurt if I hit her is it? If it hurts for people like you who have been in a relationship for ten days... Even after ten days of argument, my friend would still embrace me on the eleventh day... How much hurt would I be when you hit such a friend? Krishna, spare him. Isn't the problem between both of us? What did Sowmy do? Why did you all hit him? What are you saying? I don't know any of these. - What happened to Sowmy? - Oh my! You are too confident You think that I would believe whatever you say? It all ended the day I saw you in the restroom with him. Having a relationship with someone else after marriage is not the only thing that is illegal. When you give hope to someone else when you are already in a relationship is also illegal. Earlier I would feel like writing poetry when I see you. When I see you now, I feel like writing ten beep songs and releasing all at a time. I will have to keep walking to the court after that! I attempted at suicide for you... I am fool! Not just me. Anybody who attempts at suicide for lost love is a fool indeed. I spare you as Sowmy is out of danger. Or else I would've just crushed you. I will never come in your sight At least he is loyal to him. Krishna one minute. If I explain as a girl on why I changed like this... ... would even more embarrass me. I don't like to talk about it. I was not as sincere as you were in love. Sorry! All the best. Just see what I do to him. Let me call my men. Face him one on one like him if you are a man. Don't use your men. Don't you do anything without informing me. Mom. Please don't cry. A remanded accused can be taken on bail only after ninety days. If he has to be acquitted of this case... ..the murderers have to surrender and state that your friend is not involved in this. Meet your friend tomorrow at the prison. You can go inside to see them and sign them Just say anything. Mohideen. Mohideen.. Here... Look here. Why did you bring him? - What? - Why did you bring him here? I will butcher him when he comes out. He is asking why did you bring me along. - Shall I wait outside? - Just a moment. Don't you know what to talk? Don't you have any sense? Will you ask him to leave or not? - I will wait outside. - Just a moment. He is angry on me. You talk to him. If he doesn't leave I will go inside. Say it aloud. Noushad... Noushad... - He is sleeping. - He will sleep only now? He is sleeping in this noise? He will wake up wen we both talk in low tones in our house. Can you please shut up? Brother. You please don't mistake. He just said all that in anger. That's fine. I would've done the same thing if I was in his position. Did he say anything? Some body named Karuppu Rock is the one who murdered it seems. He wanted to inform the cops.. But his men inside the prison have threatened to kill him. Karuppu Rock? Did he tell you anything about his place? He did say. It's not easy to go to that place. Most of the people here are criminals. Each of them have around 10-15 cases registered on them, including me. Who is Meena? A female gangster? I said it is ME If you are looking at evacuating your tenants, I can do it at a cheap price for you. - I will definitely call you. - He has come in search of Rock. Is something on my face? Can you keep your mouth shut? Hi dude! Yes you scar-face! What's the matter? Where is brother? He is in the loo. - When did he go? - When he felt like going. It's a very lame joke! Why do you all do this when we come to meet him for an important issue? Nice travel. - Greetings - What is it? The lawyer sent him regarding evacuating the tenants. Why? Won't the gentleman talk? Come. Close up. Remember the murder at Nesapakkam... The guy who got caught in that.. Mohideen.. I am his friend. If you come along with me he will be released. I spoke to the lawyer and he agreed. I will give you any amount... Please don't look at me like that. I don't know anything about it. He told me about evacuating his tenants. I don't know anything. Where are you going? How much do you have? There is one lakh in this. Keep this as the advance. Shall I pay you the remaining when you surrender? Take the left and then the right. You will find the main road. Run away. That's too round about. If we go straight you can reach the main road. Why are you being arrogant? Why are you making fun of him? Bind them. I will have my food and then butcher them. Please come. My friend is innocent. Please do listen to me. - Brother.. Kali's men have surrounded here. You loafer. Please run! Run! Run! God has given us a chance. Run away and don't you come in my sight. Kill him Where Are You going Where Are You going I am sorry Stop Hey where did he go? Why are you all just following me? Surround him. Go fast, Ok brother Hey you go there. Brother! - Thank you very much. - It's ok brother. Hey! - Please leave me. - Please come to the police station. I thanked you for saving me. And you call me to the police station. I will butcher you. They are waiting to butcher you and you run around in your undies. How are you going to butcher me? - Someone will spot us. - That's why I am telling you to come to the other side. It's very tickling. Let me see how you are running away. Instead of getting married at the right time, why do you all do this! That too in front of my house. I wonder what beings you all are! What did you do to her? Why is she scolding you? I am said to be the best gangster here. But you have given me the image of a slut! Brother. Hey, Where is he? - We can't find him anywhere. - Go and search for him. Where did he go? How will I save Mohideen! Oh my! - Oh my! You are here. - Go away! You are playing hide and seek is it! - I got you! - Go away without making any noise. Thank god I found you. Imagine if they had found you. I don't mind them finding me. - I am scared when you look at me. - Come let's go to the police station. - You go. I am not coming. - If you don't come out, I will come in. You embarrassed me in an open space. If you come inside, it will be all over the papers tomorrow. Let me come out. There he is. They are coming. I don't fear all this. If I decide once, I will never change my decision. They would kill us by the time you finish your dialogue. Brother! Brother! - Look down. - What are you doing here? You got me hit on the post and you search for me? Did you come to save me or kill me? You are such a gangster. Can't you even watch out for the lamp post? Hey, I was born and raised here. Don't I know to watch out! When you see a post will you go straight ahead to it? Shouldn't you be going around it? Say it again? Why can't you go around the post when it is in your path? - You asked me to come the other way. - Me? Did I? - Yes! - Oh my God! You are such a liar. I don't lie! - Ask anyone in this area. - Can we ask him? They will butcher us. - Let's go to the police station then. - I am not coming. You go. Brother. Oh my god.

Brother. Where am I? You are at the place where you sent us. Ramesh? Sowmy Where is Mohideen? Is he not out of jail? I pleaded that black Rock to surrender. Oh my! Mohideen! Mohideen! Don't overact. Look how he acts knowing that am here. There are stitches only at two places. For him it is only two places where it is not stitched. - He is so silent. - How did you get out of the prison? Did he surrender? Hey, - He considers going to jail as an insult and you embarrassed him. - What happened? What happened is it? It seems people have started talking about you and him. - What did you do? - Forget it. It's all for our good. A lady named Sandhya has come to meet you. Who is it? Sandhya... Please ask her to come. Ok sir! He asked you to come inside. Thank you. I want to talk to him personally. Please wait outside. Why is she asking us to go out? - Go out then. - Go on. He is going. Just get out. Wait. Doesn't he have to carry his attached bathroom and all? Take and come. Why did she ask us to go out? Why do you ask me? How will I know? But, I've seen her somewhere. See. He is also agreeing. I had to talk something personal with him. That's why I asked you all to wait outside. Sorry. You all may go in now. Bye ! thanks. Hey, Who is she? Her name is Sandhya. Divya's cousin. She works in Bangalore. I've met her twice with Divya. Didn't I tell you that she was familiar? Why did she come here? I'll tell you. Look here. I came to tell you two things. First one... I am sorry for what Divya has done to you. At the same time I am happy as well. Because I was the one who first loved you. But before I could propose, Divya proposed. I knew that you both would break up. But I never thought that you would break up like this. Anyway, I still love you. You have time till you get discharged. Decide and let me know. Another thing. I wouldn't ditch you like Divya. Let's get married soon. Fine? Fine. Bye. Take care. Bye! What are you going to tell her? - Shall I tell you all something? - Spill out. If I had seen Sandhya before Divya I would've fallen in love with Sandhya. Whenever she accompanied Divya... I always felt that she is the perfect match for me. But see how God took away Divya and gave Sandhya to me. God exists, isn't it Mohideen? God does exist. You say that it is Divya's cousin. Same blood. What if she cheats just like Divya? No, no, no. She won't cheat like that. What if she does? If she does, then I will commit suicide for sure! You will call us then, isn't it? Are you all doubting me? Who else is there for me? Who else will I call? I have only you all. I will definitely tell you all before I commit suicide. Of course you will die. You are going to die. You will die for sure. Hey why you are comming close? Are you getting ready for the second part? Game over. All that you've done for us is not enough? Hey leave me, Don’t beat me.
