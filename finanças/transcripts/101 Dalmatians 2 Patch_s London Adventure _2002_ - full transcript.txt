(PUPPIES BARKING) (PUPPIES BARKING FEROCIOUSLY) PONGO: It seems like such a short time ago that my pet and I were just lazing about in our little London flat, living the humdrum bachelor life and wishing things weren't so very, very dull. That's my pet, Roger. My name's Pongo. You remember, I'm the one with the spots. (BARKING) Oh, goodness! (LAUGHING) No, no, not that one. Or that one. (LAUGHS) That's me, living my new life as a family man. (LAUGHING) Never a dull moment. I guess I got my wish. (ROGER WHISTLING) (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHS) I think I'm seeing spots!

PONGO: Yes, tomorrow would be moving day. Only one more night in this little flat, which was getting smaller by the minute. I mean, even I was beginning to feel a bit smothered. Really, it was easy to see how one of our puppies could feel, well, just a little bit lost in this sea of spots. Ah, hello, Patch. Hello, Mother. (CHUCKLING) Watching the television, are we? Yes. Well, I've got to save my spot, now, don't I? It's the best spot, after all! But you know your show doesn't start until after... NANNY: Dinnertime! (ALL GASP) Oh, dear. Oh, not again!

And best of all, we'll be miles away from that evil, ugly monster... Cruella De Vil! Now, please let me in! (GRUNTING) I can't do that, Miss de Vil. But, Mr. Fitzweil, please, something, anything. You know very well that the terms of your probation don't allow me to sell you any more furs. Not even a stole, a muff, a pair of mittens? No! One mitten? No!

Darkness and light, form and content. And what else? Chaos and order, joy and pain. And there is more than that? The possibility of triumph, the certainty of defeat, the culmination of all I've ever reached for but could not grasp! (LAUGHING) I see everything! I see absolutely everything! (GASPS) I feel faint in the presence of such artistic truth. Where is the artist? I simply must meet him! But you already have. I am Lars and I am an undiscovered genius. My name is Cruella De Vil, and I'm an over-financed heiress. Your passion for my work both repels and attracts. (CHUCKLES) Could you bear the sweet agony of seeing more? (GASPS) You mean there's more? (GASPS) Spots! Spots! Spots! Spots! I had yet to find anyone who truly understood their bleak, but beautiful meaning. That is, until I met you. This could be it! This could be the cure for my craving! My analyst said I should find something to substitute for my magnificent obsession. (LAUGHS) Who needs furs when I can soothe my tortured soul with art? Something tortures you? Tell me, what cloud dares cast a shadow on the flower? Oh, it's a sad but familiar tale of loss and disappointment, probation and a restraining order. But you, you can help Cruella to forget all that. Will you do a painting just for me, to ease my pain? I will create a masterpiece, if you will be my muse. (EXCLAIMS) Oh, darling.

I guess just one more time couldn't hurt. (ALL SIGHING) Golly, I'm good. Hello, boys! Thunder! Lightning, little buddy. (PANTING) It's just awful! I overheard what they're planning for the next episode! (GROWLS) (THUNDERBOLT CHUCKLES) Don't be too harsh on them, little buddy. I know we don't have the best writers in television, but we can always improvise. I'm pretty good at improvising, as long as it's written down for me. No, no, you don't understand. Something really horrible is going to happen. Don't tell me. Let me guess. The dam breaks? No. The mine collapses? No. Do I get an evil twin? I've always wanted an evil twin! No! Listen, Thunder, what happens is you... You... You die. (GASPS) I don't believe it. I die? Oh, Lightning, this is just about the greatest thing ever! (LAUGHS) I've always wanted to play a big death scene! The selfless hero who sacrifices himself to save the innocent. (LAUGHS) I'll kick bigger than Old Yeller! So, how do I make my shockingly unexpected and triumphant return? You don't. What do you mean, I don't? You don't make a shockingly unexpected and triumphant return. You die. You're dead. You never come back. Not even for a reunion show? Not even for a cameo in the remake. (GASPS) They're writing me out of the show? They're gonna replace you with a younger dog. So that's what those auditions were really all about! Lightning, you've gotta help me! I can't end up on the street, homeless, foraging in trash cans. Mange! I could get mange! Well, I... I did have this one crazy thought. Or ticks! I hate ticks! They suck all the blood out of you. Do you hear me? They suck all the blood out of you. What if you went out and did something heroic, like you do on the show, but in the real world? You know, get your name in the paper. Prove to them that you still got it! Wait a minute. What if I went out and did something heroic in the real world? Or that could work, too. After all, you are the One-of-a-Kind Wonder Dog. How hard could it be? Yeah, it'll be a catwalk. Cakewalk. Precisely! I'll just go get a little press for doing some easy hero stuff and they'll be begging to keep me on the show! But, first, I'll have to figure out a way to sneak past my adoring public. Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak. Hide. (LAUGHS) Master of disguise. (LOUDLY) Hi, Thunderbolt! I'm sorry, I'm... You've got the wrong dog, kid. (LAUGHS) I know it's you. That's the same disguise you used in episode 18, "Gambling Gophers of Gunfire Gulch." For howling out loud! Now you've blown my cover. This is champion! I'm your biggest fan, Thunderbolt! I know every episode by heart! Remember the time when you fought that grizzly bear and rescued those orphans and then the dam broke? And... And... Hey, aren't you the squeaky toy? Yeah. That's me. Listen, pup... Patch. Pooch, whatever. You've gotta understand. Sometimes danger and I like to dance alone! (CAT MEOWS) Good gracious gravy, look at that! A cat is stuck up in that tree! He is? Oh, my heart goes out to the poor helpless creature. Now, if I were me, what would I do? Well, I'd read the script, that's what I'd do. (GASPS) Oh, no, I don't have a script! (HYPERVENTILATING) This is just like when Tommy was trapped on that cliff in episode 29. Okay, okay, don't panic. That one was a classic. You can do this. You can do this. Only it's also like episode 64. You can't do this. You can't do this. When he was drowning in the water tower. Yeah, that was great. Who am I kidding? I have no idea what I'm doing! But episode 29 was still the best, at least from the first season. Pooch! Patch. Whatever! I'm trying to panic here! Sorry. I just thought you were going to do what you did on Raccoon Ridge. You know, when you got that barrel? And rolled it next to the cliff? Then you found a long plank of wood? And got a great big round boulder, and then... Precisely! Whoa! Hang on, little kitty! Help is on the way! (CHUCKLES) The press is going to love this. (SNARLS) (YELPS) (SIGHS) (SHRIEKS) There you are, my good man. No need to thank me. The look on your face is thanks enough! Now, smile for the cameras! Hey, that's strange. Where are all the photographers? The press is always around when I do something. What's the matter with you English people? Are you all having tea? How am I supposed to get my job back if you're all having tea? That was champion, Thunder! Just like on the telly! You know, this stuff isn't as easy as it looks! I mean, maybe if I could remember what happened in every episode of the show, you know, like Squeaky Toy, here, well, then I could... Hey, Squeaky Toy. Oh, darling, it's just divine! It's remarkable. It's stunning. It's grand! But it's all wrong. But it's my best work yet, cupcake. But it simply has to be better than your best, darling. I mean, look at these spots. The shapes aren't at all acceptable. They're not soft enough. (GIGGLES) You know, cuddly, like something you'd want to squeeze the life out of! No, this one is no good at all, an embarrassing mediocrity, a complete failure. Your harsh words strike me like blows from the fists of a large dockworker. I would cry now were it not so bourgeois. There, there. I know you'll get it right, my depressive da Vinci. You simply have to keep trying. After all, you're the only one who truly understands Cruella, who can see into her tortured soul. Yes! Her heart is like a vast, dark ocean on whose waves I am hopelessly adrift in my dinghy of passion. (CHUCKLES) I shall not betray your faith in me! I shall create another canvas! And another! And another! And another! Until I have found spotted perfection! I shall not stop until the fires of your craving have been quenched. Junior deputy test? Which episode was that in? One of the lost episodes. But I only give it to pups who I think might be worthy. And, who knows, if you do real good, maybe I'll even let you be on the show with me! Really? Sure, kid. I'm the star, aren't I? (LAUGHS) Mother of pasteurized milk! That stagecoach is out of control! This is your first junior deputy test, kid. Okay, well... This is just like in episode 37, "Stagecoaches of Serpent Summit." Very good. Now, episode 37, was that the one where I leap, run and pounce? No, no. That was the one where you run, pounce and leap! Precisely! Stand back! (EXCLAIMING) Get a hold of yourself, man. You're out of control! (NEIGHS) Whoa! It's okay! I'll get the brake! (BOTH SCREAMING) (BARKING) Still no photographers. How odd.

Of course, I do! I do this all the time! (COUGHS) So let's talk about you, kid! Me? Yeah, what's your story? Well... Hold on. Okay. Go on. Missing! What do you mean, he's missing? We've looked. And looked. But there's just no sign of Thunderbolt anywhere! This is a catastrophe! A calamity! A cataclysm! We have to shoot first thing in the morning and I find out my star is missing. How can you shoot a show without a star? How can you shoot a show without a star? How do you spell "cataclysm"? How can you shoot a show without a star? How can you shoot a show without a... A star? This is it! This is megafantabulous! We'll rewrite this episode to star Lil' Lightning! Oh, I'm a genius! Get the writers! Fire the director! This is going to be a whole new direction for The Thunderbolt... (SNICKERS) "A whole new direction!" What do you think of that, Thunderbolt, old pal? Finally, I'll be able to step out of your shadow, you overrated, overacting ham! The Lil' Lightning Adventure Hour. It has a nice ring, doesn't it? What do you think? (LAUGHING) I have failed you, my muse! Oh, fickle bird of inspiration, to what far shore have you flown? Poor pathetic Lars, do not despair. I know exactly where to find the inspiration we crave. Well, this is art, after all. Art! Our creativity cannot be thwarted by trivial matters like restraining orders. Yes, sacrifices must be made! Gone? They're all gone? How unspeakably rude of Anita to move away without even leaving a forwarding address! Lars, now what am I to do? Why, you little... What's this? I know you. Oh, this is delicious. "Cherry Tree Farm, Little Tichfield, Devon." (BARKS) (LAUGHS) Oh, no. Freckles, dear. Stop helping. (TEA KETTLE WHISTLING) Oh, my, the tea! (BARKING) Yes, the paper! No time to read this if I'm going to finish my new song. Well, I come from this really big family. I knew a guy came from a big litter, 10 or 12, I forget. There's 101 of us. 101 Dalmatians? Hey, I heard about you guys. Yeah, you were on the Twilight Bark. Well, that's just it, isn't it? I'm afraid all I'll ever be is one of 101. (SIGHS) At least that's what my dad thinks. Hey, Thunderbolt? How do you become a One-of-a-Kind Wonder Dog, anyway? Well, in my case, it all hinged on getting just the right agent. But, you know, kid, getting there isn't so tough, it's staying on top. That's the real challenge. You think you're doing great and all of a sudden, there's somebody trying to take your place. Crowd you out! Push you aside! Steal your spot! Precisely! Precisely! You know, you're all right, kid. (GIGGLES) I'll tell you what, little buddy. I'm planning on doing some more big hero stuff today. You stick with me, maybe you'll get your picture in the paper, show the world that you're not just another dog. (BARKS) Oh, no, no, no. Like this. (CLEARS THROAT) (INHALES) (BARKS LOUDLY) (ALL SQUAWKING) Uh-oh. (SQUAWKING) (LAUGHS) What? Patch in London? Don't you worry. I'll keep an eye on things here. This is all my fault. If only I hadn't lost count. Stop blaming yourself, dear. The important thing now is that we find him before Cruella De Vil does! It's not fair, Horace, me lad. It's just not fair. How come she gets off with probation and a restraining order... While we's left rotting away in here? Off your bums, lads. Sprung for your bail, somebody has. It must be Mum come to spring us! Mum never liked me. Must be good old Dad! Dad never liked you, either. Jasper, Horace. It's time to finish the job. Oh, no, not her. We always get the worst end of it with her. Well, if she wants us to work for her this time, we won't be made fools of. You look just like Mum. Shut up, you! I ain't going through with this, I tell you. I ain't! Here he comes now! (GRUNTS) Go on, Jasper. Go on. Go! Go on, go! Afternoon, love! Something I can... (SCREAMING) Hello, there. Something I can do for a pretty young lady like yourself? Of course you can, you naughty man. (CHUCKLES) You can just give me this truck! (SCREAMS) (WHOOPING) They're all inside, Jasper! Go ahead and start it up!

Jasper? What? Can we just go back to jail, now? Your muse has returned! (GIGGLES) But I am a failure. You should despise me. Stop being such a wet blanket and come see what I've brought for you! A gift? For me? How very Christmas morning with the twinkle lights of you. The gift of inspiration! Well, of course, these are only just about the most adorable little puppies I've ever seen in my whole life! Look at these cute little darlings! Fuzzy wuzzy little puppy poo. Poo poo, little puppy poo. Did you see that? Did you see that? He gave me a little kissy! I'm going to kiss him back now. He's having a wobbly. And you mean for me to do a painting of them, don't you? That's an absolutely lovely idea! It makes me smile a lot. (CACKLES) "Painting of them," he says. (ALL LAUGHING) No, no, no, darling. I don't want you to make art of the puppies. I want you to make art with the puppies. Use their coats as canvases. Create a masterpiece in a new medium. Together, you and I will stun the art world with our ruthless originality! But that means... (GASPS) How could you do such a thing to the cute little puppies? Poison them. Drown them. Bash them in the head! I may be eccentric, but I am not a sicko! What? And you'll not hurt one spot on these innocent little creatures' heads, not as long as I have anything to say about it! (MUFFLED PROTESTS) I thought you were a man of vision, someone who understood my passions, who understood the complexity that is Cruella! Does no one get the point? Lars, you're such a disappointment. Well, if I can't have a masterpiece, at least I'll finally have a fabulous Dalmatian coat. That's almost as good, don't you agree?

We've been out here doing hero stuff all day and none of these London photographers seem to care. Why do you want photographers around? Kid. Look, I got something to tell you. (DOG BARKING) Something I guess I should've told you a long time ago. I don't know how to say this, but the truth is... Thunderbolt, listen! There's an emergency! Sounds like a kidnapping! Being held in a warehouse, a devil woman, 101 Dalmatians. Hey, what a coincidence! You come from a family of 101, too! Wait, what's the matter, kid? That is my family. Cruella must have them again! Cruella? The devil woman! She's the one who kidnapped us before. This is awful. What am I going to do? Wait a second. Thunderbolt! You'll help us, won't you? Yes. Well, kid, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. You see, I'm not really a... Of course, I'll help you, Patch. Yeah, the world-famous Thunderbolt rescues the world-famous 101 Dalmatians. (BARKING) Sounds like a good story to me! Newsworthy, even. Come on. We'll let them know I'm on my way. The villains will soon cringe in fear! Mighty Thunderbolt is here!

POODLE GIRL: Well, Thunderbolt is going to save those little Dalmatian puppies! (GASPS) The ones that were kidnapped? That's right! SWOONING DOG GIRL 2: Isn't he just a dream? More like a nightmare! What if Blunderbolt gets lucky and succeeds? If the press got wind of that, I'd never be rid of him! Look, that must be the warehouse. Let's try over there. Hey, do you think you can reach that? No problem. Thunderbolt, old pal. Lightning? Lightning! What are you doing here? I came as soon as I heard. Thought you might need a bit of help. Thanks for coming, little buddy. Wouldn't miss it. JASPER: What's that supposed to be? Leave us alone, Jasper. I think it's kind of pretty. So, what's the plan, kid? See those guards? I think you can sneak past them. Remember the end of episode 39, "Flight from the Forbidden Fort"? The one where I ran, jumped and sprang? No, no. Sneaked, evaded and triumphed. Oh, yeah, of course. I get it. Hey, you're a pretty smart kid. That's a good plan, stealthy. But we don't need any of that! This is Thunderbolt! Villains always cringe in fear whenever Thunderbolt is here! So true. What we need is a full frontal assault! How hard can it be? That's right! How hard can it be? Follow me! I'm right behind you, pal. Sort of looks like you, except you don't have that much hair. (BARKING) It's Patch. And he's brought Thunderbolt! He'll save us! Here now, where'd you come from? Get out of here, you stupid mutt! Maybe they didn't hear you. Don't worry, kid. This'll be take two. (BARKING) (BOTH EXCLAIMING) That's more like it. What have we here? It's you. (GIGGLES) I owe you a debt of gratitude, my photogenic little friend! If it wasn't for you, I'd have never found your brothers and sisters. And now I have you all! (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Thunder, are you playing dead? (GROANS) That hurt. That really hurt. I knew you were faking it. (CHUCKLES) He's been faking it, all right! Lightning, little buddy! I am not your little buddy, and you are no Wonder Dog. This kid trusted you, and look where it's got him! What does he mean? He's been lying to you all day, kid. He doesn't care about you or your family. He was just trying to get his name in the paper and save his job. Ask him! No! Well, yeah. But... But... But, but, but. Hey, genius, you're no hero. You're a fraud. And by the way, there never was a plan to recast you. I just had to get you out of the way. (LAUGHS) Now I gotta go take your place on the show. My show. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Thunder? Thunder? I don't understand. You lied to me? I put on an act. I'm an actor. It's what I do. But you said I could be your junior deputy... I made all that up! I just needed someone who knew the script. But you said that you'd help us. Don't you get it, kid? All that running around and saving the day stuff, it's... It's make-believe! It's not real. You promised! (CRYING) Patch, I just... (SIGHS) You lied. I'm sorry, all right? (CRYING) I'm not a real Wonder Dog. I just acted like one once. (PUPPY WHIMPERS) I'm hungry. I want to go home. It's scary here. Where's Mother? (WHIMPERING) Patch? Are you okay? Patch? Dad was right. I am just one of 101. (SIGHS) I'm sorry, Lucky. This is all my fault. Hey, didn't Thunderbolt get out of a cage like this once? You know, in episode 13, "The Flaming Flea Circus." Episode 18. Episode 18! (PUPPIES BARKING) Did you see what Patch just did? Wizard, Patch! Absolutely wizard! Hey, shut your yapping! I'm trying to get me beauty sleep. (SNORING) Okay, you guys, stick together and be quiet. Don't look so put out. My favorite furrier will be open in the morning and then we'll be out of your hair. Perfect! Episode 53, "The Mineshaft Mix-up." Everybody, stay here until I tell you it's safe to come out. What is it with... (SCREAMS) You let the puppies get away! You let the puppies get away! JASPER: Hold on! HORACE: They can't have gone far. Here, start searching! When that crazy bird finds out we lost them again, she'll skin us! Horace! Jasper! What are you looking for? Nothing, mum! We haven't lost the doggies or anything! You let them escape? Jasper fell asleep! You were snoring like a train! (PATCH BARKING) The lift is barking. The mutts must already be downstairs. Funny how we never heard the lift. Shut up, you! Come on, they'll be back soon! Aren't we going down? Nope. We're going up! Ready, Rolly? No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! Whoa! Can I do that again? Okay, now the rest of you. I'm just saying, maybe the puppies are still upstairs and they just tricked us into coming down here. Come on now, Horace. Dogs ain't that smart. They haven't got the big, educated brains we got. 97, away! 98, away! 99, away! (SCREAMS) (LAUGHS) Get him! (PANTING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) (GRUMBLING) (MUFFLED GRUNTS) VENDOR: Thanks, guv. BUS DRIVER: Cheers. Come on. We're gonna hitch a ride! (SNARLS) (GASPS) (GASPS) Here they come! There they are! Get them! (PANTING) What happened? She pushed me! Did not! (PUPPIES SCREAMING) (PATCH GRUNTING) The crazy lady is right behind us! (GROANING) (GIGGLING) He had a birdie in his mouth! You idiots! Here, take the wheel! (ALL GASP) Speed up, you imbeciles, or we'll lose them! Ha-ha! That's one! Just 98 more to go! Okay, okay, quiet on the set. We're rolling! And action, Wholesome Tommy! Lightning, you're one of a... (GULPS) (HORN HONKING) (SCREAMING) Patch, help me! Well, well, if it isn't the little half-pint hero again! (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Wow! Check out Patch! (SCREAMING) (SIGHS) (GASPS) What do we do now, Patch? See those windows? We can reach them from the upper deck! You go ahead, I'll hold them off. Somehow. (BARKING) Oh, here's a feisty one. (BARKING) (THUNDERBOLT BARKS LOUDLY) PATCH: Thunderbolt! How you doing, kid? But I thought... Come on, haven't you seen the show? I always arrive just in the nick of time. Look, I may not be a real hero, but I can act like one! (BARKS) (GASPS) Lightning, don't let them hurt me! Heart. My heart. Lightning, this might be the end! (HOWLING IN PAIN) (SHUSHING) PUPPY: She might see us. Give me that! I'll put this mongrel out of his misery! (GROANS) (HOWLS) Lightning, I can feel the warm kiss of life ere it parts my cheek. Do not mourn me when I am gone! It is enough that you were here at the end. (DRAMATIC SIGH) Goodbye, old friend. (SOBBING) Good night, sweet prince! (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (ALL SCREAM) (COUGHS) (BARKING) (BARKING) ON RADIO: Dispatch to Car 47, what's your situation? Over. No, no, fellas. I'm not with them! I was trying to help Thunderbolt, honest! That's what I do. I'm a sidekick. We're a team! Come on, fellas! Come on! Don't you watch TV? Now, who's the pathetic ham actor? I am painting spots, but she doesn't like them so good and then she says, "No, you must kill them," and I'm not so sturdy. She's very mean to me! And then I pass out. There they are. Those are the ones! She made us do it! She made us do it! Spots? I do see spots, you know. (LAUGHING) They're everywhere! CRUELLA: Spot! Spot! Spot! Spot! ROGER: There they are! It's wonderful! They're all here! Come now. Stop it. Stop it. We were so worried about you. Penny, Lucky, my darling puppies! (BARKING) Patch! You're safe. We were so worried about you. We missed you very much, Patch. You did? Of course, Son. Mom, Dad, this is Thunderbolt. He saved us. I don't know how to thank you for saving my family. No, no. Don't thank me. It was your son, Patch, who... Mom! Dad! The devil woman got us. And we were trapped and then Patch got us out! Yeah. And Patch made me a trampoline! You should have seen Patch, Mother. He was fantastic. Just like Thunderbolt! (THUNDERBOLT LAUGHING) You know, they're right, kid. Me, I'm just an actor. But you, you are a real One-of-a-Kind Wonder Dog! Hey, lads, they're over here!
