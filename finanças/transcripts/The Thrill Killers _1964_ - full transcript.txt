(cool jazz) - [Voicover] Hollywood, California. The man you're looking at is Joe Saxon. He's one of many caught in the web of non-reality. Non-reality. This is the reason he is here in Hollywood. The land of the stars. Joe's ambition is to be one, a star. A star of motion pictures, that world of make believe. So far Joe has had very little success. For that road to stardom can be a long and hard grind. Unfortunately, Joe has refused to accept the world of reality, and has found himself trapped amongst the monthly payment plans. He's got a new house, a new car, new TV set, swimming pool. Very impressive to the people here in Hollywood. But unless the monthly payments are kept up, there won't be any TV sets, or swimming pools. Time to call his wife, and give her the news of today. (slow jazz) This is Joe's wife, Liz. Former actress turned artist. (phone rings) She gave up the business a long time ago. The insecurity was too much for her. But then she met Joe, and love won out. But love can also wear out. When the bills keep coming, and the stomach starts to get hungry. But Joe has another hunger. That to be a movie star. Even if he has to play make-believe all day, just for himself. Joe Saxon. Caught in the world of non-reality. (toy piano) These are the children of Dennis Kasteckian. Young Greek immigrant. Dennis is caught in the world of reality. He must make those monthly payments. As you can see, he has a lot of mouths to feed. His English isn't the greatest, but his desire to succeed is. And where is there a better place to succeed in, than in America? Dennis Kasteckian, a realist. (engine throbs) - Hi, can I give you a lift? (ominous music) No! Don't! No, don't! Don't! (gun fires) (horn blows) (gun fires) (gun fires) (upbeat go-go music) - Hey, Joe? I saw part of your movie this afternoon. Boy, was it bad! - Hi, honey. - What was it I said? Boy, I couldn't sit through the rest of it. - Was it that bad? - It was that bad. - Joe, what are you trying to prove with this party? You're just spending money that we don't have, and there's no one here but a lot of crazy people. - Just let me worry about that. Well, here you are, Mr. Hall, rum and coke. - Thank you, Joe. - I'll have a little bourbon and soda, Joe. - Alright. - Thank you, very much. (partiers laughing and talking) (screams) - I saw your picture this afternoon, Joe, and I must say I thought extremely slow. - Of course, but that was just a rough cut. Rough cuts are usually slow, aren't they? - Oh, I wasn't criticizing your acting, Joe. It had nothing to do with your acting. - I'm not trying to defend my acting. I know I'm not the best in the business. - Well, I will have to go along with Archie, it was a little bit slow. - That's right, Mr. Morgan. - Of course, your judgment is much better than mine. - Well, after all, Arch and I have seen enough rough cuts, we should be a good judge, don't you think? - That's right, Mr. Morgan. - Of course, you've probably seen more rough cuts than I've seen pictures. (laughing) - Ah, you've got nothing to worry about, Joe. Well, you know, you put in a little music, and you put in some sound effects, and a dissolve and a couple of opticals, you'll have a pretty fair little picture. - What is your next picture, Mr. Morgan? - Well, after all, it's a little early to talk about that. - That's right. - Well, it's just in the planning stage, but uh, if there's an egg for you, I'll remember you, boy. - [Toady] That's right, Mr. Morgan. - I thought the race track scene of mine was pretty good, wasn't it? - Say, you know, I like a good scene, and it was good. - Maybe that's because Joe had so much practice at Santa Anita. (laughs) - Yeah, or Hollywood Park, huh? - [Toady] That's right, Mr. Morgan. (motorcycle rumbles through) (loud splash) - [Morgan] In the pool! - That's right, Mr. Morgan. (go-go music) (partiers laughing, shouting and talking) (singing softly) - Well, here we are. - It's a great place you have here. - Yeah, for the rats. (traffic noise) - You got something to drink here? - Yeah, scotch. You want some? - Yeah. - First we'll have some music, alright? Proper procedure. Glasses. And then the booze. Then, the... (soulful jazz) Scotch. Tell me something, will you? - What would you like to know? - What do you do for a living? - Oh, I just sort of kill time. - Then why are you dressed in blue jeans and boots to go dancing for ten cents a dance? And then offer me fifty dollars to bring me to my apartment to talk? - What makes you think I want to talk? - I don't. You know something, you're a weirdo. - You don't say. - But I think I could get to like you. - Why don't you try? - Hmm, why don't you help? - You mean, like this? - Mm hmm. (hard slap) Hey! What did you do that for? - People are no good! - What do you mean, people are no good? - I hate people. They're no good! - Oh boy, you are a weirdo. - You're cheap! - Cheap? What's so cheap about fifty dollars? (slow piano jazz) - I hate you. I'm going to kill you. (screams) (hard slap) (hard slap) - Help! - No! - Help! (hard slap) (hard slap) (screams) - Whoa! (screams) (screams) (screams) (screams) (intense orchestral music) - [Radio Announcer] We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin. At 10:29 this evening, three inmates of the state asylum for the criminally insane successfully made their escape after slaying five guards and hurdling the 20 foot barbed wire wall that surrounds the institution. Authorities have identified the escapees as Herbie Click, Keith Rogers, and Gary Barcroft. Complete descriptions of these men will be broadcast at a later hour. Residents of the Topanga Canyon are hereby warned to be on the lookout for the three escaped mental patients. Any information leading to their whereabouts should immediately be forwarded to Chief Patton at District Headquarters, or to this radio station. Do not, we repeat, do not, on any account, attempt to apprehend these men on your own. They are armed and extremely dangerous. And now, back to our regularly scheduled program. - Well, I guess we didn't have all the lunatics at our party tonight. - I wish you'd just forget about that. - I'd like to forget about it. I'd like to forget about Hollywood. For good. - Come on, what's the matter with you tonight? - It's just that I don't like to see you living in a dream world all the time. - Now what do you mean by that? - I don't think you know the difference between reality and the roles you play. Here we are up to our necks in debt, and you throw a party. We can't even pay the rent, much less the liquor bill. - You let me worry about that. (romantic orchestral music) - Oh, Joe. Can't we go away for awhile? - You know I can't leave the telephone. It might ring any minute with the part I've been waiting for. - Oh, Joe. (slow orchestral music) (quiet orchestral music) (driving jazz) - Hi. - Monica, Tony! Come here! I thought I told you never to talk to strangers! (car whooshes past) (sparse orchestral music) - [Radio Announcer] And now for the local news. Early this morning, police discovered the body of dance hostess Arena Davour, in her apartment at 465 South Main Street in Los Angeles. Investigating officers located the murder weapon, a pair of household scissors, near her mutilated corpse. Fingerprints found at the scene of the crime have led police officials to believe Miss Davour's assailant is Mort "Mad Dog" Click, long wanted by the authorities of other states for similar horrendous crimes. A statewide manhunt has been organized for the deranged psychopathic killer. Also on the local scene, Chief of Police Drummond, disclosed today, his department has no further clues to the identity of the murderer of traveling salesman Dennis Kasteckian, whose body was found yesterday out on Highway 101. According to the victim's wife, Mr. Kasteckian was en route to Lancaster to conclude a business transaction. Kasteckian's car, a blue 1953 Plymouth station wagon, is believed to have been stolen by his killer. And now for other news. There has been no further word on the three mental patients who escaped yesterday from the state asylum at... (radio clicks off) - What do we owe you, Linda? - It's on the house. (dance hall music) Since you two are getting married next month, just consider it a little wedding present from me. - Well thank you. - Oh, and by the way, where are you two living after you get married? - Ron found a place real cheap, right near here. - Old Hank Lawry's place. - I haven't seen it yet, but Ron says it's just great. - Well, I hope you two know what you're doing. The last time I was over at old Hank's place there was nothing but a bunch of weeds. - Ron can change that. - Yeah. Good bye, Linda. And thanks again for the drinks. - How about a cup of coffee, for a weary traveler? - Well, if it isn't cousin Elizabeth from glitter city. What are you all doing way out here in the sticks, honey? - It's a long story. - Well, tell cousin Linda all about it. She has nice, long ears. - I just can't take it anymore. Phony actors, phony life, I'm just bored. - Speaking of actors, how is your handsome husband? - I wouldn't know. I left before he got up this morning. - Without saying good bye? - I left him a note. - Well, there it is, honey. It needs a little work, but uh, for only a hundred bucks down, what more could we ask? - Just great. Just like I pictured it. - Come on, we'll fix it up. Come on, I'll show you around. (knocks on door) (knocks on door) Hank? Maybe he's around back. (record player at end of record) (ominous music) Hank? Hank, where are you? - Oh, he's not here. - He's here somewhere, 'cause he knew we were coming out to see the place today. Come on. He's close. Record player's still going. Wait here a second. Hank? Hank, where are you? Hank, where are you? He's not in there. Let's go out back, there's something I want to show you anyway. - Oh, I forgot my radio. - We'll get it later. - What are your plans for this? - I thought we'd fix it up and rent it out, maybe. It's got an upstairs. Room for a couple of bedrooms. Come on, I'll show you. (door slams) (screams) - Hank! - You looking for Hank? Here he is. (intense music) (screams) (screaming) - On the ground!

If you like her for a game partner. Keith, would you like that girl for a party? - Yeah, you, would you like that broad? - Yeah. Yeah. - Well then, hurry up. - Bring her out here. Bring her out here, she's your broad. (screams) (yelling and screaming) (heavy dramatic music) (laughing) - Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her! (screaming, yelling, maniacal laughing) - open it! - I didn't do it, Gary. - Open it! Open the door! - He did it, he did it, get him, Gary, get him, get him! Hit him, hit him, Gary! Give it to him. - I told you, don't lock me in! (screams) I told you, you lousy rotten screw, don't lock me in! (screams) (sobs) - Gary, hey! Hold it, Gary. Hold it, boy. Take it easy, take it easy. Calm down, Gary. Calm, calm down, Gary. Calm down. Calm, man. Hose, Gary. Cool it, baby. Who is...

(screams) Today, big Uncle Big John is going to tell you the story of Little Red Riding Hood. - [Gary] No, don't run any more. Now you stop. Don't run. Stop. Stop. (screams) - [Uncle Big John] Right out to the wolf. Wolf, you fiend, your time has come. Then the hunter turned back to the wolf, and chopped off the wolf's head. (screaming) (axe falls) And her Grandmother, and the hunter, lived happily ever after. (go-go music) - Good morning, baby. Hey, you forgot my breakfast this morning. - Not exactly. - You remember Mr. Morgan. - Oh, hello, Liz. - Mr. Morgan, this is Liz's cousin, Linda. - Hi. - I'm very happy to know you, Linda. - George is a producer, and he's looking for a location for his next film. Since Liz was up here, I thought I'd bring him up and show him your diner. - Ah, this is the greatest. Just what I've been looking for, Joe. Beautiful. Yes sir, this place really has a lot of character. - Hey, you left mighty early this morning. - If you came to take me back with you, you might as well just turn around and go back to Hollywood. - Aw, let's not have a fight before breakfast. - You know, we dirty up these walls a little, this'll make a great set for the murder sequence. (horn honks) - Keith, come on! Keith, come on, what are you doing? - So cool it, Dad, I had to get a shirt, didn't I? I had to get a shirt. - Come on! - Go. - If we can dirty up the walls a little, we can use the place. And I'll pay you a hundred bucks a day. - I don't know, I just painted the place. - We can re-do it when we finish. - Well, can I feed my customers while you're shooting? - Well, I'm sorry, but uh, I'll tell you what you can do. You can feed my cast and crew. You'll make just as much. Maybe even more. - What are you stopping here for? - Because I gotta get some hot coffee down me. And I gotta call my brother in L.A. so he can help us. - Let me out, I want a beer. - Yeah, yeah, a beer. - Hello. - Hello. - Could you possibly direct me to the nearest telephone? - Yeah, it's right over there, around the corner. - Thank you very much, lady. - Pardon me, Mr. Morgan. - Surely. - Oh, these darn flies.
