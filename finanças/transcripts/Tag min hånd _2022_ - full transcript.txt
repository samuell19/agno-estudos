This is our house. It has a heated floor in the bathroom. We bought it when I was expecting Magnus. I know every corner of it. - Please. - Thank you. Keep the change. And this is my husband. The one struggling with his balance. - So, can you find the door? - Sure. If I can see it. Damn ... I forgot my key. Well, you said you brought yours so I didn't bring mine. We met when we were young, and we've been together for almost 25 years. Claes wanted children, but waited patiently till I'd gotten my degree. Claes works with IT solutions, and we've just been to a company dinner. Why's that lying there? - Loose boards. - Didn't you get hold of the carpenter? Sure, a week ago. I think he has a selective memory. We've been working on an extension for a year. An annex for our son. - Magnus? - Hey, hey. Claes ... let him sleep. He's a teenager and we'd like him to stick around for a few more years. - His window's open. - I'll go wait by the door. - Claes always finds creative solutions. - Dad? I just forgot my keys. Go back to sleep. - Dad! - Yeah. Sorry. Sleep well. - And he usually finds a good solution. - It wasn't locked. Sunday. I love that word. Peace. Quiet. Birds singing. Freedom to be together and do something fun. Family. Time to be there for each other. Is that an arrow? Claes is a good dad. He's great with Magnus. They're always finding stuff online and have the same ability - - to immerse themselves in the oddest characters on the Internet. Whenever I look at them I can't believe my luck. - You told the licorice story. Again. - It's funny. Luckily, I can still laugh at my husband's jokes. Either they're really funny, or his enthusiasm for them is worth it. Someone has to perk up a company - - that's as entertaining as ... dill. I'm a medical doctor, and I'm working on my dissertation. It requires self-discipline if you're to tend to your family, too. I'm the one who wakes up the house, and it has long since ceased to bother me. It's time. Come on. Morning, Magnus sweetie. Upsy-daisy. I was warned about the changes of that age - - but who knew they could sleep so much? I should show him off at work as a special medical case. Here we go ... Magnus, you still aren't dressed. I have a conference, come on. - Okay, Mom. I'm practically ready. - So... Don't you have a meeting? There's a huge stain on your shirt. - A stain. On your shirt. - Where? I wouldn't say I'm a perfectionist. - That little thing? - Yes. We don't see Magnus much anymore. He has new interests in life. - Can the girls resist you? - Mom ... Every day I fear he'll want to go to school on his own. I love taking him. - It's a chance to talk about nothing. - Are you going to the club today? - Yeah, I'll go after confirmation prep. - Come again? - What? - You're getting confirmed? Yeah, I had to sign up fast or I wouldn't get the cool pastor. I hope this phase passes when he realizes the work involved. - Big hug for mama. - Yeah. See you, Mom. Have a good day. I always look forward to work. I like that there are expectations. I'm an invasive cardiologist. I tend diseases of the heart. It's my job to make sure it keeps beating. The catheter has passed through arteria radialis to aorta ascendance. Signe is my lunch buddy and close friend. You're staring at my lunch again. We'd better swap. Unbelievable. She's a brilliant doctor. And her life is unreal. Are you still seeing Wednesday Kim? I don't get that arrangement. What don't you get? It's perfect for me. He comes by after work every Wednesday. We have a nice meal. Hang out. Have sex. The next morning I go off to my work, and he goes off to his. - What if he meets someone new? - Nah, that won't happen. A chubby 50-year-old man who spends his time in the forest counting birds? Hardly. I couldn't live like that. I love everyday life. - Did you say something? - What? - Did you say something? - No. Yes, that's also a part of life. It doesn't bother me. We have chosen each other. Does it get boring from time to time? Yes, of course it does. There are loads of ways to live. Loads of options. - Excuse me. - Hi, Maja. - Hi. I have morning briefing. - Bye ... They must think I'm the most straitlaced suburban wife in the world. But I love the life we've built together. It's important to find time for little surprises and to keep the spark alive. "Hi, honey. Will be home tomorrow. Sorry." But Claes travels a lot for work. I miss him when he's away - - although I've gotten used to it through the years. Sort of. - Hi, sweetie. - Mom, what the hell? Shh ... I'll just lie right here. Don't do that! I always look forward to Claes coming home. - Hi, honey. - Hi. Welcome home. - Shall we grab some lunch? - Uhm, no, I gotta stop by the office. But it was a good trip? Yeah. Sure ... - Pull over. - But the office? Yes, but ... Just for a minute. Okay, Claes. Please tell me what the hell is going on. I want a divorce. You want a divorce? Easy now. We've been married 20 years. We have a child together. Magnus. We have everything together. You don't just say: "I want a divorce." Honey, I'm ... I'm so sorry, but it's because ... ... right now ... we've reached a point when I don't love you anymore. There, there, there. Shh, shh. Honey ... You're having a crisis. Okay? Do you understand? - No, not really. - It's normal, and we can fix it. We'll talk over a nice bottle of wine or to a marriage counselor or not. - Yeah, I'm not doing that. - What would you like to do, honey? Yes? Yes, goddammit! Ding-dong what? - I don't know what to tell Magnus. - No. Where are you now? - Out walking. - Okay. I drove around till the battery went flat. - Shall I come over? - No, no. I have to get hold of Magnus. Hi, sweetie. - Are you sure this it what you want? - Yes. - Can we talk? - Magnus, do you have a minute? Sit down, please. Claes ... So... Your mom and I have, after many long and deep conversations - - agreed to get a divorce. It's important you know that we're still friends and that we love you - - just as much as always. Right? You'll stay in the house, and we'll make plans - - for you to stay with me every other weekend - - once I've gotten my housing situation in order. Right? Yes. So, that's the lay of the land. But ... why are you getting divorced? Uhm ... what can I say? Sometimes grown-ups simply grow apart. Like, lately Mom has spent a lot of time on her work and dissertation - - and that has taken her in a direction where it's taken up a lot of space. We must all be constructive. I, for one, would like to be just that. So, uhm ... yes. I'll call you, okay? Yes, it's so constructive of you - - to ditch your family for some cheap ... - Hi, Elin. Morten. - Hi. I'm sorry, honey. - It's okay, Mom. - Sweetie ... Know what? Dad's just having a little crisis. Everything's gonna be fine. 3 weeks later We gotta go, Magnus. Come on. - He's an asshole. - He mustn't have been happy. Forget him. If you change your Facebook status ... - Hi, Maja. - Hi. - Can you change it back? - I think so. Why? I'm already getting friend requests from random men. Including Sebastian. That guy? He's hot. Is he the one from Endocrinology? - Yeah. - I'd jump him in a heartbeat. You have no idea how few men I've slept with in my entire life. One. Claes. Well, and Christopher from continuation school. So not just one then. You've slept with two. - Okay, Signe. It doesn't matter. - Sorry. No, it does matter. Don't you think that ... some day ... ... a little ray of sunshine like that comes along and ... ... you find renewed energy and then ... Yeah ... But I miss Claes. It's vitamin-D at the very least. - Did you pack a warm sweater? - Yes. I could pack you a lunch. What'll you do while I'm at Dad's? - Have a moment to myself. - So, you'll be working. No, honey. I'll be relaxing. - Where are you staying? - Dad said he'll take me to the house. - Oh? "The house?" - Yes. Susanna's. - Where is it? - Skovbrynet, I think. I'll miss you. See you. Call me if there's anything. Bye. Hi, sweetie. Shall I get your bag? Oh, yes. Yeah, take me, Claes. - Take mel! - Ah, it's wonderful. So right. - Is it better than with your ex? - Much better. - How much better? - A thousand times better. I already filled out my part. It's 650 kroner. - Okay, yes. - And maybe go offline on Facebook. Magnus keeps getting the notification: "Friend nearby." - Okay. Thank you. - Have a nice evening now. Signe, it was so embarrassing. Please don't turn into Jeanette. Still crying over Jens five years on. Her wheels have come off. So, you did a pericardiocentesis? And you have him on a double hemo-plate protocol? Perfect. That's an A+++. - You're doing an echo, right? - Right. By the way, I'm going out with some ladies on Friday. Wanna come? Maja? What's going on? I was the one who found him boring. If anyone was leaving, it should be me. I'm way better looking than him, too. - Right? - Sure. It's at 9 P.M., if you wanna come. - Abundance of riches. - Yes. - Are you done for the day? - Not quite. I have one last meeting. You won't accept my Facebook request, so how about a coffee date? - No, thank you. No dates for me. - It's just coffee. - Which isn't a date? - I wouldn't pick my workplace for that. ... so I decided to do my dissertation on reperfusion injuries. It's due this summer. Yes. How about you? You're in endocrinology. - Yes. - On a locum-tenancy? Yes. I came home about two weeks ago from Sudan. - Sudan? Wow. - UNICEF. A former colleague works for them, so I thought what the hell ... Right. - This does actually feel like a date. - Oh? Well it's not. Excuse me. I'll just get this. - Maja speaking. - Hi, it's Emily. - Hi. - How are you holding up? - What do you mean? - I couldn't bear if you didn't know. That's sweet of you, but I found out on my own. Oh, well that's good. Blondish girl, long legs. - Yeah, long, skinny, stilt-like legs. - I guess you could say that. - That's her. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Okay. So that's ... - It was nice of you to call, Emily. - Of course. - Sorry about that. - No problem. Sudan. So are you planning on returning? No, not for a couple of years. I need to settle down in Denmark - - and I have an 11-year-old daughter from a previous relationship ... Excuse me. Listen, did you say she was really blond? More like dark blond. Short haircut and very young. 25 tops. - And when was that again? - Uhm, a year or so ago at the school. I can't believe it. Emily, talk to you later. Hey, you've reached Claes Damtoft. Leave a message. Hi, Claes. It's Maja. What the hell? So it's not just that Susanna-woman! You've been screwing Magnus's PE teacher! Have you lost your mind?! Who do you think I am?! Yuck, Claes! You're a dirty old pig! Yuck! Argh! Argh! Application for Separation or Divorce Instant divorce - That'll be 350. - Yes. - Put it on my tab. - No, you shouldn't do that. You don't remember me? - Appendicitis. - What? Five years ago. A complicated case at AUH. - It's healed nicely. - Yes, very nicely. - Well, you did it. - I'll be off. - Signe? Signe, no. Signe ... - Coming through! It's nice to see you. Again. You, too. The circumstances are a bit more festive. Here. Yeah. - Thanks for the drink. - Don't mention it. My ass hurts like hell. If I sit for more than an hour it hurts like hell. - Let me see. - Hey, have a look at this. Oh, my God! Did he trim his man bush with a hedge cutter? That's quite a heavy scrotum. It looks like the last Frankfurter at the hot-dog stand at 4 a.m. - Yes. - Isn't it great? - Yes. But why? - Why what? - Have you never gotten a pic dick? - It's 'Dick pic". - I'm only on Facebook. - You've heard of Tinder? Yes. But the last time I was single, the fax machine had just been invented. You gotta try Tinder. It's a blast. You grab your phone, go to Tinder, and after an hour - - there are two broad-shouldered men in full uniform ready to ... - ... handcuff you or something. - A hypothetical, of course. You're so dirty, Amalie. But I don't get squirting orgasms with some polyamorous yoga teacher. - Unfortunately. - You'd like that. Seriously, Maja. The tantra class is so inspiring. How about it? No, no, no. I got divorced 10 minutes ago. Okay. Then you can't do a thing. Were you the one to walk out? In a way. In six months - - though you think it's pure hell, you land on soft grass. - On what? - Soft grass! Let's go dancing, let's ... Come on, girls. Cheers! - Cheers! Come on, join us. - Yes. Coming. Yes. - Drink some more or something ... - Yes. I'll drink some more. I can't... Can we please not dance any more? You're an awesome dancer. - What's up? - I'm wasted. - But it's only 3:30. - I gotta get home to ... uhm ... - ... Jacob. - And I'm wasted. - Get me home now. - I will, sweetie. See you. It was wonderful to meet you. Take care. Bye. Hey, hey! Where's Signe? Si... Signe? - Si-Signe! - Hang on. - What's up? - Where are we going? I don't know. I'm going home with that tall fella. That guy? What about Wednesday Kim? Well ... it's Friday, so ... See you. Hi, there. No, thank you. - Are you sure? - Yes. The lady said no thank you. - That's none of your business. - Go on home, okay? Go sleep it off. What are you doing, man? Go on! - Wow. - Yes. You're bleeding a little. Oh, is there a doctor in the house? Sleep well. DORMITORY - Vodka, no ice. Here you go. - Thanks. - So ... here we are. - Yes. Luckily. - Hey ... can we slow down a bit? - Of course. - Good morning. - Good morning. I thought you might like breakfast. - I needed that. - The coffee, you mean. That, too. - The walls are thin. - Yeah. I got a text from my friend Mikkel two floors down. He believes he heard a roaring elk last night. Oh ... Oh. Well, I think I need to ... Thanks. Have you seen my bra? I'll just get rid of this. Good morning. - Morning. - Good morning. - Hi. - Morning. How much space do you have in your car? - Come again? - Uhm ... It would be great if your mom could bring the party keg to the kiosk. That's not his mom. It's the elk. Cute. Morning. - Andreas? Well, well. - He lives in a dorm. So? That means you can't see him? Give me a break. My stretchmarks are older than him. - Is it from him? - Mm. - Aren't you gonna answer? - No. Right. Then say you're heading for the shower. - That I'm heading for the shower? - Go on. - Yes, I am ... - Heading for the shower. - ... heading for the shower. - There you go, you little rascal. - What does he say? - May I join you? Yes. Anytime. - No. That's enough of that. - What are you talking about? I'm talking about dirty texts to someone masturbating in a dorm room. - Ask him if he wants to get together. - Nope. It's adolescent nonsense. Okay. I'm off to 201. I'm just interested in what my options are at this time. Of course. I see you have a loan for an annex. Is the project finalized? Almost. Due to some craftsmen, the project ... And there's an overdraft on your overdraft facility. And is it correct that your husband has vacated your joint address? Yes, that's correct. I got divorced. Please forgive me. Yeah. - I'll just make a note of that. - Okay. - But I work as a full-time doctor. - Yeah, I know that. You know that. Okay. And I'll be an attending this summer. - So then you can do more shifts. - I do all the shifts I can get. But if I can get more shifts, I will. Yes, so what I can do, quite extraordinarily - - is raise your overdraft limit. - Okay, then that's what we'll do. - I hope you're happy with our service. Yes. You get a huge smiley. I might like a shower now. Right back at ya! Found your bra. There, there and there. Take care, okay, sweetie? - Don't forget Saturday 12:30. - Where? You're taking me and René to the LAN party. Oh, I clean forgot, honey. I can't. I have a shift. - Mom ... - Take the train. I'll pay for you both. - I have to bring my monitor and ... - Dad's here. See you, pumpkin. Bye-bye. Kiss-kiss. - Cheers. - Cheers. - You're a doctor. - Yep. A cardiologist. - For quite a few years now. - So you're one of those go-getters. I guess. Did I get it right that you ... said that you are divorced? Yes. So now you're out realizing yourself. Rebelling a bit against boring everyday-life. That's probably about right. So how's that working out? In this moment I think it's going quite well. What are you doing? Andreas! Andreas, sit down. We'll capsize. - I hope so. - No! Andreas! - You're a bit quick on the 'no'. - We'll capsize! The water is nice and warm. Okay. A bit chilly. Come on. Come on! Come on! Oh, for God's sake ... Okay! There's this great exhibition at the Art Hall. - A former member of Antony and the ... - Or we could go to my place and screw. You're so beautiful. - My head's on the pizza tray. - Suck it up. Fuck, you're hot. - Let's make some food. - Mm. Damn, you really jammed this in there. House and garden and everything. Nice old records, you've got. "Design from Scandinavia." I'd better have a closer look at that. No, Andreas ... No licking of toes when I write an angry text to my ex. You are so insanely gorgeous. You're the hottest woman I've been with. - That's sweet. It's a lie, but sweet. - You are. Smile. - Don't you see it? - No. - You can't? - No. Give me the phone. I just need to ... I need a proper picture. Okay. My phone ... I'm writing a ... Two seconds. I want a proper picture of you. That's right. - Do something with your arm. - My arm? Yes. And more with the hair .. That's it. Yes. And your mouth. Turn your head. Damn, your ex must be insane. Yeah, you're right about that. Right. I think the photo session is over. My phone. - I don't want the photos on my phone! - You're not deleting them. - That's not physically possible. - I can't help it. Stop being so hot. Sorry about that. So nice of you to drive the kids. - Pretty short notice. - I forgot I had a shift. - It's okay. We have to get going now. - Right. Guys, did you have fun at the LAN party? Let's go, Magnus. Is this your stuff? And is that your iPad? - René, give me that iPad. - Check out this pic of Magnus's mom. Come on, Magnus. iCloud, Mom, ever heard of it? - All pics on your devices end there. - Sorry. If you'd picked us up, this wouldn't have happened. Sorry, sweetie. - How was confirmation preparation? - I'm still getting confirmed! You look thin. You need to eat better. Great, Mom. I love it when you micro-manage me. If I'm so thin, what are you cooking for dinner? You could buy a pizza. I have a shift that I couldn't get out of. Yeah right, Mom. No hurling! Good. - Seriously? - It was fine. Use your wrist. Precisely! For next time, work on flicking your wrist and your hip ... - Your hip ... - Where do you want my hip? What else? We have sex all the time. I don't have time for my dissertation. Divorce isn't all bad. - Hi. Hi, Magnus. - Hi, Dad. You ventured all the way up to the door today? Did you see the room at the boat club? I emailed you. For the confirmation. - Yes. Money's a bit tight, so ... - We'll split the bill. - Claes, I still don't know ... - Mom! She's against the confirmation. See you, sweetie. Have a nice time. Speaking of money, Sus and I are house-hunting for something bigger. - Sus? - Susanna. - Oh. - We need the equity from this house. - Say what? - You can buy me out. At a fair price. What about your solemn promise to let Magnus and me stay here? I didn't promise to pay my ex-wife's mortgage forever. - So are we gonna live under a bridge? - Don't go ballistic on me. - I'm not going ballistic, Claes! - All right, calm down. We must be able to talk about this. We don't want to get lawyers involved ... do we? - Dad, let's go. She's so pigheaded. - Coming. When did you get married? Way too early. I was very young and very much in love. But the humdrum soon set in. Particularly after Magnus ... Magnus? Who's Magnus? My son. You have a son? Why the hell didn't you tell me? - How old is he? - He's 15. So ... Okay, so he's 10 years younger than me. - Yes. - Let me just ... - So he's more my age than you are. - Yes, I know. Don't get mad. You're the one hiding it. I didn't hide it. You didn't ask. Ask you what? If you had a 15-year-old son called Magnus? Yes. Or... No. Come here. Yes ... I'm not sure I like that "yes". - We do split any profit, right? - Yes, in principle. In principle? Please elaborate. - Your husband has debts from a company. - Right. That's several years ago. He can deduct that from his statuory share. It amounts to 800,000 kroner. So if we make a profit of 800,000 on the house, I don't get a dime? You can negotiate a compensation if you haven't signed your instant divorce. - Instant divorce. - You have. I have to see if it's urgent. Hey, wanna go for a beer? I'll turn it off now. There. Sorry. Instant divorce, you say? So you have to pay for his old debt? Forget it. Bastard. Then maybe you are gonna live under a bridge? Yes, that may be my reality before I know it. Wait and see. Or I could tell Magnus the truth. Every little detail about how his dad's been fooling around with his teacher. He thinks his dad is a saint. Anyway, I'm home. Talk to you later. - I've got him. Look behind you! - Ult, ult, ult! - What? - Ult. - Look behind you. Got him? - Yeah. - Can I talk to you? - One second. We're playing. - Come on. - Sure. Default Noob is checking out. Remember my request. - Are you drunk? - A bit. Did you say anything? Okay. I can't be with you with Magnus here. - Don't be such a drag. - Andreas, hey. - Come on. - Andreas! What are you doing? Come and dance with me. - Come on. - You're so gorgeous. Sweet, gorgeous, sensitive Maja, look at me. Touch me. You and I are alike. Or else we're opposites. I don't know. That's what's so perfect. That's what we can. Go, Andreas. - Now ... please. - Look, I only just got here. Yes, and now you have to leave. Another day, okay? - No way. - The door is here. Come here. Andreas ... all right. I'm serious about this. - He's just a friend. - Fine, Mom. Yeah ... just a friend. Look, it's fine. Look. Why do I know what's coming? Find a girlfriend your own age. Are you scared? It's been a great time out, but the reality bell just rang. Is it because of Magnus? Andreas ... So that's it? We'll delete each other's number and never meet again? Yes. That's it. Andreas. Andreas! You're not eating anything. - I'm not hungry. - Wanna play Jack while we eat? Jack? Mom, I don't play Jack anymore. Dad said to tell you he's booked the boat club for my confirmation. And there's something else. I've been living primarily with you - - and only been with Dad every other weekend. And Dad and I talked about maybe trying ... ... switching for a while. Switching? How? It's much closer to the club and I got my own room. Oh ... Mom, what's up? It's fine, sweetie. Go ahead. It's just that I've been with you so much and hardly seen Dad. It's fine. I need to get this house sold. - Thanks for pizza, Mom. - You're welcome. Hello? 6 months later FOR SALE - When is the realtor due? - Any minute now. - Do you want this in the garage? - 40 lessons, Signe. And 12 Sunday services. I never thought he'd go through with it. You'd better go, seeing as it's your son's confirmation. - He invited Susanna, too. - Can I bring Kim? - Wednesday Kim? - I'll press on, okay? - It's on a Sunday. - Yes. So now he's both Wednesday and Sunday Kim? Sure. Or Wednesday-to-Sunday Kim, some might say. - No way. - Why not? I'll be the only single there. No way. Isn't Uncle Pede coming? He's single. He was pretty entertaining at your birthday. That laugh of his. He sounds like a walrus. - Go ahead and bring Kim. - Thanks. - Want to come over for dinner tonight? - Thanks, but I'm going out. With this guy Robert Wahl...steen. - Okay? - Tinder's cool. Swipe right and score. - So you're on Tinder? - I was on Lexotan. Now I'm on Tinder. You're still on Lexotan? A bit. - But why? - Well ... why? - Yes, why? - Because ... Magnus spends most of his time at Claes's. So I'm stuck in this shitty house. Which I love but hate when I'm alone. Sure, I understand. You said a ray of sunshine would break through one day. When is that day? Oh, there she is. Hi, Claes. I'm on my way out. When can I drop off Magnus tomorrow? Around 10? Okay, have a nice evening. Thanks. Bye. Robert! Robert, I'll be right there! BORGLUM DORMITORY Let me in! Hey! - Hello. - Andreas, it's Maja. - I need to talk to you. - You've got the wrong person. What the fuck ...? - Hello. - Maja? - There you are. - What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. - Not now. But I need to. Andreas, you were right ... - Maja, not now. - Andreas, come here. You were right about us being unique. You were right about the reality bell ringing. No. Go home and sleep it off. Okay. - You are ... - Andreas! - Sweet Maja ... - Sweet Andreas ... Go home and sleep. - Take care. - Andreas ... Andreas. - Once did I get a tiramisu ... - That wasn't soggy. That wasn't soggy but nice. Oh, it's chilly. So hurry inside. I still think it was kinda wet. Kim, look. - Who the hell is that? - It's Maja. Maja ... Maja. - I just need the key. - What are you doing? Uh ... hand me the key. - You're in my perennials. - Nah, I don't think so. - Yes, I think so. - That's ... hello. - We'd better get her inside. - Need a key for that. - Come with me. - Yup. - There you go. - Thanks a bunch, sailor. Thanks a million, Captain. - Is this Kim? - Yes, this is Kim. Wednesday Kim? You do know we call you that? Wednesday Kim. - Get her inside. - Got the key? - No, Signe does. - We call you Wednesday Kim. - Good morning. Here's your dress. - Oh thanks. - Oh dear, I called everyone. - Who? I called Claes one, two, three, four, five times. - Thank God he didn't answer. - You don't remember? I blacked out at eight. No, no, no, I called Magnus's teacher. Bitch. - Coffee? - Please. - What's that? - What? That ring? Oh. You didn't tell her? Kim ... You're shitting me. You're getting married and all that? Pass me the cheese, please. Why does it have to be so tight? These cheese packages ... There. Magnus! Magnus! Magnus, do you hear me? Do you hear me, Magnus? Maja Damtoft, 17 Hjortevaenget. My son is unconscious. Send an ambulance. We're coming in with an unconscious young man. Alert the trauma center. - Get him on ventilation. - Please sit down and fasten your belt. Yes. I'm a doctor. No ... Pick up, Claes. You've reached Claes Damtoft. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Claes, it's Maja. Magnus is in the hospital. Call me. -I can't... He's my son. - I know. I forgot he was coming over. Hey ... We're taking care of him. I've stabilized him. Have you noticed a change in his behavior recently? - He's impacted by our divorce. - And physically? He's growing fast. - What's going on? - He has ketoacidosis and is dehydrated. - He has diabetes? - Yes, type 1 diabetes, I'm afraid. Has he shown any symptoms? Fatigue, dizziness, weight loss? How could I have been so blind! Don't knock yourself. Hi, sweetie. What's going on? You passed out. - The doctors think you're diabetic. - Diabetic? So do I have to ... inject myself? Don't worry about that now. Just relax, sweetie. - Where's Dad? - He's on his way. From Poland. - I thought diabetes was hereditary. - Yeah. It can target doctor's sons whose moms have their head too far up their ass. Is that why I've been so tired? Sweetie ... I'm sorry. - How are you doing? - Okay. You got me something? - Just a little something. - From Poland? Warzaw. - Awesome. Are you gonna do that? - Maybe. I don't know. Your Snapchat is red-hot. Whenever you swipe, it goes ... Your numbers look good. You're going to be fine. - Good. Isn't that great, sweetie? - I need to go to the bathroom. Let me give you a hand. Postponement of dissertation - Claes. - Hi. - I need to talk to you about something. - Oh, I'll just ... No, please stay, Susanna. It's about Magnus's confirmation. - Let's go through with it. - Will he be out in a week and a half? Let's put our differences aside and do our utmost not to make it awkward. - But I canceled the boat club. - We'll do it in my garden. Are you up for it, what with the house sale and everything? - It's not for sale. I accepted the bid. - That's great! Yeah, well, okay. I won't be put on a sour face. Not toward you either, Susanna. Why don't we ... We'll cook. You have enough on your plate. I just took a cooking class and learnt all these vegetarian dishes. Otto Lenghi-style. - Yes. - Well, that's the deal, then. Great. SOLD - It's fine here. - Yes. - I think this is lower. - It's all gooey. It's a little lower. Aw! - Did you hurt yourself? - I pinched my hand. - Stupid crap. - Blood blister. Just needs 7 stitches. - Okay. - This is right. - See ... - Lift it. - Lower and wider. - It's for the short people. - Where's Magnus? - At a LAN party. He was adamant about going on his own. He won't let me help him with anything. He's still punishing me. - Oh well ... - Cheers. - Cheers. You look a bit haggard, Claes. How are you doing? Well, to be honest, I have some stuff on my mind. Oh, again? Well, I'm reflecting on - - how my life suddenly split in two. One part of me was a dreary family guy - - and the other part chased dubious women. But that was your own choice. Yes, you're right. It's just that ... I don't know when it started. It just kinda happened. I feel really bad about it. I don't understand why I didn't bust you. Particularly with the teacher. Oh, I'd almost forgotten about her. Well, you got yourself a piece of young ass there. The sex was really lousy. I cringe just thinking about it. Thank God you moved on and found love again. Yes ... I'd better get going. Susanna's been to the organic farm. We gotta be ready for Sunday. - Thanks for helping out. - Don't mention it. - Claes, for fuck's sake. - You're right. Sorry. Just ... Forget it. Thanks for last night. Claes Hi, sweetie. - Fun night? And your insulin? - It's fine. Good. Look. Aren't you excited? - Anything wrong? - The pastor sent an email. Oh? It's central to our teaching and guiding - - for the confirmand to come to the house of God - - and reflect on whether he can affirm his Christian baptism. Absolutely, but the thing is - - he's been in the hospital for two weeks with diabetes. - I see. Oh dear. - Maybe you can make an exception? But he only attended one service. But he really liked the preparation. Not to mention all your chats about God and Jesus and all the rest. He'll be happy to hear that we have classes this fall - - where he'll have ample opportunity to learn not just fragments - - but the entire story of Christ. - In the fall? - Yes, in the fall. - Mom, stop. - I just don't believe it. - I don't care, okay? - What are your friends gonna say? Nothing. I'll go see them in church tomorrow. - We'll throw you the party anyway. - Just drop it, Mom. So you got your way with that confirmation. ... at the right hand of the father; who will return to judge - - both the living and the dead. We believe in the Holy Spirit, in the Church of Jesus Christ - - the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body - - and life everlasting. Amen. Anders Dalby Skousen, do you affirm your faith in Jesus Christ? Yes. Magnus. Come on. - What? - It's time. - For what? - Come on. Amen. Maja, we had a good meeting about ... Can I have that? Magnus Damtoft, do you affirm your faith in Jesus Christ? - What do you think you're doing? - Do you? Yes. Yes, please. Sit down. May the Almighty God, father of Jesus Christ, give you faith and hope. May he bless and keep you in his love. Amen. Amen! - Hi. - Hi. Congratulations on Magnus. There are drinks in the garden. Hi. Here comes the food. Pesticide-free and there's lots more to come. - Thanks, Susanna. - No, thank Otto. The tables are ready. - So, the big day has come. - Yes. - Those are delicious. - I'm not sure if ... - They look good. - They sure do. Yummy, Pede! That's odd. Dear friends. I apologize to all of those who didn't get to see ... ... the confirmation, or whatever you might call it, at the church. In fact, I didn't think I'd make the confirmation. But that stupid diabetes and ... It's not like it's been a great year. With the divorce and everything. But seriously, I'm fucking stoked about all the gifts - - and about seeing all of you here today. Susanna, you've treated us all to a great meal. Thank you. And you, Dad - - you provided the tent for the party. Thank you. And then ... Mom. I just want to say that ... ... even though it's fucking annoying to have a stubborn mom like you ... ... it still reassures you that we're gonna get through. Through it all. Maybe not best in style, but ... Fuck that, right, Mom? Yeah, thanks. And so let's raise our glasses, if someone has an extra strong soda for me. Well ... thanks, Pede. - Cheers. - Cheers. Great speech. Well done. You fucking wonderful boy. - You fucking crazy woman. - Come here. - Thanks for a great party. - Thank you, Susanna. Thanks for the great ... veggie lasagna. It's the least I could do. There's lots left, so ... Bye. Thanks for the presents. And we didn't get a chance to talk. - Some other day, then. - Some other day. Right. I'll go get the car. Bye. Bye. Drive safely. Okay. I know my timing is poor, but ... If I apologize a billion times for being such a bastard - - would you give it another shot? - Get home safely. - Thanks for the presents. - Imagine how happy Magnus would be. - Yeah ... Claes, I already forgave you for leaving me. And I know you'll always be the best dad for Magnus. Always. But you're panicking right now. Claes ... I wish all the best for you. But it's not gonna happen. - Does that make any sense? - Yes, I'm afraid so. Magnus. There. "We announce that your dissertation has been accepted for defense." - Congratulations, Mom. - Thanks, sweetie. - Have fun tonight. - You too. Subtitles: Goldberg and Kristiansen Dansk Video Tekst
