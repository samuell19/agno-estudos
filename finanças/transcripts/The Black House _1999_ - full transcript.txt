Yes, that's fine with us. So we look forward to working with you. Ah, yes. Forget it! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Please wait! Sir! There have been a lot of deaths today, haven't there? This is from the fire in Teramachi. All five members of the family died. Fifteen cases showed up at once claiming the death insurance money. So the number blew up. Most of them had endowment insurance with a high interest rate and a five-yearterm. Manager Wakatsuki, please check this. So you brought out a hot drink, right? Yes. Okay. When a problematic customer comes instead of a hot one, you bring out a cold one. Why is that? Because that would cool off their hot head, right? I understand. I will be careful. I'm beat. I'm beat. I appreciate your efforts. That was arson, right? Did they catch the culprit? Not yet. But the chances that the beneficiary took part in it are low, so I'm sure there aren't going to be any problems with the payment. Good grief. Manager Wakatsuki. Please check these. When I went the other day, he wasn't in his hospital room. So I casually asked one of the patients in the same room as him. Apparently, he's at the pachinko hall every day in the afternoon. Not an unusual pattern. But is it true that the hospital conspired with him too? This place is the famous ''moral risk'' hospital. It's for those that want to commit hospitalization benefits fraud just as the name implies. Shall we get going? I guess we should. Yo, what is this guy trying to say? Well... It's about the name of the disease. Since you came here, it has changed twice already, right? First it was a gastric stomach ulcer, but while you were hospitalized, a liver impairment showed up, and now it's diabetes mellitus? What's wrong with that? After the examination, they found more things wrong with me. I see. But even so, the limit of the benefits payment due to hospitalization is 120 days each. Somehow, when exactly 120 days passes, the disease changes. I'm borrowing your ashtray. If you have a problem, ask the hospital! That's what the doctor has diagnosed it as! May I get your signature on this? What the hell is this? It's an agreement form for cancellation of the contract. Don't underestimate me! Who do you think I am? You want me to send you off somewhere? ls it okay? Can't he just send me off somewhere? By us making him that mad, wouldn't it become a hassle later?. It's fine. The head office has already decided the contract cancellation plan. But if it turns into a trial from here... Ourjob is already done. The head office has hired a scrapper. lnput this for me. Okay. Hey, I heard. Apparently you made it clear, right? Hello, hello. I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Miyoshi. Thanks. Mr. Wakatsuki, right? I came to give you this. Agreement for Cancellation of lnsurance Contract You were able to do it that fast? But I can't believe he actually agreed to it. You make them agree to it. It was an easy one. We'll be saved thanks to you. Well, I'm off. Ah, Mr. Miyoshi. After this, are you going somewhere else? To the Kokura area in Kyushu. With the Thunderbird and the bullet train. For a matter with another life insurance company though. Mr. Kasai, it's hot, huh? Yeah. That man has this intensity, right? Yeah. He's a little different from a normal person. Apparently he used to be full-fledged yakuza. Rumor says that he quit the business when he was getting married. He was having a hard time getting a decent job, but the president of Insurance Data Service picked him up for his talent. His talent, huh? Without a doubt, the seal stamped on the application form is about two mm bigger in circumference. Yes. So I told him that he cannot apply for a contractor's loan with that seal. Then he came in with the person that's standing behind him. Because he wasn't able to receive the loan, the bill was dishonored and his company went bankrupt. Then he says that we need to pay him 50 million yen as compensation. Ah, it's okay. I'll go talk to them. Whatever the guy behind him is, whether a creditor or something else, he most likely put an idea into his head. I'm sorry. Don't cry or anything, okay? Yes. Manager Wakatsuki. It's an inquiry from a customer. ls it something complicated? Well, she's asking if insurance pays out if someone commits suicide. Hello? I'm sorry to make you wait. My name is Wakatsuki, manager in charge of the teller window. It's about your inquiry, but may I ask what you were inquiring about? I already told them before. Yes. Does insurance pay out when the person commits suicide? Well, if you have your insurance policy and tell me the number that's written on there, then I can look it up for you right away. If you don't have that, you won't be able to tell? Yes. There are cases where we are and aren't able to pay. What would be a case that's not possible? Well, in general, within a year of joining, suicide is exempted from responsibilities. Exempted? Meaning you are not able to receive payment. Why is that? Well... ln business, regarding suicide in general, it's exempted, but in the insurance agreement in general, it's cut off at one year. Wait! Don't hang up. Please hold on for a second. It might be unnecessary, and if I'm wrong, please forgive me. Please listen without getting offended. Miss, are you thinking of committing suicide? If that is so, please think it over one more time. It may be intrusive, but by committing suicide, your family may be able to receive the insurance money. However, for the ones who are left behind... You, what did you say your name was? My name is Wakatsuki. Have you been working there for a while now? No, it's only been about a year since I came to this branch. Really? Thank you. Manager Wakatsuki. Yes? There was a phone call from a man named Shigenori Komoda. Know him? I've never heard his name. Regardless, you've been requested. He deliberately mentioned your name and asked for you to come. Hello. Hello? Do you have some business? I'm Wakatsuki from Shouwa Life Hokuriku Branch. Are you Mr. Komoda? We apparently got a phone call from you. Ah, that's right. Wait, no one was there? Yes. It seemed as if no one was home. That's weird. Wait a moment. Oh, Kenta, were you lonely? Did you want to see Daddy? Oh, really? Eat up, eat up. Hey, Junko. You come over here too. Come on, Junko, eat up. It's messy, but come in. Excuse me. What is this? Hey, Kazuya, you're home, aren't you? Kazuya! Kazuya! Come on. Yes. I'm sorry to make you wait. Not at all. I just got here. It seems as if our business office upset you, and I would like to apologize about that. I'm sure it's hard for you too. Sorry to impose. Unfortunately my wife is out right now, and I don't even know where the tea leaves are. Please don't fuss over me. Hey, Kazuya. If you're here, come here for a second. Kazuya! Why are you ignoring me when there's company! It's rude to our company! Kazuya! No, please don't bother. Could you open that sliding screen for a second? Excuse me? Over there. Kazuya should be right there. He's a shy kid just like me. I understand. I beg you. Could you say something to him? Okay. Here I go. Kazuya, right? Yeah, Kazuya. Hello? Kazuya? Hello? lnsured: Kazuya Komoda Beneficiary: Shigenori Komoda I heard this contract itself wasn't something made at our office. The recruiter was from Toyama's Shinminato office. The contract's a year and a half old and was transferred to us last year. What kind of person is the recruiter?. She quit already, but she lives in Shinminato City Nakafushiki. Her name is Mitsuyo Ounishi, age 38, a homemaker. What kind of relation does she have with Komoda? Yes, Sachiko Komoda is the wife. Nakafushiki is this Sachiko's birthplace, and Mitsuyo Ounishi and her were classmates in elementary school. But... There is a little problem with how this recruiting started. Problem? Yes, when Mitsuyo Ounishi went into a pachinko hall in the city, that was when she accidentally ran into Sachiko Komoda. Well, she wasn't able to get a contract, so apparently she was desperate for anything. Sachiko? Aren't you Sachiko? Hey, do you play pachinko often? I also play a lot in between work. If so, what about this one? While they were chatting, she complained that the quota was too high, and that's when she gave her the business card. With this one, if you die before you're 60, you'll get 30,000,000! Three days later, the husband Shigenori Komoda called the office and said that they would buy insurance. lnsured Person Then they were suspicious of moral risk from the beginning? Yes. On top of that, it's three cases joining at once. The policy had the Komoda couple each having 30,000,000 yen and the child having 5,000,000. It's a fully-equipped rider and a total monthly payment of 61 ,872 yen. Why didn't the Toyama branch check when they were joining? The recruitment was in November two years ago. November, huh? November Campaign Period Manager Wakatsuki. Yes? What's going on with dealing with the complaint? There's nothing that they could pick at later, is there? On that, I asked the staff member in charge, but no complaint came to mind. It's an excuse. ln other words, it's like this. They just wanted to call Wakatsuki and make him the primary discoverer. They strangled their own child to death. An accident due to the contractor's intention Vice-director Ousako. That's wrong. Kazuya Komoda was Sachiko Komoda's child from a previous marriage. Did you hear that from the police? The father is unknown, but Shigenori Komoda got married to Sachiko two years ago, and his former name was Shigenori Kosaka. Shigenori Kosaka Left thumb severed, 5,000,000 yen Oh, man... This guy's notorious. It's Komoda. When I searched for him with his former name, Shigenori Kosaka, there was a contract with him, though it's lapsed. This guy was the Finger Hunting Tribe's remnant. Finger Hunting Tribe? You've never heard of them? The people that severed off their own fingers to collect injury benefits. Left thumb severed, 5,000,000 yen Shouwa Life Thank you for waiting. My name is Wakatsuki, in charge of insurance. Kazuya's life insurance. It's not coming out yet? I'm very sorry about your loss at this time, and my deepest sympathy goes out to you. Regarding Mr. Kazuya Komoda's life insurance, at this moment, the head office is investigating. If you could wait a little bit more. Head office? It's not here? No. Why is it taking this much time? There were a couple of things that had to be confirmed. On what? To be honest, the death certificate that was submitted said that the cause of death wasn't suicide, but unknown. Because of that, it's essential for us to confirm with the police. What are you going to confirm? Therefore... What are you saying? Huh? Didn't you see it for yourself?. Weren't you the one that found Kazuya's body? That's true, but unfortunately that's not enough. The insurance money... If you don't pay us soon, we'll be in trouble. We still have to have a funeral for him. And we also have to pay for a couple of other things. But why him? We sympathize with your feelings. We will demand that the head office hurry with their decision. But you gave me a spare key, so there's a chance I'll sneak in late. Please take care. Megumi The magumi that Megumi likes. That man is here again today. That man? The man with the work glove. Around what time was it? Around 12:05 PM. Vice chief Kasai tried dealing with him, but he kept on pressing and saying, ''I've always talked to Manager Wakatsuki.'' Thanks. Hello, thank you for waiting. It's about Kazuya's insurance money, but I thought it could have been paid out already, you know? About that, it's still under investigation at the head office. Could you please wait for a little longer? Oh, really? It's not ready yet? I'm very sorry that we're making you wait so long. Oh, really? It's not ready yet? Once the decision is made, we will contact you. Oh, really? It's not ready yet? Thank you for waiting. Oh, really? It's not ready yet? Really? He came again today? Yes. He's not yelling or crying, right? Well... ''Oh, really? It's not ready yet?'' is the only thing he repeats constantly. So he only repeats, ''Oh, really? It's not ready yet?'' huh? Yes. They think this is a war of nerves. Two weeks have passed since the day after his wife showed up. It's amazing that he keeps on coming. The head office hasn't said anything yet? Not yet. The police will make a full decision based on their attitude. Vice Director of domestic affairs. If it's possible, can I look into this matter a little bit more? What are you going to do specifically? First of all, I would like to see the recruiter and get her story directly. Apparently she is Sachiko Komoda's childhood friend. ls it going to be okay? I don't think it's going to be okay, though. Um, I'm the one who gave you a call this morning. Wakatsuki from the Hokuriku branch. I need to go pick up my child right now. I need to go pick up my child right now. No problem. It's fine while we walk. No problem. It's fine while we walk. Okay. It's hot, isn't it? Where did you go to elementary school? West Nakafushiki Elementary School, located along the highway. So you were together for six years there? Yes. But I never really talked to Ms. Komoda. She was always alone in class. Also, she didn't have a mother. What happened to her mother? It's a rumor, but I've heard that she eloped with another man. Because of that, it seemed the father was looking after her, but there were times she had traces of abuse on her arms and back. Traces of abuse? Kind of like that. And for Mr. Kosaka, there were scary parts to him. Hold on a second please. When you say Mr. Kosaka Ms. Komoda's husband was in the same school? Yes, he was in the same class. I think the census said he was in Kyushu, Fukuoka though. I think Mr. Kosaka lived alone with his grandmother, but after she passed, I heard that he was going all over the country alone. You said before that there was a scary part to him. Did something specific happen? I don't know if I should even be saying this, but during a field trip that we took in 6th grade, one girl from another class went missing. It turned into an uproar to go look for her all over town. But in the end, they found her floating in a pond. So were they thinking that he did it? There were rumors like that. A little before that, Mr. Kosaka was insistently following her around. Because of that, the teacher asked him a lot of different things. Then all of a sudden, there was testimony that he was with her the whole time, and that's when the suspicion was cleared. He had an alibi? Yes. The one that testified then was Ms. Sachiko Komoda. It's already been about 30 years. Also, I came back here last year, so I can't really remember specifically about that girl Sachiko Komoda. I've heard that she didn't really stand out that much. Do you remember anything about Shigenori Kosaka? I vaguely remember him. He was a child with some problems. This is the collection of work from that class when they were in fifth grade. I thought I should get them to have better writing skills, so for the class that I was in charge of, I made sure we made one of these. But it's amazing it was still here. The dreams of the future, huh? No. Dreams are dreams, but these are the dreams you see when you sleep. If it's that topic, even the kids that hate essays write really unique sentences. Dream. By Shigenori Kosaka. Grandma told me that people who passed away come to see you in dreams. And I was happy because Mom and Dad were looking at me in my dream. But I can't see them anymore. I wanted them to come see me one more time, but they won't even come into my dreams anymore. The end. Manager Wakatsuki, the man with the gloves is here. Oh really? It's not ready yet? I'm very sorry. Not yet... Yes? We haven't even given him a funeral. We don't even have money to get a priest. At least a funeral, that's all we can do for him. Because we did a pitiful thing to Kazuya. We don't even have a small amount left anymore. We can't do anything about it. Where do you live? Excuse me? Well, in the city, but... Where in the city? Um, regarding that, I'm not allowed to answer that. Why's that? That's the policy we have. Mr. Komoda! Please stop! Hey! Please stop! Are you okay? What happened all of a sudden? I'm sorry. I remembered about Kazuya. It was pitiful and painful, so I bit down by mistake. Okay, I understand, but please stop! Please calm down! Megumi... Megumi... It's okay. I'm really happy just staying like this. What's wrong? Just a second. This is assistant professor Mr. Kaneishi. When I talked to my professor about you, he called Mr. Kaneishi over. He specializes in criminal psychology. I'm sorry to ask you something unreasonable. I've heard the general story from Ms. Kurosawa. It might be a bit early, but, Mr. Kaneishi, how would you analyze this person K's profile? It seems to me... If K is actually committing these murders, then he is lacking functions like compassion, conscience, and regret. He definitely has schizoid personality disorder. Schizoid personality disorder? Also, there's a chance that impulse control disorder and intermittent explosive disorder are mixed together. Meaning antisocial personality disorder?. That is? There are different categories to personality disorders, but in situations with schizoid personality and control deficiency, and explosive disorder especially, we call it antisocial personality disorder. It is possible that they will repeat serious crimes over and over, meaning it's the worst combination ever. Looking at this essay, his intelligence may be behind for a fifth grader, but I don't really get the impression of lacking emotions at all. How about S's ''dream of the swings''? Well... Compared to K's ''dream,'' S is more monotonous, or more like the impression is weak. But something has been on my mind. I think I have heard about a dream similar to this somewhere. ''Dream of the swings.'' I got on the swings and swung. While I was swinging on the swing, eventually I got more acceleration, and I was able to get closer to the top. I got so high that I could swing in a full circle. When it got to the highest point, I slipped and fell off the swing. From there, I fell into a deep, empty place farther and farther down. So you're against that guy Kaneishi's opinions? Of course I'm not denying all of it, but I have a resistance to words that label people in categories. Since I started studying psychology, do you know what the most important thing I've learned is? No. Each and every human being is totally different. And how it is an extremely intricate universe. Mr. Wakatsuki, do you really think a human that doesn't have a humanlike heart exists in this world? I do. Why is that? That's because you have never met a human like that. Be at an insurance company every day and meet some worthless humans. You would too. It just seems like that because of the stress from your job. It's the same as your body not moving the way you want it to. I'm sorry. It's okay. But I think it's definitely wrong. I think K has a humanlike heart too. Why do you think that? It's that essay. The child that wrote that definitely isn't a monster. I leave the rest up to your imagination. Brother! Hasn't it been enough? Please pardon us! Please pardon us! I'm very sorry. We paid the premium. Didn't we pay the expensive premium by pushing ourselves? Even after all that, when Kazuya dies, you're saying that you're not going to pay the insurance? I'm very sorry. You scared me. I appreciate your effort. I was so overwhelmed. He was really persistent today. I'm not surprised by this anymore, but there was another guy here to see you until just a moment ago. It was this guy with no composure and a pale face. I think he said his name was Kaneishi or something. Do you know him? Yes, but I think it was more regarding a personal issue. That guy was eagerly trying to talk with Komoda. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sure you know too, but customers talking with each other, even if it's small talk, is not something we really want happening. And if new troubles occur, even if we're not involved, it would be a hassle. Much less so since it's that guy. If it's someone you know, then could you tell him the matter? I understand. Are you okay? Ah, yeah, well... What did you talk about with that man? I was right. That is the person K you were speaking of, huh? Nothing really important. I said things like, ''lsn't it humid?'' but he pretty much wouldn't answer me. He's pretty expressionless, so it's hard to figure it out, but I perceived it as him having been driven into a wall. I don't remember asking to go that far. Having you come to the branch office and talking to him is trouble. Also, I think he's close to his limit. Are you even listening? I'll give it to you straight. There is a danger that that man will kill you. You don't say... I don't think he has any motive to kill me. It's not like he's going to get the insurance money by killing me. That is the thought process of normal humans like us. He doesn't think that way. ls that because he has antisocial personality disorder? More commonly known as a psychopath. Psychopath? They don't even bear affection to their own children. You think a human like that would have affection towards unrelated people? On top of that, he may be abnormal, but he's not mentally challenged. He is always sane. Even though he's sane, for the purpose of filling their own desires, there are humans that will not hesitate to commit a crime. Did you know how much these types of humans are increasing in this country? I don't know if you have any interest in it, but there is a viewpoint saying the primary factor is the environment. Are you talking about environmental pollution? That's right. Chemicals such as agricultural chemicals. Chemical substances that are included in factory products and drainage. Dioxin that comes out of garbage incineration factories. Food additives that have been put in a situation to be left out. I think that all these things combined damages the human DNA and become the riding spur for the increase in psychopaths. The scarier thing is that ''psychopath-like values'' is a spreading disease amongst the youth now. As the numbers of humans that act upon psychopath-like actions increases, it becomes a protective coloration, and real psychopaths start to not stand out. From now on, there are going to be more real psychopaths activated. Yes? Hello? What's wrong? Are you okay? Megumi. I'm sorry about the other day. Why are you apologizing? I was the one who said a horrible thing. No... It was kind of hard for me to call, so that's why I wrote a letter. A letter?. You didn't read it? No. I didn't even get it yet. That's strange. I sent it out about 5 days ago. What did you write? Because I wanted to apologize about the other day. Too much splashing. Too much splashing. ls that so! Thank you so much. We have been saved. Mr. Wakatsuki, thank you so much for doing a great job for us. This really helped us a lot. What is the meaning of this? Exactly how you see it. The head office decided on the payout. The police officially commented to the head office's inquiry that Kazuya Komoda's death was suicide. But maybe it was good. Because now the issue has been settled. ls it really an issue that's been settled? What? Maybe this is only the start of things. What do you mean? There are still two contracts left with Shigenori and Sachiko Komoda. On top of that, each one of them is 30,000,000 yen. Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that they're going to do it again? Whatever the circumstances might be, they just get whatever they can. I'm sure even they know that the police are keeping track of them, you know? The things that they come up with and their nerves are different from normal human beings in the first place. Do you have a basis for saying something like that? There is no need for him to have insurance. ln spite of that, he applied of his own will for insurance. And even though he's saying that he's having a rough time with money, he kept on paying the high premiums without any hesitation. I can only think that he was planning insurance fraud from the beginning. So then you're saying that he's going to kill his wife next? Vice-director Ousako, you shouldn't say reckless things like that. Manager Wakatsuki, as I said before, the police decided Komoda is not guilty. If you decide someone's a killer with just speculation, it can become defamation. Reissue Changing Seals Payments Not Received Payments Unpaid Sachiko Sachiko Komoda Lost Certificates Formal Receipt Kazuya He did not commit suicide. lnsurance Money Asset Formation Payment Please be careful. Missing lnsurance Policy Large Sum lnsurance Premium Payment Deposit Overtime, huh? You're always working hard. I'm sorry. I think it will take me a little longer still. I understand. I will be in the security room, so if there is anything, please tell me. Ah, thank you very much. Dear Mrs. Sachiko Komoda. I'm sure receiving a letter like this surprised you. My condolences go out to you about Kazuya passing away in June. But Kazuya did not commit suicide. I am someone who works for the police, but due to a certain reason, I believe that Kazuya was murdered by Mr. Shigenori Komoda. What I am worried about is the fact that there is insurance on you also. If we leave it like this, I thought you would be murdered also, so that is why I wrote this letter to you. Kanazawa Kourinbou Post Office NTTKourinbou Building You may not be able to believe it, but please think about it thoroughly once. If you cannot divorce Shigenori, then you should change the beneficiary of the insurance to someone else. Or you may want to even cancel the contract. Please be careful. Sincerely yours. Get my sunglasses for me. It's bright out here. Murder. Kanazawa Naka Police Station At this point, there is nothing to identify this person with. His clothes are torn off, and he doesn't have glasses, a watch, or anything. When we searched the surroundings, the only thing we found was your business card, Mr. Wakatsuki. Well, we don't have positive proof that it's related to the body, but it could be a customer that came to your office or something. Could you take look? Are you okay? Yes. I am now. I'm sorry. C-Can I look at h-his left wrist please? You got an idea who it is? What is with these wounds? Are you done now? We think that they were confined somewhere for about a week to ten days. During that time, they were tortured and given nothing but water. So who is this person? Kaneishi. Mr. Katsumi Kaneishi. My alma mater's psychology teacher. Are you saying the one who murdered Mr. Kaneishi is Shigenori Komoda? Who else could it be? He will kill his wife too. There is a 30,000,000-yen insurance plan on her. I can't really understand what you're saying. Just for argument's sake, just for argument's sake, let's say Shigenori Komoda is thinking of murdering his wife, Sachiko. Then why is there a need to pull all these pranks on you? That is... Right? He's already received Kazuya Komoda's insurance money. Why did you think Shigenori Komoda was guilty in the first place? Because when Kazuya's body was in front of you, he was watching your reaction? On top of that, Kazuya Komoda was Sachiko's child from her last marriage. Could you have thought that up because of those factors? If it were the real parents, you don't want to think they would go that far. What's wrong, Megumi? I read over the essays. I'll tell you the conclusion. The dream that's written about in the essay was absolutely abnormal. But not K's dream. I'm talking about S's ''dream of the swings.'' As Jung said, in a dream, the sky and the earth symbolize the spectrum of both extremities of unconsciousness. To move within there precipitously should create tremendous stress to the human being. But this child is not feeling any uneasiness at all. Especially in the last part where she is falling into the darkness. A normal human would be feeling fear. But it's only a description of the movement, and you don't see any words that point out emotional reaction, right? A man named Von Franz analyzed a dream exactly like this one. And what did that person say? This human being has no heart. Would you go this far normally? Whichever way, because the claim is up now, we have to cope with it. Could you go see? I'll go this time. I'll go this time. No. This is a case that I have been in charge of from the beginning. So please let me see it through to the end. Shigenori Komoda My husband was really enjoying this snack you gave to us the last time. Thank you. No problem. So, we are aware of most of the things with the medical certificate, but could we hear the details on how it resulted in the accident? My husband has been working using a cutting machine at the factory. Apparently, last Tuesday, the machine wasn't working right. So he stayed alone after work to do some maintenance on it. Because he was dazed, he forgot to put the stopper on the blade. Due to something, the switch turned on. And because of that, his body has turned into this. He was putting overtime in because his boss ordered him to? Even if that's not the case, there are times you stay, right? May I ask who was the one that found the accident? It was me. It was already late at night, so no one was left at the factory. For what reason did you go to the factory? My husband didn't come home, so I went to go check up on him. It was when the accident had just happened. If I had gotten there a few seconds later, it would've been really bad. What is going on with you? I'm sorry. We need to report the details to our higher-ups. About the insurance payout... How much will be paid? Well... As long as there are no issues with the circumstances of the accident, as a high-grade-accident-insurance payout, 30,000,000 yen will be paid. What would be an issue? Unlike with Kazuya, I want you to pay us soon without complaining. It hurts. Hurts... What? It hurts. What? Where does it hurt? Where does it hurt? My hand. Huh? The tip of my finger hurts. The tip of yourfingers? The tip of yourfingers? Look, the poor thing. He now has a body that can't work for the rest of his life. And on top of that, he's gone insane. Phantom pain, that's what it's called. It's pain that you feel all of a sudden. Your husband hasn't gone insane. Mr. Wakatsuki. We're going to get going now. Please take care. Ah, wait a second. You said I could get that high-grade accident. But if my husband dies, would I get another insurance payout? If the emergency-team member found the severed arm right away, then reattachment of the limb would have been possible. Was the arm actually found? Yes, about four to five hours later, the wife found it and brought it. If you wrap it in a plastic bag and ice, it usually lasts about six to twelve hours. But she brought it bare and wrapped in newspaper. To be honest... Before Kazuya died, there was a time she called the company anonymously. She asked if insurance would be paid out even with suicides. I just assumed that it was for her to die on her own. She has that kind of personality, so I started thinking that she was just going by what her husband had said. But... That wasn't an inquiry for if she dies. Regardless, I told her things that she shouldn't have known. Because I didn't go exactly by the manual, our branch... No, Showa Life itself, I made her think we're nothing to be afraid of. That's an amazing thing that eyed you. She's not human. I talked to the vice-director of domestic affairs about it. They are going to go with the direction to scrap the contract. I've never seen anyone that has gone this far before. I guess you can say you're brave. But, lady, you've gone too far. This is definitely way too much. If it's just like one finger, then we would close our eyes for that one. It's a ''thanks for your effort'' payment. But taking both arms and 30,000,000 is a little heartless, don't you think? What's up with you coming all of a sudden? With insurance comes a thing called the agreement. If it's too hard to read because of its small lettering, there is a digest version. Lady, did you read that carefully? Kettle? Not a kettle. An agreement. When did I say kettle? It's this, but it's not a kettle. Agreement This is the usual thing, but... This is the usual thing, but... Thank you very much. By the way, why did it all of a sudden change from Kyoto to Kanazawa? I'm actually not sure either... I'm actually not sure either... It's the Hokuriku branch's Wakatsuki. I'm sorry to contact you so many times. Ms. Ounishi, you said the other day Mrs. Sachiko Komoda and Shigenori's marriage was their second, right? Do you know the name of her ex-husband? I think it was Mr. Shirakawa. I think he was someone from the city of Takaoka. For your situations, severing off your husband's arms fits into this ''insurance holder's intent'' or ''the insured's intent.'' Therefore, we won't pay out your insurance. I don't know if it's tender passion or love, but where do you have that proof?. If you have it, then show me. Proof, huh? It will be found gradually. Sachiko Shirakawa. Date of Birth: June 4th, 1961 lnsured: Yoshio Shirakawa Code: Ka YChild lnsurance "Wakaba" Child insurance? Deceased: Yoshio Shirakawa Payout Confirmed Yoshio Shirakawa, age 6. Accident reason code, 963. 963? Um, 963. 963 Death from hanging oneself, strangling, suffocation from violence Death from hanging oneself, strangling, as well as suffocation from violence. Kazuya, your bait's been eaten. 963 Death from hanging oneself, strangling, suffocation from violence Kazuya. If you go up higher, everything looks different. 963 Death from hanging oneself, strangling, suffocation from violence So this is what I'm saying, lady. If we have a trial, it's going to cost both of us our time and money. If you sign and seal here, we have no intention of making things more difficult. This is an agreement form that will make it so that the insurance never existed. We won't pay the high-grade accident insurance pay out, but you'll get back the full amount you've paid towards that insurance till now. lsn't it a good deal? Well... I feel bad for the husband, but think about if the lady has to go to jail. I get it. You were asked to do this by that guy, Wakatsuki, right? Huh? What are you saying, lady? Okay. But unfortunately, I don't have the seal here. Come with me. How? Hello, this is Wakatsuki. I'm not home... The room monitor will be activated. Damn it. What a grudge. Making money behind my back. Taking so much money from us. Hurry up and come home. I'll chop you up into pieces. I'll do this to you. I'll do this to you. Your lover is at my house, waiting for you to die. Hello, is this the police? May I speak to the detective division's Mr. Matsui? Hello, who is this calling? Just please contact Officer Matsui! Megumi was... Megumi Kurosawa was kidnapped by Sachiko Komoda. Megumi, Megumi... Megumi! Megumi! Megumi? Megu... Megumi? Megumi? Mr. Miyoshi! Mr. Miyoshi! Megumi. Megumi. Megumi! Megumi. Megumi. It's me. It's me. Megumi, it's me. It's me. It's me. It's okay. It's okay. Megumi! Megumi! It's okay. It's okay, Megumi. Let's get out here. The dismembered body found in the floor of a factory worker's home was identified as private company Tokyo Komagome insurance data service investigator Shigeru Miyoshi, age 42, on the 9th by the lshikawa prefecture Kanazawa's Naka police force. The investigation headquarters was investigating the worker's wife Sachiko Komoda, age 37, as a suspect, and from the state of the scene, it seems that all the murders were committed in the house. From the floors of the home, they found more bodies that have turned into skeletons other than Mr. Miyoshi's. Out of those, the only one that has been identified is Sachiko Komoda's former husband, Mr. lsamu Shirakawa, at the time age 30. The rest is still being investigated. There was a chance the suspect that fled from the scene fell into the canal along with the carthat she used for her escape. A large-scale investigation is currently being carried out, but Sachiko Komoda's body has yet to be found. I'm sorry to call so many times. I was just wondering how Megumi's doing. You don't have to worry about her anymore. That's what my husband has told me to tell you so many times already. May I please speak with Megumi for a little bit? Megumi is still resting. I was wondering if I could visit her once. Could you please leave her alone from now on? Please don't call anymore either. We need you to consider what happened. Yes, I know that, but... Yes, I know that, but... Please, I'm asking you. Please, I'm asking you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Excuse me... Next is the Hyakumangoku Festival that is starting in Kanazawa City. This year, Toshiie Maeda, the star of Hyakumangoku March, is going to be played by actor Ken Takada, and about 420 people will be part of this parade to enter the fortress, and the luxurious story will be told there. This year before the Hyakumangoku Parade, the 50th Government Fire Fighting Anniversary Parade will be going on, so the crosswalk restriction time will be 20 minutes earlier than last year. For more information... Yes, this is Shouwa Life. This is Takakura from the Kanazawa east business office. Thank you for your continued support. I have a special favor I would like to discuss with you, Manager Wakatsuki. What is the matter regarding? Anyhow, I would like to meet with you tonight at 10 PM. 10 PM, please. Ah, yes. I understand. Manager Wakatsuki. ls something wrong? Well, I just went to count the people here for the beginner's class, and the number of lunch boxes doesn't match. You got extras? If so, then I'll eat it. If there were extras that's fine, but we're one short. I don't know what to do. Okay, I'll do something about it. Please, thank you. What happened? What happened? It's fine. They've done a pretty flashy job, huh? Today is Hyakumangoku Festival, so you should come with me for once. Why don't we go chug some cold ones? Unfortunately, I just got a phone call from Ms. Takakura, and she apparently has something she wants to discuss with me. That's a weird thing. Why does old lady Takakura have to discuss something with you specifically? I don't know. But she said it's going to be around 10 PM. 10 PM? You took it? If it's Ms. Takakura, I can't say no. Oh really? She is a person with an excellent record, even on the country's ranking. How troublesome for you. I'll be fine. Please invite me again. Yeah. Overtime, huh? You're always working hard. I'm sorry. I understand. I will be in the security room, so if there is anything, please tell me. Yes. Too much splashing. Too much splashing. Too much splashing. Too much splashing. Too much splashing. I was cut too. When I was asleep, my parents cut my wrist to get the insurance payout. What's wrong with doing the same thing? Seriously... What's wrong with it? Suck on my breasts! You suck! Welcome home, Megumi. We can see each other like usual again, right? Have a good night. Have a good night. Have a good night. Come out for once. Yes, that's fine. We're thinking of going bowling. Bowling? Your injury is healed now, right? Well, yeah, the injury is... Here it comes! Here it comes! Wonderful! Okay, my turn!
