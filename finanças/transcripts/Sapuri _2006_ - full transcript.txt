I quit I thought he was kind of interesting well he's not really on top of everything people would say but that doesn't mean he isn't good for this workforce that's why I accepted him we need someone who says something interesting I don't think that interesting is what is important what's important is how much passion you have for work don't be so tight, and just have a drink I'll be leaving first I still have work 1/3 disappears in a year? in the creative competition is tough especially at the headquarters So Fujii-san is working hard you know her?

Welcome Insurance, Family Money.. is there another way should we do more hearing oh the next presentation I hear the head is coming from America why don't we take that into consideration but we are very domestic in Japan thanks wait you isn't your mother working in the insurance does she have like a saying for when she convinces her customers to join? even if you say that suddenly no use asking a part-timer yes? oh~ nice talking to you you sound great a woman? yes it is it's a woman? no question when someone tells you to do it you don't want to study and in the same way in the same way when you say join, join you don't want to that's insurance that's what my mom said I understand I will be seeing you join after you're sick join after you get hurt join after you die, like stuff like that like when you say stuff like that she said that people actually listen I think join insurance after you die... you can't join that's what you use well it's a good start I won't specify a style a joke, story, documentary anything is good next will be in 3 days gather all the members and come here you think of something too me me? Basic knowledge about maing a commercial I didn't think you were here it's very surprising nothing really I had extra time and I was bored so I was looking for comics and... buck teeth "Gachapin" (gacahapin is a Japanese characters with buck teeth and huge eyes) my old nickname? buck teeth "Gachapin" shh sorry I used to have really badly lined teeth and I always had braces on and my eyes were big and I was a hard working student and people started calling me that and I was really lost and then I saw that CM the one where the dog is simply walking around in the rain I felt like I was seeing myself and I felt better and I thought that, that was amazing that's why I joined this workforce it was the right choice I met a lot of people/things I hope you have good meetings too I'm counting on you Ishida ok Gachapin Where's Fujii-san? yes?

I can't give that much of a hint he really doesn't have an idea let's try thinking of another slogan Fujii-san? there's trouble with Jewelry Company subs:dancestar24 memo? you received the message? the client got mad when the project was handed in the order to change the set plan hadn't happened and from there, there just came more and more complaints the situation got worse and Fujii-san is being blamed for Please do I'm sorry uh... uh... it's fine don't worry hello? this is Fujii I'm sorry I'm sorry it's my mistake for not making sure I will work on it now and then join here later I'm really sorry sorry sorry I can't go today It's fine I'll wait To the designer I'll ask if changing this a little will be a good enough [I don't know what time it will be] [I want to see you, there's something I want to say] sorry I can't Nice work I'll wait as long as it takes Most horoscopes are divided into love and work luck I'm sorry, we are closed for today that's because the two are linked I wanted to give this to you, seeing you but it's impossible now sorry sorry this is all I can make no thanks he's not coming he's in a shallow place my mom often said that he's only in shallow places always saying Enjoy Enjoy he just goes after what he likes I think it's a perfect time Creative Director: imaoka kiyotaro why don't you have another face than that another face? just a father Natsuki I'm borrowing this you come too where are you going? Imaoka-san what do you want in the middle of the night we were drinking it was just getting good ok we're gonna make the presentation now from now? Walker Insurance in the sophisticated western writing add the simple, direct, familiar Japanese culture I was told to help you no need but I'm fine I can do this myself uh... this morning uh.. this morning it was a lie that I was in a hospital actually I was playing at the beach hanging out with my friends No worry, I'm fine But, you're mad I'm fine but I'm telling I'm fine I don't want to make things worse I have work to do so, go I can do this myself what's that? ignoring me? just erasing other people what is fine? what is I can do this myself? not like that but uh.. like if you want to say something why don't you just you don't like it you don't like work you... just like being by yourself Ishida make copies for everyone Ishida! quickly like appearing on a white sketchbook and disappearaing like even a kid can understand hey how's this? listen? Imaoka-san too come on it's really good see? you must be tired would you like any coffee, rice balls, sandwiches, etc. there's a lot of stuff here copy again? how is it please go first I'll deliver it later let's go yes thank you everyone I'll be going It gets me tired watching her holding on to the company's name looking like I'm really working hard work doesn't save a woman a woman with just work is worse than a man, those poor people doesn't she realize, she's seen that way? it's true that now it's like that but if you do good work you can meet a good guy it becomes a sapuri (sapuri=supplement) sapuri? a nutrient for being a good woman don't you think that, that's a thrill in a woman's life this time what we would like to present is kanji (japanese characters) kanji? - yes [person] person what person needs to do before they die [death] [death] that would be to look back on your life (the characters stand and look are used) [parents] a person eventually becomes a parent (all of the small characters together create the character for parent) what can you do then? [what can you leave] it's receiving good ratings they want to go in this direction I was told that we will get an answer soon told you yes Nice to see you oh... Create Agency was involved too? Konishiki? hello this way please we lost yes we lost we lost to Konishiki Konishiki? the sumo wrestler? according to what I heard in the contents, our plan was superior but when there's a celebrity Konishiki... Americans want well that's better well i mean all we are doing is drawing on a canvas in the desert when the wind blows that's it let's enjoy our loss but we were offered to compete in the next CM of their company another one? I'm passing, I have other work I will do it please let me thanks I can't believe you do this like a job that you don't even know will happen useless job why do you do it? I mean no matter how much you work the salary is the same I mean isn't work just money as long as you make money it's better that it's easy and fun go have fun at the beach have fun with friends isn't that what everyone does but why why do you work that hard? why? when I realized I was here really? yes I see that's all I could say at first when I first started, and I was your age in any meeting I couldn't say what I wanted to what the old men said I just agreed really? yes I agree really? yes I agree but one day, one person accepted me a project I drew it's not that good but there's passion passion? I wanted to answer to that and when I realized I was a planner the first CM I did I met him together forever (the slogan of the commercial) he told me that, he'll definitely give it to me when I become a real worker doing realy well I'll give you a box (of the product from the CM) instead of a ring together forever so... then with him what happened? it's an old story but it's really strong only 15 seconds is a memory forever if it wasn't for this job I wouldn't have realized how important each second is if you really make use of it, how much it can shine I feel really happy if I can live through such seconds I think that I can be happy from now on too so what are you doing? Aikido I'm taking lessons using the other's strength, you throw it back isn't that similar to this job? no like this go ahead we broke up why? finally we're not long distance A happy one second if something like that really existed honestly, I didn't really understand then but at this moment this one second one second five seconds 15 seconds just a little longer I wished it could last a little longer subs: dancestar24
