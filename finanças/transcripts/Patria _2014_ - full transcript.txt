NEAR PARIS, 1914 Yes, over here! Me? Didn't you see? He tackled me. Didn't you see, you idiot? Arthur! Arthur, come here. -What is it? -I thought he was your friend. Yes, but now he is the referee and he's a bad one. Give me a kiss. -How did the interview go yesterday? -I didn't go. Come on, Arthur. Jobs aren't easy to find these days. -I can't vouch for you this way. -I'll go and see him tomorrow. Really, Tinus. I'll do it tomorrow. -Tonight, Boulevard du Temple? -Great idea. I'm going to see my father first, if you don't mind. I'll pass. I'll see you tonight at the Boulevard. DUTCH SOCIAL CLUB Dear friends, I'm not the only critic in Paris anymore. Mr. van der Wal bestowed on me the honour of writing an article about me. But if you consult the papers you'll find an article that's a complete dog's breakfast. Obviously, I'm uninformed, I have no talent, and I'm too modern. I wouldn't want to keep this article from you. But I take him scoffing at me in the end as a big compliment. I… Ah. My son. I recently learned that he's seeing a young lady. And for that he seeks his father's advice. Where is Martinus? I saw his opera. It was awful. I think I won't be back for a long time. In Holland the papers have a culture section as well. And the Huns are at our doorstep. Your brother and sister, Kees and Renée, haven't seen Mies for months. You could come. You could write about the war. It might not be culture and I don't think the Huns appreciate it as much as Sarah Bernhardt. But still… Come and see me before I leave tomorrow, if you're not too hung-over. That Sophie of yours… -When you are really serious… -I am. I know what you're getting at. It's wonderful to be married, you know. Marriage binds… With the chains of freedom. -Stop it. When did you see Mom last? -I'm going to see her next. The door's always open for you, you know that. -Don't forget that. -Don't worry. I always take good care of myself. And if you leave your books, Zola and Couperus can keep me company. Willem Kloos is also in town. Arthur. -The war broke out. -What? The war broke out. -What about your dad? -He doesn't like it. Me neither. Maybe it's not even possible. Of course it is. Kees, Jacques, Leon and Jan have all enlisted. Yes, but they have a French passport. They're French. They don't eat snails, but still. I love you very much, Arthur. I love you too. -Sophie… -Yes? It's not just because of the others, you know. It is also because… It's serious, you know? The Huns will come and they aren't kidding around. Do you know what they did in Belgium? They slaughtered entire villages. Men and women. I'd never forgive myself. But Arthur, if that's what you think… I mean… Sophie, when I get back from expelling the Huns from our beloved France, you and I will marry. Dear Dad, I understand your concerns, but you must agree that the barbaric German invasion cannot remain without repercussions. Our dear country is being threatened. I cannot idly watch how others fight for what is my ideal as well. Should the war take a favourable turn before Christmas, my involvement won't make a difference. But I fear-- Dear son, you are as fierce as your little brother. I know blood is thicker than water. But you can't blame me for worrying. You're such an intelligent young man. I can't bear the thought of losing my own blood. You mentioned Christmas. And yes, it would be nice if the war-- Dear parents, I hope you are all well. I decided to enlist for the big adventure. The Foreign Legion has opened office here. I will enlist tomorrow. I'll write soon about my progress. Please don't worry about me. Love, Arthur. Papers? - Name? - Niels Brentjens. - Nationality? - Dutch. Papers? - Name? - Niek Goren. Papers? - Name? - Sjef de Koning. - Nationality? - Belgian. - Under what name will you enlist? - Pierre la Roux. He must have done something bad. Papers? - Name? - Arthur Knaap. - Nationality? - Dutch. It pleases me to know, Mr. Knaap, there are still Dutchmen without fear. You will be part of the 3rd battalion. 3rd regiment. Wear your wooden shoes. We've got more of you over there. Thanks. Papers? - Name? - Martinus Kriens. - Nationality? - Dutch. Voulez-vous prómenez avec moi? Nee. Voulez-vous promenez avec moi. Voulez-vous promenez avec moi. It's alright, Tinus. I will take that walk with you. - I must say, we're very well trained. - You think so? We trained in marching for four weeks, and look, we're marching. Listen, normally they won't send you to battle until after twelve weeks. There can only be two reasons why they send us already after four. De Rooy. - Which two reasons? - Either we are very good soldiers… …or we don't need to be good soldiers. The only reason you'll open your mouth is to put another piece of tobacco in it. - Understood? - Understood, lieutenant. - What are you going to do after the war? - I'm going to work with my father. Maybe we'll write a play. In any case, we'll fill the culture section in the paper. As long as you write good reviews about my work, I'm fine with anything. First time? Jean-Paul, the Legion has arrived. Where were you stationed? North Africa? Indochina? - Paris. - Paris? La Légion. Arthur… Look through this. See that barn? At first light, you follow the ditch and then you'll get there. You'll be replacing Pierre. Keep your eyes open and shoot anything that moves. March. Pierre. And everyone thought we'd be home by Christmas. I don't know, Tinus. It's nothing like we expected. I couldn't tell you what I imagined it to be like. Probably galloping, following the flags, swords drawn. Me too. Chin up. We may not be home by Christmas, but surely by Easter. Arthur, our replacements arrived. Are you coming to replace-- The old mill, quick! The old mill! We'll call it a day, men. Let's get a few hours of rest. - Martinus was your friend, wasn't he? - Yes. Someday you'll be able to visit his grave and remember what happened. But not today, Arthur. Not today. - How's your family doing? - They're doing well. But my dad is ill and there's no money. He works too much. And when he works, he gets worked up. - Where does he live? - They sent him to Zandvoort. The sea air is good for him. I guess it'll be fine. - Do you long for home? I mean Holland. - Holland? I can get a clean room and a nice broad in France too. A better one, even. But my mother lives over there. My clients are French, my girlfriends are French. I wouldn't want anyone telling me off because I'm working on a Sunday. - How about you? - My dad and I are very close. I miss the rice dishes. You've never tasted anything like it. If we ever get out of this, my sister will cook rice dishes for us. Piss off. I'm going mataglap here. Dear parents, brothers and sisters. I'm still in good health. Hopefully that goes for you too. Don't worry about me. Everything is going to be just fine. You are all well, except for Dad. He worked too much, but hopefully the sea air will make him feel better. I read that Dad is worried about me. There really is no reason for that. Miraculously, I'm in great health. I haven't suffered any injuries or slight illnesses. Please write soon. Arthur. Hey chink, the lieutenant needs all the letter writing paper himself. - Lieutenant. - Yes. I'd like to go to Holland on furlough. To Holland? In theory, that's possible. You're allowed to have 14 days. You'll need to travel, pay a short visit and be back on time. - I know. - And be back on time. - Will you ask permission? - I can't promise you anything. We're in an instable political situation. Today they grant you furlough, tomorrow they'll shoot you for it. But I'll ask. - Why do you want to go to Holland? - Dad is ill. And to get chocolate and tobacco. - Do you know Van Maaswijk? - From the bakery. He was executed. He wanted to desert, together with a friend. Make sure you're back on time or they'll start without you. Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto. Right… The casualty lists. A shame. But well… I'm sure you know all about it. How are the men? I think they need a good attack. That's good for the morale of the troops. Proper clothing would also help a lot. Perhaps you can put in a good word at the depot. And then there's the request of… Knaap? Wasn't it? - Arthur Knaap. - Yes. I don't grant furlough to Holland often. There's always the chance that they… Don't get me wrong, Theo. I don't mean to disrespect your men. I understand. More than once they don't come back. - His father… Otto Knaap, isn't it? - Yes. - I understand he's a well-known writer? - A culture critic. - At which paper? -The Telegraph. He used to write about the theatre in Paris. About Martinus Kriens' operas. - You are aware he was killed near Frise? - I am. About Arthur Knaap's father… It would be nice if he could write a positive article on our contribution to the war. It's about time the people know what we do here. Then they might get off of their lazy neutral asses. Is it good? This one's so good. Do you know where it comes from? Where Van Maaswijk worked. - They brought them. - Right before he… - Smell this. - Oh… - Nice, or what? - Really good. - Want to share it? - We could do that. - But that crust looks thin-- - It is thin. No, that crust is bread squashed together. The inside is just air. - Then you take the crust. - No, I already ate. I'm doing you a favour, don't you see? Gentlemen, this is Jules. He's a Belgian addition to our battalion. I'm Flemish. This is Sjarrel. He'll show you your quarters. And De Rooy will make sure you get food. Gentlemen… Yes, I'm dividing the food here. What have you got with you? I don't mind sharing, but that chocolate is very special. Maybe we could trade it for your watch? Excuse me? Arthur, this one's a real clown. Neat trick. Maybe you can steal a machine gun from the other side. We're a few short. Let them eat. I'll show you around. Can't sleep? Here it's nothing like home. Van 't Hart is a good lieutenant. It could be much worse. - Arthur… - Yes? Do you think a bomb could fall through our roof? I don't think so, it's quite sturdy. Don't think about those things too much. Think about home, or something. My home is gone, did you know? My parents were visiting the neighbours while my sister was in her crib in the bedroom. A grenade went straight through our roof. We couldn't find my sister anymore. Sometimes I think she flew straight to heaven. Here. It doesn't smell like soldier. It always helps me. Don't do anything funny. That's my girlfriend you're smelling. If he gets to smell your girlfriend, I want it too. - Shut up and go to sleep, De Rooy. -Oui, Lieutenant. Jules. Dear Mom and Dad, we have a Belgian guy here, who's kind of a street vendor. I don't know what he really is, but he's got a talent of making us laugh till we drop. In the most tragic moments, he finds the right word to cheer us up. Sometimes I comfort him. He's still young and inexperienced. He never gets mail and is very lonely. I got your letters yesterday and I read them twice. I even cried a little last night. It's horrible to know your father's ill and your mother worries. It's worse knowing they worry about money than to see the destruction and dying comrades around you. And in times of melancholy I think of the times ahead of us, of peace and brotherhood. Don't forget that this taught your son how to love you with all his heart. Love, Arthur. De Rooy. Hand them out. We don't have much time. Arthur, mail for you. You're going to Holland. They're coming. Man the firing lines. Wait. Wait. Fire. Hold the right ﬂank. François… The lieutenant got hit. Lieutenant. Stretcher. Stretcher. What does it say? Are the Germans apologizing and sending us their pay? No, we're getting new uniforms. And nobody will be granted furlough to Holland. Go away. Piss off. Dear Dad, it pains me that I'm so far from home while I know you need my help. I'm ashamed leading this easy life, because whoever is still alive, is assured of a meal the next day. I don't know what I could say to cheer you up, because all words have no use. But know that my thoughts are very often with you. I believe the war will be over soon and we'll be reunited. I'll see you soon, Arthur. Sjarrel. What does it say? His father died. Arthur… I'm happy you came to me first. Why don't you write more often? Because I can't lie to you. I know things are different there. I read the newspapers. You live in trenches, the conditions are harsh. And you've got nothing to do all day. I'm not surprised the Huns are still there. It must be terrible for you. But it's almost over, isn't it? - Do they write that? - Yes, and also that the soup is horrible. If we get any. For France, old man. For France. What have you done for France, huh? What have you done for France? Thrust. Parry. Thrust. Parry. - Grenade. - Place. Dead. Grenade. Yes. Dead. Grenade. - Dead. - Dead? - Hey, Knaap. Knock it off. - You're dead. Knaap. Knaap, come here. What the hell was that? I got carried away. It won't happen again. Save it for the Huns. Again. Lieutenant, if you give me your revolver, I will go and have a look. - With too many people, it goes wrong. - You're my responsibility. We go over the top tomorrow. That's already bad enough. I understand, but I've done this before. You'll take two men with you. Arthur. Jules. - Jules is not coming. - That's not your call. I don't want to have to babysit him all the time. What's your problem with him? What do we do? Make some noise. Fix bayonets. For France. GERMAN LINES Yes? Understood. Make way. Jawara. Go ahead. No fear. No mercy. For France. Hold the line. We're the second wave. For France. Knaap. Arthur. Arthur. Jules. - Where is Jules? - Where is Jules? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the gas will be released tomorrow. Here and here. Yes, that's what I heard them saying. Will you intervene immediately? No, we have to wait until the gas is in the trenches. We need to make sure it's effective before we attack. Right, I understand. Very brave of you to give me this information. It would be better if your colleagues did the same. Of all this shit, gas is the worst. The first battalion is stuck in North Belloy. We're here, in South Belloy. The German artillery is here, here and here. It seems as if this whole ﬂank is open. Is that possible? -Do we have a phone line? -No. -Is there a messenger? -No, it's one big mess. We all feel we need to attack again with the three battalions. I don't want to hear that nonsense. I don't care about that. Those pompous men in their posh offices. We'll lose all our men. Lieutenant, I would like to volunteer for patrol. -Who says we're sending one? -The first battalion is in trouble. -It's a mess. -I would like to go. No. I already lost two messengers today. We could postpone your death a little longer. Gentlemen, you're doing a lot of talking, but talking doesn't get us anywhere. This brave young man wants to join his comrades in battle. Voluntarily. Isn't this the exemplary behaviour we're looking for? It would be outrageous not to send your men into battle. I know you're tired and you need rest. But we're at the front and the Huns are on their last legs. If it were up to me, we wouldn't be here but in the centre of Belloy. Another reason to grant the request of this brave young man. I heard the Germans will carry out a gas attack tomorrow at 8.15 a.m. Use that information wisely. Let this young man and his comrades go. Maybe they'll find the rest and capture the village. Alright. -Hello? -Shut up. Do you want to die or something? Hello? Who are you? I'm Jules. Jules, do you know where you are? No, I don't. What is your name? I'm Pablo Aguilar. I'm Spanish. And you? I'm Flemish. I'm with a Dutch battalion. My eyes are hurt. I can't see. Do you think it's permanent? If you don't shut up it will be! -I'm going to die. -Me too. -What's the situation? -We're doing okay, but over there they're kicking our asses. -I think there's more. -More what? -More like Jules. -It's a miracle if he's still alive. -Blow the horn. Come on! -What? -Pablo. They're here. -This way, comrades. Pablo. -What's happening? -I see Jules. -He's walking towards that machine gun. -What? Damnit! The left side of the bunker. -Grenade. -I'm out. Damnit. Sjarrel, get that riﬂe and get into position. EIGHT YEARS LATER There's nothing I can do. He breathed in too much gas. It's common, symptoms getting worse after so many years. -I wish you much courage. -Thank you. It's bad news, I'm afraid. He's upstairs. Don't wait too long. Gradually attempts were made to force the world to believe that this state had a special political and military mission to fulfil. He likes listening to the radio, especially jazz music. A soldier, like eight or ten million others. November 1918 seemed to me to repeat what Germany 60 years earlier already had experienced. Something had become clear to me in those November days: If the life, the origin of the individual people, the economy, class, occupation, education, knowledge, wealth separates them, then politics cannot build on this separation and organize it politically and thus perpetuate it.
