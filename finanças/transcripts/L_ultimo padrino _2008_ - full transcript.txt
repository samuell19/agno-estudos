Many are the trials ﻿we are subjected to. ﻿The best solution ﻿is not always the easiest. ﻿But tell him he should turn a blind eye. ﻿before we close both of his. ﻿What’s he doing? ﻿That's where he hides the notes! ﻿- It's time. - Great! ﻿- Fly. Giant. - I’ll fly. ﻿Pull it up! ﻿- Can I make a call? - Dial 0 first. ﻿live done everything you said. I photographed it and put it back. ﻿There’s a girl carrying a blue bag on her way out. ﻿The note says they're taking someone to see Uncle this evening. ﻿It seems Uncle is expecting visitors. ﻿We have to find out who’s passing the information on to him. ﻿That's where the exchange takes place. ﻿-	She's left the bag there. -	She's passed the note on. ﻿- To that guy? What do you think? - It’s possible. ﻿Let’s follow him. ﻿- Alfiere. Africa, you go after him. - Message received, boss. ﻿The guys inside are starting to get edgy. ﻿WhaUwith the tough jail regime and no sign of their retrials yet. ﻿Do the,^ think we don't give a damn? ﻿We see to all their needs, and their families. ﻿We promised them they'd start to release them after ten years. ﻿- But nothing’s happened. - The 10 years aren't up yet! ﻿- So what? - With your permission ﻿would like to say something too. ﻿Shuteye, you're right. ﻿I promised I’d have things sorted out in ten years, but instead ﻿it’s taking longer. What do we do? Start with the bombs again? ﻿Have we achieved anything with this truce with the state? ﻿This truce has enabled us to get back on our feet. ﻿We’ve started to grow again, without being noticed. ﻿If we start fighting the state again, they'll tear us to pieces again. ﻿The day our wonderful organization becomes invisible ﻿and ceases to scare them. ﻿then we will have the retrials ﻿and the end of the tough prison regime. ﻿But we still have a long hard road to undertake, like that of Moses. ﻿Our Promised Land gets closer every day. ﻿And I will take you there. ﻿Look in your pockets and tell me ﻿whether you have more money now. or 10. 20 years ago. ﻿War costs, and peace profits. ﻿Explain that ﻿to those who complain, to those in jail. ﻿to those in need. ﻿Tell them that Uncle always keeps his promises. ﻿God bless you. ﻿Slow down, don't get too close. ﻿We were right. He's been driving around for three hours. ﻿- Right. Don’t lose - Don't worry. ﻿Get a move on. Giant! Let's get closer to him. ﻿Be careful. ﻿Don't get worked up. Uncle. ﻿It's for tonight. ﻿o one must know about it. No one. ﻿He’s pulling over. ﻿He's stopped the car. ﻿There's a distinguished-looking man with a bag getting into his car. ﻿He's taken his glasses off. he’s passing him something. ﻿Africa, get closer. I can't see. ﻿- What’s he doing? - Putting something over his face. ﻿A blindfold. So he won't know where he's taking him. ﻿He's the man Uncle's waiting for. ﻿I'll alert the others. ﻿This is it. boys. Keep your distance. ﻿This way. doctor. ﻿- Is everything okay? - No hitches. ﻿Excuse me. doctor. ﻿Go inside. ﻿We're all ready, sir. ﻿What are we waiting for? He's only 150 mts away, boss! ﻿Let's go and get him. ﻿- Freeze! - I’m unarmed! ﻿Stay where you are! Didn't you hear us. you shit? ﻿No! No! Don't shoot! ﻿It's got nothing to do with me! ﻿- Fiore! - There's no one here. ﻿- No luck! - He's not here! ﻿- Tell me where he is! Where is he? - Who are you talking about? ﻿• Get your hands up! - On your knees. ﻿Look in the hen-coop! ﻿- I don't believe it. - Too good to be true. ﻿The doctor came here to see Uncle. He should have been here. ﻿Perhaps he's still in the area, he may be nearby. ﻿Send me all the men you can. we’ll comb the area. ﻿It's me. ﻿Yes. Sanna wants reinforcements. All you have, the helicopter too. ﻿Mister Prosecutor. ﻿They come for you at night, blindfold you. and you think that's normal? ﻿- Calm down. Roberto! - I won’t fucking calm down! ﻿Get him out of here. ﻿- He knew who the patient was. - That's possible. ﻿It's possible. ﻿But he’ll never tell you. so calm down. ﻿I'm innocent! I’m innocent! ﻿Innocent! They're all innocent here! ﻿Take him away. Take him away, come on. ﻿The innocent man was carrying these notes addressed to Uncle. ﻿- What are these? - It's a drug for the prostate. ﻿There are six boxes of it. ﻿Good day. Uncle. What's up? ﻿-Something went wrong. - Something, or somebody? ﻿Someone who wanted to take Benedetto Faro's place. ﻿and not only that. ﻿Is there any proof? ﻿No proof, just beliefs. ﻿I know it was Shuteye and the Schisa brothers, that's what I believe. ﻿And if you give me permission. I'll take care of it for you. ﻿There's a time for everything. ﻿I need to see a doctor. ﻿Leave it to me. We can get hold of the best doctors. ﻿It’s not that easy. it's more complicated than that. ﻿The cops were there waiting for me. ﻿They know now. ﻿These are all doctors involved in or suspected of Mafia activities. ﻿There are important names there, even urologists, like the one with Faro. ﻿We have to check them all out. particularly the urologists. ﻿We need reinforcements. ﻿Know why the man we are looking for has been at large for 40 years? ﻿Have you ever wondered why he's the only one of the old guard ﻿to have survived the Mafia wars and the arrests ﻿that followed the murders of judges Falcone and Borsellino? ﻿Or why he's the only one no Mafia turncoat has ever talked about. ﻿and who has left behind a trail of murders yet no trace? ﻿Because he’s more intelligent, more wily and more cautious. ﻿He’s the only man we only have one photo of. and that's an old one. ﻿We don't even know what he looks like. ﻿If we treat him like any other fugitive, we'll never catch him. ﻿So you're telling us not to check out the doctors? ﻿We’ll do that too. we can’t leave any stone unturned. ﻿but I think I’ve worked out how he thinks. ﻿He won’t approach any doctor connected with the Mafia. ﻿He’ll look for someone who's clean, like that doctor with Faro. ﻿He might even refuse to see a specialist ﻿because he knows we can check them out much easier. ﻿He needs these. Letts c-hec-k the chemists as well as the doctors. ﻿and record all the names of those who buy these drugs, especially in bulk. ﻿Anything else? ﻿Yes. We'll check the sales and rescriptions of the last few months. ﻿Good hunting. ﻿Well, doctor? ﻿- Look. Mr... - Caruano. ﻿Mr Caruano. ﻿I don’t feel I can make a diagnosis. ﻿The only thing I can tell you is you’ll need further tests... ﻿and rather urgently too. ﻿Jjfapu need a’specialist. - Why’s that? ﻿- You need a specialist. - Why’s that? ﻿Because this isn't my ﻿I treat more trivial diseases. ﻿Is it that serious? ﻿Mr Caruano. it's not very professional of me. ﻿But you’re a doctor. You know. ﻿You have a tumour. ﻿A tumour? ﻿Cancer. ﻿How long have I got? ﻿couldn’t tell you that. ﻿I don’t know this kind of carcinoma. I don’t know how aggressive it is. ﻿I don't know whether it’s operable, or curable, if there's any treatment. ﻿The only thing I can do is give you the name of the specialist structures ﻿and the names of two specialists, two brilliant surgeons. ﻿• You're as sweet as sugar. Really. - Thanks. ﻿You know I'm happy to help. See you Sunday. Annetta. ﻿- Yes. see you Sunday. Bye. - No luck. As always. ﻿-Were you hoping she'd say something? -No. but... ﻿How did she sound? ﻿ormal. same as usua ﻿Either she doesn't know her husband's ill. or she thinks it’s not serious. ﻿- Keep listening in. - Sure. ﻿I listen, look, follow. Other people's lives are my speciality. ﻿- What do you mean? - Nothing. ﻿- Shall we talk about your life then? - No. I know even less about that. ﻿Roberto. ﻿Yes. ﻿can talk about your life. ﻿I know you well. And I know what you need in order to be happy. ﻿- It’s under your nose. - Go away! Get back to work! ﻿- I have a list of suspect chemists. - Have you found anything? ﻿There are two chemists in Ciminna. ﻿Altieri, don't keep me waiting all day. ﻿Yesterday two different people went to buy ﻿three boxes of this drug. ﻿Ciminna is thirty kilometres from where we arrested Faro. ﻿- Well done. - Do you know who they are? ﻿We have their names, we’re checking them out. ﻿Good. ﻿Hurry up. ﻿Hurry up! ﻿I don't need these any more. ﻿What did he say? ﻿I took the results of the scan you had done to a specialist in Palermo. ﻿He said it's serious. ﻿->How serious? I	\ - It's very widespread. ﻿• How serious? - It's very widespread. ﻿Uncle, you need to undergo an urgent operation. ﻿- Yes. but we’ll have to go abroad. - Where to? ﻿Abroad, the cops are watching all the hospitals here. ﻿Somewhere far away, you take care of it. ﻿It’ll take some time to find the right contacts. ﻿Time? Do you know how much time I have left? I don’t. ﻿Only Our Lord knows that. ﻿But I have faith, you know, a great deal of faith. ﻿Ciccio. no one must find out about this. No one. ﻿No one will. ﻿But to make sure no one suspects, we’ll have act quickly. ﻿Now the cops have arrested Faro the mice are playing. ﻿- What mice? - The Schisa brothers. ﻿They've contacted Shuteye. He's convinced he can branch out. ﻿And you know when people branch out ﻿some people get tempted to take it all. ﻿If you give me your blessing.. ﻿Only the Pope can give his blessing... ﻿- I want to see my wife. - I'll arrange it. ﻿Your servant. Uncle. ﻿Don’t forget. t ﻿Good man. ﻿Don Peppe. ﻿Good morning. ﻿-	Good morning. -	Good morning. ﻿- Good morning. Don Peppino. - Good morning. Everything okay? ﻿- Good day. Don Peppino. - Good morning. ﻿-	The usual? -	The usual. ﻿Where are you going, you son of a bitch? ﻿Where are you going? ﻿"The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light ﻿and the stars will fall from Heaven. ﻿Watch therefore. ﻿for ye know hot what hour your Lord doth come." ﻿Let me through. ﻿Let me through. ﻿Peppino Schisa. a businessman. Connected to Benedetto Faro. ﻿Peppino Schisa. a businessman. Connected to Benedetto Faro. ﻿-His brother Salvatore was killed on the road to Palermo shortly after. ﻿It’s a settling of accounts, they want Uncle's protection. ﻿They're after Faro's place. ﻿And someone’s probably already won. ﻿The men who bought the medicines in Ciminna appear to be clean. ﻿- What do you'mean, "appear"? 2 shepherds with prostate problems. ﻿- They had prescriptions. - Who are they? ﻿Who are their relatives, their friends? We need to know everything. ﻿Whoever carried out these crimes is probably Uncle's right-hand man! ﻿"They appear". ﻿It’s easy to kill. ﻿A man. an animal. it makes no difference. ﻿And after your first killing, it gets easier and easier. ﻿The Schisa brothers were traitors. ﻿They;d been conspiring with Shuteye for some time, and he's the worst. ﻿But I want to talk to Shuteye. ﻿With all due respect. I think Shuteye is taking advantage of you. ﻿That’s why I want to talk to him. ﻿Why are you doing this to me? ﻿The Schisa brothers were connected to Faro. ﻿Now he’s in jail they wanted to get on someone else's side. ﻿They "were looking for another point of reference ﻿in order to carry on their trafficking alone. ﻿Oh. hell.. ﻿According to rumours ﻿they had gone over to Shuteye’s side. ﻿Someone who wants to make his way up. but that's all I know. ﻿What if I ask you about a sick old man? ﻿- Very sick. - Look after yourself, mister cop. ﻿They’ve spotted us. They left some flowers on the car. ﻿Let’s get out of here. ﻿Uncle knows it’s not worth his while to kill cops. ﻿• Since when? - The last few years. ﻿- Chrysanthemums are for the dead. - Precisely, we're alive. ﻿Take it easy. ﻿We're just normal cops investigating a murder, okay? ﻿Bloody hell! ﻿-	Good morning. -	Good morning. ﻿- Where is she? - In there. She's been waiting hours. ﻿Are you crying? You haven’t seen me in a long time. ﻿You've lost weight. Are you tired? ﻿Come in here. ﻿Sit down. ﻿How are you? ﻿What is it. darling? ﻿I'm happy, happy to see you again. ﻿Nothing troubles me as long as you're all right. ﻿- I want you to tell me. - I'm fine. ﻿'m fine. I’m fine. ﻿How are the kids? ﻿Fine, they're fine. ﻿Did I ever tell you you did a good job of bringing them up? ﻿You've been good to me too. ﻿And in exchange I have given you a hard life. ﻿- Why are you talking like this? - Like what? ﻿As though this was a farewell. ﻿I've only just got here, and you want me to go already? ﻿You’re not well, my darling. Tell me what's wrong. ﻿—Nothing, it's nothing. I've walked for miles, that's all. ﻿Tell me the truth. Tell me! ﻿Uncle wants an answer straight away. ﻿■ What do we tell him? - Can we refuse Uncle? ﻿Then tell him yes. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Nino Morra. known as Shuteye because of an old scar from 30 years ago. ﻿Fugitive for the last 7. Area boss of Alcamo. ﻿another farmhand, another of the old man’s tight circle. ﻿- Is he behind these murders? - No. ﻿He wanted to be his right-hand man. but someone's stopping him. ﻿They killed the other two to weaken him. ﻿I can confirm that. ’ve got the code for Faro's notes. ﻿They’re numbers in place of letters. ﻿"A" corresponds to 4. "B" to 5. It's a coarse method, but a fiddly one. ﻿The real problem is their grammar. They consider it an optional. ﻿Shuteye isn’t in a good position, he's branched out too far. ﻿He had one of his cronies elected area boss in Agrigento. ﻿saying he had Uncle's go-ahead, but it wasn't true. ﻿- So he’s in trouble? - Yes. ﻿- He might talk if we find him. - If we find him. ﻿- Alive. - Let's start looking. ﻿Th is is Nino Morra. Come and get me. I'm at the Tropical Bar. ﻿• Nicola, give me a prosecco. - Coming up. ﻿Iced. ﻿- Nino Morra. Carabinieri! - Let me pay for my drink first! ﻿- Come with us! - Easy! ﻿They got there before us. Someone wanted Shuteye out of the way. ﻿He'd worked it out. he let them catch him. ﻿-	I think he'll talk. -	He already has. ﻿The evening you arrested Faro. Uncl was 100 metres from the farmhouse ﻿The evening you arrested Faro. Uncle was 100 metres from the farmhouse. ﻿- The doctor was there to see him. - It's in the Carabinieri's hands now. ﻿It would've been better not to know. ﻿- Does he know where’s he hiding? - No. ﻿■ Does he know where’s he hiding? - No. ﻿- Uncle is on his guard now. - They’ll never catch him. ﻿The last contact Shuteye had was through the shepherds from Ciminna. ﻿-	Ciminna? -	Yes. Why? ﻿We caught two guys from Giminna after investigating the medicine lead. ﻿Here, eat up.,you're thin. But if it's them, the inquiry stays with us. ﻿Shuteye’s wife has disappeared. ﻿They came for her at night. Her brother and cousin have vanished too. ﻿And-we've not heard fr or seen him since. ﻿Shuteye’s sold himself out to the cops. ﻿That's why I found you another hideout. ﻿I didn't trust Shuteye. ﻿Now we liaverfo keep an eye on Shuteye's buddies ﻿and be very careful. ﻿Remind everyone not to talk, especially in enclosed places. ﻿hotels, restaurants, cars, homes. It's better if they keep quiet. ﻿Anyone who receives information ﻿must know only who brings it. and who he has to pass it on to. ﻿He mustn’t know who had it before, or who’ll have it next. ﻿Then if someone sings, they only know their own song. ﻿- • Haye you found - Yes. contact? I ﻿- -The.yire the best specialists in Europe and the contact is reliable. ﻿But I need time Mt to get it organized. ﻿I trust you. Don't make any mistakes. ﻿Uncle, making a mistake is like betraying, and I won't betray you. ﻿But we have another problem. ﻿The Runaways have decided to come back. ﻿Someone's waiting for them, they say they can't change ﻿the decisions taken by the commission twenty years ago. ﻿Living in America or dying in Sicily. ﻿Times were different then, there was a war on. and we won it. ﻿Things have changed, we have to reason with those boys. ﻿Maybe you should explain it to us. Some in Palermo don't want to reason. ﻿- Who doesn't want to reason? - Several people. Mainly the Lopanes. ﻿They said the decision was taken twenty years ago ﻿and you can't go back on decisions, that promises aren’t enough. ﻿I have always kept my promises. ﻿But now I need a bit a peace. I need... ﻿Another war would be the ruin of us all. ﻿Arrange a meeting with the Lopanes. ﻿I want to talk to them. ﻿Morra. you told us about two shepherds from Ciminna. ﻿They delivered Uncle’s note to you. Is that right? ﻿Yes. That's all I know about the boys who are taking care of Uncle. ﻿- These men? - Yes. ﻿How did you do that? This is them. ﻿We want to know everything about him. everything you know. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿The way he talks. the way he moves, dresses and eats. ﻿the way he shakes your hand, or looks at you. ﻿I don't understand. If I tell you how he eats will that help you catch him? ﻿-I want to know who we’re up against. -What can I tell you? ﻿- Everything you know about him. - Everything I know about him... ﻿I noticed his hands most of all. They’re large and white. ﻿He likes honey. but it has to be a certain kind. ﻿He likes music, he likes Claudio Villa. Mina, he loves Mina. ﻿He likes the sound track from "The Godfather". ﻿When the film came out a few years ago. ﻿he had someone take him to the cinema five times, to see the same film. ﻿And everyone knows Uncle is very religious, he's a believer. ﻿He’s always got the Bible open. He reads it. writes in it. ﻿and he wears three crucifixes around his neck. ﻿He kisses them, touches them. That's what he's like. ﻿That's what he's like, he says everything he does ﻿is the will ohOur Lord. That’s what he says. ﻿Who are the men he trusts most? ﻿He has lots of men. I've told you all the ones I know. ﻿Trust! He uses them all. but he doesn't trust any of them. ﻿- What frightens - Nothing. ﻿Or rather, he is frightened of something: a war. ﻿When it was up to him. he waged war. ﻿He never had any qualms when it came to shooting politicians. ﻿But now he says a war could ruin his plan. ﻿What plan is that? ﻿To make Cosa Nostra invisible, like himself, who lives off nothing. ﻿He’s filthy rich. He doesn’t even know how much he's worth. ﻿He could emigrate to South America, but he prefers to stay here. ﻿He lives in one room, he sleeps in a blue sleeping-bag. ﻿He never takes his shoes off in case he needs to make a getaway. ﻿He lives hunted down, he never treats himself to anything. ﻿Why d oes he I ive I ike that? What's the point? ﻿Why are you doing everything to arrest him? ﻿Don't you have a family? You live in Naples. ﻿Why don't you enjoy your family? What's keeping you here? ﻿- I have to catch him. - And he has to give orders. ﻿You know very well that giving orders is better than screwing. ﻿• But I'm on the right side. - He says the same thing. ﻿Thank you for agreeing to see me. ﻿We still haven’t lost our heads completely. ﻿This madness we fell prey to. that has cost us much blood and tears. ﻿can be put an end to. then we can get back to business. ﻿What's the point in waging wars? It makes mothers weep. ﻿wives, children, that’s a ﻿Forgiveness is a rare thing in this world. ﻿am willing to forgive. ﻿Not to forget, because that is impossible, but I will forgive. ﻿I’m ready to ask for forgiveness if I have done wrong. ﻿Here they are! ﻿Where are they going? They're carrying fishing-rods. ﻿■ They're going fishing. - You don’t say! ﻿Let’s go. ﻿These shitheads are fishing. They go fishing every day. ﻿- I thought they were shepherds? - Fishing shepherds! ﻿• What do we do? - What do we do? We wait. ﻿We wait. ﻿Giant, are we sure we'll get somewhere with them? ﻿Or was Mister Shuteye just taking the piss? ﻿Her voice has sounded muffled these last few days, not as natural. ﻿As though it's an effort to talk about the more trivial things. ﻿And a few days ago it sounded like she was weeping. ﻿Perhaps she’s found out her husband is ill. If that is so. he's very ill. ﻿Perhaps she’s just sad because she never sees him. ﻿Roberto, the Giant says the shepherds are moving. ﻿They’ve not gone fishing today. ﻿First they pretended to fish, then they headed for the fields. ﻿I wouldn't get any closer, there’s a sheep pen. ﻿• Have you got the number plate? - Yes. ﻿We have to get out of here. ﻿The meeting with the Lopanes is arranged for tomorrow. ﻿We have to go there prepared. ﻿If Uncle can't convince him with nice ways. ﻿then we’ll have to offer them another solution. ﻿Lopane is a rogu ﻿He might just decide to surprise us. ﻿- Understand? - We’ll take care of it. ﻿Francesco Manara. known as Ciccio. ﻿We arrived at him by following the two shepherds from Ciminna. ﻿He has a conviction for drug smuggling ﻿..and Mafia association. - Peasant Mafia. The type he likes. ﻿We have to keep a close eye on him. ﻿Palermo spends more money than any other Italian city on wiretapping. ﻿- Not that again! - The Ministry has protested again. ﻿• Do you want to read the letter? - No. thanks. ﻿- They want us to make cuts. - Do we catch them with breadcrumbs? ﻿- That’s a good idea. - I'll talk to the Minister. ﻿They want to limit the bugging evices. If they cut the Mafia crimes ﻿..then we can all go home! -You must take it into consideration. ﻿- Tell them to fuck off! - What would that solve? ﻿Nothing, it'll just make me feel better. Let's go. Altieri. ﻿Just think if he quits smoking! ﻿Yes. okay. Manara’s home and car are bugged. It's up to us now. ﻿- That's sorted. - The dogs? ﻿They’re sleeping like logs. ﻿How are things here? ﻿Be careful with that, that stuff costs a fortune. ﻿Don’t worry. ﻿Africa, take your time, we've got all night. ﻿Be careful, these guys notice if a roof tile is out of place. ﻿They’re cutting bugging devices, and we're putting solar panels in. ﻿It’s not my fault there's no electricity. ﻿Come on! ﻿Can you hear me? One. two. three, testing. ﻿• Can you hear me? - She's so beautiful! ﻿-	Can you hear me? -	The boss is here. ﻿Listen to the way she says "oh"? ﻿I like listening to her when she's testing the bugs. ﻿Do you think I've got a problem? ﻿- Put this out. - Right. ﻿Can you hear me? They can't hear me. ﻿Can’t you hear me? ﻿There’s a problem with the bug. they can't hear me. ﻿What’s that? ﻿Nothing, just an idea. ﻿What a nice catch! ﻿We have to make sure the fish is good for Uncle. ﻿But tell us something. Will the Lopanes like the fish? ﻿Who knows! ﻿But the fish will like Lopane. ﻿Manara's picked Patricolo and Cicero up. They're heading for Bagheria. ﻿Don’t let them out of your sight. ﻿Africa, the traffic-light! Go through on red! ﻿- We're behind them. - Be careful. ﻿Not so close. ﻿- Are you turning right here? - I have to check something out. ﻿- Are they turning right? - Keep your distance. ﻿-	All we needed was an Ape! -	It's hiding us. not so close. ﻿• We’re going to lose them. - Slow down. Africa! ﻿What are they doing? ﻿I was right then! ﻿They’ve turned the radio up. perhaps they want to say something. ﻿- What are they doing? - It looks like they're turning back. ﻿• To throw you off? - Perhaps. ﻿Let them go. ﻿The first time he’s made a move, and we have to let him go? ﻿- Let them go! - We've been after them all day! ﻿Let them go! ﻿Fuck! ﻿'m starving. ﻿Why don’t we send your boys to pick up something to eat? ﻿Don’t you trust me? I’ll pay. ﻿Good heavens, no! ﻿But all these people coming in and going out... ﻿The least movement the better. Understand? ﻿All I know is we've been waiting four hours. ﻿You'll have to be patient. ﻿Uncl e can’t just leave the house. ﻿get in a car and make his way here. ﻿Uncle has to take... How can I put it? ﻿- Certain precautions. - Why doesn't he leave earlier? ﻿Uncle leaves when he has to leave. ﻿and arrives when he has to arrive. ﻿Here he is now. ﻿- Everything okay. Uncle? - Fine. fine. ﻿I'm sorry I'm late. ﻿It’s all right. Uncle. It's nice to see you. ﻿- You're looking well. - Thank God. ﻿-	Good day. -	Good day. ﻿Come and sit down. Uncle. ﻿tell you what. ﻿We'll leave these boys here. ﻿We had decided that if the Cappellos wanted to go on living. ﻿they had to remain in America. But now these runaways are coming back. ﻿• Who gave them permission to? - Time. ﻿Twenty years have gone by. ﻿With all due respect. Uncle, the commission sentenced them to death. ﻿And the word of the commission is not like cheese with a sell-by date. ﻿Cosa Nostra has had... too many dead bodies. ﻿We need ﻿we need hand ﻿Hands to work. ﻿heads to think with. ﻿Dead bodies attnaGtjpther dead bodies, and traitors too. ﻿Uncle. they're the worse traitors of all. ﻿• They're Totuccio Cappello's blood. - So? ﻿It doesn't change from father to son. or grandson. ﻿And you're telling me that? Me? ﻿Who was here twenty years ago? Who was here, who gave the orders? ﻿I gave the orders, and Toto did. and we made war on the Cappellos ﻿with these hands! Do you understand, or have you forgotten? ﻿We did good things in the past. ﻿Good things, things that were right. ﻿But we did stained things too. terrible things. ﻿There was a lot of trouble between us. ﻿Then with the state... ﻿It cost us a great deal. ﻿It cost US ﻿to get the whole organization back on its feet. ﻿We had to hide our heads in the sand. ﻿Now. thank God. we can pull our heads out again ﻿and look at the world. ﻿It's no longer the world of yesterday, it’s a new world. ﻿And in this new world ﻿we have to live in a new way. ﻿But I... ﻿There's something I have to do first. ﻿I'll explain when the time is right. ﻿Our cause doesn't need any fresh bloodshed. ﻿And you're not to touch the Runaways. ﻿I'll catch you... ﻿I just know I'll catch you. ﻿• Which one is it? - It's Uncle's home. ﻿- What's wrong? - We’re losing the signal. ﻿- It was a miracle we got in there! - Before it’s empty again... ﻿-	It's impossible in daylight... -	We'll have to do it somehow. ﻿- We have to wait. - Wait! We're always waiting. ﻿Waiting for Manara to talk, waiting for his wife to leave the house ﻿and waiting for him to put a foot wrong. Waiting! ﻿That's Manara’s farmhouse, someone's gone inside. ﻿- How many do I take? - Take two for now. ﻿One of them is Manara. ﻿- Don Ciccio! - Don't say a word. ﻿-	What are they doing? -	Moving things around. ﻿- They’ve gone outside. - We've lost them. ﻿Maybe not. ﻿Matteo! ﻿My son! ﻿Good day. Don Ciccio! ﻿You're so handsome! What will you do to women dressed like that? ﻿- What everyone else does. - If only I were your age! ﻿It's nice, eh? ﻿Sit down. ﻿Let's talk about serious matters. ﻿- Do you mind? - Sorry. Don Ciccio. ﻿-	How far have you got with it? -	It’s almost done, don't worry. ﻿But I am worried. ﻿It means a lot to Uncle, he can't wait long. ﻿Of course, we're practically ready. You can tell Uncle to be prepared. ﻿When? ﻿We’re meeting that person the day after tomorrow, then we're set. ﻿Good. Good. Uncle will be happy to hear it. ﻿Now let’s have a nice hot plate of pasta with sardines! ﻿We have to find out who Manara's talking to. ﻿There are only two roads he can take out of there. The right or the left. ﻿We’ll place Africano here and Giant here, he can't get past us. ﻿-	Film this Matteo's number plate. -	We’d have to cross Palermo first. ﻿Get off your arses, take a motorbike. I want that number plate! ﻿- A motorbike? I'll drive. - You can't even touch the floor. ﻿You're crazy! I have a family waiting for me! ﻿Matteo, one other thing. ﻿Keep quiet. ﻿In the car. at home, on the phone. Keep quiet. ﻿Forget all about this thing. ﻿I'll keep quiet, don’t worry. ﻿Don’t forget I trust you. Don't let me down. ﻿Here he is now. get a move on! ﻿Who is he? ﻿Matteo Canistra. the son of the Villabate boss. Surprised? ﻿Yes. The Canistras have nothing in common with Uncle. ﻿They're different, they like spending money and flashing it. women, clubs. ﻿even drugs. Wh ere do they fit in? ﻿I'll have his mobile checked out. ﻿We'll make up a list of his friends. ﻿He said he's meeting someone the day after tomorrow. ﻿It's the boss's 70th birthday the day after tomorrow, he's planned a party. ﻿Half the people who count in Palermo are going. ﻿And we’ll be going to that party. ﻿Champagne? ﻿Champagne? ﻿Canistra has taken a man to one side, he's given him an envelope. ﻿He's leaving the room. ﻿- Describe him. - Tall. thin, balding. ﻿You'll spot him straight away, he's the only one not in party clothes. ﻿You'll spot him straight away, he’s the only one not in party clothes. ﻿-	Got him. Where's Canistra? -	He's talking to his brother. ﻿Don't lose sight of him. We’ll try and work out who this guy is. ﻿Look at this dickhead! ﻿Listen, come here. ﻿Are you stupid or something? I told you to keep to the right side! ﻿■ I’m sorry. I'm not feeling we - Then why did you come? ﻿• I've a family to support. - Who are you? Where are you from? ﻿- I'm new. it's my first time. - And your last. ﻿Finish the evening and vanish! Now take that tray around. ﻿You're too tall, you stick out! ﻿Giant, congratulations on your Sicilian accent. It was awful! ﻿- Go fuck yourself! - Self-control. ﻿- Wh ere the fuck are they? - Who? ﻿- I’ve lost the Canistras. - What do you mean? ﻿They’re all crowded around the old man. but his sons aren't here. ﻿Bloody hell! ﻿Long live Santuzzo! ﻿- Well? Did you find them? - No. ﻿They've got to be somewhere. ﻿- Is this him? - Yes. Who is he? ﻿He works for Villabate Town Hall. We had him on record ﻿for embezzlement. His name's Calogero Lopresti. ﻿It all fits. The call the Canistras received at 22.30 ﻿..was made from the Town Hall. - Wait! That's important news. ﻿So Calogero Lopresti stays in the office until 22.30. ﻿He calls the Canistras and joins them at the party. Right? ﻿He only stays for a few minutes, just long enough to hand over an envelope. ﻿What the fuck was in that envelope? ﻿Something connected to his work. ﻿Something he couldn't do in working hours. ﻿- Matteo, have you ever seen him? - No. ﻿Uncle. What is it they called him? ﻿-	The Tractor. -	The Tractor. ﻿No grass grows where the tractor's been. ﻿How many has he killed? 50. 100. 200? How many? ﻿It might just be a legend, or it may even be more. ﻿• But it’s an old story. - It might be old. ﻿but there’s got to be a reason he’s still in command. ﻿He uses it to keep the balance. ﻿He's like the Italian President. ﻿..lots of honour, but little power. - Then why are we here? ﻿Because if you do Uncle a favour, a big favour, you profit from it. ﻿It means commanding respect and lots of money. ﻿I know, but he decides who’s going to live and who’s going to croak. ﻿who gets the money and who doesn't. What do you call that? ﻿Isn't that power? ﻿Giuseppe, you're busting my balls! Just relax. ﻿Uncle, this is a great honour for us. ﻿My respects. Uncle. ﻿- Are you Giuseppe? - Yes. ﻿- Matteo? - At your service. ﻿We need three cars. Two on the road in front of us. ﻿Yes. they're waiting down the hill. ﻿Let’s go. ﻿Hurry up! ﻿Look how talented I am. sir. ﻿But breaking in like this... Does the magistrate know? ﻿He knows we’re not in Trento. ﻿What are you insinuating? We're not all crooks in Sicily. ﻿One's enough, and there's always one in the right place. ﻿Asking for the keys here is like putting posters up. ﻿- So we need Africano to do it. - No. we need you to get a move on. ﻿There's nothing here, it looks like he did his normal job. ﻿He must have done something. ﻿He's an executive, he could have used any computer. ﻿Boss, these look ordinary files to me. ﻿But if you want to study them. I can make photocopies. ﻿- All right. - Here we are. ﻿At 21.08 Lopresti opened the births and deaths register. ﻿- And? - Whatever he did wasn’t official. ﻿k He's deleted everything. ﻿Take it easy, nothing can be deleted without leaving a trace. ﻿There’s always a solution. Catch! ﻿This is a Ghost boot pen. ﻿And like a ghost it enters the afterlife to decipher the impossible. ﻿-	Go on. -	Wait. ﻿ere. ﻿He printed out an identity card in the name of Pasquale Spada. ﻿born in Cinisi on February 26th. 1933. ﻿Seventy years old. just like Uncle. See if this man really exists. ﻿He's already in possession of an identity card. ﻿- So this Spada’s got two now. - Except one was for him. ﻿So he needs an identity card. ﻿Uncle, do you mind if we put some music on? ﻿- Go ahead. - What music do you like? ﻿Mina. Have you got anything? ﻿We have. ﻿Don Ciccio Manara told us to take good care of you. ﻿It’s Vito in the first car. Tell me. ﻿- All right. - What did he say? ﻿There’s a police patrol car ahead. What do we do? ﻿We turn off straight away, right? ﻿- Are these guys of ours clean? - They're immaculate. ﻿Drive on then. Phone the second car and tell them to do what I say. ﻿He's talking to them. Good. ﻿You drive on. nice and calmly. ﻿Good boy. ﻿You see. Uncle? The boys would get themselves killed for you. ﻿There’s no need to get killed for me. ﻿Right... ﻿I have reconstructed the calls made by Canistra over the last 3 years. ﻿There are some contacts with minor characters on the Mafia scene. ﻿But there's a strange relationship with a French girl. Aude Dufey. ﻿Tiwo^years ago they exchanged a lot of calls, then nothing more ﻿until last week. ﻿Perhaps the passion for this French girl has returned. ﻿I don't know. ﻿It’s strange he’s connected to these kind of people. ﻿He mustn't have had any choice. ﻿This is a drug for prostate problems. ﻿And two different people bought three boxes of it. ﻿Two shepherds with prostate problems. ﻿Her voice sounds muffled, not as natural. ﻿He's frightened of a war. He uses everyone and trusts no one. ﻿He works for the Town Hall. ﻿He needs an identity card. ﻿The old man’s sick. Very sick. ﻿His wife knows, that's why she's so sad. Fiore was right. ﻿He needs an operation, but it’s too risky in Italy. ﻿That’s where the Canistras come in. ﻿That's where the Canistras come in. ﻿They get hold of an identity card that's valid abroad ﻿and they have the right contact abroad. Aude Dufey. ﻿She is the connection we’re looking for. They’ll have used her as base ﻿and she’s probably the one who found the right hospital. ﻿In Paris. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. ﻿We don't know it's Paris. The French girl works in Lyons and Marseilles. ﻿Canistra called Paris. Fiore, we need the first flight out to Paris. ﻿The light's here. ﻿You use this to call the nurse if you need anything. ﻿And this is for raising and lowering the bed. ﻿They’ll be bringing you something to eat soon. ﻿Don’t worry. Mr Spada. ﻿It’s one of the best clinics in France, you’re in good hands. ﻿We're all in the Lord’s hands. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Wait outside for me. ﻿- Are you sure she can be trusted? - 100% sure. ﻿• Really sure? - Don't worry, everything's fine. ﻿Do you need anything else? ﻿I need to rest. ﻿Then if it’s all right by you. we'll go and get something to eat. ﻿These are our mobile numbers. ﻿And Aude's number too. If you don’t understand something, you can... ﻿My respects. ﻿Leave me alone! Leave me alone! ﻿• Let go! - Calm down! ﻿What does he mean 've used up my credit? ﻿- That you've lost enough. Matteo. - Does he decide that? ﻿- Why are you taking it out on him? - Who else do I take it out on? ﻿Whoever put a limit on your credit card! ﻿The manager! I'll teach the bastard! ﻿- It’s 5 in the morning. - Who cares! ﻿Get her out of here! ﻿- Hello. Maria. - Matteo, it’s 5 in the morning. ﻿Give me the number of the bank manager. ﻿- What's going on? I need some money, hurry up! ﻿All right. ﻿Yes. Where from? ﻿Okay. Canistra called his wife from the Casino at Aix en Provence. ﻿-	That's near Marseilles. -	We'll change our plan. ﻿- They won't refund these now. - We'll fly to Marseilles from Paris. ﻿- And pay for it ourselves? - Of course. ﻿I’ve worked for free before, but never had to pay to work. ﻿to be okay. Uncle. ﻿You’re going to be okay. Uncle. ﻿Don’t worry, we'll wait here for you. ﻿Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. ﻿Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. ﻿on Earth and it is in Heaven. ﻿Give us this day our daily bread. ﻿and forgive us our trespasses. ﻿Turn left at the next road, straight on and we'll come to her home. ﻿- You speak good French. - They're waiting for us there. ﻿All went well. The doctor says you're as strong as an ox. ﻿You're a lucky man. ﻿Our Lord saved my life. ﻿Now... I have to get out of here. ﻿I have to complete my mission. ﻿You’ll have to be patient, you can’t leave here yet. ﻿You need to get your strength back. The surgeon said a few more days. ﻿Thanks. ﻿There's nothing in the kitchen. ﻿We might have something here. ﻿This is the receipt from a bar. and this is from a car park. ﻿Same day. same street, almost the same time. ﻿Let me see. ﻿It doesn't take two hours to drink a cappuccino. ﻿Here's another one. ﻿Same car park, two days earlier. ﻿I need to get in there ﻿Wait for the French police, or there'll be trouble. ﻿They're right in front of me! Put your foot down! ﻿Roberto. don't do anything stupid ﻿512. ﻿THE LAST GODFATHER
