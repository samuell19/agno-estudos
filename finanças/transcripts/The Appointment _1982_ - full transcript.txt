(Pigeon homing in distance) (Crow caws) Man voice: Extract from police report no. 7273 strictly confidential, unpublished and unavailable. Subject, Sandy Fremont. The last positive sighting of the child was on her way home from a school orchestra rehearsal. This was on Tuesday may 14th at approximately 6:30 in the evening. At about this time, her friend Jenny Carr places her positively as entering the footpath through the area known as Cromley Woods a then popular shortcut for several of the students in Millard Heights. Sandy was a popular girl and a rising star with the school orchestra. A music master described her as ”a most gifted violinist” ”with amazing potential. ” General opinion was that, apart from her exceptional musical talent she was a normal, happy and well liked 12-year-old and there was nothing to suggest anything more than the usual friendly rivalries of school life But there can be no doubt that someone thought otherwise. Girl's voice: Sandy. (Giggling laughter) (Giggling continues) Girl's voice: Sandy? Echoing voices: Sandy. (Giggling laughter) Sing-song voice: Sandy... (Distorted growling sound) (Distorted growling sound) Girl's voice echoes: Sandy... (Echoing laughter) (Distorted laughter) (Distorted giggling) Voice echoes: Sandy... (Distorted giggling) Voice echoes: Sandy? (She screams) (Violin crunches) (Chairs scuffle) - (Tapping) - Teacher: Ok, girls, from the top. Ready, Joanne? And... (Violin plays) (Orchestra builds) Teacher: Not too long on the top note, Joanne. - (Music stops) - Teacher: Good. Very good rehearsal, girls. Now, don't forget. Be in your seats at 2 o'clock promptly tomorrow. (Girls chatter) (Indistinct chatter continues) Man voice: Police report no. 727a, update. Shortly after the tragedy a substantial metal railing was erected to seal of and stop the children using the Cromley Woods shortcut and since then, speculation about Sandy Fremont's disappearance has been endless but the truth, as elusive as ever. The conclusion is that although local stones of kidnapping even of witchcraft and alien forces continue It ls felt that there is strong evidence that Sandy Fremont was murdered without apparent motive by an immensely powerful psychopath who will undoubtedly strike again for equally unfathomable reasons. Announcement: Calling Mr. Burgess. Telephone in reception, please. Sign there and there, Mr Fowler, please. - Thank you. - Thank you. Announcement: Mr Burgess. Telephone, please. Toby's transferring the maps and things out of the car now, Ian. Ah, thank you, Mark. If they weren't there, I'm bound to need them. Well, I'm sorry about this, really, but... We always did need the two days, maybe three. Oh, that's alright. I quite understand. I must say, this is a bolt from the blue for me. Something I don't relish at all. You'll be missing the big event, then. Ian: Don't remind me of that, please. Mark: How did she take it? Ian: Joanne? Oh, she doesn't know yet. I know, I know. It's a minefield I've got to cross. - Thanks. - Ian, um... Tell you what. I'll get Claire to lay on some supper tomorrow. Then Dianna and Joanne can come back with us after the concert. Keep the evening going awhile. Kills the anti-climax before it starts. Well, thank you, Mark. That's a great idea. I appreciate it. - So will Dianna. - Don't let on. Just let it happen. It'll have more effect that way. Right. Well, take it easy. Tell Dianna I'll drop the car back like we arranged. Mark, tell me something. As a... A father of three strapping girls how should I approach... Destroying a 14-year-old's dream? Tell her the truth. And do it with kindness, gently. She's a sensitive kid. Artistic. She always has been. Quite apart from that, she worships you. Perhaps a little too much, and that makes you both vulnerable. (Engine stutters) (Engine starts) Course she worships me. She's still only a child. Sure she is. Mark: Just don't make the mistake of telling her that. (Curlew calls) Hello. Did you think I'd forgotten you? That I wasn't coming today? Of course not. How could I? It's just we had to practice. For tomorrow. (Car horn honks) Hello, darling. - Any problems? - No, thankfully. Well, at least you're not stuck with my mini. Thank heaven for that. Mine should be ready tomorrow. Well, perhaps. Mark said he'd pop it round. If you're not in, keys through the letterbox, alright? Oh, well, that's good because with the concert tomorrow night, I'm sure to be in and out all daylong. Yes. And that, of course, is the next drama. Explaining to Joanne that I will not be at her concert tomorrow night after all. Oh, Ian, darling. That's the last thing you should be worrying about. You can't help what happened. And why the hell did it have to be tomorrow, of all days? Oh, it's quarter to five. I'd better go and get the tea things ready. Joanne'll be home in a minute. Dianna? Love you. I should think so. (Engine starts) (Distant chatter) - Bye. - Bye. (Car door shuts) Hello, moppet. "Joanne", daddy, please. Sorry. Sorry, darling, sorry. Mm. Forgot, sorry. What's happened to the car? Well, it's still being serviced. But as I need another one at the crack of dawn tomorrow, thought I'd hire that. Where are you going? I thought you were home tomorrow. No, I've got to go somewhere. You will be back for the concert? Er, darling... I'm sorry, but I may have to be away overnight. You remember I told you about the explosion in our big installation? A lot of men were hurt? Well, I have to be at the inquiry. It's outside London, you see. It... it's several hundred miles away. So, I probably will be away overnight. Joanne, it wasn't planned that way. It wasn't gonna be me going there at all, it was going to be my partner, Tom. But about an hour ago, we... we got this... We got this telephone call. Daddy. Tomorrow, of all days? How could you? Joanne? (Door shuts) You told her, then? Yes. With predictable results. Where... where have you put the towel? Over there. Useful place for a towel. Well, this will be another few minutes. That should belong enough. For what? Your daughter to calm down. Ah. I see. She's "my" daughter now, is she? - She upstairs? - Mm-hmm. Oh, lord. I suppose I... I'll have to pop up there and try and explain things to her. You really think that's a good idea? You've already explained things to her, haven't you? Yes, naturally. Somehow, I think she stopped listening halfway through. I don't think this is the right time. Leave her alone. I mean it. Hmm. She's got to learn, darling. She's only 14 and we... We've got to balance things out a bit more. All this special attention and star treatment she's getting at the school is all very well and I do accept that she's talented and therefore precocious but she has to accept that things cannot be the same here at home. We're a family. We each count. Right. I'm with you. I agree, you're absolutely right. Don't get into another upset about it. Just calm down. Oh, it'll work out. You'll see. I'm not getting into another upset. But you've got to stop thinking that things will work out. They won't. It has to be dealt with. Only the other day, Claire said she was beginning to cut herself off more and more from her school friends. And I know it's right, because... Well, it's like living with a stranger here at home. Oh, darling, that's nothing. She's always been like that. She's never been a very good mixer, has she? Ever since the very beginning, she's always enjoyed her own company more than anybody else's. Her own fantasies, more like. So what does that mean? She's a dreamer, love. You don't know her. You're not around her as much as I am. Oh, come on, that's not fair. She lives in a dangerous world of make-believe. It's hardly dangerous! Look, let... let's just leave it alone. - No, no, no. You said... - No, let's leave it! There... there's too much else to think about. (Distant engines rumble) (Fanfare plays on TV) Joanne: Daddy, why is it you who has to go tomorrow? Ian: I told you, darling. - I'm standing in for somebody. - Who? Ian: My partner, Tom. Why can't he go himself? - Daddy! - What? Why can't he go himself? Because his wife's having a baby and she's fallen ill so she had to go to hospital. Tom's got to stay and look after the 3-year-old and be near the hospital, on hand. - Oh. - Does it have to be tomorrow? Joanne, for heaven's sake! Daddy's got a job to do. Now leave it alone and get ready for bed. It's quite late enough with such a full day ahead of you tomorrow. I can't help it. I'm disappointed. You made me take the course and now at the end of it all, you're not coming to my concert. Dianna: Daddy had to alter his plans. Or rather, they were altered for him. Now, you'll just have to accept it this time. Now, go on. Go to bed. Joanne, you heard your mother. Aren't I special to you anymore? Yes, of course you're special to me. I only did it all because it made you proud of me. Dianna: Joanne! Darling, I am proud of you. I'll always be proud of you. And this has... upset me just as much as it has you, believe me. Please come, daddy. No more, Joanne, this has got to stop! I cannot help what happened and I cannot change it. And believe me, I have tried. You'll just have to accept the fact that this is not some great plot directed against you personally. Now, I must say, for somebody who's so clever and so accomplished in so many ways you are behaving rather selfishly and childishly. I suppose you're such a clever girl that, er... Mummy and I sometimes are inclined to forget that you're still a child. I mean, that's why we do try not to shout at you and not to... Get cross with you. And sometimes, darling, it really is very difficult. Oh, come on, Joanne. Look, darling, just try not to push things so much and rush everything. You're still a child. Relish your childhood, really enjoy it. Try... try and relax. You've got so much time. So much time for everything. Come on. Now, why don't you... Why don't you be a good girl and go up to bed? And try to think about what I've said. Try to understand. And do try to make a few changes. The most important thing is that you should go to bed now and rest ready for tomorrow. Will you go to bed, Joanne? Goodnight, darling. Goodnight, Joanne. (Footsteps retreat) She's getting at you. Why can't you see that? Emotional blackmail, that's all it is. When girls reach Joanne’s age, they're growing up fast. They're full of petty likes and dislikes, jealousy... Sexual uncertainty. Fiercely possessive. And suddenly, being a father is much more difficult. Mm. Say that again. How come she's not difficult with you? Your authority seems to go unchallenged. Because I'm not a man. Oh, darling. Don't be so daft. Anyway, I'll telephone her from the hotel tomorrow evening. See how it went. I mean, that way, she'll know I've been thinking about her. That'll be good. We should be back by 9 o'clock. Anyway, I'd rather appreciate a phone call myself. Darling, could I have some more bedclothes? Thank you. Goodnight, darling.

Dianna. You scared the life out of me. Oh, I'm sorry, darling. Be quiet. We'll wake Joanne. You taken a sleeping pill? - Yeah. - Well, come on. Let's get you back to bed before you fall asleep on the spot. (Footsteps thud) Kept waking up. Strange dream. Very odd. Oh, god, I've got to get some sleep. Hell of a day tomorrow. You've got too much on your mind. - Oh... - Goon. You'll be alright now. - (He sighs) - Goodnight.

Coming! Better be off or I'll be late, mum. Mum? I better be off. I'm sorry, darling, I was deep in thought. Now, come home smartly for lunch and don't hang around daydreaming. I'll be on time. Don't fuss. What time is the rehearsal this afternoon? Two o'clock, so I won't have to leave here till 1:30. - Plenty of time. - Have you got everything? Yes, mummy.

Darling, is that you? - Hang on, sweetheart. Get in, dammit. - (Phone beeps) Of all the stupid inventions... - Darling? - (She laughs) What a lovely surprise! - Hello. - Where are you? You are making good progress, then. Leaving early was a very good idea. No, no. Road's... Clear, it was marvelous. Look, darling, I'm sorry... I'm sorry I disturbed you last night. Oh, well, I... Well, within minutes, it seems. Anyway, look, that's enough of that. Look, I phoned to say good morning. Will you tell Joanne I'm sorry? I... I will be thinking of her tonight. I'm just sorry I can't be there. I think she's forgotten all about it. Well, I'll have some lunch when I get there. Drive carefully, won't you, darling? Well, after last night's dream, you can be sure of that. Last night's dreams? Oh. No, no, darling, nothing... It was just a dream. Darling, really. Well, I dreamt that I crashed the car. These stupid dogs ran out in the road .. Look, the funny thing is... I don't know, I... I seemed to be drunk. - No coordination at all... - (Lorry roars) Seat belt? What about a seat belt? - Ian? - I couldn't hear a thing. (Lorry recedes) Alright, I'm with you now. No, no, all I said was that it seemed to be like... To be like typical dream nonsense, you know, first of all, to make me drunk and then at the same time to have me firmly strapped into the seat belt. Ian, darling. Did you get out of the car? In the dream, I mean. You weren't trapped or anything? Well, I must have. Cos I'm talking to you now, aren't I? Darling. This may sound ridiculous, and don't think me silly... But after we went back to bed last night, I... - (Phone beeps) - Oh. Hang on, I've got some more money, dear. (Phone beeps) Er, darling? Darling, it's jammed. Won't go in. Erm... I'll phone you tonight as arranged, right? Love you. Bye. (Phone disconnects) (Indistinct chatter on radio) (Birds screech) Man on radio: Because the inflation figures that we look at are simply a measure of how much prices have gone up in the previous 72 months.
