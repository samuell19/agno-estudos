I showed up in disguise because I don't want people to know If you're interested I can tell you I grew up in Japan Kamen Rider was my idol From then onwards I have used different masks to help the underdogs and punish the evil doers It never dawned on me The person I saved that day was the love of my life He's talking about you Li, I'm glad to see you again I didn't expect my hero to show up at the right time and save me It was so dangerous If you didn't show up I don't know what would happen I know it's been a while But I still remember red is your favorite color You like black You like red bean pudding You like wasabi How romantic!

Yes, they ordered goose intestines fish balls and hard boiled eggs Allegedly it can reduce loss of fluid Let's have hotpot tonight and try the eggs... Shut up! What are they up to? We have 2 more weeks to go How is He Jin Yin getting on with his drill? Let's take a look Come on baby, let's go for fun... Yeah! Don't run... What's this? Stop fooling around!

We're here to observe It should be alright Says who? I heard someone will be killed tonight You better be prepared No! Why not? When He Jin Yin goes down and we rush him to the hospital Make sure you get close ups of his blood I want blood gushing out What if he's dead? You'll get a raise, I'll get a promotion and we'll celebrate with champagne In this match between David and Goliath Will there by mercy? We'll do our best in the ring What about your opponent? Will you kill him by accident? No comment! Rumor has it you're pushing for death to boost the TV ratings, is that true? That's a lie, it's impossible You opponent seems ill prepared, is this a ploy? Has he completed his training? What happens if you lose? With a body like yours will you consider making a porno film? Never! I'll only make martial arts films Sorry... Wait! Sorry... The world is full of morons asking all these dumb questions How can I lose? Appearance is deceiving... What is He Jin Yin up to? Are you alright? Where's Li? Is she here? Don't be afraid... I put my money on you No, I better bet... Who's afraid? Get ready, you're on in 10 minutes Even though all of us bet on Duan Shui Liu to win We're actually rooting for you We made you a robe Took us all night Thanks! Before I get in the ring I'd like to see Li I've already checked, she isn't here yet Are you ready? Round 1! I'm scared, Vivian Don't be, there's still 1 more minute Perfect timing I don't want them to fight Aren't you rooting for Duan Shui Liu? No, I must tell Yin to forfeit What? What's going on? This can't be happening! Don't do this! Anyone out there! Help! Open up! "Happy Boxing Championship" All cameras stand by Happy Boxing Championship will begin, yeah... First one out is Karate expert Duan Shui Liu nicknamed The Killing Machine Karate is about causing damage all Karate experts have trained every part of their bodies to be destructive breaking ice chopping wood splitting stones breaking bottles Duan Shui Liu is particularly outstanding His punch has enough power to smash a water melon Talk is cheap Bring out your cameras and see for yourself Next up from the Ancient Chinese Boxing school The master Devilish Muscle Man is the arch enemy of Karate According to our sources Other than making a mean cup of tea He hasn't learnt much That's why this duel is considered a suicidal attempt What prompted him to do this is still a mystery From the murderous look on his face He seems to have something up his sleeve making this into a greater mystery I'm backing you! Thank you, Auntie Watch it! I banked all my money on you that you'll go down in Round 1 Please step down... Remember to go down in Round 1 I'll do my best Let's welcome our 2 contestants They will carry on for 3 rounds In case we can't take any pictures later While they're still alive take a good one Say cheese! Good... This way The vote from the press is here in my hand He Jin Yin wins the best costume award Now... Duan Shui Liu will give out the award Smile! We want your picture Smile! Thanks! The match will be gruesome Mr. He did well with the costume Looks like they are ready to go Slaughter seems inevitable The match has begun Duan Shui Liu is like a tiger out of a cage They're fighting ferociously Hey... Why did he turn his back? Must be some trick In terms of skill You're no match for him What I'm teaching you is the highest realm of Ancient Chinese Boxing Psychological warfare We wined and dined ourselves for a month He became increasingly suspicious After a month of this If you turn your back on him I guarantee that for Round 1 He won't come near you He's luring me over I shouldn't be afraid of him I'll tough it out Damn! Did he see through the trick? What are they doing? Tell them to fight I can't comment if they don't move! Focus on the commentator Make up something If you get me fired, I'll kill you What can I say? Use this! The Dragon Saber? What's wrong with you? Keep talking! Come on! Hurry! I can't believe this! Come on! The Lion King, no... Duan Shui Liu strikes with Qi Shang Fist which is deadly This is outrageous! I don't know what I'm saying! Just keep up the bullshit! Zhang Wu Ji... no... He Jin Yin fought back with the Magic Move and dissipated Qi Shang Fist What? Magic Move? He Jin Yin bellowed and dissipated Qi Shang Fist He Jin Yin bolted from here to there Duan Shui Liu can't even tell which one is the real He Jin Yin He frowned and made up his mind He yelled out to his Master summoning the dead to his assistance Don't worry! I have another one Duan Shui Liu fell into He Jin Yin's arms He closed his eyes His tender lips slightly open breathing out... "Jin Ping Mei"? Don't worry... keep reading What is he talking about? He Jin Yin is enjoying himself Thinking the girl has fallen for him He feels her supple skin and her tender hands like cotton candy He feels that... Shut up! What the hell are you saying? I'm talking to you! You gave me no choice You weren't fighting How can we carry on the broadcast? Some reporter you are! You know how to run a show? How we run a show is none of your business Quiet! Do me a favor! Did you hear him? What's wrong with you? Fight your match and stay out of my business You won't move, I had to make something up! How can you blame me? Quiet! End of Round 1 Yeah... Are you alright? I'm scared! Don't worry! Chief I know He's bluffing by turning his back I'll hit him from behind We'll see if he's courageous What are you up to now? Is it a foul? He's tossing a hammer and a knife So what? He might stab me We'll deal with it when he does The law will punish him Just get on with the fight It's so boring If you get through Round 1 He'll get restless In Round 2, we'll go one step further Scare him What's this? I'll kill you See that! He's hit! It can't be! Did you see that? Stay out of trouble, cripple! Or I'll come down and get you Don't blame me! Duan Shui Liu is hit again! Why doesn't he fight back? He's been kicked Anything else? Give it here! Nothing It seems I'm wounded Don't worry, the durian is not poisonous Oh! Damn! Commercial break! Oh! Yang Yin Pill, warm like the sun Why is there no sound? Perhaps no battery Can't be! Are you trapped inside? Yes! What's wrong with you? We've been in here for half an hour! Fine! We'll let you wait another half an hour No! Please let us out! The sun is out... Round 3! Kill him That'll only take a second Look at that garbage! He's nothing! Everything is just an act! Don't say that! Every morning He gets on a high speed truck swinging around like a lunatic Can that be some special skill? Skill my ass! Get lost! He doesn't scare me! Is this a foul? Of course The pose is obscene He Jin Yin is clamped down You're mistaken He Jin Yin is in control Right! The perfect defense is called The Clamp We must practice with a truck It is most destructive The key is to clamp down your opponent Lock him in position... Let go of me, garbage! I'm not garbage! I can't stand it Let go! Stop this! You're the garbage! Good work! Yeah... Be careful! Asshole! I'll be rid of you! Hold on! Don't let go! Don't let go! Let go! Please let me go! Stop it!
