"I am. Come into... ...my garden. My sister. My spouse. I have... ...gathered... ...my myrrh... ...with... ...my... ...spice. I have... ...eaten... ...my... ...honeycomb... ...with my... ...honey. I sleep... ...but... ...my heart... ...weakens. My beloved... ...put in... ...his hand... ...by the hole... ...of the... ...door. My sister. My love. My dove. My beloved. My... Though he were dead, yet shall he live... ...and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me... ...shall never die. For as much as it has pleased Almighty God of His great mercy... ...to take unto Himself the soul of our dear brother here departed... ...we therefore commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life. ♪ Venus must have heard my plea ♪ ♪ She has sent someone ♪ ♪ Along for me ♪ - Are you all right? - I'm fine. You should take it easy. You're gonna be drunk. I know. I wanna be drunk. You're gonna get sick. No, I won't. Don't you think maybe you should help your mother? Yeah. I'm all right, Nicky. Is there anything I can do? If you'll take... ...some food through. That lot should eat something before the drink gets the better of them. - I will, ta. - Right. He was a great bloke, your dad. I know. I didn't really know him, but everybody says that he was just... ...a nice guy. - What are you drinking? - I'm drinking' wine. Wine? You wanna move on to the hard stuff. - Hard stuff? - Yeah. Whiskey. This is the gear. I'm telling' ya. - So what do you do, eh? - I'm at school. Jesus. Really? I would have thought you were 22, 23. Hey, have you ever been in Tropicoco? - No. - Well, you know the Animals? Chas Chandler. Have you heard of him? Me and him are like this. I'm telling' you. - I can get us in anytime you want. - Wow. - We can go tonight, if you want. - Ask me mum. - Where'd you get the tie? - This is from Carnaby Street. Nicky, love. Nic, come here. Come in here. Come on. Now, this is Bob's mum, Grace. This is Nic. - Hello, Grace. - Our Susan's boyfriend, you know? - And Arthur, his dad. - Hello, Bob. Nice to meet you. He's a nice lad. What do you do for a living, Bob? - It's Nic, man. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Nick with an "N." - With an "N"? Ah. Bob, what do you do for a living? Um, nothing. - He plays the guitar. Bob Dylan's songs. - Badly. - You gonna help us with the washing'? - I was looking for Susan. No. Stay and help us. Oh, look at him. Look at him. Look at this! Hey, June, come here. Feel this. Look how smooth! Have you started shaving yet, son? Aye. Hey, I'm sorry, love. - I'm gonna have some more. - Susan. - What about her? - Where is she? She's went to bed 'cause she was drinking far too much... ...on which, I need another sherry. I said, "If you're sick..." cause she looked like she was gonna hoick... ...on that new carpet, "I'll rub your bloody nose in it." So I've sent her to bed and she should be sleeping'. All right? So if she is... Grace, man, just lay off. - So if she's sleeping, let her sleep. - I will. Thanks. Good night. He'd kill me. No. Look. Oh, look. Have you noticed the way he walks? He must practice in the mirror. Piss off, sunshine. Jesus! Fuck! Not on my fucking jacket! Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Fuck! It's all over my best shirt. So, how was the meeting? It was fine, I think. Meaning? Meaning fine. Meaning, I think they like the project. They'd like to work with me. They're having a meeting on the budget. They'll call later with an answer. Where are they gonna call you? - Where are they gonna call you? - At the cottage. I thought we agreed not to give out that number... ...unless it's an emergency. - I think it was important. - Everything in your life is important. I don't think it qualifies as an emergency. Shut up. I'm gonna pee. Does Michael want to come? Mikey, do you wanna go? No? When you grow up... ...would you like to be a policeman? Yes, sir. Have you actually... ...ever seen a dead body? No, sir. Would you like to see a dead body? Yes, sir. I thought so. A body that has been in the River Tyne for three weeks... ...swells up to at least twice its size. By the time the chemicals, the fish... Those that survive the River Tyne... Well, it makes our job of recognition... ...that little bit more difficult. Now, boys... ...this woman... ...has been stabbed to death with a bread knife. Ninety percent of crimes... murders... Are committed by people who know each other... ...love each other... ...like your mums and your dads. Now this chap here... ...went to the central station... ...went to the gentlemen's toilet... ...locked himself in a cubicle, took off his right shoe, his right sock... ...put the muzzle of the gun in his mouth... ...and with his big toe, he pulled the trigger. Come on! Hurry up! Come on, Nic. There's been an accident at the factory! - Do you want some coffee? - Yeah. Okay. Sorry. You better go soon, or you'll miss your bus. I'll get the next one. - No. - Let me. - They'll wake up. - No, they won't. - I love you. - You're just saying that. No, I'm not. I do. Oh, shit. Hello, Dad. You all right? Susan, get me some water, please. Here. - Jesus fuckin' Christ! - Shh. Shh. You're all right. Hello, Nic. How are you doing? Fine, Mr. Brown. How are you? Oh, you know. Where's my swimsuit? In that beach bag. I took it in. It's not in the beach bag. Which beach bag? I couldn't find it. - Well, we only have one. - No, there wasn't. There were two. He's crying whether he's happy or whether he's sad. Why did you tell him? - Hey, excuse me... - Fuck off! Fuck off! Listen, I've got a gun. Sorry. Sorry! Come on Nic. There's been an accident at the factory! Hey! It is a mistake, a sin. Of course, you are right... ...and I agree with you, but I sympathize with the mother. Fifteen years old and no family and no father has come forward. They say she sinned with everyone in the village... ...how could they tell who the father was? They say it is Gio's. She has no money, what else could she do? Give them to the Lord. To split them in that way. Twins should stay together. And to send one of them to England. That place of heresy. It's a sin I tell you, a sin. They're now treating as murder... ...the death of a suspected Loyalist terrorist inside the Maize prison. The body of David Keyes was found in his cell early yesterday. Initially, it was thought that he had hanged himself... ...and officials from the Northern Ireland office... ...said there was no evidence of foul play. But following a postmortem examination, the R.U.C. announced... ...they've begun a murder investigation. The public inquiry into the killing... ...of the black teenager; Stephen Lawrence, started today. He was stabbed to death in a racist attack in South London in 1993. The inquiry was ordered last year by the home secretary... ...after Stephen Lawrence's family claimed the police failed... ...to gather sufficient evidence in the hours after his death. The Vatican is expected to ask forgiveness from Jews today... ...over allegations that it failed to speak out... ...against the Nazi holocaust during the Second World War. After ten years of consultation, it's issuing a document... ...giving the Roman Catholic Church's first official response to the claims. The imprisoned Israeli nuclear technician, Mordecai Vanunu... ...has been moved out of solitary confinement for first time in 12 years. Israeli agents abducted him from Europe... ...and he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for revealing details... ...of the Israeli nuclear weapons program to the Sunday Times. Traffic's very slow anticlockwise on the M25... ...in Hertfordshire between St. Albans and the A405. Drivers are slowing down to look at a car involved in an earlier accident. - Terminal two, Heathrow, please. - All right, darling. Hello. Luca? Fuck off! Hello. Listen, don't hang up. Everything took much longer than I thought. I had to pick up the film from the lab at 1:00... ...and the truck wasn't ready when they said it was going to be. So why didn't you ring? Baby, baby, don't give Luca a hard time. You know I'd rather be in bed with you than doing this boring stuff. So why didn't you ring? There wasn't a phone I could get to, baby. And your mobile? Are you going to forgive me? No, probably not. But we'll get over it. What the fuck do you want? Listen, I can't make it to the airport in time... ...to meet with the English director: And Charles is shooting a commercial all day and... You can't ask Maria... ...because you slept with me and she found out. I can't. My car is being serviced. It's okay. Take a taxi. Listen, someone's got to meet the guy. I was going to wash my hair. Good idea. There's plenty of time. Impress him with your English. You need this job. No, Luca, you need this job. They haven't decided on a sound recordist yet. Baby, don't be cruel to Luca. Gotta go now. Okay, okay. No, wait a moment. Oh, dear. Very nice, charming people. I like Italians. I wanna talk to you right away. Well, I'm in the Rome Airport. It's full of Italians. Yeah, I will get in touch. Nicholas? Claudia. Hi. It's good to see you. Good to see you. Are you all right? Yeah. It's the pollen or something. I feel such a fool. I have bad reactions sometimes. It's all right. I'm authorized to take you to dinner. Come on, then. Let's go. Let's go. You must be Luca. You know, these roads are crazy. I was once on a mountain road in Egypt, and we came around a corner very fast... There's one lane, not two lanes... and this guy was sitting there. He just decided to stop on the bend and eat his dinner. You know, sitting in the road with a juggernaut, this big lorry... ...on the curve of the mountain, you know. It's crazy. This is beautiful. I could stay here for a very long time. That's a good point, but I would take a slightly different line... ...that when you were talking about the batteries... I mean, we could carry them out. I know that means we're putting a greater strain on our own engines... ...and therefore using more fuel, therefore creating more emissions. It's a real problem, but we have to weigh up... ...the environmental... ...evangelism... ...the benefit of that from the movie we're making... ...as opposed to the actual impact we make... ...bringing our cameras and vehicles to the places we want to film. When we were in Antarctica... ...we were very conscientious about not leaving any scrap... ...of waste. I mean, we carried out our own shit. It's absolutely one thing talking about... ...all these Third World countries, but the fact of the matter is... ...some of our worst experiences have actually come from Europe. Paris, for example. Tell you what's funny. Have you ever been homeless in Paris? Now that's a fricking trip. Eventually I met this guy who let me crash with him. Really cool guy. And he took me out to a few places and stuff. I became aware that Paris sort of functions... ...on this totally sort of different level sometimes. They have a great time. But it's weird how it was so separated from mainstream Parisian society. Harassment by police and stuff... You know, that was like being in a Third World nation. Or what was supposed to be a Third World nation. Here's another thing. What is this Third World nation bollocks? Beautiful today though, isn't it? The thing about the Indonesians, they've got 13.000 islands... ...and they're still expanding and clearing the forests... ...more rapaciously than the Japanese ever did in Borneo. It's a wicked situation. And the Dani are really being hounded into extinction. You've gotta remember, these people were only discovered in the early '50s. They're Stone Age people. There was an American flyer... ...who crash-landed, came across them. It's extraordinary. You know, one of the things about their diet... ...is that there were no large mammals on Irian Jaya. So the cannibalism, although it had taken on a ritualistic... ...symbolic significance... ...it was actually about their need for protein. When they bring in a prisoner from another tribe... ...they tie them up and then get the small children... The four-year-olds and five-year-olds... To beat the prisoners... ...to become very used to the cruelty... ...to assimilate this capacity... ...to kill without any emotion. It's very effective. And then the beaten, broken bodies are dragged into these fire pits... ...where they're baked on the hot rocks. Listen. Just pick up everything you've got and get in the gym. Come on. Out. Just take everything with you. - Not ready, Nic? - No, sir. - What's the problem? - Not well, sir. Not well? Again? Sir. Have you got a note? Lost it, sir. My mother said that... I'm not interested. What to do? What do you think? - Don't know, sir. - Here's what we'll do. You strip off, then come in the gym. - Yes, sir. - All right? Everybody does P.E. And I mean everybody. The reason we do P.E. is to keep our bodies fit and healthy. And also get rid of any excess fat we might have. Boys, take one shoe off. This may teach you a lesson. And then again, maybe it won't. But I've tried everything with you. I've bent over backwards to help you. - Haven't I? - Yes, sir. Now, run to the end and back to me... ...until I say stop. Luca, that's the new Sennheiser. I've used it. Thought it was incredible. How do you find it? Hey, hotshot. I was in that spaghetti western too. Speaking of spaghetti, I thought your pasta was incredible. Thank you. I hope your sound recording is half as good. Luca, what's the hurry? Take it easy. Put on some nice music and just relax. This isn't good for the equipment. Where? This is what you English call "field recording," yes? That's right. You fucking whore. What are you? A fucking whore! Don't touch! Stop! Stop! What is it? Oh, dear God. Shit! No, don't move him. Don't move him. Shit! Press. Press firmly. Do what you can. It's in the front. Do you speak English? We have to stop the bleeding! We're very sorry. My friends and me... ...we will go... ...but we will come back with polizi. We... ...need to go... ...but we will come back. We are very sorry. This was an accident. Yes. One moment. What's going on? He wants one of us to stay. It's his only guarantee we're gonna come back. - Makes sense. - I'll stay. - Men, I've got a plan. - What? Let's get in the car and fly away as soon as we can. It's very simple. I'll stay here. If you guys don't stop, you can be back here... Why should you stay? I'll stay. He should stay. He was driving. - No, I'm going to stay. - Absolutely not. Because I'm a woman I should be treated differently? This is the best idea. I am just as guilty as everyone else, okay? It would be much less volatile with a woman staying here. It won't be threatening or aggressive. I will stay. It's my project. I'm the producer. It would be a relief to be out of the car. I'll be fine. Look, I'm here. How long will you be?
