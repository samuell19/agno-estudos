My grandfather brought me to the riverbank for the first time. That day, it suddenly became dark even during the day! A small moon eclipsed such a big Sun! The sun wins every day. But the moon too has its day! Excuse me, Ma’am. What was the reason, you fought this battle against norms of religion, society and tradition? No religion teaches us discrimination. Anyway, I was not fighting against anybody. In fact, I was fighting for someone’s rights. Nobody can deny anyone's rights. Last year, you won a battle for the rights of transgenders and street children. And now, for the widows. Do you think India is changing? This is just the beginning. There is a long battle ahead of us. That was Senior Advocate of Supreme Court - Noor Saxena. Holi celebrations will be different this year since an ancient tradition will be discontinued. Tomorrow, for the first time, the widows of Vrindavan and Banaras will play Holi. The people involved in this historic win include Advocate Noor Saxena, Amit Tripathi and Bindu Khanna. It’s a very big day, not just for the law, but for equality and freedom and most importantly for the new India. They call you an untouchable, right? You rise so high, scale such heights that these people cannot even touch you! I’m finally going home after 24 years to fulfill a promise. It’s the same city which gave me everything and then took it all away. I hope that Mother Ganga will recognize her daughter. Would Chintu and the lanes of Banaras also be waiting for me? Chhoti, I will never let you fall. No, no, whatever you say, this Holi, I will splash color on you. This is my promise to you. No Chhoti, I am forbidden to play with colors now. Everyone left me one by one. I will never leave you alone. Liar! I swear by the River Ganga. We will see! Chhoti... Ma’am! Hope you had a safe journey. Ma’am, everything is arranged. The Holi colors and flowers are here. I was awake all night! It’s such a big occasion, just because of you. We are so proud of you, Ma’am. I have ordered new sarees for all of them. The room upstairs is ready. Just... Just a small problem now. The local people are creating a lot of commotion. They are complaining to the police that the widows can’t play Holi. -Hmm. -We have the legal documents. But we are finding it difficult to handle the situation. They are raising sensitive issues. There is no security for us. Even the cops are supporting them. Ma’am… Ma’am, is everything okay? Excuse me, Ma’am? My Chhoti, My Moon Chhoti. Chhoti. Look, I got this pigeon for you. Did you buy it with the gambling money? No, I caught it at the riverbank. Liar! You have again lost all the money in gambling. Now all the children will go to school except me. You were making tall promises. What happened now? Broke all your promises? I gulped the chewing gum also because of you! Keep your pigeon with you. Chhoti, sorry. Chintu, only four months are left for the festival of Holi. Then schools will reopen. If we don’t pay 300 rupees to the school, I won’t get admission yet again. We will work hard, sell flowers and walk on the rope. We will earn the money somehow. Just stay away from the police and that slimy shopkeeper. Don’t fall into their trap again. -People, bet some money. -Go ahead. Miser! Chhoti, walk fast! Come on, walk. Chhoti, got two rupees! Come on, brother, bet some money. Should we pay you for the same show every day? But you have won many times. This time, tell her to walk without the stick. Only then will I bet. Chhoti, walk without the stick! And what if I fall? My bones will break, what will you lose? My life! Look, here they are. Again, they have put up their show. Chintu, run… Police! Catch them! They don’t change despite getting beaten up. -Get lost from here! - Run! Get lost from here. They do business and we get scolded. They put up a show here like they own the place. Stop! Where are you going? Stop! Damn you! I won't spare you today. Stop! Get them! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey... Chintu... Chintu! Chintu! Stop, you dog! I work hard to earn money and he enjoys it. You dog! Let me wash my feet, then I will handle you. Bloody dog, rascal! He ran away with all the money. If I find him again, I will set him on fire. If the police nab him, he will get jailed again. He's so snotty! He took all my money. Rogue! Hey, hey. Hey Chhoti. Come here. Where were you? Come. All of them are rogues. Wonder where they come from. They don’t know who their parents are nor about their caste or community. Yes, Aunty. Street children and a wrestler’s pants, if not kept tight, -will embarrass you. -Give me tea. Give me tea. Giving you tea, let me finish cleaning first. Oh God! Where is she? Must have gone to bring disgrace to our family. You doubt the sacredness of Lolark Kund. The priest said your wife is immoral. She pretends to take a dip in the step well. But, she doesn't even touch the water. Hail to the Mother Goddess! It is the most sacred step well in the world. Women come from everywhere to take a dip in it and get blessed with a son. But, your wife has given birth to three girls, and not even one son! She has tarnished the image of the entire clan. Hey... You are back? Come. Come, sit here. Come, please sit. Sit. Bittu... Yes, Dad. Quickly make tea for your Mom. She has taken a dip and must be feeling cold. Go, make it quickly. I... I will make it. Sit, my darling. Sweety... Sweety... Warm up some oil quickly. Your mother goes barefoot to take a dip. She must be feeling cold. If you take care of your mom, then she will be able to go every day. God Lolark will be pleased. And will bless you with a brother. Right? Go. Am I right? Tell me, am I right? Yes. -What? -Yes. I am right? Do you think I am mad? Do I look mad? I know, you go there every day. But, you don't even touch the water! If you don't give birth to a son in a year... I will drown you in the same step well. Now... go. Get lost! Go. Chintu, where are you roaming? You have saved only 60 rupees. Haven't I saved 300 rupees? Not yet. We walk on the rope and sell flowers also. It takes a lot of hard work to earn 300 rupees. Listen... I have a solution. -What? -Will you gamble? No, I will not gamble. Chhoti gets upset with me. You will make 300 rupees in just one day. If you don't tell anything to the police. Only four months are left, my dear. You promised Chhoti to send her to school. In gambling, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. But this time, I am sure you will win. Come by tonight. -Hello. -Inspector Raja? Salutation, Sir! There are a lot of complaints about gambling scandals in your area. Yes, Sir. I want all this to close down. Okay, Sir, will lock all of them. Lock up anyone caught in gambling. Everyone will be locked. Raja, if you want a promotion, get this sorted. -Should we lock up transgenders too? -As you wish. Antiwar, lock up all the gamblers including children. You fought with everyone just because they drove away Bhura. Yes. -And where is Bhura? -He ran away. Ran away! -Where will you stay now? -Don't know. Don't know! Let's think about it. -Will you stay with me? -Yes. No, you are very naughty. Last time also you had troubled us a lot. I don't trouble anyone. In fact, people trouble me. Naughty girl, as if I don't know how mischievous you are. Let's watch this movie? -No need to watch any movie? -Please, you never watch any movie. -I said I will not come. -Please come. No movies, please. Come on, see this. I said no movies, don't you understand? You never come along for a movie. I get scared. Why? When I was a kid like you, my parents abandoned me in this movie hall. The name of the movie was Mughal-e-Azam. So, I named myself Anarkali after the name of the actress. Understood? Why did they leave you? Chhoti, understand one thing. You receive love as a right; never beg for it. But, why did they leave you? For me! Chhoti, you go. -You also come with me. -I said, go. Let go. Leave! Chhoti, you go. You didn't come last night? You should have sent her at least? I am not your wife that I have to surrender to you every night. But you are opening your mouth a lot these days. Better keep it shut! Or else, you will lose your life. Did you get that? Come tonight! Or else, will not spare your Chhoti. You are at the riverbank today also? You are here all the time? I mean, you come here every day? Even I come here every day. But I have never seen you before. I see... I come here in the afternoon. You must be coming in the morning and leaving by noon. These ants got a sharp sting! Be careful before sitting. I walk on the rope in the morning. Should I show you how? Like this, keeping my hands free and without any fear. Sorry for yesterday. You have forgiven me, right? I didn't do that intentionally. Foreigners say that if you say sorry, you get pardoned. You have forgiven me, right? You don't speak at all? Sorry again. These ants only bite me! Do you know? Your eyes are like Bhura. I found him today morning. He was sitting in a corner when I went for a bath. He had big eyes, small hands, small feet... and a cute tail. -Tail? -Yes. A puppy's tail! He was badly injured. When I petted and loved him, he started crying. Why? Maybe he isn't used to being loved. Maybe he isn't used to being loved. Sorry for yesterday. What's the matter? Today, you are so late? Is everything alright? The room was very dirty. And you've come so late. I was looking for the broom, but couldn't find it. Otherwise I would have cleaned the room. I will clean the room. Had you used so much vigor with your wife, you would have got a son by now. You bitch! These policemen are troubling us so much. They neither let us live or die. I want to be a police officer, so that I can beat them. I promise to become a police officer, just to protect you. No way! I will throw you in the River Ganga. I will swim and come back to you! You talk big things, but in reality even a calf scares you! Hello! Good morning! You tea drink? What? You tea drink? You carry this big book. But you don't know English? Don't worry, I will teach you. Wait, I will get some tea first! Give me two cups of tea. -Do you have money? -Here it is! Keep it at a distance. What the... Wants a two cups of tea! What will you do with two cups? You just give me tea. What will you do with two cups? You will have one, what about the other? For that widow? One untouchable and the other a widow! It's rightfully said... beware of widows, bulls, stairs and saints to attain salvation. Don't know where the hell they've come from? Take it! Go! Have you added sugar? I've put some poison, will you drink it? If the sugar is less, I will throw it on your face. What if I throw you in the River Ganga? Idiot! Miser! Get lost! Take this. No, I don't drink tea. -Take it. -No, I can't have it. Hold it, it's very hot. What's your name? Chhoti. What's your real name? Chhoti. That can't be a name. This is how we are named. Anyone who is fat is called 'Fatso'. Anyone with one leg is called 'Lame'. I am small, so I am called 'Chhoti'. You must be having another name? Do these stray dogs have any names? Where are you going? Hey! She wasted my money. She didn't even have the tea. Chhoti! Such a sweet name. With her small hands she was driving away flies around my tea. What? You had tea? We are only allowed to have rice and water. Someone thought about me for the first time. I always had my doubts about you. Still, I gave you shelter here. Such a small girl and talking so sensibly. Allowed you to stay in my room. And gave you food to eat. -You sinner! -Couldn't have the tea. I will tell everyone what you do outside the Ashram. She must have felt bad. Such a small girl. You've made the room so dirty! And now you are off to sleep. Get up and clean everything. I've got sacred food for you. Have it. Do you know? When I came to this riverbank, all the children would bully me a lot. Hmm. But, Chintu would always protect me. He would say... "Don't worry, Chhoti, Chintu is there for you." He would always return before the prayers get over. But, he didn't come back. Where did he go? He picked a fight with the cops. Don't know. Never mind. Things that are ours, always find a way back to us. Don't worry, eat this. Should I wear this and go? Wait, you'll ruin them. It's pure leather. Go, get the brush. Give it to me! I need some money. Why? Is your Mother getting married? No, I have to pay the school fees. The school has sent a notice. Did I ask you to send them to school? Let them be at home and train them in household chores. Or else, they will also ruin their husband's house like you. But education is important too. Just give me a son, not wisdom! Why do you always wear a white saree? Why not a colorful one? There is an age-old tradition. Once a woman's husband dies, she has to wear only white. Why? So that she always remains colorless. Okay. Which is your favorite color? What is favorite? Favorite. What's that? You don't know English at all. Which color you like the most? Pink. -Pink? -The pink that Queens of Jaipur often wear. The deep shade of pink! I see. I am leaving now. You come tomorrow evening. Where? Come for evening prayers at the riverbank. -But, I can't come in the evening. -No excuses. I am not allowed to leave the ashram in the evening. You have to come. I will get Anarkali also. You have to come, please. Stay away! How many times have I told you to stay away from my belongings? You are already tainted and want me to become a sinner? Oh God, give her some wisdom. -Hail Rukmini! -Hail Radha! -Hail Rukmini! -Hail Radha! Hail Lord Krishna Who dons peacock feathers! Hail Lord Krishna Who dons peacock feathers! Good... Good... Good morning, you can't even say it properly. Good morning, you can't even say it properly. You embarrassed me yesterday and now you are laughing. Sorry. I had told everyone my friend was coming. Anarkali also came there. You let me down. I was trying to call you but didn't know your name. My name is Noor. Noor? What kind of a name is this? My Grandfather used to say that when I was born my face was glowing like the Kohinoor! That's why he named me Noor. What's Kohinoor? 'Kohinoor' is the name of a precious Heera, a diamond. Heera? That's the name of that fat cop. You know what happened once? That policeman Heera was chasing everyone. While running, Chintu's pants came off. But, he kept running without his pants... naked! Do you know? These lamps are lit twice. Once, when you ask for something. And then, once again when your wish is fulfilled. -I see. -Yes. Which means all those who bought lamps from me will come back to buy it one more time? Yes, they will. Have you ever lit a lamp? Yes, I have lit it once. -When? -When I got married. I was married off to an old man. But he died after some time. -Your husband was old? -Yes. What's there to laugh? I said my husband was old and you are laughing. Let me help you. Take this. Chhoti, wait for me. I promise to return before the prayers get over. What are you doing here? How did you come here? I came here looking for you. Where have you been for the last two days? What happened? I want you to meet Noor tomorrow. I can't come tomorrow. Well... I have a dance show tomorrow. I want the two of you to meet. Sometimes, she is not there and at times, you are not there. I am the only one trying so hard. I don't want to introduce anyone anymore. -Wonder where Chintu has gone. -Chhoti. -Now you two refused to meet... -She doesn't even listen. -My life is messed up! -Chhoti... Where's Anarkali? She has a dance show elsewhere. But I came to meet her. Let her be. I've got something for you. What? Look! No! No, no... No, I am not allowed. Meaning? It means I cannot apply any color. No, I will apply it. You will look very pretty with color. No, Chhoti. What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't do it, Chhoti. Someone might see us. Don't do it. Please let me do it. Enough, stop it now. It looks so pretty! Enough, stop it now. Hey! Where's Anarkali? I don't know. What are you doing? Get out of here. You pretend to be this big cop. Can't handle your pants, how will you handle Banaras? Get lost! Let's go, Chhoti. Where are you taking me? I am taking you to a place where nobody comes. Come. -Come. -Where have you brought me? Every time I make a mistake, I come here to hide. Have you been scared of colors since childhood? No, I used to play a lot with colors when I was a child. I used to dress like Radha during Holi, and would dance and play with colors. I see. This year, you will play Holi with me. No, now I don't celebrate Holi. I am not allowed to play Holi. No, no, whatever you say. This Holi, I will splash color on you. This is my promise to you. No, Chhoti. Now, I can't play with colors. You used to dance like Radha? Please dance and show me once. -No, now I can't dance. -No, please show me. -I said I am not allowed to dance. -No, you will show me! For my sake. You are very stubborn. Oh, the Ganges! Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! Hail the Ganges River! Hail the Ganges River! Hail the Ganges River! Hail the Ganges River! Hail the Ganges River! Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! -Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! -Oh, the Ganges! Oh, the Ganges! Oh, the Ganges! -Oh, the Ganges! -Hail the Ganges River! Noor, are your dead? Open the door. Mom, Pari is troubling me. Pari, don't trouble her. Finish your homework, then I will serve lunch. Shall I feed you some more? I don't want to eat lentils, I want to eat okra. I will make okra for you tomorrow. Yes, yes, feed them. You have put an end to my lineage. Now, sell this house to feed them. Hey, girl. Come here. Yes, you! I am calling you only. Come here. Do you want money? Very good, come quickly. What a target! It fell right on her head. How did this happen? I don't know where Chintu is. Every time he would come back, but he hasn't returned this time. How did your hair get so dirty? I wait for him every day even after the prayers end. But he doesn't come. Who did this? That truck driver spat. He does this always. Bring your head a little forward. Take care of your dress, tuck it behind. But how did this happen? Didn't you stop him? He sits high up in his truck. Don't you say anything to him? No, what can I say. Such mannerless people! Gross! Spitting on a child. Oh, God! What do these people gain by doing such things? Chhoti, you will come across such people several times in your life. People who want to put you down, defeat you and suppress you. Never be afraid and never back down. Did you understand? They call you an untouchable, right? You rise so high... scale such heights that these people cannot even touch you! Right? I hope you understood what I said. Come, the hair are almost dry now. You get delicious porridge at the Annapurna temple. I will get it for you. Look there, that kite is flying so high! One day, I will also fly away like this kite. Far, far away. Only if I let you go. You can't do anything. Everyone has to go one day, that's the rule. Let others go, they are not my family. You are my family. I will not let you go anywhere. Let me go for now. If I am late, they will not let me enter the Ashram. Where will I stay then? Come now. Look, how unevenly I made your braids! I will make them again for you. With us around, don't even dare to get close to our boss' house. You will to go to my house? Will you? Will you? Tell me. You will go to my house? -Will you? -Yes, I will go. I will go to every lane, every neighborhood. I will tell the whole world that... Raja Raghuvanshi acts very manly, but does it with a eunuch. He forces himself on one and that too for free. What if I shoot you and push Chhoti into flesh trade? Tell me? Should I push her into flesh trade? Tell me! Hey, girl, come here. Come here. Come here. -What's the matter? -Come here. Have you gone mad? -What happened? -You know what happened? No. That truck driver was chewing betel leaf like this. I threw dung on him. Right on his face! Where is it gone? Where is the hole? How did the mosquito enter last night? It was stinging so sharply. Be grateful that I haven't told anyone in the Ashram yet. Had I done so, you would have been thrown out! Here is the hole. Darn! Oh, God. Useless... Oh my dear God. Why are you doing all this unnecessary work? Come on. Look, there is hole in the mosquito net. Stitch it up. Else the mosquitoes will get in and bite me again. Oh, dear Goddess. I've been looking for you for the past two days and you are sitting here. What happened to you? I had a fall at a dance show. You fell while dancing? Why? What happened? Why don't you come home at night? I get scared alone. Chhoti, you go. I will surely come home tonight. But you stay away from Raja and his goons. Please come tonight. Boo! Will you come with me to a special place? Please come. Please, come along! Where are you taking me? Please come with me. Come. Where are your slippers? Right there. -Go wear them. -Okay. Come. Come, Noor, don't be scared. Come. Sit down. Brother... Yes. How many samosas in one plate? Two. Give me two! Do you eat the potato filling of the samosa ? I only eat the crispy crust. Chintu eats the potato filling. I love to eat the crust with the red chutney. You always carry this book with you. What is so special about it? It has Tagore's poems. My grandfather gave it to me. I always keep it under the holy basil plant. Is Tagore your grandfather? No, Tagore was a great poet. My grandfather used to say that the Ganges River flows towards Tagore's house to listen to his poems. Read them out to me. I don't know to read. Your grandfather didn't teach you to read? No, he wanted to. The country had just gained independence then. My grandfather would say that for the country to progress, it is imperative that we educate our daughters. But my family was against it. They wanted me to do household chores. Then they got me married off and I went to my husband's home. Have I told you that Chintu had also promised to send me to school? Boss! I've been living in Banaras for four years. I don't want to become impious by serving them. Switch off the fan! Don't know where they come from to enjoy the cool air for free. Let's go. Let him get the samosa. I told you, let's go. Get lost! Don't come back again! You were lying. Nothing will ever change. We are untouchables and will remain untouchables! We are dogs and will remain dogs! You shouldn't talk like that, my dear. Do you know, when I was a young girl, my grandfather had brought me to the riverbank for the first time. That day, it suddenly became dark even during the day! A small moon eclipsed such a big sun! The sun wins every day. But the moon too has its day! I am Chhoti, I am not the moon. When you join your hands, the lines form a crescent moon! From today, one half is yours... and the other half is mine. Fifty kilograms of rice in 15 days. Not even a kilogram of rice is left. They eat so much. They are all becoming fat. -Who eats so much! -Asha. Is it very difficult to read and write? Not for me. Will you teach me to read and write? What? Love letters? I don't have the time. Go and learn from someone else. 20 kg or 5 kg.... Look, she is taking a packet of colors for the widow. Hello, where are you going? Do you know what that widow is saying behind your back? She says you are all dogs! You are untouchables! I heard you stole nail polish for her. You even took her out for samosas with the stolen money. She only told me all this. She ran away! She stole nail polish? Yes! These are children from the riverbank. You wouldn't know if they stole your underpants from inside your pants! Then what is a nail polish! Hey. I want to show you something. I don't want to see anything. Why? What's the matter, Chhoti? I don't want to talk to anyone. Why? I don't want to be friends with anyone. What happened? Chhoti. Why did you call me moon? What if I would have believed you? I will never meet you again. Go, sit there! In spite of our warnings, this bitch went to your house again. Not only did she go there, she even told them everything. She even told your wife that you are chasing Chhoti. She has become so bold that she has called a journalist from Delhi. Sir, if we don't finish her now, then we will be finished. I had warned you. As long as you bow to me... you will stay alive. Understood? You will tell the world? You will tell the world? I am Raja! Raja, the king! The court here is mine! And the verdict is also mine! Get it? Motherfucker! Chhoti! Anarkali! Anarkali! -Catch that scamp! -Let's catch her! Hey, Aunty. Did you hear the news? Anarkali was murdered! Do you know who killed her? Your Chhoti and her friends. They killed her for money. Didn't I warn you about these children from the riverbank? The day after tomorrow is Holi. Be careful she doesn't splash color on your white saree. Chhoti! What are you doing here? Come, get up, my dear. I was searching for you all over the place. Come on. Come out. Nothing will happen. I am here with you. Come, sit here. I searched for you everywhere. -Killed Anarkali! -Wait. Water first. Drink water first. Drink it. Open your mouth. Raja threw Anarkali from the top! He killed her and now he will kill me. Shh. You don't know anything. Keep quiet, absolutely quiet. Don't say a word to anyone. Quiet. Don't say anything to anybody. No, no, stop crying. Everything will be fine. Shh... come. -Come, come quickly. -Are you Noor? And is she Chhoti? I am Rekha Saxena, a journalist from Delhi. I have come here to write a story about police corruption. I have come here to write a story about police corruption. My sources tell me that the cops are involved in Anarkali's murder. And they are framing Chhoti. Isn't it true? Tell me? Don't talk to her, please leave. Outsiders are not allowed in the Ashram. Please try to understand me. -I can save her. -Let's go. Tell me, child. Raja killed Anarkali, didn't he? Tell me. Come on. Don't cry. Sit here. Sorry. Sorry. Look, what I have made for you. Look at this. It's a dress. I have also stitched a pocket in it. It's nice, isn't it? It's okay, my dear. We will leave this city tonight. But where will we go? I have never crossed the Ganges till date. Where will we go? Can we go to Tagore's house? What? Let's go to Tagore's house. Kolkata! All right. We will go to Kolkata. We shall go to Kolkata. I'll get some water for you. Over there, I will earn by stitching clothes and get you educated. Drink water. I will get you highly educated. Come on, drink water. Can we take Chintu with us? We will take Chintu with us as well. You haven't eaten anything for past two days, have you? I'll get you something to eat. Okay? Drink the water. And then go and hide over there. Open the door when I call for you. I'll be right back. Then, can I call you "Ma"? Chhoti! -Chhoti. -Noor! Come on! Noor! Noor! Chhoti, run! Noor! Noor! Noor! Chhoti! How many times have I said that outsiders are not allowed in the Ashram? But some people just don't listen. Chhoti... Chhoti. Look... look at her nail polish. If you liked dressing up so much, then you should have got married again. Come. Come, bitch. Has the police come to the Ashram ever before? They came here because of this wretch! -Chhoti! -Come on! -Noor! -Chhoti! Noor! Bahadur, she is not just any other girl. She's trouble! If we leave her, she will paint the whole of Banaras. Don't know what the police will do with that little girl. Chhoti... There is only one solution to this. Noor! -Sir, she will drown! -Keep quiet! -Sir, pull the rope! This is not right. -Quiet! Don't interfere in senior's work. -She is just a child! -Idiot, sit there! Trying to show how honest you are! If the journalist Rekha Saxena from Delhi asks, we will say she drowned while escaping. Oh, the Ganges! Oh, the Ganges! Today, Mother Ganges has come here herself? Sir, no. She did not drown despite being under water for half an hour. She has blessings of Mother Ganges. If anyone touches her, we all will be burnt to ashes. If we spare her, we will not be spared. And her journalist "Mother" has also come from Delhi. She will embarrass me in the whole of Banaras. What the hell are you waiting for? Lock her in the men's cell! -Yes, sir. -But, sir... Stand here only! You have made us chase you for too long. Now rot in jail! Sir, he has been troubling us for a while. He is insisting that we release Chhoti. Go there! So gambler, you want to become an inspector for Chhoti? You were released yesterday after four months, you're back here again? Do you want to rot in the prison for your entire life? And you want me to get into trouble because of Chhoti? You want to save Chhoti? You want to save Chhoti? Look at him, he is scaring me! Rascal! Sir, you are amazing! Where is Chhoti? Madam? -Ashok ji. -Yes, sir. Get some sweets for madam. I'll get it right away. -Hurry up! -Where is Chhoti? Chhoti? We are also searching for her. -Do you know where she is? -Stop talking nonsense! You don't know who I am! I know who you are, madam, that's why I ordered for sweets. Or else, I don't even offer poison for free. I will call people in Delhi and get you suspended. Look, madam, this is a police station, not your TV channel. We act only on written orders, not just talks. Go and get the papers. I will not spare you. Then catch me. But not now, I have oil on me. It's slippery. You don't have any idea what I can do. And what I will do! Yes, yes, I understood. Come on, start the massage. By the way, it's Holi tomorrow. I'm having a prayer ceremony to bless me with a son! Why don't you join us, it might just happen! Raja, prayers won't help you. Investigations about Anarkali's murder have begun. And I will definitely save Chhoti. Leave, or do you also want a massage? Hey. Shh. Chhoti... Noor is no more. Some women in the Ashram pushed her from the balcony yesterday. I have unlocked all the rear doors. Lord Rama is the ultimate truth! Lord Rama is the ultimate truth! Lord Rama is the ultimate truth! Lord Rama is the ultimate truth! Lord Rama is the ultimate truth! Wake up! Chhoti has escaped! Ashok ji, Chhoti has escaped. Hail the Ganges River! Hail the Ganges River! No, no, whatever you say, this Holi, I will splash color on you. This is my promise to you. Sir, Chhoti has escaped! Hurry up, get my uniform! It's a bad omen to leave in the middle of prayers. You can't handle a small girl, you bloody eunuchs! When I find her, I will shoot her! Give my shirt. Give the belt. What are you waiting for? Run! She will definitely go to Noor's funeral. Let's go there. What are you waiting for? Run! Raja! Do you know why I never took a bath in Lolark Kund? I didn't want to give birth to another Raja! I will deal with you when I'm back. You will never see us again. I will be back. Salutations to the Mother Goddess Hail to the power of women More strength to her More strength to her Bow to her Hey, move all these things. Hey girl, remove these things. Mind your language! You are talking to Noor Saxena. Senior Advocate, Supreme Court. Don't teach us manners. Get it? You are disrupting the peace in the city. Absolutely not. We are here only to celebrate Holi. To celebrate Holi! These widows are going to play with colors? -Yes. -Wow! Wonderful! Today, they will play with colors... tomorrow, they will adorn themselves. Then they will get married as well. You cannot play with colors here, madam. This is a tradition of Banaras that widows cannot celebrate Holi. You can keep your traditions to yourself. -Madam, here-- -Don’t you dare touch me again! You are committing two crimes here! First: You are violating the orders of the Honorable Supreme Court. Second: Under section 46, class 4, criminal procedure court, being a male officer, you cannot touch a female! Sir, you cannot touch her. -Let me see how you will play Holi. -Yes, you can! They are going to play Holi! I promise to become a police officer just to protect you. Swear by the Ganges River. What? Nothing has happened. Let's go. Chhoti, always remember this one poem by Tagore. 'Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high' Hey Chhoti, as promised I'm back before the prayers are over. Here are 300 rupees. Want to start school from tomorrow?
