You're painting really fast. Not that fast. I don't want to make mistakes. My brush is too thick, it?s so difficult to paint both sides. How many have you painted so far? About 30. How many did you paint yesterday? They are so big. I did only 100. I didn?t finish even though I stayed until the evening. Your parents are going back home in June, right? Not sure. I think so. It?s almost May already. Are you also going back? Probably not. Will you go home? I will go for the Chinese New Year. There are so many dented balls. I have several here. This ball is also dented. We have to deliver, please hurry up. That one is dented, right? No, just chipped paint. It's not chipped, it's dented. Not a big problem, that ball is OK. This is definitely paint peeling off! But this is not peeling paint. It's no big deal. Dented like this? It's not a lot. I guess no one will see it, unless they really stare. Prepare 18 packages for them. Yes, I think 18 packages will be enough. Manager: "I didn't expect so many orders for the domestic market. I'm not sure how to plan the production this season. I didn't know that anyone celebrates Christmas in China." Factory owner: "Domestic market can wait until the end of the production season. The last international orders will ship in October." Huang Guan is taking a day off tomorrow because his wife is sick. Huang Guan? Yes, they are going to the hospital. Xiao Wang will prepare the materials. So we stop two machines? No, just one. - Oh, OK. And how many packages should we produce? Only a fraction must be delivered before the end of this month. And the delivery to Duan Yuli is for early tomorrow. They want to receive it before 10am, so we should start at 7 or 8. OK, Duan Yuli. The demand for Christmas balls is huge. Workers are under a lot of pressure. And so are we. More orders are coming, we don't have much time. Workers will have to work really fast. But not risk their health. - Of course. We mustn't push them too hard. What is this? Are there balls missing from this box? Turn that box the other way. Is this package done? Yes. All done. Several colours. And the ratio of different colours? Of course, it's done properly. - Have you counted them? One, two, three, four... Yes, the ratio seems to be correct. One, two, three, four, five, six... Just close the box. Close it and push it away. Are you finished? Yes, all done. You are cleaning up the table? I'm waiting for your order. I'll do whatever you ask. Will you give me something easy to do? Ask the big boss. It doesn't work that way. How can I ask him? Why don't you like packaging balls? Aren't they beautiful? It's annoying to pack these shitty balls every day. It must be done by someone. We have to coordinate. I'm so angry. Of course, you feel tired... I am not tired, I'm angry. Everybody feels the same here. Who isn't tired? Do we need cabbage? That cabbage is not good, don't buy it. How about a bitter melon? What do we need for the side dish? Two. Two pieces are enough. Don't pick the old ones. These at the bottom. These are good. The small ones are tender and delicious. Pick from the bottom. OK. Let's go. Let's eat, let's eat. Stop with the phone. Swirl? You should have told me earlier, I dismantled the mould. Yes, dismantled already. I'm in a hurry to produce for Korea. Your delivery might be a little late. For the candy shape also. Time is tight. Is it OK? OK. Let's not forget the missing pieces. Bye. Eat, eat. 56 ethnic groups are one family. Just like blooming flowers in a garden. Red pomegranate seeds stick to each other. No single one can leave others aside. Our mother is China. 56 ethnic groups are one family. Just like blooming flowers in a garden. Red pomegranate seeds stick to each other. No single one can live apart from others. Our mother is China. 56 ethnic groups are one family. Just like blooming flowers in a garden. Red pomegranate seeds stick to each other. No single one can leave others aside. Our mother is China. China! Don't sigh in despair all day. "I am too tired." "I am too angry to talk." Everyone's tired, OK? I don't mean to piss you off. I'm angry because you don't eat. - I am not hungry. You can talk politely. Yesterday, you were rude with the cook. I don't want to talk. - You don't want to talk? Let us know if something bothers you. You never talk. Everybody sees that something is wrong. Work here two more years. Save some money. Then you can work in our shop. That's a cool job. Unless you prefer to stay in the factory with me? Do you want to work with Meng Haoran in the shop? What do you think? We must work hard for two more years until our factory is successful. You will have your wish come true to become rich. You can't have your wishes fulfilled without money. I think I will be too old when I become rich. What? I will be too old by then. Old? But if you do nothing you'll have nothing. Don't dream. You have to work. Fantasy is useless. Empty talk is useless, too. Dare to think, and dare to do it. It's hard, but you'll get used to it. Just sitting there, thinking, nothing can happen. Who's doing nothing? I am doing something, am I not? Be positive when you go to work. Look at your bitter face. There is no energy in it. But I should be serious when I work, right? Or should I smile all day long? You attack me if I smile and laugh. And now you blame me for not smiling. You misunderstand everything. Who is to blame for that? You can smile and keep working, too. Don't stop working when you talk. You will feel less tired if you are positive. And you'll be more tired if you keep a bitter face. Once, we started talking, and auntie told us to stop at once. Did she say that your father was coming? She wants us to be serious. "Don't talk, work!" "Faster, faster!" I'm almost finished. I ate too much today. These days are hot. It makes people tired. It will be better when it gets cooler. I'm done. Want some water? - No, I already had some. You can put water on the fan, it'll be cooler. Move that, you will have more space. Or move the machine over there. This frame is much lighter. Have you done this before? Is this the original length? Let me see... Maybe she should weld at this point. You must weld higher up on this frame. Where did you weld? We always weld at this point. But I have changed the frame! It's a new one. You didn't notice? Just try one, you'll see. - But last time... It's not like the last time. They are all smaller. But look at those. They are all changed. There are these in the front, and those at the back. It was already changed last time! Have you not been here for a whole year? I tried and it fits. It fits? Just compare them, you'll see. This semicircle is too long. Fuck, I know the last batch was OK. But this time it's too long. Because of the machine? Fuck. Now you must weld like this. I'll show you. This is a great new song, listen. It froze. It froze. It's stuck. I don't know which part he sang. It's not that good. Why don't you learn some computer skills? That's worth learning. Some games, some softwares. I know computers without having to learn. You do? I do. I play computer games every day. I'm sure there is something to learn even if you play computer every day. Yes. I want to buy fruit. How much are the apples? I don't need apples. Weigh this. You can pay with Wechat. 11 Yuan. Can this be cheaper? - It cannot. Girl: "I am leaving Yiwu. I will look for a job in Chengdu. I can't work in the same factory with him." Her co-worker: "It's a long distance. If you leave Yiwu, you will never get back together again. There are so many factories in Yiwu." If you keep asking me to get back with him, I won't come home anymore. Whatever. We already broke up, I don't care about him anymore. He wasn't very nice. He was going too far. I wouldn't blame him if it wasn't his fault. Now it's too late, anyway. I'm too busy to talk to him. And he can't bear it. How can you ask that? I'm your daughter and you keep blaming me. It wasn't like that. It wasn't my fault. I didn't want to confront him. His mother is such a tiger, it's good we broke up. We even talked about marriage. But then it was over. These people in the factory... I don't care what they think. I'm hanging up. Let's talk later, bye. Please sign. You can count it. Liang Zhonghua! Sign here. Count it. Make sure it's correct. Xiang Zhongjiang! Sign here. Here? Lee Mapeng. Come. Don't forget to count it, OK? So how's the girlfriend situation? How are you and your girlfriend doing? It's Huang Ying, right? It is. Is she good to you? We broke up. We separated last month. Why? We have different temperaments. And also for some other reasons. And you? I had a girl, but... She cheated on me. Cheated? There are a lot of cheaters these days. You know, I am too honest. One shouldn't be too honest. You mustn't be deceitful. You're wrong, you have to be shifty. Especially in this society. How's that? If you are honest... Honest people get cheated. You have to know that. You're funny. You're an easy target for cheaters. They prefer not to mess with someone like me. You're right, actually. Next time, pay attention. Being honest to a girl is useless. I don't understand anything. What do you mean? You have to know these things. Walk with me on the streets of Chengdu. Stay till all the lights are out. Walk with me on the streets of Chengdu. Stay till all the lights are out. You'll grab my sleeve, I'll put my hands in my pockets. Walk till the end of the Yulin road. Sit in front of a small bar. Drink! Cheers! How do I make you understand? This heart is always with yours. Following you, I?d go anywhere. Watching the winter fireworks together. If you weren?t so lonely or fragile, maybe I wouldn?t miss you so much. Will you tell me about your sadness? Will you think of me tonight? Even if there's no promise, no result, if you love truly, the flower will grow. Deep in your heart, I'm a guardian. Promise you shall live more happily. I'll do anything just to be with you. Let me protect you my whole life. For the sweetness of tomorrow, let's keep our first commitment. Please trust me, I'm waiting at the port of love. I'll do anything just to be with you. Let me be with you my whole life. You are my one and only, my heart will never change. I won't let you wait until the end of the flower season. Husband: "The construction of the new factory is almost completed. We can soon begin the Christmas ball production." Wife: "I can't help with the business any longer. I decided to stay at home with kids until Duoduo finishes first grade." How about this? Can you write these? Yes. Let's review then. We need to review. Why do we need to review? You learn, then you need to review to have a deeper understanding. Then you can really remember these words, OK? I remembered. I remember every day. Let's start reviewing the language book. After Pinyin 2, we are done. Can you read this? I'll point one out. What is this? Hurry up. Concentrate. Shi, shi, shi, shi. Xiang ri kui (Sunflower). Ri, ri, ri. I like writing. Zi, zi, zi. Xiao Ci Wei (Little hedgehog). Zi, zi, zi. Is it - zi, zi, zi? Little hedgehog. Ci, Ci, Ci. Chun can Tu Si (Silkworm spins silk). Si, Si, Si. You're slouching again. Read this part again. It's all worksheets and lesson reviews. This is finished. - There is still all this. You didn't listen carefully in class. Continue, read these again. Yuan liang (Forgive). Yuan, yuan, yuan. What - forgive? See what you drew here? Isn't that the moon? It's the moon, it's round, so it's Yuan yue (Round moon). Yuan yue. Yue, yue, yue. I don't wanna read! The teacher said that he is very smart, but he doesn't take his classes seriously. But he can still answer whatever the teacher asks. This is an important age for him, the foundation for the rest of his life. Without a good foundation, it won't matter how much money we earn. There is no alternative. - We'll see how it goes. When I was a child, I listened to my father. He wanted me to be a doctor or a teacher. It was quite interesting when I began studying. But when we came to the hospital for the internship, I felt that doctors have a lot of restrictions. And I don't like to be restrained. The more I feel restrained, the more I want to resist. I wasn't happy as a doctor, then again, had I ended up teaching... Every occupation has both a sense of accomplishment and of unhappiness. It's always conflicting. This feeling made me uncomfortable. I wasn't happy. What are you thinking about? Sometimes I have regrets, but there was no other way. My hand was injured at the time, so I had to give up being a doctor. I never regret giving up medicine. I liked it very much. Maybe it's fate. As if I wasn't meant to be a doctor. Medicine became so annoying to me after that internship year. I felt I hated the entire profession. This is my idea. There are three more floors, and our office will be here on this floor... You can see the two mountains, and there's the new road, it's such a good location for the factory. When we went to do business, even though we had financial problems, the business still felt good. Like running this company... We work hard, but we are free. The white fabric will come on the 5th, is that OK? The 5th? What day is today? 26th? We only have two rolls of white fabric left. Three days and we're done. I'll tell them to hurry up. Or we can work with the red fabric. Maybe we can call Wenzhou. I will ask for delivery from Wenzhou. Ask them to send sample fabric first. We don't want that old fabric. - You want samples? It is risky otherwise. The last time it was rotten. These white pieces are way too narrow. You see, you have to make that wider. Like this. OK? And be sure to meet your quota. Let me teach you how to do the hat brim. Give me that piece. Now, look! It needs to be done like this. Turn this way, then pull it out. Like that. Use this tool. Much better today, now you get it. Much better than yesterday. How about we employ more temporary workers? I can carry it by myself. - Auntie, don't bother. Done. OK. Do we know how many kilos they weigh now? About 8 kilos. What is the price of pork? About 25 Yuan? The price of porcupine meat is now more than 140. So one porcupine can sell for 1200 Yuan. These two are old ones? They gave birth to 4 babies last year. These two? Yes, these two. Those in the corner? There are no babies this year. What can you do. Normally they have two babies every year. Very low yield, this year. Maybe not enough nutrition. This year we will invite Lao Yu and the clients from online shops. But we must invite our butcher first. We won't be so busy after Christmas. We could take some time off. Mr. Ye and Lao Yu can't be invited together. No, they can not. We need to do the slaughtering three times. Why three times? Because of Ye Yang Bin and Hao Bei. Not sure if they can come together. Maybe, if they are not too busy. If they do, ask your mother to make some tofu. We still need one porcupine per table. - We'll have vegetables. One for each table, trust me. Wife: "Our clients accepted the invitation for dinner. They will all come together, right after the Western New Year." Husband: "I can never remember what is celebrated on Western New Year, and what is celebrated on Christmas." When do your parents return? They will return in a week. In a week? - Yes. And your sister is in school? She usually comes only for the holidays. During the winter holidays? And Chinese New Year, whenever she is free. I consider this to be my home now. Nobody lives in our hometown anymore, except my grandpa. Since my younger sister doesn't know how to take care of herself, and my grandpa is too old to look after her, she just comes here. That's good, when the whole family is together. I have a friend who told me: Boss Zhou, I envy you. No matter if you earn more money or not, you have your family together. This friend is much richer than me. Her daughter is studying abroad, her husband has a business abroad, she's all alone. She told me that the happiest thing is when the family is together. Rich or poor. Why doesn't she go abroad to her family? Because she has a huge business here. She has two shops at the center. She has billions in assets. It was the last year or the year before... She has bought three cars. This year she changed them all. I was teasing her to sell me one of her BMWs for a very low price. She said she will keep all of them. Now she has six cars. You also have a big sister? - Yes, four daughters in our family. I've never seen her. She doesn?t come often. Last time she came to Yiwu, she only stayed for a few days. She's busy, working. She has a job? She started to work two years ago. So you don't see her a lot? Only during the Chinese New Year. Does she call you often? We video call, from time to time. Unlike in the old days, communication is simple and convenient. We call each other often, especially during the holidays. When she works she is not available. Daughter: "I miss my younger sister. When will she come to Yiwu?" Mother: "During the school holiday. She now has her singing exams." Go get me a box. Bring the box to mommy. What box? - An empty box. Thank you. - It is empty. This is child abuse. Child abuse. Chinese are like this. Poor families have diligent children. They all work since early childhood. It's a Chinese tradition. I can?t resist, especially at night. I can't even breathe. I want to run to you immediately. And tell you loudly. I will do it. I will do it for you. I will do it for you. Even if I forget my name. Just for one more second in your arms. The whole world can disappear. I will do it for you. I will do it for you. I will do it for you, I will drift away with you. As long as you love me back, I'll do anything for you. Half of it is already packed. 450 packages must be finished this evening. 450 packages. We can do it after dancing. The farms far away. That's where my father lives. Those white felt rooms. That's where my mother gave birth to me. Ah, my hometown. My father who works so hard. He fought for his children all his life. You are the sun of our heart. Ah, my hometown. My mother who is so kind. She worked for our family so hard. You are the moon of our heart. Hello! Do you miss us? That makes me sad. I miss you, in a manner of speaking. You don't miss us at all. Don't say something like that. Do you now prefer Yiwu, or our hometown? Of course home is better. Will you return to Yiwu? It depends. You must behave if you want to stay at home. Understand? Yes, I do. Be good. Do something. Don't be lazy. You should go and find a job. Yes, OK. We'll be back home in a month. Just wait for us, and be good. OK. Help the family, do some house work. Yes. The weather is getting cold now. Only in the morning and the evening. Yes, in the morning and evening. Autumn is good. Chinese New Year is near now. Yes. Did I upset you? No. You should go to sleep after you finish eating. Bye, bye. - Bye, bye! You were in a fight? Yes. Why did you fight? I was drunk, I didn't like the guy. So we fought. He is from your village, right? We often fight with each other. Why did you fight? Just because you were drunk? I was drunk and... I didn't like what he said, so we fought. Don't be so nice to me, I get shy. You quit your job now? I don't want to work like that, there's no future there. There's no future? I won't work like that anymore. So you want to start your own business? Yes. What is your plan? I will open a shop. - What? Open a shop. A shop? Open a shop! - Oh, a shop... What kind of a shop? Did you come up with the plan? I will open a shop for milk tea. That sounds good. You're right, there is no future in working like this. We just follow orders. I don't want to work like this either. Hello, how are you! - Hello, hello! I apologize for the inconvenience. Don't mention it. Come I'll show you. It's very light. - Yes, it's plastic. Christmas balls? - Yes, Christmas balls. Is Duoduo back from school? Where is Chenchen? The shipping for the French client is sorted out. I solved the problem. - That's good, that's good. I can come home today. Where are you now? I'm still at the port. Pick me up tonight at 8. When is your train? 4:30pm. When does it arrive? 8pm. OK, no problem. - OK then. I will come to pick you up. - OK. You take care. - I will, bye, bye. During the reign of the emperor, there was a monster called Nian (Year). It swallowed animals and harmed humans. Especially young children. Its attacks were ferocious. The villagers and dogs couldn't oppose him. The villagers asked the lion for help. The lion bravely charged towards Nian, and seriously injured it. Nian (Year) was finally defeated. But, it swore to come back for revenge. One year later, Nian came again. There was no lion to protect them, so people drew images of lion on paper. And made costumes imitating the lion. Two brave villagers put on the costumes, and climbed into the cave where Nian lived. They snuck up to it, and jumped on it, roaring like a lion. And finally they drove Nian (Year) away. Since then, the lion dance has become annual tradition for the Chinese New Year. To scare ghosts away, and to bring good luck and happiness. Do you understand? Do you think it?s a good story? Is it the same story your teacher told you? Or different? How did the teacher tell it? Teacher said Nian (Year) lived on a mountain. It was lonely and never played with others. It felt very angry when snows came, and it scared other lonely people. Different version, but mostly the same, right? People were lighting firecrackers, once their stomachs were full. There were firecrackers everywhere. Nian was afraid to come out anymore. Oh, so two versions. Every year, on that day, people celebrate New Year. Nian was lonely in a very tall house. OK, now you're starting all over again. Mommy understands now. There are two versions. My story is a bit different from yours. Boss?s daughter: "Father says, if we work hard, everyone can make money. He says there are several hundred Christmas factories in Yiwu, but we still don?t produce enough to satisfy the demand from our Western clients. Does that make sense?" Her cousin: "Why do you ask me? I also didn't like school when I was young. Now I know better, but it?s too late. Reading gives me headache. A headache? Yes. A headache. Everybody should go to school. Not me. I hate it. I can't even stay awake during math classes. Poor people desperately want to go to school. So many poor people want to go to school, but they cannot. All my classmates quit school. Which classmates? The one who was sitting next to me. And all my old friends. And even those who were good at school. That's their business. You should mind your own business. I don't want to go either. If you don?t... You'll be like me and your father. Uneducated. That's not good for you. I don't care. Missing someone is a mysterious feeling. It comes silently, and sinks in your heart. The loneliness swallows you. I can?t resist, especially at night. I can't even breathe. I want to run to you immediately. And tell you loudly. I will do it. I will do it for you. I will do it for you, even if I forget my name. Just for one more second in your arms. The whole world can disappear. I will do it for you. I will do it for you. I will do it for you, I will drift away with you. As long as you love me back, I'll do anything for you. So much white paint. I can't clean it. Go wash inside. I want to stay here. Look! What a character! Oh, he's tall. This cloth is so dirty. Keep washing it. So dirty. I can't remove this. Oh, I?m so tired. Merry Christmas, Yiwu
