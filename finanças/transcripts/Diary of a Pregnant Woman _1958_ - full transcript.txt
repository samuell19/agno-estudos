Diary of a pregnant woman. Behind the Pantheon. Between two churches. There is a street which has a short name... la Mouffe. L'Op?ra Mouffe, at first sight, at first sound, it's about food. ON LOVERS It's silence, it's a cat. It's an embrace. you're here, you dream away. I'm away. I dream here. ON NATURE It was a beach... bathed in sunlight. ON PREGNANCY The fish is in the egg the bud in the flesh... and the dove in water. SOME OF THEM They were newborn babies. Someone, some other, some of them. Someone, some other, some of them. DEAR BELOVED Alive they're away. Dead they're gone. GREETINGS Mom Walloween. Dad Santa-Claus. The love-child and Valentine's day. We replace bad heads. ON DRUNKENNESS Lover's sleep. Flirts with death. He who drinks sleeps and doesn't eat. ON ANXIETY ON DESIRES In between disgust and desire. In between decay and life.
