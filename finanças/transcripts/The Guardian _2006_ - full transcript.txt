[man] There's a legend of a man who lives beneath the sea. He is a fisher of men. The last hope of all those who have been left behind. Many survivors claim to have felt his gripping hands beneath them, pushing them up to the surface, whispering strength until help could arrive. But this, of course, is only a legend. [man] Help! - [woman yelling] - [man] over here! - [both gasping] - [man] Help! Ma'am, l'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer. l'm here to help you. - Sir. - Here. Stay with your flotation. l'll be back for you. - Don't leave me! - Stay there. [man] Don't you leave me! [whimpering] Basket is outside the cabin, going down. - [pilot] Roger. Copy you. - Boarder, right 30. Boarder, right 15. - [pilot] Right 15. - Hold, hold, hold. Basket is in the water. Swimmer and survivor have the basket. Put your head in first. - [gasping] - Help me. [coughing] Take it up! [man] Easy forward. Let go! - No. - Let go! - Let go, you're drowning her! - [grunting] Help me. Help me, please. [grunts] [woman whimpering] Whoa! Swimmer just popped him in the face. OK, he's putting the man in the basket. Man is in the basket. Taking the load. [screaming] Whoa. Big wave. Get out! Get out! What's wrong with you? Sit there and shut up. [man] Swimmer in sight. Prepare to take the load. I have the ready-for-pickup signal. Swimmer is approaching cabin door. Survivor looks unconscious. Swimmer inside of cabin door. - [coughing, gagging] - Cabin door closing. - [continues coughing] - [radio chatter] [man retching] God, I think you just broke my nose. And you may have killed your wife, sir! Twenty minutes to Kodiak. [man] Roger. He's giving her CPR. [pilot] This is Coast Guard 6096. We have two hypothermic survivors on board. Be there in 20 minutes. Requesting ambulance on scene when we land. [gasping, crying] [man chuckling] Whoa! There we go. - [man] Got her? - We got her! [laughing] [radio chatter] [continues laughing] That a way, baby! - [woman coughing] - There's dead... [exhales] ...and then there's dead. [man] l swear you get better with age. [exhales] [indistinct chatter] [woman] Oh, we're not going home. - Had to hit him, huh? - Yeah. You are not... Stay over there! You stay over there! Don't come near me. Seems like it's always the big ones that crack. Lieutenant. Crew said that she went under. They thought you'd lost her. Lucky guess. Luck my ass. [indistinct radio chatter] l didn't think you were serious. Of course you didn't, Ben. How could you think I was? l'm not a nameless drowning victim. Oh, gee. l'm sorry saving lives doesn't jibe with our social cal... [stammering] That's, um... That's my chair. He's right. Not that chair. Sorry. l was just pointing things out in the living room. They didn't know. l would never take your chair. Pick it up. What's...? lt doesn't have to be messy, Ben. lt's clean, simple for both of us. We don't have kids. Well, what about Friday? What about Friday? We were gonna go with Carl and Bridgette, you know, to that... ...dinner dance thing at the base. [exhales] The base? All you can eat wings? A dart game to settle the tab? That's the date we can't break? - You're right. You're right. - Wow. Look, we'll... We'll go away, all right? Just us. lt's too late, Ben. I don't know what I can say that I haven't said already. It's time for me to rescue myself. [phone ringing] Maybe... Maybe l should be the one to move out. - [machine] You've reached Helen... - [Ben] And Ben. Leave a message. You don't know where anything is in this house. lt's easier this way. [man over machine] Senior Chief, please report to base. [beeps] l can... l can fix this. All right? l... I can... I can fix this. Just... Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do. - [beeping] - [sighs] [beeping continues] Just let me go. - No. No. - Just let me go. [beeping] You should answer that. [man on radio] Ready rescue helo 6096. Swimmer one, return to base. - l don't want to lose her. - Then change. How many times we had this conversation, huh? The only way for you to save it is to give this up and fly a desk. Exactly. She just wants to live. And maybe we can get a hobby. Both of us. Something like fishing. - Fishing? - Yeah. - Guys like us don't fish, Carl. - lt'll work out. Always does. Let me ask you something, seriously. Is it too soon for me to ask her out? - You better... - l guess so. [waves crashing] [man on radio] Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is cargo vessel Sea Queen. We're at 55 degrees, 12 minutes North. 167 degrees, 10 minutes West. We're taking on water. We're abandoning ship. l repeat, we're abandoning ship. - Make sure you and the four men... - [speaking foreign language] Son, look at me. Look at me. You're gonna be OK. Got that? We're gonna be OK. OK. [beeping, electric whirring] [howling, gusting winds] [helicopter blades whirring] [beeping] - Tail rotor de-ice caution light. - Any secondary? No. Circuit breakers are in so it has failed, but we're not building up ice. - How's the fuel? - 40 minutes to bingo. All right, take the stick. - l have the controls. - All right, huddle time. We have a de-ice fail. We're low on fuel. The rulebook says we cut our losses. What do you think, Ben? Well, if we go home... they die, Bill. [pilot] Kodiak, this is Coast Guard 6096. We have a de-ice caution light, but we are pressing on. [man] 609er 6, keep us updated on your status. Get the maintenance chief on the line. l wanna know what he thinks about this. [waves crashing] [man grunting, yelling] [man 1] Computer says winds at 60-85 knots. You're on your own with altitude. [man 2] Roger. Mark. Mark. Right side. Debris in water. - Request to open cabin door. - [man 1] Roger. [man 2] Kodiak Ops, 6096, we're on scene. Heavy debris in the water. Commencing cover search. Mark in known position. l'm going in. They're dead, Ben. Ben, they're dead. We don't know that. There's six PlW's all tied together. No signs of life. - l think we may be too late. - Not our call. They're on scene. They'll make the assessment. Requesting to get wet, sir. l ain't sending you fishing for bodies. Not in this. Well, how about fathers and sons? Flare! We got a live one here, we got a live one. You got five minutes. Then we're hauling your ass back up. [man] This is Coast Guard 6096. We have people in the water. Deploying our swimmer. [man] 609er 6, Kodiak Ops, copy. One's holding the flare. No other movement. [pilot] Roger. - [Carl] Swimmer ready. - Check swimmer. Roger. Checking swimmer. Swimmer's dress-down checklist is complete. Five minutes. [Carl] Swimmer's away. - Swimmer's OK. Clear back and left 40. - Clear back and left. - How we looking on fuel, there? - Two minutes to bingo. I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer here to help you, son. You're gonna be OK. l'm gonna get you in that helicopter. - I have the ready-for-pickup signal. - Roger. Basket is going out of the cabin door. Bingo. We're at bingo. Gotta go. [Carl] Ease it back. Hold. The basket is in the water. We're out of time. We gotta go, Carl. [Carl] Hold position. Steady. Hold. He's putting the survivor in the basket. - [man] It's going crazy. - Yeah, I know. I'm all over the place. Come on, Carl. We gotta go, now! [Carl] Don't have a ready-for-pickup signal. - Carl! Carl! Behind you! - Holy shit! We lost our tail rotor! - [grunting] - Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. [screaming] - We're going down. - Mayday. Mayday. [gasping] - Carl. - I'm here. - Carl. - Ben. Hold on, Carl. Hold on. They'll be coming for us. I've got you. You're OK now. - You're OK. l'm here, Carl. - [gasping, coughing] We're OK. Hang on. I've got you. [Carl] You think they're coming? [Ben] Oh, yeah. They're coming. I want a C-130 over that crash site now. - Krauss, start the mishap checklist. - Aye, captain. - EPlRB hit on Randall's suit. - Launch ready helo, swimmer provide. We have a C-130 coming off from KCAW at two. - It's low on fuel. - I don't care. Cut an engine. I want him to know he's not alone. Listen. [airplane engine whirring] You hear that? Hold on, Carl. Here we go. I've got you. What's the ETA on the backup helo? En route to Cold Bay. Should be on scene three, four hours. Make it three. - [sighs] - [vomiting, coughing] Jesus, how much more of that stuff do you think I got in me? - You feel that? - [gasping] - You feel that? - [groaning] Yeah. lt means you're alive. l'm not gonna let go. - Don't you! - I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna. [shivering, groaning] [helicopter blades whirring] Serious fractures like in the C-spinal should cause paralysis. Mostly what we see is old fractures in the arms, also in the leg. But nothing acute, nothing new. [indistinct chatter] We've been friends a long time, haven't we? I've always been good to you, haven't I? Didn't promote you to a desk when you turned 40 like everybody else. - That's right. - So now l need you to listen to me. OK. There's an instructor opening at "A" School in... - No. The answer is no. - You just said you'd listen. - Sit down. - l'm not interested, captain. Well, it's no longer a request, Senior Chief. Sit down. You're serious? You have two choices. Sign the papers today and you can live as a civilian here in Kodiak if that's what you want. Or take that "A" School opening I'm offering you. - [scoffs] - I've already spoken to command there. lt will be your class. You will be in charge. You can take the time to work your way back into shape. - l am in shape. - Goddamn it. That's not what l'm talking about. [exhales] All I'm asking is that you go down there for a few months. You work with the kids, you recharge, you... ...download that epic résumé where it's gonna do some good. You can't always be the one in the water, Ben. You'll know when you're ready to come back. - [marching cadence] - [whistle blowing] You people got 15 seconds to get off this bus! - [man 1] Move! Move, let's go! - [man 2] Get off the bus! [indistinct yelling] [electronic whirring] [man] Put your white books in your red bags. Let's get that squared away now. Put those books away. Put down your bags. Fall out to the rear. Follow two flights and patter up the hall. The rest of you, pick a bunk. Put on your ODU's. You started with 15 minutes. You are now down to 12. Move! Move, move, move, move! - Short time, short time. - One, two... - Over here. - [man] Hurry up, move it out. - Top. - All right. [man] Find your rack. Quit wasting my time. Hey. Hey. That's my stuff, man. Hey. That's his bunk. You two a couple? lt's OK... l like the top better anyway. [man] Out of the 39,000 men and women who make up the US Coast Guard, - There are only 280 rescue swimmers. - Let's go! Let's go! This is because we are the Coast Guard's elite. We are the best of the best. When storms shut down entire ports, we go out. When hurricanes ground the United States Navy, we go out. When the Holy Lord Himself reaches down from heaven and destroys His good work with winds that rip houses off the ground, we go out. And the attrition rate at this school is well over 50 percent. So if by some miracle you actually have what it takes to become one of us, then, you get to live a life of meager pay with the distinct possibility of dying slow, cold and alone somewhere in the vast sea. However, you also get the chance to save lives. And there is no greater calling in the world than that. So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Welcome to "A" School. Are there any questions? Captain, Airman Fischer. l just have one question. That guy who holds all them records, is he still alive? - Why do you ask? - I thought you ought to let him know - l'm about to knock his name off. - Really? Why don't you let him know yourself? He's standing right behind you in the back of the room. Class, turn around and greet Senior Chief Ben Randall. Senior Chief Randall will be your lead instructor for the next 18 weeks. Senior Chief Randall is one of the most decorated rescue swimmers in the history of the United States Coast Guard. Ben, would you care to address the class? No, l think there's been enough talk for one day. Chief Skinner, they're all yours. - Attention on deck! - Carry on. Aye, captain. PT test begins at 0700 tomorrow. Class dismissed. File through the front door. First row followed by the second. - Frank. - [sighs] - When God rips houses off the ground? - [chuckling] l was rolling. l didn't mean to put you on the spot up there. [Skinner] Let's move. I was real sorry to hear about your crew. Come on. I'll show you around. So l hear you're staying in a single? Yeah. Helen's got some family business she's gotta take care of up there. [man] Mayday, mayday, mayday. We are on fire! We are on fire! [gasping] [alarm beeping] - [whistle blowing outside] - [man] Let's go! - Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Get it, get it, get it. Let's move it now! Let's move it out! Work as a team! Work as a team! - [indistinct shouting] - Hurry up! - Two lines. - Two lines. Let's go. [chattering continues] [man shouting] Where's my class leader? [sighs] [man shouting] Turn around! Turn around. The only authorized command to get you back up on your feet is "pop tall." [all] Yes, Petty Officer Hall. - Understand me? - [all] Yes, Petty Officer Hall. Very well. Let's try it. Lean and rest. Pop tall! [out of synch] Ooh-rah. What the hell was that? That was terrible! Let's try that again. Lean and rest! Together as one! [groaning] [grunting] - Twenty-two. - Down. Up. - Twenty-three. - Down. Up. - Twenty-four. - Get that ass down! [all] Twenty-five. That is absolutely horrible! Pop tall. To the lone pine and back! Go! Move your ass! Let's move it! Get it going! [man] Let's go! Let's go! - Bring 'em back. - [man] Circle back. - Let's go. Get back in line! - Let's move! Get back in PT formation. PT formation. PT formation. Lean and rest. Senior Chief on deck. [straining] [marching cadence indistinct] [men chanting] Don't need no land, don't need no trees! [all straining] Mmm-hmm. [straining continues] Pop tall. [all clapping] Ooh-rah! I don't care who you are, where you are from or where you are going. l care about one thing only. That is the future victims you will be asked to save. lf l feel that you will fail them, l will fail you. Understood? [all] Yes, Senior Chief! Hodge. Where are you from, Hodge? I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey, Senior Chief. Hodge is our triple repeat. You plan on making it this time, three-peat? - l hope to, Senior Chief. - Well hope don't float, Hodge. Better learn to swim against the current, not with it. Aye, aye, Senior Chief. Fisch? Fisch, why are you here, Fisch? I'm here to exceed your expectations, Senior Chief. l'm a rescue swimmer at heart. Born, bred and water-fed. Ooh-rah! Wow, l'll bet you practiced that all morning. Fischer is our high school swim champ. He's had scholarships to every lvy League. Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't realize that he was so qualified. I mean, you set records in a pool? That's amazing. l'll bet it was like, what, eight feet deep in the deep end? What if your nose plug didn't work? What if another swimmer had cut into your lane. [stifling laughter] For the love of God, you could have been killed. Schedule says that you will perform a PT test this morning. That will not be necessary. Water is where you've been called to serve... ...water is where you will be tested. [whistle blowing] This will serve in place of your PT end test. This is a go/no-go exercise. You will tread water for one hour. You touch the wall, you fail. You touch the bottom, you fail. You fail, and you go home. Senior, this school operates on a two-challenge rule. You can't throw them out on their first day. If you cannot survive in a warm pool of water, you've no business here. Does this class understand? - [all] Yes, Senior Chief! - Ooh-rah, class 5506. Who here can tell me the rescue swimmer's motto? - So others may live, Senior Chief. - Whoa. I feel safer already. You willing to sacrifice your life so others may live, Goldfish? Yes, I am, Senior Chief. You will have to earn that right. l want all of you to think about that. There is going to come a time when you reach the point of exhaustion. You'll want to give up. The question is... will you? [Skinner] There are three letters that will set you free. D-O-R. Drop on request. Look at that. - A waste of time. - [grunting] - You all right? - Stay up. [gasping] [man] Somebody help him up! [indistinct shouting] [overlapping shouts] [man] Help him up. - Help him out. - Hold him up. [overlapping shouts] Lyons, relax, man. [grunting, panting] You're dismissed. - But l cramped up. - You're gone. [man] Let's go, out of the water. Hurry up, let's go. On your feet. [Ben] First lesson in physics, people. Muscle does not float. Petty Officer Watson, pull them out of the pool. Aye, aye, Senior Chief. Let's go, out of the water. [blows whistle] Hurry up! Let's move, people, hurry up! [man] Class winner, right here. Thought you said you were willing to sacrifice your life for another. I am, Senior Chief. Why didn't you save your team mate when he reached out? [panting] I wasn't aware we were working as a team, Senior Chief. That's the only way we work, swim champ. Aye, aye, Senior Chief. [♪ Ozomatli: Saturday Night] - Asshole. - Come again. You heard me. Hey. Hey. Hey. Ease up. Ease up. - What? Huh? - lt's not worth it. l think there's an opening on my buoy tender. l'll put in a word for you, huh? l'm really gonna miss that guy. Hey, man, what are you doing? You got your bunk back. - Captain. - Ben, come in. You work fast. Lyons? He was one of our top candidates. Sometimes you gotta shoot a hostage. Look, we all know that you're a legend and all, but our program has been proven to work. There's a gap between training and what really happens, Cujo. - Really? - That's right. My intention is to narrow that gap. lf someone has a problem with that idea, l'd like to hear about it. ls this how it's gonna be, sir? Yes, it is. Permission to be dismissed, sir? [Frank] Granted. Let's go, let's go. Keep it together. Look tight. Keep it together. Let's move. You have three minutes to get this gear on. All of it. [man] Set. Go! [♪ Kasabian: Club Foot] Let's go! Are you ready? [whistle blows] Hello, I'm a rescue swimmer! Don't quit on me. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Pop tall! Pop tall! Pop tall! [all yelling] If you make a mistake, just fess up to it, take your licks, and we'll press on. Everybody now is going to pay for your potty mouth. - Down. Up... Down. - [all] One! - Up. - [all] Three! - Down. Up. - [all] Five! [chanting] Are you crazy? That's a command to get up! - [all] Ooh-rah! - Get down. Get down. [cheering, yelling] [grunting] Ooh-rah! - Ooh-rah! - Ooh-r... [grunts] [air horn blows] Ah. Can you die from chlorine poisoning? l can't feel my legs. l'm serious. I don't know about you guys, but I feel good. This Randall guy, he's operating on some whole other cylinder. What is it, two weeks and he's failed half the class? - Mmm-hmm. - He's a legend. - They say he's got like 200 saves. - l heard it was three. Who cares what his number is? lf he's such a stud, what's he doing here? Whoo. How we feeling, boys? Hey, Z, where you going? My sister's best friend is getting married and they're having a big reception. l promised her l'd go. You said a wedding reception? [yelling inside van] [chattering] All right, boys, let's go eat. [woman singing Mockingbird] - Congratulations. - Thanks. [chattering] [Ben] Yes, uh, Kodiak, Alaska. The number for Helen Randall. Um... OK, try Helen Freeman. You betcha. [phone ringing] [answering machine] Hi. You've reached Helen. Leave a message. Helen, it's Ben. Jesus, that was weird. You haven't had to use your maiden name since we were kids. Helen, if you're there, just pick up. We need to talk. Please. [turns off phone] [all laughing] All right. All right. To those who have fallen, to those who have survived phase one. - Cheers. - Cheers. [overlapping chatter] And... and to our gal, Lindsey. You can rescue me anytime. - Did he just say that? - You did not just say that. - You did not just say that. - You know what, Duran? You, l think l might actually let drown. [all] Oh! [woman singing Hold On I'm Coming] Hey, Senior Chief. Good to see you. Maggie is hot tonight. The place has not changed. - From Kodiak, Alaska... - Don't. ...Senior Chief Ben Randall is in the house. Big as day and still alive. I must owe somebody money. [laughing] - You're terrible. - Oh. I heard a rumor you were gonna be teaching here in town. lf that ain't the karmic wheel spinning, l don't know what is. [sighs] Well... To the prodigal's return. Where's your better half? She decided to stay home. - Oh. [laughing] - Work stuff. Yeah. Winter in Kodiak. Let me see, winter in Louisiana. - Stop. - And she decided to stay home. Well, it's a good thing we got a full bottle and half the night. Yes, we do. [lounge music playing] Ooh. Check it out. She's staring at you. - That girl is not staring at me. - Did you just point at her? - Did she see you point? - I don't know. [chuckling] Now you gotta talk to her. You gotta go make a move. - Yeah. - I... I can't. l don't feel comfortable now, talking to women. - You want to jump out of helicopters... - You're talking to me. - ...but you can't talk to a girl? - That's what l was telling you. All right, look. l'm gonna help you out here. l'll show you how it's done. [clears throat] Pick out the hottest girl in here, l'll take her home. Oh, gosh. - No, how about l will find the girl? - Here he goes now. All right. - Okey-doke. - Who you thinking? Make sure she's hot. - Where are you looking? - OK. At the bar, uh... Two o'clock. - Oh. Yes. - That's a good one. - That one? - Yeah, that one. A hundred bucks says she shuts you down in less than a minute. [chuckles] That looks like a bet to me, Jake. That's a bet. All right. All right. A hundred bucks says l close in less than a minute. Oh. Absolutely. - A little liquor. - Hats off, man. - Tick-tock, tick-tock. - The clock starts when l talk to her. - Fine. - This is gonna be embarrassing. - All right, buddy. - [man 1] What do you think? - Think he's gonna do it? - [man 2] No. Evening, ma'am. Can l buy you a drink? l don't think so. [whispering] You don't know what you're missing. [scoffs] You sure you wanna go with that one? That's your top of the line, A-game material? See, the way l see it, you got two choices here. Walk away from me, or walk out of here with me and split the cash. Cash? [scoffs] What cash? The money you bet your friends you could pick me up. - See, that makes me nervous. - She's shutting him down. How much time you got left? - About 20 seconds. - Shall we? - [Lindsey] Oh, my God. - [weatherly] No way. [Hodge] lt looks like they're leaving together. No way. You have got to be kidding me. - Unbelievable. - How'd he do that? - I'm impressed. - I'm impressed. There's a bar outside your base called Maggie's. You know it? - Yeah. - Good. Meet me there next Friday around eight? - You got a name? - Yeah. Don't forget my money. - [car starts] - You got a middle name? You do realize l can't go back in there? [alarm buzzing] This is the sound of death knocking. SAR alarms and sleep deprivation are part... Where the hell are they? [all shivering, shuddering] The first stages of hypothermia are the most critical... Why? Because you still have the ability to think. Say it. [all] We still have the ability to think. The decisions you make during this stage are gonna determine whether you live or die. [Ben] There a reason you're not breathing, Goldfish? Huh? Is there a reason why you're not breathing? I don't know anyone who can stay alive without breathing for 15 minutes, Senior Chief. Are you a coroner? Because pronouncing people dead is not part of our job description. - What do we always say? - [all] There's dead and there's dead. We never stop, Jake. Not from the cabin to the tarmac. We never stop. - Aye, aye, Senior Chief. - Understood? - [all] Yes, Senior Chief. - OK, Jake. ln the pool. - Hodge, you're up. - You're with the dummy. [gasping] All right, now. Three letters. Three letters will get you people a cup of hot coffee and a blanket. What do you say, Goldfish? l'm actually not that cold anymore, Senior Chief. You're not cold anymore because blood is moving from your... ...outer extremities to your heart. That's why your arms won't work. You can plan on spending roughly 60 percent of your career in a mildly hypothermic state. Senior Chief, may I have a word? Yes, sir? Why wasn't I informed of this? We have classrooms. Your assignment is to simply teach the stages of hypothermia. [shivering] Sir... in about two and a half minutes, they'll understand. Permission to carry on, sir? Go ahead. [grunting] [all groaning] [shivering] Three letters, people, will get you a... ...hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket. [chuckling] What do you say, class 5506? [all weakly] Ooh-rah. [Ben] This is an oxygen deprivation, anaerobic exercise. You and your partner will push your brick along the bottom of the pool, down and back. If you need air, you may surface. One breath. Your partner must remain underwater until you return. Your brick can only move while both of you are touching it. If you both surface, you both fail. This exercise is designed to teach you teamwork. On my whistle, drop your gear into the pool and pair up. [gasping, panting] l said one breath, Sunkist, let's go. - I can't... I can't. - Come on. l can't. Get your ass out of the pool, let's go. Come on! Lean and rest. You wanna quit, just quit now. I could use those new shoes. Senior Chief, we've got a problem. Somebody's missing. Jesus Christ. That's gotta be a new record. Ooh-rah. I'm so sick of records. Go get him. [gasping, panting] You think l'm impressed because you can hold your breath, Goldfish? I wouldn't venture to say what would impress you, Senior Chief. Get him out of the pool. We're done for the day. Out of the pool, Fischer, let's move. - Ooh-rah! - Move your ass. - Pop tall, Sunkist. - [Lewis] Out of the pool. I want you right here, class leaders. The rest of you dress down. Right here, let's go. Records. Never stare directly into the flame, people. lt will impair your night vision. This is a Mark 58 flare. This is what it looks like. It will light up a 50-foot swath of water, and can be detected by infrared miles out. This is a demonstration model. The normal one will burn for 40 to 60 minutes. [Hall] Hey, pay attention. The Mark 58 is used to reference the wind, to detect the current. Officer Watson is gonna talk a little bit more about that. Five minutes. The vessel you're looking at right now is listing to the port side. As a rescue swimmer, you need to look down and pay attention to what you really have down there. lt's very important that you understand your limitations. Limitations without understanding are gonna get you killed. Case in point, this vessel's trapped in pancake ice in the Bering Sea. As you can see the crew on the deck in a relatively manageable hoisting position. But suddenly... Those pieces of ice can weigh in upwards of thousands of pounds. Now imagine yourself trapped in between two thousand-pound pieces of ice, - trying to free swim. - Thank you, Chief. Next scenario, Petty Officer Watson. [Watson] Before you leave that helicopter... Standardization is one of the reasons we were so successful during Katrina. We had crews come in from all over the country. But it didn't matter, because we have all been trained the same way. l didn't know my pilot, my co-pilot or my flight mechanic. But it didn't matter, because... That's why we do it. So you have to get your mind wrapped around that idea. When that helicopter starts going. When the wind starts coming. - Down. Up. - [all] Twenty! - Down. Up. - [all] Twenty-one! - Down. Up. - [all] Twenty-two! - Down. Up. - [all] Twenty-three! - Two... Three. - Down. Up. [chanting] Don't need no land Don't need no trees Out in the water there's work for me [♪ She Daisy: Something to Talk About] - Hey, Mags, can I have a beer? - Sure. Well, well. So you are gonna have a drink with me. No, l'm having a drink near you. Entirely different thing. Pretty little lightning rod, aren't you? - What's your name? - Daisy Buchanan. You're lying, Daisy Buchanan. There is that possibility. That was a sure-fire lie. So I take it you've read The Great Gatsby? - Where's my money? - It's not on me. But it is close, in a very safe place. Now, I've drawn a map, with a complex set of clues. Each one is more fiendishly clever than the last. That works too. This is just a picture of your pants. Yeah, but it's a bad picture, which is what makes it so fiendishly clever. [laughing] How did Emily Thomas become a school teacher? How does Jake Fischer become a guy who wants to jump out of helicopters? l killed a couple guys and had to get out of Dodge. [laughs] You're lying. There's that possibility. [laughs] The truth. My bull-riding career was going down the drain. OK, that's better. All right, now you. - l really should go. - Go? No, you're not going. We're starting to have fun. - You're insulting my drawing. - You were insulting your drawing. Although, to be fair, it's pretty lame. - You can't go. You owe me a dance. - No, I don't think so. l'll have to take that money back. l wouldn't feel right... Every 18 weeks a new bunch of you guys comes in looking to score with the local talent. l live here. l work here. lt's a good thing l'm just asking for a dance, then. [Maggie singing Love and Happiness] OK, one dance. No attachments. Just casual. I'm a guy. I can do casual. Mmm-hmm. - l am the king of casual. - Mmm. There's just one thing, though. You're gonna have to stop undressing me with your eyes. There's no way you're getting me into bed. Hey, you. [chuckles] l gotta get to work. I'm late. - Wh... What is it? - They're gonna kill me. They don't hand out tardies in the military. - You smell really good. - l smell like you. - He never came back? - Nope. Wow. Four years as lead instructor, I never had one go missing. Take the others to the pool. l'll catch up. Aye, aye, Senior. [marching cadence] Oh, God, there they are. Stop the car. - Here? - Yes. - l'll call you. - You better. Bye. [marching cadence continues] [Emily] Jake! Jake! Jake! [Skinner] Airman Fischer's coming in late yeah! [all] Airman Fischer's coming in late, yeah! - Oh, ah, oh, ah, ay! - Hi. [all] Oh, ah, oh, ah, ay! [Skinner] Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah! [all] Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah! Oh, my goodness, look at this. Look at this. "Freshman leads team to state title." That's you. Holy smokes. "At only 16, Jake Fischer displays the traits of a seasoned athlete. One thing's for sure, the future looks bright for this young competitor." Hmm. Guess they didn't know you were gonna flunk out of "A" School. [locker door slams] You have a nice evening? Get dressed. [muffled grunting] [panting, grunting] l think we need another brick. Bring it in. Goldfish. [all groaning] Thanks to Mr. Fischer's extracurricular activities, you have all now gone 36 hours without sleep. Blow it. Class leader, you are done. Form it up in the shallow end. Aye, aye, Senior Chief. Class 5506, form it up! [chuckling] No... No, no, no, no, no. You're with me. [chanting] I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am! l'm here to pull your ass out of this jam! l drop from the helo and swing from the cable! All right, knock it off. l am having a hard time figuring you out, Fischer. You mean you like seeing your picture in the paper? ln it for the glory, maybe a few chicks, am l right? But when it comes down to it, you will choose yourself over them every time. Like you did on the first day in the pool. Like you did yesterday, on missing muster. It won't happen again, Senior Chief! Why don't you do us both a big favor and quit? [chanting] I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am! l'm here to pull your ass out of this jam! l drop from the helo and swing from the cable! l'm not Tarzan! l'm just willing and able! [panting] Give me something else, Senior Chief! - [man] One, two, three. - [all] Thirty-one. - [man] One, two, three. - Thirty-two. - [man] One, two, three. - Thirty-three. - [man] One, two, three. - Thirty-four. - [man] One, two, three. - Thirty-five. - [man] One, two... - Thirty-six. - [man] One, two... - [Skinner] Stop. Drop 'em. Senior Chief's on deck. Pop tall. [all] Ooh-rah! [Ben whistling] [Ben] Good morning, class. Today we were going to learn about how to approach a drowning victim in high seas. But there's some here who aren't interested in that victim. There's some in this class who aren't interested in saving lives at all. l believe there are some who are more interested in setting records. So today is record day. [♪ Black Rebel Motorcycle Club: Ain't No Easy Way Out] [chuckling] 5:28. Put one on the board for Goldfish. Wow. He's fast. He's good. You got it, man! You got it, Fisch! - Another record. Chalk it up! - Whoo! - Get some! - [Ben] You are the man! You people do not deserve to be in the same pool as Jake. He's destroying you! Wow. Look at him go. He's fast. Wow. He's fast. Come on. You're all fighting for seconds. Just first loser. This is fun. We'll pass out trophies later. Unbelievable. Want me to pull these pansies out? You do not want to hear about my day. Yeah, l do. [groans] Man, this guy, Randall... You know, it doesn't matter what I do. It's just not good enough. Maybe he's just trying to push you to be better. We teachers do that to the ones we believe in. No. lt's personal with me. He knows that l'm better than he was. I mean, today I broke every one of his records. l mean, it's like, l own them all. Not all of them. There's one record you won't break. The Sea Aegis. Medical ship, caught on fire. A nightmare. People burning in their beds. Ben Randall got every one of those people off, except for this one guy... Right when the ship started to go down, he reaches down and grabs this guy... He's hanging with this man's life in his hands, and the winch jams. lt's 20 minutes to the base. The man's screaming. Ben looks him dead in the eye and you know what he said? - He said, "l won't let go." - [Emily] What happened? Dislocated his shoulder, tore every tendon in his hand. But he didn't let go. Twenty minutes. Just fingertips. You break that record, then you give me a call. My day was all right. [♪ Abby Ahmad: Tri-Me] [soft music playing] So here's my thinking: We should go on a date. [chuckles] What do you call this? No, no, no. l'm talking about like a real date. You know, with like a nice restaurant. Some nice clothes. I'll get you some flowers. I thought we agreed to keep this casual. Just one steak. [stammering] What is...? One steak is not gonna forge some kind of a lasting emotional bond. I'm serious. - Yeah? So am I. - Yeah. lt's one dinner. What's it gonna hurt? If you ordered a steak, I'd imagine a cow would be involved. What, do you have an art gallery over here? What is this 2? Ah... lt's so the guy behind me knows what place he's coming in. [laughs] What about this one? That... [grunts] ...is the initials of the guys on my high school relay team. A drunken celebration gone wrong? [mock laughing] Something like that. - So, about this date... - Oh, God. Just dinner, right? No flowers. Where we will discuss nothing emotional or important. [sighs] l am fully prepared to do an entire hour on nothing but the Chicago Bears. And we can have meaningless sex immediately afterwards. [gasps] You think l'm gonna sleep with you on our first date? [scoffs] Think again. - [laughing] - You just head-butted me. - l'll teach you the breast stroke. - [Emily laughs] - lt's very complicated. - [Emily moans] - Different than the butterfly. - [chuckling] [exhales] l guess... l can't sleep. Well, of course you can't. Your wife left you. Your best friend died. You sound like a damn country song. - [grunts] - lf you had a dog, it'd be run over. So did she send you papers? - Yeah. - Did you read 'em? No, l did not. Well, you think you might ought to? There never was anyone else, Mags. Like Hell, Ben. You're a bigamist. You've been married to the Coast Guard all along. Give me that shoulder. - [groans] - You probably swum it out of socket, trying to prove you was still 19. Am l right? When the heck did we get old? Hell, l've always been old, Ben. You know what, though? l don't mind. lf my muscles ache it's because l've used them. It's hard for me to walk up them steps now. lt's 'cause l walked up 'em every night to lay next to a man who loved me. I got a few wrinkles here and there, but l've laid under thousands of skies with sunny days. Yeah. l look and feel this way, well, 'cause l drank and l smoked, l lived and l loved and danced, sang, sweat and screwed my way through... [chuckling] ...a pretty damn good life, if you ask me. Getting old ain't bad, man. Gettin' old, that's earned. [gasps] [exhales] There will come a time when you might have to decide who lives and dies out there. lt's a terrible responsibility, but it is one you will have to make as a rescue swimmer. The bigger reality is... ...it's also something you're going to have to live with as a human being. There will come a time when you are going to have to say "no." The most important person to keep alive is yourself. You'll be facing crews from five to 20, all saying, "Save me, save me." They're looking for a miracle. - How old are you, Hodge? - Twenty-four. At twenty-four years old, you have to become that miracle. You have to find a way to be that miracle. Looking right. Looking center. Looking left. Ooh-rah! lt's OK, sir. - I'm a rescue swimmer, I'm... - [grunts] - [gasping] - Again! [muffled grunting] [gasping, panting] All right, that's it. Time out. Panics every time, Senior. Hodge, over here. Hey. The only difference between you and the victim is the attitude in which you enter the water. You gotta be calm in the face of chaos. Do you understand? That's your first challenge, Charlie. One more, and you're gone. - Come out. - Aye, aye, Senior Chief. - What's up? - Hey, Fisch. You don't have to take his shit, Hodge. What do you know? It's so easy for you, Fischer. ls that right? [Hodge] Yeah. No, you don't get it. You don't realize that you're tougher than l am. And how's that? lf l get kicked out of here, l'm not coming back. l'm definitely not coming back twice. - I mean, you got guts, man. - Stupidity. How long you been here, man? All together, uh, l don't know. Ten weeks first time, six weeks, two days second time. Six weeks this time. You've been here longer than anybody that's graduated. But you don't think you can make it. Lighten up on yourself, man. Let's go. Let's get a beer. Hey, wait, don't you have a date with your girl from the wedding? Yeah, but it's not till nine. We got time. Get dressed. - Let's go. - [exhales] [♪ Stevie "Funkworm" Butler featuring Gravity: Shake Up the World] Wait, wait. Where are we going? Uh, Jake, that's a squid bar. There's Navy guys everywhere. l don't give a shit. A beer's a beer. When pulling through the water, you'll pull yourself through. - [Hodge] So l'll go fast. - You wanna pull it. [country music playing] You get those fittings replaced before you came out to get tanked up? - Yes, sir, captain. - l'll believe that when l see it. We go to "A" School, the most difficult school in the military. The attrition rate's... what is it, 50 percent? - Fifty percent. - lt's over 50 percent. We're still here 'cause we're the best of the best. When storms shut down entire ports, you know who goes out? Uh, we do. When hurricanes ground the US Navy, these little guys over here, guess who goes out. That's right, we do. Honey, you better keep it down in here, OK? OK, honey. She called me honey. OK, honey. But when God Himself reaches down from heaven... - What does he do? - Rips houses off the foundation. When God Himself rips houses off the foundation, we go out. 'Cause we are rescue swimmers and that is our job, and that's what we do. You might want to recheck your compass. This ain't no puddle pirate bar. Um, no problem because, uh, we were just leaving anyway. Sit down, Hodge. Drink. Finish your beer. Drink. - Yeah, sit, Hodge. - [Hodge] That's my beer, man. Finished now? Must be happy hour. [grunts] [yelling] [laughing] - Back off. - [grunts] Everyone in this place is retired Navy. Hey. Hey, when do l get that phone call? I know I get a phone call. When do I get my phone call? [piano music playing] Ma'am, I'm sorry, but if nobody comes in 20 minutes, l need the table. - OK. Yeah. - l'm sorry. She's never gonna talk to me again. You know they'll kick us out for this, right? Yep. At least they can't say we quit. l was never gonna make it, anyway. Skinner's right. l panic every time. Screw Skinner. - l'm Skinner. Break my hold. - Hey, what are you doing, man? - Come on, get off me. - Clock's ticking. Break it. You're hurting me, man. Fischer, get off me, man. Come on, you're hurting me. Man, get off. - Break the goddamn hold. - Get off me! - Break the goddamn hold, Hodge. - Fischer, get off me! - [grunts] - l said get off me! All right. Now it's just like that when you're in the water. Well, now, we can come back. Give you boys time for a smoke and some pillow talk. [guards laughing] - [Fischer] Can't kick us out. - lt's disorderly conduct. Yes, we can. - We didn't fail. - Our profession is about control. You both failed miserably. Hold it right there. - [Skinner knocking] Senior? - Yeah. Their disenrollment records. - Bar fight? - Mmm-hmm. - All right, bring 'em in. - Senior. Square it! lt's all my fault, Senior Chief. Hodge had nothing to do with it. - ls that true, Hodge? - lt's true. All right. Fine, you're dismissed. - Senior Chief, l was... - l said that you are dismissed. Let's go. You're gonna kick me out for defending the Coast Guard? It's been around for 200 years. l doubt knuckleheads like yourself are gonna defend it. Sit down. l've been trying to peel the layers back on you for a while now and l... l just don't get it. This kind of work seems a little remedial for someone like yourself. Big swim champ, offer to every lvy League, you give it all up to be here with us. Why? l'm here to save lives, Senior Chief. [exhales] I spoke with your coach, Jake. - You spoke with my coach? - I spoke with your coach. Something in your file just kept... kept hanging me up. You win the state championship your freshman and sophomore year, then you don't swim the next two. l'm just a public school guy, so, uh... Pardon me, but it didn't add up until... now. "Kirk Holloway, 100 meter medley winner, thrown through the passenger window. Pronounced dead at the scene. Abe lkeman, first team All-American. Lungs crushed. Carl Sandoval. 50 meter freestyle champ, made it all the way to the hospital. Died of internal bleeding." l guess you just know everything, then. l know what it's like to lose a team. Yeah? What about living in a small town where everyone thinks you killed their brother, or their son, or their best friend? You know about that? The kind of small town where everyone still waves to everyone... ...just not to you? l read the report, Jake. Your blood alcohol was zip that night. l'm guessing there was a flip for designated driver. You lost. l guess that just makes it all go away, huh? No, it doesn't make it all right. lt just makes it an accident. At least that's how it reads. You were 16 years old, Jake. l'm not your priest, but if l was, l think... I think maybe you deserve a pass. You're giving me a pass? You just think you know everything. With your psychobabble bullshit. Why am l here? Why are you here? Huh? You're too old to be doing this. You washed up here. You don't want to be teaching a bunch of kids at a pool. Am l right? I don't give a shit what you read, or who you talked to. You don't know about me. You don't... I have me under control. l can see that. The only difference between you and me is... ...I don't wear the ones I lost on my arm, Jake. I know where you're at, Jake. l'm there myself. I ask myself every day why I was the one that survived. - And? - And... And if I can't answer that for me, I'm not going to try and answer it for you. Have a seat. l want you to start being a member of this team. The team you have now. You have a gift, Jake. You're the best swimmer to come through this program, by far. You got a whole record board to prove it. But you know what I see when I look at it? I see someone fast enough who's gonna get there first. I see someone strong enough who's gonna last. I see someone... ...who can save a life that maybe nobody else could. You really want to honor the initials on your arm? Then honor your gift. Save the ones you can, Jake. The rest... we've gotta let go. Does this mean you're not gonna fail me? For what? Backing up a buddy in a bar? Man, l got bigger problems than you. l don't know about you, but l could use a fucking drink. Oops. We're gonna consider everything tonight off record and off duty. - That was an invite. - Oh. You gotta be kidding me. What was it they called you? Puddle pirates. But it's not... l'm... l'm way over it, Senior Chief. This is... That's like sticks and stones. Well, we'll just have one beer. [country music playing] Great. They're angrier and drunker. - Perfect. - Hi. Two beers. - You gotta be kidding me. - That's what l said. Look, I don't want any trouble, OK? They really don't like us, do they? They think they're better than us because they're combat-oriented. We're the Coast Guard, Jake. Nobody really appreciates us until they need us. ls that him? Yep. Let me ask you a question before we start bleeding. All those saves... What's your real number? Do you have a death wish or are you just shit stupid? l'm gonna go with stupid this time. - Hi. - Hi. Who's this, your old man? [chuckling] l'm really glad you're still here. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. [grunting] - Behind you. - [man] Stand down! l said stand down! l think you'd better leave. OK. Come on, Jake. [country music continues] All right, sit down. Have a beer. - That went better than l thought. - Yeah. - What the hell was that? - l don't know. Hey, uh, I want to, uh, apologize to you. About what l said earlier, about you being old and washed up and that. ls there...? ls there anything you'd like to say to me? Like what? l don't know. l apologized to you. l just thought that... ...there might be something you've said or done that you'd like to apologize to me for. Why? 'Cause that's how it's done. l... You suck at apologies. You know that? You're missing the whole concept. [phone ringing] - Hello? - [Jake] Hi. It's me. [exhales] Are you OK? What happened? I mean, I waited for two hours. Yeah... No, I'm... I'm really sorry. I... - What happened? - Um, it's a really long story. Let me just... [sighs] Let me put it this way. lt was the... ...best worst night of my life. Well, I'm glad someone had fun. Can I... see you tomorrow night? I have parent-teacher conferences tomorrow. What about the next night? l have parent-teacher conferences all week. - You blowing me off? - No, Jake. l wouldn't do that to somebody. I gotta get up in a couple hours. I gotta go. Yep. Goodbye. [dial tone] [Ben] You know what we preached on the ground. Same thing. We're gonna stay together. No matter what happens out there, you stay together. Whatever decision you make, you make as a team. We train to freefall at 15 to 20 feet. You fall from 50 feet, that's like hitting concrete. You fall 80 to 100 feet... you die. Where are they going? They're supposed to come back, right? Hodge, you've been here before. They'll come back, right? But l never made it this far. - You're kidding? - Not to the final week. They're not coming back. - What do we do? - All right. Listen up. We stay together as a group. Nobody falls behind. We all stay together. One guy goes back, we get him back up to the front, OK? We're a team. - Ooh-rah! - Ooh-rah! Let's do it, 5506. Sir, it's OK. l'm with the US Coast Guard. [grunting] [Skinner] Again! [grunts] l'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer. l'm here to help you. [blows whistle] Time out. Class, pop tall. Hodge, get yourself to the side of the pool. Aye, aye, Senior Chief. [all] Ooh-rah! Easy, Chief. Guess that was a lucky punch. Hodge! You stay right there. Well done, Charlie. Well done. Ooh-rah, Chief Skinner. Class 5506, ooh-rah, Hodge. On three... - One, two, three! - [all] Ooh-rah, Hodge! Good for you. - Get their gear off. - [all yelling] Get it off! Move! l can't believe... [all yelling] [overlapping shouts] - Get it off! - Yeah. Class 5506, will you come find me if I am lost? [all] Yes, Senior Chief! Will you come save me if I am drowning? [all] Yes, Senior Chief! I believe you would. I have high hopes for this class. I have high hopes for you. Matthew Stokes, Savannah, Georgia. - Matthew, job well done. - Ooh-rah, captain. Kenneth Weatherly, Clearwater, Florida. Go out there and do great things. William Hodge, Astoria, Oregon. - Where's Senior Chief? - He had a chance to go back to Kodiak. He never had much of a bedside manner. He's a water dog, Jake. As it turns out, not a half bad teacher. Best of luck. Jacob Fischer, Kodiak, Alaska. Congratulations, Jake. Make us proud up there. - Aye, aye, captain. - Scott Reeves, Sitka, Alaska. Ladies and gentlemen, your graduates. - [man] Ooh-rah. - [applause] - Congratulations. - Thanks a lot. - Good job, Weatherly. - Good job. - Sorry. - [laughs] - Well, congratulations. - Thank you. - l... - lt's OK. We both knew where this was going, right? Just casual. Right. You're getting what you've always wanted. And always wanting more. Take care of yourself, Jake. [sighs] - I gotta go to work. - Yeah. [sighs] [seagulls squawking] [man] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the rock. l'm Captain William Hadley, C.O. of Kodiak air station. - Fischer. - Yeah, right here. - Mr. Michetry will square you away. - Welcome. The rest of you step up here with Mr. Christiansen. He'll process you in. Oh, amazing. Not only does he come back in great shape, but he still thinks he can cook. - Hello, Jake. Welcome. - How you doing? - Good to see you again. - You guys keep it warm here. Glad to know you know where a free meal is. We need three crews in Sitka for the weekend. And the stand team arrives here next Tuesday. Patch things up with the wife? You fix things up with that young lady? Well, you still have a choice, you know. Hey, there was a question I wanted to ask you back in school. And l didn't. But, um... When you can't save 'em all... ...how do you choose who lives? lt's probably different for everybody, Jake. Kind of simple for me, though. l just... l take the first one l come to. Or the weakest one in the group and then l swim as fast, and as hard as I can, for as long as I can. And the sea takes the rest. Think l'm ready? l'm not your teacher anymore, Jake. l'm just your fellow swimmer. That's not exactly the answer l'm looking for, there. lf l did not think you were ready, l would not put you in the Bering Sea. [woman on radio] 6030, this is Kodiak Ops. We are diverting your training mission. Two young kayakers swept into the cave a mile south of Saltery Cove. How copy? [co-pilot] 6030 copies. We're diverting. [pilot] Got a real case. OK, guys. High tides coming in and we've got six to eight foot rollers. Senior, what do you think about taking Fischer? l want him with me. All right, he's good to go. l don't think it'll be a problem sliding in. The problem's gonna be coming back out. That's why l got Jake with me. Got my human speedboat. [pilot] Kodiak Ops, this is 6030. We're on scene at this time. No sign of kayakers. l'm taking her down. Cabin door is open and locked. [pilot] Those are definitely ten foot waves. Swimmer is coming through the door. Remember, all right. You've got the whole weight of the ocean punching through that opening. You gotta read the hydraulics, you gotta count the waves. Then wait for the flush. [man] Checking swimmer. Sure hope you paid attention in class, Speedboat. Swimmers in the water, swimmers OK. Swimmer two is making contact with swimmer one. - Hey! Over here. - Here. - Over here. - Shout out. Three o'clock. [man] We're right here. We're rescue swimmers. We'll get you out. l can't believe you got here. Give me your hand. - Just the two of you? - Yeah. His arm's hurt bad. All right. Swimmer one, I got, uh, two survivors. lt's gonna be a basket pick up here. - [pilot] Roger. - Broken here? You take him first. Get him in the basket. l'll follow with the other one behind you. - You got that? - Yeah. - You got it? - Yeah. l'm gonna lower you down, all right? Relax, buddy. l got you. - All right. You're with me. - OK. [groaning] I don't swim so good. - You don't swim so good? - No, sir. That's OK. l swim pretty good. All right, on your back. - Wait. Aren't we gonna take the boat? - l'm the boat. Wait, wait, wait. l'm afraid. l'm not ready. - Hey! - l can't go without the boat. Settle down! [man] Something's not right. Swimmer one's going back. What happened? He hit a log. What? What do you...? [grunting] [groaning] - He's gone, Jake. - He's not! [coughing] He's just got a head laceration! - Here we go. - [groaning] Let's go. Let's go! Senior Chief Randall. Lock it in. Simple physics. We're just gonna time the flush, all right? All right... You call it, swimmer. [spits] [Jake] Now! Hey. l know you're tired, OK? l know you feel tired right now. l need you to keep your eyes open, OK? All right? All right? Hey, l need you to keep talking to him. Keep talking to him. Senior. Senior! Can you open these up for me? One by one I want you to hand them to me. Reyes, he's fine. - Right here, buddy. Right here, OK? - [man] OK. [woman crying] Robert! He's got a compound fracture of his right radius. We tried to stabilize that a bit. We put a collar on this one, but it was more precautionary. - Thank you. - This one's possibly concussive. We've been checking their vitals. Their both mildly hypothermic but l think they'll come around. - Bye. - Thank you so much. You're welcome. It happens, Ben. Not to me. Not like that. I want you to sign them in front of me. - Why don't you take some time to think? - No. lt's, um... It's over. Just... sign them. Please. It could have happened to anyone. Maybe. But what if it happens again? What then? The kid got a couple stitches. He's gonna be fine. - You got him out of there. - No, you did. You were strong out there today. I was proud of you. What are you gonna do? A friend of mine once suggested fishing. Think l might take his advice. - Fishing? - Yeah. Well, guys like us don't go fishing. [chuckles] Where have l heard that before? Senior... Before you go, I gotta know one thing. What's your real number? Twenty-two. Twenty-two? That's not bad. lt's not 200, but it's not... Twenty-two is the number of people I lost, Jake. Only number l kept track of. Keeps the sea out of your mouth. [dog barking] [door opening] - Hey. - Hi. You started painting again? Yeah. Great light up there. Yeah. You know, um... l want to apologize for the phone calls, Helen. I should have given you your space. You felt showing up here unannounced was the best way to communicate that? Hey. - Please just... - Ben. I want you to have it, along with... Along with these. l... l signed them. Why now? l had a... I had a case a while back, you know. A couple was drowning. By the time l got there, the husband was dragging his wife under, just... ...trying to stay afloat. Pure survival instinct. It took me, um... lt took me a long time to understand that... ...that man was me. - [exhales] Oh, man. - [beeping] Doggone it. [turns off beeper] Sorry. Aren't you gonna answer that? l'm not a rescue swimmer anymore, Helen. [sniffling] My baby. [door opens and closes] Lock it up! We have a 75-foot fishing vessel taking on water in high seas. She's dead in the water with four souls on board. With its de-watering pumps unable to keep up, it's not a matter of if this thing is going down, but when. [man yelling indistinct] [yelling indistinct] - [alarm beeping] - [radio chatter] [Ben] There will come a time when you are going to have to say no. You'll be facing crews from five to 20, all saying, 'Save me, save me.' They're looking for a miracle. At 24 years old, you have to find a way to be that miracle. [pilot] We'll plan our freefall deployment to the water. - You good with that? - Copy. OK, if we have to put you in, we're gonna get you in upswell, and let the waves take you down. - You good with that? - Roger. We'll only have about 20 minutes. So we gotta be quick. Copy that. [pilot] l got the vessel in sight. Two o'clock, about 50 meters. [yelling] Cabin door open and locked. Pre-rescue checklist for freefall deployment. Whoa! Boat just took a wave. One appears to have gone on the edge. - Hanging from the cargo net. - [screaming] - Get our swimmer down there. - [radio chatter] [man] Deploy up top. Prepare for freefall deployment of the rescue swimmer. [screaming] Checklist part two. Swimmer's getting ready. Checklist complete. Swimmer's coming out. [pilot] Roger. Check swimmer. Swimmer's at the door, sir. Checking swimmer. Swimmer ready? God help you if you ain't, boy. Swimmer's away. Swimmer's OK. He's heading toward the vessel. He's cutting through those waves pretty good. That's it. He's approaching the vessel. He's at the boat, sir. Man, are we glad to see you! [man on PA] Coast Guard Cutter Alex Haley ten miles southwest of Ashlock. [pilot] Rescue 6034. Fischer is on board, but vessel is compromised. Taking on water. May not hold much longer. Stand by for... How many guys you got on here and is anybody injured? l've got four guys. This guy's got a broken leg. Skipper's down below. He's trying to start the pump. - He's gonna go first. - All right! [pilot] Kodiak Ops, Rescue 6034. Three with injuries, one more down below. What do you want me to do? - [creaking] - All right. [grunting] - Help me get him around in here. - Come on. - Bring it on in. All right. - [yelling] Basket is on its way up. [yelling] - Drop in. - [groaning] Captain's below. One other man on deck. Help him out. Get out of the way. [pilot] I repeat, the boat's going down fast. Eight minutes to bingo. All right, come on. Get in the basket. [pilot] l have the ready-for-pickup signal. Hold on. [man] Swimmer one, swimmer one, come in. Rescue swimmer, 6034, Fischer, come in, Fischer. Swimmer one, swimmer one, come in. - [Jake] Swimmer one. - Roger, swimmer one. Go ahead. I've got one down below. I'm gonna go down there. Swimmer one, be advised. We've got seven minutes to bingo. I'm going down. - Captain. - Yeah. - Captain. - Here. [groaning] Captain, l'm a rescue swimmer. l'm here to help you out. ls your leg jammed in here, or is it just...? [screams] lt's the whole leg. l tried to free the clutch and it got stuck. [groans] Swimmer one. l got the captain here in the engine room. He's stuck. - We're gonna be a little bit. - [pilot] We're out of time. - Boat's listing. Two minutes to bingo. - l ain't leaving here without him. Uh... send somebody back for us 'cause l'm staying here with him. [pilot] Negative, swimmer one. We need you topside, ASAP. - Swimmer one, 6034. - [static] Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops, this is 6034. Be advised, we are RTB at this time. We are leaving a rescue swimmer on scene. I say again, we are... What do we have left in the shop? - 08's all we've got, but no crew. - Right. Get her on line. - Yes, sir. - Krauss, suit up. We're handling this. l need a swimmer. Don't worry. No, no. They'll get him. Don't worry. Don't worry. [groaning] Here we go. Pull up. Pull up. - Ready to go home? - Yeah, man. [grunting] Captain! Captain! [grunting] - We're cleared in, lieutenant? - Aye, aye, captain. Outstanding. [grunting] Rescue swimmer one, this is 6008. Do you read? Come in, rescue swimmer one. 6008, do you read me? Come on, Jake. Be there. [Jake grunting, banging] [helicopter blades whirring] Cabin door is open and locked. lt's right there. Right side, nobody on board. All right, l see where l want. Just get me down. The right hand corner. - Avoid the rigging. - Swimmer requests aft, right corner. - Aft, right corner. - OK, this is what we'll do. Do a rescue checklist part two for a harness deployment. [radio chatter] - We'll do the hoist at 100 feet. - Roger that. Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops, Rescue 6028. [man] Rescue 6028, Kodiak Ops, go ahead. Swimmer's ready. Load checking swimmer. Load check complete. Swimmer's going out the door. Swimmer's out the door. Swimmer's on his way down. Coast Guard helo, do you copy? Coast Guard helo, this is rescue swimmer one, do you copy? Port right 40. Port right 30. Watch your altitude. [Hadley] Roger. Hold, l have a failed cable, failed cable. Rescue helo, this is swimmer number one! l'm in the engine room and the hull of the boat is filling up! - Trying to free the cable. - Come on. OK, cable free, cable free. Attaboy. Cable's free. They got a fray right here. lt's still good. - l can use it. lt's all we got. - All right, good. - Go back and left, captain. - Back and left, roger. Jake! Come on. Come on! Jake! - Jake! - Senior! - Senior! l need help! - Goldfish! l checked all the locks on the doors. l can't get it loose. They're stuck. l know. l see the problem. lt's filling up, Senior Chief! Chief! Get me out of here! l'm almost submerged. You gotta get the door open! Hold on, Jake. [creaking] [gasping] - Senior, the captain's body. - We gotta let it go. Come on. Jake, he's gone! Jake. Both swimmers coming out. Both swimmers in sight. All right, l got 'em. - [grunting] - [yelling] [straining] Hook is going down. Let's go port right 40. Halfway down. l'm hooking into you. We're only gonna get one shot at this. l'm on. l'm in! l thought you were going fishing. What do you call this? - [cable snaps] - Whoa. Cable's starting to burst. The cable. Hold, hold. Hold there. We're bringing them up. We gotta get them that cable. What are you doing? - [grunting] - What are you doing? [unhooks latch] - Don't even think about it. - lt's not gonna hold us both. What...? Yes, it will. Don't! lt'll hold! [both grunting] [Krauss] Senior fell. Senior fell! Jake's got him. We gotta get them up. [groaning] l won't let go! I know. [Jake] Senior! Senior! Lower me down! He just fell. He just fell. Randall fell. - Lower me! - He's in the water. Hit by a wave. - Put me down! - l can't! You gotta lower me down, now! - [cable breaks] - Get me out of here! - You gotta lower me down! - l can't! - l'll freefall! - lf l do, you don't come back. I can't. I can't lose two. Lost swimmer. Lost swimmer. He saw the cable coming apart. He just let go. He was about 80, 90 feet up, sir. He didn't come up. l don't see him. Flash light, hover lights. Monitor the radio, sir. No flare, strobe or anything. He fell right into the debris. Lost swimmer. Lost swimmer. [Jake] The Coast Guard conducted one of the largest rescue missions for a single man in its history. But the body of Senior Chief Ben Randall was never found. - l'm sorry, Helen. - [sobs] - [crying] - There was nothing we could do. [Jake] What makes a legend? Is it what someone did when they were alive? [Hadley] Randall never was much for this. Or how they're remembered after they're gone? Some people actually believe Senior Chief made the swim to the Aleutian Islands. He's standing on a beach somewhere with a fishing pole in his hand. But I found my answer a couple weeks later. [shivering] Where is he? Huh...? - There's nobody else out there, man. - No, he was there. He was with me the whole time. He said he would hold on until help arrived. He never let go. [Jake] There's a legend of a man who lives beneath the sea. He's a fisher of men. A last hope for all those who have been left behind. He is known as The Guardian. Ben Randall always said life is about making choices. In the end, by making his... he helped me make mine. What do you remember? What did you smell? What did you see? How did this make you... ...feel? l'll be right back. What are you doing here? l lied to you. l can't do casual. [giggling]
