You say it was fear that killed you, Juan Preciado? Yes, Dorotea. I was killed by the whispers. I longed to be able to make out a few words. To distinguish them from noise. Pray to God for us. I heard them say to me: Then, the soul blackened. So you found me dead. It would have been better if you had not abandoned your land, Juan Preciado. What did you come here for? I told you so from the beginning. I came to find Pedro. I think, He was my father. It brought me here the illusion, P?ramo? He died long ago! The illusion? That is costly. The cost I paid was that I had to live longer than I should have. I thus paid the price for finding my son. Which was not, so to speak, but a mere illusion, because, I never had any children. You see? My body didn't even steal ground from the land. I was buried in your own grave. And my body fit nicely in the hollow of your arms. It is you who said all that Dorotea? Who? Me? I fell asleep for a while. And they keep scaring. I heard someone talking. A woman's voice. I thought it would be you. A woman? You thought it was me? The one who talks to herself. She of the big grave. Do?a Susanita San Juan. She is buried here, next to us. She must have felt the humidity and may be stirring in her sleep. And who is this? Pedro Paramo's last woman. It is said that she was given to him after much suffering, Maybe even crazy. The truth is that she talked to herself when she was alive. What about your soul? Where do you think your soul has gone, Dorotea? My soul? I opened my mouth to let it go. I had no strength left for more. I felt when the thread of blood, with which my soul was tied to my heart, broke. Can you hear her voice, Juan Preciado? Now she is suffering with the other souls in this purgatory. Hey, wait up! Donkey! Where are you going? I'm going downland. I go to a place called Comala. That's where I'm going. Why do you go to Comala? If I may know. I came to see my father. Well, you're in for a good surprise. He will be happy to see someone after so many years, no one comes to these parts. What does your father look like? I do not know him. I only know that his name is Pedro P?ramo. I am also the son of Pedro P?ramo. It's already starting to get hot around here. Everything is tense, as if waiting. Yes. And that's nothing yet. Calm down. This feeling will be even greater when we arrive in Comala. The place is on the embers of the earth. The very mouth of hell. Suffice it to tell you that many of those who died there, When they get to hell, they go back to Comala to get their blanket. Do you know Pedro P?ramo? Yes. A living malice. Donkey! This is my mother. Mother was always enemy of having her portrait taken. She used to say that portraits were black magic. I have this so that my father knows who I am. Have a look. It is that hill that looks like a pig's bladder. Because the Half Moon was used in its design. Now turn over there. Do you see the eyebrow on that path? Can you see that other ridge that you almost cant see from this far away? Well, that's the Half Moon. From one end to the other. As one says, all the land you can look at with your eyes. And all that land belonged to him. All this vast terrain. I already know this. My mother always said it. Go fuck yourself! I beg your pardon? We are almost there. Yes. Now I see it. Are you sure this is Comala? Pretty much. Why that place looks so empty. The current times. I go further. Between those hills, there is my home. If you want to come with me, you are welcome. I must go find my father. That brought me here. Donkey! Where can I find a room? Look for do?a Eduviges, if she is still alive. Tell her I sent you. Hey! What's your name? Me! Do you know where Eduviges lives? There! In the... first house... that... across the bridge. Good evening. Follow the sound of the river. I'm Eduviges Dyada. Come in. What's in here? Thrushes. Your room is down the hallway. So you are her son. Who? Doloritas. Yes. How do you know that? She told me you would come. She told me that today. That you would arrive today. Who, my mother? Yes. She. My mother. My mother is dead. Ah, that's why her voice sounded so weak. As if she had to cross a long distance to make herself heard. Now I got it. How long has she been dead? For seven days now. Poor thing. She must have felt forgotten. We made a promise to die together. To encourage one another during the last trip. For what it's worth. In case we encounter any difficulties. No bed? Don't pay attention to that. You must come tired and sleep is a very good cushion for tiredness. It's all about finding comfort. Tomorrow I will have a bed for you. Your mother just told me you were coming. We were very close. I heard about you from the muleteer who guided me on the road. Nice guy Abundio. So he remembers me. He asked me to look for you. I can only thank him. He was our letter carrier. And he kept doing it even after he went deaf. But the person I knew was not deaf. Then it's someone else. In addition, Abundio died many years ago, you see? It couldn't be him. Maybe. That man looked very much alive. Alright. Going back to your mother, What's wrong, do?a Eduviges? Not like this! Head first! Pay attention! Miguel! He is sleeping. Don't wake him up. Quiet. Who is this? It's Miguel, don Pedro. What did you do to him? Nobody touched him. His death is due only to him. There were petroleum lighters lighting up the night. The horse killed him! Tomorrow you slaughter that animal. To spare it from suffering. You are right, don Pedro. I understand it. The poor man must be devastated. This is also my understanding. While you're at it, tell those women not to make such a fuss. It's a lot of fuss about my death. If it was one of them, they wouldn't cry so hard. You look bigger than you were. For going around milking women and visiting mothers, that's why you waste your time. You were drowned by anxiety too soon, Pedro P?ramo. I knew that I would lose. I am starting to pay off my debt. It is better to start at once and finish soon. What do you want to hear from me? And that he died in good time. Is this a bad omen? Wake up. Wake up! Wake up... Why are you crying, mother? Your father just died. They have killed him. And you... Who killed you, mother? Over there is Miguelito's horse! Over there I saw the horse of young Miguel! I saw it. I saw it! The horse of Miguelito! A horse galloped past where the St. Real crosses the Contla road. It was being chased to be killed! It ran with its legs crossed. As if it was going to go flat on its face! It is Miguel P?ramo's dark horse! That animal is going to break its head. I saw it straighten its body. And without slowing down the race. It ran with its head thrown back. As if scared. For something it left behind. This is my child. There are clouds. And up there, a blue sky. Wherein, Maybe there are songs. Even better voices. A lot of hope. There are hope for us, even for us. But not for you, Miguel P?ramo. You died unforgiven. And you will deserve no grace. Padre. I want your blessing. No. I will not. He was a bad man and will not enter the kingdom of heaven! God would not want me to advocate for him. Our Father, who art in heaven, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven... Have mercy on your servant, O Lord. Rest in peace. Amen. I know you hated him, Padre. Deservedly so. The murder of his brother, which according to rumors was committed by my son. The case of his niece, Ana. Raped by him, and you said this. The offenses. Against you. These are things anyone can admit. Forget about this, Padre. Rethink it, and forgive him as perhaps God has already done. Those are yours. He can buy salvation. Is this the price? That's your call. About me, Lord... Before your feet, To ask you for what is fair or unfair. What we are all given to ask for. For me... Send him to hell, Lord. No, sir... Ana. Do you know who is being buried? No, Padre. Do you remember Miguel P?ramo? I do, Padre. You sure Miguel P?ramo did it, right? Not sure. I saw his face. It grabbed me at night, in the dark. So, how do you know it was Miguel P?ramo? Because he told me so. Miguel P?ramo did it, Ana. Don't be scared. Said to me. But you knew he was your father's killer. Yes. What did you do to keep him away from you? I did nothing. He told me that's what he was coming to. To say he was sorry. To forgive him. Without moving from the bed, I let him know, The window is wide open. He hugged me as if that was his way of apologizing for what he had done. I smiled at him. I thought about what you taught me, uncle. That you should never hate anyone. I smiled as I told him. But then I thought he couldn't see my smile. My smile... We couldn't see anything because it was so black that night. I only felt him on top of me, That he was starting to do dirty things to me. Do you think he would have killed me? That's what I thought it would happen, uncle. My mind went blank. To die before he killed me. But, for sure... He did not have the courage to do so. I knew it, as soon as I opened my eyes. And I saw the morning light coming through the open window. Before that moment... I thought I had ceased to exist. Something should confirm who he was. His voice. Couldn't you recognize him by his voice? I didn't know him in person. I only knew that he had killed my father. I had never seen him before. And then, I couldn't see him. I would not have been able to do so, uncle. But you knew who he was. Yes. What was it? I know he must be burning in hell right now. Because I have asked this to all the saints with all my faith. You shouldn't be so sure, girl. Who knows how many are praying for him. You are alone. A single prayer against thousands of prayers. And some of them more powerful than yours. Like the one of his father. But, let us praise God for taking him out of this world. Where he has done so much evil. It doesn't matter if he is now with him in heaven. She made you drink, Dorotea? Tell me. She went to the funeral of Miguelito, father. And I lost count of the drinks. They gave me so much to drink, I even became a clown. You've never been anything better, Dorotea. But now I bring you my sins, father! - Some while sober. - Don't confess. You're just here to waste my time. You can no longer sin, even if you want to. Leave that for anybody else. But now, father, is for real. As I cannot cause him any harm. I will tell you that I used to provide the girls for him, to the late Miguel P?ramo. From when? Huh! Since he was just a youngster. Since he felt the itch. Repeat what you just said, Dorotea. I was the one who arranged the girls for Miguel, father. Did you take them there? At times, yes. Other times I just convinced them. And with others, I just showed them. You know. Sometimes I would just tell him when he would find them alone. When he could catch them off guard! Were there a lot? I've even lost count. There were too many. What do you want me to do with you, Dorotea. Judge yourself, See if you can forgive yourself. I can not, father. That's why I came to see you. How many times you came here to ask me to send you to heaven when you died. You wanted to see if you could find your son there, Dorotea. Alright. You can't go to heaven. But God may forgive you. Shut up! When was your last confession? Two days ago, father. I only think of Pedro P?ramo! You are a married woman. Yes, father. But I want him. Father, Last night, I slept with Pedro P?ramo. I confess, Father, that I have a son of Pedro P?ramo. I confess, father, I lent my daughter to Pedro P?ramo. I confess, father, That I am carrying a son of Pedro P?ramo. Ana. Ana! Don't be scared. I'm Miguel P?ramo Don't be scared. The horse of Miguel P?ramo. Is riding back. I don't understand. I didn't hear any noise. No horse. No? No. Sure you can hear it. Is riding back. There was a time when he spent nights at my house. Living with me. And now? Can you hear it? What happened? Did she slam the door in your face? No, she still wants me. What happens is that I could not find her. Contla was lost to me. No matter how many times I turned around, I couldn't find that damn town. I don't know if it collapsed. Or it was swallowed by the fog. With as many sleepless nights as you've had. Somewhere you must have been caught in sleep. No sleep! Contla does not exist. I even gave the horse a rein to jump the fence, the one my father had put up the other day. and after that, I found nothing at all. Just smoke and more smoke. Darkness everywhere. I've come to tell you about it. Because those in Comala, as always, will say I'm crazy. Not crazy, Miguel. You must be dead. Remember how many times you were predicted that horse would kill you. Remember, Miguel P?ramo. Maybe you started to do crazy things and that's something else. In the morning, your father will die of sadness. Now go and rest in peace Miguel. I appreciate that, even after death you came to say goodbye to me. The boss is begging you. Miguel is dead. He begs you to accompany him. I know that. You were asked to go and cry. Yes. I was asked to cry for him. It's fine. Tell don Pedro I'll be there. My duties as administrator in the lands of the Half Moon. There is nothing to do, don Pedro. People are idle. They no longer want to work for you. The cattle must be moved to the upper part of Estagua. And the cattle of Estagua to take them to the hills of Vilmayo. If we don't, we will have a problem with rainfall. And why do you allow yourself to be dominated by these people, Fulgor? Times are changing, don Pedro. They are no longer content with corn alone. How much do they want to return to the crop? Maybe I can help them. Whatever your good intentions give them, don Pedro. They told me so. Remember that business is bad and there is no money for anything. To whom do we owe? I don't care how many but to whom. Here is a long list of names. But there is nowhere to find the money to pay. The mint... Preciados, Fragosos... guzmanes. Why is that? Because your family has sucked it all. However, there are those out there who are interested in buying the land and they pay well. It would be enough for the farming, and debits. And there might be something left. Although, very little. Wouldn't you be the buyer? How dare you? Do you think I am capable? I even believe in God. We will now start to settle our affairs. We will start with the mint. If you pleased, don Pedro. In addition, I am requesting a loan for this same amount. No problem. At your service. As we were always for your father. May he rest in peace. Gentlemen... So long. Gamaliel! Gamaliel! A client has arrived. Wake up already! Fuck! Comrades... Drunks... One toasting with them, and you come to wake me up. This life is worth a piece of shit. We should go to hell at once. What am I to blame? That drunks are free at this time of the day. My poor son. Forgive him, Abundio. The poor man spent the night caring to some travelers who drank until they had too many drinks. What are you looking for at this time of the morning. I only ask for a mezcal. Because I'm in need. Refugio fainted again. She is already dead, Mother Villa. Last night. Close to midnight. I had to sell my donkeys. I even sold that to pay for her treatment. I can't hear what you saying! Or you say nothing? What are you saying? Are you not going deaf? That I spent the night watching over the dead woman. Refugio... She stopped moaning last night. No wonder I smelled death. I even said to Gamaliel: It smells to me like someone just died in the town. But he ignored me. Are you expecting people for the memorial service? Just one. That's why I want a mezcal. To cure my hangover. Want it straight? Yes, Mother Villa. So it takes my fear away. And if you can give it to me quickly because I'm in a hurry. And if you want, you can give me what's left over. I'll give you 7 mezcals for the same price. Only for you. You must tell the departed, that I will always appreciate her. May she remember me when she stands before the Lord. Yes, mother Villa. Tell her, before her body cools down completely. I will. I know she is counting on you too. For you to offer your prayers. She died so sad. Nobody helped her. That you did not go to see Father Renter?a? I went but they told me he was in the hills. Poor us, Abundio. With these peyote buds, sorrow will go away from me. Don't call it peyote. It doesn't like it. Call it 'Mezcalito'. Don't you forget: this is a power. An ally. And what it teaches us. Everything will be easier to understand. Abundio Mart?nez. The fear, your worst enemy. You must defeat it. You need it. Then, give it to me, mother Villa! How you waste time! Anyway, Gamaliel is sleeping. But don't forget to ask Refugio, that prays for me. I need that so much. Don't worry about it. I will let her know as soon as I arrive. And I will even ask her for the promise in case it is necessary. This! You must do so. Because you know women. So you should demand immediate compliance. Have one for the road. You'll be thirsty. I'll take this next to Refugio. Next to my Cuca. You'd better be on your way, Abundio Mart?nez. What a miserable life, Mother Villa. And all for not having recognized me as his son, that bastard Pedro P?ramo! I am also a son of his. He even baptized me! For Preciados. You say we owe them a lot. And they have been paid less. You always moved them to the bottom of the list. I understand that one of them, Matilde, She went to live in the capital. I do not know if in Guadalajara or Colima. And Lola, I mean... Do?a Dolores, she is now the owner of everything. Owner of the ranch, it is to her that we must pay. Tomorrow you're going to ask for Lola's hand. How do you think she would want to marry me? I'm an old man. You will ask her to marry me. If you think about it, it's a funny move, You will tell her that I am in love with her. And that if she sees it right, You also tell the father to arrange for the wedding. How much money do we have? Nothing, don Pedro. Well, make a pledge. As soon as we have money, we will pay him. I am sure he will not make any trouble. Do all this tomorrow. Pedro! Pedro! Like this! Like this! Hold on tight to the thread! Tighter! Now let go of some thread! Pedro! Let it go! More! More! I'm thinking of you, Susana... In your still water eyes, and your hair, like spilled honey... And your lips... all wet... as if they had kissed mine, and above all things, you are hidden from everyone, Susana, hidden in the immensity, hidden in the immensity of God, behind his Divine Providence. where I cannot reach you. Not even see you. Where not even my words can reach. El?as! Don Pedro. Invite Bartolom? Sn Juan to live in this house again. Tell him I need him here. It doesn't matter if you have to cheat... I can't find them, don Pedro. I am told that they left Mascota. And some tell me to go there and others tell me to go here, and I... Find them. At any cost. No way they were swallowed by the earth. Don Pedro. I've searched the entire mountain range, Including the corner where Don Bartolom? and his daughter Susana San Juan were hiding. Insist. Not for him. But because of his daughter. For her safeness. And to bring her to live in an inhabited place. Don Pedro. Remember what happened when I found them in the abandoned mines. I told him that you offered to appoint him as administrator. And what said to me?! No answered. Mr. Batolom? always tears up your letters. Outsiders are strange people, don Pedro. Alright, don Pedro. Howdy, do?a Dolores... Howdy, Don Fulgor. Please... My employer, don Pedro P?ramo, wishes to marry you. Forgive my sudden blush, don Fulgor! I never expected don Pedro to notice me. He does not sleep thinking about you. But don Pedro has plenty to choose from. So many beautiful girls abound in Comala. What would they do when they found out? He only thinks of you, Dolores. Only you. Your words give me chills, Don Fulgor. I couldn't even imagine. He is a very private man. Let's set a wedding date for the day after tomorrow. Agreed? It is not too early? I have nothing ready. The trousseaus will have to be ordered. I will write to my sister. No, I'd better send her a messenger, But either way, I won't be ready until April 8th. Today is the first of the month. Yes... Just by day eight, ask him to wait a few days. He would like it to be right now. If it is for the bridal trousseau, we will provide it. Don Pedro's late mother would have wanted you to wear her clothes. The family has that tradition. But there is a problem for these days. Women stuff, you know? I am ashamed to say this to you. I feel my skin color fading. I get the moon. I'm so ashamed. So what. The moon has nothing to do with marriage. The important thing is to love each other. If there is that, the rest doesn't matter. No. But you don't understand me, Don Fulgor... I do. The wedding will be the day after tomorrow. Please excuse me, do?a Dolores. Please help me. Yes, Ma'am. Please excuse me. This will bring everything down sooner. This very night. But whatever, will last at least three days. there's not much to do. Thank you sir for sending me don Pedro! Even if he eventually despises me. Hurry up, Chacha. Don Pedro will be here in a moment. Everything is ready, Damiana. Damiana. Don Pedro. Have a chair. Chacha! Excuse me, don Pedro. Sit down. Fulgor. Here we can speak calmly. Why don't you sit down? I rather stand, Pedro. So be it. But address me with respect, use the "don". Who are you to speak to me with such familiarity? What did Dolores say? Everything is arranged. And fully interested. Father Renter?a wants 60 pesos to overlook the reprimands. He says he would receive them in due course. He also said, that it is necessary to make some repairs to the altar. And that his dining room table is battered. I promised him that a new table would be sent to him. And he also says that you haven't been to church for a long time. And that since your grandmother died, that not even tithes are paid to him. I told him not to worry about it. If you pleased. You didn't ask Dolores for something in advance? No. I didn't dare. It's the truth. She was so happy about the wedding. I didn't want to spoil her enthusiasm. You are such a child, Fulgor. I did not want to sour the moment. Yet you are childish. You're right, don Pedro. Next week you will go with Aldrete. You will ask him to walk the ground. He has invaded the lands of the Half Moon. He did the ground measurements right. I'm positive. Then tell him he was wrong. That it was miscalculated. Destroy terrain boundaries if necessary. And what about the laws? The laws? From now on, we will make the laws for them. My goodness! It will not be the three knocks of San Pascual who comes to warn somebody faithful on his behalf, that the hour of his death has come? That don Pedro... It does not take away his sneakiness. Mid-fifties man, Single. My occupation is administrator. Suitable to follow and to initiate litigation. by proxy and by right. Claims and alleges as follows: Know my accusation against Toribio Alderete for usufruct. I appreciate your coming. Toribio. Aldrete. I know what you're capable of Fulgor. No one can take the man away from you. But not only because of the power behind you, But for yourself. Find out about this. With this paper we are going to wipe us clean, Don Fulgor. Because it will serve no other purpose. So you already know it. Whatever. As far as you are concerned, You did what you were ordered to do. And it was a weight off my mind. Because... I admit that this matter had me worried. Now that I know what it's all about, it makes me laugh. So "usufruct" it is? Shame on your employer for being so ignorant. That bastard! Please... After all... He acted like a man. Oh, Boy! Has the Toribio Alderete matter been settled? The matter is taken care of, don Pedro. There is still the matter of the Fregosos. Leave that for later. Right now I am very busy with my honeymoon. Good night, Gerardo. I have chosen to go to Zayula. There I will settle down. You lawyers have that benefit. You can take your heritage with you everywhere, as long as you don't get your snouts broken. Not that easy, don Pedro. We always create problems for ourselves. It also hurts to leave people like you. And the attentions they have had for one, well... are appreciated. We live, breaking our world every now and then, if you allow me to say this. Where do you want me to leave those papers? You don't. Take them with you. Or what? Don't you plan to continue taking care of my business wherever you go? I appreciate your confidence don Pedro. I sincerely appreciate it. Although I make the caveat that it would be impossible for me, certain irregularities... Let's say... Testimonials that only you should know. And that could lend itself to mismanagement. In case it falls into other hands. The papers are more secure with you, don Pedro. You're right, Gerardo. Leave them here. I will burn those. Papers or no papers, who can dispute my ownership of what I have. Nobody, don Pedro. No one undoubtedly. Excuse me. Go with God, Gerardo. Pardon me, don Pedro? May God be with you. Don Pedro. I am not satisfied with myself. I will gladly continue to handle your affairs. Alright, Gerardo. There are the papers where you left them. I would also like to, don Pedro... You know... Travel expenses, the transfer of... A minimum advance of fees, Some extra. If you are willing, yes? Five hundred. It couldn't be a little bit more. You settle for a thousand? And if there were five? Five what? Five thousand pesos. I don't have that much. You well know that everything is invested in land, animals. You already know this. Take a thousand, I don't think you'll need more. Don Pedro. Your father, Don Lucas. He has always owed me my fees. I expected a large compensation. Worthy. I spared him jail time. At least, eight times! probably more. And the crime that your very son committed... Against that man... What was his name? The one who had the gun put in his hands. And... About those raping... At least how much would that have cost? If things had gone to court. To legal instances. Here's a thousand, Gerardo. And take good care of them because they will not sprout. You're right don Pedro. Dead people do not sprout. Unfortunately. Tomorrow I will return to the Half Moon with do?a Dolores. This house needs to be sold. Alright, don Pedro. What is the problem, Dolores? Help me. Inocencio, please help me. Pedro P?ramo is waiting for me. It's my wedding night! Give me a remedy. For my moon to go down. Tonight you can't stick with any man. This would bring bad luck. You have to help me solve this, Inocencio Osorio. I have to push you. I have to push you. Relieve. Lay down. Lay down! What are you going to do to me? Eat this small mushroom. Eat it! I warn you. I warn you that you will have a slight fever. Your body will warm up. Lust will possess your body. Only then will you get well. And you'll know your future. What are you going to do to me? These herbs. They will drive the evil spirits out of you. Identify your desires. These are your desires. I want don Pedro. I want don Pedro. You will get what you desire! I want don Pedro. I want don Pedro. I want don Pedro. Pedro! I want don Pedro. I want don Pedro. Away, evil spirits! These are your desires. These are your desires. Leave me alone! My body will heal you. I feel the bad spirits leaving! Happiness... you will soon achieve. I will make Pedro P?ramo happy. I will be happy... Yes, you are going to make him happy. But no tonight. You are now cured of your fear! You are now cured of your fear! Yes. You are now cured of your fear! Now, you can soak your body in water very hot water! The moon is wild! The moon is wild! What is happening, Inocencio? Dolores needs you. Tonight she must have no contact with any man! The moon is wild! That guy is a deceiver. You really are sneaky. She needs you. Help her. Eduviges, now I can't! I must not sleep with Pedro P?ramo! The moon is wild! This guy is a deceiver. This is your wedding night. Don't be fooled by that dream salesman. I'm telling you I can't tonight. I can't! Take my place. He won't find out! That cannot be. You must go. Take my place, I'm begging you. Do me that favor. I will pay you with others. Alright, Dolores. I'm going to sleep with Pedro P?ramo. Thank you, Eduviges. Thank you. What do you want, Fulgor? Master! Do you know who lurks around here? Who?! Bartolom? San Juan! Where on earth did this boy get these wiles from? What a woman means after all. Yes, indeed. Please excuse me, don Pedro. Damiana... Damiana. I waited years for her to return. I waited to have it all. Not just something, but everything that can be had. So that we no longer desire anything else. Just hers. Her desire. Why are you sighing? Why are you sighing? I would like to become a vulture and fly to my sister. Say no more, do?a Dolores. You will see your sister right away. Have your suitcases packed. That's all it takes. Don Pedro. She loves her sister more than she loves me. There she will be happy. She is already pissing me off. I don't plan to hurt her for it if that's what you're worried about. But what will they do for a living? May God help them. So long, don Pedro. So long, Dolores. My son will never carry your last name Pedro P?ramo! The illusion made me open the window. When will you be able to sleep, Juan Preciado? Tell me, do?a Eduviges. Someone lives in the Half Moon? No Nobody lives there. And then? Have you ever heard the moaning of a dead man? No, do?a Eduviges. You better hope so, son. You better hope, so. Is that you, do?a Eduviges? What is happening? Are you scared? My name is not Eduviges. I'm Damiana. I heard you were up to here and I came to see you to take you to see your father. You will then be able to rest on the Half Moon. Damiana Cisneros? Are you one of those who live in the Half Moon? I live there. That's why it took me so long to come. My mother told me about a Damiana who took care of me when I was born. So that's you. It's me. I do know you. Since you opened your eyes. The screaming has not left me alone here. Didn't you hear what was happening? Like they were murdering someone. Couldn't you hear it? Some echoes trapped here... Toribio Aldrete was hanged in this house. Then they closed the house until he was dry so that his body would not find rest. I don't know how you got in. When there is no key to open the door. Do?a Eduviges opened the door. She told me it was the only room she had available. Eduviges Diada? That one. Poor Eduviges. her soul must still be in pain. This town is full of echoes. They seem to be enclosed in the hollows of the walls. or beneath the rocks. When walking, You feel like you are being stepped on. You hear crackling. Laughing. Old sounds. As if tired of laughing. Voices already worn by use. All of that you hear. There was a time when I was hearing for many nights the rumor of a party. The sounds reached all the way to the Half Moon I went over to see that great party. I saw this. Nothing. Nobody. Then the noise stopped. And it is that joy tires. So I was not surprised when it ended. As you may see, there are no trees. There were once, because if not.... where all these leaves would come from. Don't panic if you hear echoes. Newest, Juan Preciado. Did my mother also tell you that I was coming? No. By the way, What became of your mother? Passed away. Already dead? What did he die of? I don't know. Sadness, I guess. She sighed a lot. That's a bad thing. Every sigh is like a sip of life from which one gets rid of. So, she passed. Yes. Perhaps you should have known. How should I know? I have not known anything for many years. And then... How did you find me? Are you alive, Damiana? Answer me, Damiana! Damiana! Damiana Cisneros! Damiana! Damiana Cisneros! Damiana Cisneros! Damiana Cisneros! There are towns that taste of misfortune, Susana. and this is one of them. You recognize them when you sip a little of their air Old and numb like everything old. Yesterday you even entertained yourself by watching the clouds and the birds fly by. And you could smell the moss. Here, on the other hand, you will only notice a sour, yellow smell that seems to be coming from everywhere. And this is a wretched town. All muddied with misfortune. The surnames we carry. He has lent us his old house. He has offered us anything we might need. But we should not be grateful. We are unfortunate to live here. There is no salvation here. I sense it. As far as I know, pure evil. That's Pedro P?ramo. So, he wants you, Susana. And you would agree to sleep with him. Yes, Bartolom?. You don't know that he is married and has an infinite number of women. Yes. Bartolom?! Don't call me Bartolom?! I'm your father. And how am I? My daughter! The daughter of Bartolom? San Juan! This is not true! It is not true. What have we done!? Why has our soul rotted? Your mother used to say that we are left with the charity of God. and you denies it, Susana. Why do you deny me as your father? You are insane. Didn't you know? You're insane! Of course I am, Bartolom?. Didn't you know? Your room is ready, Susana. Justina. Do you remember? February. When the wind was blowing in the mornings. From sparrows. And canaries. My mother died then. Do you remember? Hair was beginning to grow on my legs. And in my hands, my breasts trembled warm. Too bad she closed her eyes to daylight. Nobody came to see her... It was better that way. Death... It is not a pleasant thing to share with everyone. Nobody lurks for sorrows. There was a knock at the door, you were to attend, I see people's faces blurred, make them away. They come for the alms for the Gregorian Masses. She left no money. Tell them justina. That she will not get out of purgatory if those masses are not prayed. Who are they to do justice, Justina? You say that I'm crazy. Have some rest, please. You know, Fulgor? That this is the most beautiful woman that has ever been given on earth. Don Pedro. Fulgor. Please. Do not expect other guests. There are no other guests. Susana... The day you left, I understood that I would never see you again. You were leaving a town behind. Which many times you told me, I want it because of you. But I hated for everything else. Even because I born there. I thought: She is never coming back. She is not coming back. Do you remember, Susana? When we were flying kites and you were laughing? No. I don't Remember... To your comeback, Susana. There were hummingbirds. It was their time. You could hear the buzzing of its wings in the jasmine blossoms. When we were kids we used to swim together in the river. I only remember the sea without seagulls. Those birds... what did we call them? 'Ugly beaks' Yeah! They grunted. And they would leave at sunrise. That was not the sea, Susana. It was a river. No, the sea! Don Pedro. Susana talks about the times with her late husband. It makes her forget her loneliness. She lives on with her memory. She was recently widowed. Now I would like to detail everything about the Andr?meda. And make you see the possibilities. If you work conscientiously. I am not interested in your mine, Bartolom?. The only thing I want from you is your daughter. That has been your best work. Accompany the master to his room. Justina... Sit down on the empty chair that my father left. I'm a widow, Justina. I only remember my mother's death, when no one came to see her. For having died of phthisis. Today we have felt the sorrow of another death. I don't remember other still eyes, nor another unmoving heart. Nothing is true, Justina? I never married. How would I be a widow then? I have only slept on an old chest. That always palpitates, lulling my dreams. I'm so tired. Very tired. Good evening. Leave me alone! You stay, Fulgor. Sit down. I came to think I would never find her again. But now I don't feel like losing her again. Tell her father to go and continue exploiting the mines. There, it will be easy to make that old man disappear. In those regions where no one ever goes. Don't you think so? It could be. We need it to be. She has to become an orphan. We are obliged to protect someone. No? I don't see it as difficult. Well, let's get going, Fulgor. On your way! What if she gets to know about it? Who would have to tell her? Tell me, between the two of us, who would tell her? I'm sure no one. Remove the 'I'm sure' from that sentence. Remove it! You will see how, from now on, everything will be fine. Remember all the work to find the Andromeda. We will look after her. I like the idea better. You have a very high level, boss. Like your spirits are getting younger. Don Pedro wants you to return to the Andr?meda right away. So that you can continue to exploit your mines. I like this way better. I'm going to get my daughter right now. No. You will be going alone. With me. It appears to be a human howl! At the same time it does not seem to come from any human being. Justina! Justina! What do you want now, Susana? It's your cat, he has come again! Poor thing you, Justina! Why are you crying? I will tell Pedro that you are very good to me. I won't tell him about the scares your cat gives me. Don't be sad. Your father is dead, Susana! Last night he died. And today they have come to say that nothing can be done. That his body was already buried. That they couldn't bring him here because the road was too long. So, it was him. He came to say goodbye to me. You have been left alone Susana. When I was a child, he made me go down an open hole in a mine, He made me go down and down and down, with a swing that swayed in the depths, with my feet in the air. He told me that I had to find something, next to her. And that I would give him everything he could find. The skeleton crumbled. The jaw came off as if it were made of sugar. It disintegrated, piece by piece. And then, I checked between the toes. I saved juncture after juncture. First, it was the skull, That round shape that It fell apart in my hands. Bartolom? wanted me to look for something else. Money. Gold balls. Then, I lost consciousness for many days. In my mind there was only the cold look of my father. That's why now I'm laughing. I knew it was him Bartolom? San Juan! Father, listen to my confession. Shut up! I cannot forgive your sins. Because of you? No. For the salvation of a soul. That man you don't want to mention his name has broken your church, with your consent. What else can we expect from you, Father? What have you made of God's strength? Being just good is not enough. Sin is not good and to end it you have to be hard and ruthless! I want to believe, That they are all still believers. But it is not you who keeps their faith. They do for superstition. And by fear. I know how difficult our task is in these poor towns where they have us relegated But that gives me the right to tell you that we should not hand over our work to a few who will give you crumbs in exchange for your soul. You put your soul in their hands. What could you do to be better than those who surpass you? No, father. My hands are not clean enough to give you forgiveness. You'll have to go elsewhere. What do you mean, sir? That you will not be able to serve others if you yourself live in sin! Do you suspend my ministries? Maybe you deserve it. I leave it to their judgment. Could you, provisionally let's say... I need to give the Holy Oils and communion. So many people die in this town, sir... Father. Let the dead be judged by God. Sir... Then... Will I not be able to exercise any of my faculties? No. Those are sour fruits, sir. In this soil everything is given. But everything is given with acidity. We are doomed to that. You're right, sir. I have tried to sow everything in Comala. But without achieving it. However, They say that the lands of Comala are Good. It is a pity that they belong to one man. Pedro P?ramo owns this all, isn't? It is God's will. I do not think that the God's will take part in this. Don't you think so, father? Sometimes I have doubted it. But here they recognize it. So you're one of them. I am a man willing to humble. sir. As long as he I have no other need. With his hatred and grudge. He destroyed my Church in pieces. Oh, Lord! Forgive me for bringing to death... the only being he has ever loved. This is going to be my salvation. Or my eternal purgatory. Good bye, father! Bye, my son! God bless you. Padre! Dawn has already been called! But it must be after dawn. Where are you going so early in the morning, Father? Where is the dying man? Did someone die in Contla, father? Me... I'm a walking dead. I can't give up your love, Susana. It's the only thing I have left. I only think of you. Susana. What are you saying? Who are you talking about? You are talking about my Lorenzo? Why I didn't cry? and I refused then in tears to wash away my anguish. God, you don't exist. I asked you to protect him. I just asked so. But you only deal with souls. And what I want from him is his body. Naked and horny with love. Boiling with desire. I miss the trembling of my breasts, and of my arms. My transparent body suspended next to him, My lightweight body, held aloft by his strength. What shall I do now with my lips? Without his mouth to fill them. What shall I do with my sore lips? Lorenzo does not exist, ma'am. I want to see don Pedro! It's very urgent! Why do you want to see him? - I want to talk him! - He is not here. Then, tell him that I come on behalf of Mr. Fulgor! I'm going to look for him. But you must wait a few hours. Tell him it's urgent! What do you want? I need to speak personally to the boss! This is me! What do you want?! Nothing more than this: They have killed Fulgor Serrano! I was going with him. We had gone down the landfill road to find out why there was no water. That's what we were doing. When we saw a crowd of men. They didn't even consider me. But they told Don Fulgor: This lands, were already invaded. and that they were its new owners. Why are you standing there? Go and tell them that I am here for whatever they need! I will do so, boss! Justina. Get out of here, Justina. Pack up and leave. We no longer need you. She really needs me. She is sick and she needs me. Not anymore, Justina. I will stay here to take care of her. Is that you, don Bartolom?? What is happening, Justina? Why are you yelling so much? I haven't been yelling, Susana. You must have been dreaming. I have already told you that I never have dreams. You have no regard for me. I am very sleepy. Last night you didn't let the cat out and he didn't let me sleep. The cat slept with me, between my legs. I was soaking wet and out of pity I let him stay in bed but he didn't make a sound. He did no noise. But he spent the night doing tricks. jumping from my feet to my head. and softly meowing. As if he was hungry. I fed him a good dinner and he didn't leave my side all night. Once again you dream lies, Susana. I tell you he spent the night scaring me with his prancing. Even if your cat is very friendly, I don't want him when I'm asleep. You see visions, Susana, that's what happens. When Pedro arrives I will tell him that I can't stand you anymore. I'll tell him I'm leaving. There will be good people to employ me. Not everyone is a maniac like you, nor do they live torturing. I'm leaving tomorrow. You're not leaving here, damn you! Damn Justina. You're not going anywhere. You won't find anyone who loves you like I do. No. I won't leave, Susana, my child. I won't leave. You know I'm here to take care of you. It doesn't matter if you make me complain. I'll take care of you forever. Just like when you were born. When I held you in my arms. When I taught you to walk. To take those steps that seemed endless. Fulgor. After all, he was not giving much more. He gave everything he had to give. Although he was very helpful to be honest. Don't you think so, father? I think only of Susana. Always locked in her room. Sleeping. Or pretending to sleep. I spent the previous night awake. Looking through the pale candlelight, watching her body move. Her sweaty forehead. Her hands shaking the sheets. Holding the pillow tightly. Since I brought her to live here, I don't remember nights spent by her side. Only these painful nights of endless restlessness. I wonder when this is all going to end. I hope to sometime. Nothing can last that long. There is no memory, no matter how intense, that does not taste good. If only I knew what it is that mistreats her inside. It makes her stir between sleepless nights. That has torn her to shreds. She always pronouncing that name. Lorenzo. Lorenzo. Man who does not exist. Lorenzo is all men, father. Each one she never had in her life. What is the world of this woman? That is one of the things you will never know. P?ramo. Susana San Juan. Is no longer of this world. Is that you, father? This is your father, my child. Your heart is dying of grief. I know you came to tell me that my Lorenzo is dead. That much I already know. Don't get sad. Don't worry about me. I have stored my pain in a safe place. Don't let your heart go out. Let me comfort you with my grief. I have come to comfort you, my child. Then... Bye! Don't get back. I don't need you. Why did you come to see me? You're dead. Mother! Can't you hear me? I am here! In your town. Next to your people. Can't you see me? You sent me to find someone who doesn't exist. What are you doing here? I came to look for. I came to look for my father. And why don't you come in? Aren't you dead? Are you drunk? He is just scared. So much has happened to me. I would rather sleep. We were not sleeping. Who knows? How did he come to be here? I kind of heard him say something about his father. Is he lost? Let's go to sleep. It is not yet dawn. It was a long way to the dawn. Hours... You notice how he rolls. Just as if he were being shaken from the inside. I wouldn't talk, but the sight of him reminds me. About what happened to me the first time you did it. And how it hurt me. And how much I regretted that. From what? How I felt as soon as you did that to me. That even if you don't want to, I knew it was wrongly done. And so far you come to me with that story. Get up and go where you won't disturb! I will. And in passing I will tell that guy to come and sleep here with you. In the place I am going to leave for him. Tell him. I won't. It will scare me. Then go do your business and leave us alone. We have no more. Forgive how little. We are so short of everything. So scarce... Don't worry about me. Do you feel sick? I dunno. I see things and people where you may see nothing. Take that. Take that. It's good for you. It is lily of the valley water. This will lower your fear. How can I get out of here? Where are you going? Anywhere. There are many paths. Where did your husband go? He is not my husband. Is my brother. Although he does not want it to be known. Where did I go? For sure to look for a bighorn calf. Who is out there, lost. At least that's what he told me. I know you are here. Since ever. This is where we were born. You must have known Dolores Preciado. Maybe him. I know little about people. I never go out. Here where you see me, I have been here forever. Well, not so forever. Only since he made me his wife. Since then I have been locked up. Because I'm afraid of being seen. He doesn't want to believe it. But do I really look scary? Look at my face. What do you want me to look at. Can't you see my sin? Those purple spots that cover me from top to bottom. And that's just on the outside. Inside I am all muddy. Who can see you if there is no one here. If you saw the crowd of souls that are loose on the street. As soon as it gets dark they start to come out. Nobody likes to see them. There are so many. And so few of us. that we don't even struggle to pray anymore. For them to stop suffering. Our prayers are not enough for so many. If anything, they would have A word of the Lord's Prayer. And that can't do them any good. Then there are our sins in between. None of those who are still alive. It is free of sin. No one will be able to raise their eyes to heaven. Without feeling them full of shame. And shame does not heal. He is not coming back. I could see it in his eyes. He was waiting for someone to come so he could leave. Come lie down here with me. I am fine here. You'd better get on the bed. There you will be bitten by rats. Look towards that window, do?a Fausta. They always left the light on. No, do?a Angela. I can't see any window. It just went dark. Is there something wrong with the woman in the Half Moon? Those who have been in that house say that the light comes from the room where Pedro Paramo's wife lives, a poor madwoman who is afraid of the dark. Look now! The window still dark. Is this not a bad omen? The Aurinos say, That the crazy ones are not worth the confession. And although they have an impure soul, they are innocent. Only God knows about that. How is the lady doing? Not well, sir. - Is she complaining? - No, sir. She no longer complains about anything. But they say that the dead no longer complain. The lady is lost to everyone. Hasn't Father Renter?a come to see her? Today she should have taken communion. But she must not be in state of grace. State of grace? From God, sir. Don't be silly, Justina. As you say, sir. I am going to give you communion, my daughter. I had a very happy time... Have a look! The light in the window has already been turned on again. My mouth is full of dirt. Yes, father. Don't say, "yes father" Repeat after me what I tell you. What will you tell me? Will you hear my confession again? What's the point? We are in the middle of a confession, Susana. I just came to talk to you. To prepare you for death. I'm going to die? Yes, child. Why then won't you leave me alone? I'll leave you alone, Susana. As you repeat the words I say to you, you will fall asleep. You will feel as if you were lulling yourself to sleep. And as soon as you fall asleep, no one will wake you up. You will not wake up again. Alright, father. I will do as you say. With a mouth full of dirt. I have a mouth full of you... Filled with your mouth. Your lips tight and hard, as if you were sleeping. Covering my lips. I swallow, my wife. I chew worm-ridden lumps that lodge in my throat. And they choke my taste buds. My mouth twists into grimaces. Perforated by the teeth that drill and devour it. The nose softens, The jelly of the eyes, melts... The hairs burn in a single flame. There still more. Sight of God. The soft light of his infinite sky. Last and fleeting glimpse of those condemned to eternal punishment. And not just that. But all combined with an earthly pain. The marrow of our bones turned into fire. Veins in our blood spin fire. Making us part with incredible pain! Never! You've always trodden for the wrath of the Lord. He held me in his arms. Love... My body felt happy on the warmth of the sand. I had my eyes closed. Arms wide open. Legs outstretched. To the sea breeze. And the sea, there... Facing me. Leaving... Leaving traces of foam on my feet. As the tide rises. I was sleeping curled up. Deep inside him. Lost in nothingness. Feeling the flesh open up. Breaking, as if by a nail. Burning. Clean. Strong. Striking hard blows against my flesh. Sinking. Sinking. sinking further, to the scream But I was much more hurt by his death. You are going into the presence of God, and his judgment is cruel to sinners! Go away, Father. Do not be sorry for me. I am at ease. I am very sleepy. Justina! Please go elsewhere to cry. - Mercy! - Mercy! You have been gone a long time, Susana. The light was the same then, as it is now. It was the same poor moonless light. Wrapped in the wind that is blowing now. But there is one lament. I'm here, next to the door. Watching the sunrise and watching you leave. Following the path to heaven. Where the sky began to beat with lights. There was a large moon in the middle of the mountain. My eyes were lost looking at you. Wandering. Soft. Moon-scrubbed; your puffed mouth Moistened. Iridescent with stars. Your body transparent in the night water. It's me, don Pedro. Everybody chooses the same path. Everyone leaves. I think you should sleep. I have forgotten sleep and time. We old people sleep little. Sometimes we hardly doze. But without stopping to think. There was no way to make them understand that it was a mourning, don Pedro. Days of mourning. This town will be filled with goodbyes as well. I will cross my arms and Comala will starve. Susana. You brushed your body against the branches of the paradise... and you carried away with your air its last leaves. Then you disappeared. Susana. A charity! To bury my dead woman! Help me! Pedro P?ramo! Pedro P?ramo! Pedro P?ramo!
