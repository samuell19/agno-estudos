LOTTE ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS A HARIMAO PICTURES PRODUCTION SON Ye-jin KIM Nam-gil Directed by LEE Seok-hoon THE PIRATES Ripped and corrected by - YoungJedi - WIHWA ISLAND ON THE AMROK RIVER, 1388 We must request rewards and give them to our boys, sir. -Jung-geun had a baby and-- -Listen up. We'll be the vanguard. Riches and honor will soon be ours. No matter what, trust me. See? We're all set. At dawn, we will turn back. -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! To overthrow Goryeo… -Aren't we the vanguard? -We'll first attack General Choi Yeong. Vanguard Chief, are you ready? Yes, sir! At your service, sir! -Isn't this treason? -I am the Yi Seong-gye. I will make sure this retreat will be the start of great history. -With you men, I will-- -Excuse me. -Quiet! -It's okay. We're all in this together. Go on and speak. Why aren't we fighting when we're almost there? Haven't you heard? We'll retreat because first, it's hard to cross the river in the rain. Yes, sir. Second, the rainy season will rust our arrows. Yes, sir. Third, if the supply ship does not come, we'll be stuck. Yes, sir. Fourth, it's not courteous for a small country to attack a big one. What? What courtesy in war, sir? -Then, we can bow and fight! -Quiet! It's no place for you to talk! It doesn't make sense! We can't fight because of rain, flood, and bad manners? Is being a traitor courteous? "Go back, overthrow the king, and land big posts!" Isn't that it? Mo Heung-gap! -You disappoint me! -It's disgusting. Screw the country to become rich? I'd rather be a bandit! Sir, let's go! Jung-geun, let's go! You fool! Sir! Don't you want to see your baby? Don't make me pull out my sword. We're all brothers, sir. Jung-geun! Jung-geun. Jung-geun! Wake up! The sword has no courtesy! We're in big trouble! Hurry! What a waste of talent. -Kill him! -Yes, sir! I'm dying! -Here they are! Stop them! -Stop them! Stop them! Hurry! I'm seasick. I'm Soma, the captain of the pirates. Where are the Buddha statues? They're on another ship. They're under the cabin floor! Buddha of mercy. Yeo-wol. If you let them live, they'll be trouble later. Remember. Take the statues! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! -Buddha of mercy. -Nice! The fools are even selling off girls! Don't be scared. We'll send you home. Sister? How dare you call the Chief Mate that? Take me with you. My father sold me off. Pirates are at risk to die any day. That's the same for slaves! I'll cook, clean, and do anything! Sounds like she'll earn her keep. Buddha is sinking! Idiot! Why did you drop it? You should have jumped in! She'll come up! -She did it! -Hurray! Chief Mate! THREE YEARS LATER Black seas, red seas, white seas… The seas are not all blue, sir. So, what was it like sailing from sea to sea? Buddha reached the state of nirvana while traveling. After coming back here to the Yellow Sea, I came to a realization, too. Whether it's the sea or metal, yellow is the best! Now, when was that? We found some Japanese people pirating in our turf. You should have been there. Stop! Aren't you sick of that story? Then what? We agreed to a leaders' duel to avoid further bloodshed. So, we met up by Tsushima Island. Let's just eat! Yeo-wol went out to face this huge, burly guy. Wait. What was his name? Makuraki. Right! Makuraki! However, Yeong-wol beat him with one blow! Then, 500 men attacked at once! It was 5,000 men! Was it that many? There were over 500, for sure. Anyway, we fought off 5,000 men for two weeks until the sea turned blood-red! Damn! So what? We fight like hell, but only the Captain eats meat. All we get is diarrhea from eating stinky fish! Don't talk about poop while we're eating. I heard Captain Soma bought 12 houses. When do we get paid? That's enough. Like it or not, we're brothers. Why don't you attack him? You know we all want it. Overthrow him and become the captain! She's talking like a pirate already! This is what I think. Who asked you? A true pirate should… Damn! -What are you doing? -Stop it! I told you to find another job! What pirate gets seasick? Damned seasickness. It's giving me a hard time. The Pyongyang Merchant's Guild already released a warning. If I don't bring back your heads, they'll have mine! Of course, you should bring results. Would seven pirate heads do, sir? Damn rascal! He'll have us killed? They're useless anyway. -Wait! -Shall we go look? -Clamp! -Yes, sir! -Gray Hair! -Yes, sir! -Sod! -Yes, sir! Poop Sack! Here, sir! -Big Eyes! -Yes, sir! -Seahorse! -Me? Damn! Why did I serve a rotten captain like that? And I'm not fit for the sea anyway. -Tie them up! -Yes, sir! -Captain! Let go! -Captain! You're deserting your brothers? -What are you doing? -The streets are full of fools like them. -What brothers? -Chief Mate! Help! Let go! This is not the way of a pirate! How dare you try to teach me? How presumptuous. Take them, sir. Captain Soma? I want to take her, too. Still, she's the Chief Mate. How about the girl behind her instead? Tie up the girl behind her! Let go! -Back off! I'm a pirate! -Please help me! Sister! Chief Mate! Help! Stop this. -Give the rest of them liquor and meat. -Let go! They'll forget it after some drinks and some laughs. Only the strong will-- You bitch! Captain Soma! Drop your swords! You're so ungrateful. Worse than swine. I'll overthrow you. -Yes! -Yes! Loser! In your dreams! I'll consider the time we spent together. if you surrender, I'll let you live. There are only two ends for a pirate. To become fish food, or… The sea is cold. Throw him a blanket. JOSEON Joseon! It is not only a beautiful name, but it comes from your history. So, it shall be. Also, I am bestowing a new Royal Seal. I command the new country to flourish. Furthermore, serve me by offering 500 maids and 200 eunuchs. Yes, Your Gracious Majesty! Good. This concludes the founding of Joseon. Do you think everything is fine back home? What if there's a different king waiting for us-- Enough! I'm just worried. Think about it. They bestowed posts on restless, rich men. But with no country name or the Royal Seal, they'll think nothing has changed about the new country. You can't rule a country when you're afraid of complaints. -What's that sound? -We're not sure, sir! This place is infested with pirates. Get ready to fight! -Prepare for battle! -Yes, sir! Fire your arrows! It's a baby whale. How can it dare to cross this envoy ship's path? Chase it away! Chase it away! Kill it! Fire the cannons! Fire the cannons! Fire the cannons! There! The baby whale is out! Cannons! Fire! Fire! The Royal Seal! The Royal Seal, sir! Joseon's Royal Seal… Crazy Tiger! Where are you, Crazy Tiger? How insane is he to be called, "Crazy Tiger"? Crazy Tiger! I'm exhausted. Now I'm getting land sickness. Still, it's better than the sea. I can rest under the shades. Help me! This is Chief Crazy Tiger of Mt. Songak! So, you want to be a bandit? Introduce yourself. My name is Cheol-bong, sir. After dozens of battles and decades as a pirate, I was the backbone of pirates who ruled the seas, but I have my reasons to become a bandit. Keep me by your side and put me to good use, for I'm a highly capable man who will make history in the bandit world. Okay, fine. Why did such a capable man turn his back on the sea? What? Because I hate eating fish. I can't stand the fishy smell. -I think I'm more of a meat person. -"Fishy smell"! He's just like me. Were you kicked out? "Kicked out"? No way, sir! Yeah, you were. No, sir! That's ridiculous! Don't lie to him. Tell him the truth! Yes, sir. Okay. I'll tell you the truth. I had riches and fame and lacked nothing as a pirate. But life was just no fun! I felt this hollow emptiness inside. Nothing satisfied that hunger. I wondered why then realized one day. "A man should be a bandit! That's it! A man belongs in the mountains! Let's go!" That's enough! You look a little dumb, but since you've got nowhere to go, I'll take you in. Cheol-bong, you're the 30th in rank. Do your job well. The 30th? There's not even that many here! I'm a competent man. What about all my experience? Rookie, cook us a meal. Young fool! How dare you? -How dare-- -"Young fool"? What in the world happened? My friend. First, have a seat. You fool! A whale swallowed the Royal Seal? Are you making a fool of me? Behead him at once! Your Majesty! Your Majesty. That's what will happen. You're right. A whale swallowed the Royal Seal! It makes no sense, right? How could you let this happen? Still, I brought back the name for our country. What if I lost both of them? Since you recommended me, you'll be at fault, too. We'll just die together. I should have died at sea! Listen carefully. Beware of public sentiment. If people find out about this strange incident, they'll think the heavens are against this new kingdom. So, everything I'm about to say is for Joseon's good. There was no whale. You were attacked by pirates. Your Majesty! Put me to death! You look terrible. What happened to you? I, Han Sang-jil of the Office of Royal Decrees… While bringing the country's new name and Royal Seal back, I was attacked by Goryeo pirates! They stole the Royal Seal! The Royal Seal? -Your Majesty. -And yet… Let go! You came back alive! I attempted to take my life, but I had to bring back the country's name, Your Majesty. We protected it from the attacks of the ferocious rebels and brought it here! He said to call this country "Joseon"? Yes, sir. But the Royal Seal-- -Kill me now, Your Majesty! -Kill us! They must be eradicated! Goryeo bandits and pirates must be rooted out! Silence! Silence, I say! Proclaim our new country as Joseon. Send out troops to root out the bandits and pirates! And find the Royal Seal! Yes, Your Majesty. -As soon as-- -Two weeks! You have two weeks. Understood? -Yes, Your Majesty! -Yes, Your Majesty! I got a great tip. Choi's merchant band is carrying goods with just 20 guards. When Monk gives the signal… Blessing, blessing in the early morning -Rookie! -Yes! That's you! Cut the rope upon his signal. Then, I will… Chief? I fought countless battles. I should be on the front lines, not back here cutting a rope! Just do your job right. It's the rookie's job to cut it. I told him to put me to good use. The blessing is coming The blessing is here Get ready, sir! Buddha's blessing Make way! Not good! "Cut it"? -It's the royal troop! -"Cut it now"? - What? - A huge troop! Don't cut it! -Now? -Yes! Run away! That idiot! Run! What's this? Charge! Come out! Kill them! Goryeo rebels! Chase them! -Chase them! -Chase them! We could all get killed! Spread out and gather at the fort! Spread out! Chief! -He's the chief! -Get him! -He's the chief! -He's the chief! Wait for me, Chief! Wait for me, Chief! -Get the chief! -Get him! Chief! Go! Get lost! He's the chief! -Get the chief! -Chief! Stop calling me, "Chief"! Chief! Wait up! -Get him! -Get him! Let's see. Not that many made it back. At this rate, we'll bump into Yi Seong-gye! I told you not to trust Park. We should just rob passersby. I signaled you to turn back. What were you thinking? Why did we let that fool in? Better luck next time. We can't succeed every time. Succeeding once would be nice! We never do! All we eat is grass or wild boars! It's all right. We know the royal troops. They'll pretend to chase us and run home at sundown. Right, Monk? Nonsense! Chief! Look! -Seize them! -Seize them! I guess the sun is still up. Everyone calm down. Calm down, my foot! Do those fools ever sleep? Chief? Where did he go? Run! Why did I come here? Is he still alive? Do you want to live? One of your men tried to harm the King. Too bad it was before he became the King. Do I just have to catch the whale? Cut it open and take out the Royal Seal. Then, you can have anything in Joseon. But if you fail… It will be hell for you. I've already been to hell, sir. You'll command the naval troops. Enjoy your break time and head out early tomorrow. You said it was urgent. Can he be trusted? I don't trust him, but I do trust his ambition. Are you Captain Yeo-wol? What brings a nobleman like you to the rough seas? A whale. It's over 20 meters long, and has that flag stuck on its back. Bring it to me. I'll do the cutting. I'm not a fisherman, nor do I hunt whales. They're angels of life and death sent by the Sea God. They're intelligent and sacred beings. We're on good terms with the Sea God. Feel free to turn down my offer. But then, I'll have to follow orders to root out you pirates. Do you think it will be easy to arrest us? Probably not. But I'll find your families and slaughter every one of them. I'll burn down every village that ever helped you. I'll execute them all. Hundreds, thousands, until I catch you. -That rascal! -Why are you doing this? Our ships are flat and strong against the wind, but not fast. Even if we find the whale, it will be hard to chase it. But your ship is fast enough to hunt it down. That's the reason. I'll give you ten days. That one-eyed fool looks like he'll eat us alive. -Attack him! -Stay out of this. Why? I'm her right-hand woman! What will you do? They are royal troops. We should do what they ask. How can we catch the whale? We're heading to Byeokrando. That hurts! -What are you looking at? -Leave me alone! Let's go, Monk. -People will think I starve you. -Come on, it's meat! He must be frustrated to be stuck in there. Let's go. Hurry. Your portrait in the wanted poster looks way better than your real face. Stop talking and let's find Park. The peach in the clouds… Don't stop. Keep rubbing. That's it. That's new! I like it! Captain Jang? What do you mean, "Captain"? It's been years since I became a bandit. I heard the news. Is it true that you ran into soldiers? "Ran into"? How dare you sell us off? I mean it! It was a coincidence! Don't you trust me? I have a brilliant tip to get rich. I'll give it to you for thirty rolls of silk. My patience is running out. Twenty rolls! Ten rolls! I'll give it to you for free! No charge! A whale. It swallowed a big ship filled with the Emperor's gold. A fish swallowed it? That's right! The whale swallowed it whole! A fish swallowed an entire ship? The Royal Seal, too! The Royal Seal? You have some nerve for a girl. How dare you interrupt men from doing business? What men? All I see are two mutts… And an old wolf. Such a shame. A beauty with a foul tongue. Who am I talking to? Let's introduce ourselves. I'm the infamous Crazy Tiger of Mt. Songak. Everyone fears my name. I don't know about a tiger, but you're crazy, all right. Go eat some grass. Stop smiling, or I'll split your head in half! Are you a bandit? It must be hard living on grass. Buddha of mercy. We're outnumbered. Greetings. I heard new cannons and weapons will be brought in from Europe and Arabia. Why? Do you want to catch a whale? A whale swallowed the Royal Seal sent by the Emperor of Ming. How blasphemous! Can you get them? There's nothing I can't get! I heard the new country is in total chaos. There's a rumor that the King will oppress Buddhism. Buddha is worth nothing these days. Does this look like Buddha to you? It's just gold in my eyes. Yes, the price-- Look. It's not the King who feeds you, but the sea. And we own the sea. Yes, Captain. I want them by tomorrow. It was about two to four years ago. We came face to face with 120 naval ships at open sea! The rabbit is burning. Did we run? No way! We pirates never run away! We fought 5,000 men for two weeks, day and night, until the sea turned blood-red! That was my 17th pirate battle. The rabbit is burning! Damn it! -What? -It's not that burnt. See? It's just slightly burnt. I'll eat the burnt skin then. Who's there? Who else? It's us. All of you struggled so much following me out. I couldn't even keep my promise to always have liquor on the table. -He promised that? -So, I was thinking… Well… I get it, Chief. I knew this day would come. I was preparing for this, too. Preparing for what? You want us to go our separate ways. No. We've been together way too long. Sit down and listen-- Take care, Chief. -Let's go. -Take care. -Hold on. -What's with you men? -Where can we apply to become pirates? -Don't you get seasick? What's "seasick"? There is a ship filled with treasures. Wait. What about it? The Emperor of Ming sent a ship filled with jewels. So? What about it? It must be a big ship, right? -Of course! It's from the Emperor! -Right. But that ship… How can I explain this? How frustrating! Tell us right away! A fish swallowed the whole ship. Nonsense! You've been a monk for too long! Don't you know when to watch your mouth? How dare you interrupt the Chief with such nonsense? A fish swallowed the ship? Whole? "Whole"? Right! That hurts! Idiot! Go on, Chief. Tell us. What happened to the ship filled with treasure? The ship… was swallowed by a fish. The meat is all burnt, rascal! Why didn't you train him? I'm surrounded by a bunch of idiots! I don't believe this! Ridiculous! You're dead! How can you let it burn? Hold on! Did they say it was a whale? A whale? If it wrecked a ship, it has to be a whale. Right! Yi Seong-gye is going crazy because a whale swallowed the Royal Seal. So you're saying we'll get rich if we just catch the whale? -We could retire for life! -Buddha of mercy. A whale? Do we catch it with a fishing rod or a net? No way! -Nets won't work at all. -Why? -Why? -Why? It's gigantic! How big can it be? It's just a fish. "Just a fish"? This is how big it is? Look! A whale's eye is this big! You liar! I'm serious! Its eye is this big! Okay, if its eye is this big, how big are its teeth? It doesn't have teeth. It eats with its whiskers! Why are you laughing? Cut the nonsense and tell me how to catch it. There's only one way, sir. When it comes up to the surface to take a breath, you fire cannons at it! A fish that breathes outside the water? It's true! It comes up, breathes out, and makes a big splash. Right out of its nose on its back! Water gushes up from there! Its nose is on its back? Yes! Even a monk's patience has a limit! Next, he'll even say whales breastfeed their babies! That's also true! -They even eat seaweed for breastfeeding! -That rascal. I'll kill him! -I give up being a monk! -Stop it. I don't believe this! How can I explain it? You country folks don't understand. But the sea… It's freakishly deep and wide, and it's full of all sorts of things! Some fish even have lights on the head! If thousands of them flash their lights, the sea suddenly lights up! Light! Dark! Light! Dark! There's also flying fish! They're fish with wings. Tens of thousands of them jump from the water and flap their wings! They fly right at you! It's such a sight! I hope they're doing well. That just made me hungry. What? Enough with the jokes. So, we can catch it with a cannon, right? Not just one. You need at least a dozen! Let's go get some cannons! This one. It's a portable cannon for easy use. Bang! And that one. It's the king of all weapons. It's called a rocket. It can strike a pine cone that's 2,000 steps away! That one! Yes! It's called the fog bomb. If you set it off, thick fog forms everywhere and you can't see what's in front of you. Looks like you have a good eye. It came from Russia, traveling thousands of miles through Europe. It's called a grenade bottle. This is as dangerous as it gets. Step back. Load them up. You scared me! Country thief, do you have a death wish? Get out of our way! Are you a pirate? It must be hard trying to catch the fish. Sir! Where is the wagon? Mt. Songak. Crazy Tiger. -Split up! See you later! -Yes, sir! Out of the way! -How does this work? -You have to light it up! Light it up? Move! Out of my way! Stop! Get them! That way! Chun-seop! Run! Faster! That little… -Hello, Lady. I'm-- -Damn you, Crazy Tiger! Throw her off! Throw her off! It's heavy! -Checkmate! -Look out! Be careful! Chief! -I'll take your head first! -Calm down, my Lady! How can I? I almost died because of you! Why you! -What? -Behind you. Fire! Are you dead? That stings! Damn it! Why don't we surrender for now and settle this matter later? Beg for our lives? A pirate should never… -What's that? -What's that? Buddha of mercy. "Jang Sa-jeong." So foolish. If you get hit in your noggin, you'll croak! Don't say that to your chief! Fine. Your royal brains will perish! Hey. Are you guys ready? -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Let's go! To the sea! Fill the cannons by half to put the harpoons inside. Reduce the hole to 630mm. We'll seal the four corners, avoid the currents and sail out to sea. Raise the sail! Buddha of mercy. Look over there. Although we lived as bandits, we weren't cowardly robbers like Yi Seong-gye. He took the country by unjust means, but he'll have to pay to get the Royal Seal from us! In the ocean, there's a whale that will make us rich. Let's go out to sea! -Let's go! -Let's go! Are we not going? How can we catch a whale with this tiny boat? Let's just go! -Stop hitting me! -Quiet! Your Majesty! Although we don't have the Royal Seal, we have declared Joseon our new country, so how about moving the capital? As they say, no one builds a house on a grave. How can the King's palace stand on Goryeo's grave? He is right, Your Majesty. This place is lurking with old Goryeo subjects. It's only right that we build a new capital for Joseon and move. It is only right to do so. But I won't go to the new capital without the Royal Seal! You have five days left. Damn! It didn't work. I thought it would buy us more time. -We just have to trust Mo Heung-gap. -Right. Due to the extermination of the Goryeo rebels, the country reeks of blood! We're also bringing in children to offer as maids and eunuchs. Maybe we don't have to catch the whale, since the government won't pay attention-- One of my men was as talkative as you. I had to pull my sword on him. Keep talking. No, sir. I'll finish loading up the ships with water and supplies. Two rockets, six repeating rifles. Three hundred cannons. We've loaded everything. At last! I'll get a taste of the sea! In two days, you'll have the fastest ship on earth, sir. Sail out tomorrow. If we wait for longer, Yeo-wol will live another day. Yes, sir. Yeo-wol. The sea did not desert me. Chief? Chief? Don't drink that. Drinking seawater will kill you! -What's that? -It's a whale! -Where? -It's a whale! -That's not a whale! -It's a whale! It's a shark! -A great white shark! -Catch it! Help me! Get out of there! You'll get eaten! Bull's-eye! -We caught a whale! -It's not a whale! Yeo-wol is scouring the cost? Yes, Captain. It's only a matter of time before we catch her with this ship. Yeo-wol. Run to the end of Earth. I have the world's fastest ship… Did something just pass us? It can't be. What's that? That's so fast! The cannon! Hurry! -The cannon! -Where? Load it up! -The shell fell out! -Wait! Hurry! Chun-seop! Light it up now! -Don't move! -Quiet! -Hold still! -Light it now! It's lit! Prepare for battle! Load the cannons! Reload! Why did you miss the mark? Buddha of mercy! -Fire! -Fire! You said this ship was the fastest ship in the entire world. Who? Me? It's gotten weaker. -Pay attention, all of you! -Pay attention. The whale must have gone to heaven. Move back! Look! -We caught it! -We caught the whale! We caught the whale! No! It's a shark! That's a shark! A whale's tail doesn't look like this! Wait! It's still alive! It's not a whale? How many times did I tell you? It's a shark! If a whale was a thick snake, a shark would be just a worm! -Hey! -Why, you rascal? Fear makes it seem bigger. At first, it seemed huge like a house. But now I see it's just the size of two cows. Fix the boat and sail out again. What? -The ship exploded! -How do we catch the whale now? Aim carefully! -Let's go catch the whale! -We just have to catch it! Are we going to steal that naval ship? You can't sail a ship that big by yourself. Why steal it when you can't sail it? You'll get all of us killed. I quit. -Let me go. -Get lost! Go where? You're steering the ship. I said I can't steer it alone. Get the boys to help you. Who would listen to him when he's the lowest in rank? They always beat me up. Just let me go. You rascal. Cheol-bong ranks second from now on. -But Chief-- -Quiet. Okay. If you need me that much, Chief, I'll try my best. Pick your men. You. And you! You rascal, you always hit me! How dare you? Chief! He's now second in rank. Treat him well. Listen. Swimming in the sea is different from swimming in a lake. If you try to beat the waves, you'll die! Ride them smoothly like a snake climbing a wall. That's it. Hold! Breathe out! Just remember. You fight it, you're dead! Got it? At sea, they used to call me "Crazy Shark." Listen to me at sea, no matter what! You! Snake Head! Burn all the other ships with Chief so they can't follow us. Got it? Make sure you cooperate and get things done right this time! While you two are doing that, I'll get the rest of the clan and get ready to sail out. Let's live to laugh about this! I forgot one important thing. Buddha of mercy. There's always oil next to the torch. All the ships have them there. Pour the oil on the other ships. Then, come back to our ship and shoot burning arrows at them! Got it. Listen carefully! I'm serious here! You're all bad, but you're the worst listener! Remember and do as I say! We're ready to sail out, sir. Tell all of the soldiers to board the ship except for the minimum forces. Everyone on the ship! We're in trouble! The troops are coming! The naval troops are coming! What now, Sub-Chief? I don't believe this! We can't leave without Chief! Where is he? Commander! There! Look! We're under attack! -Look! Chief is coming! -Get ready to sail! Hurry! Monk, drop the sails! You! Cut the rope! Hurry! Cut it? Who's there? Hurry! Don't come up! Go back! Chief! Get on! Hurry! Move! Jang Sa-jeong! Mo Heung-gap. I never thought this day would come. -Chief! Hurry! -Get on! You're still alive. Did you leave your post for this? I will let you join Jung-geun in hell. Shut up! So? Were you able to change the world by yourself? I have no interest in that. -Chief! -Run! Get on now! -Hurry! -Come on! Chief! Grab the rope! Pull! -Damn! -Damn! I'll be back for your head! How many ships do we have left? Only a few small ones, sir. Send them all out to catch the whale. The whale isn't the problem! With all the naval ships wrecked like that, how can we expect to survive? Listen carefully. We'll say the pirates who stole the Royal Seal attacked us. Although we lost our ships, we fought off the pirates, and retrieved the Royal Seal. Understood? We may find the Seal, but what about the pirates, sir? We'll make them up. This is a pirate village from now on. Treat them like pirates and kill them all! Mommy! There's a mudflat underneath, with seaweed in between. The whale must be roaming here. It's the whale! The one with the flag stuck on it! It really has a flag on its back! -Get the harpoons! -Yes, sir! We're ready! Captain? The order? Why are you hesitating? It's a baby whale. How old does it look? What? I must be going blind. Can't you see? It's a newborn! Everyone's tired. We can't exchange a whale's life for people's lives. Captain! Should I give the order? No. Aim at it. Ready to fire! Who are those rascals? What's on your mind? Out in this vast ocean, a man can stretch without limits. I think the sea suits us. The ship is big, so no one's seasick. Hey! Raise the sail! What's that? That's what you're holding, idiot! -If he really was a pirate, I'd be Buddha! -No! Tie it there! Let's learn quickly and kill him off! How can he be second in rank? -Buddha of mercy. -What's the racket? Chief! Wait! Just a second. I don't get it. There are many whales in this vast sea. How will you find the one who swallowed the Royal Seal? We'll keep catching whales until we get the right one. Yeah! You said it's huge! -How many can there be? -Just one! You stupid, ignorant and hopeless men. You ignorant bandits! Whales aren't like minnows. You can't catch and gut them that easily! What a beauty! You finally got to see it. That's a whale! Its nose is on its back! See? I told you so! Let's see. It must be a female. It's kind of small. That's considered small? Are there bigger ones? Of course. His you-know-what is this thick! -What you-know-what? -Whiskers. They're this thick. Aren't you going to catch it? Catch that? You said it's just a fish. You called it a fish. Remember? Catch it for dinner. Remove its bones and cut its fins. -You rascal! -What's wrong? If it was that big, you should have stopped us! Why did you bring us out to sea? Damn it! I said it was huge a thousand times! You're Rank Ten now! -What? -You're at the bottom now! You big-mouthed fool! You should have drawn the whale's eye bigger! That's Soma! -Soma. -He was alive. I said if you let them live, they'd be trouble! How did you become mere fishermen who stick harpoons in cannons? How is it? This smell of the sea before you die. The sea smells the same. Get him! You even beat 5,000 men! Five thousand was an exaggeration. Let's fight to the death! We've lived long enough! -You're going blind anyway. -What? Don't be foolish! There's no way to stop a cannon. Soma! This is between you and me. I challenge you to a duel. Innocent girl. That's why you're not fit to be a captain. Boys. Bring the ship up close. Captain? There's a ship incoming-- It's a naval ship! A man should eat meat! -Who needs fish? -Right! We're fit for the mountains. -Forget the damn fishy-smelling pirates. -Right! Men are like mountains. Women are like the sea. Buddha lives in the mountains, too. How stupid can the pirates be to float on a ship instead of roaming on the vast land? That's why they are the dumbest of all thieves! Right. Let's go back! Buddha, here we come. My Lady! It's me, Crazy Tiger! Crazy Tiger, that rascal! It's me! That ship is blocking the cannons. Chief? We're in a weird spot here. Now! Attack! Start the fight! -Fight! -Against who? Get them! Attack! I came to help you, my Lady. -My Lady! Help! -Who are you? I'm Crazy Tiger of-- Damn it! This isn't our place to fight. Let's go. Let them fight it out! Don't fight! Please! Just cut his arm! Killing is bad. Just give them a few injuries. Wait. Chief! We're drifting apart! Chief! You've lasted long enough. Captain Soma won! Congratulations, sir! Who are you? I'm the Tiger of Mt. Songak, Jang Sa-jeong. Jang Sa-jeong? That's right. It's a rare occasion to meet like this. How about becoming brothers for life? That's right, sir! Sir? They'll be sent to the naval troops and get executed! That's what you pay for going up against your captain! You abandoned your brothers and got tossed out. And you haven't changed one bit. Are you still hung up on brotherhood after everything I taught you? Naive fools fall victim to those with power. So true, sir! As you can see, we're just travelers passing by. We just came the wrong way. Don't you know it's rude for a bandit to attack a pirate? If you say so… Spare us, sir. You're cute, the way you beg. Beg like him, you wench! Did you forget? There are only two ends for a pirate. To become fish food… or be resurrected as a dragon. There are two ends for bandits, too. Go after money. -Or… -Keep everyone alive. Wait! I'm not ready yet! -Chief! -Captain! Soma at your service, sir. Explain what happened to Yeo-wol. I heard she changed cannons with harpoons. She was chasing whales like a fisherman, Commander. Right before she caught it, I turned her into whale bait. I'll offer you tributes, twice as much as before. How much is your life worth? Since I rule the seas, the price of one whale. If you catch it, you'll live. If you don't, you'll die. -A whale, sir? -I'm taking over this ship. You catch the whale, and I'll cut it open. Got it? Feel free to board my ship, Commander. But please remember this. What? The one who gives orders here can only be me, Soma. Commander. Damn. What are you? A pirate or a bandit? Why is that important at a time like this? -Who cares? -Fool! Pirates are way above petty bandits. What a load of nonsense! Didn't your leader lose the sword fight? At least she didn't beg for her life like yours did! He did not! He's a great thief who once fought with Yi Seong-gye! -Right! -Yi Seong-gye? -Who's that? -Ignorant pirates! That's the king's name. Pirates don't serve Kings. We only serve Captain Yeo-wol, Daughter of the Dragon! -A dragon's daughter? -Yes, the first daughter! Our chief is a father to a tiger! -The eldest father! -Right! Damn! Come here! Don't mix with petty bandits. Come here! Don't mix with loser pirates. Why do you all want me all of a sudden? I don't care! Mountains are for men! The sea is for men! In that case, why is your leader a little lass? "Lass"? -You grass-eating fools! -You anchovy poop! Cut it out! Go to hell! Attack! Hey! You're not asleep, are you? My Lady, shall we go pee? Don't be disgusting. How is peeing disgusting? It's only natural. I need to pee. Cutting off your wrist will solve this. Your Majesty! Goryeo revered Buddhism. Monks conspired with aristocrats to rule local regions. Revere Confucianism, oppress Buddhism, and redirect the riches into the palace. Thus, set up a firm basis to your kingdom, Your Majesty! But I have no Royal Seal to stamp such a decree. -I'm afraid I have to say-- -If you're afraid, don't speak! Two days. We only have two days left. Why do they bring up other things instead of finding the Royal Seal? Just like any wild animals, whales stay on the same migratory routes. Two days are enough to catch it. I heard it's gigantic. Won't it be hard? We'll attack the baby whale, sir. The mother whale never leaves its baby. It will be as easy as pie. What will you do with her? Whales are angels sent by the Sea God. Catching one would anger the Sea God. Too bad for you, but she'll be sacrificed. If you came to me then, you wouldn't be here. I should have killed you then. You bold wench. What's that bell? My mom gave it to me. She said it was all she had. Where is she? She's dead. -The soldiers killed her. -Why? Because my father was a pirate. My mother was a diver. That's why I can't stand soldiers like you. It's been years since I became a bandit. Did you commit a crime? I did. I failed to protect my brothers and country. Do we even have a country to protect? Kings and aristocrats are the first to run away when enemies attack. They offer children to become maids or eunuchs and extort the people for more taxes. Rather than defending a country like that, I'd give my life to protect someone I love. I agree with you. That's why I want to catch the whale. I can't live in hiding forever. I want a happy life with a family. Are you married? I'm a bachelor. That's why we share an unbreakable bond. You're really asking for it. I'm not joking, my Lady. Won't you be that special person in my life? Your face turned red. It's from the fire. Let's go for a swim. Is it urgent? Let's go. Wonder why the sea is warm. How dare a petty thief like you mock the pirate captain? "A petty thief"? They're offering 20 silver coins on my arrest. There are 50 on mine, more than twice as much. The reward money isn't important. It's the achievements that count. Look. This was from beheading a Yuan general. This was from killing a Vietnamese pirate head. I killed 500 Ming soldiers on my own. I fought off 5,000 pirates by Tsushima Island. I even survived an attack from a tiger! See? Have you ever heard of a dragon? What do you know about dragons? A dragon bit me, but… Shocked? Look! The heart of wisdom I thought I was going to die all by myself. What happened to the rest? Goryeo rebels Bang, Yeo, Gwak, Oh, Gil… And the rest of you. -"You're the people of this country. -So damn unlucky! You shall serve the king. -Respect your parents. -I shouldn't have become a bandit. -Joseon has a bright future. -Will I die like this? Have faith and pride in it and unite with others to work diligently…" Why is this so long? "To create new history. -Chief? -On this soil…" What was that? What was that? -What? -"What?" -What did I do? -"What did I do?" -Quiet. -Why? -"Why?" -So what? "So what?" -But-- -Quiet! I just said my legs hurt! What's wrong with that? Everyone else is sitting on a flat surface. I'm sitting on a big bump! It hurts! Just kill me! I have to pee! I apologize on his behalf. Don't apologize! Can't I say it hurts? -Quiet! -You be quiet! -What? -Chief. -What? "Thief"? -"Chief." Have you lost your minds? Soldiers! What are you waiting for? Kill the rebels immediately! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Cut mine too! Captain! Chief! Over here! Free me! Chief! Captain! What about me? Stay back! Soldiers! Where is the girl? I was wondering where you went. So you became a bandit. I don't know what to say. I ran off without a word. You'll always be our brother. No matter where you go, be a good thief. Hop on. We need to fight. Are you planning to attack Soma with this number of soldiers? Leave the sea to us and go back to the mountains. Please reconsider. Come to the mountains with me. Let's live there happily ever after. You're really testing my manners. Here's my final offer. If you beg me to stay, I'll stay. If you beg to come along, I'll take you in. If you mock a pirate, this is what happens. We'll attack Soma and rescue Heuk-myo. Look. The color of the sea tells us where the whale is. The clouds are low. We should turn back! I said whales are angels sent by the Sea God. Did you think they're easy to catch? Very well, sir! Come up to the surface. There! It's the whale! Full speed to the port! Mommy! It was the naval troops! They framed the village as the pirates' hideout. They killed all the men and took the children. Do you mean Mo's troops did this? There's no end to that rascal's greed. I must go kill that devil myself. -Go where? -Back to the sea! Not again! I couldn't save the world. But a man must protect the one he loves. Why did you make me get off the ship then? I came all the way back here, only to go back. Damn! Cheol-bong! You're second in rank. Let's go, Chief! Hurry! Chief! Chief! What about me? -Stop the ship! -Go after it! -No! Stop! -After it! Commander! The whale is getting away! Only I, Soma, can give orders on this ship! A baby whale can't hold its breath for long. It will come up soon. -Stop the ship and wait! -Yes, sir! There! There's the whale! Turn to starboard! Turn to starboard! -Go right! -Go right! Get the baby, not the mother! Aim at the baby! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Come closer! Fire! Fire! Pull the rope! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Lure the mother whale! Fire! Stop! Listen carefully! If we don't kill it in one blow, it will get us! Stay alert! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Do you think you can destroy my ship? Come closer, Angel of the Sea God! Come closer! -Fire! -Fire! Now! Throw the grenades! It's a waterspout! A great storm is coming, sir. Whales truly are sacred beings. -Throw the girl in as an offering! -Yes, sir! Throw the harpoons! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Let's pull the whale back to land! Hurry! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Commander! I give the orders here-- So, you'll take all the credit? You're smarter than I thought. I'm much smarter. -Show them! -Yes, sir! If we light the wick linked to the explosives' den, we'll all blow up and become fish food. Don't forget. We share the same fate on the same ship. I'm not going down with you. Go ahead and try. You don't have the nerve. Do you think you're man enough? The dragon. It resurrected! Sister. Let's go home now. Are you okay? Guard the whale! Don't lose it! I will kill that wench. A mere soldier can't kill a pirate like her. -Fire! -Fire! Sister! -Get in there! -You first! -You first! -You first! There are only two ways for a bandit! Go after money, or go after love! We'll talk about that later. You rascals! One of us won't be setting foot on land today. That won't be me. Thanks, petty bandit. Loser, you owe me. Captain Yeo-wol! Yeo-wol! -You hopeless freak! -Chief! Let's get this over with! I shouldn't have taken you in back then. Run for your life. This ship will explode soon. This is the last favor I can give you. Hurry. Hurry! Everyone escape! This ship will explode! -Hurry! -The ship will explode! -Get off! -Escape! Go to hell and apologize to Jung-geun. Jump! Commander! I said, same ship, same fate! I'm Jang Sa-jeong. Do you remember me? What country do I belong to? Since Ming gave the name of Joseon, am I a citizen of Ming? I don't want to belong to such a country. A whale swallowing the Royal Seal was Heaven's warning against ruling under Ming's influence. Even a whale risks its life to save its baby! How can a king sacrifice his people to find a seal given by Ming? Think about what kind of world you will build. If you create a country truly for the people, I, too, will uphold you as King. A whale swallowed the Royal Seal? Forgive us, Your Majesty! You fools! Send home all the children who were caught to be offered to Ming! Your Majesty! Ming demands them. Quiet! Han Sang-jil, go to Ming at once! -Sir? -Go there and renegotiate! If you fail, I'll send your children off as maids and eunuchs! Understood? Yes, Your Majesty! I should have died at sea. Hey! -You need to let go of it! -You told me to pull earlier! What's so hard to understand? The wind's blowing this way! -Stop confusing us. -You do it! When will they get it right? I should have taken his life back in the mountains. Just say you should have killed him. I should leave this ship soon. Ripped and corrected by - YoungJedi -
