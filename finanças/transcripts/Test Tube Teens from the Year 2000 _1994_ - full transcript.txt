I've been briefed on the operation, but sir... I ask you to reconsider the position where you stop the train. Officer Kwon!! Stop!! Cunningly A promise is a promise. Give me that. You are so cruel But this is an emergency. Come on, give me a break. Promises and laws are even more important during crises. Let me make this clear. Don't smoke unless I light it. Okay? Here. I don't need a light... That's the best location for the operation. It's the worst location for the people on the train. Some collateral damage is unavoidable. But a little more caution can minimize the damage. You saw what that maniac did!! If you stop the train in that dark tunnel, over 1,000 passengers will pour out. And that location is where tracks going both ways cross each other. There'll be bullets flying beside 22,000 volts of electricity. too many rail system and happen gun fight The moment the train stops, there'll be huge chaos. Look, there's no time... If you don't want an even bigger crisis please reconsider. Officer Kwon, just do it! Jay! We're getting ready to move in. The train will stop in the tunnel soon. Make sure the passengers don't get off the train!! They must stay in the train no matter what, got that? Is The ATS station remote ready? Yes, sir! - Current speed? - Passing 120km/h, sir. Good. ATS remote ready!! 1 kilometer to go, sir. Release ATS hold. Distance? D-800! 700! 600! 500! 300! Now! The train stopped!! Get out!! No! It's dangerous, don't get out!! 7 103 is crossing to the track on the opposite side!! ATS station to manual. - Don't let 7 103 go!! - Hold!! It's impossible. Interlock cut the high voltage supply unit! Impossible either because the train is going the wrong way!! 7345, 7238, evacuation to track 49 complete. The opposite 7 423 can't switch to track 56. There isn't enough track. Sir!! - With This speed, there'll collide - There're going to collide, sir! - Increase speed for train 7 423 - Sir?!! Tell him to increase speed. Now! Open The emergency Track at Hak Station Yes, sir! If it gets there first, they can bypass each other. Close the track as soon as 7 423 enters it then 7 103 will slip through. There's no other way. As long as 7 423 gets there first... It's all a matter of timing. Open the tracks just for a moment and close, just like you do every day. 7 423, increase speed!! You think you can stop me? You think you can beat me? Think? I don't think. This is plain crazy!! Yeah, it's crazy. Then you stop me. Go ahead, kill me!! Go faster!! Come on!!! I'm about to have a heart attack!! Stop yelling at me!! So long, boy. Now!! You listening, old man? I'm sure you're disappointed it failed. Did you think the Bishop you raised would go down that easily? You're the target today. This is the last order from the Rhodes Team. My last assignment. The Rhodes Team carried out covert government operations. The International Civil Rights Committee protested the team, so Minister Song axed it and had all the agents killed. They even killed the families to hush it up. If word gets out, he's finished. This is serious stuff. You asked for me? How's it going? - So, what is it you have to say to me? - Say? Yeah, I have something to say. While I was out killing people for your government, you killed my wife behind my back. You killed my comrades. And you ignored my warning today. Watch!! Switch this train to track 72 at the next intersection. Now this train runs opposite rail If that train gets on track 72, it'll head for Jamsil Bridge. You may not know it, but that bridge is under construction. Entering at that speed will cause the bridge to collapse!! Interesting! Only one thing can save the passengers in this train. The old man's life for the train. If he really loves the people, like he always claims then he should give up his life to save theirs. Is it you, Jay? It's really you, not a ghost? You're like Lazarus! Back from the dead... You are unbelievable. So I... Where's the train right now? T told them to turn and get on line 2... So now it's on an emergency track near Gunja Station. Things are crazy around here. If the train makes it to Jamsil Bridge, everyone will die... but that's where it's going right now. Could you put Officer Kwon on? Of course, Jay. The subway system was meant to be used as shelters as well. Tracks are like arteries with capillaries connecting them. 1 kilometer ahead of you is E753. If you follow that passage way, you'll come to the end of Track 72. How did the police become so helpless... unable to stop one man? This is the best that Korea's finest can offer? Finest, my ass! According to emergency situation principles, all outsiders and phone calls are temporarily restricted. What are you doing? Sir!! I'm just following orders. That's too far. How about here? No. Electricity is already full. How about this way to Track 59? That's only possible after the train passes Gunja depot. Is there no way for the train to cross the bridge? 7 103 is moving at 1 40km/h. Sir... At that speed, it will be as damaging as ten trains. Even a regular bridge would... Collapse. No! We have to stop it! Find a way!! - Weight? - Yes, The weight. What if reducing the weight of the train since we can't reduce speed? Yes!! That's it!! Where the hell have you been, pig!! Innocent citizens are dying here. What the hell are the police doing? Letting that bastard run around. You'll see three black power cables. First, you release the connector on the right. Hey, Energizer Bunny! Jay. Hurry up. Use your foot to... Oh, excuse me... Stop the train now. Stop, right now! Sit down! That's enough Stop the train Shit, there's no way That's right. Shit, I'm not going to die. Fuck, little more... Great! I salute such courage!! Try to overpower me. Stop me if you can. But the first one to move dies. Who wants to be first? You? Or You? How about you? Then pull the lever now on the connecting mount. - Or you? - Stop the train!! Yes!! Come on! Jump! You made it! I have an appointment over there... My girlfriend's waiting too. Wait, fuck! I should be over there! Not here! Go ahead and pull the trigger. That'll be the end for you, too... You have a nine lives, boy... I've got an appointment to kick your ass. Emergency brakes only work from inside the train. We have Jay. The best way to catch a crazy bastard is... ...to send a crazy bastard. Now watch! Stop it!! Go ahead, shoot! - Shoot! - Damm, shoot! - Shoot! - Shoot! Shoot! Novice! This isn't the end, boy. Kay, Kay, Kay. Kay, Kay. Wake up, Kay. Come on, wake up... Wake up, will you? Kay, wake up, please. What's all this? Why aren't we stopping? Is there a problem or something? We need to check - the steamand oil pressure first. - Find the brakes! We need his help Try it again! Shit, try again, please Why this isn't open? What are you doing? There are two emergency brakes: steam and oil pressurized. But I think both have blown out. Now we start all over from the top. Get the same type of train as 7 103 and have it ready at the depot. Call up manufacturers and working-level personnel. Call the electricity design team, too! We'll try everything, no matter how remote the chances are. You fucking cop! What the hell are you doing, not saving them? Innocent citizens are dying here!! but You're not innocent. Stupid fuck! Sir! Here's the list of 27 confirmed passengers and... Are you hurt anywhere? No... I'm okay. you hear that? Yeah. I hear it. Don't worry. I promise I'll save you. I love you, honey. not embarrassed to say so now? I do love you... I think Bishop's files are... still inside the train. Officer Kwon. Can I talk to you for a minute? At this rate, the train will go straight toward Dang Power Plant. What do you think? This is no longer simply a matter of the passengers on the train. Remember the gas explosion in Ahyeon districit before? If the 7 103 runs into the power plant like T intended, we'll have an explosion a hundred times bigger. So... What would you do if you were me? A long time ago, someone was trapped under a fallen building. He tried and tried to escape then gave up in despair. Suddenly, he remembered the candy he used to eat with his sweetheart. He survived by thinking about how sweet it was. Right. Everyone has one memory they can't forget. Life's not that complicated. One sweet memory's enough. So are you saying that you want to send them to their deaths? It's a sacrifice to prevent an even bigger tragedy. You can call it a sacrifice only when they choose to. The result is obvious. What else can we do? The important thing is, they're alive and waiting to be rescued. Then you have a realistic alternative? Actually, I'm curious. What's the real reason you want those people dead? Is there someone on the train that has to die? Or is there something secret - that needs to be covered up? is that it? - Officer Kwon!! No matter what reasons there are, I can never put them into deaths. You've done a good job. That'll do!! I'm in charge of the controls now. What's 7 103's current location? 3 kilometers into Track 28, Sir. Good. Prepare to switch to spare Track 55 in Sector C. Sir!? But it's under construction. I am aware of it. We sacrifice them to prevent an even bigger tragedy. How far is it to the transfer point? Who's in charge of track transfers? Answer me!! Put the man on! I'll do it. I'm in charge of track transfers. Even if it means I'm sending myself to hell, I'll do it. Transfer point standby... Aye transfer stanby... Standby. 7 103 track transfer countdown. 5! 4! 3! 2! God forgive us... 1! This is a sin... Switch!! Switch!! Even if... Even if something happens... I want you to live longer than me. Can you hear me, Hangmo? Do you copy? Can you hear me, Hangmo? We have no other choice. This is our last resort. Put Detective Jay through. I'll do it, sir. We couldn't stop the train by cutting the main power because of the explosives in the control room. But we can disconnect the first car and send it forward and then stop the other disconnected cars by cutting the power Then what about the bomb? The first car will continue to move, separating from the other cars. Meanwhile, someone has to stay to hold the electric condenser so that the bomb won't detect our cutting the power supply. But when the condenser runs out of power... It explodes. Boom! What are you doing? Can they stop it? How the fuck would I know? Just shut up and watch. Fuck. Shit I don't have a light. Kay. Would you strike a light? Jay!! Are you listening? You crazy son-of-a-bitch! Think you're some hero or what? Why should you do it? You want to get yourself killed? You're some piece of work! At times like this, just play dumb. That's how you're supposed to live, you fool... Call everyone there together and just pick someone. No, pull straws!! Draw! You listening? Are you listening to me? What the hell are you doing? Who the fuck are you? You're just sitting there talking idle, you shitheads! While he's the one who has to die. A detective is your patsy? Why don't YOU go and do it!! Do you have any idea what the hell you're doing now? Yeah! I know! I know that you're sending them to die to save your ass. And now my boy is giving up his life to save all the people. The Prime Minister or whoever is the bastard that deserves to die! I know everything, so what? What?!!! We know, too. Saving those passengers is the last thing we can do. And we know we need our Officer Kwon now. Officer Kwon! We've got 12 kilometers left in Sector C. Please give me an order. Aye. Check the shortest safe distance and mark the transfer point. Main power cut-off standby. No! You can't go. You've done enough. I won't let you. Send someone else! - Kay... - Don't call my name. I don't want to hear it. Stay alive first and we'll talk. Come on. I'm not letting you go. You can't go. Don't go? Huh? Don't do this! Please... Don't leave me alone here!! Somebody stop him!! Stop him! Please... Make him stop! The first car separated! Main power cut-off standby. Aye. Main power cut-off! Cut off. Didn't I tell you? Sometimes... there's a train that nobody can stop... Fuck! I'm alive! The reason I was able to stay strong was this secret memory chip that T had. This secret memory chip I told myself I would protect it no matter what!! I would reveal the corruption of the people in power. I would make the truth be known! If I didn't have this idea... In the end, everything fades. And all that's left are memories. Life's not that complicated. His faint smile that he showed me... That one sweet memory would be enough...
