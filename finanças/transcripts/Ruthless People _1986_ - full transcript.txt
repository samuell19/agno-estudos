SO...WHEN DO I GET OUT OF HERE? AS SOON AS MR. STONE PAYS THE RANSOM. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? WHAT'S THE RANSOM? IT--IT WAS $500,000. THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM. HE COMPLAINED. HE COMPLAINED? AND THEN WE DROPPED OUR PRICE TO $50,000. YEAH? HE DIDN'T PAY. HE DIDN'T PAY? SO NOW WHAT? SO NOW WE'RE DROPPING OUR PRICE AGAIN TO $10,000. DO I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY? I'M BEING MARKED DOWN?

ALTHOUGH IT'S A CAPITAL CRIME, THE ACCUSED IS AN UPSTANDING MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY, A RESPONSIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN, AND HAS NEVER BEFORE POSED A THREAT TO SOCIETY. BAIL WILL BE GRANTED AND SET AT, UM... $700,000. [BANG] YOU WANT TO TRY FOR A REDUCTION? NO. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. THAT FILTHY SLUG. THAT SCREECHING WITCH. THAT PASTY-FACED TROLL. THE JUDGE? MY WIFE. I GOT TO GET HER BACK. SANDY? KENNY? IT'S OVER. SAM ISN'T GOING TO PAY THE RANSOM. I'M NO CRIMINAL. I CAN'T EVEN SELL RETAIL... AND THAT'S LEGAL. WE GOT TO GET PACKING AND GET OUT. I'VE GOT SOME VERY INTERESTING NEWS FOR YOU. I AM THE NEW RISING STAR IN HIGH FASHION! LET'S GET A GRIP ON OURSELVES. WE'RE GOING TO MEXICO. DOES THAT MEAN WE LET BARBARA GO? WE'RE NOT TAKING HER WITH US. I'VE ALREADY LET HER GO. WHAT? YOU LET HER GO? OH, MY GOD! YOU LET HER RUN OUT? YEAH! OH, MY GOD! SHE KNOWS WHERE WE LIVE. THE POLICE WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE! NO. SHE REALLY LIKES US NOW. I SHOWED HER MY GOWNS. SHE LOVES THEM! WE'RE ALL GOING INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER. WE'LL OPEN OUR FALL LINE IN PARIS. SHE REALLY, TRULY LOVES ME! SHE CAN BE TRUSTED! SHE'S CHANGED! CHANGED? DID YOU PERFORM AN EXORCISM? KEN, SHE LOST NEARLY 20 POUNDS. YOU HAD TO BE THERE. IT WAS A SPECIAL MOMENT. [KNOCK AT DOOR] I'M SURPRISED THEY KNOCKED. OH! GOOD AFTERNOON. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS MAN. HE WAS SIGHTED IN THE AREA A FEW WEEKS AGO. HE'S PSYCHOTIC AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. HE'S KILLED SIX PEOPLE. I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! MY WIFE, SHE'S... LATE FOR WORK. DOESN'T LOOK FAMILIAR. KEEP THIS AND GIVE US A CALL IF YOU DO SEE HIM. DON'T TRY TO SUBDUE HIM. HE'S EXTREMELY VIOLENT. HE LOOKS IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, OFFICER. SANDY! IT'S OK! IT'S OK! THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. I'LL GET THE OTHER SUITCASE FROM THE BASEMENT. AAH! HELLO? HELLO? ANYBODY HOME? OH, HELLO. ARE YOU A FRIEND OF KEN AND SANDY'S? YOU... LOOK LIKE MY MOTHER. I HATE MY MOTHER. OOH. NO. OOH. YOU... YOU LOOK JUST LIKE MY FATHER. I HATE MY FATHER! AAH! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? OH, HONEY, DON'T TOUCH HIM! OH, MY GOD. WHAT? IT'S THE BEDROOM KILLER. HE TOLD ME I LOOKED LIKE HIS MOTHER. HE HATES HIS MOTHER. HE'S DEAD. SO, IF I LOOK LIKE HIS MOTHER, AND YOU LOOK LIKE HIS FATHER, THIS IS WHAT OUR SON WOULD LOOK LIKE. PRETTY STRONG ARGUMENT FOR BIRTH CONTROL. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? BARBARA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I GOT IT. I TELL YOU, I'VE GOT IT! LISTEN TO THIS. SAM ARRIVES ON A MOTORCYCLE WEARING SHORTS. NO SHOES. NO SHIRT. NOTHING. MAYBE JUST A JOCKSTRAP. THEN WE SEND HIM ALL OVER TOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOT, SUNNY DAY. SAM BURNS EASILY. HE'LL BE BRIGHT RED IN NO TIME. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. THEN HE COVERS HIMSELF WITH HONEY AND GOES TO A BEE FARM. THE BEES GO NUTS. I DON'T THINK SHE MEANS IT. THEN WE WATCH WHILE THEY STING HIM TO DEATH. BARBARA, DON'T WE WANT A PUNISHMENT THAT WILL LAST? MY GOD, HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEEING THIS WOMAN FOR YEARS. CASTRATE HIM! I WANT TO CASTRATE HIM. WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF WE STRUCK AT HIS CORE? HIS REASON FOR LIVING? WHAT WOULD THAT BE? HIS TESTICLES. WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT SAM'S TOTAL WORTH WOULD BE? NOT JUST THE BIG STUFF. THE LITTLE STUFF, TOO. YEAH, I THINK SO. GOOD. I WANT YOU TO WRITE IT DOWN IN PLENTY OF DETAIL. FIRE UP THE STOVE. GET THE TOFU BURGERS. WE'RE CALLING SAM. MY TUX. MY SILK TUX. ET TU, ADOLPH? ET TU? [WHINING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] HELLO?

WHERE'D YOU GET A FIGURE LIKE THAT? YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION A LIT CIGARETTE CAN PROVIDE. [SIZZLING] AAH! WHAT ELSE? SHH. HE'S GOT RARE GEMS IN A SAFE. SAM, FORGIVE ME.

NOW THERE'S THE FOUR ONE-CARAT DIAMONDS IN THE SAFE. YOU INHUMAN SLIME! AFTER HIS RELEASE, MR. STONE CONTINUED TO DENY THE CHARGES. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY INSISTS THERE'S OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE. OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE IS RIGHT. WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT? HOW COULD THEY LET HIM GO? HELLO? HELLO. IT'S ME AGAIN. I SEE SAM STONE'S BEEN RELEASED. IT'S NOT EASY KEEPING A MAN IN JAIL WITH THESE LIBERAL COURTS. A MAN IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. HOW DO YOU THINK THESE COURTS WOULD FEEL IF I GAVE THAT TAPE TO THE MEDIA? OH, MY...GOD. YEAH. THEY'D GO CRAZY FOR IT. THEY LOVE TO SHOW SICK STUFF LIKE THAT. IT'D PROBABLY BE ON NATIONAL TV 24 HOURS A DAY FOR WEEKS. I BET THAT'D GET A REACTION. PLEASE, DON'T DO THAT! WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF COMPASSION? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO VICIOUS? VICIOUS? HAVE YOU SEEN THAT TAPE? COME ON, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? IT'S JUST A LONELY MAN WHO WANTED A LITTLE EXCITEMENT. THAT KIND OF THING HAPPENS EVERY DAY. EVERYBODY DOES IT! I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT. MEN GET THE URGE. WE'RE ONLY HUMAN! YOU'RE SICK! HELLO? DON'T HANG UP ON ME, PLEASE! SO WHAT DID HE SAY? SOMETHING STRANGE IS HAPPENING HERE. EITHER THE CHIEF IS A COMPLETE MORON-- AND COMPLETE MORONS ARE RARE-- OR HE'S PLAYING GAMES WITH ME. WE BETTER FIND SOMEPLACE WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT THAT TAPE. SHALL WE LOOK IN SARA'S ROOM? THIS IS PERFECT. IT IS? GIVE ME THE TAPE. I'VE GOT 10 MINUTES TO GET TO THE RADIO STATION. OK. EASY TO WEAR, HARD TO RESIST. OH! OH! OH! OH! OH! OHHH! YOU IDIOT! THIS ISN'T SAM! AND HE ISN'T KILLING HER. THAT'S MY HUSBAND! BARBARA REALLY WAS KIDNAPPED. SHE REALLY WAS KIDNAPPED! PLEASE BELIEVE ME! YOU GOT TO BE THERE! THEY'RE COMING THIS TIME FOR SURE! I THINK THE DELI'S USING A DIFFERENT MUSTARD. LAST TIME, IT WAS TANGIER-- I'M PLEADING FOR MY LIFE, AND YOU'RE DISCUSSING THE INCONSISTENCIES OF LUNCH MEAT CONDIMENTS! HAVEN'T YOU HEARD A WORD I'VE SAID? AAH! SINCE THE HOUSE IS IN YOUR WIFE'S NAME, AS WELL AS HER OTHER 15 MILLION IN ASSETS, YOU'RE NOT LEGALLY ENTITLED TO IT WHILE SHE'S ALIVE. HOWEVER, YOU'VE GOT A MILLION TWO BUILT UP IN EQUITY IN YOUR BUSINESS, ANOTHER 350,000 IN YOUR PENSION PLAN. YOU CAN USE THAT AS COLLATERAL. ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT! [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO? SAM?
