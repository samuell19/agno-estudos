(ominous music) - Hey man, get a load of this chick. - [Man On Right] Leave her alone. You know what the Major said about the women. - The hell with the Major, I just wanna check her out. - Don't make a fool of yourself. - Oh really, mister legionnaire? Watch this. - Manny, get back here. - Hey man, just back off, back off. - Idiot. - Hey mama. Need a lift into town? - No, thank you, I have someone meeting me. - Me and my friend over there, we was just heading in a few and thought maybe you... - I said no, thank you. - Hey, how'd it go Romeo? - I don't want any shit outta you! Let's go. - Would you like to buy some fresh bread? I just baked it myself. - Hey lady, go peddle your shit somewhere else. - Ma'am are you alright? - Yes, thank you, thank you. - [Young Woman] Let me help. - Thank you. - Come over here, come over here and sit down. - Thank you, you're very kind, very kind. Are you new around here? - No ma'am I just arrived on a bus. - We don't have many visitors around here. - I'm not visiting, I came here to work for the summer. - Oh, what do you do? - I'm a writer. - Oh, how exciting, what are you going to write about? - Well actually I'm gonna write a book about my father, Colonel Weston Davenport. He was raised in this area. - I know about him, he died about 10 years ago. - It's almost been 15 years. Are you sure you're alright? - [Old Woman] Oh yes, I'm fine. - I wonder where Mr. Lester is. - [Old Woman] Mr. John Lester? - He's supposed to pick me up at 3 o'clock. - [Old Woman] There he is now. - Will you be alright? - Oh yes, I hope to see you again. - You take care, okay? - Thank you. - [Young Woman] Mr. Lester? - Yes, Miss Davenport. - Nice to meet you. - Sorry I'm late. - Don't worry about it, but I am anxious to see the cabin. - Okay, I think we can probably see it best from right over here. That's your cabin right, right down there. - God, it's beautiful. Can we go look at it? - We surely can. This is the police station, my brother's a policeman there, any problem he can be over in half an hour. - I love it.

I'll be back, Tina, I'll be back to see you. - [Voiceover] Sheriff, we got an APB from Creekhead County, two male fugitives, Caucasian, one short with black hair, one tall, 6'4", blonde. Both considered extremely dangerous, believed to be implicated in the... (door slams) (dramatic music) - Well, what's this? - We were just telling war stories. - Yeah, well let's can the war stories. Those are things of the past. This place is for the future. - [Voiceover] Come on, Major, we're just killing a little time. - [Major] What happened to the girl? - I blew her brains out. - Why, didn't she talk? - Hell yeah she talked! Problem was none of us spoke Vietnamese. (laughter) - About through jakin'? Okay, you and Don and the kid go down there and secure that road. Rest of you guys get these supplies put away. - Major, just exactly who are we supposed to be protecting ourselves from? - Anybody on the outside! - Yeah Major, but hell, that could be 10 to 15 years from now. - Yeah, and it could be tomorrow. That's not the point here. When the shit hits the fan, every asshole out there is gonna be killing and eating each other in a week's time. There's gonna be no law. But we got the organization and the firepower to establish a new law in this area. Our law. - How much? - $400. - And what were the charges? - Drunk and disorderly. Girl decided to drop the charges, but I'll tell you this... - Ah, ah, think I can guarantee that it won't happen again. - This is a very small town. (dramatic music) (fun rock music) (laughing and partying) (dramatic music) - Pow, you're dead soldier boy. - Woo, ha ha. - What are you gonna do about those guys? - Shut up! (taunting) Shut up! - What we doing stopping here? - I want you to take a look around and see if we've been followed. - There ain't nobody around here. - Get out. Pretty desolate place out here, isn't it? - What are we doing out here? - What's this shit about you and a woman in town last night? - You should have seen that broad. She looked like she jumped out of Playboy. I just wanted... - Look it! I'm gonna tell you something! You gonna be a member of this organization you are going to do as I say and I'm telling you right now you will stay away from the women in that town. Is that clear? - Okay, okay, okay. - What is it with you? You got some kind of hormone problem or something? - You see this broad, you see hormones. I'm telling you, Major, she's into this fitness shit. I seen her running around up in the mountains like an Amazon. - [Major] Manny, hey! - She's got a body like... - Six years for sexual assault and you don't learn a goddamn thing. Now I want you to get up on top of the hill. - What for? - Because I told you to! - What for? - Get going, because I want you to take a look, now go! Come on, go! - There's nobody up here but a few of those biker punks. Bet they find a compound. (suspenseful music) Where are you going? Party time. Where'd they come from? - Lookee here, couple soldier boys. What do you got in the truck? - Camping gear. - Camping gear? We're looking for some stuff ourselves. Gets kinda worn out. You spend much time on this road? - First time. You know there's a place in Bishop where you can find just about anything you need. - Yeah? They won't take my check. - Yeah well banks are funny that way. - Maybe you wanna sell us some stuff? - Well, come to think of it, I got something that you might be interested in. - He's got something we might like. What the hell is that for? - Killing, mostly. - Killing what? - I'm not that particular. - Kill him, kill him! Come on Major, kill him! Kill him, Major! (engines starting) - Seeing you soon, Ace. Really looking forward to it. - Come on, come on! Why didn't you waste those punks? (laughs) - Manny, get in the truck. (dramatic music) Get the weapons. - [Voiceover] How'd it go in town, Major? - [Major] Ah, ran into some bikers with some kind of fancy T-shirts. - And the T-shirts said "Thrill Killers"? - Yeah. - Sounds like Sawbuck's gang. You were lucky you had a weapon handy. - What kind of name is Sawbuck? - Well I understand he got it once 'cause he offered to waste a guy for 10 bucks. - [Major] He do it? - So I hear. Some kind of drug deal. - Those assholes would be into drugs. Their headquarters around here? - Well, they been in town a week, 10 days, just screwing around. - [Voiceover] What about Jake and that new guy? - I'd leave early, Pierre get 'em. - What do you say we go get them soldier boys and have some fun, huh? (cheering) (engines revving) (chuckling) - Well you know gentlemen we may just if we lucky at all just have ourselves a little live exercise. (suspenseful music) Have we got everybody in position? - [Voiceover] Roger. - 'Bout how far away are they? - [Voiceover] About 500 yards. - Well you just wait until you can get 'em into a tight crossfire. I'm on my way, out. - [Voiceover] Roger. (grenade launchers exploding) (guns firing) (screaming) (gunfire) (screaming) (groaning) (punching smacks) - [Voiceover] All tied up down there, huh? - Yeah. (laughing) Hey baby. (screaming) Come on mama, come on. You liked that bike gang, didn't you, huh? Wait 'til you do some real hanging out now baby. Hey, smile for me, smile for me. (crying) You wanna do a little hanging out with us? Come on. - Blow your brains out. - Hey, settle down there mama, I got something for you. Hey baby, you wanna do a little hanging out, you wanna do a little hanging out with us? Come on, come on, hang out with daddy now. Hey settle down there mama, I got something for you. (screaming) (whip cracks) - Hey! What the hell you doing? This your idea, Jake? - Just having a little fun, Major. - We don't do this shit around here. Cut her down. Put her on the line. (choking) (screaming and crying) - Major! Look at what I found! Can I kill him? Ooh, what a scurvy looking broad. Let me kill him, hmm? Major, please, please. - Is anybody with you? (spits) Ron, was anybody else with 'em? - [Ron] Not a soul. - Now, one more time. - Up yours, asshole. (gun firing) (screaming and crying) - Shut up. Is anybody else with you? - [Woman] No. - You sure? - I swear it! No! Please! (gun firing) - Jesus, Major! - You think she was telling the truth? (screaming) - Ron. Take those bodies and throw them down the mine shaft with the others. Manny, look a little green around the gills. Tell you what I'm gonna do for you. You can have her. - Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up! Now the fun really can begin. Get in there, I'm not through with you yet. - Please don't kill me. - [Manny] I haven't decided what I'm gonna do with you yet. - Please, please. - [Manny] I haven't decided what I'm gonna do to you yet. - Please don't hurt me no more, please. (crying) - Shut up or I'll hurt you right now. Tell me you want me. Tell me you want me. Say please, Manny, I want you. - I want you, I want you, please, I want you, I want you. - Think about the snake pit. Think about the snake pit. - Ron. - Yeah. - Want you to send Manny and Pierre into town, get some quicklime, those bodies in the mine shaft are gonna smell like hell. (thunder rumbling) - [Manny] Well well, what do we have here? - Now remember what the Major said. Come on, let's go get those supplies. - To hell with the supplies. (chuckling) Hey baby, you want a ride? Come on, baby, don't be shy. You want a ride? You can sit right here. What's the matter, your tongue all worn out? Get in the truck. - Hey. - Get in there, get in! Get in there! Get outta here, get outta here! - You know I'm sick of this damn city life. - Yeah, Zack. - Let's get to the mountains, get us some nice, clean country air. - Let's go for it! - Kill ourselves some rabbits! (howling) (ominous music) - [Voiceover] So what are the snowmobiles for, Major? - I'll show you. Another month, this road's gonna be closed for the winter. Right about there. The only way in and out, snowmobiles. Ron, how you set for supplies? - Pierre and I have enough supplies to last us until spring. - Good. Rest of us will come up the third week of every month as usual and we can hide the snowmobiles right here at the turnout. - Why in the winter? There'll be 10 feet of snow up here by then. - Because we need the training. - We've been training all summer. - But not here. Ron and Pierre did a good job of finding this place. It's a classic defensive position, as those bikers found out. But we've gotta know every inch of the territory around here summer and winter. We don't know if war is gonna break out in the summer, Craig. The only thing that is certain is that it is gonna happen, some day, some time. And it might be months, maybe years before society gets reorganized out there. We're gonna be part of that reorganization. Meanwhile we're gonna have to survive, and that means we train. - Well I hope when the shit hits the fan there's some women up here 'cause I get awfully lonely at night. - Nobody but nobody brings a woman up here. When it breaks it's gonna be anarchy out there. There's gonna be disease, starvation, people fighting for a place to stay. You bring people up here, we don't have food, we don't survive! And I'm gonna survive, is that understood? - This is the one I've been telling you about, Major. This is my baby here. - Pierre. - He made me do it. - Take her. - Come on, Major. Major. - Get off! - Major, come on! - You stupid shit. (whip cracking) - Major! - What the hell are you doing bringing people down here? - Major, please! - [Major] Why'd you do it? - Major, please, Major. - [Major] I don't want anybody up here, Manny. - Major, it won't happen again Major! - Get up Laconi, come on, get up. Why'd you do it? - I'm sorry Major, won't happen again. - Laconi, the world's full of women. You wanna be a man, Laconi? You got to learn sacrifice. This is not wine, women, and song up here, this is no goddamn picnic! We're talking survival! - [Manny] I'm sorry. - If you wanna survive the night you gotta start listening to me! You got it? - What have you bastards done with this girl? - Forget her, you better start thinking about yourself. - She needs medical attention, now. - I said forget it. - Hey, come back here! Come back here! What have they done to you? - He killed them, he killed them all, and now he's gonna kill us. - Killed? Who killed who, what are you talking about? - The Major, he killed my friends, and now he's gonna kill us. - Who's this Major? - I don't know his name, they just call him the Major. He shot my friends. - How long have you been here? - I don't know, two days maybe. - You need a doctor, we've got to get you out of here. - It's no use, just do what he says. - The Major? - No, Manny, just do what Manny says. - What's your name? - Linda. - Listen, Linda, we've got to get you out of here. Hey! Hey somebody! Hey! - What's all the yelling about? - I wanna see the Major. - Maybe the Major doesn't want to see you. - Hey look buster, I wanna see the Major and I wanna see him now! - The Major will see you when he's ready. - Hey, this girl needs medical attention now! (ominous music) (classical music) - Pierre, I'm sick of this fag music. - I like it. - Get out. (ominous music) (classical music) (ominous music) - Didn't have to be this way, Tina. Could have been real nice. I didn't want those other pigs to have you, Tina. I wanted you for myself. But you got caught, Tina. You're gonna pay for it now, Tina. You hurt me, Tina. She was fine. - Can't keep her, Manny. - Why not? - Because we can't afford to feed the extra mouths. - You're not gonna let her go, are you? - No, I'm not gonna let her go. - What are you gonna do? - Hey Beau. I think she's gonna have the babies anytime, Beau. - Yeah, I know May. Well put her in the cage, we got a lot of work to do. (creepy music) - Yo, pops. We need a little gas, you got any gas around here? - Yeah, we got a little. - Hey Zack, take a look at this lady over here. - Hey. - Is everything alright, Beau? - May, you get in the house and fix that chicken. Where you going? - I just thought the lady might need a little help. - [Beau] Yeah well she don't need your help. - In fact, well we think she does. - Come back here! (intense music) (crying out) (screaming) (gun firing) - Let's get the hell outta here. Got no mama, got no papa. (gun firing) - Okay, the Major will see you now. - What about her? - I'll take care of her. Right Linda, right? - Yes Manny, you always take care of me. - Listen Manny, leave her alone. She's badly injured. - Come on, the Major doesn't like to be kept waiting. - Listen Manny, leave her alone! - Maybe she doesn't want me to leave her alone. You want me to leave you alone? - No, Manny. - Come on, she's hurt. - Let's go, the Major's waiting. - What did you tell that bitch? - Nothing Manny, honest. (bottle smashing) - You're gonna get it, bitch. You shouldn't have done that. (ominous music) - You got 60 seconds. - You know it takes a real tough guy to shoot a woman like this. - 48. - You're a slug, Hargrove. The worst of the lot. - 37. - I know now why you didn't take me last night. That gun is the only prick you've got. Without it, without this you've got nothing. - What the hell do you want? You haven't got much time left. - I want a chance. Give me one chance, you bastard. - 14 seconds. - Come on. Let me go and you and your men hunt me. Think you're tough? Hunt a woman, an unarmed woman. (creepy music) - I think we could use the exercise. What do you guys think? Want to have a little fun? You wanna hunt a lady? - You assholes! - You got two hours. This is a box canyon, I'd advise not going out in the desert 'cause you're not gonna find any cover there. You'd better take off up into the mountains. And I'm sending my animals after you in intervals. Ron? You set down at the end of this canyon and make damn sure she doesn't get out in the desert. Cut her loose. (ominous music) - Hand me the launcher. - I hope you gentlemen are gonna be safe out there. After all, she is an unarmed woman. Now look it. We've got Ron down here at the bottom of the canyon here so the only way she can go up is through Boulder Valley here to make it into the mountains, that's the only place she's gonna have cover once she gets past the rocks. - We're not gonna wait, are we? - Hell no, let's kill her. - She's got an hour and a half, Manny. You guys might as well take a seat. Okay, it's time. Jake's going first. (intense music) - Come on Major, let's go. - Go ahead, take off. Your turn, Pierre. (explosion) (whistles) - Nice car. - Why don't you guys just take a hike? - Hey, me and my old partner here we just worked ourselves up a little thirst, that's all. - Why don't you guys just leave us alone? - Here, take the beer, just take all you need. - That's right friendly of you, son. Brings us to another little problem. I don't suppose you got a few dollars you can loan me? - Here, I don't want any trouble. - Trouble? I don't want any trouble. You want any trouble? I don't want any trouble, Jamie. That your name, Jamie? - Oh shit, Jamie? - Yes, says so right here on the driver's license. Say Jamie, my partner and I here, we was watching you for a while and kinda wondering when the hell you gonna get around to poking the pretty young thing? - Why don't you assholes just get the hell outta here? - Why don't you just suck on this? (gun firing) (screaming) - Oh, come on baby, come on, come on baby, come on. Beg, bitch! (gun firing) Baby. (ominous music) (wind howling) (scary music) (crossbow firing) (intense music) (heavy breathing) (crying) - No, no, no please, please, please. Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me, please don't kill me. (shouts) (screams) - What the hell was that? - I don't know, but it sure didn't sound like the broad. - Let's take a look. (intense music) - Craig. Was that you fooling around out there? - No, I thought it was you guys. - Ah shit, where's Jake? - Pierre. - Hey! I found Jake. - Where? - Dead, she killed him! - What? - She can't get down past the compound, we'll just keep our usual watch, come back tomorrow. Let's go. - Major, what if she's following us? - Well, then why don't you and Pierre give her a little surprise? Find yourself a spot up on the hill. - Okay. Come on, Pierre. - Going back after looking for her all day. - Yeah well forget about that damn broad, she won't get past us. - Yeah but look what she did to Jake, she pulled that on him. - Jake screwed up! - Well hey, I think you're chickenshit for leaving him up there then. - Well I think you're an asshole! If you wanna go chase some broad that's got half of our arsenal and it's getting dark! - I was just... - Ah, you're just shooting your goddamn mouth off. I give an order buddy, you follow it. - Ah! - You killed Jake! You killed Jake! You killed Jake! - No, no. (crying out) (groaning) (explosion) - He got her! - Don't count on it. (tense music) (screams) - Hargrove, Hargrove! She killed Pierre with a hand grenade and all that was left was his leg hanging down. - Okay, I'm getting out of here. - No, no, no. All we gotta do is get our asses back to camp. Tomorrow we form a patrol and we come back after the broad. - Hey, she already killed two of our guys. - Yeah, she's picking us off like flies. - That's because they split up! She can't take us on in a group! - Okay, it's over. - Taconi, it is not over until we catch the broad, you got that? She gets back to the authorities and they find out about our little war and you spend the rest of your life in jail. - [Manny] Yeah, well jail sounds pretty good to me. - Yeah, well it doesn't to me. Besides you got a goddamn machine gun. - Yeah, and so did those guys. (crossbow twanging) (cries out) - You ready to quit? - We can't quit until we get the broad. - And then? - And then we dump her and the biker chick down the mine shafts and we go home. - What about the other guys? - The other guys are dead, Manny. They're bear food. You can forget about the Jeep, Manny. I pulled the distributor cap. - Linda, let's get out of here. Come on, let's go! (scary music) Manny, that son of a bitch! ♪ How many roads must a man walk down ♪ ♪ Before they call him a man ♪ (scary music) - [Ron] Hey kid. - Yeah? - Wanna show you something I learned 'Nam. And don't forget it. (exciting music) (explosions) (guns firing) - I've been waiting for you, mister. Move it, move it over there. Come on, move it. Keep moving. - Where? - You trained your men well, Hargrove, but like you they were too overconfident. Now move it over there! Move it! Keep going. Now jump. - Bullshit. - I said jump. (rattlesnakes hissing and rattling) You mean Manny didn't tell you about his little pets? Hargrove, you gave me a chance, now I'm gonna give you one. One shot, snake against snake. - Well now.
