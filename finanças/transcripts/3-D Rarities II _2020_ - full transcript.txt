(whimsical orchestral music) (bright orchestral music) - [Narrator] Ladies and gentlemen, this picture must be viewed through the colored spectacles that were presented to you when you entered the theater. Be sure the red lens is over the right eye. This might be called looking at the world through rose-colored glasses. (whimsical orchestral music) What a vacation spot. Peace, fresh air, and quiet. And at a reasonable rate, too. Wanna bet? Anyhow, here's ma and the two kids fresh off of the train, and I do mean fresh. That's the hired man in the front seat. What is he so happy about? Too much peace and quiet. Smell that fresh air. (coughing) Pardon me, little too much fresh air. Well, vacation time, and soon the cries of happy children sound over the peaceful countryside. And here we are at the Chateau le de France. No wonder they said reasonable rates. Come shall we, the luggage. Oh boy, you'll never play for Brooklyn. Hey, take it easy. Ouch, my corn. Gee, I guess I shouldn't mention corn around here. Early to bed, early to rise, that's silly. I wonder if they have modern plumbing in this joint. (bright orchestral music) Come on in Butch, get a load of this. Whoops, I bet you thought that was an accident. A smith, a mighty man is he, but just between us folks, he's muscle-bound above the ears. Oh that's hot! Ah take off that beard, we know ya. What a character, horseshoes he gives 'em. Nah, that's for sissies. Yeah but wait a minute, they got an idea. What a build up. Imagine what they can do with a pool cue. (bright orchestral music) William Tell had nothing on him. You just know what's gonna happen. Ooh, I can't look! (horseshoes clanging) Now all he needs is a horse's tail. Ah, here they are, the Katzenjammer Kids. Just out for an innocent walk in the country. (birds chirping) (bright orchestral music) Say, I might learn to like this country life. Ah come on now girls, that tickles, now stop. Another one, all right, all right, so you got six more veils. Come on, we're running out of film. (whimsical orchestral music) Come on kids, get out of here now. Now stop that, give the girls a chance. We want the girls. (imitates gorilla screaming) Come on in, the water is fine. Hey, I just remembered I can't swim. (whimsical orchestral music) (chickens clucking) What is this, magic at a time like this? The guys will never learn. Exactly. Look, made a funny, made a funny. This is known as seeing eye to eye. I'll bet he doesn't eat scrambled eggs for a long time. What's so rare as a day in June? Blue skies, trees, apples. Inspiration, and what a panorama. That reminds me, what happened to those dancing girls? Ah, the Rover Boys. Inspiration moves them, maestro. Hey, look out with that brush! (bright orchestral music) Just a few more deft strokes of the brush and another masterpiece will be ready for the ash can. (apples thudding) Eh, never touched me. A little clean fun and a quick getaway. They can't do that to you, Rembrandt. Honest, mama, we were just walking along and minding our own business when this fink runs up behind us with a big brush. They're here again. (bright orchestral music) That's right honey, keep kissable. (cows mooing) Ah, confidentially, do you use that green stuff? Everything is all set here and they go right into the arms of pickle puss. Get away from us, you pest! Ah, you missed me. You've been waiting for this. That was the farmer's daughter. Ah, they're gonna make dairy, huh? Well folks, this is gonna be a tight squeeze. It's efficiency, that's what it is. Direct from the manufacturers to you. (bottles thudding) Ladies and gentlemen, the motorcar of the future. Think it'll work? Hey, come back here! (engine revving) All we need in this picture is a hitchhiker. Some fun. Wow, watch that pickup. (horn blaring) That was a beaut. (playful orchestral music) And it's Seabiscuit by a nose. One side, her leg off, look out! (horn honking) Come on, grab the wheel. Head's up, watch it! (horn blaring) (cars thudding) Ow, that hurt. Ah, shut up. Hey, mom! This picture is coming to no good end. (tender orchestral music) - [Prince] Benno. Benno. Benno. Benno. - [Narrator] How changed it is. This was not always the home of owls and bats. Here, Prince Siegfried came to meet his betrothed, Odette. Here, Siegfried my friend, was snared by Rothbart the Enchanter, who changed his own daughter into Odette's lovely form. There Odile, the enchantress, danced with Siegfried, luring him on. Whilst in vain at the window the real Odette besot him to remember her. The sorcerer's art banished Odette, and blinded by his ecstasy, Siegfried promised to marry Odile. Then he saw Odette, too late. The enchanters Roth destroyed them in a mighty storm.

Welcome to our little jaunt through time and space to a lesser known facet of golden age of 3-D. One that seemed to leap off movie screens and into the hands of many photo enthusiasts. It started with the introduction of the Stereo Realist camera in 1947. Actually preceding 3-D movies by five years. And unlike its bulky predecessors used miniature 35 millimeter film, allowing the same portability as any snapshot camera. The film of choice for the Realist was the legendary Kodachrome. Its bright palette perfectly capturing the optimistic post-war era. In 3-D it provides us with the most vivid and immediate portrait of mid-century American life, which with the passage of time often seems as exotic now as the fantastic 3-D spectacles offered audiences back then. So let us begin our journey. As mother looks on, this boomer baby reaches out from across the decades to bring us into their knotty pine world. Let us take his hand and visit the sunny 16 side of their lives. On the slide mount is written "All the kids at Christmas, 1948." And it's wonderful to see examples from the early adopters still figuring out composition and depth. I like that the tree was too tall for the room, so the top is laying on the mantle. And as is often the case, I wonder if any of the children are still alive. This one was entitled "On route, 1951." America on the go, taking us into the nifty '50s. Today we'd hardly think to take a photo of a gas stop, but we can be glad these folks did. It is a great example of something seemingly routine becoming special with the passage of time. This cleverly composed slide emphasizes the hazards of construction work in more ways than one. Shot in Los Angeles, that is the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance building in the background. And that big clock makes me think of silent movie comedian Harold Lloyd in "Safety Last." A title which probably would not be endorsed by Pacific Mutual. By this time, however, Lloyd was himself enthusiastically shooting stereo slides by the many thousands. Construction came in all scales. In this case as a pastime in this very professional-looking slide, featuring a father and son forming a bond over the building of a model airplane. A bond nearly as strong as one can achieve from that tube of tester's glue right there. It should come as no surprise 3-D was a pastime unto itself, with many dimensions. Movies, photography, and 3-D comics, which enjoyed its own popularity. Here, combining two of those, we get to look at this woman looking at 3-D in 3-D. Okay, maybe not everyone was enthralled with 3-D. While Junior appears to be taking a break from binge watching View-Master reels, he gives the stereo camera an adorable smile. However, grandma looks forlorn, as if she'd rather be anywhere else. Perhaps grandma would like to trade places with this tanned woman at a roadside stop in Florida standing among low-priced shells, corals, various alligator goods, and a flock of decorative lawn ornament flamingos. Or if one prefers live birds to the ornamental variety, she could stop at Parrot Jungle. This slide is imaginatively entitled "Five Parrots on May" and must have been the required pose of every tourist visiting Florida who wanted to get the most color out of their Kodachrome. Speaking of color, here we see the huge, first generation RCA color television camera aimed at the parade queen's float during the New Year 1954 Tournament of Roses parade. A suitably chromatic subject for the first coast-to-coast color cast. From big time broadcasting to the quaint charm of early local TV, as regional hillbilly band The Blue Ridge Boys performs for the black and white cameras in a cramped studio for a short-lived Pennsylvania station. More spectacle could be found at General Motors' traveling auto show called Motorama, featuring fanciful concept cars. Finding ourselves at the 1956 extravaganza, we see the futuristic Pontiac Club de Mer in the spotlight. Thanks to professional photographer Jack Laxer, who also took the previous slide, we get a privileged, unobstructed view of this sporty Club de Mer, along with the great mid-century style display framing it and other dream machines. Ford had its own concept cars, and here is the most famous, the Lincoln Futura. It would later gain greater fame after being transformed into the 1960s television Batmobile. But only those who see this slide today can get a sense of what it was like to stand in front of it during its debut at the 1955 Chicago Autoshow. Best known for their popular movies, the comedy team of Abbott and Costello had their own TV show from 1952 to 1954, around the time this slide was taken. In a publicity shot, possibly promoting Wisconsin cheese with some unidentified pageant winner, Bud Abbott hams it up while Lou Costello looks like he just woke up. Halloween fun in 1959 with big brother dressed as a spaceman, giving his little sister Cinderella a peak into the jack o'lantern in an adorable pose. Elevating it further is how wonderfully the costume colors harmonize with those of the kitchen. Late in 1955 Kodak introduced its own stereo camera with features and price aimed at greater mass sales than the Realist. This ad enticed potential customers to visit Kodak dealers with the lure of seeing how much more impact the featured photo will look in three dimensions. And the difference is profound. If you notice other more subtle differences within the image that is because each dealer's stereo slide was an original to provide best quality. It also means those models were posing for a long, long time. Of course, once the customer was on the line, a few more slides to reel them in. Thanks to Kodak, Christmas 1955 was recorded in Kodachrome stereo by many more enthusiasts. And we have many more stereo slides to enjoy today. If, in 1953, you took Groucho Marx's advice and visited the De Soto Plymouth dealership during Christmastime, this is what you'd see, showroom showmanship. The latest models vie with the decorations for the most sparkle and shine in an evocative nighttime holiday stereo. Here, stereo enhances Suzy's excitement on Christmas day in 1950. Sitting on her new tricycle in probably a new dress, Suzy is cute enough to be mistaken for a doll. There is plenty of lead tinsel to fill in the tree's rather spindly branches. The boys had to get dressed up for their Christmas pictures, too. This young man's excitement is equally evident, and no wonder. Among the shiny new trucks he got his own Mr. Machine, which would likely date this slide to the early to mid-1960s. Kids may anticipate Christmas, but the Bobby Darren-esque Joe here was looking forward to New Year 1961, where on the stroke of midnight he proposed to Dot, his very own Sandra Dee. Cake already on hand, so the answer was a done deal. Good thing she didn't say no, that would have been awkward. When it's time for the wedding the seasoned pros would take a large format black and white album photos and get first dibs on the best angles, while the stereo cameras were given to the new guys, who often had to become equally creative to get their shots in any way they could. This great slide shows both, along with the pro's shiny pants. Delightfully illustrating what many might imagine the wedding couple to be thinking about their first night together, the groom looking up from the sex manual offers a sly wink, while the bride's faux shock contains a hint of anticipatory grin. Remember, it's the '50s. She cannot seem too eager. After the wedding, in a pose and composition worthy of Norman Rockwell, this bride shows off her ring to her party, all taking a smoke break. The junior bridesmaid in pale yellow is too young, so must enjoy her smoke secondhand. Embarking on their journey as a married couple, bride and groom are showered with well wishes and confetti. A wonderful fleeting moment frozen in time and space, though it's an odd feeling when viewing such slides, realizing their future is now in the past. Remember May, she of the five parrots? That's her in the front, sitting with some newlyweds on honeymoon at the Castaways Wreck Bar in Miami, Florida. With decor to suggest a sunken ship, patrons are encouraged to drink like fish. In that spirit, hubby holds his drink aloft for the camera while wifey is already giggling. May's husband was also motivated to record the unattended Castaways' back bar for posterity. Through the cigarette smoke we see all kinds of details, including an emaciated merperson and hotel swimmers through bubble-like windows. Hey, we really are under water. Now here's a back bar that looks like it was populated by central casting. The woman preparing the drinks appears ready to crack wise, while the bartender is glaring as if he's ready to bounce us for having one too many. Hey buddy, we only see double when we take off our 3-D glasses. And for a panoramic swimming view of a more organized fashion, nothing beats the mermaid show at Weeki Wachee Springs, a favorite Florida attraction since 1947. This slide shows how sublime an already great view can become when photographed in stereo. Of course the traditional honeymoon spot is Niagara Falls, and here we find ourselves taking the Cave of the Winds tour on the American side in 1956. Even the narrow format of the Realist slide can offer an epic view given the right location and angle. High above the water in the Disneyland sky ride we look down and see the Chicken of the Sea pirate ship restaurant as it appeared in 1961. Both attractions are gone, making this view impossible, but for this slide. While the Disneyland sky ride kept riders safe within its buckets, in Banff, Alberta, Canada, the only safety measure for this ski lift rider seems to be a tight grip. Fortunately the deceptive angle only makes it appear he might fall into the vastness of the Canadian Rockies. Elsewhere in the Rockies, Charles takes a creative self portrait in the reflecting ball at the Chateau Lake Louis Hotel, also seen in the reflection. In 1952, everyone gets dressed up to take pictures by the lake. A much larger orb, the Unisphere, here brand new as the centerpiece of the 1964 New York World's Fair. Standing on the base used for the Perishphere from the 1939 fair, we really get a sense of the scale of the giant globe thanks to stereo and the boys in the foreground. A place has been prepared for us at Bob's birthday party. Quite the formal affair for children of the era, let's just pull out the chair and have a seat. The good china wisely remains in the cupboard in favor of more appropriate dinnerware. Bob will have to blow out the candles before anyone is allowed to reach for their cupcake. This youngster is taking to the suburban sidewalk in the ever popular pedal firetruck, while the man in the background may be guarding his '53 Dodge from the riding toy, which looks like it has seen its share of collisions. It's probably a hand me down from the boy standing behind, who is now too big for it. Now here's a familiar Big Boy outside one of his coffee shops in a superb nighttime stereo by professional photographer Jack Laxer, who used the medium to show off his architect client's work to best advantage. Another Laxer stereo of Bob's Big Boy Coffeehouse. This view, also taken from outside, shows us the texture of the environmental-style exterior, as well as the mid-century modern interior. Mr. Laxer was a master of getting the most out of his stereo camera with almost tangible results. On to Fremont Street in Las Vegas. A city with visual appeal best appreciated at night. Posing in 1958 by a cool Olds convertible, this man is showing us he hasn't lost his shirt yet. Now he's ready for some hot action at the slots. Vegas by day at the Thunderbird Hotel in 1955. All kinds of vintage goodness here, and good 3-D by bringing the misses closer to the camera. I wonder if it was a coincidence the colors of her outfit match the hotel perfectly. A few years before hitting Vegas himself, a young Jerry Lewis spends some quiet time opening his mail and enjoying a beer. Taken in the early 1950s, this is a study in contrasting patterns, making excellent use of the Kodachrome film. An avid photographer, it comes as no surprise Mr. Lewis would be featured in stereo. But for a real break from modern life there is nothing like nature. Taken in the Finger Lakes region in New York state in the fall of 1959, one can almost smell the crisp fall air as we get the photographer in this scene, which he himself is photographing as well. We end on a slide with a serenity of its own. Entitled "Sis", taken Christmas week 1956. On furniture protected by a plastic slip cover, Sis, in polka dots and Mary Janes, watches what I imagine to be a local broadcast of school children singing Christmas carols. A tricky existing light shot perfectly distilling that which inspires nostalgia for the era. Thank you for joining me in this unique photographic journey. I hope you found the vivid imagery as transporting as I do, and share my appreciation for those who left behind this rich visual record of the mid-century. Farewell.

(whimsical music) - [Narrator] Gaze through the magic glasses, if you dare. You are now entering the world of new wide-screen motion picture third dimension. Where beings who only lived before in man's imagination now come to realistic, full-dimensional life. You are about to see the most amazing assortment of monsters and fantastic creatures that the 3-D screen has yet presented. And they will come right over to you, emerging from the screen into the audience as they claim their latest victims. Are you ready to face them? The strange story which is about to unfold concerns creatures not of flesh and blood, but of darkness, evil, and horror. Those tormented souls, branded with the mysterious plague of the Castle of Frankenstein. They who have lived mortal lives before, but now bear the curse of the undead. The mark of the werewolf. The Frankenstein family castle is cold. Its lifeless stone walls carry their secret well. It is of the full moon, the bite of the wolf, and the name Wolfstein, which marks the forbidden castle as the tomb of the hideous beast who once walked as a man. But years have passed, and many people have forgotten about the castle and the creature buried in its crypt. Maybe it was all a legend. Maybe there never was a Frankenstein Castle. Maybe the curse of Wolfstein isn't real. Maybe a living wolf monster doesn't exist. Or maybe he lives now and wants your blood.
