[dramatic music] [suspenseful music] It is important to get this guy on tape. Be extremely careful. Ganzo. Ganzo. Ganzo! I should have a gun! No. You're not a cop. Zuchi, give me a gun. How about I give you a bullet. Button your shirt. Your guest is arriving. Shit. You owe me for this. Don't screw up. - [bell rings] - [door opens] Tenzin! My friend. Please join me. Are you ready for some tasty dishes? [Russian music playing on radio] Sorry. Where is Serik? He has been sent to America. On a little errand. Why? Is my company not good enough for you? Ah, come on! I'm happy to do business with you. It's good to see you moving up in the ranks. Sir, can you please turn down the radio? No! I like this song. I've fed you. What did you bring me? Whoa, look at this! [cackling] Let's drink! [interference on the radio] Give me that. To your health. To your health. Now, what else can I do to keep your miners going? They get lonely down in their holes. Sure thing. Let's see. I may have a few young, pretty... Mongolian girls. You like that? I was exactly looking for... a couple of young... pretty Mongolian girls. Maybe you can introduce them to me? [suspenseful music] Hey! What's this? Tenzin, it's not what it looks like! My friend, please! Freeze! Freeze! Don't move! - We will shoot! - Drop your weapon! Fuck you! I'll kill her! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Gentlemen, be calm, be calm! Okay, gentlemen. Okay. Everything is okay. We're leaving. We're leaving. Die, bitch! [woman screams] [car approaches] Nice car, lieutenant Starsky. Starsky drove a Torino. You've got to keep it together here, man. - This is an important one. - They're all important ones. [Troy] How long have you been under? Long enough. Wade. - 23 days. - [Troy] And Hannah? [Wade] Hannah is always on shore and I'm always out at sea. Alright. Let's get this thing done. Yeah, push the button on the side. Now, anyone checking that, they're going to think you forgot to charge. But it's always on. It's always recording. Look, we need you to get this guy, Jin, on tape talking about trafficking. Talking about intent to traffic again. When you say the safe word, we're going to rain down on that place with every kind of hell we have. Yeah, that's your contact. That's Jin. And look, this guy, he can seem like your best friend. But man, he can change on a dime. So just watch him. Got it. [Troy] Yeah, those are trafficked girls. Jin and his gang, they lie to them. Promise them jobs, free tuition to Western universities. Then they take their passports, and boom, they're stuck. Some of them never go home. And who is the spook? [Troy] We don't know yet. Kind of showed up recently. We think he's senior management. Maybe he's here to reign in Jin. It seems them two have some kind of beef. - So maybe you can use that, or something. - Great. And how are the local authorities are out here? Are they... they're cool? Eh... they can be a little overzealous. Shit. Yeah. So, are we arresting you tonight? Yeah, stick with the plan. I've got too much invested in this Preston character to burn him out. [Troy] Shit. We're close. [knocking on the door] [bead curtain rattles] [Asian hip hop] I'm supposed to meet Jin. Is he here? Jin sends his apologies. He cannot meet today. Well... [chuckles] you look like a man who wants to talk business. I'm here, so... let's talk business. What I offer is access. Safe access to the rich businessmen that stay at my casino. Think of me as a concierge for the shit that you really want. The shit that you can't ask a real concierge for. You mind if I smoke? He says he has rich customers for you at his casino. That's the beauty of this arrangement. My clients are willing to pay for the discretion that I offer. What I can do for you is walk your product from the loading dock, into the service elevator, directly in to my clients' room. I take a fee and it's not cheap. But I spread it around a bit. And the cops get a cut. The important thing is you get your share, without the overhead and risk. He can get girls into the casino secretly, through the back doors. And he bribes the cops. He wants a cut. But he'll carry the risk. Once this asshole shuts up. Pack your things quickly. We have to go. [glass shatters] [hissing sound] Get over there. [suspenseful music] [explosion] Get down! Down! [man] Down! Get down! Get your hands where I can fucking see them! Get Your hands where I can fucking see them! - Put your hands up! - He doesn't speak... Shut up. Get your hands where I can fucking see them. Into the wall. Turn around! Turn around! Turn around now, motherfucker. Turn around! He doesn't speak English! Can you fucking quit... I told you to shut the fuck up! [dramatic music] [woman screams] [whimpering] No! [panting] [siren wailing] You screwed me, man! What the fuck was that, Troy? Why did SWAT breach? I didn't have anything! Calm down! I can explain. That's why. That's our friend Jin. Where is the rest of him? Shit. Let's go. [police siren] [telephone ringing] [printer wiring] [telephone ringing] What's this? Uh, that is a boarding pass? Economy plus. - Pretty good. - Don't say I never did anything for you. Cool. Why is my name on it? You are the lead on this task force. You made the collar. So you will be accompanying Mr. Serik Ibriajev to Mongolia. Mongolia? Uh, that collar was made here in Texas, where I watched him carve through an entire SWAT team. Whether it was dumb luck or divine fiat, you made one hell of an arrest last night, Wade. This Serik guy... he is an operative for an international crime syndicate out of Mongolia. These guys are into illegal gold mines, drugs, protection rackets. And most recently, human sex trafficking. The Mongolians think that they can get our friend Serik to turn state's evidence. So get a Marshall to do it, that's what they're there for. I mean, sending me to Mongolia, that's.. that's bullshit. - Troy, would you close the door please. - Sure. With you on the other side of it. [door closes] - Okay. - [drawer opens] Let's talk about bullshit. You left these at the scene. They must have fallen out of your pimp costume. Now I have to explain to IA how your fucking drugs ended up in chain of custody. Why don't you explain them that I was a little preoccupied with the whole violent, bloody mayhem thing. These are pain killers. Your injury was 9 months ago. Look, you had a shitty year, Wade, I get it. - Yeah. - But you are too young to be washed up. You made a good pull last night. Now go get your head together. - What about the girl? - She goes too. The other girls are going to ICE. Oh, fuck those guys! What are you trying to accomplish here, Pierce? I'm picking my battles. You'd be wise to do the same. Why is she in handcuffs? Because she's a criminal, Wade. She is a victim. Do you know how many of these trafficked women become traffickers themselves? Anyway, you're taking her home. You'll be meeting a Detective Ganzorig for the hand off. [knocks on the door] Work. Right. Let's go. Tomorrow we will arrest Arslan at his casino. Per an agreement with his attorney, he is surrendering himself to our custody. This is not good news. Arslan will be laughing when we put the cuffs on him. He is making fools of us because of you. How has it come to this? Take some responsibility! You two made a great mistake yesterday. He is toying with us. Arslan knows you failed to arrest his enforcer. Without a witness, the case dies. However... there is one thing Arslan doesn't know. The American FBI and the Mongolian National Police have just arrested Arslan's other top enforcer. Serik Ibrayev. He is on a flight to UB as we speak. In the custody of an American special agent. Serik arrives at dawn. We have just 48 hours to secure a conviction. Deliver the witness to court. Or we will lose Arslan probably forever. You will be coordinating with Commander Khadaan. - You can go now. - Yes, sir. [dramatic music] Detective. Detective Ganzorig. Nice to meet you, Wade Dalton. Shit. Yeah, sorry. Do you want me to drive since I'm already... No? Okay. How was your trip? Quite good. Good. How many days did it take to produce that? About seven days. How many? About seven days? Thirteen days. How many? Why did it take so long? This is an old mine. It's getting harder to mine gold. There is a legal mine opening nearby, with higher pay. Rumor has it our employees want to go there. Well, it means there's something that our employees aren't happy with. How was your lunch meeting yesterday? Tell me. I want to know everything. That sob Erdene was working for the cops. He betrayed us. He was wearing a wire. This hole is dry! There's nothing here. Not even the smell of gold! The Russians already took all the gold that was here. We should dig somewhere else. The Russians left because their empire collapsed, not because Mongolia is out of gold. What do you know of Mongolia? You are a foreigner! My ancestors roamed these lands for 500 years. That is ancient history! Look around! This is not Mongolia. This is my land now. You are the foreigner here. Now, crawl back in your hole and dig. Dig! Let me go. Let me go! The old man says the hole is dry? Let's stop wasting our time and efforts. Fill it in. Now! Why are you standing still? - Quickly. - Quickly fill in the hole! Hurry up! [light tense music] Khulan! I'm sorry. I thought... Well, that woke me up. Probably shouldn't have snuck up on you, huh? No, just stay there. Are you okay? Could use a drink. Look, I can't sleep, it's like 10 a.m. in east Texas, so you'd be doing me a favor. I promise I won't interrogate you. [man singing in karaoke] This guy is really good, right? I think he's in the wrong key. Yes, I also think he's in the wrong key. I knew that. - Pour yourself one, please. Thank you. - Thank you. I used to want to do this. Sing badly? No. You wanted to be a singer? Actually I was, uh, when I was a little girl, that was my dream. That's how they tricked me. The traffickers. And they told me that... "Oh, you're going to perform for rich people at the hotels in Chicago and Las Vegas." And I believed them. I was so dumb. You're not dumb. Maybe I'm not. But they are smarter. What about Serik? Is that, is that what he does? You said you weren't going to. Right, sorry [chuckles]. Occupational habit. So do you, um... you have a place to stay tonight? My friend, she is in Korea with her boyfriend, so I can stay there until they return. And then? Home? My family knew a different person. I would rather they remember me the way I was. Without the shame. I think I can't go back home. Hey. I remember you. Your name is Jessica. Are you still doing the same thing? I have a room upstairs. What does he want? What is he saying? Sorry. Sorry. Sir, I think you've had enough. - Let me call you a taxi... - You, shut the fuck up. What are you doing with this foreigner? Come here, whore. Please stop this. My friend and I are talking. You think he's your friend? Silly bitch. What is he saying? He says you are not her friend. And... some other stuff too. I bet he did. She's a whore. Hey! Tell him, tell him for me, please. Come here! I want to buy you a drink. Come here. Tell him that, yeah. He wants to buy you a drink. Him? A beer is a beer! How many dollars does it take to make your thighs wet? Hmm? Hey. Drink is ready. [glass shattering] [suspenseful music] I want to make an official complaint! That blonde man tried to kill me! The problem is... Good evening. What happened here? You see, that man had too much to drink. I asked him to leave. He refused. What he said. You are making trouble. Well, to be fair, he started it. You are FBI agent. What are you doing with that hooker? Do you want to save all of them? You can go to Macau, there is more than 3,000. What's wrong with just saving one? That's my job. But you weren't doing it, I was. Have a good night. So... what do you think of these rookies? They look like children. I selected them personally. Eager, principled, the elite of their class. Most importantly, I know they're not corrupt. Because they've never seen the inside of this station. Any new leads on the mole? Be patient. The investigation is ongoing. As you know... these things take time. But do we have any? The courthouse... is three kilometers east of here. It will not be an easy trip. You better be prepared. I have a plan. [suspenseful music] Agent Wade, You are with me. I believe this is what you asked for. Yes, this will do. - Thank you. - Of course. You must always be alert. The most dangerous point is Jamiyangun street. We may run into strong resistance. But I'm confident you are all up to the task. Get him out. Out. I need a volunteer. Unmarried. No kids. Trained. - Height? - 180 centimenters tall. 180 centimenters tall. Sir, I volunteer. I am ready. I'm 178 centimeters. No. Look at your belly. He will be killed. These rookies are too young. You need a seasoned cop in that convoy. They won't know what to do if there's trouble. Stand down. [suspenseful music] Detective, your fat partner doesn't look anything like me. Yeah, well, no women were available. [laughs] I think I understood that. You're making a mistake. Your people will die. Leave that asshole here with those suckers. Send me out with one officer. When my people come... I'll keep him safe. You're a fucking criminal. You're telling me how to do my job? Go ahead. Everyone move out. Let's go! - Wade. - Yeah? You come with me. [suspenseful music] [horn honking] [police siren] [horns honking] - [gun firing] - [glass shattering] [distant shooting] Hey, Ganz, your decoy is working, let's stick to the plan and take this asshole to court. It makes no difference, Detective. I'll never testify. You should go save your friends. Wait for me. Don't go anywhere. [gunshots] Take the key. Take the key. Unlock that cuff. Unlock the cuff. Come on, come on. Now, I know you can't understand me, and I don't really care, but if you step one foot out of this taxi, I'm going to shoot you in your pretty face. [suspenseful music] [gunshots] Hey! Comrads! Comrads! I'm over here! Serik! Serik! Go! Go! That's not him! - I don't know... - Where is Serik? You motherfucker! Hey! Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Did you see that bastard's face? He thought I was Serik. Yeah, you had everyone fooled. I was going to wear a vest. But it would have made me even fatter. Gonzo. I'm thirsty. Get water. [footsteps approaching] [cellphone buzzing] Don't go to the courthouse. Head to the safehouse and wait for my call. Detective... I warned you. [tires skidding] [suspenseful music] [Wade] Whoa, Ganz! Ganz! Whoa! Whoa, Whoa, woah! Ganz! Put the gun down, Ganz! Look at me. Put the gun down. You do not want to do this. - [Serik grunting] - Shut the fuck up. I don't want to shoot you, Ganz. - Put the gun down! - Get back in the fucking car! I saw what they did to Borgil. So did he, he knows he's alone. All he's got left is to testify. Go back to your America. Tell them we are all crazy here! This is not your battle. Okay, hey. I don't speak your language so I don't know how to talk you down. But if you do this, Ganz... then Borgil died for nothing. You can't come back from this. So let's take him to court, yeah? [yelling in Mongolian] Get in the fucking car. [light dramatic music] [cellphone buzzing] Okay. Leave them there and come see me on the hill. Understood? Yeah. On my way. Wade, you stay here. - Watch him. - Why? Are you going somewhere? [speaking in Mongolian] Ganz, I don't... [door closes] This is fucking insane. [men chattering in Mongolian] [ominous music] [men continue chattering] Arslan, it's time. They're here. Shall we continue this later? I'll be back. Bring more money next time. [suspenseful music] Keep calm! I don't want this. Let's go! Let's go! [cellphone buzzing] What is it, Wade? Shit, did I wake you? Yeah, you did. It's late, really late. - Sorry. This fucking time change, I thought you might... - What do you want? I just wanted to... check on the dog. Buddy's okay. He's chewing on himself again. Like bad. Wait, did you give me his meds? - No, I didn't. - Why? I have them, which reminds me... Why do you have the dog's pills? Because Buddy and I are on the same drug, for anxiety. I'll get straight, I just... I really miss you. Yeah? Is that the dog's psych drugs talking? No. Can I see you when I get back? - Just come back safe. - Yeah, okay, okay. I'll... Guess watching me is better than anything on Russian TV, right? I got to admit, it feels good unloading this all on a degenerate Russian pimp who buys and sells women like they're nothing. That reminds me, how much did you pay for that pretty translator of yours? [chuckles] Probably just won her in some back alley cock fight in Kiev. Kiev is in Ukraine. Did your idiotic American schools make you suck at geography? Or is that the drugs too? Fuck me. You speak fucking English? Yes, I speak fucking English. Maybe fucking better than you fucking do. And also I know French, Mongolian and German. I was raised by a history professor and have fondness for the French nouvelle vague. And also, I am not Russian. I am Kazakh. Do you know anything about anything? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. You're Serik, the renaissance pimp. [knocking on the door] That's a lot of blood. It's not mine. Here. Put on some clean clothes. A fat man makes an easy target. Even a blind man could hit Borghii. Sir, If you will arrange protection, I will get the Kazakh to court. There has been enough bloodshed today. [suspenseful music] Arslan's people did not come to rescue Serik. They came to kill him. You don't get it. You have awakened a sleeping lion... Commander, my job is not done yet- That's enough. Go to the hospital now. Borghii is waiting for you. Leave Serik and the American to me. Tell me. What will Borghii say when I see him? To be realistic. To let this one go. Your friend will tell you to listen to your superior. The friend who died in my hands? Yes. The friend you left bleeding in the street. Do you want to hear what I think he would say? Go ahead. Blow his brains out. Tear him apart, and feed him to the fucking dogs! Hello. We are here for the prisoner. We are here for prisoner. Who sent you? Detective Ganzorig. Ganz. Ganz? Ganz sent you guys? Alright, hold on. Alright, moment of truth. Your ride's here. Don't trust them. They are bullshit cops. Bullshit cops? Yeah, how would you know? Give me your wrist. U.B. cops don't knock. - [knocking on the door] - Okay! Give it a rest already! Hey! Detective said to wait here. He said, "Open the door to no one but me." Maybe that's what he said, but I don't speak Mongolian. Want me to take your word for it? - [knocking on the door] - Agent, undo the handcuffs right now. Eat a dick. Okay, we're going to wait for Ganz to get back. He's going to come back, we are going to wait for him. Understand? The American says you should go back and wait in your cute little Prius. Maybe you can pass the time by sucking each other's dicks. That wasn't helpful. It was just a suggestion. What did you say? Look out! [intense music] [blade unsheathes] [Wade yells] [Wade grunts] Check them for keys. Hey! What's happening? Answer me or we're coming in! Put the gun down. Put the gun down! More are coming. You need help. [rapid gun firing] [distant shooting] It's over. I'm going to see you buried, you corrupt motherfucker! Do you really believe this ends with me? You are all alone. It's over. Even if we don’t kill you, do you know who’s who? Now run along. Time to dig graves for those two bastards. [suspenseful music] Fuck! Fuck! Drive! Drive! Drive! [intense music] I can't reach it. [Serik] Pull the brake. Now! Come on, first gear. Third! Third! Look out! Go, go around him. Go around him. Fucking watch out for the truck. Where the fuck did you learn to drive? [Serik shouting in Russian] I don't fucking speak Russian! Pull the fucking e-brake! [engine dies] You let him drive? Yeah, but his handcuffs stayed on. Team effort. [gentle music] [engine dying] [Wade] So, what's the plan? [Ganzorig] I don't know. We can't stay in U.B. It's too dangerous. [Serik] I know a place we can go. [TV chattering in Mongolian] [door closes and locks] It's not that bad in here. Almost like house arrest. The police are struggling to address the recent surge in sex trafficking. Mongolia is a source country for traffickers. Young women are especially vulnerable to the lies and of the traffickers. This year more than one thousand women have gone missing from the city and numbers are rising. Women are warned against walking alone at night as violent abductions have been reported. [Serik] My friends here are from the underworld. They are not friends of Arslan. And they hate the Syndicate more than you do. You are Syndicate. Why would they trust you? Let's say I handle my business in a different way than Tenzin. Brother. Weren't allowed entering US, huh? Now US has come here and took me alone. CIA? FBI. Let's go over there. What happened? Look, I need to lay low for a while. Who are these guys? Don't worry. They're chasing something else. Hope you didn't bring the Syndicate here? I wouldn't ask you if I had someone alive. - [device beeps] - [door unlocks] [intense music] [grunts] Shh! Serik thinks he's the best in his business. But he forgot the main rule of the salesman. Never sample your product. You might get hooked. No. [yelling] [eerie music] [camera clicking] [somber music] [camera clicking] [light dramatic music] [cellphone ringing] [cellphone continues to ring] Khulan? [cellphone buzzes] [cellphone buzzes] [cellphone buzzes] [suspenseful music] I told you, if you ran I'd put a bullet in the back of your head. Are you running? Are you ready to testify now? Serik must appear in the court tomorrow, noon. If we are late one minute... the judge will declare it a mistrial. We are almost 30 kilometers away from the city center. Arslan's men will block the road. And they will stop every car until they find us. What about Khulan? You have no idea who you're dealing with. Serik is fucking smart... with skills you can't comprehend. Arslan doesn't choose his people at random. I am Serik's only equal. And if he decides to kill you... Or you... he will do it. Serik once ran in on some bastard... who was stealing our money. He whispered something in his ear... and that bastard cut his own throat. [cellphones buzzing] [knocking on the door] [clattering on the floor] [light suspenseful music] "SERIK'S NOT COMING THEY ARE GOING TO THE TRAIN STATION" He was just trying to warn us that Serik will not come. He doesn't need you. Neither does your child! Our clients like pregnant women. They will like you. You two, stay with her. Watch her. You're as stupid as she is. All the rest, follow me. I hope you were right about this. Yeah, I do too. [somber music] [train whistling] Go! Run! Any chance they didn't make it on the train? No chance, because we brought them. [suspenseful music] Hey. Give me something. Anything, a weapon. You know I can fight. No. We will fight. You will testify. And go to jail. Come on! Front. I'm out! [Ganzorig grunts loudly] [Serik] We haven't seen Tenzin yet. Get rid of these handcuffs. [light suspenseful music] Where is everybody? They're dead. Okay then. So, tell me. How are you doing? How did you lose your way? You left us... and found a woman... and now you're working with the cops. This is my own business. Did I offend you? I could have raped and killed her. You should be happy for her. I'll give you one last chance. Leave. If I go... what happens next? I will testify against Arslan. You know Serik... you always were a pussy. And it's just so disappointing. It's gonna kill you someday. You've got two options. The first. I kill you. The second. I kill you. [chuckles] I'll take the third. Just like old times, eh? Come on. [suspenseful music] Are you dying? No. But you are. Look at the mess we made. There's something stuck in your back. Sorry. See you soon, brother. [hammering] I'm calling this court to order. The court acknowledges that this is a high profile case. To be clear... This trial will be conducted according to the law of Mongolia. And only by the law. Your Honor, excuse me. This has been a witch hunt against my client from the beginning! Therefore, we request the case to be dismissed! I would like to remind you that the deadline for any new witness testimony is at noon. Your Honor, due to dangerous and violent circumstances, our operation has been slowed down. There are still lives at risk as I speak. Yet, my men will bring the witness to court. We've waited long enough. The prosecution has yet to produce a single witness. You can't expect my client to wait forever. We've filed our request to the judge. [door opens] [people clamoring] [cameras clicking] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] There are more whores here than people. Here in the countryside? Here in my country. We are not used to these sort of things here. The shootings, the mayhem. Do me a favor, Ganz. Don't ever get used to it. [suspenseful music] [goats bleating]
