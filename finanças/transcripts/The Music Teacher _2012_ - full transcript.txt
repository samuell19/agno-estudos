UH... NO? I GUESS NOT. UM... WE DO REALLY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. YEAH. OKAY. GOOD-NIGHT. MY DRIVER'S OUT FRONT. [CHUCKLING] OH... OKAY. [PLAYING NOTES] [♪♪] I KNOW IT'S REALLY HARD, BEING AROUND US. BUT WE REALLY NEED YOU, MRS. DALEY. THANK YOU. YOU CAN CRY, MRS. DALEY. IT'S OKAY. IF I WERE YOU, I'D BE CRYING ALL THE TIME. DOES SHE HAVE A TEMPERATURE? NO. SHE WAS FINE UNTIL MRS. DALEY ASKED HER TO SING WITH ME. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE WAS TOO SICK TO PERFORM. THAT'S WEIRD. YOU TWO USED TO SING AND DANCE TOGETHER ALL OVER THE HOUSE WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE. MAYBE SHE REALLY IS SICK. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MAYBE SHE'S SICK OF ME? NO, BABY. [♪♪] [DEE DEE]: I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL BE HOME, BUT I'VE GOT MY KEY. MOM, HE IS SITTING RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME. MY MOM WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU LOOK LIKE YOU DO ON TV. AND MY DAD WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU DO YOUR OWN STUNTS. YEAH, I WILL ASK HIM THAT. MY MOM WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COME OVER FOR DINNER SOMETIME. I'D LOVE TO. HE SAYS HE'D LOVE TO. MOM, I'M AT A TABLE, AND I REALLY HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ON THEIR CELL PHONES AT THE TABLE. SO I'M-- OKAY. BYE. SORRY. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE SHOW AT ALL. TONIGHT ISN'T ABOUT A SCENE IN A SHOW. WHAT'S IT ABOUT? IT'S ABOUT YOU AND ME MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME. YOU KNOW... IT'S LATE. I SHOULD GO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO, YOU COULD STAY. UH, NO, THEY'RE CLOSING, SO... I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT THE DINING ROOM. I GOTTA GO. WELL, MY DRIVER'S GONE, BUT I CAN CALL YOU A CAB. OH, NO, NO-- I CAN GET MY OWN CAB, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM. BUT, UM, THANK YOU... AND GOOD NIGHT. YEAH. OKAY, YOU'RE TRANSFERRING 10,000 FROM THE SCHOOL FUND ACCOUNT INTO YOUR BUSINESS ACCOUNT. [MRS. DALEY'S VOICE]: YOU'VE BEEN HURT IN YOUR LIFE, BUT THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU LICENSE TO HURT OTHERS. WHY NOT SURPRISE EVERYONE AND BE BETTER THAN THEY EXPECT YOU TO BE? MR. HALL? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WANTING TO DO? I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I'M DONE? YES, SIR. OH, THAT POT ROAST SMELLS DELICIOUS. I FIGURED THE ONE THING YOU DON'T GET OUT THERE IS MIDWESTERN HOME COOKING. THAT'S FOR SURE. IN L.A., THEY ALWAYS TAKE YOU OUT FOR DINNER, THEY NEVER HAVE YOU OVER. THIS IS A REAL TREAT. CHEERS. CHEERS. THIS IS NICE. [CLINKING GLASSES] OH, NANCY DURHAM'S HALLOWEEN PARTY. THAT'S ME AS MADONNA. ARE YOU IN HERE? NOPE. WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE GONE, IT WAS AWESOME. I DON'T THINK NANCY DURHAM EVEN KNEW I EXISTED. I BET SHE DOES NOW. YOU DON'T SEEM WORRIED ABOUT BEING ALONE IN HERE WITH ME. MY PARENTS ARE RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS. YOU KNOW, SOME GUYS MIGHT TAKE THAT AS A CHALLENGE. YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM, YOU'RE YOU. [CHUCKLES] AND WHO, IN YOUR OPINION, IS THAT? A GUY THAT WAS HARD TO LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT TURNED OUT REALLY NICE. HARD TO LIKE? [STAMMERING] YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YEAH, I MEAN--. I DON'T MEAN IT AS AN INSULT, I'M COMPLIMENTING HOW YOU TURNED OUT. DID I HURT-- I'M SORRY, DID I HURT YOUR FEELINGS? I TOTALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT-- I LIVE IN HOLLYWOOD. I DON'T GET HURT FEELINGS. BUT IT'S GETTING LATE, I SHOULD GET GOING. SURE, YEAH, I'LL WALK YOU OUT. NO, THAT'S OKAY. I'LL THANK YOUR PARENTS ON THE WAY OUT. SEE YA.

RUN-THROUGHS ARE ALWAYS HARD, THIS WAS NO EXCEPTION, BUT WE'RE COMING ALONG. I WILL SEE YOU ALL TOMORROW NIGHT. OKAY? AND, JACE, WOULD YOU MIND STAYING AFTER? I NEED YOU TO HELP ME WITH SOMETHING. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, MRS. DALEY. THANKS. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY. GOOD NIGHT, KIDS. LOOKS LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND WAS KEPT AFTER SCHOOL. MY BOYFRIEND? OH, PLEASE, WE WENT FOR DINNER THAT ONE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE SHOW. KAREN TOLD ME YOU INVITED HIM TO DINNER AT YOUR HOUSE. NO, MY PARENTS INVITED HIM OVER. THEY GOT AN AUTOGRAPH OUT OF IT. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE FOR DINNER. WELL, IF YOU'RE THAT HARD-UP FOR A POT ROAST, YOU CAN COME OVER ANYTIME. OKAY, SO I HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THEN? WORRY ABOUT WHAT? YOU AND HIM. [CHUCKLES] YOU SHOULD HEAR YOURSELF. THE IDEA THAT JACE AND I ARE... I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA DO? HE'S GONNA WHISK ME AWAY TO HOLLYWOOD IN HIS DESIGNER LUGGAGE? FOR A PROFESSIONAL ACTRESS, THAT WAS NOT VERY CONVINCING. I'M NOT ACTING. [CHUCKLING] LET'S GO. JACE, THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD. YOU'RE A WELL-KNOWN ACTOR, AND I'M A HIGH-SCHOOL DRAMA COACH. IT'S PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME TO CRITIQUE YOUR PERFORMANCE, BUT... ABOUT YOUR APPROACH HERE, WHY ARE YOU SO TENTATIVE? MY APPROACH? YEAH. YOU'RE A CONFIDENT ACTOR, BUT HERE IN REHEARSALS, YOU SEEM TO HAVE A LACK OF CONFIDENCE, YOU'RE KIND OF RUBBING OFF ON ZACK AND DEE DEE. WHAT'S... WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I'D COME BACK HERE, AND WITH WHO I AM NOW, THAT EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, BUT... IN A WEIRD KIND OF WAY, IT'S WORSE. YOU KNOW, BACK THEN, I COULD HANG ON TO THE FUTURE, AND HOPE THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE BETTER. I MEAN, YOU HELPED ME DO THAT. BUT NOW IT IS THE FUTURE, AND HERE I AM, AND I GOT THE SAME OLD KNOTS IN MY STOMACH. MAYBE IT'S JUST WHAT SOME ACTING TEACHERS CALL "A SENSE MEMORY." CAN IT HELP ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT BEING HERE? I CAN'T DO THAT. ONLY YOU CAN DO THAT FOR YOURSELF. BUT WHAT I COULD DO IS HELP YOU OWN THIS ROLE IN THIS SHOW. AND MAYBE THAT'S A START? ...MRS. DALEY HASN'T SETTLED ON COSTUMES, BUT I WAS THINKING THAT WE COULD GET MATCHING OUTFITS MADE UP, WITH YOURS BEING LIKE THE CHILD'S VERSION OF MINE. MOM, I CAN'T DO IT. DO WHAT? IT. THIS. I CAN'T. CAN'T? DON'T WANT TO. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT. MOM, JUST PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME DO THE SHOW. LOOK, THE COSTUMES WERE JUST AN IDEA-- IT'S NOT THE COSTUMES, IT'S THE WHOLE THING. IT'S THE SHOW, JUST DON'T MAKE ME DO IT! WILL IT WORK WITHOUT HER? THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT WAS, WE WERE DOING IT TOGETHER. YEAH, WELL, YOU THINK IT'S JUST STAGE FRIGHT? NO, IT'S MOM-FRIGHT. WE WERE GOING TO BE ONSTAGE TOGETHER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN... NICE. BUT APPARENTLY NOT FOR HER. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME FEEL? HONEY, NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE THE GROWN-UP. MOLLY'S THE KID, SO HER FEELINGS KIND OF GOT TO COME FIRST HERE. WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE KID'S RIGHTS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE MOTHER'S RIGHTS? WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHTS? YOUR RIGHTS FOR WHAT, TO STOP OUR DAUGHTER FROM GROWING UP? BREAKFAST AT NIGHT. WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN YEARS. WE USED TO LOVE IT. REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU POURED HOT COFFEE ALL OVER YOUR PANCAKES? I THOUGHT IT WAS SYRUP. [LAUGHING] THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY. I BET YOU WOULDN'T THINK SO NOW. NO. NO, I PROBABLY WOULDN'T. TELL ME SOMETHING. DID I USED TO BE A NICER PERSON? WE USED TO HAVE MORE FUN. WE DID HAVE MORE FUN, DIDN'T WE? YOU KNOW, BEING IN THIS SHOW AGAIN, IT'S REALLY GOT ME THINKING ABOUT THE WAY THINGS WERE. YOU KNOW? WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUT. ME TOO. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BAD THING. I'M GOING TO MAKE MORE DECISIONS WHILE DRINKING. [LAUGHING] I'M KIDDING. HEY, I, UM, I ASKED MRS. DALEY HOW SHE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING. AND? SHE SAID THAT WE WERE AS GOOD AS WE INTEND TO BE. I TAKE THAT AS AN INSULT. WELL, AN INSULT WOULDN'T BE HER STYLE. WHAT WOULD BE? A CHALLENGE. [YELPING AND LAUGHING] [GRUNTING AWKWARDLY] [GROANING IN PAIN] OKAY, THIS WAS SO MUCH EASIER IN MY OLD TRUCK. [LAUGHING] WE WERE YOUNGER WHEN WE WERE IN YOUR OLD TRUCK. WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO DINNER WITH JACE. THERE'S MORE ROOM IN HIS LIMOUSINE. ARE YOU KIDDING? HE'S A WEIRDO, I COULDN'T PICTURE BEING WITH HIM LIKE THIS. SO, YOU HAVE TRIED TO PICTURE IT? [SIGHS] COULD YOU JUST GET OVER THIS WEIRD THING THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT JACE GALLER, PLEASE? OKAY. I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. WHO WOULD YOU RATHER BE WITH, ME OR JACE? ARE WE IN HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT NOW? SO YOU'D RATHER BE WITH HIM. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I THINK I'D RATHER BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

HIGH SCHOOL KIDS, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. AND YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST KEEP THIS BETWEEN OURSELVES, AND EVERYBODY ELSE, UH... WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. [SIGHING HEAVILY] SO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY MY STUDENT ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. [SIGHS HEAVILY] IT'S MY FAULT, YOU KNOW. OH, YOU MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER TONIGHT? IT'S KIND OF ABOUT ME, BUT IT IS SO RIDICULOUS. IT'S NICE FOR THE EGO TO BE FOUGHT OVER. LOTS OF EPIC POEMS AND GREAT NOVELS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THAT. NOT ABOUT ME. SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT, DEE DEE? UH... I'M NOT SURE I WANT EITHER ONE OF THEM. OH, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DATING. I MEAN LIFE. WHAT IS IT YOU WANT IN LIFE? I DON'T... I'M NOT SURE I KNOW ANYMORE. [CHUCKLES RUEFULLY] WELL, YOU LEFT TO PURSUE A CAREER, A REALLY DIFFICULT CAREER, WHICH IS GOING WELL. BROADWAY? AND NOW A NEW SHOW-- THERE IS NO NEW SHOW. DID THEY CANCEL IT? NOPE, UH... NO, UH... [CHUCKLING AWKWARDLY] THERE NEVER WAS A SHOW. I, UM... I HAVEN'T WORKED AS AN ACTOR, OR A SINGER, OR EVEN IN A CHORUS FOR... THREE YEARS. AFTER THE SHOW IN NEW YORK CLOSED, I COULDN'T GET ARRESTED, SO I MOVED TO CHICAGO BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT RENT WAS CHEAPER, AND... I COULD JUST WAIT TABLES UNTIL THE NEXT ACTING GIG CAME ALONG. [LAUGHS] AND I'M STILL WAITING. THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE MY PARENTS SENT ME THE MONEY FOR A PLANE TICKET. SO, WHY HAVEN'T YOU GIVEN UP? I DON'T KNOW. BUT IF I HAD KNOWN THAT IT WAS GONNA BE AS HARD AS IT TURNED OUT TO BE-- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT? I'M NOT SURE. I THINK YOU ARE. BUT GO AHEAD, FINISH THE SENTENCE. IF YOU HAD KNOWN THAT IT WOULD BE SO HARD, YOU WOULD HAVE..? I WOULD HAVE BEEN... STRONGER. [SNIFFLES] I THINK YOU'RE STRONGER THAN YOU THINK YOU ARE. THINGS WEREN'T WORKING OUT IN NEW YORK, SO YOU MOVED TO CHICAGO. THAT'S NOT GIVING UP. THAT'S RE-BOOTING. DON'T FIGHT THAT, ACCEPT THAT. YOU DID SOMETHING THAT I COULD NEVER DO. YOU'RE STRONG, AND YOU'RE SMART, AND YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF IN SPITE OF YOURSELF. AND I THINK IT'S TIME YOU STOP PRETENDING THAT YOU DON'T. [SNIFFLING] THANK YOU. [CHUCKLING] [SIGHS HEAVILY] [MRS. DALEY]: SO, WHY DO YOU TORTURE JACE THE WAY YOU DO? HE THINKS HE'S SO GOOD AT, LIKE, ACTING AND SINGING AND STUFF. YOU DON'T THINK HE'S VERY GOOD? HE'S GOOD, BUT HE NEEDS SOMEONE TO TAKE HIM DOWN A PEG. HAS THERE EVER BEEN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU'VE THAT FELT LIKE YOU WERE REALLY GOOD AT? I WORKED CONSTRUCTION IN THE SUMMER RENOVATING AN OLD BUILDING. IT TURNED OUT PRETTY GOOD. SO YOU KNEW YOU WERE GOOD AT IT. YEAH, I GUESS SO. AND DID YOU NEED TO BE TAKEN DOWN A PEG? [BRAKES SCREECHING] JACE GALLER. HEY, IT'S, UH, ZACK. I'M AT YOUR HOTEL. [JACE]: WHAT'D YOU DO, STOP AT HOME AND GET A GUN? [GRUMBLING] MEET ME AT THE BAR. YOU WERE SO TALENTED, EVEN BACK THEN, AND YOU WERE SMART, YOU GOT GOOD GRADES, YOU KNEW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO, AND THERE WAS EVERY REASON TO EXPECT YOU TO DO IT. THAT'S WHY YOU PICKED ON ME? HELL, YES, AND YOU WERE A CRY-BABY, WHICH HELPED. [CHUCKLING IN WONDER] I ALWAYS RESENTED YOU. I MEAN, YOU WERE COOL, TOUGH, GOOD-LOOKING, ALL THE GIRLS LIKED YOU. GIRLS DIDN'T LIKE ME. NOBODY LIKED YOU. I KNOW. LOOK... I ACTED LIKE A REAL JERK EARLIER TONIGHT, AND I'M SORRY. THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE TO SAY. THANKS. I MEAN THAT. I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY. I CAME VERY CLOSE TO STEALING SOME OF THE MONEY YOU BROUGHT. HOW CLOSE? ALL THE WAY TO THE WALK-UP WINDOW. WOW. COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT, THOUGH. WHY? IT WASN'T MY MONEY. NO, WHY WERE YOU GONNA TAKE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE? CASH-FLOW PROBLEM. I WAS GONNA PUT IT BACK OVER TIME. BUT IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT, THEN WHY TELL ME? GET IT OFF MY CHEST. AT THE RISK OF WHAT I MIGHT THINK OF YOU? [LAUGHS] HOW MUCH WORSE COULD IT BE THAN WHAT YOU ALREADY THOUGHT? [CHUCKLES] YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED MONEY, - I COULD LOAN YOU-- - I'VE GOT A LOAN. I'M UP TO MY EYEBALLS IN DEBT, BUT AT LEAST IT'S HONEST DEBT. JUST LET ME HELP YOU OUT. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL-- YOU'RE RICH. OKAY. JUST SHUT UP. PLEASE. OKAY, FORGET IT. I DON'T FEEL SO BAD NOW ABOUT TAKING YOUR PART IN THE SHOW. YOU FELT BAD? NOT REALLY. YEAH. I DID FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY ABOUT MAKING A PLAY FOR DEE DEE. I MEAN, I SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING HAPPENING BETWEEN YOU TWO GUYS, AND I JUST... I STEPPED RIGHT IN THERE. I CAN'T COMPETE WITH YOU. I MADE A FOOL OUT OF MYSELF TRYING. I'LL JUST, I'LL BACK OFF. NO, I'M BACKING OFF, ZACK. I MEAN, MY INTENTIONS WEREN'T HONORABLE. I CAME BACK TO SETTLE SOME OLD SCORES, AND ALL I REALLY DID WAS MAKE MYSELF FEEL WORSE. [SIGHING] DON'T GO BACK TO L.A., JUST NOT YET. STAY AND DO THE SHOW. YOU MEAN THAT? YEAH, AND I WILL SHAPE UP AND BE A GOOD SECOND-BANANA. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF SHAPING UP TO DO. DON'T PUSH IT. CHEERS. [GLASSES CLINK] [KNOCKING FURIOUSLY] [SLURRING DRUNKENLY] WE NEED TO REHEARSE FOR OUR BIG NUMBER. ZACK NEEDS A LITTLE HELP. GUYS, GUYS, GUYS, GUYS! THE PLACE IS PACKED. YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THE WHOLE CITY SHOWED UP. REALLY? I SHOULD PROBABLY HAND OUT CAMPAIGN FLYERS AFTER THE SHOW. I'M KIDDING, I'M KIDDING. LISTEN, STOP IT. REMEMBER, LISTEN FOR YOUR CUES, REMEMBER TO SMILE, BUT MOST OF ALL... HAVE FUN. HAVE FUN... [ALL FIDGETING IN NERVOUS EXCITEMENT] PLACES! OKAY, HAVE FUN, HAVE FUN! PLACES, PLACES, YES?

I DECIDED TO GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE. [CHUCKLES] AH! HI, GUYS! WELL, YOU'VE COME MORE THAN HALF WAY TO MEET US, SO LET ME SPEAK WITH THE BOARD AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO. THAT WOULD BE GREAT, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, I'M A VERY BIG SUPPORTER OF MRS. DALEY'S PROGRAM. [CHUCKLING] DID I TELL YOU HOW RADIANT YOU ARE TONIGHT? I BELIEVE YOU DID, BUT I COULD HEAR THAT AGAIN. I COULD EXPRESS IT BETTER IN PRIVATE. HOW ABOUT... MY HOUSE... IN ABOUT AN HOUR? DON'T LET ME FORGET TO RETURN THIS. NO, THAT'S YOURS. FOR KEEPS.
