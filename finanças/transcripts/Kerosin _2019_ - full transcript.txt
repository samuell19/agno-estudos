Pyotr Ivanych. Did anything happen? Did I do something wrong? KEROSENE Chapter 1 SPECKLED HEN Hello, auntie. Are you still breathing? I am. - Where shall we roost tonight? - At the old woman's. - Maybe we'll make it to the hostel? - Her place is fine. Is something burning? When will you go blind from vodka? Without vodka you'll go broke like your neighbors have done. - What do you care? - Maybe I wish to marry you. Do you see that nail? Hang your wish on it. Come again. We'll be around for another 3 hour. Go already. - Shmel, stop dawdling! - I'm coming. Still alive? Have you no shame to live that long? - Hello. - Hello, grandma. We came in time. The old hag has the full house today. We really won't make it selling only vodka and sausages. Grandma Pavla... Why are you limping? My husband stomped on me. Your husband... What did you do about that? Hushed him so the neighbors wouldn't hear it. The neighbors? He stomps on her with both feet and she cares for the neighbors. Sit down, Pavla. Drink for your husband's memory. A trucker mustn't think about death. Memento more. Like, when I drove a petrol lorry, I smacked into a dump truck in a bridge. Can it, Styopa! Drink. All the fuel went down into the river. Just imagine, the entire river went up in flame. A river running with fire. -Beautiful! -That's bull, man. Water doesn't burn. Vodka does though. Look. What is it, grandma? My village granny is scared to death of fire too. You don't have a granny. All of you came from another planet. It's called Scrupiter. Grisha, pay up, will you? I'll exit at the cemetery. Not yet! We'll ride some more. I've never seen such a thing. Water burning! Why are you so surprised? There's an ocean of petroleum beneath us! An ocean! Poke a stick into the ground and it'll fountain up at you! - That's what we live on. - You especially. I don't mean myself! I mean our country! It's history's gift to us! And screw NATO! When they took everything out, we'll fall down. All to hell. You're a backward person, Styopa! Drink. We'll leave tomorrow morning. Let them wait. If it reached the sea, the sea would've flamed up too. And the Earth would've become the Sun. Come on! That's it, auntie, I'm done. I'm closing the shop. We didn't make it long on your customers. Call us when you are getting married. We'll come to your wedding. It's for the better that they've closed the store. Truly a hole in the wall. Those truckers would've burned your house down one day. Or made you a drunkard. Lidusya, will you bring some kerosene next time? Now they only make kerosene for construction work. A bottle costs almost as much as vodka. Grandma, we brought candles. They burn very prettily. Your mad granny is afraid to burn candles. She thinks a candle will fall down when she sleeps and burn the house. I've asked you to treat the grandma kindly. Our Porozhki village did burn down from a single candle. Only chimneys are left. So your chimney will be your light. Will you stay the winter with me? You'll share Polinka's room. Oh no, my girl... How can I leave the house? Mother, I'm getting married. Polinka is all grown up, see? How can I leave her with him while I'm on trips? My girl... -Mother, I'm pregnant. -Bye. -Bye, grandma. -Take care. Chapter 2 PYOTR IVANOVICH'S NEW ORDER Missis! Where's the toilet? I've been holding it half across Russia. Thanks. Thanks. What are you doing? Get in! Get in. Sorry, I can't give you strong liquor for free. I'll take whatever you can give, Zinovya. Oh no. Wake up! Hello! Father should've hit you more while he was alive. He left you limp. And you want to cater to his every whim. First to gather drunkards from the street. Now to get a pig. A piglet. Piglets grow. - How will you care for it? - I'll be helping grandma. You keep quiet. Guess what, grandma. Your granddaughter wants to go to Europe. -She wants to become a queen. -And I will. No, mother. It's silly to spend your pension because of your dreams. I bring you everything you need anyway. So forget about it. But he comes to me in my dreams. I see many dreams too. Breakfast is ready. Look, the queen. Hello. Hello. Are you her mother? Very good. It's like that: for the record, mother, if she keeps the baby, she won't see me ever again. She got it from who knows whom on her trips and I must bring it up? Why would I need wood? I have gas heating. You'll find some use. Did you really love your old man so much? To obey his every single word... Well, here you are... Come on... Eat, little one. That's it... Easy now... Good boy. Eat some more. Easy now. I can't see your mouth. Come on. Eat. Can't you eat? You're so weak because you don't eat enough. Get up! Chapter 3 IVAN THE FOOL - Granny, it doesn't work. - Doesn't matter. Take it for its gold if not for its work. Perhaps, you'd better take a piece of salt pork? I need a piglet. A strong one, so it would stand on its feet. A strong one, huh? Alright, I'll give you a piglet. Good. - Where shall I put it? - Right here. Take a seat. Buy him a ticket or else your piglet will steal the ride. Thank you, son. - Bought a piglet, ma'am? - I did. - Congrats. - Thanks. Gran, is that your stop? Yeah... Are you trying to kill yourself? Yes. No, don't cancel anything, under no circumstance. I will be there no matter what. I won't leave. I was born here. It's my god damned country. I'm going to work here. I won't yield to them. I've put too much my and other people's effort into it. They have to earn for themselves, we've fed them enough time. Go on! Yes, darling, yes. I've been to the doctor. Would you like a cup of coffee? Yes. What could he tell me? Don't cry. Please, don't cry. I feel fine. -You have a nice house. -It's Ivan's house. It's nice. What does he do? Petroleum. Do you have any kerosene? I think Ivan Ivanych's plane is fueled with kerosene. I can ask at the airfield. That's out of the question. I'm not going to call anyone and ask anyone for anything. Yes, Kostya is with me, don't worry, bye. - Kostya! - Sorry. Everyone, come quick! Ivanych, Ivanych! Call for an ambulance! Ivanych, what's wrong? Ivanych, Ivanych! Chapter 4 TROUBLE - Grandma, hi! - Hello, my dear. - Where is your mother? - Off on a trip. She left for Chita for two weeks. - With her husband? Oh god! - He studies there. Grandma, I think I'll move to your house. - What about your mother? - She doesn't need me. It's fine. - What about school? - I won't end up illiterate. I'll move my things to your place tomorrow. My queen. Hello! Chapter 5 LIVING WATER Chapter 6 DEAD WATER Hello, granny. We got lost. We're students. Gonna kill that hag. It's counterfeit. I'm going to the kitchen garden. What the hell? Where are you? I can't see anything! I can't see! Grandma! Grandma! - Where are you? - Grandma, where are you? Chapter 7 KEROSENE Hello, grandmother. Is that you? We're her at Ivan Ivanovich's order. Bring it here. Where is Ivan? Ivan is here no longer. He died. But we have something else for you. Currently the quotes fluctuate around $49 per barrel. Will it reach $50, a psychologically crucial mark, according to the economists? KEROSENE
