CHINA, DURING THE SINO-JAPANESE WAR, A BITTER POWER STRUGGLE TEARS THE COUNTRY APART. VICE PRESIDENT WANG DECLARES A NEW GOVERNMENT. BACKED BY THE NVADING JAPANESE ARMY, THIS PUPPET REGIME TRIES TO LURE AWAY OFFICIALS FROM CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S CAMP, TO FURTHER GAIN FAVOR WITH HIS JAPANESE MASTERS. WANG BRUTALLY CLAMPS DOWN THE RESISTANCE THAT SEEKS TO RETURN CHINA TO THE CHINESE. AS THE PUPPET REGIME GROWS MORE TYRANNICAL, THE RESISTANCE COUNTERS WITH INCREASINGLY BLOODY ASSASSINATIONS. THE MESSAGE OCTOBER 10, 1942 THE NATIONAL HOLIDAY Sorry. We're closed tonight. How come? We're trying to celebrate. The whole restaurant's booked. Got it? Even General Tang has joined us? And he's not the only one, of course? You know? General He... and the rest of them. We're beating back Chiang Kai-shek and his men in every battle. His government won't be able to hold out much longer. President Wang holds you in the highest esteem. He sent me here to invite you to join him on the viewing platform at the ceremony. He would be most honored even if you're only there briefly. President Wang needs the support of people like you. Go ahead! The Chungking-style chicken here is the genuine article. You've been holed up in the North too long. Have a taste! Mr. Fan, I need your answer now. "Wang's Intelligence Gunned Down by Rebels" "Imperial Officer Poisoned" ?Terrorists Strike Down Imperial Officer" "Rebels attack the Imperial Research Center" "Transport Facility Destroyed in Rebel Bomb Attack" "Japanese Imperial Officer Axed" JAPANESE MILITARY POLICE DEPARTMENT Smells nice... Doesn't it? It comes from Sri Lanka. Drives our Puppy crazy. Now tell me , because you will sooner or later? Who do you get your orders from? Puppy. Go. Colonel Takeda. You must be Mr. Six. I'm a great admirer of your work. You're too kind Col. Takeda has a remarkable command of Chinese. She's a tough one. We've tried everything at our disposal. She won't break. Then Mr. Six is the man for the job Don't let me keep you. Just turn these assassinations over to the Chinese authorities. You'll be sent back to the Home Islands soon enough. Don't get mixed up in all this Gen. Tsukeda, sir? The head of the Resistance... is a man, code-named Magnum. Though he's never exposed himself, he is behind these assassinations. I've got a strong feeling that Magnum has a mole in our operations. Feelings are for women, Takeda. Feelings don't have any place in war. My part in the war is almost over, sir! This would be my last chance to redeem myself. I cannot return home as a failure, it would bring shame to my family That woman finally cracked. She's with Magnum alright. She says they get their orders from a message board, in front of the city temple. The orders are written on a lottery flyer. That sounds like their M. O. We found this in her home. Has she ever met the person who posts the flyers? She bumped into him once. He's an old cripple. CITY TEMPLE Commissioner, I've seen the cripple before. He's a janitor at the Counterinsurgency Center. Retreat! Yes sir! Mission abort! Mission abort! You did the right thing. If you'd taken him in, we'd have lost our only lead If the person who posts the flyers is a janitor at our Counterinsurgency Center, then we can also presume that he's getting his information from someone else working at the Counterinsurgency Center. Correct. Our sources say their codename is Phantom. The next move is ours. The recent surge in planned terrorist acts suggests a problem with our intelligence channels. General Osamu Tsukeda, The Imperial Army, invites Commander Zhang of Counterinsurgency Center and personnel involved, to meet at Bai Cao Hall... on October 31, 9pm. We shall discuss ongoing intelligence efforts. COUNTERINSURGENCY CENTER. Li Ningyu, Head Officer of the Decoding Section Gu Xiaomeng, Administration Officer of the Decoding Section Commissioner. It's ok. Wu Zhiguo, Chief Captain of Counterinsurgence I know.. Jin Shenghuo, Section Chief of the Military Office Bai Xiaonian, Aide to the Commander of Counterinsurgency For the Commander. CITY TEMPLE, TWO DAYS LATER Tsukeda meet all together at Bai Cao Hall on October 31 Request assassination plan from Magnum Wait. Moving now. We have to go. Now? Yes. Where the hell are we? Spooky. It used to be called Qiu Manor. The Japanese have taken it over now? Turned it into their own little pleasure palace. High-ranking officers only. Looks like this is serious matter. And someone's? ...going to be in for it. What makes you say that? Didn't you see? The Chief of Special Services is here too. Chief Wang. Good evening, everyone! May I suggest that you go to your rooms and freshen up first? We'll meet in the conference room in half an hour. What do you mean, freshen up? Let's just get the meeting over with? ?so that we can all go home. Patience. Ms. Gu. Just go to your room first, if you would. All right. Lieutenant Bai-- That room. Chief Jin-- This way. Chief Captain Wu-- That way Where's ours? I'm still feeling sick. Fairy shed light on heaven's secrets. Win every time with White Dove lottery tickets 3-6-4-4-5-6-0-2... What is this all about? Total gibberish. The Imperial Army intercepted this coded message this afternoon At first glance, nothing more than an ad for the lottery, but according to our intelligence, it contains a message from an underground organization, regarding a new wave of assassinations. We've asked all of you here to help us crack the code before it's too late. You must be joking. None of us here are cryptographers, except for Officer Li. What did you bring us here for? To play mahjongg? Officer Bai. this order came directly? ? from the upper levels of the Japanese Army. It would be best if everyone fully cooperated . Does Commander Zhang know about this? No. The commander is in Nanking on business, until the day after tomorrow. All these numbers? Don't look at me, I don't know anything about codes. What about you? Not in my area of interest. I specialize more in blackjack, mahjongg? ? that kind of thing. Li? Li. You're the expert here. What do you say? It's no good. We can't crack it. These numbers have obviously been encrypted. There are 18 characters in total, to decode what they're meant to be, we'd need the codebook. Otherwise... We could be here for days and still come up with nothing. Did you hear that? Go tell the Japanese we can't help them. I want to go home. I don't have time for this nonsense. I've got a sweep to go out on tomorrow. Col. Takeda. Who's that? The head of intelligence for the Imperial Army. It's a pleasure to meet you. A consummate professional, indeed. Here's the codebook. Shall we begin? 7-8-7-1 Got them. Jin? En. What are they doing there? They're, um, uh. Enough with the um-ing, what is it? You've heard of Morse Code? Get on with it. Now, Morse Code is used for telegrams all over the world. With Chinese, it works a bit differently. Each Chinese character is represented by four digits. There are seventy-two digits in this telegram, total of eighteen characters. But the sender deliberately scrambled the digits before they sent it out. Now, Li over there is trying to figure out? ? the algorithm they used. Once she's got that, she can decode the message. One ? Zero? And? This can't be. What's wrong? Tsukeda and all to gather at Bai Cao Hall on October 31. Request assassination plan from Magnum. What does it say? They're planning to assassinate General Tsukeda. We set a trap -- a telegram with false summons to a meeting with Tsukeda. The mole in our office took the bait, and sent this to their co-conspirators. You five are the only ones who had any contact with the original message. Which is to say? one of you is the mole? who's been leaking intelligence? under the name Phantom. Whichever one of you it is, just confess! I promise you'll be treated humanely. You'll forgive me, but I have my orders. Nobody leaves the building, until the Phantom is found. Who are you writing to? You scared me. Dear sister, what are you writing a letter for? We'll be out of here in two days. I'll go find Liu myself, and give him a piece of my mind. Do you really think we'll be out of here in two days? Sure? It's not hard to guess who this Phantom is? Tea? You've got a split seam! On the left. I'll stitch it up for you. Take it off for me. Wow, that's a big one! Is there a sewing kit here? I think so? Bingo! Found it! Here, let me help. There you go. You once told me, that your mother wanted you to be a proper lady, right? Yeah. This is the first time I've ever seen you doing anything ladylike. Sis... I don't know why, but I've always felt close to you? especially today... What's wrong? Liu hasn't been by in days. Unfettered in the wild wastes, I mastered yin and yang. and knew the heavens. What are you singing? The Empty City, it's an old Tangshan ballad, from Leting Sing some more. Well? Would I be rewarded with a smoke? Here. But when the country needed me, I fought... to cast out the pretender to the throne... Why, Captain Wu ? I never knew you were from Leting. What? You too? My grandfather always used to sing that when I was little. No kidding? What a coincidence. With all the people in the headquarters, we hardly ever get the chance to talk. I never thought I'd meet someone from my old hometown here. It must be fate. There are plenty of people from around there in the headquarters. but not necessarily from Leting village It might be just us. Yeah. Say, after we get out of here in a couple days, I'll take everyone out to celebrate. My treat. Has Li made a move yet? Still mooning over, her actor boyfriend, Liu. Gu just said she knows who the Phantom is. She seems a bit off. A bit spoiled, you mean. She comes from money. As for Officer Bai? He's got friends in high places too. So I've heard his relationship? with Commander Zhang.. ? is indeed very unique. I SLIPPED UP MEETING AT BAI CAO HALL IS A TRAP MUST GET MESSAGE OUT IN NEXT FIVE DAYS OR, COMRADES WILL GO TO THEIR DEATHS Come Bai, we're all waiting on you. Here, have something to eat. Quite a spread. Is this supposed to be our last supper? My old friend Bai, always the joker. That pretty little head of yours, js just full of jokes. You can count me out, I'm no spy? I faint at the sight of chicken blood. You think I'd join the resistance? Wang? You know me. This section chief position of mine? It's bullshit. I got it through connections, you'd know better. My wife's related to Commander Zhang's wife on her father's side. See? This all has to be a mistake, I've never heard anything about any Phantom. I mean, maybe it's the Japanese that have the mole, right? It couldn't be any more obvious. Section Chief Jin is the one you want. He's the most suspicious of any of us. Why? He has a nephew who joined the Red Army when he was only 15 He's become chief of staff at their headquarters in Yenan. Fence-sitter that he is Jin must still be in contact with him. He's been keeping a mistress, for years, with money from weapons smuggling. Do I look like I'm joking now? I've got dirt on everybody here, including yours. What a rough job you have? Here all on your own. The others are downstairs for backup. Backup? As if we were dangerous. I need to make a phone call? just a short one. No can do. It's just to call home, it won't be long, I promise. You can even listen, if you want. I told you, it's not an option. Fine. Then I won't trouble you. Here's the number to my house, and a list of the things I need Can you call them for me and have them bring my things here? Pretty please? Ms. Gu, we need you to come with us. I don't know ? I mean? I'm not sure? Can't be certain? What do you want me to do? Make something up? No, no. Certainly not? You were the one who delivered the telegraph, just try and think back. Did you notice anything suspicious? It all went according to protocol, nothing to be suspicious of? What were you going to say? Nothing. You paused, something came to mind? Captain Wu saw the telegram. Go on. When I handed the telegraph to Chief Jin, Captain Wu was with him. Normally? A classified telegram would be eyes-only? ? for the officer in charge But that day... when I delivered it to Chief Jin, Captain Wu didn't look away. He actually glanced at it briefly. He shouldn't have done that, but then again... It's probably nothing. Do you know how much blood I've shed all the years? I've served President Wang? I was shot three times. It's little weasels like you we should be watching out for. Who knows which side you'll end up on, if the tables turn? I see. Until we catch the Phantom, we're all still colleagues here. You rank above me ? just above me? And so I am showing you? ? the respect you deserve. Let's hope you leave here safely. Ask whatever you want, but the answer will be the same? I don't know anything. I checked, it's the number to the Gus' house. What about the list? Anything suspicious? Looks normal to me. Don't call her family. Send someone to buy the things she's asking for. What if the others start making similar requests? None of them would have the nerve. What does her family do again? Her grandfather was with General Xu, her father went into business? Textiles... Cement. Shipping? You name it! They say he's close to President Wang. Just last year, he donated a JU-52 to the Air Force. He donated a plane? That's what I call rich. Let's make dinner more interesting. Before they go down, tell everyone what the others have said. Including Gu saying she knows who the Phantom is. Why aren't you eating? What's the matter? Once a bitch... ?always a bitch. A mincing, conniving little bitch. Councilor Jin? who are you talking about? The faggot knows perfectly well, just exactly, what I'm talking about. You're spoiling? my appetite. I'll rip your fucking head off! Calm down Chief! Let him come! The coward. We'll see how hard you can get! Stop it! You want some whipping? We're all colleagues here. Stop! Stop it! Calm down! Colleagues, my ass! I'm no colleague of a slanderous... rumor-spreading bitch! I was merely... ? stating the facts. Facts? I'll give you facts! I was shot twice last year at the battle in Yueyang, but I still kept going. Didn't back down till I took out the enemy pillbox. Where were you then? Sipping tea and reading the newspaper in your fucking office. Then whoring around after work, I bet! Captain Wu, being a brave soldier doesn't mean you're always right. Remember Deputy General Gao? A hero in every battle he fought, even lost an arm for us, but he still went to the other side in the end. Say that again! Say it again! You're calling me a traitor? Just giving an example. You don't need to volunteer yourself so quickly Take it easy, Captain! Stop it! Get out of my way! Out of my way! This is no business of yours. Go ahead! Let's see what kind of a hero are you? If you're so strong, why don't you go? ? pick fights with the Japanese, instead of women? Captain Wu. May I suggest you finish your dinner first? A man raises his hand against a woman, and nobody does anything? There's no need for this, we're all amongst ourselves. NOBODY WILL MAKE IT OUT OF HERE ALIVE NEED TO TAKE EXTREME MEASURES TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF GETTING MESSAGE OUT... We truly apologize for the? ? inconvenience to you all. Col. Takeda has specifically directed? ?after the Phantom is found? ?each of you will be rewarded for your assistance. If you'd all be kind enough? ?to write down your ranks, pay grades? ? and evaluation scores? ?during the years of your service? ?you'll all be rewarded accordingly, once this is over. What do you want? What's going on? Let go of me! Who'd they get? It's not me! It's really not me! Well, then can you explain to me? ?just why your handwriting is identical to the Phantom's? Well,? ?someone's framing me. It must be! It must be! Pull his pants down. Hold your step Commander I'm disciplining my dog What's so funny about that? There's a rat in your unit. What rat? General Tsukeda has asked me to take full charge of this. Commander Zhang? I'm afraid the General's faith in you... has been greatly shaken. Do you have evidence? Bring over the handwriting file. Now! If it were anyone else, this would already be over, but since it is Lieutenant Bai, your confidant... ?I think it best if you prove your innocence first, Commander. Commander, help me! I'm not the Phantom! Officer Li, please get dressed immediately and come with me. Where to? One minute. You have one minute to get ready. Please wait here. Please enter. We have a situation, sir! One of our men Just saw Captain Wu barging into Gu's bedroom. See anything? It's too dark. Turn it up! I'm apologizing to you. I don't want your apology. Please just leave! Why? Why can't we just talk it out? What are you doing? I'll call the guards! I'm their commanding officer, what are they going to do to me? Let go of me! Let go! What's going on? We're losing the signal. Your boyfriend, Liu, the actor? You haven't seen each other for about a week, no? No He's with the military police now. What's he doing there? What do you think he's doing there? Commissioner! Why didn't you stop him? I didn't dare, sir. Knock on the door, and ask Captain Wu down to the living room. Tell him I would like to speak to him. Go! Yes sir! What is it? Commissioner, sir! No, sorry, I mean, Chief Captain, sir! Commissioner Wang would like to? ?talk to you in the living room. Tell him I'm sleeping. HUMAN ANATOMY The first time I saw you, I noticed your features? ?a narrow forehead... ? high cheekbones? ? and a thin nose. Your eyes are deep-set. Women with that kind of facial structure? ? are not to be trusted, even if, on the surface, they may seem to be above reproach. You've been acting, all along. What do you take Liu in for? A unit like Counterinsurgency, can't allow for any uncertainty. If you share your bed with a rebel, what else might you be sharing with him? Ms. Gu? Ms. Gu, are you asleep? What do you want? Just passing by? Are you ok? I'm fine. I brought you a snack. If you need anything... I'll be around. To hell with him! If you can prove that you're not the Phantom, it would also clear up our suspicions about Liu. I suspect the resume you submitted to us... ?was mostly made up. During the interrogation today, your hostility? shows only that you're hiding something. You're one of our best code-breakers, I'm told, but did you know that... Every inch of the body carries a code? If you can pass this examination, you and Liu will have nothing to worry about. Your physical features, from every orifice to every limb, all carry the genetic code of who you are... ?showing our true identities. In order to get to that, first I'll need to break your will. And the way to break your will is to help you realize that your body does not belong to you. It belongs to your enemy. Now, let go! Give yourself over completely! "Wherefore, there in her shimmering eyes of jade, shine golden pupils peering at my own?" HAVE COME UP WITH A PLAN HEAVEN HELP ME NOW So, Lieutenant Bai died during the interrogation? Is that correct, Commander Zhang? Right up, until he died,... ? Bai insisted he was being framed I've wronged him! Everything we did for the Imperial Army, and this is how you repay us? What else did Lieutenant Bai say? He said the hell with handwriting, Chief Jin is a master calligrapher? He could imitate anyone's Handwriting, he wanted to. My condolences. Please take the Commander home. Rest well, Commander Zhang. We've been had. The Phantom is still among us. We have two days left. No more mistakes, Colonel Takeda. ONE MONTH AGO Takeda! Takeda! Any thoughts you'd like to share with us? Forgive me for being so direct, but I don't believe that your plan is feasible. Nothing comes quickly or easily in battle. The cost of a rushed attack would be staggering. Your opinion comes? ? as no surprise to me. Your grandfather killed himself on the Northern front-lines. Cowardice seems to be a Takeda family tradition. We have a situation! The cripple is here! The janitor who posts the messages at the temple? I checked with the administration? ?he handles the slop-water here. However, he's not supposed to be here... ? until the day after tomorrow. He's swapped his shift with someone else. The Phantom's gone quiet? They?re getting worried. The Phantom must be anxious to notify the rebels not to carry through the assassination. Here is our chance to set a trap and force the Phantom forward. Attention everyone! After three days of investigation, we have made great progress. We are now almost certain that Lieutenant Bai is the Phantom. As a gesture of appreciation for your cooperation, Col. Takeda has arranged a special lunch for today. Please be punctual. Thank you. Hey you! Go tidy up the dishes and bring back the plates. I, Li Ningyu... ?graduated with honors from Wharton, I am not a whore. I am not! I may not share your rank... ?but that doesn't mean I'm afraid of you? Sis. You bastard! It's all right now. Bastard! Let go of me! Come now! It's ok. Let go of me! It's OK! No way I'll surrender myself. These goddamned people. We should? ?just kill them all and have done with it. It would make no difference to me, but I would worry for you, Commissioner Wang. One innocent officer has died already. If we should take another life... ? and still find no sign of the Phantom? What would you tell, Commander Zhang? Let's go over the facts again! I believe we can rule out Officer Li, I've looked her over carefully. The only thing on her mind is her boyfriend. Someone so weak-minded, couldn't possibly be the Phantom. What about Jin? He looked at the old cripple... ? when he was handing him his dirty plate. Look at it the other way? ?Jin has nothing to hide! If he looked at the cripple, that only shows one thing, he is unguarded! When a stranger comes close, it's only natural to react. If someone doesn't react... ?they?re deliberately avoiding it, trying to control their focus. Neither Captain Wu nor Officer Gu? ? looked once at the cripple, throughout the whole meal. One of them is our Phantom. Everyone come outside. Gather at the west wing immediately. To prove his innocence, Lieutenant Bai gave his life right up until his death. He insisted that he was being framed. Lieutenant Bai was very close to the Commander but even that couldn't save him. I suggest you all ask yourselves, with nothing to lean on, how will you escape his fate? Merciful Buddha! Whoever it is, please. I beg you ? step up! Spare the innocent! We would rather be wrongly harsh, than wrongly lenient. If the Phantom wants to leave there are two ways: in a box, or in? What the?? Motherfucker! Is there anything you won't do? Calm down, Captain Wu! Everyone will take their turn. My friend... ?stay away! Stay away! Don't come close! Stay away! Stay away! You don't want to do this, Jin! I know what you do to people. It'd be worse than death. I'd rather end this here. Another one down. What do you want? What are you doing to me? Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Sis! Let go of me! Sis! Let go of me! Let go of me! Go back to your room! Don't say a word! Go! Why aren?t they making a sound? You dropped a cigarette at lunch. What are you talking about? There was a message on the cigarette? Are you out of your mind? How many more innocent people will you let die? Officer Gu, what did I ever do to you? Why are you always against me? It's not about you? I'm just saying what I witnessed. What the fuck did YOU witness? The cigarette is coded. I'm going to give it to them. Officer Gu! No one else should have to die so you can live! You bitch, I'll kill you! Go! Yes sir! You too! Yes sir! The door is jammed! Out of the way! Let go of her! Let go! You fucking whore! Fuck you! If only you'd spoken out earlier, there?d have been no need for any of this. Give it here. During lunch yesterday, the chief captain took out a cigarette? ? and dropped it on the ground. I could sense that something was going on, so I covered it with my foot. Morse Code? Yes. In Morse Code. This represents a single word. "Abort" There are plenty of smokers in this building, but you?re the only one who smokes "Three Cannons". Come on... I?ll give you one more chance? ?for the sake of all our time together. That bitch stole my cigarettes to frame me. I don't know shit about codes. You?re all fucking blind! She's playing you! Just confess! Takeda has assured me that if you'll only confess, you can be pardoned, maybe even rewarded. Our formidable Captain Wu? Too hard for electricity. Come? Let the Chief Captain down! THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO TODAY Gu... It was a close call last night. I've sewn up the rip for you, but I'm not very good at it. The stitching is a bit... ? uneven... You've been targeted... Both you and the Chief Captain. Captain Wu hates my guts. He's always antagonizing me. I know it isn't Captain Wu. Don't worry, I?ll never turn on you. Here, try it in! When did you know? Just now. It was a blind guess. Mr. Six. Ah, Chief Captain? Long time no see! You?re aware of Mi. Six's... pride in his work It's not too late for you to confess. Fuck you and fuck your ancestors! I?ll come back, and fucking kill you in my next life! We're not strangers, Captain. You were always generous to me, so I'll be... restrained. Now relax... Breathe deeply! Relax, Chief Captain... Tell me? where is Magnum? This one's good for the kidneys! So my boyfriend is one of you too? You sent Liu to me? You've been using me all this time? Why me? I rank too low, can't get enough access. We hope you'd become one of us. This is beyond me. Was anything real? I've always thought of you as a sister. As a sister? If they knew about this conversation, you think I'd make it out alive? They already got Liu. Had you heard? Huh? Where are you going? To turn you in. I am going to turn you in. Fantastic! To die by your hand. Is probably the best I can hope for. You?re a monster! I was only doing my job, I didn't want it to go this far either. Magnum! Where is Magnum? Right... here! You've already made it? They think Captain Wu is the Phantom. I was the one who sent out the bad information. Now I need to get the word out to my comrades. There?s only one way, turn me in. I would never do that! What are you thinking? How could a message be worth more than your own life? Huh? Your life? Huh? I don't care... What other people do with their lives? But I want you to live! For the first time, I can finally open up to you... If only for a few more days and nights... ? to talk with you, heart to heart. But there's no time left! Do you understand? No time! I'm begging you, turn me in! Usually, three needles is all it takes. For an ordinary man to confess and fingerprint their testimony. The Chief Captain? ?is indeed a remarkable man. Is there any other way? ?to make him talk? Open the gate! Let me in! I found this under Officer Gu's pillow... The Chief Captain is innocent! Hurry up! Flip him over! Unfettered? ?in the wild wastes. I mastered? ?Yin and Yang, and knew the heavens,... ?but when the country needed me, I fought. You smoke Camels? and yet, Officer Li found a pack of Three Cannons under your pillow. That's awfully damning I'm trying, really trying, to help you here? ?but? ?we're running out of time! Those aren't my cigarettes! Get her up there! Stop! She won't talk. How do you do, Phantom-sensei? We meet at last. How long have you been spying at the Counter-Insurgency Center? Do you take orders directly from Magnum? I can guarantee you? ?full protection if you cooperate, not only for you? ?but also your family. I can guarantee that! Let's not get carried away now, Takeda! During a strategy meeting, you assaulted a superior officer. You?re about to be deported back to Japan, where you'll probably face court-martial. You?re in no position... to guarantee me anything. Let me put it this way? ?when I say I can guarantee you? ?and your family safety? ?I am also saying that? ?I am in a position? ?to hurt you... ? and your loved ones. Hello? There must have been a delay on the road, 20 minutes later than planned. Number 6, South Bank? That's your parents' address, isn?t it? Leave my parents out of this! This has nothing to do with them! A call for you? Mother... Right now. Another gun just like this one? ?is pointed at your mother head. Your decision? ?save her life and you can save your own. Enough! Tell Madame Gu, her daughter will be home soon. You see, that wasn't too hard, was it? I am the Phantom. I take my orders directly from Magnum. Captain Wu never laid eyes on the telegram, I made that up to frame him. As for Lieutenant Bai, I was the one who forged his? Let's talk about Magnum. Where is he now? OK, but not in front of him. I have no idea where he is. I've never seen him. But you must be? ?in contact with him. The board in front of the City Temple, does he post the orders himself? What do you think? Would you do it yourself? You?re wasting my time! Sorry, but the truth is I know more about you... ? than I do about Magnum. Commander, sir! Where is Takeda? I need to see him now! What else can you tell me? Oh, lots... About your family, your upbringing... ?and about that awful weak spot of yours... Your grandfather became Lieutenant General after the Meiji Restoration, your father also distinguished himself? ?as a Colonel in the Navy. Indeed, you are a most talented spy. Halfway through the Russo-Japanese War, your grandfather killed himself in the front-line. No military men have ever respected you. You bitch! Don't shoot! She was determined to die, and we all played right into it. You never had any authority to conduct this investigation. General Tsukeda turned down your request? This operation? is entirely illegitimate! At this point, does it really matter? ? whether I was authorized or not? My goal? ?is to catch Magnum, and wipe out his terrorist organization. I cannot return to Japan in shame. You conducted interrogations under false military orders. Two ranking officers died here, along with a Chief Captain who's half dead. If word of this gets out, they'll haul both of us before a court-martial. We need to find someone to pin this on. Sirs. I have matters to discuss with Col. Takeda. Leave us be! Yes sir. You double-crossing son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Takeda! Colonel Takeda! You know I've? ?I've always been loyal? Back-stabbing bastards! At least the Phantom wasn't able to escape. Stick with the original plan tonight. Set a trap at Bai Cao Hall. If we can catch Magnum? ? we might still have a chance. THREE MONTHS LATER Where did you last make port? Taiwan? Saigon? No, not Saigon? This ship doesn't stop there. What's the point of sending more troops in? This war just might end earlier than we'd thought. I'm going home a criminal, but I've got it better than you? At least I'm going home. I'm here to shorten the trip. "Peace at Last"! Li Ningyu! Li Ningyu! Li Ningyu! There?s someone here for you. You know how it is? After working for the puppet regime during the war? ?I'm really pretty lucky? ? to have even this. The report you wrote helped a lot? I should thank you. Poor Liu, though? The Japanese were going to put him in front of a firing squad,? ?but three days before the execution? ?the Japanese surrendered. He kept his life alright, but he's never been the same. Anyway, you're not here to hear me complain Actually... ?I'm here about the dress. The dress? The one Gu mended for you. Gu and I. We were both in the resistance, although we were both undercover in the Counterinsurgency Center. She had no idea who I was. It wasn't until that night on the balcony, when I started singing "The Empty City", That she learned I was one of her comrades. We use the song like a secret password? ?to reach out to our comrades... ..whenever we were in trouble. Relax, now. I lost my temper. I'm here to apologize. I don't want your apology. Please just leave! What are you doing? Just relax. I?ll call the guards! Stop! What are you doing? Are you trying to threaten me? I'm their commanding officer. What are they going to do to me? Let go of me! Relax now, let?s sit down and talk it out. Let go of me! Relax! We're both from the same village. I won't do anything to harm you, let go of me! Let go! Back off! Just calm down. I know you?re the one? ?but I beg you, comrade to comrade, hide yourself. Let me take the heat. Try to get the word out. But it was me that sent out the false intelligence. I should support the consequences. You couldn't stand the torture. You?re in no position to tell me what to do? I only take orders from Magnum! Then why was Gu? ? always clashing with you? It's one of our tricks, if two comrades are taken in at the same time, we fight, accuse each other, do whatever it takes? ?to keep them from getting everyone. That way, at least one of us would get out alive. Let go of me! If word doesn't get out tonight, the resistance will be crushed. You must survive, find a way to get the message out. I am MAGNUM. I hereby order you to turn me in. You stay alive, I have a plan. You dropped a cigarette at lunch. What are you talking about? There was a message on the cigarette. Are you out of your mind? I didn't understand at the time what she was trying to do. She'd decided from the start that she'd sacrifice herself, yo make sure I got the message out. That song, "The Empty City", with a few changes in the tune and lyrics, became a tool for transmitting urgent messages. BAD INFORMATION ABORT MISSION MAGNUM When Gu made you turn her in, It was to make sure that I got out. What if you'd been unconscious when you got to the hospital? Or nobody was there to hear your message? Then it would all have been for nothing. In fact, Gu had also sewn a mission abort message? ? onto her undergarments? ?as another way to get the word out. BAD INFORMATION ABORT MISSION PHANTOM Nobody was going to get out of that mansion alive, So Gu, used her body to pass on the message in death. She also wanted me to pass on the message she left for you. It's in the lining of your dress. You'd know this better than me? It's all Morse Code. THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO TODAY I'M NOT AFRAID OF DYING? BUT ONLY FEAR, MY LOVED ONES WON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE DIED FOR I AM LEAVING THESE WORDS IN THE HOPE THAT LI AND MY FAMILY WILL FORGIVE MY DECISION I am leaving these words in the hope that? ?Li and my family will forgive my decision. But I have faith, that you will come to understand my intentions. My dearest loved ones... ?though my death brings you great pain, but our people face mortal peril. I would do anything to stop it, even if it's giving up my little life. Whatever they may do to my body, my soul will always live on with you. What the enemy can never understand is? ?that Phantom and Magnum represent not individuals. They represent a brotherhood and a faith in justice. Subtitles By: Dan4Jem
