(CROWD APPLAUDING) [NARRATOR] Here he is, the toast of Hollywood, Jackie Jason! Hey, do we have a show for you tonight. The ever-popular Solly Jim, fresh from his big smash week in Vegas. And Grant Boyer, a sensational young illusionist. Hey, how bout that mess in Washington? Crazy stuff, huh? Wow, Solly Jim! I wish my wife were here to meet you, but she's leaving me. She thinks I'm a nutcase. God, what is happening to my life? You seem depressed, Grant. [GRANT] It's a mess! I'm at the end of my tether. -(SOBBING) Oh, God. -Oh, God. Look at that. You know where that stuff comes from? Well, it all starts when you wear a tight-collared shirt. The shirt depresses your Adam's apple until you yawn, which allows sunlight to hit the back of your throat. A patch of tiny hairs grow there, that eventually becomes a hair ball that falls into the stomach, where it rolls around, and exits through the stomach escape-hatch. The mix of hair and gunk flows into the small intestine, where it tickles the sensitive walls, and is ejected at the speed of sound and hits the rib cage, which aims it at the belly button. If the velocity is sufficient, it squeezes through the bounce off your shirt, and gets lodged in the belly button. And they found eight chickens in his pants. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Here he is, folks, Mr. Vegas himself, Solly Jim. How do you tell when you're at a bulimic bachelor party? The cake pops out of the babe! (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Did you hear about the artist with a bad case of psoriasis? He asked the model to come up and see his itchings! (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (YAWNS) Boy, this is a tough audience. My career is over if I don't get a laugh on this next joke. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) (PLAYFUL MUSIC) Here's my impression of a sock. (LAUGHING) My mother always warned me about playing with myself.

Just remember, kid, if you see someone without a smile just give 'em one of yours. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) [MAN] You've got a nasty boil here. That won't do for national TV.

Undressing your mate is a very delicate matter. It must be done subtly, yet with authority. I recommend the diversion technique. Hugging and caressing are intensely exciting to the frauleins. And when done properly, can leave a lasting impression on the affaire du coeur. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUN SHOTS FIRING) [GRANT] Hmm, that gives me an idea. (EXCITING MUSIC) Aha! (LAUGHING) No, no, no, no! No, no, no. No, no, no. (SMACKING) (ENERGETIC MUSIC) (LAUGHING) [NARRATOR] The nipples. Oh, the nipples. Just a light touch with the thumb and forefinger, and they stand erect... -Oh, God, Jesus! -Alone without shame. Wow, that hurts! Proud to show themselves off to the world, as if to say to anyone around. -Oh, boy, my eye. -Here I am. Fondle me, kiss me. Love me, caress me. Take me to the heights of sensual ecstasy. Exotic accessories are a very important aspect to proper mating. They insure that the male is appropriately excited. Such things as spiked heels, fishnet stockings and tassels add an exotic and forbidden aura to the sex act. Be playful. Have fun with them. That's what they're for. They help spice up the sensual feast of pleasure. (CHORUS MUSIC) Now that the preliminaries are out of the way, the mood is set. It's now time for the ultimate act, the supreme gift of oneself to another. [SOLLY] Keep your shirt on, I'm coming. Grant, my boy! I've gotta use your phone. Some army is trying to kill me. And Keri thinks I'm from Mars. So, are you married? Keri is almost divorced. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? [GRANT] Let me talk to Keri. I know she's there. Oh, its you, well. It's Grant! My, aren't you impulsive! [GRANT] I'm so depressed. My marriage is over. (SOBBING) You know where tears come from? When the eye sees something sad, really sad, tiny light balls travel to the brain through the optical canal. The brain heats up and releases sad little flakes. They fall through the sadness artery into the heart. The heart, heavy from these brain flakes and bodily fluids, falls, whomp, onto the bladder, which sends a microscopic wave to the upper part of the body. Some goes to the mouth and causes a frown, and the rest goes to the brain, which is hot with sadness. The fluid hitting the hot brain produces condensation on the cranium's surface and it slides down an exit through the eye opening as tears. You see this bump? It gives me these super powers. But now that I'm with you, I'm safe. (PHONE RINGING) [SOLLY] Mr. Giles, he's here. You want me to bring him in? (BEEPING) You've found him? Yes, he's where? Mmm, what's your hurry, big fella? I love a man in uniform. Something about slimy scales really makes me moist. Mmm, do you like french kissing? [MOTHER] Oh, aren't they cute? (MOANING) [MR. GILES] Colonel, where are you? We're waiting. [MOTHER] She can get a divorce. So can I! (TIRES SCREECHING) That's a nasty bump on my head. I'll have to use medication on that for sure. Then my hair will fall out, so I'll have to use hair tonic and then hair remover. And I'll flake, so I'll have to use a salve. And my pores will open up, so I've gotta apply body ointments and skin creams, and I'll bloat and my skin will fall off. Oh, boy. Scabs and pus all over the place, and my face will turn into jell-o and I'll break out. Please, please, please. Help! Thanks, Grant. [MR. GILES] Don't be so naive, Solly. Just because you brought Mr. Boyer in, you thought someone of your minuscule talent could have his own show? [SOLLY] Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, funny boy? Not so fast, or I pull the trigger. -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah? Okay, this is getting us nowhere. Let's all drop our guns on three. One, two, three. Come on, we must trust each other. One, two, three. Okay, I'll drop mine first. Come on, guys. Let's shake and let bygones be bygones. (BUZZING) (SCREAMING) At last, to be the funniest man on the face of the earth. (SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC) So this guy walks into a bar with a duck on his head. Bartender says, what'll you have? So the duck says... Get this. (LAUGHS) Well, he split a gut on that one, Colonel. The lobe, please. Now I can set the world right. Now for some throbbing military power. Whoa, whoa. Oops, oops, whoa, oops. Whoa, whoa, oops, oops. Wait, this is too bulky. All I need is destruction at my fingertips.
