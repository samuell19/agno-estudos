You won't be saying that at breakfast. - Water's rising too fast. - I know where it is. - I'll be quick. - No! Dad, the water. It's alright, darling. Your mother knows what she's doing. She won't be long. Jarah, stay here. I'm going for your ma. Jarah, do as I tell you. Stay here. I won't be long, OK? I love you. Ah! Father Patrick says kissing is the devil's work. - It is. - Until you're 21. I'll never be that old. Not if you stay cheeky. Let us begin. Paddy. We'd like to have a word with your, uh... flock.

You and your children will be reassigned to properties where help is needed. Postings are all nearby. My wife needs a seamstress. We just live around the corner. This is... I'm gonna alert the church superiors about this. I am your superior. You will bend the knee, my son. Sister, if you could assemble the children. - Of course. - No! They go soft or hard, either way. You decide. Good girl. Now, don't worry, little chickens. We're going to have a lovely picnic. There'll be swimming and tea and cakes. Alright. You go with them, alright? And you do what they say. Your dad and I will come find you. Alright? Now, listen to me. You be good. No cheeky. Be quiet, invisible. Alright? You do what they say and they won't hurt you.

That morning, as the sun came up, it was as if though that tree had caught fire, and as you took your first breaths, that golden light shone in your face and you were the most beautifullest, powerfullest thing we'd ever seen. And we knew right there and then that you too would grow tall and strong just like that jarrah. Are you ready for this? Show me. You remember everything I've taught ya? - Of course I have. - Right.
