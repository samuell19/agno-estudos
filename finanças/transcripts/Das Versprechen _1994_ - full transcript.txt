[**] [THUNDER RUMBLES] WOMAN: When the world was young, between a sea of sky and a land of snow, lay a kingdom where gods and man lived side by side. In this land, a crown did not always make a king, and armor could be just a disguise. Dukes dreamed of treason. Mighty generals fought bravely but without honor. Battles raged for the love of a beautiful woman. The line between friend and enemy was often blurred. And even an innocent young girl could lose her way. Promises made in those times were heard by the gods, and so, of course, were lies. [**] [BIRD CHIRPING] [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] [GRUNTING] [HORSE NEIGHING IN DISTANCE] [WINGS FLUTTER] [BUZZING] [HORSE NEIGHING IN DISTANCE] [CROW CAWS] [GRUNTING] [GASPS] Aha! Fell for my trap, you stupid girl. Give me back my bun. Did you think you could take these and no one would notice? I've seen you stealing them. It's mine, give it back. I want it! [LAUGHS] Finally got you. Heh. You can't have these. They're not yours. [LAUGHS] You silly girl. That's my bun, and I want it! [CHUCKLES] Well...it's yours if you can get it. Nyah-ah-ahhh! Whoa. If you put me down I could get it easily. No, you couldn't. I think you're scared. Well, we'll see about that. [GIGGLES] [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Come on, take it. That's a beautiful helmet you have there. Can I hold it, instead of the bun? Hey, so you wanna hold my helmet instead? Hm. All right. You've got a deal. [GIGGLES] Hm. Here you are. [YELPS] [**] We had a deal! I'll-- I'll never forget this! [**] [BIRD CHIRPING] [CRYING] [**] WOMAN: Don't cry, Qingcheng. Do you know who I am? I am the Goddess Manshen. Show me your hand. Would you like another bun? [GASPS] Eat your bun. It's for my mama to have. Your mama is...dead. Sorry. She will not need it. [THUNDER RUMBLES] But little Qingcheng must not die. You must go on living, now. Mustn't you? You don't want to continue stealing food from the dead? Mm-mmm. Do you want to be someone's servant? [**] My child... the Eye of Infinity controls each individual's destiny, every contour of their fate, their every smile, every tear, including yours. You could have the most beautiful clothes. All the riches of the world will be yours, and everyone will adore you. I can promise you all these things for a small sacrifice. You will not experience true love. Should you discover it, you are destined to lose it. Do you accept this? All right, then. Then, it is done now. It is set in the concrete of time. Your fate is sealed. You should know, though, you can't reverse it. This cannot be undone, unless rivers of bitter tears run upwards and you can outrun time. [**] [HORSES GALLOPING IN DISTANCE] Captain Yeli, what is that I hear? Savages. Savages? Where are they? Hiding. How many are there? Ten thousand. Oh, ten thousand? Against one thousand? Do not worry, soldier. You are indeed fortunate to be of the one thousand. The unlucky savages are about to face our Great General. [COINS CLINKING] How many slaves have you brought? A hundred and thirty. I'll take them all. A fair price for dead bodies, yes, but... They are dead bodies. They won't survive the battle. Uh...wh-what's going on? One hundred and thirty-one pieces of silver. Take it. Thank you for the extra silver, general. No, it's not extra. Adding you to them that's 131 dead bodies. Tell them to stand. They don't know how to stand, only kneel and crawl. [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] [GUANGMING CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS] [BLOWS] [GRUNTING] [SLAVES GASP] [CHUCKLES] I shouldn't give you this. The one who earned it was I. Would you like it? [LAUGHING] [HORN BELLOWS] SOLDIER: The alarm! Where do we go? To the valley... as bait. And when you're dead, we shall attack. [GASPS] [LAUGHS] Ah-- [**] [MEN SHOUTING] [GRUNTS] YELI: Cavalry to the fore! Archers, prepare! [**] [BELLS CLANKING] [FALCON CRIES] [WHISPERS] What's wrong? [SNORTS] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [BEE BUZZING] Mm? Listen. [BEE BUZZING] [GASPS] [BELL CLANKING] Run! [SLAVES MURMURING] Now... what's going on? What is it? [HOOVES GALLOPING] [BUZZING STOPS] Listen... protect me. All right? [LAUGHS] Yes... master. [**] [ANIMAL SNORTS] [GASPS] [SLAVES SCREAMING] [BULLS ROARING] [YELLING] [BARBARIANS CHEERING] [SCREAMING] ONE-EYE: Kunlun! Save me! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] ONE-EYE: Kunlun! [YELLING] [WHIMPERS] [KUNLUN GRUNTING, PANTING] ONE-EYE: Up the hill! Kunlun, go up! ONE-EYE: Kunlun! Fire! SOLDIER: Don't let them escape! Those slaves have been ordered to deflect the first attack. [**] YELI: Those stupid barbarians don't realize this valley is shaped like a horseshoe. [ROARING] [BARBARIANS WHOOPING] The slave has overtaken the bulls. He's guiding them back to the savages. SOLDIER: Great General, those-- [HORSES NEIGHING] [BARBARIANS WHOOPING] [YELLING] Charge! Keep running, slaves! [ROARING] [SHOUTING, CHEERING] [ALL SILENCE] Hey. One's alive. [YELPS] BARBARIAN: They're our bulls! BARBARIAN 2: Run! [SCREAMS] [BARBARIANS SCREAMING] [**] [HORSE NEIGHING] [**] [SOLDIERS CHEERING] [SOLDIERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BIRD CHIRPS] [**] Whoa. He's expired. That means he's dead. Why still carry him? He was my master. What's your name? Kunlun. Where from? Don't know. Family? No, sir. How long have you been a slave? Always. I suppose you'd like to be my slave. Really? Of course. But first tell me why? I could eat...every day. [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHING] From now on... you are Kunlun... my slave. Yes, master. Also... no more kneeling. For me you will run. [WHINNIES] The duke of the North has attacked the Imperial City. And the king? He is unharmed but trapped inside. His Majesty commands your immediate return. Very well. Then I shall leave now. Kunlun. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER CRASHING] [NEIGHS] [WHINNIES] Same tree again. We are lost. We will each look for a way out. When you have found the way, fire this cannon. Yes, master. [**] [GROWLS] [GROANS] [GROWLS] [GRUNTS] [GASPS] [GRUNTS] Your armor and your life. I am sent by my master to take both of these things. Take off the armor. [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] [GASPING] KUNLUN: Master! Master. I have found the way. Master, what has happened? Sir? Perhaps you'll give me the helmet. Don't give it to him! You move fast. You're Snow Countrian. Then... we are brothers. [KUNLUN PANTING] He was so fast. You saved my life. You are a good slave. [GROANING] [WEAKLY] Kunlun... I want you to go and... rescue the king. Dress in this armor-- But don't talk. --and rescue the king. The king is...which one? [CHUCKLES] He's the only man with no sword. [**] Your Majesty, where is Qingcheng? I thought you had come for my throne, Wuhuan. Could it be that you came just for a woman? Did you need five thousand of your soldiers to besiege my lands? And all for a worthless woman. You only had to ask me. Did you honestly think I believe one woman is worth going to war over? It is little wonder, then, that in the eyes of the people, compared to General Guangming, you are always second-rate. There's no need for such theatrics. Don't be too confident, Wuhuan. As we speak, General Guangming is on his way here to rescue me. General Guangming was killed. You think that I'd be here, enduring conversation with you, if your dear general was coming? Well, let's just say you're very optimistic. Your general has met with a most unfortunate death. The general's not coming. Soldiers, attack! [**] Stand aside. [**] Who would like to have a princess' cloak as a present? [GASPS] Relinquish your weapons. [**] [MEN INHALE DEEPLY] [ALL SIGH] Good girl. You keep stripping. Do it. Would anyone like to see what I am wearing underneath this garment? Then re-aim your weapons... at him! No. What are you doing? Ah, you'll regret this. [**] No. He's not been killed. [KING LAUGHS] The Great General is coming to my rescue. I'm saved! As for you, bitch. Now you're dead. [SCREAMS] [HORSE WHINNIES] [MEN SHOUTING] You bitch! I'll kill you! [SHRIEKS] [MEN SHOUTING] [SHOUTS] [SHRIEKS] [KING LAUGHING] [MEN SHOUTING] You? [SCREAMING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [MEN CHATTERING] General, well-done. [CHUCKLES] [**] QINGCHENG: Keep going. [HORSE WHINNIES] Thanks you, general. But don't assume, Great General, that I am yours. I'll not be kept in a cage. Besides, your king is dead now. So I'm free. Don't come any closer or I'll jump! No. No, don't die. You must live. Don't die. I want you to live. [HOOVES GALLOPING] Great General, now you're finished. The world now knows that you alone killed the king, general. But if you jump off that cliff and sacrifice yourself, I'll free Qingcheng. I've heard you're too heartless to give your life for another. But... everybody has a weakness. [GASPS] You keep your word to free Qingcheng, and I'll jump. She'll be as free as a bird. [GASPS] [**] [HORSE WHINNIES] General! GODDESS MANSHEN: You will not experience true love. Should you discover it, you are destined to lose it. [CLAPS] Greetings... Princess. [CAGE DOOR SLAMS] How do you like your cage, my little bird? You wear that. [**] [GRUNTS] You murdered the king! SOLDIER 1: Yeah! SOLDIER 2: Traitor! SOLDIER 3: Murderer! SOLDIER 4: String him up! If it were not for you being our general, we would have tortured you to death! SOLDIER 5: Instead, we leave you to the wolves. Well, well, general. I can understand your killing 130 slaves to win a battle. But that you'd kill the king... And only for a woman. You know I wouldn't murder the king. Yes. However, you did. GUANGMING: If that is what you think, then why not just... give me to-- To Wuhuan! Damn it, Yeli! You do have quite a temper. Don't you walk away. Captain Yeli! [THUNDER RUMBLES] [**] Who are you, and what do you want? I am the Goddess Manshen. You shouldn't be so unwelcoming to someone who has come to see how you are. Well, goddess, why exactly are you here? So we can discuss your destiny. Destiny works in unusual ways and cannot be changed? You have been accused of killing your king. Yet it wasn't you. It's cost you your place and honor. [SCOFFS] Now you are to lose even more. You can do nothing. The cherished armor is all you have left, and that too you'll lose. The Crimson Armor will have a new master soon. It is he who will be king of all warriors. And he will outrun destiny to make Qingcheng his love. Well, that's just ludicrous. I have lost no honor. [CHUCKLES] You are wrong. The truth always prevails. The truth, indeed, will prevail, and it will destroy you. It is your destiny. [GRUNTS] [THUD] [**] [PANTING] [HORSE WHINNIES] Yes, I killed the king. Idiot! And what did you do that for? He had a sword, and was going to kill the princess. What were you thinking? You killed the king [ANGRILY] for a woman! [GRUNTS] I should kill you. But not just yet. You go find this Qingcheng, bring her back. Yes, master. Give me back my armor, right away. [GRUNTS] Yes, master. [GRUNTS] [HORSE SNORTS] Kunlun. Don't just stand there like an idiot. Come on. [**] [SIGHS] [**] [GASPS] [GRUNTING] [GASPS] [**] [SHRIEKS] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] [QINGCHENG SCREAMS] [KUNLUN GRUNTS] QINGCHENG: Through that door! [BOTH PANTING] [GRUNTS] [BOTH GASP] [**] And who is he? I don't know who he is. [GASPS] [ROARS] So he is the one that killed the king. [GASPS] [MEN SHOUTING] Stop! [PANTING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [GRUNTING] [ROARS] [MOUTHING WORDS] [ROARING] [**] It appears Guangming has fooled me with his simple armor switch. And the one who posed as him was his slave? Not even a real human being. [MAN GRUNTING] Murdering a king is an ambitious undertaking for a slave. I knew it was you. Are you holding something? [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] We have acquired the item, my lord. [**] Give it back. You don't want it. No. A slave shouldn't become attached to anything, especially his life. [**] [**] [MEN GRUNTING] [GASPS] They've ruined my good fan. Get out. You understand why they had to die? Without them, nobody knows who really killed the king. Of course, you need to kill the slave. Don't you? So that everybody will believe that the general is the true assassin. [WHIMPERS] Wait a moment. If you should fail me again, I may have to take the robe. And with great pain you'd vanish into nothingness. [FAN UNFURLS] Understood. [GASPS] Untying was easy, only I'm locked in. Can you help me? I can. You need to get back in here for me to help you. [SNOW WOLF GRUNTS] You said I'm from snow country. That we are brothers. Well, that's changed. One of us has to die! [KUNLUN ROARS] [**] [HOARSELY] Please. I will help you. [GAGGING] [COUGHS] [PANTING] [SHOUTS] [**] Aren't you afraid I'll try to kill you again? I'm not afraid. You are Snow Countrian. We found only this piece of his cloak, my lord. Where is he? He has fled with the slave, my lord. Find him. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [WATER TRICKLING] [**] [LAUGHING] Tell me why you killed the king for me. Also why you jumped off that cliff. And why you're so kind to me. For your love, princess, I'd do anything you want. I can't fall in love... with anyone. [GASPS] But you are in love with me. [GASPS] What are you doing here? He's my slave Kunlun. I have returned. Good night. Hm. He is the one who saved me. So he should. He's a slave. [HORSE SNORTS] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Kiss me, please. [BIRDS CHIRPING] GUANGMING: Wait! Qingcheng! Wait! Where are you going? Stay here. I can't. Why is that? When I was young I made a pact. I will lose any man that I am in love with. Believe me, general, I am protecting us both by leaving. Let us keep in our memories last night. At least we will have that to cherish. Forever. [HUFFS] Master, I fear that she will not return. That you have lost her. Goodbye. Master... [HUFFS] ...I have nowhere to go. Just go back to where you came from. [**] [WIND WHISTLING] SNOW WOLF: Kunlun... I will take you home... where the snow will restore your strength... and you will learn who you are. You are not a slave. You are a man from the most noble land of all... where there was only light and trust... and honor. Where we ran like the wind and flew as free as birds. I'll show you the land of your ancestors, the Land of Snow. [**] [CAWS] KUNLUN: Mama? [GASPS] [GROANS] [WIND WHISTLING] I just dreamt of my mother and a little girl. What is this place? Where are we? This is your homeland, Snow Country. I had to run through time to show you exactly who you are. Snow Country? But what happened? Well, that was your home after you were taken and sold into slavery. The little girl was your baby sister. Not long ago it was all destroyed by a cruel duke. Is she here? No. KUNLUN: Who are you? SNOW WOLF: The cursed man who wears the black cloak. The only one time cannot outrun. The only one. Well, I need to see how my mother is and my sister. You must learn to run then. If you learn power and speed, I dare say that you'll see them. I run with power. What you show me is... slow. You must have inspiration, then you will run with power. What is inspiration? You must discover this on your own. I have taught you all I can. [BIRD CAWS] As long as you remember all I've said. Kunlun, just one last thing: True speed is imperceptible, like the blowing wind, like pinpointing the moment winter became spring, or the turning of the earth, or... knowing the minute that you fell in love. Yes, I'll remember. Go now, Kunlun. Go and find your inspiration, that which will make you run. [**] She's gone. [SOBBING] She's gone. She didn't come back. Master, I will take you to her. [**] [HORSE WHINNIES] [PANTING] How could you just leave me? [CRYING] I'm not afraid. I may lose you, but I still love you. I'll never leave you again. I want to know what love is. Are you mine now? I was always yours, from the moment you saved me from the king. [**] [**] I'd like to hear what you said to me-- The thing you said to me. --at the waterfalls. It was when... you said, "live." "I want you to live." [CHUCKLES] [**] KUNLUN: I want to see my mother and my sister. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [EXPLOSION RUMBLES] [ROARS] [GRUNTS] SNOW WOLF: It's no use. What you see has already happened. This is the past. SNOW WOLF: No one has ever broken through the wall of time. WUHUAN: I am the duke of the North, your new ruler. All my life I have admired your ability to fly like the birds and run like the wind. So I have a gift for you, and it's magical. Imagine adding to your current powers of flight and speed the gift of eternal life. That is what this robe brings. Who'd like to be the man who wears it? So who's it going to be, then? Who is lucky? Hello there. Why don't you ask your brother? KUNLUN: What does he want with my sister? You should go back. Be quiet! [**] [ALL GRUNTING] [ROARS] [MUFFLED SHOUTING] [FIRE HISSING] [WHIMPERING] You will be sorry you have rejected my priceless gift with such animosity. I am appalled at your heartlessness and cruelty. [SCREAMING] [**] [ROARS] KUNLUN: Mama! MAN: Wait! I'll wear your armor. Wait! I will wear it! I will wear it! First we must see how fast you run. [WHIMPERING] [WHINNYING] [WHIMPERING] [YELLS] [WHINNIES] Don't run! Stop! You're making it worse! You're fanning the flames! [GROANING] [YELLS] [HOWLS] [CRYING] [YOUNG SNOW WOLF GASPING] I believe you are a Snow Countrian and that you're petrified of death. Only those who are afraid of death make good slaves. Now are you ready? Put on the cloak... and you will live. Yet if you remove it, you will die. [GRUNTING] [YELLING] Now you're my slave, and you'll be as a ghost... to do my bidding eternally. You traitor! [**] [ROARS] You are right to be angry. But not at me, at Wuhuan! I never hurt anyone. I just wanted to live. You're too weak to kill him! You and I are the same, brother. We are not brothers. Wait! [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLES] [BOTH LAUGHING] [HOOVES THUDDING] [GASPS] [**] Hyah! [HORSE WHINNIES] General, sir, we've captured Wuhuan. We need your help. But didn't you leave me to the wolves? General... I apologize. Please forgive us, general. We accused you unjustly. We are deeply ashamed. Forgive us. Please, sir. We need our general, sir. QINGCHENG: Captain Yeli. Great General Guangming has retired. The armor needs a new master. We'd like you to take this if you wouldn't mind. He has always worn the Crimson Armor. Guangming has truly...died. [YELI CRIES, SNIFFLES] [WHIMPERS] GUANGMING: What do you think you're doing? Get up. I'm not going until you come with us. [CHUCKLES] Captain... Well, you could, uh... come with me? Hm? Well, I'm not going. And I won't let you! So let him cry. [POTTERY SHATTERS] [LAUGHING] What if I were to insist on going? [**] [GASPS] [TEARFULLY] Please don't. You can't leave. Then you come too. [HORSE WHINNIES IN DISTANCE] GUANGMING: Let's go! [HOOVES GALLOPING] [MEN SHOUTING] [**] If you're looking for the general, he's gone. Why don't you just go as well? Kunlun! Wait! [**] You must bring him home to me, please. Mm. I'll wait here. [WHINNIES] [SNORTS] SOLDIER: He's in there. [CHUCKLES] [SNORTS] You are so easy to predict. I knew you'd come, and so beautifully dressed. And Qingcheng, is she coming? I had heard you were living happily together in domestic bliss... and without the Crimson Armor. [CHUCKLES] What do you say to that? [WHINNIES] Hyah! Bind his arms. [GASPS] [GRUNTING] Here it is, Your Highness. Thanks, Yeli. Move! [**] Where's your mask? You think I don't know your secret? [GRUNTING] [MUFFLED] Qingcheng! [MUFFLED] Qingcheng! I cannot deny that you are perfectly suited to each other. But you fell in love with the wrong man. [SPITS] Ah! [LAUGHING] General. Did I carry you here so that you could then break her heart? I found where she is, and she is waiting. Since you know where she is you get her. I need you to come with me, sir. We will go together and kill Wuhuan. And rescue her. [SCOFFS] No... [CHUCKLES] ...it's too late. Wuhuan defeated me. My fighting days are finished. [SWORD SCRAPES] Are you going to kill me? Go ahead. As I said, I'm finished. I'd prefer you do it. [THUMP] You're forgetting who you are! You cannot give up, Great General Guangming! Great General is dead. Dead. The Crimson Armor? Where is it? And who would wear it? Me. I'll wear the armor and save Princess Qingcheng. I will also confess that it was I who killed the king. This is what inspiration is. [SWORD SCRAPES] The armor is in the armory. Here you go. Have it. [SWORD CLANGS] When they come to take me to court, I'll see Qingcheng. [SIGHS] I'll wait right here. Go. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [**] [GASPS] Are you surprised? Where were you? Give me the armor. Anything you want you can have, if you are ruthless. Yes? [GRUNTS] But you are not ruthless. [**] I'll have that robe back. I've found someone more suited to wear it than you. What's more, he's always been a slave. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Guangming was yours to kill, yet you failed. Give me the robe! Where are you, coward? Where will you go? [ROARS] [**] That's right. [GASPING] If I were to tug this slightly you... [GROANING] [**] Your choice: Now you release my countryman and the armor, or die. It's yours, man. Easy, yeah? WUHUAN: Wait! Here's your choice: the robe or the armor. Or else... both of you must die. WUHUAN: You betrayed your own people. Then you betrayed the one who let you live. Once a traitor, always a traitor. As you don't want to kill for me, might I have my robe back? WUHUAN: No? Maybe I'll kill you anyway. [ROARS] [SOLDIERS SHOUTING] KUNLUN: Let me go! Let me go! SNOW WOLF: No! Let me go! Please stop! I'll kill him! No! No, just listen! Give me your decision. What is it, the armor or robe? When I told you I didn't... hurt anybody, It-- It was true. And a lie. It wasn't my fault that they killed our countrymen. There was one man... whom I hurt very much, and he's standing here. I must thank you. When you grabbed me by the robe, I discovered death was not really that terrifying. You wear that and wear it well. Show Qingcheng you're the one... [SOBBING] that she should love. [WIND WHISTLING] [WIND HOWLING] Good luck. You're free to go. But only within the palace walls. Kunlun. Please, rescue the general. [**] I can't save him, Qingcheng. [SOBBING] That means he's going to die. If you say the king was killed by me in the trial, the general will then live. But you didn't kill the king. You could say that... the general was wounded, that I wore his armor and killed the king. [CHUCKLES] [**] [CROWD CHATTERING] [CROWD SILENCES] [**] MAN: General Guangming. You were granted your position, great power and many possessions by the king himself, and yet you murdered him. Why? I fell in love with Princess Qingcheng. [CROWD MURMURING] General Guangming, assassin of the king, is hereby sentenced to death by public beheading. This is my final and most glorious victory. [CHUCKLES] He's been lying. Oh, it wasn't he who did it. It was his slave. [CROWD MURMURING] Who's this? I am the slave who killed the king. A lowly slave killing a king? That's outrageous! [CROWD SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] Oh, he did it. Now what reason would a slave have? I wanted him to kill the king... [CHUCKLES] ...because we are lovers. [CROWD SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] [**] It was night. The general was wounded. I dressed in his armor and... And the moment he killed the king, was when I fell in love. He carried me away, and we rode to the waterfalls. Then you held me so close, and you said... You said, "If we are going to die, at least we die together." No. No, that wasn't it. What I said...was, "Live. I want you to live." It was I. I killed the king. CROWD: Arrest the slave! You were right. And then you jumped off a cliff for her. When it comes to love, got no luck, do you? Hm? GUANGMING: Wuhuan... you are sick. It is the court's decision that the slave could not have acted alone. Therefore, all three of you shall pass to Wuhuan. Whereby he shall decide your punishment. Did you think this was going to end happily? You can't imagine how long I've waited for this day. You will be the last thing each other sees. WUHUAN: I have provided food and water. Should you want to eat. Oh, you'd have to get down. I suppose it's out of reach, just like your love, which was destined to end anyway. Qingcheng's a thief and a cheat. You don't remember? I've seen you stealing them. [YELPS] WUHUAN: You lied to me and left me hungry. Because of what you did I couldn't ever really trust anyone again, that includes myself. [MAN LAUGHING] [WUHUAN LAUGHING] I don't think you're in the position to laugh at anyone. [LAUGHING] I'm laughing at myself. Even with all my triumphs, I can't compare to you, Wuhuan. I admire your ruthlessness and ability to stop at nothing. Ah. I always had a dream, you see. It's that you'd wear this black robe. Should I give up that dream, general? No, I will wear it. I'm not lying. WUHUAN: How do I believe you, general? Just believe nobody wants to die. Come down here and put it on, general. [WHIMPERS] QINGCHENG: Kill him! [**] [BOTH ROAR] [QINGCHENG GASPING] [SCREAMS] She'll be dead before you strange me. [WUHUAN GASPING] Put the knife down! [GRUNTING] If you let me go, I'll put the knife down. You can't! He's lying! No, you go first. For once, we should trust each other. [SCREAMS] All right, go. We'll go at the same time. Just once. We'll believe each other. Right? Now you're going to die! No! [**] Only believe nobody wants to die. [**] [GROANS] [WEAKLY] Free them, please. [GASPING] [GRUNTS] [COUGHS] [GASPING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] You were the last of your people. [BOTH GRUNT] They-- Th-they're both going to die. Now you don't get to love anyone. For all your lying and your cheating, you still couldn't change your destiny. [SOBBING] The general is dying. Qingcheng, go to him. [GRUNTS] You can't die. You and I should be as one. Don't die. [WEAKLY] I want you to live. [**] [SOBBING] [WAILS] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [**] We can run now. I want you to have the chance to change your destiny. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Fate can be changed, Qingcheng. Promises made with the gods are just as fragile as the promises that you make each other. Love produces many bitter tears. And through love you have discovered a way to outrun time. Choose again, Qingcheng. And choose well. [WOMEN SINGING GRACEFULLY IN MANDARIN] [**]
