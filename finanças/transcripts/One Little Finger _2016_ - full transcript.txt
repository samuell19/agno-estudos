Take for example the oft-used A-B-C song, which also happens to be "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," it's mnemonic device actually helps children retain the academic principle. - Honey. - What?

So we come to know that it is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas. The bell rang ten minutes ago. You've completely disrupted the class. You are not in proper uniform. Silence. C-A-R-B-O-N D-I-O-X-I-D-E Oxide. - Carbon Dioxide. - You didn't miss a thing. Den, pick up the pencil. Yes, try it dear. Yes, you can. Come on, yes. The school needs to encourage his mind not his handicap. The right solution will come. What is all this, huh? Are we supposed to continue to join the miracle revolution? Hey, Den, take it and you don't say I never gave you anything. Okay? You stubbly. Yes. I'm sorry to say, Sir, that there is no one in the authority here that supports his wellbeing. - Sir. Sir. Den is bleeding. - What? Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, my God! So much blood. There is an institute for cerebral palsy in Kolkata. They have the staff to handle the disability at the same time teach. Avik, it's Kolkata and... and Den is only eleven. What I'm asking is that we look at all options, but there maybe something we haven't tried. - Hello, Doctor. - Hello. Please. - Hello, Den. Den, hi. - Say hello. See, I have contacted Dr. Claudia, she was a colleague of mine. And I have sent all his medical history and she is ready to do the treatment. Den will go through a series of treatment with Dr. Claudia - almost for 6 to 12 months. - Oh. And she is also doing research in alternative therapies. Hmm. These lessons cover everything he will miss. He can be tested any time before next school year. Thank you.

Even though he will always rely on a wheelchair, with some work, we can help him with his speech. Hey, why the sad face? Huh?

A physical disability does not always mean that the brain is disabled. In fact, if consistently and properly engaged it is possible for the brain to teach the body. Den, good boy. Try it. Den is making good progress. Yes, Den. Yes, Den. Try. I can't bear to send him to Kolkata. But he is communicating better, huh. Maybe it will be okay. Hey, come on man. We are getting late. Den is a perfect example of someone, who through therapy and supportive engagement, was able to train his body to articulate what was on his brilliant mind. Let's go. - Do you like football? - Yeah, I love football. They are playing so cool. Come on, here. Come on. Hey, what are you doing? First, we'll attend the festival. People with disabilities often become victims of bullying and harassment. - Look who is back. - Oh, not again. Hey, don't. Oh! See, see what they are doing. They should not do like this. Hey side, move. See. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Hmm. When the body, brain and heart are moved by music, it brings people together. Den, Den what happened? Den, Den. Den, did you take your medication? Den, did you hear me? Den. Let me tell you a story. It was a beautiful day like this, hmm. Suddenly a tremendous storm kicked up, and all the animals started running here and there, except the baby rhino that was waiting for her mother under their favorite banyan tree. Den. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Den. A young elephant got separated from its herd, it took cover under the same banyan tree. The baby rhino got frightened, and then the young elephant brings the branch down and put it over his head to give shelter to the baby rhino. And thunder broke down and the tree was hit by lightning, it then burst into flames. Then the elephant pushed the baby rhino away from the fire. The mother rhino then heard their cries, and she ran over there to save them. Hmm? Now it has been said that the rhino is the last of its kind, saved from the poachers by the elephant's herd. Hmm? Now my point is that, sometimes the best way to fit in with others is to be brave and stand out. Okay. Let's go. Okay, I will be right back. Okay? What happened? Hey, na, na. Women are more vulnerable even at home and they are afraid to raise their voice. You wait here. I will find someone. It is my hope that by bringing to light the value music brings to our vulnerable population that they can move beyond the stigma of somehow being inferior. Wait. Let him be brave. That's one way to stand out, hmm? Hey guys, great session. Take a 5 minute, all right? That was the best. That was like a pure dopamine rush. I mean this gives me an entirely new angle on my music therapy. You know this is proof positive that music sets the brain firing on all synapses. - It's amazing. - Just stop, okay. You sound like a doped-up groupie. Oh, yeah? I bet you can teach me about instruments working together in harmony, maestro. Seriously, I want you to teach me about different frequencies and notes. I mean, they must have taught you some emotional resonance. It was Juilliard, right? All right, you know what? Stop grasping for straws in some twisted attempt to understand me. You are wasting precious years on a guess. Your thesis, you're gonna be a laughing stock. Oh, my God! You're rehearsing a presentation that you have no concrete research on. Grow up. He is suffering from severe depression. It will pass with time. - Hello, Doctor. - Hello, Sir. Yes. It should pass with time. I see no reason not to continue with the therapies. Hopefully, his speech will return as quickly as it disappeared. But, Doctor, the school here will do nothing to improve his mood. Then it may be time to call Kolkata. Hmm. Oh, my God! She's on fire. Yes, I know. Doctor. - Give her some paracetamols. Okay. - Yes, Doctor. Take proper care and take rest at home. - She will be all right. - Thank you, Doctor. - He is Dr. Bhatt. - Okay. And she is Dr. Sen. - She is from Kolkata and she is the director of Hope Institute. - Hello. Test scores, exemplary. Hmm, essays and penmanship, remarkable. Oh, drawing of Anil, the likeness is stunning. Poor Anil. - Let's see her performance. - Sure. She has problems in mobility but she is improving with physiotherapy. Wonderful. She has problem with hearing, but with the vibrations of sound she could play the notes. I would love to meet her before I return to Kolkata. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. - She will be all right. Okay. - Okay, madam. Not to worry. I had to cut through the field to get here in time. Save your hands. I know. I know what you say. Save your hands. Harmony will be always with you, hmm? Be careful, take care. Come. Come, come. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. She will be all right. Okay. - Bye, Angel. - Bye. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. You do it. One, two, three. Good job, Leo. Maybe it is a waste of time, huh? - Uh, I mean my thesis. - Oh, okay. That's different. One, two, three. One, two, three. - Very good. Good job. - Good job, Leo. We're all done for today, okay? Here, let me just take this off. Thanks. Well, Max does know music if anything. If anything. - Easy, he's still my boyfriend. - Mm-hmm. Anyhow, if the same habitual response were to be combined with say strumming or beating a bongo, I just think that you would have an easier time with your patients. And that's exactly why your time isn't wasted here, Raina. I know, you are right, of course. It's just that Neurocon is in a few weeks, and even if I used your facility, I mean where am I going to get the patients to study? Hmm. Good point. Thank you. Raina, let me show you something, very quickly here. Hmm? Ah, this is Den. He is from India. - He was a patient of mine a long, long time ago. - Wow. Look, he is dancing. He is loving this music. He is so happy. You know there are tons of advocates for alternate therapies outside the U.S. In fact, I know someone, Dr. Sen. She and I were college roommates and now she is the director of the Hope Institute in Kolkata. - Kolkata. - Kolkata. - Mm-hmm. As prophetic as that sounds, there's no time for me to go to India. Raina, you can always reschedule your review cycle. Research worth doing is worth doing right. Okay, India. Max would freak. Yeah. Max, dinner's here. Were you going to get it? Well, I suppose I'm buying, too. Money is on the table. Really? Indian food? We need to talk. I'm getting pizza. I signed... signed up for music therapy. - And you should come, too. - Hmm. Please. Very funny, what next you want me to sign up for American Idol? American Idol, very funny. Doctor is coming from... America, for special research. Here's the address. The Hope Institute. - First time here, Madam? - Yes. It's beautiful. That was just the airport. Victoria Memorial, Park Street, Maidan, Beautiful colors. If you are tired of buildings, Madam, nightclubs, shopping, new market, AC Market. Sounds good. Thank you. - Good luck, Madam. - Thanks. - Dr. Sen, Raina Wilson. - Huh, please come. - Glad to meet you. - You, too. - Well, I will show you around. - Yeah. It's so wonderful to see a facility of this size focused on disabilities. We consider the Hope Institute a place of possibility not disability. That's my challenge also. - I'll show your apartment, come. - Okay. - Come. Hopefully you'll find it before too long. Well, we have several students signed up for you. - Thanks. - Get some rest, I will see you later. Okay. Thanks. Tanya, severe cerebral palsy. Adite, Down syndrome. Niladri, acute leukemia, severe migraines, paralysis of the spine. Jeeja, Misty, Palek, Brent, Miguel, Tanya, Adite, Niladri. Jeeja, Misty, Palek, Brent. - Good morning, everyone. - Good Morning. - My name is Raina. - Hi. - Hi. I am your new teacher from America. Can everyone say the name Raina? Raina. Very good, what is your name? - Shruti. - Shruti, that's a beautiful name. - What is your name? - Jeeja. Jeeja. Lovely name. - Now you guys are all lucky, you know why? - Why? Because, all of you only have to learn one name, Raina, but I have to learn all of your names to get to know you, right? Well, how am I going to do that? Well, they say you can learn a lot about someone by what kind of music they like. So, I'm going to play some songs, some different songs, and see what you guys respond to. - Come in. - She can't hear you. Come. - No fighting, no fighting, are you okay? - Hmm. - Okay? - Hmm. You want to sit down? Thank you. You are my new best friend. Come, come to the class. Yes, join, join. It was horrible and all I kept thinking was Max told me not to use nursery rhymes as music. Yeah, sounds like you could have destroyed some eardrums, Raina. Why don't you come back before someone actually gets hurt? Huh, it took me a day to get here. I couldn't even turnaround if I wanted to. Well, make it quick. I had to wash my gig clothes and I ruined my favorite vest. Babe, I told you that needed to be dry-cleaned. Well, I didn't know that. I don't do my own laundry, Raina. So you owe me big. I do? Listen, Max, I gotta get to sleep okay, so I... I'll call you soon? No, Raina. Hello? Unbelievable. - Hey, Claud. - Hi, Raina. Listen, so I just wanted to let you know, day one, disastrous. Hang on. I'm just going to get some tea, one sec. Wow! Yeah, may be give me someone else to talk to. Hey, don't forget to look up Den. I'm sure he'd love to help. Oh, Claud, I'm so sorry. I totally forgot. - I'll look up Den tomorrow, okay? - Okay. Bye, Claud. This is Den. Den, she is Raina Wilson from America. She is researching on music therapy at Hope Institute. Nice to meet you. I'm a colleague of Dr. Claudia. Oh. - Den is an avid music fan. - Yes. So I've heard. Maybe you can help me out. Sure. In his hospitality, Den showed me that in India, there is a musicality and rhythm, in everyday life. This is my therapy. Nature has music for those that listen. - I think you are the second best friend I've made in India. - Okay. The first better be amazing or I'll be offended. My first best friend. Yeah, I'm not offended. Okay, now that everyone's here, my friend Den here believes that you can find music in nature. So let's see what kind of sounds nature can make, okay? Yay! Let's hear the sound of the rain. Ready? Now, lighter rain. Stop, stop, stop. Okay. No. Oh, no! Guys, guys, guys. Sit down. Sit down. Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit. Relax, relax. - Come, come. - Oh, God! - You need more best friends now? - Yeah, I think so. Raina, listen to me. I insist that you come home as scheduled. This is my life uprooted, too. Oh, yes. What? What? Is someone there with you? What? No. You know you're the one who told me that if... I would fail without any concrete research, right? You think I'm here having an affair with an Indian guy in a wheelchair? I don't know Raina, put me on a video chat. Look, I'm going to calling you when I know my schedule, okay? Love you. ♪ Twinkle, twinkle Little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ Up above the world so high ♪ ♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ The happy boy Niladri made friends easily. He loved to write poems. I couldn't speak always, you know. When I was a kid, my parents sent me to a doctor, friend of Raina's in America. Priya was the first girl in my life who never thought I am different. Being with you has changed my life. Thanks for being my girlfriend. We? We could never be boyfriend and girlfriend. Huh. Den, Den. What happened? Den, Den, Den. Hi. Oh, that sounds wonderful. I thought I was in a festival for a minute. Why not have them put on a show? Mm-hmm, give them a goal. Uh, I've already bit off more than I can chew. Um, I can help. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Hmm, okay. I have another staff member helping me organize a small concert to keep the students interested in music, I just can't pinpoint that measurable goal to reach. Hey, how's Den? He's good. I mean there was some drama, but he's been a big help. Remember, it's not always the physicality of the condition that's most debilitating. It's the mental condition that is wrongly imposed. "It's the mental condition that is wrongly imposed", right? Have you done any sightseeing or anything? No. I can't... I don't... I don't have time. Don't tell me you don't have the time. You'll never gauge your progress if you don't get out for a fresh perspective. As your mentor, I insist. - Okay. Okay. Bye. - Bye. - "Thoughts... - Jeeja. ...the childhood days of sheer bliss..." What's wrong? - Niladri. - Sorry. You know when I first met him, he told me he felt very lucky because besides his mother, his two best friends were the most beautiful girls in the world. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Will I be able to pursue my dreams, my studies? - Yeah. The significant others both young and old, they cheer me up and cheering, "Yes, you can. Of course, you can." He is right about his luck. You two are his angels on Earth. You know that. And now he gets to be your angel. That's what friends are for, right? Good way to think of it. As I look into the vastness of the evening sky and watch the birds returning to their nests, I am once more lost in the realm of my thoughts. You know what? We could really use a diversion, so how about you be my travel partners? Niladri will always be remembered for his creations. His disability was brought on by acute Leukemia. Surprise. And for those who cannot articulate their emotional or physical pain, as a society, we need to bring other forms of communication into their lives. Open. Turn it on. Right. Oddly enough, text messaging is a big step towards realizing that we are all connected. This realization offered me the opportunity to help Angel who by being hearing impaired was my greatest challenge. - Thank you. - Welcome, my pleasure, my pleasure. Okay. Go slow. Go slow. Oh, oh. - Wait, wait. - Okay. Surely, we will stop by the temple on our way back. Absolutely. It could be hard going home, you know. Especially after you've been gone a long while. I feel like it's been months since I left America. Why did you come all the way to India? Simple. I needed a supportive environment to, uh, research what I believe is an important tool to the functioning of the human brain. Raina, wouldn't it be easier to research normal brains? Why not research normal brains? Well, that's the whole point, what makes a brain normal, right? What you feel or what's popular opinion? People here are more receptive to not worrying about popular opinion. Ego's everywhere, huh. The way I see it when people think that you're a freak and you've got nothing to lose, you can't fall off the floor, right? You can't fall off the floor? Okay. Right. Raina, what made you want to be a brain doctor? - What made me want to be a brain doctor? - Yeah. Hmm. Curiosity. When I found out that this... this little spongy thing up there that weighs less than a pound was responsible for everything, I guess I just wanted to know how. Aren't you curious about other body parts, - like the heart? - The heart? - Yes. Sure I'm interested in the heart, just not in a scientific way. Oh, my Anil. Oh, Angel. - Come, come. You must be Den. - Yeah. This is my friend Raina and Jeeja. - Nice to meet you. - Namaskar. - Thanks. - Come, come, come. - These rains can seep to your bones. - Thank you. Thank you. Please, have it. I have a question. My son. They were very close. I am lucky to have him as long as I did. Angel just didn't understand death. After that I enrolled her in the local school for special needs. Mm-hmm. - Where she met Dr. Sen. - Oh. Thank you. You are looking beautiful. Hello. I heard an Angel is here. Hmm. This is good. I can't. That's it. Thank you for your hospitality. I wish we had a doctor like you sooner. Oh, thank you. Who are we to say what the right time is, she is here now. Oh, so sweet. If you don't mind me asking, how did Angel's mother die? Complications during childbirth. Our people thought that when someone was born, - not right, they were cursed. - Hmm. That's why we named her Angel. Hmm. But, uh, her mother could not take the guilt and she felt responsible, so she ended her life. Thankfully we had another angel here to help. Oh, my goodness. Beautiful tea garden. Yeah, wow. Mrs. Borah, come here and dance. Music unites people of different backgrounds no matter what the socioeconomic setting is. - Just don't bother. - There's got to be a ramp. I doubt wheelchairs were invented during the time this was built. Please move on, I will join you later. - Yeah? - You sure? - Sure. Okay. You sure? Okay. See you. - Beautiful. - Out there is my temple. Seriously? After that trek? - Look at this. - Yeah. - What's your ideal world? - Ramp in every public place. - Yeah. - Roll a mile on my chair. Actually, I wish I could. I guess what I mean is, I wish everyone had the ability to put themselves in each other's position. - Think about it, Raina. - Yeah. If a bully could be made to feel his victim's pain. Right, if the physically fit could roll a mile in the seat of someone who couldn't walk then I think there'd be a lot more support. What is your ideal world? If nothing was in my way, I'd want to contribute to society. You do. Hmm. Yes, we don't need pity. - We can contribute to society... - Mm-hmm. - ...like anyone else. - I agree. It's all about respect and trust and how big and open your heart is even if you don't have anything to begin with, hmm. We are really very happy that you are here. Oh, thank you. Niladri's mother believes that his love of music extended his life. Oh, at least my neonatal studies proved useful. It would be best for all of us if you made progress. There is an expert in Indian classical raga and philosophy. You may like to meet her. - Yeah, I would love that. - Yes. Let us all be happy. Let us all be free from illness. Let all see the auspicious. Let us all be free from misery. You know, most of the people who lead a materialistic life often feel they are missing something and they look for a purpose in life. All problems in life arise from materialistic longings and desires. They are mostly psychological, but all solutions are spiritual. Um, I need to learn how music does things like that. You know what they say, admitting and realizing that you have a problem is the first step. Dr. Sen sent me. Okay. Shanti. come with me. Thank you. You know ragas are designed - to activate the chakras. - Mm-hmm. You can feel so happy that you want to dance... ...and sometimes it makes you so sad that you want to cry. You know, Raina, there is a note for every mood. - My fiancé is a musician. - Yeah? I remember him ranting about classical music being at a different frequency - than modern recordings... - Mm-hmm. ...and, um, in my neonatal work I witnessed the calming effect, so, you know. I have a story, I will tell you later. Okay. Come with me. Den, Den, what happened? My father died. Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. I need to be independent. I need a job. Okay. We'll get you a job. Okay? No worries. We are covered. - As far as I am concerned the job is yours and I'm just... - Raina. Okay, here we go. It's okay. Don't worry. Thanks. 6Yes. - Oh, you're Den. - Yes, that's me. I am Omar, the station manager. - Hi, I am Raina. - Raina, very nice to meet you. - I'm just here for luck. - Okay. Come on. Yeah. ♪ ...win ♪ ♪ Let me be brave Let me be strong ♪ ♪ Let me be wrong ♪ I was so happy that Den got the job. Beautiful. ♪ Let me be brave ♪ In many ways Den became my mentor, so it was important for me to help him anyway. Oh, nice. I love it. Nice. And what are all these charges on the Amex? They called about suspicious activity from a department store in Calcutta. That's where I am. Yes, but why are you shopping in the men's department? Max, it's late. Okay? I have a little work to do and... Put me on video chat. So today we are going to be listening to different genres of music to see which one you all respond to. The first one is gonna be country. What you think? Next, rock and roll. Good, Yes. Oh, God. Hi, Den, slow down. You are going to take my job. Go on. And now the soothing sounds of classical music. No sleeping. I see you. Don't fall sleep. Okay. Next, we are going to listen to someone that I know very well. My boyfriend from America has a heavy metal band, so let's see if you guys like this. Okay, okay. Everybody relax. Out, it's out. It's out. Okay. Relax. Everybody relax. The longer I stayed in India, the more I realized what a perfect place it was to study music therapy. Come, I will take you to that side. You know, - raga is not meant to be composed. - Mm-hmm. It's... it's sort of a generator, like the Deepak Raga when sung properly can create fire, but that doesn't matter, there is the Megh Mallar which brings the rain down to sooth the Earth. Their culture is known for keeping the body in harmony, and this mindfulness is made possible through rhythm, vibration, and music. Let's go that side. Is that the story you wanted to tell me? I knew a teacher who had a boy in her class, who did not like to study. - Never paid attention, never responded to her. - Mm-hmm. But one day she was humming a song and he liked it. - He asked her to sing along. - Right. - So she said that, yes, I will sing if you study... - Mm-hmm. ...and he gladly did so after that. What was the song? The song was based on Raga Bhairav, it stimulates the heart and it made him feel a sense of security, love, and fearlessness. It's... it's important to all of us - and it makes us all feel the same way. - Right. But it is more important for an autistic child. Hmm. I believe you. You know, the whole universe - is created by energy. - Mm-hmm. - Including colors and sounds. - Mm-hmm. It all connects us together, each one of us to the sound of Omkara. Omkara. Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find Den Roy? Mailroom. Uh, do you mean that wheelchair dude? - Yeah. - That side. - Okay. Thank you. - Welcome. Ma'am, please sign here. Mm. - Hey, Den. - Yeah. Who was that lady here? She is not your mother. Now just don't tell that she is your girl. Raina. Raina is just a friend of mine. - No nothing like that. - Okay, okay. ...Oh, Den, I have to scoot. ...Okay. - Okay, see you. - Bye. - Hey, Den. - Yeah. - You too come in. - Okay. - So you say her name is Raina, right? - Yes. - She is from America. - Okay. She is researching on the effect of music therapy in helping disabled people. Wow! That's great. Just one minute. Hey, Omar. Can you just come in here? Spectacular, isn't it? Can you do combined trials with their academic work? Some may need more attention than others. Palek is already calmer. Great progress. Good evening, friends, welcome to Radio India. This is Renny and we have a special guest in our studio, Den Roy. And he is here to tell us about what a friend of his is up to over at the Hope Institute. Welcome, Den. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, students with a variety of developmental challenges are using music as a tool to facilitate their physical and academic goals. Den quickly moved out of the mailroom and on the air. Hmm, Den is doing a great job. Yeah, he is fantastic. Den inspired Angel and Jeeja to find work. I'm really happy to be associated with the foundation. Any help in social services. - You are welcome. - Happy. Hi, you are on air with Ren and Den, what's your question? I just wanted to say, I think it's great that people like you are taking time out for the disabled. Okay, Den will answer this. Thank you so much for calling. Actually, I am an individual with disabilities. I have been blessed with an opportunity to be the voice of the people. You, listeners, can't see, but Den here is confined to a wheelchair. Uh, Renny is right. What I have is similar to cerebral palsy but worse. For a long time in my life I couldn't speak a full sentence. Den, Den. Den was able to use his platform to help those who needed it even more than him. We all set out to deliver care packages in the slums. Oh, careful. Oh, I thought America had some bad places. This isn't safe for you two alone, okay? You are back with Den. By now you have those images of your loved ones in your mind. Can you imagine those women being attacked brutally on their way home? I am here to bring a voice to the woman of abuse everywhere. Who is that? Hello. Hello. Come. What we found was something even more horrifying than people in poverty. Come, come. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. We are here to help you. We are here to help you, okay? Yeah, here. Here you go. - What's your name? - Sofia. Okay, do you live with your parents? Here. - Oh, my God! - Come, come, come. Jeeja, Angel. It's only a matter of time. Go, go. Go away. I will be back. We have to get out of here, okay? I want to but they have my sister. I can't leave her. There has to be something that could be done. It's child prostitution, drugs, she has autism! These are the real slum dogs. The authorities are not at all trustworthy. One accusation to the wrong person, the institute loses its support. Then I'll go to the authorities. An American female, telling a bunch of corrupt people how to rule? - Yeah. - If you are not arrested or raped, you will be deported. Look, I understand. I am a woman, too, but I can't risk this institution. I am sorry, Raina. I promised Claudia I wouldn't let your personal drive affect your professional focus... and pretty soon, chaos. Are you speaking personally or professionally? Does it matter? We have to do something. Sofia? This is exactly what Den's show is about. No way, you can't. You can't. As the voice of the people, you have to help us help Sofia. - Help Sofia? - Hmm. Jeeja and you cannot get into the slum. It is too dangerous. You have to help me. It's a bad idea. No. Angel. Angel. Angel, please. Please. Angel. Angel. Stop, please. Stop. Angel. Angel. Thank you. They can come any time. I usually hide here and sleep. Okay. We need to make a plan. Record everything, okay? Yeah, Sofia will record everything so that we can get the attention of the people. - Okay? - Yes. Let's go. Let's go. Ready to rehearse? Hmm? Okay everyone, this is the last rehearsal before the concert, if anyone wants to practice their parts before then, Hiya is available. Okay, ready? Where is the rest? That's all. That's all I could get for it. You lie and steal from me. Your sister will wait for you to make up the difference for your mistake. Yes, boss. Let them rape. Very good. Yes. I thought I was the only one who could not sleep. I can't rest wondering what is happening to her. We should have never put Sofia up to take risk all by herself. Mm-hmm. Hmm. I didn't receive any messages either. - It's locked. - Hmm. - I'm really getting worried. - No worries, no worries. I'll find them. Stop, stop, stop. Where are you going, Ma'am? I need to get into the slum area. The road is blocked. The slum is not a tourist attraction. I'm searching for two, uh, girls, like this big, uh Indian... - Long hair, pretty? - Yes. You've just described every lost girl. You're not allowed to proceed further. I'm too late. My sister is not here. Come, come. Let's go. Come. Give it to the media and make it public. Sure. I should have given you girls more credit, if something had happened to you, I wouldn't have forgiven myself. Thank you. - Namaste, Babaji. - Namaste. - You are leaving too soon. - Not yet. You can't run forever. I'm not running. It's just my way of calming down when things get crazy. Hmm, remember, what does a monkey know of the taste of ginger? If I meet one, I'll ask him. Den here, has the voice of the people. Today, I am bringing to you the story, of life in slums. Some brave young ladies are really hoping that you are going to do something about this. But, first, I would like to tell you a little bit about them. Angel's biggest dream at one time was to help her mother in housekeeping, she cannot hear and cannot speak. The difference she wants to make speaks volume. Also with me are her friends, Jeeja and Sophia. Ah, the concert's tomorrow. Everyone has come so far. I swear, I mean even you would be impressed. Anyway, you know, I guess I'll see you soon. Don't rush home on my account. Heh. No, I'm looking forward to presenting my findings. So was it a waste of time? Hmm. Namaskar. I welcome you all to this lovely evening. I would like to invite Raina Wilson to the stage. Good evening, everyone. I am thrilled to present to you this extraordinary event this evening. Tonight, as she mentioned, is the result of a lot of hard work and dedication and I couldn't be prouder. When I first came to India I didn't know what to expect, but I was certainly up for the challenge. And these students here tonight are not people with disabilities. They are children with magical abilities. We give you now, the children of Hope Institute. Here is my report. Don't you want to review it with me? I have seen the results. Thank you. In a short time you have documented that learning music can improve attention, concentration, impulse control, self-esteem, self-expression, - and many more things that we may not have noticed yet. - Hmm. Yes, you have proven that there is much more work to be done. - I am eternally grateful to you. - Hmm. Raina, you know your presentation is set for next Tuesday. - I'll see you soon. - Okay, bye. Someone who cannot understand cannot appreciate. People are disabled more by society than they are their own bodies. Considering the numbers and our ever-increasing lifespan, disability is a human rights issue that will eventually affect all of us. Thank you. Okay, I'm happy to answer any questions. Go ahead. How does music effect the human brain? Well, we know that music stimulates the entire brain, right? Neuroplasticity is a way to help the brain to reorganize itself and in some cases bypass areas of injury and affect the development of skills in other areas. So this is why we see therapists using singing to teach patients with severe brain injuries how to speak again. Okay, in the back. So what happened to Den and Angel? These two certainly consumed and changed your life. They changed lives even of people they never met. The day I was supposed to leave India, I went to the airport but my flight got cancelled. Truth be told, I was looking for a reason to stay. Wait here, wait here. I knew when I saw them behaving like a normal couple, emotionally in tune with each other, if I stayed, I would only serve as a reminder of their physical challenges and they didn't need any more of that in their daily lives. It was time for them and me to live normally. ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ One little hope ♪ ♪ Like a dream You and me ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ In a story That was meant to be ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ Let them live Let them grow ♪ ♪ Give them love Heart and soul ♪ ♪ And one little finger ♪ ♪ It's who we are It's where we stand ♪ ♪ And how we rise up Hand in hand ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ We're not afraid We're not alone ♪ ♪ And what we're doing Is going to make us strong ♪ ♪ We can change our world And do it altogether ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ So full of love ♪ ♪ For everything That's you and me ♪ ♪ Never hurtful Never hateful ♪ ♪ Love is openness And love is understanding ♪ ♪ Absolutely as it should be ♪ ♪ Love can change the heart Of any human being ♪ ♪ Ever joyful, ever grateful Life is beautiful ♪ ♪ And always Got you living positively ♪ ♪ All this can be ♪ ♪ We can make the best Of any situation ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ Let them live Let them grow ♪ ♪ Give them love Heart and soul ♪ ♪ And one little finger ♪ ♪ It's who we are It's where we stand ♪ ♪ And how we rise up Hand in hand ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ We're not afraid We're not alone ♪ ♪ And what we're doing Is going to make us strong ♪ ♪ We can change the world And do it altogether ♪ ♪ One little dream ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ Let them live Let them grow ♪ ♪ Give them love Give them heart and soul ♪ ♪ And we can change the world And do it altogether ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ One little hope ♪ ♪ Like a dream You and me ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ In a story That was meant to be ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ One little finger ♪ ♪ Every time I look Inside of me ♪ ♪ I'm so proud of ♪ ♪ Of what I see today ♪ ♪ Because we've come ♪ ♪ Yes We've come a long, long way ♪ ♪ Anything I want I'm gonna try ♪ ♪ When I dream my ♪ ♪ My dreams are high and brave ♪ ♪ I'm just too scared ♪ ♪ I'm too scared to be brave ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know I can ♪ ♪ Yes, I know I can ♪ ♪ But the best that I can be ♪ ♪ When you're standing Next to me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know I can ♪ ♪ Yes, I know I can ♪ ♪ But the best that I can be ♪ ♪ When you're standing Next to me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ I can ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know I can ♪ ♪ Yes, I know I can ♪ ♪ I'm the best that I can be ♪ ♪ When you're standing Next to me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ I can ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, you, oh, yes, you ♪ ♪ Yes, I can ♪
