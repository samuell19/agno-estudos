Detroit Police? There has been a theft in the museum. Chief, we've got Marcellus. Yo, let's go! Why are you such a stick in the mud? It's not just my scene, that's all. Why do you even want to hang out with me? You enjoy your Detroit friends so much better. They don't matter like you do. - Even your mother was... - My mother? You gotta be kidding me. What the hell, man? Would you please stop? I can take care of myself. What is that? Stick in the mud. What was that? Did you hear that? Hey, come on out, you piece of shit. Rachelle, run! Mornin', Billie. Hell of a way to start a mornin'. Check in with Lieutenant Rossman. He'll get your assignment at the crime scene, okay? What's with him? He's not a suspect. We already cleared him. But he's an asshole. I know. Well, looky who it is. I ain't doin' a thing wrong, officer. What you want, huh? You want to come look at my little girl's grave? And how many times you been here since you got her killed? Oh, you got Brie all worked up about serving her country, left her poor mother at home to suffer. And now they're both fuckin' dead. Put the beer away, Cal. Go home. Finnick. You're up. Major. Torch, this is Paladin. Paladin, this is Torch. We have the package. No! No! Let's go! I order you to breathe. Look, you cannot die. You cannot die. I need you here. I need you. I mean, your dad and, you know, Ellis. No, no, no. No, you breathe, dammit. Brie! Brie. Brie, no, look at me, look at me. Brie. Detectives, what've we got? We got Raj Dalal, 36 years old, Rachelle Winston's boyfriend, the girl whose body we found in the cemetery. Oh. Is he her killer? I don't know, Chief, but, uh, he's definitely hiding somethin'. I mean, wow. We got a call for a B and E, over at Cherrywood Estates. When we arrived on the location, we found Raj over here hiding in a woodshed. You think because maybe he whacked his girlfriend? Show him the piece, man. Found this little pea-shooter here. Didn't even take a single shot. You think he did it, Chief? No. Look at this guy. He's terrified in there. He's about to piss himself. Definitely. I'm Detective O'Connor. This is Detective Alayoubi. We're with the Lake Orion PD. We'd like to ask you a series of questions. Can you please state your name and age for the record? Raj Dalal, 36. Raj, do you know why you're here? No. Can you tell me about Rachelle Winston? You were her boyfriend, right? We just hung out a couple of times. Let's take this step by step. Where were you, last night? You guys wouldn't believe me. Try us. We're the good guys. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. English, please. I saw a devil, last night. We were just hanging out by, by the Oakwood Cemetery, and this creature, man, just came out of nowhere with glowing eyes, a tail, screams like a banshee. It killed her, man. They call it Nain Rouge. It killed her, man. It killed her. Whoa, whoa, whoa, so you're telling me you saw a creature with glowing eyes and a tail? That's what you're telling me? Yes. You believe this fuckin' guy, partner? Did you kill Rachelle Winston? No, I didn't kill, I didn't kill her. Nain Rouge killed her. Trust me. Trust you? I need a lawyer. That's the smartest thing you said all day, today. Thanks for wasting our time. Get the fuck out. I didn't want her to go back down there. I tried to keep her here. I knew she was running with a bad crowd, a real bad crowd. Had she been living in the city long? I, I think so. We haven't talked much in the past few months, not like we used to. She only comes around when she wants money. I just, I just couldn't talk to her anymore. But the last time that she came, I felt like I, I had to make her stay. But she wouldn't listen. That was a week ago. And now she's gone. My little girl is gone. We'll find who did this, Wendy. We'll find him. Don't tell me this is some contract hit, Chief. Billie Jean, you find me some witnesses, and I'll hear your case about some serial killer hiding up in the area. Until then, this is an inside hit. I'm sure of it, just like the one before. You heard Wendy. That girl was running around with a powerful city gang. Yeah, well, troubled kids in small towns do, sir. And I'm telling you, there's something bigger going on here. I feel it. Are you okay? It's a monster. It's here. It's living in the woods beyond my property. I saw it. Anna Lee, I am not the person to be acting like this in front of, all right? Come with me now. I'm gonna take you home, okay? I'm really not gonna be that man, I'm just sayin'. Finnick, what's up, sexy? Oh, shit. You're gonna get throat punched. And you're mean. Sit the fuck down. - Don't tell me to sit down. - Sit, troll. I'm sorry, Mom, Dad. Why, why? I'm not two. Anyway. Finnick, I got the Winston case files. What do you think? You think it's a gang or something bigger? Something bigger? What could be bigger? All the stuff we've been through, we've seen some shit. Yeah, but that was war. Okay, that wasn't here. At least in war, you know who your enemy is and why. And you don't think that can happen here? Desperate times, desperate measures? Have you ever heard of the Nain Rouge? Yeah, I think we have. I mean, we have a witness back there that I fucking just beamed his head off the damn table, talkin' about a little red devil, pointy ears, long tail, yeah. He's full of shit. What, you believe it? I don't believe any of it. You don't believe it? No. I mean, I'm not saying I believe it. But there's a lot of coincidence and a lot of talk around town about it. That doesn't mean I believe in demons and monsters. We need to get to the bottom of this, okay? I believe we need to figure it out. We're on it. Get to work, ladies. She's fuckin' high. Officer, officer! Officer, you need to get over there. This motherfucker killed somebody. - You guys called this in? - Yeah, we called it in. - All right. - There's a motherfucker and dragged the body back there. - Calm down. - There's blood everywhere. Calm down, tell me what you saw. A man just dragged his body back there. There's blood in the back of the chapel. There's freakin' blood everywhere. It looked like Hannibal Lecter and some shit. Okay, where? He just dragged him inside. - It's everywhere. - Look, I'm from Detroit, and I ain't never seen shit like that. - Where? - In the back of the chapel. Stay right here. Freeze! Shit. Radio 502. I've got an active homicide at this location. Back-up units, right now. Oh my gosh, Billie, you okay? Yeah, I'm good. You had shots fired there. Yeah, three of 'em. And I know I hit him. Chief, it's been years since the last homicide. I've never seen anything this brutal, not even in combat. Hey, DJ Godfather, what's up, man? Hey, what up, man? Have you seen this guy? Yeah, he's a regular. Corner booth, right over there. I fuckin' knew it. Come on, let's go. When's the last time you played with pyrotechnics? You know, I was really starting to get to know her. Really don't give a shit. She's an art history major. What do you know about a crackhead named Ike? I think both of you are way out of your jurisdiction. Can you believe this fuckin' guy? Don't worry, Marcellus, we already filled out our deconfliction report. I'm not gonna have the answers for the questions you're gonna ask. Neither of you have any idea who or what you are fucking with. I don't give a shit about your daddy. You understand that? Look at me, I don't give a shit. It's got nothing to do with him. What are you gonna do, tell us a story about a little red devil? - What the... - Whoa, whoa! Don't be stupid, don't be stupid. - Who told you? - Walk away. - Hey, Billie. - Hey. - Hey, Billie. - Hey. You called, Chief? Hey, Billie, come on in and have a seat. Give you one guess where our victim's from. 25-year-old male, low-level hood rat, runs around with a group called, you ready for it? The Corpses, kinda fitting now, isn't it? This is guy is a wanted felon, wanted for weapons and firearms violations. He's got a criminal history you could wallpaper your bathroom with. What do we say about these guys around town, Billie? Play stupid games... Win stupid prizes. What the hell is he doing out here? No clue, but this much I know, whatever he was doin', he's not doin' it no more. Probably a contract hit, inter-gang violence, but somebody wanted him removed. Is the city gonna get involved? No, the city doesn't give two shits about a guy like this. He runs out of their city and comes to ours and gets murdered, the only thing they care about, he's off their radar. The mutilated that man. There's no way that was some ordinary hit. It wasn't an ordinary hit, Billie. He was mutilated. But the one thing you have to remember, your focus, your attention is that we have our own people, and with that, our own problems. Are we done? We are, just read the case and know the file. Yes, Chief. Please accept these special shell-casings as a reminder of this shot volley in honor of your daughter's commitment to our freedom, by entering the Armed Forces. If you have any questions, the court phone number's on the bottom. Have a better day. Radio 502, cleared traffic. Pastor Wilhem, how are you today? Officer Finnick, I'm good, thank you. As always, I feel the current temperament of the people of Lake Orion, but today, as in the past few days, we're very concerned and especially frustrated. Is there anything I can say to the congregation, any news at all, about this sordid mess, the accident that took several lives, even of someone not so innocent? Well, you know, we share in your frustration, Pastor. This definitely wasn't an accident. It's been ruled a homicide. And we are currently pursuing all leads for suspects. Aside from the low-income crime which we deal with here, the last thing our youth needs is the immeasurable negative impact of the gang activity and the drug abuse and the prostitution which runs rampant in that horrible place. Mulder. Mulder. Major? Now that's a voice I haven't heard from, in a long time. What can I do for you, Finnick? I've got big trouble in a small town, sir. Thank you, officers. Please follow me right this way to the crime scene. This is our Native American exhibit, where the crime was initiated. Will you follow me to the concourse? Sure. You know, Dr. Sudhir is curator, of course, and, um, he knows a lot about this situation, and he could probably explain it better than I. I keep an eye on our city's most important artifacts. But something's slipped through the cracks, from what I understand. Oh, yes, a most unfortunate crime. It was done close to around midnight, well planned. Nightingale, what does this have to do with Lake Orion? It's fear, officer, fear of pain, fear of death, fear of the unknown, were you to have this here knife, and others saw possibilities. I'm not following. The knife is a weapon that was forged in fire and blood, by the Native Americans, South Michigan. Chief Pontiac himself carved the knife from the bone of the wolf that was killed by a French soldier. The knife in question was a weapon of the Ottawa Indian tribe who prospered like thousands of years ago, in and around the area we're standing on, today. Now the knife is said to endow the one who holds it with a protector, a ruthless guardian angel. And it would give them warning, share the land and take only what you need and do not destroy to live, or else. Unfortunately for those French settlers, our great city, they did not heed the words of what they called the Nain Rouge, and Detroit has suffered for it, ever since. If you are holding the knife, it may even come for you. But if you are not the one who summoned it, it will kill you. So be warned. You may only have this one chance to stop it. The book suggests that one has to strike the knife in the back of its neck, to banish it. It makes sense. You know, a couple of months ago, there was a murder, particularly gruesome murder, top-tier gangster. He hadn't been shot, stabbed, tortured, nothing like that. He'd been torn to shreds, Finnick. I mean torn to shreds. Man, after that, every other day, four or five times a week, same thing. That knife was used to summon a demon. Who would summon this thing? Why? Who knows? I mean, payback, somebody wants to get even, right a wrong, I don't know, but what I do know is this thing has gotten out of hand, and we have to find that knife. Hello. Who is this? Wait, wait, wait, hold on, calm down. Calm down, look, lower your voice, lower your voice. Where the fuck are you? I had this, this gorgeous, this, this, this beautiful turkey sandwich with all the trimmings. I'm talkin' about lettuce, tomatoes, yellow peppers, a little hint of salt and pepper, mayo. And this wasn't some supermarket, thin-cut slice of processed bullshit. This that thick-cut turkey, the kind they get me from Canada. Talk about a trade deal. So what do I do? I wrap it up, and I put it in the refrigerator. But you know that shit's not gonna hold, right? I wouldn't have called you out here - if it wasn't serious. - Lettuce gonna get all moist. Bread's gonna soak up part of the mayo. I don't take it with me, 'cause I don't wanna risk spilling it on my $3,000 suit, but when my son calls, I drop everything, don't I? Listen, some serious shit is gonna go down... Don't say another goddamned word. I only got less than one week before I put all my ducks in a row, and you're just a duck waitin' to quack. What, you think I'm gonna go out there and start tellin' everybody about what we do? - You fuck up... - I'm gonna sacrifice... And you fuck up, and you fuck up, and I handle it, don't I? You were supposed to be right by my side, standing right next to me, father and son. I mean, hell, we could've been. - But here we are, right? - It's another lifetime. Time and time, again. This time, it's different. Oh, it is? Listen, some heavy shit is about to happen in your jurisdiction. I need your help. Let me tell you something. Me meetin' you here, in this town, in this place, I mean, wow, you must've really fucked up royally. I came here to meet you face to face, to tell you one more time, that you not gettin' no more favors from dear, old Dad, nothing, nada. We're done. That's what you drove all the way here for? I'm gonna be watchin' you. And if you ever dare to speak about what I've done for you, boy, oh, boy, it's gonna be crucial. Welcome back to channel eight, "Talk Detroit." I'm Jay Towers. Here with us now is Sheriff John Wayne. Sheriff, thanks for being here today. Jay, thanks for having me. Recently, reports of a number of gruesome murders in the Lake Orion area have left many residents worried about their safety. Over the past few months, police have been tracking two men on charges of kidnapping and armed robbery. Both of the suspects were recently found dead in what some Lake Orion residents are seeing as a form of street justice. Now where did this all start? Well, we have a few open cases from Detroit, going back a few months, and we've linked that to this unknown assailant. So is it safe for us to assume that this is the work of an individual and not a group of people? Well, we're seeing a similar pattern, an M.O., if you will, and details have emerged that link this all together. Our investigation has kinda led us down the path to believe we're looking at a single suspect. You know, there was another gruesome death, last week, in Old Town. The victim was part of a group called The Corpses. Have you heard of them? Oh, yeah, we're familiar with them. Any connection there? Perhaps, it would seem to fit the pattern, but at this point, I would say nothing's been confirmed. Some residents are hypothesizing... Staff Sergeant Finnick. Trade in uniforms, huh? Well, I failed at the last one, so maybe I can right my wrongs, this time. Please stop. Why do you do that to yourself? You know you had nothing to do with Brie's death. I had everything to do with it. Look, you got to stop blaming yourself. You need to move past it. You cannot harbor the resentment. I was her NCO. I was supposed to protect her, and I, I didn't. I don't care about labels, okay. I don't care what your name is in the Army. You guys have been inseparable since you were little kids. We grew up together. You guys went over there fighting for the same thing. Blood everywhere, totally killed my buzz. It was crazy, man. Can you believe this shit? Yeah, he was hanging upside down, like a bat in an alleyway. You gotta do something. You gotta hide your wives and hide your kids. You know, the Nain Rouge is gonna get you. Some residents are hypothesizing that something animal or inhuman was responsible for these deaths. I mean, is there anything to that? You know, given the injuries to these victims, I understand how people are jumping to those conclusions, and we're not ruling anything out. But I would say, definitively, we're not looking for some kind of creature of folklore. You know anything about it? No. No, if I see something, I'll say something. You'll be the first to know. What about you? Not a damn thing. Nothin' makes sense. Yeah, apparently. I saw your dad, today. I guess that's why you haven't been around yet, huh? Where at? Just while I was out. I love my father, but he can be a real piece of shit, sometimes. And I'm sorry for that. He loved me like you guys, you and Brie. Come on, Penny. Come on, come on. Watch your step. Welcome to the Palace of Solitude. Wow, this looks totally different. Well, you know, my dad's not around that much anymore. Made it my own. But it's a living. They're beautiful. What happened? You were never this forthcoming when we were kids. Well, it took me a while, gettin' comfortable with being an artist, you know. I mean, the whole time I was in the city, it was tough. It's not a place to get your head straight. And then my mom died, and I was at the point where I couldn't see any end, no tomorrow. I, uh, kinda got lost in drugs, got really violent. I almost didn't make it out alive. Wow, this is all such a surprise to me. Yeah. Yeah, coming back home was the only move I had. I'm still working on my dad, but with the pastor's help, we'll get there. Pastor Wilhem? Yeah, he's a lifesaver. Starsky and Hutch. What's up, Chief? Just the guys I'm lookin' for. How you doin'? Hey, we got a positive ID on that guy you were chasing through the woods, last night. Yeah, what the fuck happened, last night? Nothing good. It's a Marcellus De Vaux. He's a local shithead, you know. Did you just say Marcellus De Vaux? I been chasin' this piece of shit for the past couple of years. Well, now's our chance, but here's the thing. He's very well connected with Mayor Flynn. Chief, mayor or no mayor, I don't give a fuck who his daddy is. I get it, I get it, but this is a minefield. I need you guys to get his ass, but step easy and don't blow anything up, okay? Yes, sir. Come on, baby, oh. It's almost ready, baby. Hey, hey, Ike. It's me, Simon. Ike? Guess what day it is. It's Devil's Night. That's right. You look like the cat that ate the canary. What the fuck brings you here? Hi. Can I get you anything? Beer, cigarette? How 'bout your decorator's phone number? Ah, don't be a dick. No, but seriously, what brings you here? I need something small, packs a punch, something that goes bang. Well, I would offer up Candy over here, but she's all mine. You wanna help him out, babe? Right this way. I'll be right with you. You seen the newspapers? You seen the front pages? Five deaths in 24 hours. I don't give a fuck. Yeah, well, two of them were your own men. Listen, man, I don't know how the hell they do it down there in Pine Barrens, New Jersey, but here in Lake Orion, we gotta take care of our own. Is this what you wanted? Looks like it. Let me see if it's all here. Oh, it's all there. You know, Candy, you're worth a lot more than Ike has to offer. Ah, this, it's working for me right now. Well, just make sure that you remember, you got a long life ahead of you. Report in, sector five. Come here, guys. Chief Pender! Chief, what've you got, man? Looks like a meth lab. Meth lab, everybody, all right, 500 feet, everybody's evacuated. Everybody's out. And as you're pullin' them out, interview 'em. Let's find out who these guys are and what they're doing, all right? Sarge, thanks so much for comin'. - We could use the help. - Yeah, no problem. We got two guys on foot. We could sure use a guard. I'll get you one. Radio 30-03, - can I get a K9 out here? - All right, guys. Chief, what the hell happened? Meth lab explosion. That's all we know. Two guys on foot. These guys are gonna be evacuating the rest of the park. Sure could use some help gettin' that done. This book contains anything and everything you'll need to know about Nain Rouge. Detective, please, come on in. Mr. Mayor. This is Officer Finnick, Lake Orion Police. Pleasure to meet you. - Thank you, sir. - Assistin' us on this case. Thank you, thank you, thank you for seeing me. I know it's a tad bit unusual meetin' me without the chief present. Nothin' inappropriate, is it? Of course, it's only a personal matter. Well, I don't do favors. Relax, Nightingale. You're a good man. You're an honest cop. No need to prove anything to me. Besides, you don't even know what I wanted to meet with you about. This about your, um, godson Marcel, is it? What was it, vandalism at 14, B-and-E at 15, got caught with an unregistered weapon that same year, somethin' like that? All charges were dropped. You think you got all the answers, don't you, Nightingale? That's my job. That's what I do. And I try to know who I'm dealin' with. I'm a business man, from Jersey, American made from American goods. You see, I'm not some rich asshole with a sports team or some hometown gangster with a dozen hands in his pockets. Look, all this bullshit about the gangs, revenge wars, turf killings, whatever you want to call it, it has nothin' to do with my son. Look, your godson is involved in this case, and that's a fact. The boy is just runnin' scared, but he's no murderer. I have a possible murder suspect in the abandoned warehouse on Oak Street, asking for another unit. 10-4, 501. There's another unit available in the area of Oak Street, got your back, 501. 502, we're in the area. Two-man unit, we'll be there in a second. Freeze! This is Finnick. I need backup on the roof. - Calm down, everyone. - With all due respect, Madam Mayor, these people deserve answers. I promise you, your voices will be heard. We will hear from each and every one of you, I promise. No, she won't! The Nain Rouge will kill us all! There have been 17 mysterious deaths of local residents within the week, and our community is at a great loss. Our council has laid out a plan of action. If you would allow me, I'd like to introduce our chief of police, Chief Romano. And lastly, effective immediately, I have enacted a curfew, from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., that's effective for all residents. Okay. Madam Mayor, the people deserve a reprieve from all this chaos. This is bullshit! Folks, please. Hey, come on, folks! Folks, please. This isn't what you think. It's only in place to keep you safe and your families accounted for. At 8 p.m., the curfew happens. And we want you either in your home or well on your way. Everyone, now, everyone, please, please. We all need to do our part. If you're home, then our fine men and women uniform will know you are safe. Look at all of you. Who's that motherfucker? - Gathered under one roof. - The pastor. Hmm. Coming together at just the right time. We need each other. There are forces out there that will try and tear us apart. No. An unwavering belief in the Lord and in our police force is what we can count on to keep us strong, keep us united. As for the person or persons responsible, let's just pray that all lost souls find their way back to salvation. The Nain Rouge is real! I lost my niece to drug violence, and I want the police to do something about it! We all heard about this little red devil on the loose. Is there a monster loose in Lake Orion? People, people, please, please. We need to keep our heads about us. There isn't anything supernatural going on. We've all heard the stories. Campfire tales, that's all. I need you to trust us, all of us, that we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom. In fact, Officer Finnick, who do you have there with you? Oh, my apologies, Chief, and to the great people of Lake Orion. I'm Detective Nightingale from the Detroit Police Department. I'm here on a special assignment to assist in investigating these murders. If you'll have me! Well, that'll be just fine by me. And in fact, I think that just about does it. Please be safe, everyone, going home and respect the curfew tonight. God bless you all. - Hey. - Hi. What happened to you at the town hall meeting? You know I'm not a politics guy. I was looking for you, today. I took a trip outta town. If you're, uh, not on this thing all night, or you just want to take a break, you should stop by later. I, uh, think I could do that. Okay. See you then. Is that your man there? Not yet. The night's still young. Now what's good here? Cheeseburgers. You buying? Why not? It has been summoned. Hey, perfect timing, come here. Set your phone down. Put these on. Here, push your hair back first. I don't think you want me to touch this... I got it, I got it. Thing. What is this? I'm not really sure. I was hoping you could help me out. Okay. Kind of a work in progress. Is this your first time? - Yeah. - Okay. Grab on to here, don't press the red handle. Put your mask down. I'm gonna guide you, okay? Okay. And... Now go in straight. How'd I do? Not bad at all. I'm impressed. Good afternoon, Doc. I'm Detective Nightingale from Detroit Police. Dr. Muskoviti. Pleasure to meet you, Detective. What's our story here? Got a real unusual case here. He's got a combination of real deep thermal and chemical burns, some real unusual wounds here. Either he learns how to shave less aggressively and not sit under the sunlamp all day, or as he claims, some red, little, rodent-looking monster broke into his house and blew up his meth lab and left him lookin' like this. Who did this to you, Ike? Get me out of here! Get me out of here! No, I need to get out of here! He's comin' for us all! Every single one of you motherfuckers is gonna die! He'll cut your tongue out before you even get a fuckin' word out! Let go of me, man! I need to get out of here! Let me go! - I got this. - Let me go! Ike, I got this! Ah! Ah! The ice cream social is next Sunday after services. Please stick around. I was reading a poem last week that I found in college, and it means more to me now than it did then, and I think it will for you, too. From "Ulysses," by Lord Alfred Tennyson. - Please. - I got this. Just tell me who did it. Who was it? The devil. It was the devil. Calm down, Ike. - Please. - Calm down. Leave the drugs alone, man. I told you that your whole life. Now get off of that shit, boy. I told you about that shit. - Please. - No, man, let go of me, man! Come on, man, it's gonna be all right. Ike, hold on, just hold on, man. This'll be fine. I got this. I'll be right back. Just hold tight. Much abides. Though we are not now that strength, which in old days, moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are. One equal temper of heroic hearts made weak my time and fate, but strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I gotta go. Okay. Duty calls. I'll see you soon? Yeah, yeah. You are good. Great. What more do I gotta say? You don't come around here, you hear me? This is my place as much as it is the boy's. But that don't mean just anyone's invited. Are you listenin' to me? In or out of uniform, you don't touch an officer of the law, ever! You also don't get to tell me who I can see. From now on, when we meet, you either smile, nod or wave. I don't care which. Then you go about your business. Don't say a single word. And if I ever catch you smelling like this again in a vehicle, I'll run your ass in. Now I loved your daughter. If I could've traded places with her, I would have. And I like your son. That's just the way it is. But none of that changes anything. It's best you get used to it. You deserve some credit. It was all your idea, after all. You've spoken of Nain Rouge for , well, as long as I can remember. But we took action. How can I possibly explain? Trying times demand drastic measures. You're a naive son of a bitch. It's too dangerous. You don't have the slightest idea of what you're doing. The congregation, the people of Lake Orion want this. Lasting peace and prosperity. Bullshit! We'll all burn for this. No, you're wrong. I know the word of the Lord. I've heard it. He speaks to me. Now put the gun away and just accept that this is a blessing from God. You made a deal with the devil, Pastor. Anna Lee, you put that gun down, right now. Do as he says. The people won't stand for it. Now, Anna Lee. This is your last warning. She's not gonna shoot. Our secret is safe with her. Please, Anna Lee. Let's hope God forgives both of you. Billie, it's Romano. What? Yes, I'll be there, in a second. Dad! Dad! Oh my God. Here, sit down. Jesus Christ. Neither of you move, all right? Come on. There's a monster. He's on his way here. And, Ellis, you're gonna help me kill it. Help you kill what? It's like a, like a red, some sort of a just... Listen, I don't care what the fuck this is about! I need to get him to a hospital now! Dad? Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, no, no, no, no, no, no. Dad, will you talk to me, please? - You hear me? - Okay. We can figure this thing out, and then you're gonna help me kill it when it gets here. And we'll get him to a hospital. We'll get him to a hospital. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Yeah, I fuckin' hear you! It doesn't matter now. Ellis, where are you going? Don't you get any bright ideas. I used up all my bright ideas! You know what this is? A knife? That monster you were talking about, that was me! I summoned it to kill people like you. Do you know how many people you've killed? That's not gonna bring my mom back, my sister back, and now my dad! But it'll fuckin' kill you! Call it off, Ellis! Ellis! Freeze. Turn around. I'm gonna need the knife. Not gonna happen. It doesn't matter. This is your end. No. Shoot me if you have to. You're gonna die here for that, Ellis. And no magic's gonna save you. Had you been really so righteous, it would've been you out there, stickin' his neck out, instead of hangin' this on every member of this town. Well, we're gonna change all that, aren't we? Get up, girl. Billie, this motherfucker's been here. Billie Jean! No. No, help! Finnick! Finnick! You motherfucker! Get your motherfuckin' ass out of here. What the fuck is wrong with you? Drop her, man, now! Nain Rouge! Come here! Get over here. Billie, no! No, you ruined it! Give me that. Back up! Get up! Get up. It's no good, Ellis. I was doin' good for this town. Hey, asshole, drop it or die! LOPD ain't gonna let you walk out of this motherfucker with one of their own. Give it up, Ellis! On your knees, hands on your head now! I was trying to help. How you feel? I don't know. What about your boy? We lost all the monster evidence, burned up the museum's artifact. Dammit. I don't know. Maybe we should just keep him a couple days, just for being an asshole. We should've blamed all this shit on his ass. Guess it's better than nothing. Thank you. Thank you. You gonna be all right in this town. Everybody's not made for the long war. You'll do just fine, Finnick. Take care of yourself. You too. Fellas, could I get a ride outta here? I'm looking for a fighter that goes by the name of Marcellus De Vaux. You mean J.D., the Jersey Devil. He's right there, honey. See, old friend, I broke more soldiers than you did.
