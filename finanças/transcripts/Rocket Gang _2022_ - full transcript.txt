Hi! Hello! 1.. 2.. 3.. Sound check. 1..2..3.. Hi, can you hear me? The graphic is added, so that everybody can settle down. And you won't miss the film. Did you buy popcorn and cold drink and everything? Please, turn the phone on silent mode. And please don't talk. You can do that at home. You've paid for the ticket, then why don't you watch the movie. Because if you will talk again, you will miss the story and ask someone to know the story. For that you will have to talk again. Everyone will be disturbed and it will spoil the fun. Okay, then the graphic is over. And the movie begins. You will know about me in the end. For now, it's time for introductions. Bunnu... Bunnu... - You scared him. - Come join us. Don't be such a chicken heart. Guys, selfie time. Look at this our sleeping beauty. Baby, come here. Let's take a selfie. Hey love birds! Smile! - Okay, baby. - Good. 'If I tell you what future has in stored from them...' 'You wouldn't believe me.' 'Let me show you instead.' Sahib! Don't just spend your whole day on an Apple. Eat an apple too sometimes. 'This Cyber-nerd is the IT Head of a renowned company.' 'He is a Punjabi by birth, but never behaves like one.' 'Neither does he drink nor does he dance. ' 'He's a stigma in the name of Punjabi.' What are you doing, Sahni? What are you doing, Sahni? Punjabi's always help each other out, bro. True. But you two always bully this - Punjabi brother of yours. - We won't anymore. - This is you, right? - Let it go. How can I let it go? Come on, get to work. 'This glowing face belongs to Tania.' 'Isn't she beautiful?' Sorry, I was distracted. 'She's a yoga instructor.' 'And she believes Yoga will do it.' 'What? Even she doesn't know that.' 'Her family is weirdo.' 'They love her and get on her nerves.' - Hi, Tania. - Hi! - Great session. - Thank you. - I have good news for you. - Yeah? The International Yoga Convention is happening in Delhi next month, and I want you to lead it. One second. Done with the class? Yes, Mom. Had breakfast? Already had breakfast and will have lunch on time as well. Hey sis, I'm meeting my friends for coffee. Can I wear your denim jacket? - Yes, you can. - Give it to me. - Tannu, please come home on time. - Okay, bye. We are planning to go out for a movie tonight. Of course, Papa. Bye, kiddo. 'This girl with a beautiful smile has no idea' 'that her peace of mind will once again get disturbed tonight.' - I want to attend the event. - Okay ma'am. Make it quick. I want this look. - Quick. - Sure ma'am. Pia. 'Meet Piya Dsousa. Handling rude women is her specialty.' 'She thinks she's an artist.' 'Like Picasso.' 'And why not?' 'It's an art to make grumpy people smile.' 'But that doesn't mean Pia leads a trouble free life.' 'Remember how Betal stalked Vikram in the famous folklore?' 'She too has a Betal in her life.' 'That's Pia's stalker.' 'He's stuck to her life just like chewing gum.' 'He stopped following her after she filed a police complaint.' Now no matter wherever I go, he is already there. So, it instead looks like I am following him. God! Gross. 'That's Binoy.' 'Everyone call him Bunnu.' 'He is so scared of his grouchy boss, ' 'that he spends day thinking' 'of the ways to avoid his boss's rebuke.' 'But even his boss is very stubborn.' Hey, sir! What are you doing here? Waiting for someone? Let me help you. Sir, it looks like no one enters the storeroom these days. I have been cleaning it since one hour. It was a mess. Looks like no one goes there. By the way, why are you late today? Come with me. Hurry up. Varun, the pink one goes there. Right. - Yes, sir? - What is this? Shirts? A maroon shirt placed in a pile of blue shirts? - Sir, Maroon has kept Varun here. - What? I mean, Varun must have kept Maroon here. Put them in their right place in two minute. I'll be back. Bloody mess. - Sir? - Yes, you. I wanted to ask you a question. Ask away. Where can I find coriander? Where can I find coriander? Hello. Where can I find coriander? Hello. 'Meet our Hero, Amarbir.' 'Misunderstanding is part of his life.' 'His choice of profession is also weird.' 'He keeps dreaming.' 'At the moment, his life and his dreams are stuck - in his father's store.' - What? Am asking, where can I find coriander? - Coriander? - Madam. - You will find coriander in this aisle. - Yes, this way. And.. Dry fenugreek? For dry fenugreek leaves you just need to go straight then take a... hmm. - Left! - No. Right! - Okay. - He's right. - Damn it. - Son. Who will man the 'Galla' (till) if you'll spend your time dreaming? Galla? Dad! For the last time, It's not Galla, Dad. It is... Dad, it is cash counter. Why are you dressed like you are going to a fair? A fair? Who goes to a fair these days, Dad? This is my swag. You never know when a producer/director will see and offer me a role? - I gotta be ready. - There he goes again. And the day I receive my first award... Today, I would like to thank my father. Mr. Karanbir Bajwa. Whatever I have become today, is only because of him. Oh thank you, thank you. How can you even ask your talented son to sell groceries? No! Not gonna happen. And you'll realize my worth when you see my posters everywhere! Give it to me, Dad. Give it. We'll see that when your posters actually become a reality. For now, put these Chyawanprash's posters all across the store. Okay? Chyawanprash, ew! No! - Dad! Dad, please. - Drama queen! Dad, no Chyawanprash. How about posters of avocado, olive oil instead? They at least have a good ring to it. Next you'll want to put up posters of Sanda Oil. This is not fair. Dad! Don't forget that the store's named after me. I am putting my foot down. Go man the cash counter. Dad! Hi guys, I am finally home. When are we going out for the movie? All she wants to do is watch movies! I already had two kids when I was of your age. You still make your mother pack lunch for you. What!! When are you going to get married? Come on, sis, how will I get married if you don't? Do you always want to see me in a jacket and not a wedding dress? Tania, I have shortlisted five boys for you. You have to select one. Marriage... is the biggest investment you make in your life. And we take care of this investment. A few good alliances are released into the market every year. And the job of getting the best, most profitable alliances to the right client is done by Tiwari Alliances. Bloody Tiwari! What does he think of himself? He is a virus! He corrupts everyone's mind whenever he comes here. After that, for a month, my family won't talk about anything other than my marriage. - Tania! - If he is so good at his job, then why is he still single? But Tania, my child... Ruining other people's life while choosing a carefree life for himself. Why don't you understand! He doesn't form relationships, he breaks them! And you guys fall for it every single time. Calm down. Breathe in. 'That's all for the intro. Let's begin with the story now.' 'Because they will soon see a twist in their lives.' 'And the twist in their life will turn their world upside-down.' 'And you know what happens when the rocket is launched.' Chai and ice cream? Black tea? You better decide, Bunnu. I just got noodles. What? Green chutney? Vada Pav, at this hour? I don't think I'll be able to get Vada Pav at this hour. Okay? Okay. Yes, I am coming. How did that fall? Idiot. Hello! You scared me! The store is closed. Anthony Inasu Kuriakose. We don't sell any of these three things. That's my name. - Like Neil Nitin Mukesh? - Yes. You can call me Tony. Okay Tony, what do you want? I wanted to put up a poster, sir. Of Sanda Oil? No! Out! Not Sanda Oil, sir. A resort's poster. One minute, sir. - Wonder Villa, sir. - Wonder Villa? It's a new resort, sir. It needs a little publicity. I cannot give you any money, but I can give you something else in exchange. What do you mean? I mean, how about a weekend's stay free for your family and your friends? I promise, sir. Tony promise, sir. - Mummy promise? - Yes, sir, mummy promise. Where do you want to put it up? Wherever you want. Okay, come. Let's go. - It's burning. - He called last night. - Let it go. - What did he talk about? You'll have to cool there. It's massive. - What are you saying, dude? - Hmm. I don't even mind going to hell, if it's a free holiday. - In hell. - Ditto. Copy-paste, bro. Should we go then? - Copy-paste! - Only if you let it go. Tiwari had come home with yet another marriage proposal. I think this will be my last trip as a single girl. After this, I'll go straight for my honeymoon. - With my to-be husband. - Ouch! "Wow, these tomatoes are amazing!" You think it's funny, huh? "Keep your day on mute." "Grab the cloud with your hands and taste it, dude." "Whistle and make some noise." "Make God sit up and notice." "The Sun will wear goggles." "The Moon will put on its dancing shoes." "Dance and make some noise." "Make God sit up and notice." "Past is crazy dear." - "We all are hazy here. - Go, go, go." "We have no worries here." "Bring your sunshine, bro." "Go easy on yourself here." - "Let the heart be cheesy here. - Go, go, go." "Feel is fizzy here." "It's the party time, bro." "Come on guys, let's hit the beach." "Trending is our dance move. You can copy it too." "Trending is our dance move. You can copy it too." "Make the road lit with your vibe." "Make it lit." "With a single swipe fix your past." "Fix it." "Stare at cute beautiful faces on Insta." "If it gets too hot, take a chill-pill." "Your supersonic swag is out of this world." "Put a tender on tinder and let's meet up." "Make some errors and some trials." "Give some missed calls and do some redials." "No matter what, just fall in love." "Make God sit up and notice." "Past is crazy dear." - "We all are hazy here. - Go, go, go." "We have no worries here." "Bring your sunshine, bro." "Bring your sunshine, bro." "Go easy on yourself here." - "Let the heart be cheesy here. - Go, go, go." "Feel is fizzy here." "It's the party time, bro." "Come on guys, let's hit the beach." "Trending is our dance move. You can copy it too." "Trending is our dance move. You can copy it too." Wow! Hey! Niceee! - Guys, the car, the car, the car. It's gone. - Hey! Oh my God, my car! - Stop! - Stop! Stop! Welcome, guys. - Bunnu! - HI! - Oh, my God! - WOW! - Guys! - Nice!! - Amar, is this your ancestral house? - No. - This is very fancy. - Wow! - This is so cool. - Nice. Oh guys, look at that. - This is huge. - Whoa! - Classy. - Wow! Amazing. Beautiful. Finally here. Not bad, Bir. Greetings. Welcome to Wonder Villa. We five will be looking after you five. Guys? This is child lab our. We cannot stay here. Yeah, exactly. No, you guys don't get it. We are the owners, not servants. This property belongs to our parents. We run it during vacations. These kids are strange. They work during their vacations? My name is... Kiara. Owner and General Manager of Wonder Villa. Montu. Owner and Head of Security. Plus room service. Ganesh. Owner and Head Chef. J. J. Patrick. Owner and Head of Entertainment. Plus Room Service. I guess this is all the staff they have here. And I am Seher. Owner, Receptionist, Help desk and Concierge. - At your service - Always. Guests, if I may have your attention please? There are five master bedrooms in this house. Three in the right wing and two in the left wing. Boys this side, and girls that side. Come on, let me show you your rooms. - I'm still amazing. - Wait a second, guys. I smell books. Does this place have a library? Yes, the library is this way. I'll see you guys later. Bye. - I think he smells - Yo, you hungry? - Always. - Yeah. I'll see you up. You think they'll serve meat? I'm coming for you. What are you waiting for? Let the way. This way. Dinner is ready. "Rocket flew off again". "Rocket flew off again". "Rocket flew off again". Ganesh, the molecular consistence of your food is perfect. Just look at this, guys. - No man, no. Come on. - So beautiful. - So symmetrical. - Seriously Sahib, - Come on. - What is wrong with you? He uses compass and protector to make perfectly round bread. You know he uses a Bunsen burner instead of a stove at home? Ganesh, today, you have proven that only a person who loves to eat can cook well. But I don't love to eat. Montu loves to eat. What!! This chicken-wing sized guy? My bicep is bulkier than you are. Look. Ganesh, you have to cook for my wedding. The groom will be of Tiwari's choice. I should at least get food of my choice. Wow! Ganesh's food combined with Tania's taunt... Simply mind-blowing. By the way, Tania is right. Right, Bir? No. Tania, why would the groom be of Tiwari's choice? You have such a good-looking handsome boy sitting right in front of you. He has already apologized to you in numerous times. He has your name tattooed on his heart. And you are still upset with him? Oh, I'm hurt. My name's spelt with an 'i" and not a "y". Ooo! "I", huh? Look, there she goes again. What about us? Please stop it, Amar. Amar, stop it. Pass me that. He is such a hogger. So tell me, what went wrong between the two of you? It's about time you tell us. 'This dude was supposed to come home to meet my parents.' No, I am not who you think I am. I am his friend. You know the compulsory Sikh best friend everyone needs to have? In his case, that would be me. Why didn't he come? A urgent meeting, Auntie. A meeting about what? A famous movie director suddenly decided to meet him. He couldn't refuse him. He is a movie star? - No, he isn't. - He isn't? But he will soon be one. Statistically speaking, millions flock to the city to be movie star. Only one in a million makes it big. And my friend Amar, is one in a million. Certainly one in a million! And what if he doesn't make the cut? Diwali bumper lottery, Auntie. He makes sure to buy a ticket every year. You know what are the chances of winning a lottery? One in a million. And like I said, my friend is... - One in a million. - For sure. Copy-paste, Uncle. Correct. Son, I have a question. What if your friend doesn't win the lottery? His father's store. - Amar Stores! - I see. You can get anything from groceries to crockery there. Auntie, they also give great discounts. If I am not wrong, his father runs the store? Yes. What does he do? He struggles, Auntie. He a struggler. You are amazing. I speak the truth. You and your friend, both, are one in a million. So, you should find him a girl who is one in a million. Please excuse us. Was that director a male or a female? What are you doing? - Stop. - Hey, I only asked because the meeting was scheduled at night. Male. - Hey Bunnu, - Sir, dessert? Stop drinking from my glass. Pia, no matter what you think, I didn't drink. Oh, man! Well done! Well done! Shut up. - I just filled my mug. - Sir, cupcake? How did it get over? Ganesh? Hold this? Can one get drunk on coffee? She is not drunk. I will hit you. You know he made doodles on my books in the library. I believe you. Bunnu, library? Actually, I believe that too. Na? So, who is doing all this? You are our guests. Why would we trouble you? Hmm. So, is a ghost doing all this? No wonder you offered us a free stay. Come on, guys, - I was just about to go pee. - It's okay. You guys are just too much. This is what happens in the horror movies. A couple of friends are just chilling on a holiday, when suddenly one of them wants to pee. He leaves and doesn't come back for a long time. He doesn't come back. And then, another friend volunteers to go find him. He too doesn't come back. Then two people leave to go look for them. - A boy, - Boy. A girl. And they don't come back. A girl, who is still there, all by herself, gets scared. Suddenly, from a distance, I am feeling scared. Very scared. You shouldn't make us want to pee too, just because you want to. I have cancelled my plan. - I am not going anywhere. - Coward. - Go. - Can I have some coffee please? - I'm scared. - Anyone wants to join me? You want to pee? Pass me that. - Let's go, Amar. - They're surely peeing in their pants. - Let's go to the bushes. - Okay. Hey, hey, hey, slow down. Why are you feeling scared? I feel scared of the things science doesn't have answers to. Bro? Can you hear a lullaby? I cannot hear anything, bro. I cannot see anything either. I am just shooting in the dark. Heard that? I can hear it. Amar! Sahib! It's going to rain. Let's go inside. I'm done. - Bunnu is calling. - Yeah, come on, come on, guys. - Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Let's help Ganesh. Let's go, Amar. Let's go, guys. Come on, why did the television have to stop right now? That's why I always believe in the silver screen. I don't want to do televisions shows. Tania, just FYI. Fine, then let's watch a movie on our phones. I just said Silver Screen, and you talk about hand held screens? Directly on phone? What is he doing? Look who's talking! He couldn't even be a part of the small screen. Yes, the revolving chair? Does anyone of you have network on your phones? No network. And in your phone? - Hey! - Oh no. What has happened? - Power cut? - This is strange. I'm bored now. - Sir. - As always. - Sir. - Hey! - Sir! - Move that away from my face. - What! - You are getting bored? - Why are you pointing that towards my eyes? - Yes. We have a board game. The guests who came before you left it behind. Yes. Would you like to play that game? What is the game? It's complicated. We couldn't figure out how to play it. Why not? Get it here. We'll go get it. Okay. Get it. - Be comfortable. - This power cut.. I think the game's called blind man's buff... - I can't see anything. - I'll be right back. It's a complicated game. Guys. - This is an Ouija board. - What is that? We have to keep our fingers on it and ask questions. To whom? To someone who is dead. Don't be scared. It's a fun game. When I was young, my brother Sonu had called my deceased grandfather. What happened? Did he come? Yes, he did. He slapped me and said, "Go do your homework!" C'mon, Bunnu. Seriously! There's no such thing as ghosts. What rubbish. I speak the truth. Don't be scared. Come on, guys. Let's show them how it is done. Do we have a ghost in this room? Please, can we play some other game? Yes. You guys will leave in a day or two. We are the ones who stay here. Rats. I think there are rats in the attic. That? Who blew the candles off? Guys, please stop it. These kids are getting scared. Tania, you are the one who is scared, and not the kids. Don't worry, kids. There's no such thing as ghosts. I can prove it. Do we have a ghost or a spirit here? If ghosts existed this planchette would have moved on its own. If there are ghosts in here, then please don't show yourself. Don't show yourself! - Down? - Who is down there? Up? Help! Help me! "The Rocket has been launched." Open the door. "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." Somebody help! Anyone here? Let me go. "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." Guys, my books. Why did you scare me! Baby, remember? - Titanic? - Shut up, Amar! Maybe this is the same house we can go... What is it? MUMMY!!! "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." "The Rocket has been launched." Ghost. Where are they? This is fun. This is so much fun. If you are providing such great entertainment for free, I wonder what you'll do when you start charging for it. Mr. J. J. Pattrick, Head of Entertainment, very well done. And... General Damager, Kiara? We want to check out. What is the procedure? - Guys, let's go. - Yes. No one is going anywhere. Why? Why are you doing this? We all leave one day. - Just let us go home, please. - NO! Look, we have nothing against you. You guys don't know who we are? Who are you? Let us enlighten you then. "Today, I want to defeat everyone." "Today, I want to LIT everything." "Start a fire," "To take us higher." "It takes a lot of fire to launch us." - "You can't dance... - The Rocket has been launched." - "You can't dance... - The Rocket's gone up your head." - "You can't dance... - The Rocket has been launched." - "You can't dance... - The Rocket's gone up your head." - "You can't dance... - The Rocket has been launched." - "You can't dance... - The Rocket's gone up your head." "I also want to fly like them." "I want to blow up today, tomorrow never comes." "I want to talk to the stars." "I want to soar high." "I want to stay next to the clouds." "I want to watch my every step." "I want to soar high." "Let's soar high." "I want you all to join me." "Let's soar high." "I want you all to join me." "Today, I want to defeat everyone."

"Let's soar high. I want you all to join me." "Let's soar high. I want you all to join me." "Let's soar high. I want you all to join me." "The Rocket has been launched." Come on, a huge round of applause for them! A huge round applause for our judges. Bosco, Caesar and Raftaar! We have four finalists, who have cracked the semifinals and made it to DID finals! Whoa! Our first finalist... Amit Dance Crew! Our second finalist, of course, it's very obvious. The Scorpions! Yo! Scorpion! Scorpion! Scorpion! And here they are, The Scorpions!

So judges, what are we waiting for? Take it easy. The one who have proved themselves by defeating, Scorpion Academy, the winners of the past five years. - Woah! - And they are... Rocket Gang! Yes. Rocket Gang. These kids have shown a lot of progress throughout the show. So please a big round of applause for Rocket Gang! Scorpions! Go on stage! Hurry up! Amazing. Judges, would you like to say something to the Rocket Gang? Kids, we are waiting for the finals. We are dying to know what you'll come up with. We want to dedicate our final's performance to mothers. Our moms, your mom, and all the moms in the world. Wow man, that's truly amazing because, mother is superior than everyone. All the best. Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! - Thank you! - Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! "Whenever you leave my side," "My eyes get wet every time." "Never get out of my sight." "Don't go away, understand my plight." "What kind of a thread will pull you back?" "I want to the lullaby you still like." "Forget everything for a second," "And swing in my arms like a baby."

"A mother's lap always feels like heaven." "A mother's lap always feels like heaven." MOM! - Mummy! - MOM! Ma! Ma! We died because of you. And got trapped in this house forever. Yes. I am sure this is a misunderstanding, kids. Statically speaking the chances of a car getting into an accident with me inside is nil. Yes, and how can you be so sure that the accident happened because of us? It... it could have been someone else car too. We really don't remember anything. Yes, I was driving the car. And we didn't hit anyone. - Absolutely. - Pia? These kids speak the truth. - Who is that? - Neil Nitin Mukesh! - Who is he? - Neil Nitin Mukesh! Those kids... - Tony? - Tony gone. Sachin! Thanks to you. Idiot. I was the one who was driving their car that night. Get it? I'll tell you how I got out here. A real estate agent came to inspect the house. I entered his body, and got out of this house. Bunnu, your slipper. What do you want? REVENGE! What do you mean? Revenge is revenge. Retaliation. Don't mistake it for anything else. Then? So I'm going to kill each and every one of them. - Revenge for everyone. - Revenge for everyone. Revenge. Oh dear god... - ...keep all the evil spirits away - Someone do something. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away.

Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Oh dear god, keep all the evil spirits away. Now it's your turn to dance. - No. No. - Look, we aren't dancer like you lot. - Yes. - That's not our problem. Now you do as we say. You are our slaves now. - What is he saying? - What is he saying? Shut up. Sorry. Get on with it. It's time you entertain us. Sing and dance for us. Because you gotta to dance to save your life. - Do something, Amar. - This is strange, man. I am an actor, so I can dance a little. But they are terrible singers and dancers. - Some discount, please? - He is right. You can make us solve a math equation or participate in a debate instead. - No, dude. - Step back. Junior Einstein. Trying to save your skin, huh? We couldn't fulfill our dream of winning Dance India Dance because of you. And we also lost the opportunity to show the Scorpions Academy where they stand. Kids, trust me, we cannot sing or dance. Right. You will want to kill us after you will see us dance. Hello! Less talking, more entertaining. "This youth is crazy." - I'm dead. - "O' my queen, stop." "Turn and look back." "The dark sunglasses look good on you." - "It suits your pretty face." - O baby. "I left in my truck." "On the way, in the road," "There came a turn," "Where I left my book behind."

"Oh, these tomatoes are amazing!" "Wow, these tomatoes are amazing!" Disgusting. Sing some other song. Prepare to get tortured again, if you don't start singing another song in the next five seconds. No, no, no. Tick-tick one. - Tick-tick two. - Guys. - Tick-tick three. - Oh no. Tick-tick four. - AMAR!! - Mummy! - Do something, Amar! - Sing something, Amar. Sing. Sing something. Do something, Amar! Sing! - Ouch, it hurts a lot! - Sing the lullaby, Amar. Amar, Amar, Amar... They fell asleep. Am I that good a singer? Hey! Why did you stop singing? Sorry, baby ghost. Looks like this lullaby puts the kids to sleep. Then why is Tony sleeping? Perhaps he's recalling his childhood days. What is the logic behind that? Do you think anything here is logical? Yeah, leave, everybody. Hurry! Bunnu! Run, run. Let's go, guys. Let's get out of here. - What are you waiting for, Amar? - Hurry! - Amar! - Run! Hurry! - Hurry up! - Go, go, go! - Fast! - My slippers. Bunnu! Mummy! Mummy! Sahib, get the engines running. Mummy! Hurry up, Amar! - Run! - Amar! Everybody's here?

We will die, Amar! Let's get out of here! - Run. - Have you lost your mind, Amar! - Let's go! - Let's go, let's go, let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! STEP ON IT! Kids, they will come back, the day they'll realize their mistake. Can you mind him for a few minutes? - I'll get some stuff. - Okay, sure. Don't trouble brother. - Okay grandpa. - Don't worry, sir. Wow, nice cars. Let's race them. Not racing. Dashing. Woohoo! You scared me. Yeah! No one will sleep. Let's go! Baby, come here! - Whoa! - Shit! - You alright? Come, come, come. Would you tell us how did you come up with that name? Who gave you that name? Yes. Ma'am, the warden of our hostel used to trouble all the students. How? Do you know about good touch bad touch? Of course. He... - He did bad touch. - What? What? And then, one day... Five. Four. Three. Two. One. "Rocket flew off again". He never touched us after that rocket touched him. And thus we got the name Rocket Gang! So Rocket Gang, tell us, why did you decide to participate in DID? Our mothers have done a lot for us. We all want to win this competition for our mothers. We all want to win this competition for our mothers. We died because of you. Because of you our dancing dream remained incomplete. I was the one driving the car. I was the one taking the selfies. Amar didn't want to, but I forced him for that selfie. I knew that it's dangerous. Oh, my God. But I, too, didn't do anything. Guys, I am feeling very bad. How will all of you live with this guilt? Huh? - I was sleeping, right? - What did you say? I was sleeping. - Pia, I was actually sleeping. - No Bunnu, what do you mean by, 'I was sleeping', huh? Don't you get the seriousness of this situation? We have killed 5 kids, Bunnu. - Pia... - No, wait. Do you think this is a joke? - I am not joking. - Please tell me he is joking. I would've done something if I were awake. - Okay guys, calm down. Guys... - You don't want to take responsibility for this, right? - This isn't about responsibility! - Calm down. - Guys, stop it. - Were you with us or not? You could have stopped the car to take the damn selfie! Guys, calm down! Think before you speak, Bunnu. You have no filter. Guys, we cannot rectify this. But we can try to do right by the kids. I have a plan. It's bizarre and you will not like it. Sorry, kids. What is the use of apologizing to us now? It won't bring us back to life. Look we know that our apology won't bring you back. But we can help you fulfill your unfulfilled dream. How? Would you like to participate in this year's DID competition? How can we? No one can see us. By using our bodies. Kids, Tony used a real estate agent's body to step outside the house. You can use our bodies. Our bodies, your talent. Wait a minute. - They will get recognition. - Yes. - They will get fame. - Uh-huh. What do we get? - Hmm. - Hmm. Will you take our name on the stage? Yes. Promise? Promise. Show your wonder. Wow! - "You can't dance... - The Rocket has been launched." "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." - "You can't dance... - The Rocket has been launched." Attack! - "You can't dance... - The Rocket's gone up your head." "Rocket flew off again". - "You can't dance... - The Rocket's gone up your head." "You can't dance..." All the other combination worked well, except for these two. I wonder why. How about if instead of girl-girl and boy-boy we go for a girl-boy combination? Yes! Enter! Go. Now your turn. A miracle indeed! We will break you. We will pull you. We will twist you. Well done, well done, well done. Confusion. "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". "Start a fire," "To take us higher." "Rocket has flown off again". - Yeah! - Yes! "Rocket flew off again". - They are all so happy. - Yeah! Happy? Guys, where's Tony? - He was with us until a moment ago. - Tony? Where is he? He was right here. - I don't know. - Tony! Come on. - Tony! - Hey, hey, hey... - Tony! - Son. - Tony... - What is happening? "Rock the dance floor." "The entire India is grooving. India, Dance India dance." The greatest Dance reality show of India, Dance India Dance. The battlefield of Dance. "Dance India Dance." "India Dance India Dance." Hello, friends. And welcome to DID. The great battlefield of the world of dance. DID's audition rounds are going to begin today. And just look at the excitement. So many people are present here. Look at the excitement in them. Over to you, Tanaaz. Of course Bhakhtyar, it's total madness over here. People from all across the country are here to try their luck. Who knows this show might end up changing their lives forever. Let's talk to some. Hey guys, welcome. - Hi! - Hi. What is your name? Rocket Gang. - OMG! Rocket Gang! - Rocket Gang! Yes, we are their fans. We had a team called Rocket Gang last year as well. Yes, we are here to fulfill their dreams. - That's fantastic. - That's fantastic! Then go ahead Rocket Gang! Rock it! - Thank you. - See you all in audition round. - Yes. - Awesome. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Welcome to DID! Tannaz, do you know who our next judge is? Let's go, guys. 3, 2, 1! And action. And our next judges are, the talented duo Bosco and Caesar. Let's begin the audition round. Whoa! "Dance India Dance." "Dance India Dance." "Dance India Dance." "Dance India Dance." Welcome to DID. So, the next group which is performing, Rocket Gang. So, please give them a DID style round of applause. Rocket! Rocket! Rocket! "Drop it!" Whoa! Whoa! "Drop it!" "Drop it!" Whoa! Scary. What a performance there! - Wow! - What a performance! - Let's invite... THE ROCKET GANG! - THE ROCKET GANG! Woohoo! Round of applause, guys. Judges, over to you. That was a satak-wala/crazy attack performance. We heard you are fans of DID Rocket Gang juniors. Your moves are tight, ...just like theirs were. So keep it up. Watching your horror act it really felt, you were possessed, I mean it was fantastic. Rocket Gang 2.0, welcome to DID! - Yay! - Yes! - Selected! - We got great comments, right? Yes. Why didn't you take our names on the stage? We were possessed, but... We told them that we are Rocket Gang. You weren't just supposed to say Rocket Gang. You were supposed to take our names. What do you expect us to say in the audition round? That we can see ghosts who take over our bodies and dance? Exactly. They would have kicked us out in the audition round itself. Guys, we have cleared the audition round. We should celebrate. - Yeah, right? - Yay! - Of course. - It's a big deal. He stays in Manhattan, - ...the business hub of New York. - I see. You'll have a nice excuse to tour America after they get married. Oh. He's an investment banker in a renowned firm there. - I see. - But the question of the hour is, why would that investment banker invest in this relationship? If Tania keeps dancing like this, you'll have to bid America, France and Germany goodbye. Oh. You can find her a local husband. Pinky, we are done here. I think you wouldn't even get a local. Mr. Tiwari... We won't allow this. Tell her! I don't care what anyone says. My daughter will do as she pleases. If she is interested in dancing, then she will dance. If she is interested in sports, then she will do sports. Everyone should have a right to live their dreams. Mom! Hmm? Do what you feel like. That's what my mom used to say. Okay? God! Why was he staring at us? Who is he? My stalker. I see. What does stalker mean? A stalker is a creep who doesn't leave you alone. Ignore him. - Hmm? - Hmm. Dance, Amar? What are you doing with your life? Didn't you want to be an actor? Why this sudden shift to dancing? What's wrong with being a dancer, Papa? There is nothing wrong with taking up any job. You just need to dedicate yourself completely to it. He seems possessed. You have no idea, Papa. "India! Dance India dance!" Please welcome our special judge, Ace Chorographer, Writer, Director Farah Khan! Guys, our next team is a wild card entry. The Scorpions! Scorpions! Scorpions! Scorpions! Scorpions! Stop. Scorpions! Scorpions! Scorpions! Scorpions! - Amazing. - What a brilliant performance! - Yeah, yeah. - Superb. - Fantastic. So judges, how did you like the performance of the Scorpion Gang? Oh my God, this was just mind blowing. - Yes. - I mean I have gone bonkers. - Rocket Gang, you guys are next. - Too goof. It's show time, guys. Let's go. Come on. After a mind blowing performance by Scorpions, - Let's go, Scorpions! - Our next contestant is - The Rocket Gang! - On cue. I always keep saying that we are tight performers. Look what we have here! Speckle sparkle! This fatso will break the stage. What did you say? She'll break the stage? - I'll break your face. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What do you think of yourself? - Just go and perform. - Guys, hurry up. See you outside. - Guys, we have to go set up. - Guys, set up the next act. - Let's go, Pia. - It's okay. "Hey dude!" "Hey..." "Hey dude!" "What say you?" "Where from you?" "What's your style?" "Can you rhyme?" "This is the right time." "This is about Dharavi, a lane in a small slum." "All the boys are smart and we are some of them." "All the boys are. Don't you dare threaten them!" "Think of the future and stop thinking of the past." "Listen. This is a new phase ahead of you." "I am highly artistic and hold a pen in my hand." "On these streets I learned everything that I wrote." "I am not poor, just hungry for music." "Hey dude!" "Hey..." "Hey dude!" "Hey..." "Hey dude!" "What say you?" "Where from you?" "What's your style?" "Can you rhyme?" "This is the right time." "Hey dude!" "What say you?" "Where from you?" "What's your style?" "Can you rhyme?" "This is the right time." "Hey dude!" "What say you?" "Where from you?" "What's your style?" "Can you rhyme?" "This is the right time." "Hey dude!" "What say you?" "Where from you?" "What's your style?" "Can you rhyme?" "This is the right time." - Woohoo! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Wow! - Fabulous. I wish I could dance like that. Isn't it? So judges, how did you like our... - Rocket Gang! - Rocket Gang! Rocket Gang! It was an electrifying grand premier performance, I think. So you know, keep it up. Keep it up! It was a great fusion concept, great fun. I think, Bosco Ceaser has said it all. I though it was one of the most unique acts. You'll were so energetic and technically perfect. All I would say, Scorpions watch out for Rocket Gang. He said he has dengue. But look there, he is clicking selfies with girls. Come, let's click a selfie. Bunnu, you had dengue, right? People find it hard to walk in dengue, but look at you, you are dancing, that too on national television. You have become a star. So tell me, Star? Sir, you are the one who told me to participate in the show. I told you? When did I tell you that? Bunnu, a selfie. Please. When did I tell you that? You didn't? It's perhaps because of the dengue fever... Stop lying. You'll have to quit the job if you don't quit the show. Got it? Come on now, smile. Hi Pia. Hi! Next week we are going to shoot for a big cosmetic brand. - Okay. - Would you like to... ...style our models for it? Wow! Thank you so much, ma'am. It's an honor. But I won't be able to do it. - I am sorry. - I am feeling bad. Pia refused such a big offer because of us. So? She is still alive. She can get another chance. People can see and talk to people who are thousands of miles away, but no one can see us, our talent, our dance. India. Dance India Dance. Fantastic. Superb. Absolutely amazing. Make some noise. Outstanding. Wow! Rocket Gang, you guys are in the next round. "Dance India Dance." Montu, they will take our names. Since we already gave them time. A bit more. I think this should work. Don't say I think. Amar, why aren't you taking the name of those kids? I'll do it when the time is right. Just trust me. Time? Amar, God knows when that 'time' of yours will come! Why are you always so angry? Yoga is not working for you. - Pass me that. - It's useless to talk to you. This? You guys!! Did I say something? Why aren't you telling her about our plan? We first need to find out whether our plan even works. Hmm. Copy-paste. Am I doing it right? How would I know, Sahib? Yes Amar, leave. I too am leaving. Bye-bye. Hey? Where to? My shift is over, sir. Bunnu, we have quite a few customers today, so, you'll have to work overtime. We have responsibilities. Come on quickly change. Sir, everyone's waiting for the rehearsals. I need to... Rehearsals for what? Such shows are a dime a dozen in this country. Once the show is over, you'll be over too. Don't come here begging for a job. Bloody mess. Don't look here and there. Have you lost your mind? Don't smile. You don't have any work ethics. When you are coming, you're not coming on time. You don't even understand. You are smiling again. You keep making excuses. You are nothing but one bloody mess. I'm paying you salary for doing nothing. What are you doing? "You can't dance..." - Where are my clothes? - Shit. What are you guys staring at? Put it down. Put it down. Put the cameras down. I'll sue you in the court. Go. Show's over. No video, no photo. Hey! Are you crazy? Out! Out! - Hey, no! Hey! - Let's see who'll offer him a job now. "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". So funny! Oh, my God! Give me that. Give me that. Oh, my God! - Well done, Kiara. - Let me see. Look at his boss. Rocket Gang killed it. Entire office will vote for you. Isn't it guys? - Yeah.. Yes. - Thank you, guys. What brings you to office? How can I forget my old friends? It's just a presentation. Long time no see, Mr. Mechanic. Good that you are here. Bathroom's flush isn't working since morning. - It's stinking. - Okay. Go, use your magical hands. Go. "You can't dance..." Oh, I see. "The rocket is dominating." "You can't dance..." "The rocket took off!" "You can't dance..." "The rocket is dominating." What I am going to present in front of you sir, is research of 6 months, just keeping in mind one thing. Your Needs! What do you need? And we have the answer! - Yes. - Shall I? - Shall we? - Sure. Shit! Sorry. I'm sorry, sir. I don't know how they came off. Shit, shit, shit. Sorry, sir. It's-it's-it's burning! Oh, my God! - It's insane. It's embarrassing. - My mistake, sir. - I am so sorry, sir. - What are you doing, man? - Be careful. - I'll clean it, sir, please. - Where is the tissue box? - I'll clean it, sir. - Where is the washroom? - Please forgive me. Can you take me to the washroom? Where is the washroom? What is happening here? - Bullshit! - Please come. Please. Shit. I'm so sorry. - Sorry. - What are you doing? Sorry, sir. I am so sorry. - Be careful now. - Go start the presentation. Presentation, yes. Here we go. "You can't dance..." Sir! Sir! I don't know... Sir! I didn't do it, sir. I didn't make it. I don't know how it ended up here. I didn't do it, sir. I am telling the truth, sir. What is this? Is it your presentation - Or your own MMS presentation? - My presentation, sir. I can't handle this anymore. This deal is cancelled. I am leaving. Please don't go, sir. It will go away. It will go away, sir. - I didn't do it, sir. - Idiot, stupid. Shit! Pandey... Want an apple? Looks like someone performed ethical hacking, which of course means Hacking for Good! But you know what? I think someone needs to hack your mind as well. You know... Apart from solving tech problems, I now fix humans too. - Get out. You are fired. - "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". "Rocket has flown off again". "Dance India Dance." The whole country is awaiting the finale of DID. Who do you think is going to win? Scorpion. Scorpions. Rocket Gang! Rocket! Rocket! Scorpion. - Rocket Gang! - Rocket Gang! Rocket Gang! All the best Rocket Gang. You love stalking me, don't you? Now your stalker will make you lose your mind. Get addicted. Passion of sunset. What is going on? "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." Let me go. I am not crazy. "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". Simply love the color of money. Pink. Pinky. Where would you like to go for shopping this time? Dubai? Europe? I was thinking we should first go to Dubai and then to Europe. She is not going anywhere. Just a suggestion, Pinky. Horoscopes don't matter. You just need have good karma. - One more thing. - Hey. It is better to stay away from frauds like Tiwari. - What is she talking? - She's talking nonsense. Tania! How did you come here? Like this. Oh shit! Pinky... My money... Help! Mummy, mummy... You play with the emotions of helpless parents and ruin other people's life to make your business flourish. You use relationships to emotionally blackmail us and sell us like products. And then, you celebrate our broken relationships. You love to take sweets when you approach your clients with marriage proposals, don't you? - Tania, I have diabetes. - I know. Hmm. Today, you will spend all night eating sweets. I'll die. I'll die. I wish. But these are sugar free ones. Huh? Hmm. "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "Rocket flew off again". "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "Rocket has flown off again". "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". "Let's fly. Let's fly". "Join along with me". Now listen, Amar and Montu will begin the act. Guys? Guys, someone has tagged us. Let's check it out. See. - No. - What is this? Then they both will sit and then you and Seher... It's been a year. Ganesh will be in the center. And then we will block that. Today is a special day. All of us have gathered here today in memory of our dear Rocket gang. Let's remember the departed soul. We... we are fans of the Rocket Gang. We are participating in the DID using their name. We have come here to seek your blessings, and to invite you for the show. We have a wish. Can we get a hug? Get in queue. Everyone will get a turn. Easy. Easy. - Why is it taking so long? - It's such a long line. Please. Ma'am, some of you can come here. Pack it. Thank you, ma'am. Here are your goods and here's your bill. Sure. Sorry, ma'am. Your bill. Please pay cash over there. Amar, it's high time. Take the name of the kids on the stage. Tania, trust me, I will. It's just not the right time. Trust you? How, Amar? You never respected my love or your dad's work. Tania, I am serious. Amar, please. Honestly, I don't know when you are serious and when you are acting. You know it feels like all of us are just characters in your film, who act according to your will. Tania, I have planned something for the kids. Hmm, I can see what you have planned. You are busy auditioning for films using the fame you got from this show. Do you seriously think so? Remember the producer's meeting because of which I couldn't meet your parents? Today is the final look test of that film. But I am here. "Why aren't we talking?" "Why am I shying away?" "You know and so do I." "O' my beloved..." "Let's talk." "Let's get together." "You agree and so do I." "We also have God by our side." "You smiled at me..." "Yes, you did..." "I have you by my side." "My prayers were answered." "It's written in the air." "I see you with the stars." "It's an unspoken sign." "Read it on my lips with your lips." Rocket! Everyone gets romantic after watching such a romantic performance. O' Bhakhtyaar! It was simply mind blowing. After looking at you guys, I too am feeling romantic. Let's keep your feelings aside. Judges, how do you feel? Oh, Rocket Gang. That was magic. Those little things in your performance were touching. It got me. But Bosco, Terence, I think Tania and Amar are in love. Whoa! I think love is in the air. Sir, how we feel is visible in our dance. Guys! Amar, so true. Because the chemistry was visible in your dance. Thank you. This was a kissable performance. I agree. Thank you. - Let's go guys. - That was fantastic. Amazing. Yeah, I'm waiting for their next performance. Rocket Gang! Woohoo! Truly deserving. They have shown great progress. Yes, we know, Scorpions are the best. Thank you. Team Rocket Gang, how does it feel to reach DID's finale? We never thought that we'd ever be on the biggest stage of dance. We are here because of the love we got from our fans. I mean, our lives have taken a new turn because of this show. - Sir! Sir! One picture. - Wow, that's great. And this is no less than a miracle that we are standing on this stage today. Actually, we are quite excited for the finale. - Oh wow, that's great. - Very true. Because it's gonna be the first time. Audience will see something quite different. We are... - What's up, jokers? - Guys, let's go. Yes, let's go. You know a Rocket Gang competed against our academy last year too? But they feared us so much that their Rocket blew up. Boom. Forever. Now you are back. You guys will blow up too, forever. Never curse anyone. You never know when God says 'So be it'. You should not think ill for your enemies either. Blah blah. Listen. Stop lecturing us. If you have the guts, then meet us at Club Nirvana, tonight. Be there. No rules, no judges. Hmm? Audience will decide, who's the best. - Guys, avoid. - Buzz off. What do you think, guys? Dude, you really need to seek this girl's permission to be there? Your father too had to seek your mother's permission... ...and the result is you. What are you saying? What say, baby? Let's show them their place? So be it. "Dance. Dance." "Dance. Dance." "Dance. Dance." "Dance. Dance." "Dance. Dance." - Ganesh! - Yo! Wow! Hey! So, what say, kids? Should we teach them a lesson? Huh? Really? So now you're thinking about us? Why didn't think about us when you were giving interviews to the media? Your life has taken a new turn, right? What do you mean? Who brought about that turn in your life? You didn't tell them that? Fans' love brought you this far, right? - Why don't you call your fans here now? - Ganesh. This isn't the time to fight. Guys, we are a team. - Yeah. - Yeah. We are not a team. And tonight, you will show the Scorpions your miracle without us. What do we do? Go, and get yourself insulted. "If you get huffy without reason, if you argue without reason." "You might get beaten up." "Don't lose your cool. Keep your fury to yourself." "Don't spread your legs out of the sheet." "Basanti, you gotta move to thrive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "If you stop, you won't survive." "You gotta dance to... stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "If you do shit, you'll get yourself fried." "You'll get yourself fried." "You gotta dance to... stay alive." "I say drop the beat, ya!" "We'll start a fire that won't stop." "We'll load ourselves with ammunition and make you pop." "We hold the beat." "We battle the crowd." "We climb on backs, we fight, we break, we come here alive." "We'll play music all night long." "We'll make enough noise to make your ears bleed." "We fall hard." "We get up and roar." "We fight, we turn, we gather, we get up and jump again." "I fold my hands before I break bones." "I twist and turn every joint in the middle of the road." "I am on a kill mode." "I am in a chill mood." "I won't take any load." "With your Baby, I'll do small talk." "I will do hip hop." "I will do lock and pop." "Without current I'll give you a shock." "On your moon, today I'll do moonwalk." "You better fear my progress." "I move the world with my back flip, you know?" "Can't you see your future?" "Are your eyes welled with tears or what?" "We are everywhere like sand on the beach." "We start last but we still come first." "You come later, just like your steps do." "Get in line kiddo, your daddy comes first." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "If you stop, you won't survive." "You gotta dance to... stay alive." "You gotta dance to... stay alive." "You gotta dance to... stay alive." "You gotta dance to... stay alive." "You gotta dance to... stay alive." "You gotta dance to... stay alive." "Your daddy can't stop". "Fight with your dad". "Will be left alone without us". "You gotta dance to stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." "Come on dance". "You gotta dance to stay alive." "Come on dance". "You gotta dance to stay alive." "You gotta dance to stay alive." Let me see. I'm sorry, I can't give you a fitness certificate. It looks really bad. It's a proper fracture. It will really harm your health if you dance now. Let's pray that he recovers soon. Yeah, he should. Doctor, he needs prayers, not medicine. - Yeah, but... - Doctor, I'll manage. - No. - Finals... He's hurt. Final is just two days away. We have worked really hard for it. - No, I cannot allow you. - Please. Amar, you can't take this lightly. - It could be a lifelong problem. - She's right. Guys, as per the rules you won't be able to perform. No, no, no, no guys, there has to be a way out. Sorry, but we will have to disqualify you. "The rocket is dominating!" Look Aamr, Our laser will come out from here and hit here. Sit, sit, sit. When the timer will run out, we'll see the illusion in this area... So what I am thinking is we'll give you a little volume... Okay guys, would you like to know a secret that Sahib and I have been keeping from you? Okay. Montu, stand in front of the mirror. Sahib, you're up. What are you doing? If this is some stupid prank... Ready, guys? Bunnu, go and rotate the mirror. "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..." "You can't dance..."

Because it was not us, but your kids who were performing on this stage through us. We never dreamed of dancing on the biggest stage of dance. It was your kids' dream. We are just a medium through which they are fulfilling their dream. So today, on this stage... They will perform. So for one final time, ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together, for the original Rocket Gang! Wow! Guys, the car is moving on it's own. I think it's the part of the act.

You have to help us this time. Please. How are you God, if you cannot even do this much for us? Let us perform for our moms, one last time? Please. What happened? - Guys, someone check what's wrong. - Did the auxiliary cable get cut or what? - Please check what is wrong. - Guys, we are losing time. - Check with the production. - We have four performances left. Check, check, check, what happened to the lights. - Call Umesh. - Checking, sir. Checking. So be it! "Whenever you leave my side," "My eyes get wet every time." "Never get out of my sight." "Don't go away, understand my plight." "What kind of a thread will pull you back?" "I want to the lullaby you still like." "Forget everything for a second," "And swing in my arms like a baby." "A mother's lap always feels like heaven." "A mother's lap always feels like heaven." "A mother's lap always feels like heaven." "Come here, my angel." "Ask for anything you want."
