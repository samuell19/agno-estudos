It's my turn for breakfast this morning, Gromit. I'd like a three-minute egg... Oh, steady on. Whoa, Gromit! Oh! Well, that went as well as could be expected, didn't it, hmm? Though I might have to make a small adjustment to the drop. A touch painful on re-entry. Cracking toast, Gromit. Any post, was there, perchance? Oh, dear, a bit steep. Oh, my goodness. Well, I'll be... They're all bills. Oh, dear, oh, dear me. We shall have to economize, Gromit. I'll have to let that room out. Oh, dear. Oh, just look at that. I'm down to my last few coppers. And those presents weren't cheap either. Well, Gromit, let's see what's on the 9:05, shall we, hmm? Here she comes now. I wonder what this can be. Happy birthday! Chuck! I knew you'd like it. Here, let me help you. You look like somebody owns you now. And that's only the first part. Come and look in here. I think you'll find this present a valuable addition to our modern lifestyle. They're techno-trousers. Ex-NASA. Fantastic for walkies. All you do is attach the lead on here. Then program in. Walkies, 10 minutes, 20 minutes. Whoops! Have a nice walk, Gromit. Oh... It's no use prevaricating about the bush. Nice walkies, hmm? How were the techno-trousers? Oh, there's someone at the door, Gromit. I wonder who that could be. Oh, it's about the room, then. Well, that's grand. Eh, would you like to come this way and inspect? I'm asking 20 a week. That would include your breakfast. I suppose you like kippers, do you? Partial to a nice black pudding, myself, with bacon, of course. I'm sure that we can come to an amicable agreement. As I say, it's a bit dingy at present. But it's surprising what a lick of paint will do, isn't it? Oh! But I don't think... That wasn't quite what we had in mind. Wouldn't you like to see- Oh, dear. Look... there's something I've got to tell you. It's, um... no pets. Does that suit you? Oh. Seems pleasant enough. Cheer up, Gromit. Surprising what a lick of paint will do, isn't it? Oh. Oh, so that's where my braces went. Wonderful things, these techno-trousers. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Lovely morning, Gromit. Oh! Thank you very much. That's just grand. Oh, thank you kindly. What do you think of that, then, Gromit? Eh? Our paying guest. Nice drop of Bordeaux, this, eh? Here's to paying guests. More cheese, Penguin? Eh? Good night, Penguin. Sleep well. Oh. That was lovely cheese. Oh-oh-oh. Oh. Yeow! It's the wrong trousers. The wrong trousers! What have you done with the controls, Gromit? Now, that'll do. Just hold on a minute. Stop it. Gromit! Stop these confounded things! This isn't funny, Gromit. The joke's over. Get me out of these trousers! Lovely day! Help! Gromit! Gangway! Sorry! Whoa! It's the wrong trousers, Gromit, and they've gone wrong. Stop them, Gromit! Stop them! Help me! Gromit, the trousers have gone haywire. Get me out! Help! Oh, I'm tired. A good doze, that's what I need: get me strength back. What a... what a shocking calami... calami... calamity. What's the game, then? Where am I? What's going on? Yikes! Gromit! Gromit! I must be dreaming. Where the devil am I? Oh! Great heavens above. Whatever is it? Help! Get me down! Help! What's the game, then? Eh? Where am I? That's quite enough. You'll be hearing from my solicitor about this. Mind how you go. You can't go taking liberties like this. I'm a respectable citizen. Most definitely not legal, this. Good grief, it's you! Now, let me out of these trousers this minute. Steady on, will you? This wardrobe's nearly new, you know. Let me out! I'll give you what for, you tyke! Excuse me. Uh, hello? I should think so too. Hey! Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do, isn't it, Gromit? Steady on. Watch where you're putting them paws. Oh, careful, lad. Oh, my goodness. It'll ruin the woodwork. Oh, there goes me knotty pine. Where are we going? I can't see a thing. What's happening? Catch me, Gromit. Don't worry, Gromit! I'm-whoa-right behind you! Hang in there, Gromit. Everything's under control. I'll have that, if you don't mind, eh? Tally-ho! Leave him to me. I'll get the bounder! Get him, Gromit! Gromit, we're doomed. Mind the table, Gromit! Gotcha! Huh? All yours, Gromit! Attaboy, Gromit, lad! Well done. We did it. Ha-ha! Thank you, old friend. Many thanks indeed. That reward money paid off all our debts. No more lodgers. More trouble than they're worth. I could just fancy some cheese, Gromit. What do you say? Cheddar? Don't forget the crackers. Ah, all's well that ends well; that's what I say. Mmm. Oh, I do like a bit of Gorgonzola.
