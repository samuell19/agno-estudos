They say there are two types of universal stories. Those of ordinary characters confronted with extraordinary stories, and those of extraordinary characters confronted with ordinary stories. The story I am about to tell you... I don't know how to classify it. Its characters are neither ordinary nor extraordinary, nor was what happened to us unbelievable. But, it wasn't anything you could consider... normal. Well then, ma'am. I've known José Vicente for some time. Have a look. The hair salon was always his passion. No! It's horrible... His tragedy is that he never had... what one would call talent. There was no way to keep Vicente's Style afloat. VICENTE'S STYLE BEAUTY PARLOR Yes, I'm really desperate, believe me... ...I'm fed up. Lucre? ...no idea how he would react... Honey? I made this decision and I'll tell him today. Imagine. Rodrigo said we should live together. I already told you, I can't stand this marriage another second. No. You know Vicente. He's useless, he's a loser. Vicente had no choice but to muster the little dignity he had left, pack his belongings in a small suitcase, and leave his house. And where did he end up? At my house. I couldn't refuse to take him in. This fallen angel was my friend. Richard Gómez. He lived in the US for two years, trying to make a future for himself in the country of opportunities, until he was deported for working illegally at a restaurant in Atlanta. The time he spent in the USA helped him learn English. I'll talk to you in Spanish so you understand. You ladies will never learn to speak English. It's impossible at your age. Mom, I know they're your friends, but at that moment, I had to tell them the truth. You did well. Yes, those old ladies are dumb. You couldn't keep wasting your time and energy. They're as deaf as a post. Thanks for understanding. Richard. When are you going to take advantage of your good looks? The same. Mom, please don't start with the same thing. It's the truth, you are very good-looking. Instead of giving English lessons, you should be in front of the cameras, succeeding as an actor. Or rather, you should be in Hollywood. I'll get out of this gutter sooner rather than later. I'll be in shape for the thousands of girls out there. They're waiting for a tasty Black man who'll spank them for being naughty... and make them happy. This marvelous ebony Adonis, this gentleman's name is Vico. He's been in jail for about two years for theft and fraud. During that time, he has devoted himself to shaping his herculean figure, according to him. You were told that this prison's comforts and well-being came at a price, right? And if you didn't pay that price, you would be faced with some serious problems. But I've had financial problems. Give me some time and I swear I'll pay you. Okay? You see, that's another problem. I can't give you more time. Man, this is sad. I even feel bad for you. - I have to cut your face. - But why? Because that's how things work here. There are consequences for not paying. Do I make myself clear? - No. - What's going on here? Vico was a lucky man. That time he had used up one of his seven lives. That day, and thanks to the inefficiencies of the judicial system that had made an error during his sentence, Vico was set free. He was penniless when he got out. He had no idea where he would go. But he always had a smile on and an unbreakable optimism. All I do is look For known landscapes In such strange places Where I can't find You Janet. A single mom. She's a good singer, but has a small problem. - Hey. - She drinks a lot. - How's it going? - Very good. - I love how you sing. - Thank you. I'm a talent agent. I would like to have a word with you. Right now? As you can see... Don't worry. I'll leave you my business card so you can call me. Sounds good? - Thank you. - Cheers. Cheers. Put it on my tab, please. Humberto Sánchez. One question. Just one question. What's your name? Janet! - What's going on? - Wake up! - What time is it? - It's 08:30. - Shit, my daughter. - I already took her to school. My alarm didn't go off. That's because it was stolen, along with the blender, the stereo, and the money I left... to pay the bills! Janet, I don't know who's the guy you brought last night, but at least think of your daughter. She lives here too. That girl is too young to understand her mom's lifestyle. And I'm your sister. Look at me! I'm your sister. I'm not your mom. You should be ashamed. Today is a very special day. When we set our growth goals for this year, many people were skeptical. That's why today, we are here to celebrate these wonderful results. All I can do is thank my team, our team, the board of directors, who have supported me so much. I thank my husband. And I want you to know that I couldn't have done this all on my own. This is the fruit of all our effort, of many people... This was supposed to be Rosario's best day. The day in which all her efforts would have been recognized. It was supposed to be a night of celebration. Well it wasn't. And if I must be completely honest, when I was in front of all those people, I felt nostalgia. I remembered when I was just an employee who worked from nine to five and had a boss, and who'd go out on Friday nights with her coworkers. I remember perfectly well. Now I'm overwhelmed by the autonomy for which I fought so much. I have to be glued to that damned phone and computer 24 hours a day. Do you know how long I've been having lunch alone? For a long time. Do you know why? Because I no longer have coworkers, I only have subordinates. People who don't respect me but fear me, because their jobs depend on me. It's ridiculous. I invested so much time, so much money, and so much energy to get here, and I didn't realize I was turning into the victim of my biggest and only enemy, from whom I cannot escape, myself. What if I told you I just had an idea? Don't look at me like that. The thing is, the company called us to provide legal advice on a contract for a new show, and I don't know these people. They don't know you, and they don't need to know who you are. What's the idea? The idea has to do with me. My name is Humberto Sánchez Guerrero, and I have a talent agency. Actually, that was always my wife Milena's, dream. Today, as a kind of homage to her, I'm trying to pick up the pieces of our company. It hasn't been easy, nor will it be, but at least, we're trying. Thank you for being here. For having answered the call. Hey, bro, what type of show will we be working in? The email didn't say anything. This time, you are not going to work as extras on a TV show. Rather, you will be imitating a gospel choir for an Andrés Cepeda show. Imitate? You mean to say we won't be singing? No. The voices of the choir will be prerecorded. You all will be lip-synching. Why don't you hire an actual choir? Because the producers of the show are interested in how the group looks on stage. They want something impactful. What time are the rehearsals? Every day in the afternoon. Could they be at night? I am a secretary at an office. But I work at night. Afternoons work perfectly for me. The same. It's better for my mom if she doesn't stay up late. Richard, stop speaking for me, I have a mouth. Mom, staying up late isn't good for you. Relax, I'll ask for time off. Thank you. Bro, why... Why is there a white guy in the group? But Mom... Look at us and look at him. I think he could be a distinguishing factor and thus, inclusive. Inclusive? Ethnic? Distinguishing? I'm not convinced. Yes. I'm here because I'm Humberto's friend. Like he said, we've worked together before, and because my wife left me... because she thinks I'm useless, and because I'm going through the worst time of my life. And if I don't set out to do something... I'll end up shooting myself. I have no problem with you being in the group. Welcome. Thank you, ma'am. Nina and Andrés are gospel singers. They will be in charge of the training and the direction, so that it all... seems believable. That's right. First and foremost, we must realize that gospel is music with a message, music of happiness, reconciliation, and harmony. It's music that you dance to with your body, your voice, your hands. With your feet stomping the floor, and your hips, and a lively spirit. Hello! The meeting was at three. Yes, I couldn't find the address, but I'm here now. That guy is a thief. People, we have to turn this thief in. You're a disgrace to the race. Now that I think of it, we should give him a good beating before calling the police. Really. It's the only way these people learn. First, give me back my money and my things. The thing is... I already sold everything, and the money... You see? See what I'm saying... Listen to me. I know you have no reason to care, but I'm really going through... I'm going through a desperate situation. That's why... That's why I did that. But I'm here looking for a new opportunity. Liar. We should kick your ass. - Enough. - I believe him. Mom, please. - Oh, ma'am. - May I suggest something? Maybe there's a solution that works for everyone. I say that we let him stay. That way, you get to keep the perfect group you put together, this young man gets the opportunity he's asking for, and with the money he makes, he can pay the lady for her things. And we get into that gospel spirit the gentleman was talking about. - That's right. - What about me? You need to be more tolerant. Amen. Five, six, seven... One moment... - You, friend. - Yes? You have to stop thinking. Let your mind forget the choreography and let your body flow. Okay, yes. That's hard for me, but fine. - You can do it. - Sorry. We'll be here all afternoon thanks to this whitey. What this guy needs is more melanin. Patience. - Patience? - Patience. Excuse me. Humberto, rhythm and flavor flow through one's blood. You either have it or you don't. This whitey doesn't have it in him. He's right. We'll do it from the top. Five, six, seven, and... If the dancing doesn't work out, don't worry. I still need an actor. And you're the best one I have. No, you don't need me and we both know it. You've done enough by letting me stay with you. - No. - Leave it at that. - Mr. Humberto, may I have a word? - Tell me, Ms. Lorenza. Well, I think I have the solution to your problem. About the dancing. Five minus two? We take five and subtract one, two, which gives us... - Three. - Perfect. Would you do me a favor? Get away from my daughter. Mom, Vico taught me to add and subtract, and it's very fun. Really, baby? - How so? - It's just fun. You are completely crazy, Mom. But it's perfect. We'll teach this poor Christian to dance, and he'll teach you to act. But look at him, Mom. He has two left feet and I don't think he can teach me anything. Richard, don't be so quick to judge. Give him a chance, you have nothing to lose. Time, Mommy. Time. Are you very busy, or what? That hurt. How could you bring that criminal to our house again? Lola, let me ask you something. Were you able to teach the girl how to add and subtract? - No, how could you... - Me neither. I don't know why, but that guy is like a wizard at teaching. A wizard? He's a thief, Janet. A thief. - Now we are coworkers. - No. If he helps me out with the girl, that's fine. Really? Don't you realize this could be dangerous? Okay. I won't take my eyes off him. I promise. I am well aware of that. Quicker. One, two. One, two. One, two. Richard! Do you see, Mom? This dummy has two left feet. Thank you, ma'am. But I better leave... No, come, Vicente. Don't leave. Relax, breathe, loosen up. Richard, concentrate on what you're doing. - You will do what Richard does. - Yes. - If he can do it, anyone can. - Mom! And one, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One. Strength! Vicente, watch out for the timing of the music. Do you know how to count, bro? - Richard. - Vicente, that's better. Good afternoon. Sorry I'm late, the traffic was terrible. All right, let's start again. You have to leave your house earlier. Punctuality is key here. - That goes for everyone. - Yes, sorry. It won't happen again. Five, six, seven, go. May the message get to you That's it. That I repent That's it, strength. That I'm asking for your forgiveness That I can't forget you Strength! And I miss you more every day Does it have to be now? I haven't had a vacation in over five years, Marcelo. Plus, Human Resources already called me. They don't like us accruing time off. Yes, I understand. But right now, I need you in the office 24-7. You always need me in the office 24-7. But this time is different... I didn't want to tell you before, because it was confirmed last night, but I finally listened to you. In three days, the people I hired from the consulting firm will arrive. They are going to help us restructure the company. What type of restructuring? We are going to trim down the operation. I was checking the numbers and you're right. We have much more staff than we need. And, as much as it hurts you, me, and everyone, we need to do something about it. Layoffs? And that is precisely why I need you with those consultants 24-7 for the next three months. One, two, three... - It sounds a lot better already. - Thank you. Sorry, was I off-beat? Mom, this isn't getting any better. I've seen a huge improvement. You two keep working while I go make coffee. You're in for the long haul. With or without sugar, Vicente? No sugar. I'm trying to stay healthy. Thanks. - Mom, for me... - Nothing for you until you learn to be a good colleague, okay? Buddy, let me put it this way, do yourself and us a favor and give up. I can see you're trying hard, but you won't be able to keep up. You have a long way to go. But your mom says I'm improving. Come on. My mom is the reincarnation of the Black Madonna. She doesn't want to hurt you. But you... are not cut out for dancing. Come, princess, the tea will get cold. Can we play a little bit? Look, it's your tea, okay? It turns out, young lady, that you've been playing for a long time. We agreed that you'd return to your homework. But the tea... What do you want? We need to talk. We have nothing to talk about, Alex. I'll request the girl's custody. It's obvious this isn't a good place for Lily. You work every night and sleep during the day. You're still drinking and you won't give up your crazy lifestyle. What if I told you you've been misinformed? I no longer work at night. I sing with Andrés Cepeda now. We're making an album, and going on tour. You can shove your threats where the sun don't shine. Who's the young man? That's none of your business. You better get a lawyer. You'll need one. Tell Lily I say hi. Cepeda? My friend, the District Attorney's office may find reasons to issue another warrant for your arrest, and then you're screwed. So I suggest you hit the road, and the sooner, the better. How can you suggest that? - You're my lawyer. - That's why. I'm telling it like it is. Remember, you got out due to the expiration of terms, not because you demonstrated your innocence. Cheers. Sir, it's just that... - I can't run away right now. - Why not? Well... I have a job. Now then, a job or a friend with benefits? Well, that too. What a character, that's great. Cheers. Speaking of which, sir... Janet, that's her name... She's having problems with her ex-husband. He wants to take her daughter away. I don't know... Would you be able to help her? Could you give her some legal advice or something? I'm desperate I miss you more everyday - Stop short. - ...four, and... Wait! You all start first. Let's go. Five, six, seven, and... Telling you That I repent That I'm asking for your forgiveness That I can't forget you... Come on. Come on, come on. Smiling. Let's go. - Have a nice day. - See you later. Can you tell me what's going on with you? It's the first time you're late, and this was a very important meeting. Also, what's with that attitude? You treated the consultants as enemies. I told you, the traffic was horrible. Please, Rosario, be more creative. I'm telling the truth. Why were you so aggressive with them? I only gave them my opinion, Marcelo. That wasn't your opinion two months ago. Let me remind you those consultants are here thanks to your report and all the recommendations in it. What if I told you I rushed to my conclusions? The first thing we'll do is get a full-time job for this lady. The job at the choir. Does it count? Yes, it counts. But a stable job would be much more effective. Remember, the lie you told your ex about the Andrés Cepeda thing won't work in you favor. I couldn't let myself be humiliated by that idiot. Now then, dear. That's when it's most useful to keep your cool. In conclusion, do we have a chance to beat him or not? It's so sweet that he said "we." We'll fight the good fight. A friend of mine runs a call center and he owes me a favor. I'll ask him to get you a job there. But I'd have to quit the choir. Well... That would be ideal, but it's up to you. Marcelo was in shock. So? It's going to be a long fight with him and the consultants. He's set on downsizing the staff. And if I want to convince him otherwise, I have to offer an alternative. Do you have one? Not yet. But I'll look for one. And I need time to do that. Tomorrow... before the rehearsal at the theater, I'll quit the choir. No, don't do that to me. Please. I'm faced with a family emergency, Mr. Humberto, and I have to travel out of town. Stay for the rehearsal and we'll talk afterward. Sounds good? Are we ready? - No, we're not ready. Okay. - Mr. Mario... Guys, please. I want you to get four things into your heads, if you have one. First, I wanted real singers. Real artists. The producers want extras, so here you are, extras. So I'll be watching you. I won't take my eyes off you. Two, I don't like being talked back to. My word is God's word. Three, I don't allow for mistakes. Four, there are only two indispensable people in this project, Cepeda and God. Who's God? I am. Is that clear? Who is that guy? The director. Let's rehearse. Enter gospel choir. Enter. - Let's go, run. - Enter, enter, enter. No, no, no! Cut, cut! Humberto! - Humberto! - Yes, sir. What part of, "I don't allow for mistakes" wasn't clear? What part? The lady has problems with her hip, it takes her a while to walk. What do you want me to do? Call a surgeon to do a hip transplant on her? Get that old hag out of here. She's in the way, get her out. Talk about a sticky situation. - Guys, come... - So, Humberto. Does my mom have to leave? Unfortunately, timing in choreography is very important... If that's how it is, I'm out too. Didn't I tell you, Mom? Sooner or later, these people would let us down. Humberto? I hate to do this to you, but if Ms. Lorenza is out, I am too. Okay, guys, let's not get so radical over this. - What if we all quit? - What? Time is in our favor. The show is soon. They won't be able to hire another choir. The director told us that nobody here was indispensable. Except for Cepeda and himself. Did you not hear him? I invoked him. Humberto, guys! How's everything going? Mr. Andrés. It's going so-so, Mr. Cepeda. Why? What happened? - He's scolding him for being abusive. - Well done. I'm afraid we're becoming enemies with Herr Direktor. With God. We'll slow down the choir's entrance on stage. - Yes, sir. Thank you. - No, don't thank me. If it was up to me, I'd kick you out. What are you laughing at? But since you went crying to Cepeda, I have to put up with you. But it won't be forever because I've got you here. Right here. Sooner or later, I'll kick you out onto the street like dogs. This won't last forever. What are you, people? You're losers. Mediocre people trying to look like artists. You're only here because Cepeda has a good heart. More so than he should. You all made a mistake. You messed with God. And God doesn't like to be challenged by small people like yourselves. You want war? War you shall have. And you'll lose. One more thing. I'll make sure that every door will be closed to you everywhere. They'll be closed to you like this, in your faces. Is it because we're Black? No. I'm gonna give him... Calm down, everyone. Please, calm down. That idiot declared war on us, and war he shall have. We won't be kicked out of the show that easily. So you didn't quit. No. I didn't quit. I don't know how I'll manage to be at the company and the theater at the same time, but it doesn't matter. We won't let him beat us, or my name isn't Rosario Ibarguen Casien. There's nothing like a common enemy to unite a group and restore their faith in teamwork. People, we have to show that redneck that slavery in Colombia ended over 171 years ago. We have to show him the will and tenacity of the race. Yes. - He must respect Blacks. - Yes. And you, Vicente, I officially declare you Black. Oh, yes, my race. Booyah! Vicente, hold your horses, bro. Now more than ever, the choir needs to pull through. We'll show that snob what we're capable of. What, you don't believe me? Yes, I believe you. It's just that... I really like you, Janet. You fascinate me, you... Don't be confused. In spite of what's happened with Lily, and now that we're coworkers, I haven't forgotten what you did to me. Besides, right now I'm not looking for romance. So please, let's focus on what's important. You're the boss. SEWING SHOP - Is this yours? - Yes, it's mine. - Did you try it on already? - Yes. Thanks so much. Let's see. Oh, that's great. - Where's yours? - I want us to try this one. Thanks so much. Marcelo, listen to me, okay? I have a trip planned for that date with Antonio... No. You didn't understand me. I am facing some issues with my marriage. And if we don't do something now, it will all go to hell. Yes. Yes. I'll leave you... I'll leave you the proposal papers for you to study and review. I just want to ask you a favor. Don't make any decision until I return. Okay, thanks. - Hello, Janet. - What's up? Sorry to bother you, but a letter arrived. A letter from who? From Family Court number 23, Janet. And what's it say? It says you have to be there in three days for the first hearing regarding the custody of the girl. How did you get this number? We have your number, friend. We are very efficient. We know where you live, and what you are doing. By the way, are you ready for the opening night? Maybe I'll come to see you. Why are you calling me? Why? To remind you that you owe us some money. And to warn you that if you don't pay up in a month, the choir will have to play with dolls, or I don't know... Just think about that, buddy. When will you stop smoking that shit? - Hands up. - Up, up. Look at that idiot, he's slow. - Hold it, left, up! - That old lady moves faster than him. Feel the light. - And down slowly. - Feel the light. - Steady. - That wasn't slow. Let's do it again. I have to put up with this again? It was a difficult hearing. Janet's ex's lawyer didn't hold back. He accused her of being irresponsible. Of not spending time with her daughter, of drinking excessively, of bringing men home... and of being a liar. He easily found out that her work with Cepeda was mostly false. That she was just an extra. It was a hard blow. What do you mean she's asleep? To be completely honest, she's very drunk. She knew today was the opening. Yes, I know. Today she had an appointment at the Family Court and they gave her bad news, so she went into a crisis. This can't be happening. Not tonight. Marcelo is here. And he's with the investors. Baby, right now you need to calm down, okay? The problem is he thinks we're on a trip. But if he sees any of us, I'll be in trouble. No, baby, he won't realize that I'm here. Don't worry. I need you to do exactly what I say. I need everyone on the stage in five minutes. Everyone. Okay? - Five minutes. - Yes, sir. Vicente. What's up? Did you talk to Janet? She's home. Very drunk. Shit. What do we do? We have half an hour to bring her here. - Okay. - Four minutes left. Yes, sir. So? Can you ride a motorcycle? Good evening, Bogotá. I have the will The time and songs to sing to you I have stories, I have things to tell you But today, I have your arrival And my hand I will give you Janet, can you hear me? I imagine right now you must be feeling how I felt a few weeks ago. I had a house, a business, a woman I adored... A woman who got fed up of living with a loser. And it got to the point where I felt like I wasn't needed at home, that I was a redundancy, someone who was in her way. I even embarrassed her. I felt miserable. Believe me, that's the worst. I don't know... Because of inertia, or Humberto's persistence, I joined the choir with low expectations. But now, I feel that I'm part of something, that I am somehow necessary. I've found a little place in the world. I know this won't last forever, but while it lasts, I'll do anything to defend it. That's why I'm here. Because you are a part of what keeps me alive. I need this more than ever. I don't need more than that. Nor do I need less, Janet. Please help me. And help yourself. Don't look back to the sad past Don't refuse me if love is yours Come sit by my side Look at the sun That is rising I have the will The time and songs to sing to you I have stories, I have things to tell you But today, I have your arrival And my hand I will give you I will give you I have the will Boss, what's going on? Vicente hasn't called. - They should be on their way. - What about Andrés and Nina? Why do you think they aren't here tonight? They went to Cali for a performance. We must trust in God. So be it. I go and I leave everything I gave you I go and I leave my life behind Vicente, sorry but at this speed, we'll never get there. Why don't you let me drive? Relax. With all the coffee I had and the words you told me, I'm more than awake. Okay, do it. Don't worry, I know how to drive, so you're safe with me. - Humberto, listen. It's you now. - Okay. Guys... Finally. Let's go, quickly. Let's go. Quickly. Give it all you got. Break a leg. Enter gospel choir. My songs travel Across the wind Emotions turned into lament Smoke signals That you won't answer But I will not give up Until you come back to me I send you a message in a bottle Lost in the sea of your indifference I know I am to blame if you don't love me How can I make you understand? May the message get to you That I repent That I'm asking for your forgiveness That I can't forget you Get the message to make you reconsider Convince you to come back I'm desperate I miss you more everyday If I could talk to you telepathically You would know how much I can love you If my feelings could reach you You wouldn't hesitate to forgive me May the message get to you That I repent That I'm asking for your forgiveness That I can't forget you Get the message to make you reconsider Convince you to come back I'm desperate I miss you more everyday I speak from my heart Pressing the wound You made in my heart when you left May the message get to you That I repent That I'm asking for your forgiveness That I can't forget you Get the message to make you reconsider Convince you to come back I'm desperate I miss you more everyday That I can't forget you May the message get to you That I repent That I'm asking for your forgiveness That I can't forget you We did it! We did it, Mom. We did it. - We did it! - I'm emotional. You see that it can be done? How wonderful. Divine. Do me a favor. Can you explain to me why you're celebrating? I really don't understand. What are you celebrating? It was a shitty performance. Your tempo was bad, you came in late, and everyone was overacting. It was awful! Congratulations, guys! You were fantastic! I loved it. I love you all very much. I love you all very much and I'm thankful. Thank you, Maestro. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Thanks so much for appreciating our work. Do you believe him? - He's the artist. - You know why he's saying that? Because he's excited about the show. And because he feels pity. But that won't work on me. Don't celebrate just yet. I won't accept one more mistake. I don't give second chances, and I don't feel pity. No. I don't feel that at all. You'll see who I am. "You'll see who I am." - How are you? - Good, thanks. - How was your trip? - Very well. Could you sort things out with Antonio? We are on a good track. You're on a good track, that's great. Would you believe I saw the show? And those dark glasses and that curly hair looked great on you. I didn't tell you because I didn't know how you would react. I didn't know if things were going to work out. But if you want me to be completely honest with you, I'm happy to be part of the choir. So much so, that if I had to choose between the choir and this company, for which I've done so much, I would choose the choir. So I would understand if you asked me for my resignation letter. I only ask that you allow me to present the proposal I sent you. It's the last thing I ask of you. I owe it to all my colleagues. No, I just wanted to congratulate you. I loved the show. Plus, Rosario, there's no need to present anything. I read your proposal and I liked it. The consultants are leaving this afternoon and we will fix things without firing anyone. I think sometimes... No, not sometimes. You are always right. We owe a lot to these people. And I think we'll make them part of the solution. Thank you. What I'm about to tell you stays between the two of us. I've heard that we might tour the country with the show. You're kidding me. There are even invitations to go to the US, how's that? I don't believe you. What's going on? Humberto? Nice to meet you. I'm sure you all were unaware that this beauty was in prison for two years for the crimes of theft and fraud. And he got out because the judicial system is inefficient. But what's most important is that during his stay at the "university," this gem acquired a series of debts. Debts that allowed him to live well. Debts he has not paid, and if he doesn't pay, they'll cost him his life. Now then, there are two options. One, either you all pay up for this gem, or you'll have to find another Black man for the choir. Because we will wipe this guy off the map. What do you say? I don't know how, but I'll pay you back, okay? I swear on San Pacho. What you have to do is get the money you owe. What I gave you will buy you time, but it won't solve the problem. Can I continue in the choir? When the payment is due, the season will have ended. I'll see what I can do. What a shit show, buddy. Vico, so you know the underworld? Because I need someone to do me a favor and I am willing to pay. I'm sick of everyone treating me like an idiot. I've just been to the police station. They are under arrest for physical assault. Why? They beat up the man who was going out with Vicente's wife. I knew that whitey would cause us problems. People like him always mess up. And he messed up. No, Richard. I won't let you talk like that about Vicente. You've forgotten that you yourself named him officially Black. Mom, that has nothing to do with this. Stop with the excuses. We'll talk about that later. Look. This isn't the education I gave him. - Mom, but you know that... - Enough. Calm down. Nina and Andrés will stand in for Vico and Vicente tonight while we sort things out. Sorry for opening my mouth. This will be the perfect excuse for that white guy Mario to kick us out from the choir. Why? He needs a choir and a choir is what he will get. - Don't say I didn't tell you so. - Let's rehearse, please. Humberto, come. Tell me. - You think I'm a dumbass, don't you? - No, sir. You think I didn't notice you're missing two people? They had family issues and they couldn't come. What? They had family issues and they couldn't come. Family issues. So, if someone's dad got caught up in a fishing net, or if someone's mom's canoe sinks, it's my problem, right? Not yours. And the solution is to jeopardize the show and start to improvise. Mr. Mario, Andrés and Nina are actual gospel singers. What's more, they've been with us the entire time. They know the show. - They're professionals... - Enough. Listen to me, Humberto. Had the producers needed professional singers, we would have professional singers here. But we need extras. And that's what these people are, extras. That's why you're here. So I need the same choir or this will be the last time you all set foot on stage. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. Crystal clear, Mr. Mario. What's up? Yes. Here I am with that tasteless man. And then the police came and told us a lawyer had bailed us out. - The process is still... - Pending. But we could go. Lawyer? And where did you two get a lawyer? That was the weirdest part. We didn't call anyone. So, buddy? - No idea. - The Holy Spirit. I called upon him last night and he made it happen. That's nice, Ms. Lorenza. I'm glad you guys are safe. - Thanks. - What the hell were you thinking? How could you go around pretending you're thugs? Didn't you think about the rest of us? You can do what you want with your life, I don't care about that. But, unfortunately, this show requires the same group every time, I will ask of you that, until the season ends, you make the effort to maintain a sense of responsibility. After that, you can all go to hell. And I hope I never see you again. It all went very well, as always. Yes, Humberto was furious with Vicente and Vico. They almost didn't make it. By the way, I haven't thanked you for what you did. You saved our lives. My pleasure, my love. Fine, but what did they tell you? That it was the Holy Spirit's doing. How about that? Oh, yeah? Is that my new qualification? I like it. Well, I'll reduce the price of my legal services, but you owe me the bail. I'll pay you when I get home. I have some ideas that you will love. That sounds very good. - Kisses. - Okay, baby. See you soon, my favorite lawyer. Talk to you later. Sign it. Sign right there. That's it. - May God return the favor. - Thanks. - Thank you very much. - No, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. And that's no small amount. I'm sorry, but I have nothing for you. I have to deduct what you owe Janet and what you owe me. Would you like to talk to her? No, we'll leave it at that. Thank you. Vico. A much needed relief in your hour of need. Think of it as a bonus. And don't tell anyone. Thank you. Boys, girls. Thanks to all of you, this show not only is a reality, but a success. So I want you to give yourselves a huge round of applause right now. I also have some news you'll love. We've just signed with the Municipal Theatre of Medellín and they want us to be there for one month in the city of the eternal spring. One other thing, I want you... to give a huge round of applause to our gospel choir, that will be saying goodbye today. This is their last show. A farewell applause. Mr. Mario, look. Tell me... We won't be performing in Medellín? Exactly. You're not going. Please understand that we cannot spend a fortune paying for transportation, hotels, food, since you guys eat a ton, per diems, when we can find people to help us there in Medellín, who can do the same job. Please, understand one thing. You guys aren't a choir. You guys are extras. And extras can be found anywhere. Have a good last show. Today I feel pain, right here... ciao. I'm going to punch him... - What's that? - It's nothing, Mr. Mario. Let me know if I can help you. We are going to talk about this among ourselves. Let's wait for everyone to leave. You don't do that. Mr. Humberto, we have to do something. Are we going to allow this? We are part of this show. We are an important part, you said so yourself. Are we going to let this dumbass mistreat us? He wants us to think we're maggots. We have a responsibility with Mr. Cepeda, who's such a good person. We can't abandon him. - What can we do? They don't want us. - Let's talk to him. Ms. Lorenza, the problem now is not about good will, it's about the budget. What then? We let our guard down and do nothing? We're going to Medellín. We're going to Medellín on a donkey, in a car, in a canoe, whatever it takes. I have a cousin there who can take four of us in and... Well, I have an uncle who lives in Jardín. It's not exactly Medellín, but it's close. And he has a farm. We could put some more people there. It's available. - Really? - Yes. Even if we go by bus, we don't have money for tickets. And what about food? We could do something to raise funds. I don't know, a raffle, a bazaar, a fair. A game of bingo. I could cut hair for free. I could sing. I don't know how I can help, but I'll do whatever is needed. That's the spirit. - So? - Humberto? Okay. We are not poor. And we're not dead, so Medellín, here we come. - Okay? - Good. - Ms. Lorenza, come with me. - Yes, you're very diplomatic. Sure, what? - ...she's very good. When she comes... - Mr. Andrés. May I have a few words? No. We're on our way out. Mr. Andrés, sorry... We understand that for the shows in Medellín, due to budget constraints, it's difficult for us to travel with you. Impossible. Yes, it's a shame. We have a proposal. We can go to Medellín and be there for the shows for the same amount you pay us here in Bogotá. No. We don't want to come off as pretentious. But the show needs us and we don't want to abandon you right now. Well... I think it's a great idea! How awesome, Mario. Can you imagine? And we can help them pay for the trip so you guys can stay with us in Medellín. - Thank you. - Of course. Thank you, Mr. Mario. Thank you so much. - Mario. - Thank you, really, Mr. Andrés. Thank you, God bless you. Guys, we're going to Medellín. We're going to Medellín! WELCOME - CASINO Ladies and gentlemen. It couldn't have turned out better. This was a huge success. We're going to Medellín. Again. Again. I have to learn the song by the time we get to Medellín. - Do you want something to eat? - Yes. Okay, we'll make a pit stop soon. - Great! - Okay? Okay, but we can't take too long, okay? Sorrows wash away with seawater Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with seawater Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with seawater Humberto, what can we do? Those guys are very close. There's nothing, boss. - What? - I didn't find anything. Do you know where's the money? Come on! Where's the money? I already told you. Vico took the money. I have to apologize, especially to the ladies, for this very uncomfortable situation. It's not up to me. I have commitments, you understand? I need to know where your friend Vico is. Would anyone happen to know where he went? Do you know what will happen if I don't find Vico? Do you know what will happen? I may have to retire. But I may have to retire in a coffin. Oh, my God. Oh, poor guy. You don't know anything about me, I'm a married man. I have two girls in college. My two girls, and if I'm not there, who will pay for their studies? I want you to understand how painful it is for me. My wife can't work, and if I don't work, who will pay for college? Oh, it hurts. Now then, boss. Cheer up. I'm going to ask you all a favor. - No, no. - No, no, no. - Wait. - I really hate to have to do this. If you guys don't tell me where Vico is, I'll have to kill you one by one. What else can I do? - Put it down. - Please tell me... I really hate to do this, but if you don't tell me, I'll have to... No, he's in Palmira! He's in Palmira. He said he had to go visit family. But where in Palmira? Palmira is big. Ask for the Guerras, everyone knows them. He said his mom was sick, he went to visit her. - Take advantage... - If you are lying to me... Or if one of you is lying to me. I swear on my wife, Mr. Gus. Look, I'm a family man too. You guys have a car. If you hurry, you'll get him. I swear. I swear to God and on my daughters, - if you're lying... - No, no, no. Don't make me kill one of you to prove I'm serious. - No, no, no. - Why don't you kill one of them? No, no. - Mr. Gus! - You don't have to kill anyone, man. Guys, let's go. Quickly, please. This can't be happening to us. I'm worried about Vico. They look like they're very bad people. Bad? Vicente, why did you give him away like that? We lost our friend anyway. But we didn't have to send the thugs after him. So one of us should pay the consequences? - Richard, don't be dumb. - Calm down. - Calm down! - Enough, family, calm down. Vico's not going to Palmira or the bus station, or anywhere. He's fine. Want to see the message he left for us? Humberto and Vicente can tell you why I had to leave you all. But if you're watching this video, surely... You've run into the people who are after me. First, I'd like to apologize for all the trouble, and I'd like to tell you that for someone like me, who's never had anyone or anything in life, you guys... are the best thing in my life. I didn't know... I didn't know what it was to love someone, or to be loved, and you guys gave me that opportunity. I hope we'll cross paths again. But for now it's best I stay away. Vicente knows where the money is, so... Don't worry about that. Good luck with Mr. Mario and I know Humberto will find a solution for me not being there. Janet... Give the girl a hug for me. And take care of her. Take good care of her. Take care of each other. I will always carry all of you in my heart. Take care, okay? Hello? Yes, that's me. Didn't we supposedly trick those people? Supposedly. But they just told me they have Vico. And that if we don't bring them the money right away, they'll kill him. - I don't know. It could be a trap. - No. I tried calling him and he didn't pick up. We have to call the police. It's the only solution. They warned me not to. We can't take that risk. They may hurt that boy. We have to go and see what they want. Oh, Ms. Lorenza. Do we have to go? Yes. We won't let you do this alone. Or will we? We can leave the others somewhere, but we are going with you. Well, it's not all the money I expected. But I feel bad for harassing you. And I could do something with that truck of yours. Where is Vico? Go get the Black guy. I'd like to thank you all, on behalf of myself and my daughters for your solidarity. Really, you saved our lives. What do the girls study? My oldest studies law. She wants to be in Congress. My youngest is studying criminology. She wants to be district attorney one day. You must be proud. I'm very proud, she's the best of her class. You almost scared me to death. You'll forgive me, but happy endings... They make me emotional. So? What will we do? We go to Medellín and do our job. Mom, do you realize we have no money? We have no car, let alone time. Right now they must be beginning the rehearsal. We have no way to get there. You're sure you'll make it? Never. I love you. - Yes. There. - Mario. - Sir. - How's everything going? Everything is good on my end, sir. But the choir never showed up. The damn choir never showed up. I warned you, sir. They haven't even called. They won't reply to my messages. Nothing. - You think something happened to them? - Of course. They found work somewhere else where they'll get paid more. That's how they are. I warned you, sir. What a shame, I really liked them. They were good. Don't worry, Maestro. I already got us another group in Medellín. Better qualified and for the same price. And much healthier. Those people had many vices. They were bad people, didn't you see their tattoos? Men with earrings, with their hair... Fine, Mario. Okay. Guys, I have a confession to make. I'm not a secretary. I am an executive at a multinational company, and I am married to a very successful lawyer, who... got Vico and Vicente out of jail. His firm provides legal advice for the show we're in. You don't believe me? Yes, we believe you. We already knew it. I overheard you the night of Vicente and Vico's mishap. And I told them everything. - Why didn't you tell me anything? - We didn't think it was necessary. It's just that, look... In this group, it doesn't matter where you come from. We no longer care about the money, and all those dumb things that most people care about. What brings us together is the joy of being together. You see? We know we won't change the world, but... We all have changed during this time. And that's all we need. That's my Lorenza! I managed to get them out of here. No, no. No, no, no. No. We had an agreement, and you guys didn't show up. Leave. You came here for nothing. Go back. We already did the rehearsal with other people. It went great. Mr. Mario, we understand perfectly well what you had told us, but we made a huge effort to make it here. We've been through hell. And if you decide that we can't perform because we weren't in the rehearsal, we'll accept it, because, after all, you're the boss. You're God. But if that's how it's going to be, before we leave, I will personally leave your fish face spinning on the table like an old vinyl record. So that you never forget to respect the extras. - Security. - Tyrant! - Security! - Sardanapalus. - Guys! You made it. - Mr. Andrés. - That was the deal, Mr. Andrés. - Very good. Thank you. Maestro, they were threatening to hit me. They said unspeakable things about my face. - I'm not well, sir. - You know what? I think it's great that you're here. I feel better with you on stage. So thank you so much. Have fun. I'm glad you're here. - Thank you, Mr. Andrés. - Let's go. - That's enough. - I feel bad, sir. Guys, to your places. Let's go. Get off. Get off. Don't touch me. Thank you so much, Medellín. We do this with love for you. The next song has a message of love and forgiveness, and it's called El Mensaje. One, two, three, four. What happened? - What happened? - What happened? Mario. What happened? What happened? What are you doing? What's going on? What is this choir doing? What's... - Let's follow her. - Yes. Without fear Oh, my God. They've really done it this time. I can Thanks to you I discovered That I can live Without fear You make me feel That although the sky is gray I can It's dreams, dreams, dreams That make great men That make good men Of grand triumphs Of feet on the ground This world we know I don't know if it will ever end But the time that I have I have to love and to tell you Thanks to you I already discovered That I can live Without fear Yes, you make me feel That although the sky is gray I can -Nothing is wrong -Like the morning sun -That comes through the window -S orrows wash away -W ith sea water -That splashes in my face and runs Drops of rain On my window Sea water Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away With sea water Nothing -Nothing is wrong -Sorrows wash away -Sorrows wash away -With sea water Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with sea water Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with sea water Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with sea water Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with sea water Will you really commit to me like a serious man? Will you continue to love and accept Lily? Will you solve all your legal problems and get a steady job? What's more, will you be able to love me as I am? Messy, with a bit of a temper. A bit. If you want a chance with me, say "yes" to all of the above. No exceptions. Can I think it over a bit? No. Hey. Yes. Yes to everything. - Dumbass. - You're the boss. This is your last chance. - Don't waste it. - I won't. I promise you. Aren't they such a great couple? - You must be kidding me, Mom. - What? It's all make-believe. Those people have lots of things to sort out. Especially him. Yes. I'm sure he'll end up in jail sooner or later. Not necessarily. My husband was reading his file and he thinks that there's a possibility of getting parole if he promises to behave. And we'll talk to the expert on family rights at his firm so that he can take over the custody case of Janet's daughter. We think she has a good shot at winning. Do they know this? Why do you think they're so happy? I told them just now. - You're an angel. - No. I'm married to the best lawyer and the best person in the world. Someone who reminded me that to be happy in life you don't always have to be competing for success. And the simple things should remind us that we don't have to arrive first, but we have to arrive. Little brother, thank you. Thanks to all of you, especially you, who first joined me, I didn't let Milena down. Wherever she may be, I know she'll be proud of this choir and what we've done. You're right. Maybe she was the angel who was taking care of us. I'm sure of it. And I'm the one who has to thank you. Because all my life, I've been trying to make other people happy. And after this adventure, you know what I think? I no longer want to be the best hairstylist, or the best dancer, or the best actor. I don't want to try and be an artist. You know what I want? I want to do what I feel like, what my heart tells me to do. It doesn't matter if I'm the best or not. This is thanks to you. Thank you. The audience was happy with Cepeda, the musicians, the show, and the choir, somewhat. I'd also like to make an announcement. We met with American businessmen who want us to perform in Miami and New York. This time, the choir... Look, let's be clear. I'll say it in your language. Goodbye Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with seawater That's it. Thank you so much for the very important information. We'll need you to confirm the dates as soon as possible. Because getting to Miami and New York will be harder than getting to Medellín. Hail Mary, idiot. But we'll get there... one way or another. Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with seawater Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with seawater And Mario doesn't leave Nothing, nothing is wrong Sorrows wash away with seawater Nothing, nothing is wrong -Sorrows wash away with seawater -Dance, Mario! What happened? Who's in the control room? It's very dark. I'm surrounded. Security! Who touched me? Man or woman? Who was it? Security, please. It's the dreams, the dreams, the dreams That make men big That make men good That makes them triumph From head to toe, oh This world we know May one day end But the time I have, I have To love and hold you Thanks to you I found out That I can live Without fear Yes, you make me feel When the sky is grey That I can do it -Nothing -Like the sun in the morning Nothing's wrong -Through the window -Sorrows are washed away -By sea water -Is the clear water that splashes my face and runs -Nothing -Rain drops -Nothing's wrong -On my window -Sorrows are washed away -Ah la la eh -By seawater -Water, seawater Nothing Nothing's wrong Sorrows are washed away By seawater Nothing Nothing's wrong -Sorrows are washed away -Sorrows are washed away -And pains leave -By seawater They just walk away Nothing Nothing's wrong Sorrows are washed away By seawater Nothing Nothing's wrong Sorrows are washed away By seawater Nothing Nothing's wrong Sorrows are washed away By seawater Nothing Nothing's wrong Sorrows are washed away By seawater
