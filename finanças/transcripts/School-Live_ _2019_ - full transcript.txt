Original Subtitles by Enriquedem Remastered by Rayden (Otakurabumon) Kurumi, you should look where you're going! Are you okay? It hurts... Oh, this might take a minute.. This again? Don't you have a teacher who can make a proper bandage? That's rude. I'm trying to fix it. I'm just kidding! There are people that excel when they are in a club, but then suddenly struggle when love is involved. How do you know? I see how you look at him His name is Katsuragi-kun, right? I said, how do you know? Ebisuzawa-san, you come here often enough... and when I tried to figure out why, I finally realized that. Come on... Oh, you also wear the same bracelet. Woah, is that so? There's a student here from class C... who skipped class. I'm Takeya Yuki. I didn't skip, I'm just recovering from my condition. You brought manga, so your words aren't that convincing. Huh? If you're that healthy, you don't need to lie down anymore. You should go home. This is not your home. Come on, Megu-nee... Megu-nee? This is teacher Megumi. Refer to me as Ms. Sakura. Thing is, you don't feel like a teacher. You're no different from us. She also brought this! What's his name? Guuma-chan! Don't hug him. The infirmary is very peaceful, so that's why I brought it. So immature, right? I don't want you talking to me like that, Takeya. Come on, go home. No way, I want to stay here! Don't say such silly things, and take these with you. Okay! Bye, Megu-nee. Don't call me Megu-nee! Is it okay to joke around like that? She's a bit strange, isn't she? Even though she isn't ignored, she's still somewhat behind in her social development That's why I consider this room a shelter. You have good instincts. You can pick up on so many details about your students. What do you mean by good instincts? Thank you for today! Bye, Megu-nee! Surely she did that on purpose... (Bye, Kurumi!) Bye! Kurumi, want to stop by that family restaurant? Umm...not today. - Okay, See you later! - Bye! Is your leg okay? It's okay, really! Senpai! You're pretty clumsy, huh? Sorry for making you accompany me. Well, I'll admit that I wanted to. However, I think this is the first time we've done this. Even though we always meet when we go to the club activities. but you always go home with boys. That's because, when I graduate I will definitely miss them. Will you major agriculture in college? Is your line of study okay? You're starting to sound like my mother. However...my reason for joining the club... is... because my parents are annoying, that's why I'm here. Looking for shelter. Huh? Sure, shelter. Woah, are you hurt again? What's wrong? Romance consultation? How'd you know?! I can see it written all over your face. Something happened, so I immediately came here to ask for advice. What is it? I recently walked home with him. Really? Is that so? Eavesdropping again. Drop it... So, what's next? Well...It's hard to talk about this. Isn't that a good sign? Then what's the problem? I don't know how to explain it.. Just express your love. It hurts, it hurts! But yeah, Takeya-san has a point too. Huh, you're telling me to confess? Besides, you don't want to regret not having the chance to say it, Ebisuzawa-san. Fight for it, Kurumi! Don't act so friendly towards me, Yuki. Excuse me. Teacher, can you come to the roof top later? I want you to check on the vegetables. Okay, I'll be there soon! Who was that? Isn't she also a third year student? Wakasa Yuuri-san. She's president of the horticulture club. Oh I see. So you're their supervisor! Anyways, be brave! Do your best! Thank you! I'll stop by the club on my way out! I should go home as well! I need to take a shower. Good bye, Megu-nee! Hey... Oh no! Okay! Sorry I'm late.. It's okay! Let's eat. Yuki-chan, you can also help. Okay! (Good morning!) Good morning! Take that one. You really became like a mother to all of us, Rii-san! What are you talking about? The thing is, she's the president. Besides, you act like a child, Yuki. What about you, Kurumi-chan? Also, why do we have to make our own food? Shut up! This includes the essence of the School-Living club! For example, farming on the roof.. and honing my cooking skills. I'll call Megu-nee! Hey, listen to me! (Megu-nee's Office) Megu-nee, It's time to eat. Thank you, Yuki-chan. Hey, let's go then. Good morning, Megu-nee! Good morning. Come on, let's have a nice day! Yeah! Alright then. Thanks for the meal! We should eat delicious snacks everyday! You have to eat meat too. The only thing she eats are snacks. Let's eat onions! Onions..? Oh, I think it's harvest time. Okay then, today's club activity is gardening! Hurray! Oh, wow! The vegetables are growing nicely! This school is great, huh! There is electricity, water, and gardening! There is a music room, library, and broadcast room! and lots of manga! And the reason we can use it all is because we are members of the School-Living Club. Right! There are many rules that must be obeyed when living together. Hey! Just one! Right, Megu-nee? Will you listen to the president and vice-president? Yeah, I'll listen! Then I'll allow it. Hurray! Megu-nee, you spoil her too much. Yuki, come on down! Okay! Sara-chan! - Doing well today? - Yes! Now that we are living together here! Living together? Anyways, you're back from your club's activities, right? Yeah, It's called the School-Living Club. It's really fun! Yuki, what is that? This? It's an onion! Wow, that doesn't even look like an onion! We planted it on the roof! The only people who can go up there are the horticulture club and us. It's good, isn't it? Let's go, Yuki. Okay! (School-Living Club) We will go down from here to the first floor. We have to go through this hallway to get to the northern cafeteria. It's dangerous. Are we really going there? So what? I'm afraid, but I'm also hungry. Where is Yuki? She is studying with Megu-nee. Okay, now's our chance. Rii-san, they can't be beaten if we don't deal a lethal blow. They don't feel pain. However, avoid interaction as much as possible, with this. Do you understand? You must remember all of this. For the test. So don't fall asleep! Don't worry, they're already trapped. Okay. How long do we have to continue like this? I thought the special forces would be here by now. This is where it gets more difficult. Let's go. Kurumi! Rii-san! Are you okay?! Thank you, Kurumi. (Popular Menu) (Lunch Special) Thank God. Looks like there's none here. They must have been trapped here. Kurumi, Kurumi! Let me go! What's going on? Okay, no injuries! Don't worry, she isn't infected. I'm sorry for having to do that. Are you a second year? I'm Naoki Miki from class 2-B. Miki? Mii-kun! We're third year students! This is our president, her name is Rii-san! She is Kurumi-chan! My name is Yuki! And finally, this is our teacher, Megu-nee! That's all the members from the School-Living Club! It's not Megu-nee, it's Ms. Sakura. - Nice to meet you! - School-Living Club? This is a club where we live at school and do activities. Yes, yes, yes! The purpose of the School-Living Club, is to participate in club activities with enthusiasm, and set a good example for other students! This is our mascot, Guuma-chan! Since when has he been our mascot? Come to me if you have any further questions. You did great, surviving in there alone. Yuki, sorry but can you help find her a new sports uniform? Roger! Let's go. On the north side, did anyone else survive? In the beginning, we were just at the cafeteria. On the south side, it's perfectly safe. I'm Sorry. You must be tired, right? There's a place to rest over there. Please, rest for awhile. Spaghetti!!! Yuki-chan's favorite! Sit down. The seasoning is just pepper. Thanks for the meal! Don't be that aggressive with your food. It's fine, we're celebrating to welcome in our new member. Huh? Right. We have to work together, and strive with happy hearts! How is it? It's delicious.. Come on, eat with gratitude like her. Huh? Delicious. What-?! They're all working hard in the sports club! It's a nice view, isn't it? Not only can you go on the roof, but you can also use the music room and library. You can use them when you are part of the School-Living Club! Oh, I never said I was joining your club. Come, come! Broadcast room! However, they said we shouldn't make loud sounds. Anyways, you can't go anywhere other than the places I mentioned. Because of the barricade, right? Nori-chan! Right now, I'm just showing my junior around. She is Naoki Miki-san! Yes, she's a member of our new club! Yes, she said she's a second year student! (Megu-Nee's Office) Yuki-chan immediately took the role of Miki's guide. She must be happy because she has a junior. Will she be okay if she continues acting like this? If you're worried about Yuki.. Then, I'll watch over her too. Please do, Megu-nee. Why is it acting like that? Maybe they retain the memories of their previous life. Where is Yuki? She is studying... alone. I see... Why is she like that? In Yuki's memory, the incident never happened. What? The school is peaceful. All the students and teachers are still alive. At first, she just acted like this sometimes. But lately, she's constantly like this... She doesn't accept reality? Doesn't this seem unnatural? Maybe she's acting like a kid... because she was childish to begin with. Do me a favor... Can you play along with her for now? Pretend there are still teachers and students here. What are you doing? Don't act like you can do whatever you want! For example, traveling alone. Or looking through our things. It's useless if we keep locked up here! They're also around the school! So you want to dive into a sea of monsters? Surely more people have survived! I told you, we'll remain here until reinforcements come! What if we keep waiting and help doesn't come? I thought about that too. However...our cellphones or television don't connect, and there is no electricity in the city. Since we don't know the extent of this incident, It's dangerous to roam outdoors! It's dangerous here too! Let's go together! We can't bring Yuki out at this time. Then we just have to leave her. Huh? If she will only be a hinderance, - It's better to leave her. - Come over here. Did you hear? We survive because we work together! If we're alone, how can we do anything?! I have lived through all of this alone. Therefore, I don't care about being alone. Let's go elsewhere. Megu-nee? Don't worry about them. They should stop soon. Because everyone has arguments, right? There's still food here, and the solar panels and water purification devices are still functional. If we expand the barricades, then the range of our room we can access will get bigger. However, someday the food will run out. Nevermind, you're out of the club! Kurumi! I have faced many difficulties too! You have no idea what I went through in that cafeteria! I don't think you do, staying here with your neat uniforms and beautiful hair! It took us a long time before we were able to relax. On the day of the incident... I'm a horticulture club member, on the roof with my tutor Megu-nee. At that time... there was chaos below. What's happening? When I looked inside of the school, I saw something horrible had happened. Kurumi! Run away! Kurumi! Did you get bitten?! What is this, what's going on? All I know is it's bad if you're bitten. You will get infected if you're bitten! Impossible.. Kurumi! Sayaka, what's going on here? What about the others? Are you bitten? Watch out! We are going somewhere safe! Let's find a place to hide, Sayaka! Sorry. I'm kind of... Hold on, stand up! Kurumi! Senpai! I don't know what happened, outside this school, or even the city. At that time, Yuki-chan was there with the other students, Bitten and bitten, everything is strange! without knowing what happened below. Takeya-san, please stay calm! - Are you okay? - Are you okay? Teacher! Are you hurt, are you okay?! Hey, don't go down there! Wait, everyone come back! Move this! Open up! The students who left the roof were all infected. Only we remained. After that... Hold on, senpai! Get away from him, hurry up! Senpai! The rest of us made barricades to survive. However, Yuki-chan fell into depression. So she went crazy? To cheer us up, Megu-nee formed this club. Who wants to join the School-Living Club? What? School-Living? Yes, it's the name of the club! We will all stay at school. A club? We will sleep here everyday, and cook food ourselves. And do a lot of club activities. Club..? Sounds fun, right? Megu-nee thought that it might be some time before we could have a pleasant life. The current Yuki might look like a crazy girl, but that cheerfulness saved us. Are you just trying to look away?! Are you just going to wait for your turn?! Food is low. And you won't leave. You two act happy, and the other one is crazy. So what if you have a pleasant day? What's the benefit?! (Bedroom) Are you just going to wait for your turn?! What?! The Broadcast Room? Mii-kun! What are you doing here?! You're not leaving the school, are you? Yes, just go back to the building! No way, I don't want you to leave! Come back to the school! School doesn't exist anymore! Huh? Can you stop doing that? Pretending that the students are still here, pretending to go to class! What are you talking about..? There's no way that it was Miki-chan, right? Oh no, they're coming! If they're gathered here, don't tell me... Which car is it? Oh no! Let's go back to the others.. Get down! Rii-san, stay here. Up there! Are they school people? What is this?! Stop it! - Kei! - Miki! Help me, Miki! No, no! Mii-kun... You two, run to the building! Hurry! Sports Week! That's right, Yuki! You both have to get to the finish line because you're one team! Come on, Mii-kun! Begin! You can do it! Just a bit more! Come on, come on!! Hurry up! Thank God you're all fine. You have done well. Although we managed to come out unscathed, it didn't solve the problem. I know. However, I think this club is very important to everyone. Yes. We will continue moving forward! Miki is still moping.. Should we cheer her up? Leave her alone for awhile. The more we try to help, the more annoyed she will become. Oh, I see.. You are really smart, Rii-san! What about Yuki? Oh, no... The purpose of the School-Living Club is to help each other, and to live a fun school life! Senpai, how can you talk so cheerfully? I know, that Rii-san and the others.. are sometimes secretly arguing, and hiding their true feelings. So, I guess the only thing I can do is make others cheerful. Join the School-Living Club, Mii-kun. Stop calling me Mii-kun. Let me say it... Come on, Mii-kun! If we get through this, we can head to the spare room for disaster prevention. I've seen you fight them in the parking lot. Because before, when I was alone, It was difficult. So the point is... Together, we can do this! I'm beginning to understand what Yuuri-senpai was talking about yesterday. I mean, how you were saved by Yuki. Therefore, I'm going to do my best here. Then, welcome to the School-Living Club! Behind you! Kei... Help me, Miki! Senpai, you are amazing. You can attack them like it's nothing. I can still fight if it's a student I don't know. However, if I have to fight someone I know or my friend... Maybe it's because we see their eyes. It's better not to look into their eyes. You are strong, senpai. The thing is, even if it's your crush... Sorry. I heard about it from Rii-san. It's okay. Alright, all we have to do now is move the bodies. Ta-da! This room is full of food and medicine for all our daily needs! Our school has great management. Looks like we'll be set for the next few months. Hey, look at this. Canned bread! I want this one! Huh? that's cheating! There's more, really. This one is mine! It hurts, it hurts! You guys, there's plenty more. I'll push it! That's too much for you! We'll use the ladders to remove some. Oh, don't worry. At least let Miki help you. Huh? What do you think, Megu-nee? Hmm, alright. You can do it yourself, but please be careful! Okay, Megu-nee! Megu-nee spoils her too much. Yuki-senpai, let's push it together! Okay! Are you ready? I'm sorry... It seems like Yuki is acting more and more like a kid, huh? I don't see the problem. What's important is that she gets along with Miki. Yeah, but is it okay if we keep this up? It seems we have to ration the food... Are you okay?! You're not bitten, are you? I'm fine, thanks. Are there any others? Sorry, I let my guard down. Don't go down there! Senpai! Kurumi... Get away from me... I don't want to! I lied to you...about...one thing... Actually, I've always been interested in you. The reason why I joined the club.... is because I wanted to see you. Senpai, hang on senpai! Get away from him, hurry up! Me too... I still can't express my true feelings. I don't think I'll ever be able to. You shouldn't be scared to occasionally show your weak side, Kurumi. I'm fine, I'm fine... Even though I... Hey, hey, hey! Take a look! What? Mii-kun found this! We can take photos with this! Amazing, right? I'm sure they understand how it works. Mii-kun, you are very smart, huh! Oh come on, Yuki-senpai! Yeah, yeah. Stop saying that. Okay, I'll take a picture! Mii-kun, you're good at posing in front of the camera, huh? No, I'm not! Yes you are! Say no! Yeah, I'm right! Let me take a photo of you, Yuki-senpai. Okay, come on! Hey, Kurumi-chan! Come on Rii-san, you do it too. I'd rather not! What are you talking about?! Rii-san, pose! You're so pretty! Let's use the countdown for a group photo! Wait, I'll call Megu-nee first. Hurry up, Yuki! Look Yuki-chan, mackerel! Woah, mackerel! Hey!!! Look at that one! Wow, one just shined! It's autumn already. Let's hold a school festival! Do you mean the cultural festival? Yes, if it's autumn, then it's time for the school festival! Wait a minute, We have to maintain the school tradition.. Right? Then, what do you want to do? Well... Miki, what do you think? Fortune telling? I like fortune telling! Okay, it's decided! Let's go! Hurray! It will definitely be fun! We can also design the fortune-telling equipment, right? Of course! Yuki-chan, do you think we need permission from the supervisor? Supervisor? Megu-nee. Oh yes, I will ask her first. It's okay, let me do it. Hey, Megu-nee. Yuki-chan seems to be fine without you constantly by her side. Maybe the situation has gradually improved. Miki-chan has also been getting along with members of the School-Living Club. With Kurumi, she helped make our place more secure. Kurumi is still the same as always. However, sometimes she still thinks about her senpai. Maybe that's what makes me worried. How about the president? Is the president doing well? Me? I'm fine. Even though I'm scared and confused about what to do.. Regarding what will happen to us, in the future... You each have your own strengths that complement one another. Therefore, If you work together, there is nothing to be afraid of. That's true. Alright! Look, the night is beautiful! The city is shining! Yup. I want it to stay like this forever. I don't think I want to graduate. We'll have to do it eventually. Suppose we survi...I mean, what do you want to do after you graduate? Go to study or work? I want to go to college. I've always admired college girls. I want to major in sports. I want to be an athlete in the future. Surely you can become an athlete! What about you, Miki-chan? I want to continue studying. Let's go to university together, then! Let's become college students together, and stop by Megu's place! Megu-nee! Long time, no see! Woah, you guys are more mature, huh! You're looking good, as usual! We'll become college students, huh? Yes, and then we'll become adults. We will be all grown up. Well, let's always be friends, okay? Of course! We haven't arrived yet. Don't open your eyes. Okay, okay. Okay, we're here! Ta-da! Wow! This is really good! Welcome to the ''School-Live'' fortune-telling booth! Let's celebrate the school festival as members of the School-Living Club! Cheers! Hey, hey! Let's reach out! Go, School-Living Club! Huh? Oh, come on... We're not idols. It's ridiculous. Naoki Miki-san, your future will shine. What is the light like? It just shines, okay! You already said that. What about me, Yuki-chan? The president's future, yes... You will become a beautiful wife! Oh really?! Yes! That sounds like a lie. Megu-nee's future is to always be our tutor! Okay! That's like an agreement to be a slave. Ebisuzawa-san, you don't have a future! Hey! What, the fire alarm? They're probably gathering into the school building. Maybe the smoke is from the first floor.. Yuki-chan, don't split up. They're reacting to the alarm.. Yuki, you have to go back to the club room. Kurumi! Rii-san, fall back! Miki! Megu-nee! Yuki, don't just stand there! Run away! Through the north building to the club room, hurry! Yuki-chan, we must run! Kurumi, Yuki-chan! There's too many! Senpai! This is impossible, we need help! We can still head to the north building! They're here too! We need to rush through to get to the stairs! Megu-nee, where are you? The club room! Come on. Why? Why does it have to end like this?! Why?! Senpai! Was this all for nothing?! Miki-chan. If you are alone, you can definitely escape right? Now, while you still have time.. Just leave me. How could I leave my senpai? I won't do that. Ready? Lift! We... ...have fought well. Right, guys? Megu-nee... Senpai... What's wrong, Kurumi? Senpai... I've made it this far... However...I think this is the furthest I can go. What are you talking about? Because it's impossible. I... I had fallen in love with you, because you have nerves of steel. For example, when you fall, you never complain. Senpai? I also... have always loved you, senpai. I guess that means, we feel the same. I was finally able to say it. That's enough for me... You can't do that. You must keep living, Kurumi. Don't give up! You've always gotten up, despite falling. Thank you, senpai. I will... never give up! It can't be... Miki! I'm okay. Senpai! Thank God! Where's Yuki? Weren't you with her? No way... She must still be alive. Because she's with Megu-nee. Megu-nee? Guys? Yuki-chan. Over here. Wait. Hurry and take anything that looks useful! Pain killers. First Aid kit. This too! Everyone, get away! - Megu-nee, are you alright? - Megu-nee! Yuki, where are you?! Megu-nee! Hey, I heard that from... No! You understand, right? I cannot be saved. Listen to me, Yuki-chan. I want you to never give up! Rii-san, I leave you in charge of the others. I beg you, president. Kurumi, you must protect them, okay? You can do it, Kurumi! I trust in you! You guys... I'm so happy I got to be your teacher. Megu-nee! No, Megu-nee! Megu-nee! Please don't do this! Yuki, get away from her! It's okay. Megu-nee... She did that, so she wouldn't hurt anyone... You can rest now, Megu-nee. The warehouse, the roof, everything was invaded. The electricity and water supplies have also been destroyed. But, thank God they were all burned as well. Ah, It's good to be in the club room again! Look, the sun is beautiful! Guuma-chan, I found the thing you lost. Done! Oh, this is a mess.. You're going to be scolded by Megu-nee! Senpai... Yuki-chan. I have to clean it, I must clean it! Yuki-chan! I understand... I understand all of it! I understand that the school is gone, and also the fact that Megu-nee has been gone for a long time. I'm sorry for being a burden all this time. That's not true. However, I... I was able to survive because of you guys. Maybe, it's time for our graduation. Maybe, it's time we get out of this school. Let's do a graduation ceremony! Saying thanks to Megu-nee and to the school. Because we all passed! I agree! Go, School-Living Club! Megu-nee. Soon, we are going to graduate. Yes, congratulations. Therefore... this is our last assignment. Thank you, for being by our side all this time. Please watch over, our graduation ceremony. (Bible) Now, Megurigaoka High School, will hold a graduation ceremony. Stand up! Bow. Now the opening words. All of us... ...today will graduate from Megurigaoka's private high school. Every day that has passed.. ..evokes memories of the past. But, today will be our last memory... ..at this school.. that we love so much. We say many thanks.. ..that we can live everyday.. ..with our friends in the School-Living Club. All together, on this irreplaceable graduation day. Having already said that, Please, take a seat. Furthermore, let the granting of the graduation certificates begin! Takeya Yuki. Yes. â™ª We are deeply indebted to you, our honorable teachers â™ª Congratulations. Thank you. Naoki Miki.

Thank you very much! Good bye, senpai. Is this Ms. Sakura's car, right? Yup. If it's an emergency, we can use it. You can drive, Kurumi-chan? Megu-nee taught me, so yes. If that's all, then let's go! We're off! Kurumi, in front of you! Pay attention! Yeah, I know! So now where are we going? Temporarily... ...how about we check out the university? University? Because this is a new school year, right? Yeah, I guess so. Maybe someone out there survived besides us. That's true! Well, then it's already decided! Ya hoo!
