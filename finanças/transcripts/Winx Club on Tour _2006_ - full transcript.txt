The whole Magic Dimension is one big playground for them. They do not deserve to be in this school. Oh, Griselda, they're still so young and have much to learn. A big test is coming their way. A very important mission. Detention is what they should get! They're always sitting around doing nothing. Also hanging around with those boys... That has to be controlled. Their mission has to be accomplished. And it will be accomplished. Never did the Magic Dimension have such amazing fairies. The only thing they care about is how they look. They spend more time on their hair than on their studies! They think they can fix everything with their powers. This mission will a great opportunity to bring their skills to the test. They haven't mastered their magic abilities to the fullest yet. Only true determined fairies can unravel the mysteries of the Magic Dimension. There is great danger. The Winx have to be ready. I wonder what this assignment will be. It sounds important. Everything is important, Bloom. The whole Magic Dimension is in danger. Probably there are shadow monsters lurking around the corner. It's never peace and quiet around here. What did you say, Tecna? I say it's never peace and quiet around here, Musa! Did your closet explode, Stella? So funny, Tecna. Maybe I could borrow yours? Lots of empty space. There we go again. My Floralia Anicala can't stand these quarrels. They'll lose their buds. Oh, we don't have time for this. Our class starts soon. Yay! But I have nothing to wear! And I certainly don't have time for class. I gotta go to Magix... to shop! I saw so many beautiful stuff, Brandon will love it! Sky hasn't called me yet! Boys never think about this sort of stuff. Be happy that you even got a boyfriend, Bloom. They have stuff to do, too. We're not the only ones with these assignments. Dragon controlling isn't easy. You only think about yourself. I don't understand why we always get all these assignments, Layla. I mean, aren't we already perfect? Can't improve perfection. Not perfection, but YOU need all these classes and assignments. There's always danger around the corner, and of course always the Trix. Haven't seen them in quite a while... the Trix. Would they still be in Oblivion? Who? The Trix! I don't care where they are. The only thing I know is; the life of a fairy isn't easy. Life of a fairy isn't easy.

Are you all friends of the Winx? How disgusting... Oh, I see some boys too. We came to see what those girls are up to again. They think they're the boss around here. Well, they're wrong, sisters.

I hope it's not something that involves us. It would be very ugly... ... For you... ... Not for us. Time to talk... Or don't you wanna tell us? Magic transformation, now! What a boring magic trick. Come on, we don't have all day. I don't know what you're talking about. Really? 'Cause I don't believe it. You should come with us, maybe then you'll talk, right, Darcy...? So that was easy. Without that little club, she can't do anything! Where is Flora? She's almost never late. This is her favorite class. I'm sure she is just switching outfits. Maybe she wasn't feeling well. She's probably finishing her homework. Always working on getting A's. I'm gonna check. Girls, are you ready for your assignment? Where is Flora? It looks like the witches are trying to steal the magical essences from all the planets. Because of that, the harmony and balance of the Magic Dimension shall be destroyed. This has happended before, a long time ago. And now, the Trix have found the old spells of the ancestral witches. It is up to you to make sure history doesn't repeat itself. There is only one way to them: It is the Magic Circle. You'll have to find the Magic Circle to save the Magic Dimension. The Pixies can't help you, neither can your Charmix. New dangers requires new magical abilities. With this assignment, you'll have to find the core of your own powers. Are there any questions? I wish you good luck with this mission. What are magic essences? Let me look it up in my database. "Magic essences: fundamental energies..." "... Found within the planetary cores, for the magical arts". Yes! I got it now... I think it means that it's what makes a planet a planet. The most important part of that planet. Without that, it's not the same planet. It would be missing its core. Its essence! Definitely something for the Trix. For the Winx, you mean. The fate of the Magic Dimension is in our hands again. How are we even supposed to find the Magic Circle? The core of our own power? What even is the core of my power? Mine is light, brightness. We should go to Red Fountain. I bet Brandon knows where the Magic Circle is. I'll ask Sky. He has probably been to the Magic Circle. He's been almost everywhere. It's probably not that simple. We should analyse the assignment. If I combine my interdimensional database with Timmy's- Girls! I don't think going to Red Fountain is part of our assignment. We have to go to the core of our own powers, not Red Fountain. But the whole Magic Dimension is in danger. We have no time to waste. No Pixies, no Charmix... But miss Faragonda said nothing about the Specialists. Come on, we have to go. We can't go without Flora. You're right. I'll call her. Uh, voicemail. We'll have to wait here for her. But we can't wait, this is way too important. Dear, what if you wait here for Flora? Then we'll go to Red Fountain. I'll wait. You guys go. There's nobody there I want to see anyway. ♪ Alone, always alone, Is there someone, just for me ♪ ♪ Where is the one 'Cause you feel so alone ♪ ♪ Without the one, always alone Where is that one in my life? ♪ ♪ Always alone without the one Who gives me his heart and makes me float ♪ ♪ One and one becomes two When will I experience that? ♪ ♪ Where is the one for me, Or will I always be like this, so alone ♪ ♪ Hey don't be sad, you're not alone We're a team, listen, we got you ♪ ♪ We'll find a boyfriend in no time, It'll be all right ♪ ♪ But you gotta do something, be your own fate ♪ ♪ Staying here, that's not okay, It's not that sad, I've got an idea ♪ ♪ Come with me, come with me, come with me ♪ ♪ No use in staying here, you gotta get out, just listen to your girlfriend ♪ ♪ So many nice guys out there, but you have to go outside ♪ ♪ Or else you could miss a boyfriend! ♪ ♪ To the movies, to the beach, a romantic dinner ♪ ♪ Before you know it, you'll got your one! ♪ ♪ Come with me, come with me, come with me ♪ ♪ Friend wanted for a nice fairy, Nice plans for the two of you ♪ ♪ That's what everyone wants, Just come, don't stay all alone ♪ There are lots of cute guys in Red Fountain. Let's go! The Winx are heading to Red Fountain, the school of their boyfriends: The Specialists. Magic knights are trained here to fight against evil. They're brave, strong and smart. You can always count on them. ♪ Here we are, the Specialists We protect every living being ♪ ♪ You can always count on us Yes, we're ready for you ♪ Get ready, get ready for the beat, get ready Get ready, get ready, get ready for the beat Sky! Come on, keep up. He fights like a girl. Like a fairy or a witch, Brandy? It's a compliment. Look at the Winx! Well, we're called Specialists for a reason, Helia. When the time comes, it's always the same ones who have to fix the problem. That's us! ♪ Here we are, the Specialists We protect every living being ♪ ♪ You can always count on us Yes, we're ready for you ♪ Get ready, get ready for the beat, get ready Get ready, get ready, get ready for the beat Everything okay? Stella! What are you doing here? You're not allowed here. If Saladdin sees you... I'm happy to see you too, Brandon. We didn't come here to catch up. No, of course not. The Magic Dimension is probably in danger again. It is, Brandon. Really? Where is Flora? Did something happen? And Musa? They're coming, Riven. This couldn't wait. What's wrong? Tell us, and we'll take care of it. We got an assignment from Faragonda. We have to find the Magic Circle... ... to prevent the Trix from stealing all the magic essences from every planet. If that happens, the magical harmony and balance... ... That keeps the Magical Dimension intact will vanish! Oh, and I thought something serious happened. Seriously! Brandon, this has happened before with the ancestral witches, and now the Trix have found the ancestral witches' spells. The Magic Circle is the only thing that can prevent the Trix... ... From stealing all the essences from all the planets! See, I do pay attention. Musa! Did Flora come with you? No, we haven't seen her yet, Helia. I have no idea where she is. So these essences contain important magic, and the Magic Circle... That doesn't sound that difficult. Do you know where the Magic Circle is, Riven? No, but how hard can it be? It's magic, and it's round. But of course! My sword ring. How didn't I think of that. Look, it contains magic, and it's round! And a little too easy, Stella. If it was that easy, miss Faragonda wouldn't give us this assignment. Wait a minute, if this has happened before, does Faragonda know where this Magic Circle is? We have to find it ourselves. It has something to do with the core of our own powers. We've localized Flora! We know where she is! It looks like the Trix have taken Flora to the Shadow Castle! I have enough with those Trix. We have to go to the Shadow Castle. I know the way. Need any help, ladies? No, thanks, Brandon. We can handle those Trix ourselves. I'm coming with you! - Helia, wait. Don't worry. It will be alright. Magic Winx! Meanwhile, in the Shadow Castle, the Trix keep Flora inprisoned in a force field. They're about to execute their evil plans... Hey! You awake, fairy? Fairies smell so bad. It's about time you'll tell us what you guys are up to. Let me out! You would like that, huh... Tell us what you know and we'll consider. What am I supposed to tell you? I don't know anything. Do you really think we believe that? Aren't you the smartest of the bunch? Yes I am, and that's why I know the Winx will be right here to save me. And then you'll see what happens to you. How cute. The more, the merrier. This takes too long. We have other important stuff to do, and that won't be interrupted by a little Winx fairy. We have to hurry. The other girls will soon be here, and we don't want that right now. We have to start now. Stormy, where is the Forgotten Book? Oops, forgot. Just kidding! QUIET! And what will we do with her? She is staying here. Like the three ancestral witches have done before, we'll also rule over this Dimension. Yes! Yes! The Magic Essences are ours. Open the portal to all the planets! NO! NO! The Winx have found their way into the Shadow Castle. But will they also find Flora? It's this way! My database says Flora is somewhere deep inside the castle. All this negative energy around here disrupts my gadgets, though. Darkar! Could he still be here? I hate this place. Be quiet! I hear something. Someone is coming! This way! It's so scary! Flora should be really close. There's nothing here. Tecna! - Flora! You found me! Flora, are you alright!? Where are they? Gone! They went trough a portal to steal magic essences. They'll be just as powerful as those ancestral witches. Magic essences? Then the Dimension is now in danger! And if we don't find the Magic Circle... - Magic essences? Magic Circle? What is that? We would like to know that, too! Especially about how we can find that Magic Circle! Faragonda has warned us it's the only way to stop this evil plan of them. What if the Trix have already gathered all the essences? What do we do then? Girls, I'd like so much to stay here and chat, but if the Trix are already gone, shoudn't we do so? Uhm, hello! How do I get out of here? Maybe a technological spell? I can try. There is a very dark spell on this! Come on, they might come back! A Magic Circle... A closed, round line, as counteforce, a circle of power... I got an idea! I knew we could count on you! Flora knows where the Magic Circle is! Too late... Winx! Are you here to get your lost fairy? I don't think so. I do! And you're going back to Oblivion, where you belong! No way, fairy. Magic Winx! Why aren't we able to fly? I can't transform! I can't help you! Stella, watch out! Golden pollen! Bloom! I can't move! My make-up! - Oh, Stella! - Oh, Stella! We can't do anything. They're too strong! It's because of the essences! We're too late! We can't do this without the Magic Circle! We have to go! What about Flora! Girls, you can't save me if they trap you too! Go, run! We have to go now! Musa! Tired already? Is it past your bedtime? What about your friend Flora? Just wait till we find that Magic Circle! Wait a minute, tuneless fairy, what did you say? Something about a Magic Circle? Some cute plan again? Get out of my way with your hurricane hair! Did your hair dryer explode? Well, well, well. Weren't you trying to escape? There is the exit! Well, it was very nice having you! Going back to your boyfriend? Or your lipgloss! Hold on Flora. We'll be back! Bye, Flora. ♪ Look, there go the Winx, zero energy ♪ ♪ No power, the end, what a flop ♪ ♪ Forget that weak team ♪ ♪ One power reigns, that's the Trix ♪ The Trix have stolen all the magic essences of all the planets. The whole Dimension is in danger, even Alfea is in a critic situation. Oh, what a mess! Look what happened. This happened because the magic essence of Magix dissapeared! This is terrible. Those essences have to get back to where they belong. How will I ever sleep like this. You should be happy you still got a bed. Stella, what happened? Well, there is a hurricane trapped in my room. Forever. Girls. I have really bad news... Now that the witches have gotten all the magic essences... And Flora! And Flora, they are all now in big danger. The balance is gone, and that has big consequences. Everything is changing. You have to find the Magic Circle now to save Flora and the whole Magic Dimension. The Trix have to be stopped. Your own home planets are in big danger. We're getting emergency calls from Solaris... And Melody... From Andros too. The professors are doing everything they can. But time is running out... Winx... The entire Magic Dimension is counting on you! And don't forget, you're Flora's only hope. What a disaster. How do you think earth is doing? In Gardenia... My parents... The entire Dimension is counting on us, Bloom. Is there no one else they could find? We got a W! We got an I! We got a N! We got a X! We got...! - Nothing! We got nothing! The Trix crushed us... Our powers aren't strong enough. Especially not with Flora. Where is Flora!? Do the witches still keep her inprisoned? I'm assuming it didn't go so well then... Sky, it's terrible. We coudn't do anything. We had a feeling something happened. Magix changed in a blink of an eye. The Trix stole the magic essences. They've become so strong... Too strong for us! It's one big mess. And if we don't find that Magic Circle, then the Magic Dimension will never be the same. And Flora, and us too. I think you can use our help. We should go to the Shadow Castle. And then what? I want to help Flora too, but not this way. There has to be something that we can do... Aren't we optimists? Specialists, optimists. We'll continue tomorrow. We're gonna find that Magic Circle.

There has to be something here that could tell us more about the Magic Circle. I'm sure Flora knows the solution. She knows a lot about magic. What did you say she wanted to tell us back there? How do you think she's holding up? All alone in that scary castle... And those creepy Trix. How awful! And all that humidity is so bad for your hair... Don't you wanna help her? Keep searching! The library's searching system! We just have to ask for the right book. All right. The Magic Circle. Girls! Girls, help! Here! "Since the beginning of time, the Magic Circle is the source of the Magic Dimension." We have to find the source! Oh, no, not to the Black Mud-Swamp, right? Maybe on the bottom of lake Raccaluce! Do you think Daphne knows something? Maybe the fountain in Magix city! We could go shopping. - Stella! Well, my solution would be shopping. I've found it! "The Magic Circle is in the heart of the Magic Dimension." We should head over there! Head over where? The heart of the Magic Dimension! Midpoint, in the center. I know! But where is that? Here in Magix? The intergalactic map! It has to be pointed out somewhere in here. Let me log in. Geographically, the midpoint of the Magic Dimension... ... Should be on the intersection of the planet Meridiana. There! That planet! There is where we should go then! How would the weather be there? And what should I wear? I have to go shop- I'm sure I have something in my closet. How are we going to get there? Teleportation with my scepter, of course. Well, looking at what happened last time, I don't think that's the best idea. What does she mean? It didn't go as planned, we were supposed - Yeah, yeah, it wasn't that bad. If you got a better plan... The Specialists, we'll go with the Hawk. I'll contact Timmy. The girls are heading to the midpoint of the Magic Dimension, along with the Specialists. Will they find the Magic Circle there? It was so beautiful last time I was here. What happened? There's a change in the planetary status, that has something to do with the magic essence of this planet. The Trix did this thoroughly. Timmy, do you know where the Magic Circle is? Where do we go? I have combined my data with Tecna's... But I found nothing yet. Where are the girls? We have to hurry. Flora is still in danger. Anyone know what were even looking for? What does the Magic Circle even look like? Well duh, round! Ha-ha very funny. Where are you? Hello? Over here! Have you found anything yet? This planet is so big. We've been walking for hours already. Are you okay, Stella? Ugh, it's so dirty here! My look is ruined. These expeditions are definitely not meant for the fairy of beauty. Just look at my shoes! We're going to find the circle. But we don't even know how it looks like. It's not gonna happen. Come on Musa, we have to. You never give up. You are a fairy; determined and brave. Only with a correct analyses we can come to a correct decision. Fantastic Tecna! You always have everything under control. Wow, that's a good compliment. You never say such things to me. No, but I mean it. Just like that. But different, of course! You know what I mean. No, I don't, actually. You can tell me what you feel for me. But that's not always easy. Helia, what's wrong?

Without Pixies, Charmix, to the source of your power... and then? The heart! We have to tell the others. Bloom, wait! It's the middle of the night. Let them rest. We'll tell them tomorrow morning.

I'm telling you nothing! No, of course you're not. But with a truth serum I'm sure you'll change your mind. Always comes in handy. Well...? The Winx are searching for a Magic Circle to stop us. And that's not what we want. Tell us what you know about this Magic Circle. We have to find it be- A circle of power has to formed from the heart of the Magic Dimension. What did she say exactly? Something about a circle of power... And the heart of the Magic Dimension! Oh! The heart of the Magic Dimension. Is that what you said, fairy? Well?! Yes. So... those fairies want to form a Magic Circle... ... From the heart of the Magic Dimension... What a magic hassle! Typical Winx, so it has to be true. Last question, Flora... Where is the heart of the Magic Dimension? The heart of the Magic Dimension lies in your own heart. That is the source of your power. I'm sorry girls... That circle! It's just them forming a circle! We just have to form a circle. That shouldn't be that hard. And we have the magic essences! Superpower! It will be the most powerful circle- BE QUIET! You don't have a heart... So, those fairies want to form a circle to stop us. But they need her for that. Otherwise the circle won't be round. So we positively need to get out of here! And we'll take you with us! We'll go trough the portal. No time to waste. The Winx have to hurry. The Trix now know the secret behind the Magic Circle, but the Winx have not figured it out yet. What now? I still have to shower. Bloom had a dream about Daphne. And she said we would find the Magic Circle in the heart of the Magic Dimension. But we should not look outside ourselves. What? That's what Bloom said; Don't look outside you for the Magic Circle. The heart...? Oh that's it! The heart of the Magic Dimension is the source of our power! The heart... The source... Our own hearts! Is that it? What about the circle? Wait, Flora knew. A Magic Circle... A round, closed line full of power. Simple tecnomagic. Simple? Why didn't you come with this back then? Okay, a closed round line full of power... But of course! I've got it! WE! We are the Magic Circle! But, are we able to do this without Flora? We have to save her first. Oh, how are we supposed to win from the Trix. They are so strong! They have become so strong because of those magic essences. And so dangerous! Are you afraid of those "Superstorms, superspells"!? But they are strong. We need help. The Specialists. Yes. Sky! And Brandon, Riven, Timmy and Helia. But don't we need a lot more help? We do! Look, we have to make sure we bundle our power. The more power we got, the stronger the circle gets! First we have to save Flora, and then we'll make that supercircle. Oh, so everyone has to join us! Oh, hey! Do you wanna help us?
