I've also got one about werewolves. - Ugh. - What? - Werewolves. Yeah. Scary, right? No. Trodden. - How is it trodden? - Let me do it. Oh. You need kindling. Yeah. I know. Werewolves are tough. You've got "An American Werewolf in London," and then you've got everything else, which is what? Uh, "Silver Bullet?" I think "Silver Bullet's" good. "Silver Bullet" is childish, campy garbage. - Ouch. - Whoo! Nice job, me. So, what's the werewolf tale? Well, it's kind of a revenge story. A werewolf kills a guy's parents.

We're burning moonlight! Okay! Alright, fine. Shit. Okay. So, uh... There's this little boy, Sam, okay, and it's his birthday, and his parents and all his family, they're all gathered around. They're clapping and they're smiling and they're just like, "Aw, what a great little boy. Oh, what an incredible life we're going to give you." It's a little on the nose. "What an incredible life we're gonna give you?"Hey. This is my story. I'm still working it out, okay? Keep going. Okay, so, that night, Sam is tossing and he's turning in bed. Sorry. And It doesn't help that there's, like, a storm -- like a reallybad storm. And he looks outside his bedroom window, and he sees this creepy... crawly... tree. Kind of like the one in Poltergeist. You know, it's like branches all gnarled, and it's banging against the house in the wind, just like... Anyway. So, Sam, he hears this noise downstairs, and it's kind of like... Like a -- Like a... You know, like a weird animal sound. And just down the hallway, his mom and his dad, they hear it, too. And the mom wakes the dad. Like, " Sweetheart, did -- did you hear that? , I think there's someone in the house." "Hey, don't -- don't wake me up." I don't know if the dad's, like, Jewish or -- And the dad's like... I guess I'll go check it out. So... dad, he goes downstairs with a flashlight. Details! Details! Details! Sam's dad, whose name is... Bill and he has a mustache and a comb-over, and he heads downstairs with a flashlight, with a flash-- with a red flashlight, like one you used to have as a kid. That's a detail! Yeah. So... he heads downstairs, and he's -- he's trembling. You know, he's like scared. He's the man of the house, but his, like, heart is like beating fast. He's got a bad heart, and he's just, like, really spooked, and he's trembling. Show me. Show me the shaking. He's like.... "Okay. Doesn't seem to be anything here." - Hey. - Sorry. He's looking for the source of the noise, you know? And then, "Ah! It's just a raccoon. You know how when raccoons stand up and they're all cute on their hind legs, and he's like... And he has a little chuckle He's like," Well, that's definitely not evil." But then he hears something. He turns around. Gasp. What is it, Fred? It's a werewolf, Fanny! It's a big fucking, gasping, gaping 3-feet-wide, 10-feet-tall, inhuman fucking werewolf! And it just, like, smashes through the window like it's nothing! Like it's nothing. I love that. He shines the flashlight in the werewolf's face. And takes his fucking fangs, and he's like... "Please have mercy." And the werewolf's like, "Fuck that. I'm a werewolf." And he doesn't have mercy, and he was like... And blood's just.... So he's dead. But then, little does the werewolf know, mom is standing at the top of the stairs. She saw the whole thing. Oh, my God. Honey. Ohh. Sam! Get in the closet quick! There's a werewolf in the house! And then she goes to Sam. She's like... Everything's gonna be fine, okay? - Okay. - Okay. You get it. So anyway, obviously the werewolf hears all of this, because you know, ah, 'cause -- 'cause he's... half dog or whatever. So he starts lurking up the -- up the stairs. He's lumbering up the stairs? Lumbering up the stairs. Yeah, he starts lumbering up the stairs, like... Like... Show me that lumber! Ooh, breathe like a werewolf. Breathe. ♪♪ Holy fuck. That's fucking scary, dude. See? I can be scary. Apparently. Anyway. So, the werewolf lurks and lumbers and snarls his way up the stairs. Just like.... Just like sniffing the area. You know, searching for his next victim. And then mom distracts him from somewhere in the house. She's like, "I'm in here, you hairy son of a bitch!" I guess she's also kinda Long Island, Jewish sorta thing, too. And he's like, ah. And she grabs a revolver from the shoe box in the closet. How'd you know? How'd you know I'd do -- what? I mean, it's just sort of the obvious next step. Why does it have to be obvious? I -- Look, I'm not nagging you or anything. It's just been done, like, I don't know, 600 or 700 times. Okay. Thanks for your permish. Anyway. She takes a revolver out of the closet, loads it as fast as she can. "Oh, God." She's like... And the werewolf's like... Shoot. Oh, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit. And she loads a bullet into the chamber, and she cocks the hammer.Quick question. A-Are they silver bullets? It really feels like mom knows what she's doing here. You know, was she a cop or something? Yeah. Y-Yeah, good point. Meanwhile, her little boy, he's hiding in the closet just, like, trying not to make a peep, like. Laurie Strode in "Halloween." Exactly. Exactly. Okay. As the werewolf is, like, walking past the closet door. Like... ka-thump. Ka-thump. Ka-thump. Ka-thump, ka-thump. Ka-thump, ka-thump. That's when mom gets in the firing position. "Smile, you son of a bitch!" Very "Jaws."Favorite movie. Then there's just, like, smoke, you know? Did she kill him? No! The werewolf's like... And her neck is just, like, bleeding all over the fucking floor, and she's like... "I love you so much." And she lets out this bloody gar-gargle. Gurgle. She lets out a blood gurgle. And she's like... "Remember when things were better." Bah. So, she's dead. Now it's just Sam hiding in the safety of the closet. Just watching that werewolf. It's getting closer and closer. See, he's getting closer to the the closet door. And Sam's like, "Oh, my fucking God, oh, my God! I'm gonna die." And the werewolf's like... And then... boo! It's the fucking cops! Fucking murder. It's by a werewolf. Fire away. And the cops are descending on the house, and they're just like -- And the werewolf hears this. He's like, ah! Which is werewolf for, "Fuck! I'm outta here!" Ah! Did the werewolf hit his knee or was that just you? That's very funny. That's really funny. Okay, real question -- How'd the cops come? They knew... because mom... she dialed 911 and left the receiver off the hook. So, uh, cops come, little boy gets rescued, werewolf gets away and then what? It's a really good question. That's a really g-good question. Um. Well, I think... Ah. ...Sam grows up, and he becomes kind of like a -- maybe like a bounty hunter hell-bent on getting revenge on his parents' killer. Yeah, I mean, I guess my first question is... Did Sam's family know this werewolf? You know, like, pre -- pre-becoming a werewolf? Was it the neighborhood pervert who was bitten by some lycan and then just came after the family 'cause, like, he secretly likes little boys, like Stanley Tucci? I mean, not that Stanley Tucci likes little boys, but you know, it's kind of like "Lovely Bones," and he played that character, and he was so good. Yeah, no, I don't know. I mean, that's good, but I -- I don't know. I-I'll figure that out. But... - Okay. So, uh... Does Sam get his revenge? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Maybe Sam tracks him down like at a diner. Maybe he's like a creepy mechanic. With his mom's revolver, the gun he's been carrying around for years, and it's loaded with silver bullets. And he walks up to him. He knows who he is. He knows his, like, alter ego, you know? And he's like, "Excuse me... Are you Ben... Franklin?" Sorry, I'm not good with coming up with names. No, I think it's great that the werewolf shares his name with a politician who also discovered electricity. Yeah, I agree. "Are you Ben Franklin?" "What the fuck is it to you, buddy?" And he just, like -- all the rage, all he hears. He's just, like, seeing the..., like, all those years. And he's looking at his eyes, and he looks at him, and he knows. And then... everything goes in slow-motion. Splat. End movie! Cue Huey Lewis! Credits. What if Sam's a girl? Uh... Well, she's not. Because I'm writing from personal experience. Oh, the personal experience of a werewolf killing your entire family? You must hate dogs. Fanny... Too many white guys in action flicks. Come on, John Wick. Pass the Bechdel test. Okay, Sam's a girl. Sam's a girl now. Sam's Samantha. Okay. You happy? Sam is a girl, because I'm a... white dude who's inclusive of all --Inclusive of all genders, conforming and nonconforming, yeah. And hand out a compliment, for Christ's sake, you know. I just made a fool of myself acting my little heart out for you. Your turn, Strasbourg. I'm good. What the hell do you mean, you're good? It was your idea to stay up all night and do this, like... ...scary story theater shit. Come on, act out that "top secret project" you've been talking about. I couldn't possibly do that. What, did you sign, like, an NDA or something? Actually, yes. Huh. All my stuff that's in development is top secret, so... Well, aren't you, uh... cool. Well, you got to tell me some story. I mean, come on. Tell me more about the... woman in the attic. Actually, I've got a story for you. It's called... "Grandpa." I'm hooked. And it's about a little girl and her creepy-crawly grandpa. Real quick, if this is a kid-touchy story, not interested.Well, that's what makes it so scary. This little girl, let's call her Cassie. Every day, Cassie is left alone with her grandpa and she just knows he's gonna do something. It's not just the fact that he's Romanian or Russian or something vaguely Slovak and sounds like a fucked-up vampire. It's the way his lazy eyes track her around the room as she's cleaning up or playing with her dolls. How he sits slumped at the dining room table that they haven't had a meal at since poor grandma died, his coffee table littered with old newspapers and nature magazines conveniently dog-eared to the pages of indigenous women bearing their breasts, pack after pack of Kent Kings smoked. Come here. Come to your grandpa. How is school?" Okay. I'm good. Dude, shut the fuck up. I'm not going there, okay? Anyway. Fucked-up thing. Cassie tries to hide. Grandpa tries to find her. Shuffling around in his pajamas, wheeling around that squeaky oxygen tank. Always knew where grandpa was 'cause of that squeaky tank. Most fucked-up part is his dog, Rover -- just nipped at Cassie any time she came around, and grandpa would shrug it off. "Oh, he loves you maybe more than grandpa, I tink." Just kidding. Cassie knew how much grandpa loved his sloppy soups and warm apple sauces. So one say before dinner, she goes to the medicine cabinet and decides to poison him. You know, she's like, "I don't know. Maybe medicine will make him better or maybe it will make him dead. But either way, I shall be happier. Also I'm 5, so I don't know better." So she takes the medicine out, and she breaks the little pills like a mini Paul Sheldon "Misery." Sprinkles them over the soup and serves grandpa. But just as grandpa is about to take his first sip... ...he begins to cough. And soon... ...the cough turns into a full emphysemic attack. He spasms and knocks the soup over. Before he can say, "Down boy," Rover runs over... ...and eats all of it. Stop. Sorry. That just makes me uncomfortable. Not long after Rover lap-lap-laps up all that soup, as expected, he drops dead right there, right in front of them. As you can imagine, grandpa is beside himself. "Nyet! Nyet! Oh, Oh, my-ah suka. Suka... Grandpa's health quickly declines after that. Few days later, Cassie kneels next to grandpa's bed and shovels Greek yogurt or applesauce or some soft shit into his mouth, but he's just too sad. It just gets all over his face. Like... "Cassie, come here. I have secret for you." Well, Cassie doesn't want to "cyum heahr." But she does 'cause she knows what she did, and she's like," You know, whatever. It'll be over soon. Remember what mom said. Be nice to grandpa. He don't got long left." And he grabs her arm with his gnarly fingers. "Oh, grandpa, you're hurting me." "Shh. Shh. I know what you did. I know you tried to kill me but you killed doggy instead." "No, grandpa, I swear. I didn't mean to. I promise it was a mistake. It was an accident." "When I..." He starts choking, you know? He's got the food all over his mouth. It's fucking disgusting. "When I come back, I'm going to get you. - Wow. - She's just fucking crying. "Shh. Yes, cry. You cry little girl 'cause you try to kill me but you killed doggy instead. Is so much worse. So Cassie's mom sees her little girl just totally inconsolable, just crying, and she thinks she's sad. But no, she's fucking terrified. Mom shields Cassie's eyes from the dead body, pointing her directly to the wall where the only piece of art... is a portrait... of grandpa's... beloved dog, Rover. Cue convenient thunder and lightning. Thank you. So! Couple years later, Cassie's in high school. - Show me those details. - Don't interrupt me. So, one day, they leave her home alone, and Cassie plops down on the couch, pops in a VHS -- something innocuous. - "Howard the Duck." - Don't interrupt me. Sorry. Cassie's splayed out on the couch, watching "Howard the Duck." Ah, damn it. - I'm Howard the duck. - When the phone rings... "Hello?" Cassie's voice and body are stunted from the childhood trauma. It's a psychological disorder. "Hello? "Cassie..." If this was a movie, I'd dolly in real slow right about now. "Cassie... Do you know who this is? It's grandpa. I told you when I come back, I was going to gyet you. And that's when she hears it. In the house. The squeak. Nice sound effects. Cassie's like, "What do I do? Should I get a knife or somethin'?" And she walks... slowly to the staircase. Whatever it is... It's close. And then she sees it. There at the top of the stairs is grandpa's shitty, shitty Shih Tzu. "R-Rover?" It traipses down the stairs with a sickly gait... ...one cockeyed leg in front of the other... and rowls... towards... Cassie... ...reeeaaal slow. And... gets... directly in her... face. The door opens by itself. ♪♪ Out slinks the ghostly dog, and in walks mom. They find Cassie, face white as a Japanese toilet, clutching a knife. "Sweetheart..." "Don't call me that. I need a break.

Stick him like the little creepy pig he is, and then, things will turn around around here. If you don't, I'll kill you and everyone you know. Oh, okay. Okay. Um. Tomorrow night, he'll be working late. Do it then. I'll be right there watching. Hold up, Devin. Ah. Killing my boss is a big F'ing deal. What do I get in return? Uh. I don't... know, story-wiiise. Okay, maybe she kills her boss and then she has to kiss the troll and she gets like, uh, 300 years of life. Oh, yeah. That's good. Yeah. Y-- Kill your boss and then kiss me, and you'll live for 300 years. Oh, you're too ugly to kiss. You literally just told me to say that. Well, you make a very good point, Devin the troll. Okay. Kill my boss, live to see my granddaughter's granddaughters, and kiss a troll. Wow, a lot of rules, but yeah, okay. I'm in. Deal. So, Karen goes about her business, you know, selling baskets that are edible or whatever, and the day comes where she's working late and she has to kill her seemingly harmless boss. And her heart is pounding. And she ducks into his office. But he's not there. Oh, hey. You lookin' for somethin'? Oh. I, um... I was just -- I was looking for someone. I was actually looking for you. Oh, were ya? And just like that, all her doubts go flying out the window 'cause sure her enough, her creepy-fucking boss moves on her like the pervert he is. Oh. His hand moves all around her body, up her neck, in her mouth ... in her... lips, cheek. Oh. He rubs his little, tiny disgusting erection against his K-Mart khakis. His breath sounds smells like a PB and J sour melt sammie. Ew. Yeah, no shit, ew. We're trying to empathize with her, you know. Make -- Make us really want to kill this motherfucker. So Karen is pressed against the wall, surrounded by edible arrangements. You know, which is ironic, because they're just supposed to make people feel better. How am I gonna kill this guy? And then she sees them. Scissors. He's got her by the shoulders now, and he's complimenting her on how great she smells, which is ironic, because he smells like a -- Dirty diaper. Yeah. Like a dirty diaper filled with sour cream. Oh, God. Well, point is he's disgusting, and Karen's got the scissors by her side now. They're hidden. And she's like... Oh, gosh. I've never killed someone. "Does living for 300 years really mean that much to me?" But then she feels those two beady yellow eyes staring at her from the air ducts. ♪♪ Is that the dishwasher? I thought the power was out. - Stay in it. - Yeah. Come on. Don't be a coward. Wow, you must really want that kiss, huh? Anyway, her boss says something condescending to her. Something like, Oh, you're such a good girl." Yeah, or like, "You got a lot to learn, and I'm a really good teacher." No, you know, something more, uh, subtle. That's too on the nose, subtle and creepy. Something like, "Oh, you bore me." But, you know, he's fully erect. And the troll's pissed now. He's like, "Do it! Do it or I'll do it my-fucking-self! Karen stabs! Uh-oh. Oh, yeah. It's like, um, his mousy secretary has come back into the room. She's forgotten something.Yeah. Karen? Barbara. It's not what it looks like. And that's when the troll's like, "Kill her, quick! No witnesses!" I'm gonna eat you alive! Ow! Ow! God. It's not that it's not painful to sit like that. It's just... Oh, Lord. Yeah. Oh, um... The deed done, the troll, um... Oh, yeah. Uh, you know, uh. Yeah, he's like -- He's like... He comes at the woman. He's like, "Good teamwork. You killed your boss."Yeah, I mean, I-I think it'd be a little more official than that, yeah, right, like, um... It'd be more, yeah. It'd be more, like a... A-A-A murderess' streak I'll dredge of you yet, my lady. Now, how about that kiss. He's kind of a pirate in my version. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah, and then he -- and the t-- the troll leans in. Oh, uh, yeah. So does -- So does the lady. And to think, 300 years of life... Ain't so bad. It's not so bad. Not so bad Excuse me. Sorry. I'm Carlo! What the fuck is a Carlo?! Pizza. I'm a pizza guy. I'm a pizza -- pizza guy.Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you guys. Yeah, it's fine. Uh-huh. Yeah, well, you definitely didn't scare us. I mean, excuse me, I definitely did because you definitely screamed really loudly, but... Half-cheese and half-veggie, right? Oh, right. Oh, yeah, um, yeah.Thank you so much. Fred's paying, right? Oh, the -- Yeah, I sure... Thanks, dude. Wow. Great tip, man. Appreciate it. Alright, well, you guys have a great evening, okay, uh... I'm glad to see you guys aren't killing each other out here 'cause it would be the perfect night to do it, you know? It's like, "Wait, what are you doing out here?" "Nah, I'm -- I'm just..." He didn't even see that coming. You know, then just put him in a conveniently located car, right? And then someone else saw me. "Oh no!" "Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh." And he's dead, right? Put him in the trunk. Wow, that was really creepy. Sorry about that, guys. Whoo, anyway. Good night.Night. Wait, wait, wait! Ah. Ahh, plates, right? For pizza? You need plates. Right. Oh, uh, no. Y-You seem like a fella who might be interested in some scary stories. And you seem correct. It's almost like you'd think I'd be tired of pizza, right? But like, no. I love our pizza. It's like the best in town. You know? It's like, in the area probably, to be honest. Right on, man. So, um, Fred and I -- my friend over here -- we have been, uh, riding out the storm by telling each other scary stories. Oh, that sounds cool. So, like, you guys, like, are -- like, Boy Scout leaders or something like that? No, um... I'm a -- Well, we're writers. I'm not a... Well, Fanny's a writer. Fanny's famous. Fannie's a famous writer. I'm not famous. Ouch. Emancipated much? Wait, what's it -- It's not emancipated. It's not that. Immaculate. No, it's the opposite of that. It's just like that but bad. Ooh, emasculated! That's it. You are emasculated! Look at you! You're a emasculated man! I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding, man. Come on. Chin up, man, ah. Have you heard of "Venus?" Oh, come on. Let's not. Oh, the book? Of course. That's her. Wait. You wrote "Venus?" Sure did. I'm sorry. You wrote "Venus?" Mm-hmm. You. Youdid that. The person right here opened a laptop, just, I don't know -- just casually wrote the best horror book of all time. That's you? Oh. It's not the best horror book of all time. I mean, I know Amazon said that and like a couple blogs and the New York Times and The Guardian and Wall Street Journal. Oh, and Vulture. It's a New York magazine one. But not everybody. - That is dope! - Yeah. And you're in for a treat, Carlo, because it's Fanny's turn to tell a story, so congratulations, buckle up, and you're welcome. She's really good at it. Actually, I think, uh, since Carlo is our guest, he should be the one to decide who tells a story andwhat it's about, right, sweetie pie? Wait -- Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope. Do one about dead babies. Right? Like an a army of them. Ya know, they've got, like, little baby hands. They just like, "We don't want bottles, we want blood." You know? Like, it can be like a musical. It's like a terrifying musical. ♪ We're dead babies with really bad scabies ♪ Terrible. Baby scabies. Real bad. Ha. Or... we could do one about a, uh -- like a... t-teenager who's in school, and he gets like a s-- he gets sick. He gets an illness or something, and he's like -- his skin's falling off, so it's kind of like he becomes like a ghoul. Ah! Too Ghoul For School! That is very clever! Thank you. No, for real. That is very clever. Nice wordplay. I'm writing it down. She's writing it down.You can't write that down. Why not? Because it's not your idea. It's not an idea. It's a title. I'm writing a title. Yeah, I thought about it, and I don't even care. Will you stay out of this, please? Okay. Ouch. I mean, ouch for real. Okay, boys. Just settle down. Now who wants to do some cocaine? Sorry, I don't have a lot. Wow. A writing retreat without enough drugs. How do you do it? I don't see you contributing anything. You're drinking my booze, aren't you? Anyway. I don't do drugs. You've never done coke?!Dude. Dude! You've never done coke? You puss-say! Pussy! I'm not a pussy. I've just never done coke. Okay? You wouldn't want to see me on coke if I did it. Oh, okay. Let me do one more. Oh! Birthdays! Yeah. Slow down, Lohan. Man, I haven't done that shit since college. Where did you go to college? Oxford.Hmm. Got ya. Alright, guys. Let's do some scares! Scares! Fanny, fanny, bo-banny. I can't wait! Why don't you do "Venus." Fred, this is an evening of original work. Fanny, one of your biggest fans is present. He would love -- Carlo, wouldn't you? Carlo would love to hear you perform your life's work. Ow, my nose.Ahhh... that is not my words, but, uh, uh, uh, not wrong, either. Enlighten us. Enlighten me. I mean, I haven't read it, but I bought dinner, didn't I? Oh, you buy me dinner, you expect a story? Yeah. Yeah, I do. "Venus." By Fanny Addie, whoo! Whoa, oh, ah, sorry, hey. Kicked this bear. Does anybody own it? It's not your house. "Venus" is the story of a young mother and her little boy, and they're going on vacation in the Catskills. And that's when we hear something in the room! - Ah! - It's a dare! And that part scared the living shit outta me. Ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba! Taxidermy. There's this big stuffed moose on the wall. - Hey, Fred! - Fred! Stay in it, Fred! Jason's watching scary movies! It's the dead bus driver! Gets blood all over her face, god damn it! She's infected! What? .22! Bang, bang, bang, bang, ka-blam! Cuckaw! Bam! He blows everybody's brains out! Anyway! I do this really amazing job of setting up this really honest... Hello, miss. Can I use your bathroom? She lets him in. He's handsome. But he doesn't use the bathroom. Are you one of them? Huh? Mom thinks fast. She grabs a cleaver, but he's faster. Then something really weird happened. Run Jason! Ruuun! Then all the sudden, the mom appears -- changed! He tries to get away, but he can't run. He's like, wait, what am I doing, oh... Hi. S-So mom just turns into a zombie vampire? Well, that -- We don't call them that explicitly.Never explained. Never explained. But that's what I love about it. Ohh. I mean, look, we left out a lot of details, but the truth is, like, "Venus" is not just about, like, a zombie-like outbreak that only affects women. It's really about gender politics. Mm-hmm. Huh. I don't see it.D-- You don't s-- You don't see it. Um. It's about how men cling to their mothers. These, uh, invincible, infallible humans who can do no wrong. Yeah. I don't know. My mom was kind of a... Kind of a bitch. Wow. Okay. Wow, wow, wow. Um, well, on that note... Yeah. You know, I'd just like to take second to acknowledge, to laud, to fucking celebrate this man right here. This creative, beautifully-nuanced partner in scares, Mr. -- Uh, what's your last name, sweetie? Oh. Oh, I -- I don't tell anybody that. Oh, yeah. Mr. Carlo, the enigmatic Carlo. Thank you. Thank you very much. I, uh, I don't have a speech prepared, so I won't say one. Mmm. You still high? I am very high now. NNNot me. No. I'm still high. You gonna go, Fred? You want me to leave? Oh, you want me to go. My turn. Uh... How 'bout we do something a little cheery, you know? All these tales of tortured kids. Why don't we do something with a little music? You know, Fred, that is -- that is a good idea. No, really, you are -- You are truly onto something. A story about a singer. What else? A singer that is, uh, also like a teen slasher? Teen slasher singer. Oh. A singer... possessed by the devil. Oh, fucking -- You know what, Fred? You're on a fucking roll. Really. True -- True genius coming out. Ohh... So we got, uh -- we got singer, we got band, we got the devil. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.Oh, this sounds so fucking epic already. She's just a small town girl. She's living in a crazy world. She's always wanted to do more. She'd do anything to sing on national TV! Maybe like "A Star is Born," but Satan! And she's got, like, a good song. It's a really good song, though. It's a big show. It's a big show. It's a big show, and millions of people watch it. She's gonna be on "American Idol!" Yas, queen! Yaaas! Yeah. Stakes! Stakes! Stakes! Give me all the stakes! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I would sell my soul to be on "American Idol." Or another show that doesn't give us copyright issues. Anyway, so for our purposes in our little story, we're gonna call it. The Big Talent Show Live! The Big Talent Show Live. The Big Talent Show... The Big Talent Show Live. The Big Talent Show Live. Leading up to the performance, our lead singer, mm, Beth. Let's call her Beth. Beth starts to have... a little bit of a reaction... to her possession! Her voice... starts to... get hoarse and all over the place... and her skin starts to peel, and her band's like, "Hey, um, Beth, are you okaaay?" Yeah, you don't look so good. I'm fine. I'm fine! We're gonna kill it tonight. Which is really funny, you know, 'cause the song is so sweet, right? It's like ♪ feel music, feel the light ♪ and Beth's just... We're go, guys. BRB! Yo, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, dude. I am worried about Beth.I'm worried about Beth, too, just the same, but maybe more.This is our one shot. Yeah, one shot is all it takes. It's all I have. We're gonna be on national television.Everybody I know is here and everybody I don't know. She's gonna be on the Big Talent Show Live. Something doesn't feel right. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart. Feeling a little... under the weather? I -- I sold you my soul for this. Please... Five minutes to this program. Welcome to the nationally televised event. Millions of people are watching. I hope nothing bad happens. Don't fuck this up for me, the devil. Good luuuck. And now without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... What are we calling her again? Beth. We're calling her Beth. That's right. Okay! Please welcome Beeeth! ♪♪ This... is an original. ♪ Feel the music, feel the light ♪ ♪ Hold me close and squeeze me tight ♪ ♪ Whisper in my ear ♪ ♪ I want to hear you say ♪ ♪ I want to stay all night ♪ ♪ Let this beat take you away ♪ ♪ Let your mind and body sway ♪ ♪ With mine in time ♪ ♪ Until it's time to die ♪ ♪ Yeah, it's time to take them down ♪ ♪ Lay their bodies in the ground ♪ ♪ Let's shut 'em up, then cut 'em up ♪ ♪ And feed them to the worms ♪ ♪ Kill the children and their mothers ♪ ♪ Kill your sisters and your brothers ♪ ♪ And then let's kill ourselves ♪ ♪ That's the good word ♪ ♪ Of the King of Hell ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Get ready ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Get ready ♪ ♪ Kill all the fucking children, yeah ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ And then... a moment of respite. Oh, my God. The audience just stares at her slack-jawed in shock and awe. Everybody's covered in vomit. Even Beth's shitty boyfriend is just covered in disgusting, vile, sour devil vomit. But then the devil speaks to hear. I hope you're having fun, but now the real show begins. Then the devil rips through her chest with his devil arm. It's fucking sick like "Alien," but it's a Satan arm, and it starts thrashing, man. It's thrashing so fucking hard. It's sick. I was kind of thinking that he gives, like, a really important monologue to the nation all about how, like, our culture's toxic and, you know, we take advantage of young talent. Or. Or, or, or, he could send his evil through TVs across America and possess the country. That's been done before.They did that in "Batman Forever." Mmm, yeah, but that wasn't the devil, though. Oh, crap. I gotta go. Damn it. Nooo! I know. Carlooo! Ah. Pizza Man of the Year, Carlo! I-I-I don't want to leave, Fanny, but I have this Hawaiian I should've had in Wamba Jukes Falls like two hours ago. They're gonna be pissed. Anyway, guys have a great night. - Jim Carey's Riddler. - We miss you, Scarecrow. Ahh... It's the same. Wasn't the devil.Yeah, but it was the same concept, same idea. 'Kay. You know, it's like -- It's like one of those nights, you know, where you leave to deliver a pizza to a couple of strangers who end up being your friends and tell ghost stories and do blow. One's your favorite author, and the other one is a Fred. Hey, Fanny. Nope, not going to do that. Yes, I am going to do that right now. Can I have your autograph, please? Face or paper? Okay, uh, if you could just write, like, "Hey, Carlo, my best friend! We did coke together and ate pizza, told ghost stories." Or whatever. I'm not a writer. Don't put yourself down. It's exactly what I wrote. Thanks, Fanny. Aww. Okay. Okay. Hey, it was fun. Bye, Fred! Where are you going? Oh, I'm gonna fill the bucket. Must take a much-needed cocaine defecache. You know, plumbing's all fucked 'cause of the storm. ♪♪ Don't go in there, huh? Alright, I'm tired. I'm gonna head out. Aw... Why the long face? 'Cause it's over? I just -- I feel like I had fun for the first time in like a really long time. So. Aw... I just... I needed that. That's all. So sweet. Well, let's do coffee tomorrow before you go wherever, you know, you're gonna go. Hey, wait. I got one more. Story? Oh, God. Oh, God. It's 4:00 in the morning, I smell like cheese and campfire, and you are definitely... not drunk. Mnh-mnh. Okay. Gimme the log line. It's a psychological thriller. Always engaging. About... a killer... We haven't done one about, like, a straight-up... slasher yet. ...and the woman who got under his skin. Ohh... It's very Lifetime movie. Yes, okay. Hit me. Okay. Little setup for you. So she... She's this, like, hard-worker type. She could do no wrong, no matter how much she fucked up. She's one of those lucky freaks that just has it easy, you know? She does what she wants, and it p-- it pisses -- pisses him off. Yeah, so it's sort of like classic story of emasculated boy by a strong female. Ooh, what's the title? Is it, uh... Is it "My Life: Story of Women Everywhere?" Yeah. The guy, he's not doing so hot. You know, his personal life is not so great. He -- He tries. He's li-- He's the -- the type -- type of guy who, like, really tries, but he just doesn't have the... Talent? I mean, you try writing for a bunch of chicken wing chains and paint shops and you just want to fucking kill everybody, but you can't 'cause it's illegal. That's part of the story? Obvs. By a total chance, he meets this a-woman. Mmm.This powerful amazing woman who's had it easy. He meets this woman who's a-a powerful woman. She's a powerfulwoman, and they actually hit it off. And he meets her and she meets him, and he's actually like, "Wow, this girl makes me feel really... good! Having so much fun, he, like, legitimately forgets that he's... bad. He forgets... He forgets he's got a fucked-up life. He forgets he cheated on his wife. He forgets he lost his temper one or two or three many times. He forgets about all the mean letters that he wrote her. Yeah, Fred. You're losing me here. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. You're a better storyteller than me. You're better! You're better than me! I get it! You're better than me! So I'm just gonna skip to the good part. I'll get to the end. I'll get to the end. They decide to stay up all night and tell each other scary stories. It was her crazy idea, and he was super into it because he fucking loves scary stories. And it's fun, and as the night goes on, the fun just starts to kind of... die. You know? That initial feeling of being included, it just sorta starts to fall away, and he starts to kind of feel like a windup monkey, there to just make this chick feel better about herself. Where at first he was really inspired by her, by the end of the night, he couldn't help but feel... used. Fred. What are you doing with that poker? Huh. This guy's just, like -- who's struggling. You know, he's honestly struggling. He's spending every ounce of his savings, just trying to take one shot at his... dream. And she just gets to live hers. Okay, I get it. You read my notebook. Your -- Your notebook? This notebook? Look, it's private shit, okay. And I get that you're trying to scare me with this poker bullshit, but it's not working, okay. It's just pissing me off. This is the part in the story where... the creepy strings kick in. Can you hear 'em? No, Fred, I can't hear 'em because we're done. We're done telling stories. Alright? Now give me my fucking notebook back. 10 pages of which are all about... wannabe-writer Fred. Fragile Fred. Fragile Freddy. When did you write all this shit? When you were sitting across from me eating pizza with your next best friend? Well, I don't know, Fred. If I knew dairy would turn you into a fucking psychopath, I wouldn't have ordered a pizza. I paid for it, didn't I? You've been taking notes all night, Fanny. Why? Why? Because I'm a writer, dude. Because we make observations about the world around us and make note of it. That's what writers do. I'm doing the fucking work. What are you doing? You rented this cabin to do what? Pretend to do your werewolf epic? Come on, dude. You want my life. Fucking just do the work. Do the work. Do the work.Yeah, do the work. Steal from a nobody. Oh, spare me. You think people haven't stolen my ideas? I'm a horror writer, and I'm a lady. Everybody fucking steals from me. You know how I deal with it? I do it better than them. Just when you think you can let your guard down, some conceited little girl decides she can use you for inspiration. Little girl. You know, I think I finally figured you out. You're not some sad, emasculated failure. No, that's too interesting. You... You are just a man who thinks he's good. But he knows that he'll never be great. This is insane. This is an insane conversation. It's insane you're taking things so fucking personally, and it's really fucking insane that you're holding that poker and trying to scare me 'cause you're not fucking scaring me, okay, dude?! So give me my fucking notebook or I will fucking kill you! Okay. Okay. Here you go. Sorry. Wait. Why make it that easy. Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. How about... I chase you. We can pretend we're in one of our stories. I can't find you, mm, give you your notebook back. But if I dofind you... Come on, Fred. Just, um... Would you please give me my notebook back. Please? Okay, yeah. Sorry. Psych! Oh, come on, Fanny. Why the long face? All night you wanted me to scare you and now you're... I'm not gonna hurt you. Run! Run! Run! Fanny, wa-- Man down. Fanny... Thump, thump, thump. Thump. Thump. Thump, thump. Creepy footsteps, right? Right? Fanny? This might be the creepiest story yet. And I thought of it. Okay. I guess you win. Hey. Fanny! Fanny! W-- Fuck, Fred... Look what you did. Fuck, Fred. You fragile fuck. You fucking psychopath. I was only kidding. I'm so sorry. Hey, Fanny. I... Can you do me a favor? What? I want you to finish me off. Yeah. Please. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh, that's good. That's a log. That's good. Oh, that's good idea. Cue the creepy strings, right? Yeah. Creepy strings. It adds comforting. Hey.
