This was the view from my window, in the army hospital on Governor's Island. For three long months I lay there watching the town I was born and raised in the way a guy waits for a girl he loves. And that's how I felt about New York. The day they let me out and gave me my discharge papers I didn't tell anybody about it but my old sidekick, Al Doyle big breezy con man who'd cut himself in on every deal I'd ever pulled. - Hi, Al. - Hiya, Nick. Sure glad to see ya, fella. You've changed some and it ain't that uniform you're wearing. Well, how? Fatter? Older? I don't know, I can't tell yet. - Were you shot up bad? - Right to the center. My fingers don't flex so good, but it'll work out alright. Anyway it got me my honorable discharge. Come on, let's get outta here. - Leaving us, eh, sarge? - That's right. I'm on my way. - Good luck. - Thanks, Art. Nice knowing you. - So long. - Good luck. How about that guy? Soldiered with him for 14 months and he brushes me off like that. - He's in a hurry to get out. - No. He's a strange bird. I don't know any more about him now than I did when I started. - Good luck, sarge. - Thanks. You should have his luck. I had to give my right name to get that pass. While we rode the ferry back to Manhattan Al gave me all the news, how things had changed on Broadway since I'd been away. Suckers? Whew! I've never seen so many square johns with loose dough in my life. The boys are making takes you wouldn't believe. - And very few beefs. - How's Toni? She's fine, fine. - "How's Toni," you ask-- - Did you see her lately? No, I haven't seen her lately. She's running some big gyp cafe. You know, breast of guinea fowl. One order, ten bucks. With her my credit's no good, so.. This is sure news to me. Cafe business ought to be tops. I guess she's looking after my dough okay. Your dough? Yeah. I had 50 G's before I was drafted. And let Toni hold it for me. Boy, we're sure in a heavy moola then, ain't we? So now, I had a business. Al said she'd also moved into my apartment while I was gone. Well, why not? She'd be living there soon anyway. Mr. and Mrs. Nick Blake. Boy, that sounded great. It was getting dark as we rode up Broadway. Right from the Battery to Times Square and every light in the city seemed to be turned on just to welcome me. There's nothing for a soldier like coming home. And then there's that too-bit chiseler, Chalky Rose, remember? In the old days he was hitting me for fins. Now he's rollin' in dough. Cornered a warehouse full of bourbon. It's getting just like the old prohibition days. Loose dough. Everybody making it and throwing it away. The old town looks mighty good at that. I think it would after what you've seen. What I'm tryin' to say is, the sooner you get back in the harness, the sooner we'll be rich. Thought I'd take rest for a while. Sure. We'll jump up to Saratoga for a few weeks. Give you a chance to talk to some boys. It'll be a relief after all those GI farmers. Some pretty good guys in my outfit. Some pretty good guys? I thought the army only took square johns. Smart guys like yourself worked an angle, huh? 'Ain't women messy?' Looks alright to me. 'Say, that Saratoga idea is a good one.' - Mocky Smith and-- - I said I wanted to rest. I don't mean two weeks. Ain't women the limit? Always rubbing stuff on themselves. I know guys overseas who'd give ten bucks to smell one of those bottles. I didn't know you smoked a pipe. I never saw this before. Maybe it's her cousin's. Good evening, Mr. Blake. Biggest weekend we've ever had. Another year of this and we can retire. Yeah. And I'll be ready. I'm getting fed up singing every night to a bunch of Park Avenue drunks. - Yes, Andre? - Nick Blake just came in. 'Nick Blake?' Must have made a mistake. He's in the army, overseas. Table nine. Okay, Andre. Take them a bottle of the best champagne and four glasses. Let's get out of here. No, wait. We'll settle this now. Go ahead. I'll join you. Bad place for a beef, Nick. - Look at the crowd. - Maybe there won't be any beef. - What's this? - Compliments of the house. Nick, I just found out you were here. Hello, Toni. That's not much greeting after all this time. Well, it's a little public here. Sit down. - Hi, Toni. - Hello, Al. Why the four glasses? That's for Mr. King. He'll be here in a moment. Chet King? What's he gotta do with it? - Look, Nick, Mr. King is-- - Hello, Blake! Al, how are you? Where have you been? Haven't seen much of you. Well, Blake. Here's luck to you. - 'Glad you're back.' - Thanks. Did you go to the apartment? I knew I'd find you here. Wanted to see you. I'm so glad. Wanted to find out how we're doing as partners in this setup. Looks like a nice take. What's he mean, Toni? I tried to tell him a minute ago. Nick, this is Mr. Kings place. We only use my name because it's a draw. Wait, Al told me about this place I figured you put my money to work for me. I don't know how to tell you this, but.. I opened a place of my own about year ago with your money. I didn't know the ropes. Before I got wised up I went bankrupt. Just like that. Too bad, Blake. I should've been here to advise her. 'You don't know how sorry I am, Nick.' I wanted to write to you about it but I figured you had enough on your mind. Your number's coming up now, Miss Blackburn. Oh, thanks, Bob. Don't go away fellas. I'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, my favorite singer and yours Miss Toni Blackburn. Great girl, Toni. Big draw. * Guess who's on my mind? * * You again * * When I'm with you that old feeling is new again * * Every kiss I steal * * Has a new appeal * * Something unforeseen intrigues me * * You know what I mean * * Guess who's in my dream? * * You again * * When I awake why am I always blue again? * King, it's noisy here. Let's go in your office. What for? A little business I'd like to talk over with you. * ...keeps asking me when * * We'll meet again * * To love just you again * * Ever since that first night we sat * * Giving our heart.. * Wait here, Al. * I felt the same I guess love's to blame * * You're in my heart to stay * * Fate must've.. * - Cigar? - No, thanks. Why don't you smoke your pipe? - What do you want, Blake? - In two words, my dough. - What dough? - I know all about you, King. You can get a bankroll if there's some dumb dame around. That's okay with me. Just so long it's not my dough. Take it up with Toni. She lost it. I don't want to get rough with you unless I have to. * Every now and then * * My heart keeps asking me * * When we'll meet again * * To laugh again to live again * * To love again * * I'll tell * * You then * * It's you * * Again ** Miss Blackburn will be back with us a little later. 'Now let's dance.' - I want to see Nick. - He'll be out in a minute. Toni, all the time I was in the army I didn't have much else on my mind but you. All the way home on that hospital ship I kept seeing your face waiting for me. Nick, darling. And another thing, I can understand you wanting to take a risk. Okay. But what's the matter with Saratoga? Why California? You'll be tired before you reach. It's a great spot. Clear away from everything. You can say that twice. I want to see an old pal. Pop Gruber. You remember him? You mean that ol' has-been? That chiseling-- In my book, he's okay. Gin. And another thing. You got your mustering out pay and I got a little dough. Mighty little since I bought them railroad tickets. You ain't going to get much rest. 'We gotta make a strike.' 'I didn't mind you beating him up' 'but what good did it do? You can't eat it.' Mr. King kicked in. How can you do this to me? Why don't you let me in on things? My original investment plus interest. Boy! Deal the card. We'll play for keeps now. Are you sure we're still in the United States? I think Los Angeles is. Stop at the plaza first. I'll tell you where to go from there. How about it, folks? See the wonders of nature. Tonight Saturn is visible with its ring. You can also see the Mountains of the Moon. It's only one dime, folks. Just one thin dime. What do you say, mister? How about you? Take a look at the moon for a dime? Why not? I've paid a lot more to see a lot less. Well, look right in here. Close one eye. See, the moon is full tonight. It's beautiful, ain't it? Say, that's got more warts than a toad. Those are mountains and valleys just like we have. Only the moon is dead. - Nothing lives on it. - I don't like that. Makes me unhappy to think of it up there in space all by itself. Yeah, I know how you feel, but.. Nick. How are you, boy? Fine, Pop. I see business is pretty good. Yeah. I was just about to close a deal. Are you sure that's the moon I'm looking at? I'll guarantee it. That's all, mister. Just a minute. I haven't paid you your dime. Never mind the dime. That's on the house. Come on, move on. I just got in from the East, Pop. Thought I'd drop by and see if you were still at the same stand. Glad to see you. What happened? Did you lam out of the army? No, I got an honorable discharge. Talked to 'em out of it? Same old Nick. You here all by yourself? Al Doyle's with me, waiting in the cab. Thank you for that box you sent. You were the only guy that remembered me. That's okay. I did that for old time's sake. But say, Nick, tell me how does the big town look? Must've been a lot of changes since my time? Yeah. Everything's changed. Don't ever go back. - It'll disappoint you. - Oh, nothing could do that now. What brought you out? Got something lined up? I'm out of circulation. I want to rest and not take orders. Sure must've been tough for you to take orders. - Where you stayin'? - I'll tell you later. Come out and we'll split a bottle of beer. - Swell. - I'll be seeing you. Okay, Nick. How about it, folks? See the wonders of nature. Tonight Saturn is visible with its ring. You can see the Mountains of the Moon. It's only a dime, folks. One tenth of a dollar. The one in the fifth came in too. I win $18,622. Even my parlay come in. If I only had the dough to bet with. Even your parlay, eh? You're playing with toys like a kid. The biggest thing that happened to us is around the corner and you're cutting out paper horses. Doc, a guy's gotta do something to pay us. A two million dollar sucker's waiting for us. I can't sleep at night thinking about it. There was a time when this would've been as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. Now I have no front. I'm saddled with a couple of broken-down tramps who sit there waiting for something to happen. No use getting yourself upset. It's just one of them things. - What do you know? - Where have you been? Siting in the plaza. It's a nice night. Ain't that okay? There's something I want to tell ya. Can't you remember? Yeah, I seen that New York fella, Nick Blake. He was buzzin' Pop. - Nick Blake? - Thought he was in the army. I don't know. He was wearing civvies. What do you think? He used to be doc's pet hate. Why don't you like him? He's a top man in the rackets. Top man in the rackets, my foot! Just a run of luck. He'll get caught up with. Never yet. I used to know him around Broadway. May be like Casanova Dick was. Dames went for him and did he work at it? What they see in that swell-headed phony. Wait a minute, doc. If Nick Blake's in town, he's the guy for us. He could take that dame, like that. I can make the play just as easy. I need a bankroll. - 'She wouldn't go for you.' - Plenty have. I ain't see none of 'em flockin' around. I didn't mean nothing, doc. I was just kiddin'. We know you can make the play, we need somebody to stake us. If we could contact Blake, you can talk him into financing us. It's possible. He's not so hard to break down. Just a lucky small-timer with a front. That's all. What're you laughing at? - Nick, small-timer. - You heard me. When I saw him, I had a suite in the best hotel in Miami. He was knocking with New York chiselers tryin' to pick up a little dough. He was polite to me then. He was Doctor Ganson this, Doctor that. Suddenly, he got the breaks. Luck! That's all it was. - Just plain luck. - 'You're right, doc.' I don't like the guy. Never did. You're right. We need him in this. I'll go and have a talk with Pop. Find out where Blake is. It'll be easy once I locate him. Wait a minute. You boids gonna work with a top guy? - Why not? - Oh! That's just plain dumb. Us tramps. - We getting out of our class. - Oh, shut up! Hello, Pop. I was at the corner looking for you. Fog came in. Drink up your beer. I'll buy you another. Maybe you'd like some real liquor. I only drink two beers at night. This is my second. Waiter. - A little service, please. - Yeah. What kinda brandy you got? - Just plain brandy. - No imported French brandy? Do you want the brandy we have or not? Okay. I made a little strike. Sure you won't have anything? You don't look prosperous. What do you want? - I understand Nick's in town. - Is he? - Are you kidding? - No. - It's worth a lot. - How much? We've located a sucker and thought Nick will be interested in financing the project. It's no use, doc. This is the biggest thing there is and a dame-- I said, it's no use, doc. It'll be worth 500 to you to know where we can find Blake. - Of course, you've got the 500. - Keep the change. You know, you can trust me. Why don't you stop kidding, doc? You and the boys haven't seen five C's in one piece in five years. We all have our ups and downs. I've seen time I could buy and sell Blake at his peak. - I was the biggest once. - Yeah, but once don't count. We shall call it a night. Pop, I found a widow with two million bucks and lonesome. A few years ago would have been a routine. Slightly borin' but.. - Well, times change. - Yeah, don't they? This little lady is the easiest touch there is and the biggest. Doesn't know a soul out here. Husband left her all his money. You're barkin' up the wrong tree, doc. Nick's takin' it easy and anyway he wouldn't work with you. Pop, I've been living for this one. I'm going to see that sucker's taken. A small bankroll's all I need to put me back on top. That's where I belong, on top. Not so loud. Take it easy, doc. Take it easy. Two million bucks, eh? Tell me more about this widow, doc. Thanks, Tes. - Mr. Blake not back from beach? - No. This is the life. If the boys on Broadway could see me now. My, my! - What's wrong with you? - All the time walk on beach. Up and down, maybe two, three hours. Mr. Blake not happy man. He'll be okay if we just leave him alone. - You know what I think? - What's that? Mr. Blake ought to find a nice, friendly girl. - Beach is full of girls-- - Tess. If you like it here, don't tell him that. He just got out of a jam with a nice, friendly girl. - I'd like to see Mr. Blake. - What's the name, please? Just tell him Pop Gruber's here. 'Hello, Pop. Come on in.' I was thinking who's ringing the bell. Only you know we're here. Well, what a swanky joint Nick's got here. Haven't seen one as nice as this since I've been out of the big money. And that's been some time. Nick will be in soon. Have a drink? A glass of beer, maybe. Sit down. Make yourself at home. I'll get it for you. 'Prowlin' the joint, Pop?' Sure, why not? Come out to split that bottle of beer, huh? Well, in a...in a way, yeah. Yeah! Anything else? I wanna talk to you about a big one. I told you I was gonna rest. A man can always rest afterwards. In spite of these high income taxes two million dollars is still lot of money. - How much? - Thanks. You know, Nick, I'd never come clear out here if I didn't figure I was doing you a favor. Not to mention, doing yourself one. - Naturally. - Say, what's all this? Oh, nothing. Only a two million dollar layout's located, but.. ...Nick would rather rest. Alright, let's hear it. Put on the con. I used to be pretty good earlier, but.. ...age caught up with me just like it does with everyone. Who sent you out here? As far I can make out, this is a ripe touch. A guy like you, Nick, could turn it in a month. Then you'd be on easy street. You can relax from here on in. Go on. We're listening. It seems that a widow come out here from Minneapolis. That's an original idea, taking a widow. At least listen to him, Nick. This widow can stand quite a take. She's loaded. You could set yourself a life, Nick and you'd be helpin' me out a little too. I'm sure getting tired of that ten-cent telescope. Yeah. And picking drunks pockets. Well, I'm gettin' old, eh. I do the best I can. Don't be impolite. Listen to him. 'She's livin' in Marwood Arms in the best suite in the joint.' Husband died a year ago and she don't know anybody and lonesome. Why? It's just your.. Well...if I'm boring you I guess I might as well be moving on. The take would run a couple of hundred grand-- Wait a minute, Pop. Don't go yet. Nick, this one sounds like it's beggin' to be-- Aw, let him go! He was always like that. 'Stubborn as a mule even when he was a punk kid.' - I've done alright, haven't I? - Yeah, you've done alright. But you're 34 now and from here on in it's mostly downhill. - Here we go, the con. - That's no con. When I was your age, I had the world by the tail making plenty of dough and throwing it out the window. I thought there was no end to it. Alright, look at me. That's conning on a square, I bet. Sure, sure it is. Maybe I have got a bankroll. Living like this, how long is it gonna last? What are you gonna be doing when you're 65, Nick? Selling pencils? I don't think it will ever come to that. I didn't think it would either. - No business sense at all. - I'll take care of it. So long, Pop. 'Al, aren't you going in for a swim?' I don't wanna get wet. - Have a drink, Nick. - Huh? A drink. - Swell night, huh? - Yeah, yeah. Sit down, relax. That was the idea, wasn't it? Sometimes ideas don't work out. You said it, look at Pop's idea for making a big roll. That one blew up. At the time, I thought you were crazy for nixing it. - But I guess you were right. - What do you mean? Well, that proposition is a big one. To engineer them kind, a guy has got to keep his hand in.' 'You've been away a long time, Nick.' Don't be silly, that'd be like turning over in bed for me. I don't know. 'A guy can lose his touch awful quick.' 'In this racket, one bad slip and you're cooked.' I don't make slips. That was before the war. Maybe you've been through so much, you're kinda.. ...lost your nerve. Is that what you think? Listen, Nick, if you never wanna work another deal it's okay with me. We got plenty of dough.. ...right now. It's a shame to see a tough guy like you throw away his talent. But, uh.. ...don't let me and Pop influence you. 'That's gonna cost you.' 'That's what I told you, Nick.' Put it all on Mr. Blake's bill, chum. Pop's information was a little sketchy so I did some investigating. What do you mean Pop's information? - I located and steered it. - Alright, Doc, understood. About that information, just to get it straight. The sucker's name is Mrs. Gladys Halvorsen, widow husband Carl Halvorsen, died about two years ago. Left her a fortune which amounts to over $2 million. She's staying alone at suite 901, Marwood Arms. Anything else, Doc? - I guess that about covers it. - Not quite. What you all didn't find out is that a business advisor is here. A guy with the name Manning, staying at the Marwood Arms. That may be little tough. - You sure find out things. - It's my business. Any questions? Doc? Blake, I kinda figured on handling this, myself. - We were looking for the stake. - Wait a minute, Doc. Pop worked this pretty smooth. He got me interested before lining it up. If he'd mentioned your name, I'd have said no. Is that plain enough? If you all want me to handle-- - 'We are with you, Mr. Blake.' - 'Okay. Couple of more things.' I operate alone, no interference of any kind. As long as we're satisfied. It's our pitch. I'll make you a president of it right now. - Never mind, he's just jumpy. - Alright, now about terms. You guys located the sucker, fine. I've to finance the job, do the work and the risks. - I want two-thirds. - Two-thirds? 'That's the only way I'll operate.' Two-thirds.. That only leaves one-third between us. Something is better than all or nothing. - Sit down, he's right. - No, no. If not for me, there'd be no deal. The connections, the set up, it belongs to me. Nobody's gonna gyp me out of it. - We know that. - I won't hold still for this. Suits me fine. I don't wanna work anyway. Windy and I got something to say. Say it quick then. Well? What do you figure the take will be? With that kind of money, at least a 100 G's. Will the guarantee us 30,000? If I make the take, yes. Okay, we'll go along with you. Ten grand. I get ten grand. I just figured it out. What did you do? Count it on your fingers? Ten G's. That's a lotta sweet betting money. Few years ago, I wouldn't have let a mug like that drive my car. Now you guys treat him as if he was somebody important. He must keep his health, he'd better come through. That's all I can say! He better come through. Thank you, Mr. Lloyd. Suite 1009, please. I'm glad I had that large suite available, Mr. Lloyd. - Your secretary tells-- - My secretary? - Yes, he's upstairs. - Fine. - Good morning, Mr. Manning. - Morning. - Any mail for me? - I'll see, Mr. Manning. Mr. Lloyd, pardon me. I want to introduce Mr. C.W. Manning-- These two bags and we'll store the large one. Oh, I hope you don't mind, Mr. Manning. I thought perhaps you'd like to meet him. Very important young man, I understand. Shipping. - I'm sure he didn't understan-- - Not at all, not at all. I'm sorry, Mr. Manning. There's nothing for you this morning. - Golf again today, Mr. Manning? - Everyday. It keeps me young and fit. It's a beautiful morning for golf, isn't it? I opened all the windows, Mr. Lloyd. Anything else? No, that's all. Excuse me, sir, but were you in Florida before the war? Not me, son. I used to ride at Hialeah before I got overweight. I just thought-- Must've been some other fellows. Thanks. Must've been. - That's bad. - Forget it. I ran into Manning downstairs. We're off to a good start. The sooner the better at 50 bucks a day. - Did you see the widow? - No. Tonight in the dining room we pull our first plant. Okay. By the way, watch your language. You're supposed to be a secretary not a tout. Take it easy, Nick. I speak very good grammar. But the real problem was the 17th hole. It's like this. Short and very tricky. The tee is here and the green, shall we say, is right here. 'There's a sand trap here.' 'A bunker over here.' It's not exactly that shape. It bends kind of.. But you get the idea. The 3 o'clock sea breeze was blowing in strong about from this direction. That's the wind. The sun was from over here. Pardon me, that's the sun. - Quite a problem, eh? - Oh, yes. Quite. 'The trouble was, I didn't know how to play.' - What did you do? - I took the long gamble. Ah! I said to the boy, "My mashie niblick." I played a little to the right, for the wind, of course took a full swing, threw my wrists into it. I had to get all the backspin I could, you know. Kept my head down. And then? I don't know where the ball went. We never found it. Good evening, Mr. Lloyd. Everything satisfactory? - Yes. Thank you, Mr. Evans. - If not, please let me know. Thank you, sir. Excuse me, Mr. Manning. My name is Lloyd. - And I owe you an apology. - An apology? Mr. Evans tells me, he tried to introduce us this morning at the desk. I misunderstood. Hope I didn't seem rude. Not at all. Never gave it a thought. - Mrs. Halvorsen, Mr. Lloyd. - How do you do, Mrs. Halvorsen? - How do you do? - Won't you join us? If I'm not intruding. I don't wanna make another mistake. - You're not intruding at all. - Oh, no. A pleasure. Will you have a drink? Brandy, perhaps? No, thank you. I've some work to do. Mr. Evans tells me, you've been around here some time. It's been about four months. Actually, I may stay here. It's such a beautiful place. - First trip to Los Angeles? - Yes. And wonderful climate out here. Fine for golfing. 'So many nice courses. Any sort of terrain you like.' Golfer's paradise, I call it. Yes. My secretary, Mr. Hall, Mrs. Halvorsen and Mr. Manning. - How do you do? - How do you do? Pardon me a moment. 'Will you have something, Gladys?' No, thank you, Charles. Not tomorrow. Tell them later in the week. Yes, Mr. Lloyd. Excuse the interruption, please. It's always something. Gotta ease back in the harness. Only been outta the army a few months and it's difficult to adjust myself. Have you been overseas? - Yes, cigarette? - Thank you. I've leased a house out at the beach and was planning to spend the whole day tomorrow lying on the sand doing nothing not even thinking. Sounds wonderful. I haven't gone there since I've been out here. Nor I. Waste of time for me. - I play golf every day. - Sorry to hear that. Was gonna suggest that you come to the beach with me. That's very nice of you, Lloyd, but.. - Do you play golf? - I'm afraid not. Well, I really must be going. It's funny how much you can forget about your own business in a few months. Mr. Evans said something about shipping. That your business? I've been fooling around with tugboats ever since I was a kid. About five years before the war I got interested in the salvage business. Deep sea tugs. 'We're working on reconversion plans now.' It's gonna be very big after the war. As a matter of fact.. Excuse me for talking shop. This has been very pleasant. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Odd kind of chap. Sort of a diamond in the rough. Deep-sea salvage. Sounds like an immense project. Too bad he doesn't play golf. Charles, I think I will have a brandy. Certainly, certainly. Glad to see you enjoying yourself. Waiter. Maybe they went some place else for breakfast. Maybe, but tomorrow is another day. That thing sure surprised me. She's a dish. You just don't figure a rich widow's gonna look like that. Boy! Or like this either. - Good morning, Mrs. Halvorsen. - Good morning, Mr. Hall. - Good morning. - Morning. - Won't you join us? - Well, you seem pretty busy. Not at all. Please sit with us. I'm always looking for an excuse to quit work. Beautiful day. I wonder why people in Southern California ever work. Perhaps to escape the monotony. The usual, please. As soon as I'm through with Albert, I'm going to the beach. I don't suppose you could persuade Mr. Manning to give up one morning of golf? I doubt it very much. He'd be upset the whole afternoon. There you are. - Good morning, Mr. Lloyd. - Morning. Hall. Gladys, I talked Petersen. He got in last night. He's waiting for me at the Meadowbrook Club. Wants me to have breakfast, then play a round. - Was wondering if-- - No, thank you. You run along. It's too bad, me leaving you alone every day. I wish-- You sure that you both won't come to the beach with me? Oh, no. Quite out of the question, but thanks, Lloyd. - 'Are those the tugs?' - Yeah. 'I had no idea, they were so large.' Well, this is the deep-sea type. 'They hold about 300 tons' 'steam driven, their engines develop about 1200 horsepower.' - 'And they can tow anything.' - Salvage, eh? Should be a tremendous business. Very interesting. Good heavens, I got to go. Mrs. Halvorsen, why don't you come with me? Why, thank you. I'd like to very much. Fine. Fine, that's a good idea. Well, have a nice time. Goodbye, all. - Bye, Charles. - Will you be ready in an hour? Right after breakfast, if I can come like this. Oh, sure. Just bring a bathing suit. That was heavenly! Yeah, a good dip really takes the kinks out. Kinks? Sure. Everybody gets 'em once in a while. When I was a boy my old man used to call 'em the fantods. He'd just pack up and go fishing. It's hard to think of you as a boy. Why? Do I seem as solemn as all that? I didn't mean that. I mean, you seem so sure of yourself. As if, as if you could take care of yourself no matter what the surroundings were. I was brought up in a tough school. I was a riverfront kid in New York and the whole district was a playground for hoodlums. You had to fight or run and I did little of both and learned which to do when. I'll never forget those days. Don't stop? It's very interesting. It may sound interesting, but it wasn't. All I thought about was getting out. By the time I was 13, I was working on a tugboat and I kicked around plenty, but I learned the business. 'When the war started' 'I was practically running the company.' You've done very well, but you can't be more than 31 or 32. Thirty four, and I'm going to do a lot better. Now I'm bragging. You have a right to. I, uh, I don't know why I'm telling you these things. Please, do. I don't talk much myself, as a rule, but I like to listen. Well, I, I like to hear myself talk so we should get along alright. How nice you look, Mr. Hall. This has been a lovely day. Quite the nicest I've had for a long long time. It doesn't take much to please you. No, not much. I've been around so little. You see, Mr. Halvorsen was never in really good health. So we seldom travelled. He liked to sit at home and read a book or listen to the radio. Not that I minded. I was happy to do whatever he wanted. Better not let other wives hear you say that or they'll put you out of the union. I didn't feel that I missed anything. He depended on me a great deal. Before we're married, I was his secretary for nearly five years. You're not exactly my idea of a secretary. That's because you think of me as a well-to-do woman. But it wasn't always like that. My father.. I think I'll repeat what you said this after noon. I don't know why I'm telling you all these things. I never had a better day in my life. A little quite for you perhaps. Oh, please don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying that you're fast, Mr. Lloyd. It's just that you seem.. ...a little less conventional than most of the men I've met. Well, personally...I like to get drunk once in a while. Not too drunk and not too often, but don't tell on me. Manning might not like it. - Shall we go? - Yes. It'll be lovely driving back, the moon is just coming up. Well, got anything? About what? You wouldn't hold out on me, would you? - Talk plain. - About the deal. Listen, I'm waiting here just like you are. You've the best guy in the business in there. - That's a matter of opinion. - Not to me, it ain't. I always did figure you were thick with Blake. Talk to him lately? What am I, the school boy and you the teacher? I come in here to enjoy a glass of beer after I quit work. Stop bothering me. Not healthy to talk to me like that. Why not? I've talked like that to tougher guys than you. I'm a past 60 and I'm still here. All I can say is Blake had better make this. I'm counting on it. Counting on it big. My first chance to get out of the red in five years. He'll make it or it can't be made. Blake's playing this dame as if he was more interested in taking her than the dough. Forgetting business. Whatever he's doing, he ain't forgetting business. Let me give you a tip go away and relax until this thing's over. You're gettin' jumpy. - Tell Nick, if he doesn't get-- - Quit acting like a Reuben. If you're gonna hand out threats, hand 'em out to Nick. While I'm talking, I might as well tell you this. I don't like you, I never did and I never will. I'm sorry I got Nick hooked up with you. From now on, stay away from me, you understand? I wish I could rhumba well. A man looks kind of silly doing this. It's alright for a woman. As a matter of fact, I haven't danced at all for years. I used to dance quite a bit in Florida and I let a woman teach me rhumba. I was stuck with it. She wanted to do rhumba all the time. - What happened to her? - Who? - The rhumba dancer. - Still in Florida, I guess. Why? I-I just wondered. Give him a right! Give him a right! Give it to him! Give him that right! Oh, boy! What a grip hammer! He hit him that time. Eight, nine, ten! 'An over-hand right, did it. I told you it would.' Yeah, sure it did. - Gladys, are you alright? - Oh, yes. But-- I guess, you don't like this much. Let's go. Wait, the main event's comin' up. - You stay. - Oh, no. I don't-- Come on, let's go. He's a sucker for a right hand, I could've licked him myself. Aw, shut up! Nick, honey! What are you doing out here? Just on a little vacation. Excuse me. Huh! Say, Al, what's the matter with-- Ixnay, sister! Ixnay! Come on, Lou. We're late. Who was that girl? Oh, she was a cashier in club I used to go. Can she rhumba? Look, Gladys. I've known more than one girl. I'm sure you have. 'Ladies and gentlemen.' 'The main event of the evening.' Mr. Hall, don't you simply adore Bach? Huh? Bock? Oh, yeah. Ice cold one. Nice big head on it. How about another drink before turning in? No, thank you. One highball is my limit. Lloyd, I've been giving a lot of thought to that post-war salvage setup of yours. Really? I'm afraid I've been neglecting it. Look, we're both businessmen so I'll come right out and say what I want to say plainly. I'm looking for some good solid investments for Mrs. Halvorsen. I handle her estate, you know. - Oh! I didn't realize that. - Yes. I, I don't know much about shipping business but, well, if there's any possibility You mean, you'd like to invest in our company? I'm deeply considering it. I'll tell you, Manning, we don't need any money. We're subscribed to the limit now. I'm not selling any stock. I was afraid of that, but if you could make an exception on a friendly basis, it's really for Gladys, not for myself. I'd like to accommodate you, but I have a partner in New York. I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow. I might ask him for a personal favor. - That's awfully decent of you. - That's alright. Say, Pop, Al Doyle ain't showed up but there's a good looking blonde dame lookin' for you. - Name's Toni. - Toni, heh! Send her in! Alright, come on in, sister! - Pop! - Hello, kid. You know, I've been wondering what happened to you. Nick never spills anything. Sit down. Where's Nick? I lost the address he gave me. Just got in from New York. I'm worn out! And did I have a time finding you. Take it easy. Everything's alright. 'Al Doyle'll be here in a little while.' - 'Al Doyle?' - 'Yeah.' Well, I can't wait. Have you got Nick's address? - Yeah. - Could I have it, please? - Sure. - I'm in a hurry to see Nick. He's got a house at the beach. It's quite a swanky place, too. Where you goin'? What's your hurry? You know how Nick is. If he knew I was in town-- But you may not find him. He's got a suite at Marwood Arms. I'd stay away from there. It's a heavy pitch. Sure. Sure, I understand. Pop, if you see Al Doyle, don't tell him I was here, will you? - Okay, honey. - 'I want to surprise Nick.' I'll bet you do. Toni! - Oh, hello, doc! - Hello. I haven't seen you since Miami. How's it goin'? Fine, fine. Looking for Nick? Yeah, I know where he is. Don't move in on him too fast. Might upset the apple cart. Big deal, huh? You must be in on it, too, doc, huh? In on it? Huh! I laid it in his lap. We're partners. That's great. I'll probably be seeing you. Bye, doc. What's your hurry? What about a drink? I can't stop now. Later. Come in! I got a date. Alright. So you got a date. Don't bite my head off. Looks like you lost your touch. The tie, I mean. - What do you want? - I'm on my way to see Pop. He wants to talk to me about doc. He's gettin' more and more jumpy about the deal. - Tell 'em to relax. - He's a bad boy, doc. - Not very. - Even I'm gettin' kinda jumpy. - Take an aspirin. - Look, Nick. Pop's no fool. If he's worried, there's something to worry about. Will you take my word for it? It's in the bag. Everybody's kickin' about how you're foolin' with this dame. They figure you're not bearin' down hard enough on the take. A big deal like this takes time. And don't call her a dame! You're sure you're not goin' overboard for this tomato? She'll wait. Listen to me. Doc's bad with a rough reputation, if he figures he's gettin' sold, he's gonna blow the top right off. Leave doc to me. Look at it another way. Dough's goin' like confetti. Look at this apartment. That house down at the beach. Why, all the moolah you been spendin' on this.. ...on this lady. We're gonna be stripped. It's my dough. I gotta go. You comin'? I never seen you so excited over a date. Not even Toni. That's what comes of getting mixed-up with a bunch of small-time chiselers. Always hungry, always scared. Looks like Pop conned me into a bad one. Well, it wouldn't be the first time. I'm sorry, miss. I was sure he was there. - Perhaps he's coming down. - I think I'll go up and see. I wouldn't advise that, miss. Mr. Lloyd is very particular.. Oh, there he's now. Go to the writing room, look for Mrs. Halvorsen and stall her. This deal is really gone haywire. - Hello, Nicky darling. - What do you want? That's a nice greeting. Why don't we sit down somewhere and talk? - How did you find me? - Do I have to go into detail? Look, I'm busy, I got no time. You better take time. 'You wouldn't gyp an old pal like me, would you?' I gypped you? All I did was take my dough back. Yeah. And the joint folded. - Your boyfriend ran out on you. - I ran out on him-- Get wise to yourself. We're done. You took care of that. Brush-off's not that easy. That's the sucker, huh? Nice work if you can get it. Hello, Gladys. Did I keep you waiting? No, I was having coffee. Do you mind comin' to the bar with me? Not at all. Take it easy. I can have you thrown outta here. That dame's batty about Nick. I could tell. So? Come on. Let's take a walk. I don't like this rush act, Al. You should've thought of that when you had Nick's roll. There's big dough up. Keep your nose out of this-- Or what? Nick...tell me to mind my own business if you wish, but.. ...but you were rude to that girl and that's not like you. I just didn't wanna talk to her. If I was rude, I'm, I'm sorry. Shall we get started for the beach? Yes. - But I've got a better idea. - What's that? We'll take the car, I'll drive and don't you ask any questions. Alright, I've bounced all through Italy in a jeep so why should I worry about your driving? Well, just for that, I'll run you into a tree. - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah, sure. Maybe we should have gone to the beach. No, no, this is swell. Shall we go inside? Sure, what do we do, just walk in? I guess so. The door was open, so, we just walked in. Good. Everyone is welcome. Would you like me to show you around? Well, uh...how about it, Gladys? Would you mind if we just look? Perhaps that is best. Uh, how old is this church, father? It was founded in 1776 by the three Padres Serra, Mugartegui and Amurrio. And is probably the oldest part of the mission. Well, that's very interesting. Thank you. This is for the poor box. If there's anything I can do you'll find me through that door. - Thank you, father. - Thank you. I didn't know whether to give him money. Seemed alright. Where's that singing coming from? Must be from the school building. - Didn't you notice it? - No. I wonder where that door goes to. I don't think you like the mission. I'm afraid I wasted your afternoon. I'm sorry, I, uh, let's go outside. - This is swell, isn't it? - Very beautiful. - Nick, I wanna know you. - I got to thinking of Italy. That place back there reminded me of.. ...some of the churches we saw. Except they were all wrecked. Holes in the roof.. ...statues all over the floor paintings ripped to pieces, everything smashed. - I'm sorry. - It's alright. Maybe I forgot about what we saw too easy. It's too bad people can't get along. The world's a pretty nice place, if you're happy. Are you happy? I wasn't. When? Till I met you. It seems like I've been waiting all my life for you. Ninth floor, Mrs. Halvorsen. Oh, yes, of course. - I'll see you at dinner. - Seven. Thanks. What did I tell you? I knew that was gonna happen. Yeah? Well, you don't know what I know. Hello, Blake. - What do you want? - Talk to you. I'm tired of being pushed by Al and Pop. We got nothing to talk. You must be crazy coming up here. Only way I could see you. I rinsed the clothes made a little strike with the dice. - Come on, Doc, blow. - Don't rush me. Since I'm here, listen to me. - Alright, talk fast. - The boys and I had a meeting. We are not happy with the way things are going. Thought I'll have a few words with you. Stop fooling around and get down to business. Get that dame out of your head and make that take. Look, Doc, either I'm handling this job or not. Now, if you wanna take over-- Glad you said that. A point I wanted to make. That's exactly what I wanted to-- I'll hand it over to you right now, I never wanted it anyway. Now, beat it. Suppose the boys and me hold up for another week. I've already turned it back to you. It's yours. I'm not used to operating with cheap hungry chiselers who should be in an arm racket. Big deals take time. Okay, I'll hold off. Don't pull any fast ones. - Are you threatening me? - Stay away from me, Blake. You come up with a ride, I'll make you eat it. I only use that as a last resort. Alright, Blake. Work fast. Mr. Manning. Saw the man who just left the elevator? I couldn't very well help it. When I was riding down in Florida he was a big shot gambler at the track. He was always trying to fix races. Really? What's a men like that doing at the The Marwood Arms. He was up seeing Mr. Lloyd. Ninth floor, Mr. Manning. Oh. Thanks. - Good evening, Doris. - Good evening, Mr. Manning Miss Halvorsen in? 'Charles, come in.' Where have you been? I've been trying to get you. Oh. What a beautiful orchid. Thought you could wear it to dinner. Oh, thank you. But I won't be able to dine with you. - Lloyd? - Yes. He'll be here in a minute. - Well, perhaps I-- - You could join us if you like. I don't want to intrude, but, frankly, I'm little worried. - What about? - Lloyd. Gladys, the man is a stranger. 'We're taking him at his own valuation.' 'We know absolutely nothing at all about him.' I know one thing. I'm happy. I've never been this happy in my entire life. I'll run along. Perhaps I'll see you later in the evening. Perhaps. And Charles, thank you for the beautiful orchid. Not at all. This is Mr. Manning. Would you get me the district attorney's office? - Yeah, I know, but-- - Shut up. I'll hand you the lowdown as I get to it. We're blowing as soon as I get reservations. - What about the deal? - It's off. Say something, Pop. It was your idea in the first place. Let Nick do the talking. I don't like the whole set up, I'm backing out. But Doc'll throw a fit. - I'm gonna pay him off. - Wait a minute. You mean you made the take? I'm gonna pay Doc and his boys with my own dough. Don't just sit there. This guy's off his rocker. You guaranteed those guys 30 G's, Nick. - It's a lot of dough. - I can stand it. I'm sorry about you, Pop, but I'll look after you. - As long as you pay Doc off. - Hold on, you two. Are you both crazy? Doc gets paid off. Windy and Shake get paid off, even Pop. Where do I come in? - Back to New York with me. - On what? When you get through paying them off we won't have cake money. I don't get it. Why New York? - Is the widow going with us? - No. If you're not overboard this dame, nothing makes sense. That's my business. Go to the beach, pack the stuff, pay off the houseboy. Call Doc, tell him to meet me at the Coast Cafe tonight at eight o' clock. Wait. Alright, the deals washed up, but don't be a sucker. Why pay off them broken down tramps? We'll just blow. Do I have to answer that one, Pop? Listen, he's got to pay off. He's too big a guy to welch on a deal. And besides if he don't pay off Doc'll take over and he'll never let up on the widow and Manning. Correct. I got things to look after. Can you figure a guy loving a dame 30 G's worth and then not even getting it. It just don't make sense. Not to us. Why didn't you talk to him, Pop. He listens to you. I think I talked to him too much already. I wished I'd had the sense to do what he's doing 30 years ago. 'What is it, Charles?' Gladys, I.. - I just don't know how-- - Charles. Please stop stammering and say whatever it is you want to say. This is very difficult. Well, I found out that Mr. Lloyd is not all that he's supposed to be. What do you mean? I'm afraid he's a swindler. Oh. That's ridiculous. Charles, how can you be so silly? I found it hard to believe too. I talked to him on the phone. Told him I had a check made out. He'll be up, now. Are you telling me he wants to sell us worthless stocks? Yes. His real name is Nick Blake. He's a notorious confidence man, I'll prove it to you. Charles. How can you believe such an absurd story? 'Come in.' Hello, Manning. Gladys. I tried to call you. Charles asked me to come over. Just as well. I got some bad news today. Oh, what's wrong. Well, we can't accept your money. Things aren't going very well in our company. I wouldn't recommend an investment at this time. At least not till I fly back and investigate. Oh, Nick. - Will you be gone long? - Not long, I hope. Well, this is very disappointing. Good investments are so hard to find now. - Maybe after you investigate-- - I couldn't make any promises. If I don't like the looks of things, myself, I may withdraw. Gladys, I'm sorry about our date. - Will I see you before you go? - Of course. Will you meet me in the bar at five? - So long, Manning. - 'Goodbye, Lloyd.' Well, Charles. Mrs. Halvorsen, Mr. Johnson, district attorney's office. - Oh, how do you do? - How do you do? 'That was Nick Blake, alright.' Oh, no. You must have made a mistake. Oh, no mistake, Mrs. Halvorsen. - Well, then, arrest him. - On what charge? He's committed no crime and not wanted by the law. He didn't take your money, he refused it. But how can the police let him run loose? What can I do? He always has plenty of money, best lawyers. 'Nobody's ever been able to get an indictment against him.' 'He generally takes prominent people and they hate to admit' 'they've been suckers of.' 'Oh, of course, you're too smart for him, Mr. Manning.' 'Keep in touch. If he makes a move, let me know.' - 'Good afternoon.' - 'Good afternoon.' I want all my stuff checked to the Union Station. I wanna be out before four o' clock. Come in. Yeah, thanks. - Gladys. - I couldn't wait until five. Anything wrong? Nick, tell me the truth. Is your name Blake? Yes. Who told you? Charles and a man from the district attorney's office. But I just can't believe it. Well, take it from me, it's true. Then you didn't intend to meet me at five. - No. - But, Nick, you-- Oh, there's so many things that I don't understand. Just forget the whole business. Nobody's hurt. I might as well say goodbye now. I just can't say goodbye like this. You say that nobody's hurt. I am. But you could have been hurt worse. I'm a guy trying to take your dough. You didn't take it when Charles offered. I figured the longer I kidded Manning, the bigger the take. You refused the money on my account, didn't you? 'Because after that day at Capistrano you just couldn't--' What's the difference? We're a 100 to one shot. We're two different kinds of people. Go home. Be with those you know. You'll forget everything. I don't wanna. I love you. You can start all over again. - People like me don't change. - You have changed. What does it matter what you were? We love each other. I suppose I should have realized. That was also a part of the deal. No, it wasn't. Believe me, it wasn't. I love you. Hello, Al. 'Say, where did you come from?' The door was unlocked and I walked right in. 'What do you look so happy about?' It's a good thing Nick's not here, you walking in like this. I got a good mind to bounce you, but I don't feel like it. Want to cry on my shoulder? How's the big deal going? Or should I ask? It's not going. It has went. If I had a piece of rope, I'd hang myself. - You kiddin'? - Yeah, yeah, ha ha. I'm laughin' myself sick. Those square-johns in the army did it. Nick's all washed up. First he falls for that dame, then he won't chip nobody because it's against his principle or something. Okay if that's the way he feels. But he don't have to pay off with our dough. Even Pop gives up. He-- You talk, Al, but you don't say anything. I said a mouthful. If you're too dumb to catch on, well-- I came all the way out here from the Main Stem for what? The ride. That's what. Now, we're going back. C.O.D. You mean, Nick is gonna pay off Doc and his boys. 'That's it. With our dough.' Doesn't make sense. You say he's crazy about this dame? Hmm. Nick's got a fortune in his hand. But he don't wanna split with Doc and the boys. So he pays off, he's in the clear and he's got the widow. I saw her, you know. She's not hard to take. She's batty about Nicky, even you must have seen that. So, he and the widow beat it east. He marries her, they live happily ever after with a couple of million bucks to kick around. Say-- I know Nick from every angle. Maybe, he can kid you, but not me. Nick paying off with his dough and passing up a couple of million bucks. Uh-huh. That guy hasn't been overseas that long. Maybe, you got something there. Wait a minute. Sit down, Toni. I haven't got time. I can't wait to see Doc's face when he hears about this. - Goodbye, Al. - Hey, wait a minute. Where's Windy and Shake? I could handle this alone. Didn't Al tell you I was gonna pay off. Call and tell them to come and get it. I'll wait 15 minutes. Funny thing, you not trusting me. - I had to trust you all along. - What's this? Spit it out. First of all, tell me about the take. How was it? Tough? I got nothing to say. I guaranteed 30 percent of a 100 G's. I got it here. If you want, call the boys. I'm in no hurry, but you know how Al, Windy and Shake are. A hundred bucks is everything in the world to them. They'd let you pay 'em off. Quit stalling, what are you trying to say? That guarantee doesn't mean a thing. We don't know how much the take is? - I'm telling you. - I'm not doubting your word. But I've got a feeling that you didn't make any take. You're paying us off to get rid of us. Do you want the 30 G's? That's all you'll get. Blake, I played around when you were wasting time showing that dame around, doing nothing else. Well, now, I'm done playing-- Last time, do you want the money? Yes or no? Sit down. I've got a rod on you. You're through running over everybody, Blake. - I call the turn. - Call it fast. I know everything. Don't think you'll pay me in chicken feed marry two million and live in trover forever. You're really blowing your top. We figure the widow for two million. 30 percent of that is 600 G's. That's what you owe us. 600 G's. - Is that all? - 'I know it's a lot.' 'You'll pay 50 G's at a time.' Supposing I don't play ball. You wouldn't be so dumb. You'll have plenty. Of course, if something happened to you an accident, maybe. I'll have to take the deal over one way 'or the other. And I play very rough.' I get you, Doc. This takes a little figuring. Alright, on your feet You're all washed up, Doc. I was gonna pay you off. Now you don't get a red cent. If you ever cross me again, I'll bump you. Now, beat it. Okay, Blake. Right now you're holding the best hand but there maybe a new deal-- Get going. You don't have to save face with me. Well? - Blew up higher than a kite. - I was afraid of that. - What happened? - I got no time to talk now. When Doc comes, you guys follow him. I'll go to the hotel and make sure Gladys is alright. There's something about this that bothers me. If you find out anything, call me at the hotel. I knew this deal was a bad one. Come on, let's shove off. I'll drive. I know the roads better than you do. Nine-0-one. Well, then, try nine-0-nine. Well, never mind, thanks. - Where's Gladys? - I was about to ask you that. - You can't find her? - That's what I mean. - If you know anything-- - Take it easy. I want to find her as bad as you. I understand you're looking for Mrs. Halvorsen. I was just out-- - Where is she? - She left with a man. A complete stranger to me. About 20 minutes ago. What did he look like? He was a very big man, Mr. Lloyd. - He spoke with a raspy voice. - Okay, thanks. Manning, this is bad and you got to help me. Stick here. If Al or Pop calls I'm on my way to the El Dorado hotel. - But who-- - Al or Pop. El Dorado. - Well, he's going home alright. - Yeah. Doc's getting kind of impatient. Looks like there's something up. Maybe Doc just came back to get Windy and Shake. Nick's probably dreaming. He's so crazy about that dame. Yeah, Nick generally knows what he's talking about. - Well? - It's a cinch. She fell for it just like that. She knows Nick's a racket guy and thinks we're his chums. Okay, then, let's go. - The dame. The sucker. - Now, Doc's really done it. - Oh, where's Nick? - I'll take you to him. Little matter came up, Mrs. Halvorsen and he wants to see you. And this is the best way to do it. - Get out, I'm gonna follow him. - But-- Wait in the diner till I call, no matter how long. Try and get in touch with Nick. Come on, get out. How long ago did you say he left? Thanks. A cup of java, buddy. - Are we going to the beach? - Yeah, that's right. I wonder why Nick didn't call me himself. - Nothing's happened to him? - Oh, no, he's okay. Another java, buddy. 'I'll be right back.' If there's a call for Al, hold it. Al. Nick! They grabbed her off. - Come on. Where'd they go? - Take it easy. Pop's said he'd phone me at the diner. - What am I to do? Wait? - What else? Doc sure has signed his death warrant this trip. This thing is like a license to steal. Don't it ever pay off? Sure. In a way nobody's making you play it. Another java, pal. I hate the word, "java" and being called "buddy" and "pal." I just can't stand it, I can't.. Joe's Diner. No, he ain't here. - Who did they want? - Some guy named Horace. Hey, that's me. I thought you meant we were going to the beach house. - Where are we going? - Just relax, lady. Can I use your phone? Java, pal. Hello. Yeah, Pop. Gotcha. Beach road. Right. Sit tight, very tight. Let's go. Hey, hey, who's paying for all that coffee? Take it out of the machine, it ain't paid off yet. Oh, boy! - Could I have another shot? - Sure. Thanks, it's plenty. Sure hits the spot, it's getting kinda chilly out. Yeah, fog's coming in. Generally does this time of the night. Ain't you a little old for a government man? I used to be a private dick, but the young boys are in the army. That's right. When things are booming around here couldn't get any help, had to do it myself. - Now, there's nothing to do. - You're gettin' old. You see.. ...is there a telephone out in the pier? No. Dan, he's the watchman. He comes in here, and uses this phone. 'Been in here half a dozen times today.' - Thanks for the coffee. - It's alright, you're welcome. Okay, Ben, guess you better get started, it's about time. Besides, you're spoiling Shake's game. You can't cheat while you're watching it. You're all rather light-hearted about this, aren't you? I've heard that kidnapping is a very serious offence. It the law gets in the picture, it is. Of course it will. You're stupid to think-- Hope you learn to behave, else we'll have to get rough. - That'd be rather silly of me. - A dame with sense. I never noticed it. Won't take long if things go right. We contact Manning, Manning contacts Blake. Knowing me pretty well, Blake won't yell copper. I'll put it this way. You're our security for a big loan. Once we get the dough, Blake and Manning gets the security. - 'That simple?' - Very. Smart fella, Doc. Okay, Ben, get going. I call Mack at the All Night Bowling Alley. I wanna reserve an alley for tomorrow afternoon in the name of Mike Finn. 'That's right, he'll do the rest. Okay.' There's another thing I like about this deal. 'If anything goes wrong' 'Blake will be nailed as the go-between.' 'Don't get all excited.' Wasn't Blake supposed to meet you at the hotel? When he got there, Manning was looking for you. He'd contact Blake and.. ...Blake would get the idea very quick. - Where's Gladys? - They've got her in that shack. - Got a gun? - Yeah. You? I'm all set. There's four guys there. Let's surprise them. We gotta figure an angle. She's in a tough spot. Doc can hang for this. You can only hang him once. I never thought of that. - Do they know they're followed? - No. They think they're safe. Gotta make contact sometime. No phone out there. - Have to come to the store. - Good. - What's the idea? - Shut up, come on. - You're the watchman? - Yeah, but he's in on it. He's been using that store phone all day. You've got company out there, haven't you? Are you kiddin'? Nobody ever comes out there. How would you like for me to dump you in there? Okay, I got company. - Is the girl alright? - She's alright. - What'd you come in for? - 'To use the phone'. We better work fast, Nick. Stay here and watch him. He should've been back by now. Maybe he's having a tough time gettin' through. Should've sent you guys, but figured since he knew the-- - Maybe he ran into trouble. - What trouble? 'Only thing that could happen is he might get run over.' That sum you're talking about is fantastic. Where could Mr. Manning raise so much money on such short notice? If you'd only trust me and forget about Nick. I was beyond the trusting stage when I six years old. Windy, take a look for that dumb cluck. - Don't you get lost. - Okay, Doc. Ow. Get goin'. Underneath the pier. Don't let me tell you twice. Sit still, Windy. The tide's comin' in. I'm gettin' my feet all wet. What would you rather have? Wet feet or no feet? - See anything? - No, not a thing. Still foggy. - Doc, I got a feeling. - Psychic, eh. A chill running down my spine tellin' this one's going wrong. - If you'd only listen to me. - 'Don't you start arguing.' - Go outside and look. - Can't see a thing-- - What are you afraid of? Ghost? - It's funny nobody's come back. Keep your eyes on her. I'll take a look. Shake, maybe you'd listen-- Don't bother me. I got troubles of my own. I was beginning to figure you was lost. - What's the score, Doc? - I don't know. - Somebody's got Ben and Windy. - It's uncanny. Yeah. We've gotta make a break. - No. - Pull yourself together. We can use Ben's boat. See if you can start it. - What about-- - We'll take her. - 'Gotta come if they spot her.' - 'They won't spot her.' Wait. We didn't figure on that angle. Get outside and do as I tell you and stop trying to think. Why don't we stay here a little while longer? Maybe there was trouble putting the cold through in a remote spot like this, well.. Windy could send Ben back to tell me, couldn't he? Windy doesn't seem too intelligent. It's a good argument. I'm taking no chances. I'm flirting with the electric chair. Wait here. Help! Help! That wasn't a very smart thing to do, lady. - Drop that gun, Doc. - Nick! 'Nick!' Gladys, here, here! Nick. - I told you not to-- - I know, I know, Nick. I ain't gonna make it this time. - And it's just as well. - Take it easy. You're going home with me. Don't talk foolish. You think I'd do time at my age? I'd be an old man when I get out.. ...to see the moon.. ...see the stars. All for one dime. I guess his time was up. Nobody lives forever. That's the way he looked at it, anyway. Who was he? Just an old guy, down on his luck. He said, "Nick, life goes by so fast. You wake up one morning, and you find you're old." He was worried about us wasting time. We'll have plenty of time to dry out now.
