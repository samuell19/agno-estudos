A DUEL TALE (Hatashiai) WHAT IS HEYA-ZUMI IN THE EDO PERIOD UNLESS YOU ARE THE ELDEST SON, ALL MEN BORN IN THE FAMILY OF LOW RANKING SAMURAI HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO MARRY INTO ANOTHER FAMILY. IF HE FAILS TO DO SO, THE ONLY WAY LEFT IS FOR HIM TO BECOME A HEYA-ZUMI AND LIVE THE REST OF HIS LIFE AS A FREELOADER. - Your young brothers are as spirited as ever, Miya. But they never come near this house. I figure they are told not to by their mother. - Now boys, it's time for your calligraphy lesson. Get ready quickly. = Yes. - The chrysanthemum, I see... - Great Uncle. Great Uncle! - Huh? - When I'm done cleaning, there is something I want to talk about, okay? - What is it? - Just you wait. - Just you wait... - I'm done with the cleaning. - Oh. - The chrysanthemum bloomed beautifully. - Ah... You wanted to talk to me about your marriage arrangement, yes? - How did you figure that out? - It was easy. It is not like I am in a jail, you see? I step outside. When one steps outside, one hears rumors. Of course, Yahei has been in my face lately, so I am making a point of not going out much. - You got in trouble with my father again? - Well... Yes. Say, I saw Inspector-General Kurokawa was paying your parents a visit. He brought up a marriage arrangement with Nawate's son, I suppose? - You already knew that much? - Yes. How do you feel about this, Miya? Are you not satisfied? - I do not want this! - Well, if you do not want this, it cannot be helped. We can't force a matter like this against one's wish. - Do you really think so? - Yes... - But, you're the only one who would tell me that. My father and others, they're all for it. - I am always on your side, Miya. - Thanks. - Ah, I'm exhausted! All that tension made me dizzy. Say, why don't you come to my place. - Huh? - My sister-in-law gave me tons of hand-me-downs. They're all with great prints. I want to give you some. - Fantastic! But are you sure? - Of course. We're cousins! - This one is amazing! - This one will look great on you too. - Do you think so? - I heard you have a marriage offer. - You knew it too? - A marriage offer from Nawate Tatsunosuke-sama. I heard he's bragging to everyone that he'll have Shoji's daughter for his wife. My brother said it was arranged by Kurokawa-sama. What are you going to do? - What do you mean? - I hear he's quite a playboy. - I see... - Regardless, It's an offer from a family with a stipend of 420 koku. If I were you, I'd give them my answer in a heartbeat! - Actually, I have a confession... - "Though I would hide it, "In my face it still appears my fond, secret love." Matsuzaki Shinjiro-sama, right? - You... knew that too. - My brother says Matsuzaki-sama is a clever fellow, but he has been lovesick ever since my brother introduced you to each other. I thought so... Either way, the sooner you make your decision, the better. - Miya, I'd like to have a word with you later. - About the offer from Kurokawa-sama. - We shouldn't keep him waiting for the answer. - This offer is a rare opportunity for you. Nawate family's stipend is 420 koku. Just imagine yourself in the future..! - There's no need to think about such a distant future. These days, we cannot even predict what happens tomorrow. - Uncle, will you stay out of this? - Huh? - It's a matter concerning the Shoji family. An old heya-zumi's opinion is uncalled for! - Tatsu. - Why are you scolding me? I'm only speaking the truth. - Nonetheless, Miya, the decision is up to you. I don't think it's a bad arrangement at all, for you and for the Shoji family. - I noticed we go through the rice so quickly nowadays. I wonder if we have a huge mouse around somewhere. - Shinjiro-sama. - Miya. I missed you. - I missed you the same. - I couldn't do anything but think about you for the past few days. - Why must we always meet in secret? - A second born son like myself cannot carry the family name. And I can't marry into your family because your young brothers will carry your family name. So we can only meet in secret. I heard a strange rumor. - A rumor? - That you have a marriage offer. - It's an arrangement by Kurokawa-sama, the inspector general. Both of my parents are encouraging me to take it. - I heard it is with Nawate Tatsunosuke-dono. - Is Tatsunosuke-sama someone you know? - From my childhood. When I was a child, I used to go to a swordsmanship dojo. He is my 'Senpai' (senior) from the dojo. - Is that so. - He is a skilled swordsman, and he is from an honorable family. - Shinjiro-sama, what am I to do? - Please decline the offer. - Of course... but... - Are you hesitating? - But after I decline, what can we do? - Let's run away. Let's run and go to Edo together. I'm only a teacher now, but I have a dream. I'll give up my family rights, become a Ronin, and make a living with my writing. - Run... to Edo... That thought has never even crossed my mind. - Miya. - Good morning. - Morning... - Do I have something on my face? - Nope... - Then, why are you staring at my face like that? - Why, strangely, I couldn't sleep well last night. There were two mice hiding somewhere smacking about all night. - Great Uncle! - Today is the day Michi passed away. Won't you join me to visit her grave? Let's see now... Huh? Ah, here it is. Poor thing. It's full of weeds every time I come. Unbelievable. - Every time I visit her grave, it upsets me that they didn't bury her under a proper tombstone. Say, I never asked you. What was Michi-San like? - Huh? - You never say anything about her, so I have avoided the topic. If it's something you don't wish to talk about, I won't force you. - I became a heya-zumi after a certain incident, and my long gone brother Sobei had pity on me. - Sanosuke, what do you think? She looks like a smart girl. We gladly accept. - It's our honor, sir. - Thank you, sir. - He's not in perfect condition. Do treat him kindly. - I must have been about 30. Her name was Michi. She was the daughter of a farmer. So although we were husband and wife, we didn't get married legally. In another words, she was my mistress. The house I live in now... my brother built it for me... and Michi. I know. Michi, you should try. - No. I can't. - Give me your hand. - I'm unworthy. - That's silly talk. See, like this, in the middle. We are husband and wife, right? There, there, what are you doing? Stop that and come rest now. - I'm sorry. - In about a year since Michi came to live with me, Michi was pregnant with our first child. - Hang in there! Your baby is coming soon. Almost out! Hurry, hurry! We need some hot water. - Yes. - Get it ready. Push now. Push. - But a heya-zumi does not have the right to raise a child. - Is this your final decision? - Michi got pregnant for the second time. But her children were buried into the darkness one after another. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. - Dear... - Yes, Michi? - Though it was... for a short time, I had the pleasure of being by your side. You made me a happy woman. But... I wish... I could have raised your children... with these hands... - Michi became my wife when she was 20, and she passed away when she was 32. You see? She does not have the right to be properly joined into the Shoji family's graveyard. - But... For her to be buried under this small rock... - I will be buried under there too someday. - I'll make sure to build a proper tombstone for you. - We are all the same once we die. This suits me well. - Great Uncle, where are you going? - There is another place I want to stop by. - Another place? Ah, Great Uncle. - Here it is. POSTHUMOUS BUDDHIST NAME (Fuhouin Eihoshodoushinnyo) - Here it is. POSTHUMOUS BUDDHIST NAME (Fuhouin Eihoshodoushinnyo) - What a magnificent grave! - I am sorry. I will not let her repeat your fate. POSTHUMOUS BUDDHIST NAME (Fuhouin Eihoshodoushinnyo) Now, I am ready. - Whose grave was that? - Well, a woman I knew from my past. Do you know who the Hashikawa family are? - No. - They reside in Mitate-Cho. The grave belongs to their only daughter. She passed away one year after her husband married into her family. Her husband married a new woman. His son is the head of the Hashikawa household now. The truth is, I was arranged to marry her. - Oh my...! I've never heard this story. - I never intended to tell it. - But what happened? - When the wedding date got close, Someone forced me to a duel. I won the match, but I was badly injured. That's how I ended up with my leg in this condition. The marriage arrangement was cancelled because of that. - That's terrible! Have they no heart? But why, Great Uncle? - Huh? - Why must you visit their family grave? After they cancelled the marriage arrangement! Fine. Don't tell me if you don't want to. - Ah, don't bully me so, won't you? - Then please, may I at least ask her name? - Her name was Makiyo. Wait, no. I know. It was Makie. - What was she like? - Huh? - She must have been beautiful. - What is it? - It's a fine day. Let's take a long way home. - Hey, that's fine, but hey, Miya! Wait, Miya. Where are you going? What's the rush? Miya... Miya, wait! You should decline the marriage proposal this evening. It's been days since the visit from Kurokawa. I don't think they'll let you off so easily. - Why so, Great Uncle? - You're declining an offer from a higher ranking samurai family. It's not so simple. - Great Uncle... - Well, even if both families agreed on the deal, I hear Nawate's son is quite a hot-blooded fellow. He won't give in so easily. Which means the outcome is unavoidable. You two should hurry and come up with the money you need to run away. - Please don't talk that way. Great Uncle, are you not sad that I am leaving? - How could I not be sad? You are the only one who cares about me. Miya, - Yes? - I'll tell you one thing. You haven't see the whole world yet. The world is so much more vast. When I was young, I did not realize that. For you, I am prepared to do anything. - Great Uncle... = Mother! - Leave us alone for now! - Do you suppose something terrible is about to happen? - There will be thunder. - What!? - Shhh... - There's a storm coming? Oh my, I must get the laundry in now. - Can't you think it over? - I cannot. - You know we can't decline. Don't you realize that you're from a humble family with a stipend of 70 koku, marrying into an outranking family with a stipend of 420 koku. This is a rare offer... No, there will never be another one like this. Why are you doing this to us? Why? This is any woman's dream come true! - No matter what, I do not wish to accept it. - So, I'm telling you to give us your reason! Miya! - Tatsu, stop this now! - Are you fine with this? Can you explain this to Kurokawa-sama? - Kurokawa-sama is a bigger man than that! If we have a heart-to-heart, he'll understand, I'm sure. - What heart-to-heart? He far outranks you. Obviously, he can care less about you! - Tatsu, that's no way to talk to the head of the household! Miya, you may be excused for now. - Uncle, do you hate me? - Huh? You ask such a strange question. - Do you? The way Miya's marriage arrangement turned out, it must be your way of getting back at me. - I find you hard to approach, but I wouldn't say hate... - Then why? Shouldn't you be wishing for Miya's happiness? She's deceived by all your trickery! - I did not deceive her! - I have a bad feeling. - A bad feeling? - A feeling that a tragedy will come to this household because of a certain someone. - I've got the laundry in just in case, but it doesn't look like the storm is coming. - That woman talks as if I'm a plague. No matter what, I will not let her repeat your fate. - Declining the marriage offer with Nawate, you say? - Despite all attempts, my daughter stubbornly repeats "No." Our over spoiling her caused her not to listen to our words. Please accept my sincere apology. - Someone must have planted an idea in her head. - Planted an idea? - As I recall, your uncle lives with you as a heya-zumi. - Sanosuke, sir? He is... - I hear he treats your daughter dearly as if she was his own granddaughter. So dearly that they are often seen together. I am sure that... Sanosuke-dono, was it? He must have planted an idea in her head so she might stay by him. - No sir, I promise that is not... - Either way, I will pass the message along to Nawate. - I am much obliged, sir. - Nonetheless, this is quite an embarrassment for Nawate's son. - Uncle, Uncle... Miya, you're here again? - I neglected the cleaning chores lately. - Yasu should be cleaning this room. - She does not want to. - A maid does not have a say in that! - What is your business with Great Uncle? - I wanted to question him regarding the rumor I heard. - He has been out since noon. - He is out daily. - Great Uncle's "Go" (Japanese board game) skill has a great reputation. People keep asking him for lessons. - Don't you suppose Go is just a formality, and that he might be begging for money? - Begging for money? - It's just a rumor I heard. - No, I know he wouldn't. - Anyway, we will ask him when he returns. - Mother... - It seems you won this time. - Your Go play is impressive, Sanosuke-dono. - Now your tuition, please. - May I have another game? - Three games is your daily limit. - Yes, I know. - That worked out well. Two silvers, one, two. Coins go jingle-jingle... and here comes the rain, pitter-patter. Let's see... Where is the next lesson? Ah, that way. I skipped one. Oh joy! Three games per customer. I win the first, I lose the second on purpose for a free lesson. Then I win the third. If I win, I get two silver coins, and more lessons. It's brilliant! I impress myself! Miya...! What are you doing here without any lights on? - I was waiting for you. - Huh? - But now... I am disappointed in you! - Disappointed? - To see a samurai being carried away with gambling... It is prohibited! - What I'm doing is not gambling. I'm offering Go lessons. - I don't like you when you make such an excuse, Great Uncle! - Excuses... - I lose. May I have another match? - Three games is your daily limit. - Yes, of course. Please. - Namu Amida Butsu. (I take refuge in Amida Buddha.) - Watch your manners. - I will go find him. - Find him? But, you know where? - He told me he's visiting Sawae-sama in Kakeya Machi. - Don't bother! I've had enough. In fact, don't feed him anymore! - We can't do that! - Miya! - Miya! She turned like this because you spoiled her. We should have accepted Kurokawa-sama's offer despite her wish... - Silence! - I know Mother isn't right, but neither is Great Uncle! - It was your idea! - No, it was yours! - No way! - Hey, you are Shoji-dono's girl. Where are you going to this evening? - To Kakeya Machi. Sir... Who might you be? - "Who might you be?" That's some greeting, right fellows? - Some greeting is right! - Excuse me. - Hold right there, Miss. I see you do not know me, but I know you very well. I am Nawate's son, Tatsunosuke. In other words... I'm the poor man who was rejected by the daughter of Shoji-dono. Get it now? Right, fellows? - Go on, Nawate. - Tell her all about the heartbreak of a poor rejected man. - Nawate-sama... Please excuse me then. - Hold on, Miss. - What are you doing? I will not take an insult from you. - I don't intend to insult you, but I want to ask you something. I hear you are in a courtship with Matsuzaki in Kiyoshimachi? - What do you have to say about that? - Ahhh. So you admit it? Do you..?! - This is none of your business! - So this is Matsuzaki's girl? - What level of courtship do they have going? - Nawate, all this talk is getting nowhere. - If you like her, take her. - If you touch me, I will bite off my tongue. - That is amusing. Bite off your tongue then. Do you understand the agony of a samurai who was disgraced..?! Since I'm laughed at, I thought cutting my stomach was my only way left. I've been tormented. But, if you, the one who disgraced me bites off her tongue, I would watch you do that. Now, go on and bite..!!! - You there, what are you doing? - Great Uncle...! - You are safe now. Who are these men? Stay behind me. - Who is this old man? - He must know the girl. He's carrying a wakizashi. Not a townsman, I guess. - What do you think? Call it a day? - No. It's just getting interesting. Beat it, Gramps! - Who do you think you are, old man? - Go home, Grandpa! - Die! - Learned your lesson? - Die, Grandpa! - You are Shoji Sanosuke-dono... You...! - Tatsunosuke! - Great Uncle...! Are you okay, Great Uncle? - I'm fine. Lend me your hand. Did you see it? I've still got it. It's the skill I earned long ago. I don't lose to youngsters so easily. Of course, I am no match when I'm so outnumbered. I can't walk. - Are you okay? - Ow, ow, ow, ouch. He knew my name. Who were those men? - They are Nawate-sama and his friends. - Did you say Nawate? - You are Shoji Sanosuke-dono... You...! - I see... - That is not all... They know about Shinjiro-sama and me. - Now then... It is no longer time to be carried away by Go... Anymore... Come! Hurry! - Wait! - Now with our wedding date set, we can be a married couple. - I am so happy. - My brother is well pleased that I am marrying into the Hashikawa family. - My father too. He says the Hashikawa family can rest well assured. Not only are you well educated, you are one of the top students from Shimazaki dojo, Sanosuke-sama. - No, it's nothing. - You don't have to be so humble. - All right. A LETTER OF CHALLENGE (Hatashi Jo) - Big brother... - Don't go. - But... - He's only jealous of you and Makie-dono. Throw it away. - But as a samurai who received a letter of challenge... - What if something happens to you? You'll make Makie-dono cry. - But... I have no choice but to go. - Sanosuke! - Allow me. - Sanosuke, draw! "Under two crossed swords, "when the seconds become hours you will find yourself in hell. "To find yourself in heaven, "you must step in now swiftly." - Very regretfully, I must ask you to cancel the marriage arrangement. - He was ready for his punishment for defeating the son of a higher ranking samurai. Not to mention, that he now cannot use one of his legs... It cannot be helped. - Still... The wedding date was already set. Shoji-dono, that you did not stop Sanosuke-dono, I regret very much. Excuse me then. - Pardon me. - May I help you? - Is Sanosuke-sama home? - Sanosuke-sama? Yes, I think he is. - Would you call him for me? - Yes. You have been studying hard. - Now that I can't use my leg, I am considering becoming a Go teacher. - I see... Is that so. - So... What is it? - You have a visitor outside. - A visitor? Makie-dono! Makie-dono... I heard that you are engaged. Congratulations. - My wedding is in three days. - It was... - Sanosuke-sama... Are you not sad that we are not husband and wife? - Makie-dono... As you can see, I am no longer in perfect condition. - You are still the same Sanosuke-sama. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Sanosuke-sama. This only one life I was given. - Please be reasonable. I cannot do anything for you in my condition now. - I want to seize my own happiness. Tonight at five, I will be waiting for you by the trees on the main street. - That's... - Please run away with me. - Makie-dono...! - I will be waiting for you. He will come. - One... - I know... he will come. - Three... - Definitely, he will come. - Five... of them... There's no way I can go. - Samurai sir, I see you had quite a lot. Perhaps it's best to call it a night? - More sake! Ow! - Excuse me. - "Sanosuke-sama, "Are you not sad that we are not husband and wife?" - Stop! Don't do it. Stop! Don't, don't do it. Don't... You should forget about me. And find your happiness. "Under two crossed swords, "when the seconds become hours you will find yourself in hell. "To find yourself in heaven, "you must step in now swiftly." Big brother? - You are aware of Hashikawa Makie-dono's marriage, right? - Yes. - Have you met her since? - No, I have not. But brother, why are you bringing this up now? It has been a year since she married. - You haven't heard the news? - The news? - Yes, about Makie-dono. - No, I haven't..! - Makie-dono has... passed away. She died of a broken heart. - Broken heart? - Makie-dono became ill soon after she was married. Perhaps... it's about you. - Please, just a glance is all I ask. Please allow me to see Makie-dono. - Please consider the Hashikawa family's reputation. - I beg you, sir! - Please kindly leave! - Please, please, I beg you! Please... Just a glance! Please let me see Makie-dono... I beg you... Please... One glance is all I ask! Please allow me to see Makie-dono! I beg of you! I beg of you! - Here is another secret letter from my big brother. - How admirable of you to come in the dark. You're so manly. Please buy yourself a treat with this. - Thank you. - Who was it at this hour? - Someone delivered my forgotten belongings from my etiquette lesson. - It sounded like a child's voice. - It must be in your head, Mother. - Who was it? - I don't know. I don't understand Miya at all these days. I'll need you to have a talk with her. - I suppose... - Well then, enough with drinking. Won't you go to bed? - Wait, wait now. There's still some left. I don't want to waste it. - There you are dilly-dallying again. I can't finish cleaning the kitchen. - I know it is hard for you too. - I see... more gray hair on you. - What do I do? What do I do? Great Uncle, Great Uncle! Great Uncle, please wake up. Great Uncle! Great Uncle! - I'm up. What is it at this hour? - Shinjiro-sama was challenged... to have a duel tonight. - By whom? - Nawate Tatsunosuke-sama, that evil man. - Where? - Riverbank of Nakagawa River. - Starting time? - One thirty! - It's about to happen! - I'm worried about Shinjiro-sama. He's no match against that man! - His opponent challenged him knowing that. - That incident must have led to this trouble. Great Uncle. - There's no time! I must get ready now. - Great Uncle, you would go for us? Will you be reading Shinjiro-sama's letter? - There's no time. Just fill me in. - The samurai's pride forces him to accept. But, his chance of winning is slim. If he wins, he's ready to leave the town tonight. He says to pack my belongings and wait. - "But, if nobody knocks on your back door at 4:30, "unpack and go back to bed. "It means it's over, but no need to be sad for me." - But, I can't just wait here. I'll go too! - Don't be a fool..! This is no place for women and children..!!! As Shinjiro-dono said, pack your belongings, and wait until 4:30. Understood? Understood? - Yes. - Will I make it in time? - Are you scared, Shinjiro? Come at me! Incompetent novice! Prepare to die! - I advise you to stop this unnecessary duel. - What did you say? This is no place for an old man like you! - Then, I shall offer my assistance. - How amusing. Fine. Though it does me no good to cut down an old man! Draw! - I won't. Now come at me! Now, shall we go? Miya is waiting. - Four thirty... Shinjiro-sama! What happened? - I made it in time. He isn't wounded that badly. I know, go to the main house and fetch some ointments and cloths. He has many cuts. - Yes. - Hold him down tightly. - Yes. - Hold him down! - Yes. - Don't move! Hold him down! Miya. - Yes. I'm relieved. I truly am. - Your kind uncle saved me. If he did not come, I would be dead by now. - Nawate-sama? - Dead. - I finished him. He underestimated me, but I won't lose to a green youngster in a quick duel. - It was splendid swordplay. - Great Uncle... Thank you... very much. - Never mind that. This is not the end of it. Looks like you two are left with no option but to run away. - But, I am afraid you will be left with great trouble. - That will work itself out. There, now that he is treated, be ready to leave. - Yes. - Well then, Great Uncle... - Ah, wait a moment. Namu Amida Butsu. Namu Amida Butsu. This is the money I made from my Go lessons. It's not much. - So... You were being carried away with Go every day because... - You got it. - Great Uncle... - Thank you. - Now, leave quickly. - Yes. - Leave now. Go on. - Let's. - They must be crossing the border just about now. - Great Uncle, are you not sad that I am leaving? - Are you not sad that we are not husband and wife? - No matter what, I do not wish to accept it. Great Uncle, thank you... very much. - Dear... You made me a happy woman. - After all, whether I'm alive... or dead... it's not like it makes any difference to anyone anymore. "I, Shoji Sanosuke, while attempting to redeem my nephew's daughter Miya "received animosity from Nawate Tatsunosuke and his company "regarding an embarrassment she sustained. "I accepted a duel challenge by Tatsunosuke last night, "which resulted in my killing him. "I am ready to accept the penalty of my sin to the fullest extent, "including seppuku." (ritual suicide) Makie Michi I'm going there now. That will do, right? - Miya. Miya... Miya. Where has that girl gone to? Boys, go eat your breakfast now. Looks like a storm is coming. Heaven save me from lightning.
