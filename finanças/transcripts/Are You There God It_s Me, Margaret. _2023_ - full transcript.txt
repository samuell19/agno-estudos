All aboard, girls! Bye! - Welcome home, honey! - Hi, Daddy! Hi, Mom! -Mom! -Hi! Hi! Wait. Did you get taller? -Yes, I did. -Wow. So good. Okay. Oh, here it is. - Let's get your trunk. - Yes. I double-parked the car and they're already mad at me. -What car? -Oh, we bought a car. -We bought got a car? -Yeah! -What for? -I'll explain later. It's that big blue one right over there. In the middle of the road. Hey, lady, you kidding me? Sorry! -Sorry, we're going. One second. -There's my girl! Grandma! Ah! - Oh, God, I missed you! - Me, too! Lady, you can't stop in the middle of the street. Let's go! -I'm sorry. Promise, two more seconds. -Come on, lady. Welcome home gift. -Oh, you made this? -From scratch. -Aw! -It's cashmere. I did everything but shave the goat. - Margaret! Can you just... - Let's go, ladies. I'm so sorry. Yeah, get the bottom there. -Okay. You got it. -Here we go. Okay. -Right on, girls. -All right, here we go. -Oh, God. -Heavy. Watch out for the... -Watch out for the bike. -Oh, God. Here we go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. I would've done it. Oh, hi! I would've done it. Please, please. -Oh, my God. Amazing. -We got it. -Dad! -Hello! Oh, my goodness! -I'm so glad to see you. -Me, too! Look at that! What happened? -So, how was camp? -It was amazing. -So, you were in a play? -Yep! Oh, my God. That's incredible. -What are those boxes for? -Don't worry about that. I want to hear more about camp. What else did you learn? -What else did you do? -You're moving. -What? -Really, Mom? -Sylvia. You promised. -Oh, wow. We're moving? Look, it's... Look, we we're... She saw the boxes. -She was putting it together. -I don't think she was. -We're moving? -Okay. Just... Look, we wanted you to settle in before we sprung the news. But, um, your dad got his promotion. - Yeah. Isn't that great? - And we found - this great house. - Oh, the best house. -The best house. -Where? Well, that's the thing. We got really lucky. And... - New Jersey. - Ah... -New Jersey? -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said I'd stay out of it. We're leaving New York? Barely leaving New York. It's just on the other side of the river. But... But we're happy here. We don't need to move. No, we don't need to move but we want to move. Right? I don't. I'll have to leave all of my friends and change schools and I'll never see Grandma anymore. That is not true. Look, you're going to keep all your friends here and you're going to make more friends. And listen to this. I'm not going to work anymore. Do you know what that means? That means that I'm not going to be gone all the time. Running from class to class. God. Do you know how bad I felt about that? But you love teaching art. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do, I do, but... But this is, this is our opportunity. I'll be home now. I can be home with you every single day. I'll get involved at your school, just like all your friends' moms. And we'll have family dinners and I'll learn to cook. I know it's a lot. Can you just try to believe us? Yeah. Mmm. I love you so much. Come here. Come here. You, too. And you, Sylvia. - Sylvia. Come on. - Come on, Mom. Come on. Come on. You know you want to. Faster. Okay, okay, I'm coming, I'm coming. - There we go. - Oh, my darling. I'm never going to see you again. Oh, Jesus. -Wow. -So dramatic all the time. What are you taking her over there with the schmucks and the condos on the other side of the Hudson? But we're not going to be in a condo. And those mafia diners, where they shoot each other... God... God? Are you there, God? It's me... Margaret Simon. Um... I just wanted... Well... First, I've, I've heard a lot of great things about you. I don't want to move. I've never lived anywhere but the city, and... I... I don't want to do this. Please, I'm begging you. Just please, just stop this move from happening. Um, if... if you can't do that... Just please don't let New Jersey be too horrible. -You're gonna have to hurry up, all right? -Okay, Dad! Okay, you. You need some light. Oh, God. They smell bad? Oh, they don't smell good, honey. - You're going to be there very soon. Believe me. I'll get it. I already know your name's Margaret and you're in sixth grade. The real estate agent sent out, like, a tiny flyer about you to the whole neighborhood. It was, like, this big and it had your picture. Oh, okay. I'm Nancy. I'm in sixth grade, too. Do you want to come over to my house and run under the sprinklers with me? Oh. I don't know. You don't know? Oh, no, no, no. I just mean I'll have to ask. Um, just a second. -Mom? -Yeah? There's a girl from the neighborhood who asked if I could go under the sprinklers with her. Oh, that's great. Yeah. I need my bathing suit. Good luck finding it in here. That's all right. She can borrow one of mine. Oh, hello. Nancy Wheeler. I live in the bigger house up the street. Come on, let's go. Whose class are you in at Delano? Um... The letter said "Room 18." I'm in room 18, too! We were supposed to have Miss Phipps, but she ran off with some guy to California, so we're going to get a new teacher now. Come on. Room's upstairs. Voila. My bathing suit's over here. Um... -Here. It's clean. -Thanks. -Where should I change? -What's wrong with here? Nothing. I don't mind if you don't mind. Why would I mind? You're still flat. Um... Well, I'm already growing. See? I'm going to have a pretty big chest. You know, coming from New York, I thought you'd be a lot more grown up. Have you ever kissed a boy? You mean, like, really kiss? Like, on the lips? Yeah. Have you? Not exactly. Neither have I, but I practice a lot. You want to see? What? -Sorry. -You have to practice or else you won't be a good kisser. Ready to go? Sure. Follow the leader. Yeah, watch me. -I'm a supermodel. -Okay. -Evan, you stupid idiot! -I'm sorry. You're such a great model, by the way. Who are they? It's my dumb brother -and his stupid friend. -Hey. -Mom! -That was uncalled for. Who are you? Margaret. Um, we moved in down the street. Oh, so you're the new people? Ask your dad if he wants me to cut the lawn. Five bucks, and I trim, too. Evan! Get over here right now! - I got to go. - Dude... Got to get us more birdseed. Yeah. My name's Moose. Moose Freed. I live down the street, too. Um... Yeah, but don't forget to ask your dad about the lawn thingy. Yeah. I won't. Oh, now I got to go see Evan. Sorry you got stuck with Moose. Oh, that's okay. Anyways, listen, Margaret. I've decided I want you to join my secret club. There's three of us and I'm letting in one more. But you can't wear socks or else the others might not want you. Oh. See you later. Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret, again. It's the first day of school tomorrow. I met this girl, Nancy. I don't really know if she liked me. I think she just expected me to be different or something. Anyway, well, it did get me thinking. Maybe it is time for... things to be happening around here? Come in. Look. Anyway, just think about what I mentioned. It was in with the bathroom stuff. I found this, too, if you need it. Thanks, God. -Thanks, Mom. -Mmm-hmm. Oh, wow, look at you. Are you ready for your first day? How you feeling? It's going to be great, right? And if it's not great, first days don't count anyways. - Right? - Exactly. All right. See you later. - Bye! Bye! - Did I not unpack your socks? Oh, um, uh... I don't want socks. Why? You'll get blisters. I just don't. Okay. Oh. Oh, wait. Dad! -Hey, hey, Dad! -Yeah! -Hey. Um... -Hey. I forgot to ask you. Um, a boy named Moose asked if he can cut our lawn for five bucks. Moose? Well, tell him thanks, but no, thanks. I just got a new power mower and I'm really excited for the grass to grow. -All right. Knock 'em dead today, all right, sweetie? -Okay. -Okay. -Bye. I just need to warn you one more time about the socks. Oh, Margaret's here. Hello. Good, I thought you'd forget. Guys, this is Margaret, the one I was telling you about. -Margaret, this is Janie. -Hi, nice to meet you. -Yeah, you, too. -And this is Gretchen. -So, you're the fourth. -Yeah. Well, you're lucky we saved you a seat. Or else you'd be sitting next to Norman Fisher. Ugh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, don't look. Philip Leroy just walked in. I was praying so hard he'd be in our class. Who's Philip Leroy? Take a guess. Is that our teacher? Her? No. That's Laura Danker. Stay away from her, okay? My brother says that she goes behind the A&P with him and Moose and lets them feel her up. Good morning, class. First, let me introduce myself. I am Mr. Benedict. And I'm your new sixth grade teacher. Please complete the following sentences so we can get to know each other a little better, yeah? Now, I'll begin, just to start things off for you guys. I love that I'm finally getting to be a teacher for the first time. I hate... feeling self-conscious trying not to feel self-conscious because then you only feel more self-conscious and then you're blabbing in front of a whole bunch of kids. Um... I'm looking forward to the year with you all. Okay, uh, your turn. Pass it on. Yes. Okay. Can any of you go in here? Ugh, no. Back in the box. Okay. All right. Enough. Enough, enough, enough. -Hello? -Guess who? Oh. Sylvia, hi. Um... -Margaret's not home yet. -It's 3:32. Yeah? You said she's out at 3:15 and the walk is ten minutes. Yes, I did say that. But, well... I'm sure she'll be walking through that door any minute now. Well... Okay. I guess I'll just wait. Okay. So, how are you? I am fine. I'm good. Yes. -And how are you? -Oh, fine. I read that when you don't have any loved ones around your life expectancy drops drastically, but, you know, I've had a good run. You have. You really have. Um... Margaret is here. Just a second. -It's Grandma. -Oh. Where's the Band-Aids? Mmm. -Grandma! -Honey! How's New Jersey? Are you okay? You can tell me the truth. You know, it's actually not that bad. Well, that's great news! Wonderful news. Anyway, I was thinking that you could come visit the weekend after next. I'll get tickets to a show. You can stay overnight, we'll have a little slumber party. That could be fun, right? Oh, I'd love that. Oh, I knew you would. Great. And I'll tell your mother it was your idea. -Okay? -Okay. -Bye. Bye. -Bye, sweetheart. - Bye. - Love you. Hey, Mom, can I go Nancy's? Right now? But you just got home. I haven't even heard about your day yet. -I know, but can I go? -Can I have one word? Ugh... Uh? Is that a word? -Can I go? Bye. -Yes, yes, okay, go. -I love you. Bye! -Bye! Freddy was like, "Boom, boom, look at me!" He's like, "Make up your mind!" -She wants attention. -Obviously. I know. With her "boobala joobeelee." Hi! We were talking about Laura Danker again. Yeah. And how she got even bigger over the summer. Yeah, she looked so grown up. You know she's worn a bra since fourth grade? And I bet you a dollar she gets her period, too. Well, I know for sure someone in the school does. -How? -I always check the bins. -You know those little bins in the stall? -Mmm. All right. Let's get down to business, huh? -First of all... -Thanks. ...this secret club is a secret. Nobody tells anybody what happens here, -all right? -Duh. Second, if you want to be in the club, then you have to follow the rules. What kind of rules? Well, I don't know. I'm thinking of them. Don't rush me. Hmm. Oh, I have one. If you want to be in the club, then you have to wear a bra. I have one. If you guys get your period, you have to tell us about it. - Yes. - Immediately. Every detail. Especially how it feels. Mmm-hmm. - Ooh, mine is, we can make a Boy Book and write down the names of the boys that we like. Mmm-hmm! What about you, Margaret? What's your rule? Um... Yeah, with the Boy Books, we have to show them to each other at every meeting and we can't ever lie. All right. Let's get this party rolling. Whoo! Okay, honey. All right. Mmm. See you tomorrow. I want to get a bra. Oh. You... You think you need one? Oh, no. Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. No, I just mean that, uh... Bras are kind of a pain, so you know, why start sooner than you need to? But if you want one, we... we can get you one. Well, yeah. So you want one? Yes. I already said that. Right. Okay. Great. Well, all right. Well, then, we will do that. -This week? -Yes. Good night. Good night. Good night, my sweet. Okay. So glad that's over with, God. I'm sorry. Hold on, just a moment. Are you here for the PTA meeting? Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I'm Barbara Simon. Oh, Barbara! I'm Jan Wheeler. Nancy's mother. -I met Margaret. -Oh, oh. We're just about to get started, so please come in. -Have a seat. -Okay, thank you. -All right. -Just anywhere is fine? -Here. Just right here. -Okay, okay. Here we go. Thank you all for coming. Delano is nothing without its dedicated parents. Let's dive right in and get started the way we do every year, by forming our committees. First up, we have the Campus Improvement Committee. Any volunteers? Ooh. Okay. Oh. Wonderful. Uh-huh. Barbara, I got you. Okay. Next, the Delano Social Committee. Sure, yeah. Okay. - Okay. - Great. All right. The Fundraising Committee. Good for you, Barbara. This is going to be great. All right, pencils down. Kindly pass your worksheets forward. How'd you do, Margaret? I think I did pretty good. All right, uh... Before the bell, I want to share some news that I think will make you all very happy. Now that you all are in the sixth grade, you'll get to do a full, year-long research project. Yes! The worst. Margaret, I would like to talk to you for a moment after class. Uh-oh. What'd you do, Margaret? -Hi. -Please have a seat. So basically, I'm just having little chats with each student in advance of your research projects to answer any questions or perhaps guide you toward a topic of choice. Oh. And I read your getting-to-know-you paper. And I noticed under the "I hate" section, you wrote "religious holidays." Which I... I found curious. If you don't want to share, you don't... You don't have to, Margaret. Oh, no. It's just, um... I guess I just don't like those holidays because I don't celebrate any of them. My dad is Jewish and my mom's Christian, so instead of picking which religion I am, uh, they just decided that I wouldn't have one and I can choose when I grow up. And have you given that much thought? Not really. My grandma wants me to be Jewish. And your other grandparents want you to be Christian, I imagine. I don't know. I've never met them before. They live in Ohio. So you've never met them at all? -No. -Oh. Well, if I may suggest it, I feel like "religion" could be a very compelling research topic for you. Tickets are tenth row, dead center, very hard to get. - Tell her that. - I will. -Is she excited? -She's excited. Well, I mean, is she excited or is she just excited? She's excited. Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll let you go. Well, I'm excited! -Okay, bye. -Bye. Hey. -Hey. -What happened to the couch? Uh, it's time to turn over a new leaf. I was thinking maybe something modern? I don't know. I have to think about it. How was school? You're home a little later than usual, huh? Yeah. Hey. How come I've never met your mom or dad? Um... Well, what made you think about that? Just wondering. I mean, I know that we don't see them because they're so far away, but why don't we even talk to them? We just, we just don't. It's, uh... It's, um... It's such a long story. What do you mean? I mean, I'll tell you another time. Why can't you just tell me now? Um... I just... Look, I just... Uh... So, um... We don't see my parents because, um... They don't want to. What? My mom and dad are very, very devout Christians, and... before you were born, when your dad and I first fell in love, um, they told me that it would be very hard for them to, uh, have a... Sorry. Jewish son-in-law. They told me it would be very hard for them to have a Jewish son-in-law. And that if I wanted to marry him, that was my business, but I wouldn't be their daughter anymore. But you are their daughter. Mmm-hmm. I guess, um, what I mean is that, um... They just didn't want me in their life anymore. So, I'm not. - Mom. - It's okay. Oh, honey. It was a long time ago. I have you guys. Okay, you know what? I took Dad to the station so we could have the car because we're supposed to go shopping, remember? Remember? Bras? Whoo-hoo. Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret. I can't believe this. What kind of parents would do that? And blame it on religion? God, please take care of my mom. She's a good person. -She's nice to everyone. -You're welcome. Even when she doesn't need to be. -Thank you. -Can't forget about you. I don't know why this happened. But please, somehow, make it all okay. And here are the bras. Oh, also, I'm getting a bra today. I'd like something to put in it, please. Excuse me. Uh, we're looking for a bra for my daughter. Hmm. Well, we don't have many that small. But come with me, dear, I'll measure you. Arms up, dear. Hmm. Barely a 28. Not even a double-A. Your best bet is going to be to go with -one of these Gro-Bras here. -It's okay. So, one day, when you do grow, it'll grow with you. Okay. Thank you very much. Sure. - Thanks, we'll just go try it on. -Um... -Hmm? Oh. Yeah. Can I just... I'll just... Yep. Here we go. This is always the tough bit. I can't even do this to this day. Okay. All right. Can I see? -How's that feel? -I cannot wait to take it off. Yeah. Welcome to womanhood. Oh, hello. Hello. Look at you. Working the land. Heavy machinery, ouch. Be better if I take my shirt off or it's too much? Not for me. Ooh. There it is, yeah. You ever been kissed in the suburbs? No, sir. I'm Laura Danker. What's your name? God damn it! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Did you lose a finger? It does say, "Stop the engine motor "before cleaning the mower, unclogging the chute." Whose side are you on? Well, no, you turn off the motor before you... I'm fine. You have to turn the motor off, Dad. Well, time for Boy Books, everyone. Who wants to go first? Like it matters. We all already know who everyone put down. Philip Leroy! He's so cute. It's been the same since second grade. Well, he looks better this year. - Really? - Yes. He must have gone -to the beach or something. -He doesn't look -any different. -Who'd you put down, Margaret? Yeah, I put him, too. All right, well, that was quick. Now it's time to check for the bras. Gretchen has a bra. Janie has a bra. Margaret has a bra. Huh. Now, let's go around and tell our sizes. Well, mine didn't say it had a size. It just said it was a Gro-Bra. Yeah, I got that one, too. Oh, same here. Well, not me. I'm a 32, double-A. If you want to get out of those small bras, you're going to have to do the same exercising technique I do. - There's an exercise? - Of course there is. You hold your arms out like this and you say, "I must, I must, I must increase my bust. "I must, I must, I must increase my bust." -Does that really work? -I'm living proof. Now come on, get up. Get up! Get up! Get up! You'll see. Get up. I must, I must, I must increase my bust. I must, I must increase my bust. Chin up! We must, we must, we must increase our bust. We must, we must, we must increase our bust. "We must, we must, "we must increase our bust." Shut up! You're so stupid! - Shut up! - I can feel it working! Mom! Grandma said she'll pick you up right where you pull in. -Yes. -I don't want you to talk to anybody on the bus. -Especially men. -Right. And you find a nice seat by yourself... -Okay. Okay, Dad. -...by the bus driver. Um, excuse me, sir, this young lady, she's traveling by herself today and I was just wondering if you could keep an eye on her? - Sure, lady. - Mom, come on. Okay, good bye. Good bye. -It's going to be fun. Bye. -Bye! -Okay. Have fun. -See ya. Right there, right there! - Good. - There you go. -See ya! -Independence is good, right? Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret. I'm a little nervous, actually, about being alone, so can you just not let anything really horrible happen? Oh, good. That makes me feel a little better. You know, maybe I will do my school project on religion. I think it's finally time for me to decide what to be, God. You wouldn't mind, would you? I'll tell you all about it. And I promise I won't make any decisions without you first. ♪ I am the very model Of a modern Major-General ♪ I've information vegetable Animal, and mineral ♪ I know the kings of England ♪ And I quote The fights historical... ♪ Grandma!

I'm honestly surprised it took her so long. I told you guys that it was my idea. I just wanted to try it out. I'm going to try church, too, Mom, so don't freak out. I don't care about church. I don't want you to go to church. I don't think you should be bothering yourself with any of this stuff right now. You said that I can choose my own religion when I grow up. Yeah, when you grow up. When you're an adult. I'm almost 12. - That's almost an adult. - Honey, no. Margaret. Honey. I shouldn't have laughed. -It was funny. -I just... I don't want her to go through any of it. I don't either. But it might not be the worst thing. Think about it. What does that mean? Well... she'll go to a couple of endless services and then, she'll realize how lucky she was we never made her go. Know what got me off going to temple? -What? -Going to temple. You don't understand a word they're saying. And you sit there for a long time. Oh, honey. Oh. -What? -I am so sorry. I am... -What? -I swear I'm going to buy the furniture. This is all I need.

Oh, I was thinking five or 10,000. It shouldn't take us long. I've got some scissors right here. Okay. Promenade right. Now, single file. And that's it. Yeah! All right, great.

I see it. It's not a pleasant sight. I never want to see anyone naked, or have anyone see me naked. It's just gross. Come on. What about when you get married? Especially then. Janie, once you grow a little, you'll want the whole world to see you. Just like the girls in Playboy. What girls in Playboy? - You've never seen... - Playboy? Where would I see it? My dad gets Playboy. Wait. So you have a copy here, in this house? Well, I don't know where it is. Of course you know where it is.

Lick them with your fingers and stick it back. You got to go, you got to go. Bye! Thank you, Jan. My God, I am so excited for all of us to do this. All right, I'll just, um... - Just, just... - Okay. I'll just... Yeah, okay. Have fun. He's hilarious. How come she never talks to anybody? I don't know. Because she's too busy doing other stuff, that's why. Now, if everybody's had enough to eat, we can start the games. The games? I'll spin first. Ooh! Okay. Now, it's Janie's turn to spin. -This is a great party. -Do we have to play this game? Well then, let's play a different game, huh? I have one. It's called Two Minutes in the Closet. What's that? Well, we all get a number, and then somebody will call out, like, number six and then those two will go into the closet and, you know... Ooh! Number three. Who's number three? Somebody's got to be number three. Go ahead. Into the bathroom. Somebody get Freddy a step stool. What do you think they're doing? I'm sorry. Ooh! You're next. I pick number... 12. What? You're 12? Ooh! Nice. Sorry. Margaret, turn around. Um... So... Hi. Hey. So... So, the kiss was really good? They were pretty good kisses. Yeah. Kisses? He kissed you more than once? Like, how many times? About five, I think. I don't know. I think I lost count. I know I shouldn't be enjoying this, God, but it's just too good. Sorry, sorry, I'm going to focus. The Book of Isaiah, chapter nine, verses six and seven says, "For unto us a child is born. Unto us, a son is given "and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, "Mighty God, Everlasting Father" If only you could give me a hint, God. I'm more confused than ever. Which religion should I be? Sometimes I just wish I'd been born one way or the other. Hi, there. This is Barbara calling, from Delano Elementary School. And we're just looking for, uh... donations. Sorry. Oh, God. I didn't realize it was dinner. Okay. Bye-bye. Hi. Don't go, don't go, don't go. I can't believe you're still there. Okay. Okay. No. Jan. I just popped by to pick up your stars. Yes. Um... Uh, I've been cleaning. Come on in. Um, I'll just, uh, get the stars. Um, they're, they're almost, uh, ready. You know, I ordered furniture and, um, -they still haven't sent it. -Oh, my gosh. So crazy. Okay, stars. Um... Stars. Stars. Stars. Thank you. Oh, and don't say anything, but Deb's stars are a little lopsided. Oh. You know, yours are so good. Thank you. You think you could do her allotment, too? Just between the two of us? Sure... Yes. Ah. Thank you. You are such a doll. Well, I better get going. There's lots to do still. -I'll get the door there. -Thank you. Okay. Okay, bye. Thank you for these. Bye, Jan. Sure, anytime. Hello, girls. I'm Mrs. Webster. And I am here to speak to you today about your changing bodies. Told you this was the big sex movie. Some of you may have already begun to experience these changes. While others of you still haven't experienced a single change at all. We're going to watch a short film to learn a little bit more. All girls are unique. But sometime, between the ages of nine and 16 one very special thing happens to every girl, menstruation. Once a month, a velvety lining of blood and tissue forms in her uterus to make a warm, nutritious place for a baby to grow. If a baby is not conceived, the lining is not needed. And so, the blood is released through the vagina. That's menstruation. Who do you think will get it first? Who do you think will get it last? I honestly don't know what's taking me so long to get this dumb furniture. I guess I just want our house to look like one of those nice little houses nice little families have. Do you like these egg chairs? When did you get your period? Um... Just tell me how old you were. I... I think I was 14? That late? That's not late, actually. I mean, I had a cousin who was 16. Sixteen? Oh, my God. I'd... I'd die if I didn't get it before I was 16. Honey, you will get it exactly when you're supposed to get it. Don't worry about it. My mom got me Radio City tickets since I got all straight A's. Um, does anybody want to come? Only bad thing is, is my brother and Moose are coming. -Oh, I'll go. -Okay. I got it. Got what? My period. I just don't really understand how you got it first when I have way more than you. Well, that doesn't mean anything. -Yes, it does, Gretchen. -Okay, just tell us -how it happened. -Start from the very beginning. Well, I was sitting there at dinner eating my meatloaf and I felt something coming out of me. So I went to the bathroom, pulled down my pants and that's when I saw the blood. So I called my mom and I showed her. And she got some "sanitary napkins," as she calls them. I put one on and... Well, that's the whole thing. That's the whole thing? Just that? - I told you everything. - No. There has to be something more. My sister said that it kinda has a smell. But I haven't noticed that yet. A smell? Like what? She said it kinda smells like the monkey bars. - The monkey bars? Ugh. - Yeah. I used to love the monkey bars. But do you feel older now? Like more mature? Oh, yeah. I don't know how to explain it and you won't understand it till you get it, but I feel like everything's changed. Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret. I've never been so jealous my entire life and I hate myself for being jealous. Just please, please just let me grow and let me get my period. Let me just be normal and regular like everybody else. Just please, please, please, please, please, please, please! Amen. I don't know if I want to do this. It's fine. It's just so that we're ready. Just in case. Come on. Okay. Next in line, please. Please, God, let it be a lady. Please. Thank you. - Hey, there. - Hey. -No... -Let's just put them back. No, come on. Come on. -Oh, my God! -Oh! The Tic Tacs! -Why the Tic Tacs? -I don't know. -Everything worked out. -Oh, man. Uh, come in. -Hi. -Hey. Uh, you've got a postcard. -Oh. Thanks. -Who's in D.C.? Uh, Nancy. Uh, they went for President's Day. -Oh. -Yeah. Okay. -You want the door closed? -Yeah. Sure. "I got it"? Oh, come on! Hello? Simon residence. Sylvia speaking. Grandma? Margaret? What's wrong? I just really miss you. Oh, honey. Me, too. I'll be back next week to see the Rockettes and... maybe could I come down and stay the night like we did last time? Oh, sweetheart. I'd love to, I'd love... But I... Well... I'm going to be in Florida then. I, uh, I heard about this hotel and there's a lot of people my age there and, uh... Um, okay. Wait a minute. Wait. Um... What if you fly down to Florida and spend a few days with me? -Isn't your spring break soon? -Yeah. The end of April. Perfect! I'll still be there. I'll ask Mom and Dad. Oh, great! That's my girl. Bye, darling. Come on, come on! Front row tickets! -Front row tickets, remember? -I'm coming! Yes, coming! I'm so excited. Hi. -Hi. -Hey. -Excuse me. -Okay. Thank you. Sorry. Lefty. Oh, no, it's okay. Do you know if the waiter's anywhere? Oh. You can have mine. I didn't drink any out of it. Thanks. Hey. Do you know something I've always liked about you, Margaret? -No? -Come with me. I got to go to the bathroom. We'll be right back. Don't touch my food. You know, I've had to go since we got here... ...and then I drank, like, three 7Ups or something. Uh-huh. Oh, no. -Oh, no. -What? Oh, please. Oh, no. Nancy? Oh, no. Nancy, what's wrong? Go get my mom, Margaret. -What's going on? -Go get my mom. -Please, quick. -Let me in. Please, please just go get my mom! Okay, okay, I'll be right back. Mrs. Wheeler, Nancy's crying. She needs you. Oh, oh. All right. Nancy? -Nancy? -Oh, Mom, please help me. -Please help me. Please. -The door's locked, Nancy. I can't get in. You have to unlock it. -I can't open it, I can't. -Yes, you can, Nancy. Unlock this door. Come on. Let me in. What's going on? All right, all right, calm down. Calm down, I can't help you. Hmm? Hey, look at me. Calm down. I can't help you if you don't stop crying and talk to me. Hey. What is it? Oh. Well, all right. Um... Here. We'll just, uh... Margaret? Margaret. Would you get Nancy a pad, please from the dispenser on the wall? She got her period, sweetie. Does she always act like that? Well, it's her first time. She's just a little scared. Thank you, sweetie. All right. Yeah? All right. Well, you girls wash up. I'm going to go tell the others not to worry. Not too long now. Okay? Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret. I don't even know what to say. I'm going to Florida? -Happy birthday. -Mom. Thank you so much. Hey! -Happy birthday. -Thank you. Why do we have different seats? He said we're in groups to study different countries. Oh. Hey. Hey. Happy birthday. -Thanks. -Oh, and, uh, -I got you something. -Ow! It's a pinch to grow an inch. And you know where you need that inch. Hey. Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret. I hate Philip Leroy. I hate him. I hate Laura Danker, too! With her big boobs. "Ooh, look at me, everybody, I'm wearing a sweater." I hate Nancy. That liar! And Norman Fisher, the way that he reads with his stupid lips flapping everywhere! Please. Please, just hurry up and get me to Florida! Philip and Norman should be here. They make us do all the work. What time is your mom picking you up? Not till later. I have to go to St. Thomas for Confession first. Confession? It's just something you have to do when you're Catholic. What do you confess? Things. What kinds of things? Never mind. You're just copying straight out of the World Book. It's four words. "Germany invaded Belgium when..." So, you're still cheating. Mr. Benedict will know if you're cheating. I'm not cheating! Jeez! Quit acting like you know everything and you're so great. This has nothing to do with being great. I know all about the stuff that you do. What's that supposed to mean? I heard about you and Moose Freed. What about me and Moose Freed? Oh, how you and Evan and Moose go behind the A&P. And why would I do that? I don't know why you do it. But I know why they do it. So they can feel you up or something and you let them. You're a liar. You're lying! I'm not lying. You're just like Nancy. All you do is pick on people and make up stories. You think I don't know about you and your friends? Laura! Wait. Please! Laura! -Wait up. Please! -You think I don't know that all of you make fun of me like it's some kind of game? -It's not me. -Do you think I want to be the biggest kid in the class? How would you feel if you were to wear a bra in fourth grade and everybody called you names just because of how you looked? I don't know. Hey, wait. I really am sorry. Laura? Laura. I'm the worst person who ever lived, God. I picked on Laura Danker just because I felt mean. I don't want to be like Nancy. I don't even know if I want to be friends with her anymore. I've been looking for you, God. I looked for you in Temple, I looked for you in Church... I didn't feel you at all. Why? Why, God? Why do I only feel you when I'm alone? Yes, my child. Do you have something you'd like to confess? Um... I... I did something really awful. And... I'm really sorry. "Dear Barbara, "your letter felt like an answer to prayer. "Your father and I have been thinking about you a lot. "We're getting older and suddenly, more than anything, "we'd like to see our only daughter "and finally get to know our granddaughter, Margaret Ann." "We're flying east next week, "and we sincerely hope you'll let us visit. "Love, your mother, Mary Hutchins." So you sent them a card? I don't know why. Do you remember what it was like when they just cast you out? Yes. Do you? Because I remember. I know. I know. How they treated you was just... -I know. -How they treated me? They think you're going to hell because you married a Jew. Think about that. I... I know. Do you really, really want to open up that door? We have a good life. Yes. Yes. I... But what if this means... they've changed? And if they haven't? They're my parents. Mmm. -The only ones I got. -They are your parents. Oh, God. Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry. What's going on? Um... -Oh. -Oh, honey, um... Uh... We got a letter from, um, from my parents, from your grandparents. And they're coming to visit next week. - Next... next week? - Mmm-hmm. They're really excited to meet you. I won't be here. I'll be in Florida. I'm still going to Florida, aren't I? -Margaret, look... -No. What? I can't even go to Florida now? Come on, I don't even want to see them. I want to see Grandma. I know. I know and we will make this up to you. I promise, you will go to Florida, -just another time. -No, I don't want to go to Florida another time. Does Grandma know about this? No, not yet. We have to call her. Well, I'm not doing it. You can do it yourself. - No, of course. Of course. - Let me handle that. -No, I will... -Please let me call. Please. To this beautiful day. Just one moment. Don't eat all the cheese without me. I'm just kidding. You eat as much as you want. Depending on your cholesterol. I'm sure it's low. Simon residence. Hi, Mom. Yes. Uh... Herb? Uh, Margaret's, uh, plan to come to Florida next week isn't going to work out. I'm really sorry. Just give me the phone. Hey, Grandma. Margaret, what happened? What's going on? We... We got a letter that my other grandparents are coming. And I just really wanted to see you. Put your mother on the phone right now. - Oh, no... - It's okay. Sylvia. What the hell is going on, Barbara? Sylvia, I'm so very sorry about this and I will try and explain it another time. No. You're going to explain right now. I'm sorry, I have to... I have to go. Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret. -I'm absolutely miserable. -I am so sorry. Everything is going wrong. Everything. I'm begging you. Make something happen so that they don't come and I can still go to Florida. Please, Margaret. Even if it's fake, can you just look happy? Or at least not so unhappy? Why do you even want to see them? After everything that they did to you? Because I want them to see how great we've done. I... And how proud I am of our family. Hey! Hello. That's them. Okay. Hi! They might hug you, I don't know. Just be prepared. -Hi! -Hello! Hello. It's so nice to see you. Oh, you too, Barbara. Oh. -Hi, honey. -Oh. - This must be Margaret Ann. - Mmm-hmm. We're very glad to meet you. -Yes, we are. Yes, we are. -Me, too. Um... Bags! We'll get the bags. Um, Herb is just out, uh, with the car. - Yeah, so... Okay. - Okay. Just out here to the right. The blue car there. Yep. Hey. -Youse okay? Yeah? -Yeah. Mom, Dad, you remember Herb? -Yeah. Hello, Herb. -Hi. -How are you? -Okay. -Hi. Nice to see you. -Hello. Um, should I... I'll take this for you. Oh. All right. Okay. All right. Should I put these up? Oh, yes. Thank you. Here we are. Make yourselves comfortable. -Lovely home. -Yeah! Thank you. Yes. Uh... Okay. So, uh, Margaret, uh, can you show them to their room? And, um, I'll just get dinner started. Sure. Um, up this way. Gosh, you look just like your mom when she was your age. Um, yeah. This way. - Hi. - Hey. How are you doing? Uh... How are you doing? Um, I used up all my small talk -in the car. -Oh, God. Do they like sports? TV shows? Game shows. They used to watch game shows. Okay. Game shows, game shows. Hmm. Um, coming! Herb! Mom! Baby! Come give your mom a big hug. Oh. -Oh. Look at your little face. -Sylvia? Yeah. My mom is here. Uh, yes, she is. What's happening? Well, Margaret said she needed to see me, so we flew out from Florida. Are your parents here yet? Oh. This is Morris Binamin. Rhymes with cinnamon. - Hi. - Grandma! There's my Margaret! Oh! - Did you know? - I had no... I know. I missed you so much! I thought you were in Florida. I know. Well, Florida came to you. Uh... Mom, Dad, this is Sylvia. Herb's mom. Sylvia, this... These are my parents, Paul and Mary. Hello. Hello. We have pot roast. Sure. Mmm. - Mmm. - Oh, yeah. -Dinner is delicious, Barbara. -Oh, my God, yes. -Oh. -You have definitely improved. - It is very nice. - Thank you. Well, I have to admit it was a bit of a jolt, um, but it's nice to have everyone here together. The whole family. And Mr. Binamin. Nice to have you, too. -L'chaim. -L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim. To life! So, um, do you watch Jeopardy!? I used to braid your mama's hair when she was a little girl. Did your mom ever braid your hair? Um, yeah, she used to do it all the time. I can see she taught you how to braid with your bracelet. Yeah. Oh, there's just so much we want to get to know about you, Margaret. Twelve years is a lot to catch up on. Yeah. A long time. So, uh, we were wondering... Do you go to Sunday school? Or, uh, have you ever thought about it? -Uh... -Nope. Never. Not once. We asked Margaret the question, Sylvia. Margaret? Well, you're wasting your time because Margaret went to Temple and she's Jewish. What did you say? Excuse me. Margaret went to Temple. -Okay, Mom, you're done. -What are you talking about? Okay, that's it. Well, you left the room and they're trying to convert her. Well, Margaret has the right to be baptized if she wants to be. - Baptized? - If she wants to be. I can't believe this. I can't believe you're doing this. All right. Everyone, this discussion is over. We're her parents and this discussion is over. Yeah, you're right, it's over, because she's already Jewish. -Sylvia! -Well, in our eyes, -she's Christian. -No, no! Margaret is nothing! Margaret is not Jewish or Christian. She is no religion until she decides. Well, how can she be Jewish -if her mother is Christian? -Stop. You were never there for her. You abandoned her. What does it matter? Do you think that we wanted this? Stop it! All of you, just stop it. I don't care. I don't care anymore. It's all just so stupid, religion! Just stop fighting! I... I don't want a religion. - I don't care. I don't care! - Margaret... I don't even believe in God! Are you happy? Hmm? -I'm so sorry. I did this. -No, no, no. This is not... -I am so sorry. -No, this is not your fault. This is not your fault. Okay, this is not your fault. No, that was everybody else. That was not... -Me. -No, no, no. "Dear Mr. Benedict, "what I learned about religion is that it makes people fight. "That every religion says the same thing. "If you pray to God, he'll listen to you, "and help you, and make things better. "But I've prayed and prayed "and everything just gets worse." Okay. We'll call you. "I don't know anymore, but I think... "that maybe the truth is... "there's nobody up there. "There's nobody listening. "There's only just... "me. "Sincerely, Margaret Simon." Margaret. - Hey. - Hey. Wait. Come here. I don't really feel like talking. Yeah. I don't either. But, um, I do want to say sorry for how things went. And I know that this past year has not been easy. Want to just sit for a minute? Mmm, yeah. Good idea. It gets tiring trying so hard all the time, doesn't it? Yeah. - One, two, three. Cheese! - Cheese! Junior High! Whoo! Come on, everybody. Margaret, come on! Hey. Thanks, Mr. Benedict. You're a really good teacher. Well, I wouldn't say all that. You know, still trying to iron out some of the kinks. No, you were really good. I'm glad you felt that way. Hey. Do you want to come dance? Really? Yeah. Yes! I knew it! You basically already won. You've been going for ages. - Ages, Gretchen? - Can I please go? Gretchen, quit complaining all the time. I'm not complaining. Nancy. Come on, please? I got it! Really nice work on the shading, Daniel. Thank you. I think maybe you could put a wash here just to blend that, but I... It's beautiful. -Oh. Hey, Barbara! -Jan! It's so funny to see you. I was just gonna call you. -Oh. -Can you believe it, about the stars? -Oh, I know. -Jeez. Well, I guess everything is a fire hazard these days. Anyway, um, we're getting committees together over at the Junior High and I can think of at least three that you'd be perfect for. Oh, Jan, that sounds great and I'd love to, but, um... I don't want to. But thank you for asking me. -Yeah. -And, uh... -Have a good day! -Okay. I'm going to write you so many letters. So many letters, the mailman's going to say, "That's it! No more!" Okay. Oh. Have the best time, honey. We'll see you when you get back. See you soon, sweetie. -Have fun. -Bye. Love you. Bye! -Okay. I think this is it. -Got it? - Then we just have to... - Wait, wait, wait. -...close it. -Yeah. - Camera, camera, camera. - Oh, wait. - Yes. - All right. Okay. Now, we just have to close it. - Sides. Check the sides. - Okay, got it? - Yeah, yeah. Step on it. - Ready. Go. Oh, my God! Are you okay? Whoo. Ah. - Just kidding. - Every time. If it's there, I'll take it. - Okay. Good stuff. There it is. Almost like we've done it before. Yeah. Is it lawn day? It is. - We haven't paid him yet. - We haven't. No. And if you wanted to go into the kitchen and grab it... Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Hey. Hey, Moose. Here. Dad says thanks. Oh, thank you. Yeah. Uh, well, have a good summer. I won't be seeing you for a while. Oh, where you going? Camp. New Hampshire. Yeah. -Oh. -Leaving today. Well, have fun. Thanks. And, uh, I don't know. Maybe we can hang out when you get back? Re... Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Mom... Mom? Mom! Mom! What is it? What's wrong? I got it. I got my period. What? -I got it, right? -Yeah! Yeah. Yes. Oh, my God. I don't know why I'm crying. Oh, my goodness. Wow. -Are you okay? Yeah? -I'm fine. I'm fine. -You feel... -Yep, I'm fine. Do you have any cramping or... -No. No, no, no. No, I'm fine. -No? I can't believe this is happening to you. I don't believe it either. You're a woman! I'm a woman! Okay, um... Get down to business. -We need pads. -Yeah. -Yeah, yeah. -Yeah. I actually bought you some. -Really? -I was going to sneak them into your trunk at camp, you know, just in case. But, okay. One sec. Be right there. Okay. So... Um, this is how they work. -So you just put... -I know how to do it. I've been practicing in my room for two months. - What? - Yeah. -You have? Oh, my... -Yes. Yes. All right. Well, then, you're, um... You don't need me. Yeah. I'll be right out here. Okay. Are you still there, God? It's me, Margaret. Thanks. Thanks an awful lot.
