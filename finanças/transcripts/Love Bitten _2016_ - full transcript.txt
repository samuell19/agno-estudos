Like, you've been lovely, genuinely. - [Alex Voiceover] I have been fucking lovely. - But like, you know, Alex, it's not you. - I got you-- (Lizzy gasps) Oh, oh my. - Ah. - I'm so sorry, I must-- - No, it's fine. - [Alex Voiceover] That felt fucking amazing. God, I should've done that on purpose. - Sorry, that wasn't meant to be malicious or anything. - No, I know. - I got your toothbrush. - Thanks. - [Alex Voiceover] I should've rubbed it in shit. Oh God, I am a terrible human being. What am I doing with my life? I could be a villain. (ominous organ music) I'm gonna become a vampire. (guitar strums) - Right. Didn't you have to get bitten? - I'm love bitten, Dave. I don't wanna kill for no reason, you know what I mean, I just, (guitar strumming) I want purpose. My friend once wrote this screenplay about a teenage boy who was looking for his purpose. - Did he find it? - Find what? - His purpose. - Oh, no, no, just ended with him walking into the ocean and having a wank. - Whatever floats your boat. - No, semen doesn't float, Dave. Semen doesn't float. - In all seriousness, mate, how're you actually planning on becoming a vampire? - The Dark Net. ♪ I could build you roads ♪ ♪ If you'd travel by my side ♪ - [Alex Voiceover] Yeah, here we fucking go, time to fulfill my destiny. ♪ Against mine ♪ ♪ Wrinkles in your nose ♪ ♪ Blue teeth from the cheap wine ♪ ♪ You're the only one ♪ (object moans) ♪ Who can open up my eyes mm mm ♪ - [Alex Voiceover] Yeah, right.

What are you doing? ("Ava Maria") - Yeah. Turns out being a vampire's kind of stressful, so I've decided to get some weed. - Why are you, why aren't you wearing any clothes? - 'Cause it's mortals' day. - Look, this is really weird. - Look, look, I've decided who I'm gonna hunt. - [Dave] What? - Dave, I've decided who I'm gonna hunt for blood. - Right, what, who? - White van drivers. - Alex, why are you going to hunt white van drivers? - Because they think they fucking own the roads, man, and trust me, Dave, there's really absolutely not that many people in the world that I hate, but those guys, fucking white van drivers, they are the biggest fucking, I, I can't even think of a word for them to, that is literally how much I hate them, Dave. They don't give a fuck if they cut you up or they scratch your car. What's wrong with scratching a white transit van, hmm? Be for ordinary people, Dave. You know, you, me, or, what I was. Innocent people, Dave. We have to pay a crazy premium on our insurance. Fuck white van drivers. I need a cape. - And some clothes. Alex, I, I didn't think you were actually being serious. - I need something vampiric and agile. - Alex, you got a fucking erection. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) - Fucking white van. (ominous organ music) - For just, (clears throat) for, for, for justice. For justice. (Alex growls and grunts) (Alex breathes heavily) (driver whimpers) - [Driver] My fuck. (suspenseful music) - (moans) Oh, oh, oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait, (breathing heavily) are you gay? - What? - I just, I didn't know if you wanted to go on a date or something? Instead of you killing me? - Um, uh, um, yeah, I'm not gay, so. - Have you tried? - Mate, being gay isn't a choice. - No, no, no, I know. It's just something within you that you might not realize was even there. - I didn't think white van drivers were gay. - White van drivers are normal people, you know. And I wasn't even driving.

I, I, I can't do this. - Oh. - I can't do this. So yeah, I leap in the van, and I kill the driver. And there's this other guy there, and we get talking, and um, Um, I fucked him. - You... - Up, I fucked him up, pff, big time. (laughs sardonically) There was, there was a lot of blood. Uh, um, but I think what I'm trying to gun towards, why I invited you here, Lizzy, is, so I've got a lot of my own shit that I've got to deal with at the moment. - Alex-- - And this whole vampire thing, I mean, it's a crowd splitter, I'll be honest. I mean, Dave doesn't like it, but you never really liked Dave anyway, did you? So, I mean, if you're on board, it'd be kind of like me and you versus Dave in a weird sort of, no, no, no, what, I think what I'm trying to say, Lizzie, is I wouldn't blame you if you, you know, wanted to change your mind, about us, getting back together. - Alex, you killed a guy. - Yeah, yeah, yeah I did. - And you thought that would impress me, genuinely. - Well, I. Oh, the fucking hot. - Yes, Alex, it is fucking hot. Who the fuck are you, Alex? - I'm trying to think about what I've learned from all of this. The answer is probably nothing. (gentle guitar music) Although now Lizzie hates me it's easier to move on. It's funny how things work out like that. (brief suspenseful music) (sighs) (gentle guitar music) This is it.
