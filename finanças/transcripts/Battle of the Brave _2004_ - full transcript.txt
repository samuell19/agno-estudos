Marie-Loup. Acoona! Acoona! France! Come. Acoona! Come, my love. Come. Acoona! Acoona! Acoona! Acoona. What can I do to forget? Don't even try. If you forget her, that means she died for nothing. I'd rather not think about her anymore. Then it would stop hurting. That's not the way it works. How does it work? You can keep Acoona alive in your heart. That way you can talk to her... ...and tell her how sad you feel. Sometimes I feel angry with her. You can tell her that too. She'll understand. I love it when we talk like this. So do I. When you were in my tummy... ...you and I, we were the same. And then, when you were born... ...you became someone else. Did I make you feel sad? At first... ...because I didn't know I could feel even closer to you... ...like now. I love you so much. To be honest, monsieur, only yesterday... ...l'd have lent half an ear to Monsieur de Vaudreuil's request. But the news I received early this morning... ...has thrown another light on your undertaking. News from Canada, madame? A defeat for our troops at the gates of Quebec. And glory for General Wolfe. Posthumous glory. Apparently, he recited a poem on the battlefield. - You're very silent. - Yes. I'm thinking of the people I left behind. Waging two wars at once... ...one in Europe and the other one in America. People in Quebec may not realize it... ...but the financial situation in France... ...has been put under dire pressure with times as they are. I'm sure it has. I can't make head or tail of England's calculations. They're spending more money tearing Canada from us by force... ...than the colony will ever bring in. And our spies inform us that they're preparing another attack. Madame, it's not too late to save Nouvelle-France. Military reinforcements are not the only solution. There is another way that is just as crucial. Dismiss the crooks and the bunglers governing the colony immediately. Eliminate the bunglers... ...from the positions of power. Sheer genocide. Seriously, monsieur... ...I know for a fact that our garrison in Montreal... ...can hold out indefinitely against English provocations. The English. For a long time, I believe they were Canada's main enemies. They're the most visible, that's for sure... ...which makes them the least dangerous. I'm very grateful to you for pointing this out to me. My compliments, madame. My brothers and sisters... ...my friends. The war is over. Governor Vaudreuil has signed the colony's surrender in Montreal. The English have pledged their word... ...to respect the inhabitants' rights to their property and their goods. The Catholic religion may be worshipped freely... ...and the inhabitants can gather in churches... ...and receive the sacraments... ...with nothing to fear. In exchange... ...the mission of the clergy... ...is to promote good relations with the conquerors... ...and respect for their authority. Nouvelle-France... ...is no more. Francois Aren't you going to bed? I'm not sleepy. Because of Fran?ois? Do you still talk to him? In your heart, I mean. No. I've stopped talking to him. I'm doing everything I can to forget him. Doesn't seem to be working. If I could go back inside your tummy all tiny again, I would. Then, you'd never feel lonely anymore. And we could start all over again. Have we fallen out? Why don't you come to warm my bed anymore? Happy New Year! - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year, Maman. He's not for us. You don't seem to be in a party mood. Here. Something for you. He needs looking after as well. I don't like cats. I know you still think of him. You've lost your lover... ...and I've lost my best friend. He can't be alive anymore. Otherwise, we'd have heard from him. There's no other explanation. Let me take care of you. Marry me. I'll talk to your father. Say what you have to say, Xavier Maillard. But I warn you, the pittance you earn... ...pen-pushing for the English is not enough to support a family. So if this is about my daughter, my answer is no. You're right. I'm going to ask you for her hand... ...but your answer will be yes. You drink and you live a wild life. Giving you my daughter will disgrace my name. Miller Carignan's reputation. Tell me about it. Bigot and his henchmen have been thrown into the Bastille. Did you know that? Your name has come up in several statements... ...along with your associate, old Le Gardeur. It would be a real shame... ...if those documents started circulating in Quebec. Right? Times are hard... ...my friend. About her dowry... ...it's not the moment to be greedy. You're not gonna marry him, are you? Life is hard in this country... ...especially for a woman on her own. You'll be leaving home in a few years' time. Don't deny it, I know you will. - But I don't wanna be on my own. - But you'll be on your own with him. You frighten me sometimes. You're growing up too fast. Not fast enough to stop you from doing something silly. Marie Madeleine Joseph Suzanne Carignan... ...do you take Xavier Thomas Maillard as your lawful wedded husband... ...and promise to love... ...cherish... ...and obey him before God? If you consent, say: "I do." Yes, I do. God. You're beautiful. I've wanted you for so long, Marie. And you knew it. I'm capable of loving you truly. And you, Marie... ...are you willing to be mine forever? If you want me, you'll have to make me yours first. I was so afraid you'd forget me. You made me lose count. So the savages didn't keep you? They can't be as stupid as they seem. All that for the hog? It's a good price. Except you'll take half of it off me. I must have been drunk when I signed that damn contract. Keep the lot for all I care. You drink too much. We can't go on like this. We must separate. We should never have gotten married. I don't love you. I've never loved you. We'll go and see the priest. He'll understand. Marie-Loup. For the love of God... ...what's happened? - Don't touch me. - Oh, no. Calm down, Marie-Loup. - Did Maillard do that? - Surprised? At least he didn't strike me in the back. What do you mean? He came to see me. He's been looking everywhere for you. He said you've refused him his rights for months. Yes, I have. He disgusts me. - Conjugal duty is sacred, my child. - I'm not your child! Isn't your own sin mortal? I've known you all my life. You've baptized me. But you took advantage of my ignorance. You lied to me. Lied blatantly. Here! In front of the altar! Before God! So he's come back. Forgive me. Forgiving you won't wipe out the harm you've done. I want a separation... ...and my share of the property back. - You'll help me. - I don't have that right. Resign yourself, Marie-Loup. Maillard has his faults, but he is your husband. - You must obey and respect him. - Go to hell, Father! Father Blondeau lent it to me. I can only understand half of it but that doesn't matter. Just half makes me want to fly up and away. Does it hurt? I'm going to tell you a secret. A real secret. He's come back. Fran?ois? He's asked me to go away with him... ...and to bring you with us, if you like. Why did he say that? Of course I want to. We'll meet him tomorrow. Don't tell anyone. Not even Grandma. And pack your things. We won't be back for a long time. What about Xavier? - Won't he stop us? - Fran?ois will cut through the woods. We'll wait for him at L'Anse-aux-Rochers. Well... ...we'll wait for him here. You'll never have the Carignan girl. The wolves are all you're good for now. You're dead meat! Leave. Now. If you ever come back, I'll kill you. You will never see your handsome lover again. - Cuckold's honor. - What did you say? You heard me. - Leave! - Go away! Go away! Filthy little brat. I hate you both. You'll pay for this. Marie-Loup? It's me. M?lodie. So... ...he was found dead in the stable... ...with head wounds. Blows from the horse's hooves, maybe. - You weren't there? - No. Maillard was blind drunk yesterday. You can see the result. I was scared he'd start again... ...so I came to spend the night here with my daughter. I found this in your house. I couldn't ask for your permission as you weren't there. - It's his hair. - It looks like it. But if your husband died in the stable... ...who brought this into the house? That's what I'd like to know. If it's not inconvenient for you, Monsieur Carignan... ...I'll have the body brought here for the wake. I've put her to bed. We've got to do something. The children have been shouting terrible things at her. They even threw stones at her. M?lodie. Can you do me a favor? Anything you like. Go get my aunt at the hospice. The nun, you know her. Tell her I need her. - It's urgent. - Don't worry. They say you slept with the devil to have me. And that's just a start. People are so cruel. I love you. - Thank you. - Anytime. Come, my angel. You'll be fine. You'll see. My poor child. We've got to think about you now. There are prayers against wickedness... ...but I don't know any against stupidity. They've turned on me as if I was a stranger. - But I'm one of them. - Oh, no, you're not. You're from very different stock. They've accused your father of killing your husband. We've got to do something. You have no right to do this. He didn't do anything. It was an accident. Are you Marie, the late Xavier Maillard's widow? You're charged with aiding and abetting your late husband's murder. Carry on. Make him see sense. Because you're wearing their uniform, it doesn't mean you're not one of us. No. No. No. No. I saw them leaving the mill at sunup. Whom did you see leaving? Him. With her. Even though they were hurrying so no one would see them. You saw them leave together. Then what? I saw them come back, right after they'd done their dirty work. Did you see the accused carrying out what you call "their dirty work"? How could I? I was in the mill. The jury will disregard that last declaration of the witness. Mademoiselle Grandjean, can you give us any facts... ...to prove that the defendants intended to harm Monsieur Maillard? Harm him? They wanted to do him in. The day before, Marie-Loup came around... ...whining that her husband had beaten her up. I heard him with my own eyes. We got on all right. I'm talking about an intimate relationship. The groom, Dieudonn?, says in his statement... ...that he saw you, and these are his exact words: "Do the beast with two backs in the barn, with Monsieur Maillard." It was just to help him. He thought he couldn't do it anymore... ...because the witch had cast a spell on his private parts. The witch? What witch? Over there! The she-devil. That's how she does it! She stares at us with those white eyes of hers. No. No. Stop her. Don't... Don't let her. She sets my blood boiling! Good God. Thank you. What for? You asked to see me. I came with the secret hope that you'd forgiven me. Hope? I have no more hope. I'm ready to hear your confession. Well, I'm not ready to confess. It was an excuse to get you here. Can I ask you to give this to the mother superior at the home? It's for my daughter. Nobody knows she's there. You know how sensitive she is. She must be kept away from all these horrors. Confession is not the most important thing. You just have to say you are sorry from your heart... ...and I can give you your absolution. You think I've killed him too. That's not for me to say. Thank God. But why does your father refuse to speak? His testimony could change everything. If only you could make him see sense. What does it mean, "Make him see sense"? The less he says the better. I'd rather he stay stubborn as a mule. I don't understand you, Marie-Loup. Good. - Is that a prayer book, France? - Yes, aunt. Read me one, then. "She was from a world where the greatest beauty... ...has the harshest destiny. She was a rose, living like a rose... ...for a brief morning." That's not really a prayer. Yes, aunt. When God hears that, it makes him think. He's not the only one. Here. It's for you. They claim that the victim's wounds... ...were caused when his horse trampled on him. It's possible, but highly unlikely. In my opinion, the wounds were caused by a sharp instrument. An ax, for instance. Fran?ois. This is incredible. I thought you were dead. And you could be too, if your face is anything to go by. I don't wanna bother you. But to be quite honest... ...I don't know anyone in Quebec now. Can you help me? - You still love her? - Yes. I still love her. Yes. Have you asked to see the judge? Do you think he'd receive me? I need someone to speak for me. I know someone who could influence the court. - Who? - Gouverneur Murray. But we must take you in hand first and we'll have to move fast. You don't have much time left to help her. We can't hear you. Speak louder. She came in and woke me up at dawn. She said something bad had happened. She wanted me to go and see. You went to her house with her? We went to see Maillard... ...in the stables. He was dead. I'm sure of it. But not cold. And what did you do next? We went back to the mill. Marie-Loup... ...was afraid people would think she'd killed him. So... ...she asked me to... What? Speak louder, please. Did your daughter lead you to believe... ...that she was responsible for the death of her husband? I can't say. I asked her: "What really happened?" And she said: "He had it coming. He got what he deserved." One can never be too careful. I understand you wanted to shed some light on a certain case. Yes. It's about Marie Carignan. The woman is innocent. Innocent? Isn't that rather a contradiction in terms? This will surprise you, contrary to popular opinion... ...I don't believe the defendant is guilty. And you're right. Maillard and a man called Lavigueur... ...ambushed me in the woods behind the mill. I fought back... ...and I left Lavigueur's body there with my dagger in his belly. I wounded Maillard but he got away. So I followed him and I finished him off in his stable. You see. Why wasn't the judge informed? I've always wanted to know who this dagger belonged to. Thank you. Been looking for a reason to get you out of Quebec... ...and now you've served me one up on a plate. You deserve to go to the gallows... ...with the wretch you're willing to sacrifice everything for. A short spell in Salieres penal colony... ...will help you think straight... ...and forget her. What happens to me... ...doesn't matter. You're a gentleman, Gouverneur Murray. You can't hang a woman when she's innocent. We brought peace when we got rid of the French. We have the clergy to thank for part of it. For reasons I don't know... ...the Episcopal authorities are favorable... ...to the witch being condemned. The life of an illiterate little Canadian girl... ...is a negligible price to pay for the Church's collaboration... ...with the state policies, wouldn't you say? Take him down! - Guilty of the charge of murder. Therefore, the court sentences her... ...to be locked in an iron cage... ...and hung by the neck... ...at the close of day until she dies. Silence in the court. Does the accused have anything to say? Yes, Your Honor. My father spoke the truth. I killed my husband, Xavier Maillard... ...to put an end to his brutality. May justice be done. Why do you care so much? This little peasant means nothing to you. She has three days left to live. She's confessed to her crime. She only confessed after she's been tried and found guilty. What did she have to gain by it? Why break a silence that leaves room for doubt? Feminine logic has never been one of my strong points, madam. Nevertheless, I've disliked this trial from the start. - I'm in a hurry to turn the page. - Does that mean...? Three minutes to say goodbye. That's two minutes too many. Put them down on my account, will you? - No, Maman! - France. I beg you, Marie-Loup. You'll die in a state of mortal sin. For the love of God, my child... ...confess. I can't. I can't. Why... ...did she refuse absolution? Why? But she's not here. And no one can answer... ...in her place. No one. I can. Make one sound... ...and I'll kill you. So it was you, my poor child. Now... ...I can die knowing the truth. Your mother protected you... ...all the way to the gallows. Pray to God to save... ...a little place for me... ...up there... ...at her side. Marie... ...I hear your voice in the whisper of the wind... ...the murmur of the river... ...and the song of the birds. You're in my heart forever. The wonder will never fade. Did you say something, Father? No, nothing. I talk to her too... ...every day the good Lord gives us.
