Ripped, corrected and synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Mrs. Hanna Belkacem? Good news. You're compatible with your brother. Your test results are positive. The kidney transplant can be done rapidly. Now it's up to you to decide... - If you still want to. - Yes. Wait. Take the time to think it over. It's a major operation. You don't have to decide right away. I agree. Fine, I'll pass on your file to Dr. Martin. He's an excellent doctor. I'm sure everything will be fine. Thank you. I'm incapable of hurting people. That's my problem. Sandrine? Sandrine Delivet? It's me, Paul. Paul! From 8th grade. Remember the trip to London? Oh, yes. We nearly slept together. - Yes. - How are you? Uh, fine. And you? Fine. Hang on, excuse me. It's Pauline, my sister. Hello? This will amuse her. Yes, Pauline? You know what? There's... Alright. Well then, I'm on my way. - Are you all right? - My mother's dead. How terrible. She was run over by a car. Oh, how terrible. Yes, it is terrible. Thanks for coming with me! I couldn't face going alone. You can kiss her if you want. I'd like that. I wouldn't have recognized you. So, you went to London? You had mono. - Mono? - Yes, Paul caught the kissing disease. He told the doctor he hadn't kissed anyone! Isn't he secretive? It really made Mom laugh! My, how she laughed! She loved to laugh! Sorry. How are your parents? Just fine. - What did they do? - A pizzeria. Yes. No, they were dentists. Yes, they were dentists, too. Paul, she's not Sandrine. Excuse me, but who are you? I'm Hanna Belkacem. How can you do this to us? - It's terrible, we've lost our mother. - I know. - You took advantage of us. - Have you no shame? I know, I... I'm sorry... I didn't realize... I didn't... Sorry, excuse me. The last train is in 10 minutes. Thank you... Just who are you? I'm nobody. I feel so guilty. How can I make it up to you? Oh, sorry! Sorry! I'M ALL YOURS I suffer from "kindness neurosis". It runs in the family. Here... Can you do another one? You've got lots and lots! - There. - Thanks. Hello, Omar. Can I leave her - while I get her brother? - Sure. - Thank you. - No, thank you. - See you later. - Bye. See you later. Thanks a million. Dad was a social grocer. He offered lots of extra services: taxi driver, mechanic, stonemason... - No, that one! - That one? Look at them all. There you are. - That's fine. - Thank you. It stressed him out when he couldn't help the customers. His store was busy, but we were broke. He didn't want to bother people with paying. - I have no change. - Thanks. Next time. Do you have a coin for the parking meter? It's a perfectly legitimate reaction. Don't worry. My mother was a home shrink. She studied, but thought psychoanalysis was for rich people and that the rich had no real problems. She decided to psychoanalyze without their knowing neighbors who suffered but thought shrinks were for nuts. - No, here is better. - Think so? - Yes! - Alright, then. Yes, that is better. - How are you? - Oh, I'm not at all well. - Oh? - I lost a tooth. - Really? - Yesterday. I was so upset. Give me a kiss. Here we go. Like Dad with his customers, my parents tried to meet my desires. - Need some help? - No. What do you want to wear for school? I already told you. I said this. Oh, alright. Guy chose the sun. Hanna, what about you? I had it first! I'm sorry, but I had it first. Guy chose it. - No, I did. - You chose it? Yes, I did! Mommy! After this trauma, my parents kept me home till primary school. - Are you all right, honey? - I'm bored. What'd you like? A little brother. So, I was convinced my brother had been conceived for me. Are you all right? We're going to the maternity. We'll be back with your little brother. - Know where he comes out? - No. My vulva. If he can't, they'll open my belly with a scalpel. You must tell kids the truth. Yes. - Right? - Can I come? It's completely normal. It's a contraction. It's natural. He's almost out. Tell me when you see the head. Can you see it? That's it. - Could take a while. - Go get the book of names. In my bag. While I give birth, Hanna can choose the name. What do you think? - Would you like that? - All right. Come on. Diego? Diego, no. Didier? No. Dominique? Dalbert? Damien? Doug? Doug is funny. Donnadieu? Yes. Believe me? Donnadieu was the most important thing I'd obtained. No, I don't believe you. - You do! - No. - Yes, you do. - Nonsense. You believe me! Since I left I don't know how many years ago, I haven't seen my mother. Donnadieu, share your toys. - Who gave you those cowboys? - Dad did. No, no! Cowboys are mean. - They wiped out the Indians. - I said that. I'll swap them for Indians. I don't like the Indians. Donnadieu! What kind of name is that? It sounds like old French! I'm Senegalese. Mouss is Algerian. These two... Comorians. - What are you? - Leave him alone! Beat it. Are you an Arab? Donnadieu isn't Arabic. I am. He's fine as he is. The name doesn't suit your face. Mom's French. - She's a citizen of the world. - Citizen of my ass! - Dad's Algerian. - Do you eat pork? - No. - Ah, Muslim. We're vegetarian. What do you believe in? - God-in-each-of-us. - Who? - You're nothing at all. - Nothing. We're not nothing. On the contrary, we're everything. But everything is nothing. You have to be something, like the others. It's all right if you're not like them. It shows you can be different. - You're an example to them. - But... can you be friends with an example? We like every god, because they're all good. You know God doesn't exist. You know that, right? Mom, we didn't ask you. We're all alone in this life. Remember that. No-one will help you. Can I borrow some money? Now we know why you're here! Come on, we have work to do. My pension money was wrong. They made a mistake. My landlord says he'll evict me. You want money for gambling. Nonsense! Just admit it. The truth is important. That's mean. I've tried so hard to change. I swear on my pension book. I'd rather have cash. I'll mind the kids for you. We're not rich. You know that, right? Of course. You won't work. I work. But I refuse to be paid. Understand? - Omar... - Yes? Can I ask you a favour? Yes. Right away. Dad, what're you doing? I have a leak. I don't know what to do. Can you have a look? Sure. No, Dad, please! It'll take 2 minutes. Right away. Come on, kids. What about the pool! We all knew Ebony was the local whore. Only Dad never noticed. That's for you... - and that's for you. - Thanks. There we are! All fixed. No more leak. - What do I owe you? - Nothing, thanks. How can I thank you? You and I could have a coffee... Why not? Thanks. Tomorrow at 2? I'm free. Now is more simple, isn't it? Now? If you have no coffee, water is fine, too. A little glass of water... Fine, a glass of water. What a nice lady. It's strange she's not married. It's for the kids. It's on me. For the kids. I'll take Dr. Girard his delivery. Dad, I have nothing to do. Can I go? - It's too heavy for you. - Please, Dad. Alright, then. Hanna, go with your brother to the doctor. Hanna, go on! - Give me a bag, I'll go faster. - No, it's all right. - Sure? - Yeah. - Bang, bang! - Die! What're you doing? Out of the way! We're playing cowboys. - Get out of the way! - What are you doing? I've got Indians. Can I play? Fine. Can I, Hanna? Please? - You all right? - I coughed, so Dr. Girard examined me. I have a throat infection and I need medicine. Really? Here's the money for his shopping. - Wash your hands. - They're clean. Money's dirty, you know that. Smaïn, let's go. - I don't want to go to school. - Come on. And don't sigh. Hi, Grandpa. There you are. Hey, my toast! Don't disturb your father when he's praying. We'll be late for school, honey. Come on, it's nearly 8. - See I bought you some pastries? - Yeah. You need more distance from your son. - That's not possible. - Why not? Because I raise him on my own, so I can't. I don't want more distance. He has no father. So, more distance from his mother, no. - I'm going to work. - I'll come with you, Dad. Go to work. - You'll be late. - I hate working for a rival. I can't pay you, so do what you have to do. - See you tonight. - See you tonight, son. You've always been very competent. If I could have avoided this, I would have. I don't understand. I've worked here for 10 years. Yes, I know, but... we have to cut staffing levels. Your post in particular is being restructured. But I've always had the highest respect for your work - and dedication. - That's no consolation. I'm 45. I'll never find another job. I'm sorry. I have a big mortgage. I'll lose my house. I pay for my son's student room. - Oh, no... - I'll have nothing. What'll I do? I'm really sorry. How can I make it up to you? I'm really, really sorry. My daughter was learning the bugle. She's brilliant. She'll have to stop. Oh, no! - Hello. - Hello, ma'am. I want jackfruit. - Jackfruit? - Yes, jackfruit. Jackfruit. I'll be right back. Thank you. Here you are. Here's your jackfruit. No, that's not it. It's exactly something else. Jackfruit is very big. Simone, do we have any jackfruit? Jackfruit? - No. - No way! It's a catastrophe. Where can we order them? I don't know. What'll I tell her? - No. - Are you sure? - May I offer you some kumquats? - No, thank you. I just want jackfruit. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you... Shit! - Shit! - Stop it! - Stop it! - Shit! Stop it! What's wrong? Stop it. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Forgive me. - What's wrong? - I don't know. It's only natural. You're on edge, worried... about your son. I must order jackfruit right now. Then, I'll make sure that Donnadieu and Hanna will be here tonight. What're you doing here? I checked the birthday candles. There's no 5 and 8. You're out of brushes. I'll go check. And toothpicks. They're essential items. I'll tell the boss, but let me work. They're not serious. You don't work like that. Do you have to keep an eye on me? I'm here to help you. I do have some experience of commerce. Are you all right? How do you feel? - Are you strong enough? - No-one knows! Hakim. Is there a problem? - He's my father. - You're Hakim's father? How do you like the store? His name is Donnadieu. No, Dad. That was to get my papers. My real name's Hakim. No toothpicks. That's not good. You're right, I'll go check. Pleased to meet you. I told you 100 times to call me Hakim. Why do you want to bring me trouble? Just let me work. I'm going. - Eat with us tonight? - Of course. I live with you. Of course. Your mother made couscous. I was just checking. Yes, I know, but he was in distress. Make them pay you at least. Otherwise, it's a waste. Sorry, you're right. Next time, I'll ask for money for you. No, I meant for you. I'd be pleased to give it to you. I don't need the money. Hey, I'm not your pimp! You're crazy, you are! You come to Rue St Denis more. It's simpler in Paris. And there are my colleagues. Thank you for this fine partnership. Thank you, sir. All the best. Toast? Oh, yes, please. Kind regards. - Best wishes. - Goodbye. Bye. Thanks. Are you all right? People no longer want to repair things themselves. I just tried to help a guy who'd broken down. It was like I attacked him. You have more time for yourself. We didn't go to the mechanic. We held the gearbox with elastic bands. Yes! - We kept on breaking down. - It was good though. We repaired the car outside our building. You could go to the café. They all go to the mosque now. Seen those halal stores? It's not right. They don't sell pork. When you have a store in France, you have to sell ham and bacon. I don't eat pork. But I've always sold pork and bacon. Always. It doesn't bother me. Stop it. You're an Arab, but you sound like a fascist. I put myself in French people's shoes. There are a lot of us. What's wrong? I open at 3 o'clock. I better go. - Coming tonight? - Yes. - Donnadieu won't be there? - No! Don't look, don't look! He can't stop looking! - Hello, honey. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm well. Good to see you. Here she is! Why is he here? Dad, you said he wouldn't be here. Come here. Look. Look, Kenza's here. - Kenza's here. - Hello. It's been a while. - Hi. - You all right? It's good, being all together, right? Look how your nephews have grown. Aren't they cute? Don't you have something for Aunty? For you, Aunty. It's Princess Hanna. Oh, how pretty. You draw really well. We're a real family. That's great. I'm so pleased. Why is she here? You don't look well. Ramadan doesn't suit you. - Stop... - Don't talk to me. Look. Try Kenza's shakshouka. It's really... Delicious. Very good! - Who wants some tea? - I do. Can I take this to my room? Yes, go with your sister. - What do you want? - To see you. We're a family! - I haven't seen this jerk in ages. - Don't talk like that in front of my wife! Hakim, stop! It's bad for you to get angry. He tries to hit me, but he shouldn't get angry. Great! Nothing changes here! Your brother's sick. She doesn't care. Hakim has kidney trouble. In time, he'll need a transplant. The best people for that... are brothers and sisters. I didn't ask for anything. I don't need anything. A transplant? - It's serious? - Yes. We have to be quick to see if you're compatible. And... Then, they just take out one of your kidneys and transplant it in Hakim. - It's a major operation. - Look at her... I could die, she wouldn't lift a finger. - I didn't... - She doesn't care. Take your time to think about it. I don't want her kidney. Isn't my kidney good enough for you? - I know. It's impure? - It can't be good. It's not halal? It says "Screw you"! - Shut up! - It drinks, smokes, has sex... - Don't talk like that to your sister! - Put some clothes on! Donnadieu! Hey, Donnadieu! Have you forgotten your name, too? What about the transplant? Hang on, Mom. What makes you so angry? Well... There's also halal alcohol-free champagne, red and white wine. I recommend it, it's really good. The books. And a wide choice of Islamic clothes and underwear. A lot of choice, indeed. All you need for outdoors as well as indoors. All certified halal? Absolutely. We have the Islamic seal of approval. See this doll? Just like the real thing. Great for kids and converts who are learning the prayers. - How reassuring. - "Being a good Muslim - is fun." - Our motto. We're very proud of our other services. The Islamic hands-free kit with a niqab, also available in Bluetooth. Not forgetting halal apps when you're not sure what you can and can't do. Ask any question. Scratching your backside during Ramadan. Halal or not halal? Meeting a vital need is not a sin as long as they are followed by ablutions. Wow, not bad. We also have smart trips for Ramadan. The best places for fasting, so you can eat at an earlier hour. For example, if the Ramadan is in August, it's best to go... in Patagonia, because then, the day lasts 3 hours. - Well? - Patagonia. - It's pathetic. - What? Ramadan is a trial. You can't cheat. Go back to work. Is it halal to make money from halal? Have a look around. Are you insinuating I'm a bad Muslim? Only Allah knows. I hired you, 'cause you're local, but don't push it. Kenza. Kenza, where are you? Here. Still smoking? Respect your kids. I do - I hide to smoke. - Like you. - Nonsense! I'm a good Muslim mother, but 2 kids can get too much. And I worry about you. What's wrong? Did you have trouble at work? I'm sick of France. I want to go back to Algeria. You never lived there! I dream of living there. It's my country, I know it. A pure country where you help others and money doesn't matter. You say that, 'cause you don't know it. I went every summer. Vacations are different. I always felt good there. I was very close to my cousin, Zinedine. He longed to come here. We tried to get him in, but they refused with their racist laws. Algerians can't come visit their families. Is that normal? No, of course not. But you need treatment. President Bouteflika's treated here. I'm sure Zinedine will find us a place to live. I'll call him. Dad... - What's this? - What? - What's this? - My jellabas. I'll dress like a real Muslim. I'm sick of looking French. What're you doing here? - Do you want coffee? - No, thanks. Funny that you... Well, your brother's in the hospital, having dialysis. It's worse now. So, we came to get you... so you could go take some compatibility tests. My parents. This is... - Christophe. - Right. - Hello there. - Hello. - Good to meet you. - Thank you. Could you leave us alone, please? I see. Can I get a coffee? Yes. Help yourself. It's there. Get dressed, we're going now. I want to think it over. You can think later. You should buy an espresso machine. I can go get him one now. - No, Dad! - All right. No, I'll be fine. It's just... Why wait? We know you'll say yes. I might say no. I'm allowed to. We never said you couldn't say no, but you won't. How do you know? I don't know yet. We just know. What do you want? The jam. - No jam? - No. I could go... No, Dad, you won't go get jam! - Go to the hospital. - You're coming? I don't know. I want to think it over first. - Go on, think it over. - Didn't you have to go? Oh? Fine, I'll be going, then. It was great. Thanks a lot. Well, apart from breakfast. - Are you thinking? - Yes. Well? - Alright, then. - See? See how well we know you? Come on, honey. Your blood pressure's fine. I'll let you rest. See you later. Hello. - All right? - Leave me alone. Donnadieu... I'm giving you my kidney. I've just done the tests. If the results are positive, I can give it to you. Did you hear me? What's that jellaba? I left a red sock in the machine. Why look like an Arab? Have you forgotten where you come from? You've forgotten where you come from. You're French. - I'm not. - You are. You're French. Our mother's French. You have a French passport. A pink jellaba and a beard don't change that. I do as I please. If I want to be Algerian, I'm Algerian. I'm resisting so my roots survive in a hostile land. - You're French. - I'm not. - You're French. - I'm not. - You're French. - I'm not French! Are you all right? All right? Hey! - Hey there! - What's happening? - I don't know. He... - Excuse me. Go out, miss. We'll handle this. Mr. Belkacem... Breathe deeply. Again. Cough. Again. One more time. I'll go pay the doctor tomorrow. He said there was no need, he could treat us for free. What a good man Dr. Girard is. People are so money-minded. Caught you! Go to prison. Hey! What are you doing? Every week, for 2 years, I delivered the shopping to Dr. Girard. Hello, Hanna. No, stay there. I don't need you to come anymore. Why? I'll manage. As I like you a lot, I got you a gift. To thank you. My breasts saved me. I've always been grateful to them. Stop it! Don't lick me. Go away. You're a quality dog. How are you doing? Help yourselves, it's free! It's free. Shut up, you! Look at your sister. Look what a slut she is. She's a slut! We've all screwed your slut sister! - She's not a slut. - Say she's a slut! The whore! - Jerk! - Dumb fuck! Slut brother! I never slept with those guys. - They say you did. - In their dreams! I'd rather sleep with "fags". - What? - What they call the French. - Wear other clothes. - What? Everyone's talking about you. - Playing big brother? - Get changed. - I do as I like. - Cover up. Stop it. Hey, Donnadieu, come here. The fucker! Stay downstairs in case he comes out. Where is he? If we find him, we'll kill the bastard! Where the hell is he? Bastard! Yo. Yeah, that's better. Yo, bro. Yeah, that's better. Yo, man. How's it hangin'? Yo, Mouss. How you doin'? Chillin'? Where's Sawid? Mike Tyson, man. - Are you going out? - Yeah! - Can you talk to me nicely? - I'm going out. That's not it. Can you talk nicely? When'll you be home? I'll be back later for dinner. - Alright, then. - Bye. - Yo. - Yo, man. Chillin'? - All good? - You? That looks like a tablecloth. Don't diss my hoodie. Doesn't it look like a tablecloth? Goin' for a picnic? - What do you want? - 20's worth. Yours are much bigger. - The others take a cut. - You don't? No, it's not right. - Have you eaten? - No. - Aperi-spliff. - Thanks, man. - See you. - Bye. Later. No! - I said no. - C'mon, 2 or 3 joints. You're my grandma! It's therapeutic, for my cancer. - I need treatment. - You have cancer? Yes, it's my secret. - You're a pain. - I'll pay you once I scam your Mom. Let me work. Got a light? You go too far. Here. Want a lung, too? Puss, puss. You're a fine cat. You're a quality cat. Yes, you are. Come here. What're you doin'? Don't touch my sister! - Stay away from her. - Leave him! - Touch her... - Stop it! - And I'll kill you! - I decide who touches me! I'm protecting you. I don't want your protection! I love you. I love you. - Thanks. - Thank you. - See you soon. - See you. Donnadieu, are you crazy? Dr. Girard is too well-known. He won't talk. We take his cash and go. He won't file a complaint. - When? - We stick him up. When? I'm up for it. On Friday. What day's today? Tuesday. There's 2 days left. - Hey, doc. - What do you want? Hey there. Give us your money. Now! And don't grass! Grab him. Throw him on the ground! Guys, I got the cash. - Fucker! - Let's go. - Bastard! - Let's go. - Donnadieu, we're good, bro. - Sonovabitch! - He's lost it. - Let's go. Hanna Belkacem? Dr. Martin? It's strange, meeting here. No, it's logical. We first met in this hospital. Right. So, you're compatible with your brother? That's what I was told. Get undressed. I mean, for the scan. Can you please lift up your... the blouse... - Like that? - Yes. Both kidneys must be perfect for the transplant. The kidney for your brother but also the other one... as it'll do all the work. Ah, I see the membrane. It looks very good. You live fine with one. Please, stop talking. It's good she's compatible and she agrees. I don't want her kidney. I was clear, wasn't I? Look, your relationship with her doesn't concern me. Families are always complicated. Your sister is a wonderful person. She loves you a lot. She's very worried about your health. - Nonsense! - She told me so. She didn't hesitate. It's a loving gesture... that you can't refuse. You have a loving family, children... It's vital that I operate on you. A kidney's just an organ. There's no soul in it. No religion prevents kidney transplants. Think it over. Hanna! Coffee, darling? - She's so cute! - Always in a miniskirt. Fresh as a daisy. Hey, sweetie. Go on, help yourself. Any news of your son? I met the principal after his call. - She's rambling again. - The vipers! A nice guy. Understanding. He saw that the father was strange, a bit unusual... But he didn't criticize. He just said Raoul was a bit hyperactive. It's hard to talk about. It stresses me out. - I get so emotional. - Come on. - A customer. - Go on, you need the work. - Need some help? - Yes, I... - I want to talk to her. - Which one? The brunette with the leather skirt. Hanna, yes. A customer who knows you, darling. - Me? - Go on. He looks nice. A guy with a good situation. Go on. Yeah, we'll have a laugh! - Run. - Go talk to him. You never know. All right, here I go. Dare you! - Hanna, be careful, though. - Yes. Hello. Hello. Here for a whore? No, no, you're wrong. I just was going past - and saw you. - They all say that. Think whoring's shameful? No, not at all. I respect whores a lot. Want to come up? It'll be fine. Don't worry. - Do you have a cigarette? - Sure. I didn't have time to buy any. Thanks. I don't have a light. I do. Thanks. What do you want? To say thank you... for the transplant. I thought it over. I agree to the operation, too. I'm pleased. Yes, it's good. Yes. Want to come in? Hello. Good to see you. You look better. The dialysis is helping? The news is very good about the transplant. Hanna's kidneys are perfectly healthy. I just saw the results. It's really very reassuring. Thank you, thank you. - What's wrong? - Let's go. Hakim, what happened? I'm sorry. I know him, he won't want to, now. Sorry, I'm not used to this. I'm afraid it's not enough. That's fine for this time. Thanks. It seemed... very real. Yeah, I'm a professional! And you kiss? I heard - you don't kiss... - Oh, yes. I love kissing. It's what I like best. - You like it? - Sure. - Can I see you again? - Call in whenever you want. I'm here. Thanks. Thank you. Come back when you like. I'll do a cut rate. Stop it, Hakim! Calm down, it'll be all right! - You've gone crazy. - No-one can stop me. You damn fool! Do you know Algeria? I do! I know why I left. There's no work. No room for different people. The Algerians wanna come here. You wanna go there! What's wrong with you? You wanted France? - I want Algeria. - The operation first. Stop it. I'd rather die over there. My darling. Look what I got you. I got your favorite candy. Orangina candy, cake candy, potato chips... There you are. Don't touch it, you! If you won't stay for yourself, stay for your daughter. I'm leaving for them, too. She's intelligent, lively... What'll she do there? She'll be much happier here. - Alright? - Yes. - I'll miss you. - See you soon. - Call us. - When we arrive. - Be careful. Call me. - I will. Let them go. Come on. Here. Here we are. - The bedroom. - Right. This is the corridor, obviously. - That's where you'll sleep. - Yeah. Kitchen, bedroom. Bedroom, kitchen... as you wish. Do it up as you wish. All right? You can paint that red - or black, depending on your taste. - Right. I'll put some plaster up there. Don't bother. When people come, they won't notice. You can watch the sun set. The lighthouse there. It's really beautiful. - Thanks. - No problem. Thanks a lot. - Do you like it? - Great. - Thank you. - No, thank you. No, thank you. Go see your sister. You and your wife... And your... Did you vacation in Afghanistan? What's with the clothes? Aren't we dressed like Muslims? I'm Muslim too, and I'm dressed normally. Forget it, Hakim. Let's continue the visit. Let's see the terrace. OK. It's dangerous for the kids. - I'll change the window. - Will you change the ceiling, too? I'll show you the heating. It's dangerous, too. - It's just not practical. - Is the paint not practical? I'll repaint, I'll renovate. Kenza, calm down! You can't renovate, Hakim. You spent all our savings. We have nothing. This is our life now. You just have to trust me. Darling, I'm a citizen, I vote, OK? I'm not for Europe, but I vote. But we have no status. You're human, so you vote. My job isn't on my tax form, so I won't vote. - That's right. - Is that so? I disagree. - What do you put? - Bitch. - Hi. - This is Paul. - Hi, Paul. - Hi. - Hello, Doctor. - Do you vote? Sometimes. Are you busy? No, we're having a break. - Coffee? - Yes, please. He exists. Society recognizes him. - You exist, too. - No way. - You've a problem. - Are you local? Next door. I'm from the suburbs, but work here. Very far away. - It is, darling. - Typical Parisian reaction! Yeah, he keeps teasing you. How much? - It's my break. - I'll pay more. Politics fosters respect. - Seriously. C'mon. - Leave her alone. Shut up, this is business. Show some respect. She's a whore. I do as I please. Say sorry right now. - Move or I'll headbutt you. - Forget it. Go on, then. You asked for it. - Hey! - Beat it! - What? - You big fuckin' jerk! - All right? - Yes, it's... just an epistaxis. - I'm used to it. - An epi what? It's a nosebleed. That's all. Are you all right? It doesn't hurt too much? No, really. You need to cover up. Does it bother you that I look like a whore? Not at all. I'm scared you'll catch cold. You don't catch cold if you cover the neck, feet, and hands. So, does that mean I can go out naked with a scarf, socks, and gloves? And you'll never catch cold. You take care of yourself, Hanna. I don't deserve your love. You know... I need to tell you about my job. Tell me later. I have a surprise for you. Sorry, we were on edge over that Sandrine business. I understand. I apologize. Not at all. You're called Hanna Belkacem? That's right. That's my real name. My father's Algerian, my mother's French. Cool. How did you meet? In high school, on the trip to London. No, honey, she's not Sandrine. Are you stupid? Doesn't matter. We met at the hospital. Doctor, too? No. More of a patient. Unethical, hitting on your patients! You're not a doctor, then? Original! I'm a cardiologist. I'm a dentist. Dentist isn't doctor. It's great, but you're not a doctor. I'm a school shrink. Bravo! And you? Well... I'm Director of Human Resources... actually... at the House of Wine. - We specialize in vintage wine. - Great! You must get free wine. Hanna... Tell them the truth. They can take it. It's the truth. - Human resources? - Yes. Hanna is a whore. She's very good at it. Very professional. She loves her job. I'm fine with it. I hope you'll accept her, because I love her... as she is. Well, well... And... You didn't want to run your parents' pizzeria? But... when you say whore, you mean escort? No, whore. Streetwalker? - Streetwalker. - How original! It's interesting. Which street do you work? It's important to know where you work. The corner of - Rue St. Denis... - Rue St. Denis! Great! It's famous. It's like going to the department store. You know bolts are in the basement. And you know that is what's there. Oh, yeah? You don't fall into it? - Meaning? - I don't know. I heard that most prostitutes were raped as children. Yes, that's right. - You should know as a shrink. - It's a cliché. I'm no authority. I saw it on some trashy TV show. It's about identifying with your attacker. I see. When you have a trauma when you're young, you decide to keep it inside, but that's the wrong thing to do, because it comes back as depression or you act on it. What's the connection between a kid getting raped and a prostitute? There's not always a connection, but there can be one. All these studies and stuff... It's not inevitable. You can get over it. You can pick yourself up... I think the same thing happened to my brother as a kid. That's why he started doing stupid stuff as a teenager. I think that's why he beat up Dr. Girard. It's not... It's not by chance, it can't be. And I... I did nothing to stop it. I could have. But I didn't. I always felt bad because of that. Now if he dies in Algeria, it'll be my fault again. I won't get over it if he dies. Can I have a tissue? I had 3 temporary contracts. I feel much better. Good. Self-confidence is very important. - Is your bag packed? - Yes. I wouldn't mind a coffee myself. - Here. - Thanks. Sorry, I'm early. I didn't know you were working. It's easier to get fired by someone like you. It sweetens the pill. Thank you. What did he say? Well, I had to let him go. She fired me. After 3 temporary contracts, I'm out on my ass. Can you explain? I tried to tell you several times. I'm in human resources, not whoring. I'm sorry. I knew it, you're disappointed. You slept with him for fun? No, not for fun. It's... Sorry. It was very good... He was so upset. - It was to console him? - Right. Like with me. It's what you do. No, with you, it was very different. You're mad at me? It's true that a whore sleeps with everyone, but if you're not a whore, I can understand him. I wouldn't like it. Could you leave us, please? Of course. All the best, you two. Thanks for everything. Why do you force yourself to do that? I don't force myself. It comes naturally. You're hurt. - I can stop if you like. - Maybe. No? Yes. I could give them... a case of wine instead. Wine is good. What're you doing here? When did you get here? Just now. Hello. - How are you? - Fine, thank God. This is my sister and her partner, Paul. - From France. - Hello. Alright? This is my sister, Hanna. Come on. I'll put him to bed. - He doesn't look well. - He's not. He hasn't peed for 3 days. He doesn't look after himself. Can't we get him to accept the operation? He won't. While a patient's conscious, we can't force treatment on him. What if he wasn't? Go over there. It's on medical grounds. There. No... There! Fine, fine. - I'll lose my job. - No, just smile. - Hello. - Hello, sir. - I'm his doctor... - Why was he in Algeria? On vacation. - Like that? - Yes. He's Algerian? No, he has a French passport. - Father's name? - Mohamed. His father's Algerian, so is he. His mother's French, Simone Dupuy. Who cares? He's Algerian. I don't understand Arabic. - You're Algerian, too. - Are you stupid? We were born and grew up in France. I'm French, he's French. Do you want him to die here as an Algerian? She's a bit upset, but everything's alright. - Which hospital? - Christchurch. Christchurch? Christchurch. I know it well. - My aunt's there. - No? What a coincidence. What's her name? Mounia Zoubir, know her? That rings a bell. - Is she in... - In? - In... - In cardiology. Right. - She has a peacemaker. - A pacemaker. You should watch her. - Bon voyage. - Thank you. She said he was nice, not handsome. - She said it. - He's handsome. Oh, my girl! How are you? What's going on? The operation went well. Everything's fine. He was operated on, this morning. His condition worsened. They found a donor. - We were so lucky. - No operation for you. You must be relieved, you hate hospitals. Nothing to say to your sister? Thank you, Hanna. It's thanks to you. - Alright, honey? - Not too hot? A bit. Did you decide to do that? It was strictly a medical decision. We saved your brother, right? I was supposed to save him with my kidney. It was important to me. I told you. - How selfish. Where's your kindness? - Let go. You want to please everyone, because you can't say what you want. What do you want with me? In your life, what do you want? For once, I was doing something for myself. I can't do a thing. I mess up all the time. Stop torturing yourself. Did he go through what you did? Before you try to save him, save yourself. - What? - What did you do for that girl? - Why didn't you save her? - Stop... Why didn't you refuse to go to Dr. Girard? If you'd made some excuse, you'd have avoided 2 years of hell. Why didn't you look out for yourself? Why didn't you say anything? I don't know. I never thought of it. Been drinking? No. Yes, a bit. But it's for work. Everyday I think of what happened to you. Everyday I wonder why I didn't see a thing. You couldn't suspect a man who provided free treatment. I'm sorry. My little girl... It's cold, you have to get out. I'm not cold. At least it gets you out of your shit hole! It's something, the Grand Prix. Simone? Yes, it's magnificent. It is. It's exotic. It's real pretty. Hanna, go have a bet for me. Here, put it all on King of Persia. Shit! Look out! Sorry, did I hurt you? - Of course you did! - Sorry. I can't feel a thing, so I guess it's all right. You gave me a fright. Stay here. - Ouch, my back! - Sorry. - My back. - Sorry. - Don't leave me. - Sorry, I'm going. - Hey! - Sorry. - Hi. - I don't have time. My sister had a car crash. Terrible. - Want a coffee? - No. I'm so depressed. It'd do me the world of good. I know, but... you bug me. I don't care. I'm sorry. See, I covered up. I don't want to catch cold for nothing. Now I know what I want. I want you. I want all of you. When I'm pregnant, we'll see the real Sandrine Delivet. You'll tell her we met thanks to her. I'll be jealous. I won't think we look alike. You'll say it's because she cut her hair. We'll think the same thing at the same time, but we won't get bored. When I'm sick, you'll look after me. No, I'll get sick before you. Doctors don't get sick. We won't. We'll have a car crash on your 90th birthday. Because your sight will be poor, but you'll still want to drive. I'm all yours I'm made to serve you I give my body to the future I'm all yours I'm made, my heart makes Trouble like Marilyn, but worse The pleasure will be all ours Service first and foremost Can we bite your cheeks? The pleasure will be all yours Service first and foremost You can bite my neck I'm all yours I'm turned upside down I take quite a few blows I'm all yours I'm on a train without tracks I put on kid gloves, grin and bear it -- English --
