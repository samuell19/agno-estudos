THE BIG SWAG How are you? Did you see the match yesterday? 'For ten years ticket puncher F?lix Pignol at subway station 'La Rap?e'... saw the money train arrive at 0:49. It was motorised carriage 517 with the daily takings... of the 300 subway stations, on the way to the treasury of the RATP... with on board 600 million worth of change.' Excellent. 'The carriage was jokingly called 'the big swag'... and had been transformed into a mobile vault. Three money collectors divided... the notes and the coins over the various steel drawers. An easy job. La Rap?e was the last station before the treasury of the RATP... that was located in a basement, 900 metres further along. Ang?lique, a drink? My treat. -I can't tonight. Then you won't know how it ended. The ending will be extremely tense. Hadley Chase will get a big fright. Tell me tomorrow, Mr Bourdin. Bye, beautiful. She thinks she's a stewardess. She'll be gone again soon. She does it to keep me dangling. But I don't buy that. I'm buying us a drink, boss. And I'll read from my detective novel. My wife's waiting for me. -I can go with you. Another time. We have company. -But they'll like it. No, not tonight. -Alright, since you tell me so nicely... 'A good... catch.' Exclamation mark. THE END. 'The five bags were floating towards St. Louis Island... Angling could start. 600 million worth of change. A good catch. The End.' Money train, disloyal employee, Miss Subway, Arsenal Station, fishing... Six months of work, 325 pages. They can brace themselves. Novel. Detective novel. By Louis... Bourdin. An American name would be better. Fleming, Hadley Chase... Chandler. The best have been taken. Novel. Detective novel by Louis... le Normand. I haven't read that one. Great book. That book's worthless. The nun did it. -Idiot. No unsuitable distractions during work hours. If you continue to act the clown, I'll report you. Loser. He's giving orders, but he can't even write. Excuse me, Paris traffic is a disaster. Take the subway. No need for Miss Subway 1959 to always be late. Ang?lique. Your ticket office was very busy. Doesn't your wrist hurt, boss? I'll have you transferred, you know. -Thanks. That sounds good. I've got something for you. -You shouldn't have. It's not chocolate. It's my detective novel. It's finished. Od?on. -Change at Austerlitz. I'll buy you a sauerkraut and I'll read it to you. What's it called? -'Robbery at the RATP'. I've got something for you. Catch. You shouldn't have, F?lix. -It's nothing. Do you like it? Lilacs. Great. Pignol, is your wife alright? -What is it to you? And are the kids growing well? How many do you have? Six or seven? If people ask you... -Exactly. I need to know. Bastard. -What's with you? It's not my fault you have a big family. Quick, there he is. What about the sauerkraut, Ang?lique? I had plans with my cousin. -Yes, she forgot. Give me your book. Will you read it tonight? -If I'm not too tired. Don't lose it. I don't have another one. What do I care? I don't like sauerkraut. See you on Saturday. -At ten. Tell me, who really wrote it? -Me, of course. All alone? -Do you want me to smack you? I'd never have thought. I read all night. It's great. Really? Did you really like it? I told you I didn't get any sleep. Keep going. Have you gone crazy, Bourdin? What did you think of the Arsenal? -Great. You didn't expect that of me, did you? -Great. I'm stupefied. Well? -Here's your hole. And that miraculous catch? Good idea, wasn't it? I have a lot of imagination. Don't underestimate me. I look around without making people notice. I'm surprised it hasn't been done yet. -Nice of you to say that. That proves that it's a realistic story. Pignol's face when he reads this... -Oh, his face. Will it be published soon? Stay on the line, Madam. Mr Gaston, I have Mr Mauriac for you on line three. I'd like to speak to Mr Ganimard. Do you have an appointment? Tell him I'm a ticket puncher and I wrote a detective novel. It features a great hold-up. -I'm afraid Mr Ganimard's travelling. Mr Simenon? Stay on the line. I'll connect you right away. And the gentleman of the S?rie Sombre... Marcel... You have no luck. Mr Dukamel's in the US. Alright, then I'll read you a bit. So you know what we're talking about. 'Pignol, ticket puncher at La Rap?e... saw the carriage arrive, like every other night. The mobile vault was transporting the daily takings worth 600 million. The disloyal employee smiled slyly.' Tell me honestly. Are you getting curious about the rest? Yes, leave it here and you'll hear from us. Unbelievable. Is Louis le Normand a pseudonym? -My nom de plume. Do you like it? We only sell American names in the S?rie Sombre. I thought as much. -Brigitte. I've got a manuscript here. They'll have a laugh upstairs. The author is a ticket puncher in the subway. So? A ticket puncher can have as much talent as a bourgeois. Hello, fellow autodidact. There's the author. I heard you're about to win the Nobel prize. I'd like to read it. -You'd first have to learn to read. You're only a ticket puncher. Some ticket punchers want to get up in life. You've really grown. What's happening to you? I'm an autodidact. -Auto what? Poor fellow. You don't even speak French. Cut it out with those fancy words. -You're very superficial. An autodidact has taught himself. I thought your parents did. Leave me alone. There's no hope for you. Who does he think he is? You don't fit through the turnstile anymore. Give him another cap, because his head... So you wrote a masterpiece? You look taller than normal. -I've always looked taller than I am. But you can still call me by my first name, boss. We're all talking about you. A loser like you who writes detective novels... We're all laughing. What did the publisher say? -They were very enthusiastic. I knew you'd become famous. Will it be published soon? -You and I will be in a Cadillac soon. Shall we have a drink later? A quick one. I have an appointment with my publisher. To sign. Would you sign here? But isn't your name Bourdin? Indeed. 'Unfortunately, we have to send back your manuscript. Your subject is not very good. The hold-up is unrealistic. Therefore, we cannot publish your work. Yours truly...' Unrealistic. Is 600 million unrealistic? Come have a look. And doesn't the Seine flow towards St. Louis Island? Yes, it does. We live in unrealistic times. Say, that book of yours... I can't believe it. It's unrealistic, isn't it? -What would you know? Are you alright? -I'm fine. I changed publishers. -Why? The S?rie Sombre has been sold to the Americans. I'm now with Presses de la Cit?, with Simenon. I changed the title. -Why? Only American titles sell. 'M?tropolitain Story'. -Great. The title's important. It grabs you or it doesn't. Les Presses de la Cit?. Sign here. I just got a delivery from Hachette Publishers. Isn't your book here yet? This is going too far. Maybe it's the strikes. I have to go. They're waiting for me. They're often forgotten in a drawer. That book of his will be published when hell freezes over. Want to bet? Mr author. Will your best seller be published or what? Boss, Bourdin had us going with his book. Will it be published or not? Ang?lique keeps talking about it. Tell your publisher you have 35,000 colleagues, plus their families. Shall we have a drink later? If the publishers don't want it, just tell me. Why wouldn't they want it? Wasn't it great? It will be published. Plon Publishers. Sign here. Is it about finished? It's very high up here. Do you ever take the subway? -Certainly. Listen, this is really true. Each night, at 0:45 AM, at La Rap?e... -I have to finish my round. Three minutes. That's all I'm asking. 'The loot floated not far from the fishing line. Sullivan saw the nylon bag, in the pale moonlight.' Dot, dot dot... 'The five bags were floating towards St. Louis Island. This would be a miracle: 600 million worth of change. A good catch.' Period. The end. Well, is that unrealistic? It comes across real. Like a newspaper article. They'd be very happy with this hold-up. Publishers? -No, crooks. Everything. In order. Except the beans. Grated carrots, celeriac, p?t? de campagne, green olives... Has he been in jail for long? For five years. -Amazing. Did he ever carry out a hold-up? -He did just about everything. I'll have a bite to eat there. Enjoy your meal. The mutton stew. You have a big stain there. That won't come out later. No, your own. Three coffees and three cognacs. I want another napkin. -You already have one. I want another one. Warm, isn't it? A coffee, please. Sugar, please. How are you? See you on Thursday. -No, the boss will be released tomorrow. He won't be prosecuted. -As always. We'll celebrate. Filippi comes out tomorrow. Open a Veuve Clicquot. To the boss. -He's the best. Indeed. Compared to Filippi, we're amateurs. Not bad, that champagne. -From '43. Bastard. To steal from a man who just served five years. I got the wrong pocket. -The bloody nerve. A scandal. Call the police, Pauline. -Never mind. We'll settle it ourselves. Step aside, guys. -Easy. Easy, I said. Open the door. -Don't. You don't scare me. FILIPPI: NOT PROSECUTED AGAIN Look. Strange escort. I must be over the hill. Strange man, strange vehicle. The police are always one step behind. Clarence, brake hard. Do you think that, in spite of the traffic lights and the traffic... a Cadillac can shake a bike? Doubtful, but I'll try. Well done, Clarence. Hello. Thank you for your good work. No, thank you. An excellent alibi. Wasn't the holiday a bit long? Is there another place beyond jail, where one can still read Proust? Good. I'll speak to you in five minutes. Hello, sir. You look very good. The holiday must have done you good. I had a good rest. A Dom P?rignon '47 for Mr Loriot. Is your paid holiday over? -Time to go to work. I have a plan. A sure thing. -That doesn't exist. What's it about? -The Bank of Africa. Another bank. It's becoming boring. Let me see if I can still do it. -There's that man again. What do you want? -I can bowl here, can't I? You stole from the customers. -You're crazy. I didn't do anything. What's this then? -That's mine. Thieves. Come here and say that. You're having fun, aren't you? -I'm laughing. Why? -I can't say, but we'll be laughing. Do the night shifts with me, Ang?lique. You won't regret it. I told you we'll have a laugh. I don't know about that. You've been transferred. You're kidding. -It's official. That's impossible. I want to stay here, now that... Now that what? -Nothing. Keep me here. I like you. Maybe, but you like her more. I admit that, but do you know what's on page 1 of my book? 'To my boss. By his loyal ticket puncher.' Is that really true? Alright then. I'll fix it. -Thank you. Hey, Pignol. You're lucky to have a friend like me. Shut up and give me that. Don't talk to me like that. As of tomorrow I'll do your night shifts. Why would you? I think a father of a big family should be home after dinner. Boss, as of tomorrow, I'm taking over Pignol's night shift. As you wish. Bourdin, you're great. -We have to help each other. If I had seven children... -Six. Six then. You'd do the same. If not, you'd be a bastard. Well, lazy bunch. Gone for some air? Yes, but why are we doing this at this hour? You never know. -Who holds up a train at this hour? Once is enough. -It doesn't make sense. It does happen, you know. Read the papers. How are you? Let's go. How is that possible? Who's that? What do you want? What are you doing there? Just a moment. Your book is fascinating. I almost finished it. Don't pay any attention to me. What kind of behaviour is this? Who gave you permission to enter my place? Where did you get my address? -You forgot to put it on the envelope. Which envelope? What do you mean? I don't get it. Didn't you send this letter with the subway plan? No, I didn't. I don't even know you. What a coincidence. It's the same handwriting as yours... and it's about a hold-up of the subway... involving 600 million. Mr Filippi, I'm sorry I disturbed you... but please leave now. Or I'll lose my job. Don't panic. No one will see us. Get up. Sit down, dear Le Normand. Your detective story is very good. Authors often don't know what they're writing about, but you do. Give us a drink. If there was an underworld award, you'd get it. But you'll get one from the Quai des Orf?vres. I drink to the success of your novel. We'll make it a best seller. That mobile vault was very amusing. 600 million in notes, very fascinating. What gave you the idea to write this novel? I thought of it myself. I kept seeing the money train. It stops at La Rap?e each night. If you took the subway more often, you'd get around more. Dear Le Normand, you should see the propositions people make me every day. Incredible. Boring, banal stuff. But your story's original, completely different and even poetic. So you'd publish my book if you were a publisher? You bet. Thank God those idiots didn't publish it. Besides, except for the publishers nobody read it, right? Are you sure? -Very sure. Drink. Luc, fill him up. Your description of disloyal employee Pignol is very realistic. Your style reminds me of the best Anglo-Saxon specialists of the genre. Hemingway... Did he influence you? Nobody helped me. It's all mine. I write alone. I don't doubt it. One more question. Why did you pick me? I'm not the only one, am I? You're well-known. I've read everything about you in 'France-Soir'. You have guts. -Thank you. I have a keen eye for it. I'm the only one in Europe who can do what you wrote with style. You understand we checked some things. No problem. I made nothing up. I calculated it all. Admirable. You're the Douanier Rousseau of the detective novel... and I'll be your Apollinaire. I'll make you famous. You men could learn something from this. Let's see. Do you know how much a 100 franc note weighs? 8 milligrams. You thought of everything. The weight of the bags, the speed... an overview of the switches. So meticulous. Such professional insight. Only one important matter remains. What percentage do you want? -I don't want anything. In the theatre world it's 12%. Is that acceptable? It's government money. I won't touch it. Artists don't like to talk about money. Let me be your impresario. You won't regret it. Don't get me wrong but I have to get up at 5 tomorrow morning. It's already 1 o'clock. I'm sorry. We won't bother you any longer. Are you taking my notes? -I have to prepare, don't I? I have no copy. -I'll look after them. '600 million in change. A good catch.' I know my lines. Excuse me, your lines. We don't know each other. We've never met. You'll only hear from us again in the papers. Good night. A question. Pignol, the disloyal employee, where can we find him? What do you want with Pignol? -What are you thinking? Page... 58. I quote: 'When the money collectors saw Pignol, they opened the door without worrying. The gangsters quickly went inside with their machine guns...' If Pignol doesn't cooperate, we can't do it. Pignol's a colleague. I used his name. He doesn't know anything about it. That's a big nuisance. I have 35,000 colleagues. You must be able to find someone. I already did. Who? -You. Me? It's always best to do things yourself. The money collectors know you as well as Pignol. Yes... No... Forget the whole story. It's over. We won't talk about it again. I'm out. Forget about 600 million of used notes? I'm afraid we can't. It's easy for you. You get a pension as a civil servant. Don't be selfish. We never make it to retirement. The money collectors are armed. Before you know it, they shoot. My novel seems realistic, but reality's very different. Read this. They all agree. A very unrealistic hold-up. Do you know the story of the sorcerer's apprentice? That's for another time. One bit of advice. Do not betray Le Normand. He's a friend. Sleep well. You don't look very cheerful. Is anything wrong? Why would there be? I'm fine. Arsenal, please. 'The locks of the 300 subway stations were all the same. Pignol took the key from the station master's cabin without a problem...' Tonight rehearsal at Arsenal. See you later. Have a nice day. I really can't do it. Is it written or is it not? Did you read about the hold-up of an English mail train? Leave me alone. We can't talk during work hours. Isn't that right? She keeps talking to me. Come here. I've got good news. Look. You're staying with us. Isn't that nice? Yes and no. Maybe there are colleagues who want to work upstairs. I hope you're joking. -No, this isn't a joke. Some of them have been underground for years. I want to be transferred. I'm listening. I'm listening. Don't yell. Porte de Versailles, yes. An extra shift. I'm writing it down. Traffic... Between where? Montparnasse and Porte de Versailles. What else? Yes, I'm writing. Yes, after the 421. Bye. Still here? Go to your spot now. I'll be right back. Ang?lique! Ang?lique! You here? It's time. -Yes, didn't you see the boss? Are you alright? -Yes, I am. Let's go. Go ahead, Le Normand. Let's stick to the text. Chapter 4, page 49. Pignol opens the gate. I've been transferred to Filles du Calvaire. I missed that. Where does it say that? It's not in the book. -Then we won't talk about it. Your friend Bourdin is starting to become a pain. If he doesn't behave, I might have to use violence. Dear author, this is a very important moment in our collaboration. The show starts, but the curtain hasn't opened yet. Open that gate. It's useless, because I've been transferred. We warned Bourdin, didn't we? Is he quitting? Good to hear. After you. Careful, a train. If you agree, I'd like to enact chapter 9: Arsenal Station. Could you please tell us how Pignol goes about it? It's in the book. You only need to read it. The money train arrives and brakes for the signal. Action. Stop, stop, stop. They see it's me and I open the door. We don't need to rehearse that for hours. 57 seconds. Too long. A train. Hide. You're a great author, but a worthless actor. We need some more rehearsals for you to play the part of Pignol. Do you mind if we make some small adjustments... to the operation? I don't care. I won't be here. -Excuse me? Nothing. What if we didn't tie your colleagues to the handrail... but put them in the trunk? The next train will free them and we gain 10, 15 seconds. I don't want to know. I'll have been transferred. Transferred or not. That doesn't change anything. Oh yes. The subway's one big family. The driver will ask me what I'm suddenly doing here. He'll be suspicious and won't open. True, if Bourdin keeps refusing to let Pignol cooperate... we'll end up in a bad western with lots of shooting and dead people. That's senseless. Not to mention the widows and orphans. Terrible. You won't shoot them, will you? -What else can I do if you're not here? Careful, the money train. Hide. How are you? Did you see the match yesterday? Where's the boss? I'm asking a question. -In his office. He's crazy. When you have a nervous breakdown, you're not rational. The boss. Where is he? Are you alright? I need to talk to you. I didn't sleep all night. Where's the letter that says I'll stay at La Rap?e? Relax. You're being transferred. That's not good. Keep me here, I beg you. Or a disaster will happen. What disaster? -I can't say. Unfortunately... Since you've been writing novels, you've been crazy. And now return the key. -Which key? The key to the gate. -I don't have it. Pignol saw it. -Pignol's crazy. Give me the key, stupid idiot. Are you insane? Let go of me. We'll deal with this later. To your spot. Give me that. I want to see the personnel manager. Mr Delvique? La Rap?e here. Bourdin refuses to return the station master's key. What do I do? Good. Thank you. Tomorrow morning at 9, you'll see the shrink. No, I won't go. I'm not going. Good to see you. Don't move. I'm coming. Just what I needed. Hello, buddy. I've been looking at subway stations for you for a week. What a great plan. -What do you mean? I don't know you. Can I see your ticket? I understand. I'll wait outside. Unbelievable. I can't continue, Ang?lique. I'm ending it. I'm jumping. I'm jumping. -Don't. Turn the power off. I'm jumping. I'm jumping. -You're crazy. Don't. You have a nervous breakdown. That can happen. Let me die, boss. Ang?lique. What's wrong with the girl? Where's your colleague? -Which one? The one who was here just now. -He left an hour ago. But I didn't see him leave. -Of course not. He took the subway. Damnit. One, two. One, two. Stop. 47 minutes. Exactly correct. -I told you I checked everything. So we didn't have to do this. And this is not a good boat. Let's go back. The water police is just there. You left that detail out. Oh dear, water police. Bad luck. -It's very annoying. Is all lost now? -Not at all. It cheers me up. I see it as a challenge. Don't look so sour. We'll get those millions. Let's go. Have you got the manual? -What do you want with it? I want to see more of the area. -You already failed twice. That had nothing to do with the driving. You're an author, not a driver. -I'll never write again. What's that? You want to leave us? Don't you like it here? It's very hard. 200 km per day, 6000 per month, 72,000 per year. And Ang?lique? You won't see her anymore. Are you going to return that key? -I don't have it. Don't get worked up. It's not good for you. I was just asking. It doesn't matter. I don't have it. I don't have it. -Alright, we won't mention it again. I don't have it. We need two extra floaters or else we can't take any 100 franc coins. Not? You're crazy. We'd lose at least 50 million. It's a shame that we can't enact your text exactly. We only have 4.5 minutes to transfer the money. But that's enough. Enough time. -I know. I'd rather follow your text to the letter... SUBWAY DRIVER MANUAL but don't forget that in your novel there were four of them. Pignol was also helping. That's true. Pignol was also helping. If you'd agree to cooperate... with this little operation... -No, I won't taint my uniform. I'll add two floaters. -Good. Bourdin has the last word. Mediocrity wins once again. The student has to pay attention when operating the Westinghouse brake. DISMISSAL AND PUNISHMENT OF DISLOYAL EMPLOYEE BOURDIN For the hold-up of the money train, worsening an already big deficit... supervisor Louis Andr? Marie Bourdin, number 10229... will be demoted and executed in the presence of his colleagues. Taint his uniform. Have mercy, Mr Director. He's innocent. Have mercy. Give me the key and you can keep the hole puncher. Alright then. That's him, Mr Director. He's the guilty one. Take him away. At my order. Guns at your feet. I'm innocent. -Prepare. Long live the subway, long live France. Long live the subway, long live France. I'm innocent. I can't do this. I can't do this to the company. We had to interrupt your walk. Today's the big day. Already? -Do you feel alright? Good. This should become the best Monday of your life. Tell me what you wish. I have to work and I'm already late. You'll never have to work again. Bourdin's dead, long live Le Normand. Three francs, sir. I'm assuming this can't be delivered before tomorrow morning. No, sir. Is it printed matter? -No, an alibi. What are you doing? What's wrong? -Open up. I can't go on. Open up. -It's Bourdin. Open up. He's sick. Open up. -I'm not allowed to. You can see he's sick. Look. Open up. He fainted. -No, I can't. What's wrong, Bourdin? Don't you feel well? Hands on your heads, gentlemen. Well done, Le Normand. You can get up. The idiot really fainted. Hurry, we're 20 seconds behind. Feeling better? To faint without warning your friends... That means a rewrite. Reality always surpasses fiction. With my help, your book will become a lot better. It's great fun to drive a subway train. Really, this is what it was all about for me. I could keep going until the end of the line. Attention, we'll arrive in ten seconds. To your positions and accept the money like normal. One word or movement and you're dead. We'll get the guards. When I come home, she's asleep and I miss out. You're lucky. Mine waits for me. What's this? They already called. You're over a minute late. We were held up at Bastille. Are you alright? -Yes, I am. Why didn't Bastille call then? Bourdin. Bourdin was in the money train. Have you gone mad? -I really saw him. Another nervous breakdown. -We're going to sleep. Such nonsense. I swear I saw him. Get down or they'll see you. Don't hit too hard. He's a buddy. They did it. Like in Bourdin's 'M?tropolitain Story'. 'M?tropolitain Story', what are you on about? That's the name of his book. On Mondays, people buy their week tickets. 600 million worth of change. They stole the daily takings. Why do you think he didn't return the key? I can prove it. The phone line has been cut. The phone line's been cut. She's crazy. Hello, Bastille? They killed them. Why did they do that? Open the trunk. Open it. How far are we? -At the fourth bag. We're two minutes behind schedule. You know what disastrous consequences that can have. They've sounded the alarm at Finance. And the Austerlitz station master will be wondering where the money train is. We have to hurry. Your presence by my side is nice, but unnecessary. It would be desirable if you could accelerate the operation. What will my colleagues think? Unfortunately, you have appearances against you. For them, you'll be Bourdin the traitor. More or less. A bastard, right? Shall I say what I really think? You're an imbecile. A sublime imbecile. You don't impress me with your fancy ways. Get that bag. I have to make a call. A hold-up. -Bourdin's been kidnapped. But I know how the book ends. Are you coming, boss? -I'm not the boss. He is. They forced me. -Don't even try, bastard. Careful, a train. Hide. Careful. Don't push. Papers, please. What's wrong, officer? We're on the way to a ball. The takings of the subway were stolen. -That's unbelievable. One, two, three, four... One's missing. Look for yourself. Where's the fifth bag? I should be very happy... but I feel a certain dissatisfaction. Of course, there's a bag missing. -One more or less, that's alright. It's more than 100 million. I regret that I'm only an actor in this game. I may get the money, but you get the fame. I wonder where that fifth bag is. -Forget about it. A little adjustment to your text. The bag's lost. That's how things go. Impossible. It should be here. I prepared everything well. I get it. It got stuck on the Austerlitz Bridge. That must be it. Come on board. I don't care about the money and neither do you. We have to wait for it. It will be taken by the current. I'm going there. It's not far. -Come back. I want to know what happened. Don't be stupid. Or I'll have to kill you. Hands up. You're surrounded. Resistance is futile. Hands up. You're surrounded. Resistance is futile. FANTASTIC HOLD-UP IN SUBWAY FILIPPI ACQUITS BOURDIN 'he was my alibi' METROPOLITAIN STORY ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD BOURDIN ONE YEAR SUSPENDED I bought the copyright for Canada. How are you? Do you recognize me? Who's that? -The fifth bag. The fifth bag. Is that you?
