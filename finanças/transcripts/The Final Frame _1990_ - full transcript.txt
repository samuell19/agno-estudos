The Union Jack has now become a totem for football hooligans all over Europe. Here, some rather badly dressed Belgians indulge in a curious ritual before getting down to the nitty gritty of emulating their British counterparts. Staying ahead of the game is the order of the day in the UK. Small gangs organize acts of extreme nastiness against anyone or anything that gets in their way. A ruthless breed, they dress anonymously in expensive leathers and training shoes. Designer weapons play a large part in their street battles, and they are more than ready to use them. If you spot one, do not attempt to arrest him. (SINGING) Unpredictable and violent, swinging from the moon. I was so sophisticated and civilized. It wouldn't choose. But touch my flesh and blood and wonder. Oh, monkey, monkey, what we're going to do? Your own place in the country and no room between these bars for two. Oh, useless experiments from overdeveloped minds. Cultivating screaming packaging the pain. But touch my flesh and blood and wonder. Animal. And my guest in the studio, East. You had a string of hits 18 months ago. East, what's gone wrong? Nothing has gone wrong. I mean, we went on tour, which was great. And then we've been working on the new album. Which is all about this animal rights nonsense. Some of the tracks, yeah. Isn't this a bit of a sudden conversion? Not really, no. So you're not jumping onto this boring old band wagon out of desperation then? Who's desperate, Thea? I'm not sure. Maybe I've got it all wrong. It's just, I thought I'd heard an animal rights spokesperson say that you were about as useful to the campaign as a harpoon maker. Yeah, well there's some right nutters in the animal rights. Everyone knows that. Yeah, well there's some right nutters in the animal rights. Everyone knows that. I'm only interested in the animals. [buzzer] Haddie, can I come in? You did a little job with some friends of mine the other night, I believe. Maybe. You're very professional, we heard. Very discreet. Only trouble is my friends can't pick up the finished article in person. Oh? They ran into a spot of bother yesterday with the police. You hadn't heard? No. No. I thought maybe you had somehow. It's all right then. You give us the tape, and we'll take-- That I can't do, can I? Can't you. Why is that? Making a copy, huh? Now, that isn't very discrete, is it? Good. I like to make sure of things first. Before I go-- Ah! Uh! [smack] You know, we humans are the real beasts, aren't we? Shit! [knocking] Lordy! What happened to you, darling? Occupational hazard. I didn't know you had an occupation, Haddie. Don't knock a man when he's down. Come on in and tell me all about it. The kettle's just boiling. No, listen, I can't just now, Miss Gibson. I just wondered, look after these for us? What is It? It's just some videos. Not dirty are they? As if they would be. [inaudible] I'll look after them for you. Thanks, Miss Gibson. Listen, I've got to rush. You go careful, Sonny. You hear? Christ, what happened to you? Somebody take exception to one of your videos? Which reminds me, when are we getting another one of your nasty little exposes? Have you outgrown us already and sold out? Nah, this place I could never outgrow, VJ. You're a liar, Haddie. We love you for it. Talking of selling out. imagine, she used to work as a waitress for me once. VJ, have you seen John Carlo? Not lately. I'll tell him you're here if I see him. Thanks. Haddie, darling, you look dreadful. Run into some trouble? Oh, you know me. A woman was it? You probably deserved all you got. Tell all. We're over here. You sail too close to the wind, that's your trouble. Paul, Paul, this is Haddie, I told you about him. Oh hello there. Haddie does things with a camera you wouldn't believe. I thought maybe we could help him out, darling. Oh? Haddie needs to get to see East. Why? Ah, hah. We have those backstage passes for the animal rights concert. I don't want to go, do I? Well fine, but I can't guarantee you'll get a seat. Haddie has his ways. What are you up to exactly? I'm doing a piece on animal rights. Who for? Well, Thea said maybe-- [inaudible] to say it's all frightfully hush, hush and under cover, Precious. But I'm sure he'll keep us posted, merci bien. Honestly, darling. What? We don't want him knowing too much at this stage. Why? Let's just say your methods are enough to induce a corporate heart attack. Well, who is he anyway? The boss, the big white chief, Paul Mandell, he's an absolute monster. The veracity of a virus, which is divinely sexy. Phone me tomorrow about those tickets. And if you get to see East, give the old fraud my-- Jean Carlo, sweetheart, where have you been hiding? (SINGING) They tell a story of city [inaudible]. They tell a story. They shout it out loud. The same old story. Yeah. I've had a lot of lucky breaks on TV, of course. But this Chet show's going to be something really new for me. We're going to make serious issues with new music and politics. It's going to be good. Ladies and gentlemen, The Farm. And now for the first of many stars down here this afternoon to lend their support, somebody who needs no introduction whatsoever, but he's going to get one, let's hear it for East! [cheering] Hello. Good to be here. I'm afraid we arranged this in a bit of a hurry, so I don't have my band with me today. But we've got the backing track, so here's my latest single. It's called "Animal." [feedback whine] I've been sabotaged. Last time I was in a football stadium, I caused a riot. Still never mind. While we're waiting, I'll take this opportunity to tell you a bit about our plans for the future. I'm hoping for my own late night TV series later. [music begins] (SINGING) Unpredictable and violent, [explosion] [crowd screams] Get the hell out! [door bell rings] [phone rings] Hello? Who is this? No, he's not. No, I don't see him anymore. Now, listen. No, I'm in bed with someone else as a matter of fact, so if you don't mind. I haven't got a clue where he is. What do you mean? Now look-- VOICEMAIL MESSAGE: Hello, this is Haddie. I'm afraid I'm away for a bit. Leave a message after the tone. Bloody machine. Where are you? It's Judy. Call me. Baz, I need your help. I've got to track down some friends of East's. Didn't have that many, just a few regular girls. I know a few of them. I'll ask around, spread the word like. Thanks, Baz. Don't call us the grapevine for nothing. Oh, and the other thing? Right. I'll [inaudible] for you. Hello. Long time no see. [phone rings] Hello, Last Word Video. May I help you? No, thank you. We've got a drawer full already. Thanks. Bye. You can't leave that there. Why not? Strange looking men are always hanging round your desk, Louise. Not wrapped in [inaudible], thank you very much. Maybe they should be. - Who is it any way? - Oh, him. I never liked him. What are you doing with that? Oh, I don' t know. I'm going to set light to it, probably. Sick you. Hey, I said you can't leave that there. [buzzer] Hi. Do I know you? Look, I'm sorry. Oh heavens, I don't believe it. It can't be. I can explain. It is. It's been so long. What did you say your name was again? Listen, love. The name's Judy. Remember? Judy. Haddie. So. They didn't get you then? Who? Your charming friends. What? I was phoned, or should I say threatened, in the middle of the night. I'm sorry. What are you up to? Where have you been? Oh, nowhere special. I bit off a bit more than I could chew. That's all. What do you want? Apart from the obvious, you mean? That is not even on the agenda any more, Haddie. Can't help it. It's the hormones, love. The only love you've got is that bloody camera. And look at the trouble that gets me into. Little boys and their little toys. Oh, yeah, and what do you call all this then? This, Haddie, is a job, if you'll excuse the language. And I might very easily lose it did you start hanging around here again. OK, OK. I know when I'm not wanted. I um, just wondered. I thought so, a favor. I need your advice. Advice? I don't think you're up to that, Haddie. I have missed you, you know. Yeah, I bet you have. Please. Don't listen to this, Judy. Look, it won't take long. It's just I value your opinion. You know, I never know whether you're brilliantly clever or unbelievably stupid. What have I done now? You know exactly how to get round me, don't you? Naturally. Yeah, I've had a lot of lucky breaks on TV, of course. But this Chet show is going to be something really new for me. We're going to make serious issues with new music and politics. It's going to be good. I know he didn't say much, it's still his last ever interview. You should sell it to his record company or something. No way, it's my trump card. I still don't see why those animal rights people would want to kill him, even if he was a phony. I know. It doesn't make sense. But it happened. I was there. They're not that crazy, surely. It would only take one nutter. I suppose so. Those friends of yours-- Friends they are not. Well, how come they've got my number then? I don't know. Jesus Christ. It's all right. It's me they wanted. Brilliant. Well, you asked me for my advice. I might regret. Hand everything over to the police and go back to taping weddings and christenings. I asked for your advice, not your mother's. This isn't some wanky little piece by some arty independent. I can get somewhere with this. I'd be crazy to drop it now. OK, fine. Just don't involve me, that's all. No of course not. But-- No, Haddie. Look, I have to get back. Some of us have got to work. What are you doing later? I'm busy. Tomorrow? You never give up, do you? Phone me. We set the deadline for next Tuesday. A bit of creative editing may give it more bite, but I'm still not happy with it, Kieron. You need to sharpen up, lad. Ah, Haddie, Thea was looking for you. She said you might have something for us. Oh? Well, I must say, I'm a wee bit disappointed, old chap. I mean, we got you in, free tickets and what have you. You land on the biggest story in town this side of Christmas and then what? Zilch. Not a dicky bird. I'm glad I sent my own crew down there. They get good pictures, did they? Well, a bit grizzly, but not too bad. Nothing on what I've got. So Thea was right. You do have something. Still keeping under cover, huh? You don't think I'm serious, do you? You get something, and I'll take you more seriously than I do my accountant. So, Thea is she in? Thea? No. She's gone back to London. How long for? Oh just for a few days, but keep in touch won't you? I don't know why, but she seems to rate you. Naturally, you should see the video I did at one of her parties. You'll have enough there to blackmail half the city. Trouble is, it's all information and no meaning. The meaning's in the way you do something, VJ. Yeah, but it's not the event that's real anymore. It's what appears on the screen shot. Every terrorist needs his cameraman. It's the cameraman who are the terrorists, in my opinion. Oh, you'd rather not see what's going on then? Why should I need to? That's why you run this club, is it? Buried in pop promos. Exactly. You're such an old cynic. Life's safer that way. You idealists life so bloody dangerous. - You're Haddie, aren't you? - Yeah. You're making a film? A video, yeah. Buzz told us. About East, isn't it? Uh, huh. I knew him, you know. Did you? Oh, yeah. People in this place are always asking you to be in the films, aren't they? I bet half of them are dirty. Do you want me to be in yours? Depends. I could tell you a thing or two about East. I bet you could. Where's your camera? At home. Right. What are we waiting for? Ah, you know, social functions. What, parties and weddings and things? That's how I started out, yeah. Oh, so it's not proper tele then? What's that these days? You mean it's for cable or satellite or something? Yes, something like that. I just pick up stories here and there, sell them where I can. Oh, great. So what stories have you sold then? What? Oh, well you know, few bits and pieces. This is my first really big story, all about me and East. Yeah, sort of. Can I have it? - Maybe. - Here. Ta. Where did you get it? Baz. And all this gear? I have various sponsors. Don't we all? Like the outfit? Very nice. I like expensive clothes, don't you? So, how well did you know him? Is that thing on? Uh, huh. What do you want me to do? Just talk. About East. That's what you came here for. Well, he were great, weren't he? Still haven't got over It Where did you meet him? At this party. Do I look all right? You look fine. When? Last summer. Me brother knew this roadie. They were at school together. And he knew-- well, you know how it goes. So what happened? I got pissed, didn't I? Then we were taken back to East's place out in the country. We? Me and some of the girls. We stayed all weekend. We went back loads of times after that. We weren't tarts or ought like that. He never paid us. Do you want to see a photo? Uh, huh. It was taken last Christmas. That's me with East. And that's Debbie. You should get hold of her. She could tell you loads. Mind you, I ain't seen her for a few days. Don't know where she is. Hold it. I want to show you something. There. What's that he's giving her? Well, I don't know, do I? You were there. So? So, what was in it? Didn't she open it? No. Not in front of all the others. Well, what was it, money, drugs, a bomb even. Oh, give over. So who's that? I thought you were a fan. His bodyguard? Franklin, yeah. OK. So what about animal rights? Did he talk about it? Not much. He ate meat and had plenty of leather jackets. Did he? Well, that's no reason to kill him though, is it. What, you think they did it? I don't know. They like playing about with bombs, that lot, don't they? Well, they usually blow up a laboratory, not pop stars. What are you driving at? That package bothers me. You're worse than the police. Why? Have you talked to them? Just after you. And? What did you tell them? - Nothing. Look, I don't know nothing, do I? Don't you? Well, what about Debbie? What about Debbie? Well, you said she could tell me loads. Yeah, well you'll have to find her then, won't you? You don't know where she is? I was supposed to meet her a few nights ago. She never turned up. I've asked around and no one's seen her. You think something's happened? Look, I never said that, did I? Look, I'm not bothered, am I? Only if you want to help with your film. There was probably lots of money in that package and she's living it up in the Bahamas, hey? Come on. Can I stay here until you get back? I don't know how long I'm going to be. I won't touch ought, I promise. OK, but I'm locking you in. Just in case you had any ideas. I'll go back to sleep, that's all. I'll see you later. All I want is the address. I told you, we couldn't give it to you even if we had it. OK. Let's suppose you did have it, just for argument, how would I get it from you? Well, if we had something from you in writing. Right. Listen, I spoke to Mr Campbell's secretary. She doesn't have it. She must slipped up somewhere, mustn't she? If we don't have the address, then we don't have it, do we? Yeah, well, somebody could be lying, couldn't they? - Ronnie Campbell. - Sorry, sir. This young man-- Send us a tape. Some poor soddie will listen to it. No, I'm from Granada Television. I'm just looking for someone. Franklin. - Franklin? He worked for East. What do you want with him? I need to talk to him. That's difficult at the best of times. Well, where can I find him? He was hired by East. He has to do with us. He hasn't been seen since the funeral. What do you want him for? I'm researching a story. Oh, come up with the killers, have you? No. But I reckon that's-- That's the only story I'm interested in. You're interested in any story about East right now. I just sell records. I leave exploitation to you people. I got an interview with him just before he was killed. Did you now? I better see it then, hadn't I? What? I can't help you, can I otherwise? No, I suppose not. Well, I've got a tape. Fine. But it's only a copy. It's very rough. It's not finished. It's great. Granada you said? Yeah, but it's my address on the box there and it's my copyright. Fine. Now can I get on with my work? But what about Franklin? I've told you, he has nothing to do with us. We're going to mix serious issues with new music and video. It's going to be good. It's going to be great. [explosion] Well, he were great, weren't he? Still haven't got over it. All I know is he won lots of trophies. Which ones? Local, regional, national, international? I don't know. Then there's yours juniors, your novices, your seniors, your amateurs, your professionals, [inaudible] and the other lots. But don't you recognize him, Mr. Timmons? I've told you, not with his clothes on, no. Didn't it register? It was in all the papers. He was blown up. The bloke you're looking for? No. Easat, the pop star. Pop star? Franklin was his bodyguard. Hey, [inaudible] Yes, I remember. Northwest Amateur Middleweight Champion three years ago. Hey, I've got a file out in the back somewhere. It might be in there if we're lucky. I've got better things to do, you know? Sorry, Mrs. Franklin. Here you are. Much good may it do you. Hi. Fantastic. I phoned. Did your mother tell you? No, we don't talk. What do you think? Amazing. You know, you train, and you train, and you train even harder and you look in the mirror and all you see is someone else. Sorry? That is truly an existential experience. Yeah. Yeah. What do you want? You worked for East, didn't you? Oh, so that's what the note was about. You know, she scribbles me little notes and shoves them under the door. I can't even read them. She must be dyslexic. I don't even know why I let her stay here anymore. Is that a camera? It's a video, yeah. - Want a few shots? - Yeah. Great. Pretty good one, yeah? OK. East. Did I worked East? Yeah, for two years. But I didn't guard him well enough, did I? That's why they blame me. I mean he said he was a target, and that's why he hired me. You know, I really tried to be vigilant. I went everywhere with him, absolutely everywhere. You know I'd even hold his hand when he went for a crap. But they still got him, didn't they? Who did? I don't know, whoever, maybe meat merchants, the animal rights, one side or the other. You know he was caught right in the middle. The funny thing was, he never supported direct action. I've told the police, and now I'm telling you, if the media don't like it, well-- What about the girls? Girls, what girls? Cassie and Debbie. I know nothing about any girls. I was there the day he died. I've got it on video. You got what? You and East in the car, the girls by the gates. You gave Debbie a package. What was in it? No idea. It was from East, a present. You said you went everywhere with him. Yeah, I did, but I don't go-- look, turn it off now. Turn it off. Turn it off. OK. Listen, them girls have nothing. They was just fans. I mean, if you're looking for dirt, it ain't right. East was the cleanest guy I ever met. Oh, yeah, which is why Cassie is scared shitless. You make me laugh [inaudible]. - And Debbie's gone missing. - [inaudible] And East is dead. I think you better leave, son. It wasn't anything to do with animal rights, was it? Come on. Get out. What happened? It's your flat, darling, a fire. Someone was trapped and jumped. No chance, not from up there. Oh, shit. This is crazy. Are you going to talk to the police? No. No, I can't. Just look after this for us. You're late. It's Judy, isn't it? I believe we've spoken on the phone. If you're looking for Haddie, I told you. Yes, but you were lying. If you don't go away, I'm going to call the-- I'm not going to touch you. Just give you some advice. Find Haddie and tell them we don't want to get mixed up in whatever he's involved in now. People are getting killed. And that's not our scene, OK? What are you talking about? We don't want anything to do with him, nothing. You're scared. And so should you be. [knocking] Who is that at this hour? Oh, it's you, darling, hold on. Bless us. Look at you. I'm sorry to get you up, Miss Gibson. Well, don't worry, son. I don't sleep that much these days. Come on in and have some tea. You can always stay here. That will get the neighbors talking. I wish I could. I'm not scared of trouble, son. I've had plenty before now. You don't need any more. Where will you go? I don't know. Why don't you go back home for a bit? I know it's not like a proper home, but they'd love to see you, I'm sure. No. They've always been good to you. Too good. Haddie. I'm sorry, but-- I know you've had a shock. You could say that. I would like to know what started that fire. Or who. What do you mean? I don't think that fire was an accident. What I don't know is whether it was meant for me or Cassie. I was the one who locked her in, thought. Well Well, I've still got those things you gave me to look after. Yeah. Well, that's something, hey? It's just been one of those days. Jerry's a bastard. He does that every time. Haddie. Are you all right? My flat's burned down. Your what? Oh, come on, that's bad even for you. You're serious To a cinder. Christ, Haddie, what have you got yourself into? Come on. I need a print of that. Hm, Jim can do it but-- It's that girl, Debbie. I've got to find here. So go to the police. Oh, brilliant. I open my mouth and I get hauled in for that fur job, arson, and God knows what else. But if those animal rights guys are scared-- It's got nothing to do with them. Yeah, well, nobody else thinks that. Maybe not, but I'm onto something. And somebody is on to you. Maybe. I need that print. OK. If it'll help. But for God's sake, Haddie, be careful. What's this? What? Ronnie Campbell. Yeah, he's an ex-client. He's come coming here? Summit often use us. What's wrong? I don't know. I don't want to see him, not yet. Are you all right? Yeah I'm fine. Look, do that print for us? I'll see you later. Try him again. Yeah, is Bill there? - Oh, hello there. - Hi. How's it going? Rough, by the looks of it. It's fine, thanks. Good, good, but when you get something-- Yeah, sure, thanks. --for us. Bill, Ronnie's waiting. Five minutes. What's his name again? What Haddie? Yeah, he's with Grenada, isn't he? Haddie? You're joking. No, he works on his own. Oh, what's he doing here then? His girlfriend, Judy, is one of the tape ups here. Oh, I see. How do you know him? You You know me, Louise, was on the lookout for talent. Talent. He's just burned his flat down, you know. Had this big cardboard cutout thing of East. Set fire to it. Sounds fairly creative. That one's out there and back again. They're the ones to watch. This isn't Beirut, Haddie. The whole bloody city's a war zone if you ask me. You certainly behave as if it is. I'm the intrepid war correspondent, bringing back news of urban violence from the front line. My god. I never realized. They are fanatics out there, Judy, all of them, power crazed fanatics. You can't trust a single soul. That's why you have to got it alone, is it. I have a calling you see, me and my trusty old camera. Oh, Haddie, you're such a saint. It's hard to live with at times. Don't I know it. A saint. I very nearly was too, wasn't I. That poor kid. I tell you, who's ever behind all of this-- look, I know we said just a meal. But can I come back, just tonight? I need a bath. Did I leave a shirt here? You didn't leave anything here. Didn't I? No. That was silly of me. Here. - I gave you this. - So wear it. I want it back though. Later. Suits you. You too. I know. That's why I want it back. Later. Baz. Haddie, How you doing? Who's this? - Judy. Baz. Did Cassie get in touch with you? Yeah. Look, I'm afraid there's been an accident, a fire of my place, gutted. I was out but-- Did she stay, quick bastard. She's dead. She fell, jumped, or out the back. Jesus. I know. Look, I've got to find this girl, a friend of hers, Debbie. Wouldn't trust her either. She ripped me off once. You don't know where we can find her? No idea. She doesn't come down here. Do you know where she lives? Not really. You could ask at Zanega's. Who? It's a restaurant. Yeah, bloody expensive. She works as a waitress or something. Great. Thanks, Baz. Listen, sorry to hear about it. Yeah. It you find her, tell her I want my jacket back. Excuse me. You get out of here. What is it, Rosa? No, it's all right. We're just looking for someone. We're closed. She works here. Come back tomorrow. A girl called Debbie. Do you know her? What do they want? That girl Debbie. Oh? She ain't been in this week. You don't know where she lives, do you? Why? Is she in trouble? No, I don't think so. There's a book in here somewhere. Where's that book? What book is that? The one the address is in. What do they want? They're looking for Debbie. What you want with her? It's private. Oh, yeah, yeah. Do you know her? Look, I don't know who you are. But just leave her alone, OK? Here it is. You just need to-- No you don't. Piss off! - Look, you don't understand. - Don't I? Oh, God, he's off again. [inaudible] Sniffing around people. Call the boss. He's [inaudible] again. Did they follow us? No, I don't think so. I never learn with you, do I? [inaudible] I'm going home. That guy knew something. We nearly got ourselves fricasseed back there. Who else has been sniffing around? We are not going back. Well, If you can't take the heat, love-- If I can't take the what? My god, you're incredible. Well, thanks for a terrific evening, Haddie. I won't ask you back. Oh, and since you didn't have the wit to pick it up, you better have this. Judy. Judy! Hey, look at him. Best bit of [inaudible] I've seen all night. That's the third time this week, Bernie. Over. [inaudible] Well, avoid the bloody flyover then. Return to base. You've got two for [inaudible] range, over. Ranger, over. Be half and hour at least, love. What did you want? Is this 103? Last time I looked. Are there any flats above here? I wouldn't call them flats, love. How do I get to them? Bit late for visiting, isn't it? You can go through there, if you like. Mind the rubbish, though. [radio] I said, ring the top bell twice. Over. [radio] How should I know? Left door, right, try them both. [knocking] Debbie? Debbie? Haddie? Hello? Haddie? Are you there? Oh, no. Yeah, police, please. Oh, damn! On top of that, I'm being followed. By the police. I shouldn't wonder. Well, whoever Who it the only one looking for this Debbie girl. So what's it all about then? Well it's not anything to do with animal rights, that's for sure. Pity, what is it then? I don't know. Outraged fan? East was no John Lennon. Fantastic. Yeah. You've only just scratched the surface. Yeah, but there's something there. And I can't get to it unless I have some backup. I've lost all my equipment. But not the tapes. Thank Christ, or the camera. Right. Let's go for it. You have a choice. You can either do it informally, no finance, right? Just the use of the equipment and the facilities. If you come up with the business, then we'll talk again. Or we can heap money on you now, tie you up so tight in red tape, and have to wipe your ass in triplicate. That's a choice? Sure. If it was my choice, I'd take the money. But I have a way with red tape. A few years back, I'd do exactly what we're going to do now. Which is what? Thank your lucky stars I don't mind bending a few rules. What's going on here? They're building a brand new studio down here. We just got a new satellite franchise. I might be working in Amsterdam soon. Here we are. You know how it all works. Yeah. Great. Thanks. You'll need an entry card. I'll get one for you, OK. Aren't you going a bit overboard for our Haddie? I thought that was what you wanted me to do. Well, I thought we might get a nice little piece from him for the program. I think we might have something much bigger than that. You've dealt with kids like him before. They are five minute wonders. Well, isn't that what youth programming is all about? Of course it is. But that doesn't justify encouraging the sweet little innocents and then dropping them. Who said anything about dropping him? If he delivers, Thea. Well, we all have to do that, don't we? I don't believe a word of it. My flat was gutted and that girl died. It's pure soap opera. It's too much. It's true. Absurd and true. That's even better. Just what I need. It's just the stuff second rate legends are made of. Look, Ronnie, I need this interview. Sentimental crap, that's all my people have been giving me. But soap opera, that's more like it. That's what he was really like. He'd have loved it. You'll talk about the girls on camera then? All right. Just for you, Haddie. The celibacy song was not a con. It was a point of view, that's all. East was a normal guy who happened to be concerned about things. Who wouldn't these days? Hello there. How's it going? Oh, fine. Mr. Big, I see. Yeah. Cynical bastard. So busy playing games, he doesn't know what's real anymore. I don't know, Haddie. Look at you. It's so humiliating being upstaged by a mere boy, when one is oozing with so much talent oneself. What do you mean? Paul seems really taken with you, sweetheart. Mind you, he always bent over backwards to get East on screen. God knows why. I use the word bent metaphorically of course. Paul is fearfully heterosexist. Anyway, darling, keep me up to date, will you? It all sounds wildly intriguing. Will do. And congrats all round, hey? Thanks. That gossip about the girls was exaggerated and one sided. I got pissed, didn't I? Then we were taken out to East's place out in the country. Me and some other girls. We stayed all weekend. We went back loads of times after that. This is the young man that phoned. From the television? That's right. Hello. Make yourself comfortable. Thanks. He left us this house. We don't like it very much, do we? The wife doesn't sleep too well here. Too quiet. I like to be a bit nearer the shops, you know. We can't really sell it though, can we? No, I suppose not. Were you a friend of his? No. No, I wasn't. But I knew someone who knew him, a girl, Cassie. No. I don't like her. I don't trust her. She's only young. Still don't trust her. What about Debbie? Do you know her? Oh, yes. She was worse. You haven't seen her lately? No one has come near or by. He knew something was going to happen to him, you know. I don't know about that, dear. He was scared for months. He drank. That was the trouble. He drank because he was scared. We never really knew what he was up to, did we? You knew the girls, though? Well, all pop stars have girls hanging round, don't they? Ronnie told us-- He's the [inaudible] records. Did Ronnie get the girls then? Get them? They weren't prostitutes. I didn't like them, but they weren't-- If you want to know about the girls, you ask that bodyguard chap, Franklin. Like an old mother hen to him, he was. Really? Right. I thought you were going to film us. Well yes. They interviewed all kinds of people when he died. But not us. You were spared probably. Did you think we'd got naught to say? Not of course not. It's just that out of thought-- Yeah. I used to think, when I saw people on telly, after some disaster or whatever giving interviews crying, I used to think, how could they at a time like that? I thought television people were just using them. But since our son died, we've wanted to tell everybody what it was like. I don't care if it embarrasses them or they find it upsetting. I want them to know what happened to us. Judy, I need to talk. Not now, Haddie. I've just come from East's parents. I don't what I'm doing. So what's new? I've got this horrible feeling it's all going to end up as one of Ronnie's pop promos or something. Then drop it. No. It's too important. Important Important to who? OK, yeah, it's important to me. Why? Because I had an idea and I went for it. I can't just walk away, not now. And what about me? You don't want to have anything to do with it. You made that perfectly clear. I don't want to have anything to do with people getting killed, Haddie. And if you had any sense-- Yeah, well, hat I don't have, do I? I get these crazy ideas. You won't let go. I'll let go if I have to. If it suits you, you mean. I'll let go when I know I'm not getting anywhere, Judy. Meaning me. We should never have got back together again. I didn't know we had. Well, maybe not. Anyway, This time it's my turn to let go. This is getting us nowhere, Haddie. What do you mean? I've been offered a job abroad. Where? Amsterdam. You're going to Holland? Well, I wasn't looking for i. It was offered. Jesus. Editor. Some new satellite channel. I see. No, Haddie. You don't see. That's your trouble. You're too busy playing the great detective. Well, I'm damned if I'm going to play the dumb blonde who sits and waits and gets threatened and her flat turned over and then ends up having to identify the body. No one should have to do that, not even me. Yeah, what else? I was there the day he died. I've go it on video. You gave Debbie a package. I have no idea. It was from East, a present. But you said you went everywhere with him. Yeah, I did, but not there. You know what I mean? Turn it off now. Turn it off. [knocking] Oh, it's you again. He ain't here. Do you know where he is? He never tells me a thing. I did happen to notice this. He left it in the bathroom, not that I was snooping, of course. He's here. Well, that's today's date, isn't it? Thanks. If you see him, tell him I'm locking this door at midnight. Front double bicep. Front lat spread. Side chest. Debbie. Who are you? A friend of Cassie's. Oh, yeah? You're he one that killed her, aren't you, you bastard? Well listen, tell him to forget it. Forget the money. I don't want anything. I don't know anything about any football field. East didn't tell me anything. I don't know anything at all. Just take the sodding thing and let me go. Debbie, wait! Debbie, [inaudible]. Debbie! Debbie, wait. Get off. A ruthless breed, they dress anonymously in expensive leathers and training shoes. Designer weapons play a large part in their street battles, and they are more than ready to use them. If you spot one, do not attempt to arrest him. Hello, girls. This is a laugh, isn't it? My new camera. You can play all kinds of games with these, hey? Well let me tell you about a little game me and a certain Paul Mandell have been playing. It goes back a few years. Paul was a fresh young TV producer then. And in order to make a nice exciting little program about football, he paid me and a few mates to spice things up a bit in the stadium. Trouble was, things got a little bit out of hand. Never mind, program was a great success. Of course, if anyone ever found out what he'd done, well he might find himself in a spot of trouble. But I'd never say anything. Paul's been a good friend to me. And it's been a very profitable relationship up till now. Only lately that bastard's been getting too big for his boots. He hasn't been playing the game properly. He hasn't been giving me what I want. I need to be in the headlines again. That's where I belong. Only Paul says he'd be putting me there in a way I won't much like. Well, some people lose their sense of reality, don't they? Think they can erase a person as easy as erasing a tape. Well, this little tape's my insurance, girls. If anything happens to me, use it. Carry on the game. It's called blackmail. You bastards. You know your friend, Haddie. Yes? Turns out he's an absolute maniac. What do you mean? The police are after him. What for? They reckon he killed that girl in his flat, and her friend, the one he was looking for. I don't believe it. Well, he was seen chasing her. And she's been found apparently, stabbed with a bread knife. It's got his fingerprints on it. You're joking. Why? Outraged fan, it seems. Yes, of course. Lucky he didn't blow us all up. Jesus, you're not seeing Haddie. No. Go on. Well, East. Who knows? Do you still have his tapes? Yes, of course. It would make a great program. What a good idea. Can we have a clear shot please? OK? Turn over. Play back. 14, take one. OK guys, action.
