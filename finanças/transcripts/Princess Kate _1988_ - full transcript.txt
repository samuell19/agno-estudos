[classical piano music] [birds chirping] [girls talking and laughing] ["Fur Elise" by Beethoven] [laughing] [champagne cork popping] - [Gran] Happy birthday, darling. - [Robbie] Happy birthday. Why can't I have some? - Happy birthday. - [Kate] Thanks, dad. [children chatter and laugh] - Happy birthday, darling. - Thanks, Granny. - [Sarah] Ooh, what is it? Let's see. - [Bob] Take some photos, Robbie. - [Sarah] Oh, it's beautiful. - [Gran] It's very old. - [Robbie] Smile. - [Amanda] Champagne is wonderful, Mr. McLelland. - [Bob] Careful girls, it'll make you tipsy. [glass clanging] - First champagne birthday for our daughter, Kate. [group cheers and applauds] On a more serious note, despite the fact that Kate has got a mind of her own, - [Sarah] Yeah [laughs]. [Kate laughs] - It's hard to imagine the past 14 years without her. For all Anne and I have had our grumbles and groans, a marriage wouldn't be a marriage without someone to love, and build a future for. A toast: to Kate. - [Group] To Kate. - [Robbie] Dad, can we go for a sail? - [Kate] Dad, I only asked for a windsurfer. - This is its big brother. - [Robbie] Wow, I wanna get on! Come on, Kate, get on. - [Amanda] My God. I can't believe this. - [Sarah] Kate, your birthday present? It's incredible. - [Amanda] It's beautiful. Princess Kate. [Kate laughs] [girls chattering] - [Bob] Girls, could one of you put a safety jacket on Robbie? - [Robbie] Aww, dad. - [Bob] Do as you're told, boy. - There's no way I'll get anything like this for my birthday. - Well, it's not just mine, it's really for Dad. - [Bob] Watch your step there, girls. Kate, watch the wind change. [engine buzzing] Watch it, Kate. - [Jamie] Eh, look at this. - [Amanda] They're heading straight for us! - [Bob] Get out of the way! - Hey girls, wanna come for a ride? - No, thanks. - [Jamie] Hey, you wanna swap boats? - Westies! - If you don't know the rules, you shouldn't be on the water. - [Jamie] I'd give you a good time. - [Bob] Louts. - We're not louts. Princess Kate, come on, jump, jump! - What's a Westie? - Someone from the western suburbs. [girls talking and laughing] ["Chopsticks" playing] - One, two, three, four, five, six... That's it, keep going, come on. - Oh, come on. - Yes it is, do it again. - One, two, three, four, five, six... One, two, three... - Yay, we did it! Really, keep going. - Half a million Australian dollars worth of cooking pads, and we've haven't got one sale, mate. Right. Well, the good news is this: You've got two days to get out there and sell them. And just to help you think it through clearly, you do know what your current superannuation payments are then? And don't forget you've got two kids at private school, mate. - [Robbie] One, two... - [Voiceover] And how old were you? - [Voiceover] Well, I was only 19. And I was told I had to adopt him out. I was told I had no right to keep the baby, because... - What's the formula for the volume of a cylinder? - Here, look it up in the book. - Well, don't you know? - Yeah, but you won't learn if I tell you. - [Anne] Kate, this is clean. - [Voiceover] How do you feel about that now? - [Voiceover] I feel angry. - [Voiceover] Have you tried to find your son? How old would he be now, Mary? - [Voiceover] 14. Yeah, yes, I've tried. I dream about him nearly every night. I used to stand at the school gates waiting for kids his age to come out, and just look at em and wonder if any of em were him. You know, like they expect you just to walk away and leave your baby, forget all about him. I couldn't stop crying... - Turn that off. How can you study with that blaring in the background? - [Voiceover] And I thought I was gonna die. - [Anne] Should have thought of that before you got yourself pregnant. [door slams] - [Robbie] All right then, what's the difference between vertebrate and an invertebrate? - [Anne] I know, one's got a backbone, and the other hasn't, ha. - [Robbie] We're doing it at school. Wicket's a vertebrate. - [Anne] No, he's a toy. - [Robbie] He isn't, he's a vertebrate. Aren't you, Wicket? - [Anne] Oh God, you're a baby. - [Robbie] I am not. Read me a story, please? - [Anne] All right. Where is it? Now, where are we up to? Here we are, chapter three. "I make acquaintance of my uncle. "Presently, there came a great rattling of chains "and bolts and the door was cautiously opened..." [classical piano music] - [Girl] Here they come. [boys chattering] - [Jamie] Hey girls, how are ya? - [Josh] G'day girls, how you going? - [Girl] Hello. - [Josh] Nice day. - [Jamie] Radical. Wait, wait, check out the one in the gray. - [Josh] How you doing? - [Jamie] Check her out, ahh, unreal. - [Josh] Check out the one with the sunnies. - What'd he say? - Radical, baby. - [Josh] Shut up, Jamie. - [Jamie] [mumbles] Ahh, I dig the uniform. - [Girl] Bye. Arrivederci. - Audios, senoritas. - He's not a dag, I think he's nice. - Come off it, Amanda, he's a dag. [girls chatting] - Did you see that adoption program last night? - Mmhmm. - I freaked. I made mum and dad show me my birth certificate. - Why? - To prove I was theirs. - What are you talking about? You and your mum look like twins. - We don't. - You do! - Thanks a lot, Amanda. - What's up with her? - Missy McLoud's adopted. - Is she? - Don't you know? - She's got awful hair. - She always eating, she never seems to stop. - That's not because she's adopted. [bell clanging] - [Girl] What've you got now? - [Girl 2] Um, history, I think. [girls talking and laughing] [teacher calling out instruction] - Bye. - Bye. - Look, you know you've got no intention of paying me on time. Who do you think I am? Santa Claus? Hey, what's say we sail down to Lane cove this weekend? Pack a picnic, and have lunch at the -_--_ river. Would you like that, princess? - A lot of kids at school watched that program on adoption. - What program? - A program. Mum saw it. - Well, you know those programs, they're usually sensationalized. - Bob, shouldn't you be getting ready? Clive and Edwina will be here soon. - Saturday, right? Saturday. [footsteps departing] [piano playing] - [Bob] Anne, they're on their way up. [ice clinking, liquid pouring] - Most of my friends look a bit like their parents. I don't look like either of you. [doorbell ringing] - Lots of children don't look like their parents. - [Kate] Who? - Lots. Don't be silly, Kate. - [Edwina] Hello. - [Anne] Hello, darling, come on in. - Wouldn't matter. - [Edwina] Oh, it's my fault. - [Anne] Bob's through there. - [Clive] A kiss for me, too. - [Edwina] You're gorgeous. - [Clive] Bob! [chatting and laughing] - Right, fresh coffee. - Oh, coffee, I feel like a [mumbles]. - Yeah. - As you know, Felicity saw the exhibition, don't you know. - [Anne] In Paris? - [Edwina] Mmhmm. We'd get lost there anyway. [chatting in the other room] - Hey, dad? Why didn't you tell me? - We were going to tell you, but... Not until you were much older. It isn't important, princess. You're our daughter. We love you. - Who are my real parents? - We don't know. [cry catches in Kate's throat] - Are you all right? You look as though you've seen a ghost. - Ahh... Ice... Some more ice. - Uh, I think you'll find some in the other fridge. Excuse me, darling. - You told her? - What was I supposed to do? - You could have just said, "no, of course you're not adopted," and that would have been the end of it. - I can't lie, not to Kate. - Sometimes you have to lie to protect people. If everyone went around blabbing the truth, life would be impossible. - I can't lie to Kate. [ice dropping] She's really upset. [door opens gently] - Kate? I can't see that it really matters. We don't think of you any differently. - Than if I was your own flesh and blood? - Than if you weren't adopted. If I were you, I'd thank my lucky stars that I was taken in by parents who wanted me and could give me a decent life. - Who are my... Real parents? - We honestly don't know. Or care. And you shouldn't either. - I must find out who my real mother is. - Kate, that's impossible. - I'm going to. - [Anne] Why? - Because I have to know. - I don't think we should talk about this while you're upset, darling. Have a good night's sleep, and see how you feel in the morning. [quiet voice talking on radio] - [Anne] Robbie, Kate's going to be late for school, hurry her up, darling. - She's gone. ["Fur Elise" by Beethoven] [children laughing and playing outside] - What's wrong? Kate? - I'm adopted. Don't you ever tell anyone. - True? You could be the daughter of someone famous. - Sarah... - Your dad could be a pop star, your mum an opera singer. - Sarah! - I bet you it was somebody interesting. She wouldn't be like that-- - Like what? - Well, like that woman we saw on TV. - Why wouldn't she? They're the sort that get their babies adopted, aren't they? - [Sarah] Kate... - And the fathers are Westies with tattoos, who get them pregnant and then nick off, right? - You don't look like a Westie. - I'm getting a bit tarty, getting a bit fat maybe? - Kate, don't. - Just don't tell anyone, right? [cries and sniffs quietly] [notes play quietly] [door opens] [sorrowful piano music] [rain dropping] - Is Robbie adopted? - No. It sometimes happens that way. - You don't think we think any the less of you, do you? - You were so... Special to us, Katie. We'd be trying for five years. - Got one of your own in the end. - You are our own. Just as much as Robbie is, if not more so. [scoffs] You should have seen me the day the adoption papers arrived. - He had all the relatives over, drinking French champagne, and those were the days when we couldn't afford it. - I wanna found out who my mother is. - Why? - Because I do. - [Bob] Princess, we brought you up, why do you want to know who she is? - Because she's my real mother. - Your real mother? She gave you away. Anne is your real mother. - [Anne] If we gave permission, she could find out some details now. - [Bob] You told me she had to wait until she was 18. - [Anne] Not if we both give permission. - [Bob] Well, she's too young to cope. - [Anne] Might put her mind at rest. - [Bob] The last thing we want is for her to have divided loyalties at the age of 14. She's just a kid. - They won't give her the mother's name. - What if she finds out? - She can't. - You know how determined she is. - Well... it won't be a catastrophe if she does. - [Bob] What if she wants to live with her? - [Anne] I'm sure she won't. - [Bob] She better not. We've spent a fortune on private school fees, all the dances, swimming, piano tuition... - Bob... You're talking about our daughter as if she's an investment. [Bob sighs] - I would rather she did wait until she's 18, she's too young to handle it just yet. - [Anne] The bill for the car repairs arrived today. - [Bob] How much? - Too much. Why don't we sell it? - We have to have a decent car. Impresses the clients. - Slow down, Bob. You'll kill yourself. - Gran rang this morning, wondering why you haven't been to see her lately. She says your visits brighten up her whole weekend. Don't punish Robbie because you're unhappy, darling. You've been horrible to him the last few days. - I'm not punishing him. - You won't let him come near you. - I don't want him near me. - Kate, he's your brother, he thinks the world of you. - [Kate] He's not my brother. [children calling out to each other] [whistle blows] - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - You sure? - Yep. - Kate, will you sit out the next quarter please, I'm putting Sally in. - [Girl] Bad luck, Katie. - I wasn't the only one not playing well, why does she always pick on me? - God, she's cranky lately. - Well... Promise you won't tell anyone? - Yeah. - Everything's so expensive here. - You oughta see the prices in Paris. Mum took me to this place on the Champs Elysee, the cheapest dress was a thousand dollars. - What was it like? - Excellent. - I'd be too scared to wear anything like that. So how much are you allowed to spend? - Mum said not to worry, she said "for your 14th birthday party, "I want you to look classy." - Oh yuck Katie, that looks Westie. - Ahh look, there's nothing we really like here, how bout we go to Masons? - Yeah. - [Benedicte] I have to go home and help dad with the boat. Sorry. - Kate, come on, we didn't mean it. - Katie! - Don't lie, Sarah, I know you told them. Yeah some friend you turned out to be. No, I'm not coming over, I'm going by myself. [pop music playing] [kids laughing and talking] [muffled conversation] - What about ya? - G'day [laughs]. - Jamie, come on, mate. - You look really great tonight, Katie. Your hair looks nice, I love the dress. You don't look too bad, for a Westie. Katie, I'm sorry. - [Bob] Julian Westlake? - [Anne] I'm sure he didn't mean it. - He meant it, mum. - Little snob. - [Kate] They all think the same. - I'm sure they don't. - They do! You don't know what it's like. You don't spend your holidays shopping in Paris, or skiing in Switzerland, then you're nobody. - I was brought up in the western suburbs, what's wrong with that? - You were the one who called those boys louts. - [Bob] When? - When we were on the boat. - I told you we should never have sent her to that school, they're a pack of snobs. - I'm sure it's not as bad as you think. - It is. I don't belong there. I don't know who I belong to. [classical piano music plays] - Gran! - [Gran] Darling, how lovely to see you. The nurse set up tea for us down here. - You're a great collector, Gran. Is that mum? - Mmhmm. I made that dress. Look at the smocking. You don't see work like that these days. [Gran chuckles] She wore that the first time she sang in the Sunday school choir. Before she got thrown out [laughs]. She couldn't sing a note [laughs]. Not like you, you had a beautiful voice. When you were four, you'd come over to my place, and you'd listen to my Gilbert and Sullivan records for hours. You could sing anything from those operas. Three Little Maids was your favorite. - Did you have a good voice, Gran? - Me? No. Everyone in our family was a frog, croakers. - I know I'm adopted. - Robbie paid me a visit. He told me what's been going on. Take me for a walk, dear. I might be able to help. - Do you know anything about my real mother? - Why do you want to know? - [sighs] I need to know. I must know. - I know her name, and I'm the only one in this family who does. - How did you find out? - I'm a collector. This is for you. I've been saving it. That was you, Baby Tribe. - Where did you get this? - From the hospital where you were born. They put name tags on all baby's wrists so they don't mix them up. - But how did you get this? - Matron brought you into her office wrapped in a pink blanket, you were beautiful. - Did someone drop this? - No, no dear, just before matron handed you to Anne, she cut it off your wrist and threw it in the waste paper basket. Anne wasn't supposed to see it, of course, nobody was. - You took it? - Well, they were all busy, fussing around, signing papers and packing you into your carry cart, nobody saw me. - Gran, you devil [laughs]. - [Gran] I thought it might come in useful one day. - It will. It will. Do you know anything else about my real mother? - She just passed her high school certificate. - How do you know? - Well, Anne's a bit of a snob, dear, she always has been. [Kate laughs] She'd embarrass me sometimes. - What did she say? - Well, she asked the matron if there was anything wrong with you, mentally. - [scoffs] And what did the matron say? - Oh, she was quite cross. She said, "in this hospital, they didn't "give out babies with brain damage." She said your mother was a very clever girl, she'd just passed her high school certificate. I think major matron was a bit sorry she'd let that slip out. - Mmm. Hello? Can you help me? I'm adopted. - [Sarah] Kate, everyone's really down on Julian for what he did to you. - [Kate] Yeah, I bet. - He's a jerk. Benedicte's not inviting him to her party now. - I should have hit him over the head with the vodka bottle. [both laugh] - Where are you going? - I found out my real mother's name. - Really? - Yeah, but the government won't help you unless you've got your parents' written consent. Or there's this voluntary organization that might help me trace her. - [Sarah] Are you going there now? - Dad thinks I'm playing tennis all day. - Do you want me to come with you? Oh, how are you getting there? - By helicopter, how do you think? - Bye. [girls talking to each other] - Where'd you get your denims? Must have cost heaps, eh? - Not really. - Not really, give her a break. - Do any of you know where Macintosh Avenue is? - Yeah, I'll show you outside. - Thanks. - So, where you from Princess? - Um, Elizabeth Bay. - [girls] Mmmm [laughing]. - Cassandra... [children yelling and playing] - Mum, mum, mum! - [Cheryl] Coming. - [Kate] Hello, my name's Kate McLelland. I talked to Mr. Kelly on the phone. - I told you on the phone, I can't help you unless your parents give their consent. Why didn't they get in touch with me? - They wouldn't. - That's a bit of a problem. Why do you want to find out about your natural parents, Kate? - I just want to. Since I found out I'm adopted, I can't stop thinking about them. I found out my mother's name. - How? - Gran knew. She pinched my name tag. - Smart Gran. - [Boy] Daddy? - It's not gonna help you much, though. - [Kate] I thought you people could help. - Not without your parents' consent. - Ooh, you're just like the government people. I can't go on their contact registry until I'm 18 either. [sighs] - Calm down. Are you hungry? Look, I know how you feel, but there's a very good reason for all this secrecy. - What? - Mmm, your natural mother might have been under a lot of pressure to have you adopted. Mothers don't give up their babies easily, you know. - Well, why did she? That's what I wanna find out, why did she. - I dunno. Maybe her parents pressured her, maybe a church pressured her, maybe she was too sick and poor, bit depressed... - No, I don't care what she was, I just wanna find her. - Did it ever occur to you that she mightn't want to see you? - I'm her daughter. - Maybe she feels guilty. - [Cheryl] Come on darling, eat it up. - Do you know why we do this counseling? 14 years ago, we gave up our son for adoption. - Why? - We were 19, just kids. Not married, not sure if we wanted to be. Cheryl wanted to keep him, I was scared. Selfish. Three years later we did get married, and then we decided to try and find him. We searched everywhere. - With no luck? - I was just telling Kate what a pathetic bloke I was, 14 years ago. - You tell her the rest? We found him. We've seen him, we know where he lives. - But he doesn't know us. We had to promise his parents we wouldn't come near him. They're scared stiff. Like your parents, probably. - Come on, dad, give us a push. - Yeah dad, really hard. - Oh, they love coming here. I suppose they wonder why we come so often, it's a long way to come for a park. - He lives just over there. He trains in the pool here on Saturdays. - Here he comes. - Looks a bit like you. - Looks even more like Barry's brother. - Why don't they tell him he's adopted? - They don't think he's ready yet. - I feel like telling him myself. - No, you have to be patient. Cry about it sometimes. - Come on boy. [people talking and laughing] - Excuse me. Oh, excuse me. - Is it bad? - Yeah. - You didn't take them in time. - All right. Look, if I can cling to this tennis racquet during the entire one, we'll have nothing to worry about. - I don't care about the money, Bob, you work too hard. - Yeah... - [Kate] Excuse me. Mum? - Darling. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - How was tennis? - Fine, um, can I have a word? - You can't be Kate? Hasn't she grown into a lovely young woman? - Kate! How's school going? - Fine. - [stammers] I think you know my daughter, don't you? - Oh, yes. - Hermione, she's in year seven. [laughs politely] - Mum, can I talk to you for a second, please? - Mmhmm, excuse us. - Benedicte said that she's adopted? Did you hear? - I didn't go to tennis, mum, but I met these terrific people. They're volunteer workers for this adoption organization, and they help people like me. - What? - It's all right, they're really great people, and they want to meet you. - Why? - Because they understand. You see, their elder son was adopted, and now he's 14 and they found him. They don't want to kidnap him or anything, they just want to know him. - But how did you-- - Like I wanna know my parents. - Kate, we've been through all that. - Please come with me to the contact register. I can't do anything without your permission. - I wish you'd get over this obsession of yours, Kate. It's causing your father a lot of distress. - It's not an obsession, mum, it's quite normal. Barry said-- - I'm sure Barry is an admirable person, but neither he nor you have any idea of the stress this is causing your father. Did you know his business is going really badly? Did you know that he's sick? - Well, he doesn't look sick, he's out there drinking with his friends. - He's so worried he's thinking about selling the apartment. - He just bought a yacht. - He shouldn't have. He only did that because he loves you. - Well that's a stupid reason, because I didn't even want it. - I don't want to hear one more word about your adoption, Kate. It's not important, and I want you to forget it. Do you understand? - How many are there? - 32. - Well, what are we gonna ask them? - Well, we can't exactly ask them if they're related to the Tribe girl, who had a baby girl adopted in April, 1974, can we? - No. - Her high school certificate. - What? - She got her HSC. Come on. [rapid classical piano music plays] - I think I've got her. - Where? Tribe, Glenys May. Passes all subjects in the HSC at Penrith high school, in 1973. - But what about those other Tribes? - They're all boys. [squeals with excitement] - No one by the name of Glenys, no one at all? Thank you, bye bye. - Kate, that's the ninth call. What if she's moved to the country or into state? - Yeah, we'll try those Tribes, too. Let's get through the Sydney ones first. [sighs] - [clears throat] Hello, Mr. Tribe? My name's Kate McLelland, and I'm trying to get in contact with an old school friend by the name of Glenys Tribe. Yeah, she did her high school certificate in 1973 at Penrith high school. Is she? Greg Mathieson, you're terrific, I'll wait. - [Sarah] Well? - He's gone to get the phone number. She's married and she lives in Mulgrave. Oh, hello. Uh huh... Yeah, I've got that, thank you. Thank you very much, goodbye. It's her. I've got a number. - Well, you gonna ring her? - I spose. - [Sarah] What did the dad sound like? - Normal. - Well spoken, or pretty rough? - What does it matter? - I didn't mean it like that. - [Kate] Yes, you did. - You're so touchy. - Yeah, well it's about time you and the others realize that everyone west of Darling Point doesn't have two heads. - What are you gonna do if your real mother's nice? - What do you mean? - [Sarah] Are you gonna live with her? - I don't know. [coins clicking together] - [sighs] Do you want me to do it? - No, I will. - Well go on! - Cheryl said there are things you shouldn't say. I just wanna make sure I get it right. [Sarah sighs] - What things? - You've gotta be careful. Hello, Glenys? Glenys Mathieson? My name's Kate McLelland. Kate McLelland, that name won't mean anything to you, but I'd like to leave my number. It's 02 347 1064. Have you got that? What I'm about to ask, you might not be able to answer right now, but um, would you call me back on that number please, after four this afternoon? Does the date the 29th of April, 1974 mean anything to you? - What happened? - She said I had the wrong number. I'm sure we've got the right person. Mum? Mum? [plays melody] Hello? Glenys? It's me, Kate. Please don't hang up. I don't mean any harm, really. Will you write to me, then? Please, I only want to talk to you. Please! - [Voiceover] The country, said Darcy, can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. In a country neighborhood, you move in a very confined and unvarying society, but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them forever. Yes, indeed, cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighborhood. I assure you that there is quite as mu-- Kate, are you listening? - [Voiceover] Kate, what is it? - [Voiceover] Are you all right? - It was just fabulous. - I didn't see it, but I heard Robert Redford was dreadful. - No he wasn't, who said that? - [Woman] Glenys. - [Glenys] Yes, I think he was far too old for the part. - Oh, you don't wanna listen to Glenys, she lives in the bush. [women laugh] - Hello. - Hi. - Do you want something? - I heard you talking, I thought you said Glenys. - That's me. - I thought you might be Glenys Mathieson, from Mulgrave. - No. - I'm sorry, I just thought you might be. - [Glenys] Mulgrave? [women laugh] - [Anne] Oh darling, you haven't touched your lunch. Try and eat something. I'll be back in an hour. [phone rings] Kate, get that will you? - Hello? Yep, this is Kate McLelland speaking. Oh... A photo? Yes, yes I'll send one. Oh, of you? That'd be fantastic. Our address is Apartment 12, 313 Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay. I'd love to come and see you one day. Do you think that'd be possible? Oh, I see. Will you send it today, then? Thank you, thank you very much, goodbye. [Kate laughs] - She's got pretty eyes. - I wish I could meet her. - Well, you know where she lives. - She said no, definitely. [classical piano music] Is Cavendish Road far from here? - Yeah, 15 minutes drive out of town. - Is there a bus that goes out there? - No bus. You can get the taxi. Doesn't start work til about nine, in fact. - [Taxi Driver] Been up here before? - No, I haven't. - Beautiful country. Real flat. Some people like it hilly, I like it flat. [gentle piano music] - Come on. Hey, wake up. Come on. [sorrowful violin music] - Who are you? - Kate McLelland. I...I've been waiting for you all day, I hope you don't mind. - What are you here for? - I know your mother. - Are you from the city? - Yes, I am. The train got in early this morning. - [May] Are you a relative? - Sort of. Of your mother's. - Mum will be home from work soon. I've gotta feed the chooks. Are you a cousin? - Uh, sort of second cousin. I'm not a very close relative. - I didn't know we had any more cousins. [playing sorrowful melody] - Why did you come here? I told you not to. - I had to come. - I've got a husband, he doesn't know you exist. You've gotta get out of here. [Kate cries softly] You shouldn't have come. Look, I'll take you down to my girlfriend's place, but you can't stay here. - Who is this? - Greg. We've gotta have a talk. - May? This is Kate. Why don't you take her down and show her the chooks. Don't tell May anything. She's my first daughter. I wanted to tell you, but I never could. I got involved with a man while I was at school. I was stupid. He was married. I was stupid. - Who was he? - One of my teachers. I've never seen him since, I don't know where he is or what he's doing, and I wouldn't care. - Did he know about the kid? - [Glenys] No. - Who else knows? - Only dad. He took me down to Sydney to have it doctored. - Glenys, why didn't you tell me? - Why do you think? I thought if I told you, you wouldn't want to marry me. Oh, for God's sake, Greg. I was only 17, it happened before I knew you. - You told me I was the first. - You were the first that ever meant anything. - I still had a right to know. - I had one affair before I was married, how many did you have? - That's different. You had a kid. - Teachers make a big impression on you at that age. He was nice. I wouldn't give him a second glance today. I was scared stiff, I didn't know what was happening. I was sick every morning before school. After the exams, dad took me down to Sydney, I stayed in a home for unmarried mothers for months, til it was over. - Why did you bring her here? - I didn't. She found me. - It's gonna make me look like a bloody fool if it gets out. - It happened before I knew you. - That's not gonna make any difference to the gossip mongers around here, is it? Why did she come? - She's going back to Sydney in the morning. - No, she can go tonight. - She came all this way by herself to talk to me, Greg. - So, so what'll we tell the kids? - Tell them she's a relative. - I'll just hope nobody finds out. - She'll be on the first train in the morning. - I'll collect the boys. Whoop, come on then. There you go. - [May] Is it good, living in the city? - It's noisier than here, and faster, but it's not as peaceful. - It gets boring here. - No, this is nice. - Why did you come? - To see you all. - [Greg] Come on, come on, come on... - God, brothers are awful. Do you have any brothers? - [Kate] Yeah, one, about the same age. [Kate laughs] - Greg said you could stay the night, but you have to go home in the morning. - Look, I'm really sorry if I caused you some trouble. - He'll get over it. He didn't know anything about it. - I'm really sorry. I didn't realize what might happen. - No, he'll be all right in a little while. Where did you get that wrist band? - My grandmother's a collector. She pinched it at the hospital. - I suppose you think I'm terrible for walking out on you? It wasn't easy, you know? I wanted to keep you, but they said I couldn't. My mum was dead, you see, and my dad couldn't have coped. - What about... - Oh, he didn't even know. [laughs] I was all set to go to Sydney and study music before I got pregnant. - [Kate] Really? - Yeah. But after you were adopted, I didn't want to go anymore. - Why? - Felt awful, cried all the time, hopeless. Didn't want to go out, didn't want to do a thing. My dad was really good to me. One night, he persuaded me to go to a country ball, that's where I met Greg. We got married straight away. Had May nine months later. I felt fine again after that. - Didn't you ever want to try and find me? - Hundreds of times. I used to dream about you, what you looked like, what they'd called you. What could I do? I couldn't say anything to Greg. Once I'd lied at the start, I had to keep on lying. I'm glad in a way, that it's all come out in the open. - So what happens now? - Greg's scared stiff someone's gonna find out. You've gotta go home in the morning. Well, there's no sense in stirring things up here. - I won't stir things up. - They'll have gossip round here. You got to go home. What did you tell May? - I said I was a cousin. - She knows all her cousins. - I'm much more than a cousin. - Look, I'd love you to get to know your sisters and brothers better, but you just can't. You've gotta go in the morning. [Kate sighs] [gentle piano and violin music] - [laughs] Very good! You're so good. You should go to the Conservatorium in Sydney. They've got a special high school there, for kids with your sort of talent. - That'd be fantastic. But we couldn't afford it, could we mum? - No, we couldn't. - Well you don't have to pay, it's a government school. - What a complete waste of time. - Oh, can I use the phone? I think I should ring my parents just to tell them I'm okay. - In Sydney? - Yeah, she'll be really worried. - Well, you see, we rang grandpa at Christmas. And it does cost an awful lot. - Oh, that's all right, Kate. Just make it a quick call, eh? - Sure. - [Bob] Mulgrave? - [Anne] Mulgrave? - [Bob] Mulgrave. - [Anne] When are you coming back? Tomorrow? Central? Four o'clock. Here's dad. - Hello? - [May] That's beautiful. - [Kate] What? This? - Yeah. It is a real Kimono? - Yeah, my dad brought it back from Tokyo. Have it. - Oh no, I couldn't. - Please? I've got another one. - Gosh, you're amazing. I look like a model. Where did you learn how to do it? - My school friends. They look at Vogue and experiment. And I watch my mother. - Could you teach me? - Sure. - I'd love to live in Sydney. - You could come for a holiday. Listen, there's this competition held every year in September, for young musicians. There's a section for violinists. I entered last year and it's really easy. - I wouldn't be good enough. - You are! We'd be playing in the competition together. - Where would I stay? - With me! - You're not really my cousin, are you? Did mum have you before she met dad? We're sisters. We'd be playing in the competition together. It's called the [mumbles] Competition for Young Musicians. - Boys! - And May could stay with-- - I'll take the boys to school. - Greg, you've got to take Kate to the station. - Yeah, I'll come back. - Peter's lunch. - May could stay with me and we could practice together, and I'm sure she would get into the Conservatorium High School. - We couldn't afford to live in Sydney. - It's practically free. And May could board with someone. - May, go and get ready for school, you're late. And take that muck off your face. Kate, I wanna have a talk to you, outside. I want you to stop filling May's head with crazy ideas about going to Sydney. - They're not crazy. She's a really good violinist. She could get into that competition and she could get into the the Conservatorium School. - Has it ever occurred to you that we mightn't want her to go? - Why not? - Because it'll give her big ideas. - She should be ambitious, she's good. - Who do you think you are, come out here, telling me what to do with my daughter? - She's my sister. And she knows she is. - You told her? - [Kate] I did not! She guessed! - [Glenys] See what you've done? She knows about me. - She doesn't think you've done anything wrong. She just thinks it's great to have a sister. - We don't want to send her away. She's our daughter and we love her. - If you really loved her, you'd let her do what she's best at. - We'll decide what's best for her, thanks very much. - Look, I know you weren't able to go on with your music, but it isn't fair to stop her. - You were the reason I never went on with anything! I'm sorry. - Now, don't forget to write to me. - I won't, and you send a photo. - Here, keep it. It's the only one I've got. He was a maths teacher. [train horn sounding] - Maths. My worst subject. - There she is! [voice announcing over intercom] - You decided to come back? - Darling, we've been so worried. [Anne and Kate crying] - [Kate] I'm sorry I put you through all this, I just had to find out. - Well... What was she like? - Mmm, very pretty, young and smart. And she used to play the piano really well. And she's got a foul temper. And she thinks I'm a spoiled brat. - Spoiled brat, eh? - I've got three half brothers, they're all pretty awful. They make you look like a saint. Oh, and then there's the husband, Greg. Best thing of all is my sister, May. She's two years younger than me, and she's really nice. She's a really talented violinist. My father... You wouldn't believe it. He was a maths teacher. - Well, you've got no excuse then, have you? - [Kate] [laughs] None. Mum? I'd love to invite May to stay. - With us? - Could you, mum? - Talk about it later. - It's awful to say it, but I didn't really like her very much. We sort of clashed. It's different with May, though. We're really close. Glenys tries to keep us apart. - She's probably afraid of losing her. Like she lost you. - Do you think I should persuade Glenys into letting May play in the competition? - I think you should let her decide for herself. [door buzzer sounds] It's the real estate man. Aww, I know. I hate selling it as much as you. - I had no idea things were going so badly for dad. - You were pretty wrapped up in your own problems. - I am a spoiled brat, aren't I? [door buzzer sounds] - You can be a bit self-centered. - Dad, do we really need this boat? - Has your mother been talking to you? - Well, it's just that we don't use it much. - Look, I'd sell my right arm and leg before I put this on the market. - Honestly dad, we don't use it much, do we? - It was your present, Kate. It's got your name on it. Just clean the boat. You always get your own way in the end. - Tell her that even if you entered now, you can't win a scholarship until you're 16, but if you don't start going into competitions now, then you won't get the experience. May, you're really good. Just ask her. Okay, bye bye. [birds chirping and squawking] Hello! Oh May, good! Where's your family? - They're just coming. - Wait here. But dad, you've got to meet them. - I don't want to. - Why? - Because it's too embarrassing. - Oh, come on Bob. They'll think we're terrible if we don't at least say hello. - [Bob] All right. - Hello Mrs. McLelland. - Anne. - Glenys. And this is my husband, Greg. - [Anne] Hello. - [Glenys] And my daughter, May. - [Anne] Hello May. - [Greg] How d'ye do? - [May] Hi. - This is my husband, Bob. - Hello, Bob. - How do you do? - And my mother, Mrs. Campbell. - Greg Mathieson. - Uh, Bob. - Nice to meet you. - And this is Robbie. - Oh May, that's us, we've gotta go. - Good luck, girls. - Bye. - Don't run, May. - Good luck. - She just goes running everywhere. - Thanks very much for having Kate to stay. I hope she wasn't too much trouble? - [Glenys] Oh, no trouble at all. [instruments tuning and warming up] - You nervous? - Terrified. - You'll be all right once you get started. - Oh, Kate, I thought I'd missed you. - Oh, hi. - I just wanted to wish you the best of luck. - Oh, thanks. Sarah, this is my sister, May. - Hi. - Nice to meet you, Sarah. - Good luck to you, too. Kate tells me you're terrific. I'd better go, I'll see you later. - Bye. [people murmuring and settling] [audience applauding] [playing classical music] [audience applauding] [classical flute and piano music] [classical piano music] [classical trumpet music] [classical bassoon and piano music] [classical piano music] [audience applauding] [classical violin and piano music] [audience applauding] - Before I announce the winners, may I just pass on the congratulations of the judges to all the contestants.

And so, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the grand prize is the violinist May Mathieson. [audience applauding] [Kate and May laughing] [classical piano music]
