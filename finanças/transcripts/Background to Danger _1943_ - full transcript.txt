"1942." "Today in all this war-torn world there remain only a few uneasy neutrals." "Of these countries, Turkey is the most important." "For with her may lie the identity of the ultimate victor." "Observe her position." "At her front door in Bulgaria are the German hordes." "At her back door in the Caucasus are the Russians." "At her side door in Syria are the British and the fighting French." "With only Turkish neutrality to keep them apart." "Turkey wants be neutral." "Yet intrigue is what she fears. Intrigue."

Has he arrived? He is in the anteroom, Herr Robinson. Good. Send him in immediately. - Yes, sir. Rudick, Sit down. We need a flight from Ankara to Berlin in fast time. Six hours. Our plane service is still efficient at any rate. How old are you, Rudick? Fifty-two. Fifty-two full years my dear friend. I trust the time has not yet come for you to retire. Retirement is not good. An active man retires and what happens? Heart failure. Apoplexy. Or something sudden strikes him down. Did I rush all the way to Berlin to hear you .. You came because I sent for you. My dear Rudick, is it possible that you do not understand? I understood and I acted. I threw the bomb at Von Papen myself. An explosion took place and Russians were arrested. Russians were arrested. Russians who proved they were miles away at the time. In all my experience there's never been such inept handling of a simple matter. Have you forgotten the Reichstag fire? There, my friend was a masterpiece. Of creating a political crisis. Had you followed our example. Our esteemed ambassador Herr Von Papen would be dead. And the farce of Turkish neutrality would be ended. But .. let me tell you. My dear Rudick. At times your limited mentality convinces me you belong exclusively .. To Mussolini. Our problem is a simple one. We must create an incident. Any kind of an incident. It will convince Turkey that Russia is about to attack her. How we accomplish this does not matter. Our task is to present Turkey with a match. That will inflame the people against Russia. Perhaps an uprising in Ankara? No, Rudick. In international diplomacy .. The shortest distance between two points is never a straight line. We must use the back door to Turkey. Somewhere on the road to Ankara we will make use of our friends. Friends who can be bought for the occasion. Istanbul Express. Mister, mister. Cigar, cigarette? Have you got any gum? No, no, no. Chewing gum. Chiclets. How much? - Cinq francs. French franc. French franc. - Forty cents for a package of gum? Not me, brother. Here is a franc and call it a deal. Hey. Here you are. Merci, Monsieur. Merci. A piece of gum? No thanks. - You sure you won't have some? Sorry. It's okay by me. This stuff is hard to find. To mean it is a strange custom, this. Chewing the gum. I could never learn to like it. You are an American, are you not? Uhuh. Oh, it is a wonderful thing to be an American. Free. Independent. "Four score and seven years ago." "Our fathers brought forth upon this continent." "A new nation." "Conceived in liberty." "And dedicated to the proposition .." "That all men." "Are created equal." I learned to speak English in an American missionary school. You do alright. You no doubt consider it strange to take my own food onboard this deluxe train. No. Not necessarily. On trains these days. They feed soldiers first and .. Civilians second. That is how it should be. So I generally bring my own. You travel a lot? I used to. We were always travelling before the war. A now everything is so changed. Yeah, and the world isn't like it used to be. I've been across Persia and south Russia in the last two months. I've seen a lot. I just flew in from Baku. The fog grounded us in Aleppo. May I hang up your coat? No thanks, I don't want to take it off. - Well. Let me get you a pillow. That man. That man out there. - What, he said something to you? He is following me. Why, if he sticks his head in here again I'll punch him on the nose. Here. Make yourself comfortable. Allow me to introduce myself. My name Ana Remzi. Joe Barton. You know, I've been wondering about you. This man out there is an informer. He recognised me. At the frontier I shall be searched. In here I have .. More than five thousand lira of securities. It is all that remains of .. What my poor father left me. I no longer have a home. They killed my father and my two brothers, the swine. Please take my securities across the border for me. You are an American. They would not dare search your person. I will pay you 200 lira. Almost 150 dollars. And there is no risk for you. This means a lot to you, doesn't it. Oh yes, Mr Barton. You will never regret it. Okay. I'll do it. But for free. No charge. Turkey - Syria frontier. Turkey - Syria frontier. Really, there is no need for you to search me. I have told you everything. My name is .. Yes Madam, we know. This is merely a regulation. Very well. Come with me to the customs office. What is your business? I sell machinery for oil wells and refineries. I've got some money waiting for me at Ankara. At Ankara? Where are you going to reside, sir? At the Hotel Europe. If you remain in the country more than one week .. Please, visit a police station and register. Miss Remzi. I was getting worried about you. Well, I guess that's that. It's all clear. Here you are. - Please put it back in your pocket. This man got back on the train again. Wouldn't you do me just one more favor? Sure. Please take my securities on as far as Ankara. Why not. You are so kind. All you Americans are so wonderful. Now listen, this is what you do. You go to your hotel. And you .. What do you call it? You kill a little time while I get rid of this man. Let me take you to the hotel. No. It is much easier for me to get rid of him if I am alone. And then, after about an hour or so. You come to my hotel. The Hotel Kara Deniz. And I will be there waiting for you. That's swell. Maybe we can have dinner together. How do you do. The hotel is full up. You have a reservation? Yes. Barton. Yes, sir, I received it myself. You are in 315. Hello? Who? Just a minute. It's for you, sir. - Me? Yes, sir. Hello. Mr Barton? Everything is alright. I'll be right over. Say, could you tell me where the Kara Deniz hotel is? It's in the old section of town. It is not very respectable there. I get it. Hey. Miss Remzi is expecting me. Name? - Barton. Room 25. Miss Remzi? Miss Remzi. Miss Remzi. Mr Barton. Mr Barton. - What's the matter? Mr Barton, please .. Nikolai. Where did that man go? Up the street. Wait for me at the automobile. Hotel Europe. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? Mr Barton? - Yes. Open up. Police. Just a minute. Open up! Open up. Your passport, Mr Barton. What's the trouble? I just arrived in town. Your passport, Mr Barton. American, huh? - That's right. I have a few questions to ask. I suggest you cooperate. I'd be delighted. Salesmen, huh? Uhuh. What brings you to Turkey? Just passing through on my way back to the States. Where did you go after you left the hotel? No place. My first time here, and I just went out and took a little stroll. You will submit to a search of your person? Sure. Here, I'll help you. The company I work for and my wallet. There is some chewing gum in there. And a few telephone numbers. They won't do you any good. They're from Brooklyn. [ Turkish language ] You will please come with us. Where? To the police commissary. He would like to ask you a few more questions. It looks like you're taking the long way around getting to the police station. Keep quiet please. Is this what you call "Headquarters"? Keep moving. Understand? That is one language I do understand. [ German language ] Ah, the American. Be seated. Fotograf? [ German language ] You are indignant no doubt, Mr Barton. Outraged even. That is quite understandable, sir. What right have I, a stranger, to have my men kidnap you, an American citizen? Here on legitimate business unless these documents lie. The answer is: no right at all. Except my own wishes. That is right, sir. Make yourself comfortable. I am always in favour of doing business in comfort. Business? I've got no business with you. Come come, Mr Barton. Let's get to the point. Why did you kill Miss Beronowitz? Who? Beronowitz. Never heard of her. Perhaps you knew her under the name of Remzi. Ana Remzi. I don't know what you are talking about. You may think that I enquire after the fate of .. Of Beronowitz or Remzi as you know her out of some petty desire for revenge. But that is not so. Miss Remzi personally was not of the slightest interest to me. She was however carrying a certain item of mine. You probably examined it. You will know then that the photographs are of no monetary value to you. Don't waste any time. Let me handle him. Who are you anyway? I fail to see that it can be of the slightest interest to you to know it. It is however, Robinson. Colonel Robinson. Now that we have observed that formality, let us get to the point. Remzi telephoned me to say that you were carrying the envelope. My men were on the spot in time to see you go in her hotel. They did not see you leave. Is that correct, Mailler? That is correct. I'm telling you for the last time I don't know what you are talking about. Don't you think you are being rather foolish? For instance? Now, please. It will only spoil this delightful evening to talk of unpleasant things. Be sensible Mr Barton and hand over the envelope. Forget the whole affair. We might even discuss the question of a substantial honorarium .. In recognition of your trouble and discomfort. What do you say? I've said my piece and I'll stick to it. The art of persuasion has always interested me. The early 1920s brought with them a renaissance of that art .. Which compares in glory and achievement to the inquisition itself. Our modern masters work with a sublime simplicity and humility. And are truly inspired. Then there is the procedure which consists of treating .. The lower part of the face with rubber truncheons. Oddly enough, the subject frequently dies of lung trouble a few months later. Something to do with congestion. Caused by the treatment. There are many others just as interesting. All have their advocates. Myself, I have no special likes or dislikes. You will I think, see what is in my mind. Do you, Mr Barton? The good old third degree. Very pretty reasoning, Mr Barton. I'm in no mood for drawing-room pleasantries. It seems we shall have to insist on your cooperation. You will never get it. - I think so. I shall leave him to you, Mailler. Only don't be too long about it. [ German language ] They are taking you downstairs to the cellars. You will be separated from this room by several metres of stonework and earth. But I think I will be able to hear your reactions. To Captain Mailler's persuasive methods. Yeah? That's what you think. Are you going to be sensible, my friend? Or do I have to make a real start on you? Had enough yet? You're just wasting your time. Drop your hands! Stay back there. A very charming little gadget. Keep your hands up. You pigs. That's the only language you understand. - Wait a minute. This is my meat. No, no. This way. Follow me. This is my sister, Mr Barton. I think we've met before. How did you know my name? - I'll explain to you later. Never mind who I am. Kindly listen attentively. You will find a dead woman in the Kara Deniz hotel. The last person to see her alive was an American named Barton. Registered at the Hotel Europa. Check with the night porter. Well, here we are. Please. Please make yourself at home and comfortable. Sit down. And we will look after your wounds. My sweet little Tamara, how about getting some hot water? I'll be glad to. Does that pain you? It's nothing much. I would forget it. Forget it? No. Very bad things can come from very little cuts. It's nice to relax after what we have been through. And we have been through quite a bit haven't we. We sure have. Well, now we are here, now we eat. But first, we will have a drink of vodka. That will, how you say "pick you up". Come on, stop stalling. You said when we get to the apartment we'd talk. Alright. Let's talk. Yes. But not so quick. Oh, you Americans. Always in a hurry hurry. Business, business. Business. Then we will talk but quietly. First, like gentlemen. We will have a drink of vodka. Not for me. I never use it. Strange. It's just a scratch. I wouldn't bother. I want to do it. Again you put that cheap vodka in my bottle. Where did you hide the real one? - In the kitchen. She always hides my good vodka from me. Excuse me please. I don't know they always keep my vodka from me. Barton lives at the Europa hotel, room 315. Search it. I will keep him here to give you time. Room 315, Europa Hotel? This is vodka. Smell it. Couldn't I tempt you? It would make you feel much better. I feel okay, thanks to your sister. Well. Well, let's get down to business. What is your racket? - My racket? What is "racket"? An American word? I don't understand it. Well, to you, my very suspicious friend. See. Why are you so suspicious of me? Didn't I save your life? Yes. Sure. And I appreciate it too. But there are a few things I'd like to have cleared up. Who are you? Who was Ana Remzi? And why was she killed? Four simple questions. And I'd like to have four simple answers. Four simple .. What am I going to do with him? Answer his questions. Thanks. Your sister has a lot of sense. Oh yes, she does. You stay out of this. I can see we are not getting anyplace. I'm going back to the hotel. Please, Mr Barton. - You see, Nikolai. You are so crude. I am crude, I am not subtle. I know. I don't know what to do. Perhaps we try the American way? Cards on the table, huh? Now we are getting someplace. What is your business? Confidentially. I am an agent of Soviet Union. What is your business, sir? Machinery. I sell it. Oh, machinery. You know with us Russians, machinery is .. well .. It is like a religion. What kind of machinery please? Heavy stuff for refineries. I've been in Syria the last few months. - Oh, Syria? Then you came to Ankara from Aleppo, didn't you? Right. And in between you met Ana Remzi. And she gave you a certain envelope. Right again. And when you tried to return it, she was dead. Huh? Correct. - Then what happened? Then you showed up. What is Colonel Robinson's interest in all this? Pig! He is a Nazi agent. May I ask you a question, Mr Barton? - Sure. Why on earth didn't you give up that envelope and .. Save yourself that painful interlude in Colonel Robinson's cellar? I had an idea it was important to the Russian government. That's right, it is. May I ask you another question? Why does the welfare of the Russian government concern you so much? I'm an American. America is at war. Russia is one of our allies. Of course, Mr Barton. I apologise, I apologise. I know these few simple words remove all suspicion from my mind concerning you. I wish I could say the same for you. Well, I'll tell you everything now. Everything, believe me. Okay. I'm waiting. You know that the Nazis are trying to cause trouble between Russia and Turkey. Yes, I read the papers. You might also know that they won't stop at anything. Bribery, forgery, murder. They've even made photographic copies of false Russian plans to invade Turkey. They are trying to publish that in the Turkish press. Trying to excite the Turkish people. So that they stop being neutral and go over to the side of Germany. Well. They didn't count with the Russian counter-espionage. The Russian agent Miss Beronowitz, or as you know here Miss Remzi. Intercepted those forgeries. Well .. With consequences to herself that you know. May I ask you now in the name of the Soviet Union .. To turn that envelope over to me? Let me get this straight. That girl I met on the train, Miss Remzi. She was a Russian agent and he was working for you? That's right. That's correct. I like my cards on the table, not from a cold deck. You and Colonel Robinson should get together on your stories. He told me Remzi was working for him. Maybe he was lying. Maybe you are lying. Well, I think I will go to the hotel. Thanks for the first aid. Wait, Mr Barton. I want the envelope. You or nobody else is going to get it until I find out what it is all about. No? - No. Sorry. I had to do that. You did me a good turn but .. Don't ever pull a gun on me. Yes, Nikolai. Why don't you stop treating Mr Barton as if he were an imbecile. It stands to reason if he won't give the envelope to Robinson under pressure .. He wouldn't give it up to us. If you and your brother are on the level about being Russian agents. Meet me at the Russian Embassy is two hours. The envelope? I'll have it with me. I want some vodka. I want some vodka! How do you do, Mr Barton. - Morning. Any messages for me? - No, nothing sir. Thanks. Oh, he is wanted for murder? Mr Barton just went into his room. He is in 315. That is Mr Barton. This way. Down to the basement. Yes, sir? Have you any Polo cigarettes? Polo? Did you say "Polo"? - Yes. P-O-L-O. A friend in America told me about this place. In America? So, Tuncay & Sons are known even in America. Did you hear that, Papa? I am sorry. We have so many brands of cigarettes, I .. I can't quite place the name "Polo". Perhaps if you would be kind enough to write it out for me. Sure. Papa. Do we have this cigarette? [ Turkish language ] This is my father. He knows all about cigarettes and blends. As a matter of fact there is nothing about tobacco he doesn't know. Eh, papa? Effendi. This cigarette of which you speak. It is very strong. The blend .. - I know the blend. Three parts Basma. Three parts Latakia. Three parts Mahala. How many does the Effendi desire? 200 would be plenty. Would you like your initials on each cigarette? Yes. The initials are J.B. Mr McNamara will be very happy to see you, Mr Barton. Through that door and up the stairs. Hello, Mack. Hello, Barton. I thought you'd check in before this. Have any luck? - Yeah. I had some luck, but all bad. I had everything tied up in a nice sweet package and then things blew up. I need some help. Help? You're going to need plenty. There isn't a newspaper in Turkey this morning that doesn't carry your name. And every policeman in Ankara is on the lookout for you. I know. They almost nabbed me in my hotel. How do they connect me with the Remzi killing? According to the night porter at the hotel an American, Barton. Was the last person to see Ana Remzi alive. The American entered by the lobby but the clerk swore he didn't see him leave. What is the set up in Ankara? Can you get the heat off? No. The only we could handle that would be through the American Embassy. And as you know, that's impossible. They can't acknowledge you. If they do your usefulness as an agent is at an end. You are on your own. - Okay. There's a couple of people I want to check up on. Do you know anything about a Colonel Robinson? Fat. Slightly bald. Grey moustache. I don't have to look in my files for him. He is a political saboteur. His speciality is moulding public opinion. Shrewd. He has no more principles than a rattlesnake. 100 percent Nazi. I know. I've met him. He and his mob gave me a good going over. Why did they let you go? I don't get it, Barton. When that baby grabs you, you are out. Zero. Right away. I'm special. He had to let me live. What do you mean? He wanted the envelope. If I was a dead man he couldn't get it, could he. You got the envelope? - I had it. Remzi gave it to me on the train. Gave it to you? Why didn't you destroy it? Why did you wait? Mack. Do you know what was in that envelope? A set of plans. The Russian General Staff's blueprint for the invasion of Turkey. That's right. But they were phonies. I know they were phonies. But they can do the trick for Berlin. In the wrong hands those plans could be whipped-up meat. They could be used to stir the whole Turkish population .. Into a beautiful uproar against Russia. Who's going to do all this? You know how they do it. They've done it before. In Norway, the head Quisling. In France, Laval. And in Turkey? I see. I get it. Berlin always could cook up a new set of plans couldn't they? The plans are just the bait to lead you to him. Right on the nose, Mack. But I lost the bait. Who do you think got it, Robinson? I don't know. I am not sure. That's why I am here. To ask some questions and .. Look at a few pictures. Shoot. You got anything in your files on Zaleshoff? He says he is a Russian. He works with a girl. Supposed to be his sister. She is not bad looking. - Zaleshoff? A little guy? - Uhuh. They haven't been here long. I haven't been able to find out much about them. They may be Russian agents. Again, they may be not. And there was a man on the train that was following Miss Remzi. He was tall, about 6 foot 2 or 3. Had eyes Laval and a heavy black moustache. Could be a Romanian. Well, let's see. We try to keep tabs on all foreigners in Ankara as every other one is an agent. It's a tough job. Why, Syria was bush-league stuff compared to this town. All we had to worry about there were the Germans and the Vichy French. This one? - No. What about this one? - No, that's not him. I got a hunch. - Wait a minute. This is the guy. Igor Rashenko. That seems to be one of his names. Quite a traveller, this bird. A few trips to Romania, some jumps to Berlin and a few weekends in Italy. He seems to like the Axis countries. This is the monkey that followed Miss Remzi on the train. I think he killed her. If I can catch up with him I think I can get what I am after. Well, the last address we had on him was .. 120 Yelda Street. 120 Yelda Street? Why, that's where the Zaleshoff house is. Things are beginning to add up. Mack. You got a local man I can trust? Yeah. Why? I need somebody that can talk Turkish. They'll pick up a lot of Americans in the next days. I don't want to be one. I'll give you Hassan, the kid out of the store. He knows his way around Ankara like nobody. Don't let his looks fool you. He's as tough as they come. Yes, Mr McNamara? Go with Mr Barton. Do what he tells you. - Yes, sir. I would look very conspicuous without a hat and coat. Can you fix me up? In a jiffy. Let me see, a size 38 coat. A size 7 hat. Right? Make the hat 7 and one eighth. Where are you headed for now? A wild ride on a Turkish merry-go-round. What happened, Mr Barton? Where do you think you are going? Well, we were just leaving to meet you at the embassy. Go on. Get back in that apartment. Go on. But I swear to you Mr Barton we were just leaving for the Embassy. We had an appointment. It was your suggestion, wasn't it? I change my plans. Do you mind? Oh, no. The envelope. Did you bring it with you? - Sit down, the both of you. And don't get tricky. There's few things I want cleared up and I want them cleared up fast. What you want to know? The truth about the papers Remzi was carrying. I don't believe that cock-eyed story about them being forgeries. But I swear to you they are. For your information the Turkish police have tagged me with the murder of Remzi. No? Who killed her? It was one of our agents. Remzi was in the pay of the Nazis. Come on. The both of you stop this double talk. I'll take that. - Alright, alright. Stand up. How can you explain this? A German passport. I thought you told me you worked for the Soviet government. But we are. Since when did the Soviet Union adopt a Swastika? I have to admit it is a German passport but I have passports of many a country. They might send me to Berlin tomorrow. Have to be prepared for that emergency. I swear. I swear on the head of my mother, on the life of their children. I said the truth. But I don't .. Can I have some vodka? Skip the vodka. Open up that bag. - Alright. I give you my word of honor. Everything my brother has told you is a fact. We are Russian agents. You must believe us. Maybe you are but I would .. Mr Barton, I waited outside for you just as you told me. As soon as I saw the people come out .. - Where did they go? In a car. I could not follow them. I have their license number. - That's a great help. Maybe I can find out something. Hello, hello? [ Turkish language ] Just a second. What was all that talk? - I found out about the car. Yeah? It is registered to Igor Rashenko. Istanbul. 55 Bosphorus Road. Rashenko's car? Come on, let's go. You get the tickets? - Yes, sir. The train is very crowded. Any police? - Many. How far back of our car? - Just a few steps. Give me few words in Turkish. How do you say "yes"? Evet. - Evet. Alright? Alright. - Tamam. Okay. You keep talking as we walk along. This is the Istanbul paper. It carries the same description of you as the others. It does, huh? Do you think they recognise me? It's only a description in the paper. Where has he gone? The conductor. You start an argument. I'm getting out of here. I am terribly sorry Monsieur. I've been robbed! My wallet has been stolen. What is the matter here? Colonel Robinson. Ah, Herr Bastaki. Hello Robinson. Let's step into the library. - A pleasure. Please sit down. Well, Herr Bastaki. There they are. A complete and detailed plan by the Soviet General Staff .. For the invasion of Turkey. They are authentic? - Authentic or not. Let the Turkish people see them spread across the face of the Turkish papers. With all the details authenticated and explained. And then .. And then? In Poland we had the corridor. In Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland. And last year in Romania we had friends. In this country, we have neither. Neither acclaim. Nor enough friends. We must even create our own incident. This will be it. And Germany enters Turkey? I see. Yes. To protect it. Berlin, Stamboul, Baghdad. Bismarck's old dream almost a hundred years old. Realized at last. You have the press, the newspapers. It is going to appear on every street corner in Turkey in 24 hours. I have the ear and the authority of the Wilhelmstrasse. Well? You owned oil-wells in your native Romania once. They shall be returned to you. When? When your country no longer needs them to conduct a war with? Which time will be shortened appreciably. By the publication of this information in your paper. Pending that, Germany will be the protector of your adopted country. There will be certain privileges and positions. Within the gift of Wilhelmstrasse .. Which will be as valuable as oil wells. Then. I will request this promise from the Wilhelmstrasse. That was anticipated. An aeroplane is being held at your disposal. Alright. Then. I will telephone you here tonight. Make yourself comfortable here. You will excuse me please. Herr Bastaki. We have been called a methodical people for reason. What's that? A memorandum of the transaction between us described in detail. I will ask you to sign it. In detail? You are asking me to sign my own death warrant in Turkey in case .. You should fail or I should .. Should change your mind. Exactly Herr Bastaki. Please. I will .. telephone it here tonight. I am sure you will, Herr Bastaki. Mr Barton. - Keep your voice down. Where is your brother and Rashenko? They're not here. - When will they be back? I don't know. How many cups of coffee can you drink at once? Tamara, is the coffee ready? Rashenko and I are leaving in a few minutes and we .. Nice to see you boys together. You sure have a deplorable lack of faith in your fellow men don't you, Mr Barton. We are very happy to see you, especially Tamara. She has been worried about you. I can imagine. I was afraid Rashenko might have hit you too hard. You seem to have lots of duties. Like tearing hotel rooms apart. Mine for instance. I'll not get slugged from behind this time. Especially by you. Get over there all of you and sit down. Don't you think Mr Barton we are losing very precious time? What exactly are your intentions? - My intentions haven't changed. I'm going to get what I'm after. The envelope. Where is it? - I haven't got it. We sent Rashenko to search your hotel room. But somebody got there before us. We are convinced it is Colonel Robinson. That's why we came to Istanbul, to find it. Look, if I told you that I had you put out of action for your own sake .. You would be surprised, wouldn't you? Well, it is true. In your present state as a criminal .. You would be nothing but a liability to us. Don't you realize? You are a marked man. You are wanted for murder. You use every trick, don't you. But it is logical that we two should work together. You want the envelope. I want it, so .. So we are allies again. Is that it? Yes. Certainly. And we are going to work together, side by side. Well, that is what I hope. - Alright, then hand it over. But I haven't got it. Look, my sister told you we came to Istanbul .. Because we are convinced that Colonel Robinson has it. Take it easy. I still don't believe you. Well, I don't know what to do with him. Please, Nikolai. Perhaps I can convince him. Now, if I will write down how I killed the traitor Beronowitz. And sign my name. Would that convince you? Thank you, Rashenko. Well. If you permit us we can do it right away. "I, Igor Rashenko hereby confess to the murder of Ana Beronowitz." "Alias Ana Remzi." You mean to tell me he's writing his life away just like that? Why not? Nikolai or I would do the same. Now Mr Barton I hope you are convinced. Yeah. I'm convinced that you haven't got what I am looking for. And that's all I'm interested in. Well. Mr Barton. As you are an American I can see you have the situation well in hand. Yeah, come on. Let's get out of here. We've got to find Robinson. - There is a caf?. The Golden Horn. The Nazis make it their hangout in Istanbul. You got any friends there? - Yes. Good. What is your desire. Two raki. Hello? Is Colonel Robinson there? Just a minute. Herr Hotchkins. Hotchkins I've been waiting to hear from you. The American. Did you follow him from Ankara? Excellent, Hotchkins. Excellent. Make sure he does not leave the Golden Horn. If you must resort to extreme violence, do so. The important thing I stress is I wish to be rid of this meddler for all time. Once you have acted, let me know the results. I found out that Mr Robinson has been in the German Consulate many times today. Thanks. That is our next stop. Looks like there is going to be trouble. Come on, Hassan. [ German language ] You understand English? - Yah. Where is Robinson? - I don't know. Don't lie. Where did he go? - I tell you I don't know. We know he was at the German Consulate today. You had better tell us. Don't argue with him. Step on it. When you get up to 80, I'll bounce him out. Wait! Wait, I'll tell you. He is at the villa of Bastaki. You'll take us there or I'll bat your brains out. I will. Continue on this road. Is this it? - Yeah. Just up the road. - Turn off your lights. I'm going up to check on this monkey to see if he is lying. You stay here and hold on to this guy. Okay. [ German language ] [ German language ] [ Radio ] "We will now turn you over to our studio orchestra." "Whose first number will be by Johann Strauss." Rashenko. Drop your gun, Mr Barton. Put your hands up. I'm glad you had the intelligence to obey my command. My reputation for accurate shooting has been challenged but twice. And on both occasions it proved disastrous to the challenger. Knowing how you Nazis operate they probably had their backs turned. Perhaps. If it was to accomplish our purpose. Is it alright if I put my hands down? Please kick that weapon in this direction first. It must be obvious to you that your arrival here was not unexpected. Apparently there's no way to persuade you to mind your own business. You still talk as much as ever. Yes, Mr Barton. I still talk. I still act also. That fact has probably not escaped you. Please sit down. As you know I am a firm advocate .. Of comfort at all times. I wouldn't advise you to attempt any heroics. Just looking for a cigarette. Allow me. I am happy to see that you still believe in putting yourself at ease, Mr Barton. A curious touch of the grotesque. Dead man on the floor. A condemned one sitting before me. And a Strauss waltz as the funeral march. What could be more entertaining? - What are you driving at? I regret that we must soon part company again, Mr Barton. To depart is to die a little the French say. And I am afraid it is you who are going to die. Most of us kick of sooner or later. Maybe it's my tough luck to be sooner. Very sound reasoning, Mr Barton. I am not entirely satisfied to see you die. You have a strong face, a determined jaw and a clear eye. You also possess a quality, which as a businessman I value highly. Extreme tenacity. An admirable persistency. You find it very rare. I could use your services, sir. Translating all that chatter into plain English: what do you want from me? I give the chance to participate in one of the greatest adventures of our time. The creation of a new world order. How do I fit into that? From time to time you will be given assignments .. Which will require the attention of a courageous and determined man. I don't demand any services for nothing, You will be paid well. I'm listening. Good. Please don't imagine that by seeming to agree to my suggestion .. You can interfere any further in this present affair. Liberty will not be restored to you for several weeks. You mean, until Turkey and Russia are at war? And a pro-Nazi government controls this country? Precisely. Until matters have been sorted out in Turkey to our satisfaction. Is that all? - Not quite. You see, you might also be thinking. That if agree now you may save your skin and be able to retract later. That will not do. I shall require proof of your intentions. Such as? It will be of interest you to know that we have some of your companions here. Mailler. You see now, Mr Barton? Well, you didn't want to listen to me. - Be quiet. A charming reunion, no doubt. Perhaps you're a trifle distressed at meeting your friends here? They are no friends of mine. Sit down please. What has this got to do with us? The Russians have a habit of continuing to fight until they are exterminated. Death is the only answer. In an uncertain world nothing is more certain than that. Supposing therefore we were to ask you to shoot Mr Zaleshoff for us? Ha. Quite a predicament. It's a deal. Between the eyes is a good place, Mr Barton. It is quick and sure. [ Click ] What kind of a gag is this? Come Mr Barton, you don't think we would put a loaded automatic in your hand .. Without knowing the sincerity of your intentions. Well, you know it now. Herr Robinson. Berlin on the telephone. You will excuse me, I know. Mailler will see to your comforts. Colonel Robinson on telephone. [ German language ] [ German language ] Then I leave immediately. Have a car ready. Yah, Herr Robinson. Good news, Mailler. Very good news. Bastaki regains his Romanian oilfields. And the Third Reich converts another passive neutral into an active ally. Congratulations. What about our little deal? I'm afraid our farce must be concluded here and now. The truth of the matter is you're merely providing me with an amusing interlude. Where we differ sir, is while you and your Russian friends failed your tasks. I have accomplished mine. Maybe. But the final score isn't in yet. I am afraid it is. Mr Barton, perhaps there lurks in your mind the possibility of outside help? Could be. Would it disturb you to know that your young Turkish friend .. Has been put out of the way as you are going to be? I will not be stopped by you or anyone. I don't intend to fail. We Nazis do not relish failure. If you flop in your country you end up in a coffin. And rightly so. I would not like to go back to Berlin after a failure. I have taken precautions. What is about to happen to you is one of them. Another. Is this little document. What's that? That is a sword. The sword of Damocles. I made Bastaki sign it. Bastaki? Ah. That's your man. Who has been very useful to us. Who will continue to be useful to us so long as I hold this over his head. I even guarded against the possibility that Bastaki would change his mind. By this time tomorrow. I will have accomplished what even Bismarck could not. But you will not be here to see it, Mr Barton. Mailler. I leave these charming people in your capable hands. Dispose of them as you wish. Fortunately for us, we do not have to worry about interference this time. Bastaki will not return until tomorrow. Get up. Go on. Go on. All of you. How did you know the gun wasn't loaded? - By its weight. There might have been one bullet in it. - That's a chance I had to take. You had to take? How about me? Don't worry about that now. Our friend here has other ideas. Nikolai! We got to catch up with that fat guy. - Our car is down the road. Look out. [ German language ] You stay here. I'm going round the back. - Be careful. Don't worry about me. I'll take care of myself. The editor's office. Which one? - Straight ahead. Who is it you wish to see? - Mr Rader. He is very busy. - Colonel Robinson is here isn't he? Yes. - It is important I see him. He is in the composing room with Mr Rader. And does not wish to be disturbed. Thanks. It is a rough copy Herr Robinson but that is what it will look like. "Russia plans to attack Turkey." "Secret document reveals evidence." - Excellent, excellent. That should convince the Turkish people of Russia's intended treachery. The untiring efforts of our reporters led us to uncover this startling fact. That will save the armies of the Third Reich the trouble of invading Turkey. Moustaffa. When do you return to Berlin? - Tonight. There are other countries that still persist in remaining neutral. A toast to the new ally of the 3rd Reich .. The Turkish Republic, would not be out of place. By all means. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. For four years Rader, the Wilhelmstrasse has been attempting unsuccessfully .. To create an incident that would force Turkey and Russia .. At each other's throats. Threats, bribery, assassinations have been attempted with no success. But I, with a simple but brazen strategy .. Have in one week accomplished what they failed to do since the start of the war. [ Buzzer ] [ German language ] Something has gone wrong? - I don't know. They want me in the composing room immediately. I will be right back. Come here. Rader? Rader. Get back in there. Put up your hands. I'm sorry I haven't got any Strauss music to go with this. To me sir, there are occasions when music is out of place. As you are aware, I enjoy discussing business in comfort. Do you mind if I sit down? Stay on your feet. I'm calling the tune this time. At least you might allow me to lower my hands. Go ahead. The trouble with you Mr Barton is that .. You are a member of a rapidly disappearing ruling race. Your sense of danger is deficient. Your conceit monumental. 0r is it I wonder that you lack imagination? Get off the soapbox and hand over that envelope. I haven't got it. It will be a cinch for me to take it off your dead body. Give me it! I hope your nerves are good .. Because if your hand jerks one fraction of an inch I'm going to blast. Alright. Take them out and let me see them. Get over to the desk. Put them in that ashtray. And now burn them. I just want to be sure they don't get in the wrong hands again. You should be cognisant of the fact .. That this newspaper is in complete sympathy with the German government. It is for this reason .. That I give you my personal guarantee you will not leave this building alive. Unfortunately, Mr Barton. Those papers that are burning are no longer of any value. I have accomplished what I set out to do. Even as we talk, the paper is going to press. That's what you think. Now give me the other paper. - What paper? The Bastaki deal. I no longer have it. - That is your story. What are you going to do with it? The Turkish government will be glad to see the kind of Nazi deal Bastaki makes. What are you going to do with me? Nothing. There is such a thing as international law. I'm going to turn you over to the Turkish government. They will send me back to Berlin. [ German language ] Your passport, sir. Yes, you are quite right of course. I will not need that anymore. It is futile, Herr Robinson. Who were they talking about? They say that Himmler himself sent them. - Himmler? The hangman. Well Joe, you did a good job. I'll send a full report to the boys in Washington. Thanks. There is your plane. You'd better say goodbye to Miss Zaleshoff. Goodbye, huh? - C'est la guerre. No time for romance when duty calls. Come on, honey. Let's go. Hey, what is this? I've been assigned to Cairo too. So what do you think you two are going to do in Cairo? What do you think, Mack? C'est le guerre. We are going to cement Russian - American relations. (R0_s)
