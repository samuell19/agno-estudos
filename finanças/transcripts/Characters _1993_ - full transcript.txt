All the things in the world I can't believe I'm downtown with this geeky brother. - Man, you are so self-centered. You can do all the bickering in the world but the facts still remain. We have a report due analyzing and the paper's due too soon. Now, your only job is to pick out the interesting people. I'll record our observations on my pocket recorder. We'll call our report Characters. - No shit, Sherlock. - So keep searching. - Okay, since I don't know anyone in this town, let's clown. - What? - Let's make it interesting. Why don't we do a paper where we take a secret look at people and their actions. We can make our own analysis from the people we observe. - Hey, wait, wait. Kendal, I love it, man. I mean, I've always wanted to do something like that. - You're on, baby! (Kendal chuckles) - Good afternoon, especially to any students and staff. You are about to enter a world where you can take a shot at dreams and yet still be shocked right back into reality. (slow music plays) - Man, it's almost show time. I gotta make me enough money to see Eddie Murphy next week. Hey people, what's up? Don't miss out, I'm Happnens! How y'all doing today? I'm out here trying to make me a couple dollars so I can, you already know, see Eddie Murphy next week. You know, they got a show coming up down at the Paramount. Now, I used to mess around with a whole bunch of fat women. You know what I'm saying? I'm pulling back the layers and shit and Snickers is falling out and Skittles everywhere. (crowd chuckles) So, we got a 100 black men and one white man. - Hey, wait. - [Performer] What do you call the white man? - Let me check this out. - [Performer] Warden, okay. - He's pretty funny. - [Performer] We got 10 black men-- - Hey, yes, he's hella funny. - [Performer] What do you call the black, the white man? Coach. - How about you always saying look at-- - [Performer] Man, it's always problem. You know what I'm saying? I had another fat chick, right-- - [Woman] Robert, I'm with you, but please don't blow this opportunity. - Baby fried up a whole mound of fried chicken. I got up to the house and, you know, I'm trying to be delicate because Happening got a little bit of manners. You know, my Mama taught me how to eat over at somebody house. I'll pick up a piece of chicken and put it on my plate and a little Top Ramen and shit. (crowd laughs) Man, I finish my little piece of chicken. All I seen was a mound of chicken bones on the stove. You know what I'm saying? (crowd laughs) Let me tell ya', baby got grease everywhere. You know what I'm feeling? I only got one little wing. She got 83 whole chickens, I'm like, "Oh." Knowing I can't eat here, you know, I'll be done starved to death. Shit! Hey, man. I'm Happnens. I appreciate all your support. Come see me again-- - He sounded pretty good. - Because, I'm usually down here. - You know, I see some opportunity in this. - I appreciate it, I thank you very much. Thank you. Hey, put my coins down! All right, thank you. I appreciate that. - Yo'. - Yo', Happening dude, you hella funny man. - Right on, man, I appreciate that. - Man, my name's Robbie Simms. I promote Tommy Ho. - Oh, right on! - Hey, here's my card. - [Happening] Oh man! Right on! Where's the spot? - Hey, Vintage Inn. Eight p.m. sharp. - [Happening] I know where that's at. That's a pretty hip club. - Yeah, it is. - [Happening] I'll be there. You ain't got nothing to worry about. - Yeah, tonight. I know for a fact you ready, so I'm gonna see you there. Eight p.m.. - [Happening] Man, don't even trip, I'll be there. Eight o'clock at the big V.I.. - Yeah, that's right. You make sure, you know, you clean up your act a little bit. You know, straighten up the coat and everything else. You know? - Don't every body that. I got some tissues I got from lunch! Right through this lobby right here, cut through there. There's a little bathroom and shit. - [Robbie] Yeah! - I'll go and I'll do that and wash up and be clean. I'll be clean! This is my chance. - You got me sweating like a nigga going to the election in Georgia! (crowd laughs) He choose the fucking guy to yank on the stick. - No! - And pull a dirty stick right, y'all, out of the crack of his ass! I ain't got nothing else to say to my homeboy. Don't ever sweat me on the motherfucking tip no more, nigga. You know what I'm saying? Because, I walk on water, I eat bullets and I shit ice cream, homeboy! Are you understanding? And fuck this shit, but I'm going to be just as righteous because it ain't gonna be no big deal. - Pam, so what sort of act do you do? - I have a, it's a pretty adult, comedy act. - Okay, well, we'll talk in the future about you doing something on the show. - Oh great, that would be fine. - Okay, I'll talk to you later on. - Okay. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you too. - [Club Man] Okay. - You don't, you look-- - Todd, how are you doing? I'm glad you could make it. - Real good. - Are you enjoying the show? Oh, I'm fine. Are you enjoying the show or what? Oh great, great, great. - I ain't playing. - Boy, you better stop worrying! We're already in here. It only takes 10 minutes from-- - I felt-- - Maybe six and a half, but maybe happening? - Look, I put my business on the line, my name on the line, my body on the line for this dork! - [Club Man] James, how are you doing? Glad you could make it. Are you enjoying the show thus far? - Stop worrying! - [James] Oh yeah! - Oh, awesome. Great, I'll talk to you after the show. - [James] Okay. - Okay. Robert. - Yeah? - Man, you got 10 more minutes before your act goes on, all right? - Okay, man. Just trust me, black, he'll be here, man, he'll be here. - All right, make sure he'll be here. You got it. 10 more minutes, okay? - He said he'd show up, he'll show up. - [Club Man] Make sure he does. - Don't worry. Don't worry. - Trap, yeah. Now, I ain't got nothing against Russians and that, you know, but they'll buy anything from you, you know? I took a trip out there last summer. I was gonna buy, you know, 100 boxes of Cheerios. You know what I'm saying? I showed 'em selling one box of Cheerios for $100. You know? They bought 'em, I sold out! You know what I told them it was? I told 'em it was donut seeds. You know what I'm saying? (crowd shouts) You understanding? - [Robbie] Where's he at? - He'll be here, don't worry. There he is! - Hey, hey, what's happening? - [Club Man] Yo', glad you could make it! Tell me how you've been! (people murmur) - [Happnens] Oh man! - [Club Goer] Is she that bad? - [Robbie] Are you ready to go? - Man, I am ready to get busy! - Right, right, all right. What's your real name, anyway? Don't scratch your head! - Happnens. - Happnens? - Yeah. - Yo', this my man, Happnens, this man. - Hey, man, he's a bum, he's filthy! - Man, but this my act! - Look man, I'm only doing this because you were persistent. - [Robbie] Oh man. - Hey man, the next time your act comes, you make sure he's here on time. - Okay. - Hey, man, he's filthy, man. - But, he's good. - All right, then, look, I'm going to tell the people out there that he'll be the last contestant to come on. - Okay. - All right, and then, after that, he's on. Hey, man, this dude is a bum. Are you sure this your act, man? - This is my act, man. He's good, so-- - Okay, you make sure he's good. That's what I'm concerned about, all right? - Man, it's, I appreciate it. - All right, you make sure he's good. He's a bum, man. - Don't worry about him. I'm going out there and have it-- - You gonna knock 'em out? - Man, we got this-- - That's all I'm worried about. You just lay 'em out, okay? - Let me just go do this. I can do this. - Just do it, let's do it, but take a bath! - [Happnens] I know what's up! - Yeah, you know, I remember the first day of school. Me and my partners, we was all going to school, you know. You know, I was with a couple of my partners over here and a couple of my partners over there and I'm like, "What's up, partners? "This is my partner, Tyrone. "This is Jackass and this is Kevin." You know, we all talking about it and they like, "Hey, Jackass!" You know what I'm saying? They go over there. You know, "Why you call him Jackass and shit?" I said, "Aw man, we always called him that, man. "The name Jackass, don't even worry about it." Then, later, the other partner came over there say, "Hey, man, why is partner calling you Jackass, man?" Homeboy said, "Well he-yaw he-yaw'lways call me that!" (crowd laughs) (crowd claps) - Okay, wasn't he funny, y'all? Okay, let's calm down, please. Okay, for our final act this evening, we have the Bay Area's new talent. Let's welcome him, Happnens. (crowd applauds) Come on up here, now. - Oh no! - Yeah! - Homeboy, what's up? - What's up? - Hey, how's everybody doing today? - Okay. - Fine! - [Happnens] All right, I'm Happnens. I don't know who you is, really don't give a fuck but... - It's all right. - [Happnens] Check it out. - Hey, man, St. Anthony's Church is on 5th and Mission. - Yeah, man, I seen you there last time. Don't be trying to steal my bread no more. (crowd chuckles) But, you know, now and days we live in a time when you gotta have what they call safe sex, huh? Man. When I had safe sex, all you had to have was a padded headboard. These days, you gotta be really prepared. You know what I'm saying? - What the hell does this clown think he's doing. Wait a minute, man, ain't that the homie that kick at the bus stop telling jokes? - I think that is. - Got my food stamp ID card and shit. Nobody wants to give me change for a $5 coupon! I said, "This federal currency. "What the problem, dog?" Man, these butt cracks didn't even want-- - Oh lord, wait until Tori hears about this. - I'm trying to get a transfer and he don't want to take my food stamps. What the fuck's you doing down around here? You know what I'm saying? So, I got off the bus and I keep on walking. Who do I run into? Another cool little honey that want to get with me. (ladies giggle) Man, you know I got my shit together. I be walking along. She trying to get with me. She said, "Come on, get in the car." I said, "Cool." So, I jump in the ride with baby and we go for a nice, little ride and everything and you know, man, baby just pulled over, nice little spot and we had KBLX Jam and everything was going real cool. You know what I'm saying? Baby said, "Well, what you like to do?" I said, "Well, baby, you know, I'm flexible." You know I am! (crowd snickers) Baby say, "Well, I feel like, "you know, getting a little freaky." I said, "Cool." So, she took her false teeth out, then she pulled her skirt off. All this cellulite and shit popped out. Big, old, fat titties hanging down to the back of her knees. Hair fell out. I'm like, "Oh no! What's going on today?" And I really appreciate y'all. My name is Happnens. I had a good time. Thank you, see you! (crowd cheers) - Hey, must be ready to clap! Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's give all the contestants a round of applause. Weren't they good? Weren't they great? Yeah! (crowd claps) Next week, we'll have some more talent, so same time, same place. All right, thank you. (crowd claps) - Oh man! - That was so good. Wasn't he so good? - He did. - [Girlfriend] That was great. I'm glad he's made it! - [Robbie] I'm glad he made it here. - Oh, it was so funny! - Oh, thank you, I appreciate that. - Happnens, cat! - Aw man, I told you I was ready to present. - Man, I tell you, you're a shoe in for the win. You were great, you were marvelous. - Aw, right on man! - Your clothes, your act, everything! - Hold up, hold up, hold up. Okay. - You got a bright future. - All right, appreciate that, man. - I'll be talking to you! - Thank you, brother! - Yeah. - I appreciate that. - All right, damn! - Man, I'm glad everything worked out cool. We kind of came up. - Hi, my name is Todd McPherson. I'm a promoter. How'd you like to open for Eddie Murphy next week? You'll make $20,000 for a 30 minute routine. (Happnens gasps) - No shit! Next week, me open for Eddie Murphy? Oh lord! And, I was wondering how I was going to see that show! - Here's my card. You have an agent? - Oh man! Yeah, I do! - Who? - This man. - Robert Simms, the name, son. - [Happnens] Todd McPherson, son. - Todd, I in the business that one hand should wash the other, now. - So, is that a go or no? - [Robbie] Hey, it's a go. - Aw man! - Call me on Monday. I'll write up the contracts. - [Robbie] Hey, that's cool. - Happnens, you got a future. I'll see you on Monday. - Aw, thanks Mr. McPherson. Thank you very much. - Get him a bath. - Hey. Got to get you cleaned up, blood, but you on your way! - 20 G's, aww, you know I am! - Hey! - All right! - Yo', yo', dude, the outfit worked. - [Happnens] Aw man! See, I told you, man, everything worked out. Aww! - Hey, hey, hey. - Oh. Yeah, yeah, oh, man. - Excuse me while I say a few things to my girl. - Aw, Robert. Cool, man, but you know, Robert? - Uh-huh? - If it hadn't been for you, man, none of this would have even happened. As far as I'm concerned, you my manager from now on. - Hey, that's cool. That's on. - Cool. - Smile, oh, baby! - Yes, I done came up with 20 G's! Incredible! - Character number one, Troy Bradford, known as Happnens, is a very, very funny man and this is where it all started for him. Was it luck, fate or timing? We'll let you decide. - You know those people who make life hard for themselves? Well, people, I got one for you right here. Yes, I'm talking about busters. I'm talking about side-busters and this one here has a serious, serious problem. - Alvin, I just want you to cut costs, okay? - I, I-- - I don't care how you do it. - Great, I understand, boss man. - Okay. - I won't let you down. I'm not even, Bob, Bob? - Okay. - Hey, what's up? (chuckles) Tell me, what's a fine thing like you doing out on a fine day like this, huh? Hey? Hey, what's the problem, huh? What is it, I'm not white enough for ya'? - No, the problem is you're not black enough. - (scoffs) Oh, later for you guys. - Yeah, no. No, baby, the sexual issue is an all-time low priority to me. Seriously, yeah, yeah. What? No. (chuckles) No, no. Come on. What's important to me? Compatibility. Yeah, compatibility. If our personalities can't blend, you know, then it's not on. That's right, it's not on, yeah. Well, (chuckles). No, but (Alvin whistles) it sounds like you been dealing with them brothers... No, see. See, no. It's a lack-- - What's going on, Cliff, buddy? - Hold on, hold on. What? - Well, you got to end close. There's another meeting. - Look, man, I'm on my lunch hour. Okay? And, second of all, you're not my boss, brother, okay? As much as you may want to be. All right, fair enough. - Nah, Cliff, squash that. I need those reports. I got people upstairs waiting. I got things to do. I need those reports. - Look, man, I don't know what the fuck your problem is, man, but you can come see me later in my office, okay? Okay? See ya' later. Office, later. Bye now. - Yeah, I'll be there, I'll be there. - I'm sure you will-- - Believe me, I will. - Uh-huh. Hello. Hello? Hello? Damn! - Hey, Marie, what's shakin'? - What, Alvin? - Well, I've always wanted to ask you something. You're a full-blooded Latin American, aren't you? - Yes, I am. - Good. You know, you have very beautiful eyes. - Thanks, Alvin, but they're only brown like yours. - Come on, Marie. I mean, you know I've had the hots for you ever since I laid my eyes on you, huh? You don't give me the time of day. That's okay because I'll tell ya' what, little lady, one of these days you're going to wake up and all you're gonna think about is me, Big Al. - Yeah right. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to work. (Marie types) (machine whirs and beeps) - Hey, Cliff. - Hey, Laura, how you doing? - Pretty good. You know, I wanted to thank you for updating the accounts for the north wing. You know, if it wasn't for you, I don't think this company would be as stable as it is. - Thanks, Laura. Listen, what are the chances of me accessing those central area office files? I'm kind of interested in getting an idea of exactly how far ahead we are. - Sure, tell you what, I'm going back to my office in a few minutes, so come through and I'll punch it up on the computer for you. - Excellent, thanks! - Hi, you guys. How you doing? - Hey! - How are you? - Here are those files you asked for. - Oh, thanks. Sharon, how's the poetry coming? - Oh, it's doing real good! Actually, I just finished one. Want to hear it? - [Cliff] Yeah! - Well, okay. - [Laura] Go for it! - Okay. This one is called The State of The World Today. - [Laura] All right. - I often pray for the state of the world today because there seems to be a defect in the governments we elect like why money for bombs would take priority over education is totally beyond me. It seems our democracy is full of loop holes, double standards and hypocrisy. There's homelessness and hunger. The poor stay weak. Only the rich get stronger. It's a catch-22, not meant for me and you, only a select few. And, the darker your skin tone, the less you belong. Power is used in a conniving way helping some countries commit murder while others are made to pay like in Iraq. Hussein was definitely to blame, but what about the clerk? I mean, shouldn't he be charged the same? I mean, why turn a blind eye on South Africa, black lives in pain. It seems to me it's the same crime. Why not the same time? Then, there's the diplomatic bureaucracy importing all the drugs into our country, but in the end, the little dealer on the corner is the only one to pay for the sin. Even the police department paid to protect you and me. It's full of corruption and conspiracy. But, what should we expect from these hypocrites we elect? Either way, it's really sad to say that's the state of the world we live in today. - [Laura] Great! - [Cliff] That was deep! - Oh, I'm so glad y'all like it. Thank you, thank you! But, anyway, people, I-owe, I-owe, so back to work I go. Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! - Take care! (phone rings) Oh, excuse me, phone. Hello? Oh, hi, how are you doing? Listen, can you hold on for a sec'? Laura, look, I need about 15 minutes and I'll come on over and view those files, okay? - Okay, oh sure. Take your time. I'm on my way back there now, so I'll talk to you later. And, once again, thanks. (Alvin whistles) - I wish I was white. That'd be the only way I could do what he does. I've got to impress the boss to get this promotion. How can I cut costs? - Ted, just get it on my desk by Tuesday. I don't care how you do it. Just get it here, okay? - Hey, are we still hooking up tonight? Oh yeah? Okay, yeah, I can't handle that flaking going on. - How's it going? (Cliff chuckles) Cliff, did you get through those reports? - Yeah, okay. Yeah-huh, uh-huh. Be right with you. Yeah, so we... All right, look, look, look. - Come on, Cliff, we're on company time now. I'm going to need those reports. - Eight o'clock. I'll confirm my ride with you. All right, sweetie? All right. (Cliff chuckles) Take care, all right, goodbye. - Cliff, I need those reports, man. (Cliff sighs) - Buster, you got to do me a favor though. After you look at my file-- - Yeah, sure. - Find a short pier, take a long walk. There you go. - Ha. Ha. - [Cliff] I don't work for you, man. Go ahead. - I will. Okay, let's see, let's see, let's see. (Alvin murmurs) The second quarter then. Interesting! According to this, we're up to par on all accounts. In fact, we're doing better this quarter than we ever have. - No shit. - How will I know what Bob expect me to do? - What? You got a problem with the books, man? You got a problem? - Yeah, yeah! I got a problem. - Okay, what's your problem, man. - Yeah, it's people like you that make it hard for people like me to be accepted in this white-collar industry. That's my problem, pal. - Yeah, all right. Look here, man. You got an identity problem. You want to be white or something. But, don't take that out on me. See, that's the problem with us today. Instead of working together, man, we bring one another down, man. - What the hell are you talking about? You watch how you talk around these white people! They're our ticket to the Promised Land and I want in. You hear me? Well, what do you expect? It's like they say, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, huh? - My God, Alvin, Alvin, Alvin. Your nose is stuck so far up Bob's ass, it's a wonder flies ain't swirling around your head, man. When you going to realize you nothing but a puppet controlled by white strings, huh, huh? It's a shame that you feel like in order to be successful in today's world, man, you got to be white. You know, the reality of the situation is this, my brother. Take a look in the mirror. Your hair's nappy, your nose is broad and fleshy and you have a natural sense of rhythm. Well, maybe not the rhathymia. (chuckles) Bottom line is this, bruh, you're black and you always will be black and you cannot run from your identity. - No, no, man, nuh-uh. You're wrong. My identity is fittin' there. - Yeah, okay. Whatever, man. (Cliff chuckles) I'm thinking bro' has got a problem. Since things are finished here, I'm going to Barclay and see those two new recruits he just hired. There was one in spandex today. - Come in, come in. I'll get back to you later. I'll talk about it. Come in. (door knocks) - Thanks. Sorry to disturb you, boss. - Have a seat. What is it? - It seems the auditing department is doing so well, they got a lot of slack time on their hands. I mean, every time I see that Cliff, the guy's either taking a late lunch or on the phone. My proposal is this, if we can increase the responsibilities within that department, we can trim the staff thus saving the company thousands of dollars in salaries alone. - Good idea, Alvin. You keep bringing me ideas like that and you'll be promoted in no time. Now, regarding that convention, when you go down there as the company sales representative, just say exactly what I told you to say and nothing else, okay? Don't be running your mouth off. I like you, Alvin. You never overstep your boundaries. Just keep up the good work and keep bringing me those good ideas, okay? - Great, boss! Just trying to keep you happy. (chuckles) If there's anything I can ever do, just let me know. I'm your man. (swanky music plays) - It fascinates me how they tattle-tell on their own kind. No sense of loyalty whatsoever. You know, if Alvin thinks he's going to make it to the top like that, he is sadly mistaken. I think I'll just keep him around until I can't use him any longer. You know, deep down, I think he wishes he was white. (Bob scoffs) - One day, this'll all be mine. Bob won't soon forget what I did today. I'm gonna get what's coming to me. I can see it now. - Talking about backstabbers, man! Why is it that we always got to watch what we say and do, and around our own people? - Ignorance, man. I mean, it's that kind of messed up thinking that keeps things the same, even after 200 years! I mean, the guy has no respect for himself and even less than that for the next brother or sister! - Yeah, and I bet he's one of those brothers who doesn't even hold the doors open for sisters! - Exactly! I've always had a healthy respect for independent women, especially the ones with children. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to our next set of characters. Please welcome, Aminah and her son Mario. - So Mario, how was school today? - Fine, Mommy. Can I spend the night over at Mikey's? - You couldn't wait to ask about that. Yes, I already called your auntie and Auntie Malaika is coming to pick you up around six o'clock. - Yay, I like getting to be with Auntie Malaika! - But, are you going to be a big boy and do all your homework? - I'm already a big boy, but for you, Mommy, anything. - That's my boy! I got a surprise for you at home, a brand new Ace hat! - And I got you a surprise! - What? - It's a bouquet! - (gasps) Oh! - Mommy, that's embarrassing. - [Marge] Mhmm, a mother knows everything about her family. - [Lisa] Oh yeah? What's my shoe size? - [Marge] 4 big. - [Bart] How many teeth do I have? - [Marge] 16 permanent teeth, baby. (Mario laughs) - [Bart] And? - [Marge] Glow-in-the-dark monster makeup. - [Bart] Impressive. - [Homer] How many hairs on my head without looking? - [Marge] Homie, you have lots of hair! (muffled television noises) - Mommy, where is Daddy? - Honey, your Daddy won't be back for awhile. - Will he be coming back? - You see, Mario, your Daddy liked life in the streets and he got caught up in something real bad that was going on out here. I don't know why he had to go out there in the first place. Let's hope my date with Hank goes well tonight. (door knocks) Wait, Mario, I'll get the door. Hey, sis! - What's up? - Hey! - Hi Auntie Aminah. - How you doing? - Where's Mario? - He's not here. - Mikey, come on! - Him and that Nintendo! (Aminah chuckles) So, what's up, sis? How you been doing? - I've been doing fine. - Oh, that's good! (boys clatter) - You can see it, but don't take that tag off. (Nintendo plays music) - So, how's the new job? Life at the IRS treating you right. - As good as any other job. - What is this smile on your face? You got a new date this evening? - Oh God sends you and now you're daring to mention a date, I should know you by now. - Now, who is this guy? Tell me about him. - His name is Hank. - Hank? - And, he's cool. - Oh, so he's cool, huh? What else do you know about this guy besides the fact that he's so cool? - Well, I know that he's fine and I know that he's a youth probation officer. - Now that's cool! He has a job and everything. But, honey, this is the 90's and you have to be careful, learn what's on the inside of this man. You be careful, honey, this might be a snake. - Hey. When are you gonna let me grow up and start living my own life? - Honey, I don't care what you say or how many times you say it, you gonna always be my little baby sister. Now, I'll be damned if I sit back and let you continue to make mistakes after mistakes-- - After mistakes, after mistakes. That was in the past. When are you going to let me grow up and run my own life? - Honey, I'm not trying to run your life. I'm just concerned of men. You know, I admit you're doing fine as a single parent, but see, I can't relate to that, but watching raise Mario, honey, I know it's hard. - Oh no, you don't know how hard it is. You have a big, six-figure digit job coming home with a husband, the white picket fence, the whole nine. While you sittin' up there in the hills, I'm sitting down here. You don't know how hard it is, so don't say you know hard it is because you don't. - Why every time I come here, I have to argue with you because you think I'm trying to run your life? - You are trying to run my life! - I'm not trying to run your life! I'm just a little concerned. Let's reminisce. - Let's not! - Remember when that asshole, Amiricol, was around? How you thought he was so sweet and sexy? Because, you see, every evening he came by here, he bought you all these little dead-ass roses. He nibble and kiss on your navel and your thighs and after all that shit, he asked you to get out of his life and he ends up being the biggest asshole in Oakland. - Well, for your information, it's none of your business if he was an asshole! Amiricol was a good man to me when he was around and he was a good father to Mario when he was around. You don't know! You come from your goddamn fairy-land world across the way coming over here trying to run my life. A male's already a good thing for me, so don't come over here and start no shit with me! You always pull that little baby sister shit and I can't take it no more! I don't want that little baby shit. For your information, me and Amiricol had a simple misunderstanding. - Simple misunderstanding? Honey, you mean... First of all, understanding is the most important essence in any relationship and you mean to tell me you call a simple misunderstanding someone who tells you, not asks, but tells you to have an abortion when you nine months pregnant and after he realized he can't take care of responsibilities around here of raising Mario and being a father, he tells you to get the hell out of his life and you do and do he ever care? Hell no! So you don't come at me about no simple misunderstanding. To me, my sister, that was a big misunderstanding. Look, Aminah, I did not come here to argue with you. - Well, just leave then! - Aminah, honey, I'm sorry. Look. Look, look, look at me. You are a beautiful, independent black woman and I want you to hold on to that image. I'm not trying to run your life, honey. I just love you. Come here, give me a hug. I love you. (video game blares) - Come on, Mikey, let's go. Take off my hat. - You do love me. Come on, boys. Is all of Mario's stuff in this bag? - It's all in there. - Come on. God, y'all slow as kids. Give your Mama a hug. - Come here, child. Bye, baby. Have a good time. - Oh, we will. But, you be careful, baby, okay? And watch this. (Aminah sighs) - I'm glad that's over. I'm ready for my date with Hank. (swanky music plays) - Damn, was that another steps? Let's see. 301. 302. 303! All right. Let's get it together. (door knocks) Yeah, I think it's cool. - Hi! - [Hank] Hi, how you doin', Aminah? These are for you! - Oh, thank you! Flowers, wine and candy and stuff. Come on in. - Thank you. - [Aminah] Well, have a seat and make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. - [Aminah] I'm gonna go put this in some water. - Okay. Mmm, yeah, it's on tonight. (TV sounds play) Hey, Triple Flick Justine. - Lord knows he needs it! (track laughter plays) Oh Daddy, these are the kinds of times, I just don't know. Lord, baby, go and pray for me. - Hey, Pop, guess what? - So, food's almost ready! - [Hank] Thank you. - In the meantime, why don't you tell me what it's like being a big youth probation officer? - I like it, you know. It gives me a chance to work with the kids. I listen to 'em, I listen to their problems, talk to 'em, tell what they gotta do, listen to what their parents are doing with them. They just give me a chance to work and really give back to the children of our community. I mean, we got a few knuckleheads in the bunch but we work those out too. We work them out. So, how is your job at the IRS? - I don't want to talk about it now, but we still work people a lot doing the same thing, you know, but... - When is the IRS gonna come see me? - Oh, they won't come rip you off. I'll make sure of that. - I like that. So, how is Mario? - He's not in tonight. He won't be in. - All right. - Getting pretty hungry? - [Hank] Yeah, yeah, I am. Is that lasagna you making? - Yes, I'm going to go see about it and why don't you go wash your hands and the food will be ready. - Okay. (music plays on TV) ♪ TV Network number one ♪ - Yeah, that was good. All right, good. - You liked the food? - I can't say enough about it really. - My grandmother says I'm a great cook too. - Really? - I'm glad you think so. - What about later? What else do you have for me? - All that depends on what subject you talking about. - Subjects? I'm not talking about subjects. I'm just talking about physical, me and you. - You mean like physical exercise, golf, what? Sunday morning jog? - Naw, not jogging or exercise really. Physical exercise within the house. - (chuckles) Watch what you say, Hank. - But, what are you talking about? Would you like some more wine? - No. - All right, I guess I'll have it. - You don't need anymore either. - Naw, I do if I got to talk to you. I need this. (low tones play) Come on, come over here. - Now, Hank. - What you talking about? - I don't want you to get the wrong idea. - Nah, nah, darling. Don't start tripping now, you know. - I'm not tripping. - What are you talking about? - I'm serious, Hank. I'm serious! I didn't know you were this aggressive , Hank! - Damn! (Hank sighs) Damn. Why? Why are you tripping? So, why are you frowning? Wipe that frown off your face. What you tripping off of? Get that frown off your face. Aw man. I ain't gonna be chasing you all over the place. Hey, check it out. Let's just work this out. Why are you still frowning? Why don't you just wipe that off your face? I thought I told you to wipe that off your face. Come here, just, we can work it out. I just need you to come here and give me a kiss. - Yeah, kiss your ass, all right. - Damn, bitch. She's trippin', man. Trippin'. - Shit, Malaika was right. When are they gonna learn? This is the 90's. Just because a woman's alone does not mean she's lonely. I can't believe those Judo lessons actually paid off. - (chuckles) Well, I guess she showed him a thing or two, huh, Kendal? Kendal? Hey, man, are you listening or what? Kendal, what are you looking at? (distant shouts) Kendal? - Here we have some of the most interesting bunch of characters you've ever seen. Do you guys know what bad b-boys are? - Hell, man. - Trip them people in there, dude. - Yeah, fuck them, man.

He goin' out like a twister. - Look at Sammy laying down like a spoiled sardine fresh out the can. - Man, look at this, man. - He just fall asleep on the bed. - He left the game bag. - Damn. - What a back alley fool, man. - What's up with him, man? - Jesus. - Man, I give up, dude. I give up. (phone rings) - Man, get off my phone, man. - I'll take it. - Can you believe it? Missing out on an opportunity like that? (Kendal sighs) And, they say that drugs are a great aphrodisiac! Well, people, you figure it out. - Excuse me, how are you? - [Partner] Victoria, Victoria! - I hate it when that happens. I speak and get no reply. (scoffs) she probably has guys coming for her all the time. That's why she doesn't have any time for a nice guy like me. (sighs) She is beautiful though. That's, I think, what we'll do for our next character: the irresistible bitch. Well, let's get busy. - I believe in you. - I want to make sure this is right, so sometime of the weekend, can you pass over this? - I promise, I won't lead you astray. I'm in this with you all the way. I didn't make it to where I am by trying to act cute, okay? I made it to where I am today because of my persistence and my knowledge for marketing. I believe in you and I'm sure that once the school receives my letter of recommendation, you'll be just fine, but you must promise me one thing. - Sure, anything. - That you let this be the least of your problems. - Thanks, Victoria. I hope that someday I'll be as successful as you are. - You will be. Take care of yourself. - Okay. - [Victoria] Enjoy the weekend! - Hey, hey, hey, sweetheart, sweetheart. Hey, hey, what's up? Hey, you know, I'll do anything to get to know you. I'll lick the paint off your toes, girl. I'll even drink your dirty bathwater. I'm dying to meet you. Here's my card. Give me a call. My name is James, James Bond. I already know who you are. You're Victoria, Victoria Darling. I've checked your background. Now, let's talk about your future. - You've done your homework. - Yeah, well, forget you too. Mind, body and soul, I'm going to have you, gal. They like a big mind, god damn. I'm all in. Fine though! (slow music plays) - Yeah, Sandy, I know. Mhmm. Well, I probably won't make it to the comedy competition, but I will be there this evening, definitely. Yeah, I feel like I need some friends. Yeah. Okay, so I'll see you then. Okay. Okay, bye-bye. (slow music plays) No Anthony, I'm sorry, but I can't see you this evening. It's ladies night out which means that I'm too committed to having fun on my own with my girlfriends. - That's cold. I was looking forward to eating you out this evening and finishing up with a slow, long grind. - This evening, you're just going to have to beat your meat because that's the closest you'll get to having me. I gotta go now. - That bitch! I ain't gonna take that no more. I always say that. That shit just too good though. Ah! Yes! (Victoria sighs) - I wonder what tonight has in store for me. I haven't been out to party in a long time. I'm looking forward to it, dammit. I'm going to have some fun. (swanky music plays) - [Bouncer] Hold up, man, hold up, hold up. - What's up, dude? - You guys are dressed inappropriate, man. I'm sorry. You brothers can't come in the club. - Man, what's up! - Man, I'm in a comedy show in there, dude. - Sorry, brother, your comedy routine is funny as hell, but you guys are dressed inappropriately. You can't come in. - Oh what! Come on, man! - Damn! - This fool. - What is this, man? - You know what I'm saying? - We can't even go in the club, man? We just come to spend a little money with you. - [Bouncer] You guys are dressed improperly, I'm sorry. - Man! - Fucking excuse there, man! (men chatter) - What's up, what's up, what's up? How you doing, man? - I can't even get in this club, man. What's up, dude? What's up, man? - Yeah, come on. - Anyway, first of all, this is for VIPs. Y'all can't go in this way anyways. (men groan) Second of all, the whole gang dressed improperly. Look at you in your tennis shoes, man! Man. - Man, what! - When y'all gonna get some class about yourself, my brothers. (men chatter) - [Second B-Boy] That's a problem? - Man, that's part of the problem. You ain't growned up yet, you know? You're still running around here like you're in the wild, wild west. - [Fourth B-Boy] Come on, dude. Man, come on, bro'. - I tell you brothers what, you come back and we're gonna get you all a job. Hey, what's up, dude? - Hey, what's happening? - Hey, y'all be safe out there, you hear. - Aw man, he's just in polyester, man. - Some shit. - I'll give your motherfucking sister a job. - My man, you's a sucker, man. - Like you all that, like you all that. - Can't even talk to these fools. - And that bodyguard? Damn, homie. Yeah, I got my mind. My mind playing tricks on me. You know what I'm saying? - Man, you little motherfucker, I'll kick your ass. (swanky music plays) - Seven. Eight. Nine. 10.

(slow music plays) - So, have you ever been with a real woman before? - Well, no. - Stop. Stop! That kind of stuff only happens in the movies or in The Twilight Zone somewhere. It never, ever happens to a guy like me. - Interesting. I see a very articulate, well-dressed brother that it's obvious that he has a great deal of self-esteem and is well-respected by the people he talks too. He also seems like a brother who has not forgotten his roots. Let's kick it right here. - [Pam] Shylo? - Pam! Aw, shit! - [Pam] How you doin', what's up? - Come here and give me a hug, girl. How you been? - What you up to? - Oh, just handling. - I'm doing good. Look at you. Big time investor! I don't believe it. I never thought you'd amount to anything. - [Shylo] Shows you what you know! - Guess I don't know nothing! (Shylo laughs) Boy, I thought you'd still be running around here acting like an idiot. - Go on with that. - Just like when we were kids. - Get out of here. - This dude used to really piss me off. - Get out of here. - (sighs) You remember that time we snuck out the house and went to a Nicks party? - Around the corner! - [Pam] Yeah, yeah! - Oh, it was popping the most that night. - [Pam] Wasn't it though? - Yeah, it was. - And look at you now! I'm proud of you. - Am I looking good or what? - Well, hello, Shylo! - Oh, excuse me. - So nice to finally meet you. - Yeah, it's nice to meet you. - I'm Susie. - Uh-huh. - I've been wanting to meet you for a long time now. - [Shylo] Oh. - I've admired what you've done for the community. - [Shylo] Thank you. - You're one of the best music managers in the business. You know, I've been trying to get into the business myself but I've been having a difficult time. Do you think maybe you and I could possibly work together? Here, why don't you take my number and give me a call. - Okay. Massan! - Shylo! - How you doing, my man? - I'm all right. - You still playing ball? - Nah, man, I'm furthering my education, man. - [Shylo] Hey, that comes first. - Yeah. - [Shylo] Yeah. - I just wanted to tell you thank you because you're an inspiration to me. - Hey man, it's just one brother helping another, you know? - [Massan] That's right. - We got to help each other around here. Positive. Listen here, y'all, I hate to sound rude but I have a couple of acts performing down at the Vintage Inn tonight. - Oh! - You guys know where that is, right? - Yeah. - Sure. - Okay, well, look, if you get a chance, stop on by and I might even have some passes for you at the front door, okay? - Good. - Y'all be safe now, you hear? - Okay, see you, Shylo. - Call me! - Sure thing! - You gonna be all right? - Yeah, I'll be fine. - Okay, you got some money now? - Yeah, I have plenty. - Okay, don't get in no trouble now. - I know, I'll be good. - You know it's rough out there in the whole thing. If something comes up, you give me a call. - Okay, as soon as I get in. - Okay, do that now because so many things been happening out here, and I don't want to be worrying about you. - I'll be careful. - Please do! - I will. - Okay, now you heard about that other girl that got, they messed her around and the homegirl still hasn't recovered. - Is that right?

Y'all should be working like a dance team out there. Help each other out! Keep your hands up and your feet moving. Billy, make sure everybody touch that ball one time before you shoot, you got that? And, lighten up on that dribbling. You dribbling too much. Okay, run it with some authority. Keep them passes, Chris! Slam it. Move that ball, move it. Defense, keep them hands up and the feet moving. (Shylo laughs) Keep them hands... Move it! (coach sighs) What's wrong, Billy? Get it going! That's it.

What can I do for you today? - It's like this, I want to sponsor shoes and uniforms for your team this season. - Well, what brought on all of that? - I have so much money, I just don't know what to do with it. (laughs) Plus, remember the back in the days when I played. This white man bought everyone on the team swing pro gear. - Oh, Miles' kid. - You remember. - Yeah! - We all thought we were players after that! (both laugh) - Y'all been bustin' great. - Anyway, I thought I was a pretty cool thing for him to do, so I just wanted to try my best, you know, give something back. - Shylo, old boy, it's quite a gift. - Hey-- - I won't argue with you. - All right. - I just thank you!

All right, Billy. Now, hold on, Shylo. Offense, let me see that offense and then run it with some authority like I showed you. (whistle blows) And, make sure everybody touch that ball one time before you shoot it. Shylo, boy, I don't know how to thank you, partner. I'm so grateful. All right now, you better watch yourself, - Now, be sure, hear? - Okay. - You old goat! - Get on out of here, sucker. Billy, make sure everybody touch that ball one time before you shoot it!

What you going to say to him today? - Damn, Shylo, you always scoring touchdown. - [Mean Girl] Ew, look at ugly Shylo! - I got a girlfriend. You ain't nothing but a brick in the wall. - In the brick in the wall? Well, you know you like me. I'll always be the star of your dreams. - Shut up, Lizard Woman. You'll never be the star of my dreams. - Baby, if you had dreams, trust me, I would be in them. - [All Three] You little momma's boy. - [Shylo] If I hear you say that again, I'll whip the black off of you. - [Mean Girl] Why don't you say that a little louder, Shylo, so your mother can hear you because you got a real filthy mouth. - Boy, you better watch your mouth. You don't talk to little ladies like that. Now, the next time you say something, you're coming in this house, you hear me? - [Shylo] Yes, ma'am. - Haha, Shylo! (Mean Girl giggles) (boys groans) (swanky music plays) ♪ Yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ - Dang, it's dark already. I got to plan some shit. (machine beeps) - [Woman] Hi, honey, it's me-- - Baby. - [Woman] I guess I'll call you later, okay? Love you, bye-bye. - Love you too. - [JR] Hey, homie, what's going on with that hoe? - Hey. - [JR] It's JR. You ready to get live? Give JR the call, please. (machine beeps) - [Mother] Hello, son, this is your mother calling. - Hi mom. - [Mother] Why don't you ever come visit anymore? Are you eating right? - Yeah. - [Mother] Call me. - Okay. - [Mother] I love you, son. - I love you, Ma. That's my mom, boy. - [Ryan] Hey Shylo, this is Ryan. The business deal came through! (Shylo cheers) Business, man! - Yes! - [Ryan] I just told Walter and Cam. - We really know. - [Ryan] Me and the boys will be down at the Vintage Inn celebrating. - Cool. - [Ryan] Come on down and slam some brewskis with us. If you can't, if you can't make it, I'll see you bright and early Monday morning. - Cool. - [Ryan] Peace. - Peace! Shylo's come a long ways. You should be proud of yourself, man. Just think, back in the days, all I used to do was reek havoc. I must admit that playing by the rules is a lot more rewarding. I love you, my brother, peace. (phone rings) Hello, Shylo. - Hello. Hello, darling. How are you? Are we still compatible or did you drop me for someone else? - Fahte, you know you're my favorite person and personality. I guess you have the right to jam me up. I'll tell you what... - Okay. That sounds sweet to me. Should I drive? Okay, I'll be ready and waiting. See ya', bye-bye. (Shylo laughs) - Boy. I must admit that working hard definitely does pay off in the end. (Shylo exhales) - [Bill] You know, I think that girl, Victoria, liked me! - [Kendal] (laughs) Get out of here! - [Bill] She did! You didn't see her eyes, dude. - [Kendal] Oh, man, get out of here. I seen them eyes. She probably had a boyfriend. - Eyes for me, that is. - Aw! Well, what are you gonna do tonight? - Oh man, I'm meeting my girl tonight. I'm sorry. - Are you sure? We could catch some checkers or something else. - Yeah, but I've been waiting for my girl for the longest, man. - All right, I think I'm going to go to work on our paper. - Cool. (men shout) - Virus, she's waiting for the mailman. She want some dope, so she beat a dope man. He knows he's hooked, he's sprung on crack and you can tell the way her boobs-- - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! (men chatter) (woman hyperventilates) - Now, there's a guy who could give us character analyzation. - We don't have enough time to do anything with that one. - But, I've got my pocket recorder here-- - [Kendal] You'd need a whole book to tell that story. Besides, we out of time. (bus crowd shouts) - I'm goin' downtown, baby. Kendal, it's your turn. What's wrong with you? - Naw. - You know, ever since you got back from your outing, you've been all polite and considerate. What's going on? - Baby, it ain't nothing. I'm just going through a little bit of a character change. Money! Cool, you see that? (slow music plays) - [Bill On Recorder] On this particular day, Kendal and I had the opportunity to study a small sampling of people. We've chosen to call them characters. The perverse please of studying these people in a variety of situations, their actions and sometimes even their thoughts, has brought us to the conclusion that everyone is definitely in a world of their own. As people, we must look inside of ourselves before we can begin to understand or pass judgment on others. We hope our paper is providing you with some insight.
