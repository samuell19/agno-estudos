Your name is Ana Walker. Your father died when you were ten. And you've missed him every day since then. When you were 12, you went to sleep one night, and as you were lying there in the darkness, you felt this sudden wave of dread. You couldn't breathe, couldn't move. It was at that moment you understood what it means to die. This fear of non-existence. That was a long time ago, but sometimes the fear returns. You have a boyfriend. And he loves you more than anything in the world. Problem is... Hello. It's so beautiful, Mom. Are you coming to see me tomorrow? No. I can't visit you tomorrow, or the day after. I just told you, we're in France. Do you hear me? It's very important you remember what I tell you now. Your desires are like guiding lights shining through from the future. You have to know who you are. Understood? Mom, I have to go now. It's expensive to call from here. I love you. I don't think she knew who I was. I don't know why you keep calling her. It only ever brings you down. Come on. Stop it! Oh, my God, is he insane? He's going too fast. It's fine. Guy's probably driven this way a thousand times before. God, he's texting. Close your eyes. Okay? - Just count your breaths. - One. - Relax. - Two. Three. Four. Shit. You okay? It... it hurts. You hit something? I just want to get out. - What do you mean, you wanna... - Now. What are we supposed to do now? Can you just check Google? We're out of range. What's this? Police, medical assistance. I... I feel safer that way. Well, whoever wants to save his life will lose it. Where did you hear that? I can't remember. All right. Come on. Let's just go back. Catch a bus to Dijon and get on the train there. What about money? Well, we have enough to get there. We'll just get a different job. We have a plan, let's just stick to it. Okay, then where's the damn house? I don't think this is the right place. It's not supposed to have a fence. Look. Isn't the same house. Bonjour. Bonjour. - Hello? - Hi. We're the, uh, the guys from the ad. Yes, of course. So it's... it's here? Just, the place looks different. It does? My name is Richard Rolle. Ana. Has, uh... Has France lived up to your expectations? - Oh, it's beautiful. - Yeah, we're loving it. Wow. We have to go there. It's, uh... It's quite a walk, all the way around the other side of the village. Are you hungry? Come on. Please, come in. Make yourselves at home. Wow. It's like a museum. Yes. And, uh... I am the curator. So many beautiful things. Must have cost a bit. Well, it's amazing what one can achieve by thinking. When you're ready, the kitchen is downstairs. Want some? How is the food? Very good. Yummy. Exquisite. You know, it's not often we get Americans looking for work in this part of France. Yeah, well, we're not all fat bankers smoking cigars. Maybe we're not thinking enough. Anyway, Dick, what is it you want us to do here? Well, uh... There is a lot to be done. I have a... an area which needs to be cleared of rocks. I have some trees which need to be cut down. There is a wall at the end of the garden which is in need of repair. I thought guys like you had gardeners. If I had, I wouldn't meet interesting people like you, would I? What about the locals? What about them? Well, I'm just saying, can't you hire any locals to do it? They are just old and decrepit. What are you paying? Tom. Do you have to be so... Two hundred euros a day. Plus a very nice room for you both upstairs. Full board. We accept. Well... You live here alone? Not anymore. We are set. Ah, can you believe this house? And the wages? We will be filthy rich. Just... don't ruin it. Please, Tom, don't ruin it. - What do you mean? - I mean, this big macho idiot that lives inside you and will get you killed one day. Come on, "Dick"? What? I was just being friendly. What an asshole. I didn't like his food. You didn't? It wasn't a burger and fries, was it? Behave yourself, or I'll kill you. "Your"? When will you learn how to spell, dummy? Called me dumb? Yeah. You're a dummy. Oh, I love it when you call me dumb. Yeah, you're a dummy. Yeah, you're a dummy. Big, dumb body slam. Oh, no. Tom? Hey. What's wrong, babe? Bad dream? I was in a hospital. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. I could just watch. There was this man... with a needle. It was just a dream, baby. I didn't feel like a dream. It felt like when I dreamt about my father. I know. He was already on his deathbed at that point. I feel strange here. And I think we should leave. You gotta be kidding me. We need this money. Something bad will happen. What do you mean, something bad's gonna happen? The worst thing that can happen is if the fucking freak goes insane on us. You don't think I can handle it? There you go. Look, you're safe with me. Okay? What's wrong? Ah. Be more careful. Come help me. I can get tetanus. It's just a scratch. Hello? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. No way. - Just... - Please. Don't ever go into the barn. Of course. I just thought someone was crying. No. Just must be the wind or something. What happened to your hand? Yeah, I was just digging up some stones and... I'm sorry. I Should have given you gloves. But I forgot. You know, it's nothing serious. Yes, well... We should disinfect it. Come with me. So, you're a doctor? No, I'm a serial killer. Does it hurt? No. We're a very long way from the nearest hospital. So... one has to be, uh... self-sufficient. I hope you know what you're doing. I often have to help out the locals. The petit doctor they call me. I used to be sick a lot when I was a child. Do you have any, uh... health issues? I'm allergic to the pollen of, like, every plant. Asthma symptoms. But the allergy's gotten better since we got to France. Let me look. Your eyes look normal. I think everything should be fine. You should go and meet your boyfriend. What the fuck? Tom! Yeah. What are you doing? Nothing. Let's go. American cuisine night at Dick's bed and breakfast. Aww. Thanks. Took a lot less time than boeuf bourguignon, I can assure you. Excuse me? Eternity, you have, uh... - Oh. - ...Rimbaud on your T shirt? Yeah, I like his poetry a lot. Well, we were thinking after dinner... It is found again. Is Rimbaud popular in the U.S.? I don't think so. My father was a teacher and he was his favorite poet. He used to talk about... Well, this was... Yeah. This is... this is lovely. Yeah. I think Ana and I will go and take a walk before it gets dark. Ana wants to go and see the lavender fields, don't you? So, yeah. Do you have the remote for us? I have only one. Right. So, uh, are we your prisoners now? And what was that all about? What? Your homeboy routine. What else? Can't you see how embarrassing it is for me? Oh, I'm sorry. I just didn't realize you were gonna talk about your father with the first fucking person you met. Are you jealous? Am I jealous? Fuck, no, I'm fine. Just sitting there listening to you and some French faggot recite poetry. Look, I'm not gonna have this conversation with you right now. You're delusional. Oh, you started it. What's he waiting for? Oh. It's you. Welcome to France. Jeez. No TV. No WiFi. It's like the Middle Ages. If he's got any Rambo in English, let me know. We'll see what the fuss is all about. Check this out. Faulty copies. Maybe he bought them wholesale to appear well read. These are like new. This one's old. Do you think... he collects defective books as a hobby? Won't be the weirdest thing about him. Check... this out. Mm. This song. Oh. Hmm. That's weird. This is fucking freaky. You know what? Let's go to the city. We've been trying to call a cab for the last, like, 30 minutes. You're telling me nobody answers their phone around here? No. Why don't you try again? Let me try again. Wow, that's funny, isn't it? Why? Why are there graves in your garden? What? I didn't want to scare you after the dream and all. Four graves down by the pond. Yes. So what's in them? Dead bodies... of my dogs. I can give you a shovel. You could dig them up and check for yourself. What about the strange books and vinyls? Tom. - Strange? - Well. they're incomplete, aren't they? Which is my memory of them all. What the fuck does that mean? It's what I remember. All right, you know what? We don't like what's going on here. Why? Have I harmed you? Harmed us? No. No, you see, I wouldn't allow you... to harm us. So why don't you just tell me what the fuck is going on here? If you don't want to do this job, I'm sure I can find someone else to do it. I can pay you for what you've done, and then you can go. It's raining. Well, I can't account for the weather now, can I? Fuck you. Sorry. Tom. I need help! Help me! I don't know... I'm really... I'm really afraid of dogs. Please! I need help. Get the syringe from the chair. Now stick it in. - Where? - Right through his rectum, dammit. Oh, please. Not too fast. Count to three. One, two. Three. Keep it down. Count to three one more time. One. Two. Three. A major cluster seizure. Diazepam... is the most efficient way to administer if you can't find a vein. I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you. Are they all sick? Their genes are sick. The whole breed. When they're born as little puppies, they have, um, their deaths buried deep inside them. And as they grow, so does it. And then one day, yeah. But they're all different. Freddie, he's so obedient that I sometimes think he has no will of his own. But this other one, this other male... He's completely useless. Afraid of everything. What's his name? Only Freddie has a name. Why? Names create bonds. You gave Freddie a name. Yes. And that was a mistake. You're awake. Where have you been? I just went to get some water. What's wrong? Nothing. - What are you doing? - We're going south. Sorry for not listening to you before. What... What are you afraid of? What do you mean? I thought you were the one that was afraid to stay here. I just overreacted. I had a terrible dream. I... I like it here. Oh, you like it here now? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, we can stay. What is it that made you change your mind? You don't know? You're fucking crazy sometimes, you know that? You're fucking crazy, like your mother. I have to take a leak. Of course. Be my guest. Ana. I'm feeling dizzy. I think I may fall. Please get me some water from the kitchen. What are you doing here? You know those graves? Were you going through his private things? I saw him hiding something in here, okay? Show me what's in your pockets. What? Show me what's in your pockets, Tom. What do you mean? There's nothing in my pockets. I swear to God, I've never even seen those before. You promised you'd never do it again. And I didn't. What have you done, Tom? Do I really pay you too little? This is like the most primitive set up in history. No, go on, then. How did you get them in my pocket? - Tom! - No. Shut the fuck up! I know where you went last night. - Don't you fucking lie to me. - How dare you! - Dare... - Enough! There'll be no more shouting in my house. You're nothing but a thief. I'm calling the police. Stop it! He's sick! Oh, fuck. Ana, I'm sorry, I... I'm so fucking sorry. Leave her alone. Get out of my house. This is fucking crazy. I'm calling the cops. Go ahead. Yeah, let them fucking see what's going on here. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Police? Yes, police. You're inside of me. Understand? There can only be one alpha male in the pack. You either accept the rules, or you die. Mr. Dawkins? Your name is Tom Dawkins. You had an accident, and we made you sleep for 12 days to protect your brain. - Where's Ana? - Miss Walker is with us. - Did you get him? - Who? The fucking psychopath from the house where... where we had the accident. Your accident didn't happen in any house, Mr. Dawkins. You were traveling on a bus and it rolled over. You were lucky, too. A whole family died in that mess. No. No, no, we were... No, we were on the bus, and then we went to the house. It's the man with the dogs. That is what propofol does, Mr. Dawkins. Vivid dreams. - It was a dream? - A dream. Sylvia... I want to see her. You've been lying next to her for two weeks. Today, you have to rest. I want to see her. Please. When will she wake up? Maybe tomorrow, maybe years from now. Years? We have a patient here who has been in a coma for four years. We were unable to contact Miss Walker's mother. She's, um... She's in a mental hospital. No other relatives? I don't understand why... Why aren't you helping her? Of course. There's verticalization, massage, hydrotherapy, music therapy, even dog therapy. You're not doing anything. After a severe trauma bodies switch off the brain, so to say, to save energy. Keep it from damage and facilitate healing. It will turn on by itself. When? If it's ready. I want to see her. Today, my job is to prevent infections and bed sores. This is the real field of medicine. But if you need faith, how many more would sell your soul? Now comes the hard part. Her mother's sick. No other relatives? I don't know what you want. I know this is very premature, but if Ana goes into a vegetative state, she becomes just a body connected to machine. Would she like us to sustain her life by artificial means? You gotta be fucking kidding me, right? 'Cause... Don't get me wrong... You realize there are many people she could help. If you so much as fucking touch her... You have a problem with aggression, Mr. Dawkins. You can't breathe in here. Let's get you some air. Where's Tom? He took his things and left. I was just packing. I'll go with Tom. I just need to speak to him first. Can you please bring me my phone? Richard, I'm sorry... for him and everything. I met you. So it's worth it. I'm sorry. Who is he? You must be joking, Mr. Dawkins. - Get back to your bed. - Who is he? Who? The man in the bed next to Ana. Who is he? He's a patient. And we don't divulge personal information. I saw him when I was in my coma. What's strange about that? You saw his face while you were still in shock, straight after awakening. So how did I know his name? It's written for everyone to see. On his hand. Please... just move Ana to my room. There's nobody else in there anyway. No. She's in a coma. She stays in a coma room. You're not in a coma. You stay in a normal room. I still have no information regarding your insurance, by the way. You have to go to your room. It's been three hours. Propofol? But the doctor mentioned... you'd die if you took it. Only if you overdose. Why are you asking? How are you feeling? I have to go back. You know, you can stay here for as long as you want. That doesn't feel right. I feel so confused. I need to call my mother. I need to see her. She needs me. Do you have a return ticket? I have to pay you for the work you've done, so... you have money. Yes, we'll finish tomorrow. Are you okay? Yeah. I just feel very cold. I think I'm gonna go to bed. You shouldn't stay out too late. Shit. I'm so sorry I left you there. Ana. Go back to your room. Get out. Allez! - Fuck off me. - Move. A grown man. Do you have anything to say for yourself? We are a hospital with weak security. I know there's something going on here. There is? Apart from you sneaking around like a burglar and sleeping in other patients' beds? "Other patient"? It's my fucking girlfriend. When I was asleep next to her, I swear to God... Now seriously... do you want me to call the authorities? Sign on the dotted lines. You release this hospital from all responsibilities and demand an immediate discharge. No. No, I'm not signing that. You can still visit your girlfriend. For now, I just don't want you staying here. You're making our job harder. I'm still sick. You can't just make me leave. If you're worried about your health, there are hospitals in prisons. What, you send people to prison for things like that? If they break into confidential areas first and steal life-threatening medication, why not? Yes. That's on record, too. Come in. Breakfast is served. Voila. I dreamt about Tom. He was so weak. Also bruises here and here. Probably just a magnesium deficiency. Nothing to worry about. I'll give you some supplements. You're not hungry? I just want to go to the lavender field. Are you afraid of that place? Let's finish the garden first, hmm? It's going to rain all next week. And one other thing, I'm beginning to look a little bit like a vagrant. And Freddie's a terrible barber. Thank you. Yeah, it's ready. Papa is going to be a handsome man again. The fucking psycho liked to play doctor when he was little. This place is perfect. I don't think the roses will grow here. It's too shaded. Come on. They'll grow just fine. No, if you really want the rose garden you've always dreamed of, over there would be the best place. They're always bullying that one. Why won't you defend him? That would be the stupidest, most dangerous thing you could do. Never get between them. Promise me. Even I don't try to separate the dogs when they're fighting. No graves in the real garden. Hey. Yo! Here. Yeah. Uh... Bonjour. Hey. Bonjour. Uh... Are there any lavender fields around here? Lavender? - Ah. La lavande? - Yes. Yeah. In the south? Not here. There's no lavender fields here? Okay. Um... Are there any graves? Graves, like... Um, dogs? Yes. Okay. I... Yeah, I get it. You should have names. Big beasts. Bobo. Oh. Fast and furious. Mika. Mm. Poor little non-alpha male. You should be called Susu. Hey. Hey. Everything is the same. Just like I saw in my coma. Fascinating. I don't give a fuck if you find it fascinating. The fact is that we were trapped in there, and now she's in there alone. So why don't you just - fucking listen to me? - Enough! I have a hospital to run. Hey! Hey, fuck you! Can I see your photo? So... he was telling the truth. Who? He had pictures like these in his house. Where'd you get them? One year ago, we had a boy. He was in a coma after a bicycle accident. Adrian Bosolei. When he woke up, he said he had been in a house with a man and his dogs. Just like you. I have to talk to him. Two weeks after he left hospital, he died suddenly of a brain aneurysm. Who is this Richard Rolle? He made his money on new brain scanners. Four years ago, he called for help and he was almost dead. And they brought him here. What happened to him? Police said that... his dogs... Attacked him? Oh, Jesus! Fuck! Tom... Even if these dogs are there, it's just a dream. Yeah, but they are there. Fuck, how could I be so fucking stupid? Okay. So how did they, um, wake up this, uh, Adrian? His parents were sitting in his bed and talking to him about his life for hours, as if they were living it once again. Baptiste laughed at them, but... maybe it worked. Yeah, maybe. Please... Please, will you help me move her? Listen, you can always try to move her to America. Why don't you call the embassy? Because I'm on probation, and I left without permission. That's why. Hey there, trouble-maker. How're you doing? Yeah, me too. I don't know if this is gonna work. Here goes. Your name is Ana Walker. Your father died when you were ten. You've missed him every day since. I can't. I need more time. What is time? What is time? When you were 12, you went to sleep one night, and all of a sudden you felt this... wave of dread. I love you. I love you. Couldn't move, couldn't breathe. You always said that that was the moment you learned what it meant to die. I'll care for you forever. You have a boyfriend and... It's me, by the way. And he loves you. He loves you more than anything in the world. It's just... You know, I wish you could hear me. I really do. Just give me a sign, just... anything. Please, Ana. What... Ana! No, no, no, no. Oh! Ana, please. Come on, wake up. Wake up Ana, come on. Ana, wake up! Get the fuck off me! Unlawful use of a taser with exposure of hospital personnel - to direct threat of life. - Fuck you! Don't you come anywhere fucking near me. He's killing her. He's sucking the life out of her. What is it that you don't understand? You'll land up in prison, Mr. Dawkins. The police are coming. Prison? This is prison. I'm coming for you. Hi. You've reached the Inpatient Psychiatry Unit at Memorial Hospital. Please leave your name and number and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Tom? Tom! Arret! Freddie, arret! Hey, Freddie, stop! It's him... Tom. He... He was there! Out there in the field, going away. He looked like... like a ghost. What are you talking about? I feel something bad happened to him. Please, let me go there. - I have to... I have to see him. - Wait. Why don't you call him? Call him. Fuck off already! "Your"? When will you learn how to spell, dummy? He was stealing, Ana. - I... I, I was just looking... - It doesn't matter. You can do whatever you like around here. This is your home too, now. What do you need? I'm just getting a bit restless. I would like to take a walk. - So take a walk. - Outside. You mean, to the village? The village, the fields. I need to be alone by myself in any environment. I'm sorry, but... I've lost the remote. That's fine. I can climb the wall. Don't look at me like that. I'm not doing anything wrong. Police? I think I'm being kept against my will in the house of Richard Raw. I think he might have killed my boyfriend. Ana! Ana! Trois, deux, un. Come. - Are we dead? - No. Our brains are just functioning on a different mode. Sleeping and dreaming. I want to wake up. But you can't. What is outside? Your juvenile boyfriend? Poverty? Your mad mother? Outside, you're sick and wounded. Inside me, in this house, you're safe. There's no passage of time. But I want to see the world, have experiences. I feel suffocated in here. I have so many dreams. How did you get in here? Your dogs. They killed you. I am not dead. So no one killed me. They assaulted you like they did Susu. That's why they have no names. - It was my fault. - What are you talking about? I tried to separate them when they were fighting. And they turned on me. I should have known better. If we're in your head... Our brains are synchronized at the same frequency, like radio waves. But this is your world, not mine. Can you imagine... living here alone in this house... all these years? I was rotting in the hospital, trapped in my own body, trying to contact someone. Anyone. So I'm your entertainment. My first success was getting my dogs back. I'd already dug their graves. I could hear them shooting them one by one as the paramedics took me away. And then one day, they came back to me. There was a boy. He was in a coma in San Juan Hospital. I could feel his presence so close to me. And then one day, he appeared. What happened to him? I had to watch him go. Can't you make me go? If you really love me. You don't understand. It is either here or nowhere. I have a gift for you. One... two... three... What have you done! Oh, what have you done? This is a crime. Even a life like this is sacred. Whoever wants to save his life will lose it. You know what we have in common? We're both fighting for survival. I don't wanna live like this. Ana. Dinner is ready. Hey, what's up, buddy? Mm? Don't worry. Everything is going to be fine. Ana! You're not hungry. Very well. Don't! What an asshole. - They'll kill him! - They will kill you if you come between them. I'm already dead. Leave him alone. Leave him alone. So I'm your entertainment. I think he might have killed my boyfriend. Freddie, no! I love you. I love you. Oh, my boy. You will never wake up. Look at you. With your varicose veins and your white hair and your bruises, you'll rot away in your bed. That will be your freedom. Get her. Get her! You don't even know their names. Bobo, Mika, Susu. Tom. - You have to live, Ana. - No. No. No.
