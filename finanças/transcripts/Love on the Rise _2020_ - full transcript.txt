Were they happy with it? Beyond happy, like over the Moon happy. Good, I was a little worried. The mother of the bride was super intense. Well, she loved it. Another smashing success. Yeah. This one's coming along nicely. You think? I don't know, it needs something. I think it's pretty good. The bride's gonna love it. Good? Good is not good enough. You're such a perfectionist. You know as well as I do, this is a competitive industry. I just want enough constant work coming in where we don't have to stress the small stuff, like rent. Tori, you are going to be the hottest cake decorator in town. All the brides are gonna line up for your amazing wedding cakes. Relax. We have no time to relax. Look at all this work. Although, I really love it. Speaking of love, when are we gonna make one for you? - Don't go there. - Oh, come on. I'll help you set up an online dating profile. They make it so easy these days. Um, no, not happening. Besides, right now, I'm focused on making Cake very successful. Well, I'm glad you're happy, but I just wish you had someone to share it with. I'm sharing it with you. That's not what I meant, you know it. We have a lot of work to do, okay? Focus, tomorrow's wedding is a high-profile affair, and a show-stopper could really catapult us to the next level. Yes, all the rich and famous will be there, but no stress, right? Right. Did you get a deposit on this one? Um, I mean... You can't be a pushover about these type of things. I know, I know. As your business partner, we need deposits, especially on big orders like this. And I know you always have my back. Tori, I just wish you'd understand your worth, you're amazing. And one day everyone will know that, too. Well, thank you, and I love you for saying that, but can we get back to work now, please? You got it, babe. Are you sure you don't need my help? Go home, I will get someone to help me when I get there. Fine with me. And can we talk about this cake? You have outdone yourself again. Thanks, Steph. Okay, go, enjoy your night off. I hope you get to rest one of these weekends. Rest, what is this rest you speak of? And that's why you're the cake fairy. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye. Did you see that? What? They were checking out your suit to see if it's made out of husband material. Yeah, they seem nice. Nice? Hank, if you think that they're so great, you should go talk to 'em. Jake, you don't seem to grasp that just by dropping the name Jacob Adams III, doors open for you. The trust fund doesn't hurt either. And that is exactly why my father likes having you around the office. You could learn something from me, Jake. You and your father would actually get along if you agreed with him more. Let me explain something to you, Hank. I've known since the age of five that I was gonna be working for my father. It's a great job. And I think that there's more to life than just making money. My father spent my entire childhood working, and you know, wasn't really there for me. I fail to see the downside of being rich and famous. Oh, boy. - What? - Lacey. - Where? - Six o'clock. Oh, wonderful. What happened with the two of you? You guys grew up together. Yep, our parents were both part of the club. Rich socialite turned Internet star, seems nice enough to me. Well, you and I clearly have a different definition of what nice is. Jake, darling, is this where you've been hiding all afternoon? - You caught me. - I sure did. How are you, Lacey? Yes, Hank. So, Jake, when do I get to see what you and the firm are working on? Well, you'll get to find out when the rest of the public does, Lacey. How about a sneak peek? My viewers would love it. Uh, another time. Well, if you guys will excuse me, I need to go make a phone call. Lacey, you look good in purple. Hank, stop trying so hard. Oh, hey, hello! Me? Yes, can you give me a hand with this? Well, I'm actually just taking a little-- Look, I don't wanna bother you, but we both know you shouldn't be on break till later. Chef would not be happy to see you slacking. - But I'm actually, I'm not-- - Please. Really quick. Just grab the other end of the base, and help me get it on the cart. Yes, ma'am. All right, oh, wow. - It's heavy. - Yeah, okay. Oh, whoa! - Careful. - Sorry. - Is this your first day on the job? - Ah, sorta. All right. Wow, that is one fancy cake. It must be scary driving with one of these in the back of your truck. It's definitely nerve-racking. Well, the owners must have a lot of faith in you. Not to brag but I am with the owners. Okay! No, I really didn't mean for that to sound bragging, promise. It's okay, it was a humble brag. I'm just teasing you. If you're pulling gigs like this, you must be doing something right. Thank you. It's hard work but I love it. Shoot, I think I forgot my notes. Did you check the itinerary? - Itinerary, uh-- - Oh, never mind. I keep an extra one in my pants. It's okay, you know, it'll be between us. Good. Can you open that door for me? Thanks again, for helping me get this in here. Of course, it was my pleasure. I have to get it prepped before the end of cocktail hour. You should probably get back to chef before he notices you're gone. Right, back to chef. Well, it was really nice meeting you, uh... The cake fairy. Victoria Worthington, but you can call me Tori. All my friends do. And you can call me Jacob, but, er, Jake. I'm just Jake. Thank you, again, for the assist. If you don't go, you're definitely not gonna make it past the first day. Right, I'm gone. Well, I hope I see you around, cake fairy. Me, too, just Jake. Okay. - Where have you been? - Oh, nowhere. Just getting some air. - Henry, the usual? - Yes. Hi, Henry, how are you? - Keep the change. - Oh, thank you, Henry. Say hi to Ruth for us. Hi, guys. Hi, Victoria. Quality control. Let us know how you guys like it. - Very good. - Good, good. Here's your cake. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You guys have a good day. - Thank you, Miss Victoria. - Bye. Oh, no. - What? - Hey, Victoria. Brandon. I missed you. Yeah, it's been a while. How is Jessica? Well, that's why I'm here. Oh, so... We're getting married. And I couldn't imagine getting the cake for the wedding from anyone else but you. - Congratulations. - Thank you, thank you, yeah. So, can we come in next week? Yeah, sure. You are the best. It's great seeing you. Did you just agree to make the wedding cake for your ex-fiancé and his future bride? Isn't that the girl he was cheating on you with? - Well-- - You are not making that cake. He is taking advantage of you, just like that society bride from last week. Yes, but that was a great job and I wanted it and it gave us great exposure. People died from exposure in pioneer times, Tori. Well, maybe at some point, when we get more established, I won't need to negotiate. You need to stop selling yourself short. I love you but please, no more discounts. You are worth it. And no more freebies to the neighbors. Oh, come on, I love making those kids happy, and they always order their birthday cakes from us. You know what goes around comes around. You have a big heart, I don't want people to take advantage of you. I know. I don't know what I would do without you. Thankfully, you'll never have to find out. We cannot get the maximum density for those units without the approval for the adjacent land where that strip mall is located. We have already committed the funds on this. Get the approvals and make it happen. Yes, sir. Now, I'm a little worried about that strip mall. Those small business owners could cause us a lot of trouble if they get wind that we're gonna tear down that building. There is nothing they can do. They'll just have to find another place to do business. Don't you agree, Jake? What? Ah, yes, absolutely trouble, I agree. Okay then. We have to minimize any media exposure and just push these approvals through. Hank, that was nice work squashing that news story the other week. Last thing we need is any bad press when we're so close to closing this deal. Now, have we stopped to consider that maybe there's a way of doing this without displacing these businesses? What do you mean? This could be a death sentence for these stores. I'd hate to push out hardworking small businesses. Small business, they aren't even in our league. The size doesn't matter, Hank. This blows up in our face, we could have a PR nightmare on our hands. Maybe I could look into an alternative option, one that cuts out that part of the development. Absolutely not. We need those extra units. Money doesn't buy happiness, guys. Do we really need those extra units? It feels greedy to me. I'm not interested in happiness at this juncture. We just don't need any bad press before we break ground. Are we clear? Yeah, yeah, we're clear. Run me down on the next conference coming up here. Southeast Developers convention, it's next week. Good, and our flights? It's here locally. Hi. - Tori, I have bad news. - What's going on? This is bad, this is real bad. Your car's in the shop and you need the van again? No, this is serious, come on. Okay, what is it? Let me explain, sit down. Remember when Adams Development Group bought our building last year? Yes. Oh, no, are they raising our rent? Worse, okay. So Adams Development Group is planning on evicting all the tenants, bulldozing our building, and building condos. You're joking, stop it. I swear on our secret cake recipes it's true. Oh, my gosh. You're serious, this is bad. But don't worry. We're gonna protest, shut them down. Steph, how are you gonna stop them? It's not easy to take on a big fish like the Adams Development Group. They have so much money and they own the building. Oh, my gosh, we're gonna have to find another building, I guess. Our location, you can't beat our location. Tori, we're gonna fight them. We don't have the money for another deposit, and then zoning the kitchen for all of that ventilation - and the industrial oven-- - Tori. - All of our stuff is already there. - You're not listening. We're gonna fight them. Listen, if David can defeat Goliath, then we can defeat the Adams. Okay. Okay. Listen, if something is this important, you have to stand up for it. You're right. You're right, this is our bakery and we're not gonna give up without a fight. Yeah! What is our plan? It's time for arts and crafts. Okay. I think that one could have had bigger lettering. Yeah, it just-- - It does. - Okay. I'm kinda nervous. Don't be nervous, just hurry. A lot of people should have. You know what? I'm gonna catch up with you after a caffeine break. - Oh, right, just hurry up. - Okay. Hey, Tori, long time no see. Yeah, I know. Can I get you a cafe latte? Nope, today is a big day. I need something extra strong to get me through this. Foggy misty mountain, I'll throw an extra shot in. I don't even know what that is. It will get the job done, just trust me. - It is on me. - Thanks. Hello there, cake fairy. Fancy seeing you again. It must be your lucky day. Wow! Those are really fancy rags for a waiter. What? Oh, yeah, uh... It's my one nice suit. I had an interview this morning. Getting another catering business so soon? Well, I mean, uh, they say that you should dress for the job that you really want. But hey, catering definitely has its perks, too. I keep meeting interesting people. Hey, Tori, here's your foggy misty mountain. - Thank you. - Small black coffee. Really, a foggy misty mountain? Don't ask. I should probably get going. Are you off to do some cake fairy magic? Thank you. No, I'm meeting up with some people and I'm sure my friend is chomping at the bit for me to get back. Hey, I have the perfect idea, you should join me. If not, then keep me company when I walk. My afternoon schedule is clear, so, how could I say no to the cake fairy? Wow, you are really up a mission. Where we going anyway? Well, I know this is crazy but I'm going to a protest rally. I've never been to a protest rally. I haven't either, actually. Did you go all the way to South America for your coffee beans? Funny, Steph, real funny. Who is this? Jake, this is my business partner and best friend, Steph. This is the waiter who helped me with the cake delivery the other day, Jake, just Jake. It's nice to meet you, Just Jake. Is that Swedish? Not Swedish exactly. So, what is this for? Oh! These dirt bags are trying to pave our store and build new condos, so we have to stop them. We're going to Adams Development Group. Ah. Oh, man. Look at the time, you know, I... I really should probably-- I thought you said you are free all afternoon? - We could use all the support we can get. - Yup. - But, I-- - I could use the help. Yeah, I just, I wasn't planning on doing-- Please. Come on, please. All right, sure. Perfect, here, take this one. Oh, this one's yours, and I'll give you another one on the way. Hey guys, Tori brought a new recruit. - Where is everyone? - I called everyone I know. - I created an event online. - I posted on all the bulletin boards, but I guess no one wants to upset the Adams. Maybe people are just too busy. They're gonna have a lot more free time on their hands after their shops are leveled and the condos are built. Whatever happened to civic duty? - Maybe more will come. - I hope so. But we're gonna need an army to beat the Adams machine. Until one arrives. This have to do, come on. Okay, guys, I want you to keep the energy high and stay loud. We're gonna have a reporter coming to get us on the news, so, I really want to make an impact. Okay, let's go, and remember what we rehearsed. You ready? Hey, hey, ho, ho, Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho, Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho, Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. More of them than I thought, this is not on TV camera. Don't worry, JJ, Mr. Adams. It'll blow right over. Call security, have them removed. Will do. And next time, call the police. Have them cited for trespassing. Look at that one who won't even show his face. Where's Jake? He went to get a coffee around. Probably stopped at city hall to get the updated permits. He's got to stop leaving the office during strategy session. I agree. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Guys, this isn't working. I mean, we need more people and where are those cameras? Yeah, maybe we should just go home. There really is nothing we can do. We can't fight these big developers. You guys, we cannot give up now, okay? What are these faces, come on. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go! Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho, come on, Adams family has got to go. Okay, people, game's over. This is private property. Leave now or I'm calling the cops. You can't crush our livelihood. Yeah! Go protest on something people actually care about. This isn't over. Leave, or I'll make you. Okay. Did you see that? I don't know where the reporter is. She said she'd be here. Who knows? At least, Paula was recording. - Hopefully, she'll post it. - Couldn't hurt, although I'm not sure any of this is really gonna do any good. Persistence, cake fairy, persistence. Here, thanks. What was that for? I don't know, I'm just, I'm really happy you came with me today. It means a lot. I'm glad that I could help even a little bit. I know we didn't get through to them but it makes me hopeful. You see, the Adams Development Group is planning on tearing down the building where I have my bakery. It will probably put me out of business. Tori, I'm so sorry. No, you don't have to be sorry. It's not like you're behind any of this. Still, what's life without cake? True, thank you. Didn't the queen once say, "Let them eat cake." Marie Antoinette did say that, yes, but I don't think she meant it in a good way. Well, I do. In fact, maybe we could do this again sometime. Another rally? Oh, no, no, no. I meant something a little more one-on-one. Are you free Saturday night? Aren't you working Saturday night like everyone in our industry? Oh, yes. You know, I was testing you, and congratulations, you passed. I mean, our Saturday, Monday. You open Monday? Hmm. Okay, deal. I know the perfect place, actually. All right. Well, I'll see you then. Okay. You are right on time. My punctuality is not to be questioned. Well, my apologies. Don't laugh at me but this is one of my favorite places. What you got there? Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice, it's one of my favorites. It's remarkable. I've never found it in an old print like this, though. I know it's silly but I just, I adore old books. You know it was loved and shared by so many people. And it's such a classic story, I never get tired of reading it. You should get it. It's too pricey. I'll have to stick to my paperback reprint. I'll get it for you. Special book for a special cake fairy. No, I could not accept expensive-- - But I-- - Seriously. Okay. It's probably one of the kindest things though that anyone has ever done. Almost done. It's the thought that counts, so, thank you. You are full of surprises, Tori. I know that. Someone's in good mood today. Could it be some handsome fellow from the rally? Maybe. Wait! Shut the front door, spill it, spill it now. We went out. And? And he seems like a really nice guy. He's so real and sincere. He might be your unicorn. I know. He actually does seem too good to be true. Tori, you're too good to be true, too. I'm just happy you finally got a guy that gets you. I hope so. So, when are you seeing him again? Later this week. Hmm, look at you out on a school night. He said he had some catering gig during the day, so, we're gonna meet up after. He wants to take me to some late-night spot. Ah, color me impressed. So what are you gonna wear? Oh, come on. You have to send me all the photos. I have to help you figure this out. I'm not letting you dress me for this. That's what you think. No. There you are. Hank. What's up, man? Did you see it? Did I see what? Your father is not going to be happy. What is he not gonna be happy about, Hank? It's gone viral. What has gone viral, Hank? Where were you the other day during that protest? What protest? There were a bunch of people out there with signs about the development. Look, if you've got something to say, man, you should probably just say it. Someone recorded it and posted it online. It's had more than 50,000 views and counting. Oh, no. The part where Adams security runs them off the property is extremely heartwarming. Makes us look less than heroic. Game's over. This is private property, leave now. That would constitute less than heroic. You can't crush our livelihood. Yeah! Got to go, hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Game's over, this is private property. Leave now or I'm calling the cops. You can't crush our livelihood. - Oh, boy. - Yeah! Go protest something people actually care about. Leave now or I'll make you. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey. I thought you had this handled? I did. I got rid of the reporter. Well, this is worse. A TV reporter would have shown this for three minutes at most. It doesn't help that security was a bit overzealous. He was just doing his job. That's putting it mildly. It has more than 300,000 views and people keep reposting it. Pause it. Right there. Pause it right there. She's the face of this protest? I wouldn't worry about her. She's probably harmless. Online, they're calling her the cake fairy. What a stupid name. I kinda like it. I looked her up and she's one of the tenants we're going to displace, a baker of wedding cakes and sweets. She's a rabble-rouser. She must be stopped. Is she really that important? I mean, we do have this little matter of freedom of speech to consider and we really should be trying to put out this dumpster fire instead of making it worse. Just make this go away. Dad, the Internet is written in ink. We've been getting calls all day. Contain this, or I'll hold you personally responsible. What, I wasn't even here. Yeah, that's another matter. Where were you? I was out running some errands. We have people to do that for you. I expect you here when I need you. Yes, sir. We need to use every connection we have to make this go away. Get the mayor on the line. Oh, the tenants. It was a really good choice. I still cannot believe we went viral. Yeah, you sure did. I bet the Adams are not happy. Although, I'm not sure I ever saw a cake fairy as being a symbol. I'm kind of embarrassed by all of the attention. It's a lot. That was so Steph's idea. She is the adventurous one and I'm just the baker. You are the cake fairy. And like it or not, people will look to you. People have been ordering a bunch because of it, because they wanna join the cause and eat some cake. All press is good press. I think we can really use this momentum and give our cause a voice. See you soon, love you, mean it. Ugh. Okay, fine, I will share. Hmm, oh, yeah. - So good, right? - So good, here you go. All right, so you never owe me. Here's your dessert. Hope you'll enjoy. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Yummy. - Looks delicious. Just a little Victoria-sized bite. Here it comes. Mmm. Mmm. You're gonna regret this. What? We only ordered one of those? Yeah. That was a mistake, a big mistake. Oh! Okay. Lacey's latest, the what's what about the who's who. If you've been wondering where our local most eligible bachelor has been hiding these past few weeks, look no further. Jacob Adams III was followed tonight canoodling with some mystery girl. She's the reason we haven't seen much of him lately. Is it serious? Hmm, only time will tell, but based on this handsome millionaire's track record, it's only a matter of time before she's one of the books, and he's on to the next flavor of the week. Have you seen it? - Seen what? - Lacey's vlog. No, I haven't seen it, because I'm not 12 years old, and I don't care about some silly gossip blog. Vlog, Jake. Blogs are typed and so 10 years ago. Sue me for not caring. Why would I follow Lacey's vlog and hold the phone? Why do you follow Lacey's vlog? I mean, I like to know what's going on. - She's well-informed. - She's a predator and a social piranha. Harsh. Look, I know that you have this fantasy of the two of you getting together, but that woman would sell out her own mother, if you got her more followers. - Harsher. - But true. I barked up that tree once upon a time, and trust me, it is not worth it. Just do yourself a favor and don't. Can you explain this? I was having dinner. Have you lost your mind? That's the girl from the protest video, the cake fairy. The only acceptable explanation is that you're using her to get information to help the company. As a matter of fact, we're sort of-- Don't say it! Dating. Geez, no! No, Jake. JJ will disown you. What are you thinking? You're not gonna believe this. What? She doesn't even know who I am. Everyone knows who you are. Not her. She thinks I'm a catering waiter. A waiter. That's hysterical. Yeah, I met her the other week at the wedding. Is that why you stepped out of the party for 30 minutes? I stepped out because of Lacey, you know that. So then what? I ran into her again at the coffee shop. - And? - And, she dragged me to the protest. How could you be so brainless? I'm going to have to tell JJ. Please don't tell my father. You're really putting me in a tough spot, Jake. I'm gonna come clean to her. How about coming clean to your father? Whoa! One step at a time, Hank. Fine. But you have to fess up. I don't wanna see you take a dive because you mixed your work life with your personal life. I know, I know. I'm gonna figure it out. I just, please, please don't tell my father. I love the smell of fresh cakes in the morning. It's my favorite, too. Speaking of favorites, how are things with Mr. Wonderful? I really like him. He is kind. He's sweet. He's handsome. And you like him? I do. I do. You know, I was thinking the other day, I don't exactly know much about him. Ask him questions. I have. And? And he changes the subject and makes it about me. That's different, I mean, in my experience, most men just want to talk about themselves. I know. It's kind of refreshing. Maybe he's hiding something. Oh, don't say that. Maybe he's married. Stop it! Maybe he's on the run. From what? Maybe he witnessed a crime and he's in Witness Protection. Okay, that got weird quick. - Maybe I'm overthinking it. - Yeah. But I think you should just ask him flat out. If he's in Witness Protection? No, no, ask him to open up. If you want to be in a relationship, Tori, it starts with openness and trust. I feel like he's the most trustworthy guy I've ever met. Well, then you just have to get him to communicate. Tori, I want you to have your just desserts. Okay, I hate when you use that line. But it's so good. - Okay, I'm gonna go check our paper work. - Okay. Well, hey there, Hank. I was just passing by and saw you sitting here all alone. Hi, Lacey. I was just watching your vlog. How are things? Amazing. Just finished a series of interviews about being a social media influencer. These days these companies are lining up to have me talk about their products on my channel. And the vlog's got more followers than ever. You? You know, the same old-- - Same old. - Same old. I miss you, Hank. We had some good times, didn't we? Not really. Well, what about the time we crashed that wedding? I wasn't there. But, what about the time we were at the yacht party with the ice sculptures? I wasn't there either. How could I forget? Lacey, you always just ignored me. Whenever we were together, I was just a third wheel for you and Jake. Well, I think it's time we changed that, don't you think? I wouldn't mind. We should go out sometime. I'd like that. Oh, but first, out of my professional curiosity, and for the love of my viewers, I have to know who is this girl I saw Jake with? What's that all about? This isn't some jealous ex-girlfriend stuff, right? I want no part of that. How little do you think of me, Hank? I was just imagining maybe, just maybe, we can all get together and go on a double date. You mean that? Yes. Yes, I do. First, I have to know who this mystery woman is. Not sure. Well, what's her name? Her name is something I forgot to ask him. Well, how could you not know? You're his best friend. - I do know one thing. - What's that? She doesn't have an ulterior motive like you do. Have a great day. Oh, hello there, cake fairy. Hello there, Just Jake. So, what's our plan today? Well, I actually have a favor to ask you. Okay, ask away. You know, this beach community that you're a part of, I've never actually spent any real time here. I was hoping that maybe you'd take me on a tour and show me why it's so special. You wanna go on a tour? - Do you like the idea? - I like it, I love it. Just keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Shoe? Forget about it. Come on, let's go. - I know the perfect places. - Right. This is so beautiful. We made a good choice. It's literally like a postcard. Look at the dolphins. Do you see them? What? No way, that's amazing. I see them up and down here all the time. - Do you really? - Yeah. At sunset, the sky glows and the water sparkles. - It sounds so nice. - It is. Hey, do you want something better than nice? Fine. - Whoa. - Check it out, the tsunami roll. Wow, that looks uh, that looks like pure happiness. Oh, it is, it really is. You wanna split it? Normally, I would say yes, but no. What? - Come on. - No. Okay, I will make you a deal. Since you ordered their famous fresh fruit sandwich, we can go halfsies. You drive a hard bargain. Is it really that good? - No, it's better. - All right. Here you go. I just love how the sand dunes go on for miles in each direction. It's amazing. You know what else is amazing? You. - Stop it. - No, I mean it. I've never met anyone like you. Well, you know, that's not necessarily a compliment. This time, it is. You're so passionate, and driven, and... Yeah, I... I just really had a great time. Stop it. Flattering is gonna get you nowhere with me. Now, follow me. It breaks my heart that this could all go away. Because of the developers? Yeah. I mean, look at this place. It's not just that it's beautiful. It's something that mother nature gave us and you can't just manufacture this town's character. Why would anyone wanna bulldoze this to put up a bunch of condos? Look, Tori. There's something that I've been meaning to tell you. What's that? I... Come here. You're so serious. Come on. I... I just, I really like you. I really like you, too, Just Jake. I'm glad that we could clear that up. So, how was the beach adventure today? It was so great. Well, while you were gone, a certain ex called to set up his cake consultation. Oh, my gosh, I forgot. Yeah, I hope you're charging him double. No. I'm not. - What? Tori, come on, after all that-- - Shhh. Typical, hmm. Brandon. This is Tori. You're gonna have to find another cake decorator for your wedding cake. You have already wasted way too much of my time, and I'm no longer your door mat. As far as I'm concerned, you two deserve each other. Have a really nice life. Bye. Finally. Oh, that felt so good! So good! - Yes, okay, cheers. - Cheers. Okay, let's talk numbers so I can get my new cake mixer. You wanna roll that by me one more time? I'm just saying that maybe we can find somewhere else to build the development. Jake, do you have any idea how much money has already been invested in this? This is prime real estate. Have you spent any time down at the beach? Any real time, Dad, not just surveying property lines? It's beautiful, and it's calming, and it's charming, and-- And what were you doing down there, Jake? If the press saw you-- No one saw me. I just, I needed to know for myself why it's so special. I can tell you why, and it's green, it's very green. That's not it at all. It's uh... Special, dad. Special doesn't matter. This is business. Money isn't always the most important thing. What's so funny? If money doesn't buy happiness, why does everybody always want it so badly? I just don't understand why he's not willing to cut out that part of the development and just leave it alone. I don't understand why you're surprised. It's just gonna cause bad blood with the community. Again, have you met JJ? Yeah, I really thought he'd care. Not to sound heartless, but that kind of sentimentality has no place in business. Get your head out of the clouds and back in the game. Game? Game, Hank, what game? This isn't a game. People's livelihoods are at stake here. Everything is a game, Jake. There are winners, and there are losers. Never forget it. - Thanks. - Thank you. Don't you just love wearing other people's shoes? Oh, come on, they're stylish. All right. Okay, here we go. ♪ See, I like your style ♪ ♪ I like the way you live ♪ ♪ I like the way you smile ♪ ♪ You're designed for me ♪ ♪ No place I'd rather be ♪ ♪ We fit perfectly ♪ That was awesome.

Is that what I think it is? What? Come with me. Oop.

It certainly made me popular at weddings. Do you have any other hidden talents? I don't know many guys who like to dance. No, actually, I haven't been dancing in years. And I forgot how good it can feel when you have the right partner. Okay, so, let's see, what have we learned tonight? Well, we learned that you love to bake and bowl and that you are one heck of a dancer. You know, from where I'm standing, you're actually pretty good at everything that you do. Compliment me all you want, it's not gonna change your bowling score. Wow, okay, nice. It can be our little secret. What secret? - That you can't bowl. - Ah, yes. And I definitely can't bake either. We're quite the catch, aren't we? You certainly are. Mm, come on, let's get out of here. Listen up, everyone. The Adams Development Group is about to tear down a big chunk of our town. Once it's lost, it's gone forever, replaced by some commercialized-- Boo! - Formulized-- - Boo! - Homogenized condos. - Boo! What happened to her? I don't know but I love it. I think she's just tired of people taking advantage of her. People with a dream. Well, our dream is about to be bulldozed next month. Adams has plenty of space to build condos. Why do they need to tear down the small nook of businesses in our area as well? We need to protect small businesses that support our community. The days of mom and pop stores will be gone forever, unless we stop the Adams Development Group. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho. Adams family has got to go. Well, I know who you are. And I know who you are. What now? For starters, you can call off this development and find another place to build. I can't do that. Sure, you can. I don't think you realize how developments work. You do realize the impact of these condos. You're gonna upset the natural balance and turn this place into some generic suburb. Well, I appreciate your concern. But this is progress. And you can't possibly think that you're gonna be able to stop progress. Look, Mr. Adams. I know you're used to getting your way, and using your wealth to get what you want, but we're not gonna give up. You got spunk. I admire that. This project is gonna move forward whether you like it or not. Have a nice day. Wait, hold on a moment. Oh! This makes things really interesting. Jake. Can you help me out? I'm trying to track down the cake fairy. You. - Come on. - Okay. So, this is where all the magic takes place. Well, I wouldn't call it magic, but... Magic is an understatement. Holy cow, this is phenomenal. What did you put in this, magic fairy dust? That's cute, I see what you did there. Seriously, this is incredible. It reminds me of a lemon cake that my grandma used to make. I haven't tasted anything like this in years. Was your grandma a baker? No, not professionally, but man, oh, man, she can bake. She was a tenacious little thing kinda like you. I think you two would have been friends. I bet. You know, I've never seen my father as happy as when he would eat Nana's famous lemon cake. It's wild, it tastes exactly like this. Do you guys still have the recipe? No, no, sadly, it was her little secret. My father, he lost his sweet tooth after she passed on. I'm sorry. It's kinda tragic. Well, this cake is kinda magic. I am the cake fairy after all. So, listen, there's actually something kind of important that I've been wanting to talk to you about. Is something wrong? This is gonna be hard, um, I don't quite know... Hey, you're making me nervous. Are you sick or something? No, no, no, it's nothing like that. In fact, I've never felt better. And I think that someday, this is gonna just be something that we look back on and we laugh about. Okay, then what is it? So, the day that we met, I wasn't-- Sugar, I'm back. Hi, Just Jake from the rally. It's good to see you again, Steph, and it's Just Jake. It's Just Jake. He remembered my name. I like him, can we keep him? I'm a hugger, come in. Let her give you a hug. Just take it, she gives great hugs. Yeah, anyone who keeps smiles on this one's face is all right in my book. Well, I don't wanna overstay my welcome, so. Don't you work here? Yeah, but you know, I have to go change the month on our puppy and hot guys calendar, so I'm just gonna make like an atom and split. You two have fun now. See you later. How would you like to be treated to a pizza tonight? What? A weekend night off, huh? No cakes? No cakes. Well, how come? Are the locals going on a diet? That's not even funny, mister. I seriously cannot believe I got a Friday night off though. Oh, no, ah, shoot. I just, I remembered just now that I promised my dad that I would, I'd take him to this special showcase and it's out of town, - and it's really important to him, so... - Yeah. Of course. But believe me, if I had it my way, I would much rather spend my time here with you. No worries. It's good to be with family. Well, I will call you later if I get back in time? Yeah, yeah. Oh, wait. You said you were going to tell me something important. Yeah, it can wait. Okay. She's spicy. I'll give her that. She's got the mayor's attention and-- I thought he was in our corner? He is. He was. He's getting pressure from the community. They're pushing for a special council meeting to discuss the development plans. Can't our lawyers handle this quietly? Can we get an injunction? Our attorneys are looking into it. Son? You're awfully quiet about this. Well, she's got the moral high ground. What do you want me to say? We need to squash her like a bug. You need to get your act together and pull your weight around here. Sorry. Really? Now you're lying to Victoria and your father. You know this isn't going to end well. What do you care all of the sudden? Huh? You're always about business and sucking up to my father, Hank. I believe in what your father stands for. Don't give me that progress nonsense. Jake! End of the day, you're my buddy and I don't wanna see you fall apart over this. That might be the single most selfless thing you've ever said. Man, I hang around you too much. Just figure this out because if your father finds out, there is nothing I can do. Cake fairy here. Actually, I think we can accommodate you. The turnaround will be pretty tight but we're gonna make it work. Amazing. Yes, you know what, just email me the design photos and I will get started right away. Yes, it's on the website, of course. No, thank you, you're so welcome. I will see you later tonight. Okay, bye-bye. Oh, my gosh. Let's send you those cake photos. What was that all about? It was someone from the Blue Lounge at the North Beach plantation. They're having big political gala for the mayor to speak in and their cake person canceled last minute. I guess our elusive Friday night off isn't happening. It's all right. Jake is just me, takeout and a cheesy TV movie. You make it sound so glamorous. Oh, I know, because I'm living my best life. Tell me they're paying us extra for the rush. I didn't even have to ask. They brought it up. Yes, the universe always provides. Oh, wow. Yeah, these are gorgeous. It's not gonna be easy. Well, we better get started then. You know what to grab. Yup. ♪ Let me get to know You better ♪ ♪ I love the way you live ♪ ♪ And so much more to know ♪ ♪ Rooms to go ♪ ♪ We can put it all together ♪ ♪ 'Cause we've Got this feeling ♪ ♪ And it feels like hope ♪ ♪ Rooms to go ♪ ♪ You make it easy You make it bright ♪ ♪ Got me believing Feels so right ♪ ♪ No need to wait We can get it now ♪ ♪ And if you honor You can come around ♪ ♪ So sit down with me ♪ ♪ You captivate No time to wait ♪ ♪ I can see it clear ♪ ♪ Maybe we can start Right here ♪ ♪ Let me get to know You better ♪ ♪ I love the way you live ♪ ♪ And so much more to know ♪ This might be our best work yet. I think turned out okay Okay? Seriously, this is work of art. It's gonna knock their socks off. Thanks, Steph. Here you go, fine sir. You and the wait staff have given me excellent service this fine evening. Oh, I get it, it's because you think I look like a waiter. How clever. And? Your French is horrible. And she still thinks I'm in catering. You didn't tell her? I knew you wouldn't tell her. It's a hard conversation to have. "Hey, Victoria, my father is the developer "that's trying to squash your business." - That's great, start with that. - I can't do it. I've tried, and-- The longer you wait, the worse it's going to get. And my French is pretty good. I can't remember the last time I saw you this happy. For the first time in a long time, things are finally going my way. Are we talking about cakes, or a certain handsome new friend? Maybe both. All I know is I just wanna know everything about him. I think I can really see a future together. Maybe we're gonna make you that cake after all. It's all down to the wire now. Just need to get it passed by the city commission and we can break ground. Sounds like an excellent investment. Adams Development Group has always been the star of my investment portfolio. I'm sure the views from these new condos will cost a fortune. Well, that's the idea. Yeah, it's very nice. - So glad you all could come by. - Thank you so much. Yeah. Gotta love these parties, huh? Well, hello, darling. I'm not your darling. Last time I saw you was at the wedding reception, then you disappeared. I was feeling a little stuffy so I decided to get some air. You know, you keep pushing me away, but when you finally come to your senses, I'll be gone forever. Forever and ever, amen. That's a sweet expression. Much like a delicious cake. I don't follow. I'm onto you, Jake Adams III. Your little friend, Victoria? Does your father know you're dating the queen of the protesters? Look, Lacey, I don't know what your game is but you better-- Cheeky way, it makes me sad when you say things like that. Fine. What do you want? - I'd like we're together. - No way. I just want someone to dance with. You got about 10 seconds, lover boy, or I'm blowing your cover. Fine, deal, just for tonight. Mr. Adams, it must be my lucky day to be here with such handsome gentlemen. It's good also nice to see you this evening trying to civilize my son. He's easily trained. - Hey! - What? Check it out. I thought you said he was out of town this weekend? Apparently not. Who's that girl on his arm? I don't know. I'm about to go find out. Keep setting up. Jake? Um, hi! What are you doing here? I thought you're out with your father. Are you lying to me? I can explain. I'm not sure how you're gonna explain this. It's pretty clear you're a player and a liar. No, no, no, no, that is not it. How do you have time for all these women in between your catering gigs? Victoria, I-- Young lady, this is completely inappropriate. Bad enough you trespassed on my property for your silly cause, but now you stalk my son? Son? What... You're his son? - Yes, it's complicated but-- - You're one of them. Oh, this is rich. Victoria, this is just a big misunderstanding. Okay, I tried to tell you but then we kept getting sidetracked-- So, it's my fault that you managed not to tell the truth? No! Are you spying for your daddy? - No! - I cannot believe you played me like this. Hey, come back, Victoria! Hey, it is not like that! Everything between us was real. Yeah, sure. I am such an idiot. I cannot believe I fell for you. You are just like everyone else. Take it easy, Tori, no need to kill us. I don't believe this. I said he was too good to be true. It seems like it. I don't know if I'm more hurt or angry. Either way, I'm done, I'm done. It's just not worth it. Don't say that. You did nothing wrong. Why would somebody lie to my face? The mere thought just hurts too much. I really thought he was different. I know, Tori, I'm sorry. From now on, I'm just gonna concentrate on work. We have to stop the Adams. We cannot let them win. This time, it's personal. I'm kidding. Jeez. Using her to get information was genius. I fell for her. And I think I'm in love, Dad. Is he still trying to call? Do you need a hug? Come on, bring it in. Victoria Worthington? Thanks. Here, sign this. Thanks. Here. Wow, that's your favorite. Still no answer?

Just for a minute. Okay, yeah. Wait, wait, where are you going? Excuse me, miss, you can't go back there. Hey, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Victoria. I'm not speaking to you. I'm so sorry, sir, I tried to stop her. Oh, it's all right. What is it you want, cake fairy? Mr. Adams, you are a powerful man with resources at your disposal that I do not have. Fair enough. I know I can never win against you. And I can have a hundred more protests but at the end of the day, you're gonna tear down that bakery and you're gonna put up condos because you can. What is your point? Why are you here? Truthfully, I'm here because of him. Me? I've gotten to know your son, and I am so mad at him for lying to me, but I do think he is a good person, which means you must be a good person if you raised him. What did he tell you about me? He told me about your Nana, and her cakes. He told me about the joy they used to bring you, and how you lost your sweet tooth after she passed. Seems awful personal, young lady. I think it's incredibly sweet. And I made you something that I think sounds like it could be similar. So you're gonna bribe me with cake? No. No, not bribe. I didn't become a baker to get rich. I became one because it makes me happy. I give back to my community and I make people smile everyday and money cannot buy true happiness, Mr. Adams. I came here today to put a smile on your face. Please. Try my cake. No tricks. I'll show myself out. Are you gonna try it? What, you told her about Nana's cakes? Tori is an unbelievable woman. She is talented at what she does. Please try the cake. I'll get a fork. Oh! Dad? I can't believe it. Neither can I, Dad. Neither can I. Mm, mm. Mm. We're closed. Victoria, please, hear me out. Please. What are you doing here? Dropping off my notice to vacate in person? Tori, what you did changed everything. My father, he decided to reduce the number of units, which means you won. All the local shops are saved. - Wait, are you serious? - Yes. What you did reminded my father that there's more to life than just money. Jake, I was just trying to-- Where is that coming from? I thought I turned them off. Jake, what is this? This is different. Good different? Maybe. Hey, I... I screwed up, I know it. It doesn't excuse. Victoria, I am so sorry that I hurt you. You know, I'm just not used to being treated like a normal person, and you were so sweet, and kind, and I just didn't wanna blow it. Yeah, well, you sort of did. I know. I know and I regret it every day, more than you could ever know. I have never met anybody with the kind of passion that you have, and not just for work but for life. You make me wanna be the most amazing man that I could ever be. - You are-- - Hey, I miss you. I miss you so much. Please, please. Let me show you how much I mean that. Jake, I already think you're an amazing person. - Is that a yes? - You lied to me. I know. I know that I did, but I know that I couldn't bear the possibility that I might not be able to be close to you. It doesn't mean that I'm just gonna... Please. Please. Forgive me. Okay. - Really? - I forgive you. And, if you want me to be totally honest with you, I will. Yes, that's all I want. Victoria, I love you. Stop messing with the cake. - Just one last little tweak. - Okay. - Happy? - Oh, I love it. Okay, now go. You are already almost 15 minutes late. Oh, my cake. By the powers vested in me by the state of South Carolina, I pronounce you husband and wife. Who invited you? - I'm-- - Beat it. Okay.
