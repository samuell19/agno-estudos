You've brought out a pistol. How did you notice my finger? He saw through our ruse. Then what? ls this any way to scare someone? Should l make my finger resemble a cannon? He's going! Sir, listen!

Yes, that's why everyone's after it. 20 lakhs! - When will the car be repaired? - ln 10 minutes. - When it's done, call me. - As you say.

Why is he crying? Silence him! What's the matter? Can't you say it? Silence him first, or l'll strangle him! Have you gone mad? He must be crying due to hunger. The children won't cry anymore now. All our troubles will vanish now. See this coat? There's rupees 20 lakhs in it. 20 lakhs? Where did so much money come from? Whose coat is this? My boss's. l don't have to worry about my job anymore! Even if l work all my life, l couldn't earn this much! So you stole it? You threw away your job of so many years? Why should l work anymore? Now l'm a rich man myself! l curse such wealth, that's been robbed from others. Till now, you've ruined your life by gambling. Now, with stolen money... you want to ruin the lives of these innocent kids. - What are you saying? - lt's the truth. Till now, you've deceived me for the sake of money. Today, you deceived your employer. A person can do anything for money. l only gave up my job. Others might give up their honor, too. Our poverty is better than affluence without honor. Does this stolen money carry any honor? lf not for me, for the sake of these children... - go and return the coat. - That's not possible! l'm not such a fool to let money slip from my hands. - Open the door! - Who's there? - Police! What to do now? Go and return the coat! Open the door fast, or we'll break it down! Open it immediately, and don't try to escape! - What do you want? - After stealing the coat... you're asking what we want? Mr. Ganguly, what should be done with him? - Take him to the police station! - Come on! No! Please don't take him, constable. He's the sole bread earner of this house. Don't take him away! Take me in his place! He's the only support of my children and me! - But he's committed theft, and has to be punished. - Yes. Don't fall at my feet! - Why are you crying? - What else can l do? l can't bear to see a woman crying! - Let's go. - Where's the coat? We'll let him go only on one condition. - Give us the coat. - Yes. - You first. - Me? - Where's the coat? - Here it is. Come and sit. Latch the door. Turn on the light. - Where will we put it? - Let me have it. - There's a lot of money in it. - l know, so l'll keep it. But listen to me, you... You haven't got the money yet, but have already changed. Let me have it for just two minutes. lf a dead man is given clothes worth 20 lakhs... he'll come alive. And l'm a living man. - For just two just minutes. - Well? You won't get it! l won't get it? ls your head alright? Someone's knocking on the door. l thought l was making that sound. Who could this new trouble be? l'm coming. Welcome. Kishore, do you see who's there? - Two girls. - Two? l was seeing four. Greetings. Why greet them? Do you know them? Let's ask them first. Who are you? What are you saying? l never thought you'd change so much. So what's up? That's what l don't understand. - Trying to fool me? - l swear on God... l never saw them before in my life. Then why is that girl saying such things to you? That's the weird thing. Our elders said that trouble never arrives alone. Do you see? There are two of them there! Just watch. lt'll start with me, and end with you. Yes, what can l do for you? Sister, hasn't he turned a little thin? Can't you see? l'm turning healthy nowadays. That's why you didn't reply to our letter. And didn't come to the station to receive us. l have a lot to complain about. Certainly, but you've come to the wrong address. Read it again. l never thought that you'd forget me so soon. While in Poona, you used to bring me home from college every day. - But now... - Wait. - Forget Poona. Where do l drop you now? - Nowhere. What do we have to lose? Let them stay here. Women always arrive after the money does. lf you wish that, then what can l do? She's all right, but why is that girl sad? She's eyeing you! Both you and l have some sort of sorrow Love without any fear. Who knows about tomorrow? l'm afraid! Sorrow is a reality here, and happiness a lie Raise your eyes. This is such a delightful night Fill your heart with love at the very first sight Love without any fear. Who knows about tomorrow? l'm afraid! l don't know the meaning of happiness or love Why should you go far? Love accommodates life Fill your heart with love at the very first sight Love without any fear. Who knows about tomorrow? l'm afraid! Hold me, someone. Don't let me overflow with sorrow This night is blessed. Join your heart with mine Fill your heart with love at the very first sight Love without any fear. Who knows about tomorrow? l'm afraid! My heart knows no happiness Love lies in the exchange of hearts Fill your heart with love at the very first sight Love without any fear. Who knows about tomorrow? Both you and l have some sort of sorrow Love without any fear. Who knows about tomorrow? We are afraid! l'm feeling sleepy. She's feeling sleepy. - You too? - Yes, l'm feeling sleepy too. Sister, get up. - What is it? - Go and find where they've put the coat. - They're awake. - Try at least. Watch out! There's rupees 20 lakhs in the coat! lf anyone touches it, l'll murder him! Why are you trying to strangle me? - l was dreaming. - Dreaming? l'm sleeping lightly. Where's the coat? ls it safe? Be careful about it. - Where's the coat? - Beneath my head. Here it is. The coat's gone! You lousy fool! You're responsible for this! - What happened? - Something's certainly happened... but l don't know what it was. l'm trying to find out. Out of gas. The car won't move. - Never mind. - What are you doing? lt can't go forward, so l'm trying to drive backwards. lf it can go in reverse, it can go forward too. You're right. What should we do now? Push it hard. l've paid what l had to. l can't pay any more now. Why not? Do you want to keep 20 lakhs all to yourself? - Hand me 25%. - You mean, 5 lakhs? - Yes. - What's the matter, uncle? - Nothing! Bihari, take the coat. Beware! lf you want the coat, come with 5 lakhs to the place... where you paid me money before! Let's go! - You? - Yes, me. Are you scared? - What's there to be scared of? - Stop! - l've come for my share. - You've already got it. - Get out of my sight! - Veer Singh! l know your machinations very well! l risked my life for the coat. Will you enjoy the spoils alone? Why feel bad? Everyone's destiny is different. l've come to change my destiny today. lf you want to live, give me half the share! l see. Bihari, he wants half the money. - Very well. - Watch out! Hand over the coat quietly, or you'll suffer. Give it! l think l'll have to remain here till the police arrive. Go and bring 5,000 rupees from the safe. You come with me. Give it. - Do you remember the car no? - Certainly. - What is it? - 24-12-BMU - That's our license number. - What about the girls' car? lt was 2 this side, 5 on the other, and... l forgot it. Let's do something: We'll get it from the telephone directory. Can you find license numbers in the telephone directory? - l made a mistake. - Boring me for nothing! Bhaggu, look. lt's the same car! - lt's not that car. - lt is! - That's Smriti and Shashi's car. - We're chasing them. - Why are we chasing them? - Because they have the coat! - What? The coat? - Yes! Hurry up! Shall we just stand and do nothing? You fool, nobody offers support in trouble. - Uncle has sent me. - That's great! He's asked you to hand over the coat to me. ln return, he has sent 5,000 rupees. - Five thousand? - Yes, here it is. - Where is the coat? - lt's lying over there. - Where is it? - Out there. - What is it? - l heard the coat is quite valuable. - Just 5,000 won't do. - What? - But uncle said just that. - What does he know? - Tell uncle whatever you want. - Why should l? Help! - You duped us and ran away! - Where's the other one? Up there. She must be in trouble. Please help her. Help! Who's there? - So it's you? - Yes! Why are you here? - The helpless woman's cries brought us here. - Well? - Then hear the sound of this too. - Okay. Hey mister! The woman's cries made us come upstairs... but, hearing your sounds, we're going downstairs. - Then go! - We're going! - Shame on you! - Why? Abandoning a girl in distress, you're running away? Don't you feel ashamed? - What do you say? - l don't like fighting. - My limbs are aching. - She's calling us shameless. - What do you say? - l do feel shame. - Then advance. - You advance first. Shall l? Okay. - Will you leave or not? - We won't. - You won't? - No. Stop! - What do you say? - Let's start! Uncle, something astounding happened. What happened? Did you get the coat? That man turned out to be a scoundrel. Hearing our screams, if these two men hadn't showed up... then, in lieu of the coat, we may have been killed... and we would have been tainted forever. Yes, uncle, these two men are most upright. - Upright men? - That's right. l think l have... Seen us before? You're right. l, too, have seen you before, but l can't remember. - What do you say? - Shut up! Sorry, sir, at that time our situation was bad. - But now, it's a bit warm. - We're sweating now. Yes, uncle, they helped us a lot in procuring the coat. l understand. Their very faces reveal their uprightness. We're nothing. lt's your kindness to consider us upright. - Where's the coat? - Give the coat. Here it is. We acquired it with difficulty. lt's the wrong coat. No, uncle, this is the same coat. No dear. l've risked my life for that coat. Wouldn't l recognize it? This is a different coat. You're examining it quickly. Do it slowly. Put on proper glasses. These are the right glasses. l've examined it lt's not the same coat. l'm sorry. You've certainly helped me... but l couldn't get what l wanted. But you've saved the lives of my nieces, so l thank you. l'll do for you whatever l can. When we couldn't get the right coat, what can we do? - Let's go, Bhaggu. - Right. Why do you want to carry that useless coat? Throw it away. Throw it away? l'll use it to polish my boots and scrub the floor. l'll burn it to light my stove. lt's robbed us of our sleep and digestion. - Why will l throw it away? Let's go. - Come on. - That is the same coat. - Why did you lie then? l had to. Two men know about it, and give us much trouble. lf they know, too, they'll also trouble us. But they aren't like that. l know they're good men. But let me, too, put them to the test. Like you, if l find them upright, too... then what can give us greater happiness? Go and first get the coat from them somehow. After stealing my heart... you're about to leave me After making me feel you love me... you're about to break my heart and leave Where are you going, after stealing my heart? My beloved, you've entered my heart l don't trust you or your love at all Where are you going, after stealing my heart? My love, l entreat you. Please don't go away Your departure will make me die My beloved, you've entered my heart l don't trust you or your love at all Don't make false promises to me Don't harass me, let me go You invited me to your house, then threw me out Where are you going, after stealing my heart?

Hoping to get the coat back. - What can l do if l can't find it? - That means... lt will be found. Nothing is impossible to find. What's the use of getting it back after 50 years? Had l found it now... That means you don't want to stay here? l want to. But it should benefit. Effort never goes to waste. lf you have sympathy for us... the result will be good. Stay here, try you best. You'll surely find the coat. Shashi, show him to his room. What about me? You also come along. - You can stay here. - l see. - Like it? - Wow! And look, if you need anything... ring this bell. The servant will be at your service. - Excuse me! - Yes? - Nothing. - Tell me. - Nothing. - Hey buddy!

Dhondu, you get that table. Get the table and that stand too. Get the easy chair. Don't forget that. Where's the bed? lt must be in the bedroom. Go and get it. Don't forget the table lamp. You go and help him. Be careful. Sir, two people are sleeping on the bed. What else would be sleeping there? Animals? - But where did they come from? - l don't know. - Take me there. - Come. Be careful. Don't damage anything. Hey mister! Hello! Hey gentlemen, wake up! They're sleeping so late. - What's the matter? - Nothing. l have to move the furniture. Kishore, wake up. They want to move the furniture. - Move the furniture? - Yes. - Who are you? - Who let you in? - The door was open. - First tell me who are you? - Who are we? We're master's sons-in-law. He didn't get it. Son-in-law means daughter's husband. l know. Listen, your father-in-law sold this and left for good. - Where did he go? - He didn't leave his address. Now do me a favor. Please leave. - Well... - No excuses, please leave. Pandhu, move the furniture. - Buddy, they went away. - But why? - That's what... They also took our clothes. And the coat too. lf they wanted to go, why'd they take that worthless coat? Buddy... What trouble is this? - Who is she calling? - l don't know. lf you don't know, how will l? l'll try to find out. Madam... What an escape! She's calling you. Yes? Sir, madam has left this note for you. She asked me to give it to you when you woke up.

So we came by train. Muthu, take the luggage inside. Please come inside. Buddy, this is a big problem. What do we do now? Now that we've come here, we have to do something.

What can l do all alone? Don't you get paid for it? You have to do it. Do it if you like. Or you may leave. lf l leave, then who will do this work? Madam, we're looking for work. Can we get work? The servants are ready. Look. What do you say? Leave if you want to. This is what l get for my service? Now God will see to it. You've rendered me jobless! - Will you be happy? - Get lost!

You helped me to understand. l was about to commit a sin. - You saved me. - What are you doing?

Understand, dear? l understand. Since that coat has been in this house... we lost a servant. Mother sent a cable that she's unwell. This coat is jinxed. That's right. Two witches, a demon, and fifteen others want to get it. Dear, burn it or tear it. But don't keep it in this house. And if you're unable to do that, give that coat to me. l'll turn it to ashes. You've done a great job. - Here. ls this the one? - Yes, this is the one. Close your eyes. l'll show you the magic of this coat. You've done a great job. lt was difficult getting this coat back. l didn't do anything, uncle. lt was all Bhaggu's idea. Bhaggu? But where is he? - Downstairs. He's coming in his real form. - l see! - What's up? - l was changing. - You? - Yes, it's me. That was a nice disguise. Everyone is praising you. Empty praise is of no use. lf anybody praises me sincerely, l can do ... anything. Really? So you haven't found anyone like that? l regret that for whom we are doing all this, is unaware of it. - Do you have any problem? - Yes. Your eyes pierced my heart This is the saga of our love Hearing your name, l went crazy You've been in my heart for a long time When our eyes met, my heart blossomed When l met you, my heart had no complaints My heart sighed Your eyes pierced my heart l'm not in my senses What spell have you cast?

Your love is all l have Hearing your name, l went crazy Your eyes pierced my heart What is this? You act so well. Why don't you say this to uncle? - lf l ask uncle, you know what he'll say? - What? Get lost! Wants to marry her, indeed! You dream so high. l'll never allow you to marry my child. Get out of my house. l say it in English. He'll say this. Uncle! Please get the doctor. - Where are you going? - To get the doctor. - Why? Uncle is breathing his last, l'm going for the doctor. Let's go. Leave me! Let me die. - Why did you save me? - What were you doing, uncle? l don't want to see this disgrace with my own eyes. - What disgrace? - What disgrace! After brother's death, l brought you up like my own daughter. l looked after you like a father. And this is what l get in return? One sings songs with someone. One chats with the other. lt's better to die than witness this. But you promised them, uncle. They brought the coat back, risking their lives. Now it's your turn to keep your promise. My promise is not greater than your welfare. Had l not lured them, they wouldn't have returned... that coat which was in their custody. Earlier, too, you fraudulently brought them to Madras. lf they hadn't cared for us, and only wanted the coat... why travel to Madras from Bombay? So now you consider me a fraud? lsn't that enough humiliation? l faced so many problems for your sake. And you think l'm a fraud? Anyway. l just wanted to keep you away from those loafers. lf you think l'm greedy for your wealth... then here's your coat. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! What are you doing? - Let me die. - We don't have anyone except you. Who else can think of our welfare better than you? lf they really love you, they will trace you. Only then l'll agree that they don't love your wealth... but truly love you. Then l'll agree to whatever you say. So what are we supposed to do, uncle? - Pack your things quickly. - Okay. Let's go. Please come. Kishore, uncle is gone! What are you saying? Can't you see, he's covered with a sheet? He could go if he wanted to. We wouldn't stop him. But he should have at least fulfilled his promise. Kishore, he is gone! Wait, don't be afraid. Let me examine the patient. Now what's the use, doctor? Now that he's dead... What nonsense is this! Pillows! - What's this? - l got it. Uncle has deceived us for the third time. Anyway, never mind. Doctor, since the patient is missing, why should we pay you? We, like fools, brought you here. Here's your fee. Rs. 10. Can you manage with half? Alright? l saved Rs. 5. - What is it? - l think they are Shashi and Smriti. How can Shashi and Smriti come here? They're preparing to go overseas. - Overseas? - Yes, they're going by plane. - How do you know? - l inquired at the airport. - What do we do now? - Follow them. Excellent performance! This is your reward. Escort our guests to the royal guest room. Please come. Wait. Can you tell us where the royal guest room is? - Why? - We want to meet our new guests. You can't meet them. - Why? - Aren't we allowed to go to the royal guest room? You can't go to the place where they are at the moment. - What do you mean? - Where are they now? ln prison. Sir, l think you're mistaken. Mr. Mallick had asked you to take us to the guest room. But you brought us to the prison. You're fortunate. Very strange. What's going on? All those who please Mr. Mallick are sent here. lf that's the case then please tell him... that we don't approve of this place. Where are you going? You'll be killed if you try to escape. Lock them in. Uncle, what have you done? Why? What happened? Why did you send them to the jail? Jail? How do you know that? Uncle, please don't try to hide anything from us. You're being unjust to them. You know nothing. At times we are forced to do such things. But this is unfair. They risked their lives to save us... and you've put them in the dungeon? But all this is for your benefit. You just don't know that people are just after our money. But Kishore and Bhaggu aren't like that. They're very decent. That's not to be judged by one's face. How are we to know their intentions? l'm sure they're innocent. l've seen more of this world, child. But this time you're mistaken. Yes, allow us to make our own decisions. But l'm still alive. As long as l'm alive l won't let you do that. We've gone through a lot because of that. We've always trusted you. But you never let us have peace of mind. ls that the way you think of me? Am l not responsible for your safety. We'll take care of ourselves. lf we're destined to be disappointed... then so be it. But you can't deceive us now. Silence. Take them to their room. And keep an eye on them. Uncle. Whisky, brandy or something else? Buddy, he'll land us in trouble. - Listen... - Be polite to him. - Your... - Majesty... - Majesty. - My dear... - Sir... - Sir. - Honorable... - Sire... - Sire. We do not drink. We would rather prefer some soft drinks. - Soft drink? And you? - Even l'll drink. Both of you? Then l'll serve you the royal drink. - Did you understand? - No. - And you? l'll bring the royal drink for you. Now l understand. Buddy, l think he's mad. - What are you saying? - Didn't you hear what he said? He said... What's going to happen now? Here's your drink. A single sip... and you'll be in the heavens! Here's your glass. Take it. This is for you. Drink it. Wait! l forgot the ice. You are making it chilled? Now you can have it. Buddy, we are in such a mess. Drink it soon or you'll annoy him. l'll not drink it. You're drinking it? ls it really good? Did you like the drink? lt was excellent. What to say? lt's mindblowing! Okay tell me, are you interested in music? He's talking about song and dance. Of course, but we're helpless. We don't have the instruments. Oh no, there's no such thing as helplessness. in this heaven of ours. You can get anything you want. Do you want the instruments? Yes. You can bring any instrument you want. - What do you say? - Yes, of course. You take this and this is for you. lt seems like a fantasy. Let's start. This one seems to be a tabla. Now you try it. Kishore, l think there's some magic in it. l can't see anything, but l can play the instruments. - Shall we play? - Yes. - Ready? One... - Two... Now l really feel that we're in the heaven. You're great Mr. Mallick. How dare you mention the name of that cheat? - Who took his name? - He did. - l took his name. - Did you? - Yes. Why are you strangling me? l just took his name. l won't spare you! Silence! Okay. Buddy, it's rather strange! Strange. Uncle is rather smart. He was with us a few moments ago... and now he's here? From where have you come? Uncle, you know everything. l know everything. Who else but you will know everything? You made us roam all around the world. From Mumbai to Madras, Madras to Calcutta. And finally we reached here. You even gave us false promises. That means even you were deceived by that cheat! A person who could deceive his own brother... can't he deceive others? But we didn't get you. This is a case of mistaken identity. l'm not Jwalaprasad. l'm his younger brother, Badriprasad. Okay. But spare me a moment, sir. Could you please tell us how many of you there are? So that things would be easier for us. We had one more brother. Hanuman Prasad. But Jwala Prasad had him killed. - Really? - Yes. But he had two daughters. l wonder where they are now. - Two girls? Buddy. - Yes. - Perhaps its Shashi or Smriti. Yes, you're right. How do you know them? Where did you meet them? Please tell me. They are my late brother's daughters. Don't worry. Both of them are here with Jwalaprasad. - ls Jwalaprasad here? - Yes. Let him come. But he won't get anything. The coat for which he desperately searches... has nothing in it. How is this possible? l learned two things. lt was clearly mentioned in that letter that half the map... to our secret treasure trove is in this coat... and the other half is with you. But unless we get the other half, we are helpless. l suspect your younger brother. Please don't lose heart, Mr. Mallick. l'm sure that we'll find the map. - Sir? - What is it? - The prisoners escaped. - Escaped? - Yes sir. Even our guests escaped. That's bad news. Buddy, the door closed on its own. What now? This isn't a palace. This is a haunted house. This is the other guest house. What's happening? - Buddy, did you hear that? - Yes. - What did he say? Perhaps they're ordering refreshments for us. Why is he looking up? Buddy, is this what you call refreshments? Perhaps they'll entertain us on a swing. Swing for us? lt's the noose. We'll die swinging! - Kishore, he's calling you. - No, he's calling you. Which one of us do you want? Think about it. Don't do this. Who? Me? Kishore, my days are numbered. lt's destiny. ls this my destiny? lt's being forced on me. How can l accept this? Anyway, there's nothing l can do. l'm your friend. l'll have to die for you. Buddy, this is an unexpected death. - There's a chance of rebirth, right? - Right. ln case we're born again... please don't be my friend. Buddy, l have the same request of you. That's even better. Good bye. Go my dear friend. Die a peaceful death. Great, my friend, who's so concerned about me. - Bhaggu... - Kishore... - You're leaving me alone. - Yes, l'm going You're bidding adieu to this world l'm leaving this world of deception There's no reason to be alive Though no fault of mine, l've been punished Strange are the ways of life For friendship, l can even sacrifice my life Buddy, it's time to bid adieu. May god be with you What's a life full of fear? He's no man, if he's afraid of death No one is immortal You are brave. Die a martyr's death Death has come uninvited, through no fault of mine A martyr l'll become today l, too, will lose a good friend like you Your turn will soon come, buddy There you are right, my friend You be the leader l'll be right behind you Oh, so you almost managed to escape from here too? Let the fat one be the first to die. - Buddy. - Yes. - There's no escape now. Even Mr. Mallick is here. - Kishore... - Yes. Hurry up. Mr. Mallick. Mallick! Who called out to that cheat? Where is he? Where is that cheat? You scoundrel! Where is Mallick? Mr. Mallick, there he is. - What are you staring at? - You took his name? Buddy, what will happen now? Buddy, l think our death is near. Before that do something or you'll regret it. - What should l do? - Let's start. - Catch him. Where is he? - There he is. Stop. You sit down. Come on. - Hurry up. - Catch him. Don't let him escape. He's gone too. Let's go! Kill both of them. Arrest them. Stop! Beware! - Come on, fatso. - He's the man... who kept us in the dungeon for four years. And he murdered his own brother. Jwalaprasad made their lives a hell. Arrest them! We were in search of them too. Actually we even got... a summons from lndia to arrest them. You're under arrest. Take them. Mr. Badriprasad, l've not deceived you. On the contrary, l was helpless. But now's the right time... to return this to you. Here's the other half of the map. Map? What are you saying? You know very well that without this... you'll never be able to reach the hidden treasure. You're right. And this map is a testimony to my innocence. Mr. Mallick! Keep this. This belongs to you. No Uncle, we just want to be with them. You both? You are here again. - Where's your uncle? - ln police custody. What? Then what are you doing here? Another conspiracy against us? No, there's nothing like that. What are you saying? Great! Hey mister, this is your world Explore the secret of happiness. The world is a mystery Devoid of compassion is this world. So selfish is this world But, hey mister, remember it's still not without love - Listen to me, buddy. - Tell me, pal lf you have the passion... this world is yours, remember that Hey Kishu, this world is yours Hey Bhaggu, this world is yours Why worry, my friend?
