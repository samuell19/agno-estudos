ECHIPA 2021 Extracted by balloumowgly Did you put the seal on the entire consignment? Yes, sir. Tomorrow, the consignment shall reach its destination and the payments will be transferred into the offshore accounts. Well done. We are close to our goal as well as victory. You too shall be remembered for destroying India's armies and freeing Kashmir. India will pay for one mujahid's life with a thousand soldiers. We'll show them real bloodshed! Now, India will know what a real war is! I want these men alive. I want to send them back to India in pieces! What's the status? IEDs are planted everywhere, ma'am. It's a death trap. Override it. Override complete. Sir, we need back-up now! ND-1 has been compromised! Come forth or be prepared to die! In three... Two! - Bhim, move now! One! "Bhim stands tall like a mountain!" "He is impossible to move." "His enemies are sure to let out an anguished cry!" "He will rip you apart!" "And cut off the head of the enemy." "Wound him with as many arrows and bullets," "but this soldier's valour shines through." "When this lion lets out a fierce roar" "and enters the battlefield," "he will leave a pile of bodies behind." "And the vultures shall circle the skies." "Proclaim victory! The battlefield is empty." "I am mighty. I can keep going on." "I give out a strong message. It leaves everyone in shock." "I take them out one by one like the devil." "I show no mercy. I snap necks." "I rip the heads off the bodies." "Dark clouds shroud the battlefield as I move forward!" "The ramifications of messing with me are dire." "Wait until I wield my weapon." "This Pandava alone killed many of the Kauravas!" "The ramifications of messing with me are dire." "Wait until I wield my weapon." "This Pandava alone killed many of the Kauravas!" "O Duryodhana, prepare for battle. Let's see you thwart my attack." "You can bring an entire army, but they are no match for me." "I can sense the fear in your eyes. I'll defeat you and be victorious." "Bhim alone is enough to take down all your troops!" Scoundrel! Do you think that you can kill us? We are neither a people nor a creed. We are a mindset that cannot be erased. We will erase this mindset for good. No one will ever dare to think of it again! We are India. We will not waste time talking. We will break you! Now. Charlie, come in. How long? Alpha, seven minutes out. Roger that. - Oh! And, Alpha, if you were late by even one minute, then Arjun... Arjun would have probably got the Ashoka Chakra which he might never get now. Sorry, Arjun. - Your arrogance is your biggest foe. And my confidence is my greatest friend. That's how I could set a record, ma'am. Watch out, Alpha. It doesn't take time for victory to turn into defeat. How many minutes? What was that sound? Bravo, what's happening? What are you doing, sir? The child's a suicide bomber! She's a child, and she's petrified. What's going on? Get me the bomb experts now! Call the bomb disposal expert now. Sir, only seven minutes until the bomb explodes! We have only six minutes to save her. Do you have parents? I don't either. Just wait another minute. Then we'll leave. I promise. Sir, how many minutes left? Three minutes! - Sir, there must be red, blue and green wires. There's just red, blue and yellow. What's the problem? Ma'am, normally, these bombs have red, blue and green wires. They seem to have interchanged the wires. I can't do anything. I'm sorry. Tell me quickly! Tell me quickly! There's under a minute left. Tell me! Bhim! You and your team must leave right away! No way! I cannot leave her! Don't do something you will regret for the rest of your life. Ma'am, we lost connection. It's got to be either green or yellow. Guys, move it now! Ma'am, we've established connection. 'Three Years Later' 'Adjara, Georgia' 'Shining on Earth...' '5500 spectators in the stadium.' 'Kallis coming from the end...' 'Kallis is doing his typical run up' 'and seems to be pulling a good line of length.' 'That's probably the shot from Sachin.' 'Lovely shot.' 'The ball sails through the air.' 'It's headed straight for the boundary.' 'John in hard pursuit.' 'And it's fallen straight down the fielder's throat.' 'Oh my God! Who would have seen that...' 'Oh my God! Who would have seen that coming?' 'The grade doesn't vary, I'm still...' Vinod! Quick! Get the first aid kit! You're okay, dear. Give me the bandage. Quick. You'll be fine, dear. Nothing will happen to you. God! - The bleeding won't stop. We have to take Mimi to the hospital. You know what will happen if we take her to the hospital! And she will die if we don't! We can't take the risk. Vinod! Her blood type is impossible to get! Message them. I am sure they will do something. Hurry! Okay. 'Indian Observation Station' Find out where the alert is coming from, and don't lose it! You! Call Rajput and Bhatnagar here right now. Hurry up! Who? Chief Assistant, National Security Agency. Nandini Rajput. And secretary to the Principal Secretary of India, Abhay Bhatnagar. Call them right now! The alert has come from a bouncing server. Find the link for the second bounce. Hurry! Report. Sir, we spotted an alert for Rh null blood group 45 minutes ago. Hmm. - It originated from a secure server as a coded message. It first originated from Armenia and bounced off Brazil. And then Indonesia. After that... - From there to Israel, and Israel to India. Then Pakistan. And lastly, Alvernia. He could be anywhere in the world! Tell me the timing of the original alert. Yes, ma'am. Triangulate it. What are we even doing? We're trying to locate Banerjee, and we've found him. So, he's in... Adjara. Ma'am! Look. This town Ochkhamuri has a population of 5000 people. It has just one hospital. This is what I found from the camera footage on overriding the servers. Only one person has been admitted to the hospital with a head injury, and that's this girl, Mimi. We need to see the Principal Secretary right away. Sir! Jai Hind, sir. Please sit. Sir, sorry to disturb you... - Sir... We've located a way to get to Dr Banerjee. What! - Yes, sir. We intercepted a coded message sent out by a small hospital in Adjara of an urgent requirement for Rh null blood group for a six-year-old girl. Only 25 people in the world have the golden blood group. We have their records barring this girl's. Yes, sir. Records show that Dr Banerjee had a daughter. A girl with blood group Rh null was born in Slovenia six years ago. By the time our agents arrived at the scene, the mother and daughter had fled from the hospital. This is our biggest breakthrough in this case to date. We want that girl. What? What's the problem? Actually, sir, this message bounced off five countries before we received it. What do you mean? - Sir, it means those five countries received the message before us. And I am sure they are planning to do the same as us. Nandini, how soon can you put together a team? Sir... - Excuse me, sir! This is a highly classified and dangerous mission. We can't just up and send a team there. I need to consult with the army chief. And it'd take at least ten days to put a team of highly-trained specialists just for this mission! Sir, I can put together a mission-ready team in 48 hours. Oh, really? And how will you do that? Would you mind explaining? Sir, NERO. National Emergency Response Operatives. It's RAW, Defence and NSA's highly-covert programme. The soldiers of the special forces are tested on their skills and nationalism, sir. Elaborate. Sir, they are tested using extreme pressure tactics. If one lacks love for his country, then within minutes, they turn from patriots to traitors. And how do you know these people? It is because I had suspended them, sir. Some directly, and the others indirectly. What's the success rate? 100 percent, sir. Sir, let me remind you that this is a high-risk mission. We don't have time to experiment! Correct, Bhatnagar. We don't have time either. Sir, I strongly object to this! This is sheer madness! I... I'm sorry... Nandini, put a squad together. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Nandini! Why didn't you tell me about NERO? I didn't feel the need to. - What! But there's one thing I do find the need to tell you. If you hold my hand against my will ever again, you will lose your hand and your life too. Got it? Got it? - Ouch! Got it? - Yes. How is she now, doctor? The bleeding has stopped. There is no trauma, and she doesn't need blood. She's healing very fast. We've never seen anything like this. Can we take her home? Not yet. We have to do some more tests. Okay, doctor. Thank you so much. - Welcome. 'Ukraine, Donetsk' Target in sight, sir. 'Aria, you get only one chance.' Traitor! 'If you fail this mission,' 'you have no chance of returning here.' I have faith in you, sir. Don't let me down. - 'Aria, you have only a few seconds.' I don't need a few seconds. I need just one second. Entered via blood as a pretext! Bye-bye, Vladimir. 'Whenever you're ready to come in, we'll be waiting.' "She'll burn you to the ground! You'll turn to ash." "You cannot win against her. You will lose!" "You will lose!" "She shoots with precision. She never misses the target." "She shoots with precision. She never misses the target." Mission accomplished, sir. 'Well done, Aria.' 'I'll try my best to get you back on active duty.' I did my job. You need to do yours. Whether he does it or not, I certainly will. Who are you? I am the reason for all your problems as well as their solution. I don't speak to strangers. Before I shut you up for good, you better start talking! Sorry, ma'am. - Skip the apologies. Will you come work for me? Hello? - 'Where's the girl?' Adjara, Georgia. But there's a problem. Five other countries know her location as well. 'Worry about the Indian mission. We'll deal with the rest.' There's one more problem. Rajput and the National Security Advisor are working on a highly-covert programme which I have no idea of. I tried my best but... Hello? Hello? Hello, connect me to Mr Singh, please. 'Chisinau' I don't know when I'll get the chance to fire you. Please don't be upset. Don't ever leave me. For the sake of my love! If you're done romancing, can we talk business? You didn't tell me your name, and you wish to talk business! Why? Don't you talk to strangers? I don't. Will you talk to me, Romeo? Ma'am, what a surprise! I have a job for you. I accept the job, ma'am. Good. Let's go. The chance to fire you is here! 'You both go to Riga to recruit Addy.' 'Wait for further instructions.' Hey! Are you scared? Don't worry. I'll keep you safe. Come on! Take her down! Come on! Go, man! Come on! Take her down! Wow! That's impressive. How many have you knocked out so far? All those who challenged me. I lost count after 100. Who wants to know? Who else do you see other than me? I don't see them, but I can hear them. Nandini Rajput wants to see you. Ask her to come here. I'm not her bitch that I'd go to her wagging my tail! If you don't come with me, I don't know about anyone else, but I'll make you my bitch! 'Addy, there's a job for you.' 'I don't have the time to brief you about it.' No way I'd refuse a chance to serve the country! 'Good. I'm sending you co-ordinates.' 'Where are you, ma'am?' Minsk. I'm handling a situation. See you soon. Oh! Miss Rajput! Government of India at your service. Tell me. What's going on, Bhatnagar? You know, the usual. Drinks and music. I am not asking about drinks and nibbles! Tell me why Amit Dixit is sitting before me. Well, you see, our Mr A K Singh doesn't have any faith in your experiment. So, he has sent one of his trusted soldiers. I do not like surprises! And I don't like secrets! Get it? Keep that in mind. Please excuse me now. The ice is melting. Good night. Keep two things in mind. This is my mission, not Bhatnagar's. So, you will report to me. - Yes, ma'am. And only to me. I've received new coordinates. Vinod, let's go home. Are you mad? It's not safe! We cannot leave the documents there! But... Are we moving houses again? Dear, we're doing it for your safety. Had you listened to your mother and avoided getting into this accident, we wouldn't have had to do it. I know you are not my parents. Why don't you tell me who I am? You'll know when the time is right. 'You'll know when the time is right.' This is what you say every time. I... I promise I will tell you everything when the time comes. Okay? I left my old life behind three years ago. I'm getting sloshed! Is this seat free? So, what are you celebrating? Do people only drink when they're happy? Okay. So, then... Why are you drowning your sorrows? It's a long story. So is the night. Tell me your story. Leave it. - Come on. This is the plus point of talking to strangers. You can open up to them. You know, without being judged. Besides, I can't take this music anymore! What kind of music do you like? One that sounds foreign and is stylish. But is hardcore Indian at the same time. But these morons will sing what they want and play the music of their choice. What if I grant your wish? Then you'll be in... for a shocking surprise yourself! "I want to be lost in your thoughts all the time." "I am intrigued by your questions." "My love is only for you." "I am intoxicated in your love." "I am intoxicated in your love." "Don't let me come to my senses." "I am intoxicated in your love." "I am intoxicated in your love." "Don't let me come to my senses." "I want time to come to a standstill." "I want time to come to a standstill." "I want to be a part of your dreams." "You are captivated by my beauty." "I will steal your heart." "My love is only for you." "I am intoxicated in your love." "I am intoxicated in your love." "Don't let me come to my senses." "I am intoxicated in your love." "I am intoxicated in your love." "Don't let me come to my senses." Looks like the surprise is going to be special. Yes, it's very special. Didn't I tell you that my surprise would shock you? You don't seem as stupid as you really are. And you're not as smart as you come across. How are you, buddy? You left without saying goodbye. Whatever the assignment is, I'm sorry. I cannot help you. I'm not here to ask for your help, but to help you. You need atonement, and I can give that to you. It has been three years since, ma'am. You don't know me now, nor do you need me. Goodbye. She wasn't done talking. But I am. You're a champion at ending discussions and children's lives! I can break your jaw effortlessly. I love things that have been ripped apart. Amit, that's enough. Everyone, out. Look, Bhim. She's an innocent six-year-old girl. She's coveted by governments around the world. She has no idea how important she is. If someone else gets to her before we do, you cannot imagine what will happen to her. Who is she? She's India's daughter. You don't need a better reason. I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't help you. You know what? So am I. You were right. I don't know you. The Bhim I knew would never refuse to help his country and one of its daughters! That Bhim died three years ago in Kashmir. You're weighed down by guilt for the Kashmir mishap to this day! That's why you are so lonely. You'll never move on unless you atone for it! Life is giving you a chance. Don't let it slip. 'Save... Save me.' Oops! I'm sorry, sir. - Idiot! Can't you see? - Sorry, sir. Who's in charge here? I am, Girish Malik. I am in charge of this offsite. - Of course! No wonder everything about this place is off! Actually, sir, we weren't expecting you this early. How was your flight, sir? Long and exhausting. Organise a massage for me. Excuse me? Massage? Is Rajput and her squad here? Sir. Sir, please have a seat. Mr Bhatnagar! I'm glad you could join us. Mr Singh wanted me to come here and be a part of your briefing. I hope you don't have a problem. - No problem. As long as you don't create problems for me, it's no problem. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NERO. You all know me. Let me introduce him. He's Mr Abhay Bhatnagar, Secretary to the Principal Secretary. All of you must be curious as to why you're here. This is why. This girl is Mimi Banerjee. She's in Adjara, Georgia, as we speak, and your mission is to bring her to us safe and sound. You told us her name but not why she's important. Mimi Banerjee is the granddaughter of India's renowned scientist, Dr Banerjee. Dr Banerjee? Dr Banerjee was the founding member of DRDO. He dreamt of making India a superpower before Russia and America. He needed superhumans to achieve that which he created. What do you mean? Half-human, half-android. Genetically modified super soldiers who could go without food and water and continuously fight against the enemy. Suffice to say that one cyborg could replace 1000 human beings. Cyborgs. Are you insinuating that he tried to make cyborgs? Not only did he try, he even succeeded. Once, we received information that Naxalites had planned a meeting in one of the villages. As an experiment, we sent a team of cyborgs to fight the Naxals. During that encounter, along with the Naxals, the cyborgs destroyed the entire village. You see, cyborgs couldn't differentiate between good and evil. Sadly, around 4000 villagers, including women and children, perished. What became of the cyborgs? When Banerjee realised that he had created supervillains instead of superhumans, he shut down all the cyborgs and fled India along with the blueprints. What happens if these prints fall into the wrong hands? 10 cyborgs took down 4000 people in one hour. Imagine there were 1000 cyborgs. The world would witness an imbalance of power. Who else has this information? A lot of people do. It's going to be a battle. You must leave immediately. Girish, you will go with them. Ma'am, I'm not a field agent. You want to spend all your life cooped up here? Everyone, let's get ready. See you in Delhi. I'm coming with you. Not my arm, hold the jacket. All clear. - The house is empty. Copy. Let's go. Base, come in. - Base here. Bravo One, I have two stills. Did you get the package? No, we didn't. I have two stills. The package isn't here. Bhim, we need to find the package at all costs. Yes, ma'am. Whoever abducted Mimi were pros. They've fried the circuits. What do we do now? Not pro enough! Get to work. - Yes, boss. Amit, fetch the memory card from the CCTV camera outside. I don't take orders from you. This isn't the time. Come on. Girish, refine the image. Not possible. The camera produces low-resolution images. But we don't have a choice. You heard the quality is low. It's impossible. I've identified them. It's the Pakistani Special Forces. How do you know? The gun he is holding is SMG PK-1 and it is manufactured only in Pakistan. And it is used only by the Pakistani army. Good job. When's the footage from? An hour ago. Base, come in. Did any planes or choppers take off from here in the last hour? Negative. The entire area is a no-fly zone. It means it's here. Who is here? - The package. Trace the car. Found it. We've traced the location. - Good. Let's move. Sir, can you hear me? Yes, sir. But we need to leave from here. Look, hand over the girl to us and live the rest of your life happily. You darned Indians never... We never repeat ourselves! "He never turns his back. Bhim faces danger head-on!" "We are resolute and confident that we'll rip our enemies apart!" "We never give up. We've tasted countless victories." "We will fight until our last breath!" "We are Indians! Yes, we're Indians!" "I am a bad influence and a harsh lesson!" "I can take you down in the blink of an eye." "If you intend on attacking my country," "I will beat the living tar out of you!" "I stand tall as a mountain! My country is my life." "If you do something unacceptable," "I'll send you packing, my friend!" Come at me! - "All my enemies and foes" "wait patiently for the day I'll die." "They wait patiently for the day I'll die." "He never turns his back. Bhim faces danger head-on!" "We are resolute and confident that we'll rip our enemies apart!" "We never give up. We've tasted countless victories." "We will fight until our last breath!" "We are Indians! Yes, we're Indians!" "We are Indians! Yes, we're Indians!" "We fear no mortal, for we stand united." "This might be your turf, but victory shall belong to us." "This is the Mahabharata of the new era." "I shall not show the slightest mercy." "I am deadly. You cannot gauge my courage." "I will kick up a storm!" "Your reign ends here, sinner. All that is left is just bodies." "We shall annihilate your lineage" "when the gods of war come together!" "Let's join hands, bring our powers together." "Let's burn them to the ground." "Let's break all the bones in their bodies one by one." "Proclaim victory! The battlefield is empty." "I am mighty. I can keep going." "I give out a strong message. It leaves everyone in shock." "I take them out one by one like the devil." "I show no mercy. I snap necks." "I rip the heads off the bodies." "Dark clouds shroud the battlefield as I move forward!" "He never turns his back. Bhim faces danger head-on!" "We are resolute and confident that we'll rip our enemies apart!" "We never give up. We've tasted countless victories." "We will fight until our last breath!" "We are Indians! Yes, we're Indians!" "We never give up. Launch as many attacks as you may." "We will fight until our last breath!" "We are Indians! Yes, we're Indians!" Rip his beard off! God, why do You grant wishes that I've not asked for? "Bhim will rip you apart and cut off the head of the enemy." "Wound him with as many arrows and bullets," "but this soldier's valour shines through." "The consequences will be dire. You stand to lose everything." "Whoever messes with us shall die!" Where is the girl? I will never tell you! That wasn't the answer to my question. Extracted by balloumowgly Ma'am, we have a problem. Let's move. Who is it? - They seem like Israelis from the formation. Bhim, we have a problem. Israeli Special Forces are outside. What are our options? There's a green car parked outside. You, Mimi and Aria take it. The rest of you... - What are you doing? Stay there and give them cover. Amit is far more experienced than them! I am too, more than you. My mission, my decisions. Ma'am, I was... - That's an order. 'Undisclosed Area' Connect to base. Okay, sir. 'Base come in! Base come in!' 'Base come in!' This is base. Connection is established. Ma'am, do you copy? - What's the update on Bhim and Aria? Negative, ma'am. Both their comms are down. What are our orders? Stay put for further instructions. Copy that. Keep trying. - Sure. 'Keda District' Are you sure this place is safe? We came here five years ago on a recon mission. This was our safe house. Only my team and I know about this place. It's safe. Start sat-comm and CCTVs. We need eyes everywhere. Roger. Hey. Don't worry. We're from India. You are safe. Can you understand me? Great. Look what I found. What's his name? Mr Angel. Wow! Mr Angel will look after you. I'll be back in a while. Okay? Relax, Mimi. I'll be back in five minutes. Mr Angel is with you. I'll be right back. Please don't scare her. I'm scared of children. The cameras are up. We have eyes everywhere. Unbelievable! You have a way with gadgets. Except this I guess. Show me. Problem solved. Let's eat. It's soft and tender. Chicken is always tender. This is not chicken. It's wild rabbit. You're no different than animals. A jackass like you can't appreciate rabbit meat! We'll find out later who is the rabbit, and who is the jackass! Call. 'Base, come in. Come in, base.' 'Base, come in. Come in, base.' This is base. - Come in. Ma'am, we've got Aria's GPS location. Shift to secure line. Where is she? - Keda district. 'It's at a distance of 400 km from here.' 'We received a ping from an industrial sector there.' Leave immediately. - Yes, ma'am. Let's go. Locate Keda district for me. Don't give anyone this information. Yes, ma'am. Hmm. What coordinates did Amit send? Sir, I cannot share that information. Look. I am as worried about them as you are. Understand? I'm really sorry, sir. - Please! Don't use this Rajput lingo with me! Sorry, sir. - Leave this! Get me a cup of coffee. Not from the machine. Go to the cafeteria and tell Gopal. He knows how I like my coffee. - Sir. Go. Do you know where my parents are? Mimi, your parents... - They're dead. They were not my biological parents. They were my guardians. They always told me I was special. I would ask them why, and they would give me the same answer every time. That they'd tell me when the time was right. Do you know who I am? You'll have the answers to all your questions once we reach India. Could I get a pen and paper? What for? To write a thank you note. Who knows you here? Who will read your note? They'll come someday. Didn't anyone tell you that you say thank you when you receive something? Correct. I'll write it too. The feed from comm 2 has stopped. I'll be back. "Come closer and let me feel your sweet lips on mine." "Come into my embrace and give me respite." "Come closer and let me feel your sweet lips on mine." "Come into my embrace and give me respite." "Love me until I am coloured in your indelible ink..." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." "I long for you, beloved. Rain your love on me." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." "Is it the season that makes me crave you or my heart's desire?" "Is it the season that makes me crave you or my heart's desire?" "Do the moments demand our union or my longing for you?" "I want to see you no matter where I go." "This is my only wish." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." "I long for you, beloved. Rain your love on me." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." "Come closer and let me feel your sweet lips on mine." "Come into my embrace and give me respite." "Love me until I am coloured in your indelible ink..." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." "I long for you, beloved. Rain your love on me." "Colour me in your passion. Rain your love on me." Who knows we're here? Someone sure does. "We'll take you down in a moment. This game is addictive." "While we take out foes, we chant our mantra for success." "Our mantra for success is Jai Hind!" "You chase after the girl." "But now, your death stands before you." "You tremble with fear!" "You tremble with fear!" "Patriotism runs in my veins. I love my country." "Your soul shudders, and you beg for mercy." "Why do you demonstrate such naiveté despite your stature?" "There will be bloodshed now. We long for your blood!" "We long for your blood!" "Pick up your gun and seal the enemy's fate." "I hope you remember this lesson. Don't try me!" "We chant our mantra for success." "You are surrounded by danger every moment." "You cannot escape your fate." "You are destined to die." "Your death awaits you." "You cannot win at this game." "My blows will knock you out." "You stand no chance against my wrath!" "Your reign ends here, sinner. All that is left is just bodies." "We shall annihilate your lineage" "when the gods of war come together!" "That's the power of Indians..." How many? - Too many. What's the plan? Annihilation. Have you ever hunted in the dark? No. "When we come together, we are as strong as the sun." "Bodies shall lay strewn across the floor when we will be done." "The only sound you will hear will be..." "Jai Hind! Jai Hind!" "Jai Hind!" You shouldn't have touched her. I told you not to touch her! Bhim! Bhim! We can't leave together. How many rounds do you have left? I'm out. You? Enough to give cover to you and Mimi. What are you saying? Leave from the rear exit. Impossible. I can't leave you here. Bhim, Mimi is our mission, and you're the mission leader. You have to leave. Okay? Let's move. Take care of yourself. Are you okay? Yes. Good. We need to leave. Aria is dead, isn't she? I don't know. We don't have time to think about all this. We need to look for a safe location and establish connection with base. Everyone who gets close to me dies. Even you will die. Nothing will happen to me. Promise? Let's move. Hello. Mission accomplished? 'No.' What! What happened? - 'The package wasn't there.' What! - 'Yes.' It was a set-up. The place was empty. 'Eight of my men died.' 'You gave us wrong information!' Um... Listen. I don't have complete access to the systems. 'If you don't, then find a way to gain access at all costs!' 'Or we will have to try other tactics.' Listen to me... Hello? Darn it! What the... How did this happen? Darn! Think! Okay... Calm down. There's a job for you. I have no one in the world. Do you? No. Can I stay with you in India? The Indian government will decide what to do with you. What are you doing? Let's go. If I am not allowed to stay with you, then I won't come. If you refuse, I'll have to carry you. I will scream if you carry me. And everyone knows you don't like the noise. Okay, I'll try. No trying. Promise me. 'I promise.' I can't do that. But I'll try. Looks like someone got here before us and destroyed everything. Found anyone? Just debris. Had they been inside, they couldn't have survived the blast. Call it in. - Yes. Let's move. Addy, where are you going? Addy, it's not safe inside. Addy, stand down! That's an order! Addy! Are you okay? - Yes. Next time, look carefully. You might save a life. Whenever you're ready for the brief. Bhim knew this safe house. Out of nowhere, we were attacked. It was a sophisticated attack. Special Forces. Unidentified. The three of us couldn't leave together. So, I took a call. Bhim took Mimi out of there, and I gave them cover. How did you manage to find me? Our comms were down. Your comm came online for a few seconds. Then we got a ping for your location. Did you inform anyone else about the ping? Just base. Why? I want to talk to Rajput. Now. Aria, are you alright? Ma'am, I am fine. Where are Bhim and Mimi? Ma'am, I wish to speak to you in confidence. We have a mole. What did she say? Our systems have gone corrupt. We need to find the root soon. Yes, sure. I've found the root! Yes, Bhatnagar. Tell me. - Yes, sir. What was so urgent? Sir, ever since Officer Nandini Rajput became the commanding officer of this mission, everything is going wrong. Sensitive information has been leaking. For instance, yesterday. When we got Bhim and Mimi's ping, that information got to the Russian Special Forces immediately after! How? For your eyes only, sir. But, Bhatnagar... There is no authenticity to these photographs. I agree, sir. Benefit of doubt and all that. But, sir, it'll take some time to solve this mystery. So, I request you. In the meanwhile, take Rajput off the mission's command and put her on probation. Sir, we cannot take any risks in this matter. Mimi, stay close. What are you doing? - What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it. I said stop it. - I said stop it. 'A snake sneaks to seek a snack.' Let's go. I am hungry. My legs hurt. Carry me. No way. - Please! "Life has given me a second chance." "Life has given me a second chance." "A reason to smile again." "I might not be related to you," "but it has brought me respite in your form." "I have found a companion in you." "I have found a companion in you." "I have found a companion in you." "I have found a companion in you." "May your happiness never succumb to the evil eye." Base, come in. Base, do you copy? "I want to give you every happiness in the world." "Though our journey might be a short one," "I want to give you every happiness in the world." "I might not be related to you," "but life has brought me respite in your form." "I have found a companion in you." "I have found a companion in you." "I have found a companion in you." "I have found a companion in you." - I love you. Bhim. Thank God you're fine. I am fine. I missed you so much. Good job. - Thank you. Connect to base. - Okay. Come in. 'Base! Ma'am! Come in.' 'Ma'am!' Not Rajput, from now on, you'll talk to me. Miss Rajput has been transferred. What! She has been transferred! What the hell's going on? Exactly what you're hearing, soldier. From now on, you report to me. Where's Rajput? She's no longer with us. Do you have the package? Yes. Good. Listen to me carefully. We'll be dispatching two helicopters from here shortly. Amit will leave with Mimi in one helicopter. And after exactly five minutes, you and your team will leave in the other helicopter. Is that clear? Why separately? Because I said so. Don't ask questions. Just follow the damn order, will you? Over! And bloody out! Who's in command? Bhatnagar. He wants you and Mimi to leave first in the chopper. And we will follow. Why not together? Hey. Don't worry. Uncle Amit is a good guy, and he will look after you. But you said I get to be with you. I'll be behind you. You'll be safe. Promise? Let's go. It's time for you to go. I don't want to go without you. I'll be right behind you. And Mr Angel here will look after you. You are my angel. You will look after me. Promise? I promise. I will always look after you. 'Amit will leave with Mimi in one helicopter.' 'Just follow the damn order, will you?' Hide. Base, come in! Base, come in! Come in! We are under attack! Base, come in! Come in, base! Now! What happened? There's no response. Where are you going? Bhim asked us to hide. Since when do you follow orders? - Base, come in! Hey... Goodbye, NERO. Sir! What happened? Did you get the girl? - No, sir. I have sad news, sir. Rebels blew up the chopper in which the girl was flying. What! Damn it! I've never heard such bad news! Brace yourself for more, sir. The entire NERO team has been captured, sir. But don't worry, sir. There's a solution to the problem. No, there must be another way. This is the only way, sir. The risk is very high and time is too little. The decision is in your hands, sir. Attention, everybody. Switch off your terminals. Pack your things and leave! Please get up. Exit the building in an orderly fashion. - What are you doing, sir? Project NERO is officially terminated. Your work here is done. Vacate the premises immediately. Leave now. When will our drone be over Adjara jail? In 30 minutes. I don't know how those fools operate this. Hello? This is Girish. - Girish, what's going on? The Adjara army has captured Bhim. NERO has been terminated. Bhatnagar has ordered Operation Clean Slate. The drone will be over the prison in 30 minutes. Mr Khan, what's the blast radius of the bomb? Everything within 1 km of the radius will be blown to smithereens. Good. Water! Need water! You get twice the beating you give me. You mustn't interrupt when I'm talking on the phone! Girish! - Don't interrupt! I had no idea you were so brutal! Jokes aside. Bhatnagar has ordered a drone strike. - What? There's no time for questions. We have to save Bhim first. How? There's an army out there! We'll pose as soldiers. Bhim! I am here. Bhim! - What took you so long? I got stuck in traffic. Now, I will break all the signals! Bhatnagar has ordered a drone strike. What! - Yes. Wait a minute. "This is payback!" "This is payback!" "We all share the same goal. We will make it across the border." "The same blood courses through our veins." "We are ready to hoist the flag." I warned you. You'd get twice the beating you gave me. "We're a country with diverse culture and heritage." "My motherland, India, is incomparable." "This is payback! - We won't stop." "This is payback! - We will keep moving." "This is payback! - We will take you out." "This is payback! - We'll send you to the grave." "His roar is ferocious enough to terrorise you." "You cannot win against this lion." "Those who mess with him will die." "He will destroy everything in his path." Hello. Yes, Miss Rita! The party for your promotion is still pending. Remember one thing. Abhay Bhatnagar never forgets and never forgoes! Get it! One second. Yes? Hello! - 'I never forget either.' Trace this call. Hurry! Go! 'You messed with the wrong guy, Bhatnagar.' Oh! You survived! 'But you won't.' Enough with the empty threats! I am in a place where even a fly can't enter without clearance! Understand? Besides, your file is shut now. You're just a ghost here! 'You are right.' 'I'm a ghost.' 'That's why I don't require clearance!' The call has originated from this building. Goddamn it! What are you waiting for? Get me out of here! I don't need to ask you the question because you already know it. Give me the answer. I don't know where Mimi is. Mimi is in Herzegovina. Herzegovina! Where is that? Herzegovina is the smallest country in Eastern Europe. General Raza governs the place. If you pay Raza money, he'll hand over the reins to you. Then that man has total control. Who do you work for? A man called me about six months ago. 'Log into your internet banking account.' 'Not the salary account, your Swiss Bank account.' They... 'Who is this?' They wanted all the information on Banerjee. That's why you killed Amit. Amit is their man. I have a surprise for you. A special room awaits you. Thank you, Bhatnagar. Hey! Over here! Kill them! Finish them! Shoot them, I say! Get up! Move it! - No! No! Goodbye, Mr Bhatnagar. Yes, Bhatnagar? I've shut Bhatnagar up. I'm coming for you. Oh! You're not dead! I'll die after I kill you. I'll send you my address. Come over. Mimi was asking about you. She has complete faith you'll rescue her. Don't break her heart. Because I've broken so much already! I once made a promise that I could not honour. I won't do it again. We won't let you do it. Bhim. Ma'am. - This time around, everyone ought to know the consequences of inflicting harm on our nation's daughter! Make a statement and make it big. - "Listen, world." This fight is not about the country but one of its daughters. "We're one step ahead." "No one has the power to derail and stop us." "We're a raging ball of fire. We're fast as the waves." "We leave for unknown territories." "We have learnt to live our lives" "without fear and trepidation." "We have broken all the shackles" "and learnt how to walk..." "My motherland is my God." "It is my identity." "Even if I die, my dreams will live on." This has details of the mission. Our deep cover will give you full assistance. We have information that 30 Herzegovinian soldiers are guarding Mimi. Ma'am's instructions are in here. For you. Read and destroy. All the best. What's written in it? Mission. Mission Raksha is a go. They've left. He has your instructions. Bhim knows what needs to be done. Scream. Scream to your heart's content. The pain will suppress your voice forever. We all have to die one day. Today is not that day. He's here. "Things are about to get ugly and terrifying." "The battlefield will soon turn into a graveyard." "The enemy is oblivious to our prowess." "They know not how dangerous we can be." "They're unaware of the consequences." "Their sacrifice shall be in vain." "Whoever messes with us shall die!" "Don't be too proud until you have attained victory." "We will emerge winners, and we are confident of it." "You cannot escape your fate. You are destined to die." "You are surrounded by danger every moment." "You stand no chance against my wrath!" "Retreat! Don't make another blunder." "Now, your death stands before you." "Jai Hind! Jai Hind!" "Jai Hind!" "Jai Hind! Jai Hind!" "Jai Hind!" Is that the best you've got? I am coming. "Your reign ends here, sinner. All that is left is just bodies." "We shall annihilate your lineage" "when the gods of war come together!" "I am a bad influence and a harsh lesson!" "I can take you down in the blink of an eye." "I show no mercy. I snap necks." "Jai Hind! Jai Hind!" "Jai Hind!" "I shall not show the slightest mercy." "I am deadly. You cannot gauge my courage." "You are surrounded by danger every moment." "You stand no chance against my wrath!" "Retreat! Don't make another blunder." "Now, your death stands before you." "I possess untold wrath, and I shall consume you." "This raging fire will devour you, and what will remain is only ash." "We can achieve the impossible. We can crush bones." "My troops can conquer you within a matter of minutes!" Where's the girl? - Why are you asking him? He doesn't speak Hindi. I'm on the fifth level. Come here. I'm coming. "Even the wind fears me. Every punch I throw is fatal." "I am stubborn and strong. You cannot overpower me!" "My resolve is steadfast. I will not stop until I defeat you." "I am stubborn and strong. You cannot overpower me!" "Destruction." "Brace yourself." "Death is coming" "for you." "This is payback! - We won't stop." "This is payback! - We will keep moving." "This is payback! - We will take you out." "This is payback! - We'll send you to the grave." "This is payback! - We won't stop." "This is payback! - We will keep moving." "This is payback! - We will take you out." "This is payback! - We'll send you to the grave." "Destruction." "Brace yourself." "Death is coming" "for you." "This is payback! - We won't stop." "This is payback! - We will keep moving." "This is payback! - We will take you out." "This is payback! - We'll send you to the grave." I've been waiting for this moment for a very long time. I'll break your angel into pieces while you look on! Did you think you'd come here and take here away in a snap? This is my game! My field! And these are my players! Bhim! Get up! You promised me! You cannot break your promise! Bhim! Get up! He can't do anything. I will do what needs to be done! You made a grave mistake, Amit. This is your game and your field! The players are yours! But victory is always mine! Get to the roof. No harm can come to you as long as I am here. We've got guests! What's the plan? Lose them. I can't hold them off. Do we have any weapons? - Yes. Congratulations, sir. The mission was successful. Mimi is completely safe, and so is the world. Good job, Nandini. No one must possess such a deadly power. People change. And so does their approach. Send a message to Dr Banerjee that his girl and all the other girls are the daughters of the nation. And India will always keep its daughters safe. Yes, sir. Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind. 'Bhim, the real mission is not to find Mimi,' 'but to keep her safe.' 'From now onwards, you shall protect her.' 'You got your atonement,' 'and she, her family.' 'And if anyone tries to hurt her...' 'Then I will...' We've located Dr Banerjee. "We'll take you down in a moment. This game is addictive." "While we take out foes, we chant our mantra for success." "Our mantra for success is Jai Hind!" "You chase after the girl." "But now, your death stands before you." "You tremble with fear!" "You tremble with fear!" "Patriotism runs in my veins. I love my country." "Your soul shudders, and you beg for mercy." "Why do you demonstrate such naiveté despite your stature?" "There will be bloodshed now. We long for your blood!" "We long for your blood!" "Pick up your gun and seal the enemy's fate." "I hope you remember this lesson. Don't try me!" "We chant our mantra for success." "We chant our mantra for success." "You are surrounded by danger every moment." "You cannot escape your fate. You are destined to die." "Your death awaits you." "You cannot win at this game. My blows will knock you out." "You stand no chance against my wrath!" "Your reign ends here, sinner. All that is left is just bodies." "We shall annihilate your lineage" "when the gods of war come together!" "That's the power of Indians..." "When we come together, we are as strong as the sun." "Bodies shall lay strewn across the floor when we will be done." "The only sound you will hear will be..." "Jai Hind! Jai Hind!" "Jai Hind!" Extracted by balloumowgly
