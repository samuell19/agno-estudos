[explosion] Fire. Fire. [helicopter] [men screaming] [gun fire] The American people really can't tolerate a renegade, like Frank White running around south america with his militia creating his own foreign policy for our government. [clapping] Frank white is in South America conducing covert activities, which I believe to be neither appropriate or tolerable in our day and age. [all talking at once] The purpose of this comity is to expose what we feel is a dangerous trend... .being followed by the present administration. I am speaking to it's unbrittle use of security and our intelligence services. On September thirteenth a foreign diplomat was brutally assassinate... ...at the United Nation in New York city. The international ramifications of this incident have profound effect... .on the foreign policies of this country. [gunshots] [screaming in foreign language] This tragedy has captured the attention of the public and the media, and has cause the members of this comity to question... ...the roll we have appeared to be taking on in Central America. Specifically Cover operations have been launched and conducted... ...through the Central Intelligence Agency... .and have been done so without appropriate congressional approval. This comity will be dedicated to determining the depth, scope, and lawfulness of these activities. They reek of gun-boat diplomacy, recklessness, and are ultimately endangering our national security... ...and foreign policy. My intention is to prove that Frank White, who is sitting here toady, carried out the assassination of ambassador Miguel Rivera, under specific authority from Central Intelligence Agency. I would like to call my first witness, detective Brian of the New York city department. Detective Brian you responded to the scene of the murders on September thirteenth, Would you tell the council what you saw? Rick Burns. A possible accomplice. Now uh- this location was directly across the east river from the sight of the second murder, that of Mr.Miguel Rivera. At the scene we found an extremely high power riffle. A weapon of a type used by snipers. That is to say a sniper could use this weapon... ...to take a long range, yet accurate shot. Sounds like you did your homework. What sort of sniper weapon? It was a fifty caliber. An army type weapon. So let me make sure I understand this. This is the ultimate weapon to terminate someones life. And White used this awesome weapon to, in fact, assassinate a foreign diplomat at the U.N. Yeah, we think so. At least that is the conclusion the department came to judging from the evidence that we found at the scene. Thank you very much detective brian. That it? I can go then? Yea. I would like at this time to call Rafael Ortiz. Mr.Ortiz, what is your current assignment? I am the Hector Ruiz share holder. At new York University. I am also the head the the policy center... ...for Latin American Studies in New York city. I like at this time for Mr.Ortiz to describe Miguel Rivera, and perhaps to shed a little light for this assembly... ...on the background of his good will mission... ...to the United States and to the United Nations last september. Miguel Rivera was a very charismatic states man. He was also one the the most progressive leaders on the Central American scene. If the United States had recognized that it had friends like Miguel Rivera, perhaps we could have averted this nightmare that we have developed in Central America. I think we are starting to get the picture Mr. Ortiz. Could you be specific about the good will mission, please? I could congressman. Mr.River came to New York to address the special meeting... ...of the U.N. General assembly. Specifically about U.S. Intervention in Central America. At this time he was targeted by the C.I.A for murder... ...and the evidence shows that he was the victim of a snippers assassination! Mr.Ortiz you say that Miguel Rivera was on a goodwill mission to the U.S.? Could you comment on this, just his department document I have before me, that specifically names Mr.Rivera as a mayor conduit... ...for drug smuggling operations based in his country... ...and importing cocaine into the United States! That is a lie! That is C.I.A propaganda! What is it? I stated nothing here! What is this? I think that will be all from Mr.Ortiz, I think that he is commenting on matters that do not pertain to these hearings. The congressional investigations surrounding... ...the assignation of Miguel Rivera got on their was today. Congressman Philip Stumper, centered his attack... ...on former marine officer Frank White. I think we all agree, American foreign police... ...can't be dictated by a bunch of renegades. And sir if successful, will you be running for senate? Let's see what happens the next week. I think congressman marks the investigation on who is Frank White? What is his background? And what was his relationship with Rick Burns? The second man mysteriously found dead... Yeah Phil? Get me the Nelson ratings on my opening statement. Okay? Go! Move. Move. Move. [T.V. Continues] Ellis, send in doug will you? [] I want you to know that we've accepted your letter of resignation. Sir if I may, I don't think it's fair that one man be the escape goat for this entire mess. Mrs. Todd let's get one thing straight... ...congress is gearing up for another witch hunt... ...the politicians are crying for our blood... ...the agency will steer clear of this matter, no matter what. We're all expendable here, Frank white especially. Sir my testimony will not involve the agency. You're damn right it wont. Sir what are you getting at? You signed an oath with this agency... ...you divulge any sensitive information... ...and you'll find yourself being tried for treason. In federal court. Do you understand? [] Stop people take five... Here we go congressman check this out. [] Nice. People talking to people. About thing. About things for... Beautiful, here I come. Bye guys. Hey how you doing idiot? I don't play. The issues are broad based but... ...they're about people like you and me. [T.V. Continues] "People talking to people." They'll buy it. David, did you get the scoop on White? Well I've got Frank White's service record right here. I got to say, he's quite a war hero. Served in Vietnam with Burns. Nothing tarnishing huh? Then get me some dirt on Rick Burns. Well I tried, he's quite a hero himself. Highly decorated. Jesus Christ David, Politics one-o-one here guy. I don't need a couple of heroes, I need a bad guy. Somebody for the media and the people to focus on. That's how things work around here David. Alight? Remember that. For me to win, somebody's got to lose. He's the bad guy, I'm the good guy. He's bad, I'm good. He's bad, I'm good. Now I don't care how you get it, go out and get me some dirt on White and Burns. Got it? Yeah. This stuff in beautiful Oh thanks David. A new approach that's what I like to see. A campaign... I like the entry. You got a visitor frank. Yeah, it uh- a lady friend of yours. I've been subpenaed Frank. Of course. You're the key witness. Their only witness. They offered me an immunity deal. Maybe you better take it. How's your lawyer doing? They gave me this clown. He's street smart though. Pretty tough. He thinks he's over his head. What do you know about congressman Stumper? Not much, Freshman congressman. He came out of nowhere with an incredible ego. I don't buy it, someone is behind him. What's the agency's situation? They won't touch it. I got to be on my own on this one Frank. I've resigned. You've resigned? If I'm no longer with the agency, then I can take the immunity deal. That'll keep Stumper off my back until I can figure this whole thing out. Good plan. I owe you one. Then we're just about even. That's fine Frank. [] [radio] In headlines today, congressman Philip Stumper meeting at the special congressional comity... Daniel, how are you? Good to see you. Congressman so nice of you to come out here to the sticks and visit us. Well I like it out here Daniel, especially when I'm coming to hop-notch with my best constituent. Huh. You listen, you make sure that my name doesn't appear in any of these... ...proceeding your conducting. Well trust me on that. As far as I can see it, you're not involved in any of this anyway. You know, you can destroy the national security council, you can can even topple the administration... . but you just remember one thing son... you working for me. I wish you wouldn't put it quite that way. Our working relationship as I like to describe it Dan, Helps me to buy votes and helps you to keep that Sam of your back. Well if you play your cards right, this kangaroo fucking circus you're running... ...is gonna make you the hot shit young stud on the hill. Now isn't it? I'm sure you're aware of that. Well I'm aware of the potential publicity aspect. Yeah, I'm sure you are. Now the wild card here is Frank White. What do you know about him? He's the key. He's the link to the C.I.A, I mean... ...if I can prove that... he was sanction to assassinate a foreign diplomat on our shores. I'm going to blow this thing wide open. He's a tough nut. Nah, his testimony is going to hang him. When I'm trough with him, he not going to have enough ass left to sit on a thumb tack. Don't worry about him. Oh I'm not worried. Barry you've got to put me on that stand here. Okay? Congressman's witness are lying. They're full of shit. Frank trust me, I know what I'm doing, okay? Let the congressman hang himself with his bullshit witness. We'll buy our time. I've got to build a case for you. What I need to know is what was your relationship with Rick Burns? Rick Burns? Served three tours together in Nam. [gunfire & screaming] Hey you fire that thing, and you're gonna catch some friendly fire from me. They're all over the place man! They're going all around us! They're in the wild man! Yeah you pull the trigger on that M6 and we're gonna catch an RPG round right in this hole. What the fuck is going on? Charlie throwing us a little party. I just got here man. I need to get my weapon. Here you go kid. If we get overrun, you can shoot yourself with it. You an officer? Yeah something like that. Because I'm looking for my C.O. Yeah what's your M.O.S? Snipper. Jesus Christ, they send me another N.F.G? I'm not an N.F.G. I'm a snipper. Alright kid, alright. Maybe I can work with you. I was assigned to Rick Burns. We started working together. As a snipper team? We were good. Definitely one of the best ones over there. The would give us mission that nobody else would touch. How far you figure? About eight-hundred meters. Sh. Don't move man. Movement is the one thing they'll spot. Easy and slow does it. Okay. It's a long shot though. Shit Frank, I can hit a target anywhere from five-hundred to a thousand meters nighty-seven percent first time. As long as I got the right equipment and the right conditions. This is not like shooting targets in training. We're out here on our own, without any support. Yeah, the risk is minimal. You know, we pull the trigger on one of these guys... ...all they know is that somebody fell down. By the time the figure it out, they don't know where it came from. Snipper doesn't have to give blows. They're invisible. Snipper is like God. We just sit up here and survey the world. Point our finger, decide who lives or dies. All alone. Yeah well right now we're waiting for that general... ...to stick his head out, so that I can point my finger at him. You think you can make the shot? You know it. You're ready, you take this one. What's the matter? Playing god is bothering you? Just pretend your a military surgical instrument. I'll spot for you this time. Is this dialed in Rick? Yeah, eight-hundred meters. Don't ever take anybody's word for it, you set it yourself. Take it easy Frank. Talk to yourself, it'll help settle your shot. Okay. Take your time. Okay. We've got all the time in the world. He's got all eternity. [gunshot] Good shot. Yeah come on, let's leave. No. No. Come on, we've got al day. Like I said we're invisible. Well what about after the war? Peace time was always pretty dull. Mustard out about the same time. But because we were highly train personal, we were in demand by various agencies. Hey listen Frank, level with me huh? What are we talking about here? Recruited by the C.I.A. Hey Frank! Let's go. I'm out of here Okay. Ernie! Just kidding alright. [laughing] [photograph flash] Would you describe yourself Mr.White? Well Sir I'm a soldier. Are you currently in the employ of the United States Armed Services? I'm not currently in the Armed Services of the United States government. I am an officer in the Marine Core Reserve. Then you are not a United States soldier? Are you in fact a mercenary or a soldier for hire? Congressman I wouldn't put it in those terms, I have from time to time served on a freelance bases... ...as a consultant for our government in military areas. Where you involved in a covert, commando type mission, in Central America that took place approximately two years ago? What mission would you be referring to? I'm referring to a mission you lead, Sanctioned by the C.I.A. Could you describe that mission please? This alleged mission took place two years ago. And has nothing to do with the matter currently before this comity... ...concerning Mr.Riveras death. In addition my client has not been granted immunity yet-- We appreciate you trying to protect You client Mr.Feld, but this comity will decide what is purtinate and what is not. This mission is a matter of record. We would like to hear Mr.White's version of what happened. Mr.White? [] We were conducting a long range reconnaissance mission. We were part of a joint law-enforcement task force. Under the auspices of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the C.I.A. I lead a six men team comprised of hand picked, highly trained military professionals. Our ops orders were to insert an observer. We got to get you a dead piece. As long as you get me within a thousand yards, ain't gonna be a problem. It was to observe a large cocaine processing plant, deep in the remote jungle of that country. Did your orders include anything other then observation? Move out! Move out! Yes congressman, if we were to to locate certain targets of opportunity, we were to arrest them. [silenced gunshots] Would you elaborate upon that Mr.White? Our intel told us that we might run into certain... ...high ranking members of the cocaine cartel. Who were wanted for extradition. If that was the case we were to carry out that extradition. [gunfire & screaming] Why did you take along a snipper with you? [gunfire & scream] A snipper sir? That's right a snipper. By the name of Rick Burns. I believe you knew him personally Mr.White. Well Rick Burns was our observer, through his snipper training he had certain expertise through long rang observation equipment and it's use. Did you see any... action on this mission? Ah no we didn't, the woman where all back in the city. [laughing] Very funny Mr. White. I meant, did you engage in armed hostilities... ...with the people at that cocaine processing plant? I don't understand the question congressman. Did you engage the enemy? We ran into a very serious fire fight. We had to an affect an emergency extraction. An "emergency extraction." That's a fairly descriptive term Mr. White. What exactly is an emergency extraction? Boby's hit! Forget him, he's history. Let's go! Move! Go! Go! Go! Come on get to the Helicopter! Move! Move! Move! Come on... The mission did not go as planned? That's correct. There was a security leak, they were waiting for us. So you engaged uniformed troops of a foreign power? No, they were regulars. They were employed by the cocaine cartel. There're some more down the line. Get down! Lay flat! They haven't spotted us yet. Sir they're headed for the tree line. They've spotted us! Alright then move! Move! Move! Come on move! Head for the ridge! [screaming continues] Fuck! Shit! [screaming in spanish] You were involve in a fire fight with civilians? Is that correct? As in explained, congressman, they weren't exactly civilians. Did you kill any of these civilians? We defended ourself against a Superior hostile force. I lost four good Americans, my men! I would not know about their casualties, as we were attempting to withdraw after attack. Thank you Mr. White, that'll be all. How did it go Frank? To hell with those guys! Pensil-neck wouldn't let me tell my side of the story. Show em your balls, eh Frank? Didn't get to the good part! They cut me off. Okay you guys, we've got a lot of work ahead of us. Were we able to get that uh, eye witness account of White's las trip to Central America? Not yet Phil, but we're working on it. But in the mean time, The IRS came up with their records of - Oh yeah? - Everything going back to seventy-five. Okay, good. David, what about that military misconduct thing? - Back in sixty-seven? That violation? - Yeah. Whats the story on that? I don't thin theres anything in it, but I'll... [T.V. static] With a live update from Capital Hill, Martin Spustin. Former Marine Lieutenant, Frank White, is due to appear today. Mood on the Hill is quite anticipatory... ...as he certainly is one of the key players in this C.I.A. gate scandal. [] This pretty rough on you Frank? Nah. I've been in deeper shit than this. Where? It was in a place where they weren't as concerned about my human rights as here. Where was that? Central America, a couple of years ago. What happened? On a mission. My whole squad got captured. They took us to a shitty stinking prison. Run by the secret police. It was a one way deal. They put you to never get out. [screaming in Spanish] [screaming continues] Played a rough game. Just part of the rules. They tortured you guys? Yeah, got pretty routine after a while. Ah they weren't very imaginative. Every morning they'd come get us, string us up. It was time for the question and answer period. [] [scream] [screaming in Spanish] Don't fuck with me! The men blamed Burns. Who's Burns? Rick Burns. Team snipper. My oldest friend. Bastard tracked us through the jungle, picking his cigarette buds up. Fuck you Burns! We've been here because of your cigarettes from the start, these nights are a combination because of your ass! You got us here! Fuck you! Back off! I did my job! Son of a bitch is dead! You were suppose to get us out of here. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm better than this man. Burns had lost the edge, got carless. And so we got captured. And then the big guy showed up, and quite fucking around. He killed my men one by one. Jesus Christ. This men are obviously trained professionals. Again, this is not a good thing. Not for me. Not for you. Alright McCall, why don't you tell me what happened? They are part of a strike force... ...that attacked our central cocaine factory. Brutally murdered my men. It was totally destroyed! We lost millions. - Millions. - Okay. I can assure you this will not happen again. That's why I have Mr. Blunt down here. To prevent these uh- sort of things. True Señor Blunt captured these men. I count on you and your political power in the United States... ...to prevent this kind of military force. Well... you just can't change U.S. Foreign police over night, Miguel. You have to fuck with it a little. But now that we've isolated the case, I'm sure that... ...we'll be able to take care of it. I certainly hope so. I've ordered Mr. Blunt to find out what the C.I.A knows about our operations. [spanish] I don't care what they know, and I don't give a shit! I want these men to pay for my lost. I want them to die! [] [screaming in Spanish] Tell me now. What men from our organization are targeted for assassination? I don't know anything. I get paid to eat, shit, scream! Now you'll get paid to die. Fuck you Burns! Your goddamn cigarette buds got us into this shit hole. Shut up Ryan! Don't give them the fucking satisfaction. We die together here. Shut up. Wheres your military honor Blunt? Fuck you. [gunshots] You happy now? They executed each one. It was pretty grim at the end. Well how did you get out? It was just me and Burns. We knew we weren't walking out of there. We saw out chance and we took it. And that's the last I ever saw him, until the day he got shot. [] Wait! Wait! Shit. Where you going? - Wait a minute. - Get off me! Goddam border is that way man! Forget it! I'm going down river. We won't stand a chance apart. We got to do it together. It's over man. Come on Frank, use your head. It's over. I don't need you! You let me down. I don't need you! I taught you every goddam thing you know! We stand on our own now, go our own way. You're not going to make it alone Frank. You're not going to make it alone. Come on man don't let your pride kill ya. Frank! Come on Goddammit we're a team! Frank! Frank! What happened then? I never got another assignment. I had to retire. They hushed the whole thing up. What do you have for me? Those checks can be traced directly to congressman Stumpers political action fund? Drawn by Daniel Waterman? And you'r positive you can trace that? Thanks. Hey Daniel you're forty-five minutes late. I've been here like over an hour. Well I mean, you know, what's up? I'm not very happy with the way these proceedings... ...are developing. Well Dan- I have certain business interest in Latin America. Hey you know how it is down there... ...business, politics, they're all the same. But we're being very specific. What I'm saying is... ...I would hate to appear as a character on your little third world soap opera. Daniel, we're talking about congressional hearings. You follow me now don't you? Careful. Oh yeah sure. Good. Stumper do you have anything to say today? How do you feel... We got to remember our Constitution, our legal system is on the line here. I don't really think it's really right or fair... ...our forefathers didn't intend for us to be govern by a few people. This is a land of the people. [reporters continue] This is Suzanne O'Rourke in front of what you can see is the closed door session... ...of the ongoing C.I.A hearing here in on Capital Hill. I'll be standing by the hearing room door, Bob, keeping a close eye on further developments. I'd like to call Thomas Bills. Who is a former member of the C.I.A. Who is currently testifying under immunity granted by congress, and we very much thanks him for appearing here today. Mr. Bills, what was your assignment in the C.I.A? I was a case officer. I see, and in that capacity did you ever meet Mr. Richard Burns? Yes I did. It was my job to assign him certain task, certain missions. Sir, White's FBI file. Keep this under wraps. Uh- Mr. Bills the assertion had been made that Mr.Burns also worked as a contract hit-man... ...a snipper for hire. Would you be able to substantiate that assertion? Yes I would. He was a wetwork specialist. Oh a wetwork? Could you describe for us what wetwork is? He would carry out murders, assassinations, things of that sort. [] However, he became unreliable after the Central American mission. His behavior was erratic. We had to retire him form the service. He began to work for the private sector. He seemed to be driven by a personal vendetta. He continued to apply the skills that he employed while working with the agency. He was the ultimate snipper. He could blend into any environment, wilderness or urban. He could maneuver anywhere, without being spotted. [gunshot] He was rumored to do anything at the right price. Simply stated he was a contract hit-man. Uh- so knowing this, the C.I.A an organ of the U.S. government, ...actively sought to employ such a man. Is that correct? That is correct. In pure terms he was probably the best military snipper in the world. At least on our side that is. Hello mister, you like nice Chinese girl? Yes this is the place. No, me no like this place. We go to my room. No. You want to be paid, you'll do what I tell you. Now go and tell the land lady that I want the top floor... ...on the lower side of the building. I'll pay a weeks rent in advanced. Have you got that? Okay. Go ahead. [gunshot] Do you have any evidence to connect Frank White to these events? No, we have no direct evidence. Fine. Thank you very much Mr. Bills. Jesus Frank, you're front page news again. Gonna be a legend. This Stumper... ...reminds me of a young Richard Nixon. Reminds me of a dick with ears. [laughs] Who's that lady you got on the outside? Whitney Todd. She's one of you guys. Use to work with her. Big time romance. It was a long time ago. She's already a on something. She's helping me on the outside. Looking out for me. When did you meet her? I used to shoot out at the FBI range at... One day I notice this beautiful woman. That's the lady who visits here? What I really noticed was her shooting form. [laughs] Yeah right. Thats a nice one sin't it? How's it shoot? It shot fine at Camp Perry. Oh can I try it? Look I really rather you didn't. Come on, let me look at it. Are you a member here? Nah, they let me shoot here though. It's got a nice feel. Can I try a few rounds? Go ahead. That's a couple of inches high. I brought the gripping a little tighter. Who are you? You're the best shot I've ever seen. My name is Frank White, and I'm the second best. How you doing babe? Not to good. I got to get out of here. I'm going nuts. I've found some very interesting information for you. Do you know Richard Bills? Sure, case officer. I used to be assigned to him. He testified today in a closed door session. The agency had been keeping tags on your friend Rick Burns. Burns left quite a string of dead bodies. I've heard rumors to that affect. Did he also say that all those hits where against Rivera? No. Of course not. Stumper would never let that out in open court. Those weren't just random hits. Everyone was against a guy in Rivera's organization. Burns wanted revenge. I want them to die. Burns never forgave himself for the death of my men. He wanted to even the score. The men that we killed during the war, were targets of opportunity. It was a military situation. What Rick Burns had on his mind was murder. I couldn't let him do it. I knew that if he killed Rivera, He'd be signing his own death warrant. After we parted ways, I realized that the bond between us was too strong to be broken. I had to stop him. I owed him that. White, I'm going to nail you. You make me sick. Oh what are you going to do? Kill me with your bare hands now? He's probably going to try and napalm the court room. I'd like to at this time hear more from Mr. White... ...on his fantastic exploits. This is a very compelling yarn he's spinning for us here. Uh- Mr. White you have now been contracted to stop a Rick Burns... ...from assassinating a foreign diplomat, is that correct? Well I would say contracted is the wrong word... ...I simply planned to abort his mission as it were. You were to kill him? Rick and were old friend. I had to stop him from killing Miguel Rivera. My problem was that I had to find him first. I knew he'd hit Rivera at the U.N. But I had to figure out where he'd take the shot from. Snippers are well versed in the art of concealment and camouflage. Rick trained me. I knew I would have a hard time getting close to him. [] Rick was a tactical genius. I knew his capabilities. He would find a vantage point at the maximum short range. Where he could make the shot. In order to escape easily, I knew he'd fire from across the east river. There where only certain structures that would offer him the high ground. It was a simple mathematical problem to determine where he would take the shot from. I dreaded finding Burns for several reasons. I didn't know how to stop him without killing him. Also I knew the son-of-a-bitch was dangerous as hell. I didn't want to die myself. [gunfire] You could've been dead Frank. I suppose thank you. You got to call it off Burns. No way. I can't let you do it. Why not? Because you want Rivera as dead as I do. He killed your people. What's done is done. I'm going to stop you. I that your final word on it? Are you telling this comity that you wanted to stop Rick Burns out of friendship? Come on Mr. White. Yes I am. [gunfire continues] [grunts] You're a better shot then that Rick. I never thought we'd windup on opposite sides. We're not! You know that Rick! Hey we can work it out buddy. Help me kill Rivera. Not gonna happen. Why don't you step out, we'll talk about this. Come on Frank, that's not the way we're going to play. You come find me. Kill your man in cold blood. That's not what we're about Rick. Hey Frank, you know where you are? Close to you. Yeah, but I'm invisible. Not to me you're not. Come on, this way. [whistles] Rick was running out of time. He had to get in position before Rivera arrived at the U.N. He was leading me on a wild goose chase. Trying to shake me. It had become a game. A very dangerous game. You lost Frank? I'm up here. You still smoking Rick? Told you that was going to kill you. Yeah, that's all that's going to kill me. It ain't going to be you. I don't have to kill you Rick. I just got to stop you. You running low on ammo? Uh-huh. You running low on time? It ain't going to be that easy Frank. I taught you everything you know. Yeah, about everything I know. I've picked up a few things myself. Rick! Burns! Rick! Oh yea. That's about as pretty as a picture as you could want. Oh Mickey old baby. Me and you have got a date with the history books. Probably going to be the first man to die on the U.N. Steps. And this is going to be the longest assassination... ...in history. Yeah. Step on out there asshole. [gunshot] Rick! You ain't going to make it. You gonna kill me Frank? I doesn't matter. I already did the son-of-a-bitch. Don't make a shit. You going to play God with me Frank? You gonna do me? Nah. I'm out of ammo. Doesn't make a shit, does it? You got a cigarette? [gunfire] [coughing] God! This is what it feels like Frank. Get that- Congressman that is the truth. That's what happened that day. Members of the comity, I move that this case be dismissed and all charges dropped. Uh- council that motion is denied. Uh- this hearing will adjourn until tomorrow. Thank you Mr. White. Council will adjourn until tomorrow at 8 a.m. Sir I have a proposition for you. Aren't you being a bit presumptions Mrs. Todd? We're not here to make deals. I think You'll be interested in this one sir. First of all, I can keep the agency out of all this. And second of all, we can shake up some pretty powerful people. I see. And what do you get out of it? I get Frank White. Sorry I'm not interested Mrs. Todd. Now if you'll excuse me, we have a lot of work around here. As you know, I am to appear before a congressional hearing tomorrow. I'm prepared to make a very tearful statement, confessing my involvement in a covert plot to kill Miguel Rivera. Thats preposterous. I'll make myself, Frank White, and the agency... ...an executive order to terminate a foreign diplomat. It's the new scoop of the decade sir. You'r bluffing Mrs. Todd. Are you prepared to take that chance? [] I'm bringing your little publicity charade to a close congressman. Daniel, what are you getting at? Let me give you a little background on this, okay? Miguel Rivera worked for me. What do you mean he worked for you? I don't understand this. If Whitney Todd testifies tomorrow, she drags my name all trhough this. I'm slamming the breaks on you now. I don't know if you can do that. Yes I can. To make things just a little bit easier. Heres the boobie price. I like boobie prices. I think you will find that sufficient. At this time I'd like to call Whitney Todd. Who is testifying for us here today under a congressional grant of immunity. And we're looking forward to her testimony... ...as we hope she can help shed some light on some of the issues... ...that have been raised here. Mrs. Todd when you were working as a federal agent, did you ever meet Frank White? Yes I have. Where you aware that he was a mercenary that often worked for the C.I.A. Yes I was. Where you ever... ...involved romantically with Frank White? Congressman I really don't see how this question is relevant. Please just- well let the comity decide what is relevant. Just if you could answer the question for us. Yes for a time that is correct. At the time of the Miguel Rivera assassination, where you not working with Mr. White? On a C.I.A assignment? I would rather not comment on that at this time. Mrs. Todd, I don't think you quite realize what is going on here. You've been granted immunity form persecution, and in effect you must answer the questions as they are posed to you. Are we in complete understanding of this? Yes congressman I do believe I have a complete understanding of it. Were you not in fact, part of a C.I.A hit squad, whose specific mission was to kill Miguel Rivera? I would rather not answer that question. At this time I think I would like to exercise my rights under the fifth amendment. You can't do that! We've granted you immunity. What do you think is going on here? You must answer the questions. Now Mrs. Todd how do you account for your presence at the scene of the assassination? You were acting under somebody's orders. Congressman Stumper I can say that I was working on a... ...federally sanctioned investigation. I was trying to develop a link between Miguel Rivera... ...and and international business cartel based her in the United States. Lead by a very prominent businessman. That man's name is Daniel Waterman. I would like to at this time call for an adjournment while I confer with the congressman on the immunity issue. [gavel] [reporters all at once] Congressman you should see this. Congressman I'm not a reporter. I think you should look at this. Let me give you a little background on this, okay? Miguel Rivera worked for me. If Whitney Todd testifies tomorrow, she drags my name all trhough this. I'm slamming the breaks on you now. What is this? I don't know if you can do that. Where'd you get this? We got it. Give it to me. No, I think the public should see this. [] I can explain this. Frank! Frank! Here goes my pension. Dan, listen your name came up in the trail today... ...but I've got everything under control. I'm becoming bored with all your talk. I got the tape. And I can get Whitney Todd's testimony thrown right out of there. You don't get it, your history. Period. Come on Daniel we go- We go way back together? I mean, I'm your man on the capital. We're a team. I don't care. Don't think your the only man in this town that I own. Take the tape. Oh come on. [gunshot] [] Over here congressman! You idiot. Frank! Take this. Alright. They're trying to kill me out there... Get down! [scream] They're all over the place. What are you doing? You reloading? Don't tell me your out of fucking bullets? Forget me, I'm a mess. I'll take care of you Stumper! I'll call my lawyer. I'll be out in two hours! You hear me? Two hours! White, lets make a deal... ...I'll drop the charges, forget the hearings. I'll close the hearings. Waterman is going to kill me. White you got to kill waterman. That what you do! You kill people. You got to kill waterman, that's our deal. And I'll clear your name. Just kill Waterman, but before he kills me. [inaudible] [multiple gunshots]
