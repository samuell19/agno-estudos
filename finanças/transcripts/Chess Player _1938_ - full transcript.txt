Vilnius, 1776 [DRUMMING] One, two! One, two! Company, halt! [ORDERS IN GERMAN] Forward, march! One, two, one, two... "One, two, one, two..." Exact automatons. Baron Kempelen's real soldiers. Kempelen knows nothing! You're not staying in that costume, Gregory Alexandrovitch ? Who is this Kempelen? Again, onions! And black bread. You have the tastes of Tartarus. I've asked you to-- -Kempelen, is he old? -An old what? -An old lover of your Majesty's. -But no, Cossack. I've had so many I don't need imaginary ones. -I hate them all. The Saltykovs, the Stanislases, the Orlovs! Oh, those men! Who is Kempelen? A Prussian? Kempelen is Austrian. Kempelen is Austrian. Don't bite your nails. The fat Marie-Thérèse would have had him hanged as a witch. Me, I allowed him to settle in Vilnius. He's already done me a favour. Is he a spy? No. An eccentric who prefers the company Of his mechanical dolls. Leave your nails alone! And his automatons that imitate life. So... What service did he render you? You are very curious this morning. -I have the right to know! -Oh. I'm the master here! You are the blue pigeon, the golden pheasant the big jealous bear of Catherine's; her little Grichinka. -Oh. -But you are not the master! -Will you accompany me to Mass? -No! No, no, no! Stay here. Never! I've had enough-- [RINGS BELL] It's your heart that I want, to occupy all of it. I don't want us to keep secrets from one another. But you will find out everything. It's about a new wave of rebellion in Poland. Again? -What are they complaining about now? -They're never happy. 80 000 Russian bayonets safeguarded our choice of their king. -King Stanislas! Is he one of your old ones again? -You exhaust me. I'll hang him, your Stanislas! I'll hang 20 000 with him! Like the Turks, bearded! No. I'm going to keep you close. -Hmm. Finished with the quarrel? Amen. Have you been asleep, my boy? Introduce Baron de Kempelen. Oh, no... -What? -Catherine... You're the only one who amuses me. Your Majesty. Baron de Kempelen... Prince Potemkin, Lieutenant-General of the Empire. So it's you who builds those dolls that are so lifelike? Yes, almost. Aren't you a bit too big to be still playing with dolls? Do you build women as well? Life-size? That's it, eh? I'd prefer it if everyone was a little more discreet. -Go and get dressed. -I understand. You always humiliate me in front of foreigners! It was the same thing with Diderot! I've had enough! Enough! He'll return in a quarter of an hour. He lacks tact. Military type. -Was your journey very long? -200 leagues, Your Majesty. Oh, sit down, then. Thank you, Your Majesty. -No incidents? -None. And in Vilnius? In Vilnius? Excuse me. Oh, excuse me, Your Majesty. The smoke won't bother you? Not at all, Your Majesty. We are agitated in Vilnius. The police reports have reached Your Majesty? They're written by overzealous asses. They'd say everything was fine. What is the story of this national hero... this Polish Jeanne d'Arc? How? Sonia? Sonia. The image of Sonia on a rebel flag... She is mad, mad to stand up against me. I've been nothing but kind towards her. But she's always ignored Your Majesty's kindness. It was I who saved her life. At 2 years old, I made sure she was safe. Oughtn't she remember that? -She was 2 years old, Your Majesty. -It's only fair. I'll have her whipped, stuffed in a sack and thrown in the river. And I'll have Boleslas executed. Boleslaw, I made a Colonel. As an example. Majesty, it'd be beautiful should the Great Catherine prove herself generous. You approve of them? You would support them, perhaps? No, Your Majesty. But Countess Vorowska, Upon her deathbed, entrusted her son Boleslas and her adopted daughter, Sonia, to my care. You've failed to watch over them properly. And they love each other, naturally? Like a brother and a sister. Yes, yes. Come, then, what is it exactly that unites them? But a shared ideal. The freedom of Poland. Ah, the innocents! Of course, he wears a sword and spurs and has illusions at his age... But what interest does she have in Poland? It's her country, Your Majesty. But no. Sonia is Russian. -Russian? -Sonia is Russian. -Sonia is Russian? -Those news made the journey worthwhile, didn't they? Let him know, Kempelen, and without delay. That mysterious baby of yours... ...that I entrusted into the care... 13 years ago-- 14, Majesty. That long? Of your friend, our friend, Countess Vorowska... Was a Russian baby. A Russian baby. A Russian baby who has her papers, Just like my greyhound has a pedigree. So you'll understand, my dear friend, that Sonia Our Lady of Polish Independence, Sonia, the Maid of Vilnius, is my greyhound who thinks she is a Great Dane. I hope that for her sake, That the grown girl can see the comedy of the situation. Or else! OH, MY BELOVED POLAND MY DEAR OPPRESSED FATHERLAND I SWEAR THE OATH AND FIGHT FOR YOUR LIBERTY STAND, O GLORIOUS ARMY STAND, O CHILDREN OH, MY BELOVED POLAND... Halt! In the name of Her Majesty, the Empress of Russia. Onwards! In the name of His Majesty, the King of Poland. -Your papers. -What, my ballet partitures? You're a dancer? Yes. Do you want to see my legs? -Gladly. -There you go. -Mademoiselle... -Wanda Zalewska. What a brute I am not to have recognised the star of Polish ballet! -I am Prince Serge Oblonsky. -Delighted. Would it be indiscreet to ask what you are doing in Vilnius? But because you insist, I shall tell you. I am going to pose for the Baron Kempelen. King Stanislas wishes to have a twin sister made for me. Yes. Because he could not have the original, he wants to have a copy. Exactly. Kempelen is waiting for me. Will you let me pass, Prince? What's this? Major Nicolaieff. Monsieur, I'm honoured, but if all the officers in Vilnius are to be introduced to me... -My passport. -There's no need, Mademoiselle. All the officers of Vilnius would be at your feet, If you'd honour us with your presence in our circle. I can't promise you anything. Onwards. But I might visit! What was it that delayed you so? The snow? The snow, and the wolves. -The wolves? -Yes, the wolves. Fortunately, I was escorted for a part of the journey. To pass the time, the lieutenant spoke to me of love He spoke of deserting the army for my sake, of killing himself, That's to say, nonsense. And suddenly, The horses bolt, the Cossacks shoot, I laugh at the Lieutenant's nose and the wolves flee. And thus, I arrive intact, but completely expired. -Out of fear? -No, hunger! I was not expecting you tonight. We were sitting at the table. Please forgive me. But I thought you were alone! I am sorry. My dear friend, Allow me to present the famous dancer, Wanda Zalewska. Madame. Countess Vorowska. Countess Vorowska? But I thought she was... Dead? That word makes no sense to me. The Countess is, indeed, dead. For two years, she has been waiting for me... elsewhere. Two years is a long time. Already would I have rejoined her, Had she not given me the duty of looking after her son. But as soon as I've fulfilled my... I'm sorry! Please, do sit down. I'm sorry. What did you say about me to the King? Oh, nothing. But if you did? "Monsieur de Kempelen is..." Well? "Monsieur de Kempelen is a bizarre personage." Did you hear that? Like Voltaire. It was Voltaire who got me that reputation. Why? Because I surrounded myself with ingenious creatures, far superior to men, who are but lousy apes. -You're not eating at all? -Oh, but I'm thirsty. -Oh, excuse me. Thank you. It's wrong for you to live among these creatures; you'll start to resemble them! Look at me. Give me your hand. Would you like me to dance? Or to sing? What do you want me to do? Nothing. Do you find me unpleasant? You? You are beautiful, You are delicate, you are... delightful... ...but you are alive. Alive? Is that a reproach? The heart of the Countess is a triple silver spring, One for the eyes, two for the hands. The Countess and I, we exchange our memories... and our thoughts... We do not communicate except in silence. -I wish to see your other automata. -My house is your house. -But I am not afraid, you know. -Afraid? What an idea. Come. -Oh! Oh, Monsieur de Kempelen... Monsieur de Kempelen, where are you? Oh. Which one of the two are you? Give me a sign! But... which one? It's... Which one of the two? It's... No, it's me! Oh, don't leave me! Don't leave me! Oh! What's that? No one. I wanted to make a chess player who would win every time. -But it is difficult. -Oh? Too difficult. We cannot compete with God. Oh, what about this one? -That? -Yes. It's Monsieur Gilles. A musician in love. -Ah... he sings? He does what he can. [WHIRRING MECHANISM] Monsieur de Kempelen is a bizarre personage. [GUITAR] -Oh, you are the Devil! -Flatterer. And all this? I don't yet know what will become of them. -Oh! Oh, the handsome officer. It would disappont you. It is shy with women. I have more aggressive ones. -Ones who... -No. Ah, that's a shame. [DRUMMING] Stop them! -Halt! It's over. There is no more danger. The army of the future, that will settle the differences between peoples. No more bloodshed, the victory belongs to but the best engineer. Do you see that deformed carcass? Let's leave. I want to cry, it's so beastly. She will soon be Wanda Zalewska. Oh, no. I don't want to! I don't want to! No, I don't want to! [SHRIEKING AND GIGGLING] -Serge! How nice of you to come. Serge comes to fetch us. We are on duty tonight. Yes, my Colonel. Your choristers are no longer there? -Who are you calling choristers? -Am I the only Russian in Vorowsky Palace? Yes. -My men have heard you singing. -Singing, indeed. -Your Polish anthem has been prohibited-- -Shut up! I shan't report you, but don't be reckless. Anyone else would've alerted the guards. -You're conspiring against the Empress! -We have been a free people. Thank you anyway, Serge. Good night, Sonia. Thank you, Serge. Please forgive him, he has so many worries. -But we rule here! -Don't worry. -I love you like a brother. -The feeling is mutual. -Sonia... -Your being here is dangerous. You are driving me away? Who are you afraid of? -Serge! -Leave. I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks again, Serge. -No need to announce me. Good day, monsieur de Kempelen. What is it, Boleslas? You look very agitated. -Am I bothering you? -No. What is it? Sonia will turn sixteen tomorrow. -Did you come to invite me? -No. I came to tell you... -Do not touch it. -Is it fragile? -It is a heart. You came to tell me what? Well, it's that... for a long time I've doubted and lied to myself... -But... -I love Sonia. -You love Sonia? That's very good. -Monsieur... -And later? Don't mock me. Sonia is my whole life; I want to marry her. -Sonia is a child. -And she must be protected. Sonia is in danger? Perhaps. And whose fault is it? Who was it that chose her to be the heroine of Poland? I did. And there's another danger I needed to talk to you about. - She's young, tender and at the mercies of... -Of what? You are jealous? You fear that she will love someone else? I don't want her to marry a Russian! She, the soul of old Poland. Oh, stop spinning that iron coil! -I repeat: it is a heart. And I am cooling it down. Please tell me you will help me. You know very well I will. But don't concern yourself with the revolt any longer. Don't compromise Sonia unnecessarily. That is my only condition. Thank you. How do you find it? Ravishing. Who is she? Colonel Boleslas Vorowsky, Wanda Zalewska, star of the Warsaw ballet. Charmed to make your acquaintance, Colonel. -And you are the son of... -Countess Vorowska. -Ah. And you are... -A personage... -BIZARRE! Listen. [TICKING] Oh, it beats! You can see yourself dancing, and can applaud yourself. -Can I dance with her? -Try. [MUSIC BOX TUNE] Oh, but she dances better than I! I'll stop her. The head will start turning otherwise. Baron, the hearts of your figures will not avail themselves to dancing or laughter. Until tomorrow, Madame. Goodbye, Baron. Oh, but he is charming! Such ardour! He is in love. Nevermind. It's true. Mademoiselle Wanda Zalewska will come and shake a leg at the officers' circle. She was not praying. We'll keep up the fight. You'll all be here, yes? Orders of the service. We worry a great deal in St. Petersburg, about certain little musical numbers in the Vorowsky Palace. We must put an end to this little Polish cabal. Why did the Empress assign Vorowsky to command Vilnius? No unsolicited questions. A brawl, tonight, at the circle. I'm not going to leave the place. And why is Oblonsky received at the Vorowsky Palace? No unsolicited questions. -It might be useful to us. -Imbecile. It is useful to us, but he doesn't know anything about it. -It's too difficult. -What is? Your eyes. I can't look at them and paint simultaneously. I can't get anything done. You're nervous. Don't be difficult today... -They judge my visits to be too frequent. -"They?" Boleslas no longer salutes me the way he used to. What a strange idea! I am Russian. My presence here irritates him. You are our friend, first and foremost. -Who knows? -Tell me all that you're thinking. If... Go on, be brave. It's difficult to say. If the affection Boleslas carries for you were to change its nature, wouldn't it already have changed? -I've known him since I was a child. We grew up together. I am like a sister to him. A sister? We are mistaken in using these terms. If I felt I'd begun to love Boleslas, I would tell you immediately. -Really? -I promise. And what if he loved you? You'd be the first to know. That... Look at me. I've found it! It's the blue. The blue, and... And nothing else. Nothing but blue. -Ah, Baron! -My little Sonia! -You arrived at the right time. -Tell Prince Serge... -What? What Boleslas's feelings towards me really are. Is that what you want? Prince. Not a word more, Monsieur; I might get depressed. All right. How do you like my portrait? He won't allow me to look at it. It lacks dimension. And it cannot speak. Cannot speak? On the contrary, it says many things. That I am furious? You never visited us after your return from St. Petersburg. My little darling. What did the Empress say? She doesn't like us, eh? -No arrogance, now. Her Majesty will not be ignored. Ha! "Her Majesty..." Calm yourself, my little Polish girl. Look at this instead. -What is it? -My surprise. Nothing. And now... One, two, three. Watch. -There! -Oh, but it's adorable! -Perhaps it's mechanical? -No, it's all warm. Kempelen has more than one trick up his sleeve! Oh, it's so lively! Checkmate. You're very strong, Colonel Vorowsky. Self-defense. Come, a rematch! -Tomorrow. -You'd flee from an enemy, Colonel? I am not afraid, Major Nicolaieff, but my friends are waiting for me. Yes, but the enemy is Russian, while your friends are Polish. I'll leave such subtle distinctions to you, Major. Colonel, you command a Russian-Polish regiment. Be a good player. For once, show a little more Russianness and a little less Polishness? Is that an insult, Major? He's jesting. There's no need to whip a serf about it. Borg. Take this message home quickly. Draw, will you please? The major plays, and wins. I should hope so. I am in a good mood, Colonel. In a VERY good mood! -Come closer, Polish gentlemen, closer! -Come watch, all of you! Ah, yes. Put the little room at her disposal. So she can undress. -Who is it? -No one... a dancer. Thank you. Stéphane! Garrisoned at Vilnius? -Yes. Introduce me, I don't know anyone here! Except you, Colonel, whom I already have had the pleasure of meeting. -Am I bothering you? -A little, Mademoiselle. -No. -The party is that important? -Will you excuse me? -Of course. Check to the king! I'll leave you to it, Major. I'd be very sorry if I made you lose. Me? I win! -Boleslas can't get away from the circle. -When will he come? In an hour. We'll miss the fireworks. Monsieur de Kempelen, what will we do? Let's sit down at the table. -I lost, Colonel Vorowsky. But I know that move. I know it. -It had to be parried, Major. -lmpossible. It's a move of Her Majesty's. [APPLAUSE] I will dance for you... a polonaise. -Bravo! [POLONAISE] [APPLAUSE] [SCREAM] [FIREWORKS] Did you hear that? -No, what? -Like shots being fired. -No. It's just the fireworks. -Oh? Look at me, Sonia. Did you hear that one, now? Why is Boleslas not here? I'm choking... I don't know... [GALLOPING] Horses, can you hear them? [SHOTS] -Let's go back inside. -But a moment. -I'm scared. -Sonia, I have to tell you... No, Serge; not tonight. -But why? -Never again. I sense Boleslas is in danger. I promised you... I didn't believe it'd be so soon. But now, suddenly, I can see everything clearly. -Forgive me. -I love you, Sonia. -Get out! -Boleslas! -Get out! -No. I was sure you were hurt. Was there a fight? You should've seen the other kinds of fireworks. The patriots have armed themselves. We'll chase the Russians out of Vilnius, all of the Russians. Decide, Sonia. I will obey your orders. Go, Serge. Remember that I will remain your friend. Sonia, I have to return to combat. Thousands of men are singing our anthem and marching behind your standard. You are the image of Liberty, Sonia. In fighting for her, I am also fighting for you. ...YOUR ARMY, ALL YOUR CHILDREN... OH, MY BELOVED POLAND... [EXPLOSIONS] -Sonia! Sonia, any moment now, the palace will be invaded. You can't stay here a moment longer. Come home with me. They won't dare come there. I'm waiting for Boleslas. I must wait for him here. Boleslas has gone missing. Tell me the truth! We saw him fall down. He may only be wounded. Come. -Continue. I'm listening. -Boleslas is being cheered everywhere. -And the Russians? -The Russians... er... well... -What? Have they left the camp? Tell me! Tomorrow, we'll get reinforcements. And before the evening, we will have swept away this rabble. I want Boleslas's ears! And little Sonia? I'll take care of clipping the wings of that little blonde angel. And the dancer? Wanda Zalewska is still with Kempelen. Perfect. We'll break her legs. Shut up! Where are the horses? Let's go! At a gallop! -Mademoiselle, Major Nicolaieff has arrived. -Serge! -Where are you going? -To Kempelen. -Leave. The Russian retaliation will be terrible. I'm staying, Serge. Boleslas has disappeared. Leave! I've been called back to Warsaw. I'll wait for you tonight, at 9 o'clock. It's useless, Serge. I will not come with you. I will never abandon Boleslas. Tonight, at 9 o'clock, at the Baron's gate. -Where is your mistress? -Mademoiselle is out. She said she won't be coming back for dinner. But it's the Colonel's horse! Boleslas! ''We... Catherine ll... Empress... of all the Russias..." We hereby declare as a deserter... ...a traitor and a rebel... ...Count Boleslas Vorowsky... ...ex-Colonel of the Russian-Polish regiment at Vilnius. [TRUMPET IN THE DISTANCE] 5000 gold rubles ...will be handed over to whosoever turns him in. ...anyone attempting to shelter him will be condemned to the punishment... ...of being whipped unto death. [WHIPCRACKS] 5000 gold rubles will be handed over to whosoever turns him in. ...anyone attempting to shelter him will be condemned to the punishment... ...of being whipped unto death. -All right? -Yes. -Not too tight? -No. Your legs? In pain. Could you stay there for two hours? I don't know. To get you into character, we'll have to keep you in there a bit longer each day. That's cheering! -What? -That's cheering! -It's but a matter of getting used to it. -My poor friend. What torture! We haven't got much of a choice. We've got to get him out of here. And quickly. Of course, this won't be without its difficulty and danger... -When will we leave? -As soon as possible! Yes, yes, yes, my poor friend. Oh, dear! There. [KNOCK ON THE DOOR] It's Major Nicolaieff. Get back in there! Sonia, go to your room. [WINDING MECHANISM] A thousand apologies! A thousand apologies, Major! This lackey does not recognise people of quality. My apologies. Yeah. Do come in, Major. What gives me the honour? But a simple visit, my dear Baron. -Residential? -No. I left a police officer at the door. Then, there's no one left. So, the man is an artist! Thank you. -What's this, a pilgrim? -This? It's my chess player. My latest creation. 15 years of work. -Does he really play chess? -Yes. -Can we try it? -You're welcome. Be careful, he is not dry. I am still painting him. [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] I know that move. But he plays like a boor, your Turk! It is a mechanic. You won? No, but I've had enough. Do you sell your automatons? Occasionally. To people who deserve them. They're expensive. -Does the chess player have an admirer? -No. -How about her? -Yes. Commissioned by King Stanislas. I will deliver her to Warsaw. -Take your Turk there at the same time. -No. -It'd amuse the king. -You think so? His Majesty is a chessmaster. The Turk, the dancer... it'd be a huge moving operation. No, no. I'll give you horses and an escort. -When are you going to Warsaw? -I am in no hurry. Of course. In any case, I will remain at your disposal. Just notify me the day before. No, really, thank you. I couldn't possibly take advantage like that. Not at all. To amuse the king... See you soon. -Did you hear all that? -Yes, yes. Thank you. Oh, my little Sonia. -So, what did he say? -I'll tell you. The adventure begins. It is you, mademoiselle, who will have the honour of taking the first step. [MUSIC BOX TUNE] There! How charming. We found it curious, this mechanical ballet. Baron de Kempelen is a bizarre personage. Now, I would like to see the chess player. Your Turk, Baron; I would like to see him, I would. Your Turk, there. Sire, we were waiting to serve your pleasure. [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] Absolutely nothing, as Your Majesty can see. Yes. I can see what it is. It's algebra. Algebra of the springs. Exactly. If Your Majesty would care to appoint the most worthy player... The most noble? But, you see, Baron... The most noble of all would be the King, of course! -Sire, we dared not hope for such an honour. The game of chess is a royal game, Baron. And we know how to play the game to our advantage, Even if it's been remodelled after the Greeks, or so they say. Sire, it is you who will attack. Let's attack. [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] Not bad. Now, there's an idea. Here's the riposte, my friend. He plays very well! We salute, and move this knight. Oh! Ah, he's taken my rook! Baron, we are defeated. Sire, not yet! I tell you, we are defeated! Your Mahomet has held me up. There's nothing I can do now. This Turk is a mathematician. It's Pythagoras, Archimedes! Sire, you overwhelm me. I want to buy it. Impossible, Your Majesty. "Impossible" is not a word in Polish! How much do you want? -Erm... -Sire, the chess player has already been sold. To whom? Her Majesty, the Empress of Russia. It's she I wanted to gift it to. All is well. I acknowledge the honour your sovereign bestows upon me, Major Nicolaieff, but I didn't know... Thank His Majesty the King, thanks to whom you now know it. The roads to St. Petersburg are not safe. I will provide you an escort, Baron. -Sire, The Prince Serge Oblonsky has already assumed that service. -When do you leave? -Perhaps... -Today. -Already? -If Your Majesty allows it. -Good, good. Baron, don't forget to tell the Empress, on my behalf, as soon as you see her... "The troika was light, and the sunflower was in bloom." She will understand. Prince, I leave Monsieur de Kempelen and his marvellous chess player... ...in your care to guard him from any mischief. There, that's all. You are dismissed. It's Serge who is to escort us to St. Petersburg. Serge will spend the whole night around the automaton? How will Boleslas get out without being discovered? -(Serge.) I can't take this any more. I surrender. -Boleslas, it was you inside-- -No need to keep up the farce. -It's useless. I'm caught. -I swear I know nothing. -Do your duty. I'm tired of playing the clown here. I'm a soldier, not an attraction at a fair or the court! Now, I understand Major Nicolaieff's orders. You should thank him! My head's worth 5000 rubles. Do you really think I'd turn you in? Now you can have your revenge on me on the pretext of duty. -Don't hesitate! -No, Boleslas. I remain your friend, and always will, despite appearances. -And Sonia? -Yes, I loved Sonia. -And always will. -It's you she loves! You're trying to console a condemned man. -Sonia loves you. -Stop lying! -I ask for your forgiveness, Sonia. -Serge... I'll do everything I can to help you. -You understand the risks? -I understand them very well. I am a soldier, not a policeman. Thank you, Prince. Thank you. Sonia, you can't come with us. -I? Don't even think about it! There are too many risks. You'll be making a great sacrifice for me, Sonia. You'll be safe while I hide inside the automaton. I'll never leave you! Never. Be reasonable. You're everything to me. You'll go over to your side, dressed as a peasant. And we'll arrange to meet up someplace. It's a great ordeal you are imposing upon me. -Hmm, Sonia. Colonel Boleslas Worowsky will be delivered unto you alive... Hidden inside the chess player. Baron de Kempelen still hopes to smuggle him out of Russia. I've conducted the affair discreetly, as per Your Majesty's orders. Do you like your coffee strong? -Er... yes, You Majesty. -Ah. So do I. You, you've had your cream. Wait! -But Your Majesty, it's only that... You haven't had breakfast. You've galloped all night to bring me the news. It's only natural. Ah. This is my favourite time of the day. Without generals, without ministers, and finally without a servant. Only my own little household. Because I'm seen on portraits with a crown on my head, putting on airs, They imagine I am quite arrogant... But it's only Russia I love, my little household. Drink it while it's still hot. What are you looking at? The furniture, Your Majesty. Ah, my chair with the hole in it. It's the throne of the Polish kings. You find it funny, hmm? So does Voltaire. Funny or not, Poland is finished. I shut Frédéric and Marie-Thérèse up by stuffing them with Poland. I won't snatch the cake away to appease a couple of agitated hussars! You will return to Vilnius tonight. Search de Kempelen's house from top to bottom. -Your Majesty... -Tonight. What, are you too tired? Exhausted? No, Your Majesty. It's only that the Baron is Austrian. -So? -He has certain rights. -What rights? -Citizens' rights, of the treaty... -What treaty? Rid yourself of those silly ideas that burden the imagination. Empty that old maniac's drawers. I want names, and then, hangings! -Only hangings? -Yes, I hate violence. Her Majesty Elizabeth cut out conspirators' tongues. -Ah. I think it's too messy. It wasn't too bad. -Let me do it, Your Majesty. -No. I'm used to it. What time do they arrive? Kempelen, the doll and Boleslas in it, return to St. Petersburg tonight. Guided by my escort. What kind of a reward do you want? -Nothing, Your Majesty. -Really? The confidence of Your Majesty is enough. Come here, so I can kiss you. You're the first. It's true. I pay everyone, all the time, and for everything. In these, they call me Minerva, Semiramis of the North, Holy Mother. What next? All these philosophers. And why? To get money! -And the little one? The little one? -Sonia. -Oh, pardon, Your Majesty. -I let her escape, dressed as a peasant. -You've done well. -I obeyed orders. -You've not lost sight of her? No, Your Majesty. My men... Have them bring her to me, without tiring her out. I want her to enjoy herself... it's carnival time. Has anyone seen him, this famous chess player? -No one. We can't get near him. -Why? It's guarded by two grenadiers. I know the inventor asked for it. -Have you never been to the court before? -No. Magnificent. Her Majesty will mark you straight away. I get the feeling you are mocking me. It would be most unwise. Tomorrow, the royal doctor will examine you and the day after, you'll be the new favourite! You're telling me fables. Look. The Empress is watching you. When are you going to appoint him as the aide-de-camp? Tonight? -Perhaps. Oh... -Oh, but I've suffered thanks to the old ones... -What? I suffer even more thanks to the new ones! It has no effect. First, it was one per week. Then two. And soon... I serve the Empire by educating its talented youths. Your turn to play, Cossack-- and don't tear up the beize. Ooh, but when you look at one of them, like so... That's it! Yes, that's it; you tore up the beize, my doggie. I'll ask Kempelen to make me a billiards player. I am delighted with my new toy, Kempelen. Would Your Majesty wish to try it out tonight? No. Tomorrow, or later. We'll see. I'm a little intimidated by it, it's true. Tell me something, Kempelen. I couldn't ask you in front of everyone... What news of Sonia? Your Majesty, the poor child was so afraid of your wrath that she ran away. Where? In the night... alone... the snow... and the wolves! Oh, you know how people exaggerate about the wolves. And Boleslas? Dead. You're sure? I've lost all hope. Sometimes, surprises happen. Your Majesty... If they came back, would you pardon them? I know your heart. One must govern people with one's head, Kempelen. We do not play chess with a kind heart. Chess? Why chess? It's a saying of Rivarol's. Close the door. Ah! So you have been resuscitated, Countess Vorowska! Her Majesty the Empress! Her Majesty the Empress! Let us see this intrepid chess player, then, who wasn't afraid to traverse fields of snow to compete against us. Monsieur de Kempelen? [MURMURING IN THE AUDIENCE] The chess player I have the honour of presenting to Your Majesty tonight is, from among my numerous automatons, the one I am proudest of. Ah. He replicates not only human movements but also, in his way, thoughts. He thinks before he acts, He calculates his moves, And he-- -Yes. And he only lacks speech. Let's see, let's see. We await Your Majesty's commands. -The automaton plays all by itself? -Perfectly, Your Majesty. Before we begin the match, can you assure me that there is, in this, not a trace of deceit? But, Your Majesty... how would you like me to prove it? Oh, I don't know. A child could be hidden inside of your machine. There's no one in it, Your Majesty. We'll see about that! Bring me a hammer! -It's pointless. -Why? It's easy. Just two blows-- I'll take the Baron's word for it. Thank you, Your Majesty. Please see for yourself, Your Majesty. Indeed. Play. Heads for the mistress, tails for the Turk. The honour of the first move falls to you, Monsieur Turk. [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] Take a few steps back, Monsieur de Kempelen. Further back. You may say it out loud. There are only patriots here. and one... The Polish Jeanne d'Arc has just been arrested! We've captured Sonia! LONG LIVE CATHERINE! -Baron, look! It's never done that before. The mechanism is broken? Yes, yes; most certainly, Your Majesty. Bring me a hammer! Oh, don't shout in my ear! You would risk breaking a delicate spring, Prince. So what! We've already made too much of a fuss over this puppet! And why have you dressed him as a Turk? -Yes, it's somewhat inappropriate. -Inappropriate? It's a provocation! Can Your Majesty not see-- A Turk! It is a provocation! Burn the Turk! -On a bonfire! -OH, YES, YES! It's made of iron. It will not burn, Prince. Ha! Let's drown him, then! OH, YES! YES! The Neva is frozen, Prince. We still need to do something to him! This Turk shows no respect! That's it, we'll shoot him! That's it, a firing squad! To music, tonight, before the fireworks begin. [LAUGHTER] Your Majesty! Silence! Majesty, you would be destroying a work of art I've taken great pains to create. I could start again, even improve it, Were I allowed to look for the cause of this unexplained malfunction that took place earlier... I think it was some cog... Play the watchmaker as much as you like, Monsieur de Kempelen. Thank you. But under the watchful eye of my new aide-de-camp. Prince Serge Oblonsky. Your Majesty? Accompany Monsieur de Kempelen. You'll never see me again! Until tomorrow! And now, dance! [CREAKS] Monsieur de Kempelen is a bizarre personage. [LAUGHS] Monsieur de Kempelen is a bizarre personage. [CLINKING] -Kempelen! [NICOLAIEFF LAUGHS] Kempelen! Stick out your tongue, Baron! Stick out your tongue! [DRUMMING] Oh, you look much better when not dressed as a peasant. It's my dress, from when I was a little Grand Duchess. I am careful, you see. Are you very tired? Why did you give me chambermaids? Why this dress? You have no reason to show such concern for me. What do you know? I am Polish and a rebel; I know what awaits me. What, then? I saw the fusiliers at court. -We will shoot the chess player! [CHEERING] [DRUMMING] Soldiers, halt! You must cheer up; it's the only way to make life bearable. Take aim! [GUNSHOTS] You look pale. Are you cold? No, Your Majesty. -There's blood on the snow! -The Prince... What? How can it be you, Kempelen? [KEMPELEN GASPS] Your Majesty... I would've asked your permission to retire before the carnival was over... But... This was better. I think so, too. I was very curious to learn how you'd work your way out of such a compromising adventure, Monsieur de Kempelen. You're looking at it, Your Majesty. I admit I had not thought of this option, which does not change anything But removes yourself personally from this affair. -Are they safe? -Yes. Thank you. Now, Your Majesty, I may as well die, too. Follow me. Ah, big words. But no, Your Majesty; I am a traitor! Taste the Crimean grapes. They taste delicious. -Your Majesty, I want to atone! -You've been heard. I aided and abetted the escape of two rebels. Good for them. -But... -What? They love each other, the rebels. They'll only think of themselves. They'll leave Poland alone, no? -Yes. -Well, then! -They are free? -But of course! Oh, please help me, darling; you can see it! [BELLS] Monsieur de Kempelen Is a bizarre personage. Monsieur de Kempelen Is a bizarre personage. [MECHANICAL WHIRRING] Bizarre... Bizarre... Bizarre... Bizarre... Bizarre... Bizarre...
