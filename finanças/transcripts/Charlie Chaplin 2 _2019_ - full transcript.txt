Your sister is like crow's crap! Your father isn't father-in-law only to me Let me tell you 'He is the father of all procurers!' Choosing a bride from a 3rd rate family like yours ...when we are far superior we should die of shame Do you know how sincerely I loved you? When I told you to exchange your old phone for a new one You refused saying you like to have 2 phones I didn't understand then Now I know what you meant You like 2 of everything I AM A SECOND HAND! May even be 3rd or 4th hand! Even 5th or 6th! You think only you can have a 2nd hand? Thiru can't, huh? I am Thiru's second hand Sara will be so mortified she will wish she's dead Call yourself a friend?

I've been trying to reach you since 4'o clock Sara and her father have already left for Tirupati He's talking to someone else instead of calling his son - Hey, who is on the phone? - My dad Immediately stop the wedding Tell him to cancel the wedding - Appa - Hey! Don't - Give me the phone - Why are you snatching it? Stop playing the fool It's his life Give it to me Listen to- Hey! Don't- Talk...go ahead [carefree laughter] 'You watched a sample of joyous laughter' 'Next you'll be seeing a bride' 'Suppose she is in contact with a smart guy like me before her wedding' 'Coming to know about this...' '...the entire town will ridicule the bridegroom' [scornful laughter] - Bash him - Don't hit me Why mess up my friend’s life? - Stop it! - How long have you known Sara? Why are you hitting my son? For what your son did- Your assumptions are all wrong 'I used to mimic many people even when I was a kid' 'My dream was to become #1 in mimicry' 'I visited several TV channels to fulfill this dream' 'But my talent never received the due recognition it deserved' 'Out of frustration I decided to commit suicide' NO 'Sara madam was the one who rescued me at that time' 'The First Aid she administered...' '...was captured in a mobile by someone who uploaded it in Facebook' 'But not bothering about it one bit' '...she nurtured my career by getting me a job in a TV channel' 'She was God in human form!' "Trusting many a 'forever friend' this heart has been deceived in the end" [song from 'Simla Special'] "This heart has been back stabbed in the end" "Toddy and milk differ by name But in color look the same" When you were leaving for your wedding in a happy frame of mind ...the scumbag who showed you this video If only I get hold of him my slippers will speak! Fortunately your presence of mind brought you here directly If you had listened to the advice of bad friends... ...and yelled at her in a drunken state '...your marriage would have been called off' That's why I cautioned you, dude Not to text in a drunken stupor Mistake, machan Even I said ...to enquire properly before calling even though I was drunk Machaan! - Dude! - Thiru Don't get mad at me I did all this purely in good faith Don't get mad at me Drop it Okay, forget it He was in a drunken stupor What is the use of forgetting now? She would've seen my message My wedding has been called off Because of you- Machan, your phone Pick it up Just check who's calling Dubai, move aside Uncle is calling from there Why are you hesitating? Be bold and speak up If he sounds positive means he didn't see your text - In case he sounds negative - End of story! Dubai, you'll be dead meat, man Attend the call 'Hi 'maro', good morning, Where are you?' He hasn't seen it Go ahead, reply - Maro? - Talk to him 'Where are you, maro?' Where are you? At Thiruvalangadu on the way to Tirupati Our whole family is in the temple of our family deity 'If Sara gets the right match we had taken a vow' ...to adorn our Lord Shiva with silk, light lamps as per our custom And distribute food to all the devotees That is in progress now I asked God for a good son-in-law But... ...I never expected He would bless me with a good son! Maro, don't mistake me for asking you I need a small favor On your way, at Tamil Nadu and Andhra border... ...there is a small 'idli' shop at Kanakammachatram 'Masala vada' in that shop is simply sooooper! If you can get me a few crisp 'vadas' and thick coconut 'chutney' as take away My stomach will remember you till my last breath, huh!? - Okay, sir - 'Why are you calling me sir?' 'Call me mama' 'Or call me 'mamov' in a stylish way' 'Come soon, maro' Okay, uncle You heard that? Happy now? Hey Don't worry, there is an easy way to stop Sara from seeing this message There is an option 'Delete for everyone' When you delete from your phone... ...she won't be able to see it Even I am aware of that But that holds good only for an hour A whole night has passed - This can't be deleted - Yes Both of you dozed off totally tanked last night Then how can you delete? 'How dumb can they get! Highly irresponsible' Don't lose your cool, Thiru Give me your phone I can see only a single tick Message has been delivered but Sara has not read it Okay...? Look at me Your uncle will take atleast 90 minutes to leave Thiruvalangadu Between Thiruvalangadu and Tirupati... ...you won't get signal anywhere Because I've travelled that route There is no chance of Sara seeing the message before that So...if we leave immediately from here ...catch up with your father-in-law's car and take the phone from Sara - All issues can be solved - Let's do this If we take the Tada route we can catch Sara's car So says Google! "Breeze wafting over the screwpine flower Makes a fragrant impact on me forever" "The floral scent sets the stage for me" "Converses like a lass ever so lovely" [song from 'Mullum Malarum'] What a song! No one can match our Ilaiyaraja Is it that easy to be hailed 'maestro'? Soooper! Listen to the violin now I can hear someone munching 'murukku' Grinding your teeth? Sorry Hey Dubai, have you set the right address in Google? - Yeah - By the way 'Have you taken this route earlier?' Then what? Recently About 25 years ago I went with my parents to Tirupati to have my head tonsured I've typed that route Check for yourself Tada Tada...Tada 'Tada Forest' Don't worry, we'll drop them back in our department's jeep 'Now...present moment' Thank God No blue tick! Sara hasn't seen it as yet Should go before Sara sees the message We'll make it As it is we are late by 30 minutes By now they would've reached Tirupati - Sir, how far is Tirupati? - 13 km away, sir - Thirteen, huh? - Please speed up, sir Hey, we have reached Tirupati Please God, save us Sir, that's the hotel Take left Senior 'maro' counted the suitcases? I'm checking, 'mama' Hey...junior 'maro' Why have you come in police jeep? On the way our car...break down - Police...friend- - Not anything drastic? Thank God What? Did you get me the crisp 'vada' and thick coconut chutney? The crow pecked it away! Gone with the wind, huh? If you can't take care of a 'vada' how will you handle life? It's okay Sara - What? - Gauging the happy mood I don't think she has seen your message Why do you say that in such a sad way? Thiru...hi! Appa...? What, my dear? Thiru, what is this? Why did you to this? Do you know how sincerely I loved you? I never expected such a message! Your father has ordered 1000 'laddus' for our wedding He has forwarded that message to me proudly 'I have ordered 1000 'laddus' from Tirupati' Why should your father do what my father has to do? Why did you hide such a huge issue from me? Good question, my dear Did my father send such a message? Yes Appa! Let me see Low battery Wait, 'maro' Ramesh is my close friend who is in charge of the 'laddu' section in Tirupati temple If your dad had told me I would've ordered bigger 'laddus' He should do what he is good at Your dad did what he shouldn't do You didn't do what you should have You forgot 'vada' and my request Hope you don't forget the bride Thank god Instead of a full stop, God has added a comma and story continues You may have escaped now When phone gets charged you're in for 'lathi' charge! He has a PhD in Negativity Nab him and thrash him 'Good omen for your married life' Welcome Who said you can order 'laddu'? Isn't it the bride's side protocol? What is he saying? Welcome Taste this sample 'laddu' Please come Send 4 'laddus' to my room without anyone's knowledge Didn't I ask you what he's saying? Wants 4 'laddus' sent to his room WITHOUT ANYONE'S KNOWLEDGE! - Why shout a secret so loudly? - Has he gone? Aishu baby, take your parents to 7th floor Daddy, which is my room? Sara darling #317 for you Gayathri, your room is #318 Our rooms are adjacent - 'Maro' - My room is on the top floor Can I be in the 1st floor or 2nd floor or- - I can be in the 3rd floor? - 3rd floor Sir, 3rd floor is fully occupied You are spending so much for our wedding Your expenses are mounting Thank you I can help you reduce cost And stay in Sara's room - Did I hear you right? - I am in #801 Call me if you go down to eat #801 is a good number Let's go #302 is available, sir Thanks Keep my phone with you, sis 'Hey you! Sara!' 'Are you such a big shot?' 'I fell in love with you wholeheartedly' 'But you need to break a variety of hearts, huh?' Choosing a bride from a 3rd rate family like yours ...when we are far superior 'Beat the wedding drums' NO!

She looks like a palm fruit seller at the tollgate? His boyfriend must be a guava seller for sure Go and tell her she can find her boyfriend soon You are suspecting me of being unfaithful, right? You should be suspicious You should ask me who she is and why I hugged her? And I owe you an answer! Why did you hug her? You shouldn't ask at once We should think with foresight What should I think?

Some chap has cheated her and absconded Cheated her? I feel like puking when I see her If a man cheats a girl naturally she will puke If she has conceived! Why are you behaving like a mental patient? Affected by this, she has become mentally deranged She says, 'hug me, marry me' to every random chap she meets I'm her brother's friend and instead of considering me as her bro too... ...she wants me to marry her This is the state I am in and you- I lost my temper, Sara You feel so bad for your friend's sister You're really great!

I'll forward the message and stop the wedding Thiru From the beginning I wanted this wedding to be called off But we successfully got 99 couple married How can so many issues crop up in your wedding? Instead of lying so many times to hide one single lie ...let's tell Sara the whole truth She'll definitely forgive you "Love is just like a pane of glass How will it stick once it breaks, o' lass?" "How will the fishes in the sea swim on the ground, tell me?" "Love is like a mirror, dear Once broken how can the shards adhere?" "How will the fishes in the sea swim on the ground, tell me?" "Will we get yesterday once more today?" "Can we forget the days we spent in blissful ways?" "Love is just like a pane of glass How will it stick once it breaks, o' lass?" "How will the fishes in the sea swim on the ground, tell me?" "Love is like a mirror, dear Once broken how can the shards adhere?" Sara's room? Sara's classmate, huh? Welcome Go straight and turn left I'm from King Mobiles What can I do for you? Will you believe if someone tells you your mother's milk had poison? That's the analogy for saying Thiru suspects me "If flowers go on suspicious mode petals will wither with heads bowed" "Even the 'Bodhi' peepal tree here will turn to firewood fruitlessly, dear" "A journey can't be undertaken without ups and downs uneven" "No love on earth is possible if separation and reunion not feasible" "Love is just like a pane of glass How will it stick once it breaks, o' lass" "How will the fishes in the sea swim on the ground, tell me?" "Love is like a mirror, dear Once broken how can the shards adhere?" We can somehow manage if she suspects you She trusts you I don't know what I'll do If Sara knows the truth she will die, I say If this Saara knows she will kill you! Only 2 more hours for the function Before that, Sara's lover- The lover who jilted her as per our story, find a real one The truth will be out afterwards We'll cross the bridge later We have to deal with this now This is the only way to perform this wedding Because we have all made such a big blunder You made me hunt for a lover for my own lady love!

Is it enough if you just feel? - Who is Sara? - Who? - Your wife - Oh! Shouldn't you have taken her in your bike by now? He took away my wife instead of my bike Was she taken away? He came to take her away She must be here somewhere...hahn! She's here 'Is she also here?' 'Have you started Bigg Boss Season 3?'

'Even though you didn't pick my call for a whole week...' ...Akash has updated me spic and span like mopping with phenyl 'You're the luckiest man in this world, dude' 'Or else even after watching the video with all your choicest cuss words' '...would she have married you?' 'Even if her face is like an egg fritter' '...her head is devoid of brains!' 'Thiru, whether it is a bathroom or toilet' '...only if you clean it once daily your house will be spotless' 'Same way if your life should be without any blemish' '...you should watch the video you sent Sara, once a day without fail' 'Keep your mind clean promising yourself not to make any such silly blunders' 'I am sending my copy of the video to ensure you lead a happy life' At least understand now One who walks with you till the end is your friend 'Sara' 'Think you are the cat's whiskers?' subtitled by rekhs assisted by harini & krish From Sunnxt
