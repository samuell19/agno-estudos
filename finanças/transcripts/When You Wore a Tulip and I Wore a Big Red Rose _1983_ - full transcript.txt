- Well, it was a big dark room. That was the first thing. You walked into this big dark room, and then there was always the whir of fans in the ceiling to keep the people cool. Then after a while, if the musicians weren't ready, you heard the whir of the movie machine, and that was up back of us, projecting the picture on the front. The musicians wouldn't start until you saw that the action of the projection machine was starting. (piano music) (projector chattering) So, if the musicians rested for a bit and didn't play, then you heard the machine. And that was also lovely. It was all part of it. People weren't really fussy. They just wanted background music. - [Stephen] I see. - And something very sweet at the beginning, I could give it something like ... (slow piano music) Then it gets more exciting. Then of course I have to match that. (upbeat piano music) - Would you have played just for the movie? Or would there have been a stage show sometimes connected with your ... - Oh, yes. - Could you tell me about that? - Of course. In River Falls, when we played there they had a billing of a magician between acts and he was going to read minds and we had to play some music before he came on. Of course, he swept in onto the stage with this long oriental garb and looking as it he could just tell what everybody what thinking about. - I sort of have an idea that somebody came from away and just said, now, it's a good way to advertise Wausau. I don't know that that's true. But I just have an idea that that was it and they picked out, I think, probably wherever they went, people had to pay for being in it, you know. - I still don't know how he did it, but he would pick out what somebody was expecting a letter in the mail that day, or they had got a letter. - Yeah, well, I heard quite a bit of it in the letters you wrote to me and everything describing it. Now, I'll read this heading on here, the Wausau Show In Moving Pictures. "Wausau is to be filmed. "A contract has been made "for a set of films of this city, "showing in pictures its growth, "development, and industries." - Yes, that was exactly what they had done. And it was that type of thing, so, of course, then we would have something oriental perhaps. (oriental piano music) - "The operators will be here in a short time "and the city with will be furnished "with considerable excitement during their stay, "where they will take some unusual and unique pictures." - Incidentally, his name was Mirage. He was billed as a Mirage. - [Stephen] So really, there were no silent films. You always had music to go with them? - Oh yes, yes, it was quite a noisy affair. Yes, it was very much of a sound effect thing, too. - [Stephen] And then you had-- - And the show on the stage. And of course, some of those were musicians and played their own music. The type of, well, this type of thing. - [Stephen] Well that song, and your memories, date from the earliest days of the silent motion picture. - Oh yes, 1914, it says. Youngsters, I was a youngster, thought she was pretty nice and we were all going to be stars like she was. If somebody asked, "What are you going to be "when you grow up?" Oh, I want to be a star, like Mary Pickford. (lively piano music) - I don't think any of us felt that we really had to be actresses in it. We just thought we were going to be advertising the town. (laughs) (lively piano music) - Well, they were, she was a very good friend of mine. She was born here, too, in Wausau. I had a surprise when she decided to do this 'cause she was sort of, not shy, but, they were married, you see, she and Hans, I think in 1913. - [Stephen] So they had just been married? - Yeah. In fact, she wore her wedding dress and all. I can remember seeing them coming down out of the Yawkey Hall, that's where she was supposed to live, and Mr. Jones was her father, G.D. Jones. - And of course, we think our father, was Wausau, so when you asked us over the phone "How did your father happen to be in on the action," and what was going on, we just had to look at each other and laugh. - Everybody liked him. He didn't try to be somebody socially, but he just was liked, socially, because he was friendly to everybody, and interested in them. - He was a lawyer for Weyerhaeuser and a lot of places not in Wausau. He wasn't dependent on Wausau, but he loved it and he loved that Wisconsin River, and he, I suppose you might say, was somewhat of a promoter for anything that he really was crazy about. - 1914, oh. (bubbly piano music) - [Stephen] Sympathy, what did that sound like? - Oh, loved it. Rudolph (drowned out by upbeat piano music). Oh, that was one of my favorites. Just like ... ("When You Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose") Here it is. There we have it. ("When You Wore A Tulip And I Wore A Big Red Rose") And they played classical things. You know, for the movie. Something like this, dripping willows over a pool or a pond. Like this. (serene piano music) - [Logger] Well, I'm sure different people know about it, but still, there's the knack of getting it out. There's a lot of headaches involved and still, it's a lot of hard work. Darn hard work. (lively piano music) (indistinct conversation) - Then, of course, there was such a thing as sentimental playing. You know, everything was very sentimental and you could get that by different inflections in your music. - [Stephen] Can you give an example? (dramatic piano music) - I often wonder what it was really like in this country, if I can find this much that was left behind. I woulda liked to seen what was being put down this river. I can't visualize 200 million feet of logs comin' down a river at one time. - [Voiceover] Here's a pretty big one. - Keep 'em lined up with the same pulling line. - You have to be somewhat of a sentimentalist, I think, to play for a movie. - Got a nice pine on here now. Dandy. The pine is the more trustworthy. Out of maybe 100 logs, I can pull up 99 pine, and they're all good. And out of 100, I can pull up maybe maybe 50 hemlock, and they're not all good. For some reason or another, they don't have the pitch in them, and underwater, they don't stay preserved as well. - [Stephen] How long do you think this has been in the water? - Well, this log has been sawed off. So, the latest it could be in the river is anywheres from 1876 till the present. 1876 to 1904. - [Stephen] Why 1904? - Because that's about when they stopped logging on the Wisconsin River, in 1904. It was the last year of their log drives. So the logs would have to be in here, at the minimum from 1904. - Yeah, well, where do you want to begin? - [Stephen] Why don't we begin, I ask you what you got to show me? - Alright. - You invited me over here to show me something. If you can pick it up and we can take a look at it. Why, we could put it up on the counter here and see what it is. So, you're sort of cleaning up after the lumberjacks, then, what they've left? - Yeah, it's amazing. The lumber barons all became millionaires and for 20 years, I've been pulling out what they left behind. - Well, this is the original print of The Lumberjack. Or, a copy of the original print of The Lumberjack. - [Stephen] Certain exactly what we have here? We can read a couple of the labels here. I'm kind of curious to what they-- - [Robert] Look for the date. That's one, is there a date at all on it? - [Stephen] There's a caution. "Do Not Drop." Let's see. "Keep Cool, Flammable." This must be a 35 millimeter, then. - This was the 35 millimeter surviving copy, which was stored in the vault at the Wausau theater until Frank Welter, who had been the manager, and was a close friend of my father's, died. And at that time, it was moved to the Employer's Mutuals, and stored in my father's, in the closet off my father's office. He was then president of the company. - So this would probably be, if this is an original copy, this would have been 1914, maybe? And then, you think that the film was stored at the Grand Theater here in Wausau? - I do know that it was in the theater in the late 20s because there was a private showing and I was ordered to attend. I was going to junior high school at the time. - [Stephen] Who ordered you to attend? - My parents. No one else ordered me around. (laughs) - Well, maybe you better explain the connection of your parents to this movie, then? - Well, Mother and Dad, of course, were the hero and heroine in The Lumberjack. They were the patsies when the traveling movie people came to Wausau and convinced someone in the community they needed some publicity. - Well, Hans was a, he hadn't been here too long. I think probably three or four years. - [Stephen] Well, he was just starting out with the Employer's Mutual Company. - That's right, that's right. And he certainly made good, but you could just tell that he would. (laughs) - They probably approached him first and made him feel he ought to do it. And he persuaded Helen. - Oh, he would have to persuade Mrs. Hagge? - I think so. - I can imagine that would be true, because she had a stubborn nature. She had a, you know, a mind of her own. And she did or she didn't do what she thought she should do. - I had never heard much about it from my family. But, I know they were the hero and the heroine because I've seen the movie. - In fact, it was sort of hard to even see it. I remember they, I think they showed it at, was the Grand here then? I guess it was. - [Stephen] The Majestic. - Was that where they showed it? The Majestic? - That was on third street, wasn't it? Oh, in the Majestic. Well, I wasn't in Wausau when this was done. I was just out of Vassar College. I graduated from Vassar in 1914 and went on a house party immediately and so, and I had forgotten how long it lasted, but apparently, till after this was over. I really didn't hear much about this when we got back. Now, maybe some people that, who weren't in it, feelings were hurt and didn't talk and other people thought they shouldn't talk. I don't know. Very peculiar. I heard, of course, about the granite works. - Why, I don't think they were doing anything real special. Dad didn't talk much about that, but he didn't feel good about it. He said he told us all, they could take pictures, but they should find some shelter, or, you know, 'cause you never know what's gonna happen, you know, when you make a blast like that. - Those people that were in that movie knew about it and told us about it and Father spoke of it in a sober way when he came to dinner and indicated that a tragedy had occurred and that it was very sad. - Minor. Anything that was minor was sad, So then I'd go into minor. - He didn't let it (sad piano music) make him feel that anybody should be strictly blamed for it, that it was a mistake of some sort that was a very unfortunate event and that it was terrible that it had happened in the middle of this picture. - Leave it in minor. - I think the Hagges showed it somewhere afterwards. But then it was damaged somewhere or other and sort of thought we never would see it again. - Now, they may have edited it before this late 20s showing, in which I think a number of the people who were involved were invited to a 4:00 meeting at the Grand Theater. I, too, was invited, but I got there late and as I remember, my idea of a movie was Take Town Mix, or something like Hood Gibson and this was pretty dull and I was very unimpressed. - [Stephen] Perhaps not quite as polished as the Hollywood productions you were seeing. - Spoiled, it spoiled a good afternoon of playtime after school. - I couldn't call it much of a business. It is a hobby. More or less a hobby. It's interesting to me. I'm interested in what I find in the river. Pine, hemlock, tamarack, find the stamps on the end of the logs. Sometimes check on a date, see how far they go back. Each company had their own stamps and each company owned their own logs. So, they stamped 'em accordingly that when they floated 'em in the spring of the year, that there was no fights between the different companies, who owned what. Each had his own brand. There was the Alexander Mills, Brooks and Ross, Plummer Mills, Stone Lumber Company. There were various ones just in this particular area. But these logs were floated, well, probably from the Michigan line, some of them, all the way down, Steven's Point, through that area. - [Stephen] So, they've traveled a lot of miles in a lot of years. - Oh yeah, they've traveled a lot of places already. - Dad died in '59 and it was taken from his office, where it had been since '46 and it's been sitting in this room in the very spot where I picked it from since we moved in here in January of 1965. - I probably would watch a few bars, you know, the picture first, then when I caught the emotion or the mood of it, then I would start. And it really wasn't too important if it was exactly, but you can tell. There's a mood to each picture. - When you had this stored over at the, your father's office. How about something mysterious? - Oh. - [Stephen] Would mystery have its own sound? - Minor again. (mysterious piano music) - You said it was in a special place at the old Employer's Insurance building. - Originally, it was put in the vault on the first ground floor of the, what is now City Hall. I think that they felt that that was the relatively fire resistant room and if it exploded-- (dramatic piano chord) as the warnings tell you it might, not much damage would occur. - You had to put the audience in the mood. Course, they were pretty much in the mood anyway, watching the picture. But you were to reinforce that emotion. - Well, most movies in 35 millimeter prior to 1950 were printed on what's called nitrocellulose. If this is, nitrocellulose film stock? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, that film-- - [Stephen] Explain what it is first. - You could look at it on a hot day and it would explode. It was terrible stuff and it didn't keep very well, either. The motion and all would deteriorate very quickly, so, they're very fragile, and they were very poor all the way around. Awful, poor stuff, you know. Didn't take much to set it afire. - I've never opened it. I've never been curious enough to see what's in there. - Okay, now that he pulled 'em out, I'll truck 'em outta here. I'll get a big truck. I'll take 'em up to my sawmill and start sawing them into lumber. - [Stephen] And logs that have been under the water for 70, 75, 80 years, you can use 'em for lumber? - Yeah, I can use 'em for lumber. Because anything that the air can't get to can't rot. They can become water soaked, but as far as really rotting? No, they can't. They're under water, the air can't get to 'em. You have to have the air to decay things. So, they're in a perfect state of preservation. - [Stephen] Things like this are, I think I have some problems with deterioration. - It's a miracle that it survived. What little is left in there, it's a miracle that the case is still here. 'Cept it is just kinda pretty. - Even these logs here today, not many people could afford to buy the lumber out of 'em. A lot of this stuff is clear pine, not a knock in it in 16 to 24 feet. You've heard of knotty pine. Well, that would be just the opposite. No knots, clear, number one select. - [Stephen] That's part of the same tree that built houses in Wausau 70, 80, 90 years ago? - Undoubtedly. (laughs) Undoubtedly. - [Stephen] Well, would you mind if we take a-- - No, open it up. - I brought along some gloves, so, to handle it, I thought I would-- - Alright. (ominous piano music) - Sensing the danger. (ominous piano music) - [Stephen] I'm glad you're confident that it's not-- - I think I'd rather stand up and look over your shoulder so if I have to move, I can. - You can't just mill it out like you would a player piano. So I think that's one reason they didn't call in player pianos. It had to be a certain amount of emotion from the player. You had to give this sentimental quality, this exciting quality. You know, when there was a fire or a horse race or something. Then you had to apply it. (fast-paced dramatic piano music) - [Robert] Well, it looks pliable. - [Stephen] Yeah, it looks in very good condition, if this is-- - [Robert] Well, no one has played with it. - [Stephen] My god, look, it's tinted. It's a tinted print. - [Robert] Oh my god, wow. - [Stephen] We can do this in color. It's green! - [Robert] It looks pretty tough. - [Stephen] Do you remember seeing any silent movies that were tinted? - [Robert] No. - Well I have, they're beautiful. Beautiful color effects. You see that, Mike? - Well, of course, in those days, there was no natural photographic color, and the path, they did some hand coloring of film but mostly, if you wanted a color, merely tinted was all you see. Now, we found out a source of burline and aniline dye. Oh, it was very powerful stuff. A teaspoon full would color a whole tape full of water. It was so powerful. So we then, after we got the film developed, fixed, and washed, we just put it down in the dye, you see, and dye the whole thing. - I can see other tints. Looks like red scenes. Possibly blue scenes. - [Robert] Probably a nightmare. - Blue, just a little blue, represented a night scene. They still do that today, even. That'd be a night scene, see, but it'd be taken out in the sunlight, so it'd have the strong shadow, don't you see, representing the moonlight, you know. Strong shadows would tell you that there bright sunlight in the daytime, then tint it blue, so it'd look like moonlight, see, at night. - This is a real find. Would you mind if I clipped off a frame from the front of this without risking anything else other than the first title? - [Robert] No, I'll get you some shears. - I think I have some in my pocket here. - [Robert] Just happened to bring some along? I always carry 'em with me. - [Stephen] Okay. - [Robert] I don't think it'll hurt to touch it. I can read Lumberjack. Turn it right side up, it turns out even clearer. Paragon, Feature Film Company. - The same company has pictured Kansas City, Topeka, Galveston, Montgomery, Austin, New Orleans, Mobile, and other large cities. Well now, this particular company, I did not know of, but I knew of several others, you see. And the company my brother and I started ourselves. In those days, I was working in a theater in Austin, running a picture machine, and my brother was working in another one. And over one of these picture shows, we had our studio, where we built all our equipment, set it up to make film. - [Stephen] What year would this have been now? - That was along about 1913. 12, 13, along in there. - [Stephen] So very close to the time of the production of this movie in Wausau. - About the same length of time, yeah. Then several other companies doing the same thing, you know. - [Stephen] They weren't exactly what we would think of as Hollywood companies, but small, independent. - It was the new thing, you know, and everybody trying to get in on it, see. - I found it in a daybook, otherwise I wouldn't have known, 1926. - [Stephen] This is your diary? - Yes, diary notes. - [Stephen] Could you explain? - July 1926, at noon, Mildred Smith called. I can't remember who she was, probably the manager of the theater. Called and wanted me to play at the movies. I consented. Enjoyed playing, dashes. I enjoyed playing for the show. It was the Million Dollar Girl. The piano is good too. I got a dollar and a quarter for playing. (piano trill) I worked with a violinist. And they also had an organ at this theater, but it was a small town as I say, and it wasn't a terrific organ, but she played the violin, and of course, I had to play what she wanted. Then it was music and, music that we had to read. (animated piano music) - I'll get this off to California just as soon as I can. There's something else I'd like to do with you if you'd like to come in. If you have that print, I can find out real fast if it's nitrate. Okay, now if this is nitrate, this ought to really be like a flash powder. I'm gonna be careful with my fingers here. That is nitrate. - [Robert] Well, we got through. We got off lucky. - [Stephen] We got off lucky that it's still in such good condition. - [Robert] No, that nobody got hurt over the years. That point that you clipped, of course is in the outside. - [Stephen] Yeah, well we'll have to find out now. We'll have to unroll it. I'm going to talk to Larry Bells over at the Grand Theater and see if he'll let me work in his projection room, which is fire proof. What kind of a career did this lead you to in the movies as a movie player? - Ah, I wouldn't call it career. I was just somebody to call on when they needed music. And it wasn't too soon after that that the sound came in. But, I was just handy to call, "Would you come and play for a movie?" So I was glad to. (romantic piano music) - I know that when I'm dead and gone, this river will still be givin' up these kinda logs. They're hidden all over. Every year a new crop comes up from ice high water. It digs 'em out. (dramatic piano music) - Take her, my boy. May you live long and prosper. Now, that was GE Jones. That sort of sounds like him. And he was probably told to say it. - Take her, my boy. That sounds like father. - [Stephen] And there he is on the left. - Yeah, oh yeah. That's when he decided to let them get married after all. - Wedding bells, now here they come. I wish I knew who those little flower girls were. They probably, quite old now. - [Ellen] Well, I bet these youngsters were thrilled. - [Hester] Now watch these children. Maybe-- - [Ellen] They did very well coming back. - [Hester] Maybe right after the children, we may recognize-- - That's Helen and Hans, the bride and groom. - That's Hans and Helen. - [Stephen] The Hagges. - [Ellen] Now, Catherine Bissel was supposed to be-- - That's Catherine Bissel, I think. And I don't know who she was with. - Well, I just don't see them that clearly. I'm just too blind. - [Stephen] It's very hard to see on this black and white print. - Yeah. - [Stephen] Unfortunately. - [Hester] That looked like Orpha. - [Ellen] That might have been Orpha. - That's Orpha Collie, and Ralph Collie. Don't go so fast. - I'll back it up for you. - [Hester] Now, remind me, who the wedding party people were. - [Ellen] I don't know, watch. Watch! He's doing his. - [Hester] I mean tell me their name so I can see the-- - [Stephen] Lawrence Gilberts and Bob Evans. - [Hester] Yeah. - [Stephen] Ralph Collie. And your sister Orpha Collie. - [Hester] That's Catherine Bissel, I think, behind Helen Hagge. - [Ellen] That's what I thought. - Bissel. - That's Catherine Bissel. And I don't know who she's with. But that's Orpha and Ralph Collie. - [Hester] You probably realize that my sister Orpha really was very beautiful. - They look familiar. That's ... I think that's Florence Gilbert. And the next one is there. - [Stephen] Let's back you up. - [Ellen] Isn't that funny? - [Hester] Goin' backwards is-- - [Ellen] Now you do see them better. - There, I think I, There I think I am. Oh! - [Hester] I did, I saw-- - [Stephen] Florence Evans there? That's you there. - [Florence] Yeah. - [Stephen] And with you? - Was my husband, my fiance, Albert Murrell Evans, known as Bob. - [Stephen] And it wasn't too long after this that you had your own wedding. - No, I was married in September 1, 1915. (upbeat piano music) - Well, in this, as a group, where people who had made Wausau their life, had been there, lived there, and had made it what it was. - Hans and Helen Hagge are-- - Gone. - And the father of the bride, GD Jones. - Oh yeah, long. - Mark Scofield. - Yeah. - The mother of the bride, Mrs. Bird. - Oh yes, years ago. - Catherine Bissel, maid of honor. - Uh-huh. - In society, they were among the high society of the town. There weren't any people that were higher society. They were just people that knew each other very well, and who were making good in Wassau. - I don't imagine they are living. They are older than I am. - Mr. and Mrs. Collie? - They've both died. - Mr. and Mrs. Fe Marshall. - They died. - Mr. and Mrs. Guy Gooding. - Yes, but, yes the ones that were in the wedding. He married again, and his wife is living, but she wasn't in the wedding. She came here from across. - So, you are the last surviving cast member of the movie. - I'm the last leaf on the tree. - [Stephen] What would you do with your music, say at intermission? I presume there were-- - Oh I, that was a nice time to play. I don't know how many reels they had, but you waited until they got it strung up or ready, whatever they had to do. Then we would play it. - [Stephen] Would you see the slides on the screen, "Pard, excuse us while we change the reel." - Yes, oh ads. I had forgotten, ads. But your ice cream at Rebenald's Corner Grocery or whatever. Great big bright colored ones. But that would look nice if you ... (playful music) Buy your ice cream here. I liked that, that was fun. And of course the manager let us do anything we want to. We were strictly the ones in control. Sometimes I would strictly ... (dramatic music) Then this. Or, if I want to. (upbeat music) The piano keyboard is yours. - It has a nice sound. - Okay. (upbeat piano music) - Pretty names, aren't they? - Norwood, I like that. (light-hearted piano music) - Used to be lots of 'em. - [Stephen] That would be the two of them. Do you know what building that is back there? - Well, that's Jones' house up on the hill. - That's our house, Hester. Look at it, Hester. - Ah yes it is. - He was a lawyer. He was a president of the school board. There's a school here named after him, GD Jones School. Now, where's that for heaven's sakes? - [Stephen] This is at a saw mill, but I was wondering if you might be able to tell me which one. - [Florence] Well, it must have been Barker Stewarts. - [Stephen] That must be GD Jones there, that fellow right there. - [Florence] Yeah, it looks like him, uh-huh. - Well, they took his hat off? - Oh, father without a hat on. I remember that hat. - Mr. Norwood, what? This is my wife and daughter, will you kindly show them through the mill? Oh, that must have been Barker's. Well, you see that, that's all advertising, isn't it? That's pretty good. - [Stephen] So, not only did you play music, but you would've made sound effects-- - [Louise] Oh, yes, yes you could to a certain extent. - [Stephen] If you saw a particular object on the screen in the movie and you wanted to match or make a sound? - [Louise] Oh, yes, you mean like a steam whistle or something. - [Stephen] Yes. - [Louise] Oh, yes, I think so. The train is coming to the station, okay? (train chugging music) Bells, that was the ... You could always do that. - [Stephen] How does the train leave the station? - [Louise] Oh, that's easier, they just reverse the process. (train chugging music) - [Ellen] Here come the logs. Journey took a strong engine. - We just took it for granted that logs came through the town all the time. - [Stephen] Well, they've had their tour of the mill. - [Florence] Mr. Norwood, we would be glad to have you call on us in the near future. That's a good old car. A few nights later. This is over at the Yawkey house. That beautiful garden there, well it just, the fountains, you see it all there. That's lovely. That's Hans and Helen sitting by. They arrange to go to Rothschild Park the following Sunday. They're gonna show 'em everything, aren't they? The following Sunday. Now, that's in front of the Yawkey home, you see. - [Stephen] So, that must be Hans and Helen getting in the car. - That was a Sunday afternoon, I remember. We went down and we were in the launch, giving the bride an groom a ride in the launch, with the wedding party. It was all those dig ole launches, you know. - Well, my father and mother, they wanted to see the log rolling contest and boat races. He hitched up the horse and buggie and me and my brother, my dad and mother and two sisters came down here. - [Stephen] How old would you have been? - Well, I was born in 19 three, I was around 11, between 11 and 12 years old. - At the park, they witness the races. Oh, I'm glad they got this. - [Stephen] So you may have been on one of these boats? - We were in a big, quite a big launch. It might have been. And there was a bridge that people were standing on, watching and-- - We was all watching it. Had a regular party, had ice cream and cake and regular picnic. - The building in the background? - [Florence] Uh huh. - [Stephen] What is that? - [Florence] That's the pavilion. - [Stephen] And what did you do there? - Well, we roller skated and danced, we had dances there. And it was really a wonderful place to go. It was owned by the electric company. They were very strict about it. No liquor or anything could be on the premises. - [Stephen] Were you known to sneak it in from time to time? - No, oh my land, no. (laughs) I was brought up very strictly. (laughs) - [Clyde] I wasn't much for the boat racing, but I liked to see the log rolling. It was a miracle the way them guys could roll that log and both of them stay on it and one would jump up in the air, and he'd stop the log and the other one, he'd catch himself and finally, one ducked the other one. - [Florence] Now, there were a lot of people sitting back there-- (Florence and Stephen talking at once) - Yeah, that was right over there on the bank. And I see when the boats went through. - And just as we got under the bridge-- - Yeah, they were standing on a bridge or something. (piano trilling) Chattering. - [Florence] I see them. They're all waiting, see there, on that bridge. See, they're going-- (dramatic piano chord) See them all fall into the river? That railing broke. - [Stephen] I see brave souls going in after the ones who are down there. - To the rescue, I guess. (laughs) (dramatic piano music) - I know a lot of people were in the water. Some people drownded. Kinda spoiled the whole thing, you see. - [Florence] There's Haas and Helen-- (lively piano music) Oh, they're feeding the deer. - [Stephen] Would this have been in the pavilion park area? - I think so, near it. Now there's the Yawkey House again. (lively piano music) They arrange to visit Wausau's points of interest a few days hence. Let's see if he, she lives there, I'm sure. But he didn't even walk in with her. (laughs) (lively piano music) - Is that the bride again? - [Ellen] They're doing it altogether. They don't-- - [Hester] Let's see if we can, is that the church? - [Stephen] YMCA, I believe. - [Ellen] Oh yeah. That looks familiar. - [Hester] They have a new one now. - [Ellen] Is that a bank? - [Florence] I think when it was like that, I think it was called a German American Bank. - [Stephen] This was 1914, again, before the war. - I think they changed the name after the war. - Because, yes, okay. - [Florence] That's the old post office. - [Stephen] You know where this was located? - [Florence] Yeah. Scott Street and Forest Street. And right across from it, now that's the Trust Company. - [Stephen] Where the Chamber of Commerce is now? - [Florence] That is it, but that used to be the, it was built as a trust company. That was quite nice, the courthouse. Too bad they tore that down. That's the City Hall. - [Stephen] Can you read the sign on top? - Well I, Work for Wausau, probably. - Work for Wausau. Well, I remember that Work for Wausau sign was now the topic of the day in Wausau. Everybody was talking about it, including Father. And they were very much interested in the fact that they had decided to have this, that other towns were finding ways to advertise their towns to the world. But this idea of putting up a sign, a great big sign, was the one that they thought of in Wausau. And it would be a big electric sign and it would be made beautiful with all kinds of special decorations and extra ways of having the lights flaming and so forth and an eagle on top and it would be where people coming in from any direction would be sure to see it, because it was high and big and starkingly attractive. - Yes, I remember that, and I remember a lot of us didn't like it. So, finally, they took out some of the letters, and had it Work for USA. - [Stephen] That must have been, then, a little later. - I think it probably was near the war. - [Hester] But it gave people something to think about and do, rather than just, isn't Wausau nice? It gave people a feeling of being proud of making it nice. - But you two ladies, you went off to college at Vassar and you moved away. Wausau didn't work for you, or? - Well, life didn't ... Nobody had any real future plan. There wasn't women's lib, and there was no plan for women. They were supposed to stay home until they finished high school, and then get married. And that was the general rule. - The idea of women going into business in any way, that was looked down on for women. - But we wanted to go to college, and so we did that, and we had our old boyfriends of people that we met through the dances in high school, but there weren't any of 'em that were the type that either one of us particularly felt a ... A congenial, you know, a personal, congenial feeling for. We liked them, but we didn't have a personal feeling for them. And so, we didn't, they didn't ask us to marry them and we didn't expect them to. (laughs) - The idea was to make at out of life yourself, and not be dependent upon a man or to be dependent on getting married. If you got married, or riding so forth, you see. So, it was a different situation. - [Stephen] Well, it seems to ironic to me that your father worked so hard to keep young people in Wausau and there was-- - Well, he didn't want 'em all to stay there, but he didn't want 'em all to go away. He didn't care if some of 'em went away, but he didn't want 'em all to go away and the town to die. - And there weren't opportunities and interesting jobs for women and I wanted mostly to get out and look around. ("When You Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose") - Now, that's the library. It certainly changed. Is that coming down from the library? - [Stephen] That's a good shot of-- - [Florence] Helen and Hans, yeah. Well, that's the Keebler factory. Sash and Door factory, and-- - [Stephen] Curtis? - Or, is that Curtis? Maybe it's Curtis. Is the same kind of a factory. - [Stephen] And this be Underwood Veneer. Where were they located, do you remember? - They were over on the west side, over near where Conner's are now. Not many people could give all this history. (laughing) - [Stephen] Now, they're gonna take a look at the city, I believe. See those in the background? It's sort of a pan of the river to ... - [Florence] That's the saw mill. - [Stephen] Yeah, it would be a lumber mill on Washington Street. - That's probably the Alexander Stewart Saw Mill. And there's the Big Bull Falls. - [Ellen] The very famous falls. Believe me, they were called Big Bull Falls. - Yeah, Father just loved that river. And when I was a little girl, he used to take me on his handlebars every Sunday morning and we drove across the river and we stopped on the bridge and looked over and he had a little thing he always said. "Hello, river." And then I used to say, "Hello, river." It was a lovely river. (lively piano music) - [Ellen] The Country Club. And that, too, was different. Where are they rushing? I don't know who all they had playing golf. But people were wearing long dresses down to the ground to play golf? Well, now, no, they're doing something different. - [Stephen] That's a great touring car. Do you know who owned that? - [Florence] No, mine was just a sport model. I did have a car. - [Stephen] There must not have been many cars in the city at that time. - No, I think I was the first woman driver in the city. (laughs) - [Stephen] No kidding? - (laughs) My father gave it to me 'cause he didn't want me to go to college. Didn't want me to spend four years away from home. - [Stephen] So, he gave you a car to race around Wausau instead of going to college? - That took him a lot of heirs, too. I had a Cadillac sports model. (laughs) I wish you could see it. (lively piano music) They plan to visit her brother's granite plant. That's where this man gets killed, hit by a piece of granite that they were blasting. - Were you out at this location? - No. They didn't take us out on all these things. - [Stephen] But you heard about it going and what had happened? - Yes, everybody was upset already, about him being killed. (ominous piano music) - [Stephen] Do you remember what happened? - I remember that very distinctly, when that happened that day. - [Stephen] How did you learn about it? - [Louise] Through my brother. And all these guys. You know, they all stopped at our house to eat. - [Stephen] Now, all these men worked with your brother, out at the quarry. - With my brother at the quarry and they boarded it at our house. That's my brother, Herman Weinkauf. He was the one that didn't want that shadow blast because he was afraid those loose stones might strike him, strike some of 'em. - [Stephen] Do you remember very clearly about how the quarry looked about 1914? - Oh, yes. I remember it real well. - [Stephen] You must have gone out there. - Oh yes, we used to to out there to pick berries. There were oodles of red raspberries and in that deep hole, about 85 feet deep, they claimed it for us. I don't know if it was that deep or not, - [Vernon] I've been lookin' in the house at home and thought we had more pictures of Dad and the quarry. I haven't found 'em yet. - I would guess it was a little bit different than now. - Yeah, it was different. There were five derricks, four or five derricks around here, but wooden. Masts and booms. (somber piano music) And there probably were 14, 15 men working here all the time. - [Stephen] Do you have any idea what some of the stone was used for, back say around World War I or a little bit before? - Well, a lot of it was for building, like the old courthouse. The Plumer building. That had a lot of granite in it. That's torn down now, too. - [Stephen] I would guess this was not easy work. - No, it wasn't. 'Cause everything was done by a slower method than they have now. Drilled lots of these stones by hand like I showed you with a hammer and a drill, and stroke 'em with wedges. And they had steam hoists here, instead of gas motors or diesel motors. - [Stephen] Did you ever see the movie that they made up here at the quarry then? It was shown down in Wausau. - That I never saw. - I think we asked him. He never said much about it. Dad was a, I don't know, he was all quiet about something like that. Didn't say too much. - [Stephen] Well, I imagine he was pretty upset about what happened. - Yeah, he was, he was. He was one that said to the fellow seek some shelter before he took the picture. And they thought it'd be alright, but it wasn't. He got, he was killed. To me, I don't even know the man's name. You said you know it. - [Stephen] Well, you aunt remembered. - [Louise] Normenthal? - [Stephen] Rosenthal? - Oh, Rosenthal, yeah, yeah. He came out to take the pictures. - [Stephen] Well, I have some pictures here. - Yeah. - [Stephen] I'm wondering if you could look at that and tell me if either of those pictures could have been taken on that day when they were making the movies our at your father, or your brother's quarry. - [Louise] I don't recognize him. - [Stephen] Does that look like it might have been the quarry? - It looks that way. It looks could, that could be. - [Vernon] Well, it could have been, mmm-hmm. Is that the guy that got killed? - [Stephen] No, it was a friend of his that got killed. - [Vernon] Oh, a friend of his. - [Stephen] This was the cameraman. - You know from what studio? - [Stephen] Well, yeah, they were from a studio in Omaha, Nebraska called Paragon Feature Film Company. I don't suppose you've ever heard of that? - No, not that, I didn't hear of, and now I wouldn't remember it. Well, what I can see, this is on top of the quarry. I know it's level there. - It does, it looks like it's stinkin' and old. - [Stephen] What's the oldest section of this quarry? Do you remember, off hand? - Well, I think it's back here. That's pretty old section there, too. 'Cause what I remember-- - [Stephen] You remember this from a newspaper article? About this event? - [Louise] And I used to save that, but I don't know. I can't find it. - [Stephen] Is this maybe the article you had? Can you read? Can you read that there? - Killed at the quarry. See, it says, Ed Rosenthal, secretary and treasurer of the Paragon Film company, which is taking the moving pictures of Wausau, was killed instantly this afternoon at the Wienkauf quarry, northeast of this city. He was watching a blast explode and a piece of rock struck him in the heart, causing instant death. He was about 62 years old, and his home was at Topeka, Kansas. All in there. - [Stephen] That's what you remembered what happened, hmm? - [Louise] Mm-hmm. That's what I remember. And I remem-, I can picture him. He wanted those pictures. And he wanted to make it a shallow blast, only so that the stones would fly, you see. - [Stephen] What kind of stone was it? - [Louise] Red granite. - [Stephen] Do you know what they used it for? - [Louise] Monuments, mostly monuments. (piano playing funeral march) - [Stephen] Well, did Mrs. Hagge talk to you about this? - Well, they all came. I think they felt almost like ending the picture, because they were all so upset about it. But they went on. They hadn't been married, you see. (somber piano music) (dramatic piano music) (marriage march music) (dramatic piano music) - When our hero, Jack Norwood, returned with his bride, he might have expected to inherit his father-in-law's saw mill. ("When You Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose") The saw mill that was featured in our hero's romance was Wausau's very real Barker and Stewart Lumber Company. On September 22, 1914, during the same week as the Lumberjack's Wausau premier, the Barker Stewart Lumber Company sawed its last log. But the role of our hero was played by Mr. Hans Hagge, and in 1914, Hans Hagge was the general manager of a newly formed, Wausau based insurance company. Had the 1914 filmmaker's moved their camera just slightly to the right, they would have photographed the building that has become Wausau's most familiar landmark. (upbeat electric music) Hans Hagge became president and chairman of the board of the Employers Mutuals, now called the Wausau Insurance Companies. And what became of the makers of The Lumberjack, the Paragon Feature Film Company? Well, according to the moving picture world, which was a trade journal for movies of the era, the Paragon Company was just one of many small film companies traveling from town to town, producing what were called home talent movies. Now that same journal reported that in July of 1915, a year after the making of The Lumberjack, the Paragon Company was working in Springfield, Illinois. Now, their work there was seen by one Springfield resident who was especially fascinated by the new moving picture business. He was the poet, Vachel Lindsay. Lindsay's book, The Art Of The Moving Picture, was first published in 1915, and in it, he does mention the home talent movie that was made in his hometown. "Springfield dressed its best and acted with fair skill. "However, The Mine Owner's Daughter was, "at best, a mediocre photoplay." The Paragon Feature Film Company went out of business in 1917. The bizarre death of Paragon's secretary treasurer, Edward Rosenthal, makes it possible for us to know the names of all the men who made The Lumberjack. Edward Rosenthal's death certificate was signed by O.W. Lamb. Oliver William Lamb directed The Lumberjack. Rosenthal had come to Wausau in order to watch his film crew make the final scenes of the movie. Together, they were to travel to Chicago for the wedding of the Paragon Company cameraman. That cameraman, William Lou Gullett, was married in Chicago, three days after Edward Rosenthal's death. The record of cameraman Gullett's marriage led me to his adopted daughter. She sent me the pictures of her adoptive father, which may have been taken at the site of the granite quarry accident. The Paragon filmmakers are all long dead. But they survive in The Lumberjack. And by that I mean, they are literally in their own movie. Now, they're not easy to see, but Miss Hester Jones told me where to look for them. - It was on the side of the hill, was called East Hill, that Wausau itself was down in a kind of a valley where the river went through. And on the side of this hill, there were two houses that father spotted and he picked that spot, and he moved those houses and then he built his dream house and that's what he wanted. That house that was moved off and below made a lawn and it was a beautiful lawn from the upper house all the way down to the street. Some friends of ours sent us a globe, which wasn't particularly our type of ornament, but it was a nice thing to have and on that big lawn, it looked alright. And here was this big, mirror globe. - And there they must be. Oliver Lamb directing the actors. Lou Gullett at his camera. And perhaps Edward Rosenthal. All of them, making and remaking forever. The first scene of The Lumberjack. - No, it's really no different than any other lumber, only that it's wet. I pile it like any other lumber 'til it's dry. It's hard to find a better lumber, especially when you can get it for just a little work. - But, I do know where it's been since 1946. But, where it was between the time that the film was made and the Grand Theater opened in '28, I don't know. - [Stephen] Do any of your own movies survive from 1913, 1914? - I don't know. We had a world of film negative, and all kinds of stuff, experimental stuff. And it was just tossed in a box. Nobody thought anything about it, might be worth anything in the future, you know. We didn't know those things. Never thought about 'em. - [Stephen] When did you come into this scene in Wausau? - [Florence] Well, I came in, some time ago. - Would you be willing to tell us when? - Sure, I came in June 19, 1891. - [Stephen] Well, you would have been how old? - Well, let me see, 19-- - [Stephen] About 23? - Well, you'll have to figure that out. - Now, that's right, that's right. And after you say it, then I remember that it was a rags. That's right, I was born in 1886. - [Stephen] Did you father ever see the film that they shot out here? - No, but he never brought any more film takers out there, I don't think. - [Stephen] I wonder what he'd think about us being out here right now? - I don't know. - And all at once, all the people in the water. And you couldn't get down here. They, the cops kept the crowd back, you know. He said, "There's too many of them down there now." - And I had forgotten that ladies wore those big brimmed decorated hats like that around for going around town. - None of these people had been in a movie, or anything like this before, and I think they're doing very well, don't you? - [Hester] Why sure, they look like real actors. - Of course, the motions on the screen were so abrupt. Filming, the photograph, I suppose made it that way. They were choppy. Charlie Chaplin's motions were staccato. And so of course, the music could fit. That was easy. (staccato piano music) He falls down. (staccato piano music) You can take any melody and lend it to whatever it's supposed to be. When I was teaching, I played for marching in school. The kids marched out of school. (lively piano music) And so on. And then we had a new teacher who was strictly popular music, and she played strictly by ear, had had her own stylizing. So when she played it, it was like this. (upbeat piano music) So, there you have, it's style. - [Stephen] I see, you had to feel it yourself. - That's right, you did. I just don't see how anyone could play for movies unless you did. Have to be sort of a harp in the wind, you know? Emotions swing you to play. (playful piano music)
