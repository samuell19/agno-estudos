Open your mouth. Tongue. How was leave, Uri? -Lousy. Avner Hiram, Yoseph Eliazdi, Muhamad Jabar... Turn around. -Prisoners who were called... -Bend down. are asked to report to outside-work officer. Prisoners who's names were called are asked to... -Leg. How's Siggy? Did you find the girl? -No. Other leg. Damari, search his clothes. Don't worry, Uri, it'll pass. She'll go back to Boarding School. Everything will be all right. We're having a party? -Strip and lie on the couch. Lie on the couch or we'll help you lie. If you harm the warden, you won't make it out alive. You weren't here 24 hours, it was peaceful and quiet. I'll see to it that it stays quiet even with you inside. Make them stop the damn enemas, you'll have quiet. You know what you get for threatening a guard? OK, fine, throw him in solitary for a week. Maybe he'll calm down. Don't take it personally, eh? Nothing personal. There. You're going to miss enemas. That'll cost you, you piece of shit! This is Assaf Forman. Cell 16. -Thanks. Fitussi! -What? -The fucker's here. He's here, the bastard. -he's here, I see him. You son of a bitch! -Mother fucker! -Bastard! Cock sucker, maybe we'll be cellmates. Squealer. -You fuck. -Snitch, asshole, come here. You fucking squealer. Shame on you, traitor. Come here, you bastard. -Come on, shit head. Traitor. -Come here, squealer. Damari! Not putting him with us? -The Officer said with Uri. You mother fucker, bastard. -In Uri's cell? You're a traitor to your country. Come here, I'll set you on fire. You bastard, son of a bitch. Damari, you're confused, honey, he doesn't belong here, he belongs there, with the Arabs. -Just for tonight. Just for tonight? What are we, babysitters? He's no baby, he's a ticking bomb. Out of Jews' problems that you're worrying about Arabs? Is there a problem, Damari? -They're not happy with him. Not happy? What, do you want to be on the Prison Housing Committee? Was that a suggestion or a request? Uri! -No, no, if it's a request, we're willing to give it some serious consideration. Keeping your spirits high, eh, Uri? A week in solitary wasn't enough to cool you down? We in the cooling business or maybe in housing business? Uri, don't give me an excuse to cut you down to size. It'd really... hurt me to. Mr. Hershko, let's find him another place anyway, for all our sakes? Mr. Hershko, you're putting here a time bomb, you'll get only trouble. -Trouble? -Yeah. A wise-ass, Eh? Give me the guitar. This isn't cool. Hershko, what's the guitar have to do with it? Any trouble and I'm calling off this whole pain-in-the-ass Festival. We gotta help him, guys. -Help who, this guy? He's not one of us. -How do you determine that? He's an officer in their army. He was in all their wars Against us. He's a Zionist. I reckon that's enough. Is he in jail cause of his Zionism? -They're more manipulative than him. He'll pay 5 years of his life for meeting with our guy abroad. Don't compare them to us. There can never be negotiations. The progressive Israeli is the one leaving Palestine never to return. I admire you for one thing: Everything is clear for you. I don't think... -Listen! You have the same problem as "Gush Emunim". The truth is you don't care about people, human beings. You're interested in slogans, speeches, making history, but not in people, made of flesh and blood. Our problem is that you're the only ones heard in the world. But in this cell, Valeed, and not just in this cell, you must understand, people prefer my "blindness" to your fanaticism. Don't you forget that. Taken, it's taken. I told you it's taken. -You said that's taken. Everything's taken for you, eh, Uri? Take your hands off, stop it, come on. Touch him and you'll have to answer to us. -This isn't Fatah-land. We call the shots here. Uri. What's up, what's up. I'll tell you what's up. "Stars and lucky stars". What a headline, There's not much luck where you are. "The muses are not silent behind the walls", wow, what a headline. Some headline, eh? Say, how were her headlines, the reporter's, eh? Each line, a curve, Each curve superb. Eh, nightingale? "The Central Prison's Nightingale". -Uri. "Shlomo Ben-Abu's friends call him the nightingale. "Recently, a song by the nightingale "has been accepted to the prestigious song festival. "An unprecedented success for a prison inmate. " Girls, girls. Look who's back from the cold. Come in, come in, sweetheart! We'll warm you up a little. This jerk is nothing but trouble, nothing but trouble. Guys, let's open this to discussion... -Open up! -I wanna explain something. Girls, anyone against him opening up? But open wide, so we can all get in. Give us a Middle Eastern chord, C-Flapped! If somebody... If somebody would spit in your soup, what'd you do, huh? You like the East, huh? I'll teach you things you don't know about the East. Starting with Turkey. Guys, cut it out. -For God's sake! Look who's here to help him. From the backdoor, eh? A knife in the nation's back. Uri, why don't you stop it? -Wait, I didn't introduce you two. Mussa, this is Ashaf. -Assaf. -Ashaf. -Assaf. Mussa doesn't trust Arab lovers like yourself, so he's converting. Marrying a Jewish girl. A Jewish pussy can't stand an Arab cock, eh? After the test, what kind of Jew are you gonna be, Sephardic or European? If you get over 80, the Europeans will have you. Stop, stop! Will you get serious for a moment? -Serious? Why? Aren't people serious enough for you here? They are, I just want to tell you that... -Yeah, my turn now. I'll talk now and you shut up. And you better listen carefully, I'll only say this once. Got it? Don't look at me with you eyes, like some kind of angel. You're worse than Issam, that planted a bomb in the central bus station and ran like a chicken. You betrayed the whole country, and there's no atonement for that. You got that? Do you know what I did? -I know everything you did. You... -Yes? -You use me against the Arabs. I think I have the basic right to say what l... Right? -Yes. -You have no right. I'm not through with you. You're lucky you came in a good time for you. Don't worry, nightingale, he's not worth screwing the festival. So now you sit in your corner and ask for permission for each breath. And when the festival's over, we'll come back to you and your friends and make a little musical. Announcement for all convicts on the General Block. As of today, morning line count will begin at 5 a. m. I repeat, morning count at 5 a. m. Work details will begin at 5:30. Work details will begin at 5:30. -Move, give me room. You got a good appetite. Looking for Uri? He doesn't mix with the white. He's ancient history. Not bad, not bad. -Listen, Menashe, about the deal... you asshole, where do you get the best pieces of chicken in the whole joint? You're paying off the Arabs in the kitchen too? Menashe, you know it's not up to me, I invested a fortune in this stuff and it's all be n confiscated, gone. Who cares about your confiscations? And who cares about your trouble? In a day or two, I want the last one here. Hoffman, I'll split your head open, if not. Like kitty litter. -People paid, they want the goods, and don't think they don't ask how you found it right away. But I'm keeping quiet, like a fish, I'm quiet like a fish in a tank. Never mind. I'll take these losses. What am I asking for, Hershko? I just want to bring Salomon back on a dump truck, and put him in smoothly, just like the deal we had till now. And that's it, you won't hear from Hoffman again. I was also thinking... -What, what were you thinking? I've been thinking it wouldn't be wise if other people knew about our relationship. You wanna call someone? -Hershko, I'd have to go to the warden. Fine, do you want me to set you up an interview? Tzipi. -Yes, Mr. Hershko? Never mind. Drugs, Hoffman. They were and will always be here. Neither one of us invented them. They are the prison's oxygen, and my means of controlling you. My way of keeping the peace. Now, go, go on, Hoffman, go to the infirmary. I'll wait till after the festival, then I'll have nothing to lose. What, no "hello"? -Hello. Your'e mad? What about Maha? When is he coming? - We don't exactly know, but we got a room for him and the boy with my father. The whole village's waiting. How's Boarding school? -Fine. Great. What's so great? We went to a work camp in a kibbutz. -Yeah. That's why I couldn't make it And come for the last visit. How was the kibbutz? -Why do you ask? You hate kibbutzim. Lies are what I hate. Siggy, you've got a lot of explaining to do. Explain to me that you ran away from Boarding School. Explain to me in which kibbutz you weren't. explain to me who you've been hanging around with for two weeks. I have nothing to explain. -Siggy, I want you to go back to school. I'm not going back there, Do you understand? I'm not. I got a special leave, the first one I got. I wanted us to be together. Instead I had to look for you all over the country like a tour guide. Believe me, I'm your father! -What kind of father are you? I'll get out, soon. I have a parole hearing coming up. -how'll get out? You don't get a parole for a second time armed robbery. -OK. When will you get out, in 3 years? And for how long will you be out, dad, for how long? -Siggy, Siggy! Siggy! Siggy! Mommy! Mommy! I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead! They're killing me. They're killing me. Mommy! It hurts, it hurts. Quiet there, Quiet! They partied on Doron's ass. The whole commune. What do you say, communist? They all gave their dicks for charity and put them in the slot. We're here 10 years. I haven't seen such brutality yet. Like animals, I'm telling you, these criminals are like wild animals. The way they attacked Doron, The way they jumped on him, it took the medics 3 days to stitch him up. We gotta find him a safe place. So he could sleep at nights. So, what do you say? About your books that were held up by the Education Officer, the packages, I think we'll find a way to get them to you. And, of course, how can I forget Hassan's case. Let's say 70 percent sure he's going to get a transfer to Gaza prison, like you asked, closer to home. Look, if we can help, why not? I always say if we don't hang together, we'll be hung together. What do you say? I'll take him. -There's also a personal matter, which, of course, has nothing to do with my request of you. You wife. A letter through the Red Cross. You have a beautiful wife. The boy looks like you, too. He was born after you got in, huh? It's tragic. A father and son who never met. I ask you, is it worth it? Thank you, Doron. They're already in the country, at my village. She would always say, "I want to know everything about you and I know nothing. "I haven't even been at your village. " We were living in Ramalla back then. We couldn't go back to the village. We were together four months, she hardly ever spoke. Her eyes alone said it all. When they came to arrest me that night, she didn't say anything, but her eyes told me she knows everything. Now she's there, in my village. With our son. "... will be with me all year around, "cause spring is much more than a season, "the spring. The spring. "The spring. " The nightingale, the nightingale... -Good evening, National auditorium. We're here from the central prison, we'll broadcast the final song of the festival, song number 12. As you can see... As you can see, there is great excitement and enthusiasm here, this is the first time a prison inmate's song is in the competition. We would like to extend our thanks to the prison officials... Anyway, we would like to extend our thanks to the prison officials for allowing us to broadcast the song live from the prison itself, and enable the songwriter and his friends... to participate in the joy of the rest of the people of lsrael. And now, without any further ado, song number 12, "Just Your Hand". Written, composed and arranged by Shlomo Ben-Abu, "the nightingale". The nightingale, the nightingale... "A white little house with roses in the garden "in the white dove-cote is the dove. "I'm dreaming now of golden wings "and I fly away to return to you. "Just your hand, comforting and warm, "just your hand, soothing, soft and fine. "Just your hand waits for me, my love, "I'm here alone, I dream of just your hand. "A white little house with roses in the garden "in the white dove-cote is the dove. "I'm dreaming now of golden wings "and I fly away to return to you. "Just your hand, comforting and warm, "just your hand, soothing, soft and fine. "Just your hand waits for me, my love, "I'm here alone, I dream of just your hand. "when I'm here alone, just your hand. "Just your hand, comforting and warm, "just your hand, soothing, soft and fine. "Just your hand waits for me, my love, "when I'm here alone, just your hand. " The nightingale! the nightingale! Bravo! -Thank you. The nightingale! the nightingale! Bravo! -Thank you. That was song number 12, and from the central prison we return the broadcast back to you at National Auditorium. Get on him, get on him! Lift him up, lift him up! The nightingale! The nightingale... From the National Auditorium in Jerusalem, we have just given you by live broadcast, the first part of the 1984 Israeli Song Festival. We will be back with the concluding portion of our program in 30 minutes, now we give you the news. -The nightingale! the nightingale... Good evening, 6 were killed in a terrorist attack earlier this evening 4 of then, one family, a mother, father and their 2 children. The families of the victims have been notified. Our political reporter informs us that the Israeli government has sent a harsh message to the government in Lebanon with a severe warning. Israel will hold the Lebanonese authorities responsible for all acts of terrorism We take you now to our correspondent Zohar Vardi, Who will fill us in on additional details regarding the terrorist attack. Move, move. We are located at the spot where the terrorist attack took place. Army sources have informed us that at this very moment a full-scale pursuit of the terrorist in underway, one of which was killed nearby by an Israeli Defense Forces patrol which was scouting the area. It was on that spot where the terrorists opened fire, killing, as has been mentioned, 6 civilians... -Turn off the sets and disperse the prisoners. -OK. I want all transistor radios confiscated from the cells, I don't want them to hear any outside news. Two one, two one. To my question, will the IDF pursuit the terrorist across the border, Commander General has said that they will pursuit terrorist organizations... Turn off the Television. Quiet! Quiet! Shut your mouths! Quiet! One more peep out of you and You'll be sorry you learned how to talk. Issam, listen carefully to what I am about to tell you. Take your people quietly and slowly out that way. Go ahead! Bastards! Dirty fucking bastards! You're letting them go? -What's That? They are protecting them. You are protecting them? Bastards! Murderers. Child murderers. I won't forget you for that, I'll kill you! Nazis! Nazis! You're all fucking Nazis! -Shut up! Burn! Bastard, what are you doing? What is wrong with you? -Me? You took them out of there like whipped dogs. Fatchi, for less than that, and rightly, you killed a Jewish builder who insulted you, and now you keep silent? Why do you rub your face so hard, water won't erase the stinging stain of his insult, only blood! We'll be back in ten minutes with the Festival results. In the meantime... There have been reports by military sources that the chase after the terrorists is being conducted at this very moment. So far, one terrorist has been killed by an IDF patrol. The attack took place at six p. m. when the terrorists opened fire on a passing trailer van. On that first shooting, 6 civilians were killed. Moments after the attack, security forces and ambulances arrived. Hoffman, listen when I talk to you. Don't worry, they won't touch you. You tell me in time if you get in trouble, it'll be ok. I always do tell you. Hoffman, I can't do nothing to help you if you hide things from me. got it? You guard what Fatchi said? They're going to kill me. To get to you, they have to get through me, right? Hoffman is not our enemy. It is them, the one upstairs who try to make him and his friends our enemy That's how they control us, manipulate us. You, Valeed, do precisely but precisely what they want you to do. You are so absolutely consistent and predictable that the security officer knows just where to hit you to make you serve his ends! You talk about me doing what he wants? Who is it that made all the little deals with him? who knows if he isn't a plant for the security office. Answer me, why are you silent? what did you get in return? You've crossed the line! -Maybe something to do with your wife and son? That's enough, stop it. What's it got to do with man's private affair? We have two alternatives. One is Valeed's: to kill Hoffman. The other is to let it go and not kill him. Who is with me? Announcement for all inmates on the security block, all inmates are requested to turn in any radios in their possession to the sergeant on duty. Any inmates not complying will be subject to disciplinary action... Fitussi, a search! Confiscation, hand in all your transistors. Give me the radio. -We're not listening to the news, believe me. I don't care. -We're waiting for the festival results. Give me 5 minutes just to listen to the festival. -Give me the radio. That song represents you too. -I don't give a shit. Don't touch my radio, don't touch it... I won't give it to you, Uri, do something! -Give me the radio! Leave him alone. Hoffman, where's our radio? Damari, I dreamed you were Santa Claus. Didn't I see a transistor when we came in here? Have a nice night. -Thanks, you mother-fucker. Whatever happens, Nightingale, for us, you are always number one. Where'd you get it from, the transistor, from the Arabs? Fucking commies gave it to you? The Israeli song festival. Third place... -Go take a shower. Performed by the "Brothers and sisters". In second place, for the first time in the history of the festival, straight from prison, "just your hand", lyrics and music... What happened, Nightingale? What's the matter? -Second place. Yes! Yes! Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! What is it, Fitussi, what happened? -I'm dying! All right, I'll go get the medic. -I'm dying. Have a good night, fucker! Go to sleep. -What makes you so sure they murdered Hoffman? Don't get involved in this. -What if it wasn't them? This is justice? There is no justice here. In here, it's either them or us. And you better decide which side you're on. Who is that? Good is great. Guard! Guard! I want a line up count and everybody out for work, no exceptions I want a line up count and everybody out for work, no exceptions bosses too, including Uri. visiting time cut short. No packages and most important no leaves until things quiet down. I'm going to do some re-modeling around here. When Uri and Issam get out of solitary, they won't recognize this place. And you think these sanctions are going to calm things down here? My dear scholar young lady, you must think that I enjoy having to use all these sanctions. You think I enjoy having to clean up the mess made by having your lousy festival here. The Arab political prisoners wouldn't have killed Hoffman, God rest his soul. if it weren't for that lousy festival I said that it would turn out badly! Next. Close your jacket. Alberto, take Manzur back to his cell, no visitors for him. -Why not? According to the new rules, wearing sneakers is not allowed on visitations. You won't permit him visitation because of his shoes? -Shut up, Issam. or I'll cancel your visit, too. Stand quietly. I'll go bring him different shoes. -Alberto, take him out. Wait a minute, what's this, the Gestapo? -Issam, shut your jaw! -Leave him alone Manzur, don't go. Get your hands off. hands off I said, you animal, you son of a bitch. Shut your mouth! -Take your hands off1 -straight to solitary. Manzur, wait a second. Let go. -Straight to solitary. -I'm not going to solitary, I've just got out. Let go. I'm not moving. My parents are here. Get the manager. -Go to solitary and shut up. Issam is not coming down for a visit today. We want to see him. We are already here. -No visit. If that's the case, goodbye then. -Goodbye. Come on, that's enough, lift your head up. I've got a parole board hearing soon, they'll let me out for sure. I'll tell them you said so. They wouldn't disappoint you. What'll we do the day I get out? What'll we do? You'll be outside waiting in a cab. what'll we tell the driver? We'll tell him, just drive, man, drive. What a smile, what a smile. You know, Siggy, sometimes I dream about your smile at night, and in the morning I wake up laughing. You don't believe me? It's ok, dad, I'm not crying anymore. I'm getting out. -Dad, enough with this game, I'm not a little girl anymore. You really think you'll get a parole? -I got a hearing in two months. Start to finish up the visit. Yeah, all right, all right. What's the matter? Siggy, tell me what is it? Come on, don't pay attention to him, tell me, if you don't tell me things I can't help you. -Ok. the visit is over. The visit is over, finish up. -If you don't tell me... Finish up. -I won't know. Uri, I'm asking you to finish the visit. -We got another fifteen minutes, what, What's the matter? -Uri, new rules. But I'm talking. -New rules. Ok. new rules, Siggy... -Finish up. Dad. -It's nothing. -I've asked to finish up. Get your hands off, hands off me, get them off. Get them off! -Dad! Get your hands off. -Dad. Get your hands off. -Dad, dad. Siggy, it's nothing. It's nothing. Hands off of me! Siggy, this is nothing, it's nothing. Dad. Dad. Get your hands off. Get your hands off of me. You bastards, this iron has more feeling than you. In hell, they'd put you in solitary. Mother-fucking bastard. Doron Attiya. -Here. Fatchi Sullivan. Fatchi. -In solitary. Issam Jabarin. -In solitary. Come on, the security officer wants to see you. Their games are too costly, for you and for us. We must do something. Issam, you and me, we ain't in the same tribe. We can't do anything together. Mussa Shoef. -Present. Albala Eliezer -Here, sir. Ben Abu, Shlomo. -Here. Kalee... Kaleev... Yehiel. Stand up straight! It's ok. it's ok. I'm ok. Issam, you know the security officer as well as I do. He's a hard man, a stubborn man. He won't give up. Besides, everybody who was at the festival understands why you killed Hoffman. Admit it. -Would you admit to something you didn't do? Drink, drink your tea, it's good for what ails you. You like fish? These over here were just born. Cute, huh? We separated them from the big ones right away. You know what would have happen if we had left them there together? How long do you think they'd have lasted? Two, three minutes maximum. The big ones would have eaten them right away. That's how it is with fish. Yes, I know it was very rough on you in cell 17 with Menashe. But who got you out of there? You think it was Issam. I got you out. It wasn't easy, believe me, Doron, it was not easy. I had to promise Issam a lot , a lot of things. But because I knew I had to get you out, I promised. So what do you say? You were there in Issam's cell, right? What am I asking, after all? You heard them. That you sign a statement saying you heard them planning to kill Hoffman. How is Boeing? -Good, good. All right? He looks younger every day. Yehiel, Yehiel, give Issam a drug. It's ok. It's ok. It wasn't us who killed Hoffman. -Why should I believe you? If we had decided to kill Hoffman after he spat in Rashid's face at the festival, we would have made certain that every Jew in the block would know it. What is the point of revenge if its perpetrators are unknown? And if it was us, why should we be afraid to admit it? Look at me, I have two life sentences, I'll be here until I die. What do I have to fear of another life sentence? -It's your way. Throwing a bomb and run away. It's like throwing a hand grenade into a fish pond and it doesn't make any difference, as long as you kill some fish. This is a war, and we didn't make the rules ourselves. Planting a bomb on a bus, that's war? -Strafing a refugee camp, that's war? It's like a thousand buses. So who killed Hoffman if not you, who? -I don't know. But I do know who wants you to think it was us. How long does it take you to shower? Don't make the water dirty! -I have soap in my eyes. - 0k. Ok, Let me get in. Give me the soap, give me the soap. Give me the soap. Give me the soap. Fuck you, Gezer. Quit kicking! You see, Ashaf, if you want to watch your ass around here, You have to shower with a yo-yo soap. Uri, Uri, come! Doron, Doron! What happened? -Doron, Doron. Come! Stop throwing the trays! Stop throwing the trays. Fitussi! Stop the tray throwing. What's the matter with you? No eating today. Stop throwing. Stop the throwing... Stop the throwing. Stop... I don't strike with no Arabs. You heard what Menashe said? I look at some of these people who are breaking this strike and I ask myself, maybe they're better than me. Maybe. Who am I anyway? When I was 13 I had enough police files against me to fill a city library. And why, how come? Because where I come from, the only way to be free was to steal your honor back. And it's the same thing in here. Here you can be free, too. To be free means you got a choice. To choose to be faithful to yourself or to play into their hands, to be their stooge. There are two kinds of stooges. Two kinds. One is a stooge who knows he's a stooge; he knows it. The other kind of a stooge is one who sits and eats and stuffs his mouth and chews hush cud like a pig, and only them, upstairs, they know he's their stooge. But he, he doesn't know it. Yesterday morning, we found Doron, near the shower room, hung on a wire. His fist was rolled up tight, like this. Like he was holding on to the last little piece of his life. And there was a note inside his fist. "The security officer wants me to lie and say it was Issam "who decided to kill Hoffman. If I don't lie, "he'll put me back in Menashe's cell. "I can't take it anymore. Tell my mom I'm sorry. "Goodbye, Doron. " I don't know who should say "I'm sorry" to Doron's mother. Maybe the security officer, maybe Menashe. I only know one thing. This strike is us against them. And everybody here has got to choose if he's with us or with them. This strike will be a hunger strike. Only water. A leave strike, nobody goes out on leave. A work strike, nobody goes out on work detail. A visitation strike, nobody meets visitors. And nobody talks to the authorities, only the committee. You'll get nowhere with terror. So go back to your cellblock, calm your people down and break up the demonstration. Sir, this isn't about some privileges. We have proof that directly, or indirectly, prison officials are responsible for a number of deaths on our block. What proof? -Conclusive proof. If you have proof, present it to me and I will deal with the matter. We don't trust you, sir, nor the Security Officer or representatives. We will present our evidence only to an impartial investigative committee. Sir, if someone intends to break our strike by force, we'll turn the whole block into a living torch. And that means, sir, lots of burns and wounded, lots of deaths. And most important to you, sir, lots of explaining to the Minister. Think about it. -Uri. Uri, who are planning to strike with, these political prisoners? Need I tell you who they are? Who is Issam? A murderer of small children, and the others are no better than he is. Don't you understand they're just using you, Uri, don't you get it? They've got nothing to lose. They're all in here for life. But you guys... use your head, Uri, you're an intelligent boy. You guys have a lot to lose, and so do you, personally. Think about your parole Board hearing. And I understand you've got problems at home. I'll arrange a leave for you, right away. They murdered your cellmate, Hoffman, may he rest in peace. Did the Arabs kill Doron, too? What's the problem, fellows, what are you getting worked up for? Let me get them, forcefully, fast. Then we'll get this thing over with, once and for all. Right now we have to be patient, this is a war of nerves. ln two, three days, when the hunger starts to really get to them, the weak will start to crack. Then we start appealing to their emotions. Permit them furloughs, promise parole recommendations. It'll be enough just to give a few of them leaves, for the strike to end. Doctor, are there heavy drug addicts here? -Yes, about ten of them. We gotta stop their methadone supply immediately, they'll be the first ones to crack. "Tell me, white stork, "will you send my regards to my mother? "Oh, mother, you will not know my tears, "my sighs you shall hear from afar, "Oh, mother, you will not know my tears, "my sighs you shall hear from afar, "Oh, mother, you will not know my tears... "my sighs you shall hear from afar, "Oh, mother, you will not know my tears... " Attention all convicts on the Security Block. In 30 minutes, all cells on the block will open. In 30 minutes, all cells on the block will open. Any prisoner wishing to end his strike and transfer a block, will be able to go down to an open transfer room.
