Just push this button, and you'll see Ahhhh, the Websley alphabet book Which contains every single letter of the alphabet. And this is the book's publisher Mr. Websley The Websley alphabet book is filled with all the letters of the alphabet! But now, we need to convince Mr. Websley to make a talking alphabet book!

E F G H How many letters are there?! Only 26 Tad But, maybe you're too little to remember all of them? Why don't you just sit and watch? Too little... just watch... Get lost No! Tad Ahh, I didn't mean it like that. Leap, we need to practice so the presentation will be perfect. Right, Lily. I'll talk to Tad later. If I knew my letters, I could help. Now entering the letter training area. All letters, please report to the training area immediately. Caution: Intense and serious letter training now in progress.

Umm The name is Quigley, Professor Quigley. Nice to meet you. And I'll be happy to teach you your letters. With a foolproof system, developed right here by a very ingenious scientist. Who? Me! In these classrooms, we teach every letter to make its correct sound. Why don't you join the A's, Tad? Wooga Wooga Wooga! AAAAAA Perfect! That was exactly the right sound for the letter A. A: as in ANT Which reminds me. I need to get this monster suit cleaned. What do the A's say? You see my boy? Learning letters is easy. Now you know The A says Ahhh Every letter makes a sound, the A says: Ahhh! Wow! What letter is next? The letter B! Hey, this B forgot one of its bumps. That's a lowercase letter B, Tad And this large one, is called a "Capital B". Each letter can be either a capital, or a lower case. But they both make the same sound. No matter what their shape and size. Bam Bam Bam Bam. Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Hold it, Hold it! I heard a Boom Boom Boom. You are not cannons, You are the letter B! And, the B says: The B says: Every letter makes a sound the B says: It's C C cold in here! This is the C room. C makes the C sound, as in "cold". You are the letter C! And your sound is: The C says: The C says: Every letter make a sound. The C says: Look out! Brrrr! Good thing I wore my long underwear. ooo welcome to the D room, Dadio! I dig your vibes, my main D. And we are here, so the sprout can soak in your message! Crazy! Listen up cool cats. The D goes D as in "Dog" I dig the D. Let's tune in to that crazy poetry. The D says: The D says: Every letter makes a sound, the D says: Well D done, Tadio. Letters, letters, listen up. We really need to impress Mr. Websley! So, I'm thinking of creating an incredible beginning for the presentation! First I need to build a big set with a slide--- Leap! we really don't have time for any changes! Oh, um, OK. Well then, so let's take it from the top! With A B C and D And... action! The A says: The B says: The C says: And the D says: And here's where we use my remote control spotlights. Ahh, help! Ahhhhh! Okay, so maybe uh, we don't use the spotlights. What room is next, professor? My boy, just ask if this is the E room. Um, excuse me. Is this the E room? Ehhh? Is this the E room? Ehhh? This guy is no help! He just keeps saying: Ehhh! That's right Tad! This is our E trainer. He's teaching the sound of the letter E. E as in: "Egg". The E says: The E says: Every letter makes a sound. The E says: Bravo! Perhaps, we had best be going Oh no, This E is missing a line! Actually, that's the letter F! Can we go inside so I can learn what it sounds like? Certainly, but I hope you don't get air-sick... Huh? Alright F letters, prepare for takeoff. Are we going to get on a plane? You'll see. F letters: make your sound. Cool! Yes, the sound of the letter F is: As in the word "Fly". Let's try it! Hey, I'm flying! This is fun! Yes, that word works too! The F says: The F says: Every letter makes its sound. The F says: Ahh, professor! Learning letters is great!

The H says: Here is where we double check each letter to make sure it looks and sounds absolutely perfect! The E says: The F says: The G says: And the burster says bestrum pfffvavwa. Eh, and... this is why we double check each and every letter. I need a new letter H at checkpoint 3, please. Letter H at checkpoint 3. That's the letter H we know and love! There's something missing here. Good thing I have my pen! There should be, above this lowercase I, a dot. It appears my pen is empty... Hey, professor. Great shot! Shall we enter? I, icky. If you are the letter I then the sound you make is: This is the way we train the I letters to make their sound! Correct! The I says: The I says: Every letter makes a sound, the I says: Professor, I bet the little J is next door buddies with the little I Why do you say that? Because they both have a dot! Haha, excellent observation! The letter J makes the sound of: Jump! The J says: The J says: Every letter makes its sound, the J says: Wooow! Hmmm, I'm going to have to get that fixed! Ahh, the K letters are hard at work! Haaa, grasshopper. It is a kick to learn the sound of the most humble letter K. The K says: The K says: Every letter makes a sound. The K says: Like: "Kick!" It is the young, but wise frog who becomes one with the alphabet. Hey, that's the letter L! RRRRight! I know because my brother Leap and my sister Lily have one of those at the beginning of their names! The L letters learn their sound while L L licking L L lollipops. I wish I were a letter L. The L says: The L says: Every letter makes a sound. The L says: The L says: "Lick!". Ok letters. We'll do two spins to the right. Then letter I: you do an inverted pirouette, and letter J: a jump split! Letter K: a kickturn, and letter K, a launch! Here we go! Pfff. Hahahaha! They're the world's best letters, not the world's best dancers. Let's hear it! The I says: The J says: The K says: And the L says: They sound great!

Near nine o'clock? Na uh. Next November? No No No. Not noon. Not near nine o'clock, nor next November. Not now, not ever. Never! Tad, perhaps we'll have to come back to this room... Hey professor, The N says: Why, that's correct! The N says: The N says: Every letter makes a sound. The N says: Where are we, Professor Quigley? Tad, this is the O room! And I would advise that you duck. Duck? Why?! The O says: As in: "Ox" and "Octopus". Odd. You mean: the O says: as in the word: "Odd"? yes, and it's odd that the O letters didn't follow their trainer. But... That O says: The O says: Every letter make a sound.

The T says: Tad, do you realize That your name is like an English afternoon? How so, old... chap? Elementary, my dear boy. Both begin with T. Hmm, needs salt. Ok? We're agreed that a big special effects smoke machine is probably not the best idea. We better do a role call to make sure all the letters are here! I'll start with Q R S and T! Letters, please make your appropriate sound! The Q says: The R says: The S says: And the T, says: I also want to hear from E F G H, And I! I?

He's had a busy day of learning his letters. You mean: Tad knows the alphabet? Well, he sure knows his Zs. He has learned them all, from A to Z. He wanted to be part of the presentation and, well, I think I was too hard on him. Hey, I have an idea! Tad! Wake up! We have a big problem! Yes, I'm your problem. Don't worry. I won't get in the way at your presentation. That's just it, Leap lost his voice, and we need your help! You know all of your letters, right? You bet, and here's how were gonna do it!
