Hey, Jack. How are you? - Nice seeing you. Nice to see you. Go on. Get in there. Kill him! Finish him off. Kill him! Behave yourself, Sonya. We've got a long night ahead of us. That kid has got everything. Guts. Punch. And looks. Are you kidding? I could lick the guy he's fighting if I had arthritis. Hey, Mr Richardson. Hello. Where you been? Haven't seen you around in a long time. Just clearing the fresh New Jersey air out of my nose. Are you going back in the fight game? - No. What do you think of this kid, Callan? - He's alright. I caught him a couple or three times. He's got the stuff. Who's the foxy grandpa? That's Pop Richardson. Go on! Go on, kill him. Get in there. Finish him off. Finish him off. - Easy. You're using up your strength. What's the matter? Can't you stand a little blood? Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. That's it. That kid has got style. And it isn't only in his shoulder pads. You think he's so cute, huh? I'll take you back to meet him. I got entry. No. He is just a kid. Do you want to meet him? Yes or no? Sure. Come on. 15, 20, 25. A good fight tonight. I'll give you another spot in two weeks. Hello, Mr Richardson. Hello. I've been looking for you. Say, this boy Callan. Anyone handling him? - No. He hasn't got a manager. Hi, Callan. Here's a dame wants to meet the new champ. Hi. What's the matter? His nose out of joint? Don't you get it? He's a dummy. He can't hear. He can't talk. Nothing. Nothing. Some joke. You ain't champ yet. He's got to know how to pull his punches. Come on. Let's leave here. You still got two minutes to go. You going to finish the round? You want to hustle yourself another sucker? Go and play with your scratch sheet. Big deal. Creep. I'd have likely wound up paying for the drinks and wrestling him off the sofa. You may be a dummy, but .. What's the matter? You want to fight me too? Huh? No. Well, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to take me out? Dancing? Huh? Hmm? Okay. Get your pants on. Hey, what's going on here? Who are you? I'm his brother. Well, don't look so sorry about it. The champ and I have a date. Maybe we'll go dancing. Maybe I'll show him a good time. But I'll see he don't break training. Hurry up. Well, here we are. My town house. Did you like dancing with me? You know, you did pretty good. I still can't figure out how you do it. 'Vibrations', huh? Say. That's not getting your money's worth. I bet you don't even know how to kiss a girl. You learn pretty fast. Mark it 'paid in full'. What? Oh. When will I see you again? The next time you fight. And win. And have money to spend. You found your way home, huh? You finally made the grade with a girl. Look at the lipstick. How do you do it, Romeo? Did you whisper sweet nothings in her ear? Or did you talk with your hands, eh? Why, you .. - Cut it out. He can't hold own a decent job. Because sooner or later he's got to slug somebody. Fight. That's all he can do. Fight. - Sure, sure. So finally he fights for money. And what does he do? He blows it on a dame. I bet he hasn't got a dime left. You do understand, Paul. This contract is for seven years. I get the usual manager's cut. One third. Of your purse. Get it? One third. One third for what? I'm signing up the next welterweight champion. Jack Richardson. You had a boy killed in the ring. Jackie Lahren. Middleweight champ, and a good boy. I've been out of circulation ever since. Feeding chickens in New Jersey. Did you say something about him being champ? Hmm. With the right help maybe. He's got timing, concentration. Naturally aggressive. But he needs training. Lots of it. He needs the right matches. He needs .. a manager. Does he know what he's signing? I've been trying to explain. The 'fine print' too? You are a friend of his, Miss ..? - Bartow. Sonya Bartow. I don't blame you for being cautious Miss Bartow. A boy like Paul could easily be sucked into the wrong deal. Hmm. But you ask anybody around here about me. I will. And I'll read the contract. For Paul. Fine. But remember. This contract is just a piece of paper. Any time a fighter and I can't agree .. We tear it up. That is the way I work. I will. Read this for you. Okay? And we'll get in touch with you. Fine. Goodbye, Miss Bartow. - Goodbye. How about it, Murph? Do you think Paul should sign? There is no-one finer than Jack Richardson. About Lahren? Could happen to anybody. It just about broke Richardson all up when Jackie died. Like it was his own boy. Everybody calls him Pop. Button up, champ. Take good care of yourself. That's the boy. You can do it. Go, you've got him. Paul, that was beautiful. Beautiful. Go on, Paul. Get him! Paul, you did real fine out there tonight. Oh, Paul. It was beautiful. Just beautiful. - Get him in the shower, will you. Well, who do we fight next? Huh? I don't know. But I know one thing. I am not going to fight him every week and I'm not going to over-match the boy. Okay. Okay, Pop. I know. Paul is like a son to you. Okay. But you didn't think he was ready for Mendoza either. Paul did alright tonight. But if you milk him any harder you'll start drawing blood. You just worry about his matches. I'll worry about the blood. Then wipe it off your face. It's showing. Thanks, Jack. Hang on to it. You may need it someday. For your nose. What a night. You should have heard the nice things people were saying about you. You know something? I am tired. I don't know why you want to see the place tonight. I just got the furniture in. Just. It's your dough. Okay. But just for a minute, huh? Let me get you a drink. Sit down. Try it on for size. More surprises? For me? A real diamond. Just like I always promised myself. On me it looks good. You are very sweet, Paul. Real sweet. I love you too, Paul. In my own funny way. Now, don't start that marriage stuff again. First, you must become .. champ. Then I will break down. Bedtime for fighters. Goodnight, Paul. [ Buzzer ] Paul. It's so good to see you. Hi, Jack. - Hi, Sonya. Six fights and not a mark on you. Gosh, you look wonderful. Well, don't I get invited in? Sure. Come on in. The party is for Paul. You all know Paul Callan. I'll be out in one second. Come on in here. Look at you. Honestly. I'd better be getting over to Jersey. I've not seen my missus in three months. After a drink and a good schmooze Paul and I will drive you over. You'll get there quicker. Hello, Pop. Welcome home. Hello Paul. Is this what you wanted to schmooze about? You can't pull any wool over Jack's eyes. Sure, Jack. I thought we ought to talk about it. Whitey has offered us 75 hundred against thirty percent of the gate. To fight his boy. Right? That is what I said. Whitey knows and you know that I've already turned down the deal. Sure, Jack. Only it's not just the money. It's Paul's big chance. If he beats Burns he gets a crack at Johnny Lugano. After that there's nothing left but Al Logan and the title. If. If. If he has any heart left after going ten rounds with that dirty fighter Burns. Dirty? The referee gets paid to worry about what goes on in the ring. Burns knows all the angles, Whitey. And you know it. You've taught him. Rabbit punches. Kidney punches. Fast work in the clinches. Elbows. Lacing. He'll have my boy bloody in the first round. The answer is .. no. Well now, I didn't want to start a family quarrel. If you want to get in touch with me you know where I am. Paul can wait another year for a crack at the title and so can you. He needs more experience before he's ready for a fight of this kind. Turn the record over, Jack. The trouble is you are spooky. You are seeing ghosts. Jackie Lahren's ghost. If a fighter is going to be a champ he has got to take chances. Maybe even a beating. Any manager knows that. Even I know it. If you cannot forget Jackie Lahren. Go back to New Jersey. Go back to your chickens. Paul isn't fighting Burns. Not this year. Paul sis fighting Joe Burns in exactly six weeks. Not while I am around. Then take a walk. Remember what you said? 'If a fighter and I can't agree we tear it up'. Etc, etc, etc. Paul and I don't disagree. You want me to put it to him, Jack? Right now? You or me? Don't walk out on him, Jack. Not now. He needs you. He doesn't need me, Sonya. Not as long as he has got you. I'll take that walk. Relax. I don't think he'll walk very far. If you ask me the dummy is going to be shopping for a new manager. 'Man wanted. No experience needed'. You win. Fine. Fine. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Fine. That will stop a kidney punch. Cliff. Lace him. Here is a guard against lacing. Keep your head tucked down. Stay in close and be on the watch. Like this. Let me show you. See? Alright, Paul. You try it. That's it, Paul. That's it, boy. Glad you're with us, Cliff. You sure know Burns's style. I should. I've worked out with him enough. He can't fight clean even when he's training. Alright. Finish the round. The boy is quick. He's certainly picking up all the tricks. I hope he remembers them in the clinches. Sorry you changed your mind? No. I could never have left Paul go. She knew it all along, Jack. The girl is no good. Clean through. Maybe she is right about one thing though. About the ghosts. You and Jackie. Maybe. That's what I keep asking myself. The way he is now is bad enough. But if anything ever happens, like to an eye .. Nothing is going to happen, Jack. Nothing. Look at his footwork. Don't worry about him. He'll give that Burns a bad time. Don't you worry. Everybody around here is a manager. Time. Get in the kitchen. What is the matter, Miss? Lost? Paul Callan, right? - That's him. I'm on my way up to your training camp. My name is Ann Hollis. Doesn't Mr Callan use the sign language? - What do you want? I'm sorry. I'm a writer for Panorama Magazine. We'd like to do a story about Mr Callan. Sure. He'll see you back at camp. Be about half an hour. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. See what I mean? Now, other fighters hear the crowd shout and yell for blood and call them names. Of course, when he's in the ring what he doesn't hear doesn't bother him. There is an angle. - Exactly. That is one time Paul being deaf doesn't hurt him one little bit. I knew some other fighters who were deaf. They concentrate on the fight. Not on the crowd. And that is how it was as far back as I can remember. His training routine. Got to get his rest. Go on, Ann. So naturally, with my dad being deaf my brother and I learned the sign language. That is why they gave me this Paul Callan assignment. You know, I've never known him take to anyone so quick before. I think he senses I am not self-conscious around him. Besides, I like him. - I'm fond of the boy too. You know, when he first came I thought he was stupid or something. But he is real smart. It's just, he only gets like .. The bits and pieces of what people say. You know. Yes. I know. Why, it's a perfect schooner. Right to the last detail. Look. The deadeyes actually work. And so does the anchor winch. I think that is wonderful. I am a sailor too. Nineteen feet. It's mine. Of course I sail it. Almost every Sunday in Long Island sound. Would you like to try it? Good. It's a date. This is Miss Hollis. Panorama magazine. Miss Sonya Bartow. - Ma told me. I've just been admiring Paul's ship models. They're very artistic I always say. Yes, they are. They're beautiful. I hope you got your story, Miss Hollis. Yes, thank you. Mr Richardson has been very helpful. I bet Jack can tell you a lot. Miss Bartow. Would you mind if I mentioned you in the story? I don't write for the sport section of course. It's a human-interest yarn. Sure. Go ahead. I've known Paul right from the beginning. See, we're going to be married. He wants to wait until he is champ. That's a cute angle, don't you think? You can say I am an actress. She used to be a hoofer in a girlie show. Now she owns a goldmine. She's retired ion her dividend. There is a good angle. - Jack is quite a talker. Has he told you about the skeleton in his closet? I really must be getting back now. Goodbye, Mr Callan. Thank you very much. Goodbye, mister .. Of course I'll remember our date. You do know the sign language. Why don't you use it? I. Never. Like. To sign. Because. People. Laugh at me. And call me. Dummy. Yes. I know. They hurt you every time. How about that? He knows the dummy language. Don't use that word. Why not? He just did. Sorry. It's just that deaf people aren't dumb. They're just intelligent as the rest of us. With training they can even learn to talk. So, when will we see the story, Ann? They will have to like it first, Mr Richardson. Goodbye, Miss Bartow. Goodbye. Goodbye, Paul. Want a cup of coffee before you go? No. Thank you anyway, Mr Richardson. Like it? Hungry yet? Good. I'll get some food. Watch the mainsail. Hello Maris. Where is mother? - She's right here, Miss Ann. Hi, mom. Mother, this is Paul Callan. I told you about him. This is my mother. He prefers not to sign. He lip-reads fairly well. Of course. - I'll be right down. This way, Paul. This was my husband's room. Ann's father. He was an architect. He built all those. Yes. He was deaf too. Would you like to wait here for Ann while I make some tea? For a moment it was like having dad back at his desk. Of course you could, Paul. You can do anything. Anything you want. Stay in that corner until I say to come out. Keep your eyes open tonight, Ralph. You know Burns's reputation. All I ask for is a clean fight. Did you hear that, Burns? Clean. Put your needle away, Ralph. You got my boy all wrong. What stops the dummy hitting after the bell? I come between them. In case of a knock-down Ralph, stand where Paul can see you counting. Alright. Alright. Shake hands and come out fighting. He won't try anything dirty in the first couple of rounds. He has got to remember. He's got to remember. That's it, Joe. Away we go. There he goes. There he goes with those thumbs. Watch that lacing, Ralph. I warned you about low punching. And I don't want no more. You understand? Why don't you lay off, Ralph? Lay off. - Well, keep your blows up. Keep away from him. Keep away. Stay away from him. He's got to stay away from him. He'll be alright, Pop. He'll be alright. That's it, Paul. Now you've got him. Go on. Get in there! Kill him. Kill him, Paul. Why don't you fight a clean fight? Kill him, Paul. Go on. I shouldn't have listened to her. Why did I listen to her? He won't make it. He won't make it. That's it, Joe. That is the way to go. I'm going to stop this. He can't take it anymore. Quit and lay down, you dummy. Paul, get up! Get up! Paul. Get up. Get up please. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. What is the matter, Joey? How can you ride a guy like that? That dummy ain't got sense enough to quit. You got to put him away, Joe. You're slowing down. I'm going to stop this Paul before he blinds you. Break. Come on. Come on, Paul. Come on! Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. What did I tell you? I told you he would do it. Get him in the dressing room and check that eye. Okay, Pop. Try it some more. Bub, bub, bub, bub. Bub, bub. Pretty good. Pretty good. Let's say bub, bub, bub. You should explain to Mr Callan that most of these children are totally deaf. And that they're learning to lip-read and talk. Now Ann, if you have time I'd like to show Paul around the rest of the school. I am sure we have time, Mrs Hackett. Alright. Shall we go? Would you like to come here and teach them to box? Would you? Sweet .. and .. low. Sweet .. and .. low. Wind of the western .. Sea. Sweet. It is beautiful. What have you got that I haven't got? Except a million bucks. I think a lot about a million bucks. Every morning when I get up I think about it. You know what my mother used to tell me? 'Don't sell yourself cheap, Sonya'. 'You'll never hit the jackpot'. Dear old mom. Here he is. Lover-boy in person. My bills. I need some money. 'The Madison School for the deaf'. 'Our motto: Eyes that hear'. It's wonderful what money can do. What will they think of next? Now our Paul is going to hear. Paul. I've been thinking. About you and me. I think we ought to get married now. Not wait until you are champ. That is what you want, isn't it Paul? That's what you always wanted. Married. You and me. Don't you understand, Paul? Paul. Paul. Don't you remember, Paul? That is what you always wanted. I can make you so happy. Now. Right now. Let's not wait. You dummy. Look who's kissing me off. A dummy. Now, I'm not good enough for you? That's a laugh. Now you want her. You know when you will get her? When you get a new pair of ears. That's when you'll get your precious Ann. Can you hear that, Paul? Ann. Ann! Ann. New ears. New ears. New ears for the dummy. Here. For Ann. With love. Don't come any closer. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! Go on. Get out! Nobody wants you. Even I don't want you! Can you hear that? Dummy, dummy, dummy! What is the matter with you? You drunk or something? What's the matter with you? Dummy Callan. Alright folks. Come on, break it up. Will you move along there. This ain't nothing new to you. Come on. Please move along. Well, I guess I can't lock up the next welterweight champ. Not after that licking you gave Lugano. You know, deaf guys like you got to be more careful. You almost got yourself killed out there. Now, get in this cab and go on home. You better write down your address. Let him know where you want to go. Uptown. E.E & T. Clinic. Dr Lester. Well, go on. It's in New York. You'll find it. Does he understand? I think so. In our opinion. An operation to remove the pressure on the left auditory nerve .. Might restore part or all of his hearing on the left side. I want you to emphasise this is only a guess. An informed guess. But a guess. He says he doesn't want any more .. Double talk. He just wants to know when you'll operate. Alright. I'll call Dr Buell at the Powell clinic in Baltimore. Here it is, Ann. 'Jack. Will be gone a few weeks. I'm alright. Don't worry. Paul'. I don't know what's been eating him. He hasn't taken anything. Maybe one bag. Alright, Ann. I'll check with you tomorrow. He is mixed up in it. I'm worried about him. And the Logan match? You should be talking to them. That will have to wait. - But .. You remember me. Sonya Bartow. Of course. Where is he? Paul. What do you want? I could not sleep. I miss Paul. That's a very poor try. You want to say something else. You never missed Paul. You never gave him anything. You never shared anything with him. You couldn't miss him. I found Paul with dirty fingernails fighting four rounds for 25 bucks. I taught him how to dress. To eat. To stand up on his hind legs. I worked him up until he was ready to be champ. I promised to marry him. Everything was going to be rosy until the little rich girl came along. What do you want with Paul? Haven't you got enough things? Do you have to have a dummy to drag around? For laughs? For kicks? This house was built by a dummy. The things in it were acquired by a dummy. The women in it were loved by a dummy. I love Paul. If I didn't know it before I know it now. I don't know where he is. But when he comes back I'm going to tell him I love him. When he comes back he will come back to me. Morning, son. How are you doing? Are you hearing better, Paul? Do you hear me? Have you tried to talk? Paul. Do you want to try to talk? You do. Good. Do you have a girl? A girl. You know .. Do you have a girl? What is her name? Name. 'Ann'. That is an easy name to say and very pretty too. Try it. Like this. Ann .. A .. nn. Try it. An .. Come on. Try. Ann. Try again, Paul. Ann. An .. An .. Ann .. Ann. Ann. Good. Good. Fine. Paul, listen to me. You're going to learn to talk very soon. You are going to have lessons in speech. Lessons. Do you understand? Lessons so that you will be able to talk quickly. Good boy. Come on. PAH .. EE. PIE. Pie. Now, if you all say it well I am going to give you a piece .. Of .. pie. Pie. Pie. Say it again now. Pie. - Pie. Pie. - Good. Alright. Pie. Pie. Wonderful. Now we'll have our pie. Hes .. Hesit .. Hesit .. ates. Hesitates. Is. Lost. He who hesitates is lost. Good. Very good. Well, Mr Callan. Nice to see you again. Let me take your coat. Thank you, sir. Oh Paul. I am so glad to see you. Come in. I've been wanting to hear you talk, Ann. Ever since. I have been waiting. So long. A good show. This is the kind of party I wanted to come to. I get to kiss her next. Excuse me. Andy and Helen. This is .. Excuse me. Well, I'll kiss you. Tell me how it happened. Where have you been? How ..? I had an operation. In Baltimore. It worked. And you were afraid it wouldn't. Ann. There you are. You must come along and help us out. I'll be right there, Clare. Maybe I shouldn't have come. - No, Paul. It's alright. It's just mother's annual shindig for the Sailors Home. There's just all these people .. I could come back some other time. No, Paul. I want you to stay. Please. Paul, I just cannot believe it. And, darling. It's about the benefit concert. The others want to sell drinks and I say we always lose money on liquor. Come along, darling. You have simply got to help. Dr Gunley, this is Paul Callan. - How do you do. How do you do, doctor. Look after him for a moment will you, doctor. Talk about prizefighting. Ann, you're getting lost again. Paul Callan, the prizefighter. I've heard all about you. I thought you were deaf. Not anymore. Aren't you due to fight for the title? Yes, sir. - How exciting. How thrilling. A real prizefighter. And a psycho analyst. The two extremes. I've seen you in the ring, Mr Callan. You seem to enjoy it. Is that why you fight? I don't know. - What do you think, doctor? I think the average American female is .. Is probably more aggressive than any prizefighter. To The boy who kissed the prettiest girl on Long Island. Cheers. You're just the man I'm looking for. Do you know what my wife said to her analyst the other day? She said: how can you sit there and just listen? You know what he said? Who listens? Ann. Let's run off tonight and get married. But Andy, what about your wife and children? They'll understand. Not tonight, Andy. I'm sorry. Come on, Paul. This time it's about publicity for the concert. You know about that. You're quite right. Paul, don't look like that. It was empty. I was just coming over to talk to you. Ann told me. It is so wonderful about your hearing. Mrs Hollis, I was just telling the maestro that .. Mr Howard, this is Mr Callan. Dr Lanslow - Mr Callan. - How do you do. I was just telling the maestro here that the benefit concert is a great idea .. But the program? Rachmaninov. Khachaturian. I can't even pronounce the names. So be smart. Sweeten the program with a little Victor Herbert, Strauss. First, get the pubic in. Then elevate their taste. It isn't that at all. I'm entirely in favor of culture. What's become of art today? And literature? And all that's left is sick and morbid. Surrealism. Existentialism. The cult of death. You know, Jeb. You are a snob. You're looking for art with a capital 'A'. What about all the other vast media of communication? Movies, magazines, radio, television. All we really need is more initiative. Excuse me for a minute, Clare. Art. Ann, darling. Will you settle something for us please? I suppose Ann there has noticed. Because she works for a slick magazine. And writes an article on a deaf and dumb prizefighter. I am sorry. No. It was my fault. Paul, it doesn't matter. - A good show. Here is one you missed. Paul. Paul. Paul. Paul, don't run away. It was so cruel. You should have seen the look on his face. It was terrifying for him. Frightening. But he had to learn about the world of words and ideas. Your world, Ann. Right now he's probably wishing he had never been made to hear. Maybe he is even wishing he were dead. But if he is brave. And if he's lucky. He'll come out of it. And maybe he'll come back. It won't do any good to go after him, Ann. Because right now .. You are what he is running away from. Who's there? Who is there? Paul. Paul. Where have you been? You don't have to shout. Don't be afraid. Paul. You are talking. You're talking. I was just so surprised. It's just so wonderful. Paul, what happened? I'll tell you all about it. It's just so wonderful. You've come back. Home. Back to Sonya. Paul. Paul. Paul. Paul. What's the matter, son? - The noise. The noise. It gets worse. All the time. And so does your punching. You've lost your timing. You're not concentrating, Paul. I can't. I can't. Why don't you call it off, Paul? You are not a fighter anymore. If you get in that ring with 20,000 people screaming at you. Logan will kill you. I'm fighting Logan. If you want. I'll get another manager. But why, Paul? It's not just the money. I want to fight. I want to be champ. I owe it to 'dummy' Callan. What does that mean? I don't know. I don't know. It just came out. I don't know. Jack. I want you to stay. I'll stay. The kid has got nothing. [ Car horn ] Quiet! Keep your left up, Paul. Move in, move in. Sure. I'll handle the deal for you, Sonya. The odds have gone up on Logan since you spoke to the press. The wise boys say .. Never mind. Before the odds get any worse put everything I got on Logan. To win. Right. See you after the fight. Telephone for you, Paul. - Who is it? It's Ann again. Tell her to stop calling. - Why won't you talk to her, Paul? How is he coming? I'd rather fight Logan tomorrow night myself. Somebody ought to talk him out of it. Don't look at me. I talk to him nowadays and he is suddenly deaf again. Sometimes I think he heard me better before. You are staying until tomorrow? This place gives me the creeps. I'll see you in town after he weighs in. [ Radio: ] "Topical sports news on the welterweight title bout scheduled for tonight." "Less than an hour ago Champion Al Logan and contender Paul Callan weighed in." A telegram for Paul Callan. - I'll take it. It's alright. "Spectators wanted to get a glimpse of the contender." "Callan was kept strangely under wraps since he began training for this bout." Thank you, Miss. "The rumors which have been flying around can now be confirmed." "It's a sensational fact that Callan, known until now as 'Dummy Callan' .." "Was operated on and has regained his hearing." Hello darling. - Hi. Finished weighing in? - Uhuh. Did the doctor find you in good shape? Perfect. Where is Jack? He's downstairs with the reporters. They told me at the desk you had a telegram for me. It was nothing. Where is it? It was nothing. It was just a crank message. What's in your bag? - Nothing. What's the matter with you? What are you hiding? - Nothing. Come on. Give me. I didn't want to worry you right before the fight. But you're not worried if I go deaf. - Don't be a fool. If Richardson finds that he'll have the fight stopped. Just so long as I fight and lose. So you can collect your bet. Well, what did you want me to do? Look. I want that money. It's mine. I earned it. All that time I spent with you. With a dummy. Get out. Okay. I was going to kiss you off anyway. Right after the fight. If you're smart, let Logan finish you off quick so you don't suffer too much. Cover up your good ear, Paul. I'm going to slam the door. Hard. Ladies and gentlemen. Fifteen rounds of boxing. For the Welterweight Championship of the world. In this corner, weighing one hundred and forty-six and a half pounds .. Wearing white trunks. The challenger. Paul Callan. And in this corner. At one forty-seven pounds wearing black trunks .. The Welterweight Champion of the world. Al Logan. The referee. The referee: Frankie Batt. You boys know the rules laid down by the Athletic Commission. I want a good, clean fight. In case of a knockdown the other fighter goes to the farthest neutral corner. And stay there until I tell him to come out fighting. Keep all your punches in fair territory. A low blow may cost you a round. Shake hands now and come out fighting at the bell and good luck to both of you. Come on, boy. Come on, dummy. You can do it. I tell you, he's not the same fighter since he got his hearing back. Try to forget the noise, Paul. You are the better fighter. You've got to forget the noise and go out and take him. The guy must be holding off. I can't figure it out. Paul is taking so much punishment. Why doesn't he keep away from him? I shouldn't have brought you, Ann. I shouldn't have brought you. Break it up. Step back. Put him out of his misery, Logan. You're yellow. Paul. Will you listen to me, boy? Don't think of the crowd. Don't listen to them. You can take this guy. Just concentrate on Logan. He's got nothing. I'll finish him in the next two rounds. - Don't get too cocky now. Logan. Put him away. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Seven. Eight. Paul is giving it to him, Ann. Look. Paul is giving it to him. Go on. Give it to him, Paul. Give it to him. Go on, go on. Ah, that's more like it, Paul. You were great, boy. Three. Four. Five. Six. Give it to him, Paul. No. No. Okay, fellahs. Did you see it? Did you ever see the like? Right off the floor he comes. One-two, Pop. You know. Logan figured he had you all set up to put you away. Then you started throwing everything you had at him. What snaps you out of it? I said: what snaps you out of it all of a sudden? Are you still groggy, Paul? You had better stand where I can see you talking, Jack. If you want answers. It's my own fault, Jack. The doctor warned me I'd be taking a chance. Then .. Why? I was scared. I felt like I .. Didn't know anything. I guess sometimes people get so scared ..
