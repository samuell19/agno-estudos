Come here. Come on. First concrete, not timber. We said okay. Then steel. Iron, not steel. And what about that marble you promised me? I bought the marble... Ask misho... For the "bloody" staircase. We must finish now, open the hotel. We will, two weeks from today. One week, please. If we don't open, we have to pay interest, and my investors won't like that. I like having my head on my shoulders. Now, what's that mean? Off! Alex, we're building... Excuse me, sir. Not just a hotel, but the best hotel in the area... Solid, warm, a Jewel on the mountain. That was the plan, right? One week, please. Not without the bloody marble. For the bloody staircase. How does it look? It was fine last week. Whoa. What are we waiting for? Okay, gentlemen, go play, just not above the bowl. The snow's too soft. Yeah, no problem. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? What? Not in front of the clients, brother. That's $300 playing up there. Now, put it away. You know, you worry too much. Three hundred? You know, I've seen this great new pair of ski... Already gone. Present financial situation of cusslers extreme as of 0900 this morning... Assets, zero. Cash flow, zero. Cash owing... Sorry, man, I can't... I can't quite hear you with this on. Now, if a certain trading partner from cussler extreme hadn't taken a certain Danish client cavorting all over the mountains for free, present cash-flow situation would be about what, $500? Look, she just broke up with her boyfriend. She needed... she needed... Needed what? Comforting. Physical comfort... Lots of fresh air and bodily contact. The hell she did. Whoa! Ha-ha! Man, he's cutting too high. Yo, hans! Yo! Come on, sit down! Slow down! No. Whoa. I'm okay. I'm okay. Are you all right, hans? You see that? I cheat death. Jock, jock, jock, jock, jock, jock! If the bike's kaput, you owe US, okay? Paragraph three of your contract. Who cares? I told you I'm not too scared of a little danger. You listen. We said not too high on the slopes! If that bike is stuffed, I swear to god I'm gonna... thom? Thom. What is this, hans? We should go! Head toward the tree line. Go! Look at that. What's happening? Mama! Mama! Whoa! Whoa! Ho! Keep moving! Keep going! Mama! Hang on! Help me! Faster! Do something, quick! Aah! Faster! What the hell just happened? Let's go, guys! Hustle up! Katya! Come on, let's go. Coming! You're joking. Whereabouts? When did it happen? I'll get word to Stephan. Hey, what's wrong? Cheap television. Hey, Mike. Stephan, you heard. I'm on my way now. Sounds like a real mess down there. I'll ski down. It's faster. Hey, I'll come and help, too. Anna, mother will never forgive me if you start classes in stuttgart with your leg in a cast. I can take care of myself. No, Anna, not this time. Deal? Bye. He's right, you know. You'll be able to look after more people after stuttgart when you're a doctor. Thanks to you. You're the one who passed all the exams. You paid my tuition. It's my pleasure. Found one! I'm hearing something. Bring the dogs! There you go. Hey, we got one. Over here, rescuer we got one! Stretcher! Come on, buddy. We got you! Careful. Got one over here! So far there have been no fatalities reported in the avalanche, which hit the town of dubrov this morning. Local authorities say the avalanche was caused by snowmobiles from the cussler extreme touring company. The snowmobiles were running on high, soft snow, the apparent instability of which seemed to trigger the avalanche. Experts have arrived in town in order to monitor the possibility of further avalanches. Despite the avalanche, the decision has been made to leave the ski resort nearby, open for the time being. How many injuries? Christ. Was anyone killed? Thank god for that, I guess. What triggered it? Snowmobiles? How did snowmobiles cause something that big? Jock cussler... why am I not surprised? Let me know if there's anything I can do. Jock, your irresponsible ass. I will not pay. You're crazy. You said, "no problem." I should sue. I want my money back. And we also said, "not high on the slopes because it's dangerous." You're the one who crashed one of our bikes today. A word, thom. Not now, okay? Later. One hour, at the bar. Come on. We go to the hotel and get into some dry clothes. Okay? Come, come. You do that. How about this? We saved your life today. Thought you said it was safe, man. Rode that area last week. It was all stable. That avalanche should not have happened, not there. What are you saying, thom, that this was my fault? I didn't say that, okay? Jock! I heard what happened. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. You going somewhere? I'm going to get something to eat. With your boards, your cross-terrains, and your downhills. Where you going, the andes? How much is Callie paying you? What am I going to do? This place is a graveyard. You know what, Gregor? You could have at least had the decency to tell US to our faces. You should pack it in. Take it from me, it's no place to be poor. Told you he was going to quit. You ever get sick of being so damn right, thom? It's probably a good thing anyway. We couldn't afford to pay him, man. Why did you have to make everything sound like my fault? I didn't say anything, brother. Well, why don't you? Why don't you just say it? Why don't you tell everyone that jock had a great deal going with Callie and he messed it up because he screwed around, as usual. Now, you're going to be the one who ends up getting shafted, again. You know what, brother? You're absolutely right. This is all your fault. Yeah? Yeah! Really? Really! Yeah? Yeah! Good, I'm glad we got that settled. I don't know about you, but I need a drink. Yeah, me, too. After you. It will be in orbital position by... 0700 tomorrow, but they do not exactly give away satellite time, Katya. I am begging you. It's important. Ha-ha. I love it when you're begging me. Boris, this is life and death. Ladna, ladna, okay. Still doing battle against the demons of environmental pollution? Something like that. Will you help? Of course. How can I say no? Thank you. I owe you. Why can't you talk to the investors, tell them not to worry? Never even met them. You know what they're like, barely talk to each other. Rogov's the only one they trust. Yeah, I wish I could say the same. Callie, I know you don't like him, but he's done all right by US so far. Good to see you. Welcome back. Trouble is, if I don't open on time, god knows what they'll do. What kind of investors are these people? They're like most investors... nervous. Am I going to see you later? I've got to get together with the staff in town first. I hired a new ski instructor. You probably know him, actually... Gregor ozerof. Didn't he work for the cusslers? Nothing to do with it. We'll be swamped with tourists soon. We needed a new guide. He was available. Callie, success can be a sweet revenge, but it makes a lousy weapon. It was strictly a business decision, nothing to do with jock. I'll see you later. Are you listening to me, Mr. Mayor? This area has been overly developed... More people, more cars, even smog. It's created an inversion, a warm spot over the glacier, and now every time a front hits the mountain, it brings more and more snow. Sure is cold enough to snow, so where's the problem? But not to freeze. It's a breeding ground for avalanches. He knows nothing about avalanches. Now, you just get on with your beer, young Ivan the terrible. Your stories, unlike hers, are boring. In '64 we had to run. My legs were stronger, of course. First it was the shadow, like the sun had gone out. We ran, but some were not so lucky. It sounded like thunder, like... And the trees breaking like matchsticks. Yes, we know all that. In 1964 this happened? Where? In his dreams. See, that is the trouble with workplace romances. They always end up badly. Yeah, especially when she's your boss who can fire your ass. I didn't plan for to happen. You've got too many plans. My problem is I listen to them. Hey, thom, why don't you get your life savings and dump them into some old snowmobiles that are more like lawnmowers, and we'll take skiers up into the mountains. We'll make a fortune! I ought to have my head examined. It sounded like a great idea at the time. You have to start listening, please. Listen to Ivan? We are talking about a super avalanche. Hello, miss elkin. Everything all right? Hi. Thanks, Mr. Mayor. Usual table? Yes, usual table. Anything for you, miss elkin. A super avalanche. Look, Katya, it's your job to predict avalanches. It's not the end of the world. That's what your paid for. That glacier is a time bomb. So what do you want me to do? Talk to George elkin. You're the mayor, for Christ's sake. It is too dangerous to have more tourists in this town when avalanches are imminent. What else am I meant to do, marry her? That's what you said you were going to do. You told her that you loved her, okay? Yeah, I did. Hell, thom, maybe I still do. You know, things change and people move on. Listen, brother. Next time you're going to dump a little girl, make sure her daddy isn't around to Bury our business. Come on. She'll get over it, eventually. Well, it hardly matters now. After that avalanche, we'll be about as popular around here as the plague. You want to know what causes avalanches? There. That's what starts an avalanche. It was only a little avalanche. Mr. Mayor. Set 'em up, same as usual. I should've thrown you both out. You two have caused such a ton of trouble! Come on, have a heart. You're looking at two guys who cheated the grim reaper today. Well, guys, I think I'm going to call it a night. Good night, miss elkin. I'll see you bright and early for work tomorrow. Thought you had a party, sweetheart. Not much in the mood. Looking good. Your mother would have been proud, the work you put into this. What's the matter, sweetheart? Sorry, dad, I'm not really with it this evening. I sense a jock cussler moment happening? Come on. Shh. He breaks hearts, causes avalanches. What a guy. I tell you, I'm ready for that drink. What avalanche? Dubrov. That close? Our lady scientist is punching the mayor's eardrums as we speak. She thinks opening the hotel is dangerous, a risk. Rubbish. Do you know what will happen if we're up in the glacier and the window slams shut? All I need is a few minutes. Hell of a favor you're asking. The favor is that I can't actually pay you. That's not a favor. That's charity. Is that a no, then? Is what a know? She wants US to take her up on the glacier, in the the eye of a snowstorm. Cool, sounds like fun. I'm in. All right, you two wait here. Yeah? While I talk to the snow. She talks to the snow? Yeah, well, you were the one who insisted on helping her, Galahad. Do you need a hand or something? Shh, quiet. Okay, now she's eating the snow. It's okay, Katya. We got you. Come on, pull, pull, pull. There you are. You okay? Jesus Christ. What's happening to her? She's in shock. Go get the bike. We need it, quick. My god. Let's get out of here, brother. Thom... come on, Katya. Hold on, Katya. Go! I'll, um... I'll see you guys later. Hey. You scared US out there. Hell, everything scared US. Want to talk about it? They won't listen, so why should you? Try me. What's this? It's a satellite radar image of the glacier. The energy released by a collapsing fault is roughly the same as a ton of tnt. So what happens now? Total collapse, a super avalanche. Why did she freak out so much? No idea. It was weird, like... Extreme tours, cussler snow mobiles, rentals, and repairs, ski and snow board adventures. This is thom. How may I help? Mr. Elkin. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, he's with me now. Yeah, okay. Sure. Sure. Of course. Okay, bye. That was elkin. Yeah. Wants to have a little chat, you, me, and Katya. With this you've been trying to get the mayor to shut my hotel down before I've even put a key in the door? At least he spoke to you. He hasn't. In this town, we know everything about everybody. So why did you invite US here, Mr. Elkin? It's not like we're the enemy. Callie, I want you to listen to this. To what? Thom. Look, the dubrov avalanche should not have happened. That should not be sounding like it is, so I think Katya's on to something here. Speculative and hypothetical. Without hotels, this resort is dead. Which is what nearly happened to US. So, if you don't mind, I've got a snowmobile to fuel up, and you've got a hotel to open. Jock. Jock's right. I do have a hotel to open, and I can't justify remaining closed over this! My hotel is engineered... Engineered to withstand the force better than any in the area. Your hotel may be strong, Mr. Elkin, but what about the people on the slopes and in the streets? Believe me. Hell is not hot. It's cold, heavy, inescapable, and you're bringing it to everyone in this town. Jock. That was quite an outburst. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Not at all. Was it really that close? Do you want to talk about it? No. You don't believe her. It doesn't matter what I believe. It matters what your father does. Listen, do you think that we could get together later? I want to talk to you about something. Yeah, sure. Meet me in the cloud house, the ice lounge, in one hour? Okay. She's still got it. Some people never change. Alex, it's George. We need to talk. Hey, you need a hand? No. Okay, then how about telling me what it is between you and that damn chunk of ice up there? Go on. You need an ally, I'm it. What are you doing? There, that's what it is about me and that chunk of ice. You, um... Survived an avalanche. Yeah, that was cold. Look, I am so sorry. I... i... You know, you, elkin, these people will never understand. Try me. Talk to me. I want to know! Come on, damn it! Hey, champagne. You know, this never ceases to amaze me. Cheers. What are we toasting? New beginnings. We will not shut because of some silly girl's prediction. And what if she's right? I don't want to be responsible for people dying, not again. Give me an orange juice, frozen, please. So this is about Sarah, your wife? It's about not tempting nature, rogov. They will kill US. What are you talking about? Where do you think the money is from? This is not the west, you don't just walk into a bank. What have you got US involved in? Where's this money coming from? Open the hotel, please... Avalanche or not. I take delivery in two months. We'll be the only private helicopter tour company in the province. I want you to run it. What? Thom's a pilot, and you're the best guide I know. You actually want to hire US back? I'm willing to forget the past and do what's best for the business. And that's it? It's just all strictly business? That's right. This exactly the kind of thing I expect from you, Callie. What do you mean? You being the same old spoiled brat who thinks her money can buy her anything or, in this case, anyone. I'm just offering you a chance to get back on your feet. No, this is about you trying to gain control over me. What makes you such a hot commodity? A brand new helicopter is a pretty healthy bribe. A bribe? Look, I'll tell you what a bribe is. This... this is a bribe. This is what I will pay you to stay out of my life forever. There's something about that girl, the way she defended herself. She knows, Callie, and we're sitting right dead center. Everyone in this resort is here because of something we built and own. We're responsible for them. And I take it rogov isn't too concerned about that. No. Have Gregor check the slopes in the morning. I'll talk with the mayor. I'm not going to open the hotel until we know more. I'm not going to lose anyone else to this mountain. No, that would be unfortunate. Do you blame me for the death of your mother? You did what you did. Nothing's going to change that. But I should've been there to lead the search. I just spoke to Gunther. Someone put "avalanche" signs on the slopes. It was that girl, Katya. Talk to the mayor and have her fired. She has more courage and integrity than I thought. And you respect this? She's doing what she's compelled to do... What she should do. And I'm going to give her my support. Rogov, I'm not opening that hotel until I know more about that Ridge. It's too dangerous. Are you insane? You will start a panic. What was insane was thinking you could be trusted. You're not being reasonable. I told you the investors... The hell with your investors. I run my business as I see fit. Your business? Without me, you're just a foolish old man building a monument to his dead wife. That was very rude. I speak the truth. There is another truth you need to understand. If you do not open the hotel, my investors will physically hold in escrow what family you have left. Rogov, the well being of our relationship... I need to clarify something. Because it sounded to me like you are threatening my daughter. It's not a threat. In this country, it is business. You lay one finger on my daughter, and I'll rip your damn head off and ram it up your ass. And you can tell that to your investors. Hey, been looking for you. Katya's closed down the slopes, which is pretty damn defiant. I figured we could give her a hand. I don't think so. Okay, you going somewhere? Yeah, I'm leaving. Callie. Give the man a cigar. Look. What's this? She wants to buy one and give US jobs running helicopter tours. Man, she really is an evil bitch. Don't you start on me, thom. You turned her down. Of course I did. What do you expect me to do, just roll over and give into her blackmail? You don't suppose this could've just come from her heart? You know what? Who cares? Because, apparently, there's a great, big lump of ice up there that's just going to come down and take everybody out. Everybody. You know, bang. What's the matter, brother? You can't stand the idea that Callie just might care a little bit more about you than you do about yourself. Is that it? Well, thank you very much, Dr. Freud. You know what my problem is... There's only one? I've seen what happened to you and Lisa. No, I'm serious. What the divorce did to you... I couldn't handle that. It would tear me up. I'm not as you, thom. You know what? I knew you'd find someway to make this all my fault, brother. To hell with you. No, no, you're not going anywhere, not this time. What are you going to do, thom, stop me? If I have to. Really? Okay, okay! You wanna go? Go! I don't know why this time should be any different. Come in peace. At least you believe me. Yeah. I... I flew Kosovo... Helicopters. It's... It's kind of weird, but after a while you... You can sense danger. Yesterday on the slopes, I felt it. It's real. And you know it could happen anytime. We don't have much time, do we? Check the top runs, and if the snow pack looks risky, shut them down. I have two men who have booked a back country tour. They paid in advance. Then stay below the first Ridge. My grandmother can ski there. The first Ridge. No higher. And where are your beacons? At least get them for your clients. You might think you're invincible, but if that ice slams down, it will swallow you, and the beacons will be the only way to find your worthless heartbeat in the snow. Good morning. Come on. Get dressed. I know you planted those signs, and I want to give you all the support I can. Five years ago I let my family down at the worst possible time. You're right. Hell is cold, so just tell me what it is you need to properly check out that Ridge, and I'll do it now. Okay, we'll go. Quick. Quick. Come, Erik. It's time to fly. This is going to be great. What're you doing here? I asked you not to come. I told you, because you were childish. You are... What? Look. Gregor. Get Gregor on the radio. He's on the upper Ridge. Lodge to Gregor. Come in. Gregor, answer. Come in. You'll love this run. 50-degree vertical. This is more like it. No, baby slopes for US. Erik? Lodge to Gregor. Come in. Not now, rogov. I'm busy. No, but soon you will all the time in the world for me. What's taking so long? The tracks are loud. He can not hear. Let me try. Come in, Gregor. I know you're on the upper Ridge. Gregor, here. I read you. What the hell are you doing? That area's off limits. I'm sorry Mr. Elkin. It sounds like... It's safe, miss elkin. Don't worry. I'm an expert. I don't care. Get your ass off that glacier now. Do you copy? Okay, okay, we'll go. I copy. He won't listen to you. Bitch. He's not going to listen to her. How do you know? Because when he worked for US, he never did. Hey... Can we go to the next Ridge? That area's closed. Too dangerous. Perhaps another hundred American will change your mind. I need to use these. Hey, man, what are you doing? He's going to bring the whole thing down. They're going higher on the Ridge. Did you hear something? Gregor to lodge. Come in. Hello. Please. Somebody. Miss elkin, we need help. We need it real fast. Hello, this is ski rescue. Come in. Callie, it's Katya. Come in. It's Gregor. He's gone, and we couldn't help him. Listen, that was only the top snow shaking loose, it means the glacier is starting to break up. You have to evacuate. You have to get out of there now. Please. Well, we're not doing any good here. Come on. Well, you heard her. Come on, evacuate. Let's go. Keep them calm. Get as many people onto the gondola as we can, okay? Anna, come on! Jock, are you up there? It's thom. Over. Jock, come in. Come in, damn it. Keep moving! Keep moving! Please evacuate the slopes immediately. This is an avalanche warning. Please evacuate the slopes immediately. Everybody, please listen to me! Come away from the windows. We need to evacuate the building as soon as possible. Miss elkin, I must get on the gondola. You wait your fucking turn. Go! There's the gondola, go to it, run! Move! Move! I told you to move! Stop it! Wait! You go, too. Get to the gondola! I will go when you go. Go! Come on. Get on the gondolas! Keep going! Move. Move. Move! It's full. One, two, three... Go! Callie. That's it. Everybody's gone but US. Maybe we should ski down. No, there's no time. The ice cave. We need to get down into the ice cave. Go. Go. What are you doing? My brother's still up there. The snow is still unstable. We must wait for it to settle. We don't have the time. Thom, he's right. The lodge is gone. No one could have survived. So, what? We just stay here and do nothing? You're on your own. No, he isn't. Fine, we'll all go, too, but I lead the rescue. Hey, here! Here! Up here! Help! I've got five pings. We search here. Two meters. Four meters. We're close. Look, this is gonna take hours, man. What did you expect? Look, we don't have the time for this, okay? Just look around you. This is a big white lake, and we're looking for tiny signs of life. The beacons were in the pro shop. They could be anywhere by now. Come on. The beacons are the only way to find them. Jock doesn't even have a beacon. He's in the ice cave, and Callie's with him. How do you know that? Because jock's voice is the last thing I heard on the radio. And if he's down there, he's alive. How do you know they're down there? He's my brother. He's a cocky, immature kid, but if there's one thing that's pure about him, is that he loves your daughter, okay? If she's with him, she's alive. Come on, this is... this is your lodge. You must have walked these grounds. Let's find the ice cave, okay? What's the view like from the lodge? The guests had to have a clear view of the town below. We're too low. We're too low. Too low. Somewhere here! It's not right. We're off. We're off. He can only guess. Just trust your gut. Here. We dig here. Over here guys! We dig here! My brother's here! Go, go, go! Take the ropes. Take it. Let's go. Come on! He's over here! My brother's over here! Callie? Callie, don't do this to me. Not now. Callie. Callie, wake up. Hey, you had me scared there. You okay? Anna? Anna! Easy, thom, easy. Anna... Okay, hold her head. Katya, it's me, Boris. I'm just hearing what happened on the news. It's looking like you were right all along. I am sending you the latest satellite images taken over your area. I'm thinking you better be looking at them. Come on. Please... My god. My god. This is ski rescue, come in, Gunther. Gunther... Gunther... Anyone out there, please come in. Thom... Here it comes. We've got to speed it up a bit. Come on, let's go. Here we go. New bucket. Yeah. Coming down. Son of a... We're going to be in here a while. We have to get Anna out of here. I know. And we will. Don't worry. Look, if I know my brother, he's up there now. He's digging US out, okay? How can you know that? He's been pulling me out of tight spots my whole life. No reason for him to stop now. Looks like we've got a lot of debris down here. Bring me down a bit. Put me down a bit. Stop there. This whole place is going to cave in. The snow's settling, but we still have time. My brother will come. How can you be so sure? We have to get out of here now. No, no, no, don't touch that. Don't. You'll Bury US all. Calm down. We have to conserve the oxygen. The rescue chopper. It's coming straight for US. It's coming in too low. The snow pack's too unstable. Thom's going to get buried down there. Ground to chopper. Back off. Ground to chopper. Back off. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on! Aah! I know you heard that. If we don't start digging out of here, we'll all die. I told you my brother's coming. Your brother thinks we're all dead already! No, don't do that! Please don't do that. You're going to bring the whole thing down. Here's to the lives lost, and here's to the lives spared. It's not over. What's not over? The last avalanche caused the glacier to fracture even more. It will go any second. But it's already happened. We saw today was a ripple in a pond. What's coming is a tidal wave. In '64 we had to run. I was a young man. My legs were stronger then. Shut up, Ivan. We have to evacuate the town. It's too late. It's going to cover the entire valley. We need to find shelter. Shelter, where? The clear sky. Elkin's hotel? He said it could withstand an avalanche. Soon I will find out. Get thom on the radio. Tell him what's coming. He's alive? Yes, he's alive, beaten up but still alive. Then tell him to get off that mountain. Look, everyone to the hotel, now! You all right? I can't... I can't do this anymore. Yes, you can. Pull me up. Pull me up! Thom, listen to me. I was trying to tell you and Katya about my family, about my wife. Pull me up. I lost her. I didn't fight for her, and I've regretted it every day for the last five years. If you don't do this right now, you'll hate yourself for the rest of your life. Help! Help! Bring me down a bit. Bring me down a bit. I'm going to need the saw! Get the saw! We'll get you out of here, and we'll get you all fixed up. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, Anna. Don't worry, we'll be out any second. It'll be any time now. Just hold on. It looks like we're past the worst of the debris. Beginning to hit ice, though. Thom! Did you hear that? I'm still here. I found it. I found it. I can't breathe anymore. You listen to me. We can get through this thing together. You know, that's all I wanted, US to be together. I know. I was just being scared. You know, the relationships around me, they never worked. They always ended up badly. My parents... Thom... That's why she crushed him. I guess I was kind of worried that you'd do the same. It's okay. It is. And that's what I came here to say to you today, Callie. Callie, I came to ask for another chance. Almost there. Almost there. Hey. Hey, Callie... Callie, stay with me. Come on. Come on, stay with me. Listen to me... I love you. Hey, hey. I found them. I found them. Over. He's found them! Thank god. I'm going to call down the chopper. Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, we're okay. We're fine. But we need to move fast. Come on! Lock up the windows. Come on! Help me! Door! So, brother, is it good to be back? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. It's not like that. I did what I should. I've lost nothing. Quick! Come on. Let's get him out of there! We got you. It's okay. We got you. There you go. Who's next? Here. Well done, girl. Well done. This way. Keep moving down the hill. Right this way.
