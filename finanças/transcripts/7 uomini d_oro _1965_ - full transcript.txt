You hear me, as long as you have before you leave ... The safe is already empty ... Just a minute professor ... Stop making a noise The police have arrived ... Open, please. See, Commissioner, nothing unusual. It's absolutely impossible. On top of that, the bank is full of photoelectric sensors. More, we have a basement flood system .

Look, you see, I'm here again. Say something. Excuse me, Miss, Can I do something for you? I came to take something out of the stock box. I'll ask someone to accompany you Have you been our customer long? Not long, yesterday I opened this box to keep my jewellery. I'm sorry I wasn't here yesterday. I'm sure I haven't seen you before. I've managed this bank for five years, and I think I know all the clients, accompany this lady to the safe I'm driving the lady. You are perhaps one of my last clients here, Today, the board of directors approved my resignation. I will go on a well-deserved holiday. I think you're happy.

When I left the Bank of Zurich five years ago .... ... the last client was a very attractive and beautiful woman ... ...like you Thank you for choosing us, and I wish you luck. Everything is fine, professor. Contact has been established. I've finished. Everything is alright. It's good, you can go. Those came from the gas. Stop them. Quick. That's why it's not gas ... Why do you think he did that ... A smart boy ... Don't say that. It smells like gas. Professor, that Portuguese idiot opened the gas before ... Don't worry, the Portuguese idiot just shut him down Prepare the luggage ... Please stop the traffic ... He hit us... Come with me, Who did this... The one who stopped the gas ... Do you recognise him? Of course. He is a wild man, evil eyes with a lot of malicious intent ... Come with us, This is the customs receipt, That's what you get. The original stays with me, Excuse me there's something else here ... ... 7 tons of bronze waste for the Ambrozzi foundry. ...is it correct? It's correct It's all for the customs. Please sign here ... He's a genius. Everything is perfect . Exactly as planned. Thank you Saint Pancratiu If we get out, I will build you a church 24 carat gold. ... there is transport here in Geneva Another signature here ... You can get your cargo in Rome, as you requested ... ... anyway, if you don't, it'll go to the foundry. ... it may be a delay, or a mistake These things can't happen ... ... as long as the goods leave Switzerland ... ... it will get to where you indicated ... ... otherwise, it will remain registered in Naples. But the foundry ... Stop waving me off ... We are at the last stage of our journey I ask you for maximum cooperation ... to be sure of success. First... ... prepare the cars in order to give them back ... in exactly the same condition as we left them The deadline is no later than tonight. Tomorrow you will cross the border In one car You will all have new passports ... to avoid the current passports that have entry visas ... Three... Georgia and I left the train at 9:45 Tomorrow, in Rome, the gold is ours We meet at three o'clock tomorrow at the Hilton Hotel. That is all, gentlemen. Thank you. Seven tons divided by eight, What do we get from this? Three and a half tons. How is that so? Seven divided into eight ... makes three and a half tons for you and three and a half tons for me. And the others? Nothing. But tomorrow they will be in Rome Why do you think I gave them fake passports? Tomorrow the police will detain him, and we will be free ... with gold, of course. And after? After what? They'll find us easily ... ... they are the best in Europe, you said. And I don't think they'll give up. Now you play your part. If they find us ... ... you will prove that the cargo arrived accidentally ... ... the turnãtorie ... ... and was smelted. Magnificent. And what will they do when they find out that the gold hasn't reached the foundry? They won't find out ... I took care of that. Get in... I thought you didn't show up, my dear. I always show up on time, you just know. Let's do our job. Where are the freight documents? I took them ... ... the gold will arrive in Rome tomorrow. And we'll be there to take it. What about him? Have you thought of anything? We could throw him off the train. It would make us hard ... They're going to look for him. ... everyone will get their share of the gold. What if they find him? He will tell them that the gold has reached the foundry And I'll to swear to it What if he doesn't do that? My lawyer in Geneva will send you seven letters, Six to the professor's accomplices, seventh, Geneva police. Only if we have problems. The first six letters contain evidence of his double play. And guess what in the seventh letter? That's all you know, my dear. Here, that will put him to sleep for a week. Don't worry, my love. I told the driver not to wake him up in Rome. Prepare your passports, Grand Saint Bernard Border Post . I told you we would .... We came to pick up the cargo Hugo, parcel 686 didn't go to Naples? It didn't. Sorry, but it left for Naples yesterday The document says that we will take him from Rome this morning. No madam, look here ... Delivery goes directly to the destination. Of course... And the destination is the Ambrozzi foundry I think it's a mistake I'm sorry... Take this, it's for you They were with turnãtoria Ambrozzi you have the number on the document ... ... tell them not to smelt the delivery until we get to Naples. They called mediately. I'm not here to listen to your lies ... ... you left Switzerland with fake passports We can explain, Inspector ... It was just a practical joke. Someone changed our name on the passports. He probably thought it was funny. And who's the comedian? If I knew, I would say right away. My first reaction was to tell the police. Mine too... We already know this. Hold them until they decide to speak Where are we now? We will arrive in Naples in ten minutes I was waiting for you to call me, to bring you coffee. Bring it now. If you are a stunt fan. Someone shot at us. And I know who. Who did it? You won't find him among us ... He's probably in a safe place, with the gold. Not possible. You said. For me, it's over. First let's find the gold ... ... then we'll find out what to do. In seven hours they will let us go ... They have no evidence to arrest us, and we know that. You're right. Let's wait. I can't believe he's the professor. It's too late sir, the metal was smelted. It's mixed with nickel and iron. 20 tons nickel, 200 tons iron, 7 tons bronze. Can't be separated? Can't be separated from the mixture? The bronze has gone. It is part of this alloy with iron and nickel. Used in the manufacture of safes. It can't be a mistake. We receive a bronze shipment from Switzerland every month And we make the best safes for Swiss banks. There has to be a delivery today. It was this morning with document 686. it was delivered to Naples. Like every month The document does not specify that it went directly to Naples. It was probably a mistake in Switzerland ... I wouldn't have noticed the substitution. I was just the means to get to gold. Now that the gold is gone ... I don't want to see you again, I've wasted five years for nothing. I want to forget everything as quickly as possible. This is your opinion after what happened in Zurich And what's your part in all this? Perhaps we'll find out next time. There it is... I was at the foundry, It was smelted with 200 tons of iron and 20 tons of nickel They say it's an excellent alloy. They use it in the manufacture of safes for Swiss banks. Why didn't you stop them from smelted it? Because it was too late. A mistake in Switzerland, the freight documents sent him directly to Naples And the professor? He's devastated, he doesn't want to come back. But there must be a logical explanation for such a mistake ... And we doubted him ... I think we'd better talk to the professor. What help would that be? We know that the professor comes up with solutions. He might think we're finished. We could plan a new hit. Yes, we could arrange it in a few days I just told you that he doesn't want to work with you anymore. Maybe we can convince him. Perhaps you can help us Perhaps he'll come and talk to us. It was bad luck It's the second time... I think Georgia will arrange a meeting with the professor. Don't rely on me, I'm tired. If you want my opinion, friends, let's go So here we are. Hope dies last. And he told you where I am. Single? No gold and no obligation. What did you expect? Of course ... and I'm glad. I thought you were going to shoot me It's not my style. I came to get you. After all I did to you? You did the right thing, I understand you. Now that the gold is gone ... Do you think I care about gold at all? No ... Let's go. How outrageous. Relax. And now for the explanations. 10/1, gold is after the gate Let's go and see. We'd better wait. I'll go to the bar ... and get some food. Let's go quickly. The gold is behind the truck. As you can see, the gold was not in danger. Perfect planning. Except for unforeseen events. And when you have the best plan The devil can go to hell And the devil is your plan? This is a masterplan... ... I know it can happen. Guess who's following us. Our six friends. We need to talk to them. We're all together. and you my dear August. I lost, so I'll pay. Before making any decision, I want you to know that my lawyer in Switzerland ... I love him... An incurable romantic. When you make a decision ... This is gold and ... ... a truck. Pay attention to the truck. Stop the truck. Don't move. Look at this. Don't touch ... National Bank of Switzerland ... 24 carats ... Call for reinforcements. professor, let's do something ... It shouldn't end this way ... ... you have to help us, professor... ...you have to do something. It's too late Adolf, too late It's mine, it's all mine ... What are you doing here? It's for the parish ... We have so many poor people ... One is enough ... Is this your gold? We just tried to stop the lorry... Remain here as a witnesses. Find the driver ... Come on professor, let's do it again ... There won't be another time ... Get in the car ... The bank in this movie was not the subject of theft ... and the theft was imaginary, like the seven golden men. Everything is fine, professor. We are above the catacombs of St.Vitus. The inclination is exactly that calculated ... The intersection is exactly where it should be at 35 degrees ... The operation will end in an hour... ... we'll see in the next film ...
