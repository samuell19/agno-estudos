Ma'am, sir will see you now. Thank you. Ms. Naina Mathur. Please sit. Double Bachelors in Education. And Masters in Science. Impressive. Thank you, sir. Some water? It'll stop your hiccups. It's not a hiccup, sir. I have Tourette syndrome. Huh? What syndrome? Umm... It's a neurological condition ma'am. Sometimes when the wires in the brain have a loose-connection... ...they give a shock. So... how does it stop? Sir, this isn't something that stops. It does get worse - when I am nervous... like right now. So you make noises even when you sleep? No sir, when I sleep, even my brain sleeps. But how long will we keep sleeping? WE? Yes sir. Me and... my Tourette's. Does it affect your eating or drinking? We manage well ma'am. I do the eating, he does the drinking. Well Ms. Naina, we'll call you. Ok sir. Thank you for your time. Thanks for coming. A friendly advice Ms. Mathur, if you don't mind. Teaching jobs might be difficult to get with... this. You could try a different profession. Hope you understand. Sir, can I ask you all something? Yup. Did any of you know anything about TOurette's before today? No, not at all... And now? Well... now we do. So, if I can teach something new to Principals and Trustees, I'm sure I'll be able to manage children sir. Thank you. Busy-birdy, she flies away. Busy-birdy's not gonna stay. Busy-birdy, she flies away. Busy-birdy's not gonna stay. Won't budge an inch, How she swerves and sways! It's slowly gonna come together. Why ruffle feathers? Fate's gonna give you a call. Why worry at all?! Naina, don't work in the dark! Why do you never listen? You'll ruin your eyes my child. Ma! This is Chicken Amritsari, this is stuffed potato. And Didi, check out the filling, this is keema marinated in vinegar. Leave your experiments in your restaurant's kitchen. This kitchen - is my kitchen! What a line... This kitchen - is my kitchen! Lick your fingers, before you scold me! It's slowly gonna come together. Why ruffle your feathers? Ms. Mathur, the kids won't stop laughing at these noises you make. When will they study? Ma'am, I'll make sure instead of laughing at me, I will teach them to laugh with me. Don't let go now, we're halfway there. The road calls... will you dare? I can offer you the job, but you will have to stop making these noises. Sir, actually even you have a disorder... IGNORANCE! Along with new teachers, this school also needs a new Principal! Good day, sir. Why worry at all?! Why worry at all?! The tiny ant may slip and fall, and yet it carries every grain up the wall. Quiet! Shut up everybody. Stand up Naina. Why do you keep making these noises in class? Waa-waa all the time! And you guys, why do you have to laugh at every little thing?! Sit down. The ant's persistence gives her strength... Quiet I say! See, let me be honest. With her condition, it's difficult for other kids in the class... ...and Naina as well. - But sir... I'm giving you this Leaving Certificate without mentioning the reason. Maybe she needs a different kind of school, Mrs. Mathur. Bye. Bye. Papa, this one. Naina? Papa,L" One chocolate cake please. Why don't you get it Sudha? Naina needs a special school. Naina needs a normal school. A normal life. She's a normal girl, Prabhakar. Normal! With those tics?! She's constantly ashamed of these noises. She's ashamed? Or are you?! Have you forgotten, why we separated? Look... Naina is still my daughter. Yes, she is, so where were you all these years? When she needed you. Didi. Dad is here. I'm not well. At least come and say hi. Can I say Hi and Bye together? Ya, okay. Come now! Just go, I'll come. Please leave me Vinay! Please! What's wrong? All okay? Just a normal cold. She's fine. Stress. What else! Take this. I have a friend in banking. It's a job offer... for you. Open it. Naina, part time animator. That's not a job! Part time because I need time... to look for teaching openings. You've been looking for teaching openings for 5 years now. With your condition - Vinay, you'll have more rotis no? Err, okay. Why don't you talk to her? There's enough dough in the fridge, Naina! Just read it once? Sorry, my hands are dirty. I'll read it later. How much is a teacher's salary anyway? Dad, did you have a favourite teacher in school or college? Of course! You remember his salary? Forget it Dad. You'll never get it. Ya, I'll never get... Hello. One second... Didi, St. NOtker's! Her hands are not dirty anymore? No sir, that's my dog. It's time for his lunch, no? Yes, of course, I'll be there. What time? Day after, 11? I'll be there sir... ...but you need a teacher in mid-term? No... no sir, I don't have a problem, I'll be there! Yes, yes, of course sir. What happened? I got the job! No, no. No way, Didi! Life is a circle, really! I got the job! Your qualifications are excellent Ms. Mathur. Thank you, sir. And I like your spirit. We are willing to give you a chance. Thank you, sir! Thank you. Also because we... badly need a teacher. Mr. Wadia! Please. You can begin. You have Tourette syndrome? Yes sir! I just want to know, you said you've applied to 18 schools with no success. Even St. Notker's has rejected you 5 times. I'm just curious, with your condition, why do you want to be a teacher? Because of that chair sir. You want to be the Principal? Oh! No sir. Like the 18 schools that have rejected me, I was thrown out of 12 schools as a student. This school was my lucky number 13. I sit here in front of you, wanting to be a teacher, because Mr. Khan, who sat in that chair 22 years ago, taught me the biggest lesson of my life. Who is here so vile, that is not a... Good countrymen, let me depart alone. And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Congratulations for this wonderful performance. Now tell me, during this performance... ...did any of you hear some peculiar noises? Whoever was making those noises, please come on stage. Come to the stage immediately. What's your name? Naina Mathur, sir. Can you stop these hiccups, please? I can't sir. Why not? I have Tourette syndrome, sir. I have never heard about it. Sir, it's a neurological problem, because of which I get... like an electric shock. What do other students say to you? They laugh at me, and tease me sir. And teachers? They throw me out of the class sir. Tell me, what can we do for you? How can we help you? Sir, just treat me like the rest of the students. Please. My child. This is a school. Everyone comes here to learn, but today you have taught us something. On behalf of St. Notker's I promise you, we will treat you just like the other students. Okay? Go back. A normal teacher only teaches you, a good teacher makes you understand, if he's great - then he'll show you how to apply it. But some teachers inspire us. For me Mr. Khan is that kind of a teacher. Mr. Khan was an inspiration for all of us. To me, he still is sir. Sir, I assure you sir, I won't let you down. I was born to be a teacher sir! Ms. Mathur... will you be able to manage with these sounds? I mean I've never seen a teacher with a speech defect. Tourette's affects my speech sir. Not my intellect. Come with me Ms. Mathur. Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am. Bad choice! Good morning, sir. National Science Fair? St. Notker's has won it for the last 2 years. All credit to Mr. Wadia - our science team in charge. We're expecting a hat-trick this year. 9A. The school's brightest students. All the toppers are from here. Sir... I was in 9 C. Sir, F division? There was no F division, before? Well, thanks to the Right to Education initiative - we do now. Just 14 kids. Just 14? But... why is this class empty? Because their class teacher is on leave. Permanent leave... I'll be honest with you, I urgently need a teacher, which is why I'm offering you this job mid-term, Ms. Mathur. I see a spark in you, and I'm willing to take the risk. I wouldn't offer this job to you under normal circumstances. But neither are the circumstances normal, and nor is this class - 9F. I'd say, think it through. Sir, I've thought it through. I really want the job and I'll not let you down. They're just kids... How bad can it be? Ma'am, you're going to teach 9F? Ya, why? Nothing. It's great. Ma'am... 9F is upstairs. This way. I know. It's so dirty, why don't they clean it?! Someone tell that Shyamlal to clean it everyday for us! The echo here is the bomb, man! Got a smoke? What should I call these guys? You rack your brains, they're your rats! I got a smoke... When did you start smoking? No ya, I am just holding them for Killam. Bro, the cops raided us yesterday... we had to scoot! They gonna get you one day man! So what should I call them? Wadia and Pareiral? No, no, my rats will die from the shock! Hey! Don't smoke near from my rats. You'll ruin their lungs like your own! Ravinder! Wanna bet? That stammering idiot won't survive a day. Who told you she stammers? The peon - Shyamlal. Bro, trust Shyamlal only to smuggle cigarettes! Not information. Give. If you don't know how to smoke, why do you do it!? Show me. There you go. Tamannah... what will you buy if you win the bet? There's a new nail polish shade... Katrina Kaif wears it. She wears what?! Girl, the whole world wants to see Katrina Kaif's fingers. Who will you show your fingers to? Those ladies-fingers! Okay, guys, guys, guys! Listen up. 10 cents on the buck - Ms. Stammer won't last a day. 60 cents - if she lasts a week. Who wants the action? I'll take those odds. - How much? - Here's 10 bucks. It's betting... not 'begging'! Here's 30, now shut your mouth. Here's my 20. You won't bet on Ms. Stammer? Who gonna bet? Ms. Stammer is who 9F gonna get. We gonna light a fire, her eyes will be wet. He's the punter, and we gonna hunt her... ...cause we're no fakes, like those 9A stunters. Notker's is a pond, we're its big bad sharks. Stammer's a goldfish, no bite, all barks. In these waters, we swim and surf. Pipeline's our home, Notker's our turf. Don't push me! Then stop being a tortoise! - Move it! - You move it! I'm the wolf, you're the pack... follow me! Class, I'm your new teacher, Naina Mathur. What was that? Education isn't limited to the classroom or school hours. So whenever you need me - this is my number. Sorry. Madam... "whenever"? Hey! Respect women's guys! Yes. "Women's... women's!" Let's do introductions along with the roll call? Aatish... Present. It's me, ma'am. Ashwin... Yea, yea, yea. Arundhati. Present ma'am. Killam. Cha woop woop... present ma'am. I got it right no? Looks like, you are more interested in my tics than roll call. So let's start with that? I have Tourette syndrome. It's a neurological disorder. When there are some loose connections in our brain... ...it gives small shocks... like that. You can ask me anything you want to know about my Tourette's. Ma'am, what's your ring tone? L'll tell you... 1, 2 cha cha cha... 3, 4, cha cha cha...! Dude, these days my rats also make the same noises. You think they also have Tourette's?! Ya! possibly. Ma'am, have you heard rats do the chee-choo rap? Ghee choon, chee ch00, the rats are going chee choo. Hey teacher, going cha-cha, this class just ain't for you. We scratchin our heads, me and my crew. Is this a school, or a bloody zoo. Ms. Stammer, you stammerin. Why you always yammerin. C'mon be on your way, you and your hiccups can't stay. Hey Killam, she's such a bore, can't do it, no more, no more! Ghee choon, chee ch00, the rats are going chee choo. Hey teacher, goin cha-cha, this class just ain't for you. Ghee choon, chee ch00, the rats are going chee choo. Hey teacher, goin cha-cha, this class just ain't for you. Ghee choon, chee ch00, the rats are going chee choo. Hey teacher, goin cha-cha, this class just ain't for you. Why did you stop? That was just like me. Exact. The only difference is, you can stop it any time you want- but not me. You know, there are bets being placed on how long I'll last, and why others didn't last. But you guys don't know that I haven't come here to quit. I've come here to teach. Ravinder, here's my 100 bucks. I'll bet on me staying. Take it. A real punter never goes back on his word or his odds. If your chee-choo rap is done, shall we start the class? Ma'am, this is just the first lecture. For staying, you will have to first get back on your feet. C'mon get up. That's right! She's not going to leave that easily. Stop staring bro, she's out of our league. She's the topper of 9A. - I'm also the topper of 9F bro. - Huh? - At staring bro! - Right! Hey, F for failure! Pass the ball. What's wrong man? Why you fighting? Look what he did to the ball? It's not as bad as... ...what's gonna happen to you now! Aatish. Hey... hey... Stop it at once! Stop it! Get up, 96¢ UP! Sir, look what they did to the ball. Don't worry sir, there's not a drop of blood on the football. Look! You. Principal's Office. Okay sir! Come on, come on! Come on. Ma'am, you're early! Ya... I needed to get some books from the library, so... So... you're going to hang in a little more. Shyamlal, I wanted to ask you something. What's the deal with 9F? Who are these kids? You see that playground, ma'am? There used to be a government municipal school there. There's a slum near that sewer, across the highway. Things were perfect. The garbage went into the sewer... ...and the kids from the slum went to the municipal school. Then one day they learned the school was on leased land... ...and the kids' future was now collateral. So, St. Notker's management rushed to the aid of the Municipality. The government has come up with something called Right to Education. So the Municipal school students became St. Notker's students, and that land is now St. Notkers' playground. 9F is the last batch of these slum kids. Their parents don't have a problem with a separate division for these 14 kids? Their parents have bigger problems to worry about ma'am... ...like putting food on the table and standing in line to fill water. Ma'am, in the beginning, these slum kids tried really hard... ...to keep up with the kids here. But the kids here never accepted them, and even the teachers didn't help much either. So now the slum kids are rebelling. You're their 8th class teacher in the last 7 months. Bloody dog! But what's the matter? ' Dye'? " Ya'? - What's the answer for this? - 3. I'm little Tamil boy straight from Chennai to Dharavi. I'm too local, don't mess with me and get killed. I'll pop like soda bottle instantly if you test me. And it's us when it's all hip hop wicked and wild in this city. Aah... wild in the city. Hear ye-hear ye, listen up! Say what, what, what?! You bring your A game, but we the real playas! Ma hommie's a little slow off the bloc. He no rabbit, he da tortoise... he's gonna beat the clock! Madam please, go easy, they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G! You feel me bro?! Vasco De Gama, got no home or place. He cries to his Mama, cause we on his case. Carrots and sticks, for the lady with tics. Here's a mango! Make her do the tango! No! I don't give 'Free massages'! Wrong number! Don't you give massages? But don't be glum, our time has come. In this ring, we're the only kings. Madam please, go easy, they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G! Madam please, go easy, they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G! A solution is a homogenous mixture of two or more substances. Lemonade, soda and water, are some examples of solutions. If 9F is that interesting Natasha, you can join them. Sorry sir. Madam please, go easy, they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G! Madam please, go easy, they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G! I'm little Tamil boy straight from Chennai to Dharavi. I'm too local, don't mess with me and get killed. I'll pop like soda bottle instantly if you test me. I'm a little boy but still I'll wear my dhothi above my knee. Sachin is the star of cricket. But Rajinikanth is a superstar. And it's us when it's all hip hop wicked and wild in this city. Madam please, go easy, they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G! Madam please, go easy, they're Wi-Fi, we're 3G! So, are you able to tolerate 9F? Sir, they're not that bad. I don't know, if they'll be able to tolerate me. FYI, that book isn't in the 9th grade syllabus. I told you Ms. Mathur, they don't belong here. I'm sorry you had to suffer because of them. Principal sir also agrees, they need to be suspended. Yeah. Sir, it's just so embarrassing sir. Actually I was trying to explain... ...how Liquid Nitrogen expands in my Chemistry class. I'm so sorry, I didn't realize it will explode. I'm just so sorry sir. They didn't do anything. What exactly are you trying to prove Ms. Mathur! You think we're all fools? The whole school should suffer because of 9F? Get to your classes. Move. Ms. Mathur, we all know this is their doing. You do too. You're still protecting them! Yes sir. Like you said, we all know this prank might be their doing. But sir, what they did requires planning, foresight, intelligence. Sir, I believe if we can find a way to channelize this energy correctly, they can make St. Notker's proud one day... I assure you sir. It's a fool's dream Ms. Mathur. They don't belong here. They never did and never will. They will sir. Maybe we just haven't tried hard enough - they do belong. Are you challenging me? They just need some time... and effort sir. How much time? Huh? Set a deadline. For 9F, and yourself. Sir, 4 months. Till the final exams. And after 4 months? Sir, after the exams the results will speak for themselves. You can do what seems right. But I get the next 4 months - no questions asked. Please sir. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Hurts the ear, doesn't it? I used to hear this in school. 17 years later, I heard this noise again, from the chalk, and from you all. This is what you all have been doing, right? In school - in life... Just screeching. What're you trying to prove? That no one can break you!? It might come as a surprise to you... ...that nobody here is interested in breaking you. But yeah... we are interested in teaching you. You know what's amazing about this chalk? If you break a small part from the tip... It stops screeching. A tiny piece. A small change. That's the difference between 'why' and 'why not'. Final exams are 4 months away. Now, you all have to decide - if you want to make that small change... ...or just keep screeching? I'll see you guys, at exactly 9 tomorrow. If you guys aren't here, I'll hand over my resignation to the Principal at 9:10. But if you guys are here, then we'll start over. Not with 'Why', with 'why not'. Naina ma'am is right. If we really wanna make some noise, let's pass the final exam. Ms. Stammer is now ma'am?! If it wasn't for her, we'd be suspended! So?! You want to become a lab rat for her Science project?! I think none of us should show up tomorrow. Why're you guys not in school? The Greek professor is known for... Visionary poets of America. ...but away from each other. What is this force called? Shall we begin with Maths, today? Like every year, St. Notker's honours the students... ...who have set new standards for academic excellence. I would like to request, Head of the Student Council Mr. Wadia, to present the top students with Prefect Badges... and to say a few words on this occasion. Sunidhi Prabhakaran - 9A, Natasha Khanna - 9A, Akshay Verma - 9A, Saad Mainani - 9A. People look for role models in history. But your role models are in front of you. To share the stage with such top students must be your aim. And the students on this stage, you need to fulfill the responsibilities of this Prefect Badge. The responsibility of being a true St. Notkerite. When in doubt, remember: the badge isn't for you - you are for the badge. Here? C'mon in. Come, Come. Quickly take your seats. Let's have our class here today. Isn't it lovely? And today, we'll try a new roll call. Ready?! Aatish. Killam, Oru. Tamannah, Ashwin, Ravinder, Raghu. Tara, Shagufta, Pankaj. Well done my precious eggs! Full attendance. The eggs are boiled, you can eat them if you like. The egg could've gone anywhere in the air, but all of you caught it. Mathematically speaking... ...the equation of the egg's flight is called Parabola. You caught the egg without reading the equation, means you'll are already Mathematicians. We get an egg everyday now? Now you just need to learn the equation. Yes ma'am, only Oru doesn't understand. She jumped out of the way! No. I can't touch eggs on Tuesdays! But Oru taught us some Physics. Oru applied force to get out of the way. Force=Mass x Acceleration. Oru's taught us Newton's Law of Motion. Walking, sitting, getting up, running we learn all of this early on. Now just learn it as an equation. Ma'am, if we know everything already... ...then why are we wasting our time in school? I can walk in a straight line anytime. What say Pankaj? Shouldn't you be in class? Ya! Sorry sir. You're not getting what I'm trying to say. We can try all we want ma'am, but we'll never become 9A. And we don't want to either. This Prefect Badge is just one big drama! And what was that- when in doubt, remember, the badge is not for you, you are for the badge. True that ma'am, it's just all politics. Basically, I'm not the only one with Tourette's over here. Madam please. Your Tourette's theory is cute, but practical life is quite different. What's the big deal about them anyway?! It's just a Badge! It's not about the Prefect Badge. You can be your own Badge if you want. You just need equal opportunities... What equal opportunities ma'am? I bet 9A has maids and servants to even wash their bums. And ma'am, we need to stand in a 50 meter long line, just to take a dump! This school and its teachers will never let us become Prefects. Sir, you wanted to see me? Yes Mr. Wadia, please sit down. Ms. Mathur wants 9F to be eligible for Prefectship. You're joking, right sir? No! What's so funny Mr. Wadia? Technically Prefectship is for everyone. So, 9F should also get the chance. As St. Notkerites, they're also eligible for Prefectship. Or are you worried sir, someone from 9F will become a Prefect? Hmmm. Eligibility for Prefectship right? Well, as head of Student Council, I have no objection. But I hope you know... a student has to score above 90% in the final to be eligible for Prefectship. 'Above 90%'. There you are, above 90%. Yes sir. Thank you. Ms. Mathur trust me, it's enough if 9F can just pass. Especially given the way you're teaching them. Sir, has Ms. Mathur shared her methods with you? Today, in the playground, she began the class with eggs. Went on to Parabola, Maths. Then suddenly she shifted to Physics and Newton's laws. Was it a Maths class or Physics, or cooking class? I'm so glad you're interested in my teaching methods Mr. Wadia. Sir, in the real world, life doesn't test us subject-wise. So Ms. Mathur, it's now your exam, as much as theirs! Whether you like it or not, they will be tested in the classroom... ...on the exam day! And don't worry, the day a student from 9F scores 90% - I'll pin that badge on them, myself. Thank you, sir! Mr. Wadia, make sure you have more than one badge ready. Good day, sir! Listen up and listen hard, we gonna blow your brains apart. Yo mamma, you better remember my name, Imma rob you blind, that the name of ma game. Hold onto your belt and knickers, we gonna rock so hard, you gonna look so lame. Hold onto your belt and knickers, we gonna rock so hard, you gonna look so lame. Hello, how are you? Hi. Aman is a topper. - She really works hard. - Well done Natasha. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, sir. - Hello ma'am. - Good morning. Harshad right? Just needs to pay attention. Thank you so much. Thank you. So how was your PTM? 5 cups of tea... and 0 parents. Oh. You conduct classes in the playground, isn't it! Maybe your Parent Teachers' Meet should be in every kid's house? No? Finally, Mr. Wadia... you and me agree on something. Thank you! Good afternoon, ma'am. Keep your eyes open, blink too much and your money flies. Here's my 20! Gimme your money! UP there? Ravinder?! Naina ma'am, what're you doing here? All okay? Why didn't you get your parents to the PTM? Run! The cops are here. The cops are here, run! Hey Ravinder, stop! Catch him. Ravinder! Ravinder... Ma'am, why're you here? - Tara! - Today's a holiday no? Holiday? It's Parents-Teacher Meet! Your parents didn't come? Mom's working at the fish market, and Dad's not with us. Oh! I'm sorry Tara, I didn't know... He's not dead! Just doesn't live with us. C'mon, c'mon. Driver side. Go, go, 90, 9°- Right, right, right. Ma'am, what's up? Oru! - Mummy... - Hello! Your place also didn't get water? Ma. Ashwin! This is our stall! Ma, this is our school teacher. Hello! Ma'am, my son's like a Jackfruit. He has a tough shell, but he's all soft inside. Look after him ma'am. Ma, she doesn't know jackfruit! - You've never eaten jackfruit? - No! Madam, I drive the baggage trolley at the Airport. I want my Shagufta to fly that Aircraft I load that luggage in... ...that's what makes me work hard everyday. Madam, you are a ray of hope for us... There is a whole world outside these slums... ...we just want our kids to get an opportunity... ...to do what we could never do. Killam. Killam! Come, come, come. Sit down. Ravinder, come here. Come, sit. Ashwin. So today, Ravinder will teach the class. How much do you make at that card game? If you don't mind me asking. 8 a month? Sometimes 12... Thousand? Not bad. I was wondering if you could teach all of us. Don't pull my leg, ma'am. No, really. Oru, give me the calculator. We're 15 including me. 15 times 8 thousand. 120,000. Hmm. And if some of us are caught... so what? It's part of the job. Say 3 of us are caught. Bail will be 6350 per person. We're left with... 100,950. If we divide this by 15? 6730. But ma'am what's your point? That you are able to do complicated calculations on your own... ...faster than even a calculator! And yet you keep failing in Mathematics. Isn't that weird? Ravinder... you have a gift. Use it wisely. Ma'am, what's he gonna get from studying? Maybe a Graduate degree? He's already making more than the graduates in our slums, who sell detergents door-to-door. I don't want to sell no detergents ma'am! Who's asking you to sell detergents? You wanna bet, learn to bet legally. Not this petty roadside gambling... ...but the largest level of gambling in the world. Learn to bet on the stock markets. Who knows? You could become an investment banker! But for that, you'll have to prepare. You'll have to study. Ma'am, he's good at math, he has a gift. What about the rest of us? Yes ma'am, only some kids in a school can be intelligent, the rest have to be useless no? She's right ma'am. I am dead sure, I'm completely useless. My Science, Maths, even Geography is a giant, oval zero. Just like my tummy! Killam, you work in a garage right? Why does a car go faster in the 4th gear than in the 2nd? Ma'am, because the 4th gear has less friction, so the wheel moves faster! That's Physics. Tamannah... when do you add salt to your ladies-fingers? At the start? Never at the start ma'am. Always at the end. If you add it at the start, it gets watery and sticky. Adding salt releases moisture in anything. That's Chemistry. If you ask me, you're all experts of your own subjects. But there's one more thing you're all masters of- Of blaming your situations. Open the last page of your notebooks. Take 10 minutes and think... ...about the one thing that you fear... ...hate about yourself. Now write it down on that page. Come on! The story of your life is stuck on this page... full of your fears. But if you accept this fear... this truth... ...will become the wind beneath your wings. Hmm? Come with me! From today, these fears will be your strength... not weakness! Let them go, and you will fly with them. - Thermometer please. - The Infra red one. - Sir, the Basketball. - Take it. Sir, we need the weighing machine. The eight seas, and a million skies. You have to scan, with your own eyes. Search your heart, and dust your soul. Look under every rock, leave no stone unturned. Who's unwell? The basketball. Behave yourself Akshay. Spread your wings, see how high you soar. Spread your wings, see how high you soar. When the ball bounces, potential energy transforms into kinetic and heat energy. Why can't our experiments be like that? Yes sir, it's the same syllabus no? Why can't we also have some fun? Excellence, my dear, is not fun... it's hard work. St. Notker's has great expectations from 9A, not 9F. Let's go. To this world, you pay no heed. Your crazy heart always was... ...and still is a crazy breed. You have to change minds, make them come around. In the sky, you're gonna break new ground. Spread your wings, see how high you soar. Hold the beaker. Stretch it. Water attracts water - Cohesion. The thread attracts water - Adhesion. A broken clock, can also chime... ...twice a day, it's right on time! Let the heart sing, don't you shut up. Don't hold back, it's just a hiccup. Bro, is there Cohesion between you and Natasha or Adhesion? Spread your wings, see how high you soar. Did you guys know! At the time sailors and captains didn't have a compass... ...they placed their hands like this to find their way. The Pole star showed them the way. What is this?! Sometimes I feel, all Wadia sir cares about is marks, and this stupid Project! Listen. He just wants us to be the best, you know. In fact we should feel lucky that we have him. Yeah. We're luckier... but they are definitely happier. Come on, come on. Come, come, come. Thank you, ma'am. Bye. Hi! Hello. You... err, going home? I'm working on the science project. It's almost done. Want to see? - Huh? - Want to see it? ' Ya, ya. - Let's go? Come. Please come na... See... Look here... we've put solar panels here. And you know photo-voltaic principle... Don't bother Natasha - they won't understand all this. Maybe if it was a 'solar slum', they'd get it? AkShay! So how's your basketball training with that 'Naina madam' going? The solar panels in your model are facing in the wrong direction. The panels should face south... like windows used to, of the houses in Greek and Roman cities! Your Sun's position is fixed. Just tilt your solar panels by 19 degrees. Hmm. Tamannah! How did you do that? I mean where did you learn that? While playing basketball. Hey Akshay! I'm not getting this equation ya! Don't know what's wrong, maybe the data is wrong? Hang on. I think you should try Planck's equation, not Einstein. Give me. So Planck's equation has 'h' as a constant... I'm trying, but it won't fix. Try this once. It's an adhesive. What's going on? Hmm? What's this? It's mine. We use it to fix a tyre puncture... at my cycle shop. My team and I are making a project for the 'National' Science Fair - not fixing tyre punctures here! I'm sorry, did I puncture your ego? It's a good thing you know how to fix punctures. No? Get out! Aatish, are you crying? You mad or what? Hey Killam, do you have sunglasses? What for? There's too much light coming from there man! I think I'll go blind. Oh! It's from the Prefect Badge! Must be Wadia's wedding gift to his young bride! You saying Akshay is Wadia's bride? "Sir, sir, how can I keep my badge shiny and bright?" "Well son, every morning when you wake up, kiss it once... like you kiss my bum!" Aatish... Aatish. Aatish. Stop it, stop it. Aatish! You two! Back to the class! Ma'am, why're you taking his side? Let it be Killam. She's the same as those other teachers! Aatish, I heard what you said to Akshay! Just like Wadia sir has made up his mind, to single out 9F, you too have made up your mind to humiliate Akshay. Then why do you keep crying that 'St. Notker's will never accept us'... '9A will never accept us'? Don't make me say a word more. Go back to class! What will you say anyway?! Can you even speak properly? You'll hiccup 4 times before you say 2 words. I don't even know if this is a school or a circus. Aatish! You two, go to class, go to class right now! You should've slapped him, Ms. Mathur. I've never raised my hand on a student till date. But don't worry, 9F deserves it. Am glad you've finally realized it. 9F. They're not fit to be students. You know what Mr. Wadia. There are no bad students - only bad teachers. Whatever happened... or happens, is between 9F and me. That's between them and me. I am still their teacher and they're still my class. Hi... so my order you've got a little well done. - Ma'am? Same for me please. And give me some of that mash. Ma'am, what would you like to have? Umm... I'll have... I'll have... Pasta. Fettuccini. White sauce. Grilled Chicken, no Pepper. She's allergic to Pepper. Okay. Right! I remember. - All right, sir. Thank you. - Thank you. Your restaurant's getting quite popular. I checked online... good ratings! You should come sometime. If you have the time, that is... Naina, thanks for inviting me. Wasn't me who invited you. How's school going Naina? Does it matter? Can't we speak normally? Normal! Dad, this is my normal. I don't think you can handle my normal. What exactly is your problem? My problem is that... I don't need you to place my order for me, and I don't need you to get me a bank job. I just want you to... Just calm down. Calm down. - Birthday Cake. - Please come. Fine. Cut the cake first, and then each other's throats? Let's just all pretend to be a normal family. Blow the candles first. Didi? Hard luck. No, no! Sorry. It's okay. Even Papa will remember this birthday. - Good morning, sir. - Mr. Wadia, all set? - Absolutely sir. - We're waiting to see it! Yes, sure. Good morning. Yes, Akshay. You may begin. Good afternoon everyone. When the sunrays fall on the photovoltaic material, it transforms into electricity. And that is the principal that is used to create solar cell. We will first see the practical and then we will talk about it in detail. So let's assume this Halogen bulb is the Sun. When we the sunrays fall perpendicularly on the glass... ...we will see maximum absorption. Wow. What's happening? Kids, are you okay? I'm sorry everybody, my apologies. Please excuse us. Mr. Wadia, please do something about it. Very sorry sir. What happened? Sir, we don't know sir, we even did multiple checks sir. Yes sir, it was all okay! - Are you sure you checked everything? - Yes sir, I did it myself. The fan, windmill... train, everything sir! Sir, I don't know how this happened sir. Who was able to solve this equation I gave yesterday? Yes ma'am, I got it. Okay, show me. Yes sir?! Sir? Hey! I think this belongs to you? What happened, sir? Sir. What's up sir? Hope I didn't puncture your ego? Aatish! Sorry ma'am, I forgot. Sir doesn't even know how to fix a puncture. Be quiet, Aatish. Right sir? Sir. Ms. Mathur, you'll be happy to know... that St. Notker's pride and project have been blown to pieces... ...and your brilliant class is responsible for it. You were right, you know, there are no bad students, only hopeless ones. Who else was a part of this? Mr. Wadia... it can't be... Killam... Sir. Sir, will you please tell me - Ms. Mathur, get ready to teach an empty classroom. Today will be 9F's last day, in this school. I'll see you in the Principal's office. It took 6 months to make that project. It's destroyed! Along with St. Notker's reputation, because of your 9F. Tell me one good reason why 9F should stay in this school... ...for even a second more? Killam and I did it! Why did all of you have to take the blame? Oh, now you're worried about us? What about what Naina ma'am is going through, because of you two? But first we have to get it approved by Wadia sir. Looks like, Principal sir is giving you the Prefect Badges?! Aatish! Let it go! Get lost. Good luck! Sir, you can give them any punishment you want, but don't rusticate them sir! Please sir, just let them give the exams. Sir, this is ridiculous! Let's be realistic. Do you think 9F can even pass the exam? Sir, I don't have the answers to these questions. This isn't just about the exams, it's about their future sir. Please. Sir, I think this is - They can give the exams. But they can't come to school till then. They're suspended from the school, till the exams begin. They're a bad influence on other students. . - Z- I understand, sir! Thank you, sir. Ms. Mathur, you're a good teacher, but you're stuck with the wrong class. And that's not your fault - it's mine. I gave you that class. I'm worried, we're going to lose a good teacher along with 9F. Good day, sir. You guys can give the exam. Thank you, ma'am. Ma'am, we're going to toil day-n-night from today. - I'll put up a timetable - - That won't be necessary. You can't come to school before the exams. Anyway, I don't think you guys need me anymore. - All the best. - Ma'am. Good riddance. Ms. Stammer! Aatish, that's enough of your nonsense! You think you broke Wadia's project?! You've broken Naina ma'am's trust! You've broken 9F! At least she stammers with her mouth but you stammer from your heart. Maybe Dad and Wadia sir are right. Maybe my methods are wrong. Relax Didi, it happens. Your date's here. Please handle it. Calm down. Just... She had a bad day, at school. Ma'am... that day, on the terrace, when we threw those rockets... Ma'am both our pages were empty. Only the two of us didn't write anything. You were right ma'am. Our lives are stuck on that last page. Remember ma'am, you asked us... ...to write down our biggest fear. I do fear ma'am... I am afraid that... I'll never be as good as 9A. But what I fear most is... ...to trust someone. Anyone. Even myself... ...or you. That you would leave us too. Here's my page, ma'am. I've written all of it down. I can make it fly ma'am... ...but this rocket doesn't know it's way. You told us the Pole Star, stays where it is... ...and guides ships. I don't know about the sky ma'am, but on this earth you are my Pole Star - you are our guiding light ma'am. Osmosis with an egg. Remove the cell of an egg by dissolving... it in 40% dilute hydrochloric acid, that is the plasma membrane... put the egg in pure water. And what do you observe people, what do you observe. What do you observe people, what do you observe? With every breath I take, I wonder if this is a mistake... My hiccup's calling. My hiccup's calling. She's one half - a golden heart, another - a stubborn upstart, My hiccup's calling. It's calling. I'll come back early for a few days, so you can study. When lightening strikes, it's seen first, then heard... ...because light travels faster than sound. Ma'am, light's gone travelling again! If your ship's lost at sea, the storm inside is all you can see. This hiccup's your boat. This hiccup keeps you afloat. Two ratios, 5 upon 10 and 60 upon 120. It's the same page. Where are you looking? Can you see this? My hiccup's calling. What's going on? Start studying, come on! Out, out! - I'll just... - Get in. My hiccup's calling. It's calling. My hiccup's calling. My brain is even thicker than I am bro! You're not alone, bro. Aatish, if we fail Naina ma'am's going to lose face. She and all of 9F will become a joke, for Wadia and the school. Hey Aatish, can you check the rear tyre? I think the pressure is low. Exams are close, your pressure also seems low? Science and Maths question paper? Want them? Hmm? Raghu... Tara... The real blessings are here. Tomorrow's question papers! Here. Have you lost your mind Aatish?! What's wrong with you? WhY YOU getting mad? I'm not doing this for myself. If we fail, Naina ma'am will also fail. Ya? And this is how we win? By cheating? If Naina ma'am finds out... So who's gonna tell Naina ma'am?! Not me, not you! We all know what our chances are. Am I doing this for me?! I'm doing this for all of us... ...for Naina ma'am too! You're hopeless Aatish. You've lost your mind. She's gonna fail. I'm glad at least you guys get it. You can start writing, now. Sir... is this the paper? This is a totally different paper man! All good? All the best for tomorrow. Sir. Stop. Stop writing. No, no, no. That's enough. It's time. Give, give, give! - How was the paper? - Pretty good. Miss... miss... Very good, very good, you wrote this? What did you mark here? Ma'am, don't you worry. We've written all the answers. All of us will pass. No tension! Sure?! I passed. Congratulations bro! Me too! And presenting, the new topper of St. Notker's this year - Ms. Oru! - No! Even I didn't know! - Dude, Oru has topped the school! Thank you. Where is Killam? I don't know how man... but, even I passed! Cigarettes and chillum, congratulations Killam! Excuse me, sir? I've been teaching for 20 years! I know when students have cheated. Sure, they could've passed. But suddenly they've topped? And that too only in Science and Maths? The great Ms. Mathur's subjects? Magic. Sir, they've worked hard sir. Or cheated hard? Sir, the answers are right, but there is no working. If there are workings, they're not part of the syllabus. How did they get these answers? No idea. This can only happen, if you know the questions, and the answers are rote. I know my teaching methods are different... out of box even. But that doesn't mean 9F has cheated. There are many ways to get to a solution Mr. Wadia! Why is only your method correct? Or is that written in the syllabus also? The question papers were leaked Ms. Mathur. Aatish and Killam came to Shyamlal peon for the leaked question papers. Is that one of the out-of-the-box solutions you taught 9F?! Out! Ms. Mathur, your students are failures! And will remain so! Sir, 9F is municipality garbage that's making all of St. Notker's rot! Please Mr. Wadia! Mind your language. You're talking about students of St. NOtker's! Not anymore Ms. Mathur. Tomorrow, in the assembly they will be expelled. To set an example that... St. Notker's cannot and will not be a school for cheaters. Sir, I believe my students have not cheated. I think I've heard enough Ms. Mathur. You can leave now. Ma'am... Ma'am, I agree we got the question papers. But I swear ma'am, we didn't cheat ma'am! Ma'am, say something ma'am... why aren't you scolding us? Because I know none of you has cheated. Otherwise all of you would've topped like Oru. Anyway, it doesn't matter what I think. It matters to us ma'am. Ma'am, we are your students first, then St. Notkers'. Sudha and Vinay told me what happened in school today. You must be happy. I'll lose my teaching job. You're here with another banking job? Naina, you're getting me wrong. Aren't you tired of this pretence, Dad? Who are we fooling? Each other? Or ourselves?! What do you think, Dad? You can walk out of our lives whenever you want... ...and waltz back in, when you feel? You left us, Dad. Remember. You left us. Now just stay out! You know for any parent... ...for a father... what's most important? Being able to solve any problem, your family... ...your child faces. I could never solve your Tourette's. I wanted to fix it. It didn't need fixing dad. It's who I am. It will always be who I am! Look... whatever happens in school tomorrow, you don't have to prove anything to anyone. I saw those kids... ...what you did for them, I could never do that for you. You stood by them. I'm proud of you! Sir. What are you thinking? Too bad. We couldn't participate in the National Science Fair this year. But we have a bigger victory, sir! We threw 9F out of the school after all. We? Ya, I mean, that's what you wanted, right sir? SO I did it! I sent Shyamlal to Aatish and Killam, with the wrong papers. So all of 9F learns the wrong answers... and fails. They didn't fail, but who cares! At least they're out of St. Notker's. And look, sir! In the end, the Prefect Badge stays in 9A. I promise sir, we got 9F this year, next year we'll get the National Science Fair also. I'll see you in class. As you are all aware, what 9F has done... ...is completely unacceptable. We have come to a decision. 9F can no longer be a part of St. NOtker's. I request Mr. Wadia to continue with the proceedings. When I was young, I used to think being a teacher is the most difficult thing. After teaching for 20 years, I've learnt... ...there is something even more difficult... ...being a student. A student can lose marks for learning something wrong, but a teacher never loses marks for teaching something wrong. Teaching is easy... Learning is hard. We all want to teach others something. I too set out to teach 9F something... ...that they aren't good enough for St. NOtker's. And you know how easy it was to do that? So easy that I... ...leaked the wrong question papers to Shyamlal. So that all of 9F will learn the wrong questions... ...and fail in the exam. Not because they were failures, but because I wanted them to be failures. Ms. Mathur, 9F may we please have you on stage? Come. There are some teachers who simplify learning for their students, no matter how difficult it is to teach. Ms. Mathur. Do the honours please. Sir. Ms. Mathur, you were right. There are no bad students - just bad teachers. Sir... sir! Sir, I don't think you leaked the question papers. Ms. Mathur, even I don't think you planned that... ...window burst in class! I don't think all the scores are settled sir. We still need to complete the National Science Fair hat-trick. Sir, it's not as posh as your project, but I swear some of the parts we've used... ...are straight out of real automobiles! Equations in the syllabus stayed the same, but the equations between the kids did change. There were even, some new equations. Like me, everyone made friends with their Tourette's. I wonder what TOurette's really is? Just some tics? Or is it how we think about life? Of course, it's about 'how we think'! Because the difference between "why" and "Why not", is just that... a hiccup. Today, I'm retiring from St. Notker's. And just like that twenty years passed trying to grasp these equations. 25 years. Just trying to make sure no hiccup goes unheard. Every dream you dream will come true. Have heart, dear heart... just a little longer. Who you are, will shine through. Have heart, my dear heart... a little bit longer. The feet that walk a million mile, sleep sound with a smile. The feet that walk a million mile, sleep sound with a smile. Live a life so full of wonder, a story everyone will remember. Darkness whispers to the sky, a star shines within every firefly. Don't cry those precious tears. Don't blame your worst fears. Live a life so full of wonder, a story everyone will remember. Hear what every mistake screams to you, lessons only blunders can teach you. Don't let anger get to your mind, rage will cause the heart to go blind. Don't cry those precious tears. Don't blame your worst fears. Live a life so full of wonder, a story everyone will remember.
