My new raw candy. -Helena. It's excellent. -Isn't it? You're great. I know. -Oh... I'm sorry. -It's OK. -Here, it's basswood. -No, thank you. Mom! Mom! It’s snowing outside! We'll go bobsleighing to Petřín. You don't have the snow pants, do you? You'd catch a cold. It is Christmas. So keep it on. Not apples again. I already had some today. One apple, my daily dose of vitamin C, and a carton of cocoa drink for magnesium. Don't ridicule it. You know that to keep your body as strong as can be, eating healthy is the key. So eat. Let's keep our fingers crossed. If they like it today we will get the contract for two years not just for this one episode. Now we jinxed it. Did you get the celery? -I was just going to get it. -Go on then. Don't forget celery is a small miracle. The scientists found out that celery contains a substance that regulates both the men's and women's hormones. In addition, it fights frigidity, eliminates impotency and boosts fertility. Getting the mix right isn't easy. But you will manage if you stick to the old saying that repetition is the mother of learning, practice makes perfect and it leads to I'll probably come to visit this Christmas. George. ...mastery. ...practice leads to mastery. Here comes the vitamin miracle! Bummer. Let's pack it up. Hi, Helena. I'll pass you on. Helena, what's going on? I am reducing Mrs. Libuška from size 10 to 6. I am only on size 8 so hold on. Judging from how disgusting this looks it really must be good for you. I can almost feel my hormones getting in balance. So your belly's fine for at least two years. And next week we will do your face, eyelids and cleavage. Give Mrs. Liduška this stretch marks cream. What do I have for tomorrow? Two bellies, three pairs of thighs and one back. Ok, thank you. Hi. So what is it going to be today? -Hi, Ella. -Jeez, what happened? Voilà. Again? What a moron. This time because of Nickie. -You are not gonna fall for it again! -Of course not. Last year he promised to come for Christmas but didn't show up. You sat there waiting for him like idiots. Helena, don't be a fool. I know I'm being stupid, he probably won't turn up, I know he's a moron, but he's still Nick's biological father and he shouldn't just vanish from his life. Maybe he's changed.Some peoples’ lives are more complicated. Only if he has undergone a lobotomy. Oh, I have an idea. Why don't you and Nickie go away for Christmas this year. And just forget about that idiot. You'll go to Tatras. I couldn't do this to my mom, just leave for Christmas. You know what she is like. Please, just don't tell her about this idea. -I thought you were a big girl now. -I am big. Bigger than you. -Well excuse me... -Yes, I am. And someone should take care of that organic terrorism business of yours. It's called a healthy balanced diet. Someone calls it a balanced diet, someone organic terrorism. It doesn't matter. It does matter. It's a big difference. Good evening. Mr. Novotny. I have my new raw candy for you. Don't forget it is the best for your diabetes. I know, Helena. -Merry Christmas. -Happy Christmas to you. Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way! Is this merry Andrew or Saint Nicholas? Grandma and Grandpa are here! They were here just now, St. Nicholas and his angel. No kidding. They have gone already? This is not for me anymore. I hope this is the last time. But Dad, Nicholas likes it. He does? Nicholas doesn't believe in Nicholas. -Was he? And the angel too? -Yeah! And what did he bring you? All kinds of things, but this is for Granny and this for Grandpa. -He thought of us too. -And for Mummy. -And this is for you, auntie. -Oh, thanks. He didn't forget about your aunt either. Oh Jesus, it's really disgusting. Hm, it's interesting, hm. This candy's gonna be the hit of this Christmas. Here, Natalie. What's wrong? Come love, let's find trash for crap food. What's the name of your neighbor's chihuahua? -Natalie. -Natalie. The chihuahua found some tidbit, gobbled it up and it started all shaking, the hair on its back standing up and then it just laid there... dead. Eyes all popped out... and suddenly its paws went up... and up and it began to shiver, and then it just shook it off and walked away. It experienced its rebirth. It experienced agony but a rebirth it was. It came as a chihuahua and left as St. Bernard. But we will have the usual Christmas sweets and potato salad? Don't worry Joe, I have already started baking. And no green peas in the salad this year. Well I think Helena and Nick won't have any potato salad. -What do you mean? -So don't make the salad at all. She was going to tell us that they wouldn't be with us this Christmas. Where should they be? Family must be together for Christmas. I was going to give you this beautiful set that you liked so much, as a wedding gift. Or as a special occasion gift. Or as a Christmas gift this year. But you'd have to be here. Otherwise Little Jesus will give this beautiful set to Ella instead. Oh, please, don't drag Little Jesus into this. I don't really need it. I hardly ever cook. -Helena doesn't cook either. -Dad... Oh, come on. I just wanted to persuade her to give this beautiful dinner set with the soup bowl to you. -It used to belong to her mother. -No. Your mother. -It was your mother's! -No, no, no. -All right. -It was our mother's? What do you mean your mother's? Her mother's. -Oh come on... -So whose mother's was it? It doesn't matter whose mother's. It's old. So who's the terrorist here? You've taught me my whole life everybody should live the way they like. So now you explain it to my mom. Oh come on. Have you ever seen me being able to to explain anything to your mother? No, no, no, no! Watch out! Mommy, wake up! Watch out! An avalanche! I'm sorry. It's the mountains that's on my mind and it's snowing outside. Well, if you mean those three sad snowflakes then there is a snowdrift in the street. Last year you dreamt about tsunami and I wasn't allowed even in an inflatable pool. Nature is dangerous, Nickie. Look Mom, if you don't wanna ski you don't have to. I'll learn it by myself. I'm not going to ski for sure. -So... -So. So let's go to sleep. It's a school night, you know. -Are we going to read a chapter? -Yeah! So where have we finished? 326? -327. -Can I come in? First asteroid was occupied by a king. King in a purple coat. That's lovely. He was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic. -Here is a subject, exclaimed the king. -Grandpa. Sleeping time. Just for a minute. Could you order 10 pounds of beetroot and 4 pounds of fresh spinach. And parsley, of course. -Coffee for you. Sugar? -No. Would you like some other refreshments? -I would like a chocolate. -All right. -And crisps. -You have the pea crisps? -Yes. -Thank you. It wasn't meant to you. We won't be adding any pea chips to our menu. Leave the menu as it is, we don't wanna experiment now. Our train has just left. Excuse me, we just missed our train. When is the next one due? -We need to get to the Grand Hotel. -At five in the morning. What are we gonna do now? Excuse me, do you need any advice? Or help? Welcome to the Grand Hotel. It's grand. We have a booking here for Helena Troy. -So, enjoy your stay and happy vacation. -Thank you very much! You're welcome. I thought we would never get here. Do we still have time for the pool? Of course. Wellness is waiting for you. Help yourself to a welcome drink. I am really sorry but is there any chance that you have changed your reservation? -I can't see your name in here. -No, I did the booking myself. Here it is. Oh, I see. You do have a reservation, but it's for next year. I don't believe it. You could have realized that I wanted to come this Christmas. What can I do now? -Have you got any other rooms? -The Post Hotel is full, as is Grand Jasna. You know what? Go to the Church. They have a nice advent concert there. Just relax and I'll see what I can do. You can leave your luggage here. Granny and Grandpa would like this, wouldn't they? I'm sorry but I didn't find anything. We are not going home. You've promised me mountains, Mom. Yeah, beautiful birdie. Yes, do hang it up. -I think it is a bit overdone. -It isn't. I'm over squatted. -Hi. -You know what I did? I screwed up the booking and now we don't have anywhere to stay. There is no available accommodation around here. -Hey, sis? Who's calling? -Eugene! So much for your idea sending us to High Tatras. Eugene? Fight, Eugene, or you’ll have to have that dining set. It would be a miracle to find anything here. -Hallo. Ella? -Hi Dad! Excuse me but your calling for a miracle couldn't be overheard. I'm sorry I'm yelling here but we are in a deep sh... shade. We usually don't interfere with God's work but since it is Christmas... If you don't mind modest conditions you could stay in the parsonage till tomorrow. -I will prepare the guest room for you. -Nickie, we are saved. Jasna 07. There are two free riders in the avalanche chute. Jasna 07. There are two free riders in the avalanche chute. -014? -Jasna 1. The alert is on. Roger. I'm on my way. I'm sorry. 07, all right. I'm calling 05. 05 here, roger. On my way. 09. I hear you. On my way. On my way. -Hi, guys. -Hi. -Hi bro. -Hello Rick. -Hello. -How does it look? -We'll see. The dog handler goes first. Pastor? -You'll be an observer. -Sure. All right, let's do it as usual. Now! We are behind you. Let's go. Step up and jab! The Czechs again... The dog handler! Follow me! Search! Go! Help him please. Can you hear me? Are you with me? -You'll take the Praguer to your place? -Ok, but I am doing this for you. Don't worry. God will remember it. One Christmas won't kill you. -And say hello to Suzy. -And you to your girls. You should come to see us more often. So Suzy would have someone to play with. -Come down with us. -No, I'm going home to Suzy. -No? -No. -OK. See you, thanks. -See you. -They don't appreciate you enough. -For the rescuers. Stop by the parsonage in the morning. You'll take the guests to Richard. To my brother. For Christmas. I've persuaded him. Wanna have chapped lips? No, you don't. -What a calm scene, hm? -Beautiful. Beautiful. Yes, it is. I told you it is a paradise here. And I will drop in now and then to make this paradise even better for you. -Could you make paradise any better? -Just wait and see. -A power station? -A transmitter. A nice one, huh? We're the kings of the mountains, Dad! It's wonderful! Suzy! -You're almost as good as your dad. -Well, she's my blood, isn't she? -Are we gonna do this too, Mom? -No, don't worry Nick. -What a shame. -Only when your mom isn't looking. -I've brought the guests, bro. -Hello. I'm Helena and this is Nickie. -Hickie. -Nicholas. Berger and Berger. Well, we don't have no catwalk here, madam. -What's this? -These are people, bro. These are not normal people. You're lucky I promised the pastor. -Otherwise... -All right, all right. -Apparently it will count up there. -Yeah, sure. I'm looking forward to it. Are you gonna come in for tea or are you in a hurry? Oh, you want me to stick around the lady? You'd have to sit her kid for a long time. See you. -Do you have everything? -Yeah. So don't forget. Tomorrow I'll pick you up here and we'll go skiing. It's gonna be tough with them. Have fun! So come in. Kid, the skis go over there. Your room's upstairs, the fire is ready but the wood's outside; in the shed. Breakfast is at 7 AM. If you miss it you'll have to make it yourself. Everything clear? Would you please help me with that luggage? Hm, the Praguers arrived. In the mountains everybody must be able to take care of themselves. Hm, so we are colour coded. Nice. Oh, so high. It's better than the hotel. Right, Mom? It is fabulous here. Atishoo! Bless me. I am not having this. Do you know what's with Helena? I keep calling her but she's not picking up. Don't worry. Next Christmas we'll be together. If I live that long. She's feeding us with those sprouts. I suffer hardship, Jane. I suffer. You only think about yourself. This is about our daughter and our grandson. Stay calm. They're in a luxury hotel. -With a pool. -With a pool? -Maybe she'll meet a man there. -What man? A real man. -What? -Excuse me. I am really grateful that you put us up but my son can't stay in such a cold room. -You don't know how to make fire? -We've tried but... But what? You have some chippings and matches, the wood is outside in the shed. So? Let's go. What are you writing there? Lately she stressed to you several times she doesn't want any man! Right, Sigmund? Endogenous depression. You didn't know that yet. Hysteria and neurosis, that you knew, right? I should've been in Grand's wellness room now. He thinks I can't do it? Well, he's wrong. What did he say? In the mountains everybody has to take care of themselves. -So it's my turn -I should go. But you've already been. But I... I am not little anymore, am I. No Nickie, you're not. You're clumsy. Let's go, you'll sweep it later. So your name is Nickie? -I don't like my mom calling me that. -You are also a mama's boy. -No, I'm not! -All of you city guys are mama's boys. That's not true. -And you can't do anything. -Cool. I can do many things. And quite well. -Yeah, like chopping wood. -Sure thing. -Watch me. -Let me see. -Not much to see there. -Well, today I'm not too good. I'm probably weakened by the mountain air. My grandpa would say that. He's a doctor. Sure. And what else can you do “quite well”? Connection check. Sixteen's reporting in, the hamlet is calling. Connection restored. -May I come in? -You need something? I guess I should cook something for my son. -Lunch will be in an hour. Good enough? -Yeah, great. -And I'll cook dinner. -You'll have to. -You're not in the Grand. -I know. And may I use your kitchen here? You think I'm gonna heat the whole house? Yes you may use this one. Do you have any vegetables? I'll help you. I mean fresh vegetables. Or at least some potatoes. A vegetarian. You can go out to pick some lichen. It grows all around. Lichen? Well, great. One less thing to worry about. The lichen is a source of the vitamin A and iodine. And it also contains the lichen acid which aids digestion. And is good for appetite. But careful, it's easy to overdose. Yes, one can cook without meat. For instance when you mix buckwheat with some marjoram and garlic you can make great hamburgers out of it. And you add a sweetish dip with shallots and you get a tasty food full of vitamins and most of all, it's fresh. Really tasty. Freshly cooked. I'll get the mama's boy. It died again. -You have to blow properly. -But I have asthma. You wanna see? Wait. Don't overdo it. Stop it. Are you pretending or is it for real? -Pretty good, huh? -You're stupid. Let's go down. Ocko made lunch. Ocko? There's someone else here? That's daddy in Slovakian, you Praguer. We are most certainly not going to eat this. -Nickie's gonna go hungry? -I'll give him healthy food. What's he done? Yuck. Eat it, Nickie. It's full of vitamins. -What's that? -A game. You wanna try it? Why should I? I don't have a computer anyway. Say what? We don't have a wi-fi but we can fly high, says Ocko. We have only a transmitter and a cross in the snow. What? -This is our phone booth. -This. Yeah. I see. It works. Jane, come here. Come and have a look how beautiful it is out there. Wow. And this? Joseph? Joe, wait a second. Can't you see the disaster that's about to happen? I can only see great powder snow. Nick will enjoy nice skiing. Helena needs protection. Oh, come on, you have a need to protect someone all the time. Helena is a grown up. -You really don't see it? -No! Let's go packing. Pull and toss up. Jeez, you're such a gawk. Oh, my. Go! I'm going. Go! I'm going. -Go! -I'm going. Not bad for a rookie. -Really? -Really. Let's go for dinner. Hickie. No! -Give it to me! -You're greedy, really. -What's he doing? -He's trying hard. With him it probably won't be too bad, she's a different case. Mom! Did you see how I jumped? You're good. I'm hungry. I'm working on it. -Stop it. Time to sleep. -Why are they here? Because I promised the pastor. They're totally gonna ruin our holiday. Every Christmas it is just the two of us. This is exactly why we should do good deeds. Because it's Christmas. I don't want any intruders here. Me neither. But it's just for a few days. After that the sissies will leave and everything'll be as it was before. Well, OK. You're my most favorite dad. And you're my one and only Pipi. Well, good night. Sleep tight. Out of order. We'll have a bath. Great. There's no draught. I'll make it work tomorrow and we'll have a hot bath. You naughty little elf. So at least do your teeth. We're brushing. Open up, we're brushing. So, to a very merry Christmas. -I'm Mike. 35 years old. -Helena. -Hello. -Hello. -Well... -Hello. -Hello. Mountain rescue service, a rescuer of all kinds. I am at your feet. What? You don't like it in the hamlet? Oh, you mean the bunker? It's not bad... But the landlord is a grumpy old fart. My bro is the best person in the world. Well, yeah, he's a bit of a hermit but otherwise he's great. Our parents died kind of early and he brought me up more or less by himself and after school he moved over here and he stayed. Alone. So I moved here to be close. Can't you talk to him? That little girl can't eat that canned food all the time. -Mom! -I know, -everybody should live their own way. -Grandpa says that. -Enough that you terrorize me. -I am doing it for your own good. Nickie! I don't like that expression on her face. Let's get out of here. Your hat, your scarf. -We should've set out early today. -But I had to finish the reviews. Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Professor emeritus. Schizophrenia and depression do not celebrate Christmas. Jane. Do we really have to go? -Yes. -Sister-in-law? -Sure you won't change your mind? -No. -She doesn't want to. -No? -No. Shouldn't you call Helena first? -I'm going. -A bunch of transmitters and no signal. Antennas all over the place... -Do you need help? I know a better spot. -That would be nice of you, Suzy. -What do I get out of it? -I can teach you how to braid your hair. No thanks. The spot is right here. Thanks a lot. -Let's go. -Really. A signal. -Ella. Finally. -I don't have good news. -What? -Your parents set off to see you. -It should be a surprise visit. -No! Not that! But you didn't hear it from me. -How is it over there? -Oh, it's all right. Nickie is all excited. But what about my parents? It says here that we should get to the Grand Hotel in six hours. -Is it possible? -Probably longer these days. How about a coffee? There's a gas station. No. Why not? -We're on a trip. -We haven't got very far yet. -Don't you wanna pee? -No. -You women need to pee all the time. -You don't? Men go when there is a call for. Women go all the time. -Stop it. -Give me a kiss. Don't worry. I'll hold us back. Dad. Here's your coffee. We won't call Helena about this. We will surprise her. Jane, this is not a surprise. It's an ambush. Do you think this would make anyone happy? Well, stubbornness is hard to diagnose. So what can I do? Don't irritate, admire and don't fight. No cappuccino for you? Jane, why can't you leave it as it is? Can't they be alone at Christmas, if Helena wanted it this way? Ok. Wait. This is no good. -What? -Bad. It doesn't start. That's it for the trip. You're not serious. -Here you go. -Thanks. -So? -Hush, careful. Watch out, she's here. -Good evening. -Good evening. Suzy probably doesn't wash. She does. -She's a clean girl. -I am. -She baths once a week. -Well I guess I'm a bit of a cleaner girl. I would like to bath daily. But there is just no hot water here. I wouldn't ask for your assistance. If I was able to switch on the dinosaur of a boiler of yours. But I would assist you quite gladly. Besides wanting a wellness here, her ladyship seems to need some groceries. Her ladyship would like to cook but there is nothing to cook from. But there is. Just watch. Bacon for energy and lubrication of the guts. -Onion... -Vitamin C. Bread. Cereals? But primarily the essential vitamin B! I see you did your homework. No more smoked meat. I'll cook from now on. Should we be scared? Yes, you should. Because you are what you eat. That's why you look like a leek. Better than a pig in a blanket. If you don't wanna set an example I'll teach Suzy to eat healthily. In that case I'll make a man out of Nick. -But my cooking won't kill Suzy. -Flying won't kill Nick either. He might get a stomach ache at the worst. Just like Suzy from your cooking. All right. Now you're even. Helena, would you like me to get some shopping for you? I would love that. Here is the shopping list. Wow, you have the list ready. No bacon I guess? Add some biscuits for Suzy. -And some vitamin B. -A lot of vitamin B. We'll need it. Eight sticks of celery? Celery provides the most basic nourishment. Excellent for potency. True! Joey, we have to pack the poles into the ski bag otherwise they won't take us on the train. What train? What are you talking about? We can't give up. We're leaving tomorrow. What happened? Joey! -My back. My back. -No! Let me see. Don't touch me, please. And definitely don't try to fix me. I'm sorry. You know what? You'll take your pills, I'll rub something in... All right, all right give me the skis. May I come in? That vegetarian fried cheese we had on the ski slope was really great. -So we'll have another one tomorrow. -All right. So what happened next? -What do you mean? -You didn't finish your story. Oh, that. You have to go on because it's a matter of life and death. If you don't save the last one then that's it. He'll freeze to death. Maybe you have only minutes left. You have to use the rescuer's instincts inside you. Close your eyes imagine what you'd do and suddenly you know exactly where to go and you find him alive! But I am dead and I have to go now, otherwise they may have to raise an alarm for me, right? I'll make you work! Damn it! What? No fire? Beautiful old boiler but it doesn't work. You'll have your hot water in an hour. Ready or not, here I come, Helena! May I come in? I'm not looking, not looking... not looking at all. -Oh, you put a swimming suit on? -Yeah. This is like wellness, the door can't be locked and I was right to do this anyway. But it's great. Just look at it this way. If you close one eye these could serve as swimming trunks. Well, forget it. May I assist you here for a while? I brought this nice handmade gift for you. All right but only till the snowman lasts. My snowman endures a lot. I have to admit that you stay true to your style. You go straight to the point. I have to be fast, you know. I've a ski-pass for the whole season, you just for a week. I wouldn't expect a bathroom like this here. -It had to be from big love. -Yeah it was. Helena, I wanna snorkel with you. You're such a... The snowman's time ran out. You've drowned my snowman? I'm sorry. You know, I... Good night, uncle. Good night, Suzy. Get lost. Now! Good night, Mike. Night... -You just won't give it up, will you? -What is it, bro? You don't care about her. So I am looking after her instead. Listen, I have no idea what you expect from life with this permanently pissed off look on your face? I'm sorry. I know what I'm gonna be, Mom. I thought you had it all thought through. An archeologist like Lara. -I've changed my mind. -That's good. Lara does a lot of dangerous things. So what is it gonna be? Mountain rescue service. Just like Mike. I'll also be saving people. Nickie. First you've got to protect yourself. But it is great here anyway, right Mom? Nickie! Jacket! They are crazy! This is great! Turn to the valley! We're the kings of the mountains! -We're the kings of the mountains! -Nickie! -You're crazy! He has asthma! -That's why he has to toughen himself. -I want to toughen myself! -That's right! -But this way he'll get pneumonia! -Wanna toughen yourself? -Yes! Morning hygiene! And we are washing ourselves. Morning hygiene. This is how you do it! Did you take that pill? Sure. But it didn't help much. I will have to prescribe something stronger for myself. Would you get it for me? Helena. Good thing we returned. I forgot to pack our gloves. And for tomorrow night I have booked a sleeping car. I didn't want to tell you but I got a terrible stomachache. All of the Christmas sweets? It's probably from Helena's healthy junk. OK, OK. Don't worry. I'll give you something you like and you'll get well again, right? Dad. I hope you're not coming. I'm doing all I can. I'll figure something out. No, keep on walking. We don't need anything. We're not buying anything. Go away. I thought that you weren't gonna make it... and then I'll have to go. -Good day Mr. Miller. -Good day, doc. -I'm glad you're home. -What are you doing here? I got released today so here I am. -What do you mean, Mr. Miller? -Well, it's Christmas. -I don't have anywhere to go. -It's Christmas. And Mr. Miller has no place to go. Well, come in at least for a cup of tea. Otherwise you'll freeze to death. Lunch will be in half an hour. Could you hand me that soup bowl, please? But Jane, you know I can hardly move. Not that one! Oh, great. Now we'll have somewhere to eat. Let's turn it this way. No, this way is better. You wanna put Christmas decorations here? I'd like to. Considering it's Christmas it's quite gloomy here. Dad hates it. He can put up with a few twigs. And now I'll teach you one tasty dish. Tasty? I wouldn't be so sure of that. Step away. Yeah, good. I just remembered that we can use this. If you want wood chips, you have to chop from the top. -Wow, that's cool. -My turn now. You are quite skillful. Jesus! Hold it properly and stop making faces. Swing the axe with both hands. Take the log in your hand. Left hand. Jeez! Don't hold it like that. You are doing well. Swing the axe... now! Watch out for people behind you. Good, right? Once again! You see. What a day. I did all this. -Right, Richard? -Yeah. Mum says that repetition is the mother of all learning. Also, practice makes perfect and practice leads to mastery. I'm a master, too. Look, Dad what I have cooked today. Wow Mom, it looks like at home. I'm sitting here. Mike won't eat with us? He was looking forward to it. Uncle Mike is very busy right now. There is a girls' skiing team downtown so he'll probably stay there. Thanks a lot. This is hummus. Well, that's what they call it. Well, it does look a bit gross. -Richard. -Helena. -Hello. -Hello. -And no lichen today? -Lichen is here. Bon appetit. -Eikcin. -What? Well, it's Nickie backwards. -Pipi. -Pipi? Mom called me that when I was a baby. Christmas. Table, all right. Cooking, all right. But no Christmas celebrations here! I told you. Everything is OK here. How are you doing over there? Me? -Bacon and chia seeds in the mountains. -Bacon and chia? Sounds like something I should put on January's menu. -Yeah, sure. -So don't get too greasy over there. I'm doing my best. We're still in Prague. Let's hope I won't be in Prague soon, too. -Hi, beauty. -Hi. -Got some more organic treasure for you. -I think she won't need it anymore. -Hey, what's going on? -He's a Dementor. Dementor. That's quite accurate. But don't worry. We are gonna party tonight. Stop it, Miller. -What? -You want to keep him here? Of course. Well, I won't let him in my bedroom. Me neither. All right. So you let him freeze to death or what? Let's try this one. OK. It's in Slovak. I'll give it a try. The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. Oh, beauty! Sheepskin seat for your comfort madam. -I'm not really dressed for a scooter. -But you are beautiful. -Thank you. -Ready? -Ready. -Great. Hold on tight. And let's go. -Where are you gonna go in this weather? Are you crazy? -We'll be OK. Bye! Jane, I love you, I like you. But sometimes you piss me off. Move over, Miller. Move over, Miller. Life is a hospital where each patient is longing for a different bed. -Good evening. -Hi, Mike. Hi. -Good evening. -Good, come in. -Hi, David. -Hi, Mike. Good evening. Get to your bed. Good night. Hi. Great! I still wanna dance... and this is a slow song. Mike? Mike, Richard, the hamlet. Idiot. -Hi. -Hi. -Where's Mike? -He was here just now. -Where is he now? -He disappeared. Mike? Mike! Stupid womanizer! -Fucking idiot. -You're jealous. -You know how stupid you are? -Oh man, you're an idiot. -You're an idiot. -You hit me. I didn't hit you. You slipped, man. Stupid Bozo. Hello! Hello sun! Hello sun! We are the kings of the mountains! We are the kings of the mountains! What are you screaming for? What? You should've been out here first. Little bro. And now let's make angels. Hop! Now! -Not angels but the seals. -Yes! And now, Dad, you think something out. Let's have a race! -Lets see who is a better skier! -Yeah! Race! Race! Race! Let's start! Three, two, one, go! I'll give you a head start. Let's go! Look, bro! Look! Girls, do you have a boyfriend? -Hi Andy, give me two shots. -Hi. -You racing? -No, we just went for a walk. -I'd say you have won. -See anyone else in here? No, you're alone so far. Here he goes. You snake. Come. Cheers to the losers. Can't stare at the chicks if you want to win. Cheers! One more time? Ready, steady, go! What is this? Since when do we share baths with our guests? Do I take a bath here with Helena? -It was just a diving competition. -Oh, a competition. Ok then. -Who's gonna hold the breath longer. -Sure. Ready? Three, two, one! So who won? What do you get when you bury 10 vegans? A mass grave or compost. And do you know the difference between a good looking female rock climber and an ugly one? The good-looking one would reach climax while she's still in the base camp. You are an idiot... Pastor making such jokes... I'll show you out, let's go. -Are we gonna have a goodbye drink? -We have to. It is a tradition. The goodbye drink is a must! It is an absolute necessity. You can't. Helena! Will you come down to see the mass? Great idea! We can all go together. -I will try to catch up with you. -That will be a challenge. -Cheers. -What happened? -And we're screwed. -It is normal here. Yeah, it'll be like this till the morning. -Let's play something. -In the dark? I got Mom! -We got you. -I got Mike. -Over there. -What is he doing here? -Come. -I found you! -We found you! -Could you still play anything proper? Play, play, play! Wow. Let's go to sleep. Everybody. Everybody go to sleep. -Good night. -Good night. Shit. My lip. Damn it. Dad? Mom took all these photos, didn't she? What's going on? Tell me about her. All right. Once upon a time in a small cabin on the highest hill, almost touching the sky lived a beautiful, brave and a very funny mummy. Every night she watched the stars and in the morning alone in a snowstorm, she would go down into the valley and then back up again. and she could light a fire with a single match. Not like Helena, right? She's totally different. Well yes. Pipi. Dad? Yes! We're the kings of the mountains! This is amazing! I did it! It's fabulous! Nickie! Nickie! You're totally crazy! You gamble with someone's life and don't care. Mummy! It was the most beautiful experience of my life! You could've killed him. We're leaving. But I don't wanna go home! My dad is not gambling with anyone's life. My dad is not killing anyone. Let's go, Nickie. Finally they are gonna leave. That doesn't go there. It is a task for an archeologist. Do you have an archeologist friend? You mean because I am ancient? I haven't thought of that. I'm sorry. So what do you know about it? Why did Helena go to the mountains for Christmas? -The moron sent her a text. -Don't call him moron. -He's a father of our grandson. -Announced he'll show up for Christmas. She thinks we're going to spend our Christmas dinner with that moron? Yeah. We're not talking about you. -What? -Jane! It doesn't hurt anymore. The pills finally started working. So I'm going to check the car and look at that starter. Don't be mad at me. Or Richard. I really wanted it. So. Wow. So. Jesus. -Are we going? -Yeah. -Actually I am not going today. -Why? I have a homework I wanna do. -But you were looking forward to it. -Well, maybe I'll go tomorrow. At least I can help Helena with wood, since they are staying. And I was looking forward to it so much. Well, whatever. We'll go alone. Where have you been? Damn! And we'll ski strictly by the rules. No fooling around. -Sure. Like this morning. -Well, rather not. Put the goggles on. No, not on your head! On your helmet. Jeez, you're such a dummy. Head up. Oh my God, this can't be happening. -Three, two, one, go! -I'm going! You are doing well. I'm going! -Great. -I'm going! Well, great. Two more years and I let you go on the slope. Get up! In the afternoon you will overtake Suzy. -Flex your knees. Flex your knees. -Your arms. -And your knees! -Ski. Ski! But ladies. We're going downhill skiing. We need the downhill skis. -Yeah, that's it. A crouch position. -This way he is gonna kill himself. A crouch position. You have to bend your knees. First put the weight on your knees and then to the crouch position. And he's gone. Wood. So. It's freezing cold. Save the birdseeds for Prague. Snack for real men, bacon. Helena? Yeah? Uncle Mike called. He's got the healthy groceries shopping for you. I didn't order it. Well, I did tell him to get something fresh if there was a chance. But his scooter broke down so could you take a backpack and pick it up at his place? -And you know which way to go? -Sure, I'll show you. All right, I'll just finish dressing up. Yes! -Go straight home. -I'll take the skis. No, go, your mom's gonna go crazy, run! Mom! I had a great skiing day today! Dinner! Organic dinner! -Where's your mom? -I thought she was here. She's not upstairs. -Suzy, go to check the bathroom, please. -Hickie should go. It's his mom. OK. You're not gonna help me today? She isn't anywhere. Suzy, hasn't she gone to make a phone call? -Suzy, hasn't she gone to make a call? -I don't know I'm not watching her. She's a guest and as such can do what she wants. And we don't have to take care of her. That's what you always tell the guests. -But Suzy, they are different guests. -That's the thing. Helena! Helena! Helena! Where is she? Mummy! You're jealous, right? She could have gone to see Mike. Suzy! Look at the weather. Talk! -Aren't you gonna be angry with me? -No, but spill the beans. I just wanted to scare her a little. I'll go with you. You're staying here. Is that clear? I can see you. Go home. Look after him. This way. I don't know which way. Shoot. Mike! Mike! I'm here! I am here! Mike, I'm here! -Helena? What are you doing here? -Mike. I'm looking for you. -Bro? Hi. -Hi. -Richard. -Are you playing hide and seek? -Right. -And your base is up there? -Come. -Richard, you came for me. You're a hero. Mummy, Mummy, Mummy! Suzy, open the door. It's me. Why are you sad? My mom got lost. Not yours. Helena? Would you like a hot bath? And the boiler is on or should I make some chippings first? Yeah, everything's ready. Don't cry anymore and don't be sad. I'm not crying. Why, your mom is so nice. -My dad is angry with me. -Why? -It wasn't your fault. -Yes it was. Don't say anything to Suzy. -It's just between us. I'll talk to her. -Thank you. You're... a good guy. Guys don't say things to each other either. I was the one who sent your mom to the storm. She could've died out there. In a storm? People don't die in a storm, do they? Well, in the mountains you never know. That's how my mummy died. Your mummy died? When I was a baby. They went for a Christmas climb. And since then my daddy hates Christmas. We don't talk about it. You shouldn't either. My dad didn't die but it's the same as if he did. How come? You said he was on a secret mission. Well, I know he's not on any mission but that's how my mom explains it to me. You know, women. -But I'm a woman, too. -Well, you're right. -Careful, it's hot. -Thanks. -So. To life. -To life. -Is there enough rum? -Yeah, just about. -Thanks for saving me. -Oh, come on. You got out of it by yourself. A city girl in a fog. Helena, where are you going? You'll freeze. -This is not about me but about Nicholas. -He will come on Christmas Eve. -But who? -Nicky's father. I'm sorry. What a bummer. What should I do now? You're angry with me, aren't you? No, Suzan, not at all. This doesn't concern you. Just don't worry about it. You women are past my comprehension. I have... I still have this sense of duty that Nickie should be with his dad. -Yeah, I guess. -There's nothing else in it. On Christmas Eve a family should be together. Yeah, family. On the other hand it's a day like any other day. I don't celebrate it so don't celebrate it either and the problem is solved. You are serious? You don't celebrate even Christmas Eve? -Not even because of Suzy? -No. You're worse than I thought. An insensitive egoist. No wonder you live alone. Yeah. I like it here. I like everything here. I don't even mind baby Jesus not making it all the way up here. Baby Jesus won't come here for sure when they don't celebrate Christmas here. -They can't celebrate it. -Because Richard is hard-headed. That's not true. Their mummy died. -What? -On Christmas Eve. They went climbing. To one of these peaks. Richard didn't want her to go. There was a bad forecast. But the whole gang went. That was when Suzy was very little. Since that day Richard hates Christmas. I'm such a stupid insensitive bimbo. I would just kick my own arse. You couldn't have known that Mummy. And I wasn't allowed to tell you. Richard? I know you can hear me. Or at least I hope you can. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I knew nothing. I didn't know what happened to you. I'm so sorry. I'm so stupid. Thank you. It has been beautiful here. We have had a wonderful time with you. You're a great man. Take your hat off and put the helmet on. So here you are. Catch. Nickie. And this time tomorrow you'll be home. Listen, last advice. Men do cry. Got it? Right? Have a pleasant journey and come again. Wait! Here. I have copied that game for you in case your dad got you a PC. -I have nothing for you. -Not true. Now I know how to make chippings, how to ski jump and more. -Bye, Suzy. -Bye. Helena, do you want to wait a bit longer? No. If he doesn't want to say goodbye... -Hm, all right. -So. So hop on. -You stay home, Suzy. Is that clear? -Yeah. -Bye. -Bye. Bye! No more waving. We're going. -Bye! -Bye! How was your vacation? I can't have you blown away. You look great. -Well, Father. You're a miracle worker. -That was the last one this year. You all right? -I'm alright. -Be careful. It's ok. I'm holding you. I have a question. Vegan or a carnivore? Ready for the big surprise? A carnivore it is.
