Law enforcement. Shut up. Damn... No laptops or telephones. Where are your phones? All right... Marc, we have to get out of here. Bring the cars, we are coming. I don't speak Arabic, jerk. CLOSE ENEMIES Go ahead, do your best. Yes well done. Keep covering. Ivan, stay with him. You lost him ... Wait, wait. Come on, kick. With your right leg. Yes, back last night. Same as last time? Tomorrow, same place, same time? Now with the left. Ciao. Yes? We are there, quietly. Outside the prison. What is it? Come on, kick. With your left foot. Go ahead. Come on, hup. You are not allowed to play here. Me, Manu and the kid. A competition. There is a sports field ... - He wants my ball. Wait, he's looking for a fight with a cop. Manu, cut it down. I have to leave. Better luck next time. Thanks for the hospitality. Did you want to take his ball? What a bummer. Why are you harassing them? Who was that? - Sarkisian. He buys 30 kilos. Hey, how are you, buddy? Cool, and with you? What's up? What a lucky guy, Nouri. Imrane, look at this beauty. He comes out. It's time. Nouri. Saved from the bearded monkeys. He looks good. Are you alright, amigo? Hello all... How nice to see you. What a handsome guy. Are you all right? Good to see you, man. Nouri, bro. Hey, this is not a funeral. He has arrived. Are you all right, fat boy? I hear things are going well. Did you return from Portugal yesterday? - Yes. I may know customers. First some food. - Party at Raji. Get in the car, let's go. We meet at Uncle Raji's. Ivan, come here. Get him here. I have to go back to Conakry. Why? To transport yourself to Tangier to arrange. My cousin Rédouane has already increased its rates. That bastard is getting more and more inhaled. We were too hasty. - No, you were that. Okay, but not anymore. We take over. That transport to Conakry costs way too much. 4000 euros per kilo of coke. Is someone less greedy? I do not know. He has to bribe everyone there. That is how it works, but it costs too much. Do you know what is best? By sea. Straight from Guinea to Portugal. We would save two backs. 2000 euros per kilo. It is riskier. Not necessarily. You said the opposite. I didn't know they would sew us. Drop me off at this exit. I have to do something. I will visit you before the party, okay? Go ahead, repeat after me. Habibi ... No. Habibi hamdoulilah ... Yes that is it. Wait a minute, Ivan. Give this to mom. All right. Call me. Au ... You're too late. Sorry. Coat off. - What have you seen? We did something else. We played soccer. True? Different places. We saw a friend. We did everything. You saw Imrane. - Was it fun? Yes. I recorded 50 messages. - I know. And? Cut it. See you soon. And? - They are going to buy. When? Three journeys have already been made. No idea. You put me in the shit, Imrane. That's not how I help you with your trade. I swear it can't get any faster. It is difficult. They are waiting. There are more dealers. Decrease your price. - They don't trust that. I have almost nothing left. If they don't buy, we have to hold you. We cover you to roll up the Reyes corridor. They will definitely buy. Call them back. Then I go off. They call me back. I hope so for you, mate. Klerelijer. All right, guys? Salaam ... What's up? It smells nice here. Are you all right, princess? - Hey. In shape? - Yep. Would you like some tea? - No thanks. All right, man? - Top. Give me a kiss. Damn it, no kisses? Don't curse where the little one is. Yacin. - I'm working. Working? Yes. - Give me a kiss. I bet you watch videos. Not. - Of course. What are you watching? I do homework. A kiss. - Are you unwell? Give me a kiss. And clean up this mess. I don't get a kiss either. No respect... That is over. Ciao. Grow even more and I'll grow your face. Stop growing. You seem tense. 60 kilos of coke and no phone call from Reyes. We do find other buyers. Relax. I would be happy if it is sold. Damn... We have to visit Ikken. Do you want dope, hashish? Answer. You jerk... Hey. There are suppers downstairs. This is how you attract the police. I already told them. - Let them rot. The coke is in the hiding place. Take the lidocaine. Omar is cutting it tonight. Do we deliver tomorrow? First give Ikken a hand. Those noses are coming out of my throat. Let's go. Nouri, don't you miss the jail too much? Mohammed says: "Yet I had written on my plate: "My wife is sick, my daughter has been admitted, my baby has no milk. " I didn't pick anything up. The metro is worthless. " "Nonsense," says Ahmed. "Look what I am collected in two days. " And he opens a big bag full of 10 euro notes. Mohammed is stunned. "Damn... "Those Gauls are nice to you. "I was unreasonable. "I thought they hated us." Mohammed asks: "What did you write on your plate?" "Simple. I wrote that to me 10 euro shortage for a one-way ticket to Morocco. " Here, 10 euros. Do you want me away? No never. Here. See, all thieves. France says it gives but it takes things away. With Algeria on it, they had given 100 euros. Hey? Okay, see you tomorrow. What is it? - Nothing. Who was it - Curro Reyes. For the 60? - Yes man. I told you so. What kind of phone call was that? Hey? With curro. Is your cousin coming this weekend? Shall i introduce you? Sounds like fun. As agreed? Deal. - Tomorrow at four? Okay, see you tomorrow. Curro Reyes. He drives out of the garage. A last cigarette ... Did he see us? That is impossible from the street. We're going to hold it. Don't you sleep? It's getting late. I've saved food for you. Thank you. I hoped to be home in the old days. Did you have a nice day? Go to sleep, sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Good night, Dad. Yes? - Did you think you were on vacation? Damn it, I'm coming. Hey? Is life beautiful? Same place as last time. In 15 to 20 minutes. Omar ... For cutting. Cool, mate. - I'll call you again. Fouad drops you off. When they are gone. - Deal. How much do you pack? - 20. That's okay. We start with Carminatti. Yes? Coast safe. - All right. Coast safe. Just go. And tell me, who did you rock with? No one. Thomas Müller or ... - Nothing happened. They were crying when you left. She looked like Thomas Müller. You jerk... I can't take you anywhere. It is a wild club. What time is Sarkisian? - Tonight. And Reyes? At four o'clock. Curro calls for the location. Where do we meet Carminatti? The usual place. Relax. Drive away. Damn... Seriously, Manu, call before you come. Manuel ... What do you have? Stop it. Come here. What's up with daddy? - It is nothing. Dad ... Dad is a little sad. But that is about. Don't open for anyone for a day or two. Not for strangers. What happened, Manuel? It'll be fine. Don't let anyone in. Are you okay? Yes. Yes? - Driss Boustani? Join the discussion. Rémi Rufo, Crime Brigade. Bye, inspector. - Hey. I'm calling about Imrane Mogalia. Didn't you know him at Narcotics? Who are you? - Rémi Rufo. Crime Brigade. Fernandez Group. What's up with Imrane Mogalia? He just got shot. Bad news? Yes. Is it he? Yes. And do you know him? No. Do you know who did it? No. It looks like a contract murder. Are you in a business? in which he is involved? Does his wife already know? No. I tell her. All right. I'm telling Fernandez. The engine was cold. They have not driven far. Driss? You here? That is a long time ago. Yes, a long time ago. No... please no. Please no. Not that, please. Did the police shoot him? Not the police. Answer. - Not the police. What should I say to the children? Well? Answer. You go crazy. Piss off. Mom? We were worried. You can go upstairs. Let's go. What is that? Was it the Reyes corridor? I hope not. Talked Imrane Mogalia his mouth over? That's not for him. Nobody here knows about it. What now? - No idea. We'll see with draining if they understand us. I can find out. If they were, then we must cover ourselves. Two dead on a protected deal, explain that. The Crime Brigade may come to us. We see what they have. Keep me informed. What is going on? - Nothing. As if nothing happened. They keep themselves dead. Release your weapon. Release. What are you doing? - Put it down. Put it down, damn it. Walk. Walk on. Turn around. Have you lost us? Don't knock your neck out, you idiot. Was it you or not? Then why are you here? - And you? Why are you here? Stay there. Backwards. Answer. Let me go. What are you doing here? I heard the shots. An hour later I left. I saw Imrane and Sergio dead. Spill Death. There was police everywhere. I didn't know what to do. Or where I had to go. I came to shelter here. I slept here. What happened? Two guests who were waiting for us. Who? - We'll see about that later. What do we do now? Take all that to the cité. It becomes too link here. Look at me. Look at me. Was Imrane Mogalia your tipster? Yes. A long time already? For this deal. Do you know this course? It is not a corridor. Then what? Guests of the cité no longer gangs. But they do work together. They do odd jobs. They go for the money. Hold-ups, cannabis, coke. They adapt to the market. They understand our world. Okay, but do you know these guys? Most of them are. This Nouri, is that his cousin? We are looking for him via his mobile. Nouri deals hashish for Raji. But coke is another matter. Do you know who killed him? The competition, I think. Who is the competition? Many people. And the Reyes corridor? How so? Imrane Mogalia called one of their garages. Those are gipsies, big fish. Tomorrow we will interview Curro Reyes. More questions? No. Not yet, but they will probably come. Who knows the hiding place? Imrane, Sergio ... You me. No more. We just moved. And Omar? No. He only came that one night. No cell, didn't know where he was ... It is not him. I let him go. Did you argue with anyone? Imrane beat two guests in Portugal in each other. But those were losers. And they couldn't know of delivery. Then Imrane, Sergio, you and I left. Then I would have lubricated it. We have to track that guy to whom we delivered, Carminatti. Curro Reyes' interrogation has been canceled. The Crime Brigade suspends the investigation. I know. Thanks. These were in his home. Do you want them? Yes thank you. Were you friends? We grew up in the same neighborhood. That doesn't make you friends yet. They told me to stop. That surprises me. What do you want to know? What did you do with Imrane? Suprised that I come from that area? That's why she wanted me with Narcotics. Thank you for the pictures. Boss, can I have another coffee, please. I'm surprised you can deal with childhood friends. If it goes wrong, you block everything. I'll be right back. Wait. Rémi. Wait. You say I'm corrupt and cover me up? I am not corrupt. Why are you telling me that? Because I need you. What do you mean? Let me participate in your research. Yes, I'm at the bar. I see you soon. Why don't you ask Fernandez? We don't lie. I want to know who you suspect and interrogate. Why? - To roll up the Reyes corridor. And for Imrane. Is that Reyes case set up by you? That's how it works. You arrive after the crime. We are there to commit it and must get your hands dirty. Why would I do it? You need me to resolve the matter. I know their network and I know exactly how they work. You are not stupid. If I help you you are team leader in 2 years. And you get all the honor. Imrane was a good guest. Yes, he worked for us. I swear I want to know who the perpetrator is. If he is dead because of me, I take responsibility. And, Carminatti? I think he's hiding himself. He was not in his club. We have to find him. What is it? Everyone talks about you. You would have killed Imrane to keep the money and the dope. Fuck ... - He was shot from nearby. That raises questions. They also talk about me. They point to us. They are blaming us. Find Carminatti. I'm going to Imrane's family. You are lame. Manuel. - What are you doing here? I know your shortcut. Flicker anyway. Release. - I don't talk to the police. Who shot? - What do you care? You need me. I heard the rumors. I have to find out who it was. You said we didn't grow old. Are you happy? You were right. Now go for it. Imrane worked with me. Yes of course. What nonsense. I know when he was in Conakry, how much he bought, and even where he stayed. The Intercontinental Hotel. I know where you slept in Portugal. Shall i continue? Imrane was not a decanter. You followed us and tapped our phones. Customs arrested him last year with the Amsterdam deal. He begged for help. - Bullshit. What are you thinking then? You sell your mother to save yourself. Imrane, you. Are you gonna read me the lesson, jerk? No, I have a deal for you. - Forget it. Imrane had coke for the Reyes corridor. What happened? - Don't count on me. Which Reyes corridor? As if you don't know that. You are dead without me. You're dead when you come back. What a mischief you did behind that couch. Do you remember? "Whoever makes the bank dirty gets a pack, because that thing was dying. " Was something special going on? No. Not really? Yes. Have a drink, Uncle Raji? Yes please, boy. Were you with him? Yes. What happened? - Guests on a scooter. They shot Imrane, Sergio. I just got away. Do you know who it was? I didn't see them. No idea? - No. They took 20 kilos of coke with them. Do you know something? No. Did you hear the rumors? It's my job to hear the rumors. I do not know who killed Imrane. Or who makes me black. The truth always comes to light. Raji, what do you think about it? People start talking or brag. Imrane will be avenged. Sooner or later. He's my blood. My family. Find out who's behind it. Or the rumors don't stop. I already planned that. Don't worry son, no worries. And he? The old man with Nouri? The Raji about whom I told. Dealer old style. Is quiet, not mobile. Always under the radar. He's the boss. He gives advice, mediates in family conflicts. And the others? Cousins, neighbors. I don't know everyone. They come for the family. Yacin. Yacine, where is your mother? Do you know where your mother is? No. Are you keeping up? Yes... The children don't understand. He was a good father. I know. Yacine is so angry ... I don't know what to say, how i can talk to him. He meant everything to him. He gave me this. In case that. Take it. Do Raji and the others help too? Yes. They help, but ... It's like I'm trapped. They constantly watch how I react. They judge me. Imrane never did that. I knew what you were doing I didn't care. He took care of us. He did what he could do best. We had it right. What a mess. Have you seen Driss? He told me the news. - Therefor? Why do you ask that? I do not know. I'm trying to understand. Nobody trusts me. I trust you. I will avenge him, I swear. Do you want to die too? - Do not say that. Do you want that? - Do not say that. I will return. And do you know him? His name is Manuel Marco. Also comes from the cité. He was friends with Imrane. He worked for Raji. Why do you ask that? His fingerprints in the car and a criminal record. Violence, robbery, years ago. Fingerprints don't mean that he was there that morning. What should he do there? He says hello. Do you think this thing is discreet? Even more to him? No, but we want to interrogate him. He doesn't show himself here. Those guests there want to be seen. Does he have family? No father and his mother is I believe dead. Where is he? I'll ask around. You better go. Flicker up, asshole. Go away. - Dirty bastard. Stop. Stop. Stop. Thanks. Are you OK? Yes. I saw the video. Which video? - Julie showed him. Cécile Marciano, head of Narcotics brigade ... Everyone has seen it. 325 pounds of cannabis with a market value of 2.3 million euros. That's a lot of drugs, isn't it? After 7 months of research has the Narcotics brigade ... Are you proud? Yes, 325 kilos is a nice catch. It's a nice job. And are you proud? - Really. I have to talk to you. May I come in? Gently. My daughter is sleeping. How do you know where I live? What do you know about the shooters? Are there image recordings or prints? Only your fingerprints. Driss ... I have to find them. They also want to redirect me. Tell me what you expect from me. I have to find them. You are replacing Imrane. Continue the deal with Reyes. I cover the delivery. I'm waiting to be stopped, nobody suspects you. And I pass on your information. And I plead you for the coke. And when Reyes redirected Imrane because he was an informant? Then they don't buy anything and you are in the shit. Pray it wasn't them. Good. I'll do the deal. But I love the money. And you give me the names from the shooters. I call you, then you have my number. Call the Reyes corridor. Nobody saw you? - No, that's okay. You wanted to talk to me? Why did you tell me? that Imrane was dead? I didn't want a stranger that would do. The police asked me questions about you, about us. Why does everyone talk about you? Did something play between you and him? I need to know, Driss. And what about Manuel? What's wrong with him? They say weird things about him. He could not be trusted. Who says that? Everyone and nobody. I don't know who started it. Manuel loves you like a brother. After your departure he wanted hear no evil word about you. He thought you were coming back. Please help him. Promise me. Okay, I promise. Hopefully you didn't mess around. Someone's leaving. It's Carminatti. Come on, get him. Forward. Go there. Stop. Help. Let me go. Keep your bastard shut. Who informed you? Who was it Look at me, dirty dog. Look at me. Who told you about the delivery? Say it. Do not you want to talk? Don't you have anything to say? Manu, wait. Dirty bastard. Beware. Oh, kolere. Damn... Come with me. - Wait. His cell phone ... Take it. Fast. Imrane called here. 2 days ago at 7:32 a.m. At 7:33 he called someone. You see? He warned someone. The person calling you is ... Who is it? No idea. What now? Stay calm. I'll keep you informed. What is it? Track this number for me. Did you call Reyes? - Track this number and I'll call. Is there any news? A certain Carminatti was murdered last night. He was in contact with Imrane. Do you know him? Carminatti? Who was he A customer? A supplier? A customer. The entire network is diverted. Any news from Manuel Marco? How so? We think he's the network turns off. Someone who looked like him was seen at the scene of the murder. A reliable witness? No, the man can't confirm with certainty. I think everyone is wrong. And? - It's a mess. You are wanted by everyone. Not Narcotics but the Crime Brigade coming lift you off your bed tomorrow morning. Then I'm gone. You must be there. Find an alibi for the death of Imrane and Carminatti. What the hell are you doing? And that stain on your hood, throw that hoodie away. They have little against you. They know you were friends with Imrane, worked with him. They have a video when you came from Portugal. And no proof for Carminatti. It will be better than expected. If you are not at home, that means that you are a fugitive. I'm not going. Then I can't help you. You are wanted for two murders. Plus cocaine trade. Law enforcement. Law enforcement. Show your hands. Turn around. Calm down, I am unarmed. Don't resist. I'm unarmed. Are there any weapons here? - No. Take it from it. Do you know why we are here? - No. You have been arrested in connection with the murder of Imrane Mogalia. Can I get dressed? And after Portugal? I came back to Paris. Only? Was there someone in your house? No alibi. If I killed him, I would have one. Don't have an alibi won't help you. I looked up my ex, my son's mother. What is her name? Her name is Manon. Manon Quercia. Oh yeah? What an alibi. Did you eat together? - Yes. What did you eat? I forgot that. We fed our child. And he stayed. You broke up, right? That's right. And he stayed? - Yes. He is lucky. Does that happen often? No. He's been busy for an hour. She doesn't break. You know what punishment is on perjury? I'm telling the truth. Are you sure about that? Think deeply. You can still change your mind. Manuel lied a lot in his life. I can know that. But now he is not lying. I was with him that night. The whole night, until noon the next day. Yes? Take the tunnel and you will see me. You were right, they let me go. What a mess. Did you find that number? Yes. A prepaid, purchased with cash in Pigalle, under a false identity and false address. He is still active. He is signaled in Bagnolet, at the Romainville – Juin crossing. She is a wonderful woman. Manon, right? Imrane was a tell-tale or did you trap him? Tell me the truth. Look at me. I took care of it that he was caught. Then I offered help. Why? Why? - What did you think? Before that I work at Narcotica. Its my job. Release. Release. Let me go. You are a dirty rat. A dirty, dirty rat. Hi, Mom. - Hey. You shouldn't have come. He is home. Let me in. Hi, Dad. - What are you doing here? It's for my job. You only cause us problems. Let me in. What do you want? It hasn't changed here. I wanted to see you. You have that now. You can go back to Paris. Paris? You don't even know where I live. We pasted this together, do you remember? I always thought it was ugly. Terrible to watch. Now I miss it. I'm coming to see you on Sunday. It does not matter. We're going to look in that bar. Stand still. Shut up. What is this? What is your door? That one over there. Is somebody home? - No. Open it. Go ahead, open up. Stand up. Get up, jerk. Look at me. Do you recognize me? - No, I don't know you. Imrane, heard of it? Think hard, then answer. Imrane, heard of it? Okay, the coke is sold. But there is cash in the freezer. Grab it. - Calm down. Shut up. Listen. Did Carminatti warn you? - What? Carminatti. Who are you? What's your name? - Jean – Marc Furlan. Jean – Marc Furlan? Did you approach Carminatti? to betray us? Yes. - Oh yeah? Did you threaten him? Did you threaten him, you bastard? I paid him. - How come? Someone said I coke 20 pounds could pick up two guests. If I made them cold, it was for me. I did it. Who is that someone? What is his name? - I do not know. Say it. His name or I'll blow your head off. If I do that, I'm dead. If you don't say so too. His name? I'm taking you to him. For the last time, his name? All right. Nouri. His name is Nouri. What did you say? Nouri. He works for Raji. Don't tell a bullshit. - It was him, really. I know him from the box. It was Nouri. I can take you to him. Furlan, look at me. Why do you lie? Why are you lying to us? - If you lie, your family will die. No. Bastard. - Finish it. Bastard. Finish it. I do not lie. No no... No, come with me. We lubricate it. I have to do it? - We lubricate it. Do you hear me? We go. - What are you doing? I'll explain. Let's go. He killed Imrane. Why did you let him live? I do not get it. He is going to sink us. To who? Raji? Then he has been there. I'm gonna link him to Raji, not the other way around. Are you going to Raji? I have to gain time. Damn. Damn it, we've been there. Dead, spilled. It's like hell. Get out. What? Get out. Get the cash. It is not your problem. It is between me and Raji. If you disappear now, you'll be fine. Grease it. Don't tell anyone we saw Furlan, no one. Just go. Can I come in? It was Raji. Raji had Imrane cold. My son's godfather. He loved Imrane. Why is he doing something like that? I see it happen every day. Brothers or friends who mole each other due to drug or money matters. It never makes sense. Do you know something? Worked Imrane's cousin, Rédouane, with you? Yes. He was found in Tangier, with a bullet in the neck. The Moroccan customs informed me. They were surprised because he worked for Raji. Became the coke landed via Morocco? Yes. - Together with Raji's hash? We didn't want to know. We outsourced that. May be, but Raji must have known. He has good connections. He has protection for hashish, not for coke. I think he flipped. Without protection collapses its entire trade. I think he did as if he knew nothing. He punished Rédouane and you. He pleaded guilty. Imrane wanted to go too fast. And I didn't see anything coming. Because of me he went too fast. I pressured him. What are you going to do now? Just like everyone else I'm going to save my head. Why did you go to Narcotica? Did you miss us? You had to settle bills with us? My face wasn't a problem there, just an advantage. I make Raji pay before Imrane's death. Morocco is going to help us. If you want to leave you make the deal with the Reyes. Or else? Otherwise my colleagues will pick you up. Then I can't help you. It is not for me. It's for you. Nouri will catch you, but never Raji. This is Manuel. Salaam ... I found them. Who is it? Jean – Marc Furlan, tipped by Carminatti, a buyer from us. Carminatti is settled. Not with the other person, but we are going to find him. Thank you, Manuel. We arrange it further. I owe you. - No, it is not. I have to do this for Imrane. It's not up to you. Who attacks you attacks me. But thanks. And if there is anything I'm here for you. I dont need anything. I'm getting out. I finish some things and I smear it. Why? Without Imrane it's nothing. Then come work for me, son. I can use you well. I was sick and tired of this life. I understand that. Do not forget it. Whatever happens, this is your house. All right? Thanks. Curro? With Manuel. Sorry I didn't hear anything, but... Something intervened. - We heard. For me it still goes on. Your cousin made too much of a fuss. - She couldn't help it. And it's settled. I do not know. And if we do 10% off? Or 15%. Or we forget the deal. I will call your location and time. - Fine. Did you know they suspect Raji of the murder of Imrane? Yes. What did you tell the Crime Brigade? What I think. Raji had Imrane killed to protect his trade. So what? Damn it, Driss. Will it get better afterwards? Will Raji's successor be better? No, worse. That is impossible. You lose your self-control, Driss. You are too involved. You wanted me because I'm involved. Don't blame me now. We abandon Reyes. Four people have already died. We don't want to start a war. We arrest Manuel with the coke and that's it. I can not. - It ends badly. Then I am responsible. I protected a friend, you knew nothing. An informant was killed by me, you didn't know anything. Don't ask me to pick up Manuel. And what else? Then I tip him. - If things go wrong, end up in the bin. They are coming. They have arrived. De Reyes? - No, their boys. Park behind them. We will watch the whole deal. They take him. They are approaching you. Follow them. I don't like this. Where are they? They drive into a shed. We withdraw. Get out. Go on foot, we catch them in the act. If we intervene, we have lost the Reyes. Wait here. - Don't go alone. No time. Okay, no tracker. Okay, grab the bags. On your knees. - What are you doing? I shoot you down. - I was tidy. Not according to Raji. Turn around and kneel. What? I'll kill you. What do you mean? Tell me what you mean. Van Raji, for Imrane. Law enforcement. No movement. Dirty rat. Law enforcement. Stand still. Wide-legged. - Stay away from me, jerk. Shut up. Are you all right, Driss? Manuel. Manuel. Stand still, Manuel. And what else? I said stand still. So that's it? Shoot. I'm already a dead man. Sorry. - Are you sorry? Dirty rock meris. You inspire people's trust and you cheat them. Let me help. - Don't you see that I am lost? Raji, Reyes, everybody wants me dead. We take care of Raji. Get arrested and Reyes still trusts you. You get five years and you are two. Once free don't you owe anyone. I'm talking to the judge. I say you took over Imrane's shit. Why would you? Why would you? I'm sorry, Manuel. Sorry. Okay, give me time to hide my money and to warn Manon. You need time. All right. They come to get you tomorrow at 6 a.m. Just go. Are you OK? Yes it goes. I couldn't catch up with him anymore. Do we have their phones? Great, we get them. Rémi, with Driss. You have to do something for me. Go to Manuels ex's house. Will I stop her? - You do nothing. Call me when he leaves. Do you know what time it is? Ivan wakes up. Can I come in? No. Thanks for being with the police. Really. I come to say that I am not ... That I can't see Ivan for a while. Where are you going? Please let me in. I just want to warn you. Tell him I miss him. Stop. Stop it. Cut it off, Manuel. What do you care? Stop. You are so dumb. I know. Stop. I can not do it. I can't do it anymore. I love you. Arrest team? They are ready. Arrest in 5 minutes. Hey? - Did you see H im? I saw him enter but don't leave. He cheated on us. Look at his home and call me. Orange voicemail ... Driss, what are you doing? Law enforcement. Orange voicemail ... Damn. Manuel. No movement. I didn't blame you and Imrane either. I wanted to protect our family. And I broke it. I know you're gonna kill me. - style. I understand. But you are my son. Always. I love you, Manuel. I love you. Let go, Manuel. Release.
