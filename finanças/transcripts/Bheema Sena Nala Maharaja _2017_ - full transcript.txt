[woman] One of the world's best writers of all time Leo Tolstoy says All great stories were born in one of these two situations. Firstly, when a man travels to an unknown or a new place, secondly, when a complete stranger goes to a place The place where I am now is replete with stories. The people who are on their last legs of life come to this place. And this is the last stop in their life's journey I think you know the place I'm talking about. [laughter] The people you are looking at belong to the first kind [bell tolling] These people need the blessings of the God they believe in, along with some warmth and a little hospitality and a few nice words. It will help them forget all their pain and smile Maryamma. Are you still unwell? Come on, open your mouth. -Now, the second kind... -[loud knocking] It's really a challenge to look after them. Open the door! Despite being around people they remain strangers to them They always feel deserted because their own family abandoned them. Uncle, please open the door. Therefore, wherever they go, they remain strangers to everyone. I don't want anyone's advice. I won't listen to anyone! My son had to move to the US. I was a burden to him, so he dumped me here. He wants to see me now. Never thought of me once in these four years. Everyone in here, has a tragic story to tell. I witness their ordeal and suffering everyday. And to serve them without getting affected by all this... It's the biggest challenge ever. Somehow, their problems become my own and I get disturbed a lot. Eventually, you got a headache, Sarah? Mother, can I ask you something? Why is there so much bitterness in relationships? Is it that difficult to forgive for Varadharajan? Which Varadharajan? Our Varadharajan, Mother. The one who says, "May I help you..." Is that Varadharajan or Sundarajan? Try to recall. It's Sundarajan. Yes. Why did I say Varadharajan? Where? All of a sudden? It's not all of a sudden, we have been planning on giving you a break. I don't need any break, Mother? I'm quite happy here. Sister? Whose decision is it? Yours or Mother's? Mother's, but... Where am I going with all these packed bags, Sister? Who do you think you are? Son of a bitch! Hang up! Mother, where am I going? We're going to have Davanagere benne dose after Chitradurga and head towards Honna... Mother, please tell me. Sarah, life is a long journey. Every journey has a story of its own. And in this journey of yours, a new story awaits you. And to tell us all your story, you have to go now. You must go, dear. -Hello. Hello, sir...-Have you left? Yes, I've picked her up. -Ask for her name. -Yes, sir. What's your name, madam? -Sarah Mary. -Sarah... Sarah-Maari! Not Sarah-Maari, Sarah Mary. That's her name. Give the phone to her. Madam, here. Go ahead, madam. Welcome to Nadi Moola Resort, madam. I say this to everyone who comes here. You're destined to visit us. Travel safe. Piping hot biriyani is awaiting you. Oh, really? I love biriyani. Nadi Moola resort is the best resort in this entire area, ma'am. You will start feeling better the moment you step inside. Come, madam. Ma'am, this is your room. Damn it. Ma'am, please hold this. I don't know what's wrong? The bulb? Or the wiring? It's a great resort. Just a tiny problem with the bulb. Ma'am, you freshen up. I'll get you something to eat. Okay. Madam, come on in. Special room service exclusively for you. Piping hot biryani, Nadi Moola resort's special. Superb! The chef is a great cook. I would like to meet the chef and thank him in person. No problem. You can see him right away. In the meantime, I'll fix the bulb. Really? Where can I find him? You will find a docked boat with a curtain that's where you will find the man who cooked this delicious biryani. Hello? Hello? Did you cook the biriyani? It was delicious. Hello... Mister! I'm talking to you. The taste is familiar. In fact, it gives a sense of belonging in an unknown place like this. Anyway, thanks. Don't say thanks, ma'am. It frightens me. What? Are you serious? Does it really frighten you? Yes. Several years ago, a girl visited this place and tasted my cooking. And then she said "thanks." That moment changed my life forever. Oh, I see. But, how? Can thanks mean so much to someone? It's surprising. How is it possible? It's a long story, madam. I'm going to tell a stranger's story to another stranger. This is very interesting. Tell me the story, please? Madam... Please! Please, please, please. -Tell me. -Okay, come. If you want to hear this story, then you'll have to watch this dream first. My child. Come here, dear. Come. Come here, dear. Wake up, dear. I've been waiting for you. I'm cooking for you, sweetheart. Come, my child. Come. Come, my child. I'm coming! No matter how delicious the food is in the dream, the flavours stay behind in the dream. When you wake up, it's all gone. Only kids like him can dream of food. By the way, do you know which place this is? Yes. Badavarabandu Anathashrama. Hey, wake up! Mallesha, Rudresha, Gowreesha, Nandeesha... Hey, Jagdeesha... The boy who ate well in his dreams last night... that is me. Spare one bucket of hot water... [all reciting song] In the lotus with one petal As a child, I didn't know any place other than this orphanage. [singing] The person over here... Not him, he's geometry. Pan the camera up. He is the one. He is everything to me. My only family. Appayya, a father figure to us. I always had three meals a day and slept well back then. But... Sir, why do you prepare the same food every day? I'm not your mom to cook varieties of food and serve you every day. Do you expect me to feed you like your mom? Get lost! On one side, there was this unlucky boy, who never tasted the food prepared by his mother with love. On the other side of this round Earth, not very far from here, she had mother's food hour after hour. Freshly churned butter. The sweet sizzling sound of the mouth-watering dosa, chunks of butter melting on the hot dosa, with the aromatic chutney powder on it. [slurps] Every morsel feels like... a step closer to heaven. Who is this virtuous soul concealed within the warmth of her mother's love? [singing lullaby] Who is this little one sleeping peacefully to the tunes of her mother's lullaby? My name is Vedavalli Varadharajan. Yes, she is Vedavalli, aka "Dummi Valli." The daughter of Bombe Iyengar bakery's owner. This is Bombe Iyengar, aka Varadharajan Iyengar. An expert at baking cakes. Though he sells confectioneries for a living, he is a bitter person. -Don't put anything over here...-His day doesn't go by without a fight. I said leave! Be it the neighbouring biriyani shop Pappanna, or his own daughter, Veda. He's rude to everyone. -[in Tamil] Hey, what have you done? You've ruined everything. [in Tamil] Get lost. [Saraswathi singing] You must be wondering why I'm narrating this story to you? Everything prepared at Bombe Iyengar bakery is quite famous and incredibly tasty. He who extracts honey would lick a little off his hands. Similarly, Valli has to taste everything that is prepared at the bakery. Nobody can stop her from doing that. I'll complain to your father. Valli does not care for threats at all. But... her shenanigans, her father's anger... Veda! and the punishments... when things went out of control, their lives started to go downhill. [crying] Disciplining is a part of child's upbringing, agreed. But when the punishment crosses all limits, a father won't remain a father anymore, he turns into a monster. He becomes Hitler. [indistinct chatter] [Veda wailing] What impact would such punishments must have had on that poor soul? -Think about it. -What are you looking at? Get some water. Look, how she's sweating. Hey! Look... don't... You're interfering when I'm trying to teach her a lesson. [sobbing] [in Tamil] I understand everything. This is how we were growing up in our respective homes. Our relationship was like the mountain gooseberry, and sea salt. This was our relationship. To pickle the gooseberries and the salt together spice is necessary, right? He is that spice. Kenda, aka Kendaganna. Hey! I'm an orphan by birth, but Kenda is by circumstances. Where there is ember, there needs to be a spark, and that spark has to be ignited. [boys clamouring] And the fire was lit. Leave... I will hit you! Hey! Do you know at what moment this fight took place? Guilty of whacking Kenda's face... [chuckles] Latthesha made a roti for him. Perhaps, that was moment a cook in Latthesha was born. You shouldn't fight with anyone. You should make rotis for me every day? Okay. How is the roti? Tastes like feet. Bad company turned the monk vile, Kenda's influence on Latthesha turned him... -Want something? -Like you have money! It's not money that you need... When we were blissfully indulging in our shenanigans, little did I know... the most important person in my life will be somewhere there. It was the auspicious day of Krishna Janmashtami. At the temple of Lord Krishna the preserver of the world. We, the participants of this Cosmic drama, were ready with our costumes... And God lifted the curtains. When it was time for Latthesha and Valli's life to take a drastic turn Latthesha was destined to do what he did. -Do you really want it? -Mmm. By stealing the butter meant for someone else Latthesha became indebted forever. And Kenda was the perfect partner in crime. -Come on, Kenda. Time to go -I'm coming. Wait for me. But little did we know that, this act of mischief would bring about such a drastic change in her life. [indistinct chatter] [in Tamil] No, Dad, it's not me. Dad, honestly, I didn't do it! [in Tamil] What's wrong? [crying] Mom, I didn't do it. -Please, Dad! -Shh. [screaming and talking indistinctly] [Veda crying] Swerve it! Swerve it faster! [both screaming] -Listen, stop it. -Swerve it faster! [in Tamil]Be quiet! -Dad, please! -How dare you lie? Mom, I'm scared. [both screaming] [crying] [straining] Then what happened? Then... [chuckles] BHEEMASENA NALAMAHARAJA We met after 15 long years. And in those 15 years, a lot had changed in Latthesha's life. Each grain of rice has two names written on it one belongs to the diner and the other, the chef's Sir, are you the cook? I love cooking, sir. I want to be a cook, sir. Will you teach me? Sir... There is great joy in learning but you will be in trouble if you forget the recipe There is great joy in learning Can't I stay here if I want to learn how to cook, Appayya? How long would This relationship stretch up to? -Be happy. -Whoo! It was a treat for the eyes and palate... Hey, buddy, just come with me. The world is a big place. It was a treat for the eyes and palate... Bro, where did you find this swamp? He is an all-rounder He can cook North, South, Chinese, sir. And he has 12 years of experience as a cook. Here's the kitchen, bro. There's no one to tell you how to cook now. It's up to you. Every story has Scores of characters Irrespective of their roles They all must perform. One minute... I understood your story. Who is that girl? How did she look? There is life, if you live well... That's her. Else just a bag of misery Please, continue. Now I can follow the story. How many pillars to support... Please, tell. This hanging bridge? As many as one recalls... -Hey, walk slowly! -Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello, aunty. Hello, Anand. [smacks lips] It's Aravind. Aravind. You had coffee, right? Though it sounds like a cliche, will you sing a song as per our tradition? -Oh, come on. I can't. -Hey! You can try. [in Tamil] Sing a song. Oh, Lord Krishna, please come Oh, Lord Krishna, please come Come seek refuge at your devotee's house Oh, Lord Krishna... [coughing] [in Tamil] Here. Krishna, what is this? "A boon to tickling throats, Ananda cough Syrup." Come please us With your alluring appearance No match to you in this vast world Sorry, mom. -Oh, mother... -Hey, Valli, what are you doing? Look, Anand, I wanted to tell you this at work itself. But you are too dumb to understand it. That's why I invited you home to give you a live demo. Because... in this house... Father and daughter don't see eye to eye. -You know why? -Why? Can anyone accept a murderer as their father? Is it possible? [singing] The snake's spite lasts for 12 years, my rage goes on for 1000 years, you rogue. -Bombe Iyengar, come here! -Shh. If she stays here, there'll be a war. Take her to your home. I can't take her home, my dad will be furious. -[line ringing] -Hello? Sir, are there any rooms available in your resort? Sir, is there a room available in your resort? Sir, do you have a room? Oh, there is? One has to pay back the debt, right, ma'am? That brought us together after 15 years. Valli-Latthesha, the second part to the drama had begun. [gasping] [crying] The graceful laughter suddenly turned into grievance, It couldn't understand why. [crying] Mom, please come here. Where did this part of the story take place? In the woods beside the river. And in the moor amidst woods. That moor was called Nadi Moola Resort. Pass me the water. -Here it is. -You have to be agile. You should at least pretend that you're scared. You're a spoilsport. What did you say your name was? Latthesha. -What? -My name's Latthesha. She's quite weird. One moment she was very cheerful. [screams] and the next, she hid her pain under the mask of happiness. She had the rage to turn whoever came before her to ashes. We were four boys living in this moor. And she was the only girl amongst us. She can definitely do it. Look at her face, she looks really scared. -She will do it. -No, she's scared... She was fickle minded. Her behaviour was extremely unpredictable. Are you out of your mind! What if I drown to death? Why did you bet in the first place? Hold on to the rope properly! [indistinct screaming] Ma'am, you have to pay 100 bucks if you lose. You bastards, I'm going to beat you up. Hell with your bets. -Having fun? -[laughing] [shrieks] [screaming] Like this wasn't enough, we heard strange stories about her. Her mother drowned when she was a kid. She is scared of water and boats. Please. Calm and composed in the day. Rage and fury comes out in the night. It all felt like a bad dream. Here, have this hot kotte kadubu. What's your story, ma'am? Mine? There's no story. There's no story? Impossible. I've none! I don't remember anything! I don't want this! Ma'am... She had come here with a huge baggage. Hold on. -Just a minute. -Tell me. Are you narrating this story to me or... Veda. Or to Veda? Latthesha is narrating Veda's story to Sarah. When did you come here? I was here all along. Food is great, so is the story! -Please continue. -Yes. Continue. Come on. Milk is on the stove. Look after it. Breakfast is ready. -Serve it. -Okay. [indistinct chattering] Because of you I'm going to get earful from both our parents. I can't take it anymore. Let's go! Ma'am, let her stay back today. It's okay. Latthesha's wish is my command. I'll stay. Give it back -Have this, ma'am. You'll feel better. -Okay. Hello. She isn't a simple girl at all. Don't read too much into her smile, okay? I use my hand to measure ingredients while I'm cooking, ma'am. My eyes can see the true nature of a person. You don't have to squeeze in there. Get in the back. That's okay, madam. Please sit comfortably, madam. I'm fine. What the problem, bro? This is what happens when three people occupy two seats. Latthesh, where are we going? Surprise! Madam, this is my world! -What? -Yes, come. Come on, ma'am. Let's go. -I'm not going anywhere. -Jai Bajrangbali! [people clamouring] How much does it cost? -That's 150! -What? 150 for this? What? How much is this? How much for this? This one? That's 100. -What, 100? -Yes. Stop fooling me, okay? I'll pay 50 for it. You already owe me 10 bucks. Pay up. -What, ten bucks? -Pay me first. Here, take this. -Give me that. -That one? -I won't. -Why? Fish isn't cheap, go to the stream and fish all you want. Fine! I'll buy a bigger one than this. Sure, go ahead. Come, ma'am. What did you come here for? Get out of here if you aren't buying anything. Leave now. [groaning] You came here to buy fish or to pick a petty fight with that lady? Let's go! -To where? -The stream. -[groans] -Come. [indistinct chatter] Success! Mr. Latthesh. What kind of a home do you like? -Me? -Yeah. -These hills and rocks... -Yeah. the place where it rains all the time, I don't like them at all. It stopped raining and the sun is out. We are here for more than two hours now. Have you ever caught a fish before? Is this your first time! Yes, madam. [groans] My limbs hurt. Okay, so... Tell me what kind of a home do you prefer? Hold this, I'll tell you. There should always be people around my house. People should be in queue to use the toilet when I open the door in the morning. The vegetable and fruit vendor, the flower seller should be right outside the house. I want to see rangolis, and sight of children's bum being washed. Washing bums? Yeah, ma'am. That's part of life. Something's pulling, Latthesha. Don't let it slip. It's our lucky day. Please don't distract me, ma'am. We got a big catch. This fish really saved my face... [laughs] Well done! -Mr. Latthesh? -Yes, ma'am. If you go to a new place with a peculiar name like Latthesha, all those little bums out there, will ruin your name by calling you Latthesha, Latha, won't they? You're right, ma'am. It never crossed my mind. What can be your new name? If I ever change my name, I'll change it to Bheemasena Nalamaharaja. It's good. Bheemasena... [groans] There's no need. Latthesha is good enough. He likes that name. Let him change it to Bheemasena Nalamaharaja. No way. His name's Latthesha. Bheemasena Nalamaharaja. -Latthesha! -Bheemasena Nalamaharaja. -Latthesha! -Bheemasena... Shut up! If you keep fighting like this, I'll give myself a nasty name. -No, she... -[shushing] -Hey, tell her to sit down. -Ma'am, ma'am! 'Bheemasena Nalamaharaja! Oh-ho! [indistinctly screaming] Bheemasena, the king of chefs All Hail the honour of the Kuru dynasty, Bheemasena Bheemasena, the king of chefs What's wrong with you? Stop overreacting. By screaming on the streets you can't change his name, can you? There's no need to change his name to Bheemasena Nalamaharaja. For me, he already is. -Don't you trust me? Come, I'll show you. - Let go of my hand. Hey, that's just a fish. Stop exaggerating. [groans] It's just a fish to us. But he is Bheemasena. Do you know how it appears to him? He who smashed the thigh of the Kuru Prince Who challenged the game of dice He who slayed the pervert Kichaka For harassing and assaulting He who formed a pail of blood From the chest of the one Who dragged Panchali He who declared The battlefield as the kitchen Bheemasena, the king of chefs [groans] I can't watch this. The killing and bloodshed is done. The job of the scientist begins now. -Scientist? -Yes. This salmon fish has to be marinated with some salt. Add a little ginger-garlic paste. Then add a dash of garam masala made of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, pepper and chilies. And finally, fry it in groundnut oil at 300° Celsius. And then your fish fry is ready. [gasping] It's not what you think. The King of the Sun dynasty, The author of Pakadarpana The King of the Sun dynasty, The author of Pakadarpana He blends in the six tastes To create a flavoursome delight He who satisfies the soul and the palate He is Nalamaharaja It is Bheemasena Nalamaharaja It is Bheemasena Nalamaharaja Looks tasty, bro! I'll drench myself in drink today. Ma'am... Ma'am... What about us? I always dreamt of having this fish. I'm not going to share this with anyone. You won't be able to finish the whole fish. I swear by the God in your amulet. I bet 1000 bucks. Oh, yeah? -I won't you let you touch the fish. -Hey, stop running, come back! I will not share. Period. I won't even give you a tiny bit. The whole fish is mine. Thanks, Latthesha. Are you blind? Watch where you're going. Are you blind or what? She's a lost cause. Ma'am, that's all right. They are just playing. Hey, don't you want the fish? Let it go, bro. How come you're doing the laundry? Get out of here. Run. He's gone crazy. Shameless. When will you stop humiliating me? Where is your amulet? It's just an amulet, not gold or silver. I don't know, madam. I'm pleading you... Please! I don't know, madam. -I want my amulet back, please. -Oh, good Lord, why will we take it? -Hey, do you have it? -No, dude, I don't. She went with the fish that way, and ran into Kenda, and then he put the towel over here, and then he smacked us so we got away from there. We really have no clue about it, ma'am. [indistinct chattering] [gasps] Where did you find this? It is not important. We found it, right? I know. Those guys didn't take it. Please don't probe further on this matter. She stayed here for five days, and in those five days I saw laughter, sadness, anger, fights, etc. And it was time for her to leave. [crying] What are you doing here, madam? Everyone's waiting for you. These five days were the best days of my life. Please stop it, madam. You don't understand. Madam... Everyone's waiting... You're sending me away, too? So soon? No, madam... Thank you very much. Where are you going? We're getting late already! What are you up to? What happened, madam? [crying] Had she left without saying anything, this story would've not continued. Now, when I sit down and put together the pieces. The thanks she said, and her hug, both had the power to wreck me. Which is why I told you that thanks changed my life. Dose? -Faster. -Dose. Yes, sir, two minutes. Salt, sour, sweet, bitter, pungent and astringent. All the six tastes are in this. Anyone can cook using these. But you have a special ingredient with you. And that is love. I looked for it everywhere but didn't find it. You have it in you in abundance. Hello? Hi, madam. Yes, madam, just hold on. -Bro? -Who is it? Hello... Hello, ma'am. -Give me the phone.-Tell me, ma'am. You shouldn't call him. Give it back! Don't ruin his life. You shouldn't call him. -Kick me. -Buffalo... -I won't give you the phone. -You owl! You have a special ingredient with you. That is love. Bro, Kenda is calling, he wants you to come right away. Get lost! [mobile ringing] Hello. Hold on, ma'am. Where have you been, Latthesh? I've been trying to reach you from so many days. -Ma'am...-Never mind. I want you to come to Bengaluru today. Now. -Bengaluru? -Yes. I have an awesome surprise for you! Everything is ready. -We are just waiting for you to come. -Hello. You are coming today, okay? -You must. That's all. -Okay, ma'am. It's a wrong number. Wrong number. Are you in love? Nothing like that, bro. Are you going to fall for the hug and this invitation? Well... Even I've kissed you now. Stay here. Have you lost your mind? [snoring] Will you go with me? You can't, can you? Are you going to leave me? She called him up and he's leaving with a bag. If you leave, who will make rotis for me? Stop staring. You're acting like you're possessed. That's why you've gone crazy. I know how to straighten you out and bring you back here. Let's go! Come! You can't differentiate between the right and the wrong. They say do not look for the source of a woman's psyche. But I wasn't ready to listen. To look for that source, I left Nadi Moola. The third part of the drama has begun. BHEEMASENA NALAMAHARAJA Here are the keys. I want you to serve thousands of people. Thousands of people in this city crave for good, tasty food, you know. You have to go to them. And satisfy their hunger. And that's why this truck is called Bheemasena. 'Good food avoids sickness and good talk avoids quarrel' You'll feel cold after a cold shower And you'll feel warm After a hot water bath You'll feel cold after a cold shower And you'll feel warm After a hot water bath Walking on a path with trees gives shade If you walk against the path, It'll cause you pain If you evolve to be a fat crook, You'll be punished If you involve in charity and compassion, You'll be rewarded It is true, it is true It is true, It is true You'll feel cold after a cold shower And you'll feel warm After a hot water bath... I found this place in just six hours. How is it? Hey! Are you an animal to live in a cage like this? There isn't enough space here to live. For broad-minded people, even a small place like this can be a mansion, Latthesh. But for narrow-minded ones... Come with me. I'll show you the specialty of this place. Dance instead of sitting Mesmerize people with the performance Ankles need anklets And the eyes need kohl One must earn, save And become a breadwinner Money should be earned And a good persona must be obtained If you earn and save, you'll be at ease If you run behind Nymphs, Your life will be ruined It is true, it is true It is true... What do you have to eat? Raagi mudde and bassaru. Raagi mudde... Bro, hold on. Try it. Food for your body and soul. You eat raagi mudde Your health will prosper Sing a song with the perfect tune... TODAY'S SPECIAL 'MUDDE GANAPATHI' It'll turn into a beautiful song It'll turn into a beautiful song It'll turn into a beautiful song It'll turn into a beautiful song Kannada, Kannada... He's a versatile cook. No one thinks like him. He has adapted our culture very well. It's a fantastic job. -It's very good. -We want both pizza, burger and this. I told you so, didn't I? It's fantastic, extraordinary. How do you sell this? Based on the number of morsels or plates? Ma'am, can anyone put a price tag on morsels of love? You'll feel cold after a cold shower And you will feel warm After a hot water bath You'll feel cold after a cold shower And you will feel warm After a hot water bath... There is a small bit of selfishness from my side. You tend to find some kind of a belongingness in the food he cooks. So, all those who were deprived of love in their lives would feel less lonely. And get a tint of zeal in their lives. 'Mudde Ganapati' is the symbol of strength and devotion -Mudde Ganapathi... -There is plenty. Please wait. [people clamouring] Finally, he's brought her to the streets. Who are your parents? What's your caste? You don't know your caste, race and you're good-for-nothing but you want to marry her. Hey, come here. Are you better than Anand? -Uncle, it's Aravind... -Hey, shut up! There isn't a better match for her than you. You still want to marry her? Yes! He's the one I'm going to marry. How's that possible, madam? -Ma'am, please... -Don't you want to marry me? I need to time to think, ma'am. See, I know their type. I've seen so many of them. He will not marry her. -He will. -No way! -Today! -Impossible! -Right now! -No... Take it and tie this around her neck! You, idiot! They are putting up an act. One is a monster and the other is a devil. They both are equally bad. Shut up! Or I'll smack your face! I'm telling you for your own good. Let's go from here now. Hey! Don't you like me, Latthesha? Please try to understand me. I feel like you're all I have in this entire world. You're my only friend. My best friend. Isn't this enough for you to marry me? Take it and marry me now! The moment, I saw pain in her eyes I got emotional and married her right away. You tied the knot! Let's see how long this will last. You've my blessings till it does. Let's go. I've dreamt a lot about things in life, but never ever imagined this... Thanks. Never imagined I would marry someone right in the middle of the street. One more thing, ma'am I'd spend my consummation night the way I did. [radio tuning] Sorry. I forced you to marry me, but I don't feel like I'm married. Do you feel the same, too? No, ma'am... Madam? [radio tuning] -I have a desire. -What is it, ma'am? Somehow, I became a family man too. Now I can tell the whole world that I married someone I love. Along with the marriage comes family and responsibilities. Your aspirations grow bigger and you want to move into a bigger house. But... a bigger house doesn't guarantee happiness. To tell you the truth about my family life. We aren't at all happy. But I still continue to dream, you see. I dream of having a big family. And there is no compromise with that. What is it? -Come, bro. -Why? -Stand over there. -Leave me alone. I have a desire. We need to have a family of our own in a true sense. I've come up with an idea. Come and sit over here. Your mom and dad will sit over there. This seat is for you officer. This is Swapna ma'am, the fat lady's seat. Bro, you will sit over here. This will be your seat I want to see you all sit together and have a good meal. How does it sound? We two are the family. No room for any new members. We two are more than enough. The two most important people in my life, Valli and Kenda, but they don't see eye to eye at all. -Hey! What? -I know it's you... I was sick and tired of their never ending fights. And the person who was hurt the most was me. Give it to me! Don't you dare enter my room. -What do you think of yourself? -Hey! What you guys doing? Have you lost your minds? Stop creating a scene! Look, I won't say another word. He has taken my amulet. Tell him to give it back. Did you dream of me stealing it or what? Why should I? There's only one thief in this house, you! Bro, look, she's calling me a thief! You must've misplaced it somewhere. Let's look for it. Please, calm down. Why would I misplace my own amulet? I've looked for it everywhere. He stole it. Tell him to return it. -No, bro. -Bro... Bro, in case if it's with you, -please give it back. -Hey... Stop it! You know how important it is to me. I swear, he has stolen it. -Tell him to give it back. -Bro... Don't believe her. Please don't believe her. She's a filthy, dirty bitch. She's an ogress. She is trying to destroy our friendship. You know its importance, don't you? He stole it for sure. Tell him to return it, please! -See... -Please! [sobbing] Give your bag, bro. Give your bag, bro. Bro! Bro! Hold on. Where are you going? You haven't taken it, right? Stay here. Stay right here. Don't leave. Stay right here, bro. Where was it? Where did you find it? -It wasn't in the bag, right? -It was on the floor. Must've fallen out of the bag. -Bro, wait! -Let him leave for good. He's a rogue! Let him go! By the time I returned, my friend, of 25 years had gone too far. Without my knowledge, I had committed yet another mistake. Going by his story, I think his friend must've done something out of envy. Perhaps, it was his wife who was envious. Am I right, madam? Stop being biased. Don't men make mistakes? But women don't admit their mistakes. Am I right, sir? Look, he's laughing at us for fighting over someone else's story. Bro, tell us what happened next. I made a mistake. But I still don't know whose fault it was. I paid the price, anyway. This is neither a hostel nor are you a warden to just cook timely meals and serve them. I'll eat only if you feed me with love. I'm your wife. Do you remember that? Oh... Are you? Are we really married to each other? I don't know what's going on here. I'm confused. Are we... lovers? Or friends? Am I your husband? Or am I just a cook? I really don't know. I'm done with everything. I can't take it anymore. I want a simple wife, a small family. That's it. Loneliness... A gruesome isolation. And then? Hey! You're not just my best friend... You're my lover! And my husband too! I saw myself in you You mesmerized me through your eyes I've become one with you We've united with each other in harmony A flower is blossoming inside Through the warmth we shared Can I reach you My sole destination Through the mellow tunes of my emotions? I saw myself in you You mesmerized me through your eyes -Latthesha. -Yeah. I have one small desire. Very small. What? Why feel shy? Are you not my companion? Am I not your lover Who fulfils all your desires You're the anchor of my life, my dear... I want you to churn a bowl full of butter for me. Right now. -Now? -Yes. The haunting pains and memories Of the yesteryears I'll sing a song to fade them away I shall become the rhythm To this sweet song [groaning] [screaming] Madam, it's urgent! Labour pains. [Valli straining] Not me. There. In the ambulance. -Nothing to worry. -[straining] You did all this and now asking me not to worry? Get out! What are you staring at? Take me in! You, rascal! Come here. If you don't look after me once the baby is born, I'll kill you! Scoundrel! Rascal! They haven't moved to the ward yet. Where did you buy the saree from? From Chickpet? It's lovely. How much did you pay? [baby crying distantly] Who is here with Vedavalli? Are you deaf? I saw myself in you You mesmerized me through your eyes -Hold tightly or else you'll fall. -Get lost! How many times do I have to tell you to wear a helmet? Get lost. [song playing over gramophone] Latthesha, why is the same song repeating? The needle has gone blunt. Until it's replaced, you'll have to live with that sound. Appayya. Appayya had brought a message with him. Despite knowing his tragic past, you've made him an orphan again. You could've stopped him from leaving. Are you aware of his condition now? This is a gun to burst balloons, they use this in carnivals. Then? I won't tolerate you disrespecting Appayya! Stop! Why are you running away? Where was this old man all these years? From where did he appear all of a sudden? -I know what's going on here. -Don't come closer. Drama. -Shut up. -You just need an alibi bring that rogue home. Don't abuse in front of the child. Yes, I will bring him back. Sure, go ahead, bring him. Bring everyone home. Bring that rogue and also my father who abandoned me. And also that bitch who married my father, my stepmother bring her too. Go. Go! Shall I give you the address? Tell me! What transpired that night triggered other events in my life. Let me tell you the truth. There are two orphans in this house, not one. I was born orphan but you're an orphan too? Did you know that? And you are responsible for that. Try to understand that! I don't want you. I'm scared. Don't come close to me. -[Valli grunting] -Latthesha! Look! Who are you? I'm Lalli. Which Lalli? Go wherever you want to. But she will stay here! Lalli? You'll stay here or come with me? Speak up! Get lost! [grunting] I'm the tiger. I don't want this tiger. There are already two orphans at home. [mobile ringing] I don't want to see another one. I don't need anyone. I can stay alone. [screaming] I will not let my daughter turn into an orphan. [Valli grunting] Is she... She is the person I was telling you about. The person I was waiting to narrate this story to... But do you know what actually happened? It has injured that part of the brain which makes the patient lose their memory completely. [grunting] This is very interesting. What happened next? Can you please tell the story? Dear Mother, I can now comprehend how special this journey is and how interesting it is. Because of a small anger, a small rage, - and a misunderstanding... -Where are you taking my child? I can't begin to imagine what sort of problems it can cause between two lovers, Mother. Because of the fight they had that night their lives were devastated, Mother. [woman screaming] Unhearing the calls... -Someone is here. See! -Do you know whose vehicle this is? Unseeing the seen... Take a good look at it. Come with us. Why this game of forgetfulness? Do you want to see this lover fail? Picture me through closed eyes And as you visualize Open your eyes and see me Picture me through closed eyes... My son. We came out to close the church gate. That's when we heard crashing sound. And then we found her lying on the ground. And as you visualize, Open your eyes and see me You see this, right? In the MRI scan? It was a severe brain injury. We've removed the clot now. Autobiographical amnesia. Posterior. The part of the brain which has injured makes the patient lose their memory completely. Our Father was a great cook too. He used to cook well, you know. He knew he'll be crucifixed the next morning, yet he cooked. That is known as "The Last Supper." I'll tell you a secret, child. Cooking has the power to face any obstacle. Let the light fill up The dark space As the warmth fills in Let a new flavour rise As the sky lightens up To dawn some support And as we step forward There is a need of hope... Valli, wake up! Valli... -Wake up... Wake up, Valli. -Hey, Lalli. Leave me! Let me go! Next time you cook, use two new ingredients. Love and faith. Picture me through closed eyes And as you visualize, Open your eyes and see me Hey, Latthesha! Look there! Look! Veda, control! This game of hide and seek Has left me perplexed This bird has forgotten Its way to its nest Latthesh. It's okay. There is a treatment for everything. In cases like these, each and everything related to the patient, people, situations, I mean, every incident that has occurred in their life. Starting from the most recent ones to the ones in the past, you will have to recreate everything. And as you recreate everything, when the most important event of her life occurs again, she will be able to recall everything. -Really, sir? -Of course. It is possible. But, until then, we've to continue doing our job. You will require a lot of patience. You know why? Brain, which is the size of two clenched fists, is very powerful. Appearance, taste, smell, touch... And similar experiences such as laughter, pain, sorrow, resentment, happiness, all these emotions combined, occupy only 10% of the space in it. But when it comes to the human psyche, nothing is more trickier than it. For example, a lamp and a switch, both are in working condition and there is electricity supply. And yet, when it's switched on, the lamp doesn't light up. The wiring between them is damaged. The entire wiring needs to be checked thoroughly, and should be fixed. And as you continue doing it, the electricity would flow at some point and the lamp will light up. Picture me through closed eyes... Hopefully, it benefits everyone. Go on. And as you visualize Open your eyes and see me Sir, is this a pharmacy? Picture me through closed eyes... He's here, sir. Try coming as soon as possible. Oh, is it? Okay, we'll leave right away. And as you visualize Open your eyes and see me Sir, we have just six days to make everything fall in place. If she doesn't get well, I'll lose all I have. I hope she recalls everything. This is my prayer. Bro, who is this girl? Your wife? She's a cracker. Sir, I suggest you start advertising mirrors from tomorrow. All men will bow before you for saving their money on cosmetics. But keep away from women. Stop blabbering, will you? You got to be careful with women. They aren't trustworthy. They might even ask you to carry the mirror for them. -Hey, Latthesh... Come here, quick. -What happened, sir? She's already there. Something might happen. Bro, what do I do with this mirror? Leave it there. Look, I told you. She has opened the trunk. That means she remembers the number. Shh. Hey, get down. Do you remember what that is? Come. Do you know what it is? Can you try? How old is it? Who owns it? Where was it bought? Well, how about these two? -Do you remember-- -Don't touch anything in the trunk. Don't lock it. Just a minute... This trunk is as complex as her mind, Latthesh. It's secured by a number lock. We have to open this trunk to understand her complexes. Don't you worry. I'll cut it open with a blade. I'll cut your head open. Is that okay? Somehow, we've to open this trunk. Can you open it? It's been at home for seven years, but I've no clue how to. How many secrets can a person's mind hold, Mother? Can a simple number shed light on all her mysteries? What's that number? Come on. Come on. Oh, good Lord! Open! Come on! You're going to break it! That's the only way to open it. Zero to nine, four digit number, and 10,000 combinations. If we keep trying like this, it might take a day or even ten years. But we have only six days on hand. Make way! What is the mystery number? I don't know. But what I really appreciate is, their sincere and whole-hearted effort to bring back Veda's memory. For example, Dr. Francis... [sighs] A very strange person, Mother. In principle, he is Veda's psychiatrist. But in a way, he himself is a patient. He has a peculiar disorder called OCD. I think it comes with being a doctor. He's also Swapna's fiance. So to fulfil his duties and to impress his fiance, he is using all his intellect and giving more than hundred percent. But... Nothing happened for eight months. Will it happen in the next six days? If we continue our efforts, it's a medical probability that her memory would come back. But putting in efforts to make it happen in about six days, hoping for a medical miracle? A wonder! All their happiness depends on a miracle that needs to occur in the next six days. In the hope of this miracle, everyone is waging a war against time and memory. Valli, don't you know me? And me, I'm a guest after all, still, in what way can I be of help to them? If you use these ingredients, she would perhaps recall your cooking. All the best. A personal suggestion to you, if you don't mind. Tell me, ma'am. I think your love is hidden behind your facial hair that's why she's unable to spot it. Until she gets back her memory, I can't break the vow. Okay. Salt, sour, sweet, bitter, pungent, and astringent. All the six tastes are in this. Anyone can cook using these. But you have a special ingredient with you. That is love. I looked for it everywhere but couldn't find it. There's love in you in abundance. Don't lose it. Hey! Madam? Valli madam? Try to recall. Look at it, madam. Madam... Have it, madam. What a tragedy, Mother! That fateful moment when Valli asked Latthesha to rename himself as Bheemasena Nalamaharaja... Must have been an inauspicious moment when Latthesha planned to fulfil Veda's wish... [gunshot] Shakuni and Shani, the villains in the lives of Bheema and Nala, both have taken a rebirth in the form of Kenda to trouble them. So you have come here to heal her, is it? Pull her by the hair, slap her, and then ask her. Tell her to stop the farce. [slurs] When everyone was trying their best to bring back Veda's memory... this villain, Kenda... Bro, no! No! Listen to me! ...lit fire to the projection curtain. He's posing a serious threat to derail all the efforts... There are only five days left! Will Veda be able to recall by then? She is fooling you all with her theatrics. Latthesha, will Valli talk? Promise? Are you fading away from me Come to me like a shadow Are you running away from talking to me? Come back as our pail of laughter... It's been so long since we got back from the hospital. And she still hasn't spoken. Why is she not talking? When will she talk again? I'm craving to embrace you But I feel numb... Look at this calendar. As the days pass, your mom will remember everything. When will she recall? When will she talk to us? On your birthday. Promise? Come back as thyself As a mother Are you fading away from me? Come to me like a shadow Valli has a tape record player. -Will you bring it? -Why should I get it? Because it will help your mom regain her memory. What if she hits me? -She won't. -Promise? God... Lalli... Look, Lalli, you want to shop for your birthday or not? Come, let's go. If you don't come, I'll go alone. She'll go without you. Come. Will you go shopping with me? Okay, dear? Let's go? Come. As I wait for the warmth... We bought a new dress! Of your love The need for closed doors Has elapsed Sir... Sir... No need to pierce. Please stop. -It must be paining a lot. -No, it's not paining. [crying] I don't have any pain. Promise Come back as thyself As a mother... You are looking like an angel. Lalli, your birthday dress is very cute. Since I'm wearing my birthday dress, shall we celebrate my birthday today itself? Yes, of course we could... But shouldn't we wait for your mom to get well? What else do you want, dear? How many times have I told you to fix that lamp? -Do it right away! -Why do you require a lamp during the day? It's a bad omen. Fix it right away. I think your head needs a bit of fixing too. Till then nothing else will work properly. -What do you mean? -You are a nutcase... -Shut up. Is that the way to talk to him? I'll fix it tonight. If he has told you to fix it, then do it. Latthesh, come, we've work to do. -Do it now! -You do it. You come with me... Come. Damn, you all. The only sane person in the resort has gone mad today. Hey, will their treatment work? No way! What are they going to do now? I'm least bothered. I don't care. I'm going home tonight. I don't want to do anything with you or them. The doctor and the patient, both are crazy, I'll go mad if I get involved... [hissing] Careful. What? Good girl. What do you want? Here... There are two doctors, you know? Who? Since they're in different kind of clothing, you couldn't figure out he was a doctor. So tell me who it is. You guess, let's see. White and white? Fatty? [indistinct] Then, is it you? I've a tonic with me. If one drinks it... they'll be able to recall everything. This is the one. Damn. It's bone dry. The tonic that'll remind your mom everything... Will you bring it? [thunder rumbling] Who gave this to you? An uncle gave it to me. You won't get this here. Go. Give that bottle to me. Girl... That isn't medicine. Give it to me... Hold on. Give it to me. -Where are you off to? -To the next store. Oh, God, now they employ kids to get alcohol!? [screaming] Lalli? Lalli? Lalli? Lalli! Lalli! Lalli! [shushing] Stay quiet. Why are you following me? Why have you come here? I need to buy a medicine. Medicine? I know where to find it. Come I'll get the medicine for you. Come. Come. Come on. You stay here. I going inside and bringing medicine. No, I want to come. In there? There are doctors with injections inside. Do you want a shot? No. Then sit right here. -I'll go in and get it, okay? -Okay. -Is she awake? -No. -Did she find out? -No, no. I don't want her to panic. Oh, Latthesha... Latthesha... Latthesh, relax. I'm sure she's somewhere around. When did you last see her? I haven't seen her all day. All day? Sir, she's never done this before. Hey, girl, here's the medicine. This will cure everything. -Okay. Go. -What about you? There are a lot of patients inside. I'll come later, once I have treated all the patients. Okay, you go. Alright, you leave. -Okay, bye, uncle. Thank you. -Okay, bye. Good night. Thank you. Happy birthday. -No mention. Bye. -Bye. Latthesha, take this medicine and give it to Valli. Where did you go? Where were you? Like your mother's shenanigans aren't enough, you've also started. Where did you go without my permission! -You lie to me all the time. - About what? You told me this white-and-white will cure Valli, but why didn't you mention about the other doctor? Who? Take it. This is the medicine. -Did you give it, doctor? -No, no, no... Not him. Ah... Him. Until Valli speaks with me, I won't talk to anyone. Hey... Latthesha... Latthesh, what are you doing? Easy, easy... I was humiliated, I was hurt, but I never, ever talked about it. I'm enduring it as a punishment for what I did that night. My daughter has nothing to do with it. Latthesh, stop. You... If you dare mess with her again... I won't hesitate to kill you. I'm done doing your chores. Get somebody else to do it. Stay away from my daughter. I don't care even if my wife doesn't recover but I want you out of here. Thanks for all the help. Don't turn me into a murderer. Latthesh... How insensitive... There's no tinge of remorse in him. And then, there's Lalli. She's too young to understand the situation. But she's still trying to do anything -to bring back Veda's memory. -Lalli... It's quite deep over there! Don't go! Until Valli comes, I'll be in water... Veda, please ask her to come back, she'll listen to you! Lalli, come back! -Your mother is calling you. -Lalli! Lalli! Latthesh, go rescue her or she'll drown. -Lalli! Lalli! -I won't come back till Valli comes here. Leave me! Leave me! Managing them has become a big challenge for Latthesh. Why did you go there? Do you think she cares if you drown? I neither feel pain nor I'm scared! Poor Latthesh, his condition's very miserable. Although Veda is witnessing everything, she is unable to recall a thing. How can a mother forget her own... own daughter? What kind of a sick disorder is this, Mother? With each passing day, the hope of miracle is fading away. I'm apprehensive that this family might break into pieces. [screaming] There is a treatment for everything. In cases like this, everything has to be recreated. It could be a happy situation or even a miserable incident. Her mother drowned when she was a kid. Give me the kid's boat. I want my boat right away! When the most important incident of her life occurs again, she will recall everything. Forward! Forward! Forward! [Valli groans] [Valli straining] One... Two... Here it comes. -Here it comes. Here it comes... -Leave me. Veda! [indistinct] [gasping] [shivering] [footsteps approaching] [screaming] Hitler! Hitler! Hitler! Hitler! Hitler! Hitler! [panting] Hitler. When the most important incident of her life occurs again, she'll recall everything. Are you angry? Are you angry? Oh, you're angry? Are you angry? If you're not angry, give me a kiss? Leave me! Sir, should I go? Should I answer that? Sir, how can I leave her in such a condition? That's not the reason for you to not go. Don't let your ego take control in such situations. Come on now. -Don't wander here and there. -I know. Come to me as a shadow Come back as our pail of laughter Come back as a reason or even as pain... Okay, Sarah, Lalli is your responsibility now. When a person is fighting for his family, we've to wholeheartedly support him. Come back as thyself Come to me as a shadow Come back as our pail of laughter Come back as a reason or even as pain Come back with the same memories Come back for me Come back as a baby Come back as thyself -Is the order ready? -Madam is taking care of it. Sir... You may not value your family. And you may have severed all ties with them. But we need you, sir. Sir. Quality isn't good. -The quality isn't good these days. -Sir... Sir, please come with me. All they want is Chhota Bheem and Spider-Man cakes. What's the name? Theekshith. Deekshith? No, it's Theekshith. Give it to me. -Theekshith. -Yeah. What a name. You care so much for the name on someone else's birthday cake. If only you cared a bit about your daughter's life, we wouldn't have been in such a situation. Spell the name. K-S-H... Listen to me! Please listen. I want my Veda back. I need my family back. For that, she has to undergo the treatment. I don't know if that's what you want. You have to play a part in it. A bitter part. Come. Please. Slowly. You know nothing. Who the hell hired you? Hello. Namaste. There must be a cone there. Somewhere down there... -Which cone... -Good morning. Your daughter is safe with me. Who is he? A new guest? Search properly. Slowly. He's not a guest, Hitler. It's in here. Is he here to tell the story? What kind of a story would Hitler tell? [woman singing over music player] [in Tamil] Saraswathi's song. [song continues] Oh, Lord Krishna, you are welcome here Oh, Lord Krishna, you are welcome here Over there. Mukunda, please come to us, Oh, Lord Krishna Please come to us, oh, Lord Krishna Oh, Lord Krishna Come please to us With your alluring appearance Come please to us With your alluring appearance There is no match for you You are the Lord of the world Yes! I'm not an ordinary hot-headed man. I'm very short-tempered. Veda! Don't interfere when I'm teaching her a lesson. My daughter made small mistakes. But I gave her severe punishment. Keep standing, don't move. -But there is a reason to it too. -[in Tamil] Dad, I won't repeat it. There's no limit to her intake, sir. [coughing] She is still a child... How can you punish her like this for eating? At this young age, you have high BP, diabetes and heart problem. And your daughter is quite plump compared to others of her age. If this continues, she might also get all these diseases at a young age. She could also contract diseases at young age. It would be wise to control from now. [Valli wailing] Valli was too young to understand all this. [Valli crying] Dad! Her mother was ill all the time. Why don't you send her on an exile? Look, in her opinion, I'm Hiranyakashipu and her daughter is Bhakta Prahlada. And I'm giving her all the troubles in this world. At this stage Narasimha has to come out of the pillar to kill me. The doctor has been worrying us. [Valli crying] Mom! Mom! The fear of losing my family made me act in this manner. [reciting shlokas] It was June 1st. It was her birthday. We were at the temple to pray for her wellbeing. [in Tamil] Don't touch. I didn't know how to make her understand. I lost my cool when she didn't mend her ways. So... I decided to teach her an unforgettable lesson... Maybe this time she wasn't wrong. [in Tamil] No, dad, it's not me. Why did you assume that it's always her mistake? Look at this. It was empty. There was butter in it. Who else could it be? It's her. And you thought she was at fault. [in Tamil] Dad, honestly, it isn't me! [shushing] I too think it wasn't her fault. I mean... And then? [in Tamil] How dare you lie to me? Swerve it. Swerve it faster. I'm scared, Dad. I'm scared, Dad. Please. You stay quiet! Though the mishap took place right in front of me, I was completely helpless. I couldn't save my Saraswathi. I don't know how many times I've regretted doing that one mistake. -Veda, dad's right here.-All then I had my daughter with me. It seemed like I made a mistake saving her life. I appeared like a demon to her. Only Kavitha was capable of looking after her. Manja, don't you have a spare tire? Oh, you fool... Kavitha stayed home all day and night to take care of the child, that gave rise to a big gossip. [indistinct chattering] To put an end to these rumours, and to not cause any more trouble to this woman, I married her. That looked like another mistake to my daughter. Veda, please have your food. Hey, where is she? -[in Tamil] Mom, come here. Mom... -Give it to me. I'll feed her. Mom, you come here. -I continued making mistakes. -Mom... Veda didn't listen to me at all. Why are you getting angry? Please talk to the owner. Oh, come on in, Mr. Bombe Iyengar. You've shown up at our restaurant for the first time. Have some tea. We won't charge you. Look at your daughter, she's eating to her heart's content. I wouldn't have sent you the bill. But since you talk about the right, the law, and the truth, -I sent the bill to you.-But... In order to teach me a lesson, to punish me for my mistakes... Do you know what my daughter did? [fire crackling] [breathing heavily] As she grew up, her hatred towards me grew too. I didn't get a chance to talk to her. In these 25 years, I didn't even get a chance. You snatched away her mother and kicked her out of the house What do you mean you didn't get a chance? Latthesh, it means he didn't get a chance to speak with her. It doesn't mean a thing! She grew up like an orphan even though her father was alive. Ask him if he has fulfilled his duties as a father. Ask him! Varadharajan, you ought to answer this. Please answer. Don't hide anything from us. Is this an house or an hotel? To come and go when and how she pleases. Is there any responsibility left? Hey, Ranga, tell her she shouldn't touch anything. These are my mother's memories! What do you want now? You snatched my mother from me. But you can't snatch away her memories from me. I'll break your bones, Ranga. Dad... Dad... No one can take this away from me! I tried with all my will to apologize to her. But she distanced herself from me and the house. -Please wear the helmet, cops are around. -Hey, leave me alone! You are such a specimen. She started to live -in her friends and others' homes. -Wow, what's this? -Hey. -Hey... That is boti fry. Let her eat. She's a hungry mongrel. They will eat anything from anywhere. -You eat.-Despite being shamed and pained in those houses, she believed she did not have anyone. [people clamouring] She will not go anywhere, she will stay right here. You go to the room. She will stay right here... I thought she would be happy if she got married and I tried that too. -But... -Why? Can anyone accept a murderer as their father? Finally, one day, I saw my daughter happy and content on TV. They talk behind her back at the office. But I don't have any problem with that. I'm still ready, you know. -Do you know where she is? -Yes, uncle, I do. Her friend, the fatty, Swapna, tell her to come as well. See you, aunty. Tie this around her neck if you're a man. I thought she would be happy with Latthesh, so I turned vile to get her married to him. Someone cast an evil eye on her happy family. I heard she met with an accident and had lost all her memory. I couldn't gather the courage to talk to you. I don't know, sir... I plead you. Please save her! Come. Two people have to forgive me. One, my daughter, and the other... One who endured all the pain but living with me with a label of wife. She's like my daughter. Please stop it. I have to bake a cake for tomorrow. I called him Hitler. Now he has become a hero in my eyes. Tomorrow is my birthday. Will you bake me a rose cake? Oh, Adi Keshava, you dwell in Udupi I am Kanaka, a humble devotee How do you say "go?" [in Tamil] Podi. How do you say "come?" Vaadi. How do you say "sit?" Vakaarudi. -Oh, so just add "Di" for everything? -Of course. Come-di, go-di, sit-di... Cheddi. Here. Uncle... I will pray specially for you to reunite with your daughter. Oh, Great Lord, what is this divine play! [chuckles] Each and everyone here are such pure souls. But this situation is portraying everyone the exact opposite. Is this the fate everyone talks about? Although everything seemed crystal clear, it wasn't what it appeared to be. If only the players were aware of the game of fate, things would've been a lot better. -Do you really want to have it? -Mmm. What a game, bro. His father who was known to be Hitler, is now a good man. Who is left out? It's me. The biggest villain of her life. She can pretend as much as possible, but she won't be able to suppress her anger on me. And that's why... To try and bring her memories back, I had to play a role in this act. But it was of no use. A lifetime's rage... you smacked me to pulp. Forgive me. Don't. You are a good man. Latthesha! Drink up. You need some tonic too. Valli... forgive me. I just want you to regain your memory. May the darkness dissolve into this night. And may the light pour in some hope too. May this story end with Veda getting new lease of life. This is my prayer. Lalli. Lalli! Come here. Latthesha... Look, the calendar has gone thin. Why is she still not talking? Tell her to talk to me, Latthesha. I'm not telling her anything. You made a promise. Cheater... Cheater... Cheater... Promise... Promise... -You made a promise... -Hey! Don't you have manners! Don't be so stubborn. -Come with me! -Leave me! -Leave me. -Leave her alone. Where are you going? Valli... Valli, come here! -Grandpa... -I'm already repenting for my mistakes, don't make the same mistake. Please. -Latthesh... -Come! -[people clamouring] -This is not part of the treatment. You want a birthday? You and your mom want to celebrate? -I'll teach you a lesson now! -Valli! -Shut up! -What are you doing, Latthesh! Valli! Say now. -I won't. -Sing "Happy birthday." -I won't. -You won't? No! Valli! Valli... Sing "Happy birthday!" -What are you doing? -Hey! Step back! I'll burn you. Go away. Are you out of your mind? She's just a child. Is this some game? Veda, your child is experiencing the pain you went through. [crying] Are you listening? Nobody came to your rescue that's why you are sick today. I'm sorry, Dad. I won't repeat it. Valli... -Sing "Happy birthday." -Stop it! Happy birthday to you... Only you can save your daughter from her father. [in Tamil] Dad, I won't repeat... Valli! Listen to her. Your daughter is screaming for help. Valli! Mom! Mom! Go save her. Valli! If you don't respond now, your daughter will have to go through the same ordeal. Valli... Go! [in Tamil] No, Dad, I won't do it. [crying] [in Tamil] No, Dad. I won't repeat it again. I won't. I'm scared, Dad. Mom... [crying] Come to me, Mom. Mom... [crying] Who are you? Sarah. Not Sarah-Maari, Sarah Mary. Then why did you shout "Father"? I... I am Veda. Can anyone accept a murderer as their father? Will you accept? It's all my fault Ready? It's all my fault I played games with my life Are you Sarah or Veda? This is very interesting. Please, tell me the story? Yes, Sundarajan. That's right. Why did I say Varadharajan? Hello. Doctor, -Veda is talking about Varadharajan. -Oh, okay. Where am I going with packed bags? And when he uttered that word The taste seems quite familiar. In fact, it gives a sense of belonging in an unknown place like this. My life changed forever. How? It was ruined, madam. Shattered into pieces. This body that is the shrine, He is my lord... Latthesha... [breathing heavily] Latthesha... I remember everything. That day... It was raining heavily. -[indistinct argument]-And we had a terrible fight. You took Lalli out. Don't worry about being a poor man... Answer the call. Answer the call, please. There are two orphans in this house, not one. I was a born orphan and you... No! Dad... I'm sorry... He who was with me at all times Is still here [horn blaring] [screaming] [screaming] Posterior. Her that part of the brain is injured, which usually makes the patient lose their memory completely. Be seated here. I'll be right back. Hey, Sundarajan, enough with the decoration. Come. Hey, Sundarajan... Varadharajan! Sundarajan! Sundarajan! He has always been by my side... Sundarajan! To celebrate the victory Of my life's journey Who are you? Sa... Sarah. He came in as my chauffeur... Sarah. Sarah. It's your mother's name, dear. Saraswathi. Sa-Ra... Saraswathi. She met with an accident on her birthday. -That is... -On the 1st. -How many of you were on the boat, sir? -Three of us. Sixth month. And how many of you survived? You're... not Veda. Then... who are you? I'm Dr. Arohi. Dr. Francis' assistant. I plead to you. Please save her. Sir, look... She's making notes. See... See here. She has mentioned about the boat incident. The rest is left to you, Latthesh. He has my back at all times... -Valli! -Sing, "Happy birthday!" Veda, see... See... Please listen. See... Your facial hair is hiding your love that's why she's unable to spot it. He's the lord of my soul, my soul mate... Hold on. Who is that girl? This is her. Please, continue. Now I can follow the story. [crying] Why did I even recall all this? Things would've been better had I forgotten Veda. He won't let go of me He's the lord of my soul, my soul mate He won't let go of me [sobbing] No, Latthesha. No. You have no idea. This Veda is an unpleasant woman. She troubles everybody.
