I always believed that love was fairly uncomplicated. You found the perfect woman. Gorgeous but practical.

Her grandmother's setting up an art school or something and needs help. - No way. The last time you tried to set me up...- - Did I ask you to take her out? No. I just asked you to pick her up from the airport and show her the sights in Salt Lake on the way to her parents house. Then dinner if she's hungry. Sounds like a date to me. - It's not a vacation. She just wants to see the sights. - So send mom. - Her father seems to think you two might hit it off. - Her father? - My new regional manager. - Oh, the plot thickens. - Look, all I want you to do is pick her up, show her the sights, take her home. Simple, easy. - Okay, well then I'll take her to Temple square and buy her a milkshake. - Oh you can do better than that. It's only one night. Please? As a favor to me. Clubsy? Welfare? - Deal. 70 bucks and the Mustang. I was on a roll. One quick lap around town, a light dinner, home by 8:30 and I'm 50 bucks richer.

Come back to New York and we could do this like you wanted to. Why the rush now? I'm here, I might as well see what Salt Lake has to offer. - Come on Charly, quit with the games. Who's playing? - You're a little upset. You play games when you're upset. Just tell your dad you're getting back on the plane... - Dad's not coming to get me. Who is? - I don't know, dad arranged it. Jealous? Of what? Some Mormon guy? How do you know he's Mormon? - You're in Utah. The state that buys more wedding and birth announcements per capita than any other state in the civilized word. Trust me, he's a straight laced button down bore. Last call for flight 160. Hello? Charly are you listening? - Believe me Mark, you have nothing to worry about. Please do not accept any items from strangers. Report all unattended bags to airport police or airline representatives. - That's me. On the sign. - I'm Utah, welcome to Sam. - Nice to meet you Utah. Sam's a beautiful place. I take it you're my ride home? - Sorry, yeah. Sam Roberts. Can I help you with that? - No thanks, got it. You work for my father? - No actually I'm a student like you. - You're an art major? - Computer information... - Perfect. Did my father tell you why he wanted you to pick me up? - Actually I've never met your father. - I'm practically engaged but daddy doesn't like my choice of men so he looks for fine upstanding young men, like yourself, to lure me away. You know what? It's working. Coming Utah? - Excuse me, excuse me. You're engaged? - He's asked but I haven't said yes. Why, are you interested? Don't you think you ought to get that? - Sorry, it's to remind me not to be late. - Okay Utah, let's get this over with shall we? - Look, if you don't wanna go out I'm... - And disappoint daddy? Not a chance. What's the plan? - Why don't you decide. Got all the local historical sites and points of... - Amy, Anna, Barbara, Tessa. Well Utah, is that your little black book? - How about this is the Place Monument? - Not much there? - Hogle Zoo then? - I'm allergic. What do those little check marks mean? - There's Trolley Square, it used to be a Trolley station and now it's a huge shopping mall. - Fascinating. Oh oh oh, yours? My fathers. - Do you have a rating system or is it just survival of the fittest with you? - There's always Kennecott Copper Mine. The largest open strip mine in the world. - Wow, hate to pass that up. A fun filled evening with you at the local strip mine. Somehow Utah, you don't seem the type. - What'd you put in these things? Hey, what are you doing?! Come on Utah! Are you crazy? Slow down, I wanna be able to borrow this car again! - It's for fun Sam! Sounds like you need a life! You cannot drive like this in Manhattan. - You're not supposed to drive like this in Utah Charlene. - Charly, call me Charly. I don't think this is such a good idea Charly! - Relax Utah, if you can drive in New York you can drive anywhere! Of course I can't drive in New York anymore.

He's just proposed and you are the first one we've told. - Actually we've just met. - Congratulations kids. - Why thank you. Sam and I would like to ride your Ferris wheel for a long, long, time. You understand? - I'm not that old. Hang on. - Do you do that often? - What? - Lie to complete strangers? - No. I lie to people I know too. Come on! Loosen up Utah. - Aren't you kinda cold in that? - Why, are you hot? Why couldn't we be engaged? Aren't I good enough for you? - I don't even know you. - Exactly my point. Who's to say I couldn't qualify? You voted for him? - Yeah what's wrong with that? - Nothing if you like a soil grabbing global warming corporate puppet. Yeah, it's nice to know America's safe in the hands of voters like you. Describe her to me. - Careful. Who? - The future Mrs. Utah, what's she like. No, no, no, let me guess. A little on the stout side but pleasant. Always pleasant. Perpetually A print but never ruffled. June Cleaver with a day planner. - You have no idea what you're talking about. - Come on Utah. You can not tell me sitting there in your highly starched shirt that you do not dream of tying the knot with some ultra organized gorgeous woman who just happens to love to cook, and sew, and cater to your every whim. - I don't know what I want yet. Certainly haven't found her. When I do, well, I'll know it, she'll know it, and we won't run around being practically engaged to each other either. We'll get married and we'll stay married. Because frankly, love isn't something you just toss around between the lost and found. - You really mean like til death do you part? - No, more like forever. - Why Utah, you are a romantic. Who would've guessed it? A man who actually believes in happily ever after. I hope you find it. - This one is your fault. - Most everything is. - Who's idea was it to have him pick her up? - Now Clair... - I could've picked her up, you could've picked her up. - I don't think she would've enjoyed that nearly as much. - I suppose you prefer she date the same riffraff she's been bringing home since junior high. Captain non-commitment. - Mark. Well he'd be a whole lot better than some hypertensive boy scout. - Well wait a minute, I think he's kind of cute. Why didn't you tell me he was so handsome Eddie? I imagined him to be someone more humble. You three behave. Sam, I'd like you to meet my family. This is my father and my mother. - Mr. And Mrs. Riley. - Oh, no need to be so formal. Call them Eddie and Clair. They love that kind of thing. And this is my grandmother. - And you can call me anything you want. - I had so much fun the other night that I asked Sam to show me more of the city. He's lived here his whole life. Tell them that fascinating thing you told me on the way home from the airport. - Did you know that there's a difference in humidity between here and New York. - Really. - Fascinating. A difference in humidity? - Right, that's why we feel so uncomfortable now. - I don't feel uncomfortable. - Well that's 'cause we're inside. Well wait til later and you'll feel uncomfortable. - Oh, you mean when I'm alone with you? - That's not what I meant. - What exactly do you mean? - We have to go. - He can be so shy sometimes. Don't wait up. So, now I can say I have seen the Mormon Vatican. - Temple Square, you almost got us kicked out. - There wasn't a sign. - I don't think they anticipated someone would actually go wading in the reflection pool. Can I get you anything else? - I'd like a glass of Merlot please. I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol here. Would you care for something else? - We're fine thanks. - You people are so much fun. - Charlene... - Charly. Charly, why did you ask me out? - Your magnetic personality. I feel irresistibly drawn to you. - Can you be serious? - I'm trying to be. You're one of the oddest women I've ever met. You lie all the time. You have no respect and you're always messing around. I had no idea I had to take you. - Take me where? Truth? You intrigue me. A grown man who still believes in fairy tales. But I wonder, does he really believe it or is he just never read anything else? - Maybe it's not a fairy tale. - Sam! You are not like any prince I have ever read about. And I am no princess. Still you do have a castle. - See, listen,... - And it is beautiful. Who knows. Maybe while I'm here I can learn more about you. The Mormons I mean. - I think I can arrange that. - Is it always like this? - No, this is just a good day. - It's a very good day. I don't believe a word of it. And grandmother's convinced I'm in the clutches of a strange man bent on making me the newest member of your church. And she thinks it's all very romantic. My parents have vowed never to let anyone pick me up from the airport again. What do you do with all this stuff? - We can it. We put it in glass jars and store it. - Doesn't my dad pay your father enough? - You're changing the subject, what about the missionaries? - I told you, I don't believe it. Ooh, what are these? - Green beans, have one. Why don't you believe it? - I told you, the whole thing's ridiculous. Hardest thing to understand is why you believe it. You look like an intelligent person. - Is that right? - Of course, looks can be deceiving. You have raspberries!? - Why don't you find out for yourself. - I thought that's what I've done. - No you have to ask. - Mmm, these would be so good with ice cream. - I mean you have to pray. - To what? - To God. - Hey God are you out there?! - Something like that. - And he'll just pop up and answer me? Me and all the five six billion people on the planet? - He'll answer. Really. - Oh, like hearing voices. - No, you feel it. More than anything else. And you know. - You're kinda cute when you're serious. You get this little furrow thing right there. It's very distinguished. - We could pray right now, right here. It's pretty secluded. - Why Sam you romantic devil you. - You wanna say the prayer? Come on, kneel down. - If these bushes suddenly burst into flames and Charlton Heston appears, you're in big trouble! Do you mind, we're about to talk to God here. - Okay, close your eyes and I'll say it. - Sam, you are definitely crazy. So, what do you think? Technically fine. But? - But why the fruit salad? What's so compelling about a bunch of fruit? - My style's just different from yours. - Oh, it's not a matter of style. So we see the world differently. Maybe we're looking for different things. The point is, til you feel something here, you can't reveal it here. - You're right. It's your exhibit anyway and I'm just not ready. - Nonsense. You're a marvelous painter. And I would love to have some of your work included in the exhibit. But this is an exercise. If you want to be an artist you have to take a risk. Find something you don't own completely. Something that you feel so deeply that you can't imagine you could ever possibly paint it. Paint that. - He was a cute little boy wasn't he? - Mmm hmm. - He didn't turn out too bad. - He'll do. - Well he's definitely not your typical guy. I didn't know if you'd be back after last time. - You saw? - No, Sam told me. You know, sometimes he can be a little intense. - Really? - Oh yes. He once told me that he didn't think it was proper for a woman my age to be singing and dancing in the kitchen. He was five. - No. - Well despite all his quirks he has a good heart. He wouldn't push so hard if he didn't care. - This is all very important to him isn't it? - Yeah, in a way it's who he is. - Jo, are you telling tales on our son? - Only the most embarrassing ones. - Good! I'll join in. - We were just talking about Sam's escapades the last time Charly was here. - Oh yes, praying backyard. Classic Roberts family dating technique. Smooth, subtle. - It worked for you. - Behave kids. - We've always been somewhat of an embarrassment to him. - So what are we talking about? - That should do it, thank you. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. Who's that? - You are going to love this. Turn me on. - Oh yes. Oh yeah, I'd know those legs anywhere. Hi. - Alright Mark, what are you up to? - I just wanted to see your beautiful face. And get your professional opinion. These are samples for my new line. I'll leave next week on a sales trip to push them, what do you think? - Mark, why do they have our names on the front? - What? Hey? Whoa! Wow, that is, what a coincidence. Which one do you like better? - Why do you wanna get married Mark? - Honestly? Well I moved from two drawers into a closet, I get my name on the mailbox, and I get a controlling share of the remote control. Darling, come on, I'm teasing you here. You know how I feel about you. - How long do you plan on feeling that way? - Well, let's see. According to this one, oh until the stars fall from the sky and the earth stops spinning. - No, seriously Mark. Do you honestly believe two people can be so happy together they want it to last forever? - Happily ever after? It's kind of a cliche notion don't you think? Yeah, I think so. - What does that mean? Happily ever after. After what? After taxes? - After the divorce. Darling, I, maybe it means like a surprise kind of. Hmm, they are happy after all. Where is all this coming from? Is that desert air getting to ya? - Don't you ever wonder if there's something more? - Life is for fun. You take the chances that it gives you and you make the best of it. I mean what else is there? - That's just it, I don't know. Excuse me! Yes you. Is the fishing any better over there because we are having no luck over here. - Shh. - Sorry! Don't tell me it's a fish finder too. - Time to move. - You know, you might have more luck if you just snuck up on the little fishy's. You know, catch 'em by surprise. Hey, hey! - It's just a tire. - That is no tire! - Come on. - I got me a fish! What do I do, what do I do?! Set the hook. - Get away! Come meet me snail! Woo! Wait up for the rookie! Come on little fishy come on! Come to mama. Oh, it's kinda little. I suppose you all know why we've asked you here this morning! Because some of you have been putting marshmallows on your hooks! The Utah Fish And Game department has asked Ne to speak today. Clinical research just released indicates that the fish in this lake have 53% more cavities. Do you know what this means? It means the UFDD must now stand the expense of sending a trout through dental school. Nice. Where we going Sam? - Away. - Oh I embarrassed you is that it? Go ahead, say it. - You embarrassed me. - No. No Sam, this is where you stop rowing and throw water on me. It's what we call a water fight. Can you say that for me dear? Water fight. It is one of those happy spontaneous things people do in this dull world. You got no sense of fun. Life is for laughing. - I laugh. - No, you, smile friendly. Oh no good to forced, not spontaneous. - I laugh responsibly. - Oh could you define that for us senator? - When the work is done, if there's time left over I laugh and I have fun. - Try again. Sam, there is never any time when the work is done. You have to laugh during the work. What would happen if this were suddenly to disappear? - Come on Charly. - Would the world stop spinning? Would your universe just careen out of space?! - That's very funny, now come on. - You want it? You'll have to get it. - You wouldn't. - Oh. Nice catch. It wasn't my fault. How was I supposed to know you'd jump in the lake? I tell you, I'm completely innocent. - You innocent? Look at this, my whole life was in this thing. - Okay, see that's the thing. Don't you find that the tiniest bit twisted? May I help you sir? - Yes, can this be fixed? - Oopsie. Don't suppose you have flood insurance? No of course not. Tell you what. I'll go to talk to my manager and see if your warranty covers... - Women. - Pardon me? - Actually only one. See if my warranty covers Charlene Riley. - A woman sir. - Charlene Riley. R-I-L-E-Y. Sam, Sammy this is mommy do you hear me? - There she is now. Sammy this is mommy. The nice man in the store let me talk to you on their big radio. - Sir your mother did this to you. - Actually it was my dad. It all started with my dad. Sammy, if you can hear me listen carefully. Mommy's sorry Sammy. I'll but you a new toy. Just don't be angry anymore. Remember when mommy bought you a big bag of popcorn last week? Sam, go to the popcorn machine. Mommy has a big bag of popcorn for you. Oh, and Sammy, mommy loves you dear. Oh poor little guy. - You have no idea. - Hi Sammy. What? I said I was sorry. Remember where we are. And you admit it wasn't my fault? - Sir your phone! Keep it! - Hi Charly and Mark, we're not in right now but you can leave a message. Unless it's really important, in which case we just prefer you keep it to yourself. Your choice at the beep. Mark, Charly, we need to talk. Please call. - Good afternoon, welcome to The Museum of Fine Arts. - Thank you, I'm excited to be here. - Are you familiar with our gallery? - Only generally. I moved here from New York to help my grandmother establish an art school and so I'm constantly looking for opportunities for the students. - Excellent, if you have any questions about anything don't hesitate to ask. And I'll just have you leave your purse up front with me. I'll keep an eye on it. - Okay, thank you very much. - You bet. - Pardon me Miss, the gallery's closing. It's okay, take your time. - Mark I'm not going to be home when you get back. I'm sorry, I'll try to explain later. What do you think? - You haven't said much about the church since I tried to pray with you. - Which church? - Oh come on you know. - Yeah well I decided to be fair. We easterners are noted for our fairness. - Oh yeah, I've heard about the Salem Witch trials. - Not bad Sam. Stick with me and I will make you a witch. You're halfway there now. I've read The Book of Mormon. Nice technique. You did? - You're not gonna make us kneel down and pray in this boat are you? - No. - Play along I thought. Take the lessons, go to church, leave them laughing. It's all part of the Utah tour. - And? - I'm from New York. The Museum of Natural History, the Hayden Planetarium, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You know what I'm saying? - No, what are you saying? - I'm not like you. I am an intellectual. - So? - I believe it. All the rotten luck. - You're kidding me, you do?! - Now don't rub it in Utah. - It's a miracle! - Have you gone completely insane? - This is terrific! What's wrong? - Nobody's going to understand this. My parents will think I'm crazy. - Well tell them to pray about it. - Okay that's what got us into this whole mess. I've been hoisted up on my own petard. - Oh that can be painful. I hit my petard once playing baseball. - Oh Sam. What have we done to each other? - Charly you're not, you're not doing this 'cause of my... - Your personal charm and magnetism? - Something like that. - You are kinda cute. But no. Sam when I read that book, I feel something. You wanna know something else? I'm praying. Someone is listening. You're winning. - I'm cheating. But don't tell your father. That's how I subsidize my social security. He's pretty worried about you you know. They both are. When you were a little girl you said you wanted to run away and join the circus, remember? Your parents did everything. They told you that midgets were actually run away children and that they fed little girls to the lions. But you didn't listen. Do you remember what I did? - You took me to the circus. - And after we'd been there for a while, you decided it wasn't what you really wanted after all. That's how I thought this Mormon business would sort out. It hasn't worked out that way has it? I may not agree with all the Mormon ways, heaven knows if God's gonna put us through this life the least he can do is allow us a few good stiff drinks along the way. Just make sure you're doing things for the right reason. And if you feel it's right, then everyone else can just go sit on a pin. - Thanks. - You're sure this is what you want? - It just feels right. I have never felt like this. I like this clean slate thing. You believe it right? - No. I know it. You have 24 messages. Mark, Charly. I need to talk, please call. Hey Charly this is Sandra, I got a question for ya. Call me at my studio. Hey Mark honey, this is your mother. I haven't heard from you lately. Mark, I'm not going to be home when you get back, I'm sorry. I'll try to explain later. Mark are you there? This is Edward, it's about Charly. Something's changed. Charly's seeing someone new. Someone though I never thought I'd say it, worse than you. I strongly suggest you get out here! Mark, call your mother! - Charly. Charly is that you?! Oh! - What are you doing in Utah? - Oh business. But then I heard about your grandmothers exhibit and I just had to come. What are you doing in Utah?! - Well I came out for a visit, but I'm thinking of making it permanent. - Oh, are you and Mark gonna keep your place in New York or have you convinced him to pull up stakes and move out west? - Mark's in New York. Felicia, I'd like you to meet Sam. Sam, this is Felicia. - Oh. - She's an old friend from school. - Hello, it's so nice to meet you Sam. I knew this lady before she could color in the lines. You know? Well, I've gotta go! It's been wonderful seeing you again Charly. Let's get together before I leave. You know, catch up on old times. Charmed. - Hi. Come on, I've got something to show you. - You were living with someone? - I told you I was practically engaged Sam. It never occurred to you the he and I lived, that we... Of course not, why would it. I'm not living with him now. - Does he know that? - Why Sam, I think you're jealous. - Charly. - Mark? What are you doing? Mark. Sam this is my, Mark Randolph. Mark, this is Sam Roberts. - We fish together. - She's being modest Sam. Well not too long ago Charly had me absolutely convinced I couldn't live without her. I almost had her convinced as well. There's always time right? - I guess so. - So Mark, what brings you out this way? You're the last person I thought I'd see here tonight. - Obviously. - Mark had some very pressing business in town and needed a place to stay. - Naturally we couldn't let him stay in a hotel dear. - Naturally. - And when he heard the exhibit was opening tonight... - I insisted on coming down. Frankly Charly, I'm a little disappointed. Usually these things are so much more lively. - Well Sam has introduced me to a totally new way at looking at life. You know, that's what Ed and Clair were telling me. - Well you know Charlene always full of surprises. - That's why I love her. You just never know what she's gonna do next. - Yeah, well some things never change. I can see you're busy. Sam, wait up! Don't go, let's talk. - How could you do this to me? - To you?! - You're not who I thought you were. - Sam, I had a life before I met you. I did! But it was different then and I was different then. Sam. Sam look at me. You introduced me to a new way of life. But it's not going to mean much to me unless you're a part of it. A permanent part. Sam I think I just told you I love you. Sam please say something. What do you want? - I don't know. Not used merchandise. Something on your mind mom? - Home early aren't you? - Charly wasn't perfectly honest with me. - Oh? - Turns out she has a past. - Most of us do. - You know what I mean. She's not a... A virgin? - I just can't get it out of my head. I can't stop thinking about her. She's just not who I thought... - You'd fall in love with. It seems like she's done a lot of changing the last few weeks. So have you. - That's not the point. - No? - No, I thought you'd understand. - Well maybe she thought you would too. - What is this? What about wait until you're married and now you're saying that it doesn't matter... - It does matter Sam. Your whole life we've taught you that intimacy should be connected to eternal commitment. And you've waited to find someone who felt the same way. And it's wonderful, it is, but... - Charly obviously doesn't believe in that. - Well maybe she didn't. Or she maybe she understood it differently. But now... - No, it doesn't matter. Nothing changes the fact that she was unfaithful. - To who? To you? Someone she just met? To your principles? Principles she didn't understand or share until recently? Does knowing about her past change the way you feel about her? Well then, she's better off without you isn't she? I have never felt like this. I like this clean slate thing. You believe it, right? - No. - Earth's crammed with heaven. And every common bush a fire with God. But only he who sees takes off his shoes. - I've been so blind. - Yes. Well, love's like that sometimes. - I gotta find her. - She won't be there. She left right after you did. New York. - Alone? Southwest flight 1430 to New York. - Dad, dad, I know please. I'll pay you back every penny I promise. Just please do me this favor.

I've come 2,000 miles to see you. - Well, you've seen me. - I was wrong! - That's right, when all else fails, grovel. - You wrong? Impossible. - You were right. I was jealous.

Okay maybe it is. Please understand. I know I am not being fair about this. But I've changed. I don't want the same things I wanted before. - You want him? Is that what this is about? - It's about shelling peas. Kisses that mean something. Lives that do too. It's about being so sure about one thing that everything else falls away. - Well what has fallen away? Oh. I see. - I'm sorry. - I'll send a car to pick up the rest. Look Charly, I don't know what happened to you in Salt Lake, but I would like to. Because my feelings for you haven't changed.

I want you back. I'm not upset with you anymore. - How nice for you. We're in the middle of class Sam. - I probably would've done the same thing. I mean not with Mark but... - Oh sorry. She's, she's... - Without clothing, yes. You were saying? - The main thing is I forgive you. - You forgive me? - No, no, of course not I mean yes. No that's not it at all. I don't care about that anymore. - What's going on here? - Nose bleed. - Can we go someplace and talk? Ms. Riley. - I have class. - Later then? - I can't. - Why? - Ms. Riley? - That's really none of your business. - Charly wait. I wanna be a part of your life. Not this part but... - Why? Sam, you couldn't handle just one thing from my life. My past life. Life is too short and too hard to not feel safe with the one you love. You've given me something I'll have forever. I just can't have it with you. Go home Sam. Marko. - Polo! - How did you get in? - I told Henry I forgot my keys. - You said you wanted to talk. - There'll be plenty of time to talk. Later. You remember St. Angelo's? - Yeah, didn't the health department close that place down? - Horrible miscarriage of justice. It was late one evening, I had come in for a dozen hot wings and there she was. The most extraordinarily gorgeous woman I'd ever seen. Sitting in front of an Angelo's gargantuan. Our eyes met and she winked. - I never winked. - Pardon me miss, this is my story. She winked. Invitingly. I sat down beside her. - It was a big pizza. - And then her date arrived. - How inconvenient. - He thought they were getting it to go. - You decided to stay. - Poor fella. Cute but predictable. - Maybe she likes predictable. - Not this girl. She'd never paint by the numbers. She might find someone special, but she'd never settle. Not for someone like him. - What if she changed? - She wouldn't. Not really. - How do you know? - Because I'm sitting beside her right now. And it's as though she never left. - Hey! You can't be in here! - You better go. - I don't have to. - Yes you do. - But tonight I got pizza and... - Yeah tonight, it was all about how things used to be. - And how they can be again. - Not for me. - Get away from her! You, you New Yorker! - Wow, handsome and witty. - Sam, what are you doing? - Charly you can't marry him. - I know. - You love me, you said so yourself. Wait, you know? - You know, why don't you get out of here buddy. - No I won't leave! Charly I love you! - You know that particular argument doesn't seem to be working tonight. - Is he supposed to be here? - No. - Wait! All my life I've been waiting for this woman! The woman of my dreams and suddenly I find myself in love with you! Haven't you had the wrong dreams? - What? - The wrong dreams, I had the wrong dreams! Charly! - Sorry about that folks. - Wow. Where were we? I remember. Goodbye. - I am so sorry. - Don't be. We had fun while it lasted. Didn't we? Luckily the judge was sympathetic to my plight. She promised to forget the whole thing if I left the city immediately. Next time she suggested I send a nice note with a bouquet of roses.

He understood about that. But, I said, "I still love him." - What did he say? - He said I was probably a glutton for punishment.

Maybe you should give him a smile or something, he looks depressed. - He's supposed to look depressed. His friend just died. - Huh? - Lazarus, Mary and Martha's brother Lazarus. - Oh. - Before he raised him from the dead, Christ wept. - Ouch. - It's not my fault. If I had a studio... - I need my office Charles. - Yeah, well I'd be willing to share. And besides, if I had a proper studio I'd have more kitchen space to whip up culinary masterpieces. The likes of which you have only glimpsed tonight. You didn't like it? - It was good. - Good. - Very creative. - Creative?! - Hey hey! - Ouch ouch. - What's wrong? You okay? - Yeah, it's a sore muscle. I'm just tired I guess. - You've been tired a lot lately. - Yeah, well pardon me Mr. Roberts, have you met your son? Short little guy, crawls around a lot. - Oh, is that who that is? - Mmm, that's who that is. - I know exactly what you need. A night out on the town.

What else? - Well Sam and I like to make love. - Bishop. Dada. - Why does he always do that? Mama, mama. Dada, Dada. Dada. - You can't leave me, not now! - Okay. Out of my way. Had enough of you and your motorcycle gang. - But Bob, what about the baby. - Probably not even mine. So for all I know, he's Freddy's. That goofy eyed bleeble on check stand seven. - I admit at one time I did find Freddy irresistible. But that was just a fling. In my heart, I have always loved you. - Liar! I don't even believe you! You've broken my heart for the last time Beulah. We're through. - How can you say such a thing when I have stuck with you through the stock market crash and the ingrown toenails and that highly contagious case of swine fever! - You laughed, you laughed, you laughed! - You laughed first! - It was a cough! - You so laughed first! - Nasty stuff swine fever. - Nice try Bob, you lose. Diaper duty for a week. - This is no sore muscle. - Of course it is. Okay, okay you might be right, but just this once. - Just stay still okay. - Mr. Roberts, your wife has cancer. Mr. Roberts? - Go on I'm listening. - The tumor started in the pancreas. That's probably why it went undetected til now. I'm afraid the cancer has spread. So are we talking surgery, radiation? - I'm afraid surgery is out of the question at this point. We can try some aggressive chemotherapy if that's your wish. - Let's do it, let's get started. - Mr. Roberts I need to be perfectly honest with you. Chemotherapy is rarely effective in a case like this. Even if your wife responds favorably to the treatment, the best we can hope for is to shrink the tumor. Slightly prolonging a little time that she has left. Time she has left? - Mr. Roberts your wife is dying. I'm truly sorry. It's out of our hands, there's nothing we can do. - How are you? - I hope I look better than you do. I hate to break this to you, I have severe halitosis. And a really nasty case of terminal cancer. There, I said it. - Hey, there are treatments. - I've talked to the doctors. - Doctors don't know everything. People beat this thing all the time. Hey. I will give you a blessing and God will do the rest. You'll see. Charly, your father in heaven is aware of your struggle. He wants... I want to bless you. I bless you that through your faith and obedience and the faith and obedience of your family that you will live. The treatments will work and you won't die. Heavenly father loves you. He loves me and Adam. I love you. I bless you Charly. I bless you to live. What are you doing? - Thinking. Have you noticed his cow lick part here? No matter what I do it always sticks straight up. I wonder what it'll look like in a year when it grows out. - We'll just have to wait and see. - A one year survival rate for my type of cancer is zero Sam. Zero. - So we'll beat the odds. - Really stiff odds. - What are you saying? - Sometimes when we want something bad enough... - You wanna give up, is that what you're saying? - I don't wanna give up. I don't wanna give up what time I have left. I wanna be here with you and with Adam. Not tethered to some IV pole dying in a hospital room. - I would never let that happen. - If what the doctors say is true... It's not. - Everything inside me tells me it is. - The Lord will come through for us Charly. We just have to have faith and give him a chance. - Borrowing some huge miracle. - Exactly. - You honestly think the treatments will work? - Yes. - Alright. He said they checked my progress after the first series of treatments. If it's working we'll continue. If not... - They'll work. I know it. - I hope so too. - So do you have any children? A little boy. - How old is he? - 10 months. Oh that's nice. - Almost done. - It's gonna be good. I'll see your rice pudding and raise you one orange jello delight. - Call. - Read 'em and eat. - You are cheating. - Prove it. You keep losing like this and the doctor's gonna have to put you on a diet. That boy loves you. - I know. I can't reach him. It's like I'm already dead. - No, that's what he wants to prevent dear. In the only way he knows how. Ignore it and maybe it'll go away. - That makes no sense. - It's always worked with your father. It's not you. Not really. He's frightened and he's running. Can you blame him? If he stops all this might catch up with him and then what? Come on, eat up. I've got a lot riding on this main course. What's all this? - It's your studio. I decided you could use it more than I could. What do you think? I think we could... - I never told you why I first fell in love with you did I? - You have a lifetime to show me. - No I don't. - Knock it off. - Who's going to use this thing once you finish it? The paint's got a longer guarantee on it than I do. - You don't know that. We have lived good lives, we've been faithful. And God will keep his promises. - God never promised us he'd cure my cancer. He promised us we could be together forever. Even after death. Dying is just still part of the deal. Sam. Sam. I am going to die. - They don't know that! Why are you giving up? Why?! You can't give up! He says he's a God of miracles! Well why not now, I've done my part! All I want is one, lousy, little miracle! Is it too much to ask?! - It is not the end. Not really. You taught me that. Who needs more time? We've got eternity. - What if I was wrong? What if there's nothing after this and it's, and it's just a lie? - It doesn't feel like a lie. - We had tomorrow til yesterday. - So ask. - Hey God you up there? - Something like that. That was it. - What? - In a world full of people afraid to believe in anything, it was your wide eyed, obstinate, happily ever after faith in life, in God. And in me. It has gotten us this far and don't you dare back out on me now. - I can't do this. - No, but we can. With his help we can. Mommy Adam. Mommy. Mommy, can you please say it? Mommy Adam, mommy. You can say my name baby. Adam I'm your mommy, please remember me. - You look like you could use a drink. How are things? - I prayed, I pleaded, I promised. But... - The treatments? - Christ heals the sick left and right. He raises people from the dead without even breaking a sweat. When he runs up against one tiny little tumor. 11 centimeters. 11 centimeters. The distance between life and death and nothing. - How's Charly? - Charly's given up just like the rest of you. - Sam. - I keep thinking it's me. Maybe if I'd exercise more faith or, maybe it's a test. Maybe if I had more time... - Maybe not. - No! I know God can do this, I know it. - Sam you've got to face the fact that your faith may not fix this. - Then what's it good for huh? What?! Why have faith if it's only good for Bible stories, and fairytales, and filling sacral meeting talks. And then when it really counts... - When it really counts it won't abandon you. The pain may block everything else for a while but slowly, slowly the stab will dull to an ache. And then if you have faith in all of those answers you've been carrying around for a lifetime, well, then the pain won't give way to emptiness. And neither will you. Neither will you. - Charly! What is this? - Hi. It's a party, come on. - Who are all these people? - Just a few friends. Loosen up Utah. - Hi. Charly used the term loosely to describe nearly everyone she'd ever met. There was her doctor. And a boy who'd carried her groceries out to her car each week. The policeman who'd ticketed her for speeding. And a counselor from West Ridge Academy where Charly taught art to struggling youth. And our neighbors. With the word neighbor defined as anyone living on the road we lived on. As I looked at her that night, I could almost believe it would last forever. I wanted to etch every moment. Every movement into memory. But it seemed like she just kept slipping away. And I couldn't shake the fear that I might never see her again. Charly? Charly? What's wrong? - I want my baby. - Are you okay? - I want my baby. Come on. Come on. Please help me. Please, I'm so scared. I'm so sorry. - Sam. Sam. Call my mom. I wanna go out. It can't wait. - Here's mama. - Hi baby. - Can you say mama? - Mama. Dada. - It's been a marvelous ride hasn't it? - The best. - I don't want it to end. - It won't. - Glutton for punishment. I love you. - You better. - Oh. - All this time I had hoped and prayed for a miracle. Maybe I'd missed it. Maybe the real miracle was all around me. Perhaps the greatest miracle of all was that I could let her go and never lose her. Why? I don't know. I don't think God explains why. Not because he isn't listening or because he doesn't care. But perhaps because the reasons don't make sense. Not now anyway. When Lazarus died, Christ didn't tell his sisters everything would be all right. It wasn't. Lazarus was dead and they were in pain. Christ knew Lazarus would live. But he didn't belittle his friends grief. He didn't try to explain it away. He didn't try to dry their tears. He wept with them. He loved them. It's in that love that I trust now. The ride is not over yet Utah. I'll save your place in line, I love you. Mr. Rafferty, I'd like you to meet my fiance. He's just proposed and you're the first one we told. Sam and I want to ride your Ferris wheel for a long time, you understand?
