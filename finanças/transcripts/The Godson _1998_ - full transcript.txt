[ Groans ] [ Cat Meows ] [ Gun Firing ] [ Bullet Ricochetting ] [ Sobs ] [ Crow Cawing ] [ Man ] And that's how my life got turned around forever. My beloved older brother Sunny-- Sunny Calzone, the heir to the Calzone famiglia-- was brutally murdered by our enemies. We was all there for the sad event of his passing. There was Bugsy, Mama, Pop-- also known as the Oddfather because he's my father and he's odd-- Sunny's girl... [ Cash Register Dings ] and me, son number three, Giuseppe Calzone. But you can call me Guppy, everyone does. Shut up, Giuseppe. Giuseppe, put a lid on it. Giuseppe, shut up. Well, usually everyone does. This certainly is a grave occasion, if you'll pardon the pun. So, then, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Sunny got whacked, and it's so unjust. And thus it is that we say arrivederci to Sunny Calzone. And it was Sunny who warmed so many-- so many of our-- [ Clears Throat ] hearts.

Ah, the men who did this, I curse them to hell and beyond for eternity ! [ Echoing ] For eternity ! She's very upset. Yeah. Yeah. I want you to meet my number three son. He's a good boy, a good boy. You can call him Guppy. Everyone does... usually. Nice to meet ya, Guppy. [ Whimpers ] [ Moans ] Hand broken. [ Moans ] Where's son number two ? We don't talk about son number two. [ Mutters, Blows Raspberry ] [ Bicycle Bell Rings ] [ Guppy Narrating ] This was my neighborhood. And this was the Calzone compound, my home. It didn't look like much from the outside, but actually it was pretty nice. But I had other things to worry about. Shocking as Sunny's death was, I still didn't realize just what it was going to mean for me. A huge challenge was about to be put upon my shoulders, a challenge that would test me in ways... I never even thought of. I've been in love with you, Elaine, ever since the first time I saw you playing bass for your reggae band, thumpin' out that Rasta beat. And of all the fellows in the audience that night, you picked me, Elaine. [ Woman ] Mm-hmm. It might be the champagne talking. I don't know. But I think I'm going to-- I'm going to kiss you, Elaine. [ Crashing ] Don't you ever knock, Bugsy, hmm ? Don't call me that ! Your father wants to see you in the office. Have you met Elaine ? Don't judge me. Baby ? Guppy's got to go have a meeting. [ Whispers ] You stay here. [ Laughs ] Pop, Bugsy came in my room without knocking again-- Silence. We have more important things to discuss. This isn't about the other night again, is it ? I just wanted to see what pantyhose would look like on me. I don't care about that. I'm talkin' about the future of this family. -[ Quacking ] - Quiet down. Look at this. Giving, giving, giving all the time. Penelope, I'm very proud of you. All right, take a hike. I got something to say to my son. -[ Wings Flapping, Penelope Quacking ] - Aw, geez ! I'll tell you something. If it wasn't for the eggs-- [ Whistles ] It's a crazy world we live in. It's violent. I keep tryin' to get out, but they keep tryin' to pull me in. - Pop, are you all right ? - [ Grunts ] - What was I sayin' ? - [ Quacks ] Yeah, okay. Now that Sunny is gone, I want you to take over. I want you to be the head. I want you to be... the godson. [ Echoing ] ♪♪ [ Orchestra ] Where the hell is that music coming from ? ♪♪ Me ? But, Pop-- Once the Calzones were the biggest syndicate in the whole world, the whole wide world, you understand ? Now, with two sons dead, we have grown weak. We spent all our money on sex toys. I've done some calculations, and I have to tell you that in six months the way we're goin', we'll be bankrupt, and we're gonna be livin' in the streets. Your mission is to change the tide, to save the Calzone family, don't you understand ? We must focus our future, our future. I don't know, Dad. This is out of my league. This is way too much. - I can't accept. - [ Quacks ] If you don't, I'm gonna take this... and put it someplace where every time you dance this is gonna hurt. When do I start ? Now. Now. You lookin' at me ? You lookin' at me ? [ Guppy Narrating ] I was in a state of shock. My whole life had just been turned upside down. What was I going to do ? I asked myself. What am I gonna do ? I'm just not cut out to be a mobster, you see ? I'm just not cut out to be a mobster, you see ? Is there an echo in here ?

You can't make a sissy into a gangster. I'll never be as good as Sunny ! Never ! [ Crying ] Come in. I was in the hall, and I couldn't help but hear you.

That's what I meant when I said I'm here for you. I have to tell you something. You're my boy. [ Whimpering ] What's the matter ? I'm afraid you're gonna hit me. I'm not gonna hit you. What are you talkin' about ? I'm not gonna hit ya. I can't help myself. Aw, geez. It's the Italian way. I'm expressing love. Don't you understand ?

You have to really get in the joints if you want a clean separation. Otherwise, you're going to be sawing all day. [ Pants ] There. Pay attention, people ! This is going to be on the test. [ Whimpers ] The biggest misconception is that it's all in the arm. But actually, it's all in the wrist. Good. I think we've covered that. Now, class, I'm going to teach you... omerta, the mafia law of silence. [ Clock Ticking ] I think we've covered that. Come on, ya dirty rat, ya lily-livered fink. Where's the loot ?

For example, he calls him "pig breath." [ Chuckles ] Now, on an internal level, his emotional response would perhaps be to feel... apprehensive, hopeless or even impotent in the face of this dangerous situation. To the viewer, however, and more importantly to his enemies, this man's Teflon exterior remains seemingly unmalleable, impervious to the peril. Maybe he's sensitive, class. Maybe he wants to cry, hmm ? Maybe he'd rather go home and snuggle with his stuffed bunny ! But to do so would mean certain death. In sum, ladies and gentlemen, what one needs to be a successful employee... of La Cosa Nostra is an unshakable... and completely irrational confidence in oneself. [ Snoring ] Here. You try. All right, then, you. Go ahead. Come on, mister. Leave me alone. Who are you, Michael Jackson ? Come on ! Use a moniker of some sort. Pal, mug, pig breath. Do it again ! And just relax.

[ Class Cheering ] [ Laughs ] [ Cheering Continues ] [ Cheering Continues, Fades ] [ Guppy Narrating ] Now that I'd gotten my bachelor's degree in advance criminal science, it was time to meet the hardworking men and women of the Calzone crime family. For years I'd wanted to meet them, but I was always tied up in the closet. [ Chuckles ] There was Carmen "The Nose" Chechea, Tony "The Lung" Bananno. He was a tobacco lobbyist, of course. There was Jimmy "The Wad" Rialto. I'm not sure where he got his name. Everyone was there. There was love in the air. That's Amore. [ Woman ] Hey, Amore ! I got to meet Veronica "Thunggooey" Tetranicci, my cousin Vinny. Be sure to watch it. It's a great flick. It was beautiful. These people didn't just dream about drug running, savage murder and the ritual abuse of women, they lived it. And now, I was one of them-- No, I was their leader. For the first time in my life, I was proud to be me. Here ya go, Mr. Wise Fella, Mr. Good Guy ! You son of a bitch ! Oh, man. So, Guppy, what do you think of the family ? Bunch of wise guys, huh ? Oh, God, Father, they're good fellas. [ Laughs ] This thing ! Ooh ! I was starting to think that being a mafia chieftain wasn't going to be so bad after all. No one had even tried to kill me yet. Wow ! What was that ? I don't know, but it looks pretty, doesn't it ? [ Oddfather Screams ] Very. [ Tires Screeching, Car Horn Honks ] [ Thudding ] [ Printer Whirring ] [ Man ] Let me make this clear, Angel. If you want a career here in the F.B.I., you have to nail this cat. I want to know his every move. I want photos. I want reports. I want to know every time he sits down on the damn toilet, understand ? But-- The only "but" I want out of you, Agent Hoover, is that fuzzy little peach-like one you hide under that skirt. [ Laughs ] Now, get on it. Hoover ! Yes, sir. Don't screw up. The director is watching you on this one. [ Line Clicks, Dial Tone Hums ] [ Man Grunts, Groans ] [ Grunts ] You know something ? I'm very proud of you. - Now you have taken over. - Ooh ! Tomorrow you will meet all the heads of all the families. Are you ready ? I'm ready. Ah, see ? This is how I got Jake LaMotta. I held him like this until he gave me all his Tootsie Rolls. Yeah, I held him like this. I never let him go. You know why ? Because he betrayed me. [ Whimpers ] Pop, whatever did happen to Frito ? I told you I don't want to discuss that. What could he have done that was so bad ? He did the unthinkable. He did the unimaginable. He did the unforgivable. - He got a regular job. - Red rum. Red rum. Oh, my God. How could he ? [ Groans ] Yeah, well, I'll tell you the truth. It broke my heart. [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] They're, um, doing yoga, sir. [ Indistinct ] Yes, I know mobsters usually don't do yoga, but these ones are, sir. [ Man On Radio ] Hoover, you there ? Shh ! Sir, there's a strange man here with a crossbow. -[ Man On Radio ] What ? - [ Groans ] I'm afraid I've been hit, sir. Over and out. [ Body Thuds ] Oops. [ Groans ] Mmm ! It was time for the annual top secret... shareholders meeting of Murder, Incorporated. I was gonna meet the most powerful dons in the country. It was Don Juan De Marco, I would love to get to know you better. Don Quixote, Don Ho, Don E. Brasco, Hey, forget about it. Don King and Don Pardo. [ Man On P.A. ] I'd like to announce that all guests are staying at the Park Plaza Hotel. Thank you. Thank you, Don Pardo. Now, beat it. And finally I met him, the most vile man in New York City, the Rodfather ! I got-- Oh. I was-- No, this way. [ Growls ] Oh, Don Calzone, I'm sorry to hear about the death of your son. - It was very nice-- [ Mutters ] - Speak up, will ya ? - It was very nice-- [ Mutters ] - That's better. Okay. Hi, gentlemen. I'm very happy that this meeting is taking place... and for the conglomerations together... and conjugating this way, especially that we're doing it in peace. It really makes my heart very happy. Is this the meeting of the Doms ? This is Dons, pal. Doms are next week. Wanna buy a book while I'm here ? - Pass. - Your mother's ass. Ooh ! [ Blows Raspberry ] I appreciate your consolation and your symphony. Now, listen, gentlemen. I am old, I am frail... and I am losing control of my bladder big time. Goin' down stairs is a bitch. Therefore, my son Guppy here... is going to take over control of the Calzone family. [ Group Exclaiming ] Wait, wait, whoa. You will answer to him completely. My son Guppy has all my condiments. Is that clear ? Take over. Good to see that everyone is here. Now, let's get down to business. First of all-- Ooh ! - Oh, shit. - [ Laughing ] [ Shouting ] Yes ! - Someone sabotaged my chair ! - [ Laughing ] Sorry, Pop. I think I swallowed my toothpick. It's wonderful to meet you, Guppy. Tell me, how long you been outta the water ? Hey, Don King, you look like you just saw my wife naked. A toast. Your mother's ass. -L'chayim. -Forget about it.

[ Screams, Grunts ] -This is Frito. - As in my older brother Frito ? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Frito's back home. Oh, shit. Welcome back, my brother. Welcome back ! I ain't here to deliver the mail, little brother. I've come to take what is rightfully mine ! Anything. Anything you want is yours. - Anything ? Anything ? - Yeah. Really. I want my position as the rightful heir to this family. Anything but that. Let's be realistic. Pop ! Pop ! Get away from me. How can you make him the godson ? Look at him ! He's such a popagolch. I'm older. I deserve the throne to this family. You can have Dad's Cutlass. I don't want my father's Oldsmobile. I want what is... mine ! Oh !

What are you talkin' French for ? You're Italian. [ Guppy Narrating ] Now that I had taken over, the Rodfather wanted to have dinner. Said he had a little plan. Wanted to talk to me about it. Say hello to Tracy's Dick. I mean, Tracy Dick ! Nice to see you again, Dick ! It's Mr. Dick to you ! [ Growls ] Bugsy ! No ! [ Oddfather ] Go with the meeting. But let me say I'm glad we called this peace. I just hope it lasts. That's all. - You think I'm funny ? - Yes, you were very funny. - You think I'm funny ? - I'm hearing an echo in here. What does that mean ? Do you think I'm funny, or do you think I'm funny ? I just thought what you did was, you know, funny. So now you think I'm funny. That it ? [ Laughing ] Yes. Now, that's funny. The machine gun bit. Good old-fashioned funny. You're not bein' funny. You're bein' an effin' wacko. Put away the piece before ya break a nail. What the-- Now you think I'm funny ? - Pop, she shot at me ! - That's dames for ya. Damn ! I did break a nail. You guys must come from a rough part of town. You kiddin' ? One day they raffled off a police car with two cops still in it. My building, nothin' but robberies. Every time I close a window, I hit somebody's fingers. So... what's the story, morning glory ? Airplane glue. There's a huge shipment coming in to the docks tomorrow night. We want to steal it and sell it to small children throughout the nation. We need your protection. I'll give you protection. Here ya go. Here. Take this. Not that, Oddfather. Oh, extra large. Hey, Oddfather, did I ever meet you in prison ? You look familiar. Turn around. Anyway, we need your influence with the police, the unions, city hall. You know what I'm saying. The other families would be upset if you deny us. Capisce ? No thanks, I already ate, but why do you want kids gluing airplanes together for ? It's not to build airplanes, idiot. It's to sniff. Like a dog meets another dog, capisce ? Oh ! Oh. That might kill them. The cost of doing business. Now let the men talk and shut up. Speak to the hand, not the face ! Listen up, Rodfather. We ain't helpin' out any airplane glue business. Or any other kind of business unless I say so ! Get it ? What ? It's all set up ! I like kids, Roddy. I don't see any reason to kill them. Call off the deal ! Oddfather, your son's got olive oil in his brain. He's making a serious error. Nevertheless, he's the one who's making the decisions, and I agree with him because I feel you shouldn't hurt children until they're grown up. Look ! We're going into airplane glue with or without you ! Who cares ? Nobody tells the godson what to do. - [ Scoffs ] - Bugsy, let's go. [ Oddfather ] Take me with you. Giuseppe Calzone, I will break him. I will break him like a baby's finger. [ Guppy Narrating ] It was time to get down to business, make some money, restore the Calzone family. Bugsy had the first great idea. We'd open a little dancing palace. He knew just the place. He said 4334 Amsterdam Avenue. But I bought 4334 1/2 Amsterdam Avenue. It was half priced. It wasn't quite the success I imagined. For some reason, none of my mafia friends came. Can I stop now, for God sake ? Sure, Judy. Take five. And don't blame yourself for the poor attendance. You're a fine dancer. All right then, nobody else's gonna dance, then I will. [ Guppy Narrating ] Yeah, it didn't do that well as a business. But it wasn't a total loss. I did learn a few new dance steps. [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] [ Man On Phone Speaker ] What is this crap, Angel ? You expect this to bring down the most powerful man in the mob ? The director is not impressed. Sir, I-- The only "I" I want to see out of you, sugar puff, is that gorgeous blue one I see when I wake up next to ya. Get something better unless you want to be flippin' burgers by the end of the week. [ Dial Tone Hums ] Yeah, suck my toe. That's it. Suck it harder ! [ Laughs ] Now, look at that. You've gone and made such a mess. Bad boy, very bad. [ Guppy Narrating ] Plan number two was a guaranteed winner. That's beautiful, baby. Now put on my bra. I had moved the family into the "telecommunicatory bid-ness." Now take both jumper cables and put them on each nipple. People were callin' by the hundreds. We were gonna make a fortune. He's coming this way. Um, kiss it ? Yes, I'll kiss it. Uh-huh. What ? Give me the lollipop, Daddy. Yes, you can keep the beer mug on my head. Yes, I'll lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick ! Are you satisfied, you effin' pervert ? Good job. Good job. - Bugsy ? - [ Growls ] Alice. Mmm ! These 900 numbers are a gold mine, Alice. How much are we makin' ? 900 ? Mm-hmm. Did you say 900 ? 900, 800, what's the difference ? You told me 800. You clearly said, "Bugsy, I want you to set up a bunch of 800 dirty numbers." Yeah, so what ? It doesn't matter. Oh, Alice, I'm sorry. No, Alice, you were right. I-- I suck, Dad. Oh, I suck. No. Every plan I come up with fails. I'll never rebuild the family in time. Naw. I'll never be a good mobster. Let's face life. Listen to me. You have two months left. But you know what they say: no falls, no balls. I know what everybody's thinking. What ? This guy ain't mafia material. No. This guy couldn't organize a yard sale. Naw. This guy has premature ejaculation problems. No. Why, you should see a mechanic, you know. It could be the battery. You never know. What they're thinking is, if only Sunny were alive. Aw, geez. I miss him so much. Okay, fellas, joke's over. Funny ! [ Laughs ] I got it ! Now let me outta here ! Let me outta here ! If only Sunny were alive. Yeah. Hey, I wonder if we should dig up his grave and see if he's really dead. Maybe he's down there living on worms, praying we'll come and save him. What are you, crazy ? No. Guess I am a bit crazy. Yeah, so-- Dig up his grave. How much money would that cost ? Oh, yeah. And the man-hours. A shitload. [ Guppy Narrating ] Things weren't going so great, I admit. Every business venture I tried was, well, a complete failure. I'd blown $1.4 million learning the difference between 800 and 900 numbers. I was a failed mafia chieftain. People everywhere wanted me dead. And I was still a virgin, but all was not lost. I still had plan number three. My mom always said, "If you can't make money, marry into money." That's exactly what I planned to do. Romeo ? Romeo ? Romeo ? Oh, dude ! Romeo ? Romeo ? Oh ! [ Grunts, Thuds ] Romeo, if that's you, this isn't funny. [ Whimpering ] [ Snarling ] Where the hell are you, Romeo ? Right here, my precious. Guppy ? God. What are you doing here ? I've come to free you, my love. [ Scoffs ] [ Whispers ] Thanks. [ Chuckles ] [ Clears Throat ] "I have always wanted you, my sweet, "to run a feather across your feet, "to feel your soft lips in a love-locked kiss. "I imagine heaven can't be as good as this. "To live and never love you is all I've ever feared. "To go through life and never feel the touch of your downy beard. "I will sit on your very best chair. "I will rub your silky, soft chest hair. To feel your muscles--" What is this ? Isn't that what you wanted ? Didn't you say, "Bugsy, get me a book on light poetry, gay, light, joyful" ? Okay, all right, fine. No time for that now. Thank you. Hey, what's with the noise ? It's that damn Guppy Calzone again. I'm gonna whack him, Daddy. I'm gonna whack him. Look, I got my own problems. Look at this, will ya ? And your mother wasn't that nice either. I told her I hurt my little pinkie. She said, "It's all right. We're not gonna have sex anyway." Oh, come on, Daddy. Can I whack him just once ? Just kill him just once, please ! No, no, this is all part of the master strategy. You won't kill him. You'll go out on a date with him. A date ? Oh, you mean, we can always kill the Calzones, but we'd make too many enemies, therefore, we must destroy them, right ? - Right. - Then you whacked Sunny. It must have been hard on you to see a man like that die without pain. I've seen so many guys die with pain, I figured I'd break it up a little bit. Now, I'll make little Guppy the puppy fall in love with me, and the Oddfather will have no choice but to disown him. Daddy, you're brilliant.
