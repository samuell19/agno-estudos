(chuckles) It's a H.P. Lovecraft story. This mad mathematician named Vespuli just plucked his own frickin' eye out. Nasty. What's with the bags? (Alice sighs) Here, read this. Hm. Wow. Drew's parents have some nerve to send you some snail mail letter after what he did to you. Mm-mm. - I know, right? - Yeah. Their precious little boy beats the shit out of me, makes me lose my baby, and now this? You fucking bitch. You really did it this time, didn't you? You... Are nothing. Without me! (somber piano music) I went and talked to an old professor, and he told me that there's a place right by the campus where I can get a room and no one will find me. Oh, you're perfectly safe here. (sighs) Look, Kel, I really appreciate you letting me stay with you for the past few months. [Kelly] Of course. But I have to get out of here. He's gonna find me and he's gonna kill me. I know he will. [Kelly] Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry. Come here. Why is this happening to me, Kelly? (brooding orchestral music) (birds tweet) (knocks) Hello? Hello? Anyone there? (low-pitched piano keys drone) What're you doing in my house? Uh, sorry. I knocked and no one came, so- And that gives you the right to just walk in? Well, there must be a misunderstanding. Professor Sherfick sent me and he said that you might have a room for rent? Look, I have money, and please, I need to be here, I can feel it. (sighs) I suppose you can stay in the attic. Follow me. - Thank you. - Don't say that yet. You have not seen it. (suspenseful music) (keys clink) There's a lot of junk in here. Maybe an old bed or a mattress you can use. Most of the stuff can go out to the dumpster for all I care, but if you think you can use somethin' up here, you're more than welcome to it. I'll take it. Thank you, I really- No loud parties, no beer bottles, no squeaky mattresses. Don't leave food out. We have a corn field across the street, so you will see a mouse from time to time. Do you, um- I stay in the back of the house, should there be an emergency. My niece Tommi, she's around here somewhere, and my brother Joe lives downstairs. People say he's crazy. He just loves Jesus and his whisky. You don't bother him, he won't bother you. Uh, do you have a key for me? [Etta] I'll get you one made tomorrow. Don't leave food out. (door squeaks) (door slams) (brooding orchestral music) (flask lid clacks) (flask lid clacks) (gasps) Oh, hey. Hi, I'm Alice. I'm just moving into the attic. Have you been saved? Oh. You must be Joe.

Do you know how many rooms are in this house? She definitely could've gotten a better one for you. You know, I'm gonna have her fix this. No, wait! I wanna be up here. No, you don't. This house is infested with rats and probably most of 'em are up here with god knows what else. Oh. This is perfect. I mean, look at the suggested geometric shapes. It's perfect for my studies. Well, if it's any consolation for scaring the living shit out of you, uh, I could help you set up your room? Yeah, I'll just take you up on that. (jaunty arcade music) (coins clink) Yeah! Look at that car right there. Yeah! It has like, you could pick your- Come on, guys, it's time for cake! [Boy] Yeah! Don't you wanna open up your presents? - Yeah. - All right!

Well, first off, let me start by saying, um, that what a dream of a lifetime it is to have you mentor me. I'm astonished with what you've been able to accomplish. Thank you. Although your work does border on science-fiction, I am intrigued by some of the connections you were able to draw between three-dimensional geometry and the way we perceive these angles. See, I am trying to prove that structures are built for several different reasons. One, as a place, um, for worship or living, and two, as a gateway to somewhere else. Another plane, another dimension, um... (sighs) Like, the Egyptians, the Druids and Stonehenge. Like the Nazis at Wewelsburg in their magic castle? Yes, exactly! These places exist and with the use of sacred geometry and architecture, I believe these people gained certain powers or abilities that we don't quite fully understand. I do have a few concerns and if you want my help, you're gonna have to work around my very busy schedule. And, uh, one more thing. - Uh-huh. - Go over these notes. Okay. They will help you get caught up, as well as help you with your research. Um, thank you. I appreciate it. You're very welcome. Just make sure you're at my next lecture. (dark orchestral music) I don't like anyone being here. Anyway, Thomas in a, I'm going to the back of the house. Make sure you turn everything off when you're done. Hey. How was your meeting? Oh, it went well, thanks. That's good. So, could I call you Thomas in a, too? No. (Alice giggles) - Oh, come on. - No. So, why do you let her talk to you like that anyhow? Like, don't you get sick of that? I just don't let her bother me. She's kind of my only sane relative. All right, well, (clears throat) Have you lived here your whole life or what? - Pretty much. - Yeah? So, does she... Does your aunt know the history of the house? Can we maybe talk to her about it sometime? I mean, she knows everything about this house, but, as you can see, she's not really much of a people person. I mean, I know some things about the house. I could take you on a tour. - That'd be great, sure. - All right. - Right now? - Yep. All right. I'm down. Which way? Follow me. And this is Keziah. She was a servant girl a long time ago. Why would they paint a servant? I don't know. But my aunt likes to come in here and talk to it for hours. I thought you said she was the sane one? (chuckles) She's talkin' to the painting? I don't know what she hears. Oh, but come check this out. Okay, so here's where Etta keeps all the historic paperwork. Why she hides it back here, I don't know. (switch clicks) Wow, that is so amazing. Do you mind if I look around? - Not at all. - Yay. - Just please be quiet. If she knew that we were up here, she'd kill us. Oh, of course. I'll be quiet, I promise. Hey, I'm gonna get some wine. Would you like some? Yeah, sure. That sounds good. All right, I'll be right back. All right. Thanks. - Have fun. - Oh, I will. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. I found some really interesting stuff. Check out these blueprints. And, and... Yeah, there's these old newspaper articles in there that have... I think it was a murder that actually happened here. Was I reading that right? And why wouldn't you tell me about this? I already told you that my Aunt Etta is into all that stuff. I think that you should check out this room with me across the hall. Okay. Yeah. (dramatic music) (moans) You're so...

This is called the Versiera, or Witches' Curve. And certain geometric shapes can magnify the potential energy of human thought, completely freeing us from the constraints (clears throat) of space time, and making it possible to be at any place or at any time. This is why extra-dimensional beings are so dangerous. There's almost nothing you can do against one. If you're very, very lucky, it won't notice you and accidentally kill you, and if you encountered a structure built by an extra-dimensional one... (ominous music) (demonic whispering) Alice? Alice. (students gasp) [Student] Is she okay? Yo. (students murmur) (Alice moans) What happened? What happened? (breathes heavily) Is she all right? Yeah, it's okay. I've got it, thank you. Thank you. I don't know what's happening to me. I feel... Like there's some spiritual force using me. I slip in and out of dreams. I woke up at home and thought I was here. Even this could be a dream. I don't even know what day it is. I... I know somebody and I think that he can help us, okay? We'll go. What seems to be the problem, Kelly? You seemed quiet upset when you called. Are you familiar with the Hannah house? There's a lot of stories surrounding that place. Why do you ask? Have you ever heard of Keziah Mason, by chance? It says here she was an immigrant servant girl for the Hannah family. You know, girls went missing. The local people accused her of using black magic to lure them into the house and kill them in the attic. (Keziah screams) So, she was burned at the stake. Soon after death, people found bones under the floorboards of the attic at the Hannah house. We still have an unusual number of children going missing to this day. She's more than a witch. She's a Versiera. A wife of the devil. My advice to you girls is to stay away from that house. You know, Alice, I think you really need to get out of that house. You know that's not gonna happen right now. I can't leave. Did you not hear anything that my friend was saying? Mm-hm, but I am this close to proving my theory, so... (sighs) Please listen to yourself. I mean, I'm sorry, but just yesterday, in class, you had the most epic meltdown and all of a sudden, today, you're this witch house detective and it kind of- - Shh. - Worries me. [Alice] Shh. I wanna hear this. [Reporter] From Hidden Pines City Park near Miskatonic University. She was wearing a orange jumpsuit with matching headband. Several search teams have been combing Carson County and surrounding woods. Police aren't saying if this is connected to any other recent missing children. Nine-year-old Josh Gibson is still missing... Wait. Did you hear that? That's the missing kids. That's what he was... That's what he was talking about. (Alice sighs) I didn't wanna tell you this, 'cause I didn't wanna worry you, and it's really messed up, but I had this realistic, like really real dream that there was a baby being sacrificed. What? Oh, my god. That's it. I'm gonna call the cops. Wait, no. Why? Like, seriously, what're they gonna do? You gonna tell them that "my friend had a bad dream"? Come on. It seems better than nothing at this point, with everything going on, I think... Alice, you need to get out of that damn attic. That's not gonna happen tonight, so, I'm gonna go in and get some sleep, I'm really tired. We'll talk about this later. Well, can you at least promise me that you'll think about it, about getting out? I promise, Kel. Goodnight. (ominous music) (cracking) (Kelly screams) (crunching) (brooding orchestral music) Commonly referred to as the Markt Kirche, or "the church on the market", this striking 14th century brick structure currently houses the Marktkirche Church in Hannover, Germany. Thanks to its large-scale flourishings of ancient symbolism, it was the subject of comments and many conspiracy theories, most commonly referred to as "the giant pentagram" on the church's western tower, and as if that weren't enough a giant hexagram surrounds that tower's clock. Of course, the truth of the matter is that five and six pointed stars have a long fluid history in Germany. First used by the Teutonic pagans and then adopted by the church at the time of construction. The pentagram in particular was the symbol of the epiphany. This church in particular, with its grand organ, is a striking example of Germany's rich gothic brick tradition.

(Alice groans) [Alice] My head. (moans) (groans) I think I might have actually proven my dissertation. What? Yeah. My research is correct. The geometry, it all adds up.
