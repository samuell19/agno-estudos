Take the luggage from the back please, won't you? Aye, miss, I will. All right, Davey, I'll see to it. Good evening. Dr. Mitchell. I hope you're better at diagnosing an illness than you are at recognizing a face. Martha, oh, forgive me. You weren't expected until next week. I exercised a woman's privilege: I changed my mind. Woman, indeed... and yet, three years ago... Was I really so awful three years ago? Well, you were very young. I know one thing, Martha. - You are very beautiful now. - Thank you. How is the doctor? Oh, he doesn't change. Brilliant, aggressive, provocative. Verbose as ever. But even he will be at a loss for words when he sees his favorite niece. Miracles, gentlemen, are an apology for ignorance, and a retreat for fools. You, men of medicine, are the modern miracle makers. To primitive man, the human body was a miracle. To us, it is a structure of some 260 bones, and attendant lens, muscles, blood vessels, nerves, organs, and tissues. A complicated structure, I grant you, but to us, no longer a miracle. And so today, some of you become doctors in your own right. Masters of anatomy. I congratulate you. You are entering the most honorable profession in the world. Sometimes too honorable. If half my colleagues pursued the study of disease as strenuously as the honor of knighthood, the country would be a damn sight healthier place to live in. But, let me warn you. Your studies do not end here. As long as you face the challenge of death, they never will end. Remember, also, that death is not only your enemy, it is your friend. Death is an incident-producing clay. Use it, mold it, learn from it. And finally, hearken to the words of Mr. Alexander Pope: "Know first thyself," presume not God to scan. "The proper study of mankind is man." Yes, gentlemen, man. Alive or dead. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, Jackson? - May I speak to you, sir. - Certainly. Thank you, sir. - Well? - I was hoping to have graduated - this time, sir. - Not more than I, Mr. Jackson. You'll tell me where I fail, won't you, sir? I try... I work harder than most. - I tried to please you. - Please me, indeed. Do you consider yourself harshly treated? - No, sir. - Unjustly? - No, sir, but... - I will diagnose the cause of your failure, Jackson... You are far too emotional. Emotion is a drug that dulls the intellect. You must learn to approach the science and medicine with a more clinical mind. Confine yourself to the abstract. When you are capable of doing that, then you will graduate with honors. - Yes, sir. - Jackson. - Sir? - Are you short of money? Well, sometimes it does get a bit difficult, sir... I asked for a statement, not a soliloquy. You could assist Davey to treat the subjects. - You know what to do? - Yes, sir. That'll put an extra guinea a month in your pocket. Thank you, sir, that's very generous of you, sir. Oh, Mitchell. Well, another 30 witch doctors let loose upon the unsuspecting populace. Good heavens. - Uncle. - Oh, dear child. Mitchell, we must write and thank Madam Decleaux - for this... this miracle. - I thought you - didn't believe in them. - Oh, I do now. From a gawky, long-leg schoolgirl to this. You look quite wonderful, my dear. A tribute to French cooking. - I'm proud of you. - Thank you. And I'm grateful to you for sending me to France. Mitchell, we must drink a toast to France. You're the man for a pretty speech. Oh, I can hardly compete with you, sir. Would you call my speeches pretty? Tell me, my dear, did you have a good journey? - Wonderful. - Comfortable? Excuse me, sir, there are two gentlemen here with a stiff. I beg your pardon. With a subject, sir. Thank you. Yes, sir. Attend to this, will you? And don't wait for me. And tell him all about the broken hearts you left behind you in Paris. Well, are you going to tell me? About the broken hearts I trust your interest is purely academic. No. Oh, it's wonderful to be home. I hope you're not gonna find Edinburgh dull after Paris. - Should I? - Oh, it needn't be. I can be the most romantic city in the world. Then it has secrets I'd never dreamed of. - It has. - And will you show me these secrets, Dr. Mitchell? Some of them. Nice and fresh, sir... Just a week in the grave. I'll give you five guineas. - Oh, but, sir... - Five, I said. Well, Doctor, seeing you're such a good customer. Where will you gentlemen be celebrating tonight? Well, I I go to The Merry Duke, sir. Take this on account. Jackson... Jackson! When my housekeeper returns, you'll get her to change this. Go down to the tavern and give them the balance. - Very good, Jackson. - Thank you kindly, sir. "Nice and fresh." You'd think the medical counsel could do something - about it, sir. - In what way? So that academies could be supplied legally with bodies. They could petition Parliament. Yes, Parliament... With 500 walking corpses there, you would think they could spare one. A member from Edinburgh would do nicely. Easy now, Jackson, we don't want it to fall apart on the ground. No, sir. Come on, my darling, come on, give me a little kiss now. You see them two, Willy? Oh, they call themselves resurrectionists. They supposedly think that that's a classic taunt of the professional way, Willy. It's disgusting, the place is going downhill when they serve the likes of them. Still, there's money in equality. Do you mean to tell me you have the upper hand in a broken down old corpse that's been in Europe for weeks for the sake of money? I'm surprised on ya. But the old woman keeps going on about money, Willy. Do you know what she was saying to me? She was saying I should look for work. - No. - Aye, it's as true - as I sit here.. - What? Are you a landlord as well? Excuse me. Good evening. One, two, three, four. Thank you, kindly. - Get your hands off me! - They weren't no dirties - until equality came in. - I have no changed since the day you were born, and a stinking minute! Don't let him near me, mister. Give the lady back her skirt. - Come and get it! - Watch him sir. Thank you, much obliged. If you stay a while, I'll buy you a drink. No, no, I'd better... Help! Police! Mugger! Help! Help! Police! Mugger! Come with me... quick, quick! Get in here! Get in here quick! This way... come on. Hey, Mary, where are ya going? Oh, do you have to call for them in the streets to get a fellow? No, well at least I can still get 'em sober, deary. Come on. - Hey, come on. - Hey, give me a glass. Come on. Here, get underneath the light. Let's have a look at you. It's not so bad... I'll soon fix that. Sit yourself down. - Thanks for your trouble. - Oh, it's the least I could do. You helped me... Bring that chair over will ya? Well, there's no need to make all this fuss. No fuss. Have you been here before? No, no, I haven't. You're one of the medical students, - aren't you? - How did you know? Oh, we get a lot of your type in here. Them, and art students. They come to understand the human form. That's anatomy, isn't it? Yes, but not quite as it's studied at the... academy. I could teach them more than they'll learn at college. Don't you think I could? - I think I'd better go. - Did those villains get your purse? - No, no, it's still here. - Good. - I'd better go. - Don't ya like me? Yes, I do. Stay a wee while. No, I... Lee-da-dee-dee la-dee-dee-dee. La-dee-da-dee la-dee-da-dum. La-dee-dum la-da- La-da-dee-da-dee I! A-ee. How's your head? Oh that? It's all right. When'll I see you again? Oh. I'm here. - All the time. - I mean, really see you. Take you out or something. Take me out? That's a good one. And what would your friends say if they saw you out with the likes of me? Don't laugh, Mary. When? Tomorrow maybe. Tomorrow. You better go. You're going to be late for your class. Good Lord, yes. Old Knox'll have me. All right, tomorrow. Tomorrow. Catch, Jamie. What a lovely rotting apple, Jamie. Save me some core, Mr. Hare. Did you hear that, Willy? Save him some core... Oh, it's a great sense the boy has, give him the rotten... There's one thing you gotta learn. It's a hard life for an injured fella. - Look, Mr. Burke. - What is it, Jenny? They told me to get you home, something terrible's happened. - Well, what is it? - You'll see it when you get home. Could it be that woman's broke her neck? Stop your wishful thinking, man. It's a grand clown you are, Willy. Good old John. - Just a handful of bones. - Aye, that he was. Aye, it's no wonder he passed out on us. Can ya hurry up and get him out now? I'll do what I can for ya. Aye, it makes the place look untidy. - Guess the news, Willy. - Surprise me. Old John's been and died on us. - No. - He must've passed away in the night without a word of warning. Ya hear that, Willy? The lodger's died owing me money... Three pounds it is! What kind of a man is it could do thing like that. Trust old John to take the easy way out. - How's business? - Very slack. I am away for some milk, Mrs. Burke. He'll be gone sooner than that dog can wag his tail. That'll be tomorrow... I don't know what the rest of my lodgers are gonna Say. Well, he's one less to worry about, that dirty old swindler. Oh, stop your moaning and go and put the bed-to-let sign out. - What's for dinner? - Kippers. Can make do with the ones we had yesterday, - they're still repeating on me. - If you're down a copper or two, you could've finned a haddock. Or there's one there in the cupboard - but I think it's gone off. - So how's poor Johnny? Ya know, Burke, I was thinking. It's a shame for Johnny to be going to a pauper's grave. And him with an unpaid debt on his dying conscience. Aye. Sure they put them things on very loose. - What are you up to? - Burke, could your missus go down to the pub and get a can of gin? And what do you think you're going to use for money? Stop your clacking, woman... Have you no respect for the dead? - Here. - You're not so generous when it comes to paying your share of the house. Here's your man here says be out with ya. Yeah. We could get six guineas for him up at the doctor's place and that would wipe out the debt. Aye, and besides, giving him his rightful chance to salvation. It's a great pleasure to be doing someone a kind service. If only he knew how happy he would be. And he got a mean outfit... No wonder he died owing me money. - Good evening. - Good evening, Doctor. "Out of this nettle rash danger, pluck this flower." Thank you, sir. - Thank you for the flowers. - I'm glad you like them. Why is he giving this party, Geoffrey? To launch you on Edinburgh society. Real reason? To collect his friends and enemies alike into one room, and then insult them all indiscriminately. I tell you, gentlemen, medicine is being driven underground. The law yields to us the body of a criminal when he is caught and hanged. When we have to wait a very long time for justice to unravel itself... Meanwhile, the resurrectionist - plies a very useful trade. - Oh, really, Knox? - You deny it? - Well, I agree you doctors need bodies for dissection, but to condone the violation of graves by these ghouls. I neither condone nor condemn... I accept. Is the feeding of worms more sacred - than the pursuit of truth? - I think the reverend feels that to violate the grave is to violate the soul. - I do. - Oh, really? I am told that when the body is clay, the soul has already flown one way or the other. Fortunately for the poor victims of these grave snatchers, that is true: Their soul has left the body. Of course... I was wondering why I'd never come across one - in my work. - Oh no, Robert... So you deny that the soul exists? I deny nothing. I can show you the heart, my dear reverend. Can you show me the soul? - It is there? - Where? Beneath the armpit? Between the eyes? - Deep in the abdomen? - The fact that you cannot see it does not prove its non-existence. After all, you can't see a thought. No, but you try having one without a brain. Gentlemen, gentlemen. The trouble with Knox is he's a teacher. Ho-ho, I'm old-fashioned. You can have too much of anatomy. For me, a surgeon needs two things: A patient disposition, and a pair of strong hands. Admirable qualifications for a laborer building the Caledonian Canal. I suggest you're wasting your talents, Dr. Ferguson. - I consider that an insult, sir. - I complimented your strength... Now, now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen. Elliot, is it true what I hear? They say no matter what the complaint, you have but one prescription: Cenapas. - That's a libel. - I know. A lawyer told me the story. Well you must sue him sometime... Excuse me. That man is doing the devil's work. Aye. He does it brilliantly. It's terrible creepy here, isn't it, Willy? Sh-sh-sh... I'd leave the talking to me. Sure, he's the perfect specimen, your honor... Burke, stand aside so the gentleman could see our gentleman. Died only a few hours ago, your honor. We heard you like them fresh, sir. This one's as fresh as a new-cut cabbage. Excellent. Excellent... I'll give you seven guineas. - Thank you kindly, your honor. - Is this your - normal line of business? - Well, it's Mr. Burke here. He's paid way of running a small lodging establishment, you see, and. I see. Put him in the brine, Davey. May the saints preserve your honor. And may his soul rest in peace. Amen. - This way. - Come on, Willy. Oh... How do you do, Ms. Knox? I'm well, thank you, Mr. Jackson. - How do you do? - Are you not going to - introduce me to your friends? - Yes. This is Mary Patterson. - Mary, this is Ms. Knox. - How do you do? - How do you do? - This is Dr. Mitchell. - One of our doctors. - Oh, you're one of them, are ya? How do you do? I'm very pleased to meet ya. - It's a lovely day. - Oh yes, yes, it is. Most unexpected for the time of the year. Well yeah, it's very much better than yesterday, don't ya think? Is that your boat? It's a punt, Mary. It looks nice. - I wish we had one, Chris. - Well, why don't you borrow it for the afternoon? You'd be very welcome. Oh, what, with Chris paddling, no fair. I don't fancy walking home with wet drawers. I think we'd better go, Mary. - Goodbye, Ms. Knox. - Goodbye, Mr. Jackson. Dr. Mitchell. Come on, Mary. Well. - She's very pretty, isn't she? - Yes, she's very pretty. - I feel sorry for Jackson. - Oh, why? Oh, he tries so hard, and he always fails. Well, it's not from lack of encouragement. The doctor's been very patient with him. He's been giving him extra coaching. But I'm afraid his mind's not on his work. Come to that, neither is mine. - What's the matter, Mary? - Well you're ashamed to introduce me to your friends. They're not exactly friends, and I wasn't ashamed. Well, you looked it! Look, Mary. I'm proud of you. You know that... I'm the proudest man in the world. Oh, you need a woman about the place. I need you. - Oh yes, Mary. - Oh no, wait till tonight. - Tonight, tonight. - Can't, I've gotta work tonight. Work? Tonight? I've got papers to prepare for tomorrow's lecture. I thought perhaps we could go out for a wee drink somewhere. - And then come back here. - No, I've... Don't work tonight, Chris. Not tonight. - Come on, Burke. - No. Burke, wake up, Burke. Sit up straight, man... The money's gone. - It's all gone. - Aye, not a farthing left. Well, what were you doing wasting half of it on the likes of her? Sure, Aggie is what they call a capital investment. - She's a what? - It's a thing the businessmen talk about. Poor old Aggie. Isn't she a sight to make your heart bleed? That's the drink that's took hold of her. Come on, Aggie, wake up, girl. You can't go sleeping here the night. - Give me a hand, Burke. - Well, what have you in mind? Well, the poor thing needs a decent bed. It's the least we can do for her. Come on, Aggie, go on with Mr. Burke here. The kindest landlord in the town. You know, Burke, there's no one here to see old Aggie go except us. 12 o'clock. All's well. 12 o'clock. All's well, 12 o'clock. All's well, - Drink. - What's she doing here? Mind your business. Hey, where am I? Oh, Aggie, you're among friends. Me and Burke here. Aggie, my dear, you're in no condition to be walking abroad now. Burke, give Aggie a drink of the whiskey. That's my girl. I can see the bloom coming back to your cheeks, all right. Helen, grab a seat and keep watch. - What for? - Do as Willy says, woman. Let us know if you see anyone coming. - Willy... - It won't take a second. Now, Burke, you wouldn't want to be turning old Aggie out with her feeling so weary. What are you up to, what? Now, Aggie, you're not thinking our intentions are dishonorable. You're old enough to be my own mother. Rest her soul. You're a couple of kind-hearted boys. There's no men as kind as the old folk these days, no. I'm awful sleepy. That's right, Aggie. You have a rest. Have a good rest. Do ya hear that, Burke? She wants a rest. Hardly a whisper. Sure the old girl's better off. She'd nowhere to go. That must be a terrible thing when you're old. She bit my hand, Willy. She bit it. Well, you can't blame her for that. Here. Put her in here. Fold her up nicely, Burke. Can't blame her for that. Filthy thing. The filthy rotten thing. Ain't she a beauty, Willy? Ain't she a beauty? Burke! Six, seven, eight. You say you found her dead drunk in the street? But fresh as a herring, your honor. And already pickled, as you might say. I prefer the subjects to be pickled externally. This one is liable to explode. However, her heart, I suppose. You're a great man to be doing business with, Doctor. Do you take the snuff? Would you be wanting a more or less regular supply of our foreign fortunes like Aggie? There's always a big demand for subjects here. Oh, isn't... isn't there hundreds just like her in this old town. Nowhere to sleep with the freezing cold. It's a wonder the whole place isn't littered with corpses. - Goodnight, Doctor. - Aye, goodnight to ya, Doctor. Probably the best thing for her, Davey? Aye. She was a fair age, sir. She'll serve a more useful purpose now than she did in life. See to her in the morning, will you? Aye, sir. Do you know what? A man could become a millionaire at this game. - Do you think so, Willy? - Weren't I telling ya? And you know, it gives a man pride, respect of himself to be doing a good job. Just think of it Willy: Burke and Hare, members of the great medical profession. I draw your attention to the protuberance of the frontal lobe. This gentleman might have been a useful citizen, but he was hanged some 20 years ago for murdering his entire family. Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson! - Yes, sir? - Will you be kind enough to step onto the platform? Yes, sir. Now, sir, will you please explain to us how modern surgery might've saved this man from the gallows? Yes, sir. - First... - Use the pointer, Mr. Jackson. We are waiting. Yes, sir. - First... - Please don't mumble, sir, and turn your head so the class can hear you. First, by removing the protuberance - on the frontal lobe... - Removing it? What are you proposing to do, scalp him? Quiet! I'm sorry, sir. You cannot enlighten us? No, sir. Were you not given a thesis to prepare on this subject, - Mr. Jackson? - Yes, sir, but you see... That will be all. Mr. Smithy. Proceed, Mr. Smithy. Modern surgery could've lifted part of the lobe approximately an eight of an inch, so that the pressure would be taken off the brain. Very good, continue please. Come all young men and maiden. Bow down to me. Come all young men and maiden. Gotta listen unto me. Well unto you do I unfold go and prove my destiny. What ya looking at me like that for? I was just looking. Cotton! Chris! Chris! Oh, Chris. Mary. It's all right. How you must hate me. No. Here. Where did you go? I went across the road for a wee drink, you know how it is. Yeah, I know how it is. - Chris? - Yeah? You know what you asked me to think about? About marrying me? Well? No, Chris. Couldn't I make you happy, Mary? You see the way I am. Half of me wants to be with you, and the other half keeps tugging the other way. I'm not a good girl for you Chris, I never was. I need to go out and laugh and have fun, and maybe have a drink too much, you know? I don't want to make you miserable. Look, Mary, I know it's dull for you, sitting about here, but I've got exams to pass. I'm going to be a doctor. Well, I know that. But I will try and take you out more. Honestly, I will. Will you, Chris? You promise me one thing, Mary. What? Stay away from that house. I'll try. - Really I will, I'll try, Chris. - Promise me. - I promise. - Good. And tomorrow night I'll take you out and set the town on... fire! Oh, Chris, oh, let's not talk about fire, Chris. It's the real aristocrat you are, Willy. That's the finest whiskey that I ever seen in my life. Suits the color of your eyes. - Bloodshot. - Keep a civil tongue - in your head, woman. - Is there nothing for me? - What do you want? - Oh, I saw the bed-to-let notice, and if the bed's still vacant... Oh, don't stand there in the draught. Come in. Don't worry, you're with friends. - Okay. - That's more than welcome ya are and that's for truth, Burke? Aye, that's the truth, as welcome as a golden gilly. Hey, would ya... would ya like a bite of something to sup... Helen, my darling, don't just stand there. Go and get the gentleman a plate of something. You're very kind. I'm a poor man, but I won't be any bother. Oh, sir, you'll be no bother at all. Have you been long in Edinburgh? No, I just arrived the day. I'm down from Inveraray. That's a wall up in the Highlands, you ken. Is it now? Did you hear that, Burke? The gentleman's come all the way down from the Highland. Aye. Will you be wanting the bed for long? Well, that's hard to say. I'm looking for work, you see. I see, tell me... Oh, do you take the snuff? How kind, thank you. Tell me, Mr. McLaren, Angus McLaren. We'll just call ya Angus. Tell me, Angus, have you... Have you got any friends in this town? No, I am just a crafter. And there are hard times by, so I just thought to myself, "It'd be nice to visit the capital" and make a decent sum of money, so as I can end my days - "in peace." - Isn't that what we all want? Just to end our days in peace. You've done business with us before, I gather? Oh, aye, sir, that we have. With Dr. Knox. The doctor is occupied at the moment. I'll attend to you myself. I am Dr. Mitchell. Well, open the box. Aye, sir. Would you believe that? This man died only a few hours ago. Oh, aye, that's right, doctor... you see, we got him quick before the parish undertaker could get his thieving hands on him. Where'd you get him? Well, you see, the poor old soul was lodging at my colleague's house. That's Mr. Burke here. And he seemed to take ill. Just old age... Passing away in the night. How did he get that bruise? Bruise? - Has he got a bruise? - Well, look for yourself, man. Oh. Do you see that, Burke? He's got a bruise on the side of his head. Isn't it amazing? You know, I... I'm glad you pointed that out, doctor... - I said, "Where did he get it?" - I don't think there's any need to cross-examine our friends, Dr. Mitchell. We've had several fine specimens from these gentlemen in the past. I was merely trying to establish the cause of death, sir. Don't tell me he was a patient of yours, Mitchell. Yes, I think eight guineas is the current market price, - is it not? - Eight guineas it is, sir. And as ever, sir, it's a pleasure to be doing business with a fine gentleman like yourself. Aye, that it is, Doctor. Show our friends out, and then lock up, will you, Davey? Goodnight, dear Doctor. Goodnight. Dr. Knox. Dr. Mitchell. Are you satisfied that subject died a natural death? Why do you ask? Those those two men. What do you know about them, sir? - I know nothing, and care less. - And you'll continue to accept subjects from them without question? I will continue to teach anatomy, using the best specimens available to turn out doctors who will replace quacks. Is there anything else? No, sir. Then goodnight, Mitchell. - Is Dr. Knox engaged? - We don't wish to be disturbed. - The doctor is busy now. - We'd like to see him on an urgent matter... Will you kindly tell him? Come in, gentlemen. This is a great honor. Four of England's leading surgeons. - Dear me. - I hope you still consider it an honor when you've heard the purpose of our visit. Nothing could change my opinion of you, gentlemen. Proceed. An article by Dr. Knox. Page 13, but pray don't trouble to find the place, Dr. Elliot, I have an excellent memory. "A few months ago, a man came to the Edinburgh Infirmary" with an aneurysm connected with one of the larger arteries of the neck, notwithstanding its obvious characteristics, even to the merest beginner, that it was an aneurysm. A certain... distinguished surgeon pronounced it to be an abscess. Accordingly, this celebrity, who was once an amateur member of the ring, and who prides himself, among other things, upon the strength of his hands and arms, without pretention to head, plunged his knife into what he believed to be an abscess, "and the patient died in a few seconds." Oh well, damned effrontery. - How dare you? - "Dare"? - Is that a challenge? - Why didn't you name the surgeon? Were you frightened of a lawsuit? Well, since we all know your name, - and your reputation. - You heard that, gentlemen. You surprise me, Dr. Ferguson... I would prefer - to remain anonymous. - I intend to sue you to the last penny in your possession. A most laudable enterprise. No doubt, your plea occupation over a rich harvest will inspire a more adequate excuse - for your next failure. - Why you... Why didn't you let him strike me? Or were you thinking it would've provided a more potent weapon in the law-courts than a mere wrangle over an undisputed fact. I see before me four white, angry baffled faces. Why, because I have written an article? Because I have accused one of you of murder? My friends, go ahead take me to the high courts! And in the words of your puppet, sue me for every penny I possess. A business-like venture. I wish you better success in the field of commerce than you have enjoyed in the scared task of our profession. Is that all you have to say? No! I'm aware that the path of truth was never strewn with roses. On every hand, one encounters a gray gauntlet of empty threats. To be condemned by ignorance is a complement to the knowledge. Group your miserable way to the law-courts if you dare! I will meet you on the steps with a torch light to scorch into your souls and leave them bare as a warning to your future victims. Now if you would be so good as to incline your heads slightly to the right, you will observe the door. Please use it. Why do you deliberately insult them? - Are you criticizing me? - No, not criticizing. I wouldn't be so presumptuous but I'm warning you, those doctors will harm you if they can. How can they harm me? By making capital out of the merest whisper of gossip. Such as? An association with men like Burke and Hare. And who will listen to them? Am I to be as scared of expressing the truth as they are at hearing it? I'll tell you, Mitchel, it will take more than a handful of quacks to shake me. I am producing surgeons who will fight for humanity, not destroy it. And in the process of doing that nothing, nothing will stand in my way. The individual is not important. And listen unto me. Why am I cheery. What we got is destiny. My mother died when I was young, what truth do I relate oh my father beat me tenderly... - Hey, what's the time? - What's it matter? Oh, I said I'd be home to meet Chris. - Chris. - Goodness. - Oh, Jamie. - Hello, Maggie. - I got a new line for you. - All right. Come on, what's your line, what's your line, Jamie? It goes like this, there are creepy and crawlers and six legged bogies and things that go bump in the neck... Oh, that's very good, Jamie. - Isn't that good? - Ey, it's good. Jamie. I give you a penny? If you can remember the rest of it. Oh, come on, let's go over to the house, Mary. Come on, there'll be free drinks over there. My mother died when I was young. - Another time! - Get outta here. Mary? Get your coat, Mary. Get out of here. If you want a scene I'll give it to you. You're drunk, Mary. Let me take you home. Oh, let me take you home. Did you hear that? I'm gonna take you home, he says! Go on, if you were half a man you'd drag me out of here by the roots of my hair. But you just try it and I'll kill you. Go home yourself, Chris Jackson, scratch away with your pen like a good boy for the doctor will be pleased with you in the morning. And don't keep a light burning for me 'cause I no be back. I'm not gonna be bored anymore by your mealy mouth talk. Come on. Come on, come. Come on. Chris! Chris. Chris! What is it now? Nothing. Give me your drink. Of course, my darling. I'm a poor fool to be grieving for the likes of him. Imagine me thinking I could make a man of a ninny. There's plenty more of that where we're going. And where will that be? Tanner's close, just the three of us. As cozy as three bugs in a rug. It's just around the corner. Just around the corner. Just around the corner! Just around the corner. Just around the corner! Just around the corner. Come on. Mary! What the heck, what the heck! La-da-dee-da-da-dum I gotta make my bed soon. Say I'm weary all about... Burke, where's your wife? She's gone to see her twin sister. You'll wait here. Why, Willy, what for? Because I'm telling you. Oh. Don't make the place untidy, Willy. We're together, Mary. Just the two of us. No. Leave me alone. I can give you money. No! Let go! No! No. No, no, no! Stop! No, no, please. No, no, please, no, no! No! No, no! No! No, no, no, no. No, no, no! No, please, please! Shut up, shut up! - Please! - Shut up! Hey, Willy, the old woman's coming. Well, let's get our... Hey. What's she doing here? She's dead. Did you touch her? Nobody touched her. Willy just killed her, that's all. Oh, that's all right. I don't want a thing like that in the house, - she'll get us a bad name. - Look, me and Willy has work - to do so go to bed, woman. - What and her lying there? Get rid of that first, just look at the mess she's made in my bed anyway. - She looks lovely, Willy. - Ey. You know, I'm thinking the good doctor should give us a bit more this time. Your enemy, it is your friend. Death is an incident producing clay. Oh, you're at work early, Mr. Jackson. Yes, Davey. This one's the best we've had so far. Doctor wants some drawings taken before we put her in the brine. No. That would be... Jackson. What is it then? What's the matter with you? Jackson! Burke and Hare. - Mr. Jackson. - Burke and Hare. What is the matter with Jackson? Ey, he was acting very strange. I can tell you why. - Well? - Burke and Hare has just brought in the body of a woman named Mary Patterson. She was Jackson's girl. You killed Mary Patterson. I never touched her, be off with yah. You killed her. Now get back to where you come from. You killed her! You and your cut-throat friends! You killed my Mary and took her to Dr. Knox! You killed... Well, Burke, that's one subject we won't be selling to Dr. Knox. Goodnight, Mr. Hare. Goodnight, dear sir. Come on, my darling. He'll be as sober as a judge in the morning. What's the matter with your friend? He's fine, we'll see you later, Jamie. I might as well come along with you. Can I give you a hand? - He doesn't look very well. - He's all right. He's had too much to drink that's all. I wish I could say the same for myself. Well. Here. Mr. Hare, you've given me a golden guinea. Here ye, here ye. Murder, murder in Westport. Murder most foul. If any in the name of the king have any information please... Christopher Jackson. - Are you quite sure, sir? - Quite. You say he was stabbed? Yes, sir, he was found in an alleyway early this morning. Do you know of any reason why somebody - should want to kill him? - None, he was a quite man, hard working, I don't know about his personal life. Do you, Dr. Mitchell? I can't think why anybody should want to kill him. Well, thank you, gentlemen. I don't think I need detain you any longer. Thank you, inspector. Why didn't you convey your suspicions to the police? - Did you want me to? - And why not? You know what I fear, sir. An opportunity for your enemies to destroy you. Your consideration for me is very touching, Mitchell. However, if you seriously think that Burke and Hare are responsible for Jackson's murder your duty as a citizen is obvious. Or if you'll really consider that the life of a street woman is more important than the advance of surgery than stand in the market square and scream murder to the mob. I was thinking only of Jackson, sir. Hey, come on! Did you see that, Wally? Ey, the good doctor coming away from the police station. Lot a good that will do the police. Hey, watch your skulkin' there for you daft loon. Did you get the drunk home safely? Ey. We got him home safely, Jamie. I just was asking, you see, I'd done a terrible sin. - What'd you done here? - I... I found a man in the alleyway, he was dead. And what was the wicked thing you did then, Jamie? I stole a ring off his finger. And then you know, I went to confession and the priest said I should take it to the police. Now what do you think about that? And did you take it to the police, Jamie? Not yet. You didn't, ey? Well, that's a wise boy you are, Jamie. Wise? Yeah, have you got it on you now? No. If you take my advice, you'll sell it. You see the police may get to thinking that it was you that killed the man. Now me and Mr. Burke here, we may be interested in buying it from you. Seeing as we're in the trading business. Would yah... would yah really? - Wouldn't we, Willy? - Ey, we would. Say, you run along and get it, Jamie. Shall I bring it here? No, bring it to the house tonight. Then we can all drink just to celebrate the transaction. There's no time like a night for talking business. Well, what do you think, Willy? I don't think he's half as daft as we thought he was. - Jamie. - Hello, Maggie. I've been searching everywhere for Mary, have you not seen her? No, Maggie. I haven't seen Mary for nigh and two days now. - I'm worry about her. - Worried? You were talking to Hare just now. Oh, I was... Oh, it's a secret, Maggie. Geoffrey. I have a confession to make. Oh? Today, I overheard some of the students discussing the doctor. They were saying terrible things, Geoffrey. They were saying that the doctor isn't particular how or where he procures bodies for dissection. This isn't true, is it, Geoffrey? Geoffrey. This isn't true? No, madam. No. Good evening, Mitchell. Can we discuss tomorrow's lecture? I trust you've received my notes. Yes, sir. Our subject is the heart. Don't worry. Hello, Mr. Burke. Hello, Mr. Hare. Hello, hello. Hello, Mr. Burke? Are you there? Hello, Mr. Burke? Are you there? Mr. Hare? It's me, Jamie. Mr. Burke, Mr. Burke, no! Helen, get outside, watch for anyone coming. Into the house, Willy. Get him out of here as quick as you can. What's the matter, Helen? - There's no more screaming. - Only the pigs. Get the box ready, Burke. Oh. And don't let's be forgetting the ring. That's what he'd come here for. Murder! Murder. Help, murder, murder! Help, they murdered Jamie! Who murdered Jamie, who? It was Burke and Hare! I'd seen them, I'd seen them! What's it say there? But I tell you it was murder and I saw it happen with my own eyes! Now just a minute, just a minute, lady. And it was poor Daft Jamie! Those witched cut-throat Burke and Hare were murdering! Will you calm yourself, lady? I can't make an accusation of murder against somebody without some proof of the fact. Well, you come by the house you might find the evidence you're wanting! What's happened to Jamie, inspector? - What's been going on? - No, no, no. No. Hold your hymns, there's no cause to be grieving yet. All right, Mrs. Burke, where are they? - What... what do you mean? - What do you think I mean? You can't come busting into to decent peoples homes like that. - Where's Daft Jamie? - I don't know. I never saw him, I swear it. I never saw him, I tell you! You're lying! They murdered Jamie and you saw it happen! - No, I didn't, that is not true. - And Mary Patterson, you dirty thief! It's not true I tell you! Stop it will you! Stop it you bisselneck, you oughtta...! Stop it you two, stop it will yah! They're dead! They're both dead! And if you want to find them go to the Academy of Dr. Knox. Dr. Knox, in a few minutes Burke and Hare will bring you another subject. I beg of you not to receive it. - And why not? - Because the police know it was murdered, a woman witnessed it. Is this what you mean? Yes. Was this young man well known? Everybody knew Daft Jamie. And a woman screamed murder yet our friends Burke and Hare were not undoubtedly perturbed when they brought him here. Because the know you have more to lose than they. They're relying on you to cover their traces. Are you accusing me of collusion with them? Dr. Knox, I don't know what to believe any longer. But I beg of you, for your own sake dispose of the body before... You were saying? It's too late. Open the door, Davey. My conscience is answerable only for me, Dr. Mitchell. Nothing is too late. I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor, but, I've received some information from this woman. I have already been informed, inspector. That's him, that's Jamie! Poor Jamie. It was delivered a few minutes ago by two men of the name of Burke and Hare. Have you examined the body? You interrupted my intention, inspector. Take a look now, Dr. Knox, if you'd please. Could you state the cause of death? Violence without any doubt. They've been murdering right under our noses. What's the law doing about it? Let's get after them ourselves. - Come on! - That's right! Willy, Willy, they're after you! They're coming towards the house! They're coming after the pair of you. Listen! What do we do, Willy? It's all up with us. They're close by. The warehouse, we can hang there. - What about me? - You stay here, woman! They'll turn and run at the sight - of your ugly face! - No, don't leave me! You coward, you just give up and go on! There's Helen Burke! They're away to the warehouse! They're away to the warehouse, come on, already now. What have I done? They're coming, Willy. Just shows you can never trust a woman. Come on! A board, Willy. Come on, over here! Heave, heave. Heave, heave, heave! Heave! All right! Get Burke! Get off me! There he is! Come out here. They got them both, they got them! They've arrested Burke and Hare. In the case of the Crown versus William Burke. Call the first witness for the prosecution. Call William Hare. William Hare! Silence in court. Place your hand on the bible. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? For that I do, you honor. Hare turns Kings evidence! He turns Kings evidence! Here ye. In the trial of the Crown versus William Burke, the verdict has been reached. Burke guilty! Dr. Knox no charge! Dr. Knox no charge. But why should that old scoundrel get away free as air? Not with the crime that was going on. Damn me, one of them deserves to live - and as for Hare... - They've never did and honest days work in their lives. At the very least, Knox should be put behind bars! He's as guilty as either of them! Now if anybody else has anything to say against Knox you better tell me now. Be seated please. Keep your seats. The subject of this morning's lecture, gentlemen is neurology. Get it over with! I wonder what he's thinking now! It's a curse on Dr. Knox, I'm thinking, Father. Do you know, he never paid us for the last subject we brought him? Now you must make an Act of Contrition, my son. That's none of my business, Father. But if he paid us for the subject like an honest man, I'd be standing here in a decent pair of trousers. Meeting the public as I am for the first time. Our God bless... Hang. There are no charges against you, Mr. Hare. You're free to go. But the mob, they'll be waiting for me. You can go out the back way. Will you send someone with me? All right. As far as the door. Not me eyes. Not me... not me eyes. - Come on out. - Come on! I could get the coach around the back for you, it would take a few minutes longer. And keep the Medical Council waiting, Davey? That would be unforgivable. Oh, I beg of you not to go out there. Geoffrey! Take care of her, Mitchell. - Off with your head! - Off with your head! Off with you head! Murderer! Murderer. Off with your head! Off with your head. He's indestructible. No he isn't indestructible, Geoffrey. With all the jackals snapping at his heels he's bound to fall. In a few minutes he faces the Medical Council doctors, who for years have tried to destroy him. And he hasn't got a friend who will raise a finger to help him. This is not a court of law, Dr. Knox. The Medical Council is concerned only with the honor of our profession. Have you nothing to say? Nothing. You are my judges, gentlemen. This is a heaven sent opportunity. Make the most of it. Mr. Chairmen, gentlemen. I don't think we require your presence, Dr. Mitchell. I feel there is something you ought to here, sir. Very well. Gentlemen, I haven't come here to defend Dr. Knox and I'm not going to plead for him. We have all traded in death. Bodies snatched from the grave. Bodies taken from coffins before they went into the grave. In all the years of your experience can you deny that doubt has ever entered you minds? - As to what, Dr. Mitchell? - As to the cause of death. This is a scandalous implication! It is not on that, it is an accusation! We are students of Hippocrates but some of us are hypocrites. Look into your hearts and seek the truth and then, then if you condemn Dr. Knox, ask yourselves whether or not you condemn each other. And the entire medical profession. Dr. Mitchell, I demand that you retract that statement! Mister, mister! Give us a hand there, mister? Give us a hand there. And what will you buy with it? Oh, just a few sweeties, that's all. I'm sorry, I haven't any money with me. If you want to come to my house I'll give you some there. No thank you. You might send me to Dr. Knox. Doctor? Davey. I can't tell you how glad I am to see you. I thought I'd never see you again. And why? Because of the mob, "Death to Dr. Knox" they've been shouting it all night. So you didn't expect me to return in one piece? Or perhaps as a subject for my dissecting table. I've only been walking, Martha. - All night? - All night. Excellent for the constitution. Most terrifying for the soul. - The soul? - Oh, yes. I admit its existence. We are not demigods now. As a child, I believed in God and the Devil. It took a child to show me what I am now. - I failed, Martha. - Oh, no. Yes, I've failed. Oh, I don't care what they say about me. I've listened to the screams of the mob and the howls of deprecation from the Medical Council. Blood lust and hatred. I bracket my colleagues with the rest. I despise them all. Every one? Until this morning, yes. But I've just heard the voice of conscience. From a small child I heard the truth. And what did the voice of conscience say? It said, "You are an ogre, Dr. Knox." You have killed humanity”. For the sake of humanity. For the sake of achievement, ambition, those bits of clay. Poor lumps of humanity that Burke and Hare brought in. I have to confess to you, Martha. They seemed so small in my scheme of things. But I knew how they died. They've reached their decision. You are exonerated. So. They've decided to let the world judge me. Very courageous of them. It is time for my lecture. I have never missed a lecture, Mitchell. No, sir. It will be quite a new experience talking to empty walls. At least they won't criticize me. Thank you, darling. Be seated, gentlemen. Before commencing this morning's lecture, let us consider the Oath of Hippocrates the sacred oath of our profession. I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgement. And never do harm to anyone.
