Don't go inside! Stop! Sergeant Sakurai! The past can be changed. It started with a walkie-talkie with no batteries. Please don't give up. Who are you? What I heard from that device that shouldn't work was a voice from the past. If you're really in 1997, then prevent the next murder. Catch the Killer. You're the only one who can do it! As an investigator of cold cases, I worked with Sergeant Oyama, an officer from the past, to solve a number of old cases. The only people who know about this unpredictable device. Discovered dead are myself... Murder attempt and Sergeant Sakurai, head of the Cold Case Investigation Unit. This is Mr. Oyama's walkie-talkie. Why do you have this? Remember what you said? If you could communicate with the past, you'd ask to protect those you love. It's better to regret doing something than to regret doing nothing. Aren't you curious about your own future? I don't need to know my future. I should have told him but I couldn't. That two months later on April 15th, he'd be killed at Tanihara Memorial Hospital. Mr. Oyama... Are you really Sergeant Oyama? Rookie... Why do you have this? Listen carefully. Don't go to Tanihara Memorial Hospital on April 15th. Oyama or your daughter? Choose one! We discovered who killed Sergeant Oyama, and were able to change his fate. Are you OK? An ambulance is coming! Thank you. My memory has changed. Sergeant Oyama is alive. "Police Academy Graduation”. On April 1, 2010, the day I became a police officer, Mr. Oyama and I had promised to meet. But he never showed up. Lieutenant Saegusa. Did someone murder him again? Nobody knew what happened to him. Sergeant Oyama is alive. We'll be able to meet someday. I'm sure of it. You can change the future if you don't give up. There's hope if you don't give up. "SIGNAL The Movie Cold Case Investigation Unit" “January 25, 2021". You've met with the Prime Minister more than anyone else. Did you know that, Mr. Mitani? People keep track of the strangest things. Job-wise, I'd rather keep a low profile. - "Munehisa Mitani Deputy Director," - Well, please tell him. "Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office" - I'm looking forward to next week. - Yes, sir. - Good-bye. We'll be playing the usual golf course next weekend. Yes, sir. Hey, what the... The vehicle driving on the Metropolitan Expressway was carrying Cabinet of Intelligence Deputy Director Munehisa Mitani. It lost control on a curve and crashed, - "Junki Aoki," - killing Mr. Mitani and his driver. "TMPD Criminal Investigation Bureau Chief" - killing Mr. Mitani and his driver. Awfully hectic, huh? It's about that recent car crash. The higher-ups are holding a press conference. Chief Aoki, we have the results from the lab. It matches the gas from the Nishi-Shinjuku terrorist attack. It was "Heron" Aoki... Regarding the car crash that killed Mr. Mitani of Cabinet Intelligence at 2 p.m. today in Minato City, TMPD will be handling this incident as murder, not an accident. We will investigate accordingly. Shin-Towa News. What is your rationale? We have reason to believe Mr. Mitani and his driver were killed by poison moments before the accident. Any details on the poison? It is still being analysed. It was Heron, right? Michiru Koizumi from Weekly Breath. We obtained drive recorder footage of the vehicle in front of Mr. Mitani's. The symptoms of the victims were the same as those of the 2001 Nishi-Shinjuku terrorist attack. It was Heron, wasn't it? Public security police said at the time that the terrorist group was eradicated and all the Heron was confiscated. Tell us, Chief Aoki! That is correct. We have reason to believe that the poison used in this case was the VA2 gas "Heron". Oh boy, he admitted it. There's going to be an uproar. Then this case is... Deadly Heron gas was used in the Nishi-Shinjuku terrorist attack. Killing a total of 21 people. But that case was closed, wasn't it? Yes. The terrorists were all arrested, - "Condemned terrorist" - and the leader, Amamiya, - "Ryuichi Amamiya at time of arrest.” - was sentenced to death and executed. Public security police announced that all the Heron had been seized. But now another similar incident has occurred. Does this suggest that the terrorist case wasn't really over? Perhaps some members of the terrorist group evaded arrest... - "Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department” - Chief Cabinet Secretary Itagaki is here. - "Shinjiro Itagaki Chief Cabinet Secretary” - As Chief Cabinet Secretary, do you know what my job is? It's protecting the lives, and assets of our citizens. Therefore I am obligated to remove anyone who might threaten them. I don't just mean criminals. Government officials and senior police officials who fail to produce results, are also on my list. I ask that you bring this situation under control and ease the public's fears. Aoki, what's our line of investigation? We'll re-investigate all parties involved in the Nishi-Shinjuku case, to determine where the Heron came from ASAP. We ask that Public Security fully cooperate. Understood. "Satoshi Yamazaki, TMPD Public Security Bureau Chief." We'll share our investigative reports. But we'd like you to tell us everything you find out as well. Aoki, I saw your press conference. You won't get a second chance. I'm aware of that. "Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Justice Kato dies in crash.” "Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense Nakamura dies in crash."” Both deaths were accidental... Yesterday's press conference jogged my memory. Let's look into these accidents. The first accident happened in November 2009. Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Justice Kato and his driver died. The car crashed into a sidewalk full of pedestrians. Six were injured, three died. Says here the victims included a grade-school child. Yes. The second accident happened two weeks later. The Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense also died in a car crash on her way to the ASEAN Summit. Seen in this light, both accidents involved top government officials, and were caused by the drivers' deaths. They do resemble Deputy Director Mitani's case. If they weren't really accidents, then they're unsolved cases. Saegusa could be on to something. No forensic records or autopsy reports left for either of these cases. It's all been disposed of. I did get a hold of one thing, though. A report by an officer who happened to witness the first accident. What the... It's all blacked out. Fishy, huh? All the important parts have been covered up. Who's the officer? Let's see... Sergeant Oyama of Jonan Precinct. Let me see! "Takeshi Oyama." "November 21, 2009." But you gave me this address! Come on, give me a break. Yes, you do that. Hey! Call an ambulance! Hey! You OK? You OK? Hana... My daughter... Your daughter? Where? Hey, hang in there! You OK? Hang in there! I'm here to help you! Quick, get an ambulance! There's no way it was an accident. I saw it with my own eyes! Mr. Kato and his driver were both unconscious before the crash. This was murder. Give it a rest, man. HQ deemed it an accident, so it is. You're okay with this? Civilians were Killed! What do you suggest we do? Investigate again, what else? Do over a case that HQ took over? A local precinct like us? Are you stupid? Go back to catching petty thieves. You really don't know when to stop, do you? "Higashi Kanto Hospital." Unfortunately, her mother was already dead by the time she arrived here. Hana suffered cardiac arrest and a brain contusion, but she's currently stable. However, she may never regain consciousness. What did Sergeant Oyama see? Sergeant Oyama, can you hear me? Sergeant Oyama, it's Saegusa. Sergeant Oyama, can you hear me? Lieutenant Saegusa. Lieutenant Saegusa, it's Oyama! How've you been? Good! We finally connected again. I didn't think it'd happen anymore. So you're OK, then. What do you mean? I'm perfectly fine. It's been nine years. Nine years? It's 2021 here. What year are you in? It's December 2009. You investigated a crash that killed a government official, right? Yes, recently, actually... A similar incident has occurred in 2021, and we were looking over past cases. Your report was the only remaining document and it was blacked out. What did you see, Sergeant? I saw the accident happen. But the driver and the other man were unconscious before the crash. Hey, could you tell me about the accident in your era? Deputy Director-General Mitani of Cabinet Intelligence was Killed. The killer used Heron, the gas used in the 2001 Nishi-Shinjuku terrorist case. So if Heron was used in this case as well... It means the killer strikes again 12 years later. So that's why we connected again. Right? Sergeant Oyama, what day is it over there? Another similar accident happens on the 5th. December 5th? That's in four days. Who's the victim? The Ministry of Defense's Naka... Sergeant? Sergeant Oyama, please respond! Lieutenant Saegusa? Lieutenant? Damn it! Mr. Oyama said that? Yes. If the cases are all connected, and he can arrest the culprit at the second incident, it might stop the Mitani case from happening. Sergeant Oyama sounded well. Good. However, I couldn't tell him that he's been missing since 2010. I'll continue looking into it. We can tell him when we know what really happened. You're right. Nakamura... Nakayama... Nakata... Hey you! What are you doing? Stop! Get away from the car! Police! Stop! Let go! Are you gonna sit there all day? They're examining that syringe you had, We'll know everything once we get the results. Because they ignored me. Ignored you? What do you mean by ignored? Come here. Public Security is here. Public Security? Why? Hey, what are you doing? Oyama! Let go! Hold on, what do you think you're doing? Hold on... Oyama, stop! He's all yours. You know who they are! "Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense attends ASEAN Summit.” It's changed. Saegusa. - Take a look. - Come with me. Look at this. The Mitani case still happened. So the culprit wasn't the same? I don't know. There's more. If the attack was prevented, a record of it should exist. But I can't find anything. Thanks for coming. No ID on him. Hold on! What do you mean it was an accident? A large amount of alcohol was detected from the remains. He fell into the river drunk. That's the conclusion. You saw that tattoo on his arm! He's the guy Public Security took away! So what? It wasn't a criminal case so they let him go. A few days later he dies accidentally. Not strange at all. It is strange! This is unacceptable. I'm going to Public Security. Give me a break, Oyama! We're dealing with Public Security. Keep this up and you'll cause us all trouble. Please just drop it. But this is my job! You lot go out and gather info! Yes, sir. Not you! Stay put. Mr. Ito. You used to work at Public Security, right? What do you want? You quit your job soon after Kato's accident, didn't you? So I thought you might know something. I have nothing to say to you. You were also in charge of the Nishi-Shinjuku terrorist case. The one where Heron was used. Please. Will you promise you'll never bother me again after this call? Of course. "Nishi-Shinjuku Terrorist Incident”. Lieutenant Saegusa, it's Oyama. Sergeant Oyama, it's Saegusa. Lieutenant Saegusa, Public Security is rotten. What happened? They took away the suspect I arrested and released him. So you did arrest him. But he was later found dead. His name was Shuhei Tachibana. He was a remaining member of the terrorist group. Lieutenant, but just now... A former Public Security detective told me something incredible. What I'm about to say is all hypothetical. What if... right before Kato's accident happened, Public Security had received a letter from a remaining terrorist member threatening to strike again? It demanded... the release of Amamiya and the other terrorists involved in the 2001 incident or else they'll use Heron again in another attack. But Public Security concluded that it was merely a prank and ignored it. Because they ignored me. Are you saying Kato's accident was a terrorist attack? I told you, this is hypothetical. Right. Let's say... Let's say a suspect was caught, and Public Security let him go. But then, he was found dead. That man was probably inconvenient for the Public Security Bureau so he was eliminated. Eliminated? By Public Security? Who in the Bureau could do such a thing? Commissioner Yamazaki. Commissioner Yamazaki? The current Chief of Public Security. A gag order was later issued within the Bureau. What's more, the government also knew. The government knew about it? Sergeant Oyama, Yamazaki and Mitani were in charge of the Nishi-Shinjuku incident. They declared the case closed, so the truth would destroy their reputations. Maybe this all happened for their self-protection. If that's true, I can't forgive them. Civilians were involved and killed! There must be something behind this Nishi-Shinjuku terrorist case. Please look into it. Understood. Senior Commissioner Yamazaki! I'm Saegusa, Cold Case Unit. Sorry to bother you. May we speak? Do you have an appointment? No, it's an urgent matter. Make an appointment. It's about the accident that killed Mr. Kato back in 2009. May I have a minute? Only a minute. Come in. Make it quick. The car accident that killed Mr. Kato was actually a terrorist attack by a man using Heron, correct? We'd have arrested him if that were the case. Sergeant Oyama of Jonan Precinct did. I heard that this suspect was later handed over to your team, sir. I wonder what happened to him after that? Where did you hear this nonsense? I know nothing about that officer or the man he supposedly apprehended. No sir, it's not nonsense. Is this Detective Oyama's testimony? Then why not bring him here? What, you can't do it? Then this conversation is over. 15 seconds too long. Sorry to bother you. Is he out of his mind? The entire Criminal Investigation Bureau is in hot water, not just you! - I know. - No, you don't! Make sure he understands! I get how you feel, but it was rash. Public Security officially complained. I'm sorry. If what Mr. Oyama said is true, then that means the culprits of the 2009 case and this one aren't the same. So the Mitani case could have been carried out by... ...some terrorist group members from 2001 that are still at large? "Ryuichi Amamiya: Notes of a Condemned Terrorist Leader." "Michiru Koizumi." "Mikino Shuppan Publishing" Michiru Koizumi, right? TMPD, Cold Case Investigation. I'll tell you right off the bat that I don't really trust the police. But I'm willing to answer questions depending on what's in it for me. Very well. Saegusa. So, which incident? The Nishi-Shinjuku attack? No, a car accident that happened 12 years ago. In 2009? Heron might have been used in that case. You know something. No... Now it's your turn. A long time ago, Amamiya told me something similar right before he was executed. But I couldn't find evidence, so he probably made it up. But you don't really believe that. Right? Amamiya said, "There's actually a subordinate who is still on the loose,” "and he conducted a terrorist attack to set us free" "by using leftover Heron." In 2009. Are there any other members at large? He said that was the only one. There are no more. And... And? There's no more Heron, either. My Heron is perfect. No one can replicate it. Many people wanted to know how, but I never told anyone. So you don't have to worry. In the future, Heron will never be used again. The only remaining batch is the one the government seized. The government still has some? If what Amamiya said is true. Thank you, Ms. Koizumi. My pleasure, I heard some good stuff. Good-bye, then. So you're OK with it? I might publish this if you don't make me promise not to. It's rude not to trust someone if I want them to trust me. You're a strange cop. After the Nishi-Shinjuku incident, the government founded a chemical weapons section in the National Research Institute in 2010. That's where the Heron might be. The Research Institute... "Rika Anzai, Associate Professor" - And if it is there, it would be tightly guarded. - And if it is there, it would be tightly guarded. - "Keimei University School of Medicine". So making off with it... ...Would be impossible. But... what about an insider? Kazuo Yoshikawa, age 42. In charge of chemical analysis. His body was found hanging in the woods in Saitama. Prefectural Police declared it a suicide. The date of death... January 28th? 3 days after the Mitani case! Isn't that a bit too close? We need to investigate Yoshikawa. Hand over all the investigative reports from then. There must be some we still don't have. All right. Did you order a guy named Saegusa in Cold Case to investigate something? What are you talking about? Oh, nothing. Forget it. Yoshikawa was a serious guy and had a good reputation. But he wasn't spotless. A secret underage prostitution club was exposed and his name was on the list. His case was dismissed, but... He could have been blackmailed. And now we cut to the chase. This outwardly "serious" guy left work early for no reason a month before he died. Twice. Do we know where he went? Checked the plate recognition system. He went to Okamachi Parking Area both times. Was there for 30 minutes. Let's check out that parking area. What? Saegusa? Come in. Excuse me. So you're Saegusa. I heard you're investigating the Mitani case independently. I'm sorry for not reporting to you sooner. Don't worry about that. More importantly, tell me what you think about this case. The Research Institute? Yes. A researcher named Yoshikawa. He died 3 days after the crash. Hard to believe it's coincidental. We think the truth about his death will take us to Mr. Mitani's killer. I see. It makes sense. Also, Chief Aoki... What? Nothing. It's still conjecture. Saegusa. Do you remember your oath of service? "I solemnly pledge” "to carry out my police duties” "obsessing over nothing," "fearing nothing," "hating nothing, following only my conscience," "and with neutrality, impartiality, and fairness." I believe that this is what the police should be like. So if you think something is just, then don't be reserved. I suspect the culprit is a police insider. I see. I'll keep that in mind. Sorry, but I have a meeting now. Excuse me, sir. How many are there? It'll take more than a day or two to check all of them. We'll check them all no matter how long it takes. Sergeant Sakurai. "I'll tell you the truth of the matter that I couldn't share before." "Meet me at Harumi Warehouse No. 9 today at 7 p.m." "- Yamazaki." We can handle this. Go now. Yes. Chief Yamazaki. Chief! Don't move! Hands on your head. OK, OK! I'll approach you slowly. No, don't go! It's Heron. Found a syringe in his car! Get him! Hold on! I'm Saegusa from the TMPD. Chief Yamazaki told me to meet him here! We'll hear you out later. Saegusa, what's going on? I don't know! Some huge force is at work, it seems. Just please get to the bottom of Yoshikawa's death. I'm sure you'll find something. Are you OK? I'll manage. But I need to ask you a favor... What are you doing? Stop! Lieutenant Saegusa, it's Oyama. Lieutenant Saegusa, please respond. Mr. Oyama... Sergeant Oyama, it's Sakurai. Sakurai? Rookie? It's been so long. Yeah, it's been a while. Catch a cold or something? I heard you lead the Cold Case Unit. That's right. Hard to believe, right? Are you managing OK? Yes. That means you're Lieutenant Saegusa's boss. Oh, where is he? Actually, he's in serious trouble right now. Serious trouble? Why didn't you say that first? Tell me what happened. Public Security's Chief Yamazaki was murdered with Heron. Saegusa was framed as the killer and is on the run. The killer? What on earth happened? There's something Saegusa wanted me to relay to you. Look for someone who needed Mitani and Yamazaki dead in your era as well. That's the person who framed Saegusa. The person who had to kill both, huh? Understood. And Mr. Oyama... You be extra careful, too. Hey, Rookie! Mr. Oyama... Chief, look at this! This is Yoshikawa, right? - He's handing something over! - Is there another angle? Cameras No. 21 and 34. 21 and 34! They're verifying the contents. It that Heron? Who is it? In an update on the murder of the Public Security Bureau's Chief Yamazaki, the TMPD have announced that. Heron was detected in the victim's system. Chief Yamazaki of TMPD's Public Security Bureau was found dead last night and a male suspect fled the scene. Police have announced that a syringe was found in the man's car. Analysis of the content... Sorry to cause you trouble. I'll be fine. But you... My colleagues are looking for evidence. Once they find something... I was in first grade in that photo. I still remember clearly. There was a Christmas event at Shinjuku Central Park. It was really sunny, and a holiday, so there were lots of people. This was... the last photo we took together. 30 minutes later, the Nishi-Shinjuku terrorist attack happened. So many people who were there became victims in that incident. My family, also. I begged my parents to take me there. And... I was the only one who survived. "If only I could change the past.” I thought so many times. But that's impossible. So I became a journalist. At least I can try to find out why such an attack happened. That was something I could start doing now. I also lost my older brother in an incident. In my case, a certain cop found out what really happened. That's why... I became a cop, to be like him. So we had something in common. Maybe that's why. I felt like I could trust you for some reason. Me too. Wait. Use this smartphone. Thanks. Go! Get him! "Michiru Koizumi." Sorry. Get in! It's my fault. It's my fault Michiru was... Yoshikawa met with this person at Okamachi Parking Area. Sakurai, it's me. Hey, Rookie. Sergeant Oyama, it's Saegusa. Lieutenant Saegusa! Are you OK? I'm OK. Sergeant Sakurai is with me. That's good. Glad to hear it. Oh, about what Sakurai asked me to look into. I found out a lot. I kept my eye on Yamazaki after that. And lo and behold... Someone unbelievable showed up. Chief Cabinet Secretary Itagaki? All three handled the 2001 attack. They must have stayed in contact. By the way, wasn't there an officer who lost family in that accident? Aoki of Criminal Investigation. He joined the same year as you, right? Yes. I hear he lost his wife, and his daughter is comatosed. I'm sorry to hear that. Then we really mustn't let him find out about that matter. The girl I saved after Kato's car crash was Mr. Aoki's daughter. This watch... Chief Aoki has the same one. That can't be... Sergeant Oyama. Everything is connected now. The one who used Heron to kill Mitani and Yamazaki was Chief Aoki. Chief Aoki probably believed that it was an accident at first. But when he learned that it actually wasn't, he directed his anger towards Mitani and Yamazaki who covered it up. Those men... put their own power and safety above the lives of others. I honestly... can't help but sympathize with Mr. Aoki. Sergeant Oyama, Chief Aoki probably isn't done yet. Chief Cabinet Secretary Itagaki is left. I'll handle it. I'll try to talk Mr. Aoki out of it. Hold on, how do you plan on talking him out of it? Well... Will you tell him the whole truth? If he learns the truth, he might just act faster and cause even more deaths. But... Sergeant Oyama? But even so, I can't just sit around doing nothing! I just can't! No, Mr. Oyama! Lieutenant... Mr. Oyama! Damn it! Sakurai here. Chief Aoki has disappeared. His subordinates can't get a hold of him. Saegusa, Chief Aoki is going to strike. He could have already killed ltagaki if he wanted to. There must be a reason he hasn't yet. It must be this! "Party presidential election candidacy kickoff rally" The media will gather at this event tomorrow. Aoki is going to kill Itagaki there and reveal their crimes. That must be his intent. Good morning. I'm Sakurai, TMPD Cold Case Unit. Cold Case Unit? While reinvestigating a past terrorist incident, we've reached the conclusion that you might be their next target. We request that you cancel your rally. We haven't received any such info. Excuse me. It was no coincidence that Mitani and Yamazaki were killed. Considering your relationship with them, you get why you'd be next, don't you? I have no idea why. Are you done now? I have a party to attend. Then will you at least allow us to join your security team? Be my guest. Thank you. "Higashi Kanto Hospital." Excuse me. Are you the man who saved my daughter? No. Mr. ltagaki, it's been so long! Congratulations, sir. Nothing unusual in the ballroom. Tight security. "Shinjiro ltagaki - Party presidential election candidacy rally." The entrance seems fine, too. Not even an ant could slip in. The lobby is fine, too. The service entrance is... Notice something, Mr. Kojima? Some construction workers have overstayed 3 hours. 3 of them in the basement floor storage room. I'm on my way there. Yamada, you go too. I can handle this room. OK. Mr. Itagaki will now give us a few words about his vision as a candidate in the party presidential election. Please give him a big round of applause. Thank you all for taking time out from your busy schedules to come today. I appreciate your holding such a fine gathering to mark my candidacy as the next leader of our party. Mr. Yamada. The storage room is that way. I intend to become the next prime minister! Elevator's not working! Ms. Sakurai, elevator's down. Any changes over there? It's to protect. Protect the lives, the assets, and the health of our citizens. People's working conditions. Lifestyles. The future of our children. The golden years of the elderly. Protecting all of these is my mission... All the doors are locked. What's going on? The control room is in the back. That's it. - Follow me. - Thanks. This way. Police! You're safe now. Are you OK? I'll cut this. Three men came in... When was this? About an hour ago. They worked on the system for a while they left five minutes ago. Can you unlock the doors of the ballroom on the 27th floor? - Right away. - Thanks. What's that? The piping diagram of the sprinklers. To extinguish fires quickly, the pipes are usually filled with water, but... The water's gone and the upper floor pipes are empty? What's their aim? To cause a fire or something? What's that? The sub tank. It takes longer to draw water from the basement tank for the upper floors, so there's another tank in between. The sub tank... Sprinklers... Ms. Sakurai, can you hear me? I know what they're up to. They're going to toss Heron into the sub tank and shower the ballroom. Everyone in this room is at risk? My plan is all set to go! I can't. Program's been overridden. - What the hell? - May I? 16-digit encryption key? This would take even our cyber unit an hour to decipher. The sub tank's accessible from the 20th floor? Yes, it is. I'll head to the 20th floor. They're probably getting the Heron ready. You two stay and restore the system, please. Understood. I promise you that I'll do my best to help Japan develop and flourish as a strong and pivotal nation that leads Asia, nay, the world, even more so than we have in the past. That is my message as presidential candidate. Thank you for your attention. Shinjiro Itagaki will work to protect our present and future, and to revitalize Japan. We ask for your cooperation and support in the upcoming election. Too bad. Son of a...! I'll do the rest. Is it true? Terrorists? Please calm down and listen. I asked you if terrorists are really trying to kill me! I'm Sakurai, TMPD Cold Case Investigation Unit. Everyone please calm down and listen. What Mr. Itagaki said is true. This ballroom is currently under attack by terrorists. But our officers are doing everything they can to stop them. The hotel's systems should be restored shortly. So please, please don't panic and wait calmly! What you said better be true. I demand that you keep me informed! Situation under control. Situation under control! Good work. I'll wrap things up here. Hold on... Look! Oh no, the water is flowing. Remote control! Someone is opening the valve from the outside! What's going on? Damn, I can't stop it! No doubt about it. The hacker's IP address is inside this hotel. The remote control must be in the building. It's Aoki. He must be somewhere in the hotel. It stopped? Mr. Aoki? Attention please. Right now I hold your lives in my hands. Look at the ceiling. When I press this switch, Heron will shower down on you from the sprinklers above. Which room is this? All because of Chief Cabinet Secretary ltagaki's actions. He declared a terrorist incident as resolved when it really wasn't, and lied that the Heron had been destroyed. As a result, innocent lives were lost. Impossible! This is ridiculous. The fact that I now have the Heron that shouldn't exist is the ultimate proof. This hotel has a wedding hall, right? Sure, these places usually do. What about a chapel? On the 25th floor! It's a pipe organ. He's in the chapel! I'm on my way. Even worse, the police force that should be protecting citizens has become an organization that curries favor with rotten politicians. So I... have decided to punish them by my own hands. I'm almost at the chapel. Mr. Kojima, I need a favor. What? So now, everyone, prepare to die together with him. Can't you people at least save me? Sir, you can't be serious. Dead serious. Who will protect this country if I die? You used the police and government for nefarious purposes! Mitani was the one who suggested the coverup and Yamazaki did the dirty work. He was the one who killed that terrorist Tachibana and a cop named Oyama. I've done nothing wrong. How dare you! Chief Aoki, it's over. Saegusa, was it? Sorry for framing you as Yamazaki's killer. So you really were the one who killed Mitani. That's right. Killing me won't change anything. Neither will killing Itagaki. Even if you do that, another "ltagaki" will just emerge again. That's how organizations work. Don't bother lecturing me. I know. That's why. I won't kill him by ordinary means. Yamazaki and I joined the same year. He was a competent man. Hand that over. What you're doing is wrong. You understand nothing. No, I understand clearly. I know that a terrorist attack killed your family. Yamazaki, why did you lie? Why? Did they order you to? Say something, Yamazaki! You're Aoki, right? It's a shame about your family, but you need to understand. This was for the good of the nation. If announcing the truth and needlessly scaring the public is justice, then anyone could do it. Sometimes it's better not to know. We're the ones making those decisions. You have no right to criticize us. Get out. 7:27 a.m. I'm sorry for your loss. Saegusa. This is the only way to change the police at this point. Today's incident will be imprinted upon everyone's memories for years to come. This will be the police's biggest failure yet, and at the same time, it will serve as a warning that it must never collude with the government again. If that's accomplished, then my wife and daughter's deaths won't be for nothing. Please get a hold of yourself, Chief Aoki. The future will change if you don't give up. I believe it! A long time ago someone told me the same thing. Did you meet him? Sergeant Oyama. Oyama? The man who saved your daughter. Sergeant Oyama. Excuse me. Are you the man who saved my daughter? No. "Get well soon! You can change the future if you don't give up!" I wanted to thank him. Until my daughter died, those words helped me so much. Don't give up. Chief Aoki. It's not too late. Please. Give me the switch. I... can't let my family's death be for nothing. No! Why? Sergeant Sakurai? We're all OK. Understood. Itagaki is alive. We opened the valve on the 26th floor right below them. Mr. Kojima, I need a favor. What? Everyone else listen up, too. Aoki has control over the sub tank and the valve on the 27th floor. Since we can't control that, open the valve on the 26th floor and change the water's route. OK, I'll try. Give me the switch. Almost there... I... can't let my family's death be for nothing. No! Yes! We made it on time... You all can relax now. We've captured the culprit. You're under arrest for attempted murder. Suspect coming through! Mr. Itagaki. Don't think it's over for you. Saegusa. I know. This is our job. But I refuse to accept it. You did well. But this case isn't over yet. The future could change for Mr. Oyama and us all. If you don't give up, the future will change. Lieutenant Saegusa, it's Oyama. Lieutenant Saegusa. Sergeant Oyama, it's Saegusa. Aoki tried to use a terrorist attack to murder ltagaki. But... we managed to prevent it. I see. What about Mr. Aoki? We arrested him. But... the message you left had resonated with him. Lieutenant Saegusa. No matter who you may be, do something bad and you'll be punished. It's so simple. When will we ever see the kind of society where that's a given? I don't know. Still... we have to keep going. Of course. I'll never give up. I'll do what I can in this era. And one more thing. I must tell you something important. It's.. About your future. On April 1st, 2010, the day I become a policeman, Yamazaki of Public Security will murder you. "April 1, 2010." Congratulations. Thank you. Chief, here's Suzuki's interrogation report. I'll post it now. Talk to you later. My memory has changed. Sergeant Oyama is alive! "Commissioner Yamazaki arrested for attempted murder of police sergeant”. "Chief Cabinet Secretary Itagaki resigns over alleged police collusion”. "Chief of Police Aoki holds inaugural press conference." "I want to be interviewed by such a beauty, too." "Michiru Koizumi - First woman to receive award" - Your work was inspiring. Tell us about your plans for the future. The hardest thing for the family of victims is that they can't turn back the time. But by learning the truth about what actually happened, the time they can't turn back can be filled in just a little bit. That's my belief. I plan to keep working as a journalist with that in mind. Hey, Saegusa. - Good morning. - We were discussing our next case. What do you think? I think we should reopen this disappearance case. Good morning. Yamada, I'm taking Saegusa to ask around about a curious case. Come on, Saegusa. What curious case? Now I'm curious about that! Ms. Sakurai, Mr. Oyama is alive. My memory... I've verified it. He's at Shimogawara Precinct. It all began with a walkie-talkie with no batteries. The device that shouldn't work connected me to the past. My partner on the other end taught me that as long as you never give up, a bright future awaits you. Today, I finally get to meet my partner in person. Changing the past doesn't guarantee a bright future. Sergeant Oyama! But my partner chose to change it without ever giving up. He believed that a bright future lay beyond his actions. So I'll never give up, either. If you don't give up, the future will change. If you don't give up, there's always hope.
