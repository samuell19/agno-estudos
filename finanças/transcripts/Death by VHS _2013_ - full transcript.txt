You told me to come back Wednesday. Well, it's Wednesday. Did you get your hands on it, Man? Yes, I found it, Man. I'm sure you are first man after all you show life in your asses. Okay then, $50 a day and ten bucks for six days. They say it's like a drug, a drug you watch. Yes. Okay, follow me. This shit make you trip balls or what man? So the story goes, Man. Now get going, hit that highway. I've got a dude coming soon for his daily pick of a weed and if he sees you two here he's likely to go out and join the rehab. Now get going. What the hell happened with the fucking thing? It looks like it went through some kind of a war. It looks like somebody took a shit on it. Pick a number Babe - 28, 70, 19, 36. That One. 36 it is Kitten, guess my number is here. I wonder how many of these scenes were made. Ingrid? Yes. Ms. Mary. I can't go on that blind date you set me up with, Ingrid. Look at me, I'm a freak, hideous, it will never work out. Will you stop with the pity party. Just be yourself, it's what's inside that counts anyway. Andy's going to be here any minute. No, Ingrid, I can't go through with it. Guys always make fun of me. They call me names like She Freak and monster face. I mean why should this guy be any different. But he will be different, you never know, have faith. If you feel beautiful, you'll look beautiful so give it a shot. You can do it, I know you can. I wish it was that simple, Ingrid. Maybe some other time. Why does everything have to be such a tragedy with you, Mary? You're never going to find Mr. Right if all you do all day is sit around and stare at your fucking feet. Oh my God, do you think I like feeling this way and looking like this? You have no idea what it's like, you're normal. Go away asshole. Fine, I'm leaving. You're probably an ugly bitch anyway. So what are you doing today? Honestly, I think I'm just going to stay home and sleep all day. I mean what's the point of doing anything? I can't go anywhere without being called a freak. All of this doom and gloom life is what you make it. I made you some tea. I know you're trying to make me feel better. At least somebody in this world still cares about me. Mary, I love you, and I just want to see you be happy. Who is it? Hi, I have a delivery here Mary Cooper. Oh my God, my beauty supplies have arrived. I can't let him see me like this. Could you please sign for it for me? Mary, this has got to stop. Go to the door and get your package. Hello? Coming. Come in. How are you doing? I've got this delivery here for you. So you've got to sign here if you could, there you go. Thanks a lot. Have a great day. What did you get? What's in the box? This is the beauty elixir I ordered online. Beauty elixir? That sounds like some pretty weird shit. Where did you hear about it? I read about it on the internet. It's supposed to be over a hundred years old and it's really supposed to work. Give it to me. Drink deep this ancient meed and with these words you must heed for beauty and grace forever more. Drink the life of sweet amor. Honestly Mary this is some pretty fucked up shit. Where did it come from? House of Secrets Black Magic Supplies and Spells. Oh stop worrying, Ingrid, I'm not going to die or anything, all right? You know what? I live in the real world, Mary. I need to take a shower and I need to get ready for work and if you want to fuck around with your black magic and your witchcraft and your spells that's your business, okay? Hey Mary, I'm home, come talk to me. Whoa, Mary is that you? Yes, it's me. Look at me, Ingrid, I'm beautiful. How? The potion, it works. I can't believe this. Mary you're beautiful. Hey, can I set you up with a total hotty now? Ingrid, you can set me up with a million hotties. I've got a lifetime to catch up on. Well girlfriend, it's your lucky day, I know just the guy to call. Hi, come in. Hi there, how are you? Well these are for you. I just don't know if Ingrid told you but I'm actually her friend, Tony. Your name's Mary, right? Yes it is. How do you do? So are we going out somewhere? Yes, of course. Actually I have reservations at this Italian restaurant down the street. You have to book a month in advance over there. A month... Really? Yes, actually 20 minutes, we've got to get going. I actually met a guy down there, he actually owes me a favor. He had a cancellation so he did me a favor so come on, let's go. Come on. Shit. What's wrong? The fucking car won't start, I don't know what's wrong. Come on. I think I'm going to be sick. Ingrid, you are Mary's roommate? Now have you seen or notice anything strange about Mary recently? Detective, please, you've got to help me find her. I love her. Mary is my best friend. I'm really worried about her. Ma'am, just answer the question... Have you seen or noticed anything strange about her? Well there's this beauty potion. Beauty potion? Yes, Mary ordered this bizarre beauty potion online on some witchcraft magic shop site. The odd thing is it actually worked. What do you mean it worked? I mean it changed her, it made her beautiful. Back up, I'm a little bit lost. You're saying she's beautiful now? Look, Mary is... She's disfigured. She drank this potion and it changed her, it made her beautiful. Look, shouldn't you and your team be going around trying to find her, CSI shit, I don't know, something... Ma'am we're doing everything we can. Now if you hear or see her give me a call. Okay. And do you have a place to stay tonight? Yes, I'm staying with my brother. Hello? Ingrid, Detective Lou from homicide. Hi, Detective. Have you heard anything about Mary yet? No, no I haven't. I haven't seen Mary but I'm afraid every night... Yes, I'm afraid but all we can do... I'm really worried about her. If you hear anything just give us a call, okay? Yes, okay, you'll be the first one I call. Hello? Ingrid, it's me, Mary. Mary is that you? Please help me. Are you okay? Where are you? Come to me, Ingrid, please, come to me. I'll be right down, hold on, stay right there. Mary? Mary? Mary? Mary? Mary? Mary, there you are, I've been looking all over for you. Are you okay? Is everything all right? Your face? What about it? Did the potion wear off? Not exactly. Do you remember what the note said on the bottle? Drink deep this ancient meed and with these words you must heed for beauty and grace forever more. Drink the life of sweet amor. You smell pretty sweet. Mary, what are you doing? Mary. Let's watch another one, Babe. Do you feel weird? Let's just watch another one, please, just one more. This is John Tester at KLXA, the radio station, news broadcast. This is going to sound absolutely incredible. You have to believe me, stay inside if you are... I can hear them... Stay inside, if you're inside please do not go out. They're eating people. Eating people and then I know this is going to sound insane... I can't believe I'm saying this myself... But they're... Oh God... The dead have come back to life, I swear to God the dead have come to life and they are eating us. I am the only one here, I am John Tester at the radio station. I am the only one left. It's gone. It's gone. It was absolutely horrible. I don't even know if anyone else is out there. I don't know if anyone can hear me. I don't know how far this has gone but you have to believe me. The dead are eating the living. It sounds incredible. It sounds like some horrible movie but I swear to God. They're getting closer. I can hear them right outside the door. If anyone can hear me this is John Tester, I'm at the radio Mom, is Santa Claus coming to our house tonight? Can he bring us presents? Son, can you stop being a retard for just a minute. It's Christmas, duh? Bitch, leave him alone. He's probably like this because you spoke too much crap when you were pregnant. Don't worry, Santa got you. Yes, why don't you listen to your father and be a good little boy and sit there and shut up while we wait for the bus. Short bus. I remember, son, Santa only brings presents to good kids so no peeking at your presents at all. I'll have to lock you in your room like I did last year. Mom, Dad, when is the bus going to get here? I hope it gets here soon, I need a beer. Look asshole, it will get here when it gets here. It's bad enough we spent all day at the food bank so I could feed your worthless asses. Have you been a bad young man this year, Boy? No, I've been a good boy. My mom's always mad at me and Dad's always drunk. Hey, get the fuck out of here, will you? If you see Santa Claus tonight you better run for your lives, Pussy. Look the bus is going to be here any minute, get your passes ready. That boy's lucky it's Christmas or I'd kick his ass. The bus is going to be here in 10 seconds, get your shit together. Hey, you stupid retard, you're going to help me put this shit away since your father's out getting drunk. Seriously, I can't take this anymore. He's a useless dependent sucking us dry. For Christ's sake we're just going to give you up for adoption. Goddamnit, he's peeking through his presents again. Put your presents down. Don't you remember what happens to bad little boys on Christmas? Santa's going to take all your presents and give them to good little boys and girls. You rotten little brat, go to your room! (Inaudible) No, Forget about Santa, I have to think about what I'm going to do with your worthless ass. Come on, Let's go to your room. Frank, that's it, I can't take it anymore. You know the older he gets the more money causes and we're already gone on freaking food stamps already and all you do is drink. I think it's best if we just give him up for adoption. You need to get your ass out of the bar and get back home so we can take care of this. We need to get rid of this, I hate Daddy. I hate Mommy and Daddy. Son, I just had a long talk with your father on the phone. Yes, I know, I heard. You are going to send me away because you don't love me anymore because I'm retarded. It's not because you're retarded, it's because we don't love you anymore. Whatever, I hate you. Go away. I hate you Mom and Dad. My wish for you for Christmas is to go away. Mom, you ruined everything. I wish Santa Claus would come. I wish you were dead. Oh my God, what did you do to my husband. It's too late for that now (inaudible) to grant the wishes of special children especially the ones with evil parents (inaudible). No, no, no, please. (Inaudible) for Christmas, Mommy and Daddy will never bother you again. It's Mommy. Hi Mommy. Thank you, Santa. I feel like I want to fucking puke. So where is that asshole anyway? I don't know. He left a few hours ago. He never tells me where he's going. Jenny, I know it's none of my business but if Paul's starting to hit you, it's time he goes. It's only been a few times, only when he's drinking. Which is all the time now. I know. (Inaudible) chair I can defend myself. I think he's home. You should go. Okay. I'll come by in my lunch hour again tomorrow. I have to look into something but I could also be here to help the situation. Stacy, you can't say anything. I won't. I'll see you tomorrow. It's a good thing that bitch left. I would have tossed her out. You know she's the only friend I've got left. You've pissed off all the others. It's me who pays the bills around here, all right. I do... We've been living off my disability check for three months now. When are you going to get a job. Don't start on that shit again. So now you're saying I can't even talk to you. Not if it's something I don't want to hear. You know, Paul, if you're not happy here you should consider leaving. Look, I told you before the only way anyone's leaving around here is in a body bag. And that's it... He hit me in the head and walked off. We haven't spoken since. How long has Paul been hitting you? I don't know. It's been getting a lot worse lately. Well I know it's the right thing to do. About what? About this. What is it? You know the lab I work for does a lot of experimental drugs. It's not even on the market yet. It's for people who are paralyzed who can walk for a short period of time. What did you have to do to get this? Don't ask. It should last up to 24 hours but it takes about six hours before you start to feel the results. That's enough time to get away from him. Take it now. By seven o'clock tonight you should be able to stand and function normally. How can I thank you? Just get away from that asshole and don't tell anyone where you got it. I've got to go. Good luck. What? You can't say hi to me when I come in? Hi. Fucking look at me when I'm talking to you. I'm not going to get into this shit again, Paul. Things are going to change around here a lot sooner than you think. Don't fucking back talk me. Paul go fuck yourself. Jenny? Jenny? Jenny? Fuck. Fuck. Oh my God, I'm dying, Jack, but I can't stop. Put another one in. Oh God, we're going to die. We're going to die watching this evil shit. Please, please help. No more of that. And now our feature program. Please, please don't kill me, I'll find you some (inaudible). Please. Sheriff (inaudible). It's Becket, Sir. A woman died in the cornfield. The coroner thinks it's an accident but won't know for sure until they take the hatchet out of her chest. I see. Well let me know if her condition changes. Oh, you scared me, Mary. You just remember that when I eat chicken later. That sounds like a good idea. I want a fried egg sandwich. I think I'll take mine hard boiled. Why would you say that? Did you see the Easter Bunny? He was here. Jamie, the Easter Bunny doesn't come out on Halloween. Now go get into your costume. Criselda, what are you doing here? Sheriff (inaudible), I saw the Easter Bunny. I'm sure you did... And everyone else who's celebrating this Pagan holiday. Please, so you know? No, (inaudible). The Easter Bunny's going to be there? Male (Inaudible) It's so weird going out in public dressed like this. But you look hot, like a snake (inaudible) I wish I had your confidence. There are not many girls I know who'd go out of the house dressed as a chicken. Chickens are sexy. It looks like bee stings. Bee stings? Look at the swollen areas of the head. You should call an exterminator. How do you explain the bloody baseball bat? It's a toy. They were trying to get the bees, they got themselves at times. Hey, can I get out of here? My wife's going to dress up like Kurtwood Smith tonight and we're going to re-enact the murder scene from Robocop. Your wife's a dead ringer for Kurtwood Smith. You go on. We'll bag these two. I have a bad feeling. Did you use that cream I gave you? My feeling is emotional. Well then you should go talk to the Vulcan. It was the Easter Bunny. You know the Leapers? He knows you. He would just pry open the door before you can close it. Watch for Jesus, he'll save you. (Foreign language) (Foreign language) There are many people here, My Lord. Dogs bark when cars go by. Yes but only when children eat their young. You are wise, Ruth. I will take you for my bride but for now we must be vigilant in our cause. Ready the catapult. But we do not have catapults. We were told to bring signs only. Then tonight they will witness the signs. Jamie, this is the farmer. He offered to harvest my eggs. Hello farmer. Have you seen the Easter Bunny? He was in the bathroom. I think he needed to take a pee. We were going to sneak away to the bedroom to take a little hang. Would you like to watch? No, I'm going to be busy hunting rabbis. Don't you mean rabbits? Yes, but if I find a rabbi first I'll ask him to help. Goodbye Jamie and may your search yield positive results. What's the matter? Has your cow been knocked? I have to go pee-pee. I've warmed up the hay to your liking. Are you not properly stimulated for coitus? Thanks Babe. So how's my party (inaudible)? Thanks for the party, Tommy. The Easter Bunny has exposed himself as a killer. The prophecy shall now be fulfilled. It's my brother. No, there's another. I hope your dance card's not full because I'm about to join the shindig. (Foreign language) (Inaudible) (Inaudible) Yes, Man. Man, help me. Where are you at, my man? Help me, please. You've got to take this thing away from me. Okay, calm the fuck down. Give me your address. Okay, (inaudible) got it. So hang tight, man. I can't stop, it's got me. Today is not your lucky day, Man. Hello. Don't be playing the fucking games, Man. Dumb ass junky mother fuckers. Oh, what do we have here, Man? Mexico City 2011... It was a good year, Man. Hello, we had an appointment, I believe. Did you get it? You said I'd have the machine. Yes man, I know what I fucking said. Chill out. $350 a night, $25 a tape. It's all there, Man. Never trust a man, right? Trust is hard to find these days. Well go on, beat it. You look like a fed standing there. Man, I've got your number if you want some more.
