Move! This way, follow me! Hurry up! Start the machine, boys. Let's go. Let's go, Beli. - Let's go, boss. Hello, comrades! - Hello! What are you doing, old man? I've never seen a thing like this before. How much does it cost? - Are you a buyer, old man? - I'm not. That is my machine. Hello, comrades. - Hello. - Where are you coming from, comrade? - From afar away. Sit down, friend. Which is the best way to get to Krst Rakoc? - Why do you want to go to Krst Rakoc? We're making an orchard there. There's a forest on Krst Rakoc. Our forest. What forest? You're calling that brushwood a forest, you have no use of it anyway. It doesn't matter. It's good for us, and it should stay for us. We're making an orchard on Krst Rakoc, ten villages will live of it. We'll release the land from brushwood, we?ll plow it. Others will come, to bring scions. Krst Rakoc will become the biggest orchard in Metohija. - We don't need an orchard. Maybe your children will need it. Orchard is nice, but wind is infesting across Krst Rakoc. - I know. Where's wind, there's no orchard. Even children in our village know that. We'll tame the wind. On hill Gustar we're rising a new, tall forest. It will protect the tableland from the wind. - You want to be a chauffeur, kid? - Yes! Come on, get down. I don't like this adventure of ours. - You wanted to come here, now what? Hello, pal. - Hello. I'm a chauffeur too. - What do you drive? That thing. - Who's truck is that? - Purchase station's. Nice car! Would you like to be in my position? - You're joking. Who knows... Sometimes I talk seriously. - You're a Shqiptar? - I am. My name is Abdurrahman Khaleshi, engineer. We came to help you. - They came to burn our forests on Krst Rakoc! We don't need that kind of help! - It seems you all think like this man here. Let's go Khaleshi. Let's not waste time. - Start the machines! What are these villagers complaining about? - They don't want you to plow the bushwood. Let's go, boys! - Visit us sometimes on Krst Rakoc. Good luck! - Goodbye. Don't be scared! Good afternoon, comrades. - Good afternoon, welcome. What's the name of this beautiful place? - Krst Rakoc. So that is Krst Rakoc. If you don't mind me asking, where are you from, comrade? - From Dusanovac. Dusanovac? What is that? Village or a town? You've never heard of Dusanovac? - No. - Pity, people walk on their hands there. You won't be bored here. Here's the engineer. Good afternoon, comrade engineer. - Good afternoon, comrades. Is everything done? - Everything is done. We've been expecting you yesterday. - We were late waiting for new machines. Unfortunately, we didn't get them. - Boys, we've finally arrived in California! I think we'll have a good time here. - Five months is not such a long time. Even three days is too much in this desert/ - I don't like this place. - I'm delighted! It's better to spend three years in the navy, than three years here. Every third day, workers will bring you fresh groceries. I'm sure you'll be satisfied with that. I wanted to tell you something else. While we were raising camp, I heard many things. Villages nearby are not pleased with your new project. Nor Montenegrian nor Shqiptarians. They won't just give away Krst Rakoc on the plate. - I know, it's about gaze. 'Forbidden entry'. Why is it forbidden? Take it easy, maybe it's dynamite. And what a dynamite it is! Report to the company that everything is alright here. We'll start working tomorrow. Have a safe trip and send our regards. - Goodbye, comrades. I wish you the best of luck. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, pay us a visit! Boss, how do you like this Krst Rakoc? - And you? It's very good. And we have to plow all this? - First we have to burn the bushwood, then plow it. So this is our country house. Boys, it doesn't look so bad. Slow down! Wipe your feet so you don't get the carpet dirty. It's seems this one is the softest. - That will be mine then. What? Can't you see it's too long for you? Beli, did you bring slippers? - I didn't, I'll use yours. Jan, do you have some nails to hang these pictures? - I do. Little memories won't hurt. Let the comrades on Krst Rakoc know that Beli is not just anyone. Winner of dance marathon in Rijeka. And special, junior champion of Belgrade in welterweight category. What do you say about this? - Congratulations, I didn't know you were such a good dancer and boxer. - I was, I'm not anymore. It doesn't pay off. A man gets beaten for small money. And you comrade Khaleshi? Any sports? - Horse riding, I'm in the saddle for 5 years. You don't say? I like horses very much. Rodja and I were going to races every week. I like the guys like you, Beli. But it would be better to forget races for a while. At least while we're here. Beli, what do you say about this? Are they your Slavicas? Like no one else has a mother! I hope you didn't forget the picture of old good granny. - Enough, Beli! Weather will surely change. What is it, boss? - Nothing, nothing. Will that cook show up already? Rodja, go check what's with the dinner. And with cook too. - OK. OK? What is that mean? - That means 'alright' in Dusanovac. - Comrade? Comrade? - Yes? What's with the dinner? We're hungry. - I'll bring it right away. Do you want my help? - No, thanks. Everything's ready, sorry I'm a little late. I'm coming right away. She'll bring it right away, she's a little late. What's for dinner? - I don't know. I'd so drink a schnapps right now. Who's idea it was not to bring schnapps to this desert? - Mine! I know what schnapps is. You know everything. - Kosta liked schnapps like you, Beli. Poor Kosta. It's unbelievable how much you look like him. Boss, please! Who is that Kosta? Let's not talk about him again! Allow me, I'll do it. - Thank you. Good evening. - Good evening. Thank you. We don't need you anymore. Girl, you can at least tell us your name. - Andjelka. Andjelka? I always liked angels. - So did I. Are you kidding? Girl like that will never like you. Maybe she will. Who is it? - Who else could be? It's me, Jan. Access if forbidden here. - I know, I just wanted to help you. I suppose that's not forbidden. I know how to peel potatoes, and to wash dishes. I know how to sing too. Look how nice it is here. I would like to live in a house like this. How did you get here? - I came to work, like you. - Are you married? I am not. - Were you married? There's still no one, but let's hurry. Give me the oil. Come on. Quickly. Until the peasants bring their cattle. Yes, yes, I thought of that right away. Disappointed in love. I make no mistakes in making diagnoses. What have they done to you so you had to come to Krst Rakoc? Let me go! You're so wild! Get out! Or I'll tell everything! - Alright! Then I'll tell something to the boss. 'Boss, she called me!' 'Then we had a little fight!' - Get out! Bastard! - Alright. Beli! - Rodja! Rodja! Rodja! Rodja! Beli! I'm over here! Why don't you look after yourselves? Quickly, this way! You're too late, Esad. They were quicker. Your sheep will have to gaze on your meadow from now on. Boss, how's it going? - It's good, just keep going! Is it enough? - It is, 90cm. Boys are working great. If wouldn't have found boys like this in the whole wide world. Come on, Marko! Let's clear this! How about we call Andjelka, too? That would've been a real dance. Andjelka is a peasant, she can't dance. - Why a peasant? Maybe she knows. Rodja, invite her. - Why me? Because you're the youngest. Beli, aren't you bored already? On contrary, I feel very pleasant. Nice nature, music, women. If only there's something to drink... Do you like... - Do I like? What? Music. - Who doesn't like music? Let's dance then. - I don't know how to dance. - We'll teach you. - No. Come on, angel, leave that potatoes and let's dance. I don't know how to beg. - Thank you. Do you see how it's done, Rodja? Watch and learn! You'll need it in life. Look at that, wild cat has come! Did Mrs. mother let you go to dance? - Let's begin, angel. Loose the apron. Just be brave, angel! I thought you were just a good cook. It's alright boys! Angel is talented! Well done, angel! Beli, rock! Let's dance, angel. - I don't know that, thank you. Rodja, come here, let's show Andjelka! Faster, Beli, faster! That's it, Beli! Come on, Jan! Angel, what is it now? - I have to go, it was nice, thank you. - Where to? I have laundry to wash, then dinner. - To hell with laundry and dinner! Can't we have a little fun? I would so smash someone's face now! Beli, Beli! - What is it? What happened? - Boss went for a walk. To get some fresh air. - Where? - Who knows. I'm curious what's he doing at night. - Go to sleep, what's wrong with you? If only that wind could stop. - Enough! Boss, you went for a walk again last night. What can you do in this desert at night? Beli, when you get in my age, you'll know what is insomnia. Hey boys! German helmet! Give it to me. Give it to me. - Wait a minute, this is the first time I'm wearing German helmet. How do I look? - Like an alien! Attention! - It's good thing that boys don't know what German helmet meant once. Real children. To the right! March, march! Who drew this well? - That's a secret, boss! Come on, Beli, hurry up! Jan is right. - Jan is a scoundrel! - He's right when he says you're wild. Angel, why are you like that? Can't you love me a little? True, I can't promise you marriage, but... We could spend a few nice days. Angel, you won't regret it. Girl, I like that! You're the first who slapped me. Slap me again. Come on, again. Come on. You don't want to? Alright. I'm alone tomorrow before noon, OK? You are... You are... - You'll tell me that tomorrow. And please, don't leave me flowers anymore! Flowers? I wanted to be gentle. Ciao! Beli! Watch your gutters! Go around the ditch! Let's go! It's time! Boss! Boss, we won't spend the night here! Do you hear me? Let's go, Marko! It's late already! I can't stand straight. - What happened? I don't hear. - What? You will hear! Boss is gone mad! To hell with overtime! - Beli, what's the matter with you? Nothing! Good morning, Andjelka. - Good morning, Ramiz. What have you brought for us today, Ramiz? - Little peas, potatoes, paprika, some meat and... - What else? Mail! Mail! Wait, slow down, where are you headed? - Let me go! Jan Pecnik. Jan Pecnik. This one says 'comrade Beli, chauffeur on Krst Rakoc'. - That's me. Abdurrahman Khaleshi. Rodja Jovanovic. Jan Pecnik. This one smells like a perfume. You said you have two Slavica. - Miroslav Ratkovic. - Me! This one knows your real name. Jan Pecnik. Abdurrahman Khaleshi. Official mail. There's no more. Maybe the letter got lost. Andjelka, don't be sad. Do you want to read my letter together? - Why should I read your letters? My mother is writing to me. Be careful, nights are cold there. Before you go to bed, wear undershirt... You surely don't care about this. You know how it is when mother writes her only son. I never loved you like now. Probably because you're far away from me. Hour doesn't go by without me wondering 'What is my Rodja doing?' We had noodles with plums, that's your favourite meal. Dad... That's really my stepfather. He couldn't not remember you. We were so hard for you not being with us. Foolishness. What is it Beli? - Pump broke. - Machine was fine yesterday. It was yesterday, but not today. And you know what pump is. - How long? A few hours, 2,3 the most. - Alright. We'll wait you up there. Good morning, girl. I didn't keep my word. I should've come ten days ago. Girls are always waiting for me. But I'm the one who never shows up. Angel, I'm completely yours now. - Please, get away from me! Maybe I was a little hard with you. But I'll try not to be in the future. Angel, are you mad? Why? Maybe you like Jan better. Alright. Alright, girl. But I'll teach him a lesson! This is your baby? - Yes, that's my child! Girl! - I'm not a girl! - That's what I wanted to hear. No more nice words! - Leave me alone! Let me go, Beli, I'll scream! - Scream as much as you want! No one will hear you. Please, let me go, Beli! Let me go! Let me go! Beli! Come over here. Machine is broken. - It isn't, everything is fine. What have you done? - I removed the pump. - So you can stay with Andjelka? I think that Kosta you're mentioning so much would've do the same. - He was irascible like you, but he didn't lie! He wasn't tempter! - But boss... - Not another word! I believed you're a good guy so far, despite all your incidents. But now you've showed your real face. Shame on you! Colleague, you're primping a lot these days. - Yes, you seem to have problem with that? Did you pick flowers again today? For who should I pick flowers? - You know that better. Flowers... Listen Jan, I'd advised you to stay faithful to your Slavica! You didn't say which one. - I don't care! You're writing to your mother? - Yes. To who else could I write? - I don't know, I'm just asking. I'm writing her about you too. - About me? Why about me? Andjelka is that kind of girl, that you would've liked her too. You're not angry? - No. I don't deserve that. She's pretty. - She was pretty. Did you leave flowers for me? Yes, I did. - Thank you. I won't tell anyone. Excuse me. Did Countess invited you to a ball? - What? You wanted to see Andjelka? I wanted to smash your face! What is it? - I don't know, something is happening. What is it? Have you gone mad? I didn't know you play with two cards. I didn't know you're a slut! - She's not a slut! I know best is it her fault! - I swear, it's not my fault! Andjelka has nothing to with our fight. - Are you playing a lover here too? It's not her fault. - It's our fault! We were bored, very bored! Like in church! We won't give you our forests! - We won't give you Red Meadows! Stop, stop! Beli! - Beli! Stop, stop! Stop, Beli, stop! Beli! Beli! Stop! Stop! Where are you going? Stop! Are you insane? Stop! Where are you going? - What do you want? Why did you gather these people? Stop! - Drop that! I'll talk to them. You can go home, we won't plow Red Meadows. - Machine will go first! That's right! They have to go! - Boys, return machines to the camp. Two of us will come with you. Where? - To the village, with you. Hold on, comrades! Hold on, let's talk. I know that Shqiptars aren't afraid of talking. Those who are, they can go! My name is Khaleshi. - We heard. - I'm Shqiptar. I was born in village Basha, near Djakovica. My father's name was Sulejman Khaleshi, he was a peasant, like you. If you think that your village can't live without Red Meadows, and bushwoods that you call forests, we will stop plowing. We won't give Red Meadows and our forests! And remember Khaleshi, we live the way we want! Esad, you cowardly talk against us to these people. - Making up and messing! Have you ever been a season worker? - Even if I haven't, I wasn't living on your back. - Wait! I know Khaleshi. Do you remember me? Bajrami? - You remembered. Few years ago no one believe there will be vines on Bela Gora. Only Khaleshi did. - Continue, councilman. - It was the same thing there as here. It was shot twice on Khaleshi from ambush, but Bela Gora was covered with vines. Hello comrades. - Hello. - Come on, who wants to go to Bela Gora? I'm going there anyway, I'll take you. We have nothing to do there! We live here! - Who wants to go? Comrade Khaleshi, continue your job on Krst Rakoc. We'll make sure that these conflicts doesn't happen again. - Take my horse and return. Continue your work, I'll go with them to Bela Gora. - Goodbye. - Don't worry. Khaleshi! Fire! Fire! On your feet comrades! What? What happened? - Hurry, hurry! Quickly! Machines! Save the machines, quickly! Jan! What is it? Something's wrong! Get down, the tank will explode! - I can't start the machine! Andjelka, bandage! What is with machine? - I don't know! Rodja, get your machine, take him out! Jan, attach it! Quickly until the roof collapses! It's good, drive! Comrade Khaleshi, if this rain continues, we won't plow for the next five days. It's pouring so much... Rain. Like we're in a mouse trap. When there's no damn wind, it rains. Or the sun shines so your brain boils. Kozara with premiere of Italian movie, Rocco and His Brothers. Jadran, Soviet movie, Clear Sky, Partisan, American movie, The Hanging tree. Hanging tree... Comrade Khaleshi, can you send this weather away? I'm bored. Grab a book and read. A book? If I wanted to read, I'd be professor, not a chauffeur, and here on Krst Rakoc. Grba? Who was that Grba? He must've been a partisan. We were in the same squad until he got killed. Did something happen? - Nothing happened. That's the worst part, boss, nothing is happening here. - You want to argue? On places like these, people are biting like beasts. I just want to argue, for now. And later? - Who knows? Anything can happen. Why are you laughing, boss? You're a strange boy, Beli. - If I'm not among people in three days, I may kill someone! You'll stay here. - Is that an order? - It is. Don't forget, you signed a contract. Boss, why don't you let me go. You see I can't take no more. I can't stand this wilderness and solitude. I can live without Belgrade. It's in my blood. I don't like this area. I have nothing in common with fruits, I even hate fruits! Now they started to burn us. We escaped last night, and tomorrow? We can burn like logs. And where is comrade Khaleshi? - He went to the village. Barrack didn't catch fire by itself. Beans again. I think I have gravel in my stomach. We'll take it ourselves, thank you. Andjelka, you pour it for me. Rodja, pour some for me. It's enough. Boss, was that Kosta of yours also been such a cruel man? What have I done wrong? Jan, don't whistle! What is it, boss? - Nothing, nothing. Don't whistle! Why didn't you take it with queen? Nine and four are thirteen. Well, I don't like math. I'll pay attention from now on. Here's 2. I don't have it. 8. Jan, stop it! Boss, was Kosta Grba's friend too? I have an 8, and Kosta... He was... - Enough! Jan! Why does it bother you? - Because you're out of tone! It was bothering me when you were whistling here on our first night, so what? I was quiet, now you be quiet! Stop! Why did you do that? I can look at same faces all the time. I'm sick of you, your peasants and Kosta! Get out. Get out! Here, take a good look at me and remember, I was silent and putting up, and Marko too. He was giving you his overtime hours, he gave his money to keep you, it's enough now! Who doesn't want to stay, leave! Right away! This night! Marko and I will stay. We learned how to work and how to fight war, but not to suffer and put up with bums! Khaleshi, in the village, do they know anything about the fire? They suspect Esad, but they don't have proofs Esad is clever, he won't fell into trap easily. You're keeping watch, huh? My young lover, maybe I should tell you something about your dear. Your angel has one little angel. His father is unknown. - Shut up! If you say another word, I'll smash your teeth! You forget that I'm a bastard too. I cried many tears for my father that I've never seen. And my mom, just like Andjelka, loved a man that wasn't a nam! And she had to hide my photos from people like you! I'll be happy when I wouldn't have to look at your faces again! You're all so nice and smart, only I'm bad. Tempter, boring, only I like money. And you? Do you work for glory maybe? I'm enough of everything. I found my dead comrades. Grba, Skender, Sadik and Ratko. - I know. I came to help you. What are you thinking about? Just like that. Where is the child now? With one woman in Pec. We had to hold Germans until dawn. Brigade was falling back, saving wounded men. I had a mission that with few men hold Germans back. It was only five of us. We held the enemy. Only I survived. With heavy wounds. Sadik, Ratko, Skender and Grba were dead. I crawled to some ditch, I didn't have a single bullet, not even for me. At dawn, Germans were charging to my dead comrades. I survived. Is that a fortune when only one man stay alive? I'll bury them here. Mate! - Yes? - A cognac! - Right away. I didn't see you here before. Are you a chauffeur, kid, huh? - I'm not. I'm a professor. And you? What do you drink? - Cognac. Cognac for the lady, and for me too. - Right away. Mate, another one. Here you go. They think I'm nobody. A tempter! Only I love money. - Who thinks that? I didn't say anything to you. - Who are you talking to? To people who are 50km away from here. What's your name? - Janko. And for the lady. So you escaped. I did. So what? - Of course, it's nicer here. Let's have another one! - Sure! Shall we sit for a while? - I can't, honey. I'm taken. I have jealous fiancee. Shall we sit? - Alright. Waiter! Only you love me! Damn you... No one loves me. I hate you! I hate you all! I can't take it anymore. I didn't escape, I didn't... I didn't! - You have to pay, young man. Give the money! Here you go! Let me go! Don't push me! Give it to me! To me! - Give me the money! Prepare the bill. Who doesn't give the money back will deal with me. Music! I want music! - Calm down! Sit down already! Waiter! A drink! Come on, let's go. I'm not sorry. Girl and I spent a few nice hours. She has a beautiful apartment. It's all in flowers. - Apartment is very important. How does she look like? - She's blond. Her hair has the color of old gold. And deep blue eyes. And the skin white as the snow. Maybe she's anemic? How did you meet? How? She was lonely too. She works in Pec as a book keeper in some factory. She's unusually nice and polite girl. She reads a lot, likes picnics and nature. She loves what? - Nature! Later, she took me to her apartment. We listened the radio, we danced. And it was plenty of flowers around us. Yes, plenty of flowers. When we leave this hell hole, and get down to Pec, I'll introduce you to her. Then you'll believe me. - Will you show us her apartment, with flowers? Shut up, Jan! Comrade Khaleshi, how long will we stay in this California? - I don't hear anything! How long will we stay in this hell? - A few more days! Boys, a few days more! Marko buried the bones of his comrades last night. Now I understand why he was getting up at night so often. So this is the place where your comrades died? - Yes. Boss, this is to humble monument. This will be the prettiest monument for them when the peaches blossom. Pero, when brigade with scions come, place them and give them the camp. Alright! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Boss, our plowing is finished! Where will we go on spring? To the Pirate wood. Do you want to come with me? I'll let you know, it's a long time until spring. Let's go. - Let's have a bet that will Andjelka ride with Rodja. I don't want to lose the bet. - Beli, will you show me your girl that has a house with flowers in Pec. The one with deep blue eyes. Jan, you're starting again. THE END Translated by Inglourious @KG
