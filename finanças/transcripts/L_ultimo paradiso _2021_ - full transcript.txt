Let's go. - Ciccio! - [woman 2] It's late. - Put me down! - Bianca, please! - [laughing] - It's gonna be close! - Come on. It's late. - [shrieks] - [Ciccio grunts] [Bianca sighs] [woman 2] Bianca. Turn around. - Turn around. - [man] I'll see you tonight? Mm-hmm. - At the house near the cemetery. - Yes. By the fountain. - Mm-hm. - [man] Hm? [man moans] [Bianca chuckles] Jesus Christ. That's enough. What's wrong with you? - Come on. Let's go. - [Ciccio] Yeah, what's wrong with you? Hm? - Oh, not a word. - What? - You're a devil. - Ciao. - Ciao. - [Bianca] Bye. - [Ciccio] Ciao. - [woman 2] Okay, ciao. Ciao. [Bianca laughing] [church bell tolls] [church bell tolls] [church bell tolls] Again? Stop that! [grunts] Always eating this rubbish! Get! [indistinct chatter] - Help Grandma? - Yes. - Can you do it? - Yes. Look. Just like this, okay? - You make it long and thin. Try. - [door closes] [footsteps approaching] These are bad for you. How many times do I have to tell you? How many? Just let him be. They never killed anyone. Now, this you can eat. Okay? Here. [crunching] [dog barks] [indistinct chatter] What time did Ciccio come back last night? [indistinct chatter] [crickets chirping] Listen, I said no. I'm not coming to town with you. I know. I'm gonna go alone, then. Bianca, you're playing with fire. I mean, Ciccio is married, and he has two children. - [man] Cosimo, we need water here! - Don't you understand? - Everyone knows. - Give me an olive. Ah, these are good. Stop working. Food is here. Break time! Come and eat! Come on. Let's go grab a sandwich. [man] They need water. Cosimo! [indistinct chatter] - Just a little cheese, please. - Mm-hmm. - [man] How are these sandwiches? - [woman 1] Very good. Go ahead and eat. - [woman 2] Very good. - [man] Thank you. Cosimo. Are you not feeling well? You've been in the sun too long. Go get some rest in the barn. You're done for today. Go on. [whistling] - You don't even stop and say hi? - Linda. No time for me anymore, but you have time for Schettino's daughter. - Everyone in town knows. - Be nice. Go home. [boy] Papa! Papa! Rocchi! - Well, you see what I brought? - Yes. You like her? Want to name her? - Huh? - She's black. She's black. Then we call her Blackie. - Okay? - Yes. So, here. Take this. Take the rope. - Let's put her there. - [bleats] Here, come on. Okay. Where's your mom? - Dunno. - What do you mean you don't know? - Nope. - Hey! You rascal. - You love Papa? - Yeah. - Hm? - Yes. Good boy. Hey, look after her. Okay? Luci! Lucia? [door closes] [door opens] - [door closes] - I fell asleep… You've really taken after my father, you know? When you were little, he held you and say, "Ninetta." "He's not even two years old, and listen to him talk!" "He'll be able to do whatever he wants in life." And now… What's wrong with your head? What's wrong? [kisses] Stop it! [soft guitar playing] Did you ever think about leaving this place, Mom? To go live somewhere else, with different people, different language. Hmm? No. I'm happy here. With my children. Antonio didn't write this month. Think he's forgotten us? Antonio? Antonio will always be there for us. He thinks about us every month. I want to get out of this town. [footsteps approaching] You have such beautiful hair. What are you wearing underneath? Show me. - Show me what you have under your shirt. - No. - Please. No. - Come on, show me. No? Go on. Turn around! Open your legs. [Tina screaming] [exhales] [church bell tolls] [crickets chirping] - Hey. - [Maria] Hey, Ciccio. - Where's your husband? - He's still in town with the girls. Huh. He's still in town? Do you have some coffee? [Maria] I just made some. Have a seat. Thanks. It's good. - Better than Franco's. - What did you put in my husband's head? You know very well what happens to people who oppose the mayor. What, you afraid? [Maria] I have two daughters. Do you understand? - You want them to live in this place? - I don't want to raise them by myself. [indistinct chatter] Who's next? Name. Domenico Stigliano. - [Don Luigi] How many olives do you have? - Two tomoli. Two? Well done. Hey. There you go. [Domenico] Is that it? I won't be able to live three months with this amount. I have two children. I've worked the land for a whole year. You think this is easy? You have no idea. There are taxes to be paid to the state. And who pays them? You? Do you pay them? I pay them! Get that in your head. [sighs] Here. And that's the end of it. Go on! Get out of here. Next. - Name. - [Ciccio] Ciccio Paradiso. [man 1] What the fuck is he doing? This year, the prices of olives is 2,000 lires. Yeah? And who's buying them? I am. [Giustino] Ciccio, I have three very good tomoli near the river. I'll have two more ready in a week. I'll take them. Really? Huh? No more America! Enough with this traitor bleeding us dry. The oil must be paid for this year. It's not free. [somber music playing] Oh! Why the long faces? Next round is on me! No sleeping tonight! [all] Yeah! Ciccio! Ciccio! [clapping] [cheering, clapping] ♪ Hoe the soil! ♪ Come on, a toast to everybody! - Hey. - Hi. Hi, Mom. Did you hear what happened? Mario almost killed himself. You know why? His son, Pinuccio, died while he was working. He was just 13. The Carabinieri pretend nothing happened. And we're just sitting here… [bangs] I don't want to hear this talk in my house. You know what they pay for a day's work. Those bastards, Buccella, Cataldo, Schettino. Huh? Just four hundred shitty lires! 400 lires, Pop! A liter of milk costs 100. You have to think about your family, not other people's shit. Hey! Calm down. Maria, the bread. Where were you last night? Huh? Lucia, please. Why don't you answer your wife? Huh? You really hate this house. Don't like it anymore. Huh? Just like your grandfather. - Whose legs were you between, last night? - [Ciccio] Whatever. What do these women have, huh? Honey between their legs? Lucia, please. [Lucia] Go on. Go on back to your whores! [door slams] [birds chirping] [exhales] - Look. - What is it? [gasps] Where did you get that? [Ciccio] This… Basically, my aunt… she helped an American soldier who was sick. And he left it for her. [French song playing] What's he saying? Who knows. He's French. It's beautiful, though. It's wonderful. We have to travel. Meet new kinds of people. We cannot die here. Let's go to Paris. And maybe we can even learn French. So we can understand what this beautiful song says. You're so beautiful. Every time I see you, it's like my head is on fire and I can't make sense of anything. My hands sweat, and my legs shake. Bianca. [Don Luigi] For the respect that I show you, my friend, you have to give this bastard a serious talking to! You have to do it now! You need to make him shit his pants! He has to understand who's in charge! You own 50 hectares of wheat and olives! Fifty! I mean, you're the boss, aren't you? You are! Not him! I pay 2,000 lires per 100 kilos to you only, and nobody else! So, you have to speak to him. You have to bring him right here, and he has to apologize to me. Don Luigi, you have my word that… I will talk to Ciccio, but… if he's like his father, it's going to be hard. - But I'll try and let you know. - Thank you. I prepared a demijohn of good oil. You can pick it up downstairs. You're always kind. Thank you. - You're welcome, Don Luigi. - Thank you. [door closes] Tonight, I want here the Gentile family, the Varasanos, Donadios, Moranos, Pellittas and Pastores. I want them here tonight. I'll take care of Ciccio. - I'll see you later. Bye. - See you later. [church bells toll] Cosimo Schettino inside the church? It must be a miracle. Is he going to take the vows? [Vincenzo] You're playing with fire. If Schettino knows you're seeing Bianca, you'll have two options. You either marry her, or you marry her. And I think you're married already. Leave it alone. You have plenty of women. Vince, she's not just a woman. At night, when she laughs, she makes the sun rise. But you can't understand. Nobody can. Okay… - Come on. Let's go get a beer. - Cicc. - Cicc. Cicc. - [laughs] [Vincenzo] You're such a dickhead. Get off me. Always fucking around. [soft music playing] [Tonino] Ciccio, wait. Tonino. Schettino wants to talk to you. He says it's important. [clamoring] [indistinct arguing] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, calm down. - No, no, no, we all go in together! - Listen to me! - I have had enough! - Stop it. We'll beat the shit out of him! - Go on. Get lost! - Enough. Ciccio! - Listen. - Vincenzo. Let me do the talking. I'll handle it. [knocking] [door opens] [door closes] May I? Come, come. Cosimo, grab him a chair. A nice glass of wine, what do you say? [sighs] Bianca, bring us some wine. Do you know my daughter, Bianca? No. Salut. Salut. [Schettino sighs] How's your family? Your wife's name is Lucia. Wait. And your son is… - Rocchino. - Rocchino. They all right? Yes, thanks. Do you know how many years I've known your family? Your father and I, when we were young, we were like brothers. Or even more. Did you know your grandfather was my godfather? Then he met a girl and went to America. And he left your grandmother alone with three children. Do you know how old the girl was? Sixteen. Your grandfather, 55. [sighs] [sighs] No, thank you. So, what's this story about the olives? You know better than me. Yes, but Don Luigi told me that the other night, at Palladino's tavern, you... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He built his fortune on the shoulders of poor people. [chuckles] The families sweat blood on the land all year, and then he comes along, and without doing shit, he earns three times as much. Schettino, I'm like my father. Nobody has ever bent me. And if somebody wants to go to war with me… [grunts] …it'll be messy. Tell your friend. We hoe the soil. And we make the price. [chuckles] You are right. Well said. You've got balls, kid. I'll give you that. Like your father. You can't help it. Blood is blood. All right. I have things to do. Cosimo, show him out. Thanks for the visit. [bangs] [door closes] [crickets chirping] [indistinct chatter [car approaching] [brakes screeching] - Hi, Don Luigi. - Hi. Sorry to ask, but mind giving me a ride into town? [Don Luigi grunts] [thuds] [groans] What, what do you want? For God's sakes, what do you want? Shh. Everyone in heaven is asleep right now. - [punching] - [Don Luigi screaming] I get it. Do you want money? Here. [screams] [grunts] Help! He's crawling. He even crawls like a pig. [Don Luigi groans] - [kicking] - [Don Luigi groaning] Piece of shit! You want all the money, huh? You want all the money! - Piece of shit. - [groans] [groans] Enough, Domenico. Enough! Let's go. [somber music playing] [sighs] [speaking indistinctly] [crickets chirping] [crackles] [sighs] You're my flower. [gasps] Hi. [kissing] Are you crazy? - Ciccio, what are you doing? - Come with me. - Shh. - Let's go to the barn. - Come. - No, no, no. I can't go anywhere. [kisses] [chuckles] Ciccio, I can't. [Ciccio] Come, let's go. Shh, shh. - [Bianca chuckles] - [Ciccio] Come. - Come here. - [sighs] If my father finds out, it'll be a mess. Sooner or later, he has to find out. Bianca. [kisses] Bianca. [kisses] When I'm with you, it's like… it's like time stops. And I hear music. Bianca. I want to be with you forever. [sighs] But do you love Lucia? Yes. But you're different. Something that doesn't exist here. [soft music playing] [breathing heavily] [kissing] There is a lot of olives this year. They won't be able to pick all of them. We'll have to figure something out. We spent the night together, the whole night. In the stable? You're out of your mind. You're going to end up a nun. Go to the town center and see if somebody wants to work with us. When did he leave? I don't know. It was morning. I left him there. I'm going to get some hay. One of the horses is limping. We need to shoe it again. Cosimo, I'll come with you. [rattles] - You hear that? - No. What? No, I didn't… Cosimo, I didn't hear... - It's probably just some animal... - Maria! Wait, no, Cosimo! You… get the hay for Dad, before he gets upset. Might be a snake. Yeah, don't worry about it. I'm going in. [squeaking] [closes] Ciccio? Ciccio! Oh, my God. You need to get out of here. - Is he gone? - Yeah, he left. Hurry up. Just go out the window. - Bye, Maria. See you around. - Move, move! Go! [squeaking] [closes] Mr. Schettino, I respect you, but Don Luigi's been sucking our children's blood forever. Are you talking to me about respect? Who helped you when, uh, your wife was sick? You. Whenever you needed something, who'd you come see? You. This is respect. Not the one you talk about. But waging war won't help anyone. We want to live in peace. [footsteps approaching] [Ciccio] Lucia. [rattles] Rocchino, get off there. What are you doing? Where did you get this? Come here. Go home, right now! Go home. Go. I woke up this morning in a cold sweat because he wasn't in bed. I thought I was going to die. Giustino found him. He was looking for you. Let's go outside. Don Felice's here. I don't come here to confess. There's no need. I haven't committed any sins. I come here to understand. [exhales] There's nothing to understand, Lucia. I do love you. But we want different things. A sin to you isn't to me. - Bianca, wait. - [chuckles] [Ciccio] Come on. Wait for me. [chuckles] Bianca? Wait up. Bianca? Stop playing around. Come on. Bianca. [chuckles] That's dangerous. Get down. Come on. Please, get down. - My father was staring at us. - [Ciccio] Yes, he did. Come down. I think he knows. Oh… Do you hear me? Bianca. Bia. It's not safe. Okay then. I'll buy you the most beautiful long dress. You'll look like a queen. - Red. - Yes, red. [chuckles] And I also want a ring. Close your eyes. We will leave in two days' time. Don't tell lies. Or the angel will come and say amen. Read it. I'll bring it to your father tomorrow morning. [scoffs] We'll go to my brother Antonio. Huh? [exhales] So? She was with Ciccio. [bangs] [bangs] Tell Maria to bring me the white shirt. Maria, where is your sister? At Auntie Carmela's. She went to get some flour. [sniggers] What a good daughter I have. [inhales deeply] She went to Auntie Carmela's to get some flour. I raised you properly. Bianca. Come here. What did Carmela say? That you never visit her. You're a whore. [thuds] You want for nothing in this house. I have a liar… …and a whore. [breathing heavily] Why that face? What? You don't like it? But when you make little 15-year-old girls take off their clothes in the stables… …you do like it. [crickets chirping] [footsteps approaching] [scoffs] [neighs] Hey. [neighs] Come. Hey. Hey. [exhales] I brought you this. I've wanted to give it to you for a week. But I can't read, son. It'll take me all day. Oh, then I can read it to you. First I want to show you something over here. We haven't had a year like this since before the war. This is a rich land. It only needs water. And thank God… …we have plenty of water here. In spite of all the heat we've had… …the soil is still moist. Yes, it is. [bangs] I know it's moist. It is moist! [thuds] [sighs] I warned you. More than once. You won't be saying another word. Not another word. [melancholy music playing] [gasps] - [screaming] No! - [man] Don't! Let's go! - Don't! Don't! - No! - Don't look! Don't look! - [screaming, crying] Don't! No! [crying] No, I beg you, no! [gasps] My Lord! [grunts] [screaming] [crying] [weeping] You are not my father anymore! You are no one! The thought of sharing your same blood makes me sick! [screaming] Ciccio! [crying] [eerie music playing] Antonio, Antonio, the manager wants to speak with you. [knocking] - Go ahead. - Thanks. - [manager] Come in, Antonio. - Sir. Good morning. [sinister music playing] [speaking indistinctly] - Hey. - Hey, Antonio. Dad invited us for dinner tonight. Okay. What's wrong? Antonio, what happened? My brother… My brother's dead. They killed him. [knocking] Who is that? I don't know. [knocking] One second! It's the Carabinieri! Open the door! [Mrs. Manolio] The Carabinieri!? What do they want at this hour? [busts open] - Come on. Let's go. - What happened? I didn't do anything wrong. What do you want? Get back here! Stop, now! Stop it, stop it! [somber music playing] [engine revving] [sighs] Antonio! - Mom. - Antonio. [crying] Can you believe it? Ciccio is gone. Ciccio is gone. [sobbing] Our Ciccio is gone. [crying] Antonio. Hey. [sobbing] It's just horrible. You'll see. They killed our Ciccio like an animal. I don't want to stay anymore, Antonio. I'll do whatever you want me to. I won't bother you. If you have a friend, anyone friend who will marry me, I'll do it. What are you talking about? [sobbing] - Lucia. - Antonio. Thank you, Antonio. [sniffles] Thanks for coming. [Mariella sobbing] [Ninetta] Here. Give this to Father Felice. Tell him he has to do a special service for our Ciccio. - Okay? - Okay. - Go. - [crying] Let's go, Lucia. We'll go and get some flowers and the candles. We'll be right back. [sniffles] For the love of God, where are you going? To see Ciccio. Bianca. [gasps] [breathing heavily] If you get any closer, I'll rip your belly open. [exhales] [women crying] [sobbing] [hammering] [women crying] [hammering] Antonio, no. We'll carry Ciccio. Linda, come. You too. Come on. [sad music playing] [church bell tolls] [crickets chirping] Good morning. [kids speaking indistinctly] Shoot. I'll save it. No, no! Come on, come on! - No! - Goal! I scored a goal. Terrible! - Nice! - Wait! Wait! I can make that, I can make that! Come on, come on! [brigadier] Anyway, the night before, your brother was here at the station for the assault of Don Luigi. After that, they saw him going home alone. That's all we know at the moment. [thuds] Up north, killing a spider is bad luck. You're not from here, are you? Listen, I ask the questions here if you don't mind. Then maybe you should be asking someone else, don't you think? We're doing our job. As soon as something comes up, we'll be sure to inform your family. Don't you worry. Have a good day. [Vincenzo] Antonio has nothing to do with it. He's Ciccio's brother. My brother, Pasquale, is in jail because of him! - Do you understand? - [Vincenzo] Enough! Thirty! Thirty men have ended up just like him! Do you hear me? He heard you. Enough now! - Get off me! - He heard you! Go on! The fucking "Paradiso" family. [Vincenzo] Get out of here! Go! [dog barking] Who's that guy? One of the women carrying the casket was his wife Rosina. He found her with Ciccio once. A shitstorm you can't even imagine. Antonio, I don't know if you knew, but your brother slept around. And Bianca? You know how many times I told Ciccio? "Forget it." Nothing. He'd lost his head. He wasn't thinking straight. Like Ciccio used to say, "Bianca is not a woman, Antonio." "She's a goddess." All right then. How did it go with the brigadier? Fine. It went fine. Thank you, Vincenzo. What now? They kill your son, and you won't say a word, do anything? Huh? Ciccio made a mistake. When you make a mistake, you pay. Even if it's my son. Ciccio was getting in their way. He gave people hope. And the last thing you should give people who have nothing, like us, is hope. It hurts more than it helps. To wage war with those criminals, Antonio, you must be like them. But Ciccio wasn't like that. I'm leaving tonight. On the coach. Antonio. Forget about this house, about these people, us, all of it. Don't ever come back. [busts open] Don't touch me! - Don't touch me! - Shut up! [screaming] [muffled shouting] [knocking softly] - I'd like to talk to your father. - He's sleeping. Really? Is he sorry for what happened to my brother? I told you he's sleeping. Besides, the Paradiso family isn't welcome in this house. We don't like how you smell. Do you want to know why? Because it's not a smell. It's a foul stench. You stink like those filthy people who don't know their place. If I were you, I'd be careful what you say. You can think whatever you want. I'm not afraid of people like you. The whole town knows the truth. Even the rocks. Oh, so everyone in town knows the truth? It's better this way. Everybody has to know. Your brother stuck his nose where he shouldn't have. Nobody can come to my house to bother my daughter. I raised her so that not even the flies could buzz around her. I'm sorry for your father. But this is the end that your brother deserved. Remember, kid, if you sow thorns, you can't walk barefoot. You take it out on these people who've been repressed into misery. Resigned to be crushed by people like you, eaten alive by your greed. You should learn how to enjoy your people's happiness, not their misery. This land is rich enough to satisfy everyone. Unfortunately, you can't understand that. You think you have power, but you're wrong. They have it. And as long as people like my brother die… …freedom will never die. - The law should... - The law. I hold the law here, in my hands. Now go, and say hi to your father before he loses two sons, instead of one. Cosimo, shut the door. And come inside. Be a good boy, hm? [kisses] Take him with you, Antonio. Away from this place. Before he becomes like us. Please. Lucia… - Don't cry. - [sobbing] [sniffles] Bye, Mom. [engine revving] Thank you, Vincenzo. [melancholy music playing] [sheep bleats] [horse grunting] [bangs] [thuds] [breathing heavily] [bangs] - [bangs] - [grunts] [bangs] [bangs] [banging] [dramatic music playing] POLICE [panicked breathing] [screaming] Maria! Maria! [gasps] [panicked breathing] They also killed Cosimo. [crying] Good morning. Can I have ten kilos of flour, please? I'm sorry, there's no more flour. We're out. You're sorry? And what's this? This is not for you. You didn't have any last time either. What's wrong? Our money isn't good? You have no flour. You have no sugar. You have no salt. You want to starve us to death? [Maria] Come on, let's go. - Hey. - Bianca! What are you doing? [somber music playing] [speaking indistinctly] [knocking softly] Hello? [Don Luigi] Oh, come in. Come on in. It's been so long. Come here. Have a seat. Have a seat. Come here, darling. Come. Oh, my… You know how many times I wanted to come to the farm? But since your father isn't around, I spend all my time in Matera. My office is there now. And I rarely come here into town. You have a beautiful house. Ah, the sacrifices… Years of sacrifices. But tell me, to what do I owe this visit? Do you need help? Just say it. I owe it to your late father, so anything you need from me. Don Luigi, the land we own is way too big. And after what happened, nobody wants to come work for us anymore. Hm. Hey, Caterina. Thank you. That's fine. [grunts] Here we go. Mmm. Try this. - It's really good. - No, thank you. Hm? Ah. Mm. Don't you worry. We'll take care of everything. You and your sister shouldn't worry. I'll send you one of my teams. You've grown so much. Huh? You've become beautiful. You and your sister were so little. [mumbles] How old are you now? So, you're going to send someone? - Mm-hmm. - I appreciate it. Consider it done. I was thinking… I'm going to… to Matera… Why don't you come with me? Huh? [gasps] If you will just behave yourself, you can have it easy the rest of your life. Come here. Come on. [screams] [groans] Caterina! Caterina! [machines whirring] - Are you good? - Can you give me a hand, please? Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I'll help you. [screaming] [workers speaking indistinctly] - He needs to get to a hospital! - Come on! Hurry up! - [screaming] - You're okay! You're gonna be okay! - [man 1] Slowly! - [man 2] Easy, easy! Easy! [sighs] [gasps] [exhales] [blows] [blows] [inhales] [sighs] [Bianca] God, it burns so much! What did the snake look like? It was huge. Black. Huh. Vincenzo, big and black. Well, then, uh… [Bianca grunts] …all we can do now is wait. - Wait? Wait for what? - Hm. My grandma used to say that when a snake bites you, you have two options, well… Yeah, you can either pour the milk of a woman on it… Do you have milk? Me? What's he talking about? Or you can suck the poison of the snake and spit it out, you know? That's gross. I know, but… Look, decide. Me or him? You. Mm. Vincenzo, hold this. - Can you please turn around? - Okay. You too, Vincenzo. Okay, hold on. - [Bianca] Ah. - What's your name? Bianca. [Ciccio] Ah, Bianca. Let me… Here we go. Close your eyes, though. - Close my eyes... - If you don't, it won't work. - It's here, right? - [Bianca] Yes. Okay, just let me find a better position. - [kisses] - [gasps] You damn dirty sleaze! [laughing] It's nothing. It's a four-lined snake. It's not poisonous. Hey, I saved your life. Don't forget that. You're with me every day. Always. Antonio! Hey. Have a look! [chuckles] - What do you think? - You're beautiful. [kissing] Come. I want to show you something. The apartment on the second floor. It's beautiful. Dad said if we like it, we can move in less than a month. Ah. Great. That's what we wanted, right? Yes. What's wrong? Nothing. Antonio, is everything all right? Yeah, everything is fine. Dad told me that you didn't go to the last factory meeting. - I know. - It's not like you. I know. It's just that… - Just what? - I couldn't make it. What's going on? You won't look at me or talk to me. What's going on? Tell me. There's nothing, really. I'm just a little shaken. I lost my brother, and I can't… You know. Over the years, you've become an important figure here, Antonio. For everyone. Thank you. We've known each other for over 20 years. If you need anything, to go away for a while… Don't worry. We have absolutely no problems with that. No, sir. No, I'm fine. - It was just an accident. - Don't worry about the accident. We'll take care of that. I'm worried about you, Antonio. No, truly. I can keep working. I am fine. - Are you sure? - Yes, I am. Okay. - I assure you. - Of course, of course. Thank you. Antonio. Yes? My daughter really cares about you. You have become part of our family. Please… Thank you. [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] ANTONIO PARADISO VIA ENRICO TOTI - TRIESTE - You know what I mean? - Yes, sir. - Who's there? - The usual. Let's go in. Let's go. [man] And seven! [Pietro] Hey, what's up, Antonio? - [Antonio] Hey! What's up? - How is it going? It's all good. - Hey. The usual beer? - Yeah, thanks, Michele. Totò, you wanna play or not? Maybe next time. Lorenzo will take my place. [Pietro] Ah, good! Maybe I'll finally win tonight! [Lorenzo] Who's going to win tonight? Come on. Show me how you win… [soft music playing] - Hello. - [old man] Hello. Want some? No, thanks. - [old man] Going to town? - Yes. Put your suitcase there. Go on. Thank you. [old man grunts] You're not from here, are you? You're from out of town? From the North, but I was born here. You need luck even when you're born. [somber music playing] [gasps] [inhales sharply] I missed you so much. - How are you? - [Antonio] Fine. [birds chirping] Good morning. [Maria] Good morning. Where's Bianca? [Maria] Come with me. In here. May I? Go ahead. Thank you. Sit. Uh, can I offer you a cookie? I made them. [footsteps approaching] My mom. She died very young. She was a good woman. No, thanks. Um… I'm going to call Bianca. Please be careful. You need to be patient with her. [door opens, closes] Where is Antonio? He left. But why? Dad, I've seen the photograph of Schettino's wife. It's the same as the one Mom found in your wallet, years ago. I remember it like it was yesterday. [Cenz] Antonio, Bianca's sister is my daughter. I grew up in Schettino's family. I was even his best man when he got married. Bianca was born a year later, and he went crazy. He became an animal. He wanted a boy, but… He started drinking, then beating his wife, poor Cesarina. Do you know how many nights she came to our house and slept there? And so… I've never had the courage to look Maria in the eyes. I've never forgiven myself for that. Does Mom know? Mm-hmm. [Cenz] Antonio. Do you know how Cesarina died? Suicide. [sighs] [drawer opening] [exhales] I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU ANTONIO PARADISO Paradiso. [soft music playing] [Bianca] Antonio! [panting] And so… are you going to tell me that important thing or not? I want to marry you now. Right now. [sighs] Close your eyes. [French song playing] [soft music playing] [man singing in Italian]
