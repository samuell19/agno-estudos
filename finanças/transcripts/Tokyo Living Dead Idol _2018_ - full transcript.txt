Yuririn, your singing was off. Huh? They'll realize you suck. What? You too, Moe. You're not keeping up with the dance. Really? Especially with the new dance. I still haven't perfected it yet. Then practice harder! Both of you... Stop wasting time eating snacks before the show! You really piss me off. What? Can't you do something about that? About what? Your attitude. Did you forget that I'm the leader? You do realize that I'm at center stage, right? Without me, Tokyo 27-ku would be finished. Yeah, but... That's not the point. This is a team effort. You guys don't get it! Sure it may be late-night on a local channel, but we're getting our own TV show! We have a shot at a concert at a big venue. We're no longer underground! Now's the time to really get it together. Don't you understand the situation we're in? It's make or break! Got it? I really mean it. No! No! Ow! No! It's a zombie! A zombie! That hurts! Yuririn! Moe! Help! Help! A zombie's got Miku! Somebody help! Please! I got this! ZOMBIE HUNTER R. IMAGA This is a hidden camera show, right? Tell me it is! Where's the camera?! He bit me. He really bit me! This can't be true. Tell me it's not true! I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die! I'm not going to die! 69 hours until I turn into a zombie. The Zombie Virus infects those bitten by zombies. There is an incubation period of approximately 72 hours. After that, the brain rots starting from the cerebral neocortex, turning the victim into a zombie. In Japan, victims are quarantined for 72 hours before being euthanized, for the sake of humanitarianism. However, some countries kill the victims immediately. Wonderful Detective Agency Wonderful Detective Agency We solve cases that others turn down I'm telling you that you must pay up. It's not my fault your wife cheated on you. Hey. Don't hang up on me. Pay up- Bastard! No wonder his wife cheated on him. I'm seriously broke. Seeped in Umami Seeped in umami... Seiran We have breaking news. There is a search warrant out for Miku Kamiya, 20 years old, a member of the pop idol group Tokyo 27-ku. Miku Kamiya was infected when a zombie bit her after her show today. She escaped while being transported to quarantine. Her whereabouts are currently unknown. The police have not made a statement regarding this matter so far, but it seems a police employee let her escape during transportation. No way. This can't be true. Miku? It can't be! Kamiya was in her stage costume at the time of her escape. Many sightings have been reported, but she has not been captured. The police are currently searching for her. The police employee involved in her escape is under interrogation, but is remaining silent. For real? Can't trust cops. What time do they think it is? Is this the Wonderful Detective Agency that'll handle any case? That's right. I need your help. I'm Miku Kamiya. I'm a member of the idol group Tokyo 27-ku. We've been appearing on TV recently... I-l know who you are. You were bitten by a zombie and you're wanted nationwide. Wanted nationwide?! Hey! You okay? Huh? Becoming a pop idol... was my late parents' dream. But I failed audition after audition. Even though I'm so cute. I have big boobs too. I finally got into a small-time group... but it's been tough. Our agency was small and inexperienced. We started from the lowest of the low. But I persisted. I never gave up and gave it my best! I finally made it this far! I can't die until I become a household name, and sing at top venues! I can't become a zombie! So please help me. This is all I have right now. But I promise to pay more later. You can take ten percent of my earnings once I return to being an idol. You'll no longer have to work as a cheap detective! Calm down. I feel for you. But once you're bit... Look at this. There's a clue in here for overcoming the virus. Discovery of the Century!! Frog-like Aliens Not that. Urgent Announcement Next issue preview of "The hidden truth. A cure for the zombie infection exists!" "The hidden truth." "A cure for zombie infection exists." No way. Magazines like this are full of crap. The police officer that helped me escape told me to look into it. He's a huge fan of mine. He's an inspector. So he must be reliable. For real? No way. I don't buy it. Come on. A popular idol is asking you. Guys would envy you. I prefer older women. I don't care much about young idols. I thought you solve cases that others would turn down. That's just a slogan. I beg you. I have no one else I can turn to. Fifteen percent. From your earnings. And I'll take your cash for expenses. Um... Might as well give it a try. I've got nothing else to do anyway. Thank you! "This phone number is currently not in use." Did they go under? That's not possible. That's the latest issue. Let's visit their office tomorrow. You fell asleep? Jeez. Since 1986, when zombie infection rapidly spread around the globe, over 70 million people have been infected. Today, 2 million people turn into zombies every year. However, there is still no cure. It is said that curing the virus is impossible, but... Hey. Are we walking there? It's good to walk. You don't have a car? Nope. I had the impression that detectives drive snazzy cars. Cars cost money. 59 hours until I turn into a zombie. I begin my search for a cure with an unreliable detective who usually investigates infidelity. This is the place. There's nothing here. Nothing. I'm late! Excuse me. Me? May I help you? We're looking for a publisher called Full Forest. Oh, they make weird magazines. That's the one. The office burned down a week ago from a gas explosion. I heard that all the staff died. They tore down the building right away. It wasn't in the news. Maybe not... Excuse me. Can I go now? I'm running late. Of course. Thank you. How could that be? Sure is shady. That's right. I want you to look into the Full Forest gas explosion. I also want info on the guy who wrote the zombie cure article. Home address would be great. I'm sure it won't be that hard. I want it as soon as possible. It's a little complicated. About the payment for this... I'm counting on you. Hey! Behind youl! Help! I need a weapon. A weapon. Get away! You okay? Why didn't you help me?! I couldn't find a weapon. I killed a zombie. Don't worry. He was dead to begin with. Wait... are zombies increasing in number? The government says so. Living in Tokyo, I hardly ever ran into real zombies. But I saw one two days in a row! They may be coming in from outside of Tokyo. What happened?! We were attacked by a zombie. Shut up. Yes, it's a zombie. That's not it. Look! It's Miku Kamiya! Oh, um... Y-you must be mistaken. I'm not her. You're not? Of course it's her! You're under arrest! Oh no. We better run. Don't hide behind me! Give it up! We're going to catch youl! Don't leave me! Wait! Stop. Hide here. Stop! Where'd they go? Keep going! I can't believe this. I get attacked by zombies... and now the police are after me. What did I do to deserve this? Informant K Yes. Hello? The gas explosion was no accident. It was deliberate. But the police won't investigate it. It's filed as an accidental explosion. Someone must be pulling some strings. So who wrote the article? It seems to be a reporter named Oishi. Keita Oishi. His address is... They killed this zombie. We lost sight of them down that street. Who is this man that was with her? We're investigating as we speak. We'll look into it too. No, you can trust that the police force will get her. You let a virus carrier escape and failed to catch her. The police requested our help in capturing Miku Kamiya. You've lost all our trust. You have a point. Zombie! Shoot him! There might be a zombie hangout nearby. Any deserted buildings? Just over there. Take me there. I'll take them out. Who is that high school girl? An elite zombie hunter. But she's so young. She's been hunting zombies with her parents since she was a kid. Really? Her father is the chairman of the Zombie Hunters Association too. Seriously? Let's go. Crazy people who love to hunt zombies have formed groups all over the world. In Japan, we have the Japan Zombie Hunters Association. It is a citizen's group of zombie hunting fanatics. But they're actually a quasi-public lobby group that works with the government. Zombie hunters that are members of this association are permitted to carry weapons such as firearms and swords. At times, the police turn to them... to kill zombies and track down virus carriers. ZOMBIE HUNTER KISARAGI What a rush. Miku Kamiya, I will find you. Oishi Just as I expected. He was your fan. He would've never imagined that you'd be visiting in person. But... he was killed, right? Thank you. Hey. There's something behind this. Who is she? "The miraculous zombie beauty." "Her blood is a cure for the Zombie Virus?" For real? 55 hours until I turn into a zombie. We decide to look for this zombie beauty first. My story is unfolding like a dark, mysterious fantasy. What are you doing? I'l have her checked out. You can do that? Using facial recognition. That sure sounds useful. It must be easy being a detective nowadays. It's just more efficient. Miku must be trembling in fear right about now. Where could she be? What can we do? We're so powerless. We should go save her. Are you being serious? Yes. But how will we do that? How will we find her? Let us believe in the force. We'll pray and search for her presence. Didn't you become one with Miku at her shows? You said that you felt her force there. I said that. I felt her force. I think it'd be possible to find her if we really focus. You might be right. I have a feeling this is possible. Right? Shall we do it? Let's. The force is with us. Thundersnake. Let's go. Romance! Hacking into the police database... and running a photo through their facial recognition system. This is a serious crime. Tokyo 27-ku will be going on hiatus until we settle the problem about Miku. We apologize to our fans and involved parties. We also apologize to the public for the commotion that we have caused. We are very sorry. They don't have to apologize. It's called being a team. Has Miku been in contact with you? No, she hasn't. Some claim that your agent let her escape to create media hype. That is absolutely not true. How dare they. How do you feel about her escaping when she knows she's infected? Well... Are you aware that her selfish act has posed a threat to society? Yes, I am aware of that. Is there anything you want to say to her? Miku. Why are you not contacting us? We can't let that argument be our last conversation. Even if the whole world turns against you, we will always be on your side! Yuririn. Moe. I'm so sorry. Thank you. I was always so selfish. I was terrible towards you two. I'm going out. What do you want for dinner? A beef bowl. Extra beef, extra sauce. And... lots of bananas. Bananas? It said online that bananas help slow down the virus. Sounds sketchy... Hey. Miku Kamiya's autograph. And here is her breath. You're really fine with that? You can't pay me, right? No. Then this will do. I owe you. Here. I'm not doing this for you. It's for Miku. Alicia Semyonova. A no-name Russian model. She was bitten while in Japan. Zombie hunters captured her and took her to quarantine. However, there are no records of Alicia at quarantine. Why not? Zombie hunters sometimes don't take victims to quarantine. They send them elsewhere. Elsewhere? Where? For what? To use them as guinea pigs. This mad scientist named Dr. Kumozawa runs the research. He cultures organs using zombies, and develops new breeds of zombies like livestock. All under the Zombie Hunters Association. The association? The details are in that file. This is as far as I can help you. I know this is for Miku, but I could get killed for this. Like that reporter. The association is like a cult. You better watch your back. Thanks again. Headquarters (43rd floor) Any progress on finding that idol? Not yet. But I have leads. We must find her before the police at all costs. Failure is not an option with all hunters in Tokyo on her trail. However, it is my personal wish for my daughter to capture her before anyone else. Yes, Father. I'll find her. I just spoke to the prime minister and the governor of Tokyo. We want to use this chance to convince the public that a virus carrier on the loose is a threat to society. That they must be killed, just like zombies. Japan is too caught up with victims' rights. We're wasting tax money on quarantine facilities. No need to quarantine victims. Just kill them as soon as they are infected! This is the best approach. Hurry up and eat the beef bowl before it gets cold. I will. And? And Kumozawa was fired from the university, so the Zombie Hunters Association gives him funds and a lab. But what for? Because zombies are profitable. New zombies will add excitement to the hunt. It will make their position stronger. That's awful. At the lab, Kumozawa accidentally succeeded. In creating a miraculous zombie whose blood is a cure for the virus. Great discoveries are a product of chance. I succeeded in creating a cure for zombie infections. Though only tested on one person, the results are undeniable. A cure for zombie infection exists. But the cure will not be publicized. If it is, there will be no more zombies to hunt. The association will lose their power. It's madness. What about the government? They must have a part in this too. Maybe they're developing zombies for warfare. But they need insurance, so they're holding Alicia. When the time comes, they'll approve the cure and mass produce it. They'll make a fortune. She's held captive until then. That's just wrong. Why do crazy people like that have power? The power is what made them crazy. Poor Alicia. I have no idea where the facility she's being held at is. Full Zombie Virus Infection in hours 35 hours until I become a zombie! We don't know where Alicia is, but the zombie hunters are after me. I need to run! THE FOUR GREATEST ZOMBIE HUNTERS Miku is a zombie idol Tokyo 27-ku is finished She was bit by a zombie Alicia, where are you? Please. Somebody tell me. Full Zombie Virus Infection in hours Hey. What time is it? Just past 11 PM. How many more hours? 20 hours. 20 hours? Is that all I've got left?! We just have to keep searching. I am! I'm looking all over! Calm down. Where the heck is Alicia?! Take it easy. How could 1?! Oh, that's right. This isn't your problem. Humans are alone. Always alone! I'm going to die all by myself! But I'll no longer be human! I'm sorry. Look. We're all smiling. But we had a fight right before the photo shoot. It's nothing new. Yuririn got so mad. Moe was moping. It's not right. But... That's how the three of us made it this far. Hey. There's somewhere I want to go. Full Zombie Virus Infection in hours It's no good. We can't find her. We'll never be Jedi Knights. That's not true. So where are we? You don't know? No. There is a stage here soaked with Miku's blood, sweat, and tears. Miku dreamed of becoming a big star. Day after day she came here... ...to practice singing and dancing. This is where her youth lies. That's right. Miku might show up here, wanting to revisit her past memories. Not bad. Great thinking, my dear Watson. Right? I felt it. The force? No, a connection. A connection? Yes, a connection. Not the force? It was a connection. An overflowing Impulse Makes my Heart rush Take a jump Make a wish Get the break Never give up Yes, come and let it go Let it go Carry on down the path you believe in So take me to the stage Where I can shine brightly Open up That closed door It's time to break out right now And you break it again Big-boobed Babyface So break it again Big boobs! Babyface! Babyface! Big boobs! 8IG-BOOBED BABYFACE LOVIN' What's going on? Who the hell are you? Stay away! You are already dead. Zombies! Help! I need a weapon. H-help me! This way! Over here! What's with them? They're extremely excited. Now's our chance! What now? I finally found you, Miku Kamiya. A zombie hunter. Are you here to kill Miku? What? Kill me? There's no way I would kill you! I want to help you! I found you in time. Help me? I'm your biggest fan. Since before you made it big. See? Seriously? It's been a while, hasn't it? I remember you! Really? I'm flattered! You used to come to all our shows. I was having family problems back then. Tokyo 27-ku was what helped me get through. You always cheered me up. You have no idea what that means to me. But I hadn't seen you around lately, so I thought that you got tired of us. It made me feel so sad. No, I'll always be your fan. I've just been busy since I became a zombie hunter. My father is strict too. I understand. Anyway, we better hurry. Hurry? You're looking for Alicia, right? I know where she is. What? You know where she is? Really? That's amazing! Wait. Why would a girl like you know about Alicia and her whereabouts? I'm a top-class hunter and an executive. I'm also the daughter of the chairman. The chairman's daughter? For real? So is it true that Alicia's blood is a cure? It was proven on me 6 months ago. What?! I was bitten during combat. But look. For real? Are there any side effects? Let's just get going. Full Zombie Virus Infection in hours Shall we? Let's go! Did you get it? Let me see. Wow. Very nice! Perfect. Can I see? Whoa... You know how to use that? Yeah. I used to be a cop. Really? So the zombie lab is under a government building, huh? Right under your nose, right? It was built as a shelter, but the association bought it for quite a bargain. How do we get in? We can't just waltz in there. There's a secret passage in a nearby park. Wow... Can we trust you? It's not a trap? Don't worry, buddy. Buddy? All my fans are good people. I swear to Miku Kamiya and Tokyo 27-ku that I'm trustworthy. Miku. I want to make sure. About what? Alicia is under heavy security. I don't think Dr. Kumozawa will hand her over just like that. If he calls for help, the police and hunters will be after us. I have no other choice. It all ends today anyway. Otherwise, I have no tomorrow. We're not very popular yet. But we will perform each day as if it were our last. We'll sing with all our heart. From a small corner in Asia. From underground Tokyo. We spread our love to the world. Let's do this. Something's not right. What is it? There are no guards. What is this?! The guards. What happened? I have no idea. Dr. Kumozawa too. Laboratory 2 Live Video Who are they? They're onto us already? That's not possible. Four special test subjects revolted against us. This is a marvelous achievement. Unlike primitive zombies, they are not driven only by appetite. They take sophisticated actions based on their own will. They are after Alicia. They want to destroy the cure. They dream of a world ruled by zombies! No way. How could a zombie like that exist? Dr. Kumozawa specializes in neuroscience. He must've altered their brains. He's mad. This was 30 minutes ago. We better hurry. Alicia is at the end of the corridor. Specimen Storage Room Have you opened the door to Alicia's room? N-not yet. Hurry. We have intruders. I-intruders? Nothing to worry about. But hurry. Unlock the room and get rid of Alicia. B-but I am a slow, incompetent engineer. I'm not very bright... Do it or I kill you! Understood. What a slave driver. Well, a zombie driver in this case. "Valkyrie." This is bad. What is this? They're calling for zombies. So many! For real? Let's get them. I'm ready. My heart is racing. My muscles are trembling! I feel alive! It's amazing to be alive! I showed them. I'm pretty strong. Don't get full of yourself. There's still a lot to come. I thought my life was over when I got bit, but it's actually a rush. Now I can kill humans openly. What'd she say? Like I'd know. Go. Let me handle this. Got it. You got this. You're quite confident. But can you handle me? I used to be a zombie hunter myself. I'm going to have fun killing you. Another weirdo... Watch out! Keep your distance. You're kidding. It worked. It's over. But I had fun. I'm sorry. Cheater...! Kill it! I'm trying! We did it. You did good. This is a problem. I'm getting such a rush from this. Don't be stupid. Maybe I should become a zombie hunter. What's wrong with you? You're getting violent. Could be the initial symptom. What? Are you serious? Quit wasting time. Let's get going. No! Humans must be taught their place. Help me get up. But... Just do it. I don't know why you're here, but I will eradicate you. For real? You're nothing but a zombie. We lost our intelligence when we turned into zombies. But... Just go. But we are special zombies that have regained intelligence! What a fool. I won't die for nothing! I unlocked it. Alicia? I'm saved. Alicia? Where will Alicia be safe? There's a private lab in Kyoto that we can trust. But now we can't hunt zombies anymore. It was inevitable. But there are many more zombies, and the world is large. What was that monster? Yuririn? Moe? Miku! Miku! What's going on? After reading this, we had to come and help. Heading out to find a cure. If 1 don't make it back, take care of Tokyo 27-ku. You'll make it the best group ever! It has to be the three of us. She's right.
