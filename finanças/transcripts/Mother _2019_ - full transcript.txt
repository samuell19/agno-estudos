For you, 2:00 means 1:50. Yes, but we're going to be late, aren't we? Give me ten minutes to change. Ten minutes, ok, alright. Otherwise, everything is going to be full. Could you close the door, dear? This is my house, Mom. Do you have any cold water? No, you don't. Here we go. You're going to dinner tonight? Yes. With whom? With Lucía and Vero. And other people, but I don't think you know them. Men? Yes, men, Mom. Pour me some water. Friends... Mom, yes, friends. Ok. -Male friends. -Tell me who. -I don't know. -I don't know them? I'm sure I've talked about them. Nacho, remember that guy we ran into outside the theater? Hey, that boy is very handsome, isn't he? -Very sweet. -And very tall. There's nothing there? Nothing with Nacho? Well, we're friends. You don't like him? He is dating Lucía. What do men see in Lucía? You were saying? Nothing. Many men like Lucía, for example, Nacho. I didn't say anything, honey. How is it going with that girl? With... You haven't told me anything. Very good, very sweet, we get along well. She gets along great with Iván. What was her name? -Isabella. -Isabella. How "bella", Isabella! "Li ricordi, amore mio". Your phone is ringing. -Mine? -Yes. Ramón. -Great. -Hello? Mom? Iván, honey! How is it going? How are you? Having fun, sweetie? Good. Good? Where are you today? What are you doing? At the beach. At the beach! So, it isn't raining today? -No. -I want to talk to him, ok? So your dad will teach you to surf. But don't go far into the water. -And tell him to bundle you up, ok? -Ok. Are you going to use that little board you got? The one you like so much? Honey? Iván, talk to me. What are you doing? -Are you going to eat now? -I don't know. You'll have to eat something. What about your dad? -I don't know. -What do you mean you don't know? I don't know where he is. Iván, you don't know where your dad is? He left. He left? Where did he go? He said he'd be right back, but he isn't here. But did you go with any friends? Are you with other people? No. You didn't go with anyone? Are you alone on the beach, Iván? Yes. When did he leave? Has it been a long time? I don't know, a while. Yes, honey, but 10 minutes? Or more? I don't know, about that long. Iván, where did your dad go? To the camper. If he went to the camper, he's nearby, right? Where did you park the camper, do you remember? In the woods, we walked for a while. Why did he go to the camper? Because I forgot my toys. -And he went to get them. -Yes. And he left you alone. Why isn't he coming back? Honey, don't worry, I'm sure he's almost there. Are there a lot of people at the beach? Tell me who is close to you. There's no one here. -You don't see anyone? -No. -Iván, the beach is empty? -Yes. -He's alone? -What beach are you at? I don't know, a beach. Mom, call Dani. Dani Ceballos is his name, Ramón's friend. Honey, do you remember the name of the beach? No. Honey, give me his number. Honey, do you remember if you're in France? Or still in Spain? In France, I think. In France. Very good. Do you remember the name of a town or a beach you've gone past? Irun. Yes, honey, Irun. But Irun is in Spain. You said you were in France, right? Yes. Concentrate, Iván. Look around you. Are you sure you don't see anyone? No, I don't see anyone. Let's play I Spy, ok? Remember that game? You start. Iván, it's your turn. You start, I spy... -I spy... -What do you spy? -A thing. -What thing is it? A thing that starts with "wa". With "wa"? Are you looking at the water? Listen, honey, don't go up to the shore. Promise me you won't go in until dad gets there, ok? -Ok. -Deal? I'm here with Grandma. She's dying to talk to you. I'm going to pass you to her. Don't hang up and don't get in the water. -Ok. -I love you. He isn't picking up. Hello, sweetie. Hello? Natalia, hi, it's Elena, Ramón's ex. Natalia? Hello? Yes, what is it? Sorry to bug you, but it's an emergency. -Are you with Ramón and Iván? -No. -Do you know where they are now? -They were travelling... Yes, travelling to the Basque Country and then to France. You're not with them? It's important, about Iván, it has nothing to do... Honey, he wants to talk to you. You haven't seen them in the past few days? Know where they might be? No, I haven't talked to him in days. Do you know if they're with Dani or another friend? I don't know, I don't think so. Is something wrong? It's Iván, he can't find his dad. If you think of a way to contact them, let me know. -Yes, of course. -Thank you. If he calls, I'll let you know. I'll put Mom on. Kisses. Bye. -Who was that? -Mom, call the police. A friend of Ramón's. Call the police. -Hi, sweetie. -Mom? Honey, it's ok, I'm here. We'll keep talking until dad gets there. He'll be there soon, so don't worry. -Ok. -I'm going to send you a message. I need you to tell me if you get it. It's very important. Also, this morning, when you left the camper, going to the beach... Were there more cars in the parking lot? Did you walk with other people? Did you see other kids, other families? I don't remember. Honey, is your battery dying? Can you see the bars on the phone? In the battery at the top, how many bars are left? Hang on. There's one left. Did you get the message, Iván? No. I am going to hand you to Grandma again, ok? Don't worry. One second, love. His battery is low. -What? -Hello? Hello? -Hello? Who is this? -It turns out my son is alone on a beach in France. I don't know exactly where, I think it's near Hendaye or Saint-Jean-de-Luz, but I'm not sure. Your son doesn't know what beach it is, right? My son is six years old, he's travelling with his dad in a camper. Last night, they were in Hendaye. Now his dad isn't there, he says he doesn't see him. He called me with his cell and he's low on battery. I don't think he has data in France. Ok, I understand. One moment, ma'am. Can you track the call, please? First, the father didn't tell him the beach or the area? I told you he doesn't know where he is. Otherwise I wouldn't be calling. So what phone is he using to call? Yes, his dad's phone. Should I give you the number? One second, yes, give me the number. It's 696... -Ok, one second, 696... -68 10 15. Can you trace the call? One moment, ma'am, please don't hang up. -What happened, Mom? -The call cut out. Hello? Hello? Yes, I am back. Listen, the call with my son cut out. Can you send a patrol or something? In any case, you would need to come and file a report. I have to go there to file a report? Yes. Ok, maybe I didn't explain myself. Look, one moment, let me explain, my son is alone on a beach, he is only six, ok? I think he's in France. His dad is gone, maybe something happened because he should be there, understand? It's winter, it will be dark in three hours. I don't know if you can trace the call, I gave you the number. Yes, ma'am... Can't you trace the call? We can't trace the call... I'll go file a report later, but can't we get moving? They were in Hendaye last night, ok? They must be close. They must be... I don't know. We can call the police there, your colleagues, to start looking for them... He's a kid, he's terrified. -He's alone. Hello? -Yes. But I'm telling you that's not how we do it. You have to come file a report. So the only option you're giving me is to go there and file a report. -That's my only option. -Ma'am, please calm down. No, you're incredibly helpful. Incredibly helpful! -What is it? -Are you calling? -Voicemail. -What happened? I don't know, it cut out. What did they say? Do you have to go... Nothing. They didn't tell me anything. Do you have to go and file a report? -Dammit. -What do we do? Where are the car keys, Mom? I'm going to find him. You're going? But honey... To France? You stay here, Iván knows the landline. Honey, you don't know where he is. -Mom, I'm not staying here. -If you knew where he was... You should know about these things, but... Honey, you don't... I don't know about these things, shut up! The phone! Iván! Iván! Honey, are you ok? What happened? I don't know... Honey, it's ok, ok? Calm down, everything's fine. Mom is here. Breathe, sweetie, stop crying or I can't understand you. Calm down, ok? Honey, it is very important the phone doesn't cut out, you hear me? Ok, how is your battery? Why isn't Dad coming back? Sweetie, Dad's almost there, you just have to be a little patient, ok? You're doing great. Honey, I need you to precisely describe the beach you're at, ok? From where you are, do you see the end of the beach? No. Ok, if you look both ways... Remember one day we talked about left and right? Yes. Yeah? On the left, what do you see? Do you see trees? What do you see? There are rocks. Rocks, very good. And what is on the right? Sand. Ok, honey, if you walk on the sand, who knows what you'll find, right? Ask about a bar... Is there a bar or a house, honey? Something nearby? Iván, this morning when you went from the camper to the beach, did you pass a house or bar? Was there anything? Think hard. -No. -No what? There's nothing. There's nothing. Honey, calm down, honey. It's ok, you know what you're going to do? You're going to walk, ok? No, honey, no... -Walk to the right. -Honey... On the sand, always the same way. Don't lose sight of... It's always better to stay put. It is, trust me. He has to find someone. His battery's dying. -Listen to me. -Mom... Listen, please. Yes, my love. Yes, my love, yes. There's a man. -There's a man where? -There's a man? There. What does he look like? I don't know. Is he alone or is he with someone? He's alone. Ok, and what is he doing? He's peeing. Did he see you, Iván? Yes, he's looking at me. He's saying to come closer. Mom, I don't want to go. Stay still, honey. Stay there. He's a stranger. Calm down, it's ok. You're talking to Mom, it's ok. He's coming over. He's telling me to come closer. What do I do? -Run. Run! Iván, run. -Why? You're a good runner, you'll do great. You have to run as fast as you can, you hear? -Why? -When he can't see you, make sure he can't and you hide, ok? Honey, are you running? Run, honey! Run! Are you running? What's happening? Iván, say something, please. Iván, please, tell me you're ok. Honey? Honey? Sweetie... Iván, say something. Honey... Mom, I'm hiding. Where are you hiding? Under a tree trunk. Where's the man? He's looking for me. Be very quiet. Be quiet, don't make any noise. Don't talk and listen closely. My battery's dying. If that man finds you... Listen to me. If that man finds you, you tell him Mom and Dad are right there. Ok? That we'll be there in a minute. Do you hear me? It's important you say that, honey. -My battery's dying. -Do you hear me? The man is here. Tell him what I said, ok? He saw me. Iván, tell him what I said, please! Did it cut out? What is it? What did he say? Don't touch me! 10 YEARS LATER Speed it up back there. Here you are. Everything ok? -Yes, everything's fine. Thank you. -You're welcome. Eric. Goodnight, get some rest. -See you tomorrow, Julie. -See you. -See you, Hubert. -Bye, Caro, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Are you hungry? Stop doing that every time we eat. Stop! -Ok, ok, relax. -Yes. Ok. We need silverware. I'm coming. There isn't anything hot? Yes, it's almost done. Who wants salad? Do you want salad? Not much for me. You have to have some salad. Who took my fork? -I didn't touch it. -What? Look, now the napkin's dirty. Go on, eat. -I... -I said eat. Go on, eat your salad. Sorry. Joseba called you. What are you doing here? We finished early. I thought you were coming tomorrow. Wonderful. That was fast. I'm cold. You shouldn't have to drive at night. When we live together, I won't have to drive as far. Hello. Can I order? Yes. A coffee, please. Any milk? No, thank you. Can I sit there? Thank you. I've never eaten here. My parents say it's a tourist trap. I'm not a tourist. Is the food good here? Well, it's not bad... But would you eat here? That's what matters. Miss, I'll leave the money here. Coming. -Thank you. -See you. It's funny, I had a friend who worked in a restaurant on weekends and he told us he saw things in the kitchen... I won't go into detail because it might offend you, but it wasn't a pretty picture. At least the coffee is good. Can I get another? -Another? -If it's not too much to ask. Of course. You aren't French. Spanish? -Yes. -Really? Did you know I speak Spanish? Well, I'm learning at school. -But... -Elena, I'm taking a smoke break. Like... My dad wanted me to study German, but I think it's an awful language. I love when he's wrong. My name is Jean. What's yours? I know your name is Elena, he just said it. How are you? Good, and you? Not very good, but thanks for asking. What are you hobbies? None? My favorite thing is eating. Eating, listening to music, girls too. And soccer. In that order. My skills also rank in that order. Actually, I don't know if you're interested, but we're playing against Biarritz on Saturday. So if you want to witness my public humiliation, you can come to the central beach at five. Saturday... I can't. Another time, then. How much is the coffee? Two fifty. That makes five. Can I have your phone number? I don't have one. If you don't want to give it to me, just say so. I won't start crying. What is your address? Excuse me? You have to tell me so we're even. Why? You know where I live. I saw you following me. Am I making you uncomfortable? No, no... I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. Honestly, it's been a long time since something that cool has happened to me. See you tomorrow. The weather will be nice tomorrow. -Good morning. -Good morning. How are you? Good. This is almost ready. The peppers... I promised it would be sunny, and it will be sunny. And he starts eating the whole cheese... Some cheese, maybe a reblochon... He puts it in his mouth... And it starts coming down... Deranged, like he was insane. With spasms, like... -Yeah, yeah. -No, no... And he was also so witty... No, no, Dad has those moments when... Those things were amazing. At first, you didn't know... Since he was so serious... With that look he had... But your mom too, buying so much cheese... Well, she had her reservations with people. Where are you going? To the bathroom. Elena? In here. What are you doing? I want to go home. Did something happen? -No, no... -Did someone say something? -Nerea or... -No, they're all great. I'd rather be there. I'm sorry. Ok, I'll take you to the bus stop. -Don't worry, I can walk. -No, it's no trouble. I'll say the restaurant called or something. Keep an eye on your phone tomorrow, ok? Come on. Thank you. Hello. You came. Did you see when I fell down? -Yes. -Well, shit. -Jean, are you coming or what? -Coming. Did you hurt your foot? Yeah, I did. Look, it's really bad. I have no choice, they're all barefoot. In fact, they must have man feet. Have you tried picking up a pencil with your toes? -Why? -To strengthen them. Maybe I will. Here. Are you coming? -Hello. -Hello, how is it going? -Grégory -Elena. Which one is yours? None. -No? -No. Do you like beach soccer? Not particularly. Well, I don't know what to say. Dad, are we in a hurry? No, no hurry at all. Want to come to a picnic with us? I don't know... Just for a little while. Just a little while. Ok, just a little while. Right over there. -Cool. -Ok. -Are you happy? -Yes, I am. If we're in Bordeaux, we'll buy some more. A nice chateau... This cheese pairs really well, doesn't it? How did it go? Did you get it? -Hey, Benji. -Yes, great. Hi! So, did you guys win? Yeah, even though I played. -Hi, I'm Léa. -Elena. This is Benjamin. I don't think we've met. I don't think so. Are you the mother of one of Jean's friends? No, she's Jean's friend. Oh, great. Did you see the Zeppelin? It was beautiful. She doesn't get it and it kills her. What did you say? Just an inside joke. See? He can speak it if he wants to. I think I'll get a glass of wine. Where is it? -I'll go with you. Are you coming? -Come, Benjamin. They couldn't be any more bourgeois. -Want one? -No. -Who's that? -Who? The blonde over there. A whore. Why are you insulting her? I don't know. What would you call a girl who this summer says she can't live without you then hooks up with another guy? -A normal girl. -It's bullshit. She still likes you. That's bullshit too. -Shit. -See? -You're from Paris, right? -Yes. Yes, my parents bought a house here. And they made me come. -But you have other friends? -Yeah, don't worry. Do you really not have a phone? Yeah, but I don't know how to use it. Really? Nowadays everyone uses a phone. Even beggars are on their phone all day. Do you have a pen? A pen? No. So pens aren't your thing either. Don't move, I'll be right back. I got some for you, here. Thanks. Where did Jean go? -Jean? I don't know. -There. Did you see who he is with? -Yeah. -He's so cute. It's funny, even after a year. You think she likes him? Yes, I'm sure. Well, I must be going. We can introduce you if you want. -No, that's fine. -See you later. -Goodbye. -Bye. Elena. Are they watching us? -Yes. -Give me your hand. See you tomorrow. The next day, as I get closer, I see the gendarmes are there. Why? -It turns out... -What is it? Jean Baptiste... had caught another farmer adding herbicide... to the irrigator. Why? He declares his love for his wife, but he was screwing the other guy's wife. Wait, Jean Baptiste was screwing the other farmer's wife? -Exactly. -And the other farmer got revenge. Crazy, huh? How are you? -Good. -Was it a tough week? -Don't look. -The psycho from the beach. How is Olivier? -The woman behind us. -Who? The crazy woman from the beach. The Spaniard who lost her son. Good. She wasn't there when he disappeared. Did she hear us? Do you want to leave? -I'll pay at the bar and we'll go. -Thank you. You can wait outside if you want. I can't this week. How do you want me to do that? I work all day. What can I do? That's the way it is. Next time, for sure. -You just have to talk to... -Eric. Eric! -Hang on. -Please, we're swamped. Sorry. I'll call you later. Elena, here. Table 7 has just arrived. -Elena? -Coming. The order for table 3, please. -Hello. -Today's impossible. -Is this for table 3? -Table 3, yes. Thanks. -Should I leave? -I don't know. Should I come back tomorrow? -Is that good? -Thank you. Coming. Everything ok? Yes, but we're swamped. I meant you, are you ok? Yes. -Good evening. -Good evening. Are you busy? I just finished. Jean, this is Joseba. Nice to meet you. A pleasure. Would you like something? It depends, if you're staying, yes. Otherwise, no. It's not necessary. I'm headed out. We’re going home. We'd invite you for dinner, but I'm exhausted. I'll change and we can go, ok? Ok. If you want something, Julie is there. Are you from around here? No. Jacques? -Jean. -Jean! -Did he leave? -Yes. He said he was a regular customer and left. Ok. -Goodbye, Julie. -See you tomorrow. Goodnight. Who was that? A friend. Well... he's not a friend. I used to be a regular customer too, remember? Elena, a table of Spaniards just arrived. Can you take them, please? On my way. You didn't come in? No, I prefer to wait for you outside. You can come in whenever you want. Ok. Are you going home? Yes. If you accompany me, we can chat. Perfect. What did you do today? Today? This morning I went surfing on the beach with my brother. After that we had lunch, I took a nap, and then I went out with some people. I went home, had a shower, ate, and now here we are. You aren't going out with your friends? Tonight? Maybe later. Not a bad life, huh? Not bad, no. You have to enjoy it. -In Paris we work too much. -Oh really? -No, not really. No, but it's always raining. It's much better here. What did you do today? -Me? -Yes. Worked, ate, went for a walk on my break, went back to work and now here I am. And now you'll have dinner with... Joseba isn't here, he's working. -Is he your boyfriend? -Yes. Ok, because I wasn't completely sure, but now I am. Elena. You know the other day, when I asked how you were, it was because... Because? I don't know, if you need to talk, you just... Jean, I don't want to talk about anything. Sorry. This is me. Ok. Have fun. See you tomorrow. IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE USING YOUR PHONE Elena, your friend. -Hello. -Hello. What's going on? We're closed on Sunday afternoon. Don't you have a house? I'm out. -Later, boss. -See you tomorrow. What a funny guy. So, that means... you're free? We can go to the beach. I was planning on having lunch at home. Come on! Trust me, I'll take you somewhere you'll love. Ok, give me five minutes. I'll wait outside. Want some help? No, don't worry. I'll just heat this up. Put your things there. -I only have water. -Don't worry. My mom always says I'm a fat soul in a skinny body. Want some more? -Is there more? -Yes. Thank you. -Do you live here all year? -Yes. With your boyfriend? No, this is my house. He sometimes stays here for work. Thank you. I thought they only rented these apartments in the summer. Did you negotiate a good price? -Pretty good, yes. -Well played. What is winter like here? Not many people and it's really cold. Well I'll see you at Christmas. I won't be here. You're moving? When? Soon, at the end of the season. To where? Close to San Sebastián. With your boyfriend? Then come visit me in Paris. Maybe, but I've already been there. How many times? Once. With your boyfriend? With an ex. An ex... What was he like? Do you have photos? No, I don't. Should we watch TV? Sure. Hello? I didn't know you were coming. I called you. We were watching a movie. Remember Jean? We agreed you'd check your phone. I forgot. -Hello. -Hello. It's off, Elena. -How are you? -Good. I'll head out. -See you tomorrow. -Goodbye. -See you. -Bye. Can I turn it off? Sure. Want some coffee? Did you eat here? -He's sweet. -I'm sure. We agreed you'd start checking your phone. You also didn't check your email. I haven't had much time, honestly. -You got an email. -I'll check it tomorrow. It's important. How important? I don't know, relax. You can check it tomorrow. Ok. Are you sure everything is ok? Yes, fine. Olivier! I don't know where the decorations are. -I think that's them. -Yes. I'm going to use the computer, ok? -Ok, no problem. -Thanks. -I'll be right there. -Ok, but please hurry. HI ELENA, I'LL BE IN THE PYRENEES NEXT WEEK. I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU. IF YOU WANT, I CAN COME TO YOU OR WHEREVER WORKS BEST. HOPE YOU'RE WELL. RAMÓN. Hand me the tape. Thank you, Olivier. -Can I have this dance? -Sure. How's it going? Having fun? Yes, how about you? What? I'm dying for you to come. Come on, come on, dance! Come on! What ideas? That's the question. -Man and his ideas. -Good grief... No, but it's a consequence. What he says is logical. Logic within madness. You have to accept it. I won't accept that. I'm willing to listen. You know I have my convictions. Another beer? -Ok. -Shall we? -Another round? -Yes. -One, two, three... A shot? -Yes. Olivier gets more right-wing each day. Look, your friend. Hey, how's it going? Hi, how's it going? Very well. -Doing well? -Yes. -These are my friends. -Nice to meet you. -Francis and Marie. -Hello. Nice to meet you. You can have our spot. You're leaving already? Yeah, it's really crowded. We're going to the beach. Oh, great. Have fun. -Thanks. -Thanks, bye. -Have a good night. -Good night. Four, five, and a shot. A shot. Five beers and a vodka shot, please. -You say... -That's it. I'm getting too old for this. But you're such a good dancer. Want to head out? -I think I might stay a while. -Really? Do you mind? I don't know. I'm surprised. Have fun. You're still here? -See you tomorrow. -Later. Hey! You're drunk. So are you. But I'm an adult. Good for you. Are you coming with us? Your friends won't like that. Screw them. Come on. That's the question! For example, do you prefer... Do you prefer one good night or a hundred bad ones? You'll want more. -Yeah, but that's impossible. -That depends. Look, he's getting nervous. He is fully aware he doesn't know anything and prefer to do it many times. -Yes. -Ok, sure. Let's directly ask the guy in question. -Once or more? -Go on, explain yourself. Once? But we don’t agree. We’ll talk about it later. And you, Jean? How many times do you need? I can't even count. Even if you were bad, you wouldn't have kids. You, Caroline, do you prefer once but doing it well, or several times but not as good? I prefer doing it once and doing it well. Yeah, yeah. You, Elena? Which do you prefer? Me? Many times to have an orgasm. I'll be right back. Where are you going? -You like vodka, right? -Yeah. I'll be back. Wait up, I'm coming! Welcome. Let's see... The vodka... Are you the owner? No, I'm the manager. But you're in charge. -You're from Madrid, right? -Yeah, come here. What do you want? -How old are you? -Me? I'm 39. What do you want? Tequila. Mezcal is better. What about salt and lemon? Try it like this. -Cheers! -Cheers! You have to savor it. Yeah. You're Jean's ex, right? And you're the nut from the beach. Yep... I knew it. How's it going? Great, why? Just asking. Everyone else went home. -Already? -Yeah, they were cold. I came to find you. We'd be fine on our own. Yeah, but I wanted to be sure you got bourbon. Do you have any? There, in the box. You could have sent a message. Yeah, but she doesn't have a phone and I told you I wouldn't call ever again. Can I turn on some music? Sure. On the computer. Shit, don't put on anything too... -Too what? -Too you. Do you remember? -Come on, dance. -No. Come on, dance! Are you coming? Don't be boring. Come on! I’ll go with the others. -Yeah? You sure? -Yeah, yeah. Don't worry. See you. Ok. Bye. -Is she mad? -Don't worry about it. Can I have two shots, please? Two shots. If your parents knew... Knew what? That I serve you alcohol. They were also young once. And an adult perverted them? I'm sure. That's how it goes the first time. -Let's go swimming! -Jean! No, no, no... No. Hey, what are you doing? Don't you dare, Jean. Jean! You're drunk! Jean, let's go back to the others. Seriously. -Jean, please. -Why? It's dangerous. It's a bad idea, Jean. Even far away, your feet still touch the ground. It's not necessary, don't. Let's do something else. Listen, Elena, please. Trust me. I'll jump in and jump out. Not even two minutes. I promise. Ok, ok. You don't know what you're missing! Shit, it's freezing! It's so cold! Jean, Jean? Are you ok? -Are you ok? -It's freezing. It's freezing. -Is that better? -Yeah, yeah. Is that better? Alright. You feel better, Jean? Take your phone. -Come with me. -Where are we going? -I know a trick. Sit down. -Here? Yeah, here. -See? Now it's not as windy. -Thanks. -Is it working? -Yeah, fantastic. Ok. What are you doing? I'm going to put on some music. It's nice. You like it? Can I lay down? Your boyfriend is old. He wants nothing to do with me. He's not old. Sure. He's really old. How old do you think he is? I don't know, more or less my dad's age. More or less. Do you love him? Yes. And he loves you more. Oh shit... Jean! I'll be back. Coming! What are you doing out so late? Who were you with? With Elena, she walked me home. Good evening. Hello. What's up? You seem a bit off, don't you? Not at all. Not at all? Seems like it. You're stumbling. What? -Can I say goodbye to her? -Make it quick. Are you really late? No, but I am very drunk. Yeah. We overdid it a little. Yeah, but I had fun. What about you? What about me? Did you have fun? Lots. Marry me. Jean, get over here right now! Sweet dreams. No! Come back! I don't want to leave your side. Let's go. Elena? Elena, how's it going? Want a beer? -I think so. Cheers, cheers! -Cheers. Cheers. Everything ok? Want some? Want to dance with us? Want to dance with us? I wanted to tell you there's something really special about you. Something very special. Something very... -What time is it? -It's still very early. -You coming? -Can I have a hit? What about my friends? They left? Yeah, a while ago. Alright, one cigarette and then we're going to Dax. Let's get some beer, man. Are you coming to Dax? Where are you going? Let her go, she's nuts. -And super hot. -Come on. -What? -I need you. -To do what? -Wait, wait, don’t know. -Help me. -With what? You better come back! I'm coming, I'm coming! Help me up. -Here? -Yes. One, two, three. -Need help down? -You ok? Sorry. Thank you and sorry. I forgot this. So prepared. Life is expensive, my dear. -It sure is. -How intelligent! Hello ladies and gentlemen, Mattieu here. We're off on a morning expedition. A 3-day trip to Landes. Sixty kilometers on foot. It looks promising. Check out the wonderful landscape out here, this morning light, gloomy, it's incredible. Check out our driver, as fresh as a morning rose. -Our friend Benoît. -With this mug. -And a new arrival, Elena. -Hello. Hello, Elena. What's up? Tell me, young man, are we having some trouble driving? You're scaring me. This is like an Uber, relax. You've got bottles of water, candy... We're testing what resistance? -Of Matthieu and the suspension! -Don't do that! -Does your dad know you drive drunk? -Ok, ok, ok. Let's move on to something more interesting. Hi, Elena. Goodnight. -Good morning. -Good morning, excuse me. Why did you come to France if Spain is beautiful, has nice weather, paella, sunshine, corridas... The corridas! If you only knew about corridas... I don't know what corrida is. You can explain later. What are you doing in a club here? With all those young people. Why were you with us? -Tell me why. -Why not? How long until we get to Dax? Didn't you say how old you are earlier? -Too old for you. -"Too old for you." Yes, it's true those in this car are a bit young. I think there is something... Can you tell me where we're going? Ok, ok. I'll be right with you. Do I go left? Right? Where do I go? -Go straight. -I'm heading into the woods. Go straight. You see the forest? Don't touch the phone! -Ok, ok, ok. -Stop, stop, please. -What? -So I can get out. -Are you going to throw up? -No, I want to go home. -You're not coming? -No, no. -Elena, it's an amazing after party. -Stop here, or wherever you can. Don't stop, she's crazy. -Did you just call me crazy? -Yes, crazy, crazy. -The hell I'm crazy. -Please, please, please... Ten more minutes. I told you to stop, buddy. Stop! Elena, you said you're coming. I'm sorry, we can't go without you. You've been very kind, but stop. Stop the car. I'm sorry, this is my duty as a friend. -You aren't going to stop? -No, no, no. -You're not stopping? -It'll be cool. It'll be fun, it will be great. Hey, watch the car! Don't record me. Don't record me. You think you are ugly at this hour? Turn off the phone. Yeah? You'll turn off the phone? Elena, come back, come back! I told you to stop the car. It will all be ok. -Calm down, everything's ok. -Etienne, I don't want to go. -Just 15 minutes... -Did you hear what I said? Stop, dammit! What, what? What? His name is Benoît, I am Etienne. I'll call him whatever I want. -Stop the damn car. -You said you'd come. Are you a liar? -I changed my mind. -Changed your mind? God dammit! I changed my mind. Stop the fucking car! Stop filming me! Stop the fucking car! I said stop the fucking car! Don't film me! Stop filming me, stop the fucking car! Stop the fucking car! Fucking great... Fucking psycho. How are you? Is there any coffee? Thanks. -Did you have breakfast? -Yes. You don't want to sit? Were you with him? -No. -Please don't lie to me. I'm not lying. I was with... With people from work. We went dancing and we met some guys in a bar. I don't believe you. -Well, you're wrong. -Really? I'm wrong? He wouldn't happen to resemble Iván, right? He's a kid. And he's not your son. Elena, look at me. Elena... What are you planning to do? Do you have a plan? I do. I want us to move up the trip and for you to come with me now. You can leave your job this week. I can't. We'll tell them you're leaving today and we'll go on Monday. I have to close. Patrice can do it without any problem. Are you in or aren't you? Finish your breakfast, you're late. It's a tough blow, honestly. I know. Did something happen? It's a personal matter. There's only 15 days left this season, can you finish it? This is a low blow, Elena. You're really leaving me hanging. I have no choice, right? Isn't that right? We're very sorry, honestly. Yes, I'm sorry too. -I'll get back to work. -Yes, get back to work. Hello? I'm making green beans. Want some? Did you buy fruit? No. -There wasn’t any. -Wasn’t there? Well, nothing I liked. I'm going to the bathroom. Hello? Jean, it's Elena. -Hey. -Hey. I looked for you at the beach, is everything ok? -Terrible, they went crazy. -Your parents? About yesterday? I fought with my mom, she won't let me leave the house. She's completely insane. I'm sorry. Truly. They're assholes. I feel bad for them. Do you want me to do something? Talk to them? No, I don't want them near you. Elena? Is everything ok? Coming. I have to go. I'm leaving in five days. When can I see you? Can I call you later? It's better if I call you, ok? Ok. I miss you. -Goodbye. -Bye. I buy them in India or China. Everywhere, it's fantastic. She travels every winter? -Indeed. -Wonderful. -It's great. -Yes, they're really nice. -And not expensive. -No, it's affordable. Yes, it's fantastic. -What does that woman want? -A latte. -I'll take it to her. -Ok. -A latte, right? -Yes, thank you very much. If you need something else, I'll be here. -It's Elena, right? -Yes. Do you have time for a coffee with me? If you aren't too busy, of course. Sure, I'll be right back. Come get me in five minutes, ok? Thank you, you're very kind. I thought maybe I would be bothering you, you must be very busy. Not at all, this way I get a break. -Are you enjoying your time here? -Yes. We'll be coming more often. I'll have to come and go from Paris, but I don't mind. It's so pleasant here, it's incredible. So peaceful. This place is special. Yes. There are two older women who dress the same, they wear the same swimsuit. They're always around, have you seen them? They go from one end to the other, I've never seen them stop. They're always out there. Have you been here all summer? That's funny, I've never seen you. -There are so many tourists. -Yes, lots. How long? Living here? Ten years. Really? How did you get here? If you don't mind me asking. How does a Spaniard end up living here for ten years? Why not? Do you see yourself living here the rest of your life? Excuse me? I don't know why I asked. Do you have children? I saw you with my son the other day. I said: "She's good with children." Do you not want children, or... It's on the house. So soon? Yes, I have work to do. -Responsibilities? -Exactly. I love responsible people, they're trustworthy. What about you? What about me? Do you like responsible people? Goodbye. Goodbye. I'm sorry, it's only been four minutes... Thank you for the coffee. REPLY This is it, right? Looks that way. I'll wait as long as you need. Good morning, ma'am. A table for one? No, I'm meeting someone. -Over there. -Thank you. How are you? Good. Do you want something? Thanks for coming. -Would you like something? -No thank you. Another, please. How have you been? What are you doing here? Travelling, I had a few days off. This is a really pretty area. Besides, I wanted to see you. -Are you still in Vieux-Boucau? -Yes. Well, I'm about to move, actually. In a few days. Where to? -A town close to Donostia. -Oh, wonderful. Yes. I'm going with... Well, I'm seeing someone. And we're going. He's really helped me. I'm glad. Really. -Here you are. -Thank you. You wouldn't like anything? No thank you. Well this is pretty. Yeah. -How is your mother? -Good. -Do you see her often? -Yes, she's doing well. Your parents? -Old. -Makes sense. You aren't going to believe this. The other day... Well, a while ago, I was in your old apartment. We were in the area and some of Nacho's friends invited us over. And it was yours. Well, where you used to live. -Seriously? -Yeah. And since Nacho never saw your house, I was there and suddenly went pale. They asked what was wrong and I told them that I had been there before. I don't know... It was strange. It was very strange. Who are they? -Nacho's friends? -Yes. People from Reiki. -What do you mean Reiki? -Yeah. -Nacho? -Yes. Nacho has become a Reiki fanatic. Unbelievable, huh? I also dabble a bit. You do Reiki? Well, they do it on me. Well... So, I'm travelling, on vacation. And the truth is I wanted to see you. Sure. I'm also with someone. We've been together for a few years. She has also really helped me. I told her everything from the start. I didn't want to have to tell her again, or tell her later and have her take off. She was... Just imagine. But we kept seeing each other and... I don't know. We're in a good place. I'm glad. We have a son. He's eight months old. Now we're going to Toulouse because Carla, Carla is her name, she has friends from college there. And... I've been better since he was born. I wanted to tell you. Are they here? I'd like to see her. -Carla? -Yes, Carla. I'm curious. If you want we can arrange... To know what kind of person can be with someone like you. What kind of human being can share his life with you. Who could fall in love with you? Elena, please. Someone worthless, unable to take care of his family, someone so selfish and stupid to lose the only good thing he's done in his life, and that he will ever do in his shitty life. I wish it had happened to you. If you ever come near me again, I'll call the police. Don't forget I can still ruin your life. Let's go. I'll go to the bathroom and make dinner. JEAN: 7 MISSED CALLS WHERE ARE YOU? ANSWER ME PLEASE I NEED TO TALK TO YOU TALK TO THEM, PLEASE I'll be right back. Where are you going? -For a walk. -What's wrong? Nothing. -Is it him? -Who? -Ramón. -No. Want me to come? I'd prefer to be alone, if you don't mind. Are you lying to me? No. Are you sure? Don't take too long. I'll be back soon, ok? Yes? Good evening. Is Jean home? Who is this? It's Elena, is he there? Hello? Listen, we're having dinner. I... I would like to talk to you, please. Sorry, it's not a good time. Please let us enjoy dinner. Thank you. Who was it? Nobody. -It was her, right? -She's crazy about you, kid. Quiet, Benoît. If it was for me, why didn't you say so? I just told you it was nobody, is that clear? Benoît, please pass me the salad. Did you see what Valls said today? He's really an idiot, huh? I don't know what people see in him. -Somebody answer me! -Jean, calm down and eat! -You calm down, dammit! -That's enough! -Elena! Elena! -Are you insane? Let go of me! -Hold on... -Let go of me! Calm down. -Let go of me! -Calm down! I hope you fucked her because Mom will scare her off. Get back! Dammit. What are you doing? Elena! Let me talk to her, I'm begging you. No! Enough! Get inside. Is this what you want? An unhinged kid? I just want to know if he is ok. -Please. -For the last time, get out of here! Benoît, come on! Benoît, come on! -Shut up! -What are you doing? Come back to the table, please. Don't worry, it will be ok. Benjamin, what are you doing? Elena? It's ok. Get out of our house. I just want to know Jean is ok. That's all I want, then I'll leave. If you don't leave, I'm calling the police. -Are you ok, Jean? -No, let me go! What happened? Ok. -Don't come any closer. -Jean is fine, ok? Just stay there. If he tells me he's ok, I'll go. Tell me what happened, Jean. Talk to me. Enough! Get out! This isn't your house! -Get out. -They're crazy! More than ever, they’ve hit me! I've never hit you, are you insane? Will you just leave my son alone? -Give me five minutes! -Want me to throw her out? Let's calm down. Now please leave. Should I take care of her? I just want you to know I would never do Jean any harm. -Get out of my house, for God’s sake! -Get lost, bitch! Get out, dammit! Do you understand? Get out! Get out! If you come back, we'll rape you to death, understand? Now get out! Go away! Go! Get out! Quick! Get lost or I swear I'll... Get out! Does this hurt? Yes. What about this? Ok. It just happened, right? Yes, no more than an hour ago. Right? She fell. Ok. We'll take an x-ray to make sure it's not broken. Wait here. They'll come get you. Thank you. Why did you say that? We'll say that so there's no more trouble. You barged into their house. You didn't see him. -He's a kid. -Exactly. Leave him alone. Hello. It's really late, isn't it? Why didn't you wake me up? Want some coffee? Sure. Are we leaving right now? Well, when we finish, right? But seriously, we're leaving right now? -Why didn't you wake me up? -You needed to sleep. Yes, but... I don't know, I'd like to say goodbye. You don't think I should? I don't know, what do you think? -Should I call them? -Whatever you want. Ok, well... Where's my phone? Everything from that drawer is already packed. Here, use mine if you want. Ok. Give me that. Well, that's everything. Everything else in my car, ok? This is going to be good. Should we continue? Will you take this? It's light. -What? -This. Shall we? -Is that my phone? -What? Something's ringing. I don't know. -Where is it? -It's packed, you won't find it. Elena, why don't you just call later? What are you doing? Elena, please. Calm down. Who was it? Who was it? Hello? Jean? -Sorry for calling. -Don't worry. I got away. What? We were on our way to Paris. We stopped at a gas station and I got away without them noticing. But they just realized because they keep calling. Do you know where you are? No, I took off running and don't know where I am. Ok, stay calm, alright? I am calm. What is it? Did he get lost? -What can I do? -Come. What do you see? How long ago did you leave? Only about half an hour. I'm in a forest. I don't want to go back in case I see them. I'm going to find him. Would you rather I call the police or his family? Please, tell him not to do anything. I only want to see you. -I'm going, ok? -You're not going. Jean, I'll call you in a minute. I'm coming to find you. I'm hanging up. Wait, please. I'm close to the forest we were at. Go to the entrance. I'll call you right back. Ok. I have to go. -You can't. -Yes. He's a minor and he's missing. We have to call his family. Ok. Then call them. That's all I can do. Can you give me the car keys? Please. When you get back, I won't be here. I know. Here. Thank you. How are you? Good. I'm sorry. -Does it hurt? -No. Did you call your parents? I sent them a message. I said not to bother me and I'll call them later. Later when? I don't know. Right now, I just want to be with you. To say goodbye. Should we go somewhere? Yes. -Can I put on some music? -Sure. So, you're going to Paris? I don't want to stop seeing you. Will you come to Paris? You don't want to see me? I don't think it's a good idea. I need you. Is it because I remind you of your son? I don't want you to leave me alone. You won't be alone. But I want to be with you. You'll never be alone. -Are you ok? -I'm fine. -Are you ok, Jean? -Everything's fine. Never do that to me again. Is Benoît ok? Yes, don't worry. Let's get going, it's really raining. Jean? Are you sure you're ok? Don't worry, really. Shall we go? Mom, are you coming? Ramón? Yes? It's Elena. Can you talk? Yes, sure. MOTHER
