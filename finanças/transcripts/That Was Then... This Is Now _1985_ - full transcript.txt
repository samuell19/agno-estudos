Why do you have to be such an asshole? Fine. What happened with you in the parking lot tonight? What do you mean? I mean, you backed down to that guy. Well, what was I supposed to do? You want me to smack the guy and start some kind of a brawl? You would have a month ago. Or were you worried it was going to ruin your date? Yeah, well, it did anyway, didn't it? You ever get the feeling that the whole thing's just changing? Like how? I don't know, just things. Yeah, I guess. I like... i like things are coming to an end. 'Cause new things are beginning, you know? Yeah. I kind of like when we were young. You remember we used to get in those fights? And our buddies were always right there to back us up.

When you go along thinking you know somebody, ...thinking... they love you the same way you love them. But I'll tell you something... What? Nothing. Nothing. So where's your partner? He's crashed out. What about the rules? There ain't no rules. There ain't no fuckin' rules. - Hi, Ma. - Hey. How are you? - Hi, Mark. - Hi. Hey, how did you do that? Ma! Earphones! Oh.

You want to help me go look for him tonight? Oh, you, me and the flying nun? She can't go. I just you and me. Sounds good. How'd you get that? I gave a guy five twenties. No, eight ball, side pocket. You? Played a couple of jerks. Yeah, I bet. Watch the bottom of that thing. - Hey. - What? This is great, huh? Wha great? You and me, together. Just like old times. Yeah. I just don't remember it being this boring. Boring? Whoo! I thought we were going to look for M&M. Yeah, we will later. Always in control, huh? Always. Bryon... Bryon, I'm so glad to see you. Where you been keeping yourself, sweetheart? All over. You still mad at me? What, are you kidding? Bryon never holds a grudge. You're the only boy I ever cared about. Hey, Angela, le go for a ride. A ride? Yeah, you and Bryon can talk over old times, and I'll pick up some more booze for you. What do you say? Okay. Hey, man... What is this stuff? Rum. Tastes more like tequila. I hate that... ...tequila. Last time I drank tequila, I got so sick, I thought I was gonna die. Don't give me none of that tequila. Mark, can you pass me that pop to mix with this? You know... sometimes... I feel... like I just want to cut it short. You know? Just check myself out. I always said, "Shit... "I can get what I want, and everybody else can go to hell." But it doesn't work that way. I'm going to hell right along with them. I'm already there. My brothers are in jail now. Those stupid jerks. Jail, huh? Mm-hmm. For how long? I don't know. A while... I guess. I'm just so damn... tired. Bryon. Hmm? Is she out? Dude, she's out cold. Boy, I thought she was never gonna shut up. I sure hate to see gutsy chicks break. Destroys my faith in human nature. You're never gonna break, huh, Mark? Nope. Where'd you get those? Picked them up when I got the pop. You're not gonna cut all of it off are you? Yeah, I am. Setting you up. Getting me cracked with that bottle. Fuckin' bitch. You know, Mark, I been thinking. Yeah, buddy? What have you been thinking about? Oh, a lot of things. When did we start running around together? I don't know. Well, we've always been friends-- even before I moved in here. I just can't help thinking about things, you know? You know, like Charlie. And M&M and Cathy, you know. And you. I all so mixed up. And you shouldn't have cut off Angela's hair. You made her look like Mr. Potato Head. You think Charlie felt any pain? I imagine he did. Shit, man. Charlie, right? He tries to help us out, and look what happened to him. Yeah. How come things happen like that? And one minute, you're standing there talking to the guy, and the next minute, pow! It seems like, when you try to help people out, you just end up getting fucked, you know? I mean, if someone said to Charlie, "Hey, man, is saving a couple of kids from getting beat up worth, you know... worth your life?" He'd have said, "Hell, no." He would have. Yeah, he would have said that. He would have said that. Why did your dad shoot your mom? Because of some fight. She shot him back, but... What were they fighting about? Me. I was hiding under the porch... and I could hear 'em real plain. The old man was saying... "I don't care. "He don't even look like me. "Nobody on my side has eyes that color. Not on your side neither." Then the old lady says... "Tha right. "Why should he look like anybody in your family? "He ain't yours. "He ain't... yours." And they started screaming back and forth. And then I just hear the sound like a couple of firecrackers. Tha just what it sounded like-- firecrackers. And then I thought to myself... "I can go live with Bryon and his mom." I was nine years old. Did you really think that? Yeah. I got sick of them yelling and fighting all the time. I got beat a lot, too. I remember thinking, "Man, this will save me the trouble of shooting him myself." I don't like... anybody... hurting me. You'd have liked my dad. Yep, you'd have liked my dad, man. I sure wish I knew where M&M was. Wish I knew what happened to him. He's okay. Take my word for it. You know where he is, man? No, not exactly, but, uh... ...I know where he might be hanging out. Listen, man, if you know where he is, you got to take me to him. Okay, Bryon. Tomorrow. Hey, Mark. Hey, Bob. One's here. You bet. Wow. Yummy, huh? They check in, but they don't check out. This place is disgusting. So what? So i not what you're into. Don't knock it, all right? All I said was this place is disgusting. So i disgusting. I don't like to see you judging people, tha all. I'm not judging people. Wha wrong with you, man? These people friends of yours? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, fuck off, Bryon. So what about this place? What about it? Is this where M&M's been hanging out? I what I heard. Tha what you heard, or tha what you know? Look, maybe i none of your goddamn business what M&M wants to do. Well, maybe I'm making it my business. Well, then tha your fucking problem! No, tha our problem! Okay, i our problem! Then we got a problem. Then we got a problem. You want to come in? No. I better go find Mark. Mark who? Okay, sorry. Sorry. All right, you better go find him. Yo, Terry! I thought you guys were in the slammer. We're out now. Yeah, I bet. You seen my sister? Which sister is that? Angela. You seen her lately? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I saw her last night. No kidding. Did you know Angela got her hair cut? Is that right? At least tha what people say. She told me something different. Yeah? Wha she telling you? She said you got her drunk and cut off all her hair. Now, I don't think she'd lie about something like that. What do you think, Tim? I don't think she'd lie about something like that either. Well, I'm sorry. I'd really like to help you guys, but I just can't. You ain't half as sorry as you're going to be. Oh, shit! Jesus Christ, Bryon. What happened? What happened, man? Who did this to you? The Shepards. Those motherfuckers! Motherfuckers! Fuck! All right, what do you want to do? You want us to take you to a hospital? No. No? Man, you look like you've been through a meat grinder. Tha what I feel like. I'm going to call your mom and tell her we're going to stay here tonight, all right? Is that okay with you, Terry? No problem. All right, then we're going to look up the Shepards. You grab a couple of baseball bats, okay? - I'll be right back. - Mark... I don't want anybody to fight the Shepards. What are you talking about, Bryon? I just had enough of it, man. This getting-even shit, it just keeps going in circles, and I've had it. You're not thinking clear, man. I said, forget it, all right? Whatever. What the hell are you trying to do to me, man? What? - What? - What? What?! What the hell are you trying to do to me, Bryon? Huh? How do you think this makes me feel, man? How the fuck do you think this makes me feel?! You think I don't know they beat the shit out of you for something I did, huh?! And here you are, man, practically saying you had it coming to you when it was me who cut Angela's hair. I planned it, I did it, and you're the one who gets nailed for it! How do you think I feel, Bryon? Man, if they had killed you, it would have been my fault. I not your fault, man. I was in it as much as you were. I'm just sick and tired of all the fighting. Oh... I can't believe my brother's living here. I'm not sure he is. I just... i just a possibility. There he is, over there. M&M? M&M? Is he okay? Hey, little buddy, can you hear me? Hey. Hey... Oh, God... He doesn't look too good. Here, take the keys, drive. - Okay. - I'll get him up. All right, just get him. Watch it. You just relax, M&M. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay. I went into my stomach, and there were these colors. The colors was coming, too. Jesus Christ, M&M, what did you do to yourself, huh? There was this color, I don't know what his name was. It told me I was being paid back for all the candy I ate. I didn't know about the candy before. I didn't think i my fault. - I not, buddy, you're right. - Bryon? I'm here. - Where's Mark? - He's not here. - You guys are always together. - He's not here. - Where's Mark? - He's not here. I have to see Mark! I got to see Mark! Okay, okay, we'll find Mark for you. Just relax, M&M, okay, just relax. - I've got you. - He knows about the colors. He knows what they mean. M&M, what do you mean? When he gave it to me, he said, "Only take half of this." He said, "Take only half of this." He told me when he gave it to me, he said, "M&M, only take half of this." What? Why didn't I listen to him?! I should have listened to him! Tell me what you just said. Tell me tha not what... Please don't tell on me, okay? M&M, tell me... What did you just say? M&M? Nothing, i not right, all right? M&M, tell me that isn't true. Tell me i not true. What did you just say? Where am I?! Where am I?! Come on. He's killing me! Settle down. Settle down! M&M, just calm... Bryon, stop him! Help him, please! Le drive to the hospital. Le just get to the hospital! M&M, stop it, please. No! Please, just... Mr. Carlson, he's in no immediate danger, but we would like to keep him here for a couple of days and run some tests. Tests? Yes, they're basic tests to find out if there's been any oxygen loss or tissue damage. Plus, we don't know yet what kinds of drugs he's been taking. Can I see him? Why don't you wait just a little while? I'll let you know. Excuse me. Cath, you better go home. I want to stay here with you, Dad. I want you to go home and be with your mother. What are we going to tell her? Cath, you ready to go? I... I appreciate all your help. You're welcome, sir. Cath? Cathy. Cathy, wha the matter? Wha the matter? You know what I mean. No, all I know is Mark screwed up my brother. Well, I can't believe that, all right? You won't believe that. The kid was out of it, Cathy. He didn't know what he was saying. You're jumping to conclusions. Bryon, M&M could have said anyone, but he said Mark. You think tha just a coincidence? No. No way-- it doesn't leave a whole lot of doubt in my mind. Well, it does in mine. Well, then you're crazy. I'm crazy? And you believe M&M? He's a fucking basket case. Cathy! Cathy, goddamn it! I'm sorry. So am I. Mark. Wha going on? Oh, you found 'em, huh? Well, don't worry about it, man. I don't take 'em. I have a good time just like I am. Just how are you, Mark? What? M&M's in the hospital, drug overdose. What?! Jesus, tha terrible. We found him... We found him at that place just like you said. It was a good thing that you did. Bryon, don't look at me like that. I said I don't take 'em. What, so you sell 'em? Huh? We needed the money, man. What the hell are you worried about? M&M. What about him? You gave it to him, didn't you, huh? Do you have any idea how fucked up he is? How could you do that, man? I never forced it on M&M, Bryon. I never forced it on anybody. But you gave it to him. If hadn't gotten it from me, he would have gotten it from somebody else. That doesn't make it right. Look, I-I-I'll quit selling right now. I'll quit selling right this minute. I just... I just sort of thought you knew about it, tha all. You just don't get it, do you? You just don't get it. Goddamn it, Bryon. I want you to leave, Mark. Okay. All right, I'll-I'll, uh... I'll come back when you're feeling better. No, I mean, I want you to leave for good. I want you to take your stuff and get out. What the hell you talking about? I said get out! Just take your stuff and get out! Why... why are you doing this to me, brother? You're not my brother, man. I love you, Bryon. I got nowhere else to go, man. You'll do okay, man, you always do, all right? So tha it? I that easy, huh? Well, fine. I don't need you. I don't need anybody. Hey, man, you're not taking the car! Get out of the car, man! Get out! I don't need you. I don't need anybody. I'm getting out of here, man. I'm getting out. And this isn't mine. Fuck you! God, Mom, what did I do? I really screwed things up, didn't I? Sure. Take all the credit. Hi, Bryon. How are you, Angela? Pretty good. I hear you dumped old wha -her-name. Good riddance, if you ask me. Where'd you hear that? I around school. Well, i not true. Well, you did dump Mark. Tha a fact. You know, you look really good in short hair, Angel. Excuse me. I'd like to order. I'll have a hamburger and a Coke. And some fries. And a dinner salad... ...a side of baked beans... an order of potato salad... and a grilled cheese sandwich. Also, a-a large bowl of your soup of the day. Apple pie with three scoops of chocolate ice cream. Oh, wait a minute-- I'm on a diet. You better make that vanilla. Anything else? Yeah, make that a double order of everything, and I'll be back to pick it up when you get off work. How you doin', buddy? Okay. How you doing? Everything's under control. Wha it like in here? If I told you what it was like, you'd be sick. I wanted to see you, Bryon. I hear you been causing a lot of trouble around here. Yeah. I don't seem to be able to get away with anything anymore. How long you figure you'll be sentenced for? I don't know. Pretty cool place to live in for a while. I like... reality, man. Look, um... I don't know when I'll be able to get back here again. Look, I want you to tell your mom that I said thanks for all the cakes and stuff she's been sending me. Why don't you tell her yourself when you come home? No. I weird, huh? We were best friends. We're like brothers. Yeah, well... like a friend once said to me-- that was then... this is now. Yeah, who said that? I don't know. Some asshole. I'll bet. Lighten up, dude. Everything is going to turn out okay. Lighten up, dude.
