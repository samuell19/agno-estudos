Woman: That day I first showed up on Brewster place, all I could think was, "how did this happen to me?" Seems like, as soon as you get comfortable in life something comes along to turn your life upside down. You never know what's gonna happen and sometimes things which seems the worst works out different in the end. Like that big ol' wall cuttin' off the light from my plants. Even it had its purpose. It was a long journey from the farm in Tennessee where I come from all the way up here. But I reckon how I was always meant to be here on Brewster place. Back with the other women and back with ciel. We did a lot of laughin' here, and some cryin'. Most important, though, we learned that when we women came together there was a power inside US we never felt before. Woman: Leave me alone! Man: Shut up! Girls: ♪ grandma, grandma, sick in bed ♪ ♪ we called the doctor and the doctor said...♪ Girl: It's my turn! It is my turn. Good afternoon, ma'am. Oh, you must be the new tenant. I heard you was comin' today. Welcome to Brewster place. I'm the handyman. Just call me Ben. How do you do? Oh, I got your key here someplace. Oh, here it is. Come on, we can go on up, and, uh, see if everything's working. Or, knowing this place, see if anything's working. I can let myself in, thank you. No, I told miss ciel I'd take good care of you. - I'll take care of ya. - I'd rather go myself, mister. Ben. I'm Ben. Thank you. All right, suit yourself. If you need anything, I'm in the basement. Number 11-a. Can you remember that? Woman in distance: Look at this mess! Woman: Boy, you better come on in here! Woman: Here, chick, chick, chick-ee. Here, chick, chick, chick-ee. Here, chick, chick, chick-ee. Here, chick, chick, chick-ee. Here, chick, chick, chick-ee. - Hey, gal. - Here, chick, chick. Here, chick, chick, chick-ee. Here, chick, chick, chick-ee. I said, "hey, gal." I heard you the first time. Here, chick, chick, chick-ee. Here, chick, chick. Gal, are you gonna come over here or not? I do have a name, butch Fuller. Oh, oh! Please, please 'cuse this poor, ignorant, colored folks, miss Mattie, ma'am. Or, or, shoul's I says, miss Mattie Michael, ma'am. Or, or, shoul's I say miss ma'am-- I gets it all mixed up and stuff. There you go. That's better. And now I done gone through all that, I hope I get what I come for. A cup of that cool spring water is all. Guess I couldn't deny a dog a drink on a day like this. Well, that's mighty hospitable of ya. - Here. - Why, thank you, miss Mattie. And, uh, since you inquired as to my whereabouts-- I did no such thing. I'm fittin' to go down to low ground, pick me up some wild herbs, and, um, go on over to the morgans' sugar cane field. Now, if you wants to come along, picks you out a few, be more than obliged to carry them back this way for ya. Of course, I know what your daddy will say. "Why, that butch Fuller, he ain't nothin' but a no-count ditch hound and ain't no decent woman be seen talkin' to him." He only says that 'cause it's the truth. Yeah, well, big woman like you's afraid of what her daddy might say? I ain't afraid of nothin, butch Fuller. Besides, papa's gone to take mama to town. Well, then? Sugar cane remind me of you, miss Mattie. It's plump and sweet, but it sure is a whole lot of trouble. Ah. Just reach in my overall top and get me out my kerchief, huh? This sweat's fittin' to blind me. Well, we got our cane. Let's go. Now, ain't that just like a woman. Drag a man clear out of his way, cut three times more cane than he need, except they want double-time back home before he get a chance to rest himself, let alone gather up them herbs he really come all this way for. All right. Where's the herb patch? Just in the clearing in them woods. Come on, gal. I ain't gonna bite ya. Jeez, this is nice, huh? Whew. Lord, gal, ain't your feet tired after all that walking? You blaspheme too much. You ain't supposed to use the lord's name in vain. Y'all folks and your "ain'ts." You ain't supposed to do this, you ain't supposed to do that. That's how come I never been no Christian, 'cause all it mean is, you can't enjoy the one life god give ya. So what's your idea of enjoying life, butch Fuller? Runnin' after every woman you see? Mattie. Mattie, I don't be runnin' after everywoman I see. I just don't stay around long enough to let the good times go sour, is all. You know, when two people get in a rut and they start cussin' and fightin' and carrying on, and then they only hanging on 'cause they done forgot how to let go. You see, all the women I know, they don't remember nothin' but good days with me. And then they get stuck with men who beat on 'em and cheat on 'em and ignore 'em. And all they got to do is sit back and think about ol' butch. And they say, "yeah, that was a sweet red thing." And all our days were sun-lit. May not have been a long-timer, but sure was a good time. That might be true, but other folks say-- I know what sanctimonious folks like your daddy say about me. You know what? It ain't cost me a lick of sleep. My daddy can't help it if you got a bad reputation. My reputation ain't none of your daddy's business. Just like it ain't none of my business your daddy want his daughter sittin' up in the house gettin' old and not keepin' company, so she so dumb, she don't know her head from a hole in the ground. For your information, butch Fuller, I keep company every sunday afternoon. With who? Fred Watson. Fred Watson? Gal, that ain't keepin' company, that's sittin' up at a wake. Shoot, here I was, all set to get jealous of someone, and all you talkin' about is ol' "dead Fred." Hell, I could come around your house, steal you away with two suitcases before ol' Fred could bat an eye. You ever notice it take him twice as long to blink as the average person? No, I ain't noticed that. Yeah, well next time you sittin' up on your daddy's front porch in one of them hot, passionate courtin' sessions, before you nod off, just take notice of how he blinks. Yeah, ol' dead Fred. Miss Mattie Michael. Mm-mm-mm. How'd you ever get a name like "Michael" anyway? Shouldn't it be "Michaels"? Papa said, when the emancipation came, his daddy was a little boy, and he'd always been hard of hearin', so people on the plantation had to call him twice to get his attention. So, since his name was Michael, they always used to have to say, "Michael! Michael." So, when the union census-taker came, and asked what my granddaddy's name was, everybody said "Michael Michael" was all they knew. And so, then the yankee census-taker came. He-- when the yankee census-taker came, he put that down. And we been Michael-Michael ever since. Mama, I can't stand much more of this. Don't worry, baby. He can't spend the rest of his life not talking. This thing has done hurt him. That's all. I know. You didn't tell him it was butch, did you? You think I wanna see my man in jail for killin' the likes of butch Fuller? Besides, it ain't for me to tell. I'm so ashamed. Now, you listen to me, girl. There ain't nothin' for you to be ashamed about. Having a baby is the most natural thing in the world. There ain't nothin' in the Bible that says having a baby's sinful. The sin is in the fornicating and god done forgave you for that a long time ago. What's going on in your belly now ain't nothin' to hang your head about. You remember that. Yes, ma'am. Mattie's father: Mattie, come on out here. Go on. Yes, papa? I been thinking about this here thing. I done always try to do my best by you. I seen to it you never seen a hungry day. Never had to go out and ask nobody for nothin'. Now, ain't that true? Yes, papa. I know folks say it a lot. I put too much store in you, keeping you too close to home, settin' you up to be better than other folks. But all I know is, I done the best I know how to do. Papa, you ain't done nothing wrong, i'm-- it could be, I should have let you marry that Harris boy that you were sweet on once. I just wanted something better for you than some wanderin' field hand draggin' you off to Arkansas, keeping you away from your family, and-- what's past... Is past. Now, I still think this Fred Watson is a tolerable fellow. In spite of what he done. Fred? Well, I mean, I was young once, too. Done and made plenty of mistakes. Ain't through makin' them, either. So, I figure, I go on over there to his place tomorrow morning after breakfast and just clear this thing up. I know he'd be willing to do the right thing by you. Papa, it ain't Fred's baby. What? It ain't Fred's. Whose is it? I said, whose is it? I ain't saying. What do you mean, you ain't saying? I ain't-- hm? I ain't sayin'. You will too say! - Sam! - Stay out of this, fannie! Now, you tell me, or I'm gonna beat it out of you! Well? Huh? Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! - Sam, stop it! - Tell me! Sam! For the love of Jesus! Fannie! Get off of me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! So help me, Jesus, you hit my child again, and I'll meet your soul in hell. Fannie-- i-- fannie, she-- oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. I had such hopes for that girl, fannie. Oh, fannie. I had dreams. Look at her. Mattie: Oh, etta, isn't he the most perfect thing you ever saw? Ooh! Oh! No, he's just as ugly as he can be, just like every other newborn I ever seen. Oh, looky there, you done hurt his feelings. Give him here. Hurt his feelings. Go back to your mama. Oh, that's okay, baby. I can't stand those squealing babies. You see why I can't have no children? I don't got the Patience for all that. The Patience comes with the baby, etta. All you know is, it's yours and you gotta do for it. And you're all mine, aren't you, baby? All mine. That's right, all yours. Built in heartache for the next 20 years. Etta. Now, me, when I want ready-made trouble, I dig up a handsome man. No diapers to change, and I'll walk when I'm ready. That's what I'm fixin' to do, too. Bennett's starting to fray my nerves. - You leavin'? - Mm-hmm. Hm. I was ready to leave months ago, when I got your letter but I wanted to wait until you got settled, and now you're settled. You don't need me. And this town is dead. Where you goin'? Oo-hoo. New York City. That's the only place to be right now. All them soldier boys just pulling up to the dock with pockets full of combat pay just looking for somebody to help 'em spend it. And Mattie, they got this place called Harlem with nothin' but wall-to-wall colored doctors and businessmen. You just gonna leave US here? Well, you could come with me you should come with me! With all them possibilities, you bound to find this baby a rich daddy. Etta, I can't go draggin' my baby all around the country behind you. I remember when you first left home, you said, "St. Louis is the place to be." Then it was, "Chicago is the place to be." Then it was here, and now it's New York City. You ain't gonna find whatever it is you're looking for that way. Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna find it sitting here. - And neither will you. - I ain't lookin' for nothin', etta. I got everything I need right here, in this baby god's done sent me. Well, as long as god sends you something to feed him, I reckon you'll be fine. It's okay, honey. We got each other. We got each other. Mm. Take a look at this. Miss Cleo? Miss Cleo? Is this an emergency, miss Michael? Well, I guess, um-- don't guess so, no. Then save it for after my lunch. That's what I wanted to talk to you about, miss Cleo, my lunch break? You see, I have to go home at lunch and check on my baby, and it's 30 blocks, and a half-hour ain't hardly enough time to walk all the way there and back. - You leave that baby all alone? - Oh, no, ma'am. He stays with miss praill, this old woman downstairs, but I ain't so sure she's right in the head, 'cause she talks to herself and she keeps all these cats, but she's all I can afford right now. So, I was just thinkin', miss Cleo, that maybe if I didn't take no coffee breaks-- unh-uh. I can't do it. I let you start doing something different in here, and then every girl I got have her own brainstorm by morning! I'm sorry. I just can't do it. You better get back over there to Alice dickson before she starts to holler. Woman: So anyway, let me get back to that last story. So, anyway, I was sittin' in the front... It's okay, baby. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. We don't take children here. He's real good. He hardly cries at all, and I'll pay you anything. I don't care how much you pay. We don't take children here. Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am. I saw where you had a vacancy. No vacancy. No vacancy. - But the sign said-- - that vacancy was filled this morning. I just hadn't had time to take down the sign. Woman: Where are you goin' with that pretty red baby? You lost, child? You lookin' for the bus depot, you're walkin' the wrong way. Train station is clear on the other side of town. What are you gapin' at? You simple-minded or something? I asked you if you was lost! Well, come on up here if you can't hear me. Come on in. Whew. You mean to tell me you never thought of pluggin' up that rat hole with some steel wool until you could find a better place to live? - No, I just-- - you just up and left, huh? Ain't that a caution-- whew! Where's your husband? I ain't got one. Well, I had five, and I tell you-- ha! You ain't missin' much! Come on in here. Oh. Ooh. Whew! Sit down. Lord, he is heavy. How you tote him around all day? Mm-mm-mm. Ooh, look at them fat legs. You pretty red thing, you. I was always partial to reddish men. My second husband was his color. Boy, did he have a temper. Yeah, well, don't mind this mess. I don't have the strength I once had to keep it tidy. I guess y'all must be hungry, huh? But I don't even know your name. That mean you can't eat my food? You said you got to be properly introduced. That in the oven there is called "pot roast." And on the stove is string beans and white potatoes. And I think there's even a angel food cake here just waitin' to make your acquaintance. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful, it's just that this all happened so quick and I don't even know how much space you got here for US or how much you charge or anything. I'm Mattie Michael and this is basil. My name's Eva Turner. Most folk call me miss Eva. Oh. - Oh, let me help you. - Uh-huh. There we go. You like green onions on your string beans? - Basil, no. - Leave him be. He ain't botherin' nothin'. Them's lucielia's toys, and she's asleep. Who's lucielia? That's my grandbaby. My son's child. I had her since-- oh, since she was, uh, 6 months old. Parents just up and went to Tennessee, left her here. Neither one of them worth the spit it would take to curse them. Well. Can't blame her daddy none, though. He just like his father. That was my last husband, the one I should have never married. But, I was always partial to dark-skinned men. I thought you said before you were partial to-- ain't that a fact. Well, truth be told, I liked them all. They just don't agree with me. Like fried onions. Here. You like fried onion? What say I make US some liver and fried onions for sunday supper tomorrow? That'd be nice, ma'am, but you haven't told me how much it's gonna cost for US to stay here. Well, I ain't runnin' no boarding house, gal. This here's my home. I got the spare room, and you're welcome to stay. Well, I can't just stay here. I have to pay you something. Well, I'll think about it, and I'll-- I'll let you know. Here. Look at that pretty red thing. Eva: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm! Girl: I didn't do anything to your coloring book. I don't care about your color-- - boy: Still! - Girl: Why would I want your color-- - boy: But I didn't steal your crayon! - Oh, boy. Girl: No, I saw you do it! - Boy: I don't like crayons! - Girl: Yes, you do. Boy: I don't taste crayons. You taste them. I didn't touch your stupid coloring book. - Oh, yes you did. - No, I didn't. Ow! Ow! Ciel? Ciel? You narrow-tailed heifer! What you laughing at, mister? Huh? What me to get him for you? No, I want you two hellions out of my kitchen right now. Out! Out! I declare, can't we just have one morning of peace and quiet in this house? Mama, cielia tore my coloring book. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it! Listen, it's too early in the morning for this nonsense. I want both of you upstairs and washed for breakfast. You heard what she said, now get! Go on. Good morning. It ain't natural. Just ain't natural. Oh, they just bein' children, miss Eva. I ain't talkin' about them children, Mattie, I'm talking about you. Here you done spent another weekend holed up in this house. That is not true. Friday after work I went to choir practice, Saturday I took basil and ciel to the zoo and in a few minutes I'm fixin' to go to church. Mm-hmm. Well, I ain't heard you mention no man in all that excitement going on. When's the last time a man come by here to take you out? I been so busy, I ain't noticed. I have my hands full raising my son. When I was your age I as on my second husband. Well, now, miss Eva, i'da have to start 20 years ago to beat your record. Yeah, well, I ain't making no joke, girl. You never have no needs in that direction? Don't no young woman want an empty bed year in and year out. My bed hasn't been empty since basil was born. That boy needs his own bed and I been telling you that for years! And I been telling you he is afraid of the dark! All children's afraid of the dark. They get used to it. I am not gonna have my son screaming his head off all night long just to please you! He's still a baby and he does not like sleeping alone! Five years old ain't no baby! And you sure it's basil who don't wanna be alone? Now, you listen to me, old woman, just because we stay in your house don't mean you have the right to tell me how to raise my child. It's my house and I'll say what I want. Well, you tell me what I owe and I'll pay and we'll be out of your house before this week is over. - I ain't decided yet. - You been sayin' that for five years. And you been movin' every time I mention that spoiled brat of yours! You still saving my rent money in that bag, ain't ya? Of course. Good! 'Cause you gonna-- you gonna be usin' it to buy yourself some clothes to go to my funeral. That's if you plan on coming. You crazy old bitty. You think you can win every argument by talking 'bout your funeral. You too ornery to die and you know it. Yes. Folks say I am just about like that, ain't I? Well. You know, truth be told, I was thinkin' about staying 'round here about a hundred years. Hoo-hoo, lord, I couldn't stand you that long. Mm-hmm. Maybe 99 and a half. Mm-hmm. Lord it is hot in here, and that fan ain't doing nothin' but blowing the hot air around. Mattie, somebody wants you on the telephone. Thank you. Be right back. Hello? Oh, hi, honey. What's wrong? What? No. Just sit tight, I'll be right there. - Hey, mama. - Hey, miss Mattie. I can't even believe y'all been sitting out here all this time. Why didn't miss Eva meet y'all at the bus stop? Well, I guess she forgot. What is that old woman thinking about? Leaving y'all babies sittin' out here all this time. Y'all come on upstairs now. Take off your good clothes. And I don't wanna hear a peep out of ya. Come on. Basil: Peep, peep, peep, peep. - Go on upstairs. - Basil: Peep, peep... Wake up, old woman. You done gone to sleep and left them children. Miss Eva? Miss Eva? ♪ And I know ♪ he watches ♪ me ♪ His eye ♪ is on ♪ the sparrow ♪ and I know ♪ he watches ♪ me. Why does ciely have to go away with those people? They're her mama and daddy. She's gonna live with them. Where are we gonna live? We're gonna live here, just like miss Eva would have wanted. I'm gonna make the down payment with that rent money she never would take. And I'm gonna pay the mortgage the best way I can figure. You gonna have nice house and a yard to play in, if it's the last thing I do. What if those people decide to take me away like ciely? Oh, baby. Now, don't you worry about that, now. Nobody's gonna take you anywhere. You and me, we always gonna be together. I promise you that. Now, eat your food. Mattie: Basil, not so fast. You're gonna choke. - I got someplace to go. - Where you got to go? You been runnin' all weekend and you promised me today you were gonna stay and help me with this yard. Stop hassling me? I'm just going out for a little while. I told you I'd cut the damn grass, and I'll do it. All right, fine. Now, don't get yourself all worked up, you're gonna upset your stomach. I ain't gonna upset my stomach. Can I borrow a couple dollars to get some gas for the car? - Basil. - It's not for today. It's for tomorrow. I need it for job hunting. I don't get my check from the last place till Thursday and I don't wanna waste four days sittin' around here doin' nothing. Fine. You know I'm not the kind of man to sit around and let a woman support him. Although, I would make a pretty good hustler, don't you think? Fine. You just tell them that down at the unemployment office. Basil, where'd you say you were going? Hello? Basil: Mama, it's me. Mama, you gotta come get me. You gotta help me. Basil? Where are you? What's wrong? They beat me up, mama. Those bastards beat me up. Who beat you up, basil? Where are you? I'm in jail. Mama, you gotta listen to me. It was an accident. I didn't mean to kill nobody! Mama, can you hear me? I didn't mean it! Mama? Mama? Basil, honey. Are you all right? Yeah, mama, I'm terrific. I never felt better. - Baby, your face. - Ow! Well, that's great. Make it hurt worse. I'm sorry, I didn't mean-- when am I getting out of here? Well, honey, I'm working on that. Reverend Kelly's found US a good lawyer. He says there's nothin' to worry about. Well, fine. So, when do I get out? Well, there's some kind of hearing tomorrow and then they tell US when you go to trial. Mama, I don't see why there's got to be a trial. It was an accident. And that guy was pickin' on me over some broad. I didn't even know him. I know, honey, but a man is dead. There's got to be some kind of proceeding about that. Yeah, well, he's better off than me. The cops beat me up and threw me in this hell hole. They say you resisted arrest, basil, and you broke a policeman's wrist. So, what? They had no right arresting me for something that wasn't my fault! And what are you doin'? Sticking up for them? Basil. I ain't sticking up for nobody, it's just that, we gotta face this thing so we can see our way clear from it. What "we," mama? It's me. I'm stuck in here, not you. You're home in a clean house. I'm stuck here in this filthy place with rats crawling under my bed. Honey, as soon as they tell US the bail tomorrow I'm gonna put it up and you'll be out. Why tomorrow, mama? Why can't you put it up today and not make me have to spend another night in this place? 'Cause they won't take it till tomorrow. There's nothing we can do but wait. Okay, fine. If you can't, you can't. Basil, honey? We still got time. Don't you want to sit and talk? There ain't nothin' left to talk about, mama. Unless you want to hear about the broken toilets that ain't been flushed in three days. Or the bedbugs that have ate up my back. Or this greasy food I keep throwing up. Other than that, I got nothing else to say to you. The trial is set for December 1, which is two weeks from today, on the charges of involuntary manslaughter, resisting arrest and assault of a peace officer. Bail is set for $25, 000. Motion to suspend or reduce bail, your honor. - Denied. - Your honor, given that this is this young man's first offense I'm aware of the circumstances, Mr. Garvin. Motion is denied. Judge: Next. I'm sorry, miss Michael, but at least we got an early trial date. And the d.A. Assures me that they won't go so heavily on the assault charge if we drop the implication of undue force. There's no way that your son shouldn't be free in 15 days. I want to post bail. Now, I understand your concern. But it's for a very short period of time, and I'm really not so sure that your assets-- my house is paid for. Can't I put that up? Yes, you can. Then that's what I'll do. You do understand that the purpose of bail is to ensure that the defendant appears before trial? Now, if you forfeit the bail-- I understand. All right. I'll get you the papers from the bonding company. I swear, basil, you done more work in the past two weeks than you done in a whole lifetime put together. Mama, I'm so happy to be a free man, I'd cut the grass with my teeth. Well, I got to hurry up and make me a list of what I need done around here, before all this gratitude runs out. Hello. Oh, hello, Mr. Garvin. Yes, sir. Friday, 9:00. We'll be there. Thank you for calling. Damn. I'll blow my brains out before I spend my life in jail, mama. Basil, stop talking stupidness. Now, you ain't goin' to jail, 'cause you ain't done nothing to go to jail for. The lawyer said so and he ought to know. You think that uncle Tom lawyer cares what happens to me? Mama, he'll say anything to get your money. If somebody offered him a nickel more than you did he'd throw me in jail personally and swallow the key. Then what about the jury? They bound to see the truth. The jury? Mama, that jury's gonna be so white you're gonna think we just had a heavy snowfall. I don't care how white they are! They gotta listen to the evidence. Ain't a white man alive gonna pass up a chance to put a black man in jail, mama. - You don't know people like I do. - Basil. And they ain't gonna send me to no county jail this time. They'll send me to someplace a lot worse. I couldn't stand it, mama. I just couldn't. I'm making your favorite dinner tonight. Creamed chicken and rice. Does that help? Yeah, mama. That helps a lot. You have a good day. Now, you do what I told you. Last time I came in here, you didn't do what I told you to do. That's 'cause you told me to make you look like Lena horne. And that's what I want. Alfreda, honey, I have to work with what you bring in here. Woman: There they are. Hi. - Driver: How's it goin'? - Woman: Come along, come along. Woman: Mattie? Mattie. Ciel? - Mattie. - Ciel. - Oh, Mattie! - Ciel! Look at you! Look at you. It's so good to see you. - I'm so sorry about basil. - Hush. We're not gonna talk about that, now. You look good. How you been? Oh, I'm fine. Oh, I just can't believe you're here. Yeah. I can't believe it myself. Ciel: Mattie! Come here. I got a surprise for you. Child, I'm too old for surprises. Woman, you better get yourself in here. I got all your pictures hung. What do you think? Hey, baby girl. You come to see Mattie? You come to see me, your pretty little-- Mattie! Ciel, why are you so worried about what myapartment look like? Because i-- I know you don't like it here... Very much, and i-- it's my fault you're here. It ain't your fault and you know it. Besides, if I hadn't had you, I don't know where I would have gone. You need to stop wasting your worrying on me and worry up a daddy for this child. Serena has a daddy. Lord, there for Cora Lee and miss Sophie again. Well, if she got a daddy, how come I been here all this time and I ain't seen him? I told you, he's off looking for work. Hmm. How long did you say he been gone? Mattie, there was nothin' for him here. What else could he do? I swear I get so tired of listening to those two, I don't know what to do. Could y'all please keep it down? People can't even hear themselves think. Them brats of yours been squealing and hollering in front of my door the whole day. I'm gonna call the police, you hear me? Now, y'all hear that? Y'all just get in there! I told 'em, but their damn heads are as hard as rocks. Well, you can just tell that to the police when they get here. If the police can talk some sense into those morons, all right with me! 'Cause lord knows, I can't do nothin' with them. Well, you should have thought of that before you started breeding them like roaches! There ain't no two of 'em got the same daddy anyway. That is, if you even know who the daddys are! Ain't none of your damn business! Excuse me. Get in there, I said. Get in there. What is this thing made of? Well, it's probably the dirt. I ain't cleaned it since I bought it. Why doesn't that surprise me? Let's just put it here. Have you ever vacuumed this thing? For that I'd have to own a vacuum, right? - Abshu. - Shoot me. I'm a bachelor. Well, if you think you're gonna live here and be a slob, - you're in for a rude awakening. - I don't think i'm-- if you think you're gonna sit on the couch and watch football games while I clean the apartment, and cook dinner-- kiswana, I don't even like football. And I'm a better cook than you are. What's wrong with you, baby? I don't know. I just don't want US to be my parents. And how is that gonna happen? We wouldn't be living here if we were your parents, right? Right. Man on TV: And now... Y'all go! Y'all stop that. This is messing up my picture! All right, all right, that's it. I'm-- now, get out of here. All, y'all. I'm sick and tired of you. Wait a minute. Doesn't anyone have any homework? All: Not me. Awful strange no one ever has any homework. When I was in school, we always had homework. And we didn't get left back like you little dumbasses. Woman on TV: If only we could be like this together forever. Girl: Wow! What y'all children starin' at? Man: Hey, girl. Don't walk away. Hey, girl, you hear me talkin' to you. Where you goin'? Lord. Oh, child. Thank you. Whew! The younger I get, the harder those steps seem to reach. I don't know why you got to tote these records everywhere, as much as you move around. It's good to see you, too. Whew. Lord. I've been driving since sunup. I thought you said you were gonna take a plane. I was, but when I said I was heading home simeon got so ornery, he wouldn't give me no money for the plane. So, I asked him for half, so I could, you know, take the train. Wouldn't even do that. And Mattie, I'll be damned if I come back to this city on that raggedy old bus. I ain't forgot how folks talked about me last time I did that. So, I wait till simeon came by my house all drunk up and snoring, took the car and the registration... Here I am. You stole the man's car? "Stole," hell! He owed me that! And then some. You'll have a hard time explaining that to the police. I'm surprised the highway patrol ain't stopped you. They ain't stopped me because simeon didn't report it. How do you know that? 'Cause the sheriff of that county is his wife's daddy and he'd have a lot of explaining to do. Well, he could just say you picked his pockets. Oh yeah? Have to be a damn good pickpocket to get away with these. Ooo! Girl, I'm through with you. I'm through with you! Both: Whoo! At least you could have washed 'em. ♪ You'll be mine in the morning ♪ Here you go. Corn. ♪ Oh, and be mine... ♪ Again in the night ♪ We'll always, I mean always ♪ ♪ be together ♪ because our love, yes, our love ♪ ♪ will be right ♪ to love... Hi, baby. ♪ And to be loved forever ♪ ♪ let's make a vow ♪ to never... Hi, baby. ♪ Ever part. Oh... it's you. Let me look at you. Ciel: Whew! I ain't get enough sleep last night. Hm. So, he's back? And what does that mean? Hm. Don't mean nothing. I was just observin' that the man is back. So, you think I'm a fool, don't you? I ain't said that. Bible said, "judge not." Then why don't that apply to gene, Mattie? Why are you so mad at me? I done told you it's your life. Can we walk and talk about her life at the same time? This bag is heavy. Mattie, you just don't understand. He's got a new job down at the docks. He was just depressed before about a new baby and no work. Uh-huh. I know. Listen, he just went to the store to get some paint so he could fix up the apartment and stuff. He's really making an effort. You'll see. Besides, my child needs a daddy. Ciel, you ain't got to convince me. Don't sound to me like you the one she' trying to convince. Hi, mom, it's kiswana. Melanie. No, no, nothing's wrong. I just called to say hi. I'm going to get a phone. I just haven't gotten around to it. I'm not out in the streets, and it's broad daylight. How do you know anything about this neighborhood? You've never even seen it. What kind of people, mama? Black people? Mama-- mama, just-- never mind. I have to go. A mad rapist wants to use the phone. So, trustin' you stay out of jail, what do you intend to do now? I guess I could get a couple thousand for the car. That'll tide me over till my next business opportunity comes along. You and your business opportunities. Why don't you just settle down and get yourself a regular job? A job? Doing what? What kind of experience I got? Nothin' that's gonna get me a regular job. - You don't know that. - I do know it. And why you on me? I ain't heard nothing about you working. Child, what I got to work for? Them days is behind me. Oh, Mattie, I don't need no job. What I need is to find me a good man, then live quietly until I'm old age. Mm-hmm. So, where you planning on findin' a good man? That's the part I got to figure out. Problem is, all the decent men is either dead or waiting to be born. Etta, why don't you go to meetin' with me tonight? What are you gonna do, pray me up a man? There's a few decent, settle-minded men in our church, widowers and such. Besides, a little prayer wouldn't hurt your soul a bit. I thank you to leave my soul out of this. Besides, since your church got all the fine Christian men, how come you ain't snapped one yet? Child, I done banked them fires a long time ago. Seein' as how you still keepin' up steam... I done called the police at least three times on c.C. And that crowd, sellin' drugs by that wall. Well, that's three calls you done wasted. Mattie: Beats all I ever seen. Just disgraceful. Ciel: Ain't that the truth. - Hi. - Ciel: Hi. My name is kiswana browne. I live in apartment 312. Oh, yeah. You moved in the other day. I saw you. No, actually I moved in a few weeks ago. The other day my boyfriend was moving in. A rug for me. Anyway, what i'm trying to do is, I'm trying to get people interested in starting a tenants' association. Mattie: A who? Well, the way it works, is-- did you know that almost every building on this street is owned by the same man? And if we just-- I'm sorry, that little boy is eating out of the garbage. Sophie: That's one of Cora Lee's little hellions. You lucky he ain't doing worse. Man on TV: Doctor... Now what? I'm gonna miss Rachel coming out her coma. Man #2 on TV: I've seen cases like this before. Some patients do survive... - Kiswana: Hi. - Mama, I ain't done nothin'. Would you tell this damn fool I ain't done nothin'? - What a way to talk! - I ain't done nothin'! Missy, I'm sorry, did he steal something from you? He's always taking things. I've whupped him for it but he won't stop. I've tried to tell the dumbass his teachers are threatening to send him to reform school. You hear that, you dumb head? Reform school! Wait, it's nothing like that. He was downstairs eating out of the garbage and I thought you should know because... well, he might be hungry or something. I know he does that. He's looking for sweets. The dentist at the clinic said all his teeth are rotten, so I won't give him anything sweet. So, he go huntin' through the garbage, looking for candy. Now, I've tried to make him stop, but you can't be everywhere at once. I figure once he gets sick from that filthy habit, he'll stop by himself. Girl: Give me my money. Serena, give it here! Believe me, my kids get plenty to eat. I got two full books of food stamps I ain't even used. I was just about to cook dinner when you came through the door. - Oh. - Y'all come on in here. It's almost time to eat. Y'all hear me? I said get in here or you're gonna be damn sorry. Don't worry. I take care of these crews. I swear, I could introduce etta to god and she'd find something wrong with him. Well, you tried. I'm gonna keep trying, too. I'm tired of watching that girl run all over the globe looking for something she ain't gonna never find. Why are you so quiet? You feelin' bad today? I been feelin' bad all week. Why don't you go to the doctor? I did. What'd he say? He said I was pregnant. Ain't that a caution. Mattie, try not to get yourself all worked up. No, I'm happy for ya. Really. That child could use a brother or sister to play with, just like you and-- just like me and who, Mattie? You know, since the day you called to tell me about basil, I haven't once heard you mention his name. That ain't the subject. We was talkin' about the baby. I think it would be good if you talked about basil. It can't help you to keep it all bottled up. There ain't nothin' to talk about. It's over and done. Does gene know about that baby? I told him as soon as I found out. He packin' yet? Mattie, I got enough problems. I don't need you and your cantankerous moods. Everything's gonna be all right. You'll see. Fine. I'll see. You're home early. You see anybody else in here? Gene, the baby's sleeping. Listen, can't a man even relax in his own home without everybody pickin' on him? I'm not picking on you. I just don't want you to wake the baby. What about me, huh? What, don't I matter around here no more? No, I'll tell you what the answer to that is-- hell no. Everybody's more important than me. Your friends, the baby. Hell, I ain't nothin' 'round here no more. I don't care what she says. A kid doesn't eat garbage unless he's hungry. And besides, c.C. Baker and that gang out there in the alley? A kid that age has no business being out there alone. Anything could happen. Maybe you should tell Cora Lee that. And that apartment. Trash everywhere. Dirty dishes piled up all over the sink. Kids running wild, I don't even know how many. And I swear, all she cared about was that I was interrupting her soap opera. I'm sure it's a little bit more complicated than that. Oh, that's great. My mother's gonna love that. Kiswana, you can't expect people who live here under these conditions to think and act like the people you grew up around. I grew up in an area just like this. I know what it's like. Abshu, I'm not completely naive. I didn't expect this to be linden hills. I just thought that these people would be a little bit more-- I don't know. - I expected them to care. - What makes you think they don't? What are you gonna do, write off the woman as a human being because she got dirty dishes in her sink? I've known people like Cora Lee my whole life. All I'm saying is, I'm not sure how to help someone like Cora Lee. You gotta find a way, and baby, if you can't find a way, you gotta make a way. Come here. Listen, these people have had the life beaten out of them for years. You can't change something like that overnight. But you can't run away from a problem 'cause there's no easy answer, either. That's what everyone else does. And baby, you and I, we're supposed to be different. I lost my job today. Will you tell me how the hell we supposed to make it now? I don't know. I'll get a second job. You can find another job. It'll be okay. That ain't gonna do it this time, ciel. We ain't got no money coming in, we got another baby on the way. - How are we gonna make it? - I don't know. We'll be fine. No, it ain't gonna be fine. Look, I'm doin' the best I can right now. - I know that, honey. - Ciel, I'm just tired of US never getting ahead. Oh, baby. When I have this baby, I'll get my tubes tied. Ciel, what the hell are we supposed to feed it when it gets here? Hm? Air? - Wait-- - just babies and bills. Babies and bills. That's all you good for. I'm telling you, with two kids and you on my back, ciel, I ain't gonna never have nothin'. You hear me? Nothin'. Nothin'. I got a hole in my bathroom wall as big as my head. Don't you mean you got a hole in your head as big as your bathroom wall? You in the mood for a joke today, miss lady? Why don't you take a look in the mirror? Why don't y'all shut up and let the girl talk? Why don't you shut up? We hear your mouth over everybody's. I don't know how you hear anything over yours. Okay, everyone, everyone, please. If we all talk at once, we're not gonna accomplish anything. Well, wait a minute, I wanna know, what's Ben doing here? He works for the landlord. You know I lives here just like the rest of y'all. Y'all ain't got no heat, I ain't neither. So, what? You stays too zooted to get cold anyway. The landlord don't throw garbage in the air shaft, and he don't break the glass in the door. And how about that riffraff that hang out in the alley, selling drugs back there by that wall? Ain't nothin' no good going on back there by that wall. It's just a gathering place for lowlifes. That damn wall blocks all my sun. I can't get a cactus to grow in my apartment. Okay, you're all gonna get a chance to voice your concerns, I promise. The thing is, we've gotta do this in a constructive manner or we're just wasting our time. It's just like that wall you're all so upset about. That wall does what that wall is supposed to do. It closes US in. It holds US back. It shuts US off from the rest of the world. Man: You know, she's right. Woman: Uh-huh. Now, we can get to the other side, but we've gotta climb over it, or go around it, or just knock it down. We're never gonna get anywhere if we just stand and bang our heads against it. - Woman: All right,girl. - Does that make any sense? Well, I still say Ben's got no business being here. Lot of folks got no business being here. Why you gotta pick on one old wino? I ain't banging my head against nothing. Woman: Well, if y'all ain't gonna do nothin but fight, I'd rather be home watchin' my TV. I'm missing my stories.

I knew you'd come home soon as I got this child ready to go to sleep. Why you so late today? Thought you got off early on Tuesday. I got off real early today. I been to see a doctor. Anything wrong? Not anymore. Ciel. Mattie, it's for the best. I still got Serena and I'm still young. I got plenty of time. It's just that gene's been trying so hard to get on his feet and he couldn't take one more thing. Now, I know you don't think much of gene but he is my husband and I gotta think about what's best for him, and this was for the best. I don't wanna hear any more about it. Won't say another word. Oh, my god. Woman: Melanie? Melanie? - Mama! - Hi, baby. Thank you. I thought you were someone calling for the people next door, since no one calls me Melanie anymore. Honey, to me, if you get a name, you answer to it your whole life. How in the world do you get up all those steps - with groceries and laundry? - Well, i-- well, I guess when you're young it doesn't bother you - like it does an old woman like me. - I guess. I would have called before I came, - except you have no telephone. - I'm working on it. Actually, I really didn't expect to find you home. I thought you would be out job hunting. I'm going to. In fact, I was just checking the ads. That sounds like a good idea. Since when have you ever had experience as a forklift operator? My hand must have slipped. I meant to circle "file clerk." Baby. Are you sure you haven't been sitting here daydreaming again? God, mama, I haven't done that in years. When are you gonna realize that i'm a grown woman now? Please, have a seat. Thank you. I will. I must say, you have fixed this place up nicely. Really, mama? Well, considering what you have to work with. Look, I know it's not linden hills, but I think it has a lot of potential. As soon as they come and paint, I'm gonna hang my ashanti print over the couch, and I thought a big Boston fern would go well in that corner. What do you think? I think that's very fine, baby, very fine. Thank you. I just wish you'd put in a telephone so your father and I wouldn't have to worry so much. Mama, I'm going to get a phone. It's just that they want $75 for a deposit, and I can't swing that right now. Melanie, I can give you the money. I don't want you giving me money. I want to make it myself. - Then let me lend it to you. - No. I think it's downright selfish of you the way you make US worry so much. Worry about what? I'm fine! Melanie, anything can happen to you living over here with these people. What do you mean, "these people"? They're my people, mama, and yours, too. Or have you forgotten that over in linden hills? That's not what I meant and you know it. I mean, these streets, this house-- it's so shabby and run down. This is how poor people live. You're not poor, Melanie. No, mama, you'renot poor. You're the one with a husband in real estate, with a five-figure income and a house in linden hills. All I've got is my unemployment and an overdrawn checking account. This is all I can afford. You could afford much more if you hadn't dropped out of college. Yeah, I knew it. I knew you'd get around to that. You'll just never understand, will you? - Understand what, baby? - That my place is here, with my people Melanie, what help could you possibly be to these people while you're living hand-to-mouth on a file clerk's check? Well, at least I'm here, in day-to-day contact with my people, instead of being like you and daddy and sitting over in linden hills with a terminal case of middle class amnesia. You don't have to live in the slums to care, Melanie. You don't have to try to be something you're not. Oh, god. I can't stand this. Trying to be something I'm not? Trying to be proud of my African heritage? If that's being something I'm not, then fine! I'd rather be dead than be like you. A stuck-up nigger who's ashamed of being black. My grandmother was a full-blooded iroquois. My grandfather was a black from a long line of journeymen who lived in Connecticut since the establishment of the colonies. My father was a bajan who came to this country a cabin boy in a merchant mariner. I know all of that, mama. Then know this! I am alive because of the blood of a people who never scraped or begged or apologized for what they were. They asked only one thing of this world-- to be allowed to be. And I learned, through the blood of these people, that black isn't beautiful. It isn't ugly. It isn't kinky hair, it isn't straight hair. Black is just black! It broke my heart when you changed your name. I gave you my grandmother's name, a woman who bore nine children and educated them all. Who held off six white men with a shotgun when they tried to drag one of her sons off to jail for not knowing his place. And you had to reach into an African dictionary to find a name that would make you proud. When I brought my babies home from the hospital, I swore to whatever gods would listen that I would use everything I had or could get so that my children would be prepared to meet this world on its own terms. So that no one could make them ashamed of what they were or how they looked. Whatever they were! However they looked! And Melanie, that's not white or red or black or purple. That's being a mother. Mama. It's gonna be trouble. What is? Them two. Just moved in. You were not. You just didn't want to do double dancing. No, no, you didn't want to do single dancing. - That's not true. - You said no. No, singular. Two young girls livin' by themselves. What kind of trouble? You name it. First thing is, they gonna be throwin' loud parties and keepin' everybody up all night. Both: Hello. They ain't been here two weeks and I ain't heard a peep out of them. They just have to settle in first. What do you think they bought all them groceries for? Dinner? Go ahead, make all the fun you want, but you just Mark my words, they'll be trouble. Yes! What is it? Oh, it's you. I thought it was that damn old blue-haired coot miss Sophie. No. Y'all, hush up that racket right now. Some days I just don't know. Well, I'm sorry to bother you, but the other day I forgot to mention that I'm trying to start a tenants' association on this block and I thought you might be interested. - Uh-huh. - I don't know if you know this, but all the buildings on this street are owned by the same man and if we pull together, we can put pressure on him to start fixing up the place. Once we get the association rolling we can even stage a rent strike and do the repairs ourselves. I want you to check off on this sheet all the things that are wrong with your apartment. Then I'm gonna take these forms and file them at the housing court. There's plenty wrong with this place, but ain't no piece of paper gonna fix it. Well, if we can get enough people-- - Is it okay if I come in for a minute? - Oh, sure. These kids got me so rattled, I forgot my manners. Well, I've already been to four of the buildings and the response has been really great. In fact, we're having our next meeting this Saturday morning at 10:00. Oh, I don't know. You know, it's hard to keep the place clean with these kids tearing it up all the time. - I know what you mean. - You got kids then? No, but my brother has two and he says that they can be quite a handful. Well, I got a lot more than that, so you can just imagine what I go through. If they could just stay babies. They so sweet. And they just love you. They don't talk back. When I was a little girl, I used to love a baby doll. I had ten sisters and brothers. It was hard for my parents to do for all of US, but every Christmas I got me a new baby doll. Until I was 13 and my daddy said I was too old. I had all the old ones, but it just wasn't the same as the new ones. They way they feel, the way they smell. I'd just hold them and smell them and think, "this is my baby. She's all mine and I'm all hers and we got each other, no matter what happens." That's the way I feel about my real babies. They so tiny and new and helpless. And then they grow up and turn into these little dumbasses. Yeah, you laughin' now, brucie? I told you a million times to stop swingin' on my curtains, - so good for you. - He might have hurt his head. No, he's always falling from something. His head is hard as a rock. That curtain rod is shot. I ain't got no money to replace any of-- them drapes can just stay down, for all I care. There's a big knot coming up on the side of his head. - Maybe we should-- - it'll go down. Look, if I went runnin' to the hospital every time one of these kids bumped their heads, I would spend the rest of my life in the emergency room. You just don't know. They wild and disgusting - and you can't do nothing with them. - Ow! See what I mean? Well, they're probably that way from being cramped up in the apartment. Kids need space to move around. There is plenty of space in the schoolyard for them to play, but will they go to school? And the last time I let them go to the park, somebody gave Sammy a reefer. Now, if I let them go to that park, I'll have a bunch of junkies on my hands. Look, I got your piece of paper, I will look it over, but I'm sorry, I've got a million things to do. You'll have to come back another time. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to keep you. I wasn't trying to tell you how to raise your children-- yeah, I know. It's just that I'm busy right now. You know, there are a lot of good things that go on around here, too. Yeah? Like what? Well, my boyfriend's gotten a Grant from the city and he's putting on a black production of Shakespeare's "a midsummer night's dream" at the community center. Maybe you could come and bring the children. "Abshu Ben-Jamal productions." Maybe come this Saturday afternoon. The kids'll love it. I don't know. That Shakespeare stuff-- they won't understand and they'll start acting up and embarrass me in front of all those people. No, it's funny and it's colorful and it has fairies. I mean, all kids like stories with fairies. So, what if they don't understand every word? - I don't know. - Oh, come on. I'll come get you and we can walk over together. How about 1:30, so we get good seats? Yeah, all right, 1:30. Great. Maybe your husband would like to come, too. I ain't married. Um... Your boyfriend? I ain't got no real boyfriend. Oh. I mean, I usually got a couple of men friends that come by and see me. It gets lonely with nothin' but the kids around here. I'm sure. Well, anyway, I'll see you on Saturday. It'll be fun, you'll see. Isn't she beautiful, Mattie? Yes, I could just look at her for the rest of my life and be happy. She sure is a pretty little thing. Hey, listen. You wouldn't believe the words she knows. She even knows her daddy's name, huh? "Dada gene." "Dada gene." Better teach her your name. She'll be using it a lot more often. Hi, honey. How you doin', gene? Ciel, I wanna talk to you. Why don't I, um, take Serena next door? I got some ice cream. She can stay right there. If she need ice cream, I'll buy her ice cream. It's, uh, almost naptime, Mattie. I'll bring her over later. Y'all keep good. Okay. You too, gene. Why the hell is she always over here? You had your chance. Why didn't you ask her? Now, look, I ain't got time to be arguing with you about that old hag. Now, ciel, I got big doings in the making. I'ma need you to help me pack. Hey, sweetheart. Play for mommy. It's a really good deal, ciel. I never expected to find nothin' this good, especially after being out of work for so long. What deal? Where are you going? Maine, which really ain't that far. Once I get settled in on the docks up there, I'll be able to come home all the time. Well, why don't you take US with you? No, I got to go check out what's happening up there first myself, before I go draggin' you and the kid up there. We don't mind. We'll make do. We don't need much. It ain't gonna work out, ciel. I got to go see my way clear first. - Eugene, please! - No! Now, that's the end of it. Well, how far is it? Where'd you say you were going? I told you, I'm going up to the docks in Newport. No, that's not Maine. You said Maine! I made a mistake, that's all. Ciel: How'd you find out about a place so far up? - Who got you the job? - My friend. - What friend? - None of your damn business! Ciel: You leavin' here, that's my business! - Now, who told you? - It ain't nobody that you know, ciel. - What difference does it make? - It don't sound right to me. I don't give a damn how it sound to you. I'm going, now that's that. Suppose you get up there and there's no job? I won't be no worse off than I am right now. Did this friend give you a number or something? What are trying to say, my friend is lying? I don't know! I don't even know who your friend is! See, I told you, it ain't none of your damn business. Ciel: You're lying, aren't you? You don't have a job, do you? You can think whatever you want, ciel, I'm going! No, you can't go, gene! No, you can't go! - Why? - Because I love you! Well, that ain't gonna be enough. Serena! Oh, Serena! Woman: Saddest thing I ever heard. Woman #2: I can hardly believe it. Woman #3: Somebody needs to call down home... Woman: You don't think to leave a baby like that... I know just how she feels. I lost one of my own a few years back. The lord works in mysterious ways, and he don't ever close the door without opening up a window. Woman: Oh, my goodness. Woman #2: Did someone feed her? Woman #3: I took her a plate, but she didn't want it. Etta Mae: Ciel. Ciel. Ciel. I think you'd feel a lot better if you'd go out there and be with people. At least let someone come in here and sit with you. You get her to eat that, you'll be doing a lot better than me. Ciel. Come on, have a little bit of this. Ciel, you ain't had a bite to eat in three days now. Doctor say you gotta eat something. If you don't like it, you can spit it out. Etta Mae: Well, the nurse said it was normal for her not to be hungry. I don't care what the nurse say. This ain't normal. Anybody know where gene is out on his sorry butt? No, but wherever it is, he better damn well keep it there. Mattie, that child is burning up with fever. She won't eat, she won't sleep. What's she trying to do, kill herself? I think that's exactly what she's trying to do. Well, if you want my opinion, I think she's gonna do it. Now, maybe you can do something with her. I sure can't. Ciel, I promise you, you leave this world it's gonna be over my dead body. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on back. Come on back. Come on back. Come on back. Come on. Come on! Come on, damn it! That's right, child. That's right. That's right, child. That's right. That's right. That's right, child. That's right. Get back into bed. My little girl is gone. I had a little boy, Mattie. It ain't true, baby. You got yourself. You got yourself. You got yourself. Why do we got to take baths? Is grandma coming? I told you, we going to see a play. I don't wanna see no play. Yes, you do! Dierdre, you can not wear them socks. They got holes in them. I always wear them to school. Well, you can't wear them today. Now, go put on the ones I fixed. Dorian, sit your butt down in that tub. Okay, now nobody move till I say "move." Hi. Well, doesn't everyone look nice? So, are we ready? Okay, let's go. Boy: I'll race you! Girl: Wait for me! Walk! - Man: Hey, miss Cora Lee. - Good afternoon, everybody. Woman: Is it easter already? All: Hello, miss Sophie. Where are all y'all going all dressed up? To the community center... For Shakespeare. Hi, everybody. My name is abshu Ben-Jamal and I'd like to welcome y'all. Now, how's everybody doing? I don't hear anything out there. What's happening? I don't think there's anybody here, guys. Let's come back another day. - Audience: No! - Oh, that's more like it! Making some progress. Now, is everybody here ready to have a good time? - Audience: Yeah! - Yeah! Okay. We're gonna see a play today. How many of you have seen a play before? Not a football play, not a basketball play, a stage play. Nobody? Well, that's great. 'Cause you're all gonna get to see your first play together. Now I'm gonna tell you a little bit about it, but before I do, if any of you have to go to the bathroom, go now. Okay, this play is called "a midsummer night's dream." It was written by a famous writer named William Shakespeare. Anybody hear of William Shakespeare? Good, a few of you. Okay, well the story takes place a long, long time ago in a place called Athens, which you probably never heard of. Uhn-uh. You heard of New York City, right? - Yeah! - Yeah, I thought so. Okay, well it's not near there either. But it's okay, 'cause we've added a few modern touches. See, it was very important to Mr. Shakespeare that people understood his plays on their own level. So, we're not here to make you feel like you're in school. We're just here to make sure you have a good time, okay? All: Okay! Okay, enjoy the play, all right? Okay! "Now, fair hippolyta, our nuptial hour draws on apace. Four happy days bring in another moon. But, oh, methinks how slow this old moon wanes!" They'll be fine, don't worry. "She lingers my desires, like a stepdame or a dowager long withering out a young man's revenue."

Oh, ciel. Deliver US! Deliver US from this sinful world of pain and sorrow. Minister: Yes, Jesus! Yes, Jesus! Yes, Jesus! Deliver US from the miseries of our own making as well as those miseries made for US - by others. - Yes! Hear me say it. Hear me say it. Hear me! Deliver US into a world where tears and suffering are only a distant memory, where we shall weep no more! Where we shall weep no more! Where we shall weep no more! - Yes, yes, yes, lord. - Mm-hmm. Mattie, that's not your regular minister. No, child, rev. Woods only visit on occasion. Can't he preach good? What do you know about him? He married? I should have known is wasn't the sermon that was movin' ya. Yes! ...until there is no room, no room. Mm-hmm. Not even that great big world out there that exacts such a strange penalty for my being born black. - Whoo! - For my being born black. For my being born black! For my being born black. I sure did enjoy that sermon, rev. Woods. I especially like the part about throwing away temptation to preserve the soul. Thought that was a mighty fine point. The lord moves me and I speak, sister Michael. I'm just a humble instrument for his voice. Oh, you're too humble, reverend. It's been a long time since I heard preachin' like that. Well, thank you very much, sister, uh-- excuse me, I'm about to forget my manners. This here is an old friend of mine, etta Mae Johnson. Etta Mae, reverend woods. Pleased to meet you, sister Johnson. It's just a shame Mrs. Woods wasn't here tonight to hear you preach. Oh, she must be mighty proud of your work. My wife has gone on to her glory. I think of myself now as a man alone, rest her soul. Yes, rest her soul. Please, rest it. I mean, this life is so hard, she's better off in the arms of the lord. Yes, I can testify to that. It's even harder when you're a woman alone. Sometimes I don't know where to turn. Well, if I can be of any assistance, sister-- in fact, if there's anything you'd like to discuss this evening, I'd be glad to escort you home. Or perhaps we could all go for coffee? I'm sorry, reverend, we're gonna have to decline your offer. I'm afraid these services have US all tired out. Actually, I think a cup of coffee is just what I need. I'll have to take you up on that. Good, good. Let me just say good-bye to a few more people, and I'll, uh, meet you outside. Reverand! You need to put a patent on that speed of yours and sell it to the airplane companies. Oh, hush up. If you'd batted them lashes any faster, we'd have had a dust storm up in there. What is wrong? You said you wanted me to meet some nice man. - I met on. - I meant a nice settling-down man. You carrying on like some kind of school girl. Can't you see what he got on his mind? The only thing I see is you telling me that I'm not good enough for a man like that. Oh, no, not etta Johnson. No upstanding, decent man could ever see anything in her but a quick good time. Well, let me tell you something, Mattie Michael, I've always traveled first class. Maybe not in a way you would approve of, with all you fine Christian principles, but it's done all right by me. And I'm gonna keep going, top drawer, until the day I leave this earth. Don't you think I got me a mirror. Each year there's a new line to be covered. I lay down with this body and I get up with it every morning. And every day it cries for a little more rest than the day before. Well, I'm gonna get me that rest, Mattie. And it's gonna be with a fine man like the rev. Woods. And all you slack-mouthed gossips in Brewster can just be damned. You know, I always have known what they say about me behind my back, Mattie. But...i never thought that you'd be right up there with em'. Well, y'all all gonna be humming a different tune when I show up the wife of a big preacher. Wife? Child, you can't be that blind. Etta, that man has got one thing on his mind, and it ain't marrying you. How do you know? What in the hell could you possibly know about that? I'll see you when you get home. Miss Johnson. My car is right here. Are you a believer in fate, miss Johnson? Fate? Destiny. Things meant to happen. People meant to meet. I noticed you from the pulpit. Couldn't take my eyes off you, to tell the truth. I don't run across a lot of women as beautiful as you in my line of work. Seems like the ones who keep coming to church stop caring about much else. I don't know. Anyway, I was hoping I'd have a chance to get to know you better. And here we are. Just like it was fate. Sure, I believe in fate. Why not? Etta Mae: God and me ain't never had a lot to say to each other, if you want the honest truth. But maybe I just ain't been listening hard enough, because every now and then, something will happen. Like tonight. You-- you think your life is heading one way and it don't look so good, and all of a sudden somebody says, "nothing's set in stone, sister. It ain't too late to start down a different road." Maybe that's how god works. He-- he sends you crosses to bear, and then, and then he rewards you with another chance. What do you think? I didn't hear you get up. Yeah, is there, uh, someplace I can drop you off? ♪ There comes a time, baby well, thanks for that cup of coffee, reverand. That's what I like about you worldly women.

Whew! Them two sure do shop a lot. Where do you reckon they get all of that money from? Who? Etta Mae: Oh, yeah. I keep meaning to make them a pie. Or something. Anyway, it keeps slippin', what's left of my mind. Careful, we don't wanna lose you. - I'm so clumsy lately. - Lately? So, that's it! What? They're... You know-- that way! - You think so? - Did you see the way they was up in each other's faces? I thought they was gonna kiss each other smack on the mouth. Etta Mae: Sophie, I ain't noticed nothing like that. Child, if they had, I would have thrown right up. Now, hush, Sophie. There you go startin' rumors. My mama used to say, "if you wallow with dogs, you gonna get up with fleas." What is that supposed to mean? It supposed to mean that the truth ain't no rumor. Now, y'all just keep an eye out on them them two 'cause I know what I'm talking about. Oh, my. Check the butter, is that the idea? Smell it, taste it, and see if you live. Where is it? Whew. - Smells good to me. - Do not start with me! All right, look, it's not bad. I can do without the bread, that's all right. You can put this butter on it. Please, just pour a glass of wine. Hear, hear. Morning, Mattie. Child, don't you know, before that paint dries, c.c. Baker be right back here with a can of spray paint, putting up them ol' nasty words right back up there. There's plenty more paint where this came from. Maybe I can wear him down. You can paint this 'ol wall every color of the rainbow it'll still be asphalt. Can't stand this ugly old thing. I don't even know why it's got to be here. Traffic control. I did some research. This neighborhood was originally supposed to be a major business district, but the traffic got too busy and the city decided to block off some of the auxiliary streets. There was this big battle about it in city hall because nobody wanted their block to become a dead-end street. Well, why didn't somebody fight for this street? I'm sure they did, but the streets with the most political clout won, which meant the rich people's streets stayed open and Brewster place got the wall. It's a shame. We could have been a main artery of this town. Ain't that the story. Colored folks try to do a little something, till somebody come along and throw up a wall. - Why don't you do something about it? - What I'm supposed to do? If I could tear down this wall with my bare hands, they'd just send somebody in the next day to put it up again. But at least you would have done something. Ain't no use. You young. You'll see what I mean. No, I won't. That's the difference between you and me. Did you remember my chocolate chip cookies? Well, hello. Hello to you, too. My day? My day was just fine, thanks. Little Baxter boy brought his puppy to the show-and-tell. Peed all over the floor, then proceeded to chew the heel off my shoe. But yes, I managed to hobble to the store to get you chocolate chip cookies. You know, you should have a talk with Mrs. Baxter. She ought to train that boy better than that. - Hello. - Hi. Well, I only had to work half a day and the only tragedy I had was that I lost a fingernail to the typewriter. I'll put the stuff away, and I'll make dinner so you can get some rest. No, you made dinner last night and fair is fair. I'm not even that tired. Tee? What? Have you noticed that people aren't as nice as they used to be? What people, Lorraine? You know, people in this building. They hardly speak to me anymore, and it wasn't like that when we first moved in. I don't know, it just, it makes me wonder, what are they thinking? I personally don't give a damn what they're thinking. Their "good evenings" don't put food on our table. Yeah, but you saw the way those two old ladies looked at US. They must know something or feel something. They, they, they! I'm not starting up with this again, Lorraine. Now, who in the hell are they? You know we're living in this dump of a building in this godforsaken neighborhood around a bunch of ignorant negroes with the cotton still underneath their fingernails because of you and your "theys." "They" knew something in linden hills, so I had to give up my beautiful apartment for you. Then "they knew" in park heights and you made me so miserable we had to move. Now these mysterious "theys" are on Brewster place? Look out the window, Lorraine. You see that wall? That's the end of the line for me. I'm not moving anymore, so if that's what you're working up to, save it! You see? That's why I didn't mention it to you. Because you're always flying off the handle and jumping to conclusions and I did not say a damn thing about moving. And I was not aware that you've been so miserable since we've been together. Look at this dried up celery and onions and stuff. These potatoes look like rocks. I know. I come down here to get my dinner, ain't none of this stuff fit to eat. Woman: Oh, you'll starve to death. Oh, boy, look at this big ol' onion. I'm scared to eat the thing. It's unnatural. Just like all them unnatural things I look at through my window. Oh, my lord. You got to be kidding. You mean right here in our own building? I wouldn't believe it myself if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. - Believe what? - What I told you. And then they pulled the shade down! So, what? I pull down my shades every night, too. Yeah, but you ain't ... That way. I'm sorry. Something new, I overreacted. I'm sorry. And you know good and well that if I was that miserable, I would have been gone a long time ago. You must think I'm some sort of paranoid freak. But, tee, I just can't afford to have people calling the school or writing to the principal. I know, I know. That's how I lost my job in Detroit, and teaching is my whole world, tee. I know, but look, it's not going to happen again. Lorraine, this school is too far away and you don't have to tell these old bitties where you work, you know. I mean, you're just worrying about nothing. But I know something that could make you feel a whole lot better about all of this. What? - Chocolate chip cookies. - Oh, lord, help me. Yes! Look, I just wanna know, when is somebody gonna do something about that crowd gathered under my window all night, every night, making all that racket? Woman: And yeah, what about all them kids be running up and down the hall all the time? Don't be talking about my kids, 'cause y'all got kids, too, and they ain't no saints neither. Why are you so touchy? Ain't nobody mentioned you. But if the shoe fits, steal it. Kiswana: Okay, look, this is getting US nowhere. What we should be discussing is staging a rent strike and taking the landlord to court. What we should be discussing is that bad element that's done moved into this block amongst decent people. I done called the police over a dozen times about c.C. Baker and that crowd gathered out in the alley, smokin' dope and robbing folks. Sophie: That ain't what I'm talking about and you know it. I'm talking about them two that just moved in across from me. Etta Mae: You know, Mattie, you know them two that mind their own business and never have a harsh word to say about nobody? Ain't them the two you mean? - What they're doing is wrong! - Woman: Oh, yeah, yeah. They're sinning against the lord. Well, let the lord take care of that. Kiswana: Okay, miss Sophie. Etta Mae, we really can't let this turn into a gossip session. That doesn't surprise me a bit, not coming from the likes of you. Etta Mae: What's that supposed to mean? You old prune pit! Kiswana: Excuse me, we must get back to business. Get on my nerves. Roscoe, you have a question? Theresa, won't you please go with me? To what, Lorraine? The tenants' meeting. I told you all about it. The tenants' meeting. Lorraine, they ought to condemn the place. That's a productive attitude. I'm sorry, I can think of better ways to waste my time. Why don't you go, and you can tell me all about it. Please? Okay. Don't forget to let me in, okay? 'Cause I don't have keys. I'll think about it. - Bye. - Bye. What do you mean, I owe three months' rent? I can't be no secretary. You talk about your mama not owing no rent! You understand me? You don't put my business in the street. I will kick your butt if you say I've suckered you. Do you understand me? You don't be putting my business in the street! Someone having a slight difference of opinion? Old Roscoe there claims betina shouldn't be secretary, 'cause she owes three months' rent. Ben: She say he owe more than that and it's none of his business. I don't know how it got into this. I thought we was supposed to be talking about ways to, uh, to raise money for a housing lawyer. Betina: Your mama! I'm gonna knock your cheating-- no, wait! - Hey, hey, hey! - Woman: Sister, put that down! Well, y'all can take y'all's tenants' meeting and stick it where the light don't shine! Woman: Well, then, leave, then! Kiswana: Okay, let's settle down. We still need somebody to take the minutes. Way this is going, they better take the hours. Um, excuse me. I'll take the minutes. Thank you. Okay, we can finally get down to business. Now, abshu's gonna tell US about some money-making ideas and then we'll take a vote. Ain't we supposed to vote over who we wants for secretary? I mean, can just anybody stroll in here and get shoved down our throats and we don't have nothing to say about it? Uh, look, I can just go. I was only trying to help. No, wait. What vote? No one wanted the job. Did you want to take notes? Lord, she can't do that, unless we all recite the abc's. And we better not do that too fast! Now, listen here. Why should a decent woman get insulted while y'all all takes sides with the likes of them. I'm as decent as you are, you old bat, and I'll come over there and land you on the mouth. Yes, I will, yes, I will! Now, sit down. Pick on me, pick on me! Like I'm the one going around doing all them filthy unnatural things! - Oh, please! - Every one of you's seeing it! Every one of you been done talking about it, not just me! You see what you done? Moving here with your nasty ways. Well, you ain't welcome here, you hear me? You ain't welcome here! What have any of you ever seen me do except leave my house and go to work just like the rest of you? Is it so disgusting for me to speak to all of you on the street even though nobody ever speaks back to me? Is that my crime? Don't you sit there like little miss innocent. I'll tell you exactly what I seen. I wasn't gonna mention such filthy things, but you done forced me. You forgot to close your shades last night. And I saw you. I saw the both of you. There you was, standing in the bathroom door, dripping wet and naked as you please. Calling to the other one to put down her book and come over and bring you a cool towel. She ain't got no-- standing in that bathroom door with your naked behind. I saw you! I saw you! I saw you! I saw you! I guess you step out of the tub with your clothes on to make it easier on Jessie's eyes! Kiswana: Okay, stop it. All right, be quiet. Everybody, shut up! There is nothing funny going on here. Why did you do that? This association is for everyone who lives here, you judgmental, self-righteous old wench! Who do you think you are? If you can't do anything but be disruptive and humiliate people then you can just get the hell out of my apartment. Man: That's right. Woman: Right! Fine. That's fine with me, sister! This ain't nothing but a whole bunch of old silly mess, anyway. Jessie! Go on, Jessie. I don't want to hear another word out of anyone that isn't strictly related to business. Do I make myself clear? Oh, god. Miss? Miss, you all right? You sure? Let me help you home. - Okay-- - I can't go home. Okay, you ain't got to. But I can't just let you stay out here alone. You might fall in with a bad element. Would you come over to my place and have a cup of tea? Well, I'm sorry about the mess. I-- I don't get that much company. Thank you. Mostly people mad because they ain't got no heat or their pipes beatin'. I hope it's okay. Mmm. Oh, it's just fine. Thank you. That's good, good. Lord knows how long I had them tea bags. I don't get that much company. Who's this in the picture? Oh, that, that's, uh-- that's maybelle Joyce, my little girl. You have a daughter? I used to. I mean, I ain't seen her in a long time. How about you, you got family around here? No. My parents kicked me out of the house when I was seventeen years old. They found a letter one of my girlfriends had written me. When I wouldn't lie about what it meant, they told me to get out. And not to take a thing they ever bought me. So, I left, with only the clothes on my back. I moved in with my cousin and I got a job at night at a bakery to put myself through college. I used to send them Christmas cards every year. They'd send them right back, unopened. After a while, I stopped putting a return address on them so they couldn't send them back. I guess they probably just threw them in the fireplace. Then, one year I called home. My mother answered the phone. Then, as soon as she heard it was me, she just-- she hung up. Thank you. You know, you-- you remind me lots of my little girl. Oh, she ain't a bit like you. It ain't always the way you look. She had a limp, on account of she was a breached baby. Oh. The midwife broke her foot when she was birthin' and it never came back right. So, she always kind of cripped along. But, she was a sweet child. So, when I seen you, the way you walk up the street, all timid-like, trying to be nice to these here folks, and the look on your face, when they'd be downright rude, and you'd look like you was kind of broke up in here, that's when I thought about my baby. So, I guess i-- I couldn't help it. I liked you from the first off. Thank you. And thank you for the tea. You're welcome, miss. Oh, anytime. Girl: Ouch! Are you all right? I hurt myself. Oh, you did? Can I see? - Oh. - It's bleeding. It sure is. Let's see. You think you can put a little bit of spit on this for me? Just a little bit? Right, that's good. See? - Will it hurt? - Of course not. You know what my grandmother used to say? That spit... Is god's iodine. See? There, I think you gonna live. I think it needs a bandage. Oh, you do? Okay. Let's see if we can find you one? What are you doing to her? Nothing. She hurt her knee. - Oh. - Mommy, I need a bandage. All right, baby, give me a minute. Uh-- I told her about these skates a million times. - You know how it is. - Yeah, I know. Bye-bye. What the-- you wanna see what I'm doing? Here, let me raise this so you can see better. I'm making meatloaf, you old bat! Meatloaf! The way normal people make it! Here! There's your chopped peppers! Onions. Onions! Oh, wait, I used eggs. Do you use eggs? Eggs. Eggs! Eggs! Here's something freaky for you. Olives! I put olives in my meat loaf! Run up and down the street and tell that! What are you yelling at, are you crazy? You're gonna have to take that up with my grandmother, because it's her recipe. But wait, I can't have you thinking I make meatloaf without meat! Whoa, whoa! Theresa! I don't care how mad you are, ground sirloin is $3 a pound! Oh. I told you I was tired of meatloaf. It's all right. It's all right, honey. I've heard it said that nature don't prepare US for the loss of a child. Seems to me there's a lot of things nature don't prepare US for. Yeah. It's like them two girls miss Sophie's about to fry her brains over. She ought to be glad they're that way. That's one less bed she got to worry about pulling Jess out of. You know, etta, I'd never say this in front of miss Sophie, 'cause I can't stand the way she love draggin' folks' business in the street, but if those girls are that way, I can't help it, it's just hard for me to feel like it's all right. I mean, how'd they get that way? You think it's from birth? Hell, Mattie, I don't know. I seen plenty of them, the places I been. They just say they love each other. I don't know. Well, I loved women, too. I love miss Eva, I love ciel, and even as ornery as you can get, I've loved you my whole life. Yeah, but it's different with them. They love each other the way you love a man. Or a man would love you. I've loved some women deeper than I ever loved any man. Some women loved me and treated me better than any man ever treated me. I know, but it's still different. I can't explain it, it just is. Well, maybe it ain't. Maybe that's why some women get so riled up about it, 'cause they know deep down inside it ain't no different at all. Kind of give you a funny feeling when you think about it like that, though. Yeah. I guess it does. Hi, Lorraine. Hi. I haven't seen you in a while. I've been kind of busy. Things have been really picking up, with the tenants' association, I mean. There's gonna be a block party tonight, so if you're not busy, we can use all the help we can get. Do you really think I'd wanna help after what happened at that meeting? I know. I'm really sorry about that, but I'm sure everybody's forgotten about it by now. I don't think so. Kiswana: Not everyone who lives here is miss Sophie. You can't judge them all by her. Hey, swana, better watch who you talk to. Brother abshu know about this? - I'll see you later. - No, wait. Don't let them bother you. They're nothing but a bunch of punks. C.c., why don't you take your little dusty behind and get out of here. Why? You got something planned you don't want me to watch? Hey, lesbo, come on over here and let me show you what a real man can do. From what I hear, c.C., she wouldn't even feel it. - You laughing at me, freak? - No, no, no. I ought to put my fist down your throat. You're gonna have to come through me first. Just try it. Come on, c.C., man, don't waste your time. She ain't nothing but a woman. I ain't gonna forget this, butch. Yeah, c.C., I won't sleep a wink. Man: Yeah, right. - Hi, honey. - Hi. You all right? You look a little pale. Oh, yeah. It's just the heat. I think I'm gonna take a couple aspirin and go lie down for a while. Good idea, then you'll be rested up for later. - What's later? - Sal called, and he and Byron are gonna give this birthday party down at the club and we're gonna go, so come on. Uhn-uh. I'm not going over there tonight. I hate that club. You never hated it before. I always hated it. The only reason I ever went was 'cause you wanted me to go. They make me sick with their prancing around. They're nothing but a couple of fags. So, what? We're nothing but a couple of dykes. You can call yourself anything you want to, tee, but you leave me out of it. Lorraine, you are a lesbian. A dyke, a lesbo, a butch, all those names that boy was calling you-- I saw him. And you can run to all the basements in the world and it's not gonna change anything. Why can't you just accept it? I have accepted it! I've accepted it all my life! I lost my family because of that! But it doesn't make me any different than anybody else in this world. It makes you damn different! No, it doesn't! You see this? There's only been two things that have been constant in my life, tee, since I was 16. That is beige bras and oatmeal. The day before I first fell in love with a woman, I got up in the morning, I had oatmeal for breakfast I put on my beige bra and I went to school. The day after I fell in love with that woman, I got up in the morning, I had oatmeal for breakfast, put on my beige bra, and I went to school. I wasn't any different before that happened or after that happened, tee. And what did you do the next day when you went to school? Did you stand around in the locker room and swap stories about this new love in your life with the other girls? Huh? Why-- why didn't you stand up there in that locker room and pass her picture around? Huh? Why didn't you take her to the senior prom? Why not, hm? Lorraine, answer me. Because they wouldn't have understood! That's right! And as long as they own the whole damn world, it's them and US, and that spells different. And if you're gonna be too damn puny to live with that, then there's no hope for you. There's no hope for US. Oh, Mattie, I see some clouds over there. I hope they don't come this way. Child, the lord done give US a nice day for this party, leave it alone about them few clouds. Oh, I feel good today, too. Whew! I feel pretty good myself. How long do folks who ain't welcome here have to put up with all this noise? Miss Sophie, ain't nobody said you ain't welcome here. Here, go find me some ice. I can't sell them sodas if they get hot. Woman, you talk like you've been hit by a train. Why I'm going to work at a party where I ain't even welcome? Oh, hush your fussin'. You know you about to have two fits to be at this party. Go on and get me some ice. Give it over here. She'll be the last one they drag out of here. You Mark my word. - Miss Johnson, wanna dance? - Oh, I don't mind if I do. Woman, you better stay here and act your age. Ooh, i'm acting it-- 35. You got regrets older than that!

Ben, we need to make ourselves two killings 'cause them housing lawyers don't come cheap. - Anything I can do to help? - As a matter of fact, you can go back there by that wall and drag me a box round here so I can put this trash in it. It's on to me. Hello? Hey, what's going on back there? Child? What's done happened to you? Oh, it's okay, I ain't gonna hurt you. - Get away from me! - Let me help you. - Get-- get away from me! - It's okay. - I ain't gonna hurt you! - Leave me alone! - Come on, honey, let me help you. - Leave me alone! Ah! Etta Mae: Whoo! Come on, Mattie. Come on. Mattie, it's gonna rain. We've gotta get everything inside. Oh it's just spittin' a little, child. Ain't gonna amount to much. Lord, where did Ben go with that trash box? I'll go get it myself. Here, try one of these ribs. Mattie! Etta Mae, it really is gonna rain. Oh, hush, child.

Honey, put that stick-- get away! Get away! Get away! Man: Did somebody call the police? What the-- woman: Lord have mercy. Look at him! Man: Ben! - Woman: Did you see him? - Woman #2: I wonder who did it to him. - Woman: I can't believe it! - Man: I'm the one that helped them. What's going on? What's happening? Somebody's hurt. Well, I can figure that out. She done beat poor Ben upside the head. Who? Your friend. Honey, you better get on up there. Go on, see what happened. Tee: Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me! Lorraine? Lorraine? - Tee! - What happened? What happened? Just tell me, baby. Shh, shh, shh. Baby, I'm here. - What happened? Be careful! - Tee! I'm here, baby, what happened? Where are you taking her? - Wait, wait, wait-- - let her in! Let her in! Let her in! What is it? What-- Man: They didn't bother nobody. Man: They didn't bother nobody! I don't know what happened! Mattie: That's why I don't trust trying no more. The harder folks try the more something come along smack 'em down. There's always something! Standing in the way of good. Blocking it out, just like that wall, blocking up this street. And I'm tired of it! Y'all hear me? I'm tired of it and I can't stand it no more. Etta Mae: Mattie, where you goin'? Man: Well, I hope he's gonna be all right. Woman: What is she doing? Mattie: Y'all gonna stand there? Or y'all gonna help? Woman: Come on, we can't just stand here and watch! Oh, no! They're gonna put every one of our butts in jail! Well, I guess we'll just have to tear that down, too.
