Want some water? It's 11 o'clock already. You're a pain, Sandrine. I called you. That's nice. You can take a shower if you want. - I'll have to fix that. - Now you're an electrician too? You're a pain, Sandrine. Just kidding. That's what you like about me. Erwan? Yeah? Never mind. What do you mean? Yesterday he loved it! He was practically euphoric! - It's me. - I'll call you back. Hello, it's Sandrine from Agence D. I'm told you have a problem. Actually, so have I... They shouted like it was the end of the world. Yes, he told me, "I'll be there at half-past." Sorry, I had a call. Yeah. I have important news. Jean-Michel's left Mum. He finally grew some balls after 20 years! She's moving to Paris. She wants me to find her an apartment. I'll call you back. MUM See you Wednesday. - Hi, Sandrine. - Hi. You OK? Want a tea or a coffee? Something to nibble on? - Erwan! - Yeah? Client meeting. - All right, Mum? - Fine. We visited four. I chose a nice 2-room place. I have to get it sorted, she's coming soon. No kidding! Don't say that. What do you want me to say? You've always been like that. What do you mean, like that? When is "soon"? In two days. Don't count on me. I'm keeping out of it. - Mum? - Yes? Here I am. It's... It's incredible. You haven't changed. You look great. Nor have you. - You OK? - Not great. I've felt better. - Was it a long journey? - The usual. Barely 3 hours. I pleased to see you, you know? Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I've got everything ready for you. When I think of all I've done for him. The bastard! You'll like it here. - It's thanks to Serge. - What? Who's that? Serge. My husband. He works in property. I thought it was the lightest place. It's a nice neighbourhood, lots of shops. If you want to visit me, there's a direct line. Some little tart got her claws into him! One his own age. Where do you want to start? I remembered your table service. You and Dad argued over it when you divorced. We could start with the bedroom. - I couldn't find your bed linen. - Get me out of here. Get me out of here! You play piano? Not really. I have two students. Five and seven. You give lessons? Just on Wednesdays. It's something to do. I guess you don't need to work. I'll show you how to play if you want. Where's the toilet? Down the hall. Which one? Go through my room. - This way? - Through there. Quite a maze you've got here. How's your sister? She's fine. Fine. She couldn't make it. She's got a lot of work at the moment. No point leaving messages. She never calls back. That's him. That's Serge. We've been together eight years. For me it was 20. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. - I don't feel well. - Sit down. Want a glass of water? I think I'll lie down. Don't worry. We'll see each other often. You can stay for dinner if you like. Then we'll take you home. - It's a miracle. - What? That you happened to be passing. She says you never return her calls. She never took care of us. Why should we take care of her? - What do I tell her? - That I'm working. I did. She still asks about you. - I spend all my time with her. - Give me a break! - Got a table? - For two? This way. Nobody's forcing you to see her. The last one, just for you. - Wild rabbit today. - Rabbit it is. Save me a crème brulée. No, don't. Yes, do. And you? No. Forget it. This is a great place. Not many left round here. All their stuff is fresh. Alice. My sister. Erwan. Head of finance at the agency. Erwan de Kerdoec. Delighted to meet you. I didn't know you had a sister. Here's your rabbit. Thanks. You like hunting? It's a tradition in Brittany... - Erwan! - Yes? Woah! One o'clock already. Better get back to the office. I guess - you won't call me? - That's right. Bon appétit. Miss. - You never tell me anything. - Nothing to tell. He seems nice. You think everyone's nice. No, I don't. Yes, you do. Even you-know-who. Don't call her that. What should I call her? A mother? She's seen Serge. He installed her TV. Well, well. Suddenly it's useful to have daughters. It's hard for her. Yes? Yes, yes. I'm with Serge. OK, I'll pick you up. What does she look like? Same as before. A bit fatter. OK. Just to see that, then. Sunday? I'm really busy Sundays. Next Sunday, I'll have the kids. She hasn't seen me in 20 years. She can wait another week. It's me. You're hard to reach. I wonder why you have a mobile. Oh, well. Your sister said you're coming Sunday. Next Sunday, obviously. Well... I don't know what to say. So I'll say goodbye. And thanks again for your support. Shit, my jacket! Yesterday - you were glad to be pregnant. - It's a pain. You can't say that. I... I can't let you talk like that. I know, but just at the moment it's... Not the right time. And what was it last time? You're not your mother. - You like Bordeaux, Mrs... - Call me Mine. Great view. It's noisy. It's true what they say, noise rises. I've got some nibbles, if you like. Do you mind? Stay there. I'll go. He's charming, discreet, helpful and with a good job. A rare pearl, and you do nothing. - Sure she's coming? - She said so. Three weeks I've been in Paris. I'm amazed she's doing me the honour. Mind the cat doesn't get out! What do you know? That it'll be funny to have a new grandmother. - What do we call her? - Granny, if you want to annoy her. - Paulette, then? - No, not that. Call her Mine. - What floor? - Seventh. - What do you call her? - I don't call her. Hello. Hello. My children, Thomas, 16, and Nicolas, - nearly 14. - Hello, Granny. Not Granny. - Hello, Paulette. - Not Paulette. Call me Mine. I'm fine, thanks. Me too. Here. Close the door. All right? Sit down. You can see the Eiffel Tower. Got anything for them? I'll go. - We said 1 o'clock, it's 1.15. - We didn't say. Thank you. - Want some? - What is it? One of mine. Don't tell me. - Saint-Julien? - Bingo. Nice necklace. And useful for moving house. - You're Thomas? - No, I am. Easy mistake. Last time you saw him, he wasn't born. Geographical separation was never good for family relations. What's happening with you? Have you been out of town? - I'm snowed under. - Really? Work, kids, I'm really busy. Making up ads must take up a lot of time. Commercials. We always called them ads. It's the same crap you see on TV in any case. How are things with you? Up and down. I need a dentist. Trouble with my bridge. There's one downstairs, but I don't like the look of him. What else? I just told you, I have toothache. It's like your messages, you never listen! Can't you be pleased to see me? What would please me is that you arrive on time, three weeks ago! Sorry, I can't do this. We're leaving. You always leave on time! Snowed under! No petrol to meet me at the station? Was your arm in plaster the day I moved house? I've been here three weeks! What do you think? She's got problems. And I don't? Has she been abandoned? She's a pain. - It's hot! - It's just come out of the oven! Can't you do anything? I've had enough. Hey, let's go! I've had it. I'm not ready. Alice, I've had enough of understanding. It's me. It's me who wanted to. I've thought it over. The whole week. Give me a minute. I'm not ready. Right. Fancy just turning up like that! Lunch! Come on. Let it go. Have you seen my bag? Here it is. Shall I turn the TV off? Were you hoping I'd call you? Let's drop it. - How many did you put in? - Seven. - Look where you're going! - Don't tell me how to drive. Did you fill up? I know, I should have thought of it. She weighs a ton! She'd never have done this for us. - Sure he won't turn up? - Don't worry about it. - Where are you going? - To get some glasses. How many times have you been here? They must have some impressive dinners here. You're drinking too much. Less than you're smoking. - What time is it? - Midnight. Then it's already tomorrow. You'll see, there's a nice view by day. Are you sorry? - I love the sea. - Huh? I said I love the sea. You scared me. Anyone there? Where am I? Anyone there? Answer me! LOOK AT US - We look really weird. - Never mind. I feel like I'm talking to myself. - You start. - It was your idea. - We agreed. - Please, show me how it's done. Does it bother you not knowing us? Have you finished clowning around? I know you're there! Do you hear me? Open this door right now! Open up! What are you trying to do? Upset me? Open it, dammit! Do you hear me? I'm glad I had boys. At least they're OK. I'm lucky. I know nothing of love. Tenderness, contact... Presence. Warmth. You never looked at me affectionately. Never kissed me. I never smelt your perfume. No smell. I never had any affection. Only chastisement. For years, I thought people who loved each other were ridiculous. It didn't bother me at first. It was part of my personality. A way of saying, "I'm hard, proud, strong, I don't need anyone." I fought so hard to prove to myself I didn't need your love, I became hard. I don't know how to love. I don't know what to do. You never taught me. I'm... handicapped. - Was that OK? - Yes, it was good. There are things I don't know how to say. If I wasn't drunk, I couldn't tell you this. I've tried everything to make you love me. I look at you, but I can see you're not interested. I don't interest you. Did you ever wonder why I have no kids? You never asked me why. As if... As if it was normal, as if you didn't allow it. As if you were proving me right. Why don't I have kids? Maybe to please you. Does it please you? Or maybe because I'm sterile. Tell me, Mum, am I sterile? I've had abortions. - Tell her how many. - No. Go on, tell her. I'll tell you. Several times. I even lied to Serge, and that's not all, because... I think he would already have... But... Don't cry. Don't cry. I'm not crying. See? I'm doing your job. Well, well, what a surprise! Where are we? - A friend of Sandrine's place. - A mate. Nice, isn't it? Other than that? - Would you like some tea? - No, thanks, not for me. I'm sorry, but unfortunately I must decline your invitation. You packed, then brought me here like this! How could you? We had no choice. We can't talk to you. You don't want to listen. You're not there, and when you are... Your sister led you on again! You're off your heads! We say we're unhappy, you say we're mad! Don't you think it took courage to do this? It's humiliating. What do you hope to achieve? To talk. I've nothing to talk about. Talk? You want to settle scores? Not at all. We want you to love us. Did you expect me to hug you? - What are you doing? - I won't let that nut destroy us. People like you are a menace. They need to be neutralised. What's this? A joke? Yeah, it's a joke. Get back in the house. Move! Go on! Go on. Go on! Sit your fat ass down there. There! Go on. We'll have a nice family day and you'll cheer us up. Come on, sing. Sing! Sing for us! Enjoy looking after your children. A pretty tune That my mum sang to me While I sucked my thumb I listened as I fell asleep The little doe is baying The wolf is hiding in the woods But the brave knight came And took the doe in his arms Arms, arms, arms, sing! The doe in his arms... She doesn't even know the goddam song! Be very careful what you say, because that's all over now. The insults, the humiliation. Do you hear? Encouraging your kids, valuing them, complimenting them. You know? Go on. Say something nice. Go on. Try. Be inventive. You know what nice means. Improvise. Use your imagination. You're out of practice. We're starting from scratch. We're not asking for much. Would it tear out your throat to pay us a compliment? Say something! Can't you see it has to change? I won't bother you any longer. I'm going. Back to live in Lyon. Keep her covered. A ten-metre chain. Gives you a little slack. You poor girls. I have nothing to say! I won't say anything! You don't know me! Take your time. We're in no hurry. Why don't you love us? Was I asleep long? Less than three hours. Wasn't it a bit... I've got enough doubts as it is. Don't add to them. Hungry? Want something to eat? I think I saw some soup. Here. Wine? I feel sick. I'm pregnant and you feel sick! I'm so scared of being like you. It's always the mother's fault. - The father... - You've done enough harm to Dad. On top of everything else. Forgive me for daring to divorce him. Nowadays you get to try several, as you know. But I married the first one to escape my mother. No-one blames you for getting divorced. I struggled, I worked, you wanted for nothing! A roof over our heads, clothes on our backs and food on the table. I'm 60 and too old for lectures. I'm 40 and I can say what I think of you. It's you! You hate me! You've always been ashamed of me! How am I meant to feel? As a kid, when I tried to kiss you, you acted disgusted. You can't say that, Mum. What do you know? Were you there? Always taking her side. That's enough! Stop talking to her like that! No more! Look at yourself! Never happy. Never satisfied. Never a kind word. The nights I spent wondering, "Why didn't my daughters love me?" - You're raving, Paulette. - Don't call me that. What do you want me to call you? You didn't love me. You never have. A bad mother? Bad daughters more like! The banes of my life! We haven't bothered you for 20 years. You both left me. We left because we were better off alone than at home with you! Did you look for us? Was I meant to arrange my life around you two? Ah, that! You took care of your ass, with your Jean-Michel. Yes, I chose to look after my ass. Your mother has an ass! I had the best 20 years of my life! If I'd had to rely on you... And motherly love? What about that? Motherly love? I never had the instinct. I never felt anything. Only regrets. Repeat that. Just repeat it. Only regrets! Get out. You still here? I don't know what to do. Help me. It's about time. I'd like to have been different. But I couldn't help it. It's not your fault either. If it's too late, I'll be very sad. I can be sad. She didn't know how. It's not entirely her fault. No-one taught her. No-one taught me, either. Maybe you're stronger than her. Or maybe it's just luck. I've spent my life being afraid... of trying... You've always been like that. Like what? What do you mean? The mother wails and the daughter responds. And you... Do you know you're aggressive? What were you hoping for? What did you expect? She's taken a step. Isn't that why we came? A step? I don't say she'll be the mother we've always dreamed of. I'd never say a thing like that. But you have to make an effort too, or there was no point! Accept Mum as she is, with her faults. She's not the only one who has them! You... You never give anything to anyone. You know what? I understand why your men leave you. Only your kids and your cat are worthy in your eyes. And you know a lot about kids, don't you? So superior, so above everything, so unique! Fuck you! I can understand that you never helped us. Never looked at us, supported us, you didn't know how, that you were incapable. I can even understand that. But you weren't afraid for us. You weren't worried for a second. It didn't stop you from living. From sleeping. You never missed me. I can't swallow that. 20 years. My God! 20 years! If one of my kids disappeared, I couldn't breathe. Let's take a ride. I could keep you company if you like. No, thanks. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't realise. I'm sorry. You have a mother, even if you don't like her. Wait. Mum? RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
