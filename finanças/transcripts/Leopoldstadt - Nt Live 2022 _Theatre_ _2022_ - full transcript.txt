(MELANCHOLIC MUSIC STARTS UP) (MUSIC BUILDS) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) (MUSIC RECEDES) ["SILENT NIGHT" ON PIANO] – CHILD 1: That's mine! – CHILD 2: She took my silver bell, Jana! CHILD 1: The snowflakes have to go on last. CHILD 2: This one's broken! Oh, look, the little trumpet works, toot-toot! Who's this, Emilia? Hermann's father when we were engaged. – Imbecile! – Like a daisy chain, two by two. "Hello" - drops her drawers - "Bye-bye. Next!" "Hello" - drops her drawers - "Bye-bye. Next!" – Eva! – Changing partners, like a round dance! Interpreting dreams, you will recall, got Joseph out of prison in Egypt and into a top job with the Pharaoh. But the Viennese medical fraternity is more conservative, even though half of them would still be in the land of Canaan. – Can I have mine, Grannie Emilia? – You can when you finish the tree, Sally. We only have a tree for you little Papists. Ernst is Protestant, Emilia. Protestant or Papist, it's still a nice Jewish boy with ideas about himself. You can hit a dozen like him throwing chestnuts across the Danube Canal. Well, can I be after you with it? You're not allowed to eat the decorations, Rosa! – I saw you, Missy! – I only licked it! – [JANA LAUGHS] – I've got the star for the top, Mummy! – Jacob, shall we put it on the tree? – Nonsense! Hysteria, neurosis - the more modern the diagnosis, the more the treatment returns to its origins in the priesthood. So, yes, the interpretation of dreams, why not? But he has no connections and no followers. He should have been extraordinarius by now. He should go to Argentina. – He'd be a professor in no time. – Why Argentina? Or Africa. Palestine is a lost cause so long as it's ruled by the Ottomans. Oh! Or Madagascar! They say there's plenty of room for a Jewish state in Madagascar! Madagascar with Jews - it sounds a bit like a dream in itself. A pipedream. Inscribed to Ludwig... Arthur couldn't get his play published, let alone put on, so he had a few copies printed for his friends. Ask Hermann. – Look, Mummy! – That's lovely, darling. Hermann's in a temper about having his own country somewhere. I'll leave it here for you. You're not looking! (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) – Is that right? – Oy... It's a beautiful star, darling, but it's not the star we put at the top of our Christmas tree. I'll find it. I know which one it is. – What's wrong with it? – Poor boy! Baptised and circumcised in the same week. – What can you expect? – It's true. He cried both times. – I don't understand my brother. – He's just a man. He doesn't want his son to be different from him. – What are you talking about? – Foreskins! – Hanna, can't you play something else? – Ask Daddy. With my Pauli, it's simple. We're Jews! Bad Jews, but pure-blood sons of Abraham, and Ludwig's parents wouldn't have anything to do with us if their grandson didn't look Jewish in his bath. In fact, if I'd had myself Christianised like Hermann, Ludwig wouldn't have married me. Would you? Be honest. – I would when they were dead. – Is that a compliment? Honour thy father and thy mother. [SHE GASPS] I didn't mean that the way it sounded. And Ernst. Of course. Mathematics is the only language in which you can make yourself clear, I find. Wilma, you really ought to come to Momma and Poppa's for Seder this year, with Ernst and the girls, naturally. I should. It might be her last year. You and Gretl too, of course. It would be nice for the cousins to do Seder together. I'll come. What happens at Seder? You seem to think becoming a Catholic is like joining the Jockey Club. It's not unlike, except that anyone can become a Catholic. (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) You're snobby about Granny and Grandpa Jakobovicz, Hermann, if I may say so. – I? – Yes, you! You're snobby about their accents and using Yiddish words, and dressing like immigrants from some village in Galicia, except they're still there, keeping the village shop! There's too much of the shtetl about them for you. That's not being snobby, it's being... snobby, yes, I admit it. I'd like to see Galicia, Hermann. – It would be interesting. – How can it be interesting? For that matter, everyone can come to us, can't they? Ludwig! It'll be the baby's first Seder. Oh, yes please, Eva! – What about Momma and Poppa? – Them too. Vienna will be exciting for them. – It's only changing trains. – Changing what train? It takes half a day to get to the train! And she'll want to bring her bedding, not to mention enough food to open a restaurant. She'll spend three weeks getting ready, getting more nervous every day, worrying about leaving the shop... In fact, with her heart, it will probably kill her. – There's nothing wrong with her heart. – Who are you to say that? Who is Dr Lissak to say that, do you mean? Just like a son! Momma and Poppa denied themselves everything, so they could be proud of you getting into the university! I was agreeing with you! What about me? When is anybody going to be proud of me getting out into anywhere? It's all very well for you, Wilma. You never gave Momma a thought when you snapped up Ernst, regardless of whether he was a Jew or an Eskimo! I want to come to Vienna for Passover! And so you shall, won't she, Hermann? – When's Passover? – How do I know? March, April... But anyway, we're likely to be in the Italian Lakes again next year... No! Stop interfering! We're going to Momma and Poppa's. It might be her last chance to show she's forgiven me for marrying Ernst. If she hasn't, you can bring the girls to me, Wilma. Unless it's the same time as Easter. I don't mind Christmas because Baby Jesus had no idea what was going on. (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) But I feel funny about Easter eggs. – You seem to have been struck dumb. – Who wouldn't be? I have to go anyway, I've got a sitting. What's a sitting? Can I come? No, darling, I can't be changing my expression whilst you're fidgeting. Everyone to the tree! Gretl, can I tell you something? – I've met someone. – Oh, Hanna! Tell me at once. He's an officer in the Dragoons, and he likes me. Of course he does! Where were you introduced? – We weren't exactly. – How did you meet him? – He just spoke to me in the street. – Oh. He and his friend. They were very polite. They saw me getting off the tram at the corner of the opera. – And then what? – They said, can they have the honour of taking me to tea at the Imperial. [LAUGHS] They were so amusing. – Then the other one had to leave. – The other one? Yes, Theodore. Fritz, the one I liked, asked me to dance. Oh, Gretl, you should have seen me. Whirled around in the arms of a dashing officer until I could have fainted. Fräulein Hanna Jakobovicz in society! Then I had to go. Fritz asked if he could walk me home. And I said, "Well, you'll have to walk me to Galicia, "but I'm sure Mummy and Daddy will ask you in." [LAUGHS] No, I know, I could die when I think of me gabbling non-stop and telling silly jokes. He said he'd walk me to my sister's this time, but that we should have tea again before I go home, and he invited me to tea at his place tomorrow. Goodness! Did you say yes? No, no! I said no, the very idea! I don't want Fritz thinking I'm that kind of girl. So I said... not unless I could bring a friend. – So, will you? – Me? Well, I haven't got any friends in Vienna, and you're like a friend. – Oh, Hanna, I... – Oh, please will you? Or I won't go. Well... [SIGHS] Why not. Of course I will. [BELL JINGLES] Music, please! And lights! [PIANO PLAYS] [ALL APPLAUD] That is magnificent! Now you can have cake. – [CHILDREN CLAMOUR] – Ludwig. There's something about a theory being published at the very beginning of a new century. Like an augury. Like the curtain going up on something. New centuries just depend on when you start counting. But I don't doubt that dreams can tell us something about ourselves. I sometimes dream I've proved the Riemann Hypothesis. In fact, Eva, would you like to go to Paris this summer for the Exposition? – I'll come! – Paris? What's going on? I can't get you to come to Ischl for a few days in the country, and now... – Of course you must. – Vienna will be there in force. Mahler is taking the Philharmonic to the Paris Exposition. There you are. He's taking his Second Symphony to annoy the French. We went to the premiere of the Second Symphony, Ludwig, and you didn't like it. That's not the point. He's our man! Another Christian still wet from his baptism. And we're sending the "Philosophy" painting from the university to show the Parisians. I was asked to sign a petition got up against it by the Philosophy Faculty. Did you hear that, Hermann? My painter is being exhibited at the World Fair in Paris! The faculty want Plato and Aristotle discussing ideas in an olive grove, they don't want modern art stuck up on the ceiling of the university calling itself "Philosophy". We could have a look at it in Paris. Ludwig, you couldn't be bothered to cross the road... [IRRITATED] I would have done if I wasn't so busy, but at the World Exposition the honour of Vienna is at stake - in art, in music, and to give Paris its due, you might buy one or two dresses, say two at the most. – Eva, you have to go. – And what will you be doing? As it happens, the Second International Conference of Mathematicians is to be held in Paris during the Exposition, so I... [STUTTERS] Well, if you're going with or without me, I'm coming. Oh, Hermann, I want to go to the mathematical conference! Will Riemann be there? Riemann is dead. What about his wife? No, that was in bad taste. I'm late. Poldi, I have to take my green shawl. – Oh, I need some cake at once, please! – I'll get it, Mummy. Thank you, Poldi. Now... Look at you! He should be paying me. No, no... Then how would I know my portrait is because you love me? – It is. – Kiss me then. – On the mouth, nobody's looking. – Yes, they are. Thank you, Pauli. The children are going to get some fresh air and see the camels in Stephansplatz. – Oh, make sure Pauli has his gloves. – Camels? The Nativity scene. Who wants to lick the spoon? [ALL CLAMOUR] Me, me! The first one to say, "You have it, Grandma," would have got the cream, but no one said it, so... [ALL] Oh! (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) Thank you, Hanna. All hands on deck. Coats on, coats on! – Jacob, have you told Uncle Ludwig? – Told me what? Come, Jacob... tell your uncle. I was first in my class for mathematics. First in his class for mathematics! My word! Well done! – His teacher says he's a natural. – I congratulate you, Jacob. You have great pleasures in store. Numbers are a huge toy box. We can play with them and make amazing, beautiful things. Ask him something. What are you hoping to get for Christmas? I mean, test him! You'll see. Oh, well... do you think you can add together all the numbers between one and ten in your head? Oh, that's too easy. Go on, Jacob. – [CHILDREN YELLING] – Not so much noise! Are you going with them, Ernst? No, I've got to show up at the neurology department. Did you have to have a patient today? No. You didn't do this last year. I wasn't extraordinarius last year. It's just one drink with the lecturers and a "Merry Christmas" to the assistants, it's expected. – Fifty-five! – Quite right. And fifty-five is five elevens. – That's interesting. – Come on, Jacob! About average. What do you mean? Wasn't he right? He answered correctly, but he failed the test. Carl Friedrich Gauss, when he was seven years old, was asked to add together all the numbers between one and a hundred. With barely a pause he answered, "Five thousand and fifty." Now that's a natural. But... was it the right answer? Would I be telling you this story if it was not the right answer? A Jew might have made a guess, because there'd be a good chance the other person didn't know either. [LAUGHS HESITANTLY] But why a Jew? Oh, don't you start. – Is your son a natural? – Pauli? No! He's obsessed with model soldiers. Ah. Can't wait to be in uniform. Well, what's the trick? The trick is that you can add together the numbers in any order you like, one plus ten, two plus nine, three plus eight, so that each pair adds up to the same sum. For Jacob, five pairs of eleven. Hm. He'd be better off being good at something useful. Something practical in the circumstances. I don't mean mathematics isn't useful, of course. Of course. Although number theory isn't, as far as we know. No doubt Eva has told you that Gretl can't have any more children, so all my money is on Jacob. An unfortunate expression, you're thinking. Not at all. Admirably to the point. Best of all, I would have liked my son to be a great composer. A virtuoso of the piano would be almost as good. But alas! So Jacob will take over Merz & Co from his father and grandfather, as is the nature of things, and I'll have done my duty to the business. I've been writing in names that are missing... The ones I know, which is by no means all of them. That's what happens, you see. First, there's no need to write who they are, because everyone knows that's Great-Aunt Sophia or Cousin Rudi. And then only some of us know. And already we're asking, "Who's that with Gertrude?" and "I don't remember this man with the little dog," and you don't realise how fast they're disappearing from being remembered. It's still an amazing thing to me, to know the faces of the dead. I can still remember Grandpa Jakobovicz's tobacco-stained whiskers, but his wife died giving birth to Poppa before there were photographs. So now no one knows what she looked like any more than if she were some kind of rumour. Everyone was mad to have a photograph when I was a girl. It was like a miracle. And you had to go to a photographer to pose for him. Wedding couples, soldiers in their first uniforms, children in front of painted scenery. Later, when we had a camera, there were holiday pictures with real scenery - swimming pictures, pictures of the children in dirndl pinafores and lederhosen, – like little Austrians. [CHUCKLES] – I remember. Here's a couple waving goodbye from a train. But who are they? No idea. That's why they're waving goodbye. It's like a second death to lose your name in a family album. What do you think of the whisky? A gift from a supplier, best wool in Scotland, straight from the sheep. I happen to know our Emperor had it made up into a hunting jacket. Oh! Did you say you have no use? In the sense that a composer has no use compared to a textile manufacturer, yes. But pure mathematics is as absorbing as music. It's like finding the music in the untuned totality of number. – And do you get paid for that? – Yes. I have no idea why. But if I fell asleep for a hundred years, the first thing I'd ask when I woke is, "Has Riemann been proved?" – Why? – Because if it has, I can state with certainty how many prime numbers exist below a given number however high, and if it hasn't, I can't, not with certainty. [CHUCKLES] That is a very annoying answer. Yes, but it has the saving grace that a number theorist, however great, is innocent of usefulness. Unlike the applied mathematician, who is the handmaiden of ballistics, modern architecture... Are you great? No. But I have a student who might be, which is not nothing. Is he a Jew? – No. – He'll be a Professor before you are. – I hope so. – Oh, don't exaggerate! Why do Jews have to choose between pushy and humble? You're probably in line for the next Jew-slot, so don't fall for this Judenstaat idiocy. Do you want to do mathematics in the desert or in the city where Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven overlapped, and Brahms used to come to our house? We're Austrians. Viennese. Doctors come from all over the world to study here. Philosophers. Architects. A city of art lovers and intellectuals like no other. Yes, and don't forget the cafes, the cakes... Oh, ha-ha. The seat of 600 years of accumulating Poles, Czechs, Magyars, Romanians, Ruthenians, Italians, Slovaks, Croats and God knows what else, from the Swiss frontier to the Russian Empire. Parliaments and parties in I don't know how many languages. Stitched together by the same black-and-yellow livery of post-boxes from Salzburg to Czernowitz and fealty to the Emperor-King Franz Joseph, who emancipated his Jews in time for us to grow up with the same rights as everyone else. Obviously, prejudice doesn't disappear overnight. The civil service, the army, the university... No, that must be why the police stand and watch Jewish students get thrown down the university ramp, before arresting them for causing a disturbance. Yes, that is why! But fifty years ago, you couldn't get a foot in. You couldn't travel without a permit, or get a bed for the night in village or town except in the Jewish quarter, and if you lived in Vienna, you lived in Leopoldstadt. You wore a yellow patch, and stepped off the pavement to make way for an Austrian. By all that's holy, it happened in one lifetime. My grandfather wore a kaftan! My father went to the opera in a top hat, and I have the singers to dinner! Actors, writers, musicians. We buy the books, we look at the paintings, we go to the theatres, the restaurants, we employ music teachers for our children. A new writer, if he's a great poet like Hofmannsthal, walks among us like a demi-god. We literally worship culture. When we make money, that is what the money is for, to put us at the beating heart of Viennese culture. This is the Promised Land. And not because it's some place on a map where my ancestors came from. We're only one in ten, but without us, Austria would be the Patagonia of banking, science, the law, the arts, literature, journalism... The Neue Freie Presse, owned, edited and written by Jews, declined to notice its own literary editor's book, which you can have back now, thanks, because Herzl is a man with a beehive in his bonnet. A fantasy of the Jews of Europe and America uprooting themselves for a utopia among goatherds, which wouldn't even have a common language! – Not Hebrew? – Hebrew? You couldn't even buy a tram ticket in Hebrew! Trams in the desert? That's a good idea. In fact, it's not a Jewish home for the Jews that Theodor Herzl has in mind, it's a liberal state where Jews can play cricket and tennis! – Really? Cricket? – But who would want to go live there? Not many of us in Austrian bourgeois high society, I grant you. But everybody who wants to be, can be! We're the torchbearers of assimilation! Your boy Pauli will wear the shako and fur-trimmed cape of an officer in the Hussars. What's the matter with you that you can't see what's happening? [LAUGHS] But it's you who's missed it, Hermann. The only welcome Theodor Herzl's little book received was in the anti-Semitic press. A state for Jews? Good idea! Get them out of here! Naturally, the Jewish press was offended. Written by middle-class Jews in the culture capital of Europe. They have enough trouble without Zionism making a song and dance about being different when sameness is the goal. But when Eva and I visited my family, everywhere we went I was asked about Herzl. This book was going around like a fever. These are people whose parents arrived with their parents, running for their lives from the Cossacks, and, mentally, they're living with their bags packed. In Galicia, the Jews are hated by the Poles, in Bohemia by the Germans, in Moravia by the Czechs. A Jew can be a great composer. He can be the toast of the town. But he can't not be a Jew! In the end, if it doesn't catch up on him, it will catch up on his children. Ordinary Jews understand this. The Empire is made up of so many peoples you couldn't remember them all, but you left out the Jews, the only people without a territory. So when someone comes along and says, "We lost our territory, but we can have it again, "a country where we're not on sufferance, "where we can be what we once were, – "where we can be warriors..." – They can have a territory. That's what assimilation means. I have to admire your patience on behalf of ordinary Jews. Meanwhile, the Christian Social Party has got in on the anti-Semitic vote. Our popular mayor is the orator of anti-Semitism. We grew up in a liberalising time, under a liberal government who sincerely believed they represented millions, when hardly any had a vote. Parliament was a gentlemen's debating chamber. But politics is no longer a gentlemen's game, so to hell with it! We worship culture, but, Hermann... assimilation doesn't mean to stop being a Jew. Your incidental effect would be the end of Judaism. Assimilation means to carry on being a Jew without insult. Episcopalians are assimilated. Zoroastrians are assimilated. I could be a Druid for all my professors care. It's only the Jews! I'm an unbeliever. I don't observe Jewish customs, except as a souvenir of family ties. But to a gentile, I'm a Jew. There isn't a gentile anywhere who at one moment or another hasn't thought "Jew!" You can be baptised, you can marry a Catholic... [STOPS SUDDENLY] I didn't mean that the way it sounded. [STUTTERS] I didn't mean you. Of course, I mean, I did, but... Sorry. On one whisky! I'd better have another. Are you really a member of the Jockey Club? Willi von Baer is putting me up. Ah. I see. The first Christian of Jewish descent. Ah! Progress. – So, what is your point? – About what? – About anything. – Oh, it's gone. – What about you? – Mine? Mine is that the 20th century is upon us. And centuries don't come round again like the seasons. We wept by the waters of Babylon, but that's gone. And everything after - expulsions, massacres, burnings, blood libels - gone like the Middle Ages. Pogroms, ghettos, yellow patches... all rolled up and dumped like an old carpet, because Europe has gone past them. Prejudice dies harder. But has the mayor physically harmed a single Jew? Hermann, my dove, my firstborn! The goyim should give their right eye for what you've turned away! What's that, Mama? Family! Jew-hatred is about nothing but blood and kin. They used to hate us for killing Christ. Now they hate us for being Jews. God give my grandchildren the desert! Well... To a homeland for the Jews. Merry Christmas. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYS] (APPLAUSE) [CLOCK TICKS] Madam, Fräulein Jakobovicz. I've only just come in and found your note. I'm so sorry. – No, I'm sorry. – No, no, you were quite right to come. I'm all yours. Sit down, Hanna. Would you like tea? Nothing. Thank you, Hilde. [HANNA SNIFFS] – So, tell me, what is it? – Well... I thought everything was going to go on just the way things do. – Fritz? – Yes, yes, of course Fritz! Oh, Gretl... He was in such good spirits at the tea party. He was so nice about my dress and my hat. He couldn't have been more... – He was charming. – Yes, he was. And sincere. We had a jolly time, didn't we? I was quite sure there'd be a letter the next day, or flowers even. – And? – Nothing. I haven't heard from him at all. – What shall I do? – Oh, Hanna... – I'm sorry. – [HANNA SOBS] I wrote my thank-you, and now it's been more than a week, and I'm going home on Sunday. – Men! – (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) What I think is that he didn't understand my true feelings. His manners are so beautiful and he was being so amusing - reading those scenes with us. He's so funny. It's his way, you see, with anybody at all. He didn't realise that I love him. I might as well have turned up in a glass case. I've decided to write to him. I'm sure it's best to tell him everything, and I've brought it to show you. [HESITANTLY] Ah... Ah. – Do you think it's too long? – He doesn't deserve you. Yes, it's too long. I knew it was. Will you write it for me? [SIGHS] – If only I could find Theodore. – Who? Theodore! His friend, Theodore! I've been to the Imperial every day for coffee and sat there hoping Fritz or Theodore would come in. Sit! [HANNAH SNIFFS] "Dear Fritz. "I'm going home on Sunday, "so I've been thinking about my nice times in Vienna, "and none was more fun than tea with you. "So this is just to say thanks again, "and if the army ever sends you to Czernowitz, "I hope you'll look me up. "Your friend, Hanna." (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) "Dear Fritz..." Gretl, I wish I'd just turned up on my own and let him take off my hat and my coat and anything else he wanted! – (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) – Everything would have gone differently. It would. But you'd be sending the same letter. [BELL TOLLS IN DISTANCE] [CLOCK TICKS] I've had a letter from your little Jewess. I'm going to go to hell for this. Catholic hell. Do you want to know what it says? "Thank you, goodbye. Look me up if you're in Czernowitz." That's incredible! You should see her, Fritz, before she leaves. Make love to her. Oh, don't say things like that! If I give you back to her, perhaps it will make up for stealing you from her, – and I won't go to hell. – You don't believe in hell. I do now. Now that I'm a sinner. – Mm. – You're my first big sin. I'm not going to come here anymore. At least I won't have to live in terror of being seen. I don't know what's happened to me. Well... I know what's happened to me. You didn't steal me, I stole you. Yes, you did. I gave you no reason to pursue me, no reason at all. I was irreproachable. You were unforgivable! If Hanna wasn't such an innocent, she would have noticed. There was nothing to notice at my end. I was correct. You started getting undressed. Yes, you did. – You took off one of your gloves. – (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) I ignored it. I poured tea. And our hands met on the teapot handle. – [CHUCKLES] – You took a puff of my cigarette. I thought any moment you were going to sit on my lap. – Some chaperone! – Excuse me! Who got Hanna to play so he could ask the chaperone to dance? I was being in character. Who got us reading scenes from your improper book? Some aunt! I'm not her aunt! She's my sister-in-law's sister-in-law, I think, or she's Hermann's sister's husband's little si... Aunt! Honestly! I'm too old for this, that's true. I belong with Hermann. And I love him. – I'm going home to show him I love him. – Don't get dressed. – Show me first. – No. I'm serious. You're my last gentile. You love me, don't you, Gretl? I'm mad about you. But love is something else. Just as well, anyway, cos my portrait's nearly done, so I won't be able to keep disappearing in the afternoon. We'll see each other, won't we? Here and there. Dinner parties, salons... Dinner parties? Salons? We don't get invited by the same people. It's a case of my people and your husband's people, baptised or not. Concerts, then? Theatre? – Is that where you met Hermann? – No. A hunting party at Prince Rotenberg's. Really? Is Hermann that rich? Get dressed, Fritz, so you can find a cab for me. If he weren't baptised, he'd have to be a Rothschild to get invited. – Please... – You can't leave yet. It won't be dark for another hour. There's time to say goodbye. [BELL TOLLS] MAN: Hermann... – Are you unwell? – No. Uh, sorry if my message caused you anxiety. What do you think? We haven't decided where to hang it. Gretl favours the cloakroom. Well, it's... not bad. I'm sorry Gretl doesn't like it. Is she all right? Oh, yes. She had retired when I came in. I've been out to dinner. Willi von Baer's boys-only dinner to celebrate his birthday. It was at home. The Baron and Baroness were in the country, conveniently. There were twenty of us. I didn't know everybody. Well, I knew half of them, perhaps. Ugh! A lot to drink. Dinner, cards, billiards... – Oh, yes? – We played poker. I won a huge hand, and I won it with a bluff, which I then showed to some applause. – Hermann. – Yes? What? It's three o'clock in the morning. I know. Well, my opponent took it badly. But the moment passed, so I thought, and Willi proposed an adjournment to a certain house in Karntner Strasse where, he assured us, the ladies are regularly inspected for a medical certificate. The proposal was greeted with acclamation. I pleaded an early start. My opponent at cards then made an extraordinarily coarse joke, which I need not repeat to you, but I should give you some indication. It concerned the very personal inspection a gentleman was required to submit to, to establish his... bona fides at the more discriminating of such houses. – A comedian. – Willi, who is a decent chap, gave me a smile and a shrug, but our friend plunged on. Between the untouchable daughters of good families, he said, and the sweet young things of the working classes who were very likely to give you a dose, it didn't leave a man much. Even if one took the view, which he did, that a Jewess is not a Jew. Laughter and cheers. Oh, no, he said, the best bets were the wives of the bourgeoisie! Pretty young women who'd fulfilled their purpose by having a child or two and were now bored with nothing to do except take tea with each other. But best of all, he said, were the wives of rich Jews, factory owners and suchlike, because in Fritz's opinion - oh, his name was Fritz, a lieutenant in the Dragoons - in Fritz's opinion, these wives were voracious for sex with a gentile for anatomical reasons! I felt sorry for Willi presiding over such a gaffe. I was even sorry for Fritz, as though I'd watched helplessly a skier ski into a crevasse. I thought I'd better pull him out. "My dear fellow," I said, "we haven't been properly introduced. It's Willi's fault." "Oh," he said, "I know who you are." Dead silence. More fool me, eh? What did you do? Obviously, I said, "In that case, you'll be hearing from me," and I left! Hearing from you? Oh, no! Absolutely not! Because this idiot felt like insulting you over losing at cards? – It was my wife he was insulting! – He doesn't even know your wife! It was you! And you should've socked him and had done with it. Oh, you don't understand anything! In matters of honour, we don't hit each other. – What "we"? – Don't be obtuse. – You're not "we". – I'm not a gentleman? – Is this Fritz a gentleman? – Of course! An officer and a gentleman. Character doesn't come into it. If I don't go through with this comedy, I'll be a social pariah among my circle. Friendships I value. I don't want to discuss it anymore. I want this over with. – Ernst, I have the honour to ask you... – Why me? Because you're a doctor. These affairs might require a doctor. Who else could I ask? I want you to go and find the house in Karntner Strasse. – How on earth do I...? – Ask a policeman! Willi's party will be there till morning. Request an interview with von Baer. Present my compliments and ask Willi if he would do me the honour, firstly, of demanding an apology from his guest, failing which, secondly, to make the arrangements for a shooting match at first light with rules to be agreed on both sides. No. Are you insane? How would I face Gretl? I must say I expected a little more faith in me. I'm a very good shot. Then you'd be charged with murder, and, by the way, I thought you were a Catholic. A Catholic, an Austrian citizen, a patriot, a philanthropist, a patron of the arts, a man of good standing in society and the companion of aristocracy. My great-grandfather was a pedlar of cloth. His son had a tailor's shop in Leopoldstadt. My father imported the first steam-driven loom from America. They strove to lift me high! Absurd as it is, I would be repudiating them if I flinched now. Hermann, no offence, but don't you think you repudiated them by being baptised? No! They were Jews, they knew a bargain when they saw it. – (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) – Do you mind if I take that back? I would. [SIGHS] I can tell you the moment I decided not to be a Jew. My, um... Grandpa, mother's father, told me when I was nine or ten, how he once tossed a coin into the hat of a man playing a fiddle on a street corner. The man stopped playing and snatched Grandpa's cap off his head and threw it into the road and said, "Where's your manners, Jew?" "What did you do?" I said. "Why, I picked up my cap," Grandpa said. He had a good laugh about it. His hero was Bismarck. If he'd been able to choose his life, he said, he would have been a Prussian aristocrat. [LAUGHS] If this ends badly, I have written a note for Gretl. Otherwise, there is no need for her to know anything. I ask that of you. Ernst... we're both Christians! Good night, Hermann. [FOREBODING MUSIC] That was a damn good evening Willi laid on. I presume I may ask to what I owe the pleasure? It doesn't suit me for my wife to be made the object of scurrilous insinuations in the company of my friends. I will be satisfied if you admit the fault and apologise to me in writing, to include our understanding that I may show your letter to our host, and to anyone who was present, should I so choose. I don't recall saying anything that concerned you or your wife, Merz, and nothing that I need to apologise for. Then I take it that you mean to settle this business on the field of honour. The field of honour! [LAUGHS] What romance have you been reading? By God, I won't stand for this. Are you putting yourself at my disposal? One ball at twenty paces. A second ball at fifteen paces. I would consider myself satisfied. I'm afraid I can't oblige you. I can't fight a duel with you. In my reg
