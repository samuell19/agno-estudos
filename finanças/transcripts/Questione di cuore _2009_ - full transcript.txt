- Why aren't you writing? - Holy shit, look who's here! I'm on the last scene, I got a great idea. Tell me. I'll call you tomorrow. It's three months of "I'll call you tomorrow..." I'll call you tomorrow, really. You bought this dress... Let me think... for a girlfriend's wedding? Almost, a fake wedding of two gay friends. A poolside reception? I don't know, I skipped it. You were in love with the tall one, you found out he was gay so you stayed home. How do you know that? Who are you? I'd like it if you joined me at the Slurpee ice stand. Slurpee... Holy shit, what a noun! Hon'... You woke me up. Who's ever gonna sleep now? I dreamed I was eatin' a dish of bolts. I drenched 'em with motor oil. They're sittin' right here... the bolts from my dream! Maybe I'm hungry. Nurse... like a barracuda-bite. Something right here, it's surely a heart attack. First on the right, to the doctor. Maybe it's anxiety or you drank too much. But you gotta wait your turn, it's a madhouse... Rome! I'm having a heart attack and "I gotta wait my turn"! I've got anxiety... "Coffee in a glass". Not "a cup". What changes? Why? Why are you Romans like that? Come with me. - Everything's ok? - Sure. Sit right here, I'll call you in a minute. Attention, Code blue coming in. No assistant? Coronary unit, acute myocardial infarction, Bartoloni Angelo? Bartaloni, born in Rome, March 16, '67. Ventricular polymorphus extrasystole, lesion wave from V1 to V4. - Age? - 41. - Heart attacks in the family? - His father, young. - Deceased? - Yes. At what age? 40, 40-something... Hon', Perla smokes. You're kiddin'? I'll kill 'er. Ma'am, please... Hey, I'm having a heart attack. Hey, who diagnosed you? Me, sweetheart. - Are you alone? - Or in bad company? - Age? - 45. - Profession? - Screenwriter. You were right, there are alterations in the EKG. You're lucky you made it here. He snuck his way in here! - How? - I know how to crash a party. Cardiac arrest, make way. Can I make a call? So you're human, you do normal things. What should I say, "goodbye forever" or "bring my socks"? He's back! Angelo, can you hear me? - Is he conscious? - He's back! Now we withdraw the balloon that dilated the stenosis, and we insert the stent, a cylinder that keeps the artery dilated... Have you ever been to India? - The Indian Ocean. - The Maldives? - With your hot second wife? - Right. - A little hot or really hot? - The stent went in perfectly. Don't make me laugh. Really hot. - Why didn't you call me? - You were sleeping. - You saved yourself? - Who says I'm saved? Ma'am, time's up. We're alive, ain't we? Come on... You're Bartaloni Angelo, born in Rome on March 16, '67? Present. You're not from Rome, where're ya from? I'm from the North. Does that mean anything? Hear that mysterious word, North... You came to Rome for your pistons to fail? I've lived here since 1986. I was on my way back from the first job I'd found. Job... spreading mayonnaise on bread. It was July, a suffocating heat even at night, and I thought:... "They'll have to kick me out of this city." What's your name? Alberto. How d'ja know my name? That's the question. Eh? You passed ahead of me twice. Once in the E.R. and once in the operating room. The third time'll probably be in Paradise. No... My shift's over, I'll be back tonight. Don't move, you've got a cannula for emergencies. - Remove it, I want to socialize. - You talk too much already. "In my winter's night your sweet arrogance makes this affair distant, amusing." - Shut up! - Darling... Alb?. You said the woman on the balcony pulled out a pack of cigs. If she was naked, where'd she pull it out of? The last time I told that story, it was winter, she was naked under a raincoat with pockets. Is he laughing? Got it. I never expected this. Huh? Shit, you're so good-looking! Thanks, Alb?. You're a looker too. If you want to chat, turn on your right side. Careful... You, on your left. Don't talk much and you, quietly. For twelve hours we'll be checking a possible stent closure. See you tonight. Don't get worked up, ain't nobody dyin' before tonight. In '86 I bought my first set of wheels to fix up and sell. It was a junker, an Innocenti spider. Then I kept it ten years, even went on my honeymoon. I just loved that ride! Where did you go on your honeymoon? Wait... To Greece, no... Ireland. You went to Portugal, following the whole Spanish coast. But it poured and you almost never put the top down. I don't know... You're afraid of flying! Takin' a plane, it woulda rained the same! Are you nuts? Tell me, Angelo, do you still screw your wife? Why am I with her if we ain't even screwin'? Ever ask yourself why you got sick? If it was something poisonous, ferocious, wrong? My Pa died at my age. In his shop? You weren't there. Who was there? I don't wanna talk about it. My mother was bed-ridden for six months before she died. When she went to the hospital, they told me she'd just left. Then she died and they didn't tell me, but I understood on my own. Come with me. Auntie, can I tell her I got a B+ in history? - How old were you? - Nine. There they are! Carlo! - This time I'm faking. - You look good! Who's that? No, I'm not faking! Is that really Verdone the actor? Looks like a performance by a spaced-out artist, right? - It is Verdone! - Looks just like him. It's him! Hello. Stefania Sandrelli the actress! - You're fantastic! - Thank you. Your colleagues are over there. - Is that Stefania Sandrelli? - What a beautiful woman! Stefania! A real woman, finally! My mad cow! Not even a heart attack... The heart can go, but the dick stays! Ask if I can come in, I got something to say. I'll step out. Sorry, maybe all this commotion bothers you. No, it's fun. You're self-centered. "Coherence and purity"... Early Philip Roth! This heart attack didn't improve him. Buddy... Did they do a primary angioplasty? - Of course. - Did they put in a stent? - Synthetic or metal? - Normal, I think. Are you under double platelet anti-aggregation? - Aspirin plus Plavix? - How do I know? You gotta do it a year, or you'll meet your Maker. High dose statins, or you're a goner. - Who operated on you? - Professor Ricci. Carlo, fuck off! He's good, but call me when you do these things. Next time I have a heart attack, I'll come to your house. You know I know it all! Now go home, take it easy, no smoking or alcohol, take walks, screw without pills, calmly, you can do it, it's a matter of... - Bye. - I'll see you on Friday. - He's dead! - About a decade. Could I get a picture? - What's wrong with that guy? - Nothing... - They're really friends. - He told 'im to fuck off... See you soon. I'll show you something. Listen to this. See that kid, my son? What's his name? - What year was he born? - '99. You picked his name? Cars... the '90s... Michele for Alboreto! Almost! Is it an Italian name? No. Gilles! - Even greater. - Even greater... Airton! But you call him Irto! Visiting hours are over. - He's phenomenal! - Ma'am... Leave, Hon'. Come back though! This is a sterile environment! One minute! You're bats, all hanging on! Angelo, you're a girder! Let go of him, you won't fall! You always nosin' in people's business? Of course. Weasel, you slipped in! May I? You like spaghetti, don't you? I ain't fat, I'm knocked up. Take that! We'll see you later. Say bye to your Pa. - Ma'am! - I heard ya, just a second. Perla, let's go! I'm wasted. It's like working out. - But... - You... You first. Was that your girl? Yes, but we don't even screw anymore. - You can tell. - From what? From 'er face. Do you think I can't do it because she has that face, or does she have that face from not doing it? What's it you say? "That's the question". Hi, Alberto, it's Renato! I spoke to Galante's producer. He's pretending to be good. You have more time now. Payment on delivery obviously. Because he's an asshole! Did you call the interpreter? Who is it? A woman. What's happening? Nothin', don't think about it. - Is she dead? - No! No way! Watch that arm. If she dies, who'll tell him? Did you hear that sound? Exactly, the dead don't make sounds. It's disgusting, damn! Relax, nothin' happened. What matters is goin' home to tell others about it. A fat lady came in, no one understood her, she shouted then she died. It's not a good story. Then how 'bout a good one from you. What film are you writin'? A white story. Partisans in the snow. All men, no sex, what a pain... You know, there are homosexuals. Really? I ain't gonna go. Actually... If we get outta here, I'll go see a movie, I haven't been in ten years, and I'll go see the movie with queer partisans. I swear on the Madonna. Thanks, I'll do it. Hi, 11 and 12? You'd swear they were in kindergarten. - A new patient at 9. - There was... a ruptured aorta. Please, tell me more precisely. We've been married twelve years, been together fourteen. - How's it going? - It's going... Before his kidney transplant, he worked too, things were good. Now he's always home, he cooks but can't eat a thing. - What does he cook? - Everything, he was a chef. Now he cooks complicated things, but all he can eat is boiled rice. What did he cook for you today? Thrush in a wine reduction. With a fava bean puree. You made up the thrush part. I'm incapable of inventing anything. I see a girl in a green jersey under her smock and I imagine where she bought it, with who, why... I imagine. I thought she was askin' where you were hurtin' not that you're gettin' her life story! 11 and 12, aren't you tired of talking? It feels like my fuel injectors are all gunked up. Pistons go up and down and lose bits of aluminum that gunk everything up. That's how I feel, enough's enough... What do you mean "enough's enough"! We're young, dammit! These others are half cadavers. Fuck off! Careful, don't move! They removed my catheter and taped the wound. Not mine. Pa told me you smoke. It's not me I'm thinkin' of, it's them. - What the fuck are you saying! - Watch your mouth! Who said, his fortune-teller friend? Without me, those two'll massacre each other. You coulda ironed your brother's too. I'm goin' out. - Where? - To Denise's. - When'll you be back? - For dinner. Perla's unhappy about the baby, she doesn't know about sex yet. She's had to imagine you two doing it and she's repulsed. Oh! No, I lost my concentration! Instead, Airton doesn't leave the house. He's waiting for you. Do you trust that guy from the North? Come on! - Let's not. - I'm hungry, we have to try. We can't walk around... - You go, I'll... - Let's go! We have to try. I'll drag it myself. Got a lover? You're crazy. Actually, stupid! - I taped him up two hours ago! - We're hungry, that's a good sign! We're bursting with health! Could we order in some spaghetti with hot peppers and garlic? It's healthy, not like thrush in a wine reduction. How do we pay? Debit card. I don't want to scare you, but you haven't been released yet. You're in sub-intensive care and you're being asses! To bed, both of you! - Wait. - Let's go, come on. Go! She's right, we can't be... Was it your lover? Go... Was it your lover or not? Today? Now, come home with me. I'm not ready. It was a minor thing, discharge isn't abandonment. The hospital will send a nurse for therapy. In a month you'll get a stress test, you'll have to be in shape. Excuse me, I have to run. You'll have to get ready, an hour a day of fast walking, possibly every day. Sorry to tell you, but cocaine is very bad, it's toxic for the heart. Goodbye. It's bad... But he does blow! In what kind of hospital did you end up? - Handsome Tonino! Are you married? - Yes, why? - Where do you live? - In Acilia. An hour and a half from here... - Do you come by bus? - I have a motorcycle. Even in the rain? Better, it's an excuse to stay in town. If it rains, you get laid! It's a nurse? - That's right. - Good for our Tonino! Our Lenny Kravitz of Acilia. Here's the numbers for my cell, home and bodyshop. If you wanna... I spoke to your aunt, she's worried, she's guessed something, maybe you should call her. Right now, while I'm saying goodbye? Remind me to send her a message with my numbers. Goodbye. And me, where am I? - You can't work? - No. How will we pay the fucking rent? We pay 3,000 euro a month. 3,000... - What an absurd city... - I accepted Giorgio's show, four months of rehearsals and shows in Rome, you can relax for a while. This thing follows me... It follows me, everywhere... Ricci said to take Valium if you feel agitated. Valium paralyzes my mind. And my dick. Alberto, cut the crap. Don't lie to me. I'm with you because you always tell the truth. Don't go overboard, it was just a slight warning. What did I do wrong to deserve this? Being with you is what's wrong, you want the perfect husband! I'm just saying not to drink, smoke, over-eat... You nag, nag, nag... always saying I'm all wrong. "Go see an analyst", I went. "Let's get a house", and the house came. "Go see Galante so he'll give me a part." I never used your name and you know it! You shit! Fuck it. Try with fantasies, buy her erotic lingerie. Carla is young, lovely, independent. Do you wonder why she's with you? Because her feelings are sincere, don't waste them, don't let her leave. I'm here for the exercises. What's wrong? Is Mr. Alberto alright? I was meditating. I've meditated a lot since my heart attack, looking for myself. Found me! - How is it? I think it's dead. - Try a little more. - It doesn't seem too dead. I'd say you're wrong, it needs a defibrillator. Try mouth to mouth resuscitation. Are you nuts? The kids are coming! I miss you so much! I'm scared alone at home. Here we are! Now take him back. There was just sparkling. This hospital's cool, even got the room to yourself! Are you sorry your fortune-teller left? - Are you sorry? - I'm not sorry... He's got his life, his world. But he's not a fortune-teller. He's got imagination, he imagines. Ya know? It's different. That's us. 500 euro for the day, that includes driving to the church, the reception and back. Everything. No, the weekend's 1,000. Let me check. Pino? Keep going here, I got a customer. So... Sunday the 27th? Is Sunday the 27th available? - Sunday the 27th? - Check the calendar. Sunday the 27th is available. Via Fanfulla da Lodi, you know the Casilina road? Oh God! 12! - Nice of you to call me! - 11, you coulda called me too. - I lost your number. - I'd say on purpose. Then you don't understand a fucking thing. I brought you a present. It's a nice little heart-rate monitor with a pace counter, and it's rare. Do you go walkin'? - Not alone. - Me neither. If you wanna, we can go together. What will we think about all day? - That's the question? - Sure. Stenosis o' the stent is the answer. Then I bought that one down there, where we're livin'. Rossana was born in that house there. Then, I bought that one with the red flag. That too? I'm rentin' it to two Chinese whores. The guy upstairs put the flag 'cause the johns were ringin' his doorbell! When the time comes, Perla's gonna live there. Before, we were all in that house where Ma is. First, we were all there. Take off! Ma, you gotta go! Holy Mother of God... Since I got sick she's always checkin' on me, what a pain... I was sayin'? This neighborhood's startin' to come up. That's a lot of houses! I even got one in Turano, on the lake. Half an hour's drive, so peaceful! - It's where my Ma's from. - The bodyshop's doing okay! - I work clean. - Meaning? No traffikin' in plates... My Pa did though, back in the day... Please, take some water to my son, he's right outside. I built it up, I specialized, I just do antique cars, for me and other shops. I take a wreck and fix it fancy. Then I sell it. I won the "Classic Wheels" award, twice. Your Ma phoned. Say hi to her. - Want anythin'? - A catheter. Wow, you're keepin' so quiet! It's three days now. Wait. - What do you feel? - Let's get a taxi. There's a tram. Can ya make it? It's nothin'. Don't think about it, breathe. Breathe. You feel better if you breathe. I think that's Intensive Care. How's it goin'? Bad. I'm always scared. What kinda life are you livin'? I can't work, if I don't work I don't get paid, I'm in the red. Ain't got no savings? I've been getting by, from one screenplay to the next, for years. - How much d'ya need? - Knock it off! Pay it back when you start workin' again. I do not foresee that eventuality. You do not foresee that eventuality? - How's things with... - Carla. She's had enough of me. And your friends? Are you kidding me? Who do I have? Loredana! - What's this shouting? - Magnificent Tonino! - Get me Loredana? - You think you're at the stadium? Come on! Babe! How's it going? Here we are. I do this for you my lord and the honor of our lineage! You're dead, my lord. Or perhaps I am. That's enough. What's the reading? He's at 85% of the maximum and could have continued. Go to Ricci, he'll reduce your doses. How'd it go? Fine... I have a fabulous V5 and a V6, 85% of the maximum. I'm aimin' for 90. Kick their ass! Don't think about it, it'll alter the parameters if you're agitated. I won't think about it. 'bout what? Your father! - That's enough, stop. - I can do it. Talk to Ricci, I'll send him the report right away. - My percentage? - Hard to say. Let's say about 20%. 70 or 75%? 70! How can I tell ya? Seven zero! How else do I gotta say it? You only have to worry under 50. With this car you gotta double clutch on the curves. Know how to? Clutch, neutral, gas, clutch and downshift. - Like this? - Good! - Gas, clutch... how was it? - Yeah! Where're you goin' now? Where? Wherever you go, Carla left. Then we'll stick together. Come to my place, we'll stick together. Must be twenty years since I drove! Why don'tcha have a license? I failed the quiz three times. You flunked the quiz? You have a degree on Vistain, that German guy, what's his name? Watch your hands! How many times I gotta say it? Sir. See the seat? The floor's worn through, you gotta change it, or you'll plop to the ground like in a cartoon. There are two solutions: either I hit all the wreckin' yards, and time's money, or I do it myself, but it'll run ya a lot. So, what'll it be? It was my mother's... It was your Ma's? We can work it out. I'm rushed now, come by Tuesday for the estimate. - How much'll it run? - Minimum 15 grand. - Under-the-table? - Sure. With an invoice it'd be more. Like selling a story, actually not, since I pay taxes. Angelo, put me to work or I'll go nuts. It's the first time I've gone a whole day doing nothing. Wanna work? I'll set you up good. - Really? - You betcha! Where have you been hiding? All I do is write, night and day. You'll get it next week, don't worry. I just finished writing a blow-job. - What blow-job did you write? - Masterful, in the snow, at night. A white blow-job. - Who's that guy? - A friend of mine. He's helpin' out, I wasn't doin' too good lately. I heard, how are things now? - All okay. - Sit down here. You'll get the whole thing next week. - Look what I found for you. - A distributor from the 1400? - Original? - Just like sin. - How much? - Nothing, it's a gift. Wanna make me cry? Gimme a kiss. This guy's a phenomenon! See it's worn? The rust's eatin' it. You gotta make it brand new. It's like a patch on a suit. Ain't nobody does this kinda work no more. If a car door breaks, they chuck it. They don't waste time. But we like doin' it. - See if it fits perfect... - How do you block it? Ya block it with a blocker. Turn on the gas or the welder won't work, put the hood down or it'll hurt ya eyes.
