Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office Ma'am, any comment? Word is you murdered your husband in cold blood. What do you have to say? Did you really do it? Or is it another fabrication by the police? - Let us get by. - Ma'am! - Who's she? - Rie Munekata. - Hello, I'm Mr. Sugiyama. - Nice to meet you. As you are Mr. Kouda's fianc?e, you're going to have to testify. There you are. - Please leave, you're bothering the witness. - A couple of minutes can't hurt, right? Adultery's all the rage these days... Your dead husband, a professor, the north Alps: A great setting for a novel. Hey, no rough stuff! You're her lover, aren't you? Reporters are such a pain... Writing trash, just to make a story sound sensational. Thanks to them, the gallery is packed with people... but you've got to stay calm. You understand? A Wife's Confession Starring Fumiko Wakao & Hiroshi Kawaguchi Directed by Yasuzo Masumura - Defendant's name? - Ayako Takigawa. - Age? - I'm 28 years old. - Address? - 2/521, Akazutsumi, Setagaya, Tokyo. - Occupation? - I have none... Very well... The court is ready to proceed. The defendant is the late Mr. Takigawa's wife. On July 15th of 1961, together with Osamu Kouda, the three went climbing in the North Hotaka mountains in Nagano prefecture. While the three were climbing some cliffs, Mr. Takigawa, who was leading, slipped and fell. Osamu Kouda and the defendant, who were connected by safety rope, also fell, but Mr. Kouda held on. Therefore the defendant and her husband Takigawa were both hanging in the air by one rope. The fact is the defendant secretly had romantic feelings for Mr. Kouda, the relationship with her husband not being a very happy one. Seizing this opportunity, the defendant decided to kill her husband. By doing so, she will not only be free to pursue Mr. Kouda, but will receive her husband's life insurance of ?5,000,000. Pulling out her pocket knife, she cut the climbing rope, dropping Mr. Takigawa 500 meters down the canyon, resulting in his death. The charge: Murder. Penal code, 199. Does the defendant have anything to say in her defense? I did in fact cut the rope... but I didn't intend to kill my husband. I was just in so much pain. All I could think of was my survival. Mr. Kouda has been close, but nothing more than a friend. I've never given a thought to the insurance money either. Defense lawyer, your opinion? I deny the charge stated under the indictment. My client had no intent to murder when she cut the rope. Her life was in danger; she had no choice. In this case, a 'necessity defense' should apply. Therefore, my client pleads not guilty. What the hell is a 'necessity defense'? Don't you ever do your homework? Penal code 37... "When a certain conduct is absolutely necessary to prevent greater harm." So, if your damn life is at stake, you can pretty much do anything and get away with it. - Name? - Osamu Kouda. - Age? - 26. - Address? - 2356 Midorigaoka, Meguro, Tokyo. - Occupation? - I work for the General Affairs division at Toukaisei stock corporation. Does the witness know the defendant? - Yes, I do. - What sort of relationship? Her husband, Professor Takigawa, was an assistant professor at Tohto university, from where our company commissioned medical research. I was in charge of keeping in contact with him. Naturally, I got acquainted with Mrs. Takigawa. Did you see Mr. Takigawa often? Yes, I used to consult with him often. I suppose I saw him at least once a month. Had you ever gone climbing with Mr. Takigawa? He's the one who taught me to climb. I've been to the mountains with him about five times. In this incident, you left Tokyo on July 12th. Tell me what happened. We took a night train out of Shinjuku, arriving in Matsumoto on the 13th. That night we passed by the main hotel... and instead stayed at the "Yokou mountain cottage". On the 14th, we approached Yokou canyon... and climbed the "Kitaho". Next day, on the 15th, we got to the ridges... around 8 o'clock. How was the weather that day? It was mostly sunny, which is pretty unusual. Was it windy? Almost still... We got to the "C" face of the mountain by 9 o'clock, and to the "B" face of the mountain a little past 10. And at around 11... This is where the accident happened, right? Yes, on the last section of the "B" face. Were you able to see the two below you at that moment? No, I wasn't. I was pressed against the rocks, and couldn't move. Then what did you do? Someone suddenly fell. I heard a loud noise, and my rope became lighter. When I tried pulling it back up... What happened? Did you cut it? This is the rope and knife you used, correct? Yes. The deceased looked terrible. We usually try not to show the body to the mother or wife of the deceased... Was that the case for this incident? No. Mrs. Takigawa insisted on seeing the body, so I showed her. How did she react? She didn't cry or lose it, like most wives. I thought she was scary, rather cold. As a local policeman, I have seen many stranded climbers over the years, - but never anything this abnormal. - How so? The fact that the Mrs. Takigawa cut her husband's rope. Why is that abnormal? A wife should stick with her husband till the end, no matter how tough it is... That's what human companionship is. My wife also thinks that's how a married couple should act. Conducting a background search, I found that she was to receive a large sum of insurance money, and also discovered that she was in an intimate relationship with Mr. Kouda. I decided to make the arrest... - You said that a wife cutting her husband's safety rope is abnormal. - Yes. What if she cut a stranger's rope? In that case, I don't think there's a problem. That's odd; you can do one thing and get charged with murder, but have no problem the other way. Ridiculous, isn't it? Hi, Mom? I'm with Mr. Kouda. I'll be home after dinner. - Your mother? - Yes. I'll pay the usual way. I'll include it on your father's bill... By the way, miss... When are you getting married? - I wonder... - So nice... Girls these days are so optimistic... The prosecution's terrible. All they're trying to do is to create a murderer. I'm not so sure... I feel like the prosecutor's in the right. Why? Because that woman really loves you. She's not the type. That's why she cut the rope: With the intention of killing her husband. You're just influenced by the papers. That's not it. One woman understands another... You like her too, don't you? Give me a break! I just feel sorry for her. She's certainly more beautiful than me. - What the hell are you talking about? - No need to play dumb. I know what's going on... We used to go out all the time, but these days... I wonder if we can really call ourselves 'engaged'. I'm busy with work and the trial. - Do you hate me? - Of course not. If you don't love me, be honest. I can break off our engagement anytime. It'll be hard for me, but I will. You just misunderstand. More, please. Hey Kouda, rough case you're involved in. Well, sir, a handsome guy often has bad luck... kind of like a tax! I'm sorry to embarrass the company in any way. No worries - it's rather good advertising! You sure are in a great position... Plus, you're engaged to the daughter of our best client. I'd be fired if this were to happen to me... Damn you! - Mr. Kouda, a visitor. - Who? Someone named 'Tazeaka'. Mr. Kouda... Excuse me! It was you... I'm sorry; I thought it would trouble you if I gave my real name. What did you come see me for? Let?s get out of here. What can I do for you? Nothing, really... I just wanted to talk to you. How rude! It's alright, I'm used to it by now.... Everybody thinks I killed my husband. I get cold stares everywhere. You're the only one who treats me with respect. But... This must be terribly unpleasant for you. Of course, it doesn't feel great, but what can I do? I'm a murder suspect on bail. I must deal with it the best I can. That's not true. I guess I'm famous... My picture's everywhere. I'm quite the star! You bastard! So, this is the lover? Bit of a hunk, isn't he? A bit early in the day for a date, isn't it? Sir, I'm terribly sorry, but do you mind? Let's go. Ma'am, let's go somewhere quiet. - Quiet? - My apartment. Thank you very much! Taste bad? It's cheap coffee, you know... No, it's actually quite good. I'm finally alone with you... Like another cup? Oh, I wanted to see you so badly... Lately, I've been cooped up at home, 'cause I'm too frightened to go out. I've been all alone... I was so sad, I felt like crying... It's especially scary at night. Women just can't live alone... how pathetic. Sometimes I ask myself, "Do I really deserve this kind of treatment?" - Ma'am... - What? Are you sure what you did was right? Did you really cut the rope because you were in pain? Or... - Are you accusing me of murder? - I will never tell a soul. Please, at least tell me the truth. Ma'am, you shouldn't come see him like this. - I've asked you many times, yet you've already forgotten? - I brought her here. You better watch it yourself... If the prosecutor finds out, they'll use this against her in court. Well, just make sure you don't see each again. If you do have to, run it by me first. Understood? I'm sorry. Can I see you for a second? - There's just one thing... - What is it? Are you sure there's nothing between you two? - Intimately, I mean? - No. If there was, you must tell me, so I can defend her accordingly. I don't lie. Well, that's a relief. I came over 'cause I was worried. Sorry for the accusation. Let's go home, ma'am. I'll drive you. Excuse me... - Good night. - Come on. Ms. Rie, sorry to be so persistent, but please do your best testifying tomorrow. See you. What's this about? It's about whether or not you have any special feelings for Mrs. Takigawa. What do you mean? I still feel the same: You're both in love with one another. Are you going to testify against her? Then you want me to lie? You care for her that much? I just feel sorry for her. Her marriage was an unhappy one... she's always suffered. When did the defendant marry Mr. Takigawa? Five years ago... When I was at university, studying pharmacology. Your reason for marriage? He proposed out of the blue... at the lab... After the war, I became an orphan at age 11 and was raised by my uncle. Staying at my uncle's wasn't always easy, so I was eager to finish my studies and become independent as a pharmacist as soon as possible. Because I didn't receive much of a scholarship, I earned some money doing routine chores and by helping to prepare research... for Takigawa, who was an assistant professor. I was over-worked and suffered from fatigue, malnutrition and depression... I even thought of suicide. Wow, you sure are sweating a lot! I've been working out in the cold... Get me a towel. - Have you finished what I asked? - Yes. Here. - Does it look OK? - Yeah. I'll be off then. What the hell is this? It's my dinner. - Please give it back. - You're eating terrible food. Please give it back. Look how weak you are. You look anemic. Hey, why don't we get married? I agreed to marry him... I wanted to get out of the lifestyle I had. You married for your quality of life... So you never loved him from the start? But I tried hard to become a good wife. I quit school, I went climbing with him, I even started wearing kimonos because he liked them. I did try to love him... But.. Going climbing again? I've got time off; I'll be gone for about a month. I worry about you... Can't you cancel your trip? I'm not stupid enough to die in the mountains. Unlike young climbers, I'm well trained. Japanese mountains are like my backyard. I can traverse them with my eyes closed. Even so, I want you to quit. Cut it out and get me some food for the trip. Here's the list. I think... I'm pregnant. So why don't you stop climbing... - Shut up! Climbing is my life. - But if you love your child... - Why don't you get an abortion? - Are you serious? We don't need a child yet. We're too poor. - My salary of ?40,000 won't cut it. - But I want to have one. I said no, and that's final. - You don't love me, do you? - -Nonsense! - You prefer the mountains over me. - Shut up! What am I to you? Some housekeeper who works hard everyday? A secretary who organizes and makes copies of your thesis? A cheap maid? I can't even have a child, how pathetic! My husband didn't love me, he just used me. But isn't it absurd to blame everything on him? You yourself married him to better your standard of living. Wasn't this marriage a mistake from the beginning? Yes, you're right. That's why I tried to start over... A divorce? I can't stand living this way anymore. - I want to live on my own. - I see! Please divorce me. - No way. - Why not? I have no complaints. Everything's great. - I don't want this anymore. - Hey, you wanna drink? Fine then, I'm going to court. Useless - you'll lose anyway. - There's no way I'll lose. - You don't seem to understand the law. You can't just break up a marriage 'cause you're sick of me. It's not that easy. You won't get away with it. But there're lots of divorce cases... You can get a divorce if I agree to it, but I won't. I don't have an illness, I'm not mad, I've never been unfaithful... I'm a splendid husband. If I say no, there's no way. Even if the marriage itself was a mistake? You'll never get your divorce. Too bad. Give it a rest. I do think of you... We're getting a maid starting tomorrow, so you can take it easy around the house. You wanted a divorce, but he wouldn't agree. Therefore you were at a dead end. Yes. That's around the time Mr. Kouda started visiting frequently, isn't it? That's correct... How does it look? I couldn't have done it myself. Thank you very much. We finally have a shelf. My husband never helps me. - He's cold-hearted. - He must be busy. That's right: Busy climbing mountains. He's cheerful so long as he's happy. He doesn't care a thing about me. - That's ridiculous. - Go ahead. Thanks. Are you having any? Alright, then... You're very kind... Your future wife is a very lucky woman. Cheers! So that's when you started to flirt with the young Mr. Kouda? That's not true. I was selfish to suddenly bring up divorce. I thought I must try to love my husband and build a happy home. - Are you telling the truth? - I won't lie. You were a close friend of Mr. Takigawa's, correct? Yes, we were members of the alpine club when we were students. He often came to my shop to buy climbing equipment, even after graduation. We were friends for a long time... Drinking was another of our common interests. How did you feel when you heard of this case? Honestly, I thought... She's done it... - "Done it?" - That Mrs. Takigawa killed him. Why did you think that? - I remembered what Takigawa had told me in the past. - What about? It was roughly October of last year... We were at a bar in Ginza... Hey, my wife is apparently in love with some guy. Now the French will call me a fully-fledged husband! It's 'cause you're always in the mountains! - You better learn from this, and give her some fun more often. - No use... I'm her father's age... I'm no fun for her. She wants someone young. Why not kick her out? She sounds like a tramp. She'd be ecstatic to get kicked out. What will you do? I'm gonna keep her as my wife forever, and take away her freedom. - Good thinking. - She must be mortified... I'm sure she wants to kill me... How funny! Why do you hate her so much? Hate...? The truth is, I find her endearing. Then why don't you be honest and treat her nice? Too late. I was born rough. You can't make me do any of that lovey-dovey crap, not over my dead body! - You didn't ask who this man was? - No. - But he did say that the defendant had a young lover, correct? - Yes... Also, the night before his last trip to the mountains... Stop it! - The next trip should be interesting. - Why's that? I'm taking my wife and her young lover. - Guess where to? - No idea. A secret location where no time waits... The Takidani rocks of the Hotaka mountains. Both my wife and her lover are complete amateurs. I'm gonna torment them both. Give it a rest. A mountain's no place for that. You're disgraceful! I guess I'm an evil guy... Remember, chickens come home to roost. Ouch! And now this... The whole thing sends shivers down my spine. Please bear in mind that any false or untrue testimony will result in punishment by law. Who did Mr. Takigawa think his wife's lover was? - Mr. Osamu Kouda. - You're sure? He said it clearly. How did you feel about them? - I'm not surprised they were accused of being lovers. - How so? I saw something... The professor suspected her. Whenever he got back, he would ask me to tell him everything that had gone on while he was away. I'm not the type to act like a spy. Is it true that you held her? Yes, but just once... Good evening. I brought some medicine. - Bring in some tea. - Yes, ma'am. Here're the sleeping pills... these are the vitamins, it's our own brand, so no guarantee they?ll work... I can't thank you enough. Is there something wrong? You look a little pale. No, I'm fine. Where's the professor? He's been staying out late recently. It must be hard for you. Mr. Kouda... Did you recommended that my husband buy life insurance? Yes, is there a problem? I knew it! Actually, when I came to drop off the research fund... - Hello. - Hi. There was a ?10,000 increase; you'll now be getting ?30,000, starting this month. Wow, that's good news. Now I get one extra beer every night. Wanna go out for a drink tonight? - Professor, I see you don't have any life insurance plan. - Nope. - Why don't you get a plan for ?1,000,000 or so? - Why? The mountains could be dangerous, even to an experienced climber like yourself. How much would that cost? - Probably about 5 or 6,000 yen a month. - That'd be a total waste of money. - How come? - I won't die that easily. - There's always the chance. - No way! But... I'm sure you're wife is uneasy about it. - Did she ask you to bring this up? - No, but she must feel... You sure pay close attention to my wife's feelings... Why? I hear you're visiting my place quite often, while I'm away. I've been delivering medicine to your wife. Aren't you a little overly considerate? Are you suspicious of me? Pretty rude! Don't you think it's a husband's duty to have a life insurance policy? - Is that so...? - Why don't you take better care of your wife? You're certainly very difficult to talk to! I'm sorry. I was out of line... But there's nothing between your wife and I. Please trust me. The plan you recommended him was a ?1,000,000 liability insurance... Correct? - Yes. - But the paperwork shows that it's for ?5,000,000. Who changed it? Was it you? Was it his wife? No. It was professor Takigawa himself. According to his wife... This is odd... He didn't even want it for ?1,000,000. It's his dirty tricks... I hear he hates my guts. Hates you? Last night... Give me some water! Water! I'll tell you something interesting... Kouda told me to apply, for your sake. He has the hots for you. Aren't you happy? He's engaged. He can break it off anytime. You love him too, right!? Stop kidding around! When I die, you'll get the 5,000,000 and Kouda... Sounds like a dream! Drunken fool! I'm not gonna croak that easily. The insurance company gave me a physical today. They say that I'm as healthy as a horse. They suspect I'll live to 80, easy! You must be disappointed! - You should cancel this insurance policy! -Why? How are we supposed to pay ?30,800 every month? Your salary is 50,000, Mr. Kouda brings 30,000... We'll lose nearly half. Well, it's your job to juggle expenses! I'm gonna keep climbing and keep drinking... Please cancel it. No way, you guys are the ones who came up with the damn thing. I won't cancel! We'll just keep paying the monthly fees for 15 years. What's that damn look for!? You wanna kill me? I know what you're thinking! What's this? Potassium cyanide? Isn't it? Why the hell do you have this?! - I tried to kill myself. - What?! When I was a student... I took it from your lab. Don't bullshit me. But I don't think that way anymore. It's foolish to die. So you're gonna kill me instead? Kill me then! Stop talking nonsense. I'm trying to start over as your wife. Like I believe you... You're a frightening woman! Here's your water. You think I can drink this poison?! Hey, get me some water! Water... I was so angry... I was furious, I don't know what to do! I'm sorry... It's my fault for mentioning the insurance plan. No, it's not your fault. He seriously has issues... I don't understand why he's so hard on you. - I guess it's my fault. - No way! You're a good person. Really? You really mean that? I feel sorry for you. You're the only one on my side. I've always been so sad and lonely... Please stay this way forever. So there were no romantic feelings involved... You were just feeling sympathetic towards her. - It was all just Mr. Takigawa's imagination, correct? - Yes. You will not need to mention anything that may change the outcome of this trial. When did you get engaged to Mr. Kouda? Last October. Were you aware of Mr. Kouda and the defendant's relationship? Yes... Mr. Kouda was seeing her quite often. - What for? - I have no idea. What's Mr. Kouda like these days? He's a great fianc?e. He takes me to out on dates all the time. Do you think he loves Mr. Takigawa's wife? I don't think so... He must feel sorry for her, though. Did you ask him how he felt? I trust him. - Your parents are aware of your engagement, correct? - Yes. We plan to marry, after the trial is over. No further questions. Thanks, Rie. Why should you thank me? But you've testified for us. It's not for anyone. I testified for myself. I felt sorry for myself... I too am a woman... Do you think I can testify that you loved her more than you love me? That'd be like declaring how worthless I am. Get out. I won't be seeing you for a while... Not until you can really love me. Goodbye. I have this ongoing bet about how Kouda's trial will end. - Who with? - A chick at a bar. - And? What did you bet on? - "Not guilty," of course. - What did you bet? If I win, we go to a hotel in Atami for one night. If I lose, I pay her ?10,000. Hello? Yes, speaking... I've been sick in bed since last night... I can't break the fever I have... I'm sad, I feel terrible... I think I might die.... Can't you take care of me? Did you call a doctor? Don't have any money to call one. OK, I'm on my way. A monetary gift? Our company's made quite a bit of money from Mr Takigawa's work. We now sell three medicines created from his research. But his wife's the one who killed him... Isn't it odd to give her money? - So you believe what the prosecutor says? - Well, sort of... So you're suspicious of me as well! No, you're completely innocent... But people are nosy; you're better off not seeing her. You have a great fianc?e. I understand. Then can I get an advanced pay check? You're so young! What's the matter? You're crying... I'm just so happy. It's not much, but this is from my company. You're lying... I've been such a burden to you. Ever since the insurance incident... It must be fate. You're the only one who cares about me. Without you, I'd probably have killed myself. What's there to live for? If I'm found guilty, I'll have to go to prison. Even if they find me innocent, people will still keep talking about me... That's not true. I know very well... Please, please don't leave me. Ma'am, there's one thing I want to ask you... What is it? Did you really cut the rope because you were suffering? Please tell me the truth. Were you in pain? Or did you want him dead? You still can't trust me, can you? I guess I look like the type who'd kill her husband. Am I that evil? Am I a devil? Please look at me! Please say I'm not! Go! Go home! Please, just go! Why are you acting so foolishly? Why is it foolish? I'm in love with you. Ever since the whole insurance thing... There's no point in living if you're not even... trusted by your loved ones. I really don't need to be alive. I have this dream every night. Not about my dead husband... It's about you. It's about us being together. I love you so much... I dare you. How cruel of you! Ma'am, I also like you... I might even love you. You're lying... You'd trust me, if you loved me. Isn't it so? Isn't it? Ma'am, I believe you. I'm so happy! Have you ever climbed the rocks where this accident happened? Yes; it's a very tricky area. If you fell and were hanging from a rope, what would you need to do to survive? I'm not sure... But Mr. Kouda wouldn't be able to pull the two of them up. Holding on to them would be the best he could do. Even so, they wouldn't last over half an hour. Meaning? All three would fall down the canyon. So there's really no chance of survival? If Mr. Takigawa had an extra strap, he could have tied it round, - and climbed up the rope, little by little. - But he had no extra strap. Then the only way is if he'd jumped over to the nearest rock. "Jumped over"? He would have had to swing his body like a pendulum, got close to the rocks and jumped over. - Is that always possible? - Not always... It all depends on the distance of the rock, what it looks like, if the rock is flat enough... That sort of thing. What would you say in this case? I have no way of knowing, unless I hung there by a rope myself. How do you feel about the defendant cutting the rope? All climbers know that it's taboo to do such a thing. And what if you were in her shoes? I would have... done my best to try and get everyone out of that situation, and not cut the rope. - Is this tied the way it was on the day of the incident? - Yes. What would happen if you were hanging in this way? Because of the force at both ends, the rope would tighten around the chest. It would be very painful, especially for a woman. What would happen if this continued? - She would probably faint. - And then? She would probably die in about an hour. You said that you would try anything possible, and not cut the rope... Even if you were fainting? That's not what I meant. So you're saying that there's not much choice in such a situation, right? I guess not. She is a woman, after all. How much time passed between Mr. Takigawa falling and the rope being cut? I'm not sure... I was struggling, so... You must remember roughly. Maybe it wasn't, but it felt like a long time. How long was it until you cut the rope? I don't remember... I was in so much pain... 20 minutes? 10 minutes? Speak up! I don't remember. You cut the rope with this knife, correct? - Yes. - That's strange... Why did you have a knife? You were rock climbing. What was it for? Were you planning on... - I always take it to the mountains with me! - Was it easy to cut the rope? - No. - Of course... You were cutting with a tiny knife, not to mention you were in pain. Did you see Mr. Takigawa below, while you were cutting the rope? - I really don't remember... - You're lying! You must have had a good view of him! You stared at his face and cut the rope, with no hesitation. How horrifying... Did you feel sorry for him? Yes, I did... But I had no choice... - I thought all three of us could die. - You're lying... If you felt sorry, why were you so cool when you saw his dead body? It's a fact that you'd not been climbing with your husband for about two years. Why did you change your mind for this trip? Were you waiting for the right moment to kill your husband? No, I wanted to start over with him. - To try to love him? - Yes... Then why didn't you try harder, until you fainted? The defendant had enough strength to cut through the rope... What are you trying to say? What do you want me to say? That I killed my husband? Is that what you want to hear? If that's the case, I'll say it... I did kill him. I killed him! I killed him! I killed him! Your honor, this question is... Anything from the prosecutor? The defendant was Mr. Takigawa's wife. It was her duty to hang on, even if she was fainting. She should have chosen to share the same destiny as her husband. But the defendant had no love towards her husband. Since she'd wanted a divorce for a while, she took this opportunity to murder him. This is the truth of this case. I demand the penalty of two years' imprisonment. It would be a moving tale if she not only cut the rope holding him, but cut hers as well, so that the couple both fell and died. "If he must die, let us die together..." That sort of thing. But that is just a moving story, not human instinct. Every man loves himself best... I wonder how many wives would actually decide to die with their husbands... when they have a clear chance to survive? I suspect that most wives would do exactly what the defendant has done. The prosecutor's statement completely ignores human instincts, and is making an unfair point that wives should sacrifice themselves for their husbands. Therefore, I plead the defendant is not guilty. This will conclude the trial. Does the defendant have anything to say? How do you feel about your dead husband? My husband loved the mountains... It was probably his desire to die there. Do you hope and pray that he will rest in peace? What would be your next step, if you were free to go? I would like to get married and be happy. I feel that it was my unhappy marriage to my husband... that got me mixed up in this whole mess. What you said was not good. You ruined everything. But.... what the prosecutor said was horrible. Even so, you shouldn't have gotten so emotional. It's absurd. Will she be found guilty? Well, I doubt that... I've got a meeting for another case. Excuse me. I'm sure I will get convicted... I'm going to jail. - You don't know that yet. - It's quite alright... But Mr. Kouda, can you stay by me until we get the verdict? Will you love me... strongly? I just want to live in peace until my day comes. Then I won't care what happens to me anymore. So... I understand. I'll be taking some time off work. There was something I used to think about a lot when I was very little... Someday, somewhere, I would meet someone very special... And we would go to a beautiful ocean, ride in nice boats, and dine at romantic restaurants. Stay in a hotel with flower-patterned wall paper... That special someone was always with me, and I now know it was you. This must be a dream. It's not a dream. What's wrong? I'm being silly. I'm having such a great time, and I don't know why I'm crying. But tomorrow's judgment day. This is our last night together. That's not true. Let's stay together forever. What? Ma'am, would you marry me? What's so funny? You have Rie... Your fianc?e. Never mind her... She'll still be happy without me. But not you... You need me. Are you feeling sorry for me? No... I love you. I'm an evil woman, who killed her husband. That's what the prosecutor is saying... But there's no way you would do such a thing. You're innocent. But what do you think people will say... "That shameless pair, who conspired to kill a husband." Who cares? We believe in one another. I don't mind clueless talk. What if they find me guilty? I'll wait for you... Wait until you're released. Thank you! All Rise! Year 1961, case number 369, murder charge. The defendant, Ayako Takigawa, come forward. I will now deliver the court's judgment... How was it? The defendant won. She's innocent. That's not gonna be much of an article. If she was guilty, we couldn't badmouth the court. How's this? "Married couple in crisis: Watch out husbands," - "your wife may be after your life." - Forget it! - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. You gave me quite a hard time with your case. - I'm sorry. - I'll look forward to a good reward. Oh, and I'll call the insurance company and see that you get your money. See you later. - Mr. Sugiyama... - Yes? - She was innocent after all. - Yes, at least in court she was... But I really have no way of knowing. I'm just satisfied that we established a new "necessity defense" precedent. See you. What's the matter? You still feel like you're on trial? I've had enough! Will you hold my hand and walk with me? Of course. We can walk together like this forever. That's right. It's a nice day. You're marrying her? That's pretty daring! I know you've gone out of your way to arrange my engagement with Rie, but I'd like to call it off. - She's that great? - Chief... Or are you marrying her for her insurance money? You trying to insult me!? Kouda... I think you should think it over. You're too young to know, but that woman's trouble. You're gonna ruin your life. Hey, lover boy! Congratulations! You wanna go get a drink, to celebrate your happy future? No, I got plans tonight. With your fianc?e? You're finally getting married. Yup? Please hold. Date-planning call. Hello. Yes, it's me. "Chiyoda Apartment"? Yes, moved in today... Will you come by at 6, as promised? I want to celebrate my move. I'll be cooking a feast. See you later. Welcome back! Master... Isn't it nice? But why the sudden move? Too many bad memories at the old house, and the neighbors are hard to deal with. I've always wanted to move into this type of apartment. It must have cost a lot. No problem - I just used the insurance money. - Insurance money? - Yes... I'm going to buy modern furniture and some curtains as well. We'll have an elegant home by the time we marry. - Ayako... - Yes? - I don't make much money. - This is too much. - This is normal. I don't want to live here. Why not? I don't want to touch the insurance money. Why? What do you mean, why? You don't mind at all? Would you like some? Live nicely with the insurance money... It sounds exactly like what the prosecutor was saying. We should use the insurance money to pay for the professor's grave, and donate the rest to the university. But what's wrong with spending it on our happiness? We can be happy in my dirty apartment... As long as we're together. But... Hey, let's have a drink, OK? Will you pour me a glass? What are we toasting to? What do you mean? To the insurance money? To ?5,000,000? This is terrible... Why are you bullying me? Because you're being insensitive. You're a coward. A coward? You're probably afraid of what people will think. You're scared of what they'll say. - That's not the case. - Then I guess you don't love me! Hey! That's it, that's why you bully me... If you loved me, you would be happy for me. I finally found our own place... Forget it, I'll drink alone. - You don't understand how I feel? - No, I don't! - Not at all? No idea. You have no idea how I feel, either! Let go! - Don't bother. - But... I'm sorry... It was my fault. You're right... I'll leave this place. I won't touch the insurance money either. So please don't be angry... Please... You're bleeding a lot... It must hurt. I'm alright. It's like that time... You were bleeding from your hand... It hurt so bad... I felt terrible. I felt your pain like it was my own. When you screamed, I screamed... But Takigawa kept swinging his body back and forth... I hated him for that. Selfish man... Didn't care how much others were suffering. He'd do anything to live... A terrible man... Egotistical... My husband should die... That's when... I realized then... Who I really love... It's you who I love... Mr. Kouda, it's you. What is it? So you did kill him... You killed him 'cause you hated him, right? The prosecutor was right... - You were actually guilty! - You're scaring me! Why didn't you tell me!? Why did you keep quiet? I thought you would look down on me, like everyone else. I thought you would leave me! You deceived me... Not just me, but everyone. Deceived the court! You're a dreadful person. That's why you don't mind spending the insurance money. But you would also be dead if I hadn't cut the rope. I wanted to save you! I wish you hadn't. Really? You really think that? I don't want to be here, I'm going home. No, please don't go! Please wait, please! Please don't leave me alone. When I'm alone... Are you going to kill yourself? Stop pretending. You won't fool me anymore. "Pretending"? Hello? What do you want? I'm leaving for Osaka tonight... I'd like to meet with you and talk before I leave. I thought we were no longer engaged... There's nothing to talk about. It's about Mrs. Takigawa... I want you to hear something about her. Fine, I'll visit you at your work. Why on earth did you volunteer to go to Osaka? It's only going to slow your career down. What a pity! You were the company hotshot. - What are you gonna do with your fianc?e? Taking her with you? - No. This whole thing's such a mystery... - Mr. Kouda, someone here to see you. - Who? Ayako Takigawa. - Tell her I'm not in. - No use... see? Was this a bad idea? I can't talk here. What are you doing here? Are you still angry at me? You never answer my calls... - It's terrible. - Do you know why? I know... I understand very well. I've been thinking of you everyday since... Look, I've gotten so thin. My watch and my ring... ...are both so loose. Look... After giving it a lot of thought, I now understand that you were right. I left the apartment, and got a refund. I've got all the insurance money, untouched. Please, I'll do anything you say. Please look at me... I'm not as terrible as you think I am. I'm weak... I'm just in love with you... All I did was sacrifice everything I had for you... That's all. I need to be alone and think for a while. I can't marry... I'm not asking for marriage; I just want you to see me once in a while... Once every two weeks, or even once a month... Won't you see me? I don't know what to do. No... You don't want to? Then how about once a year? Please... Once every two years, three years... Please. You did save my life. I'm not here to accuse you of anything. But even so, killing a person is wrong. I apologized... I wonder if a person capable of killing can also be capable of love? It's clear... I shouldn't see you. - Please wait! - Goodbye. Good luck with everything. I do have a murderer's face... You were right about everything. I was clueless, I was a fool... What now? - I'm breaking up with her. - How come? - What do you mean? - Don't you love her? - I do. I do, but... - That's a lie. You don't love her. You never loved anyone... Not her, not me... I'm not so sure I even loved you myself... She was the only one who really loved someone. She risked her life by loving you. - She killed someone, in order to love. - But... Women are all like that; we only love in our hearts. Women will do anything for love. Men are the ones who call us stupid and crazy. I wish I could live like her... but I don't have the courage. I'm timid... I admire her... Why won't you hold on to her? Even if she is a murderer... I feel sorry for her. Get an ambulance!!! - What happened? - A woman died... Poisoned herself, or something... He's here. She's that... I told you so... Look what she's done... And in our building... It's addressed to you. One check for ?5,000,000. "Dear Mr. Kouda, I know you won't want to, but please spend this money... "Even if you plan on marrying Ms Rie. -- Ayako." I have a couple of things to ask you. Please stick around. You're a material witness. Mr. Kouda, you killed her... If she's a murderer, you're also a murderer. Goodbye... I won't be seeing you again.
