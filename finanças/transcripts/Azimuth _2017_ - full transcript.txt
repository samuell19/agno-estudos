What'’s his name? - Mushon. Moshiko. -Moshiko, give us a hand. -Come here. Again? -Try to put this in here. -Let'’s put it in. What do you think? This will help? -Let'’s try again. Maybe we'’ll succeed. -Get in. Start her up. Release! Release the clutch slowly. -Release the clutch in one go! Give it full gas! -No. Not in one go! You'’ll break the gear box! Fuck the gear box! Let it burn for fuck sake! Okay, she won'’t budge. I told you not to come this way, I told you. I wanted to take a shortcut. I passed here twice already. Come on, let'’s try again. Again? What again? How many times can we try? Listen, he'’s got a jerrycan with water on that jeep. I say let'’s pour water on the sand, it will harden and we'’ll get her out. You know how much water you need for the sand to harden? A full tanker won'’t even do it. -Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? -What do you want? You'’re not pouring water on the desert even if we wait here a year. So what then? What then? We wait here until Messiah comes? Try to reach command again. I tried. The radio is dead. So, what now? Someone has to go with the jeep. To get help. To go with the jeep? The Egyptians are still all around here. The war is over. There is nothing to be afraid of. Anyway, if there are any Egyptians, they'’re all dead by now. They don'’t have any water. Where from? I'’m not going. I'’ll go, okay? It'’s crazy to go alone. But we have no choice, no choice! There are weapons, ammunition, at least two soldiers have to guard them. You can'’t abandon ammunition to the care of one soldier. And a man'’s life is okay to abandon? Believe me, let me go, I know the way. -I'’ll make it, I promise you. -No, no, no, no... I know the way, let me... You'’re the driver of the command car and you'’ll stay with him. I'’ll go. That'’s crazy, you don'’t know the way. You'’ll get lost. It'’s all sand dunes. You didn'’t know the way the first time either. Come on, let'’s not waste time. Tell me where to go. -It'’s crazy. -Come on. Drive straight... There are tire marks... Follow the marks. After six or seven kilometers there'’s a turn. Take it all the way to the end. That'’s it. Stand next to him. A war souvenir. We'’ll be here. Be right back. Come back. This is the voice of Israel from Jerusalem. Shalom. Good morning. It is 8 am. Here is the news read by Dan Kaner. The cease fire with Egypt went into effect yesterday. Even though shortly prior-- Egypt announced they will continue the war until the last drop of blood. According to the announcement, the Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, agreed to the cease fire. Prime minister, Levi Eshkol said that the State of Israel... You think he'’ll come back? He won'’t come back. Agh! Damn it... If you think you are going to take the jeep... You'’re dreaming! Do you hear me? Are you still alive? What? English, English! You son of a bitch. I said if you think you can take the Jeep and escape, you'’re dreaming! The war is over you idiot! Yeah, and I'’m Moshe Dayan. It ended yesterday! You'’re lying! Why would I lie to you? Because you'’re a Jew. It ended last night. You'’d say anything to take that Jeep. You don'’t believe me? No! So you can go to hell. You can go to the desert and die there like your friends die. Hey. Where am I in that photograph of yours? You? The entire photograph is you. Desert sands? Yes. Yes, desert sands. Hot, burning, endless. And I get lost in them. You know sometimes I think it'’s just an excuse. What'’s just an excuse? That you always come here to take pictures. It'’s an excuse for you to ravish me on these hot sands. You know... it would be nice if after one of these excuses, you'’d have some news for me. What kind of news? A tiny bit of news. A tiny bit of news. Really? You really mean it? The sands are my first memory. I was four or five when my father, a fourth generation Jerusalemite, took us one day to some place in the sands and said, "Here'’s where we'’ll build our home." And my mother, a Holocaust survivor, started to cry. And so did I. I didn'’t know why my mother was crying, but I saw her crying, so I felt that I should cry too, Years later she told me that after all she went through those isolated sands frightened her. But my father just laughed and said, "You'’ll see what a magnificent home we'’ll build here." And he was right. The arguments he would have with the builders... They'’d be digging and he would shout at them, "More! Deeper! Another half a meter!" He would say, "Whoever wishes to build his life on the sands, "must deepen his roots." And when they finished building, they brought fresh soil, they covered the sand, and fertilized, and watered and my mother used to watch them and say, "Okay, okay, but you really expect that shrubs and trees will grow here?" And my father looked at her and laughed. And once again he was right. And now they come and want to destroy all this. They want to destroy and eliminate everything we'’ve built and throw us into the sea. You up there? You talk to me? No, to Moshe Dayan. What? What do you want? How is this going to end? You know how this is going to end. Either I kill you... Or you kill me. And you think that'’s okay?! What do you want me to do, huh? Let you go? With the jeep? It is myJeep, you know. You think I'’m going to let you take it? That'’s not going to happen, habbibi. You can walk, then you'’ll be ok. Your friends will find you. They'’ll pick you up. In this desert? Nobody knows where to go in this desert. As you wish. What? As you wish. I have nothing to lose. All right. All right. Listen... I have an idea. What now? We throw down our weapons. We will both throw down our weapons in the sand. And drive away from here. And go where? You will come with me. Oh, I'’ll be your prisoner? How lucky for me. We won'’t harm you. Isn'’t it better than dying out here? What, to go get killed over there? We don'’t kill our prisoners. I did not go to war to be a prisoner. Yes. You went off to win, right? See what a victory we gave you? We just lost one battle! One battle! It happens in war! We'’re not finished yet. Yes you are finished! Agh, habbibi... We won. Listen... Let'’s think about ourselves, okay? About you and me. How do we get out of this mess? This is how we get out. Isn'’t anyone waiting for you back home? You piece of shit! You have 24 hours, use them well. Mind your own business, homeboy. We don'’t want to carry you on a stretcher from your wife'’s bed. Goodnight, Abdo. Goodnight, homeboy. "...We haven'’t been fighting for weeks now. "The fighting has ended, thank God." Thank God. Thank God, the fighting is over. -The war is over. -Please, continue. "Fortunately, instead of staying in the desert of Yemen, we were transferred to Sana'’a. We don'’t do much here. And since the fighting has ended, some are saying that we should be leaving Yemen, and returning to Egypt, God willing." They'’re returning to Egypt? They'’re coming back. yes! -Did he say when? -No, he didn'’t say. "Anyway, don'’t worry about me. The only thing that worries me..." Peace be with you. Rashid? How are you doing, Samira? How are you doing, Mother? I can'’t believe my eyes. You got the letter? Yes, we got it! I'’m glad you got it, I just wanted you to know I'’m fine. Listen, I wasn'’t able to tell you at dinner, but... they'’re going to take us again tomorrow night. Where to? They say Sinai. War again? That'’s what they say. With the Jews? Who else? But they'’re saying this time we'’ll win. We have more weapons. Haven'’t we gone through enough wars? Your son will grow up without a father. Your mother is old. And I can'’t handle all this by myself. I need you by my side, Rash. What can I do, Samira? I am powerless. They tell us to go there, we go. Come here, we come. We do what we'’re told. But I'’m worried about you. Don'’t worry, my queen. God is on our side. And we'’ll win. I promise you I'’ll come back to you and Ali in one piece. God willing. Your son will grow up without a father. Hey you down there, you still alive? What? What did you say? I asked if you'’re still alive. Oh, you'’re worried about me now? I'’m willing to discuss a way out of here. Oh, now you'’re willing, eh? Yes. How can I trust you? What are you up to now? Let'’s just find a way out. All right. Let'’s hear it. I said let'’s hear it! I heard you! I'’m thinking, I'’m thinking. You see? I can also throw bombs. So, will it happen? - A war? I believe so. It'’s a serious problem. It'’s not a joke. I'’d say it'’s not good at all. -Hello. -Hello. I'’ll take cigarettes, Ascot, and a paper. -There you go. -There you go. You want something, soldier? No, thanks. -So, will it happen? -It'’ll happen. Of course, it will. We should get ready.
