- [Inspector Garcia] Take the handcuffs off. Switch on the lights please. You hear me? - [Officer] Yes sir, inspector. - Go on now, do your number. - You mean the number we used to put on here? Would you mind telling us why we should strip for you for free? And what's more, that's precisely what we've been put in jail for. - You be nice girls now and do exactly as you're told. - Without music and dressed in prison clothes? And who are you anyway, ordering us around? - Come on, he wants us to put on our show in Sing Sing. (laughing) - Do your number. - But we forgot it. - Let's fake it, come on. - I'll forgive you if you're out of step. Now stop pretending you're artists. - Don't you worry. Let's just move around and then strip. Don't worry, we'll give them a hard-on. All right, follow me. (both humming cabaret music) That a girl, that's it. (both humming cabaret music) - Is that the best you can do? It's outright shit! - Oh, we used to excite them plenty. - You've gotta be kidding. - Yeah! Well what the hell do you think they sent us to jail for? - Well show me, then. (both humming cabaret music) You both look ridiculous (Cecile and Brigitte humming cabaret music) What the hell do you think you're doing? You call this piece of shit a striptease? You're terrible. They'll do. - Get dressed. - Thank you. - [Inspector Garcia] Come with me. You've been sentenced to a year in jail. Is that right? - Yes, we've already put in two months. - Would you like to be free as of right now? - You bet. - I can work it out so you'll be free in return for a little favor I'll ask you. - Oh, I'll sleep with you. - Oh, don't be stupid. I've got a job for you, in a nightclub. I've lined up a month-long contract for the both of you. You'll live in a big hotel and you'll get paid. - Clue me in. - This is the view from your window. Look at it, do you like it? - Sure I do. - See that house across the street? - Sure. - I want you to photograph anybody who walks in, that's all. - How do you know I'm a photographer? - We know everything. Do you get it? Maybe the house is empty, but if it's not, you photograph everything. Anybody who walks in. That's your job. Anybody walks in there, you get in touch with us right away. And give us the negatives, that's it. Our contact will wait for you every day at their airport. But... Don't talk about this with anybody, not even your partner. You get it? - Yes, I understand. You spoke about an airport. Where are we going? - Las Palmas, in the Canarys. - Oh. And what if they throw us into jail? They may have a law against striptease. - Oh, it's a pretty liberal country, don't worry. - [Cecile] How do I recognize your contact there? - No problem. He works in the same club, The Flamingo. He's the choreographer. - Well what's the man like? - Oh, you won't have anything to complain about. - [Cecile] Ah. (Cecile laughing) (door creaking) - Who's there? Hey, who's there? Did somebody come in? (door creaking) Is somebody here? (door creaking) Who are you? - No cause for alarm, we're friends. (Adriana gasping) Let me go, let me go! (Adriana whimpering) Oh no! No! Oh, no! No! Stop it, no! No! Let me go, no! (Adriana groaning) (Adriana crying) Stop it! Stop it! Let me go! No! No! (Adriana crying and whimpering) No, no! (birds chirping) (slow jazz music) - [Irina] Adriana Rinaldi. The most beautiful nymphet in erotic films. Your movies have made you one of the most desirable creatures on the face of the earth. One of my clients, Alberto Capuano, known as The Lonely Millionaire, wants you for himself alone. You'll belong to him, body and soul, and you'll submit to his slightest whims. You no longer possess a will of your own, Adriana. Look at this fiery opal. Obey my orders. Forget your past. You have no will of your own. The opal leads you into a void. You have but one master, Adriana. Alberto Capuano. (upbeat jazz music) - Wow! Hey, are you girls the lesbian act? - [Cecile] Yes we are. - [Milton] Welcome, I'm the emcee at The Flamingo. Come on, I'll drive you, you're safe with me. (Cecile and Brigitte laughing) - All right, I'm coming. Hello, good morning. - Oh, it's big! - I'll pick you up for rehearsal at four. - All right. - You're not coming up? - You should unpack and take a shower. - [Brigitte] Come up and scrub my pack. - Oh, you French girls are divine, but you're absolutely sex-crazy. (Cecile and Brigitte laughing) (birds chirping) - [Brigitte] Cecile, come here, I'm drowning! (Cecile laughing) - [Cecile] Yes, your highness? What is your wish? - Miss please will you scrub my back? - [Cecile] I'd be glad to, your highness. Your slightest wish is my command. Where's the soap? Oh, there it is. - Now be gentle with me. - [Cecile] Yes, your highness. (Cecile and Brigitte laughing) - Oh wonderful, I see you haven't lost your touch. (giggling) You're the best back scrubber I ever had. Up and to the left. (moaning) - [Cecile] You like that, huh? (Brigitte giggling) (smooth jazz music) - [Cecile] One, two, three and turn. - And now? Now forward, right? - Once again. - What do we do now? - Slip a leg over the stool. - Right. - Let's go. We're bad. - Yeah. - We better shake it again. Come on, shake! Let's take it from the top. - [Brigitte] I forget. - [Cecile] How can you forget? All we do is shake our ass. - [Brigitte] You're a big help. - [Cecile] All right, what you do is move your left foot right and your right foot left. Do you get that? Put your hands on your ass. Go. Now, stick your butt out. One, two, three, four, five. - [Brigitte] What do we do now? - [Cecile] The same thing, shake. - You like 'em, boss? - They're pretty. - You can trust me, boss. I know how to pick them. Oh, I forgot to put all the spots! - Once again? - Okay. Right, that's it. - Which one? (birds chirping) - [Guard] You got a light, man? - [Guard] Here's 10 cents, go buy yourself some matches. - [Guard] You motherfucker. - [Guard] Not your mother, man. Come on, let's take a look around. - [Guard] All right. - [Guard] This is the easiest gig I ever had. (camera shutter clicking) Here's your light. - [Guard] Thanks, just for that, I'll hold your hand and we stroll around the block. - [Guard] Fuck you, Matilda. - [Guard] Fuck you, brother. - No, I don't drink. (Brigitte laughing) - I've got aquavit, cognac, gin. - You won't make me drink any of that shit. - How about some good old French champagne? - Ooh, you got me. Champagne is my weakness. - [Brigitte] Great. (Brigitte giggling) - So where's the champagne? - Now, do you want it before or after we make it? - Now what are you talking about? (Brigitte giggling) - You'll find out. I'll put on some music. There you go. - Ooh. (gentle music) That's nice. Delicious. Ooh! (chuckling) I love music, it's such a thrill. (birds chirping) - [Sam] Let's get some air in here. You can hardly breathe. - [Joanne] That's right, air's what I need. - [Sam] Joanne, come here. - [Joanne] No. - [Alberto] Come here, I said. (Joanne groaning) - [Joanne] I want to get out of here. I've been cooped up here with your son for months. I hate him. He's crazy. I want to get out of here. - [Sam] Be reasonable, Joanne, calm down. He likes you and so do I. I won't let you go. It cost me a fortune getting you here. - [Joanne] You'll never convince me to stay with that idiot son of yours, never! (Joanne crying) (camera shutter clicking) I want to go, you can't keep me here locked up forever with that half-wit! You'll have to let me out, so let me out! - [Sam's Son] Daddy, I want her. - [Sam] Be quiet. - [Sam's Son] I love her, I want her. - [Sam] Shut up! - [Sam's Son] Don't let her go, I'll die if she leaves. I can't live without her, I love her! - [Sam] I said let me handle it. - [Sam's Son] And why doesn't she sing anymore? I want her to sing like she does on her records. Tell her to sing for me! - [Sam] I bought her here for you but I can't get her to sing for you. (birds chirping) - [Joanne] Help, call the police! I'm Joanne Taylor, I've been kidnapped! - [Sam] Get back in here! (Joanne screaming) Take her back to her own room, and don't let her get out of it again! - [Sam's Son] Yes, yes! (Joanne groaning) - [Joanne] No, don't, leave me alone! (Joanne groaning) No! Stop it! Stop, leave me alone! I can't go through with this again! Don't, don't do it! Let me go! No, no! (Joanne screaming) No, cut it out! No, please! Oh! (Joanne groaning) No! (Joanne crying) Stop it! No! Oh, that's enough! (camera shutter clicking) (Joanne crying and groaning) (breathing heavy) (birds chirping) (camera shutter clicking) - [Guard] You there! Let's get her! Hey, so there you are. Come on down or I'll shoot. - [Parrot] Sure thing, me darling. - [Guard] Oh, it's the goddamn parrot. - [Guard] Why don't you just go fuck yourself? - [Parrot] Sure thing, darling. (guard groaning) Oh me darling, oh me darling. Clementine. (gentle music) - [Joanne] What, again? No, no, I can't go through this again! - [Sam's Son] I love you, I love you, I love you! - [Milton] What are you doing? - [Brigitte] What do you think? - Oh, stop it! (Brigitte giggling) Oh, stop! Stop it! Oh, you bitch! A filthy little bitch, that's what you are! Oh! - Hey! We've been at it for hours, where have you been hiding? - Nowhere, I've been walking in the park, that's all. (Brigitte giggling) (Milton groaning) - See? I managed to talk him into it. Now he likes it. (Milton groaning) - I can see that. - Help! (Milton groaning) She's raping me! Shit! Shit! Rape! (Milton screaming) (Brigitte laughing) (laughing) - [Brigitte] Let's see if he doesn't like it. (Milton groaning) (Brigitte moaning) (laughing) - Poor dear! (upbeat jazz music) Yeah, groovy place. - Hello, may I invite you for a drink? - [Cecile] Of course. - Cecile, Brigitte, let me present Mr. Connolly, an American senator. - How do you do? - Didn't I meet you somewhere before? - I don't think so. I'm a senator from California. - Oh, you're from Texas. Didn't I see you in a western? Oh, I know, you posed for a cigarette ad with a horse and a bunch of cows. - No, I don't think I did, but that's very nice of you anyway. - Oh, thanks. (Brigitte giggling) (waves crashing) - [Mr. Forbes] Good morning, darling. - [Irina] How did it go? - [Mr. Forbes] Just fine. We handed over Adriana to her new master. - Was Mr. Capuano there? - Yes. He personally gave me the money as planned. - In small bills? - Mmhmm. Is anything wrong? - I don't like the idea of you sleeping with these girls. - What have we here? You're jealous. - [Irina] I couldn't care less. - That's precisely why I sleep with them, because you don't care about me anymore. - Don't be stupid. I'm too busy to make love, that's all. It's our big deal and I'm not like you. - A big deal, but how much will be left when we're through? - Much more than we've ever had before. - True, but we're taking all the risks, and the pie's been sliced so many ways, we'll end up with a crumb. - You're just plain dumb. If we didn't have those bigwigs protecting us, we never could have pulled it off. (waves crashing) - I'm worried. I checked out the new act. It's some bitches that are working for the police. Something's fishy. (waves crashing) - Who's behind it? - Connolly. He's investigating for the Senate. - Let's find out who the girls are. - You're right. I'll get onto it. We'll make them talk. Another couple of deals and we'll get the hell out of here. It's getting too hot around these parts. (waves crashing) (Irina moaning) (Brigitte and Senator Connolly moaning) - Oh yeah! You're wonderful. Marvelous! - You really mean that? - Huh? Yeah. - You really like it? - Oh yes. You're, oh! - Just what am I? - You're, oh! - What am I doing here? - Oh, wonderful. - You expect me to share that opinion? - No. But it was nice. - What are you doing? You mean it's all over? - No. That was just so we'd get to know each other. - You've got quite a sense of humor. (birds chirping) - [Mr. Forbes] Good morning, darling. - [Irina] You're right. One of the girls works for Connolly and the police. - [Mr. Forbes] I told you. We've got to get rid of them. - [Irina] Do you think they've picked up on something? They both look completely stupid. Here you go, sweetie. - Let's grab Cecile and get her over here. You can trust me to make her talk. - I trust you. The girl's waking up. - Let's go. (Estrella groaning) (Estrella breathing heavy) - Please... Tell my father... Tell him... - You little fool. Your father is too busy. He's a very busy man. We're your only way out of here. - It can't be true. Please... Please... - Look. (slow jazz music) Look. You're going to fall in love with Aristobulas Farquas. He's waiting for you on his yacht. We are going to take you there. You'll be very happy with him. He's fabulously rich. You'll like him. You'll fall in love with him. In fact, you're already in love with him. You are. You are in love with him. (Estrella groaning) We've got to get her over there tomorrow. Before she dies. Get the helicopter to stand by. She's gonna die on us. (Estrella groaning) (smooth jazz music) - Our act's better. (both giggling) - [Waitress] What'll you have, sir? - [Mr. Forbes] Make it a glass of scotch on the rocks. - [Waitress] Scotch on the rocks it is. Thank you. - That's what I call class for a change. Those broads know how to shake it. - Where were you born, darling? - Right here, but I happen to be something else. - The girls are pretty enough, I admit, but they don't have two cents' worth of imagination. (club patrons applauding) - Whew, hard day at the office. How are you coming along with Mr. Connolly? - Who's he? - Your American friend. - Is that what his name is? Me, I call him cowboy. - Ride him hard? - He sure ain't riding me hard. He's pooped out. - Is that bad? - Yep. Fastest draw in the west. - Better fast draw than none. - He gave me a big ring, with a big sapphire. Not bad. And where were you, girl? You weren't around when I got back home. - Well, you know, I just walked around here and there for a while. It was a beautiful night. - Don't you go taking me for an idiot. (giggling) Now if you don't to tell me, that's your business. So long. - Bye now. You're seeing Hopalong Cassidy? - Yes, I've got room for another couple of rings. (both laughing) Try not to catch a cold if you go out for another long stroll. - Wait here, I'll get the car. - Okay. What do you want? (Cecile groaning) - [Milton] Oh, shit! (Cecile groaning) - I love Aristobulas Farquas. I'm glad I'll see him today. I love Aristobulas Farquas. I want to see him today. I love Aristobulas Farquas. I want to see him today. I love Aristobulas Farquas. I'll see him today. I love Aristobulas... - [Cecile] Who are you? - I love Aristobulas Farquas. I want to see him today. - [Cecile] Hey, who are you? Huh, who are you? - I love Aristobulas Farquas and I want... - I believe you, I'm convinced you're in love with him. Who are you? What are you doing here? - I, Estrella Shelwin, and I'll soon go away from here... In a helicopter. The man I love, Aristobulas Farquas... - Estrella Shelwin? You've been kidnapped. - I love Aristobulas... (doorknob rattling) - [Irina] Open the door. - [Kidnapper] Yes ma'am. - [Irina] Did she come to? - [Kidnapper] I don't know ma'am, I didn't look. - [Irina] Let's find out. - [Kidnapper] Yes ma'am. - [Irina] Don't you just yes ma'am me, open the door. - I love Aristobulas... (slow jazz music) - Poor soul. A bunch of sadists. They won't harm you anymore. I know they're rough but I won't let them molest you again. I hate violence. Don't look at me like that, I'm not like them. You'll tell me everything I want to know. You will, I know you will. Look, relax. Don't think. Let your mind go blank. You feel much better now, isn't that right? - [Cecile] Yes. - Good. Look at the ring. The ring. Listen to me, darling. You're going to tell me everything. I want to know why you came here, and who sent you to spy on us. - I will. I will. Everything. - Who sent you here? Now, tell me now. - Senator Connolly. He's investigating. - Who knows about us? - The police, the senator. They know about the girls. (helicopter blades whirring) - She's asleep. - We'll take care of her later. - [Kidnapper] Hope we can have some fun. - [Kidnapper] Yeah, but first, let's get her into the chopper. Look at her. They must have snatched her right off the set. - [Kidnapper] Yeah, some far out space movie. She's supposed to be some martian. - [Kidnapper] Oh, a martian? Some trip. - [Kidnapper] Well, she's going on another. - [Kidnapper] Some girls have all the luck. - I love Aristobulas... - [Kidnapper] I'll tell Mrs. Forbes it's all set. - All right. (kidnapper groaning) - Shit, it's that spy! She put on Estrella's clothes! - Let's get after her. She can't be very far. (helicopter blades whirring) I don't see her anymore. She must be hiding somewhere behind the rocks. There. There. (machine gun firing) (Cecile screaming) (screaming) - Who the fuck is he? - I don't want any witnesses. - Get into the car, quick! - [Kidnapper] Don't worry, we'll get her. (Cecile sobbing) - Hey, I got you out of this mess, didn't I? Look, I'm here now, it's all right. - Aren't you just plain dumb? - I sure am dumb. I should have left you stew in your own juice for a while. It was only a submachine gun. What's more, she didn't shoot straight. - Why does everybody trying to kill me? (sobbing) - Because you're stupid. - Just a bunch of killers. - Where do you want to go now? - My hotel. - That's just fine. Great. Now if you really want to die, that's fine, go to your hotel. You really want them to kill you? They'll kill you fast. You'll see. Don't worry about it. I've got something else worked out for you. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) - Hey. - Hi. - How you doing? - I'd like to ask you a favor. I've got a friend in the car and I'd like to-- - No problem. It's not very comfortable, but there's plenty of room. And if you're staying the night-- (whistles) Hey... Hey, you into girls, or what? - No, but my mom was. - No shit? - Oh, don't be silly. Take another look, it's a boy. You better get your eyes checked. Kidding aside, I'd like you to meet Cecile, a good friend of mine. An absolutely grand girl. She's adorable, but she's in trouble. Can she stay here? - [Juan] Yeah. - [Hippie] Hey, Milton! - Shit, what's that racket? - [Hippie] Hey look, who's the broad? - Eh, she's a friend of Milton's. He wants us to take care of her. - I'll be first, okay? - [Juan] No way man, I saw her first, and I get her first. Anyway, it's her pick. (Juan laughing) - [Mac] Shit, I came out to the desert for some peace and quiet. Can't even sleep without a bunch of kooks waking you up. (laughing) - Here comes the Lord. Man. - Hey Mac, I need you. This girl here, Cecile, she's got herself in a big mess. - Running away? - [Milton] It's that Flamingo crowd. - Yeah? - They're after her ass. - [Mac] That so? - She's got a bunch of goons after her. They want to kill her, I swear it's true. The cops are in on it too. Now you've done it before, you know the score. I'm asking you to hide her out 'til the heat's off. A few days, or maybe longer. 'Til those motherfuckers get them off her back, okay? I want you to consider her a friend. Don't let me down, fellas. - Milton, you're a friend of ours, a brother. Anybody who needs help will get it from us. Particularly when capitalistic pigs are after her. - Oh, thanks. - Don't you worry, Milton. The girl's safe here with us, you got my word. (hippies cheering) (gentle music) - Tell me the truth. You're sure you're not the cowboy in that cigarette ad with the cows and horses and whatnot? - [Senator Connolly] No, and I'm not the camel in the cool ad either. - But your face looks so familiar. Got a memory like an elephant. (Senator Connolly laughing) I know I've seen you somewhere before. - [Senator Connolly] Are you gonna run through every animal on Noah's Ark or what? - No! I know, at Lulu's in San Francisco. - [Senator Connolly] Don't know no Lulu. - You were at Jackie's in Reno? - [Senator Connolly] Wrong again. - [Brigitte] Do you know Luigi Slim on Route 88? - No. - [Brigitte] Do you know Josh Mocatobojevich? (Brigitte and Senator Connolly laughing) - At least he sounds interesting. - [Brigitte] Where the hell was it then? - Well, we did meet once. In a state prison. You've been arrested with your friend. - [Brigitte] Ah, so you're a cop. - [Senator Connolly] Nope, I'm a politician. - You prick. I'm wondering... You trying to spy on me and my friend? - That's correct, you guessed it. - Oh, then you mean that all that fucking was just a con? Swear it's true. - More or less. - You're disgusting. Son of a bitch. (door slamming) (birds chirping) (smooth jazz music) - Could you prepare Miss Perry's bill? I'll get her things. - Yes, sir. Oh please, sir. - Yes? - Is the other lady staying? - You better ask her. - Uh, just a moment. She hasn't been in her room for the last two days. - Oh, I wouldn't worry. She met some man. You know how women are. Don't worry. - Oh, yes. - Excuse me, I've got a letter for Miss Cecile Perry. - Thank you. - Uh, sir. Do you suppose she wasn't happy? - Of course she was. She was! Except, for the filth, and the spade she found in the closet. But the bellboy was a great lay. Toodle-loo. Stop worrying. - Thank you. - I think you'd better talk, darling. We can be very gentle, yet very mean. (Brigitte whimpering) - Don't think we don't know about your girlfriend, Cecile. (Brigitte groaning) - You probably don't know much, but you'll tell us all you know. From what I understand, you and her are lovers. - Well, we made love a few times, but when we were both in jail. What harm is there in that? Everybody did it. We both like men. We're not dykes. I don't know anything about the deal she made. I swear, I don't know nothing. (Brigitte groaning) - That's pretty... (Mr. Forbes growling) Isn't the beautiful? You won't be nearly as pretty by the time the guards are through with you. - What for? - To make you talk, darling. I'm sentimental, but they're not. - Stop it, please! - They won't caress you. Wait and see what they'll do to you. (Brigitte gasping) (Brigitte whimpering) Talk, darling. - I don't know a thing! Nobody tells me nothing. They all think I'm just stupid. Don't hurt me! - I won't. But the guards will. (Brigitte groaning) Yes, you do have a beautiful body. Hmm... Ah... Ooh... - That's enough. We're wasting time. We better use her as bait so we can get back her girlfriend. - What are you gonna do to her? (Brigitte whimpering) Stop it! (upbeat acoustic guitar music) (hippies clapping) - What's with this getup you're wearing? - Ah, it's a long story. - Here, blow your mind. - I've never tried yet. - Go on then. It'll take your mind off things. - I don't feel a thing. - Just wait a while. - What do you smoke that shit for? - Shit is right. - Put this on. You'll catch your death of cold. - Thank you. - Slip this garb on, Garbo. - Nice tits. (hippies laughing) Let's get back down with the crowd. Here now. - Your neck sore? I'll fix that. - Oh, yeah. - Bend your head, yeah. - All right. - Come on. - Okay. - [Mac] Have a nice ball. - [Female Hippie] Hey Juan, call me if you need any help. - I'll send up a flare, okay? (Cecile and Juan laughing) - [Milton] You filthy sex-crazy little pigs. Caught you, didn't I? Well you better forget about it. I want to talk with her, like right now. - I'll be back in a jiffy. - Hey, you can't leave me like that, huh? Hey! - You seen this woman before? - Seems to me I've seen her at Morales'. - Read this. - Joanne Simone. Yeah, the singer. The famous soprano who disappeared six months ago. After a concert in Atlantic City. Yeah, I remember that. But what's it got to do with us? - [Milton] I'll tell you. - I wouldn't mind. - Well nobody can simply vanish into thin air. Get what I mean? There's been no demand for ransom. No body was found. Other artists disappeared, and most of them just as mysteriously. Brit Pilker, the lady sailor. And there's Renata Baldi, you know? The Italian opera siner. Maria Valle, the mime from Paris. - [Cecile] You mean that Forbes kidnapped every one of them? - Yes, plus some others. The last one is Estrella Shelwin. She was kidnapped from her pool. That was last week. And you know what's funny? She was wearing the very same bathing suit I picked you up in. What I figure from is that the Forbes are behind every one of those kidnappings. The story goes, all these people are drugged and sold to sick multimillionaire admirers. Get it? That's what you're mixed up in. And by the way, where's your friend? - Brigitte? I don't know. - There was this letter for you at the hotel, read it. - "Dear Cecile, if you want your friend Brigitte Lemoine "to stay alive, come to the club at 4:00 a.m., "and come alone." - Don't go, it's a fucking trap. - I'll see, I've got to go. - [Senator Connolly] You can't protect people like that, your excellency. - Ah, you think I protect them? I follow instructions, no more, and certainly not less. You know this Connolly, I follow policy, I don't make it. - Don't tell me you have instructions to protect kidnappers? You've got to help me find out the truth, and see that justice is done. - Oh, that's noble of you, senator. But you wouldn't be angling to build up your reputation with an eye to the next election? - Cut the bull. Even if it were true, the fact remains we're dealing with a bunch of kidnappers. - I gave you a lead, but you couldn't follow up on it, isn't that right? We've got a girl in there, Cecile Perry. (Senator Connolly scoffs) - A prostitute. You expect me to make any headway with some girl we pulled out of jail? - Ah, but you picked her yourself. You know the score, Connolly. We couldn't give you one of our operatives. - Why? - You're asking why? Because, the Forbes sometimes work for us. - What do you mean? You knew they were behind it all the while? - Oh, behind it is saying too much. Let's say they carry out orders from important people much higher up. - The mafia? - Don't be a small boy, Connolly. The mafia is more respectable than men in politics. Kennedy was murdered by these men and Martin Luther King. They financed their murder, as they're financing terrorists throughout the world. - I get it. There's no way I can count on you. I'm going to see the federal police. - Do you believe they're not in on it? Their hands are tied. They depend on the capital, and the capital depends on Washington. And they won't act without approval. - I don't believe it. There must be some honest people. People I can trust. (laughing) - There are many, but, not in government. - I'm sure. That day will come. Honest men will come to power. - In that case, they won't stay honest. You never should have come here, Connolly. You should have stayed in the Senate. They like noble sentiments over there, whereas here, you're like a fish out of water, if you know what I mean. Oh by the way, did you know Brigitte, the girl you spent a couple of nights with is in fact a transvestite, or should I say, a man who got an operation to change sex, you know? - You should be ashamed. Goodbye. - Hello? This is Butler. Connolly just left. We've got to find a way out of this. - [Man] The orders are we need a scapegoat, and Morales has been fingered. - He's a powerful man. - [Man] Yes, but not enough. What's more, he's got one of the girls for his half-wit son, and he's keeping her in his own home. That's thoughtless and dangerous. He goes, and he goes fast. - And the Forbes? - [Man] Headquarters say we need them, at least for a while. Morales is to be held alone responsible. That'll be the official version. - Ah, if he talks? - [Man] Nobody is going to squeal. Nobody. How much do I owe you? (gun firing) (Senator Connolly groaning) - [Taxi Driver] Oh my God, he's dead. They killed him! Not even a tip. Goddamn it, right in my cab! - You want me to see you to the door? - No darling, they'd kill us. Drive around the corner and wait for me. (light fixtures creaking) Anybody here? Is anybody here? Is anybody here? Brigitte! No! (Brigitte groaning) Brigitte! Why? - You shouldn't have run away. Your friend would still be alive. It's your fault. - [Cecile] You bastards! - Look. Look. (light fixtures creaking) Sleep. Sleep. (uptempo jazz music) - Wait here, sergeant. I'll go in alone. Give me five minutes. Don't shoot 'til I tell you. (buzzer buzzing) (door creaking) - [Inspector Garcia] Mr. Morales? - [Mr. Morales] That's right, Inspector Garcia. Come in. - Don't make any noise, men. Come on. - [Inspector Garcia] I'd like to have a few words with you. A mere formality. Fire! - Open fire! - No! (guns firing) No! (birds chirping) (Cecile screaming) - You better talk. Better tell us who you're working for. - For Irina Forbes and her husband. - Darling, you have no idea what your body's gonna look like by the time we're through with it. You can't imagine what you're letting yourself in for. - You bitches won't make me talk, no matter what you do. Motherfuckers. - You think we're motherfuckers? - Yes, I think you're motherfuckers. (Cecile screaming) - We like our cigarettes to have a slight taste of burnt flesh. When you're tired of screaming, maybe you'll talk. - [Kidnapper] She's getting me all excited. Screams do something to me. - Now stop. That'll do for the time being. Spare her. (slow jazz music) Look what they've done to you. Putting such nasty, ugly scars on such a nice little body. They're really out to hurt you. Poor little girl, look at you. You can relax now. - [Cecile] Relax? - Yes, don't be afraid anymore. I'm here now, they're gone. I won't hurt you. Yes, you can relax. Relax... Relax... Look. Look at my ring. That's it. I'm sure you're feeling better, and the pain is going. - [Cecile] Yes, I'm feeling better, the pain is going. (car horn honking) - Hey, come out! All of you, come out! - [Hippie] What's happening? - [Hippie] Hey, it's Brother Milton. - Come on out! I need you, come on out! (car horn honking) - [Hippie] Hey, what's the panic? - [Mac] You crazy or something? - I gotta talk to you, everybody. The Flamingo guys got Cecile! They'll kill her! Can't go to the cops, can't trust them. There's nobody who can save her but you! - Let's go. Wait, I'll go get Ann Rosalyn. (uptempo jazz music) - [Female Hippie] Hey Jake, wait! - [Jake] Oh, get on. - [Female Hippie] Wait for me, Tony! - I got Ann Rosalyn! - I haven't seen you that excited in a long time. Why didn't you stay with her down there? I know you don't love me. Why are you staying? Because I'm rich? When I look at you, I know why I became your slave, though you don't care for me, and haven't for years. But slaves rebel, and I have. Now... I desire you, I don't love you anymore. Yes, I still want you. I see you are eminently fuckable. I used to be unimaginably in love with you. Now, well, it's something else. Perhaps you're worried that I may leave you. I won't. But you make up your mind right now, girl. I'm asking you for the last time. I'm buying an island with the money we made from this deal. I've had it being an errand boy, for whoever grabs power in this country. We'll live alone, just you and me. We deserve each other. And I won't let you go, ever again. It'll be you and me and nobody else, except some native girls you'll find on the island, to satisfy your whims and tastes, since I do not suffice. That's my proposition. Whatever your game is, might as well stop it. (Irina moaning) One thing is sure, as much as you still excite me, and you do, I'll never again be at your beck and call. (Irina moaning) Yes, I want you. But, I'll never be your slave. Those days are over. Now, when I ask you to be mine, if you think you can live this way, we'll stay together, forever. You know what forever means? It means you and me, forever. Do you accept that? Do you think you can become, let's say, a normal woman? I wonder, and that's why I'm leaving you the choice. (Irina moaning) (birds chirping) (Irina moaning) (Cecile screaming) (uptempo jazz music) - You're gonna tell us all you know. - [Kidnapper] You're gonna talk. - If you do, I'll stop. - [Cecile] I don't know nothing. - You are one hell of a tough bitch. - I don't know anything. I swear, I don't know anything. - Don't think you won't talk. Just wait. - [Kidnapper] We've got some nice things in store for you. - [Kidnapper] Shame. Such a beautiful body. Soft skin, nice to caress. (Cecile screaming) We don't use your fine, sophisticated torture. We just hurt, that's all. If it's a man, you just hit him on the balls for a while before cuttin' 'em off. And if it's a woman, we just slit her snatch and pour on vinegar. - And salt. - [Kidnapper] Salt hurts. Yes, my darling, it hurts. All right, here it goes. (hippies yelling) - Here, here, over here! - It's here! - There must be hundreds of them! Let's get out of here! (Cecile gasping) - Nothing... - That's it! Come on, where are the others? Fan out! Search every door in the house! (hippies yelling) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Hippie] You go over there! She's headed out that way! You go this way, come on! (gun firing) (rifle firing) (hippies yelling) (rifle firing) - No! (hippies and kidnappers yelling) (Irina screaming) (helicopter exploding) - [Hippie] Milton, we found her! - [Milton] Cecile! Cecile, my love! - [Cecile] Police Chief Pat Obania said today an international kidnapping network has been dismantled. The man thought to be the leader, Sam Morales, was fatally wounded while resisting policemen, who had come to arrest him. Imagine how those bastards deform the truth. - Let's get away from here, huh? I've had it. Look babe, you want to come with me? - [Cecile] You mean to the hotel? - Cut it out. They're mean cunts. Don't think they won't be looking for you. - [Cecile] I'll grow a beard. - You want to kill yourself? Go ahead. Oh, shit! (Cecile laughing) - As long as we can get away from all that. - So where do we go? - [Cecile] Where do you suggest? - I've got some money. It's not much really, but enough to buy me a small boutique. I'm good with a needle, so why not? I'll just pretend you're a boy. - You mean you intend to make an honest woman out of me? - [Milton] Too right. I'm tired of men. I want to try something new for a change. - [Cecile] Like marriage? - [Milton] Too right. (upbeat jazz music)
