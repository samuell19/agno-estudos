[crowd cheering] [Dave Mustaine] My victims are rich or poor, young or old, strong or weak. I cause millions of accidents, I am cancer in your bones. I fathered the lie, twist what you say, speak not the truth. I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes. I take what you love, and leave you in tears. I imprison your soul, your hopes are my games. I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain. While you burn at the stake, I dance with the flames. I bring poverty, sickness and death. A worthless handshake, the slickest thief, I steal your wealth. I answer your prayers for greed and lust. More than evil, I laugh at your trust. I am more powerful than all the armies of the world. I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death. I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars. I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath. ♪ Lost in a dream ♪ ♪ Nothing's what it seems ♪ ♪ Searching my head ♪ ♪ For the words that you said ♪ ♪ Tears filled my eyes ♪ ♪ As we said our last goodbyes ♪ ♪ This sad scene replays ♪ ♪ Of you walking away ♪ ♪ My body aches from mistakes ♪ ♪ Betrayed by lust ♪ ♪ We lied to each other so much ♪ ♪ That in nothing we trust ♪ ♪ Time and again ♪ ♪ She repeats let's be friends ♪ ♪ I smile and say yes ♪ ♪ Another truth bends ♪ ♪ I must confess ♪ ♪ I try to let go, but I know ♪ ♪ We'll never end till we're dust ♪ ♪ We lied to each other again ♪ ♪ But I wish I could trust ♪ ♪ My body aches from mistakes ♪ ♪ Betrayed by lust ♪ ♪ We lied to each other so much ♪ ♪ That in nothing we trust ♪ ♪ God, help me please, on my knees ♪ ♪ Betrayed by lust ♪ ♪ We lied to each other so much ♪ ♪ That in nothing we trust. ♪ ♪ How could this be happening to me? ♪ ♪ I'm lying when I say "Trust me". ♪ ♪ I can't believe this is true. ♪ ♪ Why does trust hurt? ♪ ♪ Trust equals suffering. ♪ ♪ My body aches from mistakes ♪ ♪ Betrayed by lust ♪ ♪ We lied to each other so much ♪ ♪ That in nothing we trust ♪ ♪ God, help me please, on my knees ♪ ♪ Betrayed by lust ♪ ♪ We lied to each other so much ♪ ♪ That in nothing we trust ♪ ♪ My body aches from mistakes ♪ ♪ Betrayed by lust ♪ ♪ We lied to each other so much ♪ ♪ We lied to each other so much ♪ ♪ Help me, please ♪ ♪ Betrayed by lust ♪ ♪ We lied to each other so much ♪ ♪ Absolutely nothing we trust. ♪ [crowd cheering] ♪ Welcome to our fortress tall ♪ ♪ I'll take some time to show you round ♪ ♪ Impossible to break these walls ♪ ♪ For you see the steel is much too strong ♪ ♪ Computer banks to rule the world ♪ ♪ Instruments to sight the stars ♪ ♪ Possibly I've seen too much ♪ ♪ Hangar 18, I know too much ♪ ♪ Foreign life forms inventory ♪ ♪ Suspended state of cryogenics ♪ ♪ Selective amnesia's the story ♪ ♪ Believed foretold but who'd suspect ♪ ♪ The military intelligence ♪ ♪ Two words combined that can't make sense ♪ ♪ Possibly I've seen too much ♪ ♪ Hangar 18, I know too much. ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ Jail break and a smoking gun ♪ ♪ You won't believe the things I've done ♪ ♪ And the killing is just for fun ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ A stolen car and I'm on the run ♪ ♪ Through the night till the rising sun ♪ ♪ And the trouble has just begun ♪ ♪ Roses on your grave ♪ ♪ I'll be on my way ♪ ♪ There's no time to stay ♪ ♪ With the enemies I've made ♪ ♪ I'm invincible ♪ ♪ You might say despicable ♪ ♪ Punishment's reciprocal ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ I'm unbeatable ♪ ♪ My mind is untreatable ♪ ♪ Crimes unrepeatable ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ Watch the authorities come undone ♪ ♪ With every stand-off that I've won ♪ ♪ Flirting death is just for fun ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ Born a fugitive father's son ♪ ♪ Another heist of a bank is done ♪ ♪ And the trouble has just begun ♪ ♪ Roses on your grave ♪ ♪ I'll be on my way ♪ ♪ There's no time to stay ♪ ♪ With the enemies I've made ♪ ♪ I'm invincible ♪ ♪ You might say despicable ♪ ♪ Punishment's reciprocal ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ I'm unbeatable ♪ ♪ My mind is untreatable ♪ ♪ Crimes unrepeatable ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ The posters say I'm wanted ♪ ♪ "Dead or Dead" ♪ ♪ Anyone who's tried ♪ ♪ Got a bullet to the head ♪ ♪ I'm invincible ♪ ♪ You might say despicable ♪ ♪ Punishment's reciprocal ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ I'm unbeatable ♪ ♪ My mind is untreatable ♪ ♪ Crimes unrepeatable ♪ ♪ Public enemy number one ♪ ♪ Public enemy ♪ ♪ Public enemy ♪ ♪ Public enemy ♪ ♪ Public enemy. ♪ [crowd cheering] Yeah.
