Nastya! How come you aren't in bed? I'll go to bed in a second. Is it true that... the leaves sound just like the sea? Well, yes... it's similar. Especially when it's windy. Nastya... - Yes? Did you decide? Yes or no? I haven't decided yet. Not yet... - What do you mean, not yet? Anya, Nastya, girls, stop babbling. Let us sleep. Enough already. Fine. We'll talk in the morning. Are you going to Communion tomorrow? Yes, of course. Anna. Blessed be God's servant, Anna, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Ekaterina. Blessed be God's servant, Ekaterina, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Anna. Blessed be God's servant, Anna, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Anastasia. Blessed be God's servant, Anastasia, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Thank you. Nastya Ignateva, after breakfast, you're to go to Ludmilla Petrovna's. Understand? Yes, fine. They were asking for you already, earlier. Ludmilla herself was here, looking for you. Oh... Hold on a second. Nastya... Here. Sit down for a minute. Yes, yes, yes. The regional boarding school for visually impaired women. Associated with the convent for women, The Holy... Yes, yes, yes. Correct. Equal-to-apostles. No, no, no. We're an independent decision-maker. The convent only provides us with a procession. And the building as well. It belongs to them, but they also need a renovation done. There shouldn't be any problems. Yes, thank you very much. I'll be waiting for the document to arrive. Nastiush... Well? What have you decided? Nastiush, it's Tuesday already. This can't be postponed any longer. Why aren't you speaking? I don't know, Ludmilla Petrovna. I don't understand what I should do. How can you possibly not understand? Fine. Let's talk about this calmly, without nerves. You need to have an operation done in Germany, right? - Uh huh. - Uh huh... And you have money for the treatment? No, of course not. How could I? How could you... And what has the commission's doctor told you? Do you remember? Another 12-18 months and it'll be too late for an operation, right? Now tell me, what don't you understand here? People are offering you money. For the operation... What don't you understand here, Nastya?! But there are conditions. Why? I don't know this person. He's keeping his identity secret. Why? Is that any way for a woman to get married? Nastinka, do you know what rich people are like? People of this caliber? You can't just approach men like him. He doesn't simply go to places. He's got assistants... lawyers... Ten different people. Millions of beautiful girls want to be married to an oligarch, but it doesn't work out for them. But I've never dreamt of anything like that. If he wants to do a good deed, God will repay him. - Nastya! - Why would he impose conditions? Nastenka, so he fell in love with you. It happens. A prince on a white horse showed up for you, girl! And you're turning your nose up at him! Understand this, this is your last chance to regain your sight. A real chance. I was going to apply as a novice nun at the convent... What?! Nastya, you're 18 years old. Do you understand that? You've got your whole life in front of you, you haven't seen anything yet. You haven't seen your own life yet. And you want to lock yourself up between four falls? Is that so? Nastya, come to your senses! But on the other hand... What if it's... What if it's... fate. Nastya... What if it's God. Maybe He's... sending you a miracle? And you're refusing him? That's a sin. Do you think so? I'm sure of it. Nastiushenka, everything is going to work out for you. Everything is going to work out. Just don't... Just don't get upset. Okay, Nastya? Don't get upset and everything will turn out great. The most important thing is not to do anything stupid, girl. Because if you say no to an opportunity like this one, you'll spend the rest of your life regretting it. Can I think about it a little bit more? Just until morning? Fine. Until morning then. Right? I understand... [???] Amen! Come in, Nastya. Have a seat. Have a seat, here. There are cookies here. Have some. Have you been to the ceremony today? - Yes, I took communion. - I congratulate you. Have some cookies, have some. And I've been to the late service. Can't seem to shake this disease. Well? Have you made a decision? No... Not yet... The headmistress gave me until morning to think about it. I asked her to. She must've decided that you're afraid to admit to yourself that you want it. Maybe... Probably... Everything I could've said to you, Nastya, I already said. I'm only a sinner myself, I could of course be wrong. But if that's the case, I'll tell you one more thing. God knows, I didn't want to say this to you. But it seems that I have to. Praise God. Ten years ago... You may not remember this. Pelagia, an eldress of the church from Siberia, arrived for a visit at our abbey. I was with her at the temple, and suddenly she said to me: "Well, Serafima, you have great power over the sisters, and you'll have it for many years to come. But you need to decide immediately who it is that you're going to appoint as your successor, who it is you'll be grooming for this role." And I said to her: "Pelagia, I think it's too early for me to be looking for a successor." And she says to me: "Not at all. There's your successor, standing right in front of us. The one taking communion... she'll be your successor as abbess." I said to her: "Pelagia, this girl is unable to see." I thought that perhaps she hadn't noticed. "I see that she's sightless," answered Pelagia. "But she has abilities that few people are blessed with. An inner gaze... There stands a sprout, blessed by God himself. God save her." Yes, those were her exact words. A sprout, blessed by God himself. You were 8 years old at the time. That's that, Nastya. Now you know. Yesterday I spent a long time thinking of this. Truly, the Lord granted you a special kind of destiny. You grew up in the abbey. A life of chastity, far away from the world. At 18 you decided to become a novice nun. And then you could've taken your final vows, and become a bride of Christ. But look what happened next. The moment you made the decision immediately, literally the next day, a temptation appeared. And what a temptation. The gift of sight, riches beyond anyone's dreams... All the world's pleasures, but only if you leave the abbey. Well? Isn't that a little strange? Why does it have to be a temptation? It might be God granting me a miracle, a miraculous cure. Can't a man simply fall in love? Marriage is sanctified by the church. You see how started talking all of the sudden? You already made up your mind, didn't you? What's the sense in talking then? Talking is useless. I don't want to be a blind cripple anymore! I don't want to! One can celebrate the Lord with seeing eyes as well. Of course one can, Nastya. But your path is a different path. You can be like the Moscow matron, saintly and just. She had her own path, I'll have my own. Yes, of course. You'll have your own. Well then... Go in peace. To bless you and your decision, that I won't do. My heart isn't in it. But I'll bless your journey there. And I'll be praying for you, both me and the sisters. That I promise you. Well then... May God protect you. Go on then. Go with God. Don't forget us. "CAUTION, DOOR" Nastenka... Hello, sweetie. - Hello. - It's great that you came. A lot of new books arrived. The list is right in front of you. Go on, read it. By the way, I put something aside for you. There... "Great Novels of the 20th Century". Read by Gerassimov. Length is 12 hours. That's not a lot, right? Would you like to listen to it? Actually, I wanted to listen to "Scarlet Sails". But you already listened to it just recently. I'd like to do it again. Fine. Here's the book. The headphones. Go on, have a seat. Wait a minute! Wait... Give me your hand. Here, take this sandwich. - No, no... I'm not hungry. - Take it, I tell you. I know how badly the boarding school feeds you, you're always going around hungry. - Thank you... - Go on now! How come you're up? But you've already made a decision. What's wrong? Anya... I think I know who the man is! Really? Yes... Remember last year when we had a male-female choir? And students arrived from all over? I remember that a boy was standing right next to me. Such a funny boy... For some reason he took my hand and pressed it against his face. I don't know, maybe he wanted to get to know me. But I remember his face. I even practically saw it with my own eyes. Boys, can you please take your places over there. In the third row. These boys are from the high school. They're going to sing with us at the concert. Again, from the top, please. Just the first row. Do these rehearsals usually take a long time? I have to leave at 3 o'clock. It's 2 o'clock now. Give me your hand. My name is Andrei. That's my benefactor. Who else could it be? Anya... Could it really be fate? I consent! I consent... You can simply call me "Marina". No need to call me by my patronymic. I'm Mikhail Alexandrovich's assistant and secretary. And by the way, Nastya... I'll keep the marriage contract for the time being. If you have no objection. As soon as Mikhail Alexandrovich signs it, I'll immediately return it to you. - Would that be okay? - Yes... Of course... We'll soon be arriving at the airport. We'll be flying on Mikhail Alexandrovich's private plane. Can I give you a hand? No, thank you, we'll manage by ourselves. We're going up the stairs. Raise your arm like so. - Are we in the air already? - No, what's the matter with you. I'll tell you when. Galya... Please make me a cup of coffee the way I take it. Of course. Here we go. We're taking off now. - Can you feel it? - Yes, yes. I feel it. Can you see us well? Can you see us well? Yes... Yes... Don't rush. Carefully... Easy... Easy. Go ahead. We're going straight ahead. Everything is alright. Carefully... This is your face. Everything is different. The world isn't at all how I imagined it. How did you imagine it would be? I don't know how to express it. Different... Oh! What is it? Would you like to take a look? Yes... Let's go. What's wrong? Are you anxious? A little... Everything is as if it was in a dream. Come on then. Come on. Hand me your coat. Go on. Go to him. Go on, don't be afraid. Forgive me. It's my head... It happens sometime. Well? Here we are meeting each other. I suggest... that we have a drink. To you. To... this momentous day of your life. Of our lives. To your coronation. Coronation? Of course. A coronation. What else could it be? I'm obviously a tsar. At least in this world, I'm a tsar. One tsar among many, of course. But still. And if I'm a tsar, then who might you be? A tsaritsa. And if you're a tsaritsa, then all of this is your coronation. Come on, let's drink to you. It sounds so strange... tsar, coronation... Strange? Not at all. Why is it strange? Look here... I have my own domain. A royal court. I even have slaves. What's the difference between me and a tsar? Nothing has changed. This is the way it's always been. This little counting rhyme. Power, money. Money, power. Money is more important nowadays. You can buy power with it. What's the Latin phrase? I don't remember it off the top of my head. Money decides everything. That's how it is. But you can of course feel it in your heart that it shouldn't be like that. What do you mean? What are you talking about? That money decides everything... It shouldn't by verity be this way. "By verity"... Well said. So it shouldn't be this way. No. But that's how the world works, little girl. Then the way it works is wrong. God can't be served through Mammon. So it is said. That's true. And this is why everyone serves Mammon, and not God. And about the world... Right? Wrong? I'll tell you this: Our world... is a rather filthy place. A very filthy place. But if you and me somehow found ourselves in it, then it's better to be a tsar, instead of... God knows who. Come on... Let's have a drink. Tell me, please... why me? Why have you picked me of all people? We've never even met. You've never seen me. And suddenly, out of the blue... You know, all of this happened out of the blue. To tell you the truth... A month ago, I visited your town on business. There was a contract there, a lucrative one. And this contract had something to do with your governor. And this governor of yours is a kind of a... overly religious man. I usually, to tell the truth, never go to church. Never... But what can one do, I had to go. So I'm standing around, and there's a choir. And I look, and there's something strange with the choir. These girls, sort of... with these little glasses. As if they're blind. Visually impai... You see what I'm saying... And suddenly I see... the solo vocalist. Standing there... And I'm right next to her, and I... A petite girl... This... This slender reed of a girl. A slim neck... You can see the veins through the skin. And this voice, so... And I... well... Simply an angel, you know... But a blind one. Don't get me wrong, I'm not usually a sentimental man. This is... All of this... But something here is... You see, I'm standing there... And... well... And the nerve in my cheek starts twitching. My throat is dry... I went outside, started pacing back and forth. Breathing, breathing, breathing... And it's not going anywhere. This angel. Standing there, standing right next to you. And it doesn't disappear. Almost as if it's looking at you. Nastya... It's okay... Let's talk first. Would you like that? Yes? Do you generally... know how this works? Well... Arousal... Sex... You know? Some girls at the boarding school were talking... - Girls were talking? - Yes. I heard... Has anyone ever touched you? What? - Ever... fingered you? - Never, sir! You're calling me "sir" again. We've talked about this. What's wrong with you? Forgive me... I can't... It's okay. It's okay, stop it. I can't do it. Fine... Fine... Come on. It makes it more interesting. Tell me. Can you imagine how you'd like to do it? Everyone needs it done differently. Everyone gets aroused by a different thing. You understand? How would you like to do it? - Yes... I know how. - You do? Go on then. Tell me. With the fingertips. The fingertips... Well, go on. Do it. Show me how. This is how. Like that. That's it? That's it... Okay, come on. Get up. Just get up. Come on. The nightgown. Take off your nightgown. - All the way? - All the way. Take it off... Don't do that, don't do that. Like that. Does that feel good? - Tell me, does that feel good? - I don't know. And like that? Does that feel good? Probably... Are you going to do what I tell you? - If it's necessary, I'll learn. - It is, it is. Spread your legs. Listen to me. Does that feel good? You're squirming, that's a sign that we're doing it right. It means there's a beast in you. - A powerful beast. - What kind of a beast? What kind of a beast. A beast in a cage. Like that, is that good? Tell me. I can feel it myself, that it makes you feel good. Necessary, necessary, necessary. Now you by yourself... - will release that damn beast. - I'm so afraid! - Come on, come on, by yourself! - So afraid! And me! And me! And me! Do you want it? Say it! You want it? - Yes! - Yes? One! Two! Three! Nastya, where are my...? Oh, there they are. Well now... Shall we go get breakfast? Yes? What's wrong with you? What's going on? - I'm not well. - Not well? I don't know how to... What? Here... Not well... Not well how? As if I did something bad during the night. Something shameful. Hold on now... Why... it's sex. Just sex. Everyone does it. What are you on about... I feel like... As if it's somehow... shameful. The soul doesn't lie! Anyway... Let's go get breakfast. Listen to me, Nastya. Today, after we have lunch we'll drive out to my mansion. You'll spend some time there, find your bearings. And then, after that's done with. We'll put on... two weddings. One in Belladonsk, the other one in Moscow. Two weddings? But what for? What do you mean, what for? Belladonsk is where you're from. Everyone knows you there. There's probably already a legend they're putting together about you. As if you were Cinderella. Get it? And in Moscow... We just have to do Moscow. That's where... Mammon is. And fireworks. All kinds of celebrities. - Are you joking? - Why would I be joking. What is all this for? Don't be afraid. Why are you afraid of it? Eat, eat. Relax. The people want a spectacle. You understand? And they need to get it. Marina! Where are you both? What's going on? We're already late! Come on! Marina, Marina... There you go. Just as promised. From head to toe. I can't believe my eyes. Amazing... A real princess. Do you yourself like it? What? This is so chic. Well, well, well. [???] Fools get all the luck. But I'm no fool. That's what I mean. Well! Let's go! We're going to be late. Call Nikolai, tell him we're on our way. Yes, Nikolai. It's me. Yes, they left for the airport already. As scheduled. - My bill, please. - Yes, please. No, I'm going tomorrow, via Moscow. It's a regular flight. Yes, I have business there. This is the city center. By the way, there's a shop here that isn't bad at all. Products from Switzerland, Norway... I completely forgot to introduce you. This is... Nikolai, my chief of security. Nice to meet you, Anastasia Sergeevna. Any time anything is wrong, tell him immediately. Understand? Stepping out of the car. Anastasia Sergeevna. Mikhail Alexandrovich, congratulations! Thank you, thank you. You will introduce yourselves later. We're tired as dogs after a long journey. In this hall breakfast and dinner are usually served. There is a gym in the next room, if you'd like. Kitchen. Masseurs usually work out of this room. - Would you like to come in and see? - No, thank you. That way is a swimming pool. Mikhail Alexandrovich swims every morning, that's his daily routine. Here is your bedroom, Anastaia Sergeevna. Excuse me... Everything is in order. Lightbulbs were replaced yesterday. Bathroom, toilet. Yes, everything is in working order. The fireplace is fully functional. There's a bar inside the table. Water, spirits. Mikhail Alexandrovich's bedroom. Your things will be delivered shortly, don't worry about that. And if you need anything, just use that phone to dial my extension, number 3. Please get some rest, I won't disturb you. Good morning. Good morning. Sit down, have some breakfast. I already ate. Nastyenka, I of course don't have anything against that. You can get up even later than this. I wake up early. I was thinking... It wouldn't've been bad if we... Every morning... Take this, please. Why don't we, every morning, get together and... And do... Some kind of a family meeting? - Would you like to? - Yes. Even if you wouldn't consent to it, that's what we'd still do. Because in this house, everything gets decided by one man. Just like in this whole city, by the way. And it could very well be that I'll soon be making decisions for the entire country. It's this little idea I have. Well, I'll be off... And if you'd like to go anywhere, be sure to check in at security. They'll explain everything. I meant to just take a walk. To get acquainted with the city. No, no, no, Nastyenka. Taking walks is completely out of the question. Only by car, and only with a security detail. Understand? When you reach your destination, only then can you take a walk. Understand? That's that. Bye now. Look what we got ourselves into. Bad luck. Mikhail Alexandrovich, isn't that one of your productions? I said, is it yours? The production? Mine, mine. What a great idea. From the outside, looks like a regular train car. No one could ever guess what's really inside. You'd be better off if you didn't run your mouth so much. Sorry... Yes. Nina Petrovna. I forgot to tell you, or rather forgot to ask. What do we have regarding charitable work? Yes, of course we're not doing any. That goes without saying. Listen, why don't we set up a charitable fund? Yes, we do have someone who'll be doing the work. My spouse could be the head of the organization. Consider the issue resolved. Most importantly, expedite the paperwork so that everything is finished by the 15th. Well, do your best. Do your best... The issue is resolved. Get it done. Yes, good. I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting. Mikhail Alexandrovich, could you please get back in the car? We can't control this location. I don't like it here. Yes, yes. We'll go right away. We absolutely have to change our route. Hello. Would you like to be driven anywhere? Could you please tell me, are we close to the sea? The sea... Where exactly would you like to go? I don't really know. It's just that I've never seen the sea. I'll think of something. Anastasia Sergeevna... This way? Yes, right here. We're going up. Anastasia Sergeevna, please take these binoculars. I need to talk. I have to. What? Need to talk. So we'll have a talk, huh? I need to talk to someone during the night, you understand? Need to talk to someone, all the time. Such a strange thing, get used to it. I wake up, I'm in pain. Can't figure out where it hurts. I even went to see some doctor in Switzerland. Couldn't figure anything out. Said that it was a psychosis. Phantom pains. Lunatic. What lunatic? I can get assassinated any minute! Lunatic... They can take me out, you understand?! Quiet! Quiet! They can take me out, get it? You can't talk like that. All pain and suffering is from God. Wait, you. Divine pain? Maybe that's what it is. They're undermining me. They feel that my strength is leaving me. I'm not scared! It's others that are scared of me! Fuckers... They feel me walking. My steps, they feel them. I know they do! Things are hard for me... It's not about money! Power! Power! That's the thing! Why are you afraid? You have so many bodyguards. It doesn't have anything to do with bodyguards! So many had bodyguards and still got assassinated! Easy as pie! It's not about bodyguards! There... Wait... Wait... You know, I had this sign. Just like seeing a ghost. We're standing at a traffic light. And a gypsy woman suddenly walks over to the car. I've hated these gypsies since I was a kid! I was just a little kid! She knocked, I opened the window. And she grabbed me! Held me by the shoulder. That bitch! She grabs me and she tells me: "Misha! It's over! You're done, Misha!" Her breath stinks so bad! I got a chill, it was as if a smell straight from the grave! Smell... Misha, she says... Misha... How did she know my name? I don't understand it! Caress! Caress me! Go on, caress me! Oh... those fuckers... Like it is written in [???] [???] And so you will go on living, and suffering. Either that, or else become stronger. - What is your name? - Anastasia. Anastasia. Where to...? Oh... Nastya... You see? Don't worry, it's just a scratch. They killed the driver and two bodyguards. It was some shootout! Don't worry. Come here, come here. Listen... The gypsy was right. After all this, you'd believe in anything, huh? That's that. Does your arm hurt? So so... A little bit. It's tolerable. What's that you have? A prayer book for the blind? I just can't seem to get used to regular letters. Can't do it... You'll get used to it. You'll get used to it... Why is this such a long night? Just goes on and on... Never seems to end. You hear? There is in you... a beast as well. Isn't that so? It's there. The beast is there. - What kind of beast? - What do you mean what kind? Desire, lust. Everything about you is as it should be, little girl. Everything is normal. What are you saying? I don't understand. - You don't? - No. Did you forget how I layed you on your side? And you pulled your legs up. And started tearing at me and scratching me. Everything's okay with you, huh? Why are you saying these disgusting things to me? What disgusting things am I saying? It's nature. Your little beast, it's still small. Hasn't developed yet. And when it grows up, [???] With its face right in the puddle. This filth you're saying, it's the reason we pray to the Lord, so that our spirit is nurtured and our base nature is transformed. She's a philosopher! Transforming nature! Did many people transform their nature, huh? I'm not talking about old men, whose bits all dried up and fell off long ago, and can't do it anymore. I'm talking about the young, healthy ones. Just read what your monks wrote, huh? Read it! They keep repenting, confessing their sins. Calling themselves "sinners" and nothing ever changes! They torment themselves, starve themselves, torture themselves, but all for naught! Isn't that so? - No, it isn't! - No? They're trying to transform their base nature! And what do you even know about these monks, these holy men? You can't even cross yourself! And you condemn others! How can that be? You're so full of hate for me! That's such a turn on! Let me give you a kiss! You're turning me on! Come on! Let's make out! What's wrong with you? Don't be afraid, you! You could've killed me just now, huh? And for what? For me having a different opinion, that's all it is. That's human nature too, to kill the one who has a different opinion. That's that. - Horrible, the way you live. - Horrible... That's how our world works, little girl. Not our world, but your world. Mine? Really? No, generally speaking. Yours... - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. What's wrong with you? What's with the farm girl's dress? With all the things we bought for you. Where's all that? I'm going to church, for the service. Uh huh. I get it. If it's church, does that mean it has to be in a modest dress? And when it's life, then it can be in Versace. Perfectly logical. I wanted to ask you. Wanted... To ask... If the operation hadn't been successful, how would you have acted with me? Would you like me to be frank? Be frank. I would've sent you back to your boarding school. And that's it. Maybe given you a little bit of money. I have no use for an invalid. And nobody else has any use for one either. That's how the world works, little girl. Only the healthy, the strong, the young are needed. The defective ones... First of all, they themselves suffer. Secondly, they make others suffer. It's one problem after another. Why do you ask? Huh? I was just thinking. There's another thing. You said that you loved me. Right? Very much so. You know, there's a type of marriage. It's called a "white marriage". That's when people live together, are in love, but without intimate relations. Can't we do that? Those are some interesting people. Some kind of people they are. Interesting. Yeah... White marriage, you say... Relations... It hurts! Let me go! It hurts! You don't love me, do you? I love you, I do, but not like that! Not the way you want me to. Another woman would be crawling around on the floor, telling me she loves me, can't live without me. Lying to me. But you're not doing that. You only tell me the truth. Interesting... That's a very rare thing. You like it? This is a place of strength. This is where real power lies. Are you shivering? Are you cold or something? Yes, I'm cold. What a strange place. Strange how? Smells of blood. Smells of blood? Can't you sense it? What's with you? There's no power without some blood. That's the way it should be. That's the way life is. Let's go, let's go. We're late. Magnificent, simply magnificent. Well, like always. - Isn't it? - So chic. So tell me... How is your evening going? How? Everything's so chic here. All this Mammon. Most importantly, don't forget that all mainstream media will get... You know, it's very important to me that... Things will be colorful. And fatter... And more... Okay? You understand of course that it's important for me. Just like it is for you. Don't worry. Tell me... Where did you get the girl? Where did I get her? There. There... From the moon. She's by the way not from your planet, at all. Really... An alien! If you'd like, yes. Tell me the truth. Who is she to you? Your wife? - My widow. - What a frank answer. And considering your age, even more so. You men are such asses. Your Grisha as well? My Grisha even more so than anyone else. But that's between us. Hey there! Mikhail Alexandrovich... Hello. - I congratulate you. - Thank you. I hear you purchased two factories. One factory. Still pretty good. [???] order? Three shifts? Four shifts. You're quite a guy, Mikhail. I want to enter that field as well. All the money is in it now. That's just a fact. I'll get back to you. Hello. This song is about us, gentlemen. About our history with you, about life. Some will like it, some won't. Our reality is our destiny. Nothing else can be. Galya... Pour me a drink. So... In two weeks, we'll go to London. In a year, we'll be immigrating to England. That's what I decided. I'm not hearing any applause. What's wrong? Are you upset? Why are you upset? Didn't like me as a philanthropist? - No, I didn't. - "No, I didn't." What's wrong this time? No monks, my dear? That's not how one does good. Didn't you say yourself that the TV production cost more than the donations brought in? That's right. And now what? What are these people sacrificing? This is pocket change for them. They give more money than this in tips. If one has too much money he can give it to whoever needs it. Such an amount of money can save a man's life. Yes, it can. But what for? Why save a man's life? What do you mean? Nastya! Nastya! You're sick... How am I sick? How am I sick? Your soul is sick. It's horrible. You're beyond saving. Because you simply have no faith. You want me to be a common peasant, huh? I don't know. Maybe. I'll be praying for you. I pray every day. God willing, I'll save you with my prayers. Prayer makes everything possible, that's what the church fathers teach us. Fathers? A lunatic, that's what I am. Fathers... What fucking fathers! What fathers! Fathers... Teach us... Well? What do you have planned today? I don't know yet. Listen, the wedding planners will be arriving soon. To finalize things. I don't want you to leave. I want you to be here. What does it have to do with me? What do you mean, what? I can't make these decisions for you. Color of the dress. Design of the dress. Color of the carriage, whether matching the dress or not. These are very delicate decisions. What carriage? You and me, Cinderella, are going to be riding in a carriage. Drawn by four horses, white ones. And the governor will be meeting us with a gold key. Like Pinocchio. We've discussed this already! - Fine. - Everything was discussed. - Don't you remember? - Fine, fine. I'll be here. Why are you jumping all over me over every single word? Well... I see that you're becoming hard to talk to. That's not good. It's a bad sign. Now I lost my appetite. You put me in a bad mood. By the way... You... You know... Can you fly out to your hometown for a few days? Relatively early. To see your boarding school, your girlfriends. They haven't seen you like this yet. I can go? No reason why not. When can I go? I'm ready. Let's find out. Strange, everything is so different. But I remember all the turns. We should now turn right, I think. Exactly... To the right. Nastya! Nastyenka! Hi. It's Lyubov Petrovna. I'm Maria. Remember me? - Is that for me? - Of course it's for you. Let's go, let's go. Right through here. We're renovating, thanks to Mikhail Alexandrovich. Finally we can take care of things. They wanted to shut us down. Can you imagine? For safety code violations. What a miracle. You got a miracle, and Mikhail Alexandrovich gave us money. We'll put things in order. Right, girls? Let's go to my office. It was a fright, what it was like here before. The girls put out a whole spread. We'll sit down, celebrate the occasion. It's right here. Come in, walk right in. But where are the girls? Because of the renovation, they transferred them out. Would you like their address? You can drive there. You have a car, right? It's a 3-hour drive, not too bad. Oh... Over there, that's where your office is? And beyond it is a room where we used to live. - Can I? - By all means. I can't believe it, she remembers everything. PIEROGI AND CRUMPETS Thank you so much. Timok... Take a look, I think that's a good one. No, it won't be a good fit for us. [???] Do you like it? It's a song from our new album. Would you like to buy it? I say, it's a song from our new album. Like it? Young lady... Don't... Don't you feel well? Everything's fine. I just had a dizzy spell. Right. I get it. There's a good Turkish cafe right around here. Cures all illnesses. Shall we go? My treat. Well? Haven't you ever heard any of our songs? No. We're actually a pretty popular band. At least in our own town. You should come to our show. We have one every Saturday. The band's name is Everest. Do you write music? Not me. I write the lyrics, Sergei writes the music. The thing is that I'm about to start studying literature at a college in Moscow. I spend my nights writing. All kinds of things... The guys like it, they say... That I'm almost a genius. But why at night? Every writer needs to have his own thing. His own [???] And that's mine. Besides, many writers wrote during the night. "The hour of the wolf". What's that? That's what it's called when it's 4AM, "the hour of the wolf". It's the most mystical time. The night is over, the day didn't begin yet. I usually open the window, even if it's winter. It's so quiet out... And writing becomes easy. As if... someone is guiding your hand. Maybe that's really what's happening. Who? What do you mean, who? The muse. That's the second prerequisite to being a writer. Your own Beatrice. Your own eternal love, that both inspires, and... Do you have a muse? Me? I don't. Not yet, I think. Although... maybe now I do. And it's just that I... don't know it yet. There's no need to walk me any further. I'll go on on my own. Is someone waiting for you? Not at all, it's just that... I'll explain later, another time. Ah. So there'll be another time. - If you'd like. - I'd like. Me too. Then... Call me. Or let me call you. I'd rather call. When? I don't know. Wait... Would you like to go out with us tonight? Our whole gang will be at my place tonight. - We're having a big party. - What kind of party? Che Guevara's birthday. Today? We just decided that it's today. Will you come? I'll give you a call if I can make it. Hello. This is my office. This is where... Well... You know... Here is where... I create my masterpieces. On this desk? Right on this one, Mademoiselle. There's no other. This is... the very window that I open at 4AM. At the hour of the wolf. Through this window, dusk comes in. He and I have a chat until it's light out. Then he leaves and I remain alone. And go to bed. What a beautiful view. And so high up. It's the highest point in the whole city. Or almost. It's the 7th floor after all. It's so good here. As if I already lived here in the past. I have to go. So early? - I'll call. - When? When I can. Call today, at 4AM. - I'll try. - Wait. These are all my new songs. Yes? Yes? How great... What? Great that you called. Did you write anything? No. I was... just thinking. What about? About love. I read about it so much. There's so much written about it. Everything says that it's like... being struck by lightning. A flash, and that's it. And you become different. And everything is different. You know, I used to think that... it's poetic images, or something. Well, in short, literature. But it turns out that it isn't. It's all true. It's so huge... that you feel as if your heart is about to burst. Forgive me, it seems that I... I'm talking with too much pathos. No. I completely understand. It's true. As if... your heart is going to burst. Yes... Come over, right now. Please. I will. What do you want? I didn't want to wake you up. Why would you possibly need to wake me up? Did anything special happen? Well? Don't make a production out of it. Speak. You requested it yourself. Any time there's new information regarding Anastasia Sergeevna. Well? There's was a phone call at 4AM. Here's the printout. After the call she left. We don't know where she went. And she's not at the hotel room right now. Who is this? So far we only know that it's just some kid. 20 years old, works as a store clerk. We're looking into who his parents are. I activated our local contacts. Works in a store... A store... Some nun she is. Some nun... Nun schmun. Here's a surprise. Look at that, they're coming to meet us. Some surprise. What are you doing, standing there? Cinderella... I need... to talk to you. - Need to talk? - Yes. Let's go, let's go talk. No! Right now! - You mean here? - Yes... Let me go... Let me go. Let you go where? - Where? - No... In general... I'll give you all your money back. Everything you paid for. Every last cent. I'll pay everything back. Please. I'll get a job. Just let me go. Please, have mercy. God will repay you for your kindness. I just can't anymore. I can't be with you. I just can't. I love another man. Do you understand? I love another! Forgive me, I... Yes... Well here's a pickle. A new one. Right before the wedding, huh? Well, let's go and discuss things. Come, come. Hello there! What's our room number? As always, the presidential suite, Mikhail Sergeevich. - It hurts! - Presidential... That's our room... You scum! Scum! If you say anything like that to me ever again, I'll skin your hide, you bitch! Bitch! I'll be the one to decide how long you'll be with me! Five years! Ten! Get it? Until I get sick of you! Go! Bitch... Go! Go make yourself presentable, you bitch! So that tomorrow, you'll be as good as new! Fresh! So everyone will see how happy you are from the look on your face! So you'll be glowing! Your eyes shining! The ones I gave you! Scum! Ungrateful scum! Nikolai, yes. Doesn't matter, I'm already up. What time is it? Can it really be morning already? Okay, come on. Come up. Come up, I'll be right out. - Go ahead. - It's done. Had a drug overdose, fell out of a window. We have a report from the police and paramedics. Even came up with a couple of eyewitnesses. So everything's taken care of. Eyewitnesses? What kind? He used to open the window and sit on the sill. That's the kind of dumbass he was. The neighbors saw it all. So everything is clean. Clean... Clean... Okay, get going. Have you been sitting like this all night long? Didn't get any sleep at all? Let me go, please... In the name of Jesus Christ, I beg you. Let me go. That means you want to go to him. He's not around anymore. He's dead. Who? Your kid. He's dead. What was his name? Andrei or something? How... Just like that. It turns out that he was a junkie. An overdose. Fell out of a window. The poor boy, what a tragedy. But what can you do. An accident. It was you... who killed him. No. I didn't. You're the one who killed him. Remember that. - Me? - Uh huh. Get me a water. Mikhail Alexandrovich... Would you like it still or sparkling? Doesn't matter. - I'll get you a glass. - Don't need one. Don't you feel well, Mikhail Alexandrovich? Not well... Not well... Don't you feel it? There's something hanging in the air. Something bad. Something's happening. You don't happen to feel it? That? Magnetic storms. They were talking about them on TV. Storms... Yes, maybe it's the storms. Maybe. You like the Tsar? What's your name? Vasily. And the Tsar... I really do respect him. I think it's better when there's a Tsar and... I get it. And you go to church, right? Every once in a while. Rarely, of course. That's the way to do it, rarely. Nothing to do in church. It's not God that you need. But a Tsar. Only not that one, but a different one. I cut out this clipping. From a magazine. A poem. "Who is he, the people's peacemaker? Dark, and angry, and ferocious A monk, at the monastery's doorway Saw him - and went blind He to unknown abysses Chases men, like driving herds Chases them with an iron staff Dear God! We run from judgement!" Run... From judgement... I need Mikhail Alexandrovich. Mikhail Alexandrovich, everything is ready. Please excuse me if I'm distracting you. But the governor's people called. He arrived at the palace already. May we begin? Excuse me. Nastya? Nastya? Where are y... Where are you? Everyone's waiting for you downstairs. How come you're not coming down? Nastya! Nastya... Where are you? Nastya! What's going on! Why aren't you saying anything? Nastya! Nastya! Hurts... So much... Hurts... So much... Straight ahead.
