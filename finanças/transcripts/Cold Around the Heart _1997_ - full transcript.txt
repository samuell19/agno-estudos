WOMAN: I'll tell you what I know. Most of it, I was there for. Some of it's the way I heard later. The rest is just the way I figure it happened. -(motor roaring) -(siren) -He's gaining on us. -I'm flooring it! This motherfucker is gaining on us! I got it wide open. Ned, we're not gonna make it, are we? -Are we? -No. I don't want to go down like this. It's over, Jude. (horn honks) (tires squeal) Uhh! JUDE: Ned! WOMAN (on PA): Dr. Ugida to Cardiology. Dr. Ugida to Cardiology. If you do go in, don't be too long. Jesus, you look like shit. I mean, no offense. You really look bad. I heard they dumped you on the road, I figured, "All right, so you got fucked up," but you look like shit. Who are you? Habbish, your lawyer, court-appointed. You know, if you don't have or can't afford, then one will be appointed for you. Well, I'm the one. Is that swelling gonna go down? -Leave. -Leave? What? Are you kidding? Representing you makes me a celebrity by association. This is a small town, Mr. Tash, and you're the biggest thing to happen around here since old lady Washington went crazy, stripped naked, and spent 45 minutes on her roof singing, "Daddy, Don't You Walk So Fast," and that was what? That was like back in, uh... I don't know, like '80, '83. -Are you gonna eat that Jell-O? -What do you want? Well, you got a hearing scheduled, so we gotta figure out how you want to plea. I didn't do anything. Well, there are three dead bodies that will say otherwise. I didn't kill those people. Look, when we go to court, you can lie to the judge, the jury, Buddha, God, your crystals, whatever you believe in, but I'm your lawyer. I'm the one that you tell the truth to, all right? That is if you're not too tired of living. So, why'd you do it? (train signal clangs) (train whistle blows) You know, I went down to the crime scene to have a look around. I was fascinated. Like I said, this kind of thing just doesn't happen around here. So, anyway, so I'm down there, you know. I'm looking around, and after I get done vomiting, I ask myself, "What kind of a sick fuck gets involved with something like this?" You know, the jewelry, that I can understand, but the rest, what was it, Tash? What makes a man go so wrong? (Jude moaning) -(laughing) -(high-pitched squealing) Oh, come on. Come on now. What? -I was just thinking. -What? What if God and Jeannie got in a fight? Who? You know the genie from I Dream of Jeannie? What if she got in a fight with God. Isn't that funny? Isn't that funny? -What? -You motherfucker. (sighs) You're doing it again, Jude. -What? -You're laughing in bed. Oh, I wasn't laughing at you. You weren't thinking about me. Of course I was thinking of you. I'm always thinking of you. Sometimes my head is so full of you I think the only way to empty it is by killing myself. You want to hear something funny? You want to hear something funny? You and me together, that's funny. Jesus, I was just kidding. Relax a little, would you? You are-- you are so tense. Let's do it again. Shit. No. JUDE: One more time? I want it to be perfect. (sighs) Hit the shop at 2:30, slowest part of the day, only three employees, smash and grab, gives the cops only three minutes to respond. No security cameras, no fancy alarms. (chuckles) Small towns... These people would smile at you while you're stealing their teeth, and they'll point out the ones you missed. We take what we want, and we head back west. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. No back west. The most depressing year of my life. -I'm not going back there. -We have to. There's a guy there that can fence this stuff for us. It's not like moving color TVs. You know, there's only a handful of guys in this part of the country that can handle what we're bringing in. You made it there a year. You can stand it-- -It's gonna rain tomorrow. -It will not rain! It's going to fucking rain tomorrow! I'm not doing a job in the rain. Too many things can go wrong, so put it out of your mind. And we should do what instead? Whatever we want. We've got the money. -It's not enough. -We've got enough to get started. Everything that we've talked about, we have enough money. And then what? Find what? Some job? Punch a clock? Do my eight and go home to four gray walls? Ha! No, thanks. I've tried that. It's too slow. Ned, $250,000, that's what we're talking about, a quarter of a million sitting no place-- NED: And then? That's it, right? The end. JUDE (overlapping): $250,000. Nothing will go wrong. After this, we walk away for good. -That's it, right? The end. -Do this for me. JUDE: It's once in a lifetime. Just you and me, straight down the line. Well, let's do it one more time. HABBISH: She's no good. Rotten like garbage in July. -Mm-hm. I know. -Mmm. Well, now, but not then. No. I knew she was no good then, too. It didn't matter. I left Brice to be with Jude. -Brice? -My ex. She put a bullet in Jude's leg as a going-away present. We're tied together like that. Jude is smart, tough, good in bed. Great in bed. And good with a gun. A woman like that is just about perfect. Sure, and why give her up just 'cause she's crazy? -How bad is it? -Armed robbery, triple homicide. Hell, getting dumped on the highway probably violates three traffic laws. You'll get the death penalty. I figure you got, what? Eight years to live. Thank God for appeals, huh? Anything else I can get you? A phone. A phone I can do. I don't know who you're calling, but unless it's God... ...I wouldn't waste the dime. (doorbell buzzes) (buzz) (clanking) (resumes buzzing doorbell) You want something? Johnny Costello-- he around? Johnny Coke Bottles? No. He ain't here. I-- I was supposed to meet him. I guess it don't matter. He ain't here. What time will he be back? Four days. I don't know, maybe five. Days? What do you mean, days? I was supposed to meet him today, now. Yeah. You said. I said he ain't here! Where the hell did he go? Look, I ain't his fucking secretary! God! I gave him a sedative. He'll sleep for a while. (chatter on PA) (door closes) GUARD: Open the door! Damn you, Tash! What are you doing? Open this door! Uhh! It's in the back, so it's quiet. You've got your privacy. That's the bedroom. Clean. But you can see that. Got a kitchenette. Clean, too. I don't rent a hole in a wall. Most people rent their rooms out cheap wouldn't take care of them. Just 'cause they're cheap don't mean they can't-- I'll take it. How long do you want it for? Five days most. If I'm lucky, not even. Charge by the week. You can stay five, but you gotta pay for seven. In advance. Thank you, sir. You'll not soon regret it. That is a real fine car. Nobody builds them like Ford, doesn't matter what year. Real fine. Built Ford tough. Happy driving. Okay. You got out-of-state papers? Mm-hm. (chuckles) Ned. (brakes squeal) NED: Where you heading? West. Just west. Get in. Girl like you shouldn't be hitching rides. You never know what... Drive. ...what kind of people you're gonna meet. Where to? Just put your hands on the wheel and move. You're the boss. -(buzz) -MAN: Yeah? I'm looking for Coke Bottles. Who wants him? Jude. (lock buzzes) MAN: Well, lookit here. What's a fine piece of work like you doin' in a place like this? That's cute. Did you come up with that shit yourself, or did you steal it from a greeting card? That's my own special brand of talk. Like it? Make you hot? Yeah. I'm having an orgasm as we speak. Where the hell you been? I've been here every day for the last five looking for you. I don't suppose it's because I'm the love of your life and you want to get with me? I could lie if it would make you feel better. And I bet you could make me believe it, too. Not that I'm not enjoying this, but-- Ah, Johnny Coke Bottles. Nobody loves him till they got something hot to move. Good quality. Nice cuts. You picked a good assortment, too. Oh, yes, ma'am. These will get you top dollar. -And I won't touch them. -What? You need me to Helen-Keller it for you? I won't touch them. You just said they'd move at top-dollar. Three bodies back at the jewelry store, and every mother's son is looking for these pieces. They got blood all over them. Whoever gets caught passing these is gonna be looking at hard time. Coke Bottles don't have any hard time left in him. Yeah, really? Well, we had a deal. You're gonna fence these for me! Murder wasn't part of the deal, princess. Coke Bottles don't do murder. Now, you come back when those have cooled off. Maybe six months. Six months is too late. Now is when I need the money. (chuckles) Yeah. I'll bet you do. Yeah, I read the papers. You left your friend a short rope to hang by. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. Only he gets out from under the law. And I guess you figure the first thing he's gonna do is come gunning for you, and I'm guessing you figure right. Take your rocks and go, sweet cheeks. Come see me in six months. If you're still alive. Mm. Now, unless there's something else Coke Bottles can do for you... Well... Yeah, there is something that Coke Bottles can do for me. Coke Bottles can give me the fucking money. (gun cocks) Oh, that's my sister's boy, Everett. Dumb as a box of hair. Only good for two things: moving furniture and killing people. Put it down. Great. Now... Let's you and me talk about these jewels. Where are you going? Where are you going? -I gotta take a leak. -Keep driving! -I have got to take a leak. -Keep driving! We have been at this for a couple of hours now. I am tired and hungry, but I let that slide, okay? If you don't go now, I'm gonna kill you. Right now, I gotta take a leak. So if you're gonna shoot me, go ahead and shoot me. Because one way or another, I'm gonna take a leak. Don't get out of the fucking car, man! Come on. Hold it! Hold it! I'm serious! God damn it! Hold it! (sighs) Have you ever killed anybody before? Hmm? That's a pop gun. You're gonna have to get a lot closer than that. You're pointing at my chest. That's a .22. It hits like a bee sting. Point it at my head. (whimpers) Good. Now, pull the trigger. Pull the fucking trigger! (whimpers) See? No guts. (grunts, gasps) Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I didn't know it was loaded, man. I swear to God. I'm sorry. Well, it was loaded, wasn't it? (whimpers) It was loaded! (Tash urinates) And you are a stupid bitch. Wait, where you going? You can't just leave me here, man. I'm pregnant. Yeah? -(cries out) -Come here. What's this? Look at this. What's this, Mommy? You're not fucking pregnant. You're not pregnant. Come on, man. You can't just fucking leave me here. If you are coming, let's go! You got a name? Bec. Let me ask you a question, Bec. What would you do a stupid thing like going and pulling a gun on me for? (sighs) I don't know. I just-- Look, you're gonna have to stop crying and give me an answer. If you wanna stay in this car, you gotta stop crying. I don't know. I just-- you know, hitchhiking is dangerous, and, you know, I figured I should pull a gun before somebody else does. Pretty stupid move, though, huh? And this pregnancy thing. You think that was gonna fool anybody? Nobody would hurt a pregnant woman, right? No. I know men that would rape you because you were pregnant, and if you were blind and in church, it'd be better. Oh, fuck, man, you're not gonna hurt me, are you? I want to know what you're hitching rides for. I was running away. From what? -What do you care? -This is not about what I care. I'm asking you why you were hitching rides for. No. What do you care, okay? Okay. (tires screeching) -Get out. -Hey, man, this is the middle of nowhere. Get out! Come on, you cannot leave me here. Please, all right? Please don't leave me here. What were you hitchhiking for? Because my father is a drunk, and he beats me, okay? Every night he gets drunk. He comes home, and he beats me... Or, you know... Does he touch you? No, he doesn't touch me, man, he fucks me. He fucks me. -I'm sorry. -What are you sorry for? -Are you sorry you asked? -I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry. You know what it's like to be used. You don't know what it's like to be violated! No, I'm just sorry. I sympathize with your position. "I sympathize," yeah. What do you know? There's a-- there's a woman... ...out there that I pulled a job with. And she... pushed me from a speeding car in the middle of a highway to take the rap for three murders I didn't commit while she escapes with a quarter of a million dollars in jewels. WOMAN: All right. So you do know what it's like to get fucked. (register ringing) Let's go. Wait. I've never been anywhere, man. I wanna get pictures of everything. Then take a picture of me blowing out of here. You think I'm kidding? (revs engine) (camera clicks) There's a Coke in there for you, too, a sandwich, whatever you want. Where were you headed? I mean, you were running away. -Where were you headed? -(can pops open) I don't know. Anyplace, man. (voice echoing) Anyplace is better than where I've been, right? Yep. If you were running away, where would you go? I don't know. I'd go to Canada. -Canada? -I'd go to Canada. Why? Because I've been up there, and it's beautiful: wide open spaces, not a lot of people crowding you. You get free healthcare from the government, which is good. You've just got to be a citizen to get it. Oh, yeah? And how would you do that? The best way is to marry a Canadian. (chuckles) You would? -Yes, ma'am. -I, uh... I guess that wouldn't happen to me. -Why not? -Why would it? You're a pretty girl. Oh, yeah. Right. -Sure. -Yeah. So what happened when you robbed that jewelry store? -I was just curious. -Yeah. What happened. I don't know. I don't know what happened. I don't know, you know? It was going as planned, no problem. I was heading out the door, and then Jude-- That's the girl, your partner? -Yeah. -Jude? Yeah. That's Jude. Jude. Jude starts blasting. Three people in the store, kills them all. She didn't have to do that. She didn't have to do that. That brought the cops. We take off, they give chase. Next thing I know, I'm chewing on some asphalt while old Jude is tearing up the highway, a free woman. She just shot three people for no reason? I guess Jude doesn't need a reason. (sighs) So you're gonna go and find her? Yeah. I'm gonna find her. I don't care how long it takes. I'm gonna hunt her down and kill her. You must really like her, man. You must really like her. What? Well, I mean, that is not something you do because you hate a woman, you know, just because she did you wrong. You don't hunt the world for her. I know I never had anybody like me so much that they wanted to hunt me down. That's heavy. Well... Weird, man. (laughs) You are weird. -No, I'm not. -You're weird. You just like her. You like her a lot. Have a sandwich, would ya? (both laughing) (camera clicks, whirs) MAN: Hey, Tom, how you doing? Pick you up another .22? TOM: I was thinking about it. What's the deal with these? MAN: They call them cop killers, but they're good on squirrels, too. TOM: Thanks so much, Travis. TRAVIS: Y'all take care now. Bye-bye. Well, how are you this evening, miss? Good. Can I help you with anything? I want to buy a gun. Uh, hunting rifle? Shotgun? -Handgun? -Would this be for yourself? I, uh... lost mine. I don't feel safe without one. Handguns do make the best protection. Now, this here-- now, this is a very nice model. It's light. It's got a hair-trigger, which makes it easy for a lady to use. And it fits comfortably into a purse or handbag. Isn't that cute? Let me see this Smith & Wesson. Oh... (chuckles) Well, that's a big gun. I don't think you want a big gun. This here's a small gun. What are you, Captain Kangaroo? Smith & Wesson, please? Smith & Wesson, 15-round mag with one in the chamber. Semi-auto, double-action. I know. Nice. I'll take it and the Beretta. Well, now, you know there's a 20-day waiting period? Twenty days? It's the goddamn liberals, that what it is. It's the goddamn liberals. I can't wait 20 days. Well... there really isn't anything I can do about it. But I-- I just don't feel safe without a gun. I understand. Believe me, I do, but... Uh... Well, of course, rules were meant to be broken, huh? I think I'm gonna like it around here. (crickets chirring) ♪ I can't see me lovin' nobody but you ♪ ♪ For all my life ♪ Wake up. We're here. Wake up. Uncle Mike! Son of a bitch! Ned! I didn't think I'd be seeing you anytime soon. I heard what happened. Hell of a thing, getting caught like that. Hey, man, nice to see you. -Been too long. -Jesus, it's good to see you. -It's good to see you! -You, too, man. You, too. And who's this pretty thing? I'm Bec. It's nice to meet you, sir. Hi. Call me Uncle. We're all family here. Real nice. That's yours? No, she's not anybody's. She's just along for the ride. Ah, well, sure glad you made it through okay. I thought we lost you this time. Me, too. Well, come on in out of the dark. Come on, see if I can't fix you some, uh... I think I got some chili might still be good. (chatter on TV) -Be careful now. -(laughs) There. Spoon that in you and see how it makes you feel. MIKE: Heavenly father, bless this bountiful feast we are about to receive for which we are forever thankful. Bless those, too, who are not here today to share our tidings. Keep them until we may be with them. We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Oh, hey, Ned. I got something for you. Might need that down the road. Thanks, Mike. -Hey, Mike. -(gun clicks) Are you really Ned's uncle? (both laughing) Oh, no. No, I just-- I know him and Jude from way back. I met them in a doughnut shop in Albuquerque. Santa Fe. Santa Fe. We're having some crullers and coffee when them two walk in and decide to rob the place. -NED: Jude's idea. -Well, whoever. They pulled their guns, and they started acting -like a low rent Bonnie and Clyde. -Shit. What happened? What do you think happened? They tried to rob a doughnut shop. They had more cops on them than a black man in Birmingham. (chuckles) Mike got us out. Oh, yeah? What'd you do? I felt bad for the kids. I know what it's like to be in over your head like that, so I pulled my piece and started blasting. Shot our way out. Was anybody hurt? Cop got killed. You killed a cop? I didn't say that. Cop got shot. There was a lot of lead flying. I think another cop shot him. MIKE: well, you know, I always said, ain't the wild west out there. Got to know the score going in. That's where Jude fucked you up. She shoots first, and she doesn't even bother asking questions. And you, you just go along, dragging your tongue in the dirt right behind her. Oh, boy. A lot of wise talk for an old man sitting on his ass out here alone, Mike. You weren't there. You don't know how we had it worked. Well, I know exactly how you worked it. Jude told me all about it. She was here, you know. Stopped on her way west. Bad call, Ned. Three people dead, and you left to take the fall. Once you thought with your head instead of your cock. You wouldn't let that girl sucker you in. It's the same as you let Brice sucker you along. Face it, Ned. Some men are born smart about women and some are born stupid and.... ...you were born stupid. Love you like a brother, Mike, but do yourself a favor. Never call me stupid again. (telephone rings) Yeah. Ned, did you really kill a cop? I told you what happened. I didn't kill anybody. Somebody did. Doesn't that bother you? Uh... we are not kids playing games here. This is real, and if you're going to hang with us, you better get with that real quick. Okay? Ned, it's for you. Hello. Hey, Ned. Hey. I figured you'd stop at Uncle Mike's. How are you? My head's a little sore, but I'm okay. How about you? I'm good. That dead cop got to you? It's just Ned doesn't seem like the type of person that would kill somebody. -Jude. -Yeah? I'm gonna kill you for this. Everybody's the killing kind. If it's their back against the wall, they'd pull the trigger, too. The only difference between Ned and most people is he's already had to do it. So what's it like, pulling a job? Is it fun, exciting? Only the amateurs do it for the jazz. See, a good job-- Oh, you gotta have it figured, every step of the way. You come up with 50 ways you could get caught, you're still short by 200. It's a skill, but that is the beauty of it. It's not the thrill of pulling a robbery, it's the satisfaction of a job well-done. Ned, it isn't like you think. You didn't leave me for the cops? What was I supposed to do? Who would it have helped if I'd gone down, too? But you-- you got it for him, don't you? Ned? Yeah. Have I got it for him? Maybe. Maybe. (chuckles) Your boyfriend would be awfully jealous if he could hear you. Yeah, my boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend. A pretty girl like you with no boy? No. That don't seem right. We could've been together. You don't want to be together? Would you have stayed for me? Three dead bodies and a sackful of jewels by your side? Would you have stayed? What's that, Ned? I didn't hear you. Where are you? Hmm? Jude, make it easy on yourself and tell me where you are. (sighs) Jude, I want you to listen to me very carefully now. I am going to find you and kill you. -Did you hear me? -Ned. I am going to find you and kill you. Yeah, operator, I need to make a long distance call. So what is she like? Jude? Mm-hm. Now, she got-- she got her good points. She's smart, good-looking, but dangerous, like a stray bullet. Women are no good to have around-- Oh, I shouldn't have said that in front of you, but that is the way it is. Women are nothing but trouble. And Jude is as bad as they come. I wouldn't turn my back on her if she was two-days dead. She couldn't be that bad. Ned wouldn't like her if she was. Maybe she wasn't always that way. Maybe she's just a good girl gone bad. She was born bad. Nobody had to teach her anything about it. That would be like giving a kangaroo hopping lessons. No, Jude did not go bad. She just got worse. MAN: What, that much for chicken? I can't believe it. Chicken. WOMAN: That's what it says. You see what it says, don't you? MAN: Yeah, right. Forget about that. Uh, I want... How much is a cheeseburger? Three seventy-five. How much is a regular burger? Three. All right. Give me a regular burger. You want fries with that? How much are fries? A buck extra. How much is a regular burger? Three. Three dollars. Same as when I told you before. -Just the burger. -Isn't that sad, Inez? What's that? A man who can't even buy fries to go with his burger. Yeah, look at me. My heart's busted. Man works hard for what he's got. A handful of fries is all he asks in return. Well, he can ask. We ain't giving them away. Politicians promise to keep the Mexicans out, cut taxes. Why don't they promise a man what he needs? Fries on his plate and a woman in his bed. Hey, fuck you, okay? Ooh, take a pill. We were just having some fun, weren't we, Inez? INEZ: Fun or no fun, we're not giving the fries away. Why don't you let me buy you a plate? Keep your money, lady. You're an awful hard guy for someone who can't even buy fries. Bring him a plate and throw some cheese on his burger. INEZ: Big spender. Order up! Burger and fries. Thanks. I appreciate that. INEZ: Cheese on it. Guess it took a little more money than I figured to get out here. I ran a little dry, you know? Can't help from getting hungry. (chuckles) Can't help getting a little lonely, either. -You mind if I sit down? -My boyfriend might. (scoffs) You got that in quick, didn't you? Relax. He's a ways away. What's your name? -T. -Tea? -As in and crumpets? -Huh? So what happened to the rest of your name, T? Oh, that's all my parents give me. What about you, you got a name? I'm sure my boyfriend's got a few for me. Most of the time he calls me Jude. Oh. Well, where is he anyway? Down around Tempe. Tempe? What's he doing there? Looking for me. (chuckles) Well, what did you do? I pissed him off. I have a habit of pissing men off. So, how do you fill your days, T? Or is it Mr. T? (chuckling) Ah, well, I used to work in a brewery in Milwaukee. -Till I got laid off. -Mm-hm. Uh, came down here looking for work. (sniffs) Read in a magazine this place is booming. Booming? Yeah. It's depressed as hell around here. Oh. It was an old magazine. Kind of slow, aren't you, T? I guess so. I'll give you this. You got a way of making dumb look good. Huh? Oh, ooh! Shh! I'm back. I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna get close to you, that's all. Hey, what are you doing that for? I said I wasn't gonna hurt ya. Just settle down, and you'll like it. NED: Mike! Come on! Get away from her, Mike. You shouldn't have done that, Ned. You really shouldn't have done that. (both grunting) (panting, coughing) No. -No. -Mike. -(gunshot) -(cries out) (gasping) Uhh! Shot with my own gun. Th-that's what hurts. I had to, Mike. You left me no choice. My own friend shoots me with my own gun. I knew having a girl around wasn't gonna be any good. She's got nothing to do with this, and you know it. I guess not. I'm sorry. I, uh... (sniffles) Uh, I didn't mean nothing by it. I just... I went crazy for a minute, you know? I think living by yourself... for so long... ...it makes ya forget your manners. I just went a little crazy. But... ...I'm okay now. Okay now. Uhh! Being gut-shot's a bad way to die. Slow. Oh, it hurts like a son of a bitch. And I don't wanna die gut-shot, Ned. Go call an ambulance. No, no! It's not like the city, Ned. It's... hospital is... It's more than an hour away. Meanwhile, I'll just be sitting here... ...dying. Ned... Y-you gotta do it. Don't let me die like this. -Ned... -Get your things. Go get your things. (gasps) Start the car. -Ned, please-- -Go outside. Start the car! Go! (turns radio on loud) [stammers] Mike... [rock music playing loud] No! Shit! I'm not even gonna ask you because I know you didn't shoot him. I know you called an ambulance. I don't wanna hear about it, okay? He was right about you. He was right about you. If I hadn't have brought you in there, this never would've happened. What am I supposed to say to that? You are not supposed to say anything. You're supposed to shut your mouth. I can't believe you shot him for me. I didn't shoot him for you. You have nothing to do with this. He left me no choice. You are not a part of this, so you don't need to talk about it. I couldn't have shot him for you. -If you had to, you would've, sweetheart. -No! -If you had to, you would've, sweetheart. -No! No! Is that what you're gonna do to Jude? Just gonna hunt her down and shoot her? If I have to. If I had to... ...I'd shoot you. (engine starts) (Jude moaning) (laughing) What? What's so funny? My Favorite Martian. You ever watch that show? (laughing) That's what you're laughing at? Jesus Christ. What? I'm in bed with you, and you're thinking about a goddamn TV show? You men and your weak, little egos. You know all about men, don't you? You know all about me. Not that there's much to know about, I admit that. You ain't such a hard read yourself, you know, about the kind of woman you are. Oh, really? What kind of woman is that? The kind of woman that's good-looking and knows it. You always had men falling all over you, haven't you, huh? Always gotten your way, huh? Should I be taking notes? No. That's it. 'Cept you're smart. (exhales) (sniffs) Smart enough to know someday those looks are gonna wear away, and you're gonna be all on your own, baby. Huh? I bet that scares you. Knock it off. Scares you to think you're gonna grow old and normal-looking just like the rest of us. And it scares you to think you're not gonna be able to get away with making fun of guys in diners just 'cause they wanna fuck ya. I never even thought about it. Sure, you have. Hardly ever. Not even for two or three minutes at a stretch. Guess there's really not much to me, is there? That's all I am, a good-looking lay? Aw, shit. (crying softly) Hey, what you doing? Well, shit, are you crying? Hey. Hey. Hey, man... I'm just talking, man. I don't mean nothing by that. I'm just fooling with ya. I'm crazy about you. God damn. I didn't mean nothing by that. (kiss) Huh? Huh? (chuckles) You're okay, T. You better get out of here while there's still time. What are you talking about? I'm dead. Don't you know that? How did you like fucking a dead girl? What? You--- you talking about that-- that boyfriend of yours? What, are you scared of him? He's coming for me. And when he finds me, he's gonna kill me. Why? He thinks I crossed him. Did you? No. Well, maybe you should talk to him. (scoffs) I tried. Talking's not what he wants. Maybe you and me could go away, you know? Like maybe we could, like, run away together. (soft chuckle) I've been running. I can't run far enough or fast enough. He's gonna find me. And when he does, he's gonna kill me. And if he finds you here, he'll probably kill you, too. (snorts) I'm not scared of him. I'm not leaving. I'm gonna stay with you. I'm gonna protect you. (laughs) You're gonna protect me? An out-of-work brewer who can't even buy his own fries? (laughs) I know you mean well, T, but you let one good fuck go straight to your head. Hey, I said I was gonna protect you, and I meant it. Would you? What would you do when he comes for me? What would you do, T? Would you kill him for me? Would you do that? -Here. -What? What am I supposed to do with this? You're supposed to shoot it at the crate. I don't know how to shoot that gun. I'm gonna teach you. Take it. Aim at the crate. No, no. You use one hand. Get used to firing with one hand, okay? It's quicker, and you have to learn how to take the kick. -Yeah. -Don't grip too tight. Can't be afraid of the gun. As long as you're on this side of it, she's your friend. Okay, she's my friend. Relax your arm. Hold it steady. Okay. -Straighten your sights? -Yeah. Slowly squeeze the trigger. Don't jerk it. Even pressure. Keep squeezing. Wait a minute. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. God damn it! You take it. I don't wanna shoot that gun. (gunshots) (casings hitting asphalt) It's that easy, T, like using a doorknob, except with a gun, someone gets dead. Jesus! Jesus Christ! Damn! You said you were gonna protect me. Yeah, I know, but I mean, come on! You said you wanted to stay with me, that we'd be together. Don't you wanna be together? Oh, baby, yeah. Hell, I wanna be together. I'm crazy about you. Someone is coming to kill me, T. What are you gonna do when he gets here, call him names until he busts out crying? I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do! (sighs) I never killed a man before. (sighs) Killing a man isn't something you work up to. All it takes is one good try. That'll be $19.35. How much further to 15? Couple hours if you drive steady. Ought to make it to town by nightfall. Thanks a lot. (couple arguing) What's that for? This is where you get off. Ned, you don't have to do this, man. -Let's just drive. -Drive where? To anywhere. Let's go to Canada, like you said. You know? We can go together. Not like there's anything between us or nothing. I'm just saying-- I have to find Jude. I have to find-- Forget about Jude, man! Leave-- Why can't you just leave her be? -It's too late. -What does she matter? -No. -It is too late. -It is not too late. -It is... -(sunglasses clattering) -...too late. Look... This is like a runaway train. Okay? It won't stop. It's moving too fast for me to get off. I gotta take it to the end of the line. But this is not right for you. Okay. Okay. (keys jingling) (click) Stand up, Ned. Stand up, or I swear to God, I'll shoot you where you are. Who the hell are you? (whispering) Don't move, Jude. -Put it down. -(gun clicks) Sorry to drop in on you unexpected like this, honey. JUDE: Oh, Ned, you're not unexpected. -Hey, T. -Hey, Ned. Thanks for keeping an eye on things for me. Wasn't nothin'. Wasn't nothin' at all. You son of a bitch! (grunting) Come here. (breathing heavily) (whispering) Fuck. Ouch. Ouch. I know how you think. I had you figured all the way, honey. She wanted me to kill you, man. What? You wanted me dead? Oh, it's not like that. I wanted some protection, but it's not like you think. Ned, I knew you were coming for me. I could've-- I could've run, but I stayed put. You knew I'd find you, right? I just wanted to talk things out. I never wanted anybody to get hurt. That's why I wanted some protection-- No good with the dancing, honey. Oh, fuck! It's the truth, Ned. It's the truth. (softly) Bye, Jude. -Ned-- -Do it, man. Do it. Yeah. Do it. Kill me. Oh, and you do... You'll never see those jewels again. (dry chuckle) That's what it's all about, isn't it? Isn't it? You sure know how to break a girl's heart. Ohh! And here I was thinking you came all this way for me. -Where are they? -Put that thing away. You look like a dime store cowboy. Fuck you, Jude. Where are they? Who gives a fuck about the jewels? Just shoot her! She wanted to shoot you, man! I say shoot her! Nobody cares what you say. Why don't you go take a couple of drop-dead pills? -Jude! -I don't have them. Coke Bottles ripped me off. I went to fence them... -To get money to get out of town. -To get rid of them. Heat's still on and I didn't want to get pinched carrying that stuff. Only Coke Bottles has another idea. -He pulls a gun and just takes what he wants. -You just let him. What was I supposed to do, go to the cops and tell them somebody just ripped off the jewels I stole? That's the chance you take when you're a woman alone-- Always looking to get ripped off by some man. -What's that? -I'm Bec. Heard a lot about you, Jude. Oh, she's cute. Trained her on the paper yet? (chuckles) Where are they? We can get them back. How? Same way we got them in the first place. Take them. Hey, Ned, what are we gonna do? "We"? Who sent you an invitation? Ned! What are we gonna do? We... are gonna eat. (sighs) Hey. It's Cindy Brady. Hey. I'm really glad Ned didn't kill you. Yeah. Well, me, too. I knew he wouldn't, though. He likes you too much. What tipped you off? The way he threw me across the room, or the way he holds a gun on me? (chuckles softly) I can just tell. You like him? Yeah, I guess I do. At least the only way I know how. What's it to you? Got a little schoolgirl crush on him? That it? Maybe. He's been good to me. He did shoot uncle Mike 'cause he tried to hurt me. He killed Mike? -I don't know. -Jesus. I don't know if he's dead or not. I don't want to know. I just know that he stopped him from hurting me, that's all. You can't help but like a man for shooting somebody for you, right? Don't go love simple. Ned'd shoot you, too, if you got in his way. (chuckles) I know. I know you would, too. So why did you murder those three people? Murder? Yeah. Ned says you killed three people for no reason. Is that what he says? Yes. Yeah, I shot three people, but it wasn't for no reason. Ned tell you about the job we pulled? We hit the store, grabbed the jewels, started heading out the door, and Ned turns his back. He turned his back on those people. You never turn your back. One of them pulls a gun. He would've opened Ned wide the fuck up if I hadn't shot him. What about the other two? When things start getting hectic, you can't sweat the small stuff. So, just like that. Yeah, only he saves your life, and you go sweet on him. I save his, and he calls me a murderer. Sure, I'm the evil one. Can't be trusted for nothin'. All I know is, I didn't push Ned out of that car. Maybe you didn't push him out. Maybe he just fell out by accident. Maybe. Or maybe he figured he'd do better on his own with the cops chasing me. Last thing I remember seeing is his hand reaching for the jewels. And I'm the bad guy? (dry chuckle) That's a man for you, little girl-- Always looking to take a woman down. That's not true, Jude. He saved me. One good turn a man does you. How many times has it been the other way around? How many times have you gotten a man's affection from the back of his hand or the end of his belt? Yeah. I figured you'd been on the getting end once or twice. My father. You don't need to tell me. He's a drunk, right? (scoffs) Every time he gets a fix on, he thinks he can do anything he wants to you. Gets so bad, sometimes you think... that you'd rather wake up dead than wake up at all. We've all been there, one way or another. There's a war going on between men and women, and they got all the advantages. It's their world. The only weapon a woman's got is her sex. Wiggle your ass. Smile, smile. That'll bring a man to his knees. But use it, and what do they call you? A bitch and a whore. And all we're trying to do is survive with what we got, keep the score somewhere close to being even. Yeah, but you can't go around trying to get even all the time. Two wrongs don't make a right. You gotta give people what's coming 'em and take what's yours. What goes around, comes around. Jesus! It's like talking to a fortune cookie. You know, it may sound stupid, but I believe it. I do. You have to believe in something. Don't you believe in anything? Where's Ned? He's tired. Went to bed. (snorts) My bed, no doubt. Go on in there. I got a couple sleeping bags in the car. And lock the door behind you. Oh... Hey, sorry about the way things turned out, Jude, 'cause I thought you and me were real good together. Put it in your diary, T. It'll help keep the memories alive. Hey. Hey. You and me could keep on being good together. -How's that? -Well, I don't know, uh... I don't know how much those jewels you stole are worth, but I know that two can go a lot further on them than three. You cutting Ned out of it just like that? Wouldn't you? Come on, baby, what am I talking here? You already tried. If I did, look how far it got me. It's gonna be different this time. You got me backing you up. Ooh. Let me buy some of that stock. Hey. You know what? I don't know whether to kiss you or slap you. What's the difference? Just because you got it once... don't think I give it away. Slut. What did you call me? (sniffs) Called you a slut. (chuckles) Do you know what the difference between a slut and a bitch is? A slut is a woman who will sleep with any man. A bitch... is a woman who will sleep with any man... except you. Is this him? I said Coke Bottles is a pasty fuck with glasses. Does that guy look like a pasty fuck? Doesn't even have glasses. Well, where the hell is he? We've been here all morning. If you got someplace else to be, T, don't let us stop you. Hey, you gonna eat that chili dog? Good arm. You know, I have to admit, you guys really put one over on me. The way you set me up. Didn't see it coming. Not for a second. Good one, really. Hey, Ned, how long you and T been friends? What difference does it make? I don't know. Just want to know how close you two were. T tell you we fucked? When he was supposed to be watching me, he was fucking me, but I guess you already know that 'cause, you know, you're good friends. I was also wondering if he told you that after last night when you went to sleep, T was trying to sell me on the idea that, you know, once we get the jewels back, we ought to just cut you out of the picture. (awkward chuckle) Yeah, he probably told you that, too. He was probably just testing me to see if I'd cross you. Of course if he didn't tell you, then I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw a piano. Would you shut the fuck up? Hard to get good help nowadays, isn't it, Ned? (scoffs) She's lying. What, are you gonna believe that? After what she did to you? Hey, this is T sitting here. I'd never cross you, Ned. Come on, man! It's not gonna work, Jude. That may work with some of the boys, but you're not going to get any mileage out of me with it. Sorry. Hey, hey, that's him. -Told you. -(car door closes) Pasty fuck. Look at those glasses. Strong enough to make the dead see. I'm not talking about a lake in Israel. That bastard. Pay for what he did to me. I'd like to cut him to bits myself. (slurps) Hey, how about we get another round of smoothies? JUDE: Here's the setup. The front door works on a buzzer, security camera covers it. Coke Bottles is on the second floor. Two flights of stairs. They're narrow with not a lot of room to move. Bad place to get stuck. Coke Bottles' office has got a fence around it. That door works on a buzzer, too. After that? Nothing. Just an empty loft. T: Not much of a setup. He's a fence. He doesn't keep a lot of merchandise around. He's got to keep it moving. NED: How do you know he's still got the jewels? Told me they're too hot to move. He's still got them. Okay. Here's how we work it. (camera whirring) I set up a meeting with him, tell him I've got some merchandise to move. -COKE BOTTLES: What? -Taylor. NED: T comes along for backup. We got to sneak you past the camera. T: Oh, that's not a problem. NED: Once we get inside, we play it straight till we're sure everything is cool. Any trouble, T is half a step behind me. The last thing I've got to do is take care of the fence door. (lock buzzes) If the rest of it's like Jude says, then we hit him. Then beat it back down to the car, and I'll get us out of there. -Nope. -What do you mean, no? -As in you're not driving. -You got to have a car. I know that. She's driving. -Her? -Mm-hm. -(scoffs) She can't drive. -Turn the wheel and go fast. Have you lost your mind? What if something goes wrong? She's not gonna be able to get you out of there. -She's driving. -You're crazy. Will you stop it with those goddamn pictures? I've never seen a crime planned before. Bec is driving. That's final. If Jude wants to drive, it's okay. Really. I think my driver's license is expired. Thank you very much. But I've had enough of Jude's driving. You're behind the wheel. And what am I supposed to do until you get back? Why don't you catch Ricki Lake? She's always talking about some shit. (T and Bec chuckle) How do I even know you're coming back? What's to keep the three of you from, you know, lighting out of here with the jewels? You don't, which will give you something to think about while we're gone. Coke Bottles. Yeah? -I'm Taylor. -(chuckles) Sure you are. I don't care what you call yourself. I'm only interested in what you got to move. I want a good price. Best on the market, minus 35 for my cut. If what you got is as good as you said on the phone. I think you're going to like it. Let's take a look. Ooh, gun. -Ooh. T! -Yeah. What? What are you, some fucking cop? I didn't do nothing. Now, I want the jewels. Uh, what jewels? A lady came in here to fence some jewels. You took them off her. I want them back. You're her guy, ain't you, the one that got dumped back in Arizona? That's me. (chuckles) The jewels. You're a fucking idiot. You know that? (laughing) (grunts) Aah! Son of a bitch! Shoot him in the leg. He'll talk. You don't know what you're doing! Shoot him in the fucking leg. -(gun cocks) -Whoa! (screams) (panting) You killed Alfred! (grunting) (groaning) Now, give me the jewels. Man, you really are a fucking idiot. You said that. You don't get it. I don't have them. Never did. She came in here, she tried to get tough. I let her go. Big mistake. She set you up. (starter turning over) Set us both up. And you bought it. She played you like a record, and you bought it. You are an idiot, man. You are an idiot! Start the car. Bec, start the car! (engine starts) My God, you're shot! Drive! (tires screeching) Yeah, I need a cab. Taking a trip? -I knew you'd cut out. -I was going to go look for you-- -Lie. Lie! -Yeah, what the hell happened? -Lie, Jude. -Ned. -Where are the jewels? -What are you talking about? -You are a fucking liar. -(scoffs) Coke Bottles took 'em-- (grunts) Oh, my-- Jesus Christ. Lay off the face! Jude, you have one more chance at this. Where are those fucking jewels? I went to coke Bottles, and he ripped me off, just like I said. Wrong. Let's work it another way. You went to Coke Bottles, and you took some heat, but he didn't take them off you, did he? So you sent me over there to kill him or he was going to kill me, or better yet, we were going to kill each other. That would be the best. But it didn't work out that way, did it, Jude? You planned this whole thing. Just like you planned on never coming back for me. (laughs) (whispers) Honey, so help me, I'll kill you for this. We've been here before, Ned. You pull that trigger now, and you walk away with nothing. That the way you're gonna play it? Mmm. (swallows) (click) (trembling breath) That's better. Now you're thinking with your head. We can work something out. -Where... -Oh! -Are... -God! -The jewels? -Ned! -(belt cracks) -Oh, God! Come on, Jude. Oh, God! I'll beat it out of you. Ned, stop. You're going to kill her. Stop! (screams) Ned, stop! JUDE: No! -(gunshot) -(Ned grunts) (thump) What the hell did you do? I shot him. Why?! You saw how he was. He was just like my father. I had to shoot him! Let's go. Come on, I gotta get us out of here. Come on. (engine stops) Come on. Come on. Come on. (creaks) Let's go. (gasps) Hey, Jude. What... You little bitch. I'd like to think I learned a few things from you, Jude. Toss 'em. Do me a favor, okay? Just not in the face. Do it! Go on and do it! (Jude crying) (uncocks gun) (sobbing) What the hell happened to us? Oh, God. I don't know. (sniffles) Guess we just sort of lost our way. The bitch of it is I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Doesn't matter anymore. No, Ned. I mean it. I'm sorry. -(knife clicks) -(inhales heavily) -(Ned groans) -(gasps) (groans) -Looking for these? -Oh. I'll do it quick. You won't feel a thing. (gunshots) Unh. Take 'em. Take the keys and go. (car engine starts) (chuckling) Ah. What? I was thinking... about... -(opens lighter) -...Jeannie. (chuckling) God... and Jeannie... ...in a fight. That's fucking funny. (laughs) Unh. BEC: That's it. That's all I know. That's how it happened. Pretty much, anyway. Maybe I made it sound better in parts. A little more romantic. (light chuckle) But that's pretty much how it happened. (police radio chatter) MAN: Captain. What have you got? We found enough of 'em to make a positive ID. It's the two we've been looking for. We also came across a few of these. The rest are probably scattered around. Doesn't look like much worth dying for, does it? You want I should book the girl? What for? It's not worth it. Call her father and arrange for her to be sent home. Here you are. It's a one-way ticket back home. Your father will be waiting when you get there. I really ought to wait here with you. I'll be all right, you know, if you have to go somewhere. Heh. Yeah. I'm not gonna run away. I have no place to run to, so... MAN (on PA): The Rocky Mountain Limited from Denver, Colorado, scheduled to arrive at 4:30, will be delayed 30 minutes. Remember, if your father gives you any more trouble-- I know. Call the cops. You guys are real helpful. MAN (on PA): The train from Denver will now arrive on the west track at 5:00 p.m. MAN (on PA): The Coast Starlight train number 418 to Vancouver, B.C., with stops in San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle, now boarding on the east track. I want to cash this in for another one. -To where? -Canada. [typing] Got a train that leaves in about eight minutes. Makes a couple of connections, but it'll get you to Vancouver. I'll take it. All right. Run you an extra $42.38. I don't have $42. (scoffs) What do you think, we're giving rides away? MAN (on PA): The Coast Starlight train number 418 now boarding on the east track. I have this. It's worth $2,000. Maybe more. It's real. Well, if it's not, then I'm out 42 bucks. And if it is, you don't have to come to work next week. (typing) (printer humming) One-way, Vancouver. Thank you.
