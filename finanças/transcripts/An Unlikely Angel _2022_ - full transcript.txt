- What a gorgeous day. - Thank you. - So, are we looking at anyone in particular, or are we just sightseeing? - Gabe, you know we always have a purpose. - Good point. So, what's the assignment? - There's a woman I want you to watch. Her name is Janie Caswell, and I think she may need a little help. - With what? - Just pay attention, you'll see. - Ah, there you are. Okay, listen. You had some of that spicy chicken, didn't you? Janie, you know your stomach can't handle that. - I didn't have the spicy chicken. - Oh, okay, so then what is it? Because I've been texting you for about an hour, and everybody's headed to the boardroom, and Steven's already prepping. - I can't do this. I knew I couldn't do this. - What are you talking about? Your pitch is brilliant. If anybody should be worried, it's Steven. - It's not the pitch. - Well, are you okay? Is the baby okay? - It's a girl! - Oh my God. Okay, so David's thrilled, right? - David doesn't know. It was supposed to be a surprise. I mean, not like any other surprise. This whole pregnancy's been a surprise and... Okay, just breathe. - And now I littered. - It's okay, just, it's okay. It's okay. ♪ Da-da-da-da-da hey ♪ - Gabe? Gabe! - Sorry, sir. Where is it that you needed me to go again? Ah. Okay. Got it. I'll be right there. - I tried to tell David before we were married that I don't think I have what it takes to be a mom, you know, especially to a girl. I don't know anything about girls. - Yeah, you do. I mean, just think about when you were little. - I was like a dude. - You were? - Yeah. I didn't even have a doll. - Okay. Yeah, it's a little different. I don't, I don't know how to respond to that one. - You know, I didn't even have a female friend until I was in college, and that was only because we bonded over spreadsheets in business class, where everyone else was a male. You know, if it was a boy, I think I could have faked it. But now that it's a girl, it's... Bag! - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, Janie, look at me. I need you to pull yourself together, okay? We have a boardroom full of executives waiting to hear a pitch that determines the future of this company. Can you focus? - Mm hmm. - Okay. - Let me focus. How? - I have no clue. Why don't you try that mantra thing on your desk? The one about, you know, not worrying or something. - Don't worry about anything, so pray about everything. - Yeah, that one. Do that. - Just 'cause it's on my desk, doesn't mean I know how to do that. - Yes you do. You're a girl boss. You've got this. - Oh. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. - Mm hmm, I'm a girl boss. - Mm hmm. - I'm not pregnant. - Exactly. - Not terrified. - That's the spirit! - Strong. - Do me a favor, fix that. Mascara's a mess, okay? You got it. - Help, please. - Don't worry, I got you. Help is on the way. - Hey, man. - Hey! - Is this what you're looking for? - This is exactly what I'm looking for. - Great. - Okay, how much is it? - Only 50. - 50? - Yeah. - Done deal. There you go, man. Thank you so much. - Want some help with that? - Oh, thanks, I got a Guide Ride coming. - You're looking at him. - What, are you Gabe? - In the flesh! - Wow, that was fast. - It looks like you've got a kid at home, huh? - Yeah, well, not yet, but soon. I got this hopefully to inspire my wife to get out and have a little fun. - Oh, she's a real doer, yeah? - Oh yeah. But, you know, it's good to be super prepared and organized. - I bet you're the kinda guy who loves to just relax and take life as it comes. - Actually, yeah. How'd you know? - Mm. I'll tell you what though, I do agree with you on one thing. - Oh, yeah? - Live life one day at a time, and never forget to enjoy it. - Now I just have to convince my wife of that. Nice car by the way. - Oh, thanks. Right. - Marcus, should I start? I guess Janie's not coming. - Oh, no, she'll be here, sir. Focus. You are a girl boss. Sorry I'm late. - Okay? - Stay close, I may throw up. - Alright, Marcus, should we begin, sir? - Oh, okay. Go ahead, Dawson. - Alright, so I brought home one of these Tidy Tanya prototypes for my youngest daughter, Callie, and it has not left her side for a week, and her room is clean. Now, the American Girl franchise did 70 million in sales last quarter. And we're all looking for that next Pumpkin Patch Pals, or American Girl, are we not? Well, meet Tiny Teen Friends. You got a problem telling the truth? True Blue Betty is your gal. You have problem sleeping? Peaceful Penny is your pal. These dolls help little girls through their issues of childhood, while letting them be little girls. And I say for 49.95 a pop, let them be little girls as long as they want. - But Steven, that's the problem. Little girls aren't staying little girls. They're growing up fast. And we need to grow up with them. The Pumpkin Patch Pals company ended in bankruptcy in 1988, because they didn't. Now, you can get one on eBay for less than five bucks. Interactive media is a multi-billion dollar industry that mainly caters to boys age seven to 17. So, I propose that we raise stakes with an edgy new gaming series for girls. No more princess games. Let's really engage them. Girl Power Extreme. Pajama alien invasion. Girls are just having fun, hanging out. And then all of a sudden... But these girls don't call for help or get scared, they prepare. Our seven to 17 year old girls decide on how the alien's gonna go down. Laser zap, alien melting spray, it's gamer's choice. And that's what I'm talking about. David, Why is there a baby carrier blocking the door? - Oh no. Hey, I'm sorry. Hang on, I got it, I got it. There we go here. Hey, look at that. Now, we can ride our bikes after the baby comes. - I could have sworn we stopped riding bikes like six months ago. - It's never too late to start up again. How'd your pitch go? - Well, nothing official, but it felt great. What about you? How was your day? What? - Come on, I wanna show you something. - Okay. - Oh. Okay, no peeking. Watch your step. No peeking. - Mm hmm. - Okay, right there. Ready? - Mm hmm. - And open. Huh, what do you think? - You did it without me? - Well, babe, the times I asked you to help me out, you were a little busy, so... - I know, I'm sorry. I don't think we're ready, mm mm. - Well, I don't think this little boy or our little girl is gonna wait, so- - It's a girl. - What? - I know, I'm sorry. I was on the exam table, and she thought I already knew, and then she just blurted it all out. And I'm so, so sorry. I would've totally waited for you, but I just didn't have a choice, because she just kind of said it in front of me and- - Slow down. It's a girl? It's a girl. Oh my gosh. Oh, sweetie. - Oh, I'm so bad at this. Out there, I'm invincible, and then in here, I'm just- - Hey, sweetie, it's okay. Relax, come here. - I didn't even set up the crib. I'm gonna be a horrible mother. - Sweetie, slow down, slow down. Hey, we'll just take it one day at a time, huh? - Okay, take it one day at a time. That is just so impractical. - Okay, come, come here. - Mm, I can't, I'll squish you. - I like getting squished. That's what good husbands do. - Okay. - Come on. - Mm. - Oh man, you know, you are heavy. - See! - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Sweetie, what makes you think you're gonna be a bad mom? - I'm not built to be a mom. I'm a business woman, not a baby woman. - Is that even a word, baby woman? - Mm hmm, you know what I mean. - I like it, it sounds exuberant. I know we're gonna be a family soon. And I know, you'll be great. We'll figure it out, okay? Come here. - Okay, so rumor has it, it's all you. You are so getting that corner office, which means I'm getting yours. Can I get a yay? - Yeah, that's great. - Okay, well then why don't you sound as excited as I do? I'm like, what's going on? - Nothing, I just feel a little weird. - What do you mean, weird? You mean like, maybe you're having the baby! - Don't say it. - Well, how far apart? - I'm sure I should know the answer to that question. - This is awesome! But adjust the brontosaurus. Too whiny. Caswell! We're going with Girl Power Extreme. Congratulations! - Yes, awesome. Nice. - Let's talk about what's next. It doesn't have to be right now. - I got this. - Hey, breathe, breathe. I'm calling a Guide Ride. I'm not doing this. - No, no, no, I don't have time for a Guide Ride. I need to just walk. - You can't even walk! - Oh, no! Gotta sit, gotta sit! Ow, make it stop! - You can't sit on the sidewalk! Okay, okay, okay. - Okay, okay. Okay. - I got you, let's go. - What, who are you? - No, no, no, it's alright, it's alright. I'm gonna get you right where you need to go. So, your husband's a resident at Murray Hill? - How do you know that? - Ah, you know? Is this your first? - Yes, and probably my last. - Don't say probably. You never know what the future holds. - Okay, definitely, definitely my last. - You want my advice? You know, the thing about life, and kids for that matter, you can't plan too much. Like they say, "Control is just an illusion." - Is this from the guy's guide to useless sayings? - Sorry, I was just trying - Don't answer it! - to take you mind off of it. - Just drive! I'm sorry, I just wanted- - Is she okay? - She's perfect. I'm just wrapping her up for you. Wow. Oh my gosh. - She's so big. She's beautiful. Happy birthday, Samantha. - Samantha, after your mother. - What's wrong, what's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing, sweetheart. You're just, she needs to be held differently. - Well, how? I mean, this is the only way I know to go to hold her, like his. - Well, just, you know, cradle her, support her head. - Her head? Wait, wait, what's wrong with her head? - Nothing. Just, babies have no neck. - She has no neck? Oh my gosh! Her neck! - No, I'm just saying, just hold her head. - Or what? - They bobble. - Oh no, she's bobbling! - Relax. - Oh gosh! - Here, here, I got her. - Oh, oh. - - Come here, come here. - Please take her, oh! - Come here, come here. I got you. It's okay. Dad to the rescue. Hey, come on, come on. Hey, come on, sweetie. Hey, sweetie, sweetie. See? There you go, see? Right, see? Nice and easy. Nice, nice. - Um, I forgot the thick blanket upstairs. We gotta go back. - Janie, relax. You packed it in the baby bag, remember? - Oh, yeah. Thank goodness. - You're not gonna take that, are you? - No. Oh, it's Connie. - You know you don't have to? - Hi, Connie. Thank you! No, no, you're kidding. No, no, don't do anything until I get there, okay? Please. Thanks. - Geez. - I gotta go. - What, the car's not even here yet. - I know, I gotta go to work. Can you just help me? Thank you. Sorry, the lead in Girl Power Extreme is demanding double pay. You just take Sam, and I'll meet you at home, okay? - You just had a baby 12 hours ago, okay. You can't just leave her like this. - Just meet me at home, okay? I'm so sorry, I'll be really quick. I'll soon be back. Just take Sam. I'll be back in no time, okay? - Seriously? - Yes. Oh, perfect. Connie, I just got in the car. Oh, excuse me, can you just go as fast as you can? I'm in hurry, please. Con, Connie, listen to me. Can you, did you talk to her agent yet? Oh, just, yes, wait for me. Don't take 42nd. Terrible this time of day. - Whatever you say, Janie. - Hold on. Excuse me, have we met? - How's that baby of yours? - Oh. How lucky, I got the same Guide Ride guy twice. Connie, yeah, no, I'm hurrying, yeah. - Actually, there is some divine intervention happening. - Excuse me? - I'm an angel. I was sent here to help you. - Let me guess, you're also Spider-man in Times Square on the weekends, dancing around? No, I'm still here, Connie, yeah. No, take a left up here. You're gonna miss it! - You sure? - Yes! Hey, you're gonna miss it! Turn around! Left! Turn, just turn! David? - You're awake. Stay there, stay there. I'll be right back. - What's Mom's Bible doing here? David? Where are you? - That's good, huh? Looking pretty nice so far. - Needs more cinnamon. - What? I bet you would like more cinnamon. - Needs more cinnamon. - You guys and the cinnamon. Good morning. Lily, hi. Is she still awake? - Yes, and talking up a storm. I have never seen anything like it. - Can we see her? - Absolutely. - Oh, okay. Oh, Mommy's been asleep for a long time. I'm gonna go in first, make sure she's okay. - Come on, Sam. - Janie? - David. - Oh, Janie. - Okay, oh, you're kind of crushing me. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Where's Samantha? - She's here, she's here. She's just out in the hall. - Oh, why is she in the hall? Can you bring her to me? I'm sure she's so hungry. I need to start feeding her. Okay, I'll just go. Oh my gosh. My legs, they feel like lead. Didn't we already leave the hospital? - Don't you, don't you remember? - Remember what? - The accident. - Uh, I remember the guy who said he was Spider-man, yeah. No, no, he said, he said angel, and then I told him to turn. We're not in New York, are we? - No, not really. - Why are we not in New York? - Okay. Ummm... Okay, here's the thing. You were pretty sick. Sam was just a little baby. I was trying to handle my residency and you. - Is the room spinning or is it just me? - We can talk later. - Where am I? - Why don't you just rest for now? Okay, that's quite a grip. - David, tell me where I am. - We're in Southport, living with your dad. - Why would we be living with my dad? And who is this little girl? - Um. Oh boy. - Now, don't hurt me. Two, three. You got me! - What do you think they're doing? - Well, I don't know. You wanna check? Come on. - Looks like her mouth still works. - Remind you of someone? - She's pretty when she's awake. - Yeah. - Six years is a very, very long time. - I know, it really is. - And Sam's here? - She's waiting with your dad. Should I go get her? Come on in, guys. - Hi. - I'll go. - You're back! Boy, are you a sight for sore eyes. - She hates me. - Oh, no, no, honey. She's just, she's just overwhelmed, that's all. - No, I knew she'd hate me, and she does. What have I done? - Oh, you haven't done anything. - I haven't been there for her. Why did this happen? - I don't know. But I do know that all things work together for good, for those who love God. - I have been out of my daughter's life for six years, and David's life, and yours. How can that be good? - Well, I guess the good part is you woke up. Oh, honey, God has served you up such real-life miracle. I suppose it's what you choose to do with it from this time forward, well, that's that's up to you. You're my miracle. - Here he is. See, I knew he'd find you. So, I've got to go visit a few patients, but if you guys need anything, you come find me, okay? - Thank you, Lily. - Oh. Pretty scary, huh? Mom's been asleep all this time, and now she's awake. - She looked different. - Well, imagine how you must look to her. Last time she saw you, you were just a little baby. Now you're almost ready to get married. - Dad, I hate boys! - Oh, that's right, that's right. Except for Tommy. - Only because he's my best friend. - Oh. - When is mom gonna come home with us? - As soon as the doctor says she can. - Do you think she'll read me a story at bedtime? - Oh, I bet she will. I'll bet you she'll tell you stories, she'll tuck you in. - You know, Mom didn't have anyone tuck her in for a long time, did she? - I never thought of it that way. But no, I guess she didn't. - Hi. - Hi. Do you wanna come over? - Is okay if I come up? - Yeah, I'd love that. - Do you know any stories? - Stories? - Bedtime stories? - Yeah, you know, I know one that my mom used to tell me. - What's it about? - It is about a princess, who had fallen asleep for a very long time. Until one day her prince came along, and woke her up. - Did she have a little girl? - You know what, I think she did. - Okay, I'm ready. - Once upon a time, there was a princess with a beautiful little girl, with long brown hair. - Like me? - Exactly like you. - I love that story. - Good morning, sunshine. Good book? - You know, I think I heard somewhere that it was a bestseller. - Mm. - You should give it a read sometime. - Oh, I have, cover-to-cover. Imperative in my line of work. - You taking me for a spin? - Well, a little birdie told me that you're going for physical therapy today. Is that true? - Depends, seagull or heron? - Oh, I don't know. But whatever it was, it was wearing a stethoscope. Alright, sister, let's go. Up, up and we're going on three. One, two, three. And one, two, three, down. Got it. Feet up. Alright, let's take her for a spin. ♪ Lost your way, lost your cool ♪ ♪ Then you straight up lost your mind ♪ ♪ Tried so hard to stay ahead, but you keep falling behind ♪ ♪ Life is gonna pull you down, make it hard to see ♪ ♪ But a little change in your point of view ♪ ♪ Could be just what you need ♪ ♪ Happiness is wonderful, but it doesn't stick around ♪ ♪ Walking on sunshine, then here come the clouds ♪ ♪ You can laugh or you can cry when it all falls apart ♪ ♪ But I believe the more you laugh ♪ ♪ The more you heal the heart ♪ ♪ There's always a reason to always choose joy ♪ ♪ There's something deeper that the world can't destroy ♪ ♪ Smile, when you think you can't ♪ ♪ Smile, get up and dance ♪ ♪ Smile, there's a bigger plan ♪ ♪ The storm only last for a while ♪ ♪ So smile ♪ - Poster looks so good. - And once she gets home tomorrow, maybe we could play fish shack. - Well, I'd better bait the hooks then, huh? Hello? It's Mommy. - Hi, honey. We're here, just waiting for your homecoming. - Hi Mom. I can't wait to see you. - I know, me too. Oh, and David, can you bring me some clothes to wear from the hospital? - Oh, I should have thought of that. - What about Aunt Kelly? Maybe she could give Mom some clothes to borrow? - Good idea. - Uh, who's Aunt Kelly? - A friend. - You have a friend who can just let me borrow clothes? - Yeah, at least I'm pretty sure she wouldn't mind. - Oh, well I can't wait to see you tomorrow. - Can't wait. Say goodbye to Mommy. - Bye, Mommy. - Bye! - I've been looking at pictures of your little girl for a long time. - I know. Hi, honey. - Hey. Looks like someone beat me here. - Well, I had to come say goodbye to my favorite patient. Now, remember what the doctor said? - Yes, I will take it slow. - Mm, why don't I believe her? - It's because you're a very wise woman, Lily. - Mm hmm, I sure am. - Mm. - Now, all kidding aside, you guys, this is gonna be very different, alright? Take some time together, okay? - So, noted. - Yeah. - What am I gonna do without you, Lily? - Aw, I'm gonna miss you so much. But you can keep reading this, that's for sure. - Oh, here's the clothes you wanted. - Right, from your friend. Who is she, by the way? - Kelly, she's just a neighbor. Sam's best friends with her son, and they live across the street, so it's- - Convenient? - Yeah, that's a good way to put it. - Alright, let's see what we have here. A pair of very large pants. - Oh no, they the wrong size? - Oh, no offense, I just think that your friend is like six sizes bigger than me. - So, strange, I always thought she had a nice figure. I mean, not that I noticed. It's just, she never seemed large. - Well, next time you see her, thank her for me. Anything is a welcome change after hospital gowns. Am I making you uncomfortable? - I'll just give you some privacy. Yeah, it's... I'll just be right out here. - Feels like going back in time. - Yeah, not much has really changed. - That's new. - Oh yeah, that's Kelly's place, the one who's pants you're wearing. - Oh, she owns her own business? What's her husband do? - She's not married. Divorced. - That's too bad. Antique cars? What happened to dad's boating business? - He had to close it down a few years ago. - Why? - Well, we thought it would be more cost effective to work from home. Made a workspace at the dock, which is great. Better than that warehouse. - Wait, we? What, are you like in business with my dad now? - Yeah, I had to quit my residency. Hours were too crazy, and- - I was comatose. - Hey, it's okay. Honestly, it's, it's all good. - Well, you drop out of medical school, and dad loses his warehouse. I don't know if I'd call that okay. - Okay, maybe partly good. Bad with a dollop of good? - How are you joking about it? - I mean, life happens, you know? Things change. I actually kind of like working with your dad. - Well, you could always go back to medical school, and I could go back to work, and then- - I don't want to go back, Janie. - Why not? - Because I wanna go forward. Look, let's just get you back for now, okay? And, well, Sam's got a surprise for you. This is probably the happiest day of her life. - Mine too. - What are we waiting for? - This is for you. - It's beautiful. Did you make it? - Grandpa helped. - You know that your daddy and I used to see dolphins like this when we'd go sailing. - Before I was born? - Mm hmm. Do you think that we should go sailing, all of us together, you, me and Daddy? - That'd be fun. - Okay. - Hey, why don't you go show mommy what you have set up in the living room? - So good to have you back. - It's good to be back. - Welcome home, Mommy. - Oh, thank you. I love the sign. Did you make it? - Grandpa and Daddy helped. And look what else. - Oh, my old tea-party table. - Did you use to play tea party? - Well, not tea party, exactly. - She used to play office. - My stuffed animals, Polly and Tabitha used to sit in those very chairs, ready to play any moment. - Those were her secretaries that she bossed around. - You were an odd little kid, weren't you? - Polly and Tabitha never complained. I gave them profit sharing and stock options. - I don't play office, but I still have Polly and Tabitha. - You do? Well, do you play tea party with them? - Not really, we use this table for fish shack. - Oh, well, how do you play fish shack? - First, Polly, Tabitha and I go fishing. Then we bring in the catch of the day, and Tommy and Daddy buys them at the fish shack. I'm the checkout girl. - That sounds fun. So, where are Polly and Tabitha now? - I'm not sure. Do you know, Grandpa? - Well, let's go look. Come on. - I have never seen her this excited before. - She does seem happy, doesn't she? - And you didn't know if you were gonna be a good mom. All that worry for nothing. - Alright, I know you wanna say it. - Me, no. I would never tell you I told you so. - Alright, I admit it, you were right. You expecting someone? - Not that I know of. - Hi, hi, the door was open. Kelly! - You're Kelly? - Hi. Do you want me to put these on a platter? - Sure, yeah. Kelly makes the best brownies ever. - Well, he is an easy mark with his sweet tooth. - Well, Kelly's an incredible baker. She owns a bakery in town. - I know, you already told me. - Oh, and this is Tommy. Tommy, say hi to Janie. - Hi! Is Sam here? - Check the bedroom. Mm. - Anyway, we are all just so happy you are finally out of that nasty old coma. - Yeah, yeah. I'm happy to be out of that nasty old coma too. - And I'm glad to see you could make use of my clothes. They look great on you. - Yeah, it's odd, I can't imagine you wearing these. You're so little. - Oh, no, those are my pregnancy clothes, silly. I haven't worn those since Tommy was born. - Oh, that explains it. Can I get you something to drink? - Oh, no, no, no, don't bother. We just wanted to come by and say welcome home. I actually have to get back and call a repairman. - Not the water heater again? - Yep. - Did you check the pilot light? - Oh shoot, I forgot. You know, I cannot tell you what a huge help he has been over the years. - I bet. - Well, let's check it before you call somebody. - Oh, no, no, no, you've got your hands full, what with Janie just getting home and all. - It won't take a minute. Come on. As long as it's okay? - Oh, of course, yeah. I mean why call someone, when you can just check the pilot light? - I won't keep him too long. - Okay, let's go. - "Oh, he's been such a help over the past four years, you have no idea. Just so lovely." Mm. Oh, boy. - Whatcha you doing? Are you hiding? - No, ummm... I was uh... looking for a hairbrush. - I have a hairbrush. I could get it. Come on, Tommy. - Don't forget about that pilot light. - I know, you tell me every time. - Janie! Janie, are you okay? - Did you fall, honey? - Yeah, I'm just, I'm fine. I'm just like looking for something. - Here's my brush. - Oh, you want Kelly to do your hair? Kelly's the only one she'll let touch her hair. - You and grandpa pull too hard. - I could do yours too, Janie, if you want? - Oh, no, no, no. - Please, Mommy. We'll look just alike. - Well, look at you two. - You like? - Yeah, it's very uh... youthful. - Yeah, that Kelly, she is multi-talented. - Alright. - Dad, I am so sorry about your warehouse, but this is amazing. - Well, thanks to David. He organized all of this. - Well, it's good to know my medical training wasn't a complete loss. - Is Kelly still here? - No, she went home right after she did all the dishes. - And made Daddy's favorite kind of cupcakes. - Well, that was nice of her. - Very. - This is our boat, Mommy. See, do you like it? - I do. Sweet Dreams. - We're just about ready to take her out for her first sail. - Just in time for someone's birthday. - Speaking of your birthday, how about you and me do a little shopping day tomorrow? - Really? - Yeah. I need to get some new clothes, and we can get you a few outfits for your birthday. That sound fun? Okay. - Hold on ladies, let's not make too big of a plan. Maybe you should wait till the morning, see how you feel? - Well, Daddy can see how he feels in the morning, but one thing I know for sure, these two girls need a shopping day, right? - Right. - I had fun with you today. - Me too. - Get some sleep so we can have more fun tomorrow, okay? Don't forget that. - Mama, I'm glad you're home. - Me too. - How's Sam? - All tucked in. - Good. - I can't believe how many nights like this I've missed. - Well, now you get to make up for it. I'm sorry about the whole shopping thing. I just worry. The last thing the hospital said- - No, I know, I know. But I'm not an invalid anymore, okay? I won't do more than I can handle. - Promise? - I promise. - Okay. Well, you should probably get some sleep. - Mm hmm. - Good night. - Okay. - And the lion was asleep, but daddy said he thinks that was because he must have had a big lunch. So, we went to the tiger cage, and there were two tigers. I guess they didn't have lunch yet. - Aw, well this sounds like a really cool zoo. Can you take me some time? Okay, good. - I have a loose tooth. - You do? - Daddy says the second tooth is a lucky tooth, and the tooth fairy will bring me something special. - I bet you she will. Come on. No way. - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing, honey. Just something from Mommy's past. Can you hold on one second. Hi, is Connie Tibbs there? Actually no, her last name might have changed. - Hey, look, it's Aunt Kelly! - Yes, can you let her know Janie Caswell is back. And yes, this number is great. Okay, perfect. I have a question for you. - What? - Have you ever been to get your hair cut? - Yeah, Aunt Kelly does it all the time, remember? - Okay, at a real life salon? - Wow, what's that? - Okay, let's go. We've been shopping! - I can see that. - Here, I'll take that inside. - That's a whole lot of pink you got on, kiddo. And that hair, it looks- - Curly. - Get over here and sit next to Papa. You know, there's one thing I know about hair? Well, actually, I don't know anything about hair. But I'm guessing curls wash out, hmm? You remember last year, when you got really good at riding bikes, and poor Tommy, he just couldn't get the knack of it? Well, you were real nice to him. Do you remember what you did? - I told him we could ride scooters. - Yes. So, you getting your hair done, is kind of like riding scooters, but for your Mommy. - I sure hope she learns how to ride a bike soon. - You look amazing. - So, the sweater works? - I haven't gotten that far up yet. I do like the sweater though. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Old school. - Yeah. - So, I was in town today, and I saw something interesting at Gamer Extravaganza, their window display? - Yeah, yeah, I've seen it. Westech took your idea and just ran with it. - Yeah, Westech seems to be doing pretty great. - Yeah. - So, how are we doing? I mean, boat repair isn't exactly a doctor's salary. - We're fine. I mean, it can be a challenge, but it's nothing for you to worry about. - Okay. - Dinner's almost ready. - Wow! - My grandpa said it's a lot of pink. - I thought you liked pink? - I do, sorta. - Well, look at that hair. I mean, I like it. - I thought you liked it too. - It was fun going to the beauty parlor at least. - Well, how about we brush it out, and I'll fix it right before dinner, okay? Yeah? - Great idea. - Come on. - Let's go. - Okay, this is going to look great. Hey, Connie, how are you? - That's my question. How are you? - I'm good. I'm great. It's good to have my life back, and be back with my family. - I can't believe I'm even talking to you. I mean, how's David and little Samantha? - Oh, she is amazing. She's not so little anymore. She's turning into a beautiful young lady. - I can imagine. - How about you? How are things there? - Good, really good. I mean, I moved into the corner office, thanks to you and Girl Power Extreme, so. - Oh, that's partially why I called. I mean, I know it went to series, and there have been a few spinoffs. You know, since it was my original concept, I just figured... - Oh, Janie, you know Thompson, what's created at Westech belongs to Westech. - Yeah, I know. I just thought, financially speaking... - You know, Thompson still talks about you, you know? Seriously, if you ever wanna get back into it. But look, I do gotta go. I'm sorry, you already know how it is. But let's, let's stay in touch, okay? Alright. - Hmm, not like I pictured it. - It's okay, Mommy. I know what to do. - Emergency hair repair. - Oh, looks like you brought dinner too. - Oh, I thought you might be too tired to cook. Sam, I'm here. - I'm gonna get you. - So, what did you say then? - What could I say? - I don't know, leave my bakery and never come back? - That's what you would've said. I just put a stamp on his card, and gave him a dozen free scones. - That's a pretty good move. - I thought so. - Hey, you. Well, you barely talked at dinner. Alright, come on, I'm all ears. - Well, my daughter, she's the only girl in the world who doesn't love shopping sprees. My husband won't touch me. And my replacement is sitting in the kitchen right now. - Honey, Kelly could never replace you. Come on. And I don't ever remember you liking shopping sprees at Sam's age, hmm? So, stop worrying. It's gonna be fine. - Is it, Dad? Really? - Yes. My goodness, even when you were a little girl, you were never satisfied unless everything was just right. - Meaning I've always been an obsessive, compulsive, perfectionist, hmm? - Well, it's not all that bad. I mean, I've, honey, I've never known anybody who can get things done better or faster than you. - Except I do things worse and slower. - Well, look, none of us enjoy feeling out of control. - Is that supposed to make me feel better? - Well, yeah. Look, honey, all I'm saying is I get it, okay? We've been doing things here a certain way for six years, and we can't expect everything to change in two days. - I just feel like I should be doing something, just to make it better. - Yeah. This goes against every instinct you have right now, but all I can tell you to do is trust. - Trust what? - It's in God's hands. Oh honey, he's got you. He's not gonna let you down. - Thanks. - The verdict? - Mm, you know, there's something I can't put my finger on here. It's missing something. - Did you get the frosting though, with the bite? Wait, get this bit right here. - I got plenty of frosting. Trust me. - How are things going in here? - Janie, you gotta try these. - I, come on, they're definitely missing something. - Yeah, like flavor. - Okay, gluten free is huge. I just need to find the right ingredients. - I think next time you go without the glue. - Okay, you said the same thing about my scones. - No I didn't. - Yes, you did, remember? When I brought those gluten-free blueberries scones to that PTA meeting? - Oh, that's right. You know what, actually, those scones might have been worse than these cupcakes. - Okay, stop it. - I'm serious. - Oh, here. - Those poor kids - Try! - had to suffer through all the scones. - You are the worst. - Janie? Wow, you look, wow. - Forgot how great the view was here. - So did I. Sorry. - Who was it? - Just Kelly. She just wanted to see if the kids wanna get together tomorrow? - Don't they always get together? - Well, yeah, I guess. - David, she's not asking if the kids can get together. - Yes she did, I just saw. - She's trying to distract you from me. - That's ridiculous. - Look, if you have feelings for her, you gotta let me know. - Okay, Janie, listen I was lost with you being gone. And when Sam and I came back here, I was a mess. And Sam was so tiny, and Buck and I, we didn't have a clue what to do. - So, Kelly helped you figure it out? - She was starting a business she knew nothing about. I helped her, she helped me. - Like a couple. - No, Janie, it wasn't like that. Janie, you're my wife, okay? Awake or not, I love you. And nothing happened with Kelly, because I was still in love with you. And you've no idea how I'm still love with you, Janie. - Sorry. It's Westech. - Go ahead. Go ahead, it's fine. - Hello? - Janie Caswell. Marcus Thompson. - Hi, Mr. Thompson. - Ah, call me Marcus. - Marcus. - Janie, I hear you've got an exciting idea for Westech's next season. - I, I do have a pitch. You can let me know if it's exciting or not. - Well, listen, I'm back in New York on the 29th for the pitch session. I'll have my assistant set it up. - The 29th? - Perfect. I'll see you then. - That's Sam's birthday. - I can take an hour flight, and be back in time for the party. - I'm sure you can. - Come on, David. You know, I'm the best multitasker ever invented, right? - Yeah, the best ever. - Right, you're mad. - Yeah, yeah, I'm a little mad. - But you just said. - You wanna talk about multitasking, hmm? Because the last time you multitasked, I didn't get to talk to you for six years! I know you wanna be in control of everything, but you cannot control how I feel. - Which is how? - Everything was great with you and Sam. And then one little thing, she doesn't like her hair, whole thing blows up. The next thing you know, you're on a plane to New York. You just got back, and you're already talking about leaving. - I just happen to be good at my job. I'm sorry. - I was good at mine too. - This was a bad idea. - Pick me up. - Ooh yeah, Pops. - Good morning, sunshine. Who's ready for a short stack? - Not today, Daddy, I gotta get going. Got research to do for a meeting. - Hmm? - Yes, and she has lots of homework to do. - Oh, okay then. That means a lot more for the rest of us. - I'll be back before you know it, okay? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Bye, guys! - Okay. - Bye. - Count. Okay, Sam, Sam? - Bye! - Okay, let's get you - Is anyone watching? - one of these pancakes, - You need to count! Count them. You ready? How many? - Space Track Executioner, Blood Monkeys, Mangled or Die 2? And these are all Westech? Are you sure these are the most popular in the tween market? They just seem sort of advanced. - Have you've been living under a motherboard? Pop any of these into a kid's hands, the kid will do the rest. - They're so expensive. If I could just pick one, which one? - Bloody Monkeys. Definitely one of my favorites. - Okay. - Oh! Hey, Goliath, Goliath! Sorry, Janie. Goliath doesn't realize how big he is. - Wait, how do you, do we know each other? - We have met. Yeah, you probably don't remember me though. - Aren't you gonna get your dog? How'd you do that? - If I tell you, will you believe me this time? - So, you're really an angel? Wait, you don't have wings. Oh, can you make them appear? You know, I've always wondered about that. - Yeah. I don't really need them. I mean, they look great from pictures, and, but I can pretty much get anywhere I need to without them. - So, why me? - I'm the answer to your prayer. - What prayer? - The one on the rooftop, you know the, "Help me"? - Oh, that. Hardly remember that. - Well, he heard it. - He did? Does he happen to know that I'm kind of like- - A wreck? - Mm hmm. - Yeah, he knows. - What do I do? - Pray. - I already did that. - Janie, prayer isn't just something that you do, or at least not just one time. It's a way to be. It's like the scriptures say, praying without ceasing. - Hmm. - Sure did love your Bible, didn't you, Mom. Dear Lord, thank you for Sam. Thank you that everything's going as well as it is with her. I mean, I know there have been a few hiccups, but thing I was most worried about, being a good mom, I think it's gonna be okay. But my marriage, I never even thought to worry about that. And here I am. I don't know what I'd do without him. If you could just help me trust that everything is gonna work out, because, honestly, I'm really tired of holding it all together, Lord. If you're giving me an opportunity, I'm gonna take it. If you don't want me to, you gotta let me know. Hi, Connie, you still in the office? - I mean, of course, where else would I be? Well, I mean, you have been out of the game quite a while, haven't you? - Yeah, I guess so. - So, Thompson said that you are coming in for a pitch? - I, I mean, I have a couple of ideas, but it's Sam's birthday, so. - Okay, well you can be the first one up, and you can be back on your flight by noon. - Yeah, but I mean, I don't really have a pitch lined up yet, and it happens in two days, so. - That's plenty of time. I mean, come on, this is your way back in, Janie. You've gotta do this. - You really think so? - Absolutely, yes. - I'll see you next week. Hi, I need a couple of games that'd be good for a seven-year-old girl. It's my daughter's birthday tomorrow. - Sure, let's see. That it? - No, just gimme everything you have from Westech. - That's a lot of games. - I don't care. I have a very important pitch. Need to be ready. - You got it. - Oh. Hi. - Well, ahoy, mate. All hands on deck. - Hands are full. Wow, she's ready to sail? - Her maiden voyage! - A whole day before my birthday. - Yes, she couldn't wait for tomorrow. - We're going to Cora's inlet. We're having a picnic and a fire. Come with us, Mama! - Oh honey, I can't. I- - She doesn't have time for a boat ride. - You don't? - Hey, hey! Who's ready for the maiden voyage? Basket. I'm sure there's some goodies in there. Leave this kit here. - You know what, Mommy is coming, okay! - Yay! ♪ And the glory of sunset in every way ♪ ♪ Gives purpose and meaning to the end of the day ♪ - Yeah. - That was- - Very nice. - So, David says you might be taking a business trip to New York City tomorrow? - Oh. - Sorry. - You're going tomorrow? - I am, honey. I was gonna tell you, but I'm just gonna be- - Tomorrow's my birthday! - And I'll be back in time for your party, I promise. Promise. - I'll go talk to her. - No, no, let me. - You can't. - David, please. Hello? Anybody up there? - No. - Hey, honey, what are you doing up here? - Dad and I come up here sometimes, when we're sad. - It's just a business trip. Not even a full day. I can't wait for your birthday. I know it's not wrapped, but got you an early gift. - What are they? - They're video games. Do you like them? - Thank you. - Is this my old toy trunk? - I don't know, but there's lots of cool stuff here. - Aw! - Look. - My mom got me this. I'd forgotten about it. - Oh, I've seen something like this before. A lady sells them down at the farmer's market. - And that lady must be Maggie Gibson. She was my mom's best friend. And do you know on each doll, there is a secret message? - Really? - Mm hmm. - Where? Let's check. - Okay. - Look, you're mine! - Yep, and you're mine. It's true, sweetheart, you're mine and nothing will ever change that. Okay? - Wanna see more? - Wow. - See, you draw with it. - What's this? - You pull the thingy, and look, the tires turn. Grandpa played with this when he was a little boy. - Sam, it's late. Time for bed. - We're up here. We'll come down right now. Do you mind if I borrow some of these things? - I guess so, if you promise to bring them back. - I promise. - Try not to be late. This birthday means a lot to her. - I know, don't worry. - Mommy, wait. - Birthday girl, what are you doing up so early? What is this? - It's for when you get to New York so you don't forget us. - Honey, I could never forget you. I love you. - Okay, but just in case. - I'll be back the second I've done my meeting, okay? Right. - Okay, wave bye to Mommy. - Bye, Mommy. - Hey! - Oh. - My gosh, look at you. You look great. Okay, well, are you ready? - Can you just buy me a moment? - Oh, okay. Well, just hurry. But they're excited, alright? - Mm hmm. Okay, God, if this is what you want, please be clear. - Hey. - See, told you she wasn't dead. - Oh! - Okay, Caswell, what have you got? - Well, it's simple, really. Just keep passing it down, okay guys? - What is it? - It's a kendama. You just get the little ball into the basket. - How do you turn it on? - It's a reinvention of a 15th century toy. This is now the number one toy in Scandinavia, and the popularity's growing. - It's addictive, isn't it? - Mm hmm, yes, it's kind of like a video game, except this little gadget helps strengthen your hand-eye-coordination, helps with balance and reflexes. Gets your whole body involved, not just your thumbs. - Wow! - I got one in! - Yes, there you go. - Whoa! - But this is is already on the market. What are you suggesting, Caswell? - Alright, guys. - I used to have one of those. - Mm hmm. It's time to get back to basics. In this world of toys with all of the flashing lights, and the electronics, and the licensed characters, let's get creative by simplifying. And this. - Hey! The SSR Tracker. I haven't seen one of these in years. Let me try. - We start a new line of toys, Grandpa's Attic, with eco-friendly materials, simple designs, rather than monkeys hanging from mechanical trees, shooting machine guns. Sometimes you have to go back to move forward. - I like it. - You do? - Let's get all of these drawn up. I want to get these into production right away. - That's great, thank you. - Timing's actually perfect. Our Taiwanese designers are in town. I want you to get with them. - Perfect, when? - Well, they're leaving tomorrow, but let's get you in there this afternoon. - I can't. It's actually my daughter's birthday party. - Oh, that's too bad. But you can reschedule can't you? - Not really. - Janie, come on. I mean, if you're coming back, you really gotta, you know, get your priorities straight. - Hmm, you're right. - Good. Audrey, get Janie set up with the designers. - Audrey, don't bother. - What did you say? - Don't bother. - What's happening? - Thank you so much for the opportunity, but I have a very important meeting. - With who? - My family. I'm taking this. Taxi! - How about a Guide Ride? - Gabe? Get me to LaGuardia fast. - Great job back there. - You heard that? - You bet. And I wasn't the only one. - You mean God? - I told you, when you speak, He listens. - I see now. I have missed so many birthdays, and bedtime stories, loose teeth. I wanna get home. I wanna see my family. - It sounds like you're ready to go back. - I'm sorry, it's actually quicker just to take the- - Oh, Janie. Janie? Janie, you're awake. Oh, thank God. Nurse, nurse. - We're in New York? - Yeah, why wouldn't you be? - Where's Sam? Is Sam here? - You stay here, I'll bring her in. - David, I'm so sorry. - For what? - For everything. I love you so much. - Okay, honey, I love you too. - No, I really, really love you and Sam. Nothing is more important than that. I mean, except God, but that's a given. - Okay. - Don't you see? I got a second chance. - From what? - God. - Okay, maybe you'd better lay down. You did just have a baby. - Baby? - Here she is. - She's still a baby. Hi! - Yeah. Are you sure you're okay? - I've never been better in my whole entire life. Hi. Look at her. - Yeah, she's our little miracle, isn't she? - That's exactly what you are. An amazing little miracle. Will you get me my phone? I need to call work. - Can't it wait? - No, I can't, trust me. Hi, may I speak to Mr. Thompson? Yes, this is Janie Caswell. Thank you. Yes, I can hold. You are so beautiful. Yes you are. Hi, Marcus. Change of plans. I will be taking maternity leave after all. I don't know, a couple months, maybe more. I think we'll just take it day by day. Alright. Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much for understanding. Okay. You know what? We should go visit my dad with all this new free time. - Yeah, Buck would love that. Wow, who are you? - I'm Sam's mom. - Yeah. - Hey, Sam, come over here and get in a picture with your baby brother. - Coming! - Beautiful day, isn't it? - Amen.
