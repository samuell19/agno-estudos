I can remember your silhouette, in the moonlit night. In my dreams, I can see you over and over again. Longing for love, embraced by the nocturne of moonlight. I still remember that scene through the paper door, of my mother with a stranger making love. It felt like I was watching a movie. I watched them, and kept watching, forever... [Director] She won't be out for half an hour. [Director] Hey, stop that! - Find a solution quickly. - I can't do anything either. [Director] You shouldn't be meddling so much. Have you had enough? [Director] Hey! Director! Please come out quickly! We have another scene to shoot, or it'll delay the schedule! Look for yourself; there's a pile of scenes to shoot. Please open the door, okay? Hurry up and open it. Do you have a key? This is the prop car; someone must have the key. Move aside... Director Get me the shot list! How can we set up the camera without it? Hey, block the scene; otherwise, we can't set up the lights. Enough of this. We can't even set up the microphone. Women can be so troublesome. Do you have the determination? If everything could be solved with determination, life wouldn't be so difficult. Listen, Director. If you have any problems, let's discuss it, okay? This won't help at all. Is anyone listening? Hey, Makeup Department! Don't think I didn't hear you; move aside! What's wrong with having determination? Making a movie requires determination. What? Are you a fossil? The '80s are about to end. Is your brain just a lump of meat? - Say it again if you dare. - Meatloaf. Ugly duckling. -What? Meat Loaf - Ugly duckling. Enough with the noise, please. Everyone, say less! Art Department, get out of here, you useless thing. What did you say? Assistant Director, control them. Stop helping the actors with makeup; fix yourself first. Move aside. It's not only you making a film here, idiot. Meatloaf. Ugly duckling. I'm truly sorry. Mr. Inoue, that's your car, right? Left-hand drive must be cool. It's her third time hiding in the car. Is she okay? She's fine. It's her first time filming, so she's nervous. Even though she's a woman, she's working hard. A beautiful female director making an erotic film will surely generate buzz. But... I don't really understand this Japanese filming style. That's understandable since you've worked in the US. [Director] Director! Nice to meet you. I'm Inoue from Falcon Films, in charge of your movie. Debuting at this age, surrounded by veterans, isn't easy. Hey, who are you calling a veteran? -Kaoru, stop it. -You call me a veteran? Falcon is a foreign investment company that rose with the video boom. We're newcomers to the film industry, just like you. In the US, women are breaking barriers. Newcomers like us can do it too. Continuously challenging and creating excellent works, breaking traditions. But we're no match for Americans. We even lost to them in the war. "Creators First" is Falcon Films' motto. Please believe in us. Let's change Japanese cinema together. That's right. Let's change Japanese cinema together, okay? Don't dress so provocatively. Filmmaking is not a game, you know? Alright, let's resume shooting. Next is scene 47. Double the speed. Let's go. Please. Living room scene. You wasted 45 minutes. You're killing your own film. Bro, what do you mean? What? Still acting all high and mighty? Tell me, what's my lover's name? Her name is... Of course, it's Reiko. Where is Brother's lover? you are... Do you doubt me? Doubt? You see... Doubting me? Doubting me? Are you... doubting me? Cut! Director? Mom... Director! Director! I'm sorry. How was that last scene? Is it okay? Yeah, okay. It's okay, this scene is well done. Wait, is that considered "okay"? -The director said so. -It's definitely not okay. Move on to the next scene. Hurry up, we won't be able to sleep tonight if we don't finish in time. Director, are you sure about that? I'm sure, it's okay. The crew is quite intimidating, huh? If you need any help, just let me know. Thank you. I'm thinking about the next scene. Excuse me, I'll take my leave. You have a strong presence. No, not at all. Hello? Learn your lines properly. You're so rude to people. I'm sorry. What's with him? A small-time actor. He's just jealous; you're the star, don't mind him. Director! Where are you going? We're about to start filming. I'm going... to the restroom. We're already four hours behind schedule. What's that? Can you face me? No. Please? This... No. Without this, we can't do that... I don't want it. Just put it on here. Excuse me. What's that? What's going on? -I'm sorry, I haven't... -Haven't you yet? -Come on. -Wear this to film? No way. For a bed scene, you need to cover up. Put it on here, and then wear it at the back. I don't want to. -What's wrong? -This. There was no mention of a Sex scene in the beginning. It was said that there would only be a naude hugging, that's all. Our agency will never allow it. Tomoko, a Nude embrace is considered a bed scene. It's also the selling point of this film. Didn't you say you would ask him to remove his body hair? That's impossible. I can't have sex until the hair grows back. Shinji, it's for work needs... After all, he's a star. I don't need to cover up. Kaede, please stop saying things that make people uncomfortable. Besides, actors didn't use to cover up in the past. Filming a movie requires going all out. Those things only hinder the performance. Such arrogance. You've already become irrelevant. Listen, this line is different from before. You can't be fully naked. Okay? Please, I'm begging you all. I'm relying on you, please. Please. Hey, Mr. Tachibana, come back. Reiko. You are my lover, right? Yes. You are the person I love the most in this world. I feel the same way. Liar. Cut. Sorry, I apologize once again. One more time. -Another sighing part? -Yes. Apologies, only the parts with sighs. Just the sighs? Sighing with others. Scene 16 Camera rolling. Get ready. Action. Cut. Sorry, one more time, please. Director, director, what's wrong this time? How should I put it? I need a little more... Uncertain... - Sadness? A sigh of sadness. - Sadness? Hey, director. - It's the 17th time already. - Yes. There must be a reason, right? A reason? I can't keep shooting and stopping all the time. Unless you buy this movie yourself. You're right. A reason? A reason... The reason for reshooting. - Alright, wait... - Hey, director. Should we shoot or not? If we don't shoot, we'll have to move to the next scene. I still need to set up the microphone. Let's shoot, let's shoot. The reason, right? Wait, hold on... The reason? - The reason is... - Forget it. Sorry, everyone, take a break for ten minutes. Take a ten-minute break. It's okay. This is your movie. The stage door is opening. The boom is passing through. Be careful, push hard, damn it. I said push hard. Alright, stop there. Rest. Done? The assistant director said there's no time to use the boom. Are we falling behind schedule? Check the script. Here. They're bullying the director again. - Be more resolute. - Speak louder. Use your diaphragm to project your voice. Louder. She graduated from an art university. Just graduated from college? We're about to start. - Get ready. - Camera rolling. Action. Delicious, as always. Really? Reiko, I can't forget the taste of the soup you made. Cut. Sorry, one more time. A reason? The steam in the soup isn't enough. Please add more. More steam. There'll only be enough for two more bowls of soup. Is that true? The art department needs to prepare more. Who knows, this scene might be shot 20 times. Alright, fill the soup and then leave. Two more bowls of soup, and that's it. I'm sorry, my apologies. Alright. This is take 21. Action. Camera rolling. Get ready. Action. start Delicious, as always. Really? Reiko, I can't forget the taste of the soup you made. Cut. The steam isn't enough. The soup should be so hot that it's steaming. Sorry. Let's take a break first. Actors, relax. Mr. Tachibana, it looks like we need to call a taxi again. Can't do that. We have to finish before the last tram. We're out of budget. Then find a solution. If... Don't waste time on trivial matters. I can't help it. Director. Let's have a talk. What... what's wrong? You're right. Director, the scene we just shot has nothing to do with the plot, right? Correct. That bowl of soup depicts the conflict between the two brothers, who are rivals in love. Cut it then. Otherwise, your movie won't come together. Disappear like a firework with a bang. Focus on the important scenes. That scene is crucial. Cut it. Understand? Wait. Watanabe. Scene cut, get ready for the meal. Let's eat. - I ordered curry. - I want to eat this one. Sato, hey Sato! Why are you daydreaming, you idiot? Go clean the lens, useless woman. Hey, come and eat. What's going on? - Sorry. - I'll continue eating. This is the highlight. Sorry. Hey, hey, hey, come here. That's right, come over. What's the matter? Come here. What's the matter? How can they cut it? How can they cut it? I rarely act in movies. you promised to strengthen my role. I can't do anything about it either. Please, find a solution quickly. I don't want to lose to that pretty boy. What? Are you jealous of Segawa Shinji? If this movie goes well, you'll be the lead next time. You're kidding. Really. Success depends on this movie. Kaede Sudo first sex scene. Popular actor Segawa Shinji, and you're the third lead. You'll become a star. -Really? - Really. If I succeed, I can act properly. Director! Mr. Okumura. I came to see how the movie is going. Is that so? How's my script? Uh... Thank you for accepting my ideas. Sex scenes are difficult to shoot; they should arouse desire. But the dialogue... it's quite ordinary, right? No, that's not the case. Is that so? I heard you would improvise the dialogue on set. Well... It's okay; the director has the final say anyway. After submitting the script, I won't interfere. Thank you very much. I'm leaving now. But... If you want to change the lines, you should consult with me first. The script is the writer's creation. If you want to cut or change it, let me know first. Didn't you say you wouldn't interfere? Yes, I won't interfere with your shooting style. But it doesn't mean my script can be changed arbitrarily. They all came to bother me... I want to kill them. Director, director! Hey, hey, come here for a moment. We'll start filming in ten minutes. Watanabe, Watanabe, are you free? What's the matter now? Our "Queen" is here again? Hey, hey. hey hey Can you give us a ride to the actor's lounge? - Get in. - Thanks. It's urgent. Let's go. Start the car. Damn it, we're already late. Let me be clear. What? I know you all say I'm a has-been actress. No, how could we dare say that? Enough, I understand it better than anyone else. So, this movie is my chance to make a comeback. Of course, we understand, Kaeda. You're so pure, Director. What... what's wrong? Take a good look. Look! I'm an actress. This is my body. I want you to see it clearly, Director. I want you to remember it well. Tomorrow's sex scene must be a success. "Has-been actress has to strip for attention." I don't want to hear such talk. Do you understand, Director? Understood. Understood. Any problem? No. One more thing. What else? For tomorrow's bed scene with Shinji, I want it to be real. What? I'll be more immersed that way. Are you saying there won't be a rehearsal or a test... No, I mean it should be real. What do you mean by "real"? Can't you understand? Sex scene, making love. I want you to convince Shinji. Okay, live scenes will only have the director, actors, and cameraman, any issues? Wait a minute. I heard this is quite common abroad. Then it's settled. Ozaki, show them out. Alright. See you. Take care. Now what? What do we do? Wait, don't tell me you'll do what she said. If making love can improve the actor's performance, it's worth considering. Are you kidding? This is Japan. We can't film such scenes; it's not a porn movie. Absolutely not. What if someone has an STD? Should I tell Shinji's agency, "The actress wants it to be real"? - Should I ask them? - No, don't. Just cover their private parts and pretend to do it. Understand? Wait a moment. Tomorrow, we'll be filming the most critical scene of this movie. I want to shoot a beautiful and shocking sex scene. Director, listen carefully. Tomorrow, the film inspector will come. If they catch us, we're done for. Film inspector? Alright, let's pull it up. Pull it up, pull it up straight. Okay. Mr. Gonzo is surprisingly energetic. When there's a bed scene, that old man's back to life. Hey, Gonzo. Mr. Gonzo. What? Why are you calling me? Damn it, can't you see I'm busy? Why are you working so hard? In a Sex scene, you have to bring out the beauty of the actress's skin. As a cameraman, you should know that, right, Yagi? Too bright or too dark won't work, It requires a perfect balance. The microphone also, not too far or too close. Yes, that's right. But... Yagi, haven't you heard? Heard what? Oh... So you haven't heard. Please, you must remove the hair, I beg you. I said no. I don't want to remove my pubic hair. Please. It's crucial for this scene. I don't think it's necessary. It's just not worth it at all. Hey, it's different what you promised. I told you I wanted to do it for real. What? What do you mean, for real? Miss Sudo, what do you mean? -It's none of your business, nosy lady. -I'm his agent. It hurts so much. Are you really an actor? Love making scenes require complete dedication, Including emotions... For real? In front of everyone? Are you crazy? We just need to pretend. You're not an actor at all. What are you doing? How dare you slap my face? Damn it, Director! Where's the director? Give me a break. Go away, go away. What's going on? What's wrong? Why isn't the lighting technician present during the sex scene? Then who will handle the lighting? Gonzo? Who will handle the sound? Don't come in just for moaning sounds. Let me explain to you, okay? That's enough, that's enough. mind your own business. Mr. Kawai? Are you okay? Are you injured? I apologize for showing you this scene. Everyone, this is our visitor. He came specifically to participate in today's shooting. Michio Kawai, Japanese film censor. Movie censor? Our director, Hanako. I am Hanako. I am Kawai, Is this your first film? Congratulations. Thank you. Please give me your guidance. I know you have a lot to say, but do me a favor and hold back for now. If the film censor focuses on us, the movie will be finished. Don't leave me. You betray me? Forgive me, I fell in love with him. I can't forgive that. You acted really well. He's my brother. - Forgive me. - It's impossible. I'll never leave you. Don't go. I can't... Betray my brother. Don't do this. Tatsuhiko... No… You did a great job. Cut. Okay. Alright, this scene is done. Thanks for your hard work. Miss Kaeda, you are amazing. You perfectly portrayed the pain of forbidden love. It was so powerful. Really? Thanks to your script. It express metaphorically the loss of love through involuntary vulnerability. That's the reason why I wanted to act in this movie. Thank you very much. Ms. Kaeda your performance is incredibly soulful. You have a powerful presence on the big screen. It's truly astonishing. It's full of soul. Mr. Kawai it's impressive, isn't it? What's that? It symbolizes the impact and sorrow of losing a loved one, leading to urinary incontinence. So, it's public urination? Peeing? It's not the same. A woman urinating in public, not in a bathroom, is considered public urination. According to the Film Ethical Agreement, Chapter 5, Article 3, which includes descriptions of sexuality and sexual services, including full nudity, partial nudity, and clothed sexual activities, it can't be classified as a general audience film. Those below middle school age require parental accompaniment. Wait a moment. What's the matter? Director, I'm sorry, but that scene needs to be reshot. Why? For the public urination scene. Public urination? It doesn't have any sexual implications; it portrays her love for her significant other... It represents a love that endures even if she has to let go of someone important. I don't want to interfere, but that scene must be cut. Otherwise, it'll be restricted for those below middle school age. Meaning Sengawa Shinji's fans won't be able to watch it, and it can't be rented out on video either. You know who our primary sponsor is, right? Falcon Pictures. They are a video company. They earn money from videos, not movies. If it's categorized as an adult film due to age restrictions, it won't make any profit. Alright. I'm sorry. We need to reshoot that scene. But it was shot well just now. How should we shoot it? The cameras have been taken down. - The lighting too, - And the microphones. I'm sorry, but... Please, I'm begging you. What's the reason? The reason... The reason is... The reason is... No, not again. The reason is... Apologize. - Ota, - no, I've had enough. Kneel down and apologize to me. If you don't apologize, there won't be a Cemera department. Please, I'm asking you. Hey, bring back the cameras and set them up again. It's your last chance. Disgusting. Why are you so ruthless? Why do we have to be so heartless when making a movie? Right? Yes. But... no one can help her. Director, what's going on? You just praised my acting. Miss Kaeda, please reshoot it one more time. This time... No urination. What are you saying? It's crucial for this movie. Please, no. Please, then... Cut it out. Without the pissing part, it loses its meaning. Cut the whole scene. Step aside. I'm sorry. We have to cut this scene. What? Cut it again? Set in place. There was a tube installed to create a urination effect, but it got cut, and filming was interrupted. Filming a movie is such a hassle. Everyone is too dedicated. No, we won't finish soon. Alright, goodbye. Hey, why are filmmakers so difficult to deal with? Their fashion sense is terrible, and they smell bad too. Yeah, they're stuck in the past. It's kind of pathetic. Next time, I'll find you a popular TV series. You'll wear Italian clothes, drive foreign cars, and act alongside W. Asano. Promise me. I'll turn you into a superstar. The agency would love that too. Don't touch that. I just want to help you. No need. Why not ask for some help? I can handle it myself. Step aside. Please move. Seeing her work so hard, does it touch you? I don't want to lose to someone as frivolous as you. No manners, which talent agency is he from? Forget it. What do you mean? I'm an actor, and this is how I make a living. An actor? We don't need stars here; we need actors. Whatever. In other words, I can't lose to an idol like you. Sorry. Excuse me, we need a little more time. Please wait in the dressing room. I want to go play video games. What's wrong with him? He's so uncivilized. Ignore him. How can we? Where is he from? Let it go. Thank you. I brought her here. Hey, the director. Hope it's not bad news again. About the next scene with rain. No, listen to me. I need rain. Rain is crucial. We're behind schedule and over budget, please compromise a bit. For the sake of the movie. For the movie? This is too much. Creating fake rain will set us back even more. No. I'm the director, and you'll listen to me. The director? Why didn't you act like one before? Always asking for this and that. Have you considered our schedule and budget? Do you think I'm Doraemon? I can't solve every problem. I'm sorry. But rain is essential for this movie. Anyway, no rain, find a way yourself. No, no. Rain is crucial for this movie. Rain is important. Please, rain is essential. I've worked in this studio for a long time. I've seen many new directors like you. It's okay, no need to apologize. Cry if you want to, Even though a director is an adult, they also cry out loud. All that talk about outstanding scripts and directorial talent... All those talents they say a director needs are bullshit. How to mediate, how to compromise. has nothing to do with talent. Only those who know how to compromise can survive. Idiot. When will you finally learn? I'm sorry. Save it. Apologizing won't change a thing. Damn it. First, talk about the script. - Have you even read it? - I'm sorry. I didn't read it, just took it for granted. Women aren't cut out to be part of the camera crew. Enough with the fuss. Which department are you from? Art department. Right? We create the world in movies. What color flowers suit this movie's world? Red. - Right? - Red, red. - All red, got it? - All red. - All red. - Yes, to fit this world. Understand the script? Go buy red flowers. All red ones, hurry. Damn it, it's 1.5 millimeters. Otherwise, the atmosphere won't be right. Hey. What color is that? This is not a cabaret. Stop revealing your personal life, okay? Be more professional. We're making a movie. Hey. what? What's so great about movies? What's so great about acting? Yeah. When I'm an actor, that's when I feel like myself. Only when I'm portraying someone else, I feel alive. It's only when I'm playing a character that I feel real. The real me... is not meant for others to see. I am a walking lie. - And you, it's showtime. - Okay. Actor... What's wrong? Shinji... He's grown up. - His coat can't be wrinkled. - Let's go to Discall - I can't work with him in those clothes. - Let's go to Discall. After all, this is movie. Makeup is essential. Costumes too. Sound as well. Speak softly. We're dubbing, so you need to sound more like an actress. Okay. Action. Okay, we're done. Lunchtime. Go get some food. This place... It's my favorite spot. What a coincidence. I like it here too. Hey. Do you mind if I sit here? Not at all. Do you want to eat? This... It's like a viewing window. I've loved looking at things this way since I was a kid. The world outside the donut is amazing, right? Really. I want to present that world through the movie, I want to capture that world on film. It's time to film the climax of this movie. My movie will be fantastic. I'm genuinely happy for you. Stay positive. My camera's broken. Start filming. Scene 87, Take 1 - Prepare - Action! Scene 87, Take 1 Start filming. I will give up everything for love. So will I. Love conquers all. Cut! Out of focus. Sorry, let me touch up my makeup. I'll change my phone number. - Start filming - Scene 2 - Prepare - Action! Start filming. I will give up everything for love. So will I. Love conquers all. Wait, sorry, pause. Seiji, let's talk. I can't emotionally invest in this if you continue like this. I want you to embody your character. It's too difficult. I know you can do it. If you're not satisfied, then let me get into character. Start filming. Scene 3, Take 1 - Prepare - Action! Start filming. I will give up everything for love. So will I. Love conquers all. No, no, no. This won't do. The cover is coming off the obscuring object. Then don't cover it. I'll just go for it. Director, can we continue? No, wait, what's going on? Shut up. Seiji, just watch me act. But the company doesn't allow... I don't care. Please. I've never felt this comfortable before. Mr. Tachibana, how will you handle this? Handle what? You know it's forbidden to show nudity in our country. Let alone age restrictions, it's considered "harmful." How is this movie harmful? According to the Film Ethics Agreement, Chapter 5, Article 8, depictions of sex and sexual services... See that? You've violated it. You've violated the inclusion of explicit content and other depictions." We'll censor it later, so let us film. Alright, I'll pretend I didn't see it. Agent Miss, let him do his thing. Scene 4, Take 1 - Prepare - Action! Start filming. I love you, Tatsuhiko. I love you too, Tatsuhiko. Reiko, your expression is excellent. So beautiful. A butt crack is visible. - Problem with the butt? - Butt? That's the official term for it. I see. She wiggled her butt three times. Under 18 can't watch. Cut! What's wrong? We're still filming. No, this isn't right. What's not right? The director didn't call "Cut." Hey, pass me the reflector. Thunder effect. We'll add the dialogue later. Wait, are you all crazy? Keep going. Reiko, I love you. I'm the director here. I'm the producer. My word is final. Mr. Tachibana. - You just don't understand. - What? You're killing this movie. When I was making movies, you were still in diapers. A movie with no audience is meaningless. Hey, Assistant Director, reshoot. What? Take a break, Everyone, take a break. Mr. Tachibana, they say the atmosphere on set isn't great. It's common during movie shoots. As a patron, we feel that some changes need to be made. Your progress is falling behind, and the movie's rating is also a concern. The audience wants to see Miss. Kaede nude and the sex scene with Segawa Shinji. It shouldn't be that difficult to film. Please come in. Sorry. Director, what are you doing here? I asked her to come. I want to discuss openly how to improve this movie. But I am the producer. Mr. Tachibana... You have lost the ability to produce. I'm sorry. Director, how do you think we should proceed with the filming? Well, I... I want to take the time to film the scene between Miss. Kaede and Mr. Shinji. And what about the movie rating? An R-rating is unavoidable. I believe artistic expression is the most important. Are you still insisting on the rain scene at the end of the movie? Yes, rain is essential. Mr. Tachibana, let's change the director. We won't mistreat your efforts. Please rest assured. It's a common practice in foreign countries; there's no need to worry. Wait a minute! Didn't you say that the creators come first? Only creators whose works can make money count. So, now, Let the assistant director take over. He seems capable. I'll go to the set later. Wait! What's wrong? Please let her continue as the director. After all, this is her first film. Though it may take more time and effort, I want her to direct it. This movie only needs Segawa Shinji's fans Miss. Kaede's cleavage. Who the director is doesn't matter. I remember your shadow on a night in June, in my dreams, I can see you over and over again. Longing for love, accompanied by a nocturne of moonlight. Take this ticket and watch the movie. Aren't you coming, Mom? Go ahead. That day, while I was watching the movie, my mother disappeared. When I returned home, raindrops were falling. Drip, drop, they fell. Hey, you must know how important that scene is, right? So, how are we going to handle it? Alright, let's go all out! Just kidding. I have the director's notes. Now I am the director. I will explain, I will explain to all of you. It's about the conflict of love and betrayal, you and him, confronting each other with a knife. Shinji Be careful. If he gets hurt, he won't be able to act with Asano in the future. Be careful. careful Your motivation is instinctive. You get chased a bit, get stabbed a few times, and then you fall. Camera, come here. Can I add a line? Sorry. According to the script, this scene requires full nudity, right? But please help us avoid an R-rating. Going to run away? Is that really you? What about creativity? Didn't you say you love movies? when i was ten I often saw my mother doing that. "Do that"? Then my mom ran off with that guy. Sometimes people give up their loved ones for love. That's the movie I want to make. Then why aren't you making it? How should I make it? I've been replaced. Then just let them control you forever. Anyway, I won't let them win. Alright, if all departments are ready, stand by, Starting from Watanabe's first shot, and let's give it our all. Wait! What's the matter? Please explain why you changed the director, or I can't act. Let me explain to you. The previous director couldn't perform her duties, so i replaced her. Duties? Perform? You're treating the movie as if it's a business. You've got it all wrong. A movie is a commodity. You make money when the movie sells, and you gain fame and fortune. You're wrong. Where am I wrong? Movies… Movies should be made with passion and dedication. Shinji, It seems all of you have got it wrong. This is a business. Before talking about how movies should be, let's work first. I'm the one paying you. Director, start shooting quickly. No, it's not like that. It has always been my dream to direct a movie. That's why I've been an assistant director for so long, but... It's not like that. Movies aren't just about money. No wonder you couldn't become a director. The howls of a bereaved dog, This saying is widely known in America too. how old are you? You're this old and still like this? I doubt you'll ever make a movie. Are you going to duel with your competitors? Hey, you! Duel with whom? Nonsense. Making movies is not like going to war. Besides, just because you pay us doesn't mean we're your slaves. As Watanabe said, we make movies not just for money. You've been fired, you... No need to say anything, I quit! Alright, everyone, let's continue shooting. You're not the director; you've been fired. This is my movie. I am the director. Watanabe, keep shooting. Seize this opportunity. Take it. Give it back to you. Director... Opportunity, I will fight for it myself. What are you doing? Hurry up! Continue shooting. Director is back. Pick up the pace. It's the final scene. Let it rain. Rain? That's impossible to achieve. Set, prepare for rain. Stop it, leave me alone! Stop it! If you don't listen... Hey, stop it, stop it! Mr. Ota get ready to set up the camera. You idiot! The boss said not to shoot anymore. Let's go. But everyone is putting in effort. You fool! They're from Hollywood. Do you want to lose your job? Now go. Then I'll take over filming. What's a woman doing here? Shut your mouth! Get out of here! Mr. Kaneko, activate the crane. Good, bring it down, bring it down. You want to get shot in the head? What's so funny? Regardless of gender, anyone can take great shots. I've always believed that. The shots you take lack taste. Alright, let's resume shooting. All of you are fired. Fired, fired, fired. Fired. Fired, fired, fired. Except for the actors, everyone is fired. - Um... - I'm sorry. That's why we can't give up on making movies. Step aside. I've been wanting to tell you about your car, it's really tasteless. Alright, I'll take full responsibility. Everyone, let's make the best movie ever. Okay, close the stage door. Prepare for rain. The cameraman is ready. The lights are ready. Let it rain. Since that day, whenever it rains, I remember my mother in a certain city, feeling the tiny droplets falling from the sky just like me. This gentle rain keeps falling forever in my dreams. I have... fallen in love with you. As an actress, Or as a woman? Feng's identity. I love you too. The movie is fantastic. Alright, start filming. Action! Get ready. Action! I love you. I love you too. I'm so happy. So happy… Very good, feed me more. Shinji. It feels great. Movies... are truly wonderful. Come with me. Let's walk to the end of love. Kaeda.. Perfect. I remember your silhouette on a June night. In my dreams, I can see you over and over again. Longing for love, under the Moonlight Sonata, I pray in the rain, hoping my wishes will come true. Only love will last forever in this script. Lost and searching for this Moonlight Nocturne. Now, this gentle rain falls upon me. Oh God, please make my dreams come true. Even if one day everything comes to an end, In the movie, I can see you over and over again. Longing for love, under the Moonlight Sonata.
