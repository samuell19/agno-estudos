(epic instrumental music) (upbeat music) (school bell ringing) - Hey man, where you get the box? - (indistinct) whatever I need. - Very nice. - Ready to make some money? - Let's do it. - All right. Yo, little brother. Let me show you how to play this game. - Me? - Yeah, you. You got any money? - Me? - Yeah, you. - Nah. I can't play. All I got is my lunch money-- - [Miles] That'll do. Alrighty, let's play. (boy grunts) - Uh-oh. - [Miles] We made some real money, man. - All right. You all get yellow slips on your very first day. - Me? - Yes, you too. It's never too early to learn a lesson, even on your first day of school. Now Stoneman, looks like you'll never learn. Hmm? And no radios at this school. Robinson, you come along with me. Frank Robinson, what is the matter with you? I thought you had better things to do than get yourself sent to discipline class on your very first day of school. I'm really disappointed in you. Your mother's going to be called in about this. And you know that we have rules against gambling. Who are you? - I'm Steve Grenowski. I'm the new teacher. I'm supposed to see a Ned Wright. - I'm Mr. Wright. Wait here. Come with me. (phone ringing) Well, I've been going over your records. Sit down. And they're certainly not great. What are you? Some sort of activist? - Well yeah. We started a free school and we started the Saturday morning breakfast program and teacher's union. - Well the only reason you're here is because we lost a teacher at the very last minute. You haven't spent two consecutive years in a single school. - I guess I like variety. - Fine. Then I guess you'll like teaching discipline class. - What is that? - When a kid misbehaves or will distract the other students he is sent to D class. First time is just a warning. The second time his parents are called in. And the third time he's suspended for one week. My system is to teach those students that can be saved. - I don't wanna be a jailer. - Understand something Mr. Grenowski. This is a tough neighborhood. I know because I grew up here. But I came back because I care about these kids. Used to be only one out of five went on to graduate from high school. One out of five. Now it's more than half and it's because my system works. You'll understand it better after you've been here for a while. - Sounds like fun. - Ah, Mr. Robinson. Would you show Mr. Grenowski the way to discipline class, room 102, since you're both going there? - So, how do you like school? - Great. (school bell rings) (students chattering) - This is a nice school. All right, everybody. Take a seat. Be quiet. Get comfortable. Take your seat. Thank you. My name is Steve. Steve Grenowski. And yes I will spell that for you. (students giggling) Now I would like to get to know all of you just like I'm sure all of you would like to get to know me. What's your name? - Me? - [Steve] Yeah, you. - They call me Tiny. - Is this your first day in D class? - [Tiny] Me? - You realize you say me a lot? - No, Mr uh... - My name is Mr. Grenowski but you can call me Mr. Green if that makes you more comfortable. And this may be my first day in D class and my first day in your school but this is not my first time in front of a classroom. I know all of you think everything is very different here but I'm here to tell you things are not different here. In fact, most things here are pretty much the same as they are everywhere else. (whoopee cushion squelches) What's your name? - Lydell. - Lydell, have you ever been in D class before? - Yeah. - Yeah? What's it like in D class? - Boring! - It's boring, huh? Why is it boring? - 'Cause there's nothing to do. I mean, it's like punishment. Like doing time. - All right, we'll just have to find some way to make it interesting. Someway other than our little friend here. Actually, I think he's kinda cute. All right, let's get on with it. (books clattering) (students laughing) Well, nobody's perfect. That's why I'm in D class. (upbeat music) - Principal called me to tell me that you are in D class the first day of school. Is that right? - Yep. - Don't yep me, Frank. How could you do that? - I didn't mean to get into D class. - But you did. Why do you think I'm working so hard? Now don't you want an education so you can make a better life for yourself? - Sure I do. - Then you have to try hard. It's not just gonna happen. Do you understand me? - Yes. - I gotta meet some friends to go to a Neighborhood Watch meeting. I won't be late. Dinner's in the refrigerator and I want you to do your homework and the dishes. Do you understand that? - I will. I know not to mess with the-- - You know not to... You know not to mess with me. No more D class, okay? - Yes, ma'am. (upbeat music) (student yawning) (fingers tapping) (student yawns) (school bell rings) - Have fun playing by yourself. (bright music) (students applauding) - [Steve] Hey. - Hi, I'm here to join the chess team. - Yeah, yeah. Hey, you got the right place. Come on in, come on in. I'm Steve Grenowski. I don't think I know you. - I'm Lucy Hill. I've never been in D class. Isn't anyone else gonna join? - Oh, hey. I'm sure a lot of kids wanna join the chess team, yeah. - Are we gonna play chess? - [Steve] Well, do you know how? - Yes. Do you? - Yeah, I know how. Come on. Sit down. (upbeat music) (students chattering) (door squeaks) - Hi, Mom. - [Mrs. Robinson] Frank, what happened? - What? Oh Mom, I was just playing ball. - Oh. - Come on, Mom. It's not that-- - Sit over there. (Frank sighs) And take off that sweatshirt. Give me that. You've been hanging around that Miles Stoneman. - Ouch! Mom! - Frank, the summer is over. It is time for you to get back to your schoolwork. - Mom, it hurts. - It'll hurt worse if you don't stay out of trouble. (school bell ringing) - Where's the rest of the team? - They'll be here. They'll be here. - [Miles] Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out. Where is it? (Miles grunts) - I win again! - Okay, that's all right, that's all right. You got your money, man? You wanna play? - Yeah, I got a dollar. - All right, I'll put mine down there. Put your money down. - All right, yeah. - All right. Check it out. Watch it. Now there it is. There it is. Where'd it go, where'd it go, where'd it go, where'd it go? Mm-mm-mm. Where is it? - Right here. - Sorry. Sad story, brother. Thank you. You got any more money? Wanna play again? - [Student] Nah. Come on, let's go. - Yo Lydell, bring some more men in here, man. - All right. Uh-oh. - Well, well, well. What's going on in here? - Nothing, Mr. Grenowski. - Gonna get another yellow slip. - My mom will kill me if she hears from Mr. Wright again. - All right, what do you say we play my money against your time? - How much you got? - I got $20. What do you say my $20 against two months of your time after school on my chess team. - Two months, two years. It don't make no difference. It's easy money. You got it. - Good. - Let me show you. When it stops, you're going down. This is the ace of spades. Follow the ace like this. Look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it. Oh, mm! Where is it? - Looks like I win. Gee, that's fun. See you guys after school. You guys are very good at games. You should be great on my chess team. You're not trying to hide, are you? - Me? - Yeah, you. I'll see you after school too. And you and you and you. Oh, well. Come on in. Oh, come on. Come on. Why don't you just take a seat back there in those chairs and get comfortable. - This is the chess team. - [Steve] Yeah. - Looks more like a hit team. - [Steve] (giggles) Yeah. - Good luck, Lucy. - [Miles] I told you there was the bush league, man. I told you. - All right, all right. Listen up, listen up. Now we or you are going to become Central Junior High School's first chess team. - How we gonna do that? - Thought we might start by learning how to play chess. How many of you know how to play, besides Lucy? - Chess is for girls and chumps, man. - Uh-uh. Get it straight. Chess is a game of strategy. In order to win at chess you have to concentrate, you have to think straight. It's like a battle except the chess board's your battle field. And there are rules. - There's always rules. I may have to be here for two months but that don't mean I have to like it. - Miles, do you have a question? - No. - Does anyone have a question? - Yeah, how do you win? - There you go, a good point. Lucy, why don't you help me set up the board. - Turn your chairs around. (chill music) - In order to win at chess you have to capture the other team's king. Now the interesting thing about that is the king's really the weakest piece on the board. I mean, you can only like move forward one space at a time. The strongest piece is the lady queen. Now the queen, she can move like all the way up the board and back. And the pawn is this little piece here. It can only inch forward like one space at a time except for the very first move of the game. The pawn has the option to move two spaces. I want you guys just to, you know, play a couple of games, see how you like it, and then we'll switch up. - How does the pope move? - (sighs) It's not a pope. It's a bishop. And it moves like this. - How are you guys doing? You know the difference between the way a quarterback moves and halfback moves, don't you? A game of chess is like a game of football. Pawns are like the linemen. They protect the backfield, the pieces on the back of the board. The rook, the rook can go straight down the field all the way. The bishop can cut across the field like a wide receiver. The knight swings wide like a halfback. - Okay, I'll make my move. (Steve laughs) - Not quite, Lydell. I appreciate your enthusiasm but that's not quite the way it's done. Why don't you show them, Lucy? Good move. Miles, maybe you counter with that. And now, Frank, it's up to you. Good move. That was a good move. - Frank, you ready to split, man? - Nah, I'm gonna finish up this game. - Checkmate. (Steve laughs) - All right, that's about it for today, guys. Good game. Your folks will be worried about you. You better get home. - Yeah, better luck next time. - You can't beat her. - [Lydell] Yeah, but you can't beat me. - [Tiny] I can beat you. (Lydell scoffs) - Mr. Green, could I-- - Borrow a chessboard? Yeah go ahead. - Thanks. - Yeah. - See you tomorrow. - Uh-huh. (chill music) - [Frank] Mate. (school bell rings) I want a rematch. - [Lucy] You wanna lose again? - All right. - I wanna play. - All right, break it up. Break it up, I say. What's going on here? - What do you think of your chess team? - What chess team? - Your chess team. - My office, Mr. Grenowski, and now. - Ooh! - Mr. Grenowski, just what is it you're trying to do? - I'm trying to start a chess team. - At Central, our first concern is education. We don't have time for games. - It's not a game. Come on. Chess is a learning experience. The kids learn a lot from chess. - For instance? - For instance how to think, how to concentrate, how to focus on a problem, think it through to its solution. It'll help them with their schoolwork. - You think so? - I know so. - All right. Go ahead but I predict it won't work. - Well, with all respect sir, I'd like the chance to prove you wrong. - [Ned] All right, you got that chance. (school bell rings) (upbeat music) (Lucy laughs) - Check. (all laugh) - You let her beat you again. - You play her then. I'd like to see you. (Lucy laughs) - [Lucy] Let's play it again. - Come on. - Let's play. - All right. We've got our first match with another school tomorrow if you want it. - Oh yeah! - We're ready! - Now wait a minute. Don't be too quick here. It's with Greenview Prep. - A private school? - We could take View. - We'd never beat them. - We can beat anybody. - Well see, they had another school cancel at the last minute and they've got an open spot so we can play them tomorrow if we want. Well, if you want. But you might lose. - We won't lose. - Please. - We'll kill those suckers. - No way. - All right. All right then. Tomorrow afternoon meet me in the parking lot by my car, the green one, and we'll see about that. All right, okay, okay, okay! Let's go, let's go, let's go. You guys feel like winning? Huh, huh, huh? - Yeah! - You got schoolbooks, right Tiny? - Of course I do, Green. What do you think? - I won't answer that. Let's go. Go, go. Get in the car. - Hey, Green. Who gets shotgun? - [Steve] The best player, first board. And that's Miss Lucy. - I got window, man. (all bickering) - There's room for everyone back there. There's room for everyone. (brakes squeal) (upbeat music) - [Tiny] Hey, this looks like my neighborhood. - [Lydell] I've been to your house and it don't look like this. (all laugh) - My rating's 1250, what's yours? - This team isn't rated yet. - Well, good luck. - It'll be all right. (clocks ticking) - [Chess Player] Checkmate. - [Chess Player Two] Checkmate. - Checkmate. Nice game. Let me explain where you went wrong. - The only thing I did wrong was not winning. - On the contrary. From the very beginning, and with your lack of confidence and your obvious inexperience, you missed my strategy by reacting too fast. (fist thuds) (student groans) - Was that too fast for you, sucker? - My nose! - Uh-oh. - [Chess Player Three] Oh, my nose! - I told you this would happen. - One kid lost his head. I promise it won't happen again. - No it won't because that was your very first and your last match. - Give them a chance. Look how hard they've worked. They're learning from each other. I can see it. - Learning what? To debate with their fists? - All right, Miles lost his head, he hit the other kid, that was wrong, he shouldn't have done it. Don't punish the whole team for that. Come on. They've worked so hard. Look at their grades. Come on, huh? The kids that were getting Ds and Fs are now getting Cs and Bs. - I see you've come with ammunition. - Yeah, I have. (sirens wailing) - You really care about these kids, don't you? - Yeah, I do. Don't they deserve to be cared about? - Of course they do. All right. The grades get you one more chance. But anymore problems and that is the end. You know what I mean, Mr. Green? - Checkmate. (Lucy scoffs) - I don't believe it. Good game, Frank. - All right! Say hello to your new first board. - [Tiny] Congratulations. - [Lydell] Nice going, Frank. - All right, everybody. Listen up. - Hey Green, I beat Lucy. - And I beat Greenview Prep. (students laughing) - Oh, you think that's funny? You think you won something 'cause he won a fight? You didn't win anything. Come on, those people think you're losers. The only way you're gonna prove them wrong is by beating them at their own game. All right. All right. Look, I got some from the games. We'll go over them. Miles, we'll start with your game. - Why me? - Because you gotta learn from your mistakes, Miles. - Don't be telling me nothing. - Look Miles, if you hadn't lost your temper, we wouldn't be in this mess! - Hey man! I don't need this! I served my time. I don't owe you nothing. I'm out of here. (chess pieces clattering) Hey Frank. Time's paid up, man. Why you playing those stupid games? - 'Cause we're getting good at it. - And you guys all lost too. It's not our game. I got bigger and better games, man. Games that make us some real money. - And probably get us in D class again or worse. - Forget D class and forget your chess team. I'm on my way. - Ah Mom, I hate this. - Oh Frank, it'll just be another minute. Hold on. (doorbell rings) Just a minute. Oh, hi. - Hi. I'm Lucy. I'm here to pick up a couple of dresses for my mother. - Oh, come on in. I'm almost finished with one of them. - Frank. You know, blue is your color. (chuckles) - Oh, you know each other. - Yeah. - We're on the chess team together. - You are? - Yes. Frank's first board. That means he's the best player. - How about a game right now? - No, not right now. I'm not finished. Just hold your horses, okay? (Lucy giggles) - Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

Just get them ready. - I will. - Couch Grenowski, to what do you attribute the success of an intercity school like Central in winning this tournament for the first time? - Oh, no doubt about it. We never would've been able to do it without the confidence and support of Ned Wright here. - [Reporter] Mr. Wright, as principal of Central Junior High, how do you account for your team's success? - Hard work and discipline. - Thank you. Can I get a picture of the two of you shaking hands? - Mate. - Wait a second. Now you're the real first board, aren't you? - Yep. - I don't believe it. I don't believe it. - We'll discuss it. I'll see you later. Well, well. If it ain't the chess chump. - Who's a chump? I know you ain't talking to me. - That's right. I saw y'all on TV. - Yeah, we won. - You win any money? - We got a trophy. - Try spending a trophy. The pros don't draft chess players. - We won, man. We're good. I'm good. - If you're so good you should be able to make some money with it. - How? (Miles laughs) - Oh, Uncle Miles will show you how. Excuse me, sweetheart. I have some business to discuss with my man here. It's real simple. Real simple. Yeah. (school bell rings) - All right, now somebody answer me. Where's Frank? He hasn't been to practice in two days. - Maybe he's sick. - I saw him in school today. - He's too good for us. - Checkmate. (Miles laughs) - You sure that was the one? - Sure, nothing. - You fellas wanna try it again? - No more. - Mr. Grenowski, can I talk to you for a moment? Do you know where your first board is? - No, not exactly. - Well I think I do. I just got word that one of our students has been playing chess in the park for money and doing quite well. - Frank. - [Ned] With the help of his friend Miles. - Oh no. - I think I can help. - Checkmate. - Anybody else? - You think I can get a game? - [Miles] It's a free country. - Thanks a lot, brothers. Thanks a lot. (upbeat music) (man groans) - (laughs) All right! Okay. You wanna raise your stakes, win back your losses? - Sure. How much? - How much you got? - Let's see here, fellas. About 100 bucks. - Woo! All right. Let's play. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You're gonna have to put up some money before you play me. - We don't have this kind of money, Miles. - I know but I know where we can get it. - Where? Uh-uh, man. No. - It'll be a short-term loan. You haven't lost yet. We'll win it right back. - Well, okay. I'll do it. - All right. That's my man, Frank. Yes. - I'll be right back. (door squeaks) (dog barking) (sirens wailing) (chill music) - Checkmate. (man laughs) Thanks for the games, fellows. - I lost all my money. - Half of those winnings were mine. - I gotta get it back. I want a rematch. - Oh, I'll probably just beat you again. You're not good enough, son. - What do you mean? I'm good. - Yeah, yeah. You are good. But you are not good enough. For instance, Leonard. He didn't try to knock out Hearns in the first round. Son, you got a great attack but you don't have any patience. You got a lot to learn. - But-- - What, son? - Oh, nothing. Nothing you'd understand. (bright jazzy music) (sirens wailing) - Frank? Frank, you better get up. You're gonna be late for school. I have your breakfast ready. (dog barking) - You never quit. You always have this like keep fighting, stay aggressive. Hi. - Hi. - Missed ya. - Yo man, don't you know we got to get ready for the nationals? - I know. - We've been busting our brains, Frank. What's the matter with you? Don't you even care about us? - I'm sorry. - You oughta be, Frank Robinson. - Well now, the main thing is we're glad you're back. Just in time to meet our new master. - Master? - Yeah, we got us a chess master to help us get ready for the tournament. Mr. Wright's bringing him up now. - [Lydell] Who is he? - Well... - Well, boys and girls, this is a chess master from our own neighborhood and he's agreed to help prepare our team with the nationals. Meet Mr. Oscar LaPointe. - Hi. - Hi. - Oscar was the top player in the state and at one time he was 20th nationally, right? - All right, have fun. - Thank you. - Can we talk a minute, Frank? Oscar, why don't you just take over? - All right. What's your name, young man? - [Tiny] Oh, my name's Tiny. - [Oscar] Thank you. - Oscar wanted me to give this to you. Thought you might wanna pay it back to whoever you borrowed it from. What's he talking about? - I took it. I stole it from my mom. - Why? - I was winning. I didn't think I'd lose it. - So you stole it? - I thought I was borrowing it. - [Steve] That's not how you borrow something. - I know. - Well, so what are you gonna do? - Give it back right away. - Well, I mean this is none of my business, but that isn't enough. I mean, come on, Frank. You gotta make it right with your mom. Now you gotta tell her about it. - I know. - Do you need some help? - I'll be all right. - All right, all right. Go on back over there with the others and see if you can learn something. - Thanks. - Yeah. - [Oscar] In size of this one, there must be thousands of openings and they give you a variety use of the different pieces to see how... You ready to learn something, Frank? - I think I already have. - Good. Are we ready to win the nationals? - [Students] Yeah! - All right. Now it's gonna be different there. You're gonna be playing people like university prep from New York City. When they get on the chess board, they smile a lot. (chill music drowns out Oscar) Like I said, there's an opening. - Hi, Mom. We're going to the nationals. We've got this new coach. He's a master and he's really great. He used to live here in the neighborhood. His names' Oscar LaPointe. You ever heard of him? Well anyway, I got this slip here I need you to sign for school. - We gotta talk. - But first I have to tell you something. - What? - I took your money. - I know that. - But I got it right back. - It's too late. - What do you mean? - I mean stealing is wrong and you can't go. - But Mom, you've gotta let me go. It's the nationals. - You gotta pay the price. You just can't do wrong and get away with it. Now that's one lesson I want you to learn. - Mom, I'm sorry. You've gotta let me go. Just punish me another way. I know I did wrong. - I hope so, Frank. I hope this helps you remember. (chill music) (door slams) - Let's hit the road. - How can we go without Frank? - We're gonna lose so bad. - Hey Frank. - Hey, what's happening? - What's going on, man? Man, you don't need them turkeys anyway. I told you chess is for chumps. - Yeah, you did. - Hey Frank, I got something happening real good tonight. Quick, easy, and out safe fast. - Yeah? What? - I tell you what. I'll come by your house later on tonight and tell you about it. - Yeah, all right. - All right? Check with you later. - [Ned] Well, good luck Mighty Pawns. Central is proud of you. - Bye, Mr. Wright. - [Miles] Like I said, it's real easy. - No chance of getting caught? - Guaranteed. It's sweet. I just need somebody. Like my old buddy, Frank. Well man, what do you say? - [News Reporter] And now a local report. Today the chess champs from Central Junior High set off to compete in the national tournament taking place over the next two days in Los Angeles. Everyone back home is wishing them well. Go Mighty Pawns. - 500 bucks a day and I know where they stash it. It could be ours tonight. - I don't know. - You gotta do it, Frank. I mean, it's a way for us to make some real money. - No, Miles. - You got nothing better to do, man. I mean, you're not going to no nationals. They locked you out. - They didn't do it. I did it to myself and I'm not gonna do it again. - You a real chump, man. - I don't think so. Not anymore. (knocking on door) - I love you. - I know you do. - I'm sorry about the nationals. - It's not your fault. I did it and I gotta pay the price. - You're all right. - Why not? Look at my mom. (Mrs. Robinson laughs) (upbeat music) (students laughing) (students chattering) - Well, this is where it's all gonna happen. - It's so big. - Yeah. Tomorrow all of this right here will be filled up with other chess teams. - Oh boy. I wanna go home. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We have as much chance to win as anybody here. - Without Frank? - Yeah. Now you guys can still win, not as a team because there are only three of you but you can win individually. - Mr. Green, I'm scared. - Well of course you're scared. These are the nationals. The best teams in the country are gonna be here. But you guys are one of the best teams too. I mean, you're here, aren't you? - Yeah, we're here. - Yeah well, you're here because you deserve to be here. And it's all right to be scared. I'm scared. But I'm also proud. And you guys should be proud too. - Ah, come on, come on now. Don't make me sorry I'm your chess master, all right? - And don't make me sorry I taught you how to play chess. All right? - [Students] All right. - [Steve And Oscar] All right? - [Students] All right. (soft music) - Mr. Wright. - [Ned] Oh, Mrs. Robinson. - Hi. Mr. Wright, I gotta talk to you. - [Ned] Yes? - I need your help. - To do what? - To get Frank to the nationals. - [Ned] But I thought that you said-- - I know I said he couldn't go-- - And you had every right to make that decision. - He has learned his lesson and he oughta be with the team. They need him and he needs them. - Yeah, but it's too late. - When people make up their minds to do something, it's never too late. (all chattering) - [Announcer] Let's welcome all the teams that traveled from all over the United States to come to Los Angeles for this year's National Junior Chess Championships. - So that's the team, huh? - Yeah, that's the New York team. There is Cohen. That's his coach over there, Bucarid, and his assistant Rudolphski. - [Chess Player] Checkmate. - [Chess Player] Checkmate. - [Announcer] Will the representative from Northern Heights please report to the floor. - [Chess Player] Checkmate. - [Announcer] At the conclusion of round two there will be a 30 minute recess before the start of the third round. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! - What's going on? - My mom changed her mind. - Good! - Yeah, but I'm grounded for two months but I can play the nationals. - I hope so. Let's find out. Excuse me. We've got a problem. One of our players just showed up late. - What's his name? - Frank Robinson. - Okay. He's forfeited the first match. - What does that mean? - It means he can play in the rest of the tournament. But not much chance for a first place individual prize but the team's got a chance. (upbeat music) - Checkmate. - Checkmate. - Checkmate. - [Steve] Okay. Okay. So far so good. We gotta keep concentrating. We're doing great. We're doing great. Right now we're tied for second place. We've got four rounds tomorrow. We gotta hold it together. - Green, I am together but I'm losing it fast. - Me too. I'm so scared and excited I'm forgetting everything I know. - Well wait a minute. Everybody in this tournament feels the same way you do. - Yeah, but not as bad as me. - You gotta overcome it. I mean, you cannot be distracted. Oscar will tell you. It's inside you gotta be strong because that's where you get your wins. - Yeah, and that's what we need, people. Wins. - Hear that. We play all the way through to the checkmate. We do not accept draws. We play for the wins. - We know that. It's just hard. - It wouldn't be worth it if it wasn't hard. Let me ask you a question. Who are we anyway? - [Students] Mighty Pawns. - [Oscar] I can't hear you. Who are we? - [Students] Mighty Pawns! - [Oscar] All right! (students laugh) (upbeat music) - Checkmate. - Checkmate. - Checkmate. - Checkmate. - Checkmate. - I've gotta play Jason Cohen, huh? - [Steve] Yeah, you do. - Isn't he one of the best players in the country? - Yeah, he is. But don't you think it's about time he met his match? Huh? Frank, you're good. - But am I good enough? - Yes. Yes, you are. 48 hours ago you didn't even think you were gonna be here and now here you are. You're playing for the championship against the best. You can do it. That's all I'm gonna say. You can do it. - I'm certainly gonna try. - That's all I wanted to hear. That's all I wanted to hear. (audience applauding) - [Lydell] What if he draws? - [Lucy] Third place. - But if he wins? - Then we win. But if he loses, sixth place. - [Jason] What's your rating? - 1720. What's yours? - 2150. (tense music) - It's close. It's close. - Well, nice game, Robinson. Looks like we've got a draw. Congratulations. - I'm sorry. I can't accept the draw. - Check. Check. Check. Check. Checkmate. (audience cheering) (upbeat music) (audience applauding) - Great game. Best I've played against. - Same here. - Well, congratulations. You did it. - [Steve] Thank you. - Congratulations. I'm so proud. - You know, we're gonna miss you next year. - Well I know someone that'll take over D class for you. He loves chess. - His name wouldn't happen to be Green? - Yeah, it is. - Mom, now that I'm a chess champion, am I still grounded? - Do the crime, you do the time. Yes, you are still grounded. But now you have time to teach me to play chess. (both laugh) - [Frank] I love you. - I love you too. (audience applauding) (upbeat music continues)
