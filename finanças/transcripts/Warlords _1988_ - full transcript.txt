David Carradine in WARLORDS oh my god we finally did it i often asked myself how such a wonderful theory as nuclear deterrance was expected to work when the lucky men holding the triggers really couldnt give a damn i mean , why would it bother us when comfortable safe bomb shelters were free with the push of a button a four year all expenses paid underground vacation jacuzzis, saunas, microwaves, a slide show of the grand canyon it was really quite lovely. history was wiped out in a flash for some this meant a fresh start, but not a welcome one position and wealth no longer had meaning. what happened to the people was the strange part. of course most of them died, they were the lucky ones. .many more headed for the desert. maybe in search of some mythacle healing property or maybe just to dissapear hundreds of thousands more mutated into pitiful creatures with a savage hatred of humans so even the bombs didnt end the fighting. an uprising of the mutants had begun a long and bloody crusade to exterminate all of mankind. it was just the kind of war where a few extraordinary people could make all the difference in the world thats him damnit danny, light up those guys god damn son of a bitch ,get em off our tail! frank, if you keep this damn car straight for one second i might be able to get a fix on these guys. hurry, hurry you idiot, catch up to him. if you lose this one the warlords going to have our ass for sure! .cmon! whos the scurge that taught you how to drive anyway? get off my back girl! . swiping this car was your brilliant idea. who cracked up the last car? forget it frank, ok? listen, hug it to the left. now kiss it to the right.

ohh, i cant ride that thing .well whats it for? .for show .you know, recumbanent dna was a big controversey in my day. fact is, otherwise perfectly sane people had opinions far left field about messing with genes. unpure, tainted, offensive, they said ohh, dont misunderstand me, i'm all for it. all for it. they said the fabric, fiber, of the world would unraveled. that we'd all fall into the quagmire of purgatory, nasty, foul, coarse! no way, what could be more simple than rearranging the building blocks of life? yes sir. gods little tinker toys, imagine that!. why some people even said .it was unholy, satan worship! they said it again and again it was like playing god! rotten! filthy! you know some people would want us to burn in hell. they say that 2780 on your neck is like having 666 on your scalp putrid! festering! squalid! you're really crazy you know that? maybe so, keeps the mutants away. . . .jesus . . so where to now trooper?. well ammo says we're real close to the camp. oh hey, thats suicide. yeah, it isnt your fight well, wait a minute now, no sweat i just want you to come out of there alive i mean after all we've been through we havent been through anything yet yeah we aint gonna unless you come out of there in one piece theres someone else i'm supposed to pick up there, a scientist. billings, some kind of genetics expert. what do you need him for?. the government wants him back, they want to open up the plant again. they have a big plan to repopulate the earth. great, clone world can you imagine a whole town of guys just like the colonel? yeah that would be pretty scary is your uhh is your wife a clone? does it matter? well yeah, i mean ok listen. say we cant find her right? now we just get a few of those guys and and have them crank out another one, like sausages! will you just shut up?
