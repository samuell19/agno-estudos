Okay, everyone get ready. Are you ready? Yes. Okay. Also, lighting was late. A little bit late. Music, please. Action! Keep it going. Watch the timing. Miss Qiu-lan! Sorry. You have the wrong person. I'm not Qiu-lan. You are Miss Qiu-lan. We met in the factory many... Too early. Folks, let's do it again. Come on! Music. Miss Qiu-lan! Sorry. You have the wrong person. I'm not Qiu-lan. You are Miss Qiu-lan. We met in the factory many times. The factory? Are you from the factory? -I'm not. Sorry, wrong person. On the day of the strike, I saw you at the demonstration. That wasn't me. You came alone? Yes. Let's go talk in my car. I did come alone today, but if anything happens to me, the strike will continue. -Do you want to talk or not? If so, come with me now. If not, I'll leave. Let's go. Miss Qiu-lan! Is everything alright? -Who is he? I don't know him. Miss Qiu-lan! Shall we dance? Sorry. Are you alone? I'm alone, too. Come on, spin me around. You seem to be in a bad mood. Sorry. Move! Move! Watch out! -What the hell! -Move out of the way! Miss Yu! Miss Yu, why did you come back to Shanghai? Miss Yu! Say a few words, please! Big news! Big news! Thank you, Miss! Today's news! Film star Jean Yu arrives in Shanghai today! Welcome to the Cathay Hotel. Please be careful. Miss Yu, welcome to the Cathay Hotel. It's an honor to have you here. This way, please. You must be Mr. Speyer. It's a pleasure to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. Forgive me for saying so, Miss Yu, but you are even more beautiful in person than you are on the playbills. Thank you, Mr. Speyer, but you flatter me. I'm only speaking the truth. Miss Yu, would you please sign here? Can I assume my room is ready? Yes, of course. Your suite has been arranged exactly as you always have it. Thank you. -Thanks. -This way. How was your journey? I hope you're not too exhausted. -Everything was fine. -Glad to hear that. It's quite a long trip from Hong Kong, isn't it? Yes. Well, whatever it is, just let me know. I'm always here at your service. -Thank you. Monsieur Hubert will be here to see you very soon. He left something in your room for you. That's alright. Thanks. Thank you, Miss Yu. Mr. Speyer, Miss Yu is on a call. Hello, may I have your name, please? I would like to speak to Director Tan Na. -Who's she talking to? -Theater. Director Tan Na is not available right now. Please tell him I've arrived in Shanghai. This is my telephone number 4278... -That's it? -That's all. Let me know when she makes or receives calls. News! News! News! Hey! Give me one. Hello, Director! Director, these are the costumes for Acts 1 and 2. -Altered? -Altered. Good. Director, Miss Jean Yu just called. She's arrived in Shanghai. Told you she would come. I knew it when the Japanese caught her ex-husband. Only you think she's here for the show. She came back to save him. Jean came back to act with me. She's been away from the stage so long. This woman... Too mysterious. She's like a box of secrets. Who really knows her? Remember when you two were fooling around, she was still with her husband... Ex. Ex-husband. Let me tell you, you're so addicted to it. Those journalists got photos of you! Who helped you? Me! Director! The stage model is ready for you. Pretty good. You should rewrite the bar scenes. Don't put your lives on stage. You know how long I've been waiting for her. Hey! You. Don't go looking for trouble. Watch out for yourself! I've told you already. Don't come to me when you mess up. Thank you, Miss Yu. Excuse me, may I have your autograph? Thank you! I've always liked you. I've seen all your plays, films and interviews. I wish I could be a woman like you. I know a lot about you. I know you were married, but not to the man you loved. You have a nostalgic soul, and you came back to help him out. I studied in Tokyo before, majored in Japanese literature and drama. Now I'm working for a magazine. I know many Japanese people. Maybe there's something I can do to help. I know where your ex-husband is locked up. One of my connections can take you there. What else do you know? I also know that... you are not Jean Yu. You are... Miss Qiu-lan. I was in the audition and I read the script. I know all the lines by heart, word by word. Really? Show me. I saw you at the demonstration on the day of the strike. Are you a worker from the factory? I'm not. I've always wanted to talk to you. Qiu-lan, listen to me... As a friend or as our factory inspector? Inspector? Both. Then please bear with us for a while. We're getting prepared for the next strike. Regarding the strike... I don't want to discuss such a serious topic with you today. I just want you to be happy. Friend or not, that's the end of our discussion. Miss Yu, would you please let me go watch your rehearsal at the Lyceum Theatre? I've been dreaming about seeing it. Thank you for walking with me. Miss Yu. Miss Yu, please... Please let me watch your rehearsal! I would do anything for you! Miss Yu! Please, take me to your rehearsal! Miss Yu! Please, take me to your rehearsal! I'm sorry, but this is our backstage. She's with me, let her in. Let's go. Hello, Miss Yu! Hello, Miss Yu! Get ready for the rehearsal. Folks, hurry up! Get changed! Come on. Let's start. -Sit down there. -Okay. How is it going? Miss Jean Yu. Thanks. Folks, let's start from Act 1! Ok. Ready? Lights. Music, please. Action! When you left, I thought you disappeared forever. I didn't think you'd come back. What have you been doing all this time? I've been to many places and I've done many things. Some of them I loved, some I didn't. But I did them anyway. Then I came back. Then you came back. I'm back for what I love. To be with you. Did I disturb your life back in those days? Did I? -Why would you say that? -Just asking. I was the one who disturbed you. I disturbed you first, remember? Do you remember? The first time we met. At the factory, I heard some music, and I followed the music to a bar and I saw you. I looked at you for quite a while and then I walked towards you, right in front of you and talked to you. Sorry I left without saying a word. I hope I didn't hurt you. Welcome back, Miss Qiu-lan. Such a great actress! Takes guts to act next to a star like Jean Yu! I wasn't acting. It's out of pure admiration for Director Tan and Jean Yu. I want to be an actress. It has nothing to do with my job. Forget about it. You're paid by the anti-Japan agency, now you want to act in a play by a left-wing troupe? Tan Na is one of a kind to believe you. Enough. When are you planning to get rid of her ex? That's why you approached Jean Yu, isn't it? Does it have anything to do with you? Sure it does. All the Japanese know it. They doubt that Jean Yu has other motives. Shall we make a deal? From now on, I give you messages from the Japanese, while you give me messages from the Chinese. In this case we can get double salaries. The Japanese have agreed to set her ex free. Your time has come. We'll let Jean Yu visit him in a couple of days. How does that sound? Work with me! I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Drive! -Welcome to our hotel. -Thank you. I'll be waiting outside. Okay. Have someone check if it has been cleaned. Shanghai 3217. Morning, Sir! Morning, Mathieu! Mr. Li just called. -Mr. Li from Commerce Press. -What did he say? He said he'd give you an answer soon. Thank you! Is there is anything I can help you with? No, thank you. Chief, Captain Furuya is here. Salute! Everyone, this is Captain Furuya from the Communication HQ of the Navy General Staff. He just rushed in from Tokyo, so let's waste no time. Please be seated. Ready to start. I'm Furuya Saburo, pleasure to meet you all. As you may be aware, starting from midnight December 1, all the radios of the Imperial Navy, Army and Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be updated with a new code system. The encryption measures will also be upgraded soon. My visit this time is to share with you the new Navy Code Book D. Code Book C and Typewriter 79 here in your office will continue to be in use after the update. Most of the ciphers have been replaced, please be careful. For example, NORTH means Soviet Union, SOUTH means US, SOUTHEAST means Nanking government, KOYANAGI means UK, SPRING means Singapore, KAGA means Guam, SUNNY means tension eased, RAIN means crisis, KAMAKURA... KAMAKURA means action, YAMAZAKURA means... Still no news? Furuya-san, you probably know this already, we're living in dangerous times. You have to prepare for the worst. -Here's the mescaline you asked for. -Thank you. Please say hello to Monsieur Hubert for me. Thank you. Welcome to the Cathay Hotel. Hello, please come this way. Mr. Speyer is waiting for you. Thank you. Hello M. Hubert! Send the telegram. Messenger A49 has entered the fortress. Encrypt 375. Request to begin the Two-way Mirror Project. Two-way Mirror. Wait for the reply. Monsieur H, maybe I shouldn't ask such a question, but who is the woman next to Furuya, in the photograph you gave to Jean Yu? Miyoko. Furuya's wife. She is dead. We killed her. It was an accident. She was beautiful. Is that why you asked Jean Yu to come back? Why do you ask? No no no no, I'm not arguing the decision. I just don't think she is made to be a spy. It's true she's not one of us... But, she's completed so many dangerous tasks. Last time, she almost died in Saigon. No matter what we've asked her to do, she remains always an artist, a woman. Saul, my friend. I'm going to tell you a secret, a secret I've been keeping for years. I'm all ears. You know there are lots of old books in my bookshop. Most of them are common titles that are worth very little. John Galsworthy, Romain Rolland, and a few dozen chunky fictions... I don't know who would want to read them nowadays. -Cigaratte? -Thank you. Or if people will even read at all in the future. But among all these, I do have one real treasure. You must promise me to keep this a secret. Of course. Thieves never bother with my shop because there's nothing to steal. But if this news gets out, I'll have to buy a safe! I've never mentioned it to anyone yet. "The Sorrows of Young Werther". Goethe. The 1774 first edition. It was signed by Goethe himself. Nietzsche got a hold of it somehow and wrote a few words after that. It can't be true! I've no idea how the book made its way to Shanghai! I came across it haphazardly amongst a pile of old books. I didn't know you collected original German titles. My dear Saul, if you can ensure Jean Yu's absolute safety during this mission, this treasure will be yours. I'll do everything I can. AGREE TO START TWO-WAY MIRROR PROJECT CORRESPONDENCE IS TIMED ON 24:00 SATURDAY. ANNOUNCE DIRECTION FOR YAMAZAKURA CODENAME. Frederic! Frederic! It's been so long! -Yeah. I'm happy to see you! It's such a joy to see you! It's been three years. God, three years. You're looking so well! I wonder and doubt if I have made the best decision to bring you back. Have you heard about your ex-husband? Yes. He may not have many days left. He was a part of your life. You should see him. Have you seen him? No. Fine, let's change the subject. We talk about Saul Speyer. Speyer? Saul is one of my people. He took refuge in the Chinese Embassy in Vienna three years ago. He fled Austria for Shanghai. His family is still locked up in the Nazi concentration camps and he doesn't even know if they are still alive. You do not need to hide anything from him, except for what I'm about to tell you now. He will help you with the process, but the final mission stays unknown to him. Frederic, tell me what I will do. Have you seen the photo? Yes. Her name is Miyoko. You look like her. I just read in the news yesterday that you're back. Why? I came back for a play and I wanted to see you. Did they torture you? How did you end up here? No one protects you on a sinking ship. There's a lot of money to be made during war. I helped them. The Nanking government didn't offer you any protection? Protection? They just want to get rid of me. They used me for what I was worth and when I was useless, they turned around and locked me up for embezzlement. You're not sent by the Nanking government, are you? Please! The Chungking government? I can't stay here. Jean, you have all the good connections... Help me. I've been back to our home on Avenue Joffre. Let's go there. It's very safe. The Japanese sent you here, didn't they? What are you thinking? Everyone knows our home was on Avenue Joffre. That's the most unsafe place! Get out! You're exactly the same as before... Haven't changed a bit. Miss Yu. Morning! -What brings you here? -I'm here to pick you up. -Pick me up? -That's right. -To the Lyceum. -No. To Shipyard Bar. Hot water and hot wine for two. Okay. That day, if you hadn't appeared, we may never have met each other. But we could have met inside the factory. I used to go to the union hall often. Were you there to monitor us? No. I went there to see you. Your wine, sir. Thank you! I think you were there to monitor us and to see whether we were discussing... I think you were monitoring us. No. I really admire you and your colleagues. From the moment I order the wine... -So, from the wine. I've already taken off my coat. It still seems a bit slow. Make it slightly quicker. That's the end of our discussion for today. Now that I have spoken my mind, you might be angry at me, or you probably think that I won't want to see you again. No, I don't. No matter what happens, no matter what changes take place, no matter what you see or hear, I'll always be here waiting for you. Believe me. I do. This woman might be connected to the Japanese. Or not. She might be a spy for Chungking. Well, as we're still not certain of her identity or what she's really after, it's maybe best that you spend your efforts on Saburo Furuya. This is Kajiwara. Expert shooter. Dangerous man. Monsieur Hubert has instructed you to use the utmost caution with him. Do not expose yourself. Excuse me, is there a letter from the Lyceum for me? -Yes, please wait a moment. -Thank you. -Here you are. -Thank you. -Excuse me! -Yes, sir? Excuse me, but do you know who that lady is? Her name is Jean Yu. She's a very famous actress. She's here in Shanghai for a new play. This weekend there will be the first show. TARGET'LL APPEAR AT OPENING SHOW OF SATURDAY FICTION WILL ARRANGE A49 TO MEET HIM. PROCEED AS PLANNED. You've come. I told you I would come see you. I didn't think it would be so soon. Since last time we met, I've been thinking about you. Me, too. What has happened? You seem to be a completely different person. That guy showed up again. He's been tailing me. He knows we're here. Someone leaked it. Listen, I have to find out who the leak is. The one who told the factory owners about our strike. -Who do you suspect? -Everyone. Am I a suspect? It's very dangerous here. You have to leave now. -We go together! -Leave now! I'll find you! Turn off the lights! Good. Cut! Lights, lights up, please! Thank you. Okay, let's do it again. Okay. Are you ready? Ready? Miss Yu, this play will be a smash hit. The city of Shanghai is waiting. Mr. Mo Zhiyin, our producer. I'd love to invite Miss Yu to dinner tonight as a kind gesture of hospitality. Please be my guests. Shall we dine at my hotel? -Okay, no problem. Get in the car, please. -Here! -To a successful opening night! -Thanks! -Thank you, Miss Yu! Thank you, Miss Yu! As the producer, I have to drink with you one by one. -Take it slow. -This guy, Chen, an honest guy, right? He said, he said, his music, if there are Japanese, he won't play. I'll never play for the Japanese. What the hell? You're an artist. Art is universal. You have to play for everyone. They didn't destroy your house. Why the fuss? Will you fuss when they come and kill someone? Did they kill anyone in your house? No. What are you doing? -Don't get yourself drunk. -You're drunk. -I am not. Let's have another one. Next time, I'll bring some Japanese friends to watch your... No... Who is that? Hey! What are you up to? Come over! -Sorry. -What do you want? I'm Mo Zhiyin. Who cares? Wait, wait! Good evening! Mo Zhiyin, Mo Zhiyin! Mo - Zhi - Yin. Miss Jean Yu? Yes, you must be Miss Jean Yu? Yes, yes, it's Miss Jean Yu. What an honour! He might be a fan of your films. I like your films. Hey, Yanagi! -Yes. -Take a photo for us. -Yes. -A photo, you and me... -Yes, please. -Okay? You speak good Japanese. -A photo. -Sorry, Miss Yu is tired. Miss Jean Yu, let's take a photo together. Tan Na, sit down. You're not an actor, are you? I'm really sorry. I'm talking to Miss Jean Yu now. -You're done. -Yanagi, take the photo now. Sit down, Tan Na. It's just a photo. -Calm down, please. -Sit down! Get out of my way! How dare you? How dare you? -Tan Na! -That's quick! Accompany her back to her room. Tan Na! What's wrong with you? Move! Sit down, sit down. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen please! What? This is not Tokyo or Peking. We're in Shanghai. I'm not having any of this at my hotel, I would ask you to please leave. Or I'll be forced to call the police. Please take these gentlemen outside. We haven't taken the photo yet. Wait... Hey, Miss Jean Yu! Photo! Photo! Miss Jean Yu, I like your films. -The Japs are drunk. -Let's get another... -Shut up! -Wow! What all the fuss about? He is just drunk. Let's keep going... Hey, what the hell? Tan Na! Get him his coat. Let me put on my coat. I can't put it on. I'm fine. I'm fine. Used to it. Miss Yu! What's up? I know you will pick up your ex-husband tomorrow. Miss Yu, you have a nostalgic soul, but you have to know that there are a lot of Chinese who want to kill him, you might not be able to protect him when he comes out. When did you come to Shanghai? About three years ago. I was supposed to go back to Peking, but it was in chaos, so I stayed in Shanghai. Do you know where I first got into theater? Yenching University. I studied literature at Yenching University. And that was the time when I often went to watch your plays and your films. At that time Bai Mei was my name. Bai Mei? -Yes. -A beautiful name. Bai Mei. My father gave me the name. It means my mother's favorite flower, the rose. My mother passed away when I was very young, when I was still a naive girl. Later, after I grew up, I learned that the world was not what I thought it would be. Miss Yu, I know you were raised in an orphanage. You have a foster father. Right. He is a very good father. He taught me a lot. I miss him. We don't see each other often. Not often at all. I also miss my father. He left me behind in this world. Now I just have myself. I'm all alone. Sorry, Miss Yu, I've got to go. Bai Mei, it's too late. The concession is probably closed. Stay over. I have always liked you. Always. Your name is Bai Mei. Bai Mei. Your father gave you the name. Yes. My father gave me the name. Now, what do you see? I see the Lyceum Theater, the neon lights at the gate, many people... many people... Posters of you... I see... I'm Kajiwara. I just got an order from headquarters. We'll return to Tokyo this evening. I'll pick you up at 17:30. Yes. TARGET CHANGED ITINERARY TWO-WAY MIRROR PROJECT ADVANCED MESSENGER AND EX MUST ARRIVE AT CATHAY HOTEL BEFORE 5:30PM Can I have a word with you? This is the last time. What do you mean, the last time? I mean what I'm saying. Frederic, this will be the last role I will play. Here they come! Miss Jean Yu! Miss Jean Yu! Miss Yu! Miss Yu, where are you going now? Miss Yu, did you come back to Shanghai to save your ex? Where are we going now? To my hotel, you can rest there. There's a ship heading for Hong Kong tonight. I will see you off before my performance. Miss Yu! Are you alright? Take him through to the clinic. Secure the doors. Don't let anyone in who isn't a guest of the house. Yes. Everything went according to plan. We got Furuya, he's in the clinic. Should we start? Just a moment, we must wait for the drug to take effect. To Cathay Hotel! -Director Tan! -How is Miss Yu? Miss Yu is fine. Her ex-husband died. I'm going to the hotel now. -But the hotel has been... Get everyone prepared, I'm going to the hotel. -How could you... -We'll talk later. Mr. Furuya, listen to my voice. Let me help you. Get away! Stop! This is the French concession. Japanese doesn't have the right to enter this property. Okay, I understand, but you have to find me a solution now. An important Japanese national is missing. We believe he must be in this hotel. We're here to search the premises. I can't let you in. This is a very important case, you know? Leave, now! This is very important! Let us in! Miss Yu! Miss Yu! Miss Yu is here! Miss Yu is here! Miss Yu is here! Out! Get everyone out of here. Director Tan Na, Miss Yu might not be able to come tonight. Miyoko... Yes. It's Miyoko. I missed you. Miyoko is here. Miyoko is here. Kamakura... Kamakura. Right now. We are in Kamakura. In Kamakura... Do you still remember Kamakura? We saw Yamazakura there... Yamazakura is your favorite... Miyoko... Finally you are here... I left you alone... I'm sorry... Miyoko... Have you been wanting to see me, too? You can have a good rest now. I'm here with you. Attention! Move! Hey, don't move! don't move! Move, you asshole! -Here! -Open the door! -Let's go! -Yes. Next to the spring, we saw Yamazakura. Spring means... Spring... Spring... Kamakura... Kamakura... Like rain... When sakura petals fall... Yamazakura petals... Yamazakura means? Yamazakura means... Yamazakura... What's happening? Why isn't it working? You can't hear anything? Nothing. Inform the Japanese Consulate, when he is awake. Fifteen minutes before the curtain opens. Be quick! What else did she tell you? She asked you not to worry. She'll be fine. She said if you can't reach her, or if the two of you lose contact, she'll be waiting for you at the Shipyard Bar tomorrow. She didn't come back for my play, did she? Why don't you trust Jean Yu? -How can I? -You should trust her. I'm nothing but a chess piece to her. But now I must trust her. You've done an excellent job, my child. Do you have everything you need now? Almost. Tell me, Yamazakura, where does it point to? You didn't get it? LYCEUM THEATER Is Director Tan Na with Miss Jean Yu now? That day, if you hadn't appeared, we may never have met each other. Yes. But we could have met inside the factory. I used to go to the union hall often. Were you there to monitor us? No. I went there to see you. I don't think so. You were there to monitor us and to see whether we were discussing... Okay. Quickly dispatch a message! Yes, Sir. Send as Most Urgent. Class A Top Secret! Connect with them now! I found the channel. Katana points to Singapore! Confirming just one line, sir?

It's personal. -Of course. You should leave immediately. There's a car waiting for you outside. It will take you straight to the port. I'm going to the Lyceum Theater. Are you crazy? You must board the boat tonight. There's no need to be worried. You'll be protected. The Captain is one of our men. I have to go back, Saul. I'm not boarding the ship without Tan Na. You should tell Monsieur Hubert. I will. Your driver will take you straight to the theater. You should be there in no time. Wait. They found the clinic. -Damn it! -What's happened? They know. The Japanese are on the way to the clinic. They will find Furuya there. We have to hurry, this way. The car is waiting at the back door. You will accompany her there. -Yes, of course. -Miss Yu, I have to go see what's going on at the clinic. Goodbye. Saul! Take care! To the Lyceum! Gentlemen, please. This is the financial and communication center. We're only here to receive and transmit information between business... This is Miss Bai Yunshang. Tonight, she'll play the part for Miss Jean Yu. Miss Yu couldn't make it because of an unexpected urgency. She asked me send everyone her apologies. Are we ready? Ready. Music, please. Open the curtains! Go check that room. Found him. He's in here! Furuya-san! Furuya-san! Furuya-san! What has happened? I have no idea. I was carried here and it seemed I was talking to Miyoko. Your wife? No. No. It's that woman. It's Jean Yu. -Jean Yu? -Jean Yu was here. We have to catch her immediately! Furuya-san! A49 LEFT SAFELY. FORTRESS DESTROYED. RETREAT NOW! Next to the spring? Next to the spring, we saw Yamazakura. Spring means... Spring means... Spring... Kamakura... Rain... Sakura petals fall like... Yamazakura petals fall like... Yamazakura... What the hell is this? -Wait in the car. -Okay. Miss Yu! No matter what you see or hear, I'll always be here waiting for you. Trust me. I do. Miss Yu is here? -Miss Yu! -Why are you here? Follow me! Miss Yu... Get out of here now. It's too dangerous. I've told Tan Na to meet you at the Shipyard Bar tomorrow. Okay. Just go. -Where's Miss Yu? -She's over there. We'll go on. Get them ready! Places! Miss Bai! You made it onto the stage. What a pity you won't be able to finish it. Come on. Miss Bai, let's make a deal. Don't you try to run away this time. I know what you did with Jean Yu. What's that look? You don't believe it? You will when you hear it from the Japanese. Don't overestimate yourself. Both of you are players, bitches. If you play nicely, maybe I will turn Jean Yu in to the Japanese, and keep you with me. Please wait for me at the back gate. Go! Why are you here? What has happened? You seem to be a completely different person. This is the role you wanted to play, right? You like that? What happened? It's very dangerous here. Let's go! You and me together! You go first. You're going nowhere. Jean Yu. You won't get away, bitch! This way. Please wait here. Let's go. Don't shoot! What happened? Are you alright? Did you kill my wife? Did you kill her? It's here. Hey. Are you sure Jean Yu will come? I'm sure. But please have mercy on Tan Na. Please! Bastard! You lied to me from the beginning! You betrayed me! You asked me to get her back on the show deliberately! Don't move! I've told you so many times. Stay away from that woman. Now you know what I meant. Now you know. Nothing bad will happen to Jean Yu. The Japanese want her alive. Just go upstairs. You don't have to do anything else. Just sit still. Don't forget what I just told you. All you need to do is to sit still. Nothing else. Be good. Do nothing. You and I will survive. I've talked to the Japanese and they promised me. Dear Fred, My Father, I believe you will receive this letter as scheduled. Now, I'm going to tell you the truth. Yamazakura means Hawaii. Please forgive me. I think I did what I should have done. Take good care of yourself, Fred. I've never said it before but I've always wanted to tell you: Thank you. Thank you for giving me a father. Your Loving Jean "The Sorrows of Young Werther" Ultimately, it is the desire, not the desired, that we love. Friedrich Nietzsche Don't you miss home? I feel lonely from time to time. May I borrow your light? Do you have a light? Thank you. Why are these foreigners still around? Who knows? Anyway, they'll end up in the concentration camps. Get out of the car. Where are they? Move...
