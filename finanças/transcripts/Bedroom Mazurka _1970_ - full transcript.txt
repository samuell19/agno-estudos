- BEDROOM MAZURKA - - Krabbes?g?rd Scholars School - You're going too far! You can't have my panties, they were the most expensive in the store! - Getting cold feet? - There are ants everywhere. How romantic! No! No! From the beginning! No, this is important. It must sound beautiful. We'll take it from, "That the heart can rejuvenate." - So, Herr Peter... - Who's smoking? - Who's smoking? - Good afternoon, Madam Bosted, ... - ... it's me! - I didn't know ... - ... that Professor Mikkelsen smoked. - I don't. - But we were just taking a little break. - My husband wants to see you. Yes, I'll go to the Headmaster as soon as we're done here. He wants to talk to you right away. Just as soon as the lesson is finished. What does the Headmaster want with him? - They usually make announcements on Tuesday. - Something must have happened. Isn't it blasphemy to smoke in the church? - You shouldn't smoke here in the church. - Thanks for your help. It smells like that Prince brand. - Who won? - What? - Ole and Michael... who won? - He did. The winnings go into the collection. Put them in the plate. Don't take advantage just because people say I have a liberal nature. So, if you become Headmaster, you'll allow girls to enter the school? Yes. And if you were a respectable man, you wouldn't show nude photos to Torben. - Give me the photos, Torben. - Here... Thanks. Now we can take a break. Hurry over to the Headmaster's window, and keep us informed. We're on Channel 8. - What's for lunch today? - Swedish sausage and rhubarb. Canned meat and monkey snot! Bertha calling Olga: Mikkelmax is en route to the Headmaster's office. Mikkelmax is enroute. Olga to Listening Post. Get into position. Mikkelmax has arrived at the Rectory. Minister of Culture? That's not bad. Congratulations! "Per aspera ad astra", as Horace once said. But it stays between us. It's not official yet. It shouldn't come out until after my audience ... ... with the king. The Headmaster will be the Minister of Culture. God save Denmark. Who will become Headmaster, then? - The Headmaster? Me? - It's not I who made the decision. The school board wanted a young man experienced with our young people, ... ... as well as having a sense of tradition here at Krubbes?g?rds Scholars School. One who is also open to new ideas in these changing times. - Yes, such as student input, free uniforms.... - Take it easy, Professor Mikkelsen. At least until I've departed. It still needs to be negotiated. Salary, public announcements, ... ... and it's quite possible you'll say no. - Unless you feel sufficiently qualified. - Yes, yes... I feel qualified. There are some other factors ... Oh, there's still more to prove? Yes... you might say that. The president of the school board wanted me to talk to you. - I've been like a father to you, Max. - Yes... - I may call you Max? - Yes, thank you. You're a leader among the faculty here. You've been a student here yourself, ... ... and know the school inside out. But then there's this. - You're not married. - Married? No. - Engaged? - No. No one in sight. We cannot have a bachelor as Headmaster at Krabbes?g?rd. It is absolutely necessary that he be married. It is a political necessity. - Assistant Professor Holst is married. - Yes. He is married. My wife is very fond of Professor Holst, the "Door Mat". And vice versa. Olga calling Bertha, keep an eye on the "Door Mat". If he looks up, let us know. Okay! Olga calling Listening Post. "Door Mat" is today's objective. Ready for action. The target is "Door Mat". I have him in sight. - He's looking up now! - Shoot! Good hit! Stand by. Olga calling Listening Post. Take up position! Was that you, you little bastard? I'll take this! - Olga calling Artillery: Report! - He got the rear gunner. Learn to take better cover! Olga calling cannon one! Olga calling cannon one! - Cannon one here! - Fire at the ass-wagger! Shoot! It would be nice to hear some news from Michael. - Did your wife make the decision? - No, but I have to admit ... - Max, do you have something against women? - Women? What women? That isn't why you're not ... - What? - It isn't because you've never ... - Oh, you mean... ? - Yes. - Never! - Why not? It's never been an issue. There were always more important things. That's something I confiscated. I just fished it out. - Fished it out? - Yes, at the church. At the church? Yes! I have to go. The class is waiting. Botany. Botany? In the church? - Why do you never take gymnastics? - I can't take physical exercise! I only have enough energy for Mazurka lessons. You know the Mazurka? - Why do we have to learn to dance like that? - It's a tradition at the school. "The Mazurka is a courtly dance." And... one, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, three! Stop! For more than 100 years there has been a Mazurkan tradition here. It's a courtly dance, and a tribute to women! Now, watch me... I won't disturb you, Professor Holst. I see the young people are making progress. Thanks entirely to you. If I can be of any help, Professor Holst ... It would please both me and the boys! Mazurka! All of you, watch closely. - He wants to have her. - No, he just wants to be Headmaster. - Your husband is happy about the transfer? - Yes. We just need to find the right successor. - Have you seen how she opens the door? - What door? She sneaks to the shower room door, knocks... then opens it quickly. She'd like to see something she doesn't get to see everyday. Max Mikkelsen has been with him today. Mikkelsen? Yes, but he's not my favorite, Professor Holst. - Do you think they're doing it? - She's probably not very erotic. And the Headmaster? It's probably been a while since he's squeezed anything. - Squeezed? What do you mean? - He just reads to the little redhead! - BATH - - Why aren't you in class? - I'm going to the dentist. Remember to say, "Wait a moment", next time you're not dressed. When I'm in the shower? - Oh hell, the bell is calling! - Yes... - The bell... I'll have to run! - But you can't take physical exercise! Marriage is for a lifetime. Yes, but you don't need to be married before the Jubilee. You can just tell the school board that you have some plans. - But I don't. - Just say you do. - It wouldn't be true. - Dear Max, words are just words. Take my word for it. In a political life, ... ... a pleasant lie is often better than an unpleasant truth. - Eric, what are you doing out here? - Hi, father, how are you? - Why aren't you in class? - I was excused from physical education. - What's the matter? - It's something with my leg. - And so... ? - So I was doing a bit of nature study. - Hi, Sis! - I'm going to the school board meeting. - I have to hurry. - Jump in! - Where are you going? - I'm going home. - Aren't you going to school? - There's no school today. I'll walk... I need the fresh air. Hi... - Ovid: Ars Amatoria - The Art of Love As Class President, we have only one order of business, ... ... namely, the appointment of a new Headmaster. Mr. Mutzer's secret report suggests that the Headmaster's favorite to replace him ... ... is Professor Max Mikkelsen, also known as Mikkelmax. I've been a professor here for nearly four years, ... - ... and I've written two textbooks. - In botany and the history of philosophy. Most schools in the country use them. They're excellent books. One thing concerns us very much, Professor Mikkelsen ... Yes, my thesis on the architect and philosopher, Pericles. It's almost finished. We on the school board are all old-timers. And we won't abandon the old traditions and spirit that made this school great! - I can vouch for Mikkelson's spirit. - Then we can reach a quick decision. Remember what our founder, Otto Evart Krabbes?, said in the by-laws. "In order to lead the teaching staff of this school, the Headmaster must be married." - Then he'll be getting married at last. - Report, please. Max Mikkelsen is innocent in regards to women. - Is he still a virgin? - Mr. Burneweller, do you have something to say? - Hell, yes! - Please watch your language. - I meant, at his age ... - He's still too young! - He may not like women! - We need to get some little boys... You can joke all you want. But the alternative is the "Door Mat". The slave driver! - ... no unmarried headmaster at the school. - Yes, he must be married ... Thanks, put it here... Professor Mikkelsen has informed me of his decision to marry. - So there is someone? - Uh... yes. - Is it a woman we know? - Discretion forbids, sir. Naturally... Getting any yet? The Jubilee is a month from now. We'll introduce the new Headmaster's fianc?e at that time. If you're married or engaged by then, you can count on my support! Do we want to help Mikkelmax enter into the bonds of holy matrimony, or at least become engaged? - Should we show him how to do it? - Those in favor vote yes. If enough ... We'll now take a vote. The proposal has passed unanimously. Cheers, Mikkelsen. Thank you for coming here. To good shooting... Now, drink up and enjoy! Your turn, Mikkelsen. Go ahead. - Just pull that? - Yes, pull that! - Bullseye! Bravo, Mikkelsen! - It was probably just luck. No, it was skill. - How's the shooting? - My daughter, Lina. - Max Mikkelsen, professor. - Soon to be Headmaster... perhaps. Oh, the young genius who will keep the proud traditions alive! - Don't embarrass the boy, Lina. - Did I say something wrong? Yes, it's a fine old school. But I don't know about the genius part. - I have to go. We're having a sit-in. - What's a sit-in? - We staging a protest. - About what? - What else? - Down with U.S. imperialism! Up with Ho Chi Minh! Up with Che Guevura! When the revolution comes they'll hang all us old relics from the lampposts! Nobody cares about what we think! And there you are, trying to cram students into a school ... ... that's just a capitalist indoctrination facility for boys who can't think for themselves! So, you're a Communist? - Hallelujah and amen! I'm gone... - She drives me crazy, Mikkelsen. Who pays for those layabouts' debauchery? I'll tell you who ... our taxes! Yes! Yes, she is cute! - Papa? - My daughter, Erica de Renan. - Professor Mikkelsen. - You have a telephone call, Papa. Will you take care of Professor Mikkelsen? Excuse me... Are you interested in erotic art? Would you like to see my beautiful etchings? Aren't they charming? I bought them cheaply on the left bank. Yes, typical French work. Is that, perhaps, a Jacobsen? - No, it's a Larsen. - You have a really nice place here. It's a bit cluttered ... ... but I am all alone. Do you mind if I change into something a bit more comfortable? - That's fine, I'll just turn my back. - You're so cute. I was once married, in France. - Did you know that? - No. - Men are terribly unfaithful, don't you agree? - Yes, if you say so. Too bad they're so treacherous. There are so many things a man and a woman can do. My God! You must have something to drink! No thanks, I've just had ... Cognac! Men love a good cognac. What kind of a hostess am I? - Does it bother you to see me like this? - No, quite the opposite. You are so ... So beautiful? No compliments, darling. I'm immune to that sort of thing. - To your health. - And to yours. You speak French! You've probably had great success with women? No, I'm not very good with them. - What is it? - A muscle cramp! Can you give me a massage? No... further down. Yes... there! - You're going to be Headmaster? - It's not for sure. I'll put in a good word for you with my father. Trust me. Thank you. That's very kind. Let me show you something. Sit down. Don't look, it's a surprise. - Do you have a cold, cheri? - No. Just a frog in my throat. What do you think? Damn! Headmaster Bosted. Good afternoon, Madam Renan, what can I do for you? Rape? Max Mikkelsen? That's hard to believe. You're not mistaken? Forgive me, Mrs. de Renan. It does sound terrible. But Max Mikkelsen? That he would have raped you! Of course, Madam ... That's dreadful, Madam! Yes, it is a criminal offense. I'll find out, Mrs. de Renan. Thank you. That was Burneweller's daughter saying she was raped by Max Mikkelsen? Yes, she was quite upset. - She's lying, of course. - You think so? She would gladly allow herself to be raped several times a day. Women in a certain situation often become strange at some point. - She probably wanted to, but he didn't. - You think so? Have you ever thought that a woman could burn with erotic lust? I think you actually have the right of it! Yes? Yes... Don't forget to call her back. May I help you? - Looking for anything specific? - No. - Any special interests? - No, I'm just looking around. Here we have homosexual books, and all these are about group sex. - It appeals to some. - Yes, sure... - And with animals. - Animals? - And here is the more normal. - I'm not just looking for pictures. I'd really like to learn about pleasing women. - Oh... then let's go upstairs. - Thank you. - What will you do when he's gone? - I'll still have Mr. Nilsson. My monkey. My cute little monkey. - How much is this, young lady? - 82.50. We have more expensive ones over here. After you... Here you are. There's a lot of sadism stuff up here. Yes, thank you... Thanks! This is new. It fastens at the back. - Is it something to do with animals? - Sadism, but if that doesn't interest you, ... - ... perhaps you'd like to try this bridle? - No, thanks. This is for masturbation. You just squeeze the pump! A vibrator is always practical, and this one has two speeds. And you can slip on one of these little things. This one's very exciting. You can even scratch your back. And then there's this one! But perhaps you already have one of these? Excuse me! Good afternoon, Miss Burneweller! - What's he doing here? - It's only Professor Mikkelsen. You remember me? - Of course I do. He raped my sister. - Awesome, dude! Violence should be met with violence! - What did you say? - My sister said that you raped her. Oh, my gosh! That isn't true. - That's what they all say. - And that's just a tired cliche! No one can rape Erica, she's too eager to do it voluntarily. And I would never do something like that! - You may not even like women. - I do, but ... - But... ? - I've never... it's hard to explain. There's no need, it's apparent, despite anything you might say. My father says Mikkelsen would make an excellent Headmaster if he wasn't gay. Oh, my gosh! - Is that your favorite expression? - Come on, Lina, we'll be late again. - They're shouting "Fuck Lund" today. - It's getting on television that excites them. - Should we intervene? - No, it's a lawful demonstration. - What's that? - Vegetables. Vegetables? - You do know what vegetables are? - Yes. But what will you do with them? - Break windows and throw them at the police. - You can't do that! Do not, dare not, can not! Words that you use too often. Not the cauliflower! You demonstrate for freedom by throwing vegetables at the heads of policemen? They beat us with their batons! - Now should we intervene? - Not for a tomato. - Now you're painting a car? - No war, peace on earth! A complaint from the Embassy... In the name of the King, clear the street! Stop that! Let her go! Dear God... The woman we choose for Mikkelmax must be of the highest quality. Pull down the blinds and turn on the projector. - Lily, 22 years. Hobbies: dancing. - She's not Mikkelmax's type! - You can jump on her! - That's my big sister! - Then we'll keep it in the family! - Let's see the next one. - He doesn't need a grandmother! - It isn't set yet. Her daughter, Birte, 22 years. Loves a good meal and a good fuck. - Is she anemic? - Let's see the next one. This is Maria. Virgin, a maid. She has liberal interests. - Okay... why not Maria? - Some of us also want to have her. - You mean you want to have her! - You're right... Listening Post to Headquarters... Be quiet! - "Door Mat" is on its way. - Turn it off! Open the curtains! "I should, you should ..." - Let's go! - Wait, hold on... Has he gone? - "... he should..." - It's pronounced, "you should"! I know, Professor Holst. "You shall have a kick in the ass!" - He's gone. - Condition Green... I have one more candidate. Close the curtains, and turn on the projector. Nadia, 22 years. Doesn't speak Danish, but would do well anyway. - Occupation: Sex. Interests: Sex. - She's absolutely wonderful! - Give me her address! - She's the one! The problem is she's a stripper. Something this beautiful isn't going to be free. What does she charge? I can probably get a discount for old times' sake. - How much? - We can chip in 20 apiece! Why should we pay for Mikkelsen to get laid? All in favor of Nadia and Mikkelmax? Then it's settled! Hello! Hello again! The new Headmaster has been arrested for rioting in the streets. You were wonderful. The knight who rescued the maiden from the dragon. - That's how it is with us barricade fighters. - You dropped like a log. - I didn't belong there. - Let me know how I can repay you. - We still don't care for capitalism. - The toilet is to the right. - What is it? - Nothing. Well, if you have a problem, you can tell me. I need to be married in one month. Or at least engaged. - Otherwise, you won't become Headmaster? - I can't ... - You can tell me. - Thanks! - I told her father that ... - My father? My father? No, your father! - ... that I have a girl. - But you haven't? - No. - None at all? - You've never had anyone? - Never... That's fantastic! You're just the type. - Yes, I suppose so. - You just lack confidence, ... - ... but you can acquire it. - In one month? - Sure! I'll help you. - Thank you. - First, you need to buy some new clothes. - Yes, these are terrible. - Can you mend this? - No, it's hopelessly outdated! - A more modern look will give you charisma. - Thank you for helping with my problem. - But I won't go to bed with you. - You what? Oh, my gosh! Please come with me, sir. Who's that? It's someone we don't know. Max, what's important is what you make others believe. Self-confidence comes from being self-confident. Remember that. See you. Bye for now... - I see you've changed. - Yes, the clothes make the man. When I asked you to get a girl I didn't mean that you should rape the Board President's daughter. Who told you that, Headmaster? - Mrs. Renan personally called me up. - I see... - But that's not proof. - It isn't! - The other daughter is a good friend? - Yes, we've been in prison together. The projector and speaker are ready. Have you drawn all the curtains? Yes, we're all set. - Olga calling Bertha! - He's on the way up. Contact me when he walks through the door. He's coming through the door. He sees the box. Now he's reading the note. "To Professor Mikkelsen, with friendly greetings from the boys." Who... ? What... ? Where... ? - Do you speak German? - Nakopenda. Nako...? Do you speak English? Nakopenda... Do you speak French? Put on the music. Turn on the colored lights. He ran! - Michael, he ran? - He didn't do anything with her. Excuse me! I didn't see you. I apologize... - Is that you, Professor Mikkelsen? - I apologize... I have to run! - Why did he do that? She's really cute. - Cute? She's gorgeous... and a professional! He's afraid of women. Lina, go to the Ball and look after him. - I'm sick and tired of that old fashioned school. - I'll still be going there in the next century. Lina, come take a look. What do you do with a guy who only thinks of the birds and bees? - I need to go and try on my gown. - Don't be late. Be kind to your little brother and go to the Ball with Max. - How did he end up buying a new suit? - A new suit? What are you suggesting? - He's being damned smart! - Yes, but not smart enough. Attention! The Headmaster! The Ball is open! Headmaster ... I need to speak with you. It's important... and personal. - In the midst of the Ball? - I really need to speak with you. How can I get engaged or married... in just one month? - People get engaged in ten seconds. - Yeah, but not me! Strength, stamina and courage. When I took my first test I got some good advice ... ... I was nervous about my degree ... from your father. - That won't help. - Yes, a single glass won't hurt. Don't sip. Drink it down! You'll find it makes the music sound better. The last dance before the break. Has anyone volunteered? It's traditional for a senior class student to dance the Mazurka with the Headmaster's wife. - Erik? - I'm exempt from gymnastics and dancing. Ole? Michael? - What about you? - No volunteers. Then the knife will decide. - Thanks. I'll have one more. - Another glass won't hurt. One has a chance to meet girls at the Ball. Karstenskjold girls, and Barneweller's daughter, Lina. - No, she's not here. - Then the eldest daughter, Erica de Renan. No! I didn't mean that. - Then you've met her, too. - Cheers! - Yes, the music actually sounds better. - The senses are sharpened. Michael is out. Ole, it's just us two left. - They're lining up. All the parents are there. - Come, sir... - You dance most excellently. - The Mazurka is the only dance I know. With rubber legs! Strength and stamina, Max! - No ... it cheated! - The steel doesn't lie. I don't dare. She's seen me naked. - And now she'll return the favor. - The Mazurka is a courtly dance! - I'll give you my Danish-Caribbean #66 if you do it! - Is that all you've got to offer? - This is Crimson, for a lousy Mazurka! - Okay, then! Afterwards! When the dance is over. Now we've come to the Mazurka! Get ready for the Mazurka! - I guess I'm the new owner. - You didn't dance with the redhead! I can't be blamed if Mikkelmax cut in. - Isn't this contrary to tradition? - Not if it's the new Headmaster! - This is extortion, pure fascism! - Let's have it. - Professor Mikkelsen, what is it? - I'm afraid ... - Are you drunk? - Yes... quite drunk! In front of all the parents! Where's my husband? - He's sleeping. - Is he drunk, too? Yeah... back in his office. - Go to bed now. - Yeah... bed. Take off your shoes, Professor Mikkelsen. - Did you hear what I said? - Yeah, yeah... It's stuck! He's making love to me in time to the Mazurka! Fire! - What's all the excitement? - It's one of the "Door Mat's" fire drills! Yes sir, Professor Holst! It's just a drill... a joke. Goddamnit! Professor Mikkelsen... Fire! Fire! Wake up, Mikkelson... fire! Put on your equipment, and don't forget the mask! - Well... good evening, Mrs. Bosted. - Good evening. - Care to dance? - Yes, thank you. Mazurka? No reason to get excited. Just a drill... a joke. Mikkelmax let us down. Nadia went out as pristine as she entered. - Now you're exaggerating! - We want our money back! The problem is that Nadia does not intend to return the money. She says the contract is a binding agreement. She's saving to open a vegetable store. - We also paid for travel and lodging. - That was part of the agreement. - What did she take us for? - She took us for a bunch of horny boys. But she's willing to keep the money in exchange for services owed. With whom? According to the contract, we're prohibited from getting a refund. - Then who? - Yeah... who? - Mikkelmax doesn't want her. - No, he aspires to be Headmaster. - I could sacrifice myself. - I'm willing... You're forbidden from physical exertion. - How about me, then? - Oh, shut up! Okay, we'll let the knife decide. Erik is out. And B?rje is out. It is my duty to present the prize to the lucky winner! - When can I... ? - Feel free to open your gift. Ole, can we exchange? No, I've outgrown that stuff. Ole? - Where are you going? - We're taking a walk. I'm free right now. You go get some fresh air so that I talk to the young lady here. "To Professor Mikkelsen, with friendly greetings from the boys." I've lost again. - Is Professor Mikkelsen in? - Up in his room... - Hi, Lina! - Am I disturbing you? - I was just going out. I have class. - Without your pants? - I just sat down to grade some papers. - I want to show you something. - Perhaps you're not alone? - Oh, the toilet tank is filling a little late. Why don't you wait outside? - Okay, I'll wait. - I'll be right out. - What do you think? - This is yours? - Yeah... Papa got it for me. - I thought that you were a Communist. He wants me to have interests other than demonstrating. - Get in! - Me? Yeah... come on! - This is really nice! - You need to learn to drive it. - Learn? Why? - So you can borrow it someday, Max. It impresses the girls. - Including you? - No, I'm impressed by other things. - You shouldn't do this for me. - I promised I'd help you. - This is the starter. - A short ride, then. - What do you think about that? - I think we've found the stripper's replacement. Do you still have the Danish-Caribbean #66? - Put me down! What are you doing? - You said I raped you ... ... and I have to live up to my reputation! What will you tell the Headmaster now, Mrs. de Renan? That I was raped twice by the Professor Mikkelsen. - Twice? - You'd better get busy then, hadn't you? Is Mikkelsen to be the new Headmaster? Yes or no? - You ought to know. - Me? - Yes, he's seeing your daughter... I mean daughters. - No! That can't be true! - So? - It was nice of you to come. - I was curious. - So am I... - Is today the day? - Yes, it's today. Does the prospective Minister of Culture care to make a statement? I feel that I must remain in my current position until further notice. No, I'm still not married or engaged. But I've done everything else. Thank you for showing me the way. It has really paid off. Absolutely! Life is something really special. But I can't do this. - Not this way. - But Max, it was a condition. I've been thinking, Lina... I wasn't meant to become Headmaster. Traitor! - What did he say? - What do you think? - You won't become Headmaster? No, you were right. This is only an indoctrination institution! Max, you are an idiot! - He isn't going to be Headmaster. - After everything we've done? After all the expense! - Then we have no choice. - How's that? They will get engaged. And they'll get engaged now! - Here comes Lina. - The utility shed! Get them in there! - To the Listening Post! - Lock the door! - Hi, Sis, where are you going? - Home. Not in the middle of the party! It just can't be done! I can do what I want! Okay, then. Take this path, and you'll avoid the main entrance. It's you that we want, Mr. Mikkelsen! You're betraying us, aren't you, Max? - You want to have girls at this school, Max? - Girls? - My sister wants to see you! - Lina? Really? Where is she? She went in there! I think she's still in here! Lina? Why are you sitting there? That's why. - It's locked. - That would seem apparent. It's also locked. We're prisoners. - And you knew nothing about this? - No! You don't want to be locked up with me? Who will be your successor, then? Good question. Good question. For the time being, I'll remain as Headmaster. - Did something happen to affect your decision? - Yes... well, no. It's not due to something that has happened. Just the opposite. I'm angry because you've given up. You wanted to be Headmaster. - The boys will be okay, but not the school. - Then do something about it. You can do it, Max. But you can't give all your time. - You've shown me there's so much more to life. - And it's time you did something about it. I tried everything, even showing my displeasure. One can point out what's wrong, but if the problem is to be fixed, it must be come from within. And now is your chance to fix it, Max I think you should say yes. For your own sake, ... ... and for boys' sake, ... ... and for everyone else. This is the first time I've seen your legs, Lina. - My legs? - They're lovely... Turn it up! - Oh, Max... - The rest shall remain private. Time for the confrontation! - Rape? Again? - They're in the shed, Headmaster. - What's going on? - It's a commemorative gift from the students. We need to see this! Come on! It's just the boys. Professor Mikkelsen, it's time! Where are they? Headmaster Bosted! - We'd better go. - Yeah, we should, but remember where we are? - What's going on here? - Nothing at all. And I disavow any possible liability. It's Mikkelsen again. Dreadful! - Oh, my gosh! - What's going on here? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! That is to say,... my... - ... my fianc?e and I ... - We're engaged! Professor Mikkelsen! Headmaster Mikkelsen! Headmaster Mikkelsen!
