Eneko. Lord Ximeno's son. Luxa. Are you seeking the Lady's help? The lives of our people are in danger. The Franks are returning to Saraqusta. Thousands of them. They set fire to Pamplona. They looted and kidnapped our people. We, the chiefs, will take them on at Iba?eta's gorge. Yet, you are afraid. It's certain death. Ask that crucified god of yours for help. The one you all pray to. You brought a tribute. There are still those who remember our customs. Blood for blood. I'll shed the blood of our enemies. And shed mine if necessary. You know where to find her. Deep underground. Nobody says her name anymore. Do you remember the Lady's name? Mari. Sacred Mother Earth I do not fear the Night Spirit The sun and the moon are your daughters And the eguzkilore flower, your gift Mari, Mother and High Lady Knows who to punish and who to reward Her serpent son dwells underground Protector of all treasures IRATI 778 AD WESTERN PYRENEES Forwards! They are here. A horde of lances! Move it! Move it! Move it! Eneko, go back to your mother. But first promise me that, when I'm gone, you will protect the vale. That you'll be a good lord. What? Promise. I promise. Father. So? Otsoa's men are waiting at the gorge. Banu Qasi's men are on horseback in the rearguard. We'll break their line. They'll see us coming under this light. Besides, the Belasko family have let us down. Relax. Trust me. Don't stop! Don't stop! Come on! Jesus Christ. What have you done, son? Ready to die. Ready to die. Ready to die! Prepare for battle! Ready to die! Ready to die! Arms at ready! No mercy! No mercy! Blood... for blood. Father! Eneko! Eneko, let's go! Hey, you! Are you dead? Hey! Where are they? Who? A lady, with red eyes and bird's feet. - A lamia? Where?! - In the water. - Get off! - Are you nuts? They'll eat you. Get off! You're a chicken. And you're a muddy toad. I'm Irati. You? I'm Eneko, of the Ximenez family. The Lord of the vale's grandson. Father! Son. Your father fulfilled his mission to protect our people. Too much blood has been shed. Lad... you're the last of the Ximenezes. You'll have to be strong to become lord of the vale. He'll head towards Bigorra tomorrow. They'll educate him in the new Christian faith there. Until he can become a leader. As for you, Oneka... Fort?n ibn Qasi has asked for your hand. Let me go! Old law! Blood for blood! 15 WINTERS LATER Steady, Itzal! Father. - Whack, whack! - Christ, my God! - Whack, whack! - Flesh and blood! - Whack, whack! - Free from sin! Whack, whack! Tree down! Idiot! Hurry up with the timber. Lad, are you eating that? Look... there isn't even enough for broth. Why did you kill it? Do you hear its little heart? It's stopping. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. A tiny, weak heart. Just like yours. What if yours stopped too? There's enough of you for broth. Hey! Mart?n! You wanted to kidnap him? Move along, sir. Four and a half against one isn't fair. Why would an outlander care? 15 winters make a Ximenez an outlander? Ximenez? Young Eneko? Hold your dagger. Screw your pity, Christian! Don't give them a reason to flay you. Welcome, lord of the vale's grandson. You pagan hag! Has Ximeno granted you permission to cut down trees? My good sir, I'm Od?n, domine Belasko's chief of works. Gather up and leave, unless you want to taste the Lord of vale's sword. Of course. Forgive us. Thank you so much... domine. Well done, Itzal. That's enough. Grandfather awaits. I said 24, I only see 20 here. Gratissimum iuvenis, Eneko cognomento Arista. Pater Virila. No formalities. And save your prayers for him. How is he? He has a fever, but... he's calm now. Your mother nursed him last night. She arrived from Tudela yesterday. She's eager to see you. Tired of waiting for my son, rather. Mother. Assalamu alaikum, Lady Oneka. It was reckless to come alone. I could have sent an escort. I didn't want to draw attention. You look like a highlander. The new lord of the vale must uphold his reputation. We're among snakes. As long as I am the regent by order of Ximeno, everyone's welcome here. Even Belasko. The other chiefs arrive tomorrow for your appointment. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, please. Come in while your grandfather sleeps. You can't rest without wine. Pater! The Lord of the vale isn't in his bed! What? Check the chapel! In nomine Patris... Patris... et Filii... et Spiritus Sancti... My child. Is it really you? No. It can't be. You're damned, underground. Ximeno, he's your grandson, Eneko. Lad. Virila, tell Christ to forgive my sins. Yes, friend, free your soul. In nomine Patris, et filii... God, forgive me. That old hag, Luxa... tricked us. I buried your father according to his wishes. And I threw away the Franks ?gold in that cave. Grandfather. Bury me with my son, according to Christian beliefs. Grandfather... Don't... Don't let.. Don't let that witch take me away. Ma... ri. Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis. Requiescat in pace. Someone has taken their last breath. The castle's tomb is ready for them both. Your father shall rest at last as a Christian. Ximeno should have done it, but he was always very superstitious. Oh, look who's here. Who is she? Luxa. Some people still believe in pagan tales because of her. She says these stones were placed by giants, by the jentilak. In honour of their Mother Goddess. A witch lady who fornicates with a serpent to create storms. We need a monastery in these lands. To honour the true lady. - Ready! - Sancta Mater Maria. Pull! Offence! Offence! Do not desecrate the altar! Get rid of the hag! Move it! The Lady's punishment. Pull! Pull it out carefully. Sanctus Agnus Dei. It's a tribute to Mari. You've desecrated the tomb. Witchcraft! - It doesn't seem right at all. - It's so awful. Where's my father's corpse? What is given to the earth belongs to the earth. He's sprouted horns from all that playing with the devil. Watch yourself, Belasko! Show respect or the dungeon awaits you! God has cursed your surname for flirting with the Saracens. Don't insult the Banu Qasi! My union protects us from the Franks. It's better to die by Christian sword than live under the Saracens. Don't test me! Please! Ad pacem. Belasko is right. Bloodshed leads to more bloodshed. Lady Oneka. We know the importance of your relationship with the emirate. But the lord of this land must be of pure Christian descent. What? The Holy Father in Rome instructs so. Chris will judge us. We must thank God for the Roncesvalles' victory. Rocks fell from the sky, we mustn't forget. Offence. My father gave his life at Roncesvalles! And my grandfather united us under Christian faith. Have you forgotten? Ximeno will be turning over in his grave. This is a disgrace. A Christian grandfather, but a pagan father. We had a lot of respect for Ximeno, but your lineage is no longer Christian. This is a clear sign. Young Eneko may not be lord. He's the only choice. I'm sorry, Oneka. We're Christians, this no longer concerns you. Given the circumstances... I humbly offer myself to be the pure Christian lord of the vale. Tread carefully. I could make peace with the Franks just by selling them forest wood. May your bones rot, Belasko! The forest is sacred! Shut her up and imprison her until we clear up this mess. What? No! Let me go! Let me go! We can't decide this lightly. We need time. Without Eneko Ximenez's remains, this is all we can do. We'll meet in eight days to listen to Belasko's proposal. Any objections? Thanks, lassie. Bastards! I'll get you out of here. Leave. You're in danger here. Hide! Leave. My father's corpse... where is it? Do you know? Your father made a deal and now lies in the depths of the Earth. In the High Lady's abode. I'm wasting my time. If you do not show courage, Belasko may become the lord of the vale. What did you see in the tomb? A serpent? Red... like blood? Sugaar. Lover and guardian of all the treasures passed on by the people to Mari for centuries. I don't believe in tales. But your father did. That led him to his death. What? He did it for us. - He lost his life in combat. - Yes. But he was already doomed. Shut up. Listen to her, but be careful, I don't want to lose you too. There's a deep cave in the heart of the forest You'll find your answer there. - I'll go with my guards. - No. Irati, my granddaughter, will go with you. She'll wait for you at Jentilarri before dawn. Just you two will go. How will she know? Don't worry, I'll use my magic. If you're telling the truth, I'll release you. I swear on the cross of Christ Stop with the cross nonsense! In the High Lady's abode, no crosses or prayers. With Christian gestures, you'll find certain death. - Domine. Go on, tell him. - What's your name? - Xune. - Have you told anyone else? - No. Good... little birdie. You'll be rewarded. May I be rewarded now? Yes, of course. Wait. Thanks, sir. Break her neck. And you, good old Od?n, keep an eye on Eneko. Verify what the hag said is true. My men will go with you. What if it is true? What if there's a treasure? Make sure Eneko doesn't tell anyone. Understood? I have full confidence in you, my friend. The hag wasn't lying. - Thanks. - I'm doing it for Luxa. I swear on the cross of Christ that when I'm lord of the vale... Quit your promises and let's go. It's a short day. You lived in the vale when you were a child, right? Has the cat got your tongue? I don't remember much. My father's burial. An uncivilized tradition. When I become lord of the vale, that will stop. Remember anything else? Not much. I do remember you. And you haven't changed. You're the same old bore. The path starts to get tricky now. Can you keep up without falling? As long as I'm not pushed by a muddy girl. So, you do remember. Giddy up! Giddy up, Itzal! Steady! Friend. What's the matter? He's nervous. Relax. What's the matter? The forest's sorrow distresses him. The river's full of lamiai's tears. They left once you started building your chapels and mills. Lamiai... There are no such creatures with bird's feet. A nobleman like you must have been with many women, right? Have you seen many feet? So? Yes. I know. What? Nothing. It's our business. Come on. Well done. Well done, Itzal. Come on! He likes you. He likes it when you give it nuts. How do you know that? Quiet! Listen! Hey, hold on! Quiet! - What? - Quiet! Do you not hear it? The forest's sorrow. Don't touch that Come on. Hurry up! Come on. Hurry up. This place... creeps me out. We can't get through with the horses. We'll stay back, you go. Go quietly. We're here. Is it very deep? I've never entered. Wear this. No way. The eguzkilore will protect you more than that cross. It's a darkness amulet. I'm not wearing that... Suit yourself. This way. Mari and her children. Jentilak. Lamiai. Basajaun. Mamarros. Gaueko. Do they all have names? Yes, as long as they're still remembered. Sugaar. Mari's son and lover. When they make love, storms break out that shower the valleys so that life may flourish. Follow the drawings. What is that? Who's there? You! Why are you here? Relax, there's no need for bloodshed. Just tell us where the gold is. Get out, or you'll find death. Is four against two fair this time? Show respect! - Did you hear that? - You've lost your minds. Listen. You arrogant bastard! Ratbags! Where's the gold? Berex! Berex? Berex? Let's get out of here! Let's get out of here! Let's get out of here! Eneko! Eneko! Eneko! Eneko! You're one of ours, sister. We can't hurt our own kind. Leave! - Eneko! - Quiet! Silence! Quiet! What was that? It ate Berex and Munia! You've brought us to death! It called you sister. Get her! Here! Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus... Father. I heard you pray. Don't ever do that in my house again. Why are you here? No one comes anymore. Don't you turn your back on me! And answer... Eneko. Are you looking for the gold? No. Not you. Greed hasn't brought you here. I'm looking for my father. I remember him. Where's his corpse? Answer! The day your father came to me, the rivers were covered with blood. But, in exchange, he shed his own blood. That's not true. It was his will. I couldn't refuse. He knew my name. Few remember. And I'm falling into oblivion. And you, do you remember my name? Mari. I won't kill you despite your faith being the reason for my weakness. You're wearing my protection flower. I need to find my father's remains. And leave. That's all. Those are two requests. And both you will get as long as you meet two conditions. Human greed destroys the forest, the last refuge for my children. Bring me the blood of those responsible. Their leader and executioners. I'll give you your father's corpse in return. And the second condition? Eneko! She's of my lineage. She's the only link between both worlds. Magic, flesh and blood. She can't fall into oblivion. Protect her until I go looking for her. If you harm her, I'll find you and capture your shadow. I'll use my last strength to end you all. You'll pay with your blood. As your father did. Do we have a deal? Yes. I swear. Get her! What's that? - A lamia. - Cut her feet off. Move! Irati... Rest up. You have a nasty wound. Thank you. It's no big deal. We're even. How did you escape? Mari. I saw her. What does she look like? Mari. I don't know how to explain it She was... She was... Fire... My father's tales... were true. They were all true. - And his corpse? - She has it. And she'll return it But she's asked me to commit a heinous act in return. She wants the forest desecrators. Leader and executioners. Belasko and his footmen. How can I be a good Christian now? Heinous act or not, the Lady is fair. She's asked for something else. To protect you. You're of her lineage. You're one of them. I don't need protection. Luxa is my only family. And... have they always been like that? Luxa once told me that one night a woman appeared to her. Pregnant. Needing a midwife. She gave birth to me in the water. And I nearly drowned. The woman disappeared into the river and abandoned me, with these awful feet They're not awful. What? Your face... You look like a muddy toad. Good morning. Luxa awaits us. I know how to lure Belasko. Lady Oneka, Eneko has returned. Your father was buried with this. And the corpse? It's there. Where? In the cave. What's going on here? None of your business. Belasko. I've found my father's corpse. With the Franks ?lost treasure. Treasure? This sword? And much more. Enough to build a temple. Our families could become wealthy. As wealthy as the Pope or the Caliph. No more trees would have to be cut down. So much female participation! Only she knows the way. Belasko. I'll need help to bring back the gold. Why would you share it? To show that I'm a good Christian. Let's end our dispute. Is it risky? No. Not at all. What are we waiting for? And... were you not going to mention the man-eating cyclops? Was it all bullshit, good old Od?n? - Luxa! - It's her! That devil's whore led us to death! Belasko, what is this? The Ximenezes hid the Franks ?gold to give it to these pagans! While you starve! Is he the lord you wanted? One who feeds the Saracens with the sweat of Christians. We'd end up in the flames of hell! Lock these three Saracens in the tower! Take your dirty hands off me! Belasko! Shit-eating bastard! Death is upon you. Finally, we agree. No! Luxa! Remove her shoes! No! A beast! See! I wasn?t lying! Holy Father. Get back! I said, get back! Santa Mater Maria! Take cover! Credo in Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae. Et in lesum Christum... What is this, Mater Maria? Irati. Hold on. Pater! Witchcraft! I'm sorry. Why didn't you come for me sooner? You had to live in order to be loved and remembered. And so that, through you, they also remember me. What now? Everything's lost But we'll rest in the sleep of oblivion. Finally... you shall unite with me... With your mother. And Luxa? Is she here? Luxa... The last person who sang for me. She'll feed the soil and worms. She'll become a part of the forest she loved. Just as she wanted. And the forest? I no longer have the strength to protect our home. I barely have enough to take my children with me. That's all. I'll bring you the desecrators. I won't be able to take you with me. Is that what you want? If so, daughter... open your eyes... and go. Don't you know the way? - I followed Eneko. - You better find that cave. Look! He's awake! You hit him too hard. Water! Great Now show us the way to the cave. Hold him against a tree! You only need one eye to show us the way. Go on. She knows the way! Get her! That's not the cave. Get fire and go and get the girl. Go. Gold! Domine, gold! Load the sacks! Glory to the new lord of the vale! No! No! No! Santa Maria! You're here again. But you've not met the two conditions. Instead of you, it's my daughter who's paid the tribute. Irati... Wait. Belasko! Blood... ...for blood. "Sancta Maria... ora... pro nobis peccatoribus" "Sancta Maria ora pro nobis peccatoribus" Send me a sign, please. Mater Maria... Maria. Sancta Mater Maria. Gratia plena. Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus... Et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. Pater! Come and see this! Miraculum! Miraculum, domina Oneka! Irati. I thought I had lost you. She's gone. Nobody will remember her now. No. We will. We'll remember her together. No, I'm not going back there. You're not coming? You have your place, with your people. You'll stay here... alone? I'll never be alone in the forest. Is that what you want? It's what I owe. I promised my mother. And you promised your father. Goodbye, Lord Eneko. Irati... Forget my name and never utter it again. For as long as you are the Lord of the vale. Irati! Irati! Irati! Irati! Irati! Irati! Irati! Irati! Itzal. RONCESVALLES, ORI, OCHAGAV?A - Glory to Lord Eneko! - Glory! Hail the Ximenez family! Hail!
