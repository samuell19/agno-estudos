[SCREAM] -I want my baby. Can't you hear me? I want my daughter. This isn't my hospital. This isn't my hospital. -It'll all be over soon. -No! Please, please, not without seeing my baby. I want to see my baby! No! No, it's not! It's me! It's me! -You'll be just fine. -No! Please help me! Please, my baby. -More Demoral, please. -Doctor, help! -Push! Now, push! -Stop! Help! -Push! -You're with them! You're with them! -Push! Push! -No, you can't have him! No! No! -She doesn't want to let go of him. You've got to push. -No! [SCREAMS] -A beautiful baby girl. [BABY CRYING] -Don't touch the child. You should be resting. -I'm taking my baby out of here. -I told you you didn't have anything to worry about. Why don't you go back to bed and lie down? It's the Demoral. It takes a few hours to wear off. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHTER] [CHATTER] -It's really, it's unbelievable. I mean, every time she walks into a room I hear chimes. -You should. Her bell has been rung more times than Notre Dame. -We'd all be on a four day work week. -You have to look at it from another point of view. I mean, if she lives with him, she's psychotic. If she divorces him, she's neurotic. -Repetition is a bore. But for the next 20 odd years, I don't want anybody to say that I forgot, that it wasn't my responsibility, that I had more important duties. There should be nothing more important than the proper raising of the child. The toys she plays with, the book she reads, her education, opportunities, friendships. Her every moment, asleep or awake, should be guided and protected. The child is ours. -I know. -Whatever happened to that sunny day we were supposed to have? -We still might have it. It's just a passing shower. -Where's the boss? -In the back room. -Thanks Mary. -Oh, Mr. Schreiber, I know I promised them to you for yesterday. I do, I do understand your-- I know your customers are screaming. Tomorrow. Tomorrow, all right? Oh, Mr. Schreiber it is a pleasure to do business with a man like you. Mr. Schreiber is unhappy. -Mr. Schreiber is only happy when he's unhappy, I think. -Nice. Nice. Just delightful. That's fantastic. That one. That-- oh no, too cute. Great. Beautiful. Oh! -I get it, you sort of like them. -You have a talent for coming up with the right thing at the right time. You're positively uncanny. Beatrice! Beatrice! BEATRICE: You gotta yell? -Only because you're going deaf. And Schreiber is screaming for his patterns. -Schreiber is you're problem. You're mine. -But I promised them for him first thing tomorrow morning. -It's noon already. -The three of us can do it. -6 o'clock I go home. Aw, Beatrice, not even for me? -Not even for you would I keep my Maurice waiting one minute. -Don't stand there! Start cutting. -I'm cutting. -Mary? Mary? -What is it? -Can you work late? -Uh-uh. -Well, let me put it another way, I have a problem. Therefore you are-- [CRASH] -Uh-oh. Jessica! Jessica! Jessica, someone just smashed into your car. -Oh no! -Cut. -Cut, cut, cut. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] -Oh, is this your car? -Did you do that? -I am sorry about this-- -Do you realize that car's only got 600 miles on it? -You know what, I was coming in and I just got a little bit too close-- -How could you do such a stupid thing? -I just got a little bit too close-- -This car is brand new I just bought it! -I went to turn the wheel in one way and it just went the other way-- -It's only got-- -600 miles on it. I know, I'm sorry. -I suppose you think that's funny. -Well, just a little. -You are the most inconsiderate bumbling fool I've ever met in my life. -Well, actually, we haven't met. My name is uh-- -Excuse me, I don't want to be rude, but I don't care what your name is. Just take a good look at my car-- -Lady, now calm down, it's just a bent fender. It's not the end of the world, for crying out loud. -OK. What are you going to do about it? -Well, I, uh-- I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to go to my van. I'm going to find the insurance policy, find a local agent and have them fix it. It's as simple as that. -OK. Could you do that now for me, please? -Sure. Coming right up. Be right back. -I'll wait right here. -OK. Say, look, I know it's-- Aha. See? -I'm waiting. -Well, I'll tell you what. I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. -No jokes, please. -First the good news. Found the policy. But-- -But? -It expired about two months ago. -That is just marvelous. You know you really are the most irresponsible, unorganized, inconsiderate-- -Inconsiderate, selfish, bumbling fool you've ever met. You know something? You're a terrific judge of character. -Excuse me, could you please tell me what you're going to do about my car? -Well, uh, I'll tell you what. You've got your key? -Yeah. -If you got to use it, OK, but would you please be careful with it? Because everything I own is in there. Now, please, just take care and do anything you want to it. and I'll hurry back. I'll give it back in no time. -I just got this car three weeks ago! It took me three weeks to learn how to drive it? -Don't worry about it I'll get it back. -If you break it my insurance will go up! I-- -You gave him your car? -He gave me his for security. Besides, he has an honest face. -Well so did the Boston Strangler. -I trust him. -Oh, darling, t there are a few things you have to learn about men. -Yes, teacher. -Now you repeat after me. All men are demanding. -All men are demanding. -All men are self serving. -All men are self serving. -All men are insensitive. -Not my Maurice. -Especially your Maurice. -You know a little less about men than you know about patterns. -Finished. -Tired? -Exhausted. -Two hours ago I was exhausted. Now I'm dead. -Oh, stop complaining. You said 6 o'clock. Look, 6 o'clock. -Uh-huh, uh-huh. -Goodnight. -Night. -How am I going to explain this to Maurice? -Explain what? -That I have a headache. You've got a headache? -Your carriage is as good as new, Madame. A little better since I had it washed and waxed. -I don't believe it. Nothing gets fixed in one day in San Fransisco. Absolutely nothing. How did you do it? -A little charm. And an extra $50. -I'm sorry, but it really was your fault. -Look, I banged up your car, so I feel I owe you just a little bit of something. So how about having dinner with me tonight? -Thank you, but I don't want go out to lunch, or dinner, or anything with strangers. -You're right. My name is Andy Stewart and-- -Goodnight Mr. Stewart. -No, but, but it's not dutch treat. I'll pay. Hey, I mean it, honest! -Hi. It's 7:15 and I'm hungry. If you want dinner, call me at 4,7,4, 3, 9,9,8. Andy. -Jessica Gordon? -I should be so lucky. Jessica? Jessica? For you. -Who's it from? -I don't know. -I don't believe it. -What is it? -It's a menu. -A what? -A menu. The boy who bumped into my car. -What does it say? -2:00 PM and starving. I think he's crazy. -I haven't eaten for 29 hours, Miss Gordon. -How do you know my name? -I know your name, your address, your phone number, your zip code, and your motor number. Actually it's your cars motor number. -My driver's registration. -How about dinner? You choose the place. -Please give up, Mr. Stewart. -I haven't even started to work at it. -If I do go to dinner with you, will you promise not to leave any more messages on my phone machine? -It's a deal. What would you like? -The menu you sent me. Have you ever been there? -I only got in town yesterday. I haven't been anywhere. -Why don't we try it? [SPEAKING JAPANESE] -I just, I thought I'd order ahead, just on the chance that you'd come. -I just got in town yesterday, I haven't been anywhere? -Just wanted to make an impression, honest. -Where did you ever learn Japanese? -I spent a couple of years in the Orient. -Were you born there? -Nothing quite that romantic. I was born in a small town in Kansas. How about you? Are you a native of San Francisco? -No, I've only been here for two years. I was born in New York. -Well, you see how much we have in common? Neither of us i born here. A little more Sake? -No, thank you. I'm fine. I never knew my mother. She died during childbirth, I was told. And I never could find out who my father was. But for an orphan, I've been awfully lucky, really. -You don't have to be lucky to be a model. All you have to have is high cheekbones and long legs. -I'm not a model. I'm a designer. -At 22? -I told you I was lucky. It's like I have this guardian angel that is watching over me and he seems to have more helpers than Santa Clause. -Well, that's not a bad thing. -When I was six I lived with this fabulous woman. I used to call her Aunt Irene. We lived in New Orleans. Then I won a scholarship to school. I got a job in New York at a top fashion house. And the very next year some man, I never even knew who he was, arranged for me to have my own showing. And the next thing you know, here I am in San Fransisco. -I want to know something. Where was this guardian angel of yours when I bumped into your car? -Watching? -I like your eyes. -I don't care for compliments, thank you, unless they're honest. -When I lie my ears turn red. -Well I'm going to watch for that. -Success seems to come really easy to you, doesn't it? -I don't know. Besides, being a success means you're the best at what you do. And I'm not yet, I'm still learning. There's still thousands of things I want to do. -Like what? -Travel. See Paris, France. Live there for awhile. Hong Kong and see the rest of the far east. -Interested in oriental design, huh? -For my work they use the colors, the drapes, the textures. Design is all fascinating. -You know, I've got some books in my van I bet you'd be real interested in looking at. -Andy? -What? We've been together for maybe two, two and half, maybe three hours, and I know next to nothing about you. -What? I'm single. I'm a freelance writer living alone in San Francisco, until I met you, that is. -Your ears are turning red. Seriously. You know everything about me, even my motor number. -All I am is locked in my van. And while you're looking at the art books, I'm going to tell you the fascinating story of the life and the times of Andrew Stewart. Come on. -Oh, wait a minute! Nice try. -Jess, what'd I say? -I've been trying for three days now. -You're gaining ground. -Whenever I make a move, you change the subject. -I guess I just don't want to end up as one of those girls in one of your stories. -Now wait a minute, I'm not that kind of a writer. -What kind of a writer are you? -You did it again. -Well? -I write for magazines. You know, travel brochures and sunday supplements and stuff like that. Anything that kind of keeps me moving around. -Agnes said you were a drifter. -She would. No, I didn't mean that. No, my father had a small newspaper and he died before I got back from Nam. So I sold it and I spent some time in the Far East and Europe. I've hit about 19 states in the past 12 weeks, which explains why my insurance policy lapsed. -Doesn't explain it to me. -Well, you'd be surprised how long it takes my mail to get from one general post office to another. Here, cheers. -How about it? -Don't tell me you believe in that junk. -Oh, are you kidding? I sure do. I even charge my battery by Tinkerbell. Two fortunes, please. -Do I hear the sound of silver coins? -Coming right up. -Let's have it. -The music that makes men dance. -Fortunes and philosophy, all for the same price. -What's your name, honey? -Jessica, Jessica Gordon. -For you. -Thank you. -OK what does yours say? -In the second millennium, the child of the child shall inherit the earth and havoc shall reign. What does yours say? -Says you are going to get the Nobel Prize in literature, own three houses, two cars, one yacht and marry a girl you met in San Fransisco a week ago yesterday. -Come on, really. Come on, show it to me. Andy, come on. -Oh no. -Andy, come on now. I showed you might. Play fair. Let me see it! -No! No! No, no! All right, I'll tell you. I'll tell you. -OK. -It says, I love you, Jessica. -Jessica! I love you! I love you, Jessica! Jessica! I love you! -John Wayne, you're not. -Listen, lady. This is a lot of horse. -Andy! -Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! -Andy! Andy! -Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! -Andy! -Whoa! Whoa! -Andy! Andy! -I know that I've seen him someplace before. At the shop, in New York. I just can't remember where. -We're just lucky he was there. -We're lucky? What about him? He saved my life and got killed for doing it. -Honey, it's not your fault. It was just a damn stupid accident. -Please, Andy, I just have to be alone tonight. I've gotta be by myself. -I can't believe you're being this way. -Please, Andy. Go away, Please. -It's not my fault. It's not even the horses fault. Jessica! -Go away Andy. Please. -You don't mean that. -I mean it. -Jessica, look, I'm sorry about the guy that got killed, but what does that have to do with the way we feel about each other? -I don't feel anything. -The hell you don't. -Look, Andy, it's over. -Why? -Because I'm bad news. Don't you understand? I'm bad for any man. -Because a stranger got killed? -Andy, he's not the first. He's the third. -Third what? -The first time I was only 16. I met a boy in art school. We were friends, good friends. He committed suicide. -A lot of people comm-- -And just last winter I met a man at a party. We dated. He was killed in a hunting accident. -Were you there? -What do you mean, was I there? What difference does it make? Don't you see that every time I get close to a man he dies? -I still say it was just a coin-- -Please go away Andy. Just go away. Go home, leave me alone. Please, go away. -No, Jessica, damnit. Not with a door between us. If you want to get me out of your life, then you're going to have come out here and look at me and tell me. -Go away, Andy. -Do you mean that? -Get out of my life. -I'll always love you, Jessica. -Want to talk about it? -No. -It's not exactly a secret. -I said, I don't want to talk about it. -Look, for the last three days you have been slamming doors, ripping up designs, and yelling at everyone. -Agnes, please don't push me and don't nag at me. -I am just trying to talk some sense into you. I told you the first time I laid eyes on him what he was all about. -You don't know anything about him. -Well I know that he walked out on you. And good riddance. -He didn't walk out on me. I sent him away. -But that's even better. Oh Jessica, please, trust me. I know that he's not for you. Where are you-- Come back here! Jessica! -Andy? Andy? Andy? Andy? I love you, Andy. -[SPEAKING LATIN] [SPEAKING LATIN] -Oh, Astaroth, the Prince of Darkness. Ever since I evoked you from the blackness I have been your servant. Immortality will be mine. So long as I serve you, obey you, and fulfill your every wish. As you have commanded, the parent vessel for the mortal child that you want to father with you, she is virginal in body and mind, carefully nurtured to perfection. Show me a sign, Astaroth. For by the oath I swear, the time is now. -Come on, Jessica! Jessica Stewart! -Father Wheatley! -Hell fire and damnation! -Sorry about that. -It's OK. Cussing is a bad habit of mine. One of many. -Jessica Gordon, Father Wheatley. -Ooh, your hands are cold, Jessica. That means you've got a warm heart, of so they'd have us believe. Well you're right, Andy. She's as pretty as a spring morning. Say, are you any good at sign painting? -Uh- uh. Awful. -You, my dear? -I'm afraid not. -Oh, pity. Still the good Lord will provide. Come in, come in. I'm in sore need of a cleaner, too. You have no idea how dusty this place gets. But that's my problem. Your concern is the wedding, right? When is it to be? -Next Wednesday, Father. Right? Jess, what are you doing out there, honey? Come on in. Come on. -Are you OK? -I'm cold. -I hope the heater hasn't given up the ghost. -It's freezing. -I better check it out. Why don't you two go out in God's warm sunshine? There's a nice little garden out there. -OK Father. -Andy? -Yeah, Father? -I wonder if you'd mind-- something has come up. Very important. Could I speak to you tomorrow? -Sure, father. Come on Jess, let's go. -A little more wine, Madame? -Just a touch. -You know something, I've got some stuff back home in storage, a stereo, some pictures, and a couple of Tiffany lamps. -Everything will fit just perfectly. -A highboy chest. um, morris chair with a lace doily and my father's old moose head. -Oh, Andy. -I'm only kidding. -In that case, it's time for the surprise. -Hm? I'm rather proud of my cool. -You've been dying of curiosity, admit it. -Only on the inside. -Well, come on. -Oh. -Come on. -Well? -Hey, where did you find it? -I've had my eye on it for about six months now, only it's, uh, too big for one person. -I sleep on the right side. -Well, perfect, because I sleep on the left. -Oh, man. I see you like a firm mattress. -It's great for the back, you know. -There's only one thing, I like privacy in my bedroom. -How'd he get in here? -Well I know how he's getting out. Hey, cat, get. Come on, cat. Come on. -No, I'll take him. I'll take him. Come on, baby. Go on, go find yourself a playmate. -Come back to bed. Do you love me? -Yeah. -How much? -Forever and ever. -Andy. -I'm busy. -Oh, Andy. -What? -Have you ever been in love before? -That's a dumb thing to ask. -Well, have you? -I loved a girl in New Orleans. Her name was Linda Isley. And that's been, uh, oh, I don't know how long it's been. -As long as it's over. -Andy, at least postpone the wedding. -But, Father, I don't understand what-- -Neither do I. It's just that, I do know that she's been touched by Astaroth. -By who? -The devil, Astaroth. -Father, come on. Is this some kind of a joke? -No. No, I looked it up. The signs are all there. That unnatural chill, that cold wind that came sweeping through the church. -Yeah, but these old buildings are all like that. -No, no. When she passed the altar, the darkness came. -You're serious? Oh, come on Father. I can't get involved in your superstitions. Yes or no? Will you marry us tomorrow or not? -Would you would least delay until I can contact Father Kemschler. He can answer-- -Who is this Father Kemschler? -He's an authority on, on the Book of the Dead, and Satan, and the forces of evil. -I think we'll have a civil ceremony. Good bye, Father. -Brawn was a bumbler. I mean, he was devoted and conscientious, but the man was inept. I'm sure you'll agree with me that he could have protected Jessica without sacrificing himself. -But that doesn't solve the present problem, does it? -No, oh no, no, no, of course not. Of course you're, you're right, Mr. Rimmin. The problem is Jessica. However I do think it's a minor-- minor, I can assure you that-- this, uh, this, uh, well. What, what, what, what, what should I call it? A uh, an infatuation. That's it, that's perfect. This infatuation will pass. [CATS MEOWING] -I, I promise you that. I-- I-- There's no need, no need, for concern, Mr. Rimmin. There is, there is no reason for you to have bothered yourself by, by coming here. [CATS MEOWING] -Mr. Rimmin, I've-- I've never, I've never, I've never failed you. I, I have had the two most difficult years-- No! Mr. Rimmin, you know my record. You know my sense of responsibility. Mr. Rimmin, Mr. Rimmin, I've never asked you for it. Please, please, please, please, give me another chance! Oh, God! Please, I've never asked you for anything just help me, just this one time. Mr. Rimmin, please, please, there has to be something you can do! Please, please, Mr. Rimmin. Please, please! Please! Please, please! [CATS MEOWING] [SCREAMS] -See you tomorrow. -11:30, and be ready. I don't want to get married without you. -OK. Bye. [BREAKING GLASS] -Oh, damn. It would have to be my bed. [CRASH] -We'll be right down. Jessica? Hey, it's the impatient groom. Jessica! Jessica! Jessica? Father Wheatley? Father? Father? [BELLS TOLLING] -Father? -Oh, Aunt Irene! Oh! -Let me look at you. -Oh, really, you haven't changed. Not a bit. -Jessica, I thought I taught you never to lie. -Really, Mr. Rimmoin, she hasn't. She's just as I remembered. -Get in the car, darling. We have plenty of time to talk. -She looks rather well, wouldn't you say? -The last time I saw her, she was all arms and legs. -I was afraid, perhaps, the post hypnotic suggestion may have made her forget me. -I merely obscured her memory of the past two years. San Francisco, Agnes. She was a warm friend of yours, wasn't she? Well, of course, she has no memory of the boy either. -Please don't think me presumptuous Mr. Rimmin, but, who does she think you are? -Why, a warm friend of yours, I guess. -Here. -Brutus! Oh, hello baby. Hello. Everything's exactly as I remember it. -I'm afraid you've outgrown your old room. -That's where I stay anyway. -Ah, well. It's been a long trip, hm? Why don't you freshen up? -I could use a hot bath. Come on Brutus. Come on. Come on. -I didn't realize how much I missed her. -Personal attachment. -I thought it was important, Mr. Rimmin, to give her emotional security. -You're quite right. This room has an old world charm that I find quite refreshing. -It's difficult, but I try to retain some of the old values. However, keeping the proper help and teaching-- -You're aware of the problem. -Agnes did mention an infatuation, but I thought she and Brown-- -You were saying? -Nothing important, Sir. -Jessica and Andrew Stewart are in love. And as long as that love endures, Jessica's union with Astaroth cannot be consummated. -In the past, when problems arose, an accident took care of it. -Yes, but it's too late for an accident. We cannot destroy him until we destroy their love. -I could think of at least a dozen ways-- -Agnes made that same mistake. -Mr. Rimmin, I'm not Agnes. I know if you involve yourself, the problem is anything but simple. -It's soluble. -Of course. -Jessica has no memory of Andrew Stewart. Now he must be made to forget her. -Yes. But how? -I believe it was Eve who first discovered the secret. She used an apple. I'll be a bit more inventive. I'll use the temptation of old love. -Ladies and gentlemen, flight number 34, service from San Fransisco to New Orleans will be arriving shortly at gate number 3. -I'm sorry, but she's-- -Look, I've got to see her! -The regulations are quite-- -Lady, I didn't fly all the way down here from San Fransisco to be stopped by some silly rule. Please. -I don't have the authority. Now her mother is in the waiting room. Perhaps she'll let you go see her. -Pardon me. -Linda? -Andy. Andy. I don't know why or how you're here but, but thank God. -Sit down. Is this your daughter? Then this is why I'm here. -You came to write a story? -No. -No more stories, my child is in pain, do you understand? She's convulsing, tearing herself apart. -I'm not here to do a story. I just want to talk. -All I've gotten from everyone is talk. Nothing but talk. I want somebody to do something. -I don't know what I can do, but-- your husband? -He died two years ago. -Andy, what am I going to do? -Just start from the beginning. There was nothing in the newspaper. -It was three or four days ago. She fell off her bike. The neighbor said she was frightened by a cat. It's stupid. She loves cats, dogs, birds. It's insane. -Had she ever drawn this before? -No. The first thing she said was that her eyes hurt. And then-- -Mrs. Dayton? -I think your little girl is going to be fine. -An hour ago I saw that-- -Her fever has broken. She's sleeping now. -Oh, thank God. I can't believe it. Cindy is fine and you're here. -I'd like to keep the girl under observation for 48 hours. -Anything you say, doctor. -Why don't you go home and get some sleep. -I think I'll feed her first. -Not a bad idea. -OK Linda, what'll it be? Antoine's, Gallatoise's? -You remember the first time we ever had dinner together? -Oh, no you don't. I am in no mood to share a hot dog. [WHIMPERING] -Everything is fine. -Oh, will you be serious for just one minute. -But I don't want to be. Cindy's better and you're in New Orleans. I don't want to hear about crazy drawings or Jessica. You sure you love her? -Yes. -But you only knew her for three weeks. Come on, let's have some wine. -No. -Champagne, champagne to celebrate your coming to my rescue. -I didn't do anything. -Shh. I don't want t hear about that. I deserved that. -I didn't mean-- -No, no, no. I really did deserve it. I sent you that stupid letter. I got married on a whim. I made one mistake after another. I don't blame you for being angry. -I'm not angry. -I would be. -Well, I'm not. -Forgive me? [DOOR CLOSING] -Is there somebody here? -No. -Where's the child? -She went into a coma immediately, is that correct? -Yes. -And she constantly drew the pentacle? -I don't know what she was drawing. -Was she talking gibberish? A foreign language? -She was talking English. -Well what did she say? Exactly, word for word. -How do I know? Mostly she mumbled. She, she said something about a child, or, or, or, a second child, or children taking of the world. I don't know. -Father Kemschler, is all this necessary? -If it weren't, I wouldn't have flown down here. -I know you're trying to help. I've got dozens of letters from people who want to help but it isn't necessary. My child is fully recovered. -I don't believe it. -Well that is your problem. The Doctor said we could bring her home in 48 hours. -I was there. -You saw her and she looked fine? No symptoms of anything? -Well we didn't exactly see her but-- -Call the hospital. -Father Kemschler, it's one thing for you to break into my house but to stand there and give me orders! That's something else. -Please, call the hospital. Is that better? -It's too bad about Father Wheatley. I never thought him a man to take his own life. -Who said he did? -The police. -I've known him all my life. He didn't commit suicide. -Are you trying to tell me that he was murdered? By whom? Why? -Three questions. You wouldn't understand the answer to any of them. [CRYING] -Father Kemschler, is all this necessary? -If it weren't, I wouldn't have flown down here. -Baby? Baby? Baby, it's mommy. Baby, my baby. My baby. [INAUDIBLE] -She's burning up. -I'll get a doctor. -It won't help. -Do you have a better suggestion? -An exorcism. -Father, we're not living in the Dark Ages. -You can prove that? -I don't want to hear philosophy. My child is desperately ill. -Unless we get her out of here and perform a right of exorcism, your child will die. -That's a hell of a thing to say. -That's pretty close to the truth. Don't talk in parables. Come out and say what you have to say. -She's in a coma. She draws the Pentagon of Astaroth. -Nobody can make any sense of those scratchings. -Her soul-- -Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I saw that sign. I saw it in Father Wheatley's church in San Fransisco. And that quote on the wall, a fortune teller gave it to us. We thought it was a joke. -That's the key to all this. The sign of the devil Astaroth in San Fransisco. The sign of Astaroth in New Orleans. You're the linking factor. Only an exorcism will tell us why. You must trust me. -Trust you? You break into my house. You scare me half to death. You tell me my baby is possessed. She's not half as sick as you are. -Perhaps she'll listen to you. -Father, that exorcism, it's admitting evil. -It's insane. My baby fell off a bike. She hurt herself. Tell him Andy. Tell him. [HAMMERING] [WHIMPERING] -Whatever you hear, whatever you think you hear, do not come into this room. Is that clear? -I'm staying here. -You're not trained. You're not prepared. You don't even believe. -All the same, I'm staying. -Then there'll be no exorcism. I'm sorry. -But what harm can there be if Andy stays? -Because I can't perform the right with anyone in this room who is not an ordained priest of God! -All right, Father. [WHIMPERING] -Your powers seem to be weakening, Astaroth. Otherwise, why choose such a frail battle ground? [LAUGHTER] -I presume you'll be showing me some more of what's left of your strength. No, Astaroth. No allies from outside. Just one on one. You and me, like the last time. Oh, you remember, huh? I will show you the power of God. Holy, holy, holy. I'll make you kneel before it. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. [SPEAKING LATIN] [SCREAMING] -It's all right. [SPEAKING LATIN] [SPEAKING LATIN] -Let God rise. Let his enemies be scattered. Let them also that hate him flee before him. [INAUDIBLE] As wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish in the presence of God. [INAUDIBLE] [SCREAMING] -No, no. [SPEAKING LATIN] -It's OK. FATHER KEMSCLHER: [SPEAKING LATIN] -I'm cold. -I'll get a blanket. Where is it? -No. It's in the hallway. Andy? What's happening out there? -I don't know, baby. [CAT MEOWING] -Andy! -Unto thee will I cry oh Lord. Unto thee oh Lord do I lift up, oh my God I trust in thee. Let me not be ashamed. Let not thine enemy triumph over me. -Father Kemschler? Father Kemschler? Father Kemschler, are you all right? [DOOR CREAKING] -Mommy! Mommy! -Pack your things. -Why? -Because we've failed. If we move her, he'll follow. -Then we'll move her again and again-- -Until what? -Until his love dies or he does. -I knew it. I knew I'd find the answer up there. -What answer? -Your Jessica has been chosen to bear the child of Astaroth. -Oh, Father, come on. You don't expect me to believe that? -You saw that poor child upstairs. You saw Father Wheatley dead. You met the presence of evil. Is it so difficult to believe? -Because there's got to be a rational explanation for everything. I know that. -You know nothing. I know that I'll never stop loving her. -And I know they'll do anything they can to stop you. -They'll just have to kill me. -You have no idea what you're letting yourself in for. You have no conception of what they can do to you. They'll your life a you living hell because they've got to destroy your love for Jessica. They may kill you. And by that time, you may want them to. -Father, this is the 20th century. Things like that don't happen anymore. -Hm. You know your Shakespeare? -Yes. Of course. -"There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy." When you need me, I'll be there. [DOOR CLOSING] -She fell asleep before she could-- You're not leaving? -I've got to find her, Linda. -But you don't even know where to start. -Jessica mentioned a Sister Monica, in New York. -I have a feeling I'm going to be making another mistake if I let you go. -You don't have a choice. -That much in love? You mind if I keep loving you? -No. -If you don't find her-- -I will. -Father?
