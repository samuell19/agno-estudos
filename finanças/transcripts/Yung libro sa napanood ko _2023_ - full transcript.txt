Thank you! Wow! What are they studying? Mandarin? Chinese noodles? Wait. Yum! Fried Chicken! She used to be a woman, right? Did you get a sex change operation? Oh my god. Don't judge. But you're a scholar right now? Study hard, alright? Lisa? Do you have a boyfriend? Oh, no! You're not getting any younger. You should stop being so picky! I'll introduce you to my neighbor's son! He's nice! Auntie, actually, you know, I'm very happy right now! I don't really want a boyfriend! Remember when I had a boyfriend and he just left me, what if that happens again? So I'd rather not. Besides, if you think about it auntie, I'm very busy with work. What about you, are you working? Are you happy? I'm happy... Maybe it's time to end this interview. Lisa, say goodbye. Auntie, we have to go. Be happy, alright? How's work? Sorry? - How's work? - Oh, it's okay. What about you, did you see your doctor last Thursday? I didn't get the chance. Shall I drive you home? No need. I didn't get to eat a while ago. I'll just drop by the convenience store. Okay. All right. Take care. I have to go somewhere and leave, please take care of our family. - So here's the tea! - What happened? Do you know how my boyfriend courted me? How? Since we met online, he started giving me P100k each month! - Wow! - Who would say no to that, right? - Do you believe this? - Of course! - She doesn't believe it! - What about you? - How are you? How's your lovelife? - Yeah, Lisa, tell us! How’s your lovelife? Wow it looks like Eiffel tower... It's a story about mother. - Oh, mother? - Do you know? Maybe... To Room 19. You read that too. It's a story of a mother taking care of her family. Did you have fun without me in Mongolia? No, I did not have any fun. Hi. Hello. How are you? I’m fine. How about you? I’m not fine. Why? Because I miss you. What are you doing here? Seo ah, I can explain. What are you going to explain? Why are you here? What? If you did not come, you would not see this. How could you do this to me? I treated you so well. Hi! Are you getting all of these? Okay. Can I pay with my card? Hi miss! What are you looking for? Miss, do you have the book 'To Room Nineteen'? - To Room Nineteen... - Yes. Sadly we haven't had that in years! I just saw finished watching that K-Drama. I thought it was new... you really don't have it? Not even in the stock room, maybe we can check? All the books in our stock room... are already displayed here. Ah. How about those books over there? You've run out of copies? You've looked everywhere, right? If you're open to try some of these here. You'll enjoy these. Thriller… stuff about Dracula... There's plenty of other options. - If you need anything, I'll be over there, okay? - Sure. Thank you! - Thank you! - Thank you, take care! Watch out for the second book, girl! Here's where we're going next! - Wow! - We'll leave early tomorrow. - Hello. - Hi! - Did you say we'll leave early? - I'm Gun Hoo Kim, I'm a fan. I really love this book... I bought this in Korea. Gun-Hoo Kim... you're a foreigner and you read Filipino authors? Yeah, I once had a Filipino classmate for a while. I see. So who do you want me to dedicate the book to? To Mary. That's a really nice name. Girlfriend? Nope. Men, am I right? Shamelessly denying their girlfriends. She's not my girlfriend. You know 'jowa'? No, I was just telling Tanya, my friend, that her boyfriend… is a... - My boyfriend! - Yeah! He's coming here, yeah? He's here, yes! So you don't have a boyfriend? Me? Okay guys, last three books for signing! We have to move on to other bookstores. Yes, thank you very much! - Thank you for the signature! - Thank you! God that was embarassing… What was I saying? Next! Welcome back to the show! My next guest is... a young, upcoming author, her book, "The Book From The Show I Watched", has been on the best-seller's list for over seven months now. And if my sources are correct, this book is going to be made into a movie. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, to Deeper With You. My guest, author, Lisa Villamor. Hi Tito Boy! Thank you so much, hi! - Thank you for being here! - Thank you for having me! You know why? I really appreciat eyou being here because, by you being here, you're sharing with us your best-seller experience! Gosh. It's my pleasure. Do you know why? Because the last time you were here, we were talking about many things, and one of which was, this book, that wasn't out yet. Yes. Now, it is a best-seller! How is that experience? Gosh, Tito Boy, I still can't wrap my head around it, and in fact, actually, I don't know how to feel. Like, the other day, I was with my handler, and we went to a book signing and I was so shocked because there was a Korean in line! Who would have thought, right? Really? I'm so glad for you. I didn't realize we had a #ProudToBePinoy moment! But if you remember our last conversation, you wrote this book after you watched a Korean series where you saw a book. Yes. My question is, have you found the book? Ah, the book was called "To Room Nineteen." Ah! So that is the book? Yes. - "To Room Nineteen." - That's the one. Have you found it? Actually, Tito Boy, I've looked everywhere. We don't have a copy of it in the Philippines. So I actually don't have a copy. Okay. But I'm sure you can find it online? I'm sure there is, Tito Boy, but I feel like I wasn't meant to find the book. So maybe one day if I visit Korea, I'll just buy it there. Meant to be! You're not just a best-seller, you're a jet-setter, too! Imagine, going to Korea for a book! Oh, no, Tito Boy, it's not like that... I still have to save! But... actually Tito Boy, there's another reason why I wanna go to Korea... My father told me before that, when I was younger, my mother brought me with her to Korea. She was an OFW then. So, yeah, I just wanted to go back there. Mmm. Okay... And see what happens, right? - Yes. - And that's the reason, why you dedicate this book to her. Yes. Ah, actually Tito Boy… How do I say this? The series I watched... the one that I told you about, the book that they featured, which was Room Nineteen, it was about a mother. And the mother would sometimes leave to look for a place, which was Room Nineteen, and when she's inside that room, she could escape the world even for a couple of hours. My mother passed away a few years ago, you see. So, I'd like to think that, hopefully, during her life, she had a place where she could escape for a little while even just for a few hours. So, yeah. I just wanted to go to Korea so I could find that place of hers, and maybe, for just a moment, I could speak with her, or feel her presence. And if you get the chance... What would you actually tell her? Mom. What would you want to know? I'll be there soon. Yeah. What if you don't find it? Yeah. Ok, bye. Ok. Ma'am, I promise you, you'll be inspired by that book! Thank you, thank you madam! See you again! - Thank you! - Thank you very much. - Next! - Next please! - Thank you, Winwin! - Nice to meet you! Thank you! Ma'am, that book will inspire you for sure! It's so life-changing! - Thank you, next! - Next please! Thank you so much! Thanks, ma'am! Thank you so much, ma'am! Thank you! - It's you again! - Hi. You know, Mary's going to be upset with you. So, you remember Mary? Actually, she won't be mad at me. Why are you leaving so quickly? Because... I'm going to eat. I'm starving, I haven't eaten yet! And you already said goodbye, I'm gonna go home! Can I come with you? Huh? Why? So I can say bye properly to you. Huh? Here. Hey! Now wait a second. Is this guy bothering you? Keep it down, he understands Tagalog. Why is he giving you a passport? Doesn't he know you're not supposed to show it? I don't know what's the matter with him. I said I was going to eat, he said he was coming too. Suddenly he's giving me his passport. Take my passport. - Why? - And my ticket. Why would I do that? So if I upset you, I won't be able to go back to Korea. Hey, why did you take... give it back! Give it back! I took it because I know you wouldn't! Dumbass! Hey, I'm not a dumbass! I mean, hello! You're watching all these K-dramas, God's putting you in one right now. He's right there! You're so annoying... Oppa! You take her to yummy food! Okay? I don’t want to. Go! I'll pick the restaurant, okay? Enjoy! You're such a sneak for not telling me you can speak Tagalog! Tell me slowly. You did not eat? No. Also yesterday, dinner? I didn't eat. That's bad. I know, I had so much work! You should always eat hot homecooked food. I know, but... well, I don't know how to cook. I can cook for you. Did you hear that, mister? This guy's drop dead in love with me. Is... who will you kill? Nobody! Why are you going to fly back to Korea already? I didn’t even go back yet, but you miss me already. What? Say what? Oh! Sorry! I forgot…I said... uhm… I have to go back to work. I just came here to visit a friend. Okay! Why don't you go to Korea? Come with me! No! I can take you to all the places where they shot the series you like. You know, the series why you wrote your book? How do you know that? I know everything. Come on! No! Come on! No, no, no! Why not? No! …And he got caught on Instagram. Sorry, wait a second! Can you please take a whole body full shot? Thank you. It’s just a cardboard. No, that's oppa from the K-drama, I love him so much! Now you understand what I said? No, I don't understand but I saw your face it was very judgemental. Say it again! It’s just a cardboard. I didn't say it like that. - It was exactly like that, I saw it. - No, no! - Yes, yes! I promise. - No! Let's go there. Okay. Yes! Thank you. One, two, three. - Okay. - Good? May I see? Thank you. Let's go. Okay. Okay. Good? - Good? - Good. Let's go home? Let's go, come on. Get your stuff. Okay. Let's go to the Airbnb that my omma recommended for you and drop your bags off? You can't bring it everywhere. Why? Why are you so bothered? I'm not even asking you to carry it for me! That's why I'm bothered, 'cause you won't let me! You know, I can manage on my own, why don't you go home and rest? We came from the airport. Go. Rest, rest. But aren't you going to eat first? And you don't even know where to go? Yes I do! You sent me a whole email of places to go! I can choose a restaurant and go on my own. I'm really okay. - Fine. - So annoying! Let me buy you dinner. What’s the first thing you wanna try here in Korea? Anything? So good! Oops, sorry! Try this, ok? No, no. Put it down! Why do you always do that? What do I do? When I do something good for you, you always refuse! Because I'm okay! I can take care of myself; I even wrote it in my book: "You have to love yourself first." Or, "You should love yourself more." You know what, I don't think you read my book. Well, it's nice to be okay when you're alone, but there's nothing wrong with asking for help. Okay. Excuse me, can I have one more please? Oh gosh! Your girlfriend eats very well. What did he say? He said you can have it, but it's better with the sauce. Alright, hold on. Okay. Excuse me sir, can I have a soybean sauce? - Soybean sauce? - Yes. Ok, soybean sauce! Thank you. - Try it with sauce, dip it. - Let's try it. Is it spicy? No, no. It's a dipping sauce. Okay. How is it? Good? So good! We are almost here... Yeah? Which is right next one. Wow, it's so big! So... What time should I pick you up tomorrow? Don't pick me up tomorrow. You have work, right? You should go to work! Actually I have one more week off. No, it's okay. I really want to explore the city alone, if it's okay. Okay? Okay. Thank you for today and take care and good night. So... The code is zero two two one star and you can also change it. Did you get it? Huh? Did you get it? Mhm! Really? Okay. Good night! Okay. Bye-bye! Okay. Good night. - Good night. - Good night! Mom. Yeah, mom. I am back. That's good. Come home. But mom I’m little bit tired so let me head back to my home first and I’ll visit you tomorrow. I swear it's like I have no children in this world! One got married and forgot the word mother, another one is here but doesn’t care if I freeze to death. Eat a lot my son try this, and this. You love this stir-fried anchovies, try it too. What do you want more? You want salad? Mom I told you I ate dinner. Why is there so much food? Look at your face, you lost so much weight. Did you not eat when you were in Manila? Didn’t I tell you to go to your Auntie Emma’s house to eat? Your Auntie Emma loves you so much! No, she's not even my real aunt. She’s just your chat mate and I know that you guys are trying to hook me up with her daughter. I don’t like it. Gun Hoo, I just want you to be happy. I just want you to be ok. Mom, I am ok. Really. I visited your sister the other day you should go there and play with your nephew more. You know he adores you. Anyways, mom. You shouldn’t eat a lot in this late night because of your high blood pressure. I’m not done yet! Ok fine! Mom I’ll do it. It’s ok. Let me do it. You will use this against me in the future. - It’s ok. Go, go away. - By the way, what’s that mom? - Oh my! Give it to me! - Why? Go away. Mommy will do it. Really? Don’t worry. Don’t come after me with this later then. Ok don’t worry. Mom. Yes? I found her. Stop crying! You're flying soon. I'm scared. - You have to promise me you're gonna follow! - We'll follow! Lisa, you should go to sleep. We have an early flight to Manila tomorrow. Ma, please... Alright, but... after that you'll go to bed, okay? You’re 25 minutes late. Yeah. But you were never late. Yeah. What’s going on? I really missed you too. Why are you so grumpy today already? Sorry. Hey, actually you know what, I’m on break till next week. So it doesn’t matter if I am late or not. But isn’t your home only takes 2 minutes from here? Do you want your present or not? Did you get it? Give it to me. Did you get my favorite? Yeah I got it even I am late. Thank you bro. Looks so yummy. I am not going back to Manila for a while so don’t finish them all. Bro, it’s so good. Try it too. Later. Come on, try it. Later. - I know you are tired.

Yeah. Sorry I just wanted to get off, because the air in the bus felt... I don't know. It was kind of stuffy? Like very recycled. So where are we right now? I don't know... the last stop of the yellow bus? Okay where is that? We're far away from the city. I don't know many restaurants here. Someone's coming... Maybe we can ask her? - Oh, okay. Hold on let me ask her. - Yeah. Excuse me ma’am! Is there a place where we can eat near here? Restaurants? You can find it if you go that way Ok thank you! Thank you. That way. See?

What do you want to do? Actually mom, I’m near her house. What? And actually I am in front of her house. You're already there. Why are you telling me like that... Sorry mom. What are you doing here? Hello? Hi. Why did you close my door? Because you're not dressed, you might get upset. Thank you. Are you okay? Did you catch a cold? I've been feeling a little bit sick but, I'm okay. You got wet in the rain last Tuesday. You should have showered when you got home. Yeah, I... I didn't. What did you do? I actually don't know. I don’t remember anything. Oh. Should I have remembered something? No, no. It's okay. Do you want to come inside? I can fix myself quickly. Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll just go upstairs and fix myself. I missed that look of yours. I fixed my socks. They're the same. What's this for? Are you asking me out? No. Okay. So... What is this actually, what are you doing here? Are you... trying to casually date me? Like, what is this? No, actually... We've been dating for six years, Lisa. What? Hold on. How did you do that? That's not me. Hold... hold on. Is this a joke? Where did you get those? That's not me. I've never met you before! Hold on! No... No... No... Who is this? That's not me! I've never met you before! This is a sick joke! You're a sick, sick pervert! That's not me! Who is this? What are you doing? Get out of my house! I don't know who you are! Stop it! Go, go! It's me, Lisa. If I could choose to live my life... There'd be no ifs to say. If I would choose to hold your hand... There'd be no words to say. So who do you want me to dedicate the book to? To Mary. I don't know who you are... Please just leave. Please just leave! I don't know you. My mom's coming home... I don't know you. Turn that off. Stop it. I don't know you. That's enough. Please, go home. It's me, Lisa! My mom, she's coming home...

You know where your mom is. Your mom is working. I know. She's always working. She is working for you. The same way I'm working for my baby girl, Lisa! Lisa? Can I see her again? Here.

How many was that? Five. Right! Five months! Just five more months and we'll see each other again! Oh! Oh! Out! Say hello! Hello! - Hi! - Hello. Let's go! Let's go! Lisa, you should go to sleep. We have an early flight to Manila tomorrow. Okay. Mary wanted me to give you this. My dear Pio, I don't have the heart to tell you this in person. I've decided to live in Korea for good. I'm a bad mother. No you're not. If you're a bad mother, then my mother is bad, too. You're not a bad mother, you're a bad wife. - How are you? - Good... what about you? Great! I got a date this weekend. She's from a lower batch but super cute! - Welcome back. - Thank you. Gun Hoo Kim... You're a foreigner and you read Filipino authors? Yeah, I once had a Filipino classmate for a while. Has anyone heard or does anyone know about this person? Ok, you. He was born in 1959 so he is around age of 63 at the moment. That’s correct. Give him a round of applause. Lunch after? Can we go out? I thought you were gonna... kiss me back or say something else. The air here is too heavy, too... recycled for this moment. I feel like we're in the bus. Much better. She's gonna get so mad when she sees my report card. How can I fail again? She's gonna send me home for sure. No! - Yes. - I'll ask her to make you stay longer. I promise I'll beg her! You love me too much. Remember my dad told you: love yourself more! Yeah, but... I love you more than I love myself, and I love you more than anyone else in the world! No! I'm not going to be here on your actual birthday. But you have to call me on Wednesday at midnight. Okay. Manila time and Korean time. Promise! What is this? Birthday gift. God, you're taking forever. I'll do it! I'll do it! So slow! Ta-da! Why do you always bring this scarf? Is this your favorite scarf? You like it? Thank you. I will miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Don't worry! I'm gonna fly back to Manila, and then I'm gonna get a good job, save so much money, and then I'll visit you. But I will go to Manila on Christmas. Really? Yeah. Promise! Promise! Cross your heart? Okay! I'm going to wait, alright! How many days? Four months! I love you! Mom? Lisa? If I could choose to live my life, there would be no ifs, because... Mom? What was that, sorry? Are you alright? If I would choose to hold your hand, there would be no words to say. Mom? What’s wrong auntie! Auntie. What’s wrong auntie? What’s wrong? Why? Open your eyes auntie. Open your eyes. Hold on... hold on. There is a person is dying here... Hold on. Here is... here is... here is... Donggyoro 110... Come quickly, please. Wake up auntie. What’s wrong auntie? Open your eyes auntie. Please open your eyes... It’s ok auntie. Is she ok? Can you do anything? Please drive faster. It’s ok. CJ, let me borrow your expense report from last month. Lisa! Your dad's on the phone. He said he's been calling you but you weren't picking up! Oh! Dad? What? Lisa! Lisa! - Lisa! Lisa! - Help! Lisa! Rest well now, Ate. Thank you for taking care of my son. It's gonna be okay. Let’s go home now. I just quit my job. Let’s go home now. I'm so sorry. MEMORY OF LOVE Sir, our first diagnosis was correct. Lisa has complex PTSD. It's rare for an abrupt event like her mother's suicide, but maybe she's harboring negative feelings or trauma from your relationship with your late wife. When will she remember everything? Sir, every case is different. Some patients recover in weeks, others in years. But with Lisa's case, her memory loss is quite severe. We did tests and we mentioned the dates that you said she spent with her mother, but she regresses even more. So in the meantime, I think it will be better, if we avoid anything that will remind her of Mary. Relationships and details surrounding that death should be withheld from her for now. I still can't remember anything. And my head hurts all the time. Which is why you should eat and take your medicine. Why isn't anyone visiting, don't I have any friends? No boyfriend? No husband? Didn't you say I was 23? Why am I always alone? You had a best friend once. He even became your boyfriend. Why isn't he visiting me? He left. You can leave, too. I don't need you here. Sorry the patient has left early in the morning. You know when my wife went to Korea, I knew she just wanted to help with the expenses when I lost my job. But when I got my job back, she still refused to come home. I knew there was a problem. I used to hate you. Yes. That, I know. You took the love that Lisa was supposed to have while growing up. But when I got to know you, and from Lisa's stories, and the fact that my wife loved Korea so much that she was happier there... It was all about you. It breaks my heart. But you can't see her anymore. Why? She can't remember Mary, she can't remember you. She will remember me. We have to wait until she says she remembers everything. In the meantime, we can't do anything. I'm sorry. I can wait. I'll wait. To Mary, sitting on a strawberry swing Why did you leave the hospital? What more do you want from me? I lost both of you. I know. But I was already okay. Why did you have to come back? I couldn’t just let you go. Your dad said I could return when you gave me a sign. That book was my sign! In that book every chapter, was our memory, our time. The thing that your mom taught us, the thing that your dad taught us were all written there. No, I can't do this I don't know you. Why are you here in Korea? Why did you say yes to flying here with a stranger? Because, deep down you know who I am. You trust who I am! You're the best person I've ever met. Probably the best I will ever meet. But I'm not the same anymore. I'm just not the same person anymore, I've lost so many years of my life. I will remind you everyday... I will... When you came back here again, I couldn't believe it. It was so hard. So hard not to reach out and hug you. It was so hard to walk away! But I wanted you to remember on your own. And I could see that in your eyes. Why? Why? Why can’t you do it? Just stop. Just go home. It's time to stop. This place was my mom's room 19. This was her room 19 when she wanted to get away from all of us. From me, from my dad, from you... I was always your room 19. I need my own space, I need my own room 19 in this world. For so many years, I believed your safe place was me. But I guess I was wrong. Even if you come here everyday, and all the places you went to you won’t find him. You told him to go away! Stupid girl. Uncle! You called me stupid again! One more free fish cake! Oh gosh! That’s the last one. Why are you making rules in my shop? You are now local. You should help Korean economy. Later, later. Promise. Promise? Promise! - Okay! - Okay. Thank you! I’m so excited. It’s so pretty. I like this green and red color. Its so pretty. Hello! I got the address through the e-mail. Thank you for meeting us personally. No problem. I hope you enjoy your stay. This house has a lot of memories. Ah, yes! Thank you! Bye! Hey, you ok? Never better. Ok I have a date tonight with a super pretty girl and her dad is a doctor. She’s bringing her friend too and her friend is pretty too. Wanna join? - Okay. - Okay. Hey. I’m gonna throw this out, ok?
