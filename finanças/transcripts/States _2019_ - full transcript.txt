Sir, perdón, señor. Uh, no... no, I una uh, passport. Uh, es... um, es... uh, está bien uh, porton uh... Wait, wait. What the fuck is that? What do you... what do you mean? Uh, I'm... I'm in a little bit of a predicament right now. I... I don't have my passport. I need to get back over the border into Texas. You said you have a car, right? I do, I have it in the parking right down the street. Really need to get back there. You have enough money to pay for that? 'Cause, dude, I don't wanna get in trouble. Well, you know, I... I would definitely pay you, certainly, but the thing is that I... I don't have any money on me either as well as having no passport. So the problem is uh, I would need to get the money from my friend in a town maybe 40, 50 miles outside of Dallas. Hmm. - Hello. - Hi. Uh, do you have any alien records? Uh, illegal alien? No. No, like extra-terrestrial uh, aliens like making music. No, I sure don't. No. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? No, go ahead. How long have you been here? - About 12 years. - Oh yeah? Have you ever been to Marfa? Sure. Ha... have you seen the lights? - Yes, I have. - Oh, man. What do you think about them? Uh, I think it's either swamp gas or uh, mineral deposit reflections. Oh, interesting. So you don't think they're extra-terrestrial? - No, no. - No. - Do you believe in aliens? - Sure, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Do you have any like special theories why they're here? Uh, they're probably just exploring like we are... - Yeah. - In space, right? Would you go with them if they asked? Uh, it depends on for how long. Yeah. Yeah, like uh, are you thinking like a month-long journey? Or just like you know, a couple days in space is okay? Yeah, like a weekend getaway. - Oh, weekend getaway, okay. - Right. - That's cool. - Um... You know, you can only take so much probing. Oh yeah, that's true. That's cool. Um, if you were looking for aliens where would you go? - Oh, probably Roswell. - Oh yeah? It seems to be the last place that they saw 'em. I'm planning on going there next. That's what I think, too. - Hi, there. - Jesus, took you long enough! Plus you fuck around on the side streets for like five minutes. Sorry, um, yeah, where are we headed? Does the AC work? Can you turn the AC on please? - Oh yeah, yeah, sorry. - Thank you. Give me one second. Uh, so you work at Crazy Girls? Get a life. You think I work at Crazy Girls? Oh, s... Sorry, I'm an idiot. I just thought, 'cause I was picking you up there... 'Cause you picked me up there that I must work there something? Correlation implies causation? Yeah, I'm an idiot, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything. Alright. Hmm, you keep a lot of stuff on your floor. What... wh... wh... what do you do? Well, if you must know I'm an actor. I was at Crazy Girls - researching a role. - Oh. And then this morning I just went - to drop something off. - Cool. Um, what... wh... What was the role? A stripper. Oh, I'm s... Um, yeah, I mean I guess that makes sense like... Yeah, I guess that does make sense. I... I was just curious, 'cause... What's your name? - Frank. - Frank. You ever been to a strip club before, Frank? Uh, no, I... I... I don't really... Oh, bullshit. - I call bullshit on this. - I just... Never stepped foot inside a strip club? No, I'm not really... Oh my God, I am so not buying that line of like male pseudo feminist. "Oh, I've never been to a strip club in my life." I would never go to a strip club. "It's so demeaning." I'm sorry I feel like we got off on the wrong foot and I just... Uh, I didn't mean to like insult you or anything like that. I feel like I'm going around in circles. Now, you're gonna take the 101 to the 170. - You know where that is? - Yeah. You just see... you'll... you'll see signs for it, just keep going straight. Where are we going again? Just get on the highway please. Just the 10... just take the 101 to the 170. - Do you know where the 170 is? - W... what... what? - You know what the 170 is? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so just take the 101 to the 170. - What's the... - And we'll go from there. Destination though? Just a second. Just give me one second. Are you looking at the directions or... Yes, Frank. Oh yeah, all of my best friends. So just keep getting over, 'cause we're gonna pass that if... Ventura or like... Yeah, Ventura... either. - Both of them. - I know. Uh, so we're kind of far... Far out in the freeway now. Uh, do you um, do you happen to know where we're... - Oh my God. - Going? Look at this fucking basic ass bitch. Look at her. What a stupid... Would you fuck this girl? Do you think that shit is sexy? Is that like cheesy bullshit like, "Oh my God!"? - Uh, are you just on Instagram? - "Oh God." - I thought you were... - This fucking bitch... Okay, so I see her at an audition, and we start following each other on Instagram, and then she is going through my pictures, and finds the one... the only like somewhat sexy photo I have on Instagram and says that I have fucking daddy issues, which is... And then now I'm looking at her Instagram and there is literally a video of her fellating a fucking pickle and she's gonna tell me that I have daddy issues. Look at her, look, look at this, look at this. Uh, we're eating a fucking ice cream sundae with a little like, "Ooh, oh my God." What is that? What goes in here? "What goes in this mouth?" Uh, okay, but that's not gonna... Uh, you're not getting us any closer to an address or... - "Will you..." - Uh... "Will you be my daddy? Can you tell me where penises go?" - Where we're going? - "I don't know." Hey, Buck Lee, need a ride? Oh, yeah. Come... come on, hop in. Oh God, thank you. That's okay. Hey. Where you coming from, pilgrim? Uh, San Francisco, basically, yeah. Look at him, Mak. Oh, he's cute. What's your name? - Simon. - Simon. Simon. Simon, I'm Jaz. - Oh, I'm Makenzie. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Jaz and Makenzie. You're something. No, he's precious. Thank you. How old are you? Uh, 27. That's sweet, 27. That's a cute age. How... how old are you? - Yeah, same. - Same? - Mmhmm. - Cool. How long you've been doing this? It's like three months basically. Let your hair grow out like that I can tell. - I'm... I'm writing a book a... - Okay. Yeah, it's poetry. - It's a book of poetry. - Oh, wow, poetry! So you're an artiste, huh? Well, I mean, yeah. - Can I read it? - Well, when it's... - Well, let us read it. - When it's done. - Oh. - When it's done, yeah. - Totally. - Okay. Yeah, I'll... I'll sign a copy and I'll send it right on to you. So where... where did you say you're from? Um, I'm from San Francisco. - Oh. - Yeah. That's sort of a funny... People are kind of funny there. Yeah. I mean, yeah, a lot... I mean, it's great. I mean I didn't... I didn't grow up there. I'm not like uh... uh, like uh, someone from the bay, but I... - Are you gay? - Uh, yeah. I mean I'm... I... I identify as queer but, yeah. Yeah, are you? No, no. No, I like cock. Fine. I love your hair, I always wish I had curly hair. Thank you. Um, so wait. What... Why are you going to Salt Lake? There is like this big reading that happens. This um, it's like this major event... Like this huge conference of writers, so I hitchhiked from... From San Francisco to Salt Lake. And I'm gonna spend the next two weeks there getting ready for this weird thing that could lead to a lot of like... Like you know, basically like every major agents there you know, like you know, the Graywolf, fucking Rivershead, like they're all gonna be watching um, the people who are reading. So um, this could be a really big platform for me and my... yeah, like I don't know. Well, maybe you can put something about me in it. Yeah, yeah, maybe. Maybe. I mean I've been writing about every... everything - I've been encountering, so... - Okay. Yeah, it wouldn't be that surprising if you two ended up in it. Alright, welcome to Texas. Get out the trunk. Get out. 205, right? Your homie's house. Yeah. Go get my money now. Uh, alright, well, uh, just give me... Give me one second, alright? I got... I just got to... I ta... I got to talk to my friend, okay? No problem, go get it. Alright. Alright. Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait! Where are you going? Stop, stop! Stop, wait, stop! How'd you even try to fucking run away from me, man? Hello, man. Hey. Hey, buddy, you got any money? Maybe you got any cigarettes. Oh yeah, welcome, bud. If you've seen a couple of bucks, get up here. You'd be okay out here? You sure you ain't got a cigarette? No, I... I... I don't smoke, man. Actually, uh... - Yeah? - So... You sure you don't any money? Hey, hey, ta... taxi. Can you just... Uh, can you drive me somewhere? Like uh, anywhere please uh, just uh, drive. Where you wanna go? Uh, just... just uh... uh, anywhere please. I just need to... Uh, I need get out of here. Okay. Where you from? Uh, I... I grew up in Detroit actually. Everything is bigger in Texas. So where did you come from? This Eritrea, that small country northeast Africa. - Eritrea? - Yes, sir. - By uh, Ethiopia? - Yes. Close. Okay. And what brought you here? That's a long story. Are you familiar with this area? - This is Dealey Plaza. - Yeah. - This is Dealey Plaza here? - Yeah. So like uh, you know, this is where you know, - Zapruder filmed uh, Kennedy. - Yes. Is there anywhere we could stop for a minute? I... I've uh, I've... I've always you know... You know, seen this since I... I was a kid. - I... I'd really love to uh... - Sure. Get out for a moment, if you don't mind. Sure. I... I can't believe that uh, that I'm looking at this right now. Well, that's history, sad history, but... - Yeah. - It is history. Yeah, you know I've seen the... I've seen the videos - and everything, but uh... - Look like a... He was... he was coming... Coming down here? Yeah, coming down here. I... I believe it was under that fence. Going this way? Yes. So... That's the depository. That's the depository there. And obviously where we're sitting now is the... - The knoll. - Yes. And then so behind me over here is the... is the fence. Is the fence, yeah. I can't believe that I'm here right now. It's um... you know, you... You build this picture in your uh, in your head uh, you know, of a place in history. You know, it doesn't seem someone... To actually be there, it doesn't seem uh, it doesn't seem real you know, it seems like a dream. He really was a nice man. Hey, where are you going? Uh, Roswell. I can... I can take you towards it. A good way. Ursa, hey. Oh, thank you. Thank you for stopping. Uh, you can come up front if you want. - Oh no, I'm fine back here. - Alright. Thank you. - Well, this is Ursa. - Oh. - And I'm Joe. - I'm Rachel. - Yeah, nice to meet you. - Thank you for stopping. No problem. It's hot outside. You heading to Albuquerque or something or is Roswell the destination? Um, Roswell is the destination for now I guess. I'll see, gonna find when we get there. When I get there. You got any family there? No. Never been there. So what's with the tape recorder? Are you a journalist? No, this is just for personal use. What are you looking to learn? Where to go and what to do, but something tells me that when I get there I'll just know. Know what? I don't know, I'll just know it. Then why are you going? Okay, you're gonna think I'm crazy, you're gonna think you picked up a crazy person, but um, I... I've been hearing like music in my head, and dreams, and I just think Roswell is where those are leading me to. Looking for an epiphany? So you're gonna go over to Debris Field to see what's left of it? Uh, no. Isn't that usually where all the alien nuts go? Isn't that where they crashed? Are you calling me "an alien nut"? You hear music. I am an alien communicator. What are y'all saying? I mostly just listen, dance sometimes. Um, it makes me feel more connected. Do the aliens have electro dance music? Um, it's kind of like... I think that one's taken. Well, I'm not doing it justice. It's hot cross buns. Well, it doesn't actually sound like that. So what do you think it means? I don't know. It's just when I hear it, it makes me feel... Makes you feel free. Feel like I can go anywhere and do anything. It's beautiful that hot cross buns make you feel that great. Is that better? It's sure way more comfortable up here. Yes, thank you. We friends yet? We've made contact, we're friends now. That's good. Well, there is certain phenomena that they can't explain, 'cause we don't have the technology, we don't have the machinery. You know, those Marfa lights. Uh, people see ghosts. Uh, people go into different dimensions, people have out-of-body experiences. I've had one and I hurt myself. I've had um, I've had some sensations, too. Um, and some... some... I don't know what you call it. Um, metaphysical or paranormal experiences, but um, I know they're real. I just know that we call them "paranormal", because we don't fully understand them. Like you're gonna have to ask yourself is what would it take to know for sure. Mmhmm. It wouldn't just take somebody telling you. Not only are we not alone in the universe, but we're not alone on this planet. - Half price? - Yeah. How much is the tour? Alright. Let me think about it. There you would see the Hollywood sign and take pictures. You drive this? Nice. This is the same kind of girl who like complains about people sexualizing her on the internet. Like, "Oh my God, I know I posted pictures" of my twat everywhere, but it's not about sexuality. I mean it is, but not like what you think it is, only what I think it is. "Only I'm allowed to sexualize myself." Actresses like her are exactly the reason why there are no interesting parts for women, why they're all just sex-toy victims whose only purpose in the story is to cater to the male character's fucking journey or whatever. We always get the same like victimy goal where it's no matter what you are you are also a sex object. Yeah, I kinda know what you mean. And you're both of those things. You don't know what I mean, you're a guy. What? Do you know what I'm talking about? I mean, yeah... Rampant sexism that makes most entertainment just completely boring and unwatchable. Yeah, I... I totally agree with you. - I mean I... - Really? I write... I write screen... Screenplays and I try to write female roles that are like actually well-rounded and interesting. You shitting me? - I mean, yeah. - You are shitting me? Yeah, no, yeah, I... I do that. Like I don't care about what is in your plot. A story with female characters just like plot devices, that is interesting. I mean I agree it's not as interesting. I get... I guess I'm just saying I get what you're saying. Yeah, I'm... I'm... You're not one of those guys who's trying to convince me he's not one of those guys, are you? No, no, I actually... I actually do this. Like I... I try to write something with real female roles and... The problem is like that's not... You know. Good for you. No, rea... I mean sincerely we need more writers like that in the arena of writing. So much mediocrity muddying the waters. Okay, I... I... I'm glad we're having like a real conversation, but like I actually need to know um, where you're going. Like where I'm... Where I'm supposed to be taking you? So I am going to Vegas, that's where I'm on my way to. Uh, but you do not have to drive me all the way to Vegas. You've been very generous with your time and your car. So as close as you feel comfortable driving me would be really great. I can just get off at a... - You want me to just drop you... - Yeah. At the side of the road somewhere? Well, not that. I mean you know, a gas station or something. You know, I could probably find someone to hitch a ride with from there I guess. Between you and me, I can't really afford an Uber all the way to Las Vegas anyway, so... I mean if you were driving to Vegas, I would love to drive with you just 'cause uh, you know, you seem like a very normal person and honestly, I've been enjoying our conversation very much. So that would be... But again, no pressure. I'm happy to get out and find a ride from wherever you drop me off. It's really not a problem. What are you thinking about? I don't know. A lot of... a lot of stuff. I don't know. I just... like everything and nothing. Oh my God, you got a writer's mind. Funny. I'm gonna go sit back, I'm gonna sit with Simon. Oh my God, you're gonna sit with Simon. Excuse me. Me and you. Are you looking out the window or you're looking at me? I'm looking at you. - You hear that, Kenz? - Yeah, yeah. Oh my God. Simon, tell me more about your adventure. There... there's like very few opportunities for poets. Like being a poet it's like... It's like... like the... Like the worst uh, creative endeavor one could decide - to partake in. - Uh-huh. Like I've done like every sort of like coffee shop you can do in the bay. You know, I've like... I've been on almost every fucking website for emerging poets you know, and this is my first... Like my only opportunity to shape my life and push my career into sort of lit... Into sort of literary wor... Wor... oh God! The literary r... realm. I can't speak. The literary realm that I'm trying to break into you know, it's like it's a place where I'll be taken seriously and where like I can move into a different direction as a poet you know, because like it doesn't matter if people in like San Francisco care about the things I write, you know? Like if... if like... if people aren't gonna remember me like what was the point? None of that matters unless you're... You're pleasing the Father first? You consider yourself a spiritual man? I... I... like I consider myself more like a philosophical man. Okay. What do you think happens when you die? Um... I can't really say what happens, you know? Um, I... 'cause I haven't died. But yeah. Yeah, that's how I feel. You know? But like I love... I love spiritual... Are you guys spiritual or... - Yeah. - Feebly spiritual. - Yeah. - Oh, that's amazing. - That's so cool, yeah. - It's like a v... It's like an energy vortex out here and like I'm surprised you can't feel it. Wow! No, like I mean I... like being with you guys - will help me feel that I hope. - Yeah, yeah. You know, like that's what I need right now. We're taking you to Zion. - Zion. - Yeah. The beautiful city of God. Okay, okay. - It's... it's like a mecca. - Oh nice! That's really... okay, cool, yeah. Just sightseeing. - Okay. - Yeah. Taking in the sights. Yeah, oh, that's... That's totally... That's totally fine. Yeah, I uh... this whole thing, it's sort of like... It's... yeah, it's like that's what it's about, you know? She's been touched. She's been t... touched. Thank you. Thank you. Oh my God, that's... Oh my God, that was... thank you. Thank you. That's... I mean... Hmm. That fact that like... this is what it's all about you know, like... like in this crazy fucking country, like there is so many different ways to like express you know, your love of like yourselves, and the world, and like your gods, and like the fact that there are so many different ways - to express your faith... - Yeah. Like that's... dude, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Okay. Obviously, a good one. You know, just uh... Just 'cause you're not... If you wanna come to heaven with us, you can. Um, if you want to. Alright. You don't... You don't have to go. You don't have to go now. Hey, man. You alright? Hey, you alright? Um, well, I've been better, to be honest. Can I help you with something? You... you're passed out in the middle of a parking lot. Uh, do you need a ride somewhere? I'm trying to uh... Trying to get to a town called "Alpine" in Texas. Uh, I'm not going that far west, but I'm going to West Texas to... to linger, but you um... I could use a companion if you'd like to go along? Okay. Uh, thank you, you know so much for uh, for helping me out here. Giving me a ride, waking me up and everything. Dude, I'm glad to help out. It's kind of what I do. So now why are you heading to Alpine? Just... Uh, well, I... I guess you can say I'm... I'm looking for a friend. Or I mean somebody I thought who was a friend. You have to drive like long distances like this pretty often? Uh, no, this is just you know, just the enjoyment of being free and you know, having some vacation time. Okay, so uh, just kind of rambling, huh? Yeah, I don't know exactly. I know the direction I'm heading, but I'm not really sure you know, how I'm getting into or what I'm gonna be... Kind of leaving it a little bit open for magic. See where the uh... See where the world kind of takes you? Yeah. You've got the right idea you know, waking up in parking lots you know, it just... You know, not... Not knowing exactly where you are. I think you're... You're living a good life. You're a role model. I mean what would you rather be like? Like sitting behind a desk, answering emails or being passed out on a... On a grocery store parking lot? Driving with a friend, a new friend. It's been happening a little too uh, a little too often for my taste lately, to be honest. It sounds like you're living a good life. - I mean... - I don't know. I don't know if I'd say good. I'm... I'm living a life. Oh, it sounds like you're here on a hero sort of thing. You know, I guess you got a point there, it's a little bit of uh- See that says, "slow down". I think we oughta speed up. You're behind the wheel, man. Always. Have you ever heard that song " Jesus, Take the Wheel "? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah, Carrie Underwood. Uh, what's with the uh, Jesus Cross there that you got? It's just for my back. It helps me kinda straighten out. I have... I have some back problems, lower back. I injured my back. So you carry that Cross with you wherever you go? Yeah. Just... I keep it in my trunk. Alright. It just reminds me you know, of my... So uh, sorry, where... We're heading uh, towards where now? San Antonio. - You... you know Saint Anthony? - Yeah, yeah. It's a spiritual place, it's like absolutely incredible. You've never been there? Oh, no, I've never been there. Do you... I mean I'm not in a huge hurry. What do you think? You wanna just like... Have you ever seen the Alamo or... - No. - Or... No, the Alamo. Remember the Alamo, no, I haven't uh... Yeah. Hopefully, we'll get lost a bit. It's odd uh, you know, I've passed through uh, Texas so many times, I've never... Never been down here before. I can't uh... don't know why. Well, I mean I think we have pretty busy lives, we're always trying to get from one destination to the other. Excuse us. Um, yeah, so we don't often take time to just linger. So tell me again about this person you're trying to find. All I know about this guy is that he works at a record store in a place called Alpine, Texas. He could be lying though. Is he a friend of yours or a relative or... - Well... - What's up with that? I uh, I don't really know, to be honest. I... I kind of thought he was a friend. I... I don't really know if I can trust anything about who he is or what this guy is now? Hmm. Kind of you know, played me, took all my shit, and just left me out in the middle of nowhere. I got to find this fucker somehow, you know? Wow. Uh, it sounds kind of angry. Are you... this is... huh? It makes me really mad, - I could have... - Right. You know, I could have died in that you know... You know I need to I... Yeah, I'm sorry that happened to you. - So I n... - Like kind of. I don't have a lot to lose anymore. I've got you know clothes on my body. - Oh, congratulations again. - Well. All these revelations. So uh, you know, I guess uh, I guess have enough having nothing to lose like that. Uh, I've got the uh, got the freedom to uh, to give an ass-kicking and risk the consequences. What would you do you? You... what do you think I should just like let it go? Forgive this guy? That's a great start or maybe a great end. I can't say I'm gonna consider that. I don't know if that's gonna work for me. So all this talk about like forgiveness and things like that, I got to ask, are you like a religious guy, like am I sensing something there? I'm religious about watching college basketball or... I'm religious about drinking. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Say what you will about you know, what you know, miracles and uh... you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. There are many historians that you know, believe that maybe that uh, you know, these saints were you know, there's some historical basis to them existing you know, maybe the miracles aren't a thing. Hmm. But you know, these were just you know, actual people just kind of uh, out there being you know, saintly I guess or whatever. So you know, who's to say that you're not a saint or that you know, there aren't saints walking around uh, among us, you know? In ancient times, you... You know, people believed in you know, supernatural miracles and things like that and you know, ma... Okay, look over here for a second. Not that your story's not important, but isn't that cool? A giraffe with sunglasses. And a mad woman. - An angry woman. - Yeah. Huh, I wonder I would've seen that. Perhaps, you're a saint. Um, yeah, I... I guess I don't really know if I'm ready to be a saint right now, to be honest, but... Oh look, a duck. We have light waves, don't we, particles that come to Earth? - Yeah. - Why not sound? Sound is a particle also and it comes like light. So what... what we're hearing is probably voices of creatures to communicate with us to decode. Fuck me. Hey, will you take my picture? Uh, yeah, sure, I guess. I wanna give it to my kid. Alright. Is this good? Yeah, that's great. - Yeah. - Great. Thank you. No problem. It's just so goddamn beautiful. I travel a lot and I'm really starting to hate my fucking job. At least I know I can come here and take a look at this. I don't mean to talk your ear off. It's like I had a shitty childhood, abusive dad. I got some positive things from my mom though. I learned how to fight, 'cause she'd beat the shit out of me, too. You were gonna laugh at that, weren't you? I take comfort in knowing that Mother Nature doesn't give a shit. We're like this big in the big scheme of things. Life is indifferent to us. All my life, people always think I should do what I'm good at. We cover Hollywood, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Rodeo Drive... But I'm really getting sick of it. The tour is for two hours. Because it's not what I really like to do. I've got a deal right now, I give you a $20 deal. We are a legitimate touring company, you got to be careful of that. Hollywood tours. Who wants a Hollywood tour? Hollywood tour? You want a Hollywood tour? Hollywood tours? Hey, you want a Hollywood tour? I do want to do a Hollywood tour. What do you do? I got the whole rundown movie stars, classic era to present day. What do you want? Movie stars? How much do you charge? Dude, you don't look like you do tours. You don't look... like you don't have anything on you. I got it all up here. I know everything about all the movie stars for the silent era, classic era, present day, whatever you want. You want movie stars? But you look like you may be dark side... Dark side of Hollywood? Murders? - I like dark side. - Yeah. - What do you charge? - 30 bucks. How about we do it for 20? Make it 25. No, how about we do it for 20 and I'll drive. - Okay, great, let's do it. - Alright. Now, imagine early 20th century, alright? You have uh, Eastern European Jews escaping from the pogroms, escaping from repression in Europe. They come to the United States, they're in New York, they get involved in showbiz, they get involved in movie industry, but at the time Edison owns all the cameras, Edison owns all the patents, they have to escape that. So they go out to California. It's an entirely new world. No one's out here at this point. It's cheap. Cheap land, cheap labour, and they envision this entirely new thing, Hollywood, right? They have all this land, build these studios, now they can create anything, big musicals. So here we are. Well, this is Grauman's Egyptian Theatre. This is one of the first big grand theaters they built. This is where they're gonna have their big movie premieres. So they roll out the red carpet. You know, this is where the red carpet comes from, right? They roll out the red carpet, they had the movie stars walking on the red carpet, and then there's fans, fans coming from all over the states, from all the country, from all over the world. They come here to see their... Their idols, you know? This is the idolatry, this is hero worship at its... At its... at its finest, right? So you have people you know, people on either side of the red carpet. You have people over here on this side of the carpet, "Oh, oh, Douglas!" Douglas Fairbanks, right? And then people over here, "Oh, oh, oh!" Mary Pickford, right? You know, you wanna touch your idol, but you wanna become that idol, you wanna live forever just like them up on the silver screen, up on the silver screen in the Egyptian Theatre, which is the i... This idea of ancient... What can live forever? Movies can live forever. That's what they're implying here, right? Hollywood is here. This is Hollywood. This is Hollywood at the pinnacle where dream factories are being built everywhere, this is the biggest thing, this is where everyone's coming in. They're busting them in, okay? By the thousands, everyone, wannabes, nobodies, nobodies wanna be wannabes, wannabes wanna be somebody, somebodies are nobodies, nobodies are somebodies, wannabes everywhere as far as the eye can see crowding the red carpet. Across the way there that's the Roosevelt Hotel. That's the original location they had for Academy Awards, the Oscars, right? The first ceremony ever. Imagine... okay, we're back now, we're in the late 1920s, okay? So Hollywood's established, right? It's making these big glamorous movies, exporting them all over the country, all over the world, everyone's celebrating, right? But what does Hollywood wanna do now? They wanna celebrate themselves, right? So they get together in a big circle jerk party at the Roosevelt Hotel, they all hand each other gold statues, right? So they're gonna glamorize themselves even further. They're gonna show themselves to be the best at everything, right? And does it work? Did it ever? Look at this. We're gonna need a bigger boat, right? Yeah, here we are. This is where they have the Oscars now. The Dolby Theatre. Enough of this classic Hollywood bullshit. You promised me you're gonna show me some dark sides of this town. Okay, okay, we're gonna get to it. We're gonna go to the really fucked up places, okay? Just keep going straight. There is some really fucked-up shit in Hollywood I'm telling you. Uh, it's really dark and you know, I'm seeing it up, and close, and personal now. I'm trying to... trying to get in to the industry. I'm writing screenplays it's... you can't... You can't do anything. It's all about who you know. It's important. It's fucked up. I'm writing something really great. It's gonna change the whole world once it finally gets made, but right now it just gets lost in the sea of mediocrity, 'cause there's so many... You just feel... you feel like you feel the desperation, you feel the anguish and just everyone trying to be discovered. So what's your screenplay about? Uh, it's about time travel. Seems... that seems like a little weird to just drop you at a random place. It's totally fine. Why are you going to Las Vegas anyway? Uh, to research that part. I don't know I just had to get out of Los Angeles, you know? I... I started to feel so stifled there. Everything exists in this weird LA world that is not really a reflection of real... I mean do... you must know what I'm talking about. Do you ever feel that way? Do you just wanna... Just break through the force field, go see something else or be somewhere else or be someone else? You know what I'm talking about? So I was thinking, we should just... Let's just go, let's go to Vegas. - Uh, are you... - Are you serious? Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. - You're gonna get there. - Oh my God! Thank you! That was the best thing! This is gonna be so much fun. Oh my God! You are the best. - Hey. - Here you go. Oh, thank you so much. You're so sweet. I do not know why my card is not working, that's so weird. I like just put money in my account. So you really don't believe in anything? Well... Yeah, I mean I think it depends on what your parameters for belief are. You know, like I believe in art and like expression. You know, for me that is like my version of spirituality in like the greatest sense, like the idea that... That like my singular voice can like change someone's perspective or their politics on like a purely like individual level. Man, can I get a cig off you? It's my last one. Oh, appreciate it. Thank you. Can I get a light, too? What? I'm sorry. You want me to smoke the cigarette for you, too? No, that's cool, man. Aren't you one of those ghost hunter people? - Ghost? - No. What the fuck is a ghost hunter? I thought you was a ghost hunter. You're sitting in a really ghostly spot. You don't know? This is a hell of a place for a nigger to be smoking a cigarette. Why? - You see that house, brother? - Uh-huh. Back in the day, shit used to go down. There was this old rich white bitch, right? And she had a real distaste for niggas. Mmhmm. And not like the usual white person back in the days, like she really hated niggas. She would host parties on the second floor and chop dicks off on the third. She had a dick chopping room. Didn't stop at chuck... Chopping dicks left and right, you know? Chopping dicks left and right right here? Yeah, and that was the lucky ones. The worst ones used to get slashed open all in the guts, they'd take out the gall bladder for no reason. Anything she could take out, she would take it out and just see how long they last without it. You know what I mean? You would think somebody would notice all those dicks everywhere you know just... You know, when the trash bank comes and he's got a whole bunch of black dicks in his trash get a whole bunch of black dicks in the trash and you think maybe she gave up pretty soon. Brother, she wanted a long fucking tower. You know, what got her caught? What? A beautiful 12-year-old baby girl. She was trying to torture this girl, but this girl had a you know, she had a will to live, right? So she made it out, she jumped the banister, hit the floor in the middle of the street. You can't pass that shit. And that almost got her caught, almost. Everywhere there were some questions. The fire people are like, "Why you got little slave girls jumping off your banister?" She's like "Uh, you know, how niggas be." That's what she said, right? She said, "You know, how the niggas be"? Uh, I think that's what she said. "You know how those niggas be just jumping off banisters." You know, the white slut was saying. "You know how niggas be jumping off banisters." And the cop was like, "Yeah, we know how the niggas be jumping off banisters." And they let that bitch go. You believe that shit? So I shouldn't be smoking cigarette right here, just that's what you're saying. Yeah. A little 12-year-old girl might actually fall out. You know, fuck up your night up. Yeah. But fuck that. If you wanna go to a real place, it's called "the Lafitte's Blacksmith", you know. And blacksmiths is nice honest people, you know? They had... you know? They gave niggas horseshoes when they needed 'em. - Let's go. - Let's do it. I mean that's... that to me... - I don't know what is more... - Okay. To believe in than that. Okay, sorry to interrupt, but if you don't wanna look at God, look out... look at... Look out your window, man. What are you looking at out there? You don't think you're a part of that? Yeah, I mean no, I am, but it's like... It's different though in a way, you know? Simon, Simon, you are that mountain, and Makenzie... Makenzie's Zion. Don't you understand that? Hmm. No. But like I mean... I want to. Good, good. So this is gonna be the quintessential. West Texas town, ranching, if someone put it on the map, then I guess I would, I would. See Dolph Briscoe Jr., that was one of our governors. Oh, you... you... uh, you said that earlier like uh, famous uh, that's what this town is - famous for having the... - Yeah. Hometown boy that went on to become governor, huh? Right. You're not from Canada, are you originally? No, I grew up in uh, I grew up near Detroit. Mmhmm. I hope you didn't take offense to that. Oh my God, the Kincaid. That... that's a cool hotel. Church's fried chicken. I'm always drawn to things that are religious. Thank you for keeping me awake. I'm kinda tired. Yeah, I got to be honest, I'm like kind of um, all ready to pass out here. Wow, what's that? Twice the Ice. You've got to love penguins. Look at that Gringo, Johnny Gringos. I guess that's not offensive. So uh, what now? You know, my back still hurts. Um, I'm thinking this is where we maybe part ways. I go one way and you can kind of go the other. I uh, just wondered if you wanna just take a shot of whiskey together. Uh, so you... you're saying I can... can uh, crash with you here? No, I mean I just... yeah, I think your journey's that way and mine's that way. Alright, well, uh, yeah, whiskey it is. Let there be light. Thank you for everything. My pleasure. We will be so happy. This is great, I'll do everything. I'll do... I'll do the space mission. I'll be the best... I will be the best for you. You know what I wanna do? What? Guess. Uh, you want to be a motivational speaker. No. I wanna blog. I wanna blog about all the shitty bathrooms and shitty burger joints I see out there. I mean you could find God in the sky, you could find God in the canyon, but I'd be goddamned if you can't find God in a nice burger and a clean ass bathroom. So where are you going next? Hollywood. What's in Hollywood? Movie stars. Do you ever wish you could go back, talk to your younger self, maybe give some advice? Yeah, I do. Not me. I wouldn't change a fucking thing about my wretched life. Well, thanks for the picture. So you wanted the dark side of Hollywood, right? It doesn't get more fucked up than the Church of Scientology. A lot of people say the Manson murders were the end of the 1960s, because they destroyed people's um, faith in everything that was going on at the time. They came here to this house and they killed uh, the LaBianca family, but first they held 'em here hostage for two days. So we got hordes of people come into Hollywood. They all want to make it, they want to be movie stars, they wanna see themselves up on a silver screen. One of these people, Elizabeth Short, she comes in the mid-1940s um, and she's this wannabe who wants to be somebody, right? And you know they call her "Betty Short" for short uh, and she never really makes it, she's never a movie star, she's never really up on the silver screen, but she finds fame in a different way, in infamy, in death. She was murdered, cut in half, and her body, the two pieces of it, were found right over there on that grass. This was just a field at the time and the press had a field day when they found out about this, 'cause it's... It was so sensational. And so it's on every newspaper's front page, every Los Angeles tabloid has the uh, Black Dahlia murders, because her friends call her the "Black Dahlia". This brutal murder was another sort of case of "Oh, Hollywood isn't the uh, innocent place" that it seems when you see in the movies. It... it's actually there is a dark underbelly uh, and she represents that. She is this similar... And ehe murder was never solved either, so there is no resolution to it. It's just this void of... Of mystery and... and intrigue and... and romance. She found her immortality, but only by exposing her actual mortality. Let's take a moment of silence to remember Betty Short. We have a ton to get through, okay? - Um, do you have time? - Do I have time? - Yeah. - Not really. Okay, well, if we don't get to everything uh, you can give me a call, my address is on here as well. I'm very neighborly, come just knock on my door, whatever, we can do a part 2, we can do a part 3 if we run out of time. Um, yeah. Is this your business? That's what you do? Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah. I've know everything about Hollywood, I'm always thinking about this stuff. I wanna make movies, I'm a screenwriter, so yeah, I do this. Well, I also like drive Uber, Lyft, all that stuff, to make extra money on the side, but I'm trying to do this. This is my, like my gig, you know? I wanna make it in Hollywood. So can we go check out some actors' homes? Yeah, I know where they all live. Just name one. Freddy Parks. Freddy Parks. Oh yeah, like that child actor. Yeah, I know where he lives. Um, yeah, just keep going straight and then take a right at the next uh, chance you can. Yeah, fucking Freddy Parks. I haven't thought of that guy in a while. He's really fucked up now, right? He's all hooked on drugs, he's in and out of rehab, he owes people money, right? You see him do those commercials now, 'cause he's... he's uh, well, he got gambling problems and all kinds of stuff. God, that's the worst, right, the plight of a fucking child actor, huh? You know you think it's everything you want, right? You grow up, you're rich, famous, get anything you want, but it's... it's... it's a curse, right? Having... when you have everything you want, suddenly no one says "no" to you and you can have everything you know, it's like the devil's bargain. God, I don't envy them at all. One day you wake up and suddenly you're... You're fucking you know, you're a joke, you're an answer to a Trivial Pursuit question. You... you know, you're lucky if you don't end up fucking... Fucking de... dead body somewhere you know, one of those E! True Hollywood stories. - That him? - Oh holy shit! Yeah, that's Freddy Parks. There is Freddy Parks right there. There was Freddy Parks. Fuck! Jesus! I got your card in case I need to get a hold of you. Thank you very much for the tour. Jesus, fucking... Piece of shit. Jesus, fucking God! What the fuck am I doing? You said you're going to Las Vegas to research a part? Is that right? Uh, yeah. I am going to Las Vegas to research a role. That's... uh, I didn't get. What? Casting director said that I was not believable as a stripper. So even though I should probably take it as a compliment, I never want to not book a part like that again. So I'm gonna go to Vegas, gonna really research that life, what it really means to do that and... And next time I'll just knock it out of the water. I was just saying... oh, like I am trying to get... get something going in show business, but like you got to be careful, you know? Like earlier what you... You were trying to hitchhike or something earlier. It's just like really fucked-up people out there. Do you know... you know the story of Betty Short? Who the fuck is that? The Black Dahlia. Oh the chick with the smiley? - Yeah, yeah. - That's gnarly. She was just like us. She was trying to like make it in Hollywood. She was... she was... She was an aspiring actress. She wanted to be a movie star. She did whatever it would take. And people o... And people offered whatever she needed. She would... She was hitchhiking sometimes and... and staying in people's houses. You know, the last person who saw her alive was giving her a ride from San Diego to Los Angeles. I mean... She sounds like a real train wreck. Yeah, but it's like a slippery slope. I'm not worried. You're really concerned about me, huh? Yeah. Don't want you to get hurt. You're cute, Frank. Very different from a lot of guys I normally uh, cross paths with. How do you mean? Oh my God, just all these... These alphas jockeying to you know, see who'll win the pissing contest. It's just... I mean the idea of having concern for another person outside of themself is just... I mean there are girls like that, too, but I'm not trying to date any of them. I guess I'm not really trying to date those guys either. That are just the only ones that are around. Oh my God, it's so pathetic. Yeah, I hate that shit. Yeah, it's infantile. It's men giving men a bad name. Yeah, it's really sad. Especially the ones in the entertainment industry, they are so jaded and they feel so entitled to sex, like... Just because they buy you a dinner or something like that that that means you owe them something. It's just horrendous. I mean imagine putting somebody in a position like that is just disgusting. Yeah, I... I... Just fucking makes me angry thinking about it. Aww! Why would you... why would you think you could get away with that. And it's they get violent. Yeah. It's just... Yeah, there's no excuse for it. Horrendous. You're so sweet! Oh my gosh! People tell you that? No, they don't. I don't believe that. So what should we do uh, when we get to Vegas? Well, I think the first order of business should be getting a hotel room, don't you think? Take care of all of our uh, creature comforts. Oh, look at the moon! Found them. Do you want some? Uh, no, thanks. Uh, you... you clean up well. Well, it's a special occasion. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Uh, I'm sorry. I, um... Are you fucking serious? - I... I didn't mean to... - Wow! I... I was... I just thought that... Unbelievable, Frank. I'm really disappointed in you. - Wow... - I... You know what I... I really thought that... Let's just... You were someone that I... Could feel safe with. - I am, like... - Wow, it's... - Let's just forget that that... - No, you know what? - I'm so sick of guys like you. - I was just like... With your superior sensitive bullshit just biding your time, waiting for me to let my guard down. Go fuck yourself, Frank. Damn! Fucking idiot. I'm a fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Hey, you guys got a cigarette? No. Good night, Kenz. Oh, yeah, right. Simon, you coming in? No. I would, but I don't do water. So I'm sorry. You don't do water. How are we gonna save you if you don't get in the water? Is there like another way to save me or... It's very symbolic about being where you are, when you're under the water and then you die. And then you come up and you're reborn. Again. I'm t... I want to. I w... I do. I just... I can't. - Sorry. - Oh, come on. I'm sorry I don't swim. - Oh. - Oh. And I need you to get in this water with us right now. How are we gonna save you if you don't get wet? I mean is there... is that the only way? It's the only way. - There is another way. - There is? There is one other way. Awesome, down. I'm gonna need you to close your eyes. Okay, okay. Come closer, come closer. You... you're not gonna pull me in, are you? No, I'm not gonna pull you. Come on. I'm so scared, I don't know what you're doing. Okay. Okay, is that... I... am I saved? It's the first part. Okay. Okay, cool. Simon? Would you like to make sex with us? Oh, are you serious? Yeah. I'm so... no, I'm sorry. I uh, I... oh God. I don't... I don't have sex with women. - I'm sorry. - Oh, come on! Sorry, you guys are very beautiful. Don't be such a square. I'm not a square. I'm just... I'm... I'm gay. I can drown you in our - fuck sauce. - What? I can drown you in our fuck sauce. You guys are kidding, right? No! That's the deal, right? Um, that's very funny... Don't be so straight. It's a modern world and everybody has a little gay experience every now and then. So maybe you should have a straight experience with us. Listen, I... I respect you guys so much, I think you guys are amazing, but that's not... I don't... like I can't do that. Please, Simon. Like what kind of Christians are you guys? No, Christians don't have sex. Oh, oh, are you... are you... I guess you're not Mormon? - No. - What... what? So what... what are you exactly? It's our own sect. Your own set or sect? Sect. Sect. And what do you all practice exactly? Sex. Okay, cool. Oh, alright. So like I don't know what kind of like weird freaky-deaky cult you guys are in... And... and that's cool, like I said before, like I respect all like forms of expression, and spirituality, and like you know what? Like... You guys fucking pick me up, you guys are so sweet, but like I can't do this. I'm just here to witness. - You know like I'm... - Simon, isn't this beautiful? Isn't this God? Are you better than God, Simon? No, no, I'm... listen, I'm here... That's what it sounds like you're saying. So what are you writing about? Um, it's kind of hard to tell right now. I don't know what it is or what it's gonna be, but it's still part of my... My overall... You writing about us? - Uh, like not really, no... - Oh yeah. I'm just... just I'm expe... Like whatever I've experienced... - Oh! - Somehow in there, like the DNA of our adventure is in here somewhere. Still about what might narrative is about, like it's not exactly you guys that I'm writing about. - So what's the deal? - Oh! You get to write about us, what do we get? We've given you this. So, right? Oh. What do we get? I don't think our story is over, Simon. - Simon. - Simon. - Simon. - Simon. - Simon. - Simon. - Simon. - Hey, Simon. Simon. What's your daddy like? Hey, Simon. Hey, man. You know, we're just fucking with you, - right? - Okay. We're just trying to get you some good material to write about, brother. - Alright. - Okay? Let's go to Salt Lake. Hi, buddy. 1, 2, here we go. Ooh! Oh my God! - That's so good. - You like it? - You guys are so good. - That's cute. Did you... who wrote that song? That's old spiritual. - Oh! - Yeah. You guys are so talented. Oh, no, you're good. You're the one who's talented. Oh, you don't know that. You don't know that. It does... how does it go uh, - the old song and dance? - Oh! In America a man becomes who he is - on the road. - Yeah. Exploration, the rush for gold. Fortune, folly, and freedom! That's you, right? Uh, did you just read my um, my book? - No. - No, sir. We dreamed you. Remember? He was in Las Vegas, looking at the lights, like he'd never seen fucking electricity in his life. You were walking around just wide-eyed like a little boy. We woke up, we knew we're gonna come pick you up. Mak, was like, "We got to go get Simon." Huh. Huh. Here, drink some holy water. Just take a load off, man. What is this? That's holy water. Oh, you know what my favorite one is? Uh, it's the one you wrote a couple of years ago. Um, Melvin. - Melvin? - That's right. - That's your dad. - That's your dad. That's his dad. Didn't your... didn't your dad leave you as a baby... To go be a fucking star? Kinda like you, Simon? You will be a fucking star. Oh, where are we? Oh, God! Here. Alright, alright, alright, alright. Okay, okay, okay, okay. The smile I probably should have on seeing this first poem. Did you have it in there then? Or did some mellow malevolent monster infused you to move over and take you away to the nearest town to tell the tale of how you left me? What did it look like in New Orleans the first day free? Your shabby shack town house and your broken dreams. Fuck! Simon. What it takes to please the devil. No, I don't believe in the fucking devil! You want a taste of me? I don't believe in any of this, alright? What you do is fucking sick. When you could be gliding inside of our glorious pussy. I write good shit, I'm a good person. I'm... What did it look like? What did it look like in New Orleans your first day free? What do you say, Simon? I just wanna go home. Surrender to the Lord, Simon. What lord? The Dark Lord, silly. No, I'm not. Shut the fuck up! I'm not shit! No, I'm not! Shut the fuck up! You're shit. You're a fucking shit. We can help you, Simon. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I'm going fucking crazy. I'll do anything! I'll do anything! You are not funny like your dad. No, I don't wanna be anything like fucking Melvin! What the fuck do you know about Melvin? You're a... And what do you want, women? What do you want? Tell me now! What are you doing to me? Were the streets lined with pictures of me? Or were you too busy trying to be funny? Hey, y'all... y'all know what's happening here tonight? Oh, a real comedy show tonight, my man. - Comedy night? - Yeah. - Is it like a open mic? - Open mic. - Yeah, yeah. - Well. - Yeah, anybody can do it. - Yeah. I'm... I'm... I'm Melvin. - Hey, Melvin, I'm Andy. - Andy, I'm Melvin. How're you doing? I'm Nature Boy. - I'm the host of the show. - Oh, you're hosting? - Yeah, I'm hosting. - Nice. - Yeah. - Yeah. Can I get like five minutes on your mic? Yeah, we have space for you, yeah. Alright, y'all, we got another comedian. Uh, I just met this guy outside. I don't know how funny he is. I'm hoping he is. Y'all, give it up for Just Melvin. Make some noise. Make some noise, Melvin! Melvin. Melvin! You guys giving it up for Melvin, right? That's like the only time in my life anybody's ever given it up for Melvin like this. - So fucking right... - Melvin. Give it up for Melvin. Um, I'm Melvin. Um, I just started comedy. I um, I actually just moved to New Orleans uh, yesterday. - Whoa! - I just got here. Yeah. I'm 25. I think had like a... A quarter life crisis um, 'cause I was just going through a lot. My girlfriend she uh... She had a baby about seven months ago. And babies are expensive, right? Yeah, thank you for agreeing with me and saying "yeah". That wasn't even a joke, this's just real life. Babies are expensive, right? It's fucking pressure you know, trying to like maintain a 9:00 to 5:00, and be responsible, and be a family man, and shit, it's a lot of pressure. So fucking I left. So I was like, "Fuck this." "I'm... I'm moved to New Orleans," you know? Oh, man! Women always getting knocked down and getting right back up. That's... that's... that's what... Uh, I guess that wasn't funny. I just... I got something else for you guys. Um, I uh, just moved to New Orleans like I said. I uh, I um, just walking through the French Quarter earlier today. You know, I just arrived on Tuesday you know, um, and I saw a bunch of just women flashing their titties, and drunk people walking around, and pissing, and shitting everywhere. I was like, "Hell yeah, not Mardi Gras but a Tuesday" in New Orleans." Yeah, I guess what that... That's what a Tuesday in New Orleans is like and I... And I loved it. New Orleans. - Whoa! - Ooh! Hey, you guys... I'm... I'm Melvin and thank you for laughing um... Enjoy the rest of the show. That's all? That's all, huh? Hey, y'all, give it up for Mel. Yeah, Just Melvin is funny. Oh, real funny. What's this? This is Jackson Square. That's a real pretty park. Vegas prison. Lot of ugly shit happened here. Like what? Back in the day, around the same time I say it was a fucked-up place back in the day, man. You... you know they used to hang... Not only hang people, they used to defile people. Defile? Defile, man. They used to have this executioner dude, man. This guy was like the Michael Jackson of his time. They get big crowds out here, like bigger than the... Bigger... bigger crowd than like fucking you know, MC Hammer could draw. And the big ass crowd, they hit you know, all riled up. You have another cigarette? That's fucked up. Okay, okay, I'm just... You got a light? Didn't you smoke my last cigarette earlier? Oh, yeah. Well. I found this one in my pock... Oh man. I'll share with you. I got like... Alright, I feel you. The executioner, like he had this one dude. This is a nice... Nice sailor guy. He didn't want to fight in the war, no, he ran away from this you know, dude as it were when they caught his ass. They took him here and they broke with a little bitty hammer, like the smallest hammer that could still break bones, right? And he's breaking his bone, any bone, every bone, they broke his pinky, too. They broke the fem... They broke everything. And every time he screamed, they weeped and hollered for joy. Happiness and joy from the little boy's pain. Can you believe that? That's what our society did. They be like, "Goddamn, man, break some more bones." He be like, "No, I ain't got no more bones." They're like, "Yes, you do." They broke his ass bone, man. Yeah, man, this is Jackson Square, man. Jackson Square. It's a beautiful square. You can see the roses and the rose buds. It's weird how grass grows greener where blood has been spilt. That's deep. I know! Don't look at me like that. It's been nice hanging with you, man. Melvin, you're a great guy. But all these sad asshole stories make me wanna we get some white pussy. You ever had some white pussy? Not even like some Asian pussy? Any pussy? What kinda pussy? Well, I just had a baby about seven months ago. - Um... - Damn! Yeah, but I... I left my girlfriend. It was nice meeting you, man. It's nice meeting you, too, man. - Enjoy the... - Thanks. Enjoy the white pussy. I'll try. I hear it's the best. It's alright, glows in the dark. It's cool. Glows in the dark? Yeah, man, it glows in the dark, man, a dark night. Thank you. - How you doing, sir? - Good, how about you? Uh, not too bad. Um, listen, I'm... I'm here... I uh, I'm looking for this kid named "Joe". I heard that he worked here. You ever um... you know, who I'm talking about or... No, no, no. Um, didn't somebody like that... You know, somebody named - that uh, used to work here? - No. I'm the only person who's ever worked here. So you see, you own the place uh... Right.
