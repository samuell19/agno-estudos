I can barely wait, the sun and saltwater. And sex. Can't you think of anything else? How can I when I'm looking at you? What kind of panties are you wearing? Remind me, I have to call home when we arrive or my mom will kill me. Why do parents always think their kids will get killed if they vacation alone? What panties are you wearing? Please say it. They're dark. They're lacy. With a string. And the string cuts right between my butt. - Show me. - Tommy. Come on. Higher. Higher. That's nice. - Not here. - Why not? The door is closed. No one can see a thing. The conductor's already been here. And we won't reach the next station for 30 minutes. - Don't be such a tease. - I'm not a tease. - Yes you are. - Bull. - Of course you are. - Bull. - You are. - Am not. Stop it, you're tickling me. Friends, we have some more sad news this Wednesday evening. Another ghastly murder has caused a stir in our town. A man in women's clothing was spotted. That's probably the only clue. With me today in the studio is Dr. Einer Sprock. You're supposed to call the office, it sounded important. Now, young lady, don't you ever say hello to your father anymore? - Hi Dad. - Hi Jeanette, now that's better. - What's that you're reading? - Les Misérables. And in French, naturally. - Mais, naturellement. - How is it? It's really hard. Anyway, I don't know why I have to read this stuff. 'Cause it just so happens your mother's French and she wants you to. Why couldn't you marry someone from this country? 'Cause I couldn't find any girl as pretty as she is. - So where is your mom? - In the kitchen. She's making supper. Would you like some more salad, chérie? Non, merci, Mom. - Want more salad, my dear? - Just some cheese, sweetheart. Il faut manger, Jeanette, s'il te plait. Oui. It looks like there's a bad storm setting in. The weather here is awful, don't you think? As if the weather is better in France. We would be better off. - Papa, Scooter is scared of rain. - Jeanette. But, Mom, I can't say that to Dad in French. He wouldn't know what I was saying. - When she's right, she's right. - Yes, but a deal's a deal. She's supposed to say everything in French when she's on vacation. But not when she wants Papa's attention. Scooter can sleep in your bed. He'll be better off like that. He'll need a nice cozy place to stay warm. Merci, Papa. Come on, Scooter. Anne, what about your poor freezing husband? Will the beautiful princess help him stay warm? Papa, the lights just went out. Cheri, call an electrician and tell him to come immediately. Michelle, it's 10:00. It's just the storm. I'm sure we'll have electricity in a few hours. Okay, let's go to bed now. Tomorrow is another day. I thought Scooter was sleeping with Jeanette. How come? The lights. Has everyone gone deaf around here? Scooter? Go away from here. Now! I'm going to count backwards from three. When I get to one, you're going to wake up. Three... two... One. Everything okay? Fine. Did I pass the test? Jeanette, this wasn't a test. No, of course not. You're just forcing me to remember my past for the fun of it. I didn't force you, I'm trying to work with you to find out what happened. Weren't you trying to get me to forget it all during the last 10 years? How can that work if you insist on reminding me every session? Do you recollect anything? Anything at all? No, so just accept it. I don't want to know what happened afterwards. Martin, I'm alive. He didn't kill me, that's what really counts. - Jeanette, when you-- - Martin, please. Please, I want to live a regular life, like every normal woman should. Duck! It's Darth Maul. He isn't really dead. His soul has slipped into a human body. He wants to destroy me. Oh, my dear. She's completely lost her mind. I could save her soul. She's just ridiculous. She's cuckoo. Jeanette, tell her I'm not crazy. How long have we known each other? For 10 years, Greta. For you. You know, you're right. - What are you saying? - You should have a normal life. I don't have the right to keep you here any longer. That's not what I meant. I probably couldn't survive out there anyway. That's nonsense, of course you can. I've been watching you. You're strong and very attractive. You should be out there, living in the real world. One day you're going to fall in love and start a family. - What is that? - I have a job for you. - What kind of job? - You are going to teach French. A friend of mine is looking for a private tutor to teach his children how to speak French. Private tutor? He'll be at a convention but his housekeeper will be there. They live in the country so you don't have to worry about the stress of living in the city. That's why I've been pushing you so hard lately. I've been trying to prepare you for this. I won't ever leave here. Ever. Of course you will. You know it's for your own good. Take care. What about this file from Jeanette Feelman? We still need it? I wish I knew the answer to that. Hold on. You're not going anywhere. - Hey asshole, slow down. - Come on, go. Get out of here. Get out of here, you jerk. You see that possum? Huh? Where's that? - Thank you. - Good bye. Thanks. Thanks. You can't be serious. It's totally out. Nobody wears that stuff today. Gotta hang up. I'll call you later. Bye. Hi, no matter what you're selling, we don't want any. I'm Jeanette Feelman. - Bonjour, mademoiselle. - Bonjour, comment ça va? I'm afraid "bonjour" is my only French word, but that's why you're here. Come in. I'm Leon and this is my sister Melissa. - Hi. - Hello, I was ringing the bell. I didn't hear a thing, did you? Not a peep. We would have picked you up if you had phoned. Yes, your father did offer to pick me up. Who's that? The guy who was married to our mom before she passed away. - Tall, gray hair, nice teeth? - You got it. Must have had to leave for the convention. Convention? They told you he was at a convention? How original. - A sex convention. - But now he's gone and you're here-- what should we call you? Miss Feelman? Jeanette? - Madame Professor? - Jeanie. - Jeanie sounds sweet. - Jeanie. Okay, then. - No bags? - Actually, I left them in front. We'll go get them and I'll show you to your room. Okay. They're gone. I left them right here, I swear. Did someone take them inside? - Who would? - Lust is off today. - She takes care of the household. - She wouldn't take your bags anyway. - You have a younger sister, don't you? - Lissy? - Yeah, where is Lissy? - I don't know, but she sure wouldn't carry your luggage upstairs. - Yeah, she's still in bed. - Yeah, but with whom, I wonder. Maybe a miracle happened and your bags are upstairs. All right, here's your room. But no bags. Maybe your housekeeper came and collected the luggage-- No, we would've noticed that. Lust would rather jump off a cliff than show up on her day off. Yeah, well, my bags must be somewhere. - Do you have a gardener? - Nope. - Any neighbors? - No, not really. If you want to go shopping now, I'd love to go along. I need all sorts of stuff. You just can't wait to get that junk Ella's been talking about. Don't panic. Your bags will turn up. We'll leave you alone now. - Clean towels are in the bathroom. - Thanks. Let me know if you need anything. Sorry, but the pipes are a little rusty. You just have to let the water run for a while. - Some wine? - No thanks, I don't drink alcohol. - What else do you do? - I teach French. - I mean after work. - I see. I do a lot of walking and I read lots of books. Thank you. Sounds great. Very exciting. If I were that disciplined I'd be done with school by now. Yeah right, Leon. That would be the day. Yeah right, you should talk. Tomorrow, I'd like to see how far along you are. Tomorrow? No more summer. Ketchup? Oh, yeah. Can you call your sister to join us over here to see if she knows where my luggage might be? No problem if she shows up. She could be in the stable. The light's on. I think you're wrong. Lissy would never go to the stable alone. She hates it there. Yeah, but the light was on. There's nobody there. Lissy? No lights. They're broken. There's nothing here. We have to hurry so we can get to the movie on time. You must be mistaken, there's nobody here. I'm going to the house. I'm going to get dressed. That'll take four hours. What's upstairs? Upstairs? Nothing. Just some old bits and pieces. Would you like to go to the movies with me? Come on, it will be fun. That's nice of you, thanks, but I'm still very tired after the journey. Another time, all right? - Good night. - Good night. I found your luggage. They were in front of the house. You probably left them in the taxi and forgot all about them. - I brought them up for you. - I did not do that. And a dress is missing. It's knee-length with flowers. Knee-length with a flower pattern? - Hello? - Jeanie, why would anyone want to steal your dress? That's nuts. We gotta go or we'll be late. Bye. Ciao. Just a moment. I'm going with you. So cool, yeah. Who the hell is that? - Where? - There in front of you. There? I know what happens, I bet he'll rape her and then cut her throat. First he'll cut her and then he'll do her. Well... better her than me. Good God, Jeanie. What's with you? - You startled me, that's all. - I apologize. That isn't my kind of movie. Would you let me get you something to drink now? Come with me. All right, there. Here's your cheeseburger, Lissy. - Thank you. - Two Cokes please. - Hey, Leon, what's up? - Hey. Let me introduce my charming little sister Lissy. You've been keeping your girlfriend a big secret. This is Jeanie Feelman, our new tutor. I don't believe it. You're really hot looking. I was expecting some gray-haired old lady with thick glasses. - Thanks. - Eew, shoot. These pickles taste like rubber. Who likes them on hamburgers anyway? Why not leave them in the trash where they belong? Lissy's an expert on fast food. Breakfast begins with Coke and fries. Have you ever tried the Big Kahuna burger? Excuse me, I gotta get back to Mike. He's so cute, see ya. Please. Her big love. - Yeah? - Yeah, right, for at least 15 minutes. - Here's your two Cokes. - Thanks. Sorry I made you miss the film tonight. No problem. Don't you want to see it? I can't leave you here alone. Thanks, that's nice of you. - Terrible, just terrible. - Would you like a different soda? - No, the film. - I see. It wasn't a master-piece, but it wasn't so awful. I just have a hard time with horror films. They're really popular right now. All boys think about is making out, you know. Would you take me home? Ella's really pissed. Now she's flying to London by herself. You think Paul was glad? We wanted to go to Ibiza. You're not the only one who had to change their schedule. - Our trip's ruined too. - What if Dad freezes our credit cards? That would blow. If you do well in French, I could convince him to let you travel. I can't guarantee anything, but it wouldn't hurt to try it. You'd really do that? I'll call Ella. Without you, the phone company would go broke. - Did you want to kill us? - Where's my cell phone? There's somebody out there. Didn't you see that? - I hit my head. - What? There was someone standing on the street. I didn't see anybody. Did you, Mellie? Lift your feet. There was somebody standing right out there. He was standing on the right-hand side. It could have been a deer you saw. I got it. Why'd you do that? Jeanie said she saw someone standing on the road back there. - Who was it? - Somebody. There was somebody standing with a sickle in his hand. Do you think we shouldn't have taken her to that horror picture? Let's just go back to the house. Go away from here. Now! Doctor, I can save your soul if you let me. You are a liar, Martin. You can't fool me. You're a schizophrenic. - Yeah-- Jeanette. - Martin? No, I'm not in the middle of anything. - What happened to the man after? - What man? The man who killed my parents. You said a neighbor came by and found me there. What happened to the man after he was apprehended? Why do you want to know? You told me that they put him in a mental hospital. - Right. - For life? Or did they let him out of there again? Listen, Jeanette, I will not discuss this on the telephone. You never wanted to know before. Why ask now? I want to know if he ever got out again, if they thought he was cured, or if he escaped. And I think maybe he's looking for me, because I think he still wants to kill me. Are you having problems with the kids? - No, I only want to know if-- - Yes, you already said that, but why exactly? Is he out here? That is absolute nonsense. - You promise me that? - Yes, Jeanette. I'm sure of it. Okay, thanks. I'll call you again, ciao. Marian, would you check my calendar? I need a few days off. I have to take a trip. - All right. - I could have saved your soul. - Good morning, I'm Miss Lust. - Good morning. You must be Jeanette Feelman. It's disgusting, isn't it? Melissa always freezes them, sometimes unwashed. It prevents runs from getting in them. She puts them next to our food. Are you hungry? Would you like anything to eat? I'll have a little breakfast with the others-- You'll have to wait a few hours, they don't come down before noon. I see, yeah, then I'll have a cup of tea, please. Oh, here's Tiger, Lissy's cat. You'd better not pet him. He scratches. I apologize for not being here yesterday. It was my day off and I wanted to stop by, but the ski-lift was being repaired so I couldn't use it. Why do you need a ski-lift in the summer? My house is on the mountain. It would take me a whole hour to get here by car and the lift only takes minutes. - Here. - Thanks. Are they behaving themselves? - What do you mean? - The kids here. Your students. Yeah. I have to say, I feel a little sorry for you having to spend the whole day alone with them. How come? They said a lot of awful things regarding learning French with you and wasting their whole summer hanging around here. These things I wouldn't want anyone to hear. Just awful, just awful. I think I've cleared that up already. So, I think I'll go wake up my little rascals. Oh really? Good luck. Okay, now we speak French, and to begin, I would like to-- translate the first few sections alone, that way we can see how far along you have progressed. Okay? Can we at least do it on the patio? Naturally. Thank you. Can you do it? Yeah. If I have any problems, may I come back and ask you? Of course you may. I'm glad I don't have to put up with that noise tonight. After studying all day, they certainly deserve a change of pace at night, - don't you think? - A change of pace? You've never been to a party here before. I thought I saw a light on earlier in the stable. I can't imagine that. No one's been there since-- quite a while. Sometimes I hope that place is struck by lightning and burned to the ground. Why do you say that? You see, my child, life is easier if you don't know everything. I can't concentrate with that thing beeping all the time. - My mailbox is full. - Then empty it. I would, but my code's wrong. Women and technology. Here I come to the rescue. I'm finished for today. Have a nice evening. - Same to you. - Thank you. - Hey, Ella. How you doing? - The wet T-shirt contest's over there. - Hey, how ya doin'? - Good party. How did you get in here? Come here. Everybody listen up. George and me, we're the jury, huh? Hey, girls, I think it's obvious who's gonna come in first place. Ella, Ella, Ella. Hey now, I'm completely neutral. Yeah, right. Rule number one. If you want to win, you have to take your bras off, okay? - Otherwise we won't see anything. - I'm not wearing one. If Claudia takes her bra off, her tits will go down to the floor. Lissy's quitting school. She's starting a brand new career. Have you heard? She'll be a carpenter-- flat as a board, but easy to screw. Hey, what's the answer? The wet T-shirt contest, we'll do it. Come on, Leo, forget about Ibiza, and go with me to London. - City of love, boy. - That's Paris, Ella. Are you ready? Where's Ella? I can't go anywhere, I'm grounded. Try to understand that. Hello there. Yeah, we'll be right there. The others are waiting. The party is getting better already. May I introduce you? Jeanette, this is Ella. There seems to be a stray dog in my room. Oh my God, did she find those clothes at a thrift store? Close your mouth and go take care of your dog. It's nice that you came. I'm sorry that Ella has such bad manners. Would you like a drink? No, I'm going upstairs again. Stay for just a bit. Do you have any water or juice? Nothing non-alcoholic out here, but I'll go get you something. All right, everyone get wet. Hey! Wait for me. Paul! Here's somebody who probably wants to join our little party. Very good, take your bra off. Yeah, come on in, Jeanette, let's see how stacked you are. - You're bonkers. - Hey, Jeanie, you should try it. No one's ever died in our pool. Here, Jeanette, I'll even help you. - No, thanks. - Let's undress her. - She's hot. - Don't do that. Cut it out. Oops, I guess she's shy. What happened? She wouldn't have won with those stubs. We were just having some fun. Ella sometimes does stupid things. We're sorry. Okay, I understand, you're still angry. - Ciao. - Thanks. Ella, want a ride? No-oo! He won't take a hint. He won't stop bothering me. He's like a venereal disease. Then I hope you get well soon. Have I told you about my brand new water-bed yet? I'm really tired. My parents are in Monte Carlo. I'm all alone tonight. Don't you want to try my bed tonight? Oh, come on, Leo. Good night. And my name is Leon-- Leon, the dude, not Leo, the geek. Admit it, you have a crush on that tutor bitch. - Later. I'm gonna borrow your bike. - All right. Sleeping here? You know what? I'm going to London without you. I think you should give this to her. Shit! Son of a bitch. George left already. All right, I'll take you to your house. But I'm not staying. You can just forget it, I'd rather walk. Xavier, Xavier, come on! Xavier. Xavier, come back here. Hello? George. Stop hiding and give me a ride home already. That's very funny. Hey, you. Why don't you come out already? Come here, Xavier. We have a ride home. Hey, Xavier. What are you doing down there? Come here, come to Mommy. Hi there, this is Ella. Sorry I'm not home, but you can reach me on my cell phone at 855-0761. Hi there, it's Ella. Leave a message at the tone. That babe must be hot as hell, as often as he's here. Please, forgive me. Mademoiselle Jeanette. Excusez-moi, mademoiselle. Pardon, madame. Pardon, mademoiselle. Forgive me, mademoiselle. - Oh, Leon. - Please, forgive me. Please, forgive me. Eew, this mess is disgusting. Good morning. The others are still asleep, aren't they? That was fun yesterday. We should wake them up again. No, I promised to let them sleep in today, - because of their party. - You're much too nice to them. How was it last night? Ouch, that damn cat. Their friends are really dreadful. The whole group is just dreadful. You can't trust any of them. Especially this devilish trio. I don't agree. I think they're completely normal. Not really. They show their worst side to the adults around here. The worst is yet to come. Miss Lust? What is in the stable? Why do you ask? I saw you go there yesterday on your way home. - Did you go inside? - No. Leon found his mother in there a few years ago. She hung herself from the rafter, 'cause her husband had a mistress. - She was a wonderful woman. - Oh, God. - Those poor kids. - No. There's never been any mourning for her in this place. Why can't we take care of things here? 'Cause we gotta overhaul everything at the end of the season like every year. We can only do it at the depot. I'll go ahead. You take the other truck. I just don't understand this. I once knew a Frenchman and we got along without words. Leon, your apology was very sweet, really. You're no longer angry? It wasn't your fault it happened. I still would like to make it up to you. Would you let me show you around the area? There's some beautiful areas you've really gotta see. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. How the hell can you eat after all that? I didn't have anything to eat all night. Hey, look at that. He didn't either. Isn't this lovely? It's really something. Come here. Leon. I thought you had fallen down. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. You didn't offend me. That's good, what if I catch you? Then can I kiss you? You're not gonna catch me. What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid. Yeah, you are. You're afraid of being touched. Of being touched in every way. I'm not afraid. It's just that-- it's just that-- There was a terrible accident in town. A drunken tourist laid down in front of a snowplow and must have gone to sleep. Yeah, and the next morning the workers came - and turned the snowplow on and-- - We're eating. All right. Where is Lissy? Will she be joining us for supper tonight or does she eat those CDs she listens to? I don't think she's coming. Oh, my mailbox is calling me. I just don't get this. If you want to delete it, all you have to do is take-- I don't mean the phone, you moron. Ella hasn't called me once all morning. It costs a lot to call from London. What? She took off and left. You aren't serious? That sucks. I'd love to be where she is now. Sauce? Some sauce? Don't worry, just a power failure. Lissy was playing with the stereo and blew a fuse. Need a towel? Here you are. I'll be going now. Leon. Do you think you could stay here with me? If you'd like to stay with me. Go away from here. Now. What's wrong with you? What is it? It was just a dream. I've dreamt it several times before, but today was the first time it went on. What was it about? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Finished. How did you do that so fast? WANT TO GO SWIMMING LATER? That's a very original translation. But I understand. Leon? Hurry up, girls, the stores are closing soon. - Always a rush. - Why can't they stay open longer? Since when do you have a license to drive? - Maybe you'd rather walk. - Just asking. Melissa and Lissy are probably wondering why you didn't go to town. Jeanie, I believe that I'm in love with you. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. - That's disgusting. - Oh God. Oh God. - Forget it, who care what she believes? - Oh, you're no different. - Just like your papa. - You shut your mouth. Don't you talk to me like that or I'll-- Or you'll what? You'll quit? Wow, a cause for celebration. These sure are nice French lessons. I'll tell your father what's going on around here. And we'll see what happens then. I'm sorry. I'm going in now. Jeez, that guy's still there. He must never get tired of her. Who cares where it happened? We're shooting the scene here. It's a great location. Come here. Hold on to this. Hello, what's going on here? They're here to talk about the human hamburger that we ground. Mention that when we're shooting-- human hamburger. Say that to the camera. And make sure you don't say anything about it being an accident. Say it was some lunatic slasher. It's good for our ratings. - We don't have any lunatics. - Yeah, that's nice. This set is closed. Would you mind leaving? Not at all. Cut it out, asshole. Udo, don't do that, be quiet. Camera ready. In this small village that residents would call a paradise from the large cities, some folks here would say that things have changed since yesterday. A lunatic has unleashed his terror in this tiny hamlet. These two men were witnesses yesterday of a gruesome incident that shook this tiny town to its core. I'm gonna find another job. Did you get all that on camera? Yeah, Martin, it's Jeanette. Call me back. It's a matter of work. I think I screwed up with my job. Yeah, see you later. Ciao. - Martin? - 10 years. Hello? Who is this? Hello? Don't you remember what happened? What is it you want from me? I've done it again. Go away from here. Leon? Lissy? No! There's a reason for amnesia. You won't heal until you remember what happened that night. You won't heal until you remember what happened that night. Leon? Lissy? Melissa? Where are you? Leon, what's wrong? We didn't hear a thing. She's blown her mind. We can forget the rest. You're exaggerating. She's not reacting very much. This is ridiculous. I swear, take a look for yourselves. Jeanie? - Say something. - Hey, Jeanie, it was just a joke. We stole your dress. We didn't mean you any harm. Yeah and Paul wore it because you spoiled our trip to Ibiza. We were just getting even, that's all. - It was just a show. - Hey, where the hell is Paul? I don't know. I told you guys, she can't hear you. Jeanie, snap out of it. You're giving me the creeps. See, I told you so. She's out of her head. She looks insane. - Hello? Snap out of it. - Wait a second. Jeanette Feelman, clean your act up. I'll try it harder. What do we got to lose? Cut it out, she's catatonic. Just forget it. It's all your fault. It was your idea. You didn't want her to spoil our summer vacation any more than I did. You went way too far this time, Leon. This girl is now comatose. And you slept with her too. You're so disgusting. That thing was Paul's' idea. Don't get mad at me. - Who's the one who did it? - How could you be so fiendish? Like it or not, we're all in this thing. What are we gonna do now? We'll deny the whole thing. - What? - All of it. We don't know a thing. How would we know anything anyway? How could anyone know I downloaded her medical report online? He's got a point. You two take her back to the house. I'll get this mess cleaned up. And then? Tomorrow, if she doesn't wake up, we'll call a doctor. That way he'll confirm that Dad sent us a lunatic. All right, go. What should we do with the walls in that room? We'll cover the whole thing in red paint. If anybody asks, we'll tell them we're redecorating. Okay. - Let's go. Take her feet. - Okay. - Got her? - Yeah. Come up and help me afterwards. Cut it out, Paul, she's gone crazy. Of course she's crazy. Just look at her. - Paul, just stop it. - What's your problem? Scared, huh? Leon? Leon? Cut it out, Paul, something went wrong. Come down here. I got a big fork for you. Cut it out. Help me. I'm going there. I'm on my way. Look at this thing. Who wants to fight me? Who wants to fight? Shit. Let it ring, could be anybody. Let's answer it. - Hello? - I'd like to talk to Jeanette. - He wants to talk to Jeanie. - Who? - Who is this? - My name is Dr. Martin Lenz. One moment. What should we do? It's her doctor. Shit! Just say Jeanie isn't here. - What? - Give it to me. Hello? Hello, I'm Melissa. We once met at a get-together. - You know my father. - Well, I'm looking for Jeanette. - Can you tell her I'm on the phone? - I'm afraid she's not here. She's away at the moment. Please tell her I'm on my way to your place, would you? Shit. He's coming here. - She's gone. - How could she be gone? She was just here. Where did she go? I don't know. What was that? - What's she doing in the kitchen? - Take a look, I'll keep him occupied. - What's going on there? - Nothing. Maybe she's out walking right now. Maybe. You did what?! It was just for fun, but why did she kill the cat? Now, the first thing you have to do-- and I mean now-- is to lock the doors and don't come out until I get there. - Why is that? - Oh, God. - You don't know what you've done. - What? This wasn't even in her file. You've triggered something in her subconscious that is catastrophic. You must do as I say. What should we do now? The madman that killed Jeanette's mother and dad died that same night. Jeanette did it. She killed him with the sickle he had used to kill her parents. In her condition, she's a danger to anyone she comes in contact with. Be careful, I'll be right there. She killed the guy who murdered her parents. She might have snapped. I'm up here. Go to the kitchen and get a knife. Leon? Oh God, is he dead too? Leon? - You asshole. - This is no time to screw around. I thought it was Paul. I wanted to shock him. But Paul is not-- Where's Jeanette? - I'm getting out of here. - What is wrong with you two? Paul is dead, he's been killed. He's downstairs. - This whole thing is unbelievable. - She put Tiger in the blender. - What the hell are you talking about? - I just talked to the doctor. Jeanie's a murderer. What? Jeanie killed the man who murdered her parents. We'll all die, one by one. Here, give me the knife. Get behind the door. Oh, God. That isn't her. - That's Martin. - He's dead. You killed her doctor. This is the same place that Mom killed herself. - Maybe this is our punishment. - What the hell are you babbling about? - I just killed this guy. - You're such an asshole. Who's there? The police. We have to call for help. No way, we're gonna have to figure out what to say. This is where she works, Stefan. Poor family. It's gonna be a shock for them, finding out the housekeeper was killed like that. Yeah, what a lousy way to go. - Miss Lust is dead? - It was Jeanie. She must have lost it a lot sooner than we thought. I think they're out for the night. Come on. We'll come back tomorrow. This is kind of a scary place, you know that? What was that? A lunatic... who's waiting for us to open the sliding roof. All this crap the last couple of days is driving us crazy. Okay, they're gone. I had nothing to do with it. We're gonna blame that lunatic woman. One or two more or less won't matter. I'm scared. Let's get out of here. How can we? Oh shit, we need the car keys. Somebody has to get them from the house. We'll toss for it. I'll be right back. Damn it. Hello? Who's calling me? Please don't. Mellie! It came from the pool. Now's our chance. Come on, let's get out of here. Go to the car. - I told you to meet me by the car. - I didn't want to be by myself. We can't leave Mellie here all alone. Then look for her, I'm leaving. We gotta get out. No, don't do it. Don't do anything. It was Mellie's idea. And Lissy wanted to. Both of them forced me to do it. Honest, Jeanie. Oh, God. I really love you. Come on. Put that down. Come here. I wanna kiss you. You were the best. I always loved you. I'll count backwards from three. When I reach one, you'll wake up. Three... ...two... one. Are you all right, Lissy? Yeah. And you still can't remember what happened after that? Do you recall anything? I don't remember anything. Quiet on the set. Roll sound.
