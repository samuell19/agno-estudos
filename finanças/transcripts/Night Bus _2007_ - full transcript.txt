Ever been there? How is it? Are you always so quiet? I listen to it to avoid talking nonsense! I'm talking nonsense? - Pour your heart out if you want. - Why so bitter? Go! Step on it! Don't tell me what to do! It's a bus, not a Mercedes! Understand, kid? I do. Mortars don't! They destroy both. I heard you telling commander you don't take POWs. Why? None of your business! Fine. But don't take it out on me. You're here now. - In war... - Don't lecture me about war, kid! In war, there's always one in command and that's me here! Got it? I'm not a soldier to obey anyone. Got it? Me neither. Nor a commander. I'm just a guide helping ... this banger reach destination. This isn't a banger, kid! I'm not a kid; though I'm your son's age. Never mind. Be quiet, then! I was a kid of only 16 in my hometown. Two days later, I was still 16, but no longer a kid. I thought if everyone abandons the battlefield, if nobody stands against the enemy, they'll twist the whole country around their fingers and... Did you say that at 16? Of course. I was born to command a battalion! So, one has to be born a commander. Two days after the war began, my father sent the family to my uncle. He remained and fought to death. I've taken his place ever since. That's why you forgot you were a kid. I got you talking at last! Look, kid. Ever since the country went down the slope, we've lost a piece of homeland whenever there was a war. Let's see what you kids will do this time. - You'd better get out just in case. - Take care, kid. Thank God! Come here, Emad. The base. Come in. - Who is that ? - The base. - Tha base called me ? - Yes, Come. What's the matter ? Is it you, Emad? Reihaneh? What are you doing there? - I came to see you. - I told you I'd be back soon. Couldn't wait till then. Hear that? It's not the right time. Be quick. I must see you. OK. See you in the Café Fouquet down Champs-Elysées. OK? How I miss that place! Remember? How dreamy! Look, darling. Return if you wish; divorced or not. It's OK with me. - Who were you talking to? - I told you. The base. Very funny! Who were you talking to, not where! - Forget it. - Was it his wife again? Yeah. I reckon she summoned him! Attack and counterattack of a couple! That's all we need here! C'mon! I know what's best for my life. Why didn't you leave, then? 1 will, but not now Don't argue! I decide here. Ok. Are you sleeping? - Naser ! - Yes? Emad will go with them. Move it, guys! How are you? Where were you? Where were you? Tell them to stand up. Get up, all POWs. Hurry! Don't let them realize you're only two. Do anything necessary if they caused trouble. - You mean... - You heard me. Only us two? We stood against many tanks ... just to evacuate them. They're packed with information. We'll retreat when you're gone. You! Come here! - What was your name? - Faruq. He was captured alone behind our posts. Watch him carefully. He knows our language well. Must've been on recce. Tell them when you hand him over. To the right! To the right! To the left! To the left! To the right! Finished. To the right! To the right! Their tags. Hurry! Careful! Eesa! Why do we kill ? 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. See? They hit there. Take that route. But we came from here. We're under fire. This will lead us out too. OK. You know better. Haji said don't let them to know we are two, didn't he ? We should do some thing. It is dangerous. - Uncle ! - Yes? - I want to do some thing. help me. - What ? Repeat after me. I want them to think there are three tough guys. OK. - Help me. - OK. All miseries of war on one side, dirty windows on the other! They want to hide it. Didn't see such a big car. Hey, you! Don't whisper! Forbidden! No talking either. No talking either.Sit still! One wrong move and bang! Bullet, kill! Got it? My friend may tolerate whispering, but I won't. Be careful. I'm tetchy like the wounded! Got it? Got it? My friend won't bear any noise or wrong move. Nothing! Got it? I'm a fully grown-up man, gentlemen. I can calm down the young men if I try. But they're the ones who decide. Don't try their patience. Got it, I hope? He is my friend ... My friend says he's old. Old and Patient too. May convince the younger ones like me! But the younger decide. That's me again! Got it? Got it, Mr Eesa. Got it three times! Shut up, you! Shut up! Are you in pain? - Are you in pain? - I'm OK. - What's wrong with him? - He's epileptic. We have a doctor here. - Who's a doctor? - I'm a stager, not a doctor. Like a paramedic. Surely not with tied hands and blindfold. - Take care of him, kid! - Sure. Careful he doesn't trick you. ID card. In pocket. - Sirv... - Sirvan Fo'ad. Kurdish name. I'll undo the blindfold. Eyes on the patient only! I'll undo the blindfold. Eyes on the patient only! OK. Only treatment. Get up. Get up. 22222 Get up. OK. Eesa! Sirvan Fo'ad. Remember me? Do you remember me ? Not exactly. Train to Istanbul, 1981. Remember ? Emad! I'm fluent in Persian now. - You were with your wife, Miss Reihane. - Reihaneh. Miss Reihaneh. - They became friends! - What ? - They became friends! - That's life, kid. You understood them? I was a transit driver for 15 years. Look, kid. Each of these POWs is as close to us as those two. Kurds of this side and that side, Arabs of this side and that side, Turks of this side and that side; nations are not enemies. Then, why not going on a picnic together? Why not? However, fanatic party members are different. They're trained for killing and racism. They kill their own people ... like they kill us. Their leader calls us insects, but sprays his own nation with insecticide! Light a cigarette. - Do you smoke? - No, it's for him. You! Cigarette! Thanks. What's he saying? Water. Thirsty. - He wants water. - You talked again! Talking banned! OK. But we're all thirsty. You! Ok. OK! POWSs! Little water. Take a sip so everyone has some. Take a sip ... SO everyone has some. Got it? You! Come. Drink and stop nagging. Thank God you got it! Drink. Fill it up. Fill it up, kid. I am! What do you think I'm doing? Bickering with me! You! Take a sip. Here is a deadline. Open your eyes. Nothing can be done while the bus is moving. Calm down. I want to pee. What's he saying? He wants to pee. I didn't ask you! So what if you have to pee? I pee on the bus? No. Pee over me! We can't stop. Heavy fire! Got it? Give him something to pee in. He can't on the bus. I have no choice but to stop. Not because he wants to pee nor for Emad's eye. Can't stop here, man! The engine will blow up if we don't. The whole bus will blow up... if we do! It's breaking down. So we're dead either way. What do you say, Emad? There should be an old caravansary somewhere nearby if we haven't passed it already. What's the matter? Here's the result of having a good guide like you around! - What time is it? - Why do you ask? It's some time you haven't told me off! Stop bickering with me, kid! Open your eyes. It's almost over. Bear it. Open ypur eyes. - Eesa! - Yes? What's going on, Eesa? Careful they don't quarrel. Quieten them. Open ypur eyes. Quiet! No talking or making noise. Got it? We're in bad shape. How long stopping? Engine's failed. Must wait. Got it? Yes.We're tired and thirsty. How long? Asking for trouble, eh? What's your name? Your commander told you. Didn't you hear? Faruq. You're deep in trouble already. Wait till we reach the base. You! Name? Rank? Warrant Officer Sa'ed Sha'laan. Loyal to the leader to the last breath, ready to fight to the last minute. Giving a lecture, eh? You! You! Mohsen Jasem. No knowledge of arms. I'm a cook. Cook? Let's hope you're not lying! A You! Son! I have feelings. I have brain. I'm a human, not a murderer. They forced me to fight. You! Abbas Hamid. I miss my wife and children. So do l. Any idea when I last saw my mum? - You! - I don't say anything to you. I only talk to higher ranks. Do you, really? - You! - I'm Mohsen Jamil. Oh. Ok. You! You! Wake up! I want to give you an injection. - What kind of injection? - A painkiller. Eesa! Eesa! Come here. What ? What's this he wants to inject? I don't know. Let me see. It's OK. Take it. 1£'ll calm you. I won't if you can bear the pain. Give him the shot. I'm almost finished. Let's go. There's one thing left. What? Open the side trunk. The side trunk ? We're putting him there. Him? He's not luggage! - What shall we do with him? - Bury him. Emad. Did you hear him? I'm right. We were given 38 POWs. We'll deliver 38 too; dead or alive. We don't have time. I'm sleepy and tired. The bus won't move till you bury the poor fellow. Take him. God bless him. Sorry to keep you waiting. It's OK. It's safer in the dark. Right. Watch the step. Cover my eyes and tie my hands. You're offended for the shot? No. I want to be treated like the rest. I want to be treated like the rest. But you're different. You're Emad's friend. My friend proved we're at war. Do it! Doctor. Will his eyes ... Eesa, where are you? I'm coming. Will his eyes be okay? I don't think so. He's going to see his wife. Need anything? Need anything? No whispering! The road's closed. Is it? I don't know. They've changed the route. The road's closed. Eesa! The sky. I see it. I think we've taken the wrong path. Impossible! Not with a guide like you! Let's turn back. What a guide we have! Recognizing the wrong path It means I'm a guide! Ok. Not driving you into the enemy ... It means I'm a guide! Quite right! You deserve a medal of honour! I suggest you return to your transit line once you're finished with this mission. Don't you argue with me ever again,kiddie! Got it or not? Got it ? Eesa! Tell him some thing. Radio. Turn it on. Now? Yes! Ok. Adjust it to have a clear sound. Clear sound. For what? Hurry! That's it. Connect it. Hurry! That's it. Wow! What a mess! Tyre's flat, kid! Everyone off! Don't shout. Get them all off. - All off ? - Yes. How, in the middle of nowhere?title - The same way you got them on! I'll give you a hand. A few spiteful ones like Faruq and we've had it. Even if we do that... Look, kid! Ever travelled on a bus before? Once a front tyre goes flat, everyone has to get off even on asphalt. Let alone on a dirt road with an oil-leaking jack. They should weigh over 2.5 tons. I can't replace the tyre with them inside. I'm in command this time! Got it or not? Emad! I heard it. Don't worry. Nothing will happen. I won't worry with you around. But I'm... Yes... Don't worry. Don't let go of the rope. Don't let go of the rope. Don't let go of the rope. Careful ! Eesa! Poor fellows can't see. What do you think I'm doing? The steps! Careful ! Careful ! Stop! Come here. Stop! Move. I need you. Got it three times, eh? The younger ones decide. That's me! Got it? .32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. They're 37! It's correct. We buried one. Untie his hands! Tie his legs. Don't move. Bossing around, kid! Hold this. To left! Good! [Singing] Quiet! No noise! No singing! Got it? As if they're on picnic! Let them sing. Who cares if they sing here? It's dangerous. Too risky letting them sing together. Move them in, kid. Let go of the rope! 32, 33, 34, 35, 36... One's missing. We buried one of them. Apart from that. Did you count the one replacing the tyre? - Finished? - Yes. Untie his legs. Tie his hands. Don't move. Blindfold! - Look. Take it easy, son. - I'm not your son, bastard! You killed my father. How dare you call me son? What where you trying to see? I wasn't on reconnaissance. Put your hand in my pocket. - For what? - Put your hand in my pocket. Put your hand in my pocket. Let me see what's inside. A grenade? Look. It's your currency. I came to surrender myself, not to spy. Right. It's our currency. He's lying. Right. It's our currency. It's our currency. They do that in case they're caught. That's part of the job. You're right, but he may be telling the truth. It's not our job to tell who's lying and who's not. I never lie. Your money is in your pocket. It wasn't his fault, Eesa. His blindfold fell off. He saw what he shouldn't have seen. Why don't you understand? Kneel down! What do you want to do, kid? Mind your own business! Got it? Get on the bus. Had it been my son treating a POW like this... - I never lie. - Shut up! OK, shoot. But don't humiliate me! Is that how one treats a POW? That's what happens when you trust a kid. Who else is left to trust? He'll kill poor man! Drive on. A fork. Left or right? This way. - This way. - Sure? There's nothing to be sure about anymore. When sky's cloudy, one has to smell his way out. True or not, Emad? When sky's cloudy, one has to smell his way out. True or not, Emad? I got it. Rascal! Looking for an accomplice? OK. Count me in. I stand with Eesa all the time. What's your idea ? I couldn't bear seeing you in pain. - Thank God it's over. - Thank God 1000 times. Do you count when you thank God, kid? I was studying in London before the war. After getting married to Reihaneh, she moved there with her family. We hadn't finished our honeymoon when the war began. I told her I was returning. They were against the idea. I finally returned. My wife too. I begged her not to and she'd be lonely. But she wouldn't listen. The war had just begun. The airports were closed. We took the train. That's how I met Fo'ad. He used to study in London. He was dashing back to move his family to a safe place. However, he got stuck and was forced to join the military. I left Reihaneh with my relatives and rushed to the battlefield. It's three years now. During this time, her family's been trying to convince her to return,m and saying I'd die sooner or later. Her family's been trying to convince her to forget me, Poor girl doesn't know which to choose. It's awful having to live with uncertainty. Minefield! - What? - Minefield! Haven't you heard of it before? You drove us to the middle of a minefield? Was it me who planted the mines? You were born bitter! Good for you for being born sweet! - Didn't you think... - Please! We have to go back on the same track. But we must get everyone off first. Get them off? In case the bus goes up into the air! You mean the bus may... Look! One by one. Alright. Go ahead. Say something. You have to get off, Eesa. Look around the bus and defuse mines. Take this and wire cutter. It's in the glove box. Do you know how? Never done it before, but I've watched others doing it. I'll manage. Don't worry. I won't worry with you around. I'm sure you'll manage. Take it. It's armed. Keep an eye on them. I haven't even thrown stones at sparrows! You will when it comes to it. Come on. Move not! Move not! I'm an old man. But I'm cruel! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! I'm armed! - Good? - Yes. Don't move! I'm armed! Got it? - Are they all tied up? - What? - Are they all tied up? - Yes. Go. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36... One's missing! Why are you so dumb, kid? We buried... I've counted that one. Still, one missing. Drop your gun. Drop your gun. Now! Remember the instructions, Eesa? Shut up! I spent two years interrogating your POWSs. I understand what you say. Eesa! We had orders to retreat. - But we resisted to bring back the POWs - Shut up! - Shoot him, Eesa! - Don't! Don't say anything! Shoot him, Eesa! - Drop your gun. - Should I shoot or not? How? - Drop your gun. - Should I shoot or not? - Drop your gun. - I give up. OK. Let him go. Have the gun. It's yours. Shoot him. Stop. Down. Both of you! Ok. down. - Basal - Hands down. Easa! Eesa! I don't want to use a cane for the rest of my life. Shut up! I don't want to use dark glasses while people feel sorry for me. I don't want to live any longer. Why didn't you shoot, Eesa? Sit down. Sa'ed Sha'laan! You can't get far. You're kilometres behind our line. - You'll never make it. - Shut up! Our soldiers will caught you. Why didn't you shoot him, Eesa? You should shoot him. We gave you the gun. But this is a tricky bus. You can't get far on it. Really? Tricky bus! Bravo, old man! Be quiet. We'll untie you one by one. Be patient. No antitank mines on this field. We must clear a path the size of a bus and get away before daylight. - What next, sir? - They're content to be captives No point in freeing them or taking them along. However, we two can make it to the river. We need a guide to take us there. - Know anyone? - Farug, sir. He was a boatman. He's familiar with the region well. The guy caught on recce? Yes, sir. Him. Call him. Faruq! - Yes, sir? - Come. I told you! I need to talk to you in private, sir. Leave, Sa'ed. These POWs are happy with their captivity. They're difficult to control if untied. I don't know you. I used trade as an excuse to move freely across the river before the war. I collected information. Been rewarded several times. You're a great commander, sir. - You know me? - I can tell by your courage. I can see the medals of honour hanging on your chest, sir. Forget the medals for the time being. There's a lot we have to do. - Where's the other gun? - Shut up! Your situation won't get worse, Eesa. I should've killed you! - My son, eh? - Move! Emad! Emad! What? Do me a favour. Tell my mum how much I missed her. I've either been dreaming of her or thinking of her all these years. Eesa. I know you're talking, but I didn't get it. I can't hear anything. I wrote my wife a letter. It's in my pocket. I've told her all the things that don't come in words. Things I can't mention to her face to face. Make sure she gets it. I'll get on alone and drive as far as you tell me. Glasses needed. Bus needed. I'm old. Don't do that to the youth. I'll lead on the bus and - you follow my tracks. - Shut up! I never thought of divorce, Reihaneh. I'lL miss you but it's worth it when you live the way you deserve You have the right to live alongside your husband. Yet, I don't deserve blame. I never anticipated a war to break out only two weeks after we married. I was studying abroad to return and serve my country. But when there is no homeland... I can't close my eyes on the disaster. I feel better when I'm involved. Go abroad if you feel better. It's fine with me. Whichever way you want it. But I must stay to free our homeland! I can't think otherwise. Forgive me, Reihaneh. However, I must keep my faith to be able to keep you. I'm ashamed of you. Sa'ed. ??? Ok. ??? ??? I didn't want to do anything. Faruq! See to the oldie. We need him. Can't rely on the bus. Where's the other gun? Get off. I need to change my trousers. Your situation won't get worse. - Is he better? - Yes. Yes, sir! Were you not trained? I only learnt what I liked to learn! - Where are you from? - I'm not from any party. Idiot! You owe your life to the party. Listen to him! We owe our life to the party! We owe only our deaths to the party! The party started this war, brothers killing brothers. Damn you! These insects are your brothers? You're a traitor. Traitors are those who wipe the smile off people's lives, set fire to the fields, dry the springs, and turn lush green valleys to dry deserts. Hey! We need a stager more than anyone else. That gun is empty. Emad! Emad! Emad! Faruq! Aren't you my compatriot? My mother belonged here. My father belonged there. Where do I belong? Eesa! Emad! Stay where you are. I'm coming. Follow the track. Quisling! The officials shall hear about your betrayal. Your family's ruined. My family was ruined a long time ago. Two brothers on the run with a sister and brother executed. Like millions of others that were shot dead and buried in mass graves. What had they done wrong? They refused to prostrate before the great leader.They refused to join the party. Hold the torch. Where's Emad? No idea. I lost him. Lost him? Careful. Follow the track. Take it. Emad! - He is missing. - What? What's wrong? Emad's missing. Eesa went to find him. Emad! Easa! Emad! Emad! Emad! Emad! Emad! Guys! Look! That's what's left of Emad. Only this! You wished to be free? Go ahead! You're free. I'm in command of the POWs. It's my duty to help them escape. Didn't you tell Sa'ed they were content with being captives? You wanted to take the bus and escape alone before daylight. According to Geneva Convention, you have no right to mistreat a POW. - Shut his mouth! - Hold on, Eesa. A person leaves his hungry family and comes to our country to work. To extend his work permit, you force him to fight at war; cannon fodder. Isn't that against the Geneva Convention? - It's a lie! A big lie!I - A lie? - Which of you is from Lebanon? - Me. - How about Morocco? - Me. Me. - Yemen? - Sudan? - Egypt? - Tunisia? - Me. - Algeria? - Me. I was born on the other side of the river. You on this side. We were friends for many years. Friendship, socialising, romance, marriage. A girl from this side in love with a boy from that side and vice versa. Like my own father. He fell in love with my mother and I was born! Hen we start fighting and killing each other all of a sudden. Right. We weren't enemies. The two nations were never hostile. My brother wished to build a bridge over the river so our families come to your side to have traditional ice cream and your families come to our side and have fun in our city in the cinemas, cafes; Vahideh Khalili, Omm-e Kalthoum! Eesa! Eesa dear? Eesa! What shall we do, kid? Turn back and don't nag, please. They've advanced so far? Faruq! Take this. What happened? Enemy tank approaching. No chance to get away. Told you it was the wrong way. We would've been up in the air if we hadn't come this way. This way, that way, left, right, and we're in the air now! It's no time to quarrel. We'll find a way. Hey, brother! Hey, Hey! Oh, my God! Tell them we have 37 POWs and there are four gunmen threatening to blow up the bus if they don't let us pass. I'm a POW. I'm a POW. Me and 37... No! 38 other POWs. 4 armed men. They'll blow the bus. What are you saying? I only realised 38 POWs. We've seized the same number of tanks. They're at the carwash in the base for cleaning! We're practicing driving with this one! That's a fake POW. Where are you coming from? From hell! Nice journey! - Pardon. - What? From Heaven. Nice journey again! The grenade's fake too. So is our enemy! Good for you! I'll move so you may pass. I'm from that side of the river. You from this side. We've been friends for many years. The girls from this side in love with the boys from that side... C'mon! Stop chattering. Good bye. My brother wants to build a bridge across the river for our families to travel to this side and have ice cream! Return, please. It's carrying POWs, not soldiers. - Don't close it. - Sorry, madam. - Open it. - I can't. - Open it. - It's carrying POWs, not soldiers. Open it. I can't. Eesa! Remove their blindfolds. No. I got them blindfolded and I'll hand them over so. Open your eyes. Sister! You'll get me in trouble. Emad? He didn't come? Why are they looking at me like that? Any idea when they last saw a human being? Let alone an angel! They were blindfolded. But you weren't. Where's Emad? Look ... Are you his bride? I'm his wife. - That's what I mean. - He didn't come? I have a message from him. Help these out! One moment please, madam. Be frank with your sister. I'll never do otherwise. Let me hand over the POWs first. Eesa! Your gun. Sir! Have we met before? - Eesa! - Let him stay. Miss Reihaneh. I'm Sirvan Fo'ad. The train guard nagged. You got angry. You argued. He apologised but you wouldn't accept Emad tried to convince you, but he failed. Emad ... That was all. No. Three are missing. Only the doctor. He's over there. There should be three more. In the glove box under the seats, or somewhere else. Open it. How about your family? Did they reach a safe place? My family? As long as these people are in power, our families will never feel safe anywhere. Untie him,Eesa. I owe him a few slaps. Don't, Eesa! Enough of spite and animosity. Why? Why? Control yourself. You're like him now. Don't let that happen. - Teach him to be like you. - Alright. A pigeon fancier? Go. You're a kind man. Take care. Forgive me, Farug. Forgive? Got it? One of them was killed. We buried him.l know where. One's epileptic and needs treatment. One's called Farug. He's a good... What happened to Emad? His wife's been waiting for him since yesterday. Emad! Don't mention anything to his wife while we're here. Get going, Eesa. Poor girl's waiting. That's why it's very difficult. I have no idea what Emad told you. Still, you don't need to tell her everything word by word. How old did you say you were? Iam 18 18, plus a slap! You said you had a message from Emad, but he used to write. Did he? He wanted to come, but he couldn't. I talked to him on the radio. He didn't sound that way. It wasn't the right time. Those jerks had us under heavy fire. You would've answered the same way if you were in his shoes. What are you hiding from me? Me? Nothing. What did he say exactly when you last saw him? He asked me to tell you he's served his share of the war and he's intending to return. That he's ashamed of you and doesn't want to be ashamed any more. He said he'd be back for good once the offensive was over, and wanted to go abroad to continue his studies. Are you telling the truth? He said he'd served his share of the war...l said that before! - Your name's Eesa, right? - Yes. Eesa. I'd come here to make him happy, but he beat me to it. Goodbye. Eesa! You told me the truth? That's what he told me. Eesa! Are you going to return to Emad? God willing. Emad used to write to me anytime he couldn't come. Perhaps, as he wanted to come back... Did you tell me the truth? I told you everything. Then do me a favour and take this to him. It's his tape! - Eesa! - I'm here. We have to return... What's this? So far I wondered who'll respond to a lonely wife. Then? Now I'm wondering who'll respond to her child! [ The end ] Subtitles and DVD Authoring: Persian Arts Institute, Tehran
