[MUSIC PLAYING] ALEX (VOICEOVER): My name is Alex Preston. No, that's not my real name. But then most people I know have several names. Their given one, their phony ones, stage names, the aliases. Some people I know, the list of different names is long as their arm. These are used for whatever is convenient at the time. Like a lot of people have different bank accounts under different names, and then there are the jokers who changed their identities so many times that they're not quite sure who they are. This story is about such a guy. A guy I work for, which is why I'm here in Mexico, looking for a runaway wife in Mazatlán. And the husband doesn't know what his name is, or who he is. As far as I can figure it out, everybody's lying-- lying without compunction to get their own way. The husband is rich and possessive, the wife is a striking beauty. I'm a freelancer, and an adventurer. Right now, I'll do anything for a buck, or a lot of bucks. I've been a merchant marine, a salesman, a Vegas shill, an agent, private detective-- what else? It's hot here, but where this all started was very cold. Just a little too slow. Sucker. CHRISTINA: Did you see that? I saw the same thing you did. We gotta get him to a doctor! What are we doing to do? Carry him down? No use getting a doctor. It's too late. How bad are you? He's been after me for a long time. Who? I know his secrets, and I know his past. He's worth a lot of money, till somebody exposes him. Who? Expose who? Now listen to me. He'll pay you plenty of money. Just do what I say. What's his name? Please, do what I tell you. This will be my revenge. Tell him you know everything from me-- how he got his money, and who he screwed around for his own personal gain. He'll pay you a lot of money. He had someone kill me. Make him pay. Tell him you know his secret. Who is he? Nazarin. Anthony Nazarin. Anthony Nazarin. Do you know who he's talking about? Sure. He's a multimillionaire, like Howard Hughes. [COUGHS] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Alex? ALEX: Hello. Hi. What about the police? They took the bodies down. They questioned me about everything. I made you a drink. I was supposed to buy you a drink. CHRISTINA: No sweat. Hey, I could use one after this day. CHRISTINA: Here you go. To us. Christina, I hardly even know you. I'm real easy to get to know. Anyway, this Alfonso guy said the secret Nazarin was worth a lot of money. But how can that be worth any money? It depends on to what extent we expose him. Oh, we know nothing about him. Not right now, we don't. But we will. Well, I hate to learn, but I would love to know. Yeah? Well, maybe there'll be something in this for both of us. I'll work with ya, as long as I know I won't get hurt. Promise you, you won't get hurt. How's your martini? It's all right. How's yours? So what do you do? I'm a dancer. What's your business? I was a private investigator. I even went to school for it. What do you mean, was? Well, I had some trouble with the FBI. I take no shit from anybody, so I walked away. Are you married? Oh, still paying for the last one. You? I haven't found anyone good enough for me. High self-esteem, huh? Yeah. I can respect those goals. Men are stupid. They do stupid things. How's that? They're here to protect women, not to abuse them. I totally agree. You know, Alex, I'm very easy to get to know. I'm not one of your average snow bunnies, and I do have a heart. Oh, yeah? Where's it at? Right here. Ooh. Would you like to feel it beating? Soft and strong. How's your martini? Dry. How's yours? Wet. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HEAVY BREATHING] [MOANING] Oh, yeah! [STRONG WINDS BLOWING] Anthony Nazarin is very rich. Probably worth $100 million. Works in the commodities market. All on computer, buys and sells minerals, lumber, and steel, things like that. He sells them all over the world. He's very well-connected. He's very secretive and possessive. How's that? DIRK: He's a ruthless businessman, and will let nothing stand in his way about anything. Business or pleasure. So what's this guy like? I don't know. I've never met him, but I hear he's a real prick. ALEX: Does he throw a lot of parties? Plenty of parties, but nobody close to him, except his wife. He's got a wife, huh? Great looking, and smart. I hear she's packing it in. Maybe you could get to her. Maybe. Anyway Dirk, like I was telling you, the guy skiing down the mountain who got stabbed in the back-- he told me something when he was dying in my arms about this guy Nazarin. He told me that he had some secrets in his past that exposed the proper person with a lot of money. Blackmail is messy. It's not exactly blackmail. DIRK: So what would you call it Information for sale. He'll squash you. Not necessarily. It depends on how much I find out. What makes you so sure that you're not going to end up like this guy in the snow? I don't know the answer to that, but I'm sure going to find out. You feeling lucky? Maybe. Nazarin is in San Francisco right now. Perfect. I've tracked down Christina, the girl who witnessed the murder with me in Utah. She's up in San Francisco, and I can't wait to see her. Are you falling in love? Come on, Dirk. You know me, I'm always in love. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HORN HONKING] I thought I'd find you here. How's that? Faith. Why'd you walk out on me? I had a plane to catch, and I hate goodbyes. I found you, you didn't find me. Same difference. Did you find anything else out about Nazarin? I found out a little, but obviously you did. I'm working. And, uh, what else? A lot of questions today, aren't we? I'm a curious guy. When are we going get together with this guy on Nazarin? Uh, what do you mean "we?" Don't you remember? We found Alfonso together. And it doesn't make us partners. So we both heard the same story, but it could be true, or it could be a lie. If you thought it was a lie, you wouldn't be here. I'm dancing! Yeah, the Bolshoi Ballet? No, I'm stripping at a club in North Beach. Yeah, I saw the ad in the "San Francisco Chronicle." Well, why don't you stop by? Where you going? Nails. - Hmm. - Bye. Oh, well. Hey, buddy! You didn't pay for the oysters. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MEN CLAPPING AND CHEERING] [WHISTLING] CHRISTINA: Hey. Hey. So how do you like it so far? I'm impressed. You're a terrific dancer. Some people consider it an art form. Listen, you said you'd work with me as long as you didn't get hurt. I am way ahead of you. How's that? Anthony Nazarin is having one of his private parties, and I've scored an invitation. Oh, really? Well, how private is it? You can come, but we got to get our story straight if we tell him that we know the secret of his past. That's all we need to say. That's what we use for bait. But what's the backup? We don't need a backup yet. We just need to get close to him. Well, the party's tonight, late. I get off at 11. Pick me up. All right. Can I buy you a drink? Sure. And by the way, you're a good fuck. You're a good fuck too. Mm. I know. [APPLAUSE] That must be him. Let's go say hello. Let's go. That's the man. Come on. [LAUGHTER] Thanks, Mr. Nazarin, for inviting me. I'm Christina, Lila's friend from the club. And I'm Alex, her friend. Uh, I came along-- I hope that's OK. Alex Preston. Well, thanks for inviting us. It seems like everybody is enjoying themselves tonight. Yeah, it's great to meet you. I've heard so much about you. That must be his wife. Well, soon-to-be ex-wife. They're getting a divorce. Or, she's getting a divorce. That's what my friend Lila told me. She's very attractive. Stop staring at her. Look at her, and look at him! Cold bastard. Wouldn't even say hello to me or shake my hand. He probably doesn't like strangers. Not for long. I gotta speak to him about, uh, Alfonso. [INAUDIBLE] Can you get me a drink? I'm gonna go take a look around the house. Don't be too long. I won't. Are you here to join in on the fun? Wh-- wh-- wha-- what fun? [INAUDIBLE]. [MOANING] Yes! Yeah, that's it, baby. Yeah. Yes! [LAUGHTER] Excuse me, my name is Alex. Are you Mrs. Nazarin? I used to be. I'm getting a divorce. But still friendly. I am. Carina. Are you an acquaintance of my soon-to-be ex-husband? Well, we barely spoke. If he likes you, he'll try to control your life, like his companies. You sound unhappy. Disappointed. So, uh, [INAUDIBLE] Oh, I wouldn't say that. I'd like you to tell your husband something for me. I know all about him and his past, and what he's done to get to where he's at. He's even had people murdered. I know about that too. You must know him better than I do. I know about him, and I know his secret. Well, he has lots of secrets. Which one do you know? Ever heard of a guy named Alfonso? No. Your boyfriend is annoying my wife. Oh, he's not my boyfriend. He's still annoying my wife. Get him out of here. Um, Mr. Nazarin, I just want to-- Would you get him out of here before I have him removed? It could get pretty ugly. We're leaving. Uh, next time, come alone. Sorry. Oh, no, that's quite OK. I'm-- I'm sure you, uh, weren't aware that you were with a scumbag. Well you really screwed that up! Talk to anybody but his wife! I was just talking to her! He's extremely jealous! How do you know that? She's divorcing him and he does not like it! He wouldn't like anyone leaving him! This guy likes to own everything around him. He's doing pretty good! Not really. He's drowning her, he's possessive of her-- Aren't we getting a little sidetracked? It's Nazarin we're looking for. You know what? I had to go through his wife to get to him! The prick wouldn't talk to me at the party! Well, you know what? I talked to Carina. Told her everything I knew about his past, and also asked her if she knew about Alfonso. - Well, did she? - No! That's OK. I guarantee you she tells him about it. So, uh, what are you doing later? What are you doing right now? I'm going home, alone. Hey! Christina! Christina! It was a very nice birthday party, Anthony, but I've got to go. Sit down. I'm not staying. This is nothing new to you. You know my feelings about this. Feelings? Carina, I love you. You say you love me, but you don't give me any freedom for myself. You have all the freedom you want. All you care about is money. You just want to own things. Well, I don't want to be owned. There are some things that I've been wanting to talk to you about. Some things that have been on my mind. Some changes that I've wanted to make. It's too late for changes. I want the divorce. I don't want to hear about this. I want to leave. In time, you will feel differently, and you will be glad that I stopped you. It's not going to work anymore between you and me. You expect me to let you, uh, leave? You don't need me, but I need me. What you are asking is an impossibility. [SIGHS] I am never going to let you go. I love you more than anything. Do you know how many men have said that? How many times? In time, you'll forget all about me, and that you ever said that. You mean more to me than anything. Except yourself. Who was this man that was here tonight-- Alex? What about him? He seems to know a lot about your past. Some secret? He's a liar. And who is a man called Alfonso? Know anything about him. Well you're a very smart guy who doesn't seem to know very much. No. You can't deny the electricity between us. I want to go, Anthony. May I touch you? No. If I am guilty of anything, it's that I am selfish. It's not going to happen. What you really like is the way that I make love to you. I hate you. I know. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [EVIL CHUCKLE] [TYPING] Sure I can find him. When do you want to see him? ANTHONY (ON PHONE): As soon as possible. It's important. Sure, no problem. [DIAL TONE] ALEX: You're late. CHRISTINA: Fashionably. ALEX: I hate a woman who's late. CHRISTINA: Then go to another planet. ALEX: You know, I knew he'd want to talk to us. You know, this guy doesn't want anyone to have anything on him. But what do we have on him? Not much. We're mostly bluffing. But when we tell him about Alfonso, he's gonna want to give us some hush money, and that's going to be it. I think you underestimate Mr. Nazarin. It's not going to be that easy. Let me handle it, all right? Where'd you get this stuff? In the computer. Don't you have a computer, Mr. Preston? Or, is that Mr. Pringle? It's Preston now. That's quite a list of, shall we say, accomplishments there-- from all the time you spent with the FBI. And you did get yourself in some trouble, didn't you? [TSK NOISES WITH TONGUE] I do what I want to do. I don't take shit from anybody. What is that? His past. His record. His achievements, his failures, his mistakes. Anybody find out about this stuff? The internet is world wide, Mr. Pringle. Excuse me, Mr. Preston. Well, Nazarin, uh, what does a computer have to say about you? I'm not on a computer. I have got a clean slate. Well maybe we have some information the computer doesn't have. And what would that be, hmm? Why should we tell you? 'Cause you want some money. You want to sell me some information, but you don't have any. Christina and I were skiing down this mountain slope when a man was murdered. He got a knife in his back. So? He worked for you. His name was Alfonso. Is that true, Christina? Huh? Yes. He died right in front of us, and he mentioned your name. And he told us everything about you. No, I don't think so. Fine. Maybe this information will be more useful to somebody else, like Interpol. I don't believe you. No, I don't think I'm going to buy any information from you, because you don't have any information to sell. But, uh, I've got a proposition for you. I am going to give you something to sell, and then I will buy it back from you. What are you talking about? Why don't you and I go on upstairs and have a little talk, OK? You will excuse us, Christina? CHRISTINA: Yeah. How old do you, uh, think I am? I don't know. Well, I don't know how old I am, because I don't know who I am. What are you talking about? You don't know anything about me, because I don't know anything about me. You're Anthony Nazarin. Eight years ago, I, uh, woke up in a dive motel in San Pedro. All I had was the suit I was sleeping in. In the suit was $200,000. Anything before that, I plain don't remember. I suppose you want me to find out all about your past. Look, I am up for a very important government contract. But before they'll make that deal, they want to find out everything they possibly can. You can move around on the underground. Find out what you can, make an investigation, and report back to me. So, uh, I take it that if I can't find out anything, the government won't be able to either. I'll pay you. I'll pay you $100,000. What do I have to go on? You told my wife you knew all about my past. Maybe you killed someone for the money. Or maybe you stole it! Here's, uh, a little expense money. Find out what you can. I told you, I know the very best divorce lawyers in town. Yeah, your lawyer. Why can't I do something on my own? I can take myself to a lawyer. We have the car, we have the driver, and I'm headed downtown anyway. It's your lawyer! You're never going to let me get this divorce. You just want to drag this on as long as possible. I don't want to argue with you about this. Then let me go. You know, you are making this very, very difficult for me. I'll make it easy. Stop the car! Carina! Carina! [HORN HONKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] I've got to leave. Some people in LA seem to remember a man fitting Nazarin's description hanging around with this woman named Solana. Gypsy-type. She ran a gang that delved in everything from smuggling to fencing-- all illegal. CHRISTINA (ON PHONE): Where are you? I'm in LA. I found a distant third cousin, second wife, something like that-- of Solana's. She works in a video store. I'm on my way there right now. Hey, Christina, don't forget-- you're gonna get a nice chunk of this in the end. CHRISTINA (ON PHONE): If you find anything. [MUSIC PLAYING] CARLA: Can I help you, mister? Oh, yeah. Um, are you Carla? Who wants to know? My name's Alex. Nice jacket, by the way. Thank you. I'm looking for somebody. Well I'm somebody. I'm sure you are, but I'm looking for a woman named Solana. Solana Slovinski Um, do you know her? I've heard of her. What do you want with her? Uh, it's an insurance matter. You don't look like an insurance man. Well, let's say I represent insurance. I'm Carla. I don't know Solana, but she's a relative of mine. An aunt, or a cousin, or something. She was married to my dad's cousin. Well, do you know where I could find him? I don't know. I've never even met her. Do you know someone that may know where I can find her? I might know a little something that could help you. Well, what is it, Carla? Well, that information doesn't come free, Alex. I'm willing to pay. Oh, just a minute. Who'd you fuck last? What do you mean who'd I fuck last? Why? I just want to know if you're clean. Yeah, I'm clean. What do you want? I want you to fuck me. I want you to fuck my brains out. Well, uh, right. This only happens in the movies. Well, we are in a video store. Isn't that close enough? Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. I'm coming onto you. Got it? Yeah, I get it. You do want the information, don't you? Of course I want the information. I want you to take me in the back and come fuck me. You got it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [INAUDIBLE] Huh? I want you to feel this shit. What do you got for me? Solana's ex-husband knows where she is. He works in a video warehouse in Van Nuys. Here's his address. Go talk to him. Van Nuys, huh? See you around. Have a good day. ALEX: Excuse me! We don't sell videos in here, bud. This is just a warehouse. I'm not here to buy videos, I'm just here to ask you some questions. What about? About a girl named Solana. You, uh, are Thomas, aren't you? You're not a cop, are you? Do I look like a cop? Hell, you never know anymore. Cops look like bums and hippies. You never know. Well, I'm not a cop. I'm just trying to locate Solana. She's not here. Well, I didn't think she was. But do you know where I can find her? What do you want her for? I just want to ask her some questions about somebody. A guy named Anthony Nazarin. Do you know him? I don't know him. He's a rich guy, though, isn't he? Yes he is. Do you happen to know if him and Solana were together? You know, I don't know. I was married to her, but that was a long, long time ago. She was real young back then. Hell, for all I know, I'm still married to her. I never did get any divorce papers. She just ran off one day. Do you know where she might be at? I heard something. What'd you hear? You're going to pay me for this, aren't you? Mexico. Mexico's a big place. Mazatlán. She's in Mazatlán. That's what I heard. But don't tell anybody I told you. Gonna say anything to anybody. You know, I'm legit now. I'm trying to go straight. I'm in show business. How is the video business? It's paying the bills. Thanks for the info, buddy. Hey, don't tell anybody you saw me, OK? [MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [HORN HONKING] Christina, it's Alex again. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK. Nazarin just had someone try to run me off the road. I'm all right. This might be getting too dangerous. He's asked me to join him on his yacht for a party. I'd better not go. It'll be suspicious if you don't go. Besides, maybe you can learn something by getting close to him. I'm taking a little trip myself, out of the country for a few days. Oh, where are you going? Tell you that when I get back. Just be cool, and find out whatever you can. Oh, what are we getting ourself into, Alex? A lot of money, I hope. You told me I wouldn't get hurt. If you have any intuition about trouble, don't go out on the yacht. Well, I guess it's OK. I mean, it's only a party. I can take care of myself. ALEX (ON PHONE): Maybe so. Just be careful. I hear ice cubes. I'm having a good stiff drink before I leave. Well have one for me. I'll see you when I get back. CHRISTINA (ON PHONE): Good luck, Alex. Thanks. [TIRES SCREECHING] You know, I just took a walk around your boat, and I didn't see anybody. I thought this was a party. Well, it seems as if no one else was able to make it. Just you and I. Gives us an opportunity to get to know each other better. Um, I think I could use another drink. Shall we go below? Sure. Thank you. Can you put a little more [INAUDIBLE] in my glass? Why not? I'm-- I'm not an ungenerous man. I'll bet not. Here. And, uh, relax. I'm relaxed, all right. There's nothing to do out here. Well, you are a very beautiful woman. Thanks. I keep myself in shape dancing. Bet you make a lot of money, don't you? Mm. Probably have everything you want. What else do you want? More. I always want just a little more. Hey, where's your wife? I didn't see her around. Where is she? Gone. She, uh, left me. Well there's something you don't have. Yeah. Whoa. Gosh, is it the booze or the boat? Well, occasionally boats rock back and forth. Side to side. Up and down. In and out. So, uh, tell me. What happened with you and Alex up there on the mountain? What exactly did Alfonso say? Let's not talk about that again. He hardly said anything. But, uh, what exactly did he say, hmm? He said your name-- Anthony Nazarin. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] Oh, you scared me! What is that? What are you doing? You're scaring me! [SCREAM] [SPLASH] ALEX (ON PHONE): Who is it? Nazarin. Is this Alex? ALEX (ON PHONE): Yeah. I'm in my car. I hope I don't cut out on you. What, you call me if I was alive? I called to see, uh, how you were doing. ALEX (ON PHONE): Yeah. I ditched the tail you put on me. Why don't you leave me alone and let me do my job? Did you, uh, find out anything? ALEX (ON PHONE): You'll know everything when I complete my report. I called about something else. ALEX (ON PHONE): What is it now? I want you to stop what you're doing, and go pick up my wife. Bring her back to me. ALEX (ON PHONE): Why should I do that? [SIGHS] I'll give you some extra money. ALEX (ON PHONE): Where do I pick her up? Mexico. Mazatlán. ALEX (ON PHONE): How do you know? She's been drawing money from her, uh, trust fund, and my bank traced her to Mazatlán. I, uh, don't have an address for her, but she's there. ALEX (ON PHONE): Why don't you go down there and get her yourself? She won't come back with me. She ran away. Just bring her back to me. ALEX (ON PHONE): How much? 5,000. ALEX (ON PHONE): Make it 10 and I'm on my way. OK. 10. You need any money now? ALEX (ON PHONE): I'm OK. I can always wire you for more. Come back right away. ALEX (ON PHONE): As soon as I can, boss. That is not funny, Alex. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me! Excuse me! I met you at a party. Oh, really? And? In San Francisco, at your house. I wanted to send a message to your husband. What message? That I knew all about his past. I guess I remember you. I guess I didn't make too good of an impression, did I? I remember you. You a hustler? No, I'm here on business. For my husband? No, I'm an independent contractor. Does that mean you build things or tear them down? Hey, can I buy you a drink? - No. - Maybe later? I-- I'll come by your place. Where are you staying here? Look, I came to Mexico to be alone, OK? Leave me alone. I just don't know anywhere here, and you're a fellow American. There are no fellow Americans. [INAUDIBLE] Amigo, do you know a woman here in Mazatlán by the name of Solana? Señor, I know a lot of women. She's a gypsy type. Strong woman. What did you say her name was? Solana. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I understand, I understand. Where can I find her? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Muchos gracias, amigo. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] So, you going down to the shop today? No. I don't feel like doing anything today. Your passion is as strong as it ever was. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] You expecting somebody? No. You gonna see who it is? No. I'll see who it is. It's probably someone selling something. Yes? ALEX: I'd like to speak to a woman name Solana. Solana's not expecting anyone, and I don't know you, so-- I know you don't. My name is Alex Preston. I'm from Los Angeles. I'll tell you what. Why don't you write her a letter, tell her what it's all about. I don't have time to send her a letter. I just met her ex-husband, Thomas, in Los Angeles. I need to speak to her. Wait a minute. I'm Solana. Why did Thomas send you here? He didn't. I came on my own. I had to talk to you. About? Can I come inside? I don't want to talk in a doorway. It's up to you. Let him in. We'll have coffee on the terrace. So, my ex-husband. How is he? He's in the video business. The video business? Oh, there's a lot of money in the video business. I hope he's doing well. Just great. Although, he seems a little confused. He thinks he's still married to you. He never got his divorce papers. Oh, he got them. He lost them. Poor fool. I'm sorry, what was your name again? Alex. Alex Preston. Alex, this is my husband, Max. Nice to meet you. So what do you want? I'm doing an investigation. About me? No. About Anthony Nazarin. What about him? Well, it seems he doesn't remember anything about his past. Eight years ago, he woke up in a hotel room with $200,000 in cash in his pocket. He doesn't remember how he got there, nor does he remember how the money got there. He's a liar. If he's a liar, then why did he hire me to uncover his past? Did you know a man named Alfonso? He worked for me, just like Nazarin. Only Nazarin wasn't his real name. It was Tony Nahas. I had a few boys working for me, it was more than eight years ago. And the business we were in was a little shady, you know. So that really isn't even his name? He made it up? Tony was stubborn. He didn't like to take orders from anyone, including me. He wanted to be his own man, and that's what he did. So where'd the $200,000 in cash come from? He stole it from me. And you didn't do anything about it? It was drug money, and we had a lot of it lying around in those days. It didn't mean anything. But that's a lot of money. It was more than that. I was crazy about him. He was my lover. But he built an empire on that dirty money. Do you know what that information is worth? You could blackmail him. Is that what you're planning to do? No, I work for him. But you could get your cash back from him. I don't care. I really don't care. I don't give a fuck about him. I'm legit now. I own a shop, I have Max, and I have Mexico. Nazarin had someone kill Alfonso. Are you sure about that? Pretty sure. He's trying to eliminate anyone connected with his past. Does that mean me too? I don't know. I would suggest that you shut your mouth and close your investigation. You see, he's got this big government contract coming up. He's trying to make sure there's no one around his past that's going to implicate him in anything crooked. If what you're telling me, Mr. Preston, is true, and you know everything about Nazarin, I'd say your life's in danger too. He'll get rid of you next, Mr. Preston. You can leave now. Well, thank you for the information. May I join you? Are you following me? No, I'm not following you. But I am trying to hook up with you. Didn't you understand me when I said I wanted to be left alone? Yeah, I did, but I can't do that. I gotta talk to you. I didn't ask you to join me. Listen, I'm going to cut through the crap. Your husband hired me to come down here and look for you and bring you back. You can forget that. I'm not going back. If it's not me, it's going to be somebody else. Did you tell him you found me? No, I haven't spoke to him. You're getting paid and pretty well, aren't you? I'm beginning to wonder if this is all worth it. Look, Nazarin may pay you, but it's going to end up costing you something. Be ready for that. Yeah. You know what? I'm getting tired of this game. 'Cause in the long run, you're going to probably go back to him, and I'm going to end up with nothing. So fuck him, fuck you! Never found out where I live, did you? No. CARINA: I don't think anybody could. Don't leave without saying goodbye. Hey! Take the highway out of town to [INAUDIBLE] 13. You see a railroad crossing, make a right turn. It's a dirt road. Just follow it to the end. Adios. [LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE] You were right. No one would find you here. Want a drink? Sure. Tequila OK? Absolutely. There's no ice. So, no electricity here, huh? No. Everything's natural. My house is up over the dune there, but I like it here. It's really nice. Beautiful. How'd you ever end up with Nazarin? He told me I was his good luck charm. He was rich. He was good to me. How'd he ever have any time for you? He did, in the beginning. He made time. He wanted me more than anything. Except money. I wanted him too. He made me believe in myself. I was going through a down period. I tried suicide. Why? I'm not sure why. I wasn't happy, and I didn't want to live. He rescued me. So whatever went wrong? Anthony is the kind of person who will do anything to get what he wants, and anything to keep what he wants. Salud. Well, I guess I'd better get going. Why? What'd you come here for? [ROMANTIC JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Your husband's been calling my room. I haven't returned his calls. What do you want to do? We have to go back and face him together. That's the worst thing we could do. We should just stay here in Mexico. We're in trouble wherever we go, unless we have a showdown with him. I like it here with you. Nazarin hired me to do a job besides find you. He hired me to uncover his past. Did you? Yeah. I found out where he got his money to get started, and I found the only people in his past. Have you told him yet? No. We got a lot of money coming to me when I turn in my report. He'll screw you out of it. Don't be afraid. I love you. I've been afraid all my life. It's so hard for me to trust anyone. I'm not anyone. I know. I know. I want to trust you. I love you. We're gonna go back, and we're gonna end this. What the hell are you doing in Mexico? I work for Nazarin. He has me working on a couple of assignments. Then you didn't hear about Christina? Something wrong? She's dead. Her body was found washed up on the rocks underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. She was on a boat with Nazarin. The paper said it was an accident. Bullshit! I'll be in touch. What happened to Christina out on the boat? There was an accident. She fell overboard. How convenient. An accident. I want to thank you for bringing my wife back, and I will arrange for your money. Christina didn't know a thing. Why'd she have to die? Something frightened her. Here, take your report. I found Solana down in Mexico. Seems that she's the only one alive that knows anything about your past. You were in a gang that she masterminded years ago. You stole $200,000 from her. As far as I can tell, she was the last one left alive. Oh, wait-- except for Alfonso. But he's gone now. You know what else? Solana didn't give a fuck about you. Well, I had to make sure that no one could implicate me. Why? Because of your government contract? Because of your reputation? She's down in Mexico. Call her if you don't believe me. Give me the phone. There's no use in calling Mexico. CARINA: Did you kill them too? I didn't kill anybody. So here we are. We know everything about your past. Good luck in the future-- If you have one. Come on. Carina, where are you going? I'm sick of you running my life the way you want it. I'm going with Alex. You're not going anywhere. You don't own me, Anthony. Can't you get that through your head? You don't fucking own me. Get your hands off of her. You're even crazier than I thought you were. Alex, I am going to give you a gift-- your life. You get your hands off of her, you go out that door, and you keep on walking, and I will let you live. I promise. I want to go with him. You get your hands off of her! [MEN PUNCHING EACH OTHER] Alex! [GUNSHOT] I really, really did love you. ALEX: Somebody would find the body sooner or later, if anyone cared. I didn't get all the money I went after, but I got more. I got Carina. And maybe it'll last-- eh, maybe it won't. As soon as the estate is settled, we'll probably go away, take a little trip. Probably Mexico. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) The night spoke of you, the pieces all in place. So many stones unturned, still just another place. Love was so [INAUDIBLE] another restless heart, trying to surrender with not knowing where to start. So many roads headed for destiny. So hard to choose when darkness hides what you can't see. You crossed the miles, [INAUDIBLE] you rescued me and took my heart. And you crossed the miles. And you made the plan. You set me free. [INAUDIBLE] The dark and stormy sky still lingers in the air. And the raging water is high. The passion of--
