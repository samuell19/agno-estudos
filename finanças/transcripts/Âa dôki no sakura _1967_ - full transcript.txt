Because of this, on September 23, the Japanese government issued an emergency decree , abolishing any exemption from military duty. About 100,000 students with humanitarian professions had been forced to interrupt their studies and prepare for deployment. On October 21, under dank autumn rains a muster of student sections was held in the Meiji Jingo stadium. This path will lead to the front. In these troubled times no one can be a bystander. You, brave young men, left your student days behind you to go to the battlefield. Following the example of our ancestors, you will defend your homeland. You must prevent the destruction of our country. Good luck to you all in this war. Today, I have a request for you. The war began with clashes with the Chinese, and further... When can you go back to school? I only think about that. Let me die, I don't want my fate to depend only on my determination and courage. DECEMBER 10, 1943, NAVY BASE IN MAIZURU Of the drafted students, 13,000 young men were stationed at separate bases around Japan at the lowest rank of crewman. I already said how it would look like when students are dressed in a naval uniform but in general it suits you. So, now it seems like you look a little bit like sailors. Yes. - Louder! - Yes! Despite the fact that Japan is in a serious situation and is fighting hard, you have shied away for two or three years from military service and lived your civilian life. And so what? You had a good time. But from now on everything will change! Apparently, after a short period of training you will be promoted from crewmen second class to officers of the student reserves. But don't think that you all will be promoted! Is that clear? You are all just common peasants. Don't think that we will make it easy for you, just because you're students! - Hey you, with the glasses! - Aye! - What's your name? - Shinishi Fukushima. -Wrong. I'm Shinichi Fukushima. Wrong! Crewman second class Shinichi Fukushima That's it. In the future you will answer in this manner. You think that if you wear glasses, you're the smartest? It only means that in the civilian world you read too many books. How do you wear your peak-less cap? Put it on properly! Yes, sir! Fool! Now listen! From now on we will get rid of all of your lousy civilian habits! About face! About face! That's it! Hurry up! Do it! Do it well! Brat! Do it right! Don't raise your heads! Move! Slackers! Hey, you! What are you doing? Get a hold of yourself! Don't be lazy! How are you? I can't even sit down properly! I'm most comfortable on the toilet. Why? There, I can think alone quietly. I don't even want to think about anything anymore. I just want to become an officer as quickly as possible. Fukushima! Enough already! This isn't your civilian world! Hanazawa... Fear not! I have good news for you. They say that soon we will be allowed to receive visitors. Brother! Brother! Mother and father are here. What is it, why are you crying? Because... Because his hands are covered in calluses. Don't baby him. And you call yourself a teacher's wife? You don't know how to be a mother. Stop. We're not here to quarrel. You can swear whatever you want, at least this reminds me of home. You see? He talks like a grown man. Tatsuya...you're all grown up. Well, I don't know. I wouldn't say that. Try to become a real man. It'll be better if you got married! It's not easy now! All the guys have been sent to war. What? Can't some guy be found here for me? Reiko, we didn't come here to find a groom for you. I brought you something to eat. You can't! We aren't allowed to eat during the visits. But they eat everything here. Look! You shouldn't gulp it down like that! Your parents didn't come? It would have been difficult for them to come back from the dead. What? I already parted ways with them a long time ago. I didn't know. It's not important anymore. I just wanted to breath some non-military air. Hey, Reiko. Reiko! Three relatives have come for me. I'll let you have my sister. No, thanks. Given him enough civilian air to breathe. - Brother... - Please. Very nice to meet you. I'm Reiko. I'm Hanazawa. Look. Want to try it? Sweet rice balls. I've prepared them myself. They look good! Brother didn't want to eat them. What a pity! You made them for nothing. Okay then... - These are great. - Take another one. I'll take another. What is this! Moron! You aren't the only one! Have you forgotten that you aren't allowed to eat or drink here? Visiting time is over! All the new recruits back to the barracks! Hanazawa, sir... Hanazawa, don't be disappointed! C'mon! That's nonsense! I'm sorry. Don't apologize. At least I had something wonderful to eat. Thank you very much, Reiko-san. Tatsuya! This is your medicine. I'll send you more each month. Keep an eye on your health. Tonight, we will be leaving Maizuru. I'll go with you. Fukushima. I knew... that with such poor vision I couldn't become a pilot. Our objective is still the same. It's war after all. When you finish washing these containers, you will come to me! Shiratori. He even wants to train us on the last night. FEBRUARY 1, 1944, TSUCHIURA NAVAL AIR STATION 3,200 young men, selected from all parts of the fleet were assigned to flight training. The ground staff was located in Kogashima. And the pilots in Tsuchiura. We have been waiting for you. Where have you been all this time? Your spirit can't be as pampered as that of a ground soldier! You should be proud of the fact that you're naval officers. Only a fleet officer is this elegant, brilliant and courageous! When I look at you, you all look very young. You each have a strong body. Chances are that you're not stupid. In other words, you are first class stallions of the Japanese nation. Quiet... I'll be straight with you. You all will have to die. In the South Pacific our enemy began furiously counterattacking us. Unfortunately, our country's industry is lagging behind. You can only hit the enemy with your determination to sacrifice... your life in combat. Is that clear? From tomorrow on, start your training with pride for the Japanese people and the resolve to fight until the end. Clear? Do it properly! Fight! For real! If you die, then at least die as heroes. Harder! Harder! Jackass! Get up! Go on! Only forward! If you die, then as heroes! Up! Climb up! Come on, what are you doing there, you fool! Climb up already! Come on! Damn! - Commander! - Yes. The entire fifteenth squadron is not allowed to fly from now on. Listen! What does today's failure mean? You haven't tried at all! Have you forgotten about battle determination, of which our commander spoke? No such luck. And you bragged about wearing an officer's uniform. Hanazawa! What? Yui! As for the two of you, have you even tried? We will teach you how to be true students. Come here! Wait! The ones that were defending are also responsible for us losing. Why do you want to hit your friends? We were all university students. Shut up! You talk like a civilian! You come here too! Wait! You'll do nothing without the authorization of the person on duty! All right then. I'm asking your permission. Fuwa! Resolve isn't the only thing pilots need for fighting. Student Yui, can you tell me what the message was? Everyone died. Student Nanjo has arrived. Come here. Who is this 'Noriko'? My wife. You're married? - It doesn't say so in you file. - True. If it's not official, then she's not your wife. It says here: Yesterday the comarum blossomed. What does that mean? I have a son! What? A daughter would have been the peach tree flowering. That is what I agreed with my wife. A secret code? And in addition her father has given his consent. You trying to outsmart the censor? No! It doesn't matter. The commander was right. At least one real stallion can be found amongst you. Wait! Don't you dare let your wife and son be ashamed of you! I know that, from the moment I arrived in this unit. Alright! Student Nanjo, allow me to leave! Next! Student Hanazawa has arrived! Come closer. Reiko Shiratori? Yes. - Stop smiling! - Yes, sir! How do you know her? During a visit, she gave me sweet rice balls. - I'm asking how are you together? - Just friends. This long letter would suggest otherwise. Tell her it can contain a maximum of five lines, each line no more than ten words. Only seasonal greetings are allowed to be more. Yes, sir! End of barracks check! The ashtrays are outside. Tomorrow's sessions will be held precisely on schedule. Everyone must die...Fighting spirit... Do they really believe they can win the war this way? Japan is making a mistake. Yui! I thought... that at least in the Navy they had more rational thinking. But the Japanese fighting spirit... Shiratori! Do you seriously believe that? This war will be won by material superiority. The real forces in the war are the political and economic powers of the country. In this regard, today's Japan is too weak. To hell with their sacrifice and martyrdom. What's wrong? A military uniform doesn't suit you. Not at all. - Shiratori! - Taki, is that you? Do you have a cigarette? This war is complete crap. If I die, the Japanese culture will lag behind more than 50 years. - Where were you going? - Izumi. - Me too! - Great! Yes, I'm here. Hey, is everything clear! To the same place! I am going to become a fighter pilot. If you have to fly, it's best that you only have to worry about yourself. Yui! We will go to Tokushima together. I'm glad that I will become a scout. When doing a reconnaissance flight we can use our minds better than simple pilots. Many think that I'm not suited for that. Hanazawa! This time we will part. - Where are you going? - Izumi. Attention! Today, Student Taki fled from a neighboring company. You want to become an officer and then calmly desert? It seems that we have to drag you around with a rope around your neck, otherwise you will be distracted by female civilians! First of all, you don't have enough patriotic spirit! I'm not surprised that there are traitors to the nation here. Where is your resolve, at a time when our country is threatened with destruction? If you try to escape, you will not succeed in hiding. Taki was arrested three hours after his escape. You know what you can expect if you try to escape? Court-martial and execution will await you! At this time, the Japanese forces suffered one defeat after another in the Marshall Islands. JUNE, 1944, NAVY AIR STATION ON SOUTHERN KYUSHU Height: 200, horizontal flight. What horizontal flight? Change, change, plan. Pedal! Instruments...Instruments! Lift up your head! Enough! Raise your hands, raise your hands! Do not lower your hands! Shut up! A junior officer cannot be insolent! I'm in charge! Let go! I won't! What are they doing there? This is bad. Really bad. I'd love to save you from having to fly, but I can't. The situation at the front is worsening. You all need to do your duty. Now. - Do you want to fly? - Yes, sir! After hearing your responses, I will be happy to instruct you on the whole flying part. Don't laugh! Such a moment will come! And you won't have to wait long for it. Only one will win. Either the enemy will win or you will become real pilots. We have very little time. To expedite the preparation, from tomorrow on we will start flying in groups. Turn 50 degrees, half a length of interval, the distance is 150 meters. Only Japanese pilots deal with such nonsense, eh? This is what you call flying around here! Jackasses! Stop the chatter during the flight! Turn right! Number three, what's wrong? Shiratori, what is it? Shiratori, are you all right? What, you can't even ride a bicycle? Are things this bad for the Navy? I don't know how to ride a bicycle but I can fly. Don't strain yourself, go to the barracks and rest for a while. - Excuse me... - Yes? - Leave was to be tomorrow? - It has been moved to today. - Where are you from? - From Tokyo. I really wanted to make it. Who did you come for? Nanjo of the third company. - Nanjo? - You know him? We're in the same company. This is your grandson? Yes, my first. - How old is he? When he was born, there was a very strong snowstorm. In February? Exactly, exactly. It was after the New Year. My child was also born at that time. So you also have a child, sailor? Excuse me, but what time does leave end? At four. So we have only one hour left. How much you've grown, eh? When you grow up, the war will be over. You have to grow up quick. Grow up quick. You hold the baby in the right position. I can see that you are a father. Yeah, right. I haven't been a father to my own child yet. I haven't even seen him. - Time's up. - That's too bad. It would have been enough just to see him. Can that be done somehow? Excuse me, have you seen Nanjo from the third company? - You know Nanjo? - No. Maybe... Where is he? Nanjo! Where have you been? Quick, there is no time! Noriko! Look at your son. Here! Who's daddy? Every day, I nurse our son. I have to go... All the best to you. Nanjo! What is more difficult; riding a bicycle or flying a plane? They are equally difficult. I would like to fly with you someday. But today we see each other for the last time. Why? They say that Saipan is in danger. I will fly out there. Commander! The rest I leave to you. Commander, the motor is failing! Pretend I'm not here. Pretend you are flying alone. Yes, sir! Leave it to me. Make yourself wide. Place the pillow to your belly. Properly tighten your belt! Report speed and altitude. 60 knots, height 600. 60 knots, height 550. 60 knots, height 500. 60 knots, height 400. 55 knots, height 300. Height 250. Trees on the left! Good, we will hit that tree with our wing. Slow down the plane and land. - Is the pillow on you? - Yes. Take off your goggles! Here we go. Commander! - Are you hurt? - No! If you can't land, do it the same way. - Clear? - Yes, sir! Nothing serious. Don't mind me. I bear full responsibility for today's accident. Commander! Is that clear? Shiratori. Anyone who flies a plane is always on the verge of death. But you don't die like some mangy dog. On July 10th, the entire garrison on the island of Saipan, fell. As a result, Japan lost control of the airspace over the Pacific Ocean. During the heavy fighting, the government of Tojo was dismissed. SEPTEMBER 1944, NAVY AIR STATION IN SOUTHERN KYUSHU - Is that you, Fukushima? - Hi, Shiratori! - How you've progressed! - Just as you did! Now, that will not do. Attention! Everyone listen! The commander of the ground support forces wants to welcome you. His men were called in at the same time as we were. Line up! Line up! Dear pilots, I'm glad to finally get to see all of you. We will not fly any aircraft and that's why our training ended earlier. We will prepare the way ahead of you, toward the sound of battle in the southwest Pacific. I wish you good luck. Thank you! We are touched, really touched. We too wish you much luck in the war! - Salute! - Salute! Let everything go well. We say goodbye! Remove chocks! Remove chocks! In the future, the situation at the front will only worsen. Children are forced to work; everyone worked at manufacturing weapons and increasing the food supplies for the front. People blindly believed the Japanese military leaders' claim that Japan would win. By the beginning of 1945, our frontline students were already promoted to lieutenants. Everybody get up! Line up in front of the beds! Attention! Listen! Our first air squadron conducted a suicide attack in the Philippines. The attack was extremely successful. Pilots with aircraft loaded with explosives crashed at full speed into enemy ships. Lt. Seki and five other pilots named their squadron at the Shinpo attack base squadron 'Sikisima'. It seems that the high command has finally made a decision. Only this way can Japan be spared destruction. Only this way! - Lt. Fuwa! - Yes, sir! Can you do the same? I will also take part in the kamikaze division! Unfortunately, nothing can be done right now, all training flights have been canceled. Commander, why have they been canceled? No fuel. There isn't a single drop of gasoline left for training. This is the end. It's all over for Japan. What are you talking about? Japan doesn't have any oil; we lost the advantage at sea and we can't rely on supplies from the south. This is the end. Shiratori, what will end? Are you saying that Japan will lose? I don't feel that Japan will lose, but I can't imagine how it can win. You idiot! - What is this? - Stop it. Enough, Fuwa! - Stop! - Line up! Hurry up, line up, we have company! Students, how are you conducting yourselves! In the Philippines, the pilots are making suicide attacks, but you are screaming like horses around here! You have no right to wear an officer's uniform! We'll teach you! Line up in two lines! Spread your legs! Clench your teeth! Go! Morons! Stop it! Do you want more? Attention! I see that those who beat, have a lot of enthusiasm, and that those who are beaten also don't just give up. I don't believe medical officers have the right to lecture us, the officers of the military academy. You have too much energy. Do I need to give you a shot so that you can cool down? Are you mocking us? You shouldn't get so angry over so little. You who have completed the military academy, and you, who have come to us from universities, you are the same young people. All of Japan is fighting now. You should know... that most of the land support forces, which left the Usko base, fell in battle as soon as they arrived. Some served on aircraft carriers, others in the air defense of the Philippines. Pray for their souls. Listen! Twenty men under the command of Lt. Yui from the Tokushima airbase reporting to your base. As observers, we will spread ourselves into your crews. This will be a great honor for us! - So, you're glad you're here! - So are we! - Yui! - Hello! During these six months, you have become a different person. It's true. And I was surprised how he has improved himself. And I was by his side the whole time. You and I... are two attached cherries. We blossom in the flower garden. Everything that has blossomed... must one day fall down. Let's fall down together... Look here. ...for our homeland. Hanazawa! You see, eh? When did this happen? Reiko visited me twice in Tokushima. And she calls herself a sister! She never visited me. You know, a brother and a boyfriend are completely different things. Although we aren't close relatives... ...I think we shouldn't be separated. The enemy's next target is Okinawa. Attacks of enemy ships with a lot of firepower can only be countered by special attack tactics, one aircraft diving against one ship. The Tenth Air Squadron decided to focus all their power into this special attack. I order that... Usko Navy Airbase also prepare for the impending battles and immediately begin practicing special attacks. Come in! First Lt. Jinnouchi reporting for duty. As of now, it will be possible to resume flight training. However, it will not be the same training as it was previously. All of you are transferred to different fighting forces. First Lt. Jinnouchi will be your commander. Your task... ...is to become the main force of future suicide attacks. I'm sure that you, the pilots of His Majesty, are fully determined. However, this is not an order. Decide for yourself. Anyone who will go on the special attacks, take a step forward! On March 23rd, a fleet of 1,500 American ships launched a massive attack on Okinawa. The General Staff immediately responded by beginning Operation No. 1. Here! When you arrive at this point, you can finally close your eyes. You can release the stick. The plane will fly on to the target. Alright, open the curtains. You have only one problem. You have to become part of the aircraft. You have to become part of the bomb with 350 kilos of explosives. War is not a game. Forget about the excessive excitement and heroism. Clear? I'll tell you one more thing. You'll just become a tool! - Be attentive on the road. - I will. Talk to your brother about Hanazawa. Mother! Do you know... This is a time when you never know what might happen. No, I'll decide myself about Hanazawa. After all, brother... Hurry up, you must hurry. What is wrong with you? Give regards to Tatsuya for me. To Hanazawa too. Mother! Don't be angry that I've disappointed you. Let's go! Mother, everything is fine! I better run. Where did Hanazawa go? I don't know. Reiko. When he gave me this letter, he was blushing terribly. Read it. What's wrong? Reiko, thank you for the love that you gave me over the past year. However, I consider this letter to be my words of farewell. Looking at your future, I have no right to love you. I lost my parents a long time ago. I know how to be alone. Maybe I'm just a weak-kneed orphan. But I can no longer continue our relationship. No, I don't want to! I don't want to! Reiko. I want to see him! I want to see Hanazawa! I want to see him! It's cruel. It's so cruel. Reiko. Don't you know what kind of choices we had to make? You cowards! You and Hanazawa both! You did this on purpose! No! Brother, it's... He had no right to love you. Didn't Hanazawa himself write exactly that to you? I can't leave my daughter... ...in the hands of a military pilot. I can't give her to you... ...though she wants to marry you. - Finally asleep? - Yes. Kenichi, I hope you know that I'm your father. He's too small for that. He's only a year old. Didn't he smile when he saw me? Beloved... ...don't open the door until I tell you to. Kenichi. Remember my face well. If you don't have time, then you won't remember it. My love... I wanted the ceremony to include only the two of us. The two of us... No one can separate the two of us. Nothing. No one. Not even the war. My love! Lt. Nanjo, Lt. Nanjo! Alert! Alert! Understood. My love! You shouldn't worry. Wait! Noriko! Use it as a scarf. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hello, this is Mrs. Nanjo. This is Shiratori. Nanjo is taking off. Yui, what are you doing here? 26 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, 127 degrees 50 minutes east longitude. I noted this on the map with the crossing of these lines. This is the place where I will die. Just a moment. I wish the time we have left to live was like a strong steel rope. I don't understand you. I don't understand that you are so different than you were in the past. This happened when Taki escaped! I decided to follow my own path. Taki? Where did Taki end up? Forget him already! Yui. You must decide whose side you are on. You've changed. You've become a completely different person. A group of B-29 aircraft are flying from the Kinisaki Peninsula toward this base. Get ready for an air raid! Enemy aircraft overhead! Take cover! To the shelter. Lt. YUI Damnit! This can't be! I'm going to light them on fire! Get out of the way! Attention! Fujii. You studied at a Buddhist Institute. Say some sutra. The diary of Yui is better than my sutra. Shiratori, read something from it. I was born at a critical moment in Japanese history. Darkness was originally predicted for our generation. Only 80 years have passed since the Meiji reforms. Japan, trying to quickly catch up with the Western countries, ended up showing the world its fragility. Japan was in a critical situation. But I, Masumi Yui, am still Masumi Yui. I think the finest thing for me is to go to the lecture hall and a library and study social sciences. I want to go down this road every day. On the road I meet the hostess at a snack bar, the uncle at the antique store, the girl from the coffee shop, the old man at the kiosk. All these people are incredibly important in my life. I just want to live in peace and just devote myself to learning and science. ...if I survive this. ...if I survive this. Yui. You bastard. I understand, Yui. Burn faster! A second air raid was reported. I'll call you by name. If you are alive, then answer. - Lt. Shimada! - Here! - Lt. Okayama! - Here! - Lt. Yasumi! - Here! - Lt. Shiratori! - Here! - Lt. Otsuka! - Here! Lt. Koizumi! Lt. Koizumi! - Lt. Hanazawa! - Here! - Lt. Yamane! - Here! - Lt. Fujii! - Here! These ten men will leave today at 23:30 on the last train to the Kushiro airbase. Just for your information, I will add that this time only the cadet students and graduates of military academies will go. I will lead only 27 pilots personally into battle. Commander! Please allow me to go also. I am determined to die for my country. I'm not planning on being left behind! - Don't rush your death! - But... Consider what I said to be my last words of farewell. The named pilots immediately pack up and we will meet at the main gate at 22:30. - Clear? - Yes, sir! Attention! Finally something for us! - Ready? - Yes! Fuwa! Wait! - But I... - Everything is all right. Now that I know that I will die, I will miss you. We quarreled all the time. Though I don't know why now. This night has suddenly become so beautiful. Shiratori. You... You hold on here. APRIL 1945, KUSHIRO AIRBASE SOUTH KYUSHU First Lieutenant Jinnouchi and 28 pilots report their arrival at Uska base. Your 18 colleagues from the 18th Imperial flight unit flew this morning against enemy ships that we located at Okinawa and made suicide attacks against them. They caused severe damage to them. Since you are the pilots of the special attack forces, you should not expect to return alive. Attention! Commander, sir! - Commander! - Attention! What, you're still here? What's so strange about that? They say that Jinnouchi makes you work hard. He's the devil. In battle, you should follow me. I'll show you how to steer your aircraft into a ship. Although I have only one eye, I will not give up my trump card. - Commander! - What? I deeply apologize to you for the eye. I still haven't redeemed myself. What are you talking about? I'm more interested in whether you've learned how to ride a bicycle. You still haven't, have you? Commander... Why is he returning? Nanjo! You came back? He's dead. Honda! Honda! South of Kikaijima Island, we encountered several enemy planes. The commander was killed in battle. I continued west, flying over Tokushima. There was a second battle with enemy planes, resulting in engine damage to my aircraft. The maximum speed I could reach was 100 knots. At the same time, it started to rain, visibility dropped to almost zero. I thought that it would be too difficult to find the target. So I dropped my bomb and flew back to make another flight. Or maybe you only wanted to save your life? No. - Lt. Nanjo. - Yes! As soon as your plane has been repaired, you will take off immediately. Yes, sir. Lt. Nanjo! Enough. You may go now. Lt. Nanjo, allow me to leave! Anytime someone comes back from a suicide attack, it affects the determination of the rest. Commander! What are you saying? Jinnouchi! The commander is right... - If they come back, then... - Don't talk nonsense! Do you have any idea what they have to go through? The feelings of those who are flying to their deaths can only be understood by those that await the exact same fate. Others will never understand. Lt. Nanjo got scared in battle! Dropped his bomb and then ran back! His friend Honda was killed and he didn't care. I refuse point-blank to fly with such a cowardly pilot! Me too! Jinnouchi! I understand your feelings. But I'll tell you one thing. This does not only apply to Nanjo. All the pilots who have been selected for suicide attacks are already removed from the list of officers. He's back again! You there! Yes! Does Siragiku coming here bother you? Speak! Alright! He always arrives at the same time. Whenever Siragiku arrives, a kamikaze attack is always the next day. They say that he brings a list of pilots who will fly to their deaths the next day. Hello! Where have you been wandering? I was at headquarters. The official order hasn't been release yet, but they say, that I was paired with you; you are worth it. Thank you. I couldn't stand it anymore inside the hospital. Because of that injury they didn't want to send me back to Tsutiure. Although I have only one eye, I will not leave a trump card to the student officers and student cadets. Kenmochi. I wished that you... I understand you... That under-achievers like me got one last chance to shine. A kamikaze pilot shouldn't be a particularly good pilot. Kenmochi... First Lt. Jinnouchi, headquarters is calling you. Understood. I just didn't want to die a meaningless death, like some lousy dog. At least you believe me. Stop it, Nanjo! We thought that you were dead. We are happy that our friend is still alive. That's right, Nanjo. Don't worry. I'm not the same as Taki. Allow me to come in! Lt. Nanjo, I'm returning your things that you entrusted to me. - No need. - Why? - I'm flying again soon. - Really? It's likely they will repair my plane tonight. What do you want?! I came to ask Lt. Nanjo about something. Do you think you will get away that easy, getting Honda killed and returning shamelessly. Honda will never be at rest. Lt. Nanjo, you are a coward! Nanjo isn't a coward. - Then let him prove it! - What? If you're not a coward... ...then slit your belly with this. You idiots! Don't you know what it means to be a member of the special attack forces? Do you think that just because you are able to scream here, you can ram your aircraft into an enemy ship? You have to go back to your barracks immediately. An order came for an attack tomorrow. Sgt. Kikuchi, allow me to leave! You will stay. I will announce the names of those who will fly tomorrow. - Lt. Nanjo. - Here! - Lt. Shiratori - Here! - Lt. Fujii. - Here! - Lt. Hanazawa. - Here! That is all. Each of you will lead two groups. That is all. At ease! APRIL 8 TODAY'S ATTACK CANCELLED Jinnouchi! You want me to... Captain Tiga told me what you did. You had me assigned here. To take care of my peace of mind. What? I and the student officers... want to spend the last journey with the one who knows us best. Fortunately, you were in the hospital. So you are the best candidate for that. Jinnouchi! I know that this is a painful task. But you can do it. You say that with one eye, I am only capable of this? No one except you can do that. This is not the last kamikaze attack. I will be going too. I will make a suicide attack with you. Kenmouchi! Jinnouchi. It was reported that during your flight your mother died. Commander, send me to fly instead of Jinnouchi. Kenmochi. As a pilot, I will not leave anyone behind. We cannot lose airplanes for nothing. I can find other people, but no other airplanes. With your vision, you cannot hit the enemy. Commander! A new order has come for you. Listen! First Lt. Kenmochi, on April 8, today, you're entrusted with the training of special attack pilots on this airbase. That is all. Death is sometimes an easier way out. OUR CHICKENS ARE LAYING EGGS EVERY DAY. TAKE THE EGGS TOMORROW TOO. Allow me to enter. Lt. Shiratori! - Did something happen? - Yes, you have visitors. - Who is it? - Your family is here. Over there. Allow me to leave! I almost forgot. Here is your medicine. Tatsuya! When is your flight? Today or tomorrow? What are you saying? Father, take care of mother. Mother, take care of father. Your parents are here, but we can't do anything for you. Father...when I was a kid, you often played sumo wrestling with me. Mother watched us with laughter. It was at that time that I started going to school. I always bragged then that when I reached fifteen, I would be able to defeat father. But at fifteen, I lost. At sixteen, too. On my seventeenth birthday, I finally won. But that evening I was terribly scolded by mother. She said to me: "You should already think like an adult". Mother, do you remember? Since that time, six years have passed. I'm still not what I'm supposed to be, but I've grown to be a strong man. Father. Mother. I thank you for everything. Tatsuya! If we knew that your life would be so short, we would certainly have raised you differently. - Orderly! - Yes! What are you looking at? He hasn't arrived yet! - Siraguki? - Yes! Is that so? I'm pleased with your devotion. Siraguki had his flight today. However, he was intercepted by an enemy aircraft over Kirishima. What? Whether the plane arrives or not, tomorrow's attack will still take place. All the planes of the Kushiro airbase will take part in the suicide attacks at Okinawa. Tonight, we will still be needing your help. Yes! Hey, tell the one who pays for all that he must drink more sake. This is the same sake which is use for sacrifices to the temple gods. This is his last evening. Be gentle with him. Please. - What are you burning? - Photographs. My greatest love. If you have someone, then why are you here with me? Are you angry? Be angry! Why aren't you angry? Because you're a god. A god? Everybody says so. All those generals and our mother. With your death, we will win the war. Am I a god? A good-for-nothing god. What happened? Everybody is lying so easily. If I'm a god, then take the fountain pen out of my pocket. Write what I tell you. - My handwriting is ugly. - It doesn't matter! Write it in big characters. Tomorrow, Jiro... Tomorrow Jiro will become a god. This is my testament. Nanjo, where did you fly to last time? 30 miles north-northeast of Yoron Island. How were you able to return from such a distance? Shiratori... How did you drop the bomb? When you turn the lever... Shiratori. When a person wants to live, even a little bit, it's very painful. It is as if your nerves are all broken. We are already dead. Shiratori! He has so much energy! What? You, come in. Come in. I would like to see you two make peace. Why? Because you will fly to your death together. You wouldn't want to die holding a grudge against each other. Lt. Nanjo! I apologize for my last words! Okay, Kikuchi. I will also be flying tomorrow. You too, commander? - We will all die together! - Yes. Alright. Tonight we will have a good drink to that. Yes! Idiot, do it properly! Taki! Is that you, Taki? It's me, Shiratori. You're alive after all. I see you have suffered a lot. But the fact that you're alive is what matters. This is wonderful, Taki! This one is ready. He's not right in the head. Because of his crime, he is treated as a piece of garbage everywhere he goes. In the end, he lost it. But at least he can carry things. This being a time when we lack manpower. Stop it! Attach this bomb properly. Yes, sir! So... You're already dead. I understand now. No one can avoid war. Shiratori! I will not allow any of you to die for nothing. If there is anything I can do, tell me. This is some medicine which my mother got for me. But it won't help me. May it come in handy for you. Shiratori. You're truly a kind soul. You bastard. Commander! Thank you for everything. Kampai! I want you to hit your target. Attention! Come here! Set you watches to 06:30. In 5 seconds. Now! Listen carefully! Keep in formation no matter what may occur around you. Everyone follow me! - Clear? - Yes, sir! Line up! Dismissed! Communications check. Can you hear me? I hear you. - Sgt. Kukui? - Yes. Plane no. 25 has a broken spark plug. Report this to your superiors. Lt. Nanjo, everything is all right. Let's fly! - Go and report it! - Yes, sir! Remove the chocks! Do it! Remove them now! Let's fly! Lt. Nanjo, wait! Lt. Nanjo, wait! Hanazawa! It's nothing! Everything is okay! Goodbye! AT THIS MOMENT THEY WERE STILL ALIVE ONLY FOUR MONTHS LATER, THE WAR WAS OVER THE END
