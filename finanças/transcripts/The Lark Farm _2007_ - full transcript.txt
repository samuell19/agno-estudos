Stop! Who are you? Stop! Are you Armenian? Answer or I'll shoot! I am an Armenian. - Take another step and I'll shoot! - Shoot me! - Whom are you going to shoot? - Kill me too. - He's a Turk like you, he is Nazim. You are a buffoon, Nazim! - It's Colonel Arkan. - You here around me. Put the weapons down ! It will be charged of major insubordination. I am in command here ! I will charge him for treason of the revolution! Have confidence in me, mylady. I will have them buried, I will call a priest. Go home, although you'll soon have to leave our country ... .. for a long journey. Free the women! Forgive me, my friend. Professor Avakian ... Mom! What is it? What happened? What ... A German officer shot them risking his life. He was there, he saw. Kambussian gave them to me, they have arrived at the Armenians Club. Processions like this one are leaving from each town. - No one knows where they are taking them. - There are no men among them! Maybe they have killed them. Uncle Aram too, dad? No, not Aram. Not him. You must not fear. You two are not Armenians. I'm going to dad. - Are you sick? You have a fever. - Never been so strong! I don't resign myself to sorrow without doing anything. - I will help my people. - It's impossible , you know it. Your people it's us, just us, our children. Livia, I took a decision. - What? - I ... I decided to sell the shares, to collect as much money as possible. So who are those zaptie. They love money, they will accept bribes. Take this too. Why do you keep your eyes low? Tonight I will board the train. I'll change in Vienna and go on to Athens. - I will embark ... - It is madness! No, I will get crazy if I stay here away from Aram and Nunik ... - What did Livia say? - She does not know, I did not have the courage. - You tell her, you will find the words. - Assadour! The first book is ready. Yes, well. An excellent work. - What happens? - I do not know. - Why do you sing? - It's the war! Long live the war! The interventionist won! - We are at war! Hurrah Italy! The borders will be closed, your travel is impossible! Impossible! Maybe my son can help him. My son works at the Spanish consulate. - Spain is neutral. You speak. - Yes. Through the embassy's couriers ... .. we can get those books to our consulate in Aleppo. There they will try to get them where they must go. Thank you. Let's leave him alone. Stop. Make way! The prefect has given us permission to choose an armenian woman. - Even two. - For our domestic needs. If you have the permission, choose. That one has a distinct appearance. You know how to lay the table? How many cutlery and glasses for every cover? She's not good, she doesn't even listen. She is ugly too. Let's take her. She's lean, but we'll make her eat. For me it's ok. Meanwhile eat this. - Leave it! - It's mine! Back on your carriage. Only I decide of my column. - I have permission from the authorities. - Away, is an order. I will report your kindness to the prefect! - The Armenian women are not for you! - I understand, they are for you! - Away! - Why didn't you go with them? - You are waking up! Let her alone, that one does not want confidences! Armineh, you are not ugly. It is the dust that has reduced us in this state. I am unworthy of the confraternity of beggars. I have summoned you to ask for your help. I have to save what remains of the family that has welcomed and loved me. It is an Armenian family that is going to death ... .. and their end will be evil for us too. Because the Armenians have the cult of charity and we live of it. I know that no beggar can afford to give ... A Turk like me should risk his life for some infidels? Help me, brother. Spit in my face, but help me. I have betrayed my benefactresses, Armineh and Nunik. - Why don't you want to help me? - Because you are wicked! This is not the Prophet's will! From heavens he shouts against us ... .. unless we help who has welcomed and fed us. - Where are they taking them to? - Do you know? - Yes. - We want to follow them. - They are going to Aleppo. - What can the confraternity do ? - We will alert that of Aleppo. They are Arabs but they will help us, as we have helped them. They are more organized than us, they are powerful. Prepare a lot of money. - Where are you going? Wait. - I don't feel well. - You can not stop. - My stomach aches. -Walk. - I can't resist. Do it on yourself. Walk. How disgusting! There is a town over there ! - They will help us! - Look! None of the inhabitants must come close or we will fire. Go to warn them. In march! Shoot whoever stops. Silence! I do not want to hear these armenian songs! Arsineh! Arsineh! They believed me dead, but I am smarter than them! - Smarter! - We hide you in the wagon! Come. - No. - Why? - If they do an inspection, it will be the end. They have tried to escape. - They took them ... - Take this. - Armineh, Nunik - The girls ? Avetis? Aunt Hasmig? Talk to us ... Aunt Hasmig ... .. was on the ground. She was sick and did not want to go forward. Let's go, let's go. > She was wearing the robe sewn by all of us, remember? > For her 80 years birthday party. - Armineh? - You wouldn'trecognize my mistress anymore. - Since Zabel gave birth ... - A girl? A boy. Why do you want to do me this? You want kill my son! Look at him! - Zabel! - How can you be afraid of him? We know each other, our families were friends! I had tea at your house. Do you remember? - Orders are orders. - No! - Wait. - You kill him. - Me? How can I? How can I do, Armineh? Help me. Yes. > And the little Avetis? > He is always looking for something to eat, but he can not find anything. No, not her! I am not like my companions. - I do not touch the women of the camp. - You do not touch women already dead. You want me ashamed. Now go. - My name is Youssouf. - I know. - I ... - Nunik. I knew. Wait. I just want you to know ... .. that I wish I wasn't here. I volunteered in the army... .. but I wanted to go to the front for our Turkey. Instead ... This camp ... You ... You are hungry, eat something. - No, it's for the children. - I don't even like the bread here ! It is not like the one they bake at home. I grew up among farmers and when I left ... .. everyone cried. But they were proud of me and my choice. I hope that they will never know. Get dressed, I do not want to see you like this before me. Wait. - Grab her! - Come here! - Don't move ! - Don't come close ! - Stay back! Tie her at the stake and prepare the torches. You know my law for those who attempt to flee from my column! First the fire and then the head! Back. Ahead with the torches. I am not afraid to die, but the torture ... You will not allow them to torture me, right? Promise me. No, I promise. Before any of them rape me, I want you to have me. A good carpenter will set up a wagon of hay ... .. with a double bottom and will take it near the camp. 200 pounds. Others of us will bribe at least four guards. - 400 pounds. - My man at the Pasha's will warn us ... .. if anything happens before the Armenians arrive at Deir-er-Zor ... .. from where ... You know, right? No one will come back. - 500 pounds. - Plus what you owe to the confraternity. Total ... .. 1,400 pounds. The jewels are of value, but not enough. It takes at least twice as much. Nazim, I respect you. I do not care for Armenians ... .. although I think that you shear the sheep and you don't kill it. But the brotherhood has its laws and you know them. Here. Eat. Eat. - Nunik, you eat too. - No. Stand up. We're hungry, where is the bread? You know where the bread is! - Go and take it! - It's not there! I gave you all of it! Enough! - What do you want from me yet? - Bad! Where are you hiding it? Nunik! I must have gotten lost, I do not know where we are. At Aleppo. Under the walls of Aleppo. And we're still together. It is a beautiful city. Once a friend told me about it. Yes. It's wonderful, I'm watching it now. Nazim! - It's worthless! - I know. Armineh said that this was a gift from the Spanish consul ... .. who had been their guest. His name is Luis Armendariz, she told me to go to him with this. - We will find the consul. - How? - The confraternity will help us. - Stop. - I am the consul of Spain, I live in this hotel. Excuse us. Please go on. - What do you want? - We won't hurt you. - Let me go! -Are you the consul Armendariz ? - Yes. - What does it mean? - Look at this jewel. Look at it, it belongs to Armineh. Do you remember her? - Armineh. - Armineh? - Yes. - Avakian. - Yes. She is here among the deportees. - You must help us to save her. - Yes. Come with me. I here in the luxury and Armineh out there. - During the past months... - Thanks. - I felt like... .. an accomplice of her persecutors. - No, thanks. Because I couldn't help neither her nor her family. I asked, tried and risked, but it was useless. - What's your name? Ismene ? - Yes. I thought that there was nothing to do and I had given up. And this was my justification. These volumes had arrived from Italy some time ago. I had been entrusted with them, but whom could give them to? Nazim, is it you? - You don't recognize me, do you? - Of course yes, Nunik. Tonight, an hour before dawn, be all close together and be ready. We will rescue you. We bribed the guards. Keep the children close to you. Armineh? I am here to tell you that by tomorrow you will not see these walls again ... .. and you will not sleep among the dead. You will not feel the smell of the plague. Nazim makes you this promise. Sleep, Armineh. Why are you shaking? I am here with you. I will always be with you. I asked to be transferred to a garrison close to my woods. The captain has promised and you will come with me. Nobody will have anything to say, he too has taken an Armenian woman. Youssouf, I ... I am not coming with you. I won't have any other wives, there will be only you. - How can I tell you? - If you will not want to stay ... I came to say goodbye. Tonight I will escape from the camp with my family. It is not true. - It is not true. - Yes, it is. I wish I didn't tell you ... So why did you tell me? How can you think that I would disappear like this from your life? That I wouldn't have tried to see you again? I am grateful to you, you're a good man. No, I'm not, since I'm going to prevent it. - Tell me who will help you to escape. - Do not ask me. No, I will not ask you, I don't want to know it. I won't do anything, they will be free to go ... .. but you will stay with me. The children alone, they will never make it. If you don't stay with me, I will denounce you. I'll do it. To have you with me, I am capable of it. I am like a zaptie and I can do what I want of you. - I feel trapped. - From me? - From you... - From everything. - It is not so. You've been gentle with me and I tried to be as you wanted me. I gave you my tenderness ... Tenderness ... Not love. I would like to be in love you, but by now ... .. I cannot be in love with anyone, not anymore. Am I going to see you again? - There is little time, the commander is about come back. - Hurry up. - Wake up. Look. Would you like the apple? - It is mine. - Stand up. I take care of Armineh. - Let me sleep. - Later. Armineh, come. - Stand up. - Yes. Quiet, don't make noise. Go to check over there. - I dropped the apple! - Shut up! Go. - I'll take it, run. What's up there? Bring here the rebel, make her stop. Stop. It is forbidden to sing. Do you know what happens to those who rebel. First the fire and then the head. Bring here the torches! Ahead with the fire! Avetis and the two girls were embarked clandestinely in Smyrna on a Spanish cargo ship that brought them to Venice. Armineh outlived herself until she saw the children brought to safety. Istanbul. Four years later. The war is over. Trial for crimes against the armenian people. My superiors have warned me not to speak. They deny the truth. But I have seen with my own eyes the slaughter after the stop in Aleppo we forced the deportees to resume the forced march up to up to Deir-er-Zor There those who survived hunger, thirst and fatigue were all massacred. We have only done our duty! You'll pay for this ! Enough ! I order you to be silent! Do you intend to denounce anyone in particular? I've asked a question. Do you intend to denounce anyone in particular? Me for the first. I ... I killed an Armenian girl her name was Nunik Avakian she was the woman I loved. After the first convictions the trials were suspended. The Armenian people still awaits justice.
