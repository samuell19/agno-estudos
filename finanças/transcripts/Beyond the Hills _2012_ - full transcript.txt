Beyond the hills Stay there! Calm down, now. Alina... Alina, let me go. People are looking. Did you write that? No. It looks like your writing. No, Father put it up last year. Listen, I haven't told anyone yet. Don't start talking before I explain. Why didn't you tell them? Father's been busy. I haven't had a chance. THIS IS THE HOUSE OF GOD FORBIDDEN TO THOSE OF OTHER RELIGIONS BELIEVE AND DO NOT DOUBT Look. An electric candle. Thanks, but we don't have electricity here. I'll keep it anyway. It's pretty. Is this all of your stuff? I gave the rest away. You have any suitcases? I've got some big bags down there. Want to lie down a bit? - No. Then let's go wash up. - Can I help? - No. This has been my chore since I came. - What has? - Getting water. Everything's very organized here. Every morning Papa tells each of us what to do, and Mama helps us if we need it. You call the priest “Papa”? If other people are around, we call him “Father” too. That was done by a painter Papa brought in to paint the church. It was more like a test. We didn't have enough money, so in the end that's all he painted. It's a shame. May we be blessed. God bless. - Mama, this is Alina. - Welcome. - Sister Elisabeta. - Sister Pahomia. - Sister Antonia. - Sister lustina. Voichita, take this bucket to Father. Will you stay with the girls? No one's going to eat her! Bless me, Father. Stick some clay around these edges. It's cracked, and smoke is getting out. Finish up by tomorrow evening. Mr. Dima's coming. Understand? - Yes. What is it? Papa, I wanted to ask you something. Go ahead. It's about my friend Alina. She lives in Germany now. We're friends from the orphanage. - Isn't she here yet? Yes, she's in the kitchen with Mama and the girls. But she's - How can I put this? It's really hard for her in Germany. She's all alone with her problems, without a shoulder to cry on. Is she a believer? She goes to church now and then, but... Does she at least go to confession? I don't think so. She's been in Germany for years. How does she expect to find peace without going to confession or mass? What she wants most is not to be alone anymore. We were always together at the orphanage. It's really tough for her now. You can be surrounded by people, but without God in your soul - I told her that, but she says I should go to Germany with her, or she's afraid of what might happen. She asked you to go? Just until she gets over these thoughts and calms down a bit. I thought you'd chosen the path you want to follow. I have. I was telling you what she wants. I'd come back as soon as she feels better. The way of Jesus isn't like that. You can't be his servant just now and then. Continuity is crucial in this spiritual life of ours. You can't take a break when you feel like it, you understand? Yes, Papa. The man who leaves isn't the same man who returns. You understand? Yes, Papa. Mr. Valerica found a painter for the church. - How much? - 100 million. We can't afford that now. - Should I ask Mr. Dima? - Ask him what? - About a painter. - Don't bother Mr. Dima with that. Construction is one thing, but to pay for the painting too... He's sending someone to pour cement tomorrow, if there's a spare vehicle and it's not too cold. If it's cold, he says to wait till it warms up. - We need it done by Easter. - Of course. If God will just send us good weather! It'll start warming up. Oh, and the gas cylinder's empty. Exchange it when you take the food for the children. - We'll need money. - It's all gone from yesterday? I bought towels, and chains for the dog. He keeps breaking them. Get some padlocks to hold them together. I got padlocks too. Did those folks pay us for the soup? No. And Mr. Valerica said now they want eggs too. - How many go to the orphanage? - Pretty much all of them. Tell them we'll give them eggs after Easter. But they need them for Easter. - But the children need them, right? - Of course. Ask him. What about the gas cylinder? Ask for credit. Or else we'll cook over a hearth. We don't have much wood left either. We'll get wood from the forest. Papa, could Alina go into town with us? She needs some documents. - Is there room in the car? - Yes, we'll put the food in the trunk. Are you changing your residence status? No, they're papers for working in Germany. Germany? Well, I've never left the country, but I have no regrets. I'd go visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but not the West. The West has lost the true faith. There's nothing sacred left. Everything's allowed. Men marry men, women marry women. There are drugs everywhere. Even the church isn't what it used to be. I'm all for tolerance, but within reason. Was there a church where you were living? - Yes, but not our kind. - Pardon? They're not Orthodox. For a true believer, even entering a non-Orthodox church is a sin. But poor people don't think about that now. They go wherever they can, to earn money, for their kids. Meanwhile, the kids grow up without their mothers and fathers, and we wonder why such terrible things happen. It's because there's no one to guide those children, to take them to church, to teach them good from evil. So you couldn't go to confession. You'd better come and make a confession. Lent's coming soon. It's the right thing to do. I'll see you tomorrow morning. When a man's sins are forgiven, he finds peace. You'll see. That's true. Let us pray. You have a fever. You probably sat in a draft on the train. - Will you give me a rubdown? - I have no rubbing alcohol. I do. Let's do it on your bed. - We're not sleeping together? - No. Why not? It's against monastery rules. Why? It's not right. Lent is coming. We have to be careful. Why was that Antonia looking at you like that? - Like what? - I don't know. Like... You're imagining things. Are you two close friends? I have no close friends here. We help each other, that's all. Why did he tell me to come confess? It's good for you. It'll calm you down. God is good and forgives you, but you have to confess your sins first so that you can move on. You have to tell everything at confession. Did you tell everything? You needn't go into detail. Just say which sins you've committed. - How old is Father? - Papa? About 30. Stop calling him “Papa.” They say Father saw an angel, and that's why he became a monk. Where did he see it? He was working in a power plant, and an angel appeared to him. What did it look like? I don't know. He doesn't talk about such things with us. It's been really hard without you, Voichita. That's enough for now. I'm tired. Put this on so you don't catch cold. I'm going to pray. Go on. Wait here a minute. Papa? " Yes? - I've come with Alina. - Just a minute. He's coming. Why is it forbidden to wear pants to confession? It's not forbidden. It's just not proper. Do I kiss his hand? Don't worry. He'll tell you what to do. What's he doing in there? Preparing himself. They say Father has an icon on the altar that works miracles. Really? If you pray to it, does it grant all your wishes? Tell him everything, okay? How was it? What's wrong? You have a fever. Come lie down a minute. Are you ready? It's late! Coming. Stay here and rest. I'll go alone, okay? - And my diploma? - I'll take care of it. Go on. - Are you coming? - Yes. Tell Vali they're here with the food. - How is it going? - Okay. Hello, Mother. How are you, Camelia? Fine. Come get the food. Mother, did you speak to Father? Yes. He'd be happy to take you, but we don't have room. If Sister Pahomia leaves, then we'll see. I have to leave the orphanage next month. Why don't you ask the director to keep you on? I'm already too old for this place. She can't help me anymore. When we finish the new cells, we'll have room. When will that be? It depends how much money we can raise, but so far... ls Sister Pahomia looking to leave? She says no, but from the way she talks to her husband, I think she'll go home. Didn't she say he beat her? Yes, but in the end he's her husband. If she leaves, can I come? I think so. There's plenty of work. Work's no problem, but I have no money to give. Father wouldn't ask you for money! He knows you're from the orphanage. How's Valentin? Fine. He gets out of the hospital tomorrow. I brought him a cake. Can you give it to him? Of course. I'll be staying a while. I have to get Alina's papers. Fine. God bless. - God bless. - God bless you, Camelia. Watch out for the mud. Is Alina here? Yes. Is her brother around? No, he got a job washing cars. Did you speak to our old teacher like I asked? No, her husband's sick in the hospital right now. Did you miss this place? No. Coming in for a visit? No, I have things to do. - Bye, then. - Bye. - Where do you want to travel to? - Germany. For what purpose? To visit a friend. For how long? I'm not sure yet. Did you take Mr. Neamtu's file? No. You know you must return here after three months? I'm not staying that long. - Any income? - What? You have money to show at the border? I think so. My friend's handling that. Don't forget to congratulate Luciana today. Isn't she a Libra? It's her name day. She's also called Valentina. How will you provide for yourself in Germany? I'll work. Doing what? I'm not sure yet. Waitress on a cruise ship, maybe. - A cruise ship? - Yes. Legal employment? I think so. Hand me that file with the photos. Which Luciana do you mean? - From accounting. Ah, accounting. I was thinking of Mrs. Nistor. No, not Mrs. Nistor. You know she's getting divorced? - No kidding. Her husband fell in love with a 25-year-old. They say the girl used witchcraft. Now Mrs. Nistor is visiting old witches to break the spell and curse the girl. God protect us! With that belly of yours, be careful your wife doesn't find a younger guy. She wouldn't leave me. She put me on a diet. See there? Didn't Mrs. Nistor's husband have a colostomy? You know how love is, sweetheart. You know a German guy named Pfaff? - Yes. - From where? The orphanage. I grew up at the lulia Hasdeu orphanage. What did he do there? He brought us aid. Did he ever ask you to work in Germany? No. Did he take pictures of you? Yes. What kind of pictures? All kinds... I see. You want to file a complaint? No. None of you will file a complaint, but when it happens, you come crying to us. Goddamn computer! - Toss the thing. I paid 14 million for it. - Present occupation? - Nun at the monastery on the hill. A nun? So why go to Germany? To help my friend. I thought nuns just prayed all day. We do that too. Sign here. Be careful whom you trust. There are all kinds of people. What are you doing? Feeling better? What's all this? Your luggage- Why are you packing for me? You know I don't like anyone touching my things. Do it yourself, then. Why are you half dressed? You want to catch cold? - Any cotton wool? - Other side. Alina, you went to confession like that? It's a terrible sin, you know. Did you get my diploma? They wouldn't give it to me. - I really need it. - I'll get it Monday. Our tickets are for Monday. We'll change them. And the bus tickets to Germany? Voichit_a, we have to be at work on Thursday, or the ship sails and we lose the job. I spoke to Father. If I leave, he won't take me back. - What? - That's what he said. - So what? - What do you mean? We said we'd stay together from now on. Why come back here? Yes, but we didn't agree to go on a ship. Where else can we go? Alina, I've chosen a different path. I can't just walk away from it. What different path? The path that means I'll never be alone. You'll be with me! Sure, but... without God in your soul, no matter who you're with, you'll still be all alone. Voichit_a, what are you saying? You're all I have. I don't need anyone else. That's not good. People come and go. Only God is with you always. You think it wasn't hard for me when you left? It was tough. Really tough. But God helped me, and I found comfort here with Mama and Papa. Voichita, you said I'm your family, and now I need your help. I'm going crazy all alone there. Just like I helped you at the orphanage. Didn't I help you too? Do you still love me? I love you, but not like before. How, then? I don't know. It's different. Different how? Why? Because I'm different now. - I have someone else in my soul now. - Who? Who's in your soul besides me? What's happened to you? People change, Alina. The man who leaves isn't the same man who returns. Do you love this priest? - How can you ask that? - Do you fuck him? Is that it? What's he told you to mess you up like this? I pity you, Alina, that you can't understand. I don't know how to help you. It's you who needs help. Please unpack my things. Come on, boy. To your servant Elisabeta we offer this communion, the body and blood of the Lord our God, Jesus Christ. Forgive her her sins and grant her eternal life. What is it, Alina? Is there something funny about what we're doing? Do you want to take communion? - No. I'm dirty. Pardon me? It's her time of the month, Father. Then please wait outside. - You're kicking me out of church? - Alina! What? God is for everyone, not just for you. Alina, if you're upset, please go outside and quiet down. I'll be right out to talk to you. Close the door. What's wrong with her? She's troubled, Papa, but it will pass. Are you sure she confessed everything? I don't know, Papa. Mother... go talk to her and see what's wrong. This is because of her confession. Papa, she's going to jump down the well! She banged her head on the well, and now she's perched over it. Alina, come away from the well. My God, what's wrong with her? Alina... - Leave me alone. Alina, come away from the well. Let's talk. Maybe you forgot something in confession. Did you? Come, Alina! You'll feel better if you talk about it. There, now. Calm down. Grab her! - Let go of me! - Stop it, Alina! Hold her down! It's okay. Calm down! God help us! What's wrong with her? I don't know what came over her. Let's get her to a cell. Have you calmed down? Calm down. Be good. Get her some slippers. Are you all right, Sister? - Where are my glasses? You think there's some greater sin she didn't confess? - Did you mention masturbation? - My God! I'll kill you! Get the rope from the bells, quick! We have to get her to the hospital! Go tell Mr. Valerica to call an ambulance! Hello? Please send an ambulance now! We have a very sick girl here! She can't breathe, and she's very agitated. Twenty-five years old. Ringhis, Alina. Smighelski, Voichita. The sick girl's last name is Ringhis. Smi-ghel-ski. That's right. The New Hill Monastery. Yes, that's the address. We can't bring her there! This is a monastery! What? Tie her ankles. Tie them tight. They said to pray for her. There's no ambulance available. Antonia, you try and convince them. Hello? Ma'am, I was a nurse. This girl needs to get to a hospital! I have nothing to give her an injection with! She's having convulsions, a sort of epileptic fit. And she's bleeding where she hit herself. Dear Lord! Father, what happened? - We have to get her to the hospital! - There's no ambulance right now. Let's take her ourselves. She'll die waiting for them! Let's go, then! Help me lift her! We're going to the hospital! Calm down, Alina! There, there. Calm down. Gina! Tell the doctor to come down a minute. Sandra! Call the doctor. - Good evening. - What is it? A very agitated girl. The psych ward turned them away. - Where is she? - In the car. - Bring her in. - They say she's violent. Bring a gurney. Come on. Good evening. What's going on? We've brought a girl here who's extremely agitated. - Where is she? - They're bringing her in now. There, there. Calm down. - Who tied her up like this? - Father did. She was going to jump down the well. Why did you gag her? She was biting and spitting and swearing at us. - How old is she? - Twenty-four. She'll be 25 this March. Poor thing! Careful, Doctor. She hit all of us! What's wrong with her? We don't know. It came on suddenly. She's crying one minute and laughing the next. Make room in the ward. Tell Sandra to get a haloperidol and a diazepam shot ready. God help her! Calm down, Alina! Be good! God, she's strong! Can we untie her now? Wait for it to take effect. The poor girl's 15. Jumped out a window when she didn't get her period. God help her. - Gina, you have my phone? - It's charging. Come fill out the forms. Yes, Doctor. Could you come give us her particulars? You go. Why did you bring her here? Better to keep her there and pray for her. At the orphanage, did they take you to church? They took us on an excursion to a monastery once. Apart from that, it was up to us if we went on Sundays. Did she go? Now and then, but not often. Who knows what hidden sins she's paying for now. She's less of a sinner than many girls who spend all day in church. - You said the boys made you do stuff. - Not Alina. She'd beat them up. No one could take her on. That's why she took up karate. Did she beat you up too? She protected me. - What did she want in return? - Nothing. We were friends, that's all. Something must be wrong with her. Back home I had a neighbor who woke up one night to find her husband staring at her, but his eyes had changed. They were usually brown. Now they were black. And he spoke in a different voice. She asked him, “What's wrong with you?” He didn't answer, and next day he didn't remember a thing. At his job they were building apartments over an old cemetery. God protect us! What was she doing in Germany? She did housework. She worked in a bar. I hope she didn't join some cult there. What kind of bar? I don't know. Just a bar. She worked as a waitress. Didn't she find you work there too? Hoping to get rid of me? A devout cousin of mine wants to join a monastery, but in Bucharest they asked for money, and she can't pay. - Ask Sister Pahomia. - Ask me what? I heard you're going back to your husband. Who told you such a thing? He comes around hoping I'll go back, but I don't want another child. If God decided to take my boy, what can I do? At least here I'm closer to him. Poor thing. God bless. From Mrs. Dima. Arcadia... go with lustina and Lavrentia and set the table. Get chairs from Mr. Valerica if you need them. Where did you put the new towels? In the bathroom. Antonia, go wrap the bread in them. And put clean towels in the bathroom for the people. Mama, may I visit Alina at the hospital after the meal? Elisabeta. Take these and tie up the dog. He broke his chain again. Go on. Voichit_a, stop bringing dogs in. The yard's full of them. And clean these. As for the hospital, wait until Father arrives. Mama, they're alive! They're best that way. They jump in the frying pan! You go in first. Ma'am, it's good to see you. Voichit_a, how are you? I'm fine. I hear you went to get Alina's diploma. Yes, she's in the hospital now. What's wrong with her? I don't know. I'm seeing her later. Can I give you a ride? I'll ask Mother if it's all right. - How's her brother? - He's working now. Irina had her baby! - Really? Boy or girl? - Boy. Congratulations! What's his name? George, so it works both here and there. She's in Brisbane, waiting for me to come help her. When do you leave? I should have left already, but I have to look after my husband now. - What's wrong with him? - The poor man's very sick. The doctors told me it's hopeless and to prepare for the worst. Don't despair, ma'am. God is great, and wonders can happen if you have faith. My husband has throat cancer, and it's metastasized. It doesn't matter. My sister-in-law had breast cancer. Father prayed with her and read from Scripture. Now she's fit as a fiddle. Every case is different. Father has a great gift. Speak to him. Maybe he can help. Father will be here soon. He's at the bishopric. He sends apologies for being late. What delay? We're in no hurry. It's hard. They're not fond of him there since he gave up his salary. They watch his every move. You think the bishop won't consecrate the church just because it's not painted? That's life. We have to carry on, as God desires. Please sit for a while until Father arrives. Don't worry. I'll come back another time. As you wish... May I go into town with her, Mother? She's offered me a ride. All right. God bless you. God bless. Ionut! How are you? Fine. Put something on over that. You want to get hurt? It's no big deal. You have any money? No. Your sister's in the hospital. We should bring her some food. Go ask for some money. They won't give me any. Want to come see her? Yeah. Will they let you leave? I think so. Go ask. And ask for some money. Hey, tell the boss I'll be gone a while. Go call the nurse. Tell her she's awake. See? If you pray... How do you feel? Want some water? No. Does anything hurt? No. Don't ever leave me alone again. I won't. What did you say to wake her up? I don't know. How are you, sweetheart? You had us all worried. What's your name? - Alina. Let her speak. - Alina. - What? - Alina. - Alina what? Ringhis? And where are you from? Razboieni. That's why you're such a fighter. Hungry? - No. - Thirsty? - No. Does anything hurt? No. What do you do at the monastery? - I came to get her. - Louder. - She came to see me. - Oh? We were roommates at the orphanage. Where do you live now? - There's a foster family - - Let her answer. My official address is with a family in Sintesti, but I've been living in Germany. Germany? Very nice. And what did you do in Germany? I worked. Nice. - And you missed home. - No, I missed her. So you're going back to Germany? We're going to work on a cruise ship. A cruise ship? Fantastic! But tell me... why did you attack the nurses? Or don't you remember? Back to your beds, ladies. Let me speak to the girl. Tell me, Alina... do you sometimes hear voices? Or have the impression someone's following you? Sometimes, yes. It seems to me I heard a voice. When was that? A while back. - Do you hear it now? - No. What did that voice tell you? It told me what to do. So you heard it before coming to the monastery. She used to hear her dad's voice. Where is your father? He hanged himself when she was six. Could you untie me now? In a bit. Just be patient. I need to go to the bathroom. Marcela... remove her straps. No, Doctor. You know how strong she is? Did you hear me? Prepare a haloperidol and remove the straps. Doctor, could you stop giving her medication and see how she behaves? Great! Now you're telling me how to do my job. Be good, okay? Go on, eat. Thank you. I asked Mr. Valerica if lonut might stay there and work for him. Put down a blanket for him tonight in the new cells. Tomorrow we'll see. Yes, Mama. Thank you. Let's go. Father is waiting. What did the doctor say? He said she'll be okay, but she needs rest and quiet. Did he say what was wrong with her? He said you or Mama should go talk to him. - Go speak to him, Mother. - Yes, Father. But he said God knows how these diseases work. He said he knows you from when you both played sports. That could be. When they let her out, could we keep her here until she's better? She has nowhere else to go. We're already overcrowded. How can we take in others? I'll take care of her if you let her stay. Where will she sleep? With me. What about medication and food? She left some money set aside with the family she used to stay with. This isn't a hotel or a nursing home. This is a place for those who have Christ in their hearts. If you don't - or worse, if you have someone else there - best not to come and disrupt those who do. Understand? Yes, but if we let her stay, she might discover God and find her way. And if she doesn't? I like her and want to help her, but I don't want any commotion here. You know that people are watching us closely. She has no one but me to take care of her. Just until she's a little better, Father. Fine. But you take complete responsibility for her. If she causes trouble, you both have to go. Mark my words. - Yes, Papa. Go on, now. - What time is it? - 11:00. - What day is today? - Monday. I brought you some oranges. Mama Elena says to get well soon. I called her on your phone. - How's my brother? - Fine. Father let him stay and work. He'll send him to a monastery. - Anyone call me from Germany? - No, no one's called. - Have you spoken to the doctor? - Yeah. How long will they keep me here? Mama's gone to see him. What did he say is wrong with me? He said you need rest. But he gave me some pills. You need peace and quiet too so you don't get worse. There's no peace and quiet here. Alina, I spoke to Father. You can stay with us so I can take care of you. But you have to behave, or they'll kick us both out. Can I sleep with you? If you behave. But first you have to let God into your heart if you want to get better. How do I let him in? He won't force his way in. If you really want him, fine. If not, he'll leave you alone until the day you realize how much you need him. What do I have to do? You have to pray... and learn to recognize your sins and avoid committing them. Then will you love me again? I love you, Alina, but what matters is God's love for you. Then you'll see how much better you'll feel. I'd just rather you loved me. I love you too, but you can't compare my love with God's. Wait a minute. Will you take her with you, Mother? Is she well now, Doctor? No, but she won't get any better here. What's wrong with her? It's hard to say. But besides her suffering, she has a lung infection. We don't know from where. Have you seen her behavior? We were terrified of her. She's on medication now, so she's within normal parameters. But she needs a lot of rest to recover. She must be kept under observation. Is it something serious? “Serious”? These illnesses don't kill you, but they don't let you live either. Then shouldn't she stay here? I'd keep her here longer... but they're renovating the new wing, so we're very crowded here. In her condition... making her share a bed would only make things worse. She'll get more rest at the monastery. Yes, I think it'd be quieter there. I don't know... Her medication will be the same as here. - You know best. - Will Father take her in? If it's necessary, he will. I think it'd be much better for her. We have lots of sick and agitated patients, and occasional deaths. She needs to be shielded from that stress right now. Very well, Doctor. Then that's settled. I'll prescribe... two medications. They're available at the pharmacy. One's expensive, the other's cheaper. I'll let you work that out. Zyprexa ... and levomepromazine. The pharmacy's on Steven the Great Boulevard. Your name? - My name on my ID? - Yes, for the records. - Arvinte, Domnica. Sign here that you're taking her. Give her one Zyprexa a day and one levomepromazine three times a day. And have her read the Psalms. It'll help. I'll start saying the alphabet: A. Stop. T... Target. Etymology. Gyroscope. Pe“.pendant “NT” - you lose! What's a pheasant? I said “pendant”, not “pheasant”! God bless. They released you already? Could you boil some water, please? The doctor said she'd do better here with us now. I see. Sit down while I get things ready. Father hasn't blessed your cell yet. He's been busy. Where is Father? In the church. Wait for me here, okay? She said she wants to confess? Yes, she says she wants to find peace and calm. But then I'd have to give her penance. I told her that, Papa. I think she's very weak right now. Yes, but perhaps it will help her. What did the doctor say? He sent you this. To pray for his family. Wait here a minute. - Read the list of sins to her. - All right. Explain if she doesn't understand. Have her mark each one she's committed. When you're done, bring her to confess. Thank you. And I'll bless your cell to drive off all evil. Thank you, Papa. “With this list of sins we can discover the hidden sins we've committed, or things we didn't realize were sins.” How many are there? - 464. - You should have some paper. During confession you may not remember all your sins. It's like the devil takes over your mind and you forget. - Shall I start? - Go ahead. “The simplest way is to take pen and paper and, as you read, mark the sins you've committed.” Did you go to confession often before coming here? No. If you can't confess everything, it's best not to confess at all. Because not only are the ones you confess not forgiven, but they double in force. She'll manage. Read. It says... “I despaired of God's aid and mercy.” If you doubted God exists and that he can help you. If you don't understand, don't be ashamed to ask. The shame lies in committing a sin, not acknowledging it. May I? “L thought God wouldn't forgive me, because having sinned so much, I'm already doomed to hell.” Write down the number. Write down Let her do it her way. Fine. Read the number of each sin. Okay. “L believed - 3. I believed God would save me if he chose to.” And never thinking about salvation is a sin too. “4. I believed God had forgotten me and wouldn't help me.” “5. I believed there is much evil in the world, and God does nothing.” So why doesn't he do anything? So you thought that. Mark it down. Don't stop. Just keep reading. I'll mark them right in the book and erase it later. Got an eraser? “6... I doubted the existence of God, heaven, hell, angels, and devils because I'd never seen them.” “7. I considered Holy Scripture a lie and doubted events and miracles told of therein.” “8. I insulted, trod upon, or cast aside holy books.” “9. I cannot bear talk of God. I've had dark moments when I wouldn't listen to talk of God and faith.” “10. I blasphemed against God, the saints, the Holy Virgin, etc.” “11. I've had too great faith in God's mercy, believing that in his goodness he'd forgive me regardless.” “12. I've had thoughts of suicide or caused another's suicide.” “13. I've smoked or taken drugs. Smoking and drugs are suicide.” “14. I've sworn using the names of holy things: the church, icons, candles, God, Jesus, frankincense, etc.” “15. I'm easily upset and have lost my temper with my neighbor.” “16. I've hated and yelled at others. I've sought out arguments with others.” “17. I took revenge on others instead of forgiving them.” “18. I spoke ill of my neighbor.” “19. I cannot stand those who do me injustice.” “20. I have blasphemed the saints and taught my children to do so.” “21. I've struck others in anger and spat at them.” fizz. . ." Will you sing for me? Sleep, little one, sleep tight As angels hover in flight To peer at you through the glass As butterflies sing in the grass The fire is now burning low Nothing but ashes and glow Let your drowsy dreams take flight My little one, sleep tight Sleep tight... - Did he absolve you? - Yes. - And penance? - A thousand Hail Marys and fasting. Here. Bow down before the Virgin, then say 33 Hail Marys. Then make a mark with the pen and paper. And so on until you finish. If you get tired, stop and rest. Okay? - Yes. - Good. Where's Father? In his cell. Come quick! Sister Antonia has fainted! Bring some water! - What's wrong? - Sister Antonia's fainted. Sister Antonia was chopping wood when she saw a black cross in that pine log. That one. And the hens haven't laid eggs in three days. Go back to your chores. Enough of this nonsense about signs. What do we do with the log? Use it for firewood. What else? - What time is it? - 2:00. - Is it snowing? - A little. Want me to stay? As you like. “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Far am I from my redemption, brought further away by my mistakes. My Lord, I cry out to you day and night, but you turn not your gaze towards me. You reside among the glory of Israel. In you our fathers put their faith, and in their faith you forgave them. To you they cried out, in you they trusted, and in you they found no shame -” Alina, what's wrong? Why aren't you asleep? What are you doing here? Reading the Psalms. This late? Yes, it's required. You two are reading together? Leave me alone. I thought you were asleep. Don't go off like that again. All right. Go back to bed now. - Aren't you coming? - I have to read. I'm not going back alone. I'll be right here. No. - Want to stay while we read? - Yes. Kneel down here. Put this on. Sister, the stove needs more work. Smoke is still escaping. Yes, Mother. What? The devil's in her! We must tell Father! Calm down! What did she say? Awful things! And in a different voice! I'll speak to her. Please don't tell Father. Good Lord! Take Alina and go see Father. - Where is he? - In his cell. Come in. Have a seat. Alina, how can I put this? In a monastery... one must free oneself of all worldly things. In order to think only of God and to live in his holy grace, one must leave home and possessions behind. Money is the eye of the devil, they say. And one must put love for God above love for one's fellow creatures. Why? So there's nothing to draw one back to worldly life and its appetites. The devil is very cunning. He'll lure you into desiring things so that you forget God. You think you're satisfying your own needs, but it's the devil you're serving. If you ever decide to take this path, we'll welcome you with open arms. But first you must give over all you have in the world and turn over any money or possessions to the monastery. As you've seen, we're like a family here. Everyone contributes what they can. But it doesn't seem to me that you're ready to take that step. So I suggest you take time to calmly reflect, and when you've made a decision, come and tell me. What did I do, Father? It's not about what you did or didn't do. Monastic life is for those who wish to follow this path. You can't decide whether to stay or go, and it's disrupting the others. You understand? Mr. Valerica's waiting for you. You can set off as soon as you've packed. Wait for me outside. You're coming with me, right? You may go with her. Papa, where's she supposed to go? Didn't she have a foster family? She left there years ago. They just keep her things. I don't know. Go and see. With God's help, she'll get better if she stays here. You can't force God into someone's heart. You understand? Sister, I warned you. Let her decide, and we'll obey God's will. Go on now. Bless me. - Help yourself. - No, thank you. Please! They're for Lent. Thank you. And you? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Help yourself. - Thank you. I'll just take one too. They're so tasty. So what did the doctors say? She needs to rest. So we thought she should stay here till she gets better, and we'll see after that. I told her Germany wasn't a good idea, that she'd work too hard. But did she listen? Among all those foreigners, who knows what bad influences she encountered? Kids from the orphanage are a real challenge, but we wanted to help, and they're just poor kids. When Alina first saw she'd have her own room, she was so excited! And she showered every day, until my husband said... “Go easy on the water! That stuff costs money!” But she's a hard worker. No complaints there. Look, Mama Elena. Alina brought this. It's electric. Thanks. She shouldn't have. Where's her room? Down the hall. - I'll just go see her. - Go ahead. Straight down the hall. You'll find it. Is this your room? Yes. It's nice. It's fine. We have our own bathroom. I have to go now. Mr. Valerica's in a hurry. You're leaving with them? Well, yes. What about me? It's better for you to stay here a while to relax and think things over. Shouldn't you stay and think things over too? I'll come visit you. I'll ask Father to let me come stay this Saturday. Sunday too, if you want. We can think and talk things over. But for now I have to go. Behave yourself, okay? I'll be back soon. So soon that I won't even say “bye.” Be good. We didn't approve when Alina went to Germany, but we let her go. Her brother took her place, but he comes and goes in a daze. You can't count on him. Father's going to send him to a monastery. Really? Then we won't wait around for him any longer. Mama, shall we go? - Won't you stay for dinner? - No, it'll be getting dark. As you wish. Perhaps you should stay here with her for a while. Stay here? My husband will be back soon from fishing. Stay for dinner. Thank you, but Father is expecting us. We'd better be going. Who do those clothes in the wardrobe belong to? The girl who helps us out. You took some other girl in my place? - For work, sweetheart. - And you gave her my room? You said you'd be staying in Germany. Where are my things? In the outside kitchen. And my clothes? They're nicely packed away in bags. They were gathering dust in there. Take them whenever you need them. I want to give them away. What do you mean? I have to give everything away. Money is the eye of the devil. What are you talking about? Alina, don't be hasty. Rest here a while. When you're feeling better, Father will be waiting. No, I've decided. I'd like my money too. They need it to consecrate the church. God forbid! Alina! Alina, stay here a while. Mama, if she's decided she wants to join us... Hurry. We need to get back before dark. We have to wait for Nusu for the money. - Is the kitchen unlocked? - The key's in its place. Wait. I'll come help. Alina, what's gotten into you? You don't know all the sins I'd committed. Father had to give me a thousand Hail Marys. My Lord! What sins could you have committed? Give all these colorful clothes away. - And these dark ones? - Can we take them, Mama? Alina, Father talked to you about something. He said I could come if I gave everything away, right? Are these all pants? Give them away. It's not just about giving things away. The money can help consecrate the church, right? Give this away too. Or sell it, if you like. - You don't want it? - No! It was Pfaff's. You remember Pfaff, right? Nusu's back. Go surprise him. My God, what's wrong with her? We don't know. She's gone to confession. She's taken communion. Could you talk to your husband? Maybe you can convince her to stay here and rest. We don't really have room now. Hurry, Papa. We have to go. - Did Alina tell you? - Tell me what? - She's moving to the monastery. - Yes. And she wants her money. The money I set aside. Forget about the rest. It was for safekeeping. Now you're giving it away as alms? What about that land you wanted to buy? I don't need it anymore. You wanted to build a house for you and your brother. Better it go to the church for a good cause. Mother, forgive me, but this isn't right. We never asked her for anything. She does whatever she decides. Alina, have you thought about your brother? You can't love anyone more than God if you want his love in return. Give this to some kid. What are you saying, child? In a family, everyone has to contribute, right? When I stayed here, didn't you charge me rent? It was hardly anything. It's a shame to lose your job in Germany. I've already lost it. You're not the monastic type. You're hot-tempered and moody. You love hot showers! Give us the money. It's getting late. Go get her money. Go on and take her, Mother... if this is what she wants. I'll take her along, but Father will decide. Hurry, Papa Nu?”- Five hundred euros. What? There's 800 in the bank, we lent 2,000 to Uncle Sandu for his operation, and 500 went to the hospital for you. For your medicine. What medicine? We had to pay for medicine, doctors, gas to go see you every day - Hold on. You gave them my money? - I gave it to your brother. He and that gentleman came asking for money for you. Five hundred euros? He wanted more, but I was wary and only gave him 500. I don't know all the details, but it was all spent on her. You take it, Mother. Here are some apples. And a picture to remember us by. Hello. - Is this her? - Yes. - You like my room? - Sorry? Make sure they don't cheat you. See you. Father... they're back. Good evening. - Bless you, Father. - Bless you. Bless you. I sent you there with instructions. I know, but there was no way. She decided to give everything away to come here. God has a plan for her, and he's testing you, Father. Aren't you coming to bed? No. Voichit_a, let's get out of here. And go where? Anywhere away from here. Why did you come back if that's how you feel? You plan to spend your whole life in this rat hole? This is my home now. What are you afraid of? Life? Father told us a parable once about one man who wandered the world for years to find the meaning of life and another who stepped out his front door and found God and peace. Enough of this God of yours! God this, God that! It's like Father's talking, not you. Alina, if you want to stay here... you need to give up this anger and this attitude. God won't enter an angry heart. Can't you talk like a normal person anymore? And how is that? Spouting profanities and gibberish? What did you say to Antonia? - Nothing. Alina... it would do you so much good if you could just believe. But I do believe. When I was all alone, I prayed to God every day to bring you back to me. I don't understand why he won't. God gives us what we need, not what we want. But I need you! Let's go to bed. I want to be alone tonight to pray. Then go and leave me alone. I'll pray to your God to guide your thoughts. I will too. He's out of the country? I see. Please tell him when he returns that I'd like to come talk to him. Whenever he has time. Thank you. God bless you. What did the bishop say? He won't come to consecrate the church until it's painted. Father, people come to church for you, not for the paintings. But it's gone unconsecrated for so long. Don't provoke God's anger. More people attend church here on the hill than in the village. I want the church to be full, and it will be. I think when people see what faith in God can achieve, the bishop will take notice. May God help you, Father. Stay and eat with us. I have things to do. Enjoy your meal, and God bless. God bless you. Where's Alina? She's praying in the church. Praying? It's time to eat. She said she's on a total fast. She's been praying since last night. Who gave her permission? Go tell her we fast when it's prescribed, not when we choose. Father, she's gone behind the altar! She's not herself! Alina, what are you doing? Did you go behind the altar? That's a very serious sin. - Why? Why? It's a grave sin! You realize what you've done? I only asked God to grant my wish. He won't if you go behind the altar! Is it true there's an icon there that grants wishes? - Who told you that? - I did. She said you saw an angel and that there's a miraculous icon. One who has faith doesn't need icons to believe. But I really need it, Father. You still can't go back there, for any reason! But the icon is there, isn't it? Of course. But that's no reason to go back there! You'll move to a new cell and say a thousand Hail Marys. Will you show it to me? - What? - Please show me the icon. Go begin your penance, and don't leave your cell until you finish! - There's nothing back there, right? - You hear me? Go! You're not allowed back there, you hear me? There's nothing there, is there? Why do you lie to them? You like keeping her here, right? - No one's keeping me here! - Shut up! You don't fool me! Why did you take my money? What have you done with my money? Can't answer, can you? Think I'm like these stupid crows? Show me if there's anything to show! There's nothing there! What's this? Think you can fool me with this? God bless. Sister, go help the lady while we finish here. Please wait outside. We'll begin in a minute. Father, more people are coming! Have them wait in the kitchen. Why? Let them come in! Get your hands off me! Want to fuck me like you fuck these dykes? Get out of this church. Get out! Let the people in. She screamed that she'd kill us, and she threw us out! She said she won't live like an animal in a stall. She's coming here if Father won't go talk to her. - I told her he's holding services. - She swore at us! Here she comes! Close the door so no one sees! She's coming this way! Go get Sister Hristina to calm her down! She's ringing the bell! She says she wants to talk to you! Step outside, Sister. Papa, don't lock her in! Pack your things. Enough is enough. Go in the church. Mama, where are we supposed to go? We have nowhere to go. I understand, but she can't stay here any longer. But Mama! To throw her out into the street? Sister. Speak to Father. He cares for you a great deal. Ask him to perform the service. What service? To cast out evil spirits. With God's help he may banish the Evil One. If she'd walk the right path, Father would gladly let her stay. But you can see that things can't go on like this. If Father performs the service, she'll get better? That's in God's hands, but if Father dares to try, I think he'll succeed. He has great power. Ask him. Father, if we don't help this girl, she'll be lost. Do you know what you're asking? I've put all my faith in God to help her... because I don't know what else to do. You can't stay here any longer. But my life has no meaning anywhere else. Isn't there somewhere else we could send her? Like where? Back to that family - They already took another girl in her place. Doesn't she have any relatives? Her mother's alive... but she left her at the orphanage and washed her hands of her. They won't keep her at the hospital. And the orphanage? Once you've left there, you can't go back. We can't kick her out in the street. Of course not. But we can't go on like this. People come here to see the light, and Easter's coming, and the Enemy's right in our church! Father... read the special prayers for her to escape the Evil One. - One priest can't do it alone. - I know. Father, don't send us away. We have nowhere else to go to ask for help. We need her family's consent. This is a big decision. She has no family. - There's her brother. - Oh, Father... Go get him. Ionut. Father wants to see you. Good evening, Father. God bless you. Ionut, listen carefully. This is about your sister. She's very troubled, and we can't keep her here. She's upsetting everyone around her. We either leave her in a hospital or we perform a special service to cast out the evil, with God's help. You must decide for her, since you two have no parents to decide. Ionut, do you understand what Father is asking? You must decide what to do with your sister. It's no use, Father. Let him answer. Ionut... shall we read special prayers to deliver Alina from evil? Ionut, let Father read the prayers. It may bring her peace. We'll all pray tonight that God guide our thoughts, and tomorrow we'll decide what to do. Yes, Father. May God help us. May God help us. “All your commands are truth. Help me, for men persecute me without cause. They almost wiped me from the earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts -” Come quickly! She's smashing everything in the cell! God save us! Go get Father! Sister Antonia's gone to get him. She set fire to the cell trying to get out the window! Get the other keys! Give me that! Mother, tell everyone we're on a total fast starting now! We have to read over her if we want to deliver her from evil! To the church! We must start before people arrive. - Will she stay there? - If not, tie her up! - Has she calmed down? - Do we take her to the service? Do we take her tied up like that? Will you behave? If not, we can't untie you. Father spoke to Ionut. He'll perform the service so you'll be delivered from the Evil One and gain peace. Will you come along quietly on your own? If not, we have to keep you tied up. Help me untie her. Give her some water. It's on the table. Lift her up carefully. Careful the rope doesn't cut her. Have you calmed down? Dear Lord, Alina! Let's not offend God any further. I'll kill you! - Is anyone coming? - No. What are you doing? Mama's orders. Bring a basin. Here. - You have nails? - Yes. Bend them over. Bring her out. People will be arriving for the service. Calm down. Put her down now. Careful! - She won't stay! - She has to or we can't read! Put her on the board now. Strap her down with this. Other way. This is too short. Take this one. Tie her legs with this. I need one too! - How do I tie her up? - Not like that. Then how? We need another plank this size. Hurry! Will these do? - This is good. - Hurry up! Slide this underneath. Hold her! Pass me a hammer! - This won't work. - Lift her up! Let her down slowly. - Tie her down! - These won't hold! Let's try rope! - No, it will cut her! Where did you put those chains? - They're in the doghouse. - Get them, quick! The locks too! Hurry! Give them here! Bind her wrists carefully so it doesn't cut her. My Lord! Calm down! Give me one! This one's no good! Are you all right, Mother? Yes. Let's finish here. Calm down, Alina! We're doing all this for you! Father's going to read for you soon, and you'll feel much better. - Mother, people are arriving! - Good Lord! Dear Lord! Open the window so she can hear the service. Go outside and tidy up. - Let's bring her a blanket. - It's warm enough in here. You should go lie down a bit. Calm down, Alina. We'll take you into the church soon. Be good and listen to the service. She's calmed down. Lord, have pity on her. Let's go. “Lord, make this oil a mighty shield against all things diabolic, the joy of souls and eternal happiness.” Put something under her arms. “For you alone can deliver us... now and forever and ever, amen.” The poor thing! How the Evil One torments her! Remove the gag when I tell you. “Lord, you gave us your cross as a weapon against the devil. He quakes and flees in terror at the sight of it. Holy Father, doctor of our bodies and souls, who sent your only son, our Lord God Jesus Christ, to cure all our ills and ransom us from death, heal your servant Alina.” I'll kill you, Papa! Yes? Mother, I think she's wet herself. Don't worry. We'll wash her. Does she have to be tied down? We'll untie her when Father feels she's calmed down. She could get sick! Don't worry. She'll be fine. She didn't eat anything yesterday. We can't give her anything now. It will just empower the Evil One, and we need to weaken him. How long will it take before she's healed? Only God knows. For some it's quicker. For others it takes longer. I can't bear to see her tied up like that. We're not the ones harming her. We're fighting the enemy that torments her! It's him screaming and shouting and trying to frighten us. Now stop fussing so... or you'll rob us of the strength we need. We're doing this for you and for her, not for us. Now go heat some water. Oh Lord! My dear Alina! The poor thing knows we're trying to help her. Of course she knows. When she's in her right mind, she knows. When the Evil One works through her, she's lost. He makes her do evil. We'll change you now, and you'll be clean. You can't stand before God in this state. You have to fight too, Alina. Father will read the prayers, but if you don't fight, it's pointless. Calm down, Alina! You've done so well this far. Calm down, Alina! Sister, leave right now! Go to the church and pray! Sister! Leave right now! That's enough, Alina! Don't be frightened! It's the Evil One screaming through her! Where does he go when he leaves a person? No one knows. He goes where he finds weakness, and there he makes his home. Hurry and read, Father, so this can be over. Calm down, Alina. “God of gods and Lord of lords, grant that this curse pronounced in your holy name terrify this counselor of wrongdoing. I curse you, source of all evil and calumny, progenitor of malevolence! Be banished from this servant of God, Alina! Be afraid, be gone, and depart, you unclean and despicable devil...” The poor girl must be paying now for some sin she committed. I feel so sorry for her. Where's Alina? We put her in the font room while we clean up here. Isn't it cold in there? It's warmer than here. I lit a fire. Just a minute. What is it? Mother and Father are starting to wonder about you. About me? You seem doubtful and agitated. They're worried about you. Why would they be worried? I don't know. I'm just telling you. Give it some thought. Just a moment, Sister. I spoke to Mother Superior. We decided it's best you not come while we read over Alina. Why, Father? You don't seem strong enough for this trial. The Enemy is well-armed now, and he's ready to attack those who seem weakest. Go stand at the gate and let us know when people start arriving. Go on now. - God bless you. - God bless you, Sister. Would you know of any land for sale around here? There, beyond the hills. Thank you. Good-bye. Let me go! Leave, Alina. Sister! Sister! - Come quickly! Alina's recovered! - What is it? She's recovered! Thank God! She's calm and she recognizes us. She's asking for you. Bring some water. Go tell Father. I'll go get Mother. Where's Alina? They took her into the church. I already gave her some water. - How is she? - Very calm. Praise the Lord! Are you okay, Alina? Shall we go? She asked for Voichit_a. She'll be fine now. Lay her down! Give her some room. - She's not breathing well! - Untie that! Mother, listen to her heart. She's passed out! Let's call an ambulance! - Who spoke to her earlier? - Pahomia. She said she was calling for Voichit_a. Give me that icon. Pass me that water. Take this. She's breathing! - Is she diabetic? - No. Her calcium level might have dropped. Tell Mr. Valerica to call an ambulance! Clean and change her. She can't go like this. Careful. - Hello. Where is she? - In the church. - What happened? - She fainted this morning. Give us room, please. She's so young! When did she faint? This morning. What are these from? She was agitated and hurt herself. - And her mouth? - She didn't drink enough water. She was on a total fast. Who spoke to her last? Sister Pahomia spoke to her this morning. She was thirsty. I gave her some tea. Quiet, please. It's around three, Doctor. - Can't you give her something? - Some calcium? - In the ambulance. - There'll be trouble if we take her like this. Please just do something! What can we do now? Please take her to the hospital! Quickly! Turn the car around. Help me lift her. Careful with her head. - Prepare some adrenaline. - Let me through. You have her ID? Make way, please. Out of the way! Down the hall. Careful. - Wait over there. What did you give her? - Adrenaline, five vials. - Why so much? - Her vital signs were weak. Can't you see she's dead? She's so young! We thought maybe you could do something. Like resurrect the dead? We thought she might - You thought! Now the hospital has to explain. - I told you. - You wait outside. See how her teeth are clenched? Try to open her mouth. She's been dead for - - She spoke this morning. Oh, yeah? Come here. What did you do to this girl? - Nothing. - Then why is she dead? Dear God! She was alive when they took her in the ambulance. - You see? - To show we were doing everything - - She spoke to us this morning! - Come on, lady! Why all those injections on the way if she wasn't alive? See? Now it's your fault. What happened to her wrists? She was agitated and having fits - - Why not bring her to the hospital? - We did. Dr. Solovastru said we should take care of her. - You certainly did! - You think we meant her harm? Then why's she dead? People her age don't just drop dead! - She was tied up - - Tied up? She tried to set herself on fire! So you tied her up? They tied her up here too! She was very violent! And you were gentle as lambs! You'll go to prison for this! What you did is a crime. We only wanted the best for her. Yeah, I can see that! And I'll tell everyone: the police, the press. God help anyone who falls into your hands! The same might be said of doctors - Get back in the other room! Come fill in these forms. Write this down: “I found the patient deceased with rigor mortis set in, with lesions on her arms and legs.” Got that? - Yes. “Lips cracked, jaw stiff and immobile...” Don't go praying for me, you hear? I'd sooner go to hell than have you pray for me. - Shall I sign it? - Magda? I'm doing awful! No, Matei's fine. He's scheduled for 4:15. I'll call when I'm downstairs. Don't get him anything. The house is full of toys already. Listen, I have a case of violent death here. She was brought here from the monastery. Give me her ID. Ringhia, Alina. Resident of Sinteati, Buzau County. Twenty-five years old. Dead for some time now. Two nuns brought her in. Should I keep them here? Okay. Bye. May God rest her soul. Ionut. They want everyone present. Is everyone here? Yes. So you conducted this service in the font room? No, in the church. Show me exactly where. She lay there as I read. What did you read? The prayer of St. Basil and some other prayers. And she listened quietly? The nuns were at her side. You held her by the arms? She was laid out on some boards. How? Show me. Like this, but laid out on boards. What boards? We brought her here on some boards. Bring them so I can see. Go get them. Did you hold her down during this service? She was tied down. You tied her down? She was thrashing about. We were scared she'd hurt herself. What was wrong with her? I don't know. She was very troubled. - She saw Satan! - She heard voices! I don't know where a girl like that got such strength! She did karate at the orphanage. How do you know? We were classmates from first grade on. She came to visit her. That's how the trouble began. Good Lord! You tied her to that? Yes. Don't damage this. It's evidence. All right? What did you tie her with? Towels with chains on top. You tied her to a cross with chains? What cross? It looks like a cross to me. The cross is a sacred thing! She was harming herself. We had to tie her down. She tried to throw herself down the well. She threatened to kill us! We gagged her so she'd stop shouting. She was only bound while we read over her. Where was she after that? In the font room, where we showed you. - And she stayed of her own accord? - No, she was still tied up. How long was she tied up? First time we read over her was Thursday, right? Yes. - Did you give her water? - Mostly holy water. And food? Some tea and bread yesterday, but she didn't want it. Why does this cross smell so bad? We tried to keep her clean, but it was a long time. Father... this looks bad. False imprisonment resulting in death. You could get 20 years. My God! What for? We were praying for her for her own good! Sure, but you can't tie people up like that. She nearly set herself on fire. We had to! They tied her down at the hospital too! This isn't a hospital. We tend to people here too. No one's saying it was intentional, but we all have to pay for our mistakes. Sure, if mistakes were made. What do you mean, Father? The girl is dead. People don't die from prayers or from being tied down. Then why did she die? That's for you to find out, though it seems you already know. What's to find out? You had her tied up. What about a doctor who has to force a child to take medicine? A child is a different story. - She was just like a child. - But she wasn't your child. She had no one else to look after her. No relatives? She has a brother. We talked to him, but he's sort of- Your realize the girl may have been sick? Of course. - Why didn't you take her to the hospital? - We did! They gave her right back to us. You thought you could cure her. Not of the disease. That's a doctor's job. I tried to cure the underlying cause. Not every sickness is in the flesh and bones, you know. And yesterday morning she was finally at peace. You can't imagine what she was like before. Father, I'm asking you: Was there someone at fault in this girl's death? Only God knows. He alone makes no mistakes. The rest of us make mistakes. Perhaps I'm at fault too, for believing too much in my own abilities and proving unworthy. Father, we won't resolve this talking. Let's go to the station. You can tell the prosecutor everything, and if you can convince him, fine. I've done my part. Fine. Let's go. We need others who were present to come along. Sister, give Mr. Valerica what we set aside for the orphanage. Yes, Mother. Who else was present? Let's have those who tied her up come along. That's enough for now, right? - Yeah. We'll see later. - Should we bring anything? - No. May I come too? If you like. You'll need your IDs. Sister, go get them. Don't be afraid. God knows we never meant any harm to anyone, Father. You seem frightened. No, I'm not frightened, Father. If God is with you, there's nothing you need fear. - Shall we? - Yeah. Mind if I smoke? No, go ahead. We'll have to wait for the prosecutor to get back. I'm gone a minute and you light up. I thought you'd be longer. No, the prosecutor left for a crime scene. A boy stabbed his mother and posted pictures on the Internet. - God help us! Today? - This morning. His cousin called the station an hour ago. It's one tragedy after another these days. Hello? Yes, sir. We're right outside. Yes, it needs a wash. It's really filthy. Yes, I'll do that. Good-bye. Will this winter never end, Captain? It'll pass, Vasile, it'll pass. The asphalt will be ruined by then! That's how it goes. Yeah, but still...
