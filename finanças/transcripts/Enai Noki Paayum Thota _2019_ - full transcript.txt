Where is the gun? It's in the dash-board. Wait, I'll go get it. Hurry up! How long will you take, moron? Damned brother of mine! This is all because of you. My brother is the reason I'm staring at the face of death today. I'll finish him off now? You won't ask me to drag him around again? For forty seconds now, he's been pointing that gun at me. He’s on a power trip. I’ve laughed at men like him in movies who point a gun and yap instead of shooting. But now, I'm not complaining. Because I'm in no mood to die today. It's not a good day to die. Though I'm not a believer, since my mother forced me... I showed my palm to a famous palm-reader. 'You will live a long and healthy life till you are 90 years old.', he said. Let's get this over with. Mr. Astrologer... if I die today, I want my money back. And you will be dead meat too. Back me up, guys. He's hit me. Grab him! Don't let him get away! Don't do this. Listen to me. Listen... It's not loaded? Gotcha! I'll kill you. Don't hit me! Our home has just not been the same. We've just not been the same... ...ever since my brother left us. All our happiness and laughter left with him. When he just got up and left, without even looking back. We loved him so much. But ever since he left, I hate him just as much. It's been fourteen years since I last spoke to him. Brother... Because of you, that bullet is coming at me. 'A BULLET WITH MY NAME ON IT' I want to see my brother. I came here in search of him... to this stinky city I hate. Lekha. My girl. My life. She was my everything. It's been 4 years since I last saw her. It's been 4 years since she left me. She randomly called me and said, 'I am with your brother...' 'He is in trouble. Can you get here now?' And so I came here for you, brother. Now I'm here. I think I'm going to die, because I can see my life flash before my eyes. Brother, I can't always remember your face. And I can't remember it now. Me, Saranya and Thiru. Saranya was born two minutes before me. My elder sister. Thiru was seven years older than both of us. My older brother. Between the ages of 7 and 10... for both Saranya and I , our brother was our whole world. He was our hero. After that he was never with us. He fell in love with a girl at 16. For two years. He would spend every waking minute with her. One day... the girl died. She was riding with Thiru on his motorcycle. He was eighteen then. According to him, that was the end of his life. He was at a vulnerable age. Or maybe that's just how he was. Not more than two months later, he left us. He just walked away. My mother and father went in search of him. No matter how hard they tried, he wouldn't return. He told them he wanted to be left alone. They have just not been the same ever since. The rest of our lives became all about hoping for Thiru to return someday. Somehow, somewhere, we would hear about him. That's all. At 11, I couldn't comprehend why he left us. I didn't like it. I despised him for leaving. I'm 25 years old today. He is 32. I didn't imagine in my wildest dreams... that I'd come to know about Thiru's whereabouts through Lekha... and come here to Mumbai. I'm not sure if he even remembers me. Hello, brother. My name is... Raghu. Come to think of it... My story begins with Lekha. It happened five years ago... this love story. Life begins because of love. When we're in love, it does something to us. Without it, we can't do a thing. I think Lekha came into my life... just so I could meet my brother again, after all these years. I was in my final year of college when I first met her. I wanted to study Mechanical Engineering. But my dad said computers were the future... and made me study Computer Science and Engineering. I wish she had just been my classmate or something. Raghu? What's an EPROM, Raghu? I don't know, sir. They're shooting a movie outside. Get out and watch that instead. She wasn't my classmate. Nor my lecturer. She wasn't my senior. Nor my junior. I knew you'd come. Hurry up. Where to? To see the kind of beauty that's never been seen here before. What? Do you know what 'divine' means? I'll show you just what it means. Our college was well funded. Students paid a lot as capitation fees. A beautiful campus. But they wanted to make more money. They decided to rent it out for movie shoots. Every other week, movie shoots would happen. Look, she's coming out. 'Man, life is rather mundane; Education is no fun.' 'Nothing lush for the eyes to see; The air is still, no hint of a breeze.' There were 1,200 students in college. But my face was the first one she set her eyes on. It started right there. She was the heroine of the movie they were shooting. I liked her the second I saw her. I think she liked me too. 'What's a lotus doing outside it's pond? Won't her feet scar from walking on ground?' 'What's a masterpiece doing outside it's frame? Did a million hues blend to make this dame?' Roll camera... and action! Jib down. You see the hero approaching. Wave at him. Cut it. Shot okay. You know the introduction shot for Rose in Titanic? Yes. - It's the exact same shot. A total rip-off! 'Oh, I'm panting! Will I survive this? I'm running a fever over 100 degrees.' 'Thinking of her makes my mind all groovy; Each day passes like a scene from a movie.' 'A thousand roses won't suffice; A love like this will wash away sins.' What's with the green background screens? Looks ugly! That won't be there in the movie. They will change it. I bunked classes to look at her all day. In a nice way, of course. 'Every morning, when I rise; The image of her fills my eyes.' 'I'm a brand new person now; An unfamiliar man I'm just getting to know.' 'Where was this flower garden all this time? Why has it suddenly sprung into my life?' 'The very prospect of looking at your face, Shakes my heart with sweet tremors.' She looked at me a couple of times. She caught me looking at her a couple of times. One time, her eyes searched for me. Holy Mother of God! Are you stupid? Go to the caravan. 'Oh, I'm panting! Will I survive this? I'm running a fever over 100 degrees.' 'Thinking about her makes my mind all groovy. Each day passes like a scene from some movie.' 'Why is it that, every time I see you; I see my whole life flashing in episodes?' 'When I go home, there's your face again; Why do you come, just to drive me insane?' She looked at me when she walked in. She had no choice. She ordered a rose milk and stood at the table next to mine. Gosh! The girl and the rose milk! That was my chance. I went and spoke to her. Hi... Is it a period film? Obviously! I meant... is the entire film set in period or do you also have a modern look? The entire film. You must be what... 18 or 19 years old? If you don't mind telling me. I'm 19. 19! You're not interested in acting? It's very obvious. Don't disturb her. She came here to relax. - I'm sorry. It's okay, Kishore. You may leave. Let me know when the shot is ready. Okay, madam. Sorry. That 'sorry' had so much meaning to me. 'O Silver Moon! Just stolen glances won't sate a man.' 'If I were to beckon you, Would you flat refuse?' 'Like the most precious of diamonds; I string together the right words.' 'We can't carry on wordlessly; This unbroken ice will drive me crazy.' They shot in our college for 80 days over the next 6 months. One day, just like that, I turned around to find her standing next to me. Needless to say... she looked even more beautiful up close. Everyone was watching the hero. No one paid any attention to her. They were fools. Good for me. Do you have a motorcycle? Sorry? - I need to get out of here. Please help me. What? Do you have a motorcycle? I really need to get out of here. That's Vasanth. He will take you wherever you need to go. The motorcycles are parked over there. Okay? Thank you! Vasanth, like in the climax of a film... got to ride away with the girl. 'Never a good time to confess my love...' Where did you drop her? Near the first toll. She called someone on the phone to come get her. When we reached, there was a car already waiting. Then she got off my motorcycle and got into the back-seat of the car. Off she went! She didn't thank you? - She did! She even asked, 'What's your name?' Now, that I did not see coming. Did she ask for 'my' name? Or 'your' name? 'Who's the other guy? Your friend? What's his name?' I said your name is Raghu and you don't have a phone. Why? Dude, you handed her over to me on a silver platter. I can still feel her hand on my shoulders. And on my back, her... I thought you weren't interested. So I gave her my number. Did you offer your number, saying, 'Here is my number.' Or did she say, 'Okay, give me your number.'? Why are you so jealous? - Dude... I'm asking for a reason. Tell me the truth. The truth is, she wanted my number. It was her. Just as I expected. Hello? - Hi, Vasanth! Hey, this is Vasanth! Is your friend Raghu around? Can I talk to him? Yeah, this is Vasanth. The signal is poor here... Okay, let me talk when you're done? She asked for me, right? Hello? Hello, this is Raghu. Hi, Raghu! I am right outside your hostel. Only when the girl takes one step, can the boy take the next three steps. Raghu. Hi! So you're such a good guy? The world's most beautiful girl asks you to take her on a ride... and you send someone else? Are you really that decent, or just scared? Or is it something else? How did you get in? At the security gate... The driver said, 'I've brought money for Raghu from Final Year.' And we just hid. Fine, where is the money? Raghu, come with us. She wants you to come with us because you helped her. If they hadn't come to get me... 'Freak out! Oh, yeah…' 'Freak out! Oh, yeah…' 'Freak out! Oh, yeah…' 'Freak out! Oh, yeah…' Surprise! Happy birthday. 'Don't you steal it, don't you steal it! I need my heart, mister.' 'Don't taunt me, don't taunt me! Your gaze sets me on fire.' 'My poor soul, my pure soul; Why should it get tainted?' 'And yet, when you inch closer; My heart goes cray cray crazy!' 'I'm biting my fingers; I'm holding back my thoughts.' 'I try to play it cool; But really, I'm dying inside.' 'It's night already? I didn't know; Is the moon up? I just didn't know.' 'Hell could break loose out there; But I really wouldn't know.' 'Are the doors open? I didn't know; Is the wind blowing? I didn't know.' 'Someone could just rob us blind; And yet, I wouldn't even know.' So what's her story? We are friends from school. From 3rd grade till high school. We graduated last year. We are all she has. She doesn't have parents. One Mr. and Mrs. Kuberan are her sponsors. Basically they paid her fees on time, and gave her financial assistance since childhood. He is a film producer these days. And a director. He has forced her to act in this movie. She is acting because she has no choice. We planned this party for her birthday. But Mr. Kuberan refused to let her go, he said she has to shoot. He’s a real mean guy. He is also being a little inappropriate with her. She doesn't like it one bit, obviously. You helped her get away from the shoot. She kept talking about you. She said it would be nice if you came to the party. That's why we kidnapped you! 'I see you everywhere; What's wrong with my eyes?' 'In my dreams I see your smile; With eyes like an angel.' 'I don't know what to say; So I just laugh along.' 'Whatever this leads to; I've decided that I'm game.' 'I read the secret language of your eyes; I get all your tastes.' 'I know I'm losing myself; And yet, I'm letting it happen.' 'Can I come closer now? Do I have your consent?' 'I want to hold you, girl; Is that so bad?' 'It's night already? I didn't know; Is the moon up? I just didn't know.' 'Hell could break loose out there; But I really wouldn't know.' 'Are the doors open? I didn't know; Is the wind blowing? I didn't know.' 'Someone could just rob us blind; And yet, I wouldn't even know.' 'Bounce! Gotta party.' 'Bounce! Gotta party.' 'Bounce! Gotta party.' 'Bounce! Gotta party.' You stay in the hostel? - Yes. Where are you from, Raghu? Pollachi. The other day, you had asked me… You're right. I have no interest in acting. I don't like it one bit. I hate it! Just this one film. I can't wait for it to finish. Your first film, right? Your debut launch? Yeah, just this one film. That's all. I'll just run away. A girl like you is worth launching a fleet of thousand ships. I went overboard, didn't I? Yes, it was a tad filmy. Well, with the sea out there... I thought of ships. I remembered reading 'Cleopatra'. He was right. Talented fellow! Who, Shakespeare? My friend, Vasanth. The one who dropped you. What did he say? He said... He said you are divine. I've never gone after pretty girls before. But now... I can't get past your face. You're kind. Just stating the truth. One glorious hour. We stood there talking to each other. Who are you? What's this place? Who are you? Where is Lekha? Oh shucks, oh my god! Where is Lekha? - I don't know. Actually, I don't even know what I am doing here. Don't act smart. Where is Lekha? Poor Lekha. She got scared. She thought I was done for. Before she could reach downstairs... What are you doing, Pandian? I was done with them. What's your problem? I'm right here! I'll come in an hour. I'm here with my friends. I liked her spunk. Mr.Kuberan told me to take you to the hotel right away. You need to sleep early. You have to shoot in the morning. Even today, it got messy because you left. I'll sleep or I won't sleep. Tell him not to worry about that. Why are you behaving like a thug? Like he is some mafia don! I said I'll be there in an hour. Now, leave! No, ma'am. Get in the car. Pandian, please! Get in the car, ma'am. You hit me! Pandian! Let's go. I realized it was always going to be like this. Beautiful, just like her... but it was never going to be easy. Bring it on! Death gave me a hi-five and whizzed past me. That bullet reached only up to the buckle on my belt. It didn't hit me. But I didn't get even a couple of seconds to relish that, or give my thanks to God. Where are you hiding? He doesn't leave from here alive. That way! Behind the junction box. Don't act smart. Where is Lekha? I felt a change from within when he hit me. I felt a rage. That was the first time I got hit... and it was the first time I hit back. That day, I had no fear. I just took those guys on like... it was a walk in the park. Pandian! Next day, three of them came to the college canteen looking for me. It was all over in 10 seconds. Not for me. But for them. Dude! What happened? Who are these men? They're from the film crew. How did you even enter the college? - We had a brawl last night. Get out. I used the opportunity to call her. At the canteen. They came to hit me. I hit them. Listen... Whoever these men are, just let them know... I don't wish to fight with them or beat them up. Tell them to back off. Or this doesn't look like it will end. Fine, forget about that. Can I meet you? I want to see you. When? Now. Where? Do you know AVM Studios in Vadapalani? I don't. - You don't? Find out and get here. Bye! She was real sassy. Hi. Hi! Sorry. He shouldn't have come looking for you. I don't know why they behaved that way. Another fight? Are you okay? I wish I had bruises on my body to show her. But... if they hadn't come, you wouldn’t have called me, huh? I was only waiting for an excuse to call you. So it's a good thing they came. I know! That's why I sent them. You are kidding me! I wouldn't put you through all that. I was just kidding. Sit. From the start, I felt easy and comfortable around her. That's how she was. Is it okay to be here? No trouble, right? This is a movie set. Not some gangsters' den. Yeah, right. No, with that... I am the problem. My karma. I feel there is this bad energy around me. So don't just turn up whenever I call you. Shall I leave, then? You ask me to come here, but now you're saying weird things. You said you're 19 years old? You talk about Karma and energy at your age... It's a little scary! Kishore? Madam, the director is coming. Watch out. Raghu, come. She held my hand like it was the most natural thing to do. She opened another door... took me in... and shut the door. And I looked around... it was smaller than my hostel bathroom. And that's the day I stepped into her life. I never quite managed to step out. Yes, sir? - Oh, you're in the bathroom? Kuberan, the producer and director. That was my first encounter with him. He and I had our little caravan bathroom scene. I got several phone calls. I met a very special person. Guess who? Director Shankar! You know what he said? 'Exquisite!' Both, you, and the trailer. You do know what that means? I had to look up the meaning in a dictionary. Ex-qui-site. He thinks you're gorgeous! - Sorry. He wants you to act in his next film. But I told him we're starting another film immediately with you. I hate him. From the bottom of my heart. - Lekha, one minute... He paid for my education. And said, I am indebted to him. He said it would be just this one movie. He keeps going back on his word. That's what I hate. Now he keeps talking about more films. And his intentions are not right. He touches me when he talks, Raghu. I don't like it. It's not a good touch. The way he looks at me... I don't like it. You're star material! You were so hesitant at first. I told you, you'd get used to it! You're going places! God, I wish he'd shut up. Wherever you go, I'll be there with you! What's taking you so long? I'm getting another call. Yes, sir? She was the sweetest. Softest. She was nervous. And scared. His words scared her. But that's not why it happened. I didn't want to do it when she was so vulnerable. I'm not depraved. I'm a good guy. But she didn't care about anything. I didn't care either. I made a home on her lips; For a good ten minutes. With closed eyes, her lips touched mine; I tasted life. He's gone. Let's leave? From that day, she took me into a state of trance. 'I love you.' There was no need to utter those three words. The actress in my arms, like a fan I swooned. That moment seemed like eternity. Was it a dream? A movie scene? Or reality? What was I experiencing? Was it her face? Her body? Or the warmth? What did I succumb to? I knew not. 'Dear Reality, Don't you fade away...' 'You're no Dream.' 'There are million different ways to part; But let us not...' 'I will tell you that way; That will bring us closer...' 'Come closer, a little closer; And I will tell you.' 'So come closer, my love.' 'Dear Earth, Don't you rotate now...' 'I live in this timeless, Surreal trance.' 'To savour those unfinished kisses; May this moment last...' 'May our time together; Stretch forever...' 'May our time apart; Be replaced with this moment...' 'I'm your everlasting path of flowers; You're the ceaseless wafting caress.' 'I'm the incessant music in your ear; You're my endless perennial river.' 'I'm your undying source of pleasure; You're my boundless lustful fire.' 'I'm the dream you dream wide awake; You're my constant even when away.' 'I'm the fragrance that makes your home.' You're the reason words soothe me.' 'I'm the one you crave at night; You're the secret I hold in my heart.' And thus... it began. My first hit. I killed a man. I killed a man. Yes, I killed a man. Shot him right in the face. There is no chance he will survive. When I fired, everybody else ran helter-skelter. And I ran the hell out of there too. I don't know what's going to happen next. I must get to Lekha. Note down my address. Come here now. Please. It's time. What are you doing? There is a lane opposite the Indian Bank in Malad. Walk into the lane. I'm already in a murderous rage. Come at me! What do you think you're doing? Just stop. You better watch out. I've got the girl. Thrash him, come on! What the hell are you doing? The only thought I had was, this was just like the fights kids have at school. Lekha, I don't want to see you. I don't want to look at you. I won't. Kill her. Why did you stop? Even with the ugly hand holding a knife at your neck... I know you'd look beautiful. I've survived being around that neck. For six months... Love, lust, romance. I'd never been that happy. I have to go. Don't ever say that. Don't go. Please! I'm done with the movie. I'm done with college. How have you fared? I will pass the exams. Are you going to study further? Masters? - No. Do a PhD. On me! I mean, about me! Come. Are you going to act in another movie? No. How are you going to manage? Doesn't look like your guy is going to let go of you. He is not my guy! I'm with my guy, sitting on his lap. I am not worried about him. I have no interest in acting. I don't want that. I'll handle him. Come home with me? No one needs to know. Don't tell anyone. I'll introduce you to my parents. And tell them, 'This is the girl I'm going to marry.' Do you really mean it? I wouldn't have said it otherwise. Raghu! Tell me... Is that it? So, we're just leaving... and never coming back? Or just for a few days? How many clothes should I pack? You will only need the saree you'll be wearing. You're telling me to wear a saree? 'Gosh, is this really me? I've scattered into a million pieces.' 'Hey Beautiful, it's only you; Who lives in my heart.' 'Light of my life, my breath of air; Don't walk away, I'm suffocating here.' 'All of my clothes are wet, Drenched in the rain of your sweat.' 'Is this the first chapter, or the last? Tell me, my first love.' 'Is all this true or just a mirage? Tell me, my true love.' Have a seat! Sit down, dear. Sit! Sit down. What's the deal, Raghu? Sorry, dad. I didn't tell you about this one thing. Her name is Lekha. I want to marry her. Someday. It will be nice if she can stay in our house until then. She has no one else. Mom, you do the talking. Please. No, you go on. You've said so much already. I'll talk to her. That's for sure. I've told you everything. You began with "I want to marry her". Did she study with you in college? No. They discussed it for 2 hours. And it's only fair. She was going to live with us, in our home, as another daughter to my parents. And be my wife. Obviously they would discuss it for at least two hours. They liked her. Because they really like me. 'How far do you wish to go? I ask, because I need to know.' 'You say you only want sweet kisses; I will stay within the confines.' 'Day after day, you star in the dreams; Of innumerable strangers.' 'And here I am, the one man; Who is the object of your dreams.' 'Dear Breeze, Will you stop blowing please?' 'Dear Breeze, will you stop blowing please? I want to be her only fan here.' 'You're standing here, in my home! Is this my imagination, I wonder?' 'You're standing there, in my garden! With all the flowers you blend right in.' 'Garlands and laurels, milk and honey; I've seen it all, but it's only you I fancy.' 'Riches and rewards, gold and glory; None of it matters, I'd choose you anyday.' 'My love!' 'All my wildness is a thing of the past; It's waned out to a sleepy little beast.' 'All of my rage is now turned to dust; That flies away in the gentlest gust.' 'The days we don't meet, the days we don't speak; Those are precious days gone to waste.' 'The days you're with me, the days you hold me; Those are the days I'm a happy lady.' 'My love!' 'How far do you wish to go? I ask, because I need to know.' 'You say you only want sweet kisses; I will stay within the confines.' 'Turning down a boy like you; Would be a stupid thing to do.' 'I have peered into your unblemished purity; My eyes feast on your masculinity.' 'Dear Breeze, Will you stop blowing please?' 'Dear Breeze, will you stop blowing please? I want to be her only fan here.' The most beautiful thirty days of my life. That was the beginning of the end. My name is Kuberan. Have a seat. Hello! I only need two minutes. I'll chat for a bit and take her away with me. Have a seat, sir. Your son didn't tell you that she is an actress? Do you know how much money I've invested in her? A lot. I just got a 2.5 million advance for her next film. Did you know, I'm the reason she has a good life? I found her on the streets. She doesn't even know her parents' names. I fed her, educated her, gave her a place to stay... made her an actress... that film is releasing today! I've been searching for 4 weeks. Your son has hidden her here. You may be able to give her a good life. I'm not denying it. But give her 5 to 6 years. Let her act in 10 to 15 films... and make me some good money... get it? Anyway these girls don’t get opportunities after that. If they are still in love... your son can marry her. I'll give my blessings. But not now. Just send her back with me, for your own good. The movie is releasing today. I have a lot of work. Go to your room, dear. Your daughter? She's pretty. Can she act? Since you have a daughter, I'm sure you'll understand. What's this? You could have told me before you sneaked her out here! We had to get the police involved. Finally, it was the police who found out Lekha's location. I didn't want to complicate things, so I retracted my case and got here. This is my town. Nobody can get in easily-- - Dad, there won't be any trouble. No one can take her away without her consent. He's making her act against her will. - Hey! What? I'll make your town come crumbling down. You will be humiliated. You take a girl away from my house? If this happened to your daughter, would you wave goodbye? Consent, my foot! Let's just ask her. She came with Raghu because she liked him. Boys like him will confuse her. But as elders, we should talk sense into them. I'm warning you... just send her with me. Hand her over to me. Or it will get ugly. Let's see what she says. - That doesn't matter! I'm not in the mood to give her a chance or choice. Don't tire me out. It's getting annoying. Sir... I'm a court-bird, sir. I've been to court several times. I've got so many enemies. So I carry a gun with me 24x7. I don't know why I brought that up! Just send her with me! I have so much work. I can't keep talking... Find her, guys. No need for that. What's this, Lekha? You've put on weight. Your director is going to be mad! No problem, we'll take care of that. Let's go. You never give these expressions in front of the camera. Come on, let's leave. I'm sorry. I've never been this happy in my life, ever. You took such good care of me. Thank you. I'm leaving now. What? Sir, we'll bring her. I'll go, Raghu. It's really okay. I'll go. Your parents don't deserve this. They don't need to hear this kind of talk. I'll talk to him and fix things. You come for me. I can't live without you, for a second. I'll be waiting for you. Come for me after five days. Okay? Sir, let's go. I'm sorry. She asked me to come after five days. Something didn't feel quite right. She never spoke to any of us after that. We tried calling her several times, the call didn't go through. She's not been responding. I have no clue what happened to her. She was staying in 301. She made it clear that she didn't want her old friends. She is a big star now. Get it? She asked me to come see her in 5 days. I'll leave only after meeting her. If you stay here another second, I'll hit you. I dare you to touch me. I'll kill you! She's been shooting in London for ten days. Want to see her? Go to Sathyam Cinemas. Her movie is playing there. She looked beautiful on screen. So beautiful. I couldn't stop looking at her. I went back the next day. And the next day. And the day after that. After a month, my parents came looking for me. I thought to myself, I shouldn't end up like my brother. I shouldn't do what my brother did to my parents. I did something that my brother didn't do. I dragged them into my love story when I took Lekha home. With Lekha gone... my mother's lap and my father's shoulders were my only source of comfort. It hurt like crazy. I just didn't get it. What happened to her? Why would she do such a thing? Why did she throw me away, just like that? I didn't get it. After that, she did five more movies. She became some sort of a star in Tamil Cinema. I read about her on the news or the internet. Sanjana would occasionally call me and talk about her. She told me she would never act after that one movie. But she did five movies after that. I didn't watch any of her other movies. Just her first movie. A hundred times at home. Hello? The moment I said 'Hello', I knew... it was her on the phone. Hello, Raghu? Raghu? Can you hear me? I got that call after 4 years. Tell me... Raghu... Please, listen to me. This isn't about you or me. I met your brother. Thiru. My brother? Yes. I met Thiru. What's the matter? I'm in Mumbai. I was with him. He saved me. Yes. That's exactly it. He saved me. Thiru is in big trouble here. I don't understand what's happening. He's been missing for 3 days. I haven't heard from him. Suddenly, he called me a while back and moved me to another place. Raghu... Thiru doesn't know that I have called you. I felt like I should ask you. Raghu... Can you come here? I don't get it. Raghu, it's crazy here. People keep coming here looking for Thiru. Police. And men who look like gangsters. I'm scared. Trust me on this. Come for him. Please. What does Lekha have to do with Thiru? I don't know. That was Lekha, wasn't it? Maybe... Maybe someone made her say that to make you come to Mumbai? Maybe that producer, Kuberan... - But dad, we left them alone. They don't even know Thiru. Nor do we! What do we do? You say Thiru is in trouble. You go, Raghu. Just see if he is doing okay. That's all I need to know. Meet him there... and bring him home. Both of you need to be here for Saranya's wedding. So that's how I got here. To this stinking city. A city I detest - Mumbai. When I met Lekha at the film shoot in college... Mythili had already graduated. She was a year senior to me. A good friend from college. Are you sure it's okay for me to stay here? People here won't judge? This is Mumbai, dude! Not a problem at all. Nobody cares. So, there are two keys to this place. You can come and go as you please. I was waiting for you... and I'm really late. I have to be at work by 10. I'm off now. Make yourself at home, okay? Yeah. Bye! - Bye. No, Raghu. Thiru got in touch with me. I told him I spoke to you. He wasn't too happy that I asked you to come here. But thank you for coming, Raghu. He told you to stay in a safe place and asked us not to meet now. What the hell is happening, Lekha? Raghu... You don't know, right? Thiru is a police officer. He is DCP Thirumal. Check yesterday's edition of Times Of India. The article maligns him. Please listen to me. Stay where you are. There is so much happening here, Raghu. Wait for my call, please. Don't go anywhere. Wait till we hear from Thiru. So, you're a police officer! Here in Mumbai. Not bad! I wasn't really surprised... But why are the police looking for you now? What happened? Are you a bad guy? Not bad. He got me a wee bit emotional! Excuse me? Who are you? How do you both speak Hindi so fluently? Your brother speaks really good Hindi too. We learnt it at school. In school? But people don't speak Hindi in Chennai, right? But it is taught anyway. Your brother is a good man. But he is in deep trouble. The police are after him. If someone here gets a whiff that you're looking for your brother... they will use you to get to him. Arun Bhide was Thiru's senior. What he just narrated is the plot of the movie 'Pokkiri'. Thiru was an undercover police officer. He said, after a three year police operation... the police are now looking for him... and the gangsters are also looking for him. Thiru's name in the gang was Raghu. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? He got me emotional again. Arun Bhide connected me with another gang member called Fenn. It was DCP Suraj who planted the mole in Lala's gang. But things went wrong when Lala tried to strike a deal with some cop. Your brother became the scapegoat. He narrated the same story but mentioned a lot of names. He told me about DCP Suraj. And a gangster named Lala. He said 'bechara'. It means 'poor guy'. Poor Thiru! Hello Raghu? Arun Bhide here. - Yes, sir? I just got to know your brother is in police custody. They are taking him to the Magistrate Court in Andheri in some time. I will be with him. You come there. I'll help you meet him, if possible. Call me once you reach. I went into auto-pilot mode. Nobody move. Step back, step back! Thiru, you never saw me. Thiru, don't run. Don't move! Don't move! Look over there. Thiru, stop! Thiru! I'll fix everything. Don't run or you will be shot! The next day, I had a few unexpected guests. One of them had that weapon from the movie 'Ghajini'. Are you sure he is Raghu's brother? He is like my brother. I'll talk. What's your name? Raghu. Raghu? So his name is your name? Don't create a fuss. Just come with us! You won't be harmed, I promise. I'm just going to use you to lure out your brother. Go, get in that vehicle. Madam, aren't you going to work? Don't think about going to the police. If you do so... I'll come and violate you before talking to you. Okay? You still haven't moved? Brother, you want to have a chat with her? Fine, make it quick. Let's go, guys. He will come. What is happening? Sit! There will be no trouble. Tie up his hands. They said the plan was to use me and lure Thiru out. I thought when Thiru gets there, he'd somehow save me... and we can leave together. But... everything changed suddenly, after that phone call. They decided to kill me... and got a gun out of nowhere. You took so long! Idiot. Thiru... Thiru! My damned brother... All because of you! Kill her. Why did you stop? Sit down. Stay still, don't move! I'll finish him first, and then come for you. Did that look easy? Only because it was me doing it! Actually, it wasn't that easy. Anyone who crosses me now... is a dead man. Lekha... I clearly remember what you said. That without me... You said you can't live even for a second without me. Four years have passed, Lekha. Without me. You made it alright. You got through without any trouble... except for these last few days. Empty words and broken promises, Lekha? How are you, Lekha? What's your story now? Exactly 72 hours later... a second bullet with my name came towards me. It killed me. I died. 72 hours ago... I met Lekha again, after such a long time. She and I, on the road. In an auto-rickshaw. So close to me. Go straight. Raghu... - Hey, what are you doing? Head towards Seven Bungalows. - What? Some passengers! My brother. How are you, Raghu? - Thiru. Are you alright? Did they hit you? Lekha? Did they hurt you? She is hurt. We need to get her to a hospital. - I'm okay. Thank God Raghu was there. - I know. I was on my way there. Sorry, Raghu. You went through a lot of trouble. You're okay? Everything fine with you? I'm sorry, my brother. Raghu... Does it hurt, Lekha? I'm okay. Where are we going? - Seven Bungalows. I have a place there. I'll arrange for a nurse to come there. We need to take care of that wound. Both of you stay put there till I tell you. Raghu, don't go anywhere. I'll come there for you. All the pain and anger I felt all these years... All the trouble and danger I was in that day because of him... it was all forgotten. How are Mom and Dad? They're okay. They are just longing to see you come home. They'll be alright if you come home and see them. Listen, I know you're in some big trouble. Let's go to the airport and get out of this place. I can't do that now. But I will come... in a few days. Is Saranya doing well? She is fine. It's her wedding in five days. On the 25th. They've forgotten me, haven't they? They must be angry, too. If only! They were never angry with you. They've only been waiting for you to come back home. Dad sent me here to bring you for our sister's wedding. It’s me who is angry with you. Sorry, I had to get it out. Raghu... I'm sorry. Life went by in a flash. And this big mess over the past three years. Now I'm stuck here. I don't know how long I can spend with you. The police... and some other people are looking for me. Till yesterday, they didn't know who you were. You stopped those men who attacked me at court. And you met Fenn just before. That's how they figured out I had a brother... and they decided to get you. Lekha is in trouble too, Raghu. Both of you stay at this place tonight. Tomorrow morning, take her with you to Pollachi. You shouldn't be here. Eight minutes with my brother, in a rickety auto-rickshaw. It was a lifetime for me. I know this isn't the right time. But I'm so happy to see you. Lekha... Raghu! Raghu? Lekha... Thiru! Thiru! Thiru! Get down! Down! Stay! Stay behind. Thiru, just like the hero he was, stood his ground, facing them. He didn't turn or run away. He took the bullet to his chest fearlessly and fell down. I really thought he will pull through. That he will win. I thought he would be okay. But the unthinkable happened. Raghu, don't... Don't... Drop your gun. Drop your gun. Raghu, is Thiru okay? Thiru... Raghu, please! Raghu! This feels bad, Raghu. - Don't speak! Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance. I will call. You will be okay. - I'll call. Raghu, I came to see you. I came to your college a few times. It was during your college culturals. I saw you. I was right there. You sang so well. I left after I watched you. I came to Pollachi, too. I saw our house, mom, dad... and Saranya. I watched them from a distance. It's been 3 years. I really wanted to... I always wanted to come back... but I couldn't. I made a mistake. I was on a death wish. I didn't care. But after seeing you now... I wish I could live longer. Raghu... I'm sorry, Raghu. He made me cry. My mind went blank after that for a long time. What happened? Is he alive? Are you hurt? He is badly wounded, we have to take him to the hospital. He is DCP Thirumal. I'm his brother. - We were looking for him! Please! He's been shot. - Get an ambulance, quick. Where were you? - Sorry, I was held up. What happened to my brother? Listen, the police will talk to you. Doctor! Sir, how is he? - You are his brother? Yeah. The doctors tried their best to save his life. But they couldn't. He was already dead when he arrived here. He was alive. You were both there on the flyover? - Yes, sir. I need a statement from you. You will have to come to the station with me. Now. Can I see him? No. He will be moved to another hospital for the post-mortem. Can I see him? I want to see him. He was a good man. Thiru was a good man. When the girl he loved died, something changed in him. He went away from us. Based on what he said... looks like he never went too far. He was around us, all along. But now... he's gone. Forever. We kept hoping he would return to us. Now he will never return. He won't be around us anymore. For some people, that is all that was written. Destiny. For him. For some others, there was not much more written either. For us. Big brother! Mom and Dad called for you. - Tell him I'm coming. Raghu, want to play with us? No. Fine! Tell him I'll be home in half an hour. Don't tell him where I am. Just say I'll be home soon. Okay, brother. I don't have to worry about Mom and Dad anymore. They will eventually learn that you are not there... and that I'm gone too. We never knew he had a family. Stop it! Not now. Take him to the back. Did he give you anything? Raghu, keep this with you. This is the key to a locker. I'll explain. You know, like a hard disk? No. Flash drive, SD card, memory card... something like that? Did he give you something like that? - We hardly spent 10 minutes together... that too, in an auto. Why do you ask? - Where were you going? I don't know. He was just giving directions. Did he give you something? You look familiar. I've seen you somewhere. What's your name? Niveditha. I should be the one saying that. I have seen you somewhere. It was you. You killed my brother and now you're just sitting there? I see the other guy's bloodstain on your jeans. So it's you, and one Lala. I'll kill you first! You are free to leave. Leave your address and go. They've given it, sir. Get going. When will I get my brother's dead body? In a couple of days. I'll let you know. I didn't ever want to step out into the world again. It was one of those days. I could have died. My brother died. Someone had to die today. It could have been me. Just his luck... he beat me to it. Raghu... What happened? I was scared to death. I called you several times! Lekha... Mythili. News just coming in... a shoot-out ensued at the Bandhra flyover... between masked gangsters and a police officer... a deputy commissioner with alleged links to the underworld. I'm so sorry. ...in the cross-fire, an auto driver was killed. The DCP was accused of having aided criminals in the underworld... there are also speculations that he was involved... in the cop killings that took place three years ago... when senior police officers Akshay Madhavan-- I couldn't bear to hear them label him as a corrupt cop. Did you inform your parents? If they watch the news they'll find out anyway. They won't watch all this. They have no one to tell them about this. They don't even know Thiru was a police officer. Tell me just one thing. How did you know my brother? How did he get here? Lekha! Raghu? Why are you scared? Go! Talk to him. He's your guy, afterall. He's come for you. Probably to act in his next film. Listen... Either go with him. Or ask him to leave. Let's not create any trouble here. This isn't our place. Go. Raghu, what are you doing? You don't know her. I'll tell her, 'Don't worry. I'm there for you.' Then I'll try to talk to them. But she'll say, 'No, it's okay. I'll go with them...' 'Come for me after a few days.' And then she'll never answer my calls. Four years and several movies later, when she is bored... she'll call me from somewhere else and I'll turn up for her like a dumb-ass. Right? Sometimes boys can be really insensitive, like monsters. I should have called you... I was that monster. ...and told you what was happening. But I couldn't do it... I was scared. Scared that he'd do something. Sorry, Raghu. He repeatedly threatened to harm Raghu and his family. Not just that. His wife's name is Kamala. I really like her. She came to the orphanage and cared for me like I was her own daughter. When I want something, it's her I ask. She chose everything for me. My school, my clothes. The day after I left Pollachi... Do this film now. Then act in his film. That would do. I'm here for you. I'll handle it. It's not so easy, aunty. I really don't like it. You said it would be just one film. Come here, boy. How much did you score in maths? I told you yesterday... Did you tell them? Forty. Forty out of hundred, huh? Mother! - I should hit you more often. He thrashed that 12 year boy so badly. I hit him because of you. Remember that! How could you go with that creep? You took me for a fool? She is going to get it from me! Come here. This is because of you, too. I told you to talk some sense into her. You don't get it? I'll teach you! Come with me. Sir, what are you doing? - You can watch, Lekha. Sir, please! How many times have I told you to talk to that girl? Sir, please. She doesn't like it, huh? She won't act? She expects me to beg? Don't ever think you can go somewhere and escape from me. I'll track you down and hit you. And your Raghu! I'll go to his house and destroy his family. What did she say? She said she won't act? - Sir, please let go of her. She ran away for love? - Please let go. She only needs me to pay her fees? - Sir, I'll do anything you say. Please! I'll act! I have to do all this to make you obey? The things he did... I can't even begin to describe. His own wife! I begged him... All because I left with Raghu. All because I shouldn't leave with him again. So I had no other option... It made my head dizzy. I knew there had to be some story. But I did not expect this. Don't cry. My heart was bleeding. The man who tormented her is right outside. Don't let him walk this earth, Raghu. Raghu, don't do this. Raghu, there is no one out there? Come back in. Just come back, please. Come in. Close the door. I wanted to go after him and beat him up. But Lekha... I need to comfort her. Protect her like the apple of my eye. Graze her gentle as a feather. I'm very sorry, Raghu. I should have called you. 'There is no need for words; Just go to sleep in my arms.' 'While I protect you like the apple of my eye; You can dissolve into a dream.' 'My fingers will caress you, Gentle as a feather.' 'As if from memory, Our hearts will speak.' 'Not wanting to shed any tears; I held it back in my eyes.' 'I held back a drop; My eyes welled up like an ocean.' 'Even when we were apart; I thought about you every single day.' 'Even when we were separated; My love was always true.' 'In the dawn that's yet to come; In the dusk that's endless to us.' 'You and I lie in a sweet embrace; Under the blanket there's no time nor space.' 'We take the clock's word on the time; That time is only to get dressed.' 'My heart will never forget; Even when I'm dead.' 'You're my first; And my last.' 'You're my earth; And my skies.' 'Even when you go far away; Even when you're unreachable like the sky;' 'It's only my field of vision that you left; In my heart you stayed.' 'You wrote a sweet letter with your lips; Before I could reply, you dissipated.' 'You can always have your way; My temper will ebb away.' 'We lost our beautiful selves; Now there will be monsoon.' 'There is no need for words; Just go to sleep in my arms.' 'While I protect you like the eyelids; You can dissolve into a dream.' 'My fingers will stroke you, Gentle as a feather.' 'As if from memory, Our hearts will speak.' 'Not wanting to shed any tears; I held it back in my eyes.' 'I held back a drop; My eyes welled up like an ocean.' 'Even when we were apart; I thought about you every single day.' 'Even when we were separated; My love was always true.' 'There is no need for words; Just go to sleep in my arms.' Lekha? Lekha! Lekha, I know you're inside. Open the door. Raghu! Raghu! Come with me. Both of you stay inside. Raghu, they'll just leave after some time, like yesterday. Just for a second, I hesitated. I need to move on with life. Dad. Mom. Saranya. Saranya's wedding. Lock it. These people are just scum. They will leave. But only for one second. They think they can get away with anything. I need to at least confront them. Before I kill them. What do you want? Where is Lekha? - She is inside. Superb! We don't want any trouble here. Leave. Who's causing trouble? He is like a father to that girl. What? - Let me talk. He'll just have a chat with her and leave. I also need to check the house. Okay? Now, we're going up again. You are going to open the door. Come on. At the police station yesterday she said her name was Niveditha. Did she now? What are you staring at? Love, is it? She's been with so many men after you left. You remained single, didn't you? Girls, I tell you. I'm trying to protect her... along with this police man. She misunderstood that and ran away. She could have made it big in Hindi Cinema. She's ruined it for herself. Come. What? Why this tough guy act now? What's your problem, boy? You wimp. You killed my brother, didn't you? I saw that. Now I need to send two dead bodies to your house... including yours. They always expect your hand to strike first, never your leg. Open the door. Now that I'm in it, I don't care even if I die. Come on! Beast mode. Pain. Of course I knew there would be pain. But I didn't know there would be a knife entering me. Don't let it plunge any deeper, Raghu! Let go of my hand. Who did you call a wimp? You called me a wimp? So I survived death there just to come and die here? What did you do to them, Raghu? What happened to them? I don't care. One of them shot my brother to death. I stabbed him with a knife. The other one was like an animal with her. I beat the crap out of him. It'll be nice if both of them die. Let's see! Raghu! What happened to him? Is he okay? No, he is okay. He is just ill. Hold the wound. Hold the wound. Hold it tight! It's not a deep wound, right? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't be silly! You're okay. You're not going to get me into trouble, are you Mythili? Let me see what I can do. Thank you, Amit. Thank you so much. How did you meet Thiru, Lekha? That's the flat. I didn't talk to anyone. I kept to myself. The only reason I agreed to do other films... was to get my freedom from Kuberan. I knew he could turn into an animal at any moment. All I ask of you is just 5 years! You can be happy and free. Hang out with your friends. Just not that stupid boy from Pollachi. Wherever we went, he made it look like I was his property. Like I belonged to him. Like I was his girl. That's the image he created everywhere. I gave him hell whenever I could. Last couple of days, I even slammed the door on his face. I didn't even talk to him. Insulted him as much as possible. One day, he took me to Mumbai for a meeting. I only went because my foster mother begged me. Suddenly, Anand, the Hindi actor, came to my room. Babes, what happened? Lekha, right? Babes! It's really cool. I'll wait for you, you take your time. I didn't know he was there to pimp me out. So you don't like it easy, huh? Playing hard to get? Get off me. - This is called a bear hug! How old are you? That guy has got pictures of you bathing and changing. I just saw all those nude pictures. That guardian of yours... he just showed them to me. I'm going to call the cops. Oh, you want to call the cops? I'll call them! The cops are in the next room. I'll call them? I'm a superstar! Yeah! Just leave me. - Don't fight it. Sit back and enjoy. Who the hell is that? - Help me please. What do you want? I thought you guys left. He is here without your consent, right? I know, but I thought I'll ask anyway. Yes. Then, come. Just sit over here. Sit! Dude, what the hell? Who are you? My name is Thirumal. Thiru. I'm Raghu's brother. You know this guy? You know... in movies I do my own stunts. I'll pulverize you. I don't know why... but whenever I saw him on screen, I've felt like hitting him. You mongrel! Please sit! Get up, hero! Kuberan! Kuberan! - Ask him to come, too. Force yourself on a girl again, will you? Will you? Tell me, will you? You're an actor that people look up to. Is this how you behave? And illegal arms deal on top of that? You should die! No. Don't. Spare him. Get out of here. Go, I'll handle this. - Okay. Anand! Anand... Anand? What happened, Lekha? Did he do something to himself? What happened, Anand? - He is sleeping. Weren't you there? Who are you? Who are you? Tell me! Who are you? What's a gun doing in your hands? Is this the laptop? Where else do you have her photos? Just on this laptop. Where else? - Just here! I'll hunt you down and thrash you. No other copies. You want to hit him? Go ahead. Come on. Hit him. One solid whack. Come on! I'm here. Lekha... Don't... Why did you stop? Stop, Lekha! Lekha! That's enough. He might just die! Thiru saved me from Kuberan in more ways than one. He asked me to come with him. There was a van parked under the hotel basement. It was Thiru's van. A police operation. I'd set up cameras in all rooms booked by Kuberan. That's how I knew you were in the next room. You okay? Yes. You can trust me. You're Raghu's brother... I trust you! That actor said Kuberan took some pictures of me. And you asked him too if those pictures were on that laptop. I'm worried the pictures might exist somewhere else. It's okay, Lekha. It's nothing. That was taken without your knowledge or consent. Don't be ashamed of that. Don't let it scare you. It's going to be okay. It won't be anywhere else. Even if there are photos somewhere else, we'll get rid of it. Okay? He took me to another place. But it wasn't his house. I stayed there. He worked non-stop for almost 24 hours. He was working with the camera footage from the van on a laptop. Three years of hard work... as an undercover police officer. I threw it all away in a second. I left. I got what I wanted, and I exited the hotel. Then I came in again. To the hotel room. Because you're Raghu's girl. Please talk to Raghu at least for that? He knew about us. That's why he came up to save me. I'd have come anyway! The next night, he called me suddenly and asked me to come out. Then we went to a gym. Then, to another location. He said the police and some gangsters were on his trail. Fenn was with us the whole time. He was driving. We drove around in the car all day. That's when I decided that I had to call you. Thiru shifted me to three different places. I did as I was told. I was scared for Thiru's safety. I felt that you should meet him. And I was right. I'm so sorry, Raghu. Yet again, you're my hero. I'm going to miss you now more than ever. You protected my heroine. In style. You kept her safe. You gave her back to me. Thank you, Thiru. Did he give you something? The 'corrupt cop' tag has to go. I need to redeem your name. Everyone needs to know that you are my hero. What I'm about to do next is for you, brother. This one's for you. Use this phone. I'm here, I'll take care of her. The police will be looking for you. even if he is still alive. If he's dead, it will be worse! They must have surrounded my apartment by now. What are we going to do now? Why are you leaving now? For what? There is something I need to do for Thiru. I need to send him off peacefully, too. This was the gym Thiru came to. He told me this was the key to a locker. I don't know what it is that I'm looking for. But a strong feeling that it's here. Everything seemed to go my way, until I opened the lock. What everybody is looking for must be here. And this is the key to that. Just when I thought that I had cracked it... There was nothing. It was a dead end. Something felt wrong. Something is wrong, Raghu. Lekha said Fenn went with them. I need to get hold of him and find out where else Thiru went. The moment I saw him I knew. Police. Here we go again. Raghu. Raghu... I'm DCP Suraj. You were described to me as a young 25 year old.... frail looking fellow with a moustache and a beard. Changed your look, is it? Why? So you're Suraj? One - I'm going to arrest you for attacking a police officer... and grievously injuring him while he was on duty. And two - whatever you found inside that locker... I need you to hand it over to me. I'm not surprised! Now. There was nothing inside, sir. It was empty. Don't move. Turn. Open your mouth. Give me his phone. Madrasi, what do you have? Frisk him. Sir, can I make a phone call? After we reach the station. - Sir, please. They took everything from me. The key that Thiru gave me, my wallet. They took my phone, too. For your brother. 'Ask, and it shall be given.' I was in a state of panic. I had to speak to Lekha one last time. I had to move them elsewhere. I had to tell her not to answer her phone. Hello? Hello? Who is this? - Hey, hero... What is it? - Where is Lekha? Stay on the line. Get in, ladies. - Stop! Where are you taking us? Get in, Lekha. - You're in for trouble. Whose number is this? You should be with the police. Please, pass the phone to Lekha. I need to talk to her, please. This other chick... her name is Mythili? She is pretty hot! I’m getting Lekha to get into this car, threatening I’ll hurt Mythili if she doesn’t. I just slapped Lekha around a bit too. You kept them at a place thinking it's a safe hideout. But I got them, didn't I? Want to know how? A good police man gave me your phone. I texted your girl, 'Love you. Coming by Uber. Send address.' She sent it to me! I got to the house and the hot chick opens the door. You're living the life, man! You don't know me. You thought I'm this guy who makes terrible films, right? Your brother didn't tell you anything about me? You can't even ask him now. Poor fellow is dead. You will meet with the same fate. When you die, there should only be one thing on your mind. This girl, she always looked at me like I was a piece of shit.... with no gratitude for the life I have given her. I'm going to get physical with your girl, Lekha... a few times at least... and I'm only talking about tonight. I'm going to have a lot of fun doing that. I'll straighten her out in the end and keep her with me. Forever. Hold that thought in your head when you die. You can't run. - Sit tight. There is nothing I can do... but wait. We're here. This way. Fenn. He has brought the police here. Why? What was this place? They said they're taking me to the police station. But they were taking me somewhere else. Where the hell have they brought me? The switch is over there. Whose house is this? - Thiru's safe-house. Sit. Sit down. Down there. We need to search for the hard-disk here? - Those were the orders. Why has he been brought here? Maybe he's been here already. No, it's his first time. - Let's begin, then? Let's wait. They're searching another one of DCP Thiru's hideouts. We shall start the search here once we hear from them. Okay. The key came back to me. Why did Thiru give me this key? There was nothing in the gym locker. Did someone get there before me and get the hard-disk? I decided to hold on to the key, just in case. Just let her go. You've got me, right? Stop touching me. If I let her go, she'll go to the cops, call the press and all that. She's in my fold now. It's a one way entry. No exit. I have no idea how it's going to end for you two. Let's see. You know what happens when someone gets in my way. You dare hit me? You just went away with his brother. You slept with his brother, too? You were with both the brothers, huh? Just shut up! Sir, please don't... - I don't want to hit you. Take your hands off her. - Just sit quietly. First the younger brother, then, the older brother. Just my luck. I only wanted to take you to heights of success. Was that wrong? I don't want that. You can't force me any more. You're going to die for this! You hate me because I didn't send you with that Pollachi fellow? Or is it because I got nude photos of you? That was to scare you into staying with me and be obedient. What did he do with it? He must have had fun looking at it! Poor guy... is dead now! I didn't even make any copies of it. I should have! He destroyed it, you scum. No worries, we'll make fresh ones. Let's shoot now? Are you ready? I can't sit around and wait for a miracle. Sit. It's anyway this or nothing. Sit. I have to make this miracle happen. I said, sit. What did you say? And if a lamp had to be lit, let's light it now. Pain is inevitable. But it has to be overcome. I have to master it, and go on. I'm on auto-pilot mode no more. - What's going on, imbeciles? Beast mode no more. - Get out, all of you. This is death-wish mode. Bring it on! I'll do this myself. Anand... Wait in the car. You don't think before hitting a policeman? You've got no fear? Where is the hard-drive? Why don't you put your gun down and talk? You went to the gym because he gave you the key and asked you to. I asked you the other day. If he gave you something. But you didn't tell me anything. I don't have to tell you any bloody thing. You opened the locker... What was in there? A hard-drive? Or why did you go there? I know you barely spent 5 minutes in there. What did you do? How did you do it? He stored everything on his cloud account, didn't he? He had left the password inside the locker? You read it and swallowed the paper down? I know his cloud ID... and you know the password, right? Just tell me the password and leave. I'm not after you. I don't need you. Even though you stabbed me with a knife, I still forgive you. You can go! Was there a password? - There was a password. What is it? What's your name? DCP Nagaraj. Nagaraj is a son-of-a @#$%^ That's the password. C'mon, that's a joke, you have to laugh! But he didn't laugh. He shot me instead. I was done for. What the hell? What? - What's going on? He thrashed our men. So I shot him. I'm just making sure he is dead now. Enough! We needed him alive! You're the reason for this mess. Damn! You had one job. And you couldn't do that! He is just a kid. You can't handle a kid? Get out of here. Go! This is what happens when in the 'state of death'. I feel unbearable pain. I can hear my own voice, and other voices. I can feel something heavy on me. I could feel it. Yes, Lala? The team has reached. The entire team is on it. Nagaraj is dead? Anand Bhai! What are you saying? They killed Nagaraj? Yes, Kuberan. Nagaraj is dead. They didn't find anything as yet. And under his dead body was the body of the cop's brother. Phone no need. I'll come there. Bring her with you. - Okay. Lekha, your guy Raghu is dead. Poor thing. Part 1 ends here. Let's see what happens to you in Part 2. Trust me, Lekha! Why would I lie to you? I just got the call. No, it can't be true. It can't be true. Okay? He can't mess around with the police! If he had stayed put with you, I'd have hit him a few times and sent him back home. He must have gone overboard. That's why they just shot him down. Lekha, calm down. I've never seen you act like this in front of the camera. Lekha, It's okay. No, don't cry. I'm sure he is okay. Listen to me... Don't cry. Please. I am not dead. This is definitely not how it is after death. You must wait a little longer before we can meet again, big brother. Wait for me. In my story, now I'm the hero. It won't work if the hero dies. That palm reader was right. I should recommend him to everyone. Not all bullets kill. This bullet wasn't meant to kill me. When Thiru gave me this key I didn't understand why. But its purpose is clear to me now. I held on to it, just in case. Thank God I did. But there was more. This was some magic key like in Alibaba tales. What is this, Thiru? I've seen it all this past week. The man who killed my brother is lying dead here. You shot me, but you died. Oh the irony! They came in here looking for a hard-drive. Many men came in looking for it. I heard them searching. I must get out of here. And then, unknown to me, came the ray of light. I believe in hope. Dogged spirit. Must get your hands dirty. Divine grace. Supernatural powers. The bond of blood. I believe in these things. I believe in being in the right place... at the right time. What was that? Come on! Stop! I'll kill you. Catch him. Stop. You can't escape anywhere. Don't let him get away. - Not this time, sir. Three top cops. Police officers of the Mumbai police... are killed right outside the Greater Mumbai Crime Branch office just after midnight... on the 24th of August 2015. This can only be described as a gangland shooting. As the officers were walking in to record their findings... on an illegal arms deal and a police-gangster nexus.... that was taking shape. I got away from there and found my spot. I have the hard-drive now. I connected it to the laptop and went through the files. My brother, DCP Thiru's report. It was a comprehensive finding. He had exposed an illegal arms deal. It incriminated many big names. Police officers. It had voice recordings and video footage all taken candid. No wonder everybody was after this! To look at Thiru's face... To hear his voice... ...illegal arms that was found at one of his warehouses on Madh island. Operation Nexus began on Jan 1st 2016. Hello? Nagaraj? Nagaraj? That scum Anand told me you were dead. Where is Lekha? What is this now? Scary tales, is it? You're calling from Nagaraj's phone. Aren't you dead yet? Anand said you had died, too. Like you said, he is scum. Where are you? I'm lying on Lekha's lap. Want to talk to her? Or should I come over? It's so cozy. You would know. You're living in this dream world even when you're not filming. You should have just stayed in your dream world. Turkey... An arms deal worth 5 billion. Just wow! For your taste, your sensibilities and your crappy films... this is way beyond your league. Come on a video call. Tadah! Say 'hi' to our Pollachi hero. Sorry, I got wrong information. Raghu... He is alive. Did you get a good look? That hot chick is here too. You can say 'hi', too. If you don't get here and hand over that stuff to me... I'll hire some men... I've got these two low-lives already with me... I'll draw up a contract with them... it will be about shooting a film in the car with these girls. If these findings comes out, you will be jailed within 24 hours. After that, if you use your influence and get out... I'll hunt you down myself, and bludgeon you to death. But then again... my brother is dead anyway. Why am I worried about redeeming his name? YOU COME TO ME! Bring Lekha and Mythili with you. If you're feeling scared, bring your goons along. I'm here in the middle of a road. It's 2 in the morning. There isn't a living soul around me. The laptop is out of charge. I can't even shoot anything with my phone camera now. I don't have the source to make any sort of backup and I don't need to, either! Between you and me, you're the one who would consider screwing me over. I wouldn't. So, hand over Lekha and Mythili to me... take the laptop and hard-disk, and run for your life. Where should I come? Raghu... This is not the time to play hero, Raghu. You do know that they are looking for you everywhere? I hope you're okay. You are okay? I'll survive, sir. Tell me, what can I do for you? I need only one thing from you. The most important thing. My brother... His body. I need to have my brother's body. I'll do it for you. - I beg you. Yes, I'll do it for you. But... can you come where I tell you to, for the body? Yes, sir. I've come to the location pin you sent me. What now? Tell me. You spoke so much without a pause. Hello? Are you on the line? Hello? You're going overboard. Hello? Hello? Which vehicle? Black Ford Endeavour. What do you want me to do? Get off the vehicle. Me? Yes, you. Come out! Come out alone and walk towards me. You wanted Lekha, right? I'll send her over, tell me where you are. She'll come running to you, like Manisha Koirala! Have you seen the film Bombay? If you don't come out now, I'll just leave. I'm not coming out. I'll send Lekha. I'm sending her to you. But I'll keep the other chick with me. You just think about how you're going to hand over the hard-drive to me. If you don't get here now... I'm leaving from here... and I'll make sure this video is trending all over the world by morning! Fine, kid! I'm coming out. But if something happens to me, the car will leave with these girls. You'll never see them again. If I don't return in ten minutes, take the girls away. Okay, boys? Where? Just keep walking. The same direction your car came from. I'm coming. Keep going. Keep going. Stay on the walkway. I must stay alive. Then, to live a peaceful life... I must give him the hard-drive. What will you do, Raghu? If only they hadn’t thought I was a wuss! If only Kuberan hadn't pulled out his gun. If only DCP Suraj had been a good cop. This story would have had a very different end. Dear... Raghu! And Lekha is with him. Mom! Dad! How are you? I'm good. You're on time! Welcome back. Lekha... How are you? Bless you. Are you well? - I'm sorry. That's okay, dear. That's my friend, Mythili. Welcome. - I remember her. Thiru hasn't come? No, he didn't. He is doing well. He is in Bombay. He kept asking about you. He is a police officer now. A police officer? I barely managed to spend a few minutes with him. There was a big case... Thiru tapes. Operation Nexus. Because of Thiru. Because of me. Within 24 hours, almost everyone incriminated in the video were arrested. Including Superstar Anand. Some of them were already done for. What Mr. Bhide joked about was true after-all. "Two brothers came to Mumbai and shook up the city." We did shake up the establishment. You got to meet Thiru. It's a good thing you went there. Raghu, don't tell them where I am. Just that I will come. I made sure my father didn't have to do the one thing he shouldn't have to, ever. I ended up doing it for him. The moment I saw my parents, I decided that they needn't know about it. Forgive me. I know... this is not over. They will come after me. Just one difference. This time around, it will be... Bullets with their names on it.
