5-year old twin boys, one a pessimist and the other an optimist, The psychiatrist took the pessimist to a room piled high with new toys, expecting the boy to be thrilled, but instead he burst into tears! "Don't you wanna play with these toys?" "Yes, but if I did, I'd only break them." Next, the psychiatrist took the optimist to a room piled high with horseshit. The boy yelped with delight, joyfully tossing the manure into the air with glee. "What on earth are you doing?" "Well" said the boy beaming, "There's gotta be a pony in here somewhere."

A little bit of fun for you might mean a lot of trouble for everyone else. So stay clear, OK? The hardest thing for me in the summer is to keep the girls away. Okay, so this is your turf. 10.30. Don't be late! Managers never wait for firstyears. Okay? Go to that house first! This house first? I wonder if they have any money.

Excuse me, how much are they? - 600 dollars. That's kind of a lot. - You could buy one for 20 bucks. Can I see? - Yeah, sure. Take a look. I shouldn't? - Pick some exciting bits! I think my son might like these. Can I see some more? - Yeah, sure. Check them all. You know what I'll take these, and maybe a few more. How much would that be? - Compare it to something expensive. It's 200 dollars. - That's kind of expensive. What people like about the way I do business is... You can pay now or at the end of the summer. End of the summer, that would be good! No, he's just joking. We can make a payment plan, you pay some now, some in two weeks and the remaining balance at the end of the summer I mean, you could pay 20 bucks for one... I have an appointment here. They're ready to buy, just need to show the dad. It's going to be a pony! A pony? You don't know what a pony is? You are such a rookie! Jesus! No! You stay in the car.

Didn't know you were waiting. No, it's ok. It's good that we don't have two women in the HQ. Otherwise we would've waited for an hour. What happened to Kristina? - Norris sent her away. You know, off schedule and too lazy. Dusty, what's up! - Good morning! Ha, it's just weeks, don't get over excited, hombre! You better bring your A-game! Has your team quit?! - In your dreams baby!

Why did she quit? - Said it's not for her. That she didn't like selling. Hey Norris, why isn't Kristina here anymore? You know, it didn't work out! Ok guys, imagine. A cool ocean breeze blowing on your face, you have a glass in your hand and the view is like paradise. White sand, turquoise water, blue sky, not a cloud in sight. And the glass in your hand a Margarita! You can feel the cold condensation dripping on your suntanned skin. You take a sip. How does it taste? Tastes like happiness! Tastes like coffee to me. You don't look like you want the sun, the beach and the Margaritas. Anna has been outselling you! You need to pick up the pace! See more people! Number one, baby! Minivan and Ford Escort! Minivan and Ford Escort, Ferrari, Ferrari! Britney Spears, Britney Spears! Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears! Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears Limp Bizkit, Limp Bizkit! Let's go! Hey, Norris? I don't know how to put this... I don't think this is for me. Four zero days in a row! - Character building days! The first three weeks is all about horse shit and no ponies! You make all your money in the last three weeks. Everybody buys. What if they don't? - Don't worry, you got this! Alan! Chop chop! You take Anna to her turf today, Martin, you follow me, ok? Enough of showing the books. Time for you to start selling them! Everybody has their best day right after they follow the White Tiger! So, how do you do? I mean, how are you today? I'm fine, thanks. Nice day. - Yeah. I like your playlist. - Really? Thanks! You know, I do a little bit of DJing. Oh really? That's cool! My first boyfriend was a DJ. Where do you usually play? You know, private parties, and clubs and post stuff on Youtube and Soundcloud, you know, the usual thing. So, your first boyfriend... Who would be dumb enough to break up with you? My first boyfriend. Yeah, I know, but why? Just got boring. Oh yeah, I know about that. It usually gets boring for me too. Then I just, you know, move on. What? No, he just went to study abroad. and we didn't see each other. That's why it got boring. Not that I... OK. Well, yeah, that's what I meant. Just school and it's like far away and yeah... C'mon! Everybody buys! I'm coming in! Everybody buys. Hello. Didn't I already tell you I wasn't interested? You're Jenny right? And this must be Ren! Hi, pal! How do you know my name? - I'm Norris, pleased to meet you finally! Didn't Marcia, Dana or Ms Peterson mention I would drop by? Dana, my colleague from the hospital? That's why you haven't heard about me. I didn't mean to sneak up on you, sorry. It's strange that they didn't talk about me. Tell you what, I only got like 7 minutes. Let's do this real fast. I'll show you what they got. You want to sit outside maybe or probably you have a kitchen table or something. If you'd like to, yeah. - Wow, that's an amazing house. Saw the way I dropped that pen? You think that was an accident? It wasn't? - No way, Dorothy! That's a trick! Bookfield technique. You drop the pen, you win the trust. You're vulnerable, clumsy, harmless to a customer. She buys! Everybody buys! And don't forget the big fat American smile. C'mon, give it a try! Open it up. All the way! C'mon, show me your teeth. More, more, more! More, yeah! That's the way to do it! It's America! It's double XL country. Everything is big! So, I'll be right back. Just one second. I got you a chocolate. I can't. I'm on a diet. - Oh, well I got those for you. Thanks, you shouldn't have. It's OK. So, here's your turf. And 10.30 I will pick you up. And if you're late, don't worry. I will wait for you. That's what managers are for! Chop-chop, Martin! Everybody buys! - You work pretty intensively. How can you keep up with this for 13 hours? No big deal. I once stayed up for 3 days in a row to win leave of absence from the army to go to party. This is like vacation to me. I wish we were in Alaska, then we could sell from 5 AM till midnight! You should try polyphasic sleep. What? - Polyphasic sleep! You can be like totally productive and only sleep like 2.5 hours a day. Hey! - You must be Tom. Well, sir, this is your very special day! What are you doing with a knife? Don't you know it's dangerous? You can hurt yourself with that! Chop-chop, Martin! C'mon, Martin! I lost my wallet! - Is that it? Yeah that's mine! - Get yourself a bumbag. Last year a firstyear left his wallet in a trailer. Never saw it again! Make sure your money is always with you! You sleep 2.5 hours? - What? Oh yeah, polyphasic sleep. You need to sleep 20 minutes every 3 hours. But you can't break schedule. if you break schedule you'll be totally wasted for like 2-3 weeks! Sounds like some voodoo. Hi, my name is Alan. My friends call me Predator. I'm here to talk to all the parents of the kids around here, so... Hey, there! - Oh hi! I didn't see you there. My name is Alan and I'm from Europe. Over here for a summer job. You are? - Yeah! You're very pretty, are you from Sweden? It's a tiny country called Estonia. But it's basically Sweden, yeah. Yeah, and what can I do you for? Well I'm supposed to meet with all the moms and the teachers around here. I'm not a teacher, I'm a photographer. A photographer? Cool! I'm a DJ. - Very nice. I have some records in the house. Would you like to come in and take a look? Sure. As long as it doesn't take too long. Very nice, sugar. Are you over 18? - Yeah. Great, honey, come on in! Wow, man, nice house! Nice pictures, man! Are those yours? Wow, look at this one! But why are they all naked? Wait, that's my shirt, man! No, wait, man, you cannot take my shirt! Where's the bathroom? Is it that way? How does it feel? Have you settled in already? I have settled in, yeah. So, I just got a new guitar and I'm good to go. Great! And what is it that you do daily? Are you a musician? No, I'm in IT. Most of the time it's a pretty fun job. So you have the power to make people happy by fixing everything magically. Fix their computer, so they can do their work. I don't know if that makes them happy or not. Dad, there's a Pikachu on my bed, come look! But that's what I do. What do you do here? I'm selling comic books. Thank you so much for getting the books. I'm sure Max will love them! - You're very welcome. I actually have a few friends I can recommend as well. - That's great! Maybe you can just write down their names? You have a driver's license? - No, I don't. But you can drive, right? Then it's fine It's time for you to get some wheels, so you can work in the countryside! See that guy trying to sell his car over there? Get your mind right, this baby is yours! OK, let's go! Hey sir! You look like a really cool guy and I was just wondering since the car is just standing here, it must be a real hassle to sell it. We could do you a favor take the thing off your hands! - For nothing? Yeah, just give it to us. - No way, this used to be my grandfather's car, he used to drive it every day. I wouldn't take less than 700 bucks. It's a perfectly good car, it runs great! 700? No way! It must be here for ages! The way it's eroding. Tell you what, we'll help you out. Let's do 150, cash. 600. - 200. 500. - Sir, 200 is really all we can pay. Can't do it. Ok, you have a beautiful day, mister. Thank you. Come, Martin. Dude, 500 is totally OK. Don't look back, the first one to break loses. In exactly two seconds. One, two... Hey, wait a minute! Yeah, what was that? Here you go, Martin! Thank you, sir! Yeah, good luck! Good luck! These are cool, aren't they? These are really cool! I like these. Kyle, would you use these? Totally! - Awesome, dude! He would totally use these. These are really good for him. Yeah, and the price isn't that bad either. What's the price? It's 600 dollars. I can't afford that, babe. I'm sorry, we can't afford that. We have bills, there's rent, it's been a rough year. I'm a single mom, I just can't afford it. We could do a payment plan. I mean you could pay half now and half at the end of the summer. Please! - I can't, I'm sorry, honey. You shouldn't have came here. The rich ones don't want the books. The ones who want them, have no money. Ponies don't exist. It's a myth, bullshit by Jack Rose, to make beginners quit. But why do I have the feeling that I don't want to quit? Day 36. The solution to any problem is behind the next door. Hey, this is Dusty! I'm either working or sleeping, leave your name and number and I'll call you back on Sunday! Dusty, what's up bro! Hey, listen man! Guess who just hit the jackpot! Amazing day, man! I just met a customer, sold her the whole package, man! Everything! She just bought everything! Everything! 3 am! In a gas station! Do you have a place we can sit down? What everybody likes about the way I do business is that I take orders today and deliver at the end of the summer. Do you have a place we can sit down? Oh hey! How you doing? You good? - Yeah. Sorry. Shit! Hon, I'm sorry, your card was declined! Oh, no problem, I've got cash. Do you take payment plans? Excuse me? - You know, payment plans. I will pay you two dollars now, two dollars in two weeks and the remaining budget at the end of the summer? No idea how to do that! Here you go! - Thank you, hun! Yeah, my check must have bounced. You know customers checks bounce sometimes. It's a typical thing. It's a great day to be a bookman, it's a great day, I know. It's a great day to be a bookman everywhere I go. It's a great day to be a bookman... It's a great day, I know! - Great day! Hey, good morning! It's a great day to be a bookman! It's a great day to be a bookman, everywhere I go. Norris... - Martin, my main man! You look like shit! I have a fever. - How big is it? 38.8 Celsius. Ok, when it gets over 41.5, then go home! Then I'll be in the hospital. Solution to every problem is behind next door. I once worked with a swine flew the whole week. And still had a great week! Ok? Ok! Anna! I told you first day at breakfast it will be hard. Then you maybe didn't believe me. See, it is hard. Yeah, well it's it's not really hard. It's just, time to move on. But that wasn't part of your plan. You came here to finish this! I know. But you guys, keep on going! You'll have a great summer. - Anna, do not be a quitter! The way you do something is the way you do anything. Just go out there and give it 100 percent! Just one day! You can do this! I believe in you! Remember, the pain of discipline is always smaller than the pain of regret. You can do this Anna, ok? OK? OK! So, these are just 600 dollars. Not a bad price, huh? That's a wonderful price! I buy books from you guys every year! Oh, good. So the way everybody likes I do business... Aren't you hot? Gosh, it's hot in here. I'm running a fever actually. - A fever? Let me wipe your head. The way I do business... It's so hot! The way everybody... I mean what... What everybody likes about the way I do business... I take orders now and I deliver at the end of the summer. - I see- Yes, so, I'll buy your books. My husband Tim is from Europe and he took the checkbook today. He would love to come and see you later. He'll be home at 6. Why don't you come at 5.30? Sure, we can do that. Should I go down on... put you down for these? Yes, 5.30, you'll be here? Yes, I'll be here definitely! - I'll buy plenty of books It's time for a nap. 20 minutes, Norris, signing out! Hey! Goddamn skater jerk! Hello. - Hi! Deputy Kepler from Sheriff's office here. We stopped you cause you have no license plate. Do you have your driver's license on you? I... yeah. - You have it? You act a little nervous, everything ok today? I'm running a fever. - Been sick for a little bit or what? Yeah, this is an Estonian license. Ok, you're from Estonia? Is your last name Vabariik? What? - Your last name, is it Vabariik? No, that's my first name. That's your first name. So this is your last name, OK. Hang tight here for a minute. I'll be right back with you. Ok, here's your driver's license back. Here's the thing. In America you have to have your seatbelt on. I do have to issue a citation for the seatbelt. I just need you to sign right here. This is not an admission of guilt, just saying you're going to take care of the citation. OK, thank you. You look a little familiar. Have you heard of anyone around here, a Predator? Anyone? - A Predator? Have you heard of anything like that? No. - Nothing at all? Haven't seen anyone seem suspicious, out of the ordinary? - No. Nothing at all? OK, well here you go. Drive safe! - Thank you! What's that! Who's up next? Who wants some books? Yeehaw! Get it done! Number one! Woohah! Hi! Can you help me please. My car broke down. Don't you read the signs out front here? No trespassing sign, can't you read? It's an emergency. - I don't care about emergencies. You are not supposed to be on this property. Get off the property now. I don't want you here. Now, you need to leave the property now. I mean it, dammit! Can I get one phone call? - No phone calls! Out! Get out of here before I blow you out of here. I will shoot your ass! Are you serious? - I'm serious! What the hell is wrong with you? Read the sign! You can't read English? You're about to make me very angry! You know better to come up here like that. Leave now! I'm not playing. Go! Get the hell out! Don't come back! I thought the worst part of the job would be rejection. But you get used to rejection after hearing "piss off" for 2000 times. The worst is not talking to anyone. You're all alone. In this goddamn desert. On the other side of the world. Sheriff's department has received numerous calls from concerned citizens about a potential Russian child snatching ring operating under the disguise of door to door comic book salesmen. I'd like to do anything but this. Mow the lawn, oversleep, take away fallen leaves. Just not to knock on the next door. I don't give a damn about the sales. Just give me water, I'll sit in an air conditioned room. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing I meet my pony at 5.30. Hi! Are you Tim? - Yes. Is Linda home? - No. She's not home? - No. Did she tell you I'll be here? - No. Are you Tim? - Yeah. My name is Martin, I'm the book guy. I was here in the morning. - So? And Linda told me I can come by and you might be interested. You selling something? - Yeah, I'm selling comic books. Oh, we're not interested. - Wait, did you guys talk about it. Talked about it, we're not interested. How do you know if you haven't seen them? Whatever it is... - I can show you. We're not interested, really. Alright? You're from Europe, right? I'm from Europe. We're both from Europe. - Yeah, good, great. But we're still not interested, ok? What do you... - You can go. Go, go Wooh, amazing day! Yippee ki-yay! Yippee ki-yay Sleep is for pussies anyway! I chased the skater kid and it's impossible to catch him. He was like some crazy, sponsored professional skater or something. I'm like... why me? Why today? Why did he have to steal my money? I worked so hard to get that money, four weeks selling those stupid comic books. Why didn't he just go and steal his parents' money, like I did when I was a kid. I though Americans were nice, that they're exceptional, they have higher consciousness. I mean it's crazy like just... It takes just one runt on a skateboard. Will you ever stop about the money? It's just... Jesus... money. So, when somebody steals half of your money you're all chip chip cheerio? - I wouldn't be chip chip dedidido. Cheerio! - Cheerio, whatever! It's just I wouldn't care about the money. It's not what makes me happy. What makes you happy? Weed. You want some? - Where did you even get that? From a loyal customer of mine. - A loyal customer? Single dad Joe. - Single dad Joe? OK, so, let's say for a moment that I believe you. You don't care about money. Why would you come to America to sell comic books door to door, if you don't care about money? I wanted to have an adventure or a lifetime. So are you having your adventure of a lifetime? No! Not yet at least! Can you feel it in your stomach? I swear, these roads are still better than in Estonia! - I can! Hi, I need a room with two beds please. Is she your girlfriend or sister? We work together. Why? She's so cool! I do you a favor. I tell, I do not have no two beds. I have only one bed. No king bed! Too big. I give you only one regular bed. OK? - I don't think that's necessary. Trust me, my friend! In the morning, you say: "Branimir, thank you!" They only had a room with one bed. Cold shower, baby! I'm going back. Back where? - To sell. Why? I told Norris I'd finish this. I have to keep my promise. You can come too, I mean... Come on, it's just going to be a few weeks. You wouldn't even know before it's over. It's not like I'm going to stay there for another year or anything. I'd never do that. I think I'm just going to go to Vegas. Are you sure about this? - It'll be fun. It's not about the money, you know. Day 90. The more pony shit you see, the bigger are the ponies. Where the hell is my car! Yippie-kaye! Hey, you need to look at these books! Anybody interested in some books? Comic books! Anybody? Books! The last day of the summer is over. After returning to the sales job I worked harder than ever before. Norris overdid polyphasic sleeping and went nuts. I took his Mustang and drove out of town, to look for ponies in the wealthy ranch area. I managed to sell some books, but didn't find a real pony. But I'm not giving up, I press on. The ponies have to be somewhere! It's now or never. Ponies... It's not worth it. No point to risk your life for something that doesn't exist. What the hell happened here? "Sorry guys, you can't stay here anymore." "Don't knock I'm not home." Ok, let's pack this up. These are yours, right? Anna, what are you doing here? - Hi. I'm back! I just... Vegas without you... It was worth nothing. I missed you. We cannot just take back quitters. Once a quitter, always a quitter! Stop. Of course we can take you back! Come here! Well, it's all over anyway! This is your towel. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with me? - You didn't come here to quit! I know you, you're better than this! Just stop being such pussies! C'mon Alan! We can always do one more door! I'm sure you have a John Rose quote somewhere about finishing strong. - It's Jack Rose! And Martin, you know I like you, whatever you do. But the question is do you like yourself when you quit now? The way you do something is the way you do anything! And Norris... Norris is Norris. Mom! - What's wrong with Norris? I found him. - You found him? Yeah, next to the road. He was just sleeping. I don't know. - Number one, baby. Yeah, he's still the number one. She's right! It's hard for me to admit, but she's right! Let's just do one more door! One more. What do you say? You with me, Alan? You with me? Everybody buys! So why are we going to this Emily's house again? Single Dad Joe told me that she runs a daycare and there are like a thousand kids! A thousand kids? - It's gonna be a pony! It's ridiculous, there can't be a thousand. Ok, let's do this! Everybody pays! I mean, everybody buys! Since I'm the senior manager after Norris, I think I should take this. - That's ok, I got this! Anna, you come with me. Alan, stay here. I don't want you to ruin the sale! Ruin the sale... Damn rookies, always take the ponies. What's happening? - She's gonna slam the door, that's what's happening! - Who? They got in! - Yeah! They got in! Yeah! Well done. Wow, you must be really good at your job. Oh thank you! I have four locations. Just so you know, I'm not gonna buy any books today. That's fine, I'll just show them to you real quick. Hi! - Hi, I thought it was Tyler. Where is he? I don't know. He's supposed to be home by dinner. So Emily, there's only one favor I'd like to ask you. Could you just take a good look at what I have to show you and either give me a big "yes" or just give me a big fat "no", cause I really can't stand maybes. It's gonna be a no, but I won't give you a maybe. I can totally take a no, I got my emotions surgically removed in Estonia. Yeah, don't worry, he's not gonna cry. And if he does, then I'm gonna wipe the tears. Aren't you guys funny! See how it breaks it down, step by step right here. Pretty cool, huh? - Yeah, that's pretty neat. Yeah and the kids can totally use it on their own too. They don't need any help from their parents. - Cool! So can you see now why all the daycare owners are lining up for these? - Yeah! So we have 30 big comic books in a set. They cover everything the kids need for learning. And the price isn't bad either. It's not 2000 dollars and it's not even 1000. Can you guess how much it is? It's 600 dollars. That's not bad! Right? In Walmart I saw a bunch of comics for nine dollars. Actually you know what, it's not bad! Do you take credit cards? - Yeah, of course. So should I write you down for four sets? One for each location? No, one set is enough. - What are you doing? This one's gonna be a pony. Just trust me one this. Actually, most daycares buy 10 sets for 6000 dollars. And every one of them buys at least one set for each location. So which one suits best for you? One for each location or do you want to go with a 10 set deal? Can't I just take one set and try it out? I'm sorry, we really can't do that. I mean, it's like a system for daycare. You know what, I don't have two grand in my budget. So, it's going to be a "no". I'm going to have to pass this time. Sorry. - Well, they come around every year. That's totally fine. Like I said, if you like them, great, you buy them. But if you don't, you don't have to buy them, we will still be friends. I'm not going to take it personally you know. Money doesn't grow on trees. - Nope! But I talked to Ms Masterson the other day, she's a teacher, and she said something that really struck me. She said, you know, Martin, ever since I graduated college and started little tots daycares, I've been on a mission. I want these kids to feel safe and be happy at the daycare centre. But most of all I want them to learn. And kids grow up so fast. You have one chance with them. And it's really difficult to find the right tools that are both fun and educational. And she said you know, if we make a difference in kids lives, no investment is big enough! Ok ok,ok! How much were the four sets? Thank you so much for coming. You guys have a good night! Thank you so much! I know you're going to love the books! And the kids will too of course! Have a good night! Tyler, finally! Dinner's on the table! - Mom, he's lying! What? - I didn't do anything, mom. Don't believe him, he's a liar! - What is going on here? Hey, is that the skater kid who stole your wallet? Stole a wallet? What's going on here? I didn't do anything. He's lying! - Did these guys steal Tyler's wallet? No, that son of a bitch stole Martin's wallet. - I knew it! On the radio they talked about Russian child traffickers. I thought these guys were from Estonia... This is just some big misunderstanding. I have no complaints against your son. It was another skateboarder. That's fine, but this is just too much. Give me my credit card slip back. We can work something out. - Give me my credit card slip back. I Googled! There's this thing called "esponian mafia". Now! - We can works something out. No! Give it back, now! Good night. Tyler, inside Now! These are really cool, aren't they? - Yeah. Yeah, would you use these? - Totally. Awesome, buddy. - He would really use these. I can't afford that, babe. I can't. You shouldn't have come here. If we make a difference in kids lives... You really have one chance with them. Hey! I can't accept this! Mama, look! The same cool comic books that guy showed us. The same comics. Look at that! That is awesome! Ponies are everywhere... Maybe I searched in the wrong place. Act now! Everybody buys! Dusty, what's up? Ain't gonna be no next year man! It's time to move on! I want to wear a suit for a change! Suit, you here me! I think you gonna be just fine man. So, what do you think? New Zealand next summer? It would be a great adventure! There are things wrong with your plan. First of all, Latvia is so beautiful during the summer time. Second of all, how can we go travelling when you're selling books? What? No! What, do you think I want to come back here? What you talking about here? - No way, Jose! Do I look like I want to be a book seller for the rest of my life? I got bigger and better plans. - Yeah, I'm sure you do. Day 1. You sexy little thing, don't you ever die! Three... Everybody buys! Wake up! C'mon, wake up! Goddamn rookies! Every year!
