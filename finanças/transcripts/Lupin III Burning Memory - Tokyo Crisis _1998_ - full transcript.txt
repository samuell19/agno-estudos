Monday, July 27 We've been expecting you, Inspector Zenigata. Thanks. Are we all set? Yes, we can take off anytime. - Oh, I can take that. - No, that's alright. Ow! Seems real enough. We are currently 12,000 meters above the Strait of Magellan and traveling at 950 kph. The weather at Narita Airport is sunny and 31Â° Celsius. The world's first underwater roller coaster{\0c& and 78 other attractions are waiting for you...{\0c& Here goes! What the? Heya, Pops! I guess it's a little cold for fireworks, huh? Lupin! Sorry, Pops! I'll be takin' this now! Get back here, Lupin! Achoo! You'll catch cold if you don't change your clothes! Later! W-w-what? Now THAT'S how fireworks should look! You're under arrest, Lupin! My plan worked this time! How do you like that? Get back here! Hi, folks! Luggage coming through. Woohoo! Bye, now! I got you, Lupin! You and I are connected by threads of fate! Imbeciles! Get off me! Curses! Where did he go? Darn it! Pops better pay up if I catch a cold! Lupin the 3rd: Memories of Flames ~Tokyo Crisis~ I'm here to deliver the Tatsumi-no-Yoshinobu. Inspector Zenigata. Thank you. Tuesday, July 28 The Tatsumi and Inui? Two glass plate photos of Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Their names come from the Chinese zodiac. - Glass plates, huh? - Well, they ARE old photos. So if we get 'em both, we'll find the Tokugawa family fortune? Bingo! You win! And it'd be worth trillions today! At the end of the Edo Period, the old bakufu hid its great fortune out of fear that the new government would confiscate it. They inscribed its location in the two photos of Tokugawa Yoshinobu. Those glass plates were named the Tatsumi and Inui and went missing for a long while! Even YOU'RE a Yoshinobu maniac? Someone recently bought them back from foreign collectors. Oh, yeah? Who? Michael Suzuki! Tokyo is growing by the day. But I feel we've lost touch with our heritage. I hope to bring Tokyo's history back when Aquapolis opens. You could call this Edo-Tokyo exhibition one step toward that. You're doing some excellent work here! This is an honor! Thank you for coming! You did well to assemble all these artifacts. It's a blessing of your co-operation! He's chairman of the Council of Asian Art Experts. Thank you for this honor. If there's anything I can do, just let me know. This much? I thank you, Mister Suzuki! - What's wrong? - No, it's nothing! - Well, I'll be going now, Mister Suzuki! - I leave finding the Inui in your hands. Huh? This Yasumoto Kamehachi doll! Maria! You sure like to stand people up, Zenigata-san. We were supposed to meet at 11:00! - Do you know what time it is now? - That's another old-time watch... Three hours! Three hours! You sure that watch isn't broken? Don't go that way! You'll get hurt! I have business this way. My hunches are usually right. I'd listen if I were you... You're so stubborn. You won't even answer the cell phone I gave you! I hate cell phones! Ouch! - See? I told you. - That's unauthorized photography! I have a permit if you'd like to see! Here it is! - Darn it! - Are you running off again? Wait up! And it was the perfect chance to meet Michael Suzuki-san, too... - Why, what would you do? - Maybe I'd get to marry into his family! I'll tell you now, but you'll only meet Lupin if you follow me. - Lupin? - Yep. Lupin the 3rd. This is the best thing about summer! Huh? If you don't want yours, I'll eat it. Say, what's Goemon up to? I have no idea what he or Fujiko-chan are up to; I can't get in contact with them. You're the only one I can count on in a pinch! Sorry, but I can't help, either. It's this cavity... Identity confirmed. Your body temperature indicates a pleasant mood. Thanks. What's the status of your study? Well, um, we're still... Wasn't that how you answered in your last report, too? We're tracking it down as best we can, of course... I'm not fond of worthless investments... I promise we will find it. I hope you do. Police Headquarters{\0c& Hi, there! Commissioner? I heard the news! You protected the Tatsumi-no-Yoshinobu from Lupin the 3rd! It was just a fluke! You're such a modest fellow! Ouch! Anyway, once the search for the Inui ends, I'll make you a guard at Aquapolis! VIPs from around the world will be visiting for the grand opening! As its security, our police department will be seen by the entire world! The entire world, Zenigata-kun! I'm counting on you! That smarts... - What's the greatest joy in your life? - Arresting Lupin. - How about your motto? - Arresting Lupin. Why haven't you ever been able to arrest Lupin? Could you please stop talking? Then answer seriously! I'm trying to work, too! Hey, you, Zenigata. That's you, isn't it, Lupin? Hiya, Pops! Fancy meetin' you here! This is him? Don't assume you can waltz in here and then just leave! Don't! Here I come! Hiiiya! Bye, bye, Pops! I TOLD him not to... That's some intuition! You're going to waste as his partner! Ouch! Hey! Don't be taking pictures of this! Ow... Maria, huh? Say, why don't you team up with me? - With a thief? - Every day is an exciting roller coaster ride! It's tempting... Your roller coaster leads right into jail! Wait! Stop! - Imbecile! Get out of the way! - Don't blame me! Bye! - Get back here! - Hey! Undo these handcuffs! What am I supposed to do? Wait! Ouch! - Will be departing shortly. Lupin! - Don't get on! - Wait! Please refrain from rushing inside. Please refrain from rushing inside. Step aside, please. - There's no escape, Lupin! - Sorry! Pardon us! Whoa! Pervert! - Get out, pervert! - Sicko! It's summer and you're dressed like that. You can't blame them for getting the wrong idea... This is my trademark! Wait! Stop the train! Lupin? Get off! The train's full... Curse you, Lupin! I'll get you next time! Don't you forget that! What's wrong, Maria-chan? Chief! It's not like you to be glum... I can't do it. I can't follow Inspector Zenigata around. I know! Let me help with the Michael Suzuki story! Don't be silly. The Zenigata article will be a part of the Aquapolis special. - He'll be one of the experts there. - Chief! - Maria-chan! Your photos are done. - Thank you! Is he REALLY an expert? Sakagami Dental Clinic Come to me, Lupin... Hah, what a lame little trick! Here we go! It's not Car #1! It's not Car #2... Not Car #3... Not Car #4... Which means our winner is Car #5! Pops? What is this? Crap! One, two, three, four... There's an extra one! This is Zenigata! Lupin is behind Car #5! Execute Formation C! Drat! Where'd you hide it? Ahh! I'm surrounded! Now you can't move, Lupin! Car #6! Now! Roger! Damn, so THAT'S the deal... That's sneaky! What the? Pops! You're mine, Lupin! Lupin? I guess we do battle tonight, Pops! Damn! - Maria! What are you doing here? - I can't let you have all the fun! Hold on tight! You moron! Are you trying to fling me off? Hey! I can't see! You can at least say thanks! - Can we chase him in this? - Do I have police permission? - Naturally! - OK! Leave it to me! I've always wanted to try this! He's as strong-minded as ever! Let's see how they like improvisation! What the? - That was close! - I gave no orders to drive recklessly! Time out! Not good! Things've gotten out of hand! Come on! Come on! Oh, crap! Farewell! Open wider! Now let's apply the anesthetic! Say ah... How odd... - Lupin! - Oh! Jigen! Give me back my patient! - Sorry to burst in during your treatment! - Don't worry about it. Accidents between Daishi and Haneda Yes. Send ambulances and fire trucks immediately. - I thought you hated cell phones? - I loathe them. - Lupin! - He's so persistent! Jigen. You got the wheel. - Good evening! - Are you Lupin? Thanks for the welcome party earlier! I'll be taking the Inui-no-Yoshinobu now, Mr. Bodyguard! Think you can? - Can't you do something? - Don't be crazy! Goemon! Now! Ahh! My tooth! That's it! Well done! I can't see! Goemon! Yikes! Not good! We're outta here! Hurry! Don't let Lupin get away! You! In the red car! Pull over at once! Inspector Zenigata! You're under arrest for flagrant traffic violations! Come again? Not good... Wednesday, July 29 77 were hospitalized and 400 hurt in the two accidents late last night. The Metro Police Department is scouring the city for Lupin the 3rd and his accomplices, who caused this mayhem. They're treating us like criminals! Talk about pathetic. The great Lupin the 3rd failing twice in a row... Talk about pathetic. A gunman who can't shoot 'cuz his tooth hurts... Stop, Jigen! That's a... - cigarette-shaped mini oxygen tank. Definitely pathetic... There's nobody home. Who is it? Oh! It's from Fujiko-chan! What's she have to say? "I'll be waiting at 'G-H nine' in Ueno at 8:00 tonight. The two of you can come." Why you? You idiot! How dare you tarnish my name? The only GOOD thing is that nobody died! Yes, sir! I take full responsibility! Therefore, I will capture Lupin the 3rd at once and... You will do no such thing! "Notice of Suspension..." Commissioner! What's the meaning of this? You're forbidden to work for the time being! That's crazy! Nobody besides me can arrest Lupin! You should be grateful YOU weren't arrested! Stomach Medicine{\fs0 - But! - Take some time off! That's an order! Very well, sir. Gondoh. You really messed up. I'm sorry, sir. It's all right. As long as the Tatsumi-no-Yoshinobu is in my hands, the enemy will come to me. I'll be the one who writes the battle scene. 3 Days until Aquapolis Opens! Let's hit another bar! You're payin'! Suspension? Who else can possibly catch Lupin besides me? You should stop! You're poisoning yourself! Yuck. - Fill 'er up! - You got it! Drink too much cheap sake and you'll turn dumb! Leave me alone! - Must be tough with your boss like this. - No, he's not my boss... - Your old man, then? - Yeah, right! Your boy toy, then? Keep it up and I'll get really mad. You're not the type to get mad so easily. Nicely said! Who're you to talk? You're drinking out of desperation! I'm not mad yet. Remember how those trailers did their own thing on the freeway? Come to think of it, they almost ran into my car, too... All the drivers were picked by Michael Suzuki. - Does that mean... - Seems fishy to me. It'll all make sense once I catch Lupin. Zenigata-san! Zenigata-san! It's good to see you two again! So? What's this about? - Will you team up with me? - Team up? To sneak into Aqua Tower and steal the Tatsumi-no-Yoshinobu. Interesting. We gonna split the Tokugawa fortune equally? - More like 80-20. - 80 for me, 20 for you? - The other way around. - Yeah, right! I'll pass! Well, if that's how you want it. Let's go, Goemon. What? Hey! Goemon! What's going on? Explain yourself! You can't honestly leave until the show is over, can you? I suppose you're right. Alright, time to explain. - I'm sorry! - Don't give me sorry. Why are you workin' with Fujiko? I have my reasons! Don't tell me she used her powers of seduction on you... No! That would NEVER happen! Hey, now. Calm down, Goemon. Goemon being here means YOU were the one in the chopper... There's no need to explain if you already know! Will you help? But isn't 80-20 a little unfair? Make it 60-40... - 70-30? - What a lovely song! I wonder if Mr. Suzuki will like it? Fine, 80-20... That's my Lupin! I can always count on you! So what's the plan? The press gets to see the art exhibit in Aqua Tower before it opens. I see. So we sneak in with them. And this is Aqua Tower's security info. Look over it later. - I take it you have a plan? - That's right. Say, Goemon. - Where's your Zantetsuken? - Uh, well... - What was that? - It, was, um... What? It was stolen? It's stored with other artifacts in Aqua Tower. I can't even commit seppuku without it! Oh, man... - Lupin! There's no escape! - Walk right! - You're under arrest! - Be quiet! It's late! - Oh, my home~! - Hi! Lousy commissioner! Oh, my! He fell! Zenigata Koichi I'm leaving now. You'll catch cold if you sleep out here! Why am I doing this? Thank you, Maria-chan! He should at least clean up... Is this a jutte? I'm sorry, my ancestors! What is this? A good luck charm. Your ancestors' watch. Ancestors? Spirits that protect you from bad illnesses. Thursday, July 30 I feel sick... I had too much to drink last night... This works great on hangovers!{\0c& She's sweeter than I thought! Authorized Personnel Only{\0c& Is your hangover gone? Oh, it's you. You won't make a good wife unless you practice cooking more. You're so old-fashioned. A cop on leave won't make for a good article. Don't worry. I'm here for what's in there. Let me have some. Go ahead... Ow! - Does it hurt? - Whenever it rains or it's cold out... What about you? How'd your sword get stolen? Do not ask! I have my pride! A woman, huh? You're as straightforward as ever. Ow! These are representative of the Edo culture. Notice the red color. It's quite hard to produce. Welcome! Tokyo Life's Mine Fujiko-sama and Ayanokoji Hidemaro-sama? One moment, please. You seem to have an ulterior motive. Would you like to talk to me about it? I could be of some use. As bad as that miso soup was, I'm still obliged to pay back the favor! Once upon a time, there was a lovely little girl. Her mother died shortly after giving birth to her, but she had a very nice father, so she was never, ever lonely. But, one day, the girl's house caught on fire and her father disappeared, never to be seen again. Treat me to more of your miso soup sometime. - Sir! That's... - Don't mind me! - I'm counting on you. - Yeah. Likewise. Keep up the good work. I forgot my aspirin! You are to blame for forgetting something so important. Who're you to talk? You lost your own sword. Guess I'll use this laser gun to finish things up and get to a dentist. I'm coming, Zantetsuken! Sheesh. She gives ME all the hard work... This isn't worth 80-20... You can quit if you don't like it. Yeah, yeah, I'll do it. 80-20 is OK. Body temperature abnormal. Please abstain from an unhealthy lifestyle. Yeah, yeah... Aquapolis was designed to be environmentally friendly. That's why it also uses solar energy and heat from waste incineration plants. Mr. Suzuki. I'm Mine Fujiko from Tokyo Life. - I read your magazine on a regular basis! - I'm honored! - Would you mind if I take a picture? - Not at all! Thank you! Oh! What a beautiful apartment! No, it's nothing special. This is my business room. I try to keep it as simple as possible. Blue roses! How rare! But I never imagined you'd invite me up! Wha? Fujiko! Zenigata-san? Zenigata-san! Where there's Mine Fujiko, there's Lupin! No way! Chief! Wait for me, Zenigata-san! To the success of Aquapolis! To our new future! Is something the matter? - Did you not like it? - No, it wasn't that... I'm just a little drunk... That's so not fair... Is the Zantetsuken somewhere in this room? - Hey! Keep it down a bit! - Right! What are you doing? Get out already! You never told me about this crazy situation! YOU have the patent on crazy situations! - Anyway, get out while I distract him! - Yeah, yeah... - Thank you. - Fujiko-san. You're stunning. - You're truly a living Venus. - Oh, you... - What are you doing? Please stop... - Bastard! Not so fast! Lupin! Playtime is over, Lupin the 3rd. You will return the Inui-no-Yoshinobu. Fujiko! Huh? Ow! Not again... - You done yet, Goemon? - Just a little longer! They found us out! Ow, my tooth! The recoil! I found it! Damn! Goemon! Let's scram! - This way! - No choice! - It appears to be the real thing. - Of course it is! It was in YOUR safe! How low! I'm never working with you again! Don't say that, Fujiko-chan! I even ran to your rescue! Now, then, Fujiko-kun. Will you return the Inui-no-Yoshinobu as well? - You knew? - Guess he saw through everything. Then there's no need to explain! Will you trade with me? Trade? You always end up failing but never learn your lesson... We split the Tokugawa fortune! What do you say? The Tokugawa fortune, you say? What's so funny? Eliminate them. Just let me inside! I cannot allow you inside without an invitation. I'm a police officer! - Then please show me your badge. - I didn't bring it with me! Then I must ask you to leave. - Hey! What's wrong? - Hey, you! - This way! - Hey! Stop! Say, where's this elevator headed? Don't tell me it's to our graves! You're kidding, right? I'll be OK, right? I have the Inui-no-Yoshinobu, after all! She never gives up. No funny business. - There's no escape, anyway. - Then let me ask you this. Those blue roses in Suzuki's place... Where'd you get those? Lupin! Wha? What the? Please, Fujiko! Let me kiss you before I die! You moron! This isn't the time! Quickly, Jigen! Ouch! - Pull yourself together! - There they are! This way! That's some vision you have! Why don't we quit this and go to Las Vegas to rake in the dough? Once your cavity has healed! Kill 'em. Lupin! And Fujiko! What's with the guns? What? - Let's get out of here, Maria-chan! - Chief! Don't let 'em escape! - That was close! - What the heck's going on? Michael Suzuki has shown his true colors! Stop! Let's split up here! I'm sorry I tricked you, Maria-chan! Bye! Chief! So long, Pops! Not so fast, Lupin! Hey! Maria! Zenigata-san! You scared me! This place reeks of danger. We should escape while we can. Thank you. But I HAVE to get inside here! Does it have to do with your old man? Amazing! Talk about a convenient world we live in! No way! What on earth is this? - Someone's coming! - What? Hey! You two there! Hiya! Lupin! What are YOU doing here? Something was buggin' me, so I followed that smart girl here. Anyway, you'll get caught in no time dressed like that! What? In the laboratory? Yes, sir! Lupin and two others have snuck inside! Keep watching them until I arrive. Don't let them outside. Yes, sir! - This isn't like you. Letting Lupin escape... - I apologize, sir. Mr. Suzuki. Wonderful news! We've finally found it! This is Dr. Isshiki's daughter. She currently resides in the city. Naturally, it's in her possession. This girl? - They still after us? - No, I see no one... Looks like we made it out alive... Fujiko! Sorry! We screwed up! What? What happened to Lupin? I don't know... We split up... What? Please be alright! Lupin. What exactly is this facility for? Suzuki's laboratory - a facility for state-of-the-art genetic engineering. Genetic engineering? Yep. A technology that produces things like cloned sheep and blue roses. But it also has a sinister side... - Sinister side? - Biological and bacteriological weapons. And genetic human experimentation... - Human experiments? - Shh! Not so loud, Pops! Maria. I'm going to operate on you now. So don't worry! I promise I'll save you! Am I going to die? Storage Room Nobel Prize winners, Olympic athletes, international criminals... Using their DNA, you could produce armies of powerful soldiers. In other words, it's the new business of the 21st century. Business? With whom? Armies. Gangs. Terrorist groups. And police forces. A quarter of the world's at war. There's always a demand. Unbelievable... You sure know a lot about this, Lupin... Well, you know... I need to inform the commissioner right away... Maria? My father studied genetic engineering. What? Does that mean this is... I don't know. That's what I felt before I came here... Maria. I know you're going through a lot, but it's dangerous to stay here. He's right. We're dead if we get caught again. Oh? Looks like they already found us! I promise I'll save you. Don't worry. I promise I'll save you! - Alright! Follow me! - Hold up, Pops! Don't be in such a rush! What are you going to do? That's right. Don't kill the girl. I want her alive. What the? A little TOO strong, you think? - Let's go, you two! - Right! Maria! Zenigata-san! I'm fine! It didn't hit me! Fool. I said not to kill the girl. Over here! Hurry! Maria! Not bad! They'll be like mice in a trap in there. - I leave the rest to you. - Yes, sir. Where ARE we? Is this the Sea God's palace? Zenigata-san! Your leg! - Huh? It hit me? - Let me see! - It's just a scratch! Don't worry! - Shh! Something's a-comin'! This for real? What is that thing? That's not fair! I'm parched... Police Headquarters Friday, July 31 Don't do anything funny, Pops. Suzuki has friends in high places throughout the world. You can't arrest him all by yourself. Quiet! This is a question of my beliefs. - So what are you gonna do? - I'm figuring that out. Shouldn't you be worrying more about that Maria girl? What now? Doesn't it seem strange that she was released first? Suzuki? She has some sort of secret. Suzuki must be planning to use it. Wait, Lupin! Sorry, but a thief can't honestly help an officer! Don't be like that! I'm not an officer right now! That's true. Here. Aquapolis to Open Tomorrow Politicians and businessmen from around the world arrived at Narita Airport today to attend the opening ceremony of Aquapolis in Tokyo Bay tomorrow. Mr. Michael Suzuki is personally greeting them at his Aqua Tower, where they will be staying tonight. The Metro Police has readied 2000 officers in a security measure that rivals those of UN Summits. - Let me through! - Stay back! - Maria! - No! You can't go in! - But there's someone upstairs! - Don't worry! The building's empty! What? Damn! I'm too late! I'm too late! I'm sorry! The Inui-no-Yoshinobu was stolen! How shameful! If only I had my Zantetsuken! Ow, my tooth! Saturday, August 1 Ko-chan! Landlady! Where were you last night? It was terrible! - Our apartments burned down! - What? I can't believe this! Not my apartment, too! This is... Are you awake, Isshiki Maria-kun? - I see. You look a lot like your father. - You know my father? But of course. Dr. Isshiki was a great collaborator of ours. "Was?" It's a pity. If only he had been a little wiser, he could be having a touching reunion with his daughter. What did you... What did you do to him? He worried for you until the very end. A foolish humanist, he was. Nevertheless, he was one shrewd doctor. To think he'd record his research data in these glass plates... He should've just handed it over. The doctor performed a genetic operation on you to save you from the same illness that took your mother. The operation was a success and you escaped death. But with your genetic manipulation came an unexpected side-effect. You have truly unique DNA. You know what I mean. Precognition. Precognition... This DNA is superb. With this ability, my soldiers will be invincible. His research was worth it! No! I'm sure my father wanted to save others from that illness! Of course he did. Thanks to his wonderful humanism, my goods will sell for much more! I'm grateful to the two of you! Here's something you'll like. Your egg cells will be used to create hordes of clones. It's the birth of a new product! So you will remain alive, as a product sample. Open Today The much-talked-about Aquapolis opened today to a crowd of over 150,000 visitors. The opening party is currently underway inside Aqua Tower. - You understand? - Yes! Yes! Thanks for coming. Oh! Michael Suzuki! - Another drink, Commissioner? - No, no! Thanks, but I'm on duty... No one would dare sneak in with the Metro Police on guard. But rules ARE rules... - Oh? What was that sound? - The fireworks probably started. We, the Black Comets, have taken control of the building! What? You're all hostages! Try any heroics and we'll kill you on the spot! What? Aqua Tower's been taken over? I'm at Aquapolis. International VIPs are being held hostage, and tensions are running high. The identity of the group responsible is unknown. Aside from their demands for a large sum of money and a getaway jet, we have no other details. "Government agrees to hijackers' demands, will pay ransom." It's the jet! The Self-Defense Force has brought in the jet the group demanded! The Japanese government has given in to all of our demands. Therefore, we will release you as promised. However! One of you will come with us to guarantee our safety! - That wasn't part of the agreement! - Yes! Let everyone go! Suzuki-san! Fireworks have suddenly gone off! - You'll stand out dressed like that, Goemon! - This is my trademark. I forgot my aspirin! The fireworks appear to be over! What could this signify? Aqua Tower Hijack According to our latest information, the hijackers have taken Michael Suzuki hostage and boarded the getaway jet. I'm in front of Aqua Tower's main entrance! The hostages were released moments ago, but many guards were injured and Mr. Suzuki's condition is unknown. Oh! Who could that be? Someone is chasing the hijackers on a motorcycle! Zenigata-kun! Where could the jet be headed? The hotel owner is taken hostage to protect the other VIPs... - The media will treat me like a hero. - You know you don't need me anymore! - Just kill me already! - I already told you. I have no need for you, but I DO need your egg cells. Plus, I still need to determine how the precognition works. I can't sell a product that can't foresee things on demand. You used your thugs to act out your play and swindle ransom money from the government. Who's there? It's a scenario that makes NO sense to me. Zenigata-san! I can't dishonor my ancestors and let you have your way! So cool! It's an honor to have such a rare guest! Extend him a polite greeting. Ouch! Give me some warning, you jerk! Zenigata-san! Move! I have everything under... Zenigata-san! Don't worry! I can't die until I've had more of your miso soup! We're going to tilt! What's happening? - What's the matter? - The control stick came off! - What? - Here you go! You! Tadah! Morning, Suzuki-kun! Lupin! When did you... Oh, that control stick will self destruct! - Someone go check it out! - Yes, sir! - Zenigata-san! - Whoa! Thank you! - Are you all right, Maria? - Yeah! Oh! Good for you, Pops! Lupin! I come at a bad time? - This is gonna be one gaudy attraction! - Isn't that how it always is? What? The jet's coming back? We have an emergency! Call everyone back from HQ! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! We're counting on you, Zenigata-kun! THAT was a cinch! No way! What the? This is bad, Goemon! The Zantetsuken is gone! What? I found 'em! In here! Let's scram! Where did they hide my Zantetsuken? Don't ask me! You sure it didn't fall somewhere? I found it! - I got it! - I got it! - Shall we take care of business? - Yes! - Let us go, Jigen. - Yeah. - I hafta throw this tooth onto the roof. - That is only for baby teeth. Huh? Yeesh! I shoulda brought an axe! Zenigata-san! Above you! - Thanks for the tip! - It's precognition! Right! Let him go! Come on! Maria! I'll kill all three of you! Stop it! Such emotion! Maria! Once I kill you three, everything will be back to normal! Sorry, but we already took your glass plates. Fool! Those were fakes! Hold on tight! Die, Lupin! Bastard! Impossible! - That was close! - It's too early to say that, Pops! I know that! A last-second save... - Think you can land it? - Like I have any choice! - How's our landing gear? - No good. It won't come out. Hold on tight! Zenigata-kun! Damn! It won't stop! It stopped! We did it! Huh? Sunday, August 2 Aquapolis Hijacking The Metro Police Department continues its investigation at Aqua Tower, which was commandeered last night. I'm at the scene of the plane crash! One of the hijackers was found among the bodies recovered. However, Mr. Suzuki is still missing and his condition is unknown. Identity confirmed. You appear to be exhausted. Gentlemen. Sorry for the wait. Let us begin our trade. Where's Mr. Suzuki? Yes! We can't trade without him! There's no need to worry. You're... - Mr. Suzuki! Well? What did you think of my demonstration? Incredible! Very impressive! It would've been perfect had the jet not crashed! My nation would like to place an order! This is some nice work you do! - Lupin! What are YOU doing here? - Came to get something I forgot! Is THIS what you forgot? No, not quite! These are them! Bye, now! Damn it! Stop, Lupin! Charge! Give yourself up, Michael Suzuki! We've uncovered your entire plan! We've also recovered the ransom money from the Swiss account and begun investigating your lab! Michael Suzuki! You're under arrest! How did you know my real identity? That reminds me, Zenigata-kun! - I have a present for you! - Huh? - Put out your hands! - Alright... Commissioner! - You are now back on the force! - Commissioner! Thank you! Maria! Are you crazy? What if it had been loaded? I guess I'll let him off with that. I see. You knew it wasn't loaded... Now the Tokugawa fortune is ours! Lupin-chan!
