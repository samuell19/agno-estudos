September 1944 Northern France. The Allies had landed. Paris was liberated. I should have been overjoyed, But I could think only of my son Théo, and the heartache which I was going to bring him. And yet in this month of September 1944, I could not yet foresee that I'd turn his life upside down, and finally put an end to his happy and carefree childhood. Are you Canadian, sir? Yes. Quebec itself. And are you staying here? No no, we're going to turn back, we're only a patrol. The Germans are not far from here. we can hear them, eh? Theo! Theo, come here, hurry up. -Mom! This is it, they've come. They've followed the coast from Calais, and then, they'll go to Belgium. That's very good, it's good, but I'd prefer you came home, it may be dangerous. What's the matter, you don't look happy? Yes, of course I am. But a war doesn't just end like that. (Doctor of Medicine) Here's the latest news from the front. U.S. troops continue their advance towards Dunkirk, But at the approach of Boulogne the second Canadian regiment... has encountered German resistance. What's the matter, Mom? Did Madame Van Lier's delivery go badly? No, it went very well, it was long, but it's a beautiful little boy. What's the matter, then? Theo, listen to me. Do you trust me? I guess so. Will you always trust me? Of course, why? Everything I do is for the memory of your father. I know, why are you telling me this? You're young now, Theo. We've shared so much over the past four years. But there are things that I can't tell you yet. One day I'll tell you everything, I promise. Don't worry. I hear you take your bike at night I've never asked any questions. The Canadians are retreating. You were right, the war's not over yet. Again. Come away, come away. Paris was liberated, but not France. Theo, if ever something happens, you know where the money is, there's your grandpa in Paris. What could happen to me? I don't know. We could be separated. Not long, a few days, but... but with the war you never know. I love you, Theo. I love you, never forget that. I love you too. -You have the documents? -Yes. It's dynamite. The entire nazi network is in there. Perfect. Look out. I'll pass them on tomorrow. Are you sure you haven't been followed? I took precautions. Are you sure you can hold out? Yes, if you promise to watch over Theo. I will do everything I can. He's not aware of anything. Things can go wrong. Kurt, I'm afraid for him, he's so young. Mom, get up quickly, the French. Are you Dr. Valmore? Yes. You can lower your weapons, you're among friends. Yes? that's not what we heard. -But what's wrong, are there wounded? -You're coming with us. -No, but... -We're leaving. Wait, this is a mistake. I must speak to him. Theo! My mother's in the resistance. Theo, go to your grandpa. Mom. Mom. Clear the way. Come here, you. Mom. Stop, that's my mother. Stop! Mom. -Come on, Theo. -Get off me! -Come on, this is not for you. -Let go of me. Mom! -Stop! Mom! -It seems she sleeps with the Boche. Come on, that's enough. Go on. You have no right, my mother was in the resistance. Get out the way. Move it, come on. And my father, he died in battle, he was even decorated. It's true, your father was a hero. But that didn't stop your mother from sleeping with a Kraut. She even did much worse. Worse. How do you mean worse? Do you remember when the Gestapo arrested the Calais lawyer with his entire network, at the end of July. -What about it? She had nothing to do with it. -Really? Well, it was your mother who denounced them. Come on, go home. -Go on. Is someone there? Don't say anything, Theo, I'm a friend, I'm Kurt. Did your mother tell you about me? Don't touch me. She told me not to trust anyone. And me, she made me promise to watch over you. It's not true, is that why you made all this mess, to protect me. No, it wasn't me who did it. We must get you to safety. You won't see your mother again for a long time. Safe from what? For a start, you're German. Theo, Theo. You're quite sure that it's her? Yes, sir, Adeline Valmore. Yes, that's right, Adeline Valmore. Take care of her immediately. Very good, sir, at your service, sir. Okay, put Adeline Valmore in cell 32. In 32, with the other criminal? She hasn't even killed anyone, this Valmore. If we were to put all those who've slept with Germans in high-security. She denounced a resistance network, is that enough for you? What are you doing here, then? This isn't a cell for the shorn. If they put you here, it's not just because you fucked a Kraut. Eh? Eh? But maybe they put you here to spy on me, to make me talk. Answer. You're beautiful all the same you know. Thank you. Well, you're not very talkative. What did you do? -And you? If you want us to get on together, you don't ask questions. Got it? Scare you? There's no point, it's like this every day. What do you do for a living? I'm a doctor. Doctor of what? Everything. In the country one must know how to do everything, even surgery. That's so worthwhile. Do I frighten you. Well, you're right. Because I'll tell you one good thing, the war isn't over. The Germans have some little secret weapons and will return. So then. So then what? They’ll all have to pay. Every one. What do you think, that I've a score to settle, too. Why didn't you tell me the truth? Hey, you two, move it. -What are you talking about? -I know what you did at Calais. Watch out for her, she's a bitch, a real Gaullist. When I was little, I was always fighting with the boys, you can't imagine. I know it was you who snitched on the resistance network at Calais, well done! How do you know that? I have friends, even here. Anyway it's no use, we're screwed. No, the war isn't over, you'll see. Okay, back inside. What are you doing here? Wait. Hey, can you hear me? Are you hurt? -Ouch! -Sorry. -Who are you? -I'm Theo. The explosion... there was an explosion. What about my grandma? The explosion, was a mine. So... she... I'm sorry, it's the war. -I want to see my grandma. -No, you can't. There are other mines on the beach, it's dangerous. -I don't care, I want to see her. -No, you can't. You've been lucky, just a tiny sliver. You must go back to your parents. I have no parents. They were killed in the bombing. I have nobody anymore. It's not pretty, we must clean it, otherwise it'll become infected. My name is Marie. Marie Van Loo. What happened here, was there a fight? What about you, what were you doing on the beach? We fled Dunkirk. The Germans are still there, you know, so everyone fled. My grandma knew a way to cross the lines. Ah, here's my mom's case. But where's the disinfectant? Ah... here it is. Does it sting? It's not likely to sting, as there's none left. What is it? It looks like German. Do you speak German? No, but it certainly looks like German. Signed Kurt. This may be a love letter? Did you mother have a German lover? My mom supported de Gaulle. Is this how you look after me? I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Where are your parents? Don't you have any either? My father died at the beginning, He's over there. And my mother, She's in the resistance, she has to hide. She's beautiful, she has beautiful hair. She had beautiful hair. I no longer have a photo of my mom, but I'll see her in my head forever. We mustn't stay here, it's too dangerous. You know, if my mom hid these documents, they must be important. We don't want the police to find them. Wait, I can't walk so fast. Where are we going first? I'm going to my grandpa's. I have to tell him about my mom, and the documents as well. -He'll know what to do. -Does your grandpa live far? -Paris. -In Paris? You want to walk to Paris? Do you know how long it takes to do 300 Kms on foot? If an average man does 4 Km per hour, that means... That means you're not obliged to follow me, Madam know it all. You do what you want. I'll come with you, you need me. Need you? That's a good one! To do what? -Well, we don't know. I can sew, I can dance, I know how to cook and I even know a little Latin. Well, with that we're well set. You're not gonna leave me here, I don't know anyone. Look, it won't be fun, we'll have to walk for a long time. You yourself said that. I don't care, I don't want to go to welfare services. To begin with you're too small, and you're a girl. I swear I won't bother you. If you want I can dress like a boy. As a boy? You haven't seen your hair. Here, cut it. Cut your hair? Out of the question. Yes, if you want, go ahead, cut it. -No, I can't. -Why? Come on, we must hurry. Thank you. Theo, I need to ask you something. What now? I'd like to go and see my grandma at the cemetery. I beg you. Okay, but not for long though. We've got a long way to go. Thank you. Let's go. Your grandmother wouldn't like to see you sad. It was her who taught me everything, as I couldn't go to school. You never went to school? When the Germans arrived, she didn't want to let me out. She was scared. So you've never been out for four years? Never. Look at her grave, she doesn't even have any flowers, that she loved so much. Here and there, they're everywhere. The dead won't say anything if we take a few. No. Finished your walk, Theo, you must come with us. Why? I've done nothing. You'll find out, your mother too, she looked like a saint. How can I help you? I am looking for the works of Terence. -Terence? -Yes, the Latin comic author. I'd like "Andria". -You're expected. -Thank you. You're on time. You promised Adeline to protect her son. Where is he? Don't worry about it. We'll take care of him. What does that mean? You take insane risks with Adeline and you forget about her son. I need to know. And me, I need to know where the documents have gone. What, you don't have them? It's not possible. It was the entire escape network of the heads of the Gestapo for Argentina, with all the addresses and bank accounts. And Adeline had to hand them to the chap who came to arrest her. This is what you agreed with her, right? Indeed. But those who came to arrest her weren't the right ones, so she gave them nothing. We searched the whole house, everywhere. Nothing! There's only her son, Theo. Unless you never gave these documents to Adeline. You also work for the U.S. Secret Service, don't you? If you doubt me, why don't you ask Adeline? But that's just what we'll do, as soon as she contacts us. I warned Adeline against your idea of arresting her. It was too risky a calculation. And furthermore, you weren't forced... to spread the rumor that she'd denounced a resistance network. It was the only way to gain the trust of the others, and maybe infiltrate their network. I've found a way out of here. How's that? Yes, to break out of here. Don't worry, everything's arranged. But it's impossible, even if we manage to get out of here, they'll catch us as soon as we get outside. Everything is arranged I tell you. My guy is a right arm of the Gestapo. He has many contacts. And this time it might work. But only if you help me. How do I help you? I'll tell you. Help! help! -What's wrong? -She has pain, sudden stabbing pains. We must do something immediately, we need to find a doctor. But there's one in the cell next door, you can call her, she's a doctor. Valmore, get up! Do you hear me? Get a move on, doctor, you have to treat an emergency, next door. Eh! Garbage collection! You've no right to keep me here. Look, Theo, there are orders from on high, very high even in the department. First of all, why did you take that kid hostage? Hostage, Marie? -Tied up for two days. -That's not true. -Shut up, she told us everything. -It's not possible. You tortured her to get her to tell you stories like that. We're not Nazis, or friends of Nazis. So if you talk about torture you'll remember until your death, if you're lucky enough to live until then. Son of a bitch. Little Marie, at least she's nice. My wife had to keep her for treatment. As for you, my lad, We're gonna lock you up pending orders from Paris. Come on. Marie, what are you doing? Excuse me ma'am, I have to go pee. Take the torch there, otherwise you'll fall over. Is that you? Dirty brat. You're crazy. Why would you say that to the police? To get us out of here, idiot. You see how you need me. Come on. Hello. You brought in the young Valmore yesterday, the doctor's son. Yes, sir. You still have him there? Yes, of course. Guard him well, we'll be there tomorrow morning. You didn't tell me that your mother was in prison. How do you know that? The sergeant's wife told me. Even that your mother's no longer in prison. What do you mean? I mean that your mother's escaped. Even the sergeant said that's proof because when you've nothing to hide, you have faith in justice. He's just talking bullshit. Come on. Here we are, Paris. Both of us, are you happy? Where are we? Is it safe? Yes, don't worry, everything will be fine. Anyway it's not long term, it's just a temporary hideout. These guys here, are they dumb or what? -No. -It's as expected. They are cautious, they don't talk much, they act. Oh, just relax, come on. We'll stay together, don't worry, eh. You're even more beautiful now we're free. You must obey, everyone knows what they have to do here, understand? Come on, there's an emergency. Okay. I understand why I'm here. For him or others, you don't think we just got you out because of your beautiful eyes, eh? I like them a lot, I must say. Our doctor was arrested, and hospital is out of the question. It's not pretty, the bullet's still inside. Is it very infected? Yes, it looks like gangrene. I don't understand, I thought the fighting was finished in Paris. The gangrene is your business, for the rest you ask no questions and you look after him, he's an important guy. Otherwise we'd have left him to die. Who is he exactly? I told you not to ask questions. Don't you trust me? Of course, but the others, I know them, they're wary. You'll have to prove yourself. I had to stay calm, keep cool, but it was difficult. The game was far from won. And then I couldn't stop thinking about Theo and his horrified face while I was shorn on the village square. Hello... I have a gift for you, my dear. Here. What is it? Try it, I think it should fit you. There now... you're more beautiful than ever. Don't you think? Thank you. Clothing. A blouse. Come on, get changed. So... A jacket. Skirt. stockings... assorted, and... shoes. And... You want to photograph me? What for? For your false papers, it's what's most urgent. Because the cops are looking for Adeline Valmore but not Anne Vionet. -What did you say? -Anne Vionet. We always keep the same initials. Stand there against the wall. In the light, look at me. A little smile. That's it. And you were born in Dunkirk, as our people are still there, the cops can't check. But I was born in Dunkirk. Well, so much the better, that way you can't go wrong. Here. Do you think they'll hold out long at Dunkirk? Of course. Contrary to what a lot of idiots think, Germany's position isn't so bad, eh? It seems that Hitler's preparing a new secret weapon. Are you aware of that? Of course. You know why the allies are no longer advancing? Because they wanted to go too fast, the refueling couldn't keep up. And the Germans got their second wind, They're preparing a counter offensive in the Ardennes. You see, I'm sure we chose the right card. -Why did you play this card? -Me? I was tired of being humiliated by idiots. Humiliated how?. Before the war, I had nothing to eat, so... so I had to sleep with idiots, I prefer sleeping with idiots who are powerful. Anyway, I don't care they're Nazis. And you? Why are you with us? I was in love with a German before the war. They did everything to separate us. You haven't found him? Yes, finally, almost. In the meantime, I'll take care of you and me. Hey, Marcelle, lunch is ready. Learn it off by heart, you're a beautician okay? Hey, you didn't tell me you had a son. That isn't nice. How do you know that? What do you think? We're well organized. We've been doing a tour of your hometown. We know that the police took him in, and then he escaped. How did he escape, and why was he imprisoned, to begin with? Put yourself in their place. They may be eager to know more about his mother. When you hold the son, you hold the mother. Marcelle, do you know where he is? No, not at all, see you later. No, wait, I'm coming with you, please, I don't want to be alone. It's not possible, they don't want it. What don't they want? Who's in command here, is it you or not? Could I have the bread, please? Didn't you hear? Look, Theo, can we sleep in there? It's a school. Well precisely, there's nobody here at night. Okay, back up. You think it's funny? In American movies that's how they open doors. Well, I've never been to the cinema? It doesn't work. Can't you see they've been bombed here. We'll settle down on the stage. It'll be less humid. Look at these books. He's eclectic, this teacher. He's what? Eclectic, that means, he has a very wide selection. Books for children and also for adults. I knew what it meant, but you mumble. I think your mother liked this German. What do you know? My mom hated the boche. Yes, but maybe he was a good one. It can happen. What about my father? She wasn't able to forget him. You know, you can fall in love twice. In novels you often see things like that. You read too many novels, at your age, it's not normal. Come on, let's sleep. It's Anna Karenina, this is the book I was reading when we had to leave. There's an old lady in it, Madame Tiersbasku, she's a lot like my grandma. I told you to go to sleep, madam know it all. Tomorrow you'll tell me that you're tired again. -Not so fast Theo, I'm tired. -Hurry up. Quick, soldiers. Colt? Colt! Colt? Colt? No, he's dead. It's not fair, Theo. I know, death isn't fair. Aren't you going to pray for him? I don't know any prayers. Well, finally something you don't know. Why don't you know your prayers? Because... Because what? Because I'm Jewish. My grandma made me swear not to tell anyone. Is that why she locked you up for four years? She didn't lock me up, she hid me. She knew that the Germans hurt the Jews. All those who were taken, we never heard from them again. She was right, my grandma. I'll tell you one thing, Jesus was a Jew. Arabs, Blacks and Indians, are all men, like the Jews and Christians. My mother always said that. I like your mother, I'd like her. -Oh, Marcelle... -Health and happiness! Please, I'm suffocating here, I can't stand it, it's worse than prison. And also the guy with glasses, there, he scares me. Lucien? He came up to see you? What did he want? What do you think he wanted? I'll have a few words with him. If only you trusted me. Listen... later on, I'll have a message to carry, a letter to a friend. We can't use the mail, you understand, because of censorship. It should be Lucien, but... like this you'll see that I trust you. Eh? Okay. It's still more enjoyable than kissing a man, right? I have an appointment with M. George for a perm. Is it your natural shade, ma'am? No, I was brown, but my husband prefers it like this. Fine. Good, we'll try to arrange it. If you'd like to go next door, please. That's it. I'll see if M. George is here. Wait here. He's coming. Do you have something to make steam? Open this as cleanly as possible and bring it to me. -But... -Please, hurry. Valmore, finally. What information do you have for me? It's you who'll give it to me. I want to know where my son is. Listen, when I accepted this mission, you promised to take care of him. Instead, I hear that you arrested him. What's this all about? Sit down, I'll explain everything. No, I don't want your explanations. I don't want to continue under these conditions. I'm stopping everything You've no right to do that. You don't have the right to dispose of the life of my son. I chose this life, not him. He never should have been involved in any of this, ever. We're at war, Valmore, I'm sorry. Things don't always go as planned, but I promise we'll do everything to find Theo. What happened? Why wasn't it Mercier who came to arrest me? Because he was killed the day before by the Germans. That fool Lefranc, an 11th hour resistance fighter, really thought it was you who had denounced the Calais network. You know what I owe to your 11th hour resistance fighter? Listen Valmore, when you accepted this mission, you knew all the risks. You're not going to give up now that you've done the hardest part. Thank you. They're suspicious, it's normal. She's much smarter than you think. No, I know, she knows all the tricks in four years. This is one of the worst enemies of the resistance. She's wreaked havoc in our ranks. Have you learned anything about their network? Not yet. It'll take more time. have you retrieved the documents? We searched everywhere, nothing. I put them in my bag, in a bottle. It's possible Theo took them. -That's what we thought, too. That's why the police brought him in. He's been reported in various locations including near Bethune. Don't worry Valmore, we'll eventually find him. Your infiltration was successful, but the first duty of an intelligence agent, is to survive. Thank you for the advice. I'm counting on you, Valmore, we absolutely must know where these Nazis gather to leave their country and France. Don't come here anymore. Behind the church of Saint Sulpice, there's a small bookstore. This will be your contact. Ask for the works of Terence. The Andria. Will you remember? He'll understand. I know how you feel, Valmore, One of my sons was executed by the Gestapo, six months ago. I'm sorry. Stop, stop, stop. She's betrayed us, your doctor. I told you so, eh? She ran at the first opportunity. Did you make a mistake there, old girl. Mistake! It wasn't hard to see that she wasn't with us, that bitch. Don’t you see she takes the piss out of us and she plays her new card. She'll double cross us, Marcelle. Shut up, you're talking nonsense, I'm sure she'll come back. But tell me, what happened to you, my little Marcelle? You know you've not been the same since you brought this little sweetheart home. Because of your bullshit, we'll have to change hideout. We’re risking our necks. Good evening. Satisfied? I think for once you'll have the unique opportunity to finally do your job. Come on, out, out. -Where were you? -I took a walk. Finally, as soon as I managed to lose your guy in the cap there not very smart, that one. Charlie was there to protect you. To protect me? You should have warned me, eh? -You did what? -I went to post the letter. It's easy to check. I know, I wanted to get some fresh air, I needed some air. You understand? No, I don't understand. Are you reckless or what? Don't you know you can get caught anywhere, at any time, eh? Is it for me that you're scared, or for yourself? Do you still doubt me? Yes, but you must admit there's reason, eh? If you want. Honestly, do you think I wanted to come back to this rat hole? If I returned, it's only for you. My head. It hurts, here. I'll have a look, calm down. Not lie, I know me very sick. Shh, quiet. I don't see anything. Listen Adeline he's big, a very big fish, bigger than mine, it's absolutely essential to cure him. Okay? But your big fish, it's in the head that he's sick. He has a terror, that's upsetting him more than anything else. What did he say? Not much. He says that the others haven't won the war yet. What do you think since the German offensive in the Ardennes failed? It's over, right? Action southwest. Southwest? For the high-ups only. And after Spain? He'll rouse the whole building. Calm this guy down, for Gods sake. I'm going make him sleep. Stop a moment. Theo. What's up? I'm tired, I can't go on. I told you it was too hard for a girl. Come on. I'm hungry. I'm very hungry. I'm hungry too. We'll stop in the next village, at the bakery. Come on, Marie. -Hey, look where you're going. -Who's this? And not even an apology. Give it back. Catch! -Stop it or I'll kill you! -Here. It was a joke. Lucas, aren't you ashamed? Always bullying children. I'll tell the police the next time. I'm proud of you, Theo, you're my hero. No need to exaggerate. You saw their fear, eh? They were afraid. They sensed you wouldn't hesitate, like Cyrano de Bergerac. Who? Or better still, like Dayan, without fear and without reproach. You'll see later we'll both be happy together. Look. It was the others who attacked us anyway. They can't blame us. Yes, but it's better not to get too close to the police. Wait for me, Theo. Excuse me, sir, where's this bus going? Can't you read? Paris, sonny boy. And yes, my son was a hero and I didn't even know. I was far from suspecting that he'd succeed in crossing all the north of France, and thwart so many traps. On arriving in Paris, he thought he was out of trouble, but the hardest part was about to begin. Look out, Maurice, can't you pay attention. Come on, drive. Does your grandpa live far? I'm tired. No, we'll be there soon, hurry up. What do you want? -M. Louis Valmore, please. -He no longer lives here. Wait. Can you give me his new address? I'm his nephew. I came to Paris expressly to see him. What makes you think he left me his address. He disappeared without a word, just before libération, as if he had something to be ashamed of. Yes, a strange time. And you're not the only one looking for him, and what's more it seemed suspicious to me. There was this man with a strong German accent, and then the other, a French one. He was looking for a kid your age. Maybe it was you after all? Me? He looked like the police, that one. You should go to the police. Maybe they can help you find your grandpa? Well, she didn't seem to like your grandpa much. What are we going to do Theo? I don't know. Couldn't you keep him one more day? We've a departure this evening, you understand. Who's that one? The doctor? You're crazy to have brought her here. It's his fault, he wouldn't let her go. That's not a reason. So? He doesn’t seem any better. His pulse is very high. Too bad, come on, we must go. We can't leave him like that. We should have left already, come quickly. Stay with me, Madame. With me, you'll go with me to Bayonne. Please stay. -He can't stop yelling. Are the others also going to Bayonne? Don't be so curious. But I really trust you, otherwise. Why aren't we leaving with them? Later, we must return to Paris, I expect other travellers with other documents. Come on, hurry. Stay. So youngsters, can I get you anything? Two Bovril soup, sir. It's not the real thing, but it's hot. Please, would it be possible to have some bread without a coupon? You got the money? Okay, wait. How did you know? Did you see how he looked at the money. That's all that matters to him. -Here you are, that'll be 200 francs. -200? Well, it's that or nothing sunshine. Where are we going to sleep? I don't know. There's hardly any money left. Hello, hello, you'll be happy to know I found the penicillin we were lacking. How did you do it, it's unobtainable in the trade? Yes, but there are Americans. And it's you who'll get it. Where is it? A pharmacy in Faubourg St, Saint-Antoine. There's only one so you can't go wrong. Ask for M. Raoul, he'll give you a bottle, on the quiet. And you check, eh? Don't come back with a bottle of aspirin he's flogged you. Pronto, not like last time. It puts my nerves me on edge. Excuse me, I'm looking for the works of Terence. Terence? The latin comic author. I'd like the Andria. They told me you'd visit. Come this way. Sit down. -You have something to tell me? -Do you have news of my son Theo? Your son Theo, no. They haven't told me about him. I'm listening. Senior Nazi officials no longer believe in victory, they're deserting Hitler. They're starting to go off on the sly towards Bayonne, and from there towards Spain and Portugal, and then towards South America. Their meeting point is in a mansion in the countryside, on the road to Poitiers, near Algrande, you'll remember? A mansion on the road to Poitiers. Near Algrande. Yes, continue. In this house, there's currently a very important leader of the Gestapo. But he comes and goes, we should act quickly. Yes, this information is invaluable. They will be happy, it'll be a big catch. They'll congratulate you. I don't care about their congratulations. All I want is to find my son. I talk to them, I promise you. I understand you, you know, you've been rather audacious. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to come and see me. -Thank you. -But, be careful. Gentlemen, can I help you? Well, but the Blessed Virgin has just given me two children. Excuse me, sir, we fell asleep. We had no money to go to a hotel. Don't bother to ask for forgiveness, it's always in the shadow of the Lord that sleep the righteous and children. And when they're hungry, does he feed them? Well, it looks like you havn't eaten for days. -Since Bethune. -Since Bethune? And are you alone in Paris? We came to see my grandpa, but he wasn't there, so... So you thought that the Good Lord would take you in. And you were absolutely right. We'll see if we can find you somewhere to live, while waiting for Grandpa, eh? And what are your names? My name's Theo, and she's Marie. Hail Mary. And now you should write to your grandpa to tell him that you're here, so he finds your letter when he returns home. Well I must go, the faithful await me. Eat up, eh? Don't leave anything. Hey there, lady, where are you going? To M. Valmore, he's my father-in-law. He's no longer here. Well, it's strange that everyone's looking for him. There was even a kid who said he was his grandfather. A kid, when was that? I don't know, I'm not the police. Do you know where he went? Did he say anything? I told you I'm not the police, eh! My last hope to find Theo had just been dashed. I knew now that he was in Paris, but where? My only recourse was to warn the secret services. -Where is she? -She didn't return. You amaze me. She's betrayed us this bitch, she's on the other side, your Adeline. She works for the French secret service. -Come on, this isn't possible. -Yes, it's possible. We distrusted her since the beginning, but obviously, you see nothing, you're blind, you're crazy about her. We should never have worked with a dyke. Shut up. What happened? We followed her as far as her contact. A cheesy little bookseller near Saint-Sulpice St. Fortunately we arrived in time. It took us two hours to get him to talk. The bookseller finally cracked. She told him everything, everything, understand, but he can no longer tell anyone. And you don't know the worst. Just before dying the old man squealed she knows where the documents are. But what documents? The documents we expected, bank accounts, addresses, everything. -We must find her son. -You must be joking! We must find her son. Once we have the kid, we'll have a little chat, and that I can guarantee you, eh. -Afterwards you can do what you want. -We have to find him first. And in the meantime we must get out before she reports us to anyone else. Okay, warn Philippe, tell him we're coming right away. -He worked for the resistance. -Such a nice man. Straightforward. Move along, nothing to see. One word and I'll kill you. Move back. We arrived in time. One minute more, she'd have given us up. You think it's funny, bitch? You made a fool of me, but it's over. Now tell me where the documents are. You hear me? I want the documents. What documents? You still want to play games? You still don't understand who you're dealing with. Right, go on then. Show her. Stop, stop, I tell you. Come on. They want to kill you, you know. I can help you only it's imperative... that you tell me where the documents are hidden. They're nothing to you, you owe them nothing. I'm tired, I'm tired of these idiots. The two of us can go to South America. With your money plus the bank accounts, we'll have their money and take it easy. I can even help you find your son. Just trust me, shit, trust me. I'm sorry, Marcelle. I don't know what documents you mean. Because your little bookseller, he told us everything. I thought you were less stupid. And when we have your son, eh? [Dear Grandpa, I'm in Paris, I'm staying with the priest of the church of St...] Okay, children behave yourselves, eh? I must do my rounds of the sick. And if you get bored, you've only to read the Gospels. Yes, Father. Saint Jean of Montmartre. Montmartre isn't written like that, It's spelled with a "t", mount as in mountain, a little mountain. I know that, and you, you're a big mountain of knowledge. You know, it'd be great if we climbed to the top of the bell tower.. We'd see all of Paris from up there. Look Theo, communion candles. What if we sold them? It'd be a good deed don't you think, Everybody complains about power cuts. -That'd be theft. -No it wouldn't Each time we sold one, we'd give a coin to the poor, that way everyone will be happy. What's with all these candles? -We're selling them, sir. -For the benefit of the poor. Your selling them? I'm very interested, and how much are they? -8 Fr each. -Minimum, but you can give more to the poor. Okay, I'll take them all. -All? Is it for a ball, a big party? Yes, it is. For me it's a party every night. I have a circus. The Marchiano circus. As you're so nice, you'll sell them to me at 7.50 each, eh? Agreed? Let's say you have 50 here, 50 times 7.50 fr = 375 fr. Well I say, you're good at sums! You could do an act with Marchiano. So, let's say, 350. There you are, children. Hey, our cart! You can collect it tonight, eh! You're the guests of Marchiano circus, I'll expect you at 9 p.m. sharp, at the entrance of the wood, Porte de Vincennes, and I've reserved two seats for you in the front row. Friends of Greater Paris, good evening, The Marchiano Circus hosted before the war by the biggest capitals of Europe, is happy to finally be able to return to the roads of France, to bring to the cities most affected, joy, to Orleans, Poitiers, Dour, and so on. But before leaving our beautiful capital liberated by her people, The Marchiano circus is proud to present these brand new acts. And to begin with, I present to you, the best dancer of all time, Let me introduce, my daughter, Isabelle Marchiano. She's beautiful. Magnificent you mean. Sit down you're bothering everyone. Sit down. Watch out! Isabelle! Everything's okay, more fear than harm. On with the show. That's enough, Theo. Hey, just now you said that she was beautiful. Yes, but that was earlier. Come on, we're going. It's not over. Come on. You'll see, she'll kick us out again. Not if my grandpa's returned. Look. (Back in 5 minutes) What do we do? We come back in five minutes. Theo, finally I've found you. Don't be afraid, Theo. I'm not a policeman, I'm really a friend of your mother. Do you know where she is? I'd give a lot to know. But she asked me to protect you. I don't need anybody. She didn't tell me about you. Yet she told me everything. It was too dangerous. You must come with me. Let him go, or I'll shoot. Who are you, my dear? I said, let go of him. Theo. At least tell me if you have the papers, the documents I gave to your mother. Theo! Theo! -Where did you get that revolver? -What does it matter? -Answer me! -Let go, you're hurting me. It was at the sergeants house. You might have killed us, me or him. Even both. Still, I haven't killed anyone and he let you go, this Kurt. He's rather handsome, don't you think? I understand your mother. What about my mother? -To have sex with him. -Shut up. At your age you shouldn't even know that word. And at your age, if you'd read more novels, you'd know that there's always love in life. I don't understand any of it. My mother, this Kurt, my grandpa who's disappeared. Don't worry Theo, everything will work out. And I love you. We'll have to leave, Marie. Leave, but why? We're alright with the priest, aren't we? Yes, but it's no longer safe there. If the concierge called the police, because of this revolver and Kurt, they'll find the letter that I sent with our address. That's a shame, I liked the priest. What are we going to do? We'll go to my aunt Lucie in Touraine. She's sure to let us stay. How are we going to get to Touraine? We've no money. I may have an idea. All the same, it's two more stomachs to feed. We've enough trouble like that. Oh, listen, Dad, without him, I might be dead. You may be right, accidents can so easily happen. -What do you want? -I want to see Marcelle. Marcelle? What do you want? To tell you what you want to know. You're right, I don't care about these documents, all I want is to live and find my son. Do you still want to help me? Then we'll leave together, okay? I'm listening. I know where the documents are. I gave them to a friend of my husband. -And where is he? -In Paris. I'll have to go and see him. He'll only give them to me. And you think I'll let you leave, do you take me for a fool? Why don't you come with me, with them, as well, if you want. You'll see that I'm not lying. Marcelle, I beg you. Trust me, one more time. One last time. Okay. But if you're messing me about, you'll have to deal with Lucien. Okay, gentlemen. Is he your husbands friend? No, it's his partner. Then you're going to go in very sweetly and ask to see him. But you stay in full view, understand? Lucien fires very quickly and I guarantee you he won't hesitate. Don't look out the window. Give this message to M. George. the meeting place of the Nazis is a manor house... on the road to Poitiers, near Algrande, There's a departure tonight, act quickly. Thanks, escape that way, at the rear. Let her go. You stay quiet. Come on. Get up. -Where's Marcelle? -Quiet down! Quiet down! We're here to talk, okay? Alright I'm going to slowly remove my hand from your mouth, and if you have the misfortune to open it, I'll smash your face. Is that clear? There you are, you see you can be a good girl if you want to be. Are you scared of me? Little bitch, you think you can screw with us like that, do you think we're fucking blind, perhaps? I'll tell you one thing, it's us who'll fuck you and I swear we'll enjoy it. C'mon baby, C'mon. Enjoy yourself. Come on. Come on boys, let's play nicely. It's over, it's finished with them, it's over, it's over. We'll meet again. Calm down, it's me who decides, don't worry, nothing will happen to you. Calm down. Come on, it's over now, it's over. Is this where M. Valmore lives? Again, who are who you, his nephew? No, I'm looking for his nephew. He showed up this morning, you should go look in the café across the street. Alone in Paris at his age, it's just not right. Thank you. Well sir, you win. Bravo! Have a drink on me. Nice candles here. Some kids sold them to me. -Kids? -Yes, a boy and a girl. -Funny kids. -Kids, you get them from the cradle, your customers? And when are they coming back, these two, for candles I mean? -I doubt they'll return. The last time, they were about to leave Paris with the fairground people. Oh, what fairground? That's asking a bit much. They went to Orleans, I think. Orleans? Fancy a game? Thank you, next time. You like that my darling, you're the best you know. I wish you'd talk to me like that. Oh, stop it Fredo, leave me alone. You've kissed the new kid, I saw you. Theo, that's something else. Something else? There, that'll do, good. Okay, turn around and let's see. Good. Now don't get it dirty before the performance. Okay? You can come in, Marie. Well I say, you look awfully nice like that. Your little sister's right. I'm not his little sister. Oh my mistake, who are you then? A friend, a good friend. Very well Miss good friend, how are we going to dress you? In a pot of glue. Theo, shall we take care of the horses? Me? I've never done that. I'll teach you, in the circus, you have to know how to do everything, come on. I know how to do everything. Then you'll have to do the programs in Latin. You're smart, but you'll see one day, I'll be a better dancer than Isabelle, and I won't purposely fall into the arms of boys. You look great, Theo. Yes, but the costume isn't enough to make an artist. I know, Isabelle's going to teach me to tap dance. You promised, eh? But of course, darling. "But of course, darling." What's up with him? He's jealous, you see. Jealous... of me? Of course silly, who do you think? -You're late. -I'm sorry. I was looking for information on Louis Valmore, Adeline's stepfather. He died during the fight for liberation. Didn't you know? He was a great resistance fighter. A loss for us. Poor Adeline. Adeline's great. She managed to let me know that the Nazis gather in a mansion. We were able to locate the place, look, it's here, where it's circled. What do you expect from me? We need to know what exactly is happening there, before intervening. And you're counting on me to...? Don't argue. You're here to help us fight these criminals. And then if they kill me, that only makes one Boche less. Is that it? Do you want to help Adeline Valmore, yes or no? Theo. Mom? Easy there, you should sleep. Why aren't you aleep? I was thinking about us, our future. -Our future? -Yes. Don't you think we should get married? -Married? It's not going to happen, you being the age you are. Not immediately, of course, when we're older. Now you almost double my age, it's true. But in 8 years, I'll be ¾ of your age and 5 years after I'd be an adult and free. I'll always be six years older than you. It's well known that men prefer younger women. It's still 13 years to wait, you realize? This is because of Isabelle, eh? What about Isabelle? Is it because of her that you don't want to? Because she has big boobs. But mine, you'll see later, they'll be pretty as any, while hers will have already begun to sag. It suits you. You can come on in, you know. No, no thank you. Say, I see over there, a young boy who looks like... a nephew that I've lost sight of since the liberation. Theo? Yes that's right, yes, I think it maybe him. -Wait, I'll go and fetch him. -Thank you. Theo, come quickly, your uncle's here looking for you. My uncle? But I've never had an uncle. Where is he? -Over there, behind the church. He was there, though. They've found us. -We must leave, immediately. -That suits you, eh? I don't see why it would suit me. Because you're jealous of Isabelle that's why. Take care, Theo. Goodbye little friend. You come back whenever you want, there'll always be a place for you here. I'll miss you, my darling. -Goodbye, my dear. -Goodbye. Thank you. I'm coming. Are you coming, Theo? You can count on me, Theo. I don't want to leave you. Neither do I. We'll soon see each other again. Don't worry, Marie, you'll be a great dancer later. See you, performer. Marie quickly, the bus is here. Quickly! Let me go! Stop, stop! No! Hello, yes. Marcelle, it's Charlie. Yes. I'll call you back. Hello. Sit down. Sit down. Some coffee? Oh... I forgot, We hold your son. But perhaps it'll help you recover your memory. A little milk? A sandwich? A cigarette? You can't hear anything, we must be in the countryside. I wonder how they knew we were going to take the bus. Who did you tell? To Isabelle of course. Shut up, she wouldn't betray us. It is obvious that you know nothing about women. Come here, you. Come on! You. Where are the documents? Where are they? I don't know what you mean, sir? We swear by the Virgin Mary? We lose nothing by waiting, eh? Theo, children, can you hear me? Climb up here, quickly. Give me your hand, come on. Okay, I've got you, Theo, come on, quickly. Come on. Careful. What happened between you and my mother? I've known your mother a long time, your father, too. My father too? Yes, before the war the 3 of us were in youth camp together. There were all nationalities. We fought for peace. And after? Later, when there was war, I was assigned to Dunkirk, I heard about the death of your father, and contacted your mother. So my mom and you...? Of course not, there was nothing between us, I swear. Now, we must save her, it's most urgent. Do you know where she is? Watch out, be quiet. Come on. Come quickly, both of you. Where are they? Are you kidding me? It's not possible. They couldn't tear off the grill by themselves, they were helped. Oh, you're the king of idiots. Come on! We must find them, they can't be far. I have my own ideas on that. Tell me... the... the documents that I gave to your mother, do you know where they are? I have them. They're at the Marchiano Circus. Marchiano Circus? They'll be in Poitiers tonight, I think. And the documents are under Isabelle's pillow I bet. Didy, where's Isabelle? -Gosh, are you back? -Isabelle? She's over there, putting on her makeup. Mario! Mario we're on in a moment. Isabelle? Theo, what are you doing here? It's you who informed them, right? It was you who told them we'd take the bus? What are you talking about? I swear I've never told anyone. So who told them we'd take the bus? Are you here again! It doesn't matter anymore. Give me the papers, I entrusted to you. You see they're quite safe. How could you doubt me? You know how much I love you. Everything will be fine, you're ready. How's Theo? He's fine. Adeline? It's better like this. It's better like this. Mom. Theo. Theo. Theo. Mom. I was so scared. Mom. So, are you my future mother in law? Bravo, bravo. We kept Marie with us, and I brought her up as my own daughter. She remained in love with Theo, and it's their marriage that eventually erased the memory... of the events we'd all been through. Subtitles by Oliver Sanderson
