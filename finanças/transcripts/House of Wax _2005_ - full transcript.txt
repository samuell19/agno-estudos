His parents won't let him. - Who says I want to get married? Besides, I've been late before. When I know for sure, I promise to talk to him, okay? Let's go. (rock music) (light chattering) - [Carly] There are ticks out here. - [Dalton] Yeah, don't help us or nothing. - Let's set up. - Aw, yeah! - Pass! Pass! - Here we go. - You don't want to... Too slow!

Please? - Bye, Wade. - Asshole. - You know what? You can be a prick to me, that's fine, but he didn't do anything to you. - Hmm. So you admit that you did something. - I admit according to you I did something. Sure. - You dimed me out. - I did not dime you out. When the sheriffs came to the house and asked me where you got the car, I said I didn't know. I didn't even know it was stolen. And you're blaming that on me? - You could have covered for me, huh? - You get caught for stealing a car and it's my fault. You're resisting arrest and it's the cop's fault. - (chuckles) Well, he took a swing at me, you know? - Look, get kicked off the football team, it's the coach's fault. Mom and Dad kick you out of the house, it's their fault. You can't even keep a job for more than two weeks, 'cause it's every manager's fault. - I'm surrounded by idiots. - So why did you come, to piss me off? (Nick snickers) - Don't you get it? You're the good twin. I'm the evil one. (groans) - Grow up. You are so afraid to take things seriously. - Oh. Yeah. As afraid as Wade is of leaving good ol' Gainesville? Huh? New York City.

What are you doing? - Getting you back to bed. Come on. Let's go to sleep. - I heard something. - Get in that tent. (Carly giggles) - Ah, damn it. Hey, it's 2:30! Get up! Let's go, guys. Get up. Get up! Wade, Dalton, let's go. (clapping) We're gonna miss the damn game. Nick! Get up! (sighs) Damn. - Dude, you see my camera anywhere? - Nah, man. - You guys seen my camera anywhere? - [Nick] Like I give a shit about your camera. (Carly chuckles) - So, you and Wade talk some more? - We're just in different places right now. And he hasn't given me a guilt trip for going, so I can't give him one for staying. Ugh! (ominous music) - Oh, my God, there's that smell again. - I think it's coming from over there. (grunts) - Yeah, let's go follow the smell. (scoffs) - What? I want to see what it is. - Why? - [Carly] Come on! (engine sputtering) - What the hell was that? (Dalton sighs) No way. Are you serious? It was brand-new. (Nick chuckles) Someone's fucking with me. - I cannot believe you're making me do this. (chuckles) Only you. - Come on. It'll be fine. - I'm gonna throw up.

Where are you? - Hang on, baby! - All right, right here. Carly! Hold on. I'm here. - Ah, man. - Here. Grab me, baby. Come on. Come on. I got you. Get up. Oh. You all right? Oh, man. - [Blake] There's a roadkill pit down here. - You all right? - I fell in. - Oh, yeah. That smells about right. - Baby, you okay? - Uh-huh. - Come on, I got you. (Carly panting) It's okay. (Carly panting) - [Blake] Hey, is that the truck from last night? - Not unless he fixed his headlight. (engine rumbling) (tools clattering) (fly buzzing) - [Wade] Hey! - Don't you see that? What is that? (eerie music) - No way. What are you doing, man? - Anyone need a hand? (laughing) I'm just foolin'. It's not real, see? (finger tapping) - [Carly] (sighing) God. - I found it on the side of the road a few weeks ago. - Oh, my God, are you okay? - Sorry we took so long. - It's all right. - What are you guys doing 'round here? - We were all camping up through those trees. - I have water in here somewhere. God. - Oh, good. - Hey, you guys seen my camera, by any chance? - Are you kidding? - No. - Damn. - Hey, you don't know if there's a gas station around here, do you? - Well, I got some gas in the truck, if- - I need a fan belt. - What? - Just busted. - Of course. Perfect. - Bo might have one. Runs a station in Ambrose. - Where's that? - 15 miles up the road. - Let's just get one in Baton Rouge. We'll put it on when we get back. - Man, there's no way I'm leaving my car. What if that guy from last night comes and strips it or something? - Well, whatever, man. You're gonna miss the game, then. - Yeah, well, that's not why I came. - All right, then, look. I'll run you up to the station, but let's go now. Kickoff's in a couple hours. - Dude, you're already late. You still gotta find a scalper and snag tickets. Y'all should just go now. I'll stay with my car. It's fine. Just go and get me a fan belt on the way back. And make sure it's a 15-inch. Gotcha. - I'll give you a ride. - You serious? - If you like. - Well, yeah. - That's cool? - Yeah, if it's cool. - I'm going with you. - No, no, no. - Carly, no. - Yes. It'll be fine. - All right, let's go. Come on, Paige. - Carly. - What? - [Blake] Hey, I'll get you guys tickets and leave them at will call. - Thank you. - All right. All good, man. - [Blake] Come on, babe. (tense music) (man chuckles) - No, it's okay. (Carly pants) - Come on, babe. So let's get out of here. (Dalton exhales) - Man, you're just gonna let them leave like that? With a guy who throws roadkill in a pit for a living? - You clean shit for a living, Mr. Septic Tank Man. What's the difference? - Well, I don't walk through it, that's one. That's a difference, right? Yup. (chuckles) (ominous music) (engine humming) (tools clattering) (man snickers) - Can you roll the window down, please? - [Wade] Yeah. - Sorry 'bout that. (chuckling) Truck's seen better days. - Do you mind rolling down your window, then? - Not at all. (handle squeaking) Sorry. I kinda get used to the smell. - Really? I don't think I could ever get used to it. - Well, you can get used to anything, if you're around it long enough. Oh, if you get 'em in the early morning before the sun bakes 'em up, they're not so bad. If they're fresh, though, I just take 'em home. Why waste the meat? (Carly sighs) - Are we almost there yet? - It's just up the road. Yep, Ambrose used to be a pretty nice town before the interstate came in. You like knives! - Not really. - Tools of the trade. You want to see it? - That's okay. - It's a bowie. It's a good knife. That'll cut through anything. (dramatic music) (tires squealing) - Oh, shit. Hey, what's going on, man? You said there was a town up here. - Well, yeah, there is. It's just around that bend. I gotta flip my hubs into four-wheel. You mind giving me a hand? - When's the last time that you were here? - (chuckles) Well, you don't believe me? I forgot this way in's washed out, that's all. - We'll walk the rest of the way, then. Thank you. You've done enough. - Now, why would you want to do that? - Look, we want to walk, okay? Just let us out now. - Sure. (eerie music) (music intensifying) Well, get out, then! Try and do something nice for someone. - Look, man, it's not like that, all right? We appreciate it. - (laughing) Yeah, I can tell. - Is he still staring? - Yeah. Just keep walking. - Oh, like I'm gonna stop. - Damn... Now I feel like a real asshole. - I don't care. That guy was a freak. - Yeah. (ominous music) (horns honking) - Dude, it's over. - It'll move. (rock song plays low on stereo) (Blake sighs) - It's not moving. - Look, we'll make it for the second half. - Okay, dude, I'm not sitting in this traffic. - Well, then what do you want me to do? - Come on, man. Let's just go to Carly and Wade- - We have to go back come on. - Turn around. - I'm not missing the best game of the year. - Turn the car around. Okay? - Come on, they're waiting for us already. (horn honks) - Slow down, speedy. God! (Carly laughs) Miss Ambrose. Wonder how many teeth you have to have to win that one. (Carly chuckles) This is kind of nice. - Yeah. Oh, wait, babe, there's a pet store. - Oh, great. - Come on. (Carly gasps) - Are those puppies? Oh, my God! Look at them! - [Wade] They're cute, adorable. Maybe next time. Come on. - Oh, my God. - Come on. (rock music playing softly) - Hello? (Carly sighs) (bell jangling) - [Wade] Hello? (bluesy rock music plays in distance) You see anybody? - No, nobody. (cell phone rings) - Oh. Hello? - Hey, it's me. We're heading back. - Really, why? What happened? - [Paige] Traffic. Did you get that fan belt thing or whatever? - (sighs) No. There's no one at the gas station. I don't know where we're going right now. - [Paige] So, where do you want us to pick you up? - Why don't you just head up the road that we got off at for the campsite? It's washed out at the end. Call us when you get there. We'll meet you. (newscast plays low in background) - [Paige] We'll camp in the same place as yesterday, but, you know, away from that pet cemetery. - (chuckles) Cool. See you then. - Hey. There's that House of Wax. - Wade, what about the fan belt? - Well, there's no one at the station. - Why don't we ask someone in the church? - All right. All right. (pipe organ music) (dog barking in distance) - [Priest] Let us all bow our heads and say a prayer for our beloved deceased friend. (mourner sobbing) - Oh... We should go. - Yeah. (door creaking) (Wade coughs) - What do we do? Just wait out here? - I don't know. I feel kind of messed up waiting outside a church for a funeral to end. Hey, man, sorry about walking in. We didn't know- - You shouldn't have walked in. - Yeah, I know, it's just that we have car trouble and we're not from this town. - We were actually looking for a guy named Bo. He works at the gas station. - [Bo] You found him. - Really? Well (clears throat), we need a fan belt. We were camping up the road and- - A fan belt? - Yeah. - You walk in on a funeral for a fucking fan belt? Well, let me just go dump the casket in the ground. I'll be right there. - Look, we're sorry. - Yeah. (door creaks) - That's twice today. I'm an asshole. Let's just go back to the road. - Hey. Hey, I'm sorry. You know, someone very special to me passed, and I didn't mean to take it out on you. - No, no, no, no. It's totally understandable. - I reckon things will wrap up soon. Why don't I meet you guys back at the station in about a half? - That'd be great, if that's okay. - Yeah. Great. What? - Nothing. Looks like your fan club's gotten a little bigger. - Are you serious? - Yeah. I am serious. And it's obvious Dalton still has a crush on you, too. - Oh, my God. Okay, that's three times today. You're an asshole. Let's go see your famous House of Wax. - [Wade] But I'm still your favorite asshole, right? - [Carly] Always. (laughs) (woman singing in foreign language) (classical opera music) I don't know what you expect to see in here. (Wade chuckles) - It is wax. Like, literally. - Huh. (door thuds) - You're not gonna go in there, are you? - Yeah. (woman singing in foreign language) (door thudding) - [Carly] Doesn't closed mean I don't want you in here? - [Wade] Relax, I just want to take a quick look. - [Carly] What if someone's here? - [Wade] Hello? Anyone in here? See? We're fine. Wow. How cool is this? Everything in here is wax: the floor, the walls. Look at this. This is wax. - [Carly Yeah, cool. Awesome. - [Wade] Who are these people supposed to be? - I don't know. - Aren't there supposed to be famous people in a wax museum? I don't recognize this guy. (chuckles) - "Trudy opens House of Wax." "Trudy's wax carvings are a hit at the State Fair."” "Trudy and husband are expecting first child.” Since when is a wax sculptor a celebrity? - I don't know. Small town, I guess. - That's right. You like small towns. - I didn't say I wasn't gonna like New York. I just said I haven't made a decision yet. I still have time, all right? - Mm-hmm. Well, I'd really like you to be there with me. - Oh, no! There's a fire. Help me, Carly. I'm melting. My skirt's gonna catch on fire. My legs are all burned. - Cut it out, please. - You're my hero. - [Carly] That's not cool. - Hey, Car. There's a dog for you. Hey, puppy. You a little wax dog, too? What up, dawg? (dog growling) Jesus! (Carly laughs) - That is cool. - What the? Yeah, ha-ha, laugh it up. What's a dog doing in here anyway? (striking keys) (light piano music) - Vincent? Another Vincent. (eerie music) This Vincent guy's quite the artist. - Yeah, I think this Vincent guy needs therapy. I mean, look how detailed this is. Tell me this doesn't look real. - I don't really care. I mean, not that it's bad, but everything made out of wax, don't you think that's a little weird? - Those aren't wax. - Oh, whatever. Hey, when do you think the last person was here? A while, probably. (dramatic music) (Carly gasps) What? What is it? - I just saw someone. - It was probably just a wax thing. - No, no. It wasn't a wax thing. It was moving and it was freaky-looking. - I'll go check it out. - Wade, where are you going? Don't leave me. Wade, come on. - Hang here a second. - No. Wait. (door thudding) (low ominous music) (door rattling) (floor creaking) (distant thudding) (dramatic music) (Carly gasps) (Carly screams) (intense music) - Whoa! Hey! Damn, Carly, what's wrong? - This place is freaking me out. - Hey, calm down. There's no one out here. - Please, I just want to go. - Okay, okay. We'll go to the station then. - [Dalton] Ah, dude, I had to pee so bad, man. (Dalton moaning) Come on, dude! - Hey, are you guys gonna have sex? - What? - 'Cause me and Paige are. - So you two go pick them up. - Yeah, all right. - Hey, Paige. - Yeah? - Nick and Dalton are gonna go get them. - Why? We can go. - Oh, baby! Come on. I'm tired of driving. - Okay. - Why don't you let my man drive? - Really? Ah, you heard him. Move. - Give me the damn keys. - Okay, okay, okay. Very slow. Thank you. - I still don't think this is cool, just coming in here like this. - What? Look, the door was unlocked. He said he was gonna be half an hour. He's been, like, 45 minutes. I'm sure he won't mind. You know, if your brother and his yes-man hadn't come along in the first place, we all would have fit with Blake and none of this would have happened. - Once again, that's not my fault. - I mean, I don't understand his beef with me. I've always tried to be cool with him. - Nick's got beef with everybody. You just can't take it personally. - Yeah, I guess. - Nick and I always used to stick together, and then, when we were in junior high, Nick would get into a little trouble here and there and our parents would always, like, compare us. I was the good twin, and Nick was the evil twin, as he likes to say. He kind of got this image. He totally played it up as if that's what he had to be or something. (sighs) It's already getting dark. I hate the winter. - He's got everything but a 15-inch. Just have to use a 16-inch. Make it work somehow. - You plan on stealing that? - No. We just didn't know how much longer you were gonna be, and, you know, we didn't want to interrupt again. But I left you some money on the counter, but you don't even really have the right size. You don't have any 15-inches. - I do at the house. - Look, I hope you're not getting the wrong idea that we're in here. - No, it's okay. - Does that cover it? - It's close enough. Look, why don't we head up to the house and get the one you need? You know, it's only a couple blocks. - Yeah, all right. - You keep fan belts at your house? - Well, I get things delivered there when I'm not here. Now, look, if you want to hold onto the 16, that's fine by me. - No, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay. - Hey, you mind if I use your restroom real fast? - Oh, up at the house. That one's out of order. - All right. So is it too late to sign Carly up for that beauty pageant? Now, unfortunately, it is, 'cause you would have won hands down. - (chuckles) Thank you. - [Wade] So, that House of Wax was pretty cool. - You went inside? - Yeah. - Yeah, it was unlocked, so, you know. - Everything seems to be unlocked around you, now don't it? Yeah, people used to come to see it from miles away. And Trudy was the main, I guess artist is the appropriate word. - What about Vincent? I saw his name on a lot of the work. - One of Trudy's boys. - They still around? - No, no. It's a horrible story. Trudy's husband, Doc Sinclair, he was a doctor in the big city until he got his license revoked for doing surgeries on the side, you know, stuff that, you know, most doctors wouldn't dare do. So, he moved him and Trudy out here to Ambrose, made a fresh start with his medical practice and, you know, Trudy really found her calling with that whole wax sculpture thing. It was her dream to do something really incredible here. Then she had a couple kids, picket fence... - What's so horrible about that? - Yeah? - Trudy got a cyst in her brain. She just started rotting away. Couldn't work no more, and she went crazy. Things got so bad that Doc Sinclair finally had to strap her to the bed. I mean, the whole town could hear her screaming from the house. Dr. Sinclair was so depressed that he couldn't save her, he (mimics gun firing) blew his head right off. - That's terrible. - It was worse for the two boys, left all alone like that. Both ended up in foster homes. - Hey, why don't you two hop in? I'll go get the fan belt, and I'll give you a ride back to your car. - No, actually, we got some friends picking us up where the road's washed out. - I'll give you a lift there, then. It's the least I could do for making y'all wait. - Cool. - All right. - Hey, you need, you said you need to use the facilities, right? - Yeah. Thanks. - Need to use the can? - No, that's okay. I'm fine. All right. So, where you heading to, anyway? - Oh, we're just going to a football game. - Hey, the bathroom is right down the hall. Let me get out of this jacket and tie and I'll grab the fan belt. - Okay. Thanks. (ominous music) (engine humming) - Just let me drive, bitch. He gave me the keys, man. - Yeah, 'cause he thinks I'm the one who stole the car and crashed it. - Whatever, man. You didn't have to cover for me, dude. - Hey, your jacket's clean, all right? Mine's already got plenty of stains on it. One more's not gonna make a difference. Where the hell is this place? Town's not even on the GPS. - That's weird. (toilet flushing) (door creaking) (soft ominous music) (Wade squeaks) (Wade chuckles) (Carly sighs deeply) (keys jingling) (radio music) (Carly sighs) (soft ominous music) (machine whirring) (tool rattling) (tense music) (music intensifying) (dramatic music) (horn honking) (eerie music) (ominous music) (object rattling) (knocking on door) - Hello? (switch clicking) Hello? (door rattling) (knocking on door) Hello? (knocking on door) I'm in here! (intense music) Hello? I'm in here! (knocking on door) (door rattling) (knocking on door) Hey! (door rattling) Hello? (pounding on door) Hello! (skin tearing) (Wade screaming) (intense music) (Wade whimpering) (Wade gasping) (intense music) (scissors whooshing) (Wade screaming) (horn honking) (music intensifying) (foot thudding) (keypad beeping) (line ringing) - Come on. (phone ringing) (rap music playing on radio) (Paige gasps) - [Blake] Hey, it's Blake. You know what to do. (machine beeps) - Guys, where the hell are you? Listen, remember the truck that came to the campsite last night? I think we just ran into him. (tense music) Where's Wade? - Oh, he's not out here? Guess he's still in the bathroom, then. I got the fan belt. You're not in a hurry, are you?
