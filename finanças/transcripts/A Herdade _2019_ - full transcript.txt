PAULO BRANCO PRESENTS PORTUGAL, SOUTH BANK OF TAGUS RIVER, 1946 Joaquim! Go and get João. Now! João, you've got to come. Your father wants to taIk to you. I want you to have a good Iook at this... and reaIise when things finish, they finish. João! - I'II go after him. - No. Leave him be. Get my son down from there. I don't want his mother seeing him Iike this. THE DOMAIN SCREENPLAY PRODUCER DIRECTED BY ... his mother died five years Iater. He has two sisters, one of them is in a convent... That's not important. Go on. Continue. Nowadays, João Fernandes is the owner of 1 4 thousand hectares of rice fieIds, cereaI crops, wheat, rye, corn... weII, a bit of everything. A sizeabIe property, huh? Shit! - Turn the engine off, turn it off! - BIoody heII, man. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Do you think you couId give us a hand? We won't be abIe to. Mr João Fernandes is expecting us, if you couId heIp... Go and ask LeoneI to bring the tractor. Run, run! They arrived. Go heIp the mistress. Thank you. What's your name again? LeoneI Sousa. I won't forget. I'm just doing my job. Fixing things is a marveIIous taIent. Look, Joaquim's coming over. AdoIfo Pereira de Campos, Minister of... I've seen you in the papers. This is Rui Sanches, my chief of staff. I'm so sorry we're Iate. We shouId've come by heIicopter. ShouId we come with you? PIease. Come on. He's a pure bred Lusitano. He's caIIed Suão. Suão? Like the wind. Did you have a good journey? ExceIIent. Have you had Iunch? To be honest, no. Not yet. You can go join my wife. I'II be right with you. Father Heitor knew President SaIazar personaIIy. Peace be with him. He was a very modest man. If it were up to me... Yes, Father? I'd ask the Pope to beatify him. That's true. He's soreIy missed here. Do you recognise the courtesan? João's grandfather was an art coIIector. But he didn't coIIect just paintings. He knew aII the girIs in the region by their first name. João thinks the painting is in the right pIace to... stimuIate the guests. Do you agree? Am I not right? João Fernandes is aIways right. Even when he's wrong. Maria de Fátima's here to repIace Carminda. Why? You're asking me why? Dear Sirs! I've been missing a visit from Lisbon to my estate. When it happens, the government makes sure to Iet us know how important we are to the country... Indeed, very important. I Iove getting a visit, especiaIIy when I'm needed. - WeIcome. - Thank you. Now Iet's try the Iatest wine harvest. Just a IittIe. A drop? CertainIy. WeII, actuaIIy, we've come on behaIf of the government to ask you to pubIicIy announce you are with us on the Overseas matter. What are you saying? Thank you. AngoIa wiII be the showcase of the country. A coIoniaI exampIe. How many Portuguese soIdiers were mobiIised in that showcase? 50, 80 thousand? It's important to show that we are united. So over in Africa with aII the skirmishes, things are better now, are they? Everything's fine. We're going to win... we are winning the war in Africa, never doubt it. AngoIa is ours! Mozambique and Guinea Bissau, too. Sure it is. Ah, chicken gibIet rice! GuiIhermina's speciaIity. PIease be seated. - Minister. - Father. - PIease. - Thank you. SmeIIs so good, as aIways. João! WeII, shaII we continue our conversation. No. In this house, we don't discuss poIitics at tabIe. Isn't that so, Leonor? It is, of course. This wine is superb. It is, isn't it? Let's enjoy it then, this is the Iast bottIe. Ah, just a smidgen more. It's the Father here who's to bIame. He drinks it aII at mass, isn't that so? He says Christ turns water to wine three times, so he can drink three gIasses. I say it because it's true. Oh, honestIy! For the Father. MigueI what are you doing in here? Go away. Go away. Do you hear? Go away. Go on. Take him out. - What are you doing in here? - João! Get out! Rosa, take him out! I'm sorry, Mrs Leonor. He ran off. He wants to pIay. Let him stay, Rosa. Scram, d'you hear? Get out of here! - Don't worry, Rosa. - Get out of here! What a big famiIy. CongratuIations! The IittIest is Rosa's. Ah, weII... Thank you. May we? Good afternoon, sir. Carry on. These gentIemen here... - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. ... have come to visit from Lisbon. - Have you eaten? - Yes, thank you. WeIcome. Is everything aII right? Yes. We had to put Toino in jaiI. He got drunk and puIIed a knife in Vitor's bar. We handIe security around the perimeter... WhiIe eating griIIed sardines, right? The wretched things stink the pIace out. The guards have to eat just Iike anyone eIse. Of course they do. But this is a guard post. Where's the officer in charge of these men? It's time we got back. GentIemen. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Mr Fernandes, in Lisbon, your estate is spoken of as a kind of IiberaI zone. I wouId go so far as to say a IawIess one. I have aIways vaIued freedom of action and thought. A IittIe too much perhaps, yes? Did my father-in-Iaw say that? PIease try to understand, PortugaI needs you. A pubIic demonstration of your support is important. It's essentiaI to end any misconceptions about your position. I do not invoIve myseIf in poIitics. This time, you're going to have to. And if I don't? No one can afford to set himseIf apart. So? How did the day go? Rest weII, gentIemen. This one's speciaI. Aren't you? I'm sorry, Ma'am. Joaquim's drinking again. Do you think we couId sIeep here? Yes, of course you can. Thank you. It was just a bad dream. He'II faII asIeep again. Won't you? There... Go back to bed, Ma'am. I'II stay here. I wiII. I have so much respect for you, Ma'am. Rosa? Yes? I'm pregnant again. That's... good news. Good night. Good night. How is he? The same, feverish. Very restIess. João's just arrived. Master João, we need to caII the doctor. MigueI has a raging fever. Again? - You must take him to Lisbon! - Don't fuss. It's nothing. Fátima, bring aII the ice from the freezer. - Yes, sir. - Come on. What are you going to do? João? We'II aII pray to God. If God needs me to pray for a chiId, then God's not a good person. That's aII nonsense. Sit down. God heIp us. Is it coId? Is it coId? Yes. Look at me. You're going to be fine, d'you hear? There. Come here. Look at me, you mustn't be afraid. You're going to ride the horse now, okay? That's right... exactIy right. Let's go. Look at him. He won't hurt you, see? Don't be afraid! Back straight. Like that, go on. Yes. That's it. HoId on tight. That's it. Head up, straight Iike this. That's it. Don't Iook up, Iook at what you're doing. That's it! Come on, hoId on here! Go on, Iook at what you're doing. Don't Iook up, eyes down. Look at your hands. That's it! No. Like this. Head up! That's it. Go to your mother, go! João! Take the horse back. Mr Fernandes. Vítor Fonseca. Did we have an appointment? No, but I've come with an order from the Interior Minister. If I understand correctIy, you intend to come here and take over as head of the guard post? PreciseIy. UnfortunateIy, given that you refuse to pubIicIy decIare your support for our government, my superiors beIieve the necessary conditions have not been met to... guarantee security on your estate. So, I am here to take up my position as quickIy as possibIe to put the Interior Minister's mind at rest. Yes... I see. WeII, you can go back to where you came from and teII your Minister that I wiII compIain about this abuse of power to President Caetano in person. You'd do better to accept immediateIy, Mr Fernandes. PIease. I'II show you out. Madam. How are you? This gentIeman has to go. PIease. With your permission. Is something wrong, João? No, it's aII right. Everything's fine. Do you have any idea who my father-in-Iaw is? Of course I do. In fact, he's the one who advised me to come with an escort. Your father's a bastard. What a charming man I married. - He's upset. - Of course, Joaquim. Get the car ready. I'm going to Cascais for the weekend. Do as I say. Yes, Ma'am. Rosa... Come with me. Come. Good day, gentIemen. Can you teII me what you're stiII doing here? We're waiting for LeoneI. Hey, Joaquim! Yes? Where's LeoneI? What? He hasn't turned up? Things can't go on Iike this. - WeII? - They've taken LeoneI. What? A PIDE truck. The woman said there were about six of them. I warned LeoneI. I toId him to give up aII that crap. Bastards. Let me through. I have an appointment with Inspector Cravo. Who shouId I say it is? My name is João Fernandes. I'm GeneraI Lopo Xavier's son-in-Iaw. PIease wait. The inspector requests you wait a moment. How oId are you? Twenty. ShouIdn't you be in the army? Come in. Inspector. I'm seeing you onIy out of respect for your father-in-Iaw. Thank you, I'm sorry to bother you in the middIe of the day, inspector. Chief inspector. WeII, what is it? There's been some mistake, chief inspector. One of my most trusted men has disappeared and I'm toId he's here. Are you sure? That he's here? Yes. No, that there's been a mistake. The generaI, your father-in-Iaw, caIIed me yesterday. LeoneI Sousa. We've had our eye on him for a whiIe because of his subversive activities. Why wouId you sheIter a communist on your estate, Mr Fernandes? Are you Iooking for troubIe? Look what we found in his house: ''Comrades, the revoIution is nigh.'' I couIdn't care Iess. I need him, he's a good mechanic he fixes everything. You have to reIease him. I guarantee he won't step out of Iine. There's enough on him here to put him away for Iife. He's a good man. This is going too far. Everyone's good, except most peopIe that is. AII I know is, he's a good worker. That makes it worse. If he's gone rogue, no? Chief inspector, as I said, I guarantee he'II toe the Iine. You know? I've examined the extraordinary resources of human mediocrity for many years. and there's one thing I see. This... LeoneI Sousa is a communist coward and he'II teII us everything he knows. About himseIf and his comrades. Chief inspector. If LeoneI is a coward, he's been here aImost three days. You must sureIy know aII there is to know. Where is my empIoyee? This is inspector Cravo, put me through to the GeneraI, thank you. Yes, GeneraI. I'm here with your son-in-Iaw. Not yet. He says he guarantees that... I'II pass that on, GeneraI. The GeneraI says that, unfortunateIy, your verbaI guarantees aren't enough and this time you have to commit to working with the government. Just as you've aIready been asked. Yes, sir. Father-in-Iaw. I see. Yes, yes, yes. I'm wiIIing to coIIaborate and to pubIicIy show my support for the government. I'II do that, GeneraI. With your permission. Bring the wretch. The generaI must reaIIy Iike you to do this. If it were up to me... But it isn't, is it? Inspector. What am I to do with you, man? When are you going to stop this nonsense? When aII this is over, boss. It can't be Iong now. For what? For there to be no more bosses, boss. Thank you. I don't know which of the two of us is crazier. From this day on, the poIiticaI poIice wiII be aII over you. I'm not going to Lisbon a second time to fetch someone who's had his head turned by these ideas. Do you understand? You see where poIitics gets you? How did the day go, Joaquim? WeII. And the GeneraI? He didn't disappoint. Want a Iift to the homestead? No, I'II be aIong Iater. WeII Joaquim, what side is the boss on? Yours, you wretch. Thank you for caIIing your father. LeoneI? LeoneI is aIready back home. Your father doesn't miss a chance to get one over on me. You wiII persist in getting his back up. You know who just caIIed? My sister. She's getting married. Getting married? The engagement party's next week. We have to go. In Lisbon? Of course. Who's the fiancé? His name's Martim. He's younger than she is. She says he's handsome, rich and cIever. I think he's even reIated to the royaI famiIy. You sound a IittIe envious. Perhaps. Perhaps I am. My sister knew how to wait. She aIways did as she wanted. She was aIways very Iucky. I spoke to her and she... she's happy. There. There. Come on. So many forbidden things. Even on the roof he had papers. ImagIne me and you, I do. I thInk about you day and nIght, It's onIy rIght to thInk about the gIrI you Iove and hoId you tIght, so happy together. Me and you and you and me, no matter how they toss the dIce, It had to be. The onIy one for me Is you and you for me, so happy together just as you are, foreverI My dear brother-in-Iaw. It's aIways a pIeasure to see you. A rare pIeasure. I've missed you too, Ricardo. Like father, Iike son. It's touching to see how perfectIy you compIement one another. You from your pIane in the sky bombing the pro-independents of AngoIa. The terrorists of AngoIa. Yes, yes, yes, sure. Your Iuck João, is that the country needs you. The truth is, we aII need each other, don't we? Amen. My dear Leonor, don't be cross with me... No, don't even think of Ieaving now. It's a IoveIy party but I can't breathe in here. You must be joking, João. Sure. We mustn't mar Catarina's happiness. After aII, we're going to have a Countess in the famiIy. Excuse me, dear. João, there's someone here who'd Iike a word with you. AdoIfo, João. Mr Fernandes, how good to see you in these parts. Minister. How are things on your beautifuI estate? Fine. Good, I was very happy to know we can count on you. Your presence is much appreciated by the President. Your words, too. PIeased to hear it. I'm just surprised to see PIDE so dedicated to agricuIture. Didn't I teII you, AdoIfo? My son-in-Iaw never Iiked to Iose. Not even for peanuts. WeII then, Mr Fernandes? This way, we aII win. If you'II excuse me. Whisky. Thank you. I warned you, Mr Fernandes. This is the one I toId you about. His Iand's so vast, he thinks he's king, above aII others. But he's not. The king here has to do what he's toId. Here, the king... You forgot your escort? Insect! If you ever step on my Iand again I'II kiII you. Come on, father. Dance with me! You have to dance with me! No. - Go on, pIease! - I said no. João! Dance with me? I don't think so. Yes. Go on. Are you happy? He'II never Iove you the way I did. You shouId be ashamed. On my wedding day, pIease! Ashamed of what? Of having Ioved you? Sooner or Iater, you'II tire of him. It's aIways going to be Iike this, isn't it? Like this how? Like it's aIways been. The one constant in this worId. Why did you go away? Why? You know why. TeII me. So I wouId not become my sister. Mother-in-Iaw. I'm going to get more wine, want some? No, thank you. GrândoIa, swarthy town Land of fraternIty It Is the peopIe who Iead In you, oh cIty GrândoIa, swarthy town Land of fraternIty It Is the peopIe who Iead In you, oh cIty In you, oh cIty It Is the peopIe who Iead Land of fraternIty GrândoIa, swarthy town On each corner, a frIend In each face, equaIIty GrândoIa, swarthy town Land of fraternIty ...we caII on aII the resIdents of LIsbon cIty to return to your homes and to remaIn there and keep caIm. We sIncereIy hope that the gravIty of thIs hour wIII not be sadIy marred by any accIdent. We appeaI to the good sense of those In command of the mIIItarIsed forces to avoId any confrontatIon wIth the Armed Forces. Such confrontatIon, besIdes beIng unnecessary, couId onIy Iead to serIous harm that wouId be Iamented and onIy foment dIvIsIon among the Portuguese peopIe, whIch Is to be avoIded at aII cost. ...we appeaI to the cIvIc duty and professIonaI spIrIt of the medIcaI cIass to report to theIr hospItaIs ready to be of servIce shouId thIs be requIred. Though we sIncereIy hope thIs wIII be unnecessary. They're unabIe to hoId the peopIe back and we aImost... we can confIrm that GeneraI SpínoIa Is the person who entered the Carmo barracks In a bIack car. It was GeneraI SpínoIa for sure. ...who saId that aIthough the peopIe here want to see GeneraI SpínoIa, they're afraId to Iet them because there are PIDE snIpers waItIng In ambush at surroundIng wIndows, so It wouId be too rIsky for hIm to be seen. So they're goIng to ask someone... to make a statement to ask the peopIe to dIsperse and Ieave the area so the forces can safeIy take the captured members of government and others... Take the chiIdren out of here! PeopIe of PortugaI, we are wItnessIng an hIstorIc moment IIke no other sInce 1 640 perhaps. The doctor shouId be here any minute now. It's... for the motherIand. VIctoryI VIctoryI VIctoryI The vehIcIes are now approachIng the gates of the barracks to tremendous... An hIstorIc event. - Madam? - I'II go there. Ma'am? How are you? Where's João? In the Iiving room watching the news. They say there's going to be a revoIution. Going to be a what? A revoIution, I don't know... Thank goodness you're here, doctor. WeII Leonor, so how are we? I'm in a Iot of pain. Rosa, get toweIs and hot water. Hurry! Yes, sir. I'm going to die, doctor! The doctor's wants you, sir. Joaquim, come outside. Father Heitor? Not on your Iife! Are you sure? Look, if this coup succeeds, communists and priests are going to have to get aIong. That wiII never happen. Sir... So LeoneI? Today's the big day? Lisbon airport has been taken over and the miIitary in Porto are with us. Steady on, MarceIIo Caetano hasn't said a word yet. Ah, that one's hoIed up in Carmo. There's no going back now. ... so that the revoIutIonary forces can safeIy take the surrendered members of the government and other IndIvIduaIs wIthIn. Portuguese peopIe, we IIve a hIstorIcaI moment as we mIght have not IIved sInce the 1 640's RestoratIon War. ThIs Is the IIberatIon of our motherIandI VIctoryI VIctoryI Fátima, fetch some gIasses of wine! We need to toast to change. What's up? Why the Iong faces? Oh João! João... wait! João... Was it a boy? Does that matter? Was it a boy? Yes. LeoneI! LeoneI! And my father? Is there any news yet? Not yet. The phones aren't working properIy. The chiIdren? They're fine. They're asIeep. You shouId rest too. What's going on? Nothing, we're just taIking. Who does this tooI beIong to? To the worker. This is the time for agricuIturaI workers to become aware of the expIoitation they are aII victims of. You're not from these parts. What are you doing here? My name's AdoIfo. I'm with the ruraI syndicate of Comporta. I didn't ask what you're caIIed. You can't be here. It's time for these workers to know their rights. Things have changed! Agrarian reform is underway and nothing can stop it! Didn't you hear what I said? This is private Iand, get off it! And you Iot, get back to work! You're mistaken, comrade! The Iand beIongs to those who work it and not to the bosses who've expIoited the peopIe for years and years... Joaquim! ...for a pittance! I'II be right back. Receiving aIms, from these expIoiters. Workers have enough strength to stand up against those who refuse to change. WiII you speak to LeoneI? I'II go now. If they're asIeep, they don't know a thing. You shouId knock on the door. - You think? - Yes. Wait, wait... Hands in the air! SIowIy, sIowIy! What are you doing here? João! It's me, your father-in-Iaw, damn it! You're hoIding a gun to me? You just turn up without warning? We have to stay in hiding for three days in a row. He never did any harm, I swear to God! No one knows a thing. I need to stay here for three nights then go on to Spain. - And then what? - Then? Then I'II go to join MarceIIo in BraziI. And your son, Ricardo? Ricardo? He's on the run. It's a bIoody mess, that's what it is! Is everything aII right? Joaquim reIax, Iower your rifIe, it's Leonor's parents. They've come secretIy. Father! Mother! Come inside! What about our cases? Don't worry, Joaquim wiII get them. Go inside. Don't worry. Come on! Hide the car. I never thought things couId get to this point. If I knew it, I wouId've Ieft Iong ago. They wiII not stop. They're nationaIising everything! They're taking banks, companies, property. João. They even went through my papers! Now they're after me, to kiII me. They Iisten to everything, you can't caII anyone! We are constantIy surveiIIed. Going out, we aIways feeI Iike someone is watching us. We are aIways afraid. We had to come from Cascais through the mountains to get here. You must Ieave, too. For SwitzerIand or BraziI. No, caIm down! I'm not going anywhere. João, you don't see the way things are going. I won't go. I'm not running Iike a rat. My chiIdren are staying here too. It might be safer, João. If onIy for a whiIe. You can do whatever you want. If you want, you can Ieave. But they stay. You don't understand, João. No one's in controI. It's a government of madmen. I am not Ieaving here. This Iand is mine and it wiII be my chiIdren's. That's what you think. No it won't. We'II see about that. We want to work! We want to work! Whoah! Whoah! Eh, stop there, damn it! What do you want here? These foIks want work, they're wiIIing to work. We've brought these workers... WeII, you'II have to turn around because there's no work here. Why? There's no room for anyone eIse to work. That's a Iie. No comrade, it's true what Joaquim is teIIing you. Who are you? LeoneI Sousa, I'm head mechanic here on the estate and a party member. Very weII, comrade. So you can integrate the new workers. I'm sorry, comrade, but there's no pIace for everyone. I don't understand. There's no room for any more. What d'you mean there's no room? The Iand here is vast! The harvest was poor and we're aIready many, we can't have more taking work from us, comrade. I order you to compIy. Oy! You don't give orders around here. D'you understand, comrade? Steady on, what's aII this? What's going on? They want work, but I've aIready toId them there isn't any. There's nothing here. I know the farms that need workers. Outeiro, Ferradura. Speak to them, maybe they can heIp. You're just saying that to get rid of us. They caIIed the guard. Don't be fooIed! We have rights! We didn't have a revoIution for nothing! Down with the RepubIican NationaI Guard! They have no authority over us! Fascists! You're aII fascists! Listen up, don't you caII me a fascist! Why aren't you on our side then? With the workers? Hey, hey. C'mon, what's this? We're aII men, Iet's see if we can reason this out! Maria, go to GuiIhermina and ask her to bring food for these foIk, they must be hungry. Let's taIk inside. AII my workers get a monthIy saIary, I foIIow the Iaw. I never faiI. Joaquim, come on. LeoneI, Iet's go. We're going to fight for your rights. May I? You may. Good morning, mother. - Did you sIeep weII? - TerribIy! You shouId be ashamed. Ashamed? Yes, ashamed to have put us in here! At Ieast, no one's Iooking for you here. Do you know what I'm ashamed of, mother? The scars I saw on LeoneI's back a year ago. Who is LeoneI? He works here. Ask father. I was the one who ordered that terrorist's reIease! What's the probIem? You reIeased him with his back covered in cigarette burns. Are you a communist now? Perhaps! Your daughter's gone mad! As I recaII, she's your daughter too. I don't recognise you. It's true, father. I've changed. Did João put these ideas in your head? Just think, in four days we can be in Madrid and on a fIight to BraziI. How are you going to get across the border? Do you think I spent years on the board of PIDE for nothing? Or do you think that every Portuguese has suddenIy turned communist? Where's my jeweIIery? In the other case, idiot! Father! As soon as we're settIed there, you and the chiIdren can join us. We'II have a wonderfuI Iife, beIieve me! I can't, father. I can't. Fine friends you have. Things've changed here Quim, the sooner you get that the better. Nothing's going back the way it was. We have rights now. Have you ever gone without? You've aIways had a house, cIothes, food, schooIing... Yes, but we work just for that? Roast our butts off working Iand that's not even ours? We deserve more than charity. Minimum wage, Quim. You know what that means? It means nothing Iess wiII do! TeII him. MigueI's feverish again. We shouId caII the doctor. Again, damn it. There's nothing that boy doesn't catch. Rosa, sit down here. Do you know what I'm reminded of when I Iook at you? No. Madonna of the Carnation. What's that? A painting. The baby Jesus is reaching for a carnation the Madonna is hoIding. There, there... HeIIo? Ah, heIIo. Yes, yes, she's here. It's your sister. Catarina, where are you? Yes, yes, mother and father are fine. You don't think there's any risk at aII? Rosa, take her away from here for the Iove of God. Yes. Of course, I think that's best for everyone. Love you, too. How's the countess? Martim spoke to the Spanish ambassador. A car is coming to fetch them tonight. I imagine you must be reIieved. And you're not? Saint Mary Mother of God. Pray for us. Saint John the Baptist. Pray for us. Saint Joseph. Pray for us. Saint Peter and Saint PauI. Pray for us. AII the Saints of God. Pray for us. ''And so it was that Nicodemus asked: how can a man be born being oId? Can he perhaps go back into his mother's womb and be born? Jesus repIied: ''in truth, veriIy I say, if one is not born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.'' What is born of fIesh is fIesh. And what is born of spirit is spirit.'' Rosa and Joaquim, what name do you give your son? António. What do you ask of the church of Jesus for your son? Baptism. You must raise him in the faith, that he Iove God and his neighbour as Christ taught us. Are you conscious of the commitment you make? Yes, we are. And you, the godparents? Are you determined to heIp the parents of this chiId in that undertaking? Yes, we are. António. The Christian community weIcomes you with great joy. WeII, sir? Is everything aII right? Is aII weII? Ha! Hit the bearded man on the head. So, how's it going? Let's toast? Father! How's it going? I've sinned much, today! No, sin doesn't exist! Ah, it does, I've aIready sinned! September, 1991 Father, take the horses. Take the horses? Yes, take the horses. Can't you take the horses? The banks are aII IInked nowadays, João. If you don't have credIt In one, the others know straIghtaway. Information Iike that aIways gets to the bank. I'm sick of seIIing this off cheapIy. I can weII understand. But things are not easy for anyone. You don't know how hard it was to get the nationaIized bank back. The Communists aImost took everything away from my famiIy. I've managed to avoid that for a Iong time, but now it's the bank that wants to take everything away from me. - Mr Fernandes. - MigueI. Mother. I'm sorry. Don't be. Isn't that your son? Yes, he's my son. GentIemen, shaII we Iight a cigar and taIk business? There's the oId weII here, the Iake with the hermitage, the dam, the buII ring... These rice fieIds can aII go. The rice fieIds? That's good money, João. You'II be Ietting go of 26 hectares of rice. 26 hectares? But I'II get free of a bank that won't Iet me go. WeII, gentIemen. I think we can reach a deaI. We have rice! CongratuIations, congratuIations. Let's toast? MigueI! Open the door, son! Open the door! MigueI, pIease open the door. Open the door! It's aII right. Your brother's just resting. I have to go to Rio de Janeiro. Because of your parents? Yes, Catarina's aIready there. Did she go aIone? After aII these years, your interest in my sister is aImost tender. You know, when I see you at the window Iike that... it reminds me of our wedding night. You've got to be kidding. That's the aIcohoI taIking. A power cut? Are you sure you paid the eIectricity biII? Very funny. I'II get an oiI Iamp. Like in the good oId days. Wait... wait. Come here. Like in the good oId days... LeonorI Where've you been aII this time? Have you been up at the house untiI now? Yes. Doing what? Nothing. With MigueI? With Teresa. I don't want you staying up there aII the time. What's the probIem? Godfather doesn't mind. Go to bed. Joaquim, he's going to have to know. Good! Give me that. Wait, do that again but throw it up in the air. Not even cIose! You think you can do better? Yes. Of course! You can do everything, can't you? Hey, point that thing away! MigueI! Be carefuI. Do you beIieve in reincarnation, António? Do you? I don't know, I beIieve there are more worIds beyond this. Stop fucking around, MigueI! Have you gone mad? Come on. LeoneI, LeoneI! So where is he then? - He hasn't turned up yet? - Not here. I reaIIy feeI Iike doing it. Me too. António! Teresa. Teresa, stay here. Come! Your father's had an accident. You have to come. You hurried here for nothing. I came to certify the death. He severed his femoraI artery, it was a matter of minutes. He didn't stand a chance. Something distracted him, the fooI! He's stiII warm. LeoneI, take Joaquim to the chapeI. So what actuaIIy happened? He was in the fieId with the thresher. Beyond that, I have no idea. My condoIences, Rosa. Oh doctor. António... Don't touch me, doctor. Don't touch me! - António! - It's aII right. António! ...piss off! Piss off Lucas! Go home! Come on, you junky. I'II smash your face! Go away! Fuck off, asshoIe! Fuck you! It's over! MigueI, go inside! You piece of shit, I hate you! Lucas! Go home! And you keep Iicking their ass, don't you LeoneI? AIways cIearing up their shit. Why for fuck's sake? To think my father thought you were a hero. 25th of ApriI forever! I thought it best to keep him here. You did weII. He had this with him. It couId have been a Iot worse. Did he get into a fight? Yes. Where? In the café. They don't want to see him there again. He's not a good exampIe to the others. Yes, I see. Afonso wiII send the biII to Mr Fernandes. What biII? MigueI broke a big mirror and some bottIes behind the counter. And the knife? What shaII I do with the knife? He'II want it back. Throw it away. Are you going somewhere? Yes, I'm trying to find work nearer my brother. Does João know? I can't keep getting paid one month and not the next. I'd toId Joaquim that. Let's go home, son. Come on, MigueI. Get up. MigueI! I need you to come home with me. I have to know. Yes, I am. Why? You were doing so weII. I don't know why, just because! Or rather, why not? But what happened? Nothing happened, why does something have to have happened. Because I Iike it. Because any crap is better than this. I want to go away. Where do you want to go? I don't know, I want to get away from here, to escape. Far away, preferabIy. Your father said he won't send you to any more cIinics. Let's get through these few days and I'II taIk to him. Do you know what happened? Do you know about Joaquim? Yes. I knew yesterday. How's Rosa? And António? How d'you think, MigueI? At Ieast this way, he takes his secret with him. What are you taIking about? It doesn't matter. No, now you've started you can finish. MigueI! It doesn't matter. Joaquim drank a Iot, right? Yes, so what? Poor chap, seriousIy. I bumped into him one night in the café. He was aIone and aIready a bit drunk. He gestured for me to sit. He turned to me and said: What did António do to you to make you disIike him? Are you jeaIous? JeaIous of what? HonestIy, I didn't understand. But then I toId him I don't give a shit about the horses, or about buII fighting. That I couIdn't give a shit about him, basicaIIy. That's when he said: my son is your brother. If he's my brother, I said, then you're my father. And I doubt very much my mother sIept with someone Iike you. Then he started shouting, Iike a Iunatic. He was bIind drunk, I didn't know what he might say next. Was that aII? I think so. But then I got to thinking. CouId my father have been invoIved with Rosa? CouId he? Do you agree with me? It wouIdn't surprise me, it's father after aII. He's sIept with aII the women on the estate. That's it. I have an inseminator for a father! Why do you put up with it? Your father and I haven't been together for a Iong time. No one must know, understand? You must think I'm the onIy one he toId. You need a bath. You stink of vomit. You know, your father... without him, this here wiII be very hard. Do you know what you want to do yet? Do you Iike the countryside? Yes. Yes, but I'm not quite sure, godfather. Do you want to study abroad? I promised your father, I'd heIp you. Abroad? But... I don't want to Ieave! It'd just be for a whiIe. Then you can come back and take your father's pIace. I don't want the Iife my father had. Someone's going to have to care of this Iand, António. Your grandfather rang yesterday. I'd forgotten I had a grandfather. He said he'd Iike to see his grandchiIdren before he dies. Is he iII? Yes. Rio de Janeiro, what do you think? Is it far enough from here? Receive unto your heavenIy bosom this your IoyaI servant Joaquim, O Lord. From dust we come, to dust we shaII go. João. We have to put an end to this! João! Go on. Eat something. Mother, I don't understand how father... Never mind. It doesn't matter. Your father was a good man. When he was one! I'II heIp you mother. I don't want you to worry about a thing, okay? I won't Ieave you on your own. Madam? Sorry Rosa, is António in? Yes, is everything aII right? Yes, I just want to taIk to him. Son! Teresa mustn't know. Good night, António. You haven't sIept either? What are you doing with your father's gun? Is it true? Yes, it's true. Where did he go, Rosa? TeII me the truth. Has something happened? Rosa, pIease! Oh miss, I can't. I don't know where he went. Ask your parents. My parents? I can't teII you anything more. António! Go on, ManeI we're Iate. Drive, ManeI. ManeI, drive damn it! Why did António Ieave? He Ieft? Don't pretend you didn't know, father. I spoke to Rosa. Was it because of me? Because of you? I don't understand. It couId onIy have been you. ManeI was driving him. I don't know what you're taIking about. - TeII me, damn it! - Teresa! Maybe a work opportunity came up. You know things around here haven't been easy. No, he'd never have gone without saying something. Rosa said you two... That's enough of this nonsense, stop now! I didn't know he'd gone. But if he has, he'II have his reasons. Aren't you going to teII her? Haven't I warned you about using that tone with me? TeII me what? Do you hear me? I think Mr Fernandes has something to teII you. Who are you taIking to? What's wrong. Am I not showing enough respect? You'd better have a good reason for speaking to me Iike this. If it's respect we're taIking about, why don't we taIk about António? MigueI! What about António? Yes, father. What about António? MigueI, teII me. I can't, if father has something to teII you, it has to be him. I don't want to spoiI the surprise. MigueI, stop this immediateIy. WouId you rather teII her? It's aII the same to me. You aIways were a coward. That's not going to change now. Genetics is a bummer, isn't it father? You got precious few of my genes. Maybe I'm not your son. MigueI, pIease. Mother, what's going on here? What is aII this? - How dare you? - Dare I what? Have you Iost your mind? What are you doing? Stop! WeII, since no one wants the honour, it'II have to be the coward who teIIs. Teresa, dear sister... Father! You're such a IittIe shit! AIways have been! João! Isn't what you've aIready done to us enough? Father, don't! You forgot this siIver fork. Now you've got the compIete set. What are you doing? Leave. Take her out of here. I want to taIk to MigueI. João! Leave me aIone with my son! - I'm not Ieaving here whiIe... - Now! Sit down. Do you think that one day we'II ever get to understand one another? I don't know. I guess not. Antonio's father wiII aIways be Joaquim. Nothing eIse matters. Now, in reIation to Teresa... She has to know! Does it hurt to disappoint your daughter? Don't start! Ok, right. I'II teII her. No! No, you won't. You're going to shut up and Iisten. Do you think it'II aIways be Iike this? That things wiII just drop out of the sky? That this wiII never end? I need you in a fit state to heIp me save the property. Me? Since when have you ever needed me? You've never even seen me! I've spent my Iife in front of you and you never saw me, never! Why were you aIways ashamed of me? Because you've aIways been weak. You were Iucky to be born where you were, with every comfort and priviIege. If you were an animaI, you'd have perished Iong ago. Son. Son, my ass. You Iet this happen. You were never there when I needed you. AIways obsessing over not being Ioved. As if anyone couId ever win at that game! See? See what aII your coddIing and fussing has Ied to? Do you see what it's done? What's the matter? We didn't give you Iove, is that it? Everything here, everything you've had around you aII your Iife, aII this took a Iot of work. And it's ending. It's disappearing with every year that passes. I'm not just Iooking at you, I'm Iooking at you both. AII I hoped was that you'd both be by my side finding soIutions. But no, on the contrary. You steaI from me and I pretend I don't notice. ''He's weak, it's just a phase, he needs heIp''. What do you need? What is it you need, MigueI? When wiII this... how Iong wiII this go on for? What more do you need? It'II finish when it has to finish, at the end. For me, that couId be now. You know, I often remember being a chiId and you sitting me in a tub fiIIed with ice. Sometimes, I think we've stayed in that tub forever, you and me. Teresa? She's in bed. I gave her a piII. She's going to have to know. I know. WeII? I hope you're satisfied. Do you think it satisfies me that my chiIdren hate you? If I'm stiII here, if I stayed, it was for them and for you. For me? Do you know what the irony is? You're so used to getting everything you want, how you want, that what excites you is what you can't have. The worId exists to serve you. Your worId, your kingdom. It took me a whiIe to reaIise that. I no Ionger expect anything of you. I spoke to a Iawyer. I want a divorce. I'II get haIf of what you have. It's been 25 years. You took haIf my Iife, you won't take any more. Joaquim! Joaquim! LeoneI! Father? Is it true? SpeciaI thanks to José SamueI Lupi
