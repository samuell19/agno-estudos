We've invited 50. 100 will turn up uninvited. 200 with children. When is it, Mr. Joorabchi? -Thursday night, Friday. And Saturday, engagement and wedding. And the day after. That's great! A great hour, a great night, the first night of the month. Congratulations! He's an only child. The girl isn't a stranger either. She's a relative of my wife. - Great! Have you printed the invites? I forgot to give it to you. Here you go. Thank you. I'm too busy. It's for Majid. He loves to attend our clients' events. Whether it's a wedding or funeral. - God help him. You're all busy with him too. Bye for now. -Take care. The bride is Yadollah's sister. They're decent people. We've asked a few musicians for the men and singers for the women. - Great. My condolences. - Brother. My friend, my heart is broken. So tall. He died in an accident, he was 18. So suddenly. A lorry was coming the opposite way, the driver was asleep. His helper was driving. My brother, had sneezed when he was about to leave the house. Our mother dreamt of a tooth falling out. She kept asking him not to go. He said no. Look out. That's what happens when you're meant to go. He died there and then. The body arrived in Tehran last night. The relatives were told through the night. Bad news travels quickly. They've turned the house into a blood bath. Yes. Only a depressed bird could appreciate the grass. Only a brother would appreciate a brother's death.

We're here for the two shining stars. Round of applause for the bride and groom. We'll be starting the wedding performance for our guests. The band here. One... two... Go get Majid. Can I go in? 1... 2... 3... 4... testing. I'll give you a kiss. This isn't some joke. Thanks for coming. - Mr Joorabchi. Well, Mr Zoroofchi, I'm waiting for Majid. I won't let you go. - It's late. You're tired. - I wish it was always for weddings. It's only a cup of tea, please. Majid... Let him have his fun. Come in, please. He's happy this way. Let him dance a little. Where's the funeral? - My brother's grave, Ebn Babevei... Our family graveyard... Habib, Majid is stuck under a drain. We were there to explore and he went under. His head is stuck in the mud. Won't you go help your own brother? Why did you go under there again? I was exploring. Relax. I'm always relaxed. I found a chain. It's German. Look Why didn't you come to the shop? Today is Friday, our day off. Today is Monday, a long time till Friday. No! The calendar dad gave me says today is Friday. It's an old calendar. Friday is when dad says it is. Whether he's alive or dead. We have to respect the dead, the clergy said. You look like a hobo. Wash it all off. You look like a miner. - Damn it, it's hot. Wash under your chin. Your neck. The room is cold, you'll get ill. You'll get ill looking at your crap in here. It's totally worth it. Brother Habib, I can fix this. Don't you think? Stop this nonsense. Habib, I... Want this week's... And next week's in advance. Don't waste it on junk food. - No! I'll give you a kiss. I'll do it. You've got mud in your ears. Crap! Nothing can hold me down. I'm feeling great, God bless. All of this free stuff didn't come around so easy. I've spent my whole life exploring. My dad used to lend dishes, I've become an explorer. Majid Zoroofchi, explorer. Rusty nail, rusty chain. Rusty Tarzan. Rusty watch. Pay attention. Rusty clock. It won't chime anymore because it's rusty. We're brothers. We're made of the same clay, but from different ovens. Your oven was official, ours was temporary. Your heads are circular, mine is weird. Lucky it didn't get worse. The normal ones. Those on the other side. Those... Those who once your dad died left you in this room. They'll take everything. Habib is one person. They're an entire group. Habib's head looks like theirs. Not mine. He's their real brother. But my step-brother. Their real brother. My step-brother. Their real brother. If they said I search in the mud... Say your in-law is a doctor. Liars are God's enemies! You've so many enemies, God! We're your friends. A group of demented people, who you were mean to. It's my dad's jacket. It smells like my dad. So does the air. The air smells like my dad. He'd sit me down on his knee saying Little boy... I swear... The past is gone. My leg has swollen up. It's because of the salt. - Here. Salt is bad for you, auntie. It's not that, I'm just old. Never mind. No one is worried about your aunt. Other than Habib, shame he's wasting his life on his step-brother, who belongs in a mental hospital. God help him. God bless all young people. Did you take water to Habib? I'll take it now. This is a bonus. You're it. Are you comfortable? When I go to leave out your bed I close the doors, I draw the curtains, lay under your blanket. But I get cold when I'm alone. Women's bodies are cold even in the summer, but men are warm even in winter. I'd go to my dad's bed when I was younger. I'd get under his blanket. His bed was so warm. Now it's not just the morning, I feel cold all night. It is cold. Wear more clothes. I'm shivering from the inside. This month's rent. Leave it on the heater. Men feel embarrassed to take money off women. It's your dad's house. If this was your house or I was poor, then it'd be different. Thank God I make enough money. I came to Tehran from Shiraz to become a tailor. I became one myself. I opened up my own place. I put my home town and relatives behind me. Instead of months I stayed for years. My parents don't reply to my letters. They don't recognise me. God knows. And so you should know too. They say do you want it? I say I do. Him wanting it too is a wholly different matter. My heart is with you. They ask why doesn't he marry you then? Tell them he has an ill brother. Everyone has gone. Tell them there's only Habib. Habib has to be everything to him. He's the one who's lonely. If you decide I'll live along side him. I'll take care of him in every way. Since you care about lonely people... I'm the lonely one. Your loneliness is different from his. It's like... God and I. God is alone. Iron is God's greatness. Pomegranates are made in heaven. How annoying it sounds. That's the sound of the female attracting the male. Dear athletes Hello to you You may start now First move An exercise for the arms On the count of 1 Arms up Start 1... 2... 3... 4... They have The Sun Angel on. They're showing Doctor Satan. - No. And The Scorpion. I've seen it all. Give us some sunflower seeds. Here. Go down the front. Did you see? Give me a cherryade. - Here. Take it. Why did you beat him up? I paid for the cherryade. Let him go. So what if he had it? - Clear off. Why did you steal and make me look bad? Get out of here. Give me a ticket. No. 10 tickets. I got tickets for me alone. 10 tickets. - Just for me. I'll give you a kiss. It's pink satin. - He's a friend. He's Habib's brother. He's simple. Doesn't know the difference. I wish he was as crazy. I want it for Saturday, for an engagement party. It'll be ready Tuesday night. I said I'd give the fabric to Forogh Zaman. Her place is women only and she's good. She'll come to tell you the style. Don't have the collar open. No shorts sleeves either. Outside the cinema her hand could touch other men's hands. Is this a thread spool? It is. Bye, Forough. - Thanks for coming. Is this white chalk? Yes. It tastes good. She'll tell you what style she wants. When will she be coming? - Soon. Wait there. Give me a new poem. - 1 Gheran. New poems are 1 gheran. I'll give you a kiss. New poems are 1 gheran. Majid... - What bastard is Majid? I'm Jim, they took the girl away in Tarzan's escape. They fed the girl to the crocodiles. They ate one of her legs. It was me and King Kong. We battered their leader. My brother is an iron man, do you know him? My brother could take the girl back. It's a stupid world. There's no one to take my hand and say Shazam! Take me to St Davoud to cheer me up. There are noises in my head. Things are moving in there. Who are you? Your brother has sent me to take you to St Davoud. Don't put me in that small room in the same house as them. If my brother finds out he'll poke your eyes out. Your brother is too old to do that. Is it your shift tonight? It's day and night now. Where have you been, friend? The literate man who got the most lashes. My friend, I've not seen you for ages. If you weren't so troublesome... You'd be someone by now. After the punishment we both got I left medicine. Good. I became my dad's assistant. But there were no painkillers here for me. Other than alcohol. We're open 24/7 now. I drink continuously so I don't feel sober. Just like you who used your brother as an excuse. What about Fridays? One of the flowers of Valikhan could help him in a way that you can't. Once I sent him along with other single men to the place. When he realised what the women's jobs were he didn't touch them and became worse for a while. It's knowledge that harms us the most. He doesn't have to know who the woman is. Talk to one of them. Have her come over once a week. Just like anything else, Thursday night when everyone goes to your sister's for mourning. Do I tell Majid the woman was sent by Stalin? Say she's there to look after the house. Majid doesn't talk to anyone to find out the truth. That's his remedy. A woman. Doctor's prescription. I know a middleman who has good cases. He takes girls to high up people. I'll contact him. Look what I have to do now. Stretching my legs. 4 Seasons plates and bowl. Kettles. You asked for a car? No - Aren't you Habib Zoroofchi? I am, yes. It's out on the street. You better take a look. Then we'll talk about the price. Why did you bring the car here? Who knows who she is? Thursday nights. Now you better come back tonight to talk. As to what she has to do, come back tonight, I'll show you the house. - OK. Come on, auntie. - Coming, love. We're always late. Pray for me. You're so lucky to get to go. You'll go to heaven. My world is Yazid's hell. Who'd take me? You don't belong, Majid. You're miserable enough. Your heart is a blood bath. I'll kiss you, I'll do it. Habib isn't into these ceremonies. He was holding a handkerchief at dad's funeral. And he'd hit himself. On the 40th night he was wearing glasses so no one could see him cry. After my dad he... took care of me. And mourned for me. The miserable one. OK, I cried enough. I hope the good deed goes for my brother who isn't into these ceremonies. Habib has said as of this Thursday which is my Monday when everyone is gone: Someone is coming to watch the house. She's a woman. Falling in love. No one is home other than me, her and God. God isn't against love. Hey, melon head, don't be ungrateful. You're a decent person. I'll give you a kiss, I'll do it. I'll do it. What's your name? Aghdas, what about you? My name is Majid Zoroofchi. Is this an arm or the gold bazaar? Is this a greenhouse or kitchen? It's like hell. The flowers died with my dad and the cleaner took them. My dad is buried in Abdullah's shrine. God bless his soul. Did you know Haji Zoroofchi? - Yeah. Where from? Careful not to swallow the needle. Pin not needle. As you say. On your way. First or last. - Go to Rasht. Go. We won't get there on time. - Coming, love. If it wasn't for the ceremony where I could cry and feel better, I'd explode. I gave away my daughter, I gave away my son. I'm here all alone. He said let's go stealing. He said what do we steal? He said the king's gold. He said what do we say to God? Me, the big headed kid. Your button has fallen off. It's because I'm single. Your button falls off, you can't sleep at night. And when you do, you have to shower in the morning. I'd sew it if you had a needle and thread. This is magical. There's everything in there. You're watching our house on Thursday nights but what do you do on other days? Not everyone goes away on Thursdays, Everyday is God's day. Stand up straight. Everything belongs to God. Everything. Even Tarzan belongs to God. Will you search my head? Yeah, lay your head here. Do you know the story of the jeweller's daughter and the king's son? The jeweller's daughter, how much are the stars in the sky? King's son, how much are the tree leaves? Stars in the sky are the same. How old are you? 20-ish. - Do you have a husband? No. Have you been married? No. Would you get married? Will you marry me? No. If I do, what would you use to hit me? With my soft tail. Wow look who's here, the long necked girl. Have you fallen out with me? - I'm not in the mood. Are you unwell? Is it your back? Have you had an abortion? No, I'm not working. You've been eating the best food for a week. You've not left the place. How come you get dressed up on Thursday night. and go problem solving at Zoroofchi's house. One of these days the doctor's car will have to be sold for Aghdas's debts. Take my bed, radio and whatever for my debts. Take my gold too. Wait a minute. Who would you give up your gold for? Giving up everything with even more on top. Like Homa says, your dreams are small. Remember Mina Cigari? She fell in love. Love isn't for people like us. Get up and don't ruin your life. Wait a little and if I don't get you a house and a car they don't call me doctor for nothing. The German guy has called a million times from the Grand Hotel. If you'd learned "good morning" and "good night" instead I'd tell them you'd come from abroad. I make you look like a foreigner. Your place looks better than a hotel room. What else do you want? Get up, the car is filled with food. Let's go out of town for a break. You'll be miserable here. Get up. What are you looking for in there? My mother's husband didn't rape me and take my virginity at 17. Your lover won't stop saying your name. I'll show you. Don't you dare do that. If you don't get up I'll pour boiling water on you. Shut up, you addict. This walnut. Now say... Now hit those two. I will. You won, let me crack it for you. Open up. You spilt it on me. Now you stay at home and clean. I'll go to the office to work. Who is it? It's Majid Zoroofchi. Hi. What's for dinner? - Bread and butter. Let's eat in the garden. The plants have grown. So pack up. We should go to sleep after dinner. Guess which one it's in. Let's bet. - On what? Winner chooses. - OK. In here. Say open it. - Open it. Empty. In here. You said you wouldn't hit me. Is this it? I hope you get your arms chopped off. You stupid idiot. Karim, your tea will get cold. It's cold. What if the bird feels cold. It's not that cold. You've been cold lately, Karim. It'd be better if you'd remarry than buying this bird. Another wife. It's not about wanting a lover. Love is something else. Lovers are after marriage. He has no life. If a lover is lucky enough and is smart he might get what he wants. And what I got was a lot more than I asked for. It's Shahkarak. It's full. Her voice is great. Only one can sing like this. The rest are ordinary, they just sing. A baby is a lot better. My dad didn't deserve this much respect. You're all mental. You're just like your brother. -You stupid woman. Get under there and shut up. Shut it! Shut it! Shut it! She's singing. Dress up. What's happening? - A carpet seller. Forget carpets. The guy who gave you your carpet. I'm not in the mood. - Are you on your period? - No, I'm not in the mood. What's all of this for? The retarded boy? For me to enjoy myself. - Borrow first. Don't you be begging when it's time for your bills. I won't struggle. I wanted to give you this opportunity. It's not the end of the world, I'll take someone else. Close down your business. Bitch. - Go smoke something. Bitch! 54. Is your mum there? Don't mention my name. I want to borrow one of the girls. Yeah the guy is a diplomat, he's filthy rich. I'll pay. Say you're taking her shopping. I'll be waiting. Take her to a salon, say it's for me. Yeah, right now. No accents, well dressed. Why did you call from here? Or else you'd be homeless. Bitch! Here. That's their son. Here. Do you play cards? Can you play? I got it so you'd teach me. - What shall we bet on? Bet is on... Winner chooses, OK? No cheating, don't forget the slap. 50 points. You deal. Here. Higher or lower? Higher. 1. I got a point. I got it, here. 36. 40. 43... 48. 57. 58... 59... 60. 61. 62. I won. Here, you take the rest. I won. Tickle my feet. Here. You're not the first. You're not. I've fallen in love with so many before. The girl in the frame at the photography place. Then the girl who sold tickets at Roshan cinema. I wanted you to know. But until they bury me next to my dad, it'll be you. If you weren't the first... You are the last. When a girl gives up her gold that's it. Wise move. It's God's word. God says so. The best thing for a woman is monogamy. I'm not Satan. If one day you're walking down the street and you see me, don't panic. I'll pretend I don't know you. I bring people luck. I've sent so many people to their homes, you're not the first. I'll miss you. I got used to you. To your moods, your fights and friendship. But to hell with my heart. I hope you're happy. I'm here in the backyard. What happened to all of that gold? It's all gone. I sold it. I'll buy you better ones. Here. Your necklace, wear it, Another necklace. Earrings. Here's... The other one. This is, give me your wrist. And your other wrist. Take a look at yourself. Look. Look at yourself. See. Right. Here... that's your watch. What time is it? We've 15 minutes to half past. You're supposed to walk away from things. You shouldn't fall for people. I won't let the woman come over anymore. If I'm your guardian I say no. You should say OK. There are so many women out there. I'm your older brother. You can't marry before me. If... you don't feel well we can go to the shrine. Tear them up. I'll give you money. Throw them in. Hi. Can you get me and Aghdas married? Go in. I've rented it for 3 tomans a month from Mash Mohammad. There was nothing in it. I made it look good for the bride. There's a huge garden. And a little room for plants. We're neighbours to the cows. Come here. It's good. Mirror and the Quran. Here. Other side. Yes. You. Here. It's not dangerous. You're almost done. Look over here. Nothing is going to happen. Look into this hole. Ready. Go. Bread and radio. I'll give you a kiss. Here. I'll give you a kiss. Where's Majid? He went to the store. He didn't come home last night. I have to know where he was. I'm his brother. You've a brother yourself. I had one, a baby. My mum had anaemia she couldn't feed him. I'd come here to get milk for him. Like I do now for my boss's baby. My dad said he couldn't pay for the milk. My mum didn't feed him milk anymore. He got fat at first. Then he died. - Get yourself whatever you want. Take me somewhere, arm in arm. Just like married couples do. It was the latest model. I wore it for you... ten, fourteen years ago, when I had come here from Shiraz. It was winter. It was snowing. It's like it was yesterday. Majid was sliding on the ice. Karim had his slingshot. To hit the crows on the tree. Mother was peeling green beans. I remember... You had green beans and rice. The old man was hunched over in his jacket. He was getting bread for the birds. He was a pile of bones. But he was leading our destiny. I wanted to take his place. I wanted to be the man of the house. I ruined everyone's lives. I wanted to do this place up for us. For you. The ceiling has come down. The ground is old. That winter, ten, fourteen years ago. The day we had green beans and rice... You were wearing military clothes. Your button had fallen off. You said... - Mother can't see. Could you sew my button, tailor? You said... - I've a name. You were pale skinned... Just like snow and blood. You wasted my life. I didn't care back then. I wasn't worried for your father either. I was in love with you. If you... If you let someone die a virgin... I took the Hafez today and opened it. This was the poem. We're being tested for our luck in this town. It's time to leave this town. Hafez wouldn't lie to me. He's from my home town. Since I was tall enough to reach the shelf there was a Quran and a Hafez there. Now I can reach the other side of the shelf. I'll go to Khorasan. I've some savings. A new life. No one should come to say goodbye. Not you. Or auntie. Or Zinat Sadat. I'll go somewhere new. Where are you? I'll give you a kiss. I asked no one to come here. I came here to stop you from leaving. Go back to the shop, Habib will be worried. I've a wife of my own. One who is beautiful. I've her picture. Here, look. I'm fine now, I'm not possessed anymore. The night I stayed out I was... with her. I was with her. Let's go home. I'll show you our home. We live in a barn, come see for yourself. So you came here everyday. Your excuse was milk. You came here for honey. She's done her eyebrows too. If I make her a dress she'll look even better. You, you talk to him. Stop it. - I swear I'm too shy. Stay here, I'll call you. I wasn't supposed to go. He said to come back home. Habib is the love of your life. Don't be surprised, Habib. You'll hear some good news tonight. Majid is married. A beautiful girl, who's so innocent. I think the girl is the caretaker's daughter. They've built a place in the barn and started their life together. Let's go. Take the bride home. The groom is hiding outside. Come in. If you let us we can take the bride home. You're the first bride. You're in charge. Get your eyebrows done. We'll have two brides tomorrow. The groom is happy too. I've grown old with you. Well, the groom... Good thing we got what we wanted. If I said don't marry Aghdas, but the girl, was a wise choice. An innocent girl. A housewife. But Aghdas was different. A woman who got paid to sleep with people. The lights have gone out. We are lucky though. The girl was temporary. She was the doctor's prescription. He said she'd be good for you. The devil is hitting me over the head. Brother, take me to the shrine tonight. Tonight? In the middle of winter? Wait until tomorrow. No, please. I don't want my wife to know. For her to know I'm crazy. If you decide to set off tomorrow I'll sleep here tonight. Love is like a disease. We're here. We're always... Late.
