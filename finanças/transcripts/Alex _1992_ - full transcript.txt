Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn. Don't worry, Alex. - From Singapore? [laughing] - [Girl] Must have fed her on atomic rice. And her mom, talk about posh. You got some competition now, Alex.

All of them lining up like that. - She's lovely and tall. - They're stumbling over each other to see who will get into the cow pack first. - None of them will from what I hear. She likes all the boy's parts in the school plays. - Oh, yes. - I told my slimy creature he was wasting his time. Sport, sport, sport, one real person could be a mile. All she does is swim. - Maggie's a swimmer. - Maggie's petite. Not six foot six and built like a tank. - So what's the attraction? - Mt.

There's only seven months to the nationals. - Are you comfy, dear? - And you just lost two of 'em. - She didn't do it on purpose. - I know, but ... - And she's got exams. Boy, out. - Maggie Benton will be using those two months to get better and better. - I can beat Maggie Benton. - Alex, she's not just another hopeful. She's like you. She's very, very good. - I can still catch up. - Oh, while you're catching up on the hockey and the ballet and the ... - Mercado, yes. - And exams, young lady. - Yes. - Well, you're not super woman. - I can do it. - If you give everything else up. - Yes, I can do it.

Then you could have worked the pedal and taken the exam. - Yes, Miss Daily. - So my dad still won't listen. - I've got time. I know I have. I can beat her, I know I can. One race and everyone thinks she's wonder woman. - Women do not make good doctors, Julia. Now stop upsetting your mother. He says I can be a nurse though. - You want to be a doctor. - Yes, but ... - Then stand up to him. Be one. [upbeat music] - [Voiceover] A new era begins for Auckland's [mumbling]. The ribbon is shot as the city's view ... - Be careful. - Sorry dear. - [Voiceover] Before cars are allowed over the young and old gather for their one and only chance to cross Auckland's new landmark on two legs. - I'm going to do that. - [Voiceover] On a countdown to Rome 1960 Australia's golden girls continue intensive training for the crucial summer season. Here in their Queensland training camp Dawn Fraiser and her teammates carry out a brutal daily schedule, but they don't mind. They've got their sights set on Olympic gold. Meanwhile, on the home front, things haven't gone as swimmingly for local champion Alex Archer. Defeated by newcomer Maggie Benton with a record breaking swim. Then a sports injury leaves her leg in plaster. While Archer has to stand on the sidelines, Benton's training times continue to get faster making her the likely favorite for Olympic selection. Alex doesn't seem to like it. Still it's hard to be a swimming champ when you can't go near the water. - Don't you knock any wings off. It was weird seeing you up on the screen like that. - Yes, in plaster. One event and the camera had to be there. - [speaking Italian] - Is that Italian? - Yeah. You are a very good looking girl. - What's that? - It's my dad's phrase book. He served in Italy. [speaking Italian] Is your daughter respectable and free of disease? - Let's see. [laughing] Is this water all right to drink. Dull brain. - He also had this. His old Roman coin. That's the way they got him back. You want it? - Yeah. - The day you qualify for Rome. - All right. - Oh. Would you like tea in here? - Yes, thanks mom. - And to get Alex a chair. - She's okay, aren't you Alex? - A chair. - I shouldn't be lying on your bed. [speaking Italian] I am a good girl. Yes, my mom warned me about boys like you. [laughing] - Maybe she was right? - [Mom] Alex, Andy? [crashing] - Would you like salt or lemons with your tea? - Lemon tea would be fine, thanks mom. [laughing] Is there anything else around here you wanna wreck? Aw, come on. It'll be off in two weeks. - Two weeks. - Then you'll beat them. - Maggie Benton first. [whistle blows] - [Voiceover] Take your marks. [gun shot] [cheering] - How about two more on Maggie Benton for the next one? Hmm? Yeah? - Sure. [whistle blows] - Take your marks. [gun shot] - Her leg is slowing her down, probably. - Head, head. - And the first race of the new season a clear win to Maggie Benton. - Does it still hurt? - No, it just doesn't do everything it should. But it will. You wait 'til next time. - Alex, wait. Alex? - Alex, so glad to see you're back. - Thanks. - Has Maggie told you about Australia? - I was just about to, mother. - She's training in Queensland for the next four weeks with some of the best swimmers in the world. - Oh. Good. - Come along, dear. - Well, I guess I'll see you when I get back then. - Improving a hell of a lot, aye, but eh. - Queensland. [alarm clock rings] [upbeat piano music] - 43, 44. [singing] - Alex, I did it. Dad says I can be a doctor. - Great. - I have to get a pass on my exams, of course, but that won't stop me. - Exams. - I'm trying. - And Maggie's in Queensland. - I know. - Concentrating on her swimming. You were gonna give everything else up. - I never said that. [peaceful music] - Don't push him too far. - I'm not pushing anyone. - Except yourself. And I know why. Because of this, senorina. - Signorina. Coming in? - No, I better get home. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Buonanotte. - Alex, it's nearly 11. - [Mrs. Archer] Alex. - Goodnight. - How's that? I'll stay an hour later. - Each day? Perhaps two. - You know I can't. - [Mr. Jack] I do, I do. Ballet, hockey, the piano, acting, tiddly winks. No, you give them up and train. Then you'll catch Maggie Benton. - I don't need to give them up. - Yes, you do. The seasons about to start. - No. - Your next race is a week away. - Yes and I'll win it. - Oh no, you won't. - Then what are we bothering for? Why are we doing this? - You should know. - I don't know. I don't care. - You can't do every bloody thing and swimming. - Then I'll jack it in. I don't care. - Suit yourself. - Yes, I will. - You always bloody do. [somber music] - Hi. Lemonade, apples and some Andrew Richmond Dagwood specials. Mutton, tomato, fish paste and cold potato. - Tell Mr. Jack I'm finished. - He didn't send me. - I'm not going back. - All right, it's your decision. - Oh come on, Andy. You must have an opinion. Everybody knows what Alex Archer should be doing. - I've known you too long to try telling you what to do. - I just wanna be myself. - Okay. - It's okay for you. You could dress up how you like on stage. You could do half a dozen things and it wouldn't matter who you were, what size you were. You're a boy, but me. I've got to be a proper girl, but I'm too tall to be a proper girl. I know that. At the dance I was a big joke. She's strange. All she does is swim. Now Mr. Jack says I don't swim enough. I just wanna be myself and nobody will let me do that. - But giving up swimming? - I'll do what I want to do. - I think that makes you very strong. - Big girls are strong. - Strong enough to start swimming again? - Yes, if I wanted to. - Do you wanna go back? - No. - Alex. I'd like to help as much as I can. I mean that. I think you can do it your way. There's nobody like you. - I haven't got a coach now. Have I? [chattering and giggling] - All right, all right. Stay under as long as you like. Are they coming? There they go. Yeah. Can we all ... - Chow. - Giving everything else up? - No, signor. - Signorina, keeping up your Italian, huh? - Si. - I learned a bit of Italian in the war, you know? Pretty rough stuff, though. Not what you'd find in your phrase books. - Si. - Well. If you don't give me 110% from now on you'll learn every bloody word of it. - Si, signor. Grazie. - All right, now give me a lap. Fresco. [sighs] - Take your marks. [gun shot] [cheering] [upbeat music] - [Voiceover] A clean start and straight away Maggie Benton and Alex Archer setting a very strong pace. - Come on, Alex. - Archer is really closing the gap. Getting back to her old strength in this the first of three races today. - Take your marks. [gun shot] - Second race this afternoon and the pace just as strong. [cheering] - 20 says Maggie takes this one. - You're on. - Come on, Alex. - Alex, keep your head up. - Two outta three to Maggie Benton. Alex Archer can't afford to lose this one. [gun shot] [intense music] - Care to double it? - This third race, every bit as hard fought as the first two and like the first two Maggie Benton really showing the benefit of the Queensland training. [cheering] - And another one for Maggie Benton. [cheering and applause] - I've seen a lot of dolphins off this point. - Dolphins? - Yeah. - When I was little I wanted to be a dolphin. It was the most important thing in the world. - What's important now? - The Rome Olympics. Beating Maggie Benton. - Yeah, but I doubt a gold medal would impress the dolphins. - What the hell have they got to do with it? - Alex. I want you to win, but it won't make any difference to us if you don't. - You think I won't win? - No, I just meant ... - Tell it to the dolphins, Andy. - [Andy] Alex, what are you doing? Alex! - So you don't think I can do it? - Get on board. Alex! - Think I'm gonna drown, Richmond? - Grab on. - No. I'm going to swim back. - Not against the tide, get in. Always wanna be in control, don't ya? Here, put this on. [peaceful music] - Andy? I've been pretty tough to live with, haven't I? You, my family, Mr. Jack? - You've been pretty tough on yourself. I do think you can win. - I'll still come in second. - No. You're winning. ♪ For the rest of my life ♪ I'll be with you ♪ When the sun shines hot ♪ And the winds blow cool ♪ For the rest of my life ♪ I'll go with you ♪ To the ends of the earth and further ♪ - Gotta go to that thing. ♪ If you want me to - We gotta make going to Australia.

You know, like in slow motion. - I am at the swimming pool, aren't I? - All right, so what's the difference between ballet and swimming? - Heaps. - Is there? You've got the movement, the precision, coordination and the grace. Now you need all of that in swimming too. How you hold your head and your turn. Those are your weak points. - But I ... - Now, now. We'll call this a ballet lesson. Now what I want you to do is to take four slow strokes, all right? And then a summer salt and then another four strokes and another summer salt. - Hey. - All the way to the end of the pool. Capisce, signorina? [sighs] - One, two, three, four and turn.

Sliding down the wall now that's like your toe in the shoe, right? In the pirouette, it's the pivot. Now you keep that central, you keep it secure, okay. [peaceful music] - Too close. Okay. Right, now think ballet, okay? Think of the precision, the grace and the pirouette, just pirouette, right? Ugh. Okay, all right. There ha ha, very good. Come on, again, up you go. [peaceful music] - Right, now down to the turn and do me a lap. And go! Remember the ballet. Poise, the coordination, the grace. That's it, come on. All right, you're on time at the halfway. On time.

The nationals main championships starting in Nadi tomorrow will decide which of the two, Maggie Benton or Alex Archer will be selected for the New Zealand Olympics. - I wish we were coming with ya. Win or lose you're still my girl. - [Voiceover] Thank you for your attention ladies and gentlemen. Remember tomorrow's highlights the clash between Miss Alex Archer and Miss Maggie Benton for the Nationals Bridge Title. - Ah Alex. You'll be here for the relay tonight. - I'm racing tomorrow. Ask Maggie. [laughing] - I'm asking you. - I'm going to bed early. - Miss Archer, Miss Archer. - Sorry. - Thank you. [clock ticking] - Sorry, did I wake you? Hey, I got the silver. - That's good. - I got the silver, I got the silver. [waves crashing] [seagulls chirping] [thunder roaring] [clock ticking] [sighs] [somber music] - Ah. - Alex Archer, isn't it? What on earth are you doing here? - I was wondering if I could have a swim. - Well, I'm closing up. [somber music] - You feeling better? - Not really, thanks. - Would you like me to run you back? - I'll be all right. Night. [somber music] [horn honking] [thunder roaring] [cheering] [applause] - Alex? That was a heat. You only have to qualify, not turn up the blasted pool. - I wasn't thinking. - Well, pop your brain into gear and think about tonight and the final. - Mr. Jack? The committee would like to see you. - Ah, and did the committee say why? - Mr. Upjohn will tell you why. - Maggie Benton tonight? All five quids worth over? - Hello, sir. - How's the exciting world of the press? - Well, up and down. - I might have something for you. - I'll be glad when tonight's over. - Me too. - Miss Archer. Interview, the post. Any comment? - What? - On your midnight escapades at the pool with the manager. - What? - Well, I mean that's how the committee heard it. - Your mother. - Alex! Alex! - Mr. Jack, the rules are quite clear. Any behavior that brings association into disrepute will not be ... - All I did last night was go for a swim. I know it was too late, but I needed to relax. The poor manager just watched. He didn't jump in or anything. Oh, why do you always have to believe the worst. I know Mrs. Benton told you. - How we heard doesn't concern you. - And nice Mrs. Benton wouldn't tell lies, would she? - No, she wouldn't. - It was her, wasn't it? Mr. Ap John, I know you don't like me. You never have, but if you don't want me swimming then just bloody well say so. - And you would bloody well say so wouldn't you, Cyril? - Well, we need deliberate no further. Archer is disqualified. All those in favor. - Are you satisfied now? - Was it you that reported Alex? How could you? - Alex! Alex! You can swim. The committee voted against Mr. Ap John. Hey, wait ... Now what are you trying to do? Burn yourself out before the damn race? - It doesn't matter. I didn't sleep last night. I went too fast this morning. Maggie's got too much going for her. Even her mom and Mr. Ap John. - There's always gonna be Mr. Ap John's. That man was born to be a bastard. And Mrs. Benton, why she wants it for herself. Alex, she's scared of you. She's scared of your simple bloody guts. Look, if Maggie was doing ballet and hockey and piano, she wouldn't have got this far. And if she busted her leg, she'd be finished. And if she lost someone like Andy. - I don't want to talk about it. - No. You never have. Come on. I know you loved him and I know that he wanted you to win. I know you can. - No. - Yes, bloody yes. What are you wearing that for? You weren't supposed to have that until you won. - Then you take it. - I'll give it back to you at the end of the race. - Go away. - Alex you can win this. Now I wouldn't say that if I didn't believe it. After everything you're still here. That's not just guts and talent, that's you. You can do it Alex Archer. - Leave me alone. [chattering] - [Voiceover] Would all competitors for the women's 110 yards freestyle please assemble behind the starting blocks. Your race begins in two minutes. - No sign of her. - Thanks. - Swim like a fish my dear. - Good luck, darling. I know you'll win. - Maggie will have a great deal to thank you for. - You rat bird. - Any sign of Alex Archer? - No. - [Voiceover] There's been a slight delay here for the start of the women's 110 yards free style. - We'll rejoin you again in a moment. Until then we'll cross back to our main studio. We could announce the result right now. - Yeah, it's a one horse race. - [Voiceover] Final race of the evening. The women's 110 yards free style.

She's made up ground. - [Voiceover] I have a chance now, Andy. - You got a chance, you got a chance. - This is an incredible race. A strong challenge from Archer, but Benton is still holding. - She's holding. - [Voiceover] Closer, she's still ahead. I can't do it. - Archer's left it too late. This is Maggie Benton's race. - Alex! - [Voiceover] Andy. I couldn't admit you were gone. Wherever you are I'll try. [intense music] - Yes. - And it's Archer! [cheering and applause] [crying] - [Voiceover] In first place, Alex Archer and a new national record time of 66.2 and in second place Margaret Benton. In third, Stacy Long. - We did it. - You did it.
