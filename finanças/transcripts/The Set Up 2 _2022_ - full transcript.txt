Where is he trying to go? I'm so sorry. I'm coming back now. - Hmm. Thank you. - You're welcome. Enjoy it. Let's go. You want some? No. That thing is gross now. Why do you eat this nonsense? Same reason you keep doing this to yourself. - I can't help it. - Chike! How's she? - It will help to talk to her. - Chike. Wait please. Chike. Won't you say hello? - At least meet Pelumi. - There's no point. Don't shut me out! Excuse me. Hello. Wait. Chike! Chike please. Chike, wait. You do have plans of reconnecting with them when your sentence is done in two years, right? Cause without the protection of the US Government, I'm as good as dead if I step foot in Nigeria. Ahn-ahn! It's not that bad. The Nigerian government considers me a traitor for working for the Americans. Traitor? Nah. They just think you're very badly behaved. I know you're tapping Grace's phone. And her husband's phone and the Nanny's phone, just… waiting for my return. Uh, well I don't think we're on the Nanny. I mean, Grace changes them every six months. I mean, like three nannies in six months. Since I can't be with my sister, I might as well do what I'm good at. Oh, she's just hyping herself. You're not that good oh. Uh, hmm. We're just managing you in this Nigeria. - Shut up. - Get away! That will be that. This is as far as we can go. What the hell?! Chike, I thought you said it was 100 meters from shore. So, can we go closer? No, we can't. It was supposed to be overcast. It's not. There's too much visibility. They will see. It's not your fault. I should make you swim it. No problem. You just man the boat and take the comms and I will. You were a lot more fun on your last visit. Hm? Clear. Ahn-ahn! Chike wait for me now. Ah! Why is this one showing her teeth? Remember, it's a simple extraction. Get Mayowa Kuku out of the party. The head of security has put Obiora down as a guard but he can't get you in or out. Here we go! I'm freezing! I'm freezing here! I don't blame you now. Hey you! What are you people doing down there? What's taking so long? Chike oh, I'm freezing. Hey, at least it fits. Why do you have a sarong on? Mind your business. If you need to get this guy's attention, you'd need to show some more skin. Don't you think? He looks bored… He looks good. Um, the boss wants to see her. Madam! I've been told to show you the time of your life. And by who? Emeka? Or is it Fredrico? Or Tayo? It must be Tayo. No, it can't be Tayo. Tayo knows I like bigger breasts. Works for me. Enjoy. Wait. You must be a dominatrix, aren't you? Then it is Fredrico. He's the only one I told. What I am, you can't possibly imagine. I can imagine a lot of things, my darling. Me? You? Uh-huh! So, where are we going? - One thing you learn… - Uh-huh? Never question me. Oh my God! I love Fredrico! Take me! Yes. Take me anywhere you wish to take me. Em, guy, how has it been? Captain is calling you. I'll be here. Usi, listen to me. I've told you, I will attend to you tomorrow. We need a distraction now. Okay? Don't take my hospitality for granted. Alright? But of course. I just thought to tell you that the woman you're with is a US Government Agent, here to arrest you. Wait, what the hell... - That's right. - Ooh! - Squeal for me, daddy. - Get her out of water. Okay, come. It's true what they say. You're quite resourceful. Who the hell are you? Oh, do you have the time for that? See you around, Chike. Say hello to Madame for me the next time you see her. Who the hell was that? I don't know. - Why did she let us go? - I don't care. These guards will soon start coming. Put this over him, let's go. Hurry! Let's drag him back so we can go and change. C'mon. Rashidat, we have him. - Go! - We're heading… We're heading to you now. I ain't saying shit. Listen, okay? You ain't got nothing. Nothing! Hmm? Okay. Shit! Looks like I have everything. What kind of arms dealer is dumb enough to enable facial recognition? They're gonna kill me, okay? They'll kill me. Maybe. Maybe not. But the only choice you have is to help us take down their network. How do I know you'll succeed? You don't. But what other choice do you have? He'll cooperate. Mayowa Kuku, you're under arrest for arms trafficking. Shit! How can you even say that to me? - I'm not the bad guy here. - Oh, yeah. Chike is part of you. If I hate her, I hate you. But yes, I'm happy that she's not part of our lives anymore. And I'm also grateful for the things that she did for you, for us. That's the truth. I don't want to talk about this. Baby, come on now. I just don't wanna talk about it. Okay, Pelumi, tell mommy that daddy didn't mean to say that. Pelumi, tell Daddy that Mommy accepts. What? Baby. Grace. I thought I saw some… I saw something. - What did you see? - Just hold her. - Hold her and wait. - Just hold her. Just wait. Nkoyo. Shit. What's wrong? A lady is knocked out in our backyard… Nkoyo. She's one of Madame's Red Arms. Why would they come after you after all this time? I don't know. Let's just hope that whatever they want, it is just with me. Please stay here. Please. Can't even think. - Blood of Jesus. - Stay here. Yeah. What are you waiting for? Let's get this over with! Omada. Grace. Whatever Madame wants, just leave my family out of it. Let's go inside. Blood of Jesus. Grace! I've heard a lot about you. My name is Usi and I'm sorry. Don't talk to me as if you know me. What do you want? You! Go upstairs, pack a bag for you and the baby. - Madam? - You have to be mad! You have to be mad! Grace stop. There's nothing you can do… You are not taking my daughter. We asked you to pack your bags, right? Let's have the baby. Come on now. Please. Oh! Oh, my God. Please. Please you can't do this. Please don't do this! Here! Give it to Chike. Tell her to turn it on. I don't even know how to reach her. I'm going to tell what all of you are doing. Madame is not going to get away with this. Are you done? Ladies, let's go. No, I'm sorry. Wait, please. Oh, please. - Babe. - Please. Chairman, move. Please, move! - Hey! - Guy, move! Guy, move quick now. They're late. There they are. One arms dealer, as requested. Hm. Hey! Congrats on a successful mission. Shows how much we can get done when America and Nigeria work together. Right, director Teju? Why do you look like you stole Wizkid's clothes? I'm pretending to be an American, here to discover afrobeats. As you wish. Obiora, let's go. Senior Special Agent Agwu will remain to brief me on the mission. Yes, Director. You may wait for him by his car. If you leave, I will have you arrested. You are in this country on my sufferance and my patience is growing thin. Obiora, I'm by your car. You need to do better than Agent Spencer. Keep your bitch on a leash. You may go, Agent Davies. Always a pleasure, Teju. I expected better… from you. Things went a little out of my control. There was only little I could do. Oh, excuses? I'm sorry ma. Hm. Leave the bottle. Chike. What do you want, Eugene? We agreed that I had a month off. A month in Germany? You should be thanking me. Besides, you want this. No, I don't. Thank you. Ultor's terrorist group released a new video. People of Africa, arms dealer, Mayowa Kuku has finally been picked up by the Department of Security. Whilst this is a welcome development, this is not a cause for celebration. Looks like there's a leak in the Department of Security. Teju thinks the leak is you. Of course she does. She wants you arrested. So why isn't she arresting me? Grace's daughter was kidnapped… by a group led by a tall woman with purple hair. Teju thinks that she's Ultor's top lieutenant. You're not in jail because you're now Ultor's top priority. This case involves the kidnapping of a Nigerian national. You've got to be kidding me. They already have Grace and her husband in a safe house. What could you do that they can't? You should see your face right now. Yes, you're on the case. Thank you. As a consultant. The Nigerians are running point on this. Fine. Listen… Ultor is your priority. Not Grace's daughter. - Okay. Mm-hmm. - Find her, but bring him in. Fine. Obiora is waiting for you outside. I'm sticking my neck out for you. - Don't cut it off. - Wouldn't dream of it. Didn't I tell you there was something odd about that woman? Thank you. Don't thank me. Just listen to me when next I talk. Okay. No thank you. Ahn-ahn! Violence now? You're just lucky I won't let you do this case alone. Or you mean you need a vacation because I'm going to do all the work as per usual. Standard. But I also want to see how you cry when you find Pelumi finally. You'll cry, right? - Juicy tears like... - Shut up! How old are you? I don't know. Look, Eugene says that you have her in a safe house, can you take me there? As your lord pleases. Okay, men first, despite. Wonders! Hey! You think they'll try again? Can't be too careful. Give me credit. See the nice house now. In the heart of Lekki. Please give me a break. In the name of my Lord, Jesus. What are you doing here? Get out! All that matters is getting Pelumi back. Don't you dare say her name! You're the reason why she's missing. I didn't do this. Didn't you spy on Grace and Pelumi? If you didn't expose them, wouldn't she still be here? You did this. It's been hard on him… on us. Grace. No. No. I'm not going to let her do this to us. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'm so sorry It's okay. Why are they after you? I don't know but we'll get Pelumi back. I swear. Don't worry, he's on our side. So, can he let us talk alone in private? - By all means, shoot. - Unpack. Alright. Please come. Omada was with her. Nkoyo too. - Red Arms. - Hmm. What does Madame have to do with Ultor? Ultor? The Anarchist? What does he have to do with any of this? The tall lady with purple hair is his top lieutenant. She interrupted my last mission. I just don't know what her connection to Madame is. Usi. That's her name. This girl… She kicked my ass like it was nothing. I've never seen anyone move like that. What's that? She says I should give this to you. - Addresses and locations? - Hmm. Different place and time depending… She wasn't sure when you'd show up. Tonight's meet is at the lounge. So, how do you plan to play this? I do what she wants… It's Pelumi. Keep moving. This is stupid. People are watching. Karate class, guys! You should join. Follow me. You're not putting a bag over my head, so I don't know where I'm going? Have you ever wondered how your life would have turned out if Madame didn't choose you? I don't have to wonder. Ah yes, of course. You'd have been in jail for drug trafficking… a waste. What would you have been if Madame didn't choose you? I mean, that's what all this is about right? You are a former Red Arm. Shouldn't you be taking your issues out on her? You're funny. I didn't expect that. I hope you're still laughing when I kill you. That drive contains information about a man called Igwe Macintosh. He provides banking services for the people trying to avoid the banking system. Good for him. You will go to his office and you'll bring me every single content in his safe. Do that and Pelumi is all yours. So whoring for Madame wasn't enough, so you decided to choose terrorism? What does Ultor want with this Igwe Macintosh? Send a message when you're done. You can't rob Macintosh! What other choice do we have? I have to get my daughter back. You don't understand. Politicians, drug lords, terrorists, name it. They all save their money with him. Ultor targets people like this all the time in their crusade. Why do they need me to do it? Someone sounds like she admires Ultor. Admire is a bit of a strong word, but think about it, everyone he targets has it coming, as do the politicians who protect them. If you know who Macintosh is, why haven't you gone after him? Like I said, politicians leave their money with him. He's protected. Not any more, he's not. The Department of Security, they have a file on Igwe Macintosh. Usi's USB drive. That's what's on it. And you won't believe who knows him. - Thank you. - Who's the owner of this place? I have a proposition for him. - Not interested. - Because you have so much going on. Are you done? Just getting started. Really? Mm-hmm. - You really want to do this? - Sure, I do. - Really? - Yeah. I just want to talk to you. I have nothing to say to you. I have a job that will pay you 50 million. Do I look like I need your fucking money? Clearly, this place is a shithole. Always the hard way. Hundred million. You're fucking crazy. Hundred million or no deal. Fine… No deal. Um, 75. Thirty upfront. We have a deal. That wasn't so hard. Shoo! If you cross me, I'm going to kill you slowly. Why do you keep making threats you can't carry out? All I need is an intro. Macintosh only cares about people that are useful to him. Your little adventure with the US government placed me in the black book of most governments globally. I can't launder money for him any more. So I'm not useful to him. Well, let him be the judge of that. After all, we're going to try anyway and if we get caught, we'll be sure to let him know that you helped. You enjoyed that a little too much. Yes. Yes, I did. Knock out his teeth. Burst his eyes. Mezie, deal with him. Good evening. Thank you. How did you get tickets again? Pound him. Knock out his teeth. The only reason this place exists is because Macintosh saw it in a movie. I told you we'd make it in. Still doesn't guarantee that we're getting Macintosh to act. Yeah, let me get that. Thank you. Cut off his head. Show them you're a champion boy! Mr. Macintosh. The men from the Department of Security are here. Bring them? Beat him to a stupor. Mezie, The Bone. Hail him nonstop. Hail him nonstop. Alright. Two hundred thousand on me, ehn? I brought you bad news. When you said you were coming, I thought it was a man that was coming. Because you say Chike and Obiora. It's male names you mentioned. Did your father want a male child? Did your father want a boy… but instead you crept out. And your dad? How may I help you? The Department of Security has enlisted the aid of the US Government to take you down. You are lying. Consider this a gift. Your security file printed out just for you. Now my number is on the back. When you're ready to talk, call me. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four… Is this your grand plan? You're useless. - Three, two... - Wait. Igwe wants you to come to his office and wait. Oh man, I am so busy tonight, combing my hair. Now I told him to call me when he's ready to meet. So let him "call". Don't mind her. You know she's Americana. I will speak with her. We're coming. Hey, take your cheap bend-down boutique suit out of here. You pay me and my team one million dollars and we let you know when the raid is gonna happen. One million dollars that I just picked on the floor? - Get out of here quickly. - We're giving you a chance to flee. Surely you have stashes outside Nigeria. Aren't you the one in charge of the investigation? Alright, kill it. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed. Well, we can make that happen. - Ur… - That exposes us. For one million dollars? I mean, it's worth it, isn't it? It is not. Listen to your friend. Listen to your partner. He's wise. Only if you pay now. I'm sure you have it in your safe. Are you sure you don't have testicles, this child? - I have. - Ooh! Yes. Oh-oh-oh! These millennials, they don't know anything. Look at what this small girl is saying, keeps running her mouth. See the small mouth on her body. Hey! What the fuck?! What's going on? - Hey! - What are you doing? - Chike, we need to be fast! - You people are dead! - Hey! - This should go smooth. You don't know what you're doing. - What are you doing? - I got a gun! Edem! Let's go, let's go! I'm almost there. Almost there. There's a reason people call me Macintosh. Wait for a moment, get your hands off me… Igwe Macintosh is the one you guys are… Edem! Are you crazy! Do you know what you just did? Calm down! Go, go go, go, go! That was so risky, man. We made it, guys. Is everyone okay? There's a meeting option at five. We get Pelumi back today. I'm getting off here. I'm not part of this madness. I'm getting off here. You don't have to go alone. You don't know what to expect. They asked me to come alone. What does it matter? You already have what they want. I'll see you soon. You pick the best places. I can't wait to see where we go next. Who's going to look for us at a garbage dump? I have what you want. Omada? It's here. The other thing? What's this? A bitcoin thumb drive with 200 coins worth over $5m. The private key is in there. Make sure you don't lose it. Omada will take you to Pelumi. Wait, what do you mean... What the fuck is this? Consider this as payment for helping us to take down Macintosh. I didn't help you do shit! You should join us, you're wasting your time working for the government. I know you, I know what you've done. You're on the wrong side. I'm not on the side of people that kidnap little children. I'm going to find you and I'm going to make you pay for that. Pelumi is waiting. Chike, we should go. Macintosh is looking everywhere for you. I dropped the tracker in the van as requested. Leave me out of what comes next. Thank you, Edem. I believe I've honored my end of the bargain. We'll talk when I have Usi. Usi? I thought we were after Ultor? My baby. I'm so sorry. Just look at her, it's ok now. It's okay. What is this? Five million dollars. If you can believe Usi. Wait a minute, Chike, you didn't check? I don't want anything from her. Ah, five million dollars. Really? Let's go meet Aunty Chike. Come on, come. Meet your Aunty. Hi. Shall we? - Yes. - Yes. Shit. Give me a minute, I'll just talk to them. What do we do now? There's nothing we can do. Um, they're here to arrest you… for letting Usi go. Just you. Grace you can go. Dimeji has been released from the safe house. I don't regret any of it. Yeah. Why didn't you do what you were supposed to do? I think you're just useless. Do you know you failed in your line of duty? Answer me! What the fuck is going on? You know you can't be questioning my agent right?… Man, get the fuck out. That means you too, chum. Grace got a better safe house. You were supposed to prioritize finding Ultor. Pelumi was my focus and you should be happy that I took down Igwe Macintosh. I mean, he has to be worth as much as Ultor. Igwe Macintosh is a Department of Security Undercover Operative. Of course one of the worst people in Africa is a DOS Agent. Of course. You allowed a terrorist to use you to damage one of the DOS's best assets. Do you know that he was gonna put a price on your head. So what changed? They want you to bring them Usi and Ultor. Yeah. Sucks for them. Teju's words. Or they will use Usi's play book. Grace will be declared as an unfit mother and they'll take Pelumi from her. They're threatening a child. How are you okay with any of this? Grace's daughter will be fine. Give them what they want. I know you can. It's fine. Good luck. And if you need help, talk to Edem. I'll pay for everything. Let's go… I always knew you were a traitor. But this, a decade of work all wasted? Do you know how much was done via Macintosh? How many lives we saved? All of that up in smoke… How can I expect you to understand? You are a common criminal like your father and a whore like your mother. And yet… I'm still the only one who can help you get Ultor. If you like, don't get him. You would really threaten Grace and her family? I will do anything, to keep my country safe. Now get out. You're welcome. You have a family. After what happened to Pelumi… I should have called you. Ooh! Why are you so quick to sacrifice yourself? I'm my father's daughter. I'm not supposed to die of old age. Why do you act as if your life doesn't matter? It matters to me. You don't get to throw it away. No, you don't. Stop. Just so you know, if you die, I'm going to kill you. Same goes for you. So where do we start? Ahn-ahn! - Mommy calm down now. - Shut up. So all these my good deeds now, ehn… you're not going to appreciate it. Really? Hey! Give me some credit. So, where are we going to? To see the one person who knows too much. Ebony. Prisoner K-2334. You have a visitor. Who is Usi? Why did she rob Igwe Macintosh? Ooh. Get me out of here and I'll tell you all you need to know. Tell me all I need to know, and I'll get you out of here. You know what you need to do. Hello? We need Macintosh's help. Brave man! Everyone, hail me! Hail me! Macintosh! Macintosh! Igwe, deal with him! I heard you were looking for me. I need your help. You're raving mad. I need to break Madame out of prison. I know you can help me. Come on, you know you want to. Man's name. - Mezie! - Yes, Boss. Show her something. Teach her a lesson. Yes, Boss. What? Survive the round. Three minutes. And I will help you. Mezie, Mezie! Hero! That's my champion boy! This is insane. I've been in worse jams. He's going to kill you. I'm just going to wish he was dead. Well, hey, I might just win. Stop pissing him off! I'm being nothing but nice to him. Get her, Mezie. C'mon, Mezie! What's he waiting for? It's all games. How many more minutes? - Two minutes. - Oh, my God! Ah! Mezie, do you know it's a woman beating you up this way? Were you listening to anything I was saying? - I'm too busy getting my ass kicked! - Where's she from? You're going to pay for that. Chike! What exactly do you want? Macintosh said you can get us into Madame's prison. Say, hypothetically that I can, why would I do it? I can't believe you work for the US Government. So do you, my darling. The DOS hates me. Now imagine what they would do to you… Teju, especially. Okay. I'll do it. I'll get you there. Now get the fuck off my premises before I unleash the dogs. I supply the prison phones, drugs, alcohol, the usual contraband through an unused sewage tunnel. That's your way in. You'll disguise as guards. Go through the central courtyard and make your way to Madame in the storage section of the prison. Are you coming with us? Nah, I'll find my way. Grace, it's good to see you. We're not playing your games. Chike, we don't have this time. We need to know why Usi scares her. When I found USi she was a club girl. But I saw something in her. Something magical. I took her under my wing. I taught her how to dress, to fight. When I was done she could hold her own with the clients. And was the best operative I ever had. She was my right hand. The iron fist in my velvet glove. So how did you betray her? A Senator was worried that his son was being blackmailed. Usi did her job as usual. The boy confided in her. Turns out, the idiot boy and his friends raped a few university girls. The Senator cleaned up his son's mess, burned down the girl's hostel. Unfortunately, he decided Usi was part of that mess. Usi defeated his thugs. But her sister, Omani, was killed. She wanted to go after the Senator for revenge. But nah, mm-mm, I couldn't allow it. Usi was out for blood. I taught her well. First, she took her mother to safety. Then, she killed the Senator, his son… the two idiots who attacked her. Every one involved, she killed. So how come you're still alive? Because two women stole a laptop containing the whereabouts of Usi's mother. Extracted her from her house by telling her she was being interviewed for winning the lottery… Usi couldn't kill me because I held her mother hostage. Our first two missions. Indeed. And you were very good. That's why you didn't turn us over to the Americans immediately. You needed us to capture Usi's mother. Macintosh held my asset ledger. That's all Usi wanted. And I'm sure by now she has her mother. And now, she is coming for me. That's fine. And to do that, she'd have to go through me. You'll have to kill her to stop her. That's the thing, you're too soft. That's why she'll always win. You are not ruthless enough. Let's go. Grace… It's good to see you. Bitch. Enitan… So good to see you again. You haven't earned the right to call me that. Thank you so much for this gift, Chike. I've dreamt of this my whole life. All your bullshit about fighting for the greater good and it boils down to petty revenge? How are you any different from the people you claim to fight? Even I am human. Ultor does not begrudge me my revenge. You're not taking her anywhere. I have a sniper trained on you. I knew you'd be watching the prison. I knew you couldn't resist. Is that so? You're going to come with me and you're going to do it quietly. You think you're the only one who knows a sniper? I know two. And one of them just killed your sniper. What are we going to do? Unfortunately, they revealed their position. Listen to me, Chike. You will never be better at this than me. I already paid you. Take your bitcoin. Take Grace, her whole family and disappear. You're free. - I'm going to find you. - No, you won't. We can't let her get away. - You're mistaken this time. - Grace! Grace! Grace, stay with me. Stay with me. Grace, stay with me. Grace! Grace, stay with me. Stay with me. Grace! For what it's worth, I am sorry. I am going to find you and I'm going to fucking kill you! Even if you do, I'll probably deserve it. Right? Grace! Edem! Grace. Edem! Edem, recruit! Grace. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay. Grace stay with me. - Let's go, Edem! - I'm trying. I'm going to kill her and you're going to help me. Of course. I will make them pay. Trust me. I don't want you to murder in her name. I don't need your permission. You're not God. You can't control everything. You just have to accept this. Go tell that to your daughter. I will. When she is old enough, I will tell her that her mom couldn't watch injustice happen and that's why we loved each other. Yeah, you do that. I'll be busy bringing her killers to justice. Don't use my wife's name… Don't use my wife's name as an excuse. Her memory deserves better. Be well, Chike Chike, if we must do this, we need some time to re-strategise, right? It seems you got your friend killed. You came to check if you still have a hold on me? Don't worry, I'm more motivated than ever. - Are you? - Usi is mine. You can have Ultor. What are you going to do with her? Kill her. Slowly. You'll get no argument from me. Keep me updated. No surprises. Yes, Director. I am really sorry about your loss. I'm not leaving. I know. Look, this has a feed from a satellite tracking Usi's convoy. You gave us Ultor. You did it. Eugene. Three days, that's all I can do before I circulate it. Thank you. What did he want? Nothing. Are you sure you don't want to… - I think you should... - Once she's dead. - Take a moment. - Once Usi is dead. So what's in Benin? Usi and probably Ultor. How do you know this? Doesn't matter. I don't understand. Why aren't we involving the Department of Security? I like assassinations. Okay. I think we should just hold on. How about we try capturing her? You should say no. All of you should. So she wants you to invade a fixed position manned by the continent's most hardened terrorists on foreign soil. I say you're all dead. - Hmm. - I'm in. I need you to get us into the US safe house in Benin. And you have nothing I need. No, I don't. But I need your help. Please. Seeing that you're all miserable… okay. I'll do it. Okay, I think that's their car. Is Usi in the car? I don't think so. They are definitely interfering with our system. Omada and Nkoyo. Wait a minute… Are they heading to us? - Shit. - We are too close for comfort. - Should I leave? - No, it's too late. Chike, you're fucked. There's no version of this world in which you win. Honestly, the only reason you're alive is because we feel bad about Grace. You better kill me now, if not I will take this place down. Let's go. - Fuck! - Ahn-ahn, calm down now. I'm not leaving. Of course, you're too stupid to leave. Too stupid to cut your losses. Wow… thanks for the pep talk. Then again, that's why you win all the time. You go further than most reasonable people. There's no winning here. Grace is dead and that's on me. All I have is revenge. You know, Grace died because she lost her cool. That will cost any professional their life. It's not on you. You have to let that go. If I've learnt anything it's that revenge is not served angry. But then again, you're right. There's no winning here, either way. Yes. So what's the point? Why can't I let it go? If I had an answer to that one, I wouldn't be standing here. I'm not sure I want to live in a world where… I like you. Hmm. Really? That should be my line. Guy, I can't risk your life for my crusade. Usi thinks she has all the cards, I can use it to my advantage. Ahn-ahn, is that a Customs uniform you have on? You're raving mad! Look, if I can't fight my way in, maybe I can sneak in. If I could just... Em, there's no just, Chike. The only way we can succeed if we go unnoticed. - Oh, come on. - Mm. - You and who? - Mm-hmm. - Obiora… Obiora. - You and who? Are you people trying to kill me? Don't you want to die? - We're here! - Thanks for this. Once you're down. Trigger the EMP device. It will knock out power from the building. They're down. What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? - Really? C'mon now, I'm ready. Tranqs only. We are here for Usi alone… Don't kill anyone. Chike, slow down! This girl is going to get herself killed. I won't try to stop you. Who are you? Who are you? Hey. I'm about to enter into what Rashidat says is the situation room. Chike, wait for us now. Chike! Chike. You're late. I left the door open so we could talk… I told Omada that you'd find a way. Forgive me if I can't stand. I can't take steroids when I'm on chemo. So I tire easily. Did you get my story out of Madame? There's a part she didn't know. In the Roman Empire, there was the concept of Vindex and Ultor. Protection and Vengeance. Teju was always poetic. You and Macintosh are the same. You both work for Teju? I will do anything to keep my country safe. She created a terrorist? I was to be her Ultor, Private Vengeance against the world of criminals. I decided to carry on with the mission. Private vengeance against the world, for real. Then I got sick… Been thinking about who can carry on my mission. When they killed my sister, I wanted revenge on everyone who wronged me. I have to hope that my successor is better than me. That he would rise above Ultor and be the true Vindex. I am not your successor… I said, shut up! No! She's still alive? Why? We're taking her into custody. Teju can squeeze her dry. Pity. I really wish you'd killed her. What the hell does that mean? Unlike Macintosh, I was a secret even in the organisation. Teju doesn't want her past to come haunt her, and that's what your friend, Obiora, is here to make sure of. - You were my friend. - I still am. Teju is a Patriot. I cannot allow all the good she's done for this country be undone by this woman. I'm not going to allow it. You couldn't kill her. Why do you think you can kill me? Please. Don't do this. Chike, I have to. I'm sorry. How can you serve a country that asks this of you? It's for the greater good. Country first, no matter what. I'm glad I didn't do it. We're definitely coming for you. We have to. He talks too fucking much. But he's right though. They will come for you. So why aren't you? Don't. Don't. You look like shit. Clement, so good to see you took my advice and got the face tattoo… My people will be in touch, Chike. I don't want anything to do with you, your people or your mission. Do you think she will take it? I hope so. Otherwise, you'll have to. Sorry. Sorry. Usi baby. Usi baby. Should I kill him? No, I don't think she'd like that. Are you sure? I'm sure. I just took out three Agents for you. You're welcome. Don't act like you didn't enjoy it. And the others? They're not coming. Usi? I did what needed to be done. That's my girl. I'm so sorry. I wish… I could have killed her. I'm so sorry. I hope you can forgive me. - Chike. - Don't! You have a nerve to show your face here. Chike. Chike, I need you… The world doesn't like women like us. Women who do not fit into what is expected. Chike, we find women like Madame who abuse us, who use us. And then if we are lucky we find people like you who keep us safe. People who protect us. People who do the right thing, no matter what. The age of Ultor has passed. We need Vindex. We need you. Grace would have understood. She would have wanted this for you. She's dead. So you'll never know. Grace would have understood. She would have wanted this for you. I will tell her that her mom couldn't watch injustice happen and that's why we loved each other. Come on, Chike, is this the life you want to live? Ultor fought and died for what they believed in, an Africa for Africans. An Africa where the governments were truly for the people, by the people. As Vindex we will continue their mission. I need backup. Ah! Oh! And we will fight to make their dreams a reality. And to those of you who oppress us, and those who enable it, you have nowhere to hide. We will come for you. You will pay. We will get justice. I have an offer for you. You are going to help me find and kill Chike Ekeh. With all pleasure. But can you trust her? Do you know this woman? No, Director. Subtitle translation by: Regina Njoku
