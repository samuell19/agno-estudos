- Inside her? - Yeah. That's not physically possible, mate. That's what she's saying. - How much? - Half a kilo. That's a lot of gear, mate. That's like that, innit? Like the size of a mango or something! There's no way she could fit that in her pussy. No way! Look, she said she's gonna bring half a kilo back. What do I care where she puts it? Because it's your money, Frank! You gotta know what she's doing with it! Maybe she's planning on putting some of it up her ass. Will you stop banging on about it? - What? - Only 'cause you wanna get it on with her. And now she's planning on bringing all this gear over from Amsterdam, you're getting, well, I don't know, fixated. - I'm not getting fixated! - Yes, you are! Do you think she struggles to satisfy herself, sexually, I mean? You know, pussy the size of a bucket, some guys would find it hard! Maybe she only fucks guys with really big dicks. See, that's what I'm thinking. So if I can just work out a way for her to find out about what I got, - I could well be in. - Who is it? It's Frank. Guys, this is Mandy. Mandy, feign indifference - towards the guys, please. - Hello, Mandy! You boys want a drink or something? - No, I'm good, thanks. - Yeah, why not? Thanks, man. So what have you two tomcats been up to? - Prowling around? - This and that. What about you, Fitz? You throwing a party or something? You know me, Frank, all work and no play. It's a lot of gear. - Yeah, it's my birthday. - Happy birthday, Fitz. Thank you, Tony. Cor, that tastes like trouble. What's the matter, Frank, so I'm buying a lot of gear. You should be happy. Valuable customer. Just wondering where my invite was, that's all. You don't need an invite, Frank, you're always welcome. So, two ounces, that's 3,200, yeah? I'll just go and consult with the bank of Fitz. That's gonna be some party, right? You gonna be there? Bet you are. I bet you love it, you and your mates. You're Frank, aren't you? - That's right, yeah. - You're cute. You're dogged out of your mind. How much gear have you two been doing? Tons. Tell you what, we gotta come to this party. - Where you going? - I'm going to take a shower. Take a shower. Sounds like the start of a fucking porn film. She's a very beautiful woman, Fitz. - Where'd you meet her? - Fuck you! She's not a prostitute. And, fuck you, don't eye rape my fucking girlfriend next time, yeah! Listen, Frank, I've only got three grand on me. Do it for that, yeah? It's 3,200 for two ounces, like I said. Yeah, but I've only got three in the house. So what are you saying? Well, got a bit of wiggle room? How about you just pay me the money? Come on, Frank. Three thousand. Let's go. It's possible, yeah, but wouldn't it be easier - to swallow it or something? - So are you saying you wouldn't do it, - or that you couldn't do it? - I'm not a drug smuggler, Tony. I mean, if they catch you, you get ten years! But if you had to, what if you had to do it? Well, I wouldn't swallow it. What if it burst? I'd probably shove it up my ass. - You see, proof! - That's not proof! A lady can't fit that much gak up her cunt! - Don't use that word. - All right, - what am I supposed to say? - I don't know! - Pussy. - Pussy's better. - I like cats. They're slinky. - OK. So if she's planning on putting half a kilo of coke up her... ...pussy, by my reckoning, Frank's well within his rights to check if this is possible, right? - You're fucking crazy. - He's fixated! I'm not fucking fixated! It's just... You're in for how much? - Eighteen. - Eighteen grand. That is a lot of money, Frank. He just wants to be sure. - So when's she going then? - First thing tomorrow. Did you hear about Ronnie-Rae's friend, Luca? - Got raided. - Yeah? Say she could go down for a couple of years. Yeah, well Ronnie-Rae's a fucking lunatic. I was wondering, can you stretch to an extra 50 a week? - It's risky, Frank. - Yeah. No problem. You coming home later? I don't know. I'm still really rough from last night. Tiredness is something we can work around though, right? I'll see how I feel later. Danaka? Danaka. She's outside? Right, all set? Just need the money, then I'm on my way. Tony. Oh. Hi, Tony. I didn't see you back there. Cheers. - What time do you get in? - Thursday. Fly first thing tomorrow morning, pick up the gear, train to Brussels, then on the Eurostar first thing Thursday morning. - Are you gonna pick me up? - Maybe. Fuck it, I gotta ask her. - Oi. - Can I ask you a question? Well, it depends what it is. Do you really think you can fit it all in? Are you seriously asking what I think you're asking? Yeah. Tell you what, you show me yours... ...and I show you mine. - For real? - Mmm-hmm. Come on, Tony, what have you got to be scared of? Oh, I'm not scared. Whatever the opposite of scared is, that's me. What? What, it's cold! Oi, leave it out, oi! Oi! - Frank! Oi! - Ah, that is brilliant! See you later, boys. - What? - Get in! Fuck off! Come on! Aah! Whoo! Whoo! Hey, I'm sorry about the mess. He's got a problem with my mate. He did it last week as well. Are we cool? # Higher # # Higher # Whoo! # Higher, higher # Fuck! Fuck! Can't believe she fucked that Chinese guy. - What was his name? - Fuck knows. Some girls just go for Orientals. It's like a fetish or something. No, the bloke she was with in the club wasn't Oriental. Yeah, well, he's a fucking pussy, him and his crew. See that roundhouse kick I give him, Bruce Lee style? - Yeah. Turned a few heads. - Fuck off. What's his name, northern bloke. He was there last night, he asked after ya! Dunno who you're talking about. Yeah, you do. You were inside with him! Marvin or Melvin or something. No. Yeah, well, said he's gonna give you a call. Said he was looking to score. Big time player. Gave him your number. What? Since when did you start handing out my number? - You know him, though! - How come I don't remember him? I dunno. 'Cause your brain's fucking sludge! Dunno what you're so pissed off about. Should be charging you commission or something. Fuck. Fuck! Who did this, you fucking shitbags? Come here, little bastards! Frank, leave it! Get back here, you little fucking... Truthfully, Frank, it was a pretty shit car, mate! But it was your car, and someone's raped it! Shut the fuck up! - All right? - Yeah, I'm all right. You? Put it this way, my luck's gotta change sometime soon. - Thanks. - See you 'round. - Hello? - Who's this? You rang me, mate. Who are you? You just rang my number. Frank. Frank, it's me, Marlon. Your mate give me your number. Sorry, mate, I don't know any Marlons. Marlon Burroughs! I was in Pentonville same time as ya. Come on, Frank, you can't have forgotten! The Marlonator! Oh, sure, sure. Yeah, Marlon. How's it going? - You all right, Frank? - Marlon. How's it going, man? Good to see ya. What are we doing meeting here, you fucking weirdo? You used to be a mate of Greek Paul's, right? Yeah. Greek Paul, yeah. A good bloke, but a bit of a cunt, though. Thought he was God's gift at pool. I must have taken a couple of hundred quid off him when I was inside. Listen, mate, Tony said you were in business, and... - Tony said that? - Yeah. - You know Tony, gobby twat. - What did he say? He said you might be able to hook me up with some Cadbury's. No, mate. Sorry, I don't do that anymore. - What, really? - Gave it all up. Well, do you know anyone who could hook me up? - I need to get hold of a box. - A key? Well, I can pay up to 45 a gram. You got cash? Come on, mate, I'm not a cunt. Let me look into it. I'll give you a call in a couple of hours, yeah? - All right, guys? - Hey, Frankie, my friend! - Huh? - Hey, Frank, how are you? I'm good, yeah. I mean, some kids fucked up my car, but otherwise I'm good. Some kids fucked up your car? - Yeah. - Too bad, Frankie. - You know who did it? - Nah. Ah, that's too bad, eh? Remember when you used to drive this piece of shit convertible? Yeah. Come, come, come, come, come here. Here is something to cheer you up. - Ah. - This you can taste. Baklava. I made this myself. - You made this yourself? - Yes, Frank. Taste it. Come on, taste it. Come on. Huh? Taste it, Frank. Come on. Huh? Good? - Good, huh? - Ooh! - Really good. Wow! - Ah! Shall I teach you, eh? You can learn that, it's easy. Pastry, butter, nuts. Pastry, butter, nuts. Can we talk? Can we talk? Yeah. To make the syrup, take some sugar, lot of sugar. Boil up with some water and lemon juice, and pour it over! Easy peasy! Easy peasy lemon squeezy! - Eh? - That's good. Serefe! - Eh? - OK, so we talk. There's this bloke, you don't know him, I was inside with him. He wants to buy a key of coke... tomorrow. Tomorrow. That's a little fast. - What's the hurry? - Don't know. And how will it happen? Well, I'll pick the gear up here tomorrow, do the deal, - come back with the money. - Frankie, you already owe me three grand. You're my friend, but you owe me money, and money's not here is the problem. You understand? I have a problem, three grand. Well, this way you'll get the three grand quicker. I gave you this three grand on credit. You said you'd be back with this money when it was sold, and now money's not here. That's OK, we are friends, yeah, la-la-la-la-la? And now you want to borrow a key. - That's a lot. - Yeah, it's a lot, but it's a good deal. He's all right. OK, the dope is here tomorrow, 12 o'clock. And, Frank, you promise. I'm a boomerang, I come straight back. I'm serious! Straight afterwards you are here with money. - Yeah. - Yeah. OK, 45 for gram. - Forty. - Forty-five. - When do I see the three grand? - Just as soon as I'm... Tomorrow. Yeah. All right? Ah, that's Robbie. He's proper. OK, you can have it for 50 quid a gram. That's 50 grand. We said 45. All right, let's say 47, yeah? Fifty. It's quality stuff. All right, 50. I wanna try some now. Right. - Here. - Cheers. - OK? - Yeah, it's OK. - Tomorrow at two. - Two o'clock sharp. Listen, any chance we can meet somewhere a bit more central? - Where do you wanna meet? - Dunno, Stokey? - Do you know the car wash? - Yeah. Two-thirty. - Frankie, my friend. - Hey. - Twelve o'clock. - Twelve o'clock. Good! - All right? - Hey, Frank, how's it going? This is my cousin, Meten. Meten, this is Frank. Frank. - Hey, you want some of this? - Hmm? - Want some of this? - Nah, it's too fucking sweet. - Sugar's good for you. - He made me eat some yesterday. Thanks. Take it easy. - Frankie! - Yeah? Shall see you soon, huh? Yeah, around 3:30, four o'clock. Oh, yeah. Whoo! - That's good. - Yeah, it's good, innit? - What are you cutting it with? - It's normal. - I'm just asking. - Babylax! Baby magic! Everyone does it! Now you've seen it get done! - OK. - All right. Let's go! - See ya. - All right. All right, Maurice? Looking sharp. - Oh, Frank. Nice to see you. - Yeah, you too. All right? Hello. Whoo! Frankie boy! Does Flo ever bring her work home? Not anymore. I saw a guy leaving once. I followed him. He walked down onto the canal, you know? He stops, he's having a piss up against the wall. I walk up behind him and I say, "That's the ugliest looking dick I've ever seen." - What did he say? - Nothing. He just kinda looked at me. He couldn't do anything 'cause he was still taking a piss. Grabbed him by the neck, smashed him off the fucking wall, he went down, did a few Fred Astaire moves on him. Should have kicked him properly, roundhouse style! - Oh, there weren't room. - Right, watch this, right. - The circle kick. Stand still. - If you hit me... Yah! Shit! Fuck! - Ah, fuck! Ah! - Come on! Come on, we haven't got time for this. - It really hurts. - Let me have a look. Leave it. I'll do it, all right? I can't see anything with your shoe on. Be more gentle then! Fucking hell! All right! Sit still. Sit still. Ah, it hurts like fuck. It's all right, you've just twisted it. - Is it all right? - Yeah, it's fine. They're here. - Come on then. - I ain't moving! - Eh? - I'm incapacitated! Jesus Christ. Give me the gear. - You all right, Frank? - Where are we going? Do it on the hop. It's safer. - You got the gear? - You got the money? - You all right, mate? - What do you mean? You just seem a little agitated. Well, you wanna know how I feel? I just wanna see the gear. Sure, let's see the money first. Frank, mate, you always get the gear out first. Yeah, well you might do it that way up north, mate, but down here it's the money first. Look, don't be a cunt. The price I'm paying I wanna see the gear! Fuck, dibble! Move! Sit down. - You want a cup of tea? - Yeah. Thanks. - Managed to warm up a bit? - Yeah. You look tired, Frank. Well, my room wasn't exactly comfortable. Listen, you little prick, you're in big, fucking trouble. - Is that right? - Come on, Frank, - we got you fair and square. - How come you ain't charged me? - We wanna hear it from you. - How much was there? Half a kilo? More? Don't know what you're talking about. Must be pretty scary being you right now, Frank. Somewhere out there someone's missing that dope, and they're not gonna stop looking for you until they find you. And when they find you... well... Maybe he needs a little bit of time to think about it. Unless there's anything you wanna say? Who's your source, Frank? Who do you buy from? Still got nothing to say? How you gonna pay them back? A small-time dealer like you? No way you've got that much, no way. Tell us who they are, we'll protect you. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. We've got a signed statement from Tony Cartwright. Picked him up same time as you. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, Tony does. Tony seems to know a lot, Frank, especially about you. We know everything, Frank. Talk to us. It's for your own good. We all know, as soon as you walk through those doors, you're completely fucked. Tell us, who supplied the dope? It's all here. We just wanna hear it from you. If it's all there why don't you charge me? You've got no friends out there, Frank. Don't you get it? You're on your own. # Lord knows it's hard to keep on moving # # You gotta stay up on your feet, now, now # # Lord knows it's hard # # On the road... # Fuck. - Fuck! - What did you say? What did you fucking say? I didn't say nothing! - You're a fucking twat! - You set the whole thing up! No, Frank, I didn't say anything. They didn't catch me! Frank, I got away... Fuck! - Leave it out, Frank! - What did you say? What did you fucking say? # If you want to get ahead # # You have to use your head # Milo. I'm sorry. Fuck, I'm sorry. Frankie, what a surprise! I'm so sorry I didn't show up yesterday. - I'm sorry. - We had a deal. - Yeah. - What was it? I was gonna come straight back with the money. Hakan, can you remember if we had an appointment yesterday? Frank, you're like my son for me, you know? - Yeah. - Come with me. Sit down. So what happened, Frank? I don't have the dope... and I don't have the money. You don't have the dope, and you don't have the money. - Why? - The police got me. You were busted. Eh, Frankie was busted with whole kilo of dope, huh! And you're not in jail or, how it's called, solitary? - Strange. - It's in the lake. - All the dope's in the lake. - What is it doing in the lake? I put it there. I had to. - Kilo of dope in the lake? - I know. It's fucked! Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, think about those ducks. Lucky ducks or flying fishes or something like that, huh? No, no, no, tell me story. Tell me something else here, huh? There isn't anything else. Tell me, were you busted or not? Come on, I told you I was busted. - So what's the number? - What number? The reference number. Every time crime is committed cops give it number. - So they can look it up. - Yeah. They didn't give me one. I mean, they didn't charge me! And you expect me to believe that? - It's the truth, Milo, I swear. - Frank, you owe me 55,000. It's not 55. It's 45, plus the three from before, that's... 48. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It was 48, now is 55. You want to know why, huh? - Ask me. Ask me. - Why? For the bullshit story you brought me! That's what it's for! And you can see it keeps getting bigger and bigger more bullshit I hear! Forty-eight plus seven, 55! - Where is the money? - I'll get it. - All of them? - Sure. - Now? - Well, I can get you some of it now. I can get you... 20, no problem, straightaway. OK, OK. Hakan can go with you. No, there's something I've gotta do first, then I'll come straight back with the 20. - Is it bullshit, Frank? - No, I just gotta pick it up. OK, OK! OK, and the rest? A couple of days. I've got a batch coming in from the Dam. Once I've shifted that, I'll have it. OK. Now 20, then 35, huh? Listen to me, Marlon, you fucking cunt. Whatever happened back there had nothing to do with me. The way I see it, you've got my money, right? I haven't got anything of yours. So you're gonna give me that money back, and if you don't I'm gonna track you down, wherever you are, and I'm gonna take it back off you. This is Danaka. I'm not here, so say something nice, and if I like it I'll call you back. Danaka, it's Frank. Listen, I didn't make it to the station, but give us a call, 'cause I tell you what, I really need to meet up soon-ish. Frank, you all right? You want a drink? I'll get you a drink. You gonna be all right? You'll be able to get the money? Yeah, it's not the money that's the problem. It's the time, you know what I mean? Sure. Milo wants me to give you a hand. I'll be all right. Honestly. I know what people can be like. Sometimes when you come to collect, they'll do anything not to pay, you know? Anything. There was this guy, fucked Milo over six grand. Been there a few times to ask for the money nicely. In the end, I had to go out there with a knife. - It was bad. - What happened, in the end? He paid. He had the money all along. Only now he walks with a limp. I mean, how stupid is that, huh? Frank! She knew it was you before you come in, didn't you, Bessie? All right, Jack. Listen, I need the money you owe me. Yeah. All right, Frank. All in good time. Do you want a cup of tea first? - I can't stay long. - Everything all right? I just need the money. Yeah, well, I ain't got it, Frank. - You know that, don't you? - When can you get it? I dunno. You must be able to get a hold of it somehow. Come on. Frank, I tell you what, look here you are. Here, mate, look. There's, well, 20 quid there. You must have more than this. Come on. What else do you spend it on? Dope, Frank, I spend it on dope. Listen, Jack, I'm coming back here tomorrow, and I want the money. - Look, Frank... - All of it. - I can't, mate. - All of it. - Frank! Frank! - It's 1,400. - Are you serious? - Get a loan. - Frank... - Remortgage this place, I don't care. - Come back, Frank. - Just do it. - Talk to me, mate. Frank! - Just do it! This is Danaka. - I tried calling you. - I've been busy. What, you want me to get it now? Yeah, all of it. Listen, my car's fucked. Is it all right if I borrow yours for a couple of days? Sure. Only I left it round Brian's the other night after that karaoke. And, remember, it's not technically mine - so be careful with it, OK? - Is this it? It's 5,000. No, there's gotta be more than that. There isn't, Frank. I write it all down. - You do what? - Here. It's written like noughts and crosses. Each cross is a 1,000 pounds, and then when you take money out I put a line through it like the game's over. - Did you speak to Danaka yet? - No. Why, have you? She put a picture of Tony's dick on her page. Did she say if she's back yet? Dunno. Didn't she call you? - Would I be asking if she had? - Jesus, Frank! Frank, is everything all right? Yeah. It's fine. See you later. # The sunlight hurts my eyes # I've got a bunch of gear coming in from Amsterdam. - I need to shift it. - All right. Step into my office. Are you interested or not? I'm always interested, Frank. I'll give you 30 for half a key. - Ah, fuck! - Mate, that's properly rank. - Tell you what, though... - Ah, Jesus. The way to fix it is to put it in a bowl of rice. - What the fuck for? - Dries it out. Absorbs the moisture. Here, do you know anyone who wants to buy a piece? - Are you serious? Jesus! - Fucking serious, mate. Automatics, semi-automatics, I got all sorts. - No, mate. - All right, call me when you got it, yeah? # I look to no one # # I hope for nothing # # My mind's wide open # # That's why I'm free # # I search for something # # That isn't there # # I look for looking # # I take no care # # So pull me under # # Pull me under... # - All right, Frank? - All right. All right? All right, Frank, what the fuck happened? - What? - You and Tony. It was nothing. May I borrow your phone? He's in hospital! Say they might have to put a pin in his jaw. Well, maybe that'll teach him to keep his mouth shut. Here. Come on, Frank, what the fuck happened? We fell out! Friends fall out! - You fell out with Paula. - Paula's not in intensive care! This is Danaka. I'm... Do you wanna go to this party? Is it gonna be any good? Yeah. It's V VIP. We're on the list. Hey, Milo, it's me. Frank. Yeah, I know, my phone's fucked. I'm not trying to fuck you about, I don't have it yet. Yeah, sure, however you wanna play it. Tell him to meet me tomorrow, we can do it then. OK? - What's wrong? What is it? - Nothing. Who was that bloke you were talking to? - No one. - What did he say? - You really wanna know? - Yeah. He offered me a 100 quid to suck his dick. He thought I was a whore! - Aren't you? - No, I'm not, Frank. All right, I'm working as a dancer right now, and sometimes I do a bit of escorting, but that is not the same as being a whore. Frank, where is the money? All right, Tony? - How you feeling? - Shit... Listen, you're probably thinking that I've come round here to apologize. But I haven't. I need that 800 you owe me. Six fifty. - We'll call it quits, yeah? - Fuck off. Now fuck off. Hey, Frank! Who's this? - I've been trying to call you. - Good. Does that mean you've got the money? Frank, mate, I can get it for you, all of it, by the end of the month. I need it now. The end of the month's too late. Frank, please! Please, Frank! - Look, calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. This guy is gonna rip your kneecaps out if you don't pay up. Here, look... That's worth a few bob. What am I supposed to do with that? It's not my money anymore, you understand? I can't help you. Here, Frank, please, for fuck's sake! You're a fucking insect, you know that? - Huh? - Look, hang on, shut up! Shut up, wait, wait, wait! I've gotta say something! Look, look, I know a bloke who can get the money. Too late for that. It's my money, I want it now. Can you get it now, right now, yes or no? - No. - Wrong answer. Come on, I'm not going to shoot you. What's the point in that? I want my money. You're going to rob a bank. - He can't rob a bank. - Anyone can rob a bank. Look at him. He can't rob a bank. He's fine. Which bank do you wanna do, huh? I don't know. - We'll hit the first one we see. Come on! Time to go. Can I, can I have a... Can I have a line? Yeah. When you give me the money. - No. - Yeah, let him have one now. - No. - Give him that. He gets shit 'til it's done. Milo wants his money. Come on, let's go. Listen, we don't need to do this. This is... So what happens now? We need to get rid of this shotgun. It's got both our prints on it. What are you gonna tell Milo? I'll tell him what happened. But you should go see him. Give him what you got, anything else you can get hold of. Seriously, Frank, all he wants is his money. Something's better than nothing, yeah? Yeah, sure. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - This is Danaka. - Fuck's sake! Milo, it's me. Frank. Hey, Frankie, where are you? We had an agreement. Did Hakan tell you what happened? Yeah, he told me what happened. But that was an unforeseen circumstance. - I haven't got the money. - Come by now. Bring me what you get, and we can talk about it. I'll come by tomorrow. By tomorrow, lunchtime, I should have it all, all of it. Listen, Frankie, I like you, but if you don't come round tomorrow, you won't be able to walk again, you understand? Hey, Frank. - What you watching? - Dunno. Some sort of program. Are you all right? Yeah. What's that? Is that for me? Open it. I'm sorry... for last night. - You want me to try it on? - No. Don't. Flo, no, I'm not rea... That's enough. That's enough. I wanna say thank you. Don't. I said that's enough! Danaka, where the fuck are ya? - ...cafe. Do you know of it? - Yeah! - Well, it's by the... - Yes, I know where that is! You fucking wait there, just wait! I'm on my way! - I'm gonna be there in... - Or I could get on the tube and come... - No! No, you... stay... - You sure? Surely... Danaka, listen to me, stay where you are! I'm on my way! So what's all this meeting in public places, huh? - You look like shit. - Yeah, thanks, Frank. You don't look so good yourself. So have you got the gear? Here. Half a kilo as discussed. - What's this? - What the fuck do you think it is? - It's cut to fuck. What is it? - Well, I haven't touched it! That's fucking lemonade. That is sugar. - You're taking the piss. - Fuck you, Frank! I went to the address, like you said! I picked it up, like you said! - Where the fuck is it? - That's it! - I promise you. - Did you check it? - Yeah! - Did you check it? Yeah. Yeah, I mean... I think, I think I did. They might have switched the bags. Frank. Listen, Frank, I'm sorry. If there's... It was Bob you met, yeah, the Dutch guy, Dutch... Yeah, Dutch Bob. I was there, he gave me the stuff and then... Hey, Frank, we've been looking for you. - Who's this? - This is Danaka. You just been in Europe? - Good trip? - Yeah. Well, it was nice seeing you and everything, Danaka, but I should probably talk to these guys for a bit. OK. So where you been, Frank? I couldn't pay him back at the time. - And now you can? - Mmm-hmm. You wanna give the shit to me now? She travelled back from Amsterdam with half a kilo of dextrose up her ass. You think this is funny? You got two hours, Frank. In two hours' time you'd better have 35 grand... ...or you won't have any fucking kneecaps. Do you understand? - Hello, Mum. - Hello. Come in. - How are you? - I'm fine. What are you up to these days? Different things, you know. - You hungry? - No. - Sure? Get you a sandwich. - No, I'm all right. Have you got any money? I've gotta get a hold of some money today. - What for? - I owe it to someone. - How much? - Thirty-five grand. Thirty-five thousand pounds?! If they don't get it today, they're gonna kill me. - Can't you get the police? - You have it? These people, can't you talk to them? They don't wanna talk, they just want their money. I've got about 300 pounds in cash in the house, and... 2,500 in my savings account. - I'm going out. - OK. I was thinking, maybe we should go away together some time. I don't know, for a weekend or something. - On holiday? - Yeah. See you later. What? - Where's the gear? - What? - Where's the gear? - What? I gave it to you! That wasn't it! I want my gear! - Where is it? - I told you what happened! Where have you been then? Why didn't you answer the phone? - What? - Tell me! - What? - She was with me! - No. - Who the fuck are you? No! No, Frank, he's got nothing to do with this! Frank, leave him! Stop! He's got nothing to do with this, Frank! - Do you know where my gear is? - Frank, stop! - Do you know where my gear is? - It's in Amsterdam! - Where's my gear? - It's in Amsterdam. Frank! It never left! He ripped us off! - It's in Amsterdam? - Yeah, in Amsterdam. Please! Please! So you thought you could take my money. Did you think you can fucking rip me off? I'm coming over there to fuck... To do what, Frank? That money doesn't exist anymore. And this time tomorrow neither will you. What else have you got? Three hundred for the .32, 450 for the nine-mil. - You got bullets as well? - Fifty quid a pack. I'll take 'em both. And the cash. # All the anger's lost # # Freed from the beat and the pulse # # Laughing like a fool # # Playing for the heart and the soul # # And the soul # # Capture something red # # Paste it to the edge of your bed # - You come. - Where's Fitz? Is he inside? Take me to Fitz now. # Someone who will know what it says # # What it says # # Feel it break # - You're cute. - Where is he? I think you should have a line before you see him. - Come on, he's not in here. - You seem tense, Frank. I like that about you. - It's like you're not scared of anyone. - No. You don't know what you're talking about. Oh, but I do. I know what it's like, Frank. Sometimes it feels like you're on a train, and you wanna get off. Don't you wanna get off, Frank? # Nothing's lost Keep going # # Feel it break # # Feel it break # Go on, Frank. Fucking banging! It's back. Listen to this. Oi, go on. Frankie! All right, mate, how you doing? What's with the fucking guns, Frankie? Making me go soft, man! Happy birthday, Fitz. The safe, now.
