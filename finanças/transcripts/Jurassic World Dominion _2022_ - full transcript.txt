Dinosaurs are in our world and in every confrontation, we learn more about this frightening reality. How did we get here? It's been three decades since the deadly events of Jurassic Park and we've yet to find a way for these animals to live safely among us. After the devastating eruption of Isla Nublar's long dormant volcano, those who survived were transported to the mainland. Many of the larger predators were captured. But the remaining creatures scattered here in Big Rock National Park. While most remained in the wild, those who made their way to civilizations struggled to adapt to unfamiliar conditions. Look the boys have warned the animals are unpredictable and when Hungary extremely violent. As the dinosaurs spread across borders, a global black market has risen. To combat the growing threat of illegal poachers, the US Congress awards sole collection rights to the global giant, Biosom Genetics. At Biosin, we're dedicated to the idea that dinosaurs can teach us more about ourselves. CEO Louis Dodson has created a sanctuary in Italy's Dolomite Mountains where he hopes to study the dinosaur's ancient immune systems for unique pharmaceutical properties. While Biosin believes we can handle genetic power responsibly. The public remains skeptical. Some note that these government contracts have led to massive spikes in Biosin's profits. And rumors persist of a human clone who mysteriously disappeared leading to a worldwide search. Some believe she's genetically identical to Charlotte Lockwood, deceased daughter of Jurassic Park co-founder Benjamin Lockwood. Now we brought these animals back from extinction, can we face the consequences? Are we responsible for them or should they be left to fend for themselves? As we adapt to an ever-changing world, we must find answers to these questions for their safety as well as for our own. We are headed inside the illegal breeding facility. The juveniles are kept in cages to keep cost out. It's medieval. Clap Why do you think he separated from the rest? I don't think he's going to make it. Two, What are you doing? We're going to report this. The DFW takes days to investigate. We can save this one now. Nope. Nope. Jump. We're going to get shot. Protection. Everybody good? Okay, so I think we get this one to the DFW and then we hit them again. Yeah, you saw that breeding ground, right? We're done. I got a call last week. It's a real job. Something I could do to effectively change things. I gotta take it. They need us. Are you saving these dinosaurs because they need us? Or are you saving them to absolve yourself? Claire. I mean this is crazy. Claire, you're doing the right thing. But this, this is the way to go about it anymore. Honestly, you need someone who's good at being shot at. It's not that weird. You need to be weird. He meant like surprising. Yeah. Okay. You. Yeah. We're going to get you some place safe. Go. Five, four, I Where you been? Noah. What are you burning? Oh nothing just some old blankets. You sure you didn't go pass the bridge? I said it could give you anything underlying. What are you? No. Maisie, you're literally looking everywhere but you. I said I didn't go pass the bridge. I know Claire. There are people out there who do anything to find me. I'm not angry. So that means you don't have to be angry. I'm not angry. I can take care of myself. Hey, it's okay for us to depend on each other. That's what people do. How would I know what people do? The only people I've spoken to in the past four years are you both. Besides, I'm not even I speak from someone else. You were the only you who ever was. What? Who's that? It's like really cool. That's so cool. Can we keep that between us? Compromise. Thank you. Oh. Oh, I like that. Yeah. Okay. Um I'm going to Everything okay? She went into town again. This kid, did you talk to him? I tried. I'll talk to her. Well, Yeah. Two, again. I Amen. Alright. Away from yourself. I would not mess with everything either way. As a kiddo, we should probably talk about you going into I don't think you understand how bad it is being trapped. You're not trapped here. We just don't trust people. No, you just don't trust me and then you expect me to trust you. Why can't I have any freedom? Because you can't. Hi What is happening? She's 14. Yeah. Do you remember what that was like? I do. We can't keep her here forever. If we don't figure this out, she's going to go a lot further from the bridge. They find her when her again. We gotta protect her. That's our job. That's what we're going to do. Protect her how? By locking her inside? She's got questions. You know, questions we can't answer. She wants to know who she is. Who Charlotte Lockwood was. Dragging grading to his house. Raptors got Judah. Listen to something else. I found a girl that went after. Thanks for coming. Wasn't sure who to call. Missing well, I didn't even want to say it if there wasn't a dinosaur. Yeah, well, they get all the attention. You guys want to bury the same place plots 100 yards each? Is this students? Yeah, we've been looking into the impact of industrial farming on the environment. So, this is right up our alley. They hit 60 fields in the county. Is it anything like this before? No, not like this. They've been leaving degraded fields all across the Midwest. First these big companies try to kill off all the insects. Now this. Is that your land? That's the Bennett's garden. The locust didn't mean that. You plant the same seed as the Bennetts? No. We are independent. They use biosin seed. Yeah, I bet they do. You say you caught a live one? Because paleontology is science and science is about the truth and there is truth in these boxes. Red, You're going to want to see this. Alan Grant, you look the same. In this place. So you too. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were coming over to Can I get you something a beer? Um, maybe not at 10 AM but iced tea or. Tea, yeah. Tea, I can do that. Saw a lot of tourists on the way in. All the funding's dried up so somebody's gotta pay for all this. I can't. I read your articles about soil science and regenerative farming. Can't be grounds for some hope for change. How are you kids? Hm. Amazing. Grown. It's shocking. They're both in college. Can you believe that? And Mark, It's over. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. It's okay. I'm back to me, my work. You know, it's. That's great. It's good. It is. I'm alone at last. Exciting times. Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life. It's just. It's going to be lonely. So free. Ally. You didn't come out all this way just to catch up now, did you? Plants of locust, mandibles, wings, thorax but god, the size of it is massive. It has genes that have been extinct since the cretaceous and swarms of them are decimating crops from Iowa to Texas. Terrifying, right? Started as a few hundred. There could be millions by the end of the summer. If they keep going, there will be no grain to feed chickens, cattle, the entire food chain would collapse. I was clearly designed but why would anyone do that? None of the crops they're eating are biosin seed. The biasin. Same biasing made this. I mean, it would not shock me that they want to control the world's food supply. Up or a few million stars. Can't waste that saying three meals away from anarchy. If we don't stop them, you can pick your last three meals. So why are you bringing it to me? I need concrete evidence. Bias is responsible for all this. I need to go to their sanctuary and get DNA from another locust there. But I need a witness. Ellen, you command respect. People believe you. Why I'm here. It's quiet. I'm done with all that. Are you okay? Well, I'm sorry. I mean, nobody gets that luxury anymore. Not even you and you know what? You're the one I trust. This bison sanctuary is what? 1 hundred miles from anywhere? How do you even get in there? I got an invite from their in-house philosopher. Seems there's a lot of money in being a chaotician these days. And he just happened to invite you out of the blue. He said there were things I'd want to see. Uh Every animal captured on the mainland comes through here before shipping out to Bison's sanctuary in the Dolomites. We give them medical attention and make sure they live healthy. So much security. Those are just the ones you see. A lot of shady types out there want these guys. Your plane's just filling up. Bonnie sends a tough invite. You guys must know somebody. Do you mind? Of course. Follow me. We rescued these guys from the legal breeding farm in Nevada a few weeks ago. Shut the whole place down. Not this time. Good girl. You never get used to it. Take care. Thanks. Bye. Yeah. You look just like blue. This? You want to try it? Okay? Whoo. Macy, don't move. Girl. Staying out of trouble. Baby, that's impossible. She won't hurt us, right? Oh, you damn right she will. Just breathe. If you don't, she'll think you're scared. I am scared. She doesn't need to know that. I'm Vanessa's gotta be nearby. Maisie, get inside. I'm coming with you. What did I just say? We gotta move. Not yet. We need the girl. Maisie. Maisie. Okay. Where are you going? You can't keep me here under my mother. She's leaving the house. You. Hey. Greece of Let's go. Who are you? They found her. What? Who are they? Walters. I've seen them around. Leaders are real **** y'all. They must have recognized and followed me here. Where is she? Go get the truck. Hey. No. They took her kid too. I'm going to get her back. I promise you that. And this year man. What's next? Historically darkness, blood, raid of fire, I think frogs. We're not going to be around for much longer anyway. These locusts in Nebraska are about to wrap it up. We basically all of our food and our food's food. So you can say goodbye to this. Franklin, it's me. Okay, you're a bit of a subject of interest around here since I'd be talking to you. Come on, I'm in trouble. I really need your help. Please. Yeah, and I could lose my job and you know I'm not qualified to do anything else. We're outside. Let me talk to him. That's him. Name's Rain Delacourt. Little piece of work. What do you think? Something we care about very much. I told you somebody would come looking for her. You can't just take a person, Claire. I had no choice. Not in the eyes of the law. This guy is not the law. Tell us how to find him. Where'd you guys call me from? We have a minute on the inside of Dela Court's operation. There's an exchange in Malta sometime tomorrow, cash for cargo. There's no mention but we have people on the ground already. One of them you know a lot of us got recruited by the CIA after Very stretchy toe loop stone. I need to talk to him. We can't just call him. He's deep cover. Look, once we make the bus to Malta, our guys will see Delacore knows where she is. Our guys, not you. Promise me you will go in there with your vest and mess everything up. Why would I do that? You guys are both crazy but you seem like you're good parents or whatever you're trying to be. Just lucky to have you. Don't get killed, okay? Think we're almost there. Yeah. Doctor Santler, Doctor Grant, Ramsey Cole, Communications. Oh, thank you. Uh, I have to warn you, everyone's so excited to have you. You guys are absolute legends around here. Hm, you must be confusing us with somebody else. You know, it's great that you guys are still so close to Doctor Malcolm. I mean, sometimes you meet your heroes and they disappoint you but he's exactly the way you'd want him to be. I mean, such fertility of thought, it's incredible. Which time he has found with it? Uh well I know that was sarcastic but honestly not enough. Oh please have to wash your head. So Bison bought this land for the amb deposits back in the 90s, but we've managed to turn into a safe haven for about 20 displaced species. First generation came from Sorna. Most of new bar dinosaurs are here too. Took fish and wildlife three years to catch the T-rex. But the T-rex is here. Oh yeah. Yeah. Just before you guys. Restricted airspace. Protects the airborne life. Keeps the terror source below 5 million feet. Airborne. Dead Broadus. Beautiful, right? Her name means fear nothing. You know that. What did they graze on? Hawthorn and firm. All indigenous. Nothing stocked except for the deer populations. Great mesening species for the apex predator. Holy apex predator. Piganosaurus. At least for now. Um, you don't let people in there. Our our research, our research office are connected completely underground. If we have to, we could just bird the animals remotely using neuro implant that sends electrical signals directly to the brain. Like shocked. Uh no, like like signals. Strike you is a little bit for a little cruel. Do you know how much voltage is in the electric fences at Jurassic Park? Doctor Ian Dominion New from the lecture hall for the ethics of Genetic Ocala. God it must serve the honor. Oh well it is part of our ethos attract the best and brightest. Doctors. Respected. Renowned. Doctor Sattler. Doctor Grant. I'm well this is big. I'm I'm Lewis. Dodson. Yeah. Hi. You're Louis Dutch and how do you do? We didn't expect to actually see you here. Oh well. I wouldn't be anywhere else. I mean the people you see here who are changing the world. Would you mind if we just it would mean a lot. Yeah. One, two, one, Oh, great. Thank you so much. Oh, That's good. That's good fun. So you are going to see some remarkable things today. We are unlocking the true power of the genome or this close we'd be. We could fortune with that. No, it's not about money. No, we've already identified dozens of applications for pamio DNA We will be saving lives. Um anyway, I wish I could take you around myself but it's so you're in more than capable hands with Ramsey. He's basically a young me. Only Do you have food? Like one of my bars? Pardon? Um no never mind. I'll I'll find something. So I want to do more of this later on if we oh we booked you a private pod for the trip out. So it's beautiful. We love it through the caverns and everything. Uh you better hurry. Malcolm's on it. He's a bit of a contrarian but I like him. He keeps us on our toes. Anyway, thank you for being here. It's Okay, follow me please. Human beings have no more right to safety or liberty than any other creature on this planet We not only lack dominion over nature, we're supportive to it. Now, here we are with the opportunity to rewrite life at our fingertips and just like nuclear power. Nobody knew what to expect with genetic engineering but they pressed the button and hoped for the best just like you are doing now. Yep, control the future of our survival on planet Earth. According to you the solution is genetic power. But that same power could devastate the food supply. Create new diseases alter the climate even further. Unforeseen consequences occur. And every time, every single time We all act surprised because deep down, I don't think that any of us actually believe that these dangers are real. In order to instigate revolutionary change, we must Transform human consciousness. Very good. There there you go. Hey, I don't want to be rude about friends. Thank you. Catch me on my way out. Thanks everybody. Look at you. Look at me. Oh, look at you. Wow, this is so trippy. You look like you're doing what? Well, I got five kids. You know, my adore more than life itself. So, expenses added up. You, Allen, are you, are you a yummy family or? No. So I need to talk to you. Yeah I need to talk to you too. Privately. Do you two talk a lot? He slid into my DMs. You know what? It's urgently. What'd you do? 7 minutes to midnight still. Uh the doomsday clock might be about out of time but as they say it's always darkest just before eternal nothingness. What? Locusts altered with credaceous era DNA. Yeah, that's not my field. Yeah, but these things continue to multiply. We're talking about gasoline system wide effects in. Gosh, that's a drag. This dragon matter with you. Fine, is there something special we're going to do? Give it to us not to care. Hey, I I gave my opinion robustly for years as expected to some part even the difference led to our annihilation and the only play now is to take the time we have left and you know, just let go to a squadron. Honestly, Ian, that's **** Can I offer you guys some Joe? Uh Tyler, please, two cappuccinos? I don't want a cappuccino. Trust me, it's real tough that jet lag is going to park you right up. 6 weeks ago. I was not raising my voice. And all my models are pointing toward a global down the stairs. It's about six. That's where they keep the locusts. Hey, this looks so silky. May I touch the spice? You know what it is? Don't talk the wrong tone. This is sustainable bamboo. It is sustainable bamboo spice. You know that. Yeah. I've got cumin. It's very cinnamon. I've got all spice which is not very popular. I've got five spices. I'm from the field. Yeah. There's still milks. Okay. Soy milk. Yes. It just happened. Seven level six, restricted. Louis, you're not listening to me. The Lucas prehistoric DNA has made them stronger than they should be. They're multiplying like crazy and they're not dying. What part of this, don't you understand? Oh, I do understand. This is going to be a global family. Hey, hey, we can't anticipate everything. We need to eradicate the ones we released. What? All of them. No. No. Henry. Like yesterday. We don't want to cause a panic. We want control. There's no such thing. When we're afraid, what do we do? What have we done before? We follow through. We found a girl. She's on roof. Cost me a fortune. What? Waiting you found. Yeah, I found them both. Her and the little Raptor. Blue reproduced to all in Rome. Just like you said. You're so smart, aren't That's why this works. You understand the value of these creatures? You always have. I do too. And we don't stop because of what? Little side project went south. If they trace the locusts back to us, they come from the dinosaurs. All your work, gone. Billions of dollars in assets, gone. Diamonds with noone to mind them. You really think she's the solution? Okay. Everything involved in the girl goes through me, right? Is she alright? She better be. Most valuable intellectual property on the planet. I said I'd call you. They didn't end yet? Second plane is incoming. You said anything about a second plane. We flew them separately. I'm not taking any chances. And we'll need payments before delivery. I didn't like what happened last time. Okay, okay. Just call me when it's done. You said I was going something safe. You are. What you come. It's not a choice. Whoo. 50 grand. Not bad. What's with the girl? Not your problem. I should done a visit. Oh wait. Hi, Claire. I thought you would have chosen a quieter line of work. I tried my caffeine and lasted three weeks. It's hard to look away Delapot was hired by a broker in the underground dinosaur trade. We don't have intel on his cargo. But once they make the exchange, we see what they know about to go. You can listen in. I promise you, you will not make contact. Yeah. There's a big underground market for dinosaurs now. Europe, Middle East, Northern Africa, it all comes Don't look at anyone. Don't talk to anyone. Just try to blame it. Are we live? Yeah. Still flying for Santos and you must need money. What's the to you? I've got Argo. A thousand kilos of dinosaur topalermo. I give you to downstretch. 2000. How much is there? You're American. Did that make us friends? Listen, I just got here. Oh. No. That was not an invitation. Here. Souvenir. Go back to the hotel. You know, throw some bath salts in the bath. This place, not your vibe. Wait. Come here. I know this must feel exotic but if you mess with the wrong person down here, you disappear. You feel me? Good luck, okay? Wait. What is this? I need your help. I don't know you. I'm looking for someone. Don't do that. She is all alone. Please. Dagger die? Yes. Sorry, I can't get involved. I I think I got him. Tap it on the move. That's our endocover agent with him. He's headed on the ground. See him? Yeah, I've got him. Art. It's Bravo one. Primary targeted site. Amen. My people say the Raptor arrived in good condition. You boys didn't come the sun. Come at me next. I do have no job for you. Short hot money is double. Where's the cargo? At Trosa Raptors. Kill who? Whoever they're told. Laser marks the target they attached to the center and stopped it instead. Inescapable. Those idiots make a target sound all wrong. You can't engineer loyalty but to nurture it. 50, 000 to fly them Jurassic. In or out. She's not here. You. Where are we going? Almost there. Fly. One. This is round one. One Oh. Yes. Deus. OK a Amen. We had some trouble. What kind? The parents. Thank you. Can you take care of it? No suffering. I'll do it. Okay, listen. Up. You don't use it on people. Where's my daughter? She wasn't yours to begin with. Tell me. Biasing. They're taking her to bias. Four. Amen. Come on. Come on. Left. Slow and Hold on tight. One, Do you remember how we used to get the Raptors in the truck? Yeah. Yeah. You're up. No. You're the last man to die for. I do die for war. You'll be fine. I never get the time right. Minute. Any minute now. No. No. No. Let's see. Please. OK. Quer o Whats? Luada. Palmas pra Willing to risk your life for people you never met? You want to ask questions or you want to ride? We'll take the ride. So this is our habitat development vile out of exciting discoveries as of late. We've brought back numerous species into purest form and I mean complete untouched genives. Like Morris and Tripodus. What? What about splicing DNA? You know, creating new species. No, Doctor Satlin, we don't do that here. We like to think we're more involved. Okay, it looks like we still have some time left before you arrive. Uh would you guys like to try the facilities yourselves? Oh, Yeah, why not? Great. I'll meet you guys at the Hyperloop Station three in about 30 minutes. Elevators are down this hall, not not those. Those lead you down to the sub levels. Need special clearance to get down there? Okay. 30 minutes. I'm really sorry that it hadn't happened this way. Yep, that's what kidnappers say. Claire should never have hidden you away. You're way too important, Maisie. You took her too. We needed her to help us understand you. Hey, Veda. You okay? Did you say Beta? Is that her name? Genetically identical and that's what they have in common and if you and. Charlotte. What do you know about Charlotte? She died. A long time ago. It broke my grandpa's heart. So he made me No, Maisie. Actually, he didn't. Charlotte made you. I'm so excited for everyone to see what we've been doing here. There's new technology being made, new science like every day almost and it's great to be, it's great to be in the center, center of that. Charlotte lived on site B with all of us till the storm. Loved dinosaurs. Charlotte, be careful. Yeah, I will. She grew up around scientists and eventually, She became one herself. A butterfly flew into my office this morning. They say tiny things have huge impacts and I agree wholeheartedly. She was brilliant. Support my mom. In ways that I'll never be. In the metaphysics of identity, can a replica truly be the original? And if it's possible, lost my pen. Is that me? Yeah. Just like Blue, Charlotte was able to have a child all by herself. She created you with her own DNA. So, I do have a mother. Your grandfather didn't want anyone to know the truth. He was protecting her and you. And we're the same. It were. When you were a baby, Charlotte started to show symptoms of a genetic disorder. That's how she died. She didn't know she had it until after you were born. Do I have it too? No. To change No one on earth has ever known how to do that. She said Charlotte's discovery is a part of you now. Your DNA could change the world. To know how she did it but I just can't replicate her work if I could just study you. And Beta whose DNA was never changed. I could fix a terrible mistake that I've made. What kind of mistake? Restricted. Thanks for coming. I Which left them say? Get the sample and get and off so well, they can swarm at the slightest disturbance. Is that necessary? What did you think was going to happen? I have to take the sample. Need concrete evidence. This is it. Allen, you said there was no time. Hit you, Kenneth. For a second, Jared. There's sound signal in between my open the screen. How does she remain in an asset, Henry, if you're incriminating both of us by showing her classified things on the computer. Jurassic Park for cure disease. She was right. Having filled the gaps in Maisie's genome with altered DNA, she used a pathogen to deliver the repaired sequence to every cell. Here I can repurpose what she did, I could change Melody's DNA, eradicating them in a single generation. Maisy and the baby raptor will provide the missing data. Hey, do you want to get out of here? You. Amazing. Asset containment breach, please remain at your stations. Asset containment breach. Please remain at your stations. Nothing. You're Doctor Ellie Satler and you are a trusted pal. What what are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm Mitty Lockwood. My grandpa, Neutron Hanland. We don't we're not we don't work for bias. I can tell. Yeah, we should go. Okay. In and out. You find your girl and go. Tower, this is N one four one. Request the land for free delivery. Over. Uh N one four one negative. We've been advised you're carrying an authorized passengers over. Copy that tower. Be advised. Shipment is perishable. We need immediate clearance. In order to be over. No. Uh negative. Return to point of origin. Uh you think I need breaking up? Are are you hearing me on your side? Nice try Kayla. They Daniel Bird. Who is this? Is this Denise? You do not want me to stop spelling sneakers Denise. You remember the broad name. Denise, in accounts. Talk to Santos. It's the girl's parents. Shut off the ADS. That's the that's the aerial deterrent system. Why is it blinking? Because dead **** Denise retired. Just turn it off. We gotta get out of this airspace right now. It's going to play, right? Not exactly. Should've stayed there. Okay. Okay. It's cool. We're good. It's gone. We gotta get you off this plate. What? Parachute is going to open automatically. If it doesn't, you pull this lever. Do you understand me? If it doesn't open automatically, you're going to pull this lever here. Seat. Hey, your loader's gotta go get you. Get her mom. Get her only shot. I'll see you again. What's the plan? Three. We need the code. Watch out. This place is such a maze. We were so confused, right? I thought we were straight of loss and you said station three. Do you have a sample? What? What are you talking about? The DNA sample. Do you have it? Bias is responsible for the locust epidemic. Doction's covering it up. You were right. I'm I'm here to help you. Do you have it? This pod will take you straight to the airfield. We have a plane ready to fly. Ian told you about Axon allies? No, I told him. Guys, gotta go. Wait. Thank you. Josh. This Amen. That was my baby. Where'd you learn to fly? Uh Air Force. Legacy on my mama's side. Yeah. I'm So how'd you end up doing this? I was a legit contract pilot for a bit but didn't exactly pay not to be out here sending money home so I had a few contacts for the more lucrative shady show. Honestly, I might be done with this line. What? Is that why you're helping us? I was there when they handed your girl off the bias. Could have said something but I did it. And when I saw a picture It isn't enough to do nothing. Whoo. I Nope. What an **** Hey. Ah. You good? Yep. The joy should see beacon. We'll find her. Really love him, huh? I like red hats too. But can't. Disaster live we were tracking an escaped asset. The guys missed it. Been stolen to the next angle. In there. He's an access key. Aqui. White clearance. One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm hit something in Satner's pocket. And get Ramsey up here too with Where are they now? On the way to New Yearfield. They called the hype loop broad on schedule. How are you? You alright? Not really no. Few years after Hammond died She came to my university to lecture and We became good friends. What was she like? Brilliant, light years ahead of everybody else. She had a conscience. While they were out building theme parks, well, she was determined to prove that genetic power could save lives. That was our experiment. If you wanted a child more than anything, she wanted you to have but she couldn't. And fall away. And I'm never alone. What's happening? It's supposed to be the old apermines. They must have made access to us when they built these tunnels. Hey. I heard the alarm. Everything alright? Yeah. No. No. Listen. We can't handle listen. You're right? Uh good. Doctor Malcolm, you are What? It was such a cushion gig and give your access key to security if you still have it. The hypolepods are shut down at Amber Mike's. What? Wow. This day. Uh which which pod are we are there? Um dinosaurs in our minds? Merit dinosaurs everywhere. I mean, you know, technically birds are dinosaurs genetically speaking. Okay, Louis. Grant Santler in this pub, we need to send a security team out there. Absolutely, Ramsey. Thank you. Uh let's all just stay in our lanes though. We can take care of it. Thank you, doctor. That's it, huh? Nothing else to see here. I'm not sure I admire your tone right now. You need to leave. Yeah, I do. But first, I owe all these folks an apology. I think that by lending my cachet to this joint. I admit it may it seem as if by and wasn't rotten to the core. That's enough, Ian. See, here's how they get it. They give you so many promotions in a short period of time that bludgeons your capacity for critical thinking. Oh my god. So then there are doors that you don't open things that you ignore but mainly he's exploiting your enchantment with these. Is there an actual concern here or you just. You're racing toward the extinction of our species and you don't care. You know exactly what you're doing but you won't stop. You You know, I thought you might be different but you're just like everyone else. You see what you want to see. You imagine unchecked Everest. So, that's what you find. You envision what? An evil onbound Prometheus so that's what I am to you. Prometheus got gored. So will you. You rapacious rat bastard. Ramsey, you helped Doctor Malcolm gather his things? His room and then to the airfield. That's it. Kick. Another source. Giganatosaurus launches no terrestrial carnivore. He booked two apex predators in one valley. Pretty soon there's only going to be one. You. Did you feel that? It's an air crew. Must be another thing I've had. Oh, this is my mimic. Just breathe. Just watch out for bats. Say anything about bats. Well, there's probably no bats. No falling rocks. Dispossibility of toxic gas, dehydration, hypothermia, dispossibilities, nothing for certain. I should have left you everywhere. Why did I bring him into this? You were happy in your element. What? I wasn't happy. Do you guys have kids? What? Uh no, I I do too but no pen. No? No?

Jump swam lane. Trying to stay positive. What do you know? It actually works. Ian, this is busy. I may We got the DNA. You need to get out of this valley. Yeah. Come on. Let's go. I Okay. Grandma. Go on. Yuck. I made I better get inside. Go ahead. Gonna need something heavy, something sharp, or both. He's putting the evidence. Bananas. Thank you. I know. This may seem precarious but No, we're we're tearing. Should we all lead to the left or something? That's very constructive. Thank you, Maisie. Yeah. Stop. Yeah, I never. We're fine. Serious?

We need to bring the animals inside. The regulations are clear that in the event of the Jeffrey. Jump. Just call it. Attention, attention, order. Remote heading system is now active. All living assets on route to emergency containment. Can't get hold of anybody since everything is on fire. Doctor Segler, get some water. Doctor Grant. You are? I'm I'm Owen Grady, big fan. I read your book. Well, book on tape. Owen Grady. Owen Grady, I know who you are. You trade raptors. Yeah. I tried. Yeah. How you doing? You you're a Jurassic World. Jurassic World? Not a fan and Okay. So, we good to find a way out of here? Yep. Let's get it. There's a helicopter out in the main complex. We turn the ADS back on, we go home. Wait, what's an ADS? Aerodyterrant system. You know, for the pterodactyls and **** Keeps them away from the helicopters. Well, how do we turn it back home? Okay, it looks like all the systems run through to the control room which is on the third floor. Yeah. Easy rainbow. Wow or what happens? You just tell them what to do and they they comply or human animal bond based on ritual respect. Had a dog once helped my legs so much. It's a true starter. Ah, Kyle. Hey, good. Here's what I'm thinking. We get started again. You and me. I can get money. Yeah. Money's cheap these days. What what's the matter? Don't look so worried. Just there's opportunity in everything Peach. Even this. You you'll earn that. I've been thinking maybe you take more of the lead now. Okay? You ready I think? What the hell is the matter with you? It was you. You told Malcolm about the program. You you you set this whole thing up. You set me up. I gave you every opportunity I did not have. We have an understanding, Ramsey and you do not break that. I would not break this. I'm not new. It's very bad. This is the same system we used at the park. Great. So we can turn on the the thing and then we all get EDS? What's this? What what's error 99? Not enough power. Gonna break down all available power to see us by the primary system to keep running. We need all that power to reactivate the EDS. So the system's safety features what's going to catch? Cool. Of course. How do we get more power? Uh well we can't but we can't redistribute what we have. We just just need to. Shut down the primary system. Yes exactly. Where is it? Uh next floor up. I'll call you with you. We escaped on him. Where is that? Water shoot you sir. How'd your electric system sub eight? Give me eight minutes I can find her. Wait. Who's this now? Beta. Beneath baby. Velociraptor. What? A baby raptor? And you gave her a name. How about that? I made a promise when you burn home. You made a promise to a dinosaur. You're home with us right? Thanks again. Please. Be on channel five, okay? Run three. Come back. But I always come back. I'll have that chopper hot tint wait for my signal. Evacuation place for a seat. Assets now containment Still get night gears all the time. We hold on to regret and we stay in the past. What matters I guess is is what we do now. Nobody except her be backs. B 4, she's in here. Watch the charge. Come from the sides. And at first we thought They disembow their prey but no, they're smart enough to go straight to the throat. The arteries. It's not supposed at the same time. Okay. We've got you. It's right down that aisle. It's right down that aisle where you are. Why are they scooping into this? You can sprint right for it. Here it is. Okay, so it'll be a yellow button and the grid is six. There's a green button. Do you see a green button? It's not that green button that's formed. Four from the bottom. Fourth one up. Third one down or fourth one up. Same thing. Ian, be specific. She was here. Lights off. I don't know how I could possibly be more specific other than to say that the one you want is marked with E one. E one. Any more? No. No. No. No. No. Eyes on me. I've got a hitter on the side of the neck. Maisie, you're going to hold her focus? Grant I'm trying you later. Sorry girl. I promised your mom I'd get you home. Perfect system. It's rebooting. No, I shouldn't be doing that. We're going to make it work. We're going to figure this out. It's very complex. We don't have guns. Primary system compromised. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Aerial deterrent system active. Victory. Victory. Do you feel good? Power. It's Shh. What's your story? We're dedicated to the idea that dinosaurs can teach us more about ourselves. Alright, Kila. We're good to go. Okay, cutie. Hey. Please, you have to listen to me. You created an ecological disaster and I can fix it. Charlotte Lock would change every cell at Macy's body. It saved her life. If I can understand how Charlotte rewrote Macy's DNA, I can spread change from one locust to the entire swarm before it's too late. It's okay. It's okay. It's what she would've wanted. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Him, not him, not him, it's always him. Every is that a dinosaur on your shoulder? Meet me in the center. Landing here. I'll have a choice, dude. The valley is insane. They're not in the valley anymore. Mom, This isn't about us. Everybody hold on to somebody. Wow. No. At every level. Complete systemic corruption in in the executive lands. Systemic corruption. No, and then and then we crashed into this ice thing, right? I mean, they literally owe me a plane. I need to get this sample better to laugh or I take into my contact at the times. You could come with me. Unless you need to get back to your dig. Ellie? Yeah. I am coming with you. Know. Mark will win it then we'll send you home with your folks. Today marks the first day of testimony from Bios and whistleblower Ramsey Cole. The Senate will also hear from doctors Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm who have been vocal in this debate since the incident at Jurassic Park. I'm trustworthy. Yeah. Not getting used to it. Let's finish this. Yeah. Doctor Henry Wu has found an emergency solution to the ecological crisis. His use of a pathogen to alter the locust DNA has revolutionized modern genetics. He attributed the discovery to another scientist, Charlotte Lockwood, who died nearly 13 years ago. I By human decree, Biosen Valley has been designated a global sanctuary. The animals will live there free, safe from the outside world. Help. Chuck. You. Life on earth has existed for hundreds of millions of years and dinosaurs were only a part of that and we are even smaller part of that. They really put us in perspective. The idea that life on earth existed 65 million years ago. It's humbling. We act like we're alone here but we're not. We're part of a fragile system made up of all living things. If we're going to survive, we'll have to trust each other, depend on each other. Coexist.
