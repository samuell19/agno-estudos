The only other... - Basically, my father was like a surrogate father. You know, he was the guy that Gus figured, "Okay. My own blood father is definitely not somebody I respect, certainly, and not somebody I'm gonna spend any... waste my energy on," and he, I think, kind of transferred his, you know, "Who is my male figure?"

These days especially, take good care of yourself. Think about things you really like or don't like. Wonder why you like them or don't. Talk to your friends about them or make friends that do want to talk about them. Life is full of surprises. Some of them, I know from my experiences, are very bad, but some are wonderful. I can tell you, too, that these years you're living now, 16, 17, are particularly hard years.

Me and Peep went down to San Diego on the same day that day, and he went to his tattoo appointment because it was before mine. Me and Brennan went to the mall, and then we met up with Peep, and as we walked into the dude's house, Peep was literally, like, finishing up his crybaby tat, and we looked at it, and we were like, "Dude, we did not know it was gonna be that big." And it showed me... It was like, he doesn't give a fuck. Like, he knows what he has. He knows where this is going. - I remember kind of laughing, and I was like, "Bro, what is up with the tattoo?" Because at the time, no other young rappers like this had face tattoos. And then he was talking about, like... I swear, just, like, talking about, like, some conflict in Syria or something. - I think it was partly an identification with oppressed people. He, I think, really wanted to make himself an outsider. - I definitely think the planet is very sad. There's people fighting to survive, so live on for them.

Sometimes, you would wake up. You'd go to the living room. You'd see about 10 bodies all laid out, and so you got to get to the kitchen, and you got to step over motherfuckers like this, people you never even heard of before. Everybody just laid out. And then we like, "Peep, what the fuck? Who are these people?" You know, and I was telling him, I'm like, "Why you think you got 30 new best friends like that?" He would always tell me, "Yo, man. Yo, so-and-so said they'll pay for this for me and that for me and yadda-yadda for me," and I was just like... just a matter of time. It was like this. And then the next day, everybody announced they were gone. He said it wasn't for him, so he bounced, and then when he made that decision, that's when everybody followed suit. And it was over with. Schema was over with. - Dear Gus, I hear you had a pretty hard week. I'm sorry, but once you get big, and you're big now, it can get very spooky when you have a really hard fight. It's maybe hardest because even after the dust settles, it's hard to know how to reconnect, what to say, what to think, even to yourself. There are lots of people in the world crappy as it is, and you will learn you cannot trust. You may like them or not. You may work with them or not, but you can't trust them. If you do, they'll betray you. But there are people whom you can trust and whom you can have faith. I know so sure that I'd put my hand in the fire to prove it.

What do you mean he's not answering?" - He was bouncing around a lot. He stayed there in Whittier sometimes, and shortly after that or right around the same time, they got the lofts in Skid Row, which was, I think, Nedarb's place. - We just all came up with the money. Lederrick was selling, like, Magic cards. That's how he used to make money, like, buying and reselling Magic cards and shit, so then I was a dishwasher. He was a Magic card seller, and then Peep was just, like... Oh, I remember the... We were $500 away from getting the spot, so me and Peep, like... He had this song that you can find online called "Mud On My Gucci" or some shit like that. We sold it for, like, 500 bucks, and then we just used that for, like, the rest of the rent, and then we just split that rent, like, five ways, and then we were just living at the lofts together. - It was crammed with artists -- Slug Christ, Tracy, me, Cortex, Peep, Nedarb, Horsehead, you know, all crammed into one spot and, you know, just creating music, man, creating history. - I forget what that means. - Drinking off the table? - You got to, like, get down there. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Exactly. - That's worth a lot of money in 1950. - That's worth, like, 10 bucks. - You can't really spend that all in one place. - Talk in the tip. Talk in the tip. - All right. I'm gonna talk into the tip. - Talk about "Hellboy." - Talk about "Hellboy"? - Yeah, real quick. - Brief moment. - This will drop before the... - All right. I got Kanye on there. - Mm-hmm. That's easy. - Yeah. - Dude, it was, like... There'd be a... There was a couch thing. There was, like, this big-ass couch thing, and, like, three people would sleep on the couch, and then people would just pass out in chairs. Like, it was some crazy shit. - And it was... Yeah, it was just, like, a big warehouse space. Like, we... Like, no one had any rooms, you know? Gus' shit was all in one corner, and Ed's shit was all in one corner, and Tracy had all his shit, you know, in one corner. When I say, "Debauchery," I mean debauchery, like, in the funnest sense of the word. Like, it was just a party. - Water. - And you'd go outside, and it's just, like, Skid Row, like, the purest form of Skid Row, you know, just, like, smells like human shit and human piss, and there's just tents everywhere. - Like, he liked living there, but it was definitely really hard for him because it was, like, there's just one bathroom, a whole bunch of people, and the floors were sticky as shit because of the night before. - ♪ I could be your... ♪ - ♪ Nigga, what the fuck you mean ♪ ♪ I'm dunking on your team ♪ ♪ You sending texts to her ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm sitting next to her ♪ - It definitely is the new punk, and hip-hop has been the new punk ever since the '80s because it had moved away from rock, and punk isn't a type of music. It's an aesthetic. It's a energy. It's a attitude. Everything is kind of being homogenized to be rooted in current trap trends, you know, but then we have what Peep was doing kind of interlaced between this new trap. - ♪ If you're scared ♪ - I apparently got a Wikipedia page. I was looking at my Wikipedia page. The genres was, like, alternative rock, like, R and B, hip-hop, trap, emo, pop punk, so they don't really know what to call me. You know what I mean? - ♪ What you love ♪ - People don't realize actually how hard it is to take an established style of music or styles of music and combine them together and make them be something new, and that's what the greatest stars of the world did. You know, you can talk about Prince, for example, and if he's taking from the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix and Parliament and Funkadelic and others and mixing it together, and it becomes Prince. It's like Lil Peep was a guy who was fascinating to me because he was basically doing the same thing if he was taking Green Day and My Chemical Romance and his favorite trap and hip-hop music and marrying those styles to create something new. You got to kind of be a genius to be able to do that kind of stuff and make it work, and he was. - I mean, I've met people I thought were amazing, and I've had instincts where I'm like, "You're a star.

I want to partner with Peep, and I want to bring you in as manager." When he told us about GBC, it's like, "That's great, but we're focused on you," and that's kind of... There was also tension between GBC and myself because my priority was Gus. When he moved, everybody gravitated towards his place, and his place, people would say all the time, "This is the new loft." 20 % of the time, he might have used his bed. It was, like, always, like... I'd go in. Like, Tracy, Con, Horsehead, everybody was, like... I'd go into his room looking for him, and I was like, "Who the fuck is this?" Like, it's just some random dude. ♪ - He called me, like, the next day like, "Yo, put another sample over that or find another Three Days Grace song," and I was like, "Really? Okay." And I did it.

You all three, your brother, you and your mother have been now through two very stressful years, the collapse and end of her marriage and the collapse and end of the only family your brother and you ever knew. This has to be terribly painful and confusing. Off and on, it makes people frantic, bewildered and furious. It's probably something you cannot talk about with anybody, but my advice is, if you can't talk about it, at least don't deny it or run from it. Ask yourself whom you respect, if anybody, and if there are any such people, write a few words, maybe no more than a short sentence or two, saying to yourself why you respect them, and if you don't respect anything or anybody including me, ask yourself why you don't. Maybe you have good reasons. Maybe you don't. Maybe you don't think you need a reason. Just think about it, not once, but over days. One day, you and I might talk about it.

We weren't being haters to, like, this whole group of friends. Like, you know what I mean? But, like, did me and Makonnen tell him specifically he needed to stop fucking hanging out with everybody he was hanging out with? To kind of take a step back and let this, like, fucking wave get to where it was going?

I let them come in and out. I let them wear my clothes. I buy them food." - When we went to London, sort of him and GBC were kind of having some sort of rift or something, and they were kind of saying, like, a lot of negative things, and he was feeling sad and stuff and about it, and I was like, "A lot of people don't want you to grow without them.
