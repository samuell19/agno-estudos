WHAT WE KNOW (Television) In mythology, the phoenix represents rebirth and that is what Alcira Market 'Falla' has done. In November all illusions were smashed when a fire destroyed the monument... MUM: BRING SOME FOOD FOR DINNER Hey, you. Have you nothing better to do than mess around with that thing all the time? There isn't anyone here. There are some girls. But Vicente is serving them. Why not sweep the floor? You asked me a minute ago. I did it. And last night as well. Pour me a Vaquerito. What a slacker... Carla. What's up? She wanted me to sweep again. Now she wants a drink. -Is it her first? -Yes, as far as I know. Don't worry, I'll take it to her. Sorry. It's okay. Thanks. Music and a drink for the prettiest woman in the bar. Why doesn't she bring it to me? Gran, quit hassling Carla. She's been here a long time and manages just fine. Yes... You're just waiting for me to die. Then you'll all be happy. There she goes again. And who will make paella when that happens? You handsome devil. But you're a randy dog. Croquettes, fried potatoes... -How was your meal? -Great. -I'm glad. Here's the dessert menu. -Perfect. -Let me know when you're ready. -All right. -What are you doing here? -Lunch with the gang. Wanna come? I finish at five. I guess we'll be there later. All right. Okay. Who's going? Martí, Marina, Mireia, Alba... Maybe someone else. -I'll call you when I finish. -Okay. Thanks for telling me. It was on my way. Okay. Otherwise, I would have texted you. -Bye. -Bye. Sorry. Who was that, slacker? -A friend. -A friend? One of those who wants a roll in the hay? A friend... Pour me a Vaquerito, but fill it up. All he wants is to get his leg over. He wants the back door and the front. -Paco, a fideuá. -Coming up! -Table seven. -A friend... I can't grab it. Give me a bit more. -The joint! -Careful! -Careful with the joint. -A toke. The joint, dude! Now what? -Sweet potato omelette. -Okay. -Sweet potato? -Yeah, from my granddad's garden. I make a mean omelette. Sort of sweet. But a potato one, too. I can make... Thick, cold tomato soup. Super Andalusian style. Don't splash me! Víctor! Hiya. -Hi. -Hi. -I'll sit here. -Sure. Thanks. -How's your mum? -Fine. Well, the chemo is tough, but the doctors say she's responding well. Cool, I'm glad. Yeah, that's great. Awesome. So, what else? Víctor, snacks and drinks. Hi, Carla. Did you call me? Yeah, you didn't pick up. I was in the water. Didn't you guys hear it? Nope. It's fine. I walked along the shore, it wasn't hard. -May I? -Sure. Snacks and drinks for you, you don't want to cook. That leaves Martí, Jaume... Isn't your boyfriend coming? Bugger off. Forget it. Are you coming? -Where? -Oh, right. A themed Andalusian party, next Saturday. Like we don't have our own fiestas! Join us. I work till lunchtime. Can't she catch the bus? There's only one a day and it's in the morning. I don't mind going in the afternoon. I'll have to go back to work on the 19th anyway. Don't worry about it. We planned to come for La Cremà. We can go back in the morning. Sure. We'd prefer it if you could come. Of course. Do you know what food you'll bring? I can make arepas. -Delicious! -Yeah, yummy. Perfect. Carla, arepas. You don't mind if I talk in Valencian? I understand almost everything... -Hi, Carla. -Hi. ...but I can hardly say a word. I should get my act together if I want to pass the exam. So, talk as much as you want. Come to my house this week and I'll help you. Okay, I'd love to. Thanks. -What will you bring? -My house. Or isn't that enough? If I'm up for it, I'll make pizza. -Are you coming, Carla? -If you don't mind. I mind a lot, so come. What will you bring? I think I'll make arepas. Don't know what they are, but sounds great. Did you bring some? No. I'd kill for some arepas. Or for any food. Do you want some fried potatoes from the bar? Is there food in that bag? Yeah. Can I have some? Sure, as long as you leave some for my mum's dinner. Martí, dude. You just scoffed a load of pastries. Wow, this is delicious. Never smoked before? Pretty much. That was some toke. Took me ages to learn how to swallow the smoke. Don't you want anymore? That's enough for now, thanks. Where are we going tonight? Anywhere but Lycra. Yes, right. We always go there. I liked Lycra when I went. It's fun. Come with us. Sure, join us. There's sand on these potatoes. On the calamari too. I went to the beach after work. I don't get it. If this was in a closed bag, how come it's full of sand? Martí had a bite to eat. Didn't you tell him it was our dinner? He asked me if he could have some. There's plenty. You're like Vicente's gran. I don't have Alzheimer's yet, but give me time. Come on, Mum. Your aunties called. They send their love and they'll send sweet biscuits, too. Delicious. Is that all you're having? No, I had a bite to eat at work. The cooks are fattening us up. Vicente is nice, isn't he? Well, he's a bit old-fashioned. I like the lad. Your dad was modern, and look what happened. -Won't Vicente be there? -No, stop going on. What's up? Dad! Hiya. Did you cut your finger? I had no plasters. Tell Martí to bring you one down. Okay, yeah... -You look pretty. -The bus is late for a change. Thanks, you do as well. -You too, Víctor. -What? You're looking good. Thanks. You too. Why the face? My parents are breaking my balls. Here's the plaster. Thanks. I'm bloody sick of it. "Take out the rubbish, tidy your room"... I'm going out! I've been studying all week 'cos the lecturer hates me. That Lluís Blat... -He's a bastard. -Take a toke. One day I'll pack my bags and leave. I wear heels when I go out to buy sliced bread and nobody knows it, but they're from a Chinese bazaar All my jewellery's from the thrift shop, but I tell people that it's Swarovski. My makeup is from a discount store, but if you ask, I'll say it's a lie Maybe I don't have a Fiat 500, but I have the keys, so I get away with it. Working class, sweetie? Over my dead body! 'Cos I'm a rich bitch turned poor 'Cos I'm a rich bitch turned poor 'Cos I'm a rich bitch turned poor And I spent it all at bingo 'Cos I'm a rich bitch turned poor 'Cos I'm a rich bitch turned poor 'Cos I'm a rich bitch turned poor And I spent it all at bingo. Thanks for giving me a warm hand on my entrance. There were times I felt transported to a techno rave, or even better: it felt like a barn dance! How long have they been an item? It's not her boyfriend. Marina's boyfriend didn't come. Just as well, he's an idiot. Look, The Full Monty. Hey! Do you need a lift? Staying at my place? Nope, I'd rather sleep at home, I wanna work tomorrow. I'm up for it. What about you, Carla? Yeah, come along. We always sleep it off together. Well... yes, all right. Someone has to ride in the boot. All good back there? Carla? -We're here. -Okay. Thanks. Out we get. -Night-night, babes. -Night-night. It's a bit chilly. Morning. How about a snack? You've got flour. Let's make pizza. Is no one gonna say anything about Andreu? Do you know how much? I just guess it. I'm going to the park for a minute. I feel a bit dizzy. So... -Tastes good. -Tastes good. Tastes delicious. A bit hard. Pass me a potato. With lots of sauce. Thanks. Why don't you go to bed? No, I'm fine here. Shut the doors or creepy-crawlies will come in. Okay. -I'm full. -Fancy another? I could have managed by myself... Sit down. I'll fetch you some water, okay? Martí. Martí. Wake up. Martí. Mar Martí. Victor's dad will see you sprawled out here. -Let's go upstairs, then. -No, not Víctor's dad... -I'm fine. -Are you? No, help me. Come on. -Let's go to the dining room. -No, no. For some potatoes. Up we go. Is it tap water? No. Sure? The tap water here is disgusting! Martí... I've got the heaves again. Yes? Okay. Yes. Slacker! Pour me a pacharán. Remember when we were whores in Alicante? Yes. There you go. I asked you for a Vaquerito. Is that a Vaquerito? Is it? Of course. Sorry. Sorry? You're thinking about that soldier from Alicante. WANT A DRESS FOR THE PARTY? DON'T THINK I'LL BE GOING Checking your mobile at work? Hi. -What are you doing here? -I was running. Your mum told me you started your shift. She's nice. How did Saturday end? When we got up, you'd gone. Fine. I mean... I had a major hangover. I puked a bit on the bus. -And you guys? -Fine. We woke up at lunchtime and Martí made pasta. Marina and Martí left later. Oh, I'm jealous. Why didn't you stay? I had stuff to do. Big time party this weekend, right? I don't know if I'll go to the party. Why? What's wrong? That little slut thinks she's gonna get some action. Who's that, slacker? Sorry. Wait, don't open yet. I'm in my dressing gown. Hurry! Come in. I can come back another day. Or we can leave it. No, no. Come on in, err... Sorry, they put me in a foul mood. -The dining room? -Okay. Would you have a plaster? -The one you gave me is a bit grubby. -Sure. -Where are the plasters? -Again? Can't she buy her own? -They have money problems. -It's not like they're expensive. Here, give her this pack. We have another one. -Where are you going? -To say hello. -Hello, Carla. -Hello. No need for the pack. -Don't worry, we have another one. -Thanks. -How is your mum? -Fine. They ran tests last week and the doctors said she's responding well. Good, I'm glad to hear it. -Any work? -No. -I wait tables at Vicente's bar. -So I heard. But she can't find anything. Good grief. When she's completely cured. Yes, poor thing. How is Vicente's gran? They say she wanders around the bar like an old hen. -She's a cow. -God... She's a bit annoying. I'm not saying she's mean, everyone used to say it. All she cared about was money, always too busy to look after her grandchildren. And now look at her. Can't you have a normal conversation without bitching? No. -E-N. -En. What does it mean? I'll tell you later, but don't tell the teacher. I'm going to help organise the kid's party. Studying hard? We're looking for sayings. Go on. "If my eyes don't fool me, then I must be blind drunk." "Love is like water. It goes in a man's mouth and out his pecker." Write it down. Bye. "Pecker"? I don't get it. Better that way. I reckon I'm going to fail this term. Whatever, I'll get it together next term. Víctor is in the same boat. You'll be in class together. Right. Can't wait for the party on Saturday. Jaume and me have cool costumes. How long have you been together? A year and a half. But we don't talk about it at home. My parents don't know yet. All right, sorry. Well... I like someone too. I know. I mean, it's pretty obvious. I don't blame you. I always try and get off with Víctor. He's like... my platonic love. I'd pounce on him when he walks in the bar. He has that effect. Listen... is Marina into him? She's into all the guys. Don't tell Marina I told you that. See you on Saturday. I don't know if I'll go. Why wouldn't you? I already told you. I knew right from the start. I liked him in the beginning. But when your partner just becomes a burden, you have to move on. I want a guy willing to try out stuff. Wouldn't it be better to be single? To do whatever you want. Isn't it a bit perverse to think I need to be single to do whatever I want? Whatever. You don't mind Andreu coming? -No, no. -No. Here comes Carla. Know something really heavy? She told me why they came to Valencia. Go on. In a programme to protect victims of gender violence. Her father tried to burn down where they worked. -With both of them inside. -Shit. He was sentenced this week. -He'll be in jail for years. -He deserves it. Was her mum's cancer before or after that? After. She didn't want to come, I persuaded her. We should look out for her. -I agree. -Yeah. It was so difficult, I didn't know what to fill the arepas with. So in the end, I decided to make them all. Thing is, I couldn't find black beans. I ran into your mum, she made me buy the beans for paella. We're here. Yes, everything is fine. The house is beautiful. Yes, surrounded by mountains. Listen, call me if anything happens, okay? Love you. When the young ladies go to mass... Thanks. they sprinkle powder on... That's enough. -Thanks. -No worries. And the young ladies powder their faces... -I love the house. -Thanks. You'll be drunk before the party. You don't say? This kind of sausage smells like semen. It's true. You keep mixing until it thickens. -Shall I knead it? -Fair enough. Hey, it's getting thicker. Yes. At first sight, it doesn't look too good. Seriously? You don't either at first sight. How many eggs? -Six. -I said five. Trust me. This is my recipe. Add five next time. Wait and see Carla's costume. She'll look gorgeous. -What about mine? -She'll love it too. They're from my aunt's fancy dress shop, it had to close down. -Gross! -What's up? -You flicked ash in there. -Hey, chill out. So are you and Andreu dating? Well, we'll see. I only broke up with Samuel a week ago. Why? No reason. If you like Víctor, go for it. What about you and him? -I don't want to get in the way. -You're not. We're just friends, that's all. You deserve good things in life. The day I don't see you I have a heavy heart 'Cos I'm gradually fading Like the sun at dusk No more suffering, my love I'm not made of stone Because a stone can crack When it takes many blows So that I forget you They give me palm leaves and a crown I don't want anything more Than just your presence If you forget me They would bury me with palm leaves and the crown Sweetheart I don't love Ducati anymore I only love you If I catch you red-handed Call me a black widow You turned your back on me And now I'm all alone in this farce Trembling, I remember That afternoon you didn't hold my hand You came to lie Like a cheap, mean, cowardly thief You came to cheat on me You never had anything to give me You came for me Saying your love was all for me And I believed you Oh, I believed you I gave you my love And you just gave me lies Why did you look for me If then you just walked away? The nights are a torment I can't find any comfort You gave me life Then you killed me. Okay. Are you ready to order? Your attention, please. Falleras, falleros. Your attention, please. Your attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please! There is a white Ford Fiesta under the fireworks. -Why does it look like an elf? -You what? -And? -What? Did you clean up? Last time I found a joint in the grill. -Didn't you smoke it? -Cheeky thing! Watch it or I'll tell your mum. Eat as much as you want. You're with the president's son and the treasurer. Are you paired up? Are they gonna burn the Falla? It's about time you dated someone. -Get a move on. -Okay? -Would it be Parranda's? -Where is she? Bet she's gone for some fritters. Parranda! Is Parranda around? Could you look for her? To offer up new victories for our common goal All our voices will be as one Come, brothers and sisters Ringing out in factories And in the fields Is the sound of songs of love And hymns of peace Ringing out in factories And in the fields Is the sound of songs of love And hymns of peace Behold the Region that advances in a triumphal march! Hiya. How's it going? -Good. And you? -Good. -Are Marina and Andreu here? -Yeah, well, Marina is. Will Andreu be coming? Marina said she doesn't know if he'll be coming. How was the trip, Marina? Fine. Nothing special. The place was cool, but... Andreu's mates were on a different wavelength. It's always better than having to work. That's true. How's your mum? I haven't asked for ages. She's been a real pain about moving to Argentina. Her sisters live there. Cool. Don't you fancy it? Me? No way. There's nothing in Argentina for me. Aren't there masters there? I don't know. I mean, I guess there are, but I didn't really look. Don't leave. I said I'm not going. So, will you live together? Yes, that's the idea. His parents have offered to put me up. You can stay at my place. Or mine. Thanks. I hope that working in the store and if I get the grant... And if he finds a job... What about you, Martí? I'm doing the master's degree. In Valencia. You're off to Barcelona, right? Cool. I love Barcelona. It's cool. I don't know. Alba is doing my head in. -Why? -She's so unfocussed. You have to make up your mind, know what you want or don't. You have to make your mind up in life. It's so important. Almost everyone lives their life in silent desperation. Your desperation isn't silent. In fact, you're interested in us knowing every detail. Piss off. I won't carry on reading then. Anyone coming to explore? Coming! Go on, I want to hear it. Living together, huh? It's like our generation isn't prepared for monogamy. You know? I don't think it's a generational thing. I guess it works differently for each person. It works for a while, Martí. Then it makes you unhappy. People our age split up with their partners, regret it, then screw around with anyone while crying. That's off topic. No, that's the problem. No one knows how to handle it. The old model can't make us happy. Well, there must be people who are happy. Chiqui and Whopper, for example. No, those two aren't a good example. There are lots of people like them. All right, I'm talking about people like us, not those two. Whatever. I only know the wrong option. Well, that's relative. If that's so, like everything in life. Guess what? Jaume and me are opening up our relationship. Your relationship is more closed than Chiqui's and Whopper's. Yeah, as far as I'm concerned. I can't speak for the other person. Maybe you know something. About the other person. Is something up with Andreu? Wow! If something happened, you can tell us if you want. That question was like a slap in the face. No. Nothing happened. It might have seemed that way because of my dramatic pause, but... God, someone say something. I fancy a drink. -You going? -Yep. -The beers are in the freezer. -Okay. Second drawer. No, don't! It's full of creepy-crawlies. Jesus! What a pain. Going to bed already? I've been getting up at 6am. Never thought about it? Not really. Well, if you ever feel curious, you can try it with me. I think he already knows that. If it happens, you'll be the one I choose. You know what? Jaume can't screw me because I have piles. What a bummer. It that a reason to split up? Jaume won't leave you because of that. He can do it with someone else. Everything okay with Andreu? You guys are a pain. You're acting weird, we're worried about you. We're going through a weird phase, that's all. How so? I don't want to talk about it. All right. I remember the first glow party. How come? They all gradually dropped out, we were the last ones. Right. Talking non-stop, lying on Martí's parent's bed. That night was mega. Do you know something? While you were explaining all that stuff with your parents, all I could think about... What? I don't know... You were lying next to me, just in underpants, whispering in my ear. I felt really horny. And I thought... "Damn, I hope he gets on top and kisses me." I thought about making a move. Tickling you as an excuse to get to your bulge and on top of you. But I didn't dare. I was thirsty. Sure. Take them off. Guys! -Is there room for me? -Sure. -What's with him? -He was like that when I came out. -Oof, he looks so hot. -Martí! Come here. "Oh, Margarita. When she pees, it splashes, when she poos..." "It tears her in two." I had a horrible dream. A baby was on the floor, crying. I had to pick it up to comfort it. But when I tried to hold it, it was like a bar of wet soap. It kept banging into everything in the room. And it wouldn't stop crying. I dreamt that my mum came out partying with us. She was totally wired and wearing a bikini. She began shouting and yelling, shoving me and saying: "Find me a guy!" I was so embarrassed. I pissed myself laughing. What about you, Víctor? Any dreams? Carla. Thanks. Shit! I have to work this weekend. You're kidding? So do we go back on Friday? Not if you want to stay. I don't want to spoil it for you. How will you get back? There's a bus first thing. It does exist, it's not a myth. Society should have done away with work. Sometimes I think about work, but I'd rather be in prison. They feed you and you can study another degree. Ring my dad and ask him what it's like. He'll be glad someone called him. I like it neat and tidy. Not completely hairless. I like it bushy too. I don't mind what other's pubes are like. I mean, I like a bit of stubble. Like this? Don't you see that they're alienating us? Don't you see it? What a racket. I wouldn't mind riding Víctor's joystick. -You stink of rotten beans. -What a bastard! Well, your hair stinks like something burnt. I don't know about burnt, Víctor's paella was... perfect. It was more like a chicken stew! -Hi. -When were you going to phone? Later. I was having a nap. What's up? I found plane tickets for 400 euros, for early October. Sure you don't want to come? No, Mum. Not even for a few weeks? Your aunts will lend us money for the return flight. You know I don't have holidays. All right, okay. Let me know if you change your mind. The prices might not go up. See you in a couple of days. That's pretty obvious. Living abroad is an experience that enriches you. But... I don't know. Jaume and me want to live here when he comes back to Spain. I'm up to my balls. It's so cold they're shrinking. Booze session tonight? When a woman sighs... Like mad for a man... Though she's his girlfriend and adores him, She never kisses him on the mouth Though the boyfriend loves her You always see him sighing -Looking sadder than... sad. -Sad. And yearning to cry out Spice it up for me Spice it up for me That way love will grow For when the things we do for love We do well, they feel better Spice it up for me A lot of spice And a pinch of hot pepper Just wait and see, girl, If you use that spice with care, You'll always be lucky. Well, that's your opinion! This feels so good. Do it this way. I'm going to bed, guys. Already? So soon? Yes. Have fun this weekend. Don't play loud music. The bus stops in front of the bar at eight, right? Yes. Okay. Good night. Hey, Carla. What's up? I'm pissed off because I have to leave. You guys make me feel old. What? Not old, a pain in the arse. Just ignore me. Stay and have fun with the others. I can go with you if you want. I'm saying the exact opposite. Okay. Take it easy. Enjoy yourselves. Carla... Just ignore me. I feel really toxic right now. And I don't want to be. Sure you're okay? Yes. It's just envy. That's all? Like what? -If you want me to go... -Not this again. Good night, Víctor. You have the same waist as my mum when she was young. Crap. Disgusting. All right, here we go. You're doing it on purpose. Here I come. Since meat is so expensive I can't put it to waste It just kicked in. I'll stay here a while. This is so delicious Let's do it again, Rosita You're not a bad cook. You'll look gorgeous in my mum's dress. Do you have a hard-on? ...Jesus, look at it rain. Dirty little bugger. What are you up to? You're nice and comfy, Martí. -You found a good spot. -Don't tickle me! Come on! The whole parish is waiting for you! You slut! The whole village is waiting for you! I love you so much! Cut it out! Are you cold? You should kiss once and for all. Now you two. Jesus, it's freezing. I missed the bus. How come? No, no. I don't think Carla will be back. -It's better that way. -Of course. What? Mireia, don't look at me like that. You make me feel bad. I can't say what I think. -She'll be happier there. -I didn't say a word. What's the name of Víctor's new girlfriend? Happy birthday, Carla. Can't wait to see you here again in Valencia. We're all waiting for you, little squirrel. Little squirrel. Lord, look at this pigsty. Any news? No. Oh. So what will you do? What do you want? Go to the meal. What a pain. I'm not going to the stevedore's dinner. Why not? Víctor will be there too. You might enjoy it more than you think. What? I've nothing against them. I don't want to work there. Dad says there are homosexuals too. Martí! What a journey! -You look gorgeous. -So do you. -I love your beard. -Love yours too. You pig! Wheels don't work. They broke my suitcase. It's knackered. -So I see. -Light as a feather. Valencia... Did you want to come back? A lot. All the others are back. Well, Víctor lives here. How is he? -Isn't he going out with a girl? -Yes. They've made a down payment on a flat. He didn't finish Psychology. He's been working in the port. My parents want me to do the same. I'll die if I don't get the Madrid job. -How's your mother? -Great. She's working in a ministry. My aunt had contacts. They pulled strings? Yes, pretty much. That's how it works there. And you came for Christmas just to see this lot? The flight was cheaper that day. Your mother doesn't mind? They have summer hols now. We'll take a trip when I go back. How do you mean summer? It's summer there now. In the Southern Hemisphere. -Do you celebrate Christmas in August? -No. No, in December. It's December there. But it's summer in December and winter in August. You can go to the beach at Christmas. -Not like here. -Sure. Last year we had Christmas dinner on the beach. Good Lord. I do yoga on the beach every morning. Cool. His balls are this big... It is what it is. Breathe... Nelly, don't force it, know your limits. And back up again. Lower your arms. Take a leg. Lift it as high as you can. If I can't do it, I lower it a bit more and join my hands. Hello? -Raise them. -Yes, that's me. Exhale, lower the leg. -But... seriously? -Set the foot down. -Warrior pose. -Really? Okay, okay. I'll send it this afternoon. Okay, thanks. Okay, fine, thank you. Breathe... They accepted my project! -Three years in Madrid! -Awesome! -Congratulations. -That's brilliant, Martí. I'm so pleased for you. -Great. I'm happy for you. -Thanks. You were right. Oh my God. If they'd told me five years ago that Víctor would end up here... You'd have married him. Hey. Hi. Hi, I'm Carla. I'm Naiara. This is Naiara. Come in. May I? Wow! Some flat, you bugger! We closed off the balconies to make it roomier. -And the furniture? -They deliver it next week. We ordered from a friend who has a design studio. -It's a lovely space. -Thanks. We didn't want typical, local furniture. Typical tacky minimalism. -Like on a cheesy TV set. -Right. With the Audrey Hepburn print they sell in a discount store. The bedroom is this way. But you associate different things with Marilyn. -Right, Alba? -Totally. I think so too. Hi. Who was it, Víctor? -Hi. -Hi. What about Andreu? Hi, Carla. -How are you? -Good, and you? Didn't Andreu come? He's working. -How's work going, Jaume? -Fine. But I can't wait to retire. The good news is that I can freelance starting in the summer, so I'll come back to Valencia. Cool. I want to be with Martí. I'm bloody sick of the Germans. -Need a hand here? -Err... yeah, drink. Alba... -Hey, be careful. -You be careful, dude. I'm going to put on... Our song! -I'll put on El llobarro. -Do it. Long time no see, Jaume. About time! They delivered the furniture today. Scary Shit, it's heavy. Big time. We like a light dinner. Here's to Valencia! The omelette is delicious. Thanks. -Don't mention it. -Seriously? Yes. Don't you want some? No. Otherwise, the pill doesn't give me a buzz. Jesus, dude. Straight to the point. The white cheese. Ten! Eleven! Happy New Year! This is my year! I've got a surprise. A great year. What is it? Fucker. Bitch! Tomorrow is the farewell Come here, come and enjoy yourself Come and play at the camel races Cheap and cheerful Cheap and fun... Yay! Here comes the last chance to move your body. And bit by bit it comes to an end. Go for it, move it! Thanks for your visit, we're off! I've edited up to there. -Artist. -It's a bit... You see everything and nothing. It's awesome. Will you be doing that in Madrid? Madrid? You didn't tell him, did you? Excuse me. I know I screwed up. I made a mess, okay? But I want you to understand that... Sometimes I feel the need... to be as free as you are. -I need to do it alone. -And I need to know you trust me. -Of course I do. -Do you? Will they break up? No way. Now what do I do? Do I tell you? And how do you react? Lighten up, guys, it's party time. All right? -All right? -Yes. I came to pee, but... May I? -Sure, knock yourself out. -Hey, listen. Call me crazy, or maybe I'm just drunk, but Víctor is checking me out. Because you look fab. His girlfriend... She's so dumb. It's really bitter! You're going for it, huh? It's my first time. Who knows when I'll be back. Any seeds for the birdie? The little squirrel ate it all. Carla? Want some? Bloody hell... Let's dance. What's up? I still don't know how to take it. Just be happy for me. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. What's up? Nothing. I'm glad to see you. Me too. The party's starting. Are you coming? Naiara. Sure. It's great to meet you. Same here. Sorry. I never take E, I'm beginning to feel it. Help, help, help. -I got all intense with Víctor. -What? You're really buzzing, right? I'm so glad to see you guys. Your skin's so soft. Andreu is buzzing! Marina, can we... -Can we have a word outside? -No, we're here. Why not? No, please... Come with me. It's just a second. Not in front of everyone. Let's go upstairs. Check out the drama queens. What's going on up there? Want me to fetch them? Yeah! Bloody hell, come down! Yeah, let's go. I know what we can do. Aqua aerobics, like I do with the kids. Get a place, babe. Come on! The things you know about me I can't be bothered To tell the others about them You talk to me about the past An idealised past You tear me up inside Oh, this is a nightmare, it's torture If you could just feel How calm I feel When I'm close to you, more than with anyone else When things go wrong You listen to my complaints Life hurts less If it's with you When things go wrong You listen to my complaints Life hurts less If it's with you If it's with you. I'm gonna dive in. I'm gonna dive in! I'm gonna dive in! I'll die happy! Go on, dive in! The tortilla didn't agree with Naiara. She was dancing like crazy, I saw her from up there. Little angel... -Let's do something. -Where is everyone? Search me... Check out Carla. And Naiara as sick as a dog. -Where is...? -Shut it. There's not much left. I thought I'd left it there. A bit for you, a bit for me. -What a crash. -And the music? Yeah, put on some music. I'm going to take a walk. No, I have to do her teeth. Not the dental clinic thing again. -You do the root canal. -Where is everyone? There's no room, we don't have an appointment. Let's annoy Jaume and Martí. Come here! I feel so lazy. Tell me about it. Coming to the funeral? What funeral? Whose? Vicente's granny. She kicked the bucket yesterday. I thought she died ages ago. They say the devil looks after his own. I love this beach in winter. It's lovely. I didn't think so when I arrived. I want to live somewhere else and see it with fresh eyes. It'll definitely do you good. I... Sometimes I find it hard to believe that I lived here, you know? Not because of anything bad. Sometimes I think about it and it's like... God, did that all really happen? Like a dream. You know what? I'll visit Asturias before I go back to Argentina. To see my dad for the last time. Jesus. Why? Because he's ill. Seriously ill. Sorry. I want to say goodbye to him. And remember the good times with him. Because there were good times too. WHAT WE KNOW
