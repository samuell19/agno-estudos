- It's gonna be a beautiful, sunny day today. - Izzy! He's doing it again! - Might wanna do some outdoor activities. - I am not! - I can see the cereal on the floor. - Raymond, stop tormenting your sister. - Just have him download the X-rays to compare. I'll be there in about 20 minutes. Yeah. OK, bye. - OK, guys! Let's go! Come on! Chop-chop! - Get your stuff. - Jacket, lunch box... - Have a good day. Bye-bye. - Lunchbox, jacket. Here. - OK, bye! - Bye, Dad! - Come on, come on! - Morning, Isabelle. - Good morning. - Good morning! Oh, gross. You always pick the best assignments. - It's because I know how sensitive you are. Take a look, tell me what you think. Nina St-Clair. - Bad news, hon. I gotta cover for Dick Hanson tonight. He got delayed in Phoenix. Nina? You still there? - I'm here. - Look, I'm sorry, honey. It's work. Really. - OK. I'll see you late tonight. - Yeah. Bye-bye. - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing. Just the pressure of the project. - It's Stuart, isn't it? - No! Really, everything's fine. - Okey-dokey. My mistake. - Karen, it's not what you think. Now get outta my office and let me do my job. - OK, well, how about lunch later? And I promise to say only wonderful things about Stuart. - Thank you. If I have time. - OK. Bye! - Maybe I'll work late tonight myself. You and me in the MRI? - You are a fickle woman, Miss Palmieri. Well, you know what? I think I'll take a pass. I've seen Vinnie working out with his patients. Grr! Come on! He's not! Well, look who's being fickle now! - An orderly to surgical supply on 3E, please. Orderly to surgical supply on 3E. - No, Miriam, no. I can't... - Shh. I know what you said, but it's just too hard to see you every day. - Well, this isn't easy for me either. All right? Look, I can't keep jeopardizing my family like this. - Hmm! Then why are you here? I'm not gonna wait forever, Stu. Pretty soon, it'll be just you and the ice queen. - Hello? - Grandma? - This her neighbour. Who's this? - Mary. - Marsha, is that you? - Is my grandma there? - Oh, Marsha. She had a heart attack. She's at Mercy Park in intensive care. - Oh my God! When did it happen? - Two days ago! I didn't know how to reach you! - Tell her Grandma's asking for her, and she has to come. - You have to come. It's real touch and go. - Mary, is my brother there? - Drew? - Don't tell her. - I... I haven't seen him! Please come. Right away. - I wish I could, I really do, but it's just not possible right now. Please, tell her I called. Give her my love. - She's not coming? - Mm-mm. - Dammit! - I don't know what happened! She started out so concerned. Then she just turned cold. Like she didn't care. - Don't say that about my sister. 'Cause she cares. She'll come. - Karen, I have to go out of town for a few days. - What's up? - Just personal business. - Anything you wanna talk about? - No. Can you take care of the office while I'm gone? - Sure. I play boss real well. - Thank you. - Dr. St-Clair's office. Please leave a message. - Hey Stuart, it's me. I have to go to New York on a rush project. I should be back late tomorrow night, OK? - You've never gone away like this before. - It's just work. Tell the kids I'll call them after school, I'm so sorry to leave without saying goodbye, and I'll be back before they know it. OK? - Have a safe trip. - Nina St-Clair. - That's yours, and your key. - Thanks. - Have a good day. - You too. Hi, I'm calling about Frieda Brampton. How's she doing? Yeah, I'm her granddaughter. What room is she in? Is anyone with her? OK, thanks. - Paging Dr. Peter Howley. Dr. Howley, please report to radiology. Dr. Peter Howley. - Marsha? It's you! - How are you, Grandma? - Old and tired. - I'm so sorry I left you alone all these years. - Oh no. We decided long ago what was best. He's here! He... he's at the house. - I suspected that when I talked to Mary. - Poor dear Mary. She's totally smitten. Drew always was irresistible to women. - How is he? - Still devoted to you, Marsha. After all these years. He searched for you high and low. Never gave up trying to find you. - I know. - I never told him where you were. I always kept our secret. - You will come home with me as soon as you're well enough to travel, OK? We'll be a family again. - Don't worry about me, child. I'll be fine. Just... just let me sleep for a little while. - Dr. Lee to dermatology. - Excuse me. Is the doctor available? I'd like to ask him a few questions. - He'll be here later. - She seems very frail. - She'll be OK. She's a real fighter. Um, your brother called, and I told him you were here. He should be here any minute. - Thank you. - Marsha! - Yeah? - Uh, excuse me? - Hold on, I've got a customer. Hi! - Hi. - What can I help you with? - I was just thinking, what kind of car would my son like to ride in? Then it hit me, just like that. I'm gonna rent me a convertible. Any make or model will do, so... - OK, well, I'll see what we got. - Nothing like a rag top to see the sights! - Yeah. - I'll show him where I grew up. - Oh, that's cute. - We'll play ball in the same field where... where... - Sir? Sir, are you all right? Sir? - Relax, it's OK. - We don't have any cash! - I'm just doing a little house cleaning. Where do you keep your rental agreements? Come on, where are the rest? I haven't got all day! Show me the other ones! - OK! - Hi, is this Debbie's boyfriend? Hi! Oh yeah? When was the last time you bought her flowers? Or brought her candy? Why don't you shape up, Jack? Men are such pigs. Thank you. They need to be reminded of what women like, you know? Well, you've been a love, Debbie. Just keep that boyfriend of yours in line, OK? And remind him about the flowers. OK? I'll just have to take this. Thank you, Debbie. - Hi, the name's Nina St-Clair, and I need to drop my car off in Chicago instead. Yeah. My contract number is... 040506. OK. Thank you. - The wandering wife returns. - A very weary wife. How are the kids? - They're fine. Wondering where their mommy was. - What are you doing home? - Just working a half-day. How was New York? - Busy. - Yeah? You had to go in person? You couldn't email or express-mail your illustrations? - Not this time. - I can't understand how they expect you to just drop everything and leave on a moment's notice. - It happens, Stuart. You know how it is. You have to cover for someone at the hospital, have to work late. - Hey. I'm glad you're home. I was worried. - And now for the surprises... - Ooh! - From New York. - What'd you get? - Awesome! - Thanks, Mommy, I love it! - You're welcome. - Come on, kids. Let's do your homework. - Oh, thanks, Isabelle. All right, you two. No video games until it's done, all right? - What'd you get? What is that? - This was nice this evening. I'll be home for dinner more often. - Is that a promise? - Yeah, it's a promise. - Stuart... I've worked really hard to create this life for us. And... I don't wanna lose it. - Hey! You're not gonna lose it. I love you. - Do you know what I'm talking about? - That's over, honey. I told you. - Is that another promise? - You're beautiful, you know that? - I missed you. - Dr. St-Clair? - Yeah? - Or should I call you Stuart? I'm Drew Brampton. I'm your wife's little brother. - Yeah, thank you. Listen, I'm sorry. I think you got the wrong guy. My wife doesn't have a brother. - Oh, she didn't tell you about me. No, I'm not surprised. I'm kind of the black sheep of the family. Um... here, let me get this for you. Salad! - Isabelle said you were away on an art project. I didn't know it was work. - It wasn't exactly work. It was just the easiest thing to say. - So where were you really? Come on, Nina! It wouldn't hurt to open up a bit. We've been friends for a long time! - I never told you much about my childhood. I never told anybody. They're not happy memories. - But you're not gonna tell me more? - It's very difficult for me to talk about it. To relive it. - We all have our skeletons. Nobody's life is perfect. You certainly know what a mess I am! - I do know. But the only way I've been able to move forward is to just put it all behind me, and try to be the best wife and mother I can, even when it's not perfect. - So how are things with Stuart? - Improving. He seems to be making a real effort. - He better be. - Well, I tried to see Marsha... No, it's Nina now! Yeah. I went by the house to see if she was there, and no one was there, and then I found out that you worked here, so... Well, here I am! - All right, look. I don't know what you're trying to pull, OK, but my wife doesn't have any family. - Well, there's only 3 of us now, and Grandma's in the hospital, and she's not doing too well. She didn't tell you about Grandma, either? - No. - OK, now that surprises me, because she was just in Buffalo a couple days ago. Well, if you don't believe me... Nothing? OK, this was obviously a mistake. I had really no idea you didn't know. I'm sorry, I'm gonna go. - No, no. No, stay. Look, I'm just trying to figure this out. Why wouldn't Nina tell me about you? I... I'm gonna call her. - No, I'm afraid if you call her, she'll just disappear like she always does. - What are you talking about? We're family. She's not going anywhere. - Of course. You're right. I'm sure she's different now. I might as well just spill the beans about my sordid past. You're gonna hear soon enough. Um... I spent some time in prison. Actually, it was juvenile detention, when I was 14. - OK. Why? What'd you do? - There was this guy in high school that was always hitting on Nina. And then one night after a football game, he shoves her in his car, and I just knew bad things were gonna happen, so... so I jumped him. And this guy was pretty big, and pretty mean, so I was getting beat up pretty bad. And then suddenly there was this screwdriver in my hand, and, um... Anyway, he died, and I went to juvie. - Let me get this straight here. If you were trying to protect Nina... - Yeah, yeah. And that helped in the trial. But they still gave me 14 months. You know, I'm sorry I killed the guy, but I'd do it again to protect my sister. Right? - When was the last time you saw Nina? - Fifteen years ago. Last time I saw her, she was in, uh, college. And then she just moved around. She stopped writing, and... - All right, Drew, listen. Why don't you come over tonight... We'll see what happens. OK? I invited him because he's your brother, Nina! I can't believe you didn't tell me about him. What are you looking for? - He can be very charming, but you don't know him. - I don't even know you, right? You've been living a lie ever since I met you! - I didn't want to lie, but Drew wasn't just a troubled kid. - No, I'm talking about us. I'm your husband! You could have told me anything, I'd have understood. - It was safer this way. - What are you talking about? What the hell are you doing? Don't you think you might be overreacting just a little bit? - Don't let him fool you. People get hurt when Drew's around. - He told me about the boy that he killed. To protect you. - He told you about that? - Nina, he was 14. He was a kid. - Did he tell you the rest? - Yes, yes. He told me about the stealing, the drugs, everything. - That's not what I'm talking about. - He also told me about your grandmother that you were just visiting in Buffalo. You couldn't even tell me about her? - I don't want him in this house. - He... Nina... He says that he's changed. All right? I, for one, I believe him. He just wants the opportunity to make it up to you. Don't you think you can at least give him that? - You don't understand. It is so much more complicated than that. - Well, look. It's too late now. He's here. All right? - Isabelle, don't answer that door! - Hi! - Hi. You must be Isabelle? - Come on in! - Thanks. - Let me take those for you. - Yeah. - Drew! Look, I'm sorry. This may not have been the best night, and I... - There's my big sister. - I'll handle this, Stuart. Let's take a walk. - You look good, Marsha. I mean, Nina. You've done... done well for yourself. - Keep walking. - Who's that man, Izzy? - I don't know, but I think he's your uncle. - No "Hi, how are you, how'd you find me?" - Toss your gun in the trees. - I'm not like that anymore, Nina. I've changed. - Yeah, sure. Open your jacket. - I called the hospital to see about Grandma. She's recovering nicely. We should go back together and see her. Good? They're gonna be wondering what we're doing down here. - Everything all right? - Everything's fine. You did quite a job on Stuart. - Oh, he seems like a nice guy. After all the other scumbags you've been with. - He's a very nice guy. We're very happy. - I'm glad to hear that, because all I ever wanted was for you to be happy. - Let's get right to it. I will make it worth your while to leave us alone. - Nothing is gonna make me leave you, not after all I went through to find you. - OK. Then I'll call the police. - We've been through that before. You know where that gets you, OK? Listen. I'm not here to hurt you or hassle you. I just wanna be a family again, OK? - Being a family has cost me a lot. - I'm just asking for another chance! That's it! - Last time I gave you a chance, my college boyfriend disappeared. - You're not still blaming me for... what was his name, Brent? Porter? I just saw him a couple years ago, at a racetrack in Florida. - I don't believe you. - Suit yourself. I didn't like him, that's true, but I didn't kill him, Nina! If that's what you've been thinking all these years. Well, I'm gonna wait as long as it takes. I guess we should have handled it differently, huh? - Nina never really did like surprises, so... - She's gonna come around. Anyway, thanks. I appreciate it. - OK. - OK. - It's an old picture, but he hasn't changed much. Chicago University? My husband went there for undergrad. - Oh yeah. Those were the days. Handsome young man. You think he may be in some kind of trouble? - I just wanna find out if he's wanted anywhere, if there are warrants out for his arrest. - All right. You said he's lived in Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans? - That's just what I know. He could have lived anywhere. - Shouldn't be a problem. We'll run him through the computer. - There's someone else I want you to check on. Brent Porter. He would be 38 by now. Born in Dayton, Ohio, went to Ohio State. - OK, Brent Porter. And he's an associate of your brother's? - No. He's... someone I was in love with in college. He disappeared. I wanna see if he's alive. - Romances end all the time, Mrs. St-Clair. What makes you think he's dead? - My brother didn't like him. And there were other incidents. - Wait a minute. You think your brother killed him? Was there an investigation? - Not that I know of. I know this sounds like he dumped me, but he wouldn't have done that. - All right. I'll check it out. - I'm so glad to hear it, Grandma. Yes, he's here. But I don't want you to worry. It's OK. I know. Yeah, it was good to see you too. And I promise, I'll bring the whole family to see you soon. OK, bye. - I couldn't help but overhear. So that's where you went? To see your grandmother? - Yes. - And you couldn't tell me that, why? - It's complicated. I have a brother, too. He's come to visit. - Wow! The whole family's showing up! - Actually, it's serious. My brother's trouble. - I didn't even know you had a brother. Or a grandmother. Are you going to tell me about them? - I'll get it! - Who is it? - Delivery! - I told you not to accept any more flowers. Just send them back. - These are for me! - Are you seeing my brother? - No, just that time he was here. - You would tell me, right? - I don't even know him. - OK, just get them out of here. Put them in your room or something. - His last arrest was '99, for passing bad cheques. Charges were dropped. Nothing since. Looks like your brother's cleaned up his act. - Are you sure? I need to be very sure. - I have a few more sources to check, but it's mainly gonna be misdemeanour stuff. Do you know if Drew ever used an alias? - He could have. Probably. I just don't know what they are. - All right. I'll keep checking. - What about Brent Porter? - Oh yeah, yeah. He was easy. Has a car dealership in Fort Lauderdale, married with 4 children. - Really? Well, I suppose I should be relieved that he really did dump me. All these years, I thought my brother was responsible. - Hey, it happens. I'll keep in touch. - But isn't there the slightest chance that maybe Drew has changed? - I didn't move a dozen times, change my name and create a whole new life for myself because Drew was a little messed up. He's dangerous. Whether he's been punished for it or not. - I thought you said the detective didn't find anything too bad. The old boyfriend is alive and well. - Yeah. But there were others. I mean, it's been a lifetime of strange coincidences. I'm not overreacting. Everyone I got involved with got hurt because Drew thought I wasn't being treated right. Do you understand the ramifications of that? - Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Drew told me about the fire. And how you blame him for your parents' death. - That's not true. OK, maybe you're right. Maybe in the last 15 years, Drew has changed. He's become the brother I always wanted. I would love that to be true. - All right. Then let's try. OK? If he starts acting crazy, then we'll deal with it then. Together. - Just remember, unless you're willing to give up your practice, give up the house, pack the kids up and disappear, my brother is in our lives to stay. - Hey, you know, when it gets warmer, we'll have to take the boat out. You like to sail, Drew? - I've never had the opportunity. But I'm always willing to try new things. - Oh, you'll love it. - Uncle Drew? - Yeah, buddy? - April can't even throw! Can't you come and play with me? - Uh, old Uncle Drew hasn't tossed a ball in a while. You may prefer April. But I'll tell you what, I'll give it a shot. - All right. - April, can I have the ball, please? Oh! OK. - Wow, nice spiral! You're good! - That was good too! - He can't swim. - What? - He can't swim! You can swim? - Yeah, I told you I've changed. And you came to save me, so you care after all! - You're my brother. Let's get out, before we catch pneumonia. - OK. I'll race you. - You know, Drew, you never mentioned any family of your own. Aside from us, of course. - Well, I got married once. Tammy Sue Englekey. A real Georgia peach. We were just too young for it to take. I'm not much for settling down, doing old the 9 to 5, you know? - Drew never had a real job. Or has that changed too? - You see how she is? Depends what you mean by "job." I make a good living, I just don't punch a time clock. - Sounds good to me. Tell me your secret someday! - Well, I play a little cards, I know my horses, I bet on some football, some baseball. I'm what you might call a sport enthusiast. - Or a gambler. - Well... honey, I play some cards myself. A little poker. - You do? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? So you know the thrill, right? Raking in a big pot of cash, it's better than sex! Am I right? - I'll have to talk you into joining our hospital game sometime. We could all use a few pointers. - Why don't you sit in on my game? I'm gonna show you a real thrill. Seriously. - You got a game together that quickly? You just got here. - You know me. I make friends easily. - It's the kind of friends you make that worries me. I don't think involving Stuart's a good idea. - Oh, now, I don't know, hon! I don't see any harm in that. I think it would be fun! - No record of a marriage to Tammy Sue or anybody else. Yeah, puts a real hole in his story. I'm still inclined to think alias, but nothing's showing up. - Well, how can we find out? - He might have kept something with another name on it. Old driver's licence, correspondence. - I'll see what I can find. - Nina! What a surprise! - Thought I'd come see your place. - Yeah! Well, come on in! - It's very nice. - Yeah. - Lots of light! I see you're still afraid of the dark. - Well, some demons never die. - It looks like you're directly across from us. - Am I? - You wouldn't be spying on us, would you, Drew? - What a thing to say! Of course not! Well, make yourself at home. What can I get you? Coffee, fruit, something? - Uh, no thanks. How about a beer? - Yeah, sure. Here you go. Please, have a seat. I can't believe you're here, having a beer in my living room! - Amazes me too. - I looked everywhere for you, Nina. You hide real well. You got a different name, a different career. - I kept up with some of your whereabouts through Grandma. You were always on the move. - Never found that perfect place. Until now. Things are going pretty well between us, don't you think? - Mm. Seem to be. - Yeah. - Look, Drew, I'm willing to put the past behind us, but it's gonna take some time. You understand that, right? - Sure. I got all the time in the world. And you won't regret it. - I hope not. - Oh! Let me do that. - No! I thought you wanted me to feel at home. - Did Stuart tell you we're playing poker tonight? - Poker is a bad idea. Stuart's a terrible card player. Don't let him lose the house. - Hey, he's my brother-in-law! I'll take care of him. OK, Stuart. It's not about cards, and it's not about luck, OK? It's about the players. And the first thing you gotta do is lose. Which means you gotta fold with winners. Now, most social players can't do it, particularly with high stakes, but I got a feeling you're gonna be fine. Let's go. - What kind of high stakes we talking about here? - $50 minimum, $500 max. What? It's not too late to back out now, if you want. Never be embarrassed to acknowledge your limitations. - No, I'm in. I'm in. - OK. Then here's how it works. You dump all your cards after the first raise, OK? No matter what you got. Even if they're good. You kind of show your cards casual-like. OK? Then after you establish that pattern, right? You go for broke. Doesn't matter if you're holding a pair, 'cause they don't know. - Yeah. All right. Let's do this. - OK. - This is as far as I'll go. I could lose my licence. - I'll take it from here. - Do you want me to wait? - No. I know where he is. - Sorry, Daddy! No! Stop it! Stop it, Daddy! I didn't do anything! - Hello? Drew? Drew, are you there? A package came for you. Hello? Hello? - Check. - $200. - Fold. - Well, looks like... it's time for me to take a chance. I see your $200, and raise you... ...another $500. - No, I fold. - Yeah. Too rich for me. - Let's see what you've got. - Three aces. - Son of a bitch. - Whoa, look at the time. It's almost 11:45. Doc's got an early call tomorrow, so we gotta go. Sorry, guys. - Sure. Just take the money and run, huh? - Hey guys, I'll... I might still give you a chance next week. I promise, OK? Thanks. Thank you. Oh man, when he kicked the chair, I almost peed my pants! - I'm glad you enjoyed it! Now you know how it's done! - Ah, thanks, Drew. I mean... - Hey! - Listen, uh... Don't tell Nina too much about tonight, OK? She didn't really want me to come. - No, my lips are sealed, but you better get out of here before Rivas wants to recoup his losses. OK, buddy. - All right. Goodnight. - Enjoy your winnings, huh? - Thank you! - That was a good performance, guys. You're gonna love me forever. There you go. - Don't ever ask us to take a fall again. Not for a chump like that. - Whatever. - Well, look who's here! The family man. - I won 5 grand in poker tonight. - Hmm! Congratulations. Um... Let me guess. The ice queen wouldn't approve. - Mm. Well... Let's just say... I wanna be able to enjoy my good fortune this evening. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. You came to the right place. - Oh, did I? - Oh yeah. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - God, I missed you. - Me too. Mmm... - I like, uh, 4Bs. It smudges, but you get a deep, rich texture. But I'm only an amateur. You look like a real artist. - I use the softer leads myself, depending on what I'm working on. - Yeah. - What kind of drawing do you do? - I... I do portraits, mainly. You know, from old family photographs. How about you? - Um, I'm a medical illustrator. - That's impressive! Um... I'm Russ. Tomkins. - Karen Reynolds. Always happy to meet a fellow artist. - Me too. Um... I don't suppose you have time for a cup of coffee? - I really wish I could, but I have, like, a dozen errands to run, and then I have to get back to work. - OK, sure. - But... let me give you my card, and then maybe we can get together some other time. - Yeah! - This is my cell phone. - OK. Well, I'll definitely call. - OK. - I will. - Bye. - OK, bye. Oh, hey sis! Did Stuart tell you how much money he won last night? - Yes. He was very excited. - Yeah, he'll tell that story for the rest of his life. And I gave him that experience. No one else could. - It's a dubious honour, Drew. Don't do it again. - Uh, you know Stuart invited me over for dinner tomorrow? - Yes. You two are just becoming inseparable. Look, I have to get to work. - OK. - I'll see you tomorrow. And Drew? The next time you take Stuart out, have him home before 3:00 AM. He has a real job, OK? - So the credit cards are not stolen. They are legitimate accounts under different names. He must be paying the minimums online. - What about the false ID? That's illegal, isn't it? - It's nickel-and-dime stuff. It won't put him away, if that's what you're hoping for. - No. I'm probably just being overly cautious. Why don't you try Tammy Sue once more with the aliases? If you don't find anything, I think we're done. - You got it. - Hey, gorgeous. - You weren't supposed to come until later. - Yeah, I know. Just... couldn't wait to see you. How long have you worked for my sister and Stuart? - Almost two years. They're a great family. - Is there any problems between them? It's probably nothing. It's just something my sister said made me think that they're having difficulties. - I know she hates it when he works late. - Do you think he's seeing someone? - I'd hate to say anything. - Who do you think it is? - I heard them fighting about it once. I think it's someone at the hospital. - Why would someone jeopardize their happiness? Cheat on a wonderful woman, the whole family? - I know. It's terrible. Sometimes I hear her crying at night. - Hey, gorgeous. - Hey! - How are ya? - Good, how are you? - Come here often? - Once in a while, when you're around. How was your weekend? - Dr. Lee to dermatology. - See you tomorrow? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Great dinner, Nina. You gotta teach me how to make this salmon. - Talk to Isabelle. - Hello? Yeah, just a second. It's the hospital. - Isn't it always! If you'll excuse me. Be right back. Yeah? - Is he always on call? - Just sometimes. - Mm-hmm. - Just hold on a second. Amy Palmieri's been in an accident. Sounds like she's busted up pretty bad. - What happened? - Something about her brakes. She's in emergency. - You better go! - Yeah, I think I should. Sorry. Yeah, I'm on my way right now. - Excuse me, I gotta let someone know I'll be late. It'll just take a second. Hey, it's me. I think the right opportunity's presented itself. He'll be at the hospital in 20 minutes. OK. - I hope she's all right! - Who's Amy Palmieri? - She works with Stuart. - They good friends? - No, she's just a kid at the hospital. - Hey, how you doing? I remember you! - What are you grinning at? - Hey! - Next time you play cards, go directly home. For the record, asswipe... You couldn't win a hand of poker if your life depended on it! - No, I don't know who it was. It's just this guy. He smashed me in the face, and he took my wallet. - I can't believe it happened right here at the hospital. - Yeah. - Radiology is really under siege tonight. - Oh, right. Amy! How's she doing? - I'm sorry, Stu. I thought you knew. - Hello? I'm sorry, she's not here. Who is this? Is something wrong? - What was that about? - I don't know. Some man calling for Nina. He sounded upset. - It's probably nothing. - I made a huge mistake on Brent Porter. I have to admit, when you first came to see me, I didn't take you all that seriously, and the Brent Porter I found in Florida seemed to fit all the criteria you gave me, so I didn't look any further. The skeletal remains of a John Doe were found a year ago in the mountains near the campus. Police figured it'd been there 14, 15 years. They wrote it off as an old hiking accident. Missing Persons case was a completely different jurisdiction, no signs of foul play. I gave them Brent's name, and, uh... it checked out. I'm really, really sorry. You were right all along. - He was my first love. We would have gotten married. - Tammy Sue has surfaced, this time as Amber Harmon. Married to James Carter, alias Drew Brampton, in Greenville, North Carolina, October 14th '95. She was reported missing by her mother February 23rd of the following year, and has yet to be located. - Did they question my brother? - Yes, but they did not have enough evidence to hold him. - I never should have allowed myself to believe he could change. And now he's killed Amy. - I'd like to check her car. The police had no reason to suspect foul play. Maybe Drew left some kind of evidence behind. This guy's gotta screw up sometime! - Do it right away. My family's in danger. - I'll get right on it. I'm sorry, Nina. - Nina, this is a nightmare. I can't believe this is happening. - Friezen will find something. He has to. Until then, I think we should just pretend everything's OK. I mean, if he thinks you were involved with Amy, he will think he solved the problem, and he won't hurt me. But... I just... I don't want the kids around this. I don't know, maybe we could send them to your brother's... - Oh, great. - Oh, man! You look terrible! Sorry to drop by uninvited. I just wanted to see how my buddy was doing. How you doing? Hi, Uncle Drew! - Who wants to go to the track and watch the horsies? - Me! - Me! - I'm afraid not. We're all staying home with Daddy today. - That's a good idea. We'll send out for pizza, watch a little football. - Go up and play. I'll call you when the pizza gets here. - Yeah, go ahead, guys. I'll teach you some Texas Hold 'Em later, I promise. - Yes! - All right! Ah, the races! You remember that, Nina? When Mom and Dad used to take us to the track? And then get blind drunk and lose all our money? - Let's not relive the past. - Or what about the time they forgot we were even there, and left us in the stands, and the cops had to take us home? - Since you started it, what about the time Dad locked you in the closet for 3 days and then broke my arm when I tried to let you out? - Can't top that one. - We've talked enough about the past. I'll be upstairs with the kids. - It's a touchy subject. - You had me beaten up. - Yes, I did. Where did you go after the poker game? - I went to see a patient at the hospital. Where the hell do you think I went? - Just judging from your history... Maybe I jumped to the wrong conclusion. I don't know. - I could have told the police about Rivas. - Well, why didn't you? - I didn't wanna open up that particular can of worms. - That's right. - All right, Drew. You've made your point. - I'm having a little trouble getting my pastels to blend, and I thought maybe we could have dinner, and you could give me a few instructions? - Yeah, those pastels can be tricky. What time? - You tell me! I know a little bistro on the West Side. I could pick you up. - Why don't I meet you there? Say, 8:00? - That's perfect. It's called Bella Luna, it's on State Street. - I know the place. I'll see you there. - OK. - That was great. Yeah. - What are you doing tailing me, man? - Take it easy, man. I ain't following you. - That's funny. "Take it easy." OK. That's cute. Why don't you move? - Easy, pal! - Since we haven't been formally introduced... OK, let's see what we got here. "George Friezen, confidential investigations." Seems like I've seen that name before. You working for my sister? - I don't know what you're talking about, man. - Ouch! Ah! - I got no beef with you, all right? I'm just doing my job! - How much does she know? - Oh God! - How much does she know? How much does she know? - Nothing! I swear to God, I just started. - Don't lie to me. - All right, look. I'll tell her whatever you want, all right? I'll give you a clean bill of health and tell her you joined the church choir. - I could be able to trust you, but I gotta believe too much damage has been done already! - Drew, come on, man! You're too smart to kill me. - You're almost right. I'm too smart to get caught. Hi, Karen? Listen, I'm running a little late. I'll be there in about 30 minutes. OK. Great. OK, bye. So how come a beauty like you has never gotten married? I'm sure you've had plenty of opportunities. - Yeah, from what I see of marriage, it's not all it's cracked up to be. - Yeah. - How about you? - No, I'm gonna stick to drawing pictures. No, my best friend, he ruined his marriage with cheating. And he had a great wife and two kids. I couldn't understand it! - I know. I have the same situation with my friend. - Really? - Her husband has been having this affair for years, and she keeps hoping it's over! - And don't the women they cheat with always have the obvious names, like Amber? Like, Starr or something like that? - Yeah, not in this case. Would you believe Miriam? - Miriam? - Sounds like my grandmother. - Miriam. Well, there goes my theory. Hmm. Are you finished with your dessert? - Yeah. Let's get outta here. - This is George Friezen. Leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you. - It's Nina St-Clair. I need an update. Call me. Thank you. What were you doing with my brother? - What, your brother? - Yes! Who did you think that was? - He told me his name was Russ Tomkins. I met him at the art store! - Karen, my God! I told you how dangerous he is. - I didn't know! I mean, why would he lie to me? - Because he's a psychopath! What did you tell him? - Nothing! - You didn't say anything about Stuart cheating? - I... I didn't know he was your brother! - Did you tell him it was Miriam Jordan? Karen? I have to know. - We were talking about names. It seemed really innocent. - Oh my God! - I didn't know! Yes, I told him, but... - Radiology department. - It's Nina. Is Stuart there? - Hi, Nina. Uh, he's on a consult down in surgery. Can I have him call you back? - Is Miriam Jordan around? - Just one second, I'll see if I can find her. - You have to promise me you'll never see him again. Do you understand? - I'm sorry, she's out. Can I take a message? - No, that's not necessary. Promise me you will never see him. No matter what. - I promise. - He's still not back. I can page him. Thank you, Martha. - If you're looking for Dr. St-Clair, I just saw him on 2, going into the storage room. - I can page him anyway. - No, that's fine, Martha. I'll find him. - He had me beaten up. He's the one that killed Amy! If he finds out about us... - But you're not even sure about Amy. It could have been an accident. - I'm not taking any chances. You can't be careful enough with this guy. - He obviously doesn't know about us. Not if he thinks you and Amy were together! - Miriam, we can't be sure. OK? From this moment forward, we have to pretend like we've never met. You understand? I don't want anything to happen to you. - OK. - All right? - Paging Dr. Judy Baker to nurses' station. Paging Dr. Judy Baker to nurses' station E. - Nina... Nina. Nina! Nina! Nina, wait! Look, this was an isolated incident, I swear! - I cannot believe I came to warn you both. - It won't happen again, I promise. - How stupid can you be, after everything you know about Drew? - God! I know, OK? I know. I'm sorry. OK? It just happened. I... But listen, he won't find out! - He already knows! And don't bother coming home. We're done! - Nina! Nina... - And it's a short kick. Rogers takes it to 30. - If it's Nina, don't tell her I'm here! It'll only upset her, OK? - Hello? - Isabella, it's Nina. Oh, hi Nina! - Have you heard from my brother? - No, I haven't. Not today. - If he's there with you, I need to know. - Of course not. Why, what's wrong? - If he comes to the house, do not let him in. Do you understand? Take the kids and go to a movie. - I don't understand. - Just do it. - What's going on? - My crazy sister? You know how she is about me. Come here. - Drew... Drew, stop it. The kids will see you! - Don't be upset with old Drew. - Nina was very upset. - Come on, kids. Get in the car. We're going out. - What about Mom? - She's gonna meet us later. First one in the car gets ice cream! - I'm gonna call Nina back, tell her what's going on. - No you're not. - What... - This wasn't the plan, but I can't have you interfering. - Well, we can go to my uncle's place in Southeaven. He'll never find us there. - Nina warned me this would happen. I just didn't believe her. I'm gonna have to give up everything to escape this guy! - OK. Come on, let's go. - Raymond? April? Isabelle? Raymond! April! Isabelle? Hold on! Where are the kids? - He took them. - Where? - I don't know! He said they needed to be protected, just like you. - How long ago did they leave? - Maybe 15 minutes. - I have to go find them. Are you all right? - I'm so sorry. - No, it's not your fault. I should have warned you about him. - Oh my God! - OK, you can sit wherever you want, guys. - Let's go in the second row! - Yeah. - Way in the front. OK. Kids, I gotta run a couple of errands, and then we'll go pick up your mom, OK? - Well, can't we come with you? - Please? - No, you'd be bored to tears. This is a good movie! I'll be back before you know it. You can tell me everything I missed. - OK. - Save me some popcorn. - If there's some left! - Yeah! - OK, guys. - Stuart, come on! Come on! - We shouldn't have come here. - I'll be ready in a minute! - Just hurry, OK? - Drew? What have you done with my children? If anything happens to them, I swear, I'll... - Don't worry, OK? They're safe. I wouldn't do anything to hurt them. - This has got to stop! You are sick, all right? You need help. - What about you? When will you get some help for always picking the wrong guys? - There was nothing wrong with Brent! Why did you kill him? - Because he wasn't gonna make you happy. He was gonna get some crappy little job and keep me out of your life! And you know, it really hurt that you hired that sleazeball detective to tail me. - Oh my God! - Oh, thanks. - OK, let's go. - What, are you going somewhere? - There's a man with a gun at 2295 Hanover Street, unit 410. Hurry! Come on! - Drew... You don't have to do this. - That's OK, brother-in-law. You can go. I won't hurt the father of my niece and nephew, right? So you can go. - No, no. You're not leaving me alone, Stuart. - He's a family man now. He's got obligations. What don't you understand? Go ahead. - Miriam, I'm sorry. - Come on, Stuart. - You pig! - You really think I'll let you walk out after all the pain you caused my sister? Where do you think you're going? Consequences are a bitch, aren't they? I got this pretty chick gun for you. You listening? This is how it's gonna go down. It's gonna go "bang," and then it's gonna go "bang." Murder-suicide... - Drew! - Nina, turn on the lights! - Drew! Drop the gun! - Turn on the lights! - Is Stuart dead? - Not yet. - Drew, you don't want to do this. - They deserve it. - But my children don't. Please, tell me where they are. - I told you, they're safe. - Please, Drew, listen to me. Listen to me! - What? - It's over with Stuart! I told him to get out. I don't care about him anymore. - But I care, because somebody's gotta pay for all the disrespect and the pain and the humiliation! And that... - Get up, Drew! I'm sorry. - Ow! - Go, go! I'm fine! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Come on! - I'm sorry. We'll get you some help, OK? - Oh! - I'll get you some help. - Ow! Are you gonna save me again, sis? I remember... All hell broke loose. Sorry, Daddy! - Stop whining, you brat! - No! Stop it! Ma was screaming at you. Stop it, Daddy! I didn't do anything! And the old man was bleeding, and you grabbed my hand, and we ran. I was so scared. I was sure he was gonna find us, and we were gonna end up being his batting practice for the day. And the only reason he finally stopped was because he was too drunk to keep going. And then you got the sleeping bags out of the garage, and we locked ourselves in the car. And then later, when you thought I was asleep... I watched you. It's just like we saw on TV. But I lied awake all night, waiting for the old man to spark that first cigarette. Kaboom! That was better than the 4th of July. - Drew... What I did then was wrong. It's tortured me ever since. - I'll always owe you for that day. - What a mess. I'm so sorry, baby brother. - I... All I ever wanted was for us to be a family again. - I know. I know. - What makes you think you're worthy of going through the orb? - We're not scared of you! - Please move along quickly! - Get out of our way! - You'll never pass through the orb! - What happened so far? - The man in the hat is the bad guy. When he was younger... - Shh! This is the best part! - ...from the days of young! The door is closing. - Get down, Giselle, Rod! You're in danger! - We're not gonna make it in time! - You can do it! Run! - Stop them, Reeves, stop them! - Keep going, children! - Here we are, guys. Come on. Come on, sweetie. There she is! Told you all about her. - Hello! I made cookies specially for the occasion. - You guys don't need to be shy. It's your great-grandma. Go say hello. - Why don't you come inside? - It's good to be home. Closed captions:Global Vision
