Louise! Louise, where are you? Louise! Rurik, have you seen Louise? You will unfortunately have to quit your job, Vivan. You may stay in the servants' room until we have found a new wench. I am not a wench. - Excuse me, what did you say? Madam can call me housemaid or whatever, but I am not a wench. Does it matter, considering the circumstances? You have deceived me and my wife. The situation could be solved if you found an abortionist. That is a no, I presume. In that case there is not much we can do. You must leave before the holidays. There will be no payoff. There are enough decent servants anyway. I have a man who can provide for me. - Excuse me? Pardon my suspicions for HIS serious intentions. My man is a good man! Enok Kajander. I came to meet my fiancé. And to exchange some words with director Lilliehjelm. Sir should know, that my fiancé has a right to get her salary. The Helsinki workers' association will see to it. I do not fear any workers' associations. We have many poor people in Helsinki and their strength just keeps growing. Are you threatening me? Louise! Wake up, Louise! Please take your music sheets with you, dear Louise, so you can practise. Lu, don't forget Endymion. Will you be reciting it at the poetry evening? Hurry up, Louise! - Why do I have to go? Bring suitable clothes for the dinner! - Boring dinners - with boring people. Boring walks and tennis. Behave now. - Siggan, could you help! We'll be right behind. Where is young Mr Widing? - Waiting at the gate. Marie, Olga? Eric Widing, good day. Eric Karl. Nice to meet you. Good day. Eccu, you remember Louise? Let me introduce Eric Widing, my school friend. We did meet a couple of years ago. Are you joining us at the dull tournament, that my sister will win? Is Miss Louise herself not playing? - She is just envious of Sigrid. Hurry up, Louise. Call me Lucie, all my friends do. Look. Rumour has it that your sister has not lost one set. That is not correct. Three years ago she lost - a whole game in Nice, the semifinals. The winner of last years ladies' tournament traditionally meets - one of this year's new challengers. That will be Miss Sigrid Lilliehjelm versus Miss Lucie L. Miss Lucie L.? Louise? From here on I will be adressed as Miss Lucie, if you permit. Game to Sigrid Lilliehjelm, leading the set 4-0. Love - fifteen. Miss Sigrid Lilliehjelm has won all the points so far. Hello. - Hello. They are worried about you. - I just wanted to be alone. The others don't seem to understand. - What about you? I think you were magnificent. It is palpable. - What is palpable? You are as enchanted with Lucie Lilliehjelm - as most of the young men in Helsinki. - You too? Hardly. There are only two ways to have a woman. The first is a promise of marriage, which does not suit me. What remains is a business transaction. I know where we can meet willing women. Interested? You are good. Are you in a team? - I'm too young. You will grow. - Are you a kind of a rich man? You could say that. - My father says you can't trust them. Do you want to be photographed? Allan! - Father! The Germans are training Finnish servicemen to help us win the war. Let's go to Germany when school is over. To the jäger battalion. - To Germany, that would be great. Then we could chase away both Russians and socialists, for good. Try this. Is it not banal falsification of history - to portray Jesus as a socialist? Of course, Zweygberg. Nevertheless, one can not ignore the pathos of righteousness - or the permanent presence of proletarian instinct in his sermons. Therefore it is not entirely wrong to call the New Testament - the first socialist manifesto in the world. What on earth is proletarian instinct? - To roll in one's own excrement. So it is God's will, that we share everything? We already do. The question is, how we get everyone else to see it has to be that way. He seems sympathetic, don't you think, Zviga? Symphathetic? Are you becoming a socialist too? Maybe he is just a plain humanist. Or maybe you don't know that word? Your humanism means rejecting eager suitors at most. Those poor things just don't see the charitable action of it. As a transaction, father has chosen Lars von Nottbäckin as your fiancé. Father appreciates your commercial value. Father can't sell something he doesn't own, and he knows that. A Zolaika cake. An Alexander cake. What do you want? - Nothing, please. And a mocha-meringue. The Tsar has been unseated! The Russians have unseated the Tsar. Long live Finland! Hurray! Now we won't have to swallow our anger anymore. Now we will chase the Russians out, for good. Allan mostly has to care for himself. He won't say where he's been. I'm afraid he's on the streets. I don't want him in some bunch. It's called a gang. They don't accept small kids who can't fight. Your revolution rubbish is to blame. - I can't be blamed for that. God knows what will happen next. - The fight for justice has just begun. There'll be more strikes in the fall. The upper crust won't rule anymore. And now the Russians will help us. Happy birthday, Lucie! - Cheers! Congratulations. I'm sorry I did not get You a present. But Your father... - Please, call me by my first name. Your father asked for a family portrait. I can make you a copy, if you like. On real platinum paper. - Are you a real artist? I would hope so. - Then you cannot give things away. An artist always takes a reward. - My father wants me to... Is this your new Kodak? You just press here? - No, don't. I still have things to arrange. - Do you only take portraits? No, I am going to be a documentarist. And? I want to capture that what lives and rushes. The human. Come! Show me! What about the portrait? - We can take it later. Come! We'll travel together in Europe after the war. I won't stay in Helsinki. Immer so dunkel, immer so nass. Man kann ohne Licht nicht leben. What is that? - Mother used to say about Helsinki, - that it is always so dark and wet, but one cannot live without light. Let's go. The family portrait. Come on now! I think it is too risky. - Not in Italy. No, but on the way down there. - Not if I have an escort. No language courses this summer! - What shall I do then? What about university? - In Helsinki! And you, young man, do not give my daughter any ideas! Eccu is innocent, quite the contrary. - Thank you for breakfast. Sit down and wait until everyone else is finished. Act like an Lilliehjelm. - Unreasonable, according to father. Good morning. We have a commission to look for arms stashes. What commission? We do not have arms. Then you won't mind, if we look on our own. Only one hunting weapon. Krogell, go with Lilliehjelmin to get the hunting weapon. And you, - you will show Marjamäki the way to the boathouse. You will show Halme the way to the tool shed. Can I offer you some cake? - No, thank you. Would that boy like a piece? - Thank you Miss. Cedi. Don't do anything rash. - Shut up. Father said that there will be no shooting. There won't be. Senator! Someone like me has to fear both sides. I am a sorry coward, that cannot arouse anything but hatred in all. If they knew me well enough, they would compete about garotting me. You see, that is the law of war and the human mind. Ivar Grandell, are you there? I am Enok Kajander. I know you are on our side. The revolution needs you. Seek me out if you change your mind. Ask for Black Enok. Oh. What is it? The Bolsheviks nationalize companies when papers become worthless. Then you get disgracefully removed from the railway company. Put your foot down! Not just anyone can take the job - that only father is qualified for. Get off father's back! - You are just as indifferent. Don't you understand the severity? - And you do? You only worry about - the curfew, that hinders you from gallivanting in speakeasies. Papers! The correct word is identification. Yes, it is me. I am looking for Cedric. - He left days ago. There are rumors about White free corps outside Helsinki. Do you know if Cedi has joined one? - He has probably joined them all. Is it important to you? - We have to do something. Anything is better than hiding out like rats. We cannot stay in Helsinki, everything is closed. I have to go. - Wait! I am going to Björknäs. Come with me. Farewell. - Eccu! Be careful. Promise! It is impossible to cross the ice here. It is better to start in Taivallahti, and then go out behind Seurasaari. I am sorry, but I will not go. All resistance is useless. There are too many Reds, and the Russians help them. We must do something! - Eccu, it is pure suicide. Halt! Halt or I will shoot! To Louise Lilliehjelm after my death Stop! - Don't shoot! I want to join! Zviga... He... I was looking for Cedi, but I... So, you are awake. Here. I am Aina Gadolin. We have met before. Thank you. - At the ball, - after the tennis tournament. You probably do not remember me. You were with Miss Lilliehjelm. Rest now, please. I will make supper. I don't feel sick, can I not get up? - You have a fever, nothing worse. It stems from the cold and the overstrain. If you get something warm you'll be up again by the evening. Miss Gadolin. - Yes? I am sorry, I do remember you now. My friends call me Eccu. I will look in again soon, Eccu. You'll stay here. Load off the glass and porcelain, but leave on food and list it. We are commandeering the carriage and the food. This is the lady of the house. Talk to her about it. Show me the kitchen. The cows' should be milked. We don't have the time, too many have left. Halme, take the inspector and Krogell with you to the barn. Count how many we need to care for the animals. They should not suffer. Oh, it's only you. Don't touch anything. Take off your shoes. And who are you, if I may ask? - I'm with the Reds. Well, that explains. You can go anywhere you like and take whatever you want. Tell me who you are. It is not like you are mute. I am Allan Kajander. My father is the chairman of the provisions com... committee! That is a fine merit. You should not be up here. Take the perfume. I did not like it anyhow. Father said I must not touch anything. - I promise I won't tell. But leave now and promise to take your Father Chairman with you. The Finnish workers have authorized us. Our duty is to commandeer, so that people won't freeze or starve. You'll be paid when the economy and everything else is in order. How the hell are you going to create order? Has any one of you even finished elementary school? You damn butchers. Don't talk to me like to a beggar. I'll shoot him right here. - No-one shoots nothing. It's him who partitions the fishing waters. My brother is a fisherman. He got Ahvenkari and Haukilahti. Don't moan, those sound good. - There's no fish! They should be called fishless! - But we don't shoot because of that. Father, where are the others? Damn. Stop! Bloody butcher! Now it's your turn! Stop! A list of Whites we'll shoot. What the hell is happening here? Calm down. - The hell I will! Bergkvist shot a shopkeeper and threw him in the swamp. Helander shot a crofter because he hid some oat. Many are overheated. - Those were executions. Marjamäki doesn't even feel remorse. Those murderers just brag. You shouldn't call them murderers. - What then? Be reasonable, and rest some. - You know as well as I do, - that this is going to pot. - We can't control the men fully. Isn't it justice we want, not a bloodbath? Those traitors ravaged our country. Their demands are based on anarchy and violence. Society's worst elements are splitting up our country - instead of fighting with us against our arch-enemy, Russia. The free Finland now trusts its life to general Mannerheim's troups. Good morning. How did you sleep? Well, thank you. - The look reveals all. The Reds have layed siege to the area at night. We need voluntary observers. Men, it is time. Attack! Attack! Attack! Maybe I am the only one afraid. I have seen people die. The sick have just passed away. Many are calm in the end. All are equal before death. Cedi! Lucie! Eccu! Are you good? I'm all right. - Is Cedi there? Don't you know where he is either? Good morning. Prime Minister Kullervo Manner is expecting me. Comerade Manner is not here. - Might you help me then? It concerns the prisoners of war. You mean the rebels that were taken to the lyceum. Call them what you like. Is my brother among them? The name was? - Cedric Lilliehjelm. I'll have a look. Cedi! Eccu! Prisoner of war, Cedric Lilliehjelm, asks for permission - to temporarily leave his group to sit at a different table. Eccu. How did you dare to ask her? - The Black Angel you mean? That is what she is called. Quiet as a fallen angel, black as sin. A damn whore if you ask me. Was Zviga not with you? He was shot in the back in February. So he is dead? Damn, to be disarmed by people, - I would not even let empty the latrine at Björknäs. A passport for you and your son? He'll be safer with his mother in Helsinki. I warn you, because you are a friend. People are talking behind your back. Don't we have enough enemies? Do we have to fight each other too? The choice is yours, not ours. Are you afraid of them? What do you mean? Why would I fear? There is nothing to worry about. They are quite reasonable, if you compromise a little. They want you to sign a paper. I asked for my books - from the University of Technology. You should sign too, it is for the best. Did someone persuade you to look for rebels at Sigurds? - No. Do you still think it was right? - Yes. Is Cedric Lilliehjelm a close friend to you? Yes. Was it him that persuaded you to take up arms? - No. If you want us to promise never to threaten you with arms again, - give me the paper, and I will sign. But why? - It's safer for him here. Where is it safe? Have you got into disfavour? - No, I haven't, - but the moods are a problem. - See now what your revolution does. Take your coat off, son, and sit down. There's enough for you both. - Nothing for me, thank you. Almost 35 000 potatoes have arrived to the western archipelago - and these potatoes were of the best Pomeranian quality. It is German soldiers. Here it says that Mrs Frostelius has made a painting, a factory landscape. She writes that she chose a white frame for it. Friends, listen up! Tampere is ours! And Helsinki awaits us behind these walls! Let's overtake the guards! If we do it together they don't stand a chance! We are many, they are few! Calm down, not yet. You whore, you will not make it. - Take him. The Pomeranian potatoes are here. The German army cut the throat of the red dragon - like Wagner's hero Siegfried. We thank you. So there you are, Kajander. You are lucky I did not find you first. Damn murderer! Father! Have you shot somebody? Will they shoot you? Don't worry, Allan. Everything will turn out fine. Farewell, Zviga. Please forgive me. The White Guard has regrouped. I and Julle are in Viapori. New prisoners come in daily. I have signed up for the Länsi-Uusimaa batallion. What will it do? - Put things in order of course. What the hell do we have to do with them? It is our duty. Think of who they murdered. They must be punished. I am in. I will talk to Bruno too. Eccu? - But we signed the paper. We promised not to take revenge. - I did not sign such a paper. You were prisoners. You were threatened, right? Henning? - True. It's never the losers who dictate the rules. A real man should help his country and people. I cannot believe he would have been in battle. He has always been a man of peace. He has six children, and they have suffered no need. He has confessed that he took part in battle. The law only admits a death sentence. Take you positions! Aim. Fire! Recharge! Aim. Fire! The Reds commissioned the oats. - It was theft anyhow. The children need food. Where is your husband? - He died in Tampere. And your firstborn? We're looking for him too. - I don't know. And if I knew I would never tell. According to our information you had him at 16, and the father is unknown. Fire! Can we not release them now? Have they not been punished enough? Ask Cedi, it is his call. I have always avoided him when he turns that way. Is it possible to imagine your best friend as evil? Can it be, that one is powerful and the other constantly fears? Is that friendship at all? This is the time of action, not of friendship. No! For God's sake! Can't you see she's expecting our baby? Ready! Fire! Therefore it is general Mannerheim's order, - that illegal trials or executions must not occur. All matters will hence be setteld in court. The battalion will not yet be dissolved. We still have the mandate to look for Red Guards. I need a group for Vesala and Kumberla. We cannot let them free the prisoners without trial. To be executed, to be executed, to be executed. This is not right. We need our workmen. They are prisoners of war who have fled justice. These are people who we have lived with for ages. People who we work with, - and who take care of their jobs. Some ran amok when the Reds ruled, but no greater harm was done. Those sentenced to death must be executed. It is the law. Decide for yourself to which camp you send the rest. We will not execute the women. We also ask for permission to conduct the executions ourselves. Granted. Sometimes I almost think you are on their side. Less would be enough. All this killing... - It is the law, Eccu. The sentence is always ordered according to the deed. We do this because we have to. None of us want to do it. The bride and groom! Come! Come on up. Go on and play now. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO WIDING I have some coffee and fresh baked. - Thank you, but not now please. Would Sir look at the accounts? - I trust that they are correct. That is up to Mr Widing to decide. - In that case I desist. So, how are the English lessons? - I'm taking private lessons now. Are you going to Mrs Sirenius? - No, a student. She is inexpensive. Miss Lilliehjelm. When did you get home? - Around midnight, I think. You work too much. You cannot go on like this. - I know. This little seed is put in the soil, like that. And when it grows, out comes a carrot. It's been a long time! Welcome! Have you seen Lonni's advert for the new toothpaste? Rectal - your breath has never smelled better The funniest part is that Cedi's company imports it. Has he seen that? - I don't think so, he would kill Lonni. Cheers, friends! A toast to all the secrets, - that will be revealed sooner or later. I presume no-one has lost their manners due to a couple of tea cups? My sister is right. We all have secrets. And everyone makes mistakes. Good evening. - Good evening. Once a Red, always a Red. Don't show up here again. Are you Black Enok's son? - Allan Kajander. Allu is with me. What about tomorrow then? - I'm in. Should you not try again, Santeri? - They would not take me anyhow. I'll help. Sit down, dinner is ready. I'm not hungry. You just eat. Want to join the gang? - Woima? That would be great. Then we might even win. No, it takes too much time. - But you will help my sister move. Do you speak English? Thank you. Move! - Eccu! Is everything all right? - Really well. Are you sure? - I swear. Do you want company? - No thank you, no need. Some fresh night air, and everything will be fine. Woima needs a substitute tonight, want to come? - No. There you are. You are so beautiful. How did you like the meal? - It was alright. I thought it was excellent. This is where I live. Do you know how to sneak? - Certainly. Sneak home to yours, then. Allu! - Hi. May I come in? These are for you. - Thank you. What are you reading? - Just Mary Marck. Have a piece, it's delicious. - Thank you. Won't you open your present? It's nothing extraordinary. Smell it. - It' s nice. Landysh, from Russia. It's lily of the valley in Russian. Smells just like it. Actually I came to tell you that I'm going to sea. I don't know how long I'll stay. A year, maybe. When I return, I want us to be together. I want you to wait for me. I can't accept your presents if you say such crazy things. It'll be us two in the end. You'll see. Beloved friends. In memory of our father Rurik. Greetings to our sister in Germany, - as well as our mother in her new marriage in Södermanland. I and my sister Lucie welcome you most cordially. We hope you enjoy yourselves in our Björknäs! Unless Lucie already has mortgaged her share in a fashion house in Paris. You should only know how lucrative fashion is. The smaller the cloth, the higher the price. Cheers! Dear guests, may I introduce: Micki, Maggie, Nita and I. You ought to know that I tried to stop this spectacle. Lucie, Lucie, Lucie, Louise. I do love you, but you never love me too. Eccu, should you not go after Aina? She needs you. Aina, what is it? - Nothing in particular. I have a headache. You just go to the others. - I don't want to leave you alone. Boys, Kiffen and HIFK have weak teams. I've heard the workers' team has good players. Maybe some could be moved from there? - No way. They think the bourgeois sports are unhealthy and only aim for profit. In the same way they are convinced - that Jesus was not Gods' son, - but an extraordinary agitator. Christ, do you ever listen to yourselves? You just have to have all. It's not enough that you own the farms, factories and shops. Even the football players have to be yours. And God forbid if the poor and hungry should try to take something from you. Then you will shoot most of them and put the rest in camps. Change your tone or you can go join the ladies. Oh, little Cedric. And what if I will not obey you? I will not tolerate such behaviour here, Lu. You, who were prisoners, - complained to the consul when the Reds took your cheese off the bread. Later on your enemies had to seek for undigested seeds in their excrement. You know nothing about those things! Quod erat demonstrandum. What are you muttering, Bolshevik? Which is to be demonstrated. Lucie is right. What the hell are you saying? - The Reds were treated too harshly. I completely disagree. Their civil confidence was restored - even though they wanted to kill us all! It is a big lie that they wanted to kill us all. Ivar, you are using the wrong words. We wanted to kill you all - is what you should say. We all know which colour you are deep down. Calm down, Cedi. Cedi. - What? So much happened that spring. We have to talk about it at some point. Talk about what? - Västankvarn, Kumberla. It never happened. We do have something in common. We don't want the party to end. - Maybe so. Next time you want to expand, and need capital, - can you not ask me first, instead of Henning? I have a condition though. You have to photograph me for some hours, and put your soul into it. Good night. - Good night. Sweet dreams. Did I do something wrong? - No, I'll just arrange the lights. I'll arrange my clothes then. - You do that. Come. You can take pictures later. Eccu, put the camera away. I have never felt ugly, - not even as a child with crooked teeth. But I have often felt - faulty. One can be beautiful in the wrong way. You redress me. I did not do it. This is you. You shine. Remember when you wanted to find a new way of seeing? You wanted to leave and discover life. It's not too late. Lucie, I... Lucie, I am sorry that I have not kept in touch, - but the family and work have filled all my time. People like me can find a tolerable existence in everyday life. Would you come to bed? Your refusal to give in is so strong. I doubt you would ever be happy here. Welcome. How was Paris? - Paris is like an overflowing fountain. One has to be a little crazy, especially in Rive Gauche. All the prostitutes in Montparnasse and Montmartre - made a pilgrimage to Saties' funeral a few years back. Imagine all the indignant writings if something like that occurred here. All love is bought. The upper class wives - are nothing but breeders who have not even learned how to enjoy. Excuse me, a pot of tea please. The strong kind, thank you. What on earth? - A negro from Montevideo taught me. Is Mandi going to the games? - You should forget about Mandi. She can't really love that snob from the business school. Allu? - Mandi. You are so beautiful. Weren't you supposed to be somewhere in South America? I changed ships. I wanted home for summer. I dreamed about standing at Kivinokka looking over Helsinki - on an August night as the lights glitter. Only one thing is more beautiful. And then the thing with my mother. - My condolences. I speak English now. And a little Spanish, that's a funny language. I have to go now. I'd invite you in, but Lauri is coming soon. Mandi, you were supposed to wait for me. What did I ever promise you? I don't think you are suited for that Lauri Kanervo anyhow. Who do you think you are? I make my own decisions. At the piano: Robert W. Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, Aurora Premier Brass Band! Lauri? - Yes. Lauri Kanervo? - Yes? Hi, little Hans-Rurik. He has your mouth. But Cedis' character. If he doesn't get what he wants, he screams. Eccu! How is Cedi? He sends his best, and is sorry he could not come. You know he means well. I know him better than you do. Good, then. Shall we sit down? - Yes, please. Lucie! Eccu? - Lucie, beloved Lucie. Eccu! What is haunting you? Sometimes there is light... Everything is - white. Like snow, fresh snow. And you are there and then... But mostly it is dark. It gets dark inside and I - I don't know what to do. Woima! Woima! I must admit that this is much more interesting than I expected. Woima! Woima! What car is that? - Shoo now. Where are you going? Henning Lund, how do you do? I would like to talk to you. I haven't done anything. I'm not political. May I enter? I have seen you play. I am a manager at Helsinki IFK and I have a suggestion: That you play in our team. You would get better jobs, too. - What jobs? Think about it. Come to my office tomorrow afternoon. Good bye. Good day. Has Kajander considered my suggestion? If I play football in this city it will only be for Woima. The usual, please. A cup of coffee, please. Excuse me. - Thank you. You just sit and drink your tea, Aina. I have a headache. You and Cedric always were such good friends. I am worried about you. Everything you touch shatters. You have to learn to let go of the past. Whatever you did, it cannot be undone. Just give me a minute. Hi! - Hello! Let's go. Leave the car here. One has to row to Kivinokka. First you have to see Lemmenniemi, or else it's not right. Come on. Steady on. I forgot to tell that the damn boat is leaky. Scoop on, or we'll both sink. What place is this? We who don't have mansions need some place to be. The Heat rock. Many kids have been conceived here. You know, the Swedish and Finnish students have started walking - on different sides of Esplanadi-street. It is so sad. If one has friends on the other side they're seen as Trojan horses. I mean potential enemies. - I know the meaning. Only rich people can afford to quarrel about such things. Shall we go to The Heat rock? - We don't need to. I have a mansion just for us. Hurry up. You clumsy idiot! The hell! You can get your last wages and leave, Kajander. Hi. - Hi. First we will have a glass. Would you open it? Do you want one? I'm not a damn kept man! Take your champagne and leave. I get it, but I'm just trying to help. - You don't get anything. It's not help that is needed. We need a new society. You're just pretending. You incline your head when you hear about poverty and need. The next moment you just think about going to bed. Everything is just a game for you. You don't understand what true suffering is. Get out. Go! Mandi asked about you. About how you are. Did you know she broke off her engagement? Aina? Aina, where are you? - I will stay at home. But the party at Hennings' pavilion? - You can go alone. That is what you truly want, to drink and whore with your friends. I hate them. Our marriage has failed, and you know it too. I can't match up against Lucie Lilliehjelm. You crave for her. She is just a friend. - Do you think I am stupid? You loved her before we even met. To Louise Lilliehjelm after my death I have tried to forgive you. I just wanted an ordinary life. A few children, - and that there would be some love between us. But such life does not suit you. Dear Eccu. I took Stigu with me to my parents. When we get back, you must have taken your things and moved out. Aina. Over the past twelve years it has felt like we are reconciling bit by bit - despite the horrible memories and deaths. But now evil has returned. They speak of honour and pride, - but they go out on the streets to hate and to persecute. Hernberg. Forsman. Björk. Greetings to the damn Russians! And for example Vikström, Kajander or Virtanen. Kajander? Enok Kajander? - No, Allan. Can I help you, gentlemen? We know what you are doing! We have surrounded you! Don't resist. Come out in peace, and nothing will happen to you. Damn Bolsheviks! We are cowards! The papers take the fascists' side - and brand all the socialists as savages. People are afraid of communism. - Damn, Hanemann. They are afraid of their oppressors. You see? We are winking at the Lapua Movements' crimes! Your duty as chief editor... - I define my own agenda. They are planning a march through the centre of Helsinki. Write about it, then. I'll protect you. Open up, Eccu! What the hell are you staring at? We are your friends. We came to help you. Friends. You have to get straight. Voilà. I'm standing straight. Ergo, get out. What is your problem, Eccu? Why don't you sort out the material? If you do that, I can arrange an exhibition. These are excellent! These are just rubbish. If one has dreamed about a world without walls and a roof, - but then has to tread in this damn swamp... Please leave. No-one is... - Leave already! Looking at the men in the Lapua movement and their sharp look, - you can also see a strong glimpse of lechery and decadence. If you then close your eyes, you can easily see the same faces - powdered and with painted lips, singing a bawdy number - in a genuine Berliner cabaret. That bastard! He makes people laugh at us. Let's teach him a lesson. - Ivar Grandell is not important. Chief editor Hanemann is responsible. - What if we transported him a bit? I know where he is. At the publicists' summer house in the archipelago. Are you coming to the farm to get milk? I'm not finished yet. Are you Hanemann? No, unfortunately. - You are lying. I assure you, I am not Hanemann. - Search the house. Cedi? - We know that Hanemann is here. Is this Grandell? - Put down the revolver. Ivar, we are being serious. Where is Hanemann? We got a catch. It was this joker who wrote that we look like clowns. Lets take him for a little ride. - For the last time, where is he? He is not here. Look closely. The inside of this sack is the last thing you will see. And this will be your last journey. You dogs! Don't shoot! Is it the sub-editor? My call concerns Ivar Grandell. He is on the Pikku-Noita island. There now. All is well. Should I report them? - But is it to any use? They were looking for you. - We will just let it be. Good day. - Good day. Excuse me, I did not sleep much tonight. The Ostrobothnians will walk in front. We'll join them. President Relander and Mannerheim will welcome us at the Great Square. See you on the Boulevard in 20 minutes. I don't want you to end up in prison. - If we don't resist - they will crush us all. I promise to be careful. It was you who said that we'll be together eventually. I'm sorry Mandi. Forgive me. Father, why are you sitting on the floor? Forgive me. Welcome. - Thank you. Runeberg's cakes. - Thank you. There is one for Henrik too. - He is not at home, but he'll be soon. Stigu! Come see who came. He's been expecting you. Now say good day. - Good day. Well, good day. A small birthday present. What did you wish for the most? - Skates. Father said it's better to buy new. - Thank properly now. Thank you. I don't need this anymore. Maybe you'll take an interest some day. Come on, I'll show you how it works. Like this. Then... - Like this? Excuse me, may I sit? How nice to see you. You look very healthy. I'm glad to see you. - I had planned to look you up. Sometimes I think things would have been different if I had you. It's like I did not want to do everything I did, - but I did it anyhow and everything just got worse. There is so much light in you, Lucie. - You might see me that way. But I don't always feel like it. You always followed your dreams. - I have no regrets. But I am lonely. I'm planning on moving to Paris. Would you go with me? We two have always understood each other. It's not too late. But the darkness, Lucie. I cannot help it. I'll write to you right away. Promise that you'll write back. Did you hear about Kajander? The footballer. He will go to Court Martial. - Why? For spreading leaflets. - One should have guessed. He refused to play for other than worker's teams. They say he even helped Russian paratroopers to hide. There is only one punishment for his kind. I wanted you to know that I want to help. Petition for a pardon. So what? They want me dead. We have applied for a postponement for a new discretion. Do you remember Henning Lund? He has connections. You are as helpful and self-sacrificing as always. You don't need to be disparaging towards me. I know you mean well. I'm just not used to that. It's not worth it. I don't want you to trample me again. Maybe you could do it for Mandi's sake, or your son's. Is pride more important than life? Translation: Maria Wiren-Malo
