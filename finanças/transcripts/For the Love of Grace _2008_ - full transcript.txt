[MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. Jane. The craziest thing is happening out there. All these people hanging around in formal attire waiting for something interesting to happen. So any chance of getting you married today? Yeah. I'm almost-- You just paid someone $300 to do your makeup. Well, what do I do? What am I going to do? Take a deep breath. It's still there. OK. I can fix that thing. You can? When have I ever let you down? There was that time that you left me alone in our tent with that crazy squirrel. We were Girl Scouts, Jen. Nine years old. [FIRE TRUCKING BEEPING] Nice work, Betsy. You rest now. Steve, find your brother a date. Please. No one comes between a man and his truck, Murph. Lockwood, what the hell were you thinking out there today? No time to wait for a ladder, captain. Besides, I can climb faster myself. You could also get yourself killed. Don't let it happen again. JEN: It's hopeless. You are speaking to the author of the trade paperback "Makeup Disasters"-- --"And Their Solutions." Grace, it's getting bigger. Do you think it's a sign that I shouldn't get married? You know you love him. And you're perfect for each other. It's just the wedding day jitters. I promise. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] Are you planning on turning that off, you know, at the alter? Oh, at least until you get the ring on your finger. Then everyone can watch my flying thumbs. Ready? What about the blotch? It's gone. Now, can we please get you married? You saved my life. I look forward to returning the favor on your wedding day. First things first. Oh. Morning, Grace. Michelle, you're back. How was Miami? So cool. I mean hot. It was awesome. I'm completely over old what's-his-name. You're a new woman. Totally. The trip actually gave me a great idea for my next book, "Getting Over a Bad Break-up. 10 Steps to Picking Up the Pieces and Finding the New You." Do you like it? As long as the title's not longer than the book, I like it. Good morning, Alicia. Good morning, Grace. And uh, what are you working on? I'm proofing a copy of "Gardening in Small Spaces," finishing my first draft of "Knitting for New Moms," and I'm weighing two new ideas-- "Plan Perfect Parties" or a sequel to "The Organized Abode" called "The Organized Workplace." Slacker. "Organized Workplace." Sequels are always a good bet. I'll have something for you tomorrow. I look forward to it. [KNOCKING] CLIFF: It's me. It's open. Hey, guess where I'm going. Sorry. Had to finish that thought. Irises. Going somewhere? Albuquerque. They want me to fly out Monday. Cliff, that's great news. I am going to close the deal on this Bidwell account. I can feel it. You know, if I land this-- When you land it. When I land it, Grace, it's going to be big, huge. Oh, it's going to be so good for us. House in Kensington, here we come. Yeah. So what are you working on? My sequel to "The Organized Abode," "The Organized Workplace." Sequels sell. Alicia was intrigued. But my pitch has to be perfect. Don't forget organized. So where are the happy newlyweds? They closed the Second Avenue Bridge, and their GPS rerouted them through a Polish street festival. Oh. Maybe they stopped for a kielbasa. I hope not, because I'm serving an exceptional Thai dinner. Wow. When's the last time we had dinner with Jen and Bill? Hm. The wedding reception. No. Yes. That was seven weeks ago. How could that be? We're busy. As honeybees, honey. [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh. That's probably them. No. That's my exceptional Thai dinner. [WEATHER REPORT ON TV] Hey, Vic's setting up that playoff pool again. You in? No thanks. Come on. You won last year. You got to defend your title. Frank, I said no thanks. Mom called while you were in the shower. Dad went in for his annual physical. The doctor called him overweight. He was deeply offended. Well, maybe Dad should use that treadmill we bought him for something other than a coat rack. Look. We got to get a move on. The captain says he wants to talk to me tonight. Talk? You know what that means. Arizona is amazing. The whitewater rafting. That was like the highlight. You guys, you have to come with us next time. Oh, whitewater. Well, you all know that I like blue water. Well, then you should come with us to the Bahamas next spring. I don't know. I have three books due before summer. So, um, have you guys set a date yet? Well, we have a two-year plan. Two-year plan? Well, that's spontaneous. Well, the first year we're concentrating on our jobs. And the second year we're going to work on the wedding and the house. BILL: Well, sounds like a plan. Yeah. Speaking of plans, we have some exciting news. Oh, Jen. That's so fast. Why? We've been looking for houses for over a year now. A house. Congratulations. Where? Saint James Village. Oh. You're staying in town. Mhm. It's a real family neighborhood. They've got great schools. Just interesting people. That beautiful park right next door. [PHONE RINGING] It's like-- [PHONE RINGING] It's like-- it's-- Sorry. Like a small, little town tucked inside a big city, you know. Well, I mean you guys know, right. You're looking in the same area. Cliff and I are thinking about buying in Kensington. Ho ho. Cha-ching. Yeah. That's so far out of town. Here I thought you'd liked Saint James Village. Can you two afford Kensington? Well, that's why we're both working overtime. Is it worth it? Kensington? It's a great investment. Oh, Grace, I mean you're already working so hard. I hardly ever see you. Well, we work in the same office. Exactly. Well, we're seeing each other right now, aren't we? Yes. Yes, we are. FIREMAN: Yeah, I hope you washed your hands. MURPH: Well, well, if it isn't Mr. Lockwood and his crazy kid brother. Call me anything. Just don't call me late for dinner. Wat are you making there, Murph? Meatloaf there, Frank. Looks good. MURPH: Actually, it's lacking a little something. I was hoping maybe the Iron Chef could help. How about it, Steve? Ah, I'm good, Murph. I already ate. Thanks. Is he cooking at home? Nothing that reminds him of her. I thought we were here to save lives. You knew the floor was hot. You knew time was running out. You went back in. You never go back in without your partner. It was my decision. Come on, Steve. You're treating this like it's some kind of solo act. First that thing without the ladder. Then the jump between the buildings. And now this. What if the floor gave out, huh? Not only would you be dead, I could have lost every man that I sent back in there to get you. Well? I'm sorry. No you're not. No you're not, or you wouldn't keep doing it. All right. Look, Steve. I respect you. I do. Every single man in this firehouse, they respect you. But this is crazy cowboy stuff. You put every one of our lives in danger. Is that what you want? No. I already know what it's like to lose a man. I don't want to lose another one. Steve, you need help. I'm not seeing a shrink. CAPTAIN: Well, I can't let this behavior slide. It's not going to help you. It's not going to help this firehouse. You're suspended until further notice. JEN: I can't believe I finally dragged you here. That's a clogged artery waiting to happen. Maybe. But this girl is celebrating. Really? What? No longer having to fit into my wedding dress. OK. Vegetables aren't really their specialty. Want a bite? No thanks. Just as well. I came here to work. Does that thing ever run out of batteries? Never. You know I hate missing calls, especially at a business lunch. Finished? Mm. This burger is so good. Not as good as the ones your dad used to make though. Hey, our place has a grill. When are you coming by? It's a busy time. You know my workload, Jen. OK. So what have you got? How about "Best Regional Wineries." It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it. Maybe. It'll take a while to write though. Yeah. You going to eat that? No. And let's doggie bag it. I want to get going. We just got here. Frank, you're a terrific brother. You really are. You're the best. I'm your only brother. And I appreciate what you're trying to do. I really do. -Appreciate what? You're trying to cheer me up. Hey, I only brought you along to increase my chances of meeting girls. And I told you, I'm not ready. Come on. We got prospects. 12 o'clock. Since when have you chased women? I chase plenty of women. I just don't know what to do when I catch them. Hey, your kid brother takes you out to your favorite dinner. Oh, so you're picking up the tab. I was speaking hypothetically. Come on. At the very least, you can watch me humiliate myself. That'll do. OK. JEN: Like we're getting totally smashed all the time. Excuse me, ladies. I just wanted you to know that there's a celebrity in house. I'm sorry. Is it you? I don't recognize you. No. It's my brother, Steve. Firefighter of the Year 2007. Best repeller in Firehouse 22. JEN: Gee. I would have pegged you as the best repeller. [CELL PHONE RINGS] My interview. Hello. Well. Now, that we got rid of those two. That's nice. Because you're an organizational expert and my book could use your expertise. Yes. I recorded your morning show appearance, but I have my own questions. I'll be there. Thank you, Mr. Turst. Thank you so much. Oh. Sorry. I never know what to do in these situations. I mean do you stop? Step aside? Go the other way? Go the original way? Yes. Yes. To what? You go the original as planned. Great. Except I don't remember my original way. Wow. That's quite the Harley Fat Boy you got there. Nothing like the rumble of a V-Twin. No. That's not mine. You know bikes? I know a lot of things. That didn't sound good, did it? I write how to books. Hey. Where did you go, Steve? You left me hanging out to-- oh. I should go. I should go. Finally found this. Hey, your lucky charm. Brought it in as a rookie. A lot of good it did me. So that girl from Maloney's. She-- she kind had something, didn't she? Yeah. She had a diamond ring on her finger. You noticed. That means you're interested. No. I'm not. Well, you got to rip the bandage off sometime. Will you let it go, Frank? No, I won't let it go, Steve. I'm worried about you. And I don't like worrying. Worrying is the older brother's job. What the hell do you want me to do? Maybe take your own ring off. Ow. Back off. Look, Steve, I miss Molly too, but she's gone. And you're still here. And I need you to want to be here. Molly would have wanted that too. I'll see you at home. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. CLIFF (ON PHONE): Hi. Hey, honey. CLIFF (ON PHONE): Just calling to say good night. Aren't you sweet. How's the hotel? CLIFF (ON PHONE): The room service is hideous. What'd you have for lunch? Jen and I did a working lunch at Copper's. CLIFF (ON PHONE): Copper's? That grease pit. I had a salad. Well, a reasonable facsimile. Did you get a hold of the mortgage broker yet? CLIFF (ON PHONE): Yeah. It's on my to do list. I'm pretty sure we're going to have the rest of our down payment soon. I got an interview with that organizational expert. CLIFF (ON PHONE): Oh. Fantastic. When? Tomorrow. 3 o'clock. CLIFF (ON PHONE): Wow. I've got my presentation tomorrow. Also 3:00. I'll send you good luck vibes. CLIFF (ON PHONE): Ditto. Listen. If both these-- When they both click. CLIFF (ON PHONE): Right. We better get some rest. You know I love you. I love you too. Good night, Cliff. CLIFF (ON PHONE): Good night. [FIRE ALARM BLARING] Oh my god. [COUGHING] Help! Help! Come on. Wake up. Wake up. Can you hear me? Come on. Don't leave me. Come on. Wake up. All right. Take this. Now hold it there. I'm going to get you out here. Stay with me. I'm going to get you out of here. Stay with me. [SIRENS BLARING] Shh. You're going to be just fine. You need to rest now. All right. Shh. OK. There you go. Rest. How's she doing? Sir, there's no visiting now. Oh no. I was the guy who brought her in. Oh, the fireman. Yeah. Oh. Is she going to be OK? I mean she was unconscious when I found her. Well, we're going to have to wait and see. I mean she responded well to the brochodilators, but now there's a possibility of fluid in her lungs. I, um, I brought her a sweater. I'll give it to her. You will. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Good morning, Grace. There was a fire. Yeah. That's right. You are one lucky girl. How did I get here? Somebody saw the smoke and pulled you out of there. Who? An off duty fireman from Firehouse 22. Like I say, you are one lucky girl. Hey. Cliff. Grace, how you feeling? I feel OK, but I could feel a lot better. Well, yeah. How long have you been here? Oh, I flew here as soon as the hospital gave me the news. But your presentation. It can wait. Let's just concentrate on getting you out of here. OK. Hopefully, you won't have to stay here that long. What's in there? That was all they were able to recover from the fire. In this one little box? CLIFF: Yeah. That's everything. Not quite. I'm still here. And I replaced your laptop. All your files from your office computer already loaded. Thank you. CLIFF: And that organizational expert is waiting to hear from you when you're ready to go back to work. Who's ready for a serious upgrade from hospital food? Spinach salad? Mhm. You need your iron. You know, Grace, I've been thinking. Let's pick a wedding date. What about our two-year plan? Plans change. When did you decide this? Sitting in the hospital that first night, hoping with all my heart that you'd get better. I realized I almost lost you once. I'm never going to let that happen again. When? When? Well, you know, I'm working on the Bidwell deal for a while, so-- Is there a Saturday in April? Oh, no. April won't work if the deal happens-- when it happens. No. May 13th I have the Scranton, and then we're getting close to Memorial Day. So. Early May? What's wrong with May 7th? Nothing at all. May 7th. Great. I'll call the church. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Hey. I'll be right down. [ELEVATOR DINGS] Jen. Grace, thank goodness you're OK. OK. I can't breathe. I'm just so happy to see you. Bill and I came and visited you at the hospital, but you were pretty out of it. Cliff said we should just wait until you recovered. I'm recovered. You look great. You look like your old self-- your young old self. GRACE: So did you pitch Alicia your regional wineries book? She loved it. Bill couldn't be happier too. We're just going to spend a lot of time together checking out wineries. Ah. On the company's dime too. Life couldn't be better. I'm a happily married woman. My best friend didn't die in a fire. How's Cliff? Busy. I bet. We set a wedding date. Oh my god. When? May 7th. I can't wait to get started. As your maid of honor I have some really good-- am I your maid of honor? Come on. That's a silly question. What is it? I found this old picture of me and my dad. It was one of the few things that survived the fire. Honey. He's not going to be there to walk me down the aisle or-- sorry. I'm a little emotional. You have nothing to apologize for. You want to go back to your room. I think I'll go the firehouse and thank the fireman who saved my life. Good idea. MURPH: Frank, you know that guy Moose from Division 52? FRANK: Yeah. MURPH: Seven hoagies in one sitting. FRANK: And then like a whole bottle of Pepto. MURPH: It's disgusting. FRANK: Is his name Moose, or is he actually a moose? MURPH: I think he is an actual moose. Hello. Hi. MURPH: Can I help you? GRACE: I'm looking for Steve Lockwood. He's not here right now, but-- I'm Steve's brother, Frank. Have we met? At Copper's. A few weeks ago. Oh. That's it. It's nice to see you again. Nice to be here. Right after that, I nearly died in a fire. What? Where? Stanhope Place. MURPH: Stanhope Place. That was a bad one. That was my house. I'm so sorry. At least you're OK. Thanks to your brother. Anyway, I came by to thank him. I'll leave him this, and maybe I'll write him a note. All right. I'll make sure he gets it. Hey. Come on. Watch the lady. That's a really nice camera. What are you, like a photographer or something? No. No. I-- it was one of the few things that survived the fire. FRANK: Hey, get a shot of this. The Manning brothers got nothing on me. OK. You got my good side. You ready? You can delete that right now. Please. Great. MURPH: Here's your picture. Right here. See this is the most beautiful hoagie in the world. FRANK: Hey, sit down and have a hoagie with us. Oh no. I should go. Are you sure? You will love it. Trust me. Miss? Harlen. Grace Harlen. Well, Miss Harlen. Please. Another hoagie, boys. Have a seat. So I guess your brother was off duty that night. Actually, he was suspended. Suspended? Yeah. He's been going through some stuff. His wife passed away. Oh. Must be really hard. FRANK: Yeah. Maybe you want to call him. You know, thank him over the phone. Sure. Maybe he'll realize how much he's needed around here. Maybe even make him feel better about himself. I know I'd appreciate it. I'd be happy to call him. Dinner is served. Thank you. ANNOUNCER (ON TV): And now a long birdie putt to take control of this match and hand the lead outright to Robinson. Looking for an assist toward championship-- Honey, I'm home. I got leftovers. ANNOUNCER (ON TV): It looked like it was going to go center but it would just turn right into-- Come on, Steve. Let's eat at the table like civilized people. All right. Any calls today? Maybe. Well, you might want to start answering your phone. I gave your number to that woman you pulled from the Stanhope Place. She came by today to thank you. And now she wants to call me? She wants to thank you properly in person probably. Well, I think it's great that she's OK, but it's not necessary. You should meet her. She's cool. She's engaged. She might have a friend. I'm not interested in dating right now. How many times do I have to tell you? I meant a friend for me. Bite my head off why don't you? She wants to thank you for saving her life. Is that so terrible? CLIFF: Yep. Yep. OK. No problem. Smile. You didn't smile. It's because I have to fly to Washington tonight. Tonight? Well, that gives us plenty of time for a walk. Walk? Where to? Nowhere. Just a walk. Or we could go somewhere. How about the park? Park? You know, it's kind of chilly outside. Well, bundle up. It'll be nice. And I can take some pictures. Pictures? Pictures of what? I don't know. Birds. Trees. Whatever we see. Maybe I'll take some of you. OK. But Grace, when did you take up photography anyway? I was 10, I think. I told you that. My picture of that prize pumpkin that ran in the school paper. Prize pumpkin. I have to go and pack. Oh, it doesn't take you all day to pack. No. Prepare. They want me to meet the CFO for drinks tonight. OK. Before you go, let's pick a day when we can go to Jen and Bill's house to visit. -That's going to be hard. It's not hard. You just pick a day and then you don't plan anything else for that day. Except I have no idea when I'm coming back from Washington. And well, when I get back, you know how tight our schedules are. I'm sorry. I have to go. I'll call you. Bye. [MUSIC EASILY AMUSED, "ONLY A GIRL"] I went ahead and ordered. I had them hold yours. I'm starving. A burger? Does Cliff know that you're cheating on his tofu? Yes. He's fine with it-- ish. How's work? Alicia's cracking the whip. When are you coming back? Monday. You're going to walk in with three perfect pitches and you'll put all the rest of us to shame. Thanks. I'll have a beer. This burger is grilled to perfection. How's Bill? How's the house? Good. We love it. We spent last night finishing a bottle of wine and enjoying the twilight colors. I want to visit soon. Well, check with Cliff's schedule and let me know. My schedule's wide open, and I'd really love to see the place. You would? Why wouldn't I? Last time you didn't seem so interested. Well, I'm interested now. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] Look at you. What? You remind me of the girl I grew up with. You know I keep going over that night in my mind. How close I came. If it wasn't for that firefighter. Did you get to thank him? No. He wasn't there. His younger brother was. He was the one who wanted us to meet a celebrity. Firefighter of the year. Yeah. What a line. Actually, it's true. His brother said he's having a rough time right now and I had to call him but-- Do it. Come on. The guy saved your life. Maybe he doesn't want some-- Please. Every man wants to be told that he's a hero. Good to have you here, Grace. It's good to be here. [PHONE RINGING] FRANK (RECORDING): Hey, this is Steve and Frank. We're brothers, and we're out. GRACE (ON PHONE): Um. Hi. Steve? Or Frank. Are you there? [TOILET FLUSHING] GRACE (ON PHONE): Its Grace Harlen. Fire at Stanhope Place. Hello. Hello. GRACE (ON PHONE): Hey. Hey. GRACE (ON PHONE): I was hoping to talk to Steve. Hey, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's right here. Just a second. That's the quickest I've ever seen you move. Just talk to her, will you? Hello. Hi. Steve? It's Grace Harlen. From the fire at the townhouse on Stanhope. Hi. Hi. I'm calling because I wanted to say how grateful I am to you for being there and for, you know, saving my life. Well, that's my job. Can I thank you in person? Big ketchup guy myself. Hey. Hi. I'm so glad you came. Yeah. GRACE: Yes. Oh. I ordered this for you. Oh. And dinner's on me. Wow. I should save your life more often. Just a small token of my appreciation. It's not every person who would risk his life for a complete stranger. So thank you for my second chance. Sure. To not being dead. Oh god what'd I just say. No, it's OK. No. It's not. No. It is. My brother said I should get out of the house more. See friends. It's OK. He just wants you to be happy. But what's happy? Pretty relative term, especially after what you've been through. It sounds like you know from experience. My dad. He was there for me every day of my life. And then one day, he wasn't anymore. And then, everything changed. Maybe I should get some more fries to go with my ketchup. Yeah. Excuse me. Can I get some more fries please? So are you a typical firemen, an adrenaline junkie? That's a bit of a stereotype. So you don't go skydiving, bungee jumping, rock climbing, bull riding? No. No. And definitely no. Motorcycling? I knew it. I knew it. The way you were looking at that Harley outside. Now, why do you know so much about bikes? Oh. I wrote a book two years ago. "Motorcycle Maintenance for Novices." Well, my bike definitely needs a tune-up. You should get it going again. WAITRESS: There you go. Thank you. I'm starving. Oh, wait. Oh yeah. Ah. Yeah. It's good to have you back, Grace. Thanks, Alicia. Thanks to all of you for the emails, all the flowers. All right. Let's cut right to it. Pitch me your next bestseller. I, uh, I don't have a pitch ready. Oh. OK. Where are we on "The Organized Workplace"? It's been tough getting beyond the shelving chapter. ALICIA: I'm surprised to hear that. Well, this is your first day back. Can you have a pitch ready for next week? What have you got for us, Michelle? Well, "Getting Over a Bad Break-up." And what's the angle? I'm going to interview different women who've gone through difficult break-ups. See how they coped. Sob stories? No. This is inspirational. Like for example, when my boyfriend broke up with me, I nearly died, but I went to Miami and found that the change of scenery, the new people, the new experiences, it just revived me in a way. So this book is going to be about positive change and how something new can just give you a new lease on life. I'm pleased that you're drawing on your personal experience this time, Michelle. This sounds like one from the heart. And that is what separates the good books from the great ones. Hey, Michelle. Yeah. Good pitch. Thanks. Let me know if I can help you with yours. Are you still open to, um, new experiences? Such as? Dating. Something casual would be OK. Maybe you can help me with a different project. Hey, you brought out the bike. Yeah, well, she needs a lot of work. Can you hand me the 3/8 please? Sure. Whoa. You know they say you can judge a man by how he takes care of his tools. Brother, you're a mess. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hi, Grace. Stop me if this is out of line, but-- But what? GRACE (ON PHONE): I was just thinking that if you ever wanted to go on a date I know this girl at work. Ah. Girl at work. She's young, cute. Not serious. She's like the anti-me. STEVE (ON PHONE): You say it like it's a good thing. I just thought it might be fun. You know, I'm not much for setups. You could just go for a drink. Why not? Tonight at Copper's. Michelle will meet you at 5:00. OK. OK. It's a date. Don't hang up. Is Frank there? I need to ask him something. Uh. Let me see if I can find him. FRANK (ON PHONE): Hello. Bill and I are looking at carpet swatches that day. You can come with us, but it's not as interesting as it sounds. Then can I come by and see the house Sunday instead? Yeah. That'd be fantastic. So how's the sequel coming? It's not. I scrapped it. Grace. I've got something else cooking. Does Alicia know? Not yet. But I'm taking her advice. This one is from the heart. I got to go. Where? Steve? Michelle. Hi. How are you? Good. Did you want to grab a table? Sure. OK. A book? Stories of the people who save our lives. Think you can convince your captain this is a good idea? Well, you helped my brother out. The least I can do is return the favor. Thanks. What is that smell? Hey, I shower daily. No. It smells amazing. Well, you came by just in time for dinner. After you. Do you like live bands, going to concerts? Depends on who it is, I guess. Well, what kind of music do you like? Do you like punk? Wow. You ask a lot of questions huh. Sorry. Occupational hazard of being a writer, I guess. Wow. A fireman. That sounds like an awesome job. It has its moments. Mine too. The fun part is everything is research. Like this one time, I worked on this book about tattoos, and so I got one on the small of my back and my parents freaked. Did you want to see it. No. I'm good. Maybe some other time. You know, there's this band called Aztec Wheel that plays at a club near here. Did you maybe want to check them out later? No. Michelle, listen. I'm sorry. Um. You really are great. You're fantastic. It's me. I can't do this. I'm not-- I'm not ready. I'll take care of the drinks. OK. I'm sorry. Hey. Incredible. Yeah. Firemen have a lot of downtime, so most of us learn to cook. Most of us. Water burner. The Lockwood with all the culinary talent is Steve. He is the best chef this firehouse has ever seen. Must be nice living with a chef. Except he doesn't cook these days. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Go ahead. Hey, Michelle. How's your date? What date? He left. Already? We didn't really click. Kind of reminded me of my older brother. I'm sorry it didn't work out. Ah. It's no problem. I'm off to see my favorite band. It was a bust. Wasn't it? It's my fault. I was trying to help him, and I made things worse. Ha. Now, you know how I feel. Should I go to your place. Talk to him. Or would that add insult to injury? He's not there. I probably shouldn't be telling you this. GRACE: Hi. Hey, Grace. Frank told me I find you here at the soup kitchen. I hope that's OK. It'd be better if you rolled up your sleeves. You know I was-- I was kidding. No. I-- I want to help. Yeah. I've noticed. Michelle. She's very sweet, very inquisitive. Sorry. No. She was fine. It was me. No. You can leave that there. That's for Jonesy. He, uh, gets a little anxious about the crowds, so he comes back later to eat. Do you volunteer a lot? It's my first week back. Uh, Molly and I, we volunteered here every week for three years. I used to help at the animal shelter. But when my dad died and my career kicked in, I just never find the time. You got to make time. I know. I'm learning that more and more, ever since the fire. Oh. Oh, sorry. Oh, it's OK. A little dishwater never hurt anybody. I have to thank you for something. Uh-oh. I don't know if I can accept another one of your thank yous. When I first went to the firehouse to find you, I was so inspired by the place that it gave me a new idea for a book. So thank you. You're welcome. I guess. You know they really miss you at the station. Yeah. I don't know when I'm going back. You could stop by for a visit. I guess so. They've got dirty dishes too. So you got it working. So far so good. How long have you had it? My parents gave it to us for our wedding gift. Cool parents. Yeah. They're big into bikes. Your parents are still together? Over 40 years. Wow. How do they do it? They're always planning their next vacation, skiing, golfing. They're best friends. They're meant for each other. Sounds like they make every day a new beginning. You want to hop on? [CELL PHONE RINGING] That was Cliff. My fiance. Oh yeah. Well, I'll see you later, Steve. See you later. Sorry I'm late. Never too late to start celebrating. GRACE: What are we celebrating? Bidwell account. Signed, sealed, and delivered. Cliff, why didn't you tell me on the phone? Because I wanted to tell you in person. I thought it was a special, special occasion. Be careful of the shirt. It's just water. Actually, it's Egyptian cotton. I'm so happy for you, Cliff. There we go. A little toast. There we go. To us. To our future. Maybe now we can go to the Bahamas with Jen and Bill. What? I probably won't have time. I thought you said the Bidwell stuff was over. No. We landed the account. Yeah. The real work's just beginning. Certainly for the next few weeks once we get it up to speed by May. Oh, and May we're getting married, so there's our honeymoon to think about, right. I guess you're right. Yeah. It's not like you to be late. I was helping out at the soup kitchen down the street. Oh. Why? Why? Because it feels good to help people who really need it. You can always give them money. Probably go a lot further, give you time to do things important. Feeding the homeless is important. Yeah. Sure. How's the book going, Grace? I dropped it. I'm going to do something on firefighters. I just need an angle. Grace, you said that "The Organized Workplace" was a moneymaker. This book is going to sell too. But doesn't it take a lot more time to start from square one? It's going to sell even more. Look at these pictures. When these guys aren't saving lives, they cook these elaborate meals together. Mm. Kitchen looks a little communal. "The Ladder Company Cookbook." Recipes and stories from a firehouse. These men are passionate, fun, and funny. The firehouse is so full of energy and life. Even though they deal with tragedy, they somehow come together to make these meals and celebrate life. This is not your usual standard fare. It's not my standard fare. I'm raising my standards. Alicia, this book may take me a little longer to write, but it's something I have to do. You have a lot of passion for this project. Go for it. I'll look forward to seeing it. So what do you think, Captain? Miss Harlen, it's a good idea. It'll also be good for company morale. It's a shame Steve Lockwood can't be a part of this book. I hear he's a great cook. He's a great fireman too. He just needs time to uh-- he just needs some time before he can come back to this firehouse and help this community again. He never stopped helping the community. He's been volunteering at the South Street soup kitchen. It's that so? Wow. Jesus. He hasn't done that for a long time. And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't be doing this project or any project. He saved my life. I brought you your favorite flowers. You know I remember dropping you off at your apartment after our first date, and I said, "goodbye, Molly." And you told me I shouldn't say goodbye because it suggests that we were never going to see each other again. You told me to say "see you soon" instead. And we never said goodbye. We always said "see you soon." I'm sorry I haven't visited Molly. I didn't want to say goodbye. You going to work today? Yeah. I got an afternoon shift. I'm going to come with you. I want to say hi to the guys. Grace? Hey, you ready? I'm double parked. Hey, Jen. It's still warm, Jonesy. Enjoy. Grace Harlen? It's my new layered look. I think you look fantastic without your laptop. So you blew off work to work at a soup kitchen. It's not work. Just a little time. What's up? People need more than soup. They need someone to take the time to stop and really see them. Well, I see you, and I like what I see. Hey. It's so good to have you back. What do you mean? You're like you were before your dad died. I felt so helpless and lonely when he died. That's why I threw myself into my work. I know. Since the fire, I've felt different like so many things that didn't really matter got burned away. Does that make sense? Mhm. Makes a lot of sense. You ready for the heat? Ready for the action? Right here, buddy. Get in here. Hey, the prodigal firefighter returns. Hey, guys. It's good to see you, Steve. I'll take one of those. All right. I'm going to take one to the captain. Yeah. You do that. Nice suit. We love you. Want to toss the ball? Yeah. Sure. Right on. Go long. CAPTAIN: Oh. Oh good. All right. I love you too, sweetie. Bye bye. Hey, captain. I got you a double double with milk, courtesy of Steve. Ah. Thanks. What's with the suit? Oh. Uh. Well, Steve and I were just visiting Molly's grave. Really? How about that? He's just downstairs saying hi to the guys if you want to-- [ALARM BLARING] Oh jeez. Clear. What's the situation? Some kids were fooling around in the old Coalmount Hotel. One slipped down the old elevator shaft. Now, he's seriously hurt, and he's trapped. Ah jeez. We're going to need our best repeller on this one. You two. Move it. Lockwood. Can I trust you? Yes, sir. You can. All right. Get your stuff. Yes, sir. [INAUDIBLE] to dispatch. We are on route. ETA one minute. [HORN HONKING] What have we got? FIREMAN: Well, the stairs collapsed. We got kids trapped inside parking level four or five. We're not sure. All right. Listen up. A couple of kids messing around on the staircase in there. The thing gives out. Drops one of the boys down to he thinks parking level four or five. The only way to get there-- the staircase is history-- through the lobby here. Down the elevator shaft. Got it? Let's rope us a calf, Steve. Do it. All right. Hurry up. JOSH: Help! I can't move. I'm hurt. Please, somebody, help! STEVE: Hang on, buddy. We're coming. All right. Let's make these two beams the anchor right over here. When you're done, I want that shackle right here, right where I'm standing. Right there. Here. I want you to saw off this section right here from here to here. All right. Get on it. Where's that anchor? Let's go. Let's go. Bring it over here. Here we go. Secure? Yes, sir. You be safe down there. Yes, sir. No cowboy stuff. All right. Good. I'm going to drop the rope down now. OK. Three, two, one. Easy. All right, kid. I'm coming down. All right, buddy. Almost there. What's your name? It's Josh. All right. Josh, tell me. Can you move your legs? Yeah. My ankle's killing me. But you can feel it? Yeah. That's good. That's good. All right, just relax. I'm almost there. Get the basket in here. Get the basket! All right, cap. Send it down. Put it out. All right, buddy. Stay out of elevator shafts. All right. Yeah. Thanks, captain. All right. Here we go. To another successful rescue. GROUP: Here, here. And to the return of the better Lockwood brother. Ooh. Also, here's to our team, to our family, back together again. And to our newest member. Me? You're one of us now, Grace. Ladder company 22. GROUP: 22! 22. The thing I don't get is how you got to the scene so fast. Do the two of you have some kind of psychic connection or something like that? Actually, I borrowed a short wave radio so I could get pictures of you guys in action. Smart. So Jonesy told me you've been down at the soup kitchen a few times, huh. I really like it there. That place could use a rescue too. The owner's jacking up the rent. We're going to do a fundraiser here, but I don't know how much longer that place can hold out. Is there something I can do? Maybe. You're the expert at helping people out. I'm no expert. You helped me a lot. I have? Yeah. Well, I should go. Why? Cliff and I have plans. But you're coming back, right? I mean for the book. Definitely. For the book. OK. GRACE: I expected the whole experience to be exciting, but not, you know, exhilarating. Well, I just hope you weren't too close to the scene. No. I was way back. I think living in a hotel room is making you loopy. What do you say we go house hunting in Kensington. GRACE: Right now. I'm in my pajamas. Grace. Grace, come look at this. Come here. Come here. Open house tomorrow. Quiet cul-de-sac. Huge lot. Private setting. What do you think? I hope it's not too private. Our kids won't have anyone to play with. Oh. They'll play with the other kids at school and the nanny. The nanny? Yeah. The nanny. Unless you're planning on staying at home. I hadn't thought of that. Yeah. Maybe. You mean work from home, right? I want to be there for our kids. We'd lose a lot of income. We need to be realistic about this. I don't even know why we're arguing. We're what? Four years away from having kids anyway. If we're going to be realistic about it, that house isn't even in our price range. But you said the fireman's cookbook is sure fire. Yes, but I'm donating half the proceeds to the soup kitchen. What? With the money from the book, they could not only survive, they could thrive. But what about our survival? Cliff, I don't exactly see us out on the street corner panhandling. What do you see for us? Kensington's very nice. But maybe we could find something closer in this neighborhood maybe. Hey. I thought the captain said you could come back without all the baggage. Fine. Then I guess he's not hungry. He's back. Hey. Hey. How's it going? Not bad. I'm just a little out of practice. Hey, I got these for the table. But I want you to take them home later. Sunflowers. Yeah, my dad said sunflowers always make a woman smile. But I think it was my mom who told him. Your parents seem very wise. Yeah. You-- you two plan on having kids. Yeah. In a few years. You know, I saw a sign outside a toy shop once that said, "don't postpone the joy." If you know what I mean. That smells like Heaven. Yeah. You want to try it? No. I don't want to ruin the surprise. Oh come on. I need an objective opinion. It's a little warm. Mm. That may be the best thing I've ever tasted. Yeah? Just wait til you see how it works with the homemade pasta. Wow. [CLEARING THROAT] Hey. Sauce is going to be ready in about five minutes. OK. All right. I'm ready. I'm wearing elastic band pants. Grace, pass me the salt please. Oh. I've never been so full in my life. We may have to pump Frank's stomach. Thanks for letting me photocopy your recipe book. You guard that with your life. Chicken cacciatore. You gave it four stars. Is it that good? Yeah. It was actually Molly's favorite. In fact, that was last thing I ever made her. The night of the accident. Oh. STEVE: Yeah. For dinner, I went to work on the night shift, and she went to go visit her parents. I was actually on call when the dispatch came over. Three car pile-up. You know, I had the weirdest feeling. Something told me it was her. I got there as fast as I could, but it was too late. Sounds like you did everything you possibly could. See that's the thing I-- it's my job. I save people's lives. It's what I do. And I couldn't save the most important person in my life. Think of all the ones you have saved, like me. Well, I will get this book messengered back to you tomorrow. You're going to messenger it? I'm pretty much through the book. I've got all the pictures I need. Plenty of interviews. You didn't get mine. Maybe because I feel like I know you so well already. Once we get an idea of the numbers, then we can talk seating plan, and, uh, your dress alterations will be done on Wednesday, so we don't have to worry about that anymore. So flowers. You got any ideas? Grace? What? Flowers? Flowers. Flowers are nice. Sorry. I'm a little distracted. It's called the bride-to-be blues. You think? Come on. I was a wreck before my wedding. What am I telling you for? You were there right up until you marched me to the back of those church doors. In your spotless dress. Listen. I just want you to know no matter what happens, I'm there for you. We could put Martha next to David. I don't think colleagues and family will mix. [MUSIC LILY FROST, "WHERE IS LOVE?"] This came for you. Hey, Steve. Murph and some of the guys are going down to the ballpark. You want to hit us some grounders? Nah. Want to grab a bite? I'm not hungry, man. Did you talk to Grace? She was a good friend to all of us. You too. And now, she's done her research, and she's getting married. And that's that. And I can't stand it here anymore. I'm going to go for ride. You coming or not. I got your back. Where are we? Bar number two. Oh. What? Did I screw up? What's wrong? You love this place. Nothing's wrong. Come on. That a girl. Excuse me. That last beer at bar number one went right through me. Hey, five tequila shots. Let's see what we can find. JEN: Any hit on the radar? No. Nothing. They're broken. Hey. Hey. You look like a married hockey player. Hey, they got mints in the ladies room. I'm going to get some more of them. -Did you get your recipe book? -Oh yeah. I got it back. Thanks. I have someone helping me on the cookbook now. Michelle. Remember her? Yeah. She's going to do the last draft. We needed a final edit so. Well, it doesn't sound like I'm going to see you after the wedding either. You know, um, you made a big difference in my life. I'm going to miss you. You made a difference in mine. I'm going to miss you too. Bye. Yeah. Bye. We need to move on. Now? OK. Grace. I'm sorry. Hi. Hi. Thanks for coming. You sounded really stressed on the phone. Are you OK? Yeah. I've been kind of overwhelmed. Grace, what's going on? I feel like I'm disappointing you. What? We're so close to the wedding, and I keep changing my mind about everything. I'm messing up our plans for everything. It's not fair to you, Cliff. Shh. We'll work this out, Grace. I don't know. I-- I don't think we should. Grace, look at me. We are going to work this out. Everything's going to be fine. How? I know how much you've been through since the fire, but I love you. And whatever you want I'm going to make happen for you. But-- A house in Saint James Village near Jen. Having kids sooner. A trip to the Bahamas or just a walk in the park, all these things you love. I want to share them with you. But will that make you happy? Yes. As long as you are. OK. OK. Hello, Grace. You know, the craziest thing is happening out there. There's all these people in formal attire waiting for something interesting to happen. What do you think the chances are of getting you married today? Ready? It's just nerves, right. Tell me it's just nerves. It's just nerves. Probably. I just need to get through this wedding and get back to normal. I really lost myself after the fire, Jen. We're best friends, right. Of course. I need to tell you this. I don't think that you lost yourself after the fire. I think you found yourself. You've been fun and friendly, creative, giving, passionate. You've been you again, Grace. But that's just your best friend's opinion. What do you think I should do? Whatever it is that's going to make you happy. That's all that matters to me. I know. So let's take it from the top. Are you ready? What's with him? Grace's wedding is today. And we weren't invited. No. Of course not. Why? Give me three hours, I'll explain it to you. Why don't you explain it to him? He doesn't listen to me. Frank. Look. I know that I give you a lot of grief, OK. But the truth of it is you are an excellent brother to him. You are the reason that Steve is still here. I don't know. MURPH: Believe it. Now, go talk to her brother. Because he only listens to you. Hey, Steve. Come on. Drop the gloves, huh. Put some clothes on. Why? We got a wedding to stop. You remember Jake the Fist? Biggest bully in grade school. Used to hunt me down every morning at recess and beat me up for no reason. Yeah. I remember you asking me to deal with him like it was some scene out of the godfather. And you remember how you deal with him? You didn't have to touch him. You just took him to the side and talked to him, and Jake the Fist never bothered me again. You did that, because you're my brother. And I've been trying to repay you for over a year now. I've tried everything, and nothing's worked. OK. So this is it. This is my last attempt to force you step up and try to start taking care of yourself again. At least, go talk to her. All right. Yeah. Let's go. Truck? No. I'm taking my bike. It's faster. No. No. No. There's no way I'm getting on that bucket of bolts again. Let's take the truck. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Where the heck do you think you two are going? Oh, hey, cap. Uh, no. We have to-- I got-- I go-- There's an emergency. It's a wedding emergency. We got to stop a wedding. And uh, uh, oh shove it, captain. We got to go. Well, at least, make it look like you're working. That was a real nice thing you did there, captain. Yeah. I have my moments. Yeah. [SIREN BLARING] Cliff. Grace. You look beautiful. I was looking for you. Me too. I mean I was looking for you too. I mean-- it's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding. So what do we do now? Well, I'm not running down the aisle yelling "stop the wedding!" Then, we create a diversion. A diversion. Put this gear on. What? We'll rush into the church fully equipped. You yell fire. And I'll evacuate the place. Are you out of your mind? We'll keep our masks down. No one will even recognize us. I'm too late. Look at them. I ruined everything. FRANK: Hey. Where are you going? I'm walking home, Frank. Leave me alone. Steve. You're a great brother, but you don't have to help me anymore. I'll be all right. You put your whole life on hold for me. You moved in with me. You need to move on. We both do. Hey, Steve. Hey, Michelle. Hi. Michelle, meet my brother Frank. Oh hi. Hey. Um. So you're a fireman too? Uh yeah. MICHELLE: I'm helping Grace with your company's cookbook so. Cool. Cool. I can barely boil water. Yeah. I'm not much of a cook either. So, uh, you like tattoos? I was actually going to get one. Need a lift? Something tells me you're not going my way. GRACE: You might be surprised. We didn't go through with it. Why? Cliff and I both realized we're on different paths now. Cliff's a great guy, just not mine anymore. I feel like a burger. Come on. Get in. Yeah. You might want to change first. Probably a good idea.
