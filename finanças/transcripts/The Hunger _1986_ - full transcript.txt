Just taking this stuff to Master Abd El-Ghaffar - She's a strong woman - Who do you mean? Can't fool your brother! Zebeida, I don't know why she's such a tomboy Though she's so feminine... What dimples she has! Have some shame! She's mind-boggling... Still haven't spoken to her? My tongue gets tied every time I try You're stupid then! If you're that crazy about her why don't you marry her? You know I can't afford it She's poor too... so she won't ask for much - Gaber! - Yes, master - What's keeping you, boy? - Coming! I'll see you later Say hello to Aunt Halima Come on... Sweet potatoes! - Give! - Sure, Master Mahrous Here What?! Be smart or else... Get a sack of rice, Sonkor Here - Where to, idiot?! - No where...

Curse you! Leave the fruits, you scoundrels! Don't take a thing, you thief! Get away! You drop them and you've the nerve to speak I'm a loser too... I have to fix the cart The owner's going to give me a hard time too! I've said what I have You go to him and I'll sort things out You do that but give me the transportation costs What a pest! Get out of here you! Alright... - Tell you what... - Yes? Pay us for our trouble What are you thinking about? The old days, when the Gebalys were the lords of the alley When our grandfathers lived here, did they ever expect that their grandchildren, would be so humiliated one day - That's life... Have faith in God - There's no God but Allah! If that's life, how should a person live? Patience until God relieves us And Fadl El Gebaly returns, like Aunt Halima claims? And like the poor dream? That's all we do - What can we do? - Oppose injustice - You're dreaming too - No, I'm not Look at you, you have the strength of an ox but to what use? What're you inciting him to do? I want him to save us and the people from this humiliation God said: " nd be not cast by your own hands to ruin" Take care, Goran and his men are keeping an eye on you Hide your strength or you'll be lost If I was as strong as you are, I wouldn't have hesitated Body of an ox and the heart of a bird Just be quiet! I'm the one who does everything, cooks, cleans... while you just sit there! Get lost, or else... Are you going to hit me or what?! You would! Stop it! That's enough! Everyone can hear your fighting! Tell your mother to hold her tongue You should have yours cut off! I asked her to help me cook, son I've been working all day and I'm tired I was preparing the pickles She didn't like it I told her I'll do it later and she yelled at me It was supposed to be at Goran's the day before yesterday It's all in vain We get nothing in return from them Now the Gebalys are serving bullies and thugs Oh, you big-mouthed... What is it, Ma?! The pain in my side has come back, son... It's terrible... Go in and rest, Zeinab will do the cooking - Take this, girl! - Yes - Take it easy - Oh Go on, take it easy... - Good evening - Good evening. Who is it? Zebeida Good evening to you Bless you I wanted to have a word with you - At your service - Thank you You're a good well-reputed man That's why I got the courage to come to you What is it? I want to tell you something... but I hope I can Go ahead, I'm at your command I'm afraid you'll think badly of me I would not - Master Mahrous - My cousin? What about him? He... He had promised me... Go on... I'm listening He said he'd marry me Mahrous?! Please speak to him before I'm scandalized If he breaks his promise, it'll be a disaster You're a sinner... Why would you say such a thing? This booza isn't fermented Really now, is it not fermented? Master Hinkish is the best booza-maker in Egypt So why isn't it doing anything in my "read"? Your "read"?! Read a book!! Just drink, Master Borhan If it's not good, let it ferment in your "read"! Welcome, Mr Gaber Goodness! What are you doing here? - Welcome, Gaber - Good evening, masters Have a seat What? You want to do what men do? That's honourable Bring us one here, Folla - Sure - Drink You know I don't drink, cousin Why are you here then? To pray? You came to the wrong place, then - Welcome - Thanks I have something important to discuss with you Sure... Go ahead Shouldn't we go outside? And leave all these people here?! This concerns you more than it does me... it cannot be postponed Folla, get these men something to drink till I get back - Sure thing - Thanks, Master Mahrous What is it then? Just not something to do with morals Everything has to do with morals Looks like you're going to preach - I'm going back in - Wait... It's about Zebeida Zebeida?! Daughter of Ismail, the sweet potatoe seller, God rest his soul I don't understand, what you mean? You have to marry her straight away No shame! How did she contact you? What's important is to stop this catastrophe from happening It's all in your head Didn't you promise her? So? I don't want her anymore You only wanted her then! Have mercy! She's an orphan! Her father was a good man I wouldn't trust a woman who gave herself away There's always place for valour no matter what you think Stop being so naive! Marry her, then do what you like I don't allow you to speak about this, understood?! If you're so big on valour, you marry her and leave me to my fun What's wrong? Has something upset you? What is there to make a person happy? Take it easy and pray to God, mention Fadl El Gebaly and he'll make things better You think that's possible, Aunt Halima? Certainly... but when he's pleased with us He never will while we are silent in the face of injustice He's pleased with you... You're of his flesh and like him You were an orphan at a young age You love the people and want what is best for them So he must be pleased with you - Good morning, Salama - Good morning, Om Farag - How are Fathiya and the kids? - Thank God for everything Why are you so late? I haven't been well for a while, Master I just got out of bed today Curse you! Get the stuff inside!! Watch it! This one does not count Tell me, Master Aboud If God grants one some money, and he wants to buy a cart how much would it cost? You want to be an owner just like that?! I'm just asking Then give me 410 piasters Why? I don't want the mule You mule! It costs 300 piasters alone You're not worth that much! Farag!! When?! Farag! How can you be insulted while I'm around? It's not considered an insult here Then curse this place to hell! If we weren't poor this wouldn't have happened It doesn't make a difference Gaber's right, if we accept insult we'll be humiliated! Farag! How dare you hit a woman? You crazy?! Get lost you lunatic before I kill you! You have no manners! Good God! I'll teach you! I ask your mercy dear Lord! Look out! Get out of the way! The rules that no one should interfere God bless you! God bless Farag El Gebaly! God bless him! Congratulations! God grant you joy all your days! Your friend is coming to suck up to him He's like that, always sucking up to manage - Fadl El Gebaly's still alive! - He came back to us today! His name is now Farag El Gebaly God bless him! God keep you, my son! What a glorious day! - Thank you - God bless him I'd never have thought you'd be the champ I'm overjoyed! I never thought so too Your late father had your strength But chivalry needs a strong heart too I still can't believe it You're just like Fadl God be with you in helping your people and yourself What a magnificent day! In the name of God, our only strength, the One Only - God has given us a glorious victory - He knew our bad state This takes away our burdens Everyone must be joyous Fadl El Gebaly's era has returned The poor will be provided for Those big guys have it coming Master Farag said so? He never thought of the position but to bring back justice Our conditions will surely improve Thanks be to God Makes victorious the weak and oppressed You have blessed us and made one of us the Champ God, strengthen him and help him to bring justice Amen... Keep him from straying Amen... Do not overburden him, merciful one Amen... The carpet for the prayer room has arrived! God keep you, Master Farag God reward you God grant you plenty of good Thank you, it's only my duty. Men... Honourable kinship... Your grandfather Gebaly built this prayer room - Honourable kinship - Thank you We've seen improvements in these few days not witnessed in years True Your satisfaction is our goal - Peace be to you - And to you Good bye, Master You agree to this? If it were up to me, there'd be no tributes But it's the Champ's orders Excuse me... Good bye How come he's relieving the poor of tributes. And doubling them for us! I'm concerned we'll return to his grandfather's era, then poverty will consume us all You're making a big deal out of it It's a huge responsibility, the alley needs a lot of work Take care of us first The Champ is the alley's protector and has to look to its interests And has to live like a beggar too, right? You'll never profit listening to Gaber Are you on my side or what? Stop looking higher than you can If I was, yesterday I wouldn't have refused- a marriage proposal from one of the richest merchants I insisted no one can take your father's place That's the least you could say Out of respect for your pa, not fear of you Gaber's mother married immediately after her husband's death, left her son with Halima the midwife while she travelled with her new husband Forget this! Who's the scoundrel who proposed? It was a legitimate proposal - Who is he? - Master Zenhom, brass dealer He's as old as I am, and he's married! Being fair to others and not to ourselves That's all we're good for You're right You just be quiet! Don't be upset Take these Here, Zeinab Didn't you say we shouldn't touch the needy's money?! Never mind... Take it Take it! They're not enough to make a difference! We're needy too! Curse you, you scum! You insulting me, you foul-mouthed woman! How dare you cross your borders! I swear I'll beat you up! I swear I'll mess you up! Not with me you scoundrel! I'd mess you and 100 like you up! You rude... shameless... You destitute crook! Stop it, girl! Don't you have any respect?! Cool it... Leave me! I'll show him what he's worth! Calm down... Think yourself a Champ? He was to rude to me How are you? Thank God Master Farag has relieved us from the tributes I... I didn't mean that... I know... but what can I do? God is great You're strange The people's conditions are better and everyone is overjoyed Why are you sulking? Nothing You've been unusually quiet since you got here Aunt Halima... I intend to marry Wonderful! You have made me happy! Keep yourself and your youth Do you have anyone in mind? - Good morning, Master - Good morning - If you don't mind, stand on the left - Here? - Yes - Alright - Good morning, Champ - Good morning, Asyouty Morgana, let your mistress come down Good morning, Farag Good morning, Gaber. How are you? - Darb El Ahmar, Master - Alright It's a lovely thing that our Champ and Master drives a cart, though he can have it easy, and no one could say a word Get Zanouba to have some kids for you We've tried... God is good God says He is with us when we seek Here please, Master God keep you for us, Master Thank you Good bye Let's go, Master... To the Citadel Looks like it's the first time you see mistress Malak Yes Decent girls are like that. El Simary's daughter, God rest his soul - The richest in the neighbourhood - God bless Wealth and beauty... She's refused all her suitors though Her little sister can't marry till she does Why doesn't she ride the carriage? She feels like riding the Champ's cart... So, you like her? What are you saying? It's what I do for a living I'm a matchmaker Good God... Look at this That's too bright for you - It's nice - It doesn't suit you Can't afford to be picky! - Hello - Hello! Where did you get these things from? Zeinab went to buy a veil from Master Aziz's to attend Gaber's wedding The man was so polite and refused to be paid, and gave her this as a gift - Truly decent! - Very How dare you accept something without paying, you scum?! What? You said to go to your brother's wedding Should we go in rags?! He wants to humiliate me! Can't he just let things be! Welcome... When we can afford it, we'll buy it Don't say that, I wouldn't take money from you I don't accept anything otherwise! You've got the wrong person! What is it? That guy is playing tough with us Nobody is able to make him budge No way to get to him His pride must be broken Who's going to do that? You? The One-eyed and his men Goran told me- that he's arranged with them to get rid of him, hoping that he can regain his position Good, Goran's one of us The One-eyed is asking for a lot of money Just get rid of this man Halwaga's Champ, the One-eyed and Goran Good God Who are they? Farag El Gebaly, who thinks he's a champ So that's him! Come on then, son of a tramp! - What will you do? - Stick with the winner Master Farag! God bless Farag El Gebaly! God bless him! - Who's the chief of the champs? - Master Farag El Gebaly! God bless Farag El Gebaly! I am very thankful No one will force you into anything while you are here I trust your valour I feel that you've wronged yourself You're more wronged than I am It's my mistake... Where has our champ been for the past couple of days? - He's in a bad mood - Why? He's upset that we're asking for pay from the Halwagy fight We can't communicate with him What should we say then? He wants to bring back his grandfather's era Wants to make the beggars into kings, and the merchants into beggars He'll make freaks out of us What shall we do? What to say? Comfort him... gently we'll see... Excuse me - You're excused - Good bye How long will this continue? - Till he goes - Really! There's no solution while this beast is alive It's up to you to win your men's hearts, not their animosity People have put their hopes in me, how can I let them down? Nobody said so Be moderate... Help me with the baking Have some mercy, you've worked me all day Women's cunning! If you're tired, why are you going after him? To get more tired! My upbringing prevents me from responding What! Your addict mother, or pickpocket grandfather? Still better than a dancer! - Shut up - Shut up!! Don't you dare!! I knew I'd find you here What is it? Nothing Ever since you were young, you'd only come here if you're upset, like our grandfather; when things got bad he'd come here alone What is it? You heard what scoundrel, the Halwagy's champ called my ma?! These insults are used to trigger fights It's not about a fight It's what I've been hearing for a while I heard it again recently from a close one So the neighbourhood must be gossiping People gossiped about the prophets You can't pick on every word said Uncertainty has confused me like a scorpion in my heart it stings every time I try to be rid of it I don't believe you're thinking like this! Shame on you Our father wouldn't have married her if she was immoral My mother is the most precious thing in my life I fear one day I'll hate her and myself - What are you saying? - Whatever I'll kill anyone who speaks so much as a word about her Calm down... You have many things to see to Let's get a move on, man - Good evening, Gaber - Good evening Eat... You haven't eaten all day Taste... You'll love it, she cooked it herself - Do you get dizzy? - What is it? Congratulations! God has sent you a most precious gift! She's pregnant! I'm the happiest person on earth! I will see your kids! I'll give out bread and beans, I vowed I would! I want to die! - What is it? - Nothing Don't be so concerned, the first months are always difficult You bring good fortune You've become more precious to me now Mother of my grandson! Listen... You have to rest completely... and lie on your back All you have to do is take care of the baby Don't worry about the house, I'll do everything What's going on, Sheikh Allam? Deibis owes us 3 months pay - He has mouths to feed! - None of our business He's a troublesome guy, and Master Abdoun pays his tributes in full Master Abdoun, if you can do this for me, let him back in his house, and if he hasn't paid in a week, I'll deal with him. Heard me, Deibis? God keep you, Master - As you say - Thank you Shall we change the contractor, Master for the fountain? - You deal with it - Sure, Master Master Farag - Good man - God bless him I had a dream last night The elite are wishing to see you, but waiting for you to take a step What do they want of a cart-driver? Mistress Malak Master Farag! Excuse me... but... But... What is it? You haven't asked or anything, so I thought you don't like me Goodness! How's that! I fear that speaking my secret has cheapened me Never, you're very dear to me I'm so embarrassed... I don't know what I've done... All is good... All is good... All is good, God willing... No... Don't misunderstand me... Please, don't misunderstand me... Don't misunderstand... A strong champ shaken by a matter like this? Didn't our grandfather fall in love with Nargis? That didn't change him - Good evening, Master - Good evening, Master - Good evening - What is it? I had wanted to speak to you about something... Sit down What is it? What do you think if I re-married? Why not? I intend to marry a third You can't hold women against a man But... there's a problem... Because, the new lady is, a daughter of an elite? I thought it was a secret! Love's odour spreads, Master What are people saying? Who cares about the people? Forget them! What forget them?! What matters is that the Master's men are overjoyed You've got the wrong idea Farag El Gebaly will not change Master, no offence, but what champ accepts this kind of life? Farag will never change, Doksh! He's lowly son of a lowly one! But she agrees Even so! Malak is crazy! She's refused his masters and accept this bum! Curse him & his lowly heritage! Nothing good comes from them! What shall I reply with? They want a celebration appropriate of the bride and the Champ I don't accept charity! Anything wrong with that? You're never wrong Concerning the living quarters, I have no objection for the bride to stay in her house, till I find something appropriate of her class Good decision! There's something important I hope you can be tolerant - What else? - Go ahead, Allam Paid labourers and workers have become arrogant They cannot be controlled Nobody owes anyone anything I don't mean that They employ many people Their shops give the neighbourhood a pretty picture What would it have been like without them? From what they pay, as you know, we built the Kuttab the prayer room carpet and the renovation of the fountain isn't that not enough? Excuse me, Master, why are we the only ones paying tributes? Because only you can pay Things are good with you People interpret this as they like They mock them. They do have a right to demand a treatment appropriate of their level Your general justice is unfair Unfair? Unfair to you and your men Why don't you take your right- and they take their right? No good will be achieved if each one doesn't begin with himself You're not sacrificing your lives for our pride?! The Champ & his men have to be from the elites - That's how they should be - Should No... My grandfather was the original champ, and he earned his living If your grandfather, that great man God rest his soul, had not lived in Banan palace, the alley wouldn't have flourished The champ was made to be an elite May God curse me if I have any ulterior motives - Let's drink to this - Let's drink Here, Master This is for the big night, you'll thank me I'll take it from you, Master Selim Welcome, Farag Welcome, son - Zeinab - Yes? - I want you - Sure... That's God's will... there's nothing we can do about it I'm going to marry another woman What? You? The good man? - God's will - No... Don't say that, it's the devil What? Throw me away after I gave up my life and youth for you No... - You'll have your rights - God's my only saviour You traitor... disloyal... This isn't necessary, girl He's not the first or last man to remarry You want me to celebrate? Let him get married and look to his interests You're satisfied with poverty? It'll go away when he marries?! The full will spillover Malak owns a lot If that's the cost, I prefer poverty Thanks, everybody Hope I repay you in weddings - Congratulations - Thank you May God give you happiness Thanks, Gaber Congratulations, Master God keep you, master of men What is this? - I'm leaving - Why? This is enough We agreed this was temporary, till this problem is dealt with Why are you in such a hurry? You've bore more than enough - Did I complain to you? - I feel it Whenever you see me, I feel you wondering why you did this to yourself I'm not the woman you've dreamed of You're a good woman To be honest, I can't forget your story with Mahrous... Stop I shouldn't be any later All that remains is a bitter memory I want you to know I'm not indecent What got me into this, was fear After my parents passed away, I was alone in a merciless jungle Mahrous was there for me I didn't know he had bad intentions I couldn't distinguish right from wrong You're the first person to care for me, make me feel I'm human I want you to know you're the dearest thing in my life You always will be God help me to return your favour Zebeida, don't go... I appreciate your sympathy, I don't how to repay you But life is not built on sympathy alone Good bye Zebeida! I... I love you... I love you Untie this, boy! Listen up, people! The government says the Nile has not kept its promise this year The flood is low and the produce may be poor The government warns against waste Everyone must ration their food and not waste his money till this crisis has passed The attendees inform the absent - What else? - Pray to God Good God - How many things can we handle? - What does this mean? Disasters will come after one another leaving nothing Like what? Food will decrease or disappear Then smart people will start storing up today Would you tie it further away? It's chewed the plants I've never seen a horse that likes flowers The best he ever used to get was clover, and that was his heyday He went nuts when he saw the flowers Since the announcement, everybody is buying They're fighting over the products - The store is crowded? - What? - Is it crowded? - Terribly Is this going to continue for a while? Let's drop the topic, I've had enough I can't wait to get home to rest You know I would've never thought, there was a bath like that anywhere It's better than the public bath! Spacious, hot water... beautiful! No one would believe this paradise existed in our petty alley! Your cooking smells great! Enjoy Really... if the whole world was revolved around you I wouldn't have had any cares You're wearing yourself out You're out from the early morning till evening For what? Nothing! It doesn't make sense You want me to stop working and be a thug? Why? Thank God, we have wealth Why don't you manage the flour store? Leave my job? What would people say? Who cares? What do we owe them? They'll say I'm living off your wealth. That's shameful! Isn't it shameful to let strangers steal your wife's wealth? I don't even understand the store's accounts My money is your money No, Malak... Farag El Gebaly will never change Nobody told you to The price of sugar has gone up too All because of people's frenzy to buy! Get the cart and carry this stuff, boy Thank God, we're at ease If he was like us, he'd have saved himself the trouble Don't mock. There may be no floods at all Then even the raw bread we suffer to get, won't be found It's a hopeless case anyway - Is the Master in, Shaker? - Yes. Come in Excuse me Hey, don't push! Keep away! - What are you saying? - That's what happened To be honest, I'm worried that things will gradually be as they were - What do you mean? - Don't get upset But your men are still living as bullies, they steal from the tributes they gather, the poor's share has decreased again But they're still not happy. I'm doing all I can, but this burden is heavier than mountains Get different men Their strength is in their numbers What's the solution? I'll deal with it... step by step Or else I'll lose my authority It's about compromise then! God's merciful to he who knows his limits What do you mean? Two can carry one basket Come work with me rather than preaching, carry some of the burden - Yes, but... - What buts? You've always been good at accounts Remember me cheating of you at the Kuttab? And I used to beat up the kids who bothered you But sometimes you used to turn on me Listen... From now on, Forget your smithcraft, to help me out and handle the store's accounts Shaker has me completely confused - Yes, but... - No buts or I swear... At your command, Champ That's good. You know something, I like this trading business very much It's very classy You meet the big businessmen all day A very respectful profession, rather than spending the day with donkeys whoaing them about You get on with your work Come have lunch with us today Zebeida and Aunt Halima would be happy I wish I could, but today is Zeinab's day She makes it a big deal if I don't go - She has every right to - I didn't say otherwise Between you and me, it's difficult to go I've made an important discovery Women come in two kinds A kind like cottage cheese, the other like... butter... cream, and I'm supposed to treat them equally. How? You shouldn't spend so much Don't waste anything these days Alright, Master You should say that to your Malak Aren't you ashamed of lavishing in all her luxury- while leaving us to this bitter life? Are you going to tell me this every time? At least treat us like you treat your men Or good only goes to them? Take these... What's this? You keep them You should know I intend to get married - What? - I'm getting married - What? - She's just joking - No I'm not - Then you're crazy! It's not against God's law This can never happen while I'm alive! Understood?! I swear, upon my father's soul, you will not leave the house again! What's this indecency?! There Welcome, Master Farag! No welcome! You listen here! You want to get married, do you?! I have decent intentions I have none! You'll leave this neighbourhood from now! See what he's done? This is the justice he's talking about? I said that Folla is mine! Take it easy, Master Mahmoud! Behave, all of you! Behave! I said, behave! It's not my fault, Master They're forcing her to entertain them Shut up! Curse you and your drinks If this immorality doesn't stop, I'll shut it down for you! I swear, it's not my fault Get lost! In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful "Hast thou observed him who belieth religion? That is he who... he who... That is he who repelleth the orphan and urgeth not the feeding of the needy" Continue and concentrate I'm sorry I don't understand what the words mean It means that who doesn't believe in God, is blind in sight and heart Everything you say is right Who treats an orphan with cruelty, and isn't gentle with the needy, God will not be merciful to him How when he has no mercy? As for: " Woe unto worshippers who are heedless of their prayers", you know what that means, of course "Who would be seen, yet refuse small kindnesses" Those who see the condition of worshippers, but do not help them by giving them something Why doesn't God just take these people away? A believer must oppose these people and their injustice - What if he cannot? - He must God will help him to triumph There is an end to all injustice I only believe this because you say it - What are you saying? - Nothing Please, Gaber, could you get me green melons? - Green melons? - I feel like eating it Craving green melons in these difficult times? Don't upset yourself then No, I'll look for it everywhere Or the boy might have a melon on his neck - 20 piasters - Why? - Two coffee and a hookah - That's double price Prices have gone up Do people have to steal to make a living? What should we do if they're complaining? Strange people Each of them has a big stomach and full of energy yet claiming to be poor, shamelessly I hope they're really impoverished to know what it's like - Change the water - Sure thing - Get some coal - Alright - Good evening - Good evening lmagine restaurants open only half-day because of the lack of food Enough of this! Everywhere I go, they're talking about food! Disgusting! Nothing is more important The 'mood'of course! It's the best You're right If that's lacking, people will go nuts It's what's making us bear this Take it easy! Quietly! One sack today, those are the orders! I only comply How's that going to be enough, Shaker? Don't be upset from rules Just take enough to suffice This is a crisis... What is it? How strange! As if it was a charity! His mother's in bed... Selim the herbseller, God bless him, gets her herbs & incenses, but it's useless Her health is deteriorating day after day Alright, I'll make him go see her He hasn't come for 3 weeks! It's not my fault he's upset with her That Malak must have used witchcraft, so he'd hate us to keep him for herself God willing, Master Ali God help me repay you, thank you - God bless you - Thank you Take care... Good bye Congratulations! I saw you negotiating with him A real merchant! I have to be the best at what I do! I bought goods with all we own, and I'll only sell a couple of sacks Light sales... I'll keep the rest when prices are sky-high Then we'll be on top of the market Isn't it risky buying with all our money? What risk? Prices are Skyrocketing There's no crop in the country God grant you profits all your days What about Master Sultan? I'll get his matter done, just for you Thank you, my darling You know something? It's not that I'm denying God's grace, but sometimes one questions, who's this all for? I wish I could have a child Don't worry, soon I'll carry your heir That would be the happiest day of my life Come on... Get a move on! 96... 97... 98... 98... - You said how many sacks? - 98 - I've counted 99! - I must be wrong Wake up then, this is people's money Everything must be correct There's no need for this No grudges at work I'll go to the people that are expecting the flour Thief! Thief! - What is it? - The scoundrels stole the chicken! There have never been so many robberies! A pair of rabbits and some ducks were stolen 2 days ago Hunger has made people desperate, they're not afraid of anyone What happened to you? Are these the ethics of our alley? We eat one another in a crisis? Rather than supporting one another and uniting in these difficult conditions! Shame! I am warning you! If any of you steals anything from now on, I'll cut his hand off! The attendees inform the absent! - I'm home if anything comes up - Alright, Master He's right. This famine has affected all, and we have to remain moral - Liars! - They're the ones stealing us You're right. I wish they would not corner the goods which they sell secretly at double prices Hurry, the kids are home alone Give me two ounces, please Hurry up There... What's this? - 20 more silver pieces - Why? - Price has gone up today - Half a sack Hurry up, you're holding up the rest Make them one ounce then You should have said so from the start - Hurry up, Shaker - The ounce - Four, Shaker - Wait! First pay, first service There are only 20 sacks left for sale - What are you saying? - Master's orders - Meaning? - I just carry out the orders Calm down and I'll explain everything Explain what? Come deal with the people, it's a mess out there What is going on?! You know that we live on bread I would have helped if I could we'll close up if we don't sell this way Where shall we get flour? You know everything is more expensive - What's the solution? - What can I say This crisis has hit us all It'll be over and the prices will go back down I haven't enough in the store to feed a bird! I swear by God, there's not enough bread in my home for two days He's lying! The stores are full! His price is another kind of tribute Lower your voice, Gaber I'm not working with him again! That's not wise... You have a child on the way Even if I have to beg, how can I go along with what he's doing? He's still your brother His sense might return to him He's a beast with a merciless heart! We don't need this too You can't fix the world! Here, eat this They say some are eating cats and dogs Is that unethical in religion? Necessity dictates Hunger is terrible. People will start chewing one another Should we leave the neighbourhood? Patience, my brothers! Till when? Till there's not enough air to breathe?! They're trading in our sustenance Have patience and pray to God to rid us of the drought Come on, let's pray for rain In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful: "Seek pardon of your lord. He was ever forgiving He will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain And will help you win wealth and sons And will assign unto you gardens and rivers" God is truth ful What are all these people? They're looking for a place where life is easier These are terrible days, be merciful God! Why does God let them hunger this way? Who knows His wisdom? Maybe they need to be chastened So that they would return to themselves Why did God leave us till we needed chastening? So he can test us Why didn't he just make everyone good? Will you doubt Him?! Is it true that Lady Malak will make food for the people? That's what they say; it's her sister's wedding Hope there's meat in it Meat! Chew on this! - He says there's meat - Good one! Where are you from? I'm from Sannorus, Fayoum What brought you this far?! - There's not a scrap for us to eat - Not a scrap! You think there's anything here! People are leaving here and you come! Get on out of here! We don't need this! Go on! Go on! - Peace be upon you - Peace be upon you Would you happen to have a job for me? Job?! Would have loved to help Please let me earn my living I already have two... All three of us are broke You're next, girls God is great Meat! Move it, boy! Meat! Give me a piece! A piece of meat! Get out of here! Get lost, you greedy! Give me a bit of meat! You jerk! Come here! Food, people! What are you doing? Choke on it! What is this? Get out! Get out of here! Curse you all! - I'll show you! - What will you do? - Free booza! - First time! We must be tough, this is an insult to you We won't be able to control them later You handle it - Get lost! - Go on! Out, you greedy! Stop it, men! Oh... My eye! Get something to stop the bleeding! Clean it with water and salt Rest It's alright, son See the injustice! The Tyranny! Our poor men They spend their lives in the dust then they eat their blood! Get back! Get lost! I have already warned you! And you still violate people's property... No! I never defend one at the expense of another! Understand?! I treat you well, so you overstep your limits! If this happens again, you'll regret it! You must do exactly as I say! No gatherings from now on After sunset prayer, every person, stays home! My men will deal with any violators! You have been warned! The source of all this immorality, is the booza den. Shut it down, Master Listen Sheikh Ramadan, who wants to drink booza, drink, and if you want to worship, you're free too Everyone is responsible for himself But I will not show mercy in the face of any mistakes Excuse me Good for you, Master. They deserved it I'm at home if anything comes up It's a filthy family of evil Then bullying is back again! He's a thug! Change the topic - Peace be upon you - Hello May I sit with you? Sure, you're the Champ's brother Be polite! He's been good to us Is this what you used to talk about? The justice you made us dream of! You're right, but what can I say? Looks like there's no hope for better Maybe Master Farag will return to the right path When hell freezes over... Excuse me You are correct There's nothing wrong with talking, but it's shameful to keep silent and not defend ourselves - Either killer or killed - Rather killed or killed He who doesn't defend his dignity should die! God has told us: "We have honoured the children of Adam" Will we disgrace God's will? There must be a solution to this misery That the Gebaly returns and saves us A dead man cannot return! Your grandfather is a blessed man We can fight for our rights You say really strange things! What is strange about it? Aren't we men? Don't be upset, we're just laughing out of misery You know how much we love you I don't know how Farag could do such a thing The devil, my daughter Why's man so weak in the face of the devil? The devil manipulates his weaknesses Is Farag weak? No matter how strong, a man's weak, when money and power control him Just mind your own business You've witnessed what his dogs are doing to people They're dreaming of Fadl El Gebaly's return Years have passed and they're still dreaming Without hope, people would die But El Gebaly is dead Who said so? He's alive! Alive in each one of us Inside of you... he's the good in a man... the hope that will be realised I'm sorry but my mother-in-law is very sick That's what forced me to come at such a late hour Mother... I know I've wronged you... I didn't mean to You know how much I love you Just like I know how much you love me You suffered and sacrificed a lot for me But you have to know, to me you're the most precious thing in the world Mother... You have to know, I fear for you so much Remember when I was young, what I used to do if a kid said anything about you? From now on, I'll make up for everything I'm buying land so I can build a house for you A big 3-storey house Just like you'd dreamed I'll buy you a carriage too I'll fill your closet with new clothes I'll keep nothing from you, but forgive me, Ma Be strong... God keep you It's everyone's destiny Only kids act like that! He's just acting. He probably killed her - What are you saying? - Trust me He probably heard something about her relationship with Zenhom Don't do this... You're a believer I feel lost and alone Don't leave me... Please stay near me I need you... From Fadl El Gebaly Here Good God! Get up, man! What? - Fadl - What? - Fadl - Fadl who? El Gebaly! El Gebaly is back! You're hallucinating from hunger... Look at this! Food? Where did you get it from? Fadl El Gebaly You crazy... - What is it? - You overslept Goodness! I had a strange dream! Hope it's good - I'll tell you a thing you won't believe - Don't tell then They say your grandfather's back Some have seen him in the neighbourhood You're going to believe this nonsense?! That's what I heard at the market today Let me Gebaly, indeed! Three nights in a row? He only appears to the poor - Us exclusively - Meaning? He's going about providing for us God is so generous We should keep this a secret - Good morning, Master Gaber - Good morning Come - Sorry, I'm running late - Just come No time for us, working with his brother again - I'm not in the mood - Till when? - Don't be like this - I'm very upset You're a believer... Every mother is dear but, there's a limit to grief Grief? I don't know if I was really grieving her or not You were in a terrible state One is in a strange state when confronted with death My love for my mother was strange I was blinded When the blindfold was removed, I found a rock in place of that love - Cold stone - I don't understand She was the cause of my misery, the burden I always carried - I don't believe this - It's the truth She was cunning, immoral and ill-reputed Shame on you. Remember the good things There's not one... Excuse me - Good evening, pretty - Where to? - Don't you miss my money? - The Master's inside - I'm the master of all - I said Master Farag Farag! What a black night! My Folla! I'm here... At your command and call Where are you? That's how women should be I finally found a woman who understands me Do you know who you remind me of? - Who? - The late one - Late? - My mother I could never match up! Yes, you do. I say you do, so you do! Wake up This is from Fadl El Gebaly Till when will this bad state continue? Why are the thieves and greedy lavishing in luxury? Why are the kind believers oppressed? - Why are people asleep? - You are Fadl El Gebaly? Congratulations! You have a boy! - Thank you - Go in, son Glad you're well, Zebeida God bless you Look... They all says he looks like you He has looks now? I think he looks like Zebeida Don't you wish! God keep you I'll go make something for you to drink What will you call him? She'll call him Fadl Glad you're alright, Om Fadl - Peace be upon you - Come, Sheikh Ramadan Hunger has driven people crazy Have you heard the nonsense they say about my grandfather? What do you think? Unbelievable This is sinful! Or what? Exactly What are you waiting for? Do your job! We are destined to die like those before us I caution you, my brothers, from going on believing myths This will lead you to sin If, as some claim, El Gebaly is back, why doesn't he get us out of this crisis? I warn you of the perils of chasing myths Every myth is an innovation Every innovation a heresy Every heresy to hell - He doesn't know anything - Exactly This is inappropriate, we want to hear - Alright - Let's go - Order! - What order?! Won't you come, Farag? What's going on? What's all this? Rather than staying up away from home, you'll find all you want here I don't feel like it tonight You stay away from home too much Why would I stay home? Everyone is talking and I'm turning a blind eye! Who would dare! The whole neighourhood knows They say that slut has driven you crazy Don't insult her! Of course I will insult such a lowly tramp! Shut up! She's more honourable than you and your family! Or anyone in this neighbourhood! So that's how it is! I love craziness Don't bother about what they say You're right I'm happy and at ease like this I want to stay this way Away from the world with you Forget everything There's nothing better You know... One morning I woke up, I found myself drunk Just like that I felt I was being reborn Wow! I felt I couldn't stand my life Not the one I live now or lived before I hated my job, I hated trade, profits, being the Champ I hated people and their hypocrisy I hated Zeinab and Malak I felt they were sucking away my nerves, when they have no right to I felt there was a fire... Coming out of me... So I thought, damn this world and its people, I'm going to look out for myself I want to tell you something Tell Tell, my darling You're the sweetest man in the world How can you hesitate with Gebaly on your side? Don't be upset... Curse poverty Curse gluttony, that's a man's enemy Who's there? Gaber What are you doing here at a time like this? What are you carrying? I was going to bless my son in the wilderness Bless him... At the blessed place for our grandfather went there... as if he'll return You believe this nonsense? I don't know... It's confusing That's a beautiful boy... Bless him - What did you call him? - Fadl Fadl! You really do believe it! Maybe God keep him... Good night I swear I'm innocent! You're a thief! - Come here, dog! - I swear I didn't take anything! More than half the store is stolen, you scoundrel! I'm loyal... I've served you all my life! You have the keys I give them to you every night! They stay in the drawer overnight! Nobody can touch them till I give them to you! Someone can take them then put them back Without me knowing! Why, am I a fool?! I can't accuse anyone but I'm innocent! - Prove it! - What shall I do? What are you doing here now? What are you doing here now?! Answer!! I came to save the lives of people dying of hunger You're Fadl El Gebaly then! I don't believe it You're the last person... Why? - I had to - Do what? Steal my stock?! Rob your brother? For what?! For some good-for-nothings... Where's the wisdom in that? Trade is one thing and humanity another Really! I was such a fool! My mother was right You've always been an envious fox Is this what I deserve, you Gebalys, for getting you out of your misery! You were stepped on! I made you respectable! We always have been up until you ruined our reputation What reputation? That of crooks and thieves?! Or tramps?! Enough nonsense! I'll show you, Master Gebaly Doksh! Borhan! Thief! Enough! - Speak up, boy! - Thief! Don't be beastly, stop! Deserves it! Pretending to be Fadl El Gebaly! Enough! Have some mercy! Move it! Move! Now I'll hang you up, Master Fadl, till your life slowly drains away Take him! Enough! Have mercy! Move! Isn't it enough you've humiliated him in front of everyone? He's your brother of your flesh and blood! Let him go Get away! You leave this neighourhood too! They're poor, Master God said: "And no burdened soul can bear another's burden" Shut up, sinner! Or I'll hang you! He sacrificed his life for you! Only you can save him! But how can we oppose the champ and his men? They're titans Poverty has weakened us, we've no energy We can attack at night, while they're asleep They won't be able to defend themselves We can't do that If we move, everyone will follow You have to move Gaber will die if we don't! He'll die... Om Fadl, I'm at your command We owe him Abu Domma There are strange noises... Curse the booza - Good evening - Good evening - Is Master Doksh in? - What at this hour? I brought these things for him... Let's go to the flour store Quickly, men! Strength, men! Hit the door! Come on, men! Gaber! There... Here's the flour Water! Some water! Take it easy - To the other store, men - Go on, what're you waiting for? Next stores, men! Don't worry yourself Curse those scoundrels! Things are crazy... Even the women are out with the men! Let's hope they don't attack our houses They'll steal everything! They won't even leave the bricks on the walls What are we waiting for? Let's escape! Where's your sister's husband? - Master Farag! - What's this? The stores are being robbed Goodness! Everything is upturned! - What a scandal! - Where shall I leave from? The roof The stores are being robbed! Help us, Master Farag! What's the meaning of all this?! What have you done, you sons of tramps? Look who's talking! If there's a man amongst you, let him stay where he is! - Don't be scared! - Stone him! - Face him! - Stone him! Hit him in the face! - Have no mercy on the merciless! - In the face! The beast has fallen! To Malak's house! Master Farag!! God bless Gaber El Gebaly! Believe me, this won't do! L've never carried a club I'm not strong and won't bear a thing No one else will be our champ! God bless him! Listen to me... This won't do... Find someone else we'll choose another but he must vow to be like Fadl El Gebaly! He'll change just like Farag, then we're back where we started! We trust no one, not even you Exactly... but you do trust yourselves? What are we worth? If we unite... if each one carries a club... with our children... Working together as one... Is that possible?! They united and realised their strength They were weak when they were separate Things are going to get worse than ever... We must send for El Etour's champ-quickly, to control them and stabilise matters Pay up then Hunger... Director: Ali Badrakhan
