What are you doing? Leave him alone! No! Don't do that, Tony! He's innocent. Leave him be! Leave me alone! Don't be stupid! Go! No, Tony! You've killed him! Let go of me! No! Murderers! No, you've killed him! Don't touch me! Is he alive? Hold on. Well? No. Quick, call them. Quickly! Well? We're done. Nobody must touch him. Tell everyone to come down. Hey! Oh! It's over. Come down! Yes, it's the investigator. Okay. -Are you calling an ambulance? -Yes. Let's cover it up. Come on, cover it up. Clear everyone out. Come on! There's been an incident. What's going on? Special Service, could you give us a hand? Get them away. No! Bring her here quickly. No! Move along, ladies and gentlemen. Come on! Get her in. Go on. There are ruins everywhere. You have access to three museums and I recommend the National Museum in particular. Seeing as… Seeing as you are interested in ancient history, as you say. -Would you not like a seat, madam? -Don't worry, madam. It's nothing at all. Without a doubt. Here are the tickets. They're for all your journeys. You can use the ferry. But, whatever you do, don't miss it. It leaves at midday on the dot. On Sunday night. There are no others. -What's gotten into you? -On Saturdays, I am insatiable. You're completely crazy. -I said I don't have time. -Don't worry. Look at the state of me. I love you. You're as stunning as always. One of those cakes that you can't resist. Do you want one? I'm going to feed you. It's good for your complexion. It's Aphrodite's recipe. A little circle here and another little circle here. Most importantly, we mustn't forget these two tips… We can't neglect them. A little bit of sugar. Sugar here too. Otherwise, it's not happy. Oh and the beauty spot! -It'll get jealous. -You're crazy. From Susucre Bakery. Do you like my beauty spot? -Is it real? -Try. The big, bad wolf! You'd like to hurt me, huh? Don't look at me. Right, I promise. I won't look at you. I swear. I won't look at you. I'm hiding. Look, I'm hiding. I've disappeared. I'm merging into the darkness. Is it good luck if the beauty spot is on the right-hand side? No, on the left. Oh well. In the mirror it's on the left side. Look at the amount of soap you have! You have nothing in your bathroom! Next time, I'll bring all my toiletries. -Are we seeing each other tonight? -Yes, I'll pick you up. At the galley door. I'll be there at six o'clock. -Don't keep me waiting. -No. Don't worry. Ah! Give me that. There! So you don't forget your girlfriend. Forget you? Me? -If anyone asks, I'll be there tonight. -Okay. She always gives me dirty looks. The poor woman is alone, you must understand. What are you going to do? I'm going to walk with my eyes closed and think of you. Can you not be careful, no? I'm really sorry. It was an accident. I'll have to go. See you tonight. Look! And some toothpaste and a toothbrush. -There you go. -Thanks. -And the toothbrush. -Do you have a small bag? -Waiter, a double cognac. -Okay, take a seat there. A beer and a double cognac. Here you go. No. -What? -No. Oh, come on! All right. Rematch, come on. All right. A rematch. Oh! You stood on my foot. Me? Just on the left there where I have a corn. No kidding. I thought it was on the right. He's got some nerve. Go, you… Special Service. What? Special Service! Would you kindly follow us? -Why do I have to follow you? -Pay for your cognac. Put your money on the table and don't forget it was a double. -What am I being accused of? -Come on! But what do you want? I've done nothing. Come on. Take in the fresh air, it'll do you good. There is too much smoke in these old cafés. -But it's completely absurd. -Go ahead. Don't make a fuss. -Let go of me! -Move or it will end badly. Get in. -What's going on? -Boss! Well, what? Quickly. It's better to go down Republic Boulevard. Go. Let's not waste time. Go! -Get in! -Come on, quickly. Move your arm. Tell me what all this is about. You don't have the right to stop me without a reason. -I'm going to file a complaint. -Go on. No one is stopping you. You'll see. Would you like a cigarette? No, thanks. What is it? Do you have a date? No, why? You looked at the galley and then your watch. I do it out of habit. Final stop! -Where are you taking me? -Don't worry. Everything is in order. One, two, three, four. There, all present! Oh, there we go! You can wait here. Take a seat. As you wish. You're not obliged to. Get undressed. What? How should I say it? Take everything off! You don't have the right to ask that! I want to speak to your boss. Come on. Take off your shirt, your jacket, your trousers. Your underpants too. Now, put this on. Hurry up. I don't have time for this. Very good. Don't worry. You'll get everything back when you leave. You're not allowed to touch the window. By the way, if you ever feel unwell, your heart, for example, we've had those types of incidents, you just push this button. Good luck! -If you need the toilet, say so now. -No. Are you ready? If you'd like to follow me. Wait here. Excuse me, sir. Sir, I am very happy to see you. -I'd like to talk about my arrival. -Do you want to close the door? Yes. Take a seat. So, would you like to share your version of events? But what events? Your accomplice confessed. But I would like to compare his version with yours. But which accomplice? What do you want to talk about? The one who stood on your foot in the café. Ah, I see. So? Well, what would you say if I told you that that man is part of a subversive organization? You are the only one he came into contact with in the sports café. But I have nothing to do with it. I don't understand this story at all. Could you repeat what you said to him? To the guy who stood on my foot? Yes. I think I said: "Hey, you stood on my foot!" And he said: "Me?" "Yes, I felt it in the middle of my left foot, where I have a corn." And what did he respond? Nothing serious. A joke of some sort. "I could have sworn I stepped on your right foot." Good. It's almost exactly the same conversation… But… One question. Why did you let him leave without responding to him? Well, I don't like to argue. It's not my way of doing things. I'm a peaceful citizen. That is where we disagree. Being a peaceful citizen, that doesn't mean anything. Why did you go into that sports café? Is it your usual spot? No, but you know, I like to try new places that have a good crowd, but maybe you don't understand that. This isn't about me. You looked at your watch twice. The second time was just before your accomplice came out of the bathroom. But why do you insist that he is my accomplice? I told you that I don't have one! Could you take off your left shoe? What? Yes. Your sock too. You do indeed have a corn. Show me your other foot. -And you don't have one on the right side. -No, as you can see. And this? What is this? Two circles. I can see that it's two circles. Oh, you know. It's a habit. I do it without thinking. I could have drawn two triangles or even two squares or anything really. Two identical circles. A small point in the middle of each circle, and another here, a little bit higher. How do I know that it doesn't show the location of a weapon drop-off? Can you enlighten me as to why you're laughing? A weapon drop-off? No. I told you. I'm a peaceful citizen. A peaceful citizen? That means nothing! That doesn't prove that you are innocent. For the Special Service, there are those in favor of the regime and those who are against it. "He who is not with me is against me." Do you know who said that? -Hitler? -No! Jesus Christ. But I have never done anything subversive. I've always lived peacefully. -But I'm a… -Yes, I know! A peaceful citizen. You are innocent if you enthusiastically act in favor of the regime and the progress of our country. My question is: what have you done for the regime? Even a small thing. Tell me even the smallest thing. Can you give me an example, sir? Don't tell me that you have never met anyone who has criticized the regime or even slandered it? Well, did you report it as you should have? I'm sure you did. But how many times? How many people have you reported? I'm sure you'll want some time to count. Well, I'll wait. Try to remember their names and their addresses. I have never reported anyone. I am sorry. That's the truth. Very well. Seeing as you do not have any proof of your innocence, you will be transferred to the capital tomorrow morning. Central will look after you. Besides, your accomplice is already on his way. We will confront you at Central. Sir! Sir! I no longer have anything to do with the incident at the café. The Latinturier case. Do you want him back? No, not now. -Should I start to interrogate him? -No, make him wait. -Sir. -Hello, sir. Hello, sir. Here you go, sir. Here are the clothes. They're the sports café suspect's. The collection is rather poor. Shit! I bought the newspaper! If you want to please your wife, you'd better be telling the truth. So. Could you check… Here is your card. List the addresses in alphabetical order. Understood? Are you going to answer my questions, yes or no? Yes! Why don't you have a suitcase? Have you found it? We filed it about six months ago. Here is my report on the toilet paper case, sir. I'm sorry. This A always jumps out. Yes, that happens a lot with these models. Do you have a small screwdriver? I can maybe help you. I'm sorry about this morning, sir. He jumped out of the window before I could do anything. It's a real shame. A shame for the Special Service. Yes, sir. That's what I meant. Such events paint a bad picture for national revival. You're too tense and hasty. Our country is experiencing an unprecedented expansion. People need advice and to be guided to our ideals. Imagine that there is no longer any difference between a suspect and an investigator. What do you think? Do you think it's possible? It's difficult, sir. Today, I couldn't even speak to him. Let's file this pathetic toilet paper case! Like this, it won't enhance our prestige. What would you say if, for a change, I asked you to work in a pleasant, nice atmosphere without handcuffs or interrogations? Take a seat. It's an exciting experience. A completely new method. We should be proud to be the first ones to implement it. At your service, sir. This is a good opportunity to catch up. Unfortunately, it will cost you your Sunday. Oh, shit! Since everyone is here, we can start. But how long will this trip take? I need to be at work on Monday morning. Let's go! It's a tight squeeze, but it'll be better to chat. This guy can't stay to the right. *The highway code should make them turn around. Good God, what is wrong with everyone today! Don't do that. Shall I crush you? You bastards! I hope you won't be a jerk. Me? You're not going to try to shoot. It would be a shame to spoil a beautiful day. I haven't done anything wrong, so why should I try and escape? All I want is for you to let me go. I'm innocent. They all say that. You know that you have a champion next to you. Look at him. See how he is humble and never talks about it. He has won every shooting contest for the past four years. It's good to take a breath every once in a while. Should we drive by the seaside, seeing as we have the time? -No need to be reckless! -Oh, fuck it. I'm going anyway. You should always have fun at work! Oh, damn it! This car is a clunker. No one is asking you to do anything special. Look! It's beautiful, right? It gives him the shivers. I have had stomach problems for four years. With interrogations that last hours, especially at night, we smoke too much and drink lots of coffee. And, in the morning, when he comes home exhausted, he still has to interrogate his wife! Why the hell can't we pass? Shit! Bravo! I was sure we'd get through. They do that to piss people off! Have you seen a construction site? Not me. I could use a drink. -No way. -What a mentality! Where the hell are they sending us? What's wrong with you? Why are you stopping here? I still have the right to take a piss, no? Don't you think you're exaggerating? Couldn't he go any further? Could I take a piss as well? Of course. Go and relieve yourself! Oh shit, I'm jamming the zip. The champion has his eye on you. Don't forget. Do you think it's starting to work? I don't know. It will be a rude awakening at Central. He'll confess during the confrontation. The confrontation! If I were you, I wouldn't count on it. -Why? -The other guy is dead. Really? The one who stood on his foot. He made a wrong move and a slightly nervous agent shot him not far from the café. Didn't the old man tell you? Nobody told me anything. Thanks, boss. Let's go. This car consumes as much as a tank. We should think about filling it up. Thanks for the flower. You are very kind. We could maybe all have dinner. I would really like to invite you out tonight. As soon as everything is settled, of course. Do you think Central will release you straight away? Of course. As soon as they put me face to face with the other guy, they'll see that I am innocent. Maybe they'll even apologize to me. It isn't impossible. It's not a road. We'll never get off it! Shut up! I'm the driver! Are you sure that we're on the right road? Well? Oh my God! Goddamned fucking junk! If I see the guy who gave us this crap again, I'll break that bastard's balls! Well, that's perfect. Oh, we can be happy! A good broken head gasket. Can we continue? Not a chance. So what should we do? We'll do what we can. Well! Motherfucker! If we miss the ferry, it'll be your fault. I didn't choose this car. What do you think? You're here not saying anything. If anyone should be annoyed, it's me. And if we look for a telephone box? Great idea. Hey! Where are you going? Fucking hell! Why do you have a huge suitcase? Are you going on holiday? -Why are you laughing? -Because of my wife. I promised I would buy her lingerie in the capital. And why do you need such a big one? You haven't seen her size. Do you have a corn on your foot too? Why didn't he tell me? About what? That the guy had died. Didn't you put your foot in it? Didn't you let a good witness jump out of the window? You screwed up two interrogations in one day. It's hard for the old guy to take. Do you want to do something? Oh no. It's to send a money order to my mother. -For her birthday. -That's good. You coming? We can all go in. There's room. Hello? -Hello? -Yes. Can you put the old guy on? It's Sunday. -Yeah, like I didn't already know. -Stay on the line. It was bound to happen with your shortcut. -Fuck you! -What did you say? -Oh, sir. -Yes. It's the head of the sports café case. Something has happened. Has he escaped? No, the suspect is still here with us in the booth. So why are we talking? The car has broken down, sir. Get it fixed immediately and call me back. But it's Sunday! Yeah, you already said. I'm fed up. I'm going for a drink. We have to find a garage. -No, leave it. -Thanks, you are helpful. Three orangeades. Cold with condensation on the glasses. We'll have to tow the car. My ass! Can you hear me? Yes or no? -Hey! Be careful! -Don't argue! We should be able to find a solution. We could ask for a car at the Special Service's regional office. Central are in charge. It's impossible. If you could drink it whilst it's cold… Come here! We'll give him a hand. Hey! He's going to take us to a garage! What a job! If this is what us agents are reduced to… When I think that I could be in bed with my wife making her lose a bit of weight. It's a good day for the champion's wife. She loves it when he's on an assignment. He's a fantastic agent. He knows everything, except what his wife does when he's not there. Do you like the building? Oh! What do you think? We see progress in the concrete. When we construct, we do it for everyone. Those in bad accommodation and workers. Oh! I've thought of something. I don't think it's worth us all going to the garage. One of us could stay and wait with our friend, huh? What do you choose, head or tails? Heads. Oh, it's always me. All right. I volunteer. Hi! How is it going? Not bad. We're pretending to argue. It's a funny job. That's a great idea! I don't know. Today, you have to be careful and, tomorrow, they'll break his bones. That's psychology. What's on the agenda now? A walk, I think. Either way, I'm leaving. I think I'll hire a prostitute. I know what you're thinking. Trying to find every opportunity to escape. And why would I escape? I haven't done anything. Exactly. You are not yet guilty. You are just a suspect. I have to say the Special Service agents are correct. Were you expecting something else? No. But sometimes we hear about bad treatment in very tough interrogations. Who says that? I don't know. Foreigners. I see lots at the agency. Let's go. Yes. The bathroom, please? -At the back of the yard. -Thanks. You understand I have to take precautions. You're my responsibility. Stand there. -And whistle. I want to hear you. -I can't whistle. You can sing if you prefer. The whale got married The whale, the whale The whale got married The whale, the whale The whale got married The whale on a summer's day The whale, the whale All in white, dressed herself The whale got married The whale, the whale The whale got married to a golden dolphin The whale got married The whale, the whale Get out of here. Here we go. I just had an amazing idea! How about a tour of the village? But only if you want. No one will force you to walk. Oh, I haven't said no. You don't look particularly pleased. Are you tired? No, but this is getting more and more complicated. It's really interesting. No, I told you. I am working tomorrow morning. Yes, but… Well, as you wish. We're getting the ferry this evening. We can make the most of Sunday. Let's go! -Can we leave the suitcases here? -Yes, of course. -No, listen. I can pay my share. -No, no way. -Next time, I'll pay. -All right. I am delighted with my idea. The weather is nice, it's Sunday. People look happy. I completely forget I'm on duty. -How much? -Two fifty. No three. Thanks. Here. This must interest you in your profession. Thank you. That's kind. -Do you know this place? -No. It was a very nice fishing port, but it's starting to change with tourism and development. The pretty areas are disappearing one after another. It's a little scary sometimes. How about a shave? -Huh, that would be good. -Good idea. Good morning, gentlemen. Please come in. Come in. I only know one maxim: when men are well shaved, society is progressing. The honor is all yours. You should take off your jacket, sir. No, thanks. With this heat! It's not that warm. It's the maze game! I bought one for my son. I could never do it right. However, I'm quite artistic with my hands. Ah, a little music to get us in a good mood. Your turn, sir. You'll take off your jacket now, right? I said no. Everyone is hot, by the looks of it! Look, if that's not sweat, what is it? Your mate took off his jacket. It's up to you, but what's the point in suffering? Maybe he has a gun under his jacket. A gun! Maybe he's from the Special Service. I am his prisoner. I'm sorry I did your beard. Get this foam off me. Not bad. Yeah. Are we going? And this is the joyful encounter my horoscope mentioned. It seems they are full of jokes. That's a new trick with the horoscope. No, but it's true. I just read it at the barber shop. Oh, really? We knew you came from the barber shop. It stinks for miles! What sign are you? Taurus. And you? Virgo. Were you going to the beach? No, we're just walking. -You're not from here? -No. And what are you doing? We're in real estate, my friend and I, and we're visiting. Oh! You're so lucky. That must be interesting. Do you travel lots? A little. We never travel. We take the coach once a week. Just to go to the beach. Do you go swimming often? No, we don't have much time. We work a lot. It's so hot today. It's unbearable. If I don't jump in right now, I'm going to pass out! Oh my God! I'm all sweaty. You too? Yes. It's windy today. I hope there won't be any jellyfish. We'll go next to them. I like the black bikini. I love it. It's nice. They are very well made. It's beautiful, two asses going into the sea. Those two would have a lot to say. No way I'm swimming. I hope you understand. What interests me most in a woman is the breasts. Do you have a girlfriend? She may be worried you're not there. It's rare to meet girls like that by themselves. Yes, it's very rare. They're cute. Next to us, they could be our daughters. Do you not have children? Unfortunately not. Are you unable to? My wife prefers to wait until I'm in a better situation. Are you not well-paid? You earn more than me. Well, let's just say we're about the same. Hey! Come for a swim! The water is really warm. They think we're friends. Should we act more friendly? If you want. -Don't you want to come? -We don't have trunks. You can rent some if you want. They do them for men too. A message, sir. It's from your friend. The one with the mustache. -He left with the suitcases. -Thanks. Shit. -What's wrong? A problem? -You bet! The car is broken. The manager has to go to town. Oh, what a bummer. Damn it! I'm sick of it. It's definitely our lucky day. I think you're getting really tired. Shit! And you start to repeat yourself. What? Why do you say that? Because you pretend to be surprised. But there's nothing unexpected about it. What? What are you trying to say? The shortcut, the breakdown, the phone call, walking around… All of that was organized beforehand. And even this walk that you suggested with such spontaneity in the bathroom. Everything was planned. But why would we go to all the trouble? So that I would try and escape and you would have evidence against me. What would you say to a nice ice cream with a Taurus and a Virgo? Oh, yes! What flavor would you like? Vanilla, pistachio or chocolate? -Chocolate. -Me too. Here you go. It's late. Are you coming? My friend and I need to go home. Do you have time to walk us home? I don't know. What's the plan now? Nothing in particular. Do you have to find your colleague? -Yes, but later. -So let's go. I'd love to. I'm here every day until six. -You'll call me? -If I don't have an accident before then. Don't say that. -Goodbye -Goodbye! Call me! The manager's expecting us at eight. We're late. How do you know he's expecting us? Come on. Why did you tear up her number? They were nice girls. Oh, I didn't want her to fall into your hands and for amiable officers to accompany them to the capital. -What could she be afraid of? -You'd know that better than I would. Let's take this one. Your gift was well chosen, as if you'd known me for years. You see, I work for something. I believe in an ideal. I often have the impression of trying to find my way. I know that there is only one and, sometimes, I'm desperate to find it. If I understand well, your job is to find the truth. Precisely. And, to find the truth, you are constantly obliged to lie. That must be very hard for you. Don't think that I enjoy lying. I'm glad that you've understood everything now. What? That everything was planned. The coastal road, the diversion, the breakdown, unloading the truck. And all that so that I'd try to escape. But it's so much work. What do you want to come of it? You think that I'm part of a network? And that it's going to reveal itself? It could be that. No. And has it revealed itself? I believed so when you approached the two girls. And me…. I thought they were in the Special services. You see, everything was planned, apart from the two girls. That was a little adventure we shared. We're late. Here. It's not me that's nervous now, it's you. You've got nerves of steel. I really admired the way you approached the girls. You did just what you wanted. Where is the manager? I never make it with girls, not even with my wife. Why not try to have a child with her? It's not that simple. -Why? -I'd never know if it were mine. Come on! Let me do it. Fine. Works for me. So, you bring him back alive this time? Do you want something to eat? -Do we have time? -Bah. Well, we've missed the ferry anyway. What? We weren't on time. Sit down! Take a seat! We were looking for you in the square. Don't worry. You'll get to Central. Nothing left for you to do but get the boat. The hardest part is over. The car is fixed. Don't bother. He knows. He's worked it out. And you also planned for me to work it out? You're cunning, and perhaps more dangerous than people give you credit for. No, it went very well. So what's he complaining about? Our new methods? You'd prefer an interrogation? Come on, why are you so aggressive with me? Listen to me, I'm a garbage man. It's necessary at the present time. You can't imagine everything we know about people. It'd disgust you. We know everything: their illnesses, their bad habits, how they shag. If they've been cheated on. And yes, that's the job. Sometimes I wonder what would happen without us. Because cracks are starting to show everywhere because of you! Wait! Don't light it! Isn't it funny? It's hardly good taste. Oh, good taste! You make me laugh. Good taste! That'll be the death of you. You shout if we beat a dog. You feel sorry for those being tortured and the millions dying of hunger. It's men of taste who throw away tons of food. God, I've still got to buy underwear for my wife. I'll be off. If it all works out, we'll soon be working for you. Ah! Before I forget! You have a room at the Grand Hôtel National. I'll come for you later. I don't understand. I'll come find you in the morning. Ciao! Come on, let's go. So, we missed the ferry. Yes. -The Sunday evening ferry. -Yes. There is no ferry on a Sunday evening. I'd know. Wait here, I need to let my wife know. -Can I make a call? -By all means. She's taken it off the hook again. I'm sure. I really am a king of fools. Do you want to call your girlfriend? No, it's fine. It's no ruse, you know. Our relationship is difficult but, really, I think you're a good person. What can I do? All that I can do for you is to offer you a good last day. Even if they get you to confess tomorrow at Central. Look me in the eyes. Do you think I'm lying to you right now? Could I still use the phone? Go for it! -Hello? -I was taken in the sports café. We know. Right. I'll be at the Grand Hôtel National, room 21. Will you come rescue me? You know very well they're just waiting for that. But do you think I could get away at Central? Your contact at the sports café was killed. They've got no evidence against you. Do I need to kill myself? That's up to you. Good luck, friend! That wasn't a girl you called. Let's go! Are you okay? Can you walk? Leave me. It's fine! Come on, back to the hotel. So that'll allow your colleague to go for dinner. Idiot! You've known for a long time? You're good. Stay two steps behind me. I'm tired and injured. I can't have you taking advantage. Sit down on the bed. Why didn't you save yourself? Your friends won't give you a second chance. If I wanted to escape, your colleague wouldn't be the one to stop me. You're talking nonsense. Just think about it. A motorcycle runs you down. One of your agents is on the scene. And what did he do? If he hadn't known about the accident, he would have intervened. Or at least note down the license to find it later. Sit down! I kept an eye on your colleague. He didn't even look at the bike. Ah! I follow you. You're saying it was us who planned the accident. Them! Not you. Why would you agree to being run down by a motorcycle? Anyway, being as careful as you are, you would've thought to bring another pair of trousers. They hide a lot from you, those friends of yours. The motorcycle, the ferry… What next, I wonder? Hello? Can you bring us up two cold beers please? No, no beer. Make that one beer and one orangeade. No, no. Not orangeade. Actually, forget the orangeade. Do I have permission to hang up my jacket? Yes, yes. Not very serious. You asked for it. You forced me to violence. Your beer is here. Go to the bed. Quickly, hurry up. On the bed. None for me. Oh, are you injured? Would you like me to tend to you? No. You can get me a needle and thread. -Very well, sir. -Thank you. Why did she bring two beers? Shit! They misunderstood. One beer, two beers. That's not confusing, even over the phone. Sorry. I ordered two beers. And then an orangeade. Then no orangeade. They thought we wanted two beers. They couldn't know that a Special Service agent wouldn't drink on the job. You don't want to drink with me? No one is looking. Worried I'll tell? -No, no. -Then what's wrong? I won't say anything, even under torture. -No, thank you. -Fine then. I'll drink both. Cheers! Go ahead, drink. Get drunk. Beer won't get you out of here. You're starting to improvise now. Look, the key's in the door. Another chance missed. -I'm here to make the beds. -Pass that here, thanks. -You're sure you don't want me to do it? -No. What are you looking at? You have a very pretty beauty spot. Yes, and do you know what it means? -No. What does it mean? -When it's on the right-- Enough, on you go. If you'll allow me, I need to take a piss. Sure, go ahead. Give me your belt. Why? Scared I'll kill myself? Here, you'd better change your shirt. Thank you. No! Go ahead. So, suicide? That'd be the worst thing for you, I bet? I'm sure of it. Am I right? Maybe someone else has already done it, no? For example, the man who stepped on my foot in the café? You've got a real problem. You let an important witness disappear. And they're watching you, hiding things from you. Yeah. If not, why would you have put on this show? It doesn't add up. You'd do better to come with me now. Together we'd have a chance to get out. But, if I don't make it to Central alive, you'll be screwed. You'll be toast! This whole operation can't have been organized just for me. You understand that. It's to control you. And you're charged with watching me, perhaps? Who knows? You'd make a very good detective. Me? What for? Ah yes, to help you sweep up the trash? People like the manager, we still need them at the moment. If there were more useful people, we could completely change this country. It's curious. You're a very strange type. You want everything to change. But you want everything to stay in order. Excuse me, but I have to take a piss as well. You want me to sing? No. I'll leave the door open. Turn away if it bothers you. Sit there. So I can see you. I don't want you to try anything foolish in the state you're in. Sometimes I put myself in your place. You know perfectly well what could happen tomorrow. And you feel sorry for me? Open the door! Open it, you hear? Open it! Open up. Don't be an idiot! That won't help you! Open the door! You can't escape. The hotel is surrounded. If I shoot you in the legs, you fall. It'll be over! Stop! You'll screw us both. Come back! Come back! Before people wake up. Nobody's seen you yet. I won't say a thing! You won't save yourself. Come back. I'll help you get out, I swear! If anything happens to you, I'm screwed too. Put down your gun, there. Get back. Go back into the room. Go! Go on, go! Pick up your jacket. Quick! Put it here. How many agents are outside the hotel? We've got to look like we're going to Central. It's our only chance. We'll get a ferry. It'll be two against one. It's the manager. Don't be fool here. Trust me. Give me. What's all this? We're taking you to the ferry. And my colleague? This wasn't planned. He's already at Central. There was a counter order. -Is it just this suit case? -Yes. Let's go. Your fly. Ah, thanks! Quite a serious escort. -Good day, sirs. -Good day. Hello. Wait for me here. Just a transfer. Nothing more we can do now. There's at least ten of them. Why in God's name did you change the plan? Something's happening. Here. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Bon voyage. See you next time! -Thanks for the help. -It's nothing. One of these days. Believe me, I wasn't expecting that. I knew nothing about it, you know? You see another agent? Go up. Climb! The manager was meant to come alone. Hey! Watch out! This is fragile. It'll break! Really? Sit at the back, behind me. And let me handle it. Stay calm. Start moving. I'll tell you where to go. I knew it! You broke them! Look! You won! Happy? Who's going to pay for these now? So, are you coming? You're going to leave me now? Get in! What more do you want me to do? You can't get out without me. All right, shut up. I'm coming. You don't trust me? No. I think we're being followed. What'll we do? Take the first left. Go right. We've got to leave the car. I don't see them anymore. -You're stopping there? -Yes. Just there. Right, now just walk normally. I'll take one, please. You go sit over there and wait for me. Yes, I understand. On the right of the headless dancer. I'm on my way. Let's not stay here. Come on. What's going on? What can I get you? Two orangeades. -I think we're being watched. -Calm down. Listen, but seriously. Where I'm going now, I can't take you. What am I going to do? You have plenty of friends who could hide you for a while. We'll let you know. Outside of the Service, I've got no friends. Your wife? Can't she do anything for you? Forget that. I'm not married. Where are the toilets? Downstairs, on the left. All these germs, they're American. And why have they come here? Simple! Because there's no control! They're everywhere now, these germs. And they're American germs! Yeah. In America, they deal with the germs and don't care! But us, we never had germs like that! They're everywhere now! It's the Americans sending us all their dirty germs! What are you doing? Come on! Come on! We'll go through the window. They've found us. I don't know how. Oh! Excuse me, madam. Goodbye, madam! We need to split up. You go left. Go around. We'll meet up on the other side of the square. Right, let's go! Gather around, ladies and gentlemen. The outer circle was constructed in 1934. It has 28 columns in this iconic style. Exact replicas of their ancient counterparts. And carved from the same stone. The entrance is this way. We hope you enjoy your visit. Let's go ladies and gentlemen, quickly, please. For the ancients, death was nothing scary. Nothing shocking. It was only the accomplishment of an inevitable destiny. Man is thrown from birth into an obscure labyrinth, on a journey which he little understands. He believes he has free will. At the same time, everything seems to be destined. Is this the sculpture of the headless dancer? I can ask, if you'd like. Most men accept this destiny and live in the dark. They allow themselves to be led towards a somber coast from which they will not return. However, some tried to overcome their destiny. Shit. I didn't know that he was there, I swear. I swear! You're not going to shoot. There are too many precious objects here. You could have broken something. Gently! Go, smoke a cigarette. We'll call you. Mission completed. He had his revolver. Ah yes, it's his? Here. But… But sir! Get up! Sit down. Would you like to remove your left shoe? I need to get it back, you understand? I have to take precautions. One day, we'll doubtless no longer have need for that. You mustn't be angry at us for putting you to this test. But, sir! You've done a good job overall. But the whore wasn't necessary. Come. We can only combat disorder if we ourselves have felt the type of vertigo that makes you wobble for a moment. You did exactly what we expected of you. Now you can better understand the nature of our work. Let him go! Madam, come this way. Let me go! What do you want with me? You have to consider human sentiment. Even the possibility of a flaw in a man like you. We saw it coming. It has been a very interesting experience for all of us. Will we ever attain such beauty? This harmony? I'm protesting against this illegal arrest! It's against the rules! The world has become obscure and troubled. I'm protesting! We're the only ones with clear ideas. A precise task. The states are fugitives. Only the police are stable. It's not politics we do. We organize the world. We work for peace. We're above borders, above ideologies. We won't hold back progress. One day, there will be no more secrets. Our Special Service will become a public service. For everyone. People will agree willingly to interrogation. Voluntarily. Everyone will help. No dangerous thoughts will be hidden. Our society will be transparent and logical. Needless to say, our service is only a small part in this immense international effort. -Oh, shit! -What's wrong? I forgot the bras for my wife!
