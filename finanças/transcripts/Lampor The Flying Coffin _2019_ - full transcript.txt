Take care of your brother, Netta. Yes, mom. Listen to me. No matter what, don't let it see you. And don't look at it. You're right. This is the dumilah charm. It will bring you fortune and wealth. Let it open! Let Jamal's child receive this charm. Please be quiet. Stop crying. Mom is looking for dad right now. Please be quiet for a while. Remember, Jamal. You can't have any more kids. Yes. Asti! Asti! -Call Jamal out! -But... You and your uncle, that heretic shaman, have to be responsible if anything happens! Mom? Mom? Mom? Jamal! Jamal! Are you finished yet? Ratna is still outside, she won't leave. Goodness. Go handle your wife. Goodness. What are you doing here? I can't stand to see you like this! Worshipping the Devil! Jamal, it's lampor. Mom! -Netta! -It's not her. -It's Netta! -It's not her! -Get inside! -No! -Get inside! -No! Jamal, we have to get inside! Get inside! Jamal, bring her in! He's being fussy, mom. He won't stop crying. Mom! Mom! Netta! What is it? You fool! Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't... Ridwan? Ridwan? Ridwan. Ridwan. Mom... Mom, Ridwan... Why did you leave your brother? I'm sorry, mom. It wasn't your fault. It was your dad's fault. Lampor took him because of your dad. Netta. We have to leave. As far as we can. I don't want you to be lampor's victim. -Alright? -Yes, mom. "Lampor, The Flying Casket" -I'm leaving, Netta. -Take care, sir. Netta, you have to be strong. -Your mother is in a better place. -Thank you, sis. Edwin, I heard you made a bad investment. You're thinking of selling your house, and you used your house as collateral. Is that right? I'd like to help you, but you know I'm just a common worker. It's alright. I can still manage on my own. Come on. Edwin, just let me know if you need anything, okay? Yes. Thank you. Sekar, Adam, bye-bye. Here's your tea, honey. Did you tell Anwar about our condition? Well... Anwar asked me. I couldn't lie. Are you still mad about my mom's last wish? I still can't believe... ...you've been keeping a secret that your father's still alive. Because Mom and I considered him gone. -Since... -Since your mother got mad... ...because your father remarried? I know that. You've explained that to me many times. I'm your husband, Netta. What's wrong with telling me the truth from the beginning? Yes, it was my fault, honey. It was entirely my fault. Honey. So, what should we do? We'll visit your father. We tell him about your mother's wishes. We? The kids will come with us. I'm sure they'll be happy to see their living grandfather in Java. Oh, my God! You surprised me! Where have you been, Endro? You're late! I overslept after sunset. -I'm sorry. -Damn you, sleepyhead. Here! Carry on. It's not done yet. I'm going back. Beware of lampor! Hey! Shit. I'm alone here! Don't be seen! Don't look! So, who will pick us up? My cousin Yoyok. He came to our house once. He's coming straight from Semarang. Have you seen Yoyok? Netta, have you seen Yoyok? No, I haven't. Wait. Where's Sekar? She's... Adam, where's Sekar? I thought she was with you. What's wrong with you? Sekar? Sekar! Sekar. Sekar. Hey, where are you taking her? Hey! Hey! Hey! -This is my daughter! -Wait! Goodness! Yoyok! Edwin, you don't remember me? Sorry, I've been waiting at the ticket booth. And then I saw Sekar all by herself. So, I kept her company because I felt sorry for her. Dad, look at that! The lion dance. They're coming this way! Move away! Move away! Yes, I will pay you. Relax, I won't run away. I know, sir. I got swindled as well. Just be patient. I'll call you back after I return home. Yes, sir. I will. Yes. Thank you. Honey? Can't you just contact Anwar? What for? You know he's my stingiest cousin. Well, he did offer to help. It's useless. It's not a solution. It'll only give us more trouble. You know, Netta, Mr. Jamal has become richer. He's the most successful tobacco merchant in town. A lot of people borrow money from him. Just see for yourselves how Asti dresses up. Just like those rich ladies in big cities. They gained those wealth unrighteously. Well, there's been a lot of talks... ...that your father was charmed by Asti. Mr. Atmo, her uncle, was a powerful shaman, right? What's a charm, mom? Stop listening, just draw. Charming someone is not a good thing. Only people with no confidence did that. Dad, look! The cloud looks like a dragon. Gosh. The villagers usually call that... ...a bad omen. What? Why do you have to believe in superstitions? Are those torches? Isn't there any electricity here? Of course there is. Those torches are path markers for lampor. What's lampor? The flying casket. People in this village believe... ...that the casket is carried by the grim reaper. You can hear them when they come. You'll be tagged and taken away. Every time they come, someone will go missing. Yok, why do you have to tell them that? They might believe it. I don't believe it, dad. There's no such thing as a flying casket. What, it has wings? What's wrong, mom? It's nothing. Can I use the iPad now? Just a minute. Why is there a traffic jam? What's wrong with your truck? I need to stretch my legs. Maybe the battery. Check it out. I'll help you out. You guys wait here, ok? Okay, mom. Honey? Mom once told me, if we ever need money, we can find my dad. So, you also told your mother about our condition? I didn't have to tell her, she already knew. Why do you think she insisted on being treated at home... ...instead of the hospital? Net... You haven't seen your father for 25 years. Now you want to ask for money, what would he think? You don't have to be that cynical toward me. You're the one being cynical. You said your father gained wealth unrighteously. Yoyok. Who are you with? You've been away for a while. I'm with Netta. Netta? How dare she return here? Her father just died. -Mr. Jamal? -Yes. Is grandpa a bad person, mom? Is that why you never visited him all this time? Who told you that Grandpa is a bad person, Adam? It's lampor, mom! Adam, don't speak nonsense! See for yourself! That's a flying casket! Adam, look at me. Where did you hear about lampor? Yoyok told him. Netta. Mr. Jamal... He passed away this morning from a heart attack. Huh? Passed away? Isn't that Netta, his daughter who left when she was a kid? Why does she have to return? Maybe she caused her father's death. How dare she come back here? She must be the one that made lampor came. Netta is the one that made your husband, Endro, died. How dare she return? You caused this! My husband died, taken by lampor! It's because of you! -Calm down. -What? -What? -Enough. You don't know how it feels to lose a husband! Please, that's enough. Watch it! I'm sorry, Netta. I'm Nining, Mrs. Sri's daughter. She used to help around the house. Do you remember my mother? -Nining. -Edwin. Please don't think about it. Let bygones be bygones. What a coincidence that you come home at this time. None of us expected it. I still made breakfast for your father this morning. But after eating his breakfast, your father died. Come on in. When they were about to wrap his body, suddenly your father was still breathing. So they thought that your father returned to life. That's why Asti asked Mr. Atmo to come. To take off the charm planted in his body. Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return. Just a minute. Asti, Netta is here. Asti. -I'm... -Netta. I know. You look just like your mother. Now what? I took them all out. Honey. Honey. Your daughter, Netta. She's here. Come here. Come on. Come here. Say something to your father. Come on, greet him. Dad. Mom has gone ahead of you. She has a message for you. She said she has forgiven your mistakes. Dad, this is Edwin, my husband. And they're our children. Adam and Sekar. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, why do you leave me? Mitha, that's enough. You're the only one who ever loved me, dad! Dad! Dad! Did your mother ever tell you about this girl? Dad! Dear Allah, forgive him, bestow mercy upon him, pardon him, accord him a noble provision... and make his grave spacious, with Your mercy, The Most Merciful. Yoyok. Edwin doesn't know about that lampor incident. But you told him about that. Now what? Honey, where's Sekar? Eh? Sekar? Careful. Sekar, what are you doing here? Whose grave is this, dad? This is your mom's brother's grave. He died when he was little. He was ill, wasn't he? Yes. Sekar. How did you get here? Grandpa told me. Bimo is Mr. Jamal's assistant. He also lives in Mr. Jamal's house. Listen, he's a gaok, you know? Gaok? A broker. Bimo. How is it? It's taken care of. He sells tobaccos to the Chinese merchants in town. If the farmers are late with their debt payment, he'll be Mr. Jamal's debt collector. You too, Adam. Net, let me put the extra mattresses here. You're so lucky. You just returned and immediately received an inheritance. I'm just kidding, Net. Everybody's talking about it tho. After all, you're the only rightful descendant. What do you mean? How about Mitha? Mitha was adopted. Mr. Jamal and Asti couldn't have children. Perhaps because they're lonely, they adopted Mitha as a daughter. But your father really loved Mitha, you know. He would give anything she asked. No wonder she seemed so sad. Mitha is sad because she can no longer get easy money. Asti is different, unlike Mr. Jamal. Really? Asti and Mitha don't get along. But Mitha is a hard-headed girl. Incorrigible. Didn't you see that city guy she brought? His outfit was outlandish. Like a punk. Mr. Afung. -My condolences. -Thank you. -My condolences. -Thank you. About the tobacco... Please, no need to talk about that. I'm here just to attend Mr. Jamal's funeral, alright? Please come in. -Yes. -Please. There's gossip among the villagers that he's Asti's secret lover. Ning. What is it? Was my father happy? -With Asti? -Yes. Well... I don't know the measure of someone's happiness. But it's true that lately your father often lost in his thought. Even more, after lampor reappeared in this village. So, lampor really do exist? Of course. So, if you hear the alarm after sundown, that means you shouldn't go outside. It's dangerous. Why's lampor terrorizing this village? There must be a reason. The villagers said lampor comes... ...whenever there's something not right in this village. What do you mean? Well, there's something wrong. I don't know what exactly. What's that got to do with our arrival here? I don't know much about lampor. The villagers said... ...lampor came because Mr. Atmo was able to control it. That's why lampor hadn't appeared for a long time. So, it returned because Mr. Atmo couldn't control it anymore? I don't know, that's just the villagers' talk. This is ridiculous, it doesn't make sense. You saw it yourself. Charms were extracted from Mr. Jamal's body. Stop asking, I'm going home. To Semarang? To my aunt's place. Take care, Yok. I meant what I said. Keep an eye on your kids. I will, thanks. Lately, this village becomes pitch-dark during the night, Net. We can't see the moon or the stars. It's eerie. Just like back then. You remember, don't you? But lampor comes when there's a sinner here, right? Lampor acts on its own. It appears whenever it wants to. Besides, is there anyone without sin nowadays? Ma'am. -Help me with this. -Sure. Bring it to the front, careful. I need to go home, it's getting late. Alright? Netta. Your sibling is born. It's a boy. A boy, dad? Hooray, we have a brother! A baby brother! Are you okay? I'm okay. Are you sure? Hey, I'm here for you. Okay? Netta... Let's go back to Medan, alright? My father just passed away, honey. I understand your condition now. I'm sorry for your loss. But I don't understand the villagers here. They don't welcome us, Net. And about this lampor thing, they're so superstitious. It doesn't make sense. But what doesn't make sense in this place doesn't mean that it's not true. Honey, what about... ...asking for financial help for your business? I'll find the right time to ask Asti about it. Netta. Hey. Yes, Mitha? Dad told me a lot about you. He really wanted to see you. Be careful if you're staying in this house. Lots of venomous snakes here. Your stepmother, Asti, she's always afraid that her wealth will fall into someone else's hand. Beware of my mother. She never expected... ...that you would suddenly come like this. I know that my mom has many secrets that... It's hard. In our room. On our blanket. I can still smell his scent. On our pillow as well. I can still smell his hair oil. Be strong. I'm glad. You came home at the right time. The long lost daughter... ...has finally returned. No wonder... ...your father passed away peacefully. Asti. Please forgive our insolence. Mitha. Where are you going? Your sister just arrived. You should get to know each other. Save it, mom. Stop acting nice. You hate me, don't you? I hate you as well. I better leave this place! Problem solved. Mitha! Should I go after her? No need! She's troublesome since she was a kid. Netta. Stay here for a few days, will you? Your children must be tired. Alright. I need to rest. I'm tired. -Bimo. -Yes? Please explain to them. About lampor. Don't be seen. Don't look. That is the rule. What happens if we disobey? They will come for you, put you inside a casket, and take you to a place... ...that even you don't know. And then? You will return dead. Or missing. At best, you'll return sick. Or insane. Mitha. How was it? I got them. Some cash and certificates. Certificates? What for? You should've just took the money. -Stupid. -Stupid. -You're stupid. -We can sell them. Adam? Adam. Turn it off. What's wrong, dad? Do you believe in lampor? It's not about what we believe, but we have to respect the tradition here. Do you understand? -What a piece of junk. -Tony, listen! It's lampor! Lampor? -Where? -Listen carefully! Start your bike! -Hurry! -Alright! -Tony, hurry! -What's wrong with this bike? Hey, Mitha! Mitha, wait! You're leaving me? -Mitha! -Tony, get in here! -What's wrong with this bike? -Tony! Dad! Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Grandpa? Tony, get in here! It's lampor! It'll take you away if you're outside! Where? Tony! -There's nothing here. -Tony! Help! Dad? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Lampor! Honey? Honey. Hey. Where are the kids? Honey, calm down. The kids are playing in the field. It's okay. I'm here. Do you believe that lampor exists now? If lampor had been existing a long time ago, why were you asked to return here? What exactly is happening here? Is it because you showed up on the day your father passed away? So they think you bring disaster... ...and had to do with the return of lampor. Let's find the right time to talk to Asti... ...and we'll go home, okay? One, two, three, release it! The kite goes up! Fly higher! It's high enough. Higher! Keep going! Keep going! Sekar. Whoa, awesome! It flies so high! Grandpa? Grandpa? Look at that, Sekar! The kite flies so high! Sekar? Sekar? Sekar? Sekar? Sekar? Sekar! Sekar? -Adam! -Sekar? Sekar! Sekar! Sekar! Sir, choose the soggy ones and dry them outside, alright? Yes, Miss. Nining. Nining, do you know where Asti is? Asti? She went to the market with Bimo. Why are you looking for her? We need to talk to her. It's about... We need to hurry back to Medan. -The kids are... -Dad! Mom! -What's wrong, Adam? -Mitha! Mom, I forgot my kite. Let me take that. Hey, Adam! -Lampor! -Mitha? Lampor comes for the sinners! I know who the sinner is! She brought lampor here! Mitha! Mitha! Let me get Mr. Atmo. Why not a doctor? She's not sick, she's possesed. Wait. The string snapped! Adam? What are you doing there? I'm taking my kite. What's wrong with Sekar? She had a fever. Did you give her any medicine? Netta. -You heard what Mitha said. -Honey... Your arm. It's alright. She knows who the sinner is, Netta. Are you listening to me? What if she was talking about you? If it is me, then what? What sin? You didn't cause your father's death. We came here in a proper way. You had a message for your father. Why don't you ask Mitha... I want to hear it from you! Do you have more secrets that I need to know? You've been acting differently since we got here. Mom. Dad! They're taking Mitha away! Where are you taking her? Where are you taking her? Mitha has seen lampor. Tonight it will return to take her. She has to be exiled from here. So you're sacrificing Mitha, huh? If not, you all will become the victims! Come on, take her to the field. Wait! There must be another way to stop all this! Stop all this? Who do you think you are? Lampor is the grim reaper of Goddess Roro Kidul. Who dares against it? Even if you do, do you know the consequences? You fool! A plague will kill us all! Move! Yoyok, wanna come over? -No, it's getting late. -Come on. -Are you sure? -Yes. -Alright then, I'm going in. -Yeah. Help. We can't just let this happen. They're not making any sense. They want to sacrifice Mitha. I need to know who the sinner is. -Honey, that's enough. -What do you mean? Did you see those people? They can't accuse you like that, Netta! They intimidated you. Maybe this is all my fault, honey. You left this village when you were eight! Eight years old! What sin could an eight-year-old possibly have done? You're not sure yourself, are you? I need to see Mitha. Adam, please look after your mom and sister, okay? Yes, dad. Honey, wait. What are you doing? Why are you here? We have to hide! Let's go! We have to save Mitha. Mitha! Tell me who the sinner is. Tell me, who is it? It's not Netta, right? Huh? -Edwin! -Who is it? You should put this on your body. The smell might fool lampor. Who is it, Mitha? Who? Mom and Bimo! They spend a lot of times together. And Dad died suddenly. I suspect that Dad was killed by them. It's coming! Don't be seen, don't look! Don't be seen, don't look! Don't be seen, don't look! Don't look! -Don't be seen, don't look! -Don't be seen, don't look! Adam? Gosh. Adam? Adam? Net? Netta? -Netta. -Honey! I tried to call you... You're not the sinner, Netta. It's Asti and Bimo. They're having an affair. Mitha also said that they killed your father. Dad was killed? That's why Mitha was sacrificed. To cover their secret! Mom! Mom! Adam... Adam is gone. Honey, Sekar and I have tried to find him, but we couldn't. Honey! Honey! Mom. Mom. I'm scared, mom. Sekar, look at me. You must not be weak. I'm not weak, mom. Wipe your tears, come on. Sekar. Sekar, listen to me. You must always remember. We still have Dad, okay? Dad won't let anything bad happen to us. -Mom. -Okay? Okay? Yoyok, please help Edwin, will you? Adam is missing. Adam is missing? -Sir. -Hi. Excuse me, sir. -Yes, sir? -Have you seen this boy? No, I haven't, sir. -Thank you, sir. -Sure, you're welcome. -Excuse me, sir. -Yes, what is it? Have you seen this boy? No, I haven't. My son was playing here yesterday. I don't know. Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Edwin! Adam is missing, Yoyok! -He's not home! -Let's find him! Let's check the house. Do you have Adam's belonging? Yes, sir. Here. I found it lying around here. Maybe he played with it last night. Maybe it was making noises that brought lampor here. Is it true, Netta? Was your son taken by lampor? No! Adam couldn't have been taken by lampor! My son is innocent! Whoever breaks the rule will be taken by lampor! It was your fault! Mitha was talking about you, right? You bastard! What did you say? Your depravity invited lampor here! What proof do you have? Bimo! Bimo! Let him go! Edwin! If you want to know why lampor took your son, ask your wife! She knows exactly why your son became the victim! Net! Netta! -Don't! -Let go of me! That's enough. Calm down. Net! Netta! Honey! Honey! It should've been me who was taken by lampor. Not Adam. You're not the sinner. It's not about sin, honey! It's about what should've happened 25 years ago. It was me who was supposed to be taken by lampor, but Ridwan became the victim instead. Ridwan your brother? Huh? So, he died not because of illness? He was taken by lampor. So his grave is empty? You lied to me again, Netta! Why? I... I... Why? Because Mom didn't want me to keep feeling guilty. I kept feeling guilty. Ridwan became the victim because of my dad's heresy... But now Adam is missing! It's true what they say, you're the sinner. You sacrificed Ridwan, your brother! I was afraid. I was scared. Adam is missing because of you. Because of you! I'm sorry. Forgive me. Please forgive me. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. Lampor has no right to take Adam... ...just because of what you did. I'm gonna keep looking for Adam until I find him! But how? Whatever it takes! Whatever the risk! I will not let lampor take our children! As a mother, you shouldn't have let lampor take our children! Understand? I'm going to look for Adam, Yok. If necessary, to whatever grave that thing nest! I'm sure you know the myth about its lair. You do know, right? Surodipo Waterfall. -Gondo Mayit Cave. -Let's go. Take me there. Mom. You have to be strong. You have to show your love for your children. What did you say, dear? Those aren't my words, but Grandpa's. Grandpa? Sit here. Sekar. Where is Grandpa now? Grandpa was there, mom. Sekar, you see Grandpa often? Yes, mom. Keep going, Adam! Keep going! Sekar... Did Grandpa tell you that... That Adam is missing? Grandpa said, either Adam or Sekar... ...will be taken by lampor. Sekar. Look at me. I need to go for a while. You're not afraid of being home alone, are you? -Okay? -Yes, mom. Okay. Good girl. Wait here, okay? I know you're mad at me. Because lampor took Ridwan that night, not me. Now you're punishing me... ...by giving Adam to lampor. Then what, dad? Are you gonna take Sekar away from me too? Then what, dad? I shouldn't have returned here. Mom shouldn't have forgiven you. You never change! How come you never loved me? Your father loved you. He wrote these letters without knowing where to send them. He wrote to you every year. For decades, he kept hoping that you would come home... ...and forgive him. It's wrong if you think that it's your father's fault... ...for what's happening to Adam. It's because you want all this to be my fault. Although we all know... ...that lampor returned here because of what you two are doing. Asti, I know about your affair with Bimo. No need to deny it. I don't need to deny anything. Your father knew about my relationship with Bimo. He didn't care. He even gave us his blessing. As long as Bimo and I don't do things that would embarrass him. Then why did you kill my father? Who told you that? The waterfall is that way. Wait here. Eh? Hey! Mitha? She's a liar. You can't trust her. Perhaps she told the truth this time. With my father gone, you and Bimo can get married... ...and had complete control of my father's wealth. I would never do such a heinous thing, alright? I'm not a murderer. What if I tell you the opposite? That I was... That I was forced to marry your father... ...because he had a debt to pay to Mr. Atmo? Even so, I still tried my best to fill your mother's role. I still tried to love a man... ...who could never forget his family. Until his last moment. Here. The inheritance your father left. It's for you. Grandpa? Sekar? Mom? -What are you doing? -Look at this, mom. Grandpa showed me Adam's drawing. Grandpa? Yes, mom. Is this where you flew your kite? Grandpa said... ...that you have to see this. Adam! Adam! Adam! Excuse me, Asti. You need to see this. Asti. Can you please take care of Sekar while I'm gone? Where are you going? I need to find some proof. Sekar. Look after Grandma, okay? Yes, mom. Bimo. I'm worried... ...Mitha will found out about our relationship. She won't, Ning. Mitha only knows about my relationship with Asti. Alright? Then when? I have to take care of Asti. Just like what I did to Mr. Jamal. Prepare the poison. We'll wait for Mr. Atmo's order. He asked you to gain control of Jamal's wealth. Who's there? Son of a bitch! That little brat! No! Don't! Honey? Honey, are you here? Asti, my wife. You have been deceived. You have been betrayed by those you care for. Honey. Grandpa is gone. Grandpa said... ...that you have to take care of me from now on. Atmo! Where's my son? Huh? Where is he? It's too late. Your son will become lampor's victim tonight. Why not Bimo? He's the sinner! Adam! Help! Help me. Atmo! Atmo! Atmo! Where's my son? Atmo! Atmo! Where's my son? Edwin! Yoyok. We have to get back, Yok. Netta is innocent, Yok. -Come on. -Let's go. Leave my baby alone! I'll kill you! You shouldn't have come back here! Especially with your meddling kids! Don't run! You're dead! Die... Die, you bitch! Ouch! Ouch! Sit here! -Adam? -Mom? -Mom! -Adam. Bimo, don't! Let him go! This is what happens when a kid... ...mess with adults' things. It's alright, Mommy's here! Bimo, let us go! Nining! It hurts! Adam, calm down. I'll get us out of here. Please let him go. Let me be your sacrifice for lampor! Nining, turn on the lights. Ning! Ning! Mom! It hurts, mom. Get inside, Bimo! -Lampor is coming! -Let's go. Please just let Adam go, Ning! Nining! Nining! -Adam? -Mom. -Adam, listen to me. -It hurts, mom. I know it hurts, son. Die, you motherfuckers! Adam, lean on me. Take a deep breath. Calm down, Adam. -Yoyok! -Dad! Dad! Turn the lights off, Yok! -Dad! -Honey! Adam, Netta! Damn it! -Bimo, don't! -Let me go! Untie Adam first! The lights! Turn them off, Yok! Turn them off, Yok! Edwin. Honey. I love you so much. Take care of our children. No, Netta! -I'm sorry. -No! Netta! Let her go! Mom! Let my wife go! Let my wife go! Die, you bitch! Let her go! Netta! Let her go! Netta! Let my wife go! Mom! Netta! Netta! No! The lights out! We need to hide! Bimo, please don't! -Bimo! -Let me go! Let me go! Don't look! It's over. Are you okay? Netta, where's Sekar? Sekar... Grandpa said, either Adam or Sekar... ...will be taken by lampor. Sekar! Net! Netta! Netta! -No! Sekar is at home! -Be careful! Please take care of Adam! Netta! Sekar, wake up. -What is it, grandma? -Sekar, you have to hide now. -Hide? -Here. Get under the bed! Come on. -Grandma... -Close your eyes. -What's wrong, grandma? -Close your eyes! Don't open your eyes, alright? Close your eyes! Close your eyes! Stay here. Hey! -Hey! -No! -Come on out! -No! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Open them! Come on, scream! Scream now! No! No! Mom! Help me, mom! Help! Mom! Please help me, mom! Mom! Mom! Sekar? I'm coming! Sekar! Mom! I'm here! Are you okay? Sekar, look at me. Are you okay, dear? Get up. This way, let's hide here. Look at me. Sekar, I want you to wait here. Don't go anywhere. Dad and Adam will get you. Mom! Mom! Mom! Hey, I'm the one you're looking for! Take me instead! Don't take my children. And leave my family alone! Netta, my daughter. Have you told me all of your mother's message? Dad... "Suro diro jayaningrat," "lebur dening pangastuti." No matter how big the sin is, love will prevail. Sekar, forgive me. I love you so much. Okay? No matter how big the sin is, love will prevail. No matter how big the sin is, love will prevail. No matter how big the sin is, love will prevail. Netta! Netta! You shouldn't have returned here! There will be no witness left tonight! You're the source of all this trouble, just for some wealth! Wealth? That's what Nining and Bimo want. You want to know what I want? I want to give Netta back to lampor. Her willingness to sacrifice herself to be taken by lampor.... ...in her daughter's place... ...will make me an all-powerful shaman! Undefeatable one! I will rule over lampor! Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Don't be seen, don't look. Mom? Just hold on. We're almost there. Sekar! Mom! Sekar! Mom! Netta! Are you alright? -Yoyok. -Yoyok. Honey. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you. "Until now, lampor is still a myth..." "...and keeps terrorizing the people of Central Java." "The truth about lampor and its victims remains a mystery." "The victim's family..." "...chose to keep it a secret." Peace be upon you, Edwin. Are you going back to Medan tomorrow? Want me to pick you up at home? At 6 AM? I'm on it. Yes, sir. That's fine. Yes, I will. My husband came back along with a storm after taken by lampor. And then, he got sick and lost his mind. The whole village was in commotion. Some people said that my wife was taken by lampor. Lampor has been here before. Because I could only see yellow. It was normal at first. When I woke up, I realized that I was taken by lampor. I was told not to play outside after sundown. At first, I felt terrified. Then suddenly I was in a strange place and I don't know how I got there. It was big, black, with red glowing eyes. They were calling me. I could see them. I was there, but they couldn't see me. After further investigation, it was true that I was taken by lampor. I was sleeping in front of the TV. When I woke up, my wife was gone. My children and I tried to find her. Perhaps it was all God's plan. I can only accept. That is proof... ...that my wife... ...was taken by a spirit creature. Maybe lampor or a djinn.
