This programme contains some strong language and some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting Right. This is Play For Today. Slate one, take one, no less. Interview with some old fart sitting here. A play for today - just today. Helps pass the time. Something easy, something undemanding. Lasts just a bit longer than a bag of crisps and has the same sort of taste. Play For Today - a series of single dramas broadcast by BBC Television between 1970 and 1984, years of crisis when the consensus politics of Britain's post-war world began to unravel. When industrial relations, education and the health service faced fundamental challenges. When the country was struggling with the end of empire, and when the personal was increasingly political. Play For Today reflected and responded to all this and more in 300 dramas shown in primetime to audiences numbered in millions. What? I never watch plays on the telly anyway. Not ever? It's such a tiny little picture and tiny little people all boxed up together. I can never get involved in it. And half of them are so gloomy. Ooh, my ideal audience! Play For Today was contemporary, often controversial, and occasionally censored. But it was also immensely varied, colliding social realism with comedy, costume drama with fantasy, personal visions with state-of-the-nation overviews. It was mischievous, critical and challenging, and unafraid to tackle taboos. ON TV: Beautiful thing... HE SWITCHES TV OFF That is a straightforward incitement of perversion and immorality. The BBC seems to have lost all sense of responsibility and decorum. That was sick. Really sick. I was watching it, Richard. What? If you look at the whole body of Play For Today as a whole, the diversity, the integrity, the range, the freedom of expression, the freedom of ideas, the freedom of dramatic and cinematic and thematic exploration, etc, is exemplary, and must be an inspiration for anybody that's thinking about, you know, the nature of what film or drama, um, is or should be. 50 years after the series began, this film is a celebration of Play For Today. As recalled by those who made the series, it celebrates many of our best actors, writers and directors, and it celebrates how, through more than a decade of crisis, Play For Today made exciting, exceptional and enduring drama. Before and after the Second World War, BBC television relied on plays from the theatre for most of its drama. Then in the late 1950s, the new commercial ITV network started to commission original scripts about life in contemporary Britain. Under producer Sydney Newman, armchair theatre attracted large audiences and critical praise, and in 1963, Newman was headhunted by the BBC. Producer James MacTaggart and story editor Tony Garnett were charged by Sydney Newman with making a series of single dramas about life in the mid 1960s. And the brief was to do contemporary drama that rattled the cages of the establishment. What a brief. Ken was one of a handful of directors. In fact, I think we worked Ken harder than anybody else. And during that work period together, we got closer and realised that both politically and aesthetically, we had the same attitudes and the same agenda. We shared the same sense of what good drama was, and the aesthetics of it as well to do with absolutely reflecting the comedy and tragedy and drama of everyday life, but based on a kind of clear political idea. Here we go. Absolute quiet. Quiet! CHATTER Quiet! Quiet, you see? There's never quiet in that studio, for God's sake! By 1965, it was clear that the electronic studio was a limitation to revealing the contemporary fiction. We wanted to do stories from the streets. We weren't interested, in the end, in theatrical sets in a studio like this where you have three big electronic cameras poking into a piece of work that had rehearsed like a play and was performed like a play. The form didn't...didn't allow us to make drama that had the smack of contemporary life about it. # Oh, oh, little girl # Pretty little girl # You're such a good little girl # Why don't you let me # Make you a bad girl... # It was the time of the French New Wave. It was the time of hand-held cameras, 16mm film, which was lightweight. So, we were in our late 20s, cheeky, full of brass neck. Up The Junction was a series of short stories and descriptive little events, beautifully written by Nell Dunn. And it took place in South London in Battersea, where she'd lived for a time. And they were a group of working class girls, and their...their comedy and their serious situations they'd get in, and their boyfriends. And it was funny and racy and raucous and full of music. I knew I couldn't get that in the studio. In fact, Up The Junction had to be made partly in the studio with electronic cameras, although much of it was shot on the streets of South London. # I want to be loved by you # Lo-o-ved # Scoo-boo-bi-do. # RAUCOUS CHEERING AND CHATTER Oh, look at that, Sylvie, that old man in the gutter. We better turn him over in case he's our dad. OVERLAPPING CHATTER Hey, Sylvie, there's your husband. Where do you think you're going, all dressed up like the Queen of Sheba? What's that to you, you fifth-rate ponce? Always was one for the men, weren't you? Anything in trousers, you'll have him. You dirty sod, I hope your guts drop out! And because they did quite well, that was the first film. So, that point was then conceded - we could do films. We thought we were part of the public discourse, and we wanted people to use their critical faculties when they watched fiction that... ..that was similar to the way they viewed the news. The Wednesday Play ran for six years and featured a much wider range of drama than just the social realism of Ken Loach and Tony Garnett. Then, in 1970, the sports department claimed the midweek schedule, and The Wednesday Play moved to Thursdays under a different name. We were inheriting what they'd created with The Wednesday Play, so it was a very fortunate position to be in. That's to say there were high audience expectations. On the whole, people did keep coming back week after week after week, not knowing what they were going to get, and that was part of the point. There was a variety and a range that was as wide as you could make it. # Open up your window, let some air... # The first Play For Today was broadcast on BBC One on Thursday, October 15th, 1970. Between a dozen and 30 dramas would be shown each year under this title for the next 14 weeks. The brief was to produce 75 or 80-minute plays about contemporary Britain that was challenging, which was code for controversial. And you were very aware of the stars of Wednesday Play. You were aware of Tony Garnett and Ken Loach, the tradition of social realism. In fact, one of the virtues of Play For Today, I think, was that it was far more various than that. There were far more different kinds of play. More than 200 writers scripted plays for Today, or had their work adapted. The majority of the broadcasts were commissioned specially for television, although there were also versions of theatre plays, novels and short stories. The series was an opportunity for new writers, as well as a showcase for the most prominent playwrights of the time. I realised that it was still imagination and people's fantasies, people's wishes, people's pains, people's anguish that really was the stuff and substance for what we could write about, and television has that peculiar power when it is dealing with what people actually dread, think, want, are joyful about. # Can't you take a dare? # I double-dare you # To kiss me and then... # I always feel that it brought out... ..the sincerity in writers. I think that was true of Dennis Potter. When Dennis Potter wrote for the wide audience, he was thinking, as I was thinking, "My mother's going to watch this. "My dentist is going to watch this. "My cousin's going to watch this. "The world is going to watch this." It's pointless trying to show off how clever you are. What...? Where does that get you, with that audience? The more prestigious Plays For Today were often shot on film away from Television Centre, but the organisation and the economics of the BBC meant that most Plays For Today were recorded in studios with multiple electronic cameras. BBC Television Centre was built round these vast studios which serviced series, serials, plays and entertainment, and everything else. So, it was a very tight, tightly controlled amount of people and facilities. We were given total freedom on the one hand, and an extremely rigid requirement on the other. Studio production was far more cost-effective than filming, and budgets often dictated that studio plays had to be mounted with limited resources. I don't know that there was anybody given the choice who would say they would rather work in the studio. I can't quite think that that would be so. But there were a lot of people who thought - and I thought - that there were very great things you could do in a studio. # Sir Atwood, Sir Atwood Two by two # You at the start must turn and follow through # The drums shall play and the whistle shall blow # Sir Atwood, Sir Atwood said You must go! # "They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. "Adders' poison is onto their lips." David. Psalm 140. FLIES BUZZING Lord, who's led thy servants to this desert of the fallen world... ..look upon my family with thy kindly grace. May my faith be for them thy pillar of cloud by day. Thy pillar of fire by night. I look at some of the studio productions that I did, and I think the directors have done incredibly well to create worlds. I mean, in some cases, very small worlds. Someone's nicked the top. It's there. It's very dangerous, that is. If someone should light a match over here... Gotcha! What the hell?! What are you doing, you bloody fool?! Watch it. What's your name? My name? What's his name? What's your name? You ask me my name? I've only been here five years. Oddly, I don't feel cramped when I watch them. There's so much going on and they're so well designed and well photographed. For the studio pieces, you're looking for sustained... ..dialogue. But it was writers centred in a way that film-making isn't. The understanding that the writer was central was also a credo held by senior figures in the BBC's management. The creative impulse in most of British broadcasting comes from a producer or a director - or both - working with a commentator or a reporter who may themselves be writers, or, and very frequently, with a writer as such. Many people contribute - designers, cameramen, all sorts of people - but the main creative thrust is there. Next week's play is The After Dinner Joke, a comedy concerning a young woman's adventures in the world of big business charity, starring Paula Wilcox. That's Play For Today, next Tuesday evening at 9.25. On occasions, Play For Today's work with a writer demanded a radical alternative to both conventional studio production and film-making. I was desperate to do anything Caryl would agree to write, and I do think that I had read an article in the Financial Times about charity. So, I said to Caryl, "Well, what about this?" So, probably I think what happened is it just came in, and obviously it was wonderful. A wonderful satire. But equally, obviously, it was set all over the world, and completely undoable, you know, as a sort of naturalistic Play For Today. But I think we thought, "OK, let's think about blue screen," as it then was. Green screen nowadays. What I want to know from you, Mr Mayor, is where in your town are the people with the money so that I can get it off them. Won't find it easy. They're all conservatives. They don't play golf with me, you know. Where do they live? Up here on this hill by the park. Ooh. And down here? Between the high street and the canal is what we call "the old town". Ah, the slums. Uh, the redevelopment area. It was certainly... It was an era when it was much more fun to be breaking the rules and taking chances than just doing the same old. None of us were in the business of doing the same old. So, we just worked out how to do it, and it remains an oddity to this day. Many of the most distinctive Plays For Today came from BBC Pebble Mill in Birmingham, where David Rose ran English Regions Drama. London drama does tremendous work, but here was another outlet and inlet. Writers could come and talk to us, as well as us seeking them out. And, in fact, Huw Wheldon, who was our managing director at the time, said, "Boyo, there's one thing to do. "Find new writers and nurture them." He wasn't politically motivated in the way that Tony Garnett always admitted he was. He had a broader palette. But nevertheless, he wanted to challenge the audience. He wanted to come up with something new and different. The basic thing about David was he trusted the artist, and that, you know, it's rare, isn't it? And actually, the first Plays For Day that Birmingham did were comedies written by Peter Terson. And the second one, which was my favourite, Shakespeare Or Bust, the three miners were called Art, Abe and Ern, and Art turned out to be a fan of Shakespeare, and the three miners went for a week on a barge to Stratford-upon-Avon. And when they got to Stratford-upon-Avon... HE LAUGHS ..they queued up with great excitement for a production of Antony And Cleopatra, but they hadn't booked seats. They couldn't get in. You what? Not a seat? No, house full. But we've made a pilgrimage from Leeds. Yes, well, that gentleman has made his from Japan, but that still doesn't make a seat available. It was absolutely joyous. They go across to the barge, and, of course, the actors playing Antony and Cleopatra appear on the bridge. Oh, this is great. Have you come far? A pilgrimage. The birthplace of The Bard. You'd be better of going to the birthplace of Karl Marx. Well, you've come up in regal style. "The poop was beaten gold. "Purple the sails, and so perfumed "the winds were lovesick with them. "The oars were silver..." "The oars were silver, "and to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made the water "that they beat to follow after as amorous of their strokes." Oh-ho! That sounded good! Hey... Wait on a bit. You're not... You're not in it, are you? You're not actors? "Pastoral, historical, tragical, comical. "Historical tragical, comical, pastoral. "We are the only men." HE LAUGHS Hey, lads! They're actors! What's your names, then, kiddos? This is Janet. I'm Richard. Well, I'm Art, and this is Ern, Abe. We come from Leeds. Gentlemen, welcome to Stratford. So, there's a wonderful celebration, but it is about Shakespeare and the working class. But it embraced life. It opened to life in a way that perhaps some of the drama coming out of...of London in Play For Today limited life in some ways. Not the greatest ones, but did...did take views. Now, if the business of movies is pleasure... ..the business of literature and drama in the final analysis...is truth. It can provide pleasure, of course, and delight and insight, but its main concern is the exploration of truth. The truth of a news bulletin is the degree to which it accurately describes an event that has taken place. The truth of the play is not so different. It's the degree to which it accurately describes a world conceived inwardly. It's the degree to which that world, inwardly conceived, has been accurately embodied forth. The degree to which it is not meretricious. The degree to which it hangs together as a single object, cutting no corners, cheating no-one, including the author. When Play For Today began in 1970, after a period of relative industrial peace, British politics was again dominated by disputes between workers and employers. The politics of the workplace was central to a number of early dramas, often told from the series dominant left liberal perspective. A documentary style social realist study of a strike betrayed by union leaders, was among the most powerful. There hadn't been a strike here for 100 years, and the union enjoyed the protection of a closed shop where contributions were automatically deducted from the workers' pay packets and meetings were as rare as a sunny day on a wet weekend. Then it happened. INDISTINCT SHOUTING And the first place was our lads in the sheet works. They walked out at half past 11 over some minor discrepancy in the payslip, which was something that they'd been complaining about for weeks. But it just seemed to snowball, like suddenly it burst like a carbuncle that had been a festering. Confrontational class-based politics featured elsewhere in the early Plays For Today. INDISTINCT SHOUTING A reconstruction of events in Cornwall in 1913 pitched workers in the clay pits against a special police force brought in to help break a strike. INDISTINCT SHOUTING The key analysis that society is based on class conflict and that the ruling class exploits and the working class is exploited, and the struggle between the oppressor and the oppressed, the imperialists and the colonised... ..that holds. That was the politics that we got, we were welcomed and were drawn into, and pleased to be so. You probably remember in 1970, the tremendous clothing strike when 30,000 clothing workers in the area of Leeds and throughout Yorkshire, and to some extent in the North East, came out on an unofficial strike for a shilling an hour. The strike lasted for five weeks. It was something completely new. Or at least new in the clothing industry. The most ambitious and arguably the most radical of the workplace Plays For Today was based on a recent strike in Leeds, where the workers had come close to winning all their demands. WORKERS SING You know, we didn't want to substitute propaganda for quality, and we wanted to do drama. When we did drama, we did drama. But I think none of us ever did what we were accused of many times. You know, propagandist, or left-wing, you know, tub-thumping. We really didn't do that. Our characters lived, and, you know, and... ..our stories... were there to be scrutinised. You know, "Are these just being manipulated, "or do they have internal life?" And I really was, I know, inspired by the Eisenstein, Pontecorvo, you know, Pabst sense of film. And, uh... ..Eisenstein had been extremely important to me when I was first trying to get my feet on the ground in film-making, just cos there was no film school or course on film-making. CLAMOURING Well, I must say, I wish it was as easy to deal with all the employees as that. So, it seemed to me that if the film... ..if we were going to deliver a film, you've got to sort of... not explicate it, but you've got to illuminate what happened, you know? What do you think you're doing? I'm drawing up a statement for the press. They stampeded that vote, Joe. Harry Gridley in his mob. You know that, and you let him. I could sense the mood in the meeting, Maggie. We didn't stand a chance. Why didn't you get up and say something? Well, why didn't you? You know as well as I do, politics is the art of the attainable. And I was involved in inner politics that was absolutely clear that you have to go further. You have to organise, you know, that strength and turn it into a proper instrument, and so on. Invision comes tonight from Leeds, a city that provided the backdrop to the highly controversial Play For Today Leeds United, shown on BBC One last night. Today, Leeds has been talking about little else. The critics on the whole enjoyed the play. Even the right-wing national press was full of praise this morning. So I got away with Leeds United, and then I got just a couple of half-hour studio plays after that. And I reached a point by 1975 where I was... I'd been just out of work, you know, and there wasn't anything coming in. And I heard from other people that people had wanted me to do stuff, but they were warned off. By '76, I was one of several people - and Roy Battersby was another, and Tony, in a different way, was another - were being fingered by the unseen, sinister forces of people, from whatever intelligence unit it was, had to lean on the BBC and say, "Watch these people. They're trying to cause trouble." Routine political vetting by MI5 of applicants to the BBC started in the mid 1930s. As late as 1984, the BBC was being advised by the security services to refuse employment to those found to have been a member of the Communist Party, the Socialist Workers Party, or the Workers Revolutionary Party. I was told by somebody who worked in personnel that we, you know, we all had our personnel files and that, if you were suspicious, you were a troublemaker or wherever it was, you had... There was, in order not to put anything in writing, they had a Christmas tree in the top right-hand corner of your file. Apparently, I had five! LAUGHS So you sort of knew. And of course, it...it worked. I mean, I was blacklisted and I'm not making... I... I made my own choices about politics, and I'm not... The struggle, you know, the class society is the class society and, er... I'm sorry, because I know I would have...I would have continued directing and that would have been good, I think, you know. As it was, I had to kind of fight my way back. When Play For Today began, the Second World War had ended only 25 years before. The 1945 to '51 Labour government, committed to renewal and reform, had been out of power for less than two decades. Certainly the writers who I was working with and my friends and the world, the universe that I occupied was a universe that believed in the promise of the '45 government. That's what informed our work and our work in the theatre. So that extended into television. But, of course, the writers that I commissioned - writers like Trevor Griffiths, like Ian McEwan - were writers who were associated with policies of the left. But they're all too good writers to think that simply putting left polemic on television was either valuable or influential. Another great act, the administration of 1945 to '51. Now there, surely, if nowhere else. I make no mention of my own part, but look at the record some time objectively. If I may borrow a very overused word from you for a moment. Now, look, we said we must have full employment and we had it for the first time in history outside of wars. We said we must control the commanding heights of industry. So we took coal, the railways, transport, gas, electricity, iron and steel into public ownership. We said we must have a say in how the country was financed so we nationalised the Bank of England. And underpinning all this, we created a caring society where a person was entitled to a good education, to health service, national assistance and pensions as of right. The extended welfare state, created by the 1945 Labour government, was engaged with and examined in plays for today about the health service, about education, and about the effects of urban planning. Important, too, was a sense of the post-war betrayal of the true tenets of socialism. A real social revolution would have committed itself to be irreversible destruction of capitalism and the social order formed and maintained by it. A real social revolution would have affected the major redistribution of wealth in favour of the labouring masses. A real social revolution would have smashed the bourgeois state apparatus and begun the creation of a people's state. Writers set out to understand the defeat of the potential of 1945 and to delve back into the war years to examine the myths that had accrued over three decades. Licking Hitler was an attempt to, as it were, diagnose what had happened in the Second World War, and why we were telling ourselves lies about what had happened in the Second World War. And when I met Sefton Delmer, who had run black propaganda during the Second World War, I had been absolutely astonished to find that there was a filthy, lying, deliberately misleading operation in which the enemy was to be tricked by lies being told by the British. The game is we're a radio station broadcasting to Germany. Yes. My job is to script the broadcasts, your job is to interpret them. I see. Interpret them? Propaganda. Yes. It was about the fact that this black propaganda unit belied the myth that the Second World War had been fought in this uniquely clean way, which is what every British film had said, more or less from 1945 until Licking Hitler. BIRDS TWEET At the heart of the film is the intense, abusive yet intimate relationship between the upper class unworldly Anna Seaton and the brilliant working-class Scot Archie Maclean. And in the end, Archie tells a lie and she has to go. She has to leave. He tells a lie about her and she gets sacked from the group. And there is this wonderful speech right at the end. It's kind of voiceover about the English and lies. The narrator dispassionately recounts what happened to each of the characters in the years after the war, including Archie, who had gone on to make social realist films that sentimentalised memories of his harsh childhood. I thought the British probably, you know, had a gift for lying and it seemed to me so clear that the establishment, having to justify its continued existence once the empire had gone, could only justify its extraordinary self-importance through lying. Anna enjoyed a career in advertising and was a researcher for the Labour Party before largely withdrawing from society. After seeing one of Archie's films, she wrote to him for the first time since 1942. It is only now that I fully understand the events that passed between us so many years ago. You must allow for my ignorance. I was born into a class and at a time that protected me from even a trance acquaintance with the world. But since that first day at Wendlesham, I have been trying to learn, trying to keep faith with the shame and anger I saw in you. In retrospect, what you sensed then has become blindingly clear to the rest of us. That whereas we knew exactly what we were fighting against, none of us had the whisper of an idea as to what we were fighting for. Over the years, I have been watching the steady impoverishment of people's ideals, their loss of faith. The line, the daily inveterate line. The 30-year-old deep, corrosive national habit of lying. And I have remembered you. I have remembered the one lie you told...to make me go away. And now, at last, I've come to understand why you told it. I loved you then, and I love you now. For 30 years, you have been the beat of my heart. Please, please, tell me it is the same for you. He never replied. And obviously, you know, it has not been very pleasant in the last ten years to see the habit of lying, with ideas of empire returning again and British independence and lies about the Second World War returning again. We are back with the myth. Television drama has always had close links with both the film industry and the theatre. Nearly 30 plays for today were adaptations of scripts written for the stage, including one of the best remembered of all. Hello, Beverly. Hi! Oh, what a lovely dress. Thanks! Were we meant to wear long? No, no, it's just informal, you know. This is my husband, Tony. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. How'd you do? He's got a firm handshake, hasn't he? Yes. Fantastic. Like to come through? Thanks. Abigail's Party is a story outside the play for today's story, really, because it was a stage play. Mike Leigh made a sequence of brilliant films for Play For Today, including the story of Candice-Marie and Keith camping in Dorset. A tale of a bashful mortician's assistant, Trevor, and a chronicle of class divisions among the employees at a brokerage firm. But with his then wife, Alison Steadman, he also created a hugely successful comedy for Hampstead Theatre. Alison Steadman's pregnancy ruled out a transfer to the West End, so Margaret Matheson suggested taking it into a studio for Play For Today. Absolutely out of the question. It is a play, it's a theatre play. It does not belong on television. I'm a film-maker. I don't want to do anything in the studio. And I was talked into it. Everybody said, "You're mad. Let's do it." Laurence, would you put a record on for us, please? Yes, surely. What would we like to hear? Demis Roussos. No, Beverly! We don't want to listen to that fat Greek caterwauling all night. I certainly didn't imagine it was going to become an iconic piece of work. Frankly, successful as it was and much as everybody loves it, I can't watch it. It's a technical, visual mess. But, of course, nobody's concerned about that. What they're concerned with is the resonance of the performances. And here were actors who were so solid in it that they just gave these amazing performances in front of five cameras. SLOW, ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS You don't mind me mauling your husband, do you, Ange? No! You go ahead. Go on, dance with Laurence. No, I can't. Course you can. Get up and dance! Don't worry, Ange, you'll be quite safe with Laurence. He won't rape you. Do you want to dance? Abigail's Party's precisely pitched satirical portrait of the aspirational materialism of the middle classes, has attracted as many brickbats as bouquets. I'm not very good at... Writing as a critic, Dennis Potter described the play as a prolonged jeer, twitching with genuine hatred. Do you want to dance with us? No, thank you. I don't think it's relevant for me or any other dramatist or film-maker to be concerned in a conscious, manipulative way about whether you have to make the audience sympathise with a character or find the character abhorrent. I mean, you know, we put the world, put life, put people on the screen without slogans, and the audience has to decide what he or she or they want to make of it, really. Play For Today also showcased a radically different approach to adapting a theatre show for the small screen. Shot across the Scottish Highlands, The Cheviot, The Stag And The Black, Black Oil brought together 7:84's touring show in a village hall with costume drama reconstructions and documentary film of recent events. # La, la, la, la, la, la, la # La, la, la, la, la, la, la # La, la, la, la, la, la, la # La, la, la, la, la, la, la... # As the rain on the hillside comes in from the sea # La, La, La, La, La, La... # All the blessings of life were eight hours from me # La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... # So, if you'd abandon your own misery # You'd open the door to the oil industry # There's money a barrel of oil in the sea # All waiting for drilling and piping to me...# For the film, director, John McKenzie, reconstructed as a location-shot drama, key moments in 200 and more years of exploitation of the Highlands by the English aristocracy. He wove these together, with the play being performed to a Highland audience to create a compelling tale of capital, the Clearances and Cheviot sheep. And as the play spoke of continuing exploitation, now by American oil interests and the Conservative government down South, Mackenzie intercut contemporary news footage. # Conoco, Aramco, Shell, Esso, # Texaco, British Petroleum-yum-yum-yum-yum # Conoco, Aramco, Shell, Esso, # Texaco, British Petroleum # Conoco, Aramco, Shell, Esso, # Texaco, British Petroleum-yum-yum-yum-yum # Conoco, Aramco, Shell, Esso, # Texaco, British Petroleum # There's job and there's prospects # So, please, have no fears # There's a building of oil rigs # And houses and piers # There's a boom time a-coming # Let's celebrate! Cheers! # Well, the Highlands will be my lands in just four or five years. The 1970s were years of crisis, not just for the country, but for the mainstream British cinema industry. With dwindling audiences, competition from television and cuts to state funding. The truth is, was, that time that you couldn't... There was no indigenous serious British cinema. I mean, there was an industry. mostly used by the Americans or to make very, very commercial product. But, serious indigenous cinema was impossible. And the aphorism that came out of that moment was the British film industry is alive and well and living in television. Drama films were being made elsewhere in television, but Play for Today was an especially congenial context for leading talents, including Alan Clark, who consistently pushed the boundaries of the possible. For Penda's Fen, he brilliantly realised a deeply disturbing dream. KNOCKING ON WOOD The cliche that Play for Today would be every week about some depressing aspect of everything that was worst about British society was just completely untrue. And you'd have a poet like David Rudkin, doing a play like Penda's Fen, which was just wild, crazy and not in any known genre and formerly very experimental, far more experimental than anything that was going on in the British cinema. It was about a sixth-former, which sounds like, you know, death for a drama and his problems with his sexuality, but also with his love of music and also his intellectual growth. And it was set, again, because we were a regional drama, it was set against the Malvern Hills and Elgar's music. You have to be born in us. Then you become pure light. No. No! I am nothing pure! Nothing pure. My race is mixed. My sex is mixed. I am woman and man. Light with darkness. Mixed! Mixed. I am nothing special, nothing, nothing pure! I am mud and flame! If we can't have him, darkness must not. OMINOUS MUSIC Concerned with history and myth, Christianity and romantic literature, politics and gender and landscape... Penda! ..Penda's Fen is perhaps the most extraordinary and fantastical of all Plays for Today. There, you have seen your true dark enemies of England. Sick father and mother, who would have us children forever. King Penda. With Play for Today expected to be contemporary and controversial, censorship skirmishes were inevitable and a number of dramas overstepped the BBC boundaries of good taste and the politically permissible. Two completed dramas were banned outright, although both have subsequently been screened by the BBC. If you are a nervous type out there, switch over or off for some calmer air. But you have to be smug or very frail, to believe that no man has a horn or tail. People would say and people still say, "Well, why did they ban it? And I would say, say the same thing now. Well, it's about a young man, who, incidentally, is the Devil, who cons his way into a rather sad suburban front room, where they're looking after their daughter, who's been in a motor accident, and he fucks her back to life. You still want to know why it was banned? Shh! SHE GROANS Cheque book in bureau, eh, Pattie? SHE MOANS Jewellery in bedroom. SHE GROANS LOUDLY Shh! Keep still now. Keep the gold Krugerrands in the chest of drawers. SHE MOANS Cashpoint card, check card, credit card, oh, it all mounts up, baby. Now, why don't people accept evil when they're offered it? Still, you do. No choice, eh? WHISPERING: No noise, now. No noise. SHE GROANS Evil, I wish to demonstrate, often speaks in sentimental religiose sanctimonious terms. I think that is the characteristic religious approach of shallow-minded people of our time, so that religion is a yucky, unctuous thing, which you don't actually want to know about, and I simply wanted to demonstrate that that was the way, quote, the devil, unquote, the sense of evil would actually be addressing us. I mean, it broke taboos in a most, most extraordinary way, and in the most defiant and loving and self-destructive way, but like so much of what Dennis did, in the self destruction was his salvation and the message was always, you know, that the pennies may come from heaven. Today, the BBC itself has been in the news, as you've probably read in the papers. Alasdair Milne, BBC Television's managing director, and Bill Cotton, the controller of BBC One, have banned a play, already filmed at a cost of £120,000. It was originally to have been transmitted last November. The play's author, Roy Minton, disagrees with the ban, so does Margaret Matheson, its producer, who took the unusual step of defying the BBC and showing a copy to Fleet Street's television critics, last Friday. On my first day, on the fifth floor of the BBC as the producer of Play for Today, I was sitting in the office thinking, "Gosh, OK, here are the slots. What now?". Along comes Alan Clarke and gives me the script of Scum and asked me to read it. The play itself, and we obviously can't show you an extract, is called Scum. Set in a borstal, it's described by its author, as hard, violent and disturbing. Carlin, the main character, is allowed to dominate the other inmates by the borstal officers. It's their way of ruling, and they reward him with special privileges. It was a fantastic piece of writing and certainly a story that should be told in the sense of, if borstal was really like that, then the more people that know, the better. You know, can we live with ourselves if we treat children like that? You know, it was tough to make. It was made... It was filmed in Redhill, in a former old folks' home, which was a pretty grim building and I mean, obviously adapted by us to be more like a prison. The exact order of events I don't remember, but we soon found ourselves talking to Alistair Milne, and we were asked to make cuts, which... ..with a view to ensuring that the film was transmitted. We agreed to make certain cuts. There's a scene, in which Carlin swings... billiard balls in a sock and we were to remove the moment of impact. Carry on. Which you can debate forever, whether it's... OK, that was an easy enough cut to make. There is a rape in the greenhouse... What do you want? ..and we shortened its duration. I'll tell you what we want. SHOUTING And there were two suicides, and, in a sense, this was probably the biggest edit. We took out one of the suicides. This was to satisfy... ..their... You know, Alisdair, and the rest... Their view that there were too many incidents, crammed in too short a space of time for it to be credible. You know, in other words, the nature of dramatic fiction. Wakey-wakey, Davis. Right, Davis. Governor's report. Back in your rooms! Come on, back in your rooms. Put 'em in there! Bang them up, Mr Greaves! Move it, Archer! Eat! Eat or it goes in the bins! So, we made those cuts, but the meetings with Alasdair... ..continued, and... ..eventually, the decision was made that it would not be shown. EAT! Carlin. Carlin, eat! THUMPING Carlin. Carlin! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! But that wasn't made public. And at that point, I arranged for invited press critics to see it, in the Coronet Theatre in Wardour Street. And then, you know, kind of the shit hit the fan, really. Alisdair Milne. Why did you ban the play? On two counts, really. First, that it is an extraordinarily violent piece. and probably one of the most violent we've ever made, and violence can be dealt with in many ways, and can be handled in terms of dramatic expression, in many ways also. That troubled me a great deal when I first saw it, but more importantly, I think, is the point that Peter made in his article this morning, actually. The question I asked at the start, of what truth is this a dramatic expression? Alan Clarke, it's been said that the reason that Scum was banned, was because it was an inaccurate picture of a borstal, a distortion of what a borstal is like. What would you say to that? Well, I don't deny that completely, cos it was... ..just well known now that it was based on about 80 interviews, put together, written as a play. It is a play. It is not a documentary. It's been such a lot of, I think, rubbish talked about, what's a drama? What's a drama? Drama, documentaries and things like that. The thing is, documentary is people... ..is one in which people portray themselves. And the drama is one in which actors are paid to portray other people, Scum was the latter. BLOWS WHISTLE By rights, I should have been fired, but that didn't happen. In fact, I think my kind of street cred went up a lot and the BBC... ..didn't, didn't take me on because there were other productions still... ..in the works. MUSIC: A Message To You Rudy by The Specials A reckoning with the end of the British Empire was central to the politics of the 1970s. Debates about immigration and race informed a number of key Plays For Today, including David Edgar's Destiny - a wide ranging study of the dangers of racism. It was a very strong piece of work which went right to the heart of a debate that was raging at the time about immigration. And so to have a play that so articulately examined the origins and the state, if you like, of the nation... ..on that subject... ..seemed that's what Play For Today was for. NEHRU: At the stroke of the midnight hour when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. Destiny begins in India on the eve of independence, before chronicling the events of a Birmingham by-election in 1977 in which the candidate for the Fascist Nation Forward Party makes a strong showing. The campaign is shaped in part by an industrial dispute at a factory where immigrant workers are a majority. One of the union organisers has a chilling warning for those who are not prepared to express their solidarity with their Asian colleagues. Cos first it'll be the blacks and Asians, then the Jews and Irish. Now, this isn't in these speeches - this is true. And then, it'll be the unions. Oh, make no mistake. The Labour Party, that will go. The others, too. All in the interests of the nation, and to save the nation... ..they'll destroyed the nation. All of it, except themselves. And if we let them... ..we've got ourselves to blame. Our fault. We turned our back. When they said you've got to look at life outside London and you've got to look at contemporary Britain stuff, you could not turn a blind eye to the fact that our cities had changed, particularly Birmingham, but lots of them. And television drama was not reflecting that. Despite the vibrancy of black and Asian theatre in the 1970s, Play For Today offered relatively few major roles for non-white actors, just as was also the case in television drama more broadly. Nor were there many black or Asian writers or creatives. Of the 300 dramas in 14 years of the series, only three - or just 1% - were even part-scripted by non-white writers. Barry Reckord's In The Beautiful Caribbean was one of the early Plays For Today that was wiped after transmission. Both of the other two were directed by Horace Ove, who also co-wrote The Garland and A Hole In Babylon. It seems that the only opportunity a black director has to make a film is always to deal with racism. You know, when the white director has a wider canvas, he can go make a film about anything. And I think black directors would like that same opportunity. A Hole In Babylon is based on the events of what became known as the Spaghetti House siege in 1975, when three black men attempted to rob the managers of a group of restaurants. The film links the crime with a profound racial discrimination faced by black communities and shows how the men understood their actions as, in part, a form of black protest. Come on, brah, let's be realistic. You got a better plan? Well, it's a lot of money, all right. But no guns. Are you mad? Why are you so worried about guns? They kill people. When the white man took your great grandfather from Africa to make him a slave, what did he use? The gun. When he came to our land, what did he use? The gun! How do Smith and Vorster keep control over southern Africa? With a gun. When the white man use the gun against us, they call it law and order. When we pick up a gun to take back what he stole from us, they call it terrorism. We don't have to behave like them. Then stay asleep! When we did these things, we wanted them to be good drama. We didn't want them just to be positive images, cause drama's not about positive images. Most drama's about extremely complex and difficult people. And this whole story is really about the Asian community, first generation, second generation, in Birmingham and why Horace was the right person to do this script, because he'd go out on the street and he'd have the actors, the other cast, and if he saw something strange happening up in...yeah, he'd involve them in that. A divorced Muslim man marries a second wife who has joined him from India. And in the end, she gets deported because of being... She didn't have all the papers, which is very moving. I wish... I wish you'd realise what the hell you're putting that poor woman through. She's... Her marriage in doubt and pregnant. She'll be isolated by most of the people in her village. It's going to affect her state of mind, not to mention her unborn child. Well, I'm sorry. The decision doesn't lie in my hands. Well, why can't we see the person who make the decisions? We have done everything possible in the past one month. Our MP has written to the Home Secretary. We've picketed outside the Home Office. We have done everything possible. We have sent petition after petition. Our lawyer has tried to explain how the whole misunderstanding took place. Look, stop wasting your time and mine. I'm sorry. Time's up now, she can't stay any longer. Come on. SHE SOBS While he was working on Play For Today, Peter Ansorge also produced Empire Road, the first British television series to be scripted, acted and directed predominantly by black artists. I got this call from a decent producer of, of, of Plays For Today, quite good. And he said, "I've read about this Empire Road thing." "Yeah." "And you're absolutely going to regret this for the whole "of your life. He said, "We talked about doing this once "and we realised it was not possible. "First of all, you don't have the actors, any black actor "in this country's terrible. "They won't turn up on time for rehearsals and the audience "will hate it. You will regret this." Now, he phoned me up... HE LAUGHS ..just to say that. And it's puzzled me throughout my life. Why? That was more symptomatic. And it's to do with the fact that they'd never worked with some like Horace. MUSIC: Alternative Ulster by Stiff Little Fingers The endgame of Empire was also played out across the Irish Sea with British troops deployed in Northern Ireland after August 1969. The conflict was important in some 20 Plays For Today. I got extremely fascinated with Northern Ireland by being involved with, there was a minor piece that was one of the early Plays For Today. But I just happened to go to County Cork for a couple of weeks on location and got a feeling of Ireland. And there was Colin Welland, whose relatives lived in County Mayo three or four miles from the border. And there was a perfect story, which was a little bit dependent on the story of Kes, which Colin had been a cast member of about a boy whose parents are killed in Belfast and who is relocated to an even more dangerous part of Southern Ireland. And that gave me an appetite for borders, for the imaginative resources of that, and also for its sheer political fascination with the current political turmoil. So it was something that just, it just preoccupied me intensely for several years. The dominant theme of the Plays For Today set in Ireland is the human toll of The Troubles. And this takes precedence over attempts to reach a political understanding. In Shadows On Our Skin, Joe, a boy from a Catholic family befriends an English schoolteacher, Kathleen. Joe's world is shaped by his alcoholic father's past with the IRA and by a city in which violent conflict is an everyday occurrence. Eventually, Joe betrays a secret entrusted to him by Kathleen, which leads to her being attacked by Joe's jealous Republican brother. You're going away? I'm only bringing my clothes and books. Don't want anything else. Thrown out all the clothes I was wearing last night. If I had the money, I'd throw out everything I owned yesterday. You shouldn't have come! I wanted to go away from here hating everybody very much. Please don't go. Come here... I always meant to give you that. HORN BEEPS That's my taxi. Is it all my fault? Don't suppose it was. One day... One day it'll all be different. The British Army is also a constant presence in one of the first dramas to be shot on the streets of Belfast - a tale of two young women navigating the challenges of the city during one wintry day and night. One of the strengths of Stuart Parker and John Bruce's film is its vivid sense of everyday living and loving in the midst of the conflict. The Troubles in Belfast also framed the acclaimed Billy trilogy by Graham Reid, made for BBC Northern Ireland in the final years of Play For Today. The dramas explored tensions and violence in a Protestant working class family. Come on, Dad. Leave it for the night. You go on up to bed and I'll bring you up some tea. Shove your tea up your arse! You're always on his side. He's in the wrong, but you won't admit it. No. It's always my fault. Tell him! Why didn't you tell him he's in the wrong? Me in the wrong? What are you moaning about you drunken eejit? You haven't been up to see my ma' for over a week! Your ma'?! You and her and your ma'! I wish the whole bloody lot of you had cancer. I wish you were all bloody dying. I go out to work every day. Your ma' never knew what it was like to have a broken pane. No. But she knew what it's like to have a broken jaw and a broken nose. I'm warning you! I'm bloody warning you. Why wouldn't you let her run off with her insurance man? Oh, for goodness' sake, Billy! He was a better bloody man than you! Least he appreciated her. But you couldn't take that. Well, she loved him. She despised you, but she loved him! Billy's father's attack on him is intercut with a fight from years before when he discovered his wife's infidelity with a travelling salesman. I'll kill him! BILLY GROANS Bastard! You ever heard lift your hand to me again, I'll break your bloody leg! CHILDREN CRY Get up! Get out this house before I bloody kill you! DOOR SHUTS CHILDREN CRY SHOUTING CONTINUES INDOORS HE GROANS MUSIC: Tainted Love by Soft Cell # Sometimes I feel I've got to...run away # I've got to... # Throughout the 1970s, questions of sexuality and gender, once seen as essentially personal matters, were increasingly understood as political concerns. Play For Today responded with a handful of dramas about gay lives and a portrait of a young adult recognising they are transgender in the language of the time, transsexual. I have known transsexuals reach 50 without understanding. I've seen them die without understanding. Steven is young! If you care, let him be happy, let him do it. Operations? After the hormone treatment, he'll get... He will be so changed physically that... ..I'm sure the operation will be a mere detail. Mother, it means I can start. I've got something to look forward to. Ha, sure! And as feminism became increasingly central to the lives of British women and of some men Play For Today presented more stories about women's lives that were written and directed by women and by men, too. I had read Ian McEwan's First Love, Last Rites, and I asked him if he would write a drama. He said, I want to write a piece about the position of women and it's going to be set in the war and it's going to be about a woman who wants to fight and is prevented from playing her part in the fight against fascism merely by the fact she's a woman. You know... ..on anti-aircraft units, the AGS girls are never allowed to fire the guns. Their job is to operate the rangefinder. If... If the girls fired the guns as well as the boys... If...if girls fired guns and women generals planned the battles... ..then the men would find there was no morality to it all. There'd be no-one to fight for. Nowhere to leave their... ..consciences. The war would appear to them as savage and as pointless as it really is. The men want the women to stay out of the fighting so they can give it meaning. As long as we remain on the outside and give our support and don't kill... ..the women make the war just possible. Something the men can feel tough about. But I'm withdrawing my support. Well, it hardly matters because we're going to keep you locked up. Such was the world of television four decades ago, that out of 300 Plays For Today, only a dozen were actually directed by a woman. Five were entrusted to the experienced Moira Armstrong, who had also directed productions for the Wednesday Play. The series did moderately better in commissioning women writers, especially in its later years. I slipped one day in my house and gave myself a black eye. In fact, I think two black eyes and I happened to be going to a party that same evening, and they came up very quickly - big. You know, real shiners. And I found a very odd thing happening - that women looked at me sympathetically, but then I gradually realised it was because they thought I'd been bashed. The sort of slightly worse thing was that some, only a few, I'm not saying everyone... But that was a sort of the edge of "Ho-ho, that's what's going on." Going to tell what colour his eyes were? Bet you can remember that? Tell me. I've no idea. Go on, tell me what colour his eyes were, tell me! I didn't notice. I think he was wearing glasses. You think he was wearing glasses do you? You don't remember what colour his eyes were. But you think he was wearing glasses? Yes, I think he was. Michael, you're hurting. Do you think I feel so good about seeing you spend the whole evening with somebody else, obviously enjoying their company a lot more than mine, even looking quite happy. Which you never live with me any more! Do you think that doesn't hurt ME? It's not the same thing. You're hurting me physically! So your body is more important than my mind, is it? I didn't say that, I just said that you were hurting! I'll look and see if the children are all right. So the children are more important than me?! I want to talk to my wife! You think more about those bloody little children than anything. I can't think why you bothered to marry me. You should have had artificial insemination. Would it be just as good and you'd probably have enjoyed it a lot more too! You dried-up old stick! No interest, nothing! You don't even exist. Oh! You'll wake the children. I'll wake my own bloody children if I want to! Are those children more important than me? What about my right? SHE SCREAMS What do you want? You haven't a clue about my problems, have you? You haven't got a clue about my problems! SHE SCREAMS I just had this ordinary couple. And something was going on, but actually it leads to a huge tragedy, although it's so tiny, the steps are small. And the thing about it, the worst thing about it for me, is as the husband starts gradually escalating his violence towards his wife, SHE is the one who feels guilty. She is one, who at the end, is blaming herself for it while he is in denial. WEAKLY: It's my fault. OK, can we get a few minutes of oxygen? Some oxygen. OXYGEN HISSES I'd like to just remember my last meeting with my HR... When I was leaving after through the night, eight months pregnant with twins saying, "Off to have children now." And the... I can still remember his little giggle, as he said... I then worked consistently for the BBC for about nine years and he said, "The legislation to commit to having your job held "for you has gone through Parliament, but hasn't yet received "the Royal Assent," he said, "so I hope you understand that?" And I was very taken aback and I didn't want to come instantly back, but I've never forgotten it. I've thought of it when there are sort of furrowed brows and "why aren't there any women in the top echelons of the BBC?" "Whatever...?" I've remembered that moment. This one's called... Maggie, Maggie, Maggie! Out, out, out! On May 3rd 1979, British politics changed fundamentally with the election of a conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. Deregulation and an enthusiastic embrace of the market would be the new order of the day. Play For Today was also changing. Many more producers contributed dramas, diluting the left liberal consensus that had shaped the series and the strand's response to the new political reality was cautious and tentative. In 1981, one major film did set out to diagnose the state of the nation from the perspective that had been so important to Play For Today. United Kingdom came about because I was friendly with Roland Joffe and I suppose we were trying very immodestly to tell a story about this nation. And I thought there was one area of the kingdom that nobody made a self-conscious political film about, and that was Tyneside. United Kingdom is an expansive tale of a clash between the state and residents of a housing association attempting to resist rent rises and cuts in services. In one scene, the region's Chief Constable addresses a conference about the future of policing. And recent events, and I'm sad to say this, lead me to suppose that this popular support we've always taken for granted is quietly and insidiously being eroded. I'm going to surprise you here. I'm going to illustrate just what I mean. We're at the crossroads. This is the police image that you and I grew up with. You know, the lad who saw us across the road, outside school? We all knew him, didn't we, as kids. But this is the police image of some parts of today's troubled society. Is this to become the norm of our era? And what of the future? What is the image of the police that will be most familiar to our children's children? Will it be this? CROWD MURMUR The community must realise that if we can't police this nation with their support or consent, we will, like our colleagues across the Channel here, be forced... ..onto the offensive. Right, thank you, lads. Eventually, the police move into the housing estate at night, breaking down the barricades erected by the residents. The next morning... The thing is, I mean, what do you get? You get mums and dads and grannies and grandads, they always did what they were told. We'd been taught to do was our grandparents and our parents did. If we did that, what would our kids do? They'd just do exactly what we did. So we've made a stand so that our kids can ask why, they can ask questions when they're older and they're the community. They can ask questions. That's what it's all about. Chief Constable, would you care to comment on last night? Well, as you know, we find ourselves as the men in the middle. And I think under very trying circumstances, we acquitted ourselves well. There's been some criticism that your methods were a little heavy handed under the circumstances. Yes. Well, this was an area where the rule of law and peace had to be re-established, and I think it was done. And I think any fair minded person would be happy with that. Do you not see this as being...? RECORDING: The only way that we are going to solve the deterioration of our situation is through social change, not by the imposition of a baton and a riot shield. Not that. So, what happens next? Well, we'll take the struggle on. We've just lit a beacon here. This is the beginning, not the end. And what you have in the United Kingdom is that attempt, both to play with the form and defy philistinism in critics and at the same time to say something new. Whether we said anything new, I don't know, because it was the very dawn of Thatcherism. And probably from our point of view, she hadn't been able to get under way long enough for us to be able to identify what it was that was so appalling. But it's a film I feel a great deal of affection for. When United Kingdom was first screened, British television for decades just the BBC and ITV, was about to fragment, as first Channel 4 and then cable and satellite channels came on air. Funds for single plays would be harder to find. Mainstream ratings would be ever more important. I think they did depend on the idea that you only had three choices or two choices as to what you could be watching that night. But now, of course, we look back and go, Oh, my God, eight million watched a one-off play about subjects about which they knew absolutely nothing and to which they were introduced for the very first time. And of course, that's revolutionary and exciting. And we knew it was, nobody was in any doubt. Everybody knew how lucky we were to have this wonderful institution called Play For Today. So what has Play For Today left behind? 37 of the early dramas no longer exist. Their recordings wiped to save on shelf space and the costs of tape stock. A videotape tape. On it, a recording of a play - sound and vision. Costing thousands to produce, and now... BUZZING ..wiped. Gone forever, lost. But there are 260 or so dramas. For the most part original, truthful and idiosyncratic that form a collective portrait of the world and the politics and the ideas of post-war Britain and of what it was like to be alive four decades ago. Go on, Pauline. Close your eyes. Close your eyes properly. All right. Surprise, surprise! SMASHING, SHE CRIES OUT OK. GUNSHOTS TV: Britain... No, no, don't! We are right to rejoice tonight at this great victory... ..of the people. And it's right that for a short time, we should relax. But I want to remind you all that when we've had this short holiday, we have to turn to work to win the peace... ..and we've won the war. CHEERING The qualities of unity, self-sacrifice putting the Commonwealth before private interests has to continue into peace... ..after the war. And I want to tell you all that we, in this country, have done a great work in the war. And we are going to face the problems... ..of the peace with the same courage we showed in the war. ELECTRIC ORGAN PLAYS I went. Yeah. It's very ingenious. They've got it in above where they generally put the luggage. You want to go. I don't want to go. That's your trouble. No spirit of adventure. I wonder where it goes. What? You know! I expect it's scattered on the central reservation. THEY LAUGH If anybody is in any doubt in 2020 as to whether the BBC should be scrapped or preserved, they should look back to this period we're talking about where there was complete and proper, respectable, creative and thematic and therefore, political freedom for people to express ideas and explore and reflect society. It's like leaving a bloody battlefield.
