Elizabeth? - Hello. - Hi, I'm Mike Luna. That's Sammy. Would you guys mind stacking it? Sammy, stack it right over here. - That's not our job. - Just do it. Oh, and Mike, could you bring a load into the house? Sure. There's snails on this thing. Are you afraid? - I'm afraid. - Come on. Thank you. Oh, um, not there, by the fireplace would be great. Thanks. It's been so cold these last few nights and I've tried everything to get the fire to light, I just can't. - I'll take a look. - Thank you. How did you do that so fast? Looks like you just had it packed too tight. Throw a log on it before you go to bed, it should burn all night. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Are you from here? Third-generation fisherman. Days are short here in the winter, so I cut wood for extra money. You? I'm a writer. Lots of those around here. Yeah, well, it's a great place to come for inspiration. But I'm not that kind of writer, I'm from New York, I write about fashion. You can see I know a lot about fashion. I don't know anything about fishing, so we're even. But, um, I could be interested. I don't think you'd like fishing. Why not? It's cold on a boat, it's beautiful but dangerous. If you get eight hours of chop like this, you have to keep your wits about you, things could change in a minute and you have to be ready. - Just you and sea. - Sounds kinda lonely. No, it's the exact opposite, but you know what's lonely is being around town with a bunch of people that don't get you. That's lonely. You feel like people in town don't get you? I just wish I was still fishing. - So why don't you? - Everything changes, right? Oh, um, wait wait wait wait wait. - Thanks. - Thank you. Hey, you owe me. For what? From saving you from yourself. Get out of here, what are you talkin' about? Romeo, while I was stackin' up, you were shackin' up. You work pretty fast, bro, huh? No, seriously, you gotta admit she's pretty freakin' hot. - Yeah, she's hot. - She's wicked hot. She would definitely like me. Why don't you go knock on the door, see if she'd invite you in? I will but not today. What, didn't take a shower last night? - But I smell like the ocean. - You're right. That's 'cause I live near the ocean. Yeah! Yeah, look at that! Yeah! That's great! Have you ever seen a tuna that big? I might even have something here for you, youngster! Where you goin'? Just about to give him so much money for it. - Hi. - Hi. Oh my gosh, you gotta see this. Carlos brought in a 800-pound tuna. No, a thousand-million pounds! Thousand-million pounds, huh? No, it was 857 pounds dressed. Dressed, either way they're saying $34 a pound. Carlos is set for the winter. Good for Carlos, come on, everybody, let's get in. - Let's go home. - Okay. - Did you see that tuna? - Nice work, Carlos. Nancy, let's go over to the brig tonight! Drinks are on me! Come on! Look, good job, Carlos, but I gotta get the family home. - Good job, though. - Sore loser. Dad's caught way bigger fish than that. Nice work, Carlos. He's caught really big whales before, like orca whales. Nancy. - Hi. - Kids. I think my dad caught the biggest fish ever caught. - Mike. - Jimmy, how you doin'? - I want you to work for me. - I got other plans, Jimmy. Such as? The cod will be runnin' again soon. I'll be out there again. Not likely, the Department of Fisheries is gonna limit the catch again this season. Did you see what Carlos just caught? You know what's worse than bad luck? - What? - A fluke. A big catch when no one else is taking in anything. It makes you burn your fuel, roll the dice. That day's never gonna come again. You know what? I'm gonna be willin' to roll those dice again. Kids. - Nancy. - Bye, Jimmy. Did you set that meeting up with Jimmy? Nancy, I'm not working for the town. Mike, it's been over a year. If we still had that boat. Mike, the boat was sitting down at the pier rotting. Your sister sold that boat for $5,000. What should we have done, waited until it sank? You should have consulted with me first. Would you like to hear about my day? Yeah, let's hear it. I was at the checkout and I didn't have enough money to pay for my groceries. I'm sorry. I hate this. I hate it. My father was a fisherman, his father was a fisherman. They pulled whatever they could out of that sea. And I'm the only one that can't make it. There's nothin' I can do about it. I hate this, too. But you gotta take the job. Where are you going? I'm just gonna go play with the kids. Come on, I'm gonna get ya. Get over here. Oh, for cryin' out loud. Good god, what is this freakin' crap? Hey, Carlos, you need any help? What do you want? - I got a hangover. - I'm just lookin' for a job. - Anything legal will do. - Go down to Adam's Pharmacy. Second shelf to the left, extra-strength Tylenol. - Carlos, you... - And a cup of coffee, too. Hurry up! Go! Ah, just forget it. Don't ever tell me what to do with my boat, Luna. Hey, buddy, is this your truck? Yeah. You're gonna have to move it. Says who? This parking's for fishermen only, look at the sign. - I'm a fisherman. - Where's your boat? I don't have a boat at the moment, but I'm gonna park here. Okay, unless you have a boat, unless you're actively fishing, you can't park here. Look, I'm not moving my truck for you or anybody. You're gonna have to tow me. Tow's gonna cost you 250 bucks plus $100 citation. - Go ahead, tow me. - Please just move your truck. I'm not moving my truck for anybody, alright? Meredith, what's goin' on? Chief, I'm asking him to move the truck, or I'm gonna tow him. This is Mike Luna, he can park here, he's a fisherman. Alright, I don't know why you bother putting signs up and why you pay me to enforce them. Uh, it's a transitional time. Alright, whatever. How'd you get her, Jimmy? Full time help, you get what you can. You want that job? Towin' cars for people who've lost their boats? I don't think so, Jimmy. I'm buying another boat. What are you gonna do, go out and fish for seals? Come here. I wanna show you somethin'. You know what these are? Yeah, they're baby clams. Good, you passed your first test. I want you to take these, take them out to Hatch's Harbor, I want you to spread them out. I got them in the mail, they're almost on their way out. I think Bill Powers ordered them before he took ill. Am I being considered for this job? Uh, considered? You have his job. Jimmy, come on, me, law enforcement? Think of it as community service. What's this? Congratulations. You're the new shellfish warden. Oh, look at this. It's ridiculous, Jimmy. Your mother would be proud. Christ, Jimmy. Come on! Get outta here! Christ. Hey, everybody. Shh, Mom said not to disturb her. Okay. Your dinner's in the oven. Alright, I'm gonna go take a shower. Diggin' for clams, sir? Yes, sir, yes, sir, I am. You got me, I'm Peter Benedict, I live on Commercial Street. No license? No. I usually get one but I couldn't find you. You see, usually the shellfish warden comes to my door and we buy our license then. Well since you seem to know all the laws, you'll know today is not an official clam digging day. You got me again. What, shall I dump them out? Yeah, dump them out and, uh, let me see some identification, please. Yes, of course. My hands are freezing, can you grab my wallet for me please? It's in the right-hand pocket. Excuse me. I'm really cold. Could we walk back to the parking lot, please? Sure. Peter? Peter? - I'm so cold. - Peter Benedict, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, he's my neighbor. It's Elizabeth Baldwin. I don't know if I can make it. Oh, come on. Mike, I think he has hypothermia. Oh, Christ, he can't be that cold. His lips are blue and... Just put one foot in front of the other, come on, buddy. I think I'm going to pass out. No no no, if we can just make it to my place, I'm right there, we'll get hot tea and a fire. Okay? We're not far, we're not far. One foot in front of the other, come on. One foot in front of the other, let's go, come on. I'm freezing. We'll get you warmed up. Do you want some more brandy in that tea to warm you up? Long we are tossed on the rolling main. ♪ Now we're safe ashore, Jack. Did you two go to boarding school or somethin' together? I'm sorry for my infraction, Mr. Luna. When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no other choice but to become an outlaw. Whoever said that was a fisherman. Or a clam digger. I don't think that Nelson Mandela was a fisherman. Touche! I couldn't remember who said that. I did. Jesus. This all seems rather ironic. I went out in this blustery weather to rake some cherrystone clams, for you. Me? Yeah, to bring over as a welcoming gift. And now here I am sipping brandy discussing Nelson Mandela. Stranger the night. Oh, come on, we've been neighbors for 15 years. I just didn't wanna be presumptuous with somebody as famous as you. I'm not famous. To us wannabes, yeah, you are. I really gotta get goin', I am outta my element here. I'll walk you out. Uh, you want the money for the license? No, forget it. Forget it this time. ♪ Don't forget your old ship mate Excuse me. ♪ Faldee raldee raldee raldee rye-eye-dock - Sorry about all this. - I gotta go. - I wanna see you again. - Alright. Imagine him wanting to give me a fine for digging clams. As if we don't already pay enough on this beach. I mean, if you hadn't come along, he'd have me in handcuffs. What you got? Here's the new licenses, the checks and the cash. Only three licenses? You gotta be kidding me. Jimmy, nobody's digging for shellfish. Mike, you gotta pay 'em pay, their fees pay your salary. I can't make 'em buy licenses, Jimmy. You gotta go door to door. Christ, door to door like a vacuum cleaner salesman? Exactly. The Dyers, the Rogers, the Winthropes, the Baldwins. They all got cottages on the beach, they all dig for shellfish, you gotta walk up to their front doors, you gotta make them pay. 25 bucks won't break them. Jimmy, I just can't do this job, it's not me. Look, hold on, just hold on. This is for your first week. Tonight, half this town's gonna be eating clam chowder with clams they didn't pay for. You gotta make 'em pay, a couple months of this, and your house is saved. You bastard. Don't forget this. You could even take your wife on vacation! How about a frickin' thank you? Seagulls, stop eatin' my clams, get outta here! I just put those out here. I don't think they know where to buy a permit. Right here. - I am the new shellfish warden. - Those criminals. You think this is easy? Why don't you help me chase 'em away? - I will. - Get outta here. Get outta here! Shoo. Go to Nantucket where somebody will love ya! Get outta here! Don't blame me for a shortage of clam chowder. What's the matter with you, Mike, you don't like seagulls? No, I don't, I've never liked them. And now I really don't like 'em, they're eatin' all my baby clams. Oh, that's uh, that's oddly fraternal of you. Well, I am the new shellfish warden. Yeah, I know, there's predators everywhere. Oh, no. I think we're stuck out here. Yeah, the tide's coming in pretty quick. - Look, I'll carry you. - Okay. Gotta rinse off real quick. Um, can you run inside and grab me a towel? - Yeah, okay. - Thanks. Thanks. Oh, I was gonna see if maybe you wanted to come in for a cup of coffee or somethin'. - What are you thinking? - The sound of the water. - It makes me think of my boat. - You miss it? Absolutely, we used to take three, four-day trips, sometimes longer for sword. Pull into the safe harbor, sleep on the boat. There's nothin' like bein' on a boat, it's... It's freedom. You don't feel free? Not like you, I bet you've been everywhere. What's your favorite place to dock your boat? That's easy, Gloucester, up the coast. Why Gloucester? 'Cause fishermen are still treated like kings up there. There's good food, good hard-workin' people. It's a paradise for anyone with a boat. So why don't you just get another boat? That's the plan, eventually. And you? - What do you want? - Family. I was an only child, so I didn't have brothers and sisters, and my cousins always had a lot of brothers and sisters, and I kinda always wanted to know what that would feel like, - you know? - Try havin' four brothers. Sharing everything from soap, clothes, deodorant, girlfriends, sometimes I wished I was an only child. I was close to my mom, we were like best friends. And then she passed away three years ago and it's just been, me. - What about your father? - Father? We don't talk about anything but money. It's the only conversation I think we've ever had. You should have a family, it's my family that saved me. Whatever I've done, whatever I was gonna do, my kids, they washed all that clean. Made everything else seem insignificant. You should have a family. It's just not meant to be. The doctor said I couldn't have any children. Sorry. - Hey. - Hey. - You made it. - You made it. Hang on a second. I gotta take this. - Hello? - Hey. Who is this? Already forgot about me? What are you doin' callin' me here like this? Can you come over? - Right now? - How about later? Look... Look, I'll see what I can do, alright? I'll stop by later, okay? Hey, something's goin' down at the pier. Jimmy needs me to come give him a hand, alright? Dad's always working these days. You know, Jimmy doesn't own you 24/7. Look, I know it's a new job, I'm just tryin' to do a good job for him, alright? You can't shut your phone off for 20 minutes so we can get through a family dinner? You told me to take the job. I'm doin' the job, okay? Good, pick me up a bottle of wine on your way back. I won't be home too late, I promise, alright? Okay, Dad. Hi. Hey, baby. Are you sleepin'? I'm sorry I'm late, okay? Hi. What do you say we take a trip down Cape this weekend? I got the next couple of days off. - Okay. - Sound good? Yeah. Are you comin' up? No. Alright, goodnight. I'll get the light. You lookin' for Mike? Who? Remember me? Um, right yeah, you're um... Sammy. Sammy, right. You lookin' for Mike? Uh, no no, I was uh, just lookin' for a clam license. Clam license? Sorry, I'm a little high. It's alright, I, uh... I don't smoke, I mean I have, I just, I just haven't a while, you know? But don't worry, I'm not judging you or anything. Do you want some? Not here. I'll give you two for later. Okay. Sure. - What was your name? - Elizabeth. Nice to see you again, Elizabeth. Nice to see you. So how much do I owe you? Nothin'. - Talk about it another time? - Alright. Thanks. Mike's down Cape with his wife. Wanna start fishing again, Mike? Well, Jimmy told me it's for sale. $900 a month and we can own it outright in five years. You're serious? It's time. Thank you. How many times do I have to call you before you answer the phone? Hey. You alright? Yeah, I'm just tired from the trip, let's go home. Yeah, me too. Let's go. Sammy, what's goin' on? Whoa, what's up, Jimmy, what'd I do? I'll think of somethin'. Come on, I was on my way somewhere. Where? - I don't know, somewhere. - Yeah, just what I thought. Look, Sammy. Tell me, you still getting your stuff from the same place? What are you talkin' about? Alfredo, he still your connection? Who's Alfredo? I don't know an Alfredo. Look, Sammy, don't play with me. Take two steps back here. Your drugs, are you gettin' them from the same source? Don't lie to me, I'll take you in right now. Same guy, nothing's changed. Alright, you let me know if and when anything changes. You know, Jimmy, I want a real job. You got Mike a sweet gig workin' for a town, what about me? - Can't you help me out? - He's got no criminal record. What, protective custody, a disorderly? That's nothin'. You think Mike's an angel workin' on the job? - Somethin' goin' on? - I don't know, maybe. Hey. Hey there, Officer. - Yes, sir. - I saw a guy fishin' here. And uh, yesterday, and I don't know what he was tryin' to catch, but he was usin' some sort of bait and I was wonderin' if you knew what kind of bait he was usin'. I'm sorry, I can't tell you but if you ask for Jerry down at the tackle shop, he'll help ya. - Oh, Jerry? - Jerry. - Jerry at the tackle shop? - Yeah. You know, that's the way to do it. So, Jerry's the guy to talk to? - Yeah, talk to Jerry. - Where have you been? Excuse me? Too busy to return my calls? Uh, I'll see ya around, okay? Yeah, you're great. Sorry, I'm workin'. What did you see? I don't know, I was down by Dyer's Cove. - You saw Mike when? - It was about a week ago. What is he doin'? He's driving, he's walking, what did you see? He parked his car and he walked to the end of the path. And? About an hour later, he left. - You were there for an hour? - Yeah. What then? Then, a woman came down the same path, got in her car and left. Who? The Baldwin woman. So? And, don't you find that a little weird that Mike's hangin' down there at this time of year, with the lady? I tell you this much, they ain't goin' fishin' together. No, not at all. Look, you just saw Mike walkin' down a path. Don't make conclusions, you're too stupid. Hey, if you don't wanna trust my good information, that's on you, brother. Go back to doin' nothin' like you always like to do. Get outta here. Good to see ya, Jim. I mean, what kind of woman calls your husband's phone and yells at him, other than his wife? - Am I being irrational? - Did you ask him about it? I don't wanna ask him about it, I mean, what if it's work related and I'm just being paranoid? I never thought I'd end up here. You know, for a second there it sounded like you were getting sick of me. No, I'm not. I gotta get goin'. Well, you're in a hurry, how was your trip? - What? - Down Cape. With your wife. What, did you go looking for a boat? - Yeah. - Yeah? - So why bring her? - I don't understand. Well, why wouldn't you bring me? She's my wife, I've got obligations. Obligations, okay. So that's what they're calling marriage these days, right? So what's that make me? Am I the mistress? You're crazy, come on. I'm crazy? Right, yeah, I'm crazy because I ask questions, so I'm crazy.

What's goin' on here? What's it look like? Haven't seen or heard from you in over a week. I get it, I get the picture. Let me guess. It's not me, it's you. I just think our situation is impossible. - Why? - What are you gonna do? Are you gonna take me to New York City? Parade me around to all your friends? Your fisherman woodcutter trophy? Look, they'd just laugh at me. This has been great, really, I just, I can't do this anymore. You know why this is impossible? Because you never were gonna leave your wife. You have to understand something, I live here. I always have and I always will. So, what? This was just easy sex for you, right? I get it. It was fun. And that was fine. But things change. Yeah look, I know, things have changed for me, too. I just can't. I'm pregnant. What? You're pregnant? Is it mine? Are you kidding? There's always that guy Peter that's hanging around here. No, Mike. I haven't had sex with anyone but you in the last six months. What are you gonna do? - I'm keeping it. - Of course you are. Mike, of course I'm gonna keep it. Of course you're gonna keep it, of course. Look, I told you, I want a family more than anything. And I thought it was impossible, but, I'm pregnant. And look, I'm sorry that it's with you, trust me, I'd rather it be with anybody else, but, without you, this wouldn't be possible. So, thank you. I gotta think. Don't worry, you don't have to think.

I'll stop by later. Okay. Okay, yeah. - Milk and eggs. - Thanks, honey. Hello. I, um, I just wanted to thank you, Mr. Luna. I'm going to look into that. Yeah, sure. Excuse me. Mm-hm. Who is that? Christ, I don't know. I should have taken off my jacket before I came in here. People think I work 24/7. This isn't who I am. Mike, relax. It's a jacket. Change it before you leave the house. Is Elizabeth home? She's resting. It's not a good time. I'll come back later. Do you wanna leave a message? Hi. Hey. I thought I heard you. Is he the new daddy? - Peter? - Yeah. No, he's just a friend. - Does he know that? - He knows you're the father. Elizabeth, we're goin' on a walk, are you coming? Go ahead and take Henry down the beach. I'll meet you in a minute. Henry? Yeah. It's a great name. Yeah. It's after his grandfather. - He's a handsome boy. - Yeah, like his daddy. You haven't changed. You look great. I've missed you. This isn't why I came here. So I take you still have, uh, obligations? How long are you in town for? - Depends. - Depends on what? I don't wanna play games. I'm not playing games. My father died and left me the house. - So you're staying? - That's the plan. Right now. Ever since I've had Henry, I haven't been able to work as much as I used to and the house is paid off, so it just makes sense. Look, uh, you're busy. I'll come back another time. When? I don't know, but please, whatever you do, just don't come down to my work, okay? Who's that? - There's Mommy. - Hey. What did he want? He wanted to see Henry and me. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm great. Elizabeth, I don't think you know him. You know, could watch Henry for a little while? - I have to go out. - Of course, but Elizabeth. You have a child now, think about what's right for Henry. I am thinking about what's right for Henry. Get over here. Jesus. Oh. Um. Did you plan a dinner for us? Something light and easy. I would have prepared something more extravagant, but uh, Henry had me read him six books tonight. The little rascal didn't wanna go to sleep. I think he was missing his momma. Look, Peter, I really do appreciate all of this, but I... Can I get a rain check? How about a glass of wine? I'm just so tired. Is he coming over? Well, if he is, I'm not gonna be much company, because I'm goin' to bed. No, just leave it, just leave it, just leave it. I'll deal with it tomorrow. Okay. I'll put a log on the fire before I leave. Hi, can I help you? Uh, yes. A friend of mine has a child with a state employee, so she just wanted me to come in here and pick up the forms for medical insurance for the dependent. Who's the employee? Aren't all the forms the same? No, they're not. It actually depends on the level of the employee, are they a level one employee or a level two employee? I don't know. And there's also different plans to choose from, different deductibles and other variables. What is the relationship to the employee? - Does that matter? - Mm-hm. Okay, wait just one moment. Go ahead and fill these out and bring them back. These are only for the employee to see. Remind the employee not to forget to fill out the backs. Thank you. Thanks. What are you doing here? Well, hi to you, too. Here, fill those out and then hand them back to me - when you're done. - What the hell are these? Insurance forms? Yeah. Henry needs insurance. Christ, can't you get this some place else? The whole town's gonna know my business. No, I can't, I lost my job, okay? And I'm not poor enough to afford the state insurance, and I'm too rich to get a good plan. How much do you want? Are you trying to pay me off so I'll go away? You knew I was married when this affair started. You told me you couldn't get pregnant. Look, life changes, I know, it's changed for me, too. Is this all you want, the insurance? Wow. It really is over. You don't feel anything for me anymore, do you? No. No. I love my wife, and my family. Henry is your family. Shit. Tell Nancy, she's gonna hear about it eventually. It's better she hear it from you than someone else. Jimmy, I just can't do it. It'll break her heart, it'll be the end of us. You want that strange woman making your life's decisions for you? Go home, tell your wife what you did. Um, well, we talked about peace, reconciliation. It's important to think about that. Tag, you're it. - Here I come! - Come get me! Somethin' I've been wantin' to tell you for a while now. - Hey, Bryce? - Yeah, what? - Be careful. - You're it. You're it. Look, when I took the new job... Can you believe how tall Christina's getting? Nancy. Look at her. She's just so tall. She's beautiful. - Just like her mother. - What did you wanna tell me? Look, Nancy, it's bad. Did you lose your job? No, no. I didn't lose the job. Don't tell me you're in trouble with the police. No, it's worse, Nancy. What? I had an affair. It was three years ago, I never meant for this to happen. It's over. You what? You had an affair? There's more, she got pregnant. There's a little boy. You're kidding me, right? His name's Henry. Do other people know? Yeah, look, Nancy, I'm sorry. How could you do this to me? How could you do this to us? I don't know what I was thinking. You know, you told me you were working. You weren't working. You were playing. You were having your way with some woman. Mom, are you alright? No. We're leaving. Bryce, come on, we're leaving. You too, Mike. Get in the car. Can the kids stay with you tonight? What did he do now? I'll call you later. - I'll speak to you. - Bye bye. Come on, give grandma a kiss, come on. Give me a hug. Look at me, be good for Grandma. - No fighting. - Okay. Thanks, Mom. God damn you, Mike Luna! You can find somewhere else to sleep. I hate you! You're a cheater! How could you do this to me? Get outta here! You liar! Christ. Don't you ever come back! Hello. Are you Elizabeth? Yes. Do you know who I am? I do. Well, then I'll just make this really easy. Did you have an affair with my husband? Yes. Can I see him, the child? I don't think we're gonna be staying for that long. Well, Elizabeth, I don't really think that's how that works. How what works? Parental rights. You know, Mike might not be the perfect husband, but he's a wonderful father, and so I forgive him. But not you. Oh my god, oh my god. Well... Wasn't that just charming. Not now, Peter. It's what you wanted, isn't it? Were you spying on me? Why don't you let me in like that? I could love Henry just as much as he and I would let you live your life. Live my life. What? With you? Is that what you want? I don't want a life with you. You're still in love with him and you can't stand the fact that he loves his wife. You want the things that you can't have. I wish it were me. What am I supposed to do, am I supposed to cry for you now, really? No, I am as big a man as Mike Luna. Strength is in what you don't do, not what you do. Have you lost your mind? Get off me! Jesus! Elizabeth... I'm sorry. I would never hurt you or Henry. Elizabeth! You see this bag? You. This bag, your life is in this fuckin' bag. - I got it, I got it. - You are a nut. Now I won't expect anything other than you to be responsible for this bag, you get it? Don't worry about it. Fuck you, you bastard. Hey, Elizabeth. - It's uh... - Sammy, Sammy. Sammy, hi. - Is that Mike's kid? - Yup. - He's a cute kid. - Thank you. I got a boy of my own, cool boy. Kinda like father like son, you know? He lives down in Hartford, Connecticut with his mother, but I'm thinkin' now that I'm doin' better, you know, maybe he could come start live with me, you know? Right. - Are you lookin' for Mike? - No, no, I'm just sittin'. 'Cause I'm pretty sure he's down by the bar. If you give me a ride, I could probably find him, if you're lookin' for him. Oh, I'll give you a ride, yeah, sure. Yeah, hop in. Cool. He ain't in there. It's okay. I'm gonna get the kid home. Alright, thanks for the ride. Yeah, sure. See ya. What the hell is this? Nothin'. What are you doin', are you digging clams? No. What the hell are those, have you got a license? - No. - Dump 'em out! Christ, you can't dig clams without a license. Jesus, I didn't think anyone cared. Anyone cared? That's stealing, alright? This is my job, alright, that's stealing. Dump 'em out, some time today! Don't ever let me catch you digging clams here without a license, alright? You got it. Get outta here. God damn it. Mike. I'm sorry. 'Cause I'm in love with you, and, and I know you don't want me to stay here, and I know you don't want me at all. So I'm gonna go. It's alright. I didn't mean to hurt you. Carlos. What's up? Not really a big deal, but uh, we're gonna get it back... We're gonna get what back? I just, I kinda left the bag in... You what? I know where it is, I know where it is! Where did you leave the bag? I think, I'm 99% sure I left it in Elizabeth... 99, you'll be 100% sure. Come on, where is it, in her house? - I think it's in... - Let's go, come on. Look, 99% sure that my orange backpack has the stash in it in her car, alright? You better pray my stash is in her car. You stupid knucklehead. I said I'm sorry, alright? I'm sure it's in there. I should have never trusted you. I'm sorry but she'll be home soon, she's with her kid. Where are you goin'? Relax. I'm just checkin' things out! She's got my stash, doesn't she? - Dude. - What happened, what? - We gotta get outta here. - Why, why, what? Get in the car. There's a baby in the car. Forget about the baby! - It'll freeze to death. - Come on. Hurry up. It's alright, it's okay. It's gonna be okay, I promise. Don't worry, don't worry. Carlos? Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! Why did you do this to me, where'd you go? Carlos! Henry? Henry, hey, hey, I'm here. Come here, boy. Oh my god, no. Elizabeth. Hello? What? What do you mean? Yeah, I'll be right there. I was here with her, we had a fight, and she asked me to leave but I knew she didn't mean it. If only I would have been with her last night, she'd still be alive. She needed me. I know it. She was frightened of Mike Luna, that bastard, I could have stopped him. If only I would have stayed, she'd still be alive. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I wasn't the man I needed to be. He did it. He did it, murderer! It wasn't me, I didn't kill her! You killed my Elizabeth! Elizabeth! No, no! No! Don't jump to conclusions! Oh, look who's coming. There we go. Oh yes, it's fine. He's your responsibility now, Nancy. You, sit down. Sit down. It's gonna be okay. - It's gonna be okay. - No, please. Please, no. He did it! - What are you doing? - Sit down. - That's the murderer! - Sit down. Sit down. Henry! Henry! No! It's gonna be okay. Are you a good boy? Yeah, you're a good boy. I gotta get the car seat. Be careful, don't let him touch anything. I'm just getting the car seat. I swear I didn't mean this to happen, man. Mike, I'm sorry to come in like this, man. This is bad, Mike, this is bad, bro. She's dead. I swear I didn't do it, man, you gotta believe me! Who did this, Sammy? Who did this? I can't tell you, man, I'm screwed! You're screwed anyway, alright? I saw your backpack in her car. Sammy. I didn't mean for none of this to happen, I swear, I was just tryin' to get my stuff back! The baby's so cute. So cute, I grabbed the baby, brought it back in the house. I went back in the house, somebody stabbed her, she was stabbed, she was on the floor! If you didn't have anything to do with this, we'll talk to Jimmy and we'll get it all straightened out, alright? If I tell Jimmy, I'm goin' to jail, man. I left a bag of blow, I left a whole ounce in her car! - Sit down. - The cops? Sit. - Oh, shit! - Sit down, it's Jimmy. Gonna go to jail! Sit, just calm down. I'm gonna go talk to Jimmy. Where is he? He's right there! He's heading west on Commercial. I'm losing him, where's my backup? Back. - We lost him. - No, he'll show up in town. He's got nowhere to go. He's just a mixed up kid, Jimmy. There's no way he did this. Just look after your own kid. You want Henry growin' up wondering if the person who killed his mother is still out there? I'm gonna keep lookin' for whoever did this, even if you're not. Don't end up a suspect, let it rest, alright? Go home, this chapter of your life is over. You guys see that big church right over there? - Yeah. - You mean the library? Nah, that used to be a church. A lot of people used to pray there. Why, Dad? Sometimes, uh, people prayed 'cause they have problems they couldn't solve by themselves, - they needed a little help. - Like what? Sometimes, uh, men would go out to sea, to fish, and they wouldn't come back. Why? I don't know, maybe they got lost in a big storm or something, you know? Maybe they went to heaven. Yeah, maybe they did. Yeah, they probably went to heaven. ♪ All at once you see ♪ Your life flashing before your eyes ♪ And glows in the tears that sting ♪ And your nose, it burns ♪ As the years turn ♪ Into songs that fade away ♪ Before you can learn all the words ♪ And dance to the rhythms you've heard ♪ All along you have played ♪ These songs unafraid of the end ♪ And now it begins ♪ Before you can learn all the words ♪ And dance to the rhythms you've heard ♪ All along you have played ♪ These songs unafraid of the end ♪ And now it begins ♪ Now it begins ♪ Now it begins
