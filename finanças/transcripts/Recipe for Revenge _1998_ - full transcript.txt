Oh, oh, he's something, that bad Bob. Felix the lock-- the lock,you have to unlock here. His voice, every time I hear him speak I get the feeling of a tingle. What's he look like? A warthog. [SHOCKED] No! I hear he's being sued for sexual harassment. MRS. KOSLINSKI: The man loveswomen, why is this a crime? The issue is consent, Mrs. K. Excuse me? [laughs] Have we met? He's from the city, somethingabout a license, I don't know. A license for what? It's not a restaurant, sir. This is my kitchen. I cook here. This facility is also usedfor commercial purposes? No. Dinner for a few friends and neighbors. I'm afraid it's gone beyonda few friends Miss Hunter. We at the licensing bureaualso listen to the radio. It's a giveaway. It's a promotion. And this is a viable commercial enterprise. And we will require aGH16/4HW/3 classification F, which you can apply forat the city licensing bureau. All right. Well, how much? $1,200, have a nice day. [LAUGHING] What- twe-- What? I don't have $1,200. I don't have $12. [sighs] [phone ringing] I should of stayed at Francesco's. Well, Francesco wouldtake you back in a flash. Oh, yeah. He'd love that, wouldn't he? [MOCKING FRANCESCO] What you think you don't need me after all I've done for you? You'll never survive without Francesco. He's right. Who is it? It's, uh, Sophie. I would rather run a hot dog stand. Sophie? SOPHIE: [inaudible] Sophie? Sophie, calm down. Well you can't-- don't worry,you can't screw up veal scallopini, it is idiot proof. I don't understand. I did everything you said. This is not how I traditionally serve veal scallopini. Yeah, I- I- I rolled it inthe flower, then I- then I threw in the veggies and stuff. - After you browned the veal?- Browned? Browned. You mix olive oil and butter, and you cook the meat until it's brown? And then you add the basil and the stuff. I thought you did that at the end. No. No. See, it's difficult to brownthe meat after it's been, uh-- Well, you didn't say that. I just assumed you knew. But you're right sorry, I didn't. It's 20 minutes. He's going to be here in 20 minutes. I mean-- I- I made a wholebig deal about serving him a home cooked meal. He's going to think I can't cook. You can't cook. All right. OK. Uh, you go and fix your hair. Oh my god my hair! I'll see what I can do. [music playing] OK. Let's see what we got. [laughs] Holy chow. Oh my god, Carly, you are a genius. What is it? Linguine chinois avec blue cheese sauce. Now look, Sophie, whenwhat's his face arrives-- - Tobias. - Tobias. Just boil the water. Mhm. Cook the pasta, add the butter-- - Mhm. - --and the cheese. Mhm. Why, where are you going? To rob a bank. I'm 1,200 bucks short of aGH16/48W classification F. No, Carly, please? It's fine, just add the dressing. And listen, don't forget to boil the water before you cook the pasta. No, Carly, you can't gobecause I'll get confused and I'll just mess it all up. I know I will. It'll just be a big disaster, please! Shh, wait, wait, confused about what? [doorbell] No, that's Tobias. Carly, please, please, don't go. I'll pay you. How much? Whatever you want. OK, first things first. Get a cocktail into him. Cocktails, OK. Carly, don't let him see you. [groans] It's a living-- SOPHIE: [laughs] I'll just go give the pasta a little stir. TOBIAS: Here, let me help you. No, no. No. No, uh, too many Cook's, you know what they say. You just finish your wine, and,uh, I'll be back in a flash. [exhales] [MOUTHS] Thank you. OK, here we are. [doorbell] [doorbell] Coming! Chester? What are you doing here? CHESTER: Aren't you going to invite me in? CARLY: No, I am not. I am going to ask you to please leave my house, and leave me alone. CHESTER: Who's he? Tobias Macneish, Chester Winnifield. TOBIAS: Hey, I've seen you on TV. You're the sex therapist. That's right. TOBIAS: What are you doing here? Actually that's none of your business, and if you wouldn't mind running along, Sophie and I have a few thingswe'd like to talk about. No, Chester, we have nothing to talk about because we're through. Sophie, please, do not humiliate yourself. After all the work we've beenthrough, nurturing your self image, here you are once again declaring yourself unfit for love. I am fit for love,Chester, just not with you. You are so close to being healed, I don't want to let you slideback into self loathing. The only person I loathehere is you, now get out! You heard her. Nobody ever leaves me, Sophie. I told you that. [gunshots] How do you know it was Winnifield? Well, I saw him. You know him personally? Everybody knows him. He's Got a TV show andbooks and professor passion. Did you know that he andMiss Weston had been involved? No. But I did know that she wantedto impress Tobias-- um, Tobias. I was hiding here in the kitchen. I don't understand. [laughs] She wanted him to think that she was cooking like Cyrano de Bergerac. That's not a real person. I know. So Tobias falls in love with your cooking and thinks it's miss Weston? All right. You're sure thatWinnifield didn't see you? He would have shot me too. OK. I'm going to have someone drive you home. I saw it. I didn't do anything. I just watched. [SOFTLY] Hey, don't do that. Don't blame yourself. You did the only thing you could have done. OK? CARLY: I'm OK, honestly, thank you very much. You've been very kind. You're welcome. Thanks officer No problem. Do you want some tea? Yes please. You should have seen! There was this great newsFlash, and then they said Sophie Westin and the address. And then I said to Felix,isn't that where Carly is? ELLIOT: Uh, Mrs. K. Yes? No. Yes, of course. Of course. You poor darling. You need a little pick me up. A little drop of gin, huh? Th-- Thank you Elliott. Here-- I saw some linguine in the fridge, do you want me to heat it up?- No. Thank you. Would you mind just sitting here with me a little bit before you go home? Sure, yeah. Of course. I didn't do anything. I just stood there. Of course I knew her. She was a client of mine for three years. Were you also lovers? She loved me. I'm afraid it wasn't mutual. It's an occupational hazard. Were you intimate? No. She had a profound self-image problems. But she was making progress. And where were you tonight Dr. Winnifield? The clinic. By yourself? With a client. And her name? Miss Jeffreys. Just the two of you then? My assistant was there. Miss Lansbury? Yes. Do you often work at night? I try not to, but missJeffreys is a new patient, she wanted to see me, so Itried to accommodate her. And where did you go after the clinic? Came straight home, poured myself a scotch, turned on the news, andfound out about poor Sophie. Do you have any ideawho might have done this? No. Why would anybody want to kill Sophie? Well, it's usually either money-- Or love. Or love. Well, I think that's it. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Oh, um, you said her name was Jeffreys? Ida. Ida. OK, great. Thank you. TV REPORTER: This car wasseen parked outside the Westin house, and here in this WNKW exclusive we can see the driver of that car, believed to be Carly Hunter herself, being led away from themurder scene by city police. However sources close to Sergeant Jack Brannigan continue to claim the cut rate caterer is not the prime suspect. The cut rate caterer-- it's started already. Wait 'til they find out about Winnifield. Winnifield's story check out? Yeah. He says that he was at his clinic 'til 9:30. Confirmed by his personalassistant Allison Lansbury, who was also there, so she says. Now her logbook confirms thesession with Ida Jeffreys. Do you think he's sleepingwith either of them? I tell you-- I'd say Ida Jefferies for sure. But Lansbury is an old flame, I mean, I think they'd say anything he wanted. But their stories hold? Yeah, so far. Five bullets fired, .38 caliber, all recovered. Now Winnifield owned a gun, but reported it stolen two years ago. A .38. And we've got his palm printsall over the Westin house. But he and Sophie did someof their therapy sessions there, right? Oh, come on, jack. Give me a motive. This is Chester Winnifield. He can have any woman he wants. Except Sophie Westin, according to what Carly Hunter overheard. So Sophie dumps him, andhis ego couldn't take it? Maybe he thought it was bad for business. No one saw him enter or leave the house. We have no weapon. We have an eyewitness. Who admits to being in the house when the murder was being committed. Who had a reason to be there. Who called the police. Who has offered to cooperatein any way that she can. What else do we know about her? She did the Cordon Bleu course in Paris. Worked in France for a couple of years, came back here and got a job asa pastry chef at Francesco's. I love Francesco's. Anyway she, uh, left, uh, had a falling out and started her own catering company. Married? Single, no kids. Lonely type? Solitary? Everyone that I talk to liked her. Except Francesco, but he's been in business ever since she left. Plain-Jane? Femme fatale? I see. Pretty girl. Just keep an open mind Jack. Always. Jack? It's going to be her word against his. If I go into court againstChester Winnifield, I do not intend to be made a fool of. I know, I know. So this is the first time you saw him? I told you. In person, yes. You were never a client of his? No. No personal connection whatsoever? No. Would you consider Sophie a close friend? No, not really. I catered some business functions for her. I liked her. Strictly business then? What else? I don't know, what else is there? Nothing. What are you getting at detective? My problem with Miss Jeffrey's story is that there's no record of hercalling you from her apartment last night. Maybe she used a cell phone? Hm. But if she was at home why wouldyou call you on a cell phone? More to the point, why would she lie? And why would I lie? I don't know. Unless, of course, I shotSophie and Mr. Macneish. That would be a reason, yes. Chester I remind you you're here voluntarily, you don't have to answer. But why would I kill them? Because she dumped you. Oh come on, Jack, ifyou want to go fishing get a boat and a bucket of worms. Why exactly did you leave Francesco's? Because he used cheap ingredients, and he charged too much,and he didn't pay me enough. And what the hell does he have to do with this? I understand you threatened him? No, it wasn't a threat. I smacked him with a cheese grater. How long have you had a gun license? 20 years. You ever buy a gun? Once in 1991, it was a .38. HENRY: You know that gunwas stolen two years ago? I know that it was reported stolen. Have you ever owned a gun? No. I wouldn't know how to use one. You don't honestly believethat I shot them, do you? And Chester Winnifield is a murderer. Did you know that there wasno weapon found at the scene? Oh, don't tell me. They were shot with a .38? All right, that's enough. You offered to help in any way you can, and now he's trying to incriminate you without a shred of evidence. Henry, they have an eyewitness. Somebody who saw thewhole thing, and now she's blaming me. He has an alibi. Well he's lying. He's too cool. What about this eyewitness? Relax. He's yanking my chain, it's psychology 101. Oh, god. There's a mob out there. Let's go the back way. Henry? I've got nothing to hide. OK. Don't speak to the media. Don't talk about this to anyone. In fact the best thing ofall would be to lay low. It's hard to cook when you're laying low. I'll arrange for non-listed number. I can't have an unlisted number, I run a business out of my apartment. JACK: Maybe you should put yourbusiness on hold for a while. What? No, I'm sorry. I just got this thing off the ground, if I put it on hold I can kiss it good bye. Hi. - Who's he? Elliot Saunders, my neighbor. You live in the building? Across the hall. OK. I'll be in touch. No, no, no. Go out the back way, come on. Maybe I should take home. No, I'm fine. Thank you. FEMALE REPORTER: What about thewoman who was in the apartment? Is it true that she'saccusing you of the murders? [interposing voices] My understanding is that she is a caterer who was cooking for Sophie. Now, whether there was somethingmore to this relationship, or how and involved me I-- FEMALE REPORTER: There she is-- [interposing voices] HENRY: Chester, I advise against this. CHESTER: Henry, duly noted. Don't do it FEMALE REPORTER: Are you Carly Hunter? MALE REPORTER: Did Winnifield know that you and Sophie were lovers? FEMALE REPORTER: Was it a threesome? What about the bloody glove? CHESTER: Miss Hunter. Chester Winnifield. I know who you are. Why won't you shake his hand? FEMALE REPORTER: Yeah, whywon't she shake your hand, doc? The police say you saw something? You know what I saw. No, I don't. Why are you blaming me? Don't you think we shouldbe helping one another? Eugh! CHESTER: If we help one another we could get to the bottom of this, if-- For anybody who read mysecond book, Fear of Fantasy-- Follow me. Come on. OK. Let me go first. OK. Step up, Carly. Come on. This way. In here. What-- what is-- where are we? In the attic. In the attic? [laughs] It's-- CHESTER: It's OK. Wow. Is this what you do when you can't pay the rent? Yeah, something like that. Cool. I'm a cool kind of guy. Yeah. Yeah. [laughs] All clear. All right Thank you verymuch, I really appreciate this. Scoot. [sighs] [music playing] ANSWERING MACHINE: You have 25 messages. BOB: Carly, my little tartlet, bad news is our three contest winners all pulled out 'cause of this murder business. But there's no such thing as bad press. SID: Carly, it's Sid Harrisfrom the Harris agency. It's crucial we talk ASAP in terms of putting together a complete package. LONNIE: Carly, this is LonnieGeffan, I'm a defense attorney. You've probably seen me on Heraldo. BELL: Carly, this is BellGiddlesone, we, uh, in terms of dinner next Friday, we, uh, well we may be going to Florida, and, uh-- well, we'll be in touch. MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Sugar, spice, and everything nice go in to cookies and cake. Also do fibs and dirty liesdo a dead caterer make. Remember, Carly, you can run, you can hide, but you can't get away from me. ELLIOT: Carly? [gasps] Jesus, Elliot, don'tsneak up on me like that. I'm sorry I-- I just wanted to see if you were all right. I heard that. It's a crank. They'll call somebody else tomorrow. ELLIOT: That is ridiculous,and you know it. Listen, Elliot, if I call thepolice they're going to put me under wraps until God knows when, and everything that I workedfor will just go up in smoke. Things will change. Then move in with me. I m-- I don't mean-- for now, at least I can take care of you, and you can run Carly'screations from next door-- That's very sweet of you, Elliott. But they haven't driven meout of here, not yet anyway. OK, I understand. The offer is always open. You are so cool. [laughs] But it's probably somepsycho fan of Winnifield's just trying to scare me off. It's-- don't worry. I'm going to be fine, OK? Well, I'll uh-- I'll just be across the hall. If you need me just holler. Help! [laughs] Like that? That would do it. OK. Bye. And you've, uh, checked into all of this with a fine toothed comb? There were four people in herapartment when Sophie called. They all confirm her story. So she's got her alibi and he's got his. Look, I believe her. I know you do. So do you. So give me something or I can't charge him. Thought I'd takeanother shot at Lansbury. The long suffering ex-mistress? If she's lying to protect him that makes her accessory double homicide. Oh, well, she's not going to betray him. Not if she's still under his spell. Maybe she won't be if she'spersuaded that he really loved Sophie enough to kill her. Hell hath no fury. Something like that. Jack if you're wrong about this-- I know, I know. I'll be pounding the beat in Dubuque. Just be careful. Thanks. MRS. KOSLINSKI: Yoo-hoo! - Mm. - Mrs. K? MRS. KOSLINSKI: Hm? Try this. Mm, mm, needs sugar. Do you have another beer, darling? It's a lemon sauce,it's supposed to be tart. Hey, come here. A shocking turn of events in the Westin Macneish double murder. After two weeks of intensivequestioning police today arrested and charged Dr. Chester Winnifield with two counts of murder one. The best selling author,TV star, and sex therapist was taken into custody at his Forest Hills mansion just moments ago. Now the key to his arrest was this woman, Allison Lansbury,Winnifield's one time paramour and longtime assistant. Last night Lansbury agreed toturn state's witness in return for immunity after police confronted her with phone records, whichsuggested she had been lying to protect Winnifield. Well it was enough for thepeople's primo crime buster Violet Spiri who decided toput Professor Passion on ice. Now the key to-- - That's you. TV REPORTER: --this whole caseremains Carly hunter, former pastry chef at Francesco's. Infamous grazing ground of the demimonde. But just who is this saucy spinster? This cut rate caterer-- - Cut rate? TV REPORTER: --who's testimony might get Professor Passion fast fried. While some have linked herromantically to both Winnifield and the late lamentedSophie, whatever her motive, it's Hunter herself who will soon be on the grill as Winnifieldassembles his legal dream team. I thought you said you andSophie were just friends? Mrs. K? It's lies, they're just making this stuff up. Don't apologize, my dear. I know-- my cousin, she was quite the tomboy, but a very nice person. Boy could she hit a baseball! [ANGRILY] What? Ms Hunter? This is detective Brannigan. Way to go, Jack, you got him. How'd you do it? The wheel, the rack? Flinstone reruns. Huh-oh you have a cruel streak. Actually I just remindedher that lying to protect the murder would make her an accessory and liable to the death penalty if convicted. But I didn't press thepoint, I was very polite. Good manners are always aplus, my mom always said. So he's in jail? - At the moment, yes. Tomorrow's the bail hearing. OK, he's not getting out? Not likely, no. Well that's good, 'causeI've already lost 4 gigs. I was verbally abused by sixof his fans at the supermarket yesterday, and my tires were slashed. On the other hand I was invitedto a womyn's weekend retreat in Wisconsin, that's womanwith a "Y," me, Ellen, KD. Well, that's nice. I said no thank you. Are you feeling OK? Maybe you should talk toone of the psychologists? No, I'm fine, thank you. Now with Winnifield in jail I'm feeling much better. There's still the trial. I'm going to testify. I said I would, don't worry. Oh no, no. I just meant that, you know,if there was anything that I-- I mean we-- the, uh, police can do--? I'm fine, thank you detective. OK. Counselor? Your honor, counsel's motion to deny bail is truly vindictive. This is a ridiculous witch hunt brought on by the hysterical delusionsof one, alleged, eyewitness. But that fact notwithstanding,I can guarantee your honor the doctor Winnifield will not flee. Not only because he has no reason to flee, but because he would never abandon his practice or the peoplewho depend upon him. Now I urge the court to set the doctor free on his own recognizance. Ms Spiri? Your honor, flight is not the only issue here. It's obvious that the defendant has been using the media to intimidate our key witness and prevent her from testifying. We feel that this is furtherreason to deny the defendant bail at this time. Mr. Green? Oh, your honor, nothing couldbe further from the truth. The public is outraged andthey can hardly be blamed. In fact this alleged eyewitnesswould be in real trouble if Dr. Winnifield had not repeatedly urged the public to remain calm. JUDGE: Thank you Mr. Green. The court acknowledges thecharge of multiple homicide is very grave, indeed. But the court is inclinedto agree with defense, that doctor Winnifield poses no danger and is no threat to flee. Bail is set at $250,000. Good job. I told you cupcake, there'sno such thing as bad press. I thought you said everyone cancelled? They did. So I just put a little different spin on it. BOB: [ON RECORDING] She was dishing up a scallopini when poor Sophie and Toby went down for the count. Now Professor Passion issaying it's not just her yams that are fried to a crisp. Are you curious? Scared? Is this the hot pepperyour party needs to sizzle? Enter now, and you too could spend an evening with the celebritychef everybody's talking about. Gee, Bob, that so goodI almost forgot two people were murdered. All this in just three days. And 90% of them from thetoniest addresses in town. Honey, you're radicalchic for about 15 minutes. So if I were you, I'd becashing in while I could. And it just gets better. Sometimes I think I'm blessed. What? Bad Bob here boys and girls, and this just in, Professor Passion's out onbail, and I'm with you know who. That's right, the yummyhamster herself, Carly Hunter. Ready to divulge her deepestdoubts, her darkest despair. Come on Carly, honey,spill your gorgeous guts. [interposing voices] Come on. God, they replicate. Can't you just shoot them? They don't die, they mutate. Look, is there some other way in? Yeah, turn left at this corner right here. CARLY: Elliot, are you home? Uh, yeah. You remember detective Brannigan? Mhm. JACK: Hi. So did you hear? Winnifield got bail. He did? Who else knows about this? - Nobody - Good. Let's keep it that way. That looks good. You shouldn't be so rude,Elliott's been a big help. Oh, has he? CARLY: Oh my god. Never try to tell a lie,when we know it isn't true, or you'll find out the hardway how to make a caterer blue. [ringing] Yeah, it's Brannigan here. Listen I'm with Carly Hunter in her apartment. There's been a break in. I want forensics out here right away. Yeah, and tell the DA that we need to talk. Witness protection? VIOLET: It allows us to keep an eye on you between now and the trial. Oh. That's all? There will be a few, uh, adjustments. Yeah? Such as? We'll, uh, move you to anothercity and change your name. [scoffs] Oh, that's all? [laughs] ELLIOT: Just for a few months. You'll have a bodyguard. Oh, goody. A partner for double solitaire. VIOLET: It's not as bad as it sounds, Ms Hunter. My business? Think of it as a well-earned vacation. Well I can't afford a vacation, Ms Spiri. VIOLET: If you don't testify,we don't have a case. I know that. So let's try and be creative. What does that mean? I'm not moving to another city and I'm not going to change my name. I'm not giving up my business. What about the creative part? I'm getting to that. I locked myself out of here one night, couldn't get that thing open to save my-- Sorry, you were, uh, you was saying? Who else has a key besides you? No one. I mean, besides the super. Mrs. Koslinski? What about your boyfriend? Well, I don't have a boyfriend. What about, uh, what'shis name across the hall? Elliot? No, no. I mean, he doesn't have a key. Now that's a brand new lock.State of the art. I want you to log every call, in and out. Why don't you put a tap on the phone, detective? I already have. But nothing is more accuratethan personal observation. Name, time, and purpose of call. The lock? Needs an iron grate. No iron grate. This is better. Hungry? No. My breasts! What? Don't touch my breasts! Hey, I didn't go near you. Not me, silly. My chicken breasts. Special recipe. Mm. The secret is cumin-- [door creaks] --and lemon wash. Lighten up, detective. Freeze! [screams] Police! He's got a gun! [screams] He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Stop it! He is the police. Who is she? My sister. You're sure? Put the gun down. How can you tell? What is he doing here? He's a bodyguard. Detective jack Brannigan. Then why was he touching your breasts? Hey, I was not touching her breasts. It was the-- the chicken. Oh my god. What? You look terrible. Oh, sweetie. Are you all right? I'm fine. All right. Listen, listen. I want you to know that whatever went on between you and Sophie-- Nothing went on between me and Sophie! All right. OK. In any case, mom wants you toknow that she still loves you. Alma! And so do I. Where's Stanley? Who's Stanley? [ANGRILY] Don't mention his name around me. Not now not ever. - Oh, lord. Who's Stanley? A beast. Her husband. You have a husband? Jack. Sorry. If you don't mind, my sisterand I would like to talk. Go ahead. In private. I'm staying right here. What? That's the deal, remember? The creative part. Instead of witness protection you get a bodyguard around the clock. I don't think I need youractual body in this apartment. Oh, I'm sorry, that was my understanding. And that's the deal. Children, children. It's a lovely body, and I don't think we need to quarrel over it. That's him! He broke in, I saw it on the video. You're right, he-- he's the one they call the dangerous offender.Don't shoot! Oh my god. Help! [interposing voices] Stop, stop. He's the police. He's what? Detective Brannigan. I-- I'm going to replace the locks. Better you give me themoney and Felix can do it. Uh, I don't think so, if you don't mind. Carly, I just saw Winnifieldon extreme close up. He says you're suffering from isolation and abandonment syndrome. He offered to treat you. Oh, you poor dear. The only thing I'msuffering from is Winnifield. Ms Hunter, I can't protect youif anybody can just walk right in here any time they want. This isn't just anybody. These are my neighbors, they're my friends. Well, that's going to have to change. Excuse me. Everyone, I'd really appreciateit if you could just leave. [interposing voices] Hello? Is there any other kind? Hello! Everybody out, let's go! I'm sorry. Just this time, if you don't mind. Carly, if there's anything I can do-- She's fine. Thanks, Elliot. Excuse me, thank you. Goodbye. Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Where's she going to stay? The sofa. No, no, no, no. I'm staying on the sofa. No, no, no, no-- 406 is empty, she could stay there. It's right across the hall. Felix get the keys. She's my sister, she's staying here. Period. I'm staying here. That's the deal, all right? No more negotiating. Come on. [music playing] I found a number in his pocketfor the hot cake hot-line. I thought it was one ofthose fast food franchises that he was investing in. And then I get mistress Helga on the line. You know she's got one of those telephones where you can see the name ofthe person who's calling in? Mhm. Well she's a minute into her routine before she figures out I'm not Stanley. And I don't want a hot cake. He's a beast. Hey, at least it was just on the phone. What? Carly, it's the lying that hurts the most. I mean what else has he been up to? The bridge of trust has been burned. Anyway, momma wanted me to come up here and see how you were doing. Oh, I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah. It's just the way the mediatwists everything around like Winnifield's thevictim and I'm the bad guy, and nobody gives a damn about Sophie and Tobias. Listen, mom worries about you being alone. Well, tell her that I'vegot my own personal bodyguard. Should I tell her he's got the hots for you? Brannigan? [scoffs] [MOCKING] Brannigan? Oh, did you see the way hewent all gooey when you pouted?

They don't want canapes. They want me. They want the full monty. Well, that's fine. We can switch to asparagusspears wrapped in prosciutto. So you don't get burned. I have a better idea. I think I'm going to cool them off a little. No! Don't-- [women whistle and whoop] [laughing] Carly, darling, do youhave any chocolate syrup? No! No. But I do have some cognacI used for the salad. No! [screams] Jack! Get it-- put it-- get a-- [fire alarm beeping] [radio chatter] Jack, you can light my fire anytime. [laughs sarcastically] Don't say a word. How the hell am I going to write this up? There you are, dear. Thank you. Uh, I'm sorry about-- about everything. Oh, don't mention it. [laughs] Really. So-- so you're not-- you're not married? Hey, I thought I heard you two guys in here. Why is he naked? He's half-naked. And it's a long story. Yeah. I, uh, I should get going. I'm all ears Carly, I told you I wantedto see the mail first. This was in the mailbox? Yeah- I-- I don't know, Elliot brought it up. Elliot has a key to your mailbox? Yes, because I forgetsometimes, and it gets full and the mailman can't get that little door shut. Who else has a key? Mrs. K. What's wrong? Don't-- touch it. One, two, three, four,someone's knocking at the door. Five, six, seven, eight,death and Carly have a date. OFFICER: Let's go. What is going on? Ask your friend. Aw, Jack, come on. Stay inside, I'll be back later. What did he do? Nothing. OFFICER: Come on. JACK: How long have you known Winnifield? I don't know him. Elliot, please. I took courses from himlike 10,000 other people. Not quite. You were one of his research assistants. You took part in several of his studies. It paid for the courses. Right. The courses. Interpersonal dysfunction. Me and 200 other people. Look, I'm shy. OK? It's hard to meet girls if you're shy. Not if they live across the hall. A workshop on overcoming sexual anxieties? It's not what you think. I blush. I-- I get clammy palms. I mean, I used to-- Winnifield, he was a big help. Made me feel less self-consciousand realized, you know, other people were nervous too. Oh, oh. So that's why you kept in touch. It's a follow up service at the clinic. So you keep your confidence up. That's all. It's not a cult. You manage a children's bookstore. Right. Lots of, uh, limericks and rhymes, right? You think I'mthreatening Carly, right? Because I'm the geekyneighbor across the hall. Well, you want to know what I think, detective? I think you're hassling mebecause you are the one who has the hots for her. And that's why you don't like us being friends. I'm in your way. My, god. A birthday party for a nine-year-old? Honey, all they're going towant is hot dogs and cola's. Well, that just wouldn'tdo Christopher Hodges III, would it? What did they even enter contest for? Because it's free. You know what daddy would say. BOTH: [MOCKING] How do you think they got rich in the first place? I asked you to keep this door locked. We, um, released Elliot. Really? I'm surprised you didn't hang him on the spot. Elliot, I am so sorry. I don't want to talk to you. [exhales] Look. He had access to thisapartment and your mailbox. He was involved with the Winnifield clinic and, in my opinion, he hasvery strong feelings for you. Oh well, in my opinion, he's a very good friend. And there was no need foryou to bully him like that. You know, I'm trying to do the right thing here. So far it's cost me myprivacy and my reputation, and now it's costing me my friends. All because of a couple ofletters and some crank calls. Letters? Le-- those were death threats. Look, you know, if you would just go in the witness protectionwe wouldn't have to worry. No, you wouldn't have to worry. I wouldn't have a life. On the other hand, if I didn't testify I wouldn't have to worry about anything. No. No you wouldn't, which isexactly what Winnifield wants. I have not had time to do a complete security check on the Hodges house. I'm going to need another 24 hours. It's a birthday party for a nine-year-old. His birthday is today. That's where I'm going. With or without my bodyguard. [yelling] [interposing voices] What is this crap? It's a burger. Uh, Vietnamese style, sort of. It's crap, that's what it is. I want a burger and fries. Well this is the food that your parents chose, Christopher. I don't care my parents. My parents are crap. OK. [sighs] Could I borrow your gun? Hey, burgers, dogs, fries-- Don't you start. I could pick some up down the street. No, because the Hodges werevery specific about their menu. They're not even here. Ugh, let me help, OK? I'm good with kids. No! Just stay out of it. [kids yelling] Hey, hey, hey! Kids-- [interposing voices] Get off of him. We're here to have fun. Now no fighting, OK? Where are the burgers? I told you those are way better than burgers. [kids laughing] Pelt the maid! [kids laughing and yelling] Oops, sorry. I can see that you're sorry. So much for the food. - I'm hungry. - Tough. OK, I guess I'll have to eat dirt. Christopher. I have to eat something. Christopher? [screams] KID: Get her, get her! Get away from me! [kids laughing] Happy birthday. Do you know what this is? I got one of those too. At the joke store.

So are you that nice with women? Ah, even nicer. It's hard to imagine. I know Hey, I'm just an old fashioned guy. No kidding. Excuse me. This here-- Was that OK? Um, yeah. Um, felt OK. Um, Carly um-- I don't think that-- you know, we should-- What is going on here? Mr. Hodges, you're-- you're back early. Is this your idea of suitable behavior in front of young children? It's him. He was going to shoot me. You threatened my son? I exercised appropriate adult authority, he was out of control. They were getting a little restless. And she tried to make useat all this foreign junk. I told you I wanted properfood for these children. Well, see, they wanted hot dogs. And you specifically saidno hot dogs, no hamburgers, and no French fries. Don't tell me what I said. I know what I said. Hey, hey, hey. Just-- just relax. And don't-- keep your hands off of me. Smash him, dad. Look, I want you to apologizeto this boy right now. For what? I'm Warning you. Apologize! That would only be reinforcinghis delinquent behavior. No. Smash him, dad. Oh! My hand hurts. Dad? Shut up! Mm, delicious. Delicious. What's that sauce they use? It's, uh, ketchup, mustard,and mayo squished together. Oh. I'll tell you, can't beat it. Can't beat it. Do you think he meant it? What, about suing? Yeah. I'm sure he did. But I think his lawyer will talk him out of it. Given the facts, hisson's behavior, the rat-- [sighs] The fact that he more orless punched himself out. [laughs] Well that's your word against his. Hey, I've got an eye witness. No. No? [laughs] Yes I do. I'll tell you, some kidsshould be drowned at birth. That's a little harsh. You think? Yeah. I take it you don't have any? Nope. Dedicated bachelor, huh? Actually I'm divorced. Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. No, that's-- that's OK. Mm. It was a long time ago. I was too wrapped up in my job. So you-- you like being a cop? Yeah, I love it. You know? Mhm. And everything's real and everything matters. Mhm, right. It's like the whole city is your family. We're all connected,whether you like it or not. You have a-- Oh, no. OK. Did I get it? Um. [music playing] [laughs] [knocking] Come on, would you let me in? I know you're in there. - Freeze! Hey, hey you don't stand, bud. Oof! [gasps] What are you doing here? - You know him? He's my husband. Arrest him. STANLEY: Alma, baby, please,I just want to talk to you. ALMA: You broke my heart. Six years of trust and fidelity,gone, like dust in the wind. MRS KOSLINSKI: That's him, the killer! Felix, hit him! STANLEY: Don't hit me. I didn't kill anybody. I just want to talk to my wife. Does it mean to say you have to scream at the top of your lungs? Forgive me, Alma. I beg you. I'll never do it again.They didn't mean anything to me. They?I thought it was just one. You're the only one I love. Please come back to me. Get up, Stanley. You look ridiculous. Get up. If you're staying over there, is it OK if Stanley stays here with me?- No. What? She's not staying with you? He's not staying with you. He can stay with Felix. I don't want to stay with Felix. I want to stay with my wife. And who the hell are you anyway? ALMA: Carly's bodyguard. [phone ringing] [beep] Yeah? MYSTERIOUS VOICE: [ONPHONE] Begonias are blue. Blood runs red. The doctor will live, the chef will be dead. Who is it? [beep] It's a wrong number. All right, I want everyone out of here. Except for Carly. You two, sleep in my room. Don't argue! Just go. Just leave your door open. Well, you bet I will. [laughs] Goodnight. And where are you planning on sleeping? Right here, right by the door. OK. What's wrong? Nothing. It was just Stanley. Oh, I know, it was only Stanley. I know. Goodnight. I'm taking myself of this case. What? I've become emotionally involved, and it's affecting my performance. I see. And which aspect of yourperformance is it affecting? [scoffs] OK. I let her dress me up as a waiter. All right? I did a striptease at a dinner party. I nearly busted this 9-year-oldkid at his own birthday party. I-- last night-- last night I almost shot someone because I wasn't where I was supposed to be. What's your point? Point--? My point is that I am notexercising my best judgment, and it's jeopardizing her security. I see. All right, just, you know,get someone else, Violet. No. [sigh] If I take you off the case it may spook her, and then she may refuse to testify. And getting her butt in the witness stand is what this is all about, lest we forget. Just do your job, Jack. The truth is, you makepeople feel good about sex and that's why they don't want you to be guilty. Oh, I think it's theopposite that's true, Morton. Clearly people are bothered that this woman, uh-- Carly Hunter the, uh, caterer? --can make an unsubstantiatedallegation against me, and then the next thing youknow I'm on trial for murder. In fact, lately, I have had to persuade a lot of people not to act outtheir rage against Ms Hunter. Well you see the irony here? She's accusing me, and I'm protecting her. Sometimes I have to askmyself, why am I doing this? [laughs] Oh, god. Are you sure you don't want me to stay? Uh, yeah-- no, I'm fine. Thank you. I'm OK. Now, they're going to get you into that court, they're going to twist everything around until even you won'tremember what you saw. I'll remember what I saw, don't you worry. You are so stubborn. Here. I love you. Aw. Thanks for coming. You take care. Stanley, no more hot cakes,unless I'm cooking them. I promise. [laughs] All right. Bye. Bye STANLEY: See ya. Bye. Bye.

The home of Lou and Frida Tensor, I know. Somebody dies at dinner and everybody gets to figure out who done it. And we all play a part. You too? Yeah. And you, if you're going. Of course I'm going. You all right? Your eyes are all red. Oh, I'm-- [scoffs] I want you to reconsiderwitness protection. This could go on for months. [ANGRILY] No. [sighs] Why are you acting like this? You could have been killed last night. [scoffs] By Stanley? It could have been anyone. But I wasn't thinking about that, was I? Oh, well you took your eye off the ball, Jack, shame, shame, shame. That's right. That's right. [interposing voices] OK, what am I supposed to do? All right. Um, OK. We bring the soup in, andRupert the Butler-- that's you-- stands at the, uh, head of the table. Paulette, the French maid--that's me-- stands at the foot. Uh, which is which? Just stand opposite me. And then, um, you say-- you say? Uh, dinner is served. And that's what we do. We start serving. And then, when I get to Mrs. Tensor, that's when the lights go out. Then the gunshot. And then when the lightscome back on again-- um, oh, Mrs. Tensor's dead. Uh, OK. Soup. [laughing] I hate people who haveserious [inaudible] meals. It's so shallow of them. [laughing] Well, speaking of meals. [claps] Dinner is served. [WHISPERING] The other end. What? Serve from the other end. Oh, sorry. JACK: Oh, pardon me. [yelling] How did that happen? I didn't even hit the switch. [gunshot] My Japanese urn! It's priceless. MR. TENSOR: Oh, dear. Bravo. Bravo. I've never had special effects before. PARTY GUEST: I'm telling you, your wife Nobody move. Don't tell me, the Butler did it? Nobody move. What are you doing here? I told you to stay put. Stay here. - But-- I mean it, Carly, don't move. [music playing] [muffled] [gasps] You are one stubborn little bitch. Freeze. Do you think maybe we're missing something? Well what are we waiting for? Let's go. Drop the gun. Drop it! Come on everybody, they're in here. What's the problem, detective? You see? It's all part of the show. [gasps] Who's that? That's not Norman. It's Chester Winnifield. - Professor Passion! Games up, WInnifield. You've been recognized. What are you going to do? You going to kill us all? [laughs] You all right? .38? Gee. You want to bet this is the gunthat killed Tobias and Sophie? It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. Definitely the best one, yet. Winnifield had a key. Mrs. Tensor used to be one of his clients. He just let himself in. Bail hearings tomorrow morning. He won't get out this time. Do you want me to spend the night? No. I'd rather be alone, thanks. OK. Come on, Jack, be happy. Carly's safe, Winnifield's going down and, uh, you might even end up with a book deal. I had six agents call me today. Ain't life grand? Oh, come on, Jack. The people wished to expresstheir gratitude by taking you out for a steak and a beer. [laughs] I bow to the wishes of the people. [car engine revs] [sighs] [phone ringing] [gasps] [phone ringing] Hello? Hello? Who the hell is this? [scoffs] [dialing] Hey Jack, it's Carly. Uh, could you give me acall, when you get a chance? Thanks. [knocking] [gasps] [knocking continues] [relieved sigh] Elliot. Hi. I saw on the news about Winnifield. They-- they got him lockedup, you know, that's great. I thought you might, uh, giveme a cup of tea, you know, if, uh, that cop's off the case now. [laughs] Yeah, he's off The case. I would love to give you a cup of tea. Come on in. I'm sorry, about Jack. - Who? Detective Brannigan. I'm really sorry about the way he treated you. Oh. I-- It's Jack, is it? Well, we did spend a lot of time together. But he's off the case now? Well he's off my case, thank god. Well that's good. Things can get back to normal around here. I was thinking maybe we could go out. - Now? - No. Sometime. I mean, a date. First thing I have to do is get my business back on the rails. We could drive up the cost. Maybe buy some lobsters and you could cook them. I have to go to the bankfirst thing in the morning and beg them for mercy. You want to do that? What? Go to the bank? No, drive up the coast like I said. Just the two of us. Elliot, I am real tired. So let's talk about this tomorrow. OK? You're not listening to me. Jack, huh? You and Jack have a good time? After everything I did for you. You didn't need him. I could of looked after you just fine. Elliot-- let-- Oh, but you wanted Jack, huh? [muffled screaming] VOICEMAIL: You have one new message. CARLY: [ON VOICEMAIL] Hey Jack. It's Carly. Uh, could you give me acall when you get a chance? Thanks. [dialing] [ringing] [beep] [music playing] [exhales audibly] Where am I? ELLIOT: You're home. In the attic. I made tea. Would you like some? I'd love some. You did all this, Elliot. ELLIOT: Yes. Do you like it? It wasn't easy getting all this stuff up here without being noticed. I bet. Well I need my hands. No you don't. No, I tried it. Why are you doing this, Elliot? I love you. You never noticed. You're right. I-- I didn't notice. You just took me for granted, Carly. And-- until Sophie got shot, and-- and then you were so scared you practically jumped into my arms. So I made the tape. I wrote those notes. I'm sorry. But it worked. Until that stupid cop came along. Jack? This is because of Jack? Come on, Carly. Don't tell me there was nothinggoing on between you two. Jack? I-- I was afraid, Elliot. And besides, he's gone now. Yes. He is. Carly? Carly? JACK: Roses are red, violets are blue. Elliot and Carly in a room built for two. - You're so creative. - Thank you. I've always liked that about you. You know I've always liked you, right? Well if you like me so much how come you never said anything? Well you're not the onlyone who's shy, you know? I mean didn't you ever wonderwhy I don't have a boyfriend? I guess you're so wrappedup in yourself you never thought about me, did you? I guess not. No. [knocking] Elliot? I'm sorry. If we're going to have a normal life together, then you're going to haveto learn how to trust me. A little. [scoffs] Untie my hands. I want to trust you. And I want to trust you too. So, Elliot, untie my hands. You're not trying to con me, are you? Oh, it's you. [grunts] You OK? I'm fine. Of course she's fine. I wasn't going to hurt her, Jack. It was just a game. She wanted it this way. [ANGRILY] Shut up, Elliot. I mean it. I wasn't going to hurt her. You can't prove I was. [sobs] [knocking] Come in. It's unlocked. I see you taking my security measures to heart, your door's unlocked. Well it's, um, it's hard to hearthe doorbell when I'm cooking. How's Elliot? Not bad. Considering he's been charged with kidnapping, forcible confinement, sexualassault and a half dozen other felonies. [sighs] Poor Elliot. I feel sorry for him. And I don't know why. Because you're a kind person who always thinks the best of people. In other words, I'm a sucker? No. Maybe a bit too trusting, that's all. So what happens now? [laughs] There'll be a trial and you'll have to testify. Well how am I going to prove anything? It's his word against mine. No, you have an eyewitness. Right. Of course. Right. So I guess your job's done? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess. I guess it should, um-- keys back. Yoo-hoo! H-- what's he doing here? Why aren't you guarding Elliot? - He's in jail. - Good. After what what he put dear Carly through. Oh, to think I nurtured thatviper right under my very roof. [gasps] Any chance of a snack dear? Felix looks peckish. I should get going. Jack. Yeah? Um-- uh, the keys. [laughs] Oh! Right. Sorry. OK. He is a very handsome man. Yes he is. And you're in love with him. [laughs] A policeman. You poor dear. Look, stay there. Felix, come with me. Detective! Detective! Detective, where do you think you're going? Excuse me? How could you leave the scene of a crime? What crime? A B & E. There's been no B & E, Mrs. K. Oh, there certainly has. Felix, break down the door. See? A B & E. Write it up. You people are completelyinsane, you know that? [laughs] God, how embarrassing. That should hold for the time being. Oh, My son can fix anything. Oh, come on Felix, time to go.Work's done. Come on. You want to stay for dinner, Jack? Sure. There's enough for everyone. Get out of here, Felix. It's time to go home. Thank you, dear. Some other time. Very subtle, aren't they? I don't know. I wonder which one I'm going to kill first. Oh, now that would be homicide. I'm a cop, remember? Right. So what are you going to do? Arrest me? I might. I can't imagine what Mrs. K was thinking. I think she was thinking--try and bring us together. Well, she's pretty eccentric. I think she's perfectly sane. What's for dinner? Something that will keep. [laughs] [music playing] [laughs] I know what we need. [laughing] [laughs] What? JACK: Hey, hey! [whipped cream spraying] [laughing] JACK: [PLAYFUL] Stop it, stop it. CARLY: I'm going to get you! [both laugh] [QUIETLY] I'm going to get you. [laughs] JACK: Come here. CARLY: No, I'm not. [music playing]
