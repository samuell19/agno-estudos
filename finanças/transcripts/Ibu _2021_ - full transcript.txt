Go away! Go away! hey! that’s mine ! [scream] What happen there? I don’t know. What have she done? She asked for food, but I didn't give her, so she went crazy. Have mercy on her. Jalu buy her food. Finish the food. Mom. let’s go home. May i go home now? Mom is at the hospital for a check-up. Since Pratiwi and Damar are now in Jogja, would you two come here? I want to invite you all to have a lunch together at Dad's favorite soto stall. Sorry, Mom, I'm having an apartment project meeting, my CEO is in Jogja. I'm sorry, Mom. I also cannot accompany you I'm having a sudden meeting since the morning. I actually miss all of you. It's okay. I'm with Jalu. May you all always be healthy and live well. Thank you, Mom, for your prayer and blessing. Please pray for me too I need your blessing Stay healthy, kids. My love and pray only for you Are you ready? May I have the cellphone, please? Please lie down first. Come here. Let me help. Put your hands up . Okay. MOTHER Now, her diet must be supervised. Don't miss it again, okay? Do you mean, she cannot eat meat? What about grilled meat? No grilled food. What about chicken and fish? That's okay. That's okay? You said she cannot eat meat. I meant lamb and beef. Let's wait until she is totally fine. Don't forget to take the medicine routinely. But I feel sorry for her. Every time she takes the medicine, she is in pain. I know. It's okay. That's the effect of the medicine. All she needs is to recover soon. Are you sure she can recover? Relax. Don't think negatively. Last year, there was a patient who completely recovered from cancer. There is only one key. Spirit of life. I haven't seen you for a while. I thought you are retired. There are still two months left. Is it? Yes. I want to retire soon actually. But earlier, someone asked for help. She was about to give birth. So I came for her. Do you know? Actually, patients prefer to be helped by senior midwives, like us. The old ones? Yes. How is everything? Do you still feel the pain? Hey. Mrs. Grandma. Stop using your cellphone! As long as I have done my works, it's no problem. I have done the laundry, mopped the floor, and watered the plants. Your cheeks are so red. As if someone has beaten you. Hey. Look at my face. Is my make up natural? Think it yourself! Hey. A natural make up is now going viral. For the front side, I happen to have a... Okay, okay. Please correct it first. Yes, sir. Wait. Do you have a passport? Passport... not yet, sir. If our project in Singapore is successful, I'll take you to the presentation. Please prepare the paspor! Yes sir, soon. Good. Come on! Have a nice job! Yes, sir. Where are we going now? Today's agenda is having lunch. Why did the meeting take so long? If it's fast, it's called Instagram story. A meeting usually lasts a long time. If it gets too long, it will be boring. Danti, Mr. Sadino asks for a revision. The front part is less artsy. Hi, Grandma. Hello, my sweetie. Why haven't you changed your clothes? Are you following your mother to work? Yes. Have you eaten yet? Not yet. Bob, please continue your lunch. If you want to be a smart kid, you should eat a lot. I miss you a lot. When are you going to come here? I also miss you a lot. Mom. Hi. Why do you always bring your son to work? He will get tired. I cannot leave him alone at home. You can hire a babysitter. I want him to be always close to me. I hang up, Mom. I'll call you later. No, don't end it. No, finish your lunch first. Come on. I don't want to! Son, These two days I have been thinking about Murni. Why are you thinking about that pregnant girll? Remember what the doctor said. Here, take the medicine. Ma'am, why do you do the dishes? It is better rather than worrying about my illness. Ma'am I have nothing to do then. Son, I want to meet that pregnant girl Good evening. Good evening. Ah, you're the one coming yesterday? Yes. I want to ask about the pregnant woman whom everyone was disturbed about. Where is she now? Do you know? Do you know, honey? After that incident, she never shows up again. That's true, ma'am. She maybe is in the city park, someone saw her yesterday. Try to find her there. Right. Be careful ma'am. Thank you. Mom, are you sure? Yes. Sum! Coming! Why are you coming home so late? Help me to take care of her, okay? It's still hot. She is weird. Why did she bring a lunatic home? She must have had an unpleasant odor. Her teeth, mouth, armpits. If she is scratching her head, it must smell really bad. Sum. What? I'm observing someone who will disrupt my job. I won't let my hands touch her. I won't let them do. Let Mom do it herself. Please help me. I'm scared. Help her, don't scream! Come on, help me! Don't touch me! Men are not allowed! Hold it. Hold her. Come on. Just feed her, Mom. It's been three times, Ma'am. I'll feed you. It's okay. Did I push you? Did I? It's okay if you don't want to eat. You can eat later. Mom. If Murni is not getting better and she is emotionally unstable, just call me. Let the hospital take care of her. And one more, if she's getting better, she doesn't have to take the medicine so that her fetus won't have a problem. I hope she can get well soon. This is the medicine. Thank you. You're welcome. The banana is delicious. Sum was about to eat it but I said "Don't eat it, this is for Murni." Try it. Come on, bite it. Bite it, please. Bite the banana. Bite more. We'll buy more. Hug me tightly. More tightly. More. Hug me tightly. I am your mother and Murni is my daugther. Do you want a massage? I will do it. You are pretty. Don't take it off! Would you like to comb my hair? Yes, Mrs. Sister. May I go back to my hometown? I'm afraid. Hey, wait a minute. Calm down. You don't feel like staying there? It's not true that I don't want to stay with Mrs. Grandma. But... What happened? Say it clearly. Oh, please watch the video I sent to you. Video? Which one? The lunatic is now chatting with your mother. How can she do that while laughing out loud? What can I do? You have to come here now, tomorrow, or tonight. I am worried that Mrs. Grandma will go crazy too. Help me. Please help. A lunatic? Next time you must tell me if you'd like to come so that I can cook your favorite meals. It's okay, Mom. your lipstick is splattered Really? Yes. Let Damar do it. Just have a seat. Has it gone? Yes. Mom, why didn't you talk to us first? We can send her to the psychiatric hospital or return her to her family. Anyway, why did you bring a lunatic home? Pratiwi, who knows if Murni has a family? She is helpless on the street and pregnant and we don't help? Mom, I'm sorry. I mean, there are institutions in charge of dealing a lunatic. We can send her there. I will try to take care of her first. Jalu and Sum can help me. Don't worry. But Mom, please remember about your condition. Sum also told me that she was out of control and broke the plates. What if something bad happened to you? Sweetheart, Murni is a human. Just like us. Not a beast. Mom, she is not your responsibility. Why do you bother yourself? Please listen to me for once, Mom. Tiwi, Why did you stay silent? it doesn't work that way. The way you to talk to Mom. If you didn't like my way, why didn't you help me talk to her? Tiwi, we can talk about the lunatic later on. Now, our priority is Mom's health. We have seen that everything is fine. How could it be? A lunatic can have an episode. Aren't you worried about Mom? Damar, you are the oldest son! The head of the family! You should be able to take care of Mom! Tiwi, I've been working so hard to earn money, to take care of Mom, to pay house expenses, to pay Jalu's tuition! You are lucky to have Herman. What about me? Sister Brother I just want to say... Since Murni come to our house, Mom rarely daydreams. She has activities to do. But if she does many activities, her health will be dropped. She is not as strong as before. Well, in fact, she can calm Murni down without much movement. But I'm still worried. Tiwi... She has a medical check-up again next week but now she's busy taking care of Murni. Who will take her to the hospital? I will. Aren't you busy with college preparation? Enough. I'll do it. I'll take of her. I'll be here for a week. What do you think? Mrs. Sister, how... about... my resignation proposal? Sum... you have to stay here. Mrs. Sister... I actually feel bad about you, but... I'll increase your salary. No, that's not what I meant, but... Sum, do you want a new cellphone? Yes, I do. Maybe she is asleep. I think so. Okay then, send my goodbye to her. I will. I bought Mom's favorite grilled chicken. I already bought Okay. Damar. Damar. Tiwi. I'll be off. Take care. Send my greetings to Herman. Okay. Hi, chicken. Is it still good? Wait, wait. That's Mom's. What are you going to do with it? She gave it to me. That is Tiwi's roasted chicken, right? Yes. Want some? No, never mind. Can I have a look? No, no, no! Let's take a shower. I'll close the door, okay? The door must be closed. Okay then, I'll wait here. Yes. Don't come here! Why can't you do thi? If you help sincerely, you will get a reward. The perfume has run out. Never mind. Thank you, Sum. Yes, Ma'am. Let's sleep. Get over here. Good. I'll cover you up. It's been a while, but I still have business at home. Hmm, how about if I make the design model from home? When it's finished, I'll it to send you. How did you feel when I was not around? Boring. Ah, should the revision be done tomorrow? Yes, it should be. Mr. Sadino asked for it. But today the team cannot work for it. If so, I'm not going to Singapore. You are the head. And this is your concept, right? Okay, I'll finish the garden first. Good. I'll talk to him later. You can sleep now. Good night, Damar. Night. Not feeling well? No, Mom. Well, I think so. Don't be too strong! Mom, may I... go to Jogja for a moment? It's okay. You just need to make sure not to always work overtime. Look here, you catch a cold. Yes, Mom. Mom, give me your blessing. If my project is successful, I will be invited to Singapore. Amen. I will pray for you. I hope all of your work goes smoothly. And I also wish you get married soon so that I won't do this again. Ouch! Mom, I don't know. If I get married now... What are you worrying about? Do you know how much a teacher and a midwife earn? You see, your father and I could raise and send you all to school. Remember. You have to be always grateful and be sincere. That's true. Are you awake? Mom, actually, he has... What? Should I tell her? Tell what? How much can you pay me? Was it not enough? Yess If you have a girlfriend, introduce her to me. Not yet, Mom. If the neighbors ask, then I can tell them that you already have a girlfriend. Mom, I will have one someday. I just don't have one now. He's lying, Mom! Jalu! That's a lie! You want me to scrape your face? The food. This all? That's a lot, Mom ..to accompany the meal Mom, I just go to Jogja. When I'm finished, I'll go home soon. Jalu, please take care of Mom. I will. Sum. Take care. Take care. I will. Farewell. Mom. Yes, Dear. May I unseal the crayons and the book? Yes. It's really hard to unseal it. Have you checked the participant data? Yes, I have. It's really hard to unseal it. A second, Dear. Here, can you do it yourself? Yes. Why is the phone rejected by Damar ? Wait a minute. It is broken? Sum! Yes ma'am. Is there any other nail clippers? Woah, it's broken. Use this, Ma'am. Please find the other parts there. Alright, Ma'am. I'll look for it. Is there any other clippers? This is me. This is your mother. Jalu. I've been looking everywhere, I think all have been collected. Good, keep them then. Okay. Hide all sharp objects. Alright, Ma'am. Mom, what if Murni... No, it's okay. I'm okay. I was not careful. It's not that deep. Just a small wound. It will be healed soon. Ma'am, Murni's blood pressure is still high. Is she okay, Doc? Yes, I'll make a prescription later. A boy or girl? This is a girl. Thank God. I really respect you! You are willing to help others. She has been doing it for a long time. She likes to help the poor give birth. My friend is totally amazing. And now, she is totally insane. You two talk too much. How about your preparation? Still waiting for the visa interview and my examination results at school. Not everyone can get a scholarship like you. Don't waste this opportunity. Okay? Yes, Mom. Don't just nod. Study hard. You must be the best! If you graduate, I will come to your graduation with Damar. He will accompany me. Also Tiwi and her family? Save up first. With Murni too? Hmm? With Murni too? Don't! I will have a headache. It's been a long time since the last time we visited Prambanan. Yes, Mom. We have just visited once when I was a child, when Dad was alive. Right. When we were all still together. This. You have to drink this to make the mother and the baby healthy. Okay? Sum... Pass me the soy sauce! Put down the book. Sum, sit down. Let's have a dinner together. I cooked the kids' favourite food. How much? Just a little, Ma'am. Very delicious. Is it? Boby's favorite fried chicken, my lovely grandson. But it's been a long time since he visited me. His parents are busy. I miss Mom. Next week let's visit Mom. There will be Dad's 1000th day memorial. I see. Who else should we invite? Have we invited our in-laws? Not yet. How can we forget them. Granny! Boby, my lovely grandson! I'm surprised! Do you miss me? I do! Boby misses Granny! Tiwi. Why didn't you tell me earlier? It's okay, Mom. I didn't prepare anything to eat. It's okay, it was incidental. Uncle Jalu also misses you. Just take one, okay? Is that a new drawing book? You have so many. Mom, where is Damar? Why is he not around? He's back to Jogja. What? When did he leave? Yesterday. Why didn't he tell me? Didn't he call you? No. That brat! He said there was a sudden call. Hello. Damar. Yes? Why did you only stay for two days? You promised me a week. So you didn't take Mom for a check-up? I'm sorry. There was an urgent problem in the office. But I already asked her permission. And she said okay. Why do you never prioritize her? You could not even take her for a check-up once a year! I didn't mean to. Mom is fine after all. And Jalu is also at home. So what's the problem? When can I have your words? I didn't mean to. Tiwi. Tiwi! It's okay, Damar. Bob, Boby! Let's play with me. I have a new game. I don't want to. Here, use this color, Aunty. The game is really fun! No! What's wrong with you? Look! Just let him play. Daddy. Hmm? My drawing is beautiful. Yes, it is! You are my smart boy! Mom. Why do you bother? Drink while it's hot. It's not tasty when it gets cold. I'll do it Mom. Don't bother. Tell your husband, don't drink too much soda. My tea is much healthier. Tell him. Yes, Mom. Bobby, here. A glass of tea from Granny. Sum... Yes? What did you cook? Stir-fried egg whites to make your heart as bright as mine. Look, it's cool. Yes, it is. Enough? Let's have dinner. If you don't eat, you will get sick. I will not take you along. Where? Mommy! Yes? I want to eat a lot. Whay is that? So I can be strong to climb the temple stairs. I want to see the temple. Will you take me along? Of course. Sum. Yes. Let's have dinner. Yes, Ma'am. Together. What do you want to eat? Burnt tofu. It's braised tofu. One and one, I love my mother. Two and two, I love my father too. One and two and three, I love my family. Come on. Slow down. Wait for me. Come on. Look at this relief. Aren't they magnificent? Look at those temples. Prambanan is a worship place for Hindus. This temple was built, if I'm not mistaken in the dynasty of Shailendra. How old are you now? Seven. Seven? Do you know how old the Prambanan is? I don't know. Guess. Do you know? How about you? No idea. Nobody knows. More than one thousand and two hundred years. That's why Prambanan and Borobudur temples are.. .. popular in the world. Wow, how great the temples are. When I grow up, I want to build a temple too. But I won't build it for years. Can I? Yes, if you eat a lot. Let's play, Daddy. Okay. Why did he say yes? He has't finished his meal. How can you feed Boby so easily? I can't do that. Be patient, Dear, and give much attention. Alright, Mom. Mom, are you not tired taking care of three kids? I cannot even handle one kid. I feel like... Oh, gosh. Hey, don't you ever say that. A mother will always be there for her kids and so will you. Whom are you here for? Thanks, Mom. Just be patient. Let me join. Are you surprised ? Why are you here? I want to join you. With who ? Her.

There you go. I want to see Boby. Take me there. Not now, Mom. You can visit tomorrow. Boby has been treated by the doctor. You don't need to worry. Is he really okay? Yes. The more important thing is... I'm sorry, Mom, it's about Murni. Yesterday, Pratiwi and I... I will follow your decision. If so, Jalu and I will take Murni. Okay. Please take a rest. I'm fine, I want to come. I'm strong. If I don't come, I will only have negative thoughts. If something bad happens, please let me know immediately. Alright, Ma'am. I will also contact Damar.
