Well, at first, his letters and phone calls were adoring, but when I didn't return the affection, the letters and the calls became threatening, violent. Long before he started stalking me, he went after my best friend, Deborah Voorhees from "Friday the 13th" franchise. Deborah and I met when we were both starting out in Hollywood. You know, once you get well-known in Hollywood, the friends you knew before you made it are the only ones you really trust. To my shame, I didn't believe Deborah. I thought she was just paranoid. Fans can say creepy things. It doesn't mean they really want to hurt you. I was sure that the stalker was just an obsessed fan. No one dangerous. Karma's a bitch. Can you make sure to give them extra hay? How are you guys doing? We're doing pretty good. Grandma! Oh, hey, sweetie! How are you? Good. All right guys, have fun. Keep Grandma out of trouble. Hey, Kelsie. - Wanna go for a ride? - Yes. You have to help me get some kindling first - for tonight, okay? - Okay. I love you more than chocolate chip cookies, Grandma. I love you more than peach pie and homemade ice cream. Sounds delicious. Come on. Help me carry this in. We might've packed this one too heavy. Try. All right. Here we go. Birdie, come on. All right. I'm gonna go get the water bottle. - I'll be right back. - Okay. I'll race ya. Birdie! Birdie? Probably found a rabbit. Oh, I bet she did. She'll catch up to us, though. She will. When's Grandpa gonna be home? Not until tomorrow morning. - You wanna talk to him? - Yeah. Come on, come on. - Let's go. - What about Grandpa? Hey sweetie. Come on, we need to hurry. Stay right here with me. Do not leave my side. No, no flashlight. We don't want any lights. Come on. Come on, stay right with me. Come on, hurry. Tina! I promise you I'll be back. I don't want to. I'm scared. Get inside. Come on. Be very, very quiet. Do not come out until I come for you. Gran, no! Tina! Where are you, you son of a bitch! Where are you! Tina! I'm gonna kill you, you motherfucker! Tina! Tina. You were always my favorite. Why did you ignore me? All right, do it a couple of times. Okay, all right. Looks good, guys. All right, so just in a few moves, you can defend yourself from a much bigger attacker. My much bigger attacker, right here. You ready? All right, guys, we're gonna work on that next week. Bye. Bye, Wesley, I'll see you tomorrow? Hi, baby. Just wanted to call and tell you I'm thinking about you. Kind of a hard day for both of us. Still wake up and remember that she's not here. Expect her to call me for lunch or a drink or to brag on you. 13 years, you think I'd be over it by now. Anyway. Just wanted to call and tell you I love you and I'm thinking about you. Take care of yourself, okay? You're my best friend, Dash. Oh, sh... Babe, it's me. Chris. What were you thinking? I was thinking I need to rethink having an MMA fighter as a girlfriend. ♪ 13 ♪ Just because your father... Just because your father... Oh. Owns half of... Half of Malibu doesn't make you a princess.

Lar's live broadcast has been captured over the dark net. Can you hear me? Can you ping me, can someone locate me? I don't know where I am. Check this out, guys. Horror producer Vincente Disanti is calling for an investigation. Best known for producing the fan film "Never Hike Alone," where he played the iconic killer, Jason Voorhees. Disanti is producing a found footage slasher called "Snuffed Out." Lar was supposed to star in that film. You know, I just can't help but think that history is repeating itself here. I mean, what's to say the person behind this isn't the same person who's behind the death of Deb Voorhees? And how are we ever gonna know? Wait, has Lar Park Lincoln been brutally murdered? Or is this just a publicity stunt for her new movie? Please tell me this isn't happening. I'm so... He's here. No, no, no, no, no! Brutally murdered. It's just a publicity stunt. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean... - Jeez. - I didn't, I'm sorry! Just... Can you walk her to her room? Yeah, I got it. - Kelsie, hey. - Just leave me alone.

Just when I was bringing you some dinner, and some chocolate. Your favorite, right? Cold water? It's been three days. I'm sure you would've really enjoyed that. There's no escape. Why are you doing this? I don't wanna hurt you, Tina. I wanna take care of you. I'm not Tina. You shouldn't post your worst fears for the world to see. Welcome to your hell. Please come back. I've been really naughty. But I've learned my lesson. Let me out for a little bit, please? When I was a kid, my dad used to lock me in the basement when I was bad. The only thing I had to keep me company was a stack of VHS tapes. "Friday the 13th" and "Halloween," the entire sagas. You all became my family. You're all I had. So I wrote, and I wrote. But you never wrote back! I would have written. If I had gotten your letters. You sound so nice. I didn't get any of the letters. If I got the letters, I would have written. I'm so sorry that everybody hurt you. You just let me out a minute, just for a minute. Just hold my hand. Sir. You're weak! Pathetic. No one will ever find you but the rats that will feast on your corpse. Ah. Hey, Judie. Oh my God. Been way too long. You had a stalker, right? Yeah. Why is, somebody bothering you? Yeah, it started out as normal kinda creepy stuff, like "You're my best friend," or "Wouldn't it be cool if you died in real life like you did in 'Friday the 13th'?" But then, he's sending photos now. Hard copies started showing up in my mailbox, in a menu at a restaurant, in my gym bag, my home. Even at my mother's home. Sausalito murders. I've covered higher profile murder cases in my day, The OJ Simpson trial. But this one still haunts me. Dale. Is it true that you were in "Friday the 13th?" Yes. A blue bikini. That is so cool. All right, guys, your assignment for the weekend. I want you to go out and produce a news story about something exciting you do over the weekend. All right, got it? Not sure I can film that. Grow up, jerk. Please. Hmm. What is this? What the fuck? What? What the... Okay, okay. Answer. Come on. James. Someone's out there, John. John! Basement. Go. Oh my God. University of Los Angeles. Room 131. Building nine. There's a man. He's trying to get into my classroom. Oh fuck, he's here now.. Help, please hurry. Hello, Debbie. I'm one of your biggest fans. Get out of here, now! Oh God. Bitch! So, are you gonna leave me in suspense? Did you get it? Well, the director went on and on about how big a fan he is, had me sign a couple things, and then turned me down. What? Seriously? Kane, his fucking loss. He said he couldn't see the legendary Kane Hodder in a role like this. Run into this all the time. Everybody thinks I'm just a silent killer. I'm sick of it. I believe in you. Kane, who cares if some fucking asshole producer does? Look, Kane. This has always been your dream. Let's green-light this ourselves. We'll produce the play. I'll be your Stella, you'll be my Stanley. Maybe you're right. So is that crazy stalker still bothering you? Kane, I'm worried. A lot of actresses are worried. I've seen a lot of fanboys in my day. There's just something about this one. - Jen? - Kane? It's happening again. Okay, have you called the police? I've called them before, it doesn't do any good. They come, they take a report, they leave. Have they traced the phone number at least? They've tried. He uses burner phones. I block one number, by the next day, he has another. Please tell me you're almost here. Do you trust me? Of course. I'm close by. Go up to your room, turn off your light - like you're going to bed. - Why? Just do it. I'm on my way. Be there soon. Kane! The one thing the franchise taught me is that death is an art. I take great pride designing each and every one of my kills for my loves. Jen. You used to take my breath away. Now I'm gonna take yours. Jen! Jen, Jen, Jen, Jen! Nearly lost you. Kane! Kane! Don't you dare die on me! You don't have to yell, I'm right in front of you. You can't die. You're Kane Hodder. You're Kane Hodder. I'm Kane Hodder, yep. Flesh and blood, I bleed like everyone else. No. That Kane on the screen, yeah, he can never die. But that's not reality. I'm a husband to a beautiful woman, And father to two amazing sons. I was there when my dad was at the end of his life, and I never said, "I love you." Please, tell my wife and sons that I love them. No stunt coordinator. Hang in there, buddy. EMT is on the way. Hey, come on, sleepyhead. Dear God, what time did you get up? Six. I love you for not waking me up then. Love you too. I can do this. Hey Ronnie, you know where my gold earrings are? Yeah, I saw you put them in the jewelry box - last night. - Yeah, but they're not there. Well, that's weird. You must've dropped them. No, not on the floor. I guess we're both losing our minds. Dee. Get it together, Dee. Hey Dee, I'm heading out to the grocery store to pick up a few things. You need anything? Dee? No, nothing, sorry. You okay? Yeah, just an upset stomach. I won't be long, honey. Call me if you need anything. Come on. Past time to leave. Little short, don't you think? Hey Dee, it's Judie. So the producer of "Snuffed Out," that thing that I showed you guys the other day, Vincente Disanti, he wants you to star in it. Yeah, he's a little bit of an ass, but he's a really good producer, and I'm in it, so. So expect a call and would love to work with the great Dee Wallace, finally. All right, let me know how it goes. Bye. Bit of an ass, huh? She'll be expecting your call. Well, thank you. - Kelsie. - Mm-hmm. Hey, Kelsie. You know, I don't know if you know this, but first of all, great work out there today. - Amazing stuff. - Thank you! But also, I don't know if you know, but I actually collect all of your cage fights. - I've got all of them. - That's nice. Yeah. Why are you putting the robe on, though? Gotta keep wardrobe clean. You know this, Mike. Yeah, I know, but then you ruin the view for the rest of us. 'Cause, well... Great scene, Kels. Kelsie, are you doing the shower scene later? Uh-huh. That's good. 'Cause I'm really looking forward to the nude scene. Aren't we all. Aren't we all. Yeah, I think everybody here is. Chris! - Hey baby. - Ah, lips, lips, lips! Cute. So, you're the lucky guy, huh? You get to... Out my index finger in the okay sign? With her. - With her. - All the time. All the time. You're a lucky guy. - Where'd you get that? - What? I've never seen that before. Jesus Christ, who the fuck is that guy? Mike Merryman. Put like a hundred grand into the film so now he gets to be a pain in the ass. Grabs my ass one more time, there's about to be an accident with the curling iron. He grabbed my ass yesterday. What? He can grab my ass any time. Honey, that's just Mike being Mike. You put that much money into a movie, you have carte blanche to handle all the goods. Can't do anything about it. Nor would I want to. - I can do something about it. - Chris. I like my job. What are you doing here? 100K, that's not even that much money. This is like a $2.5 million film. It's enough they let him hang on set and be as creepy as he wants to be. Kelsie, we have one more scene and you are released for the day. Part your lips a little bit? As per your agent, you have the next three days off. Second AD will send you a call sheet Wednesday night - with- - Part your lips a little bit? - Uh-huh. - Grabbed my ass yesterday. You put that much money... I'm looking forward to the nude scene. Kelsie. You with me? Yeah. Great. Okay people, back in five, back in five. - Yeah, I'm gonna grab food. - Okay. Kels. Some producer guy wants to meet you. - Oh, hey, Kelsie Voorhees? - Hi. Vincente Disanti, I'm the producer on "Snuffed Out." We're currently casting for the film, and I- - "Snuffed Out?" - Yeah. You're the creep exploiting the death of Lar Park Lincoln, and my grandmother. You're advertising everywhere. The same man who killed Deborah Voorhees also killed Lar? Really? That's tasteless. What happened to your grandmother was unfortunate. Unfortunate? Kelsie, I understand- - Were you in the woods that night? Did you watch your grandmother die? You don't understand shit. Kelsie, we're ready for you. All right, let's be honest. You only got cast in this role because you're a cute little cage fighter with the last name of a famous slasher movie villain. We're both opportunists, so come on, what do you say? Fuck you. All right, let's do this. All right. Quiet on the set. - Sound? Camera? - Audio speeds. Rolling Scene 44, Victor, take one, mark. Action. Somebody help me, please! Babe, it's not your fault. I didn't double, triple check it. Kels, it's not your job. A woman is dead! And she died in my hands. Do you think it matters whose fucking job it was?! Dammit! I didn't fucking check the knife. Babe. Just stay home tonight. I don't want you driving in this state and I can't make the plane either. I haven't slept in 24 hours. I'm exhausted. I just need her, Chris. I know, I know. I'll drive you anywhere you want to go in the morning. - Birdie. - What's wrong? If anything happens to me... Nothing's gonna happen to you. Deborah. You cannot live your life in fear. I feel it in my gut. This fanboy is dangerous. Sweetheart. Who's gonna be my grandma now? I will be your grandma, sweetheart. I will be your grandma forever. Hey. God, honey, please don't do that. Sorry, babe. You need to eat. Not hungry. You know grieving won't bring her back. Every anniversary of her death, it's the same thing. When's this gonna finally end? I don't know, honey, maybe when my friend isn't dead anymore. You gotta stop blaming yourself. You couldn't have known. Okay look, we've been over this a million times. I should have believed her and I should have done something. You make such a beautiful murdered woman. Who likes looking at photos of naked dead women? Horror fans. Beautiful. That's a wrap, guys. There's my girls! Hi, sweetheart. I wanna pet him, I wanna pet him! Okay, okay. Everybody's gonna get a chance with the doggy. Hey, thanks. The kids always cheer her up. Love you, Mom. Have a good day, Abby. Bye guys. We'll pick them up Monday morning, okay? - Okay. - Hey. Let me take that for you. What do you got in here, rocks? There we go. - Hold up. - Okay. Is it refrigerator-ready, Grandma? Oh! I don't know, let's go see. Come on, walk this way. Love it. Thank you. Oh. Janey. Yeah. How are you? Can we look at the stars, Grandma? Well, hey, I hope you have good news. Grandma, can we set up the telescope? Stars, stars, let's go, Grandma! I already set it up. Come on, you guys. We're gonna look at Pluto. They won't even read it? - What are you seeing? - Stars! That's called the Milky Way. It's like a billion stars. No, I understand. Okay, thank you, thanks for letting me know. Don't worry, Cynthia. I'll put you back in the spotlight. What's the matter? There's somebody out there. I saw him. Don't you look at me like that. I saw him. Is it the bad guy, Grandma? Oh, no, it's not. There's no bad guy. I'm not crazy. Grandma, are you okay? Yes, sweetie. Hey, no, one's there. It's just a shadow. Come on, it's time to go to bed. I've got a great story for you guys. If this doesn't stop, our son isn't gonna let us see our grandkids anymore. Is that what you want? Nope. Dee. Anybody can locate me. Please tell my son... That I love him so much. Locate me. I don't know where I am. Please, please. No! Now we have some really sad news to report. "Friday the 13th" actress Tiffany Helm was found stabbed to death late last night outside of her Hollywood Hills home. She was stabbed nine times in the neck and abdomen, and some reports are even saying her head was completely severed. Police haven't made any arrests yet, but they are saying, it looks like she was the victim of a stalker in which she was referred to as her character's name, Violet. Yeah, pretty creepy. Now of course, thoughts and prayers go out to Tiffany's family. And you know guys, we all love the films, the kills, the blood, the gore, but when it's happening in real life, it can be pretty scary. So stay safe out there and let's hope that they can catch whoever is responsible for this very soon. Hey, babe. You need to wake up. Chris. Chris! Come on. Seriously? Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. What is your emergency? Hi, I need to report a possible murder. What is your address? No, it's my friend, Dee Wallace. I'm afraid something's gonna happen to her. Kelsie Voorhees? Is there an immediate threat at Ms. Wallace's house? Well, no, not that I know of, but some really weird things are happening and- - Okay, if there is an immediate threat, call back, we will send a unit out there. Otherwise, you're welcome to call the non-emergency number. I'm sure Detective Evans will be happy to hear from you again. Shit. Grandma, I had a bad dream. Uh-oh. Come on. Dreams aren't real, you know. It feels real. Hey, you know where I got this doll? This was my mommy's doll. And she gave it to me when I was about your age. She's really pretty. Isn't she? Just like you. Would you like to have her? - Mm-hmm. - Uh-huh. Okay. Can we watch a funny movie? Ah-ha. I think this was all a ruse to get to stay up later and watch a movie. Maybe! Maybe. All right, let's see what we can find. Hold on. Hey, Kelsie. It's a little late. Got the kids this weekend. Okay, hi. Lock your doors, hide the kids in the hiding place and get your gun and point it at the door. If anyone comes through, fire. Oh my gosh. What, what happened? All the electricity just went out. Okay. Someone cut the electrical lines. I am on my way. Kelsie, I saw him. Go, get your gun, now. - Okay, I'll see you soon. - Okay. Okay. - All right, sweetheart. - Grandma, what's going on? You and I are gonna go find the safe place, remember? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Shh, it's okay. - Come on, honey. - What's going on? We're gonna go down to the safe place. It's all right, everything's fine. Hold on, wait! What's going on? Somebody cut the electrical line. - Cut? - Yes. Dee, it's probably just a fuse. I want Scout. I'm gonna keep him for right now, sweetheart. Go in and be very, very quiet, right? No matter what, you don't come out. Okay. What if I need to go to the bathroom? Oh, Dee, are you crazy? Maybe. But I'm not taking any chances. Get behind me. That's it, I'm taking the kids out. No you're not. Just leave them where they are. You take 'em out of there and you're wrong, we all could get killed. You're gonna shoot me? If I have to. Just stay, get behind me. You're on your own. Ron! Ron. Ron. Ron? - It's me. - Oh. - It's me. - God, I coulda killed you. Actually you shot a bird's nest 30 feet above my head and 20 feet to the right, I'm good. What the hell are you doing? What's wrong with you? You called Scott?! I had to! Sorry, Mom, you gave Dad and I no other choice. We don't wanna leave Grandma! They were fine! Jesus Christ! We've lost our daughter, now we've lost our grandkids. You, because of you! It's not me, it's you! God dammit, Dee! - It's just me, I'm sorry. - Don't do that! - Sorry. - Oh, you know better. What is this? I don't know. Can you get it? Oh, you're kidding. Cynthia Strode? Open it. "Roses are red for a beautiful lady. You're my favorite scream queen. I first saw you when I was 12. I had a huge crush on you. Could you sign my photo? I've included $50 plus a self-addressed stamped envelope. You're the coolest. Sincerely your number one fan, Kenneth Casper." - I love real fans. - Right? Kinda creepy 'cause it came to your house. Yeah, you think? Oh, but pretty roses. You want some tea? I'm so sorry. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot to go on. There was a piece of my hair cut out in the middle of the night. I didn't cut it out. That means this fanboy, he's not just watching me. He's coming into my home. Why didn't he just kill me? If the guy is a killer, he may get off on terrorizing his victims before the kill. The way a cat toys with a mouse. There's no signs of forced entry on this floor or downstairs. You did keep your doors locked? Of course. Dee, we wish that there was more that we could do, but- - He broke into my home. We're gonna send a squad car around periodically, keep an eye on the place. In the meantime, you keep your doors locked and your gun loaded. Dee, I won't doubt you again, okay? It's fine, really. - Hey babe. - Hello. - How's it going? - Good. Missed you. What happened to your hand? Oh. Nothing, just burned on the stove while I was cooking. Hey. - You must be Chris. - Yeah. - Hi Dee. - Hi, good to meet you. Nice to meet you. You're my first crush when I was younger. Okay. Oh, shit, sorry, I didn't mean to go all fanboy on you. That's okay, honey. Everybody's grown up on me. - Want a glass of wine? - Yeah. - You? - Of course. Yeah, of course. - Dee Wallace. - What? You're such a nerd. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not a chance. Okay. So you have to understand that even though Kelsie's grandma was a girly girl, she didn't take shit from nobody. Oh, sounds familiar. Like this one time, we stopped at this dance hall, and this dude comes over and he whispers something in her ear. Swear to God, she wouldn't ever tell me what it was, but she said it was so bad it would make a sailor blush. By this time, a whole bunch of people are coming through. She maneuvered around to let them through and she took her big old stiletto heel, buries it in this guy's arm. And that's what he did. Exactly. And she just dug that heel right in until he yelped. She turned and said , oh my god, I am so sorry. Oh, it was an accident. I didn't mean to do that. Nobody, nobody in the whole place knew that she meant to do it, that it wasn't an accident. She was something. - One more. - Oh no, no, no, no, - Come on. - No more. I'm going to bed. Boo. - Oh. - Oh. Oh, sorry. I was hoping that you would sign this for me. Sure, yeah. Let me get my pen. Oh no, I got one right here. Here you go. - There you go. - Thank you. Awesome. Thank you so much, Dee. You remember to lock up. - Night. - Night. - Love you. - Love you Really? Sorry. Last time, I promise. Chris? Ronnie. Ronnie, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Help me. Help me! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Kelsie, help me! Help me! Oh! Kelsie! Help me! It's okay. What? I don't understand. I wasn't there, I swear, I wasn't there. How can that be? I wasn't there. - You killed her. - What? - No, Kelsie. - Why? She loved you. No, Kelsie, no, I would never hurt her, you know that. I'm sorry, come on. I don't understand. I wasn't there. Don't do this, you know I can't do this. You have the right to remain silent. Lori, you know I couldn't do this to Ronnie. Oh, don't do this. Please don't do this. Can and will be held against you in a court of law. No! You have the right to representation. If you cannot afford it, one will be... Whoever killed Deborah killed Ronnie. And the video on my computer. Please, I'm begging you. The right side of her face has light on it, but there's no light coming from the right side. Only from the left. Now watch this. - See it? - See what? Okay. Look again. All I see is a slight glitch. It's not a glitch. There. - That a hand? - And a part of a forearm. Someone not only superimposed Dee in the video, but they've covered up the second killer. Look. This is what Dee was wearing on Saturday. Look. Dispatch, four-one-two, we got a wild one. You gotta see this guy. Found him in the woods outside Miss Wallace's house. Kelsie, Kelsie, baby, it's me. Let them know I'm a producer on "Bloodlust III." I'm her producer. I was just trying to say hi to Kelsie and meet Dee for the first time. No big deal. He had these in his possession. Guy swears he paid a buddy 250 bucks for a pint of blood. I did! I did, I just wanted it to be authentic looking. You know, we're making a low budget horror movie here. You know, you gotta do what you gotta do. Spare no expense, but keep it within the budget. That's what I was taught. We just tested it in the onsite lab. It's human. Now we're gonna test it to see whether or not it matches Miss Wallace's husband. Thanks for bringing me a change of clothes. I'm sorry I doubted you. That's okay. I was beginning to suspect me too. Come on, let's go. We don't wanna be in here. Why, what's wrong? The house is bad. No, sweetheart. The house isn't bad. Just something bad happened in the house. Will the bad man come back? Nope, they arrested him and he's in jail. For good? For good. Do we have to stay in? No, you go play. Maybe the kids have a point. Maybe you should move. What? Maybe you should move. Not a chance. You know how many memories there are of Ronnie and you kids in this house? I'm not gonna let some psychopath run me out of my own home. Oh my gosh. You both came. I am so sorry, Dee. Ronnie. Ronnie was amazing. What can we do for you? We're here for you. We'll be in town to help, anything you need done. Where are you staying? We have rooms in the town. Oh, please stay here. I really need my friends around me. Yes, yes, yes. I'm so sorry. I hope they string the bastard up. So have the cops arrested anybody yet? Yeah, he hasn't been charged yet. He was caught outside though, with human blood and a machete, so, I'm sure. Hey. Oh guys, come on. Don't have to walk on pins and needles around me. Sorry. You know... Could I ask you guys to just gather Ron's clothes and the pictures, put 'em up in the attic for me tomorrow. I just really don't want to see anything right now. Can you do that for me? - Yeah. - Okay. Thank you for everything today. - Of course. - Love you. Sleep well. Ronnie, wake up! Ronnie? Ron. What's going on? Sorry. Tracie Savage is in town and she wants me to meet her for dinner tomorrow night. She doesn't know? I didn't think to call her. Well, you have to eat. Do you know this number? No. Weird, they're telling me to check your phone? Well, I've always got it on silent. Oh, Detective Evans. Dee, I've been trying to get ahold of you all day. Unfortunately we had to let Mike Merryman go. - We held him for as long as we could. - What? - But there wasn't any DNA- - Come on. For the blood, it was human, but it really belonged to his very alive buddy. Listen, I'm gonna send a couple of my guys over to check on your place. Let me know you got this message. Flank right, I'm gonna go left. Got it. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia. Who is this and what do you want? Off to see Tracie? Aww, she might not make the best company. We gotta go. Come on, we gotta go. - Oh, God! - You gotta get up. I'm sorry, we have to. - I can't. - Let's go. Come on. I can't, I can't, go, go. I'm not leaving you! Get help! Police, send somebody to help, someone's trying to kill us. A unit is on the way. They will be at least 15 minutes. We don't have 15 minutes. Cynthia, tell Dash to leave. I only want you. No! You leave her alone! I spared you once, remember? Not this time. Get away from her, you fucker! This is all your fault, Cynthia. You should have sent her away. No! I have been waiting my whole life to fight you, Jason. So what do you say, kid? You want a shot at the title?! Don't mind if I do. No! Dirty bastard! Get up, old man! No. They say the best and worst day in a boy's life is when he finds out that he's stronger than his father. I loved you, Jason. No. Wait. Wait. Killing you will be the greatest honor... Of my life. You just suck it up. Oh. - I love you. - I love you. Sure you don't want me to stay? Well, I need you, but you can go. Okay. All right, I love you. Oh, I love you, honey. Take care of Dee for me, okay? - Buh-bye. - Bye. Love you. Drive safe. Thank you again for staying. I swear I'm gonna be a basket case for two months. Let's go drink. I have a movie I want to show you. Okay. My directorial debut. Oh goody. It's not quite finished. In fact, I want you to play a role in it. Oh, well, I'd be honored. Yeah. Boy, this wine. It's really hitting me fast tonight. Yeah? Oopsie. Yeah, you had quite a rough week. Let me give you a little back rub. I won't argue with that. Yeah, right, who doesn't? Oh. Ow. What was that? Nothing, it's just the succinylcholine. You're gonna be totally incapacitated in about 20 seconds. And then... It should last, oh... About 12 minutes, What? What? Don't worry, you won't miss a thing. Your mind will stay hyper alert and your nerves hyper sensitive. Come on. Let's watch. Please. Come on. 10 simple questions about "Friday the 13th." You get six right, it's a D minus. Passing grade. Let you walk out of here with your life. Please. - But Tracie, if you fail- - Oh, come on. All right, we'll start with an easy one. What is the name of the location of "Friday the 13th Part V?" I don't know. I played one role in part three. I didn't even see the other movies. That's a wrong answer, because it's Pinehurst. What? No. What is the name of the cemetery that the killer is buried in in Part Six? That wasn't my answer. - Wrong. - Oh God. It's the Eternal Peace Cemetery. Please. Stop. I got one. All right. Who did the producers get to play the killer in "Friday the 13th Part II?" Steve Dash. Whoa. You didn't let me finish. Oh, come on. Before they hired Steve Dash. I don't know. - Oh, you don't? - No. Well, then that's wrong again. Oh God. That's three wrong and zero right. Whoa, you really suck at this game. - Please stop. - You know? I mean, if you continue like this, he's... Tell me, what kind of power tool was used as a weapon by the killer in "Friday the 13th Part VII." My favorite part. Tree saw. Oh. She got one. - Ha ha, wow. - That's impressive. So that's three wrong, one right? See if you can keep this up. Oh, please. Okay. In "Jason Goes to Hell," who dragged that mask all the way back to hell? Freddy Krueger? Is that a question? Is that a question? That's a guess. - I'll give it to you. - Fuck. - Again, more. - Okay. What's the name of the cruise ship the students of Crystal Lake High get on to go to Manhattan? I have no idea. - That'd be The Lazarus. - Come on. You think you're better than us, don't you? I'm just, you know, some victim from the fourth film. What is so special about you? Why do you get the long lines at the conventions? You and your precious Kelsie. Did I mention that I'm gonna kill her next? Oh God no. No, no, no. Oh my God, no. Just like the movies. Because we're friends, I'm gonna give you a choice. Drill to the brain... Ah, the dagger. Goes to the left of the stomach and across and up. Disembowel. Tracie's husband loved this. The bleed out was rather slow. Okay. This one's my favorite. It's just so long.
