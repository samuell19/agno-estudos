What happens if they don't like me? They will. Yeah but what if they don't? Anna. I've never done this before. I know, but you hardly get nervous like this meeting anyone else. People I meet don't own a manor house. And that makes them different how? Oh God, Anna. Anna, maybe they're vampires. I mean Dracula had a castle, didn't he? I didn't mean they were vampires. I promise you darling, you have nothing to worry about, okay? I mean, they're just people. So what if they have money? It's a massive one. I'm not exactly rolling in it, am I? My entire mantra is just totally different. I just wanna help people, okay? I feel like I'm betraying myself just sitting here. Well, maybe just keep the politics to yourself and you'll be fine, yeah? I guess. Just don't know how I'm supposed to feel. This is all new to me. Well, why don't you try feeling supportive? Remember why you're coming with me in the first place. I know, I know. Anna, as I said, everything's gonna be fine. You'll have a great time, you can meet everyone. It'll be great. You've got nothing to worry about, okay? We'll just rub a bit of garlic on you before we get there, you know, just in case they do try and suck all your blood. Oh my god. This is your house? Come on, it's not much. Are you sure I look okay? Darling, you look gorgeous. Hello. Wow. You're not Amanda. She got sick. I'm her daughter Lucy. Our bags are in the back. I'm sorry, I'll get it for you. No, it's only a couple of bags. I can get it. Please, I'll get it. Not quite as prompt as her mother. I've gotta go and help her. It's what she's paid for. I'll help you. No, it's fine, Miss. Thank you. You know, it's just Anna. You don't have to call me Miss. Yes, Miss. Creepy, isn't it? Father insists upon keeping it on display, don't ask me why. Local folklore or something. Been in the family for years. What is it? A picture. Some deity, Wealth or something. Comes to collect its debt if a sacrifice isn't made. It's a bit creepy, isn't it? Exactly. Don't take this the wrong way, but who are you? I'm Anna. I'm with Izzy. Izzy? Is that what she calls herself these days? Oh, there you are. I see you've met my brother. Hello, Vincent. Isobel. And this is my mother. Mother, this is Anna. Elizabeth, please. Well, this is awkward. So I'm gonna refill. Nice to have met you. Yes. Unfortunately, I have things that need attending to. But I'm sure there'll be plenty of time for us to get to know each other soon, no doubt. Is everything okay? Got really nervous, I didn't know what to say. Why? I don't know. Don't worry about a thing. Do you wanna see my room? Come on then. So, that's Mum and Dad's room over there and there's a bathroom there. Two bathrooms downstairs. Vincent has the entire third floor, don't ask. Dad's staying over there at the moment. He likes to keep the door locked. He's just bloody secretive and superstitious. It's bizarre, I know. Anyway, this is my room. Oh my god, this is your room? Yes. This is bigger than my flat. Yeah, your flat is pathetic, Anna. God, it's awful. Izzy, if your dad's home ill, why have you kept the door locked? Oh, God, I don't know Anna. Mum says he insists on it. I think he just really likes his privacy, to be honest. Plus he's got a bell if he needs anything. A bell? Yup, a bell, Anna. Have you ever seen them? Incredible invention, about this big. You ring it, it goes ding-a-ling! Come on, don't you think the door should be easier to get into? What if something went wrong, you can't get in there? They would never accept that at the hospital. Jesus, Anna, you're not at work now, are you? You're just trying to find things to worry about. Do you hate me? Why would I hate you? Well, isn't that what you common folk are supposed to do? Despise us wealthy people. Aren't we all tax-dodging, Etonion privileged vampires? Hmm? Baby, please don't worry about anything. It's all fine, okay? And everyone really likes you. Are you sure? Yes I'm sure. Anyway they wanted me to come in on Monday which I was going to do until I heard the news about Father. Turns out all they wanted was investment. That's all these people want these days is money. And what they don't realize is I've got it 'cause I don't just give it to every Tom, Dick and Harry. Be careful with that knife, Vincent. You'll have someone's eye out! Anyway you want to be careful to who you hand your money over to these days. Not that you'd know anything about that. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, nothing. Remind me, how well did the fashion line go? Well, at least anything with my name on it actually comes from me. Oh, what a seal of approval. Tell us all, Vincent. How much money did you make last year exactly? How much money did you spend last year? That's enough, we have company. Don't be rude. Don't mind me. No, dear. We don't argue at the dinner table. You should see my family. Oh. They took issue with her lifestyle. Let's just say. I'm sorry to hear that. Isobel says you're training to be a nurse. And why would you want to do that? Oh. She works really hard, actually, Vincent. I didn't say she doesn't. I just don't understand why you go through all of that training for such a small pay packet. It's not about the money, I just want to help people. Helping people is overrated. As if you'd know anything about that. Well actually, I dated a nurse once. Rebecca. No, Rachel. You know we all need help sometimes. It's important that there are people out there that... Ha ha, Vincent! Hilarious! Look, people should work for what they get. Too many people out there just want something for nothing. Call it what you will, the welfare state, the NHS. It's all the same. Just something for nothing. What people don't realize is that that money comes from people like us. Take Father, for example. He worked hard to set the business up. The Redfernes have worked hard to keep it going, and he will continue to work for the business. One day Izzy and I will work hard for it too. It's not just put in our laps. And what about circumstance? Circumstance is just something people say. I guess that's one way of looking at it. Look, if you want to help people, that's very admirable. Honestly, I admire that, but no one helped anyone without the power to do so. And no one had the power to do so without stepping on someone else. It's the way of the world, you can't stop it. Look. You want to make an omelet, you gotta break an egg. You wanna feed that on to a thousand people, well you're gonna have a lot of pissed off chickens. Oh do, shut up. Finally you decided to serve, I see? I'm sorry, Miss Redferne. I was trying to be as quick as I could. Maybe next time you should start a little earlier. What happened to the chef? We had to let him go, I'm afraid. An expense we could no longer afford. Oh, god, really? We do what we can. What are we having? 'Cause I'm not eating fish, I don't do fish. Looks to me like Mushrooms, really? Just eat your dinner, Vincent. It's not poison. Preferred something with a lemony tinge. After dinner, you can suck on a lemon. Eat! It looks lovely, Lucy, thank you. Are you going to hover over me all night?! I'm sorry, Miss Redferne. For goodness sake! You know, you really should try being a bit nicer. Mothers do know best. I just didn't want mushrooms. Oh. Oh try not to worry too much. You'll be able to go home soon, won't you? Anna. I'm sorry to ask, but, might I have your assistance? Yeah, sure. I think that's all of that. I need to wash it now, okay? Are you all right from here? Yes, thank you. How's that? Fine, Miss. Why do you put up with them? What, Miss? Them. You know you don't have to put up with that. It's not what you think, Miss. I'm family. Well they don't treat you like family. But I am. Your mother worked here before, didn't she? Was she family too? Sometimes we all have to make sacrifices. That Lucy's a bit weird, isn't she? It's like she's scared, that she's got a secret she can't tell anyone. Yeah, I know. Maybe she's planning on killing one of us. I didn't mean like that. Oh, Anna, you are never gonna get any reception here. It's like nonexistent. My Mum actually prefers it that way. Hey. Is this Lucy thing gonna be another one of those things you start bloody obsessing over? No, I just thought it was weird. Anna. I know you, don't I? I know exactly what you're thinking. The thing is with Lucy, she gets paid really well and she gets treated fine. It's not like anyone's abusing her or anything like that. You know what your problem is? You've got such a preconception from your own family, you don't actually know how to react when someone's nice to you. No, I don't. Yes you do. What's wrong? It's my earring. I must have lost it. It was my nan's, basically the only thing I have of hers. All right, well don't worry about it. It's in the house, isn't it? We'll easily be able to find it. Trying to find an earring in this house is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Yeah that is a good point. But don't worry about it, darling. I can always ask Lucy to keep an eye out. I'm sure she'll find it. Unless she's murdered us in our sleep. Anna, darling. Please just relax, okay? Everything's fine. Good night. Good night. Morning. Good morning, Miss. How's your hand? Fine, thank you, Miss. Can I fetch you some breakfast? No, thank you, I'm not very hungry. Where's everyone gone? They went for a walk on the grounds. They should be back soon, Miss. Was everything okay last night? I don't suppose you've seen an earring lying around at all? It's small, looks like a pearl. And it's not, it's fake, but I think I lost mine last night at dinner. Everything okay? You need to be careful, Miss. It's only the first part. There are three... Well, it's officially winter. I knew I should have worn my coat. I'll take a runny egg, the paper, and black coffee. Finally decided to join us then? Sorry, I didn't sleep very well. Oh, don't worry about it. You didn't really miss much. To be honest, I think you had the right idea. It's bloody freezing outside. Well, she missed the pleasure of my company. That in itself is worth the biting cold. Only if you get to wear earmuffs. Oh, very quick, well done. Is everything all right? Yeah. Your dad's door was open last night. Really? Mother didn't say. Anna, what's the matter? I'm gonna be sick. Oh, god. In the bin, in the bin! Cancel the egg. Hey, here you go. Thank you. Wash it down. Maybe you're pregnant. I don't think so. And how can you be so sure? Oh, of course. Her lifestyle. Leave her alone, Vincent. I didn't say a thing. Maybe it's a bug or something. We're gonna go for another walk later if you fancy it. I mean it might help. I actually think I'm just gonna go lie down. Okay, of course. Just try and get yourself better, yeah? You know Vincent, she's just trying to fit in! You'll make this a whole lot easier if you would just go along with it. Look if that's what you want then fine. I just don't see the point. Well the point is it makes things nicer for her. We'll all get to go home soon anyway. Fine. I suppose it's the least I could do. Well thank you. Everything all right? Yes, thank you. Yeah? Oh, you're awake. How are you feeling? We're about to go for that walk. I don't think I'm up to it. Oh right, yeah. It's probably for the best. Don't want you feeling any worse. Lucy will be somewhere in the house if you need anything, okay? Thank you. All right. Mr. Redferne? Mr. Redferne? Clear the leaves from the drive, Lucy, they're making the place look untidy. I'll take a drink. Hello. Hi. I hear you've been unwell. Nothing too unpleasant I hope. No, I'm fine now, thank you. I was just feeling a bit squiffy. Squiffy? Well I hope you'll be well enough to join us for dinner this evening. Yeah I think so. Oh, wonderful. Oh, Isobel, don't forget what we discussed. Of course, Mother. She wants me to check on Father. Oh. Apparently he's been asking for me. Is everything all right? Can we talk alone in private please? Of course, yeah. Sorry, Anna. What am I supposed to be looking at? It's my earring. Yes, I can see that. It's just normally people are happy when they find something they've lost. Don't get annoyed. I found it in your Mum's room. And what were you doing in my mother's room? I heard the bell go off in your dad's room and when I knocked on the door there wasn't an answer. I was worried. You were snooping. It wasn't like that. And what was it like? Let me tell you what it sounds like to me, Anna. You snuck into my mother's room, rifled through her private belongings and now you're accusing her of having stolen your earring? I wasn't rifling. Then what were you doing? I was just worried. Worried about what? I don't know if he could have fallen, how am I supposed to know? Did you hear a fall? No. I didn't, but that's not even the point. Can you stop doing that? That, you know full well what you're doing. You always change the subject. What was your Mum doing with my earring? I don't know, Anna. Maybe she was trying to put a curse on you. Izzy! No, I'm not doing this again with you! You need to stop profiling us, Anna because that's exactly what this is. Just because we're wealthy doesn't mean we're any different. This isn't fair! What the hell is wrong with you? You're supposed to be here for support for me! Sorry. Don't be sorry, just stop! I mean what were you thinking anyway? She doesn't know you lost an earring. Probably just found it. Anyway, I have to check on Dad, so, I mean I'd love it if you came and met him. Hello, Daddy. You're looking really well. Thank you very much, princess. How are you feeling? Not good. Looking forward to getting out of this bed again. Well, there's someone I'd really like you to meet. Anna? Come here. Anna, Father. Father, Anna. Hello, Anna, pleasure to meet you. Hi, sir. I'm sorry we couldn't have met under better circumstances. How are you finding your stay so far? It's good. She has not been feeling too well herself, actually. And she's been really concerned. The lock on your door really worried her. Oh, sorry to hear that. No need for concern. The lock is just my own little quirk. I like the security of privacy. Anyway, shan't be long before I'm up and about. Not now you're here. I hope you're comfortable. Glad to have met you, Anna. You too, sir. They'd make us do all kinds of strange things at school. It's almost ritualistic. It's just the way these places are. I'm sure father could tell you. Don't state schools have the same thing? Their loss. Lucy, the glasses are empty. Sorry, Miss. And I'll have another one of these. Yes, sir. Is something bothering you? Are you still unwell? She met Father today. Oh, don't let him worry you. He has that effect on people. I used to dread bringing friends back here. Father would always have a way of making them feel uncomfortable. You should eat though. Keep your strength up. I always say, when one is unwell, one should carry on as normal. Otherwise, you just end up feeling worse. I'm fine. You should try it. It's nice, much better than yesterday's. Oh, no, I preferred yesterdays. No? You can't go wrong with beef. It's a good meat, meaty. Well, I don't really do meaty, do I? No. I'd gathered that. No gutter talk, please! He's just showing off now, as usual. You both should act your age and you're both showing off. I'm very disappointed in both of you. I thought you'd been taught better than this! Do I have to arrange for you both to have etiquette lessons? Sorry, Mother. Thank you. What's actually wrong with Mr. Redferne? Well. I'm not entirely sure. The doctor gave it a name. Ooh, nothing too severe. Muscle pain, mild headaches. Legionnaires. I believe. Yes. That's right. Legionnaires? Possibly, I could be wrong. Shall I bring in dessert? We haven't finished the mains! So, tell us more about your work. Medicine is such a fascinating topic. Actually, if you don't mind, I think I'm going to lie down. I'm still not feeling a hundred percent. Yes, yes, of course. Anna, is everything all right? Yeah, of course. You know, it might not be Legionnaires. I may have got that wrong. Hey. Looks like we're in for rain tomorrow. Did you bring a coat, yeah? Has your dad been abroad recently? Somewhere hot? Pff, possibly, yeah. I mean he does like to travel. Don't really know, why? Do you know anything about Legionella? No. It's what causes Legionnaires' disease. It's unusual. Well, lucky him then, I guess. Lucky isn't the word I'd use. Look, what's your point, Anna? They're lying to you? Is this some kind of conspiracy against you or something? If this was Legionnaires' disease, there'd be an investigation. They'd want to inspect your plumbing. This would be on the news. Would it? We'd all be drinking bottled water, it's a big deal. Well, they said they might have got it wrong, didn't they? I can find out the name of it if you like, that's fine, I'm happy to find out... This is my job, Izzy, I know this stuff. Do you, Anna, do you? Or are you just looking for another reason to hate us because we're all wealthy? - That is not what I meant! - Do you know what? I knew you and me was not going to work. I knew the second we started talking politics. That's when it hit me. I've been so stupid about us. Why is there a lock on your dad's door? I told you, the man is superstitious! Something isn't right here. You are so fucking paranoid. They're lying, - Izzy! - Shut up! I think you should be on your own tonight. Izzy? Good night, Anna. Lucy? What's the matter? Lucy. Don't blame me! I'm not the one who didn't answer! You're the one that blurted it out without thinking! What did you want me to say, huh? She was asking questions, she wanted to know. There should have been an answer in place! Yes, but Legionnaires'? Where did that even come from? I don't know, I just thought it was obscure enough. How would she know? She's a nurse! She knows! Well, what would you have done? Nothing! Oh and that would have just raised her suspicions further! At least I'm trying to cover it up. Who doesn't know what's wrong with their own father? Oh, what did you want me to say, huh? I think telling her the truth would end a lot worse, don't you? He'll already spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair! At least I'm the one trying to actually do something! Shut up, she'll hear you! Next time, just think before you start yapping, okay? She knew straight away that was bullshit. Language. We must stay composed and carry on as planned. We need to focus on the task in hand. We haven't got time to squabble. We need to focus on our paths. What's done is done. Soon this will all be over. What if she tries to leave? Well that will be my business. We'll get Lucy to keep an eye on her. Can we trust her? I believe so. Well at least that's something. We need to stay calm and carry on as planned. Anna? Going somewhere? I was just looking for signal for my phone. I told you, you won't get signal here. You okay? You look like you should have a lie down. Yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure? I think you should. I'm not tired. You look tired. Yeah okay, I probably should go and lie down. I love you, Anna. I love you too. Are you okay, Miss? Lucy. Would you like something to eat, Miss? Stop calling me Miss. I'll leave it with you. Lucy? You said something before. You said that there were three? There are three what? I'm sorry Miss, I can't. You've got to know something. Just tell me? First they offer something personal to the chosen. Offer to who? This is mad. Then they anoint. Anoint? In a ritual. And the third? Please? God sick! Oh god, sick. Oh, bloody! Mother? Mother! Vincent, don't shout. If you want something, come here! Do I have to do the whole room? Isn't this a Lucy job? Well you should have thought of that before you started blurting out idiotic, Anna? Mother, Vincent! What? She's gone. Anna's not in my room, she's gone. You had one job! For God's sake. You check the back rooms, I'll check the front. You check upstairs properly this time! Find her! She can't get out of the house, she's got to be here somewhere! Shit, shit! Found her. Stay away from me! We were worried. I said stay the fuck away from me! All right. You got me. You're not gonna get away with this you know, people are gonna come looking for me. Like who? You don't speak with your family, you haven't got any friends. Why did you think Izzy chose you? We couldn't believe our ears when she told us about you. Common girl, no one will miss her. Virgin. Oh, you're not going anywhere, you're too far in. Agh! This isn't fucking real! This isn't happening! No! Fuck no! No, please. No, please, don't. No! Izzy! No! Please, don't do this to me. No, no! No! Please! Izzy! No! What happens now, then? Not entirely sure if I'm honest. I assume your father's health will improve and the business will start doing well, but, guess we'll just have to wait and see. And how long will that be? I need to get back to London. I shouldn't think it would be long. I was thinking of going back tomorrow afternoon. So soon? Mhmm. I got business that needs attending to. What, you mean you're not even gonna stick around to see father? Well, obviously. Nothing more we can do here, is there? Sticking around here seems counterproductive. You just can't wait to get away from here, can you, Vincent? For goodness sake, Izzy. Look, I think I've done my fair share, don't you? I nearly lost my thumb. Please, you are fine. It's not like I did nothing now, is it? I didn't say that. But you implied it. Oh, now you're psychic? Enough, you two. We all had our parts to play and we all did them well. You both did very well. It's been a very stressful few days. Let's not ruin it with squabbling, please. I'm sorry. Vincent? Sorry. There now. I suggest we all finish our drinks and then turn in for the night. I know I for one could do with a well deserved rest. Agreed. I think a toast is in order. To us. - To us. - To us. Lucy? Yes, Miss? We're turning in for the night. Can you set a place please for Mr. Redferne in the morning? Yes, Miss. Good night, Lucy. Good night, Miss Redferne. You know, I slept like a baby last night. First good night's sleep I've had in a while. Really? I didn't. Couldn't stop wondering about father. My room was bloody freezing. I think perhaps you're just a cold person. Oh, how witty. Any news on our father, Lucy? Yeah, did Mother say anything? Only that she ask that I set a place for him, Miss. Well there you have it. See I told you it'll be fine. You worry too much, that's your chief fault. No I don't. You do. Always have. Well, do you know what, Vincent? I can't quite believe you're in such a mad rush to leave your family behind. I have things that need attending to. Oh really, things? - Yeah. - What sort of things is that? Important things. Yeah I'm sure - they're very important. - You wouldn't understand, bloody fashion one. Very important man, are you Vincent? Orange juice please, Lucy. Orange juice? I'm sorry, sir. Orange juice will be nice. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Miss. There they are. Father, it's so good to see you up and about. I don't want to see another bed for so long as I live. And how are you, princess? Oh, I'm fine, how are you? Never better. Father. What's this I hear about you leaving today? Oh I can't stay here. I have things that need attending to. Always ready to get back to work, eh? You are my son. So tell me what type of work are you doing at the moment? Well as it happens, I'm working on a new app. Actually I want to speak to you about that. Lucy, Mr. Redferne will take a glass of ice water with a thin slice of lemon and I'll take fresh coffee. Yes, Miss Redferne. You know, you shouldn't be such a stranger, boy. You should come home and visit more often. Well, you're always welcome in London, I suppose. Oh please, there was a reason I left London. Look, we're not so far away. Just come home and see us, hmm? Yes, Father. We're very proud of you, Vincent. You're such a hard worker. Your father's right, we miss you. I won't be a stranger, don't worry. Just see that you're not. It's been lovely having you both here this week. Thank you so much for your help. Thank you, mother. Do call. Oh I shall. Izzy. Vince. Very good, only took you four days. Oh, don't be a cunt. Come here. I'm glad you're feeling better, father. You and me both. And thank you, Vincent. I know how difficult it was for you to arrange the time to come down here. Don't worry. I'll send you an invoice. Hah, very good, very good. Let's have a look at that book, shall we? Hmm. Once you finish preparing lunch you can take the rest of the afternoon off. We shan't need you for dinner. I believe the plan is to eat out. Yes, Ma'am. Hey. Hey, sweetheart. Haven't heard from you in a little while. Hey Mum. How are you, sweetheart? I'm fine, how are you doin'? Yes, I'm fine, darling. Your sister's been taking good care of me, don't worry. Good. How are you finding things? I'm really sorry I couldn't be there. How did it go? I can't do this, Mum, I can't. You can, you can. You're strong, remember that. You're so, so strong. You're such a good girl. I'm not, Mum, I'm not. Yes you are, yes you are. Remember why you're doing this. You're there for us, for the family. Remember that, Lucy. What you're doing is incredible. You're providing for us. You're making sure we're okay. But I feel terrible. Why? You didn't do anything. You're just getting on with your job. You're not involved. Just keep your head down, sweetheart. It's not long until you come home again. Don't get involved in their stuff. You just do your job and keep your head down. You're a good girl and I love you. I love you too, Mum. You just worry about you. Yeah. Are you sure you're gonna be okay? Yes of course, don't fret over it. I just don't feel right leaving you so soon. Don't be silly, princess. Your mother is more than capable. And we have Lucy. You have done more than enough. Your tea? Oh, just pop it there. Oh, and there are some clothes in the hamper than need washing. Isobel will be leaving us this afternoon so we'll take a light lunch. Yes, Ma'am. Daddy, have you heard anything from the office yet? No, not yet, but then they know how busy we are at the moment. We haven't called them to let them know I'm on the mend. I thought I'd enjoy the time off. When do you think you'll hear? It shan't be long. But please, let's not talk about business at the table. Tell us, what are your plans once you're back in the city? To be honest, I hadn't really thought about it. I mean I'll probably end up continuing with my studies. I mean there's no point letting that go to waste, is there? Indeed.
