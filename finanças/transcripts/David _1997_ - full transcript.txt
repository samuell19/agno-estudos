[horse whinnies, men yelling] [swords clashing, horses whinny] [music playing] (David) Saul and Jonathan were swifter than eagles, fiercer than lions. In their death, they were not divided. Jonathan, you were like a brother to me. Kill me! Beloved Saul, you called me your son. [gasps] When the Philistines crushed your army, God made your crown fall into my hands. [crowd cheering] [sighing] After seven years in Hebron, My army and I approached Jerusalem. Our numbers are too great to stay here in Hebron. I have appealed to the Jebusite people. To make their city of Jerusalem our capital. They claim they can beat back our armies with nothing but the sick and the lame. What do you think? Shall we test that boast? [cheering] [gasps] Look what becomes of the well of Jerusalem. Tell your city elders that their water supply. Is now in the hands of King David of the Israelites. They've captured the well! [echoing] ...Well... Well... Well... (David) You have a choice. You can join us and live in peace and security, Or you can oppose us and die of thirst. Please. Please, sir. Enter our city in peace. [crowd cheering] (David) O my God, you have made this city a blessing for your faithful servant, David. Thank you for Jerusalem, a place where my wives and children and all my once-weak and scattered tribes can rest, and live as a united nation to serve you, o Lord. [sighs] Lord, who am I that you have brought me to this beautiful city... and this beautiful house? You know my heart, Lord. You know all the great things you have done for me that I would know your will. We are your people forever, Lord. From a humble shepherd, Lord, you have lifted me up to be king over your city and your people, as you did for that humble farmer from the tribe of Benjamin, the man named Saul. [donkey braying] [thunder rumbling] [wind howls] [thunderclap] [rumbling continues] [bird screeches] Father. The mules... they're gone. Abner, stay here. Jonathan, come with me. We'll get them back. Are we being punished, father? I don't know. I don't need to know. [thunder rumbling] We're at the border of Benjamite territory. If they're much further, they're lost. I have faith the Lord wouldn't make us come this far for nothing. [panting] Have you found our animals in the town? No, master. But there is in the city a man of God. An honorable man. What he says comes to pass. We've no gifts for a holy man. I have this silver. Bless you, Jonathan. We'll go and see him tomorrow. [people chattering, sheep bleating] [baby crying] [music playing] [mule braying] We're looking for lost mules. Perhaps you're the man who can help us. Come... Up here with me. Don't concern yourself about your mules. They've been found. Did you say our mules had been found? Mm. Perhaps you know that the tribes of Israel have decided to ask God for a king. We've all heard it. I am the Lord's prophet, Samuel. And yesterday, the Lord spoke to me and he said, “Tomorrow, at about this time, "you'll meet a man out of the tribe of Benjamin. “Anoint him to be the captain of my people, "and to save them from the Ammonites and the Philistines." The Benjamites are the... smallest tribe of Israel. My family is the least important of all the Benjamin tribe. None of that matters now, since the Lord is with you. You are the one on whom all the hopes of Israel rest. On you, and all your father's house. [music playing] With his blessing, the Lord has anointed you as prince over all Israel. Listen to the word of the Lord. Obey his commandments. Your enemies will flee, And your kingdom shall prosper. Now rise to your feet. I'm your humble servant, my lord king. Hail King Saul. God bless him. [Saul laughing] The Lord has seen you as fit to do a king's work. Trust him. Is that all? Today, after you depart from me, You should travel to Rachel's sepulcher. I know it. (Samuel) There you shall meet two men. They will show you that the mules you went to seek are found. Then you shall come to the plain of Tabor where you will meet three men going up to God at Bethel. And they will gift you with goats and bread and wine. And then you shall meet a company of devout men coming from a high place. [playing festive melody] And the spirit of God will come over you. [sighs] [pants] God has given me another heart. [chuckles] What is my first task? To gather together the tribes, strike back at the Ammonites and win a war. (Man) God save King Saul! (Men [in unison]) God save King Saul! God save King Saul! (Men [in unison]) God save King Saul! (Saul) Welcome, men! Welcome to the army of Israel! I will give orders to our forces through my son, Jonathan. And my nephew, Abner. And my lieutenant, Phineas. Our job now is to make weapons! [men cheering] We must make as many weapons as possible. We must work as hard as we possibly can. God doesn't want us to wave our hands at the enemy. [laughing] He wants us to be as strong as we can so that we can defeat our enemy! God bless Saul! (Men [in unison]) God bless Saul! And the army of Israel! [men cheering] [speaking indistinctly] [bleating] [whinnies] [gasps] [screaming] (Saul) Stop! [men clamoring] Leave her be! She's under my protection. Who are you? Not someone to answer your questions. A while ago, you slaughtered the men of this village. I warn you now. Give up hope of getting these lands, or any lands belonging to Israel! Go back to where you come from! What do we have here? A Hebrew warrior? These are the words of the Lord. [cries out] My name is Saul, king of Israel. No! [gasps] [music playing] Samuel... What now? Now you'll take your army to Gilgal. I'll join you there. You will wait for me for seven days, and then I'll come and tell you what you must do for the Lord. Over this next ridge. [men shouting] My God. [thunder rumbling] Fetch me a calf. I'll kill it as a sacrifice. Very well, Uncle. Father, be patient. Wait for Samuel. If he's not here to speak to God for me, I'll have to take care of the matter myself! [bleats] Right. Take the animal and burn it. Can't we at least share in the meat, my lord? Burn it! Bring me the ashes! Saul! What are you doing? I'm making a sacrifice! My army's been bled by deserters. The Philistines are massing in great numbers. You were not here to speak on my behalf! You were told to wait! I had to do something! You've not obeyed the commandments of the Lord God! He would have established your kingdom forever! [thunder rumbles] Samuel. Samuel, wait! Whatever the Lord asks of me, I'll do it. A few miles south of here, there is a camp of Amalekites. Since we were a nation, they are the most brutal enemies of Israel. Their leader, Agag, is a vicious murderer, a man of evil. God wants you to remove them. Jonathan! Fetch my armor! We march at once! (Man) Fix the armor! Ready the spears! And when I win this battle, will I be restored in the eyes of God? Do not even ask. Simply do as God commands. Destroy the Amalekites completely, Saul. Men, women, children, cattle, everything. [music playing] Great king, you have the field and crushed my army. Surely, the bitterness of death is past. Why is this man still alive? Why have his cattle been spared? My men are hungry. They need meat. Agag is worth more to me alive than dead. Trust me, Samuel. It's for the best. [groans] My God. Oh, my God. [wind whistles] (God) I repent that I have made Saul king. He has turned back from following me, And has not performed my commandments. (Saul) Samuel... Greetings. Stop! I'll tell you what God has said. Say on. When you were little, in your own eyes, Were you not made king of all Israel? I was. All God asked was that you obey his commands. Instead, you're as rebellious as some heathen witch. You reject the Lord. Now he'll reject you and your kingdom. Samuel, if I've sinned, it was to feed my army. All right. All right, I've sinned. But, Samuel, help me, please. Help me. Help me make this right with God. Together. Together we'll make a burnt offering. You think God cares about burnt offerings? Or does He care that his servant obey his word? You cannot bargain with the God of Israel! As your sword has made women childless, So shall your mother be childless. [gasps] No man has been given what you have been given. To have handled it so recklessly... You go too far. No, not far enough, I'm afraid. Today, you've lost the kingdom that God gave you. [gasps] I'll go find someone better to give it to. You'll not see me again until the day you die! No, Samuel. Samuel, no! Samuel, no! [sobbing] No, don't... don't... Samuel, don't go. Samuel. (God) Samuel, fill your horn with oil and set out for Bethlehem. There you will find a man named Jesse. Among his sons, there is a king. Thank you for choosing our village. To make a sacrifice. Your presence honors us. And your name might be? I'm Jesse of Bethlehem. My sons and I would be honored if you took supper with us. I'd like to meet your sons. Will they all be there? Oh, yes. They'll all be there. - My eldest is Eliab. - (Samuel) Eliab. - Then Abinadab. - Abinadab. - Shammah. - Shammah. Joel. Joel. (Jesse) Nehemiah. (Samuel) Nehemiah. (Jesse) Seriah. (Samuel) Seriah. (Jesse) And Azariah. Azariah. A fine group. A fine group. Strong, young men. You must be very proud. [sighs] Is this all? Are these all your sons? Oh, no. My youngest and smallest stays out overnight with the sheep. His name is... David. God bless you and keep you. Thank you, Jonathan. [yells] [both yell] [screams] Goliath's killed our best fighters already. You cannot go into battle alone. I have to prove to our army that I'm still worthy to lead by cutting this Philistine animal to pieces! Get my sword. Father, we cannot afford to lose you. - My lord king. - Huh? As your loyal servant, I'll fight this Philistine. [laughs] What are you gonna do, David? Harp him to death? David, your loyalty is admirable, but... David. Goliath is a warrior. He's trained. He's strong. He's a killer. You have no experience of such a fight. When I kept my father's sheep, a lion took a lamb from the flock. I went out after him. I killed it. I killed that lion. This Philistine will just be another animal that I kill in the same way. That's what you called him. The Lord will protect me. You better take my armor. [men laugh] I do not know how to use it. And what will you use to kill Goliath? Harsh language? [men laugh] I will kill him. The Lord be with you. [music playing] [grunting] [laughs] What's this? The Hebrews are sending children to face me now? Go home. I don't kill boys. And you're not a man. Come to me, boy. I'll give your flesh to the birds. And your bones to the dogs. [laughs] Hey, boy! Are you too afraid to fight? You come armed with a sword... But I come in the name of the Lord of hosts, The God of the armies of Israel. I'm going to kill you. [laughs] It's your body that the dogs will eat, And all the world will know there is a God in Israel. [screams] My God. [wailing] [thud] Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands! Sing forth the honor of His name! Through the greatness of Thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto Thee. You did it. God was with me. (Crowd) David! David! David! David! David! David! (Man) Let us see. [crowd gasps] Come out. [growls] [music playing] [crowd cheers] [music playing] [man shouts] (Man) Jonathan, how did it go? Good. Are you all right, brother? Never better, Michal. And you, David? Two more of the Philistine army sleep with their fathers tonight. Does that impress the daughter of King Saul? (Jonathan) Caught half a dozen of them, Father, and their mules. The Philistine women weep when they remember the day David entered our camp. How did David do? He got two by himself. You've heard what they're saying. Yes, Uncle. Saul has killed 1000 Philistines, David, 10,000. He doesn't discourage such talk. Perhaps he's the one. Which one, Uncle? The one Samuel went in search of. The one who would be after the Lord's own heart. Our army loves him. Perhaps such a hero wants to be my son-in-law. Marry my daughter. I could never pay such a bride's price, however much I might wish it. Father, you... Be quiet. A king knows what his people and his family are thinking. The garrison at Gilgal, It will need to be resupplied soon. Take some men, make sure those supplies never arrive. Bring me back the foreskins of 100 dead Philistines. That will be a price for a daughter's hand. You have honored me with such a command. [men shouting, swords clanging] Let God arise. Let His enemies be scattered. Let them also that hate Him flee before Him. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away. As wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. Two hundred Philistine foreskins, Instead of the 100 you requested, my lord king. The price was high. Definitely a deed of valor... worthy of a husband of a princess. I must prepare myself for your daughter. I can't greet her with this blood on me. Tomorrow night, Uncle. After the ceremonies. I know three men who have no love for David. Blessed art thou, o Lord, our God, king from eternity, who creates the fruit of the vine. She is consecrated. You are consecrated to me, according to the law of Moses and of Israel. [crowd ululating] You are in grave danger. You must leave here tonight. Tell me, what's wrong? Don't ask me how I know this... but Saul intends to take your life. [screams] Kill him! No, no! Why? Your maid. The girl is dead. Why did you deceive me... and help my enemy? I have been faithful to my husband, as I should. Where is he? I had no chance to find out. Your father wants me dead. What? Michal thinks so, and so do I. I... I don't know why. I've done him no harm. But still, he seeks my life. David, you're not in danger. Look, my father would do nothing without confiding in me. He has never kept anything from me. Jonathan, he knows the love we have for each other. And so he knows enough to keep his plans for me out of your sight. Don't be naive. David. I love you as I love my own soul. Choose any way of testing my father's intentions towards you. I will do whatever you ask. - Tomorrow is a feast day. - Yes. When he sees that my seat is empty, tell him that... I have gone on a yearly sacrifice to Bethlehem with my father and brothers. If he's at peace with that, I will return. If he's angered, we'll know he means me harm. If my father does mean to do you evil, you will know of it from my lips. I will send you away, and you will go in peace. From this day on, there's a covenant between us. As long as I live, no harm will ever come to the house of Jonathan. [people conversing indistinctly] (Man) If we are attacked, who will organize our defenses? (Man 2) It's a pity David isn't with us. (Man 3) Mm. Yeah. Where is David? He's gone to Bethlehem to make a sacrifice with his family. What is it, Father? David is unclean. He means me harm. [music playing] How can you say that, Father? The mother that bore you was foul and rebellious! You choose David's life over mine? Over your own kingdom? Why do you hate one who has loved and served you faithfully? He tasks me. He's like a pebble scratching at my heart! As I am king, I swear he must die! [music playing] In a few miles, you will come to the city of Nob. The priests there are men of virtue. I must return, help my father wrestle with his evil spirit. We've given our oath. The Lord will always be with you. I'm grateful for this. Here is the only other thing I can give you. The sword of Goliath. If you have any need of it, it is yours. You give me all these things, and I can give you nothing in return. We know you have been gallant in Saul's service, and we know the Lord is with you. Who's he? [chuckles softly] Doeg, the Edomite, one of Saul's captains. Be careful of him. Mm-hmm. (David) O God, thou art my God. Early will I seek thee. My soul thirsts for thee. My flesh thirsts for thee in a dry, thirsty land. Because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. David. [grunts] Where is he? I do not know where he is, my lord king. You've conspired with David against me. You've given him bread and a sword. You pray to God that he might rise against me. Do you deny it? Who has been as faithful to my lord king as David, that you made your son-in-law? Kill him. [weeps] Let there be no more traitors. And kill the priests of the Lord... for their hand is with David. [groans] [soldier laughs] [sword stabs, priest groans] [priest gasps] Greetings. I am Joab, One of the men loyal to David. I am seeking Nabal. Nabal! So? I am Joab. I come from David. He asks for your kindness and generosity. Our King Saul has a warrant on David's head. David... is not welcome here. [grunts] I ought to slit that pig's throat from ear to ear. (Man) Somebody's coming. (Man 2) A hand here. A hand with the horses. Come on. I am Abigail, wife of the man Nabal, who has behaved so discourteously towards you, my lord. My husband is a fool. I have brought food and blankets for your people. But your first protector is the Lord God. Please, try to take no offense. Don't be drawn into action by the evil of those who hate you. Blessed be the Lord that sent you to me today. Blessed be you for your wise words. [chuckles] There is no reason for me to shed the blood of Nabal. Thank you, my lord. That penniless outlaw, David... Dreams he can have a seat at my table. [laughs] [burps] The nerve. Saul still has a bounty on David. A message concerning David's whereabouts is still worth a nice price in silver shekels. You have no notion of who David is, do you, Nabal? [burps] What do you mean? Those who oppose David oppose God. God. Ha! David was a step away from taking your life. Mm-hmm. The ground beneath your feet is ready to give way, Nabal. Consider this. [wheezing] Abigail, wait! Abig... [choking] Michal has been given by her father to another man. You have been alone a long time. Would you come with me and be my wife? Mmmmm. You must leave this place. It seems as if... every time I've found a place to rest my head, I've had to leave. Before he died, Nabal sent word to Saul that you could be found in the hills of Engedi. You must leave. Good. I'm glad Saul knows where to find me. It's time we had a reckoning. David, wait. [thunder rumbling, sheep bleating] (Abner) Wait here, Uncle. (Saul) Here, Jonathan. Yes, Father. This way. We'll stay here the night. One blow from that spear and Saul is dead. Order me to do it. Do not do it. Who can raise his hand against the one who God anointed? The Lord will take him. His day will come to die, but not by my hand. Abner? What is it, Uncle? He was here. No, Uncle. Abner. You've not done a good job of guarding your king. Is this the voice of my son David? Where did you hear that I ever meant you harm? This day you can see with your own eyes you were given into my hands. Some said to kill you, but I did not. I will not raise my hand against my lord king. I came this close to you, Saul. Now you must know there is no evil in my heart towards you. I have not sinned against you, Even though you have hunted me and sought to take my life. The Lord will judge between you and me. Wickedness proceeds from the wicked. But my hand will not rise against you. Is this your true voice, David, my son? It is, my lord. Then I have sinned. Return to me, David. I'll do you no harm, because my soul is precious in your eyes tonight. God is with you. You will be king. But swear to me you will not cut off my sons... nor destroy the name of my house. I swear it. God bless you, David. You will do great things. (David) Be merciful to me, o God. Be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge till the storms of destruction pass by. [breathing raspily] [moans] Nathan. God makes it hard to be a king. [coughs] You must help him. Listen to what I tell you. You must tell him, “Stay close to God." Close. You know... He's God's choice. [music playing] [women wailing] Samuel worried about you, David. Even on his deathbed. He told me to warn you of Saul, not to believe his promises of peace. The evil spirit within Saul can return at any time. You will be like a lamp to the people of Israel, for the Lord is with you. That is what Samuel said. All of Israel will miss him, Nathan. It was also his wish that I go with you and be a teacher to you and help you hear the word of the Lord. His last words were, “Help David. God makes it hard to be a king." [camel growls] [men shouting, women screaming] David! David. The Amalekites kidnapped your wife, Abigail. The women went to the stream to wash, And a bunch of Amalekite raiders took them. Round up the men. We'll pursue them at once. The women are up there. Here, Leah, you take this. You harlot! [gasps] You'll be sorry you did this. We'll get no good price for the wife of David! (David) O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself. Thou judge of the earth, render a reward to the proud. Lord, how long shall the wicked triumph? [screams] [women screaming] The Philistine armies of Achish are massing in all directions. We must either abandon Gilboa or think of a strategy for breaking through their lines. How? How can I decide what to do when I cannot reach my God? God wants us to live. No. Only him who speaks to God can be certain what to do. Who would that be, Father? The prophet Samuel, of course. - He's dead! - I know he's dead. Nevertheless, I must speak to him. A witch. What? A witch could bring Samuel back from the other world. No, you can't! Can't?! Our army stands on the brink of annihilation! I must have counsel of him that speaks to God. It's a sin. So I've sinned. At least I'll have spoken to God again. [music playing] Who's there? We mean no harm. We're travelers. Travelers? [cackles quietly] Woman, I... know of your powers. [cackles] Can you bring back someone known to me from the other world? Are you mad? You know King Saul of the Israelites has forbidden such practices. I guarantee you will not be punished by this Saul. And what will you pay? Who was he and when did he die? The prophet Samuel. Six months ago. Ah... [wind howls and whistles] [chanting] [wailing] [screams] Oh, my God! What is it? You are King Saul! You tricked me! No, no. Samuel. Saul. Why have you brought me here? Why do you disturb my rest? I had to talk to you. My army is in jeopardy. God has left me. Only you can tell me what to do. If God has left you, what can I do? The Lord has taken your kingdom, and he intends it for David. No. Now... He has left you to the Philistines. No. Tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me. No! No! [wails] [music playing] We attack! [whispers] But we are so few. Remember the day we drove the Philistine raiders from the village? That was a good day. Today will be such a day. The spirit of God is with us again? The spirit of God is with us today. [people cheering, women trilling] Hold up. Hold up. Forward! [soldiers shouting] [shouting stops] Run. [screams] [yelling] [screams] Unh! Unh! [screams] [groans and pants] Jonathan. Jonathan. Kill me. Kill me. Don't let them take me. [yelling] Kill me. [yelling] [cries out] Jonathan! [gasping] Jonathan! Kill me! (David) Saul and Jonathan were swifter than eagles. They were stronger than lions. And in their death, they were not divided. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of battle. [music playing] David. You are anointed of God. You must be our king. (David) Thou shalt not be afraid of the terrors by night, nor of the arrows that flieth by day, nor of the destruction that wasteth at noonday. He shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways. [music playing] Here we are in the great city of Jerusalem, which is so rich in building stone. Here, I'm going to build the greatest temple the world has ever seen to house the Ark of the Covenant as is fit and proper. I'm afraid there's a problem with that, my lord king. What kind of a problem? The Lord God has spoken to me of this. And? What has He said? He said, "I have not dwelt in any house "since the time I brought the children of Israel "out of Egypt. "LI have walked in a tent "and have not complained or said, 'why have you not built me a house of cedar?" It is not for you, David, To name what God can demand for himself. I only want to honor Him. God knows this, and He loves you for it. He said... “Tell my servant, David, "I took you from the sheepfold "to be ruler of Israel. "LI have appointed a place for your people. "A place of their own, "where they may live and move no more. "As to a house for me, "it will come when your days are fulfilled "and you sleep with your fathers. "I will take one of your seed "and establish his kingdom... "but my mercy shall not depart away from him "as I took it from Saul to make room for you. “Your house and your kingdom shall be established forever." And... my son will build a temple for the Lord? Yes. (David) And... my son will build a temple for the Lord? (Nathan) Yes. [music playing] [wind chimes tinkling] Joseph, there's a woman living just a stone's throw from the eastern corner of this house. That's Uriah the Hittite's house, my lord king. You're referring to his wife, Bathsheba. Uriah, a fine soldier. Hasn't Joab gone to join him at Rabbah? Yes, my lord king. Have, um... Bathsheba? Bathsheba... Uh... join me after you've cleared away the meal. Welcome to my home, Bathsheba. Your husband is a brave soldier. Thank you, my lord king. Do you know the reason you're here? The sight of me... pleased you. You saw me watching you? I did not, my lord. It was a feeling. A strange feeling. I could sense someone watching me. Something you know, somehow, without knowing how. I am married, my lord. Do you love your husband? As it is a wife's duty to love her husband. You're not answering my question. Perhaps it is the way you ask it. Does he live in your heart as one unique spirit that speaks to you? I'm afraid to break our laws of marriage, my lord. And I am afraid... to refuse my king. Especially when he is as great as you. [music playing] [wind chimes tinkling] Thank you, Joseph. I am troubled, my lord. What is it, Bathsheba? My lord... I carry your child. I want you to bring back my lieutenant, Uriah, with a report on the battle at Rabbah. Yes, my lord king. The Ammonites send scouting parties that we have a hard time catching. Their knowledge of those hills is better than ours. Hmm. And, finally, Joab, does he inspire the men? He's respected, my lord king. Well, then. Thank you very much for your honesty, Uriah. You can go home now. Bathe. Spend some time with your wife. (Uriah) Lay my blanket on the ground. I will be here in the courtyard, near my men. (Man) Yes, sir. Good night, sir. Uriah. I, uh... I gave you permission to go home. The Ark lives in a tent, and my fellow soldiers sleep in the open fields. It's wrong for me to go to a house and enjoy the comforts of a wife. Uriah, you're a man after my own heart. It's my duty as a soldier, my lord king. You must stay a few more days in Jerusalem. You must come feast with me. Good night. Good night, my lord king. [David and Uriah laughing] [laughs] Have some more wine. It's good, isn't it? The finest, my lord. Oh. You should go home now. Enjoy yourself. See your wife. I'm sure it's been a long time, eh? I would, my lord, but... But I'm tired. [laughing] [continues laughing] [laughter fades] [music playing] He's here, my lord king. Uriah... You are to return to Rabbah... and give this to Joab. Uriah. My lord king? I'd like you to have this. Thank you, my lord. Thank you. [music playing] (Man) Uriah, welcome! (David) Joab, greetings from your king. The bearer of this letter is Uriah, your lieutenant. With respect to Uriah, place him in the hottest part of the battle, where he is most likely to be killed. I hate these patrols. There are scouts all around the place. Quiet, you men. [growls] [screams] Aah! My lady. I bring you the sword of a very brave man. [exhales heavily] No. The sword devours one man as well as another. There's no reason for these things. May I weep, my lord? Of course. But also remember... Uriah died as he would have wished. Gallantly. Loyal to his king and his people. That's a good death for a soldier. No way her husband dies is good for his wife, my lord. Your feeling for Uriah... makes me jealous. But you have my heart. You know that. There is one blessing. We can acknowledge our child. Oh, that is fortunate for the child. And for you? I will do as you command. Then we shall marry. And as a wedding gift, Hiram of Galilee has sent 200 heads of cattle. Well, thank him. And finally, your prophet Nathan has a legal matter for you to dispose of. My lord, I would ask that you hear this matter in private. Very well. You may leave us, Joseph. Now, Nathan, tell me about this case. There are two men in a nearby city. One rich, the other poor. The rich man has many sheep, many cattle. The poor one has nothing, except for one little ewe lamb he's raised up since birth like it was one of his own children. And yet, the rich man has taken up the poor man's one little ewe lamb to slaughter... and sell as his own. There's only one answer to this. The rich man must give the poor man one whole flock, and then he must die. What was the name of this rich man? I want to know so I can see to his punishment personally. You are that man. [music playing] What do you mean? God has given you everything. Houses, wives, soldiers and a great name among the nations. If you needed more from him, you had only to ask. Instead, you used the Ammonite sword to kill Uriah and took his wife. Now the sword will never depart from your house. And God has said, “Thou will raise up evil against you out of your own house." I have sinned. Does it mean that I must die? You shall not die, but the child born between you and the wife of Uriah shall surely die. [wind whistles] [moaning] How is my wife? Well... my king. And how is my child? [chuckles softly] Your child is thriving. You feel him kick? He wants to see his father. Unless there's any news, leave me alone. I'm... I'm going outside to fast and ask God's mercy. Have mercy upon me, o God. According to thy loving kindness. According to thy tender mercies. Wipe out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. Cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge... my transgressions. [grunts] [screaming] Create in me... a clean heart... and renew a right spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence. Do not take your holy spirit from me. [Bathsheba screams] The child? Dead, my lord king. I say it again, dear God. Create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit. You fasted and wept for your child while it was alive. But when the child dies, you eat a meal? When the child was alive, I fasted, because I said to myself, “Who can tell whether God will be gracious and let the child live?" But the child is dead. Why should I continue to fast? Can I bring him back? I can go to him, but he cannot return to me. Forgive me... for the loss of your son. It is I who must beg your forgiveness. Why? Plotted... the death of Uriah. The Lord... took our child in judgment. My child... died... on account of Uriah's innocent blood? You, the great King David, favorite of God, and God did this to you? I sinned. I pray that he will forgive me. There's nothing else I can do. I sinned too. If I had not desired you as well, none of this would have happened. And whatever judgment God makes... We'll face it together. Do you remember the day when I asked you if Uriah lived in your heart as one unique spirit that spoke to you? [sobs] I remember. There is a man that feels that way about you. He feels... that you are the one unique spirit he is destined to walk with forever. I know you are that man. Solomon. Let God arise. Let his enemies be scattered. But let the righteous be glad. Let them rejoice. A father for the fatherless is the Lord. God setteth the solitary in families. I am gathered happily with my wives, Michal, Abigail, and Bathsheba. And all of our children. Allow us, Lord, to live out our lives together in peace and harmony. What are you doing? You're up to something. Wait and see. Wait and see. It's Tamar, isn't it? Eat this. Doesn't my sister look magnificent? Yeah, she does. Tamar, what are you doing? That's servant's work. You sometimes forget you are the daughter of a king. It's woman's work. Whoever I am, I'm still a woman, aren't I? Bathsheba, what do you think? Should a princess carry out the duties of a handmaiden? It is the privilege of a princess to please herself. If she enjoys woman's work, let her enjoy it. And remember, the only food I can bless is what she serves me. Let me go, brother. That tickles. David is our father, but our mothers were different. You're joking, Amnon. I'm not. I think you should be. Touch her and the wrath of Absalom would fall on you like rain. Not to mention your father's. I've gotten around Absalom all my life. He's easy. Good move, Absalom. [baby crying] It's all right. Gah! (David) That's enough, Amnon. Don't mind losing, Absalom. We all still love you. It seems to me as though Amnon is going to be the soldier. And Absalom, the poet. How do you both feel about that? Whatever you say, Father. Can't we be like you, Father? Can't we be both? [crying] Tamar. Brother. I rode her too hard. Her leg is broken. It's better she not suffer. [music playing] Have you slept with a man, Tamar? What a strange question, brother. I'm unmarried. Of course I'm a virgin. I'm not married. I've slept with women. You're a man. It's expected of men. It is a great, great pleasure to lie in bed with a man who longs to touch you. When my husband takes me to that bed, I'll find out all about it. She's pure, Amnon. Why does it have to be her? You could have handmaidens by the dozen. I have to be with her, or I'll die. Do you really mean that? I do. Look at you. You're even starting to look ill. I'm not surprised. I feel lovesick. [laughing] What? I think I have an idea. Stay here. You're about to become quite a bit sicker. [music playing] Jonodab, what's ailing Amnon? He seems to have eaten some meat with worms in it, my lord king. He's taken to his bed. Nothing serious, I hope. He's requested a remedy. Has he? What? He's very fond of the honey cakes as Tamar prepares them. He wonders if she might come to his room and prepare some of these in her own special way. How is that with you, girl? If it will help my brother and his illness, I'd be glad to, Father. I love watching you cook. [laughs] Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. [giggling] Mmm. Now eat, brother. You'll feel better. Feed me. Let me eat from your hand. [giggling] I love you, Tamar. As a brother should. I want you. As a man wants a woman. Hmm? Ahh. Don't force me. You know it is against every law of God. Don't worry. I won't hurt you. If this was right, you could ask Father's permission. Silence. No! [groans] Get out, will you, please? Please, say a kind word to me. I can't have whores in my room after they've performed their services. Whores? I thought you said you loved me. Get out! [crying] Tamar. Brother. Help me. Please help me. Help me. What is it, sister? Amnon. Tell me. [Tamar continues weeping] [weeping echoes] Absalom, what is it? You have sinned... Against me, against your family, against God. You have no place in my army or my court. You will not be in my presence at meals or at prayers. You are, from now on, in disgrace. You take my cattle to market at Hebron, and that is all you do for this family and this nation. Tamar's soul lies in pieces, and Amnon still lives? He is my son, and your brother. He raped your daughter. We put men to death for much less. It is my decision. My decisions are law. Another example of your mercy, father? It's part of your legend. I must be able to forgive my own flesh and blood. So must you. And it's not mercy, Absalom. It's how a family, how a nation survives. Absalom. If we cannot find a way past the sins we commit, we cannot live. Now, show me that you understand my wisdom. Embrace me. [music playing] Cheer up, brother. The work isn't so rough. What have you got to be so happy about, brother? It doesn't humiliate you chasing cattle all day? Don't worry about me. I won't be doing this for much longer. You won't? I'll find my way back into the court. Father will soften his judgment against me. Do you know why? He'll forgive anyone just to win back one more person's love. Father's not satisfied with God's love. He wants everyone else to love him as well. (Absalom) You have us all figured out, Amnon. (Amnon) I know Father. That's all. And all this while my sister, Tamar eats dirt and babbles like a sick child because of you. You took her soul. I can't believe I'm hearing this rubbish. She's a woman, Absalom. Women are weak. Women are born to suffer. [drum playing strong rhythm] [people laughing, chattering indistinctly] This is good. [both laughing] (Amnon) Come on. Come here, my pretty. Let's dance. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come closer. Come closer. Oh, come on. (Amnon) It's so good. Come on. You want to play? When the wine has weakened Amnon, strike him and kill him. Come back. Come back. Come here. [urinating] [grunts] Tamar. What is it, brother? Amnon is dead. I had him killed. Report this to our father. I have killed Amnon in just judgment for what he did to you. Tell Father I know I must be lost to him for disobeying his command and doing this. Perhaps I shall never see him again. Nevertheless, I still love him. I shall love him forever. Say goodbye to him for me... and to all of Jerusalem. I will never forget what you've given up for me. [thunder rumbling] O God, you have made the earth tremble. You have broken it. Heal the breaches, for the earth shakes beneath our feet. You've cast us off. You have scattered us. Oh, please! Turn yourself to us again. I'm saddened for you, my lord king. Feeling sorry for me is turning into a full-time occupation for you, Nathan. You have given me and the nation much reason to celebrate, as well. That's God. Not me. Amen. Do you think that once God starts punishing a man, He will ever stop? Perhaps it is those who God loves the most, those on whom He lavishes His gifts, that He punishes the most severely. The price of God's glory. Remember what Samuel told me all those years ago. “Help David. God makes it hard to be a king." This is the woman in mourning from Tekoah who bids you to give her judgment. Yes. Ask her to come in. Help me, please, my lord king. What seems to be the problem? I am a widow. I had two sons. They worked the fields together. And they quarreled. And one Killed the other. Go on. All the rest of my family bid me to punish my surviving son harshly. But if I do that, I will have no heir. And my husband's name will disappear from the earth. I will have nothing. Whoever... tries to force you to take your remaining son's life shall be brought to me, and I will deal with them. No one else will bother you. Thank you, my lord king. God will respect no man unless he devises some way for those children he has lost to be brought back to Him. The man wants you to judge him, my lord king. He was burning the tents outside the city gates and trying to drain our water supply. Who on earth would do such a stupid thing? Bring him in. Well? I can only ask forgiveness and understanding in the words of a prayer my father made. May I speak my father's words? Go ahead. “Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, o my God, "and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. “Create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me." Those are my words. [music playing] He's not our child, but he is my son, precious to me. “Behold, I will raise up evil from thine house." How easily you forget the prophet's message. I know what you're thinking. You think that with Absalom permanently in disgrace, my favor would fall on Solomon. [scoffs] I am not planning the succession, David. Simply consider this. Absalom has already shed his own brother's blood. What is he capable of next? He's my son! Promises between men... or contracts between merchants or treaties between nations. All of these can be broken if advantage demands it. But the covenant between a father and a son can never end. No matter what Absalom did, I can never stop being his father. If he does something wrong, it is because I failed to teach him. He is mine, as you are mine. As I am God's. May I ask you a frank question, my lord prince? Please. If you were king... would you have judged the actions of Amnon and your own deeds as lightly as David did? David faces the law and the commands of his heart, and always finds a way to disobey the law. You... chose the law over your own blood. That tells me you are strong enough to properly lead the nation. Don't speak any more of these things, Aphitophel. These words are already written in your own heart. It is because of David's mercy that I am alive at this moment. If the roles had been reversed, you would have been strong enough to order your son's punishment. That is something you have never forgiven your father for. For that weakness he calls mercy. What if all you say is true, what then? Watch the elders of the tribes and the army. How they view your father. There's an opportunity for you if you only seize it. (Soldier 1) With the gold we lavish on David there's no money left for food. (Soldier 2) It would be one thing if we could see an end to the sacrifice. But with your father, there is no reasoning. There was a time when being a member of David's army meant respect. He even shortchanges us to pay for his temple now. The Assyrians and Moabites are taking ground from us every day. (Soldier 3) Something has to be done. (Soldier 2) Yes, but what? (Soldier 3) The men can't take it anymore. (Soldier 2) I know, but the longer we stand here and wait and do nothing the worse the situation gets. You may answer this question honestly. If Israel had a new ruler, a younger man who would rebuild the army, who would let the villagers keep more of their wealth, would you men support him? How badly do we stand with the army, then? Nearly two-thirds of all the soldiers on foot patrol in the southern part of the nation have gone over to Absalom. Half of the farmers of the villages hereabouts have gone over to him as well. And in the north? The tribes of Israel on the other side of the Jordan? Reports of their loyalty are still unconfirmed. [groans] Aphitophel has guided Absalom brilliantly. Am I correct that here in Jerusalem is where we're at our weakest and most vulnerable? Yes, my lord. If we were Philistines or Egyptians, Joab, now would be the perfect time for us to take poison. What do you think, Nathan? Do you think God loves Absalom enough to see him take my life and my crown? I do not, my lord king. God wants you to survive. You're like a lamp for his people. We will not defend Jerusalem. You will not defend Jerusalem? Absalom has a superior fighting force. I've spent 15 years, the best years of my life, building this city into the capital of the nation. I'm not gonna let all I've accomplished get burned to the ground in a few days of bloody fighting. That's one sin against God I know at least not to commit. So, what do you propose? We head for the north. Find those men who are loyal to David and Joab, if there are any. We will not sacrifice Jerusalem for these troubles. I fear for those who must stay and face the generosity of Absalom. You don't need to tell me that you warned me about him. I remember that. You've been right about almost everything, Bathsheba. From the very first moment you entered this palace. And you may very well ask, if I knew all the punishments that were gonna be heaped upon us, would I still have gone toward you? It is a question better not asked. I love you. I love you, too. I'm sorry. So sorry for your city. [music playing] (David) Keep not thy silence, o God. Hold not thy peace and be not still. Thine enemies make a tumult. They that hate thee have lifted their heads. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people. They have said, “Come, let us cut them off from their nation, that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance." Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, o Lord. Fill their faces with shame. (Man) David! David. My tribe of Gittite people wish to join you. My road is long and hard, Ittai. You and your people will be safe in Jerusalem. You've only lived here a short time. And if you remain, you will continue to have my blessing. We are your servants. But we have sworn an oath to your kingdom. And the kingdom of David is wherever David is. Thank you, Ittai. I am glad of your support. Zadok, the Ark must remain in the city. But, my lord king, it cannot fall into Absalom's hands. If I find favor with God I will return to Jerusalem and see the Ark again. If not... it will offer me no protection against Absalom. Nathan? You're right, my lord king. The Ark must remain. [music playing] Bahurim. Maybe we'll find someone who sympathizes with us up there. Let's go on ahead. (Man) Go away! Get out of here! We curse you! Why do you throw stones at us? If you hate us so much, Why don't you join Absalom in Jerusalem? I am Shimei, the Benjamite. Nephew of Abner and Jonathan. And we curse both David and his son Absalom. You have Saul's blood on your hands. You have stolen his kingdom like a thief. And if your son turns on you like a thief as well, then God is just, and you are a bloody man. Now turn away. You'll find nowhere to hide here in Bahurim. [music playing] Order me, my lord king, to take a few guards into Bahurim and pay Shimei a visit. Why should we let that dead dog curse you and live another day? Let me go over there and take off his head. No doubt he too thinks he has God's blessing. It seems as though a lot of men thrive on hating me at the moment. The Benjamites at least have some reason. Compared with Absalom, who is my own flesh and blood. Let Shimei and his men curse me and throw stones at me. God may see our afflictions and repay us with good for what we're suffering. Like Saul, you're still letting those who hate you flourish. It is a policy that is harming us to this day. I have a few ideas about fighting back. Send for that friend of Aphitophel's. Hushai, I think his name is. [music playing] Hushai, my lord king. You called for me, my lord king? You study with Nathan and Zadok? Yes, my lord king. You are known to the one who calls himself Absalom's advisor, Aphitophel? Yes. I'm going to ask you to do something you might find painful, Hushai. Ask, my lord king. I want you to return to the comfort of Jerusalem. But I want to be here, with you and Nathan. You cannot help me here. But, if you can get close to Absalom, you may defeat the counsels of Aphitophel. I see, my lord king. Go to Jerusalem. Go now. [music playing] The council of elders, my lord king. My lord king. The council of elders wants to know, will you stop collecting tribute for the temple? For the time being, all your tribute will go towards strengthening the army. My father is a cruel, old leopard. He has to be hunted down, cornered and killed. That is the first work of the nation. Nothing else can be accomplished until David is no longer a threat. Agreed, my lord king. [crowd cheering] (Woman) Absalom! Absalom! You are Ahimaz, nephew of Zadok. Priest to David. Who says so? Your king. Your true king, David, may require a service from you. Be ready. The young priest, Hushai, would like to greet the king. The king recognizes in Hushai a brilliant student of Nathan and Zadok. Are you comfortable in swearing loyalty to me? I am a great believer in youth and power. The Lord favored David when he was young, and fought a weak king. Now, Absalom is similarly favored. Well spoken. [sheep bleating] [music playing] [women laughing] On the other side of that door are three of David's concubines. Take them tonight, all of them. That way, you will fulfill the prophecy and everyone will know that what once was David's is now yours. (Bathsheba) Solomon. The news is not good? None of the villagers this close to Jerusalem want to join us. In fact, nobody in this area is prepared to meet with the regular army. Won't they give us any food? They're afraid. Absalom has troops everywhere. Our only hope are the tribes of Judea on the other side of the river. We're too weak to make a river crossing. David, if Absalom catches you with the river at your back, he will annihilate you. (Aphitophel) We should pursue David with all our forces now, tonight, while he's weary. And with little support, we can kill him without many losses. Hushai, what do you say? I think my learned friend is wrong. You know that your father and Joab and their best men are still strong soldiers. You strike at them now, they're like a wounded bear, ready to put up their angriest, bloodiest fight. If ever there was a time when David would be likely to frighten your men, it's now. My counsel... is to wait. Let all the men of Israel from Dan to Sheba join you. You will fall on him then like a hard rain. I accept Hushai's counsel. We will wait. We wouldn't want it to be said that slaughter was the purpose of Absalom's rule. [donkey braying] [men shouting indistinctly] - Can you run? - Yes. Run to David's camp just north of Bahurim. Tell him he must cross the river without delay. Tell him I do not know how much longer Absalom will heed my counsel. Can you remember all of that? Yes, I can. Then run. [music playing] [panting] Who is that? This is Ahimaz. Blood kin to Zadok and loyal to you, my lord king. Yes? My lord king, I have news from your servant, Hushai. Come in, come in. [music playing] [women laughing] [horse whinnies] We will commence the war against David in Aphitophel's honor, at sunrise. My lord king, please welcome Shobi of Rabbah, Machir of Lodebar, And Brarzilla of Rogelim. They all head militias of their villages, and they're all prepared to fight for us. We are honored to help, my lord king. You'll each take one half of the force, and I will lead. No, you can't. Why not? If you are with us, and the battle goes poorly, they will kill all of us to get to you. If you are not seen on the field, we may survive a defeat well enough to fight another day. Ittai, what do you think? I agree. Very well then, Joab. You will lead. Where will you meet them? At the wood of Ephraim, where they will be tired after crossing the river. [laughs] One last thing, Joab. If it is at all possible to save the life of Absalom, please find a way. [music playing] Forward! [crowd cheers] I used to be frightened entering a battle. Now I'm frightened not to enter it. [screaming] [swords clanging] [yelling] Yah! Absalom! Absalom! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [screams] We must follow Absalom! Aah! [groaning] Aah! [Absalom grunting] Aah! Ah! Aah! [screams] [music playing] Go. Tell the king what we have done. Follow lttai. Inform the king. [horse whinnies] A rider. No, two. First one's Ittai. A good man. He brings good tidings. I feel it. All is well, my lord king. Blessed be the Lord God, who delivered up those men who raised their hands against you. What news of Absalom, my son? Is he captive? Is he prisoner? Is he safe? Uh, I... I cannot say, my lord king. Joab and a detachment sought after him. There was furious fighting, but... I do not know the results. (David) Well? Good news, my lord king. For God has delivered you this day from the power of those who rose against you. And Absalom? May all the enemies of King David, God's anointed, meet the same fate as that young man has. [music playing] Oh, my son. My son. Absalom! Why couldn't God take my life instead of yours? [screams] Please. Leave me. My lord king, you have turned this day's victory into a ceremony of mourning. The camp speaks only of your grief for your son. David. David. We have been together a long time. And I have always loved you. And I've always tried to understand the way you feel, the way you see things. But today, you disgraced yourself... and me... and all your men. How's that? You not only love your enemies, you seem to love them more than your friends. If all your loyal followers had died, and Absalom had lived to crush your kingdom, You would have been pleased. What would you have me do? Return to Jerusalem. Stand up at the gates, and thank all those who were loyal to you this day. Honor them with your greeting. Or they will start a rebellion more dangerous than the one we put down today. Be king, David. Be king again. [music playing] [crowd cheering] Praise be to King David of the Israelites! Hail! I know this victory is hollow for you. My sorrow... is not just for myself. With both my sons gone, how can I be sure that this kingdom will survive on a firm foundation? You taught me that after every trial the nation faces, it emerges stronger than before. And you said this was proof of God's love. No matter what mistakes and ordeals we suffer, God loves us, and calls us back to him. You must go and listen to God. [music playing] (God) You have made great wars, and have shed blood in great abundance. Therefore, you shall not build My temple. Solomon, your son, shall sit upon the throne of Israel. I will give him rest from his enemies so that he can be a man of peace. And so it shall be Solomon who will build My temple. Your son shall be My son. And I will be his father. And I will establish his kingdom... Forever. [music playing] [music playing]
