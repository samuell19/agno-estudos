There is an old, oblique scar... three-quarter inches... at the mid third of the upper lip. Ooh! - The scar ends at the anterior of the hairline. There is a flattening of the prominence at the junction of the bony portion of the nasal bone and the cartilaginous septum. Extending across the upper lip to the left nostril is an odd, irregular scar seven-eighths by one-eighths that ends at the mucocutaneous border. - Uh! No goal! - Suture cross scars are present. Scar ends at the lower right lip. A vertical linear scar on the right upper lip looks to have come from youth. Come on, guys! Winter white light like a sword in the sun. Terry, keep your fingers off the screen! Warm nights under quilts; whispers back and forth; saves and misses. How'd you know he was gonna shoot it high? 'Cause it looked like he was going to shoot it-- - Terry, you got to know. The goalie's the punching bag if you lose. And hero if you win. I'd tell Mitch he was mental playing goal. - Anybody's girl would rather be with you. - Hey, wait. Wait, which girls? - Uh! - Terry! You all right? - Buffalo's getting a team next season. Buffalo. Spent a month there one night. He's in there. Red!? Game's gone now. I hardly ever watch it anymore. Cheerleaders. Kids who train in a boxing ring. What's that got to do with a puck and a net? It's his first in nine. And the game's all tied up one-one. - What was it I was going on about? Oh. You know, an athlete used to live in the moment. It's in my memories that I live. Oh. Terry Sawchuk. I remember Terry Sawchuk. Ah, how could you get a handle on a guy like him? Yeah. Sawchuk. Even his name, it means hockey to me. And, uh, when I'm picking my team in the afterlife? Hm. He'll be backstopping us for sure. Would he know that? Are we on yet? Hello, Canada! And hockey fans in the United States and Newfoundland. Sawchuk? Jeez. Why don't you ask me something a little easier? Hm? You gotta stay low, stay forward; see the shot before it leaves the stick. Come. Nah. Don't let that dog in this house! She's not having puppies in here. - But... I'm taking Mitch with me to the plant. - Louis, Bob say he has scouts coming to look at him any day now. - Yeah and this winter we'll burn the floorboards to stay alive. - Take Terry. - Boys'll crucify Terry. - Why? What do you mean? - I mean I need Mitch. - Who's going to take care of that cord of wood, huh? - Lady? Lady? Come on, girl. What's wrong? You're okay. You're just frozen. You're gonna wake up. Come on! Just frozen. Please, come on. Breathe, breathe. Come on. Come on. - Terry? - Come on. - What are you doing? - They're okay. They're just frozen. They're gonna wake up! No! - They're dead and a good thing, too. We would'a had to drown 'em. - Huh. - Now, get 'em out of here before your mother sees 'em. Think God lets dogs in heaven? If heaven doesn't have pups running around, I don't wanna go there. - In heaven, I'll be as good a goalie as you. - You think too much, Terry. All you have to do is stop the puck. Stay low and stay forward. Like last night. Jimmy Day's coming at me at full speed and lets fly a shot and it's a 100 miles an hour, definitely close to that, and I'm thinking stay low, stay forward and I see it before he lets the shot fly. And it's a bullet. It's in the glove. No rebound. You should've seen his face! He thought he had me and that'll teach him to bring his girl to a game. I feel bad for him. Who wants a soda? Ah... - Hey. Mitch? Mitch? Aw, get in the swing. - Kettleman says the body's gonna stay in storage until the ground thaws. Stop it. There's something like a question in the air that will linger from now on. "Take Terry. I need Mitch." Dad! Dad! Dad! - All those nights - I'd hear him in his sleep. - Ah! Stay low. Stay forward. Forget the names they sing at you through the screen. - Ah! Such preparedness. I'd lie awake and think. - Ah! And so I got accustomed to the view from here. You watch them come at you in waves. You watch 'em fly away. Go, go, go! A brief flicker of relief but they'll be back. To knock on the gate one more time. I could leave. But where would I go? This is my only home. - Bob! Jack Adams. Listen, about that goalie you're hiding up there in the frozen north, I'm hearing good things. Suit him up with the Spitfires, will ya'? Time to see what young Mr. Sawchuk can do. - Okay. Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - Well, I'll certainly get onto that. - Lil! Is there no way to make this water a bit hotter? All aboard! - We'll be doing without 'cause I'm giving that to you. Think about that before you piss it all away. - I'm gonna turn this into bags of money, Mom. I'm going to send it all back home on this very train. - Don't be proud. Uh... Go on. You'd miss your train standing a foot away from it, you would. For my money, Jack Adams wanted to bring Terry down to Windsor to get a glimpse across the river at the Detroit skyline. Because he was known to do things like that. They say he did the same thing to Harry Lumley a few years earlier. At the time, teams had only one goalie One sweater per team. Detroit had Lumley and he'd just won them the Stanley Cup. - Hey, Burnsie, Burnsie! - No one shuts the door like this man! No one shuts the door like Lumley! - Mr. Adams! You had a lot of skeptics questioning how you put the team together this year. Bet you felt the pressure. Bet ya' feel like a clever dog now! - I'm not the one out there on the ice. Sometimes the sports desk gets it right. I am the clever dog. Harry Lumley has traded his goalie stick for a pair of crutches tonight. He'll be okay. The question is will Detroit be okay? We're hearing good things about this kid from Winnipeg, Terry Sawchuk. Hey, Lumley! His head's too big for your sweater. - Hope you figure that out before you get in front of the net, kid. - Lumley, you're like his mom. - You get that first shot, kid, you'll be fine. Yep, there he is. Who's game you gonna play today, son? - Yours. - Yours. - Mine. At our level, right off the top. We're gonna grind these sons of bitches down, boys! Let's go, Red Wings. Let's go! - Open the door! There we go. Goalie goes first! Hup! Go! Up, up, up! Huh. It seems Mr. Sawchuk has a style all his own. Boston scores! - You paid three large for him? - I got it down to two in the end. Yes. - Well, I don't see what all the fuss is about. - I promise not to tell anyone you said that. Don't trade Lumley yet! The whiz kid misses the first shot. He's really got to look at his stance in the net there. - Okay, now listen, kid: this is no different from the minors. All right? Just bigger pay cheques and better women. You like women, don't ya'? - Yeah. - It's like if we were brothers. Yup, yup. Boston's got the puck. They're on the attack again. Ferguson shoots. Sawchuk stops the puck! - Yeah, they had a few, uh, a few chances in the third. Uh, but we kept in it. The players up here, they don't try the same trick twice. I learned that much. But, uh, mistakes like that, they cost me a couple goals tonight and I won't let the same thing happen on Wednesday. Oh, uh, either one of you have a nickel so I could call my mom? Holy Shinola, Louis. You better listen to this! In hockey news, Detroit Red Wings goalie Harry Lumley has been traded to the Chicago Blackhawks. Shit. Yeah, I'm shocked. Uh, I had no idea. We just won the Cup. But, as they say, who buys a house in Detroit with Adams running the show, right? Trader Jack is showing his hand. It'll be his farm team phenom, Terry Sawchuk, leading the team come training camp time. ♪ So I'm telling me ♪ ♪ to pack my bags ♪ ♪ It's time for moving on ♪ ♪ I'm bound to do some reveling ♪ ♪ It's time to travel on. ♪ - Can I help you, Sir? Um... No. Sorry. - Wait a minute. You're Detroit's new goalie. - And so he is. Mr. Terry Sawchuk. We got royalty in here. - Can I get an autograph for my son? - Uh... Sure. Uh... - Saw something you liked in the window? - No. I, uh... I can't afford 'em. - Now, they pay you, don't they? - What? Uh, yeah. But then I pay my landlord and then the rest goes to my parents. - Good man. But you're going to have to look sharp now that you're representing Detroit. I'll let you pay two dollars a week, no interest. You'll have 'em paid off by January. - Janu-? Well, they won't do me much good in the dead of winter. - Nonsense. You wear them out today. - You'd let me do that? - If you stiff me, I know where to find you, don't I? - Stopping those dirty French pucks! - Yeah. I, uh... Yeah. I sure hope so. - Now, son: in Detroit we expect you to bring more than just hope. - I'll try 'em on. - All right, all right. - Thank you. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Terry. Fancy shoes. Making me work for my tips today. - I gotta break in these shoes, I guess. - Hm. - Stew, huh? Is that going to be as good as my mother's Ukrainian dumplings? - I don't think I can serve you in here. - Well, why not? - You look like a hockey player. - I am. - Well, if you played for Detroit, I'd have noticed you before. - I'm Detroit's new goalie. - Hm. Then I guess I'll serve you. I just won't get too attached. As for the dumplings, I've never tried 'em. But I bring 'em home to Bobby some nights and he's a big fan. Stew like his Mama's. The Montreal-Detroit rivalry is as heated as ever. That one goes all the way up to the front offices of the Detroit General Manager, Jack Adams and Montreal's Frank Selke. The score is tied three to three with seconds left on the clock. It's in! The ref calls it a goal and Montreal ekes out a win with Detroit nipping at their heels. Montreal still holds the better record and no one hates losing more than Jack Adams. Ha-ha-ha. Take 'er easy, Jack! A ways to go before spring. - Lil! The radio's fallen. Hey! What are you so happy about? We lost. - I know, but I have a special friend supposed to visit me tonight. - Oh, yeah? What's his name? That's his name. - Hey! Uncle. Hey, don't mind Boiter. He's gotta touch every player after a game. - Whoa-whoa-whoa! Gordie says if you want to touch him, it's gotta be his balls. - Get off me! - Come on, come on! - Get off me! - Cool down. - Hey, uh, snappy shoes! - Oh, yeah. - You must've shelled out for 'em. - Oop. Maybe pull it? - Come on; little pull. Yeah, pull it, pull hard. Harder. Come on. There you go. That's it. That's it. - Whoever did this is paying for it! - C'mon, Terry. It's just fun. - So, how are you settling in with the boys? There you go, son. - Thank you. - There won't be anything in your life after like belonging to a team. Take it from a land of experience. No. Where does this sort of sacrifice and loyalty exist anymore, right? Nah. It's an ancient game with ancient laws. But, God, I love it. Mm. Going to have to get you some new shoes, I see. The fellas got a bit of a sense of humour there. - Oh, no. Mr. Adams, I-- - Mr. Sawchuk, if there's one thing I know in this world to be true: you are worth the investment. - Thank you. - Please. Oh, that really is nice on the toes. - Yeah? Pronovost, tough as a bag of batteries. He gets the puck to me, I see Delvecchio open... - You get a chance, you gotta make the best of it. - Of course. - And then Sawchuk. Yeah. Then Terry with the save. - Mm. Sawchuk, tonight, it was like... Hey! Great game. Speech. - Yeah. - Speech, speech! Uh, I thought it was a team effort. Um... I thought we really took it to 'em tonight, we played a full 60 minutes and, uh, I'm really looking forward to the playoffs, that's for sure. Yeah. - Mr. Sawchuk, everyone's saying you got the skills to become one of the greatest goalies in history. - Thank you. - In my experience... - That's it. Good game. - Get a load of all that, huh? Everybody loves a winner. I need eight more of them to get the cup. Can you get me eight wins? - Okay. - All right. - Ah! - Jesus! Oi! Ahh! Amazing save by Sawchuk! Detroit is one period away from sweeping Toronto out of the playoffs. A date with Montreal within reach! Jesus! Holy cow. - How's he doing? We need this one. - No, Jack. It's his elbow again. The doc says he needs surgery. - Surgery? Get off him. - Yeah. How you feelin', son? Huh? Look at that face. Tough as nails. I knew it the first time I set eyes on him. You need this one, Jack. Toughness! Heart! This is your man, I said. - If he goes out there, it's not gonna heal proper. - You know they popped out his eye one time when he played in the minors? Took a stick blade right to the eye. They just patched it up and popped it back in. No. Someone plays with that kind of heart and that kind of sacrifice for his team? That's someone that you do not send to the hospital unless he says he needs to go! Huh? You ready to play. - Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. - You ready to win this game? - I can go back in. I'm good. Let's go. Let's go! Let's go! All right! - Ha. Hoo. Upsy-doodle. Yeah. You wish you had this kind of heart! Okay. Out on the ice, with the game on the line, that's where I was alive. When you saw those words up over the arena doors "Hockey tonight", man, they picked up your step. They told you life was good, the woman with you was just the right woman, whichever joint you were heading for was just the place to be before the game. Detroit leaves Montreal after taking the first two games of the Stanley Cup finals! - That's three games in the books, boys. We got Montreal on their heels. But I'll tell ya': the game that ends a team's season is the hardest one to win. Yeah. They're against the ropes. Gettin' desperate. - Yeah. - Where's Terry? - Mmm. I-I think- I think he left. - It's not a joke. Where is he? - Didn't he, uh, didn't he mention getting a haircut? - No, no. I think he talked about, like, an ingrown toenail or something. - Ingrown toenail. - Yeah. I think... - It's not funny, you guys! Fuck you guys! You know, it's on you too! I have a shit game, we all have a shit game. - Yeah. - Right? - Right. - Can you read? - Yeah, yeah. - He better be in the trainer's room. - Is he gone? Let's get the fuck outta here. - Just be quiet, okay? - Yeah. Come on. Go-go-go-go! Terry. Quit it. You're gonna burn a hole right through her. - What? You like her? - No. - Which one? - No. Marcel. - Right there? - No, no, no, no. She has a boyfriend, Bobby, or something. - Hey! Excuse me. Yeah. Please. - Hay is for horses. - Oh. - Oh. Okay, uh... Pardonnez moi, Mademoiselle. But, um, may I bother you for a second? Do you know who this is? You're looking at our ticket to the top right there. - I'm working. - Okay, pardon me. We were just wondering if, um... Bobby's still in the picture? - Bobby's still in the picture. Only has three legs now since the tractor ran over him. Thank you so much for asking. Bobby's my dog. Okay. You're in! - I'm so sorry. I don't know... Okay. So, he lives at... - No, Marcel. No, I... - Yes. He lives at 67 Military Road. - I-I... I do live there, though. Not with parents, or anything. - Wh-? No, no! Wait, wait, wait. She's not even gonna... It's game over. You're gonna have to jerk it. - You're a fuckin' idiot. That was smooth. - Yeah. - Really smooth. - Good job. - Yeah? Yeah? Very smooth. Asshole. - Let's go out there and take it, boys. - It's our game tonight. - Full energy right off the hop, boys. Gonna get to our game: speed. You are going to dump those pucks in deep. You will own the neutral zone. No mercy. No mercy. We will finish them off tonight. Who's ready? Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah? Ukey, you stand on your head all season. Tonight any different? - No different. - No different. Pronovost! Ready to make their lives miserable? Yes. Yeah. - How are you feeling, son? - Good, sir. Good. - Gordie, you ready to take another walk around this block? - Yes, sir. - Yeah, yeah. - No matter what happens in this building, you and I know, we know the game is played between those blood red posts. All right, this is it. Here we go. Nothin' else matters but tonight, boys. Montreal? Montreal's got nothin' on you! Go, go! - Open the door. Goalie goes first. You got the greatest goaltender in the league at one end. The kid. Sawchuk. Bearing down on him, the greatest goal scorer in hockey history: Rocket Richard. This is one for the history books, ladies and gents. Hold your families close. Take the phone off the hook! Detroit could win it all tonight. Welcome to the first elimination game of the Stanley Cup finals! Out on the ice, with the game on the line everyone depending on me. Half into an animal crouch, like some poor bugger getting drilled before a firing squad. Too late for last words. Christ! - Dick, you gotta take it easy. - We've got three times the shots on goal but it's three-nothing for them. How do you beat Sawchuk? He knows what you're gonna do before you do it. I lie awake at night. I think my wife's gonna leave me. - Coach, you in mid-stroke? - Harvey, what the fuck was that? - Uh, that's an octopus. - A what? Am I losing my damn mind? Eight legs. Eight wins. Fuckers. We wanted it bad, yeah. But, uh, you know, Terry was possessed. Oh, we tried to stay up, but... we knew crawling back from a three-nil deficit with him in the net was impossible. Skate, skate, skate! - What are you, nuts? - I hate nuts. - Terry, I got it. Are you nuts? Huh? Are you nuts? Huh? - Hey, Ref, you seen a goddamn referee tonight? - All right, all right. - Get back, Terry. - Good job, Marcel. Miss it. Ah! ...nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Detroit wins the cup! Here we go! Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho! Pretty intense for your first NHL game, hey there, call-up? No. We're always ready in Edmonton for when we get our chance. - Who's good up there, anyway? - Gotta see this goalie, Glenn Hall. Spreads like a butterfly. - Oh, hear that, Uke? You better watch your back; got a butterfly in the wings. - Okay. Here's the deal: you're going to put chicken bones in Boiter's hockey bag. See if he washes it over the summer or if it's covered in maggots next fall. - Hey, hey, hey! You and I are going to be doing this a lot more, Terry. - Proud of you boys! Enjoy! - Want some? Wake up in a pool of your own vomit. - Yeah, it's good to be home. But I'll be ready to get back once fall hits, that's for sure. - Yeah, speakin' of getting back, I should. - What? No. See you at the plant, boys. What are you do--? No. I'm buying. Stick around. - Lucky for you, your dad got you on. They're cutting jobs. - You been up to see Mitch yet? - No, not yet. I'm gonna get up there. Just want to unwind, you know? There's a lot of pressure down there. But, hey, if things keep going like this, I could get a good salary real soon, maybe I could get you and mom a nicer house. - Nicer? - Not nicer. Just, I-- I could send more money home. - Yeah. We should get going. - Yeah. Yeah. - Your mother'll want to see you in the morning. - Yeah. I think I might stick around for one more. - Suit yourself. - Hey! Can I get one more before I head home? Yeah, just one more. It's nice to be home. Nice to be home. - Hello? - Pronovost! Hey! It's Uke. How you doing? - Jeez, Terry? - Yeah. - You all right? It's two in the morning. - Yeah, what, what are you doing? I just, uh, you know, I was wondering if you remember what game it was we pulled that prank on Boiter? 'Cause I gotta-I gotta-I gotta group of people here and they were, uh... they-they were wondering and I said, I know who has the memory of a fucking elephant. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I'll ju-I'll let you go. I was-- Hey, wait! Have you heard anything about, um... Jack is happy, right? He-he's happy with the way the team as it is, right? - Uh, I don't know, Terry. Why don't you call him at two in the morning and ask him? - Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going. Ah! Ahhh! Think God lets dogs in heaven? Sure he does. In heaven they're allowed inside and they're even allowed to drink Cokes. Where the hell is my kettle?! Hey! Hey! - Ah-ha! Mr. Norris: there's your team. This bunch here? They play like they could read each other's minds. Magical! - For what I shell out, they better be damn genies. Yeah, I got it. Yes, indeed. Go back for that. Come on, I'll pass you one. - Terry Sawchuk. - In the flesh. - Flesh is right. He got fat. Good job, ladies. - I'll make damn sure he burns it off, sir. - Yeah. All right. Let's go. - Hey, Ter. Come on in. - Mr. Norris. Nice to see you again. - How are you, Terry? - Good. Good. - Uh, let's get you on the scale, huh, son? Let's see what we got here. All right. Up. Oh, boy. All right. Let's try this. - You know what? Let me try it again without the cigarette in my hand. Yeah, sure. You spend the off-season eating Ukrainian dumplings out of the Calder Trophy? Game time. You're going to drop the weight. Right? The fans, they're fickle. They love you one night and hate you the next. Let's not give them a reason. - I'll get the weight down. - All right. - Okay. Good. Hit that door on your way out, if you wouldn't mind. - Okay. - The football player. - Hockey. - I don't care much for either. My Dad owns this place so I fake it. Hockey's good for business. - Well, I'm a goalie. And the job of the goalie is to stop the puck from going in the net. And when you do... you're the hero. When you don't, you come to the bar alone. - Looks like it gets pretty rough. Oh, oh, oh! - Try that again, Merle, and I'll dig it into the back of your skull! Jeez. Jesus! What are you, part lion? - Maybe I should have a goalie to stand right there between me - and all of them. - You mean a defenseman. - I think I'd rather a goalie. You hungry? Tonight's gravy's so thick you could walk on it. - I'll just take a whiskey. What's going on in Detroit? The Wings are not the same team they were last year. Come on! - Which team you playing for, Marcel? - Detroit. - You're hanging me out to dry! Hanging me out to dry. - Huh. Feeling the need for a drink after that one. - Naw, I, uh... No. - Yeah. - Fucker. Get out of here. Christmas, with his foot in a cast. That came off and Pulford skated over three of his fingers. Besides starving himself, cuts, bruises, disc ruptures from that crouch, he was only sleeping three hours a night. But he would've remembered what happened when Lumley was out with a broken ankle. - Great. You're not gonna believe this: Glenn Hall is in town doing a hockey camp. Just left his hotel for the airport. We're going to... - No, No, No. - Catch him at the airport - Forget the freeze. Forget the freeze. Just stitch me up and get me back out there. - Have you seen your face? - Let him go. We're good here. We're good here. - All right, forget it. I guess we're good here. Stitch him up! - It's only a couple years since they tossed him Lumley's sweater. Six goalies in the league. One sweater per team. With general managers short on cotton and patience, we goalies were constantly looking over our shoulders. Sawchuk, Sawchuk, Sawchuk, Sawchuk. - You love me tonight, do ya'? Go fuck yourselves. - Hey. Hey, Terry. Come on, darlin'. Hey, let's go. - My jacket. - Yeah. - My jacket. - I got it. I got it. - Okay. Go to bed, honey. - Mm-hm. - I'm not drunk. I just, I didn't have dinner. - All right. Detroit loses a fourth straight despite Sawchuk turning away an unbelievable 48 shots on goal. - Terry, what were you thinking when you let that easy one by in the third? - I don't know. - Is the pressure to repeat the season you had last year getting to you? - Why don't you get out there and take 50 shots to the face? I'll ask how you feel about it, okay? - Hey. Out. Where are we? Where are we!? - Detroit. - No, you invalid. Rock bottom! That's where we are! And you sorry sons of bitches better figure out a way to climb out. Unless you wanna be playing for Coal Mine Workers of America next season which is all you'll be fit to do! And you: not enjoying the pucks coming at ya'? Maybe you're not fit for the job anymore. - We're out of the playoffs anyway. - What did you say? - I said we're out of the playoffs anyway. We got five games left. And they don't mean anything and I got these press jerkoffs rubbing my face in shit. - Yeah, yeah. No. You don't want that. You don't want shit in the face. Get down and shit on the floor. Shit on the floor!! You can't even fucking do that right? I got no room on my hockey club for anyone who can't take the heat. - Jack. Jack's a dumb name. Jack. It sounds like a cat throwing up. - You wouldn't name a kid Jack? - Not on your life. Maybe... Penelope? - I like Anthony. - Mm. I had a regular named Anthony. He always took his pants off when he drank Canadian whiskey. - I bet when you name your kid Anthony, you forget about all the Anthony's that you didn't like before. - I didn't say I didn't like him. You know, I always liked the name Charles. - Chuck? Chuck? Chuck Sawchuk? - Who says my babies are gonna be Sawchuks? - Well, I'm not sittin' here coming up with baby names for you and some other fella. - Mm. Wow. You don't waste any time. - Take your shot when you, uh... when you get the chance. But if Jack trades me, I'm going to have to start all over with some Catholic girl from Boston or a French girl from Montreal. Oh, I hear they're spicy. - What kind of dad would you be, anyway? Always on the road. Never home. - No, no way. No way. I'd flood the yard, make a rink. I'd teach 'em all to play hockey. Have my own little team of midgets. Bet on 'em. Retire. - Okay. - Okay? Oh... Okay? O-okay what? Okay. Okay, okay, what? Okay, you'd marry me? - If-if that's what you're asking? - Well, yeah. It is now! - Well, then yeah! - What if I got hurt and I couldn't play? - That's easy. I'd just leave you for Merle the drunk. He's going to inherit a fortune when his mother dies. I would live in a railway car and beg for a living if it meant that I got to do it with Mr. Terry Sawchuk. You just have to promise me one thing: that every now and then you'll take your mind off hockey. My mind's not on hockey now. - Terry. - Hey. I, um... I'm sick about how we went out this year. I let the pressure get to me. - Two years in a row you win the Vezina trophy and all you think about are the pucks that got in? - I'm getting married. - Well, congratulations. - Yeah, I know you said to stay away from the girls, so I-I figured I'd do it in the off season. - Oh, that's smart. - Yeah. But come fall, I'll be focused on my game. - Good. Not worried about it. - Yeah. Just, uh, just thinking about the future, you know? Um... Maybe buy a house. Just... Just not sure. - Hm. You and me, huh? Always in the balance if we don't perform. I think of you as a son, Terry. I expect to be invited to that wedding. A shot from the point... Sawchuk bats at it. Wait! He's down. He's hit. Sawchuk is down and the puck is in the net! - You all right? - You maybe see some, ah, teeth around here, - would you, buddy? - You got it. Sawchuk! That goal light's gonna give you a sunburn. - What son of a bitch said that? That stuff doesn't bother these guys. Terry is a professional. They just tune that stuff out. - Right there. - Sawchuk. Sawchuk! - Oh, no, no. - Yeah? Not sure that's the case this time! - Tabernac! Oh, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! Do you want to get in there, huh? Huh? Do you want to get in the fuckin' net? - No! No! - Get the fuck out! You better run! You better run, boy! - Damn it! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - Fan hit a nerve there, huh, Terry? - Okay, fellas, I could use... Give me a minute. I'm in a little pain, here. - How do you think kids who look up to you will feel about you going after a fan? - Okay. Please, guys, he asked for a minute. Just give him some space, okay? Please, please. - Do you know how many people would want to be in your position? - Okay, come on. That's enough! - I think this is the first time in hockey we've seen someone crack under pressure like-- - That's enough! I said-- What the fuck are you doing? - It's okay. Calm down. - All right. Let's go, fellas. You got enough, huh? Thanks. You! What the hell? It's not bad enough that in the supermarket they're asking my wife, "What the goddamn is the matter with Terry Sawchuk?" Now, what are these guys gonna write? How's it gonna look, huh? That the inmates are running the ship! - I'm the one standin' on my head out there! - Maybe you need to rest? - No. - Yeah. I'm calling Glenn Hall up from Edmonton. - You know what? That pond hockey hick won't last a fucking game! Belliveau gets it up the ice to Geoffrion who shoots. Kicked away by Hall! This kid's coverage is something else. - Terry, you hungry? - What? - The Canadiens are testing him tonight. - Steak, salad, Jello. All your favorites. - Goddammit, Pat! I don't want any food next to the chesterfield. Shh! It's fine! - Sawchuk's injury seemed a real blow to the Wings fighting for a playoff spot. But Hall's proving himself nicely. Jack Adams must be feeling relieved at that. - He's gonna replace me. - Hey. - He's going to replace me. - No. - He's done with me. One day he's calling me "son" and then the next day I'm out in the fucking cold! - You don't need him. - Jesus Christ, Pat! I can't eat this fattening shit! Another shot gloved by Hall-- - I, uh... I'm sorry. It's not you. You're the only good thing. - It's okay. I know this has been tough. - Six goalies in the league. One sweater per team. You're working paycheque to paycheque. You're barely scraping by. Yeah. The good old hockey game. It'll ask for everything you got and, in the end, it'll kill ya'. Goalies first. - Hey! Hey, can I get in there? Read a catcher in baseball once said: "There must be some reason we're the only ones facing the other way." Hm. - Hey. It's like I'm holding God. Hi. - He would have thrown himself in front of a bus for that team in the first five years. That's the kind of goalie he was. That's right, Mr. Terry Sawchuk has been traded from the Detroit Red Wings to the Boston Bruins. - Hello. - It's a boy. It's a boy. Well, I-I... Wonder how he's gonna like living in Boston? - Boston? - Just heard it on the radio. They traded you to the Bruins. - Hey, pal. - My wife had a baby. - Yeah. I know that. - Good. - But know what? I think we should go see her. Come on. I'll drive ya'. Hm? - I think Jack should meet him. - Okay, listen, man: it's two in the morning. Jack is not even in the building. Come on. Let's go home. I'll drive you. Please. Get in the car. - No! Fuck the car! - Please? - He never even came to the wedding. - Yeah, I know. Well, I did. I came to the wedding. Come on. Hm? Let's go home. - You had a name card, Jack! - Sh, sh, sh. Terry, listen: gonna be okay. Hm? - I'm going to miss you, brother. - I'll miss you, too. Right now, time to go to bed. - Mm. Okay. - That's it. Okay. Follow me. Go take a shower, ya' bunch a fuckin' bums! Ya' need it! - So, who gets to kill that guy? Pathetic pouters. Pull your heads out of your asses and compete out there! You're an embarrassment. We got Terry Sawchuk in goal! We finally have a chance to make the playoffs so just pull it together. This is our barn. We let them walk into our barn and piss all over our barn. Shit's spraying all over our barn, boys, let me tell you. Who's going to clean up that shit, huh? Hm? Our barn stinks like shit! And so do you! See, guys? This... This is the team bonding we need! We're-- We're brothers! This is how it's supposed to be! Come on, man. Look, we're a team! Who's doing that? Schmidt's right! We could make the playoffs with Terry backstopping us but we... We gotta bond. Cal's never been on a roller coaster. Who's never been on a roller coaster? Well, let's go to a bar! Hey? You guys want to go to a bar? All right. Well, let's hit the showers, and then we'll hit the town! Okay. - You want to come for a drink, Terry? - Uh, maybe some other time. - All right. We let Sawchuk go because we found ourselves with two top goalies. Hall is more advanced now than Sawchuk was when he joined us. - Boston's not so bad, Terry. Unless we get those funny accents. You don't think little Jerry and Jr. are going to speak with those accents do you? Bowston. - I'm serious. I'm serious. Call the school and complain if the kids talk like that. It's not right. You were all so close in Detroit and then to hear about it from your parents-- Fantastic. Clean that up before your kid crawls in it. - He doesn't even know how to crawl. - Jack's not your family. We're your family. He used you. - He needed me. - Jack is a guy who got you to shatter your bones to line his pocket. - You don't know what you're talking about. - You didn't get paid as much as Gordie. Colleen let that slip. - Old elbow's acting up again. My friend, Audrey, she's a nurse, she says when a bone doesn't set right, it'll hurt forever. - Well, can't blame this one on Jack. It happened when I was a kid. I never had it set. - You're parents didn't? - Uh, they didn't know. They didn't like weakness. Especially in kids. What, your father'd whup you if you broke your arm? - My mother was worse. - Well, I believe that. I'm going to put you down. - Hey, buddy. - He's sleepy. - I ever tell you about Lady's puppies? When I tried to bring 'em back to life? - Magic? - Woodstove. Our dog had, um, her puppies under the porch. 50 below winter. And she wanted in but fat chance of that in the Sawchuk household, they barely let us in. I remember those puppies. Raw little chicken things, frozen to the-- to the wood beam. I tried to-I tried to not tear their little legs. Mom wouldn't have a three-legged dog, not like you, Pat. I got taught a lesson that day, boy. That dog just wandered in circles for days. For days. You could-- You could trace its path in the snow in blood. I never saw grief in my mother's eyes like I did-- Like I did in that dog's. Not even when Mitch-- Not even when Mitch, uh... - When Mitch died. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm gonna wake the baby. - He's used to your temper tantrums, he'll sleep right through. - My temper tantrums? - I was just making light. - You're always saying that to me. - I'm sorry, Terry. - Why would you say that to me? Don't try and make me stay when you know I gotta go 'cause I'm going to regret something if you try and make me fucking stay! - Please don't go. - Another one. - I wonder if you haven't had enough there, sir? Why, Davy, this is Mr. Terry Sawchuk, Boston's very famous goalie. What if downing a bottle the night before a game is what makes him so good. Hm? Maybe bourbon is his little secret. - Now I have to kill you. - That's a great pick-up line. Don't worry, I'll get him home. And that one? - Henri Richard. And that one? - Nesterenko. Game four of the '52 series. - How about the bruises? - Practice. - And the shiner? - Practice. - You okay? - Yeah. I, uh... - Oh. - I'll see ya'. - Yeah. Look for me on the ice, sweetheart! I'll be the one wearing number 25. - Fucker. - You're out, Cal! - Fuck you. Who says I'm out? - It's "don't touch the floor", man! The rules are in the title. - He's still got it. Richard! Richard! - You dropped him, Ross! That's a fucking disgrace. Do you like my belt? - Oh, Jesus. Get that away from me! Hey! Gardner! Gardner! Do you like my-- Ow!! - Willie, I just need my hair, man. Aw, fuck! - End of the fucking world. In hockey news, Terry Sawchuk takes on his old team tonight as Boston heads to Detroit. Sawchuk! Sawchuk! Sawchuk! Sawchuk! - There he is. Hey, there. Come have a seat, son. - I, um... That's for the shoes. - What? - I never paid you back. I don't like owing people. - Come on, now. Sit down, please. - Oh, uh... - Okay, I traded you. It's a team, not a family. - I never thought it was a family. - You weren't the only one worried about his job. It's a shit part of mine too, you know. If I were a cattle farmer, feeding and looking after calves and cows every day and one of them stands out, a great one, that I care about, maybe more than the others, that doesn't mean he still won't end up on the barbeque. My job is to make sure the best team is on the ice every day. - And I don't belong on the best team? - You played half the season injured. - And why was that? - Lumley's day came too. - I'll leave you to the slaughter. - Here it comes. Here it comes. And the pitch... He scores! - Danny! That son of a bitch is drunk again. - Oh, my God. Are you crazy? Get in here. Do you know what these folks do for me when you're out of town? They take our garbage to the curb. - I don't want those busy-noses going through our garbage, looking for autographs. Why you got diapers here for!? - Terry! What are you doing? - I'm using the bathroom. - For heaven's sakes. I've had it! - Oh, now, now, you woke up the baby. - Jerry? Jerry. - You found us! - Yeah. You're such a big boy. Here, pass me your sister. - Yeah, Pat, you should have married the banker. He wouldn't be drinking and yelling so much!! - Can you pass me that suitcase? Good job. We are going to tell Santa to come visit us at Nanny and Poppy's this year. - When it all-when it- when it comes to an end and the big one comes? When the big one comes, Pat, those fucking pussies will be crawling in their holes and I'll be out howlin' at the fuckin' moon. Tree inside the house? - Wanna help Momma pack? - Yeah. - Hey, hey! - Okay, honey, no, let's stop that. Hey! What are you doin'? - We're going to Detroit. - Detroit is a shit-hole. What are you doing? - We are going to the house until you can get a hold of yourself. Come on, Jerry, let's go. - The house in Detroit? - Yes. - I sold the fuckin' house, Pat. - You what? - What do you think, I'm made of money? How are you gonna get to Detroit anyway, huh? Did you take money from my drawer, Pat? Did you take fuckin' money from my drawer? Did you fuckin' take money from my drawer, huh!? Did you? - Stop it! Jerry, go, go. - I'm sorry. - Go downstairs. - I'm sorry. Hey, hey, Pat. Oh, fuck... Oh! Pat, I'm sorry. It's the pressure. I'll be better once we make the playoffs. - We love your dad but we're not allowed to let him treat us like this. - What are you doing? - I need the keys. - What, are you going to take the kids out in the cold? - I need the goddamn keys! - There's the fucking keys. - Oh, Terry! - I told you I'll be better once we make the playoffs. - Jerry, let's go. Come on, honey. Come on. Boston is out of the playoffs! Their loss is Newfoundland's gain as India beer presents the boys from Boston from the brewers of India Beer. Nobody can get a thing past Hall tonight as Detroit dominates the Leafs in round one. Everyone thought Adams was crazy to trade Sawchuk. Maybe he knew what he had in Hall more than he knew what Sawchuk's battered body could give. - Come on, guys. Let's get in the spirit. We're making 25 bucks a game here. It's not playoff money but it'll get us through to next season. So let's have some fun! Well, it looks like we're playing in the great outdoors tonight. - Let's make the playoffs next year. Hey. Goalie goes first. Going to show us them there fancy moves, boys, or what? Terry, keep your fingers off the screen. - You gotta look after your goalie. Whew. Who comes out to see a game like this? You heard anything from Pat? Well, good game. Good, leave it there, leave it there. Come on, here, here, here! Hey, hey! You want your fucking shot? Hold it, hang on, hang on. - You want your fucking shot? Hang on, hang on. Terry, Terry. Look, that guy got 11 older brothers, all right? He gets a bit competitive. Boys, it's an exhibition, all right. It's supposed to be a bit of fun. Keep the shots down, for Christ's sake. Good game, Terry. Thanks for that. - Wolves out there? - Nah. Moose, bear. N'ar wolf. - Seems like a place for wolves. - You should come see my ice. All right, Terry, you gotta tell me: Wings, Habs. Is it true if they're on the same train they gotta put a dining car in between 'em? - You wouldn't let them hunt together. - That's madness. - Thanks. - Yeah, my youngster did that. It's actually of my father. He taught me everything I know about fishing. Lost him at sea. - Boat sunk or...? - Well, he was a swiler, a sealer and, uh, they would take the boats out and when the pack ice was thick enough, they would just walk miles and miles and miles. Back in those times, maybe for days. And this one time, they were out pretty far and a blizzard came in and 120 of 'em got trapped, couldn't make a move for two days, and they didn't have the right gear on, they didn't have anything to make a fire with. Just out in the blizzard, waiting, right. - Jesus. - The ones who survived were the ones who kept moving, you know. They said that they, uh, that they would chew icicles off each other's faces just to just to keep from being overtaken by the ice. I was in the crowd when the boat came in. And they brought the corpses off and they were still frozen in the positions that they were in when they perished, right, how they found them. Many of them hunched over in prayer. Pop was one of them. - Yeah, there's hard ways to make a living in this world. - Yeah, but that said, he was the finest kind of man. Good to his family, quick with a joke. Enjoyed his time on earth, I think. I suppose there's not much more you can ask than that. - What size are your, uh, your feet, Phil? - What? - I'm going to leave these with you. - Your skates. - Yeah. - I don't like the Habs that much. - Oh, fuck hockey. I mean, nothing hinges on hockey, does it? It's hardly life or death. I'm sick as a dog, I'm exhausted all the time. So do you want the skates 'cause I'll throw 'em down the hole? - Well, there's no need to startle the fish. - I quit. I'm out. - I heard on the radio. - I was wondering if you'd still like to live in a railway car with me? - You're lucky I'm a Catholic, Terry, I swear to God. - Good one. Come here. Here. They're expensive. Be careful. I'm coming around. - Jesus. - Okay, okay. Come here, come here, Jerry. - You gonna send that one to your dad? - Yeah. "Look, Anne, Terry raised a pussy." - Where's his hat, Terry? - Oh, it's in the car. He's fine. - Okay. - How's she doing? - Good. - Good. - All right, here we go. - Get her in there. - Ahh. - She's cold. - That's much better, right? - All right, here we go. - Ooh. - Up you go. Why don't we get outta here? - Huh? - I don't know. Let's go to California. We can do whatever we want, can't we? No one's telling me where I gotta live anymore. - That's true. - But how would Santa's sleigh ever get to us? - That's a good point, son. That's a very good point. We're going to talk about that at home, okay? Okay. Ah, warmer? Yeah. - Over my dead body. Oh, that back-stabbing Ted Lindsay is behind this union crap. And one of those fucks thought it'd be hilarious to put a dead cat on my car engine. Didn't see it for three days. - Jack Adams wasn't fond of the Player's Union, but when he unloaded all the offending players, he was left with quite a deficit. - I want to find out every one of them's behind this union bullshit. I'll trade 'em all to Siberia. - He was out. And it would have been a good career. But Jack was in trouble and he knew that he could get anything he wanted out of him. - My father said you didn't show up for work today. - Hello. Okay. Yeah. Catchers in baseball, closest to cousins. The safeguarding of home, healing of bones, the hatred that comes with defeat and only one of you. Denied the leap and dash up the ice. What goalies know is side to side. They scrape. Sweep. Like saints they pray for nothing. Off days what they want is space. They sit apart at bars.

By the time I'd met him he'd tried to quit two or three times, get his wife back, spend an October with his family. You liking the city? Good. I just want to give you a little intro, let you know how I coach in case it's different than what you're used to. Some fellas run their teams like dog teams. I don't. We're goin' with two goalies this year, not to, uh, set you against each other but to take the pressure off. Get the best out of both of ya'. Johnny gets that. He's a good guy. - Hey, Bower. Nice shoes. - Thanks, man. - Can I see that one? Just the one closest to me. - This one? - Yeah, just pass it to me. - Come on, guys. - Hey, Johnny, Johnny. Why'd you do that to your shoes? - Ooh! - You okay? You're next. Toronto's a team of old bones. You got to wonder if they can square up against the youthful Canadiens? - Stop-stop-stop-stop. Ah, that's good, that's good. No-no-no. Johnny's playin' way better. - Yeah, right. You just want another night off, you lazy bugger. Big game. C'mon, coach. Elbow's shot. Vertebrae's ruptured-- You saw me last game. - Have you read what the press is saying about you? You're playing like the Sawchuk of old. A man possessed. I'm not worried. This is what we live for. - Thanks for the pep talk, Coach. - Yeah. What the fuck? Grow up. I got a team of geriatrics here and it's still a damn nursery school. Now, listen up: it might be game six but for us it's game seven, boys. This is our home. We go back to Montreal tomorrow, all bets are off. We can win it tonight. Let the goalie go first. Unbelievable save. Sawchuk is making up the game as he goes and it's electrifying here at Maple Leaf Gardens at the moment. Here we go for the face-off. 50 seconds on the clock, Stanley talking to Kelly and we're ready to go. The puck is dropped, Kelly gets it to Pulford who puts it on the tape for Armstrong who fires. And into the empty net. It's a goal! And a wild finish! The players are jumping out onto the ice. The Leafs have won the Cup!! The Leafs have won the Cup!! Sawchuk! Sawchuk! Sawchuk! Sawchuk! - 36 years you gave them. What they did is damned disrespectful. - What do you mean? You're making it sound like they let me go? - Oh. No, I just-- - Sons of bitches. - You want another one? - No, thanks. I don't know if I ever told you this but, uh, I grew up working in rat-infested grain elevators for 22 cents a day saving for skates. No-one should be that poor. All you mind is money. You'd chew someone's arm off to climb out of the hole you're in. - Glad you did. You changed the game. - When I got to Detroit, they were bankrupt. I couldn't have fucked it up any more. Picking players out of training camp, watching them grow... That was the stuff. - You were like a father to us. I kept that job 36 years off your backs. Some father. If I were your father, I'd say this: you can leave the game now, in fine style. You're not getting any younger. Track those kids of yours down, enjoy 'em. - I tried that. - Terry, you don't want to be some old soldier searching for a new war. Trust me. - That's not what you said when you pulled me back to Detroit. Ice is thicker than blood, you said. - You fell for that one too. - I never goddamn did any of this for you. I never did a fucking ounce of this for you. Or anybody else. - Yeah. Why don't you give Pat a call? See if she'll take you back home. - Home? - Yeah. - You saw me out there. I can play this game forever. Folks, get ready for six new hockey teams as the league approves expansion. Oakland and LA round out the new six. Strange to think of playing hockey in the heat, isn't it? That's gotta be on Mr. Terry Sawchuk's mind as the Leafs, only allowed to protect one goaltender, choose Johnny Bower over him. - I'm excited to be part of the Los Angeles organization and look forward to playing the best hockey of my career with the LA Kings. I sure am excited to be back with the Wings and look forward to playing the best hockey of my career right back here in Detroit. Certainly am looking forward to being in New York playing the best hockey of my career as a New York Ranger. Terry Sawchuk is celebrating his 103rd shutout! - I gave the kids some money for cokes. - Some Christmas they're having. - She's their grandmother. Is she lucid? - She keeps calling me Mitch. - Terry. - Why don't we go to Disneyland. Take the kids. - Maybe. - How could you live with yourself knowing that you missed their faces the first time they saw Mickey Mouse? - Your mother's gone. I'm sorry. - What do I do? Giacomin's tired. You wanna give him a minute? - The last time he was on ice was to give the real goalie a rest. - You ready? - Yeah, just give me another minute there, Ref. - All right, all right, wrap it up. - Okay. - In like a lion, they say. - No-no-no-no-no. I paid that bill two months ago! That was the bill for two months ago! The bill comes every month, man. - I want to see these. I'm getting fucking fleeced here. - What do you mean by that? - You think I got money? What, it's 'cause you'll never make as much money as me, huh? Now, don't walk away! Hey, hey, don't walk away. And so I got accustomed to the view from here. Stay low. Stay forward. - What were you thinking when you let that easy one by in the third? Boys, who do you think you're talking to here, a poet, a fucking philosopher? What was I thinkin'? Sawchuk himself insists that fellow Ranger, Ron Stewart is not at fault for his critical condition. - We were fighting... But all his life Terry took way worse knocks than that and he always bounced right back. It's all just like a bad dream. One can only pray that the Red Wings' famous goalie will not succumb to a ruptured gall bladder sustained in the fight. ...repeat the season you had last year getting to you? - That's all I have to say about him, I guess. Get me another. And how about one for my friend? We should get some food into you, Red. - It was something when, uh, above that door in the forum when you saw that sign that said "Hockey Tonight." Boy, when that organist began to hit those notes, just like a charge went through the crowd and... Everybody felt it, I felt it, I felt it. It was magic. In this tunnel, at this river, in the absence of time, it was here I could've been everything I dreamed of being. What was going through your mind, Terry? - What was going through my mind? Stop the fuckin' puck! Jesus. What would you want going through my mind? And the thought hits: at one time or another I might've been all I hoped to be, the guy you want behind you when the game was on the line, the guy you'd leave behind to guard your-- your ice-cold home. That cuts a bit. Cuts and comforts. Maybe I was the guy. Maybe I was him. - No goal! - And, uh, joke's on you. I don't have any friends. The winners want the clock to run out. The losers need more time. - So, Mr. Goalie, word has it you're leaving town again. Let the goalie go first. Open the door to the roaring lights and let the goalie go first. Fear what's on the way? What could there be about fear that I don't already know? Open the door. Infinity?
