It's been a while. What do you want? You haven't been to see Dad. Mom's mad at you. I'm busy... With work. You can take a day off. It's just an apparel office. Not really. Excuse me. Thanks. An espresso. Sure. They said it's a stroke. There'll be after-effects. His rehabilitation will take a while. Must be hard on Mom. Like it's not your problem. Why don't you just go and see him? I mean, he's been drinking a lot. I don't think he even took a day off work. After all this time, that's all you wanted to talk about? You're always weird when it comes to Dad. Oh? Why should you care? I'm still on the clock. Jiro's coming. Here you are. Oh, thank you. Why didn't you tell me? If I had, you wouldn't have come. Jiro did this? Can't you say something to him? There are those sexy stockings. She's into it today. Of course. Last time was terrible. You-know-who. What was that? No way. You like that son of thing. Oh, really? You like it, don't you? I didn't think he was that fit. Muscles, muscles. They must be calling to Nao. Oh, definitely. They sure are. It's the tank top. I'm looking forward to today. - Next time, Masami? - I'm done for the day. OK, bye. What's tonight's line-up like? Book smart. Hi, Ms. Katagiri. Book smart? Meaning...? Like college students? Of course not. She's happy- You like that kid. Muscle fetish. When are you off? You love the muscles. You wear contacts, Ms. Katagiri? - Uh-huh. - You're right. Isn't it usually the other way around? You wear glasses at work. Takuya said he loves how she takes them off. Takuya's such a pervert. You know? You're so pretty, you should use more make-up. Why don't you get dressed up and come out with us? I don't like drinking with lots of people. You should show more interest in men. That's right. No one's getting any younger. - See you. - Bye. You have 2 new messages. This is moue. There': A mistake on the order. I know it's the weekend, but take care of it, OK? Hello, it's Tajiri. Ms. Katagiri, please! The Shihuya Cardinal. Behind the department store. You know it, right? Where Michiko's wedding reception was? 8:30, even 9. Please come! Ifs an important party. Sugihara has to work... Please! Hello? Yes. Oh, really? I hadn't listened to my messages yet. No, don't worry. Have fun. OK, bye. OK, coming... - Yes? - It's me. Mina. Mina? Open up! Come on! What's this, all of a sudden? I need a reason to visit my own sister? I had another fight with Jiro. Excuse me! Hey. It's good. You're a good cook. What's this? Pickle. Cauliflower? Want some? Today... Work didn't go well or something... When I told him he was moody, he hit me again. Unbelievable. Are you spending the night? I can't? I don't have a guest bed. So? I can sleep with you. Hey. When I first came to Tokyo, I came and slept over a lot. Sis. Is the bath ready? Yes. What's that? It's for designing. - Let me see. - From when I was a student. You took an? I studied dressmaking. That's for dressmaking? You're out of conditioner! It's on the shelf! Hiroko, can I use this? Sure. You have a lot of products... for someone who doesn't use much make-up. Sweet bean shaved ice, like always. All that dieting for nothing. Just forget it! Hey. Why don't you just leave him? Sometimes, he's nice. Yes, but... You used to be the same. With guys like that. You just want to hold them. Like Jiro. I wonder why Mom ended up with someone like Dad? My Dad was pretty scary too. Do you remember your father, Sis? He ran away, right? Leaving you and Mom. I wish you'd shut up. Please, go ahead. This is the side brake, wipers, blinker... Um, I know. Please fasten your seat belt. I can get it. I've rented this car before. Oh, I see. Keep this someplace safe. Going on a date? That's nice. You live in ward 3, right? I'm right near there. That's nice. Oh, this navigation is new. Do you know how to use it? - You just... - I know! I know. Oh, I see. I see... Take care. Hey... Yes. Oh, Mina. No. He passed away? When? I see... You're going right away? OK. All right. Yes. Bye. You should take more time off and relax. It isn't like there's anything I can do. I haven't been home in a while. At this age, there's no reason to, except weddings or funerals. Where's home? Fukui. I ran out on a marriage interview. My parents were so mad... We'll have to face facts soon. - Masami? - Yes? Tomoko said she'll set us up with some guys. Really? She's not all talk? Sorry about before, Ms. Katagiri. Tomoko from design came. She loves those date parties. She took a guy home again. You should come to Tomoko's party, Ms. Katagiri. How about it? To unwind. I'll pass. Come on, let's go. You're no fun. What are you doing? Everyone was asking where you were, Hiroko! What did Mom say? Why don't you ask her? I'm not your messenger. Want to come in? I just came to give you this. It's from Mom. What is this? Funeral cake! OK, let's shoot the next one. Good expression last time, Yui. Was it? I'll try it again. Just like before. - OK, here we go. - OK, shooting the next one. - Ready. - Camera rolling. OK, cut 4. Shooting. Ready... Go! Cut. OK! That was good. It's good. Thank you. That's a wrap. Thank you very much. Good job. Thank you very much. Until next time. Excuse me. I'm sorry! Good job today. - I'll leave. - It's OK. Don't worry. - What? - Nothing. You have such a nice body, Yui... It sells. This shoot was your idea, right? Not Mr. Ishihara's. Well, it's complicated. Oh... That doesn't bother you, Mina? I wouldn't be able to take it. I'd never want a guy or a job taken by someone else. - Excuse me. - Oh, thanks for today. Thank you. You were great today, Yui. Really? It's so easy when the cameraman is Jiro. I wish it were always Jiro. It's so hot. The car is here. OK. That's fine. Thanks. Let's go for drinks sometime. - Bye, Mina. - Thanks so much. Good job. You, too. He comes home in the morning, even when there's no shoot. We haven't had sex in three weeks. He thinks he's so high and mighty. Getting mad at me just for having drinks with a guy. He's so selfish. Only nice when he wants to be. Well, that's men for you. As if you know anything about men. Don't lecture me. On. I get it. I guess you know all about Jiro. Right? I wish you'd told me what kind of guy he is. What? Apparently, Jiro has a new girlfriend. Did Jiro tell you that? He wouldn't tell me. He's sneaky like that. What are you going to do? No. Not my place. Absolutely not. Two or three days. No more than that. Can you hang this up? I thought you'd given that up. It's just a hobby. It takes patience. Here. It's nice, isn't it? But you're so impatient. How did you ever live with Jiro for 5 years? He seemed so sad after breaking up with you. Yeah, right. You still think I took him from you? Hey, was Jiro like this when you were living with him? He said you were adventurous in bed back then. Clean up your things. Maybe I'll tell Jiro tomorrow... that I'm pregnant. I'm kidding. It's just a joke! Bye. Oh, see you. Lock the door. Oh, you're home. This makes the room look so shabby. It looked like it was going to rain. Then don't do laundry. I'm borrowing your dress, Sis. You made this in school, right? I liked it. You opened my closet? How else could I get this? You're becoming like Mom, Sis. No I'm not. You look like her from behind. Oh? It's good. Oh, really? - Yeah. - Good. It's like Mom's. It's not that sweet. Hers is too sweet. You helped in the kitchen a lot. She made me help. I'm no good at cooking. Jiro and I always ate out. That reminds me. Mom once called saying you asked her to make lunch for a date. When? During high school. It was Kenichi. No, I think it was Ryo Onuki. No, that was in senior year. Hey. Hey. What? I think I am, after all. What? I haven't gotten my period. Since when? Last month. Are you sure? When was the last time I was with Jiro? That's not what I mean. Hey. Do you have one of those? What? A testing thing. Of course not. I guess you wouldn't. Did you tell Jiro? Is it really his? Of course. Should I tell Jiro I'm pregnant and make him marry me? It wouldn't work. How would you know? I guess I'll get rid of it. Quit joking and be serious. It's your fault, Sis. Why did you introduce us? He gets mad and hits me. He's only nice when he wants sex. It's your fault! Why did you introduce him to me? Shut up. Maybe you're the one... who wanted Jiro's baby? That's cute. Where did you get it? It was a gift. From who? "T" "T" for Takuya, right? So you're dating Takuya? Just keeping him. You haven't been sleeping, Ms. Katagiri? My sister's staying at my place. Sounds like fun. I hate having someone in my place. Oh, did you hear? Tomoko's buying a condo. Really? A three-room women's condo. Starting a loan early pays off, apparently. Didn't she just get a boyfriend? You can't rely on men these days. I should think about it. Young people are so mature these days. Where were you? I felt like going to Mom's. But... I imagined Mom's face, and got scared. I'm hungry- Can you make something? Want one? Yeah. Hey. I've been thinking. And, well... I can't decide. You'll have to. I know. Ow! Be careful! Ow. Something fell off. Oh, sorry. Hey, when we were little... Yikes! When it rained, we used to walk barefoot. Getting our feet all muddy. That was just you. Really? You almost got athlete's foot. Mom washed your feet with vinegar every night. I was jealous. What, of athlete's foot? You always take everything I treasure, Mina. I do? My pencil sharpener, my indoor slippers... The Mont Blanc fountain pen I got for college. It wasn't your pen I wanted. Then what was it? My sister's love. Weirdo. Come inside. I'm amazed you're able to show your face. I told you. I was working. Cold as ever. After everything he did for you, you won't even light incense. Mina. Light one for me. Incense. Stubborn! I found this when I was cleaning. The Yukata I wore when I was young. It's flashy. Really? Think it still fits? No way. You look good in bright colors, Mom. I wore this to summer festivals with your father. Dad loved folk dancing. Try it, Mina. Really? It looks good. A perfect fit. Your skin is so pretty and smooth. When did you get so sexy? It's yours, Mina. - Really? - Take it home. Before you end up married. He was always impatient. Always had to be the first to do everything. You don't mean that. Maybe he didn't want to bother me with his rehabilitation. Do you have pictures of my father? Of course not. He abandoned us and left. Your unpleasant personality must come from his genes. Mina inherited her father's charms. That's why she's bad with men, but has a kind heart. Let's drop it... No. Some daughter, who can't even show up for the funeral! Let her get it out. You too, Sis? I pull and pull, but they grow right back. Just like you two. How old are you now, Hiroko? You don't remember your own daughter's age? 34. Almost 35. You'll have to give in soon. To what? I wonder when I'll get to see my grandchildren? As if you'd want to be called Grandma. Hey, Mom? What is it? Do you know... Why I would never call him "Dad"? Everyone's a saint once they die. Living... as if nothing had ever happened... It's hard. It's ready! This looks great. Not like in Tokyo. Put that down and eat this. I'm going to head home. Already? You're spending the night, right? Yeah. Bye, Mom. Hey...? It's Katagiri, isn't it? I knew it! Remember Shimizu from the baseball team? Shut up. Don't be embarrassed. This is Shimizu's first girlfriend. - For real? - It wasn't like that. This takes me back. We're going for drinks. Want to come? I have to get back to Tokyo. Come on, just one. You had a good thing going. I didn't do anything with her. Or you tried to force her, and failed? No! Apparently, Shimizu couldn't get it up. Why would I want to fuck her? Ow. Do you mind if I smoke? Go ahead. If you'd like. I don't smoke. Then, I won't either. No, go ahead. Well then... Do you come here often? Yes. So do I. I like your shoes. Do you know what a person's shoes say about their personality? If the soles are worn at the toe, they're impatient. Want to see? I barely have any sole left. Impatient, that's me. Excuse me. Can you keep it down? Are you all right? Ow. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. I just felt faint. Water. You got me? How embarrassing. Your water. Thank you. Wait. I'm going to take a shower. She's already got a man. Mom, I mean. How long has Dad been dead? It's embarrassing. Hey, the guy? He's the funeral salesman. And get this... She met him when she was working at the retirement home. Then they got together again at Dad's funeral. They've definitely done it once. I mean, she didn't get him anything to sit on. He was squirming on his butt. Then he got a cushion out for himself. He sat in the corner, listening to us and laughing. Gross! That's the mood of a couple who've spent a night together. Are you sure? Positive. Mom will live long. This is tiny. I'm so full. You ate too much. When was the last time we ate together? When you started working, I think. Really? That long ago? I think so. Right! And Jiro was with... Let's take a detour! Sis? What is it? I've made up my mind. About what? I'll have it. Back home. Watching Mom, I think I can do it. What about work? You're just starting out. I know! You could direct commercials, even with a baby. Nope. No way! I'm disposable! Right? And Jiro's getting popular in the same industry. What are you going to do back home? I'll work at the retirement home where Mom used to. You can't, Mina. Yes I can. I will. I've made up my mind. I didn't have too many good times in Tokyo. You're really going home today? That's right. Oh, yeah... I forgot about this. It's OK. Keep it. - Really? - Yes. You want me to pick up guys back home with this? You're really sure? Unlike you, I act fast after I make a decision. You're going to be late. See you later. Bye. Take care. Yes? Yes? Is Mr. Ishida at home? And who are you? I have to speak with him. He's shooting on location. I see. Are you his girlfriend? No. You don't have to hide it. I don't care if Jiro has a girlfriend. I'm not. Then who are you? My younger sister is pregnant with Jiro's child. And... She's going back home alone to have the baby. SQ? Mina's a little strange. Letting a baby change her life. She shouldn't have come to Tokyo. Date some guy back home... Stan a happy family. Instead of Jiro. What is it you think... that you understand? If it weren't for Jiro's baby, She wouldn't have to give up what she wanted. If she really wanted to keep working, she'd have an abortion. I would. That's the way it is. This is fine. Here, for Mom. Should I come with you to Shinagawa? It's OK. Don't look at me like that. Bye. We're just starting out. It's been a while since our last Group Date, hasn't it? What? But the last one was less than two weeks back. - Really? - Yeah. You're something! If we don't have at least one per week, it's like... - we haven't had any at all. - You're addicted to it! Yeah... Group Dating addiction. Tomoko's in charge tonight? Is it going to be good, Tomoko? Leave it to me. They're all great. Are you sure about that? You always take the best ones. We'll get you back for last time. Go ahead. Take home whoever you want. - You make it sound so easy! - Seriously. What are we eating? - Thinking of your stomach already? - Ms. Katagiri? Let's go, Hiroko. English translation by 'unknown' (many thanks whoever you are) Subtitle timing, editing and additions for this version by famitsu1.
