THIS FILM WAS MADE IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY, WITH THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE TALENT OF MANY PEOPLE. ON JULY 14, 2013 AMARILDO DIAS DE SOUZA (43 YEARS) WAS TORTURED TILL DEATH BY MILITARY POLICEMEN OF THE ROCINHA FAVELA IN RIO DE JANEIRO. THAT STORY HAS BECOME A SYMBOL OF THE FIGHT OF THE SOCIETY AGAINST THE STATE VIOLENCE. Attention all Rocinha UPP callsigns... All Rocinha UPP callsigns. SARC in operation. 9030 AREP ?pia... Inform...

We now have an emergency situation: your husband's disappearance. And the demonstration you are doing here. I won't negotiate anything with the Major. You will tell what to negotiate, what to do, what your conditions are. Imagine if you sat at a table with the Government, what is it that you demand? There is much we remember. It's hard to forget. The good things that happened, the bad things. The most recent memories, I think I was about 4. I can remember a few things. Our house had wattle and daub walls. It was mud, with a bamboo and wooden frame. Every storm we had and the first thing I felt, already aged 5 or 6, was a strong tummy ache. When the first thunder sounded, and the heavy rain. Because I knew then that a tragedy could happen. And then my father managed to buy a house. Right next to my granny's place. Because there is a strong family thing here. Everybody builds close by, all together, helping each other. Neighbors, relatives, everyone together carrying the building materials, sand, stone, cement. All the floods we had and that nowadays people have to save their things from the rain, in our time we had to save the entire house in every rain. So, this will to fight collectively to avoid losing everything led us to really see what a community is. Those who were kids, who was teenager in the slum in the 1980s learned the meaning of the word community. Before they made this tunnel here, before the huge urban growth in the south side the city of Rio de Janeiro ended in Leblon. Rocinha was off the city plan. That's why we're here. We were disregarded by the government in that place no one goes to. The problem was that the city continued on growing. And Rocinha is in the most expensive square meter in Brazil, between S?o Conrado and Leblon. This is good for Rocinha because the job market we have. Crossing the tunnel we have the whole south zone of the city. To look after cars, carry bags for the ladies, to work as doormen, waiters, chefs, maids, cleaners, nannies. This also helped the community to grow. My granny used to say that her employer wanted to help her. "Tell me what you need to improve your house". "Tell what you need to build another floor". So I heard this a lot when I was a teenager. The employer helping the employee. The slum cannot be seen as a problem. The slum was a solution. Solution of a non-housing plan from this Government that received everyone to build the Rio-Niteroi bridge, the Avenida Brasil, the Aterro do Flamengo and there was no plan. A plan like "these people will have kids, and where are they going to study?" Where will everyone be able to live? This plan was not made. Well, leave them up there in the shacks that they'll get tired of so much toiling and will go back to the Northeast. But this never happened. At age 12 I was working in the open market, carrying fruit and vegetables in bags for the ladies. Selling garlic, lemons. That's how I could help my mother. And I grew up being beaten by the police. Getting my ass kicked by the police. And I don't see all this project that is being implemented by the Government as a solution to our problems. We also have, historically, and that is also a disaster, an entire punishing system that try to control these populations. As if the problem of criminality in Rio de Janeiro from the 1930s to these days was solely the responsibility of the slum populations. And this is not true. The Pacifying Police Unit was launched in Rocinha. One hundred security cameras... More security today for the nearly 100 thousand dwellers of Rocinha... The arrival of the pacifying forces mobilized 3,000 men... The implementation of UPP brings hope of better days... The Security Secretary talks about making history... This is the making of history... Tens of escape routes in a thick Atlantic forest area. The air space in Rocinha will be closed on Sunday for the Police to occupy... One place less to the Police to bleed... And the PM commander summons: shall we succeed? The new monitoring room linked to the Police computers will facilitate the identification of suspects... The 70,000 dwellers were free from the grip of the drug dealers. The camera circuit will also be used to watch the community. Since Rocinha was occupied by the Police... at least 5 people were shot in 12 hours of intense confrontation. I'm talking about the pacified Rocinha. Fear rules and we don't know who the next victim will be, how many more people will be assassinated, killed. To avoid confrontations that has been happening, to avoid new cases like Amarildo... Bullets are fired by drug dealers and policemen, and the 99% are in the cross fire. This won't solve the trafficking issue here, nor in Alem?o, Manguinhos and in none of the pacified communities. - Duda, tell me your full name. - Carlos Eduardo da Silva Barbosa... I was surprised when one of the witnesses said she heard the policemen behind my house saying: "Leave it out. He will disappear just like Amarildo." And I was really shaken. It's panic, panic. My daughter cries all the time when I go out. My wife is worried, she's so much afraid, thinking they will revenge and try to do something against my life. My mum, I see her waning away, every day. Psychologically she is scared and she cries so much. It's a life I don't wish to anyone. I believe we don't need another case like Amarildo anywhere. This doesn't have to happen in no slum. I think we need dwellers who complain and press charges. Right. Thank you, Claudia. Bye. Bye. - Who was it, Duda? - Brazil News. She called to hear me on what happened on Friday. Said she followed up the news and wanted me to clarify all the details and facts about the last Police stoppages. Another one. This week all the media came to asked me what is going on here. We'll see, right? Let's see! The kids used to see the Police as a security. You can't say that today. The kids are afraid. Afraid of leaving home, walking on the alleys. Why? Because there is violence, there is no respect with us dwellers in the slum. When they slapped me on the face, I fell to the ground, all dizzy. My chest was swollen, my face was cut. They lit a lighter next to me. They arrived at my house and used pepper spray on the small bathroom window. There was no ventilation, only two very small windows, one in the kitchen and another in the bathroom. They spread pepper spray through the window and we had to leave the house. And they asked: why are you running? Where are you going? And they laughed at us. There were weekends in which I'd take my wife out to chill out. They said we could go nowhere and locked us to my front door. It was as if I had been arrested. I couldn't leave the place. If they found me in the street, they would beat me up or take me into a corner to torture me. Because last time they tried to place a bag on my head. I thought that... Choking me... I thought they were going to kill me. I went to the 2nd street, in my area. I didn't want to, but I had to. A girl filmed it. I didn't know her then, but now I do. She said: Adriana, I was on my balcony, I saw it. I was taking a picture of my daughter and saw it when it happened. He was sitting on a motorcycle with two phones, moving songs from one to the other. When this PM turned and said: Freeze! When he said 'my papers are here' and reached for his pocket the policemen yelled "too late!" and shot Jonathan. He fell down, when they took his phone they yelled: "Fuck". Sorry about the language. "We screwed it, we got the wrong boy, but now it's too late.? When they looked up, they saw she was there. They broke into the house, took her phone, broke the memory card and her phone. So, it's... She went to the police station, made a statement, told the chief inspector, but nothing happened till now. The meaning of Police in the community is fear. in one of the police incursions here in the street, the alley where I live, the Major, the Commander himself, made a point of saying it to my face, in front of my family, that he would get me. That I was been noticed. Then the officers who were there with him, from the tactical group he created, started to threaten me, too. Some of the police officers already knew me, from my snack bar. And even they seeing me working, they insisted in with the threats. The policeman broke into my home, pointed an assault rifle to my 15-year-old daughter. Forced her to leave the house, yelling, asking if there were any more people in the house. My wife was coming out of the bathroom and was also threatened. They broke into their home, placed a gun to his face. And the other one said: "kill him. Kill him now!" And my grandson said: "mum, granny, they are going to kill Duda!" Then I said: "no, Christian, slow down. They are not going to do it". I asked if that policeman who broke into my place had a search warrant. And they started to scorn. They started to say I was an intellectual, that I was a "smarty". Just because I had mentioned my rights. I even asked him that since he was a representative of the law, shouldn't he be the one to make sure my rights were respected. When they started to actually ask me about weapons an assault rifles, saying they already knew I was responsible for the weapons, that I stashed the rifles of the drug dealers, I realized my life was at risk. And since I had already witnessed several torture sessions and many police actions involving bribery and filthy stuff. I realized that I could become a victim at any moment. I could become a victim of torture or they could making me disappear. So I had no doubt. I had to denounce or wait for the worse to happen to me. On the 29th a bullet was fired by a policeman into my place, through the window and crossed my daughter's bedroom. I placed myself in the line of fire and asked the police to stop because the alleys are very narrow where we live and the houses are full of holes. The policemen are firing without looking. These policemen started to yell from the end of the alley, calling me out, aiming their rifles at me, telling me to walk towards them. I refused to go. I told them I was in my home and would not go out where it was dark. The Human Rights Commission is inside the Legislative Branch, helping the public. Helping them with legal advice, social advice and taking on the charges. They didn't even search me, just told me to place my hands on the wall and beat me. The policemen who caught me there, who searched me, they told him: "tell that man there, the big white one, that if we catch him alone in the alley, we'll hurt him because he's very cheeky, very full of himself." I'm quite proud of taking individual cases and turning them into collective actions. We organize in such a way that the individual doesn't feel alone. So you call me to tell how it was with M?rcio. The feedback it's important. Thank you guys. What's up, Boi? Take the cement here. I was coming from the market, after buying things we needed at home and I passed by the policemen who stopped Amarildo. Some of them with ninja hats, that tactical group. I felt worried because that weekend the UPP Police and Civil Police did a major operation. THE ARMED PEACE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT ON JUNE 12 AND 13, 2013 BY THE CIVIL AND MILITARY POLICE FORCES It had been 2 days since the start of the 'Armed Peace' Operation, which didn't produce the expected result. It wasn't a successful operation. This lack of satisfaction leads the Major to order them to bring Amarildo in to have him talk about weapons and drugs. My neighbor came and said: "Beth, the Police have arrested and taken Amarildo." I asked: "Why? He just came back from fishing?" She replied: "Go after them." I was wearing shorts, put a jacket on and went running after them. It's just a few meters from my place to the UPP and I no longer saw my husband. They really rushed my husband away. When I got there, I asked the policemen where my husband was. They said Amarildo was there because they have some questions to ask him and would release him. I said I would not leave until they release my husband. And I remained there, waiting for my husband. Then, a VW Gol stopped in front of the UPP and the policemen took my husband from there, in handcuffs. I asked where they were taking my husband. They said they'd take him but he'd no quarrel with the Justice and we'd let him go. Before my husband went into the car, he told me his documents were with the policeman. Another policeman standing next to the car threatened my husband again. This policeman came to me and my 13-year-old daughter and said the Major had phoned them and told no one was allowed to go up. Because there were 20 people being held up for questioning and they couldn't talk to anyone. Later on, in the evening, Beth came to me, desperate, crying, saying that the policemen had taken Amarildo and he hadn't come back yet. I tried to calm her down saying to keep clam, they took Amarildo but they would've to let him go because Amarildo was no criminal. I went after him, but I was like: "Amarildo disappear." Then I went to the police station, to the morgue, I went to every place in Rio looking for him and nothing, nothing at all. The other day we went back to the UPP. They said they let him go and that he should be in some relative's place. I told them I have lived with my husband for 30 years. I know the ways he takes. He goes from home to work, he wasn't fond of music groups or dances. My husband's only vice was fishing and bringing fish home. And my husband is missing. He wouldn't go to a relative's place, not even when we fought. When she said he wasn't in the police station neither hospital, then went back to the UPP with her family and the Major said he'd let him go, 'cause he was clean and that he had already gone home, then I started to worry and be certain that something really serious had happened to him. Then I said, wait a minute, I will start to talk. Rio is frightened with a riot in front of the Rocinha slum, the largest in Latin America. The main route between the south and west is blocked by football and drumming. That moment was well printed in my mind because an uncle of mine was in that riot. But soon the drumming changes into a huge confusion. The traffic comes to a halt and the police start to act. I wanted somehow that the community could come together again. I missed the community together again, united to complain or demand. The main entrance of Rocinha turns into a battle field. To try and rescue that union in the community of Rocinha. Because Amarildo was one of ours. And we decided that couldn't go unpunished. Hundreds of Rocinha dwellers demonstrated on Thursday evening, demanding explanations on the disappearance of assistant mason Amarildo de Souza, missing since the 14th of July. The presence of major Edson at the demonstration was a request from the dwellers. They wanted him to explain what had happened to Amarildo, since he was the head of the UPP. And who had taken Amarildo from his home were the UPP policemen. I told him we would only clear the roads with the presence of the chairman of the Human Rights Commission. The crowd blocked the Lagoa-Barra motorway for some 2 hours... After a few minutes the Major notified me that someone from the Human Rights would come. The people were blocking the road at the exit of the tunnel. I'm not mistaken, the major is a militia man. The first contact with the demonstrators, with the family, with Duda, was a little complicated due to the lack of information. People mix Government with the State and in that case I was representing a team from a parliament commission that is part of the State but that is not Government. The role of this parliament commission is to inspect and demand from the Government. - Calm down. Just the family. - My name is Guilherme. Beth! Just Beth. Just Beth. Just the family. Look, my name's Guilherme, I'm not from the Government, - I have no Government authority. - Right. I'm with the Human Rights Commission. At first people treated much like Government. They made demands, and then Duda came up and said "I?ve been there, I've pressed charges, I'd already spoken about these practices." Guilherme, this isn't the first case. Others have happened since the occupation. Families that live here are afraid of charging, a husband was murdered, too. Planted a gun and drugs and said the man was a drug dealer. - This's common. It happens all the time. - They do this with anyone. Two youngsters were kidnapped in their home, they forged a possession and arrested them. There are people imprisoned who are not drug dealers. We need people here to help us. The Major, he militarized the community. He does whatever he wants and his men too. They have no limits. The policemen kill on his orders. We can't change from a community ruled by the drug dealers to a community occupied by the militia. Because what they're doing here is the work of militia, thrashing the lives of workers, arresting innocent people. I'm waiting for two things: get arrested or get killed. Do you know why? 'Cause I went there to press charges. - I went there to press charges. - You do have to press charges. But who is going to protect me? It was awful the number of other cases and people who came forward to speak out. People are scared to talk, they don't believe it can produce anything. And they absorb their own pain. No matter how big it's. But that was a moment of catharsis, when the whole favela had come down because of one man's disappearance and it was a moment to breathe, a flash of hope that something could be done. I think it triggered other people to speak out. You can even kill me, but I have 20 thousand more behind me. It was a storm of tragedies that took place there while I tried to explain my role, and tried to open a channel to negotiate. - For as long as we get no response... - I will talk to the Major now. We'll have the chance to sit down and negotiate. We want the dwellers to come along and negotiate, too. I'm not negotiating anything with the Major. - Ok. - Please, let me finish this. I'm not negotiating anything with the Major. I'll tell him we can sit down everybody to negotiate. You'll negotiate what to do and what the conditions are. You are the ones who live here. I'm here to open this channel. Just to open the channel. Consider this: if you sat now at a table with the Government, what is it that you want? Think about It, I need that answer. Then I said we first wanted to talk to the top officials in public security. I wanted to talk to Jos? Mariano Beltrame. There was no use talking with soldiers. We wanted to talk to their boss. in the mean time, we opened half of the street, since the dialogue had begun. But we enforce that would block the street again in 10 minutes until we have an official position. And so it really came. Tomorrow at 10AM, in the State Security Secretary will be present: the State Security Chief, Beltrame, the Civil Police chief, who at the time was Martha Rocha, the head police chief at the 15th precinct, chief Orlando Zaccone, the chief commander of the UPPs... and the Major Edson, who was not mentioned during the negotiation, also show up in the meeting. I did not hesitate. I asked permission to Amarildo's family. As I thought that meeting was for them to speak out, was more important they talk about the tragedy. But I was at that moment in most absolute perplexity. I had to talk to Mr. Beltrame, to chief Martha Rocha, to Mr. Zaccone and to the UPP coordinator that a corrupt man was present there. There was a man who always threatened my physical integrity. And I spoke about his stance, attitude and omission regarding the community. And I went further, I also revealed what he did with the money of the moto-taxis. The money from the sponsor company to make improvements to the moto-taxi business, that money was going to his pocket. This was revealed there, during that meeting. Major Edson is an UPF representative. And he was a very powerful man. We were very impressed with it. Although all the evidences, we could not have him removed from his position, at least. Taken from that place from where he could harass the witnesses, as everyone knows. He had support from State representatives. Rio de Janeiro representatives with connections in Rocinha and representatives who had an interest in the continuation of that arrangement. I felt an enormous concern of the authorities not to tarnish that political project. I felt it was... very political issue, not one of justice. There was no will to really investigate those charges, those facts. Just like when I pressed charges in April and... The Government knew about the torturing and threats that Amarildo's family was suffering since April. IN JULY, THE CASE OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF AMARILDO BECOMES AN INQUIRY AT THE 15TH CIVIL POLICE STATION. The period I was in charge of the inquiry was the initial period of 15 days. It was too short. I'd a general idea of the situation, what was being presented and some of the questions that were made. The first one was regarding the cameras at the UPP building, that were switched off. So, we had images of Amarildo going into the police car and going towards the UPP building. But we had no images of his getting off at the UPP due to this off camera. So, there was only the statement of the UPP Commander who said he was there when Amarildo arrived at the UPP and that after checking his papers, because they took his working papers there, he verified Amarildo had no arrest warrant pending and let him go. He also said he saw Amarildo going down the stairs that face the UPP container. But at the end of this staircase there was another camera that was not off and Amarildo didn't appear leaving by the stairs. AFTER 15 DAYS INTO THE INQUIRY, THE CASE IS TRANSFERRED TO THE HOMICIDES POLICE STATION. The police started on a line of inquiry that was totally wrong and prejudiced. The prejudice was to criminalize the victim to justify these measures, the barbarism. If he is a drug dealer he can be killed by the police the way he was. During the 15 days I was at the head of the inquiry the only questions the press and even the people in my social environment even family members, friends... they asked me whether Amarildo was a drug dealer or not. We can't conclude whether there was a homicide or not, if there was a torture or not due to the fact that a person, in this case, the alleged victim is a drug dealer. The "Extra" newspaper published an article on the possible involvement of Amarildo and his wife with the drug traffic. Amarildo, as well as many other members of the organization, he was responsible for storing materials, drugs, for the traffic. The report concluded at the beginning of the week, Ruchester Marreiros came to request the temporary detention of Elizabete Gomes da Silva. The police chief said he only found the involvement of the couple after the disappearance of Amarildo. The head of the G?vea Police Station, Orlando Zaccone, recorded yesterday an interview in Piau?, and explained why he decided not to request the detaining of Elizabete. After observing the data collected by chief Ruchester, I found no evidence attached to the inquiry to justify the detaining of many people, including Beth, wife of the missing person, Amarildo. There were no elements capable to evidence that the Beth mentioned in a statement given by a policeman was the Elizabete 'cause there was no recognition evidence that they were the same person. Orlando Zaconne also questions another conclusion of the assistant chief. That Amarildo's house would be an escape route for drug dealers. He probably does not know Amarildo's house, which has 10 square meters and has no window through which to escape. A house of very poor people who lived where drug trafficking was happening. My report included this evidences rejecting them. Since I cannot go along with the idea that people who live near or next to the drug traffic, anywhere in this country, are drug dealers just because they live in poor places. Where is Amarildo? Mr. President, on the Amarildo case, there are many indications that the drug dealers have disappeared with him. If Amarildo were not missing, he would have to be in prison. The one taking the blame now is the poor military police officer who has nothing to do with it and that is being accused of vanish with Amarildo's corpse. And now they are sleeping thanks to prescription pills, with this sword dangling over their heads, with this rotten finger of some people, pointing at them, as if they were to blame. I deeply regret this case is being exploited by some state representatives. in a time of pain they use this to gain advantages. There is a fantasy that the drug dealer is someone who has to be exterminated. The so-called drug dealer, slum dweller, he is built and materialized into this enemy number one. All the dead are drug dealers. All the dead have a connection with the traffic. We don't de-constructed until today the perspective of war, of confrontation. And as a result of the confrontation, the extermination. We are choosing people to die and after they are dead they instantly become drug dealers. They are immediately branded as drug dealers. Because the drug dealer has been stripped of his humanity. So killing a drug dealer is no crime. It's not a human fact. We haven't understood yet that he who kills a criminal is a criminal. We told the police that if they follow on this path they would commit one more crime, because the trafficking has absolutely no connection with it. They also try to fabricate evidence with witnesses taken by those involved. By Major Edson, who is one of the main accused parties and by another policeman also accused. They take witnesses that saw and heard some drug dealers saying that they had eliminated Amarildo after he left the main UPP building. This farce was quickly dismantled. A witness saw Amarildo's body covered by a plastic, being tortured and asking for help. This witness never wanted to give a statement and this is understandable. With a police that keeps threatening the witnesses, planting witnesses. How are you going to make a statement to help the inquiry? It was the procedural fraud practiced that enable to prove what they did. The conversations between the alleged drug dealers who we now know weren't drug dealers but agents of the State pretending to be drug dealers and assuming the disappearance of Amarildo. A man who identifies himself as the drug dealer named Catatau makes threats to a policeman infiltrated in the traffic and suggests he killed Amarildo, who went by the alias Boi. Expert examination showed that this man was police officer Marlon staging a farce. You rat, I'll cut your head off, do you hear? My friend, my friend... Let me explain to you, Boi is on you, already! So what we have is a set of procedural fraud which was not very well explained, either. The conversations between State agents. We have in Rio de Janeiro, The Guardian, that tapes everyone, this device should be audited for us to find out who talked to whom in this period. Who in the Government talked to whom? And then we would know what problem isn't in the order of the Rocinha UPP, the Commander and his subordinates. This would show us the MO of the State in these occurrences. The State also cared to preserve the person of Major Edson. in such way that he was never dismissed. He went on vacation. When came to the conclusion, days before he was formally charged with the death of Amarildo he had gone on vacation. He wasn't removed from his post. If we look at it, from the disappearance of Amarildo on the 14th of July until the two following months. The entire government had the version not official. The media insisted on it until they could no longer deny. The Judiciary branch, the Prosecutor's Office step aside without going into the question and it almost came to the point that the fantasy version that incriminated the victim, Amarildo, prevailed. We got to the conclusion, that some of the police officers were responsible for the death of Amarildo. Torture and death of Amarildo. What happened was a barbaric action that took place there. I'm a worker. Any vagrant will say he is a worker. Every bastard vagrant I took down said he was a worker. Now you're a worker in that shitty place? What sort of worker, son? Only been a drug dealer. Pay attention. You are fucked already. Do you want your wife to be fucked too? Your child to be fucked too? 'Cause that's what I'm going to do, Boi. This "I'm a worker" talk is rubbish. Fuck off! My wife, my wife is honest. - Boi, you've been snitched. - It's nothing like that. You know the dirty things that happen there. No, it's only honest people in my place. My children, my wife, we've nothing to do with it. All friends with the criminals in this shitty place. - Do you want me to take your son in? - You know me! I'm going to forge it and bust your son. I'll bring him in and beat the crap out of him like I'm doing with you. - You know me! - Is this what you want? - Give us the fucking guns! - There are no guns! You're stashing them guns for the men. Who lives in that house cannot work for any criminal act. - Only honest stuff. - But you are stupid. You're stashing them guns because of the powder for your old lady. My wife is decent. My wife is a mother of a family. You mean your wife is a family mother? She is a whore. A real whore. Sniffer, she is a real slut. Keeps putting her big nose on the powder. Whore my ass. Do not talk about my family. - Keep your voice down. - Don't talk about my family. Just offering her old pussy around... Do not talk about my wife, you bastard! - Why are you all steamed up? - I'm not steamed up. You're fucked! - You're fucked! - Leave alone! No more dirty business in that shitty place. Dirty business is what you are doing to me now. You stash the guns for the drug dealers who sniff powder and fuck your woman and I'm the one fucking around? Do not talk about my wife. - Your wife is a whore, son. - My wife is no whore! - Do not talk about my wife! - And keep your voice down. Do you want to die? Give me them fucking guns! Damn it! Where are the guns, you bum? Where are the guns, mother fucker? Where are the guns, mother fucker? - You vagrant. - There is no fucking gun. Where are the guns, mother fucker? Wake up. Wake up, you bum. Talk now, mother fucker. Where are the guns? It's over, Boi. It's over! You fucked, Boi! - It's over, Medeiros. - Shit, this is going to stink, Major. No, it's not. Clean this shit and lose the body. Amarildo, I can say with an open heart, with a clean soul. Being the person he was on a very day basis, he was always working on something. He was glad to work. It was the same thing with helping people. I always saw Amarildo carrying a sofa, a fridge, carrying building materials for other people. I saw him taking a neighbor who was ill to the hospital. They managed to do something bad, something really bad to such a good person. Torture always existed in this country, always. But it gets improved in the civil military dictatorship. At that time it was against thoughts, against ideas. And we inherited this. The Police inherited this. This practice was widespread, it goes for everyone. But today it essentially affects the poorer level. With the military dictatorship, the Police, mainly the Military Police, gains much relevance. Their numbers raised and they gain these powers on the fringe of legality. BOPE, for example, was created by a colonel linked to the dungeons of the dictatorship in 1978. So we have a relation of these paramilitary groups or "para-official", the military dictatorship, the military police and the terror model implemented during the dictatorship, that was not dismantled with the re-democratization of the country. Still today, we still have this interface between a Police State, the punitive State and the State of exception. In a State with the rule of law, the State is limited by the Law. But in a Police State everything is allowed. In a Police State, the State no longer is a representation of civil society or of a politically organized society. Therefore the State with their apparatus becomes the enemy of society. And through force or brutality, it seeks not to be legitimized, but it seeks affirmation through terror. No violence! The violence on the 20th was very intense. The police truly had no skill at all to deal with that kind of event. So, many people were wounded, constitutional rights were violated in series. The population was a hostage of the Police training which at that time was none. Resist, resist, resist! Bastards! Cowards! Cowards! Stay! Its a civil war, fucker! And one demonstration after the other, the violence got worse. That was a remarkable characteristic. From aggressions with no grounds at all to arrests with no justification. Revolution! No matter the reason, police violence has always been disproportional. So the feeling the population has is that when it relates to the State, the State rejects it, then it protests and then it gets beaten up. And in a police State the power is not with the Police alone. Other Justice agencies, they start to act also with the same police logic and they coordinate themselves within the State. So we get a repressive State structure within the structure of the State. The Police that started to repress the demonstrations is the same that always trained up on the favelas. Breaking in, kicking walls, slapping faces, killing people. That is the Police that got trained. And the middle class always said it was allowed because that Police "are protecting us". But they started to go to the demonstrations and no longer protected the middle class. All the violence people went through during the demonstrations. All the brutality, all the incompetence of the Police, the media were there, filming it. But in the communities here, it's a rare thing, one in a million. When one has the courage to point a camera and record a police action like this. At this point, Amarildo comes up as an icon. As a symbol of people's feelings regarding this landmark of police brutality. And this spreads around the world. It didn't move only Rio de Janeiro. Where is Amarildo? Police, where is Amarildo? Police, where is Amarildo? The Amarildo case attracted attention because after a long time without a strong demonstration, the slum came down so strongly and served as a trigger in other people and other slums. This was very important. #WHEREISAMARILDO? The police after 2007, told, without any doubt, by their commanders, started to change its behavior and started to make people disappear. So, we believe the Police today disappears with the people it kills. Because doing that, there is no inquiry. People, let's round up, please. Let's block the street. Death is a very hard thing, but the disappearance deepens the loss because you have not buried anyone, you cannot grieve, you didn't say goodbye. We are here because we are sad, because our Pacifying Police Unit dragged my uncle from his family. That's enough. It's not because we are poor, and live in a poor community. that we will be victims of the State. There's a say in Brazil that goes: "go after your rights". But I think that it?s not correct. Because you've to go after the right you don't yet have. The right you have you don't have to go after. It already exists. A right is not to be begged for, it's to be demanded. The Military Police in the State of Rio cannot arrive at the slum with a free pass to do whatever it wants. And that's it! Many times the policeman told me about what the internal police rules ask me... No way. Your internal rules don't ask me anything because I'm no policeman. You are the policemen. With the excuse that Rocinha is a cartel, they made Rocinha into a head quarter. Where everyone inside the favela is a private, getting orders from any soldier. Freeze, mother fucker! Freeze, you bastard! What? Is this the right way to talk to me? Amarildo's smile we'll never see that again. Amarildo's face we'll never see that again. The only thing left to the family was grief and sadness. There is a concept of public security that emphasizes and keeps these two perspectives: that of war and that of the enemy. And with a massively punitive control, brutal and unlimited. They gave a free pass to the Police do what they want in the slum. Because that is what the UPP is all about. The UPP is the Al-5 of the slums in Rio. How was the DOPS called? The political Police. What is an UPP? The same thing. It's only the year that changes. The torture is the same, the disappearances are the same. in the past it was the white university student that was hunted down. Now it's the children of black people and of north-easterners who live in the slum. The governor won't show up on national TV to speak: "I've come to promote the control of the poor, through guns, rifles, and soldiers." He will say he is fighting the enemy. That he is fighting the drug traffic. That he is promoting the good. That the State is now coming in. But when you search for information, you'll see that before the UPP the Government did work in the slums, especially in election years. The Government inaugurated PAC and build the cable car in Alem?o. So what are they talking about when they say the State is coming in now? This is a lie. What is going on now is a greater militarization of the slums and the areas around them. The media plays a major role in this. And Brazilian media is becoming conservative and not analytical at all. Every day TV tells us that shots were exchanged in a pacified area. Either the area is pacified or there is a shootout. There is a short-circuit in critical reasoning that would state: "Look, it did not pacify it. It did not happen". Because shootout and deaths on both sides is an absence of peace. There is this huge problem in there, right? And the Brazilian media refuses to reflect upon it in a decisive way. If people try to learn what has been going on in the city, they will see that the Amarildo case was not the problem of the soldier who arrested, tortured and killed a person. What happened to Amarildo is a public security issue. The UPP would only work if it were a Public Policy Unit where the Police would be part of the project. The Police being the project will never work neither in Rocinha nor in any slum and in no country either. The Police cannot be the project of any place. With all the consideration you have shown the family, we will ask you to do this peacefully because this is our fight. They've already destroyed our family and we won't let them destroy our dignity. We're a dignified family and we're among dignified friends, so we'll walk in and do our demonstration, say our prayers and then we will all leave peacefully, holding hands, always struggling for our rights because this is enough. A State that spends billions buying armaments, increasing the numbers of the police force, with Robocop armored suits, repressing the demonstrations, armored cars, armored helicopters, assault rifles, spy robots, so much money to control and where is the advanced post of the Department of Culture in Rocinha? Where is the advanced post of the Department of Social Services and Human Rights in Rocinha? Where is the advanced post of the Department of Work and Income in Rocinha? There is none, but the UPP is there. Full of assault rifles and ammunition to exercise social control. A large share of the society and the authorities are not worried about it. They think the social issue can be managed from a police perspective. But the social problem is no police matter. If all the dwellers had gone with me, if all the people who were suffering. If all the communities that are experiencing this organize themselves, unite to seek their rights, not submitting. How many Amarildos died without culprits? How many people died in Rocinha, in Alem?o, Tabajaras, Chap?u Mangueira, Vidigal. In which community its youth is not being tortured and murdered? They abandon for over 4 decades those who live in communities, and now they say that public security is what we need. Imagine those who live in slums more and more organized and even more assuming their roles, masters of their own lives. The Amarildo case was the trigger for people from the slums, for those from the asphalt. Everybody should understand that we are the power. The response to this is a network amongst the slums, a network for people in a city who question this militarization model. People who live in the slum has this Gabriela syndrome. All Brazilian does, too. I was born like this, I grew up like this, I'll live like this and I'll die like this... No! We might even fail, man. But the next generation will not go through what we've endured. We can change it for the next generation. We will go to every place to create this network. To strengthen this link that is ours, it belongs to the society. Man, I was... looking at the kids talking one of these days, it's the end of the year and they have this tradition to dye their hair. New Year's Eve with hair dyed. And they were saying they wouldn't dye their hair this year. And I asked them why not. And they said if the policemen grab them, they will beat them up. Last year policemen said they were all criminals because they'd all dyed their hair yellow. And then I said I would dye my hair too and if the police beat them up they will have to get me too and we'll all go to jail together. They all got excited and everyone started to dye their hair. I said: "If I do it, will you all do it, too?" They said: "We'll do it." Everyone started to dye their hair, I had to buy the dye, hydrogen peroxide for everyone. I even paid for them to have their hair dyed as everyone joined in. Breno... All the kids around here, Breno is there. My next door neighbor. Paula's son. Everyone with their hair dyed blonde. We'll go through the New Year all dyed yellow, all right. A community that lives at ease, with more freedom will have more to gain. Since some paths to happiness are peace, culture and leisure. A community that is cornered, beaten up from all sides, moves away from such hope and its youngsters grow up in rebellion. We can't fight organized crime by sending in the armored cars into the alleys. It will only produce more anger in the people who live in the slum. I live in the slum and I demand respect, it's only my rights that I'm asking here. Kicking doors without a warrant, this must be punished, it cannot be. It's all wrong, it's even hard to explain. But the way things are going, it's way past the breaking point. It's all wrong, it's also hard to understand. There are people sowing evil and wishing to reap good. Jobless mothers, children out of school, that is the cycle we see in this place. It's thousands of stories that are basically the same, you can see. I honestly can't see how this cycle would stop, but the way they are treating us only helps this evil to spread. Police dying, criminals dying, and a second after another one takes the place of the dead one, and no one cares, to make it worse. Now, my friend, it's all up to you, just a warning to finish this. The future of the slum depends on the fruit you choose to plant. Yes, it's all wrong. It's even hard to explain. But the way things are going, it's way past the breaking point. It's all wrong and also hard to understand. The Government sows evil and wants to harvest good. That's it. UNTIL THE FINISHING OF THIS FILM (JULY 2014), MAJOR EDSON AND 24 OTHER POLICE OFFICERS STILL FACED CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR THE TORTURE AND DEATH OF AMARILDO.
