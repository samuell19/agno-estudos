MAX'S FATHER: What money? You lent him money? MAX'S MOTHER: Bill, take off your scarf. MAX'S FATHER: You should watch your money more carefully. A man shouldn't borrow. Money is hard to get, that's all. -That's all you talk about, anyway. MAX (NARRATING): Times are bad. I've never left my family before, my brother, my dad, my mother, my sister, Laura. CONDUCTOR: Excuse me. All aboard, please. MAX'S SISTER: Max? MAX'S MOTHER: Give him this photo. CONDUCTOR: All aboard! MAX'S MOTHER: This is so you won't forget us, Max. MAX (NARRATING): You know, the thought of leaving home never really entered my mind. 2,000 miles. God knows I worked hard looking for this job. Here I am, on my way. MAX'S FATHER: Look at him. Lazy, good for nothing-- -Where you headed for, son? Willowgreen? What takes you out there? -I'm gonna be the new teacher. [MUSIC PLAYING] MR. MCDOUGALL: Hey, you! You the new teacher? -Yes, I am. I'm Max Brown. You must be Mr. McDougall. -Hurry up. We've got a 12-mile drive up the district. [TRAIN WHISTLE] -Really? That far? -If you don't keep moving, you get frost bite. [MUSIC PLAYING] MR.

Todd and Beth have a few years to go yet. -Hello. Uh, I'm sorry, Charlie. What grade did you say you were in? -He's the teacher, and he doesn't know what grade I'm in? -The teacher's new here, Charlie. -I've got something else to do. -You must excuse Charlie. He's not usually so shy with people. You know how it is, you being a teacher. -Hey. Know what time it is? "Amos and Andy" time. It's my favorite program. I never miss it at home. -We don't have a radio. -We have a radio, but the tube is busted. -Well, you may not have a radio, but you've got Max Brown. And I read a terrific joke in the "Star of Phoenix." Shall we hear it? OK. A little boy is sitting on the curb crying and sobbing his heart out. And a man comes up to him and says, little boy, what are you crying for? And the little kid goes, [SNIFF] Father called Mother a waddling goose. And the man says, yes? Uh, and the little boy goes, [SNIFF] and yesterday, Mother called Father a stupid jackass. And the man says, well, yes. But why are you crying? And the little boy says, well, what does that make me? [CHUCKLES] [CLEARS THROAT] -[BELCH] Time to go to bed. Got to be up early in the morning. CHARLIE: Why does he have to sleep in my room? MYRON: Because Pa says so. CHARLIE: He isn't even our teacher yet. Why can't he sleep-- MAX: Goodnight, everybody. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. CHARLIE: Why can't he sleep at the school, like Miss Williams did? -This is a cold room. -Well-- --[SIGHS] We can't stoke the fire all night. Coal is scarce. Well, goodnight. -Goodnight. Thank you, very much, for the lovely dinner. [MUSIC PLAYING] CHARLIE: Git! Come on, boy! Git! Heyah! Heyah! Heyah! Git, boy! Heyah! Heyah! [BABY CRYING] -Good morning. -Sit and have some breakfast, before you go. -No. Really, I couldn't. -At least have some coffee. It'll warm you up. -Really, I couldn't right now. I'll be back in a minute. [COW MOOS] [CHICKEN CLUCKS] [COW MOOS] ANNE: Do you want to see our calf? -Oh, uh, yes. Yes, I do. Uh. -We had two, but the other one died. -Aw. -Dad says it was just as well, because there wasn't enough feed anyways. -Well, he's a nice calf. -You ought to go and see our baby pig. -Oh, uh, maybe later. Huh? -Team's hitched. Time to go. MAX: Brr. Brr. -What do you want to see first? -I would like to see the toilets, please. -Downstairs. Chemical toilets. Best in the country. Watch your head. -Oh, my god. -Come on. I'll show you the rest of the place. Nice place, eh? Well, how do you like it? -Is there somewhere else where-- where I could stay? -Nobody wants to take the teacher full-time. But some agreed to take you for about a month. -I have to move every month? -It's a question of taxes. -I don't understand. -Well, the government work's still gotta be done, roads graded, coal's hauled to the school, miserable jobs like that. Folks get a tax credit for it. -And boarding the teacher is one of the miserable jobs. [CRACK] -Your strap. Gotta show these kids who's boss. -I won't be using that. -You'd better get used to using it. There's some pretty big kids in grade nine. [CRACK] [LAUGHS] -I borrowed money from my brother to come here. (YELLS) How can I buy food? MR. MCDOUGALL: (YELLS) We'll see you don't starve. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Somebody get a pail. Somebody get water. -If you don't keep the lids on tight, you'll get a gut ache. -This is yours. It's freshly killed. -What do I do with the, uh-- -Cook it, of course, and eat it. -I don't know how to cook meat. -City folks. -The only thing he knows about meat's what he sees in brown paper. -I'm cutting you off a ham. Roast this in your oven. It's about a 12-pounder. And you can eat it hot and then cold. And here. We heard about you running behind the sleigh. Go on downstairs and let us tend to our duties. -Thank you, ladies. -He won't even last a month. -Oh! Oh, you surprised me. -I'm sorry. -That's all right. I washed the shelves and painted them. -Oh, nice. Thank you. -The stove's a disaster. -Did-- did-- are you, uh, are you English? -[SCOFFS] How can you tell? I think I've got a Union Jack painted on my tongue. -It's a nice to-- it-- it's a nice accent. Well, uh, I'll let you finish here. -Where are you from? -I'm an Eastern city boy. -City boy? Lord, how you gonna stand it here? Well, I-- I didn't mean that. Really. Canada's a nice country-- in the spring-- sometimes. ONE OF WOMEN: Alice? [KNOCK ON FLOOR] -Sometimes. -Where did you live before you came here? -London. Thank you. I was a war bride, one of the thousands of British girls who were led to the planes like lambs into the wilderness. -You must have been quite young. -Ooh, I was that green. I used to tease Bert. Bert's my husband. I used to say, are there any Indians? He'd say, sure, Indians all over the place, just like in the movies. Bert was one to tease. ONE OF WOMEN: Alice? [KNOCK ON FLOOR] -Some raw fish, darling. Here. Good for ya. -Good for what? -Good for making porridge. Just put it in a double boiler. It'll stick to your ribs. Come on, Alice. It'll be getting dark soon. -Uh, thank you, for the, uh, help. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Class stand, please. We'll repeat our Lord's prayer. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in heaven. Class begins at 9:00 AM. -Well, I had to take the team down to the barn and unhitch 'em. -Would you please allow extra time for that? -Well, I had to drive 11 miles picking up some of the kids. -Who are you? -Jake Stevenson. -Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as-- as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. -Boss says you can use the water that's left for cooking and all. He's not as pretty as the last one. [LAUGHTER] -Before we begin our class, I'm going to take the role. Now if we can go from front to back, loud and clear, please stand when you say your name. -Cathy Friesen. -You already know my name. -Oh, uh, of course, I do, Anne.

We have a lot of work to do. -Teacher? You didn't tell us your name. -I did-- thank you, Summer. My na-- [LAUGHTER] My name is Max Brown. -[READING OUT LOUD] -Perfect, Myron. Wonderful. What? Are you boys having recess a little early today? Come on. Get back to your work. -I have nothing to do. -You have your algebra problems. -We finished both of these. What do we do now? -Teacher? -What, Betty? -The first graders are finished with these. -All right. Would you get them a book out of the shelf, please, and read it to them? -What should I read? -Whatever you find, something appropriate. Are you sick? What's the matter with you? Let me see your algebra problem. -Don't know nothing about algebra. -Me neither. -Me neither. -Where is Bob Sanderson? -Downstairs. He had to go make a little visit. -He had to go and make a little visit. How are you boys gonna learn anything about algebra making little visits? Bob? What are you doing asleep on my toilet? [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] [WHISTLES] --[BETTY READING QUIETLY] where virgins were abducted from their beds by painted thugs and painted [INAUDIBLE], where they would be transported to ships ready to carry them to all corners of the world, where every man were willing to pay the price of their-- -What are you reading? Where did you get this? -There. -Thank you, Betty. That will be enough reading for today. -I'm sorry, sir. -I'm not going to be disturbed by you boys back there again. Now I don't want you sitting together. -But these are the bigger chairs. The others are for the smaller kids. -Teacher? You can move the chairs. That's what Miss Williams had to do. -Please, Summer. Thank you. -Teacher, he got my chair. [CRIES] -All right, Jake, give your brother back his seat. -He can have mine. -[CRYING] -Teacher, you know what John's doing? -I see what John's-- uh, all right. Class dismiss-- [LAUGHTER] Who took my clapper? Get out of here. Go on, get out of here. Get out of here! [MUSIC PLAYING] I've gotta get out of here. [BANG] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Mr. Bishop? I would like for you to find me another place to live. And Mr. Bishop, I wish you would tell the parents, please, not to give their kids things like-- like bullets, and to make sure that their kids are housebroken, and to tell them to leave my clapper alone. And Mr. Bishop, something's got to be done about the food that I've been getting. That pig thing that I was given yesterday was still breathing. It wasn't even cooked. And finally, finally, Mr. Bishop, I would like my salary in advance! MAN (ON RADIO): I'd have been the first one to grab him. MAN (ON RADIO): Man has more courage when he sees it, by golly. MAN (ON RADIO): He got him. Just made it. Hands is lifting him up on deck. MAN (ON RADIO): Good for him. MAN (ON RADIO): Boy! Oh boy! MAN (ON RADIO): Good for the lot. Men, gimme a cheer. The lad's won his way across to the rescue. Let everything outside hear it. [CHEERS ON RADIO] MAN (ON RADIO): So Jack reaches the Pelican safely at last. But will there be time to rescue Captain Hann and the crew? Be sure to listen in at the same time tomorrow evening to find out what happens next. -So how was your first day? -I got through it. -Are you staying for supper? -Well, I'd like to, eh, uh, if it would be no trouble. -No, it's no trouble at all. -Thank you. MAN (ON RADIO): --as a hot meal. Eat Wheaties tomorrow morning. Eat Wheaties and sliced bananas for breakfast some mornings too. You will say it's a marvelous combination. -Well, what is it? -Uh, well, it's, uh, uh, my salary. -Your salary? -Just as matter of, uh, detail. Uh, when am I going to be paid? -Oh, there's-- there's plenty of time for that. MAN (ON RADIO): David Owens, David [INAUDIBLE], and the makers of Wheaties.

I really like hockey. -Oh, I look forward to every spring, because it brings baseball. Leading up to that World Series. Boy, them New York Yankees, eh? [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] -Could we talk salary? -Well you-- tonight? -Yes. I would like to. I thought, because you were the chairman of the school board. McDougall said something about $450. Now I presume that's for the six months. -No. That's for the year. And figuring the year is 10 months, that figures to $45 a month. -Well, that seems very low. -Well, how-- of course, we'll, uh, have to take off for the food that folks is providing. -Food that folks are providing? -That figures to, uh, about 20 a month. -Tw-- tw-- that barely leaves, uh-- -And then there's heating and, uh, additional repairs. -Oh, I see. Uh, in other words, I'm-- I'm paying you $45 a month for the privilege of teaching here. -No, not quite. You have something to show for it. Still leaves you about 20 a month clear. -That's not enough. -Well, in-- in a sense, you're, uh, sorta learning on the job, as they say. And-- -$20 a month? I would never have come. -It's a hell of a lot more than a lot of farmer with 30 years experience are getting right now. -When-- when-- when am I going to receive the first $20? -Well, why you in such a hurry? -I'm-- I-- I borrowed money to come here. I borrowed money from my brother to come here. I need clothes. -Well, what for? You ain't going no place. -Mr. Bishop, I would like to know, please, when am I going to receive my first month's salary? -Well, we can't give you any cash. You'll have to take a promissory note. I'll be damned if I won't be able to make that good. -Promissory note? MR. BISHOP: Yeah. MAN (ON RADIO): (SINGING) --I can't, I can't give you anything but love. -Uh, I have to leave. -Uh, what about dinner? -I'm-- I'm-- I'm not hungry. MR. BISHOP: Yeah, well, my wife's-- -How we doing over here? John, what are you doing? You're kneeling on Halifax. Come on. Get up. Move over. What is Vancouver Island doing in the middle of, Hudson Bay? That's where I'm from. -You mean that's the whole country? -Well, no. We've made it to scale, or at least we've tried. But, uh, may I have a pencil, uh, Myron? Thank you. The difference between Ottawa here, which is the capital of Canada, and Edmonton, which is capital of Alberta, is 2,210 feet. -You mean miles. -I mean miles. -Ottawa has a canal. I visit my aunt there. -Oh, all right. Well, uh, you're right. You're right, Summer. Let's make a canal right here. -The map's falling apart. -OK. -The map's falling apart. -All right. All right. Calm down. Uh-- all right, I have an idea. Let's draw the map. Draw it in pencil, and then, uh, we'll fill in the colors afterward. All right? -My pencil's broken. -I can't find mine. -You take that pencil. And uh, I have some more downstairs. I'll go get them. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Those of you who have pencils, go ahead. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Leave it alone! [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Did you make this? [INTERPOSING VOICES] -All right! What is happening here! What have you got here? -It's just a drawing. -It's very nice. I'm glad to see somebody in this classroom is creative. They're excellent. Very nice. -That map wasn't worth a piece of horse manure anyway. -I beg your pardon? -Oh, nothing. Hey, would you like me to take this to the rubbage dump? -Yes, I would. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAX: Mr. Bishop? I've having a lot of trouble with Jake Stevenson in school. I-- I don't know what I'm going to do about him. -Look. My old teacher, Dwight Tucker, was tough. The old skunk. He always said there was three things to remember in a class. Don't be too pouty. Remember, you're the teacher. They're the student. Never punish two kids together. You can get the other one next time. And never get yourself into a position where you have to do something drastic. Avoid showdowns. Hm? -I don't-- but, uh, what am I going to do about Jake? -Oh, it's time for that mystery. -Lyle? That Harris Montgomery is here to see you. -Oh, damn. What does he want? -Sorry to bother ya, Lyle, but it's important, you being the chairman of the school board. -What is it? -Like to use the schoolhouse for a meeting. -What sort of a meeting? -A political meeting for the new socialist party that's being formed. -Nope. -Dan Throwbridge is coming over from Kindersly. He really knows how to run a meeting. -I know all about Dan Throwbridge and his kind. Come and spend scarce tax money to educate the idle, and then what happens? Our educated ones come back here and cause a lot of trouble. Damned eggheads. Eh, sorry, teacher. I'm not speaking about you. -So you're the new teacher. -Hello. How are you? -I don't want the school house used for politics. -You let a liberal candidate speak there in the spring. -That was different. -Sure! That's different. He's your nephew. [DOOR SLAMS] MAN (ON RADIO): That was swell. MAN (ON RADIO): I'm glad you liked it, Harry. MAN (ON RADIO): But tell me, how does it feel when you're in love? -Pleased to meet you, teacher. I'll see you at the dance. MAN (ON RADIO): And that, folks, is exactly the way you feel in the famous Dodge Air Glide Ride. Visit the show room of your local Dodge dealer. -Ah, damned rattle head. -Rattle head? -Yeah. That's what we call, uh, uh, people who are always wanting to change everything. You know, uh, radicals. Harris Montgomery, the great free thinker and non-worker. One thing I'll say for this depression. It's made 10 million experts that never knew nothing before. MAN (ON RADIO): The Shadow knows. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Has he asked for me? -Will you know if he has? -We will proceed no further in his business. -We will proceed no further with this business. It's lunchtime. Come on, end it. -Then I asked if he wanted to see our baby pig, and he said no. And then I pushed him along. Then he pulled me back. -Thank you, Myron. Pearlie? Here's an extra egg and some cheese. You take them. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Sammie? Come here. Why don't you take this? I can't eat all this. All right? Uh, Violet? You? Huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on, Mary. Don't dawdle. -Oops. Mrs. Field? -Oh. -Hello. -Hello. -Oh, what a nice horse. -Ah, she's old, but I like her. Bert thinks she's useless. Well, did the porridge stick to your ribs? -It stuck to my ribs, it stuck to the floor, stuck to the ceiling, it stuck to the, uh, oven lid. Like cement, it stuck. -How are you getting on at the teacherage? -Uh, the teacherage is a combination of a bottomless pit, the Moose River Mine, and the Black Hole of Calcutta. -[LAUGHS] -Actually, I think it's, uh, haunted by the ghosts of teachers who have lived there in the past who have died of loneliness. -I told Bert about you in the teacherage. He laughed. But then he thinks anyone that's not from here abouts is a bit-- well, is a bit daft. Well, we've got to be going. -Oh, would you mind if I spoke to you for a minute about Mary? -Oh, I know. She's a-- she's a little shy. -Oh, no. No. She's showing a talent for drawing. Her notebook is just filled with sketches that are really quite good. -Oh, thank you for your interest. Mary? Come on, sweet. Got to be going. -I think we should really try to encourage any signs that she may show. -I think that anything you do to encourage her will be very well appreciated. Well, bye-bye, then. -Bye-bye. Hope to see you soon. [MUSIC PLAYING] --[SINGING LOUDLY, OFF TUNE] Oh, sweet mystery of life at last I've found you. Oh, at last I know the secret of it all. Oh, the burning, yearning, churning, yearning, burning. -You keep coming all this way to bring Mary those art materials. -Well, uh, it's a beginning. But, uh, I really feel that she could use some finer materials. And, uh, I hope you don't, but I've-- I've written a little list of things that I thought would be helpful and an address on the back. I thought perhaps your husband, uh, might write away for them. -Oh, I-- I don't know what Bert would think about that. But I could put a mail order in the post when I go to, uh, Alsask next week. -Well, that would be great. -No, no, no butter. No. This is, uh-- hot bread on a winter day, this is wonderful just as it is. Uh, could I ask you a favor? You're going to go to the post office at Alsask? Would you post a letter for me? -Of course. -Um, never mind. -To a girlfriend, eh? -I wish. To my ugly brother who has a job. -So do you. -I can't even get paid. Look at this. Promissory note. I'd like to tell Bishop what to do with that promissory note. -[LAUGHS] -You can't eat a promissory note. -Depends what sauce you put on it. [TRAIN WHISTLE FAR OFF] -I tell you, sometimes I feel like chasing that train and jumping a ride back home. -Why don't you? -Yeah. Well, a classmate of mine once jumped a box car to Vancouver looking for work. He never made it. He stayed on top of the car when the train pulled through the tunnel in the Rockies. He fell under the wheels. He was overcome by the, uh, smoke and the ashes from the engines. -Dear lord. -He wanted me to go with him. It's frightening how much we take for granted. Dammit. God, I miss my family. All my life, I'm used to having people around me. That's Roger or Laura. [SIGHS] When you're from a family, you're never really alone. There's always somebody to talk to, water in the taps, light in the bulbs. [BABY CRIES] -Well, sorry. Little Davie must have a problem. [BABY CRYING] Mary? Why is Davie crying? Is he wet? [MUSIC PLAYING] You should have brought him in, Mary. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SQUARE DANCE MUSIC] -Hey, Bill. You watch it, eh? -How are you? We're a little late because Bert was trying to find the neighbor to put a new engine in-- -Alice, what a pretty dress. Never seen you wear that before. -Oh, it's, uh, from a friend of mine's trunk in London. Don't get too many chances to wear it here. -It's pretty. -People just dance themselves to death. I got so many trunks when I first came here. I thought Bert's brother was going to faint when he saw how many. He was the one that had to cart them over to Bert's farm. Bert told him, here's the girl from England. She only brought half of it. The rest of it's on the next train. Bert thought that was so funny, he laughed for a good half hour. -Have you never been back? -No. [COUNTRY MUSIC] -He's fallen. Are you all right? [MUSIC PLAYING] -You're the teacher, ain't ya? -Yes, I am. -I'm Lester Sinclair. You have three of my kids in your class. -Sure. I have Sammie and Pearlie and-- -You've been giving them food, and they don't need charity. -What? -Shaming them in front of the other kids, and me in front of my neighbors. I can provide for them. -Oh-- oh-- -Just listen to me, teacher. -But, sir-- -You put stuff in their heads, and I'll put stuff on the table. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Let's go somewheres quiet where we can talk, hm? MAN: You should be working to improve society. -Oh, my god. [BABIES CRYING] -Poor Sinclair. He got so desperate, he had to feed his sheep Russian thistle. Two of his lambs scoured so badly they died. Look at that there. "Unemployment Reaches New High." These are rough times, I'll tell ya. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Mr. Eberhard over in Alberta want to give people the money, $25 a month to every man, woman and child. -Without earning it? -Well, don't you see? He earns it by being a consumer. You pay a man for consuming. So he buys things, keeps the wheels of industry turning. -You'll wake the baby. -Oh, my god. Let's go somewheres else. [BABIES CRYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] --Stand up! [MUSIC STOPS] -Get out! Get out! Get out! [ANGRY VOICES] ONE OF THE MEN: Allow me. [ANGRY VOICES] -Cool down. [ANGRY VOICES] ONE OF THE MEN: Jeez, don't back down. ONE OF THE MEN: Not in front of the children. ONE OF THE WOMEN: Oh, break it up. ONE OF THE MEN: Come on. Grow up. -Go shake on the thing. Come on, shake hands with him. -Did you downstep? ANGRY MAN: Let go of me! -Come on here. This is a school house. [ANGRY VOICES] ONE OF THE MEN: Hey, that's the blamed teacher. [CHILDREN CRYING] -I don't know what's going on around here, but boy, oh boy. Quiet, everybody. Quiet, please. There's nobody hurt, and it's been a long night. So I think we ought to go home and milk the cows. Let's all sing a little song you know. Go ahead. Take the lead. [PLAYING MUSIC] -You all right? -I'm all right. I had the wind knocked out of me. -Jay, let's go. -That's no concern of yours, woman. Mary, where's your brother? Bill, come on. We're going home. [MUSIC PLAYING] -[READING ALOUD FROM SCIENCE BOOK] -How's that? This one here. This one must be-- I think so. Looks good, huh? [READING CONTINUES] -What are you doing? -Nothing, teacher. -Nothing? What do you mean, nothing? -Well, I didn't do that. The pictures were loose already. Somebody else must've done it. -What are you lying for? It's a brand new encyclopedia. It's never been touched before. -Well, what's a few pictures? There's lots more in that book. -You have to stay after school today, Jake. -I can't do that, teacher. I've got to help my old man saw some pauper poles. -Just the same, you stay after school. -And after that, I've got to milk four cows and separate the milk. -All right. I'll give you a choice. You either stay after school, or you get the strap. -I'll take the lickin'. -Class dismissed. -But we still have 20 minutes to go. -Well, class is dismissed. 20 minutes early today. Go on. That's enough. You can go now. Close the-- close the front door on your way out. [SNAPPING SOUND] [SQUEAKING] -Well, how do you do? How do you do? I guess I'm supposed to feel sorry for you, huh? Well, I don't. Well, crawl off then. Go on. Go on. Get the hell outta here. [SOUND OF WIND] -Blow, blow, thou wind winter wind, but thou art not so unkind as man's ingratitude. Thy tooth is not so keen, because it is not seen, although thy breath be crude. -Teacher? It sounds like Shakespeare spent his winters in Saskatchewan. -Well, Shakespeare's from Saskatchewan. -Oh. -Don't you children know anything? Shakespeare is from Saskatchewan. -Where's the water today, Jake? -My pa says I don't have to bring it no more. -Well, I depend on that water for, uh-- the children depend on it. I-- I depend on it for my cooking. -My pa says I don't have to bring it. -Well, what am I going to do? -I don't know. -Well, all right. Well, uh, let's clean up this classroom. -You know, my old teacher, he'd never of strapped Jake and risked having his water cut. -All right. Thank you, very much. -Oh, you're welcome. Any time. [WIND BLOWING] ALICE: I've left home. I've left home for good. These trousers are Bert's. I know they're not very flattering, but-- but they were warm. Thank you. -I'm going to make something hot to drink. -I'm fine now. I'm just going to catch my breath. I-- I've got to go. -Well, where are you going? -I don't know. I-- -You're not going out in that weather. I made some very nice soup. I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting anybody for-- -Please. Please? It was awful of me to come here in the first place. I-- I didn't mean to. I just got on Nellie's back and rode away. Did you ever feel you had to-- to go away? Away from where you were? And no matter what you did, you had to go? -Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Yeah. That's the way I felt this morning when I-- when I knew-- when I knew-- oh, dear god. I feel-- I feel almost silly, silly talking to you like this, but I had to talk with someone. These hard winters are so long, so long. And I'm cooped up with the children. I love my kids, but the same noses to wipe, the same diapers to change, the quarreling and the fighting and the questions. -I know. I know. -And Bert-- do you think it's possible to hate a man, to detest him because of something he says? Well, we never died of winter yet. Over and over again. [WIND BLOWING] I still remember that train ride from Halifax to Saskatchewan. Of course, I was only 19, I remember. The country was so big. I looked out of the train window, and I could just see all these beautiful scenes. And I said to Bert, is that what our farm is going to be like? He laughed and he said, hell, in Saskatchewan, we don't even that a farm. Wait 'til you see it, honey. Wait 'til you see it. (QUIETLY) And when I-- I saw it, I started crying. It-- it was just-- -Alice, what are you doing? -I shouldn't have come here. I have to go. I have no right to bother you with my problems. They don't even know that I'm here. -Alice, this is a blizzard. You can't go out in this weather. People die in blizzards. -Cruel are you, so cruel in every way. I got three kids. When I left him, I meant never to go back. Where do I go? Where do I go? If I'd have known [INAUDIBLE] or-- or this life. Maybe a man has-- has to be cruel to survive here. -Maybe. Maybe, sometimes. -Oh. You've got plays. "Arms And The Man," "Private Lives. I used to do drama when I was at school. Director said I was very good. Sybil and Ellie. Hm. "Ellie, Ellie, dear. Do come out. It's so lovely. It's heavenly. Look at the lights of the yacht reflected in the water. Oh, dear. I'm so-- Oh, dear. I'm so happy. Oh, could-- could we read this together? Could we? Oh, please. "I believe in being kind to everyone and giving money to old beggar women and being as gay as possible." -"Would you be young or old, if you could choose?" -"No, I don't think so, not if it meant having awful bull's glands popped into me. -"Cows for you, dear. Bulls for me. -We certainly live in a marvelous age." [LAUGHS] -"I do love you so." -"I don't know, dear heart. It gives me the shivers." -Swivel your face around a bit more." -Oh, that-- I-- I've got a line. Shall we do it again? -"Sw-- swivel your face around a bit more." -"Is that better?" -Very much. Thank you, kindly." -"Darling, you are so terribly, terribly dear, and sweet, and attractive." -That's very good. -Oh, you-- you are too. -You're wonderful. You're really wonderful. That director was right. -Do you get cold living down here? -Sure, sometimes. But, uh, I have-- I have warm blankets. And, uh, actually, this coal back here keeps it pretty comfortable most of the time. -I feel terrible putting you out of your bed. -Don't be silly. I have a lot of reading. And, uh, I've got a lot of things to do. I've got reading and a lot of work. -Where do you keep the blankets? -There, under the bed. -I can't find it. Could you help me? [MUSIC PLAYING] ALICE: I-- I-- I-- I can't. I can't. -What's the matter? -Well, it-- it's [SIGHS] -What is it? -I-- I-- -[SIGHS] [INAUDIBLE]? -It's, uh-- yeah. Max? Max? Oh, god. I wanna go home. I wanna go home. Oh, dear god. [WEEPING] Sorry. -[INAUDIBLE] -[WEEPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -There ya are. Go on, woman. Get your things on. -Uh, she was, uh-- she was lost. And, uh, she was stranded in the storm. There was, uh, there-- there-- there was no way to possibly even, uh, even get back, if we wanted to. -She does these crazy things sometimes. Be damned if I know why she does 'em. Of course, she's in a family way now. Maybe that accounts for it. Sorry, if she bothered ya. I'll take her home now. -Bert, Bert, wait a minute. I wanna-- I wanna talk to you. -Get Nellie out of the barn. Well? -Well, uh, it's, uh, it's Alice. It's, uh, it's being-- being away from her life in England and, uh, her family. You have-- you have to-- -What you gettin' at? -You've gotta do more for her, Bert. You-- you've gotta help her-- -Look here, teacher. Look after the kids, eh? I'll look after the woman. I don't know what you two did here last night, and I don't wanna know. You mention to anyone she was here, I'll break your back. Well, woman, you never have died of winter yet. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Teacher? Whoa. Whoa. Better let Sinclair be. You can't help him. I offered to take up a collection for him, but he didn't want no part of it. Better just leave him alone. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What's the bank want this house and land for anyway? Hardly enough to keep a gopher alive, let alone a family of seven. [MUSIC PLAYING] -(SINGING) I'm a long way from home. And my thoughts ever roam to old Erin far over the sea. For my heart, it is there, where the skies are so fair, and old Ireland is calling for me. Oh, I want to go back to that tumble down shack where the wild roses bloom round the door, just to pillow my head in that old trundle bed, just to see my old mother once more. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. -Real nice. No, no, no. Don't get up. Go ahead washing. Surely to god, there's no need for petty words or false modesty here. -I think I've had a heart attack. -I know how hard it is to get warm water for a bath and keep it that way. You just go ahead and go ahead, and I'll just sit here. -Ooh. -I take a bath every 24th of May, whether I need it or not. I'm having that meeting in two weeks. -What meeting? -For the new Socialist party. I tell you, we're a gonna sweep this country. We've got to teach the voters, in a real democracy, the people must think, not just work for someone because you might get a road job out of it. Can we, uh, can we count on you? -Well, sure. I've got nowhere else to go. -No, no, no, no. As a speaker, I mean. A new voice. The voice of you, put pride in its rightful place. -No, no, no. -Forced to teach school at a starvation wage. -Well-- -Teaching children as poor and downtrodden as the Sinclairs. -Hm. -So you with us? -No. No. -No? What do you mean, no? -Harris, I have a lot on my mind. I-- I have Jake to contend with. I have to work two hours every day to-- -What am I gonna do? I already announced that you'd be there. -Announced? What do you mean you announced that I'd be there? Without even asking me? -I knew you wouldn't refuse. -Harris, I have refused you. -I knew we could count on you. -Harris? -You're the hope of the future. -Harris? HARRIS: The hope of the future. -Harris, I said no. MR. BISHOP: What's this about you speaking at that Communist meeting? -Well, I disagree with it, Mr. Bishop, but it's beside the point. I'm not speaking at the meeting. -Well, Montgomery's putting it around the district you are gonna speak. -Well, it's a misunderstanding. I'm not going to-- -The folks in this area are not gonna take kindly to the teacher speaking at a [INAUDIBLE] meeting. -What I do with my life is my own business. -Well, they might not take you on for another term. -Oh, for ano-- for $450 lousy, stinking dollars a year that I haven't even seen one cent of yet? -Now listen, you. I-- I plan to make them notes good. -For this, I'm supposed to give up my right to say what I want to say when I want to say it? What's happened to free speech? -There's a time and a place for free speech. This isn't it. -You have no right to tell me when and where I can speak. Am I right, Mr. Bishop? -Well, yes. You're right. Your 100% right, up to a certain point. Yes, but you're not gonna speak. -Is this or is this not a democracy? -You're damned right, it is. -Yes. Damned right. -Yeah. What? -Harris? Harris? MRS. MONTGOMERY: Harris is sleeping. Who is that? -Mrs. Montgomery, it's me, teacher, Max. I want to talk to your husband. MRS. MONTGOMERY: No. Harris is sleeping. Come back in the morning when it's time to make visits. HARRIS: What's wrong? MRS. MONTGOMERY: It's nothing. -I'll do it. MRS. MONTGOMERY: Go back to bed. -Do what? -I'll speak at the meeting. -I knew I could count on you. Come back tomorrow, and we'll discuss it. -No, no. I want to talk about it now. I want to talk about poverty in the midst of plenty and about poorly equipped schools and about-- I want to speak for all the young men who are riding the rails, no hope, no dreams, no future. MRS. MONTGOMERY: Harris! -Save the rest of that for the meeting. Let me get some rest. MRS. MONTGOMERY: Everybody, go to bed. -I want to talk about my friend who went to Vancouver looking for a job. He never made it. I want to talk about-- MRS. MONTGOMERY: Go away, already. HARRIS: I am happy we are all here under this beautiful sky and God's own fresh air. We are here to discuss a new party. Why, you ask, do we need a new party, when the ones that we've got are already causing enough problems? We want to find the answers, answers to why we are poor when so many are rich. I ask you why is a bushel of wheat, worth $2 10 years ago, now worth $0.45? -Why, you're damned right. -Why? And now, Max Brown will speak to us from the point of view of you. -Nice to meet you. -Uh, Ladies and Gentlemen, uh, I, myself, have a little joke that I would like to share with you, if I may, uh, a story that dramatizes the situation that we find ourselves in. A man fell into the Saskatchewan River. Five men saw this and, leaning over the bridge, began shouting questions at him. When they learned his name and place of business, they ran off, hoping to get the man's job, and leaving the man to drown. Here, we have a fine generation of young people. Here, we have a fine-- here, we have a fine generation of young people. -Sounds like a bloody fool. MAX: Their bodies are sound with the athletic support that we have given them. The prospect of youth is bleak. Thank you. -Well, how was your speech? -I'd rather not talk about it, if you don't mind. -Well, if you will listen to crackpots and rattle heads-- [MUSIC PLAYING] -How do you like my new Bennett buggy? -Your what? -You see, a car is useless without gasoline to run it. And gasoline is unavailable without cash. You may have noticed there's a considerable lack of that around. -Yeah, I've noticed. -So I'm driving a two-horsepower Bennett buggy, named after our esteemed prime minister, R.B. Bennett, who sits on his broad posterior down there in Ottawa without a thought of suffering humanity. I had something important to tell you, but I forgot what it was. Hop in. -I thought you was busy seeding by now. -No siree. Get up. Get up there. What's the use of putting wheat in the ground to be blown away? If I sowed anyone's fields, it'd be my neighbors, because the wind might blow it back on my land. -Do you think it's going to let up at all? -It's getting worse. The only way to tell if it's letting up is to toss a gopher in the air. And if he digs a hole up there, you know it's too rough to go into the field. I just remembered what I come to tell you. The school inspector's coming tomorrow. -What? -Yep. The wife spotted him over in Alsask. Where you going? Whoa! [MUSIC PLAYING] -I've got a lot of work to do. -Well, stay here. I'll give you a lift. MAX: I can get there faster myself. -We were just having a good talk. [MUSIC PLAYING] That's the trouble with everybody, just sit here, let everything go to pot, without trying to do anything about it. Git up. [MUSIC PLAYING] -All right, during the past million years, withing the past million years, 97% of Canada was covered by what? -Glacier ice. -That's right. I hope you're all as smart as Paul when the inspector comes in. Who can spell Chrysanthemum? -C-R-- -C-R-Y? -C- R- I- S-- -C-H- R- Y- S- A- N- T- H- E- M- U- M. C- H- R- Y- S- A- N- T- H- E- M- U- M. All right, who here can name the great lakes? [INTERPOSING VOICES] [SOUND OF CAR PULLING UP] -Teacher? It's only a Ford. The school inspector always comes with a Chrysler. -Are you sure? -I'm sure. -All right. Thank you, Summer. Could we please all go and have a very quiet, calm, nice lunch? Everyone, just at your desk eating very quietly, calm, and-- all right? Where's everyone going? ONE OF THE BOYS: There he goes! [INTERPOSING VOICES] [MUSIC PLAYING] MAX: Mother of God, what are you doing? That's cruel. These are-- give me that. These are our furry, furry friends. -Yeah. Get him! -They're varmints. They eat the wheat and spoil the crops. -They're loving creatures. -Critters tear up my dad's fields. -That's why the government gives us a cent for each tail, the little bastards! -Bob! Watch that mouth! Summer! -I've got two tails. -I'm gonna be sick. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SQUEAKING] -[SCREAM] [MUSIC PLAYING] -I've got a gopher. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hello? Anyone here? [RATTLING AND BANGING FROM BASEMENT] -(TO SELF] Late. [RATTLE AND THUD FROM BASEMENT] Oh, uh, my name is Woods, school inspector. Just a friendly visit. -How do you do? Nice to meet you. I'm Max Brown. I'm the teacher. -How do you do. Uh, tell me. What time do we begin afternoon classes? -1 o'clock sharp. There's so much to do, it's important to use every minute. -Well, in that case, your pupils have exactly two minutes to appear back. [HUMMING] [SINGING IN GERMAN] [YELLING WILDLY] -There he goes! -Go get it! -Yeah! Yeah! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Mary, for heaven's sake, where is everybody? -(OUT OF BREATH) They're catching all the gophers. -These gophers are-- are very destructive to the wheat. And the children get a cent for each tail. -The species around here are not gophers, they are Richardson's ground squirrels. Richards, R- I- C- H- A- R- D- S- O- N- S. In 1820, one, eight, two, oh, named after Sir John Richardson, a distinguished naturalist and explorer. after their heritage. Now, if you don't mind, I'll go downstairs and have a look at the chemical toilets. Well, and your room. -My-- my room? -And call me when your pupils decide to return, will you? -God. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -You left everyone. -You have to collect the tails and keep score. Then you tell the government, and they pay us. -All right. I want you-- you're 20 minutes late from lunch. Now sit down in your seats. Get out of my way. Get out of my way. -Alan, come on. Think. Concentrate. You had it yesterday, the capital of Portugal. Latin country. Next to Spain. -All right. Thank you, Mr. Brown. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions. This should be an easy one. What is the capital of Canada? Yes, boy? -The capital of Canada is C. That's right, isn't it, teacher? -Well, we'll try another one. A plane-- pay attention, boy! A plain in Canada, extends for about 1,900 miles from the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians. The plain is composed of ancient, worn down rocks which are called what? -I know. I know. -Good. Good. -The spear. -The what? -He means the Shield. -Yeah, that's what I meant. -What is an island? Yes? -A piece of land completely surrounded by water. -What is a lake? Yes, girl? -A body of water completely surrounded by land. -What is a beach? Come on, girl, stand up. -No. INSPECTOR: Get up and speak up. I can't hear you. Come on. Stand up, girl. What is a beach? -A female dog. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Could I see your daily journal, please? -My what? My-- oh. Oh, I-- I don't ha-- I don't have one. Well, with 10 grades, I'm much too busy preparing my lessons and teaching them. -Mr. Brown? There are distinct advantages in orderliness and neatness, cleanliness and punctuality. Your own bedroom, disgusting. I am sorry to tell you, Mr. Brown, that I have never seen such a badly taught class in many, many years of experience. -I'm sorry. -Not very well organized. I mean, how do you find-- look! What is that? -It's my lunch. -Your lunch. A duck! I dirtied my suit. What-- what were they? -Well, they're-- they're the tails of-- of the, uh-- -I'm getting out of here, pronto. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Mr. Woods? Mr. Woods, please. -Mr. Brown, I'll be frank with you. I am going to recommend that you are not to be re-hired. You are not fit to teach children anywhere. [MUSIC PLAYING] -If you want to judge me by what you've seen here today, that's fine. But I have something I would like to say to you. -Please, Mr. Brown, I've got a long journey ahead of me. What are you doing? -What do you know about rural children? -Will you kindly give my hat back? [MUSIC PLAYING] -I've listened to you all afternoon, now you can listen to me. -You are clearly deranged. -Do you think the boundaries of Canada end with Ontario? That rural Saskatchewan children are opposed to know everything printed in books, uh, fr-- from Toronto, New York, even. -For god sake, get a grip on yourself. -Books that show perfect people who live in little cities and get along so well with their neighbors. -Oh. Oh, look. This is going down on your record. [MUSIC PLAYING] -And in all their learning, not even one word about their own environment? -Will you kindly let me get in my car? -If you were not so unbendingly efficient, we might have sat and talked about education and the problems these children are having. -I know how to do my job, Mr. Brown. -You might have opened up their minds with tales of the places that you have visited in this world, countries that they might even not-- not even get the chance to see. Instead, you quote them details, and I play the bum. -Let me tell you this, Mr. Brown. You will be fortunate to find another job anywhere, from one end of this great dominion to the other. These are hard times, Mr. Brown. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I don't care! [MUSIC PLAYING] Class dismissed. Maybe you can catch some more gophers. Anne? Cathy? John? May I have your attention, please? I'm very happy to announce that you have all passed into the next grade. Some of you even deserve it. [LAUGHTER] Well, there-- there should be something wise and wonderful to say to you all today, but, uh, frankly, I can't think of a darn thing. So, uh, good luck. Class dis-- [LAUGHTER] (ALL SINGING] Sing your way home at the close of the day. Sing your way home, drive the shadows away. Smile every mile, for wherever you roam it will brighten your road, it will lighten your load, if you sing your way home. -OK, come on. Get out of here. [LAUGHTER AND CHEERS] -Bye! -Good bye! -Bye! -Bye! -Good bye. You're free? You're free. Good bye! You're free! You're free! I'm free. I'm free. I made it! I'm free! MAX (NARRATING): On June 18, 1935, I left Willowgreen, no longer to suffer the cold, the dust, the students, the parents who want to live in the black hole of Calcutta. -Going home, eh? -Mm-hm! [MUSIC PLAYING] MAX (NARRATING): On September 8, 1935, I returned to Willowgreen to teach another year. [MUSIC PLAYING]
