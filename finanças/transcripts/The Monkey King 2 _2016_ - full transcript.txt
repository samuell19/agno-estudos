500 years after the Monkey King wrought havoc in heaven, The Goddess of Mercy proclaims the Buddha's decree and appoints Xuanzang, a little monk from Chang'an to go to the West and fetch the sacred Buddhist scriptures. What's that place over there? I heard an old man say it's called Double Boundary Mountain. It used to be called Five Finger Mountain. Five Finger Mountain... Holy monk! Holy monk! Get down now! Hold on, hold on! What shall we do with the white horse? What do you think we should do? You're well-built. Why don't you two go save him? - What? You take care then. - Take care! We won't meet again! Mr. Tiger, This horse has a touching story. He was an imperial horse but he's now on this long and tough journey with me. And he has family, just like you do. So why not... Hey there. I'm talking to you! Come closer! Closer! Yeah, you see that? Who are you? Hey. Help me rip that rotten rag off! Yeah. That's it! But it's a charm. Rip it off! I can't mess with a charm! If you don't wanna be tiger's food, just do it! Golden Staff! Naughty boy! Long time no see. It can't be you, can it? It probably isn't. The Goddess asked me to accompany a monk fetching scriptures. I'm afraid you're mistaken, sir. I'm from the Great Tang Dynasty in the East... The Great Tang Dynasty in the East! Yes! You're the guy! The Goddess said so. I'm the one who will escort you to the West. Escort me? I don't think I need it. Speak louder! No, thanks, sir! You heard that, Goddess? He said it himself he doesn't need me! I'm not shirking my duties. Then I'll be off now. Baldy! What the heck is this thing? Why can't I take it off? The Goddess gave it to me. I've no idea, either. Baldy. Don't fool around! Take it off me! Stay still. There are words on it... Stop fidgeting! I can't see the words clearly if you keep moving. Oh, it's Sanskrit. Seems I can't just simply read it. - So? - I have to chant it. Then just chant it quickly! Please! Sir! Can you tough it out for a bit? It might loosen if you endure for a while. Stop chanting! Stay away! I'll drown myself if you step any closer! Wanna die? Won't be that easy! What on earth do you want? Take this gold hoop off me now! Or else I'm gonna strangle you to... I already told you, I have no idea how to loosen this hoop! Wukong. The young monk here before you was once a boy named Golden Cicada, a disciple of Buddha. From today onwards, he is your master. You should protect and respect him. Only after you retrieve the scriptures from the Thunder Monastery will your golden hoop be loosened. There are no alternatives. I'm bringing those stupid scriptures back right now! The Goddess hasn't finished yet! Somersault Cloud! I'll be there in a heartbeat! Where is that monastery? Sir! How could it be? The Goddess told me to tell you... You can't fly there with one leap. Every moment of suffering on the journey is predestined. Every step is a spiritual practice. - No way! - This is how wonderful life is. What did you say? Every step is what? Wonderful? Yeah, full of wonder! I wonder... Where is the Goddess? Hello? Hello! Sir, The Goddess can hear you. There's no need to be loud. Shut up! Go away! How dare you! Give me my horse back! Enlarge! Enlarge! Isn't it marvelous? If it's going to be marvelous the whole way, we could share the journey together. You've eaten someone else's horse I have to get even. By not answering, are you agreeing? Brother Monkey. Good boy. What's with you? Just mount the horse! You're not expecting me to carry you, are you? Sir, the next time you feel the need to kill, shall we discuss before you do that? Not a chance! Why don't you ride the horse? Flying is so tiring, isn't it? Why do you talk so much! Can't you just shut up? It's very late now. The White Bone Lady is coming out to snatch kids! Dad, stop scaring people! But it's true! How much did we make today? Let me check. Alright. Forget it. Let's close. Yes. Lady White Bone... please don't! No! Lady White Bone! Spare my daughter! Please! Please don't! Lady White! No! Sweetie, It's already so late at night. You're still up? That's quite bold of you! After doing so many terrible deeds, you can't just always put the blame on me. Everyone has mistaken you for me. Tell me. What am I supposed to do about that? Madam, please spare me! I swear I won't do it again! I also swear that you will never do it again. We just can't disobey our king's decree! Oh really? That's tough. Are you afraid? Then why are you still after the scriptures? It's precisely because I'm afraid that I must get the scriptures. What's in the scriptures anyway? The truth. The truth about the world. Monk, There's only one way to discover the truth! And that's with my Fiery Eyes! Aren't they scary? Pervert! Pervert! Pervert! Naughty boy! My friend, I have to say, your monkey is a really nice breed. But he just looks... too ugly. You're not a monkey keeper, You're the scripture fetcher! Yes, I am. You're finally here! Brother Sha! Bajie! How am I so handsome? How dare you, pig demon! Mind your own business! Hey, again? Hey no! Cut it out! Stop! No! Won't you stop? Okay? Are you jealous... ...that I'm more handsome than you? You ran into me! Are you blind? Ow! It hurts! Wanna go? Cut it out! Cut it out! I won't fight anymore, really! I'm so cute, so please don't hit me! Speak one at a time, you first! Pig! We're both waiting for the scripture fetcher's directions. Under the guidance of the Goddess of Mercy, we must protect him along the way as his disciples. My name is Zhu Ganglie. I've sworn to the Goddess that I'll abstain from eating meat. Brother Monkey, you can just call me Bajie! My name is Sha Wujing. Do you guys know who I am? The Handsome Monkey King from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit! Then why are you still lying? In 3 sentences if you cannot justify what you've said, l slaughter you! No! Every word we've said is true! - Yeah! - That was the first sentence. What? You've started counting? This one counts, too. Mr. Scripture Fetcher! No! Wukong. Stop! They are monsters! Are you not a monster, too? Out of my way! If you really must be this way, then just push me off this cliff! Master...! Amitabha! I've killed people! Someone is spying on us. Madam, that monk is almost here. Shall we celebrate? What's it to you? This monk belongs to Madam. How many times have I told you? You are not to give me dead flowers. You are really a clumsy flatterer! Madam is a thousand-year-old demon filled with severe grudges. Any living thing in her hands Suffers as if in hell. Do you think you've lived too long? Madam, I'm wrong! What do you mean by "as if in hell"? I am hell! Your reincarnation is in three days' time, Madam. If you can eat that monk by then, you won't need to reincarnate anymore and you'll be a demon forever. There are 3 days to go... We can't let them run off. I'll snatch him back here. No need to hurry. Let's play with them first. Wujing, it's quite late. Let's find us a place to settle down. But it's only noon now. It's so foggy! Master, there is no path! Wujing, in the scriptures it is said that those attached to worldly things are the same as animals. But those who let go of worldly attachments attain Buddhahood. Even if your eyes are wide open, it's no use. You still won't be able to see the path. You have to walk out your own path, step by step. You understand? Look! This is how wonderful life is! Where's Bajie? Monk. The air is very foul here! You stay here! I'll check it out. I got it at last! Anybody in? Monster! - A Human? - Monster! Monster! Don't panic! Don't come over! Come on. Come on! Master, Brother Bajie is yelling. Stop! I'm different from the pigs you eat! I'm a pet! Please. We didn't do anything evil! Don't hurt us! Please stand up. Stand up. Amitabha. I'm afraid you're mistaken Though this disciple looks a bit un... outrageous... He's really quite an honest person! The four of us are just passers-by. We only want to beg for some food. Please excuse our intrusion. The four of you... And there's me, Sun Wukong. There's a really demonic aura here. Why are you still living here? I've gotten used to it. It's getting windy. Are you hungry? Why don't you come inside? It's so windy! Let's not stand out here too long! Come on in... - Come on. - Yes, Master. Put down your knives... Cook some vegetarian food. Please sit down. Brother Sha, water! Big brother, here you go! I need ice water! Where can you get ice water? Blow to cool it. Yeah. That's right. I should blow it. Are those girls your daughters? Have you ever thought about having a live-in son-in-law to guard the entrance? Bajie! Master. I'm giving a sales pitch. Please try not to be so loud. Honorable sir, please let us be. Don't worry, I can give you a lifelong warranty of happiness. Your pig face will frighten them. It shouldn't be a problem now, right? How supple! No problem at all. I'll be extremely filial to you! Sweeties! I'm coming! Wujing, keep a close watch on him, with eyes wide open! Eyes wide open? Like this? Yes, yes, go quickly! I notice you've been rubbing your eyes all this time. There's a small creek over there. You can wash them there. Yeah, Wukong. If your eyes aren't feeling well, you'll feel more comfortable after washing them. Why don't you go? Sit down. You are not permitted to step outside of this circle until I get back. Wukong, this circle is too small! It's already large enough. Wukong, It really isn't big enough! Pretty ladies! Come on out! Sweeties! Honey, No one else is here. Don't be afraid! Come on out! Brother Bajie! Brother Bajie! I can see the worry in your face, Madam. Since life's joys and sorrows have long been predestined, why worry yourself sick, Madam? When I was sixteen I was forced to marry into a rich family. A year later a famine struck the village. Many people died. There was a rumor that I brought the disaster on their village. I was seen as a demon. The villagers abandoned me on a lone cliff, left me for the vultures, to honor the gods. But later I escaped. Therefore, simply passing the time is not necessarily a good cure. Pain comes from stubbornness, not letting go. In fact pain is just like this little circle. It looks hard to overcome. But as long as you take a bold step forward, your pain will diminish. If I can do it, I'm sure you can as well. You can't fool my eyes with your disguise! Master! Madam! Madam! You've freaked her out! Go! Wukong...! Come on out, sweeties! I'm going to find you! Big brother killed her! Madam! Madam! Madam! Are you awake? Big brother! He's flown away. Someone's died! It's the fault of my first disciple. How could he do this? Scaring you like this! I'll keep him under control for sure. Master, help me! Master, the monkey killed two girls! Big brother! You two, shut up! Help me! Master Stop! Evil creature! You've taken three lives. Your sin of killing is too much! They are demons! How dare you quibble! You have the power to destroy the universe. If I let you get away with this it'll be a disaster for the world! It's none of your business! That damned monkey was so violent! Madam, that monkey demon is quite troublesome. Troublesome? The thing I like most... ...is trouble! Wukong... Wukong! Wukong, I had no choice but to do that. Are you always going to use this incantation to control me? As long as you stop killing innocent people, I won't use it anymore. Why do you refuse to believe they are monsters? You and I are really alike. We only believe what we can see with our own eyes. Now I understand why the Buddha put the two of us together on this journey to the West. Wukong, look at these prayer beads. Every bead is from different corners of the world. But they're strung together by a string. Just like you, me, Baijie, and Wujing. What pulls us together is this journey of 36,000 miles to retrieve the scriptures. You may not believe what I see, But I hope you believe that every time I recite the incantation I feel the same pain you feel. That chubby white one must be Bajie. Will anyone have pity on us? Please help save my daughter! The monsters snatched my girl! Can someone save her? The White Bone Spirit's got my girl! Your Majesty, the Tang Priest and his men have entered our country. They're in the city now. Welcome them with a banquet. Drinks! Nice! Your Majesty, is that painting not a depiction of the monster rumored in town? It is. Ages ago The Kingdom of Cloud was prosperous. But ever since this White Bone Spirit moved in, she's done all kinds of evil and has snatched countless kids. She feeds on these young children. Nourished by their spirits, her power increases. She imprisons the children in cages that hang in her Moon Waters Cave. From the mountains their cries echo all year round. I can hear them whenever I close my eyes. Amitabha. Don't worry, Your Majesty. There must be a solution. Holy monk! Your Majesty! Would you rid my people of the evil and exorcise this White Bone Spirit? - Your Majesty... - I only hope I can live long enough to see all those poor kids rescued! Please rise, Your Majesty. Amitabha. Please rise, everyone. Guard His Majesty! I really like listening to your stories. Why don't you repeat it? Go on with it then. Are you going to help that old gossip exorcise me? I'm just going to urge you to reform for good. Fine. You can do me the favor of letting me eat you, since I'm hungry now. Just try and eat him if you can! But today I'm vegetarian. You're the one I'm looking for. Let's talk outside. I have no time. Are you afraid? Of you? Master! Don't be afraid, Master. I will protect you! What the hell do you want? No need to rush. Out with it! We are both the same... ...We're demons. That's why we should help each other out. What could you help me with? That hoop sure looks nice on you. You like it? You can have it! Sure. But can you take it off? Only I can help you if you want freedom. How? After I eat this monk no one will bother you with incantations. Don't you know I can kill you right now? Yes, I do. Go ahead then! Look at this monkey He has to do whatever his master says. Punishment awaits him whenever he makes mistakes. One cent, one somersault! Ten cents, it'll kowtow to you! White Bone Spirit, You don't have the heart to kill me, do you? Let me be the bad guy. It's what I love doing best. Ask the monk to meet me tonight in person, alone. I've taken 49 doses of this blood medicine, but it can't dispel my curse at all! If I can't eat the Tang Priest tonight and I remain uncured, I'll eat you instead! Please calm down, Your Majesty. The situation's a bit different now that Sun Wukong is in the picture. He's a nuisance to the White bone Spirit, too. So, as long as she starts attacking that monkey, we're sure to have a chance. Wukong, are you alright? It's been a long time. How'd the talk go? Nothing special. No way! It is impossible that she'd come talk to you without a reason. Do you really want to enlighten this demon? Yes I do. I can't leave a single life unenlightened on this journey If I do, I will never feel assured. Even if I do manage to retrieve the scriptures, I wouldn't be able to live with myself. Alright. This path you're taking is your own choice. You're really letting him go alone? I'm not sure. If you're still unsure about it, I'm gonna go to sleep. This is fashion. Do you know what you're doing here tonight? I'm here in hopes of reforming you for good. Still? Wukong, why are you here? Wukong, enlightenment is a solemn thing. Don't fool around here! You're the one who's fooling around! You're ridiculous! I'm being ridiculous? You're the one who's ridiculous! Lady White Bone, don't mind him. Let's continue. A bunch of idiots! You really thought you'd fooled me? Brother Sha, isn't her face so pale with fright now? Yeah! Brother Bajie, I admire you so much! Lady White Bone, if you have the guts, have a good fight with me. If you defeat me I'll marry you. If I lose you'll marry me. Fair enough? If it's unfair to you, of course... we can talk or think about ...another way. Pig face. Stay away from me, okay? Are you scared? OK. You left me no choice! No one is allowed to interfere! Leave it to me! Wukong. Can you let me finish? Step back! As long as you nod, I'll take this evil demon to nirvana! I hate being called evil demon the most. Damned evil demon! If you're not an evil demon, then what are you? Let me tell you, I have nothing to lose. I can even kill that monk, and I wouldn't be finished yet. Just you wait. Nobody move. Leave her to me! Brother Bajie! - Bajie! - Brother Sha, stay close to the Master. Someone help! I'm stuck! Master? Where's the monk? I wonder where Forget it Where is he? Do you know what blood tastes like? For years, in order to rid me of this curse, I've drunk a great amount of children's blood. Now it's your turn. Only your flesh and blood can cure my disease. This counts as your karmic reward. You drain the lives of others in order to maintain your own. I don't see a difference between you and the monsters! I'll never be as evil as that White Bone Spirit. Monk, the human world has long been like hell. Even the Buddha cannot extinguish the evil in a human's heart. Can you? Wukong! This sort of person is more poisonous than demons! I can't kill him, either? No, you can't. If you keep doing evil, I'll finish you with this staff! Children, you can go home now. Come with me. Is the Buddha blind? Entrusting such a big task to a wimp like you? If it weren't for this monkey killing his way through with his staff, you wouldn't have made it anywhere! What good have you done in the past? Every word you say is nonsense! And every step you take could kill! By what right do you act like a sage? By what right? Tell me! Thanks, holy monk! Mom! The holy monk saved them all! Let's get going. Holy monk, please wait! The folks of our kingdom will be grateful for your kindness forever. Please accept our gifts. You saved my daughter's life. You're really our savior! Thanks for saving my life. Please accept it. I've said it before. I can even kill that monk. He attacked someone! Wukong! Why did you do this? She's a demon! So is everyone is a demon to your eyes? What a bad guy! Mom! Are you okay, sweetheart? Are you alright? Please quiet down! Easy! Calm down. Be quiet! Jerk! What's wrong with you? You hurt my daughter. I won't forgive you! Brother Bajie! Mom... Holy monk, help! Holy monk, help me! Master, stop chanting! Master, he knows he's in the wrong! Yeah! Help me... Holy monk, help! Wukong. Just leave. Master, this girl doesn't look ordinary. You can't let him leave. Yes, Master. He did that so suddenly... There must be a reason! Monk, they have transformed from monsters. It's just that you can't see through them. My duty is to escort you to the West. Escorting me doesn't mean you can kill at will! In order to escort me, you won't even spare a little girl! Are you just afraid that if I die or if I don't make it to the West, no one will remove this hoop for you? The problem is not the hoop on your head but the hoop encircling your heart. You have to overcome this on your own. There's nothing I can do to help you. Are you really thinking clearly? Just leave. Master! Our paths end here. You don't need to kneel to me. You... Leave! Bajie. Brother Sha. Big brother! The road ahead is dangerous. Do your best to protect him. I'm leaving. - Big brother! - Big brother! Big brother! - Master! - Master! Brother Bajie! Master has been kidnapped by the demon! Really, thank you. If you hadn't told me, I really would've had no idea that he was kidnapped. Now what shall we do? Brother Sha. Now the situation is serious. We have only three options. Option One: You go to Big Brother's home mountain and bring him back. Oh yeah! Option Two: You go to Moon Waters Cave and harass them to buy us time. Excellent! What about Three? Option Three is relatively complex. Just try to figure it out. That is, you go to the demon's cave to buy yourself some time. And then you go to the Flowers and Fruit Mountain to find Big Brother. Aren't you going too? Stop asking stupid questions! We still have the last resort The burdens are yours. The dragon horse is mine Let's split up. Yeah. Why didn't I realize it before? Because you're an idiot! Why didn't I realize it before? You are... an unsympathetic, unfaithful jerk! - I've put up with you for way too long! - You! Does it hurt? It hurts! Brother Sha, hit his face! His face! You can take the horse. Dragon Horse, let's go save Master. Why do you need to do this? Are you curious? Because if I eat you, I can become an immortal demon. I want no reincarnation. I hate being mortal. No reincarnation? What happened in your previous life? In my previous life... the villagers said I brought disaster to their village. I was seen as a demon. That's the story of my past life. It's all true. Don't think you're any different from those who'd left me on the lone cliff. You mortals are just heartless. I hate you all. Hatred can only give birth to hatred. Why must you be so hard on yourself? You're still trying to enlighten me. Listen, your talk of enlightenment is of no use to me at all. Goddess. Why are you blocking the way back to my mountain? Wukong. Even if you return to your mountain today, it is not your final destination. Then tell me, where else I can go? Big Brother, Big Brother! Master was snatched by the monster! Big Brother! Don't be afraid, everyone. I'm here for your lord. Big Brother, only you can save Master, you know! You're really too stubborn. Why can't you just put up with him a bit? He's still so young, and how old you are, huh? Look, Big Brother, A branch can be... easily snapped... snapped without effort, while ten branches together are unbreakable. As long as the four of us are united and bound, there's no place we can't go! No scripture will be out of our reach! He's not here. Why didn't you say so earlier? What should I do? Tell me, what should I do! Big Brother! Look! What an idiot. Wearing Big Brother's suit of armor gives me courage! Wukong, Golden Cicada has waited nine lifetimes for you to be his disciple in this life and for you to be rectified and led to Buddhism. But the monk of this life has abandoned me. Am I at fault? Wukong, in fact it is you who abandoned your master. 500 years ago, you believed only in yourself and wreaked havoc in heaven. But 500 years later, you haven't changed one bit. Why can't you abandon yourself and start believing in others? You have always been judging others with your own standard of right or wrong. What your Fiery Eyes see is truth but what your master sees is heart. Wukong, your master's life is at risk. It is now that he needs you most. Time is up. How about you enlighten me in your next lifetime? I'll be waiting for you right here. I hope this lowly monk's death can take away your stubbornness. Who is it? What happened? Can anyone tell me? Goddamned monkey! Master, I'm back. Wukong! Let's go. Brother Sha, you go! Let me get even... Come! Master! Since the Buddha entrusts you with the scriptures I won't let you die. Hold on! Enlarge! White Bone Spirit, this is your doom of the millennium. Now your spirit will vanish forever and ever. Buddha, I'm willing to help her overcome her doom. Please give her a chance. Xuanzang, if you want to save her, the only way is to lead her to reincarnate into a human. But, as you're a mortal you must give up your own life in return. Are you willing? Yes, I am. Do you really think you're saving me? As long as there is a glimmer of hope, I won't give up by any means. No matter what happens, I'm willing to accompany you on this journey. It's been a thousand years. I'm used to being a demon. When I was 16, they said I was an evil demon. No! Don't! You're not gonna make it Wukong, Lady White Bone wants to meet her end within my body. If I don't lead her to reincarnation, she'll vanish completely. Do you trust me? From now on, I trust you alone. Kill me. No... No way! Wukong, At first I thought, to enlighten was just to educate with words. Only now do I see if I don't get in hell even if I could reach the Thunder Monastery I would not get the scriptures Now I've decided that if she can't change her doom, I will spend this lifetime or even ten lifetimes helping her, without fail. Alright. On the way of 36,000 miles I'll be waiting for your return. Even if it takes a lifetime, I'll be waiting for your return. And if it takes ten lifetimes, I'll still be waiting for you, without fail. Alright. Come on. Big brother! You mustn't do this! No, big brother. Don't do this! If I have the good fortune of doing so, I still want to be your master in the next lifetime. Master! This is where we must say our goodbyes. Master! Master! Big Brother, it's been seven days. Why hasn't Master's soul returned yet? At this rate we should just disband. No more of that "disbanding" talk. Got it? Are we still going or not, Big Brother? As long as Master's golden body is intact, I'll carry his body to the Thunder Monastery in the West to see the Buddha in person. Master, let's go! Big Brother. I'm really hungry. What to do? I can't stay hungry! You only know how to eat. Yeah, yeah... Let's eat hot pot!
