SAILOR MOON SUPERS THE MOVIE THE 9 SAILOR GUARDIANS UNITE! MIRACLE OF THE BLACK DREAM HOLE Gomen-ne, it's hard for me to say Although it's easy to say it in my dreams My thought circuit is about to break down You know right now, I want you with me It has me nearly in tears, this moonlight Can't even call you because it's midnight But my heart is sincere, what can I do? My heart is a kaleidoscope The moonlight guides us to our destination dear Time and again, we'll find each other Counting the sparkles of the constellations Foretelling me the future of this romance We were born on the same planet This is the miracle of romance Shinjiteiru-no This is the miracle of romance It smells so good! MAKOTO KINO I think it's ready... Ow! What was that for?! We're supposed to check if it's done or not! I prefer to follow the instructions in this recipe book THE ABC'S TO BAKING A COOKIE - Oh yeah?! - Yeah! Here, let me take a look. Just a little more. You have to wait until they start turning golden brown around the edges. Told you! It hardened up. You're not supposed to dump the sugar in all at once. Remember, impatience will get you nowhere in life. That is so true... Minako! In case you haven't noticed, you ate most of the chocolate chips. I can't stop myself. It's not easy to shut one's mouth, you know? That's not how you use that phrase... Well, there goes our plan of baking chocolate chip cookies. Wow... That's really clever, Ami. You've been secretly practicing, haven't you? My mother taught me this trick. Your mom? Uh-huh. She's very busy and is away most of the time. But when I was little, she would often bake me cookies to try and cheer me up. She'd say, "Look, Ami. These are special cookies that will give you lots and lots of energy!" The three o'clock fairy is already here. The three o'clock fairy? What's that? Huh? The three o'clock fairy! Oh...it's a silly story. Now I'm curious. Tell us! When I was little, my mom used to always bake me a cake at three o'clock. I once asked why she makes it at three. And Mom said it's because of the three o'clock fairy. It's a fairy who comes around at three telling moms to make snacks for their kids. But at the time, I didn't get what she meant by a three o'clock fairy, so I thought it was that little bird in the cuckoo clock. The three o'clock fairy... There was something special about Mom's homemade cakes. You're right. Whenever my mother baked me cookies, I thought to myself... That there was always a bright side to feeling down. I feel sort of jealous... My mommy in the future can only bake burnt cookies. Why do you have to bring up things like that?! That's so Usagi! I knew it! Those were very touching stories. It sounds like sweets are something filled with wonderful memories. Memories are nice, but what matters most is finding your future happiness! For next Valentine's Day, I'll definitely make sure that my homemade sweets will score me some happiness! Does being skilled at baking help you "score" happiness? It sure does. That's why we're here for lessons. Yup, Mako is a master at making sweets! No, I'm not that good... Does that mean you've already "scored" happiness, Master Makoto? Like they say: Happiness is a journey, not a destination. Mako, that didn't sound the least bit convincing coming from you. But nice try. Thought so... Are my cookies beautiful, or what? Your cookies are ugly! There's no comparison! "UGH" Shut up! My cookies win in the taste department! They're special cookies! One bite will increase your power and courage a hundredfold! Whatever. I already know mine tastes better... Good grief... Hey! Chibi-Usa's batch is really good. You're right! They're delicious. They may look bad, but the taste is perfect. See? Told you. Why are you all taking her side?! I don't care. Mamo will still eat these and say it's delicious. No matter how you slice it, I'm going to win this contest. Contest? Yup. Once Mamo tastes these cookies, I win! Huh? Is something wrong? That's a cute cat. Her name's Diana. I see. How do you do, Diana? That tickles! What are you doing here? Waiting for someone? Let's go home so we can eat it. Mommy, are you excited too? - Yes. - Really? I was watching the children as they come out... They all look so happy. Of course they do. It's a sweets shop. This is a very lovely town. All the mothers here seem so nice. Not all of them. My mommy's clumsy, a crybaby and a scatterbrain. She even steals my snacks and eats them! Then again, I also eat her snacks, too. You're pretty funny. Huh? This town feels so warm and friendly. Even the sweets seem happy. You can tell how the sweets feel? They look like they're about to dance in celebration for making the children happy. See? All I can tell is that they look tasty. No way... I'm Chibi-Usa! My name's Perle. Perle? Yes? Delivery service! I'm here to deliver the greatest love in the world! That little nuisance is hiding somewhere, isn't she? You mean Chibi-Usa? It's not nice to call her that. And she's not here today. Well she's little, and she's a nuisance! She always gets in our way! Mamo... Huh? When did you buy this shirt? Oh this? The other day, when I went shopping with Chibi-Usa. Mamo! I've been meaning to ask you... Who's more important? Me, or Chibi-Usa?! What? Which of us is more important to you? Why do you even ask? You can't answer, can you? I knew it! You care more about Chibi-Usa! And after I came all the way to bring you the world's best homemade cookies... I'm the world's unluckiest woman! Wow, you brought cookies? I'll go make us some coffee. Now for today's news. In a strange series of incidents, children around the world are disappearing at night. These incidents... have so far been confirmed in 43 cities in 27 countries. No details are yet known regarding the children's whereabouts. Here! JUBAN SHOPPING DISTRICT DREAM ROAD Hey! They might look a little ugly, but it's the taste that counts! Just a bite from these special cookies will increase your power and courage a hundredfold! You're giving these to me? Uh-huh. Bye. See you again! JUBAN SHOPPING DISTRICT DREAM ROAD Master Usagi. .. Master Usagi! Mamo... I love you... Please wake up, Master Usagi! What's she doing? Usagi! You're all here! Something strange is going on with Chibi-Usa. It's not just Chibi-Usa. - What? - Look over there. No way! What's going on?! Seems children throughout the city are leaving their homes. Is walking around at night what's popular with kids nowadays? Of course not! Today's news said that children around the world are going missing. There's probably a connection. Hey! You guys hear something that sounds like a flute? A flute? The sound from the flute is giving off an unusual energy. See, if you listen carefully there's a sweet melody The three o'clock fairy is calling me Knock on slumber's door What's that over there?

Knock on slumber's door We're going to a dreamland filled with candy and sweets. Wake up quickly Wake up, everybody! And board the ship for Candy/and Oh, so many- Stop interfering. Who are you?! The children came here on their own free will. So don't get in their way. You're the one who's been abducting children, aren't you?! We won't let you do this to them! Good grief... This interference was unexpected. Papillote! What is that?! It's a candy! A monster?! Bonbon Babies, attack! Stay away! - GO away! - GO away! Chibi-Usa, do something! You do something! Everyone!

And we're not going to let you get away with using that hypnotic flute to abduct all the children! We are the Pretty Guardians... who fight for love and for justice! I am Sailor Moon! And I am Sailor Chibi Moon! In the name of the Moon, - we'll punish you! - we'll punish you! The same goes for us Sailor Guardians! - We will not forgive you! - We will not forgive you! Huh? What is this?! What just happened? I smell something sweet. It's coming from that house. No way, is that... ...a gingerbread house?! Sailor Moon! Everybody! What happened to them? It's an illusion. The sound of the flute is making them see things. Wow! A real gingerbread house! It looks so yummy! Hey! When did you all shrink? You did, too, Venus. You're right... You're all my size. It looks so yummy! - Tuxedo Mask! - Tuxedo Mask! You mustn't bite into that, Sailor Moon! Ow! That hurts! Are you with them, too? Tuxedo Mask! Wait! Stop! Perle? Perle... What do you think you're doing? Brother, how can you resort to such violence and be fine with it?! Poupelin, what is going on? Queen Badiane... Why have you stopped? We can't fall behind with our plans. Yes... But it seems Perle has cold feet. Why are you making us do all these horrible things to gather the children?! Watch your tone, Perle! I can't go along with this! Badiane, I cannot trust you, after all! Queen Badiane is doing this for the children's eternal happiness. I don't see it that way! Perle! So. . .it's that little girl who's swaying you. No! She has nothing to do with it! Continue your work. Badiane! And bring her along with the other children. As you wish. Badiane! Looks like they're back for another round! Attack, Bonbon Babies! Brother! Jupiter... Oak... Evolution! Mercury... Aqua... Rhapsody! No! Tuxedo Mask! Chibi Moon! They got Chibi Moon. ...! Oh no! See, if you listen carefully there's a sweet melody The three o'clock fairy is calling me Knock on slumber's door Wake up quickly And board the ship for Candy/and Oh, so many dreams Mint pie and apple pie Cake makes me happy Cookie gets me excited Enjoy a jiggly pudding Have a bit of chocolate, too Oh no you don't! You're not getting away. Who are you, anyway?

So you're the one who took Perle from me... Yes... I can sense a mysterious energy inside you. Do you wish to join the other children in the Dream Coffins? It won't be long now. Very soon, my Black Dream Hole will swallow this planet. At the center of this castle, my Black Dream Hole is making itself grow larger by absorbing the Sugar Energy from the children's dreams. Until it can engulf this entire planet. When that happens, the foolish humans of Earth will all spend their lives in the Dream Coffins. What a lovely sight it will be... Are you stupid or something? That could never happen. You are so going to fail. Oh? And why is that? Because Earth has Sailor Moon. That's. . .no ordinary black cloud. Mamoru's okay. He'll live. Usako... Mamo... Where's Chibi-Usa? She's safe. That little nuisance will be fine. I promise. It'll be extremely dangerous... We must hurry. If she's cast into the Black Dream Hole, Chibi-Usa will be beyond rescue. Black Dream Hole? We need to rescue her at all cost. This isn't some sort of trap, is it? We have no choice but to trust him. Chibi-Usa gave you that, didn't she? I... We're about to enter the clouds. We'll arrive shortly once we get past through them. I will guide every single child to a world of dreams... A place where they will never get hurt... And I want you fairies to help me. Bye. See you again! Whoa! I'm sensing an intense evil aura coming from this place! But... I don't see anything. W-What's going on?! That's Marzipan Castle, where all the abducted children are being kept. It's a cannon! Load cannon ball! Loading cannon ball! Cannon ball loaded. So we're going to blast Perle, too? Fire! Shine Aqua Illusion! What's the meaning of this, Perle? Why'd you bring them here? We're here to stop Badiane! Return Chibi-Usa and the children! Chibi-Usa? If you mean that little girl, Queen Badiane seems very fond of her. Says she'll provide the best source of energy to grow the Black Dream Hole. What?! How could she...! Unforgivable! You're a fool. You'll die here with the others. Be careful. These people have strange powers. - Papillote! - Papillote! Supreme Thunder! Venus Love Me Chain! Queen Badiane's Dark Energy, the source of our power, is growing stronger. You no longer stand a chance of defeating us. That attack. . .! Who's there?! Protected by Uranus, the Planet of the Heavens, I am Sailor Uranus, Guardian of Flight! Protected by Neptune, the Planet of the Deep Sea, I am Sailor Neptune, Guardian of Embracement! Protected by Pluto, the Planet of Space-Time, I am Sailor Pluto, Guardian of Revolution! Answering the call to a new threat, the Three Guardians of the Outer Planets are here to fight! Uranus! Neptune! Pluto! Dead Scream. What are you three doing here? A huge Dark Energy is growing within this castle. Sailor Moon, Small Lady is in danger, isn't she? There're more of you? How could you humans find this invisible castle? My mirror can see through all forms of deception. Submarine Reflection! Space Sword Blaster! No! If that's the case... Mars... Flame... Sniper! Curse you all! What're you planning to do with the children you've abducted? We're trying to change this planet into a world where children can remain children forever. What's wrong with that?! Queen Badiane! A world where children will never grow up? But you get to enjoy more of life's pleasures as an adult. They should really mind their own business. Right? The ship's okay. Hurry and get on board. Sailor Moon... Who is this boy? He's Chibi-Usa's boyfriend. Right? This is a sacred place. You are not allowed to be here. Where are you keeping Chibi Moon and the children?! The children are right there. What?! Are these all... Children?! How horrible! Stop this, you otherworldly witch! Foolish Perle. I'm trying to create a world that is both sweet and beautiful. Isn't that what you fairies wished for? No one can be happy in the kind of world you're creating! My wish is to protect the places where children can grow up with their family and friends! This girl put those silly ideas into your head, didn't she? - Small Lady! - Chibi Moon! Sailor Moon! You're late! Shut up. What is that?! It must be the Dark Energy we've been sensing. Is that the Black Dream Hole? That is correct! It grows more powerful by feeding on the energy of children's dreams. And now... Stop it! Chibi Moon! No! Fire... Soul! There's a force field around her! Just as I thought, this little girl possesses the finest energy to grow my Black Dream Hole! Oh...? What are they up to now? Our strong feelings for Chibi-Usa will power this ship. Ready? Yeah, let's go! Your puny ship can't get through my force field. Everyone! Give Sailor Moon cover! - Burning... - Shine... - Sparkling... - Venus... - Dead... - World... - Deep... What?! - Sailor Moon! - Sailor Moon! Return Chibi-Usa! My Black Dream Hole demands this girl's Sugar Energy! You will not have her! - Sailor Moon! - Look out! - Chibi-Usa! - Stop! Return Chibi-Usa! Out of my WHY! If you get any closer, you'll be sucked in yourself! Fool! I am the Black Dream Hole! - What?! - What?! And now, I will engulf this planet using this girl's Sugar Energy! I won't let you do that! Perle! Sailor Moon! Chibi-Usa! Chibi-Usa! - Sailor Moon! - Sailor Moon! Chibi-Usa! My transformation... I can't maintain it... Sailor Moon... Damn it! Sailor Moon? These are supposed to be special cookies. One bite will increase your power and courage a hundredfold! Sailor Moon, you're not thinking of...? No, don't! You'll never return...! Sailor Moon... How foolish of you to leap in here! Chibi-Usa... Chibi-Usa... Chibi-Usa... Chibi-Usa! Don't wake her up... Let the child sleep... Usako... What're you doing here? Mamo... Is this your room? Of course it is. Mamo, how's your injury? Nothing to worry about. I see. Thank goodness. Mamo, Chibi-Usa won't wake up. Chibi-Usa? Chibi-Usa ... Mamo? It's okay. Let's let her sleep. Chibi-Usa is having a happy dream. Let her sleep like this forever. From now on, it'll be just the two of us. We'll live here forever, with no one to bother us. But first, we need to save the children and the others! They might already be... Who cares? They don't matter to us. What?! As long as you're here, Usako, I'm happy. Mamo... Huh? Be honest. Who's more important to you? Me, or Chibi-Usa? That's a silly question. You're more important, of course. You're the only person in this world I care about, Usako. Mamo... Yeah? You look handsome, even in my dream. Crisis Power! You broke free from the Dream Coffin?! Why did you leave your Dream Coffin? Sailor Moon, what do you hope to accomplish?! Let that girl go! If you let her go, you can return to your wonderful Dream Coffin. If you don't, you'll be burnt to death along with her. Think about it. If every person remained in their dreams and only had to worry about themselves, then there would be no suffering. I'm growing the Black Dream Hole for your own good! And I thought to myself... That there was always a bright side to feeling down. Memories are nice, but what matters most is finding your future happiness! Like they say, happiness is a journey, not' a destination. That didn't sound the least bit convincing coming from you, but nice try. What?! This light... Is it Sailor Moon? Princess... What is this light?! Sailor Moon! It's Sailor Moon! Sailor Moon. Hand me that girl! I must have the beautiful Sugar Energy she possesses! Now! Curse you... Fine! Then I'll burn you to death! Please, everyone... I need your help. Lend me your strength... Sailor Moon. - Sailor Moon. - Sailor Moon. - Sailor Moon. - Sailor Moon. - Sailor Moon. - Sailor Moon. What?! Impossible! Let's go. Right! - Moon Gorgeous... - Moon Gorgeous... - Meditation! - Meditation! Sailor Moon... She broke through the Black Dream Hole! I want you to hang on to it. You're leaving? I'm a fairy who protects the sweet and beautiful Sugar Energy that grows inside children's dreams. So I'll always be near you. Thank you for the cookies. Give my regards to Diana. Goodbye, Perle. See you again! It's not the memory that's important but the wish to see you again More than sadness I feel glad that I was able to see you The wind from the fading dawn dries the tears on my cheek I smile and wave you good bye hoping to see you again Remember morning moon The voice that calls you If you hear me, fly to me on winged shoes Remember morning moon If you believe, Our season together will continue on
