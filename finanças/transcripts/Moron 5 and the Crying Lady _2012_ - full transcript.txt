Whoever’s like your kind... they will stick on you. Why are you passing through this way? This is upward. We’re going down. Those who are beautiful... are for those equally beautiful.

I don’t have anything to do with that. I don’t even know that McArthur. Even if you bring me to court... I didn’t kill him. Use the Filipino word “kampante” (comfort) in a exclamatory Filipino sentence. Say it! Ma’am maganda po kayo (Ma’am you are beautiful). Thank you. Pero wala kampante (But you don't have panty) I caught Mozart holding this paper. - What’s written on the paper? - Prayer Sir. That god would help me to answer the test. Prayen‘ul kid. Look at this.

We’re through. Huh! Yes. So kiss me. But don’t you dare fall in love with me. Don't worry Pamintuan... you won’t see me anymore. Huh! You’re leaving? You’ll transfer to another school?

You’ve entered a gay bar... your work here is macho dancer. Boys sorry. I know that we need the money. But I don’t want to go as far as this one. Let’s go home. Come on, let’s go home. What does he mean? What does it mean? We’ve settled about this. What is macho dancer? I don’t know. Ijust don’t like how he said it. Can you say it again. Macho dancer. - I like it better. - That can be. He might have had a mistake. Oh hold it! Maybe you've forgotten... you've signed a contract with me. If you don’t want to be sued... wear these costumes and start swaying those waists. Hey, how does it feel? 3 days from now and you’ll get married. Super excited. Here, drink. Look at those dancers. Look... they’re all handsome. You know that I’m conservative. I’m not used to this. Yes. Go on, look. It’s my ﬁrst time in a gay bar. I don’t like such things. Look at that one, he‘s cute. — You are my ﬁrst love. - You’re going to be blind anyway. So you won’t see me anymore. Sisters I’ll go ahead. Hey wait a second. This is your party. I suddenly got dizzy. I think I’m going to have my monthly period... my mestruation is regular. Okay, okay we’ll see you at the wedding. Thank you, sorry. Good night, good night. I don’t know how to thank all of you. Look at you. This is crazy. Don ‘t be like that. I want to cry too. As if you’re not men. Now I’m going to cry too. Hey, shame on you. We’re in the middle of the street. Somebody might see us. Why don’t we just split up the money? So we wouldn’t have to cry. I know why are you crying? Because of him. Sound like retort from you. Here’s your money. Thank you! I dance, didn’t I. I performed well. Don’t ﬁght. Seems all of you are crazy. One moment you’re crying because you love each other. The next scene is you’re ﬁghting with each other. Here’s a church... let's go inside. We should thank up there. Oh my god! Why are those ﬁve in here? Are they following me. Do they know? Let’s sit in front. So they would think we are guests. And then at the reception... we can eat lunch for free. You're so stupid. How would they think that we're guests? We don’t have a gift. I googled them. And I’m right that they are the Moron 5. From the past ‘til now, they are my nightmare. Don’t get paranoid, Beckie. They wouldn’t know. Because you’re a real female now. Don’t worry, she’s a real woman. Are you sure? I’ve been thinking of that before. You should have told me... I’ve got lots of cups at home... I could have wrapped it. Maybe the one’s getting married is a Japanese? How did you know? There... Japanese lantern. We have lots of that at home. My mom used to work in Japan. Really! So your mom must know how to speak Nihonggo? Huh, fluent. I love you. I love you. Come. Go ahead. What Nihonggo do you know? Who do you think you are? You are such a show off.
