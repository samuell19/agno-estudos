- Konrad, do you have the newspaper? - Yes of course. I think we'll put it on his bed. - No, he'll never find it there. We should put it in with the rabbits! - That's funny. - No, they'll only pee all over it. - Yes but— If we put it on the bed, he'll find it tonight when he goes to sleep. - I'd love to see him. Konrad, this is going to be fun! - Come on, you'll see. Follow me. The keys, the keys. - This is exciting! I can hardly wait! - Quiet now. We have to be careful. - Yes Yes. Shhh. - Here. By his feet. -No. Here, under the pillow. -No, You can't see it. On the pillow. -Yes! Come on. And when will I be Pudelström? Later! First he has to read the newspaper- -then we'll see if he can figure it out. Yes, ok. Come on.. "A little eight-month-old dog with a red collar has escaped." "He was of medium size and black with bushy eyebrows" "his fur was curly. Some people think he has run off for an adventure." "But the newspaper's Dog Editor, who is familiar with the dog"... ..."thinks the dog has run away"... ... "to look for his mother, whose name is Daisy." "The dog has been observed by an admiral" ... -..."who has a hut just south of the mountain." Good heavens! We forgot to lock the door to Niklas' house! Then he'll realise we've been there, so it won't be mysterious at all. We'd better hurry before he sees it— Hey! Look out! Damn! Get down! - Ouch! - Do you think he saw us? - Shh! Wait. If you had a dog to guard you, you could run free all day. Get yourself up to the room quick. We'll come back later. - So I'm going up to the room. -No! You have to crawl. - Crawl. -Yes Yes. Like a snake! Hoho! Hello! Niklas? Are you there? - Hi. - Aha, there you are. How's it going with you? - Fine. - Haven't you been, er... wanting a dog lately? - Definitely. Look, there's a runaway dog in today's paper. - Yes, look at that. - If someone found the dog, do you think they could keep it? - You'll have to ask the Dog Editor. - What's a Dog Editor? - Someone who writes in the paper about dogs. - We want to speak to the Dog Editor. - With pleasure, this way. First door on the left. - Thank you! He's asleep. Who is it? - It's me. I want to talk to the Dog Editor. - Come in! I mean, Enter. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm Pudelström, the Dog Editor. Can I take your name please? - Niklas. - I've come to find the dog that ran away. - Excellent. I've been worried all day about that dog. I'm excited to see you. - What's it called? - What.. called .. Yes.. I don't know. No-one knows what it might have been christened. It's just called the dog. That's all! - Right. "Dog ..." It said that the dog is medium size. How big is it? - Yes, what's the average? Something like this? - But you can't go around with your hands out like that all day. - No, maybe you're right. What do we do then? - Get a string and measure. - Absolutely outstanding. Brilliant! There's strings and scissors in the left pocket here. Yes, or else the right. Yes. Really brilliant. The young man is very talented. - Yes, no wonder. His father was best in class back in 1942. - Ah, but in this case, the ability comes from the mother's side. He inherited it from me. - No. If there's anyone with ability in this family it's me. I started school when I was six years old. When I was five, I knew seven poems by heart. One started like this: Two lively brothers, angling in a— As I said, it's very likely the young man gets his talent from us. - Coffee's ready! - Ah, good. Finally. Hang on! You're sitting here yapping about poems and talents... ...and I haven't found out a thing! Can you keep him if you find him? - Of course. First he has to go home to his mother... ...but then you get to keep him. - That's great! - Yes, it certainly is. Black— with— bu...shy— e...ye...br...ows Shouldn't Dad have some? - No thanks. Not for me. Niklas, come here. Would you like to be the paper's dog correspondent? We really do need one. - What does that mean? - Don't slurp. - Don't slurp. Well, it's someone who writes letters to the newspaper... ...reporting on how this dog is doing. What do you say to that? - Yes! I can do that. - You put the letters on the stairs there for me to find. Goodbye then, Mr. Dog Correspondent, and good luck! - Really, Niklas! - Bye! Pro... per...ty...of... Dog... Corr... rres... pon... dent... Ni... k...las...! Boo! Hey, Niklas! - Hi!! Who's that? - It's me. - Come down so I can talk to you. What's wrong with you? - It was something I thought was so funny. I wonder what it was. I forgot it. I always forget everything. Oh never mind. - Come on now, let's go and look for a dog. - Yes! I'm a Dog Correspondent and you can be my assistant. - Yes! - Shh! Now let's go and look for the dog. Niklas! Bilberries! Niklas! Niklas! Niklas! Niklas! What are you doing? - Looking for tracks. - You look really weird. Now I'm really starting to get hungry. Do you know what time it is? Yes, it's twelve, eleven, half ... - We'd best go home and eat. By the way, have you got something to eat in the tree? - Certainly, lots of nice acorns, spruce cones, pine cones, birch cones... -and all sorts of cones left over from winter. Spruce cones are good for intelligence, acorns give you curly hair and pine cones you can throw at the crows. - See you here in an hour. Bye! - Then we look for dogs! Dopey dogs, spotty dogs sleepy dogs, checky dogs, stripey dogs, fatty dogs! Gosh! I'm so hungry! Dad, a little spaghetti? - No thanks. Nothing floury for me. Hi - what's for lunch? - Go and wash your hands. - Exactly. What the hell is that? Who's taken the garden hose? - Johansson. - I promised him. - Did you now. Always the same thing.. It doesn't matter. - But to keep on like that— - Great! Spaghetti with meat sauce! Yes but— - Niklas ... - Oh! I've seen the admiral. - Excellent. Did you have time to talk to him too? No, he was too far away. I'm going there after lunch. I saw him with the binoculars. And then I have an assistant. The Sprite that lives in the oak. - But he is so colossally stupid. No he's not. The Sprite's so faithful and kind. We've been together four years. Niklas is right. It doesn't matter if the Sprite isn't too clever. It's good to have him around anyway. Friends should stick together. - I'm writing my first report this afternoon... ...about my meeting with the Admiral. Absolutely excellent. We're a little short of news right now. The newspaper needs correspondents like you, Niklas. - Don't make him big-headed. - Big-headed? Not at all. But the boy's been good, so he deserves the praise. Isn't that so, Niklas? -Is he a nice dog? -Is he nice? hohoho, I've never met a nicer dog... ...in all the cities I've ever been to in all my life. Definitely Hohoho - If someone found him, would he really get to keep him? - I should think so! That's your rrward for looking for him. Oh, and because you write for the newspaper. What should I call him? - Oh yes of course. I think it should be a short name. Something easy to say. Pook or Took or something like that... Mook? - No, I want a beautiful name. Tarzan or Dragon or Caesar. - Rook or Sook ... - Cecil or Joker. - Book or Poker ... - Steppy! - Nook ... Look... - Varjo! - Mr. Dog Correspondent, what kind of attitude is that? - It's my flipping dog, isn't it? - Yes, Yes. Well, at all events I'd wait 'til afternoon... ... before i get your first report. Then we'll see how things develop. Hey! Sprite! - Boo! Time to go and talk to the admiral! - Wow, what fun! I've never met an admiral... ...Do they taste good? - No, you can't eat them. - Are they fun to watch, then? - No, they're not like that at all. Shh! Calm down a bit! Remember we have to sneak up on the Admiral. If he sees us coming, he'll go off another way. Follow me. Quietly! Wait here while I go on and take a look. - Yes! - Shhh! Wake up, Sprite! Wake up! - What is it? Have you seen him? - Shhh! Yes! We have to sneak up on him from behind— -—so he won't notice anything! - Yes! We're sneaking! - Shhh! You have to be quiet, understand? - Yes! - Shhh! Come on! Yes! Good day, Admiral. Do you know anything about the runaway dog? It was you who observed the dog, wasn't it? - Shut up! These are serious matters! Don't you get it? Can we look inside your little hut? Look at this, Sprite, there was a message on the floor! "The dog was here, then he left and headed southeast." "We think he has somehow found a way over the small river." "Now he's staying in the woods on the other side." Thank you very much for the information about the dog. Ahhh stop screaming! Don't be stupid now, come and help me lift the Admiral. - No! No! - As I said, thanks very much for the information about the dog. Come on, Sprite, we'll continue the dog-search. - I didn't think admirals were like that. I thought they were funny and nice. But that you can pull them apart and put them back together ... Scary! - What's wrong? - What if someone takes me apart! - If you're so scared, it'd suit me just fine if you went home! - Scared!,Me? Hahaha! - Right, we're not worried about that any more.. - What're you doing? - Writing to Dog Editor Pudelström... ...to tell him what the admiral said about the dog. - He didn't say a word! - What do you know about it? We spoke quietly in German. - But he didn't say anything! - Didn't you see me writing in the book? That's what the admiral said! I'm far too stupid, Not good for anything. I'll jump down from the tree and kill myself. Sprite, how do you spell 'editor'? - 'Editor'? It's got seven letters! With best rewatds... ... Dog Correspondent Ni...k...las. OK yeah? - Yep, great! - Take this letter and run to my house. - Yeah! - No, hold on! Put it on the stairs with a stone on top. No wait! You need to have the letter with you! Then run back here as fast as you can! - Fast as I can! After that run down to the little river, because I'll be there. - Bye! - Don't forget to put a stone on top! What kind of person are you? - Me? - Seniorharboursuperintendentinspector. - Oh really? Senior harbour superintendent inspector? Then maybe you know why there are no lighthouses in this river. - Lighthouses? - Lighthouses, yes. Here I am sailing up this river... ...with an expensive cargo making for Söderbyn... ...and not a lighthouse in sight, so I run aground. Huh? So. Come on, Mr. Superintendent, or whatever you call yourself. Come on. There she is. There's my ship. There's my Magnolia. Full of allspice, bay leaves... ...on the way to the victualler's in Nyboda. Well, what is the harbour superintendent man going to do now? - Do? - Do, yes. Exactly. If you're a harbour superintendent and let ships run aground... ...and fail to ensure lighthouses are lit at night... ...you must make sure they are recovered. Remember that. Yes, so we try to get her to the bank. "We"? No ... The senior harbour superintendent inspector has to do all that himself. I won't lift a finger - Don't spit on my clothes... ... and I'll get Magnolia to the bank right away. - Spit? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! Behave yourself, you little ruffian! Careful, for God's sake! Hey! - Oh lay off, will you!! Nicely done! - She's scraped a bit on the side, but I can repaint her. - Oh no no. That was a good recovery job. Forgive me for being a little angry. But Magnolia is such a fine boat. There really were no lighthouses in the river. It was black as night when I came along here. Niklas! - Sprite! - Niklas! Niklas! - What sprite? - Come on! Sprite! Help! Help! Niklas, help! Help! Niklas, help! But Sprite, how did this happen? - I was running and I fell in! - - You're just puny, you are. - Do you really mean that? - Look how wet you are! Take off your trousers and hang them up to dry. -Who's he? - The captain of the Magnolia. - landlubbers. - I put the stone and the letter at the bottom of the stairs. - Right, that part's dealt with. But how are you going to get across the river? You can't swim. - Magnolia could easily take such a little scrap. If the senior harbour superintendent inspector were to jump in and swim... ...then I can take the scrap on board and sail back. -Thanks! That's really nice! They're dry now, Niklas. Come along now, boys. Do as the captain said. Hurry up, Sprite! - Niklas, I'm not just a scrap, am I? - No, you're not. Never mind what he says. - Oh good. Jump on board then, little scrap. - On that? - Yes. - Nn...oo... Niklas ... - There's nothing dangerous. It's a nice boat. - Niklas ... - Stand still in the boat, little scrap. Niklas, what are you doing? Going back in the water? - Of course, I'm going to swim over. - You can't! You'll fall in and get all wet and disappear! - Very likely. - Let's go. Stand still in the boat, little scrap! Are you going to get in the water? -Help! - There you go! Full speed ahead! Help! Help! Niklas! -Gently. -Help! Help! Niklas! There you go. Jump ashore then, little scrap. Full speed astern! Full speed ahead! Thanks so much for your help! Ehh. Just make sure there are lighthouses next time! Landlubbers! Full speed ahead! Bye! I didn't like the sailor calling me little scrap. - Imagine what you could say if he came up into your tree. - What? - You could say, "Such a big ... lump!" - Such a lump ... Such a plumpy-lump! Oww! - What is it? - That stung! The leaves are stinging! - These aren't leaves, these are pine-needles. - They really are stingy leaves!! Owww! Niklas! I was born in an oak-tree. I'm an oak-tree sprite. The stinging leaves hurt! The sprites that live in the spruce forests are different. They have much thicker skin than me! - How do you know that? - It's true! My cousin is a spruce forest sprite. He lives here with my aunt and uncle. Ouch! I 'm getting stung all the time! Can't we go home now? - What kind of sprite are you? Go home? Are you really that silly? What would happen about the dog? - My aunt and uncle live in this forest. We can ask them if they've seen the dog, can't we? - Sprite, what a great idea! You're the best sprite in the whole world. - Eh, that was really nothing. - But where do they live? We have to get hold of them somewhere. - No problem. I'll just whistle for them. They may have moved. There! ... -Good grief! - Aren't you going to say Hello to Niklas? Look what thick skin they ave! So it's you live in the forest. - Yes— . Yes, it's us who look after this forest. Yes, ever since my great-great-great-grandfather... ...came here a thousand years ago— - Two thousand years! My husband has a bad memory for numbers. Yes OK, go on! - Yes, for two thousand years we've been looking after this forest. Taken care of it and so on... one thing and another Yes ... And so on and so forth ... - Yes, my husband takes care of this forest. - My father takes care of the forest. - It's one thing after another taking care of— - Yesterday I saw a prickly fox! - Don't lie! - Ouch! Maybe it was a hedgehog. - Yes. Niklas and I are looking for a dog. - Eh? - I mean, we're out here looking for a dawg. - A dawg? - He means a dog, of course. - A dog? - A dog... - Aha... - Ah ... A black dog with bushy eyebrows? - Yes. - And black curly fur? - That's it! Exactly! - A-Ha! - Have you seen it anywhere in the woods here? - That's just what I'm beginning to wonder ... It's... it's... Hey! No more bilberries!! Get over here! Leave them alone! - I saw a lion Yesterday! - It was a dog of course, and so on and so on, that I saw last night. - Where was that? - Under the fallen tree down by the lake. - Really? - We can go down to the lake with the fallen tree... ...and see if he's still there. - Yes! - Great idea! - Yes, to see if he's still there. - It was a good idea. - Or see if he's keft any tracks. - Yes. - Yes. - And... - One thing after other... - Yes... Out of the way! As I said, in looking after this forest I take care of a little of everything ... Indeed. As I said, it's one thing after another... ... to take care of in a forest like this. - Yes I understand. - What? - I understand that. - Yes... Yes it is... Hares need to be fed ... And moose ... Yes, it's mostly spruce here ...spruce... - Wanna wrestle, eh? - No way! -I know where there's a bear! - No you don't - Yes I do! I know where there's a bear! - I don't think so. - I do know! - I don't believe you! - I really do know! - No! - Yes! - No! - Yes! - No! - Yes! - No! He's dangerous. He ate up an moose! - I don't think so! - Don't you believe what I'm telling you? - I want to go back to the others. I don't care about any bear. - Go back to the others, then! Cousin ... Cousin... Cousin... Cousin... Cousin... Cousin? Cousin? Cousin? Cousin? Cousin? Cousin? Cousin? Cousin! Niklas! Niklas! Niklas! Hello! Sprite! I'm here! Hello! Sprite! I'm here! Niklas! Niklas! I'm here, Sprite! Hello! As I said, I've always care of this forest. I've worked in many forests, but I probably enjoy this one the most. - It looks interesting to work in a forest. - Well, that's right ... Oops. It probably runs in the family a bit. By the way, it was my grandfather's grandfather who invented bilberries. - Oh, really? - Yes. But goodness! Where are they? - Who are they? - They're gone! We'd better find them right away or they'll surely get up to mischief! - The bilberries? - No, Dad. The children! - Sprite! Sprite!! Cousin! Sprite! Sprite! Junior!? Where are you, you little scamp? - Sprite? - Come here at once, etcetera! - Cousin! Cousin! Hello! Hello? You rascal! What have you been up to, eh?, - What have you been up to? - Where's your cousin? - The bear ate him all up! I couldn't stop it! - What are you talking about? - The bear has big teeth! He attacked us, tore at us with his claws and chased us! - Where is it? - Sprite was clawed! And bitten everywhere! And the blood ran and ran! I couldn't stop it! - Tell us where the bear is! - Over there! - Right! Come on! Hey you! Run! There aren't any bears in our forest, are there? - There shouldn't be, but you never know. - Hurry up! - Maybe it's just visiting. Heavens, that— There it is! Quiet! - It sounds dangerous. - Yes, that doesn't sound good. It must be a big bear. I don't think I've ever heard a bear sound like that. And so on... - I'm going to catch that bear easily! Oh dear... our little friend... Hello? - Niklas! - Sprite! That's ... Aren't you ashamed? Leave him alone. He probably regrets it. - You're a right little wretch! Now you can go and apologise to Niklas and Sprite! Quick! Sorry! I couldn't help it! - Oh don't worry about it. - Sorry, Niklas! I couldn't help it! - Oh, it doesn't matter. OK, that was nice of you really. Now let's go to the little lake. Look! There are dog tracks there. A dog's been lying here. But where could it have gone? - That's not easy to know. I just saw him lying here yesterday sleeping and so on... So then we'd best go down to the little lake and look for tracks. Can I see? - Let me have a look... ... - In any case, I can't see a dog. - Yes, here you are. - Ah yes... I'm a boat, what are you? - Nothing. Look, what a nice thing. Aw, look! Hey, come and help me grab it. Look, what a beauty! Niklas! Look! Look what Cousin has found! - Yes! - Yes, he's got his eyes open, no matter how small he is!! - This is certainly an important find. I've got lots of muscles. How many have you got? - I don't know, maybe four, five ... I have a hundred! Wanna wrestle? I can probably help ... Let me go, you devil! I only slipped! One more time! Oops, I couldn't help it. Shut up, you devil! I just stumbled! Again! - Oh! But I really couldn't help it. - You have a lot more muscle than me. It's not fair! It's not fair! What does it say? Er... "L... Lo... Log!." The log has ... The log has ... "... gum.... The log has gum." Wait ... Wait a minute, what's it say here ... The dog it says, not the log, The dog has glued ... fast. He's on ... He's on Andersson. That's what it says. Yes, it's a remarkable dog. - Yes. Come on, Sprite. We'll go to the other shore and see if the dog's there. No ... Not a good idea... and one thing and another. - Why? - Yes ... And so on. Because that's where the wild forest begins and it can be dangerous. -There are bears and tigers— - Hush now! We haven't been there... ...but we've heard that there are all sorts of dangerous and strange things there. - Well, we'll get the dog. Come on, Sprite. - No, hold on. - No no! It's getting dark now. - Yes. - When it gets dark, you won't find any dogs then. When it's with one thing and the other. It's better for you to sleep over with us tonight. If Niklas has to be on the other side of the lake... ...he might as well wait until tomorrow. What do you think? Yeah. Yes ... Here's where we live, so ... Little man, get a move on now. - Yes ... You'll be welcome, then. - Yes exactly. - Yes, make yourselves at home, go on in. - It's so nice here! And... Go ahead and sit down. - Yes have a seat. - Yes, I'm a dog Correspondent. Yes, I write for the newspaper telling them how I'm doing. - Oh? really? Is that so? I have thousands of things.- - I can beat you at wrestling. - Nah, I just fell over. Look at this, then. Look here, then! What a beauty! "Ni...k... la...s..." Are there any mailboxes here in the forest? - You can send it by air mail. - Air mail? My husband has arranged for a carrier pigeon... ...to fly here with mail every evening. - Yep. Come along and I'll show you. Yes ... Then we'll see. You... can put the letter there and so on ... So now we'll see ... I'll ... This is how I attract pigeons, you see. Yes, look. Here's one. Come on, you'll see. Now you have to pick up a letter here. There. Yes, so that's clear. Right. Suppertime! - Here you are. - Right then ... I remember one spring... It was spring ... 89. No, it was... was ... pork... No, it was spring 90. Yes, that's it. 90 it was. And I was ... surely it was 91 rather... perhaps ... Yes anyway, and so I was out ... walking... I walked up there on to the pine ridge.... I wasn't very old... and so on... And yes... Well, and so when I got there... then... so there I saw such a... a rattle... snake... A rattlesnake had come there. And well, my dad, he had told me- that when you come across a rattlesnake... ... you should walk three times round the nearest rowan-tree. Yes ... And so I went round the rowan-tree three times... -and when you do, you should say a little poem. It went like this— Hey! This is real sprite food! The father of snakes, 'mongst flowers and trees... ... Bring me some luck - make sure he flees! And then you'd go back to the rattlesnake... ...and if it was still there, you'd go straight home. So there ok... And so on... And I did. - So what happened then? - Then! Then! Everyone asks that! It didn't happen in any particular way. My husband gets so angry sometimes. It's nothing to worry about. One thing and another ... Aha! I've just remembered another quite funny story. Yes! Another funny story ... We were down by the little track, down by the lake. ...that lies right by the little track there ... ...it wasn't so long ago ... ...or else I don't remember... it was ... Spoilt kids and one thing and another and so on... - You have to forgive Sprite, he's been working hard. - Yes, I expect we're all like that. But my husband never gets tired. He can sit up for hours and hours. - Yes ... No, I really don't need to sleep very much. Yes, anyway, when would I have time to sleep? I have to take care of the forest and one thing and another... By the way, I remember once ... It must have been... 41. Yes, spring... 41. I was walking up there on Juniper Hill... And... No ... Listen, you rascal! Get to bed! No, you rascal! Now you lie still here! Sleep! You can sleep on the floor. Lie down wherever you want. - I want to sleep on the floor too! - Go to sleep now. - No! I want to sleep on the floor too! I want to!, I want to! I want to. - Yes, well, you can do that. My dear little chap. Aww, little boys. eh!. OK, I hope you can sleep well now. One and two, and one and two and one and two and ... I'm in training so I can beat Sprite at wrestling! One and two and one and two and ... Right! I've finished training! Let's wrestle now! Come on then, Sprite. We're going to wrestle! Now you have take it easy! I'm training, I'm training! ... I'm training so I can beat Sprite at wrestling! I'm going to exercise... Come on, come on, come on ... Klutta, Klutta, Klutta, Klutta ... Little elf ... little elf, come on... Come come. Here, you'll get food. Come on, then. Yes, come and get some food. I'm training so I can beat Sprite at wrestling! I'm training! I'm training! I'm training! Come on, let's sit down and grab some food. - My husband is out feeding the foxes, but he'll be back soon. We'll eat then. - Do you think it'll take long? - Don't know. - At least I can run faster than you! Hey, is that some kind of letter? Uh-huh... Is it for me? Really? Good morning and all that. - Good morning. A letter's come for Niklas. it just arrived by carrier pigeon. - Really? - Certainly. Here it is. To the Honorable Dog Correspondent, Mr. Niklas, The Forest. Dear Mr. Dog Correspondent. Thank you so much for your letters. The first one has already been printed in the newspaper. We are sorry that the message in the bottle was so indistinctly written. Instead of: 'The dog has glued fast...' ...he's at Andersson', it should say: that the dog has swum away. He is on the other side. We wish you good luck on your journey to the other side of the lake. and we look forward to your next letter. With Best Wishes, Dog Editor, M Pudelström. - Just think how wrong we got it yesterday. - I'mnot sure Niklas should go to the other side of the lake... ...and so on... - No ... Do you have to go there? I mean, with all the weird stuff out there and everything ... - No, I don't think we should go there! - But the dog! We have to look for the dog! Yes, of course, but ... And... - But if it was so dangerous on the other side the Dog Editor wouldn't be wishing us luck! - Yes... No ... - You're going? Yes, of course ... then I'll go and make some sandwiches... ...so you don't go hungry in the forest. - I want pork sandwiches! - You don't need sandwiches, You're not going to the forest. you're staying at home. - I want to go too and I want pork sandwiches! - You can go next year, when you're as strong as Sprite. I'm training, I'm training, I'm training ... - Bye then. Thanks for everything. - Bye bye. Thanks so much. One, two, one, two ... Yes Yes. And so on... - Bye then, cousin! - Bye! Promise to come back soon! Next year! Promise! - Bye bye! All the best!. Bye! Bye! Ouch! Watch where you're going! - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! - What are you yelling for? - What are you yelling for? - There's nothing wrong with you! Yes there is, it really hurts! Owwww! - What's wrong now? If you can't keep up, you might as well go home. You're just in the way! Falling and hurting yourself. Squealing like a baby! - Go your own way! I hope you don't find the dog! But you won't, because you're so mean!. I can't help it that I fell and hurt my knees! Hello, it's you. Aha, you've come with a letter. OK, Let's see... Oh dear oh dear.... Yes... It's just misery. Wait ... Konrad! - What is it? The airmail's just arrived. I think Niklas has messed things up. Dog editor, that stupid Niklas is so stupid I have left him. I'm looking for the dog myself. I'll be there with the dog soon. Respectfully, Sprite - Sprite, yes. - They've fallen out. - Niklas alone in the middle of the wild forest. - What should we do now? - Yes, what should we do? Hello, so you're back. Well, now we write a letter... ...and send it as soon as we can... ...and tell them to make up again, that's the main thing. Sprite, find Niklas right away. He's sorry if he was horrible to you. If you've been horrible to him, apologise. If you don't... then you must come home rightmediatelynow, both of you. Pudelström. Niklas. What have you been up to now? If you were horrible to Sprite, apologise to him immediately... ...otherwise you can not continue as dog Correspondent. Pudelström.

Then to the left... then right... And then on the twisty road straight ahead again. Bye-bye! Now I'm going to go and cut down some pines. Bye! Help me get out of here! Out of here? I can't tell you that. I can only tell you how to get in. By the way, I can't get out either. Now Im going to cut down some nice pines. Have you seen my fine saw? It bites well. Good morning, I was wondering if I could buy some food. Can I buy a sandwich? I'm so hungry. I'm never going to get out of here. I'll have to stay here my whole life. I'll never see home again. Tjofalleri, rifallitjo ... -Niklas! - Sprite! - Hurrah! I'm so happy!! - Sprite, Oh Sprite!! I'm sorry I was so horrible to you by the lake. - Hmph., we can forgive each other. Oh, I really like it here. You can think anything and any way you want. Nobody cares what you say. I want to live here! Not me, I want to go home! I don't want to look for the dog anymore, I feel weird Of course we'll get the dog, now that we've come this far! You stay here and I'll search. When I find the dog, I'll come back. - No! I want to go with you, otherwise I'll go crazy! Look! A dog! This isn't right. He's too tall. He's too brown. He's too fat. Hello, a dog! A dog! That wasn't the dog. He's too long. It's hopeless. There are so many dogs. There just aren't any black dogs with curly fur. - If only there was someone you could ask ... Hey ... Niklas? Are you asleep? Well. you sleep, I'm going to look for the dog myself. Poor Niklas. Hey! I'm out looking for a stray dog. May I ride you? Come on. The dog... He's too tall. Ysiad. But if you turn Ysiad around, it becomes Daisy! Daisy was the name of the dog's mother. So you're the dog's mother! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Wake up, Niklas! Wake up! - What is it? Is that really you? I had such a strange dream. I dreamed that you were out riding and found the dog's mother in a kitchen. Here! Read it! Read it! Read it! Ereh neeb sah god eht. I don't get it. - You have to read it backwards. Here, read it! Read it! - The dog has been here. He's at Niklas' house now. Hurry home and you'll find him. Greetings, Daisy. - What are you sitting there for? Hurry up! We have to get home to the dog! Hello there! It will be 100 kroner. Yes... No no, here, 200. Oh what the— 300 ... Look, there's Daisy. The Dog's mother! Hello! I'll say Hi to the Dog! Bye-bye. Hey, hey, hey then! Mum! Dad! They're back! What are you saying? - Come on, Dad. They're here! I've learned to box! I'll hit you so you fall asleep! They're back! I'm going to box with the Sprite! - No, my dear little boys! - No... they're boiling over ... - I want to join in! Hello again and so on... The soup's boiling over on the stove... They found 16 coal-black dogs! - Goodbye. Thanks for everything. - And I'm getting one of them! - Are you getting one, you little rascal? - We've found out where the dog is. - That was clever of you! - Yes, although ... - We've come from the upside-down world and the wild forest. - However did you manage that! - The dog is in Niklas' house. - Really! - If Sprite hadn't been there, we would never have got home again. - Really? Heavens! Here I am talking and the soup ... - Yes, it has probably boiled over. By the way, are you staying with us for dinner and so on? No, Sprite and I have to get home quick to the dog. - Aww, that's a pity. - With more and so on.... - But came back on Thursday. - Definitely, and we'll have the dog with us then. Come on, Sprite, let's go home. - Yes good bye. - Bye! I hope they'll come and visit. Wouldn't that be nice! Be careful, won't you? Really careful with the forest now! - Wanna box? - Eh! - Bring the dogs and we can ride through the forest tomorrow. Come back, little man, soup's waiting! See you on Thursday! When they come back, I'll show them my waterfall, and my guns. -and then we'll box and run races with each other! Come here right now, you rascal! Come on. Well, bye then. It's the Dog. He's so nice!. Hello. - Hey, Niklas. - I've found the dog now. Thank you so much for him. - My little man ... - My best little boy. - Listen ... So... do you like him then? - He's the best dog there is. Come on, old man. - I have to say Hello from the Sprite. He's too shy to come in. - Oh well then. - He really was a nice Sprite. First we were with the admiral. Then I towed Magnolia from where she'd run aground. Then we went to the spruce forest and visited the spruce forest sprites. We had eggs, ham and potatoes there. Then Sprite and his Cousin had a fight. English subtitles by jeremys and faxeholm1234 August 2020
