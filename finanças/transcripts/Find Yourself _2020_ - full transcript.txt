I think that you are a catch and very pretty. You are not spoiled like a typical only child and you're kind too. A fine lady like you should have many admirers. Why do you need to go on blind dates? Actually, I wonder about that too. Perhaps that is the reason why no one has been courting me. Talking about age might sound rude, but allow me to be frank. You're already 32 years old. I mean, I am 32 years old as well. At this age, we are no longer that young, so let's be straightforward. Straightforward? Yes, be straightforward. Just ask what you want to know. Testing each other is a waste of time. What if I were to tell you that I don't want to get married, and would like to waste time dating? I thought you'd be more anxious than I am. At your age, you are considered as an old, leftover woman. I didn't mean to belittle you. What he meant by "leftover woman" is an older woman, who is left unpicked by men. Similar to those outdated clothes on sale at the shopping mall, the leftovers in the fridge, and the buy 4, get 3 free yogurts in the supermarket, which are close to their expiration dates. After hitting 30 years old, the probability of finding love has plummeted dramatically. Time has become the most precious commodity. "Don't be so picky. Just settle down." "Look at you, you are not exactly young." Those insignificant words turned into a pair of sharp scissors and cut my pride into pieces. What others say about us is not scary. The scariest thing is when you believe it. As for those girls who don't believe it, even after they have passed 30, they are still hopeful and passionate for love and good things. They were not chosen, yet they don't choose others. They look forward to loving someone and being loved. They are glowing beings filled with warmth. They are girls with sophistication. MY RESUME Come in. Ms. He, were you looking for me? Yes. These are the resumes of the new staff. Please call them to confirm the details on their first day tomorrow. I've already indicated their staff numbers and seat arrangements. Okay. Tidy up their tables this afternoon and set up their office equipment too. There are no computers in the warehouse. The upgraded computers for the design team will arrive today. -Let them use the old ones. -Okay. RESUME There's a kid born in 1997! Why? Don't you like young colleagues? No. I won't even have an opportunity for office romance then. Two years ago, I could lie to myself by saying, "Women age like wine." But now, this old aunt can't bear to approach them. You're already acting this way at 30 years old. Then what about me? It's time to work. Hello. What's the matter? Do you have a date with Li Haomiao tonight? How did you know? How did I know? With He Canyang's big mouth, how could I not know? During the Vice Principal's birthday, he was drunk. If I hadn't stopped him, he would've sold me out. When you secretly dated my brother in high school, didn't you expect this would happen? Everyone has a dark past. If my colleagues were to find out that he was my first love, I would kill myself. At least you have a first love. I don't even have one. Should Yu and I be your bodyguards? There will surely be a 50 percent chance for you to meet a 90-kg fat man. Thank you, but don't worry about me. I'm hanging up. Ms. He, you have received a parcel. Thank you. Here. Chang Huan, this is yours. Thank you, Ms. He. I could just get it myself. I was picking mine up anyway. Otherwise, I'd have to check the list one by one. Did you stay up late last night playing games again? I stayed up to finish my design. So you were playing during the day. Any idea how high your salary deductions are for this month? Please forgive me. I won't be able to pay my house loan if I were to get another deduction. Look. I've just gotten a red bomb from our colleague in marketing. Whose is it? Zeng's. Isn't she still going on blind dates? That is old news from three months ago. Are you getting married only after dating for two months? That's a quick conquer! Congratulations! We've already registered our marriage. We just need to have the reception. Zeng, you're only 27 years old. Why are you in such a hurry? I am not. This little one is. Congratulations! Oh my goodness! Look at your efficiency. -Youngsters sure are healthy. -Stop it. You're going to be a mother! That's way too quick! I'll look bad in my dress once the bump shows. The baby has to be registered at the hospital. Nowadays, be it giving birth at the hospital or sending the kids to school, we have to prepare beforehand. After having a baby, it'll be like going on a battle. You're wrong. We've been in battles since we were born, but the battlefields keep changing. You have conquered yours in no time. I am still in a guerrilla warfare to find a rich husband. I am three years past the age of late marriage. Once women turn 25, the clock starts to tick faster. If you don't have a sense of crisis, you would turn 30 in no time. What's wrong with being 30? After my 30th birthday next month, am I going to die? You won't die when you reach 30. But to a 30-year-old on the dating market, you can't compete against a fresh graduate like Qingqing. I never said I wanted a man. Not a chance. It's fun to play with my phone and watch movies. I can travel abroad for a month every year. I feel so happy and carefree. If I don't meet a man like Sebastian, I'll never get married. What? Do you like foreigners? He's a character from a manga called Black Butler. Have you ever read it? Sebastian is such a gentleman. You just graduated, so keep on dreaming while you're still young. When you turn 30 but you're still obsessed with idols, and live in a fantasy with a brain full of unrealistic idol dramas, then prepare yourself to die alone. That's right. When you should date, don't waste your time daydreaming about mangas and pretty boys. If you were to end up like Ms. He, who has never even dated even though she is already 32, that would be the worst! No way! What a pity. Show some gratitude. Ms. He is so nice to you. I'm just saying. Truthfully, I do love our director. Among the women in this company, she's the only one older than me. You're terrible. It took you so long just to make a cup of coffee. Were you planting coffee beans? Why? Can't you stand even a few minutes without me? Of course not. The phone on your desk kept ringing, so I couldn't even draw. Don't blame your own problems on other people. Would it hurt you to answer it? No, it wouldn't. However, I didn't want to offend your client and jeopardize your success. So, should I thank you for that? You're welcome. You're welcome. Hello, this is Amazing Decoration. How may I help you? Yes, Ms. Su Li. Yes, go ahead. Don't send the raw footage yourself later. Just send an intern here to take the heat. The T-Rex is in a very bad mood that he may start blowing fire. Did his wife cheat on him? How can he have a wife with his temper? Your company's sudden footage change has already triggered the T-Rex. He was set on canceling your contract. Unfortunately, his dog went missing last night. So today is a day of disaster. He'll be a pain in the neck. What should I do? My intern is out to collect a client's contract. Anyway, as your senior, I have already reminded you. It is up to you now. All right, I'll buy you a meal one day. Goodbye. Good day, Ms. Su Li. Good morning, Mr. Ye. Morning? It no longer is. Right now, my dog should be home eating canned food. As per your instructions, all paper stands and bus stops have already been posted with notices, within a two-kilometer radius around the park where your dog went missing. -So is there still no news? -Morning, Mr. Ye. -Yes. -Great. I hope I don't have any work today. You are personally in charge of the Amazing Decoration ad. They will send us the new footage by 2 p.m. The magazines are scheduled for printing today. How can I allow them to change the photo today? This is the second time they have done this. Tell them not to send it anymore. Also, terminate the contract immediately. -You agreed to this yesterday -Morning, Mr. Ye. and decided to terminate it after this issue. Did I? I don't recall. Mr. Ye. Who brought their pet to the office? If Ms. He sees this, she will fine you for it. Did you bring it here? Ms. He. I hate hassles so the puppy isn't mine. Fine whoever brought it. The person has already been fined 200 yuan for bringing pets. Pardon? Who is it? Me. Ms. He. I have a favor to ask. Go on. I have to meet the photographer on-site today for a shoot, then send it over to the ad agency. But a client has just asked me for a meeting and I have sent out all of my interns. My hands are tied. Could you lend me an intern? But there's no intern in the administration department. Any transfer or lending of interns needs consent from Mr. Li. In the last meeting, didn't Mr. Li say that whenever he's not here, except for marketing affairs, you have the authority to decide. That may be true, but look around. Everyone is so busy with their own work. Fanxing, my hands are tied here. You are the all-powerful Ms. He to all the staff here. Please save me, Ms. He. How about Yuan Song? The design intern could spare some time. Yuan Song. Where's Yuan Song? Come in! Assistant Professor He. The sunflower symbolizes an unspoken love. Are all unspoken love as aloof as you are? Yuan Song, not all of my ex-girlfriends have attended my art appreciation class like you. Romance is the key. Fine. I have no comment on your relationship views. Why are you here today? I had a thesis review with a professor. I passed by your office, so I thought I should say hi. Why don't you have discussions on the weekends? Is it easy to ask for a leave from He Fanxing? It's not, so I didn't ask. Then you are screwed. She will definitely remember you. She promised to take care of you and help you get your internship certificate, so she will be very strict with you. Are you even twins? Your personalities are so different. If I had known she was so strict and would watch over me like a kindergarten kid, I wouldn't have my internship there. Is that so? You seem quite happy to me. If she smiled at me every day, I would be happier. You're expecting your manager to smile at you every day? What are you thinking? Back then, you begged me to introduce a company to you for your internship. But He Fanxing is in a good mood today. Maybe she'll just nag at you. I'll be honest with you. Today is the day she might change her fate with her first love. Ten years ago, she made a promise with her college classmate. If they were both still single after ten years, they would be together. Did she travel here from the past? Who would believe that? I wouldn't believe it if it were someone else. But He Fanxing is an alien while Li Haomiao is a weirdo. They are made for each other, and they can definitely make this happen. After Li Haomiao graduated, he went to the South Pole to study penguins. There are no women in their base. Is that considered true love or just a backup? It is similar to how modern celebrities freeze their eggs. It is considered as freezing their first love. That's right. Freezing their first love. How lame. You should continue. I'll drop by the club, then head to the site. All right. I'll get going. Come for a meal this weekend, we can play ball after that. Sure, see you then. One, two, three. Two, two, three. One, two, three. Two, two, three. One, two, three. Two, two, three. One, two, three. Two, two, three. Girls, left foot back, keep up with the rhythm and do it again. Okay, start all over again. Hey, is that all you know? You are so impatient when it has only been a few days. Ever heard the story of Da Vinci drawing duck eggs? No, we have only heard of him drawing chicken eggs. The small one is a chicken, while the big one is a duck. It doesn't matter which egg it is. Didn't you say there were cute boys in this club? I don't want them. Neither do I. He's so cute. Consider yourselves lucky. My partner is here. We shall dance for you, so that you won't keep questioning my abilities. Make way. Music, please. -He is so handsome. -He is! -Look, he is so handsome. -Yes, he is. Is Yuan Song not in? Yesterday, he said... he would go to school today and then head directly to the site. You are in charge of him, so you should be responsible. No leave, no clock-in. Even if he has given up on his internship, don't you want your bonus for managing him? Ms. He. Why don't you let someone else take charge of that uncontrollable teen? I don't want another pay deduction. Are you asking me to fire him? No. Yuan Song is very capable that he can design on his own. He's a rare talent. But he's like the wind. I can't contain him. You're right. The design of an intern has defeated the design of a top-notch designer. If I were you, I would have resigned and gone back to my hometown. All right. I'll deal with him. This is what we will do, Cong Xiao. I've taken the rest of the day off for some errands. I'll help you with it. That's not right. I can't let my superior run errands for me. -It'd be better if I do it-- -I'm more reliable than an intern. It's settled then. It's bad if we leave the dog out here. I'll keep it inside. Send me the address. But... Let's go. TIMESHEET YUAN SONG Hello, Ms. He. Anything I can help you with? Last month, you were late for eight times and absent twice. You're not on leave today and didn't come in, so you're absent again. According to the company regulations, if you are late for more than five times a month, -we need to have a talk. -Who's that? What a nag. She's my boss, the executive director of our company. The sister of Assistant Professor He. She's usually very nice to me, but she is very strict when it comes to work. She is very serious. Are you afraid of her? To make sure you make it to probation, I'll watch you closely this month. I'll leave first. -Bye. -Bye. Hello? Are you listening? Yes, Ms. He. I am heading to the site now. No. Come back immediately and clock in. Cong Xiao booked the photographer to be in the showroom at 11:30 a.m. As the assistant designer, I must help out with the set. I'm hanging up. Hello... If I hadn't promised He Canyang to take care of you, I wouldn't be bothered with you. Cong Xiao booked the photographer? Isn't it the same place? No! Are you kidding me? You can't tear off the happiness sticker. Ms. Zhao. When our company agreed to renovate this place with the price of a showroom, the contract stated that you can't add any decorations within three months. Also, you need to cooperate with us on client viewing and commercials filming. This is my house. Is it illegal to put on ribbons and stickers? In our family tradition, it's inauspicious to tear them off. Can't you just edit the photo? Of course, but I have to send it to the ad agency right after the shoot. Also, it's impossible to edit the photo in this condition. May I take them off and put them back later? I don't care! If anyone touches them, I won't let this rest! Ms. Zhao! Ms. Zhao, listen to me! Ms. Zhao! He's an intern and I am his superior. I should've taught him better. Let me apologize. I'm sorry. Stop pretending! Is this how you treat your clients? This is going too far! I'll complain to your boss right now! Just wait and see! Hey. Are you secretly cursing at me? Good job. What? I twisted my waist. It hurts! No one was even measuring you. Did you have to bow at a 90-degree angle? If you weren't handsome, I would've beaten you to death. "If one wishes to rectify his heart, one must first be sincere." Our ancestors said so. We must be sincere when we apologize. How old-fashioned. What did you say? I said that you are especially beautiful today. Why did you stop? Do you think that I'm a masseur? What a jerk. -If you weren't handsome, I'd-- -Baby! How did your dad find this lame firm? That wretch was obviously coming at me! Is it lame? I don't think so. It's an expensive company. Don't be mad. That's him! He tore it! -And she's an ally! -Is that so? I don't think that she's a bad person. Look, she seems friendly and she looks like my old... He Fanxing. He Fanxing! What are you doing here? Compared to seeing him with his fiancée, I'd rather meet a 90-kg fat man. Every destiny begins with the fall of a mysterious object. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... You're He Fanxing. Am I right? I know you. You have never skipped class since school began and never joined any gatherings, right? You are amazing! I would always skip class, but I never skipped any of the gatherings. INUYASHA Do you like dogs? My favorite animal is a penguin. My ambition is to be an explorer at the South Pole. I don't think you know me. My name is Li Haomiao and I think that you're quite cool. Let's be friends. I'm sure that I didn't like Li Haomiao back then, nor did I want to be his friend. Oh, no! Oh, no. Why did my brick fall? Are you sweeping? Let me help you. Here. -No! -Let me! -I'm fine! -Don't worry! Let me help you! Because Li Haomiao was a maniac. He Fanxing! Here, I bought you some manga! It's your favourite, Inuyasha. Let's go somewhere and read these. Clingy boys scare girls, -even in a friendship! -Don't go! For a long time, the existence of Li Haomiao had replaced He Canyang. We were both friends and playmates. He was also my only guy friend in college. It was a very precious memory of my youth. I couldn't help, but fall for him. He Fanxing! I'm going to the South Pole! Hey, we're having a lesson. Please leave. He Fanxing, I don't want to leave you. Promise me this. If we were still to be single after we have turned 35, can we be together? -Get together! -Get together! -Get together! -Get together! Can we? At the end of the memory, I was possessed by the female lead in a manga. I said... Sure. -Get him out! -Get together! -Get together! -He Fanxing! It's a promise! Don't forget, you've promised me! Don't you dare-- For the past ten years, I never met anyone that made my heart beat, who happened to be my long-awaited first love. That's why I've never forgotten this promise. I had also been very naive to believe that it would forever be valid. He Fanxing! I'm talking to you. Are you listening? What were you saying? I said that my fiancée is immature, but I do like that she has a willful personality. What an awful taste. Don't you think it's fate? We promised to meet at 4:30 p.m., but it's not even afternoon and yet here we are. Such an ill fate. It has been so long that you must have forgotten me. I even sent you photos back at the South Pole. After so long, you haven't changed. You are still so pretty even when you don't smile. When did you come back? About a week ago. That's not the point. The point is, once I returned, I asked the class rep for your number. Am I not sincere? Didn't you say that there isn't any female staff at your base at the South Pole? Right. You know, our team worked with a travel agency. I was the local guide and she went there to travel. I didn't know what came over me. The meaner she was, the more I liked it, the more... The more I like her. A total masochist. Enough about me. How are you? I am great. Cut it out! The class rep had already told me. He said that we're the only ones who are still single. But now, you are the only one. First, let me make it clear. Even though Li Haomiao is your director's college friend, it's not related to you at all. I will still file a complaint against you. You are quite a woman with principle. What's his name again? Li Haomiao. He lived at the South Pole for ten years and an expert who studies the ecosystem. I wouldn't believe it if it were someone else. But He Fanxing is an alien, while Li Haomiao is a weirdo. They are made for each other, and they can definitely make this happen. Are you sure someone has seen a young lady took him from Ningxia Road? Yes. A notice has already been posted at that bus stop. If she wanted to send the dog back, she should have called when she saw the notice on the signs. But she didn't, which means she didn't want to return him. Make a stamp for me. A big one. Carve the words, "Hefty reward." -Okay. -What time is it now? Half-past one. If they don't send in the new photos by 2:30 p.m., tell the magazine company to proceed. Print with the available content. Understood, I will inform Amazing Decoration. I have to take the call. Please take a look first. Hello. What? It's not delivered yet? It might be due to the traffic jam. Hold on, I'll give her a call. All the baby seals and baby penguins that we saved were adorable. They were not afraid of humans at all. You saw the photos I sent, right? Am I talking too much? You said that your palms froze to the cup, and you talked about the emperor penguin and baby seals. Yes. So did you ask me to come here to tell me these things? Of course not. There is something important that I have to tell you. Guess what this is. My wedding invitation. I am giving it to you personally. How's that for sincerity? We haven't seen each other for so long. Who knew that when we finally met, I would be receiving your wedding invitation. Congratulations. So, He Fanxing, do your best. Find someone suitable and settle down. Don't be picky just because you're pretty. Someone suitable? People around me always say that. But I didn't expect to hear those words from you. I do remember that you used to talk about dreams, somewhere far away, and a sky full of stars. You hated the word "suitable" the most. Youth is wonderful. But we are in our 30s. As humans, we have to be realistic. Do you remember what I said back in college, in the class? I told you that if we were still to be single once we have reached 35, we would be together. We would only believe that kind of thing at that age. That's true. I believed it. I kept believing it. I thought it didn't matter if I don't meet guys I like. I still had that promise at 35. It was beautiful and romantic. I thought I would have the most beautiful first love story ever. I was looking forward to it, but now I am dumped on the side of the road like an idiot. One more thing. We are getting married, but my girlfriend couldn't find a suitable bridesmaid. Check if you have the time. If you can, do help us out. Why are you still thinking about it? Aren't we friends? I can even give you a big red envelope. Just say it! Of course. Well, you were my best friend back in college. See. Since your director has agreed to be my bridesmaid, I will forgive you. I will consider it as a good deed for my wedding. Why are you here? Oh, you came here with me. It's settled now. Go back to the site. -What is it? -Are you all right? What a strange question. Why wouldn't I be? Go. -To Xian Dai Cheng, please. -Sure. Come in. Mr. Ye. This is the annual ad pitch for the airline. Please take a look. It is quite good. A new aircraft model. Bigger capacity. How much is the aircraft seller paying us that you are working so hard? Is the airline company selling aircraft? Hi, excuse me. Sorry, we're taking photos, can you wait for a moment? Face each other. Act sweet towards each other. That's right. Great. Bride, give me a big smile. I am a 32-year-old woman. But I still desire true love instead of settling for someone suitable. Am I wrong? Okay, thank you. You may go ahead now. Okay, bigger smile. This one is not bad. I am not wrong. There is no right or wrong in life. Do it again! I want to feel the type of love that makes my day just by holding each other's hands. We'll stay up all night just to talk over the phone. The type that fills my stomach with butterflies and makes my heart flutter. The type of love that makes him glow among the crowd. Like the unforgettable love that one feels at 17. It will definitely come! Definitely. Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am, is this your puppy? So adorable. So cute! It looks like Roy Wang's Dudu. Ma'am, what's the name of your poodle? I don't know. I don't know him. Ma'am. Call me, "Miss". Only high school girls can be called miss. She is already working, shouldn't we call her ma'am? She's just like my sister. She is over 30, but still obsessed with Lu Han. Is she over 30? That's so old! Yes, she has no self-respect. She bullies me all the time. Subtitle translation by Ooi Shiou Teng
