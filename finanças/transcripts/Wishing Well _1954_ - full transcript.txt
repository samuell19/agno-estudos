(dramatic music) (choir singing) (trumpet music) - Hi, you're rather glad. The same thing. (laughs) Oh, boy, I got a postcard for you too Hannah. It's from Sally Jones. She says she likes her new place. Her mistress is very good to her. She's got a nice boy working in the bakery. Her appendix is worrying her again and she'll have to have it out. Oh, and the weather is lovely. (soft instrumental music) The same thing. - Hello Amos! - Hello Betty! Did you go down to the village last night? - No, what was on? - A dance, so they tell me. The vicar was a referee. No, nothing for you today I'm afraid Betty. (sad instrumental music) (bell ringing) (children singing) (woman humming) (knocking) - Hey, hey! (knocking) (children singing) Oh, not bad. William, do you think the sang that well enough to go home? - Yes sir. - All right then, you dismiss them. - Class dismissed! - Hey, good afternoon! - Good afternoon! - What have you got on your head? - It's my new hat, it's very smart. - Oh, you're not gonna wear that for the wedding are you? - No, it's for going away. - Well, in that case it's not too bad, I suppose. - Thank you. - Oh hello David! - Hello John, Delith. - Hello David, are you coming up this evening? - I don't think so. I promised to help with wheeling the tennis court. There's not shock in there. - Always was. - We're starting the tournament next week. I was wondering? - Well, I haven't been down to the club for ages. - Oh, you want to get Delith to partner you. She used to be very good. I'm sure you'd play very well together. - Next week all being well, I'll be on my honeymoon. - Of course! - Thank you. - I'm not all together helpless, you know David. - I'm sorry John boy, just trying to be helpful you know. Fancy me forgetting about the honeymoon. (slow instrumental music) (horn blowing) - What's happening Morgan? - I don't know whether to go over or under, ma'am. - Morgan do something! - I see you brought your sandwiches. Are you staying long buddy? - No, I don't think so. Waiting for Blodwen Harris, I am. She's having trouble with her Bessie. - [Woman] Get on Bessie. You are keeping the bus waiting, look! (laughs) (sweeping orchestral music) - What's the time, John? I've got to see Bowen the baker about the wedding cake. - I'm sorry, I was miles away. - Again? - I can't help it you know, Delith. You know I'm worried about things. - So you've told me before, several times. - Let's face it, wouldn't it be more sensible for you to marry a man like David? - Much. - He's a nice chap, a good job and he's head over heels in love with you. - Well, aren't you? - Yes, but that's not the point. - Now look, David is a nice boy, I like him. But since I made up my mind ages ago that I was going to marry you-- - That was when I could walk. - John darling, let's not have this silly argument all over again. It's far too nice an evening. - But if the little things that count, Delith. I know that you can accept the obvious things, like no walking and no swimming, no tennis, no dancing. I know that you're fond enough of me to think that these things are unimportant. But life is very long and the little things will irritate, like my pipe out of reach on a mantle piece. Dozens of things! Delith, what more can I say! - You can say Delith, I love you very much. - That's true enough. - Well, then stop this chatter. Now I must see Bowen the baker about that cake. (upbeat orchestral music) - Good bye! Looking forward to seeing you again next year! Good bye! - Oh Jane, how lovely you look! - Oh yes. - I long not for a beauteous face, not yet a beauteous form, for for a heart that's tender and a love that warms. - Don't be so soft, man! Come up here and help me! (woman humming) Oh, I've been rushing about like a march chester's breakfast. - What you need is a man about the house. - So you told me. - I've always argued that if you and me was to get married, I could help you no end. - I see enough of you about the place as it is without having you for a husband. Here, help me with the sheet. - Oh, I'm fed up with being in ludyands. Mrs. Edwards, my landlady, doesn't look after me at all. She is more interested in her pigs. - Oh yes, pigs can be very fascinating, I know. - Bessie the bunt is getting married again. - Bessie always was extravagant. I've done the other rooms. I think I'll put Mrs. Amelia Smith in here. - I saw her car down the village. Long and shiny and black as the devil's heart. - Oh, I don't like the sound of her at all. (horn blaring) - Oh, I bet she's rich enough to be miserable. - You may leave the trunks. I don't know if I'll be staying. - Good day to you madame. - Oh, this is a quaint place. - I'm glad you like it. - I didn't say I liked it, I said it was quaint. - Oh, Mrs. Smith, isn't it? Come right in and welcome. - Not a page boy, surely? - Page boy? - I am a postman, madame, just a friend passing by. - But when the food is on the table, he doesn't pass. Sit you down and I'll get you a nice cup of tea. - China if you please. - Sit on the settle madame, it's much more comfortable than it looks. - Now tell me, what's all this nonsense I've heard about your wishing well. - What exactly have you heard? - That it has some extraordinary powers to grant wishes, not that I believe in such nonsense, of course. - No, no, of course not. - But a friend of mine, Arthur Bridges, the Arthur Bridges came to this place. He made a wish at the well, now he goes around telling everyone that his wish was granted. - Now yes, I remember the Arthur Bridges. He was an odd sort of a person too. - I beg your pardon. - No offense, madame, no offense. You are a widower, so Mrs. Price tells me. - My husband died three years ago. - Ah, pity, pity and you so comfortable together. - We were very fond of each other if that's what you mean. - Of course, of course, why else would people get married. Some of these youngsters, they rush into it, I know, but when people have stayed and settled down, well they know their own minds, don't they? - I was quite old enough to know my mind. - I didn't mean to say-- - My husband was able to support me in comfort. Luxury in fact. Indeed, I feel sure the arrangement would have met with your full approval mr... - Parry, Amos Parry. - Well, Mr. Parry, if your curiosity is quite satisfied, I'll go up to my room! - Have you made up your mind yet madame? - Not yet. - The kettle won't be a minute. I'll take you up to your room. I hope you'll find everything comfortable. - I hope so too! This is not the room, surely! - Oh, you'll find it as cozy as an old slipper. - That's about the size of it, too! Well, the bed's comfortable enough, what there is of it. - It's all right young man. You can bring up the luggage, she's staying! All right? - Indefinitely, I should say. Once I get in here, I shan't be able to get out! - I think she fears the cold. - Jane, the bus is stopping! Jane, the bus is stopping! - What do you expect me to do about it, then, push it on again? - Come on lovely. (bleating) - He's an old fuss pot. Oh, now let me see, let me see now. Mr. And Mrs. Jennings, isn't it? - Yes, that's right. - Welcome to you both. - Oh thank you. - Oh, you wanted twin beds, didn't you? - If you please. - Mrs. Price could fix you up with a double on the front. - I'm sure we'll be quite comfortable at the back, thank you. - Twin beds, foreigners. - There, Amos will take your bags up and by the time you've washed your hands and things I'll have a nice cup of tea ready. - Oh thank you, I'd love a cup of tea. - Oh, Indian or China? - China for me please. - I'll have China too, please. - We've only got Indian. Oh, we were expecting a Mrs. Ann Murray, wasn't she on the bus? - She got off the bus down the road. I think she preferred to walk. - We brought her case along. - I think the bus upset her. I was pretty scared myself coming up that hill. - You ought to be on it going down. This is a nice room. - Yes, isn't it. - Which bed do you want, Peter? - I don't care. - Well, I don't either. - Well, make up your mind. - Thank you. - You two just married? - No, my husband has been abroad two years. - Oh, that's a long time. A fellow will get sort of out of touch with things. - You said it. Things sort of get out of touch with a fella. - I believe you have a wishing well near here. - Yes and a wonderful well it is. You must go there to make a wish sometime. - My wife is rather superstitious, I'm afraid, but you haven't got a customer in me. - Ah, it takes all kinds to make a world, Mr. Jennings. The garden would be dull if all the roses were red. - Can't we go and see the well now, do you think? - Of course, of course. Why, the kettle is coming to the boil. - I mean, all this phony stuff about a wishing well-- - Please, Peter. Tell me, how does it work? (light twinkling music) - I don't pretend to understand, Mrs. Jennings. Bach, all I know is that it works. People come to the well to make a wish and nine times out of 10 they get it. Oh hello, Mrs. Smith. - I only came out for a breath of air. - Please, what does one do? - The usual thing. You just throw a coin into the well and make a wish. - And the bigger the contribution, the better the chance I presume. - Far as I know it doesn't make any difference. As long as the coin is silver. - How bout it Peter? - Are you crazy? Not with my money. - Then I will. (light orchestral music) - Now I suppose everything is all honey and roses, eh? - Well, anyhow it was worth trying. - What did you wish for, absent friends? - A honeymoon couple, would you say? - Oh no, just a storm in a teacup I think. What about you, Mrs. Smith, do you intent to make a wish? - Good gracious, no. - You have nothing to wish for, I suppose. - Not a thing. - Dear me, strange that is, mind you. We meet few people here that the cup of happiness is full. There are shadows in the sunniest lane. - Not in my lanes, my man. I want you to understand I don't believe in such nonsense. I am not at all superstitious. What a place to make a fuss about! Anyone would think it was Niagara Falls! - Well, what do you think of 'em? - Oh, all right. - Oh aye, very interesting, especially the rich woman. I think I can see a way for her. - Amos bach, why can't you let people stay all peaceful and quiet? You'll get us into trouble one day with this wishing well nonsense. - Well, it's worked very well so far. You, you've got 'em all fixed up, have you? - Yes, the chauffeur's gone back, so we don't have to worry about him. When John and Delith get married, I'll be able to let another room, thank goodness. - Ah, now that's a very good reason for getting married. What if you and me was to-- - Oh, don't start that again. I've slept with the hot water bottle so many years and I don't want to change my bottle. - But why don't you think of me? I can't bear a hot water bottle. - Oh Amos bah, I couldn't stand you. You'll be writing poetry about me darning your socks and singing songs every morning about the bacon and eggs. Oh don't tell me you've written another. - Well, as a matter of fact I have. A short little thing it is. I thought of it this morning when I was talking to Louis the poultry. - Well, how could you think of a poem when you're talking? - Louis was talking. - All right, out with it. You'll get into trouble using telegraph forms. - Oh tut tut. Nobody else uses them. - All right, go on. I might as well hear it first as last. - Some men may still climb on top of a hill or dive to the depths of the sea, but none can yet fly like Galark in the sky or buzzer on the bloom like a bee. Man can build a big ship, taken an airplane trip, his building go higher and wider, but can man make for me a gooseberry tree or fashion a web for a spider? - That's a sensitive line. - For we scholars and teachers and poets and preachers and writers and painters, but then we struggle and grow and push grunt and worn, we can't lay an egg like a hen. (laughs) - Very good, Amos, very good indeed. It's the-- Oh. - Oh I beg your pardon. - That's all right. Do please, go on. - I can't go any further. Thank you all the same. - Why not? - Because that is the end. - Are you Mrs. Ann Murray? Oh do come in and sit down. I'll go make you a nice cup of tea. (slow instrumental music) - Come and sit in the settle. It's much more comfortable than it looks. What did you think of our village? - Village? - You passed right through it. - Did I? I'm afraid I didn't notice. - You must have had a long journey. - Yes. - You slept, perhaps? - No, I can't sleep on a train. - Read a book then? Do you like reading? - I haven't read very much lately. Not since... - What made you come here? Have you heard about our wishing well? - Yes. - Don't you mind Amos, Mrs. Murray. He asks a lot of questions. Here, you drink that up my dear. - What was your work, Mrs. Murray, before you got married, I mean? - I was in hospital studying medicine. My husband was a doctor. - Was? - He was killed. - Ah, didn't you like it being in a hospital? - Why, yes. - Don't you want to go back to your studies? - No, no I don't think I do. - Don't you feel it would be better-- - Please, so stop asking me questions. Why does everyone ask me questions? Why can't you leave me alone? - Oh hello John bah, you're late, aren't you? - We called in Bowen in the baker to see about the cake. - He's got three tiers, enough to feed the whole of Demorgan. - Do you like my new hat? - Well, I can't say I like it as a hat. But on you, it looks lovely. Oh, this is my son, John. - Hello. - And this is Delith, she lives with us. One of the family, you might say. - I'm the one they shout for when things go wrong. - That is right. Here, let me take this. - Thanks. - All right, I'll get it for you. There you are. - Thank you. - May I go up to my room now, please? - Yes, yes of course. I'll show you up. (groans) - What's the matter? - Gout, gout. I get very nasty attacks of gout. - But just a minute ago you-- - Just help me up the stairs. Thank you, I promise not to lean too heavily. - What's the matter with you? - Gout. - Gout. - Aye, a very nasty attack, came on very suddenly. The weather has got a lot to do with it. Sometimes I'm as right as rain and then before I can say salute to wells. I'm showing Mrs. Murray to her room. It's the second on the right, Mrs. Murray. - Oh, thank you very much. - Amos Parry, in all the years I've known you, you've never had gout before. Most other things, you might mind you, but never gout. - Jane bah, I've got a marvelous idea. - So have I. Now you're going to stop this ridiculous nonsense and behave like a respectable postman. - This Mrs. Murray, plain as daylight it is. She's got no interest in anything or anybody. She's wrapped up in her own troubles, like a registered parcel. - Now you are going to leave Mrs. Murray alone. - If we could only get her to take an interest to do something. - And you get an attack of gout! - That's right, tomorrow I shan't be able to move. I feel it in my bones. I'm going to be laid up with gout and you're going to be laid up with influenza. - What? - A very bad attack. It will keep you in bed for a day or two. - Amos Parry, a foolish woman I may be, but if you think that I am going to stay in bed while you cook up some crazy plan for Mrs. Murray, you've-- - No, no, no that'll be for Mrs. Smith, the rich woman. - Mrs. Smith-- - I've got a little scheme for her too. - Well, I won't do it and that's final. Influenza indeed! You wouldn't like me to fall down and break a collarbone would you? - Well, you said you wanted somewhere quiet. Couldn't get it much quieter than this. - Maybe it'll be too quiet for you. - What did you mean by that? - Nothing. - Look, I thought we agreed that we were going to drop all this. - Oh, for Pete's sake, forget it, will ya! - Not while you keep reminding me. Absent friends! - Look, all I meant was you might find it quiet around here after London, that's all. - Without Harry Townsend and all his gay parties. - Look, look, let's get this straight. You told me there was nothing between you and him. - Nothing serious. - Okay and I said I believe ya, so let's leave it. - But you don't believe me. - Oh, drop it, will ya! - Look, what did you expect me to do while you were away two years, sit at home knitting your socks? - No, but I did expect you to be at home when I got back, not at some filthy nightclub with a-- - Have to go through all that again. I told you, I didn't get your wire. - Okay, okay, so you had a good time when I was away. - Didn't you? - Oh sure, sure, Korea was one big happy holiday camp. I went out necking every night with a commie girl sniper! - Excuse me. Have you got everything you want? - Yes, thank you. - Have we everything we want. Boy, that's a laugh. Hey, you only packed one shirt for me. - That's all I could find. - Well, there was a whole pile of them in the bottom drawer. - Pack for yourself next time. - If there is a next time. Look, Irene, I... Ah, what's the use. I'm going get a drink. - So she said she'd write a letter to the company because Jack here had given her a lot of cheek. (laughs) - Aye, she asked me to put a maggle on the bus, mind you and take it down to her daughter in Pandy. Put it on you, (speaking in foreign language) and if you'd like to bring her a bit of washing as well I'll do your smalls for you on the way down! (laughs) - Give me a beer, please. - A pint? - [Mr. Jennings] Yes, please. - Nice long leave? - 14 days, long enough. - Your wife will be pleased. - When it's over. - It's a bit of a problem of course, this splitting up of homes. Doesn't give marriage a chance to settle down. - No, no not a dog's chance. - Still, absence makes the heart grow fonder, so they say. - But who of? - Ah, well I don't know that it's a good thing for a girl to sit around and mope when her man's away. - Now look pops, I don't mind people enjoying themselves. - Fine, fine, a bit of harmless fun now and again never did anybody any harm. - Oh sure, sure, thanks. That's how it all starts, a bit of harmless fun. Then before you know what it, it's the same guy every night. Then it isn't harmless fun anymore. That's when you... Ah, what the heck am I shooting my face off to you for anyway? - People tell us things here. - They do, huh? Well, I think you'll find me shutting up like a clam. - Noisy yet? - Yes indeed. (jovial music and singing) (laughing) - You ask me anything, that young man is plain jealous. That's the trouble there. - Oh, you think so? - Sticks out a mile like Billy the barber's pole. - Ah well, maybe you're right. - Well, then you won't want to me to go to bed to cure him. - No, but we'll still need the influenza. Now you go up there bah, and develop a temperature. - Influenza my foot! What next, I'd like to know. Upstairs I go, but to wash myself. (jovial singing) - You, it's not too impleasant of a question, is there any possibility of dinner? - Well, I'm hoping it'll be served around about seven o'clock to eight. - Oh, I do hope there's no one being put out. - Come and sit down, Mrs. Smith. I'd to have a little chat with you. - And I'd to have a little chat with you. - You seem upset. - I am upset. I'm accustomed to better service. There's no water in my room and the room itself is like an icehouse and no one comes when I press the bell. - Ah, but there's a reason for that, Mrs. Smith. The bell doesn't ring when you press it. - Really? - We've had a shock and bit of bad, Mrs. Smith. Jane has been taken suddenly ill and we've had to pack her off to bed. - To bed? What does that mean, exactly? - I shall have to ask you to leave. - Leave? Are you asking me to leave? - With the greatest reluctance, ma'am. You see, we are so dependent on Jane. She runs everything here. Now, if only I had somebody like you around the place, just to sort of superintend things. I suppose it's no use thinking about it. - Oh dear, I should feel very peculiar doing housework. Very peculiar indeed! - But you have worked in your time, eh? - I spent half my life slaving for other people. - Dear me, you must have had some very trying experiences. - Exactly. Other people wait on me now. I have nothing to do but eat, sleep and enjoy myself. And I shall do all three. - And no one can blame you, madame, no one can blame you at all. But you see, that is just why I must ask you to leave. - I shall have to wait a day or two. - But my dear, madame. - I shall leave when it's convenient, mister whatever your name is, and not before! Now, I shall go and get a little air. Call me when dinner is ready my man. I don't care what it is or when it is, but call me. I imagine it should be quite an experience. (men singing) - Jane, I told you! (clanking) (groaning) (men cheerily singing) - Hello boys. - Hello Mr. Thomas! Come to give the bride groom another chance. - He won't listen to reason, Josh, as you never did. - We say that a wedding's better than a funeral any day, but not much. (laughs) - Little bit nervous, Mr. Thomas. - Everything ready for tomorrow? - Aw, don't you worry John my boy, this is not my first wedding. - No, I know it isn't, but it is mine. (laughs) Will I have a drink, by the way? - Oh thank you!

We'll manage it. - All right Amos. What have you got there? (door knocking) - Come in! - Ah, good morning John! - Hello Amos, how are you? What, do you got something there for me? - Oh, ask no question by bach and you'll hear no lies! Wait here boy, I'll do that for you. There you are. But pretty soon, you'll have Delith to do that for you. - She might as well do that as al the other things. - Oh, come, come now boy bach, that's no the way to talk for a boy who's about to get married. - When are you gonna get married, Amos? - Round about 65. - 65? - Aye, but I'll tell your mother won't have enough spirit left to say more. (laughs) - What's that? - Gout. - Oh, I see. Now what are you up to now? - It's a little schema, I might say. What do you think of it? I'm going upstairs to help Delith, you see. Your mother is whole fast in bed and she won't be able to move for a day or two. Jane, you're supposed to be in bed. - Yes, and and the guests are supposed to have their breakfast. How do you think Delith can manage by herself? - But woman! - It's all right, they're all in bed. Nobody has seen me. Good morning, son, sleep all right? - Hello Mom. - Now Jane bach, listen to me, will you? (Jane screams) - What have you got on your foot in the name of goodness! - Never you mind about that. Now you go back to your room. - I don't know what this place is coming to, no indeed. There. Are you feeling a little bit better about things this morning, son? - No, I can't say that I am. Now don't fuss Mother, please. - Oh there, there. Most men feel a little edgy before getting married. I can remember when your poor father was getting married to me. He broke out in a rash! (laughs) - Jane! - All right, don't get pom. - I don't think easy about it, you see. Maybe all right now, what about later on? Anyway, I'm worried. - I know and the morning's the worse time of all to be worried about things. Here, now have your breakfast and you'll feel better. - Jane, come on up now when there's a chance. (sighs) - I don't know, what to now. I'm not gonna do it. (Jane screaming) - Oh, Jane is getting feverish. - What does one do for breakfast around this place, go out to graze? - Oh, things are very difficult, Mrs. Smith, with Jane so bad and me almost a cripple. I feel like, like a fish out of water! - You look like one too. - Now you run along marry, I know you've got a lot to do for your wedding. I'll bring up Jane's tray later. - Thank you Amos bah, I don't know how I'll get everything ready in time. (door clacking) - Good morning Mr. Parry! - Ah, good morning Mrs. Jennings! - Thank you. - Thank you. - Amos, Amos! (door knocking) (whimsical orchestral music) - There you are, have a a good time. - Ah, good morning Mrs. Murray. You going for a walk? - Yes. - You're not going down to the village by any chance? - No, I'm not. - Oh, I'm sure I don't know how I'm gonna deliver my letters. I can't move an inch with old gout. - So you mean to keep it warm. - Oh, it's shoggin' painful when I put it onto the floor. - Yes, I dare say. - If you can only get the letters up here, perhaps we could manage. I'm sure Mrs. Watkins the post will give them to you. - To me? But I don't even know where the post office is. - Wait, wait, I'll show you. If you go straight down that path through the village, it's the second shop on the left. - Yes, well I'm afraid you'll have to find someone else. - Wait, wait, look, look, look you see that little house on the side of the hill? Now there's an interesting house for you. Mary Lewis lives there. She'll open the door, you'll get to it. No need to knock. Her little man is on his back in the sanatorium and every Thursday there's a letter and Mary thanks you for it, like for do herself. - Well, that can hardly be of interest to me, can it? - Ah, but that's where you're wrong, Mrs. Murray bach. There's plenty of interest if you choose to look. It's madness to watch how different people behave in a different way. Every letter a story, laughing or crying in every one of them. (birds chirping) - Not bad. - This smoky pearl. Remind me to take them off before we go climbing. They cost a small fortune. - Present from somewhere? - Will you do me up? - Irene? - Yes darling? - What's gone wrong with us? - I don't know. It's you, you've changed. You used to be so much fun, now... - Fun, fun, that's all you seem to think of! Well, why don't you get back to that Townsend character because I've forgotten how! - Hey, you forgot your pipe! (door clacking) (crying) - Good morning. - Why, hello. Hey, what's wrong with the foot? - Gout. - Gout? - Just a little scheme of mine for the benefit of Mrs. Murray. - Don't tell me she's out delivering your letters for you. - No, I can't say for certain, but I sown the seeds and now I'm waiting for the harvest. Devil of a mess in the kitchen. - Well now, I will whip up a big of Yorkshire pudding while you can wash up those few dishes. - Well, why not. - Now, first take two eggs. - I could think of a better way of spending a 14 days leave. - Next, sift the flour. She took a bit of persuading mind you. - Who did? - Mrs. Murray. Do you what it is when people let themselves go? - No, I don't. I mind my own business. - Ah well, I like lookin' into people. In the main they are silly and vain, but I like lookin' into 'em. - Don't tell me all this is the name of someone too. - Well, we'll see boy, we'll see. - Look, how long's this sort of thing go on, anyway? - Oh, it won't be long. No more than a day or two, I shouldn't think. With you, I'll put in the milk. That oughta settle the rest of it. Ah, yes things are not gonna be very comfortable around here without Jane. We'll miss her, mind. It's nice to see an old face walking about. - Look, if there's anything else you want, just let me know. - Well, you don't want dirty pudding, do you? - No, but I'd like to have a head start on you, that's all. - Ah, this is gonna be a bit watery, I'm afraid. - Why don't you ask Mrs. Price, she's only upstairs. - What? Go to her bedroom? - Sure, why not, something wrong with that? - Oh yes, that wouldn't be proper. Jane is not the type of woman to show her nightdress. Not until she's married, I mean. I never even thought about her in a nightdress. She doesn't seem to be the type of woman to have a nightdress. Not to show, I mean. - Ah! (steps clattering) - Seemed a bit too sloppy. I'll try another egg. - Taste that! - Salt. - Yes, and that's what you put in my tea! - Now, well if you'll wait a minute, Mrs. Smith, I'll make you a fresh cup. - What are you trying to do, break it or frighten it? - Ah, this is a very delicate operation, Mrs. Smith. Bach, you'd never understand. (tapping) - Ah, now look what you've done! Argh! (dishes clattering) (laughing) Oh go on, I'll beat you two! (men laughing) - Hey, that's a good place to get thrown out of, huh? - What was that noise? - Jane what are you doing down here? - Looking for food! - But Jane bach, they'll see you. - They'll have to be mighty quick. Another two hours and I'd be a skeleton. - Yes, I forgot all about your food. Run back at once Jane bach, and I'll send Delith up with something as soon as she comes in. - I'm staying here until I'm fed. - But Jane bach, what if somebody comes in? - I don't care a tinker's cuss. I've been stuck in that blinking room like a nun! I've read the Sunday Companion down to the adverts and I know the farmer and stuck breeder off by at. (woman singing) - There, doesn't that gladden your heart? - Maybe it does, but it doesn't fill my stomach. What's she doing in my kitchen? - Working, of course. - What? You don't mean to say that she? Where's Mrs. Murray then? - Out on my rounds. - What? - She wasn't easy to persuade, mind you. "This can hardly be of any interest to me," she said. But I told her, "Ha, ha, that's where "you're wrong Mrs. Murray." I said, "There's plenty of interest if you choose "to look for it." it's marvelous to watch how different people behave in a different way. Every letter is a story. Laughing or crying in every one of them. There's old Mrs. Roberts at the cross. She makes you sit down and she'll read her letter to you. I've done this so many times, I know it off by heart. Dear mum, just a few lines hoping you are quite well, as this leaves us a present until thank you for the parcel. Janet and the baby are both well. I'm hoping to see you again soon, love Jack. May sound silly to you, but what could you do with old people? The same, every week, just like a rubber stamp. But it is the voice of a loved one and the words are written in gold. Further up the hill there's a cottage on the corner. Mary Lewis lives there. She opens the door as I get to it, no need to knock. Her little man is on his back in the sanatorium and every Thursday there's a letter. Mary's (voice cuts out). Like it was written to herself. I've done that before now, too. (soft instrumental music) But there are some you couldn't deceive and others you wouldn't deceive if you could. Nancy Morris is the one. Every day she watches. Every time I pass she is there, just waiting for the letter. (dramatic music) Her little man is reported missing. Just missing, that's all and Nancy won't believe that he's killed. But every day she waits for a letter which never comes. She's just waiting, waiting, waiting. Not interesting delivering letters, Mrs. Murray. (dramatic orchestral music) - This Nancy Morris, how long has she been waiting for her letter? - A good many years, why? - Seems such a wicked waste. - Hello, my dear. - I thought you were ill. - Well, I will be if I'm kept without food much longer. - You see, Jane is not ill at all. - Not yet. - She's just pretending to be ill. It's for the benefit of Mrs. Smith. - You see, it's all to do with this old wishing well, my dear. - Mrs. Smith is a rich woman, but a very unhappy one and she's not used to a nice life. - We think she might be a cook or a barmaid. - Sure, if we can get her to do something, it might make her realize that she'll never be happy doing nothing. - I see. - Maybe I'm an old folkin', old busy body, but I sort of like to peep into people's problems. We're all in this together. - To be sure. I'm not staying in bed for a treat, I can tell you. - Ha, ha, you're a fine latt! I don't suppose you thought about poor Mrs. Price upstairs starving to death! I'm gonna take her up some food! - Oh Mrs. Smith, now Mrs. Murray is going upstairs and she'll take it up for you. - Oh, thank you Mrs. Murray. I'm rather busy. You're gonna be lucky today, you're gonna have some dinner. I'm gonna do it all by myself. - There, you nearly spoiled everything! Go back to your room! - But Amos, I have been lying on my back till I could blister! - The rest'll do you good, go on! - It's so lonely. - Tut, tut, it's only for a day or two! - Well, come up and talk to me, Amos. You're not much to look at, but I'd rather look at you than the old wardrobe, worn that though it is. - The food, the food, you've forgotten the food! - Oh! - I see. - Oh, Amos's foot, well it's... Much better this afternoon. - Mrs. Price, please. - Now you have put your foot in it. - Why me? I haven't been to your wishing well. Why make your silly plans for me? - Well, Amos doesn't like to see anyone unhappy. - Then I'm afraid I shall be one of his failures. - We never can tell. - I know you mean well, but do you think I haven't tried too? Oh, I've tried working before. I even went back into the hospital and tried to take up medical work again. But every memory hurts so. And yet, I've never shed a tear for my husband. Not one single tear. Can you understand that? No, of course you can't. Can't even understand it myself. But I'm not going to get any better through any silly plans of yours, so please leave me alone. - Mom! What's all this nonsense I hear about Bowen the baker pushing me to the wedding? - Well, I thought it would look nice boy bach. He's such a lovely looking old man and when he's dressed up-- - Why don't you call out the Boy Scouts! They could pull me down there with colored ropes or what not the local ambulance too, a stretcher. (sad orchestral music) - Oh, now don't upset yourself. You wait, I'll go and talk to him. - Why don't you leave him alone! How do you expect the boy to get any confidence in himself if you molly coddle him? You people! You're all so busy poking your noses into other's affairs, you don't seem to realize that your biggest problem is right here, on your own doorstep! (sad orchestral music) (fun orchestral music) - Do you think we'll have enough? - I should hope so! Thank you dear, you've done lovely! Hello my boy. - Hello Mom. - You'll find everything ready. - Thank you. - Is there anything more I can do for you? - No, thank you. - You know, I'd only be too glad if you-- - No, thank you, I think you've done enough for me already. - What do you mean by that? - Nothing, except that I think it's about time I started doing things for myself. - Of course, John bach, but how on earth can you? - Look Mother, I don't want to argue about it today. - Ah Jane bach, fair lovely you look! - Thank you. Yes, I can put on the glamor when it suits. Doesn't it look lovely! - Aye, enough for two. It ought to be a double wedding. - Anymore of this excitement, and you'll be burying me, not marrying me. - Excuse me, could I have my bill, please? - You're not leaving us? - Yes, yes, I'm afraid so. - But I haven't got a bill for you, Mr. Jennings. You book for a fortnight. - Well, my wife will stay on a little while, I think. - Are you leaving without Mrs. Jennings? - Yes, yes, I'm afraid so. It's something I have to see to. My wife will probably stay on a couple days, she'll let you know. - Couldn't you come back after you? - No, no, just let me have my bill if you please. I'll be in the bar. Give me a large whiskey, please. - Sorry to see you going to soon boyo. - I'm glad somebody is. - Going back to your squadron, perhaps? - No, no, I've had just about as much as I can take, that's all. - Well, I can't say that I blame you. Your wife has got no interest in home life, that's the trouble. You'll pardon my please speaking, would you. - Well, I guess we're both a little to blame. - Oh, I wouldn't say that. You seem to be a reasonable enough fella, always willing to give a hand. - I thought I ordered a large whiskey. - Only this afternoon I was telling Mrs. Murray how sorry I felt for you. - Oh, well anyway, what's the use of having a home if you're always away from it? Then when you do come back you find that-- - Go on, go on say it. You can't live in a house all by yourself and your wife would prefer to live in a dance hall. - I can't see that it's any of your business. - I can't help putting two and two together. - Yeah, and getting five. - Gallivanting around the town when you're fighting for your country! - Well, I didn't do so badly. - And if that wasn't enough, just go running around with another fella! - Wait a minute, wait a minute, what my wife does is my affair, see! - Oh now wait, you can't blame me for thinking about your wife the same as you do yourself. - Well, you just leave the thinking to me. That happens to be my privilege. I married her, you didn't. - What's the matter with him? - I can't say. I was just passing the time of day, all pleasant like, and he shot my head off. - You too? Give me a large gin, please, nevermind about the tonic. - Aye, he's a very difficult man to get on with, is your husband. Only this afternoon I was telling Mrs. Murray how sorry I felt for you. - Really? I didn't know people were taking that much interest in me. - Oh, one can't help taking an interest in a dog that's been badly treated. - I thought I ordered gin. - That'll do you more good. Yes, he's a very conceited chap, your man. - Well, I wouldn't say that. - Oh, that's right, you defend him, I admire you for it. - I don't want to defend him, but he's not conceited. - Well, selfish then. - It's not his fault, it's that damn war. - Ah yes, I know how it is with these young fellas when they leave home. Some of them can't be trusted beyond the front doorstep. - I didn't exactly go into a nunnery myself. - Well, who could blame you, when you knew that your husband was popping around like a fly in the night. - At first, I never went anywhere. I just sat around that empty flat, worrying myself sick about him. Then one day when I couldn't stand it any longer, somebody asked me out and I went and I kept on going. Well, that way I didn't have time to worry about Peter. Now you know the whole story. Satisfied? - I can't help feeling sorry when devotion goes unrewarded. - But I wasn't devoted. Maybe if I had been-- - Why are you so unhappy, why so sad? - It's both of us, we get on each other's nerves. - He doesn't consider you at all! No man has a right to marry a girl if he doesn't lover her. - Peter did love me. - Then why has he changed? Why have you changed? - I don't know. - You haven't changed. You'll just go on loving him until you die. You'll just sit back watching him grow colder and colder, running around with other women. - He doesn't, he doesn't! How dare you say such a thing! How dare you criticize my husband! - It's only because I feel sorry for you. - I don't want you to feel sorry for me. It's just as much my fault as Peter's that we can't get on! But he's no conceited, he's not selfish and he certainly isn't loose! - Now see here, you. The sooner you stop pushing your snoot into our affairs the better I'll like it, see. This happens to be a private affair between my wife and me and we'll work it out ourselves or not at all. And we certainly don't need any help from nosy busy bodies. You just stay out of our way, buster! - I second that. - Sorry I spoke. - Amos, Amos! - All right, here I am! - Well come on, it's time for you to fetch Delith. - All right, all right, I'll be there, I'll be there. (majestic instrumental music) - Thank you. (airy orchestral music) - There now merchid, I think that's right. - Good of you to go to all this trouble, Mary. - Oh well, indeed, I was too happy to have you. Couldn't have done for the bride to be married as the same house as the bridegroom. (sweeping orchestral music) - I wonder where Amos Parry is! - Tut, tut it's the day, must be on time. (door knocks) (organ music) (low chattering) (birds chirping) - Listen darling, that's the tune they played at our wedding. - Did he kiss you like that? - Peter! (organ music) - Thank you David boy. I'll take it myself. Thank you very much, I'd rather do it myself. (organ music) (screaming) - [Woman] John! John, John, John! - I'll help you John boy! - Doesn't this prove it? I knew that we can't go through with it! - John, oh John! - I told you to leave me alone, leave me alone, all of you! (cries) (soft orchestral music) - [Amos] Morning John! - Hello Amos. - One for you, boyo! Di Dinkins' handwriting. - Thank you. (soft orchestral music) - Hello Robin. Bessie seems a bit reluctant today. - Oh thank you. Yeah, she couldn't be a bit ugly a thing or time, but she's lovely company. (bleating) Who's this from, I wonder? - I don't know, strange writing to me, whatever. - Good morning, John. - Good morning. Thank you. (sad orchestral music) - I'm afraid the egg is hard. - Oh, it's all right. - Nothing else? - I think we ought to pay Mrs. Price for our second week. - You don't have to tell me what I ought to do. Eh, what time does that bus get here, anyway? - I'm afraid you'll have to put up with me for another 35 minutes. - That's just about as much as I can take, baby. That's mine, I think. - Sorry. - Well, it didn't work out so well, did it? Wishing well or no wishing well. - How could it? You'd already made up your mind that it wouldn't. - Maybe this place is wrong. Maybe we should have gone somewhere where there was plenty of fun. - It's not the place, it's in your mind and you'll carry it around with you wherever you go. - Irene, Irene are we really through, washed up? - That's up to you. I've done all I can do. - Well, look, look, maybe if we hung around here for a couple more days we could really iron the whole thing out. - I've already packed. - This place seems to have done you a bit of good. You're looking much better. - Yes. Yes, I've been feeling quite different. - Why is that, I wonder? - Who knows. Maybe it's because I've been taking an interest in other people. Maybe because I've cried a little. Maybe because I've seen Nancy Morris. - The things that they must think soft are beyond me. - Have you ever been to the wishing well? - I have only one wish in life Mrs. Murray, and the well can't help me with that. - You mean John. - Yes. Have you ever heard of functional paralysis? - Yes, I have. But I don't know what it means. - It means paralysis due to mental rather than physical weakness. - Are you suggesting there's something wrong with my boy's head? - That's putting it crudely. - But that's what you mean. - The doctor said John would walk again. It's my belief that he's got a conviction that he can't walk. - The doctor said he might walk in time. - No, they said he could and would. There was no might. - Mrs. Murray, if I thought there was a cure for him, I'd go to the ends of the earth to find it. - We must help him to regain confidence in himself. Make him believe that a cure is possible. Get him to try to walk, just one step would do. - Yes, like Amelia, wiping the dishes. - Good morning Mrs. Price. Could I have my bill now, please. - Morning Jane. - I'm so sorry you're leaving. - I'd like to pay for the full two weeks, Mrs. Price. - On no, boy bach. - I insist. - Good morning. - Good morning Mrs. Jennings! - Good morning. - Good morning Mr. Jennings, nice morning! - Oh Amos, I found the letter, the one I was telling you about. - Ah good, I'd like to hear it. - Well, I-- - Oh go on, go on, I'm sure Mr. and Mrs. Jennings won't mind. - It's a letter I received from my husband, a day or two before he was killed. I was telling Mr. Parry about it, but I don't think that-- - You carry on, Mrs. Murray, we don't mind. - Well, there's a lot of interesting description then he says, "Life is so matter of fact "and I doubt if we ever realized how much we meant "to each other before this war dragged us apart. "The simple things are the precious things. "But we're all so blind to the beauty of the common place. "Well, my dear, my eyes are opened. "These little things I always took for granted, "assume great importance to me now. "When I come back, "I shall make every moment count. "I thank God for you, my dearest." There's more of course. - [Amos] And he didn't come back. - No. - It's a very interesting letter. Don't you think so, Mrs. Jennings? (sad orchestral music) (tinkling orchestral music) - Well, leave the bags for a minute. I shall have to hurry back and clean their room. - No need Jane, no need at all. We'll put them in the double room in the front. - Good morning. - Oh hello, boyo! - Good morning. Mrs. Amelia Smith sent for me. - Is she leaving or something? - I think so. - When did she send for you? - Oh, a couple of days ago but I was overhauling the car. - You'll have a waste journey. - Well, it won't be a wasted journey, I wanted to see her anyhow. I want to give her my notice. - Notice, why? - Because I'm fed up. - Something wrong boyo? - Ah, everything. - Been driving long? - Yes, I learned in the Army, southwest Borderers. - What were you before that? - Unemployed, of course. - No, I mean before that. - A collier. - Oh, well, driving a posh car is a bit of a change from cutting coal. - Well, I was looking for a snip, you know, something easy. - Driving for Amelia should be snippy enough. - Too snippy. - Don't mind Mr. Parry. He's always asking questions. - That's all right, he can ask as many questions as he likes. But look, if this is one of those psychiatric stunts, don't waste your time. I happen to know just what's wrong with this chicken. - Oh, you do, do you? - Aye, it's all very simple. You see, all my life I've been a sort of fighter. And now, well, I'm just a lady's maid and general flunky to Amelia. Car's a grand job, but not much to do. She's not a bad boss, good pay, and plenty of time to yourself. I'm fed up to the blasted teeth. - Oh, and what are you looking for now? - A job where I can use my hands. - And use your brains, eh? - Damn, I never had much of those anyhow. - Well, you better tell Mrs. Smith, she's upstairs. - Thank you very much. - What do you really think of Amelia, Mrs. Smith, I mean? - Down at the bottom, not bad at all. It's a question of how do you knock off the muck to get at the core. - I see what you mean. - As it is, she spends all her time thinking of how to spend her money and dressing up in furs and jewels, which never seem to suit her anyhow. (door knocking) - Come in! (singing) - Oh Pete. - Well, Marvin, what do you want? - You sent for me, ma'am. - Well I've changed my mind, I'm busy. - If you don't mind ma'am, I'd like to talk to you anyhow. - Well, get on with it. - I want to give you my notice. - Notice? - I hope you don't think I'm being ungrateful ma'am, but-- - Don't be silly. That'll suit me fine. I shall miss you, my boy, you know your job. But you can leave the car here and I'll give you three months wages. (laughs) I always did want to drive the thing myself anyhow. (singing) - Have you finished, Jane? - Oh yes, I'm almost ready to go. - Well, before you go, there's something I want to say. - Oh Amos, why do you keep on with the same old thing? Of course I like you, I always have. I just don't want to marry you, that's all. - But it would be the most sensible thing to do. You're a lonely woman and I'm a lonely man. I don't see why we should stay apart and be lonely all our lives. - You think we should get married and be lonely together? - Be reasonable, woman. - I told you before, we're past the age, both of us. - But I don't think so. - Well, a girl's a bit choosy up until she's 25. From there to 35, she'll jump at any reasonable offer. But when you've been a widow for as many years as I have, well, there's a lot to be said for a bed of your own. - Jane, why don't you listen to me? - I tell you, I got acclimatized. - But I am not acclimatized. I feel the call of spring. - Amos, a man of your age, talking so flippant. And inside a chapel too! - You keep me at arm's length. You're afraid to admit that you've got human urges. - Human urges! - Yes, if you'd only let me get close to you for once, you'd feel that I am a kindred spirit. - What I can feel at this moment, is my basket sticking in my stomach. (laughs) - I'd never have believed it, never. "Leave the car here Morgan," she said. "I've always wanted to drive it myself." Some hope of her doing that. (tires squealing) Well, it was a good car. (clattering) (Amelia singing) - Oh, see you later! - Where is everybody? - They're all out, except me. - I've had a letter from Di Jenkins. He's going to Canada, you know. Mrs. Jenkins is there already. David Myles has bought his farm. - Good for David. - Would you like to life on a farm, Delith? - I think so. - Well, then you should marry David. - Maybe I will someday. - What an odd pair you are. - Why odd, Mrs. Murray? - Well, you seem to spend so much time trying to shape other people's lives and yet do nothing about shaping your own. - We don't go to the wishing well, you know. - Then you should. - If this is an introduction to a lecture, Mrs. Murray, you're wasting your time. I have heard about as much as I want to of this wedding business. I shall remember the whole sorry mess for the rest of my life. That little affair at the chapel wasn't just an accident, you know. It was conclusive proof that it was all wrong for Delith to get mixed up with a man like me. She'd spend her whole life arranging things to fit in with my legs. I'm afraid of myself, you see. I know that I'd be watching for some sign of irritation. Some sign of annoyance. And if I couldn't see it, I'd imagine it! - What have you to say that, Delith? - I love him. - I wish I could make somebody understand. - But I understand perfectly. It's often easy to become reconciled to martyrdom. - I am not reconciled to martyrdom. - You have all the symptoms. - You don't know what you're talking about. - Even when the doctors told you you could walk, you wouldn't believe them. - I can't walk! - You've made up your mind that you can't. But there's nothing radically wrong with your legs. - But Mrs. Murray, he's paralyzed. - He thinks he is. - I think I am! Go to hell! Do you imagine that I enjoy spending my life in this damn chair! - Well, I've never seen you try to get out of it. - The rubbish that you talk. - I won't let you talk to him like this, I won't! - But I've seen the medical reports. - The doctors only heal the wounds. - [Mrs. Murray] So there's nothing else to heal. - It's the muscles! - They were treated. - The nerves are all gone. - They were treated too. - But he can't even move his legs. - [Mrs. Murray] When did he last try? - Mrs. Murray, I think you're wicked. - [Mrs. Murray] I believe John could walk if he tried. - Mrs. Murray, you've been here only a very short time and you've formed conclusions after reading a silly medical report. I've nursed John ever since they've brought him home and I know that if there was anything he could do he would have done it. But to suggest that he's, he's sitting there like a mummy just for the sake of trying to walk is the maddest thing I've ever heard! I think you're a very wicked woman! Oh my dear. - Not trying! Does she think that I like to sit here, day after day in this damned thing? - Oh John! - Hello there. Isn't there anybody serving drinks around here? - Well, it's closing time. - Too bad, I'm as dry as dust. - You look as though you've had enough already. - Don't you believe that buddy. - You must have come to see Mrs. Smith. Well, I'll see if she's upstairs. - No rush for me, baby. She's out driving the car. - [John] Hey! - Please, you're being silly! Let go and I'll see if she's come back! - First you'll see Mrs. Smith-- - So damn stupid! - John! - Delith! - John! - Mrs. Murray! Mrs. Murray! Woman! - [Delith] John! (groaning) - It's the last time you'll slap my face. - John! John! (dramatic orchestral music) John, you are standing, you are standing! - Are you all right? - Yes, get up again! - I can't! - You must try! - I can't. - Mrs. Murray he was standing, he was standing on his own two feet! - Yes, my dear, I know. John, are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right. Don't worry, it's the first step that mattered. Now that you've started, with treatment and the will to walk it'll be no time at all before you're on your feet for good. (sweeping orchestral music) (groaning) (choir singing)
