[devotional chants] Oh, the lord of the heavens! In the future… Everyone should stay healthy, wealthy, and live a life free of discrimination! Bless our lives! Om Namo Narayana! [bell rings] Hema… Hema… I'll be there in a minute! I just got back from the temple… Here's the offering… Uncle? Coffee. Thanks. -Hema… -Yes, tell me! Hand me a towel. How can someone forget it every day? It's become a habit! I go to work, too! Can't you do these simple tasks by yourself? I don't know why, but I feel like I've showered only if you hand over the towel! -Stop talking rubbish! -Why don't you step inside? -Uncle's here… hush up! -Oh, no! Here, take your bag. -Give it -Hand me that bag! Here… Uncle… I've kept vathal kozhambu and karamadhu for your lunch. Why did you cook so much? I'm fine with just rasam! You're fine with it, but he isn't! -Hey, Srinivasa… -Dad? She goes to work, just like you do! -Why do you trouble her so much? -Enough, Dad! Times have changed for the worst! Make sure you lock the doors tight! Come… Is this the way a policeman speaks? So, what if I'm a policeman? I can only solve crimes after they've occurred! But the responsibility to prevent crimes lies with us! Let's get going, we don't have time… [engine starts] Keep an eye on the road! -Huh? -My father brought this vehicle for us with love! Why are you including me by saying "us"? You can say that this vehicle is for dropping you off and picking you up! -Okay, I'll see you! Bye! -Hema… Hey… Hey! You always blame me for being forgetful, but you're forgetting your lunch! -I forgot it just once… give it to me! -Here. You've forgotten to wear your ID card, yet you blame me. I'll put it on now! -Good morning, sir! -Morning! -Good morning, sir! -Morning! [phone rings] They're saying complaint number 5838 hasn't been forwarded from Triplicane station, sir! Message receiving, sir! -Which precinct are you calling from? -Chepauk, sir. -Hello, Mukundan! -Sir! Yesterday… at the Pazhavanthagal subway… there was a call about a chain snatching and murder… -Yes, sir. -Did they take any action on the complaint? Sir, passing on the message is our job… It's not our job to check if action has been taken on a complaint… It's a mistake to ignore it as out of our scope… We're not some computer operator or a supervisor… We're all in the police department… -Sir… -And we have some responsibilities! -Sir… -Who's the deputy commissioner of that precinct? -Okay, ma'am… -Adithya, sir! -Adithya, sir! -Thank you for calling the police control room. -Srinivasan sir! -What is it? Mukundan sir is right about this. There was an unknown call, last month informing that there was a bomb at the commissioner's office! Mukundan sir was the one who attended that call! We alerted everyone! But he got reprimanded as a result… [laughs] [phone rings] Hello! The police are your friends… This is the Chennai city police control room… -How can we help you? -Sir…sir… I've got to tell you something really important… -Are your senior officers present? Please… -Sir! This isn't a police station but the police control room. Our job is to make sure your complaint reaches the relevant department… Tell us your complaint without any hesitation… Sir, you don't understand the seriousness of this situation! I don't require your help. There's a lady all alone, in danger and she's about to die soon! About to die? Wait…Wait…Wait… Sir! Hello… Talk to me, sir. What is your name? Where are you calling from? Don't waste time by asking the usual questions! This place looks like Adyar! There are trees surrounding the house. It appears to be a brick house… The lady in that house is all alone… She's in danger! -And she's going to die in some time! -Sir…Sir! -How are you related to the lady? -Save her, please! [dial tone] Mukundan sir, he's calling from Gummidipoondi and talking about some death in Adyar? It sounded like he was trying to get you in trouble! He's talking about coconut trees, teak trees… He's spinning colorful tales! He didn't give his name or his location… Nor did he mention how they'd die or any of that nonsense! I guess he wants us to find a needle in a haystack! -Yes, sir! -Even if we called Adyar station… and told them someone is going to die in a house surrounded by trees… Wouldn't they mock the work we do at the control room? -Mukundan sir… -Yes… This is like that hoax bomb call… Don't get caught in the trap this time too! Hello! The police are your friends… Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation's financial status… has been described in the electricity department's… [doorbell rings] Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation's total revenue for the year 2020-2021… [indiscernable TV news plays] Ma'am… -Tell me, Kumar. -Ma'am… My wife has been taken to the hospital… Her amniotic sac is broken! They're saying she needs to have a cesarian done. I'll be back soon, ma'am… Is it? I'll be all alone! Had you informed me earlier, I could've asked Dhanam to stay back. Fine… -Take care. -Thanks, ma'am. -Make sure you lock the door, ma'am. -Okay. I'll be back soon. [news announcer] …Average price was-- In Chennai, a woman was found murdered, having her throat slit, in her locked home. North Indian dacoits broke into her secluded bungalow in Neelangarai, near Thiruvanmiyur… And slit the throat of the woman who was staying alone… -[phone rings] -Jewels and high value items in the house were stolen… …have been captured on CCTV cameras. Are you already asleep, Mom? -Don't ask! I'm all alone… -Why? The security guard's wife is not well, he has gone to the hospital. That's alright! Even if the security guard leaves… I'll keep an eye on the CCTV from here, don't worry! That's fine, did you go through the medical report I sent? Yes. Everything seems normal. You rest well without a worry! Don't forget to take your medicines on time! Okay? I'll hang up now. I'm getting late for work… You take care of your health. [doorbell rings] -The pudhina chutney tastes amazing! -Do you like it? [news announcer] Breaking news… Finding a woman dead is breaking news, these days! -Why are you playing this news… -A woman was found dead… in her locked home at Adyar. Yesterday, a mystery man called to inform the police control room and our channel about a woman's death in Adyar. The woman's death in Adyar, as predicted by the mystery man has caused a stir among the police department and the public! What happened? Why are you getting up without finishing your food? No… I'll eat once I'm back from work. But you said you can go in a little late today! No, I'll be back. Is it possible that the call is related to this case? -Hema? -I'll be there in a minute… What happened? -The breaking news you saw on the TV… -Yes. That call was received in the control room yesterday. But we thought it was a prank call… But it's something very serious! Your helmet! -Oh, sorry! -How could you forget it? -Naamam? -No. -Drive safe! -Yeah, yeah. [news announcer] The police are being blamed for ignoring the information from the mystery man! -This has caused panic among the public… -Madam, I kept quiet after heeding your advice. My neck is on the line now! Don't worry sir! You look like you've been through this before! Good morning, Vikram! I hope you saw the news on the TV. You need to investigate the death of that Adyar lady. You and Vishwa report to the control room. Bro, this is the first time we're working on a case together… Let's rock it! -Who's the supervisor control room? -Srinivasan, sir. He's on his way, sir. -Mr. Srinivasan? -Yes, sir. -I'm Vikram, this is Vishwa… -Hi. What can I do for you? Yesterday's unknown call and the death that followed soon after… -We're here to inquire into that. -Go ahead, sir! When did you receive the call yesterday? Around 10:45, sir… No, sir! It was exactly at 10:46! Mukundan sir answered the call! -Trapped now! -Has the call been recorded? All calls to this place are recorded, sir. Mukundan, play yesterday's call recording! Right away… Volume… Don't waste time by asking the usual questions! This place looks like Adyar! There are trees surrounding the house. It appears to be a brick house… The lady in that house is all alone… She's in danger! And she's going to die in some time! Save her, please! Did you track the caller? Sir, we didn't give it any importance assuming it was a prank call… But we never expected it to be this serious, sir! What's the number, sir? 9444303814, sir. Call the network and find out who owns the connection… Get the details of the last tower it was communicating with… -Okay, sir. -Sir… Those aren't under the purview of our department. Why? Can't you do it? You work for the police department too! Proceed with it! Okay, sir. You were careless when you received the call, and now you're quoting the rules! Hello! Police control room… -Vikram, what's our next move? -How can we help you Madam! You managed to let that lady in Adyar die, despite the information I gave! Sir! It's him! S…Sir, tell me! I'll tell you about the incident that's going to happen next! Don't take this lightly like you did yesterday! No, sir, we won't. But before that, could you give us your address and phone number? Madam, I'm informing this because I see it as my duty… You needn't track me! I thought of something… And I want to tell you about it. The place looks like Mount road. A car and a truck are going to have a head-on collision and cause an accident! The person in the car is going to die, madam! Please try to stop the accident from happening, madam! Sir, I don't understand exactly what you're trying to say… You said you saw some visions, could you explain those in detail-- Madam, instead of talking to me, inform the concerned department and prevent the accident! Please! [news announcer] The mystery man who predicted the death of the Adyar woman-- Sir! He's informed the media too! What do we do now? If he's talking about Mount road… -Srinivasan… -Sir? Alert all signals from Guindy to Central! Team alert! You heard the man… Alert all stations from Guindy to Central. Okay, sir! Teynampet police station? D1 station? We're calling from the control room… No matter how much we alert them, nobody at the station would take this seriously! Because I myself don't believe any of this! Isn't there a chance that the caller could be the culprit? Do this… Ask Vignesh to monitor this from the control room. -Okay! -We'll try to alert as many signals as we can! Hey, tell me! Vignesh, all okay? -There are 23 signals on Mount road… -Okay! But we are only able to connect to eight cameras through our IP address. I've connected those feeds to the control room and I'm keeping a watch on them. Uncle? Isn't Cheenu back? He's always roaming around tensed! Why is he tensed? He only attends phone calls! You said it. Do you want tea or coffee? -Tea-- -Following the information from the mystery man… The security arrangements have been beefed up at Chennai Anna Salai. The traffic police are involved in clearing traffic very cautiously. So far, there have been no accidents as mentioned by the mystery man! Just like they make a mountain out of a mole hill… The media is blowing some small thing out of proportion! There are accidents and deaths that happens every day across Tamilnadu! You wait and watch… He's going to call in a random accident as his prediction! [phone rings] The first and the second call were both placed from the same number… His name is Maheshwaran. I've asked for his address to be verified… The first call was from Lungma, in Sikkim state. The second call originated from Kerala, in Thrissur. -From Thrissur? -Yes, from Thrissur! The connecting flight from Sikkim to Cochin takes 24 hours! How is it possible, Vignesh? I think he might have erased the IMEI and placed a net call. Attention everyone! Alert all our constables on Mount road once again! Ask them to alert us even if a minor incident occurs! Come on! Get to work! For a change, Mount Road is empty and free of traffic jams today! If all the places are to be clear of traffic jams, someone has to make up rumors like these! What else could they do? If an accident occurs, the public would lose confidence in the police! That's the reason the police are on alert. My wife would scold me if I forgot my lunch! -Vignesh… -Yes. It's 10:45, I'm off now. I'm leaving too… -Vivek. -Sir? You'll have to take care of things till I'm back in the morning. -Call me if there is any problem. -Okay, sir! Sir! Come here for a minute. Why is he jinxing me by calling-- Look… Both signals are green! Hey… Devar statue! Nandanam signal! Inform the station! E3 station, come in! E3 station! [truck honks] Hey! Hey! Oh no! Oh my God! -What we hoped wouldn't happen, has happened! -Damn! When did it happen? [sirens blaring] Vignesh, ask the ambulance to rush to the hospital! Okay, sir! Oh, sir is here! Hello, sir. Sir, he was the first person to reach the spot. -What happened? -Sir… Usually, all signals on Mount Road are active till 12 o'clock, sir. This signal in particular, wasn't working, sir. We've been operating it manually for a week now. The contractors arrived today to inspect it! While they were testing it, both signals turned green and caused the accident! Who was attending to the fault? He did, sir. Hey! Where are you from? -I'm from around here, sir. -How many of you are here? How long have you been planning this? Sir, we didn't plan anything! How did both the signals turn green at the same time without your planning? Sir, I swear I don't know anything! Sir! Take him in! He won't answer if we question him this way! Sir! I don't know anything… You're supposed to enter the city only after ten… How come you're on Mount road at ten? Sir, I was unloading a government contract goods. I think he's drunk, sir! No, sir! I just ate a biriyani on the way! It stinks! -Did they make the biriyani out of crow meat? -Vignesh… You better tell us what happened! Sir, the car crossed my path while I was driving! I'm innocent! The signal was green when I crossed it. Sir, hold him here, we'll question him later! -Come on! -Sir! Sir! We shouldn't let him walk scot-free! -Sir! -The joint commissioner is here! Sir. Sir. What is all this, Vikram? How could you be so careless? It's a drunken drive case, sir. The truck was over speeding. [news announcer] Just as the mystery man predicted… There has been an accident at the Nandanam signal, an important junction at Anna Salai. The accident has sent shockwaves across the community. The injured person died on the way to the hospital. [radio jockey] Good morning, everyone! This is Hello FM, 106.4… From Mount road to Kathipara junction, the roads are jam-packed! But don't lose your cool! If you're a regular on that route, I'm sure you know what shortcuts to take! Share those shortcuts with others, so they can benefit from it too! Speaking of help reminds me of another issue… -[horn blares] -We must share our knowledge… To prevent others from falling into mishaps… There are many people in our city who wish to do that! And there is someone who's already doing that! Yes, the death of the Adyar lady… The accident on Mount road… He's calling out every single event! Do things happen because he says they will? Or is he able to predict the future? Or does he execute the events he predicts? A lot of TV channels are debating this! Two lives have been lost because of their carelessness! How do they plan to answer this? This is the incompetence of the police department… Would they accept such a statement? And here is an update from our Leader! Greetings, commissioner sir! What's going on in the city? The media is pretty enthusiastic about someone predicting all the current events! We can face questions only if your department is enthusiastic about solving this! This is the people's government! Anything that scares the people or diverts their attention, shouldn't be allowed to grow! Find him and question him at once! Sir! Sir! -Sir! -Who is the mystery man? -Sir! Sir! -Yeah. There have been two consecutive incidents in Chennai, what do you-- -I can't talk about that… -[commotion ensues] -Sir,sir! -Please answer our questions! [commotion ensues] Sir! Please sir! Good morning, everyone! -Good morning, sir! -Please sit down. Who was handling this case till now? -Inspector Vikram and Inspector Vishwa, sir. -Sir! We had already deputed these two for the Adyar lady death case, sir. Since we got the second call while they enquiring about that case, I asked them to proceed with this as well. Alright! Okay! Guys, can you give us an update? Sir, both calls were from the same number but originated from different towers. And he's used IMEI technology to hack the towers, sir. The cell phone number is registered under the name Maheswaran. From Nellore, Andra. That Maheswaran died four months back, sir. What happened to the post-mortem report of the man who died in that accident? We haven't received it yet. He died on the way to the hospital from the accident spot. All the procedures have been completed. We'll get all the reports by 10:30. CM has asked me to investigate this case directly. We need to stop the incident and trace that anonymous caller at the same time. Why should he hide his identity if he's genuine? -Am I right? -Yes, sir! He's our primary suspect. Clear? Alright. So… -We need to close this case on top priority. -Sure, sir! Form a team immediately. Allot a cabin inside the control room since that's his access point. -Yes, sir! Okay, sir! -Alright? Then… who do you think can lead this case? Any names? I would suggest DC Mr.Adithya, sir. He's an efficient officer. Adithya… Guindy right? -Hey, it's DC Adithya. -So what? Don't you know how Padappai Mani died? He showed his true face just four days after his release. You know what happened after that. I'll take the blame. You all don't have to accept. -Did any of those arrested men give a statement? -No, sir. They are all zipped. Sir, they are the ones. What? Are you going to host a feast? Hey… sit properly. Sir, I'm the A1 in that incident on the subway. -I was the one who hit. -How are they flipping so easily? -Sir, all three of us went that day. -What's that subway incident? Elaborate. -Are you asking about the kidnap? -Hey, it's not that. Rape attempt. Right, sir? I did it. You don't know what the case is or what happened. But you are the culprits! Sir… There's one who hasn't opened his mouth. If he starts talking all by himself, I'll take you all to court right away. If not, you'll see my other side. Sir, we can admit to the crime only if you tell us what the case is. -Muthu… -Sir? Okay, sir! Sir… Sir… I was the one who did it. Sir… Sir, I just pushed her while snatching her chain. I went to Thiruvallur in fear right after that. You'll tell this only when we ask you the right way, right? When you were so stubborn as to not talk… You should have safeguarded that chain and not sold it. -Buy him what he wants and get the statement. -Okay, sir. Produce him at the court tomorrow without any damage. -Okay, sir. -Don't let anyone go before that. Yes, sir! [phone rings] -Hey, get up! -Get up! Get up! Come! Come with me! -Sir? -Adithya, we have an important case. -Come to the commissioner's office immediately. -Sure, sir! Sir… Sir! -Sir! -Hello, Adithya. Sit down! -Thank you, sir. Yes, sir! -I think you know what I've called you for. You finish every case perfectly. I'm confident you'll finish this case successfully. -Sure! -Right. So, tell me something about this guy. I'm sure this halfwit just got lucky. Let's not be overconfident and underestimate him. He's caught the CM's attention. -Sir, I'll find a solution in a week. -Good. Form a team you're comfortable with. I know these guys very well and I'll manage with them. Hmm… Alright! Vikram and Vishwa… Join Adithya and give us your best. -Sure, sir. -Thank you, sir. I'll do my level best! Sir, he's called from the same mobile number but the calls have originated from different towers. He believed we wouldn't track his calls until the second call came in just like we'd believed the first call was a fake. Sir, all the details about this case are on this file. Why are you talking about the case, Vishwa? We'll take care of it in the evening. The special team headed by Joint Commissioner Adithya is being very vigilant. -Boss, did you see that? -What? They have appointed DCP Adithya to catch that mystery man. That man has a lot of head weight. He's been transferred eight times. Then they'll have to transfer him for the ninth time, unable to catch that mystery man. Adithya will catch the mystery man and produce him in front of the media. As if he will! That man is audacious to call the police and the media at the same time and gets away easily. -There are a lot of incidents. -Why are you supporting him? -What is your relationship with him? -Illicit relationship… How many of you are there in that gang? What have you planned? Don't stir words. Do you think you can hook me to this case and take over this shop? Do you think I'll take over your shop when it's already in debt? -Mind your work, oldie! -I know. Don't put the cream inside the nose, fool! -Aravind, please wait outside! -Sir? Okay, sir! Basically, there's nothing more to do in this case. You've done everything right. Could these two cases possibly be linked? We didn't find one. It can be confirmed once we get the reports. -What next? -We'll know only when we get another call. It will come! -Bring his call detail reports tomorrow morning. -Yes, sir! Vignesh, shall we leave? -What's your name? -Kumar, sir! -How long have you been working here? -How many times would you ask the same question? I have told all I know to the local inspector. He's inside. Please ask him. What? Is this how you'll talk to the police? -Ask Chandran about the forensic report. -Okay, sir! Hello sir. I'm Venkatesh, the inspector of this precinct. I was the one who inspected this case on the spot. One moment… Give that to me, please! -Here, sir. -This is the post-mortem report. We have no evidence to prove this as a murder, sir. There are no fingerprints, CCTV footage, or suspicious activity. The house was locked from the inside. She was the one who noticed and informed the police. Come here. PM report. -Hello, sir. -Hello! What's your name? -Dhanam, sir. -What happened? No one responded to the calling bell. But the TV was on. I peeped through the window to see madam lying down, sir. Madam lives here alone. Her son lives abroad. They used to talk over the phone often. She's fixed a girl from their kin to get her son married. But that also didn't work out. Vishwa, you collect the other reports. -Sir, please give all the reports at the earliest. -Sure. -Follow it up. Thank you! -Sure, thank you! See you, bye! Switch on camera 4. Wait! Forward it to 10:43. Sir, these are the medical reports of that lady. -Did her relations reach Chennai? -Yes, sir. Did you interrogate them? We did, sir. Where is that guy who came to service the signal? Vishwa has gone to bring him in. Are you sure this is an accident? Yes, sir. We've also collected footage from a private building. How could you treat him that way? What if he's innocent? No, sir. He wouldn't have spilled, no matter what. And if he did, would you have nabbed him? Or would you prove that it was he who called? Sorry, sir. -Leave him. -Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. What happened to that lady's post-mortem report? Sir, the report states she died of a heart attack. Sir… Sir… Tell me… Hello? -Is that him? -Yes, yes! [whispers] Srinivasan sir? What about the post-mortem report of the dead guy in the accident? It was reported that his blood contained traces of alcohol. Sir? What now? Don't waste your time wondering who or what I am. Two events took place already. And you all took it as a joke. Don't take this lightly. This looks like a bank. I guess it's in Anna Nagar. Crores and crores of money will disappear, sir! The public is in a frenzy due to this! And the manager is unable to manage an angry crowd! Please save the people's money somehow! Please! -Vignesh? -Sir! Get me a list of all the banks in Anna Nagar including ATMs. Okay, sir. -Send police protection to all banks and ATMs. -Yes, sir. -Alert bank employees as well. -Yes, sir. Ask them to thoroughly check customers before entering. Yes, sir. One who lost all their money stood hopeless and defenseless The public is in frenzy due to this! And the manager is unable to manage an angry crowd! Anna Nagar, Thirumangalam, Mogappair. Then, JJ Nagar and Ambattur Estate. There are a total of 42 banks and 85 ATMs in these areas. -Vikram? -Sir? -You go to Anna Nagar. -Yes, sir. -Vishwa? -Sir? -Go to Thirumangalam. -Yes, sir. -Srinivasan? -Sir? You take care of areas, JJ Nagar and Ambattur Estate. I want information on the amount of liquid cash -and check which banks are easily accessible. -Yes, sir. Report to me each and every 15 minutes. Update about the mystery man. Cautioned about the forthcoming embezzlement of money in Chennai banks. Police are now stationed at every bank post this caution. The squad led by Adithya, is now under vigilant watch. Okay, I'll ask the Aminjikarai and Koyambedu precincts to send in force. Every data has been updated, sir. -Tell me, dear! -My dear… They vaguely said there's going to be a robbery at the bank in Anna Nagar! I'm scared that they'd target the bank at Anna Salai! This area has 113 banks and ATMs. -How can you find that branch? -Sir, majority turnover of liquid cash happened at 13 branches. And 26 ATMs have recently filled with cash. Our whole focus must be over there. We mustn't falter a bit. I won't let it happen. He's got the whole department running on a wild goose chase! He will definitely get caught. -Sir… -Is everything alright? His call to the media got connected via JJ Nagar North tower. Ask them to scour the whole area. The security plan is working. So far, everything is smooth, sir. Every customer was thoroughly checked and allowed inside. I'm speaking from the Thirumangalam area, sir. There has been no problem till lunch hour. I've reported every detail to the AC's office. And there has been no problem during online transactions. We're on the right track, sir. -Good. -Hello? Tell… I'm calling from the regional office of Canara Bank. There has been no issue till the closing time, sir. -Sir! -Sit. There wasn't any problem till the afternoon. The bank informed us. We're headed on the right track. Heavy security has been stationed at the banks of Anna Nagar and Mogappair areas. So far, nothing has happened. I think we have the situation under control. We've beaten him, sir. Ma'am, my son has sent me money from abroad. I had gone to the ATM to withdraw it. But it says I don't have enough balance. Could you let me know what the problem is? -Please wait, sir. -I need this money, ma'am! Your account didn't receive any money. When was the money credited? Two days ago, ma'am. Alright, do you remember how much it was? Umm… He told me it was 25,000 rupees. -I need to get to work, ma'am. -Please wait a while, sir. -The server is down. -It's urgent, sir. -I need to pay for this by 12 o'clock. -Please wait. Sir… It says his balance is nil. Can you check again? I'm facing the same issue here. -Hold on, I'll check-- -Sir! I need to pay the hospital bill. My husband met with an accident and is admitted, sir. I understand, ma'am. I got here early so that the work would get done faster. I wasn't able to transfer cash. His account has zero balance, sir. I'm facing the same issue here. I'll talk to the Branch Manager. -What happened, ma'am? -Please wait. Sir has gone to clarify. -Tell me clearly. -Ma'am… I understand your situation. [indistinct chatter] The customer who is here has their account emptied, sir. -What are you saying? -Yes, sir. Tell me the customer's account number. 1-4-1-3-8… -That's what they're looking into. Please be patient. -Ma'am, can you pass this check? Please wait for 5 minutes, sir. The manager is in talks about it. They'll arrive anytime. -The manager is figuring it out. -Ma'am it's late--- Excuse me, sir? Can you… please? -Sir? -Yes? You are our valuable customer of this branch. Which is why I'm only telling you this. Due to some server issue, all the account balances are displayed as nil. What do you mean, sir? What?! Money's disappeared?! [all panicking] Nothing, sir. Please give me 30 minutes of time. Sir, please stay calm. Please. A little. Raja! All the money in the bank has been looted! I'm talking outside of MCB Bank by Thirumangalam signal, sir. The public is panicked over their money disappearing. What were you all upto then? There wasn't any physical attempt made. It could be a phishing attack, sir. Oh… Crap! Sir… The Press isn't allowed here. …tell us, sir! Sir, please stay calm! Please give us some time, sir! We'll resolve this issue. I'm standing here out of necessity! [all chattering] Silence! Listen to us, sir. Are you watching the show from the curtains? You should have had it all under control! [all chattering] Interrogate them, sir. Welcome, sir. When will you return our money, sir? They aren't answering! Can all of you please remain calm? No harm will occur to your cash. It's a Governmental loss if the bank loses the money. Money isn't the issue, sir! But we need it in our dire situations! Please give us some time. How much longer? -Vishwa! -[all chattering] Don't scream. Get going, sir. I'm investigating. So leave. Please move. What happened, sir? This money belongs to a women self-help group, sir. And it is we who transfer the cash to various branches. It's a two hour process. It was then transferred to another account. Which account? And how much? 77 crores. And the transferee details are hidden. Is it a technical error? Yes, it is a technical error. Please come, sir. My IT team is taking care of it. Hey. What's going on? -We're checking, sir. -This is that transaction, sir. Sir? Shall I? -Are you sure? -Yes, sir. All the cash from all accounts are transferred to this one account. And that account is hidden. Is it possible? Yes sir, it is possible. Just give me a second. Tell me! Vignesh… The one on top. Open that now. What's the name? Password? -Good job! -Okay. I got it, sir. The hidden account holder is no more. But the account has been active for days. And many transactions have happened. They've broken into the security system to misuse the bank. Which is why, it was easily hackable. Post the verification of all account holders, register a complaint using the name of the bank. Yes, sir! Don't block the way! -Don't block the way! -Listen, everyone! Nobody panic. Everybody's cash is all safe. It was a small technical error. So please stop spreading misinformation! Move it, sir! Enough, move! Don't crowd here. Leave! -Both of you, head back to the office. -Yes, sir. I need to meet someone important. -Okay, sir. -Yes, sir. -I'll take care of it. Don't worry. -Aravind? Sir? Sorry, sir! [phone rings] Yeah, Adithya. -The money has been recovered. -Well done. The network issue has been resolved by the squad led by Adithya. Kudos to them for recovering the issue! The guy really sounds like a great person! [news plays in the background] Annachi, like you earlier said… Using the information the mystery man provided, Adithya and team recovered the money at the bank! How are his predictions coming true? What if he's an astrologer? Whatever maybe. As long as it happens for good. It would be good if you paid me too. -Doctor? -Tell me, Adithya. Can I come visit you? Yes, you're welcome! -Hi, Doctor. -Welcome, Adithya. -Please be seated. -Thank you. How are you? All good, sir. How's everything going? I'm sure you're aware, sir. There's someone meddling with us! Isn't that common in your profession, sir? Yes, Doctor. But I'm… unable to ignore it. He told me earlier about the bank incident. I could literally feel every word he said. It happened at the same location where he predicted. How was that possible, Doctor? The world is filled with strangeness. Don't pay heed. Move past it. And if you start to dig in further, this eon wouldn't suffice. Doctor, I… can't seem to figure out his nature. I see. It's ironic that we're unable to figure out the character of our dear ones. That is… As we connect with another person, we gradually tend to place our trust in them. True, Doctor. Regarding this issue, we need your help. Definitely. I want to listen to whatever he has told you. I must listen to his voice! I'll make a visit to your office, one day. It will be of great help, sir! Breaking News: Using the mystery man's intel-- Doctor, can you raise the volume? Sure. The mystery man has striked yet again with another intel! Let us listen to his voice note. You managed to recover the cash of the public. Thanks! I have another piece of intel. In a multi-storeyed apartment, many people reside there in Chennai. Someone will die of a gas explosion. Please rescue them somehow, sir! Please! People are hoping that no such incidence occurs. Let's hear from the public about the mystery man. Let us hear his opinion about the mystery man… Yes, sir. Some possess the ability to predict the future, such are referred to as prophets. I feel that he might be a prophet. Can you tell us your view of him being termed as a criminal? Did they find proof of his embezzlement? Or of the murders he committed? He saved the public from losing their money! All the corruption happening in the bank, were revealed through him! Many are now calling the mystery man a prophet! What do you say about it? As a God-sent instigator and a person who proclaims the will of God, is referred as a prophet in the Bible. It's alright for one or two events… but every word of his has come true! Doesn't that make him a prophet? I agree with him. To stop a bad event from occuring, not one but a 100 prophets are needed. Are we all going to convict the mystery man or celebrate him as a prophet is something we need to find out! This is Selvaraj from Sun News. I believe him! What are you saying, Doctor? I could sense the fear in his voice. I can sense the suffering! And I don't think he's faking it. There was a lady named Baba Vanga in Bulgaria. After she had met with an accident, the events she predicted, started happening. The same way… Just a minute. In France, a man named Nostradamus in the 15th century, all the events that he predicted, are happening right now! In America, he predicted that President Kennedy will be assassinated by two men and one of them won't be identified. It was a fact! They haven't found the killer behind the bush, yet! And then the Twin Towers? He predicted that two birds will attack them. And lo, 9/11 happened! Not just that, Nostradamus predicted that two people would come to research his grave. And that, one of them would die mysteriously. Bingo, that happened! Out of all his predictions, one that stood out the most was; A leader from India will pave the way for the world! I'm not sure if that happened. It could… It would… If my opinion is right, like them, this person could be a prophet! [phone rings] Even though Theerkadharishi's message is a warning, it has created a fearful situation among the people. Finding the apartment that Theerkadharishi mentioned, posed as the biggest challenge to the police. Many apartments are seen in neighborhoods like OMR, ECR, Oragadam, Ambattur, Anna Nagar. The residents of those apartments are requested to be cautious while handling the cooking gas. [mobile rings] -Hello, Mom? -Yes Deepa! Hang on a second. -Stay on call. -Okay. Deepa! Tell me. -Are you at home? -No, I was out shopping. Just now got in the car. How are my son-in-law and Abi? They're fine, Mom. What's with the tense situation in Chennai? Didn't you see the news? -What is it? -You don't know? Theerkadharishi has said, somebody is going to die due to a gas explosion in their apartment. I stopped watching the news so that I won't listen to these types of sick news. -Who's the maintenance man here? -It's him, sir. -Are you the maintenance person here? -Greetings, sir. -How many houses are here? -In total, there are 1760 houses. Contact everyone from every block and ask them to check their gas line. -Okay. What's the matter, sir? Okay, sir. -Do what I say. -Two of you can go with him to check. -Okay, sir. There are totally 1760 houses. It is difficult to find the one, sir. -Alert the residents in every house individually. -Yes sir. -When will you get home? -I'm about to enter the house. There will be no reception in the basement. I'll get home and video call you. -It's been so long since I saw Abi. -Okay, Mom. Who's there? Anybody here? [gasps] -What? Did you get scared? -Yes. Looks like you did a whole lot of shopping! Groceries and vegetables! Did you talk to Deepa? How's she doing? I was talking to her while I was in the car. -She's fine. -She's in Texas, isn't she? -Yes. -Why don't you go there for a while and have fun? -I should. -Also… I got a call from maintenance. They asked me to check regarding the gas smell. -Did you get the call? -Nope! Poor maintenance. Do check for the smell before turning on the lights. -Okay. Bye! -Oh, thanks. -Off to work? -No. We're planning to sell our car. That's why. I'm getting my car ready to leave. Okay. [explodes] [ambulance siren going off] -What happened? -Don't know. What's the problem? -Where is the noise coming from? -What is this and what's the noise? -Something exploded in the car parking. -Dear God! In the car parking? Just like how Theerkadharishi said, another horrible incident took place in Chennai. The fire accident happened due to the leakage of a gas cylinder in the car. -At what time did it happen? -At 11.30, sir. We came to the spot right away. How did this happen? It's an old model car. They've done gas endorsement. They didn't use the car for a very long time. The car's gas got leaked. It exploded because they started the car unaware of the leakage. -Who is he? -He's the lady's husband, sir. Sir? Sir… she told me earlier. That a guy is predicting the future and told me to be careful. She checked if there are any gas leakages at home. But she forgot to check the car, sir! We advertised our car on OLX to sell it. We didn't expect this would happen. She's gone, sir. -Did you check the CCTV? -We took all the footage, sir. -Who's in the maintenance? -He's the manager, sir. -I need the visitor's record. -I'll tell them to bring it, sir. They would've tampered the cylinder. Could be, sir. There are chances. Didn't you say that they'd bring him in two or three days? When the mystery man repeatedly told us about the murder, were we able to prevent it from happening? Look! Your ironed uniform and gallant stance aren't enough. You should think patiently if you wish to nab him. Why do you call him a mystery caller, boss? Didn't they rename him a Prophet? Look at this. To stop this prophet's prophesy has become a tough nut to crack for the police. How will they patiently crack the case? I'm pretty sure that they'll nab the prophet! Didn't you know that the Tamil Nadu police is the world's second-best after Scotland Yard? -[chuckles] -Really? Oh, you crackhead. Do you really believe in that? I've been hearing this tale since I was small. When asked what magnificent thing Scotland Yard achieved, no one opened up. People have heavily criticized the failed efforts of the police. What are the police up to? Let's talk about this in detail on "Kelvigal Aayiram", tonight! Don't miss this! What is going on, Adithya?! What has your team been doing? Go see the Commissioner immediately! Sir… May I come in? That's a good shot. Dayalan, -please step outside. -Okay, sir. Sir… Welcome, Adithya sir! Given the buildup that I heard about you, I thought you'd actually solve this shit. What a disappointment. You didn't spot a damn thing! You couldn't catch him. And stop the predictions from happening. -Sir, at the bank-- -So what if you recovered the money? Did you take that as a win? All the credit has gone to the prophet. Don't you forget about that. From the media to the opposition party, every question of theirs has ripped you apart! And I have no answers for them! The recovery team's efforts to save a 3-year-old girl child fallen in an unclosed borewell shaft at Achukaadu village, near Tindivanam. The rescue team is on their way to the location. He's even made the breaking news a living hell for us! Did you see the mess? I already told you to form a team. But you didn't. You've now lost everything because of your overconfidence. From now on, you listen to me. Form a team now. Okay? And you're closing this case in two days. I don't want any bloody excuses! I want answers. Is that clear?! -Sir. -OUT. Vikram, if they have ordered for a team with new members, it implies that we did a shoddy job. Isn't that what the Commissioner implied? Alright. Forget about it, dude. We are despised at the department. And by the public. That's our fate. Don't worry and get going… Stop. Stop! Get down. I'll be back. -Hello, sir. -Where are you off to? If you keep blocking us, how will we continue our business? There's ganja smuggled inside vegetables, and chewing tobacco amongst grocery items. You think we're idiots to stop, salute you for nothing? -That's how all policemen think! -Sir! What did you say? "That's how police-- Why are you beating me, sir? I'm not the only one saying this. But the whole town says so. Neither are you at fault nor the whole town at fault. The pain that we undergo… Sir! We feel you. You continue then… -What is your name? -Folk Marley, sir.

What's the matter? You're fiddling on the computer. Why aren't you sleeping? Not really, Dad. All the events that happened prove that they were accidents. But my gut says that these aren't accidents! Can't get any sleep, Dad! If we had an experienced investigator onboard, he'd make a mountain out of a hill! If he had done so, it would have been traceable. He seems to keep making pitstops that never end! Try making a pattern out of those pitstops, dear. It would look lovely as a rangoli for our house! I asked him to make a pattern and you suggested turning it into a rangoli! Good one! Okay, good night! Do whatever you want. Let me connect all the dots. This looks like Adyar. There are trees surrounding the house. Looks like a cement building. There's a lady alone. And in danger! She's going to die soon! Save her, please! That place looks like Mount Road. A car and a lorry will soon collide causing an accident. The person in the car will soon die, ma'am! Please stop this accident from happening, please! This looks like a bank. I guess it's in Anna Nagar. Crores and crores of money will disappear, sir! And the manager is unable to manage an angry crowd! Please save the people's money somehow! Thank you for calling the police control room. Hello, this is the police control room. -How may I-- -It's me, ma'am. -Excuse me? -Everyone knows my voice except you, huh? -Sir! It's him! -Uhh… Hello? Ma'am? Is anyone on the line? -Okay? -Hello? Doctor, is it possible to find his intention behind this? Please don't waste my time. This is something important. Can someone come on the line? -Hello? -Hey? Hey. Don't panic. I am Iniyan. I'm a psychiatrist. I'm here to understand you better and help you! I'm not here to listen to you and have you imprisoned. I can empathize how you feel right now. Are you Dr. Iniyan… from Anna Nagar? -Am I correct? -[chuckles] Pleasure. I appreciate your effort to know me. But… [chuckles] I don't reside at Anna Nagar. If you had Googled me properly, it would appear on the 6th page. Alright, doctor. What would you like to ask me? First, relax yourself. Just relax. Okay now, in your subconscious mind… How long have you known about the predictions? I met with an accident last year. I can't recollect how it happened! The day I regained my consciousness, I had a premonition that some boy will meet with an accident! At first, I thought it was just a dream. The next day in the newspapers, the face I saw in that dream was the same in the rail accident! From then on, I lost my inner peace. The pain and agony it brought weakened me, doctor! -Sometimes, I've had suicidal thoughts! -Oh no, cool down. Cool down. Don't stress yourself! I understand you mean well. I can help you come out of this! Of course not, doctor. I've consulted many doctors regarding my condition. All prescribed the same medicine, sleeping tablets. Haha, well… Isn't that also a medical procedure? Isn't sleep a cure for many illnesses? Listen, I can help you reclaim your peaceful life. But, you need to cooperate with me and provide some intel. Like, details of the hospital you were admitted, your parents, your childhood, the surrounding you were brought up… If you could also tell me about your native-- Doctor… Don't you take me for a fool! You and I are under the eyes of the police control. The reason behind my concealed identity, for the police to not frame me for all events that occurred. Everyone is a potential criminal if they possess the intel on the upcoming event! And I don't want to fall into that hole. He changed his location quickly… How is his signal jumping from one country to another? -It keeps changing! -The nerve! Now let me tell you the reason why I called. The treasure of our country! Retrieved from the age-old land, is a priceless statue of a god which will be smuggled abroad. The location where it is at looks like a place filled with containers. I see buildings and roads surrounding that area. Save the symbol of Tamil Nadu's pride! Please! I am not going to disclose this intel to the media. That mustn't create an escape of convicts. He is not a psycho. Neither is he a patient. I repeat, he is a prophet. "This man, this work shall thus work out, let thoughtful king command; Then leave the matter wholly in his servant's hand." Which is why he chose to tell you. First, find the statue! He is a prophet! [inaudible] Hey! [in Telugu] I'm telling you. I need the money by morning. This Konda Reddy doesn't take those who don't keep their word lightly! Understood? Now, hang up! Hello, Reddy Garu. -Konda Reddy? -Yes, sir! -Is it that yard then? Confirm? -Confirmed, sir! -We'll be there soon! -Okay. Who's Konda Reddy, sir? He's a big-time statue smuggler! Customs, police, excise… He's a businessman who's got influence everywhere! [in Telugu] What is it, Parthiba? How are you? How could I ever suffer when I'm under the patronage of elders like you! Hey, Mysore Zacharia spoke highly about you! You are the leading seller. But I don't need anyone's recommendation. I'm Konda Reddy! Konda Reddy! You are the king in this business! -[laughs] -I'm local! -You're international! -[laughs] Where is my God? -Come, show me! -Please follow me. [laughs] -Where is it? -Over here, sir. [in Telugu] Tell me! What should I do for you? I need 300 crores very urgently, sir! -Is it for the by-election? -Yes, sir. -Okay, I'll send it to you! -Thanks, sir! -I'm very happy! -Okay. Take this phone! Nobody here understands your power, Lord! That is why I'm sending you to France. It's my blessing! Reddy Garu, this statue is 1000 years old, from Thanjavur! Hey, Parthiba! I have a power… I can tell just by looking at the statue… This is an iridium statue! Its insides are made of emerald! That's why I've traveled all the way! I'll fix the price for my God! 500 crores! 100 crores in advance! -Hey, Raju! -Tell me, sir. Send it to him! Parthiba, deliver this statue to the address I tell you! If you try to fool me because you're getting a huge sum… They'll hang a garland in front of your photo at your house, be careful! Reddy garu, you've paid me an unexpected amount as advance! I know all too well about you! This statue will reach the location you specify! [in Telugu] This Konda Reddy doesn't take those who don't keep their word lightly! Do it with caution. Sir! Give that to me. Sir, they went into this container. Those three walked inside! Update us on their activities. I'll follow them. Let's go. Vishwa… -Take lead! -Okay! Okay, sir. [gunshots] [gunshots] Vishwa… There's a guy behind you, on the left! [gunshots] [gunshots] Are you alright? -No, sir! -Let's move. SIr, if you keep going, there should be a crane on your left! Don't let it go! Go! Go! [engine revs] Go! Keep moving! Move! Let's go! Don't let them go! [news announcer] Statues worth 700 crores were recovered! Thanks to the leads from the Prophet… A Statue of Natarajar worth 800 crores, which was to be smuggled to France… has been recovered, along with three other statues. Parthiban and his associates were shot dead. Sir, only the accused have died in the shootout that occurred! Really? -No comments, next! -[phone rings] Isn't it against human rights? This is a sensitive case. Please give us some time. We'll get back to you with all the information, is that clear? -No more questions! -Tell me, Hema. You might have saved God, but the prophet got the credit for it! [chuckles] I'm so proud of you! Ah, thank you! Thank you! Congratulations to your entire team. -Thank you! -Hang up. [phone rings] Who was it, sir? Your wife? How do you know that? I knew it when she kept talking without letting you respond. [chuckles] -Are you married? -No, sir… You'll learn about it after marriage! If he accepted everything and appeared in front of the police, Wouldn't the police book him in all the cases and send him to jail? If the prophet contested the elections, I'd vote for him! [news announcer] In Acchukadu village, near Dindivanam… serious efforts are ongoing to rescue the girl who fell into a borewell shaft. In order to rescue the child, who's stuck at a depth of seventy feet… a huge pit is being dug parallel to the borewell shaft. As the girl has been battling for survival for the past 30 hours… The gut-wrenching images of her crying mother, has been haunting everyone's minds! We'll definitely save her! Reassure her, sir! Save her somehow! [thunder] I'm doing everything I can! We'll do our best to save her. The operation underway at Acchukadu village, to rescue the girl stuck in the borewell shaft… Has hit a major snag! Rain clouds have started to surround the village! -The child, who has been stuck for 2 days-- -God, help that child! …has been mentioned in the weather report. -Why did you stop working? -They asked us to stop working! Go, ask them! They told you to stop?! Okay, sir! Why did you ask them to stop, sir? This is an order from the collector! Ask them to stop working. Get going! Sir, if we had another half an hour, we can save the child! Now, look here… We don't get to decide anything over here. 15 minutes. Clear up everything by then. -Please get going! -Okay, sir. Sir… Everyone is under the impression that the child will be rescued… Do something, sir. Please! Careful! The water might seep inside! -Velu… -Huh? They've asked us to stop working. What are you saying? We've only got six feet to go! I tried to convince them… But they asked us to stop! [sobbing] Murthy… Sir, what are you doing? Why are they stopping the work? What can we do, sir? We can only do as we are told. My granddaughter is still alive! Don't stop working now! What happened to you? Oh no! I've lost my child! I've lost my child! Our rescue team is only asking for 30 minutes… What can we do? The soil test indicates that there would be a mudslide! We decided this to prevent the loss of eight lives to save one. Let's take a chance, madam! There is a lot of pressure from the minister's side, sir! Sorry, madam! What is it, sir? Tell me, collector. Has the situation come back to normal over there? We didn't know it would end this way. Sir, we've tried all this while… If we had another half an hour, the child-- What are you getting at? The rescue team is enthusiastic. Let their efforts not be in vain, sir! If there is any danger to the rescue team… Would you take responsibility, Collector? Sorry, sir! Because of the constant rain, there have been difficulties in rescuing the child… The rescue operation has been stopped as of this moment. Due to the heavy ongoing rains… and because the child who has been stuck for the past 34 hours, has stopped displaying signs of life… the rescue efforts are being wrapped up, on recommendations from the medical team. The people of Tamil Nadu had hopes that the girl, Raghavi, would be rescued! The current news has pushed everyone into a state of sadness. Hello! The police are your friends… -How may I assist you? -It's me, madam. -Sir… -I've got important information for you! The girl who fell in the borewell is still alive. Continuing the rescue effort for half an hour will save her life! Please don't abandon the rescue efforts. [news announcer] Just as reports of the rescue efforts being abandoned are flowing in… The prophet's request, "30 minutes of digging can rescue the child"… has brought some relief to everyone! "Will the prophet's request be heeded?" "Or will it be rejected?" This is the question on everyone's mind! Is that so? The prophet himself has said this? Our government will pay heed to anyone who raises their voice for the good! We will give it a try once again! [news announcer] Raghavi, the girl who fell into a borewell shaft in a village near Tindivanam… has been rescued alive. The prophet had predicted that the girl was still alive. As per the orders of the Chief Minister, the rescue team has put their lives on the line… and saved the child! Our thanks go out to them! And to the prophet who brought this to the attention of the Chief Minister… deserves my heartfelt thanks! This government pays heed to the concerns of the public! This government has proved itself… that this is the people's government! Thank you. The God that I pray to hasn't abandoned me! Raghavi, my dear! -Raghavi! -My sweetheart! -Thank you so much, sir! -Glad to be of help. I'd like to thank everyone who fought to save my child! Thanks to him calling the chief minister… and his actions… my girl has been brought back alive! I'd like to thank him for that. I don't know who the prophet is… Nor do I know his name… But he's my guardian angel! [news announcer] The girl who was battling for her life for the past 36 hours… has been rescued alive after intense efforts. The news has brought joy all over the state! Mr. Sadasivam, the branch manager of MCT bank in Tirumangalam, Chennai… committed suicide by hanging at his home. It appears that he committed suicide fearing all the cases filed against him. It's notable that the same bank… -was responsible for the loss of crores-- -[phone rings] The money was recovered with the help of the police… -Yes… -Sir… This is the prophet! I have important information… Consecutive murders are about to take place near Mylapore and Guindy! Try to save them! Please! -Hello-- -Please save them! Hey! Hello! There's not a soul in sight! Everyone's gone for tea. [tires squeal] [screams] [phone rings] [multiple phones ring] -Tell me, Srinivasan. -Sir, he called again! He says there are going to be consecutive murders! -Where? -He said Mylapore and Guindy, sir! -When? -He hung up without informing me that! Ask Vikram and Vishwa to reach those neighborhoods soon! -Sir! -Sir! Check all the CCTV feeds from Mylapore and Guindy, immediately! Call Srinivasan. -When did you arrive? -11:30, sir! The murder had occurred by the time we were on rounds, sir. -We've informed everyone, sir. -Sir… I spoke to Srinivasan. He said he'll check all the footage in the control room! Call me after you've sent the body to the government hospital. -Okay, sir! -Let's go to Guindy. We don't know who did this. We don't have any suspicions yet. I'll explain everything in detail, later. No. There are people around. I can't talk freely. Please understand! -Who's on the call? -Relation, sir! Why is it an unknown number? Sir, I saved it under that name on my phone. -Hello? -Hello? What happened? Who's that lady? Sir, it's my second wife. I saved the number that way because it would be a problem if my family found out … -Let's go! -Sorry, sir! I'm stuck with guys like these, in a time like this! We have to sort out this case! -We'll figure it out sir, don't worry! -[phone rings] We'll nab them! Hello? When? What happened? One more incident, sir. [phone rings] -Sir? -Srinivasan, where are you? -Control room, sir!-When did you receive that call? It was at 11:30. I informed E1 station immediately! Sir, what happened? He's done what he said. Sir, his call was-- Don't bother, Srinivasan! It's of no use. No, sir! His phone is still active, sir! The calls he had placed earlier, was from the sim cards of the dead people! This time, his call… was connected to the Royapuram tower! That sim in now active, sir! Even his WhatsApp display picture has a photo… But for his last call… the IMEI number was connected to another sim, sir! Send me his WhatsApp photo and the CDR! Definitely, sir. I'll send it right away! Sir… all the calls to that SIM was connected to a tower in North Madras. -There are three pending cases on Karunakaran. -He could be the one we are searching for. -No one else should know our plan to catch him. -Yes, sir. -You both go and share your live location with me. -Okay, sir! Where is he now? He's in a 50 meter radius. That's what the map is showing. Okay, let's go a little further. He should be somewhere here. -Let's go! -Let's go! -We have the signal here. -The map is accurately showing this place. He should be somewhere here. [inaudible chatter] -Come, I need to go to Pachaiyappa's. -Hey, hey! -What, man? -Police?! Do you think you're such a big accused to commit murder? What? I am an accused but I am not that brave enough to commit murder. Who are the ones behind these five murders? Five murders? I may look the part, but I'm not worth it. I'm a dummy piece, sir. I only pick pockets. Why are you spinning tales? Didn't you call from this number to tip off the control room yesterday? From my phone… Understood sir, understood now. Have you come in search of the one updating the media? That's not me, sir. Last night… I think in Triplicane bar. One guy gave me a swig and made an outgoing call. It should be him. -Where is he? -Wait… He… If you go like this and just go that way… -Sir? Oh God! -What? Sir, I'm saying I'll lead you to him. Why are you hitting me? Sir, you should respect an approver. Will you? -First show him, then we'll give respect. -Right! You're hitting me for no reason. -I'll give the bottle when I'm wearing my slippers. -Come! I'm coming, sir. Come on! If you try to escape… that's it! My hands will get broken after a slip and fall in the bathroom. I know. That's how my uncle came home. All these are normal to us. Karuna… Will you parcel two idlies when you come? Sister, they're going to make me eat porridge. -Get going! -Don't forget, sister. It's an arrest. Go into the town and tell they caught me like big rowdies. Do you think she'll tell? She won't, sir! Hey… look over there! I think Karuna would have given us away. Go for him if they get closer. This trap is not for us. Let's continue! Sir, the ones behind belong to a different category. They'll give a lot of trouble. Did you see how they're backing off after seeing you? Hey, come here! Sir, he'll be somewhere here. Sir, it feels like under the Kathipara bridge. At night time, when there's less traffic. Some five men are following a random fellow on a bike. He's running to save his life. They's trying to kill him right there, sir. Save him, sir! Please! Sir… it's confirmed. We're in the spot. Boss, the police wouldn't believe if you talk in the same voice. They'll get bored. The game will be interesting only if you create confusion. -Talk like our Thalapathy. -[imitates] Sure! Brother, I think a gang is going to murder a man going under the Kathipara bridge. You should only save him, brother! I'm waiting! [applauds and chuckles] You are all dancing to the tunes, now. It is always Superstar Thalaivar for me. Can you talk like him? [imitates] Dear, I think it's the Kathipara bridge. I can hear the planes flying above. A gang of five men have stopped a man and are stabbing him. He can be saved if you come now. [fanatic laughter] -How's this? -It's not worth it. Thalapathy, Thalaivar, Thala… Name whoever… -Can they sustain in front of my Vaadhiyar? -Hey, hey! Why are you torturing him? Hey, Vasu! Imitate "Thangapadakam" Shivaji for our guests! What do you say, boss? Who is that, Karuna? Hey, idiot! Are you asking who they are even after seeing them wearing khaki pants and red shoes? Listen, just answer properly to their questions and run away. -Who are they? -Police… Police? Who is that hitting with so much force? -Come on, let's run away. -Here! Come on. Run, run, run! DTS is very loud. Bowling is very strong and the stump flies with the spin. All wickets down. It's just the two of us now. You're saying it's my turn! -Shall we start? -Sure, bro! [imitates] Dear… I have nothing to do with this gang. They paid me to do mimicry. There's no mistake on my, brother! Don't you brother me. Sir, there's no mistake on my part. Why are you thrashing me like this? What sin did I commit, sir? [gun fires] I was planning to finish the few left-out commitments and pin them on the prophet. But if you come sniffing even before that, how'll I make my living? Why are you explaining all these to them, bro? What if we kill these two and write it off on the prophet? You thought of a point in a split second! He's my strength! -Give it. -Here, brother! [phone rings] [man gasps] Damn, let's go! Run! Joint Commissioner Adithya and his special team arrested the culprits involved in the double homicide that took place in Mylapore and Guindy. I knew it from the start that prophet has nothing to do with this gang. -How? -The prophet has never called himself one anywhere. But that fellow gave himself in calling himself the prophet. A gang had planned to commit four to five murders by imitating one of our regular informers. But, once again Adithya's team tracked him and arrested him. So, we are safe. [phone rings] Hello! The police are your friends. This is the Chennai city police control room. -Hello, sir. It's me again. -Hello? Sir, it's him! Amidst the shocking news, the prophet has joined hands with the media. Let's hear him. A few unpleasant incidents took place in the last few days. Baby Raghavi has been saved as evidence to say that God exists. I'm happy about that. But at the same time, it makes me feel really bad to hear my name has been used to commit those sins. It's scary to think they might take advantage of my name as long as I exist. I'm not going to tell anything from now on. That doesn't mean I'm a saint to control my thoughts. I have come to a final decision! I'm going to commit suicide in sometime. -Five… -No, don't! -Wait, man! -Four… People like you should be alive. -Three… -Hey, hey! Two… One… [gun fires] Damn it! [claps] Well played! Excellent move! Yes… The Prophet! He's nowhere! He spoke at the right time and made people believe. But… But… He is… now… here! There's one person left in his list. I don't know! He could have fired with the gun pointed to the ground to fool us! -What are you blabbering, Mr.Srinivasan? -I'm not, sir. All we heard is a sound! Sir, he duped us by keeping our focus on him and on the incidents that happened. All of those murders are pre-meditated. Do you have any proof? I don't have evidence to prove he committed the murders, but there are reasons to believe he's committed the murders. Sir, a person couldn't have done this alone. Why are you confusing me, Srinivasan? Please explain clearly. I'm not confusing you, sir. But he has. Let me explain. He's received a call from Tindivanam to the same number he called us from. What's the name of the girl who fell into the bore well pit? -Raghavi. -Raghavi… The point to be noted is, the tower from where the call originated is near that bore well. Not just this one point, sir. If you connect the dots from all the incidents… You'll realize how beautifully he has covered it up. We need to start with the train accident he told us about. That accident also took place in Tindivanam. It's natural to think there's no connection between the one who died in that train accident and this case. But… that's the first point. When I explained to Dr. Iniyan about this train accident, there was a small gap. Did any of you notice? Silence prevailed in that gap. The day I regained consciousness, I felt some boy is going to die in a train accident. At first, I thought it was a dream. But… When I saw the same face in the news paper the next day… -that he died in a train accident-- -He's forced us to believe his super power idea. All those who were murdered are close relatives of Parthiban, the one who was shot dead for trafficking statues. The one who died in the train accident is Kalai Arasan. He fell in love with a girl named Devaki and married her. Devaki committed suicide a few days after Kalai Arasan's death. Devaki's father is none other than the one who died in the Nandanam car accident. That girl's maternal uncle is Sadasivam, the Branch Manager of MC bank. This is a photo that was taken at Sadasivam's daughter's wedding. He has uploaded it to his Facebook page. The surprise element here is that everyone who died attended this wedding. Srinivasan sir… Then who is that prophet? It could be the brother of the one who died in the train accident, his friend, a close relative, or anyone! Okay, but what is his motivation? Kalai Arasan could have died because someone attacked him. That murder could have been shaped as an accident. Just like how the murder by the relatives was carved into an accident, he took revenge against those behind it and made everyone believe those were accidents too. But now, I'm going to tell you with certainty despite not being the prophet. If I'm not wrong, I think his hunt is not over yet. The last person he's going to kill will… have a gruesome death! All the police need is evidence. They'll wait till they get it all. Don't leave him, brother! Don't leave him! We'll face everything. How dare he elopes with our girl? Stay calm, Prema. I'll take care! Brother, even I'm on line. Devaki should become Prema's daughter-in-law. Keep that in mind! Do it if you can, else I'll take care! I won't let it go. I'm saying I'll take care. You never live up to your words. We'll take care. Bye! Sumathi… Prema… -These two… -Brother, it's the police. You're illegal and you're a bank manager. Don't stay here. Leave immediately. It looks like the new SP. What do we do now, brother? He's also a distant relative. He grew up without knowing our customs because he studied abroad. -Let him come. We'll talk to him. -Okay, brother. -Hello, sir! -What's happening here? Why is he tied up? -That's nothing… -Murder plan? We have no such plan, brother. I wanted to meet you myself. I'm really proud to see our men placed in such high ranks. That moron insulted my whole family! It's love, right? Now leave. -I'll take the necessary actions, legally. -Hey, I'm talking. -I'm telling you. Keep quiet. -Go man. Leave! -Sir, listen to me. -Mahesh, take him away! Brother, brother… Hey, wait! Brother… brother! Is it wrong that I diligently took care of my daughter for 20 years? Can't you see the pain in the eyes of the girl's father? Give a statement that you have no connection to that girl and walk away. Sir, I believed you would support me. We both love each other deeply! If you are adamant that you want her, you wouldn't live. You would be lying here as a corpse if I hadn't come. You better write it down and walk away. No one has the right to separate us, sir. Both of us are majors. Who denied that? That's why I'm trying to compromise. Otherwise I would have dealt it differently. You are a police officer. Do what you have to do legally, sir. Instead, don't support them and threaten me. I know the law and also how to face it! Brother, chill. What you did is lawfully right, but you cannot order me to do the same! Is he your son? Do you know why your son committed suicide? A girl has lodged a complaint against your son. He fell before a train because he was scared of the police. Sir… He's the father of the guy who died in that train accident. Greetings, sir! -Are you his father? -Yes, sir! -Your name? -Das. -Native? -Coimbatore, sir. Why are you in Tindivanam? We moved here for my son's education. You look like a rogue… How different would your son be? Where do you work? Electrician. Alright… Why did you want to meet me? My son is not a rogue, sir. He didn't commit suicide. How do you know that? What? You're giving an electrifying look! Yeah, right! You are an electrician. Go ahead! Learn the truth about your son's suicide. I know truth is bitter… Your son has all the bad habits in this world. Girls are his weakness. He tried to fool a girl in the name of love. But she lodged a police complaint when she realized the truth. So he killed himself in fear. This is what happened! Get his signature on the statement and see him out. Yes, sir! Come with me, sir. Let's go, sir! Hello, dear! Did you recognize me yet? Do you recollect this rogue face? I'm the reason behind everything! But I won't accept it. So… You're the reason behind everything! Did my son kill himself, sir? How's that? He had all the bad habits in this world. Am I right? He doesn't, sir… But I do! Do you want to guess? If some mistake happens… I'll try talking to them. After them I'll fight them. I can't go around taking revenge at this age. So… I used your technique against you! Tell me how. I framed the murders to look like accidents. That's the technique! Hi, dude! He's my buddy! Didn't you say my eyes had an electrifying look? I could have burnt you right there… What would have happened then? You would have imprisoned me for life. Who would kill those involved in my son's killing? I should only do! While you wanted to pee… [chuckles] Pee… Did you feel the shock like the sharp prick? The thing is… Everyone who's made a mistake should die realizing it. This is for that! My son and that girl… Would have had numerous dreams about their life. Mom… Hey, Kalai. What's all this? What have you done? Dear… Hey, how could you support him? Mom, that is… We lived in this town without inviting any trouble. But now… Let go, Chitra! Sir is here as a groom. Nothing is going to change. He has just started his life. He has started it with a problem… Let him face it. It'll give him strength. Look, they trust us. Let's bless them! Think about that girl's family and our situation. -Without thinking about anything-- -Hey! There's no situation! We are not that poor to starve… Nor is he a fool who doesn't know what to do with his life. Listen, love doesn't happen with planning. Love is all about understanding each other! Okay? What's your name? Devaki, Uncle! Very good! You've married him leaving everything else behind. What do you actually like in him? Kalai is very brilliant, Uncle. He's a very good man! I believe we'll lead a happy life! Wow! See, your son's caring nature has earned you a beautiful daughter-in-law. Just like I care for you! -I had to talk so much! -What's this, dear? Parents' duty is to give their children a happy life. And it's for the children to live a happy life without troubling their parents. We'll surely live up to your expectation, Dad. Humans are born to be achievers! In that path… One is bound to face all kinds of emotions! Amidst all this, love also exists! We decide for our children. We think we are doing good and so day in and day out, we nag them to study, remind them of the upcoming exams, and feel happy turning them into machines by sending them to different coaching centers. When all that gets over… A beautiful thing creeps in to make them realize who they are. That is what is called love! That is love! Let them live… Why should we steal that happiness? Bless them if you are okay. If not… You should have just stepped away. Being born with privilege is nothing to be proud of. When one reaches it after working hard… That makes him proud! If you had let the son of this electrician live… He would have become a collector. You destroy someone for money, exploiting your powers… What did you gain from that? Did you ever think about what'll happen if the same thing happened to you? This damn thing… Punishing the culprits… Is very interesting and thrilling! You'll never experience it! You don't bring the perpetrators before justice. I'm an idiot! Wasting my time lecturing someone who's going to die! People have assumed I'm the prophet not knowing the truth. That's not going to continue, but… If people like you show their arrogance… Another prophet will arise to put an end to him! He'll surely come! Tell them! Sir… Sir… Our DC… Look, sir! Sir… Please help him! Sir… Sir… -Sir? -What happened, Vikram? -What happened? -There's no one here, sir. -Wha… What happened? -Si… Sir? He's no more!
