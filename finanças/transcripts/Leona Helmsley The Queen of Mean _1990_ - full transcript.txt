[ Swing music playing ] Mama, mama, look at me! Look at me! So this is your first dance. Don't let him hold you too tight. Mama! Look at Sandra, Leona. Isn't she beautiful? You should be so beautiful when you get her age. Man: Good morning, Leona. Leona: Good morning. Now when the jury comes in, I want you to remain composed, regardless. Understood? And after the verdict's been read-- they don't know me. They don't know who I am. They don't know what I am. They don't know what I've done. They're gonna come in and they're gonna pass judgment on me. - That's the system. - Well, it stinks. You think I'm worried about what people think of me? I've been judged by the best of 'em; I've been judged by the worst of 'em. As far as I'm concerned, it don't mean squat. There she is! [ Reporters clamoring ] [ All shouting questions ] - Any predictions, Leona? - You think you'd be prosecuted if you were a man? - Absolutely not. - No comment, please. If I were a man, they would've said it was good business. Do you still think only the little people should pay taxes? - I never-- - Leona! Please, will you let US through? Hey, Leona, if you need a job, I got a coffee shop just down the block. Oh yeah? I'd be the best waitress you ever had. You'd be lucky to get me. Leona, how's Harry? When's he coming in? - Female reporter: Leona. - Male reporter: Miss Helmsley. The jury's still out, thank you. Do you still believe you're nothing but a scapegoat for other self-interested individuals? I'll be right out. Leona, is Harry going to be here for the reading of the verdict? - Get out! - Is it-- get the hell out! Woman: Hi, Leona. Excuse me. I'm Joe lubin. Would you care to dance? Sure. You know, I've watched you here before. Oh? You come in with some girlfriends, dance a few dances, and then you leave by yourself. I'm married. So am I. If you're married, why do you come here? These afternoon dances are to pick up somebody. Or just to dance. [ Chuckles ] Let's have dinner together. I can't. Leo. Well, I've been shopping all day. Are we still on for dinner? I called the house already, Leo. The babysitter's there. Jay is fine. All right. Gatsby's, 8:00. Mm-hmm. Hi, Jay, it's mommy. Yes. Did Rebecca give you dinner yet? No no no. I don't wanna talk to her. Just be sure you do what she tells you. Yes, mommy and daddy will be home later. Well, we love you too. And mama called while you were out, and I expect her to ask how Jay is. You would think she didn't have a grandson, because all she can talk about is Sylvia and her Insulin, and how Sylvia had a reaction last night and thank god Sandra was there and what would she do without Sandra. She wants me to drive Sylvia to the doctor. Leo: Why not? You've got a car. Leona: That's not the point, Leo. Leo: What is the point? Forget it. Be right back. Should I write this off to coincidence? I think maybe destiny. My husband plays gin rummy every Saturday night. I'll make a reservation at the Pierre. Dinner at 7:00. Have a good evening. Happy anniversary. Six months tonight. [ Chuckles ] How you feeling? Comfortable. Comfortable? [ Laughs ] Comfortable is the best feeling I've ever had. Why have I never seen you excited? Why? - I get excited. - You get angry. But isn't that excitement? You know what I mean. I've never seen you really happy. I've never seen you let go of yourself. You seem to live off of other people's reactions to you. Leo gives me $75 a week house money. If you gave me the same amount-- if you gave me $75 a week, I wouldn't have to take Leo's money. I wouldn't have to sleep with him anymore. After all, I can't give him taxation without representation. Don't deprive him. He's your husband. Don't I make you happy? Yes. Do you have any complaints? I want to hear you say you love me. I love you. And feel it. When I sleep with Leo, I feel like i'm committing adultery. If I divorce him, will you marry me? Yes or no? Oh. See how easy that is? Sandra, stop picking. - Now hold still. - Stop it. Isn't she beautiful, mama? - She was beautiful at her first wedding. - Thank you, mama. They're waiting for US, Leona. Leona: So what's the problem, mama? You don't like Joe? Sure, I like Joe. - But he's not as rich as Sandra's husband, right? - Leave it alone, Leona. Joe's got a lot of money, mama. More than Leo had. - Sandra: What's the difference? - You love him? - Did you love papa when you married him? - That's different. It was tradition. I feel sorry for Joe. Mama! Everybody's waiting. Leona: I'll be right there. Leave US alone for a minute, will you? Leona. Jay, show your aunts where to sit now. - Sure. Aunt Sylvia? - You're such a doll. You're wasting your breath here. Go. All right, mama. What is so wrong with me that one day out of my life you can't even give me the same attention or approval that you give Sandra? Or even Sylvia? - Sylvia's sick, she-- - Sylvia's fat! - A diabetic needs special-- - I need too! Maybe that's the problem. You need too much. Leona rosenthol needs it all. And nobody's got that much to give. [ Door opens ] Mama, come on. I'll be right there. Go ahead. You're jealous of me, aren't you? You have always been jealous of me. You wasted your life in the ghetto. You just sat back, and you let the poverty wash over you. Well, I am not gonna wind up like you. I am not gonna wind up out of breath in a fourth-floor walkup. That is the difference between you and me. You've just accepted your life, and you hate the fact that I won't. I wish you happiness, Leona. As much as I've had in my life that you think I've wasted. - All right, Joe, we'll see you outside. - All right. - Are you sure you don't want help with this? - No, I got this one. You'll get the next one. Excuse me, sir. I don't want to embarrass you, but occasionally people like to steal the silver salt-shakers. Really? I would be glad to put it on your bill. Well, wait a minute. We didn't steal, uh-- why would we? Let me check with my friends first. Of course. The maitre d' just stopped me. He told me that-- well, he said one of US took some silver salt shakers. - That's ridiculous. - Well, that's what I told him, but he insists. The fact is, they're gone. Man: But we certainly don't need to steal salt shakers, none of US. Leona? I don't have them. - You charge them to me? - Very well, sir. You shouldn't have paid him. They don't know I have them. They don't know. You should have just denied it. They can't prove it. Lumberton, north Carolina? The dye company I bought is down there. We'll have to live there for a while. There is not a chance in hell I am gonna live in lumberton. - We have to. - Joe, I would divorce you first. I thought you would. And you still did it? Yes. That's abandonment. I will take you for every cent. No, you won't. You're refusing to come with me, remember? I wouldn't worry about it. You're a beautiful woman, Leona. You have a way of making men like me feel handsome. We'll pay almost anything to feel like that. Almost anything. There'll always be some man somewhere who's willing to give you whatever you want just to have you in his bed. I don't need your damn wallet, Joe. I will do just fine on my own. If I could stay married to you, I can do anything. [ Door slams ] - Excuse me. - May I help you? The whole city is gonna go co-op. Listen to me. Listen to me! The time is gonna come when living in Manhattan is gonna be like living in a private community-- only for the rich. Woman: Excuse me, miss Roberts? Hold on a minute. Well? I think there's a young man to see you. You think? He's asking for a Leona rosenthol. I told him we have a Leona, but her name is Roberts. Shall I ask him to leave? I'll call you back. - Hi. - Hi, Jay. I'm gonna take you for an elegant lunch. Great. This is it? This is how you come to see me? Where's your blazer? Of course they know I have a son. They just don't know how old you are. Jay: How old do they think I am? Leona: Jay, I needed the job, so I told them I had a son to support, one that was young enough to be in the free-lunch program at school. There's no free-lunch program in college. There is in grade school. Oh, mother! How old do they think you are? Younger than springtime. [ Both laughing ] So what's up? I'm getting married. - You can't be. - Why not? You're only eight years old. - Oh! - [ Both laugh ] - Is he in? - Yes. Would you ask if I could see him, please? Whom shall I say is calling? Rosenthol or Roberts? Just buzz him, honey. - [ Intercom buzzes ] - Yes? Secretary: Leona Roberts is here to see you, Mr. Nederland. Yeah, send her in. Leona. - Mr. Nederland. - Sit down. Thank you. You're looking marvelous today. I tell the others, "look after yourself the way Leona does, - and you'll be a success here." - Oh, well, I try. After all, sales is image and you have the right image. Well, I'm more than image, Mr. Nederland. I've got experience. I started here a year ago as a receptionist. Now I have my real-estate license, and I'm one of the best producers in this office, and I did it all on my own. I'm well aware of your record. Then make me the sales agent for the park cinq. [ Chuckles ] You are hungry, aren't you? Park cinq is a test case for every co-op in New York. If we can sell the park cinq, every landlord, every apartment, will be lined up to convert. And I can sell those apartments faster than anybody in this office and you know it. Have you seen these? Pictures of my new apartment? No. - Oh, the dining room? - Mm-hmm. That's very nice. This is the library. Mmm. Very nice. What do you think of the bedroom? I don't see it. You'll just have to come up and see it then, won't you? It's got mirrors on the walls and ceiling. Come on, come on, come on! It will take me just one second. Thank you. The bedroom. I'm sure that's your main-- I heard about you guys. Yeah, I heard about you all the way back east. Go on in. I'll be right in there. Get my purse, please. Could you get me my purse, please? I'll be right there. Thank you very much. Some of you had the privilege of working under me at the park cinq, and you made a lot of money. Well... This building is a new challenge, and I expect each and every one of you to meet that challenge, because your record reflects on mine. - [ Door opens ] - Man: Excuse me! Excuse me. Excuse me! Whoa whoa whoa. Who are you, the delivery boy? Yeah, you're the warden? That's right, baby. And if you're working for me, you're late and may be fired. Well, first of all, I'm late because there was a fire on the b.M.T., and secondly, you're not gonna fire me because I'm gonna be your best salesman. Now, where's my desk? And I guess that's yours, so let's see. That oughta do it. Do what? I hear you're very good at snapping your fingers. This way, we can't see each other. You won't have to snap, and I won't have to ignore you. We're gonna get along just fine. Your tie is too wide. And in the right light, your earrings could signal the entire seventh fleet. Leona Roberts. Paul summerton. [ Ballroom music playing ] - Which one is he? - He's married, Leona. I don't care. Nederland will be jealous. [ Chuckles ] Hmm. Table number 11. See the man on the left? Mustache with glasses. See him? Yeah. Wish me luck. He's the one who's gonna need it. Be right back. If you take Roosevelt island as an example... Easy access to Manhattan for commuters. It's a gold mine. Just wait. - Mr. Helmsley? - Yes? I'm Leona Roberts. Would you care to dance? I hear you're the best. Excuse me, gentlemen. You've taken lessons. No, I just follow. Something tells me, miss Roberts, that you never "just followed" in your life. That's because I never found anybody who could lead. Been a long time since I've enjoyed myself so much. Thank you, miss Roberts. You're welcome, Mr. Helmsley. So when are you two kids tying the knot? Oh, stop it. I'll tell you, baby, it is like meeting Joe DiMaggio. Harry Helmsley? Yeah, I mean it. It's true! It's my dream. He's my hero. - Harry Helmsley? - Harry Helmsley. Harry Helmsley owns more of Manhattan than any single man since the Indians sold it. He is self-made, he's clever, he's a great dancer. A perfect gentleman. Very attractive. - Too bad he's married. - So was your last husband. Leo was never married before. I'm not talking about Leo. I'm talking about Joe. There was no Joe. Joe lubin, Leona, your second husband. I was married once to Leo panzirer, the father of my son. Aha. So you're rewriting your resume, huh? That's right. And if you keep my secrets, I'll keep yours. I hope you'll both be very happy. [ Both laugh ] You know something? I think we will. Man: She's considered to be one of the leading real-estate brokers in the city, certainly a leader in converting rentals into co-ops and both "the New York times" and "the post" have done profiles on her. - [ Intercom buzzes ] - Yes? Secretary: Excuse me, Mr. Helmsley, but a miss Leona Roberts is here to see you. She doesn't have an appointment, but she insists on seeing you. I'll bet she does. Show her in. Thank you, Ron. Good work. You're welcome, sir. Mr. Helmsley, I presume. Miss Roberts. Woman: This is all so confusing. Woman #2: I know. Okay, let me explain it to you, all right? Under state law, if a landlord wants to convert his buildings from rentals to co-ops, he needs 35% of his tenants to agree. Now if he gets the 35%, then those that don't want to buy can be evicted, their apartments sold right out from under them. But listen, if they don't get the percentage they need, then they can't go co-op, and we get to keep our apartments. - Woman: That's not what they told me. - Who? Miss Roberts. Her. According to her, I could lose my apartment in 30 days. All I said was it was smart to buy your apartment at the buyout price now. She said I could get evicted. It's true. I'm trying to protect you. I can't afford to buy my apartment. The banks don't give loans on co-ops. It'd take all my savings. I'm on a fixed income. If I lose my apartment, where do I go? Wait, now everybody, listen, okay? Co-op conversions have been happening all over the city and up until now, tenants have run scared, signing over their apartments out of fear. But now we are organizing. We have a tenants' committee, and I assure you that if we stand together, we will win. - Okay? - [ Applause and cheering ] The tenants voted US down. What's worse, it happened in two other buildings that Harry put me in charge of. I never had a failure with nederland. Now it's happened three times in a row. Don't sweat it. I know of an opening if you need a job. Oh, honey, Harry would never fire me now. It's much too late for that. [ Doorbell chimes ] Well? What do you think? Beautiful, just beautiful. I've never ever felt this way before. You're the most beautiful thing I've ever-- shh. You deserve it, Harry. You're the king. Leona: Good morning, mama. Look what I got you. Your favorites. And... Cotton. What do you think? Hmm? Perfect for spring. Did I tell you, mama? Jay is divorcing Myrna, gonna marry some girl I don't even know. [ Chuckles ] But you'd be proud of me. I am working for Harry Helmsley. He owns almost all of New York, and I am his best saleswoman. I've even been written up in "the New York times." Yeah, your little girl. Mama, remember when you told me nothing would ever be enough for me? Maybe you were right, but is that so bad? I mean, I've always gotten almost everything I went after. Almost everything. But all my life, the one thing I wanted Was for you to look at me first. But I've always been the last-- the last. I could never figure out what I did wrong. Mama? Mama! Look at me. Do you see me? Do you know it's me? Mama. Mama. Harry: As you can see, my wife Eve and I have taken the top two floors of the park Lane hotel and converted them into a 10-room duplex with a pool on the top floor. Beautiful, don't you think? The park Lane is the first luxury hotel to be built in Manhattan in seven years. There are 47 stories, 640 rooms, and it's the tallest structure on central park south. I want you to know the credit all goes to my wife Eve. That's all true. Come here. Come on. Eve is a quaker. Quakers tend to stay out of the limelight. Quakerism teaches you to stay in the background, not boast about what you have-- like a good husband. Park Lane is Eve Helmsley's hotel. They're both pretty special, don't you think? Now, if you'll follow US, we'll take you to the pool. Eve: Harry gets his exercise by swimming. He loves to swim every morning. - I prefer walking. - On water, no doubt. Ooh, you are acting like a jealous schoolgirl, and on a woman your age, it's not quite becoming. - I don't know why I like you. - Oh yes, you do. I'm the only one who knows that inside that rough exterior of yours, there's an even rougher one on the-- I know your game, I know your next move. I can call foul even before you hit the ball. Keep me your friend, Leona. You don't want me walking behind you. I'm gonna get him. You are looking at one very determined broad who is gonna knock a quaker queen off her throne. Miss Roberts, you can't go in there. Mr. Helmsley is in conference. Lunchtime. Excuse US, gentlemen. Leona, we're right in the middle of a meeting. It can wait. You know what time it is, Harry? It's 10 minutes after 1:00. That's right, so? From now on, lunchtime is at 1:00 sharp. - Excuse US, gentlemen. - Harry? Sorry. Maybe we can finish this off after lunch. Skim milk, vitamins, fruit group, and skinless breast of chicken. [ Laughs ] Lee, this is all very nice of you, but you can't just bust into my office like this. Harry, do you know how attractive you are? No. You're tall, you got a great physique, you're quick, you're alert, you got power. But you gotta start taking care of yourself. I'm not talking about swimming. I know you do that every morning. I am talking about a maintenance schedule-- eating properly. Look at this chicken breast. So your body knows that it can depend upon you to take care of it. I baked that this morning. So from now on, lunch is at 1:00 sharp. Dinner is at 8:00. Not 9:00, not 7:00. 8:00. But I have meetings, obligations to fulfill. The only obligation you have is to keep yourself healthy and fit. Please don't fight me in this. You are so adorable. No, not now, Harry. Now you eat. Come, darling. [ Laughing ] Want me to cut that for you? There, my sweetheart. Here. Eat. 65 signatures? That's four more than we needed. Well, file the papers immediately. No, now. Right now. - Secretary: Ms. Roberts? - No calls. - But there's a Mr. Benjamin schecter-- - I said no calls. Are you deaf or you stupid? Do that again and you're fired. I'm sorry. Ms. Roberts is in a meeting at the moment. May I take a message? It's not 1:00 yet, is it? I did it, Harry. 345 east 56th street went co-op. 65 tenants signed. Four more than we needed. It's a birthday present just for you. That's wonderful! Wonderful! You're wonderful. Lock the door, Harry. I've got another present for you. I gave Sylvia all of mama's furniture. I hope you don't mind. No, she needs it. Besides, she has no taste. I was wondering if you wanted mama's watch. No. You keep it. Besides, she always wanted you to have it anyhow. I love him. I'm good for him, and he knows it. You should see US dance together. It's as if we've been dancing together all our lives. Everybody says so. Everybody says so. You want this? No. We're good for each other. It's me, sweetheart. My god, you're beautiful. Oh, you make me beautiful. Tonight is very special. Veal in white wine and lemon sauce, - asparagus-- - look at all these flowers. Harry, come here. Give me your jacket. I have a surprise for you. Where did they come from? - Here, sweetheart. - I didn't send them. Put this on. Give me your arm. Come on. Harry, feel this. Doesn't this feel like butter? Nice, nice. Thank you. You look so handsome. Let me put on another record. Who's Vincent? I thought I put that with the box. What are you talking about? Who the hell is Vincent? Did the roses come from him? Harry, I didn't know what to do. I mean, when the first ones came, I threw them out, but then he just-- he kept sending more flowers. - Give me that. - Harry! I said give it to me. He wants you to move to Atlanta. He wants me to marry him. He's given me 10 days to make up my mind. - Have you been seeing him all the time-- - oh, Harry. I met him long before I met you. It didn't mean anything, not as far as I was concerned. At first he sent letters, and then-- then the flowers. I love you, Harry. But I am not gonna be somebody that you see two or three nights a week and then-- then you go home to your wife. Lee, we've talked about this before, about my being married to Eve for 33 years-- has she been your lover, Harry? Does she make you feel the way I do? No. But there's more to marriage than just-- well. Then there's something else you ought to see. You can't be serious. He's devoted to me. Well, so am I. You're married. For 33 years. - Are you happy, Harry? - For 33 years, Lee. Are you happy, Harry? I don't see how I can possibly tell her that-- she's such a gentle woman. So kind, so-- we're very comfortable with one another. For over 33 years, we've done everything together. Including growing old. I love you, Harry. But I am not gonna be your mistress anymore. If we can't be together all the time, then I am gonna move. I am gonna go to Atlanta because it will be too painful to stay here and watch you become an old man because it's comfortable. Life's too short, Harry. Don't you think? [ Phone ringing ] Sandra on phone: Hello? Leona: He bought it, Sandra. The letter, the phony ring, the whole bit. - He's getting a divorce. - Sandra: Congratulations. Leona: I'll get the ring back to you next week. Sandra: Keep it. It's just cheap costume jewelry. I'm surprised Harry couldn't tell it was a fake. Leona: Harry wouldn't know a fake if it hit him across the face. Sandra: That's obvious, Leona. Good night. [ Phone line disconnects ] The state Attorney General has filed a motion with the Manhattan state supreme court to enjoin the owners of 345 east 56th street from selling their 172 apartments. He charges that the owners of the building-- that's me, Leona, and their sales brokers, that's you-- get to the point. Go ahead. You explain it to her. He charges that you obtained your 35% quota by loading the building with sham sales to friends and relatives who never had any intention of buying. He further claims that you harassed tenants who refused to sell. Bottom line is that he's asked the court to declare the co-op conversion null and void, and he's demanded that you be permanently barred from selling cooperatives in the state of New York. That is not going to happen. Will it, Harry? I mean, we're not talking about Leona Roberts here. We're talking about the future Mrs. Helmsley. You are the most important man in this city. Even the mayor walks in your shadow. Harry, you're not gonna let this happen. Excuse US, please. You're the king, Harry. They can't treat you like this. We practically support this city on the taxes you pay. Somebody out there owes you a favor. Now you pick up the phone, and you collect it. [ Dialing phone ] And I want that lawyer fired. By the authority vested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. - Look up, look up. - Mm-hmm. Busy busy busy. Watch your step. Well well well, look what the cat dragged in. - Mrs. Helmsley. - Where have you been? Don't you ever talk to your office? I've been trying to reach you for days. I was on a buying trip with some other clients, Mrs. Helmsley. It wasn't possible to return your call. Oh, it wasn't possible. Well, you should have made it possible. I pay you plenty, buster. And when I wanna talk to you, I don't care where you are, you get back to me pronto. I'm here now, Mrs. Helmsley. What's the problem? These chairs are the problem. But those are the chairs you had me bid on at the auction. Well, the paper said the whole lot were second-rate, and anybody knowledgeable would have passed on them. You told me to bid on them. You should have known better. And there is no way that I am taking some second-rate antiques. Just what do you expect me to do with them? - [ Laughs ] - Paul: Leona. Well, I don't care what you do with them, but they are not staying here, and I am not paying for them. You're quite right, Mrs. Helmsley. There's only room in this apartment for one second-rate antique. You shall be hearing from my lawyer. Oh, oh! [ Laughing ] I'm glad you think that's so funny. Oh, come on. It was a hell of a good line, and frankly, you deserved it. If you weren't so full of yourself you'd be breaking up now too. There is no way I'm gonna let some little jerk who works for me get away with that. He tried to make a fool of me. Let it go, Leona. Why shouldn't I be tough? Nobody ever gave me anything till Harry. Why should I let anybody get away with anything? You are always tough. That's one of the things I like about you, - but you used to be fair. - I'm still fair. No, you're mean now, Leona. There's a difference. What kind of friend are you? You only liked it when I was taking it? You don't like it when I dish it? I don't like it either way. I'm the kind of friend who's not afraid to tell you so. How many of those do you have left? Well, I like the green. Mrs. Helmsley, they go with your eyes. [ Laughs ] Well, the bracelet is nice. Yes, this is our finest set. But the earrings are too small. - Do you have something larger? - Larger. - [ Intercom buzzes ] - Secretary: Excuse me, Mrs. Helmsley? I told you I did not want to be disturbed. But Mrs. Helmsley, it's about your son. I don't care what it's about. One more interruption - and you're outta here. - He's had a heart attack, Mrs. Helmsley. [ Beeping ] Leona: I talked to your aunt Sandra. She sends her best, whatever that is. And your aunt Sylvia is sending brownies. You know her answer to everything is sugar. You could have prepared me, you know. I didn't plan on this. I'm talking about those people out there. You got a new wife, you got new kids. You haven't spoken to me in three years. I don't know why. Jay... We need to be more close. In a few weeks, when you're feeling better, I'm gonna talk to Harry about you coming to work for US. You'd look younger with a toupee. So, what do you want me to do about it? Make Jay president of deco incorporated. - What?! - He'll stay in Orlando. You don't even have to see him. [ Chuckles ] Lee... Deco does all the purchasing for the hotels. Jay can do that. How can he do that? He's had no experience with that sort of thing. Harry, you like being seen with me? You like the way you feel with me? I am no dried-up little quaker sitting on my ass knitting doilies. I have made you look 20 years younger. I've made you feel 20 years younger. Harry, you owe me. Don't you think you've had enough? Vodka with a twist. Double. Excuse me. Mr. Helmsley? I'm Deborah pauley, and I know this is terribly gauche, but I saw you and Mrs. Helmsley on the dance floor a while ago and well, my husband would kill me, but he's not a very good dancer, and i-- I love the samba. Mrs. Helmsley, would you mind very much if I asked your husband to dance? There's not a chance in hell that's gonna happen, honey. Harry: That young lady was so charming and so innocent. Leona: Innocent?! You are more innocent than she is. Harry: Oh yeah? Well, let me ask you something. Damn it to hell! Don't keep walking away from me. - I am trying to talk to you! - If I am so vulgar, why don't you crawl back to your sweet, simple Eve? Don't think that hasn't crossed my mind. At least I had some peace then. I could fight my battles in the office, but home was like a sanctuary-- - calm and peaceful. - It was killing you. You were becoming an old man. Sometimes you suffocate me. In public, you grab ahold of me like a jealous schoolgirl. You comb my hair, pick the lint off my jacket. You treat me like-- I treat you like you are the center of my universe. [ Groans ] When I'm with you, it's-- it's as if everything else is out of focus. You're right. I don't want anybody else near you. And I would be perfectly willing to kill anybody who tried to take you away from me. Harry. Harry! If anything happened to you, I would die. Together, we're immortal. We make magic. Everything I do I do for you. So you better decide, Harry-- what is it you really want? Sweet, simple Eve or me? Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure you're all wondering why I called you here today. Well, it's for a very special reason-- the unveiling of our plans to build the most magnificent hotel New York has yet to see. I give you the palace hotel. As this model clearly shows, we've kept our promise. We've done everything possible to preserve and restore this exquisite villa by connecting it to the tower behind. The palace will be the finest hotel in New York. No expense will be spared. Now I want to introduce you to the woman who will not only oversee the creation of this magnificent hotel, but will also be president of the newly-formed Harley hotels across the country-- Leona Helmsley. [ Applause ] I want to know what we can throw out, what we can keep. Okay, what you wanna do is preserve the interior to the fullest possible extent because of the historic nature. The cubicles the church put in-- they can go. - Mark, are you taking notes? - Yes, ma'am. The gold room, thank god, is pretty much the way it was. And the chandelier's intact. - But in here-- Mrs. Helmsley? - Huh? In here, we're talking millions of dollars. I know that, Sarah. I don't care about that. The rag. Now, I have the highest possible standards. If we are gonna spend millions of dollars redecorating and restoring this hotel, then I want only the best from you. If you're up to that, you've got the job. Oh, I'm up to it, Mrs. Helmsley. Good. Oh, good. Bring a pad, Mark. Come on, Sarah. As you know, Mrs. Helmsley, part of the condition of appointing your son vice president of deco incorporated was that I supervise all bookkeeping, - invoices, transactions. - Yes, Stanley. Since your son had little experience in this field, Mr. Helmsley felt that in-house regulations be put into effect. Leona: Stanley, are you going to get to the point eventually, or should I order lunch? Your son is ripping off your husband, Mrs. Helmsley. The Helmsley corporation is being double-billed, sometimes triple-billed for furnishings and services ordered by deco. For a 200-room hotel, he orders furnishings for 300 rooms. The surplus is then sold to another chain and Jay pockets the difference. Now I understand he's in daily contact with you. Of course he is. He's my son. Well, I'll look into it. - That'll be all. - All right. Oh, have you told Harry about this yet? Not yet. Don't bother. I'll tell him myself. Oh, and Stanley... Yes? You're fired. Mark! - Mark! - Yes, Mrs. Helmsley? Get me my son. He's in London. - You know the number. - Yes, ma'am. - I gave you that job as a gift. - Leona: Harry-- do not interrupt me, Leona. Your mother said you needed a job. You needed taking care of. I took care of you, didn't I? - Didn't I? - Yes. Vice president of deco with one job to do, one simple job. What was that job, Jay? Give me a job description. To organize and supervise the purchasing and installation of all the furnishings for the Harley and Helmsley hotels. - No other hotels, no other chains? - Yes, sir. Then what the hell is this?! Harry, there is no need to scream at him. I'll scream at whomever I damn well please, including you if you don't shut up and sit down. Well? Jay: It's our catalogue. I've been around a long time, hotshot. I know all the schemes. Half of them I invented. And no snot-nosed little brat is gonna get away with double-ordering, double-billing, and selling furnishings that I've already paid for to other hotels and then pocketing the difference! Jay would never do such a thing. Why not? He's your son, isn't he? Yeah, you've been pretty clever. Somehow you've managed to sidestep Stanley on most of this. Well, no more. From now on, he's gonna be breathing right down your neck. You're gonna have to get his approval on every damn thing you do, even when you go to the toilet. You understand?! And he'll send me copies of every purchase order, every memo, every scribble that you make. How will I explain that to my staff? You've had three heart attacks. Tell them that your stepfather is concerned about your health and sent someone down to help you out. And Leona, I'm rehiring Stanley permanently. Now get this straight, both of you: Just one more time, one more thing like this, and you're both out on your asses! Oh! I apologize for interrupting your honeymoon, Mimi. I wish you both happiness. Thank you. As you know, I am a very determined person. And I determined long ago that I was gonna marry a man so powerful that just by being his wife, I would command absolute attention and respect. Well... I have done that. I have done better than Sandra. I have done better than Sylvia. I have done better than most women would ever dream possible. And if you think, as my son, that you can do anything to destroy that, you are gravely and sadly mistaken. Now if you ever do anything again that puts my marriage in danger, I will hang you out to dry. You're not going to be an anonymous manager, Mrs. Helmsley. Absolutely. You are this hotel. You've been the focal point in all the press. That's right. - Oh, Mark, make a note. - Yes, ma'am. Harry woke up with a backache this morning. Yes, ma'am. Remind me to call the mattress supplier. I warned him if my Harry could not sleep, we were changing brands in every hotel, in every room. Damn right I am not an anonymous manager. Absolutely. Now what do you think of this? Instead of running a single full-page ad for publication, we're going to go with three smaller ads in a row-- each one in the upper right-hand corners of successive pages, all of them featuring you, of course. Beautiful gowns, jewelry. Mark that down. I get to pick the jewelry. I get to pick the jewelry, and I get to pick the gowns. I call it the "why should you?" Campaign. - [ Knocking on door ] - Will you get that? Yeah. Here's one under a picture of you that says, "I won't settle for skimpy towels. Why should you?" - Well, I wouldn't. - Exactly. And in this one, the copy reads, "I couldn't get along without a phone in the bath. Why should you?" - Perfect. - Tea? No, thanks. The airline publications are giving US three pages at least and we're going nationwide-- newspapers, magazines, week after week, all featuring the same headline with your picture under it: "The only palace in the world where the queen stands guard." I love it. You're a genius. No, it's great. I couldn't be happier. Mark, get them outta here. Wait a second. - Don't touch your food. - What's wrong? Close the door. Close the door! Look at your lettuce. There are water droplets on the lettuce. - You're kidding. - How dare you do this? How dare you do this?! - Mrs. H., it's fine. - It is not fine. The palace does not serve wet lettuce. Not in my hotels. You are lucky I do not fire every damn one of you. Now get the hell out. Go on, out out out. Go on, Mark. Out! Close the door! Where was I? Oh, yeah. Something I want to show you. See this? Pictures of the royal family. That's what I want. My picture on 52 cards. We can sell them for mementos at the hotel. What do you think? Well, I think it's a terrific idea. Mama's on her way. Thanks. Mama's on her way. Mama's on her way. Mama's on her way. Mama's on her way. Mama's coming. She wants to start in the dining room. Now what's wrong here? Hmm? Come on, come on. Matches. Where are the damn matches? Every ashtray is supposed to have matches. Now get them. Hey, I'm the only one who snaps fingers around here, buster. [ Sighs ] - What is this? - It's being repaired. No no, that's dirt. How do you repair dirt? Now tonight's the grand opening. Get that carpet cleaned. And I want every square inch of carpet in this hotel checked. - Understood? - Yes, ma'am. Okay, let's go. Matches? - Man: I'll get them. - Leona: Oh, good. You got them. You've got nothing to do? There are no guests yet, Mrs. Helmsley. I don't pay people to do nothing. Get his name. You'll be lucky if you last six months with me, young man. - Only the best last with me. - Guard: Yeah, uh-huh. Well, what did he say? - Uh-huh. - Hang up. Are you a security guard? Why aren't you at your post? - I'm on my break. - Was this a personal call? Yes. - You're fired. - But-- Mrs. Helmsley, the man has five children. If he kept his pants on, he wouldn't have a problem, would he? He's fired. Well, what do you think? Oh, you've done a great job. Well, thank you, kind sir. - You ready for tonight's opening? - Sarah, I have some bad news. - Leona sent me down here with a message. - What? You're fired. [ Laughing ] What? For what? You know the lady. You've done your job and she wants to take the credit for it. She doesn't want you around taking the focus off of her. But I designed this whole lobby-- the hallways, the lights, the fabrics. No, you haven't. The queen has decided that you don't exist. You never have. I'm sorry. [ Ballroom music playing ] Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. The king and queen of the Helmsley palace. [ Band playing "I'm just wild about Harry" ] Everybody dance. [ Door opens ] I found theart. - What? - Our house. Wait till you see it. I am so excited. It'll be my first real house. What do you mean, first house? Well, you know. We've always lived in apartments or condominiums or hotels. I mean, this will be my first real house. It has trees and a big lawn and it only costs $11 million. Harry: $11 million?! Leona: Furnished, Harry. Furnished! I am having a clock made for Harry's birthday in the shape of the Helmsley building. It's gonna cost a little over $43,000, but we can charge it off to the business, right? I mean, after all, we are the business, aren't we? The I.R.S. Can't object. Don't worry about the I.R.S. You're covered. All these invoices you and Harry are initialing I've got them all billed to either the graybar building, the Helmsley building, the Harley hotels-- all buried in their accounts charged off to deco incorporated. So it's all a business expense. Not only do you not pay for any of it, - it's a tax write-off. - Why not? Only the little people pay taxes, right? - Lee. - Dreamboat. What are you doing home so early? Good, we can talk about the pool enclosure, - because I just found out-- - Lee. - What? - Jay's had another heart attack. Where is he? Take me to him. [ Sobbing ] It's too late. He died over an hour ago. Oh, Harry. Take me out of here. Now it all makes sense. What? I wondered why that precious daughter-in-law of mine had to rush back to Orlando after the funeral. What are you talking about? She left New York before Jay was even cold in his grave. She did not sit Shiva, she did not stand by US as a family, and now she is claiming she has a legal right to take over deco. That's impossible. We own the business. Well, she is trying to jump in and grab it. Now we are going to have to lock her out, and we're gonna have to move fast. Okay, I'll get a court order. No! I want a lock on everything tonight. She did not honor Jay, and I'm gonna teach her a lesson - she will not forget. - Okay. I want her evicted from the house. I want-- I want her and the kids out of the house. Okay, but where are they going to live? I don't care! Jay is dead, and as far as I'm concerned, she killed him. No, Lee... Your son died with his pants down in a hotel room with another woman. Well, if she were a better wife, it wouldn't have happened. I want her out of my life. Harry! What is it? What's wrong? Harry? Huh? What? What happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. Nothing. Nothing. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Did you ever play 52 pickup, may? I thought you loved the playing cards. You personally approved every photograph of yourself. You picked the colors, the style of the numbers. Leona, we have printed up 10,000 decks of cards here. We've packaged them, we've wrapped them in cellophane, we've spent a year designing the damn-- excuse me. These cards have been made to your specifications, and it's too late to change them now. They're too small. They're regular cards. Harry plays with pinochle cards, and they're larger. My picture is on those cards, and I want it to look right. These cards are gonna go in my hotels. I wanna make sure they look like they belong, so I want them larger, and I want the edges gold-leafed. Gold leaf? You said you didn't want gold leaf. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. I gave you that option, and you specifically said you didn't want it. No arguments. I'll get right on it. Oh, and may? Every time you send a messenger with your ad copy, it costs me $5.95. Don't you think mailing it makes more sense? Whatever you say. - [ Door slams ] - [ Sighs ] Well? Pick those up. Don't just stand there. Pick those up. Pick them up yourself. While you're at it, pick that up, too. Hold on just a second. Ransdell, pick up 8086. - Something about the helmsleys. - Thanks. Hello? Woman: Are you interested in winning a pulitzer prize? [ Chuckles ] Of course. I'm serious. If you meet me tonight, I assure you you'll win a pulitzer prize. That's good salesmanship, but what's this all about? The helmsleys. They're thieves. Meet me tonight and I'll tell you the whole story. First tell me a little bit more. For instance, their mansion in Connecticut-- they've built a brick- and-marble enclosure for their outdoor swimming pool. It's the finest that money can buy, and it didn't cost them a penny. They dummied up a bunch of expenses, a bunch of bills, and sent them to the graybar building and the Helmsley building for payment. The helmsleys personally initialed a million dollars' worth of these fake invoices. And you're gonna love this: Included is a $12.95 bloomingdale girdle. - A business expense. - [ All laughing ] She tried to fill a table for a charity event and couldn't find one person to join them. They had to fill it with business acquaintances. Man: If they come home at 3:00 in the morning, the staff has to get out of bed, get dressed and stand outside until they drive up. Once they go upstairs, the staff can go back to bed. I've heard her sit down with Mr. Helmsley, man #2: Go through a list of his associates, make him feel insecure, and then demand that he fire them. But I'll tell you something: I think he's had some strokes. Woman: He's slower. Sometimes he drifts. You know, I think she takes advantage of that. She once threatened to fire one of the housekeepers because the sheets weren't ironed to her satisfaction. She said the crease kept her awake all night. Al, you said you needed more proof. Well, you got it. Take a look at this: You got $250,000 worth of invoices all charged to the helmsleys' office buildings and hotels. But it's really for goods and services for carpets, chandeliers-- you name it-- installed at the helmsleys' mansion in greenwich, Connecticut. And Harry and Leona's initials are on every single invoice. "H.b.h., l.M.H." It's unbelievable. Leona! The state Attorney General has indicated that in addition to federal charges, he may initiate state charges. We've done nothing wrong. Former employees have come forth and accused you - of being tyrannical. - Why don't you print the good news? Where's the story that Harry and I donated $33 million to New York hospital? Or that in the last five years, we have paid $340 million in taxes? That's over a quarter of a billion dollars. How much did you pay? I have a search warrant pertaining to certain records on file here. - Man: Harry, I want to speak to you. - Woman: Mr. Helmsley! Please, please, clear the doorway. Mr. Helmsley, you've spent a lot of years in real estate. What do you consider your greatest accomplishment? I married her. Woman: Leona, Harry, just a few more questions, please! Just a few more minutes of your time. He's been found incompetent to stand trial because of the strokes, memory loss. Well, then I'll have to face it alone. That's right. Up to now, we haven't had to face anything alone, have we, Harry? Sometimes you were such a boy. I had to straighten your tie. I had to smooth your hair. You would get so impatient with me. Right from that very first dance, we were perfect partners, weren't we, Harry? Oh, how we danced. Man: Leona. Leona. Leona, we're due in court for the verdict. I'll be right there. Are you all right? Wait till they see this performance. - Male reporter: Leona! - Female reporter: Leona! - Male reporter #2: Leona! - Male reporter #3: Mrs. Helmsley! [ Reporters clamoring ] Young Leona: Mama, mama, look at me. Look at me. Leona: Mama? Mama, look at me. [ Ballroom music playing ]
