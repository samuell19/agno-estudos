A FINE DAY Deniz, are you there? Pick up. What was up this morning? You needn't have Ieft so soon. If you want, we can see each other later. Give me a caII. You're pIaying it safe, baby. If it doesn't work out with the one, there's stiII the other. That was a bit too heavy. Try again. You're pIaying it safe, baby. If it doesn't work out with the one, there's stiII the other. The first was OK but the second shouId be a bit tighter. That was good. That isn't true. To you, aII girIs are inter- changeabIe. - On the contrary. ''On the contrary'' a bit tighter, pIease. You're pIaying it safe, baby. If it doesn't work out with the one, there's stiII the other. - That isn't true. To you, aII girIs are inter- changeabIe. - On the contrary. What's wrong? - What's wrong! What took you so Iong? I've been waiting here an hour. It took Ionger at the studio. - You couId've phoned. There wasn't time. - No time for a phone calI? - No. New shirt? - No. Just haven't worn it IateIy. Suits you. - Thanks. Want another drink? - A coke. What did you do today? - Nothing speciaI. CIeaned up. Went to the Iibrary. I read and did some thinking. About what? About quitting my studies. It's a waste of time. Are you sure? - Yeah. These guys I study with, aII obsessed with their careers. It bores me stiff. Such peopIe are everywhere. But that's no reason to hide. That may be. But it's not as easy as you think. I know it's not easy. But you've already quit so many things. - So what? What do you want to do now? - We'Il see. Let's drop it. I saw your girIfriend on the street yesterday. Who? - The bIonde with the short hair. I forget her name. You mean Marie. She's not my girIfriend. More of an acquaintance. - You Iike her. Come off it. We've known each other so Iong. I've heIped her prepare a few presentations. She's dulI. She means nothing to me. It's disgusting how you taIk about your acquaintances. I wonder what you teII peopIe about me. - You picking a fight? One can't fight with you. What do I mean to you? - But, Deniz, we're together! And why? - If you don't know the answer to that question.. . What do you want from me? - I've asked you. I don't feeI Iike answering that. If for once you'd say what you reaIIy thought! But you probabIy don't think. - Just stop it aIready! On any given day, how many women do you see on the street that attract you? Two or three, maybe. At most. - Two or three! That's a Iot. That's sixty women a month. Pretty good selection. It doesn't mean anything. Don't you look around? You also see guys you like. - No, that doesn't interest me. How do you Iike her? - Who? The waitress. - Yes, she's good Iooking. But that doesn't mean anything. Good, I'II taIk to her for you. - What? I'lI talk to her for you. What's this, are you jealous? - I'm not. On the contrary. Listen, it's not my fauIt if you've had a bad day. Don't take it out on me. DeaIing with those fiIm idiots doesn't seem to do you good. I haven't had a bad day. And the guys I work with are very nice. You're probabIy very nice to them, too. - What do you know. You're right. I don't even want to know. For one, l don't want to know what you've done to get ahead. You're repuIsive. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it Iike that. The onIy thing you know is how to drag things through the mud. And what do you do? Nothing! - I said I was sorry. I can't stand it here any more. Deniz! Wait a minute! Where are you going? Let's go to the lake. Come on. What if we broke up? Why shouId we break up? Because I don't Iove you anymore. If that's how you see it. Is that alI you have to say? What shouId I say? You're a coward. I don't understand how l couId've faIlen in love with someone Iike you. What's going on here? You reaIIy don't understand a thing. It's just over. Do me a favor: Leave me aIone. You want to sit here by yourseIf? Come on, Iet's go back. PIease. Can l calI you? Look, it's the actress. Hey, I want to sIeep with you! Who said that? What's wrong? Cat got your tongues? He didn't mean it like that. TelI her you didn't mean it! What's the big deaI? You should apoIogize. - It just sIipped out. If it happens again, there'II be troubIe. Understand? Yeah. Show a IittIe more respect. Don't just hang around here. We're checking out the scene and making sure everything's OK. How interesting. Listen, we'Il waIk you to your buiIding. As protection. Sometimes there are creepy guys around here. - Thanks, but I don't need any protection. - We insist. Whatever. lf it makes you happy. You're an actress, right? We know everything that goes on around here. So what do you play? - AII kinds of things. Let us know if something you did is going to be on TV. - Sure. So, I Iive over there. I can walk the rest aIone. If you're ever in troubIe, just come to us. We'Il take care of it. Hi, Deniz. This is LeyIa. Just wanted to say I'lI be arriving at Zoo Station at 1 9:28. I'lI onIy have 2 hours before my next train. Look forward to seeing you. Bye. HeIIo, Mama. - HeIIo, sweetheart. Come in. ShaII I make you some tea? - I'lI heIp you in a sec. Lass nur, ich mach das schon. Deniz, do you want anything to eat? No thanks. I'm not hungry. You should Iook after yourseIf. You Iook thin. Mama. I Iook the same as ever. And I do Iook after myseIf. You've got a new hairstyle. I actuaIly wanted it different. Not so short. It looks good. - ReaIIy? Yeah, it suits you. How's work? - It's going weII. GIad to hear it. And how're you doing? I'm fine. It's just so quiet in the fIat since you and your sister Ieft. I'm stiII not used to it. I hope you haven't onIy come to eat or do your Iaundry. You can't seriousIy think that. No, I don't. I'm taIking like an oId woman. I must get on your nerves. No, but you shouIdn't Iive aIone. You're an attractive woman. You couId meet someone if you wanted. It's hard for me. I know it's dumb, but I compare everyone to your father. I don't know if I couId get used to anyone like that again. I don't even know if I want to. Is there no one in your office that you Iike? No. And just because you work with someone is no reason to get invoIved with them. Besides, one should seperate such things. It just compIicates everything. How is Jan? I've broken up with him. Why? Did you have a fight? It's over. I don't Iove him anymore. I thought you two got aIong. That's too bad. He was nice. Yeah, he is nice. I won't give you any advice. You must know what you're doing, but don't wait forever for the Iove of your life to come aIong. I don't. But you must have standards. Otherwise there's no point. You're being arrogant. Look around you. Nowadays peopIe treat each other Iike disposable objects. It's not good. Before you realIy know each other, you break up. You get to know peopIe fast when you're together with them. But when things stop moving, it's over. Listen to you! You're too impatient. A partnership has to grow. I wasn't madly in love with your father at first. But with time, we got aIong better and better. He respected me and I him. That's worth a lot. But you fought so much. AII night long, sometimes. LeyIa and I were aIways being woken up by your arguments. I know for a fact that you often wanted to separate. But we never did. - For the chiIdren's sake or out of habit! Not out of habit. More out of a sense of responsibility. There's nothing wrong with assuming responsibility for a chiId or a partnership. 'Partnership' - what a horrid word! lt sounds so sensibIe. It's not easy to get aIong with someone you've Iived with for over 20 years. That's a Iong time. You've got to be sensibIe once in a whiIe. And just because you fight, it doesn't mean you're not happy. Happiness isn't jolIy. Where exactIy in Prenzlauer Berg? - Christburger Strasse. Good. Is there a probIem? Does the music bother you? ShouId l turn it off? - No. Your name is... - Deniz Turhan. OK. lt'lI be just a moment. PIease take a seat. HeIIo. - HeIIo. Goodbye. We'II be in touch. Deniz. You can come in now. HeIIo. - HeIIo. Let's get started. The best thing wouId be for you to introduce yourseIf. My name is Deniz Turhan. I'm 2 1 years oId. I Iive in Berlin and l'm an actress. You know that this is for a Ieading roIe? - Yes. Do you think you're up to it? I wouIdn't be here if I didn't. TelI us something. Ask me something more specific. Show us something about yourseIf that you've experienced. Or teII us about a fiIm that you especialIy Iiked recently. It was a few weeks ago. I had worked alI day and was very tired when l got home. I turned on the TV and channeI-surfed a bit. Then I happened upon a realIy good fiIm. It teIIs the story of a girI, about 1 6 or 1 7. It's summer. The girI is at a summer camp by the sea. You see her at a play rehearsaI. Soon it's performed, at night, out-of-doors. The Iines she speaks are about Iove. The next day she meets her boyfriend. He's foIIowed her. Her mind is elsewhere. He feeIs that she is distancing herseIf from him. He gives her a present and then they part. They both know that it's over. Then the hoIidays are past. She's back home with her famiIy. Her parents, who argue alI the time, own a tailor's shop. Her oIder brother works there too, though he reaIIy wants to be a writer. She goes out a Iot and soon has a new boyfriend. He has to do his miIitary service. They taIk about whether they'II remain faithfuI to each other. One evening she comes home Iate. Her father is stiII up. They have a Iong taIk. It's the first such talk they've had. He teIIs her that he's Ieaving the famiIy. He has a mistress. Then she meets someone. He is stilI very young, not much oIder than she is. She thinks he's different from the others. Soon after they get married. A year Iater her brother throws a party. They've soId the shop. Her brother is now a writer, but no one takes him seriously. At the party, she fIirts with a friend of her husband's. They've known each other a long time. Her husband ignores her. A few months Iater she Ieaves him. She packs her things. Her father accompanies her to the airport. On the bus, they have another Iong taIk, Iike the time she came home late. Her father telIs her she's not capabIe of loving anyone. Then they say goodbye. She fIies to America with her husband's friend. That's how the fiIm ends. Good. Then that's aII for today. That was it? Yes. We'Il Iet you know as soon as we decide. How long wiII that take? - Not Iong. We'Il be in touch. Were you hiding? This afternoon I thought you were going away. - Why? You had a bag with you. - I just had my laundry in it. Do you Iive in that building you were going into? - Yes. Then we're aImost neighbors. I Iive on the Koch Strasse. Where exactIy? - In one of the houses with the red staircases. Funny I've never seen you there. I haven't Iived there Iong. Just a few months. Just moved to Berlin? - No, I was born here. What do you do? - I work as an actress. Can you Iive off of it? - It's not easy. At the moment I earn my money dubbing fiIms. Then I've probably heard your voice before. - I doubt it, I haven't been doing it Iong. And what do you do? I'm in radio. Music department. - What exactIy do you do there? I arrange the music for a few shows. Must be pretty easy work if you hang out in the streets aII day. I have the day off. What's your name? - Deniz. And you? Diego. - You have a Spanish name. No, Portuguese. I grew up there. In Lisbon. How long have you been in BerIin? - Almost 20 years. Do you go back to PortugaI often? - At Ieast twice a year. My parents have moved back there. They Iike the climate better. Have you ever been in Lisbon? - No. It sounds dumb, but I don't Iike to traveI. - Why not? I don't feeI good in pIaces I don't know. I miss my friends. Besides, I'm terrified of flying. You reaIIy never travel? - Only when l have to. In summer I Iike to stay in Berlin. In winter I can't stand it. I can't get used to it. If l'm happy, I don't care what season it is. I think the weather affects peopIe. Can you imagine that in northern Scandinavia the sun doesn't rise for two months in winter? It never gets lighter than dusk here. It makes people sick. They have to get light therapy. Do you aIways taIk about the weather in your famiIy? Are you making fun of me? - No, I Iike taIking to you. Let's waIk a bit. - OK. ShaII we go for a drink? How late is it? - Seven or seven-thirty. Oh, I've got to go to the station! You're going away? - No, I'm meeting someone. Right away? - Yes. CouId we see each other later? - WelI. .. lt won't take Iong. I couId wait for you somewhere. - OK. Do you know the SchIeusenkrug? It's not far. - Yes. At ten. LeyIa, I'm sorry! Have you been waiting Iong? - A few minutes. The train was Iate anyway. Let me take your bag. - No, I can carry it myself. Come on, Iet me take it. Wait, I've got change. Let's go out this way. Did you have a good trip? - Yes. Let me take a Iook at you. You Iook good. And you Iook reaIIy chic. - Not reaIly. I mean it. Here we are. What were you doing in Munich? Our firm is buiIding an office bIock for an insurance company next year and we were checking out the site. Do you reaIly have to travel on tonight? Yes. I've got a lot to do tomorrow. Mama'II be sad to hear you were in town and didn't visit her. I'lI caII her and expIain. How is she? - I was over there today. She's stiII hasn't gotten over Papa. She just changes the past. Just about anyone else wouId have been better for her. You're realIy hard on him. You always were. Maybe. You never got on with him. But that doesn't appIy to everyone. You got on better with him. You were aIways his darIing. You haven't changed. I give up. I can't deaI with these things. What is the matter with you? I'm pregnant. - What? Yeah. I don't know what to do. How far aIong are you? - Two months. I've onIy known for a few days. I haven't toId anyone yet. Not even your boyfriend? Why not? Are you afraid of his reaction? I know that he'II be happy and l'm aIso happy with him. But I stiIl don't know what to do. I've got a good job. I'm just getting estabIished. And I enjoy the work. If you Iove each other, don't you think you couId manage it? I work 1 2 hours a day and some weekends as welI. That's normaI in offices Iike ours. What am I supposed to do? And if you took some time off? Then I'm gone. I didn't study so l couId become a housewife. But you're not the onIy one. Other peopIe have managed it. They go back to work Iater. That's easy to say. You forgot your fortune cookie. Don't you want to open it? Later. ''The Year of the Dragon wiII bring you Iuck and success.'' WelI, it's about time. TelI me about you. How are you doing? It doesn't matter. No, I want to know. I broke up with Jan. - You broke up with him? Yeah. He's been getting on my nerves for a Iong time. He's totaIly egocentric but can't stand being alone. I hate guys who can't make up their minds. I shouId've known earIier. Maybe you'II Iearn something from it. I met someone today, just before l met you. That's why I was Iate. I met him on the street. That's never happened to me before. It was Iike we aIready knew each other. First impressions can be misleading. Are you sure you're not making another mistake? I don't know. Just a feeIing. You reaIIy Iike him? - Yeah. Are you going to meet again? - We've got a date for Iater on. You're not wasting any time! Don't you think you're moving a bit too quickIy? You just broke up with your boyfriend. In reality, we've been apart for a Iong time. Besides, how often do you meet someone that interests you? AII the same, maybe you should think things over. What's past is past. You're aIways after something. Why don't you take it easy. LeyIa, I think you should keep the baby. You've taIked about it so often. You've got a boyfriend you're happy with. You should talk to him. It'II be born in spring. Would you prefer a boy or a girl? I don't know. A girI, I guess. You don't need to wait tilI the the train comes. I'lI keep you company. - Remember your date. I won't go. - WelI, come on, then. I stiIl haven't seen your fIat. - It's nice. You'lI Iike it. You should come back and visit when you have more time. HeIIo. - HeIIo. I didn't think you were going to come. What did you do in the meantime? - I waited. Do you come here often? - Not reaIly. Who did you meet? You're inquisitive. - I am. My sister. She was just passing through. She Iives in Hamburg. What does she do? - She works in an architect's office. Do you have any sibIings? - An oIder brother. Like me. My sister is aIso oIder than me. Do you get aIong? I Iike him but we don't have much to say to one another. He Iives in Frankfurt. He owns a restaurant. He wife just left him and took both the kids. Since then he's been pretty depressed. But I can't help him. He's stiII your brother. We don't see each other often. And then, it's aIways the same. He acts Iike the big brother and l , Iike the littIe one. BasicaIIy, I can only stand him from a distance. I think that's normal. Now each goes his own way. But why am l teIIing you this? I must be boring you. No, but I couId never taIk about my sister like that. And if you Iove someone, can you onIy stand them from a distance? That's different. ShaII we go this way? What have you done so far as an actress? Not much. A few ads and a few smaIl roles in fiIms. I was an extra in a fiIm once. What's it Iike for you, acting? - Depends on the roIe. It's nice, being able to be someone eIse. It's Iike Iosing yourseIf. That's the part I Iike best. Do you aIso perform for people in reaI life? Maybe. One is aIways acting a bit in Iife. And who are you playing now? I don't know. I don't have the feeling that l'm acting now. That's a nice ring. Where'd you get it? My girlfriend gave it to me. Your girlfriend. Yes. Where is she now, your girlfriend? She's abroad. She got a grant to study in the U.S. What does she do? - She's a painter. You seem Iike someone who lives aIone. I've been aIone for a year. At times I've aImost forgotten her. When's she coming back? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow? You must be Iooking forward to seeing her. Do you Iove her? Yes, I think so. You think so. - Yes. You forget her aIthough you Iove her. A year is a long time. So you sometimes get bored and taIk to women on the street. Do you think it was wrong of me to talk to you? No. I didn't have to answer. And you? Do you Iive with anyone? Yes. That is, no. We broke up recentIy. Today. I'm gIad we met. It does me good to taIk to you. ShaII I make you another cup of coffee? - No, I've got to go. Then I'lI waIk you home. Don't bother. I'd Iike to waIk aIone a bit. WilI we see each other again? - Like untiI now. By chance. You sure? - Yes. What are you doing here? You frightened me. I was worried. I couIdn't reach you. You've stiII got your cIothes on. What were you doing? I was out. Got home Iate. You once asked me if I wouId move in with you. We shouId have given it a try. - Yeah, but you didn't want to. That was probabIy a mistake. You're onIy saying that because it's too late. We couId've Iearned something. - We have. Even if it's not very pIeasant. We've known each other two years. Does that count for nothing aII of a sudden? It wasn't alI of a sudden. We dragged things out artificialIy. We were mistaken. What are you going to do now? You mean without you? Excuse me. CouId l have a cigarette? HeIp yourseIf. Can l use your Iighter? - Sure. Are you a writer? Too IittIe imagination. I teach. Am I disturbing you? - No, you're not disturbing me. Then you're a teacher. - I work at the university. What do you teach? - History. I teach the history of daiIy Iife, of everyday things: how we eat, sleep, bury our dead, Iove. Sounds interesting. - It is. What do you do? I'm an actress. So you teach about Iove? Not directIy. I teach about the history of love, the behaviors associated with it and what they mean to us. Hasn't Iove always been the same experience, then or now? Our romantic ideal of Iove is an invention of the 1 8th century. But emotions like Iove, jeaIousy and so on have aIways existed. Perhaps, but they didn't have the same meaning, because other things took precedence. PeopIe were trying to survive. So the values of protection, security and soIidarity were more important. These days we have far greater possibiIities to express our feelings and to reaIize them. Things don't work out that way for me. As soon as l get together with someone, it goes wrong. Life is more compIicated now as we do have more possibiIities. EarIier, reIations were Iargely determined through work. Today we have both private and professionaI reIationships. You, too. You have to jump from one to the other and it's tough. Does that mean we have to choose between love and work? It means that there are reIationships that are primarily structured via work and others that are defined by emotions. It makes life more compIicated. It's so hard to talk about emotions. Whenever l try, it sounds sort of faIse, hackneyed. Like l'm just repeating myseIf. - It's no different for me. We're expected to aIways feeI the right thing, to be sincere. We're surrounded by expectations. So when we want to say something about ourselves, we're not sure if we're onIy just repeating something we've heard. There are gestures, Iooks. They have something real about them. That is perhaps the most direct form of expression we have. But we wouldn't Iive more authenticaIIy without Ianguage. It wouId impoverish our expressive potentiaI. If one views Iove not as a private emotion but as a means of communication, it might take one further. Everyone breaks up and finds a new partner. It's so random. ShouIdn't one Iove just one person forever? It's hard to foster Iove and make it last. And when it's over, it doesn't mean it never existed or can't exist again. It's a possibiIity. If a girI Iikes me straight off, it never works out. With me it's just the opposite. I wasn't initialIy attracted to the first boy l went out with. If he hadn't made an effort, nothing wouId've come of it. But it didn't Iast. - It lasted three years. EngIish subtitles: aIias FiIm & Sprachtransfer
