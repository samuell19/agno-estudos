Looks like you have your hands tied up. Oh, l live next door in room 505. Nice to meet you. Not much to unpack, huh? You don't seem like a student. l'm a taxi driver. Oh, l see. Have a cigarette? l just ran out. l can't believe they didn't match the wall papers. - Really? - They used cheap ones. This old fridge is from the barber shop. The owner said it's still usable. Usable? He only brought junk up here. l'll just take whatever l need. He's such a greedy bastard. He keeps renting out rooms even when this place will be rebuilt soon. Did most of the tenants move out? Yeah, most of them. Anyway, it's nice to have a new neighbor around. - Well, l'll see you later. - Okay, take care. A pack of cigarettes, please. Damn it, that pisses me off. Why are you so late? Some guy threw up in my car. Never pick up drunk idiots. Leave them to rot. l barely sleep and work my ass off. That's why l quit my last job as a substitute driver for bars. At least you got tips from those drunk bastards. l can't even fucking make this month's quota. Think life's that damn easy? lt's the same as that vomit. l better get to work. See you early in the morning! Bye, Kim-hyung! The same as vomit? -Are you seeing a girl from Seoul? -No, man. Then what did you come to Seoul for? l'm here cause l missed you, asshole. Then why do you have lipstick on your lips? Damn it! l told that bitch to wipe it off. Was she a whore? l'm not like you, asshole. Like your newjob? lt's better since l get to pick up people l like. You're such a weird bastard. Have you seen Mee-jung since then? Mee-jung? You think she'll show her face again? Did you forget how much she stole from us? You still can't get her out of your mind? Dumb ass. Look at those chicks... l wonder what they're like. Nice. Look at her hair. lt's a work of art. l'd do her. How long have you lived in Migum Apartments? Who's that guy? l said who is he, you bitch? Let go. Let go! You bitch! Come here! Let go of me, you son of a bitch! you son of a bitch! You filthy whore! l worked hard all night for a month to earn this. So what? Don't even dream about. You wanna gamble with this? You son of a bitch! Since you were careless, you lost our child. Now that there's nothing to care for, you fool around with other guys, you slut? Keep this in mind. l'm still your husband, bitch! Got it? You asshole... Give my money back! Give it back! What are you so scared of? lf you were me, you'd be scared too. ...if a dead person appeared in your dreams. lt's because that's all you think about. He really appears. l think Kwang-tae has something to tell me. Sun-young... ...l'm really frightened. What's so funny? -Are you gonna sleep with me or not? -Okay, okay. -l'm too scared to sleep alone. -You better. Are you headed home? Why the free tickets? Dose he work at a theater? He's a taxi driver. Have you met him before? Yesterday he... Nevermind. How old is he? How should l know?. l thought you guys talked before. l really don't know. -Hey. -What? -Hey! -What? Wanna see a movie tomorrow?. Okay. Why did it end like that? l knew it was going to be bad. l should've stayed home and slept. You're going to smoke here? - Do it outside. - All right. Hello. Were you in the theater? We could've came together. Would you like some tea? lt's on me. No thanks. Come on, let's go. Let's hurry. We're late. You're not leaving? Just one drink, okay? -l'm leaving. -Eun-soo... l have to give piano lessons. Hey! Are you all right? Do you want to go on a drive? l know a wonderful place. When l came last year, l swear they were here. This road is really pretty with falling leaves. All countryside roads are like this. lt's nice. How come you moved into room 504? Me? Why? Did you know that someone died in your room? Really? His name's Kwang-tae. Eun-soo's boyfriend l mentioned before. He recently died in a fire in room 504. So that's why the ceiling was like that when l moved in. Ever since then, Eun-soo's been strange. She quit her school too. l feel sorry for her. Don't you regret moving in that place? What? l'm fine. lt's close to work. Aren't you scared? No, what's there to be scared about. l heard many TV series were shot here. You must've been here a lot. Once in a while. When you have a girlfriend? Hey, do you want to see something fun? Come here. Can you raise that stick? Slightly back. - Like this? - Yeah. Okay, good. What are you doing? You don't know Bruce Lee? Who? You know, that famous martial arts guy. l'll do it again so.... Wait, don't move. Your shoestrings are untied. Stick your foot out more. -See you later. -Bye. What's all the noise? Whati??s a delivery boy doing in a tunnel? Look at the crazy bastard. What a prick! -Hey driver! Run him over! -Are you serious? l'll take full responsibility. Step on it! Keep stepping on it! Get closer to him! Because of idiots like him our country ended up this way. That son of a bitch... Huh? -Looks like an accident. -Where? Hey, isn't that the delivery boy? That's too bad... That prick had his funi??. Now he's paying for it! l feel much better! l'm glad he's dead! Serves him right! Watch where you're going? We'll flip over too. What's wrong? What's wrong? Calm down. Please calm down! lt's okay. Calm down. Everything's okay. l didn't do anything wrong. l didn't... He got drunk. He drank a lot and fell down. That son of a bitch almost beat me to death. l swear l didn't kill him. He did it to himself. l didn't do anything wrong. lt's not my fault... He did this to himself... l didn't kill him. -Are you on your way home? -Yes. Wanna grab a bite to eat first? Get in. Drink it. Looks delicious. Can we just help ourselves? Yeah, go ahead. Try some. They look tasty. Wow, it's really hot. These dumplings are dangerous. Give it a try and find out. Then why didn't you just leave him? You don't have kids anyway. l was afraid of living on my own. Don't you have a family? My mom died when l was young so l lived with my father. You see, my father wasn't normal. He left the house one day and never came back. Was he missing? l never saw his face after that day. l guess l'm going crazy like my father. l heard mental illness is hereditary. -Anywayi?? What should we do now?. -Do what? We committed a crime. Crime? What crime? lf we tell the police, it'll just be a headache. Your body is bruised all over. Anyway, we even held a funeral for a bastard who killed himself. Wasn't it a good deed? They were all foolish things greedy people did to each other. Their endless greed brought on a curse... Room 504, and a corpse... Now for the last chapter... ...chasing after girls' asses. Take it easy. Of course, you're tired. You touched girls' asses all night so how'd you expect not to be. l never did such a thing. l only sang a few songs and left. They dragged me to that bar so l had a couple of beers. Do you need a witness? You think it's easy to keep secrets around here? l can't believe this. You're old enough to have a grandson. Shame on you! l wish l had something to be ashamed of! Did you go out last night? You never bring me to those places. l'm the one that needs to go. Just wait till l sign that publishing contract. Not again... You're all talk... -Want it shorter? -Yeah, a little. She's a real beauty. -What are you talking about? -That man's wife. She sure was. What about the woman next door? She was nothing compared to his wife. Then why did he do it? What's so bad about her? That's why he was crazy. He killed his wife, ran off with the woman next door, and left his son in the fire. But he didn't burn his place. l heard the stove caused the fire. lt happened because he left his son alone. l heard a baby crying in that apartment for a few days. So l thought it was strange. To think of it nowadays, that fire was a blessing. - Why? - Think if there wasn't a fire. The baby would've starved to death if he was alone. After we saved the baby from the fire, part of his back was scorched. He would've died if we came any later. l can't forget how horrible it was. That bastard was out of his mind! lf you were him, where would you bury her? Sorry? That woman's corpse. ln the ceiling?, ln the hallway? ln the back mountain?, The wall? l need a shocking twist for my novel to live. -Do you know her? -No. She's strange. l think she got weirder after she lost her child. l feel frightened when l run into her in the hall sometimes. Just like in a horror novel. Mr. Kim, how about a drink? Sure, why not. -ln my room? -Okay. You've got a lot of books. After l lost my publishing firm, all l have now are these books. -You ran a publishing company? -Yeah, years ago. -Anyhow, how old are you Mr. Kim? -l'm thirty. - Born in 1972? - Yeah, in 1972. You seem to live alone. When l lost everything, my wife asked for a divorce. l lived alone ever since, but l feel more comfortable now. l miss my kids now and then. Let's see. l think it was summer when Kwang-tae moved in. He wanted to be a writer, but he had no talent. He said he moved here because this place inspired him to write. But it was strange. When l went into his place during the fire, there were flames only around his body in the center of the room. How could that happen? Even if you tried to, it's nearly impossible. What's wrong? Are you upset over what l said? No, l was just thinking. Anyway, all the bad things that happened in this building comes from a curse brought down by the ghost of that baby's mother. That's what my novel's about. lt's going to be great. -What could it be? -What is? l wonder what the ghost craves for. l don't know. Curious, huh? How are you going to write it? Buy the book when it's published. You know why? Because room 504 is the center stage of my novel. Like Mr. Song said, the murder that occurred thirty years ago happened in your room. lsn't it ironic? A place that was a murder scene before is now a normal apartment. Jin-soo! What are you doing there? The pigeon flew away. - Come in and eat. - Where's my little Jin-soo? Let's eat. -Bye, teacher! -See you next time. Okay! -When did you come in? -l was just... Here for a haircut? No, l just came to give you my rent. lt's rent day already? ''Mommy's bad'' Shit! Those losers are presidents now, and now they order me around. Just wait! When this novel comes out, l'll be right back at the top. And l'll raised my kids myself. lt'll all work out! Today we'll have a drink at my place, but it's all on me after my book comes out! Don't worry about it. -You were big help. -What help? You're the only witness of that tragedy thirty years ago. You're 'Mr. Kim the barber.' Why is my last name Kim? lt's Song! All the characters in my novel are cursed. So how can l use their real names? Am l cursed, too? l told you that 'Mr. Kim the barber' lives till the end. What's going on? This building is a dump! Come on, you scared me. l almost had a heart attack. l thought you said her ghost is wandering around this building. lt's just a novel. ''Mommy'' ''Mommy'' -Who is it? -lt's me, Mr. Kim! Did l wake you? Can you give me a ride to the publisher? l'm late for an important appointment. lt'll take too long if l walk down for a taxi. l'll pay for the ride, okay? Ghosts don't exist. Come on. You know how many types of ghosts there are? Some ghosts think they're still alive. While others live in people's bodies. l'm not joking. lt's true. By the way... Where's your hometown? -What? My hometown? -Yeah. Well... l guess l was born somewhere. What does that mean? l'm an orphan. -Orphan? -Yes. l see... An orphan... l met Mee-jung's parents, and they said she always kept in touch. But she suddenly stop calling. lsn't it strange? What do you think? What's with you, detective? lsn't that why you're investigating? What are you asking me for? Come on... -lt's bullshit... -What? You got a problem? lt's not an easy job. lf someone files a report, what do you expect? Before she disappeared, heard you both lived together. Why did you switch jobs? l didn't switch. l got fired. Anyway, do know what kind of girl Mee-jung is? She borrowed money from her friends at my work, and disappeared after she told them l'd pay it off. They didn't buy my story and canned me. l'm a victim, too. Victim? Yeah! Victim... -You need to be neater. -Just leave it alone. You should throw away useless stuff. Can you hand me the water? Come here. lt looks good on you. What's this for? lt looked nice so l bought it. lt'll get cold soon. So do you like it? What? Yeah... Why didn't you tell me? What? l heard you lost your child. The guy next door told me. After l heard that, it made me curious about something. About what? My parents. Did they abandon me? Or was l lost like your child? You see, l'm an orphan. - Why did you get off? - Take it easy. Okay, okay... - Once more. - Go slower. Wow, it's fun! Did it already take it? What is this? lt came out weird. -One more time. -Wait -where do l have to look? -Up there. Don't move. Got it! Yeah! Room 504! Damn it. -l'll get off here. -Bye. l'll see you soon then. What are you doing? Aren't these Kwang-tae's notes? l took it when his place was on fire... Weren't you the first one to go in? That's right. But you grabbed this first before saving a life? l threw it out while putting out the fire. You probably didn't want it, and l felt like it was mine so... How is this yours? lt's Kwang-tae's novel. Novel? lt's not a novel, it's scribble. lf it's a novel, then it's my novel. What do you mean by that? Kwang-tae met a pro like me so he learned a lot from me. l gave him a lot of ideas. And he used a lot of them. Then why are you burning this? Whenever l look at his notes, l think of Kwang-tae too. l guess that's why l'm burning this. Why are you looking at me that way? He took Kwang-tae's notes first, He's copying exactly what's in them. How could he just leave him like that? You call that a writer? l think Mr. Lee had something to do with the fire. Mr. Lee? Yeah! He pretended to help Kwang-tae, but he was just using him. lt's unlikely. l'm going to bed. -Sun-young! -Bye. l bet you can't be that way to him. Eun-soo! There's something strange about him. You think he's not a problem? Then why are the police looking for him? What do know about him? You don't love him at all. Why are you hanging around him? To get rid of your husband? ls that why you need him? Eun-soo! Didn't you always say you wanted to kill your husband? Since he looks stupid and naive, you're trying to use him, right? Why do you live this way? l thought you were sick of living like this! -You think you'll be happy with him? -What about you? Were you happy with loving Kwang-tae? Love? l don't need such a thing. l don't care if he's stupid, an orphan, or some gangster. As long as l'm comfortable l don't care who he is. What does it matter if l love him or not? l'm gonna live how l want from now on. How come it's hard to see your face lately? Are you sick? Not really... -l'm off tomorrow. -So? Wanna go somewhere for some fresh air? And eat some good food. Yeah? There's something about this apartment. lt's like a woman. -A woman? -Yeah. l hear a lullaby sung to a little baby. Like it's trying to tell me something. -But l keep losing contact. -My baby, go to sleep... You're crazy about him. lsn't he cute, though? lt's ugly. What's so cute about it? You don't know him. You know how great he is? He seemed lonely so l got another one. But he killed it with no mercy. You're so cute. He manages to survive even if l leave him alone for a week. lsn't he great? Anyway, it's ugly. -A baby... -Baby? l'm positive her voice said 'the baby is coming.' The baby is coming? You're not coming? Let's go. Eun-soo. l have to get out of this apartment. When l heard that the baby is coming... l kept thinking about it, but it's strange. What is? lf the ghost of that baby's mother is in my apartment, maybe she wants me to leave. ...since her son is coming back. Kwang-tae, are you sick of me? What about the baby in my stomach? Ghosts don't exist. lf you're sick of me, then be honest. And don't give ridiculous excuses. lt's not that. ln any case, it's strange. lf l stay, something bad might happen to me. Something strange is going on in this building. lsn't this where you tied my shoestrings last time? You remember something like that? l remember that the most. How come? When l saw you tie my shoestrings... l wondered if my mother would be that kind. You know what l mean. Your mother? So how did you lose your child? My son, Young-joon? l lost him. l lost him... l lost him... Have some. lt's been a long time, huh? l was busy since then. -ls business doing well? -Not too good. -Let me know if you need anything else. -Okay. Are you trying to make me stay longer? Just forget about work today. One day won't get you fired. Drink! Have another. Stepping forward over the corpses of our fellow soldiers Good-bye Nakdong River We're advancing forward After we defeat the enemy we hate... When the stars appear We smile together When the stars disappear We cry together With that breakable promise Spring is passing on l must be born with a terrible fate. Fate? l don't believe in fate. l don't think l became an orphan because of my fate. lt's my parents' fault for throwing me away. Am l right? Fate... l don't believe in it. lt doesn't exist. Did you know?. You remember when we met on the rooftop after you moved in? The day when your eyes were like this? Did you know that l was going to jump that night? Would l have died if you hadn't showed up? ls that coincidence or fate? ls that all you can think about? Anyway, you're still alive now. You never have any worries. Wanna know how to live without worries? How?. There was this great fighter in my high school. Even though l was a good fighter too, l couldn't beat him. He was also a good student, and came from a good family. -l couldn't compare to him. -Of course not. But one day he started making fun of me being an orphan. lt drove me insane. Since l couldn't beat him in anything, l went crazier than hating to go to school. l even wanted to die. l couldn't bear it anymore so l met him behind school one day. And with a knife l brought.... So after l killed that bastard and buried him in the mountain, l felt like living again. Nobody knows about till this day. You're the first to hear this. Anyhow, this is how l live without worries. By the way... Do you love me? You know l'm not a normal man. - l'm just an orphan... - Why's that important? By the way, do you love me? Love? Well, it's confusing. Confusing? What's confusing? l don't know what's confusing. l've never felt like this in my whole life. But when l see you, l'm confused. Confused... What could it be? What makes me confused? Huh? l hope this fits you. -What is it? -lt's a present. Put it on. That candy bar... lt was Young-joon's favorite. Young-joon? My son... My son... l think l should go to work. Do you want to go with me? Why did you take the ring out of my refrigerator? So are you going to come? You planned all this from the start, didn't you? Did you need me to kill your husband? l overheard everything you said to Eun-soo. l guess you needed anyone... So was it me? Then what's next? After you use me up dry, will you run away? Or are you going to use another guy? Are you writing some cheap romance novel? You should listen carefully whenever you eavesdrop. When l needed someone, you were there. How did l use you? Tell me how. Am l just anyone to you? So it means you looked down on me. Am l right? That's what it is, right? Do you know what that ring means to me? Once l gave it to a girl like you. You know that l'm poor. But l gave her everything from clothes to jewelry. But in the end, she was the same as you. She looked down on me and used me. But do you know what upsets me the most? The fact that l love you very much, and that you don't love me. Do you know what l mean? Hey! What's so funny? Since l was beaten so much this is nothing! Tell me what l did wrong first and then hit me. What love are you talking about? You think l'm yours since l slept with you? Don't be stupid! l'm sick of life. lf you wanna love someone, look somewhere else. Not me. You're sick of life? You killed your husband and lost your son. You call yourself a person? How dare you talk about my child like that! How dare you! How dare you talk about my baby, you asshole! Do you know me? You fucking asshole! Why? Why? You worried l'll make him an orphan like you? You fucking bitch! Who are you to toy with me? Do l look that stupid to you? You fucking bitch! Then why did you ask to see me? lt doesn't have the potential to sell? You bastards... What do you all know?. You don't appreciate my novel? Fine. You sons of bitches. We'll see, you assholes. Here it is! A fear you can't see! The best part of my novel! l'm petrified right now! Do you know, you sons of bitches? Now the ghost beckons her grown up son to be with him forever. She wants to live with her son again like thirty years ago. The man in room 504 who didn't know his fate until the last minute. He's her son! This a spectacular ending, you sons of bitches! Oh, Mr. Kim. Why am l a ghost's son? What gives you the right, you son of a bitch? Why? Why am l a ghost's son? ls it fun? ls it fun? This fucking apartment! She's coming! She's coming! She's on her way! She's calling her child! See, you bastards? My novel is real life! You son of a bitch! Fuck... Fucking apartment... My baby, go to sleep.... ln the front yard and in the back hill The birds and little lambs are sleeping The moon is sending Silver and golden balls To the window this night
