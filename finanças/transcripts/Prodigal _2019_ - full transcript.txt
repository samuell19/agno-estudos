Okay. Are you all going home? You all see your rides? Okay. Yeah. Bye kids. Hi. - What up, little man? - Hey, Mister, thank you for helping me today. - No problem, Miss E. - He was such a big help. - What's up, man? How was your day? - It was okay. - It was okay? Why was it just okay? - There's this bully. - Bully? What's his name? - Jonathan. - Jonathan, well you tell Jonathan, next time you see him that you got a big brother named Kilo. - Ah, Mr. Thompson! Glad I caught you. I've left several messages for your mother. She's not returned any of my calls. - She's a nurse. She gets busy. - Yeah, indeed. Then maybe you can pass on a matter of importance for me. You see our school has graciously granted Cayden here nearly a full scholarship leaving only a minuscule portion to be paid by his family. Well now that payment is now two months past due. And sadly, if it is not paid by week's end, we will have no choice but to disallow Cayden's attendance. - You know what, you'll get your paper, okay? - I'm sorry, paper? - You'll get your money, hear me? - Well. For Cayden's sake, I certainly hope so. Come on man, let's get out of here. - Mr. Thompson. Just one second, please. I overheard Rawlings. And I have some money saved up. I'd be so glad to help catch up Cayden's tuition. - Oh what you think this is, help the little handicap kid, huh? You think we need your money? You keep it, all right? We don't need it. - Kilo, don't be like that. - No, that's not what I'm offering. Cayden is brilliant. He's a 12 year old doing 12th grade work. I'd hate to see him miss any schooltime. - Well you know what, I tell you what, you're not his mom nor are you his sister. So you keep your money, we don't need it. We good. - Kilo! - Come on man, let's get outta here. Look. I apologize. That was rude. It's just this asshole pissed me off. - Rawlings? He pisses everybody off. - Look. We're good though, thank you. - Okay. Let's get out of here, man. - Hey Kilo, how we gonna pay for my surgery and my tuition? - Don't worry about all that, little man, all right? We got that covered, okay? Okay. - All right. - I know bro, I'm telling you man. Yo. So I'm sitting here, right? Christine fine ass.

Never really got no home since. - I love Kilo. He tries to act all hard on the outside but on the inside, he's a good young man. - Yeah. Can you tell me who any of these other young men are? - I only know them by their nicknames. This one is, - Oh, hello, Jack, Jim. - Don, actually. Can we help you? - Oh don't mind me, go right ahead. - Why are you here? - I need to know who Nate's friends are too. - Why? - My unit was surveilling that house when it was hit. - Well this is a multiple death homicide investigation so correct me if I'm wrong but that supercedes any narcotics investigation you might have going on. So... bye. - While you're consoling this woman be sure you thank her for raising a goddamn menace to society. - What's her angle? - Don't know. But I aim to find out. What up? - Shit, you Leroy?

He says that was Censear's house that got hit. - You talking about kingpin drug dealer Censear? - The very one. Word is, Nate wasn't by himself. Somebody was with him.

They don't know we was with him. - Yeah, sound like it, man. - I tell you what. Cayden's going on spring break next week. I think we just need to get out of town and lay low for a minute. Till this all blow over. - What you think about Syracuse? - Syracuse, I like that. I think we need to make that move. - Yeah bro. Hey I'ma get Dana to come with me. You want me to get her bring her friend? - Who? - That girl Chanel. - Oh hell no, you know I don't fuck with that girl, dog. No, brah.

That's true. - Yeah man. Hey look just drop me off at the crib, man so I can go pack. - You got it, dog. - Sorry to bother you. What's going on? - I got a lead for you but you didn't hear it from me. - I've paid you enough money to retire. So give me what you got. - So I accessed the cell tower records near the drug house. Two of Nate's friends has cells pinging off the same tower as Nate's. - Which ones? - Jeffrey Jones, goes by the name Junebug. And Keith Thompson, they call him Kilo. - Kilo? Kilo? Ain't that Ebony's boy? - Hell yeah man, I'm pretty sure it is, bro. - Now I'm not saying they were with Nate but at least it's a lead. - All right. I want you to put a couple men on him. 24-7. Get me back my shit, all right? Good work. Miles. - Hey. I'm sorry, I got tied up with some stuff. - No problem, no problem. I'm fine. - What's up man, you good? - What's up? - Hey.

New York City? - Oh, no, like upstate, Syracuse area. - Really? - Yeah. - My half sister lives up there. - Really? - That's a coincidence. - I was actually supposed to go there for spring break but I'm closing on a house soon. - Oh wow. You're buying a house. - Yeah, my mom's a real estate agent so I got a really good deal. I can't pass it up, so, yeah. - Got you. - Yeah, that's good, but, if it doesn't take so much time I might still make the trip. Well, we'll have to see. - You definitely should. Syracuse is like more laid back, you know. - She was telling me. So maybe I will. - You got a pen, missy? - What you need a pen for? - Cayden, what are you up to? - That's Kilo's cell number. - What'd I tell you about that? - Have a great vacation. Take many many pictures of the museums you see and visit for me please. - Will do. - Okay, all right. I'll see y'all later. - See you later. Come on man, let's get you out of here. - You like her, don't you? - All right, little man. We are home. Hey mommy. - Hey baby. - Hey mama. - How you doing? - Ready to eat? - Yes, I'm starving. - Let's go wash them hands. Hey mama. - Hey baby. How was your day? - It was okay. - What's wrong? - Ah, nothing. - Kilo, what's wrong with you? Baby, what is going on? - Nate. Nate got killed last night, mama. - No. What happened? - They say he was trying to rob a dope house. - Oh my god. Oh. I know his mother is in shock. - Mama, they said me and June tried to rob that house with him. But I swear we didn't, I swear. Look, me and June just gonna go upstate for a little while and just lay low. - Did you rob that house, boy? - Momma. What up? - Hey Lo. You need to get up outta there, bro. Censear got some men in front of my crib and he probably had two at yours too. - Aight, aight, aight, I'm on it, I'm on it. - Don't come to my crib, bro. Call me when you're a few blocks away. Yeah, just meet me at the park, man. What about, about a Park bro. Yeah, I'll be there in five. - Okay I'm on my way. Mom I gotta go. - Kilo! Kilo! - Going somewhere? - The hell you want, man? - Censear wanna talk to you. Now shut up and keep walking. - Censear ain't got shit to say to me! The hell wrong with you? - I think we need a cigarette break. - I don't smoke. But I could use a cup of coffee. - I think I know why Forester wanted to know who Nate's friends are. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I think Forester and her boys wanted to skim money off the top of that dope. - Doesn't that surprise me. - They've purchased luxury houses, cars, boats all up in the last two years. - So why does she wanna know who Nate's friends are? - The robbers got away with at least 300K. I think Forester and her men want to count on that money. I'll see if I can pull some hard evidence before I take it to Internal Affairs. - Those are serious allegations, Jack.

You all business, you wanna go right to the point. All right, let me stop playing, listen. I need to, this serious, all right? I need to talk to you about your son Kilo. What about? - Your son came up to my house and robbed me the other day, him and that little Junebug cat he was with. - I already asked him about that. He say he wasn't there. - That's not true. I got a reliable source that said it was him and that kid who got killed. Nate? - Yeah, Nate. Now I know him, Kilo, Junebug. I know they tight as two peas in a pod, know what I'm saying? And I know that's your son and I ain't gonna hurt him but you gotta understand something this shit is serious. - I told you he didn't do it. - I don't give a fuck what you told me. Now you better listen to me. You better listen real careful. Because I'm not fucking around. You got that? Yeah. - Now. Now listen I need him to bring me back all of my money and all my works, you understand? I ain't gonna hurt him, I'm gonna give him a pass. But I want all my shit. You need to talk to him. All right? I will. - And you know I miss you. I miss what we had back in the day. - I got kids to think about and your street life is just too dangerous. I'll tell Kilo what you said. - All right. - I love how these fools who get shot in the movies and just die. It's hard, bro. It don't happen like that. - It's mama. - Just take it. - Hey mama. - Were you with Nate? And don't lie to me. - Was I with Nate? What you mean was I with Nate? - You were, weren't you? - Mama, no I wasn't with Nate. - I spoke with Censear and he knows it was you and Junebug. - Censear, how do you know him? - I knew him a lifetime ago when he was young like you. We had a thing once. And if it wasn't for that, you might be dead. - Okay, well what did he want? - He wants his money and his dope back, no questions asked. - Whoah. Mama, we ain't got his dope. - Kilo, he promised he won't hurt you as long as you bring it back. He's giving you a few days. - I tell you what. Let's just not even talk about this over the phone. We'll be home tomorrow, we'll talk about it then, okay? All right, love you too. Dammit! - How'd he know? Hey when the store open at eight, we grab some throwaways over there. - I'm trying to figure out why the fuck does Censear think we have his dope? We didn't take that nigga's shit. - The drug was on Nate, bruh. - You know what, I seen them crooked ass cops standing over Nate's body when we took off running. I guarantee you them niggers got it, brah. - I feel you bro, what the fuck we 'posed to do? Hey look bro, you going to holler at your pop, fool. You're gonna tell him what's up. - Nah, fuck all that, dog. Man fuck he ain't got shit to do with none of this, bro. - I feel you bro. - He probably just as dirty as the rest of them. Fuck that, bro. I ain't got shit to say to that nigger, bro. - Look, I feel you bro. I don't want you and me end up like Nate. You feel me? - I feel you. That's what I'm saying. - Let's get the fuck out of here. Hell yeah. So what did you get on your test yesterday? - Well, I got a 87. - An 87? I thought you would get an A. - Well, some of the stuff I didn't know. - Okay, okay. - I'll get it. - I feel like if I took it again, I'll get a A. - Well did they let you take a retest? - I'm not sure but I don't think she will. - Well, you can ask. You're not afraid to ask, are you? - Hey, slugger. - Hey daddy. - I have a fishing trip lined up this summer. You can come and stay. - Sweet, where? - Florida Keys. I don't suppose you'll come? - Well, I'll think about it. - Cool. Can I talk to you up front for a second? I'm pretty sure Kilo was with Nate when he was killed. I need you to tell him to talk to me. Some really bad people after him. - Who? - This guy named Censear. He's a big drug dealer. It was his house that was hit. But it gets worse. - What do you mean? - There's a crew of crooked cops looking for Kilo also. I'ma do what I can to stop them. But Kilo needs to lay low and keep his ass out of trouble. - Jack, please don't let them hurt him. - Hey Lo man, you know we gotta get the fuck up outta here, man. Like we can't. That Censear, man, he ain't play no goddamn game. - Man, fuck him! - Man, I know bro. We gotta get the fuck up outta here. - Kilo, there are too many coincidences. Now you didn't come home the night that Nate was killed. - What, mama, what? - Don't mama me! Now why would you do something so stupid as to rob a dope house? - Look, mama, I'm not saying we did it, okay? But you know, drug dealers is like cockroaches. A dealer killed JD and her sister in her house for selling blunts, mama. I hate dealers! - So you did do it. - Look, we just took the money. We didn't take the dope. Them crooked ass cops took the dope. - So Jack was right. - What? What he got to do with this? - Your dad said there's a crew of crooked narcotic cops that's looking for you and Junebug and they want that money. - So what his punk ass gonna do, huh? Is he as useless as a cop as he is a father 'cause he ain't never been there for me. - He's trying. Do you still have the money? - Yeah, yeah we still got the money. - Good. I'll go call Censear, tell him what happened and make him understand. But you're gonna have to give that money back. All of it. - Okay, okay, we'll give the money back. - I'm gonna go call your daddy, tell him he's right about those cops. Then I'll go see Censear. We all gonna have to get out of here and lay low. - I hear you, I hear you. See your mama's saying some real shit, 'cous, that's what I'm talking about. She's saying that shit, that's what I'm saying. - I don't want Jack in my business. He ain't never been there for me, dog. - I know that, cous! - You wouldn't know nothing about that! - Man, fuck that nigger, man! - I can't tell you how I know. Just take my word for it, Jack. Them cops took those drugs. No, they weren't there. But they know somebody who was and according to them Nate had the drugs on him when they killed him. Mhmm. Please do. Please don't. Don't let them kill our son. Okay, okay. Bye. - Word on the street is that Forester and her boys are skimming more than money. They're stealing dope too. - Who told you that? - Ebony. She says everyone in the neighborhood knows. Whoever was with Nate is telling people that Nate tried to steal the dope. That's how he got shot. - Damn. That's why the coroner found traces of coke on the body. - Yeah. Now it all makes sense. Look, I got a meeting with Assistant Chief O'Grady in 10 minutes. And then Internal Affairs in the morning. - Okay. Jack. Be careful. - I will. - June! Come on, dog. June, hey! - No, hit the bags! What? - Dog, you aight? Yo man, you ain't in war no more dog, calm down, ain't nobody after you. Just relax. Hey, girl. - Hey you. Can I see you today? - I can't come over tonight, I got some family business I gotta handle tonight, so. - It isn't Cayden, is it? - Oh nah, nah, nah, it's not Cayden. Cayden's cool. You know, he loves you like a big sister. - I feel the same exact way about him. But I do think he misses you bringing him to school. He's been a little down. - Yeah, I miss him too. I'm hoping things get right soon though. - Yeah. - So I'ma see you tomorrow, right? Okay. - All right, bye. It's Catherine, dog. - Little girl got you real, bro. - Hey man. Looks like we all out of gin, man. I'ma run down to the liquor store and grab us some more, right? - Right dog. Grab some condoms. He doesn't have your drugs. Even my ex husband thinks those cops took it. - Really? What about my money? - Said he'd bring it back if you promise not to hurt him. - So you're telling me them punk ass cops took my dope? Ain't that some shit. All right. You tell your son I say he's real lucky. Because me and you go way back. And you know how I feel about you. So you tell him I want my paper. All of it. He got 48 hours. You understand? - Thank you, Censear. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Now let yourself out, all right? - Looks like we've got a very serious problem. - Yes sir, I'd say we do. - Disturbing to say the least. Let me get on this. I'll notify Chief Wilson in the morning. And I'll go with you to your hearing with Internal Affairs. - Thanks, Chief. - Good work, Detective. - Appreciate it. - Damn! There's a problem. Now you need to handle it. When, tonight! - Yeah? I'm chilling, man, asleep. Yeah, what club? Yeah man, yeah yeah. Hey dude come pick me up, I'm at the crib, man. All right.

I thought that was more important. Listen, I'm gonna let you know your son was involved. - Kilo? - Yeah, apparently he and another guy took him out. Self-defense from what we've gathered. - Damn! - I know. One other thing. They found two unarmed men not too far from here gunned down. More of Nate's friends. Which ones? - Thomas Jefferies and Will Denkins. - That's Chubbs and Big T, shit! - Yeah, look. I don't have any proof but I feel like Forester and her men probably executed them. So try to get in touch with your son. Have him come in so we can protect him, all right? - I'll try, Don, man, I'll try. Thanks man, thanks. Shit! In the morning Internal Affairs will take down Forester. But tonight, Kilo needs to lay low. Forester and his men will kill him! - Let me call him, okay? Ebony.

Hey, baby, honestly, honestly, my life is a mess right now and, it'll just be better if I didn't just drag you into it. - Obviously you don't know how much I care about you. Don't push me away, maybe I can help. - I know, but you got so much. You got so much ahead of you to look forward to. I wouldn't do nothing but mess that up. I think it'll just be best if you just moved on. - Come over. I have something to tell you but only in person. After, if you still want to break up then I won't try to stop you. - She want me to come over, June. - I don't see why not, dog. Don't nobody know about her. Look, I'll just drop you off, man. Run back to my spot and get some more hardware. You feel me? - Hello? Hey, yeah. I'll come over. - Okay. - These motherfuckers gonna pay. I got something, I got something, all right? All right man. I missed you so much. - I miss you too, baby. So what did you wanna tell me? You okay? - Okay, so. Last week, a couple of days after I got back from New York I noticed that my cycle was late and I didn't think anything of it until the next week and it didn't come. So I took a test. And it's positive. I'm pregnant with your child. You playing with me? - No, I would not joke about something like this. - Wow. Come here. Are you serious? Are we really gonna have a baby? - But listen to me. If you're gonna be the father of our child, you have to get out of this street life or whatever it is that you're involved in. I'm serious. You have to. - Listen. I love you. I do, but it's just, it's not that easy. - I can help you. My father's a police officer, he can help you too. - What, your father's a cop? - Yes, but he adores me. And if I ask him to, he will help you. I know this has been your life but if you really want to get out, that is your choice to make. Because I'm gonna have this child. And I'm not about to bring him or her into a dangerous situation before they're even born. And we need you. Please. Please think about it. Okay? - Yeah, I'll think about it. - Yeah hold on, hold on, hold on. - What was that? - GPS tracker. That punk ass cop shot our homeboy, man. And I bet you it's cause they ain't give us up. - Ain't that bout a bitch? If they gonna mess with you, they gotta go through me. I appreciate that, Tank. Hey man, how you been though, brah? - I can't complain. Who would listen? - I feel you, man. Hey man, we gotta go back to my crib, bro. They'll be packing some heavy heat, so they'll get my good shit. - All right. - Hey. Hey Ma. - Oh my god, Kilo, where are you? I'm at my girlfriends' house. - Girl? What girl? - Catherine. Catherine McCallister. She's Cayden's teacher. - I know who she is, but, your father is her dad's partner. Kilo! Kilo! We got you now, bitch! Get up, bitch! - Kilo! Censear want you alive, whatever. - Greg, it's Don. Jack's been murdered. And I know who did it. I need you and Internal Affairs to respond with CSI and the Chief. Heck, bring goddamn everyone! - So you the young nigger that ran up in my house. Disturb my operation. Think there ain't gonna be no consequences? - I'm sorry Mr. Censear, I just-- - Pull him up. Don't talk. All right, you just listen. - All right, this is an aerial view of the house. I want team one in the back, one man each corner. Team two, west side, team three east. Team four, I want them to break down that fucking door. Hodges, sniper position. - Got you. - Roll out. It's time to fucking end this. Load them up. - Yeah, look around, nigger. You don't tell me what I need, you ain't gonna leave here alive, you understand? Now I'ma ask you one last time, where your partner Junebug at? - Leave him alone, you see he's hurt! You see he's hurt! - Shut the fuck up, you raggedy bitch! Pull him up. - That's all you got? - I'm through playing with you, boy. Now tell me where Junebug is or I'ma kill her. - I don't know where Junebug is. He was supposed to pick us up, but these clowns got us first. - Kill this bitch. - You kill her, you're gonna have to kill me. You obviously don't know who my homeboy is. Ex Special Forces. And he already put 80 of you chumps in the ground. So go ahead. Go ahead, kill me. Kill me! My mom said you like to beat on women 'cause you're too scared of a real man, is that true? You so tough, prove it. Shoot me. Shoot me! Motherfucker, shoot me! Shut the fuck up though! Pull it! Pull it, motherfucker, go ahead! - You want your eyes open or closed? Punk ass motherfucker! Keep talking, nigger. - Go ahead, pull it! - Censear, don't! Oh no! Censear. Kilo is your son! - My son, what the fuck you talking about, Ebony? That nigga ain't my son. - Yes he is, that's why I left you so he wouldn't be like you. Yo, Censear. Man, a nigger just ran across the yard. Forester, I've got two in sight. I just saw him. Over there, I just saw him. Both targets down. - Drop your weapons. Drop it! - Down. Down. - Yo, nigga, what the fuck? Get down! - What the fuck is going on? - You treat me like a fucking kid, all this time, you didn't think I was gonna let you get away with that, did you? - I tell you something, nigga. You're a fucking dead man walking. - Anything in this house worth taking? - They got a meth lab. Only he ain't started cooking yet. And this is everybody except Junebug? - Motherfucker say he can't find Junebug. - I heard y'all punk ass were looking for me. Well I'm right here. And y'all might as well lower them goddamn weapons 'cause if I drop this bitch right here, it's gonna be a fucked up day for everybody up in here. You feel me? Hey Miss T, go ahead and take Kilo and Catherine up out of here. - Okay come on. June, can I take Censear? I owe him that. - Go on ahead. - The minute you walk out that door, my sniper will kill you all. - You mean that house nigga you put in the field? - Guess we took care of that. Hey, y'all take the front. The back kind of toasty. Blast her. T, let's get up out of here, bro. - Go right ahead, we'll hunt you down like rats. There's more of us downstairs. - If you follow us, we'll kill your ass. - Son of a bitch. I thought you said that grenade was a dud. - It was, but not the second one. Baby, what you doing here? - Is that a question? You go to war, we go to war. - That's what's up.
