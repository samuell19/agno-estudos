DARK RIVER We are please to recognize the government of Misiones, the National Police Force, all the people of OBERA and S.I.C.A. for their support of the production of this film. Directed by HUGO DEL CARRIL The Alto Parana, one of Argentina's richest territories, a fecund and productive land. Yerba mate, the green gold has been a source of fabulous riches and the river a path of civilization and progress. But this has not always been the case. Just a few years ago these were accursed lands of punishment. The river flowed dark with blood. The Parana held in its ample bosom the awful cargo vomited out by the Green Hell. Downstream, many corpses floated. Faceless, nameless corpses without families. In the beginning, the curious would gather but the shock soon wore off. The spectacle was too familiar and it was too difficult to identify the dead. One day they would see a boat full of mensus leaving. Sometime later, the Green Hell would send back a macabre procession. A corpse floating, then another, then another... their clothing and their skin in shreds. Floating calmly, they came to rest on Pedregosa Beach at the foot of the hill. The washerwomen who came down to the river found the men quiet and alone next to the rocks. So they crossed themselves and fled, talking quickly in a trembling, frightened guarani. And there they stayed, the ones who came back. But there were always those who were leaving, Brazilians, Paraguayans, and peasants from our coast, brought by the lure of easy money. Insatiable greed continued demanding human tribute. Cabrera Marquez! Sign me up, boss. Please. I already said no! You're too old to go north. There's the Turk again, gathering cattle for the Alto Parana. They have no idea what they're getting into. Sign here. Rufino Peralta! Sign here. Well friends, let's celebrate! You'll have a wonderful life. One long bender! You work a few months, come back with full wallets and then, you drink and have fun, my friends! On top of that, you'll have all the women you like! To our friend the Turk! To the Alto Parana! You'll thank me for this. I've helped thousands of workers. You've helped me too! Me too! Remember? This is what I brought back from Alto Parana. Drunk idiot. Ingrate! They won't fool me again! No way I'm going back to Alto Parana! I have dough, see? For you and all the women. Will you stay with me tonight? Cheers, beauty! Flor de Lis just for me! Just for me! An empty boast, flea-bitten mensu! You have no money to pay me. I'll give you all the money you want. Look. How much do you want? - Tell me. - Two hundred. Flor de Lis for just one man? No! Flor de Lis for everyone! Dough! We'll split the bill, buddy! But she's for everyone! Here you go. You're not showing much for 400. Take your clothes off. Don't make me beg! It will be rough up North. Many never come back. Why don't you stay here with me? I already told you. I can talk to the Turk if you want. And give back what he gave you. Here you'll want for nothing. I earn lots of money. I don't like your job. Me neither. But one has to live. When does the boat leave? At six. You're going to Puerta Allica, right? And if I went there someday, to see you? Rufino! I am a poor mensu... Eliseo Rubianez? Santos Peralta? A nice harvest... Rubino Peralta! - How many men? - Eighty-five. You again? Sign me up, boss. My son is there. Ok, get onboard. Stop that! Add her under Aguilera. - What's your name? - Flora Medina. - How much for each guy? - Three hundred. - That's a good business. - Yeah, good business. Jacinto Sosa! I never signed! My recollection brings old memories. A spirit comes that is a cry of anguish. My sick heart thinks tenderly of you and of beautiful nights in Paraguay. An uncertain orphan, I follow the path the tragedy of my deep pain but nothing happens; my soul in mourning, I dream of nights in Paraguay. Far from you, I became a bohemian, I sing my verses at random. I suffer, singing late into the night, which is not the night of Paraguay. I think of my beloved mother, my home, the lover who perhaps forgot me. I constantly glimpse lovely reflections of the moon I cannot see. The beautiful moon does not reflect me, the cold fog covers my steps. These are not your songs, much less your light, radiant moon of Paraguay. There! There! The ones who come back. You'll lead a...funny life, friends. I'm telling you. - Get on the carts! - Let's go! What's going on? My trunk fell off the cart. And you make me stop the carts so you can gather up your trash? Get back in your place! I'll get it together fast, boss. Get back in your place or I'll break your back! Let's go! Hurry up, we have to reach the plantation by tomorrow afternoon. He's an animal... Come down from the carts. You have four hours to rest. Aren't you going to sleep? How am I supposed to sleep? With what we've been seeing? Get moving! In a line. Let's go! Get started! Throw down all your weapons here. Don't give them the gun. Okay. - Move along to the office! - Let's go. Celodonio Campos: Finder's fee, 300. Travel, 70. Clothing, 85. Expenses in the bar, 52. Advance pay, 150. You owe 857. Santos and Rufino Peralta. Finder's fee 500 for each of you. Travel, 70. Clothing 124 and 102. Advance pay 150 each. Expenses in the bar, 285. You owe 987 and 974. - That's not right, boss. - What? My brother and I only owe 600 pesos. That's what we received. That's what the broker said in Posadas. What do I care what the broker said? What matters is what it says here. That's what the boss paid for you and that's what you have to earn back. This is an abuse of power! I'll show you abuse! Luciano Agramonte. German Acuna. Keep your eyes on the Peraltas. I think... They're going to give us quite a time. Look at that, buddy. More cattle for the field. I can't go on. Come give me a hand. Damn, you're beautiful. Give me that, you're coming with me. I'll help her, boss. Fine, but come straight back to your quarters! If you slack off you'll taste my whip. Thanks. - Humberto Villega! - Six bundles. - Silvano Sosa! - Seven and a half bundles. What? Come on, let's go. Every day it's the same. Unless you bring only leaves, they dock you by half. If they cheat me, all hell will break loose. - Evaristo Vargas! - Eight bundles. What do you mean eight! It's nine! - Shut up! - Why would I shut up? I'm not indentured and I don't let anyone rob me. What's going on here? What's your problem? I cut nine bundles and they're only paying for eight. - The yerba was poorly cut. - Eight bundles. There are nine bundles! Nine! Nine bundles! Nine bundles! Nine bundles! Why are we just standing here? What's wrong with you all? The first one of you who defies me will get ten lashes. In four or five days he'll be fine. But tonight he'll have a nasty fever. If only I could have cared for my son like this. Have you seen him? He died. About a year ago. They beat him like this poor fellow. But on the mountain. They just left him lying there. Like an animal. It's brutal how they beat that poor guy. How long are we going to take this? They're killing us with work and beatings This is like being in hell. My son didn't make it out alive. How did you find out about your son? They told me long ago, in Posadas. So why did you come here? To be closer to him. And because now all the mensus... are my sons. I know what I'm talking about. This is a green hell. Faster! Faster! Faster! What happened to El Goyo? Barreito left him bleeding on the mountain. I know the guy you mean. - Wasn't he named Bigua? - That's right. He escaped one night and tried to get to the river. And? They hunted him down and shot him on the mountain. Lunch is over, let's move! Move along to the office! Twenty-three fifty. Next! Look what they gave me for twelve pesos! Thieves! - Three pesos. - Three pesos? This is unfair! - Two-eighty. - Got a smaller one? They're slowly starving and working us to death! -How can you expect me to pay? -If you don't like it, go somewhere else! - I have a wife and three kids to feed! - Get out! How can you charge this for half a kilo of corn flour? If you want to complain, go to the office. It came untied. Give it to me. Hold it here. Let's go, Santos. Come here. I want to tell you something. All these days I've looked at you without noticing what you're like. What am I like? Very beautiful. The only beautiful thing here. - Let's go, Santos. - Why? - It's late. - I like being alone with you. - No, Santos. Please. - What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid. But I don't want you to look at me that way. The way Barreito does. The way they all do. I thought you were different. Are you angry? And if you don't want to go to the party? If they give you an order, it's the whip if you refuse. Look! Save me the first waltz with her! All I'm saving for you is a knife in the gut! Don't look at me, brunette, your look is seductive because you make me suffer, charming brunette. Without your love, this life is horribly lonely With you, it's paradise, charming brunette. [lyrics in Guarani] It's not my fault I'm all yours You lull me to sleep White dove, dove of my love. Listen to my sad tone I don't sing, just cry. I'm your slave, brunette Charming brunette. The day you love me I'll sing as I do now. I'll sing with all my soul Charming brunette. [lyrics in Guarani] It's not my fault I'm all yours. You lull me to sleep White dove, dove of my love - How are you, old fellow? - Fine. At least the people can enjoy themselves once in awhile. The entertainment isn't for us. It's for them. None of them has a woman. When they need one, they organize a dance and people come to Puerto Allica. They have no respect for anything! That's my wife, boss! What do I care? Just because she's your wife you have to dance with her all night? Look, what did I tell you? If you're looking for trouble, you'll find it! Not at all, boss. It's late, I want to go home! Let her go! And let the rest of us dance! Get going! I'm glad I don't have a wife! I've always preferred this. Where were you? Where were you, bitch? Why didn't you bring your daughter so she could enjoy herself? Don't you know the boss ordered everyone to come? She's sick. I left her at home. Where are you going, buddy? No one leaves without the boss's permission! Don't be stubborn! Amelia! What's wrong? Why are you avoiding me? Because a misfortune befell me. What misfortune? Can't you tell me? No. I couldn't look you in the eye. And some things can't be told. Did you know Amelia's father is getting sicker and sicker? Poor old man. They say he went blind. We should have gone to see him. Don't you want to go by his shack tomorrow? - Aren't you going to bed? - I'm not sleepy. You remember Flor de Lis? It's strange. I can't get her out of my mind. But she's far away. And the one you love isn't. It's as if she weren't here. - You haven't seen Santos? - I have. - He knows I'm ill? - I think so. It's strange that he hasn't come to see me. - Amelia! - What? - Is someone here? - No. Leave the shack, come on! ¿Who is it? - Who's there? - Santos and Rufino. I knew they'd come. I knew they wouldn't leave me alone. Of course we wouldn't leave you alone. - How are you feeling? - Trying to rest my old bones. Amelia, bring some fresh mate. Sit down here. I was telling Amelia, it was strange you hadn't come. I thought you'd forgotten us. That's not it, but with work... I'm glad that you've come. Nights are so long now... Too many hours thinking... Not about myself, my race is run. But... I feel I have very little time left I can tell you this, since you've become like a son to me. And because I know you and Rufino are good people. If I leave you... Set your mind at ease. If that happens, I promise that Rufino and I won't ever leave Amelia alone. Thank you. Drink this. It'll do you good. You have to rest, child, you haven't slept all night. I know. I'm going to start cleaning all this up. No, Dona Flor, please. I want to be left alone. All right, child. - I'll come back later. - Thank you. Do you want me to go too? I have to get used to being alone. Why? You've got me, don't you? Come here. Look. The poor old man was here just yesterday. Let's do what we would if he were still here. In front of him, I take you as my wife, forever. For better and for worse, as long as we both shall live. Get in line! Walk forward! - The record book. - How many? - Forty-nine. - How many women? - Fifteen. - Collect their weapons. Throw knives out! The old women who can't work have to go back to Posadas. I'm sick of them sending me useless people! And that woman? She's not indentured. She paid for her trip. - Why have you come here? - To stay. - To cut yerba mate? - To do whatever...but to stay. To do whatever? Your hands are too fine to hold a machete. Besides, you're very beautiful. Why are you here? Answer! She's looking for Rufino Peralta. Peralta! I'm sorry, honey, but you wasted your time. I beat him to it. - Move her things to my shack. - Who are you to give me orders? I'm the boss! Everything here is mine! The land, the men, the yerba. I can give you a good life... or fifty lashes! Come on. That scoundrel Barreito even makes us work on Sundays. You'll see, friend, one of these days I'll... What the...hold this. I'll be right back. - Your brother here? - Rufino! We need to talk. Come here. Excuse me, boss. Can I see the woman who came looking for me? You can't see her. If she came looking for me, why can't I see her? Because I say so! - Is she your woman? - Yes. Here nothing is yours, not even your own skin. That woman is everyone's. Or didn't you know what she did in Posadas? Let that be the last time you ask me questions! Walk away! Beto Villega! Six bundles. Five and a half bundles. - Benito Cruz. - Six bundles. You didn't think I would come, did you? I've thought so much about you, you can't imagine. Why does this happen, falling in love so suddenly. It's so strange that this happened to me. I've never loved anyone, you know. They sold me when I was just a girl. Since then, I've hated men. Until I met you. Let's leave here, Rufino. Take me far away from this hell. Where no one knows me. If you want, we'll start over. I need you to love me. - Let's go. - When? Tonight. Let me talk to my brother. Stay here! You'll regret this for the rest of your lives! Get them out of here! Have I beat the gall out of you yet? Beat! Beat! That's that. Put her on the first boat to Posadas. And you fellows go ahead and have your way with her. Coward! Coward! Buddy, listen to me, I've been here for six years and I've seen a lot. Once this guy Taboada escaped... They chased him, and he was never heard from again. Later they found him nailed to a post. And we heard about Ramos, and Alejos and Bigua... Of all those who ran, none got out alive. I've escaped from worse places than this. I'm still here. Alive and kicking. It's hard to get to the river by going over the mountain. I'm a seasoned guide. I swear I'll get there. And if we don't, it's better to die on the mountain than to stay and be treated like animals. Like what happened to Rufino the other day. - You're right! I'm going too! - Me too! And if you make it to Posadas what will you do there? Starve to death? Not anymore! In the south the mensus have formed a union to defend themselves. My brother says so in this letter they read to me this morning. Who here can read? Give it to me. Dear brother, we are very happy here. They treat us well. It isn't like in Alto Parana. They pay us in cash and we shop where we want. I have some money saved up. The work isn't so bad. The bosses and overseers don't dare kill anyone They don't even punish the workers because they know the union would come and fight. Here we are no longer slaves but men like any other. And this union thing? What's it like? See this stump? Alone I can't even budge it. But all of us together can, no? That's what a union is like. One man can't do it alone, but all of us together can! And this union, where is it? Everywhere! In Bomplan, in San Ignacio, in Santa Ana. - What are we waiting for then? - I'm going too! - Who else? - Me! - And you, Silvio? - I'm staying. And you, Santos? Coming? My brother wouldn't make it. And I can't leave Amelia alone. She's expecting a child. Who's coming? Who left? Jacinto, Isidro, El Goyo, Pintos and Baez. I hope they're lucky and make it to the river. They'll make it. They have the whole night. Until they notice they're gone and hunt them down with rifles. So what? It's better to take a bullet than to stay here. We should've gone with them. That's what we should've done. You wouldn't have made it a mile with what you've got. But I've also got what it takes to be a man! Why didn't you come let me know? I would have left with them. Why didn't we leave? I already told you. Because of you and her. And because of your child. You don't even know if it's yours! Say that again! I'll break you in two! A woman always knows who the father is. The father is Santos. Forgive me. I didn't know what I was saying. Someone snitched on them. They killed Baez. With age comes wisdom... Where are you going? - Why did you bring him? - To bury him like a Christian. Bring him into the office. If you don't pay what you owe with work, you'll pay another way! I won't put up with any rebelliousness here. There's always someone who wants to tempt death! But no one messes with Aguilera, understand? No one who lived to tell the tale. You'll bow your heads or we'll make you bow them with bullets. Rufino and Santos Peralta! You have weapons. Turn them in! All right, boss. We'll turn them in. Rufino, I'm taking the horse! Go on, Santos. For Amelia... and your child. They're going over the mountain! Let's catch them at the river! I'll stay by the road, you cut them off at the river! Don't move. Don't kill me. I'll let you go! And as Santos Peralta walked towards freedom the revolution spread all through the North. Untie me! Untie me! We'll let the panthers untie you. No! Don't leave me here! I'm the boss! Don't leave me here! I'm the boss! The cry of liberty spread from place to place like the song of free birds in the jungle. The deaths of Baez, Rufino Peralta, and so many others had not been in vain. Their blood had flowed over the fields. It had mixed with the water of the river and it had fertilized the seed planted in the hearts of the mensus, leaving its legacy to the children of a brighter future. It was the promise of a greater and fairer fatherland where men would not be slaves.
