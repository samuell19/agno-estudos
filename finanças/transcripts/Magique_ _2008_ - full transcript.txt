MAGIC What classes do you have? Geography, math, science and tech. - What about English? - Yes. Do your story? It doesn't matter anyway. Doesn't matter? You have to speak English. Soon everyone will speak Chinese! Go, you'll be late. 6 months behind. I warn you, you'd better pay up. You know my situation... Save your story for the bailiff. He'll soon pay you a visit. What about the barn roof? Think I can redo it, given what you owe? Not redo, repair. That's upkeep, your responsibility. - What's this? - Nothing. Were you fighting? Why? Because. No reason. Kids don't fight for no reason. What? Louis called Dad an ectoplasm! What's an ectoplasm? You didn't fight over that? He insulted me. I insulted him! What did you say? I called him a "fat little pig". And you're surprised he got mad? He is ugly and fat. It's true! Tommy, you got mad at your only friend. What'll you do now, all alone? I'm always all alone. You and me are always all alone. What do you mean? "The day has come to an end" "The house is calm and quiet" "Mommy's gone to bed" "The moon caresses the horizon" "All you pretty stars in the sky" "Little fireflies that shine" "For you it's always Christmas time" "Down here it's dark, it's night" "You glide through the universe," "At a thousand kilometers per second," "You gaze down at Earth," "Just a little marble, so round" "One day I know you'll return" "You'll descend from the stars" "Your voyage will be over" "And you'll take me in your arms" It could be better. Why do you take on so much? Get some help. I'm managing. I don't need help. Sure, as long as the weather's nice. Come winter you'll call for help. And Tommy, how's he doing? Just fine. He still has his imaginary father. He really believes that? Are you sure? I don't know. I should talk to him, but I can't. You really should. Silences hurt kids more than words. Even words they don't want to hear. Well, there he is. At least you have color! Is Mom sick? I was getting honey for my grandkids. I fly to Vancouver tomorrow. A year since I saw them. Is that the whole truth? She's a bit tired. It's more mental than physical. Which means? Which means she's a bit... melancholic. What's melancholy? It's hard to explain, Tommy lad. Is there anything I can do? Make her laugh a little. But there's no need to turn into a clown. Love her a whole bunch, and be good to her. The clouds will pass, you'll see. Off you go! "Woman, twenty-nine, single, one child" "Physically looks fine," "Temperament mild" "Seeks a man 30 to 35," "Smart, charming and kind," "Who loves fresh air and the countryside" "A little email, a message in a bottle" "A little email, a message in the clouds" "I love quiet moments, long afternoons on my bike" "Dancing, cooking and piano I like" "I'm seeking a man 30 to 35, single, naturally" "A morning man, strong and sturdy" "A little email, tell me what you love and hate" "A little email," (1000 FUNNY STORIES) Sleep well? Yes, but not much. Why not? Nightmares? I read a book. At least it wasn't video games. Mom? How do you hammer a nail and not hit your finger? No idea. Just hold the hammer with 2 hands! I know another one! Why have Indians been cold since 1492? I don't know. Because Columbus discovered them. Dis-covered! Funny, huh? Yes, very funny. (MAGIC) Papers, what papers? The forms, you know what I mean. The forms. Ever heard of deforestation? I don't see the connection. Of course not. Given all the papers we fill out annually, the Amazon'll be treeless! Happy? Brazil will become a desert. What's happening? A permit problem. They can't stay here. They have to pull stakes by tomorrow. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Scram. I'll get the lions! Are you performers? Good eye. - What kind? - Take a guess. Lion tamers? Never! What, then? Have a seat. "We're clowns so comical" "Sweet, silly and beautiful" "We're Siamese bros"' "Joined at the funny bone" "He is me, and I am he I am he, and he is me" "He's king of pirouettes" "He's an illustrious poet" "We get along famously" "Sun is high, we're happy" "He is me, and I am he I am he, and he is me" "When in your neighborhood" "We turn bad vides good" "Our smiles, contagious!" "You'll soon applaud us" "He is me, and I am he I am me, and he is he" "He is me, and I am he I am he, and he is me" - When's the show? - Never. They're treating us like criminals. Unless we find another. Where'd you get that crazy idea? They have nowhere else! They could've asked the mayor for a permit. Just for 3 days. Stop, Tommy. What's this? I should take pity? But look at all the space we have! They were chased away. Is that fair? Go eat your snack. Mom? What if we were in the same boat? In what way? If we were thrown out because of some rule. 2, 3 wagons, didn't you say? No way, I said 4 or 5. Well it sure wasn't 6 or 7. Where's Bingo? Did anyone see Bingo? He was behind us. He was at the end of the line. Maybe he got lost. Mr. Einstein! Mr. Einstein! Mr. Einstein! Bingo Mr. Einstein! Bingo He'll get here, don't worry. He has the big top, the canvas. Mr. Einstein! Archibald. Take the car. Find him. - Why me? - That's an order. 25 there, 50 there. In all, about 300. 300? At 50,000 per hive, that's 15 million bees. She does it all by herself? Just her and me. - And your dad is? - In heaven. Sorry, I didn't know. - He's an astronaut. - Astronaut? Astronaut, yes. Mr. Einstein? Mr. Einstein Mr. Einstein Quite the man, your little man. Stubborn as a mule. What did he say to lure you here? That you'd really enjoy it. I see. You're very brave. Looking after a child is not what I call brave. I mean the farm, fields. A lot of work for one person. That boy sure can't hold his tongue. Alice! Alice! Have you seen my saw? It's right here. I've been searching for a half-hour! You didn't find him? I drove every road within 30 kilometers, and Bingo is nowhere. He must be somewhere. Call the police. He has no papers. They'd deport him. We gotta try something. Classifieds! Think he'll be reading the papers? A friend found her husband that way, 8 years later. Let's try it! What can we lose? I found Mr. Einstein. In a field flirting with your lady dog! She's a he. Mom? Yes. Come see! Come see! There's a performing dog. Can't you see I'm busy? Come on, Mom. Ladies and gentlemen! He jumps like a monkey. He jumps like a antelope. He walks on two legs like a man. He does headstands and double summersaults, daring tricks for a dog. He swims like a dolphin. If he had wings, he'd fly like a sparrow. This is no dog. This is a genius! Ladies and gents, Mr. Einstein! Let's start with something really hard for us, but easy as pie for him: The double backward summersault! Playing the diva. Just like him, a mind of his own. Since you won't move, sing us something. Are you ready? I've told you a thousand times, not during the show. Before or after, but never during! I'm sorry. I guess we'll have to postpone until tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen. Come on! That's OK, he'll do his act another time. Let's go eat. "A little email, a message in a bottle" "A little email, a message in the clouds" "Such a beautiful sky, and yet there's sadness" "Such a beautiful sky, and so much loneliness" Don't stand there, Tommy. Over here. Spin him around. - Hurt yourself? - He did it. I'm his loyal partner, but he often misses. You miss? Sometimes, yes. Go, I'll be there soon. Yes, I miss because I love her. The target, I don't care. I always hit the bull's eye. But it's different with Zynovia. It's love that blinds me. Her name's Zynovia? It sure is. A strange first name. It's Russian. What's your name? Archibald. Archibald. Archibald and Zynovia. More exotic than Maurice and Yvette. You know some big words. Know what "ectoplasm" means? Isn't that a kind of ghost, or something? Do you like your job? I'm the happiest person ever riding him. So it's not a job! Is a job you enjoy work or pleasure? Both, maybe? It's absolute bliss! And what makes you happiest? Right now, I don't know. I'll see, for later. Later. There's no such thing. "You can't lock it in a cage" "You can't trap it in a bottle" "You can't keep it on a leash" "It needs no baggage to travel" "No guards watch over it" "It never gives out its address" "It drops by unannounced" "Nobody knows where it hides" "Happiness is not elsewhere, not tomorrow" "Happiness is not yesterday, not somewhere else" "Happiness follows its own chosen road" "Happiness comes when you don't call" "It fits in the palm of your hand" "In a smile, in a tear" "In a single drop of sunshine, in a single drop of rain" "It fits in the palm of your hand" "In a breeze, in a flame" "In the secret world of slumber" "It's Ariane's thread" "It grows at the rainbow's edge" "Life is its best friend" "Happiness is not elsewhere, not tomorrow" "Happiness is not yesterday, not somewhere else" "Happiness follows its own chosen road" "Happiness comes when you don't call" Why toss out your bear? Don't you like him? I'm too old. What'll you do? Put him away with my other baby toys. A clown, that's great. Do you kid around all the time? All the time. - Got a red nose? - Of course! So dumb. Why? "My red nose Makes the kids laugh" "Laugh till they pee their pants" "They laugh and laugh and laugh" "My nose cheers up moms and dads" "Gives dreams to people who are sad" "That can't be bad, can't be bad, can't be bad" "My nose shows life in a funny light" "Like getting tickled every night" "So much delight, so much delight, so much delight" "My nose paints the world pink" "Brings us back from the brink" "No need to think, no need to think, no need to think" At your age, I had a great tree house. But yours, congratulations! - Cigarette? - Don't smoke. Me neither! They're chocolate. Okay, thanks. Get it before the government outlaws these, too. What's your funniest act? We have lots. But the funniest? Maybe the four-armed musicians. Kids love it. - Not adults? - Them too, everyone! Did you really lose the big top? We have the pole, pegs, seats, but without the canvas... You can't perform? Without it, the acrobats might fly off. Tommy, it's late. No it isn't. You'll complain about getting up. - Mom? - Yes. Summer vacation starts tomorrow. Right, I completely forgot. Eat up or it'll get cold. So, what do you think? It's ok for kids, but for adults it's dumb. What else do you have? We have lots more. What do you want? "We ride bikes on our head, play flutes in bed" "Make you laugh till you're red, dance the tango fandango" Won't make her laugh. "We use our hands to dance tango" "We wear hats galore" "We play sax with ease" "We tell riddles by the score and even jokes in Japanese" Won't make her laugh. "We yodel, skate in our socks" "We sing pretty as punch, tap dance round the clock" That won't make her laugh. "We jump high as kangaroos" "We dance the funky chicken" "We shimmy, twist and mambo" "Our mashed potato" "Is finger lickin'" "We get 'em grinning!" "Even Buster Keaton!" "We're funny as can be" "When it comes to fun we're tops" "3 new messages" Your lines are very thin. Which means? Your soul is warm, you're very sensitive. What'd you like to know? "Love line I'm wondering," "Is love somewhere on my path?" "Will I find" "My eternal fiancé?" "Show me the signs" "In my lines" "Where is he inscribed, the soul I seek" "And who seeks me?" "And if my hand" "Paints my destiny," "Who might the painter be?" "If these lines are the book" "Of my life," "Who might the writer be?" "Who might the writer be?" I love skipping rocks with flat ones. I'm really good. I almost won Best in France. I did 34 skips! When you say almost won, that means you lost? A bottle half-empty or one half-full. Depends if you're a pessimist or optimist. It's still the same bottle. I prefer mine completely full! So you want to make your mom laugh? It's for her melancholy. The doctor said that's her illness. I don't know what it means. No one will explain. "It's a sadness that won't go away" "An image you can't erase" "A blue shadow that takes your joy away" "A bitter low you can't keep at bay" "A black sun, a dark carnivorous flower" "Freezing cold water, icing through your veins" "A winter sky, a bird with an evil eye" "A bitter taste, a scent of burning waste" "Chagrin that overflows within" "A breeze, monotonous languor" "A thief slipping in on the sly" "A bitter heartbreak, that's what melancholy is" You know, Tommy, sometimes we can't help those we love. I'm sure I can do something. The good Lord maybe, but you're just a little guy. Like me. Maybe she doesn't mind being sad. People want to laugh, not cry. Not always. Laughter isn't happiness. The best thing for you might be... Might be? Act as if everything's ok. Live like you want, be happy! That might make her happy. When I was little I hated the circus. The clowns really scared me. Me too. But you chose to become one. I've only been a clown for three years. What did you do before? Night watchman, dog walker, shoe salesman, hairdresser for 2 days. Pizza deliveryman, nude model for art students! Truck driver, tile layer, and a waiter at the Moulin Rouge. A strange life. A kind of strange life, yes. I envy you. I'm stuck here. I might meet 30 people in a year. I see thousands of faces but never meet anyone. I wonder what I'm fleeing. When I get fed up, in winter, I dream of setting down roots... "Is someone looking for me," "Someone who needs me?" "Is someone searching" "For a sign from me?" "Is a warm home" "Silently awaiting me?" "Will a fierce wind" "Blow away my loneliness?" "Will a sunny room" "Soon light my mornings?" "Will a loving hand" "Soon caress my own?" "Will a lovely pair of eyes" "Gaze at me tenderly?" "Will a secret love" "Reveal herself to me?" How many times do I have to tell you? But I need to ask you something! Then call me on my cell phone. Do not come here! But you never answer! I must be working. That's all you do. We're never together. We've been together for 10 years. Sometimes we need a break. He seems really mad. That's his laboratory. Where he creates his magic tricks. - Off limits. - Even for his wife? Especially her. He has many secrets. He cuts her into pieces every night, but he won't tell her how. And she lets him? He can do everything, make it rain or shine. Hey, look. The Fellinis! A great bubble act. Wonderful! They're rehearsing: 4 hours of bubbles a day! Go take a look. You make big ones, you little ones. Maybe cause I'm big! I think the big are prettiest. It's not one or the other. No need to choose. You can be big and beautiful, or small and beautiful. "Big is beautiful" "Small is beautiful" "One does not prevent the other" "There is day, there is night" "There is sun, there is rain" "One does not prevent the other" "There is white, there is black" "On both sides of the tracks" "One does not prevent the other" "There is summer, there is winter" "They coincide and coexist" "There is laughter, there are tears" "One doesn't prevent the other" "There is sour, there is sweet" "Coolness and heat" "One does not prevent the other" "Weakness, strength."

A nice one. It's so nice and plump. Give me a hand. Ready? One, two, three! A bit more. - You're fatter. - That's life, huh? Lunch! They're picking our lunch. Into the basket. They're so small! But deeply in love. Doesn't prevent the other. What is it? For the starter we have... "Grasshoppers stuffed with poppies, ladybug fricassee" "Grilled caterpillar, red ants and lice" "Wait and see, it's so fine" "Every day there's a special" For the main course: "Fly kebabs au jus, sauteed wasps covered in roux" "Try our delicious Maggots Peking or Cocoon a la King" "Wait and see, it's so fine" "Every day there's a special" "And for dessert?" "Butterfly wing sorbet, cream of firefly hearts" "Our flea cake is homemade and our mosquito tarts" "Wait and see, it's so fine" "Every day there's a special" Go on, try it. Flies, what a treat! - Mom? - Yes. Watch. Choose a card. Then put it back. One, two, three. It's this one. How'd you do it? Want to see? "It's starting to work its magic I caught her smiling today" "She looks happier, not so tragic Her melancholy is drifting away" "I'll be easy to recognize," "Red shirt and black pants" "Get a table on the window, 3 o'clock at the Art Cafe" "It's starting to work its magic Her sadness is disappearing" "How thrilled I would be to see her start laughing" "A little email, a message in the clouds" "A little email, a message in a bottle" "Message sent!" Hey! Hey! You'll see. What's so special about this tree? - Attracts them. - What? You'll soon see. Is it far? 10 minutes. Down by the river. - What do we do now? - Wait. One hour? Two? Until they get here. Auguste? Yes. How many times does one fall in love? Some, one time. Others, hundreds. Some are always in love, others never. And you? Well, my love life is pretty complicated. One girlfriend was married to a football player. Six foot ten, 260 pounds! Then I fell in love... They're coming! Where? There! Yeah. It's fantastic! Please, is anyone there? Could someone help me? Over there. I'm here, in the box. There. Oh, it's you. What're you doing out now? What happened? Where's you husband? I asked the wrong question. We had a fight and he left. But like this? It's not the first time. I find all my sections eventually, but this is no fun. And the nights are chilly. Why did he do it? I don't know. "My husband is so sensitive I said something I shouldn't have" "He glared at me full of anger" "He stormed off and left me here" "Where are my feet? Where can my breasts and hips be?" "I'm forsaken and forlorn, and I don't feel very womanly" "My feet, where did my pretty feet go?" "My bottom, where did my pretty bottom go?" "My breasts, So pretty though small?" "My arms I can't find my arms at all!" I found the arms! I found the arms! "My head no longer belongs to me He has cut me in three" "Who will find my hips, arms, behind..." I found the feet! "My feet, where did my pretty feet go?" "My bottom, Where did my pretty bottom go?" "My breasts, so pretty though small" "My arms, I can't find my arms at all!" "He hid the boxes away Took his saw and ran from me" "Now I'm at his mercy" "And my itchy nose is bugging me!" You're saved! How do we fit you back together? I'll do it, I'm used to it. You sure? Anyway, it's a secret. He doesn't know I know and if he knew you did too, he'd cut me up in rings! I'm looking for Mr. Einstein. You should tie him up! He's not a pit bull. We'll talk the day he bites a child. Mimi! Mimi! Have you seen Mr. Einstein? No. Bartek! Mr. Einstein... Mr. Einstein... Mr. Einstein... - He's so wily. - Who? Mr. Einstein. We're doing a project together. - What? - It's a secret. Come on, tell me. Come see tonight. But keep your lips sealed. My lips pealed? Sealed. - Pealed? - No, sealed. Pealed? Sealed! Lips sealed. You do it on purpose, huh? Here! Your ad made it in. Super, thanks. - Bye. - Bye. "Ban this member?" You know, Tommy, sometimes in life we make mistakes and don't know how to fix them. There's something I never told you... Something important. It's about your dad. You've created a whole story in your head, but now that you're big... Just like the sea! With pictures of the sea, it's super. Want to try? Yeah, sure. I was getting fed up! Sorry, I had to wait until Dr. Klebs took his nap. Sit down. You'll see. Mr. Einstein, you're on! "It'll end, my nightmare story" "I got a ticket to fame and glory" "Being a dog ain't no picnic" "You better be sure you believe in it" "Showbiz is full of nitwits" "They say, for a bastard" "Hard knocks come faster" "But I feel strong as a tiger" "My words will carry me higher" "If I work hard I'll go far" "And for my big night" "They'll put my name in lights" "I'm out the starting gate" "I won't be too late" "I'm marking out my territory" "I'm ready as can be" "To go down in history" He seems happy. It's like a dream for him. But he'll have to wake up one day. What keeps you here, far from everything, all alone? Maybe I like silence. You could leave. Move closer to a city. For me this isn't punishment. And him? Being all alone isn't good for a kid. Someone will show up some day. You won't believe me, I see stars in your eyes. No, I don't believe you. Not bad. Not bad? Is that all? A mere not bad? I hear you can make it rain or shine. Who said that? Auguste, but I know he's wrong. - Wrong? - Of course. Follow me. Wrong! Take a slip of paper. What is it? The wind. The wind. Another one. - What do we have? - Snow. Snow. Thanks. A third. Rain. Rain. - And then? - Beautiful weather. Beautiful weather. Beautiful weather. Thanks. Go sit down. Yes. Are you ready? Away we go! And so? Not bad? Why come all this way? For the red clover in the valley. We get fabulous clover honey. I wish my dad could've seen this land. He was an avid beekeeper. He wanted me to take over his bees one day. On the day I arrived here, he cut all ties with me. I sent him so many letters, but he never replied. Maybe it's not too late. It'll soon be 4 years since he died. Mom. "Happiness is not elsewhere, not tomorrow" "Happiness is not yesterday, not somewhere else" "Happiness comes when you don't call" As a kid, I loved big open spaces, too. I wanted to travel, see the country. To be a sailor, to try exploring, prospecting. What's that? Searching for gold. But there's something even better than that. What? Finding gold. I'll tour the world, go all the way to Zanzibar. - Tour the moon, too? - And tour the moon. But when I'm big... I'll be old. "I'll go around the world" "I'll speak every language," "Even Chinese" "Flowers will line my path," "As I search for happiness" "And on our planet" "War will be banished" "I'll gaze up at the stars" "I'll choose one that dazzles" "I'll count the grains of sand" "In the palm of my hand" "I'll go for a stroll" "On the beach alone" "Under the stars," "No heavy load" "I'll have a nice place to live" "And plenty of kids" "I'll plant trees by the thousands" "I'll be a painter or a musician," "An explorer" "Or maybe even" "A famous clothing designer" "I'll frolic in the spring" "The sun will warm me" "I'll take a wondrous voyage" "To the land of Gods and sages" "I'll sing" "Morning and night" "I'll be calm," "I'll be serene" "When I'm big" "I'll be old" "We'll be happy" "When I'm old" "I'll be big" "Every day bright and bold" Unbelievable! Here's Bingo. Great. Great. At last! Where were you? We looked everywhere. So? Lost, no map or compass. Ok, we get it. How'd you find us? By chance. I got lost, went looking, got lost again, and while I was lost I found you. Do you understand? I'm here! I'm here friends! I'm here, friends! What? What is it? Nothing. I was thinking. I look stupid, right? So take it off. If you want to get eaten alive. But you'd better not. What do I do? First, you lift the cover. Take out the frame, one hand on each side. Beautiful, huh? You sweep toward the bottom. Gently, gently. I was stung! - No you weren't. - I was, under the glove. Did you pat the horse this morning? I brushed him. That's why. Bees hate the smell of horses. There, all better. Lucky you're not allergic. - I am allergic. - Really? At 8, I almost died because of a wasp. I'll give you an adrenaline injection. A needle? You want to prick me? A sissy, are you? Forget it. The wasp was also 8 years old. My first broken heart. I now know the remedy for heartbreak. Really, what is it? The remedy for heartbreak... is love. "We don't see it coming" "Without knowing, we're waiting" "It doesn't bother to knock" "It doesn't carry a clock" "Sometimes it catches us unaware" "As if by magic it is there" "It looks for an in" "Blows in with the wind" "We gaze at each other so happily" "Now we are" "No longer so lonely" "Two hearts beating bright" "in love's mysterious light" - Is he with you? - Who? Mr. Einstein. He met your dog. Since then, I haven't seen him. Rocky knows his way. They'll come back. I fear the worst. His own personal rebellion. I have no authority over him. Was he raised badly? Badly raised, by me? I devoted my life to him, gave him everything. All the big trainers know I'm one of the best. I'm maybe even the best. I've trained cats, wolves, mice, elephants, boas, bonobos, platypuses, baboons, buffalos, mountain sheep, butterflies. I made sloths work. I even made a gull gavotte. I made a frog sing Ave Maria. 10,000 years ago I could've been head trainer on Noah's Ark! I'm sure Mr. Einstein will come back. I pray. I'm nothing without him. I'm lost. You feel abandoned, right? Right. Me too, since I was little. There they are! Come here. A youthful folly, you might say. Seeing the result, it was a delightful mistake. His father was an artist. A guitar player. He was from Quebec. Good singer. A big smile and a big talker! He said he was in love with me. And I got pregnant. I came to Montreal to join him, but he'd vanished into thin air. I never saw him again. I don't know why but Tommy, when he was 3 or 4, started believing his dad was an astronaut. More original than Santa Claus. At first, I found it cute. But when he got older, at 7 or 8, I said it had gone on long enough. I had to tell him the truth. I tried many times. I couldn't find the words. Tommy. Tommy. Please forgive me. Forgive you, why? Not knowing how to talk to you. "For my silence, for my negligence" "For all the words I never could say" "For the secrets, for the lie" "And for stealing your dreams" "For my clumsiness, For my insistence" "On keeping up appearances" "For my weakness, for your strife" "For tainting your young life" "I was a fool, I was so distressed" "I let you believe in happiness" "There is no rocket, no hero" "No explorer in the sky" "For his absence, for the dagger" "Planted in your little heart" "For your sadness, for all the pain" "I've caused you because I love you" Some dumb crooner. Hey, he's a musician. Astronaut, ok, though I didn't really believe it. But between that and a loser musician, there's a big, big difference. Right you are. Mom with Elton John in a dayglo suit. Scary. Dayglo, how do you know? - My mom told me. - Really. Not everything, just the tie. Clothing isn't all. What do you mean? The latest Nikes don't win you the 100-meter race. Tonight at 9, an amazing presentation by Cirque Magique. A show for all who love to laugh. With acts and poetry for everyone from 1 to 100! Come one, come all. I repeat, tonight at 9 o'clock, an amazing performance by Cirque Magique! A show for those who love to laugh. With acts and poetry! From 1 to 100! Tonight we play 10 km away. I know. Then we head for the U.S. In 3 weeks it's over. We pack up and each head off until next year. You'll return to France? Perpignan, know it? Is someone waiting for you? My cat. I hope he recognizes me. - Here. - Thanks. He's never flown. Maybe he'd like it. Maybe. Will you stay here all alone in winter? Maybe someone loves silence like me. Maybe. My address and phone number, in case. Why are you smiling? No reason. Is that it? You're leaving? You could stay a couple more days. Will you miss us? We will too! Where'll you sleep? As usual, in our trailer. If one day you are discouraged... If you are sad... If you are feeling bored... Think of us and remember one thing. Everything is here in your heart!

You missed me, did you? I'm disappointed. Saltwater taffy. My daughter's specialty! That's nice. How are you? Something to tell me? I'm fine. Even to an old friend who can keep a secret? I'm fine, thanks. How's it going, Tommy? I did what you said. And did it work? Yes and no. What do you mean? To start, no, then yes, and finally no. All kinds of things were going on. First, the circus. They lost the big top, then found it. And my dad is no astronaut, as I guessed. He's some musician. I don't even know his name. Then Baptiste. He and Mom... Slow down, you've lost me. They got together. That's life. They danced. That's life. They slept together. That's life but... She wants him to stay, he wanted to. He left and she didn't stop him. I'm all confused! Know the story about the dog that chased trains? I don't know. He'd be in big trouble if he caught one. And sometimes men and women, it's the same thing. We dream of loving, but when he or she shows up, we hesitate. There's love and, at the same time, there's fear. Fear of what? Fear of loving. "...an amazing presentation by Cirque Magique!"

Then Mizar, Alioth, Megrez Phecda, Merak and Dubhe. That's the Great Bear. And when you're lost, don't know what to do, don't know where to turn, you look at the sky and you will find your way.
