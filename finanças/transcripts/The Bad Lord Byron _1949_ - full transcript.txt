Subtitles by Nostromo My dearest Augusta today I write to you from Greece which come to its expectations the land of fog and bog It has rained every day for a month The roads are impassable and our war against the Turks is fought entirely on paper between Suliote chiefs German barons,English volunteers and adventurers of all nations We are as goodly an allied army as ever quarreled beneath the same banner I have been ill for some days but my chief malady is lack of action not lack of health The time has come when we can wait no longer Either we make contact with Odysseos and begin the campaign in earnest Or we stay here and admit defeat What do you want to do? We start now ride over to meet Odysseos -But roads are impassable -Nothing is impossible We've got to do it How do we go? We will go You're not well enough you know what the doctor said I am going and we leave in half an hour Fletcher order the horses My lord I promise the Contessa Do as I say Yes ,My Lord Byron you should not go That is all gentlemen we leave in 30 minutes Do you really think you should go? I must You like adventure,hmm? Prince Mavrocordato I did not come here for adventure I came to assist in the rebirth of a nation True,but you should have some thought for yourself If you continue like this You'll go back to England an invalid No,I shall never leave Greece Neither the Turks nor Greeks Or your infernal climate will prevent that Pietro Pietro Go on without me You should never have come It's no good We will turn back No,you must get through You must Pietro will look after me I order you to go Now Aya,elate,elate How is he doctor? Just the same,just the same I have bled him again He must rest now Very good,doctor The mail boat is in Is there anything from the committee? This one's from Mr Hobhouse Read it Read it for me,please He says your affairs are in good shape Your debts are being paid off Your name and character will stand far above those of any of your contemporaries And that everyone in England is saying the same Is that all? He says it's entirely because of your qualities of leadership and self-sacrifice That they have raised the subscription of Two and a half million pounds for the Greek campaign So they have forgiven me They've forgiven me at last Now I can die in peace You mustn't talk of dying,Byron Oh yes I shall die For all it's known I shall die at the Phyllis(?) I've lived I have not lived in vain My mind may lose its force My blood its fire My frame have I achieved in conquering pain There is that within me Which will tire and torture time And breathe when I expire He treated me bad Mad,bad,mad He treated me shamefully He was a monster Don't you realize Any woman would leave you I shall come with you I will never leave you never never They say you're bad bad dangerous to know Is it true? Is it true? Is it true? Is it true or is it untrue? That is what this Court has to decide Is Lord Byron to be numbered among the angels? Or among the Devils? Is he to be remembered as a soldier and a hero or as a drunkard and a seducer as a great poet or a great cad You will hear the evidence and make up your minds what your verdict must be Bring in the accused Your name? George Gordon Neville Lord Byron of Newstead Your occupation? I have several Poet,soldier,lover and I hope gentleman Lord Byron Are you aware of the charges made against you? Yes What is your answer to them? I have no answer to give I'm quite content to await the verdict of this court Very well Mr Prosecutor you may call your witnesses Call Lady Caroline Lamb Lady Caroline Lamb Your name? Caroline Lamb And your rank? I am the wife of the Honorable William Lamb Lady Caroline you know Lord Byron? Intimately Where did you first meet him? At my aunt's house It was at a ball was it not? No it was after the ball was over But I understood Oh yes I saw him at the ball but he was otherwise engaged And now Mr Rogers we shall meet Lord Byron -But my dear Lady Caroline -For once I think you shall introduce.. There were a lot of absurd women swarming around him But he looked up at me where I stood on the stairs And I knew we should meet again -And did you? -Yes The next morning the ball was over but I was still in the ball room Waiting Waiting for me Lady Caroline Why did you refuse to meet me? You were somewhat preoccupied I thought I'd been more preoccupied since I met you A rose? And a carnation in February? I've been told that your Ladyship likes everything that is beautiful and rare for the moment That is true For the moment Tell me Lord Byron They say that you're very wicked That you kept a harem when you were in the East And had a slave girl sewn up into a sack and thrown into the Bosporus Is that true? Not exactly Sacks were so difficult to come by They say that you fought many duels And that you always kill your man Do you deny it? I would never deny anything to you They say that you're mad bad And dangerous to know Is that true too? And what you make of Childe Harold? I haven't read it I congratulate you Must be the only person in England who hasn't In civilized society at any rate What do you call society? The four thousand who are up and the others are in bed And they have all read the poem? Without a doubt today all four thousand came in to tell me so Practically simultaneously That is probably why I've never read it -That and -Hm I hate disenchantment You mean I might fall short of your Ladyship's standards of perfection As a poet perhaps Thank you As a man I'd no doubt After that you saw a great deal of Lord Byron But of course we went everywhere Together we were inseparable Some time later did his manner change towards you? Yes He treated me shamefully Did you leave him? -No -Why not? Because I loved him too much How did he treat you shamefully? Can you give us an example? I can give you a hundred One will be sufficient Very well We were in his rooms and he just finished a new poem I asked if I might read it May I read it? If you wish "She walks in beauty, like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies; and all that's best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes; Thus mellowed to that tender light which heaven to gaudy day denies. One shade the more, one ray the less, had half impaired the nameless grace,which waves in every raven tress" 1813 Byron Byron,who is she? No one,I haven't met her yet Why do you tell me such a lie to me, it's Helen isn't it? No You're going to her house tonight aren't you? Yes,and so are at least a hundred other people You've got to take me Oh no,Caro,please be sensible How can I? I tell you I'm coming too I tell you, you can't Then you've not to go either I've accepted already it's too late to change,I'm going and going alone Now please don't let us discuss it any further We shall see Byron Lady Caroline,why did you stab yourself that night? Because I wanted to die Why? Because he made me so unhappy Thank you Lady Caroline That it is all I had to ask Mr Defender have you any questions? My Lord Lady Caroline, you say the Lord Byron made you so unhappy that you wish to die is that so? Yes But it was your wrist that you cut? Yes -Not your throat? -No I take it that after this distressing occurrence you never saw him again? Did you see Lord Byron again? Yes At his request? No Would it be fair to say that right from the start of this affair You pursued him day and night until you until his wit's end and he know how to escape you? -No, certainly not -But you did see Lord Byron again? -Yes -Often?-Yes At this time you were married? -Yes -To somebody else? Yes And your husband's mother was Lady Melbourne? Yes Do you remember Lady Melbourne calling upon Lord Byron on certain afternoon Just before you went to Ireland? I'm not sure Then let me refresh your memory Lady Melbourne Lady Melbourne this is an honor You know my dear friend -Mrs Leigh -Good afternoon Forgive me but I hope to see you alone And then I'll wait in here You know why I come I can guess,Lady Melbourne Lord Byron,this got to stop The whole of London is talking Poor William is in the most invidious position I know Lady Melbourne I know but what am I to do? Refuse to see her again I have a hundred times but every day four or five times a day She sends a page with a letter for me or a book with some passionate nonsense scrawled in it She's making my life a chaos I'm sorry I knew this would end disastrously She's impossible On the contrary She's the cleverest most agreeable absurd,amiable for picks dangerous fascinating little being that ever lived Except that she should have lived 2,000 years ago What is it? Lady Caroline's page is here again Oh,tell him to go away No wait,now you shall see for yourself Lady Melbourne Bring the letter in to me Oh,the page has orders to deliver the letter only into your own hands,My Lord You see,all right show him in Byron,dear Byron why won't you see me? Why don't you answer my letters? Caroline You make yourself ridiculous What are you doing here? I came here to discuss what should be done with you and and now I know You'll leave for Ireland at once I won't go I won't I'll kill myself You all hate me Hate you? Yes,I think I hate you more than anything else on earth Lady Caroline,you told us earlier that you wrote of Lord Byron that he was mad bad and dangerous to know -Is that so? -Yes Don't you think the same might quite easily be said about you Call Lady Byron -You are the wife of the accused? -Yes Before your marriage you were Miss Anne Isabella Milbanke Yes When did you first meet Lord Byron? It was at a musical soiree at Lady Jersey My mother and I arrived a little late and as we came downstairs I heard the orchestra playing in the drawing room No,we better not disturb them -You mind if we wait along? -Not if we can sit down You must be the only person in London society who has any respect for music I have no respect for London society Too many waltzing parties If they wasn't so fizzy -Outrageous -No mama,nearly stupid Oh,I see at least that we are at not the last to arrive Who is that man? -It looks like Lord Byron -He's abroad No it is,forgive me -Byron -My dear Clare -Mr Hobhouse -How are you? So you're back and in London Ah trying to sell the estates the usual reason Well I am delighted to see you and your brooch Oh yes I know why does one bring these terrible things,Sir Probably because some beautiful Turkish woman gave it to you Oh no,entirely mistaken,she was Greek Lady Milbanke,may I introduce Lord Byron -Mr Hobhouse -How do you do? -Then Miss Milbanke -How do you do?(Unison) When did you next have contact with Lord Byron? A few weeks later I received a letter from him What did that letter say? It was a proposal of marriage And how did you regard this? An eccentricity,a joke in rather bad taste And what did you do about it? I told Lord Byron so Lord Byron,I congratulate you I hope we are both to be congratulated,Annabella I was referring to your speech in the House of Lords It had been excellently reported Are you making a career of politics? Indeed,no How very disappointing I admire a man with ambition Won't you sit down? I assume from your attitude, Miss Milbanke that you cannot have received my proposal of marriage But I did I regarded it as another of your well-known eccentricities Why? We scarcely know each other Oh come now,meeting in the park,concert dinner at Lady Jersey We were set nine places away from me Now,so you counted them,did you? I was wrong when I said that we scarcely know each other From your verses "Angel conversations" I have summed up your character very clearly And have written of it in my diary An honor indeed May I ask what you said? By all means The passions of being his guide since childhood and have exercised a tyrannical power over his intellect In one of his poems he says I love the virtues that I cannot claim Annabella marry me Please,I must think it over I am not a man to be thought over Very well then,the answer is no I see you are far too good for a fallen spirit to know,Miss Milbanke Good afternoon But at a later date you agreed to marry him -Yes -Why? Because I was in love with him Was he in love with you? I had every reason to suppose so Was he a good husband? He was a monster Just one moment You've told us that Lord Byron proposed to you and that you refused him After that refusal who made the next approach? -I did -You did? I wrote to Lord Byron You knew his affair with Lady Caroline Lamb? Yes And of those with Lady Oxford and Lady Jersey? Yes -Yet you wrote to him -Yes-Why? Because like Lady Caroline you couldn't keep away from him? Because by then I was certain that I loved him So it comes down to this You proposed to Lord Byron and he accepted you is that right? No,no certainly not I think we're wasting time Mr Defender The plain fact is that the witness of Lord Byron were married suppose we go on from there Mr Prosecutor do you wish to ask Lady Byron anything further? If you please My Lord You told us that Lord Byron was not a good husband What do you complain of in his treatment of you? -Many things -Name one of them? His cruelty Was he often cruel to you? Continuously When did this cruelty start? -On the day of our marriage -On the day of your marriage? Yes As soon as we were in our carriage on our honeymoon For nearly half an hour he sat without speaking without moving When I spoke to him George Byron Byron Miss Milbanke,we are going on our treacle moon Isn't that enough? Must we have conversation as well? Treacle moon,why do you call it that? It is regarded by the rest of the world with an affection which I find sickly and cloying They call it honeymoon I prefer treacle moon Do you object Miss Milbanke? Why do you call me by my maiden name? But it might have been better if you'd stayed a maid George,you can't mean that You should have married me when I first proposed to you It's too late now It must come to a separation,that too You mean you don't love me? No I see I admire you of course Me? Represent order sanity respectability All those things which my life lacks I esteem those qualities very highly Perhaps esteem is a better foundation for marriage Very well then I must learn to esteem you Why you learn to love me Oh,Annabella Your British sense of fair play is implacable Don't worry we'll manage somehow Good Afternoon,My Lady, Good Afternoon,My Lord Good Afternoon,Fletcher This is certainly a splendid house Can we afford it? No,but it's large,large enough for both of us to have a little privacy Well tonight we must make out our budget of expenses We shall have to live very simply Oh,Annabella you do it Mathematics bore me Someone at the door That's a bit of profound remark Our first visitor how exciting Who is it Fletcher? Bailiff,My Lord Byron,thank goodness I found you Oh my dear Augusta Come with me both of you I want to speak to you Why the mystery Augusta? Byron,I want you to make your apologies and go You've helped(?) most in for life, we've only just arrived You'd better know Caroline is back from Ireland She's coming here tonight Is that any reason why I should run away? Of course not I should like to welcome my cousin home I don't think that would be very wise She's a little mad Oh,dear Caro,how nice to see you You know,Augusta and Annabella I I want to thank you for your release(?) Such lovely,lovely letters I shall always keep them Caro,you know that I'm married to Annabella They told me but I knew they were lying That's true Don't you know about Annabella She is cold She has high principles and she studies mathematics She's purer than the driven snow And she'll drive you mad Mad,Byron Mad Lady Caroline You'll find out You all find out You'll find out -George,do I disturb you? -Damn the blame Well,what is it? These bills we seem to be overwhelmed with debt Oh those they've always been debts in our family,my pippin My poor mother died of a bill for upholstery But have we no money? Couldn't you take something for your poems I will not take money for what I write Well what use is it then? Can't you sell half the estate? I'll sell the whole lot if somebody wanted to buy it Place has been on the market for months George,we must do something This house and the bailiffs Oh,you'll get used to them George,I'm going to have a baby -Does there need to be expected -I thought Oh Annabella you think too much if only you were the less perfect I'd love you all the more George,don't drink now this is the time you should be writing A time to eat a time to sleep time to walk in the park a time to pay calls and now a time for poetry Can't you stop performing me even for one moment I'm sorry Can't you see that I'm not like other people I was born lame I was set apart for some mission in life I don't know what it is I don't know whether it's for good or evil but I do know that I'm not like other people and it's no good trying to make me so is that clear? Yes,George Then leave me alone Fletcher Where is he? Fletcher My Lord, I have the honor to inform you For your honor(?),Fletcher, where the duke is he (?) Your wife,a daughter -Fletcher -Byron You ought to be ashamed put those things away Oh,thank you doctor Dear Augusta Are you now going to be witness as well? Oh please think of your wife What else can I think of? every turn I takes she is here I've no patience with you she lies there in pain and you behave like a hooligan You'd better go to your room And write poetry I suppose it's the time for writing poetry isn't it? You mean to tell the court that while you are lying in bed giving birth to his child Lord Byron was firing his pistols in the room below? Yes And was that why you left him? No You still forgave him after that? Yes Then why did you separate from him eventually? Because the doctors pronounced him sane Perhaps you could explain a little more clearly Lady Byron His behavior was so so impossible that I thought his mind must be affected but when the doctors pronounced him quite sane then I could find no further excuse for his behavior so I left him Was there one other reason that finally decided you to leave? -Yes -What was it? -Must I answer that? -I'm afraid so,yes I discovered that misconduct had taken place between my husband and Mrs Leigh Mr Prosecutor are you proposing to call on Mrs Leigh? I am My Lord Very well you may continue I have done,My Lord Call Mrs Leigh -You're Mrs Leigh? -Yes -You're the wife of Colonel George Leigh? -I am You've heard the accusation brought against you by Lady Byron? That you and Lord Byron were lovers? Yes Is there any truth in it? None whatever You know both Lord and Lady Byron well? Yes,I've always been one of their closest friend -I believe you stay at their house? -Yes At whose invitation? Lady Byron Let's be quite clear about this It was Lady Byron who invited you to stay at Piccadilly Terrace? Yes And not Lord Byron? No Have you been there recently? Certainly,I was there when her baby was born And I was there when she went away So the Lady Byron's accusation comes as a complete surprise to you? It is more than a surprise it is extremely distressing for me We were always the greatest of friends You say that you were at Piccadilly Terrace when Lady Byron went away? Yes Do you know why she went? I only know what she and Byron have told me She thought he was mad and bad He thought she was narrow and bigoted They were,how shall I put it,incompatible Your presence had nothing to do with her leaving? On the contrary I persuaded her to stay with him on several earlier occasions I see What did you do when she did go away? I tried to comfort poor Byron of course How did you do that Mrs Leigh? I remember quite distinctly We were sitting together in the library and he seemed very upset so I said Don't you realize that any woman would leave you She'd have to She tried to own me I couldn't have that Women do you know There's nothing very strange about it You wouldn't -Dear Augusta -No I wouldn't I know you too well I have five children You were my sixth She put the pin in my hand and then She'll come back Then it will start all over again When she's here you behave like a street boy And when she's gone you pine for her When will you grow up I don't care to so leave me alone with my infantile behavior It's such a little stone Surely I merit something larger That will come my dear All in good time I hope you're right Now,look this won't do We must show ourselves to the faithful Go and change,we'll go to Lady Jersey We can't do that Oh,why not? She invited me In fact she told me the party was being given in my honor Yes,come on Augusta we'll go and change No Hopton,Mr Hopton I was addressing you Lord Byron Hopton I believe that you have already met Mrs Leigh Yes indeed at the Canaves, Good evening,Mrs Leigh Good evening,Mr Hopton My dear,you mustn't let anything upset you at all This party's in your honor Just look at all the people who come -Good evening Madame -Good evening My Lord Good evening,Fletcher Come into the library,Augusta Only for a moment -Is there anything else My Lord -Hmm,no you can go to bed,Fletcher Thank you My Lord,Good night Good night -Augusta -It's no good Byron You saw what happened tonight You'll pay no attention to that surely I do,I must and so should you Well I don't,the buzzing of insects occasionally disturbs me It does not defeat me There are some things even you can't fight You've lost Annabella You're losing your friends If I do it's their loss You really believe that don't you? You see I know you Byron I know you through and through You've been hurt too badly and too often So you want to hurt the world in return Your mother hurt you When she didn't understand the misery it was in a little boy's heart Because of her you want to hurt every other woman It's no good Byron You can't fight them all Oh,Byron Augusta Why do you suppose they behaved like that to Lord Byron? Because they hated him Why should they do that? Because they were jealous of his success People love to drag down a great man It excuses their own weakness Did it never occur to you Mrs Leigh That the people at Lady Jersey were expressing their contempt for Lord Byron's treatment of his wife? Yes,it did occur to me My Lord But it's no good expecting a poet to be like other men You can't keep an eagle in a cage on a ground A charming metaphor,Mr Prosecutor do you wish to put any questions to Mrs Leigh? Mrs Leigh,I want to ask you only one question Did Lady Byron approve of your relationship? I don't know what you mean by that All I can tell you it was Lady Byron who invited me to stay at her house I don't think she would have done that if she disapproved of me I was horrified when I heard her evidence in the court today Mr Prosecutor I think we may leave Mrs Leigh's evidence there? What this court wishes to know now is something of the other side something which can be put in Lord Byron side of the scale I think we should hear the evidence for the defense Very well,My Lord My Lord,I shall not detain the court long It would be easier for me to produce a list of fifty nay fifty thousand people who would be willing to come to this court and give evidence that Lord Byron treated them with kindness love affection generosity often at the expense of his own comfort but I will content myself by calling only two people one man and one woman who were proud to call him friend Call John Hobhouse John Hobhouse -Your name is John Cam Hobhouse -Yes You knew Byron well ? Very well Mr Hobhouse,I want to ask you one or two questions about different aspects of Byron's life what would you say was his attitude towards his fellow man I think I can illustrate that best by an instance in his political career I remember right it happened at Brooks's Club or was it Boodle's I'm not sure Anyhow we were all seated around the table Byron was full of some joke he had played on Lord North I met Lord North just now He admired my coach I told him it was a copy of Napoleon's He was very shocked No don't you shock him again Yes,I shall,this afternoon in the House of Lords Are you ready to speak? Yes,I should have something to say about this iniquitous Frame Breakers Bill You don't support these fellows,sure? Of course I do Put yourself in their place The frame breakers are hungrier because these machines have taken away their work so they smash them,wouldn't you'll do the same? -Somebody may hear you -I hope they do hear me It's high time they knew what was going on under their noses I intend to say the same in the House of Lords this afternoon only louder my fellow peers are nearly all stone deaf I have traversed the scene of war in the Peninsula I've been in some of the most oppressed provinces of Turkey and Greece but never never under the most despotic infidel governments did I behold such squalid wretchedness and I've seen since my return in the very heart of a Christian country and how will you carry this Bill into effect can you commit a whole country to its own prison? Will you erect gibbets in every field are these the remedies for a starving and desperate populace there are only two things My Lords required to implement this Bill should it become law 12 butchers for the jury and a monster for a judge -A monstrous speech -Outrageous a stab in the back for England Byron,I must congratulate you on your maiden speech I don't know when I've been so moved Oh thank you my dear Dallas,thank you You intend to take up politics? Well I always felt that the houses of Parliament were eminently suited for people with nothing better to do I have something better to do There's a great future for you there if you care to No I'm afraid it would take too long You're a young Yes I'm under 24 well then you see I'm going to die when I'm 37 And did he in fact die when he was 37? -Yes -Where? In Greece What was he doing there? Fighting to rid Greece from the Turks I suppose he was paid very well for that On the contrary He lost a considerable part of his personal fortune in aiding the patriots Then it would be true to say that he lost his life and fortune while fighting for the weak and the oppressed? -It would indeed -Thank You Mr Hobhouse You know something of poetry? Well,a little In your opinion was Lord Byron a good poet? Yes On what do you base that opinion? On his poetry Did others take the same view? Everybody who could read,yes Was Lord Byron a successful poet? One of the most successful in the world Right from the beginning people fought to buy every volume when it was published On the day the Childe Harold came out He went to sleep unknown, and woke to find himself famous Fletcher,Fletcher,never here when I want him Your Lordship? Fletcher,I hear noises, what the devil is it? It's people My Lord Wherever you look those people How abominably true What do they want,money again? No,My Lord, it's about your book I never saw so many carriages My book? Who's out there? It's Mr Hobhouse My Lord and Mr Murray and 20 others and cards and messages Murray? Ah,shall we keep them waiting,hey Fletcher? Oh,please see them My Lord, they'll burst in I swear it You're a scoundrel,Fletcher Did they bribe you to disturb me? No My Lord I do it in the way of duty and at times it isn't pleasant Don't be impertinent,Fletcher Now go out there hold them off for one whole minute Then a bit of Mr Hobhouse,Mr Murray Nobody else,you understand? Well I'll try,My Lord His Lordships compliments he'd be obliged to see Mr Hobhouse and Mr Murray alone for a few moments Mr Hobhouse and Mr Murray Good morning gentlemen Well can you tell me what all this racket is about? Why? Childe Harold of course Oh come,come ,come I told you it would be a success Never anything like it,My Lord 12,000 copies sold out this morning And the bookstores are still being stored by coach They've had to put up barricades Childe Harold? Worst thing I ever wrote Half London is outside ready to meet you They idolize you already They could hate me just as easily One day perhaps they will Gentlemen thank you for bringing me this news I'm deeply touched by your concern Good morning Does he always behave like that? Not always only when somebody's watching him And now Mr Hobhouse one thing more We've heard a great deal about Lord Byron's behavior with women My friend can produce a list of 50 women who all claim to have been wronged by him Can you tell us of any one woman Who loved him and might still be able to speak well of him? I could tell you of several One is all I ask Very well,Teresa Guiccioli And where did Lord Byron meet her? In Venice after his wife had left him He had sold his estate and used it and gone to live abroad He'd been way from England about three years when I went to visit him He's so magnificent and so rich and so wicked Perhaps you also are an Englishman or Signor No,no I'm not So pity,myself I would like to live in the Palazzo Mocenigo And to be a Mi Lord inglese I would have been so wicked Yes I have no doubt of that Perhaps for the moment it might be better if we concentrated on getting to the Palazzo Which one is it? There are three of the Palazzo Mocenigo and he live in the most big such,faccia,Mi Lord -Benvenuto Signore -Good afternoon Thank you Mr Hobhouse,Sir,his Lordship didn't tell me that you were in Venice I doubt he remember it himself -Where is he? -Upstairs,Sir Working Allow me to show you the way Fletcher,Fletcher,what on earth are all these animals doing here? His Lordship just took a fancy to them,that's all This way,Sir,and mind the goose on the stairs Very ferocious You know,if you ask me they're the ones that ought to be in their cages His Lordships in here,Sir Never been to bed all night Mr Hobhouse is here,My Lord -Oh -Mr Hobhouse My dear John good to see you It's been a long time -Too long -Yes Three years You've changed you know You look so much older You look just the same That's what I wanted you to say Even if it isn't true Well,what brings you out here? I've come on a mission What mission John? To save me for my new friend? No To restore you to your old ones Come back to England with me you've been away too long No,if I can't be with my wife and child Then I prefer to stay where I am She still refuses to see you? I've giving up asking Tell me,what do they say about me in London? Beppo is good,Manfred is better and Childe Harold is the best and wickedest poem you ever written Well,in short you are the greatest poet since Shakespeare Is that all? Well,there is other talk Particularly when Lady Caroline Lamb is present she seems to be the authority for your,Venetian night's entertainment Yes,I don't doubt it It must be great fun for them the bad Lord Byron Poet of darkness,evil on himself I play the part very well especially when the tourists watching It's one way to forget Well,so long as you're happy Of course I'm not happy I've known moments of such misery That I nearly put a bullet through my head and then I remember what pleasure that will give my mother-in-law so I go and get drunk instead -Well -It's time to dress,My Lord I put Mr Hobhouse in the Blue Room My dear,John Entirely to your own in Venice aren't you enjoying yourself? Oh,it's might be worth, the wine is excellent The women are beautiful and husband's most attentive Oh those aren't the husbands not the men standing behind the chairs These are the husband's playing cards But who are the men standing behind the chairs? Well they're known as the Cavalieri serventi What exactly does that mean? The literal translations is accredited Cavalier You mean the husbands in here while they Yeah it's amazing Appears to be one lady whose Cavalier has not yet arrived Yes,John I'm going to make an experiment What kind of experiments? An experiments in politeness, it'll probably be the death of me But if it is my gondolier will see you home Scuzati, nominal Safari come elegance But you did it very well for a beginner I was wondering when you would And what happened then? Well I went home and went to bed And Lord Byron and the Contessa what happened to them? I think you should ask them that Thank you Mr Hobhouse,I will Call the Contessa Guiccioli Contessa Guiccioli Your full name Teresa Guiccioli Mr Hobhouse has just told us of your first meeting with Lord Byron Do you mind if I ask you to recall what happened afterward? No,why should I? It is always in my thoughts and it is not the thing one would wish ever to forget Later the same evening I slipped away from the house and went to meet Byron I didn't think you really would come I had to it was necessary for me to know whether you understood You know what you're doing I think so For you You're stranger here in Venice I've been here three years We have many customs which are not the same as those of other countries Tonight you gave me my shawl and fan Do you know what that means? In Venice I think so Tell me please It means it was accepted That I become your cavalieri servente What do you call that in England? We've many names for it Your devoted admirer,humble servant and faithful lover Do you wish to be any of those things? All of them I think you just still don't understand completely with us taking a Cavalier servente It's not something to be done lightly -It is a serious thing -Not too serious I hope With me,yes When I love it is for always But your husband? That is different How different? I am 19 my husband is 60 The marriage is arranged by our family since I'm a little baby He is polite and kind to me That is all You don't love him Only as one would love one's grandfather Do you think you could love me? -You know who I am -Yes,I know And are prepared to accept it? I think so I warn you I should find very little to justify such faith You mean you do not wish to love me? Oh but I do love you You must have joked with me I'm an Italian woman I could die of love And I can die of enlighted So, we'll go no more a roving So late into the night, Though the heart be still as loving, And the moon be still as bright. For the sword outwears its sheath, And the soul wears out the breast, And the heart must pause to breathe, And love itself have rest. Though the night was made for loving, And the day returns too soon, Yet we'll go no more a roving By the light of the moon. Though the night was made for loving, And the day returns too soon, -Yet we'll go no more a rovving -No,no not rovvin,roving But that doesn't rhyme,tesoro mio It is not loving Well for that you must blame the English language,not me But,oh Pietro This is my brother Pietro Gamba -You're hurt -It is nothing Pietro,you promised me you wouldn't fight again All the time he's fighting all the time is being hurt -You must have many enemies -Any man who loves freedom -has many enemies -And you love freedom -Enough to fight for it -Yes Have you never heard of the Carbonari?

Yes,they want to drive out the Austrians But they will never succeed Well,whether they succeed or not I admire you very much We are all Carbonari the whole family aren't we,Teresa? The Austrians do not appear much here in Venice Because they do not need There are many traitors to do their work for them But they tell me in Ravenna many Austrians And there is fighting To Italy and freedom Yes To Italy and freedom If I tell you England wants you back Then I shouldn't believe you England likes her poets respectable The trouble with you is you can't make up your mind Between the two Byrons Two Byrons? Byron the lover,the romantic legend and Byron the poet You're far too bright a flame to be extinguished by a woman's fan Used to be a third Byron You seem to forget him He used to have a conscience of something to rise him Do you remember? He admired the French revolution Hated injustice,Napoleon was one of his heroes He refused to admit he was lame so he taught himself to ride,shoot Yes,it was a third Byron once Bring all three back to England and the fourth and the fifth if you have them Do you think they've forgotten about Annabella -Yes -Hm She forgotten Don't know She won't come back to me Well you know that better than I Oh,she won't come back I will Yes I'll do it just to see Piccadilly again Watch the dawn breaking over Parker Square Smell the fog coming up the Thames I've I've missed England Pietro what can I do for you?

Now I do not mind dying If I have you with me here again If you die I die also -You will find somebody -No,Teresa You are my last and my only love I think you're being kind I never pretend,it is the truth It is the truth -I swear it -Amore mio And in a few months you were fully recovered But of course,all I needed was my Byron He was better than all the doctors And while you were at Ravenna did Lord Byron continue with his work for the liberation of Italy? Oh,yes all the time he and my brother are working and talking and fighting This time the Carbonari must not fail So far we've all talked a great deal by our words at least we freed Italy time and time again But the Austrians are still here and now we must make good our word Tell them to spread out as we planned and get ready for the attack Presto andate en il bosco atandete il orden de attaco I've never disliked the full moon more than now You sure the Austrian reinforcements have not yet arrived? -It's alright they come tomorrow -Good I shall be glad when it is all over I've got the most terrible indigestion Count Gamba A little magnesium ,My Lord What the devil are you doing here,Fletcher?

He should not be here Suppose the police come Let me deal with them but first let's deal with him Quickly,take him to that room there Fletcher,don't open that door until I tell you Very good My Lord Now let's all prepare to receive them In Namen des Kaisers In the name of the Emperor Vorwarts You're disturbing his Lordship "They were alone but not alone as they who shut in chambers think it loneliness the silent ocean and the starlit bay The twilight glow, which momently grew less, The voiceless sands, and dropping caves that lay" Love on the Island(Don Juan)Byron Standard genaedighe Soldate Soni state attacate nella pinita Dove il Giovanni Pietro Gamba? Perdonate me,non capisco You are English,Lord Byron Yes,I am -Do you speak English? -A little -Good -So I also speak English -Good Then maybe you'll explain to your friends what I say Since they do not understand when I speak Italian -I'll try -In this house was a man,a carbonaro He's wounded,please take me to him -There's nobody here -You'll forgive me,Contessa That's stain on that your robe,whats that? -Blood -Exactly Earlier this evening I had an accident in my scissors I think you're not the only one who's had an accident this evening With your permission I'll now search the house Lambert,Stein kommt mit Mir You will please come away from that door My Lord Byron,this is a very foolish interference It may interest you to know that by dint of long practice I'm able to hit small coins at 20 paces soldiers at 50 I must ask you not to interfere with a proper course of the law You seem to forget your law does not concern me I am an Englishman and an Englishman's home is his castle I think you rely too much on the fact that you're an Englishman I have never yet found it to disadvantage now will you please go Very well I go but I shall return then My Lord it would be well if you are not here After that the authorities ordered your removal to Genoa,did they not? Yes And it was whilst you were at Genoa that Lord Byron became interested in the liberation of Greece Yes You were not very happy about that were you? No Did you ask him not to go? But of course,constantly -You are late tonight,amore mio -Yes -You were talking affairs? -Yes -The Greek Committee -I hope they go back to Greece very soon When then,I follow them Well you can't Dearest Teresa,you cried last night and the night before It isn't the crying so much There's the monotony of it Which I find quite unbearable You must remember the tantrums mean nothing whatever to me I was brought up in the hard school of Caroline Lamb I shall not cry I promise you At least not while you are here Must you really go? Yes,it isn't that I want to leave you,Teresa It isn't even something that I can decide for myself This was foreordained You know you will never speak of my lameness No,I never noticed it I never forget it Oh,Byron Part of my whole life You'll never know Nobody will ever know How much it's affected everything that's happened to me Always it made me feel that I was meant to different from other men Set aside for some special purpose Perhaps this is it Perhaps I shall never find I don't really know We sail on Wednesday I must write a reply -Look after him,Fletcher -I will My Lady Don't let him drink too much brandy No,My Lady -And see all his ? -Yes,My Lady And always change his clothes quickly -Then he'll be all right -Yes,My Lady Stop plotting behind my back,Fletcher and take that letter Have you ever read this book by Madame de Stahl? No I think you should "Dearest Teresa I have read this book in your garden;my love you were absent, or else I could not have read it You"(may) "will not understand these English words and others will not "understand them" which is the reason" (from not writing them)" I have not scrawled them" in Italian but you will recognize But you will recognize the handwriting of him who passionately loved you and you will divine that, over a book which was yours, he could only think of love (will you try do the same), "when the Alps and the ocean divide us, but they never will, unless you wish it" Lord Byron Letter To The Countess Teresa Guiccioli Do you wish it? Strange how it so much to say I can't think of anything You can save all the words for the next time I see you When you come back When I come back There is no use of it Neither of us believes that No But I shall always have you with me in here and I shall ? you when I first saw you A little Grey now But still ruff My dear I feel the proudest woman in the world This will be good bye Yes Goodbye,Teresa It's cold suddenly Then he turned away and walked to his carriage and I never saw him again But it is as though he never left my side Because he's never left my heart If you told me he had committed a thousand things I would still reply But for me he is the greatest man who ever lived Because he's the only man I ever loved And now ladies and gentlemen of the jury You have heard the evidence And it is for you to decide what the verdict will be Do you believe in Caroline Lambs bad Lord Byron or Teresa Guiccioli's good one Is he to be remembered by posterity as a poet and a liberator or as a seducer and a libertine It is for you to say Subtitles by Nostromo
