Hello. Hi, is that Sarah? Speaking. Hey, Sarah, it's Lyttanya here. In 1960s and '70s Britain, hundreds of Black children were caught up in an extraordinary scandal. They were labeled as educationally subnormal by the state and wrongly sent to schools for children deemed to have low intelligence, a decision that would have a devastating impact on their lives. In Greater London in particular, a very high proportion of British-born Black kids are in schools for the educationally subnormal, and nobody can fully explain why. Yes, so can I ask, would you be willing to talk about this on camera? Very few former pupils have ever spoken publicly about what happened to them. I understand. Hi, this is Lyttanya... I'm making a documentary about... I... I don't know if I can deal with people, with me being on TV. I mean, I haven't even told my wife that I, you know, I went to a special school. In one conversation I was permitted to record, I gained some insight as to what might be holding people back. Do you mind me asking you why you don't think...? Well, first, I mean, you know, you don't want people to know and, in those days, words were used, like you're slow or you're backward, and it was quite painful, you know. But now, for the first time, some of those who lived through it are willing to speak out. You do feel trapped and you feel very small. Yeah, it makes you feel inferior. Having those labels put on you year after year, you become that person. Those who first exposed what was happening reveal how they fought the injustice. The disproportionate number of Black children who were sent to those schools was really quite scandalous. I was shocked, but the reaction of the establishment was very interesting. They said it's all rubbish, it's all lies. This is a story that exposed assumptions at the heart of the British school system that has an enduring legacy today. One of the places in which battles over race and racism are fought out, it's still schools. We are building a time bomb for ourselves, and one that's going to blow the whole bloody place apart. From 1945 in Britain, children thought to have limited intellectual ability were to be described by a new term. Stigmatizing, yet official, that term was "educationally subnormal." Noel is one of the few who is willing to speak publicly about his experience of being categorized this way. My name is Noel Gordon. My parents were living in Jamaica, but they came here for independence. They came 1960 and I came '61. So they were called over to work and they came with British passports. Fifty-four-year-old Noel lives in North London. During the 1970s, he believes he was wrongly sent to a school for the so-called educationally subnormal. My son says to me, "You've got a lot, haven't you? How long you been?" I said, "Well, I did a lot of studying when I was younger." I had to do it because I needed to get a decent job. Today, he has 13 separate qualifications, including a post-graduate certificate in education. I suppose I'm proud of them because I was told that I was stupid. You see, I was told I was dunce. So it was hard going to school and all that. They call them special schools now, but it was... We didn't have proper lessons, that's why I can't spell today. Leaving school without any qualifications is one thing, right, but leaving school and thinking you're stupid, it's a difficult ball game all together because it knocks your confidence. You haven't got no confidence. Noel is a self-published author who runs voluntary workshops to inspire young children. It turns out I actually like education. I think there was a candle, a little flame burning inside me, saying that, you know, stuff you lot, you know. When I get out of college, that's where I'm going to learn. We developed this resilience because we know how messed up the system is. So why were children like Noel being defined as educationally subnormal? The story starts in the '60s, when people from the West Indies arrived in their greatest numbers. What do you know about England? I know England is the mother of this country. I feel that anytime we go to England, we should be well treated, like when they come here, we treat them right. My own grandparents arrived from the Caribbean in the '50s. With unemployment running high in their native Jamaica, they were glad to find work here as factory workers. There's been a big demand for their labor in the industrial areas of the Midlands and the North and the South East. Despite the difficulties faced by this first wave of immigrants, they were still optimistic that their children, being born and educated here, would have a brighter future. Generally speaking, Caribbean parents saw education and schooling as a route to social mobility. We came here not to make loads of money, but to ensure that our children could get a better start in life. But for immigrant children, this promise of an equal chance to a decent education was soon at risk. Schools began to take in more and more colored children. White parents complained their children were being held back. It was actually white parents in Southall who objected to too many immigrant children in the schools that were interfering with the education of their children, which was not true of course. Professor Sally Tomlinson has spent her career focusing on issues concerning race, ethnicity and education. The Department for Education decided that schools should have no more than 30% of immigrant children. To make sure that quota wasn't broken, the government suggested spreading the concentration of Black and Asian children around different schools. We ought to disperse. You see, the alternative to this is a growing number of schools with almost a hundred percent immigrant children in them. Now, I don't believe that any one committee, certainly not the teachers, wants to see this happen. Socially and educationally, it's completely undesirable. From 1965, 11 local authorities nationwide adopted government recommendations to disperse. It became known as bussing, with many traveling for miles to their new schools. But bus children were often separated at the schools they were taken to. This makes everybody involved in the educational world very color conscious. Because first of all, the parents and the children themselves are aware that they are being treated differently on the basis of color. It had an impact in terms of self-image and self-esteem because if you're being sent to a school outside of your area for no other reason than that you are Black or Asian and if you stayed where you should be, you would impact the learning of other children, then it tells you something about yourself. But bussing wasn't an isolated attempt to remove Black children from settings where they were deemed to be a problem. The story behind Noel's placement in a school for the educationally subnormal suggests there were many ways in which this could happen. I must have been about five, six, maybe. And I went to hospital because I had a problem with my teeth and my mum took me there and they said, "We're going to take them all out." Because they were baby teeth. Noel was given a general anesthetic. On coming round, he realized something was wrong. I woke up in a bed and there was four doctors holding me down. I had a drip in my arm. And I see this like a yellow film covering my eyes. It's like a shutter come down. Noel had undiagnosed sickle cell anemia and the anesthetic had triggered a serious reaction. He says his parents were advised that he should be sent to a state-funded boarding school, where his newly found medical needs could be taken care of. They said they've got to take care for me for the rest of my life, whatever it cost. So, somebody came to see my mum at home and told her that they've got a school for me to go to. "We've got to send him to a school with a matron who will take care of him when he's sick and take care of his education." Noel noticed that his classmates had other conditions that fell outside physical illnesses like his. When I started that special school, I was about six. And I went down to my first class, they showed me where the class was and I went in there and then all I hear is, "Oi, nigger!" This is what this boy said and she goes, "Sit down, sit down, sit down". It turns out he had some proper learning difficulties. ♪ The sun has gone to bed ♪ Noel says his father hadn't realized that the school catered specifically for children with learning difficulties and disabilities. Using the accepted terminology of the time, Noel's father sought clarification. My dad says to the headmaster, "This is a school for handicapped children." The headmaster said, "Yeah, but we don't like to use that word. We call them slow learners." At that point, my dad realized that, what sort of school it was, because they never told him before. But there was nothing, his hands were tied. He couldn't do nothing. He had to go by what the system says. For six-year-old Noel, what should have been a routine dental procedure had a devastating impact on the rest of his life. He says no evidence of him having a learning disability was ever presented to his parents. The questionable reasons given for his placement at a special school mirror a far wider picture. In inner London in 1967, the proportion of immigrant children in schools for the educationally subnormal was almost double the proportion of those in mainstream schools, with the majority of these children being West Indian. The subject that provokes most controversy and causes the most bitter verbal exchanges between Black and white is the education and thus the whole future of the Black British. Now, special schools were a bit of a euphemism which many Black parents didn't understand. They thought, "If my child has had a test and that test has resulted in them going to a special school, then it means they must be going to get a higher level of education." In the early 1960s, Eric Huntley was a trade unionist in the postal service and had two young children. Can I, can I have a glass of water? He also remembers that the truth about special schools was often left unexplained. We thought, "Wow, we've come to England and they're sending our children to special schools, we are very lucky." Until such time as they realized that they weren't special schools in the sense of better schools, they were schools for the educationally subnormal, and that was really a shock to their system. The term "educationally subnormal" first appeared as part of the 1944 Education Act. It described children who were thought to have innately low intelligence and needed some form of specialized education. When you actually think about it, the idea of labeling a child as subnormal must be one of the biggest insults that you could ever, you know, deliver to a child. But a lot of people really thought that ESN schools were good places, you know, where children could be taught according to their levels of ability and they had smaller classes, they did have perhaps more suitable learning resources, you know. Yet the category of educational subnormality covered a wide range of needs. Is it easy for you to define ESN, educationally subnormal for us? Not very easy at all, really. Um, if I have 140 youngsters in school, there are 140 different reasons why they've needed special education, and this may vary from very clear, distinct brain damage to environmental factors. Some ESN schools had examples of good teaching, but they were also criticized for failing to provide for the specific needs and strengths of their pupils. For Noel, being taught in such an environment had long-lasting effects. People who live ESN schools, right, we get bullied throughout life because we don't know the norms, we don't know how things work, so how the hell am I going to cope in a society like this? Yeah, it makes you feel inferior. Having those labels put on you year after year, you become that person. With the term "special" often used in place of the term "educationally subnormal," many Caribbean parents were initially unaware of how their children were being identified. Noel wanted to hear from his mum what she understood to be happening at the time. So, Mum, how are you feeling today? - Hey? - How are you feeling today? Oh, not too bad. I get confused, you're 93 or 94? I will be 94 the 31st day of May coming. Next year, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Can you remember how I ended up in that school? Yes. Because I was too young to remember why. I think I was six and a half. He said that they're going to put you in this special school where teachers and doctors are. If you take down ill, they can see you go right. - Okay, but he never... - I remember that. But he never told you what type of school it was? No. What kind of education did you think I would get? Good education that you can do what you want to do. Yes, yes, I see. - That's what we were looking for. - Yes. The education is the most essential thing parents can give to children. Yes, I see. So, did you think they lied to you? Did you feel disappointed? Yes. They disappoint me and your dad. Your dad died with that in his heart. Like so many immigrant parents, Noel's mum initially trusted the British education system, but others were starting to ask more questions. In the mid-1960s, Bernard Coard, a 22-year-old master student, arrived in the UK. From before I left Grenada, I had made up my mind that I wanted a British University education and I knew in advance I would have no money, which I didn't, so I had to get a job in order to continue my education and, in that regard, I saw a newspaper advert for a job as a youth leader. - Oh, no. - Oh, no. Bernard worked in a deprived area of South East London. Some of those youths, a number of them, but by no means a majority, came from seven schools that were described to me as ESN schools. When I was told that there were schools for the educationally subnormal, called ESN schools, my immediate reaction was, "What? What are you talking about?" I'd never heard about this thing before. And it didn't take long for Bernard to spot a distinct trend. I noted ESN schools had a higher percentage of Black kids than I considered normal given the demographics of the boroughs from which they came, and also I saw too many kids that were clearly average intelligence or even above average. And Bernard's concerns weren't unusual. Caribbean parents were encountering strange attitudes across the system. The concept that there were children who could only learn very little and there was no place for them in society other than the most menial manual labor, that horrified me. Parents would share stories about the kinds of difficulties they were having with schools, either in terms of the attitudes of teachers to their children and the children's ability to learn, or that headteachers were saying to them that they should abandon any notion of their child being able to become a doctor or a lawyer or whatever else because there is no way those children would actually be able to achieve those sorts of things. In 1968 in the North London Borough of Haringey, a leaked council report written by Alderman Doulton, a local headteacher, fell into the hands of Black parents. It stated that there was a general recognition that the IQs of West Indian immigrants worked out below their English contemporaries. It's shocking that a local authority with statutory responsibility for making education provision for Black children could actually be saying those things. It was where there was absolute concrete proof that something was going wrong. They'd seen their children going to school having poor experiences, not achieving and this didn't sit well with Black Caribbean parents. For an increasing number of them, an urgent question now presented itself. Why were their children so frequently being treated as if they were less intelligent? Gus John believed the answer had far deeper roots than just discrimination in the classroom. Education and schooling sat along a spectrum with a whole number of other racisms that we were subjected to. The problem is that there were many, many academics who were equating race with lack of intellectual ability. The reason for Black underachievement was that those children were Black. Good evening, our main guest tonight is Professor Eysenck, who believes that far and away the greatest influence on our intelligence is heredity, it's fixed at birth and it's a great mistake to think that by education, for instance, you can do much to raise the intelligence of those born stupid. Hans Eysenck, a former professor at the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London, was one of the key figures in the controversies over race and intelligence. We give the same kind of education using the same methods with bright and dull children. This is not fair to either. Eysenck's belief that genetics plays a role in influencing intelligence was not hugely disputed. More problematic, however, was his theory that entire racial groups might be genetically condemned to lower intelligence. It led to people believing that Black children were not as capable of academic success as white children. Eysenck cited an American study that seemed to show that the IQ of Black children fell on average 12 points below white children. It was a theory that seemed to make the disproportionate number of Black children in schools for the educationally subnormal not a scandal, but a justifiable practice. When people like Eysenck wrote about race and intelligence, what they were actually doing was justifying all those tropes that had been floating around the place throughout the period of enslavement where people believed that, you know, not only were Black people sub-human and the rest of it, but they can't be expected to perform or to be as intelligent as white people. But how did these ideas about race and intelligence find their way into the British school system? The answer lies in a post-war obsession with intelligence testing. Black children entering British schools in the 1960s entered a maelstrom of new ideas about education and one of the strong influences of that time was the cult, and I would call it a cult, of IQ, of IQ-ism. IQ tests were one of the key methods used to determine which children were sent to schools for the so-called educationally subnormal. The child had to be seen by a psychologist who administered IQ tests, you know, and if you were at the lower end, you were supposed to be remedial, dull, you were going to be stuck into an ESN school. The average IQ range is considered to be between 90 and 110, yet one survey from 1967 found that in one set of tests newly arrived immigrants scored an average of 76. Black Caribbean children were particularly caught up in the idea that their failure in British schools was somehow due to this magical property called IQ. On the surface, this statistic appeared to confirm the most controversial theory about race and intelligence advanced by figures like Eysenck. But there were other professionals who had started to suspect that the results of these IQ tests weren't always as clear-cut as they seemed. - Oh, hello, Lyttanya. - Hey, Waveney. - Nice to see you. - How are you? I'm all right, thank you, and you? - Can I come in? - Yes, please do. Waveney Bushell was one of the UK's first Black educational psychologists and worked as one for 40 years. She also administered IQ tests. You know when these children were taking the tests, what were their reactions? The children didn't know what this, what the tests were, particularly those who came from the West Indies. Well, the test was thought to represent the true intelligence of the child, but these tests were clearly made up not to test children from different cultures. It meant that one was comparing, I would say, apples with lemons. Using both workbooks and props like these little white dolls, children were asked to fulfil tasks that supposedly didn't require special knowledge. This question, for example, asks the child to fill in details on a deliberately incomplete drawing of a person, adding the missing leg, arm or eye. Other parts of the test, however, relied on more culturally specific knowledge favoring children who had grown up here. When I used to test the children, one found that children didn't understand the words that were asked of them. For example, when children were asked, "What's a tap?" they couldn't describe it, they couldn't define it. I felt he must be able to say this, to say what this is. It's something that is used in the West Indies. It must have a name. In fact, there was no reason why West Indian children should have known what the word "tap" means, because in parts of the Caribbean, a tap was known as a pipe. Fortunately, there was a tap in the very room in which I was testing, and I walked across the room and I said, "Well, what is this?" And the child said, "A pipe." They knew what a pipe was, which was the same concept. That meant that on tests, they were made to feel inferior when they realized that many of the items that were asked of them, they could not clearly define. The low results scored by Black children in these tests meant many were wrongly sent to ESN schools. I became appalled. I asked myself this question, is this service set up to help children? I tried all sorts of ways to look at the child's intellect. With me, intelligence testing was not merely giving a test. It meant much more than that. The tests often justified assumptions that Caribbean children used deficient language indicative of their low intelligence. South Asian children were treated differently. When Asian children spoke Punjabi or spoke Guajarati, schools may have regarded that as undesirable or problematic, but they understood that Asian children had English as a second language. Very often, when Black Caribbean children used patois or creole, it wasn't regarded as a language. It was an important distinction which meant Asian children were given special help to bring them up to speed, but Caribbean children, assumed to be speaking inferior English, were initially given no extra assistance. In the West Indian islands, they speak a kind of English and the English in the schools is quite different. This has not been recognized. It wasn't at all to start with, that they had a special learning problem. They thought that their inability to speak the Queen's English, as they used to call it, was because they were thick and unintelligent, as distinct from the fact that they were speaking a different language. Cultural bias and language misunderstandings go a long way to explaining why the IQ scores of newly arrived immigrant children seemed so low. And in fact, one study showed that after Black children had a chance to become acclimatized to Britain, their IQs fell within the same average range as their white peers. It also concluded that differences in IQ results between populations were primarily the result of educational environment and not brain potential dictated by factors like race. But it wasn't just language differences that were leading to low test results for children from Caribbean backgrounds. Maisie Barratt was born in Birmingham. She believes that she was wrongly placed in a school for the so-called educationally subnormal a year after starting primary school. When I started school, I was five years old. As we got older, I'd open the book and it would just be black lines on white paper just moving about, when other children my age could actually read the book. So, I would get told off for being fidgeting. I would get my ears pulled because I'm moving about. Or I might just fall asleep, literally because I was so bored because I didn't understand. It wasn't called dyslexia in those days. It was called word blindness, blindness. Maisie believes her dyslexia made her stand out. I was called to the headmistress' office and she gave me some instructions. She said to me, "Get up, open the door and go downstairs and come back," and that is what I did, and I remember her telling my mother that I need special support because I was backward. All of a sudden, I was in this other school. And it was different. It was different. When Maisie was placed in a school for the educationally subnormal in the mid-'60s, evidence suggests other dyslexic children were also being labeled this way. Although the condition was not widely recognized at the time, data published in the 1968 report gave dyslexia as a reason for the wrongful placement of immigrant children in ESN schools. So, I wasn't being taught how to learn, how to use my brain. I just thought it was normal that the white children in the corner would get more support than us Black children. Maisie also recalls being asked to do things that fell outside what was normally expected of a pupil. When I was about 12 1/2 years old, I remember in one of the special schools I went to, I was asked to help to give the children a wash. I remember my teacher telling me that would make a very good nurse. How much is that? - Forty-one bits. - Right? But Maisie recalls that, eventually, her mother found a Black social worker who was able to help. She invited us to her office, and she gave me an assessment. I had to do a lot of puzzles, and she asked me a lot of questions, I had to do a lot of activities. And she concluded that I was an intelligent child. After almost seven years in ESN schools, an educational psychologist agreed that Maisie should return to mainstream education. But she never truly caught up. As an adult, education became a priority. So, I would do anything. I did law. I did Japanese. I did "A" -level English, even though I didn't have a GSE in English. I just wanted to be there 'cause I just wanted to take in the information. Maisie eventually studied for a degree in Caribbean studies and creative writing, and is currently writing her third book. But being labeled educationally subnormal has left her with low confidence, and she's struggled to find a lasting career. I've spent most of my time at these courses when I should have been with my children. I could have been working and making money. I did not have to be sent to a special school. I'm hoping that one day, I will be successful. I haven't given up on my dreams. The ease with which Maisie reports being written off by her teachers wasn't unusual. Professor Sally Tomlinson undertook PhD studies in schools for the educationally subnormal and observed a culture of low expectations towards Black pupils. I've got some of the transcripts that I wrote 46 years ago. This is the head teacher of the ESN school. "Hainsworth is a ghetto. It's an enclosure of people held together by fear, jealousy, and hate. Oh, dear, but it's also got problems of poverty, race and handicap. Fifty percent of the children are Black. It's sufficient to say that the behavior they exhibited made them uncontrollable in ordinary schools irrespective of their IQ." The-the comments made particularly on Black children are-are really disgraceful, you know. They have learning process which is slower, poor concentration, dialect language problems, not keen on education, volatile, boisterous, extravert, aggressive, troublesome, family problems." This stereotype spoke to one of the most prominent reasons for pupils being sent to schools for the educationally subnormal. Alongside poor results in IQ tests, it was cited again and again. - Bad behavior. - Poor behavior. - Poorly disciplined. - Bad behavior. One of these stereotypes that attached itself and still attaches itself to Black Caribbean children was that they were aggressive and had behavioral problems, and that they challenged teachers. Anne-Marie Simpson was one of those labelled as a bad child. I was born in Jamaica, in St. Elizabeth, and was raised by my grandmother up until the age of 9 years old. In fact, I was 9 1/2 when I came to England. When Anne-Marie was 9 months old, her parents migrated to England, leaving their daughter to live in Jamaica with her grandmother... a common scenario for many children. The area that I was raised in was very rural. The best way for commuting was donkeys. It was difficult getting to school. At the age of 9, Anne-Marie was flown to England to join the rest of the family. Can you just tell me about the journey of getting here? Compared to my dreaming about how it was going to be, meeting my mum, my dad, and my sisters, the fairytale was shattered. Uh, it was the total opposite. It was cold, damp. The person who I came to as my mother, we just didn't... we didn't have a relationship. It broke my heart, to be honest. I wanted to go back to my gran. So, yes: Lost, lonely, disappointed. With little formal education, Anne-Marie soon found herself struggling at school. As I got older, I realized that I couldn't keep up with my peers, and it became difficult for me then. Well, I was excluded from that school because I used to get myself into fights and subsequently ended up in a special needs school. As an adult, Anne-Marie has had a successful career as a social worker, helping people with special educational needs. She now recognizes that what was perceived by her teachers as simply bad behavior had a far more complex cause. The reason why I may be frustrated or having problems or troublesome... I couldn't read and write. But no one's never thought of, "Well, hang on, Anne-Marie has missed out so many learning years, she would be struggling." But who was in my corner? Things wasn't workin' out between myself and my mum, or my siblings, to be honest, because I-I had no friends. Can they stop the camera, please? 'Cause I'm gonna cry. - Anne-Marie. - Yes? What made you just start to cry? Um, it's bringing me back... all the memories that I kind of buried, really. And, um... I kind of buried those memories when I left home... and vowed that... I would never let my kids go through what I've gone through. And I would help them to get the best... that a parent could give their children. A 1970s study of 850 teachers confirmed that West Indian children were perceived as being aggressive and creating discipline problems. These generalizations were severely damaging the lives of Black children... and for their parents, staying quiet was no longer an option. Increasing numbers of Black parents, Black teachers, community workers, activists, began to think that something is going wrong here. Something is amiss. Bernard Coard was by now a teacher in an ESN school and realized he wasn't the only person to have spotted that Black children were being routinely wrongly placed. A few times a year-- two, maybe three times a year... I would go to this party. So, I was there with my wife, and we were on the dancefloor, dancing, and one guy comes over to me and he says, "Hey, I hear you're a teacher at one of these schools." I-I say, "Yes." He says, "Well, my kids ain't learnin' anything, and other people are complaining, other parents, and so, so, what's happening?" And he started me in a conversation. Well, once the others heard that, them come over too. Those that were dancing abandoned dancing and come over and join the conversation. And within 15 minutes, the party mash up. And at the end of all of this discussion, which must have gone on for at least two hours or more, several of them said, "We have an organization we formed just two months ago called Caribbean..." Caribbean Education and Community Workers Association, CECWA, and we decided that we should have a conference. I said whatever research you have to do, but you have to do this paper, so I did. I went to London University Institute of Education library, and I would be there until nine in the night, and whatever the closing hour, they kicked me out. I knew I wanted to find everything they had on teacher expectations, everything they had on self-image. I wanted everything on a range of different topics that I had experienced in the schools, and in the youth clubs too, that the children had as deficits imposed upon them by the system. Bernard's research was given a major boost when a chance conversation led to a significant discovery. People are now discussing the matter with a cousin of mine. She had this friend, Inner London Education Authority, or ILEA... who gave her an internal report, and she said, "This is a scandal. It needs to be exposed." The leaked report from the ILEA contained a multitude of damning admissions. It revealed that the education authority was well aware that Caribbean children were being wrongly placed in ESN schools at much higher rates than their white peers. The implied reason: not a lack of intellectual ability, but the fact that they were thought to be culturally deprived and emotionally disturbed. Armed with this evidence, Coard delivered his speech at the CECWA Conference. The response was electric. I noticed the-the wide-open eyes. Was-was really quite scandalous. The body language was quite shocked. Perplexed. Angry. The silence. There was an initial hush when some of the data was revealed. It was extremely revealing. I mean, the statistics that they gave of the rate at which Black children were being sent to these schools was-was pretty shocking. He was able to provide comprehensive details that it was a systematic approach towards the education of Black children. And at the end of it, just about everybody there said to me, "You have to turn it into a book! We don't have time to waste. You have to start it now. You have three months." The title of Coard's book boldly announced his argument. How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal. - "Educationally subnormal." - "Educationally subnormal." How the West Indian Child is Made Educationally Subnormal in the British School System. And that really did have an effect. That really woke people up. In just 50 pages, Coard forensically dismantled the entire system that had led to the ESN scandal. He exposed the institutional assumption that West Indian children were innately less intelligent than white children and that teachers were mistaking the trauma caused by immigration for a lack of intelligence. [Bernard Coard] Black kid is four times more likely to be wrongly placed in an ESN school than a white kid. In other words, there were four times as many Black children in ESN schools who should not have been there as there were white working-class kids who also should not have been there. The ratio was four to one. Using this leaked report, Coard had shown for the first time that the education system knew that Black Caribbean children were being wrongly trapped in schools for the educationally subnormal yet continued to let it happen. I was able to point out to the Caribbean community that those in authority were not just doing something scandalously wrong. More importantly, they knew it, and even more importantly, having known it, were gonna do nothing about it. Caribbean parents were determined that the story shouldn't stay buried. Only two Black publishers existed the in UK. Coard's book was to be printed by one of them. John La Rose, an outstanding Caribbean activist, he saw the potential to galvanize the West Indian community. He saw it! I was the long-term partner of John La Rose, and together we founded New Beacon Books in 1966. New Beacon itself was not only a book shop, it also was a very activist organization. They were ably supported by another Caribbean publisher, Jessica Huntley and her husband Eric Huntley. By now, Jessica and Eric had launched Bogle L'Ouverture, the UK's second Black publishing house and bookshop. They galvanized additional support to make sure the book could be widely circulated. We wanted to raise money from the Black community, and this we did, and Jessica was very determined about this. Jessica was what I would call, in the best sense of the word, a harasser. She would ring me and say, "Hey! This, this, this, you have to do this. This is important. Put everything into it." So, these two are lions, heroes in my book. They were the driving force, and they mobilized, there were 26 West Indian organizations that came together because no publisher, no established publisher, would publish it. "The book will cost £750 to publish. Numerous interested organizations are each making a donation towards publication." Once printed, it was down to individual activists to make sure the book got out and word was spread. I've spoken to many, many educators and activists from that time. They would talk about actually, you know, going door to door in communities in London or Birmingham or Manchester. We did a lot of hard selling door to door. I remember going around Moss Side in Manchester with supermarket carrier bags full of the stuff and knocking on doors where we knew Black parents were living, talking to them about the books. Many people were buying books on their doorsteps. We got an awful lot of orders. I mean, it was quite unlike anything else we had ever published before, and we were terribly busy sending them out all over the place. So, in that sense, it was the first best seller. In households across the country, the publication of Coard's book now made the scandal over ESN schools a subject of national debate. Bernard remembers that at first the British education system remained in denial. The reaction of the establishment was very interesting. Literally on the night it was published, the leading educationalist in the ILEA appeared on television with me and the line was, "It's all rubbish, it's all lies." So, right there on the program, I quoted the statistics and said, "This is your own report. I've quoted extensively from your data and from your own conclusions. Are you saying that everything you all wrote and kept hidden are lies?" Bernard took every opportunity to broadcast the message. The school a child goes to, whether the child goes to a normal school or an ESN school, is determined by these I.Q. tests devised by educational science. You then proceed to put children in-in-in lower streams and in-in ESN schools, on-on the basis of this unscientific, unvalidated test. Then, obviously, five years from now you can throw your hands up in the air and say, "You see, we were right, these kids are ESN," having made sure that they get less facilities, less teaching equipment-- having, in short, actually engineered the environment for failure. It took six months, and at the end of six months, they said, "It's all true. I think we should use it in teachers' colleges, as recommended reading, and use it in schools of education. While Coard himself took to the airwaves, another aspect of his book would act as a reminder to Caribbean parents of the need to affirm their children's Black identity when no one else would. Chapter five of my book was written in... with a-a-a high level of anger and sadness, if it's possible to see how these two can be combined. When I witnessed that white kids and Black kids drew themselves as white, the Black kids, I was shocked by this. And when I did that research, again, on the orders of the Caribbean community, I read about the Black and white doll experiments. Two dolls, identical except for their color. Just watch how the children react. Think very hard: Which one would you like to be like? That one. Why would you like to be like that one? It's white. You tell me, which one would you like to be like? That one. Why would you like to be like that one? Because they keep calling you names and that. If every time you read every story, everything you watch on TV, in the newspapers, in magazines, in books, paints everything black and everybody Black as evil, as the devil, etcetera, and everything white as angelic, what do you expect-- not only for whites to believe about Blacks, but for Blacks to believe about themselves? Through the belittling, ignoring, or denial of a person's identity, one can destroy perhaps the most important aspect of a person's personality, his sense of identity and who he is. Without this, he will get nowhere. Coard's book was addressed directly to Black parents, a call to action for the community to provide their own solution. One of the recommendations was was that Black parents should encourage their children to read, reading literature which was inspiring to West Indian kids, which recognized and saluted their history and their culture and their contribution to civilization. The publishing that Bogle L'Ouverture Publications did and that New Beacon Books and John La Rose and Sarah White, they weren't just about bookselling, they were about providing the tools that communities could use to build an education movement in this country. We were the first ones to import books from the States with Black images on it. We printed. We did cards with a Black Christ. And, in those days, to have photographs and pictures and posters of Black people was very unusual. Everything was white! People now had access to books affirming their culture. But, with a deep mistrust of the State, they took the education of their children into their own hands. Another recommendation was the importance of building and having many more supplementary schools than already existed, and expanding it to become a nationwide phenomenon on a large scale, and getting West Indians themselves to contribute as teachers in these schools. Michael La Rose now runs the bookshop started by his father John, who hadn't been just a publisher. He was also one of the key figures in establishing the Black supplementary school movement in the UK. I was part of the George Padmore and Albertina Sylvester supplementary school which was one of the first Black supplementary schools in Britain. It started with my father, upstairs in his front room, and we had Albertina Sylvester, who strongly supported the school and brought her children to be part of the school. This supplemental school is one of several score that have recently sprung up in immigrant communities across Britain, all of them running on a voluntary system of self-help taught by teachers who give their time for nothing and who still believe in the basic three "R's." These were fiercely independent schools, were clear on the questions of racism, identity, and culture. These supplementary schools funded themselves through their parents. The importance of that was these were financially independent. We didn't get money from the Council and these others. They could not tell us what we could do or what we could not do. In the work that we did in supplementary schools, we knew that if we engaged with children in a manner that gave them some pride in themselves, and they could see themselves represented in the stuff they were using in schools-- books, pictures, stories, whatever-- then they would have a completely different attitude towards learning. Why do you think you learn more here? Some things they teach you here, you wouldn't be taught in school. - Do you like coming here and learning? - Yeah. Me personally, I was always having arguments with the history teacher. I remember once about Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves. And we had this ding-dong argument about that. And then he said, "Well, La Rose, you're right. I accept what you're saying." The point about it is, that confidence and that ability to-to challenge what's the given came from information I had been given. And I don't think I could have made those arguments if I didn't have that information at the supplementary school. Don't you get a bit bored coming to school twice a day? No. - Do you like it? - Yeah. For the first 10, 15 years, most of the West Indians who were of academic material and who went on to do degrees and doctorates and-and have important jobs in the various fields, have passed through the supplementary school movement as students. I think we rescued quite a number of children from education failure and underachievement. The parents needed that support, and they needed... to know that we, as members of the Black community, were taking some responsibility to correct the damage that was being done. The grassroots nature of Black supplementary schools means there are no official figures on how many existed at the peak of their popularity. Yet, for this generation, they were symbolic of how Black families could rise up to help themselves. However, it took longer for the government to respond to the specific concerns over the education of West Indian children. It wasn't until the late '70s that the government commissioned businessman Anthony Rampton to head a committee on the education of children from ethnic minority groups. I was co-opted to be a member of the Rampton Committee. I was in charge of special education. Waveney Bushell reviewed comments from head teachers regarding their opinions on Black pupils. All of the replies which I looked at had racist comments. They couldn't be described as anything else but racist. It took five years for the inquiry to be completed, and its conclusions were damning. It found that the low average IQ scores of West Indian children were not a significant factor in their low academic performance. Instead, racial prejudice in society at large was found to play a crucial role in their academic underachievement. The Swann Report suggests that the education system should change so that harmony, understanding, and fairness run through every aspect of a school's work. It meant that-that schools did have some kind of basis, some kind of space, to allow in a certain degree of multicultural and even anti-racist work. Attitudes towards children with special educational needs and disabilities also changed. A wide-ranging report recommended that, wherever possible, these children should be taught in mainstream schools. There was a growing movement for integration. By this I mean, getting rid of ESN schools and ensuring that children are schooled in the mainstream with different provisions made depending upon their level of need. The 1981 Education Act enshrined inclusivity in law, and the term "educationally subnormal" was abolished as an official category. There's no doubt that, over the last 30 years, Britain's schools have become more diverse and accepting places, and the supplementary school movement also encouraged more Black pupils to reach their true potential. But for all the progress that's been made, many Black people are still concerned. Good! Well done! A recent survey by the YMCA show that nine out of ten pupils had witnessed racist language at school. ...now moving into the module called "Identity." And almost half cited racism as the biggest barrier to their academic success. They mainly focus on, like, the Black girls at my school and, like, always, like, tell them off, and I always see them being, like, unfairly treated, and it just really frustrates me. When you learn about people in history, you start to realize that most of the people you are supposed to look up to don't look like you. And what does that tell you? Um, I think it just tells you that the education system doesn't want you to aspire to be what you are. Coard's book remains as resonant now as it was in 1971, with Black Caribbean children still being disproportionately removed from mainstream education. In one sense, the whole thing has moved full circle and the concerns we used to have about ESN are still very much with us now in terms of the number of Black children being put into Pupil Referral Units. Around 16,000 pupils are currently educated in Pupil Referral Units. They were set up in 1993 to teach children deemed unable to attend mainstream school, many of whom have been excluded. Black Caribbean children in particular are almost three times as likely to be permanently excluded from school as white British children. The most common reason given is for persistent disruptive behavior. Nobody could convince me that that continuous level of poor attainment or underachievement or whatever has got to do with the intellectual capabilities of those young people. It's got nothing at all to do with that. It would be unnatural if it did. So, therefore, the question is, what is it about the structural arrangements to do with schooling that continues to lead to the situation that we have right now? And that is the fundamental question. In 2019, some research in a government-commissioned review seemed to confirm the long-held suspicions of many Black parents. It concluded that institutional racism, albeit unintentional, resulted in differential treatment and discriminatory practices. Until these problems are solved, the shadow of injustice exposed by the ESN scandal still looms large.
