Yo, you alright? You alright? He was laying on his back there when I came through. Where the hell did he go? You okay? I am Matt Benton. I've been investigating paranormal phenomena for a whole decade of my life. What the fuck was that? Woah, listen. It all started with my experience at the Old Washoe Club. I was only 16 years old. I got my first interaction with a possible entity after asking a question in The Crypt inside. If there's a little girl here please do something. Touch me. Do make some kind of noise. Make a tapping noise. A piece of brick was thrown. That day I discovered you can get a response back from your questions and I was hooked. Having that interaction literally changed my life. Since then, I've been travelling the country looking for the most active paranormal locations, documenting my findings. And presenting them on my YouTube channel, Devil's Hour Productions. Every paranormal investigator is looking for that next level of paranormal activity, that Holy Grail location. ...and like blocked out that window. That was a big one. July 19th, 2013. The Hollywood film The Conjuring took the world by storm. A critically acclaimed horror film based on the haunting of the Harrisville Farmhouse. Through the perspectives of the Perron family, including Ed and Lorraine Warren. Every investigator has heard about the Warrens. They are pioneers of the paranormal. That's probably the worst thing we have in this whole museum. That Raggedy Ann doll was given to a nurse in 1970 by her mother as a Christmas present. I have researched some of their cases and one of them was the Harrisville Farmhouse. The kind of activity they reported having there is what I would call next level. So that we would then leave the house, evaluate our findings, and decide what it is we can do to help the family. If indeed there was anything that we could do to help them. In this case, I do not believe that any exorcism or any ritual of a religious nature or any one could ever clear that home of the very negative spirits which are involved in it. We have both human and inhuman spirits in this home which are bringing about these destructive acts. Destructive acts. Destructive acts. Destructive acts. This farmhouse piqued my interest. Is this house truly that next level location? I really wanted to investigate the extraordinary claims of levitation possession, apparitions and physical attacks. At the time, however, the Harrisville Farmhouse owner was not allowing investigations at the house. It wasn't until October 2019, I discovered that paranormal investigators Cory and Jennifer Heinzen had purchased the property. This gave me hope of getting access to film a documentary at the infamous Harrisville Farmhouse. I then told my friend, Joe Vitale, who has over 20 years of experience investigating the paranormal and runs his own YouTube channel, Entity Seven Paranormal. He was wanting to investigate the property just as much as I did, so we agreed to film there together as soon as possible. I got in contact with the Heinzens and they gave us permission and the dates we could film there. We were all set, except my team could not make it due to personal reasons. So we decided to gather a team of four paranormal YouTubers. Joe and I, Billy Cook from Paranormal Pursuit and Eric Connor from Epic Paranormal TV. The four of us have very different styles of investigating. Joe is very old school in the ways of paranormal investigating. Billy is the more grounded one in the group. Eric is very energetic and spiritual, the 100% believer. Others say I'm the more scientific minded investigator of the team and willing to put myself in dangerous situations. March 16th, 2020. I'm in Massachusetts. For the first time in my life, I'm in Massachusetts. And I'm on the way to our location, to the-- the conjuring house, the real conjuring house. This is the house where the events of the Conjuring movie one took place. This is the place where Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated. So I'm on my way to meet up with Matt, Joe and Billy. They're already at the location, to my knowledge, so I'll be arriving there shortly. I'm very excited, I've, like I said, I've never even been in the state. I've never been this far north and I've never been to this location. And I've also never investigated with Matt or with Billy. We've all talked online, you know, plenty. But this will be our first time investigating a location together. And we've got two days. We've got two days and two nights. We got it all. It's going to be-- It's going to be lit. So let's go. Let's get it. My heart's beating a little bit. A little bit racing here. I did my homework on this location, so I know the potential of what we might be walking into. The day has finally come where we set foot on the Harrisville Farmhouse property for the very first time. We wanted to uncover the real history and experiences of the house. So we interviewed Keith and Carl Johnson, the first paranormal investigators and demonologists to ever investigate the house. Next, we interviewed Cory Heinzen, the current owner of the farmhouse, as well as John Huntington, also a paranormal investigator. He investigated the house the longest and lived there for nine months with the Heinzens as a caretaker. Lastly, Andrea Perron was interviewed. She experienced this infamous haunting first-hand for ten years on the property. Her story is the reason why we are here. What kind of led you on a path that you finally were able to come to this house? What brought you to this house? It was in the early 1970s, 1973, actually. And I was part of an organization. My brother and I, my brother Carl, were members of P.I.R.O based at Rhode Island College. Parapsychological Investigation and Research Organization. And as I said, there was no Internet back then. So how do I get the word out that we do investigations free of charge? So I just illustrated a little ad myself, put it in a local newspaper, and it was three weeks later, to the day actually that it was answered by Mrs. Carolyn Perron in Harrisville Rhode Island. And she said she had moved in a couple of years ago to a house that was built in 1736 and things were happening that were becoming very terrifying, downright terrifying. And she was wondering if we could come and check out her situation. Logic tells you that something that is immaterial, that there's a shadow or something else, that wind that passes by you, it lifts your hair. It cannot really hurt you. I still feel threatened. I feel threatened. As soon as we arrived on the property, we felt almost like a barrier. It was like a barrier when we stepped out of the car, the atmosphere was very different. I mean, nice family, the Perron family, very nice people, all American family. Yet the property and the house itself, you really felt that something was kind of wrong. It was like a very, very negative energy we sensed and I believed it to not be a human spirit. I believed it to be an inhuman spirit, a demon, if you will. So Carolyn Perron was most affected by this whatever the house had. She would awaken with scratches on her arms and torso, and she was visibly shrinking. She was losing weight rapidly, so it was affecting her profoundly. A coat hanger came down from the rack. I didn't bump it, I didn't touch it, I wasn't near it. I was bending over at the time. Came down off the rack, and started pounding me on the head, six or eight times. I needed-- And we had seen things. We had seen my mother under attack in the closet downstairs off the bathroom. Beaten inexplicably with a wooden coat hanger after stepping out of the shower. And she started screaming and we all ran in to see what was wrong with mom, including our neighbour that had stopped by with a cake. And she saw it too, and never came back to the house. But, you know, my mother was attacked physically a number of times. Have you met the Perrons? Yes, we've been able to meet all the Perrons except for Carolyn. Carolyn refuses to come back up here. And there was a sister that passed away a few years ago, unfortunately, that we weren't able to meet. Yeah, they had them all up here a few months ago. And that was-- You could tell-- Like you can tell when somebody has been through something and they had certainly been through something. Mr. McKeachern who was a historian in his nineties, when we moved there, he came and introduced himself to my mother and our family. The spirit that was haunting my mother clearly had a broken neck hanging literally off the side of her dress. And Mr. McKeachern told my mother that it was Mrs. Arnold, and their farm hand took her body down and moved her into the house so that she would be able to be buried in the family plot in the cemetery rather than being excluded because she had taken her own life. Carolyn Perron did have a very disturbing experience in her bedroom where one morning it was shortly after our first visit, it was about 5:15 in the morning, she woke up and there was something in her room. She smelled the scent of sulphur and decaying mingled. There was something even fizzling for a moment on her dresser, some kind of light. But then she looked over and there's this-- It's very difficult to describe what she saw, some kind of monstrosity and vaguely in the shape of a female apparition wearing a long gray dress. But the head was cocked to one side on the shoulder as if the neck had been broken, and it began chanting to her. "I'll drive you mad with fiery brooms. I'll drive you mad with death and gloom. I'll drive you out but it will be too late. You'll be dead." And then it just leered at her and vanished. A myth surrounds the Harrisville Farmhouse involving Bathsheba Sherman. People claim she was a witch and a Satanist who murdered a baby with a sewing needle. Through research, however, this appears to be far from the truth. Bathsheba Thayer Sherman Greene was a actual historical person. She was a resident of Harrisville. She was a member of the Harrisville Baptist Church at the time of her life. She married Judson Sherman. They had a rather prosperous farm. And somehow-- Somehow, we don't know how, rumours started up about her years ago, quite a long time ago, she was accused of being a satanic witch and supposedly had killed a baby here. Sacrificed it, made it look like an accident by impaling it with a sewing needle. And there's been a lot of research done on that. And there's been no actual historical evidence that that ever happened. We contacted Kenny Biddle, a researcher and writer who has spent a year researching the history of the farmhouse. He will give us the facts of the authentic history of the property. If Bathsheba was an evil witch that killed a baby, it would be in her obituary. That's what they put in those obituaries back then. They told your-- They condensed your life story with the highlights in that obituary. So I guarantee, without a doubt, if she had murdered a baby, it would be in that obituary. On top of that, it's like back then they took that seriously if they-- You were considered a witch, you would have been shamed for it and even killed for it. Definitely won't be buried in a Baptist cemetery. She would be in the newspapers. We should be able to find newspaper articles about this, but there was nothing. But unfortunately, between the movie and the books that were written about it, and then the hundreds of YouTube channels that just repeat shit ad nauseam. This is the story that's out there. This is what people know. It's the common knowledge now, and it's an uphill battle for people like me and documentaries like this to present the real history. The only death that was on the property was Jarvis Smith was a man that he was-- He was walking along and he actually-- It was wintertime. It sounds like he was drunk and he took shelter in one of their sheds, a shed that's no longer there that's been gone for decades. But he was there and he died overnight. He froze to death on the property. No unusual history of deaths from the farmhouse, however, before the Harrisville Farmhouse was built, King Philip's war took place throughout Massachusetts and Rhode Island. From 1675 through 1678, the Narragansett and Wampanoag tribes fought a brutal war with the colonists. Thousands were left dead, villages were torched, women and children murdered and buried alive, leaving the farmhouse land possibly haunted. It was actually P.I.R.O who contacted the Warrens about the situation here. And we were here first and investigated and of course, experienced quite a bit of activity here. And we sat down at our next meeting and said, "I really," you know, we were talking about how we should call in Ed and Lorraine Warren just to see what their take was. Actually, Lorraine Warren arranged something I personally would not recommend, she recommended that they arrange a séance which took place right in this room, right where we're sitting now. And of course, Carolyn Perron was going to be the conduit. She was the one that was going to communicate since the spirit was oppressing her. Lorraine thought perhaps this spirit, if they hold a séance, and they had another psychic medium here as well that was actually conducting the séance, and they hoped that the spirit would communicate through Carolyn Perron and say what it wanted. My father didn't want to have anything to do with that. He strenuously objected to the ritual going forward. It took Ed Warren as a priest quite a while to convince him that it was necessary. And then the mediums started conjuring the spirit. That's where the name of the film came from. And in the process of doing that, she collapsed unconscious on the table, the table rose up and came back down on the floor. My mother started howling like a banshee, she started speaking in a language that does not exist on this earth. The chair that she was in raised up off the floor and in a split second she and the chair were tossed from the middle of the dining room into the middle of the parlor. Literally thrown off the chair halfway across the room, wound up crumpled on the floor. To all appearances she had, she was dead. She wasn't showing any life signs at all. And of course, Roger ran over to revive her and she did start breathing again. Meanwhile, Ed Warren advised him, "You really shouldn't touch the possessed at this point." And that's where Roger lost it, he dismissed the Warrens very, very adamantly. He actually literally threw Ed out of the house. And that's how it culminated there, their involvement in this case. And everyone present in the house heard my mother sulk at that floor and everyone present in that house thought she had died. It was a nightmare. It was the worst moments of my life that shouldn't have even happened. It's my personal opinion, though. Have you had anybody that's scared to investigate after coming here? We've had a few teams leave in the middle of the night. Just because, you know, it gets too real too soon. Some people just aren't ready for it. You know, they just think it's just going to be one of those run of the mill, you know, hauntings. And it's pretty much up in your face. I hear you out there. I saw it move a little bit. Oh, fuck. Holy fuck. That's fucking scary. Okay, John, tell us a little bit about some of the experiences you've had in this house. Scariest thing is I had a voice yell hello at me. I came out here and I heard a bunch of rustling around and stuff and banging and sounded like someone was going through something. So I just kind of went quietly walked back, got my phone, started recording and then I heard a girl say hello out loud, which kind of startled me. I heard some knocking and banging sounds When I walked through a minute ago. So I thought just grab my camera. It's a car going by. Hello. What the fuck? Hello? Goosebumps. I also had like a toy car come off from the chairs. And the library book came off the shelf. I'd just gotten up in the morning and noticed it on the floor. And I came right back and asked Bill if, you know, did you see a-- Was there a book on the floor yesterday? You know, we reviewed the tape and sure enough, it just came right off the shelf. What kind of tools, investigator wise, have you had successfully? We had our DR16 here a few weeks ago, we got some pretty crazy stuff. Alright, I'm just going to ask who is here with us, because this is crazy. Alright, here we go, guys. Oh, it's full. Okay, we're going to leave that on. Okay, recording now. Who is here with us? Who is here with us? Fuck you. Did I just hear a-- Did I just hear what I-- What I think I heard? ...is here with us? I haven't slowed what sound is coming. Fuck you. Fuck! Oh, something's not happy, guys. Something is not happy. Fuck you. Oh, my God, dude. Oh, my God. That was a little alarming, guys, to be honest. I almost want to say it was common place to see things move on their own. Oh God, we all came to this place, we came in peace, and we leave in peace. Taking nothing unholy or unnatural with us And we pray for our safety tonight. That they may be kept safe and they mean no harm, no danger as they explore the wonders of creation. We pray to your holy name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Before the investigation, our friend, Jason Emerick, an investigator and medium, had given Joe a warning that I was not told about for experimental purposes. And he's going to see if he can communicate with the spirits from here at his place. Got you. And right now, I'm not going to say what he's telling me right now just yet. Here, do you want to film it, though? -Go ahead and film it. -But it was interesting. So that way they can see what time it's at you know, before everything. At around 8 p.m., we commenced our investigation in the basement. Eric was live on his YouTube channel during the first hour. This is what was captured on night-one in the house. Immediately, that same feeling in here. I just had the same exact feeling I got when I walked in here the first time. There is energy in this room. That's it, Bill. That's the well. Wow. Yeah, there's a clear, concise energy in here that I can just feel as soon as we get here. And there's obviously, like a change in temperature, like it's cooler in this room, the air's crisper in this room. But there's something else too, there's almost like a static energy on top of the air. -Woah, woah, woah. -Within the air. It's clear too. Here, I'm going to restart. -Ready? -Yes, sir. Do you get any energy from this well, from this water source? I didn't feel the energy in here, like clearly. It feels like it is natural energy. I'm not feeling any kind of like presence, but I'm feeling just like a whole bunch of energy. I have to be very careful. I have face tracking on my cameras, and my phones and stuff, and in my basement, it'll-- What are you doing? You just stepped right into the well. Actually, what if I go down there? You ain't getting back up. -Okay, let's do this. -I'll help you. -Are you really doing it? -Sure. Oh, goodness. Dude, you're going to lose some equipment in that well. Definitely going to fall off. -Are you going to hang like-- -Hang. How it's going to work? Whistle or EVP? Yeah. If we're not capturing his death, it's not worth it. He's an extreme investigator for a reason, y'all. Dude, that's not going to work. Be very, very careful. I hope that he falls. Yeah, if he falls, you and me are picking him out of there, -so get ready. -Me and you who? Can someone put a flash light at me? -Yeah, I got you. Hold on. -Let me see what I got. Here. At this moment, we capture a possible disembodied voice The torch. The torch. The torch. This voice is so clear and has human tone to it. We start to think that it could have been one of us. When reviewing all the video, we don't see any of our lips move. But Billy and I are both facing away from the cameras during this moment. The torch. The torch. The torch. The thing that is odd about this, though, is that as Americans, we do not typically call flash lights, torches. So it doesn't seem like our characteristics and none of us remember saying this. So we're leaving this up to you to decide. Like, I wonder if they've got a camera or something? Here, do you need any help out of there? -Got it. -Got it? Okay. So, guys, Matt seriously does extreme paranormal investigations. He goes for it. All of us were like, "Well, no, no," but he did it. Something's wrong with that rec, let's do one more rec, okay? Alright, here we go. We're going to be here for a while. Do you have any messages or warnings for us? That's weird. Alright, so if the doorway is open, will you say doorway, please? You alright? -What happened? -I don't know. I'll say I got really dizzy for a second. How are you feeling now? I'm feeling okay now. That was weird, right? When you said that. Yeah, that whole session was weird. Dude right when you said that though, I had like-- I just, like, felt like my-- Like my eyes just rolled back and then I got really dizzy for a second. That was weird. That's scary. When I said, what, the doorway thing? Yeah. Oh, oh, hey. Come here. Right this way. -What's that? -No, maybe it was a tree. -Is there a tree? -No. What the hell was that then? And I thought that was a Christmas tree. I thought there was a Christmas tree right here. -You saw a shadow? -Yeah. It looks like a Christmas tree was right here. And then, all of a sudden it moved. And then I thought it was the lighting. -But no, it was-- -Is there a camera? Security camera somewhere here? -Oh, yes, yes, yes. -Where? I thought I installed some. -No, not here. -Oh, it's here at the steps. But it was the craziest thing because I thought... There's one at the very end. I thought it was a Christmas tree. And from your-- From your lighting, when you were messing with the lighting, it looked like maybe it was, you know, when you brighten the light, it then make the shadows kind of move a little bit. That's what I thought was happening. And I was like, "Oh, no, it's just a Christmas tree." And then I noticed that there's not a Christmas tree here. It was-- That's what it looked like to me. -That's pretty wild. -Hold on, Matt. Where does this one go to? -It's blocked off. -No. -They're locked up. -We can't go through that. About 22 minutes later, we head up to the second floor and we experience something absolutely fascinating. This is my first time. Holy cow! Please, dude. Hello. -Was that Matt? -Yeah. He shut the door and locked himself in. Oh, I can unlock it. Bro. -I want to be in here. -You want some solo time? -Yeah. -Alright. He's alright. He's just doing some solo work. Anyone in here with me? That's right, Eric. That's the area. This set up? Everything? Can you move something? Can you move this stuff right now? Can you show yourself right now? Crooked-neck lady. Crooked-neck lady. Come forth. Into the gateway in the black mirror. Maybe restart it. You said that's good. A little help right here. I felt dizzy again. That was interesting. We're trying to get in contact with you. We are giving you permission to make your presence known. -Guys? -Woah, woah! You didn't see that? A bug just flew and landed on my hand. Guys? Yeah, I saw it come through but really, it looked like a little black circle. -Like, it landed on my hand. -Do you think it's a bug? You sure it was a bug or was it a black circle? Hey, guys. Oh, my God. Matt, why do you do this? What's up? Wait, wait, how do this-- How does this work? What's good, my man? What's good? Come check this out. We're on the way. Please don't change it. Alright, so we just got walkied in over here. What's going down? Look how coincidental this is. -I didn't even touch it. -What? What do we got? Oh, my God. Look, look. -Look. -I just thought that was weird. I was-- And you were recording when you came in here. So we'll be able to see that you came straight in. Actually, I even recorded me walking towards it too. And so there are no cuts, no cuts. -Look at that. -Okay. Bro, is it not crazy? That's crazy. So I just noticed that when I was walking down there. That is-- That is wild, dude. That's wild. No cuts. No cuts. Seven. Seven. I am seven. You are nothing. Seven. A possible demonic entity that Joe, Eric and myself have experienced in past investigations. It seems to follow us to different locations. With Jason's warning to Joe about seven, could it be the entity or is it referencing the seven soldiers said to be buried behind the wall? And they're all saying together at once. "There are seven dead soldiers buried in the wall." "There are seven dead soldiers buried in the wall." And is the block a coincidence or a sign? I think you would have noticed that, though. I would have made a big deal about it if I noticed it. But I'm saying, like, what if I like filmed, it wasn't, you know what I mean, like-- Even though like it was most likely not moved like since we've been here but I just thought it was a weird ass coincidence. -Oh, yeah, I know. -Yeah. That thing is pretty strange. Literally the number-- And you walked in here by yourself and saw it. No wonder you radioed us. That makes sense. No, I just wanted you to see what was up. I mean, I was kind of cool. It seems like a sign. It seems like a sign. Especially, we're going to show you some stuff later. I don't know when but Joe and me will have to show you at some point and you know, it'll all come together. It'll all be very, very informative. Should you be sharing the-- Your, what, your session also at first? Or what-- Or Jason Emerick's first? -Let's do-- -Any relations to any of two? I feel like-- I feel like I should do-- -I should do a tarot reading. -Oh, shit! -What? What? What? -The rocking chair. -It's moving. It's moving. -Move, move, move. Okay, jump around. Jump around. Okay. Yes, it was moving. It was fucking moving. -I caught a little bit. -Hold on. -I got it, I got it. -I'll go this side. I got a little bit of it. The boards don't go all the way through there. Okay, back up, guys. Let's back up. -I gotta try. -Give us some space. Give us some space for a bit. We'll try and debunk after this. At first, well, I want to try and get the-- I want to try and get the phenomena first. Then we'll try to debunk, okay? -Okay. -Alright, because this just happened, so if they could do it again, let's see if it can. If you're here, I did say-- When I was in here, I have it on video, when I was in here, I said, if you're in here can you please make something move? So just as that happened, my camera died. -And it started moving? -It started moving. That's freaky. -What happened? -My camera's dead. Here I have another one for you. That's crazy. I saw that rocking chair moving. -I put my camera on it too. -I caught a little bit of it. I didn't capture it initiating is the issue. No one's going to believe it. I thought it was an optical illusion at first because of the way that the rails are. Yeah. Why didn't we give Bill the other AH33 or the 53? -I know. -Why? Hook him up with it right now. It's downstairs, I don't think it has battery in it too. Alright, I'll grab it. -We're here. -Joe? Joe? -Joe? -Joe? Joe? Oh, God. It's the exact kind of sound when you said Joe earlier. Every place with donations, Crystal-T... This is on too. ..keeping it ultra real. -Guys! Guys! -What? What? -We have it. We have it. -Hold. Hold up. -Hold up. Hold up. -Look. -Oh, yeah! -Yes, we have it. That's right. We have cameras all over. What time is it? Yo Bill. I'll check this too, just in case. Yeah, check time. Check time. -Surely that's wide enough. -It's 2:22. So I'll say around 10:00 o'clock. At 10:12 p.m., the Heinzen family's DVR system captured the rocking chair move on its own. Before we reviewed the footage, we tried every method we could think of to debunk the chair moving on its own. We stomped on the ground near the chair and it didn't budge. Okay, jump around. Jump around. Okay. Yes, it was moving. It was fucking moving. -I caught a little bit. -Hold on. I got it. I got it. I caught a little bit of it. The boards don't go all the way through there. Okay, back up, guys. Let's just back up. -I gotta try. -Give us some space. Give us some space for a bit. We'll try and debunk after this. At first, well, I want to try and get the-- I want to try and get the phenomena first and then we'll try to debunk, okay? -Okay. -Alright, because this just happened so if it could do it again, let's see if it can. This should not have moved. Now I wanna do the debunking process. I was trying to get it to do it again right off the bat, right? That's why I didn't want to do it then. But now let's try and do a debunk-- Another debunk process. -So here-- -Step around, guys. Billy was where you are and we were over here, so yeah. -Nothing. It's not even moving. -Let's just stomp. -But we weren't doing that. -Yeah, we weren't. I'm just trying to over dramatize it because then it shows even more that it's not us. -And that's crazy. -It's not moving at all. No, it's not. So this moved by itself, we captured it. We then recreated a door vacuum and that also did not make it budge. Seriously said, "Can you move something?" Actually, hold on, hold on. I think I might know how to debunk us. Open that door. Close it, open it. Suction effect. Okay, now open it how you did before. Opened it big too. -So if there's any-- -That's not doing it. After reviewing the footage, we know exactly where Bill stepped when the chair moved. As you can see, he steps in between the fourth and fifth wooden plank, right when the rocking chair initiates. Which is about a foot away from the chair. We also checked if this cord had been wrapped around the chair prior to it moving. Upon review of the video, eight minutes before the chair moved, the cord was in the same spot, not touching the rocking chair. When we headed downstairs, our walkie talkies had an electrical interference. Woah! You guys pressed the button? You guys pressed any-- Guys, are you pressing this? Guys? Guys, are you doing this? Camera's on. When I walked into this room, it started doing this. -Really? -Yeah. And you were recording the whole time? Yeah, the whole time I was recording. -It just went on. -Somebody hold. Somebody hold. -This is weird. -Here. Oh, now this is weird. It's when you cross over the threshold. -What the heck? -What? -Dude! -That's weird. Wait, turn back like that. Turn back like that. Right there. Stay right there. -Bill, can you say hello? -Can you speak to me? -Yeah. -Yep. I'll turn this one off because... That one's not doing it. Power on. It's only mine. And the other one's upstairs. We both left it upstairs. -It's literally only yours, yo. -That's weird. Oh, my God. Whoa! Why are you doing this? This kind of reminds me of Cosmopolitan. Something like this happened to me in Cosmopolitan. Similar, but not like this. This is more direct. That's so crazy. Look, as soon as he crosses that threshold. -Alright, walk forward. -Yeah, walk closer to the door. Because that's where originally... It's not. Oh, there it is. What's upstairs, dude? What if that's a-- You know, the-- Maybe look up some tech forums. Yeah, see, different walkie talkies do this every now and then. I've never seen this before. This is really... And then it stops like entirely right there. Yeah. It's not going off at all. Moving around erratically doesn't do anything. Right. Bro, that's crazy. That's weird. Ten, four, three. You got it on three, alright. Ten. -So it's just on three. -Only three? That's three because the one upstairs is on three. This is the marking of the Trinity too. -Oh, my God. -That's fucking weird. It's only doing it on three. Hey, now one's doing it. It's on three? -Yeah. -Only on three. I'm telling you it's something more than-- It's got to be EMF. Switch it to two. Take them on two, Bill. It doesn't make sense. They should still be doing it. Yeah, it's just the frequency. Maybe it's a tower close that you know, it's picking up a signal. And whatever's in between there is causing an interference. It seemed to be a natural phenomena because we could recreate it on every walkie talkie while on channel three. Another source of EMF could be the cause. While on break, Joe went outside to retrieve some items from the car. Then, as he entered the house, he had his own experience. And dude, iPhone was actually going to have... -Who the fuck was in here? -What? Who the fuck was in here? What do you mean, who the fuck was in there? Dude, I swear to God, I thought one of you guys were in here. -No. Why? -Because I looked over, I thought-- I thought it was you, Matt, that was in here. Did you see someone in there? Then I thought, I looked over and see Matt, I thought maybe it was you, Eric. Yeah, I saw somebody in here. It was standing right over here. Well, I'm having a deja vu moment right now. I thought I saw someone standing right there. You know, there's this tripod and everything. But it was right here. Dude, I'm having a deja vu moment right now. It's weird because remember you-- I remember you in this situation now right now. Well, here, let's... If you're in here with this, can you give us another sign? Joe just saw you. We ended our first night with a séance and Ouija board session. This is when I had another personal experience. -Rumbling. -It's like rumbling. Guys, guys, I was like, I fucking felt something weird. I literally have tears right now. What happened? I was... I don't know. Well, what-- What were you feeling? So for a second when I closed my eyes, I just felt like something from above just went straight through my body, through my spine and... I don't know how to explain it. It was... That sounds familiar. Yeah, in my meditation I saw something coming from above the house, into the house, go in the floor and then it came up out of the floor it's like six or seven different things of-- It's-- It was-- It was very strange. But that same kind of experience with it coming down into the building. It was just like white energy, it was like a white string energy, it was massive at first. Yeah, I felt the pulse of like-- But it came from above of me. It came from above and straight into my-- Through my spine to the ground like, through my body, straight to the ground. That's weird. We've had a lot of correlating stuff happened. Alright, keep focusing, y'all. Keep focusing. Joe and Eric are the only ones that knew of Jason's warning. I had no prior knowledge and seemed to be the only one affected at this location. It is very rare for this to happen to me. In the morning of our second day at the Farmhouse, I talked to Cory about reviewing the footage from the DVR cameras. So last night we did capture some interesting things. So the two biggest moments would be the rocking chair moving by itself. We even tried to debunk that and we have it on DVR because you have a camera pointing straight at it and we want to review that with you, if that's possible. Oh, of course. Yeah. And then another thing is that Joe said he saw an apparition right here and you have a DVR pointing this direction. So we want to review that. We have the times marked down around that time period, so that we could easily find it. Easy enough. -Hey, Eric. -Yeah? Do what? What are you doing? Okay. -What's up? -We reviewed the footage. -Okay. -But we captured it. We captured it, clear as day. -No way. No way. -Yeah. Alright, I'm coming, I'm coming. Holy crap. No way. Yes, that is awesome. So we captured it, is what you're saying? Yes, we captured it. We captured it. I want your guys's reaction to this. Yeah, I haven't seen this yet. Alright. Ready? -Ready. -Yeah. Let's see. Holy crap. Oh, my God. And so we tried to recreate that for, like, 30 minutes, trying to jump around, pounding on the floor. There-- There was-- That's crazy. A huge movement. -Can we see it again? -Yeah. Just because that was just so incredible. It was incredible. Well, you-- I mean, I just-- I jumped back. -I was like, what the heck! -Yeah. I was wondering because you said you're walking up to it and I didn't have any idea of how close you were to it. But this is-- This is amazing. This is fantastic. And watch, you're going to see him get away from it when it starts. Oh, my God. Now, another thing, though, is like he didn't step on it, he didn't step on it. In order for him to step on it like he would have to be at an awkward angle. -Yeah. -You know, like to reach out -and step with his foot. -Yeah. -So if anybody thinks that. -I'd have my leg stretched -in front of me and-- -He'd have to been way closer. And it starts rocking before he's even halfway through this board. And then he takes, like, another step after it's already started dropping. Yeah, because I didn't notice it, yeah. I mean, that's-- My first reaction was I thought it was the lighting from everybody's cameras. You know, and I thought that a shadow was moving on the wall from the lighting, -but it was the actual rocking. -It was the chair. You see that clear as day on camera. We just caught an amazing piece of evidence right here. Upon trying to review the footage of the possible shadow figure seen by Joe, we found that the camera had unexplainably stopped during the night. Wait a second. What's going on here? Oh, is there no footage here? Look at the time code, is it fast forwarding? Yeah. That's weird. Blocked camera? That's what I'm saying. Holy crap. You're on 17 right now. But if you just press the play button, see what happens. That's what he did initially and it started fast forwarding. -Like, see? -What the hell? Look at that, it's jumping wildly. Oh, come on, no way. -Man! -What the hell? Okay, where we are right now? Okay. Okay. It shows movement, though, right? Those are the green spots. Yeah, it should be but it should be playing at this point because you're right-- Right here at 1300. Now 15, 16, 17, 18. -So we're all okay now. -It's jumping. It's jumping. And then around there's when it was captured. Oh, ain't that fucking convenient? -What the hell? -The fuck? Are you shitting me? While we were outside filming B-roll, I went back inside to grab my camera and jacket. And while I came back, Eric told me something interesting. We're outside, about to do some drone shots, and I thought Matt had came out in his T-shirt and then went back in, to, I guess, get a jacket or something. He said he hadn't come out at all, right? No, I-- The only time I came out was when I just-- You just now saw me come out. I was actually looking for this camera. I saw him 100% come around that corner. It was him to a tee, his shirt, his hat, everything. It was 100% you. -Yeah. -Dude, that's crazy. I saw a doppelganger of Matt here. That's weird. Could it have been my doppelganger Eric saw? This is only one of many encounters we have had of possible mimicking. I don't know, where-- So you heard it while you're in the bathroom or when you were coming out. I was still in the bathroom, I was getting ready to come out. And I heard a little girl say, "Daddy." Did it come from, like in the bathroom or out here. What do you think? No, it definitely came from out here. -Got you. -So, I don't know. It's just weird stuff like that. It's bizarre. Well, I was going to say that daddy thing, I guarantee you, that's not a little girl calling out for her daddy. That is so like-- Yeah, that's so-- It's too typical. You know what I mean? That's too, like that is-- That is definitely something like mimicking or something. Right. Check this out, though. So Bill had his daughter on the phone, remember, on his speaker phone? That's right. Maybe that helped trigger something. Maybe. Also, what I found interesting is when you mentioned the mimicking thing, remember what you saw earlier, of me; seeing me -in my t-shirt. -That's right. Hold on. So that's a good point. I saw him walk around the corner of the house when we were getting ready to do a drone shot. I saw him walk out in his t-shirt and then he walked back and then he came back out with the jacket. And I was like, "Did you walk, you know, walk out and then walk back?" And he said, "No, not at all." It was him. I saw him exactly but there was no one there. I saw the doppelganger of Matt walk on the side of this building. Well, see, well, that was last night when I come in. I thought Matt was in there. Oh, yeah. That was your initial thought -is you thought it was Matt. -Right. And I looked in here and at first I only seen you and Billy, so I thought Matt was in there and I looked in there again. I didn't see anybody. And then when I turned to look again, -there was Matt. -There he was. I'm like, "Whoa, wait a minute." And then damn camera. Yeah, the camera, right after that, completely no-- No footage at all on camera five. All the rest of the cameras recorded just fine throughout the entire night, the entire investigation, camera five, for some reason, doesn't have any footage on it. That's just strange. That's just strange. What we know now is that this thing is mimicking. Yeah. Completely mimicking in multiple different ways. And that's very strange and we all know that what that possibly leads to so... Before we arrived at the Harrisville Farmhouse, Eric conducted a tarot card reading and now he is revealing their meaning. Some of what he mentions foreshadows what is to come. The card visible at the center of the cross represents the obstacle that stands in your way, it may even be something that sounds good but is not actually good to your benefit. Strength, courage, fortitude, conviction, energy, determination, defiance, action, awareness of temptation and the mental and physical abilities to overcome them. Hidden forces at work are challenged. Heroism, virility, strength to endure in spite of obstacles. We got the seven of cups reversed. -There's that number. -Yeah, and it's also reversed. Which means desire, determination, strong willpower, a goal attained, intelligent choice, desire, will, resolution The card at the right of the cross represents an approaching influence or something to be embraced. Alright, here's the capability of perceiving temptation and avoiding evil. So again, that's good. Now, here's the last one. The card at the top of the staff represents the ultimate outcome should you continue on this course. We got the Knight of Cups reversed. Subtlety, artifice, trickery, deception, fraud, a sly and cunning person, a person capable of swindling. So basically this thing's thinking this is going to be a battle, an absolute battle, and it's going to be battles of despair, battles of hidden forces, battles of evil and good in this house with the spirits and with us. And then he talked about Matt. This is leading up to what you and I know about the message from Emerick. Oh, yeah. Do you want me to talk about that now? Yeah, talk about that now and then I'll go ahead and reveal. Okay. We're talking about the Jason Emerick thing. Okay, listen, Billy and I don't know anything about it. So this is new. "Seven will be there. Matt needs to be careful. I don't know what to say really to what was coming through. I know they're all going to be all over his energy. They said his name more than once, within minutes. Sounds. Or within minutes, seconds. The door is open." Everything he said came true. Now he said inside the mirror, the Black Mirror Ouija board. "Please tell Matt to please take extra precaution." About an hour after being informed about Jason's warning, we started gearing up for our 30 minute individual isolation experiment. So right now we're about to do our solo sessions, and this is going to be your setup. It's a very similar setup to what I use for Man Versus Paranormal. So you got everything you need. It's a 4K night vision camera. A good audio Zoom H4M pro. Dead light, the best IR light in the business. And then we have a face cam for your reactions because we want those reactions also it's good for EVPs if we can-- So you know that he's not whispering or something like that he's in the building by himself. So if there's any voice and it shows him not whispering, that's going to be interesting. And especially for disembodied voices, this will capture the disembodied voices because of how clear this audio is. So here it is. This is going to be our solo setup and it works really well for me for Man Versus Paranormal so... This is a beast, this a frigging beast, dude. This is awesome. They call you Matt Tactical for a reason. Oh, my goodness. There is something up here. Like one hundo. Like, no joke. Like one hundo. Eric says there's someone up there. Hello? Alright, I got to bust out some equipment here because I know you're here. There was just a noise in the corner, I think. Look, if you're familiar with me and the equipment, will you make a noise in here? So that way I know-- So that way I know. I'm going to-- I'm going to walk into the center room here. Everything, every fibre of my being is telling me to turn on the flash light. So is someone over here? If so, can you please say something? Here, I'm going to bust out a recorder that you haven't seen yet. It's called the Sony Saint. It's the Sony ST25. I'm hitting record, so when I hit record, you can talk and I'll hear you. William, are you here? What was that? Fellas, are you all talking? Did Joe just say something real loud? None of us said anything. No one said anything? No. Okay. I got to get into this other room. Oh, my God. That voice was clear as day. It sounded like Joe talking. It was that type of voice. I swear, that sounded like Joe talking. That's crazy. I only hit play on the Sony Saint. Remember the mimicking. Oh, that's right. The mimicking. Oh, my God, I forgot about that. Holy crap. And it sounded just like Joe. Oh, man. Ooh! Well, I'm going to listen back because I think I was recording when it happened. William, are you here? William, are you here? Hey, wait, I'm going to turn the compressor on. Whoa, I think that was it. I caught it. I caught it. I caught it on the Sony Saint. Are you there? Right there. William, are you here? What was that? Fellas, are you all talking? Did Joe just say something real loud? I'm going to set this down for a second. Fellas, what's my time like, am I at 15 minutes? 16 minutes and 48 seconds. Got you. Alright, it's time to go downstairs. Alright, let's get resituated. Oh, goodness gracious. The door's like partially cracked open. Oh, the cellar, if you will. That was me. Are you kidding? I just felt a gust of wind from my right side. Here we go. Oh, that's a big first step, jeez! The gateway is radio silence. You know what? If the gateway's going to be silent... Well, here, I'll switch to AM at some point. Not right now. Alright, first steps in the basement. Oh, no. Is there anyone down here? Spirits, can you tell me, is there anything down here? There's something walking around. Man, I'm feeling stuff all over me, on my head and my hand. Who's there? I have to go upstairs after this. But this is Eric from Epic. What do you want to tell us for tonight? Oh, goodness. That fricking heat or something just turned on. Okay, time is up. Time is up. Alright, hitting stop. Try the different buttons. It's up to you. Good luck. Thanks. Let's do this. You got this, man. You've got this. So Matt's style is kind of in between all of ours. Well, Matt's far more scientific but I can tell, I mean, he's getting open to more things. He's been real open on this journey. Talking about goosebumps, huh? Yeah, I know the feeling. Okay. Just you and I right now. I'm really feeling you, so you better do something good. Well, I feel you all over. Okay. If there's an entity here, let's get you going here. Let's actually have a conversation and let's make something happen. That's me sighing. Okay. Come on. Where are you hiding at, huh? If you're a demon, if you're just calling yourself a demon. You're not showing your strength your so-called strength. You affected a family, a whole family terrified of you. But you can't do a single thing to terrify me. If you want to really scare me? Physically hurt me. Physically. -Jeez. -I give you permission. The paranormal drives every fiber of my being. I am riveted by it. When I invite an entity to physically hurt me, I mean it, especially if it helps paranormal phenomena to manifest. I give you permission. I heard you lift beds, move beds. I hear you attacking people. What a... I'm standing here offering it. Literally, an offering. All this talk and affecting a family so horribly and then when someone stands up to you, you back off. Well, most people would say, this is stupid what I'm doing right now, but I'm really here for evidence. I'm an investigator and I want evidence, okay? And that's why I made an offering right now. I'm giving you that offering. You got 16 minutes. 16 minutes. Okay. After our isolations, we split up into two groups. Eric and I did another séance session on the second floor because of what I experienced in our first séance. Meanwhile, Joe and Billy were in the basement conducting EVP sessions. -Now, I've started, okay. -Rolling? Alright. We're about to head upstairs. Matt and me are going to do a little séance action. Me and him had some good results with it last night. Now it's going to be just him and me. We're going to focus for however long it takes because we know something's up there. We know they're trying to come through. -You ready for this? -Yes, I am. -Me too. I'm excited. -I'm ready. I like this kind of thing because like-- Like you're saying, like we feel it. Like, I really-- I was really feeling it last night. -It was building up. -Yeah. Judging from the experiences we had, Eric and I were in the most active part of the house, so I decided to do something different and completely open myself up to the entity there. I wanted no barriers between me and whatever is in the house, hoping the house would speak to me. I'm letting it affect me in any way it likes. This is something I don't usually do, but Jason's warning made me want to. Alright, so we're focusing on you. We're focusing our energy, our passion, our drive, our desires and our will to communicate, we're focusing it all on you so that we can come through and talk to us. -I didn't hear anything. -I did not. We have the rem pod here, if you touch that. I know that you're here. What do you think of Matt? If you're here, don't be afraid to reach out. I know Matt was intense earlier, but he was just trying to look out for you. I was just trying to protect people from being affected again and stand up from what's evil. All the good ones. I'm completely open and accept you. Dude! Hello. You don't have to hide back there. -You can walk over here. -Yeah. Completely open and accept you. -Dude! -Accept you. Dude! What do you think of me? What do you think of Matt? I guess, I heard his name. Matt. Can you hear it? Yeah, I can sense it. -Right there. -Yeah, sounds like Matt. It's something. I mean, it sounds like Matt, but-- It does. We should probably go chill with them. -Do our last push. -Hurrah. Yeah, we're going to have to call it. We're going to refocus our energy on you. On the spirits here. It's me again. And that was Matt saying, "It's me again." I keep seeing the woods but with like a tombstone. I keep seeing a shadow. -Where at? -I mean, in my mind. -In your mind? -Behind me. Alright, let me try to look behind you as well. Okay, alright. There is 100% something behind you. I tried looking at it like meditation wise, like pastural wise, and there was immediately this gigantic, like, dark, greyish, like -just energy. -One second. I'm seeing little maggots from the room bottom. I'm seeing, like little red dots, like little red specks flashing. Whoa. That's them. That's them. That's Bill. So you said there's something behind Matt. That there's something else in here. Can you confirm? Are those both correct? I hear those noises are Billy downstairs moving. Just for notation. You know, when I was doing the séance part, you know what I was envisioning? What did you see? Woah! Is that what you saw? No, what did you see? I saw a shadow behind me, I was getting dragged into that room back there. That's freaky. The middle room? -The rocking chair -Mm-hmm. Spirits, did you see something similar to that? Matt getting dragged into the room? Leave now. -Leave now. -Leave now. -Leave now. -Matthew. -Bro, we-- -Matthew. That was so cool. That's a "Leave Now." It's so clear. Why should we leave? Please elaborate. I feel so drawn to that area. Take a camera. Get it, whatever it is. The deal. -The deal. -Stop. The deal. -The deal. -Stop. Come on, hold it. God damn. Whoa! Like now? I heard Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Yo, Billy. Can you come up here with us? It's pretty lit. Matt. -Matt? -Matt. We were doing an EVP session down there -and I was asking -Bathsheba. what they thought of all of us. -Bathsheba. -I said, What do you think--" Bathsheba! Damn, surely that got it. Had to have... I can't believe he shut the door. Yo, you alright? What happened? Did he pass out or something? Are you recording? What's up? You alright? What happened, big dog? I'm going to get some air. -Wait. -I'm going to get some air. Okay, follow him. Are you getting all that? I got it all. Yeah, I want to get some air too. He was laying on his back there when I came through. We have to watch that camera because he was just sitting in there, right? Yeah, sitting on the floor. He was laying right flat on his back. Where did he go? Oh, shit. There's no freaking light whatever the hell's this thing. Where the hell did he go? What a hero! He's entered the cemetery? What happened to Matt? Did you do something to Matt? You smell that? -Smells like wood burning. -Yeah. Yeah, I definitely smell that. It's burning wood. That's strange since we haven't smelled that since we've been here. Right. You okay? They're not in here. -I really don't know. -You got the talkie? Matt was lying like a dead man up there. Are they in there? I don't know. Here's my walkie. Where are you guys at? There you are. You alright? I was just zoned out. Like... I felt the terror from the Perrons, or at least one of them. I think it was one of them I was really feeling and... I felt, like, suffering from someone else, not me at that time and... I completely zoned out. I was following to the certain areas of the top floor and I was completely losing, like completely losing my equilibrium. And I almost cried at one point from feeling her emotions. And that's weird because they're alive, you know, they're alive, they're not dead or anything. Yeah, but I felt like I was feeling someone-- someone from a family that was here or something, which makes no sense. Their emotions-- Dude that makes perfect sense. Their emotions are probably still here. Imagine all they went through, you know? And at one-- When we were doing that-- We were doing that focusing and then you got up and just walked off. You felt something. Oh, my God and that was also the vision of being dragged in there. Yeah. And then you go in there and then you get dragged into a trance. You get dragged deep -into those emotions. -I was so in a trance. I have never had that in my whole life. I have never had that ever in my whole entire life felt that way in a location. It took you deep into that emotion. That's wild, dude. So you do feel it was external? It was-- I felt like I was being guided into there. And then I felt that person, I don't know which one it was, I just felt that-- their emotions and I-- and I almost-- It was-- I can't explain it, to be honest. It's hard to explain in words what the fuck happened. Dude, so from where we were, it sounded like you fell. I fell twice. Yeah and we-- So we got up and we're like, "What the hell?" The thing is like, I was-- And then when you started talking-- I didn't black out. I was just in a trance. I was going to say, when you first said something, it sounded like you weren't here, you were spaced out like, in a way deep trance. The moment you said something I knew like you were-- You had just come from somewhere else, is what it sounded like. I felt like I was in a completely different time period, like different situation, like, you guys are away from me. I'm like, not even-- It's hard to explain in words, to be honest. So this is something that's never happened to me before. I've been oppressed before, like a couple of times, but that was just feeling their emotions. But this was a trance, I've never been in trance like this before. I've never been, like, drawn and-- And losing my complete balance and falling-- How do you feel now? I feel better, like being out of the house. Fresh air. Dude. -Well, hey. -That's crazy. Now that I know you're okay, fist bump because that was badass. You just experienced something way deep. That was very deep. I've had oppression before, like, feeling someone's emotions, but I've never been in a trance like that. And I felt like time stood still. One of the things that I need you to understand is that, you know, when you push, like you did earlier with the provocation and such, you know, it also kind of puts us all in a little bit of danger, too. But at the same time, just because nothing happens here doesn't mean it won't happen at your home. I knew that. I knew that. That could also affect us as well. Mm-hmm, I'm aware. -I'm-- -But I specifically said, the invitation's for me and I got what I wanted. That's what I wanted. It's not all physical. It's-- Most of this is psychological. And we have to be careful. -And spiritual. -I know. But to be honest, I kind of liked it. Like, I want that more. My goal from challenging the entity was to invoke a reaction. Whatever is necessary. As an investigator, I want evidence, but at the same time I do not like when an entity is taking advantage of someone. Why can't I take the blows when I ask for it instead of people like the Perron family? And she knows this and he told her after that he would never put her through anything like that again. And she believed her and I think aside from "I love you," I think the most you most powerful words in this or any language are, "I believe you." I understand you wouldn't-- I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads up on this but I thought this was a really important story to share with people. I do want to-- I want you to do good with if you could, honey. That was that one that... I got lucky and I got an interaction back, which doesn't always happen. Judging from all the correlations, I was a target since the beginning. I am glad I was. I wish this would happen to me at all locations I investigate. I wouldn't mind them follow me home either. I want paranormal phenomena to manifest as much as possible in my life. This is what I signed up for. When we arrived back home, Joe and I spent hours reviewing our findings. After reviewing the footage, we still did not know what was causing the walkie-talkie interference, and we wanted to try one more time to recreate the chair movement with our new knowledge of where Billy stepped when the rocking chair initiates. From when we examined the DVR footage frame by frame. So Joe and I decided to head back to Harrisville, Rhode Island, and our good friend, Levy Reyes, invited us to join him at the Farmhouse. Alright, so this has been one hell of a drive. The weather is bad, the roads are bad. This is insane. Upon trying to debunk the walkie talkie interference with Cory, we discovered no interference could be duplicated. Hey, Joe, it's not doing it any more. Yeah, there's nothing here. Okay, so channel three is on right now. This is exactly-- You didn't change anything with your security cameras -or anything like that? Nothing? -No. Because that's what we were probably thinking of is do you have any wireless stuff with your security cameras? -No. -No, you don't? It's all-- Okay. I'm on Channel three right now, look. Ten, three. Okay, it's three. Same channel. It was happening all the time in this area, now it's not happening. They changed out their DVR system. They said they didn't. Didn't you change it out, like get a new system? We got a new system coming in. Like Ethernet. Huh. This doesn't make sense. It was going crazy on Channel Three. What the heck? Why can't we recreate it now? It was going insane. So you didn't do any new things electrically? It is on if it helps. Like, I was thinking it was gonna be easy to recreate again because we were able to recreate it over and over again when we were there. But now, if you didn't change anything electrically... -No. -That's kind of weird. Since Cory states, he has not changed anything electrically at the house, a natural explanation couldn't be found for what we experienced that night with the walkie-talkies. Okay, so right now we are back about nine, ten months later after the original footage when we captured the chair moving. Bill, after reviewing the footage, we noticed he steps exactly at this crack right here and we want to know approximately the distance that he was when he stepped from the chair. As you can tell, the stubs right here are very short. So he obviously did not step on the stub to accidentally make this go like that. And so what we're going to do is measure about the distance. So if he stepped right around here and they'll say his foot probably was-- Let's use my boots for Yeah, let's use your boot for an example. Yeah. This is an estimation obviously. He probably has a bigger foot or smaller foot, we don't know. -These are a 12, so-- -Put your foot here. Put it where exactly? Right there is fine. So estimation. Well, I was right about a foot. A little bit over a foot, 13 inches from where he's standing right here. And that's when this moved. Now, back up. 13 inches away approximately. Probably the same for Bill. And look at this. It doesn't even move. It doesn't budge at all. Not even a little bit. So that right there is some amazing evidence. I'm pretty excited about this one. The cool thing about this is how many angles we have when this happens. We have about, I think four cameras or so and plus DVR cameras and all that. That's a lot of cameras running at the moment. And we had a live stream going, which was Eric's live stream when it happened. Like, I have a 4K camera, multiple-- A couple 4K cameras, literally pointing at the chair right after it happens. It's extremely obvious there's no string and we're-- Literally with the lights on, you will be able to see that string if there was one so... I think this is classified as paranormal without a doubt. The next morning when I was transferring SD cards and packing up our gear to get ready to leave, all of a sudden I heard water running in the restroom. There was no one in there and I was the only one awake at the time. Joe? Paranormal experience. Okay, so this was not caught on camera. Somebody in here? It has a lot of force. You need a lot of force to that to move it. It's not loose. The Hollywood film, The Conjuring. Overdramatized and embellishes what actually happened. But the question we wanted answered was, is the infamous Harrisville Farmhouse truly that next level haunted location? From the evidence we captured, including our personal experiences, we can conclude the house is definitely more active than most locations we have investigated. It was The Conjuring that brought our truth to light and gave me the opportunity to tell the world that yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. I know what some might think after watching this documentary, is the footage we captured truly real? -It's moving. It's moving. -Move. Move-- Was it all a hoax for a film? Psychologist Leon Festinger said it best. What he is talking about is a psychological theory called cognitive dissonance. "Psychological conflict resulting from incongruous beliefs and attitudes held simultaneously." In other words, what we presented in this documentary is 100% real. Like the lighting because they're like, you know how like the-- The-- -These things are-- -Right there. Oh, shit! Wow. -Dude. -That's why I was like, oh shit. -Look at this. -That's badass, dude. -Yeah. -And look how fast it stopped. Yeah. But no matter how much evidence we present towards paranormal phenomenon, many will deny it. Cognitive dissonance can be a problem among sceptics and believers. As a paranormal investigator, I try my best to be unbiased and present our findings through the art of film. Is there any experiences that you've had or any of your family members for mimicking, like mimicking other people. Yes. -Oh, really? -Yes. Oh, okay. Let's go in depth with that. Bathsheba came through-- Well, a few years ago, I was doing a spirit bath session and I was working with my paranormal partner at the time, George Lopez, and she came through with my voice. And he said, "No, no, no, no. You don't use Andrea's voice, you use your own voice or we can't have this conversation." And then she came through with that child-like voice that I recognized. And I heard a little girl say, "Daddy." I was feeling very disoriented. Yes, and I-- Someone being terrified of something, just complete terror is what I felt. Well, there was an incident that occurred when my sister Cindy was 14, where a black mass that she saw hovering above me in bed swept down off of me and grabbed her by the ankles and dragged her down, partially down the bedroom stairs. The bedroom that was my bedroom, right, directly above the parlour. Wow. I didn't even know this story. That's really intriguing. Wow. So that was my vision of being dragged also by a shadowy mass and-- Cindy was terrified out of her mind that night. -Terrified! -Wow. Okay, I might have felt her. I am not making the bold claim that what we encountered here is without a doubt, ghosts. But objects are being moved on their own here. Fucking shit! Holy shit! Oh, my God. Yeah. What the fuck! It was all over the place. Holy shit, dude. And that is truly paranormal phenomena. Something we don't exactly understand yet and defies our known laws of physics. Science always changes. One day we might have some of the answers, but until then, we keep searching. Matt, every time somebody like you goes into that house with the owner's permission and has their own experiences in there, and what you do serves to vindicate and validate my family's story. Every time you compile more and more evidence, it serves to validate our story.
