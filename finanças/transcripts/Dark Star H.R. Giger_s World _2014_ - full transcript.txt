HR GIGER'S WORLD This is the oldest skull I have. My father gave it to me. It was sent to us by Ciba-Geigy. I was around six years old at the time. It did scare me a little. To hold death in your hands like that is... Well, it's not very pleasant. So I pulled it along the street on a piece of string. I guess I wanted to prove that I wasn't scared of death. What's so fascinating is his incredible sense of perception. An incredibly keen sense of perception. He has this ability to probe deeper into the human soul than most people. You see his pictures and feel like you've known them forever. They represent the deepest depths of our souls. Paul's here. Hello, Mr Giger! Hello. -Hi there. I called you. -How are you? -Good, thanks. Yes, exactly. Hi. -Hello. Happy? That's good. Hello. -Are you okay? Hi, Roger. -Hello. This is Mr Grof. Stanislav. That's just great. We can discuss everything in detail later. They're ideas from the graphic designer. There's the cover too. The book will be in German and English. That's the idea for the cover. And from that page on, you have examples of the content. You can have a look. Take a look. This is how it would look. They're just ideas. They'll need a bit more Work. This one isn't bad. -It just needs to be lighter there. PSYCHIATRIST / AUTHOR These ones here are really great. They're the best I've seen so far. -True. Sorry'? -You want to use all of them'? We already agreed on that: to make ten different ones. Okay. So he can sell these over there. We added a silver base to these two here. It'll have a much finer finish. That one too. Only those two will have a silver base. Does it have to be black there? I'd use White. Well, I really like that old-style patina. POSTER DESIGNER Waking up can be a bitter experience sometimes. Especially if you're having an erotic dream and you haven't finished dreaming yet. And you desperately try to get back into your dream. But you rarely manage to carry on dreaming. Pretty much everyone has dreams, but very few people actually dare to tell people about them or to try and depict them because of their inhibitions. As you go through life, all sorts of things come to mind. Some of these ideas ended up in The Passages series. They were based on dreams I'd had that were so frightening I found it hard to breathe. This is something that's reflected very strongly in my Work. His sister took him to The Raetian Museum. There was a mummy there, clown in the basement. He was really scared, but his sister Iris laughed at him. This really got to him and Wounded his childish pride. So in the encl, he went there on his own every Sunday to look at the mummy. It's part of Hansruedi's character: he doesn't stop until he's reached his goal. Either he loses his fear or he draws until he gets it right. He keeps on and on until he's overcome his fear. It's obvious that this experience had a huge impact on him because it's present in all of his Work. The feminine and the sublime. The figure of the princess. Then you have the mummy: that's the Egyptian element. And then you have death: the bones and sense of eternity inherent in death. I find the pictures erotic. Firstly, they're beautiful images and secondly, I see the pictures as a kind of magical depiction of a primal force. The phallus isn't really the focal point. The pictures have this immense energy, which makes them incredibly striking. Hansruedi has a great talent for this. I-le knows how to position things, how to use symbols. If I ask him, "What does that mean?", he says, "I just liked the Way it looked. It works well." Hansruedi has had various assistants over the years. I have the immense honour to be one of them. It's always been like that in this house. You deal with so many people from around the world, and so many different topics: they'd never manage on their own. We treated Giger's Necronomicon like a bible back then. Hi, Hansruedi. -Hello. Do you know about this? -Yes. I was 19 or 20 and people here in Switzerland just laughed at us. We were making really radical music. MUSICIAN AND ASSISTANT There was no extreme metal scene. There Weren't many bands that sounded like us. I Wrote to him in my scrawly handwriting and told him What his art meant to us. I found his address in the telephone book, sent it off and never thought I'd hear back. And then, to my surprise, he called me. He said he'd heard our music and could see the connection. The record labels never took us seriously. They said we had no chance: it was just noise. The only person who took us seriously was this guy who had just won an Oscar: HR Giger. He took it seriously and became our mentor back then. It meant so much to us. I've often... It's 30 years ago now and I've often tried to tell him What that meant to us. But it's hard to put it into words. I hope he's realised it by now. What he did for us back then was extremely generous, a really kind gesture. How important I am for Tom? We're important for each other. Wouldn't you say? -it's really great to hear that. Müggi Good cat. Yes. Anything else you need me to do? No, I don't really need anything. Hello. Hello. Just a moment. I'm going to get changed. It took me ages to find it! A Linzer Torte. It still has this Wonderful old machine. Here's a slice for you, Hansruedi. It's pear. At least it's looking good for once. Where did you get that? I recently told someone that Mr Giger was married to my daughter. People are often curious when they hear that. Not so much now, but back then, they'd ask, "What's he like as a husband?" They think he must be... They see his pictures and think of porn or something. I said, "No, of course not! He's just a normal guy." "No, no, no!" They just see his paintings and... People asked me questions like that. But of course other people would say, "I love his paintings!" I'd say 50 percent love his paintings and the other half either say nothing or they don't like them. But... But my family in Spain are huge fans! All of them. They tell me, "We saw Hansruedi on Spanish television!" We have a lot of dealings with Twentieth Century Fox. Simply because... We have to keep track of the money. Income and expenditure. It was so chaotic here at first. Things scattered all over the place. But you just get used to it and it somehow becomes normal. Would you like something to drink while you finish up there? No, I'm nearly done. Twentieth Century Fox has written to us again. Let's wait and see how they respond. You know how mac! it makes me. -Yes. Over there, for example, you see the triptych of birth, life and death. Babies represent birth, then there's life. And then skulls for death. And the punk group Dead Kennedys chose this image for their album and they were taken to court. The curious thing about this story is that at the beginning of the trial, the jury obviously didn't realise that it was a painting and thought it was a photograph. Who knows how you'd take a photo like that! He's painted a lot of Native American babies with feathers. And all of these babies really look like Hansruedi. The babies have his eyes, cheeks, forehead. You can really see his facial features. What shall I say? Shall l... -The Ringel painting? No, your oil painting. -Oh, my painting... You can say it was the result of an LSD trip. Can I say that? -Yes. Oh, excellent. Great. As you can see, the shapes are twisted and distorted. It was inspired by one of his LSD trips. I should add that he didn't go oh many of these "journeys". And here we have a raven. In alchemy "nigredo", which means "blackness", is one of the first and most important steps in the process: it signifies introspection, looking Within at the dark night of the soul. Hansruedi's art has the same effect as "nigredo". You have to come face-to-face with your dark side before you can seek the light. What I like about Hansruedi is he has his finger on the pulse. He's like a seismograph, absorbing the Waves around him. We were together for nine years. And during this time, a lot of things from this relationship found their Way into my images. It's still hard to talk about it. I certainly loved and adored her very much. And you can see that in the pictures. I do think that the atmosphere at home was laden with the contradictions of Catholicism. Ll TOBLER'S BROTHER Of an extremely puritanical upbringing. That's how it was. And on the other hand, this World she suddenly became part of, Where everything was permitted and there were no taboos. This caused her huge psychological and emotional problems. So many things were bad and forbidden. So many things were impure... and reprehensible. And then if you discover a different side to yourself and try to... balance these two Worlds Within yourself: it's extremely hard. We loved each other and we were good together. But she sometimes suffered from bad depression. And I didn't seem to be able to help her much... with my painting. It was Whit Monday. My dad woke me up that morning and told me that Li had died. For our mother, who was a strict Catholic, suicide was one of the worst things you could do. You couldn't even be buried in a graveyard then. And... I Went to see Hansruedi. And I can still remember going into the room and seeing the mattress she'd been lying on. Then we Went to the police station with the gun she'd used. We handed it over and then Went back to the flat. And then we Went to the room upstairs that I showed you. There was a big note on the floor and on it she'd Written, "Adieu." When she died it was obviously an immense shock for me. It was an overwhelming experience. I can't put it into words. At the beginning, I felt like I'd never be able to cope with it. But after a while, I started painting again and that helped me to... How can I put it? Distance myself somewhat... from her death. And then, of course, I had this feeling that something could have been done. The fear that maybe you're responsible for the death of your partner: it's a horrific experience. He rang me and said, "Quit your job. Hollywood just called." EX-WIFE AND FORMER ASSISTANT I thought it was a joke. But he said some people from Hollywood were coming round the day after tomorrow to talk about a film. He said he needed me. He shoved this camera at me, a thing like this, and told me to film. But I barely knew how to operate the thing! It was these eggs where the aliens lie in wait. I had some problems with the producers. Because the designs I'd come up With... I'd modelled the eggs myself. They found the opening a little obscene. It looked too much like a vagina. They Wanted to screen the film in Catholic countries, so I had to try and create a cross shape, rather than a crack. So that's What I did. Now they're doubly obscene, specially for the Catholic church. We were in Dallas, and it was incredibly hot. Hansruedi was having a cold bath. Then we got a call from reception: a journalist Wanted to talk to Mr Giger. I said I was sorry but he was unavailable at the moment. Hansruedi said, "You talk to him, you know all about it anyway." So I said I'd talk to him. So I said, "He Wants to talk to you. You have to make some time later." Then Hansruedi sat up in the bath and smacked his hands on the water, making it spray everywhere, and said, "We're marrying when we get home! Then you're not a groupie and they'll talk to you!" That was his proposal. I'd contracted Hepatitis C in hospital, but no one realised it at the time. And I was really sick. And Hansruedi just didn't know how to deal with it. One day, he was sitting at my bed and he put it very bluntly, "If you're sick, I can't Work and when I can't work, I go crazy." PSYCHIATRIST / AUTHOR His paintings depict a lot of the fears and realities we face in this World. MUSICIAN AND ASSISTANT if you ask me Why I claim to understand it all so Well... If you look at my childhood, you'll see I had a lot of problematic experiences. That's probably Why I'm so in touch with this dark side. Darkness isn't negative: it's an endless source of fascination. It's quite literally endless. It's fascinated me for 50 years and I can't see an end to it yet. So Hansruedi's art is... It's like a bridge to my own images and emotions. Have you left a spot for me? It's like a separate universe, a microcosm, like nothing you've ever experienced before. Hansruedi often just goes off somewhere in the house. It's big enough for him to disappear into one of its nooks and crannies and become part of it. This house is almost like a living being. And he's part of it. If he Wants to be seen, you'll find him. If not, you Won't. PLEASE PUT ALL TOOLS BACK WHERE THEY BELONG DON'T LEAVE DIRTY DISHES IN THE SINK HRG IS A SHOCKING EXAMPLE OF HOW IT SHOULD NOT END UP. THANK YOU! I have copies. You can keep these. I'll go with your mum then. We have a letter... I couldn't leave you on your own. LINZ AUSTRIA Let's go UP- I'm afraid we haven't got too much time. It's almost 6 and the openings at 7, Where everyone's eagerly awaiting you. Take some time to freshen up a bit and then... Is it okay if I pick you up? -Yes. You have to go to Lentos Art Museum. You'll see a barrier and you can get out there. Can you pay for the taxi? Hansruedi in the front? -Yes. Hello. The museum is shaped like a long bar. It's like a gate... Now we're walking behind the space. The fact that he divides the established art scene and popular culture... CURATOR is also due to the particular dynamics of these fields. He Worked on a Hollywood film and suddenly had huge success across the World. He only had a small following before and suddenly everyone knew him. And the momentum of this popularity didn't fit well with the structure of the art scene. At least not at the end of the 1970s. The scene is structured differently today. And the passing of time smooths over certain rifts. So in the last decade, it's been possible for Hansruedi Giger to make a gradual comeback onto the art scene. Unlike many people, I don't believe Hansruedi's Work merely explores our dark side. I'd almost go so far as to say that even in his darkest images, light shines through. That even when he invents creatures that are devoid of all goodness, he's able to look through to the other side, as it were, and imagine a universe Where both forces exist. There's no doubt that the cycle of birth, sexuality and death is the central motif of his entire oeuvre. A lot of artists explore these themes, but with Hansruedi Giger, they're very closely entwined. In his case, we have images that depict death and birth, eros and thanatos, coming together as one. He's shaped and plagued by fears, but also feels mysteriously drawn to the abyss and the uncanny. I'd say he's not alone there. Many of us feel like this, but he's discovered a Way to find this place and he's made himself at home there. He clearly doesn't go back and forth, like some people do, who dive in, re-emerge and then dive in again and survive this process or come out damaged the other side. He's made himself at home there. He feels most at ease surrounded by the uncanny. He feels at home in places we run from in fear. Müggi, Müggi... This is next on my list. I'll put it here. The packaging is always so fiddly. Here's the next one for you. And here's the next. You can just close the cover. I'll go and let Roland in. Hang on, I'll be back in a minute. Here's the middle one... Then we're clone. -.Just goes to show. In the end, What it looks like is more important than What's inside. No! There are great things inside and it looks good. We have both. So, we've done the first lot. Okay? -Yes, that's great. We'll carry on... He always Wanted to be independent and didn't want to hire a manager. These days, I do a lot of the work, from organising exhibitions to helping with the sales. I help him out Wherever he needs it. ASSISTANT, CURATOR AND ARCHIVIST He belongs to the war generation: he keeps everything and has lots of stuff. But the great thing is, if you look through his stuff 20, 30 years later, you find some fascinating things, like this picture. I found it tucked away down there. An early sketch he did: Doctor Cinderella's Plants, Hansruedi Giger, 10.12.1960. There's so much hidden away in this house that no one's ever seen. It's like rummaging through a treasure trove. What would you like? Cake. -Cake! Okay. Did you make it? -Yes, I baked it this morning. Fabulous! I haven't tried it yet either. Enjoy! Good. -it's not bad. Each moment was unique here. FORMER PARTNER AND ASSISTANT I was never bored. Life here was anything but normal. His socks and underpants were in the oven. In the bathtub, you'd find his books piled high. I said to Hansruedi, "I'm moving the books. I have a cold and need to have a bath." That's when I started to tidy up and create a library system. Whenever I tidied up, Hansruedi got new ideas. One morning, I got here and there was an awful stench! There was this skull lying in the bathtub. I think it was an ibex with long horns. Hansruedi had put it in there to soak. It was in the bath and it was so revolting! It was normal to come home and find a lion skeleton in front of the door. I could hardly get in. He needed the spine to create Sil, the creature with a lion's spine. Hansruedi Worked with Americans a lot and he had to talk on the phone, so that meant Working at night. So we didn't start Work until the afternoon. But I really need light. And in Hansruedi's house everything is painted black, his pictures are everywhere, and the shutters are closed, so no light can get through. At some point, after many, many months, I opened the shutters, the light came in and I saw the sun. Then he came upstairs, had a look and said, "The shutters are open." I said, "Yes, it's daytime. That's when you open the shutters. At night, you close them again." He looked at me and Walked off Without saying a word, and I was so happy. I had some light again. Marco's really tidied up. The basement looks great. It's all sorted by product. -Yes. Not like it used to be round here, right? Can't you find anything? It was never really shipshape around here. Never. It bothers me a little sometimes. I don't recognise my basement anymore. -I didn't recognise it either. Everything is so tidy. Box after box of lithography... So bourgeois! -What? Bourgeois? Terrible! That's tidying up for you! FOPPA, FLIMS, SWISS ALPS Hello, hello! No, you can't drive any further. You'll have to park here. We'll give him a hand. -Hi! Hansruedi inherited the houses from his parents. After divorcing, we Worked together for a long time. He really valued my Work and in return he gave me the house. Make sure you Walk on the slabs. The mist is... Just like it was 20 years ago. Exactly. It's still there. The people of Flims just love it! Watch your head! Nice. Very nice. Well done. You guys did a great job. You're looking good. -Thanks. You fit perfectly into... -Into the surroundings? I remember that basket very well. We've kept it there for the Wood. As a child, I spent all of my holidays here. In the Winter and summer holidays, we always came here. Together with my sister at first. I always think if I show my pictures to my father or mother, it'll scare them to death. It's funny that even though I'm so free, I always Wonder What they think of me when I paint pictures like that. But I'm their child, so What I do is completely natural. It comes from somewhere. He has his mother's imagination. -Yes. His mother is very imaginative and easily scared. She sees ghosts and things like that. Is that so? -Yes, you're always... I'm easily scared, but I don't see ghosts. He had really great parents. His father was always a bit of an enigma to him. He was a very secretive person. He worked as a pharmacist and was a very respected figure in Chur. But he was closest to his mother. His mother supported him with his painting any Way she could. After he'd completed his first really good drawing, he showed her and she had it put in a golden frame. Hansruedi meant the World to her. They really loved each other and had a very strong connection. And she was very proud of him. It's also somehow... His mother could have been so different: outraged by the things he painted. Nothing of the sort: she was just so proud and happy that her son had made it so far. MÜGGI III Ill When we got together he'd just set up the railway in the garden. He'd drive around it and shout, "Make way! Make way!" So he's very... young at heart. Watch out here or you might get the doors in your face. Müggi, get out of the way! Müggi! In the garden he built the railway he'd dreamt of as a child. DIRECTOR, HR GIGER MUSEUM He managed to realise all of his dreams. The narrow sections here on this side... So here's the floor plan. That's the middle section. The arch will go here and we'll put something in there. We'll use these slats to join the inside parts together. And they'll be fixed here, a whole load of slats. There are more expensive coatings. With marble, for example. But this one is very special. Whenever he has money, he invests it in something. He does something with it, some sculptures, or the fountain in the garden. And he's certainly been lucky: he's always had just enough. And enough to do some really great things. He was lucky enough to inherit a few plots of land from his parents. He gradually sold them off, which made it possible to build the bar. The bar is Worth a fortune. It was a very expensive business. And each time we were always down to our very last cent and we just made it. There was nothing left over. We just pulled it off. And the Way we live now, we just about scrape by. But What else do we need? We should be able to secure it somewhere! It's not secured. Or what are these things...'? It needs to be attached in the middle. There we go! We need one of those oh the other side. Pull it in! It's totally different now. I'll do it this Way. That's not how you sit at a bar. If you look at his childhood drawings, you'll see that he liked drawing ruins and especially castles. As a small boy, he always Wanted to be the lord of the castle. And he got both in the end: he has a museum and there's his castle, his Château St. Germain. That's really great. Looks like it, doesn't it? It's completely full inside. And in the garden. Really? Great. Did everything go to plan? -Yes! Hi. -Hi, Hansruedi. Hi, everyone. Very brave! I know how you like it. Thank you, Master! Müggi: M-Ü-G-G-l. He Wanted to know What the cat was called. Wow! Well done! He's bought things back over the years for several times the price he got back then. He had a feeling there'd be a museum one day. So he kept or bought back all of his most important works long before there was even any talk of a museum. The Spell Room is my favourite space. The aluminium alloy is cast in vast, chilled moulds. It is then transformed into a thin, smooth layer used to clad aeroplanes. I think that when you die, that's the end. I don't think you live on after death or have another life after death. No! I wouldn't enjoy that. Having to plough through all that again... No, I don't want to do that. I've seen everything I wanted to see. Everything I wanted to do or show, I've done it. I don't need any more than that. I'm happy with What I've done. There you go! Phew! Is there a seating plan? I'll just sit here. -Or we'll have another Battle of Sempach! Do you know which...? Oh, you're taking some of ours. Hansruedi "HR" Giger died shortly after the end of the shoot on 12 May 2014 BABELFISCH TRANSLATIONS Rebekah Smith
