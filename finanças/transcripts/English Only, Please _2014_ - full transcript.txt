My name is… Be quiet, I’m applying for a job. Sorry. My name is Drander Bumangit, a.k.a. Antidote from Tandang Sora, Quezon City. Hi. I am Bill. Bill what? Bill. Good evening, Judges. Standing before you is Pia Gumamela Sampaguita Guanio, from the four corners of Project 8. Maria Anita Dimasalang, 36 years old. I have been teaching English for the past 5 years. So I’m Emerald Green, 24 years old, and I’ve been to New York City. My name is Rafael Brion, I am a literature professor in a prime university here in Manila. I finish Welding. Welding? Welding at the technical center. Hi Sir, I’m Teresa Madlangsacay. I'm an English tutor at your service. Hi. I need this letter to be translated from English to Filipino, can you do that? Sure! Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. What’s that, Sir? Of course, Sir. Just give me a shoot whenever you can. Yes. Yes, Sir. Hi, Liar. You are a slut. You are the worst, most ridiculous thing that has happened to me. I regret every single second I spend with you. I gave you my all. I gave you my life. I gave you everything. I gave you my everything. I even gave you a dog. A dog. You lying, cheating, gold-digging bitch. I will hunt you down and I hope you burn in hell. I gave everything... I gave everything. You are... a slut... whatchamacallit. Wait. This is too much. It’s so hard to live when no one loves you. Sir, you’re a bit too fast. Just add me on Facebook, send me that message and I’ll translate it. Live, Sir. Umm... With that, Sir, I’ll be happy to be in second place, Sir! I.. resign, Sir. Hi, you lying woman. You are a slut. I gave you my all. I even gave you a dog. A dog, you beast! Don’t come to my neighborhood, I’ll have you beaten, I swear. Shameless hussy, I’ve never loved like this before, then you hurt me like this. You just left with no explanation, like you never loved me, even a little. As if I couldn’t do anything to stop you. If you only knew how painful it is, you couldn’t handle it. Don’t come to my street or I’ll have you beaten by the drunks on the corner. You don’t know how much a heart in pain wants revenge. You have no idea. End of translation, Sir. You’re hired. - Hi, Tere! Come, in! - Hi, mommy! Sorry I’m late, heavy traffic on Edsa. It's okay. Take a seat. I'll call them. Thank you. Alms, alms. Spare me a piece of bread. Spare me your... Spare me your mercy. Spare me your mercy. Hi. Sorry, heavy traffic on Edsa. It’s okay. Wait, I'll come back. I think we have to review the subject-verb agreement again. For example, "The girl... The girl is... A tramp. Sorry, girlfriend, traffic... Girlfriend? I’m here. Hi, how are you? Well, actually, I’m fine, thank you. How about you? - Very good. - Oh gosh, you know, I'm so intelligent! Mr. Julian! Welcome! Hi. English only, please. I'm Tere, your tutor. Welcome to the home of Manny Pacquiao, Bruno Mars, Jessica Sanchez, Lou Diamond Phillips and Robin Williams, the beautiful islands of the Philippines! You’re full of energy, huh. But I don’t think Robin Williams is from the Philippines. No, just the wife. So what’s the plan? Let’s get a cab. Let’s go! No, I got it. This way, Sir. How was your flight, Sir? Horrible. You know what? I’m really excited to be working with you. I deal with a lot of foreign students learning to speak English, but your case is the exception. It’s kind of hard to find a Filipino translator, actually. I hope you don’t mind, but are you Filipino? You look Filipino but don’t speak our language. I didn’t grow up in a Filipino environment. Oh. I see. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure to introduce you to our language, culture, while you’re here. I’m not here to learn the language or culture, I just need a few words translated. There’s a lot of online dictionaries or translation services. You could’ve hired someone on the Web instead of coming here, right? I just need my speech to be translated so I can recite it to someone. Can you help me with that? Then you’ve hired the right person. Perfect, that’s great. Is it a declamation piece, or... I’m really, really hungry, could we go get some food and I’ll explain this to you. - Sure, let’s go. - Great. Thank you so much. I got it. - After you. - Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Driver, take us to Pulang Daan. Hi, Sister! Eat slowly or you might choke. - Give me one of those, and that... - Trey... Trey... What are we doing here? We will eat Filipino food, Sir. I want real food. This is real food! Intestines. Yes, Sir. We eat everything, even the blood, Sir. Okay, this is for me. Now this is real food, Terry, not that crap you’re trying to feed me. What? Are you gonna stare at me while I eat? You’re from New York, Sir, right? Yes. How’s the weather there? Is it cold? I really want to go there. Beyonce, you know Beyonce? I wanna see Beyonce! Terry, I’m sorry to burst your bubble, but I can’t and won’t bring you to the US. It’s okay. Just seeing you is like being in the US. I don’t understand what you’re saying? Sir, it’s TeRE, accent on the second syllable. Tere Madlangsacay. Let’s get down to business, okay? Your job is to translate this letter to Filipino, and make me recite it like a real Filipino in 30 days or less. Can you do that? Hey. I want it dark, bitter and strong. What did life do to you? Wanna talk about it, Sir? Look, I’ll give you 1,000 dollars for the entire tutorial service. 20 percent downpayment on the first day, then the remaining balance every few sessions after within 30 days. 1,000 dollars? 43,000 pesos to teach you Tagalog? This is weird. Are you on drugs, brother? What are you talking about? Drugs? I mean 43,000 pesos for a tutorial service? Are you sure? It’s just a thousand dollars, what’s the big deal? I think it’s too much, but thank you! Okay. Any other questions? Sir, who wrote this letter? Aside from that. I guess we’re done here, then. I’ll see you soon, okay? Okay. See you, babe. What does that mean? It’s “see you” in Filipino. Bye. Kitty-kits, beh. 2. When you want to say babe but have some shame. Sorry, heavy traffic on Edsa. Been here long? I just got here. I texted you 30 minutes ago. You didn’t get stuck in Edsa traffic? No, traffic was light. The government’s really doing something. Babe, thanks for the cellphone. It’s nothing, just a small thing. What’s that? The 13-inch MacBook Air. 1.4 GHz, Intel core, all the specs. You want one? Sure. How much? 59,900… 59 thousand?! But it’s available in 4 installments. Free shipping in installments. It seems like a lot. What about the people fighting in Israel? There's war in Israel?! Don’t be mad. Good thing you’re so handsome. Just good-looking, not that handsome. Don’t worry, I’ll save up for it. Really? I’m so lucky with you. We’re not even official yet. Why can’t we make it official again? I’m in a bad position right now. I need to work on myself. It’s not you, it’s me. Okay. Willing to wait. Message: What’s taking so long? I have to go. What? Sorry, it’s an emergency. What emergency? Where are you going? I really have to go. Sorry. Sorry. Pay for the room, okay? Next time. Message: I got two Cokes from the refrigerator, pay for them, okay? Ma’am, Sir, your room is ready. Hi, are you alone? Rude! I’m Sofia. And I’m not interested. So what do you do? I stalk my ex-girlfriend. One seat left, it’s about to go! Just one! Who’s alone here? Someone solo, no boyfriend, husband, or relatives. Just one! Fine, it’s me! I’m alone! I’m the martyr so the jeep can leave! He'll leave you for sure. Message: I’m home. Miss you. Message: How are you,guys! This is my new roaming number. Send me a 300-peso credit so I can call you. I have an important message. I hate you, witches! Guys, have a snack. Thanks. - Girlfriend, this is Vincent. - Hi. She’s my best friend, Tere. You’ve told me about her. Father candidate # 521. I’m going to win! Yes, she’s my best friend. So smart, but stupid in love. That’s unfair. I’m not stupid, I just love too much. She’s really stupid. Yay, I win. I’m the best, you witches! I'm the winner! I met Vincent on Tinder. He looks better in his profile photo. But it’s fine. I know it’s inner beauty that matters. To be fair, she was thinner in her photo, but I like her in person. Much hotter. You’re compatible, then. Both your Tinder photos lie. Carry on. How’s your new student? He’s okay. Still cranky. So hostile. But handsome. Your type? Ewww! No! - "Ewww"? You think you're pretty? - She likes him! Fine, you’re pretty. But hello! "Ewww"? Enough of that. I love Rico. You love him, but does he love you? Mallows, keep your kid away from me. I have to go. Uncle Vincent, are you ready to be my father? Sorry, I have to go, too. What? Why? I have to avoid the traffic on Edsa. You live on the next corner, what traffic? I have to work on my painting. Ah, painting. For the exhibit. Art is calling. Take care! Love you. See you later. I'll be going now. I’m going to be abandoned again, aren't I? Forget that one. He won’t do. There’s so many guys out there. Says the person who can easily move on! That’s why we’re best friends! Take care. Bye, my student’s looking for me. Be a good girl. Bye! Mommy, it’s okay. He looks stinky anyway. Actually. And I feel that he’s gay. Hi, Sir, sorry I’m late. Traffic on Edsa. Yeah, you’re 47 minutes late. Whoa! You’re good at Math. No, I’m just on time. You know, Sir, there’s something called Filipino time. When your meeting is at 7pm, people will arrive at 7:15, 7: 25... And you arrived at 7:47, which means that even for Filipino time you’re late. That’s why I should’ve just said sorry. Look, lady... What’s your name again? Tere. If I set a meeting at 7, I expect you to be here at 7, whether or not you’re Filipino. Now please respect my time, because it’s not yours to waste. Waiter! Iced tea, lots of ice, for cooling down someone’s temper. - Here's iced tea to cool your head. - Thank you! Sir, before we start, I just want to ask you a few questions. For me to translate it accurately, to whom... Don’t ask. I just want to know... Don't ask. Okay, I should’ve just translated instead of snooping. Okay, let's start! “Hi, Liar.” You lying woman! “Hi, Liar” is two words, you just said a million words. Isn't it too long? The direct translation of “Hi” is “Kumusta” in Filipino. You only say that to a friend. In this letter, you’re angry? Don't ask. Fine, this letter’s angry. You will say “Hoy”. Hoy. More. Hoy! Hoy. Angrier. - Hoy! - Hoy. HOY! Turn it up! Hoy! You just bought coffee, not the whole coffee shop. Okay. Do this again. Hoy! You lying woman. You’re a slut and a whore. You are the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life. Really. Really. Thank you, Sir! Sir, thank you for this downpayment. - Don’t be late tomorrow, okay? - Yes, Sir! So. Kitty-kits, beh. See you, babe. - Taxi! - Taxi, Taxi! Go ahead. No, it’s yours. I insist. Go ahead. I’m from here, you’re my guest. Driver, don’t overcharge him. Take care of Handsome over here. I got your number! I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, Sir! Thank you. Mom! I’m sending you some money. For cementing the second floor and fixing the roof. Next week I’ll send money for Tina’s cellphone. Thank you, child. You're welcome, Mom. How’s work? It's fine. Good. I miss you. Love you, Mom. Bye! Mallows, right? Oh, my God! You look so much better. You are so stubborn. You give him everything, your soul included. Hi, I’m Tere Madlangsacay. Come on. He’s so lucky. He doesn’t do anything, yet he gets the new clothes, new phone, new laptop. You’re worse than those sugar-mommy queens. Why stop? Buy him a motorcycle. What are you talking about? He’s thinking about it. He loves me! Leave him alone! You haven’t been informed? They’re building a monument on Mendiola for your martyrdom. You’re invited to the ribbon-cutting. Mallows, please. How do I look? - Hey, kid. How cute! - Can we buy this? - Your daughter? - No. She's mine. Isn’t it cute? Where are you going? Wait. Surprise! Hey! This is the 11-inch Mac Air, I said I wanted the 13-inch. Mom called, I had to send money to my family, so I didn’t have enough money. If you really love me, you’ll give me what I want. The missing 2 inches won’t kill you. 2 inches is 2 inches, babe. I don’t think you love me. Hey, it’s me! Let’s hit the bed. Come here. Finally. Today you’re... Don't ask. I was just wondering how to say in Filipino... What? What’s “hickey” in Filipino? This is not a hickey, this is a mosquito bite. Yeah, it looks like a mosquito bite. You must have big mosquitoes in the Philippines. 2. The aftermath of sex. I think I have this memorized. Thank you. You are the worst decision I’ve ever made in my entire life. Really. Good! Next. “I regret every single second I spent with you.” Sir, I’m having a hard time translating this line. - Can you... - Tere, I’m not going to explain. Since you’re so good, why don’t you just translate this letter instead of prying into my life? You’re my tutor, period. If you want to translate it, Sir, just Google it. I’m a tutor, and I care for my students. Chikinini. (Hickey). Chikinini? Filipino for hickey. Chikinini. Chikinini. This is a big... Mosquito bite. Facebook: Off to watch a movie! Not now. Message: Do you know how to get to SM The Block? Hello, Sir. Tere? Don’t ask. Let’s just meet at the ticketing booth. The Cinemas, SM The Block. Okay, kitakits. Sir! I'm not late. On time, huh. Miss... You’ve got to be kidding. All the cinemas are playing the same movie? I guess you’re a fan? Oh no, not really. Nick is so hot! She’s not here. Let’s go. Thank you. Let's go. She’s not here. Let’s go. Let's go. Can you hurry up? Come on. - Wait. - Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! Thank you. There. Look, he’s taking off his shirt. Hey. She's not here. Let's go. What is your problem? I haven’t finished the movie. I don’t know the ending. Where are we? Right, that scene. After that, the guy dies. Aren't you full? Want some? No. What a great movie! I really enjoyed it. The action. And when he took off his shirt, what a body! He used to be thin, but now he’s got a big chest... Megan. I’m sorry, I thought you were a friend. Sir, who’s Megan and why are you following her? I wasn’t informed. I didn’t know we’d have to watch the movie over and over. You should’ve told me. Did you have to drag me along to find your girlfriend? You’re right, I’m sorry for dragging you into my shit. You deserve the truth, and the truth is, I saw her post something online saying she's gonna watch this movie and that’s why we’re here. I wanted to see her. It’s stupid. Sorry, Sir. I know. Don’t ask. You know what, it's okay. You know what, Sir? I think I know the solution to your broken heart. Who says I have a broken heart? Just a feeling. It hurts. Let’s go, Sir. Let’s go, Sir. This song is for those who can’t admit that they’re heartbroken. My next song: 65765. Really, you’ve memorized it? The original concert queen of Ang TV, my personal idol, Roselle Nava. ♫ Though you look at other girls ♫ ♫ my heart won’t say a word ♫ ♫ No recriminations ♫ ♫ You won’t see my tears ♫ 2. Let it all out, girl! ♫Why do I love you when you don’t even notice me? ♫ It’s your turn. Pick your song, they have a lot of choices. Perfect. Your score. Sorry about my best friend. They just met. Really? They just met, just now? Yes. That’s a successful first date, then. But then they never get to the second date. Men get scared. Why? She got pregnant at 20. She’s having a late adolescence. “Nagpapaka-teenager.” I get it. She feels like she’s still a teenager. - Hey, you’re smart. - Of course, I'm smart. I’m a business analyst, I’m supposed to be smart. Smart, but with a low EQ. What does that mean? Look at the way you’re chasing your ex. Okay, do you want to go there? Do you want her back? Maybe. I don’t know. I guess I just need answers. Wow, really? But in your letter you want to kill her. A little bit. An emotional guy is an emotional guy. But maybe it’s a bit too much. Why don’t you just say what you really want to say? Maybe you’re right. So what, we’ll change the letter? No! We’ve worked so hard on it. Sayang. What is “sayang”? It means “a wasted opportunity." 2. Rico, we could’ve been a couple, but you’re stupid! It’s okay, please stay. Dino! Dino! We could be a happy family, no? Dino! Don’t open your eyes yet. Wait. - Open you eyes! - Can I? Well? Well? Look at it! Wow. Don't you like it? Wow. Now for dessert. Uh, babe... if we were officially a couple, this would be our tenth month together. Why don’t you come back to me? I forgive you for cheating on me with Tina. And Hershey. I forgive you even if you don’t apologize. And remember how you went out with Gemma on my birthday? Are you listening, babe? What did you say? Okay, I’ll repeat it. Didn’t I tell you I’m happy with the way we are? I thought you were willing to wait. Are you losing your patience? It’s not that, but I thought you loved me. I love you, okay? But slightly. I suppose. Especially when we’re in a motel. I knew it. Mallows was right. You’re only after sex. It’s not like that, babe. You’re not being fair. Have some shame. Tell me the truth. Yes or no? Yes. Bastard! Get out! Get out! Jerk! Bastard! Get out! Hello, Hershey? I’m almost there. And for your information, you’re not great at sex! Get out! Babe, wait a moment. There. Keep the change. - I don’t need that. - Yes, I’m on my way, miss you. Hello, Julian? You done? You can finish mine if you want. I’m finished. You sure? Okay? I hate him! Here we go. I never want to see his face anymore! He... He's... What? He made... Made? You can do it. Can I speak in Tagalog? It’s hard to get mad in English. It’s a free country, go ahead. He’s a shameless bastard. I loved him! I gave him everything, and for what? What was I to him? A hobby? He only needed me when he had nothing else to do. He’s a liar! He only loved me when he needed me. Am I on call? Then he says sex is all he wants from me? What is this? Shameless bastard! Slut! Slut! He is the worst decision you’ve ever made in your life. Really. - You regret every moment you ever spent with him. - I regret every moment I gave him! You gave him everything. - I gave him everything. - You gave him your whole life. I gave him my whole life! - You even gave him a dog. - I even gave him a dog! Not a dog, a laptop. Whatever, Tere. You have to stop. Can you stop? Look at yourself, you’re wasted. I don’t know Chikinini Boy personally, but he doesn’t deserve your love. There are exes worth waiting for, or even going back to, but Chikinini Boy is not that ex. The Tere I know is filled with happiness, but he sucked all that out of you. Tere, love’s not supposed to be that cruel. It’s cruel to both of us. That’s just how it is. Love is supposed to be perfect, great, the greatest thing in the world. Nothing matters except your future with her. Then you start building that dreamhouse in your mind, you start imagining life with her, and then after that, you start naming your fricking kids! And then what? After all that’s done, you’re just left alone. What? You wanna know what happened? If you want to tell it. You know that looks disgusting, right? - Want some? - No, thanks. I met Megan when she was studying in Boston. She was the first Filipina I ever liked. Loved, actually. I never even thought I’d speak to a Filipina ever. Why? Because of your mom. My mom married my dad and immigrated to the States. Then when I was 3, she just decided to get up and go. Left with another man, a better life, I guess. It really hurt me and my dad. I grew up thinking, What did we do wrong? And then here comes Megan who changed everything. I thought. When she finished school, she decided to extend her stay for me. Stupid me, I thought it would last forever. Then one day she just tells me that she’s going back to the Philippines, her life is there, and I said, There’s no way I’m going back to a place that reminds me of my mom. Wow. Yeah, wow. We tried the long-distance thing, but that just didn’t work. We'd always fight. So I decided to book a ticket to the Philippines to surprise her. I was actually going to propose to her in Tagalog. But I never went. Because she got another guy. She’s found a better life. I guess I’m just not enough for her. Just like my mom. That’s why I’m here. So you want to forget her? Yes. So much. You know, me, too. I have to forget Rico because I can’t do this to myself. Who’s going to help us losers if not each other? hThe stupid in love. Stupid. Foolish Heart 1, Foolish Heart 2. - Help me get over Rico, - Help me get over Megan, - and I’ll help you get over Megan. - and I'll help you get over Rico. - Deal? - Game? - Game. - Deal. Wow, it’s a miracle. Only 9 minutes late this time. Let’s pick up where we left off. How are your students, by the way? What? Did I say it right? Kamusta? Ah. My other students. Ji-Hoon, my little Korean boy, is getting better at his declamation piece. Good. Good. Soo-Bi, the teenage Korean, shows no improvement at all. Why? All she does is MOMOL with her boyfriend. MOMOL? “Make out, make out lang." Yeah, I get it. “Jowa” is boyfriend or girlfriend. Jowa. Everlyn, my Pinay student, is almost ready to meet her foreigner love of her life. Jowa. And what about your other student, the pogi (handsome) one? Your pogi student. Pogi? I think his name is Julian. Ah. Julian. Is he still pogi? Don't ask. You're cheating. But Julian, I think, he's a good friend. And pogi. After you. Before I forget, this is for you. Thank you. You should get out of your hotel room even if you don’t have classes. So you can halu-bilo. What? Mingle-mingle. Okay, what time are we meeting tomorrow? Crazy. We don’t have class tomorrow. I know. I’m not asking as your student but as your friend. What time do we meet tomorrow to make halu-bilo? Aaah. Aaah. What does aah mean? - It means... - It means? Okay, 10 am tomorrow. Aaah. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye! If I drove in this city I think I’d die. Why? No one obeys the rules. Look at them. Bakla ka! What’s the matter with you? Watch the road! What does that mean, “bakla ka”? It means “You’re awesome”. Then suddenly we heard a voice call, “Consuelo? Oscar?" One of these. Intestines. In fairness... It’s actually good. When you start a question with Do, Does, or Did, it's always answerable by Yes or No. Tere, sorry, excuse me. I just find it very rude, what you’re doing now, in front of your tutor. It's disrespectful. Will you please stop being slutty. Whorish. Cheap. It’s not right. Is that okay? Do you understand what I'm saying? Sorry. Thank you. You’re going to lose. That’s what happens when you don’t listen to me. Bakla ka. What did you say? Bakla ka. What does “Bakla ka” mean? It’s an expression. An expression that doesn’t mean “You’re awesome”, right? - It means... - It means what? “You’re gay." Gay. An awesome gay. Awesome gay. Bakla ka. Bakla! Bakla! Message: Thanks again, Tere. Message: It’s nothing. 1: The sound of romantic thrills. Stay put. I have an idea. - What? - Stay put. Oh, my god. You look like my mom. You know my mom? No. My mom's Tess and I'm Gerald. I’m Tere. Nice to meet you, Tere. Oh, you like salad? Yes. I love salad. t’s green, it’s leafy, it’s... where do you live? Do you lift? I lift... in Quezon City, near Kamuning. You're funny. Would you like some drinks? Your hands are soft. I like it. Who’s this guy? Your friend? Your boyfriend? No. Your brother? No. Good to know. Oh! You okay? I think my armpit is dirty. You have some guns, huh. You don’t have to tell me that. You work out? Yeah. Often. Maybe you can teach me so I can get my arms like that. I could. You know, it’s very humid here. I hate humidity. It's very humid here! Wow, you have some abs. Could you give me some tips, because I seem to have a problem with mine. Sure. I have a problem, there are so many bumps. You have a problem there. You need liposuction. Lipo? Yeah, so many fats. Wait, where’s the light? Fine, be a couple. Get married. Hey, where are you going? - Let’s go for a swim. - No, I can't. Come on. Let's go for a swim. I'm good. Thank you. Please? Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on! Please? No, thanks. Babababa? Babababa. Go ahead. - In there? - Yes. You sure? Go in, sit down. Hey. 2: I have the last laugh. Bouncy. Shouldn’t we pay? Yeah. No, not a big bill. Here. Fare for two. Thank you. It's really smoky here, huh? You want barbecued intestines? No. It’s okay, been there, done that. So how far is your place? It’s very far from here. I’ll take this tricycle. Can I go with you? What? Why? Because I want to. - Don’t, it’s too far. - I can take a cab from your house. Never mind, I’ll be fine. Are you going to ride or flirt with each other? I’m riding. Hey, Tere. Sure you don’t want me to go with you? Just take a cab from here. Lots of taxis there. Not here? Not here. There! - Bye! Take care! - Bye. Take me to the Bliss Housing. Message: Ting-ting, could you send 10,000 pesos ASAP? It's Ting-ting. Hello? Brother. Didn’t I just send money? More than 10K? The money ran out. Fine. I’ll visit next week, I want to see the house. I’ll have our family picture framed so we can put it up. Give my love to Mom. Couldn’t you give me the cash instead? Fine. See you next week. Bye. Remember to always look into his eyes, into his soul before you speak. Can you do that? Yes. Now repeat after me. Can I have your picture so I can show Santa Claus what I want for Christmas? Hello? Christmas? Teacher? What’d he say? You're drooling. That's what he said? That was too long. Thank you. Thanks! Bye, Teacher! Bye, Everlyn! Take care, Pogi! Bye, Bakla! Remember, eye contact. Yes! I had a lot of fun today, Foolish Heart 1. Me, too, Foolish Heart 2. I didn’t even remember my ex. Me, neither. What were their names again? What’s the plan tomorrow? I’m visiting my family in Bulacan. I have a gift for them. Our family picture. That’s nice. Can I come? Okay. Cool. Hey, Dad. How are you? Terrific. Having my morning coffee. Haven’t heard much from you. Things okay? Yeah, things are good. Seen Megan? Actually I haven’t yet. You only have a couple more weeks there. What’s your plan? I don’t know, Dad, I’m just gonna make the most of my time here. Learning the language, meeting new people. Enjoying? Actually, I am. I expected it. Hard not to love the Philippines. That’s true. Is that why you took a piece of it back home? Huh? I meant Mom. Oh yeah, right. She’s one of a kind. Tell me, Dad, how’d you do it? How’d you forget about her so easily? What makes you think I forgot her? I don’t know. I was always mad and you were... Let me tell you something, son. We never forget the people we love, but once they’re gone, they’re gone. The only thing you can do is to stop going over what went wrong and start looking at what’s going right with your life. Right? Hey! Move or you’ll grow roots. You’re thinking of Julian, right? Use your head. Are you sure you won’t be hurt? You know that after 30 days, he’s out of here. You’re reaching new heights of stupidity. You’re not even sure you’re over Rico. Julian could just be the rebound. And I’m sure that if Rico calls once, you’re off running to your cheap love motel. My god, when will you ever learn? I told you all men are like that. First, they make you happy. They make you smile. Tell you you’re beautiful. That they love you. That they’ve never felt this way. Then you have sex. Then you get knocked up and you have a kid. Then one day you look at Facebook, he’s got his arm around some skinny girl who had her skin whitened. Then there you are. Sad. Wondering what you’ve done wrong. Wondering what you should’ve done so he wouldn’t leave you. Bestie, I know there are many jerks out there. Rico. Right. That jerk father of your kid. And those dates of yours who escape when they learn you have a kid. But I’m sure there are also decent guys, who will love you truly. Yes, you’ll get hurt. You’ll fight. That can’t be avoided. That’s normal. But the guy who stands by you, who is loyal, who loves you only, will come. And when he does, he’ll be worth it. You can cry, you can be foolish, but it’ll be fine. Nobody’s keeping count of how many times you’ve been a fool. What matters is that he’s there. You’re making me cry. Want some duck eggs? No, it's okay. That’s not enough for you. Two more, please. For her. Quickly. Sorry I’m late, I had to pick this up. At least you’re consistent. Wait, the tickets! Oh no, I got them. Smart! You’re learning. I’ve travelled before, I’m not five. Sometimes I forget that. Bulacan! That’s our bus, let’s go. Taralets? Taralets! This is heavy. We’re taking a tricycle. There. You okay? Just sleepy. Is this going to fit? You sure this is gonna fit in there? Stop right here. Thank you. Oh, my god! Watch your head. My house is just around the corner. Can’t wait to see it. Thank you! Can’t wait to see my dream house. We’ve been building it for years. Really? Our brand-new... Is that it? Yup. Let’s go. Excited? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing new. Does Mom know you were taking a guy home? Our little sister’s grown up. He’s not my suitor. Maybe you’re the suitor. There’s no courtship going on. He’s not my boyfriend. No, jowa, no. Friend. See? I told you. Sorry, beh. Good evening, Mom. Brother, he's gotten so big! Mom, this is my student, Julian. Good evening, Ma’am. Is he English-speaking? He knows a little Tagalog. Beautiful! I’ll find a good place for it. Don’t worry, when the house is finished, we’ll find someplace to hang it. It’s my advance housewarming gift. Ma’am, you have a beautiful home. Uncle Julian, why do you look Filipino, but you can’t speak Filipino? Son! I’m sorry. It’s okay. I look Filipino but I grew up American. My heart is Filipino. Did I say something wrong? They’re laughing because you’re cute. Your accent is cute. Cheers! Sorry. That was good. Lally texted. We should be off. Ting-ting, we’re going. Where are you going? Playing cards again? We won’t be long. Let's go. Bye! What’s wrong? Nothing. You lying woman. Come on, spill the beans. I feel bad. I don’t know. I was hoping that all the money I sent had built something. You know the feeling that you don’t care if you have nothing left, as long as your family gets something? The feeling that you can see what you’ve worked for? Here, our dreamhouse. Then when you get here, that’s it. All your effort wasn’t appreciated. I wish I could’ve done more. Are you kidding me? You’ve done more than you should. I meant that if I’d passed my Nursing boards... You know what happened? I fell in love. Hmmm. Hmmm, stupid. Let me guess, with Chikinini Boy? No, with someone from school. They were counting on me, but I let them down. I was so full of guilt because I messed up. So now I’m trying to be the best daughter I can be. I’m saving money to build our house. Eventually I’ll go back to nursing, work abroad and provide for them better. You’ll make a great nurse. Really? Yeah. You really know how to take care of people. Like me. It’s nothing. Even if you give and give and you feel like nothing comes of it, you’re wrong. You don’t know how you change people’s lives. Mine. Man, your Tagalog is still terrible. Hey, my Tagalog is okay. Not. It’s bad. Yeah. It’s getting better, though. Yeah. You know what I mean. So. So. If you run into Megan... My god. What will you tell her? What’s your name? Crazy, the real speech! You know, I guess I’ll prove to her that I can be Filipino, after all. I’ll tell her what you taught me. What? Bakla ka. Sayang, kitakits. You’re beautiful. You’re a good woman. I’m happy when I’m with you. With you, I’m laughing and happy. I want you to be happy, too. I like you. I like you too, Juilian. You’re so mean to me. Why? How come you didn’t you get me one? I wanted one. I offered you one, you declined. I don’t understand what you said, but it would’ve been nice if you got me one. Next time. Aah. Next time. This is evidence of how selfish you are. This deserves a selfie. Let me see. I look fat. Take another picture. You’re not fat. - Come on. - You kind of look like a pork bun. Pork bun, really? Too much of that. Okay, I'm sorry. You don’t look like a pork bun. You look like a dumpling. Then he told me he wasn’t seeing her anymore. I don’t understand. That jerk. You’re so pretty, and he replaces you. I knew something was off, you should’ve listened to me. He said he’d broken it off. I thought he was the one. I’m so stupid. Forget it. I’m sure in a little while you’ll find someone better. She’s so perfect for him! He has a lot of nerve. 1: Flawless. That would be you! You’re the luckiest girl in the entire Philippines. Really? Really. Why? Because you’re with the handsomest guy in the country. Fine, whatever you say. It’s Megan. I think I should talk to her. Go. Hey, you lying woman. You shameless slut. Whore. I gave you everything. My life. I even gave you a dog. You beast. I did everything for you and you do this to me. Don’t come to my street, I’ll have you beaten. I’ve never loved like this. I left nothing for myself. You don’t know how much it hurts. You couldn’t handle it if it happened to you. Don’t come to my neighborhood. I’ll have you beaten up by the drunks on the corner. You don’t know how a broken heart seeks revenge. You have no idea. ♫ Though you look at other girls ♫ Driver, could you turn off the radio? ♫ my heart won’t say a word ♫ ♫ Why do I love you when you don’t even notice me ♫ Please just change the station. On the radio: What should I do? You complain about these men when you allow them to do this to you! Come on, pick up the phone. You knew this would happen, and now you cry. Stop crying, you’re like an injured kitten. Hi, Mommy. Come in. Have a seat. - I’ll get a plate for you. - Thank you. Ji-Hoon, congratulations! Third place! Very good. Thank you, Miss Tere, I love you. Give me a hug. Good job. Do you want to open the gift? Does you love me? Not “does”, do. Do you love me? I just want to study first and make my parents proud. What? What are you talking about? Just go. Teacher, sorry. It’s okay. Good essay. I’m so happy. Are you hungry? But I want you to eat. Very good, baby. I told you, you’d get him. Nothing is impossible in love. Sorry? Nothing is impossible in love. Tere! - May I borrow her? - Go ahead. Your cellphone! - Why don’t you answer your phone? - What’s the emergency? Julian went to your house. What’d he say? and I didn’t know when you’d be home. Okay. Whatever. Thank you. Godmother, he left you this note. He looks like a nice guy. I approve! Come on. Give him a chance, please. Fine. I’ll see you next week. I’m going to Bulacan. Bulacan! The bus is leaving! Tere, I’m hoping that you’ll speak to me when you get home. I’m sorry if this letter is not perfect. Could I talk to Tere? I really need to talk to her. Why not leave a message? Who am I kidding? I can’t do this without you. Truth is, I’m scared of losing you. I’m so used to having you around. Tere, I’ve never been happier. I know you’re upset because I spoke to Megan. We made a promise we’d forget them. I want to say sorry for breaking that promise. But when I saw her, I needed to talk to her. To close off all the remaining thoughts n my head. Thanks for understanding, Julian. I’m really sorry for everything. This is all for the best. I’m really happy for you. Babe! I'm sorry. I’m sorry I’m late, but I have a good reason. I saw this on my way here and I got it for you. This is Julian. Julian, this is Ernest, my fiance. Fiance, wow. Congratulations. When I saw her, I was so sure I had no more feelings for her. All that remains in my heart is you. I wanted to say goodbye to you before I leave for New York. I hope you read this before it’s too late. I’ll go to Bulacan and wait for you as long as I can. Please, Tere, answer your phone. Hello, Mom? If Julian goes there, please tell him… Hello? Mom? Miss, excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry! Driver, could we go faster? Please, it’s an emergency. Sorry, we can’t go faster. We might have an accident. But I really need to get there now! Please! This is the only time I haven’t been a fool! If you believe in love, drive faster! Don’t you all believe in love? Huh? Did you hear that? Faster! Faster! Mom! Was Julian here? Yes. Is he inside? Oh, no. I couldn’t reach your phone. He left to catch a flight. Tricycle, wait! Hurry! Catch him! Faster, I have to get to him! Excuse me. Let me on. Ma’am, the bus is full. We’re leaving. Isn’t there any space? I’ll stand. I’ll sit on your lap. I’m not heavy. I won’t overload your bus. But I have to look inside just to check if he’s there. Ma’am, sorry, you’re late. Hey, tanga one. Late again, as usual. Don’t worry, I figured I was going to miss my flight. You know, traffic on Edsa. Thank you, Lord, traffic on Edsa! Sorry. I thought you would go back to her. I thought you’d remember all your feelings for her and forget me. I thought... You thought... Tere, why would I do that? I’m sorry. That’s why I’m here. Here I am again, the stupid woman chasing a guy when she’s not even sure he’ll wait for her. But you know what I realized? I’m going to do a stupid thing again, but it’s okay to be stupid for the right person. You’re worth it. Because I love you. Tere, that’s a lot of words. English only, please. I didn’t understand a word. Except for the part where you said you love me. - But I mean it. - That’s all I needed to know. this guy on the bus coming here taught me a line. “What good is the horse when the grass is dead.” - Is it right? - Nice try, but you have it backwards, babe. Do you know what it means? Yes. Don’t waste an opportunity. Sayang. I know another line. Go on. “Whoever doesn’t love his own language, grew up in another country." So you’re staying? Maybe. Yes. Tere, I’m tanga too, remember? And my foolish heart is madly in love with you. I love you. I love you, too, Julian. You love me? Uh-huh. Really? Are we gonna get on this bus? It’s the sweethearts. Come on. Can I just share his seat? Bye!
