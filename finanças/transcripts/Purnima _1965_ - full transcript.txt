"You are the caretaker of the world." "Hey, omniscient." "You are the time." "You are the one with the wheel." "Please accept our prayers." Ever since we have got married.. You just keep doing this all the time. I ask you. Don't you have anything else to do apart from this? Meena, Chimanbhai Suratwala doesn't need to work. It's been a whole 11 and half months and three days.. Since we got married. But still there is no result. Various kids are hanging on the walls. I have been crying hoarse that pick up.. A child from there and throw him into my lap. You can't feed your own mouth. You still live in your in-law's house. What will you feed him if I have a baby? But since I'm already being supported by my brother-in-law's sister.. So, what difference does it make? You two mean the same to me. Shut up! You don't trust me? Come, peep into my heart. Look. Come on, look. - Brother-in-law. - Yes. He has spoilt the fun. These brother-in-laws always act as barriers.. Between the husband and wife. You just move ahead and bang.. Come. Come, Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law, what the hell is happening? I was working out. You are indeed packing on some muscles. I have already used the motor. Now, what remains are the push-ups. Carry on with your push-ups till evening. - By then I'll be back from work. - Very well. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. What is it, Brother-in-law? I forgot something. Get a bottle of Gripe water while coming home. These days my health has started deteriorating. My sweet little brother-in-law, how about Dongre's almond sweet? No. I will have only Gripe water. Is it? I'll get you a bottle. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Any letters? - Yes. - Then send it to me. - Yes. - Here. - Why did you take the trouble? - It's all right. - Thank you. Ms. Vandana, how come your letter is in my pile of letters? My letter? And here. Gosh! This is in Urdu. Please read it out for me. Please. What happened? It is quite a dangerous letter. Dangerous. Read it. Please. - Darling. - Yes. I'm not saying that. It's mentioned in this. Oh. Go on. Ever since I have seen you, I've been smitten by you. I'm lost in your thoughts day and night. You are my life. I worship you. - Really. - Yes. - Should I believe that? - Believe what? What are you saying? I'm only reading. Sometimes try writing as well. Please do write the same thing. Oh. Now, I get it. - A new prank. - Obviously. Sir, the boss has called you. Okay. When did sir come? Quite a while ago? Is everything okay? He is overhauling his son. Oh. Now, I won't let you have your way anymore. Rs. 20,000 went missing two months ago. Last month, Rs.10000. And this month, Rs.50,000 can't be accounted for. I ask you what you have splurged the money on. Father, I'm extremely sorry. I can't recollect anything in spite.. Of straining every bit of my brain. You have made my life miserable. You make me suffer all the time. Father, I should be the one complaining about that. Shut up! It's better to be childless than have a worthless child. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Prakash, can you give me account of the Rs.50000.. That were withdrawn from the company's account? Mr. Basant can answer that better than me. Mr. Basant. He can't recollect anything in spite.. Of straining every bit of his brain. Father, you humiliate me before others.. As if I'm some ordinary employee. I'm the general manager of the company. Not some clerk. A clerk is much better than you. He earns a living by working hard. They don't blow up their father's.. Hard earned money like you do. Prakash, now onwards, you'll look after the accounts. I appoint you the in-charge of the company's account. All right. And from now on, he won't get a penny without your approval. You are blatantly insulting me. I can never tolerate that. Get out if you can't tolerate it. You will be responsible if there is any misappropriation of funds. - Got it? - Yes. - Sorry. - Pathetic rat! I'm coming in a bit. "Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!" "You're the wings, I'm the flight." "You're the melody of my life." "And I'm the voice of that melody." "Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!" "You're the wings, I'm the flight." "You're the song of my life." "I'm the style of that song." "Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!" "The eyes have coyly conveyed the inhibitions in my heart." "A love-struck person has heard the other love-struck person." "You're the culmination of love." "And I'm the beginning of love." "I'm the beginning of love." "Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!" "You're the wings, I'm the flight." "You're the song of my life." "I'm the style of that song." "Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!" "Whether it's about the sky or the earth." "All the things now start and end with you." "You're beautiful. A damsel." "You're the stylish one. And I'm the style." "You're the stylish one. And I'm the style." "Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!" "You're the wings, I'm the flight." "You're the melody of my life." "And I'm the voice of that melody." "Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!" "You're the wings, I'm the flight." "You're the melody of my life." "And I'm the voice of that melody." "Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!" - So, you are back, darling? - Yes, Mother. Give this to me. Let it be. Your hands might get scraped. Since your father's maid is here to do all this. I curse that woman who died. Neither would she have died nor would I come into this house. And nor would I have to see this wretched face. Darling, why are you after this poor girl's life all the time? You just keep quiet. You have pampered her rotten. After all, why are you after her life? Gosh! I'm after her. Have I gone crazy? Am I mad? You always say hurtful things to me defending your daughter. It's better than I die. Lord, please grant me death. Death is better than this life. Ganga, please keep quiet for God's sake. Harbouring ill feeling towards her all the time is not right. Put an end to this fight. This fight will end only when she gets married and I die. Do you get that? After your mother's death, there wasn't anyone to look after you. I swear on God. I got married only for your sake. I never knew that your father's house.. Would become a hell-hole for you. Father, don't be sad. I have become used to these things. Oh, my! Gosh! It's you. Yes, darling. Go away. You uncouth girl. But where do I get the style to love you from? Fall in love with someone. He'll teach you. - I have tried that as well. - What! Who is that guy? There is a silly boy. But he can't see beyond his work. He is really a true soul. Since he has the passion to do something else.. In spite of all your advances. Bring him to meet me some day. How would someone who doesn't have time for me meet you? Do this. Just ignore him for some days. I bet you'll fall at your feet. You are really experienced now. Have you been smitten by someone? - No. - Look, don't try to hide it from me. - Tell me. Who is it? - No one. Swear on me then. I'm not shameless like you. I feel shy. Gosh! These tantrums. But who is that birdie? He is a human. I never said you've fallen for a donkey. After all, who is he? What does he do? I don't know. And nor do I want to find out. What if someday the prey loses his way? Where would you look for him? I have confidence in myself. Undoubtedly. The trap is new, strong and first-class. Bring him here to meet me. Have you introduced to your man? I'll introduce him to you today itself. Today? Where? In my new office. We have to go to collect charity for the women's society. Bela and Neelu will be joining us there. You also come along. You skipped the meeting yesterday, isn't it? That's why I have come to inform you. Okay. See you. - Listen. - What? Go away. - You! - Poonam! How come you are here? This is my office. I work here. Wonderful. - My friend too works here. - Your friend? Who? Vandana Mehra. Vandana. Is she your friend? Why are you so surprised? Nothing. You never told me. I never got the chance to tell you. - Where is she? - Come. Sit here. This is her desk. She'll be here any moment. Poonam. When did you come? Just now. Look after your friend. Poonam, excuse me. How do you know him? Just as you know your man. What do you mean? He is the one about whom I had told you. How is my choice? Tell me. It's good. Very good. Excellent. And where is your prince charming? Just call him. There is no one. I was just joking. - That was a joke. - Yes. You have never ever played such a serious joke. Never before has such a situation arisen. What situation? Vandana had promised me that when I come to office, she'll.. Poornima. Don't say anything further. For my sake. Okay. Okay. I won't. Bela and Neelu haven't come yet? May I ask you why the women army is gathering here? To raid your prisons. We are collecting charity for the women society. There is only one big fish here. Mr. Basant. - Come, I'll take you to him. - Come. No. You go. I'll wait for Bela and Neelu. - Okay. - Come. Ms. Poornima, I guess I have seen you before. No. This is the first time we have met. Okay. So be it. It certainly won't be the last. In what locality do you live? The lanes are very narrow. Your cars won't be able to get there. I'll come on foot. There are many potholes. You'll stumble and fall. Don't worry. I'll somehow stumble my way to your house. Mr. Basant, it would better if we talk business. Sure. Sure. Here's my wallet. Take as much as you want. No. Give us how much ever you want to. No. Whatever you say. Come on, tell me. Please. - Rs.100 would be enough. - That's it. Here are Rs.200. Take it. Take it. Here. Thank you. Let's go, Poonam. - And no letters. - Moron! Basant will find Poornima sooner or later. "You're the song of my life." - Hello. - Hello. Don't be so rude. I'm here only to meet you. What for? Ask that to my heart. It beats for you all the time. Mr. Basant, I hate indecency. I'm not being indecent at all. I just want to present my heart to you. Keep it with you. Look, don't refuse. You won't regret it. After all, what can Prakash give you? I can bring all the happiness in the world to your feet. I don't care about such happiness. Go away. Why would I come here if I had to go? Then you can die here. She gets angry at my love. But I love her anger. Poonam. Where are storming to? What's the matter? Go ask your boss's son. He was saying indecent things to me. So, the loafer has reached here as well. He is as big a loafer as decent is his father. Now onwards, let me know if he says anything to you. I'll fix him real good. But Prakash, how long will we keeping meeting like this? Now, even mother wants me out of the house as soon as possible. She wants you out of the house. And I want you in my house. I'll send my brother-in-law to your father tomorrow itself. As to when do I come with the wedding procession? Listen, it will be so much fun. I would be the groom. You would be the bride. Then we'll get married. And I'll bring you to my house from your house. Then? What will happen then? You are so cheap! It's been so long. But brother-in-law has still not returned from Poornima's house. Brother, you've sent a lunatic there. I'm afraid that instead of getting the engagement fixed.. He might mess it all up. Here he comes. My dear brother-in-law. Just give me the good news. I.. What's the matter, Brother-in-law? Hold the umbrella, son. Brother-in-law, you are coming from Poornima's house, isn't it? Hold this court as well. But what happened? - Look, I went directly to their house. - Then? I knocked on the door. Then Mr. Motilal peeped outside and opened the door. Is it? Then what happened, Brother-in-law? What do you expect? I went straight into the house. I smiled at him. He too smiled at me. Like this. Only four teeth were visible out of the 32. But what happened next, Brother-in-law? As you know, I told the oldie that we like your daughter. Then the oldie asked me, "Brother, what is your name?" And what do you do? I retorted that I'm Chimanbhai Suratwala. And my work is that I'm a live-in son-in-law. As soon as he heard this the oldie got enraged. And in that rage, he said, "Get out, Chimanbhai Suratwala." Otherwise, I will disfigure your face. That's it. My palms started getting sweaty. You see, Brother. Did you go there to fix brother's marriage or your marriage? My father's marriage. Why are you butting in? So, Brother-in-law, I quickly told him that.. I'm not here for my marriage. I'm here with my brother-in-law's proposal. - Then? - The oldie was over the moon. He said that your brother-in-law is one in a million. I'm ready to get my daughter married to your brother-in-law. My brother-in-law. Hey! What are you doing? Aren't you ashamed of doing that in front of your sister? Brother-in-law. Look, make the arrangement for the wedding quickly. Okay. I'll arrange the money. And you make arrangements for my wedding. Quickly. I will. I will. "My beloved." Brother will handle everything. But we must also do something. I'll do anything you ask me to do. 1000, 2000, 2500, 2750.. Stop. Stop. Stop.. You don't even have a single penny in your pocket. And you're talking about thousands. Come on. As the case is. You take your dear ones for granted. You don't know this Indian Hindi Port. I can multiply the money in a flash. Multiply the money! This is nothing. If you give me Rs.500 today and don't.. Make Rs.25000 out of it in five days.. Then call me your family barber and not your husband. - Really. - I cross my heart. - Out with 500 bucks. - Not here. - Then where? - Let's go to our room. - Come on. Sir, look carefully and tell me what business.. Would be beneficial for me. Help me! Oh, my! The lines are dangerous. No planet is in its right position. Mars and Mercury are at loggerheads. And Venus is under the cloud. And the Saturn has overwhelmed Jupiter. And Sunday.. And Sunday is nowhere in sight. What nonsense, Sir. All the days of the week are Sundays to me. And ever since I have become the brother-in-law.. I've leading a leisurely life. - But now, your peace will be ruined. - Why? If you don't offer money to a Priest immediately, you'll be dead. You are done for, Chimanbhai. Now, where do I bring a priest from at such a short notice? Idiot! Who is this sitting before you? I'm sorry, Brother. I failed to recognise you. Forgive me. Now, if you give me the order, I will give you 525 annas (monetary unit). 525 annas won't do. Then will 775 do? - 775 won't do either. I need Re.1 to change the stars. - Is it? Here you go. All the troubles have been done away with. Now, you'll prosper. Sir, just tell me when I become India's Henry Ford. Henry Ford? What the hell is that? What are you thinking, sir? You have to take great pains to get to this position. Only a select few sages have got to that position. Sages. What nonsense! Henry Ford hailed from America. He had built the Ford car, truck and lorry. So what? Be it America or Africa. Henry Ford comes into being anywhere. Some built cars. And some shave people. - Do you know what India's Henry Ford did? - No. He had built a chariot for Ravan in the battle of Mahabharat (Hindu epic). Is it? You're great. Sir, you're great. I never came across a more learned man than you. Now, just tell me what business will help me prosper. - Out with Re.1. - Hold on. Here it is, sir. The country will be under the cloud. Various types of disease will spread. Countless people will die. Sell medicines. No. No, sir. That would be too expensive. Suggest me a business that will get me Rs.1000 if I invest Re.1. Then go start wood and garment business. You will prosper. A wood and garment business. Sir, I can't seem to get it. If you sit here, you'll understand nothing. - An intelligent donkey.. - I understood. I understood. A sign in more than enough. A wood and garment business. A wood and garment business. Brother, I'm ready to buy all your funeral clothes by the lot. So, is the entire family dead? No. The entire family is not dead. Then what for? Only for the sake of a great man like you. What did you say? Brother, increasing the population is in a human's hands. But decreasing it is God's hands. And is kind to me these days. Hence, pack all the funeral clothes. Hold on. Pack them. I've won the battle. Henceforth I'll be known as Chimanbhai Kafanwala. Readymade funeral clothes. I'll be where there is death with the funeral clothes. Home delivery. Speedily at that. Oh, my! What is all this? This is the balance of death. Funeral clothes. - For whom? - Don't worry. It's not for you. It's for business. Come on in, Brothers. Keep all the stuff in my bedroom. Don't you dare bring it inside! Out. You have wasted Rs.500. I have wasted it! This is pure gold. Pure gold. What nonsense! Brother is getting married. And you are concerned about what's auspicious and what's not. Quiet. You're talking about Mangal (auspicious).. On Budh (Wednesday). Sir has said that the situation is going to worsen. Countless people will die. And my funeral clothes will sell like hot cakes. You! Take this away. Else I will burn it. My, my. Why do you bother? These clothes are meant to be burnt. Are you going or not? I'm. But let me tell you. Choose one of your sizes. You'll need it. What? You'll make me wear funeral clothes. I won't. God will make your wear it. - Get out. - I'm going. - Won't you let me go in? - No. - Then I'll go sell these funeral clothes in a flash. Let's go, Brothers. In a flash. My foot! So you are here. Don't you think you are early? You order me to come at a fixed time.. But you are nowhere in sight. Why are you mum? Remove your hand. Remove it. Come on. So, you won't. I'll teach you a lesson. - You? - Why do you have such long nails? To scratch the faces of loafers like you. Where are you off to? Mr. Basant, I just might forget my manners.. You might get a tight slap on across your face. Who cares about the face? You have made my life colourful. If you don't believe me, then listen to the beats of my heart. Which beats for you all the time? - Come on. - You pathetic idiot! These fragile hands are not mean for hitting someone. But are meant to put around someone's neck. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me, you idiot! Leave me, you idiot! Leave me! Leave me, you idiot. Now, I'll leave you only when I make you mine. How dare you! You animal! You rat! How dare you raise your hand on our master.. In spite of being a servant! Don't give me that nonsense about being a servant. To hell with you and your job. I would've buried you alive if not for your father. Get out of here if your life is dear to you. Prakash! Prakash! Come on. I shall be doomed if I don't make them suffer. Really. What makes me happy is that you agreed to get married. Who is that girl? Motilal's daughter Poornima. Poornima. Oh. Ganga's step daughter. I know her. She is beautiful. I like her. That's it. Now get this alliance approved as soon as you can. - Okay, son. - My dear mother. But Mother, I hope father will agree to this. Don't worry about him. Consider that this marriage is on. Whom are you getting married? - Basant. - Only humans get married. And not animals. Mother, like I had told you. Look, don't.. Don't dream of ruining some poor girl's life. This moron is not worthy of getting married to any decent girl. You say whatever comes to your mind. After all, what's wrong with my son? You have been blinded by your love for him. That's you can't see his deeds. How do I explain to you? He is ruining our wealth, reputation and business. This is not true, Mother. Shut up! What did he splurge Rs.50000 on, the last month? - Ask him. - 50000. Mother, I had donated it as charity to orphanage.. Women care centre and cowshed. Heard that? Now, tell me. What wrong has he done? You have gotten used to jibing at him. You won't believe me till you see his misdeeds for yourself. Come with me. Here's the cowshed. Here's the orphanage. And here's the widow care centre. Basant, what is this? Speak up. What is this? Mother, these liquor bottles aren't mine. Then are they mine? No, these belong to the drunkards.. Whom we have convinced to quit drinking. He is an absolute rogue, loafer and a liar. He will never get married. This is my final decision. Got it? Father, you'll have to change your decision. What? Otherwise, there will be bloodshed. Basant, don't you dare raise your hand on your father. Mother, I don't want to kill father. I want to kill myself. No, Basant. No. What's the point in leading a life.. Wherein a father has no respect for his son? Leave me. Leave me. - No, Basant. - Leave me, Mother. Please say yes. Say yes for God's sake. Mother, don't force father. Let me die. No, No. I beg of you. Are you his father or his enemy? Please say yes. Say yes for God's sake. I beg of you. Do whatever you want. To hell with you people. Mother, you are a darling. You are a darling. Mother, I must get married to Poornima. Yes, son. But I have heard that she is already engaged. She is already engaged. Sister, well whatever you are saying is right. But the arrow has already left the bow. Her father has fixed her marriage a few days ago. Marriages are fixed and then called off. If has fixed it, then you get it called off. This is very difficult, Sister. It is difficult, but it is not impossible. I have heard that Lala dances to your tune. You have heard right. But what do I say, Sister? Sometimes when he acts stubborn.. It becomes a little difficult to make him budge. According to me, wash your hands off this proposal. Anyway, as you wish. My son's insistence had dragged me to you. I thought his wish will come true.. And you too will gain something along the way. But I guess only this wallet is in his destiny. Okay. See you later. What's the big hurry? Sit, Sister. Please sit. What's the point in waiting here? The thing is I do not like turning you down like this. Then what are you waiting for? Say yes. I've come here to give you money. Only in return of a daughter-in-law. Sister, to be honest, anyone who sees.. Poornima is left dumbstruck. As it is, I never lie. I have already turned down around 12 marriage proposals. I agreed only when the boy's family agreed to give us Rs.12000. Then take 13000 from me. 13! But the difference is of just 1000. It's seems a little dicey to invite so much of trouble.. And curses from the other party for such a meagre amount. Then let's settle it at Rs.14000. 14000. No, Sister. Let's settle it on 15. We have a deal if you are willing to pay 15. So, be it. But I hope Lala will agree. Forget him. I have the keys to him. I can manipulate him anyway I want. My name is Ganga. I annihilate anyone who goes against me. Now, we are talking. Here are Rs.13000. And 2000 post the wedding. But Sister, I should get it before the nuptial rounds. Don't worry about them. The job should be done. Don't worry about that. Okay, I'll take your leave now. - Bye. - Bye. I shall see how you don't return it. - Come with me. - No. I said come with me. - No, I won't come. - Leave me. - I said leave me. - You will have to return the money. Leave me. Father! - Oh, my God! - Father! Father! Father! Come. - Doctor. - Don't worry. Have courage. My heart is sinking. Neither does the bleeding stop.. Nor does he regain consciousness. That's why I too am worried. I think some internal vein has burst We will have to take him to a clinic immediately. Delay would be fatal. I'll call up the specialist. He must be operated upon immediately. Operation. It's a major operation. At least Rs.10000 would be needed. Rs.10000. I'll call up the ambulance. What did the doctor say? He'll have to be operated upon. - Operation. - Yes. How much money do we have at our disposal? Around 70 or 80. - Just 70 or 80. - Yes. My daughter won't be sold off. She won't be sold off. Return it. Return the money. Return the money. Return every single penny. I'll return it right away. Right away. - Very well. - Look. Look. I'll go return it right away. I'll go return it right away. Mother, this money won't be returned. - Give it to me. - But Poornima.. Give it to me. What are you saying? Think of.. I don't want to think about anything. I accept all their conditions. I will marry him. I will marry. I will marry him. Hello. The wedding was quite an affair. The only thing it lacked was Prakash. Poor chap. He didn't come to even congratulate us. His absence from the wedding must have shocked you. And you must be feeling like crying because of his disloyalty. I have forgotten everything. This is not right. Just recollect those moments when you and him were together. The old Poornima is dead. Now, I don't remember anything. Apart from you. Your memory is very weak. When Prakash hears this, he will be grief-stricken. Let him be. I've burnt all the relationship in the sacred wedding fire. Now, you're my God. You don't need to be so formal. Well, if mentioning the name hurts you, then I won't utter it again. I hope you are happy now. Then give me a smile. Come on, smile. Look, I have got such a beautiful gift for you. Why? Did you like it? Very good! Amazing! You've separated the heartbeat from the heart so expertly. But remember, if I ever see both of you together.. I'll ruin your lives. That day will never arrive. It will never arrive. I beg at your feet. Please forget my past. Now, you are everything to me. Everything. Okay, I trust you. "May the light of happiness brighten up your life.." "The darkness suits me today." "I was estranged from myself after meeting you." "I've come closer on leaving you." "May the light of happiness brighten up your life." "The darkness suits me today." "I don't complain about your disloyalty." "I'm crazy, I don't regret." "I don't complain about your disloyalty." "I'm crazy, I don't regret." "My steps have brought me this far." "The darkness suits me today." "I'm leaving the garden with this allegation." "I've passed many days in your name." "I'm leaving the garden with this allegation." "I've passed many days in your name." "I've reached far from the destination of desires." "The darkness suits me today." "May the light of happiness brighten up your life." "The darkness suits me today." "I was estranged from myself after meeting you." "I've come closer on leaving you." So, you have made a sacrifice for your father and earned a merit. But remember, Poornima, you have committed a grave sin.. Along with earning a merit. Vandana, stop it for God's sake. Don't make fun of my helplessness. I can't hear anything now. I can't hear anything. You can't hear and I can't bear to see his sorrow. It's better that God gives me death. If I won't be alive, I won't see him in such pain. Vandana? I want to talk to you about something. What is left to talk now? Mr. Prakash, I've very less time. I don't have any time too. I didn't urge you to prick my wounds. Nor did I call you here to see the scene of my burning desires. I've not come here to prick your wounds. Then why have you come here? Which other sorrow do you still want to give me? I've come to break that dream which you are lost in. I've come to bury those memories which you still remember. What else do I have except those memories now? You want to snatch them too from me? Mr. Prakash, now you don't have any right to say this. - It is a sin. - A sin? Of course it is a sin to think about someone else's wife. I don't want anyone else to utter my name except my husband. All right. Now, I will never utter your name. And if I'm unable to forget those memories.. I'll kill myself. Do you want to die and mar a stigma on me? You want me to think for lifetime.. That a stranger gave up his life for me? No, no. God is the witness, I don't want to defame you. I don't want to bring infamy to you. If you don't want to defame me, then listen to me. Please marry Vandana. Marry? And me? A dead body is covered with a flower sheet.. And not adorned with a flower veil. Mr. Prakash, the time is the best healer forever sorrow.. And caravan of life goes ahead. Life doesn't teach to turn back but to go ahead. I'm saying this for your well-being. If you are so concerned about my well-being.. Tell me what was my fault that you gave me such a big punishment? Our destiny has given us this punishment. That money which my mother-in-law gave to my mother.. They were the deadline between my love and father's life. My happiness was not greater than my father's life. Mr. Prakash, I can take birth thousand times.. And sacrifice myself for him. I don't have any complaints from you now. Then you give your consent for marriage. But.. but I can't give any happiness to anyone. She will never be unhappy with you. No, no. I don't want to make any girl's life miserable. She will be the happiest in your company. Please say yes. Mr. Prakash, please say yes. I don't understand anything. What should I do? What should I do? Won't you fulfil my last desire? Tell me, Mr. Prakash. All right. As you wish. Milk. No. Not like this. In this way. Here. Drink it. Vandana, you are so good. You care a lot for me. But I think as if I am your culprit. My past.. I don't want to hear anything. A devotee is only concerned with worship. She doesn't need to find out her God's feelings. You are mine. You are with me. It is enough for me. Vandana. Leave it. Leave it. I tell you. I will never leave my brother's house. - Remove my clothes. - Listen to me first. Then why did you marry me? Look, Meena, my brother-in-law's home is settled. Now, you worry about settling our house. I've found a first-class house with three windows for you. I will never thrive on earnings of shrouds by staying with you. Instead of being honest, it's better that one.. Depends on the earning of shrouds. Then go and become one. Look, a husband is like God. And you want to get separated from your husband? Come on, get ready quickly. I've said, I will never come with you. If you don't want to walk along with me.. Then walk a little ahead or behind. - I will walk in middle. - No. - Then I will go alone. - Go. I will really go. This is your sari. This is your stole and your skirt. I don't need the mattress. Throw it. - So, you are going? - Yes. You may definitely go. But do write letters to me. - I won't write any letter. - Then send a telegram. I don't have so much money. But do send me a money order as soon you start earning. I will repay the loan. Don't repay the loan but perform my father's funeral rites. It's better to be a widower instead of having such a wife. I'm going. Goodbye. I just request that remember your husband.. When you are fed up of your brother's house. Perhaps. Why perhaps? It's better that you stay here. Oh, God, protect my sister-in-law. Give us good news. Nurse. Tell me, Nurse. Congratulations. A baby boy is born. - Thank you very much. - Congratulations, Brother. Same to you for your nephew. But this joy is incomplete without brother-in-law. I'll bring him right now. No, Brother. You can't bring him on the right track. I've it's solution. I know. Watch it. He will come running ahead of me today. All right, then go soon. It means he will take me to the sky from the earth? Yes. Don't listen to him. Yesterday, he had administered the same injection.. To washer-man Kalua's donkey. In the morning Kalua found the donkey smiling. - He was smiling like this? - Yes. - I don't want to die. You will become a widow. - Right. Don't worry. I won't become a widow so soon. Look, give him such a treatment.. That his disease gets cured completely. Idea! I think I should operate upon him and clean his stomach. - Operation? - Yes, my dear. All right. First, operate him and then.. Apply Bamboo Shah's kohl in eyes. No, I won't undergo an operation.. And apply Bamboo Shah's kohl in my eyes. Don't panic. Be brave. He performs the operation in a snap. He will slit your stomach in a snap.. And sew it back after cleaning it in a snap. Forget it. I'll lose my life in a snap too. I won't let you operate upon my tummy. - Coward. - I am. The stomach ailment is the root cause of all the diseases. Come on, Doctor, hurry up. - But why are you forcing me? - Slit it. - Leave me. - Doctor, hurry up. Wretched cruel butcher! Meena, I swear by you, I'm not sick. - I was pretending. - He was pretending. An excuse? You get the disease of giving excuses.. Also because of an upset stomach. I'll have to operate you at any cost. No, no. Meena! Meena, I beg at your feet. Please save me. On one condition. Only if you return home with me. Yes, I will come. - Will you become a live-in son-in-law? - I will. - Will you do any wrong business? - I will. - What? - No. I won't. Never. - Will you press my hands and feet if I've pain? - I will. Very good. You both have given a fantastic performance. - What? - We are not real but duplicates. You cheated me? - It won't take long for a real doctor to arrive. - No, no. Pay them Rs.20 immediately. - But where will I give them Rs.20 from? - From your pocket. I don't have a penny. But I've two pieces of shrouds. You both take it. You will need them after you die. - What? - Mother! - Mother? - No, dear. - Not Maya but Meena. - Yes, Meena. Congratulations. Your grandson is born. - Really? - Yes. - Is our daughter-in-law fine? - Yes. God has given us such a big happiness.. But I wonder where that wretched boy is. - Hello. - Oh, Vandana. Come. Have a seat, dear. - How are you? - I'm fine, Uncle. - How is Prakash? - He is fine. - How is his business going on? - It's fine by God's grace. I'm happy. I'm really glad to know it. Vandana, you? How did you remember to come here? First, call brother-in-law then I'll tell you. He has gone to Nainital. Nainital? And alone? Don't talk about that worthless guy, dear. The world has changed, but not him. Forget it. Tell me the purpose of your visit. Like every year we are organising a charity show.. For the women's society this year too. Do you want a donation? I want donation and permission for Poonam too. - No, Vandana. I can't participate. - Why not? The show's success is impossible without you. But Vandana, I don't have any time. Do you have to plough the field that you don't have any time? Look, Prakash is so busy but still he has.. Shouldered the entire responsibility. The show won't stop if I don't participate. You are needlessly being stubborn. In fact you are stubborn, Daughter-in-law. Prakash and Vandana are organising the show.. So you must definitely go. But, Father, I.. How can't I? I understand, dear. You are thinking about Basant, right? He won't say anything as I'm giving you permission. Vandana, be assured. My daughter-in-law will definitely participate in the show. "It's the full moon, the night is showering love." "Lord Krishna is standing with the flute today." "Radha, your Krishna is playing the flute." "Radha, your Krishna is playing the flute." "Friend, why are you upset? Why are you upset?" "Friend, why are you upset? Why are you upset?" "Because of who you couldn't sleep yesterday." "Because of who you couldn't sleep yesterday." "Friend, why are you upset? Why are you upset?" "Friend, why are you upset? Why are you upset?" "Friend, I agree that shepherd of Gokul is mischievous." "Shepherd of Gokul." "Then why have you applied the kohl of his love?" "Why did you apply the kohl?" "Forget this excuse. Why are you hiding it from us?" "You are lying. You are lying." "Friend, why are you upset? Why are you upset?" "He impressed me but not his flute." "This flute is the enemy of your love." "This flute is the enemy." "Give up this flute, it is Radha's rival." "It is Radha's rival." "Get rid of this dilemma soon." "Otherwise your love affair will break. It will break." "Friend, why are you upset? Why are you upset?" "Krishna, what fight do you have with Radha?" "Please go and ask her that." "Friend, why are you upset? Why are you upset?" "You walk so swiftly, the deer gets misguided too." "The moon hides on watching your fair face." "The flowers shed when you talk." "The colours become vibrant when you smile." "The flowers shed when you talk." "The colours become vibrant when you smile." "Your killing looks impress me." Where have everyone gone? Master and madam have gone to attend a wedding.. And daughter-in-law has gone to attend the women society's function. To attend the women society's function? With who? With sister Vandana and Mr. Prakash. With Prakash? Come in. Oh, sorry. Is Vandana here? No. She has gone to meet the secretary of women's society. She must be coming. Please be seated. I don't understand how to thank you. The programme was a big success because of you. I was very worried. What would have happened if you didn't come? It would have been real bad. How you both could have got a chance to meet? - Mr. Basant! - Shut up! Come with me. - Come with me! - Leave my hand. I'm coming. Shut up! Did you think that I will never return? Either you or I will survive today. - Sister Vandana, where you had been? - What happened? Mr. Basant was very angry. He has forcefully dragged Poornima. - Mr. Basant? - Yes. So, you found an excuse to meet him as soon I left? It is a lie. Father had sent me. Stop your nonsense! Flirt and loose character lady! - Basant! - Shut up! Now, tell me. Will you perform at the show? Will you ever perform? Shame on you! What a brave man you are! If you want to test your ability then fight with some man.. Who can answer your thrashings of stick with a rod. Mind your tongue. Otherwise.. Otherwise what will you do? Vandana, why are you taking the blame? I'm destined to lead a miserable life. This world is not so good, Poonam. The more you will endure, you will be suppressed. You should give a solid reply in return. Will you go or shall I push you out? Try to touch me. Don't call me Vandana if I don't smash your face. What did you say? Listen. Vandana, please go away from here for God's sake. No. I'm responsible for taking you there.. And now, I will free you from his atrocities. I'll go and bring the police right now. Vandana! Vandana.. Stop! She will never be able to reach the police station. I'll kill her before that. No, no. I won't let you go. Kill me if you want. Shut up! We don't have any relation from today. - Get aside. - No. Stop! Or I'll kill you right now. Basant! Vandana. - Mr. Prakash, let's go soon. - What's wrong? - Come on, hurry up. - I say stop the car. - No. Stop the car or I'll kill you. You will also die if you'll kill me. Wretched lady, I'll see how you won't stop the car. - Leave me. - Stop the car. - Move aside. - Stop the car. Shove off. Vandana, stop! - I say stop the car. - No. Leave me. Vandana, stop there is danger ahead. No! Thanks for your sympathy. Please be seated. What's the matter, Mr. Radheram? Mr. Basant owes a loan. - Loan? - Yes. He had borrowed a loan from them. Loan? How much money? - About Rs.15 lakh. - 15 lakh? Where shall I get such a huge amount from? Do you all want me to become homeless? Should I wander from lane to lane? We've not come to make you homeless but to derive our loan. Okay, sir. Goodbye. No. Stop. His soul won't bear the burden of your loan. He is my son. He was my child, good or bad. Let me go bankrupt or become a beggar.. But after his death I can't hear anyone accusing him. Go. You will get your entire amount. Master, take me along too. How can a helpless person like me support you, Mangat? Everything is gone. I'll live in a starving condition with you. No, Mangat, I don't want to share my misfortune with you. - Master. - Okay. May God bless you all. Let's go. It is small but spacious and airy. I love it. - How did you like it, dear? - It's fantastic. She will definitely like it. She has wrecked the good one. What's wrong with you? Forget the past. Try to be happy with what you have. If we were destined to be happy.. Why had this unlucky girl come to our house as a bride? What is this poor girl's fault in this? Why don't you understand? It is completely her fault. She is unfortunate. She is responsible for our destruction. Fear God, Sharda. Fear God. If you want to allege, she can accuse us as unlucky too. She can say that she didn't get any peace.. Since the day she came to our house as a bride. We both snatched her husband from her forever. We have made her a widow. If she thinks so, why doesn't she go away from here? - Mother? - Yes. What do you have here now? Basant's mother, don't ever repeat this. She was our daughter-in-law earlier.. But now, she is our daughter. Anil and Poornima won't go away from my sight till I'm alive. You are out of your senses. You won't understand me. Remember, you will repent. She will make you beg one day. She'll make you beg. Dear, don't mind her talks. She used to really love Basant. He was her only son. She has gone mad with grief. She has forgotten what is right and wrong. Don't cry. Don't cry, my prince. My prince. Oh, my prince. Look, it's such a big ball. I ask, why does this family leave the child alone? Am I your servant that I'll always carry you? I say calm down. Become quiet. "Calm down, the result of love of two hearts." "Calm down, the darling nephew of your uncle." "Lullaby. Lullaby." "The women sing lullabies and make the children go to sleep." "The men can also do this." "Man, live long." "Now, there will be a test." "A test." "A test." Hey? You are crying again? "Smile, oh, darling." "Smile, oh, darling." "No flower is as beautiful.. As your face." "Smile, oh, darling." "Smile, oh, darling." "The cradle is rocking. Go to sleep." You are crying again? I say keep quiet. Don't I've any value? Keep quiet. "It's bad to cry. It is a tuneless melody." "It is the women who weep. The girls cry." "Why should my darling cry? Why should my child cry?" "The other children are so good." "They always smile. They never shed tears." "Everyone loves them. Everyone loves them." "Everyone loves them. Everyone loves them." "Look what I've become to make you smile." "Look what I've become to make you smile." "Sometimes I twist my waist, sometimes dance my glance." "I've a slim waist. I've a piercing glance." "Oh, my, my! My waist. Watch my waist." "Look how I twist my waist. My graceful waist." "Look how I blush. Look how I feel shy." "If anyone sees me without you.." "I fear this. He will keep a watch on me." "He will keep a watch on me." "He will keep a watch on me." "He will keep a watch on me." "He will keep a watch on me." "Dear, it was someone else's fault. Don't punish me." "No flower is as beautiful.. As your face." "Smile, oh, darling." "Smile, oh, darling." "You are under your mummy's oath. Your daddy's oath." "Stop crying. Don't be stubborn." "The one who eats grams with a smile becomes healthy." "The one who eats almonds while crying becomes weak." "The nightingale sang. The one who cries is a fool." "The nightingale sang. The one who cries is a fool." "He is a fool." "He is a fool." "He is a fool." "He is a fool." "Calm down, don't cry." "Please don't cry, dear." "Don't make a noise now. Don't make me bore." "Don't hurt me. Don't make me angry." "I request you. I beg at your feet." "Listen to me. Understand it." "Understand it. Understand it." I'm tired but still you don't understand, shameless boy. "If you still don't become silent, I'll smash your face." "No flower is as beautiful.. As your face." "Smile, oh, darling." "Smile, oh, darling." "Smile! Smile! Smile!" Sister, take milk. No, Brother. Stop delivering the milk to us from today. - Why? Won't little master drink milk? - No. He doesn't like milk anymore. - Grandfather, I love milk. - Yes, my child. Yes. - Where are you going, Father? - In search of some job. You had high blood pressure yesterday. The doctor has recommended you to take rest. The doctor is my old friend. He still sees me as Seth Ratanlal.. Who can rest for years on his telling. Whatever you say, I won't let you go without asking him. Silly, nothing will happen to me. I'm born with a long life. I wonder what else I have to see more. Look, this hand used to feed thousands of people yesterday. And today it can't give a drop of milk to his grandson. He will get everything if you are alive. Please take rest. No, dear, let me go. - I promise to visit the doctor too. Okay? - Yes. Sir, I don't understand how to explain you. You need complete rest. Complete rest. That is fine, Doctor. But what should I do? I'll have to do some work to feed.. My wife, widow daughter-in-law and orphan grandson. If I won't do this, then who will? But have you ever thought what will happen to them.. When you are no more? You are the support to those helpless ones. That's why I'm telling you to take care of your health. Take rest and continue the same medicine. 'But have you ever thought what will happen to them..' '..when you are no more?' 'What about them after you are no more?' 'What about them after you are no more?' "Oh, countrymen, you call woman a Goddess." "Sons of mothers and brothers of sisters, listen to my story." "Oh, countrymen, you call woman a Goddess." "Sons of mothers and brothers of sisters, listen to my story." "Please listen to my story." "I embraced the thorns which destiny spread on my path." "But I'm unfortunate that you didn't approve it too." "Such a typhoon arrived. Such a storm struck." "The queen of the palace became a beggar today." "Please listen to my story." "I wander from lane-to-lane today." "I'm starving without food." "The people flung coins but no one gave food." "Every heart is lousy, every night is hungry." "Lust has made everyone deceit." "Please listen to my story." "This little child is your own countryman." "When he begs from you, the sky will bow out of shame." "But still, it will have no effect on you." "This life is a game for you." "Please listen to my story." "Oh, countrymen, you call woman a Goddess." "Sons of mothers and brothers of sisters, listen to my story." "Please listen to my story." "Please listen to my story." Oh, God! Are you blind? Unlucky girl! See how you caused an ill omen? Had I not told you to stay out of my sight? It's is 'karwachauth' (fast observed by married women). It's a festival for women whose husbands are still alive. Tell me, why did you come in front of me? I had come to give Arun a drink of water. I understand everything. You did this deliberately. - No, that's not true. - Quiet! You dare call me a liar? If you consider yourself a paragon of honesty.. - Go stay with your father. - Mother.. I'm in no way related to you. Our relationship is finished. - Mother, you.. - Get out of my sight. I won't let you stay even a moment in this house. Get out. Get out of here. Why did your hands not break.. Before they struck our daughter-in-law? Don't you dare say anything to me. Whatever you want to say, say it to this wretched girl. She already brought about her own husband's death.. And now, wants to bring about my death as well. No, Mother. Everything was lost. Only compassion remained. Today, you finished that off as well. - But.. - Get out of my sight! May you have a long and happy married life. Today, seeing you both like this.. I feel like every dream of mine has come true. May God always preserve your union. Father, if I've ever made a mistake, please forgive me. I'm the one who should ask forgiveness. My newlywed daughter is leaving.. For her husband's place. And I'm so helpless as to stand.. Empty-handed in front of her. Instead of giving her something.. I want to ask for something. And I'm afraid that a father.. May be turned away empty-handed. Why would that ever be? At least try telling me. - Let Anil remain with us. - Father! I don't have the right to take a son away from his mother. But if he stays with us, the desolate life that stretches.. Ahead of us would be lit by his innocent presence. Say yes. Who would take better care of Anil than uncle? And we'll be staying in this very city, after all. We'll come meet him whenever we wish. Let it be, Prakash. I don't wish to sadden my daughter. No, Father. Your happiness matters more than mine. Anil will remain with you for as long as you wish. Bless you, dear. That's what I wanted to hear. All right. Come, let's go. Welcome. A warm welcome. Come in. Please, come on in. What are you standing there for? Perform the welcome ritual quickly. One moment. I'll perform it too. I'm dead. I don't have any money. Brother-in-law, lend me Re.1. I'll pay you back the day after tomorrow. May God preserve your union. Now, come on in. And now go on to your room. Go. Brother-in-law, your choice is fantastic. Why are you looking so vexed? My heart is burning. Shall I call the fire department to douse the fire? Don't joke. I told you, my heart is burning. It's I whose heart is burning. Unlike brother-in-law.. Lord didn't bless me with such a happy day. - What? - Nothing. I'm troubled, and you're in the mood for jokes? You know, Sunil's stepmother has arrived. She'll make the poor boy's life miserable. What are you saying? This poor lady is a very good sort. A kind-hearted soul. Let it be. I've seen a fine example of her goodness. She fell in love with brother.. But married someone else for money. I remember all that very well. I haven't forgotten it. Poonam, remember, you had once told me.. That life doesn't teach us to turn and call.. - But rather to move ahead. - Yes. But today, life and time have both turned back. It seems destiny realised its mistake while unfolding.. And turning time back, it started again.. At the very point where it had made the mistake. And it could also be that it took pity on me.. And for my happiness, it sent back my cooling Poornima. Munna! Where are you going, Son? - Outside, to sleep. - Why outside? Aunt Naina said that this is my stepmother.. And she will beat me. No, Son. You shouldn't say that. What your aunt Naina said was a lie. - I.. I'm your mother. - My mother? Yes. Come to your mother. Come. - Come, Son. - Mom! Mom, you won't go away now, will you? No, Son. I'll never go. - Mom, don't ride in a car. - Why? When mom rides in car, she doesn't come back. It won't be so. My son.. Enough, Mother. I'm getting late. Otherwise, the teacher will tell me to stand on the bench. Have breakfast first. Then go to school. No, Mother. I'm not at all hungry. Okay, bye. - Dad, bye. - Bye. Hey, wait! - You forgot again? - What? A kiss. Come on, give it quick. - My share is still remaining. - But I'm getting late. I don't want to hear any excuses. Give a cheek here. This sweet cheek is mom's. This sour one is yours. Fine. If not an orange, I'll make do with a lemon. - Which one is mine? - Me, first. - No. Me, first. - Me, first. - - Me, first. - Me, first. Do one thing. Both of you, get it together. - When I say, "Ready. One. Two. Go." Then kiss. - Okay. Ready? 1.2. Go. It's a good opportunity. Let's take it further. Why are you shushing me? You have no sense of time and place. What if someone comes in? - Shall I close the door? - Be quiet. - No, I won't be quiet. - Let go. - No, I won't be quiet. I won't. Hello? Yes. What did you say? All right, I'll be right there. - What happened? - Aunt is very ill. Let's go quickly. Doctor! Gautam's mother! If I have a worry now, it's only about Anil. He's an innocent child. He should have his meals on time. He should study on time. Now that your mother is no more.. There's no one in this house to take care of all that. So, I want to return your child to you. - Grandpa! - What is it, Son? Grandma has gone to heaven, hasn't she? - Yes, Son. - When will she come back? It'll be quite a while, Son. - Grandpa, I'll go to grandma. - No, Son. Don't say that. Son, your mother has come to fetch you. You'll go with her. That's why I brought Anil with me. It's a good thing. Your everyday bother is done with. Go, take him along and serve him dinner. Anil! Sunil! - How are you? - I'm fine. How are you? I'm fine too. You're here after quite a few days. Mom, I won't let Anil go back today. Yes, Son. He won't go anywhere now. - He'll stay with you. - Really? Yes. Now onwards, both my sons will stay with me. Great! It'll be great fun then. Come. So, finally, my worst fears came true. What happened? It was fine that he would visit occasionally. - But Anil staying here permanently isn't a good idea. - Why? Because his staying here would be a risk. Sunil would be spoilt staying with him. What are you saying, Naina? Anil is no thief or hooligan to spoil Sunil. Whose son is he, after all? The apple never falls far from the tree. You should feel ashamed to malign an innocent child. Innocent child? A rogue's child can never be innocent. - Don't forget who his father was, Brother. - Meenu! - A wretch, a rogue, an idiot. - Shut up! - That who Anil's father was. Get out of here. I say, get out! Fine. Destroy yourself as you please. Ruin your son in that wretched boy's company. Am I this house's live-in brother-in-law or the butler? I'm sometimes cutting potatoes, sometimes onions.. And sometimes pumpkins. I don't understand what my position is in this house. I've been reduced to a hired help. Oh, God. How can I do all the work alone? I still have to do the ironing. That iron is so hot! And I have to hang the clothes to dry as well. They're going to wring me dry one day. "Uncle, tell the truth." "Uncle, tell the truth." "Why do you slave for your wife?" "Why do you, a man, fear a woman?" "Son, my wretched fate.." "Son, my wretched fate.." "I ruined my own life." "I made a mess of my own life." "Son, my wretched fate.." "Son, I thought she was some delicate flower." "Some delicate flower." "But when I finally met her.." "She turned out to be a thorny shrub." "A thorny shrub." - "Really? - Yes." "Lord Krishna has turned his face away.." "From this wretched Chimanlal." "Gulfam was killed unnecessarily." "The coward has become a king now." "Gulfam was killed unnecessarily." "The coward has become a king now." "You've already spent your life, the rest you'll spend it the same way." - "The rest you'll spend it the same way. - Wonderful." "My luck never supports me." "That I get married soon after the engagement.." "That I get married soon after the engagement.." "Was my mother's wish." "She left for Lord's abode.." "leaving me balanced on the knife's edge." "Ever since, the quarrels escalated." "Enough! Enough!" "Ever since, the quarrels escalated." "She would thrash and abuse me a lot." "She would thrash and abuse you a lot." "Son, my wretched fate.." "Son, my wretched fate.." "I ruined my own life." "I made a mess of my own life." - "Uncle.. - Yes, tell me." - "Uncle.. - Tell me, Son." - "Uncle.. - Son.." - "Uncle.. - Yes.." - How is that? - Great. - It's truly realistic. - Then get ready. Aunt Naina.. Aunt Naina? - Aunt Naina? - What is it? You had told me to stop talking to Anil, right? I've ended our friendship. I'll never talk to him again. Well done. My son is very good. Aunt Naina, have you ever seen the pawn? - No. - Well, look to your heart's fill. Oh, God! I'll deal with you both right now. Wait, you idiots. I'll show you now. I'll deal with you now. Wait right there. Scamp.. Get lost. Let go. - Don't you have any shame to behave like that. - Help! - You're getting spoilt. - Wait. Why are you hitting him? How could I not hit him? Who are you to ask? Do I need to tell you that? If you hit the children again, I won't spare you. I'm hitting my brother's son, not your child. Naina! There's a limit to vileness. Don't you feel ashamed to pit such venom.. In front of the children? Don't ever say such a thing again. I'll say it not just once but a thousand times. Who are you to shut me up? I have more right to him than you do. What are you to him? Just his stepmother, right? - Stop your nonsense, or I'll kill you! - Poornima! I'm sick of these daily fights. What's going on here? Ask your mother. What right does she have to hit Sunil? The right a sister has on her brother's child. He's turned into a mischief-maker. Look what a plight he reduced me to, brother. Sunil, why did you do this? Aunt Naina was hitting Sunil. That's why he bit her. You be quiet. I'm not asking you. Being insolent with your aunt? Speak up! Children should be talked to gently, not thrashed. I don't like the behaviour he's indulging in now. Then tell her as well not to go after them. Come on. Did you see how he's gotten influenced by him? This is what I was worried about. His behaviour has changed since that wretch came here. Brother, if you still do nothing now, you'll regret it. It's been so many days now.. But the fever isn't coming down. I wonder what sort of medicine the doctor is prescribing. Surely, mother is suffering from some evil eye. Until we go to Lord Shiva's temple and make an offering.. Mother's health won't improve. Lord Shiva's temple? How do you know? When I fell ill, grandma went there and prayed. I got well then. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Come on quickly. But where's the money to buy offerings? Come on, let's ask dad for it. That's the problem. We can't tell anyone about the offering. If we tell anyone about the prayer.. Its effect will be finished and mother won't get well. - I know where to get the money. - Where? In dad's coat. I had seen him keeping it this morning. You go get the veneration things ready. I'll go get the money right away. - Stealing, you wretch? - No, I wasn't stealing. - Quiet! I'll hit you if you lie. - I'm not lying. You're as much a liar as your father. Come on. - Dad! - Don't you dare call me 'dad.' You're not my blood. You're in no way related to me. Come with me. Come along. - Take care of your son. - What's the matter? That which couldn't even have been imagined. He was stealing money from my wallet. He was stealing money? You were stealing? I wasn't stealing, Mother. Then why did you take the money? - Tell me. Why did you? Tell me! - I won't tell you. He's already doing this now. He'll go on to rob and murder. He's going on a very wrong path. I won't let him, as long as I live. Let alone you, even God can't stop him. No one can cleanse tainted blood. Prakash! Embers always light a fire. Flowers won't grow out of them. Letting Sunil remain in his company.. Was the worst mistake of my life. But now onwards, I won't let him anywhere near Sunil. Why did you steal? Tell me why you stole! Tell me! If you have to do the same thing.. May God kill me. Then do whatever you feel like. You steal! You steal! I'm not a thief, Mother. I'm not a thief. A lie! You're lying again! Why did you do it? Why? Mother, let go of Anil. He didn't steal. Don't hit him. He didn't steal. We were going to Lord Shiva's temple to pray for you. Look, the things for veneration. Anil.. You did all this for me. Why didn't you say so? Why? If I had, the prayer's effect would have been ruined. How would your fever come down then? My dear son.. Please forgive me. How could I ever have hit you? Munna, don't you dare go anywhere near him again. - Come on. - Listen. You misunderstood. Anil didn't.. I don't know anything about anyone. I'm only concerned about my son. Now onwards, they both will remain apart. That's my decision. Come on. - Dad! - Come on, Sunil. Come on, Son. Well done. Why have you come here? Get lost. Go! Anil.. I didn't like what dad said. And I don't like you crying either. See what nice firecrackers I've got you. No, Brother. If you give me those, dad will hit you. - He won't find out. - What if he finds out? Then I'll take the beating for you. All right? Come on. Here. Those are all for you. When they're finished, I'll get you more. I'd hit you before you did any such thing. You were told to keep away from him. Give those back. - I won't. - Yes, you will. - I won't. - Even your father would. Give those here. Come with me to brother. I'll tell him what you're up to. I won't go. How would you not go? I'll get you thrashed so thoroughly.. That you'll never even speak of this fellow again. - Come on. - I won't go. - How would you not go? - I won't go. - Come on. - I won't go. - Anil! - Forget Anil. - Anil! Anil! - Come on. Brother! Brother! Brother! What's going on here? Who did this? That wretched boy. No one listens to me. I'm leaving. Wait, Naina. I won't leave my own dear ones for outsiders. The one who should leave here will be the one to. Arrange for him to be sent away immediately. But where will he go? - I don't know. - Then how would I know? He'll stay where I do. I married you. I'm only responsible for you. I didn't take on your child as well. Did you think I would kill him once we were married.. Or leave him in some marketplace to beg? I didn't know that in getting married.. I was not settling down but starting an orphanage. - Prakash! - Where I'd have to rear that vile man's child. You haven't insulted him but me. You've thrown into my face that time of my life.. Which I wanted to forget. If you wanted to revile my past, why did you marry me? I hadn't begged you to marry me when I was a widow. I had married for his sake, for his future. If that's the case, then decide. Do you want your son or your husband? Both. I'm a mother as well as a wife. It's not possible to go through life straddling a fence. You'll have to choose one of the two. I want an answer. An answer! She won't give you an answer, I will. The one who brought upheaval in the lives.. Of you both isn't this child but this wretched woman. If you want to throw someone out, throw her. What did you say? If you glare at me, I'll slap you so hard you'll see double. - Chiman! - Brother-in-law! I can yell too. Instead of rebuking her, you're encouraging her. You allowed her to lead you astray into throwing.. That poor fatherless boy out of the house? I'm doing what I think is right. If sister-in-law had done what you're doing.. Think what your son's plight would have been now. She came into this house as a stepmother.. But loved him as her own son. She doted on your child and loved him as a mother. But you couldn't think of her son as yours! Don't talk nonsense! Get out of here! Let alone here, I'll be leaving this house. What's the good of staying in a house.. Where there's no compassion? Nonsense! Mother, I'm going to grandpa. Don't miss me. I'll come back later. Then you won't be quarrelling with dad. He'll be happy. You be happy too. - You? - Where are you going? - To grandpa. - To your grandpa? But where is he? His address is in this letter. All right, Brother. Take care of mother. Anil, I'll come along with you. No. The fights happen because of me. Both mother and dad love you. But I love you. Wherever we stay, we'll be together. No, don't get into this mess. No matter what, I won't let you go alone. Hadn't mother said that brothers.. Should support each other.. The way Lakshman supported Lord Rama? Come on. "A mother sacrifices her life for her children." "Today, these children, for the sake of their mother.." "Have set out to make the sacrifice." "See this strange game of fate." "See this strange game of fate." "In this world full of thorns.." "Two children have been parted from their home.." "And find themselves in a storm." "See this strange game of fate." "These innocent little kids.." "What's their fault?" "They don't know where they'll stay, having left home." "They don't know it." "A parent's love denied, thorns pricked at their smiles." "Two children have been parted from their home.." "And find themselves in a storm." "They find themselves in a storm." "See this strange game of fate." "They don't understand the way.." "One is held dear and the other an outsider." "Elders may feel ashamed at seeing.." "The selfless love of these." "It's as if they're of the same blood." "Two children have been parted from their home.." "And find themselves in a storm." "They find themselves in a storm." "In this world full of thorns.." "Two children have been parted from their home.." "And find themselves in a storm." "See this strange game of fate." - Sir, where's my grandpa? - Who is your grandpa? - Mr. Ratanlal. - Mr. Ratanlal? He's not here. He left by the morning train to go visit his grandson. - He left? - Yes, Son. What will happen now? What do I tell you, brother? Maybe even Lord is angry with us. Mr. Ratanlal, you didn't leave? I missed the morning train. I'm leaving now. - Father! - You are here? Is all well? Both children have run away from home. Run away? But why? - Dad! - What do we do? Run. Or he'll thrash us. Sunil! Sunil! Wait! Sunil, wait! Sunil, wait! Sunil, wait! Sunil! Sunil! Come back, Son! I won't say anything to you! Come back! Sunil! Sunil! Come back! - Dad! - Dad! - Dad! - What happened? What will happen now? Mother! Mother! Save them! Save them somehow! Mother! Mother! It'll be difficult for them to survive now. No! Oh, God! Mother! - Mother! - Mother! - Mother! - Mother! - Mother! - Sunil! - Wait, Son! I'm coming! - Sunil! Let go of me! It's my son out there! He'll drown! Let go of me! If you go into that water, you'll die as well. No! - Anil! - Anil! Come back. Otherwise you'll die too. Come back. Come back! What's the matter with him? - My son.. Open your eyes, Son. - What happened? Anil! Anil! Open your eyes, Son. I've had nothing but loss in my life. Don't give me more loss. Anil, why are you silent? Please say something. Call me 'mother.' Anil.. Say something, Son. Say something. Say something. No! Anil, Son.. He's still breathing. Pray. Anil.. Son, your grandpa is calling out to you. Say something, Son. I won't be able to survive your death. Say something, Son. Say something. Say something, Son. Say something. Say something, Son. Say something. - Grandpa.. - Anil! Anil! My son! Grandpa, don't leave me now. I'll stay with you. Don't leave me now, grandpa. No, Son. You won't go with your grandpa.. But with your father. Come to me. - Come. Come, Son. - Dad! Son, please forgive me. I was misguided by others. Please forgive me. I wonder how many children's lives are ruined.. Because of people like us. That won't be the case now. It won't. Come with me. Come.
