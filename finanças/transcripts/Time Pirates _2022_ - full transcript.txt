Land ahoy, Captain! Got you! Bugger you, Blackbeard. So close. Bali nuts! Where is he? Find Captain Cooper! Give us the map, Coop. Afraid to face old Blackbeard, are ye? Check down below. Aye-aye! Ye be Captain Cooper. Do you know why I'm here? The map. And I aim to have it. Step forward, and I may let you walk the plank. It's better than a poke in the eye with a rusty nail. Sorry. I'm all out of rusty nails. Come on. Come and get this. Come and get it! Hoo-hoo-hoo! Too slow. I still be faster than ye. Aah... Close. You won't be so lucky next time. Come on, old man. Hey, watch your tongue! I ain't that old. Give it up, Blackbeard. Your ambitions for Mystic Island outweigh your expertise. It's only but half a map. Useless to you. Take back your ship, we'll call it even. I might take both. Aah! Almost, huh? Oh! Never cross Blackbeard again, my friend. All right, all right. I'll give you what you want. Please! See? Was that so hard? Come on, make those little bones work. What is this writing on your arm? It's nothing. Pay it no regard. -Ex lovers? -No. -Maybe a poem. -No. Maybe a nice recipe. No, and whatever you do, don't read them out loud. -I will say these words. -No, don't. You do not tell me what to do. -Etlov ettes edicuu... -Don't... Assor... amad al. Oh, no! Oh! What have you done? I told you not to read the lines out loud. When did you say that? Who knows the consequences of where the map -and Elrod's treasure are now? -You didn't tell me something like this would happen. I told you not to read them! You bilge rat! I want Elrod's map and the treasure where it leads. -So do I, yeah. -I will put you in irons in my prison tower until you tell me what happened to The Red Queen, mark my words. That treasure will be mine, all mine! Well, you could be waiting a very long time. How long? Very. Welcome to Hollywood Now! -We're your hosts Rene... -And Alicia Herbert.

I have six wonderful performers shooting six different music videos. I need pirates, and you all are giving me pi-don'ts. But if we're pirates in the 1700s, why are we playing modern instruments? Shouldn't I have, like, a lute or something? -That's a point. -It's a music video. Nobody cares. Loot like we plundered a ship? No, no! Not loot! A lute! L-U-T-E, lute, you loon! Pirates in the 1700s didn't have distortion pedals on their lutes. I just got that pedal last week. -It doesn't sound like it. -Mm. Okay, wait. What if we've been captured by Blackbeard, but he's tied us up, and he's making us walk the plank? I could escape from my binds to save the day and free the rest of you. The end. You're welcome. Over here, troops! Listen to me, me, me. -Listen to me. -Sailing the high seas -looking for adventure. -And buried loot! And we could do this all by lunch! One hour. And not a minute longer. We still have magic to create. That's right. Yes, we do! Hey, let's go downstairs, see what kind of trouble we can get into. Maybe there's a dead parrot down there. "Polly wants your soul." Huh! This is so unsafe. I bet whoever's ship this was carried a lot of gold and treasure down here. Twenty bucks says I'm right. Jack? Argh, matey! Give me back me gold! Do not do that again! You got it, matey! You broke it. You're paying for that, not me. I broke it? You're the one that slammed into it -with your big bum. -I do not-- I do not have a big bum. Whoa. Whoa. What is it? "The Big Book o' Buccaneers." It's all about pirates. Hey, did you know Anne Bonny was more fearless than all the men on her ship? "When her crew was captured, she refused to give up even though the men on her command were hiding below deck." She said to them, "If there's a man among ye, you will come up and fight like the man you ought to be!" What was that noise? What did you break this time? Um, not much, but you gotta see what we found! We got a treasure map! We found it inside an old barrel on the lower deck. -After Adam broke it. -You actually broke something? Thanks a lot. We said we weren't gonna tell them about that part. It's a treasure map! -Treasure? -I found a book! -Yeah, that's great. -That's great, Emily. So, wait. You found this inside of a barrel? Yeah, that and a whole lot of sand. This is really old parchment. What's written on the back here? Et... Etlov. Here, Jack! Hold this!

Now you want me to touch the helm? I did it! I did it! I did it! Hey, I think I see a town over there. Now we just have to figure out how to stop the ship when we arrive. Oh, this must be another one of those challenges -you told us about! -Yeah. I never said those challenges would be easy! It says here we need to go down to the Hawser Hole and tie another rope to the anchor. - And then we drop it down-- - Got it! -Are you okay? -I guess that's one way to do it. The Red Queen. Hey, Emily, see if it's in the book. All the dates in these pages refer to the early 1700s. The 1700s? That was like a decade ago! Disco sucks! "Welcome to Port Royal, turn away now..." "Turn away now if you value your lives?" Here it is. Port Royal, Jamaica. What? Like, "the" Jamaica? That's impossible, guys! Jamaica is not in California. It's in Florida! "Jamaica. An infamous pirate stronghold, "the Port Royal township of Jamaica is populated "with the fiercest brigands, knaves, and scoundrels to ever disgrace these seven seas." Jamaica? We have a concert tomorrow night, opening date to our first headlining tour! And what about Mom and Dad? They're probably looking for us right now! They're gonna be so mad at us! We are so grounded. Guess what, guys? We don't even have our passports to be in another state! We are all going to jail! Let's backtrack. We were filming, and then we broke for lunch, and then we were running around the ship, and that's when you guys found-- The map! Wait a second. Wait a second. Are you saying that we've traveled back in time? -Maybe. -Hey! I guess that would make us Time Pirates! Okay, these words must be some kind of incantation. We must have ended up here after we sang them and-- We? We must have ended up here after I sang them. And we or I should be able to do it again to get us back home. -Do you have to sing it? -♪ And if you wanna ♪ ♪ Know the score, there's a place ♪ ♪ You never been before ♪ ♪ We're down for a battle royale ♪ He's doing the dance choreography, too. ♪ Just tell me etlov ettes ediccu assor amad al ♪ Huh. Maybe I should try it again and-- -No! -Maybe not the whole thing. Just try the strange incantation, no singing. Okay. Etlov ettes ediccu assor amad al! You suck. Well, that didn't work. Maybe this has something to do with it. Okay, that's not normal. I found it. Check this out. "The Red Queen was a frigate ship "that sailed Port Royal in 1717 under the command of Captain Miles Cooper." All we have to do is find Captain Cooper so we can get home again. Well, I think it's safe to say we've time traveled somehow. - Which would make us-- - Time Pirates, I know. We're starting a new settlement, looking for volunteers, a place for peace and harmony. Why, sure, honey. We'd be glad to join ye. Um, excuse me. Hello? Do you know where we can find -someone in charge? -Buy some fish? Excuse me, hi, pardon me, we're looking... never mind. Excuse me, hi, pardon. I'm looking for someone. We're stuck on a pirate ship, we need help and-- Anybody? Hey, let's check out the tavern. "The Hanging Cheat?" -Sounds charming. -Yeah. What could go wrong? Come on. This is not a good idea. Oh! Jeez. What is wrong with you? Oh! Don't you know how to eat and drink without throwing things? Come on. Who was it-- you-- Who do you think you are coming up in here, insulting me regular clientele? You bunch of pipsqueak scalawags! I'll cut you up and make a stew! No, ma'am. You see, we're the band. You're the band? Mm-hmm. Well, you're late! And don't be thinking I'm paying you full price for half a show! Where ye been? What kept ya? Oh, um... -it's kind of a long story. -Make it short! Okay, yeah, well, we were on this pirate ship filming a music video. You don't know what that this. We were on a pirate ship. I found this map, it had a strange incantation on it. My brother George turned it into a song, and I pretended to like it. But it sucked. I am so sorry. And this water spout then, it came out of the ceiling, sucked us up, and we were in the middle of the ocean. I had no idea where we were. I hate water! And then I had to drive this thing? I don't even have my license! I had to take the helm, the wheel, whatever the H-E-double hockey sticks you call it. And I dodged death. I took a rowboat all the way here. I think I saw a shark which was in the sky. So either I'm going crazy out of my mind, or this, this, this, this is not the 1700s and everybody here is dead! You're dead! You're dead! You're dead! Not you. You are all dead! Go play with mermaids! And, uh... Long story short, we don't really have our equipment, but we're really excited to be here. "Oh, we be the band, but we don't be havin' no instruments to be playin'." Well, don't think I'm gonna be helpin' ye either! What about those? Those are my tavern décor. You expectin' to be leavin' my walls bare? We'll put them right back after we're done, I promise. Please don't stab me. Fine. Go play. Don't play his song, but go! Go! Play! Yes, grab it, grab it.

But now it is my honor to introduce you to my most important clientele. Come, let's meet! It's her! Her who? It is my extreme honor to introduce you to-- -Anne Bonny! -Aye, 'tis. And this here's Beckett. She may not look like much and smell even worse, but Beckett here be one of the most loyal and honorable lasses you're ever bound to meet. Charmed and whatnot. Oy, Duke of Limbs over there. What? Duke of Limbs? She called you Duke of Limbs. Wait until I post about that on my Instagram page. Wait! I got it! We gotta do a TikTok challenge: Nicknames for George. Oh, I got the first one! Grumdy McScuttlebutt! Don't even think about it or I'll post pages from your diary on YouTube about the time you couldn't make Jell-O! You know, it's really hard to make Jell-O! And, second, it's not a diary. It is a journal. What's Oo-toob? Oh, yeah. We're from the future. We're Time Pirates. Oh? Ah, Lonnie! Thank ye, Lonnie! -Ahh! -All right. That's the salmagundi over there. It's a mixture of cabbage, tomatoes, different olives and things like that. And some rabbit and chicken and turtle, random fish and pigeon. You can really taste the pigeon. Her name was Fluffy, God rest her soul. Here in this bowl is the callaloo. No meat in that at all. It's just leafy greens, garlic, tomato, onion. -No meat. -Hey! Dig in, gang. There's nary a soul in all of Port Royal turnin' down Lonnie's cooking. -Eat! -Oh! So what brings ye to this corner of the world, music makers? Well, we're actually looking for someone. Captain Miles Cooper? Do you know where we can find him? I think ye be out of luck... -just like ol' Coop. -Aye. Rumor has it Blackbeard himself's taken the man and locked him away. Keeping him in irons until Cooper can provide the location of his ship. Serves the man right. He never be takin' risks like that without his crew. Aye, Blackbeard wants the map that's on his ship. His entire armada is scrounging the seven seas for The Red Queen. Sizable price on that vessel. Funny story about that. Who are ye and why did you steal The Red Queen? We didn't steal anything! Aye. Well, it used to be Blackbeard's ship. Made two of them identical, called 'em his pair of queens. He sees this on the seven seas, he's gonna want it back, and he ain't gonna go easy on ye. Nah. They have to be members of Cooper's crew. That's the only explanation. Cooper's crew? He hasn't become that desperate. Oi, what's this? Just what on Earth is this? Gimme it. It's my guitar. Take it! Take it! It's screaming as if Scratch himself jumped up from the depths! Okay, these are our instruments, and we need to keep 'em covered! Water and gear don't mix! All six of ye are spawns of the devil! Look, all we wanna do is get home. We have a concert we can't miss! Aw, this lot ain't a part of the crew. Use your eyes. Six landlubbers before ye plain as the nose on your face. How do you account for them havin' Cooper's ship then, eh? They didn't pop out of thin air with his vessel. Actually, that's why we need to find him. It's his ship that brought us here. We're just hoping he knows how it can bring us back home. This boy's a loon. Okay, you said Captain Cooper is locked up by Blackbeard. Blackbeard took up inside an old abandoned monastery to hide out while he ain't on the seas. He's got some kind of prison tower there. Breakin' in means certain death, ye askin' us to suffer? Well, if there's a man among ye, you'll come up and fight like the man you ought to be! Now where did you hear that? That's my line. You're mad, girlie. Ye expect us to merrily waltz into Blackbeard's confinement and escort the gentleman out of his imprisonment pretty as you please? She speaks naught but the truth of these light-timbered cowards. Now ye hold yer tongue, Bonny! If ye wish to get yerself killed, be me guest, but ye won't have me keel-hauled beneath Queen Anne's Revenge! Ye'd rather I gut you like a fish? Aye, I hear the sea water's very nice this time of year. Very... very warm. Glad to have you back onboard, lass. Remind me to never get on her bad side. I think the child's sick, Beckett. Seems there's somethin' in his eye. So how do we get into the monastery? Through Death's Head Cave. I don't like the sound of that at all. Aw, nothin' to be a-feared of. It just be the nickname of the place. And, besides, always do what ye be afraid of. That's Death's Head Cave? I thought you said it was just a nickname! 'Tis. The name on all the maps says it as Annihilation Island... after 'twas renamed. Before, it used to be called Extermination Enclave. And before that? Ye Olde Fantastic Fun Cave. It didn't stick. Ah, there she is, dead ahead! Can you not say that, please? Which part, the dead or the head? Both. There she is! Land ho! What's happening to us? Someone stole my finger. You look like a cartoon! -We are cartoons! -And I'm a princess! Watch out for the bear! I told you we should've played wizards in our music video. -This wasn't such a good idea. -Gee, ya think? -Oh-oh-oh! -Aah! Lightweights. Now shake it off and listen up. We survived. But now where we're headed is fraught with danger, and if they catch us, the punishment's severe. We take the rowboats from here. Blackbeard's compound not a far trip from here. We sneak in under moonlight, never see us comin'. Perfect. Beckett, you watch The Red Queen. And then we save Captain Cooper and bring him back to his ship! And then we'll be back in time for our concert! How are we gonna get past him? I'll take care of him-- Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa. -Why? -Can we do that? No, we got this! Come on. No visitors unless you're on Blackbeard's list! We came to see you. -To see me? -Yeah. Hey, the crickets here are insane. -The crickets? -Yeah. They're so loud. The crickets here are insane, very small. -Yeah? -Yeah. Where'd you get this from, mate? Relatives of Blackbeard. So, how do you know Blackbeard? Blackbeard was a friend of our dad's. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. So do you like cheese? -Cheese? -Yeah, cheese. - It's like-- - I suppose so. - Do you like-- - I like swords. Mmm, swords. -Are you all right, man? -Yeah. ♪ Anything can happen, we're crazy ♪ ♪ LA ♪ ♪ LA, yeah ♪ ♪ LA ♪ ♪ LA, yeah ♪ -Hey! -Guards! Come here! Let's go! Go, go, go! I got this. Oh, no! Run! -Come on, get up! -That ain't right! Aah! -Ooh! -Ooh! Adam's kicking butt, guys. Yeah, he is. Hey. My stunt double is awesome. -Go, me. -I think this is a good time to go get Captain Cooper while the guards are occupied. Good idea. -Right. -Yum. Ow! -Ha! -Aah! The Wifi down here must be just awful. Hey, look! Hey, look, it's-- Add musician name here! Yes, I am Social Media Sensation Pipe Raquel. SM6, are you here to be in my music video? You know this gal? Yeah! It's... Add musician name here. Oh, please. Social Media Sensation is just fine. Did you guys get sucked up into the time portal, too? -Yeah. -Yeah, pretty much. Do you need any help getting out of here or... Help? I love this place. I'm gonna shoot so many videos while I'm here. Um, we're looking for a Captain Miles Cooper. Coop! Great guy. Horrible breath. And terrible dancer, like terrible. Literally, like, he was-- I don't even know what he was doing. Don't tell him, but I'm gonna cut him out of, like, my whole video. He's over there. Cooper. Oh, no. Oh, my God. We're too late. I think he's dead. You think so? Who are you? Cooper! Oh, my God, what have they done to you? You came to rescue me. Ugh! -Turn your head. -What? No! I-- -Turn it. -No, no, I can't-- Oh! You said turn your-- I gotta block-- you should have said block your ears! -Aye, yer lucky I missed. -What? You're lucky I'm a good shot. Let's go! Where's me hat? Sorry, mate. Aye... Cooper. What? Move it, Cooper! I still can't hear you. -Bye! -Wait, guys. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Squad walk. Oh, no. They're just asking to get killed. Now pirate style. Who are these people? I'll explain later. -You can do this. -Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Okay, now. Okay, now. That's good. That's really good! -Yeah, you like that? -Yeah, that is really good! -Sound pretty good, yeah? -Great job! -We gotta go! Bye! -No, no, hey! Hey, mate. I really like those kids, man. The Red Queen! How? Those meddlin' kids! No. No! Aah, no! Tell me you have it! Tell me you have it! -Wait. -What? You mean the map? He's got pockets inside his pockets! The sand is running out. Time is once again not upon my side. You did a very noble thing, protecting this map with your life! Because mine rests upon its fate. Did you speak the incantation? Yes! Now we need to get home. Please tell us how we can do that. You can't! See, it's a time spell! Speak the words and it takes you away. Speak 'em again, it brings you back. Once you've departed and returned, it's expired. I get it. Like a roundtrip airline ticket. The first trip was already used. There was only one trip left, the one that brought us here. Time Spell? What Time Spell? What have you gotten yourself into now, Cooper? The map. It comes with a curse. Who put their curse upon ye? It was on account of the Crone. So it's her work. For what purpose? Well, you must understand. I didn't know the map had a curse. Where did you find this map anyways? Mystic Island. Where Jonas Elrod's treasure be buried? No, where Jonas be buried! He lay there clutching the map tightly like the dirty scoundrel he was. And now I'm bound to do one good deed, return the map to Mystic Island and claim the treasure before the hourglass runs out, or else I end up like Jonas Elrod, lying in a shallow grave. Sprung by a gang of men, you say. The most ruthless and violent I've come across. Oh, I be sure of nothin' else judging by the state of your appearance. Did you make out a face among the blaggards? Anne Bonny, she was among them. You just said Cooper was sprung by men. -No mention of a woman. -She's no woman. -It's Anne Bonny. -Shut your bone trap! If she be with Cooper, that means she's privy to the treasure and the island. Aye. Prepare Queen Anne's Revenge for battle. Aye, Captain. So this kind of stuff happens all the time here? Curses? Huge occupational hazard. -Happens all the time. -Why didn't you have the Crone lift her curse from ye before? What did she want from ye in return? And you don't think I tried to do that exactly? My dark Curse remains unbroken upon whomever holds this map lest proven worthy of the treasures that await or time... renders its ugly fate. Okay, but that doesn't explain how the Time Spell brought us here. I journeyed to the Crone! She wouldn't release me from the curse, and I asked if she'd assist me in another way. She obliged. She gave me a spell, one that would reset the hourglass, but only once, so I could have some more time to complete the task. But now I'm convinced that I wrote it down wrong, and... that's how the six of you are here. How can you mess that up? Well, it's like really hard to hear, in the Crone's keep. And she was mumblin', and I misunderstood her, so... The worst part is that you got it tattooed right there on your arm. -The boy's right. -Before you know it, he's gonna have "No Regerts." Okay, look, it was one simple mistake. It could have been a letter or a word. It changed the spell from a spell that went back in time to a spell that went through time, evidently the future. And when I saw The Red Queen vanish in front of me very eyes, well, I knew I'd stuffed up. There be no more of ye, right? It's only the six? There's not any small little ones laying around the ship or anything like that? - This is it, this-- - Yeah. It's a lot. It's, you know, tight spaces. It's just... it's hot. A lot of siblings all together. You were just complaining about not having enough crew members. Right. Well, yeah, that's a valid point. This side of the map's blank? I surmise that it will reveal itself once we get to Mystic Island, but only after I complete a good deed for somebody. Well, what about your rescuers? Yeah. Coop, you need to help solve a problem! We have a problem that needs help solving. Ye got this lot back home, that'd be a good enough deed, I'd say. The Crone be able to make 'em their own spell. It all depends on the whims of the Crone. See, she's a witch, old, ugly, scary-lookin', never smiles. In fact, I doubt she's ever smiled in her entire life. Don't be talking about me behind my back or I will come through this map and show you what a real curse is! Stop, Crone! Stop! Shut up, Crone! Aye, she could cook up your spell for ye, but she's have to be pleased with your offering first. And the Crone's keep lies far further than where the bravest men venture. We're ready. We'll do whatever it takes to make it, and I promise you we won't give up. Please? All right. Well, then to the Crone's keep we go! Make haste we will! Yes, all of this because of a song. Yeah, and it wasn't even finished either. It was gonna be a top-40 hit. We'd be on every talk show, every radio station. We'd break all chart records. Oh, you wish. A ship on the portside bow! That's Queen Anne's Revenge! Blackbeard's found us! -Hoist the Jolly Roger! -Hoist the Jolly Roger! All right, listen up! Ye both run gun crew. Fire only on me say-so. And ye two lasses are gonna be me quarter gunners, handing out the charges to the gun crew. Very important. And ye two lads are gonna be me powder monkeys, bringing the cartridges and the projectiles to the gun crews. What? Let me fire a cannon! Come on, I can do it! -Pipe down, powder monkey. -Aye, I'm sure of it. But I need big strong males to carry the heavy shot, or else we ain't gonna make it. Oh, you got the right strong male, m'lady. -Aye. -Man the positions! You heard the Captain! Move it! Load the cannon! Steady now, steady! No surrender, sir. The choice has been made. A shot across the starboard bow will make 'em reconsider. That be one warning shot! Blackbeard ain't known for giving ye two. That's right! The next one won't miss! Let's make 'em flinch first. Fire! Fire broadside at higher intervals! We need cover fire to hold 'em! Fire! We're hit! No one goes after my family! Lock and load, powder monkeys! We're taking heavy fire! We're not strong enough! The end is nigh! I'm sorry, kids. This was a very bad moment to come back in time. We can't just surrender! Blackbeard won't relent! He's got the upper hand! No way! We have the confidence! We're strong enough to survive! She's right! Let's give him a taste of sound and fury the likes of which he ain't never seen before! Sound and fury. Hey, Adam, what are you doing? This one's for you, Blackbeard! Son of a biscuit eater, what is that infernal sound? It's called rock and roll. Whoo! I am deeply concerned for you kids! The ship has been hexed! Stop that! You're scaring me! Please stop! Are you possessed? Your heads! You're injuring your heads! It can't be good for you. Throw them overboard! What are you doing? You're scaring the crap out of me! Bloody hell, stop! I'm going mad! Am I going mad? Why'd I start doing it? I'm not sure! Retreat, men, retreat! Cooper is in league with dark forces! By God, it's working! Blackbeard's retreating! Turn this tub around, full speed ahead! Thank you and good night. Nine of us bested Blackbeard's most ruthless and strong men today! We must journey fast to the Crone, get her to concoct your spell and you'll be on your way. But Blackbeard will be back! We're not scared of Blackbeard. Ah, Blackbeard be the most notorious pirate that's ever lived. Ne'er a man to underestimate. We could take him. Aye, aye. In positions! Let's go! -Haul the flags! -Aye-aye, captain! You know, I never did offer you my gratitude for helping those kids save me from Blackbeard's tower. Thank you. Don't take it as a change o' me mind on your proposal for wedlock. My answer still be a resoundin'... not on yer life. Aye. I heard you the first time. Always knew marriage to be a curse, and here ye are, with misfortune 'round your neck cause o' Ol' Elrod's treasure. And you can't devote yourself to a cursed man. I can do anything I set me mind to, but that'd be a waste of me brains. Is it Blackbeard that takes your fancy then? Oh, don't make me retch. So is it true then, you're eager to join a crew? Is this what ye got to offer? Not seeing much of one around. Besides, now I want me own crew. We'll make it to Mystic Island, lift the curse. And Elrod's treasure will help me start a new settlement, a haven where my sister and her boys can live in peace, far from Port Royal. That's your reason for going to Mystic in the first place. Half of Port Royal is underwater. What's left is overrun with criminals, cutthroats, and scoundrels. Hey, I resemble that remark. Not in the least. But you're all too happy to have the world believe it. Come with me, Anne. Start over. You're never wont for the charm, my dear Cooper. But it's not gonna work on me again. Unfurl the sails! Tie the lines! And put your eyes on again! Put your left leg out, shake it all about! Now do the hokey-pokey! Turn yourselves around! That's what it's all about! You taught him that, didn't you? -Yeah. -Yep. -We did. -Mm-hmm. Perfect. Ahoy, Time Pirates. Yes! Thank you! Yes! Time Pirates! See, she gets it! Ha! What you guys playing? Little bit of poker to pass the time. Hey, I got a great game I could show you guys. All right. Go Fish! It's too late to go fishing. Mm-hmm. Hey, guys, check this out. -Oh! -Aah! Witchcraft! Slit his throat. -What? -No! Got any fives? Go fish? I drew a five! I win! Ah, this stupid game! All right, take me fish. Take me for all I got. Who likes fishing anyway? Are we almost there yet? Aye, not much longer. So the Captain says it's dangerous. Aye, but life is to be lived for as long as you're able. I get the feeling no one around here has much of a long-term plan for the future. Pirates-- Pirates have a plan for the future. It's, um... it's to find treasure and eat, drink, and be merry. -Aye. -You see? Pirates face danger every day, so you enjoy the little luxuries while you can, right? I like the way this guy thinks. Mate, you really need to get that thing checked out. Aah! What was that? Was that her, the Crone screaming? No. Mermaids. Oh, jeez, we better get back to Jack and Ellie before Jack finds out that there are-- Mermaids! Oh, no! It's Ariel! And her scary friends! We've made it to the runnel of the keep... and mermaids. They protect the Crone against intruders. The mermaids will allow none to pass. Why not? What are they gonna do? Threaten us by singing a song? They destroy vessels with their screams! They'll tear the ship apart! What are you talking about? They're angry because they're oddities! -No one likes them! -They're aiming to sink us! -Aah! -Aah! What if we show them we're different, too?

We just walked into Mordor from Lord of the Rings. But we don't look like hobbits, George. Emily does. She's short like a hobbit. I do feel like Bilbo on an adventure right now. So... This doesn't feel right. Do we still have time to turn back to the ship? You'll do nothin' of the sort, ye white-livered cringeling. Stand watch outside, Beckett, and keep an eye out for Blackbeard. Captain, you have come back! I sense a great weight upon you. The curse. It remains. Yes. Pity. Well, it's... it's not me who comes before you today, but... Come closer, hobbits. Closer! You have journeyed a long way. Yes? None of you belong here! You! You spoke the wrong spell! You said Etlov, not Atlov! Yeah. No, you know, uh... Yeah, no, I-- -Enough! -Sorry. What is it you seek? We-- We are seeking... we need to get home, back home to our time period, to home, our time, home time. The future, back to the fu-- -No. -What? -Don't do that. -Okay. We need a Time Spell. I also... seek something... that has eluded me. Despair, anger, pain, misery, distrust, vanquisher of them all. Can you give us a second? Despair, anger, pain? Vanquisher of them all? Vanquisher? What does that even mean? Vanquish. It means to conquer. What's the one thing that conquers despair, misery, and pain? Wait. I know what it is.

That was-- That was good. That's good. We wanted to put a rainbow in your cloud and offer the thing you're seeking, a smile. I am pleased with your offering. You shall have what you seek.

Thank you so much! We should go, we should go. Oh, yeah, okay. -Thank you. -Run, run. And remember, Cooper, it's a dog that barks, not a dog that bites. That is one tiny scroll. Don't lose it. Don't worry. I'm not gonna lose it. We made it. So it looks like ye be leavin' us then. We could use the extra hands on deck. This has been an adventure that I'm sure none of us will ever forget, but we must go. Well, I guess this is where we part ways. Thank you for helping us get back home. Hopefully it'll break the curse and find your treasure. We'll miss you. Aww. And I shall miss the lot of ye, especially you two younglings. -Jack. -Where are they? -Ellie. -Where'd they go? -Ellie! -Jack! -Ellie! -Jack! Ellie! -Ellie! -Ellie! Hey! What is it? "The treasure in exchange for their lives. "Direct yer ship to Mystic Island "to make the trade. "Flip over to the other side. "I couldn't stab the knife into the rock "to show you how serious I am, so I drew one instead. Still, heed my warning! BB" Blackbeard has them. He took Jack and Ellie! He's not gonna get away with this. No one breaks up the band! Yeah! Squirm all ye want, but you're not going nowhere till Cooper give me the treasure. You let us go right now! Who do you think you are? Why, I'm Blackbeard, your worst nightmare. And this is my associate Two Pegs. Well, I aim to have two pegs someday. Take 'em down to the hole! I can't believe we lost them. My entire life I looked after them. The one time I turn my back, they're gone. It'll be all right. We find the treasure and we have them back in no time. And I promise ye, I will find Blackbeard, and I will make him regret the day he ever messed with ye. Cooper! Beckett, take the helm! Cooper? Cooper? Talk to me. The hourglass... It's nearing its end. The treasure. And if we don't find it in time... it'll be gone forever. Stay with me. It'll be all right. Stay with me. Man the ship! We're going to Mystic Island! Okay. It barely moved. Yes! Yes! Good work, Ellie! Untie me! What do we do now? It's time to get metal. Oh, it's definitely time to get metal. Blackbeard's gonna pay. Let's mess with stuff! Wait, dude! They're gonna hear us! Nah. I got the mute button. The other way, sir. There you go. Cooper, don't die on me before you give me my treasure. Don't you even think about dying. I really don't think he's gonna make it. Jonas Elrod. Aah! You'll never find the treasure, Coop. You're a dog with a bark, but no bite. You're doomed just the same as me. You cannot make it right. That's what happened to you, Jonas? Don't you know better than to tangle with the old Crone? Whoa, whoa, Isabel, come here, come here. I think the map is filling out! I think it's showing us the treasure! Guys! Guys, something's happening! Guys, come on! I think it's showing us the way! Come on, let's go this way! This way! The quicker we find that treasure, the sooner we'll get Ellie and Jack back. No, no. It has to be here somewhere! We've walked everywhere! All right, everyone start looking! It has to be here! I'm running out of time. What'd she say? The Crone? Elrod said it, too. A dog with a bark, not a bite. It's not a dog with a bite. Bark... tree bark. Knotted tree. It's a knotted tree. It's the knotted tree. Guys, look! It's a hole in the tree. It's like a keyhole! Emily, what are you doing? Just watch. Whoo! -We did it! -We did it! Jonas Elrod's treasure. We did it! All right... -back to the ship! -We have the treasure. Now let's trade it for Jack and Ellie! Cooper! Speak to me. I couldn't do it. I couldn't do one good deed. I've run out of time. No... you ain't gonna die on me. You were always the best for me. I wish that I could have been the best for you. Aye. But you were. It just wasn't our time. You're good kids. You make sure you get home safe, all right? Is there anything we can do? It's okay, it's okay. I got the treasure. It's only fair we share it... in death. Cooper, because you acted in the service of others, the curse is lifted. Cooper! Oh! The treasure! Back to the ship! We need to save those two young'uns! Blackbeard, he's... going to Mystic Island. Drop the treasure! Drop it! I see ye brought me me prize, Cooper. Where are Ellie and Jack? That was the deal! Their lives for the treasure. I changed the deal. Pray I don't change it any further. Anna, don't. Protect the kids. Live to fight another day. Drop your weapons! Looks like you had a string of bad luck, Cooper. I always had the belief... that having younglings onboard -was nothing but trouble. -Then you'd be best to return the ones on your ship to us. You'd be wise to watch your own necks. Besides, I'll be throwing them overboard anyways. You're gonna pay for this. Oh... I think I have enough to spare. Tie 'em up! You won't get away with this! It'll be all right. Okay, what's the plan, guys? Is there a plan? Any plan? We're stuck on this island! George Jones, don't you say that! Don't you even think it! We need to rescue those younglings before it's too late. We're not going anywhere! We're not even moving! Okay, wait, wait! Everyone hold up! We're struggling against each other, and it's not doing us any good. We're bound together, right? So if we work together, we can get loose. Guys, guys, push in against one another! Closer! As close as you can get! Cooper! Anne! Twist in place! Now twist and shout! We're almost there! You're strangling me! Tighter! As tight as you can go! Any tighter, and I'll be a pancake! Come on! Good, you're almost there! You're almost there! Good! Go! Good, good, good! Good! You're good! You're free! Yeah, we did it! Yay, teamwork! Yay, teamwork? Yes! No, no, hey! High-five. -High-five? -Yeah. High-five. Good job, you know? High-five, right. -Good job. -Yeah, yeah. High-five. High-five. Okay. Okay. Ow! Yes, smack-five. Oh, okay. Yeah, Captain. Marco, Polo, fill 'em up! Wait! Look out over there on the water. Cooper, they're changing course. Jack and Ellie have to be on Blackbeard's boat. Everyone in the boat! Go! Go! In the boat! Do you think it's the same treasure Captain Cooper was looking for? That might mean Blackbeard stole it from them. Maybe he took everyone prisoner and they're on the ship here with us. Come on, Jack. They might need our help. Come on, Jack. Enough! It's the irons until ye all rot! Grr! Faster! Come on, guys! Row! Row! Just in time to bid your friends and family farewell. Load cannons and fire upon the lifeboat. What happened in here? Where's all the ammo? -Come on. -Call off the attack! You are such a loser! Loser. That be a good thing? -No. -Send 'em overboard!
