Some people often forget To take their coffee break THE LANGUAGE OF PERSUASION They get tired, sleepy, depressed Life can't run smoothly Without a coffee break I think it's about time To take a coffee break There's nothing better in this world Than a coffee break It breaks the ice in any situation... Without even noticing, you are being dominated. May this summer bring us plenty of sun, plenty of beach time, plenty of love, plenty of joy and plenty of mineral water. To enjoy all of this... A voice that's always with you tells you what to do to please men, to conquer the woman of your dreams, to make your money grow and show. It says you must be up to date, ready for summer, successful, in the know. It says that you'll wear a maxi skirt and be super. A comfortable, sumptuous, smooth domination takes hold of you. A system of information that does not explain or demonstrate, leaves no room for alternatives. Mass communication, a language that says at every instant what you should do from morning to night. “Buy, drink, smoke, lose weight, read, look, walk, stop.” At every moment, a poster or a shop window asks you to look and obey. TV, radio, movies, newspapers, fashion, all have been transformed into a vehicle for this comfortable domination, even when you're having fun. Don't give me any of your false sympathy. It just makes me mad. The example of the hero, always good and obedient, as you should be, shows the solution to your problems. Sex, religion, lack of money and sentimentalism make you more docile. Doctor, what's wrong with my leg? I want to move it, but I can't. Okay, let's wait then. From the TV screen, the cliché enters your home. Without realizing it, you enter into the stereotyped world of the characters, the enchanted realm of consumers. Heavens! Second class? What are you talking about? Pardon me, I'm talking about Omo! The idea of purity associated with religion is used to sell washing detergent. Well, Sister, using Omo? Now what do you think of the other brands?

In the huge supermarket that is the city, among the diversity of similar choices, the product must be identified, singled out by a special design, by the color of its packaging, by its unmistakable image. Aluisio Magalhães, industrial designer, explains. There are many products in the stores today. It's possible that the consumer, faced with such a large quantity and diversity of products, finds it difficult to choose. It's also possible that the nature of the product itself and its appearance influences this choice, the selection of one product over another. We were contacted by the linen company Capibaribe. Our challenge was to design a packaging system that would help to identify the three product lines that the manufacturer offers consumers. The brand name Capibaribe itself was used as the fulcrum for this classification. Therefore, “Capi” became the name of the most economical product. “Capiba” was used for the mid-range product, and “Capibaribe” for the highest quality product. The same principle is applied to the entire image of the company, identifying and creating what truly constitutes a corporate image. As an example, we can look at the brochure showing the products produced by the manufacturer, or even examples like the shipping packaging, or these publicity trinkets and giveaways. All of them bear the same kind of identification, the same form of showcasing, singling out and making clear the identity of the product. The modern world needs schools to train the designers of its new image. In specialized schools, professionals in window display, posters and store decoration are being trained. The schools which train professionals in visual communication are educating the technicians of this new persuasive and efficient language. They're educating those responsible for the commercial success of a new product or the mass acceptance of a new trend. Where could you be On this empty afternoon So clear and endless?

The Language of Persuasion was restored from the original sound negatives. The sound negative, however, showed early signs of crystalization. The original film sync was retained. Digital 2K restoration was completed in São Paulo in June of 2004.
