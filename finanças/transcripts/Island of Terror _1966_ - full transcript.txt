[man] Steady as you go. Steady now, steady. All right, let's have it on the truck. Is that all they need? Yes, I think so. How long will it take to fill the order this time? Probably three to four weeks. They ought to give us better service. And a boat coming once a week is not enough. You'd think at least they'd get our telephones installed. - They promised them this year. - Yeah, and last. - Morning, Campbell, Peter, Ian. - Morning, Dr. Landers. - I'd like to mail these people. - More books, Doctor? You islanders are too hardy. I have to do something to keep busy. You know, Doctor, you and I should take up chess. I've got nothing to do either, except when Andy McCracken has a wee drop too much and tries to break up the pub. Why don't you try talking to Dr. Phillips over there? He doesn't like company much. That's why he picked as isolated a place as this. No contact with the mainland. - He's an odd one. - He's not really. He's one of the top research men in the world. Researchers are like that. We wouldn't mind a bit of contact. They don't care about us because we don't pay enough taxes. - Ain't that right, Constable? - You speak for yourself, Ian. [chuckling] You know what? It smells like fog. Nonsense. I think it's gonna be a lovely evening. If you weren't a newcomer, you'd feel it in your bones. A newcomer? I've been here for ten years. A newcomer just the same. [chuckling] [liquid bubbling] Good. The cell cultures are prepared, we are ready to begin. What about Rome, New York, Tokyo? Are we going ahead without hearing from them? Yes, I've mailed them full reports this morning. They'll start as soon as they get them. The potential across the cell membrane must be maintained during the radiation of the nucleus. - Is the tritium state complete? - Yes. - And the vapor applicator? - It's been corrected. The histo-connect problem has been solved. - There shouldn't be any snags. - Good. Now that we've received the infusion equipment, I'm certain they will understand my reason for going ahead. I've waited a long time for this moment. If we're successful today, it may well be that we have the cure for cancer. [glass shattering] [ominous sound] [slurping sound] [screaming] - [screaming stops] - [thud] [gurgling sound] [knocking] - Ah, Mrs. Bellows, come in. - Thank you. Go over there by the fire. What brings you out on a night like this? I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm worried about Ian. He hasn't come home. Well, sit down. I'll get you some tea. Oh, no, thank you. No, no, settle down, and just tell me all about it. Ian hasn't come home, he's three hours late. That isn't like him. I'm afraid something's happened to him. Ah, I'm sure nothing's happened. Did you try the pub? Yes, and they haven't seen him. I've been all round the village. I'll tell you what, I'll look about for him, you go home and I'll have a run with him. Don't think he's had an accident? Ah, no, I'm sure everything's all right. I'll take a look at your north field near Phillips' house. Now you go on home and don't you be worrying. I'll do as you say, Constable. I'm sorry for being a nuisance. You're no nuisance. That's what I'm here for. Thank you very much indeed. Ian! Ian Bellows! Ian! - [rapid knocking] - [Constable] Dr. Landers! Dr. Landers! - Oh, thank God you're in. - You're in a state. - I am. I am. - Come in. Come in. - Sit over there. - Right. Now, tell me, what's happened? Now, listen, you know that I'm not a man that's easily shaken. - I know. Would you like a drink? - No, no, no. I've just seen something, and by all that's holy, I just can't be sure, but I think it's Ian Bellows. You think it's Ian? What's happened to him? I don't know, his body is all like jelly. - Jelly! - Aye. It's like nothing I've ever seen. There was no face, just a horrible mush with the eyes sitting in it. Where did this happen? Up near the peninsula, on the path to Parson's Cove. - Did anyone else see it? - No, no, I don't think so. Come on, I'll get my hat and coat. We'll go over there. It's a body, but I can't recognize it. - Those are Ian Bellow's clothes. - Yes. - What's happened to him? - I don't know. I don't know. As far as I can tell, the body doesn't seem to have any bones. No bones? [Dr. Landers] Look. - You see. - Aye. I'll have to make a closer examination. We'll have to get it back to the village. I'll go get something to carry it on. I'll wait here. Hurry up, will you? Well, it's definitely Ian. I recognized the appendectomy scar and birth mark. My God. What am I going to tell Mrs. Bellows? I'll come with you. I'll give her a sedative. God knows, she'll need it. Don't mention anything to her about the condition of the body. No, of course not. I understand. In fact, I don't want this mentioned to anyone. Well, they'll have to know soon enough. Not until I find out what we're dealing with. What are you going to do? First, I'll go and see Phillips, I need expert help. This is quite beyond my knowledge. What if he won't help, or can't? I'll take the emergency launch and go and see Brian Stanley in London. Don't forget, that launch is our only contact with the mainland, in case we need help. Don't worry, I'll come back immediately. Who is this Brian Stanley? He's the most eminent pathologist in Great Britain. Whatever this disease is, it's virulent and could be contagious. We can't take chances. By the way, we might fly back, so build a signal fire on Moor Heights. Right. That'll be all for today, gentlemen. I... I do hope that something of what I've been saying has penetrated. Judging from your last papers, I doubt if any of you will progress beyond first aid. - [laughter] - Good day. [indistinct chatter] - Oh, Dr. Stanley. - Yes? This is Dr. Landers. Oh, yes, I heard your telephone message. How do you do? - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - I practice on Peter's Island. - Where the devil's that? Off the east coast of Ireland. Ah, yes. And what can I do for you? Doctor, do you know of any disease that could completely dissolve human bone? No, I don't. Why do you ask? We've discovered a body without any trace of bone in it. No bone? Are you certain? - Quite certain. - That's unbelievable. You haven't heard of anything like this before? No, nothing even remotely like it. I was hoping you could help me. There was no trace of bone whatsoever? None. If that's true, it's beyond me. It's true. I performed a complete autopsy. Hmm. - Have you heard of David West? - I think so, yes. He's the most qualified man on bone disease that I know. I suggest we see what we can find in the Medical Library. If that doesn't give us anything, we'll see David. - If you think he'll help. - If anyone can, he can. I couldn't find your bathrobe. I'm sure you don't find the female anatomy so shocking, Doctor. It's a bit different from Harley St. How's your dress? Oh, the spot's out, but I'm afraid it'll take some time to dry. Cured beautifully, don't you think? I'm afraid the credit isn't all mine. Excellent cognac, David. Coming from an expert, that's a compliment. You shouldn't believe everything you read in the newspapers about me, they exaggerate. Everything about you seems exaggerated. You're too charming. To think I had to break a leg to meet you. Not to mention writing off a very expensive Maserati. You should be flattered. It isn't every girl who goes to such lengths to meet a man. Besides, I'm sure it's going to be worth it, isn't it? I may not get places as fast as a Maserati. But you do get there eventually, don't you? Eventually. - When? - I'll let you know. Don't take too long. You might run out of petrol on the last lap. [door buzzer rings] You've got a pit stop or the checkered flag? I don't know, but in the meantime, you'll find my dressing gown in the bathroom. Brian, what the devil do you want at this time of night? Good evening, David. I hope we're interrupting something. Dr. David West, may I present Dr. Reginald Landers. How do you do? I think he's brought you quite an interesting problem. Uh, yes, well, you see, I've already got an interesting problem for tonight. - Good evening. - Good evening. I see we are interrupting something. Miss Toni Merrill, may I introduce Dr. Brian Stanley, Dr. Reginald Landers. - How do you do? - How do you do? I do hope you'll excuse my dress. It seems David's better with a scalpel than he is opening a bottle of wine. Reginald practices on some damn little island off the Irish coast. He's found a body without any trace of bone. [clears his throat] No bones? Yes, well, of course, this is quite a common-- - I'm serious, doctor. - I'm sorry, doctor. I didn't mean to imply any lack of ability, but this is rather difficult to accept. - I can show you the body. - He did a complete autopsy. - No bones? - No bones. Any outward signs? Contusions or lacerations? Not a trace. That's why we're tossing it into your lap. You're the young genius. I hate to disappoint you, gentlemen, but I've never heard of anything like this. What was the medical history? Practically no medical history. He was a strong, healthy farmer. - Interesting problem, eh? - Very. I'd like to see the body. I was planning on going up to have a look at it myself. Like to come? - Yes. - Good. When you discover what it is, I'm sure they'll call it "West's Disease." This sudden humility astounds me, Brian. They've named so many after me, it's liable to cause confusion. When are you planning on leaving? Tonight. But we'll have to charter a plane. You could use my father's plane. We need a sea plane. - It's a helicopter. - That's nice of you, Toni. - Ah, but there's a catch. - I should've known. - I'm going with you. - No, no. That's impossible. We don't know what we're up against. David's right, it's an unknown disease, we can't anticipate the effects. Nevertheless, I'm going. - Time is important, gentlemen. - Quite so, quite. Yes, I know. Very well then, we accept your offer and the condition. Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I'll telephone my father. We'll stop by my lab and pick up equipment. Right. I won't be able to wait for you. Your father needs the helicopter first thing in the morning. That's all right, is it? We don't seem to have much choice. I'll come back as soon as I can. It might take a couple of days. All right. Looks like we'll be marooned on the island for a few days. This means we won't have any contact with the mainland. I can't take the emergency launch back with me. It's too late to make any other arrangements now. - We'll just have to make do. - I'm sorry. I had no idea my father would be using the helicopter. What the devil did Napoleon do on that island of his to keep himself busy? He invented solitaire. - I've a better game in mind. - Can three play? Fascinating game, solitaire. [helicopter approaching] Hello, John. How's Mrs. Bellows? - Those pills did the trick. - Good. Oh, this is Constable Harris, may I introduce Dr. Stanley, - Miss Merrill and Dr. West. - [both] How do you do? Does anyone on the island know about Ian? No. Have you been in touch with Phillips? No, he still won't answer. - Phillips? - Dr. Lawrence Phillips. Oh, Dr. Phillips. What's he doing out here? This is where he set up his laboratory. He could be a great help. You've got to get to him first. He's quite a recluse. Who is he? What does he do? Top man in cancer research. Well, before we do anything, let's go and look at that body. Not a very pretty sight. I intend to make the first incision here. Agreed? Agreed. Here's something interesting. There are a series of minute punctures in this dermal segment, look. That's odd. Let's collect segments from other parts of the body. Try staining it with eosin, all right? - It's the same with all of them. - They're all over the body. I've never seen anything like these punctures before. Something could have entered the body through those punctures? Like what, for instance? It's possible that some kind of enzyme was introduced into the body through the punctures. If they are punctures. I mean, I can't tell if they open inwards or outwards. They could be punctures or ruptures. Something came out or some organism producing an enzyme went in. There's not one trace of calcium phosphate in the whole body. Then this enzyme, or whatever it is, seems to attack and break down the calcium phosphate. A major component of human bone. We still don't know if there's a connection between the perforations and the absence of bone. They could be simply two evidences of a similar syndrome. We'll have to assume it. If we only had more complete laboratory facilities. There's Phillips' lab, but I don't know if he'll talk to us. - He'll talk to me. - How well equipped is he? I've never seen it, but I believe it's quite complete. Don't tell me the lights are going to fail. We have been having trouble with that generator recently. - Let's get to Phillips' place. - All right. I better leave a note for Constable Harris at his house, just in case. What a climate! How do they stay healthy? Does that generator supply all the light on this island? All the electrical power. I've been after them for months to fix it. - Is that the house up there? - That's it. Good Lord, it looks like Wuthering Heights. [bell rings] - Try again. - [bell rings] I don't think it'll do much good. We must get into that lab somehow. I'll have a look around the side. Got a torch in the car? Yes, I have. - Here we are. - Thanks. You wait here. I'll find a way in. - I've found another body. - The same as the other? Where's the laboratory? I don't know. I've never been here before. Come on, we'll find it. Let's try down here! Isotopes. He's got as much equipment here as I have at the University. There's the lab. [water bubbling] There's one over here, as well. Were there signs of a struggle where you found Bellows? You couldn't really tell, it was in a cave. Since Phillips had no contact with the villagers, we can rule out a contagious disease. Whatever it was, it must've started in this lab. Bellows' body was found not far away. If it did start here, it might be moving down the peninsula towards the village. From the look of this place, they were fighting something, or the death throes were pretty violent. Why don't we collect Phillips' notes and study them? It could give us a lead on what happened. All right. [humming] - [knocking] - [scoffs] - [continues humming] - [knocking] All right, all right, hold on, I'm coming! Ah, come in, you're just in time for a cup of tea. John, I found one of my horses dead. At least I think it's one of my horses. It's all soft and flabby. - Where did this happen? - In my field. I've got to go and tell Dr. Landers about this. He's up at Phillips' place, according to this note. Then I'll go down, take a look at your horse. In the meantime, don't mention this to anyone. Why not? Don't ask a lot of foolish questions, just do as I say. Go on about your business. I'll let you know everything in a little while. While you get started, I'll go over and tell Harris we're back. Right. Meet us here, we've got a lot of material to go over. I'll be back shortly. I could do with food and a lot of coffee. It's been a hard day. [doorbell rings] Dr. Landers? Dr. Landers? Dr. Landers? Dr. Landers? [ominous sound] [screams] [buzzer rings] I tell you, it was a horrible looking mess. - Good morning, Dr. Landers. - Good morning. Has anyone seen Constable Harris? He said he'd meet you at Phillips' place. He's gone up to my fields to look at my horse. What's that? I said he'd look for you at the Phillips' place. My horse is dead and he's gone up there. - What happened to your horse? - If it is my horse. It's a bloody mess, a pile of flesh. - In your fields? - Yeah. - The other side of the island... - What did you say? Nothing. Excuse me, Peter, I've got to be going. Wait, what's going on around here? I can't explain now. Some peculiar goings on going on on this island. It was a bit abrupt on the doctor's part. You may be right. I'll go and see Campbell. You're the head of the island, what do you plan to do? Well, it's no good dithering about. We better go and talk to some of the farmers and then see Dr. Landers. One of the islanders found his horse on the other side of the peninsula, the same thing. Constable Harris has gone up to Phillips' place. We must've missed him when we came back. Did you find anything? Phillips was certainly working on cancer research. He was trying to create some form of living matter to counteract the cancer cells. What do you think? Simply that he might've succeeded in creating some form of life up there in his lab. That caused these deaths? Perhaps. We haven't gotten very far into these notes. Do you want me to go up and look at that dead horse, then we can pick up Harris? We should let him know what's going on, at least as much as we know. - Good morning. - Hello, Toni. You look as though you've been up all night. We have. - How about some breakfast? - We've just had supper. We have to go up to Phillips' place now. Right, let's go. - I'm afraid you can't come. - Why not? - It might be dangerous. - What might? Look, last night we went up there and found four more bodies. Now, we think they created something in that laboratory that's causing all these deaths. - What do you mean "something"? - Just that-- We don't know what we're up against yet. Listen, if you think there's something running loose on this island, you can't leave me alone. - Toni, this could be-- - Please! Don't leave me alone. Perhaps you're right. - [ominous sound] - [thud] [scraping sound] [screaming] Oh, no! What is it? What's happened? There was something on the rear window. - What? - I'm not quite sure. - What did it look like? - It was... I don't know, it was greyish. Oh, I don't know! Think carefully, this is important. There was a strange sound. - What kind of a sound? - I don't know-- Let's have a look. Brian, hold it! Come back to the car. If there's something in there, we better not get too close until we know what we're up against. - What do you think is in there? - I don't know, but let's not take any unnecessary risks. Especially with me. We better get Harris and go back to the village. We might need some help. He must be here, that's his bicycle. Toni, stay in the car. I'm not staying here with all those things running around. Let her come, I wouldn't want to stay here alone. It's too creepy. All right, but let's stick close together. Harris? Constable Harris? Harris? Let's see if he's in the basement. Harris? Look! It's Harris. [ominous sound] Good Lord, what's that? Come on, let's get out of here. Don't get too close! - [gasps] - [gurgling sound] [screaming] - [gasping] - [gurgling] They've divided! - Let's try and get through them. - Wait! Let me try first. Come on! [gasping] No, no. - We've got to. Now. Come on! - Oh, no! You can make it, hurry! They may not remain inactive long. Listen to me! They're inactive now because they divided, but we don't know for how long, and we can't stay here, so come on! - Oh, David, I'm so frightened. - So am I. - Are you all right? - No! - There's one out here. - Into the car, quick! [ominous sound] [engine revs, doesn't start] Damn! - Hurry! - I'm trying! I think that's got it. Here, take this. - Now, come on, drink it. - Oh, David... Come on. I want you to get some sleep and this will do the trick. Oh, I'm so scared. I've never seen anyone die before. Now, don't think about it. We'll find an answer, we've got to. I never saw anything so horrible. Neither have I. Now, you just relax and try and get some sleep. - What's going to happen to us? - Nothing, we'll be all right. - Are you sure? - Of course. I'm just sorry I brought you here. Oh, there's no reason for you to be sorry. I wanted to come. - David? - Yes. Are you really sorry I came? - I won't let you down. - I know you won't. [exhales deeply] We'll get out of this somehow. Somehow. How is she? I gave her a sedative. She's resting. Good. I could do with a sedative myself. What did you find out? I've got them in chronological order. The last notes are a couple of days old. What's the entry? Seem to be just a personal note, something about Phillips' dog getting an overdose - of radiation. - Anything else? They attempted to get the nuclei to fuse. But look at this protein structure. It isn't adenosine triphosphate. Hmm. [vehicle approaching] Where have you been? I've come for my goods. Sorry, Jonesy, the store's been closed today. - Have you seen Dr. Landers? - Not since 7:00 this morning. He left in his car with two men and a girl. - Strangers. - What strangers? The ones that came in on the plane, last night. What plane? Where are they? - Maybe they've over at the inn. - Come on. Hey, what about my goods? - If you check that with 404... - Hmm. -...you see? Hello. Are you the folk that are with Dr. Landers? We've been working with him. Yes. Who are you? I'm Roger Campbell, the head of the island, and this is Peter Argyle who runs the general store. How do you do? I'm Dr. West and this is Dr. Stanley. - How do you do? - How do you do? And where's the Doc, Dr. Landers? I'm afraid Dr. Landers is dead. Dr. Landers dead? How did it happen? Won't you please sit down. Well? Now this is very difficult to explain. There are creatures loose on this island. They're dangerous. What do you mean? What are they? We're not sure, but we believe they're the result of Dr. Phillips' experiments. What do you mean "creatures"? I wish I could tell you more, but we don't know what they are. Creatures? Doctor, this is a bit hard to take. I assure you we're not mad. Dr. Phillips', in the course of his experiments, created some kind of living organism that kills. And that's what happened to Dr. Landers? Yes. We'll need a lot of help if this island is going to survive. - Survive? - What do you want us to do? First of all, I'll need ten good men besides yourselves. I can find those for you, all right. Good. Then get all the villagers together in an hour. That's short notice. Well, I think we can get them together in the meeting hall. Right. I'll let you know everything more fully then. Right. We'd better go and tell the Constable. I'm sorry, you're too late. He's dead. - The Constable too? - Yes, and Ian Bellows. Oh. You know, we have had reports of animals dying. - Seems as if they had no bones. - Yes, where did these happen? Several places. In the northern part of the island. Has anything occurred near the center of the island? No, just north of the center. We haven't time, they're moving. - How many are there? - We'll explain everything. We've got to finish these notes. - We'll do as you say. - Thank you. They tried experiment 1165... Yes. And if you compare that with 1143, you can see that the results were negative. [loud chatter] [banging] Quiet! Quiet, please! Now, that's all we know at the moment. [loud chatter] May I have your attention, please. I'm Dr. West and this is Dr. Stanley. We've completed going over Dr. Phillips' notes. I must warn you that we're faced with a very dangerous situation. Dr. Stanley? Let me explain what we have discovered so far. In order to understand the nature of cancer, Dr. Phillips was trying to create living cells, cells that he hoped would attack the cancer. He based his creation on the carbon atom which is the basis of all life on this planet. He did not succeed. But he probably succeeded in creating a form of life based on the silicon atom. Now these Silicates, as we call them, eat animal bone, - human bone. - [loud chatter] You see, Dr. Phillips' gave life to some kind of organism, something that we know nothing about. They have an external skeletal structure which is tough and resilient. Dr. Landers couldn't hurt it with an axe and when run over one, it was unharmed. [Dr. Stanley] We... We haven't found a way to destroy them yet, but we intend to attack them with everything we can. From Dr. Phillips' notes and our own experience with them, we calculate that these creatures divide every six hours. There are about 64 silicates on the island at this moment. [loud chatter] There'll be 128 by six o'clock this evening. [loud chatter] Two hundred and fifty-six by midnight. And if the multiplication continues, until the end of the week, there'll be a million of them. [crowd shouting] Now, please, I must have your attention! Please! The only ultimate way to stop them if all attempts fails, is to deny them food. We want all of you to move into this building with supplies, we want the cattle brought to this end of the island. You must keep calm. Fear and panic will defeat us just as surely as the Silicates. We need all your help and your co-operation. We must work together. Thank you. Right. Now, uh... The following men meet me in the room out the back there. Uh, Morton, uh, Dunley... - Are there guns on the island? - Plenty. - And what about dynamite? - I've got three cases - at the store. - Good. We ought to make petrol bombs as well, we just don't know what'll work with those things. We'll send out three scouts: here, here and there. Dunley, you and two others. The rest of you, gather up the equipment and meet... here. You all know the groups assigned to you. Uh, Williams and Martindale, will you round up the cattle and bring them along to William's field there, close by the village? Right, let's get moving. Can I rely on you to see that everything's handled at the meeting hall? - Of course, I think I can cope. - Fine. Make sure all the supplies are organized properly and try and keep them from panicking. - I will. David? - Hm? - Take care. - I'll do my best. Don't worry, we'll be back, whether we destroy them or not. [ominous sound] How many of them can you count? About 25, as far as I can see. - Have you got everything? - I think so. - Where's the Geiger counter? - What do you need that for? If those things are radioactive, we'll have to protect ourselves against radiation. Hey, there, give us a hand. Halsey, you and your men take the dynamite. Morton, you bring the petrol bombs. It's no good, we hit it several times. They don't seem to be moving very fast. I'll cross that one's trail and get a Geiger reading. - Careful. Don't get too near. - Don't worry. Careful! There's one right behind you! - Nasty little creatures. - We better try the petrol bombs. There wasn't any sign of radioactivity. Well, that's something, anyway. The rest of you stay here. [explosion] [explosion] I'll get up closer. All right, but watch it. [explosion] Try another! - [screaming] - [gurgling sound] Here! Stop! Come back here, you! Come on, let's try the dynamite. Right, everybody spread out. All right, light them up. [explosion] Nothing seems to get through to them. At this rate, they'll reach the village by midnight. What else could we do? - Starve them. - Mr. Campbell! What is it, Dunley? In... Parson's Cove... It's one of the Silicates. It's dead. Are you sure? It hasn't moved for 20 minutes. And another thing, that Great Dane of Phillips' is nearby, half eaten. Phillips' dog! Remember in the notes, the dog had an overdose of radiation. Let's have the Geiger counter. Here it is, and the dog's over there. [electrical humming] [electrical humming increases] It's loaded with radioactivity. [electrical humming] Radioactive too. Let's put them both on the truck and take them to the clinic. Take it round the back! [people chattering] David, I'm so glad you're here, they're starting to panic. All right, take it easy. [dog barks] Will you please listen to me. - Will you listen to me, please?! - [dogs bark] I've something of great importance to tell you. I think we've found a way to destroy the Silicates. [crowd chattering] But we'll need the help of everyone here. We'll examine a dead one. I think it'll give us the information we need. In the meantime, you must all stay here and listen to Miss Merrill, do as she says. Can you stop them? Your job is to keep the people here, and keep them busy at all costs. I'll try, but what have you found out? I haven't time to explain. We'll be in the clinic if you need us. The outer shell is impenetrable. We've done everything we can to pierce it. - We know radiation kills them. - How? The dog was contaminated with strontium 90, that effects the bone. The Silicate ate the bone plus the strontium 90. - That's why it died. - The problem is, how do we introduce the radiation into their systems? Can it be done? Phillips' had a supply of isotopes. If we can get enough Strontium 90 at his place, we can contaminate the cattle. The Silicates eat the cattle and, well, anyway, it's a hope. Can you move the cattle closer to the village to keep them away from the Silicates until we're ready? Yes, we can put them in my cattle yard. Then do so immediately. Dr. Stanley and I are going up to Phillips' place. If we don't come back, you'll have to get the Strontium 90. - But we don't know-- - We'll tell you what to do. Dave, stop the car. - What is it? - Look over there. Silicates. [ominous sound] There are more of them. I'm not very keen on going down in that cellar again. It looks safe. [liquid bubbling] There must be some instrument that they used to contaminate the animals when they were experimenting. I'll have a look around. - What about this? - That's it. Better put these on. [air hissing] - I forgot the gloves. - I'll put this in the car. Right. David! David! - Brian, I-- - You must, you must! [gurgling sound] [gasps] [ominous sound] - Can you hold that? - Yes. Keys, in the boot. Try and hang on until we get back. - Thank you, nurse. - How are you feeling? - As well as can be expected. - He's had a lot of pain. - Not much. - I'll give you another morphine. First you do a rather sloppy bit of surgery, now you're turning me into a drug addict. - It's your choice. - I don't need it. All right, but we we'll give you another transfusion. One more transfusion and I'll be a full-blooded Irishman. [chuckling] I think he's feeling a little better. - Is that all the cattle? - That's all. Most of them. Very few escaped the round-up. Let's hope we've got enough Strontium 90. Herd them through one at a time. That's the lot. I had to cut down the shots on the last few. - Do you think it'll be enough? - I don't know. Let's get back to the hall. Got to get those lights strung up. You've done it. - Give us a bulb. - Here, take this. Uh, yeah, that's it. Well, what if it doesn't work? Then we'll just have to stay here until they send help. Our biggest worry is that they'll panic. They must be made to understand. They're scared to death. So am I. We're all scared. If they go outside, it's certain death. Those things will be all over the building, won't they? Probably. Now, look, you've got to keep the people calm down, they trust you. I'll do my best. [people shouting] The lights that we strung up are a strain on the generator. - That'd really cause a panic. - I've got torches and candles. Let's pray we don't have to use them. We've food to last for a week anyway. You've got to convince the villagers of that. Our one hope is that the Silicates will starve if the Strontium doesn't work, or at least the lack of food may cut down the multiplication. Are you going out front to have a look? Yes, but I'm gonna see Stanley first. I'll talk to the people. You move around amongst them and keep them occupied. Get help from Dunley and some of the others. Right. I've injected the cattle, but we ran short of Strontium 90. So I had to cut down the amount on the last few. If it doesn't work, we'll just have to sit tight 'til your helicopter arrives, or the boat. When will the Silicates get here? It's a little after ten. According to the last positions, about an hour and a half. What about the division time? Well, that may take some time, and there aren't that many cattle. But you get some rest. A perfect time for a nap. You will let me know if anything unusual happens, won't you? We've got to get out of here. Where can we go? We can't reach the mainland. If you'd seen what that thing did to Archie, you'd swim. Halsey! Shut up. Listen all of you, if anyone leaves this building, they'll be killed for sure. We're safe enough in here. We've got enough food and water to wait. I'm so frightened, Mr. Campbell. If you do as we say, you've nothing to fear. - Will you trust me? - Yes. Now, listen, Halsey, and listen well. If I hear another sound out of you, I'll smash your face in and throw you out for those things. I'm talking to you straight, do you understand? - I can't stand it anymore-- - Do you understand? Mind that you do. There's nothing to fear. We'll be all right as long as we stay here. - Are you sure? - Sure. Why, I've stuffed this place with supplies on credit. He's a much better color, he'll rest now. Now what? I think you could use some rest too, young lady. Oh, I suppose we all could, really. - Why don't you go and lie down? - I'd rather not, not now. - David? - Hm? Do you really think we're gonna get out of this? Well, I think we stand a very good chance, yes. But you don't believe that, do you? Not 100%, no, but I'd like to believe it. Toni? I've never been... I've never been much good at... being serious with a woman before now, but... If we get out of this, I will-- Shh. Don't say anything more. Not here, not now. Yes, I'd better be getting outside, it's nearly midnight. - David? - Hm. Be careful. I love you. [cows mooing] The cattle are getting restless. Aye, they're moving around a lot. How are the people taking things? Oh, I think it'll be all right. Some of the boys are moving around, keeping the talk going. - Good. - [cows mooing loudly] [ominous sound] How many, do you think? Hard to tell. About 100. - And they didn't divide. - It doesn't look like it. Well, this is it. It's a nightmare. It's all over. They're coming this way. - They're not stopping. - No. - Good Lord, look! - They're dividing. That means the effect of the Strontium will be halved. I'd hoped it'd work before they divided. We'd better get inside. [people chattering] Tell the people it may take time for the Strontium to work. - Will it work? - I wish I knew. [groaning] - Brian, they've divided. - What does that mean? That the power and effect of the Strontium is cut in half. Did they divide before or after they ate the cattle? - After. - That's something. - Not much, but it's something. - How's your arm? I'm trying not to think about it. It may take time for the Strontium to work. - If it works. - [ominous sound] [people shouting] - I don't like this. - The generator's had it. - They're coming. - I can hear. I'd better talk to them. - Quiet everyone! Please! - Hold it! - Please try and be quiet! - Now don't panic. We expected them around the building. We've gotta give it time to work. [people shouting] Light the candles and the lanterns. Take it easy! Take it easy! Quiet, please. Quiet. That's what I was afraid of. They're frightened without the light. - If they start breaking out-- - I know. Come on, we've got a job to do. - What's happened to the lights? - Quiet! I told you to be careful, they're panicking as it is. - I'm sorry. - We've got to set an example. [ominous sound] I'm not staying here. I'll shoot anyone that moves, I mean it. I'll shoot anyone that moves. Get back to your places, keep away from windows and the door. - Look out! - [people screaming] [man screams] [gurgling sound] Get to the clinic, as many as you can! [man] Let us in! Open the door! They're breaking into the hall! Take care of her, I'll be back! David, wait! [people shouting] Come on, quickly, block it! Quick, bring anything you can! Quickly, bring it over here! Toni, hold on. I'm trying, but I'm so frightened. [sobbing] I'm frightened. [shouting continues] [ominous sound] No place else to go. Hold it! I think they're getting weaker. [clattering] Careful. Come on, give me a hand with this thing. We've done it, they're dead. - Oh, David! - Darling, it's all over. We're all right now. And now my hand itches. Oh, shut up, Brian. Watch it, boy, or I'll sue you for malpractice. As soon as we get on, we'll radio ahead for aid. We'll need a help to clean up the island, bury the dead. They'll send everything, should be here by this afternoon. I wish Phillips had never started this thing. No, Phillips was just trying to help humanity. Science has its risks, but the risks aren't enough to hinder progress. Have you searched the island thoroughly? Yes, several times. We killed them all, I'm certain of that. I shudder every time I think of those things. Don't think about them, just try to get them out of your mind. - It's easier said than done. - I know. What's going to happen to the villagers? We'll send back help. You know, we were lucky this is an island. If it had happened anywhere else, I don't think we would've been able to destroyed them. [ominous sound] - [man screams] - [gurgling sound] [glass shatters]
