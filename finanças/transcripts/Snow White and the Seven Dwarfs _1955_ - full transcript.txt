- [Narrator] Once upon a time in deep, deep winter, when the snowflakes were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window with a black ebony frame, sewing. (uplifting music) And as she looked up from her sewing at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And because the red looked so beautiful against the white snow, she thought to herself, oh, if only I might have a child with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as the ebony window frame. (inspiring orchestral music) ♪ You are the one I've been dreaming of ♪ ♪ My precious gift from Heaven above ♪ ♪ Angel of mine ♪ ♪ Have come with you ♪ ♪ Snow White ♪ ♪ I love you so ♪ - [Narrator] But when the child was born, the queen died. (inspiring orchestral music) After a year, the king took a second. She was a beautiful woman, but she was proud and haughty, and could not bear the thought that anyone should be more beautiful than she. She owned a magic mirror that always told her the truth, and every day she asked it. - Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? - [Mirror] Lady Queen, you are the fairest one of all. (ominous music) - [Narrator] Snow White grew up and became more and more beautiful, and when she was 16, she was as lovely as a bright sunny day, and even more beautiful than the queen herself. (uplifting music) And everywhere, all through the country, people talked of Snow White's beauty. And when the handsomest and richest prince in all the land heard about her, he decided to come to the castle to see for himself. (inspiring orchestral music) - Halt! - Out of the way, I've come to see Snow White. - Let him pass. Why have you come here, Prince Charming? - I want to see Snow White. - No one may enter the castle, the queen has given me strict orders. - But I demand to see Snow White. - The queen fears that Snow White has become even fairer than she herself, therefore she keeps Snow White a prisoner. The princess is not allowed to leave the castle. Come and look. There she is. (uplifting music) - How lovely Snow White is. Hunter, you must promise to come for me if the princess is ever in danger. - I promise you, Your Highness, if Snow White ever needs you, I will come and get you. - Tell her she's the fairest of all. And give her this gift for me, it's a necklace. I want her to wear it and think of me 'till I come back again. - I shall go to her at once with your present. - Thank you, Hunter. And you won't forget what you've promised. If Snow White is in danger, come for me. - I give you my word, Prince. (inspiring orchestral music) - [Hunter] Princess. - Hm? - Princess Snow White, I have a surprise here for you. - What is it, Hunter? - It's a present from Prince Charming. He saw you standing at the window and asked me if I could let him in, but of course I couldn't. He wanted to speak to you. Then he told me to give you this present. That necklace is for the fairest woman in the land. He wishes you to wear it 'till he comes back again. (suspenseful music) (gasps) - A necklace for the fairest woman in the land. Then it belongs to me, give it to me. - The necklace is mine. The prince gave it to me as a gift. - Your Highness, that is the truth. - Give me that necklace. - The queen's coming! - What do you want? - Your Highness, the carriage is waiting for you. - I shall not go out today. Leave me alone. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? - [Mirror] Lady Queen, you are fairest here, it's true, but Snow White is 1,000 times more fair than you. - Snow White, you say, is fairer than I? 1,000 times fairer than I? - Snow White is 1,000 times more fair than you. (shushes) - Francisca! Francisca! Have you been listening? - No, Your Highness, I would never dream of listening. - Send in the hunter. - Yes, Your Highness. (ominous music) - Come here. I have something for you to do. - I am at your service, Your Highness. - I cannot stand the sight of Snow White any longer. Take her to the woods and kill her. - No, Your Highness, I can't do that. Little Snow White, that good dear child? - That good dear child is beginning to get in my way. Good dear child. - Your Highness, I can't-- - Hunter! I am your queen, I command you. - I can't do it. - And if I offered you 1,000 gold pieces? - I wouldn't kill Snow White for money, whatever you offered. - So you defy your queen, do you? Then the rest of your life will be spent in a dungeon. Well now, will you do as I command you, yes or no? What's your answer? - Yes, Your Highness. - Good. Go at once and take Snow White into the woods, and do what you'll have to do. - Your Highness, I... - Go! And not a word of this to anyone. (foreboding music) (somber music) - Attention, it's the princess! - I've been told I should be careful when I go into the wood, but all the animals are my friends. - That's right. - I hope we're lucky enough to see a deer. Do you believe we will, Hunter? - We might. - Or a nightingale, or an owl, staring at us with eyes as big as saucers! - Uh-huh. (serene music) - Oh, look at them! - Come on, Snow White, we have a long way to go yet. - Hunter, listen. (owl hoots) Up there! - The owl's awake. Now that it's dark, he'll hunt for food. Come on, we still have further to go. - I won't go any further. Hunter, take me back. Aren't we going to go home now? - Snow White, you will never go back to the castle. - Don't talk like that, Hunter, it scares me. Why do you look at me like that? What's wrong, did I do something? - The queen is an evil woman. She has ordered me to-- - What? - She has ordered me to-- - Tell me, Hunter, what is it? - She said I was to kill you. (suspenseful music) - Oh I beg you, Hunter, please don't kill me. I'll stay here alone in the woods, the queen will never know about it. - The queen made me promise I would kill you. But I cannot do it, Snow White. Here is the necklace, the one the prince gave to you. - Hunter, come back! Don't go away! Don't leave me! I'm fright! Hunter, where are you? Come back! Hunter! Hunter!

My father is the king of this whole land. - Snow White. - What a beautiful name. - She's a real princess. - Who rides everywhere in a golden coach. - How did you come here? - Did you lose your way? - How did you find our house, Snow White? - My stepmother sent me all alone into the woods with the hunter. He was supposed to kill me. - What? - How could she do a thing like that? - But the hunter's a good man and he spared my life. - Well, it's a lucky thing you found our house. - Sure is, who knows what could've happened to you. - I guess I'd better be going now. - But where will you go? - Why do you have to leave? - You can't just go out into the forest. - Why don't you stay with us? - Yes, Snow White, stay here with us. - Oh please, Snow White, do stay. - Oh yes, please, Snow White, oh please. - Please stay here. - Do you really want me to stay here with you? - Yes! - Shall I cook for you? - Yes! - And keep everything clean? - Oh please do! - And wash all the dishes? - Yes! - Do the sewing and mending? - Yeah, look at this hole in my pants!

And in the evenings, we'll play lots of games. - Hey watch me, look what I can do, I can turn cartwheels! - Can you really? - So can I, look! - Oh let me see. - I can crow like a rooster. - Oh show me! (crows) Oh! (laughs) - And I can quack like a duck, watch me! (quacks) - Very good, Bimbam. (applauds) (dwarves clamor) - Hey, let's have some music! (plays inspiring tune) - Ah, music.

But somebody else was not sleeping that night. (bell rings) Look, the wicked queen is still awake. Oh, she's waiting for the hunter. - Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? - [Mirror] Lady Queen, you are fairest here, it's true, but over the seven mountains far away, where the seven dwarfs stay, Snow White is 1,000 times more fair than you. - Snow White is alive. So the hunter didn't kill her after all. (ominous music) Francisca! Francisca! - Yes, Your Highness. - Has the hunter returned yet? - Yes, he came back a few minutes ago. - Bring him here at once. (knocking) Yes? - Your Highness, the hunter. - Your Highness, you sent for me? - Snow White is alive. You disobeyed my order. The order of your queen. - I couldn't do it, Your Highness. I couldn't kill Snow White. - You'll pay for this for the rest of your life. Guards! - Don't be too hard on me, Your Highness, I tell you, I just couldn't do it. - Silence. Throw the hunter into the dungeon. Keep him on bread and water. (ominous music) - [Narrator] What do you suppose the wicked queen is doing? Oh, she's disguising herself in some old clothes so that Snow White won't recognize her. (serene music) What do you think will happen when the wicked queen finds Snow White? Oh, isn't it lucky that the dwarfs are still at home? Let's hope they can protect her. - Boy is this good. - Best breakfast we've ever had. - You sure know how to cook, Snow White. - Did everyone enjoy his breakfast this morning? (dwarfs clamor) And did all of you clean your plates? Who's going to help me tidy up, then? - I will! - So will I! - Fine, you two help me clear the table, and the rest of you start tidying up the house. - Yeah. - Okay. - Come on, fellas!

She looked completely different. - Yes, yes, it was her! - She dressed herself up as a peddler woman so that you wouldn't recognize her. - She's sure to be back, so don't trust anyone. - And don't buy a belt from anyone. - And don't let anybody come into the house. - Now I won't let anyone in again. - I'm so glad that Snow White is alive and well!

And she got ready to go over the seven mountains to the dwarfs' house once again. - Good morning, my child. Would you have a cup of water for a tired old woman? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. Could I sit down and rest for a little while? - Of course, over there. Oh, what wonderful combs. - Do you like them, dear? I have lots more in my basket. Ivory, tortoise, golden combs. Why don't we go into the house? - I can't allow anyone in at all, the seven dwarfs have forbidden it. - You're absolutely right, you shouldn't let anybody in. But there's no reason why we shouldn't choose a comb out here. How do you like this one? - Very much. - I'll put it in for you. What lovely hair you have.

Why doesn't she move or speak to us? - Oh poor Snow White, we must never leave her alone, do you hear? - No, no, we must never leave her alone again. - Maybe the wicked queen was here again. - Yes, yes, I bet that was it. - She probably put on a different disguise, and Snow White didn't recognize her again. - Look at this. A comb! - Where did it come from? - She's opening her eyes. - She's alive! - She's alive! - The comb is poisoned. - It must have been the wicked queen. - Of course it was. - Yeah, she must have given Snow White the comb, that old bag. - Come on, let's pick Snow White up and take her into the house. - Easy now. - Careful. - [Blacky] Steady now, watch out for the steps. - [Eddy] Hey, not so fast! - Careful of the door. Watch out for her head. Put her down gently, that's the way. - Leave her just like that for the moment, I must look this up in my medicine book. - But I'm gonna put this on her, to cool her forehead. - [Whitey] Okay, I've got to look this up very carefully, so that I don't make any mistakes. - Look, she's better already. - Yes, she is. - I'm glad we decided to come home early. - [Bimbam] Whitey, have you found anything yet? - [Eddy] No, he's still looking through the book. - Here it is, she should stay in bed and be covered up and get warm. - She must stay in bed. - And be covered up. - And kept warm. - Come on, our pillows will help. - Yes, and our blankets, too. (serene music) - She must also drink three cups of green mint tea, then she'll be alright again. Snow White, you must never do this again. - Mm-mm. - [Narrator] Of course the wicked queen had found out through her magic mirror that Snow White was still alive, so once again she busied herself thinking up a terrible scheme. That very night, she searched through her book of witchcraft. This time, she was determined not to fail. (foreboding music) - She will die this time. I shall kill Snow White, even if it costs me my life. With the deadly poison in this apple, I'll destroy Snow White forever. (cackles) (suspenseful music) - Hunter, wake up. Come here. Quickly! The queen is going to kill Snow White with a poisoned apple. - How do you know? (shushes) - I was listening behind the door, I heard her say so. - I must go right away and warn the prince, as I promised. - How can I get you out of there? I don't know where the key is. - There, it's hanging over there. - Where? - Over there on the wall. Quick, here, it's the big one. - Yes, here it is. (suspenseful music) The queen! We'll have to hurry, the prince must come to help Snow White. It's very foggy, so no one will see you, go on! - Ready? - Not quite. - [Eddy] Come on, you're always the last. - Snow White, don't let anyone in the house. - The wicked queen may come back again. - The queen is sure to try and persuade you to buy something from her again. She'll never leave you in peace. - Never. - Don't buy anything! - And no one in the house, do you hear? - Don't you worry, I'll be careful this time. - Come on then, let's go! - Goodbye, everybody!

Snow White is dead. (somber music) - Someone's coming. - Stand in front of the coffin! - The seven dwarfs. - Why have you two come here? - We're looking for Snow White, the king's daughter. - You're looking for Snow White? - Who are you, anyway? - I'm Prince Charming. - The wicked queen is trying to kill Snow White. That's why I brought the prince here. - But we haven't found a trace of her anywhere. - You can stop your search now. - Snow White is dead. - Dead? - The wicked queen did kill her. - Give me Snow White. I'll give you a rich reward. - No, no! - We wouldn't exchange Snow White for anything in the world. - Dear little dwarfs, I have been searching all over the land for her. The necklace that she is wearing was a present from me. - Was it really? - I love Snow White, and cannot live away from her. Give me her coffin. - Over here, everybody. - Snow White must stay here. - Why does he wanna take her away? - We won't let him, we'll keep her here with us. - [Blacky] But he seems so much in love with Snow White. - [Teddy] Yes he does, but all the same, she's ours. - [Bimbam] But look at him, he looks so sad. - [Whitey] And Snow White always wore his necklace. - Perhaps she loves him too. - Could be. - Prince, since you love Snow White so very much, you can take her with you. - Thank you, you good little dwarfs. I'll take Snow White back to my palace, and I'll honor and cherish her forever and ever. - Come on. - Hunter, get the horses and follow us. (solemn music) (gasps) - You clumsy nitwit! - Wasn't my fault, I tripped, why do you always blame me? - Can't you even keep on your feet? Snow White! Snow White is alive! - Snow White. - She's moving. - She's opening her eyes! - [Whitey] She can't really have been dead, after all. - Look there, a piece of apple. - I bet it was poisoned! - The bump must have knocked it out of her throat. - Yes, yes, of course! - Yes, yes! - Hunter, come and look, Snow White's alive! Come on, let's help her out of the coffin. Careful now. Watch out you don't trip again. Easy, that's it. - Snow White. (serene music) (blows inspiring tune) - This is the necklace which you gave to me. I was to wear it until you came back again. - Snow White, we'll go back home to my castle, and then we'll get married without a moment's delay, yes? - Yes. (dwarfs cheer) (quacks) - And then we'll all have a wonderful party. (dwarfs cheer) - And you can all eat as much as you want. (dwarfs clamor) - And you'll come and live at my castle. - What's the matter? Don't you want to come to the palace? - Yes, but, you see, Snow White, we're not used to the world of big people. - We don't really want to leave our little house in the woods. - But we'll give you a party, here in the woods. - I'd like it. - Oh I'd love that! - Wait and see, we dwarfs can throw the greatest parties in the world! - Yes! - We are happy little people. - Yes, I can see that. Come on then, off to the wedding feast. (dwarfs cheer) - Aren't they sweet? (inspiring orchestral music) - Where is the seventh dwarf? (whimsical music) (uplifting orchestral music) (gasps)
