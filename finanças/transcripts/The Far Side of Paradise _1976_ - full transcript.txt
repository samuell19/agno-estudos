["Foxtrot" playing on gramophone] Again, sir? Oh, yes. [Eusebio] The same, sir? Oh, yes. [squeaking] ["Foxtrot" playing] Come back. [Captain] At 5 o'clock we'll be here. Then we'll sight your island at, uh, well, by midday tomorrow. If the weather holds. You've had a lucky voyage, Count. [Julia] There's nothing but ocean, and this one spot on it. The island is 800 miles from anywhere. You've never seen it? I saw it twice, uh, ten years ago. But, both times in the dark. The situation is right, Captain. It is far away. In these latitudes, you'll never see a winter. [sailor] That's too fine a coat to be wearing itself out in a box. It's a coat for a Sunday, to be sure. You look serious. Don't you want to come back? What I want won't pay my wages. What's so wrong with Romania? -It's pass√©. -Shit. I think you're all mad. He can afford it. It's up to him. Don't you know what happens to you on an island? [horn blaring] We've sighted your island, sir. Oh, let's go and see it. Don't you want it now that it's yours? Give me those. See if there are any palm trees. Thank you. [door opens, closes] [Julia] Larsen. I came on the day, Larsen. We are ready for you, Count. Take the luggage up to the site. Madam, we've started your garden. English roses. You won't see very much yet. But, I shall see them grow. It won't just be pruning. Were the plans useful? Almost perfect. But, I changed the orientation of the south portico. Too much wind. But, you'll approve. For plans drawn on the blind, they were quite accurate. The wells? Where you hoped they would be. But, I was wrong about the wind. It's a pity. [Julia] Liviu, stand a little closer to Larsen. Hold. Right. Do you like it, Julia? I love it. Well, all we have to do now is build. We'll unload the materials in the morning. I couldn't bear Europe another day, Larsen. [Julia] It would've taken at least three days to load everything. It's all crated and ready. The ship will go for it and return in six weeks. -The workmen? -They come with the materials, of course. I like it, Julia. We'll stay. [Larsen] What is happening in Europe? Madrid fell. [Larsen] Yes, I heard. I heard. [Julia] There isn't very much we left behind, is there, Liviu? For us, I mean. Europe died in '36. Neither aristocracy nor democracy mean anything anymore. They're both hounded equally. In Bucharest the Iron Guard are on every corner. [Larsen] The King? He no longer rules. Carol has no strength. [Julia] What are these marks, Larsen? [Larsen] The steps to the terrace. And how have you been feeling? Oh, I'm always ill. But I'm used to it. You were lucky o get away in time. This island is my only hope. If I stayed there I'd die. They'll be killing each other soon, you know. You're not the military type. In any case, your health would exempt you. My wound would reopen. Or a rat would infect me. [sighs] I'm tired. You mustn't try to do too much. They do too much and look at them, they're as healthy as beer. Eusebio, go and shave. Yes, of course, ma'am. I'm sorry. I've never seen him unshaven before. Strange wine, port. It comes for a place from Oporto. Then they add to it brandy, sugar, tannin, uh, until it becomes wine from nowhere. A killed wine. But, it's good. I'll change to port. Interesting. A corrupted wine. Captain Carnu, ready for the morning? Oh, yes. We go at six bells. Don't be concerned if we're not back on the dot. This time of year the Black Sea is unpredictable. I'm free of timetables, Captain. [Julia] We're slaves of the seasons. A month here, a fortnight there. I shall miss Venice, though. You're a fortunate man, Count. "All men said this was a fortunate man. But, see what showers now beat about his head. Call no man fortunate until he is dead." That's what they said of Oedipus, you know. What? That's what they said, "A very fortunate man." [orchestra music playing] [music stops] [classical music playing] Why is it, Larsen, that we sing our happiest songs in our worst times? Don't be too wise for your own good. What are you uneasy about? I have saved every last penny he's ever paid me. And, in a year or two, I'll have enough to say "toodle-oo". You know what I mean? I'm entitled to a bit of him, aren't I? You're entitled to your payday, Eusebio. He couldn't live without me. Or, without you. And what are you getting out of him? Just my price. [horn blaring] Don't you want to see them go? Why? You know, I doubt we could live without Frank Cooper's "Oxford" marmalade. You know what, Liviu? What, what? One day your ex-wife patted me on the cheek with her fan, and said that Frank Cooper's "Oxford" marmalade was your only woman. [laughing] [ship horn blaring] [barking] Oh, this must be the happy land if you're a seal. Absolutely no one to harm them. Damn, I'm getting blisters. I'm sure you haven't rowed since you left staff college. Larsen was an ogre, Julia. He'd assemble us at five in the morning. He made stable boys of noblemen. Didn't you, Larsen? That's why I had him come out here. Oh! This island is his revenge. But not against you, Larsen. [Liviu] Funny fellow, Major Larsen. He thought he was teaching me courage, when in fact I was learning cowardice. We taught them to disguise their terror. That's all that courage is. [Julia] If only it would rain. I'd like to feel some drops of rain. [Liviu] Are you going in? -[Larsen] Do you want to join me? -[Liviu] No, thank you. [Larsen gasps] Larsen? Liviu. Larsen! A cramp. Are you all right? [gasping] Liviu, he'll drown. We must save him. Don't move. Shut up! Liviu, for Christ's sake do something, he's drowning. Be careful. Careful of your wound. Here, let me do it. [Julia grunting] [Liviu grunting] [Julia] Liviu, give me your hand. Here. [Julia grunts] Come on. Liviu. Feeling any better? No. I don't know. Let me in. Poor wound. I just want to rest. Remember the madness? When we first met? The crowds, the noise, the music. Waiters shoving and shouting, and wheeling trays over our heads. And, you were so sweet, so frail, and so cold. I could only sing to your eyes, Liviu. Into you. The songs were so new, so silly. And I was so young. God, the pain of wanting you. I had to get you if only to stop wanting you. And, you came back. Again and again. And sat looking at me... for hours. Sometimes without saying a word. You were alive. And, I was not. I had to take you out of there. I was afraid of everything. Of you being in love and not with me, of myself loving and not loving you. Everything. [laughing] [Julia, Liviu and Larsen laughing] [laughing continues] Our movies, Eusebio. Yes, Count. I have them ready. [Liviu] Give me a cigar, would you? [Liviu] Ah, yes. Spandau, spring. [chuckles] Oh, God. Weren't we a spiry looking couple a mile down. There. Show your best side to the camera. [Julia] Ah, the wedding. Well, at least it doesn't hurt anymore. It doesn't? No, it doesn't. But then, the little singer marries the Count. Just four people were there. My family. Larsen, even you weren't there. I was in Spain, Julia. Heaven was falling. [laughs] Cozy and nice little style, hmm? Didn't know then this island was here. [church bells tolling] [Liviu] Stop it. Eusebio, stop it! You told me you'd destroyed that film. I swear to you, Julia, I burnt that film. You're a fool, Liviu. See, why I never believe him, Larsen? Even now he throws his mistress in my face. Brandy. Mariana? She was young then. I burnt that film in a hotel grate in Budapest two years ago. We all saw it, Liviu. It was there. Mariana de Guelfi of Liguria, deceased, has a way of wounding me at the most unexpected times. Whatever happened to her, Liviu, you were not responsible. [Liviu] Come on, come on in. -Come on. -[Julia] I don't want to. I'll look after you. I don't want to. I'll drown. Let's see who can stand the water longest. Please don't drown again. [Larsen] I don't have to worry. You are here. Give me some lemonade. Yes, ma'am. [Larsen laughing] [Larsen] Down we go. One, two, three! [Liviu] Ready when you are. [Julia] Are you thirsty? Yes. Come closer. Can you swim? More or less. Why don't you go in with them? It's not my place, ma'am. Sometimes I go in at night. Aren't you afraid? No. Well, yes. A little. I'm afraid of you. Me? Yes. Give me your hand. Take it off. Does it upset you to have your palm read? You've had a very unhappy life. But, I see a big change. You're gonna get married. You're gonna have two children and-- [Larsen and Liviu speaking indistinctly] More lemonade, madam? No. [panting] I won easily, Julia. He's not the man he was. We'll lunch down here, Eusebio. This omelette's too salty, Eusebio. Be more careful. Surely you know how, after all these years, I take my salt. What else have you? I have crepes Richelieu with pate de foie gras, sir. [Julia] It's funny. My omelet is perfect. Do you suppose Eusebio's trying to poison you, dear? Oh, yes, but why? [Liviu] Oh, don't just stand there. Come on. -Come on, Eusebio. -Larsen, Larsen! Oh, come on, Larsen. Oh, get on, get on. [squeaks gleefully] Damn. I told you, Larsen isn't fit. Eusebio must win three. Of course, and he will. It's your last chance, Larsen. If you don't win this time, I'll step on you. -And they're... -Threats. [Liviu] Off! Come on, boy. -Get... scram on boy. -[Julia] Down the tracks. -Oh, no, no. Come on, boy. -[Julia] Come on. Come on. Come on, Larsen. Quickly. Bit lazy, isn't he? -Come on, Larsen. -Tickle his back. "Tickle his back?" Come on! -[Julia] Here you go. Quickly. -Come on. -Come on. Oh, no. -[Julia] He's gonna do it. -Oh, no. -Go on, go on. [Julia] He's done it. Victory. Damn. I've won another favor. Mmm-hmm. I've had what... 22? Now I have 23. Yes, I think I might use one. Glass on the head. [clangs] Oh, no. I'll give you ten of my favors not to do glass on the head. No, but you can't lay off favors. It's not fair. Besides, you don't have ten. Well, I'm trading, you see, like stocks and shares, I'm trading. If you had a million, I'd still have my 23. This one. Come on. Glass on the head. Come on. Nice and easy. All right. -Now... -Oh, my God. Follow me around. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Careful. Oh, my God. -Keep looking. -Oh, dear. -Oh, dear. Oh, dear. -Okay. And... [gasps] [church bells tolling] [church bells continue tolling] What is it? What's happened, Liviu? We'll go back. No, I want to stay. We'll go back. I'm just beginning to enjoy myself. We'll go back. I know that look. You keep me as far away as if I was in Europe. Julia. -It's not you. -Well, what is it then? Oh, I know. I know what's troubling you. What's the date today? Sunday, I think. The date. Sunday, September the 28th. Why don't we just say it? Ship should have been back weeks ago. I'm sure the captain knows what he's doing. Liviu! Ten. Your ten, and up ten. I'll see you. My grandmother said, "Never disgrace an ace." [Eusebio] Dammit. If we had a radio... You know damn well why we don't have a radio. He didn't even allow me to bring a gun. It's dangerous to be out here out of reach. We could be talking to that bloody boat. Count Milescu has decided that he won't be followed. Everyone is followed. There is no one in the world who is not. But, he wasn't even questioned when his mistress died. How can he blame himself. He was Mariana's victim. Nobody blamed him. He will drag us all down with him. See what I mean? A yacht came in last night. A yacht? Ours? No. A black yacht. Liviu, I will not be humiliated by your former wife. Her life has changed. I'm sure she's changed. No, I don't like this suit. I want the tweed. Julia. Julia... please be kind to our guests. Yes, of course, darling. When did you invite our guests down? I didn't invite anyone. [horn blaring] [Paul] Julia, it's good to see you. -Liviu, my dear. -Hello, Paul. -Paul. -Hello, Liviu. We had to come to see you, my dear. You do drop in, don't you, my dear. You know Major Larsen. Oh, yes, yes. Major Larsen. [people laughing] Who are they? Friends. We were together on the Riviera when Hitler moved on Poland. -Poland? -When France came in, we got out. Then it's begun. You haven't heard, Liviu? War everywhere. The cities are burning. I know nothing of it. Don't you care, Liviu. Unshaven soldiers storming into your cellars, drinking up the wine. Well, we're here. It wasn't easy, but she's a beautiful boat. We brought the stores you asked for. We asked for? You were lucky. We got the message when we were nearing Panama, so, we stocked up, changed course, and here we are. Hollering and in heat. I brought you your towels, darling. [Liviu] What message? [Paul] Your radio message. There is no radio on this island. But then, your message came in clear. [Paul] How else could I know where to come, or... Okay, Liviu, what cigars did you ask for? [Julia] Upmann's, of course. Of course, Liviu's Upmann is the one predictable part of him. You have made Liviu mysterious. I never could. Frank Cooper's "Oxford" marmalade. Beside the Prune juice. Looks like we'll be staying here for the rest of our lives. We are staying here for the rest of our lives. [Liviu] See to our guests, Larsen. Make sure they have everything they wish. Shall do. [jazz music playing] [indistinct chatter] A Shirley Temple with a dash of Mummy's Ruin. I can tell, you're something. Where did they find you? I am Spanish, madam. And I am... generous. [jazz music playing] So? I've always chosen my men. Always? Yes. Is it true what I've heard about you? Oh, people do talk about me. And I'm sure they think they tell the truth. More or less. Have you known many men? Only one at a time. You can't have felt affection for all of them. Possibly not. I met a man once on a dance floor. He was loathsome. We stayed in his hotel room for three nights. It wasn't that bad. What was his name? I don't remember. I only loved one man. [jazz music playing] Hold me for a moment first. No, I want you now. [jazz music playing] Serve yourself a drink. [man] Your turn to smoke the happy weed. [indistinct chatter] [gunshots] [gunshots] [bird squawking] Don't you know what they're doing, Liviu? I hardly imagine your husband is deaf, dear. [Julia] They're killing everything. They've turned the island into a slaughter house. [Alexandra] Oh, do be reasonable. Why are these people here? Because of you, my dear. The trouble is, you haven't developed a taste for hunting. It's a marvelous sport. Instant satisfaction. [seals barking] [gunfire] They're killing the seals. There's nothing I can do about it, it's too late. It's done. Those birds, those seals, they've never heard a shot before. Killing them was easy. Hunting is our only way to be intimate with nature. You know yourself so well. [sombre music playing] So you won't leave with us? Liviu doesn't like our friends, Alexandra. Why are you always belittling us? If I were still with you, I wouldn't have these friends. I came because I loved you once. And, I loved you... once. You paid too little attention to me. Then afterwards, you paid too much. What did you expect? You should never have tried to find out. He's dead now, you know. I would like to stay. So much to stay. [ship horn blaring] We're ready to leave, sir. Thank you. Open it. [Paul] A miracle of care and technology. We have orders for millions of them now. You must be really grateful for 1939. You bet. It's a great year for gunsmiths. And what are you going to do with it? You've shot everything. [Paul] Well, we'll be on our way. Let's not say goodbye. We'll be back... for the roses. Still thinking of her? Of whom? How many times have you seen her since we were married? Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. They knew we were here. You left messages for her. I don't mind, Liviu, but I just need the truth. Larsen gave notice to the captain of the Galati. It was the Galati's signal they picked up. Oh, let me be. Let me be. Don't make me jealous. Please. Good brandy can dispel anything. I feel well. It's the light. This island has beautiful light. No, no. It's not the light. It's the brandy. Remember the sadness of those gray days I'm sorry, sir, this is the only box. Now, Liviu, we're where we wanted to be. Alone on an island. [Liviu] Oh, yes, but I wanted it suitable. A proper house with decent grounds. I wonder what happened, Larsen. What? To the building materials, to the ship. The ship is probably impounded somewhere, or, torpedoed. You know what that means, don't you? It means I can only smoke one cigar a day. -Ship's back. -The ship? The black yacht. What the hell for? Go tell the Count. And the Countess? No, uh, wait. Let them sleep. [bell dings] [bell continues to ding] There's no one here. The bread's fresh. [squeaking] Eusebio, get off this ship. What is it, Larsen? Into the boat, Eusebio. -Larsen. -Do as I say. Move! I told you, goddammit, untie the boat. [bell dings] [heavy breathing] I had no choice, Liviu. That was disease aboard. [Julia] Disease? I've seen it before, in the war, when we were driving on Karkov, the whole town empty, only rats. It had to be burnt out. There was no choice. -No choice. -No. [Julia] Where are they? The ship was empty. I said there was no one in it. Eusebio! We opened every door. What's this? Log book. It's torn. Last entry, mid-Atlantic, two months ago. I think we might have drinks when you're ready, Eusebio. I believe we can now consider ourselves to be castaway. [Eusebio] We don't have the island. Not anymore. Now, the island has us. I wish we had a dog. To begin at the beginning, I suggest we ration the food. -[Larsen] You agree? -Of course. To rationing everything. Of course. The fuel for the generator, we will maybe have two hours of electric light a night. And of course no more ice. But, we've always had ice. Thank you. I think, darling, that Eusebio would prefer to serve himself. Well... Chin Chin. Ring out the old, ring in the new. [clinking] We're ready. Not that one, it's my only green one. But, you said he could have one of your caps. -Yes, but not that. -To me. To me. -To me. -Eusebio. [Julia] Get, it. Larsen, quick. Me, me. -Larsen. -Come on, to me. Again. [Julia] To me. It's only a joke, Liviu. Take a joke. It was a game. Liviu, cut a strip from the big tent. The tent is our only privacy. It seems, darling, we are in a contradiction. We want modesty, they want exposure. We need some thing that they can see from a ship. How big? You decide, Count. Enough for a large flag. [jazz music playing] They say that Havana cigars are the finest because they roll them on womens thighs. Old wives' tale told by men. It must have something to do with the resilience. Oh, don't be upset. This one is for him. [Larsen] We have but little food left, you know. If the boat doesn't show up we'll end up being cannibals. Let's put on some music. [Eusebio] Maybe we can have a waltz. I've often wondered why you like Foxtrot so much. [waltz playing] Shall we dance? Don't be shy. Everything belongs to all now. Julia! The roses are coming out. Julia, on every side. Julia, look. What is it? What happened? Julia. Larsen. Larsen did it. It was Larsen. Go and get him. [Liviu] I'd like a word with you. [Larsen] Yes. You raped Julia. I what? I raped Ju... What are you talking about? She told me. She's insane. She showed me. I never touched her, ever. You danced with her. In front of you, Liviu. You did it to humiliate me. Oh, for Christ's sake. Humiliating you is not raping her. "Everything belongs to us all now." I heard you say it with your hands on her. But, not Julia. Except Julia. There are certain lies, Liviu, that you like to live up to. Mariana left you for dead before she killed herself. You live with a wound, Liviu. For Christ's sake, she stabbed you. And you made up that you killed her. Now you're inventing new lies. My wife doesn't lie. We'll see to that fa-- Face to face. If you go near her, I'll kill you. -You didn't do it, did you? -I couldn't. He'll kill us. You do understand. -I'm not a murderer, Julia. -No, not when it doesn't suit you. That's right. Well, if you don't care who mounts your wife. Eusebio, please help me. I... [sobs] Larsen! You got it coming to you, come out! Larsen! Here I am, Eusebio. You forced her. Don't move, and I won't hurt you. It's him, Eusebio. He has the rifle, he'll kill us both. Because we're not his servants anymore. He thought he owned our lives. Did you rape her? Can't you see what they're at? They're together, Eusebio. It's them, it's her. And, you are their servant still. No. There's no lord or lady. We all agreed we share. Why are you here with a knife then? The only thing you'll get from them is orders, Eusebio. They can't share. But, they said we would. We would be equal. With Count Liviu Milescu? Mmm-mmm. Come on. You and I will share, Eusebio. But he, he has the gun. He never sleeps. But, he can't look two ways at once. So, we'll go for him, two ways at once. What about Julia? She'll have no choice. Why don't we hide, and wait? He's sick. You know how sick he is. Liviu's sickness is just another of his luxuries. I don't know how to kill him. Tell me straight, Eusebio. You do want her, don't you? Yes. I understand. [buzzing] I missed them. They ran away. What do you suppose they will do? Kill us, or, try to. What a way for it to all end. We should have brought women for them. Yes. Oh, yes. We should have. Forgive me. They terrify me. Tomorrow I'll hunt them. I'll get them both. Eusebio, he'll hear your teeth. [church bell tolls] Julia! Julia! Julia, Julia! Julia! I told you to stay here. I forbade you to go outside. We don't know where they are. They'll watch for you to go out, and they'll come in and get me. But did you see them. No, of course not. Liviu, calm down. [heavy breathing] They've cut off the water. What is there left for us to do? Oh, God. What can we do? Julia. What? You can go to them. Is that what you want? [twig snaps] [rustling] [Julia screams] It's all right. Come on. You're lovely. He's unpredictable at night. Please control yourself, Eusebio. He's out there somewhere. He's much more afraid of us than we are of him. I told you. Yes, but it's fear I'm scared of. So, we agree. He's like a trapped animal. So, we better get at him quickly. Lift your end. You and your stupid barricades. We should be moving around. Don't talk to me like that. You brought him on us. You couldn't keep your hands off his wife. You're a child, Eusebio. Am I? Well, that's funny. Like you had all the juice. You are the man. Larsen, with the reach. You had her. Come on, help me with these thorns. Was she good? Did she get wet? Did she enjoy it? It's you he wants to kill. And you know what'll happen, Larsen? I'll go back to being his servant again. [grunting] [screams] [groaning] [groans] Why? [Larsen] Liviu! Julia's dead, Liviu! Julia's dead, Liviu! Eusebio's drowned her. I was too late. So, where's your rifle? She's dead. I was too late. He's in the tent. [gun cocks] Eusebio! Eusebio! And I slept. She called for you, Liviu. I could hear her calling for you. But, I was too far away. And then... nothing. But I saw Eusebio. Where is she? By the logs at the beach. I'm so sorry. Odd that I should sleep. I sleep so little. How could you know? You saw Eusebio? Yes. And you woke me? But, I swear to you. I didn't do it. He was dead already. But... Look, Liviu. We get out of this together. You need me. We need each other. You can't really mean that, can you? But, I do. Oh. It doesn't matter.
