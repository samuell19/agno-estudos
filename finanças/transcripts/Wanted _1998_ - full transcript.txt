(melodic cinematic music) (light melodic orchestral music) (mellow upbeat music) (breathing heavily) (mellow upbeat music) (breathing heavily) (mellow upbeat music) (breathing heavily) (mellow upbeat music) (traffic rumbling quietly) - Money's due tomorrow, Scrico. You're gonna have to squeeze him hard. - Come on, Nick, Maxie's a friend. - Screw your friends, do your freaking job! 'Cause if you don't, Vinny will. You let him slide too long, Scrico. Don't screw it up! (mellow melodic music) - Come on, Jimmy, you've known me for years, I'm doing everything I can. - It ain't my call, Maxie, you're four payments behind, 10 freaking Gs. - Can't you talk to them? - No, you signed the note, it's all talked out. - I'm busted, man, I'm in hock up to my ass! - Damn it, Maxie, think about who we're dealing with, Vinny comes knocking, gonna be more busted than just your goddamn ass, Maxie, think about it. - Oh. It's okay, honey. (melodic haunting music) - Look, maybe I'll try talking to Vinny's father, you know, see if he can get you out of this mess. - You're a good boy, Jimmy. - Let's hope he thinks so. (melodic haunting music) Ah, Mr. Argento. - Not now, Jimmy. - Please, sir, I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't important. - What's the matter with you, kid? Are you deaf or just dumb? (melodic haunting music) (car engine starting) (mellow upbeat music) (melodic haunting music) - [Agent Baker] Mr. Argento. You're on time, I like that. - I trust your flight was uneventful? - I thought we agreed this was to be a private transaction. - He goes where I go. - Then perhaps I should find someone else with whom I can do business. - So let's talk. It's okay, Ed, you stay here, I'll call you if I need you. Alright, you said you wanted to do some talking, let me say this first. I think this whole deal should be sweetened a little. - Sweetened? - Yeah, that's right. - Sweetened? - That's right. - I'm afraid I don't agree, you've already been offered very generous terms. - Alright, son, there is no more talking, okay, no choices, no option, the deal's over, okay. - Sorry, Argento, you're the one with no choice. - [Vincent] What the hell are you doing? - [Agent Baker] You should have taken the deal, Argento. - You goddamn fool, Eddie! - Mr. Argento! - Lose the gun, asshole. - Trust me, mister, you don't wanna do this. - Do what he says, Eddie, do it. - The vat, in the vat! - Do it! Do it, Eddie! (light haunting music) Do it, Eddie. Come on, you know I'm not packing and you don't get away with this. - Really? I'll be long gone before anyone even notices you're missing. Uh! - Come on, this way! (groaning with effort) - Don't be stupid now. Give me back the gun! Damn it! - You wait here, I'm gonna check the door. (melodic haunting music) (rattling door) It's locked. (gun firing) - Uh! (groaning) - Oh, God. (tires screeching) (motorbike engine starting) - He followed us to an old abandoned warehouse, Vinny, I swear to God, I saw him, I saw the kid. He put a bullet right through your father's heart. - Jimmy? Where was my father? You were supposed to be protecting my father. - He wouldn't let me go with him, Vinny. (thudding blow) Uh! - Why would Scrico whack my father? - [Ed] I don't know. - Who the hell was this other guy? - I never saw the guy before in my life, Vinny. Your dad mentioned something about him flying in from somewhere, but he never mentioned where. It wasn't my fault, Vinny! - Shut up! Give me a drink. Find that son of a bitch, Scrico, you bring him back to me. (melodic haunting music) Ed, not you. (mellow upbeat music) (gentle snoring) (TV broadcasting quietly) - Oh, I didn't think you'd be home tonight. - I've gotta leave town, Ma, I gotta get out of here fast. - Are you in some kind of trouble? (dog barking in distance) - Some kind of trouble, Ma, that don't begin to describe it. (car door closing) - [Mrs. Scrico] Does it have anything to do with those apes downstairs? - [Jimmy] I've gotta get out of here, Ma. - Jimmy, Jimmy, here, you take that, you need that more than me. (dog barking in distance) Now go. (knocking on door) You don't have to break the goddamn door down! - Where is he? - Who? - Don't play stupid. (melodic suspenseful music) Joey, Joey! He's running down the alley, get the car! (melodic suspenseful music) (dog barking in distance) - [Guy] Hey, honey, I sure could use another beer! - Get it yourself. (melodic haunting music) (breathing heavily) (phone ringing) - Who's this? - Who do you think it is, you dumb schmuck? - Nick, it was an accident, I was trying to save him, you got to believe me. - Hey, you don't have to convince me. Why don't you be a good boy and tell us where we can pick you up? This way you can convince Vinny too. Well, Jimmy, what do you say? - Go to hell. (cell phone clattering to floor) (mellow melodic music) - Hey, Jimmy. What's going on, man? What you doing? Long time, no see, - I need your car, Gilbert. - Yeah, me too. - I'll buy it from you. - It ain't for sale, man. - I'll give you $100 for it. - 250. - 150, - 200. - I don't have 200, Gilbert. - Then take a fucking cab, Jimbo. - Listen to me, Gilbert. You need smack, I need wheels, I'll give you 150 for it, cash. - Yeah, alright. - Hey, keys. - They're in the car. (car engine starting) (mellow upbeat music) - [Radio Weatherman] Eight miles per hour, the temperature dropping. (light melodic orchestral music) - Are you gonna come with me or what? - Can we talk about it later? - Can we talk about it now? (sighing heavily) How come you never wanna go anywhere with me? - [Rosa] It's your scene, Jimmy, not mine. It's your scene, Jimmy, not mine. It's your scene, Jimmy, not mine. - I'm sorry, Ro, it ain't gonna always be like this. - [Rosa] It just isn't gonna happen, I have a career, my life is here, not in some far away fishing village up the coast. (birds twittering) - [Andy] 14's your change. - Thanks. (store door bell ringing) (brakes screeching) (police radio broadcasting quietly) (car ignition stuttering) - You know, Andy, this coffee really sucks. - [Andy] Thanks, I made it myself. (melodic haunting music) - [Jimmy] Shit. - Hey, you need a jump? (car engine starting) - No, thanks, it's just a little cold this time of day, that's all. (mellow melodic music) (mellow melodic music) (birds twittering) (melodic haunting music) - Hey! - What the, ah! - [Jimmy] Get the hell out of there! (thudding) - Ow! - Hey! - Oh, fuck! - Get the hell out of there. - Ow! Argh! Goddammit, Flip you were supposed to be on lookout! - I'm sorry, I didn't hear him coming. - Lookout means with your eyes, you dumbass! - Shut up! - Ah, hey, get your hands off the me, mister, I'll have your ass busted for statutory assault! - Yeah? - Yeah! - There's no such thing. - You wanna see if I'm bluffing? - You wanna explain to the police what you were doing hot-wiring my car? - I'm a kid, what the fuck would I know about hot-wiring a car? - Oh, come on, Tony, let's get outta here, okay. - Get your hands off me. (melodic haunting music) (birds twittering) - [Flip] Ow, God, ow! Ow, ow, ow! (melodic haunting music) Ow, ow, ow! Ow! Ow, God, it hurts! Oh, God, ow, ow! - What's the matter? - Flip stepped on a rattlesnake, it bit the crap out of him. - I'm scared, Tony, I don't wanna die, please. - Do something, come on, suck the poison out. - This kid, you've seen one too many cowboy movies. Alright, hold that. We've got to get you to a doctor. Where's the nearest hospital? - How should I know? We're not from around here. - Ow! - Well, where the hell are you from? This kid needs help. - A school, it's about a mile or so up the road. There's a nurse there. - [Jimmy] Well, show me. (mellow melodic music) Get the door for me. (car engine starting) (car horn tooting repeatedly) (mellow melodic music) - [Sue] What happened? - [Jimmy] A rattler bit him on the ankle. - [Sue] Alright, follow me. - The nurse gave the boy a shot to counteract the poison. - He's gonna be okay? - He's gonna be fine thanks to you, Mr.? - Oh, Scott, James Scott. Jesus Christ, when I saw that kid was bit, I nearly shit a brick. - I'm Father Donnelly. - Are you a priest? (children playing outside) Sorry. (door opening) - Nothing to apologize for, you saved the boy's life. - You certainly did. - [Chris] Sue, Sue Bradley, James Scott. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Can we get you a cup of coffee or something to eat? - Yeah, that's great, thanks, boss. - Sue, can you take him by the cafeteria? I've got to go see Father Patrick. - Sure, bye. (light melodic music) Enjoying your-- - So? You were gonna ask me something? - No, you go ahead. - So what is St. John's, is this some sort of reform school? - Not really, boys are sent here, so they don't end up in reform school. - Hm. Well then, how come there's hardly anybody here? - Spring Break. - Oh, right, right, Spring Break. - Some kids just don't have any other place to go. - Well, it's nice and peaceful, huh? (birds twittering) - Hey man, what the hell are you doing here? - I thought you'd like some company, - I thought they locked you up. - They did, but what they don't know won't frigging hurt me. You know, I'm still gonna get us out of here, you'll see. - Like this morning? - Hey, it's not my fault you stepped on that goddamn snake. - Oh, come on, man, just not so freaking loud. - Don't wimp out me, Flip, not now, not if you want this hole to be history. - Yeah, well, in the meantime, better get your sorry butt back to detention. - Hey chill, easy come, easy go. (light melodic orchestral music) (church bells ringing) - There he is. Father Donnelly, Jimmy's gonna be taking off soon. - Ah, thanks again for bringing the boys back, Jim, I hope it wasn't too much out of your way. - Something wrong? - Oh, the painter quit, apparently he got a better job offer elsewhere. - You need a good brush man? - Got somebody you wanna recommend? - You're looking at him. I mean, I spent many a summer house painting with my own man, before he retired. - It's only about a week's work. - Be glad to help out. - I'll introduce you to Father Patrick. (melodic haunting music) The roast beef was a little tough today, wasn't it? - [Sue] Yeah, you know, we saved some pie for you. (laughing) - Let's see, you offered this drifter a job without consulting with me first? - I'm certain he'll do fine. - You are? Well, that's good, because I thought it was just yesterday, that you stood right there in front of me and you were certain, that we should leave boys like Flip and Tony to, how did you phrase it? To be responsible for their own actions? - Thomas, please, let's not confuse the issues. - All your books and your diplomas haven't taught you a blessed thing. Chris, what these boys need is discipline. - What we need, what we need is to have all the work around here finished and I found a young man who's willing to help out. Who is it that said most recently in their sermon, that acceptance is the most generous deed of all? - That is a low blow and unworthy of you. Show him in. (door opening) - Father Thomas Patrick, James Scott. - Pleasure to meet you, sir. (birds twittering) - Are you Catholic? - Absolutely, Father Patrick, born and bred. - Well, I guess the bottom line then. - James. - James, is I, we expect the work to be done in a professional manner with a certain decorum in front of the boys. In exchange for that, you will receive lodging and food and minimum wage. Any questions? - When do I get started? - Well, we rise with the sun. - Come on, I'll show you to your room. (melodic haunting music) Chuck, there's someone I want you to meet, Chuck White, James Scott. - How you doing? - Moving in? - For a while. - Yeah, I seen you talking to Sue. - Nice lady. - Yeah, she is, that's why I'm gonna marry her. Have a good evening, Father. - See you tomorrow, Chuck. - Toilets and showers are down the hall, there's a payphone on every floor. - Great. (church bells ringing) - Welcome aboard, Jim. - Thanks. (melodic haunting music) (sighing) - Yeah, Operator, a collect from Jimmy. Ma, it's me, accept the charges. Thanks, Operator. I just wanted to let you know, I'm okay, Ma. I can't tell you where I am, I'm someplace safe. Yeah, I'll be about a week, (sighing) you know, just long enough to make some money and then I'll be moving on. I know. Of course I'm gonna call again, I'll call again as soon as I hit the road. I love you, Ma. (melodic haunting music) (traffic rumbling quietly) - You want me to give you 48 hours, Maxie? - I'll do anything you say, Vinny. - Good, help me find Jimmy. - How am I supposed to know where he is? - Oh, come on, he's a friend of yours, you gotta know something. (gun cocking) - Okay, okay, look, I know he's got a new girlfriend. - See, beautiful, tell us about her. I bet they make a lovely couple. (melodic haunting music) - [Ed] Mr. Argento! (gun firing) (gun firing) - Uh! (school bell ringing) (groaning) (birds twittering) (groaning) (church bells ringing) (children playing in distance) - Hey, look who's slapping paint. Priests con you into working for them? - Something like that, when did you get out? - Warden's got me on probation, I swore I'd behave. - And you never lie, Tony, do you? - Probably about as much as you do. - So what happens if you break probation? - Get sent to Juvenile Hall, no biggie. So are you any better with the basketball, than you are with a paintbrush? - You are really lucky that I'm painting, 'cause I take off from the free throw line, you know what I mean? - Yeah, whatever, just give me back my ball, you might get paint on it. (melodic suspenseful music) - Ah, ah, no! Oh, oh! What do you want from me? - An answer to a very simple question, where's Jimmy. - How the hell should I know? - I'm not a very patient man, Rosa. - Last I saw him was a couple of nights ago, I haven't heard from him since. - Alright, I'll be more specific. If he was hiding, where would he go? - Hide, hiding? - Do yourself a favor, ma'am, answer the question. - I don't know where he'd go, - Nicky. (gun cocking) - There was some place that he talked about it, it was up the coast or some, I don't know. - Where exactly? - I don't know. - Concentrate. - It was like some sort of pipe dream. - Pipe dream? - The place never sounded real to me. - A dream? - [Rosa] I didn't take him seriously. - Well, perhaps you should've, Nicky. - Please believe me, I don't know. - Nicky. - I don't know! - Nicky. - I don't know! (gun clicking) I don't know, I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! - Okay, shh, shh! I believe you. You can go. (melodic haunting music) Oh, Rosa, wait a minute. (gasping in fear) We'll be in touch. - Ah! (sobbing) (birds twittering) (children playing outside) - So I'll probably keep him for a few hours and release him at the end of the day. Oh! - You okay? - Yeah, I just got something in my eye. - [Jimmy] Let me see. (melodic haunting music) Better? - Yes. Thanks. - Sure. - Bye. - Bye. - [Chuck] Sue. You and I need to talk. - What is it, Chuck? - I think you know what. I saw the way he was touching you. - Who, Jimmy? - Goddammit, Sue, I don't like what's going on between you two. - Alright, Chuck, you're right, we do need to talk. - So you don't deny it, do you? - It's not about Jimmy, it's about us. I've been doing a lot of thinking. - So what are you trying to tell me? (light melancholic music) - Chuck, I've changed. I want different things in life and I can't keep pretending that we're right for each other. I'm sorry. I hope some day you'll understand. - Sue. (church bells ringing) (melodic haunting music) Want some advice, asshole? (children playing in distance) - Not really. - Forget about the goddamn job, pack your bags and move on. - I've got some advice for you too, Chuck, get a fucking life. - Huh, oh, I got one and it don't include you. (light melodic orchestral music) (phone ringing) - [Sue] I can't answer the phone right now. You know what to do. (electronic beeping) - [Chuck] Come on, honey, I know you're there, pick up. Sue, pick up the phone. I'm sorry, come on, I love you and I know you love me. I can't lose you, you're everything to me. Call me. (electronic beeping) - Well, I think he's cool. (sighing) - He's hiding something, Flip. You saw the way he hot-wired that car, he was like a pro. - Wait, I think someone's coming. - [Jimmy] What's up? - Hi Jimmy. - Hey. - Want a smoke? - I got some of my own, thanks. So it's good to have you back on your feet, huh? - Yeah, well, it's nice to be back on them. (cicadas chirping) - I thought I heard voices. - Father Donnelly. - Hi, Jim, I didn't know it was you.. - Oh yeah, I was just getting some fresh air. - What's happening? - Just getting some fresh air. - Well get this, it's past curfew. - Oh, it was my fault, Father, I was talking to them. - We'll go back to our rooms now. - Cool. Take it easy. - Yeah. - Take it easy? What a dweeb. - Sorry. - Oh, comes with the turf, I guess. - Yeah. - I was wondering, can I buy you a beer? - Yeah. - See, Tony, I told you Jimmy was alright. - Alright, nothing, afraid to cross me is more like it. The guy knows I'm pegging his ass. - For what? - I don't know yet, but you can bet your butt, when I find out, it'll be our ticket out of this dump. (church bells ringing) (sighing) - I've spent years studying psychology and education, I've been quoted in texts and published in journals, yet no matter how hard I try to get down to those boys' level, they mock me. - Maybe that's why? - What do you mean? - What do I know? - Come on, give me some advice, what do you mean? - Well, these boys, Father, they aren't stupid. - Never said they were stupid. - Well, then instead of trying to get down to their level, I don't know, why not just be yourself and let them rise up to yours? - Cheers. (bottles clinking) (birds twittering) (children playing outside) - Father Patrick. Morning, Sue. - Morning. - James, is there a problem? - Oh, I'm just running a little low on paint, sir. - We have an account at the hardware store in town, I'll call ahead and let them know you're coming. - Oh, you know, do they deliver? 'Cause my car has got a busted ignition. - Sue, you're driving into town? - Yeah, the post office. - Would you be so kind as to give James a lift? - Sure, come on. (melodic haunting music) (car engine starting) - It's not that he's a bad guy, it's just, it's just that we're not right for each other. God knows, now I won't be able to avoid running into him or all his friends. That's the problem with small towns, everyone's always crossing paths with everyone else. - Yeah, well, the city's no better, Sue, there's just a lot more crap to step in. - Don't I know it? Been there, done that. (melodic haunting music) (mellow melodic music) We're here. (light melodic music) So what's your story, Jimmy? (quiet background chattering) - No story. - Come on, everybody has a story. - Maybe. Someday when things are a little bit different, I'll tell you. - Hardware store's over there, I'll run to the post office, I'll meet you. (mellow melodic music) (background chattering) (store door bell ringing) - Three gallons of paint, one standard ignition, anything else? - That's all, just charge to the St. John account please. - No problem, Father Patrick called me, I just need to see your ID. - Hm? - Driver's license will do. - Ah, damn. You know, I think it's with my stuff back at the school. Yeah. - I'll vouch for him, Sam. (melodic haunting music) - Howdy-do, Chuck, well, that's good enough for me. - Thanks. - No sweat. Do a favor for me. - I'll try. (birds twittering) - By the time I arrive at St. John's tomorrow, be gone. - And if I'm not, Chuck? - Then you'll be carried out on a goddamn stretcher. - You really think you can handle me? - I really think you're about to find out. - Afternoon, fellas, something going on? Who's your friend, Chuck? - My friend is a passerby the priests hired to do their painting, who don't see fit to carry no ID. - It's not a good practice, boy. - Yeah, well, sir, it won't happen again. - I'm sure. Well take care, son, I'll see you later. - You bet, Dad. Keep in mind what I said. - So, what did Chuck and his dad have to say? - Not much, just welcoming me to the community. (car engine starting) - Come on, Dad, we need to check him out. - Take it easy, son, I need that schedule, Peg. What makes you so sure that this boy has got something to hide, hm? - You saw the look on his face, that's why he don't carry no ID. - Yeah, maybe, this needs four to 12, next week. Now look, is this about that girlfriend of yours? It is, isn't it, it's about Sue? - Dad, it's-- - Don't Dad me. Every time you get off on one of these tangents of yours, it's not bad enough you cause trouble for yourself, but you embarrass the hell out of me. Now you control it, son. If he breaks the law, I'll bring him in. Don't go causing any problems for yourself or me. (birds twittering) - [Flip] Almost done? - Just about. - Hey, Flip, isn't it time? - Yeah, I know, time to go back to my room. - Hey, come here. We need to have a little talk. What's with the attitude? Something you picked up from Tony? You look up to him, don't you? You don't have to answer that, but think about this, be careful who you wanna be like, who you wanna follow, some kids are gonna lead you in the wrong direction, but you know what I think? If you follow what's in your heart, more often than not, you're gonna find yourself doing the right thing. - Thanks, Father. (light melodic music) (mellow upbeat music) - Where is it? - Where's what? - Don't push me. - What are you gonna do, kick my ass? I'm just a kid. - Okay, smart ass, how's this for a scam? If you don't return it in five minutes, I'll bring Donnelly here myself and you can tell them how you broke in my room and stole it. - You're bluffing. - Am I? (melodic haunting music) (sighing) - Hey, what's up, Tony? - Tonight's the night. Oh, come on, Flip, don't be a wimp now. - Sorry, Tony, I can't go. - Why not? - I've got nowhere to run away to, Tony. Just be careful. (door closing) (mellow melodic music) (car engine starting) (tires screeching) - [Jimmy] Hey! (mellow upbeat music) - [Chris] What's going on? - Tony, he's stealing my car! - Here, in here. (car engine starting) (tires screeching) (mellow upbeat music) He couldn't be too far ahead of us, he didn't get that much of a headstart. - [Jimmy] Look! - [Chris] Good Lord! - Tony! Tony! Are you alright? - No, I'm screwed. (melodic haunting music) - Is he hurt? - No, he's in the infirmary with Sue. - [Jimmy] So what's gonna happen to Tony now? - He'll be put in detention, until we can move him to Juvenile Hall. - He'll live. - I wish I could say the same for my car. - Then shall we call the Sheriff now, James? - No, the kid's got enough problems, Father. - Yes, that's quite true. (light melodic music) - So you wanna get a cup of coffee or a glass of wine? - Is there any place open? - Yeah, I know a place. (mellow melodic music) - [Nick] So Vin, what's our next move? - We wait, till he calls home. (melodic haunting music) - After finishing nursing school, I just felt lost, alone in the city. It seems like everyone you meet there is looking for an angle, doing some sort of hustle. I just missed the clean air and the mountains and down to earth people. So when Father Donnelly offered me a position here, I was only too eager to come back to Pine Creek. - [Jimmy] And to Chuck? (light melodic orchestral music) - And to Chuck. I guess in the years that I was away, we just grew apart. - You outgrew him. - Yeah, I outgrew him. But still there's a void. - What would fill it? - Finding someone, I guess, someone who really wants to be a part of my life and who'd really let me be a part of theirs. So what about you, Jimmy? Where are you coming from? I know, I know, someday. Can you at least tell me where you're going? - How about where I'd like to go? - It's a start. - I would like to go to a small coastal town, you know, someplace where I can just start over, where I could have a fishing boat, kind of big enough to charter and spend my days pounding waves with the salty wind hitting my face. Yeah, well, that sounds crazy, doesn't it? - It sounds beautiful. So how would you like to spend your nights? (light melodic orchestral music) (cicadas chirping) There you are. Can't sleep? Why don't you tell me what's bothering you. - No, it's okay, it's okay. (birds twittering) - Ready? I like you, I do. - I like you. - But I can't. I won't get involved with somebody who isn't open with me. If not me, then please, Jimmy, talk to someone else, because that darkness I see inside of you will never go away and it has to, if you want your dream to come true. - We should go. (light melodic music) (mellow melodic music) (church bells ringing) (melodic haunting music) (light melodic music) (sighing) Forgive me, Father for I have sinned. It's been, years since my last confession. - It's okay, Jim, I'm listening. (light melodic music) - My real name is not Scott, it's James, James Scrico. - Why the different name? - I killed a man. - Tell me what happened. - I didn't mean to do it, Father. I wrestled the gun from the man, I tried to stop a killing, not commit one. I was cornered and scared, I turned and the gun went off, the gun just went off, the gun just went off. - It was an accident? - I don't know, it all happened so fast. (sighing) - Why haven't you gone to the police? - Oh, I'd be dead, I'd be dead before I reached the holding cell. - Who'd you kill? - Vincent Argento. - You can't hide forever, Jim, at least not from your conscience. But whatever you decide, I'll be here for you, if you need me. - I guess the moral of the story is how can you pursue a dream, when your life has turned into one big nightmare? (sighing) - What about your family? (children playing outside) - Oh, it's just my Mom. (sighing) - [Sue] Go ahead, use it. (melodic haunting music) (sighing) (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Jimmy] Ma, it's me. - It's been days since you called, I thought something else had happened. - I'm sorry, Ma, I'm alright. There's just something important you need to know, that I made a decision. - What kind of decision? - I'll be leaving here soon. I'm gonna turn myself in. - [Mrs. Scrico] It's for the best. - [Jimmy] I really didn't mean to do it, it was an accident. - [Mrs. Scrico] I believe you, honey. - [Jimmy] I know that you believe me, Ma and I love you for that. I'll miss you, I'll call you as soon as I can, alright. I love you. - I love you too, son. - I'll call when I can. (melodic haunting music) (traffic rumbling quietly) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Hey, Nick, yeah, it's me. Tell Vinny to forget about the coast, tell him I think I just earned my Christmas bonus. - Yeah, I'll let him know and rest assured your stocking will be full. - Yeah. - I wanna contact authorities, let them know where to pick me up. - I'll make the call. (birds twittering) - Have faith, my son. - I'm trying to, Father, but it'd be a lot easier if it came with a bulletproof vest. (mellow upbeat music) - I understand, Father. No, no, no, no, have Scrico stay where he is. Tell him I'll be leaving ASAP. Right. Thank you, Father Donnelly. Bye bye. - Yeah, right, Bob, 118 Junction, that won't take an hour. I'll see you. - Dad, I really think we need to run a computer check on this guy. - Not now, Chuck, I promised the Sheriff over Weston I'd help him work a hit and run. - When are you gonna be back? - Well, it depends now, doesn't it? Peggy had to run out, so do me a favor, answer the phone till she gets back, would you please? - You've got it. Let's see. (melodic haunting music) - Yeah, this is Ross. Put me through to the police department in a place called Pine Creek. (phone ringing) - Pine Creek PD. No, the Sheriff ain't in, who's calling please? Sergeant Ross. Well, this is Deputy White, sir, can I be of service? Yes, sir. Sure, I know St. John's School For Boys. Of course, I'll be waiting here to accompany you. Speaking of the goddamned devil. (birds twittering) - Next time you hire a drifter, Chris, consult with me. - Here I thought we'd get through this without you telling me, I told you so. Sometimes bad things happen to good people, Thomas, my instincts still tell me that he's a good man. - Ah, yes, your instincts. (light melancholic music) (traffic rumbling quietly) - Ah-huh. Yes. Very good, I'll let him know. They found Scrico. - Alive? - Yeah, Ross is on his way to pick him up. We'll keep him in protective custody till after you testify tomorrow. - Let's just hope Ross gets to him first. (melodic haunting music) - If only that dumb kid hadn't interfered. - You know, it's funny how you start to look at this stuff at a time like this. I mean, when you're younger, you don't think about the consequences of your actions and then when you're older, well, by then sometimes it's too late. - You've become quite a philosopher, Jim. - When I look at the boys here and I think about Tony, - Hm-mm. - and I wonder if he knows, that he still has a chance of getting things right. - Why don't you tell him? (light melodic music) You've got a visitor. I'll wait outside. - So how's it going, Tony? - Like you give a damn. - I give a damn. - Why is that? Because I know what you're hiding? (children playing outside) - It's all out in the open now, I'm not hiding a thing. The question is what are you hiding? - Nothing. - [Jimmy] Hm. - What's going on in there? - Jim's with him. - What? - Thomas, let them be. - Mind if I have a seat? - It's a free country. - No, it ain't. Everything's got a price, whatever you the hell you do, one way or another you pay for. - For once, I see your goddamn point. - You know what I see? - What's that? - Someone not so different than me. - Yeah? - Yeah. A punk so scared, he's about to pee his pants. - I ain't scared! - Well, then you're stupid. - Take that back! - Or worse, a goddamn loser. - Shut the hell up! You're the goddamn loser! - Like I said, Tony, you ain't so different than me. - That's a frigging crock. - Who's your father, Tony? - What the hell does that have to do with anything? - I don't know mine either, where's your mother? - Shut the hell up! - Is she stoned, shacking up? - Shut up! - Where's your family, Tony, who cares about you, who gives you love, huh? - Stop it, stop it! - Huh! - Shut up! - Think you can find family in a prison yard? - Stop! - Love getting diddled by some gang banger? - Stop! - Huh? - That's enough. - Stop it, shut up! Stop it, stop! Stop. - There is your family, Tony. - Please, don't send me away. I'll be good, I promise. - Everything's gonna be alright, Tony. Nobody's gonna send you anywhere. Now are you ready to go back to your own room? - Thank you. - Thank you. (crow cawing) (mellow upbeat music) - I'm sorry that I can't stay, Jimmy, I've got to teach this class in Weston. - Don't worry, Father, I'll be okay. - I'm sure you will. You know where to reach me. (Sue sighing) - [Jimmy] Must be time for you to be heading home. - I'd rather be with you. (light melodic music) (mellow upbeat music) - [Vinny] Beautiful, it looks like a farmhouse, right? (melodic haunting music) - [Cook] Fish is back here. - How you doing? - Yeah? - Maybe you could help us out, we're looking for directions - There you go, Chuck. - to the St. John's School For Boys. - I can help you there. You fellas are early, that's why I wasn't waiting at the station. You're looking for that guy, Scrico, right? - Maybe. - Oh, I got it, plain clothes and all, you can't be too careful. I spoke to you on the phone, I told you I was Chuck White, Deputy White. Sergeant Ross. - Oh yeah, yeah, I remember you. - Oh, yeah, Deputy White. - I can take you straight to him. - Scrico? - You can't be too careful. - No, you can't. Deputy White, let me introduce you to my associates, Officer Pina. - Pleasure's all mine. - And Officer Francelli over here. - How are you? - Welcome to Pine Creek. - Thank you. - The Deputy's gonna bring us to see Jimmy Scrico. - Beautiful. - [Cook] Order up! - After you. - Got it. (mellow upbeat music) - This is government issue? - Bought and maintained with tax payers' dollars. (car engine starting) - Once the jury hears your story, they're bound to acquit you. - If I get that far. - Stop thinking like that. - I can't help it, Sue, I just can't shake this feeling of doom. - Try and picture that coastal town and that charter boat instead. - It ain't gonna happen. - It will, if you believe in it. (mellow upbeat music) - Coming up is Lookout Road, you'll hang a left and you'll find the school right around the bend. - Deputy White, are there gonna be a lot of people up here at the school? - At the moment just a few priests and a handful of kids. - Yeah, that concerns me. If Scrico sees us coming, he could panic, put up a fight, we wouldn't want anyone to get hurt, you know, especially the kids. - There's a back way in, you could take him by surprise. - Excellent, good work. (mellow melodic music) - We should probably wait for him at the office. There's no need for the boys to see you taken in. - Sue. - I know. I know, me too. (light melodic orchestral music) - I gotta go back to the room, I'll get my bag and then they should be here soon. - Try right now. - Chuck? - Hello, Jimmy. - Hey, there's Jimmy, let's go. - Who are these guys? - They're police officers, Sue. - That's right, ma'am, we're here to take Jimmy in peacefully. - Why the back way, why didn't you check in up front? - They were afraid that I'd come out shooting. - [Flip] Hey, Jimmy. - Don't take any chances, that innocent people could get hurt. - Almost thought you were gonna leave without saying goodbye. - Oh no, Tony, I was on my way over to see you guys, it's just that the police, they got here a little early. (melodic haunting music) So this, this is goodbye. Sue, can you please take them back to the house? - That's a good idea. Why don't you go on with them, Chuck? We'll take over from here. - Yes, sir. - Nice work. - [Sue] Come on, boys, let's go. - Frisk the son of a bitch. - Alright, tough guy. - Alright, he's clean. - Good. Let's take a little stroll, Jimmy. My car's right over here. - Uh! (mellow upbeat music) - Shit! (gun firing) - Where's your father? - He's in Weston. - Can you reach him? - Yeah. - Get him! (gun firing) - Yeah, this is Chuck, I'm trying to reach my dad. (melodic haunting music) - Stay here. (mellow upbeat music) (melodic haunting music) I'll cover you. (melodic haunting music) - [Nick] Well, look here. - What is it? - Some twerp with a gun. - Shoot him. - Come on, kid, hand it over. - Come and get it. (gun cocking) Punk. - Hey, you little son of a bitch. (mellow upbeat music) Argh! (thudding to floor) (gun firing) (gun firing) Joey! Joey! Joey! (thudding) - Uh! (light haunting music) - Argh! (thudding to floor) (light haunting music) - Okay, we're going down the ladder. (thudding blow) Uh! (groaning with effort) - Get up. Come on. What goes around, comes around, huh, Jimmy? You know, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You killed my father, now I get to kill you. - Alright, let Tony leave, he doesn't have to see this. - Shut up. Be good for him, teach him a lesson. So long, you son of a bitch. (gun firing) Stupid gun's filled with blanks! - You can believe mine isn't. James, get the other gun. - Shit. (light haunting music) - I got him covered. - Well, that's good, because the pen may be mightier than the sword, but I don't believe it's any match for .45. - Well, I'll be goddamned. - Yeah, Vinny, you probably will be. Let's go. (background chattering) - [Officer] Come on, come on. - Watch the hair. - Get in there. - No more than that. - Ah-huh. - [Thomas] Ah, let's see, I heard a gunshot. (police radio broadcasting quietly) - You okay? - Yeah. - Get in the car, Chuck, in the car. - [Chris] Is it true Jimmy didn't kill anyone? - That's right, Father, he walked in on a sting, when the gun went off, Argento triggered a blood bag. (gun firing) As far as anyone knows, he's dead until he testifies before a Grand Jury tomorrow. - So what happens now? - Well, Argento will enter the Witness Protection Program and the Minnelli family will be brought down. - I meant Jimmy. - Oh, he's broken no laws, so in a few more hours, once it's all blown over, you'll be free, Jimmy to do whatever you want. Excuse me. (light melodic music) - Thanks for coming to my rescue. - You came to mine. It's like you said before, dude, we ain't so different from each other? - I got a feeling, Tony, you're gonna turn out just fine. - It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. - You take care. - You too. - If you'd like, James, you are most welcome to stay on here. - I'm sure we can find you something full-time, if you want it. Come on. - I appreciate the offer. (light melodic orchestral music) - So are you thinking of that coastal town and the charter boats? - Among other things. - So you think they might need a nurse in that town? - Well, if they don't, I guess we'll have to keep driving, till we find one that does.
