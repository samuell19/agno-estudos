--== McEphie ==-- Let's do it again. So many angry people Can no longer count 'em Despite everything, there are people I can still count on Though I cause pain to my mom And bring trouble to my dad I never rush, I don't bother As long as we dream together I waited long enough For this day For the fire to burn, yes I did pray Stared at it hard so it won't go away I did everything for it to stay Okay, fine, a lot of them are good The bullets pierced through every wound We're the fools in the scene But you never knew where we came from I overdosed like my bros Truth is I'm really broke Smoked pot until I choked Felt like I hit some coke We're comin' at ya, at ya Busted my bros, but they get away With some help from Coppa All I want is to throw some shade To all my fellas So I can blame them straight To whisper evil, there's so much hate Before you speak, hold it and wait But nobody can shoot me down -'Cause I will rise until… -Hazel! Get ready for the chorus. For I want to succeed! Hazel! What are you doing? You're going home. What is this? What are you wearing? You look like a hostess. Good evening, ma'am, sir. Who are you? I'm Douglas Capati. I'm a big fan of your daughter. I'm known in the hip-hop world as "Dog-style Douglas." These are my friends. This is Johnny, a.k.a. "Mastafaka." That's Kokoy, a.k.a. "Street Boytoy X." That's Santi, "Thrasher Kid." Hazel, let's go. Get in the car. You have an early audition tomorrow. Hey! What are you doing here? Are you smoking with them? We're jamming! We're going home now! Damn it, Hazel. Who are they? It's a good thing those drug addicts didn't rape you. They're not like that. They're musicians. Didn't I tell you not to get close with your fans? They only want to take photos with you. -Hi, Hazel! -You smile. Smile. Look at those eye bags! You look like a zombie! I don't know why you won't sleep early. -How will you get the lead role? -That's why there's makeup. Is that a pimple on your chin? Oh my God, Hazel! What do you want me to do? Tell my pimple not to grow? Hey! Look at that! When did they put that up? There's another one on the freeway. Didn't they say they were going to renew Hazel's contract? Go to your room so your mom will stop. See, Hazel! They didn't get you again. Because you're always frowning. You can't help but frown when your mom yaps to no end. What? What did you say? Honey! They delivered the stockings you ordered online. Do you think you're going to be in demand forever? You could be preparing for your audition now, but what are you doing? Rapping? If they want to cast me, they'll cast me. I'll get some salad from the fridge. It's really good. How will they cast you as the lead? You don't try your best in your auditions. And there are so many rising stars who are good. Idiot! Go to sleep. Instead of wasting your time doing whatever. Why don't you get a job so you're not dependent on me? Hazel. Don't be like that. Your mom quit being a teacher so she could support your acting career. Why? How much was she earning? Do you think we could have built this house if we depended on your vulcanizing shop? Enough! Stop it. She needs to sleep. Do you know why we pushed you to become an actor? Because you're dumb. Your dad and I have known that since you were little. Even your uncles and aunts know. You're not smart. You fail your classes. So, be thankful that you were born beautiful. Where would you be if you weren't in showbiz? Miss, is there an international flight leaving soon? To where, ma'am? -What? -Where are you going? Anywhere. Somewhere I don't need a visa. Or Japan. I have a multiple entry visa. Give me a moment. I'll be right back. Delete that. I'm going to report you to your boss. I'm so sorry. My grandmother is a huge fan. I was going to send it to her because it's her birthday. I'll delete it now. There. -What's your grandmother's name? -Janet Toledo. -How old? -Seventy-seven, ma'am. Give me that. Where? Fuku-o-ka. That's fine. Just hurry. Where are you? You have an audition tomorrow-- I'm going on a vacation. Don't bother me. Vacation? You can't! You have an audition-- -Good morning. -Good morning. -How was the catch? -Not so good. There are fewer fish lately. -Climate change sucks. -Climate change sucks. Louie! We have visitors arriving from Kyoto later. Clean the tables thoroughly. -Yes. -And fix your collar. Yes. Welcome. Yes. Sure. What a glutton. Oh my goodness! That usually happens. Will you be able to eat all of that? That's not your problem, I'm paying anyway. It stinks. I'm on vacation. No pictures, please. Why would I take your picture? You dropped your phone. -All right, take care. -Mister, wait. How do I get here? By car? Bus, train, or walk if it's close. Miss, you can download the Saga travel support app. -Everything's there. -My phone is off. -Why don't you turn it on? We have Wi-Fi. -Just tell me how to go there. I'm sorry. I don't know how via public transport. Do you have a car? Can you take me? -I'm working. -I'll pay you. No need, I already have a job. You take care. Help me! I'm lost! Here. How much is this? That's on me. I have money. If you say so. How did you end up in Saga? There aren't a lot of tourists here, especially Filipinos. That's the point. There's no one I know and no one knows me. You'll really get lost then. No one gets lost forever. Especially if there are good people who will help you. Especially if they're from your country. I'm not saying… that's what you should do. But maybe you should. Okay, fine. If you can wait until I'm done with work, I can take you to your hotel. -Where is it? -Saga. Why? Is that far? Four towns away. Louie! -Yes! -Please come in… All right, I'll see you later. 7:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m.? How much do you earn here? You shouldn't ask that. Especially here. What's the big deal? I'll ride in the back. Ride inside. I like it here. You're going to get cold. And you might fall. I'm not stupid. I didn't say you were stupid. Suit yourself. Can we pass by a convenience store? Let's buy snacks and drinks. Let's pass by a convenience store. I don't understand why hot air is coming out of the AC in my hotel room. That's not an air conditioner. Hold this. I want to try that. Hey! Hey! -You've already bought a lot. -It's not your money I'm spending. How do I use this? Show me. I want to try. Where should I put these? Anywhere. -Mind if I sit? -Go ahead. What? You're Filipino, right? You really don't recognize me? Thirsty? Don't be afraid, everybody! Because here comes… I'll go ahead. It's another hour-long trip. You really don't know them? No. Are you serious? I'm a has-been. I'm not popular anymore. I used to be so famous. Now, nobody remembers me. Nobody knows me. What did you just do? Those were big commercials that I did when I was a kid. You really don't know Mighty Baby Nene? Defender of the oppressed! That one got really good ratings! Where did you grow up? Under a rock? Here. In Japan. Since I was ten. That's why I don't know a lot of Filipino shows. I thought you didn't want anyone to know you. But now you're crying? So, I'm really a has-been. You can handle it. Handle what? Your… You being a has-been. You can handle it. No… That's not what I meant. Are we going to have sex now? You have a dirty mind. It's okay if you don't have a girlfriend. -Do you have one? -I don't. -A spouse? -No! Then it's perfect. Let's go for a walk. Whenever I go to the mall, I'd get swarmed by fans. It's literally a stampede. Everything I want… toys, chocolates, gadgets-- I get them all. -What about a boyfriend? -Except for that. My parents would kill me. But when I grew older, I got fewer projects. Why? Because they liked me as a child star. I was so cute then. Just so you know, I still get offers, but for supporting roles? From being the lead, they'll demote me to a supporting role? At least that's an offer. There are so many celebrities now. Like that Tana Frias. Just one viral video, and she's suddenly an actress. She's not even pretty. She has lice, and she's smelly. How gross! I don't know why they keep giving her projects. Instead of you? You know what, if they don't like me anymore, I don't like them either! I don't need them. I can handle being on my own. In fact, I don't want to be an actress anymore. I quit! Hey! Keep quiet. You're not in Manila. If you quit, what will you do with your life? Take a picture of me there! -Hurry up! -Keep quiet! Hurry! Make it candid. It's okay! Give me your phone. Use yours. Just send them via Bluetooth later. Make it candid. Count to three. Take one here. Can I see? One more. Stop counting. Just take the photo. Okay, that's plenty. Send it through Bluetooth. Darn it, I need to turn on my phone. Why don't you turn it on? People might start calling. -So what? -I don't want to be bothered. You can still use Bluetooth in airplane mode. Really? -Turn on airplane mode! -Okay. It's sending. You're so used to your photos being taken. Of course! I've been in showbiz for so long. If you're going to quit, what will you do? Do I really have to answer now? Can't I enjoy my vacation first? It's the first time I'm spoiling myself. I'm only asking if you have other talents aside from acting. So, do you? Take me back to my hotel. I have something for you. What are you going to give me? There's bottled tea there. Get one. Gross. It's not home-brewed. How picky. You're giving me bottled tea? You don't want it? Then give it to me. Give me one. Natural tea is healthier than bottled tea. Louie, get me a tissue from the bathroom. Hurry! My clothes are wet. Come on. You're too slow. I'll be leaving then. Louie, don't leave me alone! Is there a problem? I'm looking for my mom. Where were you? Your father is also worried. Please keep a close eye on him always, so he doesn't wander off and get lost. Yes. What? I thought you went home? What favor were you gonna ask me? Can you turn on the TV? You fear being alone? Fear is such a heavy word. Can you check on me while I'm here in Saga? Check on you? Because… I might choke while eating nuts. Or I might slip in the shower and break my skull. Or what if I overdose on sleeping pills, and no one knows because I'm alone? You want me to come here every day? Such a hassle. I can call you if you want, but… your phone's on airplane mode. It's off. -Give it to me. -All right. What did you do? I turned on the "Do Not Disturb". You won't hear any notifications. I also saved my number under Louie Puyat. I set it as a favorite. Your phone will only ring if I'm the one calling. I didn't expect you to be so smart. What if my parents call me? It won't ring. Only when I call. I can set them as favorites-- Don't! How many times will you call me a day? Once. At night, after my shift. What's your number? What if… I drown in the bathtub in the morning? What a hassle. Okay, I'll call three times. Morning, in the afternoon, and at night. What if I'm too busy to answer your calls? If you don't answer at least one of my calls, I'll assume something has happened to you. That's when I'll get worried. You okay with that? Okay. That's fine. Still alive? I am. You okay? I'm visiting a shrine. How pretty! Hey! Keep your voice down. Why won't my drink come out? Where? Here at the vending machine. How much did you put inside? One hundred yen. What's the price written there? One hundred thirty yen. Still breathing? Head still intact? Yes. Yes. I love you. Thank you. Heart still beating? Louie, maybe three times a day is too much. How about… How about calling me twice a day? Once in the morning and once at night. And in the morning, can you not call too early? I'm alive! I am so alive! I'm dead. Alive! CALL ME URGENT Hello, Director? Is this really you? Yes. Why aren't you answering my calls? I'm sorry, my phone was in silent mode. For three days? You're driving me crazy. Anyway, I called you directly because you didn't show up at my auditions. Your mother said you have amoebiasis. Yes. It's actually itchy. Itchy? What's itchy with amoebiasis? My throat was itchy. Anyway, I'm not satisfied with the auditionees. So, I'm holding another round. Please show up this time because personally, -I want you to be the lead actress. -Really? Yes. But people kept telling me you don't have fans anymore. And your acting is so bad. So, I want to prove them wrong. So, you better show up this time, okay? I don't want to be an actress anymore. Why didn't you call this morning? -I tried calling you last night-- -What if I fell from the top of the hotel? You hung up on me. You even turned off your phone. And by the tone of your voice, I knew you were annoyed with me. -So, why would I call? -You're too sensitive. I was just tired yesterday. I'll kick your ass. Then do it! Come on, try hitting me! How can you? I'm too far away from you. I'm here at the restaurant. I'm at the restaurant where you work, but you're not here. Sorry about that. I took the day off. Louie, I got lost again. -The cherry blossoms? -Yes. Well… you go to… Excuse me. Your fly is open. Why are you here again? Where are you going? Do you know how to get to Arita? It's too far from here. Are you mad at me? You told me to check on you every day because you were alone and something might happen to you. The fact that I'm turning down your calls means I'm still alive, right? How can I do that if I'm dead? You're too dense. You're the one who keeps getting lost. Because I'm not from here. What do you expect? Why are you so affected? -You're too-- -What? I'm too what? You're too confusing! I know you're going through something. But can't you show a little appreciation for the effort of others? Fine, thank you. Thank you very much! Why are you overreacting? I get the sulking. But the anger? The temper? What's gotten into you? I didn't call yesterday to check on you. I knew you were okay. It's too quiet here. If you get in trouble, then you're an idiot. I wanted to show you around. I have three days off starting today. Because we're both Filipinos, right? We'll go around town, and then… That's it. You're so thoughtful, Lou-Lou. What, Lou-Lou? Hey, I didn't take the day off for you. Just to make it clear. -Come. I'll take you to the station-- -Wait. Wait a minute. I feel guilty for wasting your day off. Okay, how about this? What if I stay here tonight and we go around tomorrow? I already took some side jobs in those three days. Not here. I have to make some deliveries. Then after that. Will it take the whole day? -No. -It's settled then. So, we're on for tomorrow? It's up to you. There's a cheap inn there where you can stay. Why an inn? Where will you sleep? At your house. But I live alone! So what? I'm not gonna harass you. Let's go. -Did you guys feel that? -Feel what? Earthquake. What did she say? Why do earthquakes occur? Well, aside from being near the Pacific Ring of Fire, Japan sits on four tectonic plates: the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, and Philippine plates. They bump into each other. That's why earthquakes are so normal here. I didn't get any of what you said. It must feel good to have studied. You're more confident to face things because you get how the world works. I only got to third grade because my parents pushed me into showbiz. I didn't learn that in school. When I was a kid, I used to go to the National Planetarium in Manila. My dad was a janitor there, so I got in for free. I got interested in geology and planetary science. So, why are you working as a waiter and fisherman? Hey, those are respectable jobs. Unlike in the Philippines, here you can earn a lot being a waiter or a fisherman. Okay, fine, but-- I earn more than office workers in the Philippines. And they're college graduates, unlike me. Okay, but what I mean is, you're not really into fishing or waiting tables. I'm fine with that. Really? More than geology and planetary blah-blah? If you're earning a lot here, why don't you go to college and make yourself useful? Why don't you ask yourself that? -Back to school? At my age? -You have money. Why not? If you really want it. I do want it. I just don't have the time. What will happen to me and my parents? I thought you said you were a has-been. -Now you have time-- -You jerk! -I'll beat you up. -You can't be noisy here! -I don't care! I'm not Japanese! -Don't… Don't be loud. Why are you being a jerk? I just said you should go to college, and you rambled on and on. On and on. Whatever. I'm content where I am. We're here. That's your house? Yes. Leave your shoes here. Put them inside. Careful of the wooden panel. You might tear a hole. It's just paper. Oh no, I tore a hole! You own this house? Yes. Like really own it? You had it built? I bought it. How? It's an akiya. An abandoned house. The government sold it at a very low price. When I learned about this being an akiya, I got it right away. Even if it's far from Hiroshima. It's better than staying with my aunt who nags a lot. Her husband's a gangster. His left pinkie was cut off. Here. Here. This is real tea. It's hot. It was easy for you to buy your own house. We had to save up for seven years for ours. I was the only one interested in this house. Why? Because the previous owner, a spinster, killed herself. She drank muriatic acid. Her body was found right there where you are sitting. Are you serious? Do I look like I'm kidding? I remember my first week here, around this time. I was cooking in the kitchen, and I heard… footsteps… coming from upstairs. Damn it, you're doing this on purpose. This is your strategy, so I'll sleep in your room. -You have a weird mind. -I got you there, didn't I? I'm just sharing my experiences in this house. -Really? -Yes. Miss Sadako told me you have a crush on me. You wish. Since you saw me, you haven't been able to stop talking about how beautiful I am. -Am I right, or am I right? -Wrong. Gosh. You're enjoying yourself too much. I have to cook. That's why you offered to bring me to my hotel? You're fooling yourself. But you can't fool me. You're so vain. What else did you talk about? Come on. Nope. Fine. You're the one who really wants me anyway. That's why you wanted to sleep here. With all the actors I've worked with, what makes you think you're my type? But you're not allowed to have a boyfriend, right? You must feel really dry. As if I'd sleep with just anyone. Excuse me! If you think-- What? I don't have any extra clothes. Here. You do it. I still have to cook. I'm not hungry yet. I'm not just cooking for you. Come on. I'm your crush anyway. I find you pretty, but you're not my crush. I'll prepare your bedding. -Hey! -Damn you! I can't sleep because of your ghost stories. Take a pill. It won't work. So, either I join you here, or you join me downstairs. There's no ghost, okay? Too late. It's already in my head. That's your fault. If you don't join me, I'll play loud music downstairs. What are you going to do when you get back to the Philippines? What? You said you'll quit acting. What are you doing? Actually, I thought about what you asked me. Truth is, I really like Filipino hip-hop music. The underground stuff. So, as a hobby, my rapper friends and I record original rap songs. Here. Listen to it. But it's not yet done. You're the one rapping? I sang the chorus. You can sing? Yeah, but not songs with high notes. I'm more chill, like Moira. Who's Moira? Just listen to it. Are you at the chorus? So, that's it. Wait. Did I get it right? You'll quit acting so that-- So that I can focus on hip-hop music and form a hip-hop group like Fergie. You know the Black Eyed Peas, right? What? Oh no! You might lose your career completely. That's really hurtful. Okay. I'm going to sleep now. I'm sorry. Your rap song was really bad. HAZEL ILAGAN, A FALLING STAR? Just ignore them. After you laughed at me last night? I'm sorry. I was thinking of it… There's nothing else I'm good at but acting. You really want to quit? People don't want me anymore. Because… you're bad at it? You want me to hit you with all my trophies? Then why don't they like you anymore? I don't know. -You really don't know? -No, I don't. Maybe they don't like your attitude? Or your ego? I googled you last night. That's what people are saying. You look down on people. You don't ride the elevator with strangers. Wow. How arrogant. Does your poop smell good? Are your bones made of gold? Even to your fans, you're rude-- I grew up in an illusion. No one guided me while growing up. No one told me, "Hey, Hazel, you may be famous, but you're not God. So, be good to the people around you." It was enough for my parents that I was earning a lot. The worst thing was… I knew something was wrong with me, but I couldn't fix it alone. Sometimes, our parents can disappoint us. Yes, we love them, but they have their own shortcomings. But Hazel, we're grown-ups now. We should take hold of our lives. We should be in control. You became bad because of other people, and that's their fault. But if you stay that way, then it's your fault. Leave those in the sink. I'll take care of it. No. I'll do it. When you're done, leave everything here. I'll wash the dishes. Give me a smile! Smile. Another one with the fish. Hurry. Smile. There you go. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. Good morning. Your friend is beautiful. She could be an actress. Here. No, that has a lot of sugar. Come on. Aren't you sick of green tea? Take it. People in Japan are so respectful. I wish it was the same in the Philippines. If you live here, you'll acquire the culture of respect. How come you're rude to me? -Because you're a brat! -Ouch! Let's go. We still have time. I can't understand anything. The story is on the brochure. I'll explain it to you later. Enjoy it for now. -Thank you very much. -Thank you very much. I'm not good at this. Just draw anything. I'll try. That looks good. Your turn. There! You want to add anything else? That's fine. You need to sign the back. What's Hazel in Japanese? Hezeru. Just the first syllable of your name. Am I doing it right? Nice! Can I buy this as a souvenir? Excuse me. Can we buy this plate as a souvenir? It will take about three months for the glaze firing to finish. It will take three months to glaze the plate. If you want, I can claim it and send it to you in the Philippines. -Okay, that's fine. -That's okay with you? Okay, wait here. This is what you see now, but when it's high tide, they're all submerged. That's amazing. How the tide works. There are three factors that affect the tide. The strongest is the moon. The sun also has something to do with it, and the rotation of the earth. Stop your lecture. It's fascinating. Yes, but I can't understand it. Why don't you study at a university, so even if you talk all day, someone will listen? Can I still stay at your place tonight? Okay with me. If you want to extend your vacation, you can still stay with me. Until when? Up to you. How about when you get back to work? You trust me enough to leave me alone in your place? So what? You're not a bad person. Careful. You think I'm not a bad person? Kinda. Ouch! It's so quiet here in Japan. Makes me miss Manila. Really? Why? The silence can be overwhelming. When it's noisy, you know you're not alone. Can you play some music? Something upbeat, please! All right. I got it. What song is that? I don't know. It was on my parents' CD. Okay. This is my only upbeat song. You don't know this? Nope. -Really? -No! That's impossible. You look silly. You're embarrassing yourself. Silly? -Silly? What? Join me! -It's silly! Come on. I googled how you got famous when you were a kid. You were in Little Miss Manila. Right? And you danced like this. Don't! Don't do it! Okay, ready… Hang on. Stop it! So annoying! You danced like this. Enough. -Hey, sit down. -You did this, too. How about this? Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Come on. Teach me. Teach me. Come on. I know you want to join me. Hazel. Hello, Hazel? Hazel, the tabloids say you're in Japan. Is it true? Dad, you're on a video call. Look at the screen so we can see each other. Is that so? Wait. Hazel, what's going on? Why aren't you answering our calls? Where are you? In Japan. In Japan? Hazel, Director Fred keeps asking about you. The audition will be next week. We don't know what to tell him. We're running out of excuses. Is that Hazel? Hazel, your mother's here. I'll hang up now. Don't. Don't hang up. I'll talk to her. How nice of you to finally call us! How dare you ignore our calls! You think you can live without us now? You want to disown us? You don't need us? Mom, I didn't call to argue. Where are you? In Japan. What? You're in Japan? You want to be a Japanese entertainer now? You're just going to waste everything we worked for? Mom, I won't be a Japanese entertainer! I called because I wanted to say sorry. You know what, Hazel… you're too hurtful with your words. You make it seem like we only want your money. You're lucky you didn't experience hardship. When I was younger, do you know how it was? I only had five pairs of panties. I had to wash them repeatedly so I could wear them again. What about you? How many pairs of panties do you own? And how much are they? What's your problem, Hazel? Why did you go there without telling us? As if you'd have let me leave! You don't even let me eat pizza when I want to. I can't even buy new clothes without your approval. And if you do say yes, you always make me feel like a spoiled brat. You don't like my friends. When people say I'm a snob, it's always my fault. When I fail my audition, it's my fault again. Whenever I have pimples, you blame me for that, too. It's suffocating, Mom! Hazel. I'll talk to your mother. Maybe we need time to cool our heads. Let's talk soon. Okay. Hazel, always remember, we love you very much. Thank you very much. "Thank you?" It's, "Good morning." Oh, right. It's bad to have tea on an empty stomach. I'm just tasting it. You try. You should have brewed it longer. And you need to put more leaves. Louie, what if I just stay here? You'll extend your vacation? No, I want to stay here with you. I can help you with fishing and making deliveries. I'll brew tea and cook for you. It's not hard to learn those things, right? I can't imagine it. Which one? Me being here or me fishing? I can't imagine seeing your face every day. Don't you want it? When you're sad, I'll make you happy. Why would I be sad? So, you don't like my idea? I do. -I like it but-- -But? But you should think about it longer. There. It tastes better. Have I told you that I've never had a boyfriend? You told me the other day. Can you be my first boyfriend? What? You heard me. What happens when you go back to the Philippines? But I'm here now. I'm already here. Are you game? Babe, let me try. Did I pass? -Looks like your body can't handle it. -I just need practice, babe. Wait. You're serious? You're my girlfriend? I'm your boyfriend? And I'll stay here for good. What kind of visa do you have? You can't just move to Japan. There's a process for that. I can be an illegal immigrant. Isn't that common here? Don't. I won't get caught. -I won't have to leave-- -That's enough! Your voice is too loud. You want a drink? What's that? Shochu. Here. Too strong? Louie, what's that? Why is the plate broken? The one painted with a temple? It's a house. A mansion. With three floors. Maybe the strong wind shattered it. Or maybe… the ghost did it. Oh no. Why were you crying and drunk on your birthday? How did you know? Miss Sadako told me. What else did she tell you? She said… you're hardworking… You're just flattering me. But you're hiding something inside. Your sadness. Your heartache. Your resentment. Like a volcano storing lava within. It's magma. It's only called lava if it reaches the surface. It's magma. So, what really happened? You shouldn't be miserable on your birthday. I don't know. It's just… I watched this sad movie. It hit you that hard? You had to get drunk? What's the title of the movie? I forget. Then tell me what the movie is about. Go fix your things. Fix my things? Fix my things? Why? I'll take you back to your hotel in Saga. You want me to leave? I have work tomorrow. I thought it was okay for me to stay here. You have a life waiting for you in the Philippines. I told you I want to stop acting! You're the breadwinner, right? What about your parents? I will still send them money. You told me the pay is better here. Even as a waiter, a fisherman-- You'll have a hard time finding a job. What do you think of me? That I'm too stupid to work? If you overstay, you'll be an illegal immigrant! If you get caught, they'll deport you, just like they did to my parents! Do you understand? Your voice is too loud. I was ten years old when we came to Japan. Because life in the Philippines was hard. It's a typical illegal immigrant story. We got caught. I wrote a letter addressed to the justice minister, in pure Japanese, no English, to beg them to let us stay here. But the decision of the judges was… that I could stay here in Japan… as a special permanent resident, as long as my parents returned to the Philippines. But you're already settled here? You said you are content. Remember when you told me I should enroll at a university? That was my plan. It was my dream. When my parents left me with my aunt in Hiroshima, I took my studies seriously. I studied hard in senior high, so I could enroll at Kyushu University, and get a degree in Planetary and Earth Sciences. After graduating, I was going to be a geophysics scientist. I'd have been able to help my parents. I was going to build a big house for them in the Philippines. A mansion with three floors. With a swimming pool and a garden. They wouldn't have to work anymore. They could just relax every day. Even if my Japanese classmates bullied me almost every week, I didn't care. I endured it. I knew I was an outsider. As long as my goal in life was clear, that was enough. Upon graduating high school, when I was supposed to enter Kyushu University… I found out my parents had separated in the Philippines. They both had new partners. And the only reason for all my effort… and hardship? It disappeared. So, you gave up your dreams for what? To be a fisherman? To be a waiter? Yes. My God, Louie. You can achieve more. Why don't you fix your… Say that to yourself. Why can't you? Hazel, I already gave up. But you're only about to. Will you leave everything behind for a life like this? I'll go to work now. I'll do the dishes. -Good morning! -Good morning. Good morning. -Good morning! -Good morning. You okay there? Of course. No ghosts haunting you? There might be one. Really? No. I'm just kidding. Hazel? Mom. How are you? I'm here in your room, cleaning your mess. The posters you ripped from the wall. Sorry for the mess, Mom. Hazel. Your dad and I talked. I'm sorry for our shortcomings as your parents. Everything we do is for your sake. But we didn't notice that you're not a kid anymore. You're already 21. You can make your own decisions. But, Hazel. We have a favor to ask you. Come back home, please. Don't pass up Director Fred's offer. Mom, what if I want to quit acting? What if I really become a has-been? What if I don't earn money and become useless? Will you still love me? Of course, my Hazel. We're a family, right? You and your father, God put us in this world together. We don't have any choice but to love each other. How cheesy, Mom. I'm home. Are we going somewhere? I have something to tell you, but please don't get mad. Of course. Did you break something in the kitchen? I don't think I can stay here. I told you so. You just wouldn't listen. Just drop me off at the train station. No, let's go to your hotel to drop your stuff, and then we'll eat Saga beef. After that, I'll drive you back. I don't want to bother you. I don't mind. I'm your boyfriend, remember? Try this. So nice. -It's beautiful, right? -Wow. Wait for me. Here's your ice cream. -Is that your favorite? -Oh, yeah. You know, taste this. This is for you. The ones on the top… We'll hang our wishes here. Where? You can put it there. I WISH THAT TRAFFIC WILL NOT BE BAD WHEN I GET HOME. Want a picture? Both of us. Okay. Hello. Excuse me. Can you take a photo of me and my girlfriend? Sure. What's up? Thank you for everything. If not for you, I would've gotten lost here in Japan. Because you didn't download the travel guide. I leave for Fukuoka tomorrow. Then I fly back to Manila. I need to prepare for my audition next week. I can't sing well. I can't go back to school. All I'm good at is acting. So, I'll do better. I'm not giving up. We're still having dinner, right? Why say goodbye now? I'll drive you back to your hotel. I already downloaded the travel guide. I promise I won't get lost. Someone's about to cry. You're gonna cry. What happens to us? No. No. Don't. -Hassle. -It is. So, we're breaking up? Looks like it. Gosh! I only had a boyfriend for a few days. We don't have break-up lines? When you visit the Philippines, let me know. Let's go to the planetarium so I can finally get your planet tectonic stuff. And, here. For you. What for? When the sun is too bright. Thanks again. Thank you. Where's your friend? She found her way. Louie, you haven't called in a while. Dad. Dad, let's wait for Mom. Louie, can you see me? Louie, why did you call? Why the sudden call? Is everything okay? Mom, Dad… How are you? How are you doing there? Don't worry about us. We're doing fine here in Bulacan. Same here in Manila. What about you? How's your work in Saga? Despite being like this, I still get hurt! You're too heartless! Someday, karma will hit you. When that happens, I hope your tongues get hit so you can't insult me anymore! Cut! Hazel, I like your acting, okay? A mean girl with a heart of silver. -Sure. -You get what I'm saying? Yes, of course. I don't see you as the lead. One glance at the lead, and it needs to be, like, bam! A star! Miss Friendship! Like a saint! Get it? Hazel, are you willing to play the antagonist? Sure. Of course. People don't like me anyway, so I might be an effective villain. That's not true. See? Let me do it. Actually… Ma'am Hazel, here's what you asked me to buy. Thanks, Poy. -Here's your change. -Keep it. Get some bread. Take two pieces. -Guys, have some cheese bread. -Thank you. Hello? Who's this? You still alive? Who's this? I'm here in Manila. Are you serious? OMG, you're really here! You're using a Philippine number, Louie! Can we meet? Oh no, Louie. I'm at a shoot. We might finish late. Is that so? Wanna come here? I'll send you the address. Is that okay? Sure. Sir! Are you Louie? Are you Louie? Follow me. Let him in. Sir, follow me. My gosh, you're really here! Come here. Wait. Here. Sorry that I ignored you. Our love team's fans are outside. JacZel? You know fans. They don't want me with other guys. You're a big star again. I got lucky. Why did you come home? Just visiting. I'm staying with my father and his partner. My half-brother is there, too. You reconciled with them? What about your mom? Next week, I'll stay in Bulacan with her. What? Why are you smiling? You've become more handsome. Flattery. Tomorrow… Are you free tomorrow? Okay. This is Louie, my friend from Japan. Hello. Wait here, Louie. Sure. I'll stay here. Sure. Let's go. Sorry, the director wanted us to view the rushes. He had some comments. What time is it? You want to eat? We're shooting sequence 47 next. Okay. -Should I change? -Yes. You're too busy. How about tomorrow? I just have a morning show guesting. Let's have lunch after. Sure. Just text me where. All right. Good luck with your shoot. I'll go ahead. Okay. Good afternoon. -Miss Hazel Ilagan? -Yes. Did my companion arrive? He left an hour and a half ago, ma'am. Our taping was delayed. There was an earthquake drill. I'm here. Where are you? I waited like a fool for hours. Where are you? I'll go there now. You want me to move? Please talk to me. Maybe it's not obvious, but… Hazel, I didn't return to the Philippines just to visit my parents. I know. I won't beat around the bush. Hazel, I like you. I really like you, so tell me if you feel the same. Don't give me false hope. I can't, Louie. But it doesn't mean I don't like you. It doesn't mean I don't value what happened and what we felt in Saga. The timing's not right, Louie. I just got my career back. Hazel, it's not… Hazel, it's not your fault. Maybe we won't… I inquired at Kyushu University before I left Saga. I'll enroll when I get back. Really? Good for you, Louie. That's great. So, even if we're together while I'm here, it won't last… right? What do you think? I'll leave first so they won't see us together. Oh, wait. For you. What's this? It's beautiful, Louie. Thank you. Look, it's Hazel! Hazel Ilagan! Isn't she an actress?
