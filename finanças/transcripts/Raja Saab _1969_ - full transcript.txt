The orphans in India I will kick you out in a snap! Even I swear on all the orphans of India.. I won't do anything like that in the princess's presence. If you say so, I won't even look at her.

And your matter! Why don't you understand? Even you have a beard and moustache on your face. So, what is my mistake if I got a moustache and beard? Your problem is that you didn't get brains with the beard. Good that the orphanage people removed you. You won't dream about being a king the whole day. You will do some work at least. You will earn with your hands. I will just get food to eat twice if I earn with my ends. - Do you want to eat six times in a day? - No. I want to become a king. I know that. I know that, my dad! And may the almighty make you one. But till the time you become one.. Won't you work as something or not to fill you stomach? What work do I know? Who will give me any iob? Leave that responsibility to me. I will arrange an excellent job for you, okay? - How many liters, sir? - Ten. Hey, hey what are you doing? Are you sleeping? You fool, you donkey! Even water isn't pumped out in Bombay.. Like how you have squandered my petrol. Take your uniform and get lost from here. Sir, you well has a lot of petrol. But if you remove me.. I won't get a iob anywhere else. And you shouldn't get another job too! - Sir.. - I said, get out. I was calling you since when! You weren't listening to me at all.

Then it is you and your fate after that. - It is enough for me now. - Sir, brain fry.. - Bring some brain fry. - Fry sir's brains. Mr. D'Mello. This is our Raju. I had talked about a boy yesterday. Yes, Raju. Do you know how to massage? Massage. A body massage. Some boys and girls are needed.. For training as masseurs where Mr. D'Mello works. The salary is one fifty rupees, isn't it? And tips on top of that. Nobody gives anything less that five or ten rupees. The rich, the mill owners, Britishers, kings... Yes, kings and emperors. They call us to their homes and make us massage them. And on top of that, they give us big tips. Is that the matter? Even I will become a masseur, I will surely become one. Greetings, your maiesty.. Are you new? Yes, D'Mello has sent me. His maiesty is up. His maiesty is upstairs. And listen, the king likes to be massaged in his sleep. Have you brought the oils? Yes? Yes. - Do you see those stairs? - Yes. Go up. Yes? - Go! - Yes. Your maiesty.. Your maiesty.. Your maiesty! Who are you? Who are you? I am Raju, the masseur. - Are you a masseur or a polisher? - Yes? - Yes! Your fingers should work like you're.. Playing a piano while massaging. Come on, play it. - I don't know how to play a piano. - You don't know? It doesn't matter. I will play your piano. You will play it? What else? Will my late father play it? - Remove it. - Yes? - Undress. Don't move! Don't move! It's tickling me. Please don't play my piano more, your majesty. Hey, where are you going? You will here from today. - Yes? - Yes, I have laughed for the first time in my life. I am very happy with you. In lieu of this.. I am willing to fulfill any of your desires. Will you fulfill my desires? The family of Raghus have this legacy they may.. Sacrifice their life, but not break their promise. Ask. Please make me a king. You want to become a king. I will make you one. What did you say? You wish to become a king? That isn't possible. Kings are made.. - Kings are born. - So please borne me too. You asked me my wish, I told you. But what do you think? Kings and emperors are happy? Never. Look at me. I have this palace, wealth, servants, everything but.. But all this has no worth to you. Because you have all this but.. It's uncle's trunk call from Rathodgad. What does he want to say? His grand daughter, the princess Poonam who had.. Acted insolently with you he is asking forgiveness for that. She is forgiven. He wants to ask forgiveness from you. Okay. Get up.. wait.. you go. Let God be merciful, uncle, I am Pratap Singh here. Let God be merciful. I came to know.. About your return from Tokyo. And Poonam told me.. That you wrote her a letter from Tokyo to Singapore. And the letter that she wrote to me as an answer.. If she'd written it to you, you'd die of shame. I know, son. But the two of you never met each other. And I don't want to meet him too. I am not interested in meeting her. I don't want that the decision made by the elders.. Should be undone because of your differences. - I want you to be married now. - But I.. Listen.. Poonam is mature now. - And the Prince of Arzpur.. - Has sent a proposal. Uncle, you just accept his proposal. That insolent girl won't get another proposal like this. I wish.. Poonam and you to meet each other.. And stay together for some days. You will understand each other. Maybe the bitterness between you two will fade away. - See.. - This is my order. Reach the Oberoi, Srinagar on.. The evening of the first of this coming month. Poonam will meet you there. May God be merciful! Did you see that? The kings and emperors have to marry on orders too. But I won't let this happen. I will avenge this insult with insult. Listen.. - You want to become a king, isn't it? - Yes. I will make you a king. - You will make me one. - Surely. I will train you. And I will send you to Kashmir.. As the Prince Pratap Singh from Chandinagar. - Are you telling the truth? - Yes. - I will introduce you to Princess Poonam there. - You will? Yes. And do you what you have to do there? Yes. I will fold my hands, bow my head.. And thank her for meeting me. No! You won't do anything like that. You will insult her just like how she insulted me in the letter. But, your maiesty.. How can a poor orphan like me insult a princess? You won't be a poor orphan at that time. You will be His Maiesty at that time. Your wallet will be full of money. You will have wonderful clothes. You will have exquisite cars and hero like hair. Your maiesty.. Please look at this for a moment. I am seeing. Not me, sir. Here. - Who is this? - Recognize him. What a change! Yes, sir.. We will go to Srinagar with Raju tomorrow morning. Very good, sir. - Arrange for two seats in an aeroplane. - Yes, sir. See, the princess will be coming. I am sure, when she sees you. She will think you to be.. The prince, ask forgivness and tell you.. 'Sorry, I didn't think while writing that letter to you ♪ But you tell her.. Letter? Which letter? I didn't get any letter. And even if I would have got any letter.. I must have thrown it into the rubbish bin without reading it. Is it okay? Come on, tell me. 'Sorry, I wrote that letter to you by mistake ♪ This feminine part is for the princess. You tell the masculine part, the part after that. Letter? Which letter? I didn't get any letter. 'And even if I would have, I threw.. It in the rubbish bin without reading it. After that, you tell her. Uncle told me that you are beautiful, a maiden or fairy. But okay, you are nothing special. My Hong Kong secretary is more beautiful than you. But, when will I tell her all this? As soon as she arrives, in the launch. Then, shall we move? She must he arriving now. Her insult will start in such a way.. That when she arrives here, I won't.. I mean you won't be.. There for her welcome, but that cartoon prince. The prince? Yes, he is the prince of a poor state. He wishes to marry the princess and become rich. And he has come here for that reason. Please come. Do you remember all that I told you? Letter? What letter? I didn't get any letter.. Not now. You have to say it when she comes. - Here, she comes. - Letter, what letter? Your Maiesty, Pratapsingh of Chandigarh. Her Maiesty Poonamdevi of Rathoregarh. - Greetings. - Greetings. Please have a seat. You have a seat too. - Oh, I am standing still. - Have a seat. I never met you before this. But I think that I have seen you somewhere. Yes? My face.. Your maiesty, actually.. His maiesty's face is similar to the film actor Shashi Kapoor. It is possible that you saw some old film of his. When did you come back from foreign? Letter? What letter? I didn't get any letter. And even if I did get it, I threw it in the rubbish bin. Which letter are you talking about? Letter? What letter? I didn't get any letter. And even if I did get it, I threw it in the rubbish bin. What are you staring at? I am seeing how beautiful you are. Letter? What letter? I didn't get any letter. And even if I did get it, I threw it in the rubbish bin. All your luggage has been settled, Poonam. Your maiesty, His maiesty.. It seems that I have seen you earlier. We have met earlier. Even I used to think the same. But his face is similar to the film actor Shashi Kapoor. I had seen a movie of his. What was it's name? You are forgetting it, you must have seen Hunterwalli. It is a 'walli', isn't it? Letter? What letter? I didn't get any letter. And if I did get one, I threw it in the rubbish bin without reading. Come on! I clenched my teeth in anger. I winked from above.. I kicked from below. But you smiled.. And just stared at that Poonam! Did I bring you to Kashmir for this? But your maiesty, it is the same princess.. Whether she is the same or someone else.. Remember, if you don't insult her.. At tonight's party, you will have to pay.. For your traveling, boarding and food. But, I won't be able to pay you for that throughout my life. Okay, your maiesty. Tell me what I have to tell her. I will tell it to her face right away. Very good. Then you tell her in everyone's presence. That she is ugly. She is fat. She is cross-eyed. She has a flat nose. But this is false. She is very beautiful. Whether she is beautiful or some maiden. - You will say what I told you to. - Yes. And listen. I will be standing ahead of you. I will be standing afar and telling you.. When you have to smile, laugh and show your teeth. - And when you have to cry. Understood? - Yes. What I was saying was.. Okay. His maiesty.. His maiesty.. Listen, this is the chance to insult her. Come on. I apologize, we were late while arriving. Please have one.. Actually, Poonam is telling you, please take one. That's strange. You stayed in foreign countries all your life but.. The director told us to stay away from intoxication. The director.. The director? He was speaking about my father. His name was Sanchalak Singh. He used to travel with him in foreign countries. Please come, we shall have our dinner. Bring a large one for His Maiesty. Your Maiesty.. I am speaking to you. A special drink for you. Thank you. So, I was telling you.. 5th May always brings something in my life. Either something good, or something bad. - Like? - Like I was born on 5th May. It is so sad. It is so sad! And the day when I got the news.. Of winning the derby, the date was 5th May. I sympathise with you, princess, I really do. And my parents expired in the air crash on the 5th of May. Is it so? What letter? I didn't get any letter. Even if I did get it, I threw it in the rubbish bin.. Letter.. letter.. letter.. Your Maiesty.. Let it be morning. I will teach you such a lesson. You will never forget it throughout your life. The keys.. Stand straight. I will get the keys right away. "There was a male bird and a female bird." "There was a male bird and a female bird." "Both of them existed in the garden." "Didn't know why the bird used to shy like this." "What did he know.." Who is it? Who is it? His maiesty? Princess? You here? So late in the night? What will the people say? What are you doing here? This is my room! Go away from here. - This is your room? - Yes! - I thought that it was my room! - It's my room, go away! Thief, catch him! Catch him! Where is he? Where is he? The thief has run away. Why did he run away? Anyway, it doesn't matter. Go, and catch him. Bring him and tie him to the wall. I will shoot him! - It's surely that thief's.. - Yes, it must be the thief's.. But why will the thief steal removing his clothes? I am sorry. This suit doesn't belong to the thief. It belongs to his maiesty. He left it here in haste. Your gown. It doesn't matter. It does happen. Get up. Get up! Let me congratulate you! Get up! Get up! I just made you his Maiesty. But you turned out to be the best. You insulted the princess in such a way.. That she will keep weeping all through her life. I insulted her? - Did you forget it? You were in her bed yesterday. - Yes! And when I went to take your clothes.. And return her gown, please don't ask! She was in a proper state due to embarrassment. It seems that she hasn't come for her morning walk in the garden. She isn't to be seen anywhere, not by a yard. Hey, who is this? Is it the princess? It is not your princess, it my heart's princess. That same face, that same height. That twirling movement, which I searched for in Bangkok and Hong Kong.. Here, take this and you look too. I insulted the princess? I did? Princess, I am very sorry about yesterday night's incident. I don't want to hear anything about yesterday night. What is it? Ask me what it isn't. The king of Chandinagar is standing in your presence. My bud of Kashmir! My sweet! I will sacrifice the wealth of the world to you. I will make myself a garland around your neck. Keep your hands to yourself or I will slap you. Oh! What about a slap, my beloved? My Kashmiri carpet.. Even if you take my heart away, I won't die. We lovers are immortal! Get aside. If my father knows this, he will kill you. Father, do you mean my to be father-in-law.. I am telling you, it is better if you go away now. Otherwise my father.. Father! Is your father some God of death? What did you say? Please listen. Please.. I don't want to hear anything. Just look at me once. You will see what an honest man I am. I understood your sincerity last night. Please forget yesterday night, princess. For yesterday night's meeting, for everything. "For yesterday night's meeting, for everything." "Please forgive me." "Please forgive me." "For yesterday night's meeting, for everything." "Please forgive me." "Please forgive me." "Don't look at the mirror, look at my face." "See my simple character and form." "Am I not a honest and sincere man?" "Am I not praiseworthy?" "You give me iustice now!" "You give me iustice now!" "Please forgive me." "Please forgive me." "How can I dare to touch you?" "How can I take your name?" "That moth, happy go lucky person was someone else." "Please accept this clean hearted one." "Please listen to me, this is my first mistake." "Please forgive me." "Please forgive me." "It is accepted that the first mistake is always forgiven." "If you won't be merciful on me.." "The world will call you heartless and a torturer." "What else should I say? Please forgive me." "What else should I say? Please forgive me." "Please forgive me." "Please forgive me." "For yesterday night's meeting, for everything." "Please forgive me." "Please forgive me." Why not? Why can't you insult her? When a person loves someone.. - He respects her, he doesn't insult her. - What? I think that I fell in love with her.. When I saw her for the first time. Your maiesty, I am grateful to you. You may even kill me if you so wish. But please don't ell me to say anything against the princess. I won't be able to do that. I won't be able to hurt her. You have taught me to smile. You think that I like seeing tears in your eyes? No. I promise you, Poonam will be yours. But.. She is a princess.. And I am an orphan. If love can be weighed against gold and silver.. Would that be termed as love? Listen.. The princess hasn't forgiven you till now, isn't it? No. But she has invited the Kunwar for the party tonight. Doesn't matter. Do as I tell you. You'll see.. Not the Kunwar, but his Maiesty.. Will be with Poonam at tonight's party. Move, come on, come. Think that I have won half the battle. The rest of war, I will win at tonight's party. But sir, I think that she is fooling both of you. What? I mean that she is trying to fool the two of you. She loves me.. See? It's her call already. May God be merciful, Sir, I am His majesty here. Yes, tell me. - That ADC of mine.. - Yes? He has left my employ and ran away. If he does come to you, don't believe in anything that he says. No, I won't speak to him. - His ADC ran away from him. - Why? He must not have paid him, don't talk rubbish. That King isn't like me, who can't pay his ADC. Right. Surely, there is something else. May God be merciful. Oh. - Oh sir, this worthless man has a request. - Tell me. Please keep me as your ADC. Please keep as an ADC to your ADC. Tell me.. Why did the king remove you? He didn't remove me, I resigned myself. He wishes me to be a wall between you and the princess. - A wall? - Yes. The princess that she has seen the Chinese from China. The Japanese from Japan and the Africans from Africa. She even saw the English from England. But she never saw a braver and younger man than you. Her maiesty, when you dislike the Kunwar.. Why did you invite him to the party tonight? So that his maiesty gets jealous and goes away. Why don't you tell him everything clearly? If I do tell him everything clearly.. - Uncle will kill me. Understood? - Yes. Her maiesty.. Tell me? The person who apologizes after committing a mistake. He is considered to be a great man. But the man who forgives him is considered greater. If you accept these flowers, I'll think that you forgave me. Why don't you people have a seat? Please come.. And the princess further says that.. Eating home cooked rural food.. You have such a glow on your face.. She is burning due to that glow. But I have never eaten whatever you just said. Your father must surely have eaten it. I have seen it with my own eyes. But what does this king want from you? He wants me to separate the two of you? Yes. And do you know? He has arranged for a fancy dress show in.. The party tonight. He has called everyone in it. - Except you. - I don't have time. - I am going to the party tonight. - I know that, sir. But the show is before the party. And the princess is invited in that too. And do you know further? This is the king's trick. I understood. Please have it. That's what I had come to tell you. The princess is going there as Princess Subhadra. If you listen to me, become Arjun and reach her room. And just like Ariun had eloped with Subhadra. You elope with Poonam too. And I can tell you surely, you will.. Get the first, second and third and the last prize. But where will I get Arjun's uniform? Uniform? There is no dearth of uniforms in this cold. There are so many iobless drama companies. You dial just one number. You will get the uniforms of the whole Mahabharata. I will dial it right away now.. You are such a good man.. The soul.. I forgot to place my hand on myheart. My soul is yearning. Subhadra, the heart is not at peace. Come beloved, let us go where there is privacy. What insolence is this? I knew that my Subhadra will be shy of people.. And society, she'll be scared and not come to me. But I will take her on my shoulders. Don't call me Kunwar, call me the son of Kunti, Arjun. Please go away. No! Not liquor, the elixir of gods! I haven't seen an insolent or shameless man than you. But all this was done by his Majesty's ADC. I had told you not to pay attention to anything he says. Where is he? Where is he? Where are you running? You sinner, wretch! You fooled Arjun! He will show you the mace now! Be ware! The arrow from Ariun's bow is released. Where are you running? Save me! Are you inside? Come on! Come out! - Remove the wretch out, or else I will force you! - What? You haven't seen Ariun's mace! And you haven't seen my axe! No axe works in front of Arjun's mace. Iniustice! Iniustice! You were to go to the partyy. Not were, I am, going. Come on, your maiesty. Your maiesty.. Were you dreaming? - Can I ask you something? - Please do. Did you see dreams too, ever? Yes, I did. In my childhood. Were they fulfilled? Dreams are that which can never be reality. Your maiesty.. Yes. Did the Kunwar go? Yes. He drank one and a half bottle of scotch. He broke the outside window, broke a waiter's head. And then left Kashmir. I am free of one now. Let me see.. But what should I do of his majesty? I will have to think something to drive him away. You won't have to think something to drive me away. - Your maiesty.. - You were right. Dreams never turn into reality. Then, how could my dream turn into reality? If I did commit any mistake knowingly or.. Unknowingly please forgive me for that. The person who apologizes after committing a mistake.. He is thought to be a great man. But the man who forgives him is thought to be greater. You were right. Dreams are never turned into reality. Then, how can my dreams come true? If I committed any mistake knowingly.. Or unknowingly, please forgive me for that. I will push, you start the car. Maybe, it will get out. I am sorry for yesterday night's incident. I thought about it all through the night. Yes, even I couldn't sleep at night. I'd made a call to your place in the morning too. Yes, it was me who received it. But, I was told that you were sleeping. Yes.. Yes. I was sleeping at that time. I am awake now. Take God's name and turn the key. The car will clear in one single thrust. Are you hurt? I am all right, princess. You were being so careful of it. And it splattered all over you in the end. - Who? - The muck. What will happen now? What will happen. The one who made the muck has made water to wash it to. I will just make you dip once and everything will be all right. Please come. The water is too cold. If I take a dip I will have pneumonia. See. The one who made the water made the fire too. We will sit in it's presence for some time, all will be all right. - No! - See, do what I did. Do what I did now, come on. - Your maiesty.. - Yes? Please say something. What can I tell. You are the one feeling the chill.. And you have given me the blanket. - Here, please take this blanket. - No! I am not that selfish. Then take half of it. How can I do that? Come here, please. Here.. Not here, here.. I feel how selfish I have been.. You? No, not at all. You were cold, isn't it? You were feeling cold too. But I think that I thought only about myself before this. But you.. But I will remember today, forever. What all has happened this day. Your car sticking in the mud, my pushing it. The car moving out, my falling in the muck. You supporting me. Dipping in the cold water. Sitting in the embrace of the warm fire. Hiding from each other and yet, so close. Do you know why all this happened today? Why? Because today is 5th May. And this day brings either good or bad in your life. "My beloved." "From today, I name you this." "My love.. my love.. my beloved, my beloved." "From today, I name you this." "You gave me a message of love under this pretext." "My love.. my love.. my beloved, my beloved." "Give me an answer of my message." "Why are you so silent?'" "Why are you so silent?'" "I am shying today. While telling you something." "I gave my eyes the task of my lips." "You gave me a message of love under this pretext." "My love.. my love.. my beloved, my beloved." "While speaking, you have started to love me too." "You have stolen my sleep and peace." "And you are accusing me silently." "You gave me a message of love under this pretext." "My love.. my love.. my beloved, my beloved." "You made every ambition of this heart restless." "Don't say this, say, every story of this heart." "It gave a beautiful result to this love." "You gave me a message of love under this pretext." - "My love.. my love.. - My beloved, my beloved." "My love.. my love.. my beloved, my beloved." Slowly, if father hears it.. Why, is your father cooking food inside? No. He is cutting wood over there. Let him cut the wood, I will cut him too. How did you come to know my name? I asked your name everywhere. I searched for you everywhere. I risked my life and came from the Hotel Oberoi. I will make you my queen today. - Sir, can I ask you something? - Ask. Are you really a King? - Do I seem to be.. - Slowly.. You don't believe me? Come with me. I will show you who I am. Come on. Tell me. - Won't you be my queen Victoria? - What? - Won't you be the queen of my Chandipur? - Yes. Won't you be the mother of my children? Yes. You are my cuckoo. You are the first girl who said yes and yes. No! No! Hey, what kind of a girl are you? You say yes and then you say no. Did you see some wild hog? You pig! Where are you going?! Please, please sit down. We will sit there. Your maiesty.. Please don't call me by that name. But I don't like this Pratap Singh name. Even I don't like it. Then, what should I address you as? Okay, Mr. Raju. Please tell me something about kingdom. - My kingdom? - Yes. Chandipur. Tell me, what must be the population there? It must be something like the whole of India. It shouldn't have been that much. I was thinking that I'd visit there some day. How must be the weather there now? - The weather? - It will not be better than Kashmir. I mean, we will have to wait here. Come on, let us go to the temple. Do you want me not to come to your kingdom? - No, it is nothing like that. - Then, what is it? Tell me the truth, what is the matter? Why don't you tell me? Please tell me. Truth is beautiful! Truth is beautiful! It is good that you awoke. Yes, but I was late in getting up. I thought about visiting the Dal lake tonight. I wish to tell you something. It seems that I wish to tell you something too. Please come then.. Your maiesty, why are you so silent? Because I awoke you from sleep? No. That was very good. Why are you so glum then? You should be happy today too. Why? What is so special today? Not today. Uncle is coming tomorrow. Do you know? When I told him about you over.. The trunk call he was very happy. What did you tell him about me? I told him that I liked my Majesty a lot. When I have awakened.. - Should I ask you something? - Please do. - If I weren't a king.. - Why would you not be one? No.. Think that I would be a poor farmer a normal clerk.. Or an orphan, would you talk about me to your uncle? Because then, the two of us would never have met. And if.. I remembered something. On uncle's saying, we had gone to an orphanage once. An orphan had hugged me there. I felt like having him shot down. What's funnier is that, he looks similar to you. But so what if he looked similar? A person should be worth something to fall in love. - Isn't it? - Yes. But please tell me. What if that orphan would fall in love with you? Maybe, he would be forced to commit suicide. You know.. You know that a man can't exist only on love. Respect, dignity and wealth, even that is needed, isn't it? I think you are right. But how are we concerned with all this? How are we concerned with all this? Your Maiesty.. Uncle.. His Maiesty.. If you are the king, who was he? He was an orphan, but he dreamt of being a king. I took advantage of this madness. And I brought him here, so that I.. Could avenge the insult that you gave me in that letter. But.. He couldn't insult you. Because he fell in love with you. But.. but why did he leave? Because he was afraid that after you.. Know the truth, he would fall in his own eyes.. After looking at the hatred for him in your eyes. Before leaving, he told me to tell the princess.. That he was the same orphan who'd embraced her once.. And you'd felt like shooting him down. He was a conman and in disguise. He wanted to achieve happiness y fooling others. But, when he found out about uncle arriving.. He thought that leaving was the best. He wanted you to hate him and forget him forever. But.. The truth is.. His only fault is that he was an orphan.. And he fell in love with a princess. Whether you can forget him or not.. But please forgive him for certain. "The happiness blooms in the garden of luck."

Without you, o beloved! My eyes have started yearning. They have started shedding tears in your loss. My eyes have started yearning. They have started shedding tears in your loss. They cry all through the night, they cry with me. Every flower, every path, every house. O beloved! Without you, o beloved! My heart burns, it misses you. Every flower, every path, every house. O beloved! Without you, o beloved! The shadows of your memories are scattered. The clouds of your dreams are being settled. The shadows of your memories are scattered. The clouds of your dreams are being settled. Where should I go, me the crazy girl? Everywhere, people are talking about you. O beloved! Without you, o beloved! My heart burns, it misses you. Every flower, every path, every house. O beloved! Without you, o beloved! I won't come, you came to know that. I won't leave this whole world. I won't come, you came to know that. I won't leave this whole world. You didn't see me and call me. I would have walked away to you, kicking. Every flower, every path, every house. O beloved! Without you, o beloved! My heart burns, it misses you. Every flower, every path, every house. O beloved! Without you, o beloved! I was told over the trunk call that.. She wanted to marry you, and you wanted to marry her. But what do I see when I come here? She is lying in her room crying. You are drinking beer here. What is the matter after all? Uncle.. This isn't iowar and neither jowar pancake. This is called as romance, or love. You didn't understand? You didn't understand? What madness is this? Listen to me, uncle.. Where are you going o mustached uncle? Sing, dance and have fun. Move away, you insolent crazy donkey. What will the world say if they see? They will say that you son-in-law loves you. What a way His Maiesty found out to clear himself from his path. Princess, are you still thinking about that crazy man? Whether she is thinking of that crazy man or not.. But I won't allow this marriage to take place. Not only is he insolent and stupid, he is crazy too. He pressed his cigarette in my breakfast omelet. I thought that it must have been his mistake. But today, he started playing with my moustaches. And he put his arm over my waist and.. Started dancing like I was a sixteen year old girl. You simple and cute mustached uncle! No! Never! This mad man will never become my son-in-law. - Did you hear that, Poonam? - Yes. Your maiesty, till when you search for that crazy man? Till the time I don't meet him. Bring two bread and butter. Bring to hard bread and butter. Fry sir's heart. Two coco colas, quickly, give water there. Here you are. Quickly, very good. Sir, your tea? What are you doing? I had vowed to Sai Baba that the.. Day you work for a whole week.. I will put one and a quarter rupee on your head. You are taking vows and I'm thinking.. Of leaving my iob and going somewhere. That same talk again. If you don't work, where you eat and drink from? How will you survive? Who wants to survive? What is such a great apocalypse? If you'd ever be kicked in love, you'd understand. Now, for me, eating, drinking, sleeping, waking and living. All of it is useless now. I don't understand what I should do now. Should I tell you? You go back. She is a princess, it won't be difficult to search for her. It won't be difficult to find her. But with what face should I go? She must hate even my name now. But it's possible that hearing your problem she must.. Be yearning for you. And as soon as she sees you.. She marries you and makes you a king of her kingdom. I became a king and saw it once. I don't have an ambition to become it once again. Yes, if she was a commoner and.. She'd make me the king of her heat, I swear.. But the truth is that.. That neither is she a commoner and nor.. Do I want to become a king due to someone's alms. Hot water. Hot water. - Should I bring cold water? - I don't want anything. I should leave all these perks and.. - Practice living like a commoner. - But why? Because the person with whom.. I want to spend my life with is a commoner. What? I thought that it was a joke and it was over. This ioke will end with the end of life now. You forgot the challan here. - Who is it? - The gas man. You came so late. - Where do I have to make the connection? - Inside. Hey, have you come for the connection or to stare at girls? Connect it and go. Princess.. I am not a princess. Then how did you recognize me? I am Poonam, who met you in Kashmir. But.. But Poonam and the princess are one and the same. No, I am not a princess. Just like you were sent as a king there.. Just like that I was sent there as a princess. But.. Poonam's eyes were blue, that's it, isn't it? See. These are the contact lenses which.. I wore to become the princess. Please believe me, Raju. Just like you, even my life was played with.. Taking advantage of my poverty. I was made a princess for a few days and was told to fake a drama. But that drama and the game became bondage. I fell in love with you, Raju. And I couldn't tell you the truth. Because I was afraid that you shouldn't hate me. Don't suspect me like this, Raju. Even you'd lied to me. You met me as a king. Your faked your false love. You promised me life together. But before I could tell you everything.. You disappeared all of a sudden. You didn't even turn back once and see. Those promises just went on as talks. And me.. I had gone crazy. I searched around everywhere in Bombay. But I couldn't find you. And when I met you, your eyes are accusing me. Won't you forget me for this.. Small lie and this drama? There isn't anything to forgive in this. The both of us are equally guilty for whatever happened. We both are equally at fault But what occurred, if it hadn't.. The two of us wouldn't have met like this. There isn't any wall between us today. I am a common man and you are my common queen. "You are the peacock of the jungle I am.." "The peacock of the garden, we play hide and seek." "Come, we will talk a bit." "We will talk and we will meet." "My name is Chandni, your name is Chakor.." "And playing hide and seek." "Playing hide and seek, we will talk a bit." "We stay in the Love land." "How are we connected to this world?'" "I am the wild cloud." "You are the nice breeze." "Subtly, you say these legends of love." "Like the flowers of spring speak to the cuckoo." "If someone hears it, there will be a hullabaloo." "I will settler in your hair." "Breaking all the bondages." "I will settle in your eyes leaving the whole world." "If this breath stops." "If this breath stops, this love shouldn't stop." Bring two breads and butter. Bring two coca - colas. Fry sir's brain here. Why do these people put their fingers in the water? Because the tea is very hot. If they put their fingers.. In the tea, they will burn their fingers. I meant to say.. Why are these people so unhygienic? See. This cup is broken. There can be germs in it too. Why? Have you become a princess again? I didn't become one. But I have acted as one for so many days, isn't it? It is better if you forget it as soon as possible. - Otherwise, if you come to my house and.. - Your house? That will be done too. Poonam, I was thinking.. To make a small house quickly. In which you and I stay together forever and ever. You are thinking where will I get money.. From to make a house from, isn't it? - No. - Liar! Crazy girl. Your Raju maybe poor and illiterate. But he certainly knows that a house is needed to marry. And to make a house, money is needed. And to make money, a iob is needed. I have decided to work in three places from tomorrow. - Three places? - Yes, in the day, night and.. - Amrapali. - So when will you meet me? - In the middle. - What must be the time now? - Whatever was yesterday. I think that I am late. Therefore I am thinking of making a house. There shouldn't be any time problem or any darkness. "We will make a beautiful boat house." "In which, our family will stay!" "A family.." Another small flower for you. Yes? Will you father chase us even after marriage? I mean, will he stay with us forcibly? You have spoken to my father about marriage, isn't it? That's it. We can't talk anything. My tongue wavers when I go to your father. - Not only tongue.. - Who is it? Looking at me, your body shakes and trembles. - What can I do? You look like that. - What did you say? See, if you wish to marry my daughter.. You will have to be strong like me. I am very strong from inside. I seem to be like this to you from the outside. But I want someone same outside and.. Inside for my daughter, understood? Your stance should be like iron. Your chest should be like a mace. Understood? - Yes. I did! I will try to be strong! Strong! - Very good. Forty four.. forty five.. very good. Forty six.. forty seven.. Wow.. forty eight! Forty nine.. sixty.. - Seventy.. eighty.. - Wait. You are doing some mistake. There is no mistake, father-in-law, you see. See - Ninety. - Ninety. - Hundred. - Hundred. One hundred and ten. One hundred and twenty. You con man. What are you doing? - You are doing something wrong in the counting. - Why? You are counting everything wrong. - It will be done again. - What will be done again? - You will have to exercise again. - Again? - Yes. - But where has he gone? - To earn money. - He has to make a house, isn't it? - May such a house burn! He works all through the day. What if something happens to him? - Someone called Raju.. - What happened to Raju? See there. - What happened to him? - Doctor said that he needs some sleep. Okay, thank you for bringing him here. Raju, get up. How long will you sleep now? - What must be the time now? - Whatever it was yesterday at this time. - Then I should go to work. - You aren't working today. I don't have to go to work, I have to see the flat. The flat won't run away. Take it tomorrow. No! I have go to Shivdasani, the house agent to see the flat. Look at this. Look at this. - I have brought so much money. - So much money? - Where did you get them from? - Yes, come on. Sir, did you see the sitting room there? This is the bedroom. - Can we not sleep here? - It is a big room. It is 15 by 12 - What is it of? Raju, don't ioke. Please come, come. And see this. Sir, look at this. This is the bathroom. The water is for twenty four hours, isn't it? Twenty four hours. Raju! I am sorry. I thought that this was for some fountain. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Please come, sister. - I am wet. - What you are wet? - Sir, you are taking the flat for yourself, isn't it? - Yes. - Do you like the house? - It is good. - It is good. What will be the rent? It is no big deal. Three months advance rent, one month running. And commission for two months. All in all one thousand seven hundred and ninety rupees. And you must know the 'turban' charges too. But I didn't come here to take any 'turbans'. I came here to take flats. One doesn't have to take, but give turbans in Bombay. The rate is sixteen thousand rupees. All in one seventeen thousand, seven hundred and ninety rupees. Sir, this isn't the bedroom. - Three hundred and eighty rupees. - Bring it. Three hundred and eighty and this. All in all, one thousand, two hundred and seventy. But one needs sixteen thousand.. Seven hundred and ninety rupees. I have an idea. There is an old woman staying next to it. She has a room empty there. I will tell her, that the two of you wish to make a room there. - Room? - Room.. A hut. You call it a bungalow if you wish. Come on, I'll show you. - Father.. O father.. - Yes? Please accept this proposal. He loves me a lot. I love him too. I wish him to marry you. But I want him to be strong. I told him to carry the wood. He said that he couldn't. You are a strange man. What is the connection to the wood to our marriage? What can I tell you now? There is a deep connection. The person who can't carry the wood.. How will he carry my daughter? - He will carry it. - What happened to your voice? Father, see behind. I will carry the wood as well as your daughter. - The wood? - Father! Hey, he was here, where did he run away? Hey! You kept the wood by the tree! Uncle.. Hey, girl! Hey, girl. - I am calling you. - But why? - Who are you? - Why do you want to know? - Will you come with me? - Aren't you ashamed? You must be having a daughter of my age. And he has come to take me away. Listen, daughter. You are wrong. I don't have a daughter of your age, but a grand daughter. Come with me. I wish to see the two of you together. No! Didn't I tell you? I won't come with you. What will the other people say if I go in such a huge car? Okay, listen. I will bring a taxi for you. Whether you bring a taxi or a cycle, I won't come with you. Okay, show me your house. I will bring my grand daughter here. - Okay, I will come with you. - Very good. Come on. - Sit down. Not here. - Okay. - What is your name? - Jayshree. - Is Malti the name of the prince? - No. Come here. - Even you were surprised, isn't it? - Yes. This isn't Poonam, this is Jayshree. Even I was thinking how could that be possible? There is a princess upstairs and downstairs too. - Do the two of us look so similar? - Yes. Go, go and bring the princess downstairs. - Where is Poonam? - She is in her room. Go and bring her downstairs. Wait, I will come there too. Stay here till I come back. - If you say, I will stay here forever. - Okay. What? I will think about that later. Where is Poonam? She is having her bath, Your Highness. But the door is open. What about the door? I will close it. But there isn't any noise from inside. I can hear the sound. The princess is singing beneath the shower. - She is singing and only you can hear it? - Yes. What has happened to you, uncle? You could have knocked. You could have called me. I thought that you weren't downstairs. Anyway, that girl who resembles you has come. Okay, you go downstairs. I will dress up and come. - What will happen now? - You don't worry. Princess, your eyes.. Where is the girl? Sir, she is outside. Didn't you stop her? I stopped her a lot, but she didn't listen. Why didn't you follow her? My father told me when I was a child.. That honest boys like me don't chase girls. Can I take this flower? Yes, take it. But go inside now. Sir, it is Kunwar's call. Okay, Kunwar's call. - The princess has called her upstairs. - Okay. Okay, I will come upstairs too. Please come. You go to Vile Parle right now. Raju must have come there. - I didn't tell him before coming here. - But uncle.. Don't worry about him. I will change my clothes.. And tell him that the girl met me and left. Where did that girl go? She met me and went away. You were right. She actually looks like me. I wanted to see the two of you together. Therefore I brought her here, and you didn't stop her? Meet her some day later. Malti has gone to leave her. She will see where she lives. Can I go now? - I have a Social welfare Organization meeting. - Go. Did you see any girl go with Malti? No, sir. Malti went alone from here. It's good that uncle didn't know about this. But for how long will you hide this from him? I am thinking till when will I hide it from Raju? I will have to tell him some day or the other. That I am the princess. Are you ready to marry her even after knowing all this? Everyone does such mistakes in youth. Then, there is only one way out. Poonam shouldn't find out that we know about her. Before any negative word comes out of her lips.. I will fix her marriage proposal with you. You are right, uncle. Yes? - Set this somewhere. - Just a minute. Two bodies and one soul, Like you and I. Isn't it, Poonam? What happened? - See, look at this. - So what? It was made of clay. We will get a new one. Come with me. I will show you something. Look at this. - But these are flowers of plastic. - They are beautiful, isn't it? But they are fake. Poonam, there.. Is no need of any falsehood in this house. The base of this house has been put on love and truth. And these things are the pride of this house. And beauty. Do you remember, Poonam? I was scared of listening the 'Truth is beautiful'.. Hymn in Kashmir once. But today.. I am seeing you as the form of hymn in front of me. And I.. What happened to you? Nothing. I am late. I have to go now. The house is ready now. Why don't you come here to stay? Women don't stay in the to be husband's house before marriage. So what are we waiting for? There is a temple nearby. - We will go and marry there right away. - Not today. - Tomorrow? - Not tomorrow too. - Then surely, day after tomorrow. The sun will rise there and I will mount the horse. - Okay, I will go now. - No, wait. I will come too. Why? Why don't you stay here? No, Poonam. A house is made by a housewife. This house will settle when you come here as a housewife. You will surely have to come to my marriage party. I promise you, I will surely come to your marriage reception. Poor people just have a marriage, no receptions. That is just Raju.. So do you think that I'll stay a princess, marrying a poor man? Then? After marriage, just like how all girls.. Leave their parent's house and go.. To their in-law's house like that, I will go too. We have made a small house too. Then, call him tonight too. No, I can't call him. He doesn't know that I am a princess till now. But till when will you hide this from him? After tonight's party. I will speak to uncle. I don't want this kingdom, money or wealth. And then.. I will really become a common woman and go to my Raju. May God keep you two happy. But be sure to come to my party tonight. Yes, I will surely come. Yes, Mr. D'Mello told me that tonight.. There is a party of Mr. D'Mello's wedding. Were you not invited? No, but I will surely go. To congratulate him. Excuse me. Could you tell me where Poonam lives? - Poonam? - Yes, the one who lives here. Oh! Those artistes! They don't live here. They come here for an hour. They don't live here, just come here? Then they go too. One comes in a shiny and gaudy saree and blue eyes. And goes in a cheap saree and black eyes. And another comes in young, and goes out old. When all of you are present here. Who have our and the princess's.. Happiness close to their heart. I wish to give you this good news. I wish to announce the engagement.. Of my grand daughter, Princess Poonam and the Prince Bhadrasing Your maiesty.. Congratulations on your engagement. May God keep the house rich and.. Prosperous in which you go as a bride. I didn't know.. Or else I would have brought a few flowers for you. You didn't get flowers? It doesn't matter. Just sing us a song as blossoming like the flowers. You sing very well, your maiesty. His maiesty was a dream, which was broken. But, if the kings and queens are happy.. By ioking about Raju's feelings, Raju will sing. On this auspicious occasion, our special.. Guest, Raia will sing you a song of happiness. "The people who have thorns in their fate." "Shouldn't dream about flower buds." "Buds are the glory of palaces and.." "Thorns are the glory of the traveling paths." "Raju had a dream, Raju the king, the emperor." "I didn't have a kingdom or a crown." "But even then, I was a king." "I was immature and illiterate." "I saw faces, but I didn't see.." ♪ "But I didn't see the disguises of disloyalty." "I wouldn't be able to touch even the dirt at her feet." "Why did I love her? I am just a single flower." "I am just a single flower, she was a rose of the spring." "Congratulations to you, procession come to your house." "I talked about sadness by mistake." "I talked about sadness, please forgive me." From where have to learnt to walk.. Away from the guests and of respected houses? Don't you think anything about their respect? I think about your respect with their respect too. Therefore I came away from there silently. Otherwise, how you announced something.. Without asking me, even I would announce something. I don't accept this engagement. - It is against my wishes. - This is my decision. And you know that my decisions don't change. Then how did you change your decision.. - About my marriage to Raia? - He wasn't worth it. And what do you think? Is this Kunwar worth it? He knows that I love Raju. He wishes to marry me.. Just because I am the heir to this kingdom. But listen to this. I don't have any relation to that kingdom, will and wealth. Do you know what you are saying? I am talking about leaving the love and wealth.. Of my house and going to my in-law's house. In-law's house? Can that orphan's house be your in-law's house? I and Raju have made that house. Truth is it's base. Love are it's walls. Sacrifice for each other is it's roof. And peace of mind is it's decoration. You tell me now. If that house is not worthy to be my in-law's place.. Is his house worthy of being one? He doesn't await me, he awaits my wealth. Wealth goes to the rich people. And princesses marry kings. Just like kings and queens are history now.. Just like that, these status things are just antique. Just like the kings of yesterday can't order anyone.. Just like that, today, every man is king of his heart. I am not trying to explain it to you as a king.. But as an old father at this time. If a father doesn't order his daughter.. And tries to fill happiness in her life.. The father's dignity doesn't fall low in that. You aren't grandpa's grand daughter. You are my fiancé too. - Let go of my hand. - Never. Wait.. - Princess. What are you doing? - I told you. This ioke will end with the end of life now. - Princess.. - Malti.. - You can't do this. - Go away from here, your highness. - No! - For God's sake, go away from here. No, you can't burn this house. I have left everything I had for it. You wish to make lies into truth again? I hate everything that is lies. I hate this house, this relation, this Raju. Who forgot himself in search of happiness. And he became something else. Today, let Raju and his ambitions burn to ashes! No. This is my house! This is my Raju! Raju and me had the same ambition. No, Raju was orphan and alone. He didn't have any happiness, love or any house. You have a house, you have a fiancé. Raju, please try to understand. Tonight's party, and your arrival all of a sudden. It played with my life. The dreams which I was trying to save.. The love for which I was ready to lie too.. That was wiped within a moment. You said everything without listening to me. And before I could speak, you said everything. Raju, look into my heart. It isn't a Princess's heart. It is a human's and a woman's. You want fake, princess. Please go away from here. No! I have wiped every fake thing of the princess. Just thinking that this house will be my life. A house belongs to a woman. And you don't have any right to blot this house as fake. - This house's base was kept on lies. - No! This house is my truth. This is my support. I will burn to ashes with my husband any my house. This is my fire test now. Let me burn into ashes. - Your highness.. - Call me Poonam.. Just Poonam. I am your's. Just your's. I am the truth of your love. I am the decoration of your house. Believe me, please believe me. Poonam.. Poonam.. Poonam.. Believe me, Raju.. - Poonam.. - Raju. Are you hurt? Are you all right? I lost to you two. Now, please come with me. No. We will settle our house here now. But, your kingdom and your wealth.. Distribute it amongst the orphans. I have got a huge wealth here. Come on, Raju. We will save our house. Come on. "The thread of breaths may break." "He thread of love won't break." "Come on, we will hide and speak a bit about love." "We will speak about love. We will meet each other." "I am the peacock of the iungle, you are the peahen." "Come, on, we will hide and talk about love."
