You were great in there, really great. Thank you. Uh, you on your way now? Yeah, back to the city. You don't like it? No, it's a pressure cooker. I might be up there next season. If I get drafted by the Leafs. What's that face for? It was just the way you said that. Like you, you make it sound like it was the army or something. You know like, like you had no choice. Well, if it's the army, it's gotta be the best paid one in the world. Yeah, but how much can you pay for someone's life? Hey... She for real? Yeah. I don't think we need him that much. In that case, gentlemen, we're only wasting our time, until you set up a deal with somebody who does. Uh, Joe. I can sympathize with Freddy's position. Well, so can I. Last place, two years in a row. I'm not sure we need him $120,000 worth. Can I quote you? You sure can. The three-time winner, the junior scoring championship. 53 goals last year, and he can't help you? I wouldn't blame the fans for thinking you're just trying to save money at their expense. Get out of here. I'll tell you what. Let me go over it with Freddy again, see what we can come up with. Well, look at it this way, Graydon, you're making a small down payment on a million dollar property. Yes, or I could be laying out a hell of a lot for a nine day wonder. He'll earn his keep. That's what we have to decide. I'll expect your call. Bastard! He's got us cold and he knows it. Tell me something, Freddy. Is that kid as good as the papers say? It's too soon to tell yet. I don't have any more time. If I'm going to put out $120,000 for a two year contract, I wanna know. I drafted him because I thought he could help us. I still do. Okay. But, Freddy, let's hope you're right. [general conversations] You must be asking a hell of a lot, Graydon, if you haven't come to terms with him this late in the game. All these things take time, you know, Greg. And, after all, he was the Leaf's top draft choice. You've got MacMillian negotiating for you, right? You know, ever since that son of a bitch stuck his nose in the game, you'd think every kid from the bush was worth a million bucks. Oh, they do cost a whole lot more than they used to. But, so does everything else, Mr. Walsh. Listen, kid, I've known all the great ones. The Charlie Conachers, the Busher Jacksons, some of them personal friends. Now, I doubt if any one of those ever saw more than 5,000 bucks during a whole season. And you maybe worth all this money you're going after, but you're gonna have to play a hell of a lot of hockey to convince me. I'll wait and read it in your column. You know, if your boy is only half as good with his stick as he is with his mouth, he's gonna win the Stanley Cup for you single-handed. Now, remember, you said that, Mr. Walsh, I didn't. Yeah. Let's see what we can do about that empty glass of yours, Greg. I'm sorry. It's all right. Did I hurt you? Do you have a handkerchief or something? Yeah, right here. Thank you. Uh, can I get you another one? Yes, please. What was it? Scotch, double. Ice, no water. I'll be right back. Okay, Billy, I'll handle it. Sure, Coach. Hello, darling. I'm having a lovely time. Yes, you are, aren't you? Listen, I've gotta leave with Hunter afterwards. I'll get you a cab. Of course, Freddy. But, uh, couldn't I pay my respects to all these nice people? Come on. It's so seldom I get a chance to meet... [whistle blowing] [Freddy] Cover your man in front. Pass the puck. Come on, pass it! In the slot, in the slot, come on, come on! Dig, dig, dig! Skate, skate!

[whistle blowing] All right. That's it for today. You all right, Chief? Somebody ought to tell that new kid this is a training camp for hockey players, not guerrilla fighters. He's got guts. He's great, so long as you're not in line. Chief, you all right? Yeah, I'll be okay. Can I buy you a beer? Sure, come on, let's go. Also, you gotta remember, Billy, that you represent every kid that ever laced on a pair of skates. There isn't one of them that wouldn't give his eye teeth to be in your position. And that can be a pretty big load. Yeah. Anyways, we didn't come here for me to bend your ear and give you advice. Now, listen, I, I really appreciate it, Chief. I don't know, I, I just feel... Scared? You'd be dumb, real dumb, if you weren't scared. Everybody's scared when they start. [waiter] Care for any more, gentlemen? Yeah. [Chief] No, no, not for me, thank you. I promised I'd take my boy to football practice, and I'm late already. How's it going, Chief? Pretty good, old timer. Gonna take Boston this year? You got a house, bet it on us. That guy with you, is he gonna be any help? Him? I doubt it. I just got him along to carry my skates. [laughing] Love to have a beer with you, old-timer, but I just found out they don't serve Indians here, so have one on me, will ya? God bless you, Army. I hope you have a 50 goal season. 20 goals will do me, old timer. If I scored 50 this year, they'd want me to score 50 again next year. [man laughing] [Billy] Who's that?

I came by because I was afraid you'd be worried if you phoned the house and got no answer. Good night, Freddy, I won't wait up. Good night, Grace. [cheering on TV] Joe, take, take her back just to... [tape rewinding] Yeah, to that. [commentary resumes] ♪♪ [general conversations] Wow! Thank you very much. [Sherri] Oh, Billy. Didn't I tell you she was great? You'd better believe it. If I didn't know better, I'd swear you were having fun. Oh, I feel great, Billy, really. And there's nobody here but us, eh? Ahh, don't. [chuckling] ♪♪ Man the host cut in? I've got to-- he's got it written in my contract. Thank you. We haven't seen you before, have we? No. How long have you known Billy? I met Billy last Spring. Really? Mm-hmm. Well, what do you think? About what? About us. The hockey world. Well, it's different, you know. Different and very special, my dear. It's a brave group, and I don't just mean the lads. It takes a lot of courage to watch a man out there, night after night. Mm-hmm. I know the players get most of the glory, but I think that the women who wait at home for them at night deserve most of the credit. They must have to love the game as much as the man does. You understand what I mean, Sherri? Yeah, I think so. Would you excuse me for a minute? Surely. Hi, Coach. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, Billy. That's a nice looking girl. You don't miss much. I can't afford it. Hey, what are you drinking? I'll have a beer. Thanks. You serious about her, Billy? Are you going to get married? We're still young, there's lots of time. You know, Billy, decisions are the big hang-ups in life. The longer you put them off, the harder they come. You're never really free to pour yourself anywhere, as long as you let other things crowd you. Everything in life has to be put in its proper place. Even a wife. Something to think about. And don't just think about it... decide. It's all right, dear, I'll only be a moment. No, it's okay, there's no hurry. Having a good time? Mm-hmm. Everyone's very friendly. You're new, aren't you? Which one are you with? Oh, Billy Duke. Ooh. I'm Sherri Nelson. That explains it. Forgive me. People come and go so quickly, I have trouble keeping track. I hear he's very good. Yeah, I think so. Mmm, that always makes it harder. It's difficult enough, God knows, just trying to live some kind of life being ordinary. But when you're good, good enough to be worth a lot of money to someone... It doesn't have to be that way. Maybe not. But when you think of all the players who didn't want to be traded, the uh, coaches that had to be fired, the wives that had to pick up and move without any say, you have to wonder which counts most. People or the, uh... system. [overlapping conversations] [overlapping conversations] Sherri, what the hell happened? Enough, Billy! I just have to go, okay? You can't leave. What am I gonna say? I don't care what you say. Tell 'em I got hit by a bus or something. What's the matter with you? Hunter's my boss, you can't walk out on him. Look, Billy, he doesn't own me. I thought you were having fun. Oh, sure, turn up the record player. Go ahead, Billy, have another drink to the establishment. To the system, you know. You're out of your skull. Yeah, maybe, but it's my skull, okay? Hey, Billy, come on, join the party. There's a whole new year waiting. Wait-- they're waiting for the great Billy Duke-- come on! Sherri!

Come on, anything. Ask me later, Barney. I can't think now. [whistling] Hey, Billy. [whistling] The president just called the boss. You're out for five games and in for $1,000 fine. Five games? Doesn't he know there's only six left in the season? I don't know if anybody's pointed that out to him. And we need two wins to make the playoffs. And a tie. Look, I didn't see that linesman. You can look in the pictures. Everybody's seen the pictures, Billy, you still can't go around mugging the ref. They get very uptight at being battered about. He can't do that. You bet your sweet ass he can. You know something, Billy? I have a hunch we're gonna be a lot better off without you. Oh, we all know you're a fine hockey player, Billy. Read any sports page. We don't even mind the big cheers every time you step on the ice. That's part of the game, we like it. But, once in a while, Bill, we'd like to feel you need us. That's crazy! Is it? You never needed anybody in your life. [phone ringing, typewriters clicking] The file you asked for on the Nelson girl. Oh, thanks, Carol. Looks like I got a lot of reading to do, huh? Oh, I think you can skim most of it. It's just PR blurbs, you know, that kind of junk. Is there anything in her background? Not much. Apparently, her real name's Shirley, not Sherri Lee. There is a piece in there about the family. I gathered that the mother was an alcoholic, uh, divorced. Some kind of custody battle when the kid was 14. The father won, but Shirley kept running away and he finally got tired of having her hauled back all the time. The rest's pretty standard. Has she ever been busted? There is a news clip. Uh, apparently she was pinched for hassling the cops, some kind of sit-in. There's another one as well on her being picked up, uh, there it is, for possession of narcotics. But, apparently, there were no convictions. Just your your average, typical, fun-loving pussycat, eh? Well, I have seen better material for a sports feature. Maybe. Um, don't forget where you got that, eh? Oh, would I dare? ♪♪ [dog barking] [Billy whistling] Tipu, come on. [barking] Come on, Tipu. Come on. Stay... stay. You really wanna go, Sherri? I don't have much choice, right? Look, forget that lousy story. It's what you wanna do that's important. Okay, I'll do whatever you want. Well, I mean, when we get to see the guys again. Sid's there, and maybe you'll feel like working, you know. Yeah, okay. "And so, as the Leafs hit the wires tomorrow night, "they find themselves desperately needing a win. "Win or lose, one can't help thinking how much better off "the Leafs would be without bad boy Billy Duke and his turned on girlfriend." Boy, those guys hit pretty hard. That's too much. [overlapping comments] Better take the knife out of your back, Duke. [Duke] Hey. You see the sports page today? Yeah, I just saw it. Listen, what time does that bus leave? It leaves in about an hour, I think. Will you cover for me? There's something I have to do. Yeah, I'll cover for you, but don't be too long. Okay. Sherri! Sher! Sherri! Sherri! Where the hell is she? Go ahead, Billy. Go ahead, hit me. Well, come on. You've hurt everybody else, one more isn't gonna matter. Hurt? I didn't hurt anybody. I didn't hurt Sherri. You guys did, with all that junk. Oh, man, that's heavy, that is. I've been trying to get her out. You screwed her up so bad, there's just no way. Me? Well, who else, Billy? Who took her on that walking through a winter wonderland trip? [mocking] "Oh, I'll be home for Christmas, "With good, old, white haired mom, serving up that deep dish apple pie." Christ. You even had a kid and a dog in your number. I never knew. You never knew. Do you know anything, Billy? Did you ever stop looking at yourself long enough to see this kid? It's Mighty Mouse, out to save the world! And along comes Mr. Mayhem. Well, you were it, man. Right on. The far-out, spaced-out, mind-blowing answer for every one of her hang-ups. I still am. I want her to marry me. That's beautiful. Look, I have to go. Tomorrow's our last game. In half an hour, a bus is taking us out to the inn on the park. We'll be there until game time. Just tell Sherri to meet me at the parking lot at nine tonight. Should she bring her own minister? 9:00. At 9:00 we'll be on a bus for San Francisco. Just tell her. Billy. I'm not getting through to you. Now, look, when I said you were Sherri's way out, I meant in her mind. Do you really think I could send her out there with you? Is it as bad as where she's at now? Look, I may not be your idea of an answer, but I'm as close as she's ever gonna come. All right, once again, there won't be any excuses, no phone calls in or out 'til game time tomorrow night. And don't try to use the pay phone, because if you're caught, it's an automatic hundred bucks. Remember, you're here for one reason, one reason only, to concentrate on tomorrow night. Either we win, or we have an early vacation, unpaid. There'll be a skate at noon tomorrow. And, one more thing... 9:00 curfew. 9:00? Are you kidding, Coach? 9:00. Are our mothers gonna be there to tuck us in too? Yours will, George. I don't know about these guys. [man on p.a.] Greyhound Super Cruiser service for Chicago and San Francisco, platform nine. What's this? I'm sorry, Barney. I couldn't. Is that all? Aren't you gonna ask me why? It doesn't matter why. The only way we can get to San Francisco is if you sell the car. But you don't wanna do that, it's up to you. Could you try once not to be so bloody understanding? Barney, I... I couldn't stand being so far away. [crying] ♪♪ Look at me. I'm a mess. [crying] I... I can't. I don't even know where to sleep. Sherri... I have a message for you. How can you say it doesn't mean anything? Because I happen to know he hasn't seen her for more than three months. People who read Walsh's column don't know that. You'd better tell them, 'cause I got a game to worry about. Perhaps, if you'd handled the kid properly, we wouldn't have to worry about it. Perhaps. Well, let's make one thing abundantly clear, Freddy. I can't afford to be out of the playoffs three years in a row. Neither can I. It's nearly nine. I'd better round up the guys. [crickets chirping] [background conversations] All right, guys, it's nearly nine. [Billy] Sherri. Oh. I can't believe it. When Barney told me, I thought it was a joke or something. [Billy] That Barney is some joker. He told me that you wanted to... That I want you to marry me. Sherri, I love you. And I need you. I need you-- I really, really need you. Next week we'll get Joe. You know Joe, my lawyer? I'm sure he knows someone who could fix you up. You know, with medicine they do fantastic things these days. You know, with the proper care, who knows? In a couple of weeks you could-- Tonight, Billy. Tonight I'm getting you a room right here. Tomorrow after the game, I'm picking you up, we're going up home-- No, no, I want to get married tonight. I can't get a license until Monday. Now, Billy, please? Sherri. Please. [Freddy]Billy! What are you doing? You were supposed to be in bed 15 minutes ago. Coach, you know Sherri Lee Nelson. Now, get up to your room. I'll deal with you in the morning. Just give me five minutes. You don't have five seconds. Now, get going. Look, there's a couple things we gotta straighten out. Just give me five minutes. You can take the rest of the year off, Billy. If you don't move right now, you're finished. You take a room where I told you. Now, I'll pick you up after the game. And don't worry, everything's gonna be just fine. Sherri... What are you doing here tonight? You know he's got one of the most important games of his career. You're only upsetting him at a time when he needs to relax and concentrate on the game. Now, good night. Good night. [Chief] Easy on that hand. Maybe you don't care, but the team's gonna need you tomorrow night. What am I, some kind of bum boy? "Yes, sir, no, sir, anything you say, sir." You're a slave, by choice. We all are. Haven't you figured that out yet? Great White Hunter say jump, we jump. Great White Hunter no like Billy Duke, sell Billy Duke new master. Will you cut it out, please? All I'm trying to say is, you had no choice. Not if you intend to go on playing this game. Yes, could you tell me if a Miss Sherri Lee Nelson has checked in in the last few minutes? Yes, I'll wait.
