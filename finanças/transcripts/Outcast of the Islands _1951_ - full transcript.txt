Captain Lingard, Captain. The scoundrel, where is he? - What a fool I was to trust him. - Shall we have him arrested Mr. Hudig? I'd never have believed it. How could anyone after all I've done for him? 350, 450, 1,000 pounds. He has more of my money than I have myself. Of course, he may have saved it for you Mr. Hudig. - I'm sure he's done that. - Shall we send for the police Mr. Hudig? I shall see him first, where is he? Why isn't he at his desk? Has he run away? I suspect only as far as the billiard table Mr. Hudig. - Then fetch him, wherever he is, now. - At once Mr. Hudig. Hurry. Ricksha Ricksha. Oh, bad luck Mr. Willems. I like the difficult ones, it's more of a challenge. Billiards is like life Ramsey, you got to take risks. Fine, if you got the money but I don't see... Nonsense, nonsense, you got to start somewhere. When I first came here, I hadn't a penny in the world. Had I? Not a penny. You have the gift of attracting money Mr. Willems. Oh, I don't know. I've had my fair share of luck, of course but take my advice Ramsey. Always have enough to keep one jump ahead of the next fellow and trust no one. - Not even your best friend. - Quite right Mr. Willems. Perhaps it's better not even to have a best friend, don't you think? You're up early, got the sack of all? Boy, bring three gin slings. Ramsey, you better have one. Might do you more good than listening to me. You're too modest Mr. Willems. I don't know what would happen if you ever had to leave Mr. Hudig. Oh, he'd manage, no one is indispensable. Oh, I'm sure no one would ever be able to repeat what you've done. Good heavens Mr.Hudig could never have got on... without him in the last 5 years and you know it. I must admit he has made quite a difference with the profits. I expect we'll all be working much harder in the next five years. You will Mr. Willems, there's no doubt about that, none at all. - Captain Lingard is back. - Harry Harry, look. Captain Lingard is back. I wonder what cargos he's brought back this time. There you are Ramsey, that's where I started. - You know Captain Lingard? - Since I was half your age. Isn't it a pity you didn't stay with him? He's become a rich man now. You might've found out where he gets his cargos perhaps. - His trading place? That river of his? - Didn't he ever let you into his secret? - You might've made some bit of money. - He's not going to give that away. Oh, no wonder he's been so successful, no wonder. Hey, you up there... If any of you fellows want to know where he does his trading, I'll tell you. Get a ship as fast as his and follow him. I tried to follow him once, easier to catch a porpoise. Your wife Mr. Willems, look. There was a rumor he was off the Borneo Coast last year. Well, she's quite happy. Anyway, he put into Macassar soon after, loaded down with tin. He's not going to tell anyone, I don't think he'd even tell me. Not that I'd bother him, of course. Oh, I was told you tried everything to find out where he does his trading. - Fine way of showing your gratitude. - Now, what do you mean by that? Didn't he pick you up or something when you were starving... when you hadn't got a farthing in the world? Am I wrong? That's quite true, that just goes to show there's hope for everyone who makes... the most of their opportunities. Doesn't it Vinck? Even you. Well, I'm going back now, hat boy. Oh, that reminds me Mr.Hudig wants to see you about something. - A financial problem, I believe. - Was it anything important? Well, I don't think there's anybody else who could give him the information he requires. Good. My dear, what a pleasant surprise. But you shouldn't be out shopping in all this heat. It's not good for that delicate complexion of yours. Were you wanting to see me, by any chance? I was only in there playing billiards. Why didn't you send in a message? Is there anything I can do for you? - Did you speak to Mr. Hudig? - What about? Oh, that job for your brother. Yes, well, he's got to learn to be patient. You did promise to speak to him last night. He waited up till nearly 2 o'clock in the morning for you. No, no, you're not going to blame me for coming in late. - Oh, he's desperate. - Yes, yes. We'll find something for him... but you must remember my dear, that I am a very busy man. I have plenty to think about, and you're not to nag, you must not nag. After all, I'm not the kind of man your brother is. The kind of man who's willing to sit at the same desk for the rest of his life. - Look out. - See who's coming in Mr. Willems. A fine sight, eh? Or not. See you unload our cargo before you start on his. There no favorites here, everyone takes his turn. So she still floats, does she? How have you managed to get along without me? - Hi, you lonesome millionaire. - Hello Captain Lingard. - Are you still with Hudig? - I'm his manager now. Manager, eh? I always knew it. Get up to Mr. Hudig's office. - Tell him I'm in. - I'll see you there. Get out. Out, get out. Your protege, this one piece of cargo I could've done without. What's the boy done this time? You thought he was smart when you picked him out... of the gutter and took him to sea, didn't you? Too smart to be a sailor, I suppose, with such gifts. So you had to pass him on to me to cheat and swindle honest people. You are too fond of running other people's lives Tom. You should stick to ships Tom, you understand them. Come now. What have you brought me this time? Oh, you great man. I've heard what I've waited for all these years. I'm not afraid now, you're less than dirt. Nobody, do you hear? This house is mine... you can go and boast somewhere else, I despise you. I thank you, for the first time in our life, you make me happy. You've always been a stone around my neck, you know that, do you? I would never have told you so but you've made me. Now, before I pass your gate, you will be gone from my mind. You make it very easy, thank you. I only want the money for defense lawyers, I'm going into damages Ramsey, big damages. So you see, if you invest a bit now, I'll see you get good interest for it. - What do you say to that, eh? - I'm a bit short just at the moment. - You're not short of 20 pounds, surely. - 20 pounds, I'd like to do what I can, but I've very little on me. - About what? - Is ten shillings any good? Oh, get out, what you take me for, a street beggar or something? I'll never try and help you again, you infernal little cad. Why Mr. Willems, what a lot of noise you're making. Not very wise is it, just now? The police are looking for you, you know. Could you let me have 20 pounds for a week or two, I want to get away for a bit. 20 pounds, you say? 20 pounds for Mr. Willems' holiday fund? Oh dear, oh dear, empty. Nothing there. Quite empty, what must you think of me? I seemed to have spent every farthing I've had, the fact is I've been celebrating. - Have you? - Yes, celebrating your dismissal. Go on, get out. We don't want any trouble here. Get yourself arrested somewhere else. Morning Captain, morning Captain. Morning, morning, morning Captain. Oh. Good night. Hey, what's that over there? Turn around. Come on quick, hurry up now. Straight along, straight along. Wait, wait. - So it's you, is it? - Let me out. - No, you don't. - Let me go, let me out. Come on, now. It's all your fault, why don't you throw me back? You helped at the beginning, you ought to have a hand at the end. I've been buzzing over this town like a blue bottle fly looking for you high and low. Well, you'll think what you're going to do. Hudig is told the police. - I'd like to kill him. - You've made enough trouble here already. Now you go back to your wife, she's a good woman. - You can face it together. - Yes, she's a good woman. But to live under the reproach of her pitying smile, no, no. I always thought you were heartless Willems... apt to cast adrift those that thought most of you. Now, I appeal to what's best in you. - Don't abandon that woman. - She's been a good wife to me. And I love her as much as she loves me, every bit. But as to going back there now? I'd rather hide down there at the bottom. It's hard, I grant that but who's the fault, eh? Captain Lingard, if you leave me here now, you'll be murdering me. I'll never be arrested by the police, wife or no wife. - You might as well cut my throat here now. - Now, don't try and frighten me Willems. I can tell you to go and drown yourself and there's the end of you. But I won't. Picked you up as a boy and I can't help feeling responsible for you in a way. Although you left me. Almost ashamed of myself but I could understand your dirty pride. I'll see this thing through, the second time Willems, I take you in hand. You mind it's the last. The only difference between then and now is you were barefooted then and have boots now. In 14 years with all your smartness, poor result that. - Very poor result. - You think I'm so very happy? Not another word will pass my lips. Had to speak my mind once, seeing I knew you from a child, more or less. Now I shall forget. But you are young yet, life is very long. Let this be a lesson to you? Isn't she a sweet craft? I can make her do anything but talk. Better than a wife to me, never scolds, eh? Come on. Ships and the sea, you can trust them. Ah but you wouldn't believe that. Not enough money in them, eh? I'm taking you to that place of my own about which people talk so much and know so little. It's up a river, it isn't easy, but I've found a way to get her up. You'll learn something now my boy. More than you ever learned among a lot of long-shore quill drivers. - Where is it? - Eh? To the northward my boy, the northward. Come on up, now you going to see some fun. Blast. You're not going in there, are you? Don't think I do much sailing in the middle of the ocean, do you? Man the weather braces. - Hoist the gaff topsails. - Set all sail. There's an underwater rock off your starboard bow, watch out for it. Don't bother looking at them... it's the underwater rocks I'd like to see, any sign yet? - Now you take over. - What? Here? Forgotten everything I taught you? Now bring her around, down that channel over there when I say. Steady, steady. Now, hard left, hard left. Captain. Take in a bit on the mizzen sheet. - Think we should lose a little speed. - Can't afford to take in the sails. She's safer this way, we going to starboard now, wait for it. Hard down. Steady now. Keep quiet about my river when you do get back. There's many give their ears for the knowledge of it. Your secret safe with me. Getting near now. - Man in the chains Mr. Mate. - Aye. But what am I going to do here? Where you going next? Can't I come with you? No, you stay here quietly with my partner my boy, till I come back. He's a nice fellow, married that girl I adopted. Little Red Riding Hood, where you going? She looked far, she saw the first piece. And her mother told her to go into the woods... with a nice basket of things which her granny wanted. A big voice came from behind her, little Red Riding Hood, where you going? - Dear? - And the wolf said... - Look. - What big teeth you've got Grand-mama? Goodness darling Captain Lingard is coming, come along, come along. Is he going to take us to Singapore? Not this time darling but he will very soon. Get your dress on dear and put her into something nice. Where's my coat? Ali, bring me my coat. Now, you're going to be very nice to Grandpa, aren't you darling? Because he's come a long way to see you and he's brought you lovely presents... - so you'll give him a nice kiss. - I don't want to, his beard pricks me. It not if you do it properly dear, like that. Lower gaff topsails. Stand by topsail halyards. See that they get all of this stuff out of the way, will you? Ah, Babalatchi, come to add your welcome? What do you want now? Our chief El Badavi asks for a meeting to speak with Captain Lingard. He surely doesn't expect to see him now, does he? - It is important. - It always is. And if it is possible Tonight. - I'll try and arrange it. - Thank you Mr. Almayer. - Now, come on. - Must I? I don't want to. Quickly quickly. Now, don't be a naughty girl Nina quickly. Stop it doing that Nina, stop it child, stop it at once. Hey, hey, Keep back. Mr. Mate, get those crowd back. - Almayer. - Welcome Lingard, welcome home. Oh, there you are at last, what you've been doing? - Your hair is all straggling out. - Yes, I know dear. I do wish you'd try and make the best of yourself. Now, remember what I told you to say? That's right. - No dear, never mind that. - No, thank you so much dear, I'm sorry. That's right, tie it off. Oh, no. Come along now, get the gangway down. Get off. Clear off, you little devils. Get them off, the whole lot of them. - The rascals will sink me one of these days. - Let her wait, she'll fall in. - Dear? - What? - Look. - Make fast astern there. Oh, it's good to see you Almayer, you look well. - Welcome home, did you have a good voyage? - Excellent, excellent. - Ah, my little princess, prettier than ever. - Clever too. - Remembers everything you tell her. - We all lover you so Grand-papa. She was the first one to see your sails, kept saying, Grandpa is coming. Didn't you dear? Hang it, I forgot all about you Willems. Almayer, I want you to meet my friend Willems. He's going to help you run the place, take some of the work off your shoulders. I'm leaving him in your care till I come back. How do you do? My care? No, thank you. Ah, glad to see you. - Who is he? Why you leaving him here? - Willems? Why not? - Be of great help to you. - Help? Do you think I need help? You're not satisfied with the way I run the place. But you know these young fellows can teach us a thing or two, eh? He's not particularly young, you think? I brought some good stuff with me this time Almayer, been very lucky. We start doing business tomorrow, eh? Ah, how good it is to be back home. Don't supposed you've seen dancing like this before. Oh, you can see this any night you like in Singapore if you've nothing better to do. But these fellows are different, you know. This is the real thing. Yes? Good. Do you have an interesting job in Singapore? Don't like the place. Something in the shipping line, I suppose. - Yes, I was Hudig's traffic manager. - Oh, that must've been interesting. I can't imagine what made you decide to come here. Oh, I've been wanting to come to this place for a long time. - You married Mr. Willems? - My dear... Well, I haven't brought a wife here, if that's what you mean. - Look after him while I'm away. - Yes, yes, I'll try. - I hope you won't be bored here. - Why? Are you? Who, me? Good gracious, no. Haven't got any time to be bored. I'm much too busy, Captain Lingard knows that. Oh, a regular volcano. I'm afraid Mr. Willems may find it a little dull here after Singapore. Mr. Willems doesn't like Singapore, my dear. I find that very odd. Personally, I long to be there. Yes, of course you do and every day brings the time a little nearer. When we do go, we'll have made our fortune. - Oh, I wasn't thinking only of the money. - No, no, no. Of course you weren't. They asked if they could see you this evening, I'll tell them it's not convenient. No, no, we'll see them. Willems? - Greetings Captain. - Welcome Babalatchi. You'll permit me to speak for my chief, the blind El Badavi and his daughter Aissa. As you know Tuan, they do not understand your language. Will you sit? My friend Mr. Willems. - Anything I can do for you? - There is one small favor we would ask Tuan. We of Badavi's tribe are but poor people, we gain our living by our fishing. We drag our nets through the narrow places of the river... but they are caught by the rocks under the water and are torn. - Our women cannot mend them quickly enough. - I've the very thing for you. Yes Tuan? Your nets are too weak, you need stronger twine. I've three bales of this in my ship. - You can have all you need. - That alone is not sufficient Tuan. But the gunpowder in your stores, if you give us some of that... we can explode the rocks under the water and then we can fish in safety. Is that the only reason you need gunpowder Babalatchi? So that you can fish in safety? So? Or do you need it to widen the channels between the rocks... to bring up an Arab trading ship? Or perhaps blast a road through the jungle, eh? With what care and at what risk did I... study this river, learned every inch of it, learned to master it, to love it? Now you want to push me out to bring in your own trader. Now listen to me. Every one of you of Badavi's tribe is welcome in Simbia. Welcome to live here, but this is a peaceful place... a thriving place because I've made it so, the people are happy. Because my tradings brought them prosperity, don't try to deceive me Babalatchi. You tried to seize power for Badavi all down this coast. You made trouble, caused bloodshed and misery wherever you went. You failed, so you came here. I warm you. Don't start anything of that kind now or it'll be the worst for you. But we were talking only of the fishing Tuan. Fishing, the... You want your own trader and you know it. It's no good Babalatchi, I won't have this place upset, understand? - Does the white man know what's best for us? - I've no more to say, I am your friend. Take care not to make me your enemy. - Now go in peace. - In peace Tuan? Hurry up there, we're sailing on this tide. - All ready Captain Lingard. - Aye, I'm coming. On the way out, I'll go back over these rocks on account of the high spring tide. This is where you took over, remember? - Think you can manage it without my help? - On my next trip I'll take you home. By then, your troubles will have blown over, I'll see to that. Then you must think about your future. Meanwhile, work hard make a success. Perhaps it was meant to happen. Who knows? I'm sure of it, quite sure. There's mostly rubber we've got this time, rubber and tin. That's a fine bale of cargo you're leaving me with. - Won't you change your mind? - What about? Take him with you, I don't need any help. I've always run this place on my own. We don't want a lot of strangers around here. You never should've brought him here in the first place. Well, I'm the best judge of that. Don't you worry about him. Better start getting your men ashore. You ought to put something on your head, you don't know the sun in these parts., Get ready to make sail, stand by to cast off. Tuan. - Mr. Willems, you like fishing? - It passes the time. Well, I never see you catch a fish before. - Observant little girl, aren't you? - Why don't you help Daddy and me? Busy checking the stores, I see. What's the point? You only do it yourself five minutes later. It's important, I might miss something. That's why I asked your help. Is that my hat you're wearing? Oh, yes. - If you don't want to, never mind. - Take it. Oh no my dear fellow, you might get sunstroke. You wouldn't like me to do something worthwhile. Something worthwhile? Oh yes, of course. Yes, how about taking charge of the men up on the hills? That's impossible, you know quite well I don't know their language. Oh, I forgot, how silly of me. And it's so hot up there, isn't it? Never mind, we'll have to think of something. Caught anything yet? No. Well, don't worry, we got plenty of fish. Tuan. Ah Mr.Willems. Come up please. Come up, give me your hand. You have kindly come to visit us. You have not been over the river before. - No, I've been busy. - Busy, of course. Tell me, do, do all these houses belong to you? - These are the houses of our people. - Oh? I thought you liked to wander. For the moment we are settled here. What a pity that when we first met Captain Lingard was... Well, you will remember perhaps. He's sometimes impatient with us on this side of the river. I hope you do not think badly of me and of my people. Of course I don't, why should I? Tell me, does this little beast belong to you too? Oh, not to us, not to anyone, he is a river boy. He has no family, only his canoe. I wish he'd leave me alone, find someone else to run after. He's proud to be seen with so great a man Mr.Willems. You know, it would gladden the heart of our blind... chief El Badavi if you would enter his house. He's old now but he was once great and strong. Now he is old. Tuan Willems. El Badavi says he's honored to receive the great white trader. Just return the compliment. Oh, it doesn't matter. Say I'm proud to be his guest and I hope he's well. His health is good but for his blindness of course. Ah Mr.Willems. I'm delighted to meet you, I've heard of you in Singapore., - This is our friend Mr. Alagappan. - So you came up the river. - Oh yes, yes. Well, why not? - Well, I admire your courage and your skill. Well, the skill is mostly Lingard's but... Well anyway, if you know anything about ships... there's not a great deal to it, you know, as long as you know the ropes. Unfortunately, I do not know the ropes. Otherwise, I would've be able to trade here myself. I was hoping very much that I too might be able to sail up the river this time. Had it been found possible to blast some of the rocks. - But it was not to be. - Well, you must be disappointed. Your plan miscarried, what a pity? The pity is that Mr. Alagappan is not a great navigator like Captain Lingard. There's nothing difficult about bringing a ship up here. It's just a question of recognizing certain landmarks on the coast. Once you got them in your head, you can't go wrong. But first you must've those landmarks pointed out to you Mr. Willems. Ah Captain Lingard is a just man. Perhaps one day he will teach them to us. - Meanwhile, we must not be impatient. - It's easy for you to be patient. You haven't a long and dangerous journey on foot through the forest before you. Oh, you don't like walking? I'm not finding it a very profitable form of exercise at the moment. No, never mind, you mustn't give up hope. Oh no, I never do. Well, I must be on my way now. It was a pleasure to meet you Mr. Willems, I hope we shall meet again. Thank you. We Singapore exiles must've a lot in common. Think so? This is the priest all shaven and shorn that married the man all tattered and torn... that kissed the maiden all forlorn... That's a good girl, One more spoonful, and Daddy will read you some more. Why has Mr. Willems got his elbows on the table? I think Mr. Willems is ready for his pudding dear. I'm sure he won't mind waiting until Nina's finished. You know she won't eat her meat once she's seen the pudding. Unless of course, you're in a hurry. No, no, I don't want any pudding, thank you. I'm fascinated to know what happens, do go on. This is the cock that crowed in the morn that walked... waked the priest all shaven and shorn that married the man all tattered and torn that... kissed the maiden all forlorn... That's a good girl. Now give Daddy a nice surprise. That milked the cow with the crumpled horn that... tossed the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat. Don't Mr. Willems like the story Papa? In fact, he's heard Papa read it before dear and I think Mr. Willems has some work to do. - What sort of work? - I think he's going fishing, silly man. Now, that's very rude dear. We must all try and be kind to Mr. Willems. Why must we? Because it's important that he should feel at home here until Grand-papa... comes to take him back to Singapore. Oh, I didn't know, I'm sorry, that's very worrying. We shall have to try and amuse him. Have you any suggestions? Well, he told me one day that he enjoyed playing cards... so I thought we might have a game one evening. I know I don't play very well, but I will try not to spoil it. If he does play, probably cheats. - Why you say that? - Instinct. Oh? What a nice surprise for Papa. Tuan. You're beautiful. Cards? Willems. - I'm sorry. - You want any cards? Just a second, let me see. I'll twist. I'm so glad we decided to play Mr. Willems, my husband loves cards. - Oh, yes? - Have you finished? Twist again. - That's enough. - One card please. - You must say twist or buy. - I forgot, twist please. - 20, 22, 24... - Too many. Just you and I Willems. - Blast. - Oh, what a shame dear. Let me see your first two cards. Show me these cards. You're more than 21. - Why didn't you say so? - Oh, I'm sorry. - Yes, so I have. - I should've known better. What did I tell you? - I wasn't cheating. - Oh, I know you weren't. It's just that your thoughts were elsewhere. Oh, what a place? So, that's why you wanted us to play cards. How long have you known? For some time, I think. - I wasn't spying. - No, no, of course you weren't. - Sorry I laughed. - There's nothing to be sorry about. What's her name? Aissa, I should've thought you've known that too. Aissa. It's a pretty name. I've only ever heard her called Badavi's daughter. She's very brave. - Yes? - She used to fight at her father's side. They say that she's braver than any of her brothers. And quite merciless. What are you making? Paper chains for my husband's birthday. It's a surprise. - May I help you? - Of course. - Does your husband like paper chains? - Nina does. She doesn't get many parties here, when we go back... to Singapore I'll make it up to her then, it'll be different. I swear I'll never go over there again. And then I find myself waiting for her, every day it's the same. I know all you're trying to tell me but what am I to do? This gum, it doesn't stick very well, I suppose it's the damp. I see her all the days, all the nights. I see her every breath, every glance of her eye, every movement of her lips. I see nothing else, what else is there? Are you afraid? Of what she is and what you might become? You do well to be afraid. - I do hope Mr. Willems never comes. - Why dear? - Then I can stay up all night. - Oh dear, the candles are going out. I'm not surprised, they're not supposed to last forever. It's all right dear, I'll get some more. Hope you got a good supply. It looks as if you may need them. It's such a pity. He's missing all the dancing. I don't think that'll worry him. He doesn't like our sort of dancing. Wouldn't it be better to eat something first dear? I thought we weren't supposed to touch the food until your precious Mr. Willems arrives. Now, you will try and be extra nice to him tonight, won't you? Oh, of course. I provide a house for him to live in... food for him to eat, whiskey for him to drink, I may as well be nice to him as well. - You better put her to bed. - Oh no dear, no. He'll be here soon, I know, he promised. Oh, he promised, did he? Well, of course that makes a difference. I'm quite sure Mr. Willems would never break a promise. Sorry, am I late? Oh, no, we were just lighting the candles, aren't they pretty? - Why only six? - We'll cut the cake now. Have you got a present for Daddy? Oh yes, yes. Now let me see, what should we give him? - Shall we give him a puff puff? - Only one? - You think he'd like a puff puff? - Yes, give him that. - Do it again, do it again. - I don't think he likes it very much. You think we're going to eat that now? - A bit of a waste, eh? - Take it away. Go on, go on, take it away. - Nina, come to bed. - I don't want to Mama. Say good night to your father Nina. Good night Papa, happy birthday. I'm sorry. How old are you today? I must say your party manners are charming. Why isn't Lingard back yet? I asked you a question Almayer. If I'd known the answer I've given it to you. - Is he often as late as this? - No, he usually comes when he says he will. When he does come, you must tell him how helpful I've been to you. You can be sure of that, I wonder what he'll do with you next. - Make me a partner, perhaps. - It's what you're after, isn't it? Am I? Lend me your gun, I think I'll go and look for a deer. Well, you might say yes or no instead of making that ridiculous noise. If I believed a word of what you said, I would. What's the use? The gun is there, take it or leave it. Gun, deer, rubbish, you mighty hunter. You need gold anklets and silk sarongs to catch your kind of game. It's a gazelle you're after Willems, a two legged gazelle. You better watch out, they can be very dangerous. You shouldn't drink so much Almayer. You've no head for it. At least I drink my own Willems. I drink my own. Hey, you've forgotten the gun, you'll have to catch your deer with your bare hands. When you find her, bring her back. We'll stuff her and hang her over the door. - You think he's been eaten by a crocodile? - No dear, I don't think so. Why you put that filthy stuff in your hair? Stinks. Aissa, Aissa. Aissa. What a perfect relationship ours is. I wonder what you would think of me if you could understand a word of what I say. I could even tell you the truth, if I knew what it was. Something between loving... and hating. Stronger than either. I am reminded I don't know why, of a party I once went to in Singapore. It was at Government House and... very elegant it was, it was just like this. Her Excellency, I remember, dropped her fan. I was about to be presented. I stooped and picked it up and she said, thank you Mr. Willems. I replied that. Oh, what's the use? It isn't true anyway. Oh, get out of it. Go, go on, go on. Go on then, go on. Go on. Go on. Oh, why you want to live in all this slime? Never mind, it'll all be different when Lingard comes back and we go to Singapore. With what I've got in here and what I know about... this river, we'll be rich when we get to Singapore. Now, listen, how many more times? You, me, away from here. To Singapore. Oh well, you will anyway. Are you really as brave as they say? Did you ever kill anybody? Go away, will you? Aissa. - Aissa. - Oh, now your father is squawking again. Oh, let him squawk, you belong to me now. It's time that father of yours knew how to feed himself, come back. Aissa. Come back, come here. Aissa, out of the way. Aissa, come back. Out of the way. Aissa, come back. Help. Aissa. Go away. Get a towel, a towel. And get Babalatchi, you miserable half staff. - Where's Babalatchi? - Tuan? Come here. I want you to tell this... miserable, bloodthirsty old ruin that I'm looking after his daughter now. That she's his servant no longer and that if I hear him bawling out for her again... I'm coming right over here and I'm going to wring his neck. That would not be wise Tuan. El Badavi is our chief, he's also Aissa's father. - He commands our respect and her obedience. - Never mind, you tell him... What's he saying? What's he talking about? - He has cursed you Mr. Willems. - Oh, has he? Well, that's, that's not very helpful, is it? Mr. Willems, let me explain. He is old, his daughter must be his eyes and his right hand. He does not yet understand what a great man you are. He's unhappy because his people are poor. - Well, I can't help that. - You could. You are brave, you are skillful, you could do much good to our people. You did learn from Captain Lingard the ways up the channels of our river. If you now would teach them to Mr. Alagappan. - You remember, the Arab trader who was here. - Yes, yes, yes, a most ambitious man. You said yourself that it is easy to bring a boat up the river... - once you know the landmark. - Well, that's... That's some time ago. I, I may have forgotten. No, no. A man like you never says more than he can do. If you would but once bring up Mr. Alagappan's boat... you would put our chief and our people in your debt forever. How can you? Do you think I'm a blackguard? You really think I'm a cheat Babalatchi? Have you no sense of honor? Oh, no, no, no. Aissa. Aissa? Where's Aissa? Where is she? Well, where is she? Well, where is she? Have you seen Aissa? Ah Mr.Willems. - Am I interrupting a private conversation? - Oh, not at all Mr. Willems. Please please, join us. There is little formality on this side of the river, as you have no doubt discovered. I didn't expect to see you so soon. Did you come by the river this time? Unfortunately no, I left my ship at the mouth... of the river and had to walk through the jungle again. You are troubled? - Where have you hidden her, you blackmailer? - Why curse at me Mr. Willems? - You are in her hand. - And we are in your hands Mr. Willems. You've sailed ships before and you know how to navigate the river. If you will help us, I promise you that I will see that you find her again. And perhaps you may persuade her to change her mind and go with you to Singapore. - And if I refuse? - I have seen much and I say to you submit. To her or to you in bringing your boat up the river? You may never see her again. - You threaten me? - No, I spoke only of life. A long life for a lonely man. I'm sorry to depress you but I'm afraid you're in for another long walk. - Oh, I hope not, I do hope not. - The price you ask is too high. I don't have to buy her, she's mine already and I can find her myself. She can't have got very far with that blind old father of hers. If you change your mind we shall still be here. Have you seen Aissa? Tuan. Oh, get out of it. Aissa? I'm looking for Badavi's daughter, have you seen her? Listen, will you tell Babalatchi that... Aissa. Aissa. Tuan. Tuan. - Aissa. - What? - Where? - Aissa. Show me, come on, show me, show me. It's all right now, it's all right. Not so fast, slower, slower. Wait a minute, wait. Aissa. Right, that'll do. Off you go, go on. You didn't hide from me, did you? Tell me they made you. You are my life. Come with me now. Almayer. - Who's that? - Here. Down here, it's me. Can I come up? The child is asleep, I've no wish to speak to you. - It's important. - Not to me, surely. Yes, to you. Very important, you be sorry if you don't. You funny fellow. If you knew what a sight you looked. Alright, come up, don't make a noise. - I've come for your good and mine. - You look as if you've come for good feed. Don't they give you enough to eat, those new relations of yours? That old blind scoundrel must be delighted with your company. You know he was the greatest thief and murderer of these seas. You exchange confidences together? You kill somebody in Singapore or you only steal... - It's not true. I only borrowed... - Don't shout at me. Not with your friends now across the river. This is my house, a civilized house, understand? So you did steal, eh? I always thought so. And now here you steal again. Oh- Oh, no, I don't mean from me, I haven't missed anything. For that girl, eh? You didn't pay the old fellow, did you? She's not worth anything to him now that you've borrowed her. Listen Almayer, I suffer horribly and for your sake. For my sake? I know only the, the despair of her presence... and the agony of her departure. Her face is always before me... blinding me so I, I can't see my way. And when I close my eyes, hers... - hers stare into my soul. - You do bore me Willems. Now she's gone. I hadn't heard the news. Had enough of you already? That's not very flattering for you, is it? My superior fellow countryman. - I'd like to kill you. - You're too weak for that. What a disgusting exhibition. What did Lingard ever see in you? I wonder. Whatever plans he had for you, he'll have to revise them now. You've thrown your chances away for nothing. Flung them under the feet of a damn savage woman... who's already trampled you into the thing you are... and will kill you very soon one way or another... - with her love or with her hate. - What right have you to preach to me? I never wanted a job in a place like this but you... you're prepared to sell your soul and your wife and child for a few miserable pounds. Not so few, my friend. And to think that I was once afraid that Lingard might make you his partner. Not even Lingard would touch you now with a pair of tongs. Almayer. I want to work with you, not here. On the other side of the river. Lingard couldn't object, I'd be starting another trading post for him, that's all. It would help him and you. We could all work together. Of course I, I, I should need some... trade goods and a little money, perhaps, to build a decent house. - I'm asking you for them all man. - Go on, go on, I'm listening. Well, I'd repay every cent, of course and and... And Lingard will approve, I, I'm sure. I'd only be expanding his work over there. A safe thing for you. Anything else you'd like? My coat perhaps? My boots? I don't fancy the investment Willems. Do you think I don't see through your little scheme? What do you want trade goods for? To buy back that fancy woman of yours? They want you to pay for her after all, do they? Your position is not as safe as you think Almayer. If a rival could get up the river he could destroy your trade overnight. Ruin you. - They've made proposals to me already. - I'm master of this place. If we could all work together, not against each other... - Can't you see? - Yes, I see a mysterious ass. You think you can bluff me with your veiled threats? What do you bring me, a declaration of war? I ought to shoot you but you're not worth a bullet. You should've been destroyed with a stick like a snake. - Papa Papa. - It's alright my darling, you're quite safe. Get out, get out, do you hear? You're frightening the child. You wretched scarecrow, it's all right darling. Look, bad man is going now. He's afraid of your papa, nasty bad man. Never come near my little girl again, if he does Papa will kill him. See how he runs away? Isn't he funny? Call pig after him dearest. - Call pig, pig, pig, pig. - Pig, pig, pig. Pig, pig, pig. Pull on the sheets. Look bad from here, don't they? Man leave places. - Listen Mr. Willems, I won't go on. - You're getting all this down, aren't you? Yes, yes. Don't bother about them but we are going too fast. Open jib, see. Aren't they in line yet? Keep your eyes open. She'll clear your harbor nicely. Tuan Almayer. Tuan Almayer. My darling, it's Grand-papa at last. Thank heavens, come along. - Ali Nina quickly. Quickly dear, come. - Will I have to kiss him again? Where's my coat? Ali Ali, bring me my coat. What's that lot? Babalatchi wasn't quite sure of the sort of welcome we should get. He's just protecting us. For a man of your success, you're a very bad judge of character... to make an agreement with a man like Babalatchi and expect him to keep his word. - My agreement is only with Badavi. - He can't last much longer. Why, the other day, he just foamed at the mouth, he fell on his back. If Badavi dies, my agreement dies with him. I'd like to make an agreement with you myself. You think Mr. Almayer would be prepared to listen to any proposals from me? - Or from you? - What does he matter? When Lingard comes back, I'll tell him that you and I are partners. - Then we can all work together, eh? - Yes, we shall have to talk about that. Aissa, Aissa. What boat is that? What's going on Almayer? Another birthday party? You filthy pirate Willems. - You're not the only trader in Sambia now. - You'll pay for this. I'm coming over for some stores. You'd better let me have them. I've told you before, you won't get anything from me. Come with me and get the guns. Come on Ali. You take these, there you are. We can use the barrels to barricade... Ali Ali... What are they frightened of? Are they scared of you leading them? - Mr. Alagappan, your men ready? - They're there Mr. Willems. You looking for trouble Willems, you're coming to the right place. I promise you, I'll kill anyone who lands on my ground. You make a very impressive figure Almayer. - Get back into the house, get back. - Nina, come. - Hide Nina. - Come Nina. Don't try to be a hero, you fool, put down that gun. We're only going to the warehouse. Don't be a... Stop, come back. Stop it, leave him alone. Take him up there. Into the hammock. You blackguard. - Where is Aissa? - I don't know, I haven't seen her. Her father is calling for her, he's ill dangerously. What's the matter with him? One of his curses boomeranged? - Put him down there. - I must go back to him. When you see her, tell her to come to her father. Alright. Stay here, you'll be perfectly safe but don't come out. It's just a game darling, just a silly game. Here you, take this, take this. Oh Mummy, let me go and play too. - You're mad. - Alright, put him over there. You used to be very fond of telling me I looked ridiculous. Thank you for giving me the chance to return the compliment. Pig, pig, pig, pig, pig, pig. Say pig, pig, pig dolly. Pig, pig, pig... Aissa. Aissa. Aissa. Look out Almayer, don't come too close, you hurt yourself. Next time Almayer, I get you next time. Aissa. Get back into the house, you'll be all right now. Get up. What is it, eh? What is it, eh? Her father is dead, did you not tell her to come? Aissa I, I... Hoist the gaff topsails. An outrage, a fiendish outrage. Is he still living over there? Oh no, the Arab's first act was to get rid of the Badavi tribe. What did I always tell you? He'll have no trouble from them. They've gone up river, kicked out of Sambia. The whole lot of them and Willems and the girl went with them. He's in her care now and I very much doubt if he'll find it as tender as yours. Cat, dog, anything that can scratch and bite as long as it's harmful and mangy enough. Half dead tiger that you can weep over and palm off on some poor devil in your care... to tend and nurse for you. Never mind what happens to the poor devil. Your tender heart only bleeds what's poisonous and deadly. - I curse the day when you set eyes on him. - Now then, now then. - Build me a house Grand-papa. - Of course I will. High one I hope and we'll all go live in Singapore. - I curse it. - Yes, my dear. What about that mongrel dog you brought on board at Bangkok? Went mad the next day and bit everybody, have you forgotten? Remember the time when you lost your ship by rescuing some Chinaman... who turned on you and killed half the crew? That was reckless enough in all conscience but this time you really done it. - We're ruined, finished. - You should've stopped them. - They took me by surprise. - You had rifles. Higher, Grand-papa. There was no one to use them, the men ran as soon as they saw the ship. - You call that putting up a fight? - You don't know, you weren't there. - You're clumsy Papa. - Now, run along now my dear. I'll build you another this evening. Can't you realize your day is over in Sambia and I'm not the one who is to blame? You knew Willems and you brought him here. You and your simple, childish trust. Well, now it's repaid you. You should've see him at the head of that hellish crowd. You would've been proud of your new favorite. - Smart fellow, Willems. - Smart? Is that all you have to say? Smart? What's to become of me? What's to become of my darling Nina? What's to become of your own daughter? You trapped me into marrying her so that you'll be free of that responsibility... free to sail the seas on your errands of mercy. And now, when my whole life's smashed and ruined... all you can say is the man who betrayed us was smart. Now you attend to what I have to say if you don't want to quarrel with me my boy. What about the people out here? I've no concern with your personal tragedy or mine, either, for that matter. We make mistakes and we pay for them one way or another, sooner or later. But what about these people? The ones that are paying already? Paying for Willems' treachery and my folly, if you like. Have you given a thought to them and the price they have to meet... with their bellies and their children and their lives? And these were once a happy people, a proud people, a prosperous people... because I made them so. They trusted me once and they trust me still. That's why they've crawled into the shadow of my house. Is it my fault? How can you talk like that? I talk as I think, I've lived many years, sit down Almayer. Don't make a spectacle of yourself. If you've been in trouble as often as I have my boy, you wouldn't carry on so. I've been ruined more than once, yet here I am, still in the ring. Why didn't you come back sooner? Why did you stay away so long? - Never would've happened if you'd been here. - You scold like a drunken fishwife. If you knew anything about ships... you'd know they have to go into dock now and then for repair. So Willems is upriver, eh? He's escaped us now but if ever he comes back, I'll see that something happens to him. Take care Almayer. You haven't been sewn up in a hammock and burned alive... to amuse a passel of savages. As long as he lives, I must walk here with my eyes on the ground. Do any of your men know the upper part of the river? There is one who managed the journey some years ago but... surely... I'm done up. Perfectly done up... from all this talk. It seems like I could go to sleep on a clothesline. Later I may want a canoe with some paddlers and... the man you said. Life is foul. Foul like a tangled lea on a dirty night. Yet one must see it clear for running... before going below for good. Turn in past those rocks. - Where is he? - He is not far away. - Is Badavi's daughter with him? - She is with him. Yet she is alone. Her father died cursing her because of her love for him. The man who destroyed your friends, who hastened Badavi's death... who plotted with Alagappan, first against you, then against me. Return to your own people Babalatchi, he is no concern of yours. Indeed. Then I shall leave him to you. Who am I to meddle in such matters? Who am I to act in anger or in haste? This is a good gun. - Foolish thing to load that old gun. - It carries far and true. - Better than this here. - Take your hand off that. Many years ago, we faced each other like this, with guns in our hands. Do you not remember Tuan? I don't remember every vagabond that comes my way. Have you so much disdain for your enemies that there is no room left for remembrance? - He's up there. - Take care, he's armed. Each day he comes down here with his mouth full of curses and his heart full of hate. I think that even in his sleep he's angry... because he can not forget that he's still alive. I have left my gun with you. Then perhaps, you will remember me. Let me pass. I will fetch him myself. Stand up, this does not concern you. Stand up, leave him. He's no good, he's finished. Don't you believe her Captain Lingard. I shall fight, I tell you, I shall fight. Look, that's a fine thing to do. If I'd wanted to hurt you, it was easy. I was standing up there long enough to use this thing. You would've missed, there is, under heaven, such a thing as justice. You came and dumped me in this river like a load of rubbish. Dumped me and left me with nothing to do, nothing good to remember or even hope for. And left me at the mercy of that fool Almayer. And then, look at her. What's she's been saying to you? She begged for your life if you want to know. As if the thing was worth giving or taking. For weeks she's begged me to take yours. For weeks she's given me no peace, planning and scheming... looking for places where I could hide and drop you with a safe shot as you walked up. It's true, I give you my word. - Your word? - Alright. Alright, you don't know, it isn't what I've done that torments me. It's the reason. It's the madness that drove me to it. Tomorrow she may want to kill me. I don't want to die here, take me away. You have been possessed of a devil. Yes, isn't it pretty? I regret nothing else I ever did but this was different. I picked you up like a starving cat when you were 12. I helped you through your life till it became part of mine. That I let you ruin the lives of all those that put their faith in me. - I am an old fool. - Evil is not in me Lingard. Then where else, confound you? Where else? Did you ever see me lie and cheat and steal? Tell me that, hey... I wonder where in perdition you came from when I found you under my feet. No matter, you'll do no more harm. Well, what do you expect? You know what you've done? What do you expect? Lingard, in the whole world, there's only been one man who ever cared for me. - Only one man, you. - Shut up. Of all my life, my past, future, my intelligence and worth, there's nothing left. But she, the cause of my ruin and you, you whom I've mortally offended. Take me away, anywhere, anywhere. - I promise you, I promise... - No promise of yours is any good to me. I'm going to take your future into my own hands, you're my prisoner. You shall stay here, you're not fit to go among people who could suspect... who could guess, who could imagine what is in you. I couldn't. You're my mistake. I shall hide you here. If I let you out, you'll go among unsuspecting men and lie and steal and cheat. For a little money or for some woman, I don't choose to shoot you. It would be the safest way but I won't. Don't expect me to forgive you. To forgive one must first be angry and then contemptuous. There's nothing in me now, no anger, no contempt, no disappointment. To me you're not Willems, the man I thought much of and helped the man who was my friend. You're not a human being to be destroyed or forgiven. You are a bitter thought, something without a body that must be hidden. - You are my shame. - You can't leave me in this place. You say that you don't want to die here. Very well then, you must live. Understand I leave him his life not in mercy but in punishment, you are alone. You say that you did this for her. - Well, you have her. - You think I'll stay? Not necessarily on this spot. There are the forests, here is the river. You may swim, take your choice. I can do it now. I can do it now. One shot. Yes but you see, you can't. There's not even that in you. Don't provoke me Captain Lingard. Provoke you? What is there in you to provoke? We shall meet again Captain Lingard.
