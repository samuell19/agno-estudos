But I can't even seem to do that right So let's see... I pissed off a random homeless person who by the way, peed in my mouth. and I'm 100% sure there was alcohol in his urine Then, I think I made really good friends with a stoner or some sort of Hippie. Not sure what language he speaks Exposed my testicles in front of the local teenagers And lastly -- [ glimmer shine ] (voice of Byron) Dear Nate... I know you're going through a tough time right now and I can't express how sorry I am to hear about a good young man such as yourself, suffering from despression and suicidal thoughts... but if you wanna live here motherfucka.. You're going to need to pay you're goddam rent! The rules apply to everybody! You don't I wont throw you out because you're acting like some bitch, Nate?! Peace dawg! This is me, evicting you!
