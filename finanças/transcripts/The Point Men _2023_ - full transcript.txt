PRESENTED BY PLUS M ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCED BY WATERMELON PICTURES ONETAKE FILM EXECUTIVE PRODUCER HONG JEONG-IN PRODUCED BY SHIN BUM-SOO, NAM JUNG-IL This film is inspired by actual events, but all characters and situations have been fictionalized. On Sept. 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda led by Osama bin Laden attacked the US. The US declared war on Afghanistan for giving refuge to bin Laden. 38 countries joined the war, with South Korea sending hundreds of non-combat troops. After losing power to a pro-US government, the Taliban turned to suicide bombing and kidnapping foreigners. AFGHANISTAN, ZABUL PROVINCE SEPTEMBER 19, 2006 Let us pray. Lord, please bestow Your grace on this barren land. Amen! And please let the seeds we plant today take root. Help the people of this land to understand that - Jehovah is their... - Lord. - one god. - Amen! We believe the Lord Jesus will be the King of all peace! Amen! Everyone okay? What's going on? Open the door! I'm just a bus driver. Please don't hurt me! Open up, now! Quiet! THE POINT MEN SOUTH KOREA, FOREIGN MINISTRY Deputy Kim! Yes? What happened? They were supposed to arrive at Kandahar yesterday, but they didn't. That's not what I mean! There's a travel ban on that country! They entered Dubai through Beijing, so we never expected... Just kill me already. What is this? They're all from the same church. What's their purpose for going there? We believe it's short-term missionary work. - What? - Look! We demand the Korean government to pull its troops out of Afghanistan immediately and promptly release 23 Taliban warriors locked in Kabul Prison. Tell the Press Office that all media should describe them as volunteers. What? Run, or they're all dead! Yes, sir! - Bae! - Yes? - Call a meeting quickly. - Yes, sir. - Check with foreign press. - Yes. If our request is not met by then, we'll kill the hostages. We give you 24 hours. KARACHI PRISON, PAKISTAN Come out! What is going on? Sign here. Park Dae-sik A hard stay, right? Three months. No, was it four? Can't even remember. Counterfeiting dollars was a bit extreme. Was it my decision? You said you'd pull me out quickly. Is this how the nation treats one who risks his life? You know counterfeiting is a sensitive issue here. Okay! Go to Kabul. Let's not see each other again. What's with your attitude? - People were kidnapped! - You take care of it. It's 23 people! Hurry! Hurry up! We will soon be landing at Kabul International Airport. The time in Kabul is 8:24 a.m., with a temperature of 31 degrees. Please fasten your seatbelts and return your tray tables to the upright position. Vice Minister. - Vice Minister! - Huh? We're landing. Please put on your seatbelt. Okay. KABUL, CAPITAL OF AFGHANISTAN 5 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE Welcome. How is it with the Afghan government? The ambassador is doing all he can, but they won't budge. Please come with me. What is it? He's an intelligence agent. Are you the negotiator? What's your strategy? They like to show they mean business, so send some positive signal before they kill someone. Understand? Isn't that the freak who was screwing around in Pakistan? Yes, sir. Didn't he get kicked out? Why is he here? I heard he helped deal with the Korean hostage incident in Iraq. But that hostage died. Intelligence officers are so scarce in this region... They must really be desperate for agents. AFGHAN FOREIGN MINISTRY Two days ago, two German deporters were kidnapped in the exact same area. I don't understand why the Koreans did not ask our government for protection. Especially when they are moving in such a large group. Tell him to stop lecturing and release those prisoners. The most important thing right now is to bring them back, right? Please release some Taliban prisoners in exchange for the Koreans, like you did last time for the Italian deporter. The Italian deporter again. That was a very exceptional case. And it was one person at that time. This time, there are many. Way too many. You are aware that the kidnappers asked us to withdraw the troops. Yes, I know. But the Korean troops were scheduled to go back at the end of the year anyway. They gave you a very easy task. We could postpone it. We could even consider sending more troops to expand the medical facilities and roads in Afghanistan. The Afghan Foreign Minister has decided to hold a press conference. Here's Director Jeong. How long do you think it'll take to exchange prisoners? It doesn't seem it will take too long. But America's stance is most important, so I think you should contact Washington. Got it. Good work. Yes, thank you! ROK EMBASSY ABDUCTION RESPONSE HQ Tell me the terms of the agreement. Did you not hear me? Look, don't you have any sense of procedure? Instead of just bursting in, go through official channels. I've got no use for that. Will they really release Taliban prisoners? The Afghans will never do a deal over the troop withdrawal. How do you know about that? That's a diplomatic secret sent over the hotline! Are you wiretapping us? I won't let this slide! What do you know about this country? People here grind their teeth at the mention of the Taliban. The president almost got sacked when he tried to release a few prisoners. You think he'll let 23 go free? Sir, it's starting. Hussein! Hussein! "We are working closely with the South Korean government to solve this hostage crisis." Will you accept the Taliban's demand to release the prisoners? "Under no circumstances will we release the Taliban prisoners." "The Afghan government is considering all other options to ensure that none of the Korean hostages are hurt." What are those bastards saying? Jeong, what's going on? It's from Seoul. Yes, Chief. Didn't you say you reached an agreement? It seems there was a misunderstanding. Yes, we'll get it cleared up soon. We've got one hour left! I know, but... The Afghan officials aren't picking up? What? Not yet... What's with this traffic? I'm losing my mind... Is there any shortcut? Should we try going through the alleys? Sure. Shit... Even more packed here. Hey, how much time is left? 40 minutes. Jeez. Let's take the opposite lane. Are you blind? Sorry, sorry! Slowly. Okay, let's go. - Are you crazy? - Are you blind? What is it now? How far is it? It's at the second intersection, on the corner. Vice Minister! There's no time, I think we should walk. But arriving on foot... Hurry, it's fine! Seriously? Allah is the Greatest! Is he still not picking up? Sir! Are you okay? Vice Minister, are you hurt? Hello? Director Jeong? We have 30 minutes left. What do you think will happen? I think they'll be killed. How do we stop them? Announce that we'll withdraw troops, and contact the OIC quickly. Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Changing our stance means admitting we made a mistake. If you look at the situation here, there is no other way. Minister! You announced a withdrawal? Are we giving in to terrorists after negotiations failed? What's the backdrop to this hasty decision? Minister! Director! The Taliban extended the deadline! What? - By how much? - 24 hours. Take good care of the Vice Minister. What? - Director! - Where are you going? Don't you think you should see a doctor first? I thought we had an agreement. Why did you back down? Don't be upset. We think it is very regretful that the Korean government had to give in to the Taliban's demand. We feel the same that the Afghan government broke our agreement! All you care about is getting the hostages released. But we have to keep fighting the Taliban, even after you leave. Please understand that for us, this is a very complicated decision. Listen to me. What does it take to release the prisoners? Aid? Or American consent? Answer me. Next time, there may be no extensions. Don't get desperate. This is exactly what the Taliban want. You sound like you don't care if they die. They are innocent people. Just civilians! You really believe they are innocent? Excuse me? Hello. Okay. I have a very urgent matter I have to attend to. - If you don't mind. - No, no! We are not done. A German hostage has been murdered. Next will be a Korean. Mr. Jeong. Do you believe what the Taliban really want is the prisoners' release? Are you saying there's something else? I think we already told you. Salaam. Do you know this guy? You seen him? - Salaam. - Salaam. Do you know this guy? Ask at the second floor restaurant across the street. Hurry up! Are you Qasim? What is he saying? Qasim is busy now. Qasim doesn't know Korean. Hey! Lee Bong-han! You know me? Come outside. If you're tired, move to a hotel. No, I have to hold down the fort. Are you okay? The Afghans said we could pay a ransom for the prisoners? Why didn't you tell me? Bargain with terrorists? Are you out of your mind? What did the Germans get for sticking to their principles? Their hostage was murdered! I'll report to the Minister. The world will see us as pushovers if word gets out! Our aim is to prevent killings, not protect our reputation! Everyone here knows that! Sit still for now. The intelligence service said they'll solve it in two days. Two days? We only have a day. What can the NIS do? The Jirga! The Jirga. The Jirga is a council of Afghan tribal leaders. In a practical sense, all issues in Afghanistan are decided by them. If they issue a decision, the hostages can be released without an exchange of prisoners. Currently, our elite agent and a local coordinator are making contact. What's wrong? What? Let's go. He says the mule must rest. Or you can pay another 10 thousand afghanis. What a crook. We're not even halfway there. This is the only road? Sure. I'm serious. Okay, 20 thousand. And another 20 if we get there before dark. Okay? Go. Dae-sik, you should pay him through me. Wait up! PASHTUN TRIBAL VILLAGE 19 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE Greetings. This man says he knows Ismael. They are Koreans. Smile. You know Ismael? Do I know him? I saved him by taking him to the Korean medical unit to get surgery after a bomb exploded. You did? Any friend of my nephew is my friend. But what brings you all the way here? He's asking why we're here. It's because of the Korean hostages. It's because of the Korean hostages. These people came all this way for volunteer work. And he brought this gift as a peace offering. It's the latest phone. Rotate to open. Rotate to close. See, they love anything made in Korea. How do you know about this? You think I'm here to play? You said there's no road. There isn't... it's all minefields. Damn you! I'm Jeong Jae-ho, representing Korean government. Nice to meet you. This is Jeong Jae-ho. He's a representative of the Korean government. Welcome. Come in. Hello, I'm Afghanistan's only Pashtun-Korean interpreter, Abdul Kareem Qasim... Qasim for short, just call me Qasim! You're a Korean? That's amazing. - I'll need your help, then. - Yes. What are you doing here? What? I am cooperating. Don't you dare butt in here. Step aside. I'll handle this my way. This place has its own rules. We don't have time for this. 23 lives depend on us. Sir, please calculate my fee separately. A professional negotiator like you is really in another class! A hospital in the chief's name, building a school... That's not class, it's cash. So a new mobile phone is more classy? You both work for the country, no need to bicker. Doesn't matter what path you take to get to the same place. And the phone did the trick. Nice job. Is he really a key figure within the Jirga? For sure. He's royal family. Royal family? Family lines are important in Islam. There are some families even the Taliban can't touch. So we need to win over that tribal chief. Korean! Join us. I think they're testing us. Wait. Don't underestimate their pride. If you refuse, they'll think you don't respect them. Have a smoke! That isn't tobacco, it's a strong strain of hashish. One more time! He says to smoke more, but don't do it. I'm fine! Great! Someone's coming... He said he'll help us. He said the hostages will be safe as we discuss the matter. They're helping us because they want to show that Islam respects honor and is welcoming to guests. JIRGA ASSEMBLY They decided to let them go. Really? For real? Wow! Great work, really! Thank you! I'll buy you a drink back in Korea! I'm not going back to Korea. I like this area. I like feeling I'm the only one between sky and earth. Hey! Listen up! They agreed to release the hostages! What kind of reaction is that? Anyway, my great translating and pretending to know Ismael played a big part. You're not friends with Ismael? One in three guys here is named Ismael. That tickles. Have you no fear, pulling a prank like that? Jeez... Now, let's settle the payment. FOREIGN MINISTRY Director. What? There's no plane that can take all 23 of them. Should I book a private plane? Who are they, Olympic gold medalists? Find some connecting flights! Yes, sir. What is it? So why do missionaries keep taking these reckless trips? If one dies on a mission... Don't just stand there. Call the TV station! Yes, sir! In fact, they all wrote their wills before flying to Afghanistan. Yes? This is the Foreign Ministry. Sorry? What you're broadcasting now is very dangerous. It could provoke the Taliban! How can I control their opinions? They aren't reading off a script. If something happens to the hostages, will you take responsibility? Stop the broadcast now! How can I cut off a live broadcast? The Taliban don't understand Korean, what's the problem? Sorry, I've got to go. We're broadcasting. No, go away. I'm sorry, but everything is settled. Swindler! Dae-sik, let's go! What is he saying? He's asking why we lied to them? What? He asked why we told them they were volunteers... Why are they on TV? Shit... Listen to me. They're not missionaries. You've got to insist they're volunteers, okay? This is unforgivable! Volunteers! Volunteers! They're not volunteers. Chief! We're not lying! The hostages are currently held in three groups, with the first eight scheduled for release tomorrow morning. The press conference will resume after a 10-minute break. What do you mean we have to pay the ransom? The negotiation failed! Every broadcast here is quoting Korean news, reporting that the hostages are missionaries. Is this true? Al Jazeera is broadcasting the Korean feed with subtitles. The Afghans will mediate the ransom payment. Is there no other way? It's the most realistic, preferable option now. Director Jeong, don't be so inflexible. Why don't you try negotiating through the Jirga one more time? It's over with the Jirga, Chief! Minister, you need to decide quickly. We'll discuss it, so just wait. Is that so? Okay, thanks. What is it? An Asian body has been found in Musheky. No, that can't be! Wait, what is it now? I have to go home! Let's go check. Shit... These people are from the Korean government. 5 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING For crying out loud... What's this? Wait! Vice Minister! I found this on a Taliban website. My name is Hong Mi-sook. I am Korean and I work as a nurse. This is my first time visiting Afghanistan. Everyone here is kind and treating us well. We are provided with a great meal and bed every day. I miss my family. I strongly urge the Korean government take more active steps to save its people. What did he say? He said they never asked for money. The only way for the Korean hostages to go home is the release of Taliban prisoners. We warn the Korean government. Persuade the Afghan government to release Taliban prisoners within 24 hours or we will kill more hostages. Mr. Negotiator, now what? All right, don't panic. The Taliban want us to panic. How can I not panic right now? Just give me a chance to think! Think? People are dying while you think! Watch your mouth! Have you gone mad? Hey, stop it! What are you doing? - One more. - Sure. Neither America, nor President Karzai will ever hand over the prisoners. There's only one way. Direct negotiation. Never. That's absolutely ridiculous. Why? Are you afraid to meet the Taliban? It figures... The dweeb who spends his life in an air-conditioned office would pee his pants when meeting the Taliban. Do you know what it means to sit at the same table as the Taliban? There is a Maginot line that can't be crossed in diplomacy. The moment a diplomat sits face to face with the Taliban, South Korea becomes a country that surrendered to terrorists. It would be a crushing diplomatic loss! Diplomacy... Mr. Diplomat, you can eat this. Then send me. I'll go. Why? You want to make up for what happened in Iraq? You think I do this for myself? Here's some personal advice. Just go back to Korea. Staying stuck in the past, roaming around this place that would drive anyone crazy. Save me! Please save me... It's all my fault... Watch, and then tell your government! I want to go home! No... Are you Mr. Park from South Korea Intelligence Service? Let me get this straight. So that broker persuaded the Taliban to change their list of prisoners, and we'll be able to get those inmates released? Yes, how many times do I have to tell you? Abdullah is no simple broker. He's a British businessman who dealt with the Taliban before the war, and has intervened in such kidnappings countless times. How do we get those inmates out of prison? An inside job. How is that possible, especially with the U.S. military against it? Since it's in Ghazni, it's possible. The central government has less control over that region. Jailbreaks happen often. How much does he want? Two million dollars. What? Mr. Abdullah, until now, the Taliban demanded we release 23 prisoners. Now suddenly, they changed the list? I don't understand. The Taliban also feel uncomfortable about these killings. As the clock is ticking, they are having internal disagreements. If given the chance, they prefer to negotiate. You are not Afghan. Why get involved? As someone who understands the Afghans, I truly want these Koreans to go back to their families. No trust. No deal. I'm wasting my time here. Just a moment, please. What's the problem? He's settled kidnapping cases? Then let's check with the British government. Everyone working here has fake names and nationalities. A background check will take too long. We have to go with our gut feeling. Please decide quickly. There's no time to sit and think. We need to properly check first! What if there's another victim? Will you take the blame? If she's ready, put her on the phone. Hello? Will this buy your trust? Two minutes. Hello? This is the Vice Foreign Minister. What's your name? I am Hong Mi-sook. Please help me! Yes, please stay calm. I'll ask you a few questions. How many are with you now? There are seven of us here. How many Taliban guards? Three? How's everyone's health? Not good, especially Hye-young, she's not eating at all. Where do you think you are now? Any recognizable terrain? I don't know. They keep moving us at night. Wait! Please just tell my family this. I'm sorry, and I love them. Just tell them that... Ms. Hong! Don't worry, you'll be able to tell them yourself. So? Now what? One hundred dollar bills. No consecutive serial numbers. Put them in two bags. Mix them up. Dae-sik, there's 100 here. As soon as we get the money, you get the prisoners. 4 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE Team A has arrived. GHAZNI CENTRAL PRISON Team B ready. Everyone stay alert, and let's finish this quickly. Where is Abdullah? Where's the money? Salaam! Now, release the prisoners. Should we count the money first? The prisoners first. Very well. It's me. Release the prisoners. Yes, Vice Minister. We counted 23 of them. It's done. This heat is killing me! What the...? What is it? What's wrong? Vice Minister, look at this. Director Jeong asked me to dig up more info on Abdullah. This is from the British Foreign Ministry, and it seems he's a fake. Abdullah, real name Peter Merchant. It says he died in Kuwait last year. Take the prisoners to this place. The Korean hostages will be there. May God be with you. Just a moment. Director Jeong! Don't give him the money! What? He's a fraud! Hands up. Put it down. Are you okay? I'm okay. Put it down! No, don't go! Don't follow them! No! Shit... Sorry. Take him out, quick! Hey! Investigate whether that NIS nut was in on this fraud! Find out how much he got paid! You should've checked if the Taliban got paid for allowing that call! You think you're here on vacation? You bastard. You won't get away with this! You're out to ruin us, aren't you? Please stop, sir. He's doing all he can. It's a Taliban general. Hussein. He wants to suggest something very important to the Korean government now. "Transfer $100,000 to the foreign account by this afternoon. Then we'll release 30 Koreans." He's saying he'll release 30 Koreans. 30? Not 23, but 30? Fake Taliban, petty crime inmates, a fraud broker... Damn! Hello? This time, he says he's the Taliban commander. He said the deadline has already passed. First he's a general, now he's a commander? Translate this word for word! If he calls one more time, he won't get away with it! My name is Park Sung-jin. Born August 1973. I live in Ojeong-dong, Bucheon. Mr. Park Sung-jin! Tell him it's a misunderstanding. We need more time! Translate now! Please meet these people's demands! Then we can live. Please save me! Whatever it takes, we will find a way to release the prisoners! Hurry! We gave enough time, but you kept wasting time. Hurry and tell them! I want to live! Please save me! Mr. Park, say "Nanawatai". Protection! Fairness! Mercy of the Pashtun people! - Allah is the Greatest! - No! Next time, bring me the right answer. The next deadline is tomorrow at 4 o'clock. Welcome, Minister. I'm Secretary Cha Min-yong. I'm ashamed to make you come so far, Minister. The Taliban have warned the Korean government that there will be further killings. In response, the Foreign Affairs minister has made a visit to the Afghan President Karzai. Will the Korean government's new negotiation strategy be able to satisfy the Taliban without causing any friction to the South Korean-Afghan relations, and effectively prevent the Taliban from further killings? Yes? What happened? They launched a military operation! What are you talking about? The military have mobilised in Ghazni, and there are concerns that the joint military exercise will provoke the Taliban... So this is the plan the Minister brought? Vice Minister. Is it true that we're launching a military operation? Just a normal operation. This is a sensitive time, it can provoke the Taliban! We need to stop this right now! How can we stop soldiers from training on the battlefield? It's not... We're preparing for the worst. If they kill any more hostages, there will be a rescue operation. Minister, the U.S. military's attacks in that area have failed for years! So should we just sit back and watch the hostages die? We're not done negotiating yet. President Karzai gave a final refusal to release the prisoners. What? Director Jeong, start packing. You've done enough. Your work is done here. - Minster! - I'll take care of it, so go home. Then what will happen to the captives? Minister! The U.S. Army commander is on the line. What did he say? How did it go? I've been ordered home. What? So you're just going to walk away? And the captives? You're going to let them die? Hey! I feel bad seeing you leave after all the trouble you went through. I'll come visit you when I'm back in Seoul. Thank you for your efforts. Great work. Let's hear what they have to say. Hong Mi-sook is my wife and a mother of two children. Please bring her back safely. Please help my wife Hong Mi-sook to return home safely. Please! Honey, you must be so tired. Hold on. Hello? This is Jeong Jae-ho from Afghanistan. I'd like to speak to the Chief Presidential Secretary. He's in a meeting now, so if you tell me... This is a very urgent matter, so please connect me. He can't answer the phone right now. If I don't talk to him now, you'll regret it! Director of Foreign Ministry? So what? Director Jeong, what is it? Mr. Secretary. Let me negotiate face-to-face with the Taliban. I'll try to persuade them myself. Did they change their conditions? No, but face-to-face negotiations are our last chance now. I know how you feel, but Minister Choi is there now, so follow his orders. Director, you'll be late for your flight. Hello! This is Jeong Jae-ho! This is the President. You really think there's a chance? Everyone says it's impossible. Is it possible? It's a long shot. But Mr. President, I can't give up. I'm told we can't guarantee your safety. Will you still go? Yes. You can come back alive? I'll try my best. My fellow Koreans. 1 HOUR BEFORE DEADLINE You must be anxious at the news of a second victim among our people kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan. I emphasize, we are willing to use any means possible to ensure the prompt and safe return of our citizens. Director Jeong, do you know what you've done? Our president just sent an open invitation to negotiate with the terrorists! You know better than anyone what a stain this is on our diplomacy! As far as I know, our first duty is to protect our citizens. If I am mistaken, please tell me. We have a message from the Taliban. The hostages are safe, and if we send a team, they'll negotiate with us. The expected point of contact is near Mijan, northeast of Kandahar Province. The U.S. military will provide protection up to the meeting spot. It's said they want $1M for a US prisoner, and $1.5M for an Italian photographer. We've got a lot of people. This is highly confidential. Thank you so much. KIDNAPPING LOCATION How many vehicles for that day? - Two cars, eight in total. - Okay. Javeed Nurul Haq. Considered a top-level terrorist even among the Taliban. It's a group that the CIA are keen to capture. This is quite terrible. He's a notorious figure even among the Taliban. Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim? - Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim? - I'm here! Dae-sik! Move! Dae-sik, buddy! Can you please get me out of here? No wonder I couldn't reach you. You couldn't stay out of trouble? It was a misunderstanding. Should I give you a chance to get out? Please. As a fellow Korean, please? - Then translate for me. - Of course, whatever you... Where are we going? - To the Taliban. - The Taliban? Have a safe trip. I'll just stay here. It's to save people. I should risk my life to save theirs? What nonsense. Bye! It's probably better than getting flogged. Flogged? Gambling, drinking, swindling. You did the full set. Under Sharia law, you'll get whipped dozens of times. Can you take that? It hurts. It already hurts. Let's talk outside. 10 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING Are you ready? What? You being nice is awkward. Since I may never see you again. It's a joke. You know how to joke? Why aren't you wearing this? They'll think I'm scared. I won't give them the upper hand. Pride won't protect you from bullets. Thanks. No bathroom breaks during the negotiation. I can't even drink water? They're coming. I heard you were a church deacon. Why does that matter when I'm facing death? I'll pray to the local god. What is he saying? Go on. Huh? Go. Me? Why'd they have to come here and cause so much trouble? Will you be okay? With what? Not calling your family. Wow, you really must have wiretapped us. You know who I envy the most? Someone with a place to go back to. They said only the negotiator and interpreter can come. I don't think I need this. Let's go. Wait. Pop this with your molars in one bite. Hey. I'm good. Hey! Where are we going? Shut up. Where are we going? Director, how far are we going? I am Jeong Jae-ho, the negotiator representing the Korea government. I'm here to negotiate the hostage issue. He says it's nice to meet you. He asks if you brought the answer. What are you doing? These people are quick-tempered. First, ask them to show us the condition of the Koreans. - Bring the monitor. - Yes. He says now that you've checked, let's start talking. - There's one more thing. - What is it now? As I'm here on behalf of the Korean government, you should prove you are the leader of this negotiation. This guy is a bit particular. What can he do to make you believe him? Tell him to release three of the hostages first. - What? - Translate, now! Dammit, this... He says you're tricking them! If you let them go now, Muslims all over the world will be proud of you. He said he'll let two go. That it's a gift from Allah. Hold on. We have to check for explosives. What the hell are you saying? Over here! Oh, god! Ms. Kim Hye-young? Ms. Kim? Come here. Come here! Hello? How did it go? Kim Hye-young and Lee Jin-hee are safe with us. Okay. He says it's our turn. What are you doing? Come on, say something! There will be no release of prisoners. What? You said you brought the answer. This is our answer. If he wants to proceed, tell him to change the conditions. I can't. We'll die if I say that. What did he say? Tell us now! Okay, I'll tell you. This will only weaken your bargaining power! He said he'll do the negotiation his way. He told them to kill that woman. Sir, won't you do something? Stop! Wait. I will ask our government. They're changing their conditions. He said to free all Taliban prisoners by midnight tonight. Let me confirm that. All of the Taliban prisoners? That's correct. If we don't, they'll kill a hostage every hour. 300 prisoners? They had no intention of negotiating in the first place. Let's go to Bagram Air Base. Please wait a little longer! Who do you think you are? We sent Jeong Jae-ho as our negotiator! Shouldn't we give him that slim chance and wait? If we start bombing now, the negotiator is in most danger. I think it's time, why aren't they calling? They won't. Why? Wait a minute... They said the Korean government broke off the negotiation. What'll happen to us? We never should have given them a chance! You tricked us. No! The Allies have launched a military campaign. What? He said to stop lying. They've got 21 hostages, so the Allies can't carry out a rescue operation. Why did he say 21? Two got released, it should be 19... This isn't a rescue operation, this is a mop-up operation! The U.S. and Afghan forces just needed an excuse to level this place. When the operation starts, the hostages, you and your men, and us too will all die! Are a few of your men more important than saving many lives? You yourself provided the excuse for this bombing. Know that! I know what you are thinking. You come here to save those people. You don't just let them be killed. Tell your government to stop the attack. We don't have the power. Koreans aren't our guests. You sent the troops here! You are an extremely rich country. You can do whatever you want. You may be a good commander, but you are nothing as a negotiator. You know your biggest mistake? You overestimated us. Allah is the only god. Muhammad... Muhammad is the only prophet. It's the price of breaking down this deal. I will send you the hell first! The only way to stop the bombing is to tell them we have a deal. We are not afraid of American missiles! Time is on our side. So is Allah. Eventually, we are going to win this war. Why take things so far? You know better than anyone, the prisoner exchange is impossible! Why do you think? Money. Money? You have insulted us! Take him out! Take him too! He told them to take me too! Director, what do I do? These American bastards! Allah is the Greatest! 50 million. 40. 20. Remember, Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. Send all the troops home. Make all Koreans leave Afghanistan in a month, for good. Okay? Okay. Never set your foot again in this country, Korean. Hello? The negotiation is done. They'll release all the hostages. Call the Americans. Good work! Director Jeong? Nice work everyone. We've reached a deal! You can go back to Korea now. Thank you. I take back my comment on you being a dweeb. Great work. No, thank you. I really wouldn't have been able to do it without you. What's this? They said one has to stay behind. What are they talking about? They guaranteed our safety up to here, so they want to ensure their safety too. We're done negotiating, what is this? He said if we don't do it, no one can leave here. I'm the representative of this negotiation, so I'll stay. Then as the person in charge, lead them safely back to Korea. It's my turn now. Don't worry. My luck is good. I will stay. Let him go. Get it together! Be sure to see the director off. You did well, Lee Bong-han. Go. Take care of yourself, brother. "If I break this agreement and disclose anything about my work here, I agree to be punished according to the law..." Pretty straightforward, right? Thank you. We work ourselves to death, and are left with nothing. 21 people came back alive. That's true. The 21 former hostages abducted in Afghanistan on September 19 have just landed at Incheon Int'I Airport. The safety of one anonymous team member who remained with the Taliban after the deal has also been confirmed. This marks an end to the largest hostage crisis in Korea's history. 3 MONTHS LATER The Minister's at the press conference, but we still haven't figured it out? What do you even do? Find out now! Hello, who is this? You didn't go to Washington? Or maybe you couldn't? Park Dae-sik? You son of a... So quick to swear at me! Where are you now? Why didn't you call? You know how worried I was? You weren't hurt? I told you. My luck is good. Is that Director Jeong? Me, me! Hold on, someone wants to say hi. Huh? Director Jeong... Salaam! Have you been well? Oh, Qasim! Lee Bong-han! There must really be no one there. Working with Qasim again? Last time in Afghanistan, I don't think I got fully paid... You little... Director Jeong, come quickly. Anyway, take care of yourselves. Let's get in touch soon. Take care and... I won't say see you later. Don't want to get into another mess. Park Dae-sik. Everyone has a place to go back to. You know, right? Peace be upon you. Did he say he'll pay? No? Always talking about money... Let's go! At 8:43 a.m. today, our government confirmed that Marine Star 1 from Dongin Shipping Co. Of Busan was kidnapped in waters off the Indian Ocean, 300 km from the port of Kismayo, Somalia. The hijacked ship carrying a total of 25 people is believed to have been hijacked by Somali pirates armed with portable rockets. We are holding an emergency diplomatic and security meeting to discuss countermeasures, and a response team will be sent as soon as possible.
