Of all the girls in the world, why did I fall in love with Jessie? Presenting, Jessie. Beautiful... classy... intelligent... class topper... 98.9 percent... and sexy... 100 percent. Even in a saree, she can give any fashionably dressed girl a complex. I'd take her home right now... Give her the hundred and eleven rupees as per the tradition... and make her mine. So what's the problem? The problem is that she is getting married today. Jessie, by the rules of god, and by the grace of this church... With a free mind, and with complete acceptance... Do you take Roy Thomas to be your husband? To someone else... not to me. Sir, what do you want? Nikhil, the A.D, is my friend. There's no Nikhil here. Hey Sachin! Sorry dude. What is this, Nikhil? No one knows you here! - Forget it, three Khans are shooting here. - I've been waiting for half an hour. I told you about him. This is me, Sachin. I'm an engineer. I even work as one, but I can't keep a job. I can't keep a job, because my heart isn't into it. My heart is into cinema. I want to make movies. I used to watch movies. Now I want to make them. I didn't even realize when cinema became my life. Nor did I realize when it became my problem 1. A lot of friends... a lot of dreams... and hope... such was life. Anay sir, you're late. Anyway good you're here. Not today. I've got to jog today. - Come on, sir! - My arm is hurting. Such a well-known cameraman and you refuse cricket. Films and cricket, what more is there to India?! You always play with my emotions, Sachin Tendulkar. Sir, most assistant directors are related to actors or producers. I don't stand a chance. Whom will you assist? Sir, Anurag Kashyap? With him, your life will become dark. He's a good chap though. It's your first movie... try something fresh. Ramesh Sippy. Rohan Sippy? His father, Ramesh Sippy. The Ramesh Sippy! I'm the cameraman for his movie. You'll learn a lot. You'll get to work on a big, colorful movie. You know, Sholay, Shakti...getting it? Right here. Bungalow apartment in Juhu? Holy mother of God! How come? My dad's brains. Redevelopment and all. Really! We've been here just a week. It's not even our own! You'll get your own house as well. For now, enjoy Juhu. Bachchan sir's bungalow to the left, my office to the right. Drop by whenever you feel like. Your dad seems quite smart. I don't get why he doesn't support your film-making. That's what, sir! What do I do? We'll figure something out. First, lunch. Mr. Anay... we're among those people who... live simply and sleep soundly. Yes, sir. We don't even watch movies. The last movie we saw was Sholay. Sholay? There's been no real movie made after that.. Yes, true. What a coincidence! This is magic, sir. I've recommended him to Ramesh Sippy, the director of Sholay. His comeback film. His future is bright, sir. What can I say! Can you put that on stamp paper? Sir, he's definitely capable. I don't think so. Sir, I know him well. He's got potential. I'm his father. I also have some idea of his potential. Of course you do. But, being a friend... I see a story-teller in him. Everything seemed so difficult. Life was a mess. That's when I saw Jessie. You can think everything else through, but love... just happens. Just like that. Takes over your world... just like that. Just one glance, and it pours straight into your heart. Abracadabra... whoosh... smile... calm... magic...music... and in a flash... in a flash... in a flash. You are in love. I live upstairs. "If I had two hearts in me". "Even the other heart". "I would have given". "It to you, to be broken". What are you doing, Sachin? What's going on? Dad...I'm writing a romantic scene. Here, like this, dancing in the middle of the road? I'm getting the feel right. What feel, you idiot? Everyone's looking! "Hosanna". "Hosanna". "Hosanna". "Hosanna". "The first initiative with you was a captivating one". "That one where I first spotted you". "I am so lost that I don't even know where to go if I wish to". "Hosanna the moment you were in front of me". "Hosanna, the next moment you Disappeared". "Now what do I tell about my state". "Here there and everywhere, I just search for my consciousness". "Hosanna, this inebriated love". "Hosanna, my union with you". "Hosanna, now this is my love". "Hosanna". "Everybody want to know be like be like". "I really want to be here with you "Is that enough to say that". "We are made for each other is all that is hosanna true". "Hosanna is there when you are calling I will be there". "Hosanna feeling like my life s changed". "I never want to be the same". "Its time was arranged I take a step". "You take a step and me calling out to you". "Hello, hello hello, hosanna". "Hosanna, hosanna" - Mom, I'm home. What's there to eat? "Hosanna" "Hosanna" "The shadows of a flying butterfly remain on the flower". "The same way you are like a portrait that's in my eyes". "Hosanna that you are in my dreams". "Hosanna, then why will my heart not be Impatient". "What do I tell you about me being a lover". "Why do I keep thinking of you every moment". "Hello, hello, hello". "Hosanna, whether it's day or the night". "Hosanna, my heart wishes you be here". "Hosanna let my hands be in your hands". "Hosanna, "If I had two hearts in me". "Even the other heart". "I would have given". "It to you, to be broken". "If I had two hearts in me". "Even the other heart". "I would have given". "It to you, to be broken". She's a Malayali Christian. Jessie. Madrasi right? Are all south Indians Madrasis? She's from Kerala. Isn't it the same thing? Tell me more. We're Marathi Konknastha Brahmins. You remember that, right? So? Nothing can happen. You'll get beaten up. Okay. What okay? Have you seen how tall her father is? I was 100 percent sure that violins would start playing in you heart. Really? I'm proud of you. You should be. Even if you get her to like you, nothing can happen. Believe me. And her father's a lawyer. Same speed, same speed. Come here, Valentine! Dude, sisters are crazy. I mean, they're the little good daughters. Okay? Never listen to them. In love, listen to your heart, not your sister. What does your heart say? "Jessie, Jessie" right? So, now all we have to think about is how to approach Jessie... and how to propose to her. That's all. Focus. Focus okay, sir. I wasn't talking to you, dude. Anything else? Another shocker. This one will bowl you out for sure. What? And you finished engineering last year. So? That's good. What's wrong? See, this is why you'd fail in Math. Dude, she's a year older than you. What are you saying? She doesn't look a day older than 18. Yeah, you wish, brother. A year older. And a Christian. Problem 2. She's a year older than you? - Yes sir. You're lucky. In my town in U.P., there's a saying... "The older the bride, the more luck she brings." And I think it applies to Maharashtra too. U.P. Maharashtra are the same! All girls know the tricks of love. But, if she's a year or two elder... then she'll show a little more care in the love. Baby...sweetheart... all the mushy stuff. And such girls, they take care of everything, I mean everything. Sir!? So don't worry. Not me, sir. Jessie will worry. That's the art my friend. You shouldn't let Jessie worry. Art of loving. Who the hell is she? She's mine. Hi, I'm Jerry. Hello problem 3. - Sachin. - Jessie's brother. He spells trouble. Hello. This is my house. I know. You're Jessie's dad. You know Jessie? Yes. I mean, he's my friend. Oh. You mean Jerry. Oh your son's name is Jerry. Okay, yeah, Jerry. What do you do? I... Mechanical engineer. Good. Very good. Thank you, sir. Come home someday. It is your house, yet...do come. Sure. Problem 4. Seems quite big. Sir, how tall are you? What? Height? 6' 3". Amitabh Bachchan is also the same. Who's Amitabh Bachchan? He lives right here, sir. Oh. Neighbor. Neighbor. How can you live in such a dirty room? Mom, please. Okay, listen... your dad's upset. He thinks you're wasting time. Yes, mom. He wants to talk to you. Be home in the evening. Who's come over, Mom? Sounds just like Lata Mangeshkar. Oh shut up. It's the landlord's daughter. Oh, from upstairs. Stay away! Mom, you know my taste. A superb move by my sister! She got Jessie home. After redevelopment, it'll be three instead of two bedrooms. I think it'll be nice. Hey, Jessie. This is my brother. Hello. Hi. I'm Sachin. I know. Your mom keeps calling your name all day. Sachin this...Sachin that... I can hear it upstairs. Yeah! So even you figured out that... I'm jobless. No. No. I didn't mean that. I know. How come your Hindi is so good? In fact, it's better than my Malayalam. Since when are you... in Mumbai? Born here, brought up here. Don't be all formal with me. But Kerala... is such a beautiful place. I've been there so many times. You get good steam cakes... toddy and... of course... Mohanlal. Who's Mohanlal? The father hasn't heard of Bachchan, and the daughter, of Mohanlal. What can I say! He's one of my favorite actors. Well, there's a lot more to Kerala than toddy and Mohanlal. Yeah true. I know. I know. Where's your house in Kerala? Pulinkunnu. Alleppey. I mean, my parents are from Pulinkunnu. Pulu... Gosh, such tough names! I mean... Do you go to Kerala often? My grandmother stays there. I do go to meet her once a year. She's so cute. I really like it there. I mean, how could you study Math? I like Math. It's so difficult! When you love something... ...it becomes simple. Even I like Math. But Math doesn't seem to like me. I know. You're an engineer, right? Mechanical. It was pointless. My brother wants to make movies. He wants to be a film-maker. Really? Yeah? Yes. I mean... Now I'm just thinking. One day, I'll do it. It's a little tough. Tougher than Math. But when you love something... it becomes simple. You know I've watched only five movies ever. Really? Why? Dad didn't let me. Which ones? I don't remember. But why? It's considered a sin amongst us. Against religion. I mean, my dad follows all this very strictly. Brother... get lost. Yes...I'll head out. I've to go to the bank, to deposit a check. I'll see you... Bye. Later. What a shocker! She should at least watch movies! My entire world fell apart, in a moment. The 'Follow her' formula. Never fails. There's a McDonald's near Jessie's office. So she will definitely come here sooner or later. Hi. Hi. A chicken burger for you. I'll have a veg burger. Jessie, should I order a burger for you? Yeah, I'll have a chicken burger. Okay, fine. Are you following me? Nah. And you? My office is near here. I work here. I don't work here. I am jobless. Filet-O-Fish... my favorite. Your order ma'am. It's not made at home. I just simply asked. No... thank you. So, what do you do? Program analyst with Syntel. You'll have something? No, thanks. I'll help myself. Okay! Okay, see you. Yeah bye. May I take your order? Your order, sir. Sir, your order please. Let me look at her, brother. Sir, place the order and look all you want! Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Office? No, cricket. Want to play, Sachin...Tendulkar? Humour eh? Good. You're hot. Sorry? It's very hot today. Eh... hot! Blue really suits you. Thank you. Is someone coming? Someone might. Who? My dad. And he'll kill me if he sees me with you. What are you saying? Really? How old are you? 22. Oh okay. That's fine. I'll say you're like my kid brother. I'm 23. I mean, if he does see me with you. Look, I'm not a brother to you all right! Actually, you're right. I already have a brother. One painful brother is enough. No no no. Any girl in the world can be my sister, but not you. Why not? Because, I think I love you. I'm in love with you, Jessie. I...I can't help it. Man! Why did I rush it? You won't find a bigger idiot! Now what do I do? Apologize? But to whom? Where is Jessie? Sachin! What? She's gone to Kerala. What? How do you know? Her mother told me. She's off to see her grandmother. For seven days. I've seen you circling the house all the time. Your neck must be sore too, no! So save it. She's gone to Alleppey... and that's not in Madras. My sister kept blabbering and I'd already reached Kerala. If Sunny Deol could take a truck all the way to Pakistan... why couldn't I go to Kerala? A swipe of Anay sir's credit card... and we were on a flight to Kerala. I'm here for my own sake, not yours. No cameraman can blow the chance to come to Kerala. Sachin, like I am there for you today... someone was there for me once. Besides, it's fun to see you in love buddy. You look cute like this. We've already circled Alleppey four times! Find another Jessie, please. Call up your lovely sister. Tell her to go upstairs... sweet talk Jessie's mother and... get her Kerala address somehow. How's that possible, sir? Kid sisters are good at such things. Please. We'll drop dead otherwise. I'm in my forties now... my knees will give way. I don't know why I'm saying this. Sachin, in love, always be a tiger, or a cheetah. Jessie will surely be yours. Anay sir. What is it? Sir, I had an idea. What if we add a dash of Einstein's brains to the tiger? Have you lost it, Sachin? Sir... Sir, I mean... I've racked my brains. Today's Sunday. So? Sir, Jessie's Christian. Today is mass. Jessie will surely go to the church. Sachin, there are more churches than homes in Kerala. I don't wake up early on Sunday even if there's a tsunami, please. Sir, Jessie will go to the biggest and the best church right? Let's go, sir. And we can find harmony too. Please. Harmony... Who is she? What if she isn't here either? This is the most famous church... she'll definitely come. How are you so sure? Detailing, sir. Cinema needs detailing. Is that so? You'll tell me about detailing! What? Look, sir. Holy mother of God! This is Jessie Really? Why? No, I mean she's fantastic! How could you be so lucky? Messages come in and messages go... Why're you singing a song from Border? You're here to attack or to love? Sir, to attack, with my love. Sir... She'll turn back... in 10 seconds. Oh yeah? You're quite the psychic! No, sir. I'm like Shahrukh Khan from Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Tick tick one... tick tick two... tick tick three... tick tick four. - Holy mother of God! - Didn't I tell you, sir! That's really something, you lovesick puppy. My Shahrukh Khan. Come on, let's get out of here. Let's go. - Sir, wait. - Let's go. Come on. Let's go. She'll come and talk to you. Anay sir, Jessie's here. Didn't I tell you? What are you doing here? I...Well, I came to apologize. I mean... I rushed it... 'I love you'. I thought you'd be upset. I mean, I felt bad as well. You disappeared. I figured you're here, so I came too, to apologize. I'm sorry, Jessie. Jessie. Okay, fine. You're my classmate, okay? That's what I'll say. Please. My granny's here. Jessie, Anay sir. Big cameraman. Nice to meet you, sir. Just a friend. Okay. Jessie, who are they dear? This is my friend, Sachin. My classmate. Classmate? Such a big man is your classmate? You got that eh? No no, childhood friends. All three of us. I'm Jessie's classmate. Come, come... - Who is it, Jessie? - This is my uncle George. Sachin, my classmate. - Oh Hello. - Hello. - Jessie's Uncle. - Roy, come. Uncle Roy. Sister, Reena. Sachin, my classmate. This is also an uncle. So many of them? Aunt Anjali. My cousins. Beyond this river is our house... come there with Jessie, have lunch and go. Food, food. Eat food, eat food. What are you doing? Jessie, come with them. Okay. Just tell them and come. - Bye. - Childhood friend. I'll come over then, are you sure? It's okay. Come. You'll have to take the boat. Ask for Kalipurackal house. - Kalipurackal. - Kalipurackal. Kalipurackal house. Very keen on lunch eh? What a family, sir! Go over to apologize and they invite you to lunch. Hello. Uncle George is the key. Get him on your side, and your life will be set. No problem getting here? Grammar's right? Come. Are you a Christian? Hindu, from Mumbai. I just asked simply... A lot of Jessie's friends come here. Is it? The last time Jessie was in Kerala, 20 friends were here. Grammar's right? Yes, sir. '20 friends came' is correct Hindi. Yes. Got it. Heard what the midget said? 20 boys have followed her here. - Friends, sir! - Right...right. Have you come to this side before? He's asking if you've come here before. One time before this. I do know a little Hindi. Correct? Yes, yes. You do. Eat, eat... Are you Jessie's classmate? Hmm. Oh okay... So you like Mathematics as well? Hmmm. - Correct? - Yes, sir. This is the best fish curry. What's your job? Sorry? Job, job. My job? Cinema, sir. Photography? Camera? Mammooty? - Eat, eat... - Sorry sir... no mathematics. Even he has a problem with cinema. He won't hit me, right? The midget is much stronger than he looks. Out...out...sir... digestion. After eating, walking, sir. Eat, eat... You too, sir. We have fried fish, fish curry, mutton curry. Eat, eat... You know what, this time I'll travel alone by train. Train travel has its own charm. Why are you here? I told you already. I thought you'd be angry. I am angry. Let it go, Jessie. Don't stop talking to me. These things happen. Don't take it too seriously. I don't take you seriously. But I do. Actually... it was too fast then. I agree. But, it's been ten days since. Now, I'm crazy about you. I swear Jessie, I haven't felt like this for 22 years in Mumbai. Now... there's just you... you and you. I wanted to tell you this as well. I couldn't stay away for a second, Jessie... neither could Anay sir. Without you. Drama Queen! Don't...don't waste your time, Sachin. It's pointless. Why? Firstly, love marriage. And you... you're a Hindu. And I'm a good person. Dad will never agree. But... And I don't want to elope. I can't go against my dad. And you know what? I've lived in Mumbai for 23 years. So I'm a year older than you. Me... older than you. And that too is a problem. All that doesn't matter nowadays. Look, I should like you too, right? That's important as well. Yes, that's right. It's very important. All right... so let's be friends first. Let love go take a hike. Okay? Okay. We'll talk when we feel like, meet when we feel like. Friends? Yes, right approach. Let's shake on it. You're not afraid of flying. Don't try to fool me. You both aren't even just friends, all right! Now you'll keep trying to get her under the guise of friendship. It's all a sham! Once a Romeo, always a Romeo. Correct, sir. 'Correct sir'! Why don't you continue your drama back in Mumbai? I'll get bored all alone on the flight. Anay sir, you leave. I need to focus, in the train. Focus! "Oh yes, what is this". "These eyes, these eyes". "These eyes, which are deep like the oceans". "Bending". " Whirling". "Those shying eyes, these eyes". "The capital of my dreams". "All...the lighting insects...the stars". "They have all learned to shine from the star" "Oh...ho...ho". "This girl is like a flower". "This girl is like an angel, isn't it". "Like an innocent one, all lost". "This girl is like a doe". "So soft and delicate is this girl". "This beautiful girl". 'Soft and sensuous, is this girl". "As your dress goes flying in the air". "So does my heart go flying along with it". "It just goes on beating and beating". "When I feel the longings for you". "It just stays deep inside my heart and mind". "The beautiful fragrance of your tresses". "That's where I wish to belong". "All your pains and all my happiness now belong to us, both". "It looks as though two hears, this girl". "This girl is like an angel, isn't it". "Like an innocent one, all lost". "This girl is like a doe". "So soft and delicate is this girl". "This beautiful girl". 'Soft and sensuous, is this girl". "You are on the Moon, I am on Earth". "Come a little bit near". "Come and reside in my heartbeats". "I am singing songs about You". "These desires of Yours". "Are there in my heart". Yes, it's you, it's you". "This girl is like a flower". "This girl is like an angel, isn't it". "Like an innocent one, all lost". "This girl is like a doe". "So soft and delicate is this girl". "This beautiful girl". 'Soft and sensuous, is this girl". How did you even dare to touch me? Dare to hold my hand? On the train. You said we're just friends. Is this how friends behave? After that I kissed you also. On the train, Jessie. And you didn't stop me. We are so good... Oh, I didn't stop you. That's why it happened? I'm sorry, Sachin. It's my fault. That's not what I meant. I shouldn't have even talked to you on the train. Please sit, Jessie. Please Jessie. Yes, I said we're friends... will always be. But, I saw you on the train and forgot all of it Jessie. It was just love. Right now, you're sitting there, and I'm here. But I feel like I should be there, with you, next to you. Jessie we have this amazing chemistry. Can't you feel it? Look, this is...this is love Jessie. That's it. I'm crazy about you... I am mad about you. We need to talk, stay here. There's no love, no chemistry... Yes, we did kiss. I don't know why. You are sitting across the table... not with me, not next to me. I'm just plain angry, that's all. Sachin... my sister did the exact same thing. Even then, there were only tears and fights. My dad made me swear I wouldn't do something like that. Do you like me or not, Jessie? That's all I need to know. You handle the love... I'll handle everything else. Sachin, I like you. But I don't want all these problems. It's simple. Do you get it? Bye. What? Don't go. Jessie. "Jessie feels something is crazy". "Jessie feels something is crazy". The budget for the party has been reduced to half. I was this close to victory. Otherwise we'd be sipping Scotch at the Marriott, not here in Woodcan. Hmm. So she's said 'I lo'... but not 've you'. Sir, you're a genius! How does that matter? I missed the fine scotch. Girls! That's what. She likes me but won't fall in love. Correct. I'm such an idiotic Romeo... who had to find this Juliet among all the women in Mumbai! Of all the girls in the world, why did I fall in love with Jessie? These beautiful girls... screw with men's heads. Tell me... is she worth it? I can give up my life for her, sir. That's that then. Love is great! Cheers to that. Get him a Coke. Here I am down in the dumps... and there she is, fresh as a dew drop... in the middle of the day! Isn't she just a little too beautiful? I wonder why she's called me here. What is it going to be now? Hi Sachin. Hi. Shall we go? Are you sure? You want to watch a movie? We can watch it till the interval. Then we can go someplace and talk. What? Up to the interval? Life's become so boring, Sachin. To work and home, everyday. And today, I wanted to meet you. Really? Yeah. I told my dad that I have to work late today. Overtime. I lied to him. Are you watching the movie? Is it any good? Or can we talk? It's good... but we can talk as well. Sachin, can we be in this without love? We should just stay friends. Forget about the movie, let's go. You know, Sachin... you... I mean... you were my first kiss. I've never even been on a date before. Drop me off here. "Why this excuses when we are friends". "Why do hide the fact". "That we love eachother". Jessie, wait. You're saying there's nothing going on here? Let's be in this without love? How? On one hand you tell me I was your first kiss... and then you say we're just friends! You sit four inches away on the bike... to avoid even a touch, right? Jessie, I want to make love to you all the time. Sachin, don't talk like that. Okay? - What's wrong? - What do I do? Call myself a friend? Or live the truth you refuse to see? Jessie, we choose friends. But Love chooses us. And this Love didn't give me any choice. n one second I could only fall in love. Nothing else. You're scared of your dad... yet you want to see me. Right? What about us seems like friendship, Jessie? Nothing! Tell your dad that Sachin, from downstairs, loves me. He'll keep me happy. He's more than a good friend. He's my world. He could give up his life for me. And that's why I want to spend my life with him. Please Jessie. Beg, plead, cry, stop eating for a while. Your dad will come around. Anyway, your dad has changed. He will come around. Such a tall, hefty man... he must have some sense. Even she's a big problem. How did I forget? I've seen her back more Than her front. Not that I was complaining. Such a beautiful problem. Problem 5. "Wow!" "When they mount". "Pain of god'. "Let's go now". "We'll take you on a building". "Hey". "You just left me all alone". "In the dark". "When you have to leave me". "What you gave me". "All that what". "Yeh, yeh I am shattered now". "Feeling so bad at now". "I am trying to walk in some fun group". "But this isn't working somehow". "You should be here Zazala". "Shooting guns making dance". "You should be here Gazala. "Smoking pipes at Binhala". "Now all this morning, you help me to forget". "All this pain of God". "Pain of God". "Why this excuses when we are friends". "That we have love for one another". "Why do we hide the fact". "Why this excuses when we are friends". "That we have love for one another". "Why do we hide the fact". "You just left me all alone". "In the dark". "You just left me all alone". "In the dark". "You took your time and walked inside my heart". "Baby it's not a game". "You make it up and break it up and break it up again and again". "You walked inside my heart". "You break it up again, again". "Say no, say no lie, I hate just another name". "Say no, say no lie, I hate just another name". I don't know what's on your mind, but we don't have another name". "Why this excuses when we are friends". "That we have love for one another". "Why do we hide the fact". "Why this excuses when we are friends". "That we have love for one another". "Why do we hide the fact". "Hey". "You just left me all alone". "In the dark". "You did this to me". "You did this to me". "Girl I loved you". 'When you were on the phone". 'Girl I loved you". "On the bed when we moved". "Girl I loved you". 'Every second on the ground". "Girl I loved you". "Even more when I'm gone". Jessie... I don't want to talk to you, Sachin. I've been serenading you for a whole month now. At least talk to me. Jerry saw you outside my office. It will become a problem. I'm telling you. I swear, I will not do anything to Jerry. Just talk to me... No... Please go.. please. Sachin... why are you here? I didn't come to meet you. I'm here for the breeze... ...on the terrace. I come every day. Where can you find a terrace in Juhu? Bungalow, terrace. Jess... Jessie. Sorry. H... hello... Tell me. Yes. No. Yes. Oh God! No... I'm just enjoying the breeze... on the terrace. No, no. Yes, I ate. What happened, Jessie? What happened? Nothing. Nothing, Jerry. No. I just came to get the clothes. It might rain. No, not alone. Jerry's here. Hey! Okay. I'll call you later. Weren't you outside the office today... with Jessie? No. Even now you aren't on the terrace, right? I came to get the clothes. It could rain. I'm not an idiot, you p***. I don't get angry often. And Jerry's my brother-in-law. But he shouldn't have said that. I wanted to forgive him... but couldn't. One punch, at least! Anyway, Jessie's the one I love... not Jerry. Shit. Jerry, wait. I'll kill you! Listen to me. Jerry sorry, let's talk first. Jerry... You shouldn't have abused me. We pay rent on time. What are you both doing? Oh my God! Stop, Jerry. Why're you guys fighting? He started it. I don't know why. - Such a kid! - Stop it! Bad words... Okay, Jerry. Sorry, Jerry. Jessie, I'm sorry. I'm leaving. I won't spare you... I'm telling you. The signal was weak. Give me a minute. What's up Jerry? Anything I can do for you? Get into the car. If we beat you up here, you'll lose face. Otherwise there's another option. Lick my shoe, it's branded. Apologize. Then get lost. Not too much to ask? What do you say? Come on, Jerry. Let's save time and whack him. His face calls for action. Hey, hang on! Jerry, I'm sorry about yesterday. I shouldn't have hit you. Didn't you feel bad when I broke your nose? I felt bad too, when you abused me. There's nothing between Jessie and me. And no, no one's calling for action. This isn't an action movie. And neither is it a love story, I think. So I'll head out. I'm batting. You guys enjoy. Jerry... sorry once again, brother. Want to make speeches eh? Where are you off to? What's the rush? Mr. Kulkarni. You come out here please. Please come out. Ask him what he did to my daughter. If my son would've done this to your daughter... would he have let it go? He would've spoken with you. Not called goons. And if at all he'd fight, he'd fight alone. Now he's a trained boxer. What can I say? And you called goons. I should call the police. Ha! Did you hear this? You'll call the police? Yes. Okay. Lodge a complaint. Let's see. Let's see. Your son's a ruffian, not mine. What're you saying? - What do you think? - Tell dad to keep quiet. He's jobless? Yes. He is. He just loafs around all day! Keep quiet. He's an assistant director... with the director of Sholay. He works in cinema? He's an idiot. Tell him to never speak to Jessie again. Go ask your girl why she hangs around here all day! Jessie must have done something. Sachin doesn't come upstairs. She comes here. Your son is an eve teaser. I'll have him arrested. You'll see. Let's see...who is the thug... Stop. Let's go. This is my house. - I'm sorry, Uncle. - And this is my daughter. Ok? Dad, what are you doing? Lets go up. Vacate, right now. We won't. We won't vacate. Go talk to the builder. - Why should I talk to the builder? - Dad, please. - I've paid six months advance rent! - Dad, just forget it! It's not a joke! I have a receipt to prove it! To hell with the receipt! We'll see! I'll go to the consumer court. The idiot! The rubbish he talks. He has to serve a three-month notice first. We won't vacate just like that. Are you in love with Jessie? Yes. Yes. And what about her? She will... I mean, it takes time for such things. You break her brother's nose and she will still love you? But his nose will get better. I hope. I will be a film-maker. Jessie will fall in love with me. Is there any normal hope in your life? Who breaks his girlfriend's brother's nose? You should've told me you love her... I would've controlled my anger. Dad! Now, all the best. What else? Jessie...What? You called me, right? Now you're leaving? I thought it's all over... She said don't think. It 'is' all over! This is how you show your love... by hitting my brother? I love you and you know that... Okay... I'm getting married. End all of this now, Sachin. What...married? Because of all this? They've been thinking for some time now. But now, it's final. I gave us a serious thought as well. That I'll try and convince them. But after all this... it's impossible now. Sachin... next month, the 23rd... is my wedding... at the same church. You tell me, Sachin. What do I do? Go. Go, get married, Jessie. What else? You haven't come here to ask for permission! You're just informing me. Right? So you've told me. Why're you still here? Go! This one or that one? You get in that one. - Get in dear. - Let me call you back. Okay, get in. I saw them leave for Kerala, for Jessie's wedding. Obviously we weren't invited. I shouldn't have hit Jerry. Sheesh! I turned out to be the biggest problem. No. This isn't right. Listen, Sachin... remember the people with the colorful sarongs... There's a bright chance they'll color our faces black and blue. So let's ignore it. Sir. I've got to go. Give me one reason why you want to go, Sachin. Sir, you know the reason. I want to see her one last time. Sir, please. For the sake of your own Jessie. Jessie's wedding. Such a grand ceremony! What am I doing here, sir? Look, let's not stand here. Let's leave, or go inside. You should've thought this through. Sheesh. He's seen us. Sir, Jessie's uncle. Hello. You are Jessie's friends right? Come come. - Come come. - Hello. Why're you outside? No. We were just waiting. All of Jessie's friends are there inside. Come, please come. Everyone is waiting for Jessie. Come sit down, why are you nervous? Also, you must have lunch after the wedding. Food? - Yes thanks. - Okay. Take punches, take kicks, take the slaps, take a beating... we'll take it all! Sir, what're you saying? The truth, buddy. One only speaks the truth in a church. Get down. Oh fish! Jerry, Jessie's brother. Don't look back. I'm behind the camera anyway. You don't look back. Why is all this happening to you, Sachin? I feel so bad. Of all the girls in the world, why did I fall in love with Jessie? Even my great granddad cannot answer that. Jessie's here, sir. Should I talk to Jessie, sir? NO! Not here. Shut up! Tell me when you want to leave, okay? Let's watch till then. Come on, buddy. Let's pray. Get up. Let us all participate in this ceremony with sincerity and devotion. Sir, she seems happy. Let's go. I told you this would be emotionally damaging. Now let's leave after a few minutes, or there'll be physical damage as well. Sir, won't the priest ask if she's willing? Right? He'll ask Jessie first, right? In the movies, they ask the boy first. Sir... Now what Sachin? Sir, after asking them, they'll ask us too, right? Should I object, sir. I've seen that happen in movies. Sir, can I object? Sachin, shut up. Such drama happens only in the courtrooms of Hindi movies. We'll be dead meat, please don't do that. Roy Thomas... by the rules of god, and by the grace of this church... With a free mind, and with complete acceptance... Do you take Jessie to be your wife? I do. Of all the girls in the world, why did I fall in love with Jessie? Jessie, by the rules of god, and by the grace of this church... With a free mind, and with complete acceptance... Do you take Roy Thomas to be your husband? I have got something to say. I'm not interested in this marriage. Jessie, what are you talking about? I don't want this wedding now. No Jessie. Father, I'm sorry. I will talk to her, please. Dear, Jessie, what are you talking? Excuse me... Excuse me... - What happened? - The girl said 'No'. Did you hear that? Jessie said, 'No'. What did you do buddy? She said, 'No'! What? What did she say? Quite some love connection you've got! Roy, I'll take care of it. Dad, I'm sorry. Please. What's happening? I've given it a lot of thought and I don't know what else to do. I'm sorry, I can't go through with this right now. Roy, I'm sorry. I'll talk to her. Jessie! Sir, she has seen us. I know. Dear, dear, what is this? Jessie, dear. If she says even a word to us, we'll be in our graves within five minutes. No problem, sir. But I have a problem. Please... everyone come home and have food. It's a treat from me for passing MCA in first class. My beloved, come to me! There was only one thought in my mind... What a girl! I could give up my life for her. My beloved, come to me! How were we to know that she is going to do this? We are shocked ourselves! Dude, there's quite a ruckus here! What should we do? Let's get away quickly or we'll be killed! Come on. Anyway lunch has been cancelled. Sir, saw what happened! This is why I wanted to come to Kerala. Even God cares about my emotions! Of course. He does. I can't get her out of my mind. Did you see how happy she was, when she saw me? Like she found who she'd been looking for! She's one of a kind, sir! She's one of a kind, sir! Be grateful Jessie didn't speak to us there. Or we'd be beaten so badly we wouldn't recognize each other. Really, she is one of a kind! Sir, what do I do now? Out here, or in life... nothing makes sense anymore. Oh, so my little philosopher is at the emotional crossroads... at such a time some vehicle will come and take you to your destination. Don't you worry! Here it comes already, see. Hop on, buddy. Your life is about to change. This is your ticket to paradise. Ticket... ticket... It's funny how all the churches here look the same. The same... The same... No sir, this is the same church! The very same. What? Where the devil is this bus going! Holy mother of God! Her brother's seen us. We're dead, sir. Come come, Jerry is calling us. Hey stop the bus! Stop! They are chasing us. They wouldn't have seen us. Duck down! Hop on to the bus. Ticket to your destination. You'll have us killed! How was I to know this is your destination? Now they'll assume Jessie and I had planned to elope. They'll go mad with anger. It's a huge mess! And Jessie is clueless. What do we do now? I'm such a well-known cameraman. We'll say we were here to check out a location. Hey stop the bus! Stop! Shashi, what is it? They'll beat us to pulp, sir. Stop the bus! Stop! He stopped the bus! Now nothing can save us from a beating! What the hell are you doing here? Hey, isn't he Jessie's classmate? They had come home a while ago and had lunch with us. What's the problem? He was in the church as well. Classmate? Get off the bus! Get off now! I won't get off. What will you do? What is the issue inside the bus? Out., out...get out. You get off. Get down... We are getting down, just a minute. Nothing inside the bus... Get off now. everyone get out... Come Sachin we will have to talk. Matters will get worse... he's a mad man. What's the matter? Please listen to me. We were here to scout locations. For this new movie, Romance by Chance'. I'm a very big cameraman. Beat him...beat him... Who are they! What's happening there! Of all the girls in the world, why did you fall in love with Jessie? That really is a million dollar question! Sir, I also want the answer to that. Remember all your bravado... 'I'll give up my life for Jessie'... The right time has come. Go ahead, give up your life. Don't worry, sir. We all die someday. Dying for Jessie will be a worthy death, sir. I don't mind. 'I don't mind'! Why should I die, huh? How's it a worthy death for me? It's okay, sir. I'm such a popular cameraman... and look how I've been disgraced. I've seen an original police station for the first time ever! I'm doing Ramesh Sippy's movie. He'll kick me out. What will my family think? What? Sir... What Sir, she called the wedding off! Sachin, you're such a selfish jerk! "Just like yesterday, as you had come into my arms of dreams". Why did you come, Sachin? Did you come to the church for me? I can't face anyone anymore... destroyed my honor! Move aside! What more do you want to say? There is nothing more to say now! So, I am the problem here, huh? I took a decision and that is the problem, right? Okay, I am not doing anything. Okay just cool down. - Sit down. - You all can do whatever you want! I don't care. Look at her. She did the same thing. It is running in the family. Everyone wants to elope and get married? - Dad! He has followed her here too. - Who? Sachin and his friend. What? Yes, Dad. He has come here before... claiming to be her classmate. They had food as well. Yes, Sachin and his friend, a cameraman. They said they were her classmates and we had them over. Did you hear that? What nonsense is this! Dad, they are at the police station now. What police station now? I have booked them for hitting Roy. Looks like they had a plan. Maybe they had a plan to elope. You guys, please step outside.... please, please. Jerry... Jerry, is Sachin at the police station? Jerry, do you even know me? If I wanted to elope, I would've done it a long time ago. Dad, I didn't know that Sachin was there. That's not the reason I called the wedding off. I only saw him at the church when I was walking out. I didn't even know he was there. I promise you dad, believe me. What's Sachin done, Mom? Why have they arrested him? He hasn't done anything wrong. Jessie, I will never allow this. You know, Roy Thomas, he is Vice President. Future Line in San Francisco. And who the hell is he? A film director? Is that even a profession? And what future does he have? And my God Jessie, he's a Hindu. Don't you remember what happened with your sister? I promise you. I won't ever talk to him or see him again. Just bail him out! Jessie! What about the wedding? - What about the wedding? - Look here. Listen to me. You heard her, no? Bail him out. Bring him out and send him away please. Joseph sir has come. I will call later. That's Jessie's dad. Get up! There have been mistakes on both sides. We are about to file the case. No, you don't have to file the case, let them go. - Are you sure sir? - Sure. - Will there be any trouble? - There won't be any trouble, let them go. Why were you staring at him like that? Why do you have so much anger inside you? And stop laughing. Listen... Here's another idiot. Don't mess with us. I'm warning you. No, sir. We won't. I don't know why I even bailed you guys out. You'd have been locked up for two weeks. No, sir. Look, even Jessie will not speak to you, at all. Of course! Get lost from here. Yes, sir. Don't ever let me see you again! No sir. Who are you? Sir, I am a cameraman. As in... You look like a decent guy. Why don't you put some sense in him? I will sir. - Do that! - I will take care... - And get lost! - Sure sir. Come! Come on. Yes, sir. Even if everything works out... how are you going to deal with her father and brother? They don't even speak with you decently. There's family stuff, having dinner together and all, as well. They hate you brother. They hate you. Sir, I don't care even a bit about their hatred. All this can be sorted out in minutes. But Jessie should say yes. I want to meet Jessie, sir. Sachin, are you completely out of your mind? I have some responsibilities in life! Even you are my responsibility! You're not seeing her again! - Sir please. - No! Sir, please. You'll have us killed! Why's the place lit up? Did Jessie agree to the marriage? What? No, sir! Sir, if you're caught, don't mention my name. Wait, that means we could get caught! The plan's cancelled. Don't go. Don't. I want to see you. I want to talk to you, Sachin. Just once. Now. Maybe for the last time. Where are you, Sachin? Sachin... Sachin. You are looking so beautiful today. Even in your wedding saree. You're crazy, mental. I was thinking about you and here you are. In front of me. I've seen you. Now go away. No one else must see you. Go away. Please, come out for a bit. Please. No... Please. Okay, You know what... wait. Okay. Come here. I promised dad that I won't ever see you or speak with you. Promises are meant to be broken, Jessie. And thanks for calling the wedding off. That too in the church. What guts, Jessie! You didn't like that Roy Thomas? I like you. I'm in love with you, Sachin. If you had to figure out in a church, you could've done that in Mumbai. Mumbai has some really good churches. And you even go to church every Sunday. I gave you a lot of trouble, right? I literally chased you. And you fell in love. No, it's not that. I'd fallen in love with you at first sight. At that gate, that instant. Every time I'd see you... Your eyes would entreat me, and I wanted to say so much. And that day when we met on the terrace... I wanted to touch you. When you proposed to me, I got angry... only because I thought you figured everything out. Thank God you followed me to Kerala. To apologize. I liked that. Then you wrote "Friends" in the train. I looked for you everywhere... and the moment I saw you, my heart beat faster than the train. I didn't ever admit to it Sachin, but that was love. And when you kissed me, I couldn't stop you. Happy now? Sachin, go away. I told you things would go wrong. You... You're a good person. You don't deserve all this. I am sorry. This is my fault. All this is because of our love. And you're an even better person than me. Come away with me, let's go now... I'll fix everything. Sit here. Sit. I'd come away with you right now. I really love you. All I want is that everything should work out peacefully. Even you want that, right? I'll convince my dad. I'll come to you, for you, Sachin! You're talking like me now. Strong and romantic. I love you, Sachin. I love you, Jessie. "I shall become like the waves". "That of the river of times". "I had come to the shores just to meet you". "But wherever it is now".

Sachin, why are you just standing? Show, na? Take number please. Sachin! Yes, sir. Good Rahul, very good. A little more energy, okay? It's your first day, right? Yes, sir. - See that A.D. there? - Yes sir. She'll yell a lot, she'll make you run around. And... you'll have to do what she says... Yes, sir. - listen to her... - Yes sir. and learn as well. Yes, sir. - Clap! - Yes sir. Action! Okay, listen. Yes, sir. Over there, near the sea... The actor stands, sad... Just as we read his feelings, the camera charges at him... and then... Rahman sir takes over. "Is love a dream or some sort of passion". "Why does someone fall in love". "In love there is just restlessness". "Then why does the heart feel in peace when it is in love".

Enough is enough, and it is done! "Why does everything seem lovely in love". "Why does the one who tortures You also seem heart-warming". "Even if the one whom You are in love which breaks Your heart". - 37 by 4 take 1. "Still the heart.. - Damn! - Sorry, sorry, sir. ..feels nothing". 37 by 4 take... "May someone please explain to me what love is". "Love... love... love... love". Sachin... Jessie... What happened, Sachin? No calls, no messages. Me? I mean... Jessie, you didn't reply. I thought there was some problem. The shoot went on all day and night. And signal... Sachin... It's a huge mess out here... I want to... I'm coming there. Tell me how to get there from Mangalore. What are you saying, Jessie? What happened? Same old... Roy and all. You'll get irritated with it as well. I want to come for you, Sachin. I told you I would, in Kerala. Jessie...where we are now... you can't come here. You shouldn't come here. You don't want me to come? That's not what I said, Jessie. This place isn't right for you. You'll be uncomfortable. I'll be uncomfortable. Try to understand, please. I'll get back, we'll talk about it. It'll work out. Relax. You don't want to be with me. And you aren't letting me be with you. In Kerala, you wanted me to come away with you right that instant. And now...? You also refused then. Didn't I understand? Please calm down Jessie. I'll come there. I have work here. I've absolutely no time. I'll come there. We'll figure something out. Okay, Jessie? Jessie? Jessie? Jessie, are you there? Jessie, can you hear me? Yeah, Sachin. All right. You come back. We'll talk. I'll wait, okay? Bye! Jess...Jessie... his is the last and final boarding call for passenger Jessie Joseph travelling to Mangalore... you are requested to proceed to gate no 3 immediately. his is the last and final boarding call for passenger Jessie Joseph travelling on... When did you talk to Jessie? The night before last. What's the plan? Sir, I'll leave, and get back in two days. Hmm. Please speak to Ramesh Sir... I'll be back soon... You talk to him. That'll be better. Okay. Go. Sir... I... Deal with the matters of your heart first. Then come back. Work will be even more fun. Go. Turn left from the HDFC bank. What is it now, Sachin? What does this message mean? What do you mean it's over? What do you mean it's over? What do you mean? What? No need to yell. Stop it! Sachin... Listen... Sachin... We need to talk. Here I am, just for you. Instead of being at the shoot, at work. What do you want? Where do you want to go? What's the problem? It's all over, Sachin. Please let me go. It's over. You wrote that in the message already. But why? Why...that's what I want to know. Nothing's so wrong that you're doing this. Everything was fine 20 days go. Things were great. What's the problem now, Jessie? Three days ago you wanted to leave everything... and come to me. And now... It's over! The moment has gone, Sachin. That moment is no more. Because I told you not to come? Don't come now? That's why? Right, Jessie? Because I told you not to come? Or is it your dad... he said something again? I'll talk to him as well! I don't care, Sachin. I don't love you anymore. I don't care anymore. And stop talking such rubbish about my dad. What's happened, Jessie? Where did I go wrong? Jessie... It's not you. It's not my dad. It's not our religions. It's me, Sachin. It's me. I'm not made for you. Why did you love me like crazy... what had I done? I just walked past you, that's all. You kept on chasing me... Why? Jessie. I told you not to. But you didn't listen. And I too fell in love with you. I'm so sorry. And you know what, now it hurts, yes. But I like it. And I hate cinema. I hate your world... The darkness...the crowd... And you want to make films? Yes, Sachin? We were wrong from the start. Completely wrong! But I've never felt better. But we both should feel it right? That isn't happening. And somehow, I can live with you hating me, but not my parents. I've given it a lot of thought, and I'm tired now. This can't be fixed. I must go, Sachin. I can't let you go, Jessie. I'll wait... forever. Don't worry... There are problems but problems can be solved, Jessie. Sachin, let me go please. I can't let you go, Jessie. No way! I don't love you anymore. And it will be easy for you to forget me... it will probably be more difficult for me to fall in love with you again. You don't mean that, Jessie. That was it. Jessie walked out of my life. I stood there for an hour that night. She didn't come back. She should have come but... Please don't hate me. I'm sorry Sachin. "The art that no one has understood yet is love". "Is love a prize or a punishment". "If someone has said this" This is madness! Can't understand anything! "That love is God". It was a one way ticket to heartbreak city. Jessie showed me the middle finger, and walked out of my life. "Explain to me what love is". "May someone please explain to me what love is". "May someone please explain to me what love is". "May someone please explain to me what love is". Was she there? "what love is". She's married. She isn't here now. She is in UK. Sachin, forget her and move on. Sound. - Rolling. - 96 by 2 take 1. - Clap. - Sachin out. Action. Follow him closely. Water should not fall on the camera. I have a degree in being a goon. Don't go on my uniform. Hey, I shall take out your degree, now. Rainig hand? I'll get you inside. You... Because of you, all of us got yelled at yesterday! As if you're the only one who does any work around here. Anyway, I forgive you. You don't need to kneel down. You've assisted sir in the scripting as well, right? Don't jump on a high horse. Sir will cut you to size one of these days. Okay? 41 by 7 take A. Film-making is a creative process. There's a bit of creative tension, and a bit of creative shouting as well. I love you all! Absolutely no problem. I introduced you to Ramesh Sippy. Now you're upset that he's angry. 'He yelled at me'. Which cameraman treats you to sweets like this? After you. It's okay. You go. There's something I have to say. I don't know what's on your mind... or what you feel about me. But I like you. I really like you. It's like... I hated you at first. - What I see in her eyes... - And now I just want to be around you. was in my eyes for Jessie once. Was... I cannot accept. So I felt that I should immortalize this into a story. My story and Jessie's story. Jessie's story and My story. "The rustling inside my heart has started increasing". "I had prayed for this moment". "When the distances are eradicated". "And every bond is broken, this is that moment". "The beauty got decorated, and the sound of music is echoing everywhere". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". "It's an auspicious moment". "It's an auspicious time for meeting". "May the life of my beloved remain blessed". "It's an auspicious moment". "It's an auspicious time for meeting". "May the life of my beloved remain blessed". "May there be peace in every vein". Sir, my film is finalized. What? Really? I personally wanted to give you the advance cheque. So sweet of you! And I specially spoke to the producers about it. Sir...please. Wonderful! Congratulations! And thank you. Good. Thank you, sir. What's the title of your movie? Jessie? Sir, you're a genius. Also I... I just love the way it begins. Why did the circle of love have to stop at Jessie? Brilliant... sir this is the one, I definitely want to do this. Sam. You should play Jessie. What? What are you saying? Why don't you play Jessie's part? Are you mad? Tell me who you want. We'll go look around. We'll find someone. You. "O lovely girl as beautiful as a swan". "Listen to it, my heart is calling out to You". "We will both drown in this". "These waves of love are so deep". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". "It's an auspicious moment". "It's an auspicious time for meeting". "May the life of my beloved remain blessed". "Carry a mild fragrance". "May the talks remain soft-spoken". "May all the relationships remain pleasant". "May all the desires be fulfilled". "May there remain no distances between the hearts". "It's an auspicious moment". "It's an auspicious time for meeting". "May the life of my beloved remain blessed". "It's an auspicious moment". "It's an auspicious time for meeting". "May the life of my beloved remain blessed". "O my beloved". "O my beloved". So you have become a director finally! Hmm. Do you have someone in your life now? There is someone, isn't there, Sachin? I'm sure there must be someone. Someone better than me, less confused. Yes, there is someone. Who is she? I mean, tell me about her. She's beautiful. She loves me a lot. Hmm. One day she told me... that she fell in love with me at first sight. It's been two years now. I was very angry when you left. Nothing was making sense in life. But when I met her, everything became fine again. She's very nice. She's a good girl. Tell me more... She is simple. No make-up. Only a little... when she's out with me. Her hair curls at the bottom, and is straight near the top. She never raises her voice. She's one of those delicate, calm girls. I don't even notice anything else when she's with me. Saree... she looks amazing in a saree. She loves to wear sarees. She's madly in love with me. We ride a lot on my bike. I've kissed her too. We're always in each other's heart's... and in each other's arms. We meet anywhere, at any time. We go almost everywhere together. Only, movies... She doesn't like movies. I don't know why. When she speaks Hindi, there's a slight Malayalam accent. But I like it nevertheless. Her name is... Jessie, Jessie. After you left, she's the one that took care of me. Otherwise I would have been a mess. After you left, Jessie, I had given up on life. You can't ever forget your first love. Getting over you was very difficult, Jessie. It's only because she was in my heart that I'm okay. But I'm not a part of her life either. She's married. She also loves her parents. She can do anything for them. She'd even leave me, her love. Very few girls can sacrifice love for the sake of their parents. I salute her. She is brave. But none of that matters, Jessie. She'll always be in my heart. She herself would not like to leave from my heart. And if at all she does go, she'll tell me before leaving. Not like you... who left without informing. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I'm still not married, Sachin. I left you, but I couldn't forget you. I am not married, Sachin. My dad didn't like you, and I didn't like his choice. I've been in Delhi for the past six months. Dad's still trying to convince me. He was here, he left last week. He wants me to get married. I refused. He left in a huff. I have not been able to forget you. I will never be able to either, Sachin. You were my first love too, Sachin. It's not been easy for me either. I'm sorry I couldn't see you before I left. I thought you'd get over me with time. But I was wrong. I thought you'll move on. I was so wrong. I'm so sorry. But why is all this happening again? Of all the days I choose to come to see the Taj, you're here! Did you have to come here today, Sachin? I don't want all this again. In fact, I'm leaving. Jessie... Jessie... Let's get married, Jessie! Please, right now. Right this instant. If we let this moment pass... Ten years later when we meet, you will ask me why we let this moment go. Jessie, nothing will change. Ten years, twenty years... all through life. Nothing will change between us. We didn't meet today by chance. It wasn't just by chance even then. What we felt in that moment that our eyes met... that was love. There is something here, something that's just ours. Let's get married. Today. Right now. Holy mother of God. It'll be a new life, a new start. Come on, Jessie. Please. Say yes, say yes, Jessie. Please, say yes. Jessie, please. Jessie. Yes. Yes. There's a board here. It says that indecent behavior in the park is a punishable offence. But I don't care even if I'm arrested. I want to kiss you, Jessie. Please let me kiss you. Yes, please kiss me. "Listen what my heart is saying in the form of heartbeats".

I'm in the bathroom. Yes, coming! Jessie... Dad... They didn't show her father's reaction. That's not important. Good thing is, the couple got together at last. So, how did you like the movie? Very much. No doubt. It's a hit. How did you like the film? I really liked it. I could see myself, I mean both of us... our life. Same house, Sachin? The house had to be the same. But I wasn't that nice to you. Yeah, agreed. But I thought I'd make you look good in the movie at least. Yeah, Nikhil! What are you saying? Seriously? - Hasn't Anay sir done a superb job? - Yeah seriously. Holy mother of God... It's a super hit! You hit the jackpot at first try. What a great movie, buddy! Even I've done a damn good job. The movie's looking great. Nikhil had just called. Did you like it? I liked it a lot. - It's about your life anyway eh? - Yeah. - Had a good time? - Very good. Good, good. Okay, now let's head to PVR Juhu. Let's watch it with the audience there. Jessie, come along. You both come together. It'll be great. Ramesh Sippy Sir's there already. Vijay, Aalif, everyone's coming... Congratulations! Anay sir gets a little too excited. We'll get to know on Monday. Everyone's praising you. Everyone other than me seems to know how talented you are. Sachin, you should've married someone who's watched at least 25 movies. Why me? Because I need you to make good movies. I almost cried during the Taj scene. I know. How? While you were watching the movie, I was watching you. You're my real audience, Jessie. And hello, when did we ever kiss in the park? Don't laugh! Sachin, I clearly remember you hugged me... then looked at me... and hugged me again. When did you kiss? Jessie, you've forgotten, dear? That's the kiss that gave my life back to me. No chance! Idea! Let's get dad to watch the movie. Maybe he'll understand you better then. What say? Now it's just a stray - hello'. Maybe he'll start talking to you. Yes, Sachin. You get him! I'm not so sure such a miracle can happen. Jessie, I'll just do the rounds of a few theatres. I'll drop you home first, come. I'll come with you. But you don't like the crowd, the darkness, the noise... Sachin, just take me along, will you? Okay. Come on. You and your dad...! - Papa... daddy... father. - Okay. Shall we, Sachin? No, really. I'm serious. I can't figure you guys out. You're bizarre folk. Bizarre? What is that?! Now that you've become a writer and director, don't use such words.
