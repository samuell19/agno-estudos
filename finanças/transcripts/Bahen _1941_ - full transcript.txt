Continue doing good for all You are a tourist. This world is a tourist resort There's a lot of movement here day and night One came and settled here while the other departed Continue doing good for all This life will dawn in a split second Daylight claims it will be dark soon Look, the sun has set someplace Continue doing good for all Gentleman... l've been serving this assembly for fifteen years now. Every month l make efforts to improve your lives. But it is regrettable that years of hard work and lectures.... have born no results. The Ramayan, Mahabharat, Geeta, and the Vedas... l completed them all, l told you stories of great men and saints... but all those lectures proved to be futile. l can see today sins are increasing day by day... at the speed of a swelling river during the rains. Charity has completely ceased. The lord of wealth is reigning everywhere. There's nobody to listen to the hungry, poor and despondent. Believe me, this earth and sky cannot endure... any more transgression. Crimes against young girls and widows will have an effect. Have some shame, friends. Go drown yourselves. You call the earth your mother... yet you sit in the mother's lap and commit such heinous sins. Watch out, reform yourselves, worldly men. The mother is going to be mortified. And the time is near when she will engulf her shameless sons. Be careful, be careful. Perhaps some time still remains. Child, did you go listen to the scholar's discourse today? Yes, Baba, l did. The scholar seems to be very wise. Child, the life of a city is no place for the sage. - Baba? -That's right, child. This township isn't worthy of living in any longer. Let's go make a home elsewhere. Baba? That's right, child. God made the idiot to speak the truth today. Mother is going to engulf her sons tonight. Let's go. Blessed are you, god! Why do you have expectations, stupid man? Your desires are shattered Why do you have expectations, stupid man? The garden which was once verdant is a wreck today The gardener is crying This is the inanity of the world Why do you have expectations, stupid man? Your desires are shattered Why do you have expectations, stupid man? My sister. Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush. Hush. - Show me your ticket. - Hush, hush, hush! Show me your ticket! Check their tickets first. l'll show it to you in a minute. - Show me your ticket. - Hush, hush! - Show me your ticket. - You seem to be in a hurry. Hold her. Hold her and l'll show it to you. Where has the ticket gone? Give my sister to me! Give my sister to me! lnsane. Send everyone to the asylum, but my sister will stay with me! Look, look, you people can't care for my sister! She'll die without me. Give my sister to me! Give my sister to me! God, who in this world hasn't committed a crime? Who hasn't and who won't? But you are merciful, god. Why do you reflect on our sins? Reflect on your mercy. lf man commits a crime, your duty is not to punish him. You should express the truth to him... so he is shamed into giving up crime. God... Captain, can you tell me how my sister is and where she is? She must be crying. Who bathes her? Does she get enough milk? Tell me, captain. You are such a giant and you're crying for a tiny sister? - l was apologizing to god. -Why? l had inappropriate thoughts for god the day of the quake. That's why he was upset with me. Perhaps that's why he took my sister away from me. You fool, she's in the ashram over here. She's doing well. - How do they feed her? - Three times a day. Captain! Captain! Captain, how's my sister doing? She gets her feed on time, doesn't she? You ask me this five hundred times every day. How's my sister? How's my sister? What's wrong with your sister? She's just fine. Go do your work. How's my sister, captain? Your sister died! My sister died? My sister died? Why did you come here? Why are you beating me, mother? This is my sister. l'm not here to steal. This is my sister. l came to see her. Speak! - Why are you beating me? - Tell why? But sir, why did he tell me my sister died? Do you know breaking out of prison is a crime? You're being ridiculous, sir. lf someone came and told you your sister died... wouldn't you do the same? Okay, okay. Come with us. The babies are disturbed. Let's go. l came to see my sister. By god's grace the captain was wrong. And l was going to return. You didn't need to come after me. l am not a thief or a criminal who would break out. Give the child to me. But sir, tell them my sister must be fed three times a day. Yes, yes, she will. And mother, all these women here are untrustworthy. They're no good. They sleep all day long. Mother, they sleep all the time. l'm telling you. l'm telling you they go to sleep. lf a thief came instead of me... lf a thief had come instead of me, he'd take off with the child. Amar is released from jail... and after looking about here and there... we see him working in an iron foundry. Apply kohl for you, my princess Your eyes are like roses, my princess Apply kohl on you, my princess l am cherished by my brother My dear sister is sweet l embrace you Your eyes are like roses, my princess Apply kohl on you, my princess People are coming to see me Because l'm looking so nice l'll dress you like a bride l'll dress you like a bride, my princess Your eyes are like roses, my princess Apply kohl on you, my princess My Bina will get an education, grow up. Then we'll have a grand wedding for her. No, l will get you married. - Really? And to whom will l get married? - To me. No way! l won't marry you. You are a very bad girl. l shall marry the best. Tell me Bina, who is the best? - Shall l tell you? Shall l tell you? - Yes. - My brother. - You naughty girl! - Champa! - Brother! Yes, Bina. Bina, Bina, Bina, Bina. Bina, Bina, Bina, Bina. Champa, l've told you many times not to do this daily. l would like to clean her up myself. But you come home weary. What do you mean l come home weary? l can manage everything on my own. Brother, bring me some sweet dumplings. l'll bring you sweet dumplings. l'll bring my girl toys as well. l'll bring her anything she asks for. Brother, Champa says you, brother, are the best. Now you sit here and study for a bit. l'll fetch your book for you. No brother, l'm feeling sleepy. How could you be sleepy? l took you all this time... and brought you so many things. Now study for a little while. My Bina studies more than the rest. My Bina is such a good girl, she recites her lessons daily. Very good, my dear. My Bina is not a bad girl. She does very good work. She works more than all... and then she studies. Tell me what you learned yesterday. What did you learn yesterday? Good girl. - ls Bina asleep? - lt's 10:00 PM but you aren't asleep yet. l'm waiting up for father. He's gone to aunt's house. - Then he must be on the way. - l heard you don't like my cooking. - Who says so? - And l heard you're annoyed with me. - Why would l be annoyed with you? - l help clean Bina. - You said so yourself. - Yes, l'll start taking her with me. What'll she do there? l leave her here at your insistence... but you've taught her many bad things. - l? - Yes, you. Get up, get up. Get up. Let me sleep. Go on, get up! You go to bed as well. But tell me what l've done. Tell you what you've done? You told her l'm the best. Why did you say it? How do you know l'm the best? And what makes you think l'm the best? You're getting annoyed with me again. Look Champa, for the past few days l've noticed... you stare at me. l don't like all that. What's the reason? Who says l'm such a good man? Talk. Talk. Why are you silent now? - Please forgive me. - Forgive you. Forgive you. Forgive you. First you offend someone... and then ask for forgiveness. What nonsense! You're right. There's no reason to cry. And what right do you have to cry? l'm the best? You love me? Answer me. What sort of a game is this? What am l to understand from your crying? Maybe you're unhappy. That's why you're crying. Possibly you're bothered because of your poverty. lt might not be love for me that bothers you. lf you love me, then just admit you love me. Talk! Won't you answer me? Talk! Okay. Touch my hand. lf you touch it, l'll know you love me. And if you don't touch it, l'll know you're crazy... and that's why you cry. Go! Go away! Go away! Go away! - Who were you telling off, brother? - Nobody. Nobody. - Tell me. - Juju came just now. He told me to leave Bina and go with him. l told him off. l'm frightened, brother! - No, no, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Juju won't come now. Go to sleep now. Rest. Rest. You're a good girl. - No, brother... - Juju will never return. Juju won't come here again, l'll play a tune. l'll put you to sleep. He'll never come. Love can only be paid back with love. Who deserves it more than Bina? You raised her. She has nobody but you in this world. Bina's life might be affected if you fall in love with Champa. You expect her to forget it. ls that possible? But how do l suppress this sudden storm in my heart. How do l end it? You can put an end to this storm. Leave this city right away. So Champa and you might never see each other. lf you don't forget Champa then you must forget Bina. - Silence! - Brother! Brother! Brother! Bina! Bina! - Brother! Brother! What are you doing? - We're leaving. - Where to? - Elsewhere. - Will Champa go with us? - No, no! Champa won't go with us. - When will we return? - Never. Who will dress me if Champa won't be there? l will. l'll dress you myself. l'll dress you myself. Sit on my shoulder. Brother, l'd like to see the owner. - Why? - l have business with him. What business? l've come because l have business. - Why else would l come? - Go. But l would like to see the manager of this company. So, who's that? But a lady is seated there. She's the manager and owner of this company. - Brother. - Yes. She looks just like Champa. Be quiet. Don't say that. You want me to be beaten? - Who is it? - l don't know. He wishes to see you. Send him in. She will see you. Greetings. Say hello. - What do you want? - l've come to see you. And who is this child? My sister. You don't appear to be from Mumbai. That's correct. l'm from Munger. The place of the earthquake? Yes, there was an earthquake. Our house collapsed. Both my parents were lost in it. l went far and wide looking for them but they weren't found. - But why are you worried? You have your brother. - Yes. - Brother, she talks just like Champa. - Be quiet. Pardon me. l've wasted your precious time. l'm bothering you simply because l read an ad... in the newspaper about your firm. l felt l should give it a try. l hoped you might consider me. Yes. The position is still vacant. But may l ask what your qualifications are? My qualification. l failed the eleventh grade. - Failed the eleventh grade? - Yes, yes. - What is it? - Ma'am, these are job applications. The post is taken. Why didn't you tell me before the post had been filled? You wasted both your time and mine. Excuse me. You have filled the post. - Meaning, meaning, meaning, you are employing me? - Yes. Junior! Junior! l'm an employee! How do l thank you? Where are you going? - l'm going inside. - There's nobody inside. Do you know l'm an employee? - Ma'am, this is no way to... - Come in. What did you wish to ask? l wish to ask you where my seat is and my job description. You said you'd tell me today. Starting today, you're my private secretary... and that's your desk. You mean l must sit here? ln this room? That's right. Why? Any problem? Oh no. No problem. - And where will l sit? - You? l'll show you your place, too. Come. Brother, please bring me sweets worth two paisa. And who will man the post here? - Run and get it while l stay here. - That's not possible. Look brother, if you don't bring it... l'll tell your boss you don't do any work. You only sit here smoking all day long. You know she's a good friend of mine, don't you? Oh no, junior. Don't be upset. l'll bring it right away. Brother, bring the red and green ones. My heart chirps lt chirps. lt chirps. My heart chirps Youth is carefree lt does as it pleases. Youth is carefree When the weather is pleasant... my heart chirps - Tell me, did you like it? - Yes. But it sounds like you've learned it recently. Come here, Bina. l wish to tell you something. Yes, ma'am. Ask your brother if his heart is empty or filled. Brother, she asked... Yes, yes, yes. Tell her, brother's heart is totally deserted. lt's in ruins. lt has moss growing on the doors and walls. - Brother says... - Okay, tell him, if that's true... why doesn't he find someone to fill it? The ruins will turn into an immaculate place. Go. Brother, she says why don't you fill it? Then the immaculate place will turn into ruins. - Huh? - No, no. lt'll turn into an immaculate place. Okay, okay. Tell her, brother is afraid of an immaculate place... and he loves the ruins. Go. Brother says... Okay. Tell him, sensible people don't say such things. lf the heart remains vacant a little longer... it will be occupied by witches and bad spirits. - Brother, she says... - Okay, okay. Listen. Go. Brother says a witch has occupied his heart for a long time. Really? Didn't you ask him what the witch's name is? Ask. What is the witch's name, brother? - Bina. - Bina. Mr. Amar, do you know how far we are from the city? What kind of question is that? We're in the car, so how would l know? l could have told you if we were walking. Haven't you been in a car before? Yes, l've been in a taxi a few times. But this is a taxi as well. lf that's the case, please tell me the fare in advance... lest there be a dispute later. Why did you stop the car? To tell you the fare. Mr. Amar, l would like you to permit me... to win you, with your blessings. Well, this isn't a bad deal, but, it is strange ma'am... travelling fifty to sixty miles from Mumbai... has brought about such a change in you. - l pray the car stalls. - lt did stall finally. Are you implying l deliberately stalled it? You think l don't understand? How could you possibly stall such a huge car? lt's not a human being. My darling is naive. He doesn't comprehend love My darling plays with my younger sister-in-law... while the mood goes to waste My beloved, he doesn't comprehend love My darling is naive. He doesn't comprehend love l spread the blanket on a high scaffold My darling went to sleep l sat there alone. l felt offended He doesn't comprehend love My darling is naive. He doesn't comprehend love Greetings, brother. Greetings, sir. Greetings. Please sit. l learned your car broke down. Yes, it seems so. But tell me, can we find a place to spend the night? Oh no, finding a place to stay is difficult. As you can see, there's only one room. l see. Then we can sleep out here. Yes, that's possible. You won't have any problem, nor l. And food can be arranged. Will you have cannabis? Oh no. No cannabis. No cannabis. What is your caste? l? l'm a Brahmin but l don't know about her. You mean you got married without knowing her caste? We aren't married. l keep proposing but he refuses. Oh lord! You proposed marriage yourself? What choice did l have? l tried hinting... but he wouldn't understand. Finally l blurted it out. - Have you studied English? - Yes. Well, then, that's okay. God! What a moonlight! l wish l could come here every day... and the car runs out of gas every time. Right, Amar? That's your wish. But you must bring another companion. Why do you detest me so? Detest? How could l detest you? You're my boss and l your employee. But l don't want you to remain my employee. That can be remedied easily. Fire me. Why won't you understand what l'm trying to say? l understand everything. lt's late. Go to sleep. Or if you wish l could go to Mumbai... and send both, the driver and gas by the first train. Just the gas would do. l see. Give me. Give me. Give my coat to me. She's going to irritate me all night long. Bina's temperature went up last night, sir. lt was very high. Temperature? Why didn't you summon the doctor? Ass! l go out one day and he aggravates my daughter. Brother. - Brother. - Bina. Bina. Hello. Hello. This is Amar. Dr. Joshi, please come quick. Bina is ill. Please be quick. - Doctor? - The child has caught cold. That's why she's running a fever. Send the servant over and l'll give him the medicine. - There's no reason to panic, is there? - No, not at all. - Bye. - Bye. Narayan, why are you nodding off over here? Go to bed. Go on, go to bed. Bina. Bina, open your eyes. Look, Narayan is heating milk to bring to you. My Bina will drink her milk. Bina is a very good girl. Open your eyes, Bina. Please have your tea, sir. You've been awake all night. You get some rest while l sit next to her. Hello. Hello. Oh! lt's you. l cannot come. - Bina's had a fever since yesterday. - That's no reason to panic. Children keep getting ill. Look, attending the party this evening is imperative. No, l can't come. Bina. Bina. Open your eyes. Get up. Drink your milk. Narayan has brought hot milk for you. The doctor said Bina will get better when she drinks hot milk. My Bina will drink hot milk. - Hello! - You mean you won't go to the party this evening? - l told you Bina is very ill. - You must go. ls that an order? How can you expect me to leave her? l gave my word. Hello? Hello? What are you doing over and over again? You hang up before our conversation is finished. l'm free from this transgression. Goodbye Narayan. l am leaving. Hello. There's no Amar over here. l don't know any Amar. Only Mr. Narayan is here. Hang up! Shut up! And once more his great love for Bina... drives Amar away from his life of ease and luxury... and after five years of hardship and struggle we find him. Sir, this man is very hardworking. Sir, this man does his job very well. Sir, this man works day and night. Sir, this man is a scoundrel. He doesn't do any work. l'd fire him at the end of this month if you gave the word. Sure, but the man appears very well-built. The basis of his anger is something else, sir. - lf you don't mind l'd like to tell you. -Yes. Sir, our homes are in the same vicinity. My Shera barks at him when he passes my house. He's angry with me for that. Lies! Complete lies! His Shera is my Chameli's offspring, sir. No way would he bark at me. You're lying. He didn't bark at him earlier, sir. He barks at him ever since he sold Chameli. Do you see how rude he is, sir? He doesn't greet you properly? Don't you see the boss is standing here? So what should l do? Did he hire me to work or to salute him? You're back to your work? Can't you at least bow to the boss? Mr. Rajender, l'd like you to settle this matter today. Did you hire me here to work or to salute you? You need not ask. l've employed you to work. Lend me your ears, sir. Please don't compare me with your other employees. lf you bother me one bit hereafter then... What will you do? Hang me? Murder me? l'll skin you and stuff you with sawdust, get it? Do you see that, sir? The new generation. This man hadn't eaten for three days. He came to me looking for a job. l felt sorry for him and employed him and today... And why don't you also tell him... you took his ancestral silver ring he was left with as a bribe. Not true, sir, it was brass. - ls your name Amar? - Yes. l'd like to know if man can survive three days without food. Mr. Rajender, l can't speak for others... but many times l've starved three days at a time and survived. And you never tried to beg? No. Coincidentally l didn't get a job... but l couldn't bring myself to beg. You seem to be a respectable man. That's right. As long as l had good luck and had money... l was respectable. Ever since l became poor... and troubles besieged me, l'm a disgrace. How's that? Mr. Rajender, apparently you don't know the laws of society. Mr. Amar, give me your address. - Brother. - Would you like some betel leaf? Does Mr. Amar live here? Mr. Amar... Do you know his address? - You know, the tall strong man who works at the factory. -Yes, yes. Look, the address is written here. Number 45. - Forty-five. Forty-five. - l get that, sir. - You have business with him? - Yes, business. l don't know. l'm new here. l came here only yesterday. l see. Where does Amar live? The tall man. - This way. - ln this lane? - Yes. - Okay. Does Mr. Amar live here? You want to know about brother? l see. So Mr. Amar is your brother? Would you tell him Mr. Rajender wishes to see him? Lies. My brother has no friend by the name of Rajender. Excuse me. What's it to you? Just tell him. - l won't do that. - lf you don't tell him, l'll call out to him. - Call. - Mr. Amar! Mr. Amar! Mr. Amar! - Call him again. - You'll make a noise again. Certainly. Tell me what business you have first. l have very important business, but l can only tell him. l won't call brother unless you tell me. But you wouldn't understand. Why wouldn't l understand? Am l a child? - l'll be fifteen this year. - You are an obstinate girl. l am writing a book about all people around the world... with diverse customs, the condition of their lives... their happiness, and their problems. So tell me, what's going on with your trial? lt's god's grace. The hearing is the day after tomorrow, brother. God willing, l'll win. Yes, you have a strong case. And even more importantly... my lawyer is very good. Where you going, brother? Come have a betel leaf. - Uncle? When did you return from your village? - Today. - Are your kids well? - Yes, god is merciful. And my youngest son Shankar misses you very much. Yes, he must be grown now. Brother. Brother. Something strange has happened. - A strange man? - Yes. He's wearing a suit. He asked about you. l told him no Amar lives here. Then he questioned your sister. l signalled her not to tell. l hope she understood. What's the harm even if she tells? lt could be harmful. He looks like a secret police to me. He carried a small book, too. - So why didn't you punch him? -What are you saying, brother? l'm a thief. How can l assault him? To hell with him! l'll deal with him right away. Are you going to write so many details in that book? - Yes. - Will you also write about... the potato peels l tossed at you? Yes, l'll write that as well. Will you call your brother now? The fact is, my brother hasn't returned from work, mister. He hasn't returned from work? But he left the factory at 4:00 PM today. Factory? What factory? l guess you're mistaken. My brother Amar is a school teacher. You must be looking for another Mr. Amar. - Schoolteacher? - Yes, yes. Give me a description of my brother Amar. Your brother is fair skinned, burly and very tall. That's untrue. My brother isn't like that. He isn't. My brother is dark skinned, thin and as short as me. - Oh, what a blunder! - Yes, sir. - You speak English? - Yes, sir. - Then why didn't you tell me before? - No sir. Mr. Rajender? - Mr. Amar, is this your house? - Yes. Come in, come in. Mr. Amar, before l say anything else... - l have to complain. - Complain? Tell me. - Call your sister. - Apparently my sister was up to mischief. Junior! Bina! Come here. Why don't you come here? Come here. Come, come. Mr. Amar, you won't believe this. Your sister told at least 150 lies in thirty minutes. That's why she's hiding her face. You hear that? Mr. Rajender says you lied to him. Come. Come here. Look. Come, come. Come. Closer. Closer. Closer. - Did you lie? - Yes, brother. Why? Brother, he was enquiring about you. l thought, if l tell him brother isn't at home... he might say he'd wait inside. And when you'd come home... you'd ask me why l let a stranger into the home. Then again if l told him you didn't live here and he left... and he turned out to be your friend... who has some business with you... then you'd get upset l didn't invite him in. l thought about that and kept him busy. So you could get here and speak to him personally. l just said whatever l could think of during this time. Do you hear that, Mr. Rajender? l hope you have no grievance now. No sir, not at all. l didn't know your sister was so intelligent. Very good! Bina, this is my boss, Mr. Rajender. l work at his factory. Say hello. Go on. Say hello. Come on, say hello. Brother, so he made a mistake. Had he told me this earlier... l would you have invited him to sit and offered him tea. Very good! Okay, take this and put it away. Take care you don't cut your finger. Mr. Rajender, my sister is all l have left to keep me going in life. You've heard all the details... and you can imagine the troubles l went through... to raise her. She was so little when l left the house. Mr. Amar, frankly speaking your character is worthy of writing in a book. Actually that's the reason l came. l'm writing a book. l'd like some help from you. What are you saying? Book and laborer are like chalk and cheese. Anyway, that shouldn't bother you. That's my concern. Just come to my house with me... so l may speak with you undisturbed. Look, l am in no condition to visit a bigwig's home... but l guess l'll accompany you since you asked. Brother, please come back soon. - Why? Are you afraid? - No, l'm not afraid. But l get very hungry. And l don't eat without brother. That means you love your brother very much? That's right. And brother loves me, too. Liar! l don't love you. You don't? Okay. Then l'll do the dishes today... and my face and hands will get dirty. And l won't eat either. - Then who will get a beating? - And who will cry? Me or you. You wouldn't understand. l slapped her once over some mischief. She seemed to take it in her stride... but l continued to cry for two hours. She only moped. Mr. Amar, it's normal for siblings to love each other... but your case is praiseworthy. That's nothing, sir. Come with me. Look at this, Mr. Rajender. All this is memorabilia from Bina's childhood. No matter the hardships l face... all these items are always with me. For example... this knife. She persisted until l got it for her. One day, she was sharpening a pencil when she cut half her finger. For three months it was bandaged. And... Look at this. This shoe. You might wonder where the other shoe is. lt's like this. She got blisters on her feet with that shoe. She got angry, got rid of it and limped around on one shoe. Bina! Bina! Where did the pacifier disappear? That's with me, brother. Why? Why remove it from here? Brother, l tried it to see how it tastes. ldiot. Put it back. She's a weirdo, sir. l used to bring such pacifiers... and within an hour or two she would chew them up. Here. Have some. - Brothers! l've been robbed! - What happened? - Yes, yes! - Silence please. First ask him how much he lost. You want to know how much? - You would hurt if you lost that much. - Tell us. Listen. 5975 was the number on the five rupee note. The five rupee note was real and a fake two rupee note. And... fifty paise. Oh Ram! Thank god! Thank god! Thank god! Thank god! Thank god! What's the matter, brother? What happened? What can l tell you, my girl? Just thank god! Thank god! Take this. Look at it. Tell me, how can one trust anybody in this world? There's no more faith in this world, my dear. What happened, brother? l worked through the month. Toiled day and night... and when l demanded money, he made excuses. When he finally gave it to me, he gave a fake two rupee note. Now tell me, to whom do l complain? Ram! Ram! Ram! Thank you, god! That's no reason to worry, brother. Neither will the boss be able to build castles for two rupees... nor will we become rich. As long as you are fit and healthy... god will give us thousands of rupees. God is my sole support. He sends it to me somehow. And from places where there's no hope at all. None at all. Yes, brother. Only god knows his ways. Thank you, god! Thank you! Mr. Amar, l have no leisure pursuits. By god's grace l have everything. All l want is to write a book that will make a name for me. l pray it happens. Yes, l'm doing my best. lf only you would help me, too. Please excuse me. This isn't my cup of tea. You don't get it, Mr. Amar. l want you to come stay here for a few days... so l might study your life. Mr. Rajender, l can't do that. But you won't have any problems. Look, Mr. Amar, this drawing room, that bedroom... and this good quality furniture, all for your convenience. Mr. Rajender, are you trying to entice a child with toys? You should know some time back l, too, had a house like this. lt was furnished. l willingly left it to my servant Narayan. Have you ever considered the fact... if you evaluate this furniture justly... roughly 100 people could be provided food and shelter. People who have no place to live or food to eat. Mr. Amar, quite frankly, this has never occurred to me before now. That means you've been living life with your eyes shut. - Who's it for? - The master's guest. So a new creature is here today? Back. Back. Take it away! - Rajen! - Yes, father. - l tell you, you've lost your mind. - Excuse me, father. Didn't you find a saint today? You brought yet another man. ls this house a sanctuary or a hotel? l've told you so many times... if you want to open a sanctuary... why not do it at the factory? Why do you ruin the furniture in the house! Father, you interfere without understanding a thing. You don't know. My book can't be completed without their help. So who asked you to write a book? You harp about the book all day long. The father never wrote a letter and the son is writing a book! ldiot! Mr. Amar, please don't be offended by father. He just rambles on. Quite possibly, Mr. Rajender. Some people pass out after consuming alcohol... while others are comatose under the influence of money. Pardon me but you're one of them. l'll take your leave now. As you wish. l can't force you. But promise me something. Our friendship won't be affected in any way. Look, there's a great disparity between you and me. Nonetheless, l shall do my best. Well, goodbye. Do you have to play the drum even if there's no audience? You're hurting my ears for no reason whatsoever. That's all well and good, brother... but l composed a beautiful song just now. Shut up! A tone deaf person can't compose a song. No brother, you must listen to it or l'll get upset. Okay. Sing. Let's hear it. Sing. But brother, don't laugh or make me laugh. Okay, l won't. Sing. Brother doesn't eat with me How is he to feed himself or feed another? There are no groceries in the house Brother doesn't eat with me He won't let me eat and doesn't eat himself He acts high and mighty He thinks Bina is still naive His ears are red with anger Brother doesn't eat with me What do you think, brother? - How much is this? - A quarter. - This? - One rupee. - This? - A quarter. - This? - Thirty-five paisa. - This. - Fifty paisa. - This? - Seventy-five Paisa. - This? - One rupee. - This? - A quarter. And what if l don't have a quarter? - Then don't buy it. - Listen. Can't we make a deal? Look, my brother gives me two paisa every day. So take the two paisa and give me the item. Then you take two paisa tomorrow, the day after, and so on. And this way your money will be paid off. Oh no, no need for that. You take what you want. Don't worry about the money. No, mister. l can't take it. - Why? - Brother will get annoyed. l know how scared you are of your brother. - Tell me what you want. - Mister... don't talk to me that way. - Why not? - You aren't my brother. - Okay, tell me what you want. - l want nothing. You won't take it? l'll complain to your brother. - Don't hold me responsible then. - l'm not afraid of that. But l'll take it if you do as l say. - What's that? - l'll take these things now. You pay him. But l'll owe you the money. Either l'll ask brother to give it to you... or l'll pay back two paisa a day. Okay, tell me what you want. This, this, this, this, this. Please pack all these items, brother. Okay, sir. Now calculate the money. How much did you pay him? Why are you concerned about the money? Consider these a gift from me. Why would l do that? Why would l accept gifts from you? But strangers can come close this way. But how's that possible? You are rich and we are poor. How can we come close? - Who told you that? - Brother said so. Bina, why don't you suggest to your brother... to come stay with me for a few days? And you come and stay there as well. What do you have in your house? Do you have very nice stuff? l have lots of stuff. A big house, many servants... and good quality furniture. What furniture? You mean tables, chairs and beds? Yes. And l have two or three cars as well. Really? lf l stay at your house, will you take me for a drive every day? Never mind taking you for a drive, l'll give you the car. You'll give me a car? For sure? - For sure. You rich men tell lies. - Who told you that? - Brother says so. - From where did all this stuff come? - l bought it. And who paid for it? Mr. Rajender showed up. He paid for it. Damn Rajender! Why did you ask him for money? l didn't ask him. The vendor was there. l was asking him the prices. He came along and bought this stuff against my will. l told him l don't want it but he wouldn't relent. So l told him l'd tell brother to pay him. Why did you go out of the house at all? You want to paint your face with red make up, too? l'll slap your face until it becomes red. lnsolent girl! You want to wear make up? Throw everything out! This too! During the ancient ages a man lived in a big city. He used to work in a factory. He had a kid sister who was very nice. She never got up to mischief. Her brother reprimanded her daily for no good reason. And... And... And... And... What's written here, brother? - Brother, you aren't annoyed with me now, are you? - No. Then will you bring me something? - What? - Rouge make up. My girl! Oh! You're so late, brother. When will l cook and when will you eat? My girl, we eat food every day... but one doesn't find god every day. God? What are you saying, brother? l mean it. Oh no. Not yet. Close your eyes first. - Close your eyes. -Oh no, brother. Show me first. Never mind. Okay. l'll close my eyes. - God. - God. Every day you complained that god's throne was vacant. lt won't remain vacant any longer, will it? That's right, brother. See how nice it looks. Brother, how much did the alter cost you? How much? Are you crazy? You can't buy god. He goes to the home of the person on whom he shows mercy. All that is very well, brother, but how did you get it? Did you ask someone for it? You could say that. lt was in a place where nobody offered flowers or water. l thought it best l take it with me. l didn't really take it. Nobody can take god against his wish. That's true, brother. That's true. lt's true, but why don't you sing a bajan for god. You provoke me every day. Of course. Why not? l chant your name every day My dearest Shyam l chant your name every day l wander around as a nun and lose my way Roaming the streets looking for you Where are you my Lord Krishna My dearest Shyam l chant your name every day Hail the revered one who plays the flute Hail, hail, hail, Queen Radha My greetings to you My dearest Shyam l chant your name every day - Hello. - Brother isn't at home. Goodbye. So what if brother isn't home? You're at home. l'm upset with you. Upset with me? Why? Of course. The other day l told you not to buy me things... but you wouldn't listen. Finally brother got annoyed with me and threw out everything. l don't know how l'll repay you. l don't care about that. You have to repay me. You won't get one paisa, mister. - Why should l pay when l don't have the articles? - Well done! - You don't make good deals. - That's right. Very good. - Hey, l drank from that glass. - So what? Now your mouth is dirty. - Why's that? - You drank the same water l did. And l lie a lot. Undoubtedly you lie a lot. You just said brother threw everything away. But these bangles are still... That's not it, mister. l had hidden these. You shouldn't have done that. When brother threw away all the other stuff... - lt occurred to me to toss them away but... - But? l didn't. - What will you do with them? - Nothing. l'll keep them. Really? Then why don't you give me two bangles. l'll keep them with me. What for? l will give them to my wife when l get married. Here. But give them to her on my behalf. Let me help you. - l pray your wife is a fatso. - Why? So these bangles don't fit her. - l pray she's exactly like you. - Speak to brother. Bina? - Bina? - Please leave quickly, mister. Okay. Bina, l am leaving. Look, l've brought you some vermilion. Please take it. - l won't. - Why not? lf you like, you can pay me two paisa. Please return in a couple of days, mister. Kusum, you worship god so much. - Do you ever pray for anything? - Yes, l do. - What? - Don't ask me that. Why are you being coy with me? Tell me, tell me. Every day l pray to god... that a poor husband would be acceptable... but not a gambler or alcoholic. You silly! Your wishes are lacking. What if he's a good man and he isn't a gambler or alcoholic... but he's a toothless old grouch who smokes all day long? Oh no. God won't commit this injustice. Whether he does or does not, you must begin praying today. Pray your husband is only three or four years older than you... well educated, not very hostile... even if he's rich and has a car... but someone who's good natured. One who loves me... and surprises me with nice saris and jewelry. Say these things. l didn't have all these things on my mind. You can keep all these things in your mind and pray for them. l was saying it for your benefit. l have never prayed or worshipped god to this day. Brother refuses to bring home an alter. He says, Bina is my goddess Laxmi, goddess Saraswati... Ganga and Kali. l don't worship any other. Many times l told him to bring a small alter for my sake. He said, you are a goddess yourself... which goddess will you worship? Now how do l answer that? Ask your brother the answer to that. You ask my brother. He's a brother to you as well. No, no. So that's how it is. Okay, let's pray. l'll talk to god today into fulfilling your wish. Take me to your town Lord of Gokul l'd like to be lost in your thoughts l'd like to stay away from this world This place is a market of transgressions Lord of Gokul Take me to your town Lord of Gokul Keep showing us good things Show us the correct path Black clouds loom. Lord of Gokul Take me to your town Lord of Gokul Don't hide it. l've seen it. Who is that? Your Bina. And that? Him? Bina. Good girls don't play such games. Give it to me. - l pray she's exactly like you. - Speak to brother. l don't trust these rich men! Animals! Bina! Bina! Disaster has struck. - What? - A catastrophe. God is missing. How do you know? Oh god! What have you gone and done, Bina? Why? What's wrong? l wanted to speak to god privately. That's why l brought it. Bina, you've committed a sin. l don't know about that. l'm losing my mind these days. Look Bina, l'm cautioning you to take control of your mind... or else, god forbid, you'll fall ill. l already know that. Touch my forehead. Kusum, l'm going to bring medicine from the doctor. l'll be back shortly. Please keep an eye on her. l've been robbed. l destroyed. Run! Run! Someone picked my pocket! Run! Run! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Where are you coming from? lt's nothing, brother. Nothing. l was on the night shift. l got off just now. Night shift. So you refuse to quit your antics? No antics, brother. The night shift pay is higher. - Nothing else. - You should be ashamed of yourself. Brother, l would if l didn't get hungry. Listen, brother. How is Bina? She's the same. l'm going to bring medicine. Bina? How long has she been unwell? Three or four days. - Did the doctor come? - No, he didn't come. Her brother has gone to the doctor to get medicine. What medicine? Such medicine doesn't do any good. Such patients require a lot of care. The doctor should tend to her... and a nurse be here all day. That won't happen here. l'm taking her to my house. She'll have all that over there. But let her brother come back first. No need for that. When he returns tell him Mr. Rajender took her to his house... and he should come there. Leaving a patient like this even one minute... could be hazardous. Bina, don't panic. l'm taking you to my house. ln the car. Yes. What do you want? Let me help you. - He took Bina with him. - Who took her? Mr. Rajender. Why'd you let him take her? l tried to stop him... but he said to send you to his house when you return. Send me! Brother, l wasn't there. - Had l been he couldn't have taken her. - Lies! Even you would lose. What's this? - Father, l... - Damn father! Shame on you! The house was a refuge until now. Do you want to turn the house into a highway now? What absurdity is this? Do you want to disgrace me? Who have you brought off the streets? And you rendered her unconscious and brought her. Take a good look at her, father. - Such girls don't live in the streets. - l don't want to know! Take her back immediately. Please calm down. We'll discuss it later. No way! l'll create a furor! l'll set fire to the house! Take her out immediately! Okay, l'll take her away... but l'll stay at this girl's house until she recovers. What did you say? Wait, wait! - She's unwell? - Yes. - She's got fever? - Yes, a high fever. So what are you waiting for? Why you standing here holding her in your arms? Go! Put her down inside. Rajender! Call doctor Bhatia and tell him to hurry. Why don't you call him, father? - Please call him. - Very well. Hello. Hello. Who is that? Doctor? - Who brought my sister here? - Silence! - Silence? Why? - Look, Amar... lt's not what you think. No, no, l'll take her home. She won't get good treatment over there. She will. Who treated her when she got ill before? Who stayed awake through the night then? You? - l've brought medicine. - Amar... you don't understand. She was a child before. She's an adult now. She needs a nurse. No, no, no, no! She's still a child to me, get it? l'll take her away with me. l'll take her. She's still unconscious. Her temperature is 104 degrees. She could get pneumonia. She needs rest. No, no. Nobody in this world but l can bring relief to my sister. l'll take her with me. l'll take her with me. Wait, Mr. Amar. Listen to me. Mr. Rajender, if this girl is troubled so much... in this condition, she might not make it till morning. She might not make it? Bina? Bina... might die? Just like the rest of them. No. No. Okay, doctor. - What are you doing, brother? - l am vacating the house. Make some sense, brother. Where will you go at 3:00 AM? Anywhere. But l must evacuate the house by morning. What's the reason for all the hurry? Reason? No reason. l can't keep Bina here. lf l don't leave by morning... he'll come again and bother her. You're leaving over such a trivial matter? And with a patient? - What else can l do? Tell me. - Are you a small child? Why are you so afraid of him? Moti, l'm afraid because l might beat him in a fit of rage. And then he might die and there'd be hell to pay. Who would look after this girl then? You don't have to go into such detail. Just pick up your luggage and put it in my place and stay there. lf he comes asking l'll tell him you crept away at night. Where, l don't know.. He'll leave and you can return to your house. That seems to be a good idea. Let's go. - C'mon, pick up the luggage. - Let's go. Do you know where Mr. Amar went? Amar left the house last night. But he must have left a forwarding address. That's just the problem, mister. He didn't leave an address. l had only one support and that's gone. - Lord knows what will become of Bina. - You mean... Yes sir, they used to give me a few rupees a month. l used to manage with that. What will become of me now? God! Look, don't worry. Four or five rupees is no big deal. Here. Be happy, mister. May you enjoy the joys of youth. May you have many children. Find happiness. Just as you've pleased an old widow's soul. Bina. Come on, Bina. Eat your food. No, brother. l won't eat this stuff. You won't eat! You think l cooked this for myself? What can l say? l'm not hungry. Why won't you admit you've eaten at Kusum's place? What would l eat there? l went there for worship. All you do is worship. You don't talk to anyone. You don't know if it's morning or evening. You don't eat or drink. You sit in worship all the time. What's happened to you since your recovery? - l don't know. - lt's also okay. Don't eat if you don't want. Even l won't eat. Brother Amar, what's the matter? For the past fifteen days l've noticed... you've been lost in deep thought. By God's grace Bina has recovered. Recovered, like hell! Your sister gave her another disease. - Kusum? - Yes, Kusum! She taught her to worship. She prays every day and every night. She doesn't think of food or drink. She doesn't bother combing her hair all day. She's quiet all the time. She doesn't laugh or have fun. Even you've observed her. She doesn't have fun. She is not the same. She's not the same Bina. God knows what she's contracted. That's true. That's true. This is a very bad disease. Ask me how l know. Ask. Sit. My Kusum has had this disease for the past five years. And she still has it. The irony is that l know the cure. But poverty is a terrible malady. lf l don't have money to sate the stomach, how do l get a cure? Will you tell me what the cure is? Where can l find it? God knows, brother, but there's only one remedy. - Get her married as soon as possible. - What? Get her married? Hand my Bina over to a stranger? Why are you talking like a child, brother? Brother, the truth is, neither is Kusum mine nor Bina yours. Love and affection are good during their childhood. Once they come of age, they are like the bitter pill. Without marriage, there's no solution. lt's all a lie. What can you or l do about it? lt was something else when they were young. We could make them happy by giving them sweets and toys. lf they still didn't come round, we'd take them to the fair. They'd settle down. But brother, sweets and toys won't work anymore. Now they're better off in the rags their husbands provide. The finest attire their maternal family provides isn't good enough. Brother, that's why the elders say... sons are your own wealth... and daughters are the wealth of another. Sure, you love Bina very much but just bite the bullet... and get her married. Bina is grown up now. Have you gone blind? She's still a child! Bina! Bina! Bina! Bina! Bina! Look here. Look here. l've brought you something very nice today. Something you love. - What? - l won't just give it to you. lt's marvelous. lt's your favorite, but l won't show it to you. - l'll give it to you on one condition. - What? l'll give it to you if you laugh continuously for two minutes. Show it to me first. l'll show it to you if you first promise to laugh. - Show it to me first. - First promise me you'll laugh. Then you'll see it.. l'll laugh if you show it to me first. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Look, look, look, look, look. Your favourite item. Rouge. l was wondering what it was. Rouge? Rouge! Rouge! Rouge. Why? Don't you want rouge anymore? A few days ago you picked my brains for rouge. That was different. l'm not a child anymore. My Bina has become an old grandma. Amar. Come take a seat. Uncle, l wish to ask you something. How does one make a grown up girl happy? That's easy. Get her married. What? Get her married! Everyone talks about marriage. Uncle, did you buy your experience at the shop? Why don't you think before you speak? Son, l did contemplate before speaking. l have seen a lot more of the world than you. Like hell you've seen it! You call that good advice? Telling me to cut up my heart and give it to another. Gouge out my own eyes and give them to the blind. - Sever my head and die. - My boy... the irony is, even if you do all these things... she still won't be happy. That's right, uncle, that certainly how it seems to be. But for god's sake, uncle, please tell me another solution. Uncle, what will you gain if l lose my Bina? Why are you advocating marriage? Try to understand, uncle. How do l take the light out of my house... and place it another's home... and darken my house forever? That's true, son, but that's the way of the world. - What can one do? - What can one do? - Moti. - Yes, brother. There's something l don't understand. Which? Either the whole world is a fool or l'm the fool. Oh no, brother. Not you. Not you. The entire world is a fool. But what's the matter? What could the matter be? Everyone l approach suggests l get Bina married... swallow poison or die. That's it. Brother Amar, you won't understand this way. Sit. There's one more test. Try it and you'll know for certain. Tell me. Listen. Go to Bina and tell her... you don't think she'll get better this way. Apparently, she's fed up with this house. You'll marry her to anyone she likes. Just say that and remain silent. Watch how she gets better the very next day. And if she doesn't, you may punish me. Bina, l understand you're fed up with this place. l can get you married to whoever you wish. That way this daily problem will be settled. Kusum! Kusum! What? What? - Really? - Really. - With whomever you wish? - Yes. But how do l tell him... Hey Kusum, why are you moping? You think l'll leave you? My name isn't Bina if l don't personally make you a bride. Where will brother go? l just have to fast one day. Quit eating and brother caves in. l'm swirling, for l've grown up l'll go to my darling's home. l'll go to my beau's home My heart is no longer with my parental home l'm swirling, for l've grown up My friends and pals are married l am tempted Everything seems forlorn without you l am like the divine wind l'm swirling, for l've grown up l'll go to my darling's home. l'll go to my beau's home My heart is no longer with my parental home l'm swirling, for l've grown up Did you see that, brother? Do you believe it now? Sometimes your disciple can come up with things... that would cause the best of gurus to bow. Brother Amar, trust me, girls are like little rivulets. They don't find peace until they merge with the ocean. Forests, mountains, valleys and ruins... they cut through, go over, under, swirl and get ahead. They don't stop for anyone. They become calm the moment they unite with the ocean. Moti, l could never separate Bina from me. Then you are doomed. Why? Can't there be a way to get Bina married... and still live with me? Brother, you want a live-in son-in-law. That is difficult. Only the wealthy can find live-in sons-in-law. Really? Why don't l get... Bina married to you? Me? Brother. Brother. l'd rather you hit me with the shoe fifty times... - but don't tease me in this way. - l'm not teasing. You swear? But brother, l have no source of income. - The girl will live at your house? - Of course! Forgive me, brother. That was your first condition. - l forgot. -Pay attention to me, Moti. Bina will always stay with me. Certainly. Certainly. But brother, please don't complain later. You know what my line of work is. Everything depends on god. Don't concern yourself with that. l've thought that over. A cane works wonders. Okay. Okay. lt works, it works. lt works. My girl! My girl! Hurry up. - What is it? - Hurry, hurry, hurry. - Hurry what? - Hurry, hurry. - Hurry what? - Hurry up and make arrangements. What arrangements? Are you leaving this house? - Shall l pack your things? - l'm not leaving home. l'm setting up a family. - You swear? - l swear. - With whom? - l won't tell you that now. But you like her. - So why won't you tell me? - Make the arrangements first. How do l make arrangements? Where's the money? Money? Money? God willing, the money will be arranged. You need to do something. What? Look, you perform your worship... and the labor will be my department. - Don't you dare move! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. One moment, sir. Just one moment. - Why? - Just listen to what l say, sir. - What? - Sir, don't you love anyone in this world? - What do you mean? -Sir.... if you send me to prison l'll be out of trouble. l'll get my daily meals. But l have a sister. Younger than me. She won't have anyone to take care of her. Either she'll starve to death or she'll find a means to survive. Sir, you're aware there are bigger fools than me in the world. They'll push the poor thing into a life of sin. Can't you manage without stealing? Why don't you find honest work? Firstly, jobs are not available these days. And it takes a lot of hard work to steal. But it is bad. Very bad. Just forgive me this time. But how can you convince me you won't steal again? Sir, l swear l left the house today with a plan... not to steal ever again. lf l did, then god may punish me... by not letting me see Kusum married. l am in great need of money, sir. What need? You have to get your sister married? No sir, l'm getting married myself. You mean there are people in this world... who are willing to get their daughters married to thieves? - Tell me his name. - Don't ask me his name, sir. - You know the man. - l know him? l knew this was your house, sir. l recognized you on sight. - Then you must tell me. - Sir, it is your friend, Mr. Amar. What? - With Bina. - Yes. - Amar agreed? - He said so himself. - Does Bina know? - No. l saw you at their house once. What's your name? - Moti. - Moti. Listen to me, Moti. lf you want to get the money, not be disgraced... and your sister not to get in trouble... then you must refuse this marriage instantly, or else! Why are you preventing someone's settling down, sir? Silence! l know you don't love Bina, nor she you. That's true, sir, but she's a very pretty girl. l know. How much money do you need? Five to six hundred rupees should be sufficient, sir. You will receive six hundred rupees... but you must go and turn down Mr. Amar. Make arrangements to marry someone else. But sir, please don't mention this to Mr. Amar. - Very well. Go. - Okay, sir. - And look. - Yes, sir. Don't play dirty with me. Don't make the mistake of thinking you got away. Oh no, sir. l wouldn't dare. Goodbye. - Look here. - Yes sir. - You must do one more thing. - What's that? lnform me when Mr. Amar isn't at home. For sure, for sure, sir. He's still living in the house where he was before. Bye. But sir, which way should l leave? My umbrella and shoes are over there. - From where did you enter? - From the window, sir. - Leave from the same place. - What about the doorman, sir? Brother Amar, please come here. Look, please don't be offended. Will you tell me what it is? Forgive me for bothering you so early in the morning... but there's a reason. - Will you tell me? - Please don't be offended, brother. - Will you say something? - You're offended. - Will you tell me or not? - As you say, brother... but please don't be offended. - l can't marry Bina. - What? Marry Bina... Brother, please don't get angry. Listen to me first. l had a horrible nightmare last night. Brother, l say this for your Bina's best interest. Listen to me. Last night l dreamed... a ghastly man was facing me with a knife... and said to me, 'Moti, don't you dare marry Bina!' 'She can't be happy with you. l have matched her with another.' 'Someone she loves. He is a decent man.' 'He's rich.' 'He can provide for Bina all her life.' He said this and came towards me with the knife... and said, 'l'm warning you, you'd better forget about Bina...' 'or l'll kill both Bina and you.' That's when l woke up. l was scared to death. l felt like coming right then to tell you... but on second thought l decided to wait till morning. Now tell me what l should do, brother. Dreams aren't to be believed, you idiot! They're lies. Oh no, brother. My dreams always come true. l cannot marry. l once dreamed... someone would give me four rupees and fourteen paisa. - That's the amount l got the next day. - Beat it! - Brother isn't at home. - But l've come to see you. - You were unwell. - Brother will be annoyed. Please go! Please go! Please go, mister. Please go, mister. l'll leave in a moment. Bina, l know you're upset with me... but l'm not at fault. The day your brother brought you back from my house... l came here the next morning. The people here told me Mr. Amar left the house at night. l looked all over the city but l didn't get any news. Finally l gave up. Just yesterday l learned you were living in this very house. l came to see you immediately. Bina. The last time l saw you, you were unwell. God knows l thought about you all the time. l always prayed you had recovered. Mister, please go. l am still unwell. Go. Go. For the sake of god, please leave. You made me unwell. You have been a foe. Why did you come the first time? Why did you buy those things for me? Was it so l could see them all the time? So that l might give up food and drink? Make me sad? Bina. Did god make you a good man so anyone can kill you? What harm has Bina ever done to you? Tell me. Tell me. You won't say? l wish god would make you a bad man. Be quiet, Bina. For the love of god, be quiet. You don't know this, but l am a very bad man. l am a rich man, Bina. Be quiet. Enough. Brother is upset with you for this very reason. l cannot do anything now. Brother! Brother! Please beat me. Your Bina. 'l have matched her with another.' 'He is a decent man. He's rich. Bina loves him.' So what am l supposed to do? Mister Rajender, do you also love Bina? Bina is a very polite and good girl in my opinion. A good girl! A good girl! So you may take her away? So you may take her away? But what can l do if both of them love each other? My Bina has become very mature now. She's not a child anymore. She's fallen in love. And why not? Mister Rajender is a big man, rich, decent, good... and he has two cars as well. How does Amar get a car for his Bina? Right, Bina? What kind of talk is that, brother? - Doesn't my sorrow bother you? - No! - Brother? - Because my sorrow doesn't bother you anymore. Please leave forever, mister. Go. l... Go! Mr. Amar, l apologize. l made a big mistake. Here. l don't take back things l've given away.

People bless the corpses with death. Are they blind? Can't they see l am dead? l'm finished! God, you bless man with love. So why can't every brother in the world love like Amar? This isn't just! But what do you care? All you want to do is play games. Play. God, you are the protector of the world. Don't be offended, but you aren't a protector of the mind! You are immortal but do you have a sister like Bina? Ram! Ram! Why are you determined to die? My legs have given way looking for you all night long. l looked all over the city. Let's go home. - What do l have to go home to? - Have some mercy, brother. Come home. You have a fever. No, l'll go visit Bina. Ram! Ram! Look at your condition. - How can you walk in this condition? - No, l'll go visit Bina. - Brother... - No! l'll go visit Bina! Okay. Let's go, let's go. - Bina, do you recall the day we first met? - Yes. What happened, Bina? The gentle breeze of spring was blowing The cuckoo was cooing l was playing in a world of my own Laughing, singing and carefree Someone came to visit He charmed me and planted himself in my heart And then? l left my parental home with tears in my eyes l came to a strange place. l left my parental home How long? For how long will this place remain strange? Clouds of peace loom over this place, my darling How long? For how long will this place remain strange? The bee buzzes around the buds, kissing each stalk Showering pearls along every path My love has arrived How long? For how long will this place remain strange? Moti, let's go. Let's return. The rivulet has merged with the ocean. l'm very pleased. Let's go. She'll get upset if she sees me. Let's return. She is very happy. Sister Kusum, brother is so ill... and you didn't bother to inform me? What can l tell you, sister? He told me, 'Don't you dare inform Bina.' l'll create a ruckus. l'll leave home. When you sent the servant, he said to tell you he was well. You could have snuck a message to me. That's why l sent brother Moti today. Here, let me wash this. Oh no, l'll wash it. What has brother done? God, l've committed many sins to protect this innocent girl. But l can't carry this burden any longer, my lord. Please find a solution for me. l am a sinner, an idiot. l don't want anything for myself. But Kusum is your devotee. Get her settled somewhere nice. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, brother. By god's grace, brother Amar is better. l panicked when l saw his condition the other day. Yes, you had reason to panic. And you did a lot of running around. And for a rich man like you to put up in a house like this... for six or seven days is amazing. - What's so amazing about it? - That's very generous of you, sir. Sir, please don't be offended but you've forgotten your word. What? l don't understand. Let me explain. Look sir, you had your way but the money... l completely forgot, brother. You can have it any time you like. Can't we amend this deal? - How? - l don't want money. - Well? - Look sir, your problem is solved. Now you do something for me. Tell Bina to push Amar into marrying Kusum. He could never refuse Bina. You don't need to tell me this, brother. l'm aware of it myself. - Here. - Take it, sir. Take it. Don't take the trouble now, sir. And we'll talk about the money later. Brother, you didn't inform me about your illness. Tell me, if Kusum hadn't been here then... what would become of you? But you won't admit it. Why wouldn't l admit it? l'm very grateful to Kusum. What's the point of simply admitting it? lf you admit it... Why are you eavesdropping on us? Go. Brother, a house seems horrible without a woman. - Get married now. - No, l won't get married. Then how will you return the favor? ls that the only way to return the favor? You don't know this, brother, but she loves you very much. - But l don't. - You should be ashamed of yourself. ls this how you return her favor? l'm not claiming to be her foe. Foe or not, l would be happy if you got married to Kusum. Look brother, she's a very simple girl. God will bless you if you marry her. And l'm in great need of a sister-in-law. - But... - No ifs and buts. You must. And if you delay, l'll be very upset with you. What will you do if you're upset? The same old ploy. Hunger strike. And l'll send a messenger to tell you... 'lt's been three days since Bina has eaten.' 'lt's been four days since Bina has eaten.' 'She's getting weaker. Her face is ashen.' She's unable to get up from the bed. 'The doctors are distressed.' 'They say if Bina doesn't eat for another two or three days...' Enough, Bina. Enough. Be quiet. Be quiet. l'll get married. l'll get married. Sing cuckoo, sing. Sing a sweet song, cuckoo Open the door to my heart Sing cuckoo, sing. Sing a sweet song, cuckoo. Sing a sweet song, cuckoo. Sing cuckoo, sing Coming. Someone is coming... bringing a new message Tell me how to love Teach me the words of love Sing cuckoo, sing. Sing a sweet song, cuckoo What are you sucking, Bina? Lemon. Have you lost your mind? Doesn't it taste tart? lt tastes good. Thank god you didn't eat mud or coal. - Where is my Bina? - Don't panic. Everything is okay. - Where is she? - Come, come. Come, come. - Why are all these people so quiet? - lt's nothing. Come this way. Come. Why are they quiet? - What's going on? - Lord knows. lt's her first child. - God help her. - Her life seems to be in danger. - That's what l think, too. - Yes. What did you say? My Bina!
