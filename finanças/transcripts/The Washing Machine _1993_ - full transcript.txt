[♪ Claudio Simonetti's 'The Washing Machine - Main Theme' ♪] YURI: Wait please! Vida! Don't get out please! Vida! Vida, I can explain it. Really! Come on! I'm tired of your explanations Yuri. Vida, come on I'm telling the truth! Bastard! I bought it for our anniversary. And you had the name Sissy engraved by mistake? [SARCASTIC] It's a natural error. Vida, Sissy they sound so much alike. Okay, ask the jeweller. It was his mistake. I told him Vi-da. I hate you! Come on! Don't do this to me. Perhaps your Sissy got a bracelet with my name on it? Where are there others? Vida! Would you listen? Maybe you should be purchasing these in bulk! Yuri you'll save money! Vida... [GROANS] [ANGRILY] I hate you, you bastard! I hate you! [VIDA] Give me that! How dare you! [SHRIEKING] Bastard give me my...my wig! [YURI LAUGHS] I hate you, stay away from me! [VIDA YELLING] You understand? Stay away! YURI: Alright calm down! You just don't give up do you? I told you to get out! Go! But you still love me? Get off me. [ YURI LAUGHS] Stop. Yuri stop. [SIGHS] It's over, I told you. But I love you. Don't touch me. [PANTING] You'll have to believe me. There is no Sissy. Don't touch... Would I lie to you? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Don't touch me... It's just that... It's just that... [SIGHS] I deserve better. [HEAVY BREATHING] I think I deserve better. [HEAVY BREATHING] [PANTING] I promise you, I'll change the jewel. First thing tomorrow morning. [STRAINED] I'll buy you a better one first thing tomorrow morning. [YURI] Why create problems, where they don't exist? [HEAVY BREATHING] [MOANING] [MOANING AND PANTING IN BACKGROUND] [TRIANGLE CHIMES] [CAT MEOWS] Get off! [CAT CRIES] VIDA: You cheating bastard. I will not share you with anyone. Please, come on. I'm in love with you, don't do this to me. Stop! Get out! And take Sissy's bracelet with you. You want me to leave? Alright I'm leaving. But you're never going to see me again, darling. [TRIANGLE CHIMES] [LOUD NOISE OF GLASS SHATTERING] [CAT CRIES LOUDLY] LUDMILLA: Stupid cat! Get away! Now who's about to clean up all that mess? [SIGHS] [WASHING MACHINE HUMS] [SCREAMS LOUDLY] [LUDMILLA'S CRIES HEARD OVER ORGAN MUSIC] [CRYING] Help me! Help me! [GASPS] [YELLING] Stop staring at me! [CAT CRIES] [CAT MEOWING] A man... cut up into pieces and stuffed in there like soiled loot. He had a name inspector. It was Yuri Petkov. You're not going to deny that... You and the victim had a rather explosive argument last night? Alleged victim, Inspector Stacev. Ah, there being no victim? Yes... alleged We all know that couples always argue. Isn't that true inspector? Yuri Petkov, was a pitiful excuse of a human being. MARIE: A parasite... living off a woman's body. [SIGHS] My dear sisters, how low and ungrateful we've become! [CAT MEOWS] Have you forgotten who brings the real money home? [ANGRILY] Maybe it's you Ludmilla with your drums! Or is it you Marie with your blind people? VIDA: Have you forgotten who brought us the washing machine the refrigerator, stereo? Think whatever you want of Yuri. [ANGRILY] But where would you be living without him? Is this his permanent address? No. They wouldn't permit it. They? Your sisters? [WHISPERING ANGRILY] Yes. My dear sisters. VIDA: Ludmilla and Maria. [CAT MEOWS] So, no one has seen a corpse? Inspector? After our little quarrell I was restless, so I took some sleeping pills. VIDA: I slept straight through 'till six this morning. VIDA: Those pills always make me so thirsty. VIDA: Ludmilla! VIDA: Ludmilla! What is it? VIDA: Ludmilla, wake up! VIDA: Ludmilla, wake up! She's drunk again, just passed out. Oh my God! Help me put her on the couch. VIDA: Be careful! [BOTH HUFF AND PUFF] Ludmilla is going to drink herself to death. So we wasted all this time on the hallucinations of an alcoholic. Ludmilla is not an alcoholic. She's... VIDA: She's.... Our sister is normal. I guess... if you had seen a corpse you'd tell me. Inspector I didn't even know about Ludmilla's story until right before you arrived. In a jealous rage... You have a fight with your boyfriend. Then your sister tells us that he was violently murdered. STACEV: It's to your benefit that there's no corpse to be found. But then again we're dealing with the hallucinations of an alcoholic, aren't we Nikolai? I told you, she's... Yeah... Nice house. [BITTERLY] Yes.. VIDA: In his day my father was a member of the Nomenklatura. I mean... our father. STACEV: Are you listening to me? Of course I'm listening! So, in a drunken stupor this woman hallucinates that she saw a corpse in her washing machine! [IRINA LAUGHS] [CHUCKLING] That's what my days have become Irina... [STACEV SIGHS] What's happened to the people in this country? They used to respect our authority. I'm beginning to believe that political change isn't always so positive. We can always leave the country Alexander. [STACEV SIGHS] I'll go with you. Wherever you want. You know I can't afford to leave Irina [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello? LUDMILLA: Inspector Stacev please? - I'm sorry he's not available may I take a message? Oh! Would you please tell him that I'll be waiting for him at the palace of culture this evening? [LUDMILLA] I'll meet him in front of the box office immediately after the rehearsal. And who shall I say will be meeting him? LUDMILLA: Ludmilla Kolba The woman who saw the body in the washing machine. [RECEIVER CLICK] How did she get your number? So, then? Are you coming up? I have an early day. Goodnight. [GATE OPENING] You're going to meet her, aren't you? Irina, I never said that. [GATE CLOSES] Do you like it? Huh? I see. Yuri was a pimp for you, correct? Times are tough! Seems like everyone has another job these days. [MUSING] Hmm... Well, have a good evening! Or should I say, a profitable one. There's still no sign of him! And there's still no case... Really? But if you should hear of anything new... Something relevant. Tell me... What if Ludmilla killed him and later made up all this story about the washing machine. Listen, most people need a reason to kill somebody... ... a motive. I don't believe that your sister.... [BREATHING HEAVILY] Ludmilla adored Yuri. You know what I mean? VIDA: Why do you think she spied on us? Half naked, every time we came home. Standing in the shadows. [WHISPERING] Pretending not to be seen. [BREATHES IN DEEPLY] We could see her watching us, and this only made it more exciting. We would do things just for her. For her alone... and we'd make sure that she could always see us. [SEDUCTIVELY] That night, she was watching us... We were giving her quite the show. We could've sold tickets [LAUGHS] [WHISPERING SEDUCTIVELY] Does this ... excite you inspector? No. No? [VIDA BREATHES HEAVILY] What is it exactly that you want from me? [WHISPERING] What is it exactly... What can I do for you? [ORCHESTRA PLAYS UPBEAT MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING IN THE BACKGROUND] COLLEAGUES: Okay, bye Nicole! Bye Ludmilla! [CAR BREAKING] NIKOLAI: Inspector! NIKOLAI: Inspector Stacev? Did you enjoy the rehearsal sir? No I'm waiting for someone. Everyone's gone home. Even the musicians. Exquisite... Like your breasts. Like your nipples... Exquisite. Like you... We'll be late. NIKOLAI: Inspector! Inspector... About the Petkov case. What Petkov case? I just thought that I'd investigate? No one ordered an investigation. Substandard background sir! However we turned up something interesing, we know he's been arrested but his entire record is missing from the files. No one has any idea where it is, sir. [ANGRILY] What? I'm sick and tired of all the idiots in this department who can't keep a file properly! Nikolai, you find that file and get it to me personally! Is that clear? STACEV: If anyone wants me, you know where to find me. [BREATHES OUT] LUDMILLA: Inspector! How did you find me? LUDMILLA: I found these in Maria's room, they're from Yuri. Are all you sisters following me? They're addressed to Sissy. Sissy is short for Elisabeth, that's Maria's middle name. LUDMILLA: I'm not stupid inspector, Yuri was trying to seduce my little sister. Vida found out and became jealous, very jealous. I'm not wasting my time over childish rivalry. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Aren't those salads ready yet? STACEV: Waiter? Cheque please. Right away, sir. I'm sorry to rush you Alexander, but I've got to get these papers to court by two o'clock. What? [WHISPERING] How did she? The letters that woman tried to give you at the pool? Yeah... "Sissy, your scent inflames my senses and fires my hunger. "I long for you and cannot wait any longer..." She has your phone number. She follows you around. What does this woman want from you? [WHISPERING] Are you jealous? [DEEP BREATH] "My sweet beautiful Sissy, how can you do this to me? You arouse my passions, excite my desires... then leave me stranded, alone" Have her arrested! Alexander... I have a very bad feeling about this woman. [STACEV SIGHS] You must listen to me. Irina, I can't be concerned with three jealous sisters who accuse each other of a murder that probably never existed. Alexander, it's more than that! That woman had your wallet! Arrest her! That is, if you truly don't want to see her again. [ANGRILY] Irina, don't tell me how to perform my job! She committed no crime, there'll be no arrest. [CAR DRIVING] [DOOR CREAKING] [FLOORBOARD CREAKING IN THE DISTANCE] [MARIA BREATHS HEAVILY] What are you doing here? [YELLING] Maria! No! Don't shoot her! She's mine! Come here. Don't worry, it's a friend. He's the inspector. MARIA: Come here. What are you doing in Yuri Petkov's house? We were worried. We still haven't heard from him. I wanted to find out if he'd been here. [MARIA LAUGHING] Apparently not. Inspector? What if Ludmilla really saw his body? And what if, after she fainted, Vida hid the corpse? You're Sissy aren't you? How did you get these? I never answered them. [ANGRILY] Yuri is a bastard! He always wanted Maria! More than the others. But she never gave in to him. Never! But the tone of the letters, is rather intimate? Your "scent"? I gave him things to fantasise about. MARIA: But only to make him suffer. [VIOLIN PLAYING AND SINGING] ♪ Oh God let us adore him ♪♪ Ssh! It's Yuri! He wants both of us. She's beautiful. Isn't she? Lie down for him? You've never seen anyone as beautiful. Have you? What a pity... Really. She likes only sexy young students. Not tired old men. [YURI LAUGHS] There's nothing you can do well Maria. Not even when it comes to humiliating me. It's no wonder I want you so badly. [YURI CHUCKLES] MARIA: I never slept with him. But when he looked at me, it was like... like the way that you're looking at me now. MARIA: He wanted me badly and Vida knew it. It drove her crazy with jealousy. How crazy? You're the police officer... And Vida is my sister. I don't think I'll answer that. [ELECTRONIC DISCO MUSIC PLAYS] Excuse me? Something to drink, inspector? Yeah sure... Two. Anyone seen our friend lately? Yuri? No. But those parasites he calls business partners have been begging me to take over the club. Inspector, what Yuri and I had wasn't just a business, we had plans together. Dreams... You can't steal dreams. That doesn't stop people from trying. You never come to places like this do you, Inspector? [SCOFFS] Fake! Third rate forgeries. Yuri's writing was smaller, rounded. This is so feminine. She didn't even try and make it look authentic. Here, this is his real handwriting. VIDA: "Dearest, You're a lighthouse always drawing, bright. A beacon of light, in the darkness." Ehm, thanks. I can read. Who do you expect me to believe? Me. [GLASS SHATTERING] VIDA: That was easy. [GLASS BREAKING] STACEV: I'll do this one. Okay. This makes no sense. Hmm? VIDA: I can't find a thing. You know he kept this notebook, with all addresses, names, accounts, all handwritten. Someone has taken it. It wasn't me. I'm telling you the truth. STACEV: There must be something. Signature, anything. Did he keep money in a bank? I asked you if he had a bank account. STACEV: Vida? [Claudio Simonetti's 'The Washing Machine - Main Theme'] STACEV: Vida? [STACEV CRIES OUT] [STACEV GRIMACES IN PAIN, SHARP EXHALE] [VIDA LAUGHS] It's getting hot isn't it. [Claudio Simonetti's 'The Washing Machine - Main Theme'] [VIDA EXHALES] What is this?

Something new? Yes, we arrested a drug trafficker who brings in heroine by sea. Through Bergues, could be something significant. Well done Nikolai. There is more to it, sir. We got his notebook, several names are listed, one that you may recognise.. Yuri Petkov. The suitcase you took is also his. [VIOLIN SOLO PLAYS IN BACKGROUND] [VIOLIN SOLO CONTINUES] Good, huh? Yeah, great. STACEV: Listen... STACEV: Yuri Petkov, do you know him? Mmhmm. Well... get out of the pool will you? STACEV: Have you seen him lately? Inspector Stacev! Inspector! Inspector! LUDMILLA: Listen! It's important! Inspector! [SOUND OF CYMBALS CLANGING] [CLANG] Are you drunk or what? STACEV: You never seen a pair of cymbals before? What do you want? Now you listen to me. LUDMILLA: That night... When I went down to check the washing machine. Something was wrong. The door was jammed. I looked inside and I saw the water was all red. I had put nothing red inside. [LUDMILLA EXHALES SHARPLY] [CAT'S MEOW] STACEV: A dream? Another intoxicated dream. [DOOR SLAMS] You follow me home like a stray dog and harass my neighbors for another one of your preposterous dreams. Inspector! Don't underestimate the powers of clairvoyance. What! Haven't they told you? I can see into the future. Your future. Do you think I would've chased you all this way? If I didn't believe my dream! [STACEV LAUGHS] You're crazy! Crazy? Crazy? [CLANGING] [DROPS CYMBALS] No, only drunk. Or did that whore of my sister, Vida, tell you that I'm crazy? How dare you listen to her? [TELEPHONE RINGS] Stacev: Hello? Ah, Irina. No, no, I just walked in. I was at the station. In my office. Irina, why didn't you call me there? What do you mean they didn't put you through? No, no, everything is okay! Irina... No, no, no it's alright. STACEV: Why, did something happen? Oh no, what? I don't see what the pro - [LUDMILLA EXHALES] Yes, Irina, I'm fine love. STACEV: What? Yes, I'm listening. Me, seen on a tour bus? Don't be silly. No, Irina, I'm fine! For God's sake, I wouldn't be caught dead on a tour bus. Have you gone crazy Irina? You know you've...you've... Yes, but, you know... You've always known Irina. No I'm alright Irina. Listen, can we talk about this later? [TYPEWRITER] To make thorough and... regularly scheduled inspections... STACEV: of the area. Inspector? I told you to knock. Sorry sir, it's important. Knock. [KNOCKING] Come in! What is so important? It's rather confidential, sir. Go ahead. Well? I tried to reach you all day, sir. I took the liberty of searching Yuri Petkov's house. We found your fingerprints throughout the residence. [WHISPERING, ANGRILY] You idiot! If you thought that I was involved in some conspiracy with Petkov, you should have reported it to my superiors! Not tell me! How stupid you are Nikolai. Of course my fingerprints are all over the house, I was there on official police business! I didn't mean to imply... It wasn't your implications, it was... tone of your voice, Nikolai. My apologies. [BOTH LAUGHING] Stacev: In you go! IRINA: I can't remember when we had such a good time! STACEV: I had almost forgotten how enjoyable a night out with you can be! [LAUGHING CONTINUES] STACEV: I know work isn't a good excuse but I can't see any other reason. Irina, Irina! - Stop talking... We should do this more often! - Yes... [STACEV GRUNTS PLAYFULLY] [IRINA LAUGHS] [STACEV HUMS A TUNE AND IRINA LAUGHS] [DISTANT HUMMING OF A MACHINE] Oh Alexander! I can never leave you alone... STACEV: What do you mean? IRINA: Has that washing machine been on all day? It's leaking somewhere... [SHOUTING] No! Don't open it. [LAUGHING] Why stop being so paranoid Alexander! Not all washing machines have cut up corpses inside. [IRINA SIGHS] Something must have run... Something red. It happens to everyone. Just relax. It's alright. Irina! Tell me that I'm repulsive, tell me I'm disgusting, tell me I'm impotent! Tell me anything! But not that it's alright! Your compassion will kill me! Talk to me Alexander! [CRYING] Tell me what's wrong! [IRINA EXHALES SHARPLY] Let me help you! [APPLAUSE] [VIOLIN PLAYS] STACEV: We have to talk. I need to know what really happened that night. There is one thing that keeps sticking in my memory. That night... [CAT MEOWS] MARIA: Well, Ludmilla was still in her bed with her hangover. [MARIA CONTINUES] No one knew anything yet... Well... [CAT MEOWING] VIDA: Maria! VIDA: Maria, where is that old shirt that I gave you? You know, the pink one? I can't find a thing. It's so messy in here! What is? [ANGRILY] Vida! Don't you ever come into my room without my permission! You understand? Sorry... Ah! Got it! MARIA: Whatever it was... The cat ate it. The cat ate what? Yuri's body. Why did you throw your sister out of your room? Because of Yuri's letters? VIDA: And one, two, three, around... And up, and down! And a one, two, three... Okay, great. VIDA: And hold it there! And up and down again. VIDA: Very good! And let's keep moving those arms up! Up! Beautiful. Stop. VIDA: No shoes inside. I will meet you outside when I'm done. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] VIDA: Alright! See you tomorrow. Okay, see you tomorrow Sarah. -Bye! And don't be late. Vida: Remember! Ciao... Vida: Well... Gym coach during the day, call girl at night... Ludmilla plays in an orchestra... Maria attends the conservatory then escorts blind people. Nice family... No one can call us loafers. What can I do for you inspector? You can give me information. Well, I'm entitled to a lawyer. We all are. Were you jealous enough to kill Yuri Petkov? What? Who told you that? Maria... Or perhaps Ludmilla? They're both liars. Inspector... I loved Yuri Petkov. And I still do. Ludmilla, ask her if she ever loved her husband? Basil Bodev. Do you know how he died? How? How? He was Ludmilla's husband... Why don't you ask her? [TELEPHONE RINGS] [POP MUSIC PLAYING IN HEADPHONES] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in! Basil Bodev. Well... They accepted the wife's story without any questions. By the way, the wife? She's the drunk with the fantasy about the washing machine? Right? Mmmhmm... Ludmilla? [LUDMILLA LISTENS TO UPBEAT ELECTRONIC POP MUSIC AND HUMS A TUNE] We had an agreement! When you don't work, you do the ironing! [MUSIC CONTINUES] How am I supposed to go out tonight? It still hurts me. It doesn't matter! Either we do our parts as agreed, or forget about the club. Don't worry about the club Vida, well have people travelling miles to see our shows. [MUSIC GROWS LOUDER AS IT PLAYS THROUGH THE SPEAKERS] What's wrong? What if Ludmilla did kill him? No, that's not Ludmilla. Not her at all. What about her husband? An accident. It was awful for her. She was the only witness to her husband's drowning and you're not suspicious? Listen, his body was never found, but yes, she was there, while the stream carried him away. All she could do was watch. That's when she started acting a little crazy. Inspector, my sister has suffered enough. Alexander? [CAR HONKS] [CAR HONKING] Alright, we can go. Excuse me sir, we're closed today. Oh, please. [Claudio Simonetti's 'The Washing Machine- Main Theme'] Maria! This statue... is wonderful. Maria? Maria? Maria? Maria? Maria? Maria? [MARIA BREATHES DEEPLY] [Claudio Simonetti's 'The Washing Machine- Main Theme'] Come there, it's alright. Maria? Maria? Maria? [SHOUTING] Maria! [WHISPERING] I love you! What were you doing in there? Getting quite an education. [LAUGHS] You'd be amazing at how much you can learn at the museum. Don't worry, I'm not jealous. But, be careful. It's very easy to fall in love with Maria. [DOOR CREAKS OPENS] [IRINA EXHALES] What on earth are you doing here? I wanted to talk to you! I was afraid... - afraid of what? I've been trying to call you and there was no answer. So I was afraid that you had been with.... - another woman? Did I do something to make you think I'd betray you? - I know. I know you wouldn't betray me. But, you've been acting so strange lately! You don't realise it, but...Alexander! -Irina! I don't have a lover. [STACEV SIGHS] [ANGRILY] I have three! And each is more deranged than the next! They're sucking the life out of me. This is nothing to joke about Alexander... -For God's sake Irina! Tell me you are joking? I'm not joking. Just plain exhausted. I don't want to hear it. Fine then, go home! I can't believe what's happened to you. -You can't. [NOISE OF CUPBOARD OPENING] STACEV: Look! There Go on, look! And this is nothing! You don't know how many things I hide from you. [ANGRILY] You bastard! Yes Irina, this is the man you loved. The man you thought you loved. It wasn't love Irina, it was a habit, it was laziness. You know it yourself, we both know it. [IRINA CRIES, SHE HITS THE FLOOR] [CRYING] You're all I had in my life! [IRINA CRIES] IRINA: If you leave, I swear I'll kill myself. [DOOR SHUTS] MARIA: Hello? No... No we can't see each other again. Maria...Please. Please don't call me. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yes? Okay, I'm coming. Get your hands off of me, I said I didn't do it! Just leave me alone! Please... [INDISTINCT NOISE OF LADY SHOUTING] STACEV: So what's so urgent? The Yuri Petkov case, those two other there, tourists from Germany. They were in the house of the heroine trafficker when we broke in. NIKOLAI: They knew nothing of the drugs. They were there for some information. What kind of information? On a man who apparently took them for quite a sum of money. Yuri Petkov? -Mmhmm. [UPBEAT ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC] [INDISTINCT DRUNKEN SLUR] Please... YURI: Vida! Come on. It's time to go. Danke schön. It's over. She is mine. -Excuse me, you know it's our anniversary. [DRUNKENLY] Don't worry! She's mine. -All that life has to offer...Come on you're a lucky man! You don't have a jealous wife to accompany you... -She's mine! [GERMAN TOURIST RETALIATES DRUNKENLY] YURI: Yeah, yeah sure! We'll make it up to you!. NIKOLAI: A short time later the Germans found out why Yuri left them so quickly. Why? NIKOLAI: Because the money our man Petkov gave the Germans for their Deutsche Mark was counterfeit. [INDISTINC CHATTERING FROM MEN] [INDISTINC GERMAN] STACEV: Where's the connection? NIKOLAI: Well, that's the same night your washing machine lady had her dream. So the three sisters have been lying through their teeth all along. Did the Germans see him leave? No. They were so drunk, they could barely keep their eyes open. Thank you. How are you? Please come in, come in. I was just getting lunch ready. [LUDMILLA LAUGHS] Soybeans too, you know... meat gets boring all the time. [WORRIED] You don't look well at all... Have you been getting any sleep? Eat regularly? Let me make you a cup of herb tea. Yuri was seen entering this building at six o'clock that morning. It's true. He was here. I came down to drink something... and I heard a strange noise. [WASHING MACHINE RATTLES] You came back...

Even if it doesn't appear so we are still quite close. [WHISPERING] I will never tell you how I did it, or tell you why. [LAUGHS] You wouldn't understand. On the other hand, with no corpse... Who knows. [LAUGHS] Maybe there's nothing to tell. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [SUITCASE CLOSING SHUT] NIKOLAI: Mmhmm...Yes. Yes I know. Hey! Sorry. [ANGRILY, SHOUTING] Close the door!

[MELANCHOLIC VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYS] This is my favorite hiding place. Ludmilla and I came here as children. [INDISTINC CHATTERING] There are many more. He wants his suitcase returned? Last week we arrested a man with a suitcase full of cash and jewels. It was intended for Yuri Petkov. I kept the valise as a lure. Why did he have to use the three of you? We're the only family he has. Yuri wanted us to be closer. Closer...Forever. Did you enjoy yourselves at least? [DOOR CLINKS] [Orchestra plays Mozart's 'The Magic Flute Overture'] What are you going to do with the suitcase? Turn it in... To the authorities? What about the photographs...
