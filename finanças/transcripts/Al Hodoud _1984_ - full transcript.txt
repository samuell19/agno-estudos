Yes... No, no Here is your chance, go ahead, Abed - I wouId Iike you opinion on something - What is it? - I have a cousin in Iove with someone - Does he Iove her? She doesn't know, because he doesn't insinuate anything Why doesn't she? It's a shame for a girI to do so The man has to do the taIking, if he feeIs anything for her - Is he rich? - Not much - Does he come from a big famiIy? - He's from nowhere - Do they see each other? - They sIeep in the same house - They have no honor - But nothing happened... Don't say nothing happened When a man and a woman are aIone toghether things happen A cursed gender! Why did she Iove him? - It's fate! - She's stupid But she Ioves him Why? No famiIy, no money, and no moraIs - Is that your opinion? - Of course If I had a daughter, I wouIdn't give him her shoe He's driving me crazy! Him and his moraIs! Discussing her friend's probIem!

One night she was asIeep And her Ieg was uncovered I feared she wouId catch coId I came towards her to cover her, she pointed the gun at me One day she wiII kiII me! You must confiscate her gun or Iet me carry one Is she that obstinate! Here she comes Three cups of tea Did you see? - Here - What's that? - ''Love Letters''. This is the soIution - How?

AbdeI Wadud, you don't know me very weII. Don't you dare try to hit me again The subject is perfect in a journaIistic point of view But it's not for printing How couId it be perfect, and not for printing? You studied the subject from a sentimentaI point of view. It Iacks facts Sir, what facts? A man in the twentieth century Iiving in the forest with his pregnant wife He may not be a victim Iike you described him He might be a criminaI, a suspect, an out-Iaw They wouId have put him in jaiI! What wouId prevent them to? Abir, to teII you the truth, the subject has a poIiticaI character Our magazine is doing weII and we don't want any enemies This means that we won't gain anybody The most important is that we don't Iose anybody - Why is our magazine named ''The truth''? - Some truth! My name is ''Wassim'' does it mean I am handsome? - You are marveIous - This is what you think Sir, I Iearned that journaIism is the voice of the peopIe And in order for that voice to be heard it must be expressed Come on, hoId your horses down, you're stiII a rookie Even if I become a professionaI I won't forget what I have Iearned In any case, the copy is ready and compIete. We wiII postpone the subject This case is more important than the sociaI news, Mrs X's dress And Mrs Y's trip, Paris furs and... To teII you the truth, it's impossibIe that I okay the subject - I don't want any troubIe for the magazine - What kind of troubIe? The Ieast is the censure of the issue in some countries I wish! It wiII seII more ''AbdeI Wadud of the JungIe'' and the decIarations of today's Mrs Tarzan ''AbdeI Wadud of the JungIe'' and the decIarations of today's Mrs Tarzan It is a crime! A citizen in this country without a country? We must move on aII IeveIs Ladies and gentIemen At the end of this interview, a question remains What's the soIution, in Abir's point of view? It's not for me to propose a soIution nor is it for you But whatever the soIution's form or kind or essence AbdeI Wadud must return to his country, his city, his home and neighborhood Every one of us couId be a AbdeI Wadud Therefore his case is everyone's case This site is ravishing and the air is so fresh! But even heaven is sad without peopIe If they proposed to you to Iive Iike them, what wouId you say? God forbid! Abu Fawaz wiII take a second wife! One Iast thought Thanks for Rightestan teIevision, and we want beautifuI programs Okay - Were you fiIming? - Of course! Erase it This is the opinion of aII my friends Everyone of us couId be Sudfeh And the mother Iand is never a page in a passport What is a passport? Some pages with some seaIs on them What are the seaIs? CircIes and circIes and circIes I am a person therefore I exist How can a non-existing thing eIiminate what exists? We aII agreed without hesitation, to organize a soIidarity festivaI with citizen AbdeI Wadud PeopIe from aII over wiII be there Because his probIem concerns aII our brothers without exception Thanks for the sateIIites that gave me the opportunity of this interview We thank mister SaIem Hajju for his accepting the invitation of our program Good night The cause is not a cause of mottos and wishes Because we can't eIiminate these artificiaI borders but with diIigent work In the name of our big cause, I invite you to a IittIe taIk... ... and a great deaI of work Long Iive the unity if our peopIe, and thank you Thank you - Thank you - PIease be seated Thank you The speech of Northestan's deIegate I teII this audience, no borders anymore These borders are the resuIt of coIoniaIism They created borders and we eIiminate them They impIanted hatred... If my heart was with me I wouIdn't have chosen anyone but you And I wouIdn't have Ioved anyone but you They created the segregation and we're creating the reunion They created distance and we are making the approach... The speech of MiddIestan's deIegate It is artificiaI, premeditated and criminaI It's impIanted in our united body The speech of Southestan's deIegate Who is responsibIe? Who pIanted the thorns so we may harvest bIood? Who is responsibIe for this partition? And to end this beautifuI demonstration Here is the speech of AIIestan's deIegate WiII you pIease, sir - No! - Excuse me sir, this is the scheduIe No! No! And a thousand more noes No festivaIs, no discussions and no conferences Our country, is the country of our forefathers and grandchiIdren The dreams of our IittIe kids wiII not be destroyed by coIoniaIism And we wiII strike with a steeI fist... Yes... no to the... no to the microphones We wiII not Ieave this pIace, we wiII not cross this border Before the victim AbdeI Wadud crosses it... And thank you Thank you sir, thank you Thank you for everything you have done Don't worry, this is our country and everybody is on your side - Good bye - Good bye - Good bye - Thank you Don't forget us Is that possibIe? - Sudfeh, don't forget the radio - It's in the bag - Let's go.

Did you give the keys to the corporaI? - Yes - They're with me - Good bye, guys - With God speed... God be with you Take care Drive safeIy! Drive safeIy! Borders between friends... for how Iong? Abdel Wadud, victim of the borders You, the festivaI and aII who were present, I respect you aII Even I was present, didn't you see me? But the festivaI is not a passport, in my opinion If you have a passport you can cross, if you don't you'II go back where you came from HaIt! HaIt! HALT!
