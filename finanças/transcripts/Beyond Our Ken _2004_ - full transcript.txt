The singer? Right, he told you, too? He bluffed I asked him to show me their pictures But he said he didn't take any with her One time I went window shopping with him We saw Kelly shooting a cosmetic ad As they saw each other, they got awkward I think... Ken really did date her before Perhaps he didn't take any photos with her Now, she denies So, he regrets and became what he is now Idiot! Ordinary photos and nude ones are different If they were lovers and took photos together, so what? Posting her photos online after she got famous, to show the world that he slept with Kelly? Stupid!
