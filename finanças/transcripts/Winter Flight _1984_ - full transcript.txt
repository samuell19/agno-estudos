Thanks. It comes in pieces, anyway. I would've thought you were a bit old for making models. It's not for me. It's a present. Thanks, anyway, for, well, you know, picking it up. Any time. RECORDING: Hello, Mal. Hello, Dad. Just a quick letter to wish you all the best in your new camp. I hope your first week's gone well. Have you got your hi-fi set up? Oh, Auntie Rose and Uncle John send their best. And your cousins. Billy's got himself a job, packing. Well, it's a start. Anyway, that's about it. I'll send you a long letter at t'weekend. And remember, don't let them push you around, Mal. You stand up for yourself. And be a good boy, don't get into mischief. Well, not that you do, but, you know, keep your nose clean. Oh, and, by the way, that last one you sent me on black-headed gulls, have you got any marshes or sewage farm near you? Because they're probably breeding. You read up on it. Anyway, that's it for now. Write soon. This is your dad signing off. Bye, son. Bye, Dad. Hooker? They're not there, are they? Well, you can go looking for them if you want, but I'm not chasing firemen all round the camp! VEHICLE APPROACHES A word of warning. Any aggravation from the RAF Regiment tonight and I'll be giving you two a tug. All right, my lovely boys? The regiment is here to protect the camp, not to smash it up. We'll try and remember that, sir. Hm. Go and get changed and come back for a drink. Come on! WATER FLOWS WATER GUSHES MAL TURNS TAP OFF Sir! It's Saturday night, son. You should be out having a drink. I thought I'd do my washing. You're no good to the force if you can't go out at weekends and have a bit of fun, laddie! Go and let your hair down. It's all right, I'm happy staying in. You'll be happier with the lads! Go over to the club. Plenty of WAAFs about. Get some oil on your dipstick. Well, go on, then. Sarge. MUSIC BLASTS RAUCOUS CHATTER LAUGHTER Doesn't he know where he is? He's either brave, or stupid. I know which one he looks to me. I'd better tell him. Hi, love! How'd the model go? All right. Well, I haven't, er...you know. Yeah, I know. Look, I'm not being funny, but if I were you, I'd go to one of the other bars. Why? You're in the pigs' bar. Look, there's a bar next door. It's got carpets on the floor and nice chairs to sit in. You'll be able to read in peace, OK? Why can't I stay here? Because they're pigs! Half a lager, please. Well...! Thank you. Here! Excuse me! What's this? Oh, it's an encyclopaedia! Do you actually read this? Can I have it back? What do you read it for? Cos it's interesting. Can I have it, please? Do you remember everything you read? No. Why do you bother, then? You're just trying to get on, ain't you, son? Oh! So, you want to be a Rodney, do you? I want me book back! Don't let her push you around. Take it off her! Go on! Go on!

If you don't like it, then keep out of it. MUSIC BLASTS HE PANTS MUSIC PLAYS HE SOBS HE SNIFFS HE SOBS I tried to tell you. It's for pigs, that bar. HE SNIFFS I brought your book. Thanks. You're going to catch pneumonia. You don't want to let that lot upset you. They're not worth it. HE SNIFFS Why don't you come to my house and get cleaned up? Are you married? I live with my dad. Come on. I can do it. Hold still a minute. HE WINCES What's your dad do? He's an MT. Sergeant Bowyer. Keep your head down! Seems to be the effect I have on people. It's always been the same, even at school. I don't think you're missing much, not fitting in with the pigs. Maybe. I would like to fit in somewhere, though. Have a look in the mirror. OK? Yeah. Thanks very much. I'd better get back to the bar. I'll walk you back. MUSIC PLAYS Tell me something. Yeah? Why do you read an encyclopaedia? Cos it's interesting. Don't you like to know things? Like what? Well, anything. Like tonight, I was reading about starlings. How they live as a group, do everything together. Handy bit of information to know. Only a joke! Anyway, I'll see you sometime. Yeah. I was going to... Well, I thought we could, you know... As we've got on. I'm free next Saturday. You can take me shopping in Cambridge. MUSIC BLASTS You'll get a letter in due course. Thank you, sir. LOW CHATTER Get us some coffee, Murph. I've got a low fuel who needs to come in. What about 1-11? Alpha Hotel 104, climb to 5,000 feet, taking in 200. You're all clear, number one, for finals. Keep your fuel priority. 3308, you're clear for the flight path, descending. BIRDSONG LOW CHATTER There's a flock of starlings right on the bloody flight path. Now, we must get them to move in that direction, back to the fen. And in order to do that, we have to create so much noise that they'll feel unsafe and abandon the roost. The most important thing to remember is coordinated firing. So no firing until the signal. Wait till you see the flare. Malcolm, you know where to take the SAFA unit? Yes, sir. Now, then, where are we? Ah, yes! Now, look, the main concentration of birds seems to be here, up here, in this wood. I thought we'd deploy the main body of the force around to the west, and then perhaps George and Bernie, you could skirt around here on the north side. OK? HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE DOG BARKS OK. Just a moment, sir. LOW CHATTER BIRDSONG BIRDS SCREECH LOUDLY GUNSHOT What you doing here? I wanted to see you. You'd better come in, you look frozen. Thanks. I thought it was your job. Not killing them like that. Well, you said they had to be moved. Yeah. I'm beat. Tired? Exhausted. Your dad not in? He's round his girlfriend's. My mum's dead. Didn't I tell you? No. My mum went, too, when I were four. Oh. Rough. Oh, it was all right. Me dad was mum, if you see what I mean. Oh, there is a reason I came round. I got something for you. A present. It came this morning. What is it? Have a look. Handel's what? It's at King's. Oh, great. Them tickets are like gold! I'd better put them in me jewellery box, then. Just a joke. Thanks. It's a lovely present. You can have a kiss. It's all right. You don't want a kiss? Don't you like me? Of course I do. I like you a lot. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Have you been with many girls before? Well, you know, a few. How many? What about you? Have you, um...? No. Shall we try that kiss again? ORGAN RECITAL HE BEGINS TO PLAY RECITAL CONTINUES A letter. It's from SATCO. Bloody Saturday flying. Buggers up the weekend, mun! He's making an appointment for me to see the station commander! You jammy git! It'll be a surprise for Angie. Knock this back, kid. It'll make you feel better. Who was it, then? As if it isn't obvious. Can you give us another, Jill? I'll have the bastard, don't you worry, kid. I'll lure him up to me bedroom, get him to drop his trousers and do a home-made job with me pinking shears. It'll sort itself, Ange. It always does. Angie! I got a letter from the Commission! Angie? What have I done?! What, are you blind? Can't you see?! Oh, sod off, will you? Bleeding men make me sick! Angie? Angie, it's Mal. Angie, it's Mal. Are you there? Go away! What's the matter? Go away, please! I'm not going away, so you might as well come out and tell me. All right? Yeah. You? Fine, thanks. Just having a little chat. Is it something I've done, Angie? No. Go away! If I haven't done anything, why should I go away? Because I want you to! But what's wrong? Come on, Angie, tell me. I'm not going until you tell me. I'm pregnant. But you can't be, Angie! I only put me hand on it! SHE SOBS Whisky, please. HE EXHALES So, the penny's dropped, has it? She's really upset, you know. I know. So, what are you going to do about it? She can't have it seen to. Pardon? She's too far gone. So you'll have to do the right thing, won't you? Look, you don't understand. I do, Mal. I understand everything. I've seen kids on this camp barely 17 and carrying. And what does the bloke do? He has a chummy word with his sergeant and gets himself shipped off to Germany! Angie! Wait! Don't you want to talk? I've got nothing to say. I'd have thought you'd have plenty to say. I mean, I was under the impression I was the only person going out with you! It happened before I met you. When? Months ago. Then you must have known about it for ages! I got the test back today. Who was it? Someone I met. Who?! You wouldn't know his name! Try me! I don't know his name! Let me go home, please! You don't know his name? What kind of a relationship is that? The kind you wouldn't understand! Where you go to a party, get pissed, see someone you fancy... ..and you just let it happen. Look...I know what you must feel and I'm sorry I've let you down! So we'll just call it a day, all right? It's my problem. And I'll have to sort it out on my own! MACHINE BLEEPS Here's the dark horse. What? Cat's out of the bag now, son. What cat? Like your style, Mal. There's me thinking the only thing you've climbed up is a flight of stairs, and there's you quietly giving our Angie a pasting. You know, then? The whole camp knows, son. Got to love it. All that walking around with the encyclopaedia, touch of the old Clark Kent, eh? You ought to get yourself a set of bins. Complete the image! Well, everybody's got their own way. Too right, son! Come on, you can buy me a drink. MUSIC PLAYS Hey, Kel? So, what's your plans, then? I don't know. I haven't thought about it, really. Well, there ain't a lot to think about, is there? You either give the kid a name or get a posting. I'll sort something out. You can have a word with Hooker. He'll put you right. He's bolted so many times, he's only safe here. And Cyprus. I do what I want to do! I do! I do what I want to do! I do what I want! You don't own me! WHISPERS: Angie? Angie? Angie? Angie? Angie? Wake up. It's me! Angie? Don't make a noise, or you'll wake your dad up! I had to come and talk to you. It's all been going round in me mind. I just had to see you. I'm all jumbled! If I'd had the time, I'd have written it all down on paper cos it always helps if I can do that. I mean, if I can look at things on paper, it helps sort 'em out. You know, one, two, three, four, all the points listed, and it's OK. But I didn't, there was no time, so I'll just say it instead of writing it. Look, just listen. It's going to be very hard on you, having a baby on your own. And we've been going out together and I feel a certain responsibility. And I don't want to see you hurt or unhappy, and I think having a baby on your own will make you unhappy. And...and I know it's not my kid and you can say it's got nothing to do with me, but...I love you. And I want to marry you. And I think we could be very happy together. What are you trying to do - suffocate me?! Sorry. How'd you get in here? I climbed up the outside. Oh, Christ, Mal, have you gone mad? I just had to talk to you. Yeah, you certainly did that. And I didn't want to wake your dad up. That would have been difficult. He's around his girlfriend's. THEY LAUGH Well? It won't work. Why not? Because of this. The baby won't know I'm not its dad. And nobody else knows it's not mine, do they? So as far as anybody's concerned, you got pregnant and we got married. Does your dad know? He thinks it's your kid, anyway. Reckons I'm lying to cover for you. That's it, then. No problem, is it? Look...it's very nice of you, Mal... ..but no. Would you marry me if it wasn't for the baby? You're lying. There's even more reason to get married with a baby on the way. I'm not being married out of charity. It's not that, it's not! Oh, this is stupid! Say you will, Angie. Say yes. WHISPERS: Yes. And we'll tell everybody it's my baby, yeah? WHISPERS: Yeah. I thought I'd go and see the flight looie tomorrow, get a house organised for next month. It's too soon. Why? It just is. Thank you. It's more important getting married in a registry office before the baby than getting married in a church after. Not for me, it isn't. It is for the baby. Mrs Thompson, please. I'm not getting married looking like that! It doesn't matter how you look. It does! A wedding's special. I don't want to be ugly and deformed when I get married. I want it to be nice. Can't you see that? I suppose you're right. CHANTING CHEERING LAUGHTER You have got to put him right on a posting. You're the old hand! Anyway, what you having? Oi, you! Slag! Yeah. And when it comes to fallout, I'd sooner be with him than anybody. I only saw him the once! We had a drink, that's all! I swear to Christ, that's all! I won't...I won't see him again, I promise! I promise I won't! He's all right when you get to know him. You're drinking a lot. So? Starting as he means to go on, love. CHEERING CHANTING CHEERING Name? CHANTING You all right? Hey! He's well gone! Where you going? Ain't you coming back...? Goodnight, Les. Goodnight. Hooker! Where you going? Ain't you coming back for a drink? PASSIONATE MOANING ENGINE STARTS LAUGHTER Go on, Hooker! LAUGHTER PASSIONATE MOANING What the bloody hell's going on? My God. SIREN WAILS Come on, now. Come on down here, lad, be sensible. We'll talk it over, all right? Get the dog out. He's a bloody maniac. Fuck him. Come on, lad. Come on, lad, come on. Come on. Come on. Lad, get down off there. Bastard. Move it. Come on. Come on over. Watch the dog. Get off! Get off! Release! Right... You little git. DOORBELL RINGS I'll make you a cup of coffee. What's the matter with you? Mal? Mal, stop it. Please. Mal. Please. Have you seen this about the sub? No. It says here a Russkie sub was spotted in the area just before our one disappeared. It doesn't mean anything. It wouldn't surprise me. It says the chief of staff's been called back from Florida. I bet that's pissed the old bastard off. They're bringing forward the Minival. Who told you? A girl in operations. She didn't tell you we're going on orange, did she? When? Well, you're out on the tarmac. How many did you see go up this week? Yeah, lots. Probing all the time. They should look round where our sub went missing. I'm going to bed. Goodnight. Sleep well. Goodnight, love. Goodnight. I'll get him to phone you back. We'll need the lights on for this one. Keep the birds away so that aircraft can move without fear of damage. You must also carry your green and red cards. Have you got them? Yes, sir. Up-to-date? Yes, sir. Good. You're probably both aware from rumour control there's a no-notice Minival imminent. I don't suppose you know when, sir? Could be any time. So, cards on you and monkey suits close by. I don't want anything to go tits up in my section. During the Minival you'll draw arms from the tower. That's your first point of contact on arrival. There's no sangar duty for you so there's no reason ever to leave, except in the case of a nuclear biological and then you use shelter 103, OK? If you're too far away or needed in the field then it's headgear on, gloves on and crawl under the vehicle, understood? Yes, sir. That's all. Angie, have you got a minute? I've done a list on the table. Can you check it in case I've forgotten anything? Oh, I've put disposable nappies down instead of terries - saves on the washing. What do you reckon? Well, they've got to be bought sometime. You haven't got anything ready for him yet. You'll have to do it at the weekend. Do it at the weekend, all right? No. What do you mean no? What's going on? I've been meaning to tell you for some time... Well, what? The baby's going to be adopted. You can't have it adopted. It's ours. No, it's not. It's not yours. It will never be yours. I've told you - it will. Of course it will. We can have others, can't we? We can have our own. That baby's ours. He should be with his mum and dad. Get it into your head - just because you tell people he's yours doesn't make it yours. Doing it after the event hasn't made it yours. Nothing will ever make it yours. And that's why I'm going to do it. Somebody else's kid will always be around. Always be there to remind me I did wrong. I was a naughty girl. You don't know what you're doing, Angie. Look... I'll have the kid, all right, it will be taken away, we won't even see it. Then we'll get married, have a good time for a bit before we think about starting our own family, OK? It doesn't work, does it? I mean, apart from the fact that it's wrong, everybody thinks you're having the baby and I'm the father. We're getting married, it's all going to be legal. But if we don't bring it back from the hospital what do we say? How do we explain that? I don't know. We could say it died. You can't be serious. Look, I'm not talking about it any more tonight. You're just making me feel worse. We are going to talk. We're going to talk until we've sorted it out. It is sorted out, and I'm not talking about it. And if you don't like it you can piss off. Right, I will. And don't bother coming back again. I won't. And you can cancel the wedding. Yeah, all right, I'll do that as well. Halt. About turn. It's Colchester next time for you, smart arse. Sir. Go on, get out of it. In what seems to be an escalation in the war of words over the missing British nuclear submarine, sources again denied that any Soviet vessel was involved, claiming that such accusations are clearly designed to raise the level of international tension and prejudice any resumption of arms limitations.

You must relax. SHE SCREAMS It's going to be much easer for you if you relax. Where is she? I haven't touched her. Excuse me. I'm looking for Angie Bowyer. She's having a baby. They all have baby here. Well, I don't want all. Just Angie. She's in there. Well, can I go in? Only Mr Bowyer allowed. But I will be Mr Bowyer. I mean, she'll be Mrs Stanton. Look, I'm the father. You're not the fireman? Is there somebody here who speaks English? Very good English. Been to a fancy dress? Are you a doctor? Well, you guessed it. Don't tell me. Flash Gordon? I've come to see Angie. She's in there having a baby. That's what they do in there. Can I go in? No. Sorry, Flash. Husbands only. SCREAMING She's screaming. Can't somebody do something?

Made a bit of noise, didn't I? Not really. Are you all right? I think so. Where's the boy? In the nursery. Shouldn't he be with you? No. What about his food? They'll give him a bottle. Don't you ever get to see him? No. Didn't expect you to turn up. Well, I'm sorry about what happened. So am I. Anyway, I'd better get back. Thanks for coming, Mal. I'll tell your dad you're OK. Mal? You won't look at the baby, will you? Why? Just promise me you won't. Why? I just don't want you to. Why? Because... ..it's just that when it's inside... ..it's nothing. Well, it's something, but... ..but it's not real. It's just a bump. It's not a person, so it's easier to forget. If I see it... ..or you see it... ..then it becomes a person, doesn't it? And I'll never be free from him. Do you understand? I don't think you realise how much I'm gonna miss him. Even if I don't see him. Maybe I don't. But it'll be harder if you saw him. Had a picture to remember him by. Please. Promise me you won't. Yeah. I promise. LOUDSPEAKER: This is the station master. I'm calling off the exercises. It's been a very disappointing performance.

Yes. You're beautiful, aren't you? There you are. All nice and dry. Do you want to hold him? Can I? Is it all right? Of course it is. That's not Angie's. It is. It can't be. It's Miss Bowyer's baby. You don't have to hold him. BABY COOS He's lovely, Angie. He's our lovely little lad. It doesn't matter, does it? We could never have taken him back. We couldn't say it was yours. Then we take him back and say he's not. How can we? We can. That's how. Give him a cuddle. Subtitles by Red Bee Media
