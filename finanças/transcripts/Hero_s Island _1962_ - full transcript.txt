DEVON: Cullen, Jafar, stay with me! Come on! [CHICKENS CLUCKING] Here's the flintlock. Stand over the goods. Mind the boys. I see two, a man and a woman. There's more. On over the salt grass, down at the tide. They come from the mainland? There's your valley. There's Nag's Head, three leagues. North, open sea. Province of Carolina, six leagues. Cape Fear. This valley runs through to the sea on the windward side. I don't know about fresh water. We'll make it grow, Mr. Mainwaring. Devon, I worked land since I can remember, back to before you were born, but I never stood owner of it, never. I can't get to feel that I... That I own this. Oh, you own it, Mr. Mainwaring. You own it, grant and title. First thing, we sink a well. But that's not what you promised. You gave me your word. I keep my promise. I'll pick up the household. Mr. Mainwaring, I like this island! [CHOPPING WOOD] You don't wanna chop into our tree. He knows how to use that ax. You fight a man with an ax? No. No. There's a valley of greenwood over the rises, on past the salt grass. You see any snakes? I did not see any snakes. Is that all you got to do, is find fault? I saw a scorpion. You don't know a scorpion from a pea crab. [BIRDS CALLING] See those clam birds up there? They eat up all manner of serpents. Well, I'd like to see one swallow a full-sized copperhead. DEVON: Cullen, Jafar, we're gonna build a house, and we're going to work the land. Tend it and sow it and raise life out of it. Hold out your hands. White corn, wild carrot, and peas. Come look at the valley. Do you want me to bring the goods? Come look! It's beautiful. I keep my promise. Yes, sir, Mr. Mainwaring. Get down on your knees. Get down. God in heaven, I and my family, and my friend, Wayte, swear before the cross we will care for this soil. We will sow it with green grain. We will bring it to bear in the sweat of our faces, from early dawn to the dark of night. Are you the man? I am. You don't wanna stay here. You want to tell us your name? Gates. Enoch Gates. My third brother, Nicholas. That leaves you to tell us your names. Thomas Mainwaring. My friend, Wayte, wife and boys. Well, you don't wanna stay here on Bull Island. We got the right. Bull Island is private ground. Title grant signed by the landgrave. Landgrave's dead. Now, you put your paper down. Nicholas can't read, I can't read, far as I know, you can't read. Bull Island belonged to the Gates since the first ship. My grandsire, Lockham, cut timber for spars. Bled pitch and cooked turpentine right where you're standing. Look at the seal. Keep your seal. We got the right, right of discovery. Devon, read it. "All men know ye by these presence. "In this hour of my death, "I, Charles Hayward, landgrave of Great Savannah, "in the province of Carolina, "do hereby free from indenture "my true and faithful servant, "Thomas Mainwaring and his good wife, Devon. "And, as a reward for their strict devotion "through seven years of rigor, "I do bequeath to them sole title "to that part of Rose Hill Estate, "known as Bull Island. "Sealed up... Upon my hand "this 27th day of April, "Anno Domini 1718, "Charles Hayward, Landgrave." God rest his soul. DEVON: Amen. The Gates own this island. Not ye. Nicholas. DEVON: We got the law. Law's back on the mainland. Here's the law. You don't use that against a man. I do if I have to. Yes, hear. Go get your pots and pans. Take Jafar, I'll take Cullen, and go down to the rocks and net some mullet. There you are, boy. Hey, Wayte? Keep your eye on that fresh wood. Go ahead, boys. Get your hat. Break some wood for a fire. [COUGHING] Whoo. Oh, my. I want that ship here before dark. You told Dixey to be here before sundown. Paper don't give them the right. They got a flintlock. Servants. Same as slaves. Gates family fished this water since the first ship. Give me that. [BIRDS CALLING] Keep your eye on those fish crows. See that spoil out there? That's alewives. Mullets feed off of them from the deep. Come on, boy. You're the man! I told you, get off Bull Island! Now, get off! Cullen, get back on those rocks! Quick, run! Run, dog! Run, dog! Hey, Enoch, you don't want to stone a child. You'll kill him! Run, dog! One more. No, you'll kill him, Enoch! [SCREAMING] Let go! Let go. Come on, there's Dixey. There's the boat, see? Huh? See! Ah. Come on, you don't wanna stay here all night. Well, they got a wheel and some iron pots. And they got an ax. They got a good ax. Indentured servants? The paper read out they been freed. And you saw the flintlock? I saw it. You wanna go back there and clean 'em out once and for all? We did enough for one day. I'm talking to Enoch. Hey, Enoch, you wanna go back there and sleep out on the cold like an Indian raid? He wants a woman! He wants Sarah. Yes, you do. Dixey, that family won't be there after tonight. They're scared off. They ought to be back. I'll go take a look. We'll go with you. WAYTE: No. Those fishermen will steal our goods. You best stay here. Keep this. I won't use it. Just keep it by. [CRYING] Oh, God almighty. Mr. Mainwaring? Mr. Mainwaring? [ANGUISHED SOBS] There's roots down at this end. I want him to face east for the second coming of Christ. Lord God, I don't understand. I don't question, but I don't understand. Mr. Mainwaring was a good husband, a good provider. He led me, and I followed him in gladness. What are you going to do? Cook supper. No, I mean, are you going back to Rose Hill? No. Mr. Mainwaring wanted us to come here, gave up his life for it. I wouldn't want to leave him. You can go. I don't want to go. If they catch me back on the mainland, they'll put me in chains. What about the Gates family? They'll do what they can to get rid of us. I might have to shoot somebody. No. We ask for help. What if we don't get help? We'll get it. Mr. Mainwaring's gone. But the best honor we can do him is to go on, same as he was here. "G." "G." "As runs the glass, "our life doth pass." "As runs the glass, "our life doth pass." "G." "H." "H." "My book and heart..." "My book and heart..." "...must never part." "...must never part." "I." "I." "Job feels the rod, "yet blesses God." "Job feels the rod, "yet blesses God." "I." [BIRDS CALLING] Cullen, go get your mother. Tell her to bring the gun. [AX CHOPPING] Don't shoot! Who is he? A castaway. Dropped off or shipwrecked. Is he dead? Just about. He must have lashed himself to that raft. Is he Christian? Well, he looks Christian, from the look of him. I mean, I don't know if he's a parson. Where you going? I'm hunting birds' eggs. Well, you can't just leave him laying there. Well, maybe he ain't Christian. Well, we can take him up out of the tide. Ah, he's too heavy to lift. Well, get a rope and tie it around him and drag him. Like a dead horse? We'll help you. No, no! You don't drag a man by his foot. You'll choke sand in his nose holes. Slip it under his arms. Come, children, help. [GROANING] Get back down! [HEAVY BREATHING] You a Christian? Cullen, run up the keg and get some water! Take the ax! Run! Say your name. Jacob... Weber. What ship? The Exchange. You hold papers? Second mate. Man-of-war? In Jamaica. Out of Kingston. How'd you get cast away? Ship burned up. Full cargo of spirits. Spirits? Aye, rum. Maybe it's a good thing you got cast away. Twenty men burned up. This country Virginia? No, it's Carolina. This is Bull Island. It belongs to Mrs. Mainwaring. Is that a fact? That's a fact. Cullen? [EXCLAIMS] Cullen? Do you want to go up? He could've spilt the water and gone back for more. You! You strong enough to stand up? I'll try. You move ahead of me slow. Don't you stumble over your feet. You move too sudden and pa-koom! Now, where's your mama? All right, sit, sit. "G." "As runs the glass, our life..." Shh! I'll wail the pitch outta you. Cullen? Cullen? [BOX SHUTTING] You call out to her. Mama, go back! Cullen? Cullen? Cullen? Let my boy go! Go on, go to your mama. Be still! Stand to. Look, I'm sorry about your man. But for anyone can say, it was self-defense. You killed... Now, shut your mouth! We come up here to warn you, so nobody else gets killed in self-defense. That right, Dixey? That's right. Now, my brother, Enoch... Enoch stands head of the family, and he wants for you to leave Bull Island. He's sleepin' in the boat now. He won't wake up till past midday, and that's how long you got to pack up and go. No. Don't say no to me, missus, and don't read me no grant of ownership, 'cause Dixey knows the law. Law says you got to have a full workin' family. We've got a full workin' family. That your man there? You know where my man is. Over there, under dirt and rocks, wrapped up in a quilt. Well, who's the new one? He's, uh, he's a work hand. He got lost adrift in a small boat. Your man's dead, missus. You got to have a full workin' family. I got seven shillings, seven pine tree shillings my master left me when he died. I was going to leave them to the boys when I die, but I'll give them to you, if you go on and let us stay on here in peace. Pine tree shillings? I'd like to see that. They've been stole. By a thief! Now, missus, you best pack up and go home. My brother, Enoch, is set to wake up soon as the sun hits midday past that branch. That's how long you got before he comes up here and drives you like a flock of geese. Dixey? You better break that hammer off that arm. Don't wanna get picked off in the shoulder blade. We don't want Enoch to get a hold of this. No. [GUN STRIKING TREE] Midday, you best be gone. Midday. You, Jacob, go get some water. You give him some biscuits and pork, and maybe he stays on and helps out. There's no law says they can take land away from the rightful owner. Well, that's a fact. But sometimes it's right hard to fix who's the rightful owner. You bolt your food down, you give it right back up. Yip-yip-yip. You can't blame her. It's bad luck to meet a woman. You see that grave over there? That's her husband. Fishermen stoned him. What makes her think this island belongs to her? You know how to read? Spell out ship's log. I guess you do. He thanks you for the pork rind. He didn't say grace. WAYTE: Well, he was starved. An Anglican says grace. Well, maybe he's a Baptist. [GASPING] God help him. You think he's a criminal. Well, he says he's second mate. But his britches are made of quality whipcord. There's more to him. Could you see your way clear to let him look at the title grant? Prove to him that you're the lawful owner. Don't let him touch it. Oh, oh, I won't. Do you see any fish stew in there? You think it's clean enough for your mother? DEVON: Cullen, come here! Stand up straight. Heard your mother call, didn't you? Put it on your head. Go on, take it to her, quick. That's right. Ah, she's afraid you'll swallow it. Devon. That her name? That's right. What's your name? Wayte. Wayte Giddens. What's yours? I told you. Jacob Weber. If you say so, Jacob. I know better. You know better? You say you lashed yourself to that raft? Three turns of line around each wrist, four around each foot, and finish it with a runnin' hitch? A friend helped tie me. Hmm. A friend. Same friend that hung this shingle around your neck? What's that say, Jacob? Well, it says... That says, "Dead man." That ain't your name, is it? No, it's not my name. You use tobacco? For medicinal purposes. Go on, go on, I got 10 of 'em. Yep. I got six wads of Virginia leaf, too. [SIGN BREAKING] All right, sir. It's a bit dry, but it'll give off a rich fog. Here. All we want is some persimmon beer. Oh, don't let her hear you say that. Why not? She's got three books. She's got the Holy Bible, The New England Primer and Woe To Drunkards. A woman can drive you to madness. Shh. You mind scale those? Split 'em down and salt 'em. Uh, where's the salt? In the ocean. Well... You wanted by the Crown? You ever smoke rum in your pipe? I'm wanted. Did you poach some rabbits? I killed a man in England some years back. What does she think about you being a fugitive? Well, she don't like it. But me and Thomas has been friends a long time. Me and Thomas chopped cotton long before she come over here. Well, she may have the law papers, but she can't stand up against those fishermen. She can if she has somebody to help out. You mean fight? Little bit. Not me. I don't fight. The rule of reason, that's what I believe in. Can't see your way clear to help out? All I can see is to find me a ship to get back to Kingston. I'm on my way to build up a mercantile empire. I guess you are... If the law don't catch up with ya. What makes you think the law wants me? I know you. I know you like I know the weather, and my bones ache when there's a storm, and my bones ache when I look at you. [KNIFE DROPPING] Well, my bones are beginning to dry out. [SIGHING] I feel like I'm halfway back to life. Sun's getting close to that branch. Better tell her to move along. It's past midday. We better get these goods down to the boat. Wayte, we're not going. Well, Mr. Weber don't care to mix into a fight. I respect a man of peace. Thank you for the fish stew. You know how to make sea oats taste good. I use yarbs. Oh, yarbs. Savory, hyssop and pennyroyal. Mm. I'd like to try some of that in my pipe. Here's a coat for your back. You don't want to go around like a heathen. No, I don't. Take it off. Take it off. I'll let out the arms. That's my coat. I'd appreciate you don't handle it. [SIGHING] Now, what's the trouble? You takin' her part? I don't take part. All I want is passage to the mainland. I'll give you the passage to the mainland, with the others. They don't want to go. They don't? No, it's no use even to talk to her. She's got a hard mind. I don't talk to her. I tell her what to do. You get your goods, missus, you're goin'! DEVON: Put that down! There's no need to do that. You keep your mouth shut, you hear? Dixey, Nicholas, get rid of these goods. Don't, please don't! Don't, please! Please, don't! My books! [CHICKENS CLUCKING] ENOCH: Look. Look. Cut their heads off. Take 'em down to the boat. Don't cut them, don't cut them! [CHICKENS SQUAWKING] You men go with Dixey. Come on. Nicholas, take the woman. Take her by the neck. You hear me? I hear ya. Take hold of the woman. No. Now, look, I'll fight a man for you, but I don't take hold of no woman. You're gonna talk to me. When I get through here, you're gonna talk. Don't reach out for her. Stand out of my way. I'm asking you in reason. You tore up her books, killed her birds. Stand out of my way! No, sir. I'm standing here, and there's not too much you can do about it. Bullock... Take him away. [GRUNTS] DEVON: Look out! Back up! Go on, back up! Now, pick him up! Put him over your shoulder, and get him away from here. I don't like to kill a man, but if he comes back here, I'll split him and salt him! Get on, get away! [YELLING] You didn't mean that you'd kill him? I meant it. Not for sure. I meant it for sure. You know how to drill a cutlass! One, two! [IMITATING SWORD SWING] I served two years aboard the Royal George. Gun crew. Yes, sir. I know you did, if you say so. Man's got a cutlass, you got to kill him. You going to do it? Enoch'll do it. Enoch got himself an elbow belly. Gotta go kick over the goods, huh, Enoch? Huh? I'm gonna kill 'em. I thought you were dead. That man's a military. He's been trained how to fight. Did you see how he lunged and parried? That man's been to war. What'd you give up the cutlass for? Tore it off my hand. Dixey? What? You want this island? We need pitch, turpentine. There's always pearl oysters. Never come up with a pearl. Bull Island belongs to Gates. You don't know that. The Lord proprietors know it. Lord proprietors know taxes. Ain't no use, us poor fishermen fightin' a trained military, when we can call in a military of our own. The law? No. There's a steward up on Lady's Island that keeps order in the slave port. Carries a black whip. What's that whipper's name, Enoch? Kingstree. Kingstree. Kingstree, he won't come down here. You got seven pine tree shillings says he will. No, you won't call Kingstree down here. Give me the shillings. Well, you saw what he did on the slave ship, he cut the flesh off their bones. Give me the shillings. Here. Bullock, go get them shillings! You don't want Kingstree down here. No. You don't want Kingstree out here, no! Go on, go get 'em! Below the seats, go get 'em! You don't want him! Go! [SPLASHING] Enoch! Nicholas has turned against us. I got him hooked over the side. Let him go. Let him go? He'll drown! Let him go! Tie them glass floats around his neck. How many shillings did ya get? Five. [SPLASHING] Pull about, north-northeast... To Lady's Island. [WAVES CRASHING] Sure. Maybe I best take a turn to lyin' around him for when he wakes up. Never reach into a honey tree without poking a stick in first, because bears like to climb in. And they ease themselves down until the honey comes up to their chins, and they sit there licking their honey until they get so fat that they can't squeeze out. And you've got to be very careful what kind of a stick you use. I know a man who found himself a nice, big stick. And it turned out to be a whip snake. Have you never heard of a whip snake? No. Wayte... Don't you educate this boy? He's never heard of a whip snake. I saw one. Stole up on a man, tied him in a tree, and then he whipped him with his tail. Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip! And he didn't finish 'til sundown. That's whip snakes for ya. Did you ever visit the Big Dismal? No. Then you never saw a sora rail swamp bird. Well, when the cold weather comes, the sora rail, he flies down into the marsh grass, and he buries himself in the mud, and he stays there all the winter. And then, when the warm weather comes in the spring, he crawls out a bullfrog. I don't suppose you've ever seen a possum give birth to its young? Nope. Well, he blows them out of his nostrils... [BLOWING] Like that. Cullen, Jafar, time to go to sleep. Lie to a child? Oh, my. Oh, why? Oh, come on. Jafar, Cullen? Possums give birth same as a cat. Same as a cat? Now, I don't know about whip snakes or those frog birds. But I do know about possums. Same as a cat. But the young hang on their mama's tail, or go to sleep in her pockets. Pockums got possets? Go to sleep. Mr. Mainwaring, I do the best I know how. [MOANING] Jacob, come here. [MOANING] Prisoner's beginning to groan. Wayte's watching him. There's one thing I want to get straight between you and me. I wouldn't lie to a child. Any fool can tell how a possum gives birth, but a child needs to get stirred up. They're stirred up enough. No, I mean in their minds. They need to wonder. My father was a ship's chandler in Woodbury. When I was a boy, he lied to me 24 hours a day, never got a word of truth out of him. One time he told me he was the king of the moon. He was the king of the moon. I believed him. My pa was like that. He told us to hold ourselves high, told us we were people of quality. Aye. We lived in Houndsditch. Houndsditch? Had one baby brother, two baby sisters starved to death. Where did you learn to read? Church. Oh. The Minister's wife taught Bible. We belonged to the vestry of Challen Parish. You teach the boys? Try to. You know, I hear there's a school opened up, a real school for children's minds, up north in Raven County. That's one thing I want to see, a school where they let in bound labor. You're a free woman now, according to those title grants. Free woman. You know, for seven years, Mr. Mainwaring and I chopped cotton, pulled rice. We wore mule boots to keep our feet from sinking in the mud. Now we're free, he's gone. Did he bring you from England? He sent for me. You knew him? No. Oh? Mr. Mainwaring ordered me by contract. Oh. I cost two pounds, seven shillings. But he liked me well enough to marry me in the church. My boy Jafar is religious and lawful issue. What about Cullen? Cullen's not mine, not by blood. He was an apprentice poor child bound out to labor by the London Council. Cullen cost three shillings. You treat him as if he was yours. But he is mine. I've got the papers to prove it. You ought to be proudest of him. He is one I'm very proud of. My indenture, paid out. It's like a person torn in half. This half belonged to the landgrave, this part belonged to me. When your debt's paid off, they give you both halves. See how it fits together? That's the indent. One person, undivided. Oh, it's a nice night. [BIRD SINGING] Listen, you hear that? That's a nightjar. All I know is sora rail birds. Maybe you're right. Maybe my boys need some tall tales. I know some worthwhile things. I know, uh... Well, I know a ship's rigging, and, uh, navigation stars. There's Job's Coffin up there, see? Job's Coffin. Mr. Mainwaring has a quilt. WAYTE: Jacob, Devon! He opened his eyes. Did he say anything? He called me a name or two. I gave him a thump. Did they drop you overboard? How did youfind me? You were cast out by the sea. Like Jonah? You know the Bible. You don't live by it. Well, I don't hold with... Dixey and Enoch, all their noise. [LAUGHING] Fish, drink and fight. They ought to not break up your goods. They won't do it again, Jonah. My name is Nicholas. I beg your pardon. I'd like to cast in with you. I guess you would. They come at us from the front, and you come at us from the back. Well, you can use a man to help you fight. We're opposed to fighting. Amen. You want to risk your neck on account of a guilty conscience. You're a fine, noble man, Nicholas, and I don't believe you. What is it you want, Nicholas? I want to learn how to read. [WOOD DRAGGING] [BIRDS CALLING] [WATER POURING] Where's Jacob? They're, uh, off under a tree somewhere. [WATER STIRRING] Are the boys with him? They're learning about sora rail birds. They don't work, they don't eat. That's right, again! That's right! En garde, en garde. Let me see your position. Point your toe, point your toe. Now I'm going to split your brains out. [GRUNTING] That's good. Now cut my stomach again. Give me that sword! That's a boy! Aw. Get back to the field! Jafar, you get back to the field! You don't teach my boys to fight. Do you want men or field hands? Their father was a field hand, and he was a man. Their father is dead, Mrs. Mainwaring. I can take care of them, with help of God. God helps them who help themselves. Even the devil can quote scriptures! You calling me the devil? I'm calling you. I don't take that from a man, and I don't take that from a woman either! Oh, raise your hand, Jacob Weber! Oh, that's all you know! I tell you, if Mr. Mainwaring was here, he would stand before you, and with a look in his eye, he would teach you to respect! This is what I respect! [GRUNTING] I know you, Mrs. Mainwaring. A woman in Kingston, dead same as you. Bullheaded, hard-hearted, Yip-yip-yip! Nag a man to death, you're all alike. My mother to the street case in Barbados. You pick at a man's brains 'til they spit at the mouth! Don't raise your voice. Don't order me! Don't order me! You drove my father to the stools. You drove my brother to the gallows. You drove me to the Spanish Main! Oh! Devon. I forgive you, Jacob. Devon. I'm a widow in mourning. Let's go. They'd cut you in two, those overseers. You see that jug there by Kingstree's foot? We can't let him get to the woman. We can't stop him. We'll go to him, we'll tell him he's a great man. We'll give ourselves up. He won't hear ya, he's been drinkin'. There's no other way. We got to go to him. Lay an ambush. Three against six? Two against six. I've got more to my life than to throw it away over Bull Island. You afraid he'll take you in? You're right about me, Wayte. I've committed acts of violence against the proprieties, against the Crown. If they ever took me in, they'd put me to the worst death there is. You ever hear of peine forte et dure? Pain, strong and hard? I've seen it. They put you between two sheets of iron, and an inch at a time... They press you to death. Bullock! Now, we circle around and we drive 'em in like a herd of pigs. If you run into the cutlass, don't try to fight him. Leave him to the overseers. Cullen. Jafar. Now, remember to pray, and don't make a sound, even if it gets dark. Pound, Meggett, go in on the shoreline. Try not to kill anyone. Bring them to me. Don't move. Come on, come on! You've got to come! Come on! [SCREAMING] Aye, they got the woman. I sure hate to see her with Kingstree. [DEVON SCREAMING] [DEVON SCREAMING] [CHILDREN CRYING] Kill 'em? Take 'em back. It would be better to kill 'em, Enoch. Take 'em back! [GRUNTING] [WHIPPING] [SCREAMING] Kingstree! Run, missus! Run! I whooped him some. Is he dead? [GROANING] He's wide awake. Jafar, Jafar? Cullen? Maybe they run away, missus. No, I told them to stay here. Well, they're still alive. They'd be here, dead. Jafar? Cullen? Missus, miss, please! Missus, don't.Jafar? Please, missus. Please, I'm afraid for my life. We've got to go find them. Cullen? Jafar? Cullen? Wait, I'll go with you. Jafar? Cullen? Wayte, Wayte. What did they do to you? No use to tie me, Jacob. My left side's dead. That man with the whip sure earned his pay. Nicholas hurt him. Kingstree got the two boys. Jacob, we've got to save 'em. Don't move. Don't try to talk. Jacob, did you see the children? Aye. Kingstree's got 'em. Has he hurt them? I don't know, I don't know. Now, stay here, Nicholas. I let you fight enough. I'd have come down before. Instead, I stayed up at those rocks, and I watched! I'll go with you, Jacob. Don't call me Jacob, that's not my name. I'm not a merchant seaman. You know me, Wayte. You say your bones ache when you look at me. You know me. You know what I am. Pirate! I'm Major Stede Bonnet, sail master of Captain Teach. Teach? Blackbeard! You worked for seven years? I fought for seven years aboard the black corsair Queen Anne's Revenge. Revenge. Hear that, Wayte? Revenge. Revenge! I am the devil! Oh, yes, I am! I have lived in hell! I have wrecked and burned 100 ships, Crown ships! I don't pull a plow! I knew him. I knew him. Wayte? I'd like to try to help you make your peace with God. You want me to die a Christian. Even if you go away, I want us to be together. I'm not good enough. Oh, yes, Wayte, you're good. No. I killed a man. Please, Wayte, to save your soul. I don't have a soul. Oh, no, Wayte, I see it. I'm grateful to you, Mrs. Mainwaring. But I can't come up to being a Christian, not like you want. It's too hard. Not good enough. God bless you, Wayte, Christian or not. God bless poor Wayte. Uh, steward, you wanna take the children out of the boat? No. Keep them here on the shoreline. We can use them for bait. ENOCH: Steward? That's the man, moving along the cliff. You see how he holds the cutlass? Pound, hand me the boarding piece. Prime it. [GUN FIRING] Kingstree, I want the two boys! I know that man. He belongs to Captain Teach! Teach? You mean we've been fightin'... Major Stede Bonnet. There's a price on him. POUND: A hundred pounds. Pounds, dead or alive? I claim him. You're not to touch him, any of you. He belongs to me. Prime it, quick. Kingstree, I want the two boys! Pound, Meggett, get out there and put a knife to their throats. I know you, Major Bonnet. Drop your arm. Drop it, or I cut their throats! Oh! Now come in forward, Major Bonnet. Keep your hands out to your sides, way out, so you cast the shadow of a cross. Now, I'm gonna help him, missus. Not for his sake, I... I want you to have your children. Nicholas! No. That's what I want. Lord help me I don't get killed. Kingstree! [GUN FIRING] [CANOPY TEARING] [GUN FIRING] [SWORDS CLANKING] [GRUNTING] [YELLING] No! [ROCK HITTING SAND] Don't hurt him! [SCREAMING] [GUN FIRING] [GASPING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Who killed him? The woman. Oh, that must have cost her. Is it all right if we carry him out to the boat? Aye. Is Kingstree out there? Aye. Help me put the small boat down to the water. I'll pray for him. Nicholas, every day of my life, I'll pray for him. I want to look at him, last time. I knew I'd see him like this. Best get a hold of yourself. Well, bury him at sea, Dixey. Nicholas, you can come with us if you want to. No, you go on, I'll stay here. Bullock! Help me carry him out to the boat. I need your boat, get me back down to Kingston. You're free to stay here. No. Dead steward, two overseers. The law's bound to come look for them, catch me, punishment of death. Got to get my ship back. Queen Anne's Revenge? Twenty-one guns, sails up to heaven, and the black flag. You're going to fight? I've got to. My crew turned against me. They tied me to that raft, hung a board around my neck. "Dead man." That's how you'll end up, Major Bonnet. But I guess that's how we'll all end up, after all is said and done. You go on, do what you have to do. I'll stay here and do my best to bring up a family that believes in God, and believes in the land. God, and us and the land is all I know. God, and us and the land.
