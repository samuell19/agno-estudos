Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Okay. You haven't done this since we got married. Now everything has changed. You are going to be a mother. I don't want you to make any effort. From now on, I'll take you everywhere like this. Do not be silly. Happy Anniversary. You didn't remember. Neither you nor. - Dear. I'm sorry. - Okay. We're even. - Thanks. - Congratulations. - I never thought they'd make it. - Thanks thanks. Isn't it very nice to have neighbors like the Peppers? Oh yeah, especially if they bring us such useful gifts. Piper Heidsieck. The best of the best of Miller's champagne. Alice, these azaleas are gorgeous. Do not think that it will grow much, because it is too small. It will not develop. - Alice. - Yes? What did we do on our fifth anniversary? I don't know what you were doing, but they took me to the delivery room. Seriously? Oh yeah, it was Marge. No sweetie. It wasn't Marge, it was Ralph. Ralph? Oh yeah. I ... I meant, Ralph. Come on. And now. We have some great news for you. - What is it about? - We are going to expand our family. - How long have they known? - I knew they would finally make it. Thank you, thank you, but it's not that. We are going to adopt one. - Oh well. - Boy or girl? One moment. It is not that fast. We have just submitted an application to the agency. Rock-A-Bye. It was recommended to us by the Marshall. - Where? - In New Haven. We can stop at Yale and enroll him in the class of '79. You don't have to pay tuition in advance, right? I think it's wonderful. I hope you don't mind that we gave you as a reference. - Do we care? We are delighted. - Why. Sure. Oh Augie. I'm so excited. I can not wait. Dear. Take it easy. Take it easy. Look. They have thousands of requests for babies ... and each one has to be investigated first. It will be our turn, but you can take time. Has the doctor checked you and did all the tests? Oh do not. I'm still under observation. - We are hoping to have one of our own. - Sure. - They say that adopting a baby brings luck. - Oh yeah. Anyway, we are trying everything. We are going to exhaust all possibilities. - How hot. - Yes. You know, I remember the children. I know the camp is the best for them, but I miss them terribly, and you? In the least. Dick. - Do you read this postcard from Ralph? - I do not have to. I know what it says. "Send more money. Send more candy. Send more money." - That's a good fatherly attitude. - Okay... Hi Augie. Hello. Don't tell me you've been to town on a day like this. Yes. Not only that ... I had to stand up on the bus. And the air conditioning was out of order. Someone must have taken the ice bucket from the fan ... And drank it like whiskey Is Isolde at home? No. Maybe he went to see the doctor. He spends half his life there. Have you heard from the agency? No. Not yet. - Oh well. Do not worry. - I hope so. Hey, Augie, don't forget we have a bowling alley tonight. I'm not going. I'm dead. All I want is to take a cold shower and go to bed. Life is so ironic. We are going to have the fourth and they cannot have the first. She checks her fever every day. It has a temperature graph ... He goes to the doctor. Does not how many analyzes ... The poor thing is crazy. Yes. And it will end up driving Augie crazy too. If he had a little more interest, he wouldn't need so much analysis. Already. You see it very easy, right? Of course. You who don't like children ... all you have to do is look at me and I'm racing. - Hi my love. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm undone. He wanted to take a shower, but he was so tired. I also. I'm dead. I tell you one thing. I won't take my car into town again. Never. How smart you were to take the train. I was not smart. Smart you who took the car. Yes, but it was absolutely useless. - I couldn't find a parking lot. - Yes? So I left it in a prohibited place. Take. Thanks. "Illegal Parking". In the 5th. Avenue? $ 25 fine. But darling, I found what I was looking for. I bought a beautiful dress at Bonwit and also a beautiful mantilla. Very good. Now you have something valuable to pay the fine. - What time is it? - 5 o'clock. I forgot. My graph. Poor girl. It is definitely trying. If we don't have a baby, it wouldn't be her fault. Augie. Augie. Honey, I called Dr. Vancouver and he said that's a great symptom. Has risen. What...? What has gone up? I temperature. Ah. Yes? Yes. Do you get it? He said we have to hurry. Because I have to be at Dr. Vancouver's office in 30 minutes. And you have to take me, because you don't want me to make any effort, okay? - Oh honey. - Huh? Honey, uh ... Can't we put it off until tomorrow? Augie, no, we can't. Tomorrow would not be the same. Okay. And tonight then? Honey, he won't be in his office tonight. It is waiting for us now. If you're too tired to drive, I can call a cab. Darling, that's not the point. I am perfectly willing to take you. Well then what is it? Baby I've been in town since early this morning with terrible heat. People were dropping like flies. I left my footprints on the pavement. All I want is a cold shower and then go to sleep. All I want is a cold shower. Augie Poole, we are wasting valuable time. Dr. Vancouver will leave his office at 6. Come on. What does Vancouver think I am? ¿Flour robot? Augie, I don't understand you. I thought you wanted a baby, because you were willing to do anything. I am, honey. Anything within reason. Dr. Vancouver said: "When the temperature has risen to this point, tell your husband. And then come to my office in 30 minutes. " Oh, just like that, huh? "Here is the prescription. Hurry up. Stock it up. I'm double-parked. " Augie Poole, are you or are you not willing to cooperate? Honey, I want to cooperate, trust me, but you have to consider my temperature. You have to give me a little time. Baby you know I love you ... and I will do anything in this world to make you happy ... but I can't meet a deadline. ¿Doctor Vancouver? I'm Mrs. Poole again. I'm sorry, but I couldn't convince my husband ... and you don't have to wait for me. Yes. I'm sorry too, doctor. Anyway, thanks for trying. Goodbye, doctor. Dear? Baby I'm sorry ... but look ... I want a baby as much as you do. Maybe even more. You know it, don't you? You always said it. And you know how much I love you. Oh Augie, sometimes I wonder if just love is enough. I know. I have a weak character. That's true... But I warned you before we got married that it was a failure in principle. I told you at the time, that he wasn't a bold guy. My only point in favor is that I have never wavered in my love for you. But maybe you are right. Maybe... love is not enough. My poor thing! Dear. Why will I always have in my mind the idea of ​​having a child? Thank God you have it. Most importantly, we want a baby ... And if we want it enough, you'll see that sooner or later we will have it. So let's just chill and see what happens, huh? From now on, let nature dictate events. From now on, let me carry the signs. In agreement. But you have to promise me one thing. What? Never mention the word failure again. Even joking. I do not know, darling. Maybe it would be better to get a more productive job and forget about painting. Never. Never until the day I die ... I will allow you to settle for anything but what you want to be. If Van Gogh had married a woman like you, he would still have both his ears. But darling, we can't go on living on your grandmother's money. That's not very honorable, but it's running out. Do you think we made a big mistake buying this house? When we have kids, you'll be glad we're here. The city is not a place for children. Oh yeah. I guess you are right. But I loved our first year in town, right? Oh yeah. Do you know what I remember most vividly from those days? What? Those long unheated winter afternoons ... when we had to get into bed to keep warm. Doctor Vancouver, please. "At least our work has not been in vain. They will give thanks. " Hey This is a funny picture , Augie. You have never liked my drawings. Listen, buddy, I'm not an art critic . I'm just an editor. Why don't you just draw pictures and sell them? You could make good money. - And you'll need it when your son arrives. - Let him make his own money. I am an artist, not a joke writer. Well, as you like. Do you mind if I use your phone? A rhetorical question. Westport Arms? La Miss. Terry McBain, please. Hi Terry. Dick Very good. And you? Good. Good. Listen, Terry. I'm free this afternoon. Why don't I come over there and we can discuss your script? Alright baby I will see you later. Thanks my friend. A librettist lady, huh? Something wonderful. Just looking at her and my blood boils in my veins. In contrast to the usual route you need. Wow. I do not get it. A lovely wife. Three children... another one on the way and always on the lookout. Why? So that? I can't understand it. How I can? You are too normal. Wait a minute. That annoys me. Of course yes. You are like that plant. You need more space. More land. A bigger planter. You are never going to be an artist. You are denying yourself the emotional soil that your roots need. You are a tied boat. A tied boat ...? Because you mistake me for Luther Burbank. You only attack me for being too normal. That is a perfect example of double thinking. One thing does not contradict the other. Almost all normal people are inhibited. Stop, doctor, stop. Let me settle down. You know there is nothing as smug as a monogamous man. Mind if I have a drink? Another rhetorical question. Look what you've got. Wake up my tormented conscience. It's fine. I will call to cancel my appointment. And what does it matter, friend. What is yet another elk head over the fireplace in your life? It's okay to talk. You have never heard the call of the unknown. Drop that bottle! As long as you are my wife, never do that again. - Hi dear. - Did you call Rock-A-Bye while I was gone? No. You have to be patient. They will. - Investigator could be checking. - Do not. If they are to be investigated ... perhaps it would be better to moderate the parties and the drinks. Alice, we want a baby, but we ca n't eliminate Dick entirely. Investigated? Can they be hidden behind our backs without us knowing? Of course. They are going to assign a social worker to us. A woman with her hair in a bun and a mouth like a mailbox. A typical American. And let's ask ourselves what virtues she hoped to find ... in future parents and their guarantors. First, stability; the following, solvency. sobriety... and finally... chastity. Damn mouse. These barns. Everyone knows that my house has become a barn for mice. I wish I was back in town, where the rats come out and fight. - Hi, Augie. - Hello. - Are you going by bicycle? - No. In mice. Do you mind if I use your phone? - Is yours out of order? - Nerd. I can't call home. Another personal call, huh? Yes. I see that your tremulous consciousness has collapsed. It will take a minute. ¿Westport Arms? Miss Terry McBain, please? No this? No no no. No message. Thanks. You have directly messed with my morality and I don't like that. Look. I don't care what you do in your spare time ... but we are trying to adopt a baby. So as long as you are my reference, I wish you would calm down. I might also have Bluebeard feats. You are going to love the Pooles. Isolde is a wonderful woman, Miss Novick. And Augie is a sweetheart. Our kids are crazy about him. He would be a wonderful father. He is such a loyal and faithful husband. In fact... he and my husband are the only two men in Westport that I really have faith in. Good good. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Pepper. - Thanks. - To you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. lsolde. - lsolde, where are you? - Here. Isolde, come here. Come here. lsolde... She was here. - Who? - The researcher. De Rock-A-Bye. She is very practical and clever, but I gave her a phenomenal reference. - I hope it doesn't put too many obstacles. - Thanks. Where is she? - He's checking in with the marshalls. - Why? Honey, they always keep an eye on adoptive parents for the first year. That is until everything is legalized. It will be here any minute. You better change. You seem too masculine. - Oh yeah. - Wear something sweet and motherly. I know. I'll be a brownie leader. I'll put on my scout uniform. Alice. You have gone too far. You take advantage, little rat. You hide in my bathroom, right? Come here. The whole set of lousy mice. Wait for the exterminator to arrive. Mr. Poole? Yes. I can pass? Yes, yes please. Is Mrs. Poole home? He's probably getting dressed. I will call her. Who do I say is calling you? Estelle Novick. You come for more, huh? This time, you will not escape. - What is this? - Is a mouse. Do not worry. I will catch it. Bah. It is gone. He is trained, and I am not. That's the problem. - Mr. Poole ... - He ran away. Until he gets his second wind. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. I'm going to have one. I've been tense all day. What do you attribute your tension to, Mr. Poole? Probably the damn mice that don't go away. If we can't defeat them, maybe we should join them. I'm going for my wife. Hey, are you and Isolde old college friends? No. I went to school in Paris. I am doing social work, while writing my doctoral thesis. And why can't the doctor write his own thesis? You know, I've had this bottled joke for 10 years ... waiting for someone to say what they just said. This calls for a drink. Come on, let me make one for you. I never drink while I'm working. The Savings Community, huh? I am not doing it to save. It is a very worthy cause. I will make a contribution. We can use it for ourselves , in case any day the price of whiskey keeps rising. Are you sure you don't want one? It seems to me that most people drink to get away from something. What are you running away from with your drink, Mr. Poole? From the ravages of alcohol. Very funny. What school did you go to, Mr. Poole? I never went beyond high school. - How did it go on her? - Terrible. Everyone hated me because I was so popular. Tell me, Mr. Poole, do you like children? I am crazy about them. In fact, I am trying to adopt one. That is commendable. Do you realize what you are getting into? Of course I know it... and you can bet one thing: It won't be from any of these surroundings. I see you have your theories. I certainly do. How will you deal with a child who does not want to eat? Sending him to bed without dinner. How would you compare the problem ... of raising children from 1 to 5 with those from 5 to 7? What do you think is the most important period ? From 5 to 7. - Why? - Because that's cocktail hour. I'm sorry. Hello. Everything is fine. You may come in. May l? Thanks. I thought it could be private. No, it isn't, but ... Oh. I was about to have a ... I was about to take a shower. Ms. Novick, from the Savings Community ; Mr. Pepper. I'll be back in a minute, Miss Novick. Good. Good. Nice to meet you, Miss Novick. The Savings Community is admirable. I suppose you are about to call me. I live right next door. Hey, I take care of my charities at the office. Fall one day around 1, we can have lunch ... and talk about those things. How would your wife feel about dating like this? Would you like me to bring a note with her permission? If you'll wait a second, Miss Novick, I'll go get my checkbook. Don't bother, Mr. Poole. - Why not? I think you should know that your friend has tried to pick me up. Well, naturally ... But is that a reason why you ca n't accept my contribution? A flirt? You call that a pickup? Mr. Pepper, maybe it would be better to say who I am. - I'm from Rock-A-Bye. - Rock-A-Bye? That's the agency we're trying to adopt the baby with ... ¿Rock-A-Bye? It is right. That is why I am here. Refers to... You are the... Are you the investigator? I am, unfortunately. This is a disgusting trick. He told me he was from the Savings Community. I did not do it. Mr. Poole said so. Okay. Sure I told him, but that's beside the point. If you are going to be an investigator, appear as one. That aphrodisiac perfume she wore and that subversive cleavage. What the hell is this, an obstacle course? I'm sorry, Mr. Poole, but I'm afraid you don't have the conditions to be a good parent. And I guess it is, because he 's addicted to do it yourself. Wait a minute. Miss Novick. Please don't make hasty judgments. You don't know how much this means to us. I am a very loyal and faithful husband. Because I'm the laughing stock of Westport. I am very inhibited. - It is? - Yes. Mr. Poole. Do you ever think of children who are victims of broken homes? If I think about it. When I can't bear the thought of them anymore ... I think of the victims of blameless parents. Because I know parents right now ... that should be taken from the children. I'm sorry, Mr. Poole, but that's not my job. Good day. - Miss Novick. - Hey, can't you be a little more human? I made a mistake, but that's the way I am. A naive, playful, almost a child. Unfortunately, Mr. Pepper, you are not the one we are putting up for adoption. We are here, Miss Novick. This is Mrs. Poole. How are you, Miss Novick? How are you? - What is leaving now? - Right now. Mr. Poole and Mr. Pepper, they told me everything I needed to know. Are you not interviewing me? I mean, after all, I'm going to be the mother. It really is not necessary. Thanks. Goodbye. It's the strangest thing I've ever seen. What could have happened? Something must have happened. Okay. Nothing happened, dear. He was hunting a mouse and it showed up suddenly. - And you've been drinking too. - Yes, I had a drink. Why? And that? - Augie, what else? - Nothing more, dear. Frankly, I am very disappointed in Rock-A-Bye. I think we should forget about them and request it somewhere else. Rock-A-Bye has one of the best reputations in the East. Because there you get some of the best babies They go straight to Yale or Smith. Anyway, you are not passing over it; she is passing over you. I know exactly what happened. - You made a big fool of yourself. - Do not. - I can see you, running around half drunk. - I'm not. No wonder the woman left here in a hurry. Hey, Isolde. Honey, listen to me please. Leave me alone. Calm down, dear. Come with me to my house. And for this I put on this uniform. Augie, I'm so sorry. But he didn't know who it was. You said you were from the Savings Community ... and I figured it was time to have something from them. Are you off a world record? Can't let a lady pass? I've never gone after a woman ... Unless you send me a signal like radar I didn't notice any signs. Your extrasensory perceptions have been hampered by years of disuse. She lit up like a sign over Madison Square Garden. "The fight tonight." Are you crazy. I am not what she is looking for, but she is looking for. - Remember my words. - Friend... I was looking for my references. What are you trying to prove? You're right. What am I trying to prove? I've asked myself the same question hundreds of times ... And every time it all ends, I have a great sense of guilt. But you have to wait until it's over, huh? Of course. I think I deserve punishment ... And when I don't have it, I feel uncomfortable. So I try to regain the guilt, chasing it around. Why do you keep chasing him around, if he causes you so much trouble? I have to go back to that feeling of guilt. - You have to go back? - Yes. I have to suffer for chasing around. That is why I am going to an analyst. Does it tell you all this? No, I tell you. You don't know what I'm going through. - You could? - Oh no, no, no. Of course not. I am very normal. Normal? You, normal? You are even worse than me. Look to you. You are all shaken. Oh. I have a tranquilizer here. - They're safe? - Insurance, of course. It makes some a little sleepy, but they eat it like popcorn. That's why you're always so calm, huh? And you are totally knotted. - That's why you don't have children. - That's ridiculous. Yes? Let me tell you something else. You will never get anywhere , until you relax. You are not going to rest until you come out of its cocoon. Live a little. You're not going to hurt Isolde. That will help her. That will help both of you. According to your logic, what if I hooked up with another woman ... then would I have a child with my own wife? Okay. I don't guarantee it, but what can I lose? You're not going anywhere his way. Save these. You will need them more than me. Unbearable ass. Trying to get me to join your club in guilty actions. Well, they won't flatten me. I would love to know what happened there. There is more to this than meets the eye. - Hello? - Alice? Is Isolde there? Augie. Yes, it is there. - It's Augie. - Tell him I'm busy. - She's busy. - Well, I thought ... that he would go out to dinner with me. Just the two of us. He wants to go to dinner with you. Alone. Tell him I'm not hungry. I'm fed up Anything else? Is not sufficient. It's so unfair. Guilty by association. Wow. What are you doing here? Did you come to nail a complaint to my door? No. This is an unofficial call . - I can enter? - Look, Miss Novick. If you want to play Margaret Mead, go to Scarsdale. Please, Mr. Poole, I've been thinking about it. It was my fault... and if another reference can be found, we will reconsider your request. Seriously? That's wonderful, Miss Novick. Come on in. - I'm going for my wife. It's next to it. - Wait. I made a few observations about you as a parent ... But I want you to realize that there was nothing personal. Just my job. Personally, I think you are a very attractive man, Mr. Poole. I am? Deep down I knew you were warm and human, Miss Novick. Do not worry. I'll go for a flawless reference, even if I have to go to Bridgeport. Surely you must meet a good family man in this community. I know dozens ... eh... but if you're going to call them directly, I can't guarantee anything. Fine thanks. It does not matter. I'll have that drink now. - Okay. - I'm off duty. Good. A split personality, huh? Severe and threatening during the work day ... lovely... and feminine at night. What will it take? A double whiskey. Really a split personality. You know, Miss Novick ... it's hard to think of you as a man of science. I bump into it all the time. I bet it. Last year I was with a team of anthropologists ... and we conducted a study of sexual patterns in New Guinea. Yes. I guess there must be a lot of that there too. You know what, Miss Novick? What? With you I feel less self-conscious. He keeps saying he's shy, but I don't see any proof of it. Okay. That's the funny thing. I feel relaxed with you. Relaxed. You know what I mean? Yes I think so. It is what poets call the recognition shock. The shock of recognition. Yes. Maybe he was right. Who? Are you going to do something tonight? Not really. Me neither. What about Mrs. Poole? Mrs. Poole came out very angry. It left me to my own worries. Do you want to be one of my concerns, Miss Novick? We would go into town for dinner. I know a lovely place with an air-conditioned garden. We will lower the top of the car and let the wind run through our hair. In the interest of pure research. I want to be on your team. What am I doing here? How am I going to explain this to Isolde? Where am I going to tell him I've been? Why would I listen to that idiot Nick? Relaxed? I'm tense as a drum I'd better take another one of these tranquilizers. What's that? Tranquilizers. Do you want one? No, thanks. You're in luck, miss. We have one on the left. Thanks. Can you help me please? It's fine. Push it here. Hey sir. Hey sir. Wake up What...? What...? - Where...? Where I am...? Where...? - Yes, I know. Where I am? Hey, what place is this? TV Motel. It is fully air-conditioned. Where is it? On Route 22. How did I get here? Last night the manager said a lady brought it in. A lady? When he left? I do not know. I came at noon. - What time is it? - 2 in the afternoon. The time of departure. She left him a note. "Dear Mr. Poole ... the car keys are in the glove compartment. Thanks for a nice evening. It was wonderful. Affectionately. Estelle Novick. " Good thing you didn't hit the house, if you hadn't thrown it away. Did they bring the Sunday papers? Yes. Wow... no wonder we are full of herniated discs in this country. Take. Let's see what's new in the real estate section. Still searching? We still haven't paid the interest on the mortgage on this house. Only for curiosity. I like to see what they paid for. Hey, listen to this. "Westport. Old colonial mansion recently renovated ... with a beautiful mill and a pond located behind the house ... in a sunny jungle valley. " It must be from Bill Paxton's dump, with the swamp to the rear. You know why they are selling it, don't you? Not because? They are getting divorced. Yes? I thought she was one of the happiest couples west of the station. She caught him red-handed and with her best friend. - No. - Yes. Did anyone know? It is unforgivable. Of course it is and that's what she thinks. I always thought Ethel was a very broad- minded woman. Like you. Luckily you 're not like Bill. Yes. Darling, here is an article on adoption. "Can official adoption agencies meet the needs of hopeful parents? " I would like to write an article. The bureaucrats. Bureaucracy. It's been months since we requested it at Rock-A-Bye ... and we don't know anything about them. O en The Cradle or The Crib. We will make it, my dear. I am sure we will succeed. - Go. - There you have it. - Here we go. - Hey, over here. Go. - Let's go ahead. - Go. Shut your mouth kids, or I'll send a package of you to boarding school. It wouldn't hurt if you played with your kids from time to time. We have nothing in common. They bore me. Being a parent is feeding a mouth that will later bite you. Hey, Dick. Hi Augie. Could I talk to you for a moment? It is important. About what? Are you worried about something. Your jaw is loose, your eyes are glassy. You have a surprised expression . That describes exactly how I feel. It's fine. Come on in. Now shut up, or I'll send you to a reformatory. Look, Dick, I'm in a mess. A bad one. I feel suffocated, like I'm drowning. Come on, tell me. Do you remember the night Isolde left me ... and I disappeared and did not appear until the following afternoon? That was it, huh? I often wondered what you said to Isolde. I told him I got in the car and started driving to freshen up. Suddenly, without realizing it, I found myself in the Bronx. - So far I don't understand you. - I was going over the bridge ... that opens to allow ships to pass. And when I was going back, the bridge didn't go down and I stayed on the other side. The machinery broke down and I couldn't go back. Now I understand you more clearly. So I told him I had to sleep in the car all night until it got repaired. And did she believe that? Definitely. Why shouldn't I believe it? I've never lied to him ... ...before. - Amazing. What really happened? I went down the avenue. Not over the bridge. With a girl. Who? Do I know her? - You met her. - Yes? Who? Come on, don't be shy. Tell me now. Miss Novick. - Who? - You don't remember her? The Rock-A-Bye researcher. The hottie? Do not. Yes. A happy choice. Don't you think? I took your advice and relaxed ... totally with Miss Novick. Poor friend. Those kinds of women are not for you. It is out of your reach. You are not his type. Not with women like Novick. She is not for amateurs. It is for professionals. Stop protecting me. You're an extrovert from Madison Avenue. Okay, okay. I'm sorry. So what happened? - I dont know. - You do not know? Between the double drinks I had and the box of tranquilizers ... all I can tell you is that I woke up the next afternoon in a motel. In a motel? That is not right. Thanks. Now tell me. - And how long have you been with this? - It's just that nothing has been happening. I only saw her once a week ago. She called me and said she wanted to see me. So I immediately left for New Haven and asked him what this was all about. Y? You suspect that you are pregnant. How far? If winter comes, can spring be far away? Where is your Bible? It's a bit late for that. When I was a kid, I had superstition ... I could always get an idea of ​​how to solve something ... randomly putting your finger on a text from the Bible. Anything can be interpreted in a way that is convenient. What does it say? "And Lorbabel begat Abind ... and Abind begot Eliakim ... y Eliakim engendró a Azor." And it continues like this for a whole chapter. There doesn't seem to be any ambiguity about that here. - Maybe trying two or three times. - No no no. That's all. That's all. The question that comes to mind is, will she put it on your doorstep? For an editor and a man who is supposed to know English well ... you have not understood. I did not mean that. What does he expect from you? I'll do the right thing for her. Obviously, there is only one way: with money. So if Townsman still loves me, I'll sign the contract. - We love you. - Would you give me an advance if I sign? - One thousand dollars. - I need a check today. - Why? - I have an appointment with her at 1. - Here in Westport? Are you crazy. - She's leaving town. She's going upstate to have the baby. Can't you give me a personal check and cash it at the office? Okay, okay. You're not the scoundrel I thought you were. Here. Here's a blank check . Impossible. How did you do it...? From where...? It is impossible. Go. Don't start again. - Thanks. - Where are you going? - To church. - To church? There are no atheists in the trenches. I wonder where Augie is. Is late. Probably on the driving range hitting a bucket of balls or something. Frankly. I am worried about him. He's acting strange. In what way, darling? For one thing, he's never been so considerate or thoughtful. That is a new complaint. I think I know what is bothering you, but it's so unreasonable. You see, even though Dr. Vancouver has assured you over and over again ... it's not his fault that we didn't have a child ... thinks he's the culprit. Something happens to him. Sorry Sorry. Dick, maybe you could talk to him. Could you? Tell him that everything is on his mind. I will, I will, I will. I will try to convince him that it is not his fault. I think so. Hello. Miss Novick! How wonderful to see it! What a surprise! I was passing by and I thought I should say hi to you. Hello, by the way ... Arrive just in time for lunch. Mr. Pepper is preparing some steaks. Sorry, but I can't stay. Alice, look, it's Miss Novick. - Hello, Mrs. Pepper. - Hello. - He's beaming. - Thanks. You must be very happy in your life. Yes I am. Every day of the year. Do you know Mr. Pepper, our reference? Yes. - Would you like a cocktail? - Yes, thanks. - Everything's fine. - Dick? Dick. Yes. Ms. Novick, I'm so glad you're back. We had lost all hope about Rock-A-Bye. Finally we got rid of the mice, my husband is in the wagon, and I'm so excited I do n't really know what I'm talking about. My husband is going to ... honey! Come on, Augie. It's the usual crowd. Darling, Miss Novick is here. She came back. Is not it wonderful? Augie, we were talking about you. Weren't your ears burned? Hello Mr. Poole, nice to see you again. No, thanks. I think I had better drink some other time. I really must go. I hope we'll see you again, Miss Novick, or that we hear from you. I don't give them much hope ... but I know your case. They are going to have to be patient. It's going to take five or six months. Five or six months. Miss Novick, we don't really care. That's nothing, if we know there is a possibility. And they are saving three months in the regular process. See, honey? The reward of virtue. I remember now... I do not promise, but do my best for you. I think you are going to make a wonderful mother, Mrs. Poole. Thank you, Miss Novick. And before I send my recommendation, is there anything else you want to tell me? I can also be honest Even if it ruined our chances, Miss Novick. Our financial situation is not very good. But money shouldn't be a big deal, right? I want to tell you what we can give: Our love, care, devotion. That's what really counts, isn't it? Isn't it, Miss Novick? Exactly, Mrs. Poole. That's what counts. Dear... you can stop worrying. I just signed a contract with Townsman. Augie, that's wonderful. They are using their drawings. Well, it's not really my drawings. It's the jokes below them. My love, why did you do it? If we are going to have a family, I have to start making some money. My son must have the best. If you don't mind, I'd like to speak to your husband in private for a moment. I have some questions to ask you ... that could be embarrassing in front of others. Do you understand it? Yes of course. Go. Dick It was a pleasure to see you again, Miss Novick. Thanks. More than nice, Miss Novick. Impressive. Miss Novick ... What are you doing here? We were supposed to meet at church. There are four churches in town, but you didn't tell me which one. What do you mean that you are going to do your best? That's the least I can do, after all you've done for me. After everything I 've done for you? Yes. The check. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. It is simply a loan, of course. - I'll give it back to you one day. - Do not. No. I don't want you to return it to me. But i have to do it. I have told myself: I have a friend in Mr. Poole. And if I ever get in trouble, he's the one to turn to. Yes, yes, well. It's fine. But what about the baby? I'll take care of the baby too, of course. - Okay. Goodbye, Mr. Poole. - Goodbye. I don't think we'll see each other again. After my confinement, I go to the Australian archipelago. And I can't take a baby on that expedition. I have a better idea. You stay here and I go to the archipelago. Goodbye, Mr. Poole. Goodbye. What a ridiculous idea that is. A party for baby Poole that hasn't arrived yet. How do we know they will achieve it? They will get it. Isolde always achieves everything it sets out to do. Now remember honey. Don't drink too much tonight. Why? You don't have to bring me home. We are in home. Only remember. You are the host. Okay, okay. I promise not to have fun. How am I? I bought it last year and this is my first time wearing it. It's a lovely dress, my dear. Yes, and this time I'm going to get to use it several times. What a stupid idea. Have a picnic for a baby who's not even born. It's not just about our baby. Alice told me she was dying to throw a party now that she can show off her figure. - Yes. - Let me tie the knot. - You are very nervous. - No. I'm not nervous, honey. The prospect of parenthood has terrified you. - That is not true. - I understand you, darling. Under the circumstances, it is perfectly normal. There is no solution. It doesn't matter what happens to me. I am still normal. - How are you? - Nice to see you. - Thanks for the invitation. - I'm glad they came. Alice, Dick, they have been very nice. May I present Miss Gladys Dunne, actress. - Hello. - How are you? I've seen it on TV. I've tried testing it on TV to see if I like it. Ms. Dunne will perform at the Shakespeare festival. Yes. I am a fan of Shakespeare. While Shakespeare arrives, how about we dance? I'd love to. - Are you ready. - You start very early. Not your second drink? The waiting makes me nervous. Hurry, let's go. We should not be the first to arrive. If we don't hurry, we wo n't fit into the whole. Go. It's fine. - I'm good? - Great. - Hello everyone. - Hello. - Hello Alice. - Hi dear. - You are charming. - Thanks. - Where's Dick? - Go around. I've seen that girl on TV. Open all the refrigerators. She sure is thawing tonight. C'mon C'mon. - Excuse me, honey. - It's fine. - Hello Hello. - Hey. Isolde, you are adorable. - You too. - Thanks. - Thanks for letting me use the skin. - Isn't it divine? - Love it. - Dick told me to take good care of her ... because it's the last thing I 'm ever going to have from him. Hey, Augie. Hello. Augie Poole, Gladys Dunne. - Hello. - Hello. Are you originally from Westport? Yes Yes. What is there is my barn. Barns fascinate me. I've always wanted to live in one. Why not? I have hay fever. You can take out the hay and catch the mice, which is what I did. It is a fascinating idea. I'll send you some mice to get you started. You're funny. Suppose they give me a helping drink to get started. Yes ma'am. Let's dance first. Hello, Mrs. Poole. Dr. Vancouver, how are you? - No good. - That good. I have a bad cold, my chest hurts and I may even have a fever. Glad to hear that, doctor. What did he say? I would love to dance. Why don't we sit down? I'll get you a drink. It's fine. What will you drink? - Don't you know what I want? - Do not. Do not get bored. Why don't we go to the barn? You can show me your sketches. No I can not. I am the guest of honor. Then get me a martini. Right away. Pour me a whiskey and mix a very dry martini, will you? Don't overdo it, Augie. Quiet. I have to do something to calm my nerves. Alice's brilliant idea. I know. Any news from upstate ? Only this postcard. "I'm still working on it. Good. Estelle Novick. " Novick. A giant among women. Give him his credit. She had no one to help her, like Kinsey. He had to do his own research. From door to door. Hope it's dry enough. What is this, a lethal weapon? Strictly regulatory. Nine to one. This can bring me down And if I fall, I'm going to hold you responsible To me? Thank you, Mrs. Poole. I feel a little dizzy. I think I'll go to rest for a while. Why don't you do that, doctor? Thanks. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Looks like she's chosen Augie as her target for tonight. You can't blame Augie. She lunged at him. Yes, she has a lot more to throw at him than I do. And most of it is out in the open. It's a shame to see so much valuable space that you're going to lose. She should be advertising a product. She is advertising a product. A good kind of vine. I'ma tell it to grow on a wall and leave my husband alone. - Honey, they're playing our song. - What? You don't mind if I dance with my husband, do you? lsolde, I have never felt less worthy of you ... or needed as much as now. Augie, it sounds like something terrible is going to happen. Darling, nothing is going to happen to us. We are happily married. We will continue like this. - Let's make a pact now. In agreement. A pact. - We sealed it. - It's fine. Hey what is this? Kissing her husband, in full moonlight, huh? There is nothing bad. For that we are husband and wife. It's a wonderful party. I've done everything possible to keep my income from paying taxes. Hey, speaking of taxes. We got a strange email this morning. You know Townsman sent us an estimate for our tax return And there are thousands of dollars that I can't explain For or against you? They claim they paid us $ 12,000 and all I can add is 11. I thought maybe you might know something about it. $ 12,000? Oye... ... that's pretty good for such a short time. Yes, but you see, I'm a bit confused because we only get 11. Oh? Oh, I know what happened. They have set aside 1,000 for withholding taxes. Oh no, it can't be. We pay the tax ourselves. Oh. Well, you see. The fact is, I've been playing the stock a little bit. I promised Alice that I wouldn't. Well, she was right. I needed to get 1,000 and Augie left it to me. Oh. So you owe Augie 1,000. Yes. He never told you, huh? No. Not a word. So, Dick, you could give them back to us if you agree. I ... I completely agree. Wasn't it a beautiful party? Great. Goodnight Sweetheart. ¿Augie? I've been trying to adjust my checking account all day but it just doesn't add up. If the checkbook doesn't match, then the bank is bad. Good night dear. It can't be that I had a thousand dollar mistake. One thousand dollars? - Exactly? - Every penny. Hey, the bank is closed at night. Why don't you wait until tomorrow and call them? I already called them, honey, this morning. There is no mistake, Augie. Oh. I guess you'd better clear it up, honey. Yes? Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when for the first time it is deceived! Who was the one who told you that? The Westport Bank teller. Yes. The truth is, my dear ... that before he signed with Townsman, he had been borrowing from Dick. 50 here, 20 there. Pocket money, but you know how it goes up. Of course. Up to a thousand. I didn't want to turn to you for that. - So you turned to Dick. - Yes. Men certainly have a strong bond. We need each other if we're going to stay in touch with women, hehe I should have told you earlier. I guess it was my silly pride. It was silly, Augie. You know that whatever we have is both of us. I know that my dear but every time I left for whatever reason ... I felt like a hopeless failure . lsolde, you're not listening to me. I heard every word. You feel like a hopeless failure . Okay... Goodnight Sweetheart. Sleep well. Sleep well too, darling. All good, dear. Do not get up. Do not get up. I'll take it out. - What happens? - You know what happened? No what? lsolde cornered me with that $ 1,000. - He told you? - Yes. As I am telling you. I was a little tight when he cornered me. But I think I told Isolde ... that you loaned them to me to cover some losses. - Oh no! - But do not worry. She swallowed it. But if I told him that you had lent them to me. - Then she won't be calm. - No. He won't be. It's fine. I'll say I was covering for you ... because I didn't know that you had told him that you had lent them to me, right? Not even Alice would believe that. No, she does not. It's more. I'm supposed to give you a thousand dollars. Give them to me. I'm going to hold on to it until this is over. ¿Dartelos ...? - Give them to you? - Yes. You couldn't squeeze 1,000 out of me even if you put me in a Waring mixer. Give me a check with an advanced date. If I gave you a check, they'd bounce it from Westport to Port Arthur. Easy, honey. Baby oh baby Baby baby no That's not fair. There is no justice. Here I am trying to get 1,000 to have a child ... and you have one every year in the house. Good Guy. Dickie boy. - Alice. - Yes? Remember how I told you Augie was acting really weird lately? Okay. It is getting worse. You know how sloppy he is and he's always been distracted, right? Lately, she's been making me breakfast and she's bringing it to me on a tray. That could be the beginning of a nervous breakdown. Not only that, but he's talking to himself ... and shaking his head. Wow. If Dick ever serve me ... I would have it recorded or would have recorded it. It's great, Augie. I think I'm more fun when I'm hurting. ¿Eh? Do you realize what month we are in? Yes, it is March. The Ides of March. The moment is approaching. lsolde, what are you doing biking on these slippery roads? You're going to break your neck. Future mothers are supposed to exercise until the last minute. Look, honey, you have to stop preparing yourself. A million things could go wrong. We don't have the boy yet. - We have no response from Rock-A-Bye. - But we will. I know we will. Darling, you're going to catch a cold out here. Come on in. I'm going to make you some coffee. - It gets sweeter and sweeter. - Yes. We can learn a lesson from him. Oh, Dick, I spoke to Alice ... And she's going to give me the check for the thousand dollars. Thanks a lot. What? Richard, you should be ashamed of yourself. After the solemn word of honor you gave me not to waste time in the bag. - But I ... - This is a new stage: You lied to me. - Hello? - Mr. Poole? Yes. I'm Miss MacCracken from Rock-A-Bye. Who? Miss MacCracken from Rock-A-Bye. Rock-A-Bye. Mr. Poole, are you there? Yes. Yes. Here I am. Where did he say he was talking about? De Rock-A-Bye. Aren't you Mr. August Poole? Yes. I'm August Poole. Okay. I have very important news for you. Is Mrs. Poole there? No no no. She is not here right now. - Ask him if you can take the message. - Could you leave me the message? No. I think it's much better that you hear it together. I want to see their expressions. Now I am in town. I have to do some things. I'll come by later. This afternoon at five. Yes, sure. At five o'clock. Like I said, the Ides of March. It's just a routine visit. A prospect. Nothing definitive. It may not be your baby yet. Oh no. It's mine. It's fine. I can feel it. Dick, I swear to you. I'm going crazy. Suppose Isolde finds out, what is she going to do? - How is he going to find out? - You know Isolde is smart. Too smart. It would be different if it were Alice. He wouldn't know if you brought a lady home and put her in the freezer. I was never cut out to lead a double life. I couldn't even lead a single life. Augie, already torturing you. And the terrible thing is that I am torn. I want that baby. - What? - Okay. Why not? He's my son, right? It is a perfectly natural thing to love your own child. You're on your way to madness, buddy. If it were my son from a previous marriage ... no one would think such a thing. Yes. That is reasonable. Perhaps it is best to tell the truth and tell it all. Confession is good for the soul. Just in the sense that a tweed coat is good for dandruff. Hello. Augie. Augie, I came from Dr. Vancouver's office ... and he told me he has something for us: a baby. - Do you have it? - Yes. There is an 18-year-old girl. The ideal age for adoption. No. She is a girl that Dr. Vancouver has been taking care of ... and you think you can manage it. Great. That would solve everything. I mean, it wouldn't have to be investigated ... and all that nonsense. He said that she is a very healthy girl from a good family. The man must certainly be fine. He's a cadet from West Point. A good American boy. Honey, they are secretly married , but they can't admit it. Cadets are expelled if they marry before graduation. Sounds like the best option for me. I think the same. It just doesn't seem fair to Rock-A-Bye to me. Isolde, don't start lavishing a motherly feeling on an institution. We will take the first baby to appear. I will gladly take the first baby to appear. I'm going to tell Alice. You better get started on that black horse from West Point. Yes, but there is only one thing. I've always hated copper since I was in the Army. It is not copper. This guy is definitely a tall guy: Healthy, smart, alert. West Point. He could be president one day. How can a guy be president who does what he's done? Casting stone is not your trade, my friend. Why should I have to give it preference over my own son? What's wrong? Looking for more trouble? I myself feel healthy, alert and intelligent. And I'm not going to West Point with a letter from my idiot congressman. Oh. I see. Your own son. This is becoming your obsession, right? You read the Bible for inspiration. Let me remind you of something. When Daniel came out of the wolf's mouth, it wasn't because of his hat. What time is it? It's almost 5 o'clock. The only solution you have left is West Point. I better call Vancouver and check the odds. - It's almost time out. - Yes. This is Dr. Vancouver. Doctor, I'm calling you to find out about that couple you told my wife. That cadet and the 18-year-old girl. Who is it? I am Mr. Poole. I need to know something right away, doc. How long to wait? Mr. Poole, the situation has changed since I spoke to your wife. - Changed? - Yes. The boy's parents are going to take care of his wife and baby until he graduates. I wanted to call Mrs. Poole, but they have me tied up here. Well, thank you, doctor. I will tell. It has failed. Double crossover of charlatan. That is going to be a happy marriage. A gold bar on his shoulder and a 3-year-old boy on his lap. I'll take this lying down. Never ask who the bell tolls for. - Mr. Poole? - Yes. How are you? I'm Miss MacCracken from Rock-A-Bye. Come in, Miss MacCracken. I introduce them to Sr. Pepper. ¿Pepper? Oh yeah. The Poole reference. Don't you sit down? Thanks. Well, uh ... Do you have any news for us. Miss MacCracken? I'll wait and tell both of you together. I'll call my wife. lsolde. lsolde. What's up darling Can you come for a moment? I'm coming. Frankly, Ms. MacCracken, I wish you had been sent here first. Now it comes. She's my wife. Darling, this is Miss MacCracken from Rock-A-Bye. How are you? ¿De Rock-A-Bye? Ms. MacCracken, what is it, please? The first is the first. Do we sit down? Now... First, let me tell you, Mrs. Poole, we do our best at Rock-A-Bye so that the baby matches well with the right parents. Yes, I know. Yesterday, we received a baby ... that we think could be for you two. Naturally, I can't give you any details ... but I understand that the father is a decent guy, although somewhat weak and irresponsible. Ms. MacCracken, please, what is it? Is it a boy or a girl? We don't care, because we'll take it anyway , but ... A beautiful healthy child. She is eight pounds, with curly blond hair and big blue eyes. Right to order for you. Child. With curly blonde hair. It's a boy. When can we bring it? Today, if you want. If we want? Darling come on - Can we go? - Yes of course. We will take the truck. The heating is fixed. - Take the truck. - Thanks. Dick! I'll go get a basket and put some blankets on him. Nerd. I will do it. Miss MacCracken, we meet in the car. This is the best part of my job. Tell new mothers and fathers. He is so radiant. But you... seems surprised. I am? You must have made a great impression on headquarters, Mr. Poole. Me? Why? There were more than 200 couples in front of you ... and suddenly his name jumped to the top of the list. You are a lucky man, Mr. Poole. A very lucky man. There is a huge demand for our little ones ... and a very small part of the offer. You have to admit one thing. What? I finally defeated the law of supply and demand. Whats going on Son? Quiet. Quiet. Still. Quiet, still. Mom is not at home. Don't start again. ¡Alice! Alice, can you come here right away? - What happens? - It's the baby! Fast! Oh my god. - What is the problem? What's wrong? - He won't stop crying. - It's turning blue, look. - It's not blue. It is pink in color and it is likely hungry. When did you give him his last bottle? It's true, of course. I forgot about that. I'll heat up the formula. Wait a minute, little friend. Just a couple of seconds on fire. - You don't have a feeding schedule? - Yes. But I forget to write it down. Finished the fifth bottle an hour ago. I do not know what's happening to me. I can't hold anything back for two minutes. - Okay. What happened? - Nothing. The feeling of hunger. I almost called the fire department because of the way you were yelling at him. If I panic, I can't lower my voice. Call me for the next emergency. Sorry, Alice. Thanks a lot. When you go to town, can you bring me a packet of foo Yung eggs ... and some seedless grapes? Sure. And thanks for waiting until 2 in the morning. - What is it? - Alice is at the races again. - Congratulations. - Shut. - How are you progressing with the jokes? - I haven't thought of anything funny. I have a deadline to meet and nothing good has occurred to you? To hell with your deadline. I'm going crazy here. I have had four children and no one has seen me go downhill. Yes, sure, sure. Perfect. You're going to love this today, Augie. It is a new brand with a sensational taste. We cut it from the corn syrup and add a splash of Angostura Bitter. Isn't it good, little friend? Hey? I knew you'd like it, little one. I could stay all day, just staring at it. Let him breathe, let him eat. It is wonderful. It is a great spiritual experience. Very moving. - Leave him alone. Now he has to sleep. - Hey, Dick. Yes? I am scared. Scared? About what? - lsolde. She suspects something. - Yes? Every now and then he sees the child in the crib and then he looks at me ... Then he looks back at the crib, then at me. Like at Wimbledon. I can imagine it. When you take a look at the boy, the resemblance is terrifying. Yes. And your idea ... of this lousy mustache has not helped. It seems ridiculous. We have to do something to make Isolde not think about the resemblance. What do you suggest? Put a mustache on the boy? - Hello Alice. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? Hello. Beautiful child. - How have you been? - Very good. Well, I have to go. What is the problem? Don't you want to see it? - See who? - To the baby. You seem to make a wide arc around her every time you come. Of course I want to see it. - Who do you think it looks like? - Churchill. How are you? Is asleep. Where did you come from, dear baby? You came out of nowhere and walked in here. Where did you get those big blue eyes? You know it's remarkable. The girls are right. Since the baby shower, I've had nothing but phone calls exalting little Augie. - Yes? What did they say? - That it was a sweetheart. And that he never cried. He was looking at them with that funny little crooked smile. The way you are smiling now. They couldn't get over the resemblance. It's true. It is notable. It's amazing. I think it looks a lot more like Isolde. That little mouth, that nose. It's like hers. No no no. His mouth is much more like yours. Check it out. - I'll take him inside. - I'm going now. Do not go. I want to show you something. You too, Alice. Very good. What do you think of this photo? It is an enlargement that I have taken. Linda. It is stupendous. Even just by looking at the child. Is it a photo of the new batch I took? I didn't think it was so soon. Do you think it is a good portrait? It is perfect. - It looks like a little doll. - Better not come out. It is very interesting. See. It's not a photo of little Augie at all. It's a photo of the great Augie taken a few years ago ... when he was little Augie's age . You're not talking seriously? Okay... where did you get it? His mother sent it to me. He found it at his home a week ago and thought I'd like to have it. He said, "Don't show it to Augie. He's going to blush." And you are not blushing. You are pale I am? Okay, old Augie. You do not say anything? I know it. Maybe we all imagine that the baby looks like Augie, but don't tell me it's my imagination that Augie looks like that baby when he was the same age. - lsolde, I love you. - He's your son, isn't he? - It is not like this? - Isolde, honey. I know you love me and you are a poor helpless child. When I think you've been a despicable fool. How could I have fooled myself all these years? My kind, gracious and honorable husband. I never want to see you again, you lustful goblin. But you are not being fair. You're condemning this poor wretch without giving him a chance. He had his chance and he took it. Just give me 10 minutes alone with you, please. No. I'm leaving here. I'm sick of you, Westport, and the whole world. Where are you going? I don't know, but it will be to a city. To any city. I never want to see a tree or a blade of grass ... Or a piece of calico again while I live. For years they fight ... And just when you start to stick your head out of the water ... they throw the rug under you. It is logical. Up there, they look down and say, "How is Augie Poole doing well?" "He's doing fine." "Oh yeah? He's a slob." "What are we going to do, boss? Should we break his arm so he can't draw? " "No, you can't draw anyway." "Shall we give him a concussion?" "No. He has no brain in his head." "I know what we will do." "We are going to bankrupt your home ... and if that doesn't work, we'll do something drastic. " "Very good. They did." Hey, Augie. Still here? Yes. You know you are a fool to shave your mustache. It gives you character. Augie, in a way, I feel responsible for all of this. Why don't you let me talk to Isolde? With your record, you are perfect to do it. Stay away from her. It's fine. Stay here and sink. It is unfair. You can pick them up and throw them away like used razor blades. But with one time I slipped, I was pinned to the wall like a butterfly. You are right, there is no justice ... but you made a fatal mistake: you reformed. The unregenerate butterfly flutters from flower to flower ... without worrying about the world. Without? Why did you sit there and moan with me about your terrible feelings of guilt? Didn't you hear me? I have finished my analysis. I am completely healed. I can chase everything I like, without giving a damn hoot, ha ha. Good afternoon, Mr. Poole. Buenas tardes. I can pass? We are very... Sure, come in. It is adorable. The little rabbit. Thanks thanks. Is it going somewhere? No no no. They are from my wife. - Is she going anywhere? - No no no. Does not go anywhere. These are some things that you will bring to the center of the community. Packages for the poor. I'd say baby is a full time job. Yes Yes it is. She is with him practically every second ... but once a year he likes to do something for the poor. Wow. How are they adjusting to family life? - Well well. Very good. - I am glad to hear that. However, it is what we call probationary parents during the first year ... until the adoption is final. - Yes Yes. I know. Nice to have you come, Miss MacCracken. Come whenever you want. Thank you, but I'd like to see Mrs. Poole before I go. There's a cab waiting for someone, Mr. Poole. Probably a bug. It can't be for us. We have a car. Sorry. We don't call a taxi. You came to the wrong house, Jack. Mr. Poole, I must insist on seeing your wife, for a moment. Well, eh ... I'm going for her right now. I'll remove this from here. I guess they take that to the poor. We have a high standard of living in Westport. Mr. Poole, your lies are pathetic. - Lies? - You two are breaking up, aren't you? What...? Fortunately, the child is young enough not to be affected by this. I'm afraid I'll have to make a report to the board. Please don't file the report yet, Ms. MacCracken. I love my wife and she loves me. Give me a chance to fix this, please. It's against all the rules ... But I will delay my report for a week. Thank you, Ms. MacCracken. I can't tell you how grateful I am. - I hope I can fix things. - Thanks a lot. - I really hope so. - Thanks. - Goodbye, Mr. Poole. - Goodbye. Wasn't it my taxi? It is gone. I knew it. - I knew you'd do something like that. - I'm trying to fix it. Give me five minutes. What could you say in five minutes or in five years that will convince me? Baby I'm fighting for our lives, for our baby May you take pride in being open-minded and tolerant. You remind me of your mother. - That annoys me. - Yes. You are always attacking her for being narrow-minded and intolerant. What are you doing right now? Narrow-minded and intolerant like my mother. That's it. What happened to that free spirit that I married? It happened to her. I'm going by my own taxi. Isolde, I just want to tell you this. Love you. And I love him. And whatever happens, I'm going to provide the best I can. Get your hands off that child. Do you think I would let you raise it? To you? His father? lsolde, wait. Please do not do it. lsolde, no. No no no. ¡No! Baby, are you hurt? - Shut. - He came to me, head-on. - I did not do it. - Why don't you see where you're going? Your ankle. It's a sprain. It's the swelling. It's fine. - I'm going to call the doctor. - I do not need it. If you need it. Recharge in me. We will take you to the doctor. Sorry honey. Quiet. You will be fine. - You make me angry. - I'll give you a drink. You are pale. I am pale with anger. - Sit down. Let's look at that ankle. - Leave me alone. - That's wrong. I'm going for the tape. - Leave me alone. Don't bother with the tape. You're not going to touch me. Isolde, what are you doing? The worst thing you can do is stand up. - Now, come here and sit down. - Let go. Do not touch me. I'm going to put this tape on you whether you like it or not. You will listen to me whether you like it or not. - I'm not listening. - I'll start by saying ... that I love you. I have always loved you. I never loved anyone else. What are you doing to me? I have to do it hard if it's going to support you. - Listen to me. - I'm not listening. I had nothing to do with it. You had nothing to do with it? I mean practically nothing. I was a captive audience. Tonto. A slimy fool. It was that night that Rock-A-Bye was suspended and you didn't speak to me. Psychologically she was mature. We went to dinner. We drive to the city. On the way, she got hungry and we stopped at a Howard Johnson. I was not hungry, my stomach was upset. I would have liked something like a grilled lamb chop. "Could you bring a lamb chop ?" I asked the waitress. I didn't want to eat a lot. "I can give you the children's portion , if you wish." she said. "In fact, the lamb chop is our special Simple Simon dish." "Okay. I'll have that one and a bottle of beer." "And they gave me the first beer." I told. "I couldn't give you beer and Simple Simon." "If you are thinking of substituting beer for milk." she said. "But if you want to take the Simple Simon ... I guess it sounds very idiotic to both you and me, doesn't it? Plus. I will answer you this. If that's my taxi again, don't go to ... Good afternoon, Mrs. Poole. Hello, Mr. Poole. - Miss Novick. - oh. It's not sweet? Don't touch that baby. He is ours and we have the papers to prove it. I know it's yours. I brought it for you. What's the matter with you, Mrs. Poole? But, Miss Novick, why have you come here? Because I want to say goodbye and pay you back your loan. What loan? The thousand dollars, of course. My husband sold his book and got an advance. Here I brought you a dedicated copy. Tondo: The Story of a Savage by Rene Novick. That's my husband. I can't thank you enough for your kindness, Mr. Poole. I don't know how I would have had my baby without you. His... your baby? Yes. Here's a photo. A dear little girl. Yes Dear. And now that she is old enough , we will bond with my husband. Thanks again for everything, Mr. Poole. I must say we did a great job to match results. That's what everyone says. Well bye. I'm going to write to you from Australia. Are you not ashamed of yourself? Don't give me that. You had the conscience of guilt for something. That's true, my dear, and I deserved everything I have. But maybe you didn't know me as well as I knew you. He was a frustrated man. I couldn't sell my drawings and I couldn't have a child. Augie, I don't know how you did it. How did you change ... But suddenly I feel guilty, like it's all my fault. No, dear, it's no one's fault. Do not blame yourself. What happened has not changed me. I mean, what didn't happen hasn't changed my love for you. Can't you believe me? Augie, I want to believe you. I want to love you. I don't want to throw away the six years we have spent together. Dear. Not now, Augie. I am so tired. And I have a feeling of emptiness. You may be hungry. I myself am starving. I'll go fix something. There is nothing in the house except milk and porridge. Very good. I will go to town. What do you want? Stop at the Shanghai Gardens ... And bring me a double order of "moo goo gai" bread. All right, sweetie, okay. ¿Pan "Moo goo gai"? I've had an irrepressible desire all week. Honey. What other symptoms? - Symptoms? - Yes. What symptoms? I'm just starving. That's all. We were told that this usually happens when it is adopted. I have a feeling little Augie is going to have a baby sister. Listen, darling, let's put the house on the market and head back to town. The country is not a place to raise children. Our babies will be born in Manhattan, in a normal and healthy environment. And this time, I hope it looks like you. Augie.
