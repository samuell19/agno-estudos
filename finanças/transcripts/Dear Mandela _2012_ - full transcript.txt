[Mid-tempo jazz music plays] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Indistinct conversations] ♪♪ Sisulu: We're very proud of the achievements that we have notched up as the Department of Housing. I have believed in you. I needed to because when I got to Housing, I knew absolutely nothing about this. And my God, we have a long way to go. It is an endless, endless struggle that we face because housing is so much at the bottom of everything we would like to achieve when we talk about pushing back the frontiers of poverty. We're dealing with people who are increasingly seeing opportunities for themselves reflected in urban areas and leaving in their droves from the rural areas. Our rate of urbanization is far beyond what any government can cope with. Especially a government that's just come into, you know, into place. 15 years is a very short time. Ultimately we are committed to ensuring that each and every person has a house. Nobody in the world forced us to do that. It is part of what we decided we were going to do because we believe our people deserve that. That's what they fought for. It is enshrined in the founding documents of my own political party. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Indistinct talking] [Cheering] Before the election, we promised that we are going to build houses for you. I warned then that to do these things is not something that we can achieve overnight. It is going to take a year, and even as much as five years. Don't expect us to do miracles. We are ordinary human beings. [Singing in Zulu] [Whistling] Man: Thank you for joining us. Man #2: Good afternoon. Good afternoon to you.

The public at large has a very real interest in ensuring that the homeless aren't unconstitutionally evicted from their homes. Here owners are being obliged, maybe against their will, to evict, and nothing appears to me to be there in the act to ensure that anybody is directly responsible for ensuring alternative accommodation. What you have heard this morning, we respectfully submit, is time and again, with respect to our learned friends, a very obdurate and, by resort to Winnie the Pooh, I would say Eeyore-ish, pessimistic assessment at every turn of how the statute is properly to be read.

I was hoping to come here today and be able to, um, discuss a judgment in the Slums Act case with you. But unfortunately the court isn't handing down the judgment as quickly as we would like. But if we -- as we hope we are -- are successful, not only will it stop the act from being harmful and stop it from being used to evict thousands of people all at once, but it will also demonstrate to government that if they don't want to be sued, they better start participating and consulting meaningfully in the first place. Yeah. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Laughs] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Child laughing] [Speaking in Zulu] ♪♪ Now just an opportunity for the members of the media to ask questions. There was an attempt to destroy homes, but the police took the appropriate action, and there were none of those homes then destroyed. The crowd was dispersed by means of the necessary police action. [Rooster crows] I'm afraid I don't have any details on that. None has been brought to our attention. The police claim that they were unaware of any homes destroyed or people displaced, which... which is pretty ridiculous. Especially if they'd had 24-hour policing there. Then they would have noticed people leaving on Sunday. Who did the killing that night? I doubt the police are gonna help us uncover that. [Horn honking] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [People chanting in Zulu] [Applause] [Cheering] I mean, essentially what Nigel Gumede, who is the chairperson of the municipality's housing committee, said, was that Kennedy Road is not developed because of the Slums Act appeal, that if it hadn't been for the Slums Act appeal, that people would have houses by now, which, again, points to... ...basic lying. [Laughter] Hello. I'm here to drop my CV. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Knock, knock. Knock, knock. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Thank you. ♪♪ ♪♪ Thank you for that. That's probably one of the most exciting things that's happened to me. Okay. Section 16 made slum clearance possible without consultation, without all the safeguards that national legislation provides. From today, Section 16 of the act is deleted. It just doesn't exist. The Slums Act, you don't have to worry about it anymore. It's gone. I think it's an important judgment for Abahlali and for all shack dwellers in South Africa.
