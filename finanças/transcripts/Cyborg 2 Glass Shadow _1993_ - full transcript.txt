02 Cyborg 2 Glass Shadow - 1993 English Mmm! Ahh... Oh, yeah. They're beautiful. Ha ha! Ahh... Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Ahh... Mmm! [PANTING] Ha! Ahh... Oh, yeah. Caught a loop there. Go lateral and fix. [PANTING] Oh, yeah. We're level, right on time with 109er, and she's a go. All right. Heat her up. [PANTING] Ah! I'm burning. Oh! I'm burning! T.A.D. In 11 seconds and counting. 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1. Kick off. Holy shit! Man, what a waste. Fire alert. Observation 1. Send in the boys. Have them send up a shitload of window cleaner. Ha ha ha! Cyborg stew. Glycerine-3 acidosulphide-dioxogine... Glass shadow for short... Injected into the cyborg's circulatory system and directly linked to a microbeam detonator, virtually undetectable in human form, aggressively effective, the cutting edge of counter espionage technology in a humanoid robotics application. And while our major competitor, Kobayashi, has tried similar designs, only Pinwheel has been able to overcome the chemical rejection of a bio explosive implant. Dreena, the cyborg test unit you just saw was injected with a mere 20 milligrams of glass shadow. The Osaka operative will be carrying over 100,000. Has she been selected? Her name is Casella Reese. The trainers call her cash. Peak condition, top of the line, our very best. What has she got? A hypersophisticated psychoemotional program designed specifically for her, human in almost every respect... Love, hate, anxiety, anger, sexuality, and most importantly, fear. Every time she screws somebody, she'll explode? I wish my ex-wife had that problem. [LAUGHTER] The sexual demonstration was chosen as the most entertaining way of showing the board the infinite possibilities of the glass shadow. With Kobayashi corporation folding, Pinwheel will monopolize the biotech world. Two years from now, they'll say, "if God didn't make you, Pinwheel did." We'll own this planet. Casella Reese, you've got a great future behind you. Ah! Ha ha! You're dropping your left, cash. Ah! You think so, colt? Class dismissed. Where's dreena? Who? Dreena... my room mate. They took her away. What happened to her? How should I know? Ooh, can't take my eye off you. What's going on? Nothing that concerns you. What's she done? Nothing that concerns you. Come... come here. Look, ricks, don't start any shit with me. You're already on thin ice. Asshole. Mind your own business, or you'll never get out of here. You're going to be semi operative for a couple of hours. Nothing to worry about. Just try and relax. Interrupt Pinwheel feed. Enough synthetic homework for now. Time to get real. There's a few things you should know if you decide to go. Other cyborgs have tried it and failed. Only one made it all the way, but she had a protector, a human... A warrior... A hero. If you really want to make it, find yourself a hero. Do you know any heroes? No. Would you like a suggestion? Yes. Did they hurt you? Probably. You know the rules... No fraternizing with cyborgs. What's happening? Yeah... You. Just you and me, colt .45, mano a mano. This a joke? Ha ha ha! Guess not. Holy Christ. [SPEAKING LATIN] Who are you? I am the word of God almighty! Satisfied? No. No pleasing some. So what did she give you, huh? A billet d'amour? No. A matchbox. Ooh, the flame of love. Nobody told me about you. I keep a low profile. So who the hell are you? Your saving grace, Colton ricks. Take her to observation 4. Got to split before they trace me. Until then, I'll be seeing you in all the familiar places. Oh, Jesus. Reference again. Subject. Company regulations. Category. Um... Penalty for, uh... Fraternizing with a cyborg. Specify. Sexual contact. Immediate incarceration, plus fine, plus reprogramming charges, plus legal action in case of product damage. Minimum sentence... solitary confinement until death. Shall I go on? I'll get back to you on that. Purge conversation. Pleasant sleep? The usual. No dreams. Oh, sorry to hear that. But I do believe you have an assignation. A what? A rendezvous... Lab 9, 5:00 sharp. Shit. What the hell are you anyway? Hmm. A bad idea on the loose. Ha ha ha! Ah! Look at this. They're so beautiful. I wonder if they are real. There's more. Oh, Jesus. He's a cyborg. [SCREECHING] Monkey see, monkey do. Now, you get around, OK? What's your system? It's a secret, but let's just say that I can communicate with just about anyone anywhere within Pinwheel. I have a few of my own operatives topside, too. In other words, I can throw a monkey in anybody's wrench, right, cash? You've seen him before? He talks to me at night. [CLANG] What was that? The plot thickens. Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on you. Dreena? Ah! Guess what. What? They put the chill in me, cash. Why? They didn't discuss it with me. Are they going to fix you? They already did. Better kiss it good-bye, cash. You're next. Ha ha ha! Next for what? Glass shadow. Glass shadow? Mm-hmm. Liquid explosive, highly effective. It's circulating in your body at this moment, cash. Why? Why me? Corporate counter espionage unit. You were made to be destroyed. When? Osaka, two days from now. Dunn's arranged for you to attend a corporate meeting at the Kobayashi robotics plant, posing as an American investor. At a preprogrammed point, you will self-detonate, thus liquidating the company's entire chain of command. For what reason? In the ensuing crisis, stock value will plummet, leaving Kobayashi vulnerable to an immediate takeover by its chief rival. Pinwheel. Mmm, business as usual. Time to make hard choices. You have five seconds. Five seconds? 3, 2... 1. Bingo! You've just been reported stolen, cash, and guess who they claim the thief is. You, handsome. What do we do now? Run like hell. [ALARM] You know where we're going? A freight elevator on level 6. Hold your fire don't damage the cyborg Why don't they ever say, "don't damage the human"? Ugh! Unh! Unh! Argh! Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Come on! This way! This should be it. Yeah. Come on, come on. Aah! Jeez! [ELEVATOR SLOWING TO A STOP] Ugh! Oh, man. I got a bad feeling about this. Humans... always struggling with your feelings. Unfortunately, your feeling is right this time. Ah! Ah! Oh, shit. Not bad. Mine's not as sweet. That's funny. Bring up a schematic on this area, and let's get the hell out of here, OK. Through the bottom, under the floorboard, there's another hatch. Aah! Whoa! But watch out for the half-a-mile drop. Swing me! That-a girl! God, what a stench! I just shut my smell sensors off. Ah! Ah! Ah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha! OK, and what's next? We wait for our ride up. Your kidding me right we're going to hitch hike a ride on a trash container from hell? Lodjick tells us we have no other choice. I'll attach us. You just ride it out. Easy for you to say. Aah! You all right? I feel like I've been drug through a knothole. Get this thing off me. Let's go. I got to quit smoking. You know the city? I haven't been topside in a while. Eight years, I think. What are you doing? A little interface. Not bad for a first-time break. How do you do that? Black magic. I got to make you disappear. You better do it quick pal. Because I'm a felon now. OK Grand theft robot. I don't need to be busted for possession of an unlicensed cyborg, let me tell ya. What? Colt! What? What is it? What is it? I've been activate... I've been activated! Uh-oh. What? What's going on? I was afraid of this. Afraid of what? Now you better give me some answers hot lips come on. They wired a recall code to her tracking system. The detonator self-activates when she's far from the plant. They don't want anyone to find out she's carrying the glass shadow. Help me! Hey! Hey! It's OK. Stay calm, cash. The patterns in recall voice will probably switch off any second. Think straight. What does the clock read? 8 hours, 57, and 3. You got time. How much time? About nine hours. The signal is playing hockey with your feedback control. It's trying to disorient you so you can't escape. Come here. Come here. You're safe. You're safe. It's cool. I'm safe. Remember, you're throwing out a hell of a signal. You won't be clear of danger until you've been defused. OK What's the plan? Get some wheels. Hope I remember how to drive. She can if you can't. No problem. I'll drive. You'll drive? Yeah. Go to 1830 Perrot street. It's in the warehouse district downtown, and wait for wild card. If you miss him, head straight for the city museum in South sector. - OK - I'll find you. Alright Hey, hey, hey! Who the hell are you? Oh! Almost forgot. The name is... Mercy. Ready when you are, Chen! You screwed up, letting our princess out of her tower. What's our plan now Dunn? She's not the problem. It's the human... Colt. The best laid plans... Just shut up and listen. Get topside and intercept cash. Disconnect the Pinwheel detonator and install your own. Make sure it's undetectable. After you kill colt, we're back in business. What about Pinwheel? They'll definitely want her back. Don't worry about Pinwheel. When the time is right, I'll destroy cash, Pinwheel, and Kobayashi all at the same time. Ooo... Remind me to never piss you off. Who says you haven't already? Sending Pinwheel security to locate her is out of the question. Why? Our tracking system will alert hackers and tappers topside. And they'll tear her to pieces for the parts. That sort of garage sale must be avoided at all costs. She won't respond to the activation warning? After the 40-minute point, the odds decrease some 11% on the hour. Apparently whatever emotion drove her to escape may override her sense of self-preservation. She'd rather self-destruct than surrender? Check. The boys in program call it a freedom-cathexis aberration. Put simply... She's the first cyborg to escape by human reasoning, so it's escape or bust. Now, we're still speculating on the motives of the combat instructor. Corporate spying? Possibly. They appear to have had outside help. Could be Kobayashi. What's your plan, Dunn? This unit's training program was under your own personal supervision. If she's apprehended and analysed, the entire glass shadow project is dead. And Pinwheel bites the big one. Normal tracking patterns of escapee traffic will not apply in this scenario, not with a major corporate accomplice. No, my fellows, I suggest we enlist the man who has experience, somebody who knows the street, somebody who's worked with irrational prototype models like the Velma unit five years ago. Get a psycho to find a psycho. You're not suggesting... Yes. Yes. Master Daniel bench. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yes? Hello, bench. Well, well, well, well... Martin Dunn from Pinwheel. It's been a long time. How may I, uh... Assist you? Are you still active? Well, if that's your polite little way of inquiring if I still kill people for a living, the answer is oui, oui, si, si, oh, yes. I am still an equal opportunity Terminator. I thought you may have slowed down after the Velma incident. Temporary setback. You call five years temporary? Well... The face is nicely on the mend now. Trifle expensive, though, but we can afford it. An emergency has come up. We're in need of services. To the tune... Of? 350,000 for 9 hours, plus an additional 10% if the product is delivered intact. 30%. 20. Come on, Dunn. 25... surgical costs are absurd these days. Affirmative. We have a spec a, lc-7 female cyborg, standard anitronic espionage model, plus one human, male, 30 years. Employee? Instructor. Hand-to-hand, small arms. I don't know, Dunn. You sound kind of nervous to me. She wouldn't happen to be an experimental model, would she? That's classified. Do you want the job or not? Times being what they are... I thought so. The product has a 200-mile tap. We can vid-fax pictures and set up a relay right now. Proceed. I think it would be better if I go alone. The hackers will be looking for a couple not a single. If I'm not back in 30 minutes, meet me at the museum in south sector. OK. I'll wait across the street in that alley, OK.? Don't get dead. I'm looking for wild card. Just follow me. You wait here. [SPEAKING CHINESE] Yoo-hoo! Over here, killer. No doubt about it. That window will never mess with you again. Nervous reflex, man. I forgot you're... Strung pretty tight. Too many drugs. Probably. What's next? Hook up with cash and wait for your contact. OK How will I know him? He'll know you. Smart as a whip. And remember, somebody somewhere is dogging cash's beacon. In fact, you've probably got a wiretapper on your tail now. A wiretapper? Professional cyborg tracker... Keeps the escape classified. They're well-paid, and I never met one who wasn't a borderline psychopath. Ah! What are my chances? Hell, kid, I'm amazed you're still breathing. [SNORTS] You're a sweetie. [SPEAKING CHINESE] Where you learn speak Chinese? I was trained. Train for what? What you want to know? How much time do I have? You got friend? Yes. He's waiting for me. You got sharp field. Very strong charge. How you got such strong energy? You need money? Money? I got job for you. Good work for cyborg girl. Top dollar. Aahh! Ooh! Hey, buddy! Hey! Got a light? Very big gun. Makes very big holes. I get the point. Put these on. On your back! Fuck! Your pretty little mate, where is she, inside? She's gone, man. I didn't realize that you were so tired of living. Aah! Fuck! Don't... Don't kill me, man. What's the magic word? Please. Please, please, please, please, what? Please don't kill me. Oh, I do like a boy with manners. You beckon the doorman, and you keep your hole shut! Your girlfriend's very, very close, isn't she? You got me. Can I help you? Just conducting a little... Inquest here in your beautiful, beautiful kosh parlour. You're no cop. [SCREAMING] Colt? Colt, are you down there? Colt? Aahh! Ugh! Have a seat. I'll stand if you don't mind. Please! OK. Cuff yourself to that bar. Give it a nice little tug. [THUNDER] Cigarette? Yeah. Oh, so sorry. I don't have any. You're a spook, man. You know that? You need some serious fucking therapy. Oh, but it's so much fun to watch, isn't it? Mmm... I guess so. I have... Unusually sensitive skin. We must guard continually against infections. They do cause... Complications. I knew Pinwheel was cutting back on costs, but they must be desperate to bring you in. Where do you hail from, Mr. ricks? New Orleans. Have you ever been to the, uh... Oh! Magical far east? No, I haven't had the pleasure. You really should get out more, Mr. ricks. Travel really does broaden the mind. Now, are you going to tell me... Where she is? Hey, I told you. I have no idea where she is. Little boy Colton has lost his mate and doesn't fancy a look, but master bench... And his bloody henchman... Must hang his head on a hook. Ow! What is that? That's the third eye. They say that it does help you see far into the future. Oh, shit! No, no, no, no. Don't cover it up. It's liquid crystal based... Very, very sensitive to the light. Do you see? Otherwise, it will burn a furrow deep, deep, deep into your corpus callosum, and then you're going to be in a... In a desperate state. All this fun has just left me limp with excitement. I believe I'm going to join you in your peaceful slumber. You have pleasant dreams, Mr. ricks. I think we're coming around, yes? Hello. My name is tea. Would you like miss chen with your cream? Recode logical and pattern back. Entry, first subject. Wh... who is you greeting me? And I am? Miss chen. Who has offered you... Cream for my tea. And if you don't like cream? I'll take it black. Thank you. Well, doesn't appear to be any serious damage. Now, V.E.M. Replication, I want optical memory playback. You've been a naughty girl. It's in my program. It appears Pinwheel has planted a bomb in you. Yes. Can you remove it? I don't think it can be removed. Your entire system appears to be suffused with it. This is the detonator. It's still active. Not necessarily. There. The detonation clock in your field of vision will gradually run its course to zero and stop. On the other hand... No! Oh, yes. Make it stop. Well... What's it worth? Anything. Just make it stop. I know you have a partner. A cyborg. Tell me where he is, and I guarantee safe passage out of the country. All right. [WINGS FLAPPING] They say the happiest people have no memories. None. You've been contacted by a tapper. Just stay in the dark and don't reveal any landmarks. Geography always tips them off. OK. You all right? Yes. I just hope mercy contacts us soon. Yeah. Mercy. It's not what you expected, is it? What? The world. Topside. I thought it would be beautiful. Yeah. Well, it ceased to be beautiful a long time ago. People just screwed it up. How could they let it get so bad? Because people aren't programmed, cash. They're not schematics, and they're not circuitry. They're... They're flesh and blood. We learn by trial and error. OK., some errors are worse than others. Some of the trials, too. Now you're talking about cyborgs, man's puny attempt to play God. It's a fucked concept. I hated you all at Pinwheel, you know? When I started working there, the staff there acted like Dunn was Geppetto. By the end, all we'd created were perverted Pinocchios. Until they created you. When I first started... Having feelings... A genuine attraction to you, I was scared because they were playing God better than ever, and I was buying into it. Man, and I-i knew what kind of treachery Pinwheel was capable of, and I was more afraid for you... Than... than for myself. Any regrets? No. None. No. None. Except one. That... We won't live our lives together and die together. Today might be that day, punk. I'll be damned... If it isn't sweet raven chen! Long time no see, Danny. I heard a cyborg almost did you in. Oohh... Yes! She gave me a run for it, all right. Seems that, uh, our darling little Velma had a fondness for battery acid. Gave me a full-face splash. Beautiful bitch. The tapping game isn't what it used to be. Maybe it's time you checked out. Aah! Jesus Christ! Look what you've done! Wait, wait, cash. We don't have time for this. We got to keep moving. Ah, the nuclear family. An appropriate name. You were right. He's of very little use to me. Where are you? So, tell me what's worse... Cyborg envy... Or human envy? Penis envy? Huh? Ah! I like your style, gorgeous. [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] Hey, puppy, you lost? Who cares? How much time we got left? Wait a minute. He's synthetic. Mercy must have sent him. Man, great. Benji the cyborg. [MECHANICAL BARK] Let's follow the dog. [CHILD LAUGHING] [SCREAMING] This must be it. Oh, yeah. Sounds like a wonderful place. Yes. May I help you? Yes you can let us in. Do you have a reservation? [BARK BARK] Mercy sent us. I'll have to check with the manager, excuse me a moment Welcome to Towndown. Your entrance has been approved. [GRINDING] Oh, yeah. Uh! Thanks. We're looking for mercy. Nobody finds mercy. Mercy will find you. Towndown's a shipyard? More like a graveyard. This is pre-war shit, all obsolete. When enough fools and freaks move in, they call it a town. You only need one thing to live here... What's that? Basic human survival instinct. [SHIP HORN SOUNDS] The man says to approach. He can see us? In these parts, if you can't see it coming, it's probably too late. I wish you luck. [BELL RINGING] Cover it up, boys. So, where to, Benji? What's next? [TICKING] [TICKING GETTING LOUDER] You're late. Ran into some shit. It's getting thicker. What do you mean? The ship I paid my last dollar for just burned to the ground. Someone doesn't want you to leave. What other options do we have? Only one... rent another boat. Great. How are we supposed to do that? Ever hear of the blade? No. Snuff combat under a stern propeller of a dry-dock ship. Big attraction here. Two enter, one comes out. Fast, brutal, and highly illegal, and you're a contender. Forget it. I'm not going through a blender so you can place some bets. Easy, colt .45. Remember, the difference between champ and chump... Is you. The blade's your ticket to the Mombasa shuffle. A ticket to where? Mombasa... the only free zone on earth for unlicensed cyborgs. The purse will rent you a black-market boat for the trip, and it leaves tonight... With you... Or without you. Hey, Marty, my love! Four hours and counting, bench. Where are you? I'm due west, riding right by magical Harbor view. Towndown? Not unlike our late, lovely Velma. The Harbor zone has a well-developed criminal network. However, the similarity is circumstantial at best. Well, silly, silly me. I just have trouble believing that, so you listen to me. I'm going to outline our new terms of agreement. Total termination for a 50% increase in fee! Out of the question. The woman is too valuable, and the man is a matter of internal security. I just bet he is, but, Marty, you're missing the point because retrieval is no longer an acceptable option. Are you threatening me, bench? Ah, threaten. What a quaint, quaint, quaint word. I've been mutilated! Five painful years I've done my therapy, and I'm butchered by a little shit-kicker and his little piece of wind-up muff! You're off the case, bench. You touch them, we'll have your license. Oh, I love it. What license? I love it. I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] So, why do they call you wild card? It's a long story, and you're not going to be awake for it. You've got a thing happening, huh? Yeah. Cyborg love. Just like Romeo and Juliet. Got to cross all those lines to connect. Kind of a doomed thing, huh? Doomed? Yeah. Like it cannot last, even if this love is true. Only one way it can live on. How? Someone's got to cross over and live the time of their beloved. Time... Is what it's all about. Cash will live for a thousand years, forever 22, as long as they keep making parts to maintain you, but colt .45... He'll peel like yesterday's paint, being just a bit of blood and bone. He's a memory as we speak. If you can cross over just a little, just enough to taste each other's time, well, then your time together just might be enough. Would you want to live forever? Mortal... Or immortal... Here I die. I leave eternity to thee. For what is a man that he should live out the lifetime of his God? Who is mercy? He used to command a fleet. What happened? It's not a pretty story. He was wounded in battle of Elanor Yuff. The Navy just couldn't scrap a human hero, so they rebuilt him with cyborg parts. He's cyborg? Experimental model. Went renegade. Saw the world as a hired soldier. Ran guns in Gaza, Kabul. Led a coup in Mozambique. The gent's a poet/warrior in the classic sense. [MERCY] My wife... Velma. Where is she? She's dead. Sorry. It was sort of an arranged marriage, a pairing of man... And machine. Velma was a free spirit, a searcher for a better world. She spent most of her time helping renegade cyborgs escape from Pinwheel's hell, but they finally got her. Your tapper... bench... killed her but not before she messed him up. Is that why you're helping cash and me? Mm-hmm. Marriage is a magical thing. Ha! A treacherous thing. Pull out that centre drawer. Open it. Some things are customary before a man goes into battle. [WHIRRING] [KNOCK KNOCK] It's time to rumble. [ALARM] I've spoken to the fight promoter... Bobby Lin. He's expecting you. This... Is the dragon. Here's pier 77. After the fight, you'll have 20 minutes Too make it to die Frau Maria. Who do we meet? The captain's name is Choy Fook. He'll recognize you. If he doesn't, get out... Fast. That's it. Huh. Well, win or lose, it's been a trip. You're a kick-ass wire, mercy. We're looking for Bobby Lin. Mercy sent us. Bobby Lin? Who want to know? Mercy. Mercy... Says good things about you... Fast, lots of style. This guy I'm fighting, what's his record like? He first-time fighter, too. Newcomers always kick the odds up, make lots more money. That's good. Everything's set. This next match... Goes all the way. Round one, no blades. Round two, one blade. Round three and final round, both blades. Only person allowed is trainer. That you, right? Bell will start fight. Give us a good show, eh? What's our time situation? 2 minutes to the bell, 44 for the ship. Shit... mercy. We got to call, make sure things are set with the boat guy, OK.? Be careful, colt. Right. So go. For love. Hey, what else is there? Go. Go. Go. [BELL RINGS] Ya! Come on! Go! Go! Yeah! Yeah! [BELL RINGS] [BELL RINGS] Come on, let's go! Get him! [BELL RINGS] [BELL RINGS] Oh, no. If you interfere, colt disqualifies! No Mombasa! Down! Down! Down! [METAL CLANKING] Kill him, colt! Aah! [SLICE] Aah! Aah! Aah! All right, break up this party, sergeant. Yes, sir. Colt, Pinwheel! Ah! Let's go! No, don't, cash! They'll blow you away, baby. No t hey won't. I cost too much. But your boyfriend is dirt-cheap. Give it up, cyborg, or he's a dead man. Way to stand by your man, cash. I like that. And, colt, that was one hell of a fight. And to you Pinwheel pinheads... I only have one thing to say... Incoming. God damn it! All right, break off and fan out! I want these people found. [WHIRRING] Mercy. So much for myths. If you want to dine with the devil, you'll need a long spoon. Mercy. We can do better. Oh. Mercy. Glad you could make it. You know, you've always been such a, uh, a formidable opponent. [SNAP] Until your untimely capture, that is. And I thought I'd at least let you come and watch me play my final card. [WHIRRING] You see, this is Chen's detonator. It has a 2,000-mile range. So, alas, it appears that the honeymoon's over for cash and colt. What? No... no quick, smart-ass remark? No retort from the man with the video mouth? Cash and colt, you can kiss your asses good-bye. Warning, a detonation sequence has been detected within the complex. Initiate emergency evacuation sequence. I think you kissed the wrong ass good-bye. 2, 1, 0. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MERCY] Time is what it's all about. Cash crossed over and lived the time of her beloved colt, proving once again that love is stronger than flesh...
