Why aren't you in class? [Laughter] Oh... See... You don't know this because... You're a substitute, but we don't have class today. It's been dismissed. [Laughter] Who's your teacher? Why aren't you gentlemen in class today? Who is this bum? Our class has been dismissed. Do you need me to spell it out for you? D-e-s... Something. Here, read this instead. Now you're dismissed. Fuck you very much. The enemy is before me, around me, and yet no fear will I have. My mission is met. Death is my mission. My mission is met. Hee hee hee hee! Come on, get him.Take him. Play? Let's do it. That... Looks good now. Yeah. Make him feel welcome. This is your last warning. Now, will you please get to class? They were just on their way to class. Isn't that right, gentlemen? Yeah, right. [Beep] [Ash] D.e.d. Lock phrase. Forrest-slash- megatex-slash-ash. This is Gordon d. Ash, special investigator for the department of educational defense. After two years of intense searching, I'm certain I've finally located him. As is known, this situation began with professor Bob forrest and his plan to turn military battle androids into special teachers that would go into the worst schools to teach and enforce discipline when necessary. Unknown at the time was that forrest programmed these droids with his own twisted sense of discipline, turning them into cold--or whatever-- blooded killers. The droids focused on the schoolchildren as the enemy, not as students. [Sawing] It was assumed that all droids were destroyed, along with their brilliant but demented creator. [Radio playing] Hey, what are we waiting for, man? For that substitute fuck! So we can give him something to remember US by. Now, school board policy is that you back away from confrontation, Bolen. Damn it! You don't beat the hell out of the students. First, there was that incident with ray Buchanan, then this. Discipline is necessary to maintain order. Order is necessary to prevent anarchy. O.k., find some reality to hold onto here, Bolen. Look, if President Clinton hadn't been indicted and his education programs had gone through, well... I'm going to have to suspend you. Now, for some reason, your file is incomplete, so I'm going to need more information on you. [Choking] [Crack] [Radio playing] [Clanking] Shh. Hear that? You're being unfair to him. [Grunting] Fake it. What's up, skeeto, man? Hee hee. I wonder if Mr. Terminator is bulletproof. Ha ha.Ha ha. Do it. Aah!aah! Now class is dismissed, gentlemen. [Beep] [Beep beep] [Beep] Evidence indicates a unit may have been left behind in an underground bunker... And roaming free, it continues to kill. There are no photos of this unit, therefore the situation has been slow to resolve. But these latest leads are very promising indeed. [Beep] [Buzzer] Attention. Last school lock-down is in five minutes. Any student found wandering in the hallways will be detained for arrest. Repeat--last school lock-down in five minutes. Thank you. Have a nice day. [Thump] Ohh! That cat... Scratched me once. How you doing, miss mckensie? What are you doing here, Sanders? You're suspended. You're not allowed on school grounds. Got to keep up with my homework. Speaking of which, how about coming over and...Tutoring me sometime? You look awful good in those gray, tight little jogging pants you had on this morning. Mmm. I'm not afraid of you, Sanders. No? No. I'll put your foot up your ass to go with him, homes. Banging in parking lots ain't my style, grazer. Style? You? I don't think so. What biting, satiric wit. Yeah, that's what I thought. Fuck you. [Buzzer] What a biting, satiric comeback. Mmm. What the hell's the matter with you? The smell of testosterone in the morning. Yum. What was I supposed to do, stand there and let him molest you? Sanders isn't going to hurt me, Emmett. He isn't that stupid. I don't know. That's a strange dude. Well, come on. [Students chattering] Where is Mr. Reese? Sit down, please. I said take your seats and quiet down until your teacher arrives. Get in your seats. Now. My name is John Bolen. I'm a substitute teacher for Mr. Reese. We're all fuckin' thrilled. I didn't say anything. Who are you? Last name first. Uh...uh... Dennis tiller--no... Tiller, Dennis... I think. Now, I don't know what you may have done previous to this. But while you're in my class, the young men will act like gentlemen, and the young ladies-- will blow US later. I also expect homework to be done neatly, properly, and turned in on time. [Missiles] [Explosion] Who did that? [Beeping] All right, it's my book, but I didn't do it. Mr. Tiller, please report yourself to the principal's office now. Open your accounting books and read the chapter on the collapse of Japanese control over the computer... [Telephone rings] All the details for this weekend taken care of? Yes. Didn't Emmett tell you? I just wanted to check on your end of it, Jenna. It's just--well... Honey... Mr. Baldwin felt that maybe... Come on, boys. Spit it out. I have a class to teach. Did you see what happened to the gym last night? Broken windows, spray painting. And your name was on everything-- and not in a complimentary way. Oh. So, uh...I'm to blame for vandalism now. I want you to seriously reconsider testifying Monday against Sanders. It's hurting your effectiveness as a teacher. The students feel that you're persecuting Sanders for what everyone but you says is an accident. Sanders reaches into his backpack, pretends to accidentally discharge a gun into another student's stomach, and you want me to just forget about it? You're the only one who's saying that it wasn't an accident. I am the only one who saw him aiming that gun inside the backpack. I... I can't believe you can't see how manipulative Sanders is. This thing could blow up right in our faces because of you. The police aren't even holding on to the boy for his arraignment. They're convinced that this whole thing was a tragic accident. This is crazy. I don't have to justify myself to you or anybody else. I saw what I saw. A little common sense and cooperation can go a long way, especially when you come up for review soon. Gee... Thanks for your support. I'll see you later... Honey. [Siren] [Sniff sniff] Ohh. [Playing air guitar] Aah! You like tormenting people? Uhh! You hit me in the face, you son of a bitch! Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to do this. Sadistic behavior should not be condoned, especially when you're not trained to do it properly. O.k., I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please! I didn't mean to do it! [Groaning] Help me! Aah! Aah! Aah! I sent the student to the principal's office. I have no idea why he went to the roof or what he was doing up there. O.k. Thanks. I'll get back to you if I have any questions, but it seems like some sort of weird accident. I found what I thought was ethyl digimesitol. Edge. Had some in his pocket. Probably high as a kite. Dumb way to die. [Students laughing] But, of course, I guess there's no smart way, is there? Nice to meet you. Were you special forces? No. There's a junior RotC group here in case you're... Interested... Or not, if that's the case. O.k. If I join you? If I ate like that, I'd be... I convert food to fuel very rapidly. It's almost nuclear. I, um... I wanted to explain about this morning in the classroom. You've probably heard about this trial by now. Maybe everybody's right about me not testifying. No, they're not. If you allow a student to gain control of a situation, the result is anarchy. Anyone who's telling you not to testify is wrong. Just like that? Just like that. You're in charge of chaperons at the RotC paintball skirmish this weekend? Yeah. My friend Emmett grazer owns the grounds. It was his idea. Well, I'd like to offer my help if I can, as long as I'm here. Great! Sure. You'd be more than welcome. Do you have some sort of military experience? Some. So, um... Are you from around here? No. Teach in the area before? No. Well... O.k. Um, come see me later for a chaperon info sheet. If I'm correct in my assumptions, the normal mode of operation for this particular battle droid will be to cap off a series of onesy-twosy murders with a mass kill, then move on to his next teaching assignment. Come on, Jenna, don't be mad. Baldwin ambushed me when I went in there to talk about this weekend. Did he threaten you with detention if you didn't side up with him and gang up on me? You'll either support my decision or not. What's it going to be? I said I would. You said... But you're not acting like it. It's hard enough without having to fight you, too. I know that! Someone just reminded me that this is the right thing to do, so I want to know, one way or another, where you stand. You're right. I should've told him to go shove it. Wouldn't have been the first time. He probably would have tried to give you permanent detention, like when we were in school. I don't know why you like me, Jenna. You're a teacher. I barely graduated. You read the classics. I'm strictly simpsonsreruns. But I couldn't care about anybody more. You know that, don't you? I like you because you have a good heart... And because you're not afraid to admit when you're wrong. That's a very sexy quality. Plus you got the nicest buns this side of Sacramento, cowboy. [Beep] This is consistent with its original battle programming, which was to infiltrate the enemy camp, test the security response, and then eliminate as many of the enemy as possible. This is a very unstable unit. Stopping it might be extremely dangerous, especially if it's locked into some endless loop kill-command sequence, which I believe is the case. G.d. Ash out. Yo! Ooh, foxy mama! Hoo-hoo! Sanders and I thought you and I should get to know each other better. Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh! I'd like to help-- ha ha! But these gangster boys won't let me. Help! Help! Miss Jenna's in danger from a maniac! Help! Let me go, you bad, bad gangbanger boys! Oh, no. He's gonna hurt her. Uh! Help! Help. You haven't seen nothin' last week, miss mckensie. That was a mistake. It was an accident, right? Right? You haven't seen nothin' last week, mckensie. You need to take me a little more serious when I tell you something, miss mckensie. Aah! See, I won't let you put me into jail. Remember that. [Jenna screams] No! Aah! No! No! Aah! Aah! I just don't have the manpower to assign someone to you permanently. I know. I'll... I'll be fine. Just don't get yourself hurt. These boys are mean. Instead of excuses, why aren't you doing something to help her? You don't know anything about this. There are extenuating circumstances. The only circumstance you should be concerned with is the fact that she's doing her civic duty and you're doing nothing to support or help her. Now you wait just one minute! Could you, um, take me home, please? You will be going to school this morning? I--i don't think so. You have to go. Otherwise, the others will know that Sanders has won. You'll never get respect from any of them again. Look, don't... Don't patronize me. I'm not one of your students. Aren't you a little young to be a teacher anyway? Aren't you? That's an interesting-looking book. Do you mind? Poems of war. A--a little light reading? It's a good book. I didn't mean to make light of it. Can I borrow it? I promise I'll give it back. Yeah. The poems help center me. My favorite is the mission. [Emmett humming] How's it going, Emmett? Hey-o, Tom. Be right with you. [Beep-beep beep-beep] Ha! [Beep-beep beep-beep] [Beep-beep beep-beep] Paintball encounters. Uh, no. We're closed this weekend for a private party. Yeah. Try again next week. O.k., thanks. What the heck is this stuff anyway? Kelvan k-33 body armor... Used by army special forces. Breathable kelvan. Less than 10 pounds, waterproof, flame-retardant, turn back anything less than a .45-caliber round. Also knifeproof unless the knife has an ice pick tip and is inserted between the superdense composite fibers. It's traäs fashionable, no? I'm here to see the museum. Not open. Sorry. This is the special forces guy I told you about. You owe him. He helped Jenna out of a tight spot. Jenna? What are you talking about? When she got attacked this morning. She didn't call you about it? She's fine, Emmett. Look, Emmett... Why the hell didn't someone call me? Why didn't you call me? [Arguing] I've got to inspect that bunker before this weekend, or I can't allow those kids to come. Tomorrow, Tom. I promise. [Crash] It was an accident. Oh, whatever. Look, man, we got to clear out of here, so, uh... I'm so sorry to hear about what happened to you. Yeah. I don't know. It's getting kind of crazy around here. Well, take care of yourself. All right. Bye. [Car engine starts] Damn. Jenna. Jenna. Jenna. I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! Honey, you all right? Who did this? I don't know. Oh, god damn it, Jenna! What? What? What are you so mad about? Why didn't you tell me about this? What would you have done? I feel like this complete idiot. Everybody knows except me. What bothers you more, Emmett, that I was attacked or that you weren't told? I swear to god, I don't know anything anymore. What were you doing out here by yourself? Gee, that's a tough one. I guess it's that I don't get nearly enough excitement in my life. Oh, I get it. We're doing the sarcastic thing, huh? Yeah. Yeah. It's all my fault. I should have told Sanders not to kill that student in cold blood so you wouldn't have to be so put out! Maybe you should reconsider testifying. I mean, no one but you is saying... Go ahead, say it. Go ahead, Emmett. Say it! Just take me home. I got to stop at the trailer and pick up my overnight stuff. I, um... I don't think I want you to stay tonight, o.K.? Why don't you just drop me off at the sheriff's office so I can file a report? Hey, fine. Whatever you want. Let's do this your way, Jenna. Ha ha! Oh, Jenna! Ice... Hello. Heh heh heh heh heh heh! Do you like tormenting people? Suck it. Suck it in, you punk. Yeah... Heh heh heh! It's no fun to be afraid, to be tormented, is it? Oh...no. Go ahead. Now's your chance, ice. Run. Ice... Ice... Run. Run. Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Ice. Come on! [Gas hisses] You've been more than a bit of a discipline problem. Now we're going to have to do something about your attitude. Aah! Uhh! Come on, man! Uhh! Aah! Aah! Let me go! In fact, you're on permanent detention. [Hiss] No...no...aah... No! No! Aah! Aah! Aah! School's out. Please? I really need some time by myself right now. Damn it, Emmett, just leave it alone. I can't be with you right now. I'll be right back. What is this about? Shouldn't you have told Baldwin about this? Nah. We get those all the time through the state net. I usually trash 'em. As if anything as interesting as a serial killer would ever happen in this town. Well, you know what I mean. No, uh, I'm afraid I don't. I don't think "interesting" is the word I'd use to describe a serial murderer. Who asked you? Don't touch my garbage. This is official trash. Not for civilian eyes. "I will strike a path in death's shoes "until the mission I conclude. "Until the mission I conclude. "No sorrows or regret. "Death is my mission. "My mission... Is met." "The enemy is before me, "around me and yet... No fear will I have." Pass it up, man. Whoo! Hey! What's up, man? Hey, what's happening? All right, you little shit, no more fucking around. You listen to me. You come near Jenna, you're going to wind up dead. Got it? Good. Hey, Emmett, you ready to go? Hey-o, Tom, I'll be right with you. [Bang] Tom, Tom, don't use the gun. It's got the gasoline balls I made up as an experiment. I just wanted to clear them out before the kids got here. Let's go to the bunker. Emmett, will you slow down? You're killing me. This stuff's heavy. Thank you. How far are we from the trailers, about half a mile? Yeah. I don't know. It seems close. The kids might find it. No, they won't. [Tapping] A concrete bunker and a wooden door? I got a metal one coming from Sacramento. So, Emmett, what'd you do last night? Watch TV, huh? All right, I gave Sanders a little hell. Do your goddamn job right... What do you want me to do? Can't arrest Sanders for anything. He hasn't done anything, really. A lot of stuff. Yeah. Buying military stuff for the museum sure does accumulate. How many of these armor suits you got? I could use one. I wouldn't mind being bulletproof. Extra small. Surplus. Barely fit the mannequin at the museum. Wouldn't even fit you close. Hey, what's this? Tom, don't touch that. This is a suicide detonator. Once it's armed, it's armed. You mean you can't turn it off? That's right. Oops. Right, oops. All right, how's it look? Everything look secure? Yeah. O.k., let's go. Come on, let's go! Hi. How are you today? I wanted to tell you I'm really enjoying that book you gave me. You seem surprised. To tell you the truth, I am. I wanted to ask you about something. It's about the dedication. I bought it at a used book store. Hey, wait up! Do you know ray Buchanan from another school? No. Let's go get Emmett. Mike, get on the horn. Get forensics down here right away. Let me have that license plate scanner. Damn, Emmett, you should have stuck to shooting at fires. I didn't hear you come in. I was really... Lost in space. I just heard they arrested Emmett for the murder of the boy who attacked me last night. To tell the truth, the thing that has me most worried is... That I think Emmett is totally capable of killing that boy. It's a pretty scary thought. I don't know what to do. I'm not sure I understand you. Never mind. I have to go to the jail. Will you come with me? He didn't suffer any. Doc said his neck broke, didn't feel a thing. I want to see Emmett. No chance. Why not? What do you suppose he's in here for? Because of me? It's my fault? If he killed that boy, he didn't kill him for anybody else. You said it was an accident. We're not talking about him. Ray just fell off his bike, Mrs. Buchanan. Ray Buchanan is dead? [Knock knock] The man you arrested for the murder of the kid... What about him? How long have you known him? Who are you? You should've got a bulletin yesterday. Suddenly you got a lot of dead kids. Only one of them's a homicide. Is the man you arrested a teacher? No. What are you so interest-- hey, wait just one minute. Hey, pal! Ash! G.d. Ash. Hey! What's going on? Had to be sure. What are you talking about? That's classified, sheriff, but, uh, thank you for your cooperation. I'm not going to forget about this, Tom. I know you're pissed, Emmett, but I just couldn't take a chance on this. I'm really sorry. By the way, Jenna's here. I'll send her back if you can keep civil for five minutes. Ahem. Emmett. I'm letting you out. Jeff Patterson down at the Daisy Mae verified you were there all night. I said he would. Oh, it's getting late. Hold up. I'll give you a ride. Come on, Emmett. Emmett! Wait! [Telephone rings] [Ring] Sheriff's office. Yost speaking. Yeah. Hi, honey. They're doing what? Well, stop peeping out the window at them. I got to go. I got to catch up with Emmett. I didn't say that. I didn't say that Emmett's more important than you. Whoo whoo whoo whoo! Yeah! Hey, pretty boy! What's up, punk? Party at miss mckensie's! Jenna! Jenna! Where'd you disappear to? Never mind. I'm glad you're here. I came to get my book. I almost hate to give it up. Things have been so...Strange and confused lately-- Emmett being accused of being a serial killer. I mean, they might as well have accused you or me. After all, we're both teachers. We both knew the students who died. You even knew ray from another school, right? I told you before I didn't know him. May I please have my book? These poems are inspirational. Thank you for letting me read it. I feel better about what i'm going to do now. Maybe you understand the book because you're committed to doing the right thing-- to duty. I don't know. I'm not even sure that I want to be a teacher anymore, but, uh... I don't know. Let's not talk about it, o.K.? Doing your duty is never easy. Nobody understands that more than I do. Last and final warning-- don't testify, bitch. Fuck me. Jenna! Sheriff, this is Hazel. There's been a report of shots fired at Jenna's house. You better get over there right away. Jenna! John! [Siren] Jenna? Emmett. Jenna. You all right? Was it Sanders? Was it Sanders? Leave her alone for a goddamn minute. I don't know who it was. I never saw him before. This mean you're not going to press charges? I don't want to press charges. I don't want to testify about anything, and I don't want to answer anybody's questions about anything. I am out of the civic duty business for good. Fuck it! We hit her tomorrow at this RotC thing. I want everybody here tonight. I know exactly what we got to do... And how we got to do it. Ow. You o.K.? Yeah. Sorry. It's o.K. [Moaning] [Moaning echoes] [Heavy breathing echoing] Damn it, Sanders! I'm sorry. This is all my fault. This is no one's fault except Sanders'. The kids are starting to arrive. Where are the cops? Do they get special training to never be where you need them? [Jenna] Relax. They'll get here. This guy Bolen shows up, kids start dying, and after a drive-by shooting, he just disappears. Maybe he was even in on it with Sanders. Ever think of that? Why would he push me inside the house if he wanted me dead? I don't know. He just disappeared. Looks kind of funny, that's all. All right. It's all over. Let's take them. We got to go over the plan of attack. All right! Enough! That's it! We've shot at all the tin pans we're going to today. Who's in the mood for some good, clean fun? Aw, forget you. No way. How about we get down and dirty instead? Your ass is mine! This is war! O.k. O.K. This has to look like an accident, or I'm the first one they'll look for. She's pink, so you green guys attack her group with the paint guns. You pink guys hang back and don't get involved until Juan comes in and tells her that one of the players is injured. Then you pink guys make sure she ends up back here, where we can do her quietly. All right! All right! This is a referee. Anyone wearing orange is a referee. You shoot him, you're automatically disqualified. Understand? Yes, sir! When the siren sounds, the game is over. Don't make US come looking for you. All right? All right! Use your brains. If someone tumbles to what's going on... Cut their throat. No guns. We're the ones with armbands below the elbow. Once we have these masks on, you won't be able to tell who's who. Green team, form at the hell fort. Go! Go! And the pink team... Watch your asses. Let's do this. Pretty good, coach. Maybe you ought to teach the cheerleaders instead of me. I don't think so. My pompons would freeze in those short dresses. Sheriff, come in. Where the heck are you? This is the sheriff. Back. Emmett called again. That plate you had me run-- the fed? Forget about it. He's history. Car comes back as stolen. That federal man was thrown out on his butt for a violent insubordination and mental instability two months ago. [Beep] I lost track of the battle droid last night, and it never came back to the boardinghouse, but the principal of the school says it's supposed to chaperon a group of kids this morning. Based on its behavior and previous m.O., this is a perfect opportunity for a mass kill. I'm at the location now. God help me. [Shouting] [Paint gun shots] [Buzz buzz] [Buzzing every second] I hope you recognize the make of this gun... 'Cause it's loaded with armor-piercing smart rounds, and not even you can survive a point-blank hit. Put your weapon down. I'm not your enemy. I just don't want you to kill me before I have a chance to talk to you. The next time I ask, it'll be with this gun. Now put the goddamn weapon down. What have you got going down there? Classic. High-ground fortification, limited access, maximum visibility. I bet you got this whole area booby-trapped. What? Oh. Uh! Oh. Uh! You see, when I found out that you existed, I would have done anything to find you. Together we are going to create an army of battle droids that I'm going to lead into mercenary history. You don't want to decommission me? The only remaining battle droid of the a-77 series? Absolutely not. I'm going to copy you. I have a mission to complete first. Yeah. Whatever. [Chuckles] Forrest was a genius. He even gave you a tattoo. Ha ha ha. Uhh! [Gasping] Whoa! Ohh! [Paint gun shot] [Shouting] Uh. Mmm. You jerk. Oldest trick in the book. I outflanked you, Jenna. Yeah? Yeah. I'm going to outflank you, buddy. Whoa. Ho, ho. Just wait a minute. Official business, really. How long before I blow the whistle on this thing? I don't know. Maybe an hour or two. How'd you know it was me? Check your butt. I always Mark my territory. [Fires paint gun] I always Mark my territory, too. Stand guard till we get back. [Shouting] Aah! Aah-- [paint gun shots] Miss mckensie. Miss mckensie, quick. Over here. What? Andy's been hurt. Come on. Where? Yes! Yes! Thank you, thank you! We win. [Paint gun shot] Oh! [Whistle blows] Sorry about that. We didn't know you were the ref. You're supposed to stop firing when you score a hit. You never fire at a referee. Bring your weapons over here. You're all disqualified. Your teams will be penalized. Who does-- aah! What's going on, man? Come on, bud. Help US out, man. After all, rules are rules. He's messed up, man. Hey, hey, hey! You can't do this. No! No! No! No! Emmett! Jenna! What the hell-- Where is he? Right up here. Come on. This way. Up there. Where? Right up here. Emmett. Stay there. What is it? Old Navy s.E.A.L.S trick. Double-blind tripwires and traps. If the first one doesn't get you, the second one will. What the hell is going on out here? Right up here. Come on. This way. Right there. Go on. Oh! Oh! Oh! Kill the bitch. Aah! Let's just do this. Put your hands in the air! Drop your goddamn guns! 1, 2, die, scumbag. [Paint gun shots] I got them all, miss mckensie. Run! Get out of here! Run! Shut up. Come on. Do it, man. [Gunshots] What's happening out here? Sounds like a war. Who was that? Who's there? Who is it? Jenna? [Echoes] Give me your gun. All right, man. Go round up the other kids, o.K.? So much for making it look like an accident. Now we kill her and Bury them both. [Gunshots] Aah! Oh! Uhh! [Gunshots] Emmett! Jenna! Emmett! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Stay here. All right, you-- or what's left of you-- you're under arrest. Aah! Aah! Aah! [Bones breaking] Aah! Jenna? Miss mckensie. How you doing? Well, go ahead. Pull the trigger. That'll solve your problem. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha! You go to hell, Sanders. You first. [Gunshot] You first. Oh. Come on. Let's get out of here. No! Aah! Aah! Aah! I am an a-77 battle droid. My primary objective is to infiltrate and kill the enemy. Why can't I eliminate you, huh? 'Cause you're not a battle droid, you sick shit. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. "To my son John, "on the Eve of his enlistment into the service. Duty and discipline." No prisoners. It's from your father, professor... Professor forrest! You're his kid that went mental. I am a battle droid. Get a fucking clue. Battle droids are kind of scratchproof, Johnny. Human beings are soft. They can't take their punishment. They don't make good soldiers. You're right. They bleed too much. Ha ha ha ha. You're not a droid, John. You're just a kid wearing k-33 body armor. Well... End of mission, Johnny. So you're wearing kelvans too, huh? Damn. Uhh! G.d. Ash... Out. Aah! Aah! I have failed my mission. I must die. Would your father be proud of that attitude, John? We've both failed. We'll die together. No. You're right. You're right. You're right. I have failed.

Tomorrow will be a long day with this remedial class I'm teaching. And then my karate lessons. Oh, don't be silly. I'll be fine with this new class. They're just school kids. A little worse than most, but kids, really. After what I've just been through, nothing could faze me anymore. I'm on a mission... So to speak.
