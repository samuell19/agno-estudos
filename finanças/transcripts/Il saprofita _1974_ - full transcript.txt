Kill him, wears well! Stop it, you need more than any other faith. You could at least wait the Holy Blessing. I do not quite understand this quickly, and this resentment, then. You have to understand. Ultimately you got on well with us. The Church also needs simple brothers, all of them can be useful. You can serve God in many ways. confess, say mass, is not the most important thing. The priests, the representatives of God can not have physical defects ... ... you know, you have studied. You then, my son, you this difficulty to express yourself ... However, this is a letter of presentation for the Baroness Bezzi. She is a very pious woman, suffers so much because of a sick child and her husband. will find something for you to do. If heal and come back again, we will always welcome you with open arms. - Ah ... - It is the least I could do. "Now go with God." Please, have a seat. You get up, get up. Stand up. "Move your ass" from the chair. Next. Sit down here. Sit down here that you're comfortable. What do you do? Sacrilegious, ignorant, ignoramus, you do not have any money. Wait, huh? Wait I'll be back. Hurry we have people who are full of money. Come here and I'll attack the beard. But for the function the wine will not be with the powder, right? That of the peasant shit that gave me diarrhea. - No, this is good. Shut up. - You plan, you plan. Beautiful, baby, baby. He was right to take the child. He is just like Jesus Christ. Talk to the Holy Spirit. And then comes from the North. Look, blessed, six the same! For Madonna, you're the same! If I had a beard, I'd be the same. Beautiful, baby, baby. Brothers, indeed, indeed, I say to you today, my heart rejoices. - The Holy Spirit spoke to me. - The spoke, spoke to him. And now repeat the gesture of grace! Amen. - It's the body of God that it is difficult to digest. - Do not be silly. Indeed, indeed, I say unto you, here are the consequences of sin ... Convictions ... for our vices, the love of money, pleasures! Get it up! Come on, leave him alone. "Leave it," I said! Not God always hears us, the devil lurking acts as a filter. The evil is strong, perhaps will be fine next time. We must persevere! Indeed, indeed, I say! Mister! Mister! Has forgotten the offer. Oh, oh, that misery, but misery. Son, you're back. Poor us, that misery, but misery. How beautiful you are so. If I had known you were coming I would not have sent your sisters by Don Vito. At least he feeds him. Do you remember your brothers? Luckily the death helped, otherwise would be other "two mouths". However, tomorrow go by Don Vito to look for a job. It was he who sent the seminary, will help even the Christian saint. Then you are always one of them, at the bottom, right? "Ba-ro-nessa Bezzi". Good family, rich. court sentence the victim to the guillotine Indictment: pain in the ass in against the Baron Parsifal Bezzi ... ... son of Donna Clotilde of General Augusto Bezzi ... ... and brother of Brynhild ... ... known as the bearer of stupidity. ugly idiot who you are! break your head so you'll stop to Robespierre with flies ... ... and to break boxes to people. - Mom, I can not stand it anymore! - Patience, Brunilde. you, Parsifal, do not use a similar phrase with your sister. How many times must I tell to knock? Who is the Lord? Okay, 'Give me the letter. you come, come. "So I commend the bearer of confident that this will help him." "First of all, thank you for that made for the Institute. His, Don Pio." Don Pio wrote to me all, understand why he left the Institute. Sir, child, emotion has been prevented in the word, right? So in this house the less said the better. may be a friend to Parsifal can take it out in the car ... ... in short, a sort knight company. salary we will agree. He's got even need of clothes? Yes, I think I have something. Come . Come in, come. I think it should go well. My husband has the own size. Or at least almost your same size. Can I call you, right? My husband does not sleep anymore with me for a long time. the way, if you come to work here with us it is good that you know ... ... is an old man not at all polished, always in his study. If I were to meet, you will ask questions. Come. Look out! Christ, now, "I have done below." If you're not careful, over the nose leave us well as the neck. Do not run, I'm afraid the car! After 8 months you have not yet understood. But how? I the laundress for a loaf of bread ... The widow's pension, civil not even enough for the home ... ... And you give me this misery? Creatures from 8 years no longer have the typhoid and still have the same clothes. What the fuck! If a child do not send him by the priests was better. I did it to get eaten and these are the results! At 13 you could already work and earn your bread! A mother does so much for children and the children do not do anything for the mother. Here, Don Vito, for the poor. Baroness, the Church owes much to people like you ... ... Always ready to lend a hand, charitable towards those who suffer. There is no suffering that can't be relieved by a bit of money ... Other ... and instead ... Oh, I understand, Baroness, however, relieve the faith. In fact the only thing I have left. If I had the ... By the way, Don Vito, if he sees the rector of the seminary ... Tell him ... the guy who had recommended has become one of the family. Parsifal is really fond of him. I do not know what he would do without him. I've known him since he was a child. It was I who sent him to the seminary. Poor guy, if he had not had that defect ... Would be great ... a priest, really suited! Ah, if he knew, Baroness, how poor the family. But, you see when I said faith? After the disgrace of her husband the woman has found the strength to survive. Now I go, parishioners waiting for me. I wanted to say goodbye but Parsifal does not arrive. Gifts, Baroness. My compliments. But vaffan ... The face is ugly, but the ass is photogenic. Why so late? With this I would only go for a walk. Wait, I'll get the blanket. Come with me, please, is a bit we can not be together. It seems that Parsifal is spying on me all the time. Come on, I'm ready. Oh, look, here, take a bit of money if you want something Parsifal. Today we came Don Vito. Quick, give me some rocks. The detached tail continues to move ... I ... I have attached the legs I can not do. It better to be a lizard. Don Vito has come to take the check that the mother gives to the poor ... So ... maybe he thinks to buy a lot in paradise. You who are a bit priest think it is sufficient to pay for paradise? For heaven maybe not, but the newspapers are paid. Mom gave you the money, right? The usual, eh! Look, I'd do it this? But the priests think about these things? Yesterday I saw Brunilde that if he looked in the mirror. Here I saw. You marry her Brunilde? Mom always says that is the fault of dad if I am so ... So ... I hate it, family does not speak to anyone. Br?nnhilde, however, occasionally visits him ... but it is a pimp! Damn! You have to take him to hospital. I tried to curb and I think I succeeded. - Just as well, it did not happen nothing. - I was more afraid of him. - The show is free? - Bitch, today nearly died for "save me"! - I was going to end up under a machine. - It 's true, Don Hercules? You do not need hard you try, you can answer by yes or no with his head. Mm ... Brunilde wants you to wash your pants, and even underwear. - General of my ass, captain of the territory. - Come on! - General, grades also increase as a civilian! - Let's talk about serious things. Addolorata told me you talked to the factory. - They called me and I had to decide. - You do not take more decisions for a long time! The last decision you made 13 years ago walking in a wheelchair. Always the same story. Physicians pointed out that it is not my fault. I came up with anemia all the blood tests I've done. Right, it's never your fault In fact, I would go with the sluts there. "Woman and man the stove to the brothel." Remember the talk of your friends? Now I'm in charge here, and if you my balls them you are "played" with whores ... Them to me ... I have grown for you, okay? Prepare the machine, you go to the factory. How is it, you have allowed the visit in a cell? Parsifal cut off the head of the flies and his mother went to the plant. But you, Dad, why do you treat so? Why do not you rebel? You do not always accept all passively. Are as empty, I just want to sleep, to be at peace. So why have others, you're just a useless old man! Even if I died, no one would notice anyone! - There are exploiting, wretches! - It 's true. - It 's true. - Any news? - They are old things, Baroness, and every year the same. And this year, instead you want to change, and so you have disturbed the general. - And we also agreed. - By phone? For us the word of the general is worth more than a piece of paper. - That is nothing, you know! - All right. Give us what we gave him. Never! We do too. If I were not here to make wine that makes nothing, all would die of hunger. Or go back to work or close all and you go to hell! No! This can not mean, for God! Yokels! My Lady, what a beauty! Will finally be able to dress normally. Hear, hear that stuff! Never put. But we must stretch them, they are too short. Are you sure you have the give away? Hey, is not that case ... This is a good sign, my son, an intimate gift. Brunilde is already a woman of marriageable age. Do you understand? You're a fool! You have the opportunity and you nothing? Brunilde is ready, I know, a mother of these things is never wrong. And you, if you want it, take it! And then the woman Clotilde you will have to give by force. So will this misery. Mom, I thought that for breakfast in the morning I would take a nurse. Maybe a girl beautiful and prosperous, eh? Ah, come on, give me a hand wash. Come for a moment there, I need to talk. Addolorata, go on. Bitch, bitch, me out, is soon! Bitch! Come on! No, please, there's Brunilde at home, is not prudent. And hurry up, bitch! But fuck who you is dead! Baroness, help! Baroness! Come, Baroness! Help, help! Come, my husband killed himself! Crazy, but you do! But as you can think of? Now you want to take? Stupid! So if you notice it right away. Tomorrow, before closing the case. Be still, between little Addolorata brings us to eat. Then, Don Vito, here's the check. How do you see the figure is sufficient, I But the funeral of the highest order. The memory of General should be re-evaluated in the eyes of the people. Call all, orphans, children Mary ... her face that is practical. And you, please, occupied the wagon, the band ... Please come to the workers, peasants the estate. Make it big. - Pay all you need! - Mom! Mom! This is my stuff, I rightfully yours! Poor general. - You could not see and could not hear. - And you're still! They say it was strange. If there ever spoke no How did they know? But according to me was really good. Be ... eat the night is long. Fuck! - What did you say? - Nothing lady, as that's all changed. And now to bed, tomorrow will be a bad day. Throw away the bags. This is also done. Hello to all, good women. The sun is rising, we must begin the laborious day: Wake up! - Thank you ... - My respects for the disappearance. - Signature and shut up. Next another. Compliments. Cripple and asshole. - Signature and shut up. - Condolences. The general was a gentleman, a true gentleman. - Parsifal, come on in! Thanks for coming ... - Condolences. It was an accident. I can not imagine not to have it with me anymore. Clotilde, courage, you have to be strong, even for them. Oh, what a disgrace! And then your husband had his ripe old age. It overlooks ... dizzy, definitely. It's unfair die like this! On the other hand it was good, he did not want to see anyone ... And recently he wanted to ... eating alone in his room! And it's not "fucking" more for many years. Why do not you say? Who knows if the "bangs" bed must be a volcano. - I would try. - And why not me? What a disgrace, what a disgrace. Addolorata, make coffee. - Yes, with cabbage and sausages low heat. - Yes, everything in the pan. And without sauce, otherwise it's too heavy. Eh, my Gina, that trouble was to Clotilde. I still remember the day wedding, seemed father and daughter. - What a beautiful couple! - Does not seem to suffer much, though. - Maybe it was a liberation. - Fortuna who found the boy. - Mm? - Yes, that "Spretatino", for company. Mary, you and me you could not see from the funeral of George, is not it? - No, by the marriage of Federica. You were just "made the mink." - Oh, yes. Baroness, you're all set. If you want to get down to check ... Thank you, Don Vito, but me and my children stay here ... ... We would not have the strength to ... Wow, the "defrocked" ... If my husband tolerated, I would also like such an outstanding company. - We see that the general was a man of tolerance. - Mm-mm ... The coffee is served. In the name of the Father and of the Son ... Play! They're coming! - How old are you, child? - 14. - Carina. And what's your name? - Mary, the Virgin. - What do you do for a living, get married? - No, the presenter on TV. Stop, buy me an ice cream with the money you gave Mom. - She has arrived, Cadorna! - Yes, Cadorna in a wheelchair. It must be the son of that piece of ass Baroness Bezzi. My father worked for them, it was kicked out because he had gone on strike. Mm! He's bitch! That guy is one who has entered that was in the seminary. Lives in the ghetto. During the day you bring the lame walk, the evening "ride" the mother, right? Come . It punishes those who threaten structures of the Church with the facts and words. Without rancor or malice. pray and repent. Hey, when "fuck" makes you put the robe? Look out! We gave him a lesson. So learn to break my balls. Keep. And I did not even get "pissed"! You see, Mr. Donato, the workers do not you can afford no weakness. Sure. You have to pay, agree, the right though. Sure. Of course, you pay for and we claim. When someone does not satisfy us the more you chase it and pay another. You're absolutely right. Okay, I greet you. See you soon. May I ask why so puffy? You should call your service technician for my TV, you must route the antenna. Could you do it. We are in mourning, it would be nice that you did it yourself. Should repair "of the damo company ", at least that could do it. - At the end of the pay, right? - First, I'll pay, and then ... And then another thing. Since no studies risks and the college ... ... Instead of staying at home to criticize, advantage, dear, get out. Do as your peers. Is it possible that you do not have an affair? Do you think that in this city of slanderers easy it is to insert myself among others? I must conquer my space in this kind of circus you call family. With a father who jumps out window and a brother like mine ... You feel like you can have the ... friends that are not of the spirit? Thank you for leaving me out the museum of horrors. No, you're not excluded, only that your speech would be more complex. - Mom! - And then the two are coming. We'll talk later if you want. Mom, today we have beaten three boys who spoke ill of you! You saved Parsifal from the machine, defend the honor of a widow ... You just have to repair the antenna TV to enter in the Hall of Heroes. Please go on the terrace with Brunilde, adjust the damn TV. Listen, were three with faces ... Wait, I'll accompany, so you see how you adjust the antenna. You look like the portrait of Saint Sebastian the mom in the bedroom. But why a drum like you wanted to become a priest? I do not understand your position here with us. Mom says that you are the friend of Parsifal, friends do not pay, however. Let me see, you take the money and as a counterpart from the friendship? And then what? There are other benefits? Since my mother and servants Parsifal ... I ordered ... if I should make yourself useful to me, no? I am the family and the money are for everyone, even me. So, let's see. As before provide an easy thing, an opinion. Do you like these panties? On your sisters have the same effect? So, you decide? Courage, I do not ask tough performance. It 's just an opinion. I, for my emotions I do not need men. Oh, good, good ... riparala Brunilde ... so tonight will see "Mail father Mariano." After the investigation I can confirm the previous diagnosis. There are no lesions, then it is a nervous trauma. However, one should that she should go to Toulouse, France. This is a letter for Professor Valenti ... ... Which I think is the only specialist in this field. 40,000. Why are not you in bed? - So - I had to, Father. as if I had heard the voice of Madonna calling me to prayer. - So you called the Madonna, huh? - Yes, the Madonna. Bravo, okay. But now to bed! Ah, if I had to suffer the voice of Madonna, call me, we will pray together. We can not continue like this, please, you can not. - Why do not you marry her? - Go! Get out! - Maybe you do not want to because you're too stupid. - Damn! Yuck! I hate you, bitch bitch! Troiaccia cross-eyed! Shit woman! But that happened to that ... Will fight with Brunilde. I'm sorry. - What is it? - That bitch nasty your daughter always breaks my balls! - Look, if instead of the mirror I had the sword ... - Yes, but calm down. - You are always exaggerated reactions. - Ah, Mom, by the way! Yesterday on the terrace that bitch has done everything possible to provoke him. She got even skirts! But he did nothing, in fact he almost kicked out. Do you understand the bitch? We wanted him to cheat! I'll send you Addolorata to dress, you are quiet now. Your sister has joked. Brunilde is doing a dangerous game: I hate it. Even you hate her, I know. I saw yesterday on the terrace ... That stupid. You were a phenomenon. I told my mother, if her little sister is not careful, end up like Dad. Try to hurry up. But look at you ... Thank you, thank you very much. If you've dreamed of Madonna is a good sign. I'll talk to Donna Clotilde, you'll see, she will organize the trip. Thank you, you are very good. Thank you. Here, look how it's begging. - Stop making that noise from pig. - You do the nasty without noise. This is enough, Brunilde, you become intolerable! It's about time that can not stand you more. You look like the good soul of your father. The good soul became so because of you. And this we all know. In fact, why do not we talk a little? I'm sorry, I'll see you tomorrow, says Miss should clear things up. Look, dear, I'm warning you I can not stand more certain excesses. If you are not able to eat with others, you can do it alone in the room. Why do not you move in the room Dad, so you will be more peaceful. You could do like him, we lived so well ... In this house you have to put things right. Addolorata, the second! "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name ..." "... Thy kingdom come Thy will, as in heaven, so on earth." How are become severe, 28 "Salve Regina". Like me, 200 "Our Father" I did say Don Vito ... Because I spit ... my daughter's plate. Now that I put rat poison in the soup, I confess more. "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name ..." Daughter, sins of the flesh are the most difficult to combat. And the devil hidden in the folds skin stimulates us to sin. Father, I try to resist, but when I feel his hands on me ... - Then I pray and I feel better. - But good! Please. Good, my daughter, just so you can drive away the evil ... That returned to Earth ... decided to get lost. However, the right man wrongs you seven times per hour. Remember, are more festivals in the sky ... ... Over one sinner who repents for one hundred just men. I absolve you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Don Vito, if he wants to go to the poor ... By the way, Baroness, I'm organizing a pilgrimage to Lourdes. I thought if it were not the case to send also Parsifal. She is a pious woman, Baroness, Our Lady could ... Who knows? Don Vito, you know what a pain for me that child. Ah, if Our Lady hears me ... "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name ..." Mm ... that there has been two hours and goes away without repentance. I two minutes and I have to play 28 "Salve Regina". - "Hail Holy Queen, Mother of ..."- What are you want to do, godmother? That's Baroness. "Our Father, who art in heaven ..." Then, Parsifal, I decided, you go to Lourdes. Don Vito has arranged everything. Depart Sunday. He will accompany you. - I do not want to go, I'm afraid. - Of what? - I do not know, but I will not. Instead you should be happy. My son, Madonna does not hurt. If anything, the devil, that yes. - Do you think, you will see France! - There are the strip in Lourdes? No, we are in Paris. Then after I go to Paris. Mrs., Miss Brunilde me threw a bowl of soup in the face. - Scusala is very nervous in these days. - A time maid. I will describe the Baron Parsifal Bezzi goes to Paris. I wonder who he "fuck." Eh! Why in the dark? Are not you afraid? It is dark, do not see the light of the street? What is it? Tonight does not have a eating, not talking, you're in the dark ... - Do you feel sick? - No, no, I just think the trip. - In medicine there are hopes, I know. - What are you saying? Doctors hope always, and also I ... It's pointless for us to make fun of, Brunilde told me "a surly". Do not believe the stupid, is just angry. - We no longer talk to her. - It is not for her, I always knew it too. Now I'm afraid of Lourdes ... Do you account? If it goes wrong are "fucking"! - It is the last hope I have left. - You'll see, this time there will be grace. There must be! We paid us the journey Don Vito, also for others. Our Lady will also take account of this. But you do not be like that, you have to pray. Prayer and faith. - But how many will leave? - I do not know, fifty, maybe. - And we have paid for all. - No, we have contributed. Mom, you were stupid, do you realize? Fifty! If Madonna is the grace, we are more and less chance there. Made your money back. Mom, you and I are good together, now. Do not you think? But what would change in family if by chance come back healed? They are coming. Hopefully someone we do not die at the station. Rejoice, brothers! "On the hearts"! Faith wins! # - The soul who believes ... - Come. All ... grants. # Make them go away, soon arrives the team playing away from home. - Yes, yes, all right. # - Viva Jesus! # - Put it down. A second, listen up! Silence, silence! Now climb on the train. Please do not push, you hurting yourself. There is room for all. The head compartment is reserved for Bezzi. Got it? Don't worry, you understand? Now, dear children, many fervent greeting, a kiss of heart ... ... Pull it out, and Our Lady assist you. # - Oh, what a blessed day ... # - Come, come, in order. Bravo, young man. Go, you will return the child. Order! - By order! - # Viva Jesus! # - Well done, well, sing! Joy is faith! Faith is joy! # Soul who believes, grants. Soul who believes ... # I saw you with that stick! You have to stop, get it? Wait! That way! We hope that Our Lady face-to lose weight, you will be less intrusive. And who wants to lose weight? I want win the competition for new entries. - # Soul who believes ... # - # .. Heaven has given us ... # # Oh, what a blessed day, Jesus lives! Live Jesus! # On, and I recommend it to Lourdes returned early in the evening, do not be late. Hey, you, what are you doing? Always stick up! And you are also brothers. Shame on you! Who knows when we will be still together. Oh God, the 14:00! How late. You have to hurry, I'll go there to dress Parsifal ... Meanwhile ... you up the machine. If he wanted to go after Lourdes in Paris, take him. Take care, be good that even here you control. "We will win hands down!" "We will get into homes, homes against the wall and you'll break your ass." - # Oh, what a blessed day ... # # ... Heaven has given us! # # Oh, what a blessed day, and living Jesus! # - # Live Jesus! # - # Live Jesus! # Santa misery, but when do these? # Live Jesus! # Brunilde I was not even say goodbye. - When we get back I will send in college. - Permit? Need anything? Don Vito before leaving me recommended from time to time to move on. I want something to eat, and know when we will engage other convoys. The first coupling is between 7 hours, and for lunch will Miss Marconi. Now if you'll excuse me ... I would like to get some sleep, lay. Up, up, wake up, we stopped, are engaging. I'm Miss Marconi. I will come every so to see if you need anything. - If you expect a little one died of hunger. - But there are also others. Then a man fell ill and we took the car hospital. It takes patience. ... sounds in heaven our harmony ... ... Praise, praise, praise Mary. Mary, you lily pure whiteness ... That the heart fall in love ... verb of your son. Praise, praise, praise Mary. - Viva Maria! - Viva Maria. - Long live the Virgin! - Long live the Virgin! Good evening, if you please I sit here and my grandmother. This compartment is reserved to us, we can not sit down. My mother has paid for others, and so on! We, too, honey, we paid for the other, then we sit. So be it, since we have to travel together is better than going to introduce me. Teresa Auditori, and this is my grandmother. I am the Baron Parsifal Bezzi and this is my secretary. - It's the first time you go to Lourdes? - Yes, the other times I've been to Paris. My grandmother is very sick ... For three years ... we come to Lourdes in the hope of a cure. You have seen many healings to come to the sanctuary? - Miracles happen always, all they get. - Are you kidding? You see, dear, the miracle is not only heal from the evil one has ... The miracle is ... accept with humility and resigned his sufferings ... And find the faith ... the strength to live at peace. The miracle is to run a lawn flowers, even if you have the legs. We run with the imagination. The miracle is to see the nature ... See this miracle ... that has been repeated for centuries every second. It is God, and speaks to you in a hundred, a thousand ways. Just wanting to understand the message. I can not walk. I'm so since birth. I have no feeling in the legs and strength ... Continue to grow ... but it is as if they were detached from me ... ... As if I belonged. You think that in these conditions I could be happy? Happiness is not of this world. You see, life is a breath of eternity. We must prepare for the later, this is the only purpose of existence. So why ports your grandmother to Lourdes? Shortens the waiting of future happiness, kill ... So ... go to heaven and be happy. It would be unfair because life does not belong to us. You can not destroy what is not yours, you do not have the right. But who is he? He is my secretary. He was in the seminary, then was dismissed because he could not speak. But it is not just talk, you only stuttered. But then, eh? Do you think that to say "yes" it takes a month. - And he is hoping for a miracle? - No, not him, accompanies me. He cares about, he does. Thanks for everything, father. It;s been a long time you're forced to turn down the street? - For five years now. - If you want, I can help. No, thank you, honey, I'm used to. Indeed, after'll feed you too. Teresa, look, when we descend to Lourdes ... My friend ... will have to go to Toulouse bring a letter on behalf of the priest. - Can I go with you to the sanctuary? - Sure, honey, go together. Your friend will join us at the hotel. It's outrageous! It is not permissible that there is this promiscuity. At other times, the right ones, would not have happened. Dear lady, should be ashamed ... With the craft ... which is also the courage to come to the sanctuary. I do this job because of people like you. Are you our best customers. Our Lady knows how much I suffered. Dear lady ... Eh, ma'am ... By its norm and rule ... Men like me ... they gave blood to defend the homeland. - I "lost" an arm in Africa. - So learn to be more orderly. She has "lost" her virginity at 12 years ... Ssh! He fell asleep. Parsifal said you have to go to Toulouse. If you do not mind I could accompany I am the guy at the sanctuary. Poor baby, he was talking more of the devil than God - He was so scared. - Please, make way. - Nothing happened, not worry. - Nothing happened. Move her, please, let us pass. Here you are. Up, up, make-up. It did not happen no, ma'am, do not worry. A man fell ill, sorry. Inside! Go in! Nothing happened, there! All in! Still 10 hours, it is a journey unnerving. Good, good, it's nothing, I'm here, Grandma. Do not be afraid, it was a nightmare. Calm, calm down now, okay? He must have been dreaming, poor dear. Good, now, good ... - Are you scared? - A little, you know, I was sleeping ... Thank you! I do not have a boyfriend, men evidently do not find me beautiful. I think you're beautiful! If you wanted to, I would marry you. - I am very rich, you know? - But you're too young. I am rich, and hence ours would be a marriage of interests. Leave me alone, I'm talking about! When I hunger I will tell you! By dint of begging you can fall in love with God? There is a poem of a holy nun who was in love with God He says: ... "When the sweet hunter ..." "... Aimed the bow to dig in the arms of love ..." "... I fell right in vulnerata ..." "... But part of a new impetus and such a fire in m'arse chest ..." "... That the Beloved is mine I and all of the Beloved." "I was struck by a bolt of burning love ..." "... The soul so close close is joined to the Lord." "Or desire nothing more here He is here only for you my love." "The Beloved is mine, and I all ... all of the Beloved." It's beautiful, it is a beautiful prayer. But the hunter is the boyfriend? - No, it's the groom. - Ah ... - Saint Teresa of Avila spoke with God .. - Watch this. His beautiful body, in conversations levitating nell'aire. breasts quivering, the whole body tense in ecstasy ... ... contact ... contact Divine realized. mouths joined in offering sublime and soul hovering light ... - Oh, finally we arrived. - ... Genoa, Pisa, Rome. Wait for me there. Leave passports and will be right there. Well, well, well, well. Yes. Brava! Really good! All is well. We also have rooms close together. - How does it sound good. - Look "Chopin" as arpeggios. Brava! Brava! Look, I need to change, I'm all wet. You know, before Teresa I did not want to see that ... Before I go I need to do in Toulouse the bathroom, if not puzzer? like a toilet. Next. Permission? Well done, see you have unpacked. You go ahead, I will think about Parsifal.
