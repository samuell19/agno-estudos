I can not have a baby - Katy - It is okay. It is okay. I am just I was pregnant once years ago but I lost my baby Come here I am sorry I am so sorry I am so sorry It is okay, it is okay Afterwards, the doctors told me I had something called balanced translocation so I can get pregnant, but... the chances of carrying a baby to term are not good I am really sorry, Katy It is okay, it was years ago and then I got my job as a maternity nurse and it helped so much because it is like every baby that I bring into the world It is like I am their mother, too Yes So I want to help you and it is not just because you need it, and you do But I need it too I can understand that I am a hot mess I am a mess too, you know - Hey - Hi Are you sick of this yet?

I do not know what you mean You are here every morning when I get here Every night when I leave all without pay I am just curious How does a nurse find herself with so much free time? You know, I could ask you the same question Okay, I know you are not so fond of me being here There is no need to be jealous - Oh, I am not jealous - Okay If you say so. You know if you actually tried to be... pleasant maybe you would find your patients more receptive to your help - Hey. More tea - Hi Oh, gosh. You read my mind - How you feeling? - You know, I do not know I... Lately, I have just been feeling really... foggy That is just mommy brain at work That is completely normal - Yes? - Yes Okay, it just, it feels more than that You know, like I feel like I can barely function Well, I mean, that is what I am here for I am here to take care of you you do not have to worry about anything That reminds me. Irene said it is time for your medication Is it these over here? Yes, whatever those are over there Okay - Oh, my God - What? Are you Are you taking this baclofen? Yes, I have been taking whatever is over there, like like one a day How long have you been taking this? I do not know, about a week. Why? Is it... Is it bad for the baby? I did not know that If it is just a week, it is okay because I caught it in time but you should not be taking this She should know better Oh, my Are you new? She can not have these What? What is wrong? Look at this date These were prescribed before she was pregnant What? No, those were not in the prescriptions I picked up Then how did they end up with the rest of her medication? - I do not know - You do not know I guess I am going to have to check all of them in case there is anything else you do not know that could harm her baby This is exactly why I am here so much I guess I am going to have to keep an eye on everything you are doing How about I report this to your supervisor? You think they are going to let you stay on after that? That is what I thought - ''So'' - Okay, bye - ''I love you'' - Okay - Hey, I found you - Hi I thought you might have made a break for it I tried, see how far my little legs could take me but, uh, nice little vacation to the office Time for your medicine. You know we did not take them before - Right. Thank you - Got distracted Hey, is that David? Yes, that is him You just missed him Oh, yes, yes I heard you guys talking I just did not want to intrude No. Please intrude I want you guys to meet Oh, we can meet when he gets here in person It is not like I am going anywhere True Hey, thank you for catching that and just keeping eye on everything - Sure - No, I really mean it I mean, you have saved my life and. God, I just do not know how I would get through this without you You do not think you would have survived under Nurse Ratchet's reign of terror It might have been a little more difficult, but... Well, I am here And if she ever gets to be just too much for you to handle I am a maternity nurse. Just saying No, I appreciate that it is really sweet But no, I do not, I do not think I can do that to her Besides, I really do think it was just an honest mistake I mean, it happens to the best of us - Oh. Can you do a favor for me? - Sure So, I went to the hospital for my check-up with Irene And I left my phone there Yes. I have been working on my laptop. But it is, it is Oh, yes, I know. I get it. I have I can not go an hour without my phone Irene would not just go back and get it for you? I asked her and she said going back into Milton would be difficult or... - Really? - Yes Something like that I do not know I did not want to press it Weird - Yes. No, I will totally do that - Really? Yes, oh, yes. Absolutely Are you done with these? Yes, yes, yes. Yes All right, then I will go get that phone - Thank you - Sure You are the best - What are you doing? - What do you mean? I heard you talking to Tricia Wow. Eavesdropping Another point in your column Are you trying to get me fired? I am trying to look out for an unborn child Sorry, if that conflicts with whatever you are trying to do Just stay out of my way No. You stay out of my way You are lucky you are even still around here But do not worry, you will not be for long. Excuse me Excuse me? Hey! A friend of mine came in yesterday for an appointment and she thinks she left her phone Her name is Tricia Rosen She is a patient of Dr. Rupp Yes. We have been holding on to it for her Great. Thank you How do I know you are not just going to score free phone? You can call her if you want Tricia Rosen I think you know her home care nurse. It is Irene Warnick - Her - Yes - She is really something, huh? - You have no idea - Really? - After the stunt she pulled I am surprised she found work until her suspension is up She mentioned something about that But she did not really elaborate What did she do? You know I can not tell you that Oh, yes But do you really want to cover for somebody like her? I mean, she is taking care of my friend so I really need to know I mean, I, I get the confidentiality thing because I am, I am a nurse, too You can tell me, you know just one nurse to another Tricia, I am here What is going on? Irene, were you suspended for stealing medication? How did you - You told her - So it is true? Is that what you have been doing here? Have you been stealing from me and then lying about it? - No - Then how do you explain this? This bottle was half full when I threw it away yesterday It was not me Tricia, you have to believe me No, this just is not going to work No. No. I have not done anything Tricia, you need someone to take care of you Yes, she does. She has me And I can be trusted to do my job - Shut up - Okay Irene, there is nothing left to talk about I am sorry Please, I, I know what this looks like but I can not lose this job Tricia, I am taking care of my mother She is sick and does not have insurance I can barely afford the medication - She is lying. That is disgusting - Katy Do you think I like living like this? Having to steal to take care of my mother? Tricia, please Please, do not report me I can do better, I promise Just please, please keep me on I am sorry about your mom I, I really did not know Okay. Maybe we can try to work something out - I - Tricia! This is your baby's safety we are talking about You do not know if she is telling the truth Would you really risk your baby to someone you can not trust? I am sorry, Irene. Katy is right I... I can not trust you to take care of us anymore I am going to have to let you go - It is okay - It is fine "Rachel?" I do not keep any drugs in there - I was not - Of course you were You are really pathetic you know that? Look, I do not know what your deal is but I promise you I am going to find out No, you are not And you know why? Because you are a desperate lying thief who can not afford to be out of work And if I report you I am going to make sure your nursing license gets revoked Good luck taking care of your mom when nobody will hire you - You are a monster - No I am just very protective Do not ever show your face here again - Hey - Hey I know you are still feeling guilty but it had to be done I know, I know, I just Guess I just feel so bad for her, you know? Do not. I mean Somebody like that should not be allowed to take care of anybody I know you are right. I know All right, but now that she is gone I can finally make sure that you and Hope get the best care possible What are you talking about? Oh, well, you are doing a little over a week, right? So we want to make sure everything is set for Hope What is that? What are you doing over there? It is a speaker we are going to play classical music on it so that Hope can enter a soothing familiar world Okay, and I got some prenatal supplements - These are fantastic - What are they? Do not make me pronounce them You will take them in the morning - Okay - Katy, is that a breast pump? Yes You want me to pump before I even deliver? Well, if you can so not all moms have milk before delivery but anything you can do would be so fantastic for Hope even if it is just a little bit - So, we will give it a shot? - Katy I, I do not think that is necessary I do not even think that that is normal Tricia, I understand you are anxious, it is your first child And I have helped hundreds of moms with their babies I know what I am talking about Trust me. Okay? - Okay - Okay. All right I am going to let you get started I will give you some privacy I will be right out here if you need me Katy? Hey. Hey, what is up? Do you know what happened to the internet? - No. It is not working? - No, it is not It just shut itself off Oh. Oh, I will take a look I am not very technicaI though so bear with me, okay? It... I just really need this It is my only way to talk to David and I really need to post on my channel and... Honestly, it is for my sanity I feel so disconnected right now Do not be silly You have me, but... You know I will totally take care of that for you, okay? Oh, did you get my cell phone when you went to the hospital? I completely forgot to ask you when Irene was here I asked, they did not have it I am so sorry But I will keep asking in case they find it. Okay? - Okay - Okay You get to pumping - Adele! - Nah-uh! You just turn around I do not have time for this right now - Adele, listen to me - No, you listen to me I just got a call from Tricia Rosen Said she had to let you go Would not tell me why but she did not sound too pleased I knew you was not ready for another job No, I did not do anything Just like you did not do anything at Milton General to warrant a suspension Irene, if you are looking for another job, you can forget it That is not why I am here Actually, I need a favor Wow. I wish I had your optimism Please, this is not about me I am worried about Tricia and her baby She has this friend who has been helping around the house Katy Lyle A maternity nurse but working off the clock I have no idea why but she has been trying to push me out since day one And today I found this You found this? Okay. An expired license Not just that. Look at the name She has been lying about who she is Now, I am guessing Katy Lyle will not pop up as a registered nurse anywhere But I was wondering if you could check the system and see what comes up for Rachel Daumler Come on aren't you a little concerned? A woman posing as a nurse taking care of a mother and her unborn daughter? Thank you It is not for you. It is for them - What? - Well, according to this her license is not just expired It has been revoked - Oh, God - Katy I told you not to come back here - You hypocritical little bitch! - Excuse me? You heard me, Katy Or should I call you Rachel? I do not know what you are talking about I think you do I looked up your file Your license was revoked over a year ago You are delusional You know what was listed under the reason? - "Patient abuse and neglect" - I have heard enough Leave now or I am calling the police No. You are going to leave The police are going to know that you have been practicing without a license And first, Tricia is going to know who the real liar is And you are never going to be alone with her again Oh, my God! Okay What is she dragging? Maybe it is a dead body ''Man, I can not believe you had to fire her'' Oh, God, I know I really feel bad about her mom It was so awful ''Thank God Katy is there'' ''I do not know what we would have done'' ''I am so sorry I am missing all these'' ''I feel terrible'' No, babe I am the one that told you to go And, things with Katy are... good ''Really?'' Yes. Mostly. I do not know Actually, since Irene has been gone she has been kind of kind of different ''Oh, I really miss you I hate that I can not see your face'' We miss you too You know, I wish I could see you This stupid internet is still down Katy said she called someone and I... would try to fix it.
