CLOSING REMARKS It sure snows a lot up here. Yeah. Did you ring your mother? What's the rush? I'll call her when I know when we'll arrive. Do you think school will work out? - What do you mean? - You know. It's going to be a lot different. - It won't be that different. - But... And it's only for a year and a bit. It's close to the house. It's perfect. Hm? I told her we were coming. Yura, get out of the car. Hello. It's open. - Do you always leave it unlocked? - Yes. Isn't that dangerous? You should lock it properly. There's nothing here to steal anyway. We haven't seen you in ages. It hasn't been that long. I'll take that. Okay. So, come on in. - Did you bring anything else? - Of course we did. We can handle it. - Are you sure? - Yes. Then come on in. You want Yura to go to school tomorrow? Isn't that a bit too much? You think so? He's not familiar with this place yet. He doesn't even know the way to school. The way to school? It's just over there. Yura, have you cleaned up? What are you doing? Does this thing work? I think it's broken. It spins, but there's no noise. Either way, you need to go to bed. - Where do I sleep? - Over there. - The Japanese-style room? - Yeah. I sleep with grandma? There's no room for a futon here. Come on. You have school tomorrow. Yura. See the holes? Your grandpa made all of them. With his finger. I used to put up new paper every time he made them. But it became too much of a hassle. But now he's gone, I guess I should redo them. Why did he make them? The holes? I wonder why, too. Hey, that was dangerous! Play over there! - Shut up. - Yeah, shut up. Good morning, kids. Sit down. Everyone to their seats. Come on. Sit down. Hurry up and sit down. Mikami will do the call today, and you should come in. Go for it. All rise. Attention. Bow. Good morning. Do it again. I want stronger voices, and say it together. Stop complaining. Once more. - Attention. - Okay. Bow. Good morning! Okay. Good morning. Be seated. Before I check attendance, as of today, we'll have a new student joining us in the 5th grade. Really? Who is it? Don't sound so surprised. I told you about him last Friday. He's going to introduce himself now, so listen up. Go for it. I'm Yura Hoshino. I came from Tokyo. "It's nice to meet you." It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you. Applause! Sit over there. Now I'll check attendance. Kazuma Okuma. - Here. - Okay. - Daisuke Kajita. - Here. - Tatsuya Sasagawa. - Here. - Mikami's here, right? - Yes. - Megumi Morishita? - Here. - Aya Yamaguchi. - Here. - Daisuke Yoshioka. - Here. Okay. - So, let's go to worship. - It's time for worship! Hey, don't run! I said, "Don't run!" Come on. What's wrong? - Where are we going? - Oh... We're going to worship. Is that like morning assembly? Well, something like that. Do you have a bible? I see. When we go to worship, you can use these books here. This is a bible and a hymnbook. Okay? Let's go. Please be seated. Today's scripture is from the New Testament. Chapter Two from the Gospels of Luke. Verse 11. Page 103. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. Now Mr. Kogure will provide us with a sermon. Good morning, children. Good morning! We have only three weeks left in this, our second term. Yesterday, which was a Sunday, we entered the second week of Advent. So, we now have two candles lit on the Advent crown in the entrance. Remember how we have a total of four candles on the Advent crown? We lit the first candle last week, and the second this week. We'll light the third candle next week, and the fourth the week after. All rise. Attention. Bow. Thank you, sir. Be seated. Open your books to page 52. So, in our last math class, we learnt how to find the area of a parallelogram, right? Today, we're going to actually try to calculate one. But before we begin, what other shapes have I taught you the way to calculate the area? - I do! - Go for it. - Rectangles. - Rectangles. That's right. - What other shape? - I know! - Squares! - Yes, that's right. I know one! - Triangles! - Not yet, actually... JOHN 14:6. "JESUS SAITH UNTO HIM..." As for parallelograms... THE HOLY BIBLE THE BOOK OF HYMNS ...we multiply base by height. So, who knows what we mean by "height?" - I do! - Go for it. The distance between the top and the bottom... Hurry up! You're so slow. - Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. Hello. - Master Hoshino? - Yes. I thought it might be you. When did you arrive? You came from Tokyo, right? Yesterday. Yesterday? It must be tough. I'm okay. I'm sorry about your grandfather. - Did you know him? - Yes. He came to our Sunday service. Sunday service? We open our chapel as a church for people to worship at on Sundays. Were you close with your grandfather? No, I didn't really know him. I see. I should have guessed. Do you have a bible? He said I could use one from the classroom. - Mr. Warita said that? - Yes. I see. Is your house nearby? Yes. What was your old school like? It was a local, normal school. Oh, Yura. This is a normal school too, you know? Let me give you this. If you have any problems, my door's always open. Okay. What can one do? You sure drop a lot of things. I don't drop them. They just fall. What's the difference? Look, Yura. Want some of this? Give a proper answer. No, thank you. Don't drop them this time. He looks a bit glum. Actually, he's always like this. He is? Do you think you'll fit in at school? Yeah. He won't get used to school that easily. I didn't ask if he will get used to it. I'm asking if he thinks he'll fit in. What's the difference? Did you make any friends? Yeah, I did. Really? That's great. LUKE 1:37 "FOR WITH GOD NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE" So... I was wondering. What is it? Who's this? That's God, isn't it? God? Does he really exist? Good question. What's your answer? Do you think he exists? Well... I don't think he does. Then I guess he doesn't exist. What are you making? Good question. You can't answer anything. Let's go to worship! Now it's time for the Lord's Prayer. "The Lord's Prayer." Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever Amen. Let's be seated. So, why do you think the factories are in Thailand? - Any ideas? - Yes. - The cost of labor is cheaper. - Yes, it is. - The land is cheaper. - Good point. In Thailand, they always Thai their best. We're supposed to laugh. Okay. Let's all take a look at page 71. Let's go! THE HOLY BIBLE Dear Jesus, I hope I make friends at this school. Amen. JESUS There she is! Come on. Okay. What a relief. That's the third time she's escaped. What were you doing? Nothing really. Do you like soccer? Yeah. You're really good. Want it? Do you? Come on. Take it. Hey. You can let me touch it. Touch it if you can. Sorry. - Are you okay? - Yeah. It's mine! Don't cheat. Are you still getting along with that friend of yours? What? Your friend. You said you made one. Yeah, we're cool. Really? What's his name? Kazuma. Of course they're still friends. People don't fight that often. You never know. Sometimes you're only friends at the start. Really? Why don't you bring him over some time? Invite Kazuma here? I wonder what he's like. So, what's he like? He's super good at soccer. So, he's a popular boy. That's good news. Do you play soccer together? That's nice. What should I wish for? Will anything do? Okay. Please give me money. Maybe that was too much. Oh, my. How nice of you to do it yourself. Won't you light this? Not now. I lit one this morning. Do you want to light it? Okay. Here. Is that enough? You shouldn't blow it out. Use your hand. Like this. That's right. Something happened today. I found your grandpa's secret stash of money. His secret stash? Yes. See? Where was it? You know the painting on the wall outside your grandpa's room? It was behind that. You can keep it. Really? It could have been more. I mean... His secret stash was only 1,000 yen. I wonder why. Hey! - What are you doing? - I'm making putty rubber. - Is that fun? - It's heaps of fun! You should try. Okay, maybe I will. By the way, did you hear there will be a meteor shower tonight? For real? For real. They said it will be really colorful. - That's definitely a lie. - I'm serious. - You're lying, right? - I never lie. I'm not interested anyway. I'm going to make putty rubber. Hey, Kazuma. There's going to be a meteor shower tonight. - I told you to stop lying. - I said it's not a lie. - You are lying. - Whatever. Be seated! He's here. Today, you're all going to sit a pop quiz. Pass them along. Put everything away except for your pencil case. Don't look yet. Keep them face down. Okay. - Everyone got one? - Yes. It will be cold tonight. Put on some warm clothes. - Will the weather hold out? - It's been fine so far. Really? But with events like this, you usually end up seeing nothing. Don't say that. He always says things like that. Can I ask you something? What exactly are meteor showers? You don't know what you're going to see? They're like shooting stars. A whole bunch of shooting stars will fly by. So, you can make a lot of wishes. Yeah. Because you'll see one after the other. I'll get it. Maybe it's Kazuma. It might be. Hello? Yeah. Not yet... Everything's turning out okay. I think he's having fun. - You're late. - Sorry. I can't see anything. - Can you stay out a bit longer? - Yeah. Are you sure your mom won't worry? They're fine. I told them all about it. Okay. What about yours? I think my mom was a little bit worried. It's this way. - You go first. - Hey, don't push me. - Hurry up. - Why are you pushing me? Because I don't want to go first. - Come on. - You go first. Okay, follow me. The classroom looks different at night. You think so? We can't see a thing here, either. Hey, Yura. I can't see a single star. Really? But we'll see a lot soon. - There's one! - I see it! - There, too! - It's beautiful! - There's a shooting star! - Wow! Please come true! Okay! I said my wish three times. I only said mine once. Wow. That's beautiful. Who are you trying to impress? I'm not trying to impress anybody. Yura? Kazuma's here. There they are. And we spread these out. All out. - 3,000 yen... - Which do you want? I'll have the blue one. Blue? Why? It's my lucky color. - Blue's lucky for you? - Yeah. - It's just your favorite, right? - Maybe you're right. So... - There you go. - Thanks. - Which one should I pick? - This flag looks cool. I think I'll take the white car. - Wow. - You have a flag. I'll have one, too. Red for me. All of your pieces are blue! - Thanks for my 3,000 yen. - Let's decide who goes first. Rock, scissors, paper. One more time. - Yay! - I lost. Six. - Could have been better. - You're right. One, two, three, four, five, six. "You can choose to be a politician." - "Your salary will be 30,000 yen." - 30,000 yen! Wow! "If you choose this career, take a card and move three spaces." - That sounds cool. - What will you do? I will become a politician. Lucky you. Okay, here goes. Five. One, two, three, four, five. "You became a teacher." "Your salary is 10,000 yen." A teacher? "Sit down, Sasagawa!" "Stop that now! Do you want to stand in the hall?" "I heard that!" Your turn. Okay. Oh, your 10,000 yen. Thanks. I nearly forgot. Five. One, two, three, four, five. "You buy a holiday home." "It costs 30 million yen." Wow. I don't have that much money. Only really rich people buy holiday homes, right? - I don't know about that. - Definitely. I have a holiday home. Really? But we haven't been for a while. Take me next time. Like, when? Winter break starts next week, right? It's not that big a place. I don't mind. But we always get stuck halfway there. What do you mean? When it snows too much, you can't drive the car. That's okay. We can walk from there. It's not a distance that you want to walk. Please! - Okay. I'll ask my mom. - Cool! Here goes. Know what? I've never actually reached the goal in this game. Is it that difficult? I don't know, but... - I always run out of money. - You do? Oh, there I am. One, two. Hm? You got it. It's not catching fire. This is difficult. Mom. This won't light up. That can be quite hard to light up. Oh, you're using matches. Be careful. Have you gotten a splinter? - You're okay? - I'm fine. It's okay. I'll do it. Come on. I don't want you burned. I can do it. Why don't you take a look outside? Why not? You should show Yura around. Do you want to? Okay. Okay, let's go. KAZUMA Here you go. Thanks. And some for Yura. Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Now let's make a prayer. Dear father, which art in heaven, Today is a very special day; it's Christmas Eve. We thank you for letting Yura join us, and for helping us arrive safely. Kazuma. You have to pray properly. But Yura had his eyes open. If you noticed his eyes were open, that means yours were open, too. Let's pray once more from the beginning. Dear father, which art in heaven, Today is a very special day; it's Christmas Eve. We thank you for letting Yura join us, and for helping us arrive safely. Have you ever noticed how your mom is always laughing? She looks like such a fun mom. Really? She smiled the whole time when I was at your house. If she smiled the whole time, that would be scary. There you are. It sure is cold. - Is your cocoa still warm? - It's cold. Want me to add some more? - Yes, please. - Okay. And she always prays. What? Your mom. Like I said, if she always did something, it would be scary. Has she always been like that? Yeah. For a long time. It sure is cold. Be careful. I'm so sorry. Here's some for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And you. - That will do. - Okay. What time will we leave? Sometime before lunch, I guess. Really? - You want to play more? - Yeah. I know the feeling. But the traffic gets really bad. What's wrong? Restroom. Okay. You've got a mustache. Just kidding. What a face! He said you're always laughing. - Really? - That's what Yura said. Me? That's nice. - Are you cold? Really cold? - I'm cold. He's cold! Don't run away. I win! But you had a head start. That wasn't fair. - Who would have guessed it was this far? - You're right. - Let's make a donation. - Okay. Five yen coins bring good luck. - Here. - Thanks. What did you wish for? What about you? I wished to kick a lot of goals today. What about you? - You're not supposed to tell people. - Why not? - If you do, they won't come true. - That makes no difference. It does make a difference. - Tell me. - No way. How many goals will you kick today? Well, I'll do my best. - But I want to kick a few. - Really? I want to be in the same team as Kazuma. - Do you mind if I join your team? - Well, I don't know. Give me a reservation. You can make reservations? We can make reservations. Go for it, Kazuma! Go for it! Shoot! Way to go, Kazuma! Okuma is tearing you to shreds. Start from the center. He beat me. Keep your chin up, Hoshino. Okay. From the center. Wait for my cue. Start. Make a pass. Okuma, is that your third goal? Number three? Wow. Keep an eye on Okuma. - Are you okay? - Come on, Hoshino. Back to the center. That's where we restart. Sorry. Hey, Hoshino! Where are you going? Hey! Hoshino! Come here. What happened? Okay, keep playing. Hoshino, come back! - Today was fun. - Yeah. But in the end, we got massacred. He's too strong. Where's Yura? No idea. He probably went home. Really? I reached the goal. Will the amazing Kazuma go all the way to the goal? He passed one player. He's approaching the goal. Will he get on the scoreboard? He takes aim... There he goes! Yes? I want to visit him in hospital. A visit... That's still a little difficult. Why? Well... His condition isn't good enough yet. So, we should just do what we can. Let's pray. Take me to Kazuma. NAKANOJO HOSPITAL Kazuma? Kazuma. Then when can you come? Don't you understand the situation? It's always the same. You'll never change. You only care about yourself. Come on out. Why won't you show? I'm begging you. Please come out. Who's leading the prayer today? We're going in order. It's Sasagawa's turn. I did it yesterday. Then please begin. What's wrong, Sasagawa? Don't you care whether he comes back or not? Fine. I'll lead today. Okay. Let us pray. Sasagawa. You can at least close your eyes. Our father which art in heaven, Our brother, Okuma, is currently in a battle with pain. One never knows what will happen, but I've never felt so powerless before. However... Jesus said... "Ask, and it shall be given you." These words provide us with strength, and we pray each day. Many of us are anxious about Okuma. Please show them they have no reason to fear. We trust all to your great hands... Mother. I won't be here tomorrow. Would you be able to make dinner? - I could do that. - Thank you. Hold that bit there. And we put this bit here. Then... We unroll. Perfect. You're good at this. Go down that side. Nice and straight. Will it reach? Good. It reached. Perfect. Hello? She's not here at the moment. Yes? I see... Good morning. What's this? It's a floral tribute. Floral tribute? What's that? The teacher put them there, just now. Is it always done so quickly? I don't know. Hoshino. Can I have a word? Your button's undone. Fix it. Did you hear we'll have a memorial next Monday? Yes. I'd like you to read a message of condolence. Do you know what that is? No, I don't. It's like a letter. Who is it to? To Okuma, of course. You just say goodbye. And then, when that's over, I'd like you to lead the prayer, too. Can you do it? It was Kazuma's mother's idea. She wants you to do it. I'll contact your mother about it, too. Can you do it? Yes, I can. Sir. The prayers were meaningless. What? Sorry, it's nothing. What about the time you went to see the meteor shower? You can add that, then make your final copy. The poor kid. You want blue ones, right? Yes. Do you want just one? Or do you want a bouquet? Whichever. How much are you planning to spend? - How many can I buy with this? - 1,000 yen? If you like these, you can buy three. Or five of those. Then I'll take them. Okay. Running errands? Well, yes. Let me wrap them first. That's quite a wrinkled 1,000 yen note. Now we're going to hear a letter and a prayer for Okuma. Yura Hoshino will read them for us. THE HOLY BIBLE "Dear Kazuma, When I first came to this town, and this school, and I had no friends, you were the first one to be my friend. Soon after we became friends, we heard there would be a meteor shower. That night we walked all over the place, but we didn't see a thing. We pretended we saw some, and we laughed. That was fun. You were good at soccer, you were smart, and you were good-looking. You were the most popular kid. I wanted to be just like you. I thought we would be together forever. Why did you have to go? Now that you're gone, I truly am lonely. I don't know what I should do. But when we grow up, I hope we meet again. I look forward to playing soccer with you again. I'll try to play a bit better by then. From Yura Hoshino." Are you okay? Let us pray in silence. Do you like soccer? Yeah.
