Get down. Go on, go. - We'll just pick one apple. - I said go, now. Just one apple. My mouth's watering. One apple, and then I'll get down. You'll break the branch. Totonel, take one for me, too. - I took one for him too. - Fine, go, go on. TOTO AND HIS SISTERS - Where is the other cloth, Andreea? - On the table. Nobody is perfect... Shouldn't we throw this away? It's broken. Leave it, we'll keep it for dishes. - We can put them on the table, Ana. - No, we'll cook on that table. When mother returns she should find the house cleared and we can start again from scratch. Toto. Your sisters are cleaning. I see, they only called me to take out the garbage. - When is you mother coming back, Andreea? - That's none of your business. Look. - Too big? - Too small. Then they won't fit me either. Sister, are you listening? Put some cream on here. But go easy, easy... I really have to wash your feet. Wash your feet. Get down from the bed. Hurry up. Easy you idiot, leave me alone you fucking retard. Ana, I'm hungry. I'll make a dumpling soup. But later on, I have no cooker now. But I'm hungry. Here, take this. - Make him that soup. - Wait, I have to make a cooker. I'm starving. Easy, easy. - Sile, how many lines will you make? - I don't know yet. I make them close so that it boils faster. But until you make the soup... I will fall asleep. Ana, come get up. I'll be damned if I let you junkies in the house anymore. - Shut up. - You shut up. I haven't been here in a month. - Help me shoot up. - Fuck off, I'm not helping you. I don't want drugs now. You like it here, right? - You like it here, right? - What? - Relax, I'll give you some too. - Out with all you fucking junkies. - I'll fix you up right now. - Leave me the fuck alone. Here, take the food and fuck off. It took me all day to clean the house. For fuck's sake, one leaves and ten come back. God help that you all go to prison. I'm praying for that. Whoever comes into this house should end up in prison. There we get food, three times a day. Every morning tea, butter and jam. That's something. Here we've got nothing. I sold the phone and a Louis Vuitton handbag. Listen, for the bag and the phone I got 95 lei. For the bracelet I got 10 lei. TÂRGŞOR PENITENTIARY Good morning. - How are you, Siminica? - Fine. Could be worse, right? - You have two kids? - Three. Two girls and one boy. What's your little boy's name? Horvath Ilie Nicuşor Gabriel but we call him Totonel. Totonel? Who is looking after them? - My brothers. - I see. I just wanted to know. Petre Siminica, convicted seven years for drug trafficking. Her sentence started on 30.01.2007 and will finish on 29.01.2014. To qualify for parole she had to serve 2/3 of her sentence. She has served 4.5 years. She didn't make any serious efforts to integrate socially. Parole is not a given. Just serving 2/3 of your time is not enough. You have to prove that you want to get out and be a different person. That's why you are serving time. Anyway, we discussed and analyzed your case and the commission has postponed your release. Do you understand? Please sign the report. There. Both copies. Keep seriously in mind what I am telling you. If you don't make any effort, you'll have three more years to serve. Is this what your children deserve? Getting out of prison is in your hands. You can return to your cell. - 03:00. - 03:00 or...? - 04:00. - No. 15:00. Why didn't you write that? - Good morning. - We already finished the test, Totonel. I'm sorry for being late, Miss. - Yeah, right... - I couldn't get up. How long do you sleep, stupid? - Gabriel, how are you? - Fine. I was dead tired, Miss. I couldn't make it at eight. - Why? - I didn't sleep last night. Come here. This is your evaluation test. - But I did this one already, Miss. - It was a similar one. These are clocks. Write down what time they are showing. Here, you work it out. That's all. - Don't rush this time. - Yes. - Is it fish, Ana? - No, it's paté. Close the door, girl. It stinks outside. What the fuck do you want? It stinks outside. So what? It stinks because of you, anyway. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Did you talk to mother lately? Yeah, right. Did she call you? How would she call? I wanted to write, but how? If I can't write. You write to her. - I don't want to. - Then shut up. She will be home for my birthday. - Leaving again? - What should I do, Ana? Go on then. Leave. Move it, bitch. Let go, idiot. Don't push me like that. Go back to your friends' place. - Don't come back. - I won't. I don't care about her. She can do with her life whatever she likes. I'll do what I want with mine. That's it. She's cutting my hair. Let me hold your camera. Nicoleta, you have to hold it straight. Understood? Here, take it. Don't film from here and hold it straight. Film from behind where she's doing the hair. I'm curling my hair. At my best friends. I have great friends. What a face. So, tell me, Miss Andreea Petre Violeta. Well, at home I don't get along with my family. My friend went to Turkey with her mum, so I'm staying at her house. She invited me so I stayed. Tonight she'll come back. I stayed here for two days. Kitty, you stay inside. Come and see where I throw away my hair. So that it grows, you know? BUCHAREST DRUG TASK FORCE ARCHIVE Open up! Police, open up! Everybody get down! Get down! Stop it! We have children! We have children! - Where is Totonel? - School. Your sister got arrested. This place fucking stinks. - What are you doing here? - I'm waiting for Uncle Ilie. When did they arrest Ilie? I don't know. I wasn't at home when it happened. - Where were you? - I slept at a friend's place. - You're waiting for him here? - I want to see him... ...because they also took my sister. Has she been locked up? - And what about Totonel? - He's at school. - And who's taking care of him now? - Sile and Ilie. - How, if Ilie was arrested? - I was just used to saying that. Andreea, be good. CHILDREN'S CLUB - Good morning. - Welcome, Andreea. - How are you, mademoiselle? - Fine. - What did we agree on Friday? - What? - What did we agree on? - That I will sleep at home. - And where did you sleep? - At a friend's. Andreea, if Totonel tells me one more time that you left him alone, you'll be in trouble with me. Even if this friend gets hit by a car, you still have to stay with Totonel. No matter what, you stay with Totonel. Alright? - Today, you'll read. - Oh, my God. Which sign is this pointing to the right? Less than. - Greater than. - Oh, greater than. So... greater. Look at me. - Two equal numbers? - Five and five. Five equals five. In order to understand... - "The ones from..." - No, "The..." "The two..." - "... siblings..." - Yes. "... have left..." "... for..." "... this..." "... place..." "Have left for this place." Full stop. Case #30591, March 2011. - Defendant Badulescu Ana-Maria. - Present with appointed attorney. So you are...? - Do you have any I.D.? - No. - What is your name? - Petre Andreea Violeta. - Adriana? - Andreea. - Are you the defendant's sister? - Yes. Parents: Badulescu Siminica, Badulescu Daniel-Leonid. Well, let's hear from the undercover witness. Can you hear us? - Yes, sure. - Fine, I'm listening. In February, I wanted to buy heroin, because I'm a drug user. I see. Continue. Someone introduced me to her and I bought heroin from her, twice. - How much did you pay? - 50 lei. - And the second time? - 25 lei. What is your position now? Do you still deny the offence? I'll keep to my statement. I won't confess anything. You won't? Fine. The court adjourns to deliberate the case. Wake up. Come on, stop doing that. I want to sleep more. Then sleep. Petre Siminica, your children are visiting. Sit down. Don't cry. Where is Ana? What's wrong? I can't wait for you to come home. Just a bit longer and your mother will be home. The waiting will soon come to an end. Are you really coming home or will they keep you another year? No, maybe one or two months more. I should stop telling you things. Who drugged her? Who? Your brothers. Who else? - You keep out of trouble. - I will. I did for so long. I will be home soon and this will end. See, you wanted to move to this neighbourhood and look what a beautiful family we became. Totonel! Andreea, will you sleep at home tonight? That's none of your business. - Tell me. - Leave me alone. Tell me, yes or no? - Will you sleep at home? - Jesus, just piss off. Don't you see, she doesn't care. What's wrong, man? She doesn't care about anything. She leaves me alone at home. Sir, will you give me some water? - Totonel, how are you doing, kid? - Fine. I haven't seen one of your uncles lately. Is he sick? Ilie? He's in jail. They took him. - Why was he arrested? - No clue. We were asleep, it was seven in the morning. They came, broke down the door and pounced on us. Oh my. I have to go now. Good job, Totonel. Give me that water, man. Here, man. There's plenty for everyone. Give me that water, fucker. What's your problem, freak? You my life, you my life. I've seen bitter days... Uncle Sile, do you want some boiled egg? Sile? - Where is your father? - He's abroad. - How old is he? - No clue. - What's his name? - Cheetah. - What? - Cheetah. Be quiet. Can you be quiet for a bit? No shouting, jumping or other tricks. Why the long faces? We're excited. The first thing we'll learn is facial expression. I want everybody to pull faces as I count. 1, 2, 3, 4. Grin. 5, 6, 7, 8. One, two... Now raise your arm. When I go to your left, I move my heels and my arm. Listen to how this sounds. Dad. Dad. Open the door for me. Pull up the chair. I'll give you both something to eat. Barack Obama will make a statement about Osama Bin Laden's death. - But where is your sister, boy? - No clue. Does she have anything to eat? - Who gives her food? - Herself. - Who? - She does. Does she? Highlight the numbers that end with one of these digits. Does 137 end on an even digit? - 137? - Yes. - No, it doesn't. - Then it's not an even number. - What about 138? - No. And what about this 8? You said only... No, I said 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. I told you five times, Andreea. If you don't pay attention, please leave. Because here you too have to make an effort. - Can you look at me? - Yes, go ahead. Do you want to do this exercise? I do, otherwise I wouldn't have come to the club. Please, look at me. Do you want to continue? I do, but explain so I understand better. Choose a word on the page and show it to me. I don't know what a word is. Word? I see. A written word is made up of letters. For instance, what you wrote here is a word and it consists of letters. - Can you show me the letters? - These are letters. - Yes, and what are these? - Digits. Yes. Well done. So you wrote a word, which is made out of letters. You use words when you speak and when you write. Yes. Listen and don't start dancing until I turn it off. Totonel. Will you pay attention? If we all clap at 2, 4, why are you clapping at 5, 7, against us? I want to hear the same beat from everybody. Come on. Can't you hear them clap? Stop. Totonel. Clap at the same time as everyone else. Otherwise it sounds wrong. Why are you all talking? I was talking to Totonel. Respect. I'll say 'respect' until you hate it. Every one of you needs the others. Like you need a mum and dad you also need your mates. Like you all need food or sleep, you need this team in order to succeed. I want to create a team, not a kids' gang. Outside you can be a gang. Here you have to be a team. Otherwise, we'll stop working. One last time. One last time. Can't you hear? Clap your hands. Sile? Does it say "sport" here, man? Don't rip it, man. You there... Give it to me you idiot, you retard. It says "sport" here, right? Giani...? Giani...? Does it say "sport" here? - Dude, did someone die around here? - Yes, a guy next door. - Was it Marcel? - Yes. Look what Totonel is playing with. Totonel, what are you playing with? Bitch, I thought you'd never get out. I knew they'd let me go. You knew you'd get out without confessing? I knew. Will you start doing drugs again? Blue is the night... Come to school with me and sign up, OK? Yes, I swear on mum's life. - Welcome back, Ana. - Cheers. - Sile... - Stop shouting. How did you get out, Ana? Look at him. Stop crying. Get off me. I won't do drugs anymore. I swear no junkie will enter this house again. It's over. I missed you. You lost weight. Stop crying now. - Now you'll stay home with me. - Yes. I'll keep you by my side. - Ana, did they release you for good? - Yes. - I'll take care of you now. - What? - I'll take care of you. - Of me? Why did you lose weight? I eat what I can. I'll throw out all the junk and clean up this place. Tomorrow we'll do the cleaning. Now it's late. Use the other egg, too. Yo, I'll be at the park. - Hands off, Ana - I'm leaving now. - Hello. - How are you? - Look at you... - I got released. Bravo. I'm happy to see you. Is miss Ionela here? - Did you put some weight on? - Yes. - Do you still take drugs? - No. - Really? - I swear. Will you stay with us at the club today? - Yes, I'll just go and change. - And then you'll come back? OK, go. Ana, what are your plans for the future? I want to work. Would you like to do a training course? - As a waitress or a cook? - Yes, a cook. - I'm being serious. - Yes. - Do you want me to arrange it? - Yes - What's your educational level? - Fifth grade. Hi Mădălina, is that you? Nicu here. Put me through to the training department. Georgiana or Mihaela. Give me a 37. - Whose turn is it? - Mine. I need a 36. These will fit me, Miss. That's better. Six. Look. That's how your arms go up. On six all arms have to go up. Five, six. Florin, change places with Totonel. You're not awake. Look at Totonel. Step by step to the front line. Three, four, five. What training course do you want to do? Cooking. - What about manicure, pedicure? - It's gross. Really? Hello. Good morning. How are you, girls? - This is Ana. - Take a seat, Ana. So, if we manage to enroll her now for a course... ...she's half saved... ...from drugs... and also from jail. Do you have a family doctor? No. Do you know if you have any health problems? - No. - No diseases at all? No, I just talk to myself sometimes. That's normal, don't worry. Now, write down your name. - How old are you? - Seventeen. As you are underage, we need one of your parents to be present. My mom's in jail. I see. And your father? He doesn't care about me. To take this course you need a parent's consent, OK? Oh bitter life, look what you're doing to me. The bear fell from the moon. It's your turn, Toto. Man down. That's not allowed. You're it. Get the fuck off my sheets. I'll beat you up, get off the bed. You think I'm playing around with you? Stop pinching me. - Keep your dirty feet off me. - Stop pinching me. Stick your feet in there. - Wash the other one, too. - Wait, let me wash this one first. Will you tell me why you're crying? I feel like crying when I think about... About whom? About Ana? About Ana and what's in our house. Andreea, don't aim to change what happens in that house, you won't stand a chance. But people make reproaches. What people? - My girlfriends. - What business is it of theirs? I stayed at their places and they tell me... I see, they mind if you stay with them again? Look, we discussed your case... ...and we want you to stay at the orphanage. You and Totonel. Do you want this? I don't know. Think about it. You have to have a place to sleep. The rest of your time you can spend here. You can do your homework and stay with me until I leave in the evening. It's important to have a place to sleep. That's all. Stop crying, Andreea. It won't solve anything. Are you feeling sorry for yourself? You shouldn't be. I already told you yesterday. Be strong, and be stubborn and don't ever step back. That's how our life works. - Do you understand? - I do. Stop crying now. We'll find a solution. Enough. Will you give me a hug? Oh God. My beautiful girl. Sometimes people say that I'm complaining. That I pity myself, but that's not true. I just feel the need to talk about my troubles. To talk about what I've been through. When I was little, I was in an orphanage and nobody cared. Mother wanted to leave me and my sister there for good. It was very hard... that she left me there. My uncle fought with her to take us back home. Because she didn't want to take us home anymore. Date of birth... Day, month, year. October 20th. And your year. 19... 96 it should be. I'm fourteen years old, Miss. 199... I don't really know. Here you write: "Please approve my registration for the day and night shelter for homeless children". "I declare that I will respect the house rules". Let's find a thing like this and play. Why did your mum leave you here? Because she's homeless. They kicked her out and grandfather died. - So she brought you here? - Yes. Mummy sleeps on the staircase now. It's me and this little one. We were five kids. If we count the one who was... bought, we're eight. What? Somebody bought a child? No. Sold a child. - Who sold a child? - Dad. - Do you like it here, Totonel? - No. - Why not? - I just don't. They tell me off... If they didn't, would you like it here? No. - Why not? - Because. Will you cut it out? I'm serious, Totonel. Yes. Yes what? - Totonel. - Yeah... I feel like laughing. I'm serious, answer. I know, Andreea. We should have stayed home. Let's go back home. I'll beat you up. I'm asking if you like it here. Andreea, can you rewind to where I'm cross-eyed? Totonel, cut it out. OK. That's all. There. I told you to cut it out. Mmm, it's so tasty. The milk for today is almost finished. - Toto, did Andreea have breakfast? - No. Mica, when will the rash on your arms heal? - What? - Forget it. When mum comes for me. What a fool. After discussing with your teacher and with the sponsors of this class we've decided that everyone will practise on Tuesdays but on Thursdays only the people selected for upcoming shows or competitions will practice. Today we'll practice with everyone, and next time only with the ones I'll call out now. - OK? - Yes. Those in the Thursday class are: Andrei. - Adi. - Thank you, Sir. Edi. - Mădă. - Thank you. So... Toto. Why isn't Toto listed as present? - Weren't you here from the beginning, Toto? - No. - Robert. - Thank you. That's all for now. Miss Andreea, you have to try harder. Andreea always wanted to practice more, but she has to learn that she needs to work harder. OK? Totonel. I'll ask if you may take a shower. Don't give me that dress, I won't wear it. Now you're turning up your nose, Ana? OK. Stay here, I have to comb your hair. Hi. Hello. - I'll buy you something nice, kid. - For me? Mother's name. Andreea, Ana knows your father's name. - That's her father. Of course she does. - You don't have the same father? We do, but I don't care to know his name. You have to know it, Andreea, because forms require both mother's and father's names. - It's not obligatory. - Yes, it is. Miss, I want to go home and get my nail polish. You don't need nail polish here. You're not allowed outside until tomorrow or the day after. Stay here, see what it's like. Can anyone bring you clothes from home? No, there is no one. I could let you go home, but how can I be sure you won't go home, meet the others and start using again? I give you my word, I'll come back. Take care. Give me a pair of jeans. Hurry up, girl, go. Will you let her go home by herself? Hurry up, I won't wait for you. Andreea, use the gate when you're dressed like that. I'm taking this way. Tell us, Andreea. - How old are you today? - 15. She brought candy for everybody. Let's sing "Happy Birthday", and write our birthday wishes on the card. Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday, Andreea. Happy birthday. Siblings for siblings. Yeah right, he doesn't even hug me properly. Happy birthday. Let me kiss your other cheek, too. Happy Birthday Andreea. Dear mom, We are well. Don't worry about us. Ana doesn't want to come to the shelter. Me and Toto are doing well there. Right there. Bravo. Play with your arms. Wider. Wider, wider. You're fine. Practice this more. You start with big moves. You go body, wave. That's it, play with your feet, wave, hands again... Chest. Good, that's it. Play with the audience. Here are the jury members from Italy, Denmark and the USA. Popping? Later. The last dancer for the popping junior finals. Number 227. Well done, you. See, you could do it. Did you enjoy it? Good evening, Oradea! Good evening, Romania. Hip Hop International, make some noise! Here are the winners. We start with popping junior. Third place Dumitrescu Alexandru. Second place in popping junior goes to Toto, team B4T. Well done, kid. Well done, kid. You're a born champion, you hear me? A born champion, you're the best. Don't you forget it, not for a second. - I want some sweets. - No, they're bad for your health. Why do you love me? - Why do you love me? - Ouch! Why did you pinch me? Why do you love me? Totonel. Why do you love me? I love you because you are my beautiful sister. But why do you love me? Because you have big lips. Not true. I have a small mouth. Let's see. Lips, lips, lips... Tell me. Lip, lips, lipsies. What about Ana? Do you still love her? - No. - Why not? Because I don't love her. - But why? - 'Cause I don't want to. That's a different thing. Isn't she still your sister? Not anymore. - Sure? - Yes. You know you need to wash your feet? - Why? - What a question. I washed them, fool. - Are you sure? - Yes. - What did you say? - No, that's it, delete this one. I'm just joking with you, chill. - Do you miss mum? - Yes, I miss mum. And don't you intend to get out of this filthy mess? - I do, but you know what? - Then why don't you quit drugs? Will you back the fuck off, screwball? You abandoned mum, you crazy bitch. Got it? I didn't abandon mum. Got that? Don't lay into me. Everybody picks on me because I have lots of money and I won't throw myself away. Got it? I don't wear fake nails. There is dirt under my nails. So don't you worry. But if you'd quit drugs you'd get out of this filthy mess. You could leave this place and do something with your life. You just don't want to. Don't you worry, you idiot. You two ran away and left me in this mess. None of you came to bring me a bite to eat. "Here, sis have some meat", or anything... Nobody, nothing. I waited here and cried my heart out. But we didn't leave you behind, we... Yeah, right, you didn't. You slept at Jasmin's place, at Gina's and other places. That light is killing me. We left because we couldn't live like this anymore. That's why we left. If we had at least running water... Didn't I clean the house? Didn't I? If we had water or a clean house I would have stayed. We could have cleaned together. I stopped cleaning out of fear, idiot. There were too many junkies coming in here. So I didn't want to bother anyone. I just left it like this. And do you like living in this mess? Yes, I'll live like this until I'm the last one here. - You're shooting up... - Not anymore, bitch. - I saw you with the syringe. - Did you? So what? If I like I shoot and if not I can leave it. See, it all depends on you. Leave me alone, you nutcase. You want to cut my wings. Look, she keeps talking so she can steal my stuff. What a thief you are. No chance to trick me, crazy. - Everything depends on you, Ana. - Drop it. When you got out of jail you promised to go to school, to work... None of that happened. Don't you want to go to the hospital, at least? Just leave us alone, will you. Will you bring me something to eat? Where from? Do you think I have food? If you want, come now to the shelter and wash yourself. I washed myself, girl, don't you worry. Are you crazy? I washed myself. I don't need to be washed by anybody. Nobody ever scrubbed my back, my hands or feet. Got it? - I didn't mean that. - Just leave me alone. You couldn't even bring me a pair of shoes. I gave you those you're wearing, Ana. I don't have any shoes other than what I'm wearing. - I only have these shoes, Ana. - Leave me alone. I will if that's what you want. So we are both dirt poor. Why don't you go and stay with that girl in Rahova. Why live with others when I have my own house? Are you fucking crazy? I have my own house. - I will clean it. - And... Just stop and leave me the fuck alone. It smells so nice of cooking. Ana Maria. When did you start doing drugs, dear? I was 13. First I smoked, then snorted, then started shooting up. - Heroin, right? - Yes. So... your test results came back and unfortunately you are HIV positive. Based on your immunity level we'll decide what to do. How are you, Andreea? Are you hungry? What's wrong? Are you crying? No, thanks. Wait a moment. Look. It's wind, see? Do you have the guts to walk down there? It's salty. Toto. This feels great. Petre Siminica, convicted 7 years for dealing and using drugs. Imprisonment started on 30.01.2007, due on 29.01.2014. She has served 1881 days. This is her third parole commission. - Do you have children? - Three. - Of age or minors? - Minors. Who took care of them during this time? My brothers. Did they come to visit? Not recently. I haven't had a visit in over a year. - Do you have a home to return to? - Yes. - Any other questions? - No. Wait for the decision. I've been waiting for this moment like air. To breathe it in, you know? To go home and take my children, to be with them in my home. Understand what I'm trying to explain. The orphanage won't allow us to leave just like that. You have to give some guarantees. Let me try to make myself understood. You must be able to feed us. You have to have some income... You think I lived off drugs all my life? I didn't always sell drugs. For whom did I take the risk? For whom did I go to jail? I live for you and nobody else. Without you, I would have killed myself in jail. I don't live for anybody else. Not for my brothers, my sister or any man. And no one can take you away from me. Look, this orphan is ignoring me completely. Hey, scruffy kid. Let him be. The orphan will get used to you. I cried every night for him. If your mother was in jail and... My mum did go to jail. And my father, too. Two of my brothers and my sister as well. Only one brother didn't go yet. We all went to prison. And if she stayed six years in jail. It's hard to get used to her being back home. I've been told I have to rehabilitate. One month postponement for not doing that. Another month because I did "business". Three months for not taking part in activities. - Yes. - You see? So now I'm rehabilitated. I'm going to the toilet. You won't hear the muster call there. Do you need tissues? Let me lay you down. No. Leave me alone. - Come to my arms. - Let go. I don't want to. God help me! - Come to my arms. - No. Why don't you want to? Lie down there, she'll sit next to me. No. Leave me alone. Don't you care about me? Don't you love me anymore? No.
