What's the ruckus all about? I warn you, whoever awakens me, takes his life in his hands. Dickons! A pay to show themselves, no doubt! Just like you said, your darkness. It's perfect. Yes. A perfect spot. For the carnival. Albeit from me, just headed the way of the carnival. I'll just pack a few things. Lucky for him. I never fight on less than a full night's sleep. Pain in the Bloobits Tika. Lucky for him. I never fight on less than a full night's sleep. Pain in the Bloobits either. Ahh, I can't wait to see the look on his face. Yes, yes. I give him Alouette. Morning father! Surprise! Happy birthday Pinocchio. Gee willikers I didn't know I had a birthday. Well, you've been a real, live boy for a year now. And real children have birthdays every year. Every year? That's right. And you can't have a birthday without having a party. Yay! A party! Don't worry Alouette, there's one for you too. Now. make a wish, and blow out the candle. I wish, my fairy godmother was here, so I could say thank you. If it weren't for her, I'd still be a puppet! You heard my wish! Ehh, would you like some cake? Thank you, Geppetto. I can only stay a moment. I'm proud of you, Pinocchio. Happy birthday! I made that myself! He learns everything so fast. He almost looks alive. You made him with love. And if he were alive, he'd have a loving heart. When you became a real boy Pinocchio, You were given a special gift. Freedom. Freedom is something that you earn, day by day. So don't throw it away. You have heart, and soul enough. You need them both when life is rough. But nothing works without love. So let love get your way. You are free, to go and meet, Whatever you may want to meet. But when the night surrounds you, Remember what I said. Love, is the light inside your heart! When you stumble in the dark. If you'll only let love shine. There's no deceiving, you'll find out. It's all in dealing. Love, Is the light inside your heart. It won't let life fall apart. So keep on shining. Your life, every day. And in this turning world. When I see you again I hope you still know, what makes the heart glow. Love, is the light inside your heart. Where your freedom has to start. And wherever you may be, Feel this light of love will set you free. Look for the light. Still burning bright. Oh love is the light inside your heart. Don't forget Pinocchio. If you take your freedom for granted, you might lose it. You might even become a puppet again. Who could turn me back into a puppet? I really must go now. Happy birthday! Enjoy your present! What present? Always remember: Freedom of choice, it's your greatest power. Use your freedom wisely. I didn't even get to say goodbye. There now son. I'm sure she knows. Oh my, the time! I forgot all about the mayor's box. The mayor? That's right! He's paying us 10 gold peaces. I promised to deliver it this morning. As soon as I get back, we can finish your party. I know where the mayor lives. Could I take the jewel box? Oh I don't know son. This is our most valuable order ever! Please? I promise I'll take it right to the mayor. And then come right home. Ehh, I suppose you are getting old enough to handle some responsibility. Very well, Pinocchio. Oh, boy! Now don't forget! Right to the mayor's, then right home. I promise. My friends can keep me company. And Pinocchio, I heard the carnival came to town last night. The carnival? I don't want you going anywhere near it. Those places aren't safe. But--- No buts! Now run along, as soon as you get back we'll cut the cake. Don't worry father, you can count on me. The carnival! It sure looks like fun. And just where do you think you're going? Going? I wasn't really going. I was just--- Wait a minute, who said that? You're alive? That's right. But-but--- but how? The good fairy. Same as you! I'm your birthday present. What's your name? Well, my boy, you got me, so, it only seems right that you should name me. Me? Jee willakers! Hmm, "Willakers". It's got a nice ring to it! "Willakers" it is! Bu-but--- We better get along to the mayor. You promised Geppetto. Yeah... I guess you're right. We'll just take a quick little peak at the carnivals. Stick right up dear friends. Stick right up! Everyone's a winner in Scalawag's famous three-shell game. And now, to assist me: One happy little mouse. We place the mouse under the shell, And all you have to do is keep your eye on the shell with the mouse. That's it, that's it. Keep your eye on that one little shell. A shell that can change your life. Imagine yourself whishhh, Behind the wildest vehicle. Why just yesterday, a fellow at the next county became the proud winner of a new cottage, a new wagon, and an old cow. May I go? Is right boss! couldn't agree bigger. I believe that fine gentlemen there would like to place a wager. Oh, why not. What about the rest of you? Anyone else care to place a bet? Come, come. Surely you believe in your eagle eyed friend here. Oh, dear me I gone. We stand to loose a fortune to these fine people. And which will it be? You clever champion of chance! The middle one. The middle one? Good heavens, The sky is falling! My mistake. Wasn't falling, just, sagging a bit. Now then, we shall see what's under the middle shell. Igor? Under the shell we find... Nothing! Can I change my guess? Next time, dear man. But do stay in touch. Hey, my money! Feels like an old stretch of the legs. Dare I go? Is exactly how I'm thinking. Step right up ladies and gentlemen! It's the greatest carnival that ever was. We've got frills, we've got gills. We've got the most amazing collection of talent under one tent. Step right up, step right up! Igor, I'd like to give you a flying lesson. N-nice offer. Maybe next day I do. No need to thank me. In you go! I will hear big noise. Looks like landing. Sylvester J. Scalawag at your service. You are? Dizzy, I-- I mean Pinocchio. Splendid name! Melodious, Rolles off the tongue. Is nice name. It's my colleague. I--- I better be going. Nice meeting you! Boss! wait. I wonder if you might give us a moment of your precious time... Boss! wait. I wonder if you might give us a moment of your precious time... Hey, Pinocchio! Tell these two clowns to watch where they're going. Yes yes, quite charming. Pinocchio, let's get going! Surely you have time for a quick round of cards. A C do see? Nine card no draw, I role the ball in between balls. Hey, that listen here you big fagawin, I'm not gonna sta--- Now, how about we play a game? I'm not very good at games. Oh, but you might improve! Now, how about we play a game? I'm not very good at games. Oh, but you might improve! Just a minute dear lad. Why the hurry? I have to get this jewel box to the mayor. The mayor, you say... Ohhhh, looks too good only for mayor. Is extraordinary. Perhaps, Mr. Pinocchio would do us the honor of selling us this remarkable work of art? Oh, I can't do that. The mayor's buying it. For 10 gold peaces! Is that all? Unbelievable. Is insult. It is? Pinocchio! Igor... I can see you're a shrewd businessman. Igor, it'll have to be... The pharaoh's ruby. Huhhh? The pharaoh's ruby! You remember? Ohhh, the pharaoh's ruby. But boss! It's our most pride possession! I know dear friend, I know. It's most best ruby whole world. I not let you do this thing. We'll hate us next day! I hate you day after! Say no more Igor. Gee willakers! It's a deal! Oh, no! You did what? I still can't believe it was a fake ruby... You should have known it was too good to be true. I wonder if father will ever forgive me. I'm not very good at being a real boy. Sometime I think it was easier being a puppet. Now, let's not get carried away. I've caused father enough trouble! I'm never gonna heart him again. Hi Pinocchio, I'm proud of you! I'm leaving. You're gonna do what? That way I won't make father sad anymore. Maybe I can even get a job at the carnival? Tell father I'm sorry about the jewel box. And that I love him very much. Just one minute! This is the last straw! Come one, come all! It's the final night of the carnival. Your last chance to experience the thrills of a lifetime! Our star at fraction is about to begin in the main tent! And now, ladies and gentlemen. The world's most beautiful puppet, twinkle. New York to Paris, London to Rome. Dreamers and dancers, Don't need a home. Do it, I want to go where I will. Take what I wish, and tear up the bill! Dreaming and dancing! Do what makes you happy. Life of romance, and do what makes you happy! No home to go to, no one to go to. She's beautiful! Mother's and father's get in your way. Don't let you turn the night into day. Hug you, and kiss you: nobody bo--- You think I missed them? My life's a bo. Dreaming and dancing, do what makes you happy. Life of romance, and do what makes you happy! No home to go to, no one to hold you... No one to hold you now. Poor twinkle. I don't ever want to be a puppet again. The lovely, Twinkle. And I am Puppetino! World's greatest puppet master. I'm going back home. I just wish you could come too. Hey! Hey you! Me? You look a lot like a puppet I saw once. Name was Pistachio. That's Pinocchio. And I'm not a puppet anymore. My fairy godmother turned me into a real boy. Oh, your fairy godmother, eh? Come here. Oh, uh uh, I better be going. Pinocchio Oh, leaving so soon. What a shame. Twinkle was hoping you might dance with her. You look like a very talented young boy. You have all the makings of a big star. Well, maybe just a--- little star. Everyone will want to be your friend. It's a wonderful life. Well, I might consider being a star. Of course: you'd have to be able to sing, And act. Singing, acting. No problem. My main thing is dancing. I really am a pretty fair dancer. I bet you are. I have a feeling that you and twinkle are really gonna hit it off. Why don't you show the little lady a couple of steps my boy? Well, I suppose I might. Oh, no! Wait, I want to stop, Please! You'll stop when I want you to. Just like the rest of my puppets. Help! Oh please, please don't! I didn't know that I--- And you'll be coming with us! I guess I showed that basket who's boss! Now how on earth am I gonna rescue that foolish boy. Oh my gosh! You eight legged catarrhal! Unhang me, at once, you hear? Leave him alone, you bullies! You devil! It doesn't come off! Not a bad move for a mere worm. Hey! I'm not a worm, I'm a glowbug. Well, then, what's the difference? I said... Carry on, old chap! My word. I hope I didn't hurt him too badly. Next time, I won't take you off so easily! Your reputation? Grumblebee's the name. Leftonotch Grumblebee. Of the RAD RAD? Hey! Maybe you could give me a lift to the carnival? The carnival? Are you mad? I wouldn't set wings there. It's dangerous. I'll take you to the woods, near the carnival. You can crawl from there. Oh my gosh. Pinocchio, you poor dummy! All right. A glowbug has gotta do what a glowbug has gotta do. Poor boy. If only he'd listened to his fairy godmother. Pinocchio, hey there Pinocchio! Wake up, wake up! Oh my gosh. Oh, my, gosh Man. I uhh, Pinocchio! Ummm. I know! You took your freedom for granted Pinocchio! And because you did, you lost it. Well, Oh, thank you! Thank you. Now, tell me Pinocchio, Why aren't you home in bed? Well uh see: after dinner, I went outside to empty the trash. I mean, a person really has to keep up with his chores if he wants to uh--- I turned around, and there: Coming towards me through the moon light, was uh--- Band of uh--- Pirate! They were looking for someone to capture. And I guess I was just the first person they... Oh no! Well? I'm sorry fairy godmother. I wasn't telling the truth. Ho, really? There's no telling how long you might have been Puppetino's slave. Puppetino's master will be very angry he lost you. His master? Who? I hope you never have to find out. Now remember, the gift of life is yours to take care of. Next time I might not be there. Phew, that was a close one. Here, come on! It's nearly dawn! We can still get home before Geppetto wakes up! I'm not going home. Oh my gosh. No! I'm gonna be... responsible. What are you talking about? I'm gonna get father's jewel box, back! Give me strength. Bye Twinkle. Maybe some day I can find a way to make you free too. For the last time Pinocchio. I beg of you! Go back home! Geppetto will be worried sick! Hmm, maybe your right. Huh, I knew you'd come to your senses. Why haven't you learned your lesson any--- Hey! what are you doing?! I have to find the jewel box, but you can go home and tell father not to worry. Oh, not you don't. I'm not gonna let you get yourself in trouble again. Don't worry. This time I'll be careful. Wait! Come back! Hmm, when I catch up to him I'm gonna give him a good kick in the pants. I'll give him 4 kicks in the pants. Pinocchio! Now, now Pinocchio. Let's forget about the box. Today is a new day and we're--- Pinocchio? He's gone! Oh, it's all my fault! I was too hard on him last night. Oh, poor sweet Pinocchio! I love that boy more than he'll ever know! I'm going to find him. We cheat Puppetino fair and square. He fall for old trick, take wrong shell. But you say he win and give the winn--- Puppetino is a very big man. Is true. And a very dangerous one. Also is true, that. Igor, there's an old saying in our line of work. Better to run away, and live to cheat another day. It's very poetic. Boss! Boss! It's Pinocchio! So it is. And you remember what Puppetino said. Ohh, fifty gold peaces to anybody who bring Pinocchio back to carnival. The carnival packed up and moved down river this morning. Maybe not such good idea boss. When carnival go down the river, it go to bad place... Don't be silly dear boy. Well have our gold, and be gone long before the carnival gets there. Maybe yes, maybe not. Fifty gold peaces. It's tough to argue with you, boss. Uhhh, Mr. Pinocchio! Charming girl is Twinkle. Where's my jewel box?! What can the matter be? You can't fool me. That was a fake ruby! The pharaoh's ruby? Incredible! Maybe it was fake pharaoh? Where's my jewel box?! I fear we are comrades in this fortune my young friend. No sooner had we left you, then we were set upon by a gang of thieves! They were led by a ruffian, by the name of: "Puppetino". Then you know the scowl! So you see, we are quite helpless. Unless... What, what? Tell me! Well, the carnival has already left. But perhaps if the three of us were to track it down... Yeah, that's what we'll do! Never, in all my travels, have I encountered a young man with such courage! After Pinocchio! Our fearless leader! This way? Pinocchio! Which way did you go? Oh, that foolish boy! Why does he do this to me?! I--- I said, look at me... You? And... just what were you doing in the flower, Grumblebee? It's lieutenant Grumblebee! And I had just made a brief stop. Huh, I'd say that you had one nip too many. Hmm, well. I'll best be off. Jilly Jalley. I see Willakers. Sure, sure thing Grumblebee. Uhhh, on one condition. I see Willakers. A royal flier has got more important things to do. Than to chauffeur worms about! I'm a glowbug, and you agreed to help me find Pinocchio! And so I will son. There it is! There what is? Bugsburr. Bugsburr? My home town. Home sweet home. Wow, it's a whole town! But I though we were looking for Pinocchio! Even I couldn't find him alone. We need the help of our fellow bugs! Please! We must, we must keep our heads He's nothing to fear. Where was I? Umm, on your antenna! Mr. Mayor. lieutenant Grumblebee RAD, At your service, sir. Oh, no! Don't I already have enough troubles? Ohh, my friend Willakers has a lost soldier. And he's come for your help. Help you? We can't even help ourselves. What's he talking about? No!!! It's the enemy! He said this one... misses him. My statue! Sir! How are we gonna find Pinocchio, pinned under a rock? Well um... Comforts. We must have our true comforts. Come on! This way! I want you to remember. No bug ever won a war by being lunch! Haha, if it's a punch you want, you've come to the right bee. Mayday! Mayday! We've got to save him! I'll get blown after him. This is your last warning. Hey, down here! Hey toad! What do you want with that skinny old bee when you can have a tasty marcel like me? Lucky for him, he put it down when he did. Oh, no! He's gaining on me! He'll never look for me in here! Aaaand, that takes care of the toad! But I'm afraid our friend has given his life to save You see, this enemy was no match for the Eh, I see. What is it? You old friend, Willakers. You don't mean to say... I let him down. And now he's gone! I'll really miss the old chap. He was the finest peace of wood I had ever known. What do you mean, he's a wood?! I'm just as much bug as you are! Get hold of yourself. Your alive! Of course I'm alive you big sap! You have our profoundest thanks. Don't mention it my good man. When the going gets tough The tough gets buzzy. Now, about my friend Pinocchio. Every bug is going to be looking for him. Just tell us what he looks like! Well... Uhh, he's real tall. And he, uhh... This is life truly, boss. We bought a good ship. You know Igor. I've been thinking. Maybe it's time we retired. Found a place to settle down. Home? Our very own? Once we catch up to the carnival, and tow Pinocchio over to Puppetino. We'll have enough gold to retire. Mr. Scalawag! Mr. Igor! I finished shoveling all the coal into the engine. Ay Ay, caption Pinocchio! Have you swept the deck yet? I was thinking, maybe you could sweep the deck while I fish? A noble gesture indeed. But as I said, fishing in these waters is quite hazardous. We can't risk anything happening to our leader, can we? I... guess not. That's why I thought it'd best that Igor and I Undertake the miserable and thankless task of fishing. Everyone makes sacrifice! You two are the best friends I ever had! Look, down there! Hey, hey, here this way! Bumblebee! Down here! A squirty! we think we saw your friend! He's on a boat. Thataway. Gee, thanks. Come on! It's good boss! Telling Pinocchio it's dangerous. Rather imaginative if I do say so myself. I catch fish! Me too! Igor catch big fish! Big fish catch Igor! Noooo! Pinocchio! Mr. Scalawag! Mr. Igor! Help us! Here! Quick, grab on! Are you alright? Huh, thanks to you, my dear boy! You save lives of us! Well, your my friends, aren't you? And one we found your pal here, I can get back to my duties! You know, I've been thinking. We make a pretty good team. Maybe you can help me get Pinocchio back home? Hmm, well, um Sorry about that old boy. A royal airbuzz always works alone. Well, OK. If that's how you want it. Still, I suppose you do really need me. And uh Up here! And so my, dear fellow. Igor and I were thinking that we may have been a bit hasty in our decision to pursue the carnival. Hey, come on! We'll get the jewel box! I know we can do it. The three of us. Uh, there's something I may have neglected to tell you... Here it is! It's the carnival! It's going on that big ship. Big ship mean big trouble! Igor's right, we must turn around. Not until I get that jewel box! Boss, do something! Please, you don't understand! Let go! Now look what you've done! Bullets right through ship! They're in trouble. This is where I get off! But Willakers I--- Don't worry. I can float. Pinocchio! Willakers! Did you tell father not to worry? Not to worry? Are you out of your mind?! Look! Igor think we take wrong turn. Where are we? I fear we've sailed into the empire of the night. All aboard! Huh? Would you like a ride? No! Pinocchio, you mustn't go! I'm looking for a jewel box. It came in with the carnival. Do you know where they went? Why yes, come aboard. Pinocchio, don't go! I no look! You'll take me where I want? Oh, yes. Wait for me! Hmmm, what's down the other way? Down there? Why that's the land, where dreams come true. A land where dreams come true? It's a place where children get anything they wish for. What have you always dreamed of? Fun with no rules? All the toys you want? Being a famous star? How did you know? The box you seek is in the other direction. I'll go that way. Unless of course, you'd rather go to the land where dreams come true... Could we just take a quick peak? Now just one minute, I thought we were--- I won't stay long, I promise. As you wish. Here we are. Gee willakers! Is it someones birthday? Oh, no. It's like this all the time. Here, every day is a party. This is great. Pinocchio, for the last time, I think we should--- You wait here. Not so fast! We've been expecting you, Pinocchio. You mean, I can have fun too? Oh, of course. But there's one small thing we ask in return. What's that? When you finish, you'll have to sign this little agreement. That's all? I'll do that. Now can I go have fun? Wow! Everybody come to the neon cabaret. You don't even have to pay! Dark to dawn, party on. 24 hours a day. Step right in, where have you been? Everybody comes to the neon cabaret. There ya go! Try this! What is it? Never mind what it is, just drink it. It'll make you feel great! Are you sure were supposed to? We can do whatever we want. Go ahead. Buttoms up. Even if you feel sick. Hey, that feels good! What is it? Toys! All the toys you want. Everything you wanted. Toys! All the toys you want. Everything you wanted. Everything you feeling. Everything you dreamed of! But whose are they? They could be yours if you want them! All of them? Mine? Sure! There's lots more here. Have some more of this! Gee, thanks. Thanks a lot! Twinkle! I must be seeing things. Having fun? Yeah, this is great. This is only the beginning. Wait 'til you see what's waiting for you at the next stop. The next stop? What happened, where are we? Hurry! you're on! Me? Yes, your fans are waiting. My fans? They can't wait to see you perform. Now come on, it's gotten time. We want Pinocchio. It's gonna be curtains alright. We want Pinocchio! I better not keep my fans waiting. Pinocchio, no! Hello Mr. your a star! The one and only is who you are. The moves that you make, make a million hearts break. You're a star. Yes you are. Singing dancing, such romancing. No beginner, you were born a winner. Got to know you, we're all below you! You're a star! You're the one who, came along. With just that looking, just that song. The world seems to know a real star by the glow. You're a star. So you are! Singing, dancing. Such romancing. No beginner, you were born a winner! Got to know know. We're all below you. Your a star! Pinocchio fall for tricks! We have to get him down from there. Everybody a dance. That's it. We'll dance! Boss, I know not you care. Hooray, hooray! Singing, dancing. Such romancing. No beginner, you were born a winner. Got to know you, we're all below you. You're a star! Yaow. Pinocchio? Oh, you had fun with no rules. All the toys you could ask for! Famous star! Your every dream has come true. Now, you must pay the price. Who are you? The emperor of the night. You are in my domain now. I was afraid I had lost you to your world. My world? What world is this? Priceless... He wants to know what world this is. Oh my gosh! They're all puppets. This is the world where both dreams and nightmares come true. What do you want with me anyway? You are us for the fun you wed--- Hey! You'll sign this, and you'll sign it now. But, I don't know what it says! It says that you give up your freedom to me. Forever. But, but I want my freedom. You're not like my other puppets Pinocchio. You're the only puppet in the world, who has been a real boy. That's why you're so important to the good fairy, and to me. Yes, indeed. The good fairy will be very sorry to lose you. Woh! Help! Hey! What's the big idea? Igor! Get him off my ship! I wonder if I'll ever see Pinocchio again. So you see, dear boy. The imperor gets his power from those who fall pray to their own temptations. You mean, just because I had a little fun? I'm afraid we all let our judgment be swayed by our desires... That's what the emperor counts on. Whatever I want. Every time someone gives up their freedom, The good fairy grows weak, and the emperor, grows stronger. If the only puppet ever to get his freedom were to lose it, it would be a terrible blow to the good fairy. It might even, destroy her, So, that's it! The emperor wants to use me to destroy my fairy godmother! Well, we'll just see about that! The emperor is waiting! And he's got a little surprise for you Pinocchio. Hobbs is thick as Yourshir pudding, but not half as tasty. Grublebee! Willakers Help! Get me our of here! Advance to the rear. Willakers? You came after me. Well, I thought you might be in a bit of a spot. Will you help me find the carnival ship? You want to fly through it? We don't have to fly... Ah, you milli aching. I took a drum over the royal down to the royal airs for this. Well, Pinocchio? Are you ready to sign away your freedom? I told you before. I only want my father's jewel box. The box you want, the box do you? Yes sir! Boss, he up to no good! We have to do something! Your highness, perhaps my colleague And... and I could sign in place of the boy. Silence! Of course, if you did have your heart set on Pinocchio. I'll never sign. Never! You're a brave boy, Pinocchio. So I've decided to return your box. And let you go free. Give Pinocchio what belongs to him. My jewel box! Pinocchio. Twinkle! Mr. emperor, do you think I could take twinkle, too. Very well. Oh, one more thing, Pinocchio. There's something in the box for you. It came our way just before you did. Pinocchio, are you alright? Father! What have they done to you? Please, make him big again! I'll do anything. No! If you make my father big again, and let him and all of my friends go, I'll sign. Agreed. No, Pinocchio. This is all my fault, father. I've got to make things right. And this time, not even the good fairy will be able to save you. In a few moments the transformation will be complete. You will have no will at all. Take them all to the dungeon. No, you promised! This isn't fair. Hey! Father! Get him! Pinocchio, run! Make my father big! Boss, Pinocchio lose marbles. You're darkness, shall I teach him a lesson? No, he he'll obey, they all do. Won't you, my insolent little puppet? If you're so strong and powerful, why did I have to sign? Why didn't you just make me into a puppet anyway? Only you can chose your fate. That's right. And I chose never to see you again. Pinocchio! I'm not afraid. I chose it. Us chose too. Leave us alone. We'll chose what happens to us. How dare you defy me? You have no power over us anymore! I'll give you one last chance--- Always remember, your freedom of choice. It's your greatest power. We're gonna leave this terrible place and go home where we belong. No, I took the light away! Stop him! You must be the power of my fairy godmother! Run, run! The sky is falling! He's not joke this time! Run, run! The sky is falling! He's not joke this time! You, run, you coward. There's the ship! What's all the commotion? We've got to get inside! Hold on to this cork! We've got to find a way to open the door! I know, I'll lie! No, he's not good. Not where get me and boss. None of this was my fault. I was--- I was taking out the trash, when these pirate came. And, they took me to this island Where there were monsters and witches and--- And then I escaped! On a giant flying... porcupine. Nowhere! You'll never find the right door! It's all over. Been nice cheating with you boss. Gee Willakers. You alright? Willakers! We gotta get outta here, this way! I won't fit! Son, try telling the truth! The truth is that I love you very much! And, and I miss my home, and I've learned my lesson. I'll do what I'm supposed to do and I'll never ever ever get tempted by anything again! At least I'll sure try not to. It worked! Jump! I... I can't! Allow me! It's OK, I gotta jump all myself! Our turn father, hang on! You destroyed my ship! But you will not escape. Your father will pay for what you've done. No, no! Put me down! Please. Don't heart him! It's me that you want. You're not going anywhere. No! Leave them alone! You would risk your own life? I, I've got to. Pinocchio don't! He's fire, your one! Uh ho, Pinocchio, Pinocchio! Oh, I'll miss you so much! Pinocchio, gave his life to save us! Now that joe snipper snapper over there has stolen his clothes! Pinocchio, is that you? Father? Oh, I love you so! I was so afraid we'd lost you! Why, it's daytime! We escaped the emperor of the night! You're big again. The emperor's magic wore off! Well done Pino Boy. You saved everyone! Pinocchio, You're not a puppet anymore! You're real! I am, I'm a real, live boy again. Poor Twinkle. If only we could have saved her too. Did someone say my name? Twinkle, you're real too! A real little girl! I'm free! What's there? Fairy godmother It was you. You fixed everything! No, it was you. You were willing to sacrifice yourself to save your father. The jewel box! Farewell Pinocchio. I don't think you'll be needing me anymore. Goodbye fairy godmother. I'll never forget you! Here, father. Pinocchio, you're the best son a father could ever ask for. And I love you very much! Well, Willakers. It looks like you won't be needing the royal airbuzz any longer. I'm sure gonna miss you. Ten hut. I hereby dub you: "Private Louse Clouse In The Royal Brownpants". Gee, I don't know what to say, Grumblebee. That's--- I know, I know. Lieutenant Grumblebee. Now, what's say we all go home? Hurray! Couldn't have said it better myself. I say--- Wait for me! I changed my mind. You have heart, and soul enough. You need them both when life is rough. But nothing works without love. So let love get your way. You are free, to go and meet, Whatever you may want to meet. But when the night surrounds you, Remember what I said. Love, is the light inside your heart! When you stumble in the dark. If you'll only let love shine. There's no deceiving, you'll find out. It's all in dealing. Love, Is the light inside your heart. It won't let life fall apart. So keep on shining. Your life, every day. And in this turning world. When I see you again I hope you still know, what makes the heart glow. Love, is the light inside your heart. Where your freedom has to start. And wherever you may be, Feel this light of love will set you free. Look for the light. Still burning bright. Oh love is the light inside your heart.
