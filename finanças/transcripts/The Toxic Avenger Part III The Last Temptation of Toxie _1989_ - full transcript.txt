Tromaville, New Jersey, 1984. Melvin Junko, a mop wielding healthclub janitor, a scrawny, skinny, weakling of a nerd fell into a misplaced barrel of toxic chemical waste. Melvin was suddenly transformed into a hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength. He became the Toxic Avenger, the first super-hero from New Jersey. The Toxic Avenger, or Toxie as he is affectionately called, went on to crush crime, beat corruption and blast chemical waste in his hometown of Tromaville. ARer cleaning up Tromaville, in 1 988, The Toxic Avenger rose from beneath rubble of retirement to challenge the evil Chairman of Apocalypse Inc. Toxie's awesome adventure took him on an outrageous journey to Japan where Toxie continued to crush crime. ln Japan, Toxie learned the spiritual discipline of Sumo wrestling. And the power, beauty and grace of Sumo made him better able to rip bad people's heads off. Now, evil has returned to Tromaville. You are about to witness what may be The Last Temptation of Toxie. l can't make up my mind. l can't make up my mind. Oy, Lionstein. What? How many times l have to tell you?

You talking to me? Hit 'em. Kick 'em. Don't touch that dial. You must die. Alright. People of Tromaville, The Toxic Avenger is back and better than ever. The Toxic Avenger's back. He's a real man. Thank you Toxie. You saved us. Yeah. But it was a rough day. Even for a hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength. What a mensch. Yes, l was a Toxic mensch. l was back fighting crime, corruption and toxic waste. But it wasn't always that way. Who would believe that iust a few short months ago l had actually joined the forces of evil. l had actually broken my oath to protect the little people of Tromaville. l, the Toxic Avenger had become a bad dude. A toxic trouble-maker. lt's a long story, so you better sit back. This is how it all began. On the surface, everything seemed terrific. Tromaville was safe, happy and prosperous. This period became known as ''The Golden Age of Tromaville.'' My mom was pretty proud of the fact that everybody in Tromaville liked me. My mom was even prouder of the fact that Claire, my non-seeing girlfriend who you remember in Toxic Avenger Part Two, was now going to be my fiancee and live with me forever in Part Three. You got any change? Mommy's little Melvin had finally grown up. Good day, Officer Lloyd. Yes, on the surface, everything seemed wonderful. But deep inside of me were swirling feelings of horrible insecurity. l was now twenty-five years old. But who was l? What was l? Yes, l had rid Tromaville of all evil, but now l had nothing to do. There weren't even any parking tickets to give out. l, the Toxic Avenger, was reduced to preventing old ladies from cheating at cards. Naughty, naughty. Or occasionally l found myself trying o get naughty children to eat their lima beans l couldn't even get that right. Oh brother. How low could a super-hero go? Claire and l were living in the same old dump. l wasn't bringing in any money as a super-hero and l became a terrible burden living off Claire's welfare check. Claire had a brilliant career going as a dental hygienist and she was making very good money. Until one day she had a tragic accident involving mouthwash rendering her blind. Hi honey, l'm home. l think l'm losing my edge, Claire. Oh, Toxie, don't say that. If only that Lavoris hadn't splashed in my eyes, l could see to help you. Aw, if l could only see. Hey! Wait a minute. l don't believe this. Wait a minute. You're gonna see. Dr. Ron Goldberg says that your sight can be restored. Dear blind person, conditions caused by retinitis pigmentosa found in association with the wide angle glaucoma may now be successfully treated due to the modifications of the argon laser. l can't believe it. l can't believe it. lt doesn't matter, Melvin. It's worth anything. This procedure has been perfected on cave bats. lt's been tested on them in labs and fiRy percent of them lived. l can't believe it. l can't believe it. Uh oh. There's a catch. Three hundred and fiRy seven thousand dollars? l actually thought l'd be able to see. Oh well. It was a nice dream, anyway. l thought at last l was going to be able to see my dear sweet Melvin. Gee...l'm not so sure you'd like what you'd see. Oh Melvin, l iust know l would. You're the nicest boy l ever met. l iust know you're handsome. What's the matter, baby? Nothing. l iust don't want to lose you. C'mon, we don't know this operation is dangerous. And besides, at that price, it's only a dream unless l win the _maville Times' Rich and Famous Sweepstakl l'm happyiust the way l am. l look at it this way, l'll never have to see uglinesss or war or poverty or pollution or the Cheverolet Nova. but it was a mess. No way. This time we're gonna get you that operation 'cause l'm gonna get that job. You're going to get a iob and l'm going to be able to see. Because of my love for Claire, l took the only job available. The most horrifying and humiliating iob known to mankind. l became a representative of the Internal Revenue Service. Hello, taxman's here. Oh. Ow. Stop it. Stop. Stop throwing things. Cut it out. Watch out. Go back home. Go back to the iungle. We got him. l tired moonlighting in the high tech world of video cassette sales, Sir, here. l got the tapes you wanted. Oy vey. God in heaven. Every time you touch the tapes, they melt. l told you a thousand times, don't touch the tapes. Look what you've done. Shmuck, you're fired. My iob changing automobile mufflers was a real bust. Let me reconnect these two little wires. Hey, what's that smell? Since Claire and l were failing in the material world, we decided to spend more time devoting ourselves to the spiritual world. Amazine grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch Like me kneel down and worship me# '' Thus endeth the lesson. l once was lost But now am found Do not be tempted by evil. The reading for today is from Mathew four, verse eight and nine, and l quote. ''The Devil taketh Jesus up to an exceedingly high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world. And the Devil sayeth unto him, 'All these things l will give thee if thou wilt l was so depressed and insecure that l began having nightmares. Phoo! Where's my deodorant? Hi guy. Hey, you do stink. But that _dorant's not going to help you. Remember m lt's Melvin, the way you used to be before you fell into that toxic waste and became a hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength. Look at ya, ya bum. Ya can't even get a job. l had a iob, even though l was a mop boy at a health spa. Look at ya. Tromaville doesn't need you anymore. l betcha can't even get it up, can ya? l betcha can't even get a woody. l could always get it up, even though l was always alone. Give me a shot at Claire. l wanna boff her. C'mon man, c'mon. Let me boff her and show you what a real man can do. Homo, wimp, geek. l oughta kill you. All these things l will give thee if thou will fall down and work for me. Look at you. You can't get a iob. You're a bum. You can't get a job. You can't get a iob. You can't get a iob. You can't get a job. Let me boff Claire. Let me boff Claire. Melvin, what is it? What is it Melvin? Oh, it was horrible. It was horrible. l couldn't stop falling. l iust kept falling and falling. l couldn't stop. Oh, poor Melvin. You're very frustrated. What can l do to relieve you, baby? Claire? Yes, Melvin? Where's my blanky? Right here, Melvin. My good news is that the newly formed five families federeation has successfully l know it always makes you feel better, Toxie. While my depression and insecurity led me to experience unbelievably realistic nightmares, they were only nightmares. But across the river, in the big city, there was a giant _orporation called Apocalypse Incorporated, and it was creating a nightmarish reality. used their drug network to sell ioactive grenades to all the third world countr Our pilot program in the North Seas is going well. We're dumping thirty tons of Well, we'll iust have to do away with them. PCB's per week. And even better, we're dumping seventy-five tons of radioactive isotopes per day in the Atlantic. An excellent record. l am pleased to report that our profits from the Above Land Subsidiary, is real good. And we are now pumping massive doses of radiation high in the sky. Of course there are still some Sierra Club sissies in Congress who are afraid of contamination up there in space. But we all know that's baloney, right? Yeah, right! l think that at this point, if there's anyone we still can't buy off. Good. Very good. Yes. Excellent. Thank you. Very impressive. for a bunch of rank amateurs! Who do you think you're talking to here? l'm going for something bigger than that. Now, ever since we Iost Tromaville to the Toxic Avenger, Apocalypse Incorporated has been treading water, going nowhere. Am l getting through to you? Is there something that's unclear? No. Good. Then it's settled then. You know what l want ladies and gentlemen. Toxic Avenger. Delendus est. From this valley they say you Ieaving. l will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile.... Claire gave me an appreciation of her most important hobby, music. And l gave her an appreciation of my favorite pass-time... video games. And she learned to play very skillfully by ear. Hey, Toxie baby. How's it hanging? See this new video game, Five Levels of Doom? lt kicks! Meanwhile at the headquarters of Apocalypse Incorporated the plot was thickening and l was to be the cornstarch. Silence! With all the evil, rotten, corrupt, despicably low people in the world, why is it so difficult for me to get some help? Well..it's because...l mean... l tried...to find Stop babbling, Malfaire! You better get the Toxic Avenger on the payroll boss. We can work with that. With some clever maneuvering, we can have this monster working on our very own payroll. Have the legal department draw up a contract. But how are you going to convince him to work with us? No beast so fierce but knows a touch of pity. He has a girlfriend, does he not? And that girl needs an eye operation, doesnt she? Yeah Two eyes coming up. As my emotional tailspins spiralled downward,these radioactive chemicals inside my body were going nuts. Finally, l decided to end it all. Perhaps Claire could pick up a few dollars by donating my body to science. But even at suicide i was a toxic flop. Oh, Melvin. How could you even think of taking your own life? l know. It's these chemicals. They've taken over my life. What am i saying? l dont have a life. l have a half-life. Whats to become of me, of us? Don't talk like that Melvin. It scares Me. Anyway, this came for you while you were gone. lt smells important. lt's probably more bad news. They probably want to repossess this dump. Here, you read it. Ok. It says, uh, you iust won the Nobel Peace Prize and the Tromaville Times' Rich And Famous Sweepstakes and they're going to give you your own Toxic Avenger TV show. What? Give me that you crazy, silly goose. Dear Out-of-Work Super-Hero. Great opportunity? salary? Benefits out of this world? What is it, Melvin? lt's a iob opportunity. They want me to represent their company and be their spokesperson. l can't believe it. Claire, this is what l've been praying for. l'm so exited. Look, l'd better jump over there right now. But Melvin, you should put on a fresh tu-tuuuuu.... Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman. The Toxic Avenger's here. And his smelly mop is dripping all over our reception area. Melvin Junko? Yes sir, That's me, sir. Right on time. And you brought your leSUMe. Uh, yes sir, right here. Health club mop boy, good. First super-hero from New Jersey, even better. Special skill, leaping relatively tall buildings with a running start and playing video games. Fantastic, very impressive. Mr. Junko, we're looking for a special person to be the spokesman for the Apocalypse Corporation. Someone with charm, charisma and a nice appearance to act as spokesman and spread the good Just what are your policies? Our policy, Mr. Junko. Giving, that's our policy. Giving to the people what they need. Fulfilling desires, Mr. Junko. That's what l've always done best.But you ask yourself, how; it's iust words, but how do you do it? By building, by growing,by taking small towns like Tromaville and revitalizingthem into thriving industrial metropolises. But l always thought Tromaville was nice the way it was. But any place can be nicer. Everything can be better. l mean, dont we all strive for more? Don't you deserve more? And i can offer you wealh and... your taste is something we can work on. Don't you deserve more? l'm a man of wealth and taste. Melvin Junko, come on up!Look out there, my boy. Let me show you your future. Ta-da. Toxic shock! No, no,no,no. No toxic shock. Just your imagination set free. Look out there, Melvin. More than you've ever dreamed of. A shining world with a Porsche in every driveway. Chicken McNuggets in every pot. And you Melvin, smack dab in the middle of it with more than you ever wished for. Loved by millions the world over. You'll be more popular than the Beatles and Elvis combined. That sounds like an awful lot on minumum wage. l didn't say minimum wage. Who said minimum wage? Did l say minimum wage? What hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength works for peanuts? Uh, none l guess. Melvy, your'e a star, bubullah. All these things l will give thee if though willfall down and work for me. Where have l heard that before? Must be some sort of flashback from that lorn Maiden concert when i was fiReen No this is no flashback. Three hundred nd fiRy-seven thousand dollars. And it's all yours. Count it, boy. Smell it. l bet a smart boy like you could put it to good use. Buy something nice for your girlfriend. Something she's had her...eye on? :ould pay for her operation! You got a deal, IV And ,uh, we'll see you, uh, on Monday. Oh, and uh, Melvin... Just sign on the dotted line, right here. Woops. Sorry the pen slipped. Welcome aboard. Yes, Mr. Chairman? Get rid of that mop. It looks like hell. Here comes mommy, Melvin. Melvin it's your mommy. l Brought your favorite snacks. Melvin, where are you? Wait a second. l'm on the bowl. l'll be right there. Just let me wipe. Darling, what's that smell? Whoo, stinks in here. Melvin, have you been eating properly? You look mighty thin to me. Mom, never mind that, mom. Look at this. l got my own business card. Your own card. Why, Mr. Melvin Junko, assistant to the chairman. Yeah mom, isn't it great! And mom, l get to make special appearences. And l get to talk to people. And l get to use all my charm iust like you taught me, mom. Oooh, it's wonderful. And l almost forgot the best part. The piece de resistance, the bank book. Your own bank book? What? Three hundred and fiRy-seven thousand dollars? Oh, l don't believe it. And mom, feel the numbers. l had them raised so Claire could feel them. Aw, you're such a darling boy. You're so sweet. Now we can get Claire that eye operation she needs. l love you mommy. l love you too darling. Oh, but Claire, l think l should stay here with you. And miss your first day at work? Oh, Melvin. It's ok. And a microwave oven for me. Aw, l'm so proud of you darling. lt's iust going to be tests today, any way. And l have the doctor and Mother Junko here. It'll be ok. Thats's right, Mr. Junko. l'll take good care of her. He's a wonderful doctor He's a member of the country club. Are you sure you want me to go, Claire? Oh, Melvin. l love you. l love you too, Claire. And l'll be back for the operation. Ladies and gentleman. You haven't waited for nothing. Soon you'll be in the presence of a real leader. And here he is. Right on time. And he's brought you a special surprise, a new employee who you all know and love. Someone you and l can trust and depend on. Someone who really knows how to clean up this town. Hi everyone. Hi mom. Now citizens, the Chairman. Hello, how ya doin'? Hi, how are ya? Hi people of Tromaville. Hi everybody.Hi mom. Hi everybody. Look, l got a job. Mayor Cigarface, people of Tromaville. Listen to me. Before you pass any quick iudgements, who are you going to listen to? A bunch of whining enviornmentalists, who claim to be so afraid of toxic waste, when we all know that waste is the natural by-product of every organic process. Or are you going to listen to me? The one who cares enough about you and your families to build you a new and better Tromaville. No. Up yours, up yours. On so noble enterprise as this, a profit there will be. Yes Ladies and gentlemen Dioxin means dollars. Chemicals are cash. Say it to yourselves. Hold it down, hold it down. Just listen. He knows what he's talking about. l know that some of you out there seem to think that chemicals are bad. l submit to you, you are chemicals. Everything is made of chemicals. And ioin me now in embracing dioxin and all her sister chemicals and everything they represent. Happiness, prosperity, life. That, people of Tromaville, is the Apocalypse way. On my first big day working for Apocalypse, l was so excited about my good fortune that l didn't notice that the Tromavillians were actually hostile to the Chairman. Had l known then what l know now about the evil excesses of capitalism lncorporated. But l didn't even read Mad Magazine, much less Forbes and the power elite, l surely would have never joined Apocalypse, or the Wall Street Journal. How was l to know that the true agenda for Apocalypse, Incorporated was to take over Tromaville and enslave its people? Let go of her. l have to admit, l did think it was strange that the Apocalypse employees in the gas masks were beating my friends senseless; and dragging away even my mother into rehabilitation camps. But the chairman said that these were the usual malcontents who turned for any cause or function; iust there to interfere with progress. And l bought it hook, line and sinker. When my new company put the children to work making agent orange and other chemicals, they told me it was a wonderful thing because all the child ren would be earning minimum wage. Besides, it would develop their small motor skill. And they would really learn their primary colors. Come on. Get up. Get up. So you think this is going to be the new home for the blind, do ya? Well, you're wrong. This is the new nerve gas dump site. Looks great. Better go check out our boy. How's he doing? Ok. Not so heavy. There you go. Be careful. One of my responsibities was to get the Tromavillian's to ioin the Apocalypse, Incorporated Self-lmprovement Seminars. l did everything l could to help these volunteers find their way to the right classrooms. That's it. Stay in line. Apocalypse, Incorporated had me doing a little bit of everything. Move it. Tear down these crummy homes. Thanks potato head. Bye bye. Why don't you nail that sign down the block. Nurse, would you dispose of this please. Of course doctor. Melvin Junko? Melvin? Yes Claire. l'm here. Doctor? l'm over here Claire, relax. Mother Junko? l'm here dear. Melvin? Yoo-hoo. Claire, nothing to be afraid of. You're going to be seeing all those wonderful things soon. Just hold very still. l don't want to poke your new eyes out with these scissors. Hold very still. l'm getting there. Just another moment. Keep your eyes closed until l tell you to open them. Open your eyes very slowly, that's it. Melvin it's too horrible. No Claire, calm down. Melvin is over there. Melvin? Melvin. Melvin, you're beautiful. Claire. You can see. You can finally See. l can see. This is the happiest day of my life. Oh Melvin. Oh, darling. No l want to see everything. So this is your big, beautiful love machine. Yes. That's one of the advantages of being a hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength. When this land-fill is created, it will be the largest chromium waste dump within a thousand miles. The Toxic Avenger is one of Apocalypse's most promising young executives. Well done, Melvin. Melvin! l made your favorite breakfast. Radioactive oatbran. Melvin. Melvin? Melvin! Your breakfast is ready, sweetie. Heey. No time babe. Anyway, l gotta do an egg with the chairman this morning! Like wow, look at this. Waste Vacuum's up three pointers. Huh? Hey, hey. Don't be so glum. Soon it's the weekend. We'll do brunch. What are you gonna do this morning, babe? Well, l thought l'd take a nice long walk... ...and go over and see the environmentalists. They want me to help them save the Tromaville bird santuary. But Melvin, what kind of talk is that? Do an egg. Do Brunch. That doesn't sound like New Jersey talk to me. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's upwardly mobile lingo, ya know? But listen, l gotta go, go, go! So, like he said, ok. S'ok? OK. So listen, l got to go. Oh. Kisses and hugs. Remember, you gotta go, go, go! Heh, hey. Yeah! Oh, l gotta check _O=11=10,02=OO=19=09,There it is. There it is! It Bye-bye. Heh, heh, heh, heh. Babe? Do an egg? Waste Vacuum? Mmm. Can you believe it? l don't know. Oh my God! Hey girls. What's up? Hey, hey. Give Me SOMe. The worst of it was poor Claire. The operation opened her eyes iust in time to see her beloved Tromaville overrun with the parasites of corporate greed and the vermin of political corruption. Huh! And l was the cause of it. C'mon over here. How much will it take to get both of you off the street? Go. What's going on here? Hey you hookers. Get out of here. Lousy pimp. Leave this young man alone. Whaddya think your doin' here! Vomit break. Vomit break. C'mon. Puke or die, you bastards. Get it up. Let's go. C'mon. Wheel out that stomach. C'mon, c'mon. Alright. Tromavillian Aaaah. Go Home, puke, come back in 20 minutes. l don't want to see anybody without puke stains. Before l knew it, l'd become a toxic yuppie on the fast track. The Tromavillians tried to put on a brave face, and made the best of their mutated environment. But what does one feed to a creature that is half frog and half duck? Worse yet, what would you call it? Listen. Listen! l don't care if she's 80. lf she doesn't have the rent at the end of the month, l want her out of there. Larry, buballah, baby! How are ya? Melvin. l want to talk to you. Can't it wait, l'm on the phone. No. Well, l gotta go. Claire's being a nudge. Ah, yes. Melvin, something's very wrong. This company you're working for, l think they're doing evil things Don't be silly. You've changed so much, lately. You seem so different. you're iust not yourself, lately. Well, yes, but...How could you badmouth apocalypse? l mean, c'mon. If it wasn't for them, you would still be stumbling around on that cane. l know, but l'd rather be blind in heavan than sighted in hell. Tromaville's being destroyed. And all you can do is listen to executapes morning, noon and night. Melvin, l think someone is trying to brainwash you. l don't have to listen to this garbage. You iust remember, l signed that contract for YOU! And l gave up my blindness to see you get involved in a plot to pollute the world!? Hah! What about all the people that counted on you to clean up evil? What about all those people in reel 9 of the first movie who stood up for you What about the messengers, Melvin? You're their hero. What about all those marvelous people out there in the dark? What about your favorite patriots, Melvin? ls life so dear, or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of slavery? l know not what course others may choose. But as for me,... Give me liberty, or give me death! l'm outta here. Just walk out the front door and turn your back on humanity. Phooey on you, toxic traitor. Boo, toxic bad guy. Pick on Donald Trump. Why don't you go out to Exxon. l felt that my whole world was caving in around me. : to my favorite place to sit and think, the iun_ Coming to this place had always comfor ted me. But now, the old cars, the headlights were staring at me. The grills were grinning and mocking Me. Oh, oh, oh, oh. $351,OOO. It's all yours. Ha, ha, ha, ha. $351,OOO for you. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Oooh, ooh, oh, ooooh. All these things.... Let me boff Claire.... We won't rescue you...Let me boff Claire. $351,OOO. Ha, Ha, Ha. $351,OOO. Ha, Ha, Ha. $351,OOO. All this can be yours!! If you will work for me! All this if you will fall down and worship me! Wait a minute! You said worship me. You said worship me! Not work for me. Where have l heard that before? All these things l will give thee if thou wilt kneel down and worship me! OH, NOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! How could l have thought l was helping Tromaville? How could l have been so deluded? Oh, l can't believe it. Claire was right. What've l done? Have l sold my soul? What've l become? l'm evil. What can l say to make it up to her? Can't believe it. Claire, Claire, Claire, Claire. Wake up. Wake up. Melvin, what's wrong? You're shaking. Don't worry. l'll be alright. l think your eye operation has helped me to see. You were right. Apocalypse is evil. They do horrible things. l've got to stand up and fight them. But how? How are you going to do that? Well, the sumos taught me that when you face a formidable opponent, you must make the first move. l'm so proud of you, baby. But how will you fight apocalypse? How will l fight them? How will l fight them?! How will l fight them?!!! The old fashioned way, that's how! Oh, Melvin! Well, that's the whole, horrible, terrible truth. What a mensh! But now l was ready to make amends. Now l was ready to show the good people of Tromaville that they could look up to me once again as their very own, newly reformed, hideously deformed, super-hero. But first l had to earn their respect. As quick as my two feet would take me, l was out there giving my toxic all. The Toxic Avenger is coming. Melvin is back. The Toxic Avenger's back The Toxic Avenger's coming. Melvin, bbbbbb. Thank you for saving my dog. Toxie. Here's your doggie, good citizen. Helping to undo all the horrible wrongs committed during my descent into the Chairman's clutches. But now, l was ready to confront the evil chairman on his own turf. l would mop up the evil in Tromaville and make room for ''The Toxic Avenger Part Four!'' Aah, my new assistant. Still carrying that mop l see. Here to clean up the new headquarters? Ha, ha, ha... Here to clean 'em out! Ho, ho. It was a ioke! Melvin, Melvin, Melvin. What's wrong? l thought, uh, we were partners. You and l had a deal, hm? Toxic Avenger doesn't deal with evil. Well, well. l think our boy knows something. l think l know who you are!
