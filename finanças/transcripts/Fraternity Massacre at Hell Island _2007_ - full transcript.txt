[LIGHTNING CLAP] -Five, six, seven, eight. -My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my father's died. Land of the Pilgrim's Pride. From every mountain side let freedom ring. [APPLAUSE] -Oh you were wonderful, wonderful. Oh please, let my grandchildren be your understudies. -Listen lady, it's like we told you last night, the answer is no. We don't need any kids mustlin' in on our action. -Oh but you could help them. You could teach them about the theater. -Listen lady. Like we told you last night. Go home! SINGER: Yeah, you old bitch, this is our gig. -You're very rude and disrespectful. SINGER: Screw off, lady. -I think you should apologize for your rudeness. -And I think that you should go on home or we're going to call security. -My grandmother was a gypsy in the old country and she taught me a few of her curses. SINGER: Old country? -Astoria, Queens. Now apologize or else! -We're actors. We don't have to apologize. [LIGHTNING CLAP] -By the light of the full moon-- [BONG] -I put a curse on you! [BONG] -You will be trapped on this island for all eternity! Doing this show! Until you let four new people take your place. And, only by the light of a full moon will you be able to communicate with others! [EVIL LAUGH] -Man, talk about a wacko! -Yeah, like being stuck here for all eternity. -Come on, guys. Let's get drunk. -I've been drunk since the 3:00 show. -I've been taking Cara with plans laid out and such quick forward, like we have done and like I have thought through, when we-- -Looks good. -Prevailed and with leadership, such as ourselves and such as myself, protecting us and going forward with this campaign, we will not and have no chance of losing to any kind of-- [SCREAM] [MUSIC] -This has been like the best month of my life. I started college and I met you and pledged the frat. It's been good. -You are the best thing to happen to me in my four years here. And you're the best thing to happen to this fraternity. You could be president in a couple of years. -Do you really think so? -Uh huh. -I'm just not much of a leader. I mean, I'm not like Scotty or Jim. -Don't say that, you're a natural born leader. You're like a young Luke Skywalker, about to leave Tatooine with Obi-wan. -Oh-- you'd better get back to the freshman dorm. -Ah, do I really have to? -Your roommate might become suspicious. -Yeah. -He's a-- he's a little different. -Well, no one can know about us. -Yeah. -You better be on time tomorrow afternoon. -I will, I will. Look, is Hell not really as bad as they say it is? CLARK: Oh, it's really just one last chance for us to screw you pledges. -Well yeah, but didn't somebody go insane last year? -Johnny Brooklyn had mental problems long before Hell Night. -So where is he now? -I guess he's in the insane asylum, 100 miles from here. -God, that's crazy. Well, I know Hell Night is just a lot of fun, there's not going to be any trouble, so-- I'm not worried about it. Anyway, gotta go. -All right. Bye. -I'll see ya tomorrow. -Oh-- there will be trouble tomorrow night, my precious. But I'll protect you, my precious. I'll protect you. SARAH: So, I made us dinner reservations for tonight at 8:00. -That's good. No-- not tonight, I can't. -Why not? -It's Hell Night with the pledges. -Skip it! You know, it's time for you to grow up. -Skip it? Babe, I'm their president, they depend on me. -What about me? -Sarah, you're the most important thing in my life. I love you. -Awww, Tommy. I love you too. [PHONE RINGING] -Hold on-- Hello? No way. Are you serious? That's awesome! All right, bye. That was John. Dean Jones wants to see us in his office. -We're supposed to spend the entire morning together. -I'm sorry, babe, it's fraternity business. I can't. -I have to get you away from that fraternity. Until I do, I will always be second best. Damn those guys! -You were out late last night. -Yeah I was just out with some friends. -You were out with your fraternity friends, weren't you? -Andy, look-- Andy, I'm really sorry that they didn't pick you. You've gotta to get over it. -Yeah, yeah, but I'm a legacy, you see. My father was president 25 years ago! -So why didn't they pick you? -Eh, probably still just a little upset. My father went insane and poisoned 10 people. -Yeah, that could be a problem. -Yeah, but I'm still a legacy! What fraternity was your father in? -I told you, I was an orphan. I was raised by nuns in Kansas. -Oh. -Look, anyway I've got to get to class, but I mean you should seriously think about joining like, I don't know, a social club or an eating house or something. You apparently got talent, so-- Anyway, I'm going to head out. -Mr. Clown, we're going to be in Zeta Alpha Rho even if it kills us. SECRETARY: Dean Jones, here's your coffee. Gentlemen, would you care for some coffee? -Oh, that smells delicious, I would love-- yes, two lumps-- -They won't be staying long. -I know that tonight is your Hell Night. Don't try to deny it. And right here and right now, I say no! There will be no Zeta Alpha Rho Hell Night this year! -But dean, why? DEAN JONES: -Every year there's some crisis, some tragedy at your Hell Night. -I mean, you could hardly blame us for that. -Oh... you fraternity hoodlums ruin everything you touch! -Dean, I gotta say at this point, I don't really like your attitude. -Well, I don't care whether you like my attitude or whether you don't like it! -Oh really. He does not like my attitude. -Interesting. -Maybe you like them? -She is hot, dean. I can't say that I blame you, man. -How did you get these? -Rumor has it that you've been hooking up with cheerleaders for the last 20 years. -They're uh, they're fake! I'll deny everything. -They're fake, he's going to deny everything. DVD or DVD? -We could probably do VHS-- -Yeah we can actually yeah, that's true. We didn't know what system you're running with here so-- and there's the web site, yeah, www-- -That's gonna be hot! -So, dean, I think it's safe to say we pretty much had just about all we can take from you. -But I'm the dean of students! -You're the Zeta Monkey Boy now. -Dean, um, this year Zeta Alpha Rho is going to be playing the tune-- and you're going to be doing the dance. How do you like them bananas? -Oo oo oo oo! -You know what, we should go. -We've got things. JOHN: Yeah, we have things. You probably have things, so-- TOMMY: Check these out. JOHN: Yeah. Take care, bye. -Ah, no, not a headache again. Mother, stopped yelling at me. No, I can't do that to those fraternity bullies, no mother, not again. I'm not a coward, mother. -Thank heaven for those pills. -When did Johnny escape? -Some time after midnight. -And all the bodies are in the basement freezer, right? -Well, we have to call the police. -No! The governor has said he would pull our state funding if one more mental patient escaped. I guess I'll have to find Johnny myself. -Well, where has he gone? -I don't know. God help anyone who gets in his way. -I can't believe I'm actually going to do this. -Look, we've gone over this. It's OK. I've been doing it since our freshman year. Just relax, you're in a safe place. -I'm not you, I'm not-- Why are you wearing that hat? -Hmm? Oh, it's chilly. -What-- what if somebody sees us? OK. I mean, what if a frat brother catches us doing this together? -Listen, listen. All of our frat bothers, they've been doing this for a long time, OK? I know. Trust me. Intimately, I know this information. OK? I mean, this is going to make you, oh, how they say, more worldly, more open minded. -I wish I had some chamomile tea. -I know. Just relax your stuff. -OK, whatever you're feeling right now is OK. That's how you're supposed to feeling, just go with it. Breathe through it. It's a roller coaster ride, we're here together, it's safe. Just be good. -OK, OK. -Let's do this dirty deed. Coming to the library once in four years does not make you a geek. -OK. -Does that feel good? -Yeah. -OK. -Do you have the Donald Duck number? -Dewey decimal number? -Whatever. -I got it. -OK. All right. Quit touching me. Fratback mountain? Let's go! -My bad. TOMMY: Hey, that was great today with Dean Jones, man. That as awesome. I mean-- you were great. JOHN: No, you were great. that was so funny--like the monkey stuff you did-- -That wasn't too much? -No, no. I mean, honestly, I thought he looked like a monkey. He was like, ooo ooo ooo-- -We definitely put him in his place. He's not going to mess with us anymore. -No more. -I just thought of something I've been thinking about for awhile. Check this out. You, me, Jennifer, Aspen, skiing, Christmas. I mean-- there's loads of girls there. TOMMY: I'm there. JOHN: I mean-- or, you know, I mean, Sarah is more than welcome to come too. TOMMY: Right. Well, you know, I mean, I love Sarah. Sarah's a great girl. -Great girl. -You know, great qualities. -Great qualities. -She's hot. -She's hot. -She's attractive. -Attractive. -She's really good looking. But, I just-- -She's hot. -I don't think it's working out between us, she and I. -Really? -Yeah, I don't know. -I mean, it's kind of funny you say that because I mean-- if I can be honest, here among the great writers, you know, um-- honestly, Jennifer and I really only put up with her because of you. You know, I mean, we kind of think she's-- a bitch. No-- -You don't know the half of it, man. Let me tell ya. Dude. -Hmm? What ya got? -Can I just say this? I'm so proud of you right now. You found it! -Oh my God. -You used the Dewey Decimal system and you found it! Come on! -Let's go. Let's go. Come on. -Ah!!! -Tonight's Hell Night, isn't. -Andy, come on, man. You know I can't talk about it. -It's not fair because I'm a legacy and you're a nobody. [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Come in, please. Jack Jones! -Hello, Scotty. Hey how ya doin'? What's up, Jim? -Captain, you ready? -Yeah, give me a second, I'm almost ready. -Man, last night I scored with two cheerleaders. I'm still raw. -Man, you're a stud. -I know! Just wait till we're brothers in Zeta Alpha Rho, man. The sorority chicks will be all over us. I mean, I've been laid four times just because I'm a pledge this year, ya know? Just kinda-- -All right guys, I'm ready. Ready to go? All right. -Hey, hey Jack, Jack, Jack-- can I uh, come with you? Le me come with you. Come with you. -Andy, I'm sorry, I can't. I mean, look, let's-- let's get together tomorrow, let's go have lunch, you wanna do that? All right? Come on. All right. -Take me to Hell Night! Come on, please! Take me to Hell Night! No! Come on, man! -It's not fair, Jack! Give me fair! -Let's go. -It's not fair! -What did you say? You're right, Mr. Clown. I can be just like my father and make them all pay! Make them all pay! Pay! Pay! [EVIL LAUGH] -Of course. He's headed back to that island for revenge. -They ruin everything they touch! I cannot let Hell Night happen! Oh no. Oh no, not another headache. -No! Mother stop yelling at me. No, I can't do that! I can't do that again! [MULTIPLE OFFICE NOISES] -You're right, mother. We must make those fraternity bullies pay for what they've done. I'll take care of it. Just like the others. You'll be proud of me. -So when are you Tommy going to dinner later? -We're not. He's too busy with his fraternity brothers. -Shit, sorry. -You know, I really think his friends are turning him against me. -You know what I was thinking. Is we go out and get some pizza and maybe, like, come back here and sorta, you know, dyke out a little bit. -Thanks, but I have plans with Tommy. Really huge plans for him. -You don't know what Shelly's up to you, do you? [MUSIC] -The place is closed for the season. -My uncle, he's the night watchman. We gave him the night off. -Don't you have somewhere to be? -So, uh, I'll see you at the river bank at what, 5:00? TOMMY: Gentleman, this sky bridge is the only way off the island. -Wow, that's kinda cool, huh? ANDY: Yeah man, someone oughta shoot a movie up here. -Yeah, like a chase scene or something. TOMMY: All right listen up, unluckies. OK? Hell night is real simple, all right. All you gotta do is spend the night on the island. -OK, we put three cameras out on the island and a long list of pictures for you to get. JOHN: And don't forget, gentleman, four performers were killed after the performance, when they performed here in 1984. -And legend has it those four performers still haunt this island every full moon. -Ooooooh! -Oh! who saw Dr. Who last Saturday night? Because in that episode, Dr. Who battled these ghosts. -Roger. water's for players. Why don't you go hang out with other people and talk about Doctor Who? -May the force be with you. -And with you. His parents gave us a bunch of money for the deck out back-- -And the big screen TV. it's a color TV. -Remote. -64 inches. -Gentleman-- -All right. -Seriously, prepare yourselves.

I can just feel it. Uh, who are you? DEBBIE: Who are you? -Ah I- I'm Jeff This is Clint here. We're uh-- out here for Hell Night with our fraternity. It's kinda like our initiation. Um... Um...

I got a weird phone call from Bo. -What's going on? -It was kind of hard hear, but it sounded like he said a clown was killing people in the museum. I mean, I don't really know. -Man, it's already started, shit. -What? -The brothers, they're here. They're dickin' with us. -Of course, you're right. -We're just going to avoid the museum, all right? -Good call, let's just go that way. -Cool. -We've got a pretty cushy job. -Yeah, just suffer til midnight and shoot off these fireworks. -Did you see Sarah Beth Hawkins yesterday after cheer leading practice? -Oh yeah, in that tight red dress. -Man, you'd so good in that red dress. -Ya think? -Sure. -Ah, I've gained some weight though. -You can't tell. -Ah, you're too sweet to me. -Yeah, we have a couple hours before midnight. -Yeah. -Those nutty pledges.

I thought we were stationed at the end of the museum. -I think it's probably Roger and Sam, screwing around again. -Poor boys, dirt poor. -I don't understand why can't we just have Hell night at the country club anyway. -Oh, oh yes. Oh, we could play racquetball and get a message. -Oh and we could scare them by letting them see a place that they'll never be a part of. -Oh yes, or that they're all going to end up buying their clothes from one of those department stores with a dash in the name. -They'll probably end up working for us one day anyway. -Well that goes without saying. -True. A few of them probably will be cabana boys. -Well, the world does need it's working class. -This is true. -Go find Roger and I'll blow up the balloons. Good damn, move over. -Roger? I know you're here. Roger. Is that you, Roger? Is what Hobbits do at night, they dress up as clowns. -Ah no, no time for magic tricks tonight, thanks. OK, one Gandolf the magic trick.

Man, you know what this place needs is a ferris wheel. -W-why a ferris wheel? -Dude, there's nothing better than ferris wheel sex. -Oh, whatever. Get outta here. -I'm serious, man. Listen to this. I used to bag chicks all the time back home on the ferris wheel. -Really? -Yeah man, stuck at the top it's like a perfect place to do it. -You are such a stud. -Dude, you know what we need to do, we need some sorority chicks, you know what I mean?

All right, let's go. -All right. -Come on, dammit give me your pants. Come on. Ha! I got your pants! JOHN: I mean, it's just apples and oranges. You know, I mean, when I think of you I don't think of suave and sophisticated. TOMMY: What do mean I'm not suave and sophisticated? -All I'm saying is that, you know, you just need a little refining to make yourself better. You have that job interview coming up in the spring, I want you to get it. -Dude, I am smooth, you. All right. I'm like, like a secret agent like James Bond or what's his name, Guy Smiley. -You mean George Smiley. -Whatever! Sometimes your words, they hurt me. Dude, check out those light weights, man. They passed out. -I got ya. -Ladies, this is your 8:00 AM wake up, call. -Come on! --Wake up -What are you guys doing, come on, guys. -Hey, buddy, I'm calling a party foul. -Oh shit!

Let's go! [SCREAMING] SARAH: No!!! -(VOICEOVER): There's only one way to find out if Johnny Brooklyn has returned to the scene of the crime. Getting my master's degree in juvenile delinquent behavior sure pays off now and then. I'd better lock this back just to be safe. -Man, this time last night, two cheerleaders were having a Scotty sandwich.

Let's keep going. -But Tommy's dead. -Yeah, and that thing has killed like a dozen of our friends. -Well now is not the time to ask questions. Now is the time to sing! -Sing! Sing to the honor of you're fallen friends. -Yeah, you guys sing. -And we love those extra steps you've added. -Yeah, you're so good at this. SINGER #2: Ready? Five, six, seven, eight. Dance, back, right, front, come on, you can do it! -Smile! Smile! Perfect! Keep it goin', keep it goin'. -All right there. -Where the hell is everyone? [SCREAM] -Who did this to you? Who? -Felix. Who the hell is Felix? -She's trying to say something. -Who's Felix? -It's no one I know. Felix. Felix Brown. The only Felix I know is Felix Brown who was a senior when I was a freshman. We were roommates. Didn't get in med school. Blamed the fraternity for all his problems. Suffered a mental breakdown. Dean Jones had to call the hospital and had him taken away in a straight jacket. -When was that? -Three years ago. -Well yeah, but why would he be here now? That does make any sense. -We have got to get the hell out of here. -Yeah, but isn't gate locked? -Damn. Damn, you're right. And I don't have the key. I'll go and look for a boat or something, OK? Meet you back in an hour. -You can go with him if you want to. -I'll go with you and look for the others. -All right. Come on. -(SINGING) Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored. He has loosed the faithful light of his terrible swift sword, his truth is marching on. -Oh, we're doomed! -Look, if we're going to die, I've got something I've got to tell you. Well, it's just-- ever since I was 15, I've always wanted to-- -Stop. I already know what you're going to say. I go to the library too. I see you there all the time. -Really? -Yeah. I go almost every morning before class. I love to read. -Why didn't you say something? -Oh, I was afraid of what people might think. You know how it is. -(WHISPER) What was that? -(SINGING) My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, for thee I sing. Land where my father's died. Land of the Pilgrim's pride. From every mountainside, let freedom ring. [BOLT OF LIGHTNING] [EVIL LAUGHTER] AUDIENCE: That was great. Seriously. Great job, guys. Bravo! Bravo! -What's going on? -The gypsy curse has been lifted! -I, I don't understand. -Yeah, um, well, we were the four ghosts haunting the island. We couldn't be free until four new people performed our show. -And you did it! -Very well. -Thank you. Thank you. -We've finally back in 1984, where we belong. And we can finally rest in peace. -Its 1984? -Yeah. -OK, so this is 1984? How do we get back to 2007? -Oh, well, you see, you're kinda trapped. -What? -What do you mean, trapped? -Well, you're stuck here until you find four other suckers to do the routine and dress out in the patriotic gear. -So you tricked us? -Uh, choices people. You could've walked away at any time. -We didn't make you sing and put on those silly costumes. -We were in shock over Tommy's death. -You're also very gullible. You shouldn't trust just anyone to protect you. -And you probably should have asked a few more questions and maybe demanded a few more real answers. -We were hiding from that monster that killed like 10 of our friends, man. -And you're safe from that monster now, aren't you? -Yeah, but at what cost? -I'm going to call my parents. -It's 1984, you wanna tell the truth to somebody and you'll end up locked in a mental institution. -And you'll lose whatever chance you have to escape from the curse. -Oh and every full moon, you have another chance to find four more people to take you places. -Yeah, knows, maybe in 20 years or so you'll get someone to do it. -We're free. We can go home. -We're finally free! -This can't be happening. No way. -I can't control my hand! Me either! -Somebody help! Please help us! Five, six, seven, eight. -(SINGING) Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a pony, stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni. Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle dandy, mind the music and the steps and let the girls be handy. -Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! -OK, wait a minute, we've gotta find a phone, quick. Um, I don't even know where to look. What? What? -I think I-- I've had this the whole time. -OK, cool. [DIALING PHONE] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello? Police station. -Hello? Hello? Yeah help! There's a clown down here and he's killing everybody! -Young man, that's no way for you to talk about the governor and his health care plan. -No, no, no, you don't understand. I mean, I'm at the River Park Island and there's a person down here dressed up as a clown and he's killing all the members of my fraternity. Please, get down here, we need help now! -A killer dressed as a clown I'll send someone over to check it out. -All right, thank you, thank you. OK. They're on their way. We just-- let's hide, let's get outta here. Come on. [FERRY HORN] -Oh what hit me? I feel like Luke did when the sand people attacked him. Oh, I've got to get on the island. -Oh shit! Ah. Good thing I was a juvenile delinquent. -It's way past midnight. -I bet I have some sweet dreams about us last night. -Yeah, me too. Come on, let's go down and see what's going on. -Roger? -Jack? Where have you been all night? I-- I-- -Where'd you get the knife? -He's the killer. -This? It's fake, see? I was going to use my Dungeons and Dragons stuff to scare everyone. Somebody knocked me out last night. -Right, look, we gotta get outta here. There's someone dressed up as a clown and he's killing all the members of the fraternity and the pledges-- -Jack, that' s the oldest Hell Night trick in the book. -No, no it's true. -I'm sure Tommy and the guys are just screwing with you. -No, I'm telling you. We gotta get out of here. -There you are. I found a boat. It's a bass boat, I think, I'm not quite sure. I've seen pictures, but I've always sworn I would never set foot on anything smaller than the 30 yacht, though I'm sure sacrifices will have to be made. -Oh! -Damn. -OK, I was wrong. -These aren't the droids you're looking for. We can go about our business. -It worked! I knew I could do it! -Oh my god. -You saved us! -Jack? -Yeah? -You're gay? -Yeah, this is my boyfriend, this is Roger. -Hi. -God, every cute guy I meet is a queer! -No, whoa whoa. You can be my gal pal, why not? Yeah. -Really? -Yes, of course. -Thanks. What's the difference between a gal pal and a fag hag? -About 150 pounds. -Stop. -What's going on? -Somebody is running around killing the fraternity brothers and pledges. -Whatever. -It's no joke, look! -Go over there and look! -What were you going to do? -Did you call the police? -Yeah, we called them. -Then we should stay and wait for them. -We need to go. -No, we need to wait for the police. You know, when you're lost, you stay where you're-- -There's a dead man over there and I don't want to stay with him, so we're leaving! [POLICE RADIO SOUNDS] -All right, party's over, frat boys! Come on, wake up! Passed out. Come on, party's over, let's go! Come on, wake up! What? Oh my God! Wake up! -Hey chief, I need back up. I've got two dead guys right here on the island, send back up. I need-- Oh my God! Hey! You clown! Put the knife down now! Put it down! -(ON RADIO) Smitty? Are you there? Smitty? Smitty? Smitty? SMITTY: Put the knife down, clown! -(ON RADIO) Smitty? Smitty? What's going on? Are you there? Smitty? SMITTY: Chief, send back up! Clown, freeze! [GUNSHOT] -(ON RADIO) I'm sending back up, I'm sending back up. -Well, well. Let's just see who this killer clown really is. -(GROUP GASPING) Ah? Dean Jones? SMITTY: Well, it's the college dean! -Why did you kill all my friends? -I did it for you. -What? -I'm your father, Jack. 20 years ago, I got a cheerleader pregnant and when you were born, my mother made me give you to the nuns at the orphanage. But when you applied last spring to college, I knew it was you. My son. I was overjoyed that you were going to be my college! -But then you got mixed up with that Zeta Alpha Rho. I couldn't have that-- they're animals! I had to protect you. -I don't believe it. I don't believe it. -Well look how broad-minded I am. I didn't kill your friend, or those two. -Dad? -What mother? You're proud of me. Oh, thank you! Thank you, mother. You're taking me to the circus? Oh goody! I just love clowns! SMITTY: All right, let's get this guy outta here. I'll be back to get your statements. -Yes sir. -Does anybody have a Valium? SMITTY: I've got your statements. We'll call you if we have any more questions. The chief does not want you to come back to this island ever again. -Not a problem, sir. -Well guys, it's over. -Are you guys gay? -Yep. -I thought we were the only ones. -Come here. -You know, we could start a Zeta Alpha Rho a gay frat on campus. -Hey that's a good idea. I like that, yeah. -We can finally get some decent curtains for that rec room. -Get some nice antiques for the living room. -American flag for the flag pole. -Hey here's an idea, we could sponsor a voter registration drive this fall on campus. -That's a great idea, baby. -Thank you, thank you. -I think Jack should be our new president. -I second that. -I don't-- thank you guys, I don't even know what to say, thank you. M -Ah! I did it! I did it! I've been here the entire night! -What have you been doing? -I've been hiding in that toilet. And you know what that means? I deserve to be a brother! -Are you gay? -No. -Huddle. -You can be our token straight brother, Andy. -A token straight brother? Ah, a token straight brother! -Are you sure you're not gay? -No, no I like girls. And clowns. -I'm Debbie. -Hi Debbie. Debbie. [VOICES] [SINGING] -Hello, I'm Johnny Brooklyn and I'm running for Congress. My opponent is trying to smear me as some sort of escaped mental patient that killed three people and lived in the city part for two years eating squirrels and stray cats. Nothing could be further from the truth. Did I have stressful times in college? Of course, but who doesn't. I'd like to share my medical records with the public, but they are sealed by court order. My hands are tied. With God's help and the support of my family, I overcame all obstacles and am ready to serve you in the United States Congress. If my opponent, who spent one year in France during college wants to throw mud, let him. I choose to not stoop to Mr. Parker's level. I love America and have never left it. I will fight those who wish to make America weak and I will not bow down to the Europeans and the French. This November, please elect me, Johnny Brooklyn, to be your United States congressman. -Hello, I'm Congressman Johnny Brooklyn and I'm running for reelection.
