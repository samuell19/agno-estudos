So you claim to categorically know that there is no afterlife. I base my believes on scientific evidence over many, many years of experiments I conduct with my camera and the visual proof that my three million followers get to see every week is more than enough to disprove your theories of pooky afterlife... Three million followers, 80% of the people on this earth have faith and have belief. 80% of people on this earth have fear because of all the nonsense start as them, are people like you. You arrogant young man. You are the arrogant pompous old prick, mate and try to tell me how to do my job. Okay, now you just insult me. You are not talking issues here, you are not talking belief. And I'm a man of science and reality and realism. In which case science requires proof. You can't prove this. Now look, the only way you could irrefutable prove it, would be for yourself to die and then resurrect again and I'm sure as heaven and hell that that won't be happening will it? Wow, look at that. What do you think, kiddo? It's great. Hey, do you know how to put up a tent? How about you show me and I film you? Ha-ha, nice try. You're not getting out of this one kiddo. Uncle Frank, you're a slave driver. Yeah, yeah stop your whining. Always worth a shot. Think there are any aliens out there? Well if there are, we never wanna meet them. Why? Be's if they can find us, that means that they're super intelligent and you know what that means? What? Armageddon. Think about it. Those aliens got big guns, you've seen the movies, right? Big guns, big heads, shiny coats. Uncle Frank. Yeah. Can you prove that God doesn't exist? No one's ever proven that God does exist, so I don't see the point. And you know what else? What? No one ever will prove that God exist so don't worry about it. What about ghosts? Ghosts, where did you hear about ghost? Well, I mean I've seen lots of ghosts on YouTube. YouTube? It's like the number one hangout for fraudsters. Don't believe any of the stuff you see on there. You see now, if you believe in ghosts. Maybe I'd say that that's a ghost but I guarantee you that is a koala. None of that stuff, God, paranormal activity, it's all fake Daniel, you don't have to believe it. Are you tired? Me too. So tired. Let's go. Let's go to bed. Bed time. And don't forget to set up that camera, okay on the dash. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Check this. Baa! You scared, you warmed for the night, Buddy. Okay. There's something outside. It's nothing, Daniel. Go back to sleep. Uncle Frank. Ah for Christ sake. Fine. I'm telling you there's nothing. It's nothing. Probably just a kangaroo. But uncle Frank, I'm scared. No I don't wanna hear anymore, okay. Go back to sleep. Look. Get out. Stay here. Hey, who's there? Come on show yourself you pranksters. Daniel, get in the car. Keep still. Uncle Frank. Yeah. I wanna go home. When I find the son of a bitch that's doing this. That was a ghost. That was proof. Don't be ridiculous. Daniel, we will make a atheist out of you one day. You have nothing to worry about, okay. I'm telling you, this is just pranksters. They wanna through me off the trail okay. Yeah, all right gimme that camera. Let's have a look at the footage. What's going on? Shit, it didn't record. I did, I did. Daniel, what did I say? I did record. I pressed the button, please I promise. All right, I'm gonna set the camera here. We'll spend the night in the car and if anything happens we will see it, okay. Yeah, okay. Yellow. Frank, where are you? I need you here yesterday. What's happened? I've had a major breakthrough and I mean major. When can you be here? About three hours. Don't be late. Okay, all right. All right, orders away, let's go. Uncle Frank. Nothing Daniel, it's just bug bites. That's what happens when you camp. There's all kinds of creepy crawlies out there. Look, I've got bug bites too. All of me. Can we just get out of here? Yeah. Well, well only 30 minutes late, you're getting better. Yeah, blow me Clint. You wanna know something, you're gonna lose your job Hello man, how do you work for this loser? I don't, he takes direction from me. Keep the telling a lie. What are we doing here? Some kind of breakthrough. Hey three amigos, think you could join me inside some time this year. Ariba, ariba. Okay, everyone agree we have one healthy guinea pig. Yeah, sure. Yep. Show time. Death will occur in 10 seconds. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero decease now, decease now, decease now. Subject is deceased. Okay, so you euthanized the guinea pig. Einstein would be very proud. Okay, patience 10 minutes. Want a quickie? Seriously, Daniel. What's a quickie? You know, when you have ice cream in between your meal. Okay let's concentrate, shall we? Yep, one dead guinea pig. Resurrection will occur in 10 seconds. Okay boys, you ready? Yeah sure, let's do this... 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Resurrect now, the subject has been resurrected. One healthy guinea pig. The subject has been revived. How many times have this worked? Like eight times, I've even bought one back after an hour of death. Any side effects? None. You recon you can do this on a human? What do you think a human guinea pig? Daniel, you wanna have a go? No thanks, miss McKenna. Just kidding. No, I'm serious. What if we could actually do this on a person. Kill them and bring them back to life. We'd finally have definitive scientific proof that there is no afterlife, no God, nothing. Yeah, yeah I recon we could have a 100 000 people watching live. Hey, we can have a million watching live, this would be huge. And we will be the biggest vlog in the world, everyone would know us. I can believe this. Stop, stop I'm not gonna kill somebody. You wouldn't have to kill anyone because you would be bringing them back to life, Hello, Clint speaking. That's the point. Hey listen, I gotta go take Daniel back to his mom's place but maybe we could talk about this later at my place. Maybe. Over ice cream? You not gonna believe who just called. Who? number one target. Who? Meredith Palin. Where? Her place, tomorrow in Ralston. Why would she let us slaughter her? Who cares? Daniel, we gotta go. Baby, amazing, thank you. Come on, let's go. Bye. Hey, best not tell your mom about what happened, okay. Hey Sis. Go inside Daniel, I need to talk to your uncle. See you uncle Frank. We'll go in free next week. Yeah, cool. Hi. You were suppose to take him for the weekend. Ah, you know kids, science experience, not his kind of thing. I've got company tonight. A date? Reckon you'd get lucky? Yeah well, I would have if you kept your end of the bargain. I'll take him again soon, I promise. Baby, I wanna do it. We are. No, you're experiment. I wanna crossover to the other side. Frank, I'm not risking my career, or your life on it. Oh no wait, listen to me. I wanna die for one hour and be revived. You're kidding, right? No. Frank, don't be ridiculous. Come on Babe, think about it. Definitive, scientific proof Oh Jesus, Frank. That there is no afterlife. Are you serious? There is no God. Where you're going, come on. Hey listen, thought you were gonna stay the night. No, it's too hard to get laid here. See you later. Yeah, all right. Somebody's got to be the first. Today I'm going to interview Australia's most well known medium and spiritual TV personality. Her name is Meredith Palin. Now Meredith claims that she can speak to spirits from beyond the grave and wait for this, astral travel through astral planes. She sounds like a total cook, I can't wait to interview this one, let's bust her. So tell us Meredith, little bit about what you do and how you do it. On the other side, I can visit different dimensions such as the astral plane and other higher planes. Who do you meet when your on these other dimensions? Many different souls and beings. Oh, really? My personal favorite would have to be the lightbeings. Oh really. Yeah, they're pure form of loving angelic consciousness. How do you spelt such utter nonsense, keeping a straight face? I don't know how you do it. I don't think you're taking this seriously. Okay, you're right. I'm not taking this seriously but I'm actually very excited to be here because I love talking to mediums. I find you fascinating so I'm very impressed. How do you feel about lying to people? Question five, how do you live with yourself, taking money from gullible people? Question six, when are you going to admit that what you do is wrong? Honestly Frank, you can do better than this. Very funny, Meredith. Can I have my questions back please? Why did you camp in the Glen Davis Ghost Town? So you followed us, so much for psychic powers. You pissed off a lot of dead miners. Very disrespectful. It was you, playing hocus pocus in the middle of the night, I knew it. Now let me tell you something, lady. I bet you think that was really funny except I had my nephew with me and you scared him half to death. Frank, they wanted me to warn you. They wanted you to warn me. Are you getting this, this is fucking hilarious. Frank Benetti, you're going to listen to me right now. They wanted me to warn you. If you do your little death stunt which you're planning, you're going to bring trouble. Don't do it, do it, do it. This interview is over. Shut the cameras off, let's go. Frank. Let's go. Frank. Yeah. Our sign full immunity contracts for Clinton and I, you've gotta administer the chemicals yourself. Sure, I can do that. It's gotta be hell and we know. You're certifiably insane. But if this experiments succeeds, Whines wins. Okay, I'm recording this conversation and I wanna go on the record as having advised you against this. Happy Halloween, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight we welcome the one and only, the dead man walking, Frank Benetti. Tonight I, Frank Benetti, will tell you exactly what happens when you die.

Yeah, yeah it's good. Yes. You're sure you can bring me back, right? Haven't done it on a human before, you're the test pilot. Sarah, I really need some confidence right now. Calculations and projections say it will work. You will be revived. Okay. What's the latest Megan? Five million watching. Five million, holy shit. Megan, how're those stat coming along?

Frank Benneti is officially deceased. Death occurred at 10:01p.m. on the 31st of October. Cause, self inflicted lethal injection. In 15 seconds we will resurrect Frank Benneti from the dead. Three, two, one, zero. Resurrect now, resurrect now, resurrect now. Shouldn't this have worked by now? Yeah, well it's taking a little bit longer than the guinea pigs. Resurrection has failed, subject is still deceased. Get the defibrillator! Clear. Come on, Frank. It's not working. He's dead, he's like totally dead. Well stop stating the fucking obvious. Those papers he signed better cover us, I'm not gonna fuck in jail. Uncle Frank, please come back. Wake up, come on uncle Frank you can do it. Just come back, please you promised me it... O, my God. Subject has been revived, subject has been revived. It's working, it's finally working. Where are those lights coming from? Such a weird response. Are you getting this. Of course I'm getting this. This is fucking amazing. Welcome back stranger. How long was I gone? An hour three. Nice to see you again uncle Frank. So everyone wants to know, what did you see in afterlife? Absolutely nothing. And what did it feel like to die? I felt the chemicals going through my body and then nothing. Can I help you officers? Whose in charge here? I am. I am. Hell of a stunt you pulled off tonight. Had our switchboard in meltdown. Wasting police resources on bullshit like this and on our busiest night, not fun. I was proving a point all right and now you and I both know that there is no afterlife and there is no life after death. All those religious quacks and all those new age weirdos, they gonna go out of business, thanks to me. Can we stop with all the bullshit. We all know it's all pretend. for God's sake. Sarah has all ready told us it was a hoax. Sarah wouldn't do that. She did. Frank Benetti, we are charging you and your partner, Sarah McKenna, with public mischief. Public mischief? Wasting police resources on hoaxes like this. Do you understand your rights? Who the hell was that? No geez, we have a wild one here. Can we go get breakfast? Sarah, why did you tell them it was a hoax? If I hadn't we'd be in a lot more trouble. But don't you see that makes me look like a complete fake, a fraudster. It's over every news outlet in the world. Yeah, until they find out it's all a complete hoax according to the chief architect, Sarah McKenna. Okay, can you just let it calm down with the police, please. Then we'll show everyone the evidence. Sarah, I've been seeing things that just don't make any sense. Like hallucinations? Yeah, exactly. What do you think it means? You might get them for a couple of days. Just as the chemicals... And now you tell me. Okay, you know, I was the one who told you in the first place not to do this. You need to rest. Couple of days, you'll be good as gold. I'll come over tomorrow. Clint, slow down mate I can't understand what you're saying. All right, look I'll be over at seven p.m. tonight okay? You're on the blacklist. What, Kathryn? I'm just teaching him about science, okay. He witnessed a really important experiment last night. No more camping trips, no more science lessons, okay. Don't be like that Kathryn, okay. The kid is almost 14 years old. When are you gonna let him grow up and be a man? He's sick, he's vomiting, he's not himself. I just have one request. I really need his video footage. He's asked me to ban you from the house. Ban? And so have I. Kathryn, please I need to see his video footage. It's really important. Right, what do you got for me? All right, check this out. It's freaky, right. Do you know who that is? I don't know. As from the whole time I didn't see a single thing. And you never saw any one come in? I didn't see a single thing, no. We're all there. Locked the doors, right? Of course. Somebody is playing us. You have the power to heal. Hey Frank, Frank what's the matter? Frank! What's up, man? Nothing, nothing. Yeah, I'll catch you later. All right. You had to be scared. You know three managers before you died for me from poisoned food. This food doesn't make any more poison than any other hotel food. Gimme that. Oh no Boss, look you gotta have somebody that test the food. What you need is a guinea pig. You eat the guinea pig, I'll stick to this. Hey Boss wait, don't touch it, don't! I just wanted to take a little shot, that's all. Since my death, I've been experiencing intense paranormal activity as you can see, this is not fake this is not hallucination, this is real. What's up? Sarah, I gotta stay at your place tonight, okay. I'm on my way. What do you think? Meredith. It's obviously her. What would she got to do with it? Oh come on, think about the interview. She's a highly skilled trickster. This is more than tricks and hallucinations, Sarah. This is real, I experienced this. She is your spook, Frank. I'm telling you. Something is stalking me and I need your help. Something? You know what I mean. I'm sorry I let you do this to yourself. We need to get you help. What if we were wrong, Sarah. About everything. I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. But if something happened to me, didn't it? After I died. You can sleep on the couch. Good night. What? That's weird. What's up? Hey Clint, listen. I'm having some trouble getting into the website. Sarah asked me to change the password. Sarah asked you. Did she say why? Sarah, is the major shareholder in the company. What are you talking about, I'm the front man. There is no blog without me. You're fired. Read the new post. What new post? Clint! Hey, Clint. Sarah McKenna, your new presenter. Frank Benetti will be taking an extended leave of absence to rest and recuperate from his recent death experiment hoax. We wish him well. I, Sarah McKenna, will be your new presenter. More of the same, busting the cooks who trick you in believing in their psychic ability and paranormal activity. Unbelievable. Sarah, it's Frank. Don't hang up, Sarah. Sarah! Oh, come on. What the hell? Hello? Meredith, Meredith. I really need your help. I'm busy, I'll meet you in there. Meredith please, I really, really need your help. I will meet you in the other room. Sorry love, did you want to take those? Yes, thanks. Of course, would you like a bag? Yes, please. Life on the other side by Meredith Palin. Jesus Christ, Meredith. Can you just walk into a room like everyone else, please. Something happened to me in our last meeting. Something that I've never felt before. Well, they do say that opposites attract but don't get any ideas. No, it started when you grabbed my arm, Meredith. I have three date minimum rule and I'm into Kamasutra. No, look just stop just stop okay. Something is following me, some kind of, I don't know, entity is following me. Well, you're now under my protection as long as you're near me. First I thought it was hallucinations, I don't know quite how to explain it to you but... Come on, I'll shut the shop. Are you coming? Okay, now I'm very impressed but can we get to the point please? You and Sarah had fun. Oh and date night, very naughty, Frank. Okay, that's enough of that, just stop. Can we stick on topic please. So? Well, do you want the bad news first and then the bad news? Yeah, I love bad news. Hit me. Traveling to the astral plane with your little death stunt was a really, really bad idea. How was I suppose to know? I specifically warned you. All right, I know you did. What do you want me to do? Get on my knees and grovel? I'm here for your help Meredith. Are you gonna help me or not? You have a demonic entity embedded into your soul. Meaning? Slowly over the next few days, it's going to start spreading like an infection. It's going to poison your spirit body. Let's say I believe you, just for a second. How would I get rid of this, demonic entity? You can't, eventually there'll be no return. All right, what's the good news then? Well, as long as you're in my presence, you're protected. I hope you're joking. 24/7. Come on. Where you going? Come on I wanna see what you can do. Where? Come on, we don't have much time. What are we doing here? You'll see. I don't think we're allowed to be here. What are we doing? Pam. Who are you? I'm Meredith, this is Frank. We are here to help. Frank, come on. You have the power to heal. Pam. I thought you were gone. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, wrong room. Frank, come on. What the hell just happened here? They helped him. Thank you, thank you. Hey, hey you guys, come back here. I'm calling the police. See, I told you. That felt really good. You did a good thing today. Thanks Meredith. You're all right too. Frank Benetti, did you just say something nice about me? Come on. Starting to get through to you, Frank. So this is what a witch's house look like. I never said I was a witch. Well, it's kinda obvious. Well, then you'll be in for a real treat. Wipe your feet please. Sit. Bottoms up. What vintage is this? I hear 2013 is a pretty good year. Just drink it. Just relax, go with the flow. It's kinda weird. Frank, do you hear me. Yes. When we're in astral plane, you cannot see me, only him. You are now, at the highest plane. You have opened up a portal to the earth and let darkness in. I hope you succeed. They found a way to break through the astral plane. Who is? The demons. I need some air. Please don't do that again. You have been chosen. Chosen? By the Lightbeing. Meredith, can we just deal with facts here, please? You met a Lightbeing, fact. Yeah, and a couple of really scary demons that is scaring the hell out of me. We need to transform you into a avatar. Okay, it's time for me to go. Only then will you be clean. Meredith, you're a little too crazy for me and honestly I think you need help more than I do. But, you have zero chance without me. Save it for the cooks Meredith. Frank, when you leave my protection, they will attack you. I'll tell them you said, hi. Don't give into them. Had a hard day? You could say that. No, no! What do you want from me? You survived. What a surprise. You were right. These demons or what ever they are, they mean serious business and I can't fight them alone. Sorry, what was that first part again? I need your help. Splendid, first day of school starts now. When you died, you accessed a power of healing. Today we're gonna learn mind reading, psychokinesis and protection. Frank Benetti, what did I just say? Oh, healing? If you don't learn these, you're a dead man. Okay, all right, you're right. Do you understand? Yes, miss Palin. Let's get some fresh air. Relax and hear their voices. Like you do with me. You'll get the hang of it. You have to let go. Feel their minds. Let their thoughts reach you. Frank, here's someone here suffering. They need your help. I want you to find him. This can't be true. Why me? It's working, I can hear her. Please God, help me. Michelle, there's no easy way to tell you this. You have advanced ovarian cancer, it's terminal. I know what she's going through. Advanced ovarian cancer. It's all over. My mom had ovarian cancer. There was nothing they could do for her and she didn't make it. I'd like to help you, Michelle. Who told you? You don't need to be afraid. It's okay Michelle, let him help. It's God, check with your doctor. Okay, here we go spoon. See it clearly moving in your minds eye. Ah, I had enough! There's only 10 of those books left in the whole world. I want you to read it. Ha, I did it! I want that book in one piece or you're toast. You have the power of light, it destroys demons. Use it. Fight darkness. You have avatar power, now. Good morning, Meredith. Good morning, how was the book? So mister Benneti, do you know this book backwards, sideways and can you recite it in your sleep? All ready here. Now you're just showing off. Good read. Okay, point it at me and record. A please would be nice. Pretty please with sugar on top. All right. This is Frank Benneti. Last week I died for one hour and I can tell you categorically that there is life after death or more specifically a spiritual consciousness that lives on after death. Now, if it took a fundamentalist atheist like myself to tell you the truth, well dying for one hour was well worth it. Tune in tonight and tell your friends because I'm gonna show you something spectacular in vlog two. Well, from our persecuted to one of our best. Frank Benneti, I am so proud. Wow. It's a graduation present. Ha-ha, no way. I love it. Watch. Hey! Oh my God! Wow! Fat out! How did he do that? That's amazing. Okay ladies and gentlemen, get your phones out. Now on the count of three, I want you to answer them on speaker. Okay, one, two, three. Hey, hey folks. This is Frank Benneti. Have a nice day. What? No way, that's weird. I don't believe it. Vlog two is going out to my old subscriber list. Clint and Sarah can't stop me accessing it. How many? Millions. Impressive. Yeah, this is going global. Hey, can I ask you a personal question? Ask me no secrets and I'll tell you no lies. How did you go out with her for so long, I mean? Ooh, I think you're a little bit jealous. No, it's just what was the upside? You're defense shields are exceptional. Well, I learned from the best. Well, she's about to call you, right now. Yeah, right. To what do I owe the intense pleasure of this call? How could you, Frank? Evidence, any good scientist knows that. Thanks dude, Sarah and I are the fuck of the century. Mate, you're welcome. Glad to see you're recycling my old trash. Oh please, please. I can not handle bad porn. You know what Frank, I liked you better when you were dead. Well I'd love to sit here trading insults to you guys but I got more important work to do. So why did you call? Well Frank, I think we wanna have you on the show. Give you a guest spot. Well, what an offer? Think of the audience numbers, Frank. Well, I'm honored that you guys wanna do a hatchet job on me but I'm gonna have to respectfully decline. They will attack this time. As long as you willingly don't give them your soul, they cannot keep you. But no matter what pain, no matter what they do to you, never surrender. Remember that, Frank. Let's do it. This time we'll know. It was honestly a mistake. Ignore him, hence the ones to come. Let's go. Follow him. Daniel. I gotta say, I'm not a fan of astral travel. Two days, we've got two days until all hell breaks loose. What about that computer code, all over the screen, what did that mean? I'm not sure. I think it's being controlled by the demons. That street that Daniel was on, I know that street. It's just around the corner from Kathryn's house. We can go there. We need to go meet your nephew. It's impossible, I've been blacklisted, I can't see him. Frank, he is in serious trouble. What? It's my sister. Yeah. I need you to come to Daniel's birthday tomorrow. He's acting very strange. Strange? Yeah, he made a doll called Frank and started placing pins in it. Very strange. Then out of the blue, he demands to see you at his birthday. Hey listen, can I bring a friend along. Yes, of course. Okay, what time. Three tomorrow afternoon. We'll be there. Okay, bye. That wasn't an coincidence. Tomorrow's gonna be very interesting. Hey little buddy, happy birthday. How are you? So you believe in ghosts now, uncle Frank? This is my new friend, Meredith. Hello. Tell me what you've noticed about Daniel. Have you spoken to him? No, he's been avoiding me. Exactly, he would never do that normally. Kathryn, what's going on? You said something about dolls and pins, I don't understand. I told you all ready, I'm... I don't wanna say it again, I feel like I'm going crazy. You're not going crazy Kathryn. Based on the things I've seen the last few days, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Can uncle Frank take me camping again? I think that's a great idea. Ah, no. Charles takes you from now on. Wait a minute, who's Charles? He's my new boyfriend. Complete douchebag. New boyfriend. Kathryn, do you really think that's a good idea? How long is this been going on for? With all this stuff going on. What do you care? I care, I care about my nephew's wellbeing, that's what I care. Where is he anyway? He's in Melbourne on business. Oh, that's convenient, on the day of your son's birthday. Anyway, look who's talking. Where's Sarah? Sarah and I are no longer together, okay. Ah, I really liked her. She seems nice. Meredith is just a friend, okay. She's helping me with extra curricular project. What? Extra curricular project, sounds like fun. Don't start, Kathryn. I want uncle Frank to take me camping, bitch. Right, this is what I've been dealing with since your death stunt. Thanks a lot. Kathryn. Daniel, what are you doing? She was in my room, snooping Mom. I was looking for the bathroom. Let me show you where it is. He's just a kid. I should have been there for him. I'm so sorry Frank. Have you heard of the dark web? No. It's off limits, no search engine can index it, no law can shut it down. It's where they sell drugs, illegal pornography even slaves. Why are you telling me this? The demons have created a computer virus and planted it on the dark web. It's designed to shut down all online systems on earth. When this hits zero, the virus will spread exponentially and it will leave the dark web. Vlog three, tabernacle 101. This is going out to everybody. We don't have a lot of time. 15 hours and 15 minutes to be precise. Dark forces have breached the astral plane and are now physically on our world. They've find a portal. This occurred when I died and came back to life. They plan to take control of the internet at 12 noon tomorrow. Please, get rid of your mobile phones, laptops, computers, everything that is connected to the internet. We don't know exactly what will happen but we do know that they will take control of everything and I mean everything including all the world's nuclear arsenal. This is real. This is not fake, get ready for a fight and may light be with you. I'll post it now. Where you going? To the liquor store, I want their best red while I still can. Hold on, I'll come with you. No offense Meredith but I can take care of myself in case you haven't noticed. Frank, if you leave this tabernacle... Frank! Frank! Frank! You'll never possess my soul. The power of Satan now possesses you. Repeat after me Frank. You must do the death experiment again. Crossover, deceased. You must destroy the demons. You know, I could really miss you. How long was I gone? Way too long. Come on, I need your help. Frank, do you have any idea how hard I worked to rescue you? Trust me. Hey, what's up? Hey Clint, get your camera ready, we're on our way. It's about time, 22 Garden Boulevard, five doc. Do you mind telling me why we need to meet Sarah and Clint? Read me. Need to die again. Where's Sarah? She's on her way. Is she crazy? Chill man, she'll be here. Never thought you'd have the guts, Frank. Sarah, do you see this? Ah yes, that's a phone. This is how long we have, Sarah. Tell me that one about Goldilocks again. I'm gonna love watching your terrified face in a minute. Okay, this freak doesn't stay for the interview. We're gonna ask you nicely to retract that. Or what?
