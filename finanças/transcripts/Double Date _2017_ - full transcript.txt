You can be James fucking Bond I don't give a shit. But you gotta blag it. Once you've got them on the hook, that's when you check out. Don't stay there too long. It'll leave them gagging for it. I think I'm gonna be sick. Sick with lust obviously. All right fuck it, I tell you what, you get up there and you buy yourself a drink but make sure it's got ice in it. Get one of the icicles out and you smash it. Once you've smashed it turn to the girls and you go 'all right, girls, ' and you go, "Hola, girls. "now that I've broken the ice, can I buy you a drink?" Piece of piss off you pop. Literally no one has ever fallen for that shit. Don't listen to this fucking idiot. Works every time dude. They think they'll hate it but deep inside themselves they love it trust me. Just wait this is a lot of information to take in at once okay. So... Don't think, act.
