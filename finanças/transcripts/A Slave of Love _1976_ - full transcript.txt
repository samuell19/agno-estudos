MOSFILM Experimental Artistic Association SLAVE OF LOVE A Melodrama in Ten Parts with Olga Voznesenskaya Darling! Do you like my playing? Yes, darling, of course I do. Hey! Light! So stuffy with your breathing! Everyone present your documents! There! There he is! It will all be cleared up. It's a misunderstanding. Hello. I've come to the cinematograph. I heard about this film in Vinnitsa. I'm from Vinnitsa, from the Margolin plant. You thought I'm Margolin? No, I'm not Margolin, not the owner. You know it's because I'm nervous. They grabbed and dragged me. Try and put yourself in my place. It's a misunderstanding. Everything will be cleared up now. We'll all laugh at that mishap. I had a friend... Rumyantsev, get him in the car! Let's go. Please! You'd better watch out! Cows. SLAVE OF LOVE Written by F. GORENSHTEIN A. MIKHALKOV-KONCHALOVSKY Directed by Nikita MIKHALKOV Director of Photography Pavel LEBESHEV Production Designers: Alexander ADABASHIAN Alexander SAMULEKIN Music by E. ARTEMYEV Conductor M. NERSESYAN Song Lyrics - N. Konchalovskaya Song Performed by Ye. Kamburova English Subtitles by T. Kameneva Starring Yelena SOLOVEY as Olga Voznesenskaya Rodion NAKHAPETOV as Victor Pototsky Alexander KALYAGIN as Kalyagin Oleg BASSILASHVILI as Yuzhakov Konstantin GRIGORYEV as Fedotov All right, Olenka, face the camera. Look into it. Great. Mishenka, we need something intimate here. Good. Where's the revolver? Here it is. All right, the revolver is here. Look in the window. It's raining. Lightning. There goes lightning. Look again at the portrait. Take a deep breath. Bite your lip. Great! Now, a smile. Well, something like that. - The light's on. What do we do? - Put it out. A break? - Milk. - No, thank you. - I'll go for a smoke. - Yes, have a smoke, Mishenka. Well... It would be nice... to have a title here. I don't think we need it. - What? - I'll do it. Do it... Gentlemen! Don't you see that everything we're doing is just awful? Alexander Alexandrovich, I can no longer work without a partner. I feel ridiculous, naked. Besides, it doesn't conform to Mr. Maksakov's style. Alexander Alexandrovich, dear, I can't do it without a partner. Olenka, everything is all right. Everything is wonderful, my dear. When are they going to arrive at last, can you tell me? For how long must we wait? Hurry up, for God's sake! - Can I take a bath? - Go ahead. He grasped her with his two fingers. He grasped her at what? No, not this way! It's not delicate. Oh, I feel hungry, and I want to lose weight. I want both. Watch out! Step back! There they are. I crumpled the scenery. I'm sorry. Will you fix it, please? - We'll fix it right away. - Thank you. How's everything? - Uncle Savva is here! - Hello, my little ones. No, this is for later. Hello, everyone! How are you, Lyubov Andreyevna? Thank you. - Why aren't we shooting? - We're out of film. - What do you mean? - We ran out of film. Excuse me for a minute. What do you mean, ran out? Where did it go? You had enough to last you through tomorrow. It was made defective in laboratory. Defective? Again? I'll have its price deducted from your salary! Can the temple of your love hold out if it's built on a slave's tears? I can't even pronounce it, the words stick in my throat! Please, stop it, Olenka! Don't say that, Olenka! It's good, it's... Victor Ivanovich, you tell her. It's notjust good, it's great! Who are you to say that? Yourjob is just turning the handle right! Why are you always meddling?! Defective, my God! But I work on Sundays! Mr. Pototsky, I'm not going to say that rubbish for all the money in the world. - Why, Olga Nikolayevna? - And Maksakov wouldn't do it either. Olga Nikolayevna, what do you mean? We've agreed on everything. - And the director, Mister... - Kalyagin. Kalyagin. Alexander Alexandrovich? He promised to make it sound warm and humane. We'll warm it up and make humane. Veniamin Konstantinovich, my dear, if you feel exhausted, if you've lost a divine spark, then say so. But you can't keep letting me and Olga Nikolayevna down! I pay thirty rubles for a script. Not many writers get that much. Savva Yakovlevich, I'll rewrite every- thing and make it a gem. I promise. - Oh, how hot it is! - Nobody asks for your opinion! It's outrageous! So no one comes here? - No. - I see. Vyalin! Help! Anybody, help me! Oh, God! - How is Olga Nikolayevna? - She's fine, thank you. Give my warmest regards to her. Maksakov, Maksakov... But I don't know where he is. They left Moscow two weeks ago, there's been no word from them since. Maybe they got into Makhno's hands, or some... other bandits'. Yes, how well it's said about our Russian cinema. We're all beasts in the jungle, all we know is just wrangle. - How true it is. - I've never done any wrong to anybody. Sorry. And I've never wished to. And you, by the way, simply stabbed me in the back with that film. Savva Yakovlevich, I'm even glad that we don't have film stock. First, we've got nothing to film, and nobody to film for. - You start it again? - Did I say anything? I said nothing... Get out of the way! Outrageous! What are you doing?! No, we're not going to wait. We'll get the film and complete shooting. We'll replace Duchamp with Vyazemskaya. Yes, yes, I know. But I've never had an affair with her. And besides, she's beautiful. And this guy instead of Maksakov. Him? Never! Mister Kanin, with whom are you working now? Now I'm in Kazhokhirs film, but in an hour I'll start with Boim himself. What part will you play? The devil only knows. They only said I'll need a beard. That's how it is. You want to cast me? No, no, no! We're waiting for Maksakov. Oh... But if you do, don't lose time, I'm in a great demand nowadays. Well, girls, comment ca va? Everybody, we're shooting! Smoke! Camera! And with God's help, action! Good! The guard's sleeping and seeing a nightmare. Turn your head to the camera, you bald one! Good! It's raining! Mother! The goose! Good. Good. From the bushes, slowly and ominously the Janissaries are crawling out. It's scary. Oh, it's so scary. Everyone is scared! Bare your teeth! I can't see your teeth! Good! A short skirmish. Kill the captives! Stop brandishing your lance, you fool! You're blocking the way! Fall down, stupid! We're running out of film! Anyone alive there? Or should I do it myself? Fall down! Hit him! Great! Cut, ladies and gentlemen! Alexander! Mother! It pains me to look at that. They're doing real work, and we're just lolling about. He's been shooting for three days already, bastard! The film will be released any day now and we'll look awful! O Lord! Help us and save us, ruin that Oriental rubbish of theirs! Help me at least once in my life, dear God, I beg you! Alexander Alexandrovich! I've got an idea. Look, it's interesting. The Bolsheviks are in Moscow, Denikirs army is here. Petlyura's men are in between. And we're like in a childrers room. A rosy childrers room. Our life is like a house on fire, where children have been forgotten. Yes, it's true. When as a child I was afraid of something, I closed my eyes to hide. Right, but that guy never stops writing. Let's keep our eyes closed, let's keep them closed. Look, stop writing. I understood everything, I'll rewrite it and make it a gem. Let's go out and get some fresh air, and keep our eyes closed. Let's go to the fresh air, gentlemen. And come what may. Arkasha! Arkasha, where are you? I've been... I've been looking for you everywhere. What's the matter? Everyone's waiting for us. Come on, quick, my dear. Fruits, please, ladies and gentlemen. Look what our Arkasha can do! Arkasha, please show them. How charming! Girls, come here! You see how extravagant we can be with our talents? What do you want? A pear? Well, my dear, you promised to be in time. - Have you already started? - Waiting for you. Alexander Alexandrovich, you see what the south means? The grass is as dry as burnt paper. Yes, yes. Yes. Remember how we were shooting... - Near Moscow. - In Arkhangelskoye. In Arkhangelskoye. Remember the grass there? - It was in October. - Was it? October, October... October. Yes, yes, October. October... As if it were alive, smelling of mushrooms, remember? Yes... Russia's middle belt... The middle belt. And remember Marfino? In 1914? - In 1913. - Ah, yes. What was it? "War and Peace". Olga Nikolayevna was starring, remember? And the grass... You could see it under the snow. Patches of snow and the grass, it was so green. It was November. - The middle belt. - Yes, amazing! Please, stop it, Savva. Or I'm going to cry. Why do you keep eating? You need to lose weight. How can you? It's very personal. It's indelicate. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Then you shouldn't have said that. So you won't tell me where you've been? Why, fishing on the pond. From early morning? From early, early morning? Oh, what dust! On the pond. Let me do it. That fish you never caught, was it won'th our ride? We'll go tomorrow, I promise. Don't be angry. Same as usual? - I'll be in a dancing class. - All right. Kasach! Gololobov! It's me again, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome, Nikolai Nikolayevich. I've brought some wine. For God's sake, forgive my appearance. I'm on duty, you know. - Lyubov Andreyevna... - Thank you. Good afternoon. Hello. - Hello. - You look great. Put on some weight. Thank you. Olga Nikolayevna, my dear! Excuse me. I'll take a walk. This is for you. May I kiss your hand? Hello. Have you been here long? Victor Ivanovich was fishing on the pond from early morning. From early morning? A lucky man. - How was your fishing? - All right. The water's very cold. Yes, the water is cold already. - How are you? - Well, I'm on duty. For God's sake, forgive my appearance, I made 200 miles in all that dust... Two hundred miles. You see that dust? And the car... I think I'd better paint it beige, like yours. Dust is not so noticeable on it. - I don't know. - Yes, I'll have it repainted. By the way, the water is really cold, we shouldn't let the girls swim. Excuse me, I don't want to bother you. He was no bother. What was it you were inventing? What was it about fish? - About the water. - About the water? The water is already cold. - May I? - You're welcome. I'm sorry again about my appearance. - It's nothing. - I'm on duty, you know. Forgive me for God's sake for this tactless question. Somehow you're never alone, always with soldiers. Why? - I'm afraid. - What? Just... afraid. - You too? - Me too. You're Chief of Counterintelligence, you have nothing to be afraid of. I have nothing to be afraid of? What do you think, Victor Ivanovich? There're more conspirators than there're lamps in this city. The army is retreating on the front with cries of 'hurray'. Oh God, when are they going to be here at last? When, when will they come at last? - Well? - What? - Has there been a telegram from them? - Not yet. But we'll get it today for sure. You say that every day. Today I have a premonition. - Ivan! - Coming! Good afternoon. My friend Ivan, he's a boss here. And this is Olga Voznesenskaya. Good afternoon. I did recognize you. How are things going? Everything is all right? We're shooting. - Would you like anything else? - No, thank you. Then please excuse me. - See you tomorrow? - Yes. Victor Ivanovich! My dear! Are you listening to me? Let's run, shall we? Mommy, look! Voznesenskaya in the flesh! Mommy, hurry! Hurry, look! So many of them! Olga Nikolayevna, wait! What an interesting thought! Your last film has awakened Russian art. Audiences are raving. Olga Nikolayevna, you're a sorceress! Your "Slave of Love" has conquered all the peoples. Trample upon us, we're yours, Olga Nikolayevna! Where are you going? Wait! Please! How many fools there are in the world! You know what I thought? It's amazing that when the window is dirty, everything behind it seems dirty, too. The same thing happens in life. When you come across something unpleasant, you feel like all life is dirty. Isn't it so? And when a window is with bars, the sky behind it seems checkered. Did you ever notice? Why can't you talk seriously for a minute? Why are you like that? Like what? Come on, like what? Really, I don't know you at all. However, my dear, I've lived too many other womers lives for any man to be able to deceive me. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Well, let's go. - Where would you like to go? - I don't know. To Botanical Gardens. As you wish. I've been thinking of talking to you for a long time. About what? No, better some other time. It must be damp in Moscow now. Raining all the time. I'm sure Maksakov will come with a cold, he will be capricious, with a running nose. Do you miss him very much? I miss Moscow. So you want to go to Moscow? I do... But what will I be doing there? Starring in the movies. There's nothing there either for me or Maksakov. No more cinema there. Why? There is. Stop pestering me with your talk of Moscow. My mother... went blind sewing lace. All her life she was dreaming of going to Paris. And she's still dreaming. Let me turn the wheel! Come on, let me! Let me! Oh, it's so frightening! We're going to run into something! - Now on your own. - No, no, I won't! Do you want me to say who you are? Do you? You're a Bolshevik! You know what it means? - Tell me. - No, I won't. When I got wounded in 1914, I was put in an infirmary. One day I was told that to another ward an artillery man had been brought, the actress Voznesenskaya's husband. I wanted very much to take a look at him, but never had a chance. Yes, Vladimir was a wonderful man. He died in 1914. I know. Olga Nikolayevna, listen to me. I wanted to say it long ago, but was afraid you wouldn't understand. You want to live in a comfortable world you've been used to. But it's no more. It's been caught by the throat, in a deadly grip. You can't even imagine that! A new world is being born, a new system, a new country. You... Thousands of people die for that. And you're dying of an abominable boredom and ruin! You shouldn't live like that! I wish very much that you understand that. My dear, my wonderful, my enigmatic Victor Ivanovich, you are justjealous of Maksakov. Well, after they've come, we'll go on with our morning rides anyway. Remember that! Anyway! Anyway! Anyway... Oh God, at last! Oh, I feel so happy! Alexander Alexandrovich, my dear! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Savva dear! Savva! Ladies and gentlemen, this is my new husband, Stasik. Glad to meet you! Glad to meet you! Oh, I'm famished. My goodness, Ivan Karlovich! You brought your family! Never leave behind what's my own. Ivan Karlovich, how are you? - Welcome! Welcome! - Olga Nikolayevna. - Well, how was it? - How? Havert bathed for 10 days. How is everything there? Is it for long? I'm afraid, for good. Everything's been nationalized. - How about film stock? - What about film stock? All private owners have been dispossessed of film and chemicals. All except me. - No. - Yes! I brought 47,000 meters of film and all the chemicals. I've brought everything. Ivan Karlovich, my dear man, you've saved my life! You can't imagine what I have gone through. There was no milk for the children, I had to somehow procure bread, but I was literally sitting on the film stock, lest it was stolen. Oh God, I couldn't stand it any more! Telephone isn't working, no light. And hunger, absolute hunger! Oh, it's so wonderful! You remember my dog, Rex? We were so hungry that we ate all his oatmeal. And it took us two weeks to get here! We were kept in sidings for days. With no place to wash up. Victor Ivanovich, he is not here. I know. He stayed behind. Maksakov? Oh! He's absolutely crazy! He just kept saying: I won't abandon my motherland, I won't abandon it. Stasik! Wort abandon my motherland. I said to him, what kind of motherland is it? - What's the matter with you? - With me? What? What are you so happy about? What a character, eh? He's broken the contract. What are we going to do without him? He's a fool. Got chummy with Gorky. But Gorky used to be a tramp. But it's foolish. What is he... What is he going to do there without us? Never mind. We've got Kanin. We'll shoot him. Would you like some wine? Leave me alone! By the way, in Paris... Leave me alone! Ladies and gentlemen, I invite everybody to a buffet at my place! Goodbye, Vladimir Alexeyevich. Ladies and gentlemen, wait for me! Pause. Look at the portrait. Great. Good girl. Now turn. Good... Enters the count... Good, he enters... Zhukov, go! Good. Look around. Great! Now go for her, go for her! Push him off! Here goes the countess! Good, the countess goes... Great! Great! Very good, very good... On your knees! On your knees! - Bend back even more! - I'm uncomfortable. - Hold on! - I'm uncomfortable! Countess, breathe rapidly. Cut! How is it with you? We did it! Bravo, Alexander Alexandrovich! Congratulations! Mind your own business. Come here, boys, quick! Everything is all right, Lisa. Take everything away, boys. Hurry! - Some milk? - No, thank you. Mishenka, go have a smoke. This way, this way. Good! What are you doing here, little nymph? You're in my way. - I think it's good. - What's good? Don't you understand that it's not the truth? It's some rubbish! What truth are you talking about, Olga Nikolayevna? What's important is beauty. The rest is Maksakov's stuff. Forget it! He forgot about us, we'll forget about him. What? Who? What has Maksakov to do with it? He's empty like a drum! He's just a mannequin! I don't agree, Olenka. You see, Savva Yakovlevich? He's a very interesting artiste, and we should be grateful to him. You should be too, Olenka. Yes, my dear. That is Maksakov! Why should I be grateful to him? I was already a star when I started working with him! For your information, it's him, yes, it's him, that nonentity... - Olga Nikolayevna! - Leave me alone! It's him who should be grateful to me and... He is nobody, a two-bit actor, a nil! He's even a nonentity... I no longer can work here! And tomorrow I'm leaving for Paris! Mother! Blessed is he who visited this world at its most fateful moment... You know, my mother... Oh God, what are we doing? Who needs all that? Everything is so temporary, everything's done on the run. After all I am 28, I am a famous actress. Am I entitled to a bath at my home after work? There's been no hot water at my hotel for a week, and I never complained. It's freezing at night! I share the bed with my mother and the girls. I want a normal life! I'm going to Paris tomorrow! What Paris are you talking about? Don't try to talk me out of it! Even a child can see what's going on with you. To Paris... You should go to Moscow. Is it about Maksakov again? He's a nobody, your Maksakov! He's a nil! And don't you tell me about him! Don't you tell me that! Stop yelling! - What? - Enough. What? Do you realize who you're talking to? - Olga Nikolayevna... - Who are you? Tell me, who are you? Open the door now! Some lousy cameraman! Stop the car now! Do you hear? Stop the car! Come to your senses, ladies and gentlemen! Where are you going? What we're doing is awful! You're just wasting time! You're being deceived! Maksakov has no talent at all! And I... What I'm doing is terrible, trivial, tasteless! I've been made an idol. But I'm just a woman. Look around! It's hunger and misery all around! Ladies and gentlemen, we have Olga Voznesenskaya among us! Go onto the streets! Help starving children! So she is sitting on the stairs. A suitcase beside her, a suitcase... It's as hot as in the summer. Something prevents them from attacking. Good afternoon! Good afternoon... Something prevents them from attacking. We fixed it. How is it now? A shot. How does it look? Good? Good. That'll be my worst film. And where's Pototsky? - Where's Pototsky? - We're all waiting for him. - Care for a beer? - No. I say exotics is a great thing! That man of letters did a good job. Now we'll see, Mr. Boim, whose Turkish delight is sweeter. Why do you look so gloomy? That'll be my worst film. So what? At least we'll make money... at last. Thank God for that... Pardon me, I'm sorry... He'll take care of you. Pardon, but I'm ready. Great, but there's a hitch - we're waiting for our cameraman. Perhaps I can read the script then? No, my dear, we're surrounded by enemies. The spies steal scripts. No, my dear, you'll have to do it off the cuff. Use your talent! - What do you mean? - Just kidding. Where's Pototsky? It's time to go to Paris. I don't know. I myself have been waiting for him since morning. You know, I used to have a pleasant baritone. But then I got a cold. So I've come to cinema... What do you think you're doing, Mr. Pototsky? Everyone take your positions! We've already lost two hours as it is! Little nymph! Victor Ivanovich. My dear, I think you're somewhat... Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Alexander Alexandrovich! Pototsky's absolutely drunk. I've never seen him like this. Just look at him! Sneaking slowly. Great! There goes the car! Get out of the car, quick! The shot! Fall down, both of you! Good. The gun. On your knees, embrace. Goo... Cut! Cut! For God's sake, when will be the end of all this? When are you going to stop that... Stop laughing! Sorry, I'm on duty. - But you can't do it. - I'll explain everything later. What's going on, really? Something's happening here all the time. You look great, Lyoshka... - They wanted to make me a beard... - A real Turk! I refused, it's better to be with my own face. Why is the cameraman squatting all the time? He's drunk. They wanted to do a nose job, too. I'll go rehearse the scene. Go ahead. Strelnikov, draw up the men! By the way... For your information, Victor Ivanovich was wounded in the war. A bullet fragment in his back since 1914. If it were not for you, I would've knocked off all that filming band. I'm paying the money, and I demand order! It's even worse than an indelicacy. I beg your pardon, of course... Today we're inspecting all the film producers. But you visit our set every day. Ouch, it hurts! This morning at dawn we had several men executed in Rogachiki. Someone illegally shot it on film. For provocational purposes, of course. We couldn't establish who it was. But an hour before that, someone saw a car there. Savva Yakovlevich, I am not accusing your group. As for you personally, I simply love you, my dear man. - I... please, understand. - But you must understand me. I understand... believe me, I always said... Ouch, it hurts! With what's going on on the fronts, the underground is stirring up here. Oh, how hot it is! Listen, Olga, only you can save me now. It's very serious, do not turn. I'm absolutely sober. Listen to me. Under the seat in my car there is a box with film. It must be taken out without anyone noticing it. Only you can do that. What? A celebrity is above suspicion. Think of something. I'm begging you! Katya! Masha! Girls, what are you doing over there in the car? How many times did I tell you you can't play in the car? Get off it! Why are you looking at me like that? I don't recognize you. - You don't recognize me? - This is Olga Voznesenskaya! Holy God! I thought it was you, but I wasrt sure. It's her! I'm thrilled! Of course, it's me. Katya, give Mister a candy. - Here, have a candy, Mister. - Thank you, little darling. - And what's this, Mister? - This is a document. Honey, take the pram away. Let's go to Grandma. I've seen all of your movies. My wife and I, we adore movies. I can name them all... "Love and the Dragons", right? "Roses in the Dust", "Daughter of the Guillotine". And... No, I'm not sure, I'd better not say it. I just... go to see them all the time. Well, pretender, come on, say something. What? What if I haven't done it? - I might have been killed. - What? You? Oh, how wonderful it is, to do something for which you can get killed... or even put in jail. Oh God! I wish I did something for which I could be put in jail! Do something important, at least important for somebody. So that... so the world turned around me! Maybe... not even being an actress. Well... maybe just a teacher, or a tree... Or I would like to be the grass, or the earth. I would like just to exist. You do. I don't. Stop the car. A truck. A truck. A truck! Soldiers, soldiers... That Captain Fedotov is a strange man, and he talks so strangely... Do you want to see what we're shooting? Me? Oh God, of course I do, only I... There will be a secret screening, but... No! I won't tell anyone. I swear! I swear by God! Good. How shall I dress? It doesn't matter, my dear. You know, I'll wear something modest, so no one would recognize me. All right? All right, Olga. So many of them. Victor Ivanovich... Kiss me. Where're you, my dream? Where're you, my dream? I'm looking forward with hope. And to me it'll come In a fragile calm A sound so tender. May it be laughter, no, May it be weeping, no, It's you, my love. Grandma, give me the teddy bear. No, give it to me! Give it back! The girls have grown so heavy. Mama! Have I grown old? Of course not! You're young and beautiful. Do you hear a dog howling? That's in the room below. They went abroad leaving their dog behind. I began to pack our things, too, Olenka. Got all our underwear mended and packed, and started on the dishes. Mama! I'm going on a date tonight. He's so wonderful, intelligent, honest, brave, he is... Mama? Please don't cry, Mama. Help you God, Olenka. Everything will be fine, like in the film "Spring Forever", remember? Help you God. These are refugees, peasants. Their villages have been burnt because they refused to unload military trains. I shot it on the 19th. On the 20th, the underground paper editor, Nikitenko, was arrested. You see, they first beat him up, him and his family, then took him away. And here they're arresting Trofimenko, member of the Revolutionary Committee. Seven years of czarist hard labour, he was informed on by a provocateur. He was also brutally beaten, thrown in a car and taken away. That day they took six more people. They all were shot in Belaya Pad, 15 kilometers from here. There... I couldn't get closer. No charge, no trial, no investigation. Arrested on denunciation and shot. Captain Fedotov, there he is on the left, chief of counterintelligence, personally supervised the execution. He and his assistant, Vyalin, former agent of the czar's secret service. They're friends. And at night they shot the workers, members of the strike committee, and their families. Now you will see it. Fedotov had forbidden to bury the killed. The relatives were allowed to see the bodies only three days later. Now you will see a woman... No, not this one. That woman had her husband and four children executed. That's all I've managed to shoot so far. The film has to be delivered to Moscow as soon as possible. Europe screams about the Bolsheviks' atrocities. I wish they've seen that. It's time to strike at hotels, ports, blow up ships! No, we can't do it, Sasha. Not only officers leave the country, but women and children as well. And what about our children? Do they spare us? Who will dare to judge us after seeing these shots? Olga Nikolayevna! Everything is ready, we can shoot. How is Olenka? She's all right. Go. Olga Nikolayevna, listen to me, look at me. You're a Russian, you're so kind. Did I ever hurt you? Have I ever done anything wrong to you? But, Olga Nikolayevna, my dear, we've got a contract. This is our work. And they wait for us in Paris. How can you just drop everything? You have no idea where you're going. You don't know what's going on in Moscow, my dear! Olga Nikolayevna! Lyubov Andreyevna, you tell her, it will be your ruin there! Olia, I beg you, say something! Why are you doing that to me? Alexander Alexandrovich, why don't you say something? I understand you, Olga Nikolayevna. I understand you very well. What we're doing is so awful, talentless, ridiculous. I wish I could board this train and... Go to Moscow... To Moscow. But! Well... in that case, I'm going to do this. Let's go and have ice-cream! Let's go! Let's go and have ice-cream! Now you can go anywhere you want! Mommy, come with us! Why didn't you let me leave? You've ruined my life, you must know that... you must know... That's the end of me. - I'm sorry, Olga Nikolayevna. - You're late! It's... it's not my fault, believe me, itjust happened this way. Drink your tea. But it's cold! It's all right, don't worry. Can you help me out once more? This is the finished film, it's very important. Keep it, and I'll come for it to your place tonight. All right? We could order lemonade. - The pathfinder. - You're not listening. I'm sorry, Olga Nikolayevna. That's all, I'm with you. My goodness, I haven't seen you for ages. I'm so glad to see you. What happened? Want a cigarette? No. Why do you smoke? What's the matter? I... I invited you here because I wanted to talk with you. I wanted to tell you... I wanted to tell you that I... That I'm in love with you. Olga Nikolayevna... Please, try to understand me... I still live by Moscow, by its life, by Maksakov... yes, Maksakov. Don't interrupt me! If only you could wait, wait for a little while. I... I can do everything. And my mother and the girls... We will all love you tenderly, only wait a little... Wait a little for me to be able... to get used to this feeling, do you understand? You have tears in your eyes? Oh, God! You love me? You love me very much? Yes, very much! And I... I love you too! Oh, God! I'm so happy I've said it all! You just wait, wait a little. All right? Olga Nikolayevna, my darling, I'm ready to wait for you forever. Fifteen men to South Street, quick! I love you so much that I'm ready to wait forever. Maximenko, cordon off Cathedral Street! Move! Well... I have to leave now. Tonight I'll come to you for tea with preserves. You got preserves? - Jam. - We'll drink tea with jam. With jam. And we'll talk about everything. I'll be waiting for you. Zhukov, Demyanov, Smirnov! To the corner of Station Street! Olga... I love you. Why haven't you gone to Moscow? Tkachuk, the truck! Captain! Toss him in. Hurry up. Go! Nothing... Let's go. Let me in! - You don't remember me? - No. - He said you were friends. - Who? You must remember! Take a better look at me. That night, the screening... That night... You don't remember me? You don't remember... You don't remember... But it's a lie! You're lying! My face is on the billboards all over, everybody knows me! Come on, open up! Oh, my goodness! You're a coward! Yes, yes, you're a coward! Traitor! You're afraid. You're afraid... They killed him. They killed him in the square. They killed him, killed him... Fedotov... Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! We'd agreed I'd pay you 30 rubles. But I decided to pay you 50, what they pay fashionable writers. I'm pleased with your work, though you have your own principles. Goodbye, my dear. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Well, goodbye, gentlemen. Farewell! I don't think we'll see each other again. Why are you so sad? It's October already. An unlucky month for me. I got my hand scalded in October, then my wife walked out on me in 1911, also in October. - Then Pototsky was killed. - What? You start it again? What can we do about it, it's war! Who asked him to meddle in this? We're not meddling, and we're alive. Are we? - What? - Are we alive? What kind of down in the dumps is that? I won't let you! Vadim! Do we have champagne? Bring champagne, quick! We must bid farewell to this country in good spirits, playfully and merrily! Oh, gentlemen! How happy I am! This is our last shooting day! It's over! Over! Yes... with no other film we've had so many difficulties. Even with "War and Peace", eh? Do you remember, Alexander Alexandrovich? I remember... Alexander Alexandrovich! Alexander Alexandrovich! Alexander Alexandrovich! Let's celebrate, Alexander Alexandrovich! Stop it! Stop it! Arert you ashamed? You're a gifted man, you've got no enemies. Take it away now! - Please. - Thank you. Only people without talent have no enemies. How many enemies Gorky and Vakhtangov have! So did Chekhov! You know, I'm sick and tired of being clever. - The tea is ready. - Thank you, Mashenka. What are those valorous warriors doing here? Quiet, gentlemen! They're Fedotov's men. Looking for some film again. - Where's he himself? - He's here, absolutely drunk. Quiet, gentlemen. We have to get out of here as quick as possible. Go anywhere, even it's hell itself. The Reds have broken the front. Fedotov is a dreadful man. Think of something, gentlemen, I beg you. Where's Olga Nikolayevna? Olga Nikolayevna is resting at the hotel, Herr Master. Thank you very much. Here I am! How are you, gentlemen? How are you? Go! Captain, give it back, please. I have to pack. Here, take it. Yes, gentlemen... I hate you so much, you can't even imagine. - Good evening. - Good evening. - I think we can shoot. - Yes, everything's ready. You should've asked me first! Whether we're going to shoot or not! - Featherbrains! Vyalin! - Yes, sir. How is it going? Nothing so far. We've combed everything. - Go on searching! - We are. Perhaps, while your men are searching, we could rehearse? No, no, no! Look at you so jumpy! - Kanin! - Yes, sir. You too think I'm a murderer? - No, never! - Good for you. I'm a sanitation worker. Cleaning the woods, understand? All right, rehearse your rubbish and I'll watch. Well, let's rehearse, let's rehearse. Where's Olenka? Where's Olga Nikolayevna? I'm here. Oh, you're here, Olenka. Sorry, I didn't see you. You look wonderful today. What do I do? Come with me, come... How are you, Olga Nikolayevna? Sit down, Olenka, sit down. So... So... this is the closing scene. I want to shoot it in one take. This is a scene before your suicide. Where's the revolver? - Alexander Alexandrovich... - Quiet... Quiet... Please... please... Olenka... I want... I want to shoot it... I want you just... Give me a smile. Just a smile and... You know, Olga Nikolayevna, it's like when you were a child... Olga Nikolayevna! Savva Yakovlevich... Attention! I repeat once more. Sasha and I will take care of the film, covering Olga Nikolayevna. Fedotov and Vyalin are to be executed by the Revolutionary Committee decree. - Right. - Let's go. Don't move! Everyone remain where you are! The house is surrounded. - Careful! - Calm down! Oh, God! Don't be afraid, Olga Nikolayevna. I had to act that way the other day, I had no right to act otherwise. Tell me please, dear, where is Pototsky's film? Calm down, please. In my dressing room, in the hat box. - Where is it? Upstairs, and to the right. Upstairs and to the right, quick! Olga Nikolayevna, we got only three minutes. Please, remain here. Don't leave, all right? Please, my dear man, don't leave me here! Olga Nikolayevna, don't delay me, or Fedotov will escape. - Where's the film? - I got it. - Where's he? - Must be here. The other one's dead. - On earth as it is in heaven. - To the left! Light up the corner! Look by the door! And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one... He's here! There he is! - Let's get out of here, guys! - Let's go! Nikolai, stop him! Stop! Stop him, Nikolai! Stop! - Where are you going? - I haven't done anything. She's an actress, a very famous one. Take her to the city, to downtown. To the hotel. And no stopping. You got me? I got you. You're responsible for her. Do it for me, please. - All right. - Good. Olga Nikolayevna, he'll take you to the hotel. Go! Olga Nikolayevna, everything will be all right. But don't leave your room, please, I ask you not to leave it! In two days our Red Army will be here. Good luck! Coming! Sasha, get away with the film! We'll cover you! Go! Are you a revolutionary? A revolutionary. Don't worry, we'll get out of this fog... And deliver you... In the best possible way. Here we are! Brothers! She's a revolutionary! I'm one of you, brothers! My name's Dubov. Captain Fedotov knows me. Hurry, or she'll escape! Wait! Where are you going? Oh, God! Where are you going? Stop! Oh, God! Why? Why? Where are you, my dream? Where are you, my dream? I keep hearing... May it be laughter, laughter, May it be weeping, weeping. It's you, my love. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! You're beasts! Gentlemen! You will be cursed by your country, soldiers! My heart is singing. Take it in your hands, And soothe it. I believe in you, yes. I believe in dreams, yes. I believe in love, yes. I believe in love. Yes, it will come, my dream! The End
