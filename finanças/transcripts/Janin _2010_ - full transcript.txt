"Starring" Promise that you will raise it. I promise. Oh, God! This is bad. Where does it leak, brother? The back got hit by the storm for good. We have to pull out the cranes, brother. The back side... Father? There is a hole at the bottom of my shoe. Water will flow in if I step on mud. Football will be played in next year's physical education. Budi. The school will start next month, right? That's right. But if I wear the old shoes, then my feet will be wrinkled due to moisture, the socks keep on getting wet. And I only have one pair of socks. Try persuade father, mother. Father promises every week, but he never buys it. Drink, dear. Dear, what should we do with Budi's shoes? Have I ever broken my promise to you or the children? No. Don't worry if it's about money. I can use the children's savings... The money are for their studies in the future. Don't question my responsibilities. I promise I will buy him a pair of shoes. I can tolerate you, why can't you do the same? Merdu, Budi. Come and have your lunch. Fifty, fifty six... Oh, no. I forgot. Ah Peng, help me pull down the curtain. I'm too lazy to move. You jerk. How dare you talk back to me in this way! Gosh! You scumbag! You only know how to make me angry. Lazy! You are good for nothing! Gosh! Still sitting there? What a lazy man! It's raining heavily outside. You never help me for one thing! You are good for nothing! You rascal... Hey! Where is my money? -Your money? I didn't take it. -Where is my money? -Of course you took it! -Not me! I'm just sitting here. Go and check on who's taking it! Who's that? Nobody is outside. Now I will need to call you teacher, right? Well, Uncle Wan, just call me Onn. No way. If not, it will be a waste for your studies. Onn, can you help me teach Rahimah later? STPM examination is getting near. For you, I won't charge you any. And I will teach Kalsom too. She got an offer to study at Matriculation in Londang... but she rejected it! She rather took STPM in this village... in hope of staying under my protection. Your protection or someone else? Mine of course. Who else could it be? I too can provide protection under here. Instead of staying under your protection, it's better to be my son-in-law. Right? My dream of making a teacher my son-in-law will be realised. Aunt Temah and Uncle Wan... always like to annoy me. Huh? -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. The two of you. See, they are here. Alaq, look at you. If you were studying well last time, you can be like Mister Onn. You can become teachers. You know? We like to go to the sea. Do you think going to the sea is a high standard job? Come on, you can be like Mister Onn. Later, there will be more teachers in this village. That's great! But the problem is both your jobs are not stable. Just like today. A small storm and you're loitering at my shop. I almost forget. The teacher's beverage hasn't arrived yet. Rahimah, where is Onn's beverage? Please drink it. I'm going to the kitchen for a while. I've told you to follow my footsteps, but both of you won't listen. Look, fixed salary every month. I'm getting quarters too. I have plenty of holidays as well. I'll be in holidays when the students are in holidays. It's easy for me to get married too. You haven't started teaching and already showing off. Hey, I'm not showing off. I was just trying to persuade you... to be like me. That's all. What the heck? How are you, Brother Alaq? I'm fine. Rahimah! Yes, father! Come inside! Give me a year, once confirmed, I'll get her to marry me. Hey, did you see how she is being shy in front of me? Onn, you have a lot of money, right? Can you treat me then? You said I haven't started working, haven't this and that, and now you ask me to treat you? No! But it's fine if you want me to lend some money. What the heck? It's only 60 cents. No! No way! Not even for 60 cents. Kalsom, give me the bill! What? I swear, chief. After I came back from the bank, I went straight to the coffee shop. I don't have much savings in the account, my first salary hasn't been received yet. This might be a time of high theft activity. Yesterday, Ah Man lost RM500 from his shop. Yes, that's right. Thiaga told me he lost RM2,000 too. -RM2,000? -Yes! -It's not a small amount. -That's a lot. I think... this must be the doings of the drug addicts. Who else could it be if it wasn't them? Yes, you're right. Brother Long Momid, now you're the headmaster in this village. You must take good care of the students. Don't let them be! Or else, they'll all become drug addicts! Our village and the school reputation will be tarnished then. Don't just ignore it like the previous headmaster did. The previous headmaster isn't from here. He feels different for his responsibility. I'm not like him. My heart is still here even though... I spent 10 years working outside of this village. -He's right... -Yeah. Could it be the ghost? My uncle always catches ghosts in another village. Could it be the ghost? -Ghost? -Ghost? -Did anyone see ghost? -Yeah? If there is, then we should call the shaman. Onn, what are you talking about? You are a teacher, yet you're being superstitious. This is human. We always blame the supernatural for something... when they can't explain it. It's not me. But it's Alaq and Khir. Chief, don't believe in superstitions. We're living in the modern world. Of course we're not going to live like the old days. If else, the whole village will be outdated then. -Yeah, of course. -You're right. These are the thoughts of the uneducated people. This is how it is. They still believe in superstitions! Nonsensical! Hey, no one would stop you from living in this village. You can be outdated all you want, but don't try to influence the villagers' mind... like how both of you are thinking. Understood? Chief, I apologise on behalf of my crews, Khir and Alaq. I believe they were just joking. I'm sorry. Sorry. You should suggest doing neighbourhood watch. -Me? -Yeah, you! Say it yourself! Chief, why don't we start a neighbourhood watch? I was in the Territorial Army Regiment when in school! So, matters regarding the safety of our village, patrolling at night, don't worry. Leave it to me. It's because I'm an expert. All of those things are already in my head. Chief, please gather some young men in this village. Then, you can just stay at home. I think I agree with the idea. So now, we'll gather the young men from this village, and we'll do a neighbourhood watch. We will patrol at night. Okay? -All agree? -Yes! Agreed! Budi, look at my shoes. This shoes can glow in the dark. There is a reflector in it. The bottom is soft, it feels great when you're chasing the ball. No point buying expensive shoes if you can't kick it far. What a jerk. Here! Oh, no! Can't make a goal. What an expensive shoes! You haven't sleep yet, my child? Why aren't you sleeping? Why aren't you sleeping? Do you want to drink milk? Here! Oh, man. Can't make a goal. Mum, help me tie her hair up. Merdu, wait a moment. I need to feed your brother first. I'll help you afterwards. Later... Merdu, I'm holding you brother. I'll help you later. Drink, my child. Sutera! Oh, my God! Munah! -It hurts! -Why are you pulling my son's ears? -Stop it, Aunt Munah! It hurts. -Come here! Your son dares to steal at a young age. -It hurts. -Now you feel the pain? He stole my orchid vase to use it as a goal post. How dare you? I just borrowed it. I thought you're not using it. Hey, it doesn't matter. It's mine even if I'm not using it. Didn't your parents teach you to respect other people's belonging? Munah, the vase isn't even broken. I'm going to kill him if my vase is broken. I'm talking about my vase. Come here, let me show you. -Munah! -Here! Don't fight back! -Let go. -I clean that vase every day. Now that you've touched it, it's full of germs from your hands. Munah, I'll clean it up for you later. Don't even think about it! I'm the only one who can clean the vase. -Let me go! -Only I can do it. -It hurts. -Don't fight back! Stop hitting my son. That's enough. This vase is expensive. I bought it in Air Hitam. I want you to pay! Exactly the same like it! Munah, that's enough! Don't hit my son! Even though my son took your vase, but it has stayed there and hasn't been touched for years, Munah. Gosh! It's easy for you to say. -No wonder your son behaves like this. -Enough, Munah... -Let it go! Step aside. -Munah, he didn't steal it. You've to watch over your son wherever he goes. -It hurts! -Now you know! You know that you're wrong! Do you still remember about your child? Do you? Don't let the history repeat itself. Munah! Don't you dare teach me how to bring up my children. -Munah. -Let it go. Let's go home. This is embarrassing. Dear, he took my vase. I'll buy a new one. What's with the fuss? Why would you be the one who replace it? Don't tell me... -You're having an affair with her! -Hey, Munah! Munah! Be careful with your words! Go home now! -Go home! I said, go home now! -Pay me back! Eight hours a shift. There'll be five groups in a shift. Each group consists of two people. So, I've divided our village into 5 sections... or zones. I hope... all of you will guard over your own zones... according to the shifts assigned by me. Understand? Yes. -Understand? -Yes! Everyone will be given a torchlight... and a whistle. If you face any problem, please blow the whistle loudly! Don't try to be a hero. Go and chase the thieves yourself. If the thief has a weapon, then you're going to get killed. Remember this! When your shift ends, please return all these to me. The most important thing is, please clean the whistle properly. If not, it'll get dirty. The others need to use it too. Darn, it's not enough. Hey, Alaq. Did you know? -He joined the Army to court girls. -How did you know? -He told me so. -Let it be. Let it be? Hey, are you crazy? Do you wish to see Rahimah and Onn being together? Enough, let's go. What is it? Hey, is this a neighbourhood watch or a family watch? Go and chase that frog away. It's there every two nights. My ears can't stand it. Let it be. It just want to make noise. That's the same frog as that night. It's trying to call for rain. Gosh! You're so lazy. Don't bother with it. Let's just sleep. The night is getting late. Sleep? It's too noisy. The frog is here. -Why didn't you tell me? -I just don't want to. Lewd! I'll tell mum. -Hey, Alaq. -What? This is a stupid thing to do. Oh, God! Quick, hide! Run! Hurry! Mum. What are you doing, mum? I'm trying to chase that frog away. It's so annoying. If you want to court a girl, please do it at the other place. Brother! My jewellery are gone, brother! Who was it? That is someone. Someone is there. Call them now! -Alaq, Khir! -Get help now. Here! Alaq! Go and search for it! -What's wrong? -Search for it! -Kumi got robbed. -Robbed? Sister Kumi, calm down. Take it easy. Tell us who stole it. -Who? Who was it? -I didn't see it. It came from behind and everything has gone. What is the use of keeping just a ring? Calm down. There! What is that? It's at the bush. Go! Go! Why are you here? My jewellery got stolen. Why are you coming back? Chase that thief now. But how could I leave you? Where, Khir? There! Alaq, let's go! Where has it gone to? Come, quick! Hurry! Hold on! There he is! Stop! Hey! Stop! "Chanting" Khir! Khir! Khir. What's wrong? Tell me! What is it? Khir? Khir! -That's enough. Let's go! -There... Your lamp. That's enough, let's go. Oh, God! The Almighty. Did you see the person you're chasing after? Hey! The old men are asking, just answer it! Is he one of our villagers or... Hey, are you trying to cover him? No, Uncle Basir. I swear to God. Hey. He must be the son of Uncle Tugiman. He's your good friend, right? He always steals rambutan from Ah Peng's house. Do you understand? This is not human! I know what I saw! The one I chased after is not human. The thing I chased after was... -a ghost! -What? -A ghost? -A ghost? You're always talking about ghost... since that day! "Hall of Kampung Sentosa" Why are you keeping quiet? You saw it too, right? Forget it. They won't believe us. How can you simply said that? I saw it with my own eyes. It's small in size. You saw it too, right? But they won't believe it no matter what you said. Why would we even try if they won't even trust us? If that thing really exists, someone will surely see it too. Let the time decides it. Come and follow me. -Wait for me, brother. -Be quick. Hello. Thanks. Thank you. Merdu, come quick. What are you going to buy with the money? -I want to buy a pair of sports shoes. -For what? Because I want to. But you're not good at playing football. Shut up, or I won't bring you along next time. I'll tell mum. You promised. If only I could eat ice-cream now. All right, let's go. Budi! Budi, come and eat! In a while, father. Is the money to repair your boat enough? You just need to take care of the kids. Let me handle my boat issue. How about Budi's new shoes? It's okay if I barefooted. Dear. Is it you or Budi that wanted the shoes? It's okay, mum. Eat! The more you steal, the more you can eat. The villagers said they saw you. Don't let anyone knows that I'm your owner. Be more careful, understand? Understand? What do you want to sell to me? It's just a few of it. That's enough. Stop bothering me. Oh, man. That's enough. Hey, you're troublesome. Here, bring it back. Hey! -Harun, how's today's catch? -Yes. -Not bad. -Where? -How many kilograms? -25 kilograms. Twenty five kilograms. Twenty five kilograms. Here, this is for the three of you. This is too much, chief. It isn't much. It's not even enough to repair your boat, right? Of course. But it did help relieve it a bit. -Thanks, chief. -You're welcome. -I'll see you at the jetty. -All right. I want this in size 6. All right, wait a moment. Okay. Ah Loy! Ah Loy. Hey, have you finished repairing my boat? Harun? Yes, it's done. Really? You should jump higher to catch the ball. It's only been a day with new shoes and now you're teaching me. You didn't lift your legs while jumping. At least I didn't run like a girl. I told you my shoes are tight. -Come, let me kick your head. -Hey! It's not fun playing with the head. -I'm leaving now. -Hey! He's not back even after nightfall. Great. It's all right. I'll wait. I'll wait. Let's see what is your excuse then. Budi bin Harun! You tried to steal my bracelet? Don't go anywhere. Do you want to run away with the bracelet you stole? Running away, huh? Give it back. -Give it back! -What bracelet? Don't try to act innocent. Open the bag! -Here! -No! Show it to me first before you say it's not there. Give it to me! Why are you so stubborn? Munah! Dear! Munah! Let it go! You really are stubborn! Give it back! I've asked for so many times! Don't you feel pain? What is it now, Munah? What do you mean? Your son is useless. -Don't hold his head. -Don't touch my son! Hey, your son came into my house when I was sleeping. He stole my bracelet. Let's see what is inside his bag. -Is it true, Budi? -Let's see, shall we? Give it to me. -Mum... -I said let go! -I said let it go! -Mum... -You're really stubborn. -Hey! Don't hold my son's head. See what is inside. Whose shoe is this, Budi? I'm asking, whose shoe is this? Where did you get the shoes? I bought it, father. I swear to God! Where did you get the money to buy this shoes? I swear, I bought it. -Did you steal people's money? -No! -Tell me! -Don't lie! Hey, shut up! Don't touch him! -Come here. -Dear! You stole some money and bought this shoes, right? You're embarrassing me. Follow me! Don't interfere. -I never taught you to steal. -Father, he didn't steal it. Father! He didn't steal it! -Father! He didn't steal it! -Hey! Don't interfere. Dear... That's enough, dear. Who taught you to steal? Brother! Mum, he didn't steal it. You're embarrassing me! You little thief! I'm sorry, Harun. Maybe Munah misplaced it. Hey! Why did you blame me? I misplaced it? Dear, I wore the bracelet. I didn't misplace it. It's Budi... Enough, Munah! Didn't you feel anything when your bracelet it unhooked? -Dear, let me keep it. -Let me keep it. Or else, it will go missing again. Sutera, I'm so sorry. Harun, I'm sorry too. -Go home! -All right. Gosh! I'm enjoying it until the commercial is aired. Hey, wait here. -Harun! -Hey, what's wrong? Dear, it hurts! Dear, it hurts so bad! Help me, dear! Oh, God! Drive carefully! Watch out for the hands! Alaq, drive this car. Quick! Drive this car. Hurry up! Chief, you must do something. Because you're the headman. Remember! Do something. -Step aside. -Hurry up, dear! -Drive slowly, be careful. -Slowly, be careful! What is going to happen to our village, chief? None of this happened in the last 10 years. No! Never! Chief. Did Onn really see a ghost? -Did he? -He said so. -He did? -Yes. Onn! Are you okay? I'm okay. Have you been attacked? How could it attacked me? I recited the Kursi, you know? It stepped back. Then, what else? I recited it louder. It stepped back again. It's because my elocution is right. Then that thing ran into the bush. A series of tragedies happened in our village... and the latest victims are Uncle Wan Atan's family. I, as the headman in this village, would like to remind all of you... that we don't know what we're facing with now. So, I hope... for an expert in this matter... to solve the problem we're facing now. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you, too. I'm Uncle Jamal. In order to save the villagers, every house must be fenced off to block it from coming in. "Chanting" "Chanting" "Chanting" Starting from the right side of the house, facing the corners and say prayers in your heart. It's locked and be locked. Creatures that is alive or dead, those with bad intentions towards me, are prohibited from doing anything bad to me. Where are you going, Merah? Merah? Going out at night. Oh, God. Merah? Munah! Come inside. Dear, I'm looking for Merah. I don't know where it goes. Let it be. Didn't Uncle Jamal warned us not to go out at night? Or else, the fence will fall. If Merah got hit, who would be responsible? It's you! Munah! Munah, come inside! Su. What are you looking at? I heard a kid crying out there. Nothing. I didn't hear anything. Enough, close the window. Go back to sleep. Here it is, Budi. Thank you, father. You'll send the kids to school today. Don't get wrapped up. Never lose sight on them even once. Dear. Don't you ever. Budi, hold your sister's hand until you've reached home. All right, father. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you, too. Why didn't I get any new shoes? Your brother's shoes has worn out. Where is the shoes that dad threw the other day? Someone else took it. Let's go. Close the gate, Budi. It's empty? Esah! Why is it empty? It's empty! Darn you! I'll teach you a lesson. Wait there! Dear! Wait there! Dear! Look, dear. It's all empty. Nothing! What is empty here? It's been days since she came back without anything. There's nothing here. No money or jewellery! If she continues like this, it'll be tough for us. She makes my life difficult! How dare you, useless slave! Ungrateful! You never knew your place! Hey! You only know how to eat! Lazy at work. You know that this village is being fenced off now, why didn't you go look for another village? Darn you! Dear... Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, Momid. Momid? Momid? Momid? Chief, let's go outside. Momid. Oh, God! This is a case of a ghost killing her owner. They said Long Momid has gone for Hajj a few times. There are ghosts without owner out there. When there are no owners, it's hard to be controlled. This can put the villagers in danger. Chief, this is very dangerous. Munah? Munah? Munah? Munah? Munah? Munah! Munah. Munah. Oh, my God! Who are you actually? Who are you? Thank God. She has delivered, Harun. A baby girl. Praise be to God. Does she have a name? Inaiyah. Inaiyah binti Harun. -Sutera. -Dear. -I'll not come back tonight. -You're not coming home? I'll be sleeping there. I need to sew a net. Be careful, dear. Take care of the kids. Don't take your eyes off of her. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Peace be upon you too. Harun, you're going out to the sea tonight? Yes, where else should I go? -Munah, what is it? -A cake. Come in. Oh, God. Your husband is really hardworking. You're lucky to marry Harun. Trust me. Do you still remember that Sister Ipah's story? Poor her. The whole village believed her husband is a hardworking man. He's working every day. Suddenly, he brought back his honey. It's okay if it's the honey in the bottle. It's tasty, right? This honey has legs and hands. What the heck? Munah, you always have stories. I just want to remind you. It's the same with my cousin, Wati. -Have you met her husband? Rashiq? -No. Oh, God. He looks like a torpedo scad. I'm serious. That was close to happen too. Can you imagine? What if it is your husband, Harun? He is handsome and cool. Hey, surely any woman would fall for him. Inaiyah. Inaiyah! Inaiyah! Inaiyah! Inaiyah! Sutera. Dear, Inaiyah... Dear, Inaiyah... Inaiyah... Harun Muhammad Ali? Yes. Have you lost a child before? Ten years ago. Your child has returned. Please take care of your siblings. Don't go anywhere. Don't open the windows and doors. It's dangerous, all right? Yes, father. Her instinct is still like a kid. She wants to play, be loved, and be spoiled. Her instinct still needs love. But her characteristics won't allow it. This is all my fault, Uncle Jamal. What have I done? As a mother, I should protect my children, but I killed my own daughter, Uncle Jamal. What kind of mother am I, Uncle Jamal? We are humans. Our fate has been written by God. We should take it as lessons in life. What else you don't understand? That is not our child. Listen, all! Men, get ready. Alaq, Khir, Onn. Don't get wrapped up. Ladies, stay at the back. Sutera, get ready. Call your daughter's name until she comes back. Move, now! Budi, go inside. Close all doors. Inaiyah. Inaiyah. Inaiyah. Dear... Hey, get the jar! Put her inside the jar! No, Uncle Jamal! No! Don't come any closer! Step back! I said step back! Step back, now! Sutera! Dear, step back. Sutera! Forgive me, my dear. Forgive me, my child. God is the Greatest! -Let it go! It hurts! -You know you're wrong! Do you still remember about your child? Remember? You want the history to repeat itself? Focus. Never lose your sight on them. Dear. Never. Inaiyah. I'm a bad mother. I killed my own daughter. That is not our daughter, Sutera. Inaiyah has died long time ago. You're not guilty. The rest of you, let's bury the body properly. I'll never lost sight on the children. -Never. -I understand.
