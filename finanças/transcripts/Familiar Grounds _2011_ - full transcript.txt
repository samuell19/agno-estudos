FAMILIAR GROUNDS and in the role of the man from the future And? The price is too high. It's not the season yet. Exactly. When spring comes... FOR SALE Come on! Come on! Michel, get the first aid kit. What's the matter? Is there mayonnaise? Of course. It's tasteless. Because of your pills. You tried to start the Ski-Doo? It's busted. Want me to try? It's busted, I said. Dad... Dad! The doc said to go easy. There. Just prime it once or you'll drown it. Once it's going, hit the gas two three times. Two hits, like that. What a jerk! Did you see that? Idiot! Did they put it on ice? Huh? Did they put his arm on ice? Cause maybe they can sew it back. If they ice it fast enough. They put my uncle's finger in a snowball. The doctors sewed it back. Maybe they can with arms now. I don't know if they iced it. I didn't notice. -Want any more? -No, thanks. Maryse? Yes. You OK? Sure. Your brother's on the phone. I'm coming. What? Dad asked me to confirm our dinner. He called twice. It's so complicated. Look, he told me to call. Well? Well? What? Can you confirm? Yeah, sure. - Calm down. - I am calm. - Fine, see you Friday. - OK, bye. What did he want? The dinner for my mom. Right. It's really important to put the basket in the sink cause it clogs up. Right. - What? - Turn it down! It's not loud! Dad! I said it's not loud! I'm at 1. The house is shaking. Hi. Think they put his arm on ice? What? 'Cause maybe then they could sew it back. I dunno. Think so? Alain says they sewed his uncle's finger on. Anything's possible. If it's a clean cut... Anything's possible. Didn't they sew back some guy's penis? His wife cut it off while he was asleep. Where you going on that? Wherever you want. I'll go slow. Yeah, I bet. I'll go around the block, check the lots. Get on before I change my mind. Coming over tonight? Is your kid home? Yeah. So? He doesn't like me. Big baby! Are you coming or not? I dunno. Ok, I'll take that for a yes and cook us supper. - Don't hurt yourself! - I know. Pull hard! I'm going out. Dressed like that? What? Your shirt. What about it? Why wear that? Why not? You like girls who like girls? No, it's not that. It's a joke. - Well, do you? - Need anything? Careful what messages you send. Sometimes, you think it's clear, but... Don't wait up. Shut the door tight for once. I'm not heating all Canada. Your sister's coming tomorrow! What's that? To apologize. Well, don't just stand there. Come in. One sec, I'm on the phone. Oh yeah? So then... Are you picking him up? Look, I've had it. Are you going or not? Just forget it. Listen... Hi. Look. This is for you. Stop it. Please. Please. - Stop. - Simon! Stop, please. Will you quit pestering our guest? Please stop. Stop. What did I say? Go talk to your dad. Come on, move! He can be so stubborn. Did he bite you? No, it's fine. Wow! You dressed up. Yeah. Do you like it? I'm not very good with those things. There's an instruction card. I'll help you. Oh yeah? I will. What is it? I think you're beautiful. Hungry? Here, open this up. I've been wrestling with it for an hour. Simon's impossible after he's been at his dad's. Too hard? Relax. - You're beet red. - I'll get it! OK, stop. Stop! Need any help? No, no. I think I'll be OK. Attention, shoppers. Please note that the store will close... What's wrong? I dunno. What is it? I dunno what it is. Want to lie down? I don't know why I'm... It's silly. Go lie down a bit. OK. A little while. I'll be quiet. What did I say? I'm eating slowly. It's just a sliver. That's it. Give me your plate. - I'm hungry. - You'll eat cereal. Not cereal! How come he can? Benoit! What did I do? Mom! Enough! Go to your room. Benoit Bosse, don't pout! Why can't I stay? It's not easy. You complicate everything. I'm doing what I can. And I'm not? I'm waiting for you. Does he know I'm moving in? You didn't tell him? If you don't like it... What? Say it! Are you dumping me? I'm just saying... You're dumping me in a stairway. Look... What am I for you? A plan B? Is that what I am, a shitty plan B? Call when you're calmer. - You won't win! - Whatever. Nathalie! Nathalie! I'm calm now. I'm calm! What now? Go fuck yourselves! All of you! Shit! What is it? A problem with the Ski-Doo. Is that my shirt? Alright. What's the problem? Here, hold this! What the hell did you do? Dad? Dad, are you OK? Hold it so I can see! No more Ski-Doo for you. Not till you grow up. OK. You're cooking dinner tomorrow. I'm seeing my doctor. OK. Can't you sleep? Sure. What? I want the backhoe gone. We're selling it. I want it gone. I don't want to see it. It's not easy to move. My dad has a trailer. I'll go get it. Yes? I come from the future. Are you hungry? Very kind. How's the future? I haven't traveled far. Only a couple months. I come from next September. That's... 6 or 7 months, I guess. You'll have a great summer. Nice weather. In fact, I came about your sister. - My sister? - Yeah. I have that garage on the highway. With that blue inflatable... Right. - You know? - I've seen that blue guy, yeah. It was my idea. An attention-grabber. People remember it. Your sister... is going to have a bad accident. Head-on. A blizzard. She'll die if she goes. You're sure it's my sister? I went to the funeral. I met you there. It's important, she can't go. Well, I'll be on my way. Can we help? No. How's work going? It's alright. There was an accident. Oh yeah? It's not important. - Did you find it? - Just a second. Did Maryse tell you I'm doing the Tour de France? I'm going at my own pace. But still, it's... How many kms did I say? I dunno, Alain. I dunno. Anyway, I gave myself a year. And the bike? I don't know what you did. It's way better. On the hills... Good! And your health? Getting there? Are you doing it on purpose? Why would I do it on purpose? I can't find it. Gimme a break! Take my knife. Here... That knife is so practical. It does everything. Like, if you're lost in the woods or, I dunno, you want to cut something. It does everything. It was a present from Maryse. Our third anniversary? What? Just a drop. I'm driving. And me? Not with your pills. Go on! I'd like us to toast your mother. Who... It'll be five years. She still watches over us and protects us. And... It's important to remember her. And... That's what I wanted to say. To your mom. To Mom! I suggest a minute of silence. Good idea. Starting... now. Careful, it's hot. I thought it'd make more. What is it? A tiny chicken? A partridge? It crashed into the door. It didn't see there was a window. Can partridges fly? This one flew. It was stunned. Nearly dead. What do you mean, nearly? I had to sorta knock it out. We can't eat it. Why not? What did I miss? She's a bit edgy these days. Why are you two always squabbling? Does it make sense to you? Excuse me? God-damn family of retards! I wanted one night for your mom! What's in your damn pea-brain? - We better go. - No, no! We can eat together without screaming. We're not savages! Dad? Do you still have the trailer? Yes, it's at the cottage. I'll go get it. I'll rent a car. I'll go tomorrow. I'll go with you. A storm is heading our way after leaving record snowfalls out west. We're in for a real treat these next few days. A storm warning is in effect for the Appalachians and north-east regions. OPEN Know where the key is? - In the barbecue. - In the barbecue. Come in for a minute. Have a coffee. No, Alain's waiting. Does he have to come along? My mind's made up. Jeez! What's keeping your brother? Benoit! Hello? Hello. Is your mom home? Simon, stop it. Is your mom home? Yeah. Put her on please. No. Cut it out. Put her on. No. Alright then, just listen to me. Tell your mom she'll be rid of me, I'm leaving. She'll be sorry. Simon, who is it? Hello? Benoit! Fuck! Fuck! Coming. Finally! Bye. Well, see you. Benoit, we'll talk about the Ski-Doo when you're back. Drive carefully, a storm's coming. Hi! Hi. What? There's something on the door. Here. Scratches in front on the driver's side. I guess it's OK. Sign here. Your copy. Who gets these? Thanks. Call if you need me. Look at your hands. Did you treat it? It can get infected. You didn't treat it? No, I didn't treat it. Pull over. Pull over! Stop! What's wrong? I think we should go back. This isn't a good idea. Why not? We're going back, that's all. Let Alain deal with it. Alain and I, it's not working. I'm confused. I bought you socks. Do you like them? They were on sale. Thank you. What? First time we have coffee together. I don't know what you take. Nothing. I take it black. Same here. Sure you turned on the heat? It takes time. How'd you hurt your hands? I dunno. You don't know? It's from fighting. Who with? A snowman. Did you win? Gimme a break! Now? No. Now? No. Now? No. It's not working. Now? Yes? Yes. We looked. It's not that. I don't know, Alain. We'll manage. Benoit is making a fire. Does Alain know? I'm not sure. Sometimes, you think it's clear, but... But what? It's not clear? Forget it. - That's all there was? - Yeah. And Dad's private stock? This is Dad's private stock. The wood's wet. I know the wood's wet. - Sure you don't want any? - No, no. Maybe I will have some. What do we do? Hi there. How are you doing? What the...? These are the Bosses. Maryse and Benoit. The next cottage over. They need some wood. Maryse used to babysit us. Glad to see you. It's been ages. For sure. A drink? We can't stay long. Well, I'd love a little something. Perfect, come in. It's my birthday. Happy birthday. Well, not yet, later. There'll be fireworks. - Really? - Yeah. You like fireworks? Sure, they're so beautiful. The colors, the lights in the sky. I hate them. - It hasn't changed. - Nope. So you babysat Pat. A few times. So, your parents OK? Yeah. Does your dad still repair bicycles? Yeah. - I think so. - Good. Wait! Got a shovel? - Why? - You'll see. Get me a shovel! Get me a shovel! It was just an excuse. Are we going? Well... We were talking. Let's go. Five minutes? Get off her case. She doesn't want to go. Looking for trouble? OK, let's go. What do you bench? You look like you work out. Man, calm down. We're having fun. Let's go. What was that? What about you? What's wrong with you? You've been weird all day. You want to know? I've been having a shit winter. Not just a shit winter, I have this shit power. My hands... Everything I touch turns to shit. Nothing works out. Now you know. Now that's clear, can we move on? OK. Fine. I'm sorry. That's alright. Maryse? Maryse! We're pathetic. Maybe we're like Mom, not made for winter. Remember? She always got depressed. She'd fly off the handle, burst into tears. Dad said she needed light. Didn't he rig up a box for her? Yeah. I miss her. God, I hate fireworks. Wait! What's wrong? You OK? Yeah. Good night. Maryse? It'll be OK with Alain. I know. Let's go. The heater's working. I said it takes time. Get your stuff. I'll drive. Maryse! We'll have a great summer. Nice weather. Subtitles: Robert Gray, Kinograph DVD Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
