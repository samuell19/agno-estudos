So, playing with this year's concept, "The Light of Christmas," I went from day to night, light to dark, ending here. Or, alternatively, we could reverse the order. Start here, and then move towards the... The order doesn't matter. I like what you've captured. You do? The architectural aspect is super high-concept, and well, your point of view as a photographer has always been unique. That's why we've hired you, for, what... Six assignments, so far. But this? This is the magazine insert for Christmas Day. It's not only a great portfolio piece, it's also, as you know, a chance to join our staff. I know. I know. I can't believe an opening came up. And since it showed up over the holidays, we thought, why not offer it to the photographer who lands the Christmas spread? I love that. And I'm very grateful to be in the running. Look, I'm a fan of these, I am, but... Is that a maybe? We'll see what the chief says. Thank you. Christmas or not, you'll absolutely get our volume discount. Okay, great. I'll send our rates over now. Merry Christmas. Please tell me he said yes. He said it's up to the chief. How's that? That's great! Is it? Yeah. Anne loves your work. And when you start here, just think. Lunches all the time. How fun is that? I know, I just... I don't want to get too excited just yet. You know? You're the hardest worker I know. You're gonna land this spread, and the position. Just, is it what you want? It's a lot of 9:00 to 5:00. Yeah, I wish I could say I was cut out for the hustle, but... 9:00 to 5:00 sounds pretty good right about now. You know? Maybe it would be good to change up the pace. Hey, it might even give you some time to go on that date with my neighbour. What? He's cute. I'm sure he is, I just... ...Haven't been on a date in way too long? ...Need to get through this next week first. How are you feeling? About going back to the Cape? Your family's summer home. I don't know. I mean, I... I used to love going there. And how long's it been? Thirteen years. But you have a lot of great memories there. Yeah. Yeah, every summer. But it's gonna be great. It's where my Dad met Helen, they're gonna retire there. I've never been for Christmas or a wedding, so... Yeah, that's the spirit. Just go, relax, and enjoy Christmas. Two double lattes, please. Ta-Dah. Wait, what's this? I thought we said no presents. It's just a little somethin'. Stop. Is this my apartment? I mean, yeah. You say you're never there, so I thought you could leave it at your desk. You're amazing. I love it. Merry Christmas. I would like mine in this, please. Hi, Dad. Yep. Yep, no, I'm literally walking out the door right now. I've already packed the car. Yep, of course. I'll drive safe. Dad, gotta get off the phone to get in the car. Bye. Mrs. Miller, I know the holidays are slow, but we should be able to find you a tenant before New Year. Yep. No, I... I can't tell you where I'm gonna be moving the snowman. It... that would be cheating. Happy Holidays. Hey, bud. Hey buddy. I know you're busy. I just want to let you know I'm still working on getting you that interview. You do realize this is poaching, don't you? I'm sorry, I was just... My mom's kidding, Josh. Of course. Merry Christmas, Mrs. Phillips. You're not five anymore, Josh. You can call me Judy. And, it's not poaching if I'm the one asking. I just wish your agency wasn't all the way in London. IF I get the job. I'll try and set something up before Christmas. You're the best. Yes, I am. I'll see you tomorrow night, buddy. All right. Bye. So, you really want to move? I just wish we had more exciting work for you. I love it here, Mom. That's not the issue. It's just, everything that happened with Beth. I dunno, I think change could be good. We just want you to be happy. Me? I am happy. I'm very happy. Look. Look at this smile. This is a happy smile. Very happy. Hey, we need you to get over there as soon as you can. Okay. Where am I going? A leak at the River Street rental. And, since they're family friends... You are Mr. Fix It. I don't know about all that, but I can take a look. Okay, great. And, while you're there, see if you can ask Lee about his plans. What they're gonna do with the house after the wedding? I left them a message. Okay. I got this. Shoot. I am so sorry. I... I was turning around, I didn't expect to see anyone coming. To my driveway? Well, at the exact same... Sam? Mike? Hi. It's... it's been a... ...A long time. Dad. Honey. So good to see you. Good to see you. You're the handyman? I am today. Well, grab your tools. Let's get at it. Honey, how was your drive? It's good. Yeah? Yeah, it's so different here. I noticed the drip this morning. It's not good. Ooh. Yeah, okay, all right, well, I'm on it. I just need to get up into your attic. Okay. Thanks, Mike. Now, how long have you known Mike? You know, I don't even remember when we met, we were so young. No. They were inseparable as kids. Yeah, for the summers when we came here. Yeah, but, I mean, best friends with school kid crushes, it was... Dad, that's a long time ago. It's nice to see you two together again. Okay, you know what, I think you've talked your way outta getting your treats. No. No. Is that something that you requested from the city? Honey, we've been here for two weeks. Two weeks and loving it, yeah. But nothing beats Boston coffee and did you get the holiday... Yes. Good girl. Now I know that you were born and raised here, so you probably have all your own holiday chocolates all lined up, but this is from our favourite local store. It's not too sweet, it's not too minty, and I figured it would help you push through that final little wedding planning. Peppermint bark is my favourite. I kid you not. I love this. Thank you so much. Yay. What else do we got? What other treats? I can't believe you made this. I used to make 'em every year with my art students. Even though I'm retired, I figured I would just keep the tradition going. And since this is our first Christmas together, I thought that it was the perfect Christmas slash... ...slash Wedding gift, right? Perfect. And there's chocolates in every one of 'em. Oh, cute. I'll get out of your guys' hair. But, looks good up there. If you have any more leaks, just give us a call. I definitely will. And, tell your dad that I'll call him another time about the house stuff, okay? Will do. Okay. All right, good to see ya. You too. I'll see you guys all at the wedding. Hey. Good to see you. Yeah, you too. I mean, except for the near collision outside, but... Yeah, well, hey. You never were a very good driver. Hey. I was learning, and I was being responsibly cautious. Yeah. 15 miles an hour, rocking out to Sarah McLachlan? You can't speed to Sarah. Nah? Okay. Well, I know you're going to be busy this week, but if you need a Christmas in the Cape tour guide, let me know. Thanks. Yeah. But you're gonna be busy with your family and your wife, and all that. I'm, yeah, I'm not married anymore. What? I guess I... I figured you woulda heard. No... no, I didn't... I didn't hear that. I'm so sorry. It's all good. Really is. And, I wanted to say I'm sorry too. For what? That summer. Your mom got sick. I really meant to... Thank you. But we don't need to talk about that. Okay. 'Kay. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. It took four people- Four- to get the tree in. Okay, how big is your tree? And, we actually had to cut a foot of it off to even get it in. I've always been a sucker for the most ridiculously large Christmas trees. And holiday weddings. Well, okay, I will admit it. I'm a little Christmas crazy. It's a Christmas Eve wedding. Exactly. With our closest friends and family. It's just my absolute favourite time of the year. It always makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger. So, it's an unconventional day for a wedding, but... But perfect for us. It is. And finding this love now is my own Christmas miracle. Mine too. Well, I got that tree decorated, and I'd love for you to come see it. So, do you want to come by the house, and we can make some cookies, or finish making the chocolate moulds for the wedding favours? Yeah, but not tomorrow. Oh, no. Why, what's tomorrow? We're going to get your Christmas tree. We wanted you here to get the tree. Yeah. And we have to swing by the hotel and finish some details with the wedding coordinator. You don't have to go if you think it's gonna be boring. I mean, you could always check out the town. It's a lot different at Christmas than what you're used to. Thank you. Well, I have some very special Christmas bark that I'd like to share. May I interest you? Christmas bark. Yes. I'm gonna need some extra energy, 'cause I'm walking you home. Like you need an excuse. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers, Merry Christmas. First family photo we ever put up. It's a good one. Yeah. She was really talented, wasn't she? Well, like I always say, you guys are a lot alike. You still wear your mom's necklace. What is it she always used to say? "Look up at the stars and..." "Know that I'll always be there." Yeah. I never take it off. You know, I just wanna thank you. You know, for all your support with this. Means a lot to me. Dad. I just want you to be happy. You know that. And I really like Helen. I'm excited for you to get to know her better. I know it's only been 10 months, but once we move in together. Is that what you and Mike were talking about earlier, about what to do with the house? Well, they just kinda need to know if, I'm gonna continue to rent after I move in with Helen, or... sell. Is that what you wanna do? Do you... do you wanna sell it? Well, I think it's something we both need to decide, right? I don't think so. I mean, I haven't been here in so many years. I don't... Hey. Hey. You know what? We... we don't have to talk about this right now. We have lots of time. Okay? Thanks. 'Kay. Want more tea? You know what, I think, I um, I'm beat. I think I'm gonna go to bed. Okay, honey. Okay. I love you. I love you too, babe. Jasper, hi. I was actually going to call you, to see if there are any... Updates? Well, there are. Good. Great. As I suspected, our chief editor loves your photos, but... She also loves three other submissions. There are three other people in the running still? Unfortunately, there was no clear-cut decision on who should get it, so we're giving all four of you the chance to resubmit. Same title and concept, but... I'm not in Boston, I'm on the Cape. Well, that's okay. It's the feeling of Christmas we're after. And everyone loves Cape Cod, so... You have until midnight on December 23rd to turn it in. I know it's a bit of a rush, but... Is it still for the staff position, too? It is, and editor's quirk, she wants to give someone a gift on Christmas. So, that's when we'll reveal which one of you we select. That's... Christmas. Something we haven't seen. Good luck. Thank you. All right. Christmas. Here. Whoo! Hi. Hi. I'm sorry to barge in like that. I'm wondering if that tour guide offer is still available. I know it's a bit of an odd req It's just, Boston, I know. But I have not been here since I was 17, and they've only given me three days to do it, and normally I'd take, like, a week to scout, and plan... Take this. It'll help. Thank you. All right. Okay. I'm sorry, it's... I thought I was done. You know? And now... You're starting over. But it's a really good opportunity. Yeah. It's just at a really bad time. And, it's doable though, right? I, yeah... Yeah. Wanna sit? Sure, yeah. Okay. You're saying you want to go see the old lighthouse? I know it's restricted, but I thought maybe you know somebody that could get me in? Yeah, I might. Really? I mean, I don't know if it's right. I just, it was the first place I thought of, so I figured I should at least check it out. Yeah, I mean, there are some pretty amazing views out there. I need amazing right about now. All right, then. In my opinion, you're in the perfect place for this assignment. Is that the tour guide talking? Tour guide voice. Yeah. So, 3:30? I'll take it. Okay. I love it. All right. It... it's... there you go. Thank you. Cheers. You know. Bye. Want one more? Here, I'll break it off. I can't get it. Here. I got it. - Hi. - Hi. Hey. You ready to go find the perfect tree? Yeah. Come on. Okay. How's that? Is that straighter? That's... doesn't sound good. Well, no, I think it's just the nature of the tree actually, Dad. I think it looks... good. It's... what I got for ya. Move over just a little bit, honey. Okay, it's... it's... it's fine. Helen, I can't believe you make your own ornaments. These? Well, feel free to use 'em, or not. I just had so many extra ones from my house that I picked out a few special ones from each year, and brought 'em over here. It sounds like so much work. No, I've been doing it since I was little. It just brings me so much joy. Plus, every single one of them is unique. Each one tells its very own special story. Maybe we could make some? Of course we can. Start our own tradition. Yeah. Just, maybe later, 'cause Mike's coming to get me soon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Guys, I'm so sorry I have to do this work stuff. Honey, no. That's okay. I know that's not how you want to spend your holiday, but... well, just go have fun. I'll try. Sorry, I gotta, I gotta straighten this tree. It's not working. It's not working for me. You ready to be inspired? Do you remember the picture my mom took of us up here? We were so proud of ourselves. Yeah, as we should be. A lot of stairs in there. Yeah. You beat me to the top. I did, really? Oh yeah. Yeah, I chased you the whole way. Well... She kept that picture on our mantle for... a lot of years. She did like me. Yeah. She did. They don't keep the key under the rock anymore. Surprisingly, they actually trust me with it. After you. Thank you. It's so cozy here. Yeah. Whoo! Yeah, these stairs have gotten steeper, huh? All right. Okay. So, what do you think? I mean, it's a little different in winter, but... it's usually a great view up here. Shame about the fog. If it weren't so remote, I'd bring the snowman out here. The... what? What are you talking about? Magic? Magic? You really don't know about the magic snowman? I don't, no. So, every night, for as long as I can remember, someone moves a giant snowman somewhere in town, for the week leading up to Christmas. And, why would someone do that? So that some lucky kids can find a magic snowman, ring the bell that he's holding, and make a wish? And is that somebody... you? Last five years, yeah. Pretty adorable. So, what do you think? Well, I was hoping to get the Christmas lights over on the hillside, but... I mean, with this fog, I don't think I can. I just think we're too far out. Yeah. I guess it's a good thing you know me. Now, what are you talking about? Well, I wouldn't be much of a tour guide if I only took you to one place, right? And, we're too far out, so... So? So maybe we just need to get a little closer to Christmas. So you have to throw a Christmas party every year for the Chamber of Commerce? Well, I... I volunteer to help every year, and securing a house for the Christmas party's just a part of it. They work really hard for the town, so it's nice that tonight they just get to celebrate. Well, this seems like the perfect place for it. You haven't seen nothing yet. Now this is Christmas on the Cape. This is amazing. Yeah. Well, you said you kinda needed it, so... Yeah. There you are. Hey. Hey, I was wondering when you were gonna show up. You're usually one of the first. Yeah, sorry about that. I was just helping Sam. Josh, you... you remember Sam, right? We never met, but he talked about you a lot. Did he? Yes, he did. Not a lot. This is my wife, Hannah. Hi. Hey, Hannah. I'm Sam. - Hi Sam. - So nice to meet you. You too. Officially. Okay, I promised that, I'd find the biscuits for my lovely wife, so... That's uh, that's British for "cookies." We've got cookies. See? You're already ready for your move to London. And I just want to let you know, my... boss's assistant will be giving you a call to set up that interview, so keep your phone close. All right. Thanks buddy, I appreciate it. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. You're moving to London? Yeah, well, I mean, it wouldn't be till the new year, if I even get the job. But, he works for a pretty big commercial leasing company. They handle a lot of the high rises in central London. Sounds exciting. No, I just... I don't know, I can't picture you anywhere else but here. I guess I was just looking for something new, you know? Fresh start. And busy's good. Yes. But hey, you, why don't you check out the party, and I'm gonna gather up the gifts for the toy drive. Toy... we're doing a toy drive? We're wrapping gifts that have already been collected. It's sort of a tradition at this party. People get real into it. Nice. But you, you gotta work, so go. Go focus. Yeah, I mean I'm pretty good at... at wrapping, so... All right. Well, if you finish early, you can jump in. How's that? Deal. See ya. Everybody gather round. It's present wrapping time. Okay, now I know that this isn't a "competition." But, whoever wraps the most gifts, all six sides covered, we know the rules, may or may not go home with all of the leftover cookies. Are all these gifts for the kids? Yeah. It's a good thing I came when I did. Done with your work already? No, but I'm ready to wrap. All right. I have to admit, I did not know the true value of double-sided tape until tonight. Yeah, you uh, you wrapped about a hundred presents in, what, ten minutes? It was for a good cause. And, you know what? If this whole photography career doesn't pan out... That's not gonna happen. You know what's funny? I grew up watching my mom take all of these amazing photos. It was so inspiring. And then I always pictured that I was going to be a freelance photographer when I grew up. Well, it looks like you... you nailed that. Yeah, you know what? I just... I don't know if I'm cut out for it. I feel like I should be doing something more practical. And that's what this staff position would be? It's a good opportunity. But to get it, I really need to wow them. Okay. Like, I need to get the first rays of dawn, against the last of the Christmas lights. You know what, I... I just, I need to capture that hope that only comes around once a year. That's... that's what I need. Why don't we stay here and see if you can capture it? I mean, we're here. Right? And if this is the view... I'm not gonna ask you to stay up with me all night. Why not? Look, I'm the guy who's gotta lock up, anyways. Mike. Why are you doing this? It's Christmas, isn't it? Right? And I like to help people. I don't buy it. Why are you doing this? Okay, fine. I know you don't want to talk about it. But I wasn't there for you when I should have been. You didn't know what was going on with my mom. It was... You know, it all happened so fast. Still, I know that this is just a small thing, but I'd really like to try and be here for you now. Let's get you that shot. Yes, yeah, of course. And, roger that. Is everything okay? As long as we're out of here before the cleaning crew arrive, we're good to go. You're amazing. Just you wait. What is that? That is enough ammo to keep a horse awake. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I guess we'll need it if we're gonna stay up till... sunrise. Yeah, About that. Light isn't going to change for a while, so... you wanna go see a snowman? Is he as heavy as he looks? No. I dunno. Then, yes. Gotta keep that magic alive, right? Yep. All right, so pick a side, either side. Sure. You just... yeah, reach in. Yep. Great. Yeah, he is light. Awkward, but light. How do you think I move him every night by myself? Just thought it was your superhuman strength. I should've gone with that. Okay. Okay, up, up, up. All right. Now let's just, find a good spot for him. Find? I can't make it too easy on the kids, right? Okay. I don't know. A snowman in front of an ice cream shop? Too cold. Yeah. Let's get him out of here. Which way? Let's go that... no, up... I mean, it's cute, but... Yeah, too obvious? Yeah. Well, get in there, though. Okay. Perfect picture opportunity. I see how it is. Love at first snow. Finally, I think he's actually good for tonight. I just can't believe you have the keys to this place. Yeah, well... I kinda help sponsor the kids' team. How will you ever leave this? You're practically the mayor of this town. I don't know about all that. Yeah, it'll be hard, but it can feel a little too small sometimes, too. You know? Got a lot of memories. It's cold. Come on, let's go. Here. Does your ex-wife still live here? No. No. She moved back to Ohio after the divorce. It's all good, in the grand scheme of things. You always do that, don't you? Do what? Make light of things? I guess I'm just an upbeat kinda guy. Yeah, you are. But... No, no, no. Look, it's fine. We were young, you know? We grew apart, wanted different things. I tried to adapt, make her happy, but... end of the day, it just didn't fix anything. Yeah, I just wish I had seen it coming. You know what, you can't do that to yourself. It's easy to get wrapped up. When's the last time you were? Wrapped up in a relationship? Yeah. I've never done that. Really? Okay. Yeah. You're messing with me. Yeah. All right, so when? A few years back. I thought he was the one. We both did. Which is why he turned down a job in LA. Eventually the guilt just kinda started chipping away at the relationship until there was nothing left, and suddenly he wasn't in my life anymore. I'm sorry. And after him? Hasn't really felt worth it since. Any of your relationships? No, yeah, no, I mean... Just, taking the chance in the first place. I'm kind of done with loss, so... I know it's hard but I think it's worth it, every time. Yeah. That's 'cause you're an upbeat kinda guy. Can I admit something? Sure. Okay. I wish that that one kiss we had, had happened at the beginning of the summer instead of at the end. Are you really going there? I'm serious. Well. I guess we both thought we had the next summer. Yeah, we did. But, hey, if any of that was different, then... maybe we wouldn't be here. Maybe you wouldn't be eyeing that job in London, which is very exciting, so... that's the upside. Look who's being upbeat now. You ready to get back to work? Yeah. You know what? You're gonna be just fine, whenever you go. This town, however? I don't think it's gonna do so well without ya. Just enough caffeine and chocolate to wake you up. Thank you. Did you get your shot? I think so? Awesome. Okay. How do you look so awake? I'm exhausted. It's adrenaline. You know? Luckily, I've got two more days to round it out, so... Are you feeling good? Yeah, I just gotta... I just gotta keep pushing through. Just gotta keep shooting anything and everything. But, I really do feel like I can breathe, so, thank you. Good. Well, if you do feel like taking a break, clearing your head, we're probably going to hit the rink later on. I know. You're gonna ice skate? Gotta throw the blades on at least once a year. I know it was work, but I had a lot of fun. Yeah, me too. London calling. All right. Do you have to get that? I mean, they're probably just setting up the appointment. Then you have to get that! I do. I do. I gotta get out anyway. You're right, you're right. Okay. Thank you. Hello. Uh, yes. Mike Phillips here. Thank you. Yes, Josh said that you'd be calling. You know, It's super festive, and there's so much more snow than I anticipated. Then we're basically having the same Christmas. Okay, so, did you see the other submissions. Yeah, but that was the first round. I have no idea what they're doing now. Right, right, but... they're mostly lights on buildings, sculptures, cityscapes, that kind of thing? And high concept, very artsy. Well, maybe they're all too similar. That's why they're having a hard time picking. You still have a little time, so just keep going. If it's Christmas they want... Well, then I got Christmas. Thank you. Talk soon, bye. Hey. You ready to go gather some pinecones? Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Let's do it. - Pine cones. - Pine cones. So, these are for ornaments? Wedding favours... to go along with the chocolate bells. Aww. Oh, well, good thing there are a lot of them out here. Do you remember how many hours you used to spend out here, playing by the creek? Yeah, and in it. Is it weird that I find it surprising how beautiful it is here in the winter? No, of course not. You haven't had a chance to experience it before. But it's special all year around, now that I'm retired I get a chance to enjoy it all the time. Why did we never come here for Christmas? You did- What? You did. Yeah. When you were five, you don't remember? No. Yeah. We were only here a few hours before the furnace went out. What? Yeah. We didn't have a rental, company back then, so no one was available to fix it. So, we just camped out by the fireplace. We camped? Yup. Three nights, right beside the tree. It was really sweet. Although, we decided to come only in the summer after that. No, it really is a magical place. Probably a bit more magical with a working furnace though, right? I'm so glad you're here. Yeah. I wasn't sure how hard it was going to be to come back, but... Me too. And I know that we still have to talk about what to do with the house, so... We can do that later. You keep saying that. Well, you haven't slept. You still need to hand in your assignment, so first thing's first, okay? 'Kay. Do we have enough? We got plenty. Okay, good. Thirty-five silver dusted pinecones, done. How's that reindeer coming? It's a snowman. Oh, is it? I knew that. Thank you. And, I think I'm done. Well then, you need to hang it on the tree. Okay... like here? Perfect. Our very first tradition. Good work. Did a great job. So you want me to put each one of these in one of those boxes? Yes, dear. But you know what? We have two full days to take care of all of this, you got plenty of time. Well, that's why I'm so excited to fill these little boxes. Hey, we have to go to the hotel to do a couple last minute things. So, if you wanna come along... Hey, Mike? I might need that break. Well done. Hey. I have to admit, I didn't see him at first. So, well done. I have to admit that I had help. I don't think I was of much help, but it was fun. Well, you'll have fun out there, too. Are you guys leaving? Yeah. 'Cause right now, we got some hot chocolate to drink. - Bye. - Bye. The ice is calling. Let's do this. I have not done this in years. Okay, you can't tell, 'cause your... your... your form is... perfect. Alright, just give me a minute to practice. Okay. Hey, Tell me this, what would you do? Well that's that's a very broad question. Yeah. About my Dad's house. You're the property guy. Would you sell? Would you rent? That's a very personal question. Yeah, I just don't know. You know, I mean, had you asked me a week ago, I would've said sell. But now? Not sure. Well, probably wait until you do know, 'cause once it's gone you're never going to get it back. So, what do you say, do a little backwards skate? What? No, no. No, no, that's... No, no, that's a terrible idea. That's... It's easy. Put your butt down. I don't wanna. Do a little spin? Woah! Woah! You're crazy! I take that as a compliment. Mike, I can't. I'm so sorry. No, no, no. I... Our timing's off. No, I... I... it's just, I know. I was just... look, I'm... I'm... yeah, I'm sorry. But just so you know, I do wish that that kiss had happened earlier, too. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Power lap. I'm gonna race ya. I'm gonna... I'm gonna win. Okay. I mean, you're gonna lose. Whoo, well, probably going to be sore tom but worth it. Yeah? Glad you took a break? Spent so much time with my mom in there. It's actually where I realized I wanted to do this. Be a photographer? It's also where she found out... She was sick. Just makes it really hard to go back in, you know? I'm sure it does, but... If you avoid it all together, you know, you're avoiding all the good memories, too. Yeah. Let's just see if I can get this photography thing going. Then let's finish strong. This event is... it's different. Okay? But there's gonna be people, a lot of faces. Oh no, I usually do landscapes and cityscapes. I know, I know, but... this is Christmas, right? Christmas is all about people. True, yeah. Meet me here in the morning? That all you're gonna tell me? See you in the AM. Okay, so it's a Christmas fair. Nope. Are you seriously not going to tell me why we're here? You're just gonna have to wait for it. Want a cocoa? No, are you serious right now? They have coffee. I didn't say you'd have to wait long. Come on. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! What? Oh, my gosh. This is amazing. Worth the wait? Definitely. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Aw. Now I really don't know how you're going to give all this up. Me neither. I got... I'm just gonna... Yeah. Not quite done? No. I'm, I'm almost done, I just... this is so different from what I normally do, and I feel like he really liked my initial direction, so I just... But he had you redo it, right? That's a good point, yeah. I don't know, I just feel like this is... So different than where I started. The light of Christmas, that's the title. Right? So, it... it's different for everyone. It's personal. That's what makes it special. So, as long as your light is coming through, I don't think you can go wrong. Good work. I... I've never seen anything like this tree. Well, I warned you that it might be a little bit over the top. No, it's beautiful. In fact, your whole house is beautiful. Well, it's a little bit different than your dad's place, but we're happy here. Yeah. I think it's perfect. Thanks for coming over, Sam. Here, let's sit down. I want to talk to you about something important. Sure. I know that I would have loved your mother. I mean, she sounds like such an amazing woman. And I'll never try to take her place, or what you guys had. And I want you to know how lucky I feel to be marrying into this family. So, I'm just hoping that maybe you'll be my maid of honour. Me? There's nothing extra you have to do, I promise. And I've already set a couple dresses aside, just in case. But, it's so important for me to have you be a part of this. I'd love to. Really? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I am so happy. Are you still up for helping me finish those wedding favours? I am, I am, yes. Let's go. Okay. It sounds like an incredible opportunity, and a... a pace that I'd definitely be up for. Great. I look forward to hearing from you. How'd it go? Good. Good. I mean, he's gonna get back to me later on today. But. Yeah, it went... went pretty well. Are you sure? You don't look like it did. I don't know. It's a lot to process. Well, you've always been decisive. So I think you just gotta figure out what it is holding you back, and go from there. I've never done moulds before, but I have been baking gingerbread waffles every Christmas morning since I was about nine, so... if you're interested... I will definitely be there. So I heard you got some good pictures of Santa today. Oh, yeah. You know, the whole thing was just amazing. Well, it's always more special when you share it with someone you care about. Yeah. Wait, do you mean Mike? No, no. No, we... We're friends. Old friends. We're old friends, so, but... Any... Anyway, he's thinking about moving, so... Yeah, but he's here now. Yeah, but you know? You know what, I think it's just... our timing was always off. When we were kids, and then again now. But something tells me that those feelings are still there. Smells amazing in here. Hey, there's my groom. So now I think it's time to celebrate. We're gonna be celebrating plenty tomorrow. Yeah, you and I, but this is for Sam. For me? Why? Well, you turned in your assignment. Didn't you? Yeah. I'm not gonna hear if I get the job till Christmas day, though. But you gave it everything you got, and that's all that matters. So? Gourmet hot chocolate at the hotel? What do you say? Are the carollers there? Yeah, so we better hurry, or we might not get a spot. Apparently, it's kind of a thing. Okay. I just wanna try one of these for the road. What? She's the boss. She says no. Those are for the wedding. Okay, okay. We'll get some later, right? When we get back. Let's go. I don't know how they're possibly going to add more decorations for tomorrow. I'm sure they could fit a few more poinsettias in here. Definitely. Your timing seems pretty good to me right now. So, that is why it is important for us to be able to promote local artists. So almost everyone that you see in here, is either from here or lives here. Umm... Won't you excuse me for a moment please? Hi. Hi. You must be Elizabeth's daughter, Samantha. Right? Forgive me. As I'm looking at you, it's like staring right at her. You think so? I never thought so. Thank you, that's nice to hear. We spent so much time in here. You remember? Yes, I do. It actually inspired me to follow in her footsteps. Well, your mom was very talented. I used to always want her to submit more of her work. But, she made it very clear. Life came first. You guys. Really? That's what made her work so beautiful. And that is also what I will remember most about her. Please, won't you have a seat? I've been wanting to come in here for days, but... I know. It was hard. Listen. I know that it's been a long time, but I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you. But I'm so glad that you share the same passion, and the same love of art. Like your mom. And you can see her in everything you do. And that is a gift. Yeah. It is. Listen, I'd love it if you would like to bring in your work sometime. I would be more than happy to take a look at it. Thank you. That means the world. I'm really glad you came in. Excuse me. Yeah. Okay, so I know we're still putting the deal together. But congrats on the job! This is great, right? Yes. Yeah. Thank you. Look man, I owe you. But... What? It's just... look. You know that I would love to work with you again. You... you don't wanna move? I don't think so, no. I get it. You do? It's a lot to leave. Yeah. I mean, my family, and you know, this town. And the rest of it. What? Hey. I've seen you fall for a few girls through the years. Sam's the only one you've fallen for twice. It's... What? You talked about her. A lot. When I left, I had a whole lot to move for. Hannah was there, work, family. Everything you love is here. Okay, everything except me. I won't be here, but... So yeah. I get it. Thanks, man. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hi, Dad. Yeah, I'm so sorry to bother you, but the um, it's leaking. The ceiling is leaking again. Okay. Yep. I'll... You call the handyman, I'll get a bucket. Okay, bye. That'll do. Right. Help has arrived. I'm so glad you're back. Did you get a handyman? Well, I got a not-so-handyman that's very helpful. All right. Let's fix this. I found this- - in the attic from our first Christmas here. And then I found this, that I made for Mom here, remember? I remember this. I just think there are so many memories here, and... I don't want to let them go. Me either. Really? Yeah. Who else is going to come and play in the creek, or come for Christmas? Huh? All right, this time, definitely fixed. Are you sure we shouldn't call a professional? Hey, I'm a professional jack-of-all-trades. Is that even a thing? Are you sure this wasn't just an excuse to get back here? Dad! I mean, I'm just saying. Look. I think there was a... a second leak that I didn't see the first time. But it's definitely all patched up now. Good. 'Cause we're keeping the house. You are? All right, thanks for coming by Mike. Take care of yourself. See you tomorrow, sir. I am so sorry. He's kind of embarrassing sometimes. It's fine. I really did try and fix it last time, though. I'm glad it happened. 'Cause it gave me a chance to ask you in person. Ask me what? If you wanted to be my date to the wedding. I know. I know what you said about my leaving. And I... I get it. I've been thinking a lot, and I don't think this is the right time for me to move anyways. You're not going to London now? Okay... Does it have anything to do with... With... No, us? No. No. Okay. No. Like you said, this place is hard to leave. And... I mean, who else is gonna move the snowman next year? Right? So, what do you say? I don't know. I mean, I'm kinda in the wedding now, so... Is that a no? No. Just means you're gonna have to meet me there. Awesome. Bye. Right this way. And you can set up in there, and we'll be right in. Thank you. You ready for some pampering? I am, I am, but you really don't have to do this. It... it's your big day. I wanted to. Aw.... Well, I wanted to get you something, too. You didn't have to get me anything. But thank you. I know I'm not the most seasoned maid of honour, but... I'm pretty sure you need something old. That's beautiful. That is beautiful. I actually made it for my mom. When I was like ten. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, you know... We're really lucky to have found you, too. Well, let's... Yeah. Let's... let's do this. Let's also consider it something borrowed. Because I look forward to when I can give it back to you. 'Kay. Okay, so other than handing them the rings... Just enjoy the moment. Take it all in, and keep your father relaxed. What? I'm relaxed. Well, your guests are here, so I'm just going to make sure everyone is seated. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. So? Are you nervous? Well, I kind of thought I would be, but no, I'm... I'm good. How about you? Same. That makes me happy. Yeah. Me too. It's time. You ready? Yeah? I'm ready. Okay. Let's do it. I do. I do. Okay, so, admittedly, this was my first Christmas wedding. I thought it was pretty perfect. I agree, but I'm biased, so... I guess here's to the rest of the night being perfect as well? Woah! You a professional dancer now, too? How would you tell? No. You know what, I have to go help set up some bridal photos, so... What? They hired another photographer? Cute. I think they've had enough of me working for a while. Good. Okay, well, I'll grab some appetizers. Meet you back at the table. Sure. I'm gonna go. Okay. Like, right now. Okay. Okay. Hi. Hi! If there are any specific family photos you want to get, let me know, otherwise she's just gonna do candids. I think candids sound great. Sam? Yeah. No, I love candids. Great. I just need to grab you for one more thing. Hey, you did an excellent job out there. Well, thanks. We're so happy you guys could make it. So are we. Yeah. And I have to say, we're pretty glad he's not moving. I bet you are. Yeah. It was a pretty big opportunity, so, he must really like you. Yeah... no, no, he's not staying for me. He's staying for the town, and for you guys. Yeah, yeah, well, you know, he likes to keep everybody happy. That's true. But hopefully we'll see a lot more of you. Yeah. If my favourite Christmas music wasn't enough, there's gonna be sparklers too. Come on. Hey. Hey. Sorry I took so long. I had to ask your dad a rental question, just 'cause it's, like, time sensitive. But, I did manage to get the good apps before they were taken. Thank you. Are you okay? I think you should go. You wanted to go. Is... is this about London? That was... that was just an offer. It was an opportunity, and it was a really, really good one. Are you... are you trying to get rid of me already? That's, no, that's not what I'm... Did they say something? I know that there are probably many different reasons that you would want to stay here. Your family, the town, and us, but... before I came back, you wanted to go, right? You... you... you wanted to go and do something new for yourself. I... I did, but... And I think you should do that. Right? Mike, this is about what makes you happy. So, what are you saying? I don't want you to have any regrets. You're just assuming that I would. Because I've been here before. You know you don't think that you're gonna be giving anything up in the moment, but then over time, it just... I don't want that. For either of us. Why are you trying to sabotage this? I'm not, I just... think our timing is off. Again. Look, I get it. Okay? We've... we've both lost. But you can't hide behind that forever. You can't always take the safe way out because you don't want to risk anything. Pfft. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to cut the cake. I gotta... Sam. ...get back in there. Sam. I'm gonna... Now, some of these are a little silly But, I hope you like 'em. We're gonna love them, but... I wanna do this one. Let's do it. Merry Christmas. Guys, I told you not to get me anything. I know, but it's important to us. What is this? This is about the house. You signed the house over to me? What? Helen and I really want you to have the house. And I know your mother would want you to have the house, too. Guys, I don't even... I don't... Thank you. I don't know what to say. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. It's so nice to have you here. Thank you. You know, I think this might be the first time ever that you haven't devoured your donut before we left the café. Hey, well, if you don't want it, I can always... All right, never mind, I don't want it. You feeling okay? Yeah, no, I... I just didn't sleep much last night. Is this about Sam? Well, what about Sam? Did I mess things up by mentioning that... Dad. You were just stating a fact, you know? It was a good opportunity, but... It's all good. No it's not all good. Not even a little. No. No. She's amazing. I can't believe you worked with Mike on this. He said you guys were talking about rental stuff. Yeah, he knew a guy that could help us out last minute to get it done. Of course he does. He's a good guy. Is that? Is it? It's from Vanessa. What does it say? "Have you checked your email?" Let's check. I don't know, Dad. I'm trying, I'm trying. It must be a large file. Okay, thank you for capturing the guiding light of Christmas. You got it. You got it? I got it. You got it! You got it! I got it! You got it! Yes! You got it! Does that mean you get the job, too? Yeah, I mean, I guess so, yeah! If I want it, yeah. I had a really good tour guide, didn't I? You had an excellent guide. Sweetie? You deserve love as well as success. I gotta go. Yeah, I gotta go! I'm sorry. What? I had to give you this. Every tour needs a souvenir, right? This is mine. I'm so sorry about yesterday. No. I'm scared. I don't want to miss out on our chance again. 'Cause this is what I want. All of it. And you helped me see that. Well then, that would be pretty awful to walk away from. Did you... ...get the job? Yes. Yeah. Of course you did. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Congrats. Thanks. Okay, does that mean that you need to... Get back? Yeah. No. So? You're gonna keep freelancing? Well if... if I'm staying, and you're just gonna roll with it, then, uh? Looks like our timing is improving. Yeah, it's about time. You ready for the final stop on our tour? Yeah. Okay, so, it's a choir? Nnn... not exactly. Come on, are you really not gonna tell me again? I promise you it is worth the wait. If the bells are ringing, does that mean I get to make a wish? Absolutely. Merry Christmas.
