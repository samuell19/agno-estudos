THE STALLION AND THE GAZELLE THE STALLION AND THE GAZELLE This is Shuick! This is Zohommm! I wonder if stars really have little points? No, that's due to our astigmatism, it's an optical illusion caused by irregularities of the cornea. My optometrist says that mild astigmatism is normal and keeps us from seeing stars as round points of light Your optometrist has ruined the joy of looking at the stars for me.

It is violence to sterilize people as has been done in India and Bolivia, it is violence to oppress people by plundering their natural resources, by compelling them to live in misery. The day that our people accept the principle that imperialism by its very nature is violent, they will know how to justify physical violence rationally as contestation. One of the most important struggles of the Third World is the struggle to legalize violence, for the West has convinced the people that violence is bad." ZOHOMMM - What should we do?

I could go away and live alone, but, really in history, I would lose Either kill one and leave the other two or one kills himself and the two others remains or one goes. Killing is also a problem. That's also a difficult solution The best solution, even in this situation, is really to stick together always. Perhaps we can change the mentality with time. I don't know if I expressed that well.
