-Nam, I want to join you. -Pau-pee. Are you not going to school again? Why should I go? We have an English test today. I don't know English, so it's best to stay away. -How about Chow-pee? -My brother? There, he's courting a girl right now. Do you want some ice-cream? Kid, come here! How dare you play here on my court? I only know that it's under the Urban Council's supervision. Who are you? I live in block 13. That means you're not in any triads. My name is Kwan. Tomorrow, give me a red pocket. Give you? Do you despise me? Let me say this again, give me a red pocket. Or else, each of you will get a bottle. I'll hit you whenever I see you again. Stop it! Stop it! Fatty, do you want to leave? Come on! Stop! -Stop! -Beat them up! -Stop! -Hit them with all your might! -Stop it! -Hit them! Kwan, you don't have to go so far. They are just kids. Hey! Mr. Bee! I'm just giving them a lesson on how to behave properly. Hit harder! They are just kids, let them go! Stop! All right, I'll listen to you. Stop that! Hey, cut it off! Mr. Bee, I received an order to do something, so I want you to lend me some boys. Let's talk about it later. Great! How is it, kid? Are you all right? If you want to be good, go home and study. Don't ever come here again. If you come here to play football, tell them that you know Bee. Kelly. Do you want some milk? No, thanks. Why not? It's Ho-nam's treat. He should come here himself then, you're not helping one bit. -Really? -Also, please tell him this. Don't pass me notes during class again. Pass you notes? Hey, did you pass her notes? It's not good! It's so cheesy! -Right? -I couldn't even finish watching As Tears Go By last night. Andy Lau is so cool. I think so too! You bring bad luck! I think Maggie Cheung is good. -Let's go and finish it now. -Let's go now. Let's go. -They're following us. -Let's walk faster. Hey, Kelly! Hey, let me give you a ride home. You won't have to wait for the bus. No, thanks. Don't be alarmed, I'm a nice guy. I just want to be friends with you. What's the matter? It's none of your business, get lost! What are you looking at? You're only a kid, just drink your milk! Kelly is our class prefect, pay some respect. -She's also a girl, are you insane? -Why are you here? -What's wrong? -It's nothing. We're leaving now. Goodbye, Mr. Hung. Go home, boys. -What's the matter? -It's nothing. Are you trying to be cool? As a student, please just study and don't make any troubles. -Understood, Mr. Hung. -Understood. Watch out! Hey, beat Piggy to death! You are dead, Piggy! Piggy! You better eat shit, you Piggy! Where is Chicken? His things are here, but where is Chicken? I don't know. Is Nam insane? Whenever you can't get your girl, you will act like that. I haven't experienced that, how would I know? Go home and masturbate on your own! My nuts are waiting for you! Come here! Aren't they waiting? Don't come over! Don't you dare come over! What were you doing? I didn't want to waste time, so I did something first. What were you doing? This is Chocolate. We were practicing the Flute Stance. "Flute Stance"? Damn you, Chicken! Another girl? It's a musical instrument. -What do you know? -You bastard! -Watch me! -No, I don't want to! -Come here. -No! Let's practice for tomorrow's singing contest! GROWING UP IS TO NEVER FAIL YOUR YOUTH, COMMITTING IS URGING YOURSELF! Kelly, Ho-nam composed a song for you. Really? I didn't know that. Come on, everyone knows that Ho-nam is falling for you. Tell him to stop dreaming. She is rich and decent, who does he think he is? Not bad, they are talented. JUDGE Stop! Stop singing! Why did you stop us? What did you just sing? Principal, this is music. Do you know creativity? What is it? I just heard screaming and I understand what the lyrics mean. You are scolding both the school and its teachers! Head backstage now and see me in my office later. What did we do wrong? This is a singing contest. You didn't stipulate what we should and should not sing. Why can't you accept rock music? I am the principal, not you. -I said no and that's it. -What did you say? See? They are supporting us. You! Come down right now! What's the matter? -Weren't you dismissed from our school? -I was. -Why are you here? -I came back for the band. Let's go. This is not the right school for you. We don't welcome bad students like you! Sorry, sir. I promise it won't happen again. That's right, if you don't like it, we won't sing that song again. However, please give us a chance. Fine, I'll consider it. Let's go. -Here! -Here! Why can't you study hard? Hard work will pay off instead. I've always preferred a poetry recitation to a singing contest. I'm happy to leave the school! Our dad won't let us go! Take this back! Run! -Hey! -Run! -Hey! -Hey! Get lost! Hit him! Come here, you! POLICE -Don't move! -Don't move! -Hey! -It's the police! -Stop right there! -It's the police! -Sir, we are the victims. -Squat down! -Come on! Squat! -We're the victims, sir! Squat! I'm telling you to squat! -Squat! -Just do it already! -Move faster! -Faster! -Lower your head and walk! -Move! -Keep walking! -Move! You bastards are all under arrest. Why don't you play music instead of fighting? -Don't move! -Go inside the van! Dude, will we have a criminal record? You will receive a ten-year sentence. Are you bluffing? Shut up, we'll interrogate you after this. Who is your boss? I'm not a triad member. You're not a member, so why did you fight? I'm not a triad member, but I am a student, sir. I caught many triad members who have claimed to be students before. Aren't you a triad student? I was beaten, but I'm not a triad member, sir! Do you take me for a fool? Tell me where you live. -Block 13, Nam Tin. -Louder. Block 13, Nam Tin. Let me advise you, we have the rights to detain you for 48 hours. If no one bails you out, you'll enjoy the holidays here. You're Chan Ho-nam, I know you pretty well. Are you threatening me? You ignorant kids! You are nobody! Listen, don't let me see you ever again, or I will teach you a good lesson. You won't be that lucky next time to be saved by the police. Do you get me? You bastard! -Let's fight one-to-one! -You idiot! What's the matter? What? I've always called you a fool. I love gang fight, many-to-one, you know? -Beat him up! -Bastard! -Help! -Hey! What's the matter with you? This place is not a carnival! This is a police station! No, sir. We just wanted to play a game, but now it has stopped. -It's no longer fun. -Chu Wai-chau. -Yes! -Someone has come to bail you out. Thank you, sir. My boss has come to bail me out, so you can just rot here. Sir, I'm coming. -Chan Sai-kit. -Yes. -Hung Fai! -Yes. -Cheung Kwok-ming. -Yes. -Wong Chi-kit. -Yes. Come out if your name is called. Thank you, sir. Do you want to play tricks? Bee, why are you here? Did you commit any crime? Coming here doesn't mean that I've committed anything. You are here every day, right? I dare not despise your triad members. You guys are eloquent at times. I came to bail a few kids out. Just be good for once. What's the matter, Officer Ox? Officer Chan, I have come to bail a few kids out. What are their names? Chan Ho-nam, Pao Tak-ming, and Pao Tat-yee. Thank you, sir. You should teach them a lesson. As their boss, this is my job. Do you want to teach them for me? Bee, you're so nice to the police. Do you want to cooperate with them? Same as you, I came to pay the bail for the kids. I've just finished, so I'm currently waiting for them. -Boss. -Hi, Piggy. Is everyone here? Kwan, your kids were no match for mine. They ruined your reputation. Piggy, is that the truth? Of course not! We were just warming up when the police arrived. You bastard, I can tell that you're lying. You've tainted my name. Well, listen to me! Dark Girl paid 500 dollars for every one of you in advance. No matter how, you should pay me back the money. -Okay? -Did you get that? Kwan, as their boss, you can't even afford to bail them out? Well, I can afford it. Bee, you are rich and righteous! See, here is a great example for you all. Thank you. Here. Didn't you tell me that you're not a triad member? Your boss just came to bail you out. Thanks. Is this Bee's turf? No, this is Bee's boxing school. But no one is practicing. Do you know what time it is? It's two o'clock. Boss. This is Big Head. Chicken's senior. Introduce yourself. Hi, Big Head. I'm Pau-pee. Chow-pee. Boss, are you recruiting us as your boys? I paid the bail for Chicken's sake. Look at you, you're students! Do you want to follow me? Let me consider first. My guess is you won't remember me when you wake up tomorrow. We are not triad members, but the police think we are. Hey, you look better than me. Whenever I walk into Tsim Sha Tsui East, I'll be questioned by the police four times. Four times? You look suspicious indeed. I can't get rid of the ink mark. If you want to get rid of it, you can. Just try. The toilet is over there, go wash your hands and eat. Do you know your way? Why is it so hard to remove it? Bastard. You moron. It's really hard to remove it. I've had it. Take your time. Ho-nam, come out for noodles! Which one do you want? Anything will do. I saw a beautiful girl inside the toilet. Really? Where? I didn't see or smell any beauty around. Is it Fei, Big Head's girlfriend? Boss. Girl, are you picking up your boyfriend? Yes. Fei, you look really pretty today. Let's shake hands. Boss, I'll go first. Is that the girl? I saw her crying in the toilet. That's ridiculous, she has always been very cool. -No one has ever seen her cry. -How did you know? Everyone here knows that. Will you introduce her friends to me? I want to have such a cool girl as a girlfriend. Just eat your noodles and shut up. All right. Eat the beans and just shut it. Were you crying? No. Who did you just call? Would you leave me alone? Am I even your boyfriend? My ex-boyfriend died. Are you satisfied now? It's not true. Anyway, just don't ask. You kid, stay where you are! -What do you want? -Don't move. Are you a triad member? Why did you come to the first block? I live in block 13. Block 13? It means you're not a member. I'm a Hung Hing Boy! I want to rob you! Take everything out, hurry up! Take the money, but don't assault us. Piss off. You bastard, how dare you fool me! Are you looking for trouble? It hurts! No! Do you want me to kill you? It's just for fun. Why are you so mean? Serves you right! The guy was so afraid that he gave me everything. He gave me his wallet, phone, watch, everything! You're really tough. Do you see yourself as a real gangster? When did you start following Bee? Last Christmas. I went to a party, then someone assaulted me. Coincidentally, I met Bee there. He saved me, so I decided to be under his wings. Didn't he ask you to recruit any fellows? Even if someone wants to, it doesn't mean that he would like it. You know, this thing involves two parties. It's not like wooing girls, in which you'd just flatter and screw. Nam, now that we have quit school, why don't we... Pau-pee? Me? I'll go with the flow. If they follow you, then I'll do the same. Where's your brain? -Stop that! -Let me enjoy this first. -Chicken, what the hell? -What did you just do? How dare you! I'm Chicken, come out! Hey, come out! Nam, our block and block 16 are not under any triad's supervision. If we follow Bee, then the whole Block 13 will be under us. Do you think becoming a triad member means getting rich that you don't have to work? -We can court as many girls as we like. -You can find a prostitute too! Do you want me to kill you? -I'm sorry! -Hey. Big Head's girlfriend who we saw at the boxing school looks great. Isn't she? Damn it, she is not your girl! So what? Think of it, she's really great. Hello? Hello, this is Chan Ho-nam. What's wrong? Well, I just want to know who won the singing contest. New Kid in Town won the contest. You're kidding. That's another rock band. Hello? Who are you? This is Chan Ho-nam, madam. I see, you're the bad boy who was kicked out of school. -Mom. -Be quiet. Let me tell you this, don't you ever call again. Or else, I'll call the police. Mom. Kelly, be a good girl. I am Chicken of the Hung Hing Group, come out! You better shut your damn mouth, bastard! She is great! It's wonderful! Why? Haven't you seen a beauty before? Damn it, you bastard! -Are you human? Is your mother a bitch? -Don't come over! -Why don't you go to hell? -Hey! -Granny! -Goodness, Chicken! -Do you want to bump me to death? -I saw a ghost. -A ghost? -Yes, the ghost just passed by! It was so ugly! -Where is Ho-nam? -I don't know, do you trust me? -Not really. -I'll help you. Let me help you. Look, this guy is so ugly. Look at how ugly he looks. Just take the money. -Why? -Throw the wallet into the mailbox. Why not throw it into the trashcan? Throw it into the mailbox, so he can get it back. Next time if you lose your way home, just jump into the mailbox, all right? It's too small for me. Ho-nam! Granny. -Granny. -Why didn't you go home after school? I'll be right back! I'm having a little chat! Go home. I don't mind you smoking. You can smoke at home. Your mother called many times. Remember to give her a call. Okay. I've deposited money into your account. If you want to buy the microwave oven, buy it. Great! Last time I picked up Dee from school, I saw that it was on sale. Brother! -Is it a holiday? -Yes. Have you been good? -Yes. -Yes. It's late. Why aren't Mui and Dee home yet? They must be on their way. I'm going to work now. -Here. -It's okay, I'll do it myself. Dee, who were you playing with? Big brother Ho-nam. Mom. Mui, go inside. Here. -Ho-nam, I'm glad to see you. -Mom. Come inside and eat. Ho-nam, can you walk me downstairs? I have something to talk to you. -Hung. -It's all right, just a little chat. I know that you dislike me. I know that you dislike me too. Wrong, I married your mom and I don't mind having a stepson. I work in an ambulance and I always see people dying. You're old enough! It doesn't matter if you don't live with your mom. I don't mind you not respecting me, but I'll always be your stepdad. Mom told me that you were the one who took my dad with the ambulance. Your dad was a triad member. He was badly injured. Your mom stayed next to him in the ambulance and cried badly. She became a widow the next time I saw her. Then, I won her heart over and we got married. You have seen many triad members, right? Go up and have some soup. She loves you very much. It's okay to quit school. I just don't want you to be half-dead when I see you in my ambulance. Go back. Your mom's soup is the best in the world. Here, have more. Thank you, Mom. Mui, go inside and do homework with your brother. -Okay. -Okay. What happened? Are you dismissed from school? The principal is insane. He has no reason to do that. If you don't study, what can you do? Mom, I'm already 17 years old. You're only 17 years old. Well, I'm leaving now. Nam! It's not a wise choice to be a gangster. I don't want you to follow your dad's path. I know how to take care of myself. THE WORLD IS CRUEL AND FAMILY IS PRECIOUS, NOT EVERYONE CHOOSES THE RIGHT PATH! NAM, DRINK THE SOUP GRANNY There were so many people at the temple this morning. Have you finished the soup? Granny, I quit school. I have found a job. I'll work in a garage. They provide accommodation and food. So I won't come back anymore. That's good. I don't have to wake up at night just to make you soup. I can finally have a good sleep. Granny. Come on. Can you tell me how Dad was killed? Those people were cruel and fierce. The police told me that he was slashed 47 times. It was 47 times! Why did you let Dad be a gangster? Your dad was illiterate. He didn't want to work as a worker for the rest of his life. He just wanted to make more money. As his mom, I couldn't stop him from doing it. Don't worry, Granny. I know how to take care of myself. Even if I choose the same road in which Dad took... I will be different from him. If you have the time, go to Macau to visit your dad's grave. This morning, I've got an oracle from that temple for you. It's a good one. You will be fine. While this is a safety charm. Can you please keep it? Thank you, Granny. Don't worry. I am old enough. Remember to hold your temper. Don't argue with your colleagues and friends. Take good care of yourself! I'm going, Granny. Mr. Bee, I wish to follow you. -Madam Bee! -Madam Bee! Sit down. Why are all of you so polite? Man, Keung, say hello to Ho-nam. -Hello, Ho-nam. -Hello, Ho-nam. Chicken. This is Chow-pee and this is Pau-pee. Your name is disgusting. How dare you tease me. I'll cut your dick off! -Come on, cheers! -Cheers! -Big Head! -Big Head! -Bottoms up, you fatty. -All right. Time is different now. In the past, a boss controls your life. Although you have quit school, you can still update yourself. He knows English! Do you want us to study at evening schools? You'll only waste your time by chasing girls there. Learn driving and boxing. You may not win with your fists, so you'll need your brains as well. It's time to eat, just cut the crap. This is your favorite. Great. Also, learn how to respect women. -Did you get that? -We did. Or else, you'll never find a woman. You'll have to find a prostitute instead. Chicken, behave. All right, but I really respect you! Boss, let's drink. You really love talking back. What the hell is this? Stop kicking me! Mr. Bee! Is this a family gathering? Everyone needs to eat, unless you are not a human. I heard that you've recruited these kids. We're a family now, so please look after them if necessary. Boss, do you know him? He is Chan Ho-nam. Well, have you screwed that girl yet? -What are you saying? -Don't you understand? I'm saying that she doesn't like you at all! He must have cried for three days and nights. She doesn't like you either. -So what? You bastard. -What did you say, fatty? What the hell! -What's the matter? -What's wrong? Do you want me to lose my reputation? We are a family! Piggy, what's the matter? Do you want girls? Don't you have enough? No, I just want to recruit a few for our brothels. Bee, I am sorry, they need to be taught a lesson. I'll teach them accordingly. But you better teach yours, they need a lesson too. Mr. Kwan, I know what I have to do. Let's not bother them, come on! We'll eat in the air-conditioned section. Waiter, bring us ten bowls of shark-fin soup! -Faster! -Right! Listen, boys. We have become Bee's followers, so we can't come here anymore. Why? This is a good place to play music. No one would complain about the loud noise. Stop thinking about the band. I worry that we will only fight in the future. Do you really think that we're singers? -Aren't we? -We are gangsters. I want to be a hero! I want to be a boss. How about being a lady boss? -I want you to be a concubine! -Hey! Get lost, you bastard! GOODBYE -I, Chan Ho-nam. -I, Chicken. -I, Pau-pee. -I, Chow-pee. From this moment onwards... There will be no separation. We will share our happiness. We will share our troubles and we will share our food too. -That's great! -Good! See you! See you then! Goodbye. Twenty-seven! Can you make it quicker? Why don't you practice boxing? What? How dare you beat my brother? Hey, what are you doing? I'll give you a coffin! It's a bird, you love it. This is for you, bastards! The triad members! Here's the West piece! West! To hell with you! -Do you want some peanuts? -I have some. -Go! -Let's go! Not for us. We are the Great Four. We don't go unless it's necessary! The Great Four? People only see us like four sperms. Listen, you sperm! I am a sperm and you're an egg. -You look cool, Ho-nam! -Go! TODAY'S WORLD Where are we going? We are going to have a negotiation. Why didn't we have any weapons? We don't need weapons. We just need to talk, not fight. Have you come to such a place before? No, I'm not even 18 yet. Aren't we having a negotiation? I'll do it, not you! This is my place, enjoy yourself. What are you looking at? Move it! Big Head, show them to the sofa. I'll go with Bo to talk to Bill. You know this place very well, don't you? Get some girls for them. -Pau-pee, come here. -Okay. This way. So grand! Of course, this is the Boss's place. This is so cool! Take a seat. The girls here have big breasts and they are very pretty. Really? Hey, May will scold me. -Hey. -Are you kidding? Are you afraid of being scolded by May? You scold her instead! Keep some savings and you'll be healthy. Gambling is not that bad. It's better than giving money to your mother-in-law. You're really corny. Boss taught us that. They don't seem to be having a negotiation. Do you mean that guy? That guy is Bill. He is from Tung Sing. There is a construction site named Tung Fung Garden in Chai Wan. Boss has taken over half of the renovation business. And the rest goes to the Tung Sing boys. God knows that guy never follows the rules. And he dared to tell others that it's Tung Sing's turf. They don't respect Hung Hing at all. My buddies and I have run the renovation business for over 20 years. From the Western District to Chai Wan, I've contributed so much in this field. You and the Hung Hing Boys are powerful these days, but it doesn't mean that you are good in every field. Handsome boys, we've got beautiful girls here! I know you love those with big breasts. So, this is yours. Bravo! Come on! What about me? Hey, don't worry. Come on. Yan-yee, faster. -You're giving her to me? -Sit here. She's very attentive. This is Boyboy. May I know your name? Big Head. Fei has some clients over there. She'll come back later. Take another girl, okay? She knows I'm here? Of course! You know her very well. She doesn't express much on her face. If famine happens, we can eat your head for three days and three nights. Your head is great! Did you wash your hair? -Did you have a fight? -See that? -No. -Come, let's drink. -Hey, enjoy yourself. -Bottoms up. Be nice, okay? My name is Yan-yee, what's your name? -You are Yan-yee? -Yes. I think you should be called Fatty. You are fat! Did you hear that? -You're so mean! -Just kiss! Have a kiss! -No! -You're the worst! Don't assault me! Let's play the guessing game. -I don't like playing guessing games. -Well, show me your palm. Give me! Let's see. Let me measure it! What? Hey, he has a small penis! -What? -Hey, his penis is this long! -What? -How about mine? Wow, his penis is this small! So that's what you think of me. My palm is fake. I... Let me show you! -Wait, let me get it. -Can you even get it? I put it right here. I came to say hello, my client has booked me. I told you I'll come. I forgot to bring my pager. Well, go cancel your booking. I need to follow the rules of the club. Who is that guy? I will cancel it for you. None of your business. It's up to you. I'm here on business anyway. Thank you. Welcome. Come on! Let's play the guessing game! -Come on! -Okay. -How about Chicken's game? -Well, come on! -How many are there? -Come on, why don't you talk to me? Are you a man? You're the one who looks like a man. No, she looks more like a man. She has a mustache. No, this is a woman. Look. There are three breasts! One, two, three. -There are three breasts. -You are so naughty! You have three breasts! Three breasts... Mr. Bee, thank you for your treat. I'll treat you next time. Mr. Bee, Sha-man asked me to send his regards to you. When will you come to my nightclub for a drink? Sure, I will come! Thank you! See you then. Let's go. I'll be right back. Let's dance. Bee, are you having fun? Hey, Key. Cut the crap. I bring my boys here to show them the world. If you always take them to nightclubs, massage centers and brothels, they will be loyal to you forever. I am not in the mood. See you later. Boss. Po, get me two girls. I want to double the fun tonight. All of you should come with me. Okay! Boss, you are great! Is this your first time? Why are you so nervous? They said you are a virgin. So I've prepared a red packet for you. Thank you. Wow, it's hard! -Really? -Yes. Could you be a bit more professional? Just do it. Can you hear that? They are having real fun. Hey, you paid me, but you don't want to do it. Shall we do it for free? I just want to hear you moaning, okay? Why are you moaning? You haven't taken off your pants yet. I'm done. You're useless! It was very hard just now. I am sorry. -That's so you. -True. Chan Ho-nam. Are you still going to school? No. How about you? I... I will be going to England to study. That's great. Work hard since you've got a chance. Do you think they have... Why are you being so sneaky? My friends are over there. Too bad I wasn't there that day. If I had threatened them with Mr. Bee's name... You'd have suffered more. Boss, look who is talking! Sorry, Boss. Did you see those two pimps? Where will you go tomorrow? Go beat them up. Why? They look ugly. I just hate them. Are you scared? -Let's start. -Move it. Boss, do you want some? This is none of your business. -Hey, what are you doing here? -What's the matter? Don't fight! Shut up, bitch! I'll beat you if you don't shut up. Boss, should we help them? Help? This is just to test their nerves. -Stop it! -Beat him! Beat him! Beat him harder! Hit! Harder! Hit harder! Stop! -Stop! -The police are coming! -Run! -Run! To hell with you! -Run! The police are coming! -No! Run! Why did they beat you? -I don't know. -Your ID? You should be the one to check it out. 35013, calling control. I am so happy! -Go! -I'm so happy! Run! -Am I like a sexpot? -No! Let me tell you, I know the best massage girls here. Number 168, 167, 169 and 19. Why do people call this place M Center? M stands for masturbation, you know? It's so hot. You'll dry up one day, bastard! The expert said that a man can produce 20 liters of "soy milk" in his life. I've just used two liters. Do you mean coke? Two liters of coke? -Really? -Yes, it's coke. I know it too. Doggy style. -Help! -Bastards! -To hell with you! Chicken! -Stop! Doggy paddle. I won't let you go! Are you happy, boys? -Boss, we feel great! -Boss, we feel great! How dare you bully me? Boss. Isn't this great? It's great! Boss, I thought you only tattooed your arms. You look cool. There is a pair of eagles on his chest. My name is Chicken, so I think I should tattoo a chicken. How about with claws? I am named Pau-pee, should I tattoo some pee? You should tattoo it on your ass. You should tattoo it on your asshole. A tattoo is not a joke. It's fine. This represents the name of my first lover. Who is also my current wife. I tattooed it on my body, so it will be with me forever. Do you know how long it takes to tattoo all this? How long? It took me a long time. I did it whenever I was free. It took me five years altogether. Was it painful? It was very painful. Really? A tattoo will follow you forever. Once a gangster, always a gangster. When you make some money and want to join the upper class, people will know your background. Once they know you are a gangster, they'll always consider you a gangster. You guys are still green. There is still much to learn. Take your time, don't rush. I am a triad member! I am giving you a chance to achieve something. Killing Bill is not the same as going after gangsters or pimps. The workers are strong. If you fight one on one, you may not win. So I'm not sending Big Head and Po to do it. Since you are green, Bill won't recognize you. Plus, you are all underage. If you get caught, you'll only be sent to the juvenile detention center. Tomorrow, you're going to kill. Sharpen your weapons tonight. Po will drive you there. Ho-nam, it's your show. Come on. Hey, are you okay? I believe in you. I can't even kill a chicken. How can I kill a person? Bill is so muscular. It's hard to get close to him. Just stab with our knife. He will bleed, lie on the floor and cry for help. Suddenly, he will use his last breath to bite your nipple! So good. Stop it! Just for fun! Why are you so serious? Nam, you are not sharpening it right. I don't want it to be so sharp. Why not? If it is not sharp enough to kill, they will have a chance to fight back. The sharper the better. I need to go to the toilet. Just go ahead. Take your time. I'll be right back. I am working, you nut head. So? Tomorrow, you're going to kill someone. I'm afraid. Can you stay? Of course not. Don't worry. I'll be fine. Don't worry. Please don't go. I have to. What a touching scene. "You jump, I jump!" Come on! Let's do it. Damn you, Chicken! I will kill you! Why can't I sleep? Tomorrow seems to be... I don't know. I am just so afraid. You can't sleep? I wish I could. Bill has a second wife living in Mongkok. Every Saturday, he will visit that woman. Remember, he is driving an old Honda Accord. Hey, where are the weapons? -What? -I'm talking about the weapons! Chow-pee is responsible for them. How can he leave that to a woman? Those are weapons. It's better for a woman to carry them. The cops are less likely to do a body search on a woman. Will it be all right? It will be fine. Stay calm. You go home first, okay? Hey, there are cops! Stay calm. Miss, where are you going? I have my ID with me. What is inside? Can you show us? They are all books. She doesn't seem like a prostitute. Come on, leave her alone. Let's go. Where are the weapons? We were just questioned by the cops. What the hell? What can we do without weapons? -Let's do it another day. -Another day? This is the first time we're killing someone and you want me to delay it? How can we face the world? Hey, I want to take a dump now. I think I've eaten something wrong. I am going to the toilet. Nam, what should we do now? -Stick to the plan! -What? Killing him with our hands? Damn you! How dare you attack me? How dare you! Why are you fighting? Damn it! Stop! You bastard! Stay where you are! Stop! Bastard! Stop! Nam, run! Nam! Wait for me! Run! Run! Let's run! Nam! The cops are here! Sir, take the bastards away! -Run! -Run! Nam, let's go! Let's go! Hey, you're so careless! Miss, what is this place? This is Portland Street. I lost my way home. Is there any bus heading to Nam Tin? You are not a child anymore, Hong Kong is not that big. How can you lose your way home? Are you from mainland China? There is a minibus to Nam Tin, do you have any change? Yes, thank you so much! You little bitch! Why are you so nice? It's no big deal. We're here. Hold on. Stay awake. Granny, open the door! Open the door! -Chow-pee, find some bandages. -Careful! Find a towel, I need to stop the bleeding! Towel or bandage or anything! Anything! -Where are the towels? -Faster! I am searching for it! Granny, do you have a towel? -Just search for it! -I can't find it! I can't find it! I really can't find it! Chow-pee, quickly! I'm searching! Nam, you will be fine. -Who is it? -It's May. Bastard, it's your girl! Come in! What's wrong? -Why is he bleeding that bad? -Stop asking! -Find something to stop the bleeding! -Help me! -May, did you find something? -Faster! -Hurry up! -I can't find anything! -Nam will bleed to death! -Nothing's here! Shut up! Luckily, he doesn't have a fever. Give me a cigarette. Tear it up. I want the tobacco. Chow-pee, get me some bandages and scissors. Okay, scissors. Granny, scissors. Cigarettes. Granny, here is the tobacco. Mix tobacco with Yunnan Baiyao. It will stop his bleeding. It'll be all right. A real man will not be afraid of pain. If Nam didn't return to save me, he wouldn't have been injured. You silly boy. Hang on. Where is Pau-pee? Where is he? I don't know he is that stupid. He must have been killed! -What did you say? -What did you say? So what? Shut up! You should've taken care of your brother! You should have taken care of your friend! What kind of brother are you? I don't know anything! -I'm going to buy some painkillers. -What the hell? -Granny, I've got something useful. -Are you kidding? That's your brother! -I don't know, stop bothering me! -Go and search for him! -What are you waiting for? -Nam, do you feel better now? -Chow-pee! -Pau-pee, where have you been? Chow-pee! Where the hell have you been? I am worried about you! Where have you been? I lost my way home. You silly boy! Let's drink a cup of tea first. Drink it, it'll calm you down. Nam, it will stop your pain. It's better than painkillers. Help! Chan Ho-nam. I want to kill you! I want to kill you! -Die! -To hell with you! -Mr. Bee. -Kwan. Let's talk out there. What the hell is this? We're in front of the God of Kwan now, everyone should be righteous and honest. This shows my sincerity, right? Kwan, are you sick? You're talking about sincerity? Bee, I am very sincere in front of you. Are you teasing me? I'm just talking bullshit. Well, there are two things. Nam was hurt by Piggy. It's none of my business. What do you mean? Piggy is one of your men. That bastard betrayed me and followed Sha-man. It drives me mad! You can ask Blackie. He asked me to go with him, but I am loyal. Okay, that's enough. Well, I envy you, Bee. All your men are loyal to you. I should learn from you. What you're saying is that Piggy's attack wasn't under your control. Bee, I've really got nothing to do with that. How about the other thing? It's good news. I'm doing some decoration business in Yuen Long. We'll collect land and build over 200 villas. -I want you to be my partner. -That's so nice of you. Well, it takes quite a long time to collect enough land. Your future looks bright. After Bill's death, the whole Tung Fung Garden will be yours. You'll be damn rich! Will you let me join you? Sure, no problem. We belong to the same triad. Of course, I will cooperate with you. Well, among all the branch leaders of Hung Hing, you are the most righteous guy. Let's make money together. But something needs to be done first. Will you give me a hand? Sure. We are a family, right? Bee, may I ask something? How is Nam now? Tung Sing Boys and the cops are all looking for him. Thank you for your concern. It's killing me! Boss. Boss, I am in great pain! Let me smoke! I will quit it, I swear! Boss! It's killing me. I feel cold. Ho-nam is feeling cold. Please give it to him. How dare you take heroin? Just once, okay? I will quit it! -Don't beat me, Boss! -No! Ho-nam is feeling cold. Give it to him, please! Feeling cold? It'll kill you, do you know that? -You will die! -Ho-nam is freezing! Boss, just once! Okay? Boss, no! -I won't do it again! -How dare you take heroin? Boss! Let me go! Let me go! No! Stop, Boss! Enough! I am sorry, I am freezing! Let me go! -No! -Stop, Boss! -Bastards! -We won't do that again. Please. Let us go. Leave these two bastards alone. Let's go! -Don't leave us here! -Let us go! -Boss, no! -Let us go! -Boss, don't leave us alone! -Boss, no! Boss, have some tea. Give these painkillers to them. Hurry up! Don't beat us! No! It's not his fault! Come out. I won't beat you. -Take two. -Look at Chicken. Nam, take it. Are you all right? So? Are you okay? I feel better now. Aren't you angry with me for beating you so badly? My dad died early. I haven't been beaten that badly before. Heroin will ruin your life. It hurts me to beat you, you know? I know you did it for my own good. I will discuss with Camel about the Tung Sing case. You'd better hide in Macau for a while. IN LOVING MEMORY OF CHAN JI-LOK Give me a wonton, okay? I want it too. -What do you want? -Let me feed you some brisket. It's so hot! Do you want some chicken knuckles? GOVERNADOR NOBRE DE CARVALHO BRIDGE Come on! Let's have a race across the bridge. Race across the bridge? Are you insane? The bridge is so long. I'll die before I get to the other side. Hey, will you join us? A MONTH LATER, TONG LUO WAN There are 40 million people. -There are 40 million people! -There are 40 million people! -No dictatorship! No authoritarianism! -No dictatorship! No authoritarianism! -No dictatorship! No authoritarianism! -No dictatorship! No authoritarianism! -No dictatorship! No authoritarianism! -No dictatorship! No authoritarianism! PO LEUNG KOK Come and dance with me. I grew up in the orphanage. I always come back when I have time. Why did you follow me? I saw you crying at the telephone booth. I was worried, so I followed you. So, you have followed me for quite some time. What a shame! You always see me when I'm crying. My friends said you are cool and you never cry. Even Big Head hasn't seen me cry. How about last time? Last time? The nurse who took care of me in the orphanage died. How about just now? Can you play with me? To make me happy? How? Do you want me to do this? Of course not! Let's go and have fun! Hit this! Hit it! What the hell are you doing? -Your machine is out of order! -No. -It's not. -There are no tickets. -Please check the machine! -Okay, let me check. You are good with that machine. I go there to make myself happy whenever I feel sad. Do you know there's some magic? For the greedy people, they will move those coins in the middle. But they are not movable because it's too heavy. But if you push the coins to the side, it's not that heavy. So, they will be easily moved. Do you always come here with Big Head? No. He said these are childish games. He hates this place. You scared me with your hairstyle when I last saw you at the nightclub. It's not your style. Do you know me? Not really. I don't even know myself. When is your birthday? April 4. Children's Day. Your zodiac is Aries. You'll have a chance to be a boss. Do you believe in that? When is your birthday? February 14. Valentine's Day. I'm Aquarius. Are all Aquarius girls like you? Yes. I love to fantasize and I'm always deep in thoughts. My name is Fei. F, E, I. Actually, I want to name myself Fly. I feel like a bird. I can fly as high as I want, as far as I wish. If one day I fly away, I may not come back. You know, I am used to ditching my boyfriends. That's why I'm thinking of ditching Big Head. Are you flirting with me? Stop dreaming! Who do you think you are? You're too young! Time to eat, little boy! -Time to eat, boy! -Eat already! Your hair. Don't touch my hair. I don't know you that well. What's wrong with your face? I was beaten by Big Head. I fought with him on the phone. No matter what, a man should never beat a woman. Does it hurt? Yes. Do you dare to kiss me? Do you dare to kiss me right here? Are you challenging me? You said I am too young. Why did you kiss me? You said I am too young. I just kissed you. It doesn't mean anything. Why are you blushing? Am I blushing? I want to see Fei. Do you know where she is? I can't find her either. Who did you just call? I called her, but no one answered. Did you come out from her home this morning? Yes, so what? Do you want to take my girl? If you consider her your girlfriend, you wouldn't have beaten her. Did you sleep with her? None of your business. Bastard! Do you practice boxing in order to punch your girl? All right, let's fight. If I win, return Fei to me. Fei is a girl, not a gift. She can choose her own lover. You don't even know how to flatter a girl. How can you be her boyfriend? Have you seen Fei smile? Have you made her feel happy? Answer me! Time's up! You guys are so hardworking. You two are so serious. Wow, your nose is bleeding. I don't care what's going on between the two of you. But it ends now. Ho-nam, you've gotten enough rest. Tomorrow, you and Big Head will lead a team each to negotiate with Tung Sing Boys at a construction site in Junk Bay. Kwan will be there too. Me leading a team? Yes, Big Head and you will be the leaders. Call all the guys back to sleep here tonight. Don't work alone. Big Head, is there any problem? No problem. I'M LEAVING THE HOUSE AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN I WILL COME BACK, BYE You are right. I haven't seen Fei smile before. And I haven't cared about her feelings. I am glad you understand at last. They used two buses to block both the northern and southern roads. They even went to the streets to block other roads. Under the pressure by the students and the public, the troops retreated... -So many calls this early? -And now they are... -My mom is in the hospital. -Many were injured... -Is she okay? -Some of them were bleeding badly. Most of the troops have retreated... HUP YIK MACHINERIES -Boss! -Boss! -Boss! -Boss! Kwan and his men will wear white gloves. You should wear white gloves too. Don't kill your friends by mistake. Get your weapons! Boss, Kwan and his men are not showing up. We have an appointment at the opposite side. Hung Hing Boys are famous for fighting. We'll be fine even if we're outnumbered. Bee is in trouble this time. I told him I'd offer him 60 people and he has to gather another 40. When my guys don't show up, he'll be in deep shit. Piggy will lead a hundred people there. They will definitely win. Sha-man, you are so nice to give Piggy a chance to do something. He was your follower. -Of course, I will take care of him. -Bullshit. He may be killed or become your scapegoat. Let's see whether he is lucky this time. Hey, you said that... you are great at doing something like this. So what's going on? Are you sleepy? I want to change! All right, exchange! How about this girl? Kwan. Since you are my friend, we can share the same girl, right? This one is nice! She did a good job for me. Hey, wait a second. You just served my friend, so I'd like you to clean your mouth first. I don't know if your mouth is actually dirty. Wow! -Great! -Hey! Kwan and his men are coming. I know that Kwan won't ditch me. Come on, kill them! -Kill them! -Kill them! Damn it! They are from Tung Sing! -Boss, you better leave first! -Kwan tricked us! Let's run! Get him! -Don't let them go! -Stop! -Stop there! -Stop! -Stop! -Let me kill him! Take this! Nam, where else can you go? We must cooperate now. Damn it! Bastard! Run, Big Head, run! Stay where you are! Bastard! Cops are coming, run! -Run! -Run! Help. Help. Help! SOME FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM AND DREAMS. SOME FOUGHT FOR NOTHING. Help me! Help! Anybody? Help me. Help! Gang fight. Serve them right! Cut the crap, save them first! Since 10 p.m. last night, the Chinese soldiers started to shoot at the people and students who stopped them from moving into town. Until now, over 2,600 people were shot dead. This is the first time the Communist Government... Miss, where is Chan Suk-fong? Slow down. Why was she sent to the hospital? I don't know, which room is she in? On this programme, we will discuss... Hey, which room? Look, I'm checking. You are as fierce as the communists. Around ten last night, the troops that are sent out have started to move into town for a bloody suppression. Nurse, is that Chan Suk-fong? There is a name tag. Read it yourself. Mom! Please don't die! Mom! Let me see my mom! Please! Sorry, we're going to the mortuary now. I don't care! I want to see my mom! -Mom, don't go! -Calm down! Mom, don't go! Mom! Don't leave me! Just like you, I couldn't see her one last time before she died. When she died this morning, you were killing others. Mom! I got an order... to clean up the mess you people made, so l... I couldn't come to the hospital. I was so afraid that you were one of the injured ones. Mom! That I would need to carry you to my ambulance. Last night, many people died. Did you see that? There are so many people watching people die on the news. I don't care how they died at Tiananmen. I just want to know how my mom died. Tell me! I am tired. I have to go back -and take care of Mui and Dee. -Mom. Call me tomorrow, I want to discuss her funeral with you. Don't leave! Tell me how my mom died! Don't move! Do you want more punches? I'll tear your head apart! Boss, this is the money we got today. Check it, please. Shut up! Shut up! Don't move! How are the girls? They pray right after coming back. They are like nuns. -Get more girls for me. -Yes, Boss. -Keep it. -Okay. What are you looking at? Stop staring! What do you want? What do you want? Pick him up. Still trying to be cool? Do you know who I am? I am Sha-man of Tung Sing. Do you know who he is? He is my real brother. What? You were lucky to escape this morning. But now, you are with me. God won't help you this time. -Let's fight one-on-one! -He's counter-attacking! How dare you! How dare you counter-attack my ass! Damn it! Open his mouth! Bastard! Hang him up! You dare to kill my brother. You should be prepared for people to take revenge on. Fine. But I won't let you die easily. I will have fun with you tonight! Come here! Do you know what this is? I learned it from Long Arm of the Law. I'll cover your head and let the mice bite you! You're so dead now! Here we go! Yes. Boss. -What the hell? -Your boss is on the line. Hello? Chan Ho-nam? All right, you're the boss. Do your best! Break his head! You bastards! Let me do it! Beat him! Hold his leg! Do you want to play with me? I'll treat you to some rats! To hell with you! Did you watch the television? So many people died at Tiananmen. You didn't watch the news, did you? Did you hear what Yuan Mu said? No one died. Last night, the situation was like... That guy must be a gangster like us! Hey, you look like Yuan Mu. You are flattering me! I'm more handsome, right? -Hey, Bee! -Bee, do you want to join us? -Sit down! -Hey, sit down! You're winning and now you're leaving? -I didn't win much! -But I lost a lot. -Go on. -You guys are the worst. You know I seldom beg for other's help. Bee, we are friends. Just say it. I have been looking for Mr. Chiang and Chan Yiu, but they are not in Hong Kong. That's why I would like you to give me some advice. I was informed that you and Kwan were supposed to fight with Tung Sing. Don't mention that bastard. People said he's a scum, but I didn't believe it. But now, he has proven it right. It doesn't matter. He tricked you once, so you can make him pay for it. But my boy was caught by the Tung Sing men. Camel wants negotiation. I hope you can help me. Bee. He is only a follower. You can find another one. If he's dead, just find someone else. Is your boy good at fighting? If he was, he wouldn't have been caught. All my boys are important to me. Well, it's quite difficult for us. You did that for your personal interest, now you seek help from us. We are not supposed to be involved, right? Seven, you're the banker. I've lost a lot, the game should go on. Bee, let's wait until we finish the game. Then, we'll discuss the matter with you, okay? All right, excuse me. Let's go! Once you're under me, I'll treat you like my sons. Ho-nam is now in trouble, are you coming with me? You decide for yourselves. STEAMED BUNS AND FRUITS If you are afraid and want to stay, I won't blame you. Boss, we are Nam's friends. I'm coming with you. Stand right there! Bee. Your boss, Camel is waiting for me. Many people are waiting for you. The Brave Six! My boss said, you can only bring two people with you. What? Why? -Is Tung Sing afraid of me and my boys? -No one gives a damn! But you're on our turf now. So, you're outnumbered. We'll let you bring two people with you since we want others to know what will happen. Fine. Well, the three of you stay behind. Chicken and Po, follow me. Wait. Bee, I am sorry. Just a routine check. Boss, nothing was found. Good. Bee, you are really tough! Boss, you called and wanted all of us to attend this meeting. What's wrong? Sha-man's real brother died. He kidnapped one of Bee's men for a negotiation. Sha-man is the smartest one out of us. We should make him happy somehow. Boss, he is a troublemaker. Don't you worry that he is using us? If there's something in it for us, we'll help. -That's right. -True. Boss. So many VlPs are waiting. I am so proud. Bee. We are not fighting against the Japanese. We are friends, aren't we? -Hey, serve them tea now! -Okay. Where are your manners? Well, the leaders of our group are all here. You want to save that kid. And you promised to give us anything we want. Well, the boss is listening. Go ahead. What's the name of the kid? Chan Ho-nam. Where is he? Bring him out. Bastard! Are you guys animals? Nam! Chicken, behave yourself! Stop acting stupid! Boss... Jeez, do you have to treat my boy like that? He should thank me for not killing him. He owes me my brother's life. Sha-man, what do you want? Just tell him frankly. All right. About the decoration business of Tung Fung Garden, Hung Hing Boys should leave everything to us. And after the gang fight, 1 of our boys died, 20 were injured, and 30 were caught. You should pay me three million dollars for compensation. Also, Nam should be out of my sight. He can never come back! Do you have to be so tough? Li Peng should have asked you to negotiate with the students. You can't put it that way. Your boy killed his brother. He should pay for it. You called me here to keep him alive. But Sha-man said you promised to compensate. So, I called my men to meet you here. What do you think? Sha-man's loss is our loss too. He should pay us one-third of what he will get. Sha-man, you have gained much from the decoration business. My people can't even make a living in Tuen Mun. Why don't you leave some jobs for us? Bee, what do you think? I just want to know if I don't agree with that, will you let me walk out of here? Let's go to hell together. You have the guts to come here. If I harm you, that'll only mean that I'm spiteful, right? I don't have to worry then. Po, have you finished what I told you? Yes, Boss. Sha-man, Bill and I shared the decoration business. But he didn't stick to the rules. He asked for it, so you can blame no one. Regarding the gang fight yesterday, it's a gangster's game. You know that too. You want compensation? Who will compensate for my loss then? You're really smart though. You allied with Kwan to trap me. You prefer cooperating with the betrayer of Hung Hing, but not your own people. You are great! What's that bullshit? Bee, do you mean you are not sorry and wouldn't pay a penny? If I was wrong, I would admit it. I don't even mind giving half the decoration business to you. As his boss, I am obliged to protect him. Boss! Boss! Boss... Camel, this is for Tung Sing! Camel, I hope you will let my boy go. -Boss, you can't do that! -Shut up! Be generous this time. You'll gain something in the future. It's a lesson you should learn! Boss is right. Sha-man, this is your fault. -Take Ho-nam and go. -Okay. -Let's go, Nam. Get up. -Boss... Camel, I asked my boy to kidnap your granddaughter. How dare you! Don't worry. If I get out of here alive, your granddaughter will be very safe. Thank you, Boss. Let's go. Get up, let's go! Come on! It'll be all right. Let's go home, Nam. Come on. Life is like gambling! If you don't gamble, how do you know you'll win? Kwan, what will you bet? Banker, double! Banker! Kwan, the banker has won four times in a row. Are you sure? What? I love to be a banker, so I bet on the banker. Do you agree, dear? I want to bet on a player this time. It's around 30 points. -Move. -Yes. Kwan, see. Player wins. What? Can you see it? I've got nine! -Banker wins! -What? Again? -What's wrong with it? -Banker wins! Hey, Red Bull! -What's the matter, Kwan? -What the hell is wrong with Sha-man? What time is it now? Why do I have to wait? Is he sleeping with a girl up there? He has to check the books, he will be here soon. Damn it! Ask him to get his ass down here now! Faster! Dear, you bring me good luck! Come on, this is for you. -You are so naughty! -Come on! -Hey, this is for you. -Thank you, Kwan. Cop's raid! Hands up! -Don't move! -Stop there! -Squat! -Stop! -Don't move! -Squat! -Don't move! -Stop! Red Bull, didn't you say that this turf is safe? -Why are the police here? -I don't know anything! Show me your identity card. Kwan, you are in trouble. My boss had a good talk with Camel. He told us to do something here. What the hell is this? It's just an illegal gambling turf, no big deal. -You're very cocky. -What is it? Sir. What's the relationship between you and this girl? Sir, she is my mom! She feeds me milk. She is my girl, so what? She is underage. We can charge you with having illegal sex with an underage girl. Madam, are you blind? Look at her measurements, 36, 24, 36. She is so mature! By the way, you don't seem to be that mature, madam! Mr. Kwan, I'll turn 16 next month. -Let's go, Kwan! Hey! -Your girl too. One after another. I don't know her very well, -she just sticks around... -Move! Don't worry, it won't hurt much. KWAN WAS PUT INTO PRISON FOR THREE YEARS FOR HAVING SEX WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL TWO MONTHS LATER, CHAN HO-NAM RECOVERED The tattoo will follow you forever, are you sure about this? Do it. It'll be quick, it won't hurt much. A TATTOO WILL FOLLOW YOU FOREVER. NO MORE GOING BACK AFTER THAT!
