There was no tarmac on these roads before. Before it was just sand and gravel. So my feet got very tough walking barefeet on these roads in the old days. So the monks nowadays they don't know what tough is about. They've got it easy, not like me. I mean, you have so many beauty contests in Thailand. They're really popular things. Like you have Miss Lamyai. You know, lamyai the fruit. When it's lamyai season they have Miss Lamyai competition. And when it's mango season it's Miss Mango. And... 00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,700 I guess Miss Garlic and whatever. And of course the usual regional things, Miss Pasang, Miss Lamphun and whatever. So, yea, beauty contests are really, extremely popular in Thailand. What kind of rewards do they get? I don't know, I mean, I don't follow this scene very much. They are playing the... It's the national anthem. When I first came to Bangkok, I would hear this music being played every morning. And I thought it was like the advert for Ovaltine. Because it sounded just like the... the way it used to be advertised in England. Like in, say Thammasat University or in the streets people would just stop in their tracks when they played it over the loudspeakers. And everyday, it's twice a day. There were these kids called the Ovaltineys. Used to sing this song: We are the Ovaltineys. This is just what the Thai national anthem sounds like. I didn't... I was just struck how much they're advertising Ovaltine and... until one morning I was walking through the streets and everybody stopped. What's happenin? When I was a boy my mother once lied to me. And I asked her what love meant. She said you'll know when it happens. Well, in the 20 years since I've left home, I've experienced all kinds of states of lust, hate, delusion and whatnot. But I've never had an experience that came with a very clear warning label saying "LOVE", this is love. Never happened to me, so... I was Buddhist monk for a total of 16 years and then I decided to disrobe and got married. Does your mother ever ask you about Buddhism? No. She has no interest in it. What did she say when you told her that you're going to become a Buddhist monk? "Oh?" Yes, some people would say that this is just running away from life. But in fact it's not, it's a confrontation and... a direct exploration of life. By facing up to it. Where is in fact what most people are ordinarily doing, is just distracting themselves in one way or another. With sensuality and with... seeking entertainment and sex and drinking and so on but we are not doing that. We are living very simply and just... directly looking at experience as it comes. Without seeking to control conditions. And so I don't think this is escapism it's quite the opposite really. I first came to Iceland in April 1994. For a 3 week visit to the home of a pen friend. And then during that visit I met a lot of the Thai residents. The rumor went around among the Thai residents, that there was a Buddhist monk visiting. So then many of them came over to see me and some of them invited me to live on in Iceland. Stay on here and maybe establish a temple. So I said, well maybe. I like the country very much. Especially the quietness and the clean air but I'm not completely free yet. I've only been a full monk 10-9 years you see. So that meant I had to get permission from the authorities in Thailand. So I said if they let me, then I'll come and live here. I had to go back to Thailand first and then I asked for permission to come and live in Iceland. To do missionary work here, teaching Buddhism. And working with the Thai community here. They said yea, we'll be glad to get rid of you. That's how I came here. In late '94 I had an invitation from a pen friend to come visit him here in Iceland and so I did. There is a thousand and one different reasons. I mean some people take up Buddhist practice because you know, they've had some deep experience of suffering that has caused them to rethink their life. Some people get interested when they're in prison. Some people get interested after seeing a Bruce Lee film. When you walk the streets of Reykjavík do you think people are looking at you, do you feel like you're different? Nowadays they're not looking at me very much because they've got used to me. And I think most people now know who I am. And they also know that I'm not a Hare Krishna. So they don't have to avoid me 00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,600 because I'm going to try and sell them a book or something. So you can walk the streets quietly. So, yea I walk the streets quietly. I mean a few... 00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,700 you know, teenagers will shout out jeers and laugh and so on but I guess if I was their age I would too, so... That's nothing unusual. But certainly I don't get anything here, like the aggression that I get on the streets of England. Really? So it's... I feel very safe here. You didn't find it at all difficult to decide to become celibate for your life? No, it's not difficult to become it, it's difficult to remain it. You know, to be able to endure the sexual frustration which sometimes arises. It's certainly not easy. And in fact, the vast majority of monks who leave the monkhood, do so because they want to get married. I mean, that the reason it's not recommended is because generally your rebirth after you are dead will depend upon your state of mind at the time of death. You know? And your state of mind will generally be conditioned by what you've done in your life, how you lived. That will condition your state of mind and that will determine the sort of rebirth you get in the next life. Now the problem with committing suicide is that people generally do it when they're feeling suicidal. Here in Iceland, usually I get up at about 5 o'clock or... there are some monasteries in Thailand where it might be 3, 4 o'clock in the morning. And the day usually starts by taking a bath. And then there'll be some kind of morning service beginning with chanting and followed by meditation. After breakfast one would then... generally attend to any chores that need to be done in the monastery. Cleaning, sweeping... Whatever... Try to focus on you... All right, right. Haven't I done this already? Well, anyway carry on. Right, so at about 8 o'clock we have breakfast. I have breakfast. At 8 o'clock I have breakfast. My first year was pretty tough. I mean, I was living mostly on about 10 or 12 thousand a month. Which is not very easy. I had a room for about 8 thousand a month, I think. And I was being fed by the local Thai restaurant some days a week. But we were very poor So I just lived a very very simple life in a single room and... the more or less didn't starve. Like you are more or less kept above starvation level. Because of course the... the Thais very quickly lost interest in me. You know, I was like a 5 minute wonder. And then I was trapped here, I had no money to get out of the country. And if it wasn't for just a couple of restaurants in Reykjavík 00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500 I would have starved. But on the other hand the good thing of first year was the university. I entered the course: Icelandic for foreigners. Which was good, I made a lot of friends doing that. But apart from that the first year was pretty hard. But then we started Búddistafélag. And after that it became very easy because we've got tons of money from all the Buddhists in Iceland. Everybody who registers as a Buddhist, 00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,800 you know, the tax they would pay to the church would come to Búddistafélag. So after that we were financially okay. Well, I was financially okay. Do you want it to make a full sentence? Exactly. Okay. There are about 350 Buddhists in Iceland. The third year was the disasterous year. That was the year of the temple-project. The sister of the king of Thailand decided, she wanted to build a temple, a Buddhist temple in Iceland. But there was a lot fighting among the Thai... 00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,200 residents here about where the temple should be. And this became very unpleasant. And in the end the Thai economy collapsed and we... the whole project was postponed anyway. So it didn't really matter where the temple was gonna be. It was a difficult year for me and... you know, people were spreading a lot of untrue stories and writing letters to the authorities in Thailand complaining about me. But in a way it was good, I learned who my friends were during this period. Among the Thais here. And then the fouth year, this year is just being sabai sabai. As the Thais say. "Sabai", it just means it's been okay, cool, calm, no problems. The Icelandic way is they give you a cup of half cold water and then 2 minutes later the waitress comes and brings you a teabag and puts it in. In England you put it in boiling hot. Then you leave it at least 2 or 3 minutes. I see. Icelanders don't know anything about tea. Changillo! In Thailand neary every Buddhist temple has cats. Because the custom is that if you have a cat or a dog that has puppies and you don't want the puppies or the kittens then you give them to the Buddhist temple. You don't drown them like you might do in some other countries. So temples are always full of cats. And in the temples where I lived in Thailand, I always took care of them. There is always some monk who does it. And so I got used to being surrounded by cats. And after I've been in Iceland a year I decided I wanted one. And he's called Changillo, which is a Sanskrit word, it means "the one who can't sit still". Well he's sitting still now but he didn't when he was a kitten. A mouse came in one day and the cat was chasing the mouse around but he wasn't catching it he was just chasing it and as soon as the mouse stopped the cat would stop too. And he wouldn't catch it. Really strange. And I tried to catch the mouse myself and let it go but I couldn't and then I had to go out. And I came back several hours later and the cat was still just playing with the mouse, he hadn't killed it or See, it's a Buddhist cat. So, Robert are you happy? I'm okay, yeah. You mean generally in life, are you happy? In life. Oh, sorry, in general? I thought you meant the microphone and everything. Is it still there? Yeah, still there. Sometimes. Sometimes? Yes. I mean that's all one could expect, I think. I think it's unreasonable to expect anything else. Your happiness or unhappiness 00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,000 is just conditioned by so many things that are beyond your control. So, you know, you can't say to yourself that I will be happy and you can't be certain that this desire and this plan to be happy will be fulfilled. But you can always be detached. You can always be calm. Because you are not holding to states of mind and you are not clinging to being happy or being unhappy. You're just watching these states come and go. So actually I very rarely ask myself whether I'm happy or not. I only speak about it if somebody else asks me. I was born in Leeds in Yorkshire, the north of England. But I grew up mostly in Nottinghamshire in a country village, really a dormitory village for commuters going to work in Notthingham city. A middle class residential area with middle class English parents and... and a younger sister five years younger than me. I was brought up in the Church of England and it's just happend that our local village church in Notthingham was a middle churchy kind of church. Middle churchy basically means a church where no one gives a fuck... My parents had... very unlike each other. My father came from a working class mining family in Yorkshire. His parents had both died when he was quite young so he'd been brought up by various aunts and grandmas 00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,300 and other members of the extended family. And he had quite a rough-ready Yorkshire way about him. My mother came from a completely different end of the social scale from about seven generations of Yorkshire society artists. So most of her ancestors were members of the Royal Art Academy. And it was a very high-churchy, Anglo-Catholic, sort of rather snooty kind of Yorkshire aristocracy. So from the point of view of her family she'd really married beneath herself. And she then spent the rest of her life trying to pull my father up to her level. Sending him for elocution lessons and train not to drop his H's, sort of thing. And my father started his work in life in the Royal Air Force where he was an electrical engineer and then my mother, she was a hairdresser. Right from leaving school until, even to now. I think now she's still doing hairdressing. Yes, my mother and I are quite close. Usually I go visit her every couple of years or so. And we write regularly, at least once a month. Well, I was something of a loner, so I enjoyed walking in the woods by myself and fighting imaginary enemies and killing insects and all the usual innocuous things that boys do. I also read a lot. I was a bookworm from about the age of 6 or so. I wasn't much into sports. The complete basket case at football, cricket and everything else. But I enjoyed chess. Yes at the school a subject I most enjoyed was creative writing. I mean I was always somewhat overimaginative so it was good to express this somehow. It was a way of not going crazy but putting your craziness on paper. I left home when I think when I was 16 and then I worked as an engraver. For the 2 years. During that time inbetween since when I left home until the time I became a monk. I was an engraver. Well, an apprentice engraver. And then as a monk of course I didn't need to... you know, you're a mendicant you just see what people offer to you, so you don't much need to earn a living. I'd became interested in Buddhism about the age of 14 and when I was 18 I decided to become a monk. It just seemed to be the next thing to do. It was just the next step on a sort cumulative path of progression that had just happened. As a result of first reading a book about Buddhism when I was 14. Then later on meeting various monks and other Buddhist teachers who had impressed me very much. Initially I thought that I would just enter a monastery for a period of 3 months. Which is very common in the 00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,500 Southeast Asian Buddhist countries, like Thailand and Burma. You just spend part of your life in a monastery undergoing training to provide you with some basic ethical and spiritual education. That 3 months has now lasted somewhat longer. It lasted 15 years. It simply never occured to me to stop being a monk. It is very hard to say to get you to understand maybe but you know, when I first went in it definitely would just gonna be 3 months then I went to live with a monk down on the Isle of Wight in the south of England. But out of every so many monks who do this, telling it to be temporary there will be a certain number who find that they come to adapt a much more serious attitude. Well I can't really point to any particular incident or event during this period that made this decision. But it just seemed to be the next thing to do after this 3 months. So I ended up staying on with this teacher for about 2 years altogether as a... we call it novice monk, samanera. Then, when I was 20 years old, my teacher recommended me to go and train further in Thailand. There is a lady who paid half of... 00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,400 one of the laywomen who visited our monastery sometimes when she heard I wanted to go, she offered to pay half the fare. And the other half came from some old bank account I had, which I'd forgotten about. I had... my godfather had died many years before and left some money in the will that had been put into some trust and everbody forgot about it. And when I was just searching for my birth certificate I've found this... these papers and discovered I had all this money so... So that's how I got to Thailand. Yea, the first arriving at the airport was remarkable, it was marvellous. I had not made any previous arrangements in Thailand. I just arrived at the airport and my thought was that I would just walk out of the airport and look for a monk. There are monks everywhere in Bangkok. So I'll just find a monk and say can I stay in your temple? But what happened, I joined the end of the queue at the airport and then I was immediately summoned by this guard he came out to me and saluted like this and he said please come this way and he took me straight through the VIP gate. Because, you know, monks... every monk is a VIP in Thailand. And then I found myself surrounded by all these people wanting to help me. And... you know, like tourist guides and just people working at the airport and wanting to take me anywhere I wanted to go offering me money one guy wanted to buy me a pair of glasses. This is my first experience in Thailand. So, very positive. And then one lady told me that she knew of a temple where 00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,500 there was another English monk. So, she took me there, in her car and... I was dropped off. And it was fortunate that I had a letter of introduction 00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100 from the abbott of the Thai temple in London. And it turned out she'd brought me to his temple and I was given his room to stay in. He was a section head of this temple so it was actually quite a plush room for a monk especially for a novice, I was only a novice at the time. But because I had a letter of intruducion from him, I was given his room. And then I was just completely spoiled to death for the first week or so. Because, you know, the Thais really like Western monks. They have a lot of illusions about the west they tend to look on it as a great Western paradise. And so they think it's really wonderful that you've choosen to give up all that and come to their country and practice their religion. A bit of an inferiority complex, I guess. But they do appreciate Western monks very much. So I was looked after very kindly. But it was in Bangkok and it's a pretty tough place to live if you've just arrived in the country and you're not used to the heat and the weather and the different food and everything. And Bangkok is ultra hot and ultra noisy and dirty and polluted. So I had to get out of it pretty quickly I've found. So I went up to the north, north-east of the country to the countryside where the air is much cleaner. And entered then a forest monastery. I thought that I'll probably be there for some years it is usual... the custom in Thailand is that when you take higher ordination you're supposed to live with your teacher for at least 5 years. So I knew I'll be there at least that long But I wasn't... I had no definite plans for what would happen after that. My first forest monastery was in Udon Thani, in northeastern Thailand. During the Vietnam War it was a place where the Americans had one of their largest air bases and they would take off everyday with these B-52 bombers and go off to Vietnam dropping bombs on jungles. Hoping that someone was standing under one of the trees. And apart from that Udon Thani is also famous for 00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,000 sugar, rice and forest monasteries. So that's where I started, then later I moved to the more temperate regions of Chiang Mai in Lampoon which is the far north of the country. The first year was very difficult but after that it was very easy. Sorry. Yea, the first year in Thailand was rather difficult for me. There was of course tremendous culture shock. Thailand is a very very different kind of place to England. Even though I've been a monk in England for 2 years, it was quite different really living in Thailand in a country that has a very evolved pattern of social etiquette. Where you can do something that you think is really quite innocent and that can actually cause great offense because it violates some taboo that you didn't know about. So learning the culture and learning the language really took my quite a while at least 2 years 00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,800 before I could really be at home in that place. But after that, things went very smooth. I mean, in all the monasteries I lived I was very popular. Which was a kind of new experience for me I've never experienced popularity in my life before. I'd always been the unpopular person in the class or at least the loner, someone who stood apart. Then in Thai monasteries I've found that people really liked me and I was treated very kindly. This in itself brought about quite a big change, I began to think more in social terms, more about the community and environment around me rather than just being preoccupied with my own concerns. I had a cave and I was living there, a village of some Karen hill tribe people. But I had to leave there because the government made a dam which cut off my water supply. It effects different monks in different ways. A lot of monks for example are always dreaming about their old girlfriends. I wasn't. I was dreaming about my old bookcases. Well, I dreamt about girlfriends sometimes but mostly I was missing my books. So, yeah, I mean, after a while you settle into a certain pattern so it doesn't seem you life involves much in the way of privation. It may seem the discipline is very severe at first but after a while you settle into this pattern of living so it doesn't seem severe anymore. I lived for the first 6 years mostly in forest monasteries where I was lucky to have a very fine teacher and the monstery where I lived for most of the time was... one that had only been very recently started. By a young Thai monk, young Thai teacher-monk who was a very gifted meditation teacher but... one whom very few people knew about. So that meant, you didn't have the problem that you did with the great gurus who have massive followings. When I first went to live with him there were only 4 of us in the monastery. I think now there's about 30 or so but when I went there, there was just 4 of us. No electricity, no water, nothing it was a very very simple life but he was a wonderful guy to be with. So that was a most pleasant time. The poem I'd like to read now is called "Light Breaks When No Sun Shines" No, it isn't! Wrong page! Cut that bit out! I'm talking bullshit really. To a large extent I find myself acting as an intermediary and as a translator between Thais and Icelanders. And especially between Thais and Icelandic authorities things like government departments. Which would be quite a... very bizzare thing for a monk to be involved in, in any Asian country. You don't normally have much to do with the secular authorities. We as monks are entirely dependent upon the support of lay people. We don't - for example - get paid any kind of salary for being monks. So you are dependent for everything, every mouthful of food you eat is given to you by lay people. There is traditionally an understanding that monks will reciprocate they will earn what they're getting in support in two ways. Firstly by practicing the Buddhist teaching for the purpose of purifying the heart and mind. But also it's traditional that a monk should teach. You should give guidance in Buddhadharma and he should get involved in things like reconciling any disputes that arise in communinties. Like for marriage problems here, cultural misunderstandings between couples. So, from time to time I get a telephone call. When the phone is plugged in. For example with the Thai-Icelandic marriages. Most of them have been pretty good I think but... sometimes things go wrong and very often this is due to a mutual lack of cultural understanding. Thai etiquette has a whole load of principles that you just don't find in any Western culture. Things like value being assigned to each part of the body. So like the head has a very high value and the... say anywhere from the knee downwards especially the feet, are considered rather low and dirty. So you must never allow your foot to higher than somebody else's head or point with the soles of your feet at somebody. This kind of stuff. So an Icelandic husband might accidentally be... continually offending his wife and... without knowing it and she's being polite and not saying anything but getting very angry and then one day she goes crazy and... starts throwing plates against the wall or something. So I get called out sometimes to deal with problems like this. The central teaching of Buddhism is that everything is impermanent. Everything is impermanent. There is nothing, that is worth having nothing worth clinging to there is nothing worth being. One of the things that is impermanent is the attitude that people have towards love. In particular the sexual-romantic relationship. We only have to look back over a few centuries to see that this attitude is itself subject to impermanence. In the Middle Ages and even today in many Asian countries love is of very little significance in relationships. When a woman is looking for her partner or or her parents looking for a partner for her the main consideration is practical things. Is he going to be nice to her? Is he not gonna beat her up? Is he gonna have enough money to support her? Does he refrain from drinking and other dissolute habits? And if he fulfills all those criteria then he'll be a good husband for her and if they don't love each other, well that's just too bad, they can always learn to do so. I'm not saying this attitude is a good one but it's a very prevalent one in many countries and has served as a basis of social stability for a long long time. Now in Iceland, things are somewhat different. Sorry, I'm just laughing. Cut! Well, is that not enough? What do I know about love? I've been a monk since I was 18. I had been... considering disrobing during the last 2 or 3 years that I was in the monkhood and this movement in that direction became... stronger and stronger until it became... it reached a kind of crisis point. The crisis consisted in a... a conviction that I'd really made a big mistake in entering the moonkhood at such an early age. And... that I better do something about it before I get too old to be able to adapt to any other sort of life. The time I disrobed and left the order I was just doing it very impulsively I was taking no advice from anybody and I didn't want to be talked out of it. So I talked to nobody. Why not? You go to Mallorca or Ibiza, you go to Kazakhstan. So in December 1999 I decided to go in a trip to Karaganda, in Kazakhstan. I wanted to go to this country for a long time because it's... Well, it exists. Sorry, I start again. This is a place I've wanted to go to for a long time partly because of the beautiful scenery around the... the border area with China the mountainous scenery there. But mainly because of the... this being the centre of the Russian space program. I'd been interested in space travel since I was a young boy and for me this... the defining moment of the 20th century was when Yuri Gagarin... 00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,700 took off and became the first man in space. So I was hoping to be able to visit the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan which is where he took off from. Though unfortunately the... the Kazakhs wouldn't let me in. It's a secret place. So I spent about nearly a month there and... during this time I met 00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,500 my wife to be. Yes, so I'd met this woman whom I was very fond of since this trip to Kazakhstan just seemed like a once in a lifetime event I realized the only way I was going to be able see her again was to bring her over to Iceland. I knew that it was something of a risk because the only way to bring her to Iceland was to marry her. But I thought I would take the risk. Marriage seemed to be an attractive prospect for me because I've felt that in many ways emotionally I had just not grown up very much during my time as a monk and I thought that marriage would have a maturing effect and if the marriage didn't work out, well that's just too bad. I was a Buddhist monk for a total of 16 years and then I decided to disrobe and got married. Unfortunately the marriage wasn't a... a total success and lasted only for about 5 months. So I'm currently separated and waiting for a divorce. Okay. A very good man. Robert! He was a... my knight with shining armor. I very very much loved him. Such a good man. He think different about love than I. For me it's more action. Very different than other men that I had in my life. Patient. Very patient. A little bit too much. No, I think I was very childish and he was.... he was very much like a man with very good manner. Well, yea, because me... I'm Russian girl with a lot of, how to say... energy very spontaning and you know when I met him he was... kind of slow. Thinking before he make all the small little steps. So I want him... I want to move him little bit and shake him much more. To be more like... yea, like me. I don't know. So long time ago, I just... He sometimes call me in my dream, I dream about him. And you know, he still calls me. He always remember my birthday, he calls me for my birthday. I think he's calling me because he wanna be... remembered like you and me. I think the real problem, the main problem was that... he was... still very deep inside of himself a monk. They don't have any responsability. Their life is so simple. And different than our life. So quiet. But well, I don't hate him because he was so nice and he never did anything wrong to me, you know. I am too much like, you know... let's go there and talk and this kind of people I was imagining they need some times for themself, you know. Do you like to be alone? Well, I'm you know, like old Russian people with a lot of... revolution inside ready to fight for even a cup of tea or something for nothing. Maybe sometimes it's too much. Actually he never pissed me off, really. Maybe he was too nice for me. So I'll always remember him as my... orange buddaman. No, what was unappealing to me about relationships is just the... the constant demands upon you by the woman. That you, for example, can't really be alone as much as you want to be which is not a good thing for someone like me who likes to be alone. And so basically I'm just too self-centered to be in a relationship. So after my marriage broke up I got into heavy-duty womanizing for a while and just sort of pushed anyone away that was trying to get too close to me because I didn't want that and eventually even the womanizing got boring so I gave that up too. I just went back to being sort of monkish a celibate. In many respects as a monk, I had not really grown up and that... being married and being involved in family life what would be a... helpful as a kind of maturing process. I've found that it was not very easy to adapt to married life after being a monk for so long. But with the wife there was... great problems in communication. It was partly linguistic because I speak hardly any Russian and she had only begun learning English about a year before. And partly cultural, I mean she's a Russian lady and they do have... somewhat different habits than we do. And it was partly simply that we had very different expectations. Well, it's a very big change from monastic life living as a monk in Iceland to the life that I'm living now. As a monk I was really very sheltered there is so much of Icelandic life that I just never saw or even knew about. And the program, schedule for each day was fixed the times when you ate and so on and now that I'm not a monk sometimes I'm at a bit of a loose end. Should I eat now or shouldn't I? It's a... life faces you with all kinds of choices and in a sense the monks life is easier because life is easier when you don't have to think very much or at least when your thinking is circumscribed within certain very narrow channels. You see, most of the differences are just obvious things. I mean I gotta earn my living now. I don't need to tell people this. On the other hand, in one sense my present life is much easier in that, I'm just an anonymous face in the street. That's quite comfortable. As a monk you never anonymous, everybody knows who you are. You're recognizable and you're... people are approaching you all the time. Where as now, if I walk down the street a person who doesn't know me is not going to approach me for any reason at all. And I rather like that, I enjoy just being obscure, being a nobody. Well, when they get... you know, when it becomes a very intimate relationship then sooner or later they want to move in with you or want you to move in with them and expect you to spend a lot of time with them. So, I mean a girlfriend who only wants to see you once a fortnight that would be okay. When you got to be with them all the time and you have your own projects and stuff and they mean more to you than sex and intimacy and all that then clearly you're not really the sort of person who should be let loose on women. You basically should just give that sort of stuff up otherwise you just gonna be hurting people. Yeah, in Thai soap operas there is some themes that you never get in the... you know, Western ones. Like... in Thailand it's quite acceptable for a man whose wife doesn't want sex as often as he does to get himself a mistress and she just comes and lives in the house and becomes known as a "mia noi" which means "minor wife". And she's like halfway between a family servant and a wife she's inferior to the wife but she's above the servants. So... a popular theme in the Thai soap operas is the conflicts between the mia noi and the other servants in the house. So, it's a bit different to Dallas and Coronation Street. It's not acceptable for the husband to pick his own mistress but he can get away with it as long as as long as it doesn't become public, he's very discreet. But if the public find out then the wife will feel she's lost face and then it will usually result in violence. So one of the most common crimes among women in Thailand is that they drug their husbands and cut their testicles off. In the middle of the night. Right, now sex... I just don't have that much of a sexual appetite. So whatever is expected of me is irrelevant, I mean... sex is just not that an important part of my life. Mostly it's just something I do because the woman wants it. I find it very interesting looking at the nightlife in Iceland, Reykjavík. But not very much enthusiasm for it. And during my first few months after I stopped being a monk I was going out regularly, just... mostly just watching, see what people do. But not really all that impressed with what they do. I hate the music. And nobody here seems to know how to drink like a gentleman. They just drink until they vomit on the floor or collapse. And I found also the sex is just too easy. I mean there's no skill involved in seducing people here, you just... A girl wants you she comes and nudges you and and if you want her then you walk out of the bar together. That's all there is to it. It seems kind of crude. You had two disadvantages of not being a monk anymore. How did I have to wear trousers? Which are really not too comfortable compared with the skirts that you wear as a monk. I have to remember always to pull up my zip. And the other thing is not having hair. Oh, shit... having... All right. And the second thing is having to have hair. Having to grow my hair and not... rather than being shaved. And... buying shampoos and combs and combing it every day and washing it 2 or 3 times a week. Whereas as a Buddhist monk it was so simple, you just shaved your head once a month. I am seriously thinking about shaving my head again, next year. No, it wasn't a swing of moods that I went through, it was just a swing of thoughts a change of priorities an assessment of what's important and what isn't and the things that I had thought would be worth giving up the monkhood for were no longer seen in that light. I found that the life of a lay person was very difficult to readjust to. Because of the habits of behaviour and habits of mind that I had developed during my time as a monk. In particular it was very difficult to to compete. Because I really didn't have much of a competitive spirit. Like, to get into the struggle for the money that people owed me when I was doing translation for them. And... well, various things like that. So, I didn't really fit in very well into that... into ordinary life. I had no idea beforehand whether I would or not but I thought there's at least a possibility, but as it was... I got to feel more and more alienated as time went by. Well, I left Iceland in December, 2004. and after that I just flew out here. I had in my mind a picture of the ideal monastery I was gonna look for. But before I started looking for it I came back to some of my old monasteries just to pay respects to the abbotts that I used to know. So we talked about this a bit and while we were talking some of my old friends in the monastery heard that I'd come back to visit and so they started turning up in the abbott's room bringing me... one monk came in with a begging bowl next monk came with a set of robes and by the times I finished talking I had the complete set of monk's requisites. So then my mind was sort of made up for me and a few days later I became a monk there... again. I mean, I wore it 16 years. I was only out for 4, so it was just like putting on an old coat, you know. To tell the truth I don't miss anything at all about lay life. I'm really glad to be back in the order again. Nothing at all, that I miss. Or maybe there must be something. Let me just think about it. Maybe there's something I miss. Have I missed anything? No, not really. Sorry. Can't think of anything that tempts me. I find it very difficult to evaluate just how I've been changed or effected by this period of being married. Some of the people I know say I have changed very much. That I seem more like a man now. But I haven't noticed any... anything like this in myself. I don't know what they mean. I can't say that it's really given me any better understanding of what people mean by love. I mean, it's common that people make a distinction between love and infatuation but I'm still inclined to regard love as just... the difference between love and infatuation is being just a matter of degree not a difference in kind. That love is just a label we give to an infatuation that's strong enough to make you want to stay with a person for some time or marry them. I was still rather inclined to think that love, whatever it is, is something that people overrate. They make too much of an emotional overinvestment in it. But I'm maybe wrong. Going to something else now. I'm not good on this subject. Ask me about Buddhist logic or something. Well, all religions seem to agree that the world is a veil of tears. That things as they are, are not completely ideal could be better. But then I disagree as to precisely what is the cause of the unsatisfactory nature of things and where Buddhism differs from the diagnoses of other religions, there's according to Buddhism no thing that is permanent anywhere. Everything that arises must pass away and that includes ourselves and it means that there is no part of ourself and no part of the world in which we live that can last forever. So the anatta teaching rejects both the idea of an eternal soul and it rejects the idea of an eternal god. And indeed it says that these ideas of an eternal soul the idea that there's a part of you that will last forever and the idea of a god that can that has the power to save you 01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,500 because he's infinitely powerful and because he lives forever are among the things that are obstructive to freedom from suffering which is what Buddhism is concerned with. I have no definite plans for the future I can't talk about any particular plan so I can only talk about what is quite likely to happen. Apart from growing old, getting sick and dying. I will probably be working for the next 3 years on a quite a big translation project I'm doing. Every few months I'll take off to the forest and go and meditate in some quiet place. And I expect that'll point to what I'll be doing for the next one or two decades. So, no really big ambitions, just this... just a very focused little ambition of... 01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,200 reducing lust, hate and delusion, which is what the Buddhist teaching is really all about. It's just something I don't give any thought to nowadays I mean, I'm not in a position of being a councilor to anybody or a teacher. So I don't have to try and understand how other people live. I'm really quite focused now on my work doing translations of Buddhist texts from Pali and working on my own practice. So I don't really give any thought to questions of love doesn't interest me anymore. My aim really is dispassion. Freedom from all passion. Reality is that whatever rises, passes away and is not self. There is nothing worth clinging on to. And so a life that is based upon any other principle, that there is something worth having somewhere or something worth being is one that's based on delusion and that will cause suffering. So, if you want to be free of suffering then you hold on to nothing you settle down nowhere.
