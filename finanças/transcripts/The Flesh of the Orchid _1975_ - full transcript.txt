Come back tomorrow. Dumb fool! Not coming down today? You didn’t let me show you the bathroom... or the bedrooms. I’m fine here. What’s your name now? Delage. Louis Delage. The first name? What do you do for a lay? I must be going. Where? I’ll be away for a few days. - You taking me? - No. - Want a clean shirt? - Cut the shit! Taking me? Goodbye, Mother. - Will he go away? - No, he’s staying. I’m leaving, I can’t stay here alone. - You’re working now? - No, I’ve never worked. And the horses? All my father’s. - Your mother? - She’d rather never have met you! What’s eating you? I’m just fed up. Are you going to keep running? I’d like a car like this. I’d sit in the back and watch the bums... They’d look at me, too. Look at that! You crazy? Don’t stop! He’s dead! See his eyes? Hey! Come on, let’s get out of here! Were you in the truck? What happened? Where you headed? And you? - I’ll take you to a doctor. - No. Who was that guy there? Take me with you. I told you not to stop. Hotels make me puke, especially this sort. My name’s Claire. Claire what? I’ll take this one. I don’t want to stay long. I haven’t a dime. This dump will kill me. - Some more wine? - No, thank you. Even your place was better. Where are we? She’s bleeding. Coming back? You’re not eating. It’s too late. I’m not hungry now. Is Ostend in Belgium? Where is she? She went up to bed. Did she talk about the accident? Wait for me? I don’t know. Look over there, the other one’s alone. Good evening. Well, so you’ve come! Anyone he owes money to? It’s all he can do: borrow. A real punk. You asleep? It’s hot in this hotel... May I take this off? Are you alone, too? I’ll keep you company. Perhaps we could get acquainted. You’re not afraid of me? I won’t hurt you. On the contrary... I do like your looks. Gently now, take that off. I opened a new club. It hurts, it hurts! Is that you, Louis? Help me, Louis! Help me, it hurts! She had a knife on her. Where is she? How do I know? It hurts, Louis... I’ll never see them... never! - See who? - The two brothers. The knife throwers... I won’t see them. - You’re calling? - A doctor! No! I don’t want a doctor! Is it the Berekian brothers? His mother must be cleaned out, since he sold everything. Now, he’s here with a girl. Look! There she is! I said I was opening a new club. - I’m going to wash. - My jacket? She wanted me to come. She let me kiss her. She wanted me to... Once they decide on it, they kill. They’ve followed me everywhere. No one can tell me about them. They never left a witness alive. - I know. - This is bad! We need a hospital! No, not a hospital! Why do they want you? Because of Blancard. He was bullshit, so one night, I shot up his club and got a guy. Is he doing time? I busted him, he was after me. He got in the Berekians. It’s been a year now. Don’t leave me! I must join my friends. What happened upstairs? You don’t change! About that loan you needed... Pay back, then we’ll see... I’m looking for a barman. Some salmon? My husband adores salmon. I’ve pulled it all down. I got a loan from UCA. I bought this wine to help a guy. The labels weren’t right and they made a big scene. I’d tell a story, but I might not finish it. He never finishes anything. I’ll show you the 15 new bathrooms. We’re the last generation which was taught any moral ideal. But not always the same one. Is someone there? Who’s there? Berekian. Gyula and Josef Berekian. Even 3,000 would be a help. You pay back first! See you in 6 months. It’s not hard to make money, you know that. So you’re still here! He looked at us! Have we ever left a witness? Are we leaving? I lived alone in a small house. Nearby, there was a larger house. I think it was empty. Louis, the horses are hungry. I know they’re hungry! I haven’t time now. Go to bed! A storm’s coming. They fed me at 11 and at 6.30. The lights were off at 9. I wasn’t tired at 9... Neither were they. There were large cages outside. Was this place a prison? I was sure you would forget me. They always forget me. I don’t have to defend myself with you. I’m so often wrong. I suggest we sleep in turns. Wrap yourself in this blanket. It’s going to freeze. When is it daylight? Later and later. Put the seat down. Take off your shoes. Not asleep? Thinking of the girl... What are they doing now? You think too much, Josef. Must think of something. Go to sleep! Can’t sleep in a car now. The two brothers worked in a circus. They were news after the war, I thought they’d retired. They killed him... He was very beautiful. I panicked... I should’ve called someone. They’ll think it’s me. I must get away! Go away! You can leave me here. An employee will be coming, I’ll wait... for the animals. I’ll go when he’s here. A man used to visit me. He had dirty nails. He was very strong. I’ve lived there for years. And before that? Before, I was ill. I’d done such silly things. I can remember well. I was too proud. I’m cold. Are they after you, too? - Why? - Because I went away. Can I go with you? That house... It wasn’t really a prison. Where are we? Go to sleep, darling. I’ll open up right away. - Why not with them? - We’re fine here. Where was she? How should I know? Is there some coffee? George! Take a walk in the park. A walk will do you good! I’m doing all this for you! Yes, she’s gone. I told Mrs. Wegener on the phone. She tried to blind my gardener. And I’ve been told not to call the police. She doesn’t want it known. It’s as if I was running a brothel. Why call the police? It is your fault! Such a very bad moment, I’ve just sold my house... Everything is in a warehouse. We are living like gypsies. Yes, I understand. You do see that it was for her good with all the medical guarantees. She became restless recently. But then this man started enjoying it. He went every morning, she couldn’t take it. Wounded him in the face and disappeared. Just one question... She’s free now. Suppose she saw a specialist, a psychiatrist, who examined her... Would he insist on bringing her back? She may come by herself. My brother died recently. He named me sole guardian. It was only sensible. My niece must return and stay here. It is better for everyone. Especially for her. Where could she go in her state? She’s in the way. It would be better to forget... all that’s been said. If we were not discreet, Sir, we would have closed long ago! She was well treated. She must come back! What are you doing? Have you finished? What does she look like? Poor girl! I would never have recognized her. Our torment! I’ll never let such a fortune fall into the hands of a mental case. You’re shaking. Mother must be up. We must be going. Get some money? I’ll repay you. Take care of yourself. Get in quickly! Watch it! Careful with the steering wheel! Is a car following us? - Can’t see one. - No houses? Far away. Where are we? I don’t know! No road or track? Slow down! - We just passed a small track. - Take it! Go and get someone, a doctor... I can’t move. Did you really mean that I’m not ill? I should not be locked up? I’ll explain one day, not now. Be careful, they must be after us. Excuse me, where can I find a doctor? - Are you ill? - Not for me. For a wounded man. Down the road. He’s bleeding. I know a doctor. I’ll take you there. - Is it far? - No, don’t worry. - Where’s the man? Is it far? - No. Not far. It’s an old factory. I need a doctor for a wounded man! - Do you understand? - I can’t go out. I’m a sick man. Go to the hospital, I can’t help. Come here! Excuse me, she’s a friend. Hurry! He’s going to die. I know where he is. I’ll take you. She is very rich. She’s very sick... Almost blinded the gardener. We’ll make you a cup of coffee. Come and sit down here. Sit down, we are here to help you. No, I must go. I’ll manage... Does my eye bother you? No, it’s a mistake. I shouldn’t have come. I am a good doctor. We’ll look after you. Let me go! Open the door! Now Claire, what’s the matter? You can’t leave us! Don’t you know me? Henry! Do something! We’ll look after you like we did before. No, let her go, Elisabeth. I don’t want that money. Just think about the gardener... Quickly call the clinic! She has been found! You must be tired, Elisabeth! - So quickly? - They move fast! Come in, gentlemen. You were quick. This way, please. I’ll go first. - The doctor... - I didn’t like the telephone call. This Wegener story means nothing. I read about it in the press. As a doctor, my opinion is... Henry, the gentlemen know what to do. The Wegener girl? - The one who...? - Where is she? - Not here. - Listen... She’s not here! She was here, but she’s gone. And the car? She left without the car. They came for her. Doctor, do understand me. It’s not a matter of money... but of family morality. My niece is ill, that’s why I’m here. So that what my brother left me is not in incapable hands. Newspapers, factories-- It’s cold here! This needs careful handling. Gentlemen, don’t stay here. His daughter inherited. She’s depressive, has breakdowns. As a doctor, you’ll understand. You know, money is always suspicious. My brother’s success deserved some punishment. A rich man may not easily enter the realm of Heaven. Her place is in an asylum. It’s either she or I. We must hurry. I have a house near Zurich. My dear brother left it to me. I must go there. Depressed, perhaps, but gone! Two men came for her. When? 5 or 10 minutes ago. Which two men? I never saw them before. They were well dressed. - Foreigners maybe. - But it’s criminal. What was she doing here? A wounded man she loved. Loved! What nonsense! She is incapable of loving. Where is this wounded man? I can take you there. Why hand her over to strangers? They were armed. She’s lost us enough time! Where is she? She doesn’t know. - Let’s go to Italy. - No! I want you to find this witness. Someone got here first. You recognize her? She’s my cousin. She’s been kidnapped. It’s partly your fault. You knew she was very rich. She told you when you made love? They slept together? They must have tried! What did she see in him? Well, if you know a bit about women, after being shut up for years... Even after 15 years, I wouldn’t sleep with him! The two men... - What’s the matter? - ...who took your niece, they’re here. Shut the door quickly! We are not here, understood? No dealing with those people. We can’t expect to be trusted. I can’t ask banks or my buyers for anything... while my family has a mad woman on the run! It’s so simple. They want me, but took your niece... Arrange an exchange. Don’t hesitate! Go and tell them, you have nothing else to do. A wounded man would go to a doctor or a hospital. These are fine buildings. Annexes? Yes, that’s right. This way, please. Is it true... that you killed your partner... with a stab in the throat, in the middle of the show? My mother met a man who knows you... but she’s got him hidden! We’re in Zurich next week, in an old family house. I could tell you where. He will be there, too. Who? The wounded man. Where is Lady Vamos? Up in the garden. I don’t want any of your trouble. She’s a very rich neurasthenic. She escaped from a clinic. You won’t have any trouble. She’s the Orchid girl. Madame won’t like it. We’ll wash and then leave for Switzerland for a while. You said they wouldn’t come back. Who is she? The Orchid’s daughter. You remember? - Is that true? - They said so. The Orchid... Alcide... If she’s gone when we come back, you’d better not be here, either! Some say they’re young, others – old. In fact... they’re quite ageless. I look older than my age... because I’m so intelligent. There isn’t a witness alive... except me. They really will kill you. Of course... it really frightens me. So much to tell about you all, if it only interested me. That’s him. Pedro, that’s Pedro! Here’s Alcide. He was very elegant. Here are the Berekians. Dolores, their partner. Oh, my God, the poor girl! That’s Gyula. No, it’s Josef. Yes, Josef, but you wouldn’t recognize him, he’s changed so much. That’s poor Dolores. We worked in the same circus. I am Lady Vamos. You’re too young to remember... but I was famous. That’s not us! You wouldn’t believe... all the lovers I had. I was a star... a real one. You need to be an artist to bear my cross. “The Orchid’s daughter”... what does it mean? Nothing! What do they want of me?! Why does everyone hate me?! Why am I always shut away?! I don’t know. Sometimes, you have to forget. Why do they say I’m ill? I don’t know. This man, called Wegener, either a Swiss or a German, had a very beautiful wife, much younger than him. One day, she was kidnapped by a bandit. She lived with him and, perhaps, she worked with him. It was end of ’44, when circuses started up, I stopped my act. Why? She jumped out of a window. She had just had a child. You! I don’t believe you. He would have been shot... You’re right. He was shot leaving a subway some time later. I must shut you up now, you’ve been out too long. Alcide will be coming home. Did those two men know my father? They all knew each other. Josef and Gyula were another type. Your father loved orchids... he left one on each job. Help me get away! Don’t ask me to do that! I had a dream... I was half naked, kneeling on the banks of a river. They were all on the other side, with guns. They were going to shoot... I was thinking... I was about to die... and there would be no one to cry. Your hair is white. I must do the roots. Still nothing? No, they haven’t arrived. Don’t make such a noise. The dress is finished. Just try it on. They’ll kill him. It fits well. - He said: “I’ll take you.” - It fitted me well, too. He had a strong perfume. He cleaned my wound. We made love all night. He knew why I was shut up, he was going to tell me. He had promised. I know where they are, I must get there. You have been loved... you told me so. Don’t let him die! My make-up box is on the sewing machine. There’s some money in it. The station is on the left. Take a night train to cross the border. The make-up box is a present. Aren’t you coming? No, I’ve been very happy here. Don’t be afraid of me. We’re the same, you know. We shouldn’t hurt each other. You can hide it from anyone else, but I know! I don’t want to talk to you. Call it what you want... but you’re like me. You’re as mad as I am. I never make a mistake! So many memories here... I didn’t remember it this way. It seemed less isolated. The trees stop the noise, you can’t hear anything. Aren’t there any servants? - No caretaker? - A harmless old man. He lives some way off. He’ll be here at 7, if he got my cable. What a mess this place is! Put him in the pink room, on the first floor. You remember your room? - Can’t I sleep with you? - No. - Do the doors lock? - Certainly not. Absolutely no one will come. This shivering won’t stop! Hurry up and light a fire! There is someone asleep here! Some caretaker who lets anyone in! Wake him up! Get moving. What are you waiting for? There’s nothing to see. Leave her alone, she needs peace. She’s awake! She wants to go. Don’t let her out! Lock her up! Careful, she’s dangerous! Lock everything. The ambulance has gone. They always lock the doors, they never let me go out. You promised to tell me... Why did you come here? I recalled the house. The two knife throwers are looking for me. I thought you’d be dead. Tell me what happened! Just imagine I’m already dead... His wife said he left a while ago. - No one knows? - No, Mrs. Wegener. What’s he up to, it’s 7.30. Get dinner! Did you take your pills? I’m alright. Have you anything to say? Nothing. Tell me what you have to say. I can almost see your father. I hated it when he did that. I had you too late. We don’t understand each other. You’re an old couple’s child. Robert, Raymond, it will soon be ready. The line is dead. What is going on? The caretaker? We must leave! Why stand there? Leave everything! Go and get the car! May I know what is going on? Shut everything! Hurry up! The doors, the windows... Quick! Get nails, planks, hurry! I’m sure they’ve attacked! The one behind the house fired. The other one will soon be here. You never hear them come, they arrive. They have gone to the end of the world. You’ve got no guts! You’ll be on your own. All locked up? Not the door under the stairs. Get a chair and sit in front of it. Where are you going? Arnaud! Come back! As a kid, I had all the money I wanted, and only the best clothes. I wanted you to talk about me. I had lots of friends, they have forgotten me. All that was absurd. A young fool, now I’m a little older. I’m going... I’m going to leave you. Get out. You can’t help me! Miss Wegener... you don’t know me. The time is not well chosen. But how to keep quiet? Sooner or later, circumstances... will force you to make decisions. I’ll tell you everything. Because of some people’s greed, you’ve been shut up for years. The Wegener fortune is yours. I knew they would find me. I knew it... I’m telling you, the fortune is yours. The paper? - The factories? - Everything. Houses, forests... They are all mine? All of it. Intact, but so badly managed. There was talk of a sell-out. It would be a mistake. Thank God you’re here! Now for a reconciliation. Robert? Yes? Can you hear me? Poor Robert! Are you there? Are you afraid? Yes, Mrs. Wegener. Please! I’ll give you what you want. You’ve nothing against me! You’re looking for the wounded man! He’s upstairs... in the room at the top of the stairs. He’s up there. Can you hear me? He’s up there, with the mad girl! That’s for you! - Our last job... I’m finished. - Don’t stay here! Let’s go by the back! Come on, you bum! There’s someone there. I’m blind, she’s blinded me! Women are tougher. We all hope so! It all still belongs to her. Organized schizos run many banks. Can we see her? Tomorrow, she’s under sedation. I preferred your hair long. She won’t remember you. I won’t be long. Don’t stay here. What can you do? She’ll sleep now. First meeting is at 5. - Is she feeling better? - She’s very well. - Did she get it all? - Yes, yes! I left this morning, my flowers are dead. I wanted to thank you... Where are you going? - To see a lady. - No more visits today. Another day. Another day? I can’t, I work. - I’ve got a job. - It’s too late now. Please, sir! I’ve got to see her! I know! Move along, lady! She entered the treasure room... Saw the old lady counting the gold piled up on the floor. So he said: “I’ll kill... “the one who betrayed... “and take back her head.” Yes, I slept very well. A beautiful day... - It would be necessary to-- - I’m starting work immediately. No, I’m not alone. Hello? I feel very well... very, very well. I feel very strong. It’s all clear to me now. It’s nothing... I’ve forgotten many things. Him too, I’ve forgotten him. I just want to fight now. I feel so well. I understand... - We’re back in business.. - We must act. Act? Of course, some action-- Money must bring returns!
