Rainbow village used to be the most beautiful villagein Thailand. Until a terrible flood destroyed the whole village 50 years ago. Just as the village was about to be swept away by the flood, A handsome man named Pong, who, after saying goodbye to the love of his life, led a group of four strong men to the river! They held up a crumbling wall with their bodies, so that the villagershad time to flee. In the end, they successfully saved the lives of many villagers. But sacrificed their lives. To commemorate them, the village chief built five bronze statues by the river. So that everyone would remember these five brave men. Wow, these statues look ridiculously life-like! Are you sure a small village has so much budget? Let me search again. This one is very handsome! He is Pong. He's the strongest! Watch out, everyone! They're zombies! It says here. After the flood, this crazy chief asked a priest to turn the five of them into zombies! He makes them do hard labour in the morning. - At night, he even forces them to... - Shut up! There are no zombies here. That is fake news from the internet! There are no zombies here! You shouldn't spread fake news! Unbelievable! You're not welcome here. Go away. Hey, my phone! My phone! Huang Zhen Zhen! Can you stop spouting nonsense? I went through a lot of trouble to arrange the photo-shoot. And now you've offended the chief. What if he chases us away? - But I... - Okay, enough said. The sun is about to set, we don't have much time! All of you change into your bikinis! We'll meet back here in half an hour for the photo-shoot! Go, go! Quickly! Go! Oh no! Pong. Thank you for saving me! TWO WEEKS AGO MISS SINGAPURA SEMI FINALS Which part of yourself are you most unhappy about? A confident woman is a beautiful woman. I'm very happy about every part of my body. My legs are not long enough, my waist is not slim enough. My breasts are not big enough. My neck is too short. My face is not pretty. But so what? To me, the most important thing is to be real! I am the real deal from head to toe! Although there are many parts that I'm not satisfied with, I don't mind at all! Applause, please! Hello, we are the Miss Singapura finalists. - Please come this way. - Thank you. Give me more smiles. Come on watch your expression! That's right. Okay, come. Yes! That's it. Bring out your emotions! Smile! More. Okay, go. Great, come on. Very good! Come on, faster. That's right. That's the way! That's right! Come on. Beautiful. Why did you take part in the Miss Singapura pageant? When I was in school, my teacher looked down on me. When I was working, my boss looked down on me. Even when I wanted to join Miss Singapura, my mother objected. She thinks I'm wasting my time. Since I was young, no matter what I did, everyone would look down on me. You look down on me too, don't you? Yes, I may not be highly educated, I may be loud. Everyone calls me "Ah Lian". But so what? Can't an "Ah Lian" have dreams? The more you look down on me, the more I will prove to you that I can make it! If a person does not have any dreams, then they are no different from a zombie. Don't you agree? Am I right? Yes! Thank you everyone! Thank you! Huang Zhen Zhen! You can do it! Come on! Mr. Lim, please don't do this. Let go of me! If you don't, I'm going to scream! I promise, you will definitely be the winner. - No! Let go of me! - I swear! Help! Help! Let her go, you pervert! - Zhen Zhen! He... - I know! He wants to rape you! Watch what you say! She seduced me! I didn't seduce him! He wanted to rape me! Okay. You tell the rest to inform the police! - Go! - Bing Bing! Listen to me! What do you have to say? Whatever it is, you can say it to a judge! - You are going to jail! - Bing Bing! Get out of my way! Help! I can't swim! Help! Tonight, I'll take two of them! Auntie! I'll take all! Auntie! Please help me! I feel a sudden chill. Why? Stop chatting. We're already late. - Let's go! - What happened to me? Auntie. Auntie! This one is so handsome! Do you like that? Why are you hitting my benefactor? Pong! She's touching you inappropriately. Why don't you fight back? You were a great hero. Why did you end up like this? Even if you are a zombie, you should be a zombie with dignity! I'm so disappointed in you! What happened? What is this place? How dare you! You disobeyed me. Mummy's going to spank you! Pervert! Just you try! I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Idiot, let's see if you dare to hit anyone ever again! You on the outside! You arevery difficult to control! Kill ghosts on sight! Kill demons on sight! Freeze! What do you want to smuggle? Guns. Knives. Drugs. Firecrackers. Adult DVDs. And lastly, chewing gum. - Where do you want to smuggle them to? - Singapore. - Singapore? - Yes. - No way! - Why? - Singapore is very strict. - But I'm already here. - Why can't you do it this time? - No way. - I came all the way here. - Just leave. - You are wasting my time. - Go away. - Leave. - You are crazy! Singapore. Singapore. I thought I told you to leave. Why are you back? - Pong? - Oh, friends? I never thought I would see you again. Uncle, watch where you're touching! This is great! Anyway, what are you doing here? I thought the priest had you kept away. Where to? Singapore? - Singapore? - Yes. Singapore? Singapore? Yes. Help me, please! Okay. Because I still remember, fifty years ago, you saved my life. My grandfathercould destroy monsters. My father could slay zombies. I can't even catch cockroaches. But today, that will change. My life will change. Today, I will find my power! Today, I will find my dignity. Today, I will... SINGAPORE Are you Huang Zhen Zhen? - What? - I've come from hell! You climbed all the way up from down there? I have climbed 18 levels. It's very, very tiring! From now onwards, you are a wandering ghost! I'm a wandering ghost? Because you have an unfulfilled wish, so you can't die in peace. If you can fulfil your wish in 49 days, you can be reincarnated. If you can't fulfil your wish in 49 days, then you will become a puff of black smoke. And vanish into thin air! Who made this rule? I died at such a young age, this is so unfair. Now I have to go through so much trouble to get reincarnated. Why are the heavens so unfair to me? Fairness? You want to talk to me about fairness? I have to climb 18 levels from hell every day to explain everything to all you wandering ghosts. Is that fair for me? Why is there no lift? Why is there no escalator? Why do I have to do the same old thing every day? Why is this my retribution? You can be reincarnated. I can't be reincarnated. Fairness? Everything is unfair! There are many things in life that you can't change. You need to learn to let go. Now that you're dead. If you can't even let go, won't your life as a ghost be very miserable? I have not achieved my dreams, I still have to see my mother and my BFFs one last time. How can I let go? Zhen Zhen. Today is the 7th day since your death. Do come back and eat. Mum has cooked many dishes. They are all your favourites. You must eat more. Ever since you took part in that beauty pageant, mum hasn't had much chance to cook for you. Now, there won't be any more chances. Who are you? Mum! I'm Zhen Zhen. I've come back! Are you looking for Zhen Zhen? She is not with us anymore. Mum, I am Zhen Zhen. I'm standing right here. Can't you see me? Can't you hear me? Mum! Zhen Zhen's death has caused you so much grief. You must be a close friend of hers. Today is the 7th day since her death, come and eat with her. She has always liked company. Why aren't you eating? You don't like the food? No! These areall my favourite dishes! I'll eat! I'll eat! Hey, why can't you bend your arm? Never mind, you don't have to eat if you don't want to. I want to eat! I will eat! Have you known Zhen Zhen for a long time? Zhen Zhen. 3 months ago, she ran away from home. That day, if I hadn't hit her, she wouldn't have left. And she wouldn't have died. It's all my fault. Zhen Zhen. You must really hate me. I've let you down. It's all my fault. I should've listened to you. It's all my fault. What are you doing? Don't be afraid! I just want to give you a hug! Oh no! Zhen Zhen. I'm finished! This time, I'm doomed! I'm going to kill you! Mum, calm down! Make sure it is slip-resistant, then you won't fall. But, more importantly, you have to pick yourself up from where you fell! Thank you for your encouragement, Hu Ge! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have picked up boxing. You will always be a champion to me! That's all in the past now. What's the point in bringing it up? There is only one thing that I want to do now while I'm still alive. I'll be content if I can lead a comfortable life every day. Come here. Don't give up. I believe in you. I believe you can beat that Xiao Lang, because he has a fatal weakness. What is his weakness? His weakness is he has no weakness! This is what I call a champion! You just won a match yesterday, and you are here early today to train! You are amazing! You should rest first! I'll make a cup of tonic tea for you. Very fast. Mr. Lang wants to practice. Go clean up the ring. Come! Let's fight! Are you scared? Do you remember our first time? I beat you up so badly, you can't compete anymore. You can only do menial work every day. I made you forever useless. All the best! And I wish you good health! Great! Let's work hard together, spur each other on, and keep going! That's enough! This is my final warning. Stop bullying him! He is my brother. You touch him again, and you are dead! Let me warn you, I'm a very good fighter! I'm a fan of Sailor Moon! Be careful, or I will punish you on behalf of the moon! You're back? You really came back? I missed you! She is now trapped inside this zombie, unable to escape. Oh, poor thing! Thank goodness you can hear the dead. Otherwise, nobody would understand him. Now, the most important thing is to figure out how to help her fulfill her dreams, within 49 days. Otherwise, she'll... Tonight is the pageant finals! I want to thank my dad and mum. Thank you for your encouragement and support. Daddy, Mummy, I love you! Huang Zhen Zhen! What do I do now? The pageant is over! The next seasonwill be next year! Moreover, I'm trapped in this zombie. It is so stiff! How am goingl to fulfill my dreams? What should I do? Hello everyone! The annual Mr. Perfect is back! If you are between21 to 28 years old, Handsome, manly, and smart! Remember21st November, 10am to 4pm. Come for the auditionat Man City! That's right! You are the Mr. Perfect we are looking for! Come now! We are waiting for you! Hey, the audition is tomorrow. Where are you going? He has taken control of me. Quick, hold on to me! Pong, where are you going? Kill ghosts on sight! Kill demons on sight! Pong! Kill demons on... Pong! Quick, Pong, run! Roger, proceeding. What's the matter? Someone made a police report that there is a mad priest trying to slash people with a sword. - Let's go check it out now. - Okay. Hey! What happened? Looks like she's drunk. - There really is a priest! - And he is holding a wooden sword! Police! Freeze! Put down your sword! Stop right there! - What is he saying? - Speak Mandarin! Kill ghosts on sight! Kill demons on sight! Blood! Perfect timing! Kill ghosts on sight! Kill demons on sight! Is Zhen Zhen here? Zhen Zhen is here. Let me see if she's hurt. Bai Bai, I feel I'll turn into a zombie any time. What should I do? Where is Pong? I don't know. Where exactly is Pong? I chased him away. Why? Now that you have left his body, he is just an out of control zombie who will bite anyone! Pong won't bite anyone. He bites. Pong bit Lai Lai by accident because he was probably trying to protect me! If he could bite Lai Lai yesterday, he can bite me today. He will probably bite the whole neighbourhood tomorrow! Yes! After I was bitten by him, I felt feverish, my skin itched, even my teeth became sharp. What are you doing? Oh, yes, I may turn into a zombie anytime! If Lai Lai turns into a zombie, will you chase him away? Answer me! Will you chase him away? You guys are talking about me, right? Tell him! Zhen Zhen asked me, if you turned into a zombie, would I chase you away? Would you? You won't, right? You would? Stop! No! You see! Both of you were scared stiff just by imagining it, think about Pong being out there by himself. Watch Zhen Zhen. Ghosts are light, the wind would blow her away. But, I can't see her. Okay, I'll try my best. Bai Bai, why don't you fix your air-con? It's very hot. I can't take it any more! No! I'm sorry, Zhen Zhen! I didn't know it's so windy outside that it would blow you away! I'm so sorry! - Don't open the window again! - Got it! - Watch her carefully! - Okay! Are you alright? Hold it. I'm sorry! I can't take it anymore! No! Sorry, Zhen Zhen! I didn't do it on purpose. Why didn't you hold on to Zhen Zhen just now? I can't see Zhen Zhen, how can I hold on to her? Looks like I have to take you somewhere. Where? Bai Bai, why did you bring me to a goat farm? To get goat tears. What is it for? To open your third eye! - Third eye? - Don't you want to see Zhen Zhen? If you opened my third eye, I won't just see Zhen Zhen. I'll see all the ghosts! Do you want this or not? I don't believe you won't cry! It doesn't care. I'm eating your kind, I don't believe you won't cry. It's ignoring you. Bai Bai, looks like she's enjoying it. She won't cry. Now, the one who's most upset, should be the one opposite. You're touching his wife's teats right in front of him. You are so cruel! You made him angry! He is really crying! Zhen Zhen. It's okay. I'll hug you. I can't find Pong! I can't find him either! What do we do now? Pong. Pong? Pong! Pong! Hello! Are you his family? Who are you? I'm Joe. I'm one of the producers of Mr. Perfect. I saw him on the road just now. And I find him handsome, fit, and perfect! So I brought him to the audition. Hello! Hey! What's your name? Hello. You brought him here? Why did you bring a mute? - For publicity! - You call this publicity? Are we that short of money? There are many ways to do publicity. But you have to bring a mute! Do you think this is the right publicity? Even if I'm wrong, you don't have to be so fierce. Fierce? Let me tell you! If this were the past, I would have kicked you downstairs by now! Hey you! If you don't want to speak up, can you leave? Do you see the exit sign over there? Follow the sign and get out. Hey! Hey, he can't move, but you can right? Yes, boss! Infuriating! - Wasting my time. - Yes. It is so hard to find such a handsome, and perfect man like me in Singapore. You have to go, my boss is angry! Let's go. Come, calm down. Good luck will come to those with a good temper. - Let's eat! - Yes, let's eat! Let's go! The most important thing now is to figure out how to help her fulfil her dreams within 49 days. If you can't fulfil your wish in 49 days, then you will become a puff of black smoke and vanish into thin air! He danced very hard, and he danced very seriously. I could feel that he was dancing for love! It was so noble. When he finished, he almost stripped off his clothes. That's why a serious man is the most handsome. A man who dares to strip is even more adorable! So we've decided to invite him to take part in this year's, Mr. Perfect! By the way, I still don't know his name. His name is Pong. - Pong? - Pong Yu Yan. With this pair of gold boots, you don't have to worry about the wind again! Now that you're a ghost, I bet you really missed this nice beer! Cheers! Pong, why don't you show them your dance? Show them how good you are. That's right, just show us a little. Be a good boy now. Dance for us. Big brother is herefor laundry.

How long are you going to stare at that panty? Oh, he wants to give you flowers. I didn't expect a zombie to be good at courting girls. Let me help you. Here you go. Thank you. Oh no! Why did you kill the mood? What's the matter? You can't possess Pong. You can't control him anymore. How are you going to compete? - Teddy bear! - Teddy bear? Teddy bear? March on the spot, march! Left, right, left right. Left, right, left right. Prepare to stop! Zhen Zhen, we found the teddy bear. What should we perform for the semi-final? Cheers! LIVE: MR. PERFECT SEMI-FINALS LIVE BROADCAST This is great! Zombie, I won't let you off so easily. Ghost-lady, you are doomed! Kill ghosts on sight! Kill demons on sight!

A little faster. DREAMS COUNTDOWN TO REINCARNATION: 2 DAYS Here. Thank you. Hit me. - Got you. - Naughty! I'll hit you. I'll hit you. - Let's go. - No. Sit down. Hello. It's been a while. That's why I say, choosing a boyfriend is like choosing groceries at the market. If you can't find the best, top quality lobster, you can still make do with the lousiest salted fish. Don't go overboard. You stole her boyfriend and blacklisted her. Yes, I've blacklisted her. Simply because I can! Because I am the top makeup artist, and she is just a lowly makeup artist... Oh, pardon me, you are a mortuary cosmetologist! The whole world knows you slept your way to the top. You have no real skill at all! If I had no skill, then how did I get myself such a catch? He is not a catch, he's just leftover. And you, pick up the scraps that's left behind, like a stray dog. In English, it's called bitch! Hey, how dare you hit her! Baby! Why didn't you fight back? Does it hurt? You still miss him, don't you? Why can't you forget him? You've never been in love. You wouldn't understand. I understand one thing. I care about you more than he does. If you really cared, why didn't you fight back just now? Okay. I'll pick a fight with him now! I'll take Pong with me, I believe we can beat him. Why are you taking Pong? He is bigger than me, how is it fair if I fight him? Pong is a better match. Stop finding excuses for yourself. I'm not finding excuses! Technically, I'm the one controlling Pong, so I'm still the one fighting him. Stop lying to yourself. I'm not lying to myself. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me! Give it to me! Are you going to give it to me? Hey, what are you doing? You're smashing Pong to bits. The finals are tomorrow. He mustn't get hurt. I'm sorry, Zhen Zhen. Please don't scold Bai Bai. I was too impulsive. I wanted to use Pong to fight Xiao Lang, so I... You want Pong to fight Xiao Lang? Are you mad? But he was unfaithful to Bai Bai! You fight him one-on-one, and beat him with your own strength! I'm not his match! How can I fight him? You want him to kill me? As long as you have this loser mindset, you will always be a loser. Can you not call him a loser every time you argue with him? It's very hurtful. He even needs you to speak up for him, he is a downright loser. You've always been the best at arguing. You excelled in arguing with your boss, arguing with your boyfriend, arguing with your mum! When you lose the argument, you'd run away from home, - and ask me to take you in. - How about you? That woman stole your boyfriend and your job, yet you didn't do anything, except run away. You are not a loser, you are a coward! Zhen Zhen, that's enough! You are also a coward! You dare not confess your love for her. You just pine for her quietly. You are not being noble, you are just useless! I'm useless? I'm the one to help you control Pong with the teddy bear, so you can compete. And now you call me a loser? You are the loser! Pong! Look what you did! Pong, get up. Pong, get up. Pong! DREAMS Tomorrow is the finals. How are we going to compete without the teddy bear? You've destroyed the bear, and also our dreams! Do you understand? DREAMS Do you know why I always say that a person without dreams is no different from a zombie? It is because I feel that a person without dreams is pitiful. I used to be someone without any dreams. Back then, I would wake up every day, And not want to go to work. DREAMS. DON'T THINK. JUST CHASE! I would wish I was sick so that I could take sick leave, and not have to go to work. At work, I was like a zombie. Souless and lifeless. Every day, I'd wait to knock off from work. Every day, I lived without purpose. Sometimes, I would ask myself, are the heavens making life difficult for me? Or is this a test? Why am I doingthe same thing every day? Why is my talent not being recognised? I obviously hated my job. Why did I nothave the guts to quit and try something new? Why is my life so full of regrets? All these questions. And no answer. I can only say, having dreams is important. Do you understand? Stop dancing. Stop dancing! I said, stop dancing! I am telling you to stop dancing now! I know you tried very hard. For the competition tomorrow. Just do your best, okay? Tomorrow is my 49th day deadline. I may get reincarnated, or I may vanish into thin air. Regardless, we might not see each other again? Thank you for always protecting me. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for everything you've done. I will never forget you. Thank you. Thank you. COUNTDOWN TO REINCARNATION: 1 DAY Uncle, today is Mr. Perfect's finals.

Pong, you can hug me now. I know now, I'm the one that forgot you. Looks like contestant #6, Pong Yu Yan has decided to forfeit the competition. What a shame. Wait! Let me take that back! Let us welcome Pong Yu Yan! Why are they playing this track? Did they make a mistake? It's not a mistake. He asked me to change it. Zhen Zhen is awesome! Mum is awesome too! The tap dance that I taught you, was what I planned to perform for the pageant I took part in. Did you win the pageant, Mum? Back then, I was pregnant with you, Zhen Zhen. So I chose to quit the pageant. Mum, don't be sad. When I grow up, I'll help you win that pageant. I don't want you to take part in pageants, I only want you to concentrate on studying. And be happy. Do you understand? Ladies and gentlemen, this is the exciting moment you have been waiting for! Who will be our champion tonight? Oh, please! Isn't it obvious? The champion is, of course, contestant #6, Pong Yu Yan! We won! Unfortunately, Pong was born mute, I will now give the thank you speech on his behalf. I want to thank my father, my mother, and... Pong, what are you doing? Yes, I may not be highly educated, I may be loud. Everyone calls me "Ah Lian". But so what? Can't an "Ah Lian" have dreams? The more you look down on me, the more I will prove to you that I can succeed! I know there are people who wish to see me fail. But I also know, there are people who wish for me to succeed. They will help meunconditionally, support me no matter what, I am very grateful to them. Because they have taught me, that to have dreams, is a real blessing. There are somewho lived half their lives withoutknowing what their dream is. A person without dreams is no different from a zombie. Don't you agree? Am I right? Am I right? Yes! Mum, I wanted to fulfil your unfulfilled dream, and then tell you... I love you. I Love you. I know. Mum knows now. Not only did I fulfil my dreams, I found my soul mate. Do you know you are the first man to say "I love you" to me? I love you too! Pong. Pong. Pong? Pong? Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong. Pong, don't die! Pong, I don't want you to die! Pong, get up! Get up, Pong! Don't die. Pong! Pong, get up! I beg of you! Please don't die! What's happening? Bai Bai. Zhen Zhen. Bai Bai. Pong. Pong!
