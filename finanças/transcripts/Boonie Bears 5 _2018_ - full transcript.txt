All right, salmon, here I come. Take a look, victor. Down the bend, upstream swim, find your way back home again! Down the bend, upstream swim, find your way back home again! Down the bend, upstream swim, find your way back home again. Dad, so the fish are gonna have babies. They're about to spawn. Spawn? Whoa! Whoa there. Stop, that tickles. Hey, look here, it's for you. A flashlight? Thank you, Dad. Hurray, now I can find my way even in the dark. When the world-famous River is filled with salmon that have swam miles upstream to spawn, the people in surrounding towns will line the shores by the hundreds to cheer them on, yelling "Welcome back!" These fish are believed to bring good luck to all who witness this wondrous sight. Locals believe that the hardships these fish go through to start a family, bless the families that attend the migrations. In other words... Experiment 99, begin. Experiment fail. What am I doing wrong? Hmmm, huh? Hmm? No! Maybe I should take a break. That's strange, I know I heard something. Briar? Bramble Hi. Huh? Now! Briar, you're crazy. I'm ending this right now. What are you talking about? There's no use playing dumb. You. I'm onto you buddy. We can't let you finish building this logging machine. Everyone stop! Do you think that was too hard? Oh, he'll be fine. Wait, it's not for logging, it's Tesla's gigantoray. Gi-wha? Did he say Tresle? Wrong, it's pronounced Tesla. Nikola Tesla. Sounds important. Oh very. He invented the alternating current system when he was only 30. Then he invented the Tesla coil, remote x-ray technology, torpedoes. But he didn't stop there. His greatest invention was the gigantoray. Wha? Here, the schematic. Just think about it friend, with this machine, a bun turns into a loaf, one egg could make a whole omelet. There's more, a stick becomes a tree. Ah, I'll take it. Oh! So now do you believe me? I didn't get it for logging. We believe you. What a waste of time. Hello, mom? Oh yeah, I got the pants you sent me all right. I'm wearing 'em now. You gotta stop worrying about me. You got enough to handle with dad. Say what? Dad's coming here? Um, hi. So uh, how was the ride? Vicktor, it's been too long. How are ya son? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I brought you a few knick knacks from back home. Boiled eggs, they're from my own roost, you know? They're really big this year. What else we got? Oh hair growth stuff, and some cold medicine from your mother. Dad, this is for kids. Is it? Well you know your mother, you're her boy, shampoo, corn, gloves, mushrooms, straw, paper, hair, brush, apples, thermos, more corn and a jacket. And this is Mikey.

Vicktor, oh I was just trying to help out and clean your lab a little bit. It was dirty and then there was the chicken and then there was the door and no, no, no, no, oh, hey, I brought you something here. Do you remember this old thing? Can you believe it? I got it all fixed up for you. What the? Ah, there we go, yeah. You see, just like old times? Why would I want that? I'm sorry, I just though that...- - Stop it! What did I like as a kid? Do you even know? No, no, don't answer, it doesn't matter. Look, you just show up out of the blue and what, you start kicking balls and making stews and everything's okay? Well, you get what you want but what about what I want, me? My dreams, my passions, you know nothing about me, do you? I, I, you haven't changed. And you never will. Will you please just go away? What did I sit on? Catch anything? No. We've been here for days and still no fish. That's strange. There should be tons of salmon migrating this time of year. What if we don't get any fish? I guess I could become a vegetarian. But fish is just too tasty. And pleased to have with us the translator and poet Ronald Atkinson. Ronald, what do you have for us today? This is a poem written by Du Mu, a poet from the Tang Dynasty. "Winding up the rocky mountain path, "in cold mountain path, homesteads are there "in the floating white clouds." Hi sweetie. I'm at the Pine Tree Mountain now. There's something going on with the salmon's migration path. The river must be blocked. I've got a few leads, could be illegal waste dumping. I'm checking it out. Who is that? She's so skinny. She looks like a needle. Have you thought maybe you were just too big? What, that's just more to love? Huh, Vick's logging! Briar and Bramble, you have no idea what's up. There you are. Um Hey you little punk, who do you think you are? Here, let me help you get out of here. Step away from the trees, Vick. Yeah, or else you'll have to deal with us. You two have been a thorn in my side for years but that stops right now. It's time to cut you two down to size. Now behold the shrink ray of doom. Say cheese. I'm sure you're wondering how I got such a dangerous weapon within my grasp. Well, with my super strong observation skills, I realized the magnifier got shrunk. It turned out that the machine Femore Odd sold me was not a magnifier. Instead, it was a shrinking machine. I'm gonna sort him out later. He didn't even know what he was selling. Just as I was about to throw it away, I noticed the flashlight on the ground and all of a sudden an idea just came to my mind. With my brilliant talent for making things and my one-of-a-kind creativity, I combined the two devices into one, and so the enhanced, super powerful, undefeatable all-time best shrinking machine was created. Briar, I think Vick's lost his mind. Briar and Gamble, the game is over. Ah, oh what's he gonna do? Get small. Huh? Is that it? Oh, oh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, stay right there, please. Give it a second, it'll work. What the? It needs a shake. Oh come on... Let's go. It's got new batteries. Hang on, wait a sec. Don't let him get away. Vick, stop! Nowhere to run Vick! Try to shrink me, will ya? Well I could shrink a little. Oh no, the flashlight. That's what you get for trying to cut down our trees. Where do you think you're going? You don't understand, let me go please. We're all gonna shrink. You don't know - what you're doing. - You hear that Bramble? He's gonna shrink us. Now let me go. Wait you don't know what you're doing. Come on, we're all gonna shrink. We have to run, now. Time for lunch, Vicktor. Where is he? Vicktor, Vicktor? Briar, Briar? Where are we? Earthquake, earthquake. Ah, look at that. You're a little cutie, aren't ya? Strange. You're like a giant squishy gummy bear. I could just eat you up. Where'd you come from? Hey Briar, come check it out. What is that thing? Vick, wake up. King Tiki, King Tiki, King Tiki, you'll never guess what I found. See, it's a little birdie. What is wrong with you? Focus! This is it, we must hurry. Come on, Vick, wake up. You, start talking now. What happened to us? Ah, we got shrunk. We're gonna get stepped on. We're gonna get devoured. Did he say shrunk? Hey, I told you to let me go. This is on you. Wait, what's going on? Oh Vick, you had us going there. Yep, the truth is this is all some kind of trick, right? What? Fess up, this is just some high tech tricky thing to make us feel crazy. Ah, so scared, run away. Then when we're gone, that's when you'll come in and cut down our trees. I'm onto you. You can't trick Okay well, that's a good trick. Hey, we're not gonna lose him, Bramble, stop running. You can win, I believe you. No time for that. How do we change back? You two distract it. I'll find the flashlight. Deal. Bramble, follow me. Yoohoo, big greenie, over here. Come on greenie. Catch us if you can. I found it. Bramble, get up. I know where it is. Quick, right there. Watch out! Come on, grab my hand. Light of the sun shine on my crown making it strong. What's happening? King Tiki, I don't think it worked. My ritual is perfect, it cannot fail. How is this possible? I didn't do anything wrongly. You, it must've been that bird of yours. oh yes. It's a trap. Vicktor! Vicktor! Huh? Vicktor, where are you? Dad, I'm over here, I'm over here. Dad, dad! Come on! - Vicktor! - Dad, I'm here, I'm right here. Don't go. I'm here, I'm here. Mr. Dad, come back. Dad guy! Vicktor! Vicktor! Please come back. Dad! It's over. Briar, this is still a trick right? Great job, Vick, you just couldn't mind your own business, could ya? You just had to cut down our trees. And now you made us miss lunch and dinner and dessert. We're so tiny and we can't even fight a frog. When is he gonna stop that? Come on! Don't mind him, he's just hungry. He'll be fine when he gets some food in him. Hey Vick, you and your dad, you two okay? He meddles in my life. It's complicated, okay, Briar? He's always pushing me and setting me up on dates, like I even need the help. He's just trying to live my life for me. No matter what, I've never been good enough for him. I just want to be my own man. I even put a note on the door. What's all this? Just leave me here. I can't go on. This was cut with something razor sharp. We'd better stick together. Bramble? I smell candy. It's chocolate! (ominous music( Bramble, Bramble! Bramble, behind me. Well hello there. You boys must be lost. Don't get many uninvited guests here who survive. Tonight's your lucky night. I'm afraid my dance cards are all filled up. This is where you run. Go, we're fine. Vick, let's go. Here, let me help you get out of here. Wait, I know you. It wasn't me. Stay back. What the Oh, it's you all right, ugly little bald man. Now that I've got you here just the two of us let me ask you a question, who's the punk now? Bramble, Bramble. What happened? That egg's fighting the bug. We have known one another for quite awhile, Long Claw. Pay me the respect of not holding back. With glee. Then let us continue. After you. Your old tricks won't work this time. You haven't seen the last of me. Hello everyone, forgive the unpleasantness. Well met, my friends, I am the legendary grass knight, Shadow Shell. Hello Vick, Bear brothers, it is my great honor to finally meet you. How do you know us? Your names echo through this forest far and wide but I am curious how you've come to be like this. A shrinking machine? I have never seen this before. Then truly you are in a pickle. Uh huh, that's right. Can you take us home? The sooner we get back the better. Let's see. Yes, I think I can help you. Really? Woohoo, we're saved, we're saved. Briar, we can finally go home. Huh? Before this journey, I do want to replenish my strength with a bit of chocolate. That was good. Farewell. Wait, Shadow Shell, I've got chocolate at my house. I'll give it all to you. Shadow Shell! As a knight of the grass, I must help those in need. Thank you. So tell us, Shadow Shell, where did you learn to use kung fu like that? It's so cool. You flew in like a lightning strike and saved the day. That mantis never stood a chance. You were incredible. I just did what anyone would do. Of course, I do have a weakness. Weakness, what weakness? To be honest, every time I see a full moon, you see, well, never mind. Full moon, like that? Shelly, you can come out now, okay? Shelly, this isn't funny anymore. - Wake up! - Hey shell guy, wake up! Wake up! You happy? This is your fault, Bramble. Well I suppose you've seen my weakness now, the full moon, my apologies. Shadow Shell, what kind of bird are you? And how come you're still in your egg? Oh I'm no bird. In fact, I am a grasshopper. This hummingbird's egg shell acts as my armor. That's the coolest thing I've ever heard. Guys look, we made it. Dad! Dad, where are ya? Strange, where could he be? Hey Vick, we found a note. A note... "I was hoping we could talk "before I went home. "But you didn't come back last night. "I don't blame you. "You were right. "I should've respected your space "but more importantly, I should've respected you as a man. "I prepared dinner for you, your favorite. "It's in the fridge. "I left you a night cap, "your mom made it for you. "Try and remember to get plenty of rest. "The ladies don't like bags under your eyes. "I'm kidding, well sort of. "Vick, it's been years since you've been home. "Your mother and I miss you so much. "We will always be there when you need us. "Until then, goodbye. "Love "Dad." Are you all right? I pushed my dad away. What about that there? You're standing on a sentence. Huh? He took it back? Excuse me, you look a little down. Everything will work out. One of my favorite Confucian quotes says, "In the end all things will bend." I'm sorry. It's fine, it's fine. Actually, the quote is all things will mend and it's not Confucius. Oh, I'm still learning. Yeah, me too. Are you here visiting family? Uh uh, hi, my name is Beth. I'm a marine biology major. I'm studying what's going on with the salmon. There's only one train a day to Stillwater and it's at 10 past five. And it's already one. We need to go. There's still time. It's impossible. Look at us, Briar, we can't possibly make it there on time. You're giving up? It's not fair, we're gonna be stuck tiny forever. How am I gonna get honey from the hive with these tiny paws? Haha, worry not, my friends. Where there's chocolate, nothing is impossible for Shadow Shell. The train station! Yay, we made it! I'll be big and beautiful again in no time. Shadow Shell, you saved us. I don't know what we would've done without ya. Don't mention it. About that chocolate... Of course, I'll make you a chocolate mountain. Ah, you honor me. You're not gonna fall asleep on us again like yesterday, are you? Bramble, zip it. It's fine, it's fine. Besides it's the middle of the, What do we do now? I don't know, can you fly a pigeon? Me? I guess it's just like riding a horse, right? Ripe watermelon here, ripe watermelon. I'll take watermelon. This is annoying. Hey guys... Huh? Ah, don't eat me, don't eat me! Whoa, sorry, you lost. Want to play again? Know what? I'm gonna have the roast pigeon, biggest one you got. Right, my right. Well, that could've been worse. Hey. Open up. Ah! Tap, you fool, tap faster. You know I have bad thumbs woman. Oh my goodness. Anyone lose a baby? Come on, come on, high score yes! Where's the baby? - Help, help! - Can anyone hear us? Help! Briar, what is this stuff? It feels like weird sticky spaghetti. We're stuck. This is it, there's no way we're gonna catch that train now. Hairy spider coming this way! Whoa! So cool. Boy, we're glad to see you. Hey. Money. Huh, what money? That's right. If you don't have any on you, you can scan our QR code for convenience. Who are you? Me? You mean you have never heard of us? Uh uh. Oy. Boss, they look new. Bunch of green horns. Let's show 'em. Gumpy, Gumpy. Gumpy, you are right. I am Pierre. Gumpy, Gumpy, Gumpy. Call me Eugene. I'm the brains. The name's Bubba. I'm strong. We rob from the rich and give to the poor. We are the Spicy boys. Now now, boss, do remember your blood pressure. Gumpy, Gumpy, Gumpy, Gumpy. We're great thieves. What you mean Gumpy? Gumpy, Gumpy, Gumpy, Gumpy, Gumpy. Quiet! Show some respect. That took a long time. So you want to get spicy? Uh boss, this don't look good. We have no choice. What's over there? Bramble, quick, they're catching up. Got it. We're caught. That was amazing. You saved us again. Oh yeah, saved by the shell. Not this again. Warrior, we are not worthy. Master, before we were thieves, we ran a very successful massage parlor right on the river. This style is called Serenities. Wow, that sounds nice. I'd like to try Serenties Gumpy claw. In your dreams. It is reserved for only the skilled warrior. Okay. My apprentice, he too is a warrior. Ah, right there. - Oh, that tickles. - Is this better, Warrior Bramble? Hey Vick. Huh? What's wrong? Worried about the shrink ray? I suppose so. Or are you worried about the way you left things with your father? How do you know that? Him. I mean all his dad did was cook for him every day and play his favorite games. And what did he do? He just yelled at him. Can you imagine? They're not very close at all. Bramble is right. It used to be different, we were inseparable. He got promoted at work and was busy. After that, we just started talking less and less. I remember the good times but mostly the bad. Do you need a hug? No, I'm okay. We never knew your childhood was so lonely. Gentlemen, I give you Pipesburg. Huh, whoa. Whoa! Everything flows to and from Pipesburg. This is how we get you home. It's beautiful. Yeah, how exactly do we get out of here? Well, that's the thing, we had a machine that could fly us anywhere we wanted. It worked like magic. We called it Dr. Wan. You mean a drone? Great. Where is it? The maggots stole it from us and now their boss has it. He's taken everything from us. That's terrible. Who's their boss? He is a golden haired buzzard, goes by the name Tricky Boo. Uh, how do we get your drone back? Well, since you asked, we fight. They're catching up. You'll be sorry you crossed old Tricky. After him! Find the controller. One, two, one, two. Oh no, watch out. Reef! The train bound for Stillwater is boarding now. Passengers please board the train in an orderly fashion. The train bound for Stillwater is boarding now. Passengers please board the train in an orderly fashion. All right. There's the exit, we made it. Come to Tricky. Mike! It's hero time! Gumpy! Gumpy! This isn't over! I can see the train. Full speed ahead, Eugene. Righto! Was that a monkey? Tiki. It's a trap! The train bound for Stillwater is leaving the station. All aboard for Stillwater. Not yet, wait! Vicktor, no! We were too late. Now we'll never turn back to normal. Don't worry, we'll think of something else. Huh, that looks like my dad's chicken, Mikey. That's the last time, Mikey, the last time. - Sir, sir, please don't run. - Get back in the bag! There's no running on the platform. Sir, come back, please. I need my famous stew, Mikey and there's nothing you can do about it. Famous stew? It's dad. Thank goodness dad's not on the train. We can change back now. Over there. Let's see you run away now. You're just chicken stew. Mikey, I'm gonna get mushrooms. Faster, faster, come on. Sire, I found him, the thief who stole the light. Follow him. Danny, what are we gonna do? It seems like she's knows our secret. Dot worry, by the time she wakes up, we're gonna be long gone. Hey right. Woo. The flashlight, Booboo, charge! Wee! What the, is that a monkey? Sire, wake up. What, where is the drugs? Run BooBoosh. Where did those monkeys come from? It's the flashlight. What's it doing here? - No! - Wait! - Dad, dad. - It's dad. Dad, you okay? Vicktor, what are you doing here? There's no time to explain. We have to go. Ugh, I just cleaned this floor. Run! Vicktor, why is that girl so big? No, my notebook. Dad, what are you doing? Look out! Vick, no. Hey dad guy! No use, they're too fast. We need a plan. Hey Briar, isn't that the noodle girl we saw. Hey Danny, I'm headed to the site, try and keep up. Hey garbage truck, I got one more. Bramble, over here. Dad, dad, are you hurt? Let me see. Dad, what's so important about that notebook? Don't you realize the danger we're in, huh? So dad, you're not on the train. I, I, I still have something to do. Vicktor, what was that? Look out, son. The flashlight, it's gotta be nearby. What, what flashlight? There's no time to explain. I found it. Dad, come on. Okay. Dad, stand in front of the flashlight. All right. Won't move. Vicktor! Dad. Dad, dad, dad! Dad, dad! Dad, daddy, dad! What? Dad! It's impossible. It's impossible. It's impossible. It can't be, no, it's impossible, it's impossible. Dad promised to fix the kite for me but he went to the forest again. Whatever. I don't believe him anymore. I don't want to hang out with dad anymore. I don't want a dad like this anymore. Come on, Vick, let's go fly the kite. I made you a swing. Hey Vicktor, let's go play ball. Do you want to go the amusement park? Vicktor, get up. It's time for bed. Why would I want that? What did I like as a kid? My dreams, my passions, you know nothing about me. Will you please just go away? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dad. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said those things. I shouldn't have let you go. Please come back to me. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm a bad son. Forgive me. Vicktor, Vicktor, Vicktor, Vicktor, Vicktor, Vicktor! I want to fly a kite and play football. What have I done? Please come and make me a stew. Vicktor, Vicktor! Please get off of me. I couldn't breath anymore. Dad! My son, I am so sorry. I didn't have time for you when you were young. Excuse me, excuse me. The train is about to leave. Hey sir! I may have missed out on your childhood but I'm not gonna make that mistake again. So that's what happened, eh? No wonder that girl was so huge. What shall we do next, huh? I need to find the flashlight. Let's hope Lady Luck's on our side. Yeah, but it'll be like finding a needle in a haystack son. Vicktor, what's that river down there? Well, there's only one river near Pine Tree Mountain. Oh no, it's time for the salmon to start migrating. Hey, where you going? Hey, what's the matter dad? Look. Salmon... And all that garbage is blocking their way. Who could do such a thing? You still ain't fixed it? Get up, let me try. You're taking too long. The stink, I can't handle it. It's too much for me. Huh? You better learn. We're making a fortune off this. But why the river, Danny? Where else we gonna dump, in your bedroom? They're dumping illegally in the water. Come on, let's just dump this garbage and leave. All right, all right. Come on, son, we've got to stop them. Dad, hold on, don't you think we're a little bit small? How could we stop them? Listen, the salmon need to overcome many difficulties during their migration each year. They spare no effort to swim upstream. They come back here once a year when autumn comes and the leaves turn red. I know but... But nothing. We cannot succeed if we don't try, Vicktor and we have to try our best now. You're right dad, but we're gonna have to hurry. I've left my phone in the truck. Good thing, I've got them now. That selfie's not bad. I'm so pretty I could kiss myself. Oh man, a pretty girl left a comment on my picture. I better take another. Dino, what are you doing up there? Oh, sorry, sorry. What? I swear I didn't touch nothing. Huh? What is wrong with this stupid truck? What the heck's that? Whoa. Finally, that's out of the way. Danny, Danny man, there's someone there. What? I'll look over here, you check that way. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I did it. Huh, hey where's the key? Where'd it go? Oh, it must've fallen out. Huh? What's that? Chicken? The key! Welcome aboard my mighty stead. Catch it! Oh, I got it. Uh oh. Why is this crazy chicken chasing us? How should I know? Dino, give me the key. Catch. It's Briar and Bramble. Oh, what have we here. Hey, hand over that key lady. Yeah, give it back. You want it, go fetch. Dang it. Say cheese. Nice. I've got to run but the police will be here soon. Bye. You're posing. Go get the key, I'll handle the girl. How am I supposed to find it? Oh thank goodness, Vick, you're okay. Whoa. And dad guy, you're okay too. Okay, we've got to hurry. It's almost sunrise. I can't see anything in this darkness. The flashlight, it's right over there. We found it. All right, yeah! Shadow Shell, go. Right. Get outta here, ah! Crazy. King Tiki, that lights so big. And bright. Stop right there. Open up. Hey, hey. Don't you dare. - Open up, open this door. - Hello, 911? 911, I've got a serious no signal, what? Come on. Get over here. Camera, Dino, the girl called the police, we gotta go. What is it with these animals? First crazy chickens and now monkeys? Incoming, run! Lucky us. Dino, get in, come on. Uh uh. Give me back my camera. Hands off. We got it. Huh? I can't let it get in the water. Hang on. It's mine. We're normal again. My big hands, my big booty, it's all big. Briar, we're huge again, bro. Woohoo, promise me we'll never be tiny again.
