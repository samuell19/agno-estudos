The Death-Throes of the Eagles The canteen girl has got two boobs The canteen girl has got two boobs that are pretty, firm and round that are pretty, firm and round But oh there's something wrong Terribly wrong! They're each a different size! May 5, 1821 - Death on St Helena Napoleon I Supreme ruler of Europe for 15 years The year 1822 was marked by unrest. Pressure emerges from a mass of agitators They are the men of the Old Guard, retired troops on half-pay... ...still faithful to the memory of Napoleon. This film shows a fragment of the history of this period. Captain Doguereau Goglu, Captain. - That's it, then? - All done, Captain. Let's go. Close the door... the captain hates draughts. And 2 coffees! Hell and damnation! Goglu... Listen to this. Paris is the centre of lofty ambitions. In the first rank of revolutionaries, there are the "Half-Pays"... ...former officers of the Imperial Army, to whom His Majesty pays... ....half their pay every quarter. They have the effrontery to complain and regret the age of the usurper! So the king pays us out of his pocket? And France, the country we served for 20 years... ...and who provides the money, is not who pays us?! Tell me, waiter... Can't someone make those people leave? Could someone? Maybe. Try for yourself. They're half-pays. His heavy yoke suited them better... ...than the Restoration with its amnesties and fairness. Good grief...! The amnesties! "The Restoration and its fairness..." That starts in a dungeon and ends in a square, to the sound of guns. The yellow press! Sir! That's "The Constitutional"! Give me a break! They make a mess of everything. Do you know what the "fairness" is that they talk about? Arrest, condemnation, execution! Who gets accused? Soldiers on half pay. Us! Always us! My God, we're right! Yes! Isn't that true? You can smell Europe from Gibraltar to Moscow... It's stunk of burning since 1814. The Imperial Guard lit the fire! Absolutely! We search among the veterans of the Guard... We pick through their drawers... ...and mess up their papers. Paris is rotting... You can only drown your shame in drink. And to finish the month... the bouquet. One of our number is shot at Tours. Brave Marshal Cirjean... by firing-squad! You will have read of his death... ...and how you leave, when you served under the Emperor. We order ourselves... "Charge! Take aim! "Fire!" And before falling... ...all traitors! May you burn in hell! If someone dislikes what I say... let him show me his face... ...and I swear I'll give the piece of shit a piece of... Doguereau! - Montander! - Are you crazy? Colonel! Goglu, our colonel's here! Our colonel in so many battles. - Just be quiet! - What am I risking? There are informers here... You'll end up in prison. That doesn't bother me. There are better things to do, you nincompoop! Sit down. Come see me at home around 5 o'clock... I'll give you my address. Haven't seen you for 3 years. More's the pity, Colonel. Shut the door, for God's sake! When I learned of his death, there on St Helena Island... ...at first, I didn't believe it. One of us had met the Emperor's valet... One of the faithful. He closed his eyes. I no longer doubted, I realised that our life was over... Buggered! Was it 2 years we spent in his village? Yes. I was waiting for death. Instead, my health has returned! I walk pretty well, and my frame is sound! But... I've nothing inside me anymore. It died… With him! Died on that rock... ...guarded by soldiers in red jackets. Him... "The little Corporal", "the Crew-cut", "The Violet" …. Our Father… The Emperor! With respect, Minister... Hello... Sit down. I've just come from the Privy Council. His Majesty was sharply critical of you, Prefect... ...and I regret to say that he was quite justified. No! Sit down. I'm not asking you for your resignation for now. His Majesty is worried about the riots that are breaking out everywhere. An exaggeration! 2,000 people demonstrating for an hour... ...shouting "Long live the Emperor..." ...and marching from Pont-Neuf... ...along the Grand Boulevards as far as Porte Saint-Antoine. The gendarmes broke them up. Under a hail of tiles and bricks that put 11 of them in hospital! There's last month's riot and the incessant unrest... ...occurring in Nantes, Toulouse, Lyons and Marseilles. You have failed to find the leaders of the conspiracy. Minister, there is no conspiracy! These little affrays betray an unfortunate general state of mind. But they are spontaneous movements... ...with neither leader nor organization. - And the Half-Pays? - They aren't dangerous. They don't hide missing the Empire... ...nor being Bonapartists, but Bonaparte is dead. Bonaparte is dead, but his son is alive. Alive, but very small. What can a child, that Mr de Metherny is watching, do? He can win the hearts of a nation... ...because he is a child of Napoleon, the usurper. The revolution ignores the feeling. Historians and poets don't agree with you. Minister, I am a policeman. These manifestations would worry me if there was a plan and a leader. There is a plan, there is a conspiracy, there is a leader. My best men are looking for... His Majesty doesn't want men who look... ...he wants men who find. A young officer of the royal army... ...a secret agent of the king... ...has very important information in his possession. You'll meet him tonight at the Countess Aurmesson's ball. This young lieutenant's name is Mr de Breuilly. See him, and give me your report. Very well, Minister. You're furious, Prefect. No, not furious. More like humiliated. I don't believe in the importance of Mr de Breuilly's discoveries... ...but I'm annoyed that without informing the prefect of police... ...His majesty has created a body of secret agents... ...Who are discovering what you seek in vain. Goodbye, Prefect. What could he want to tell me? It must be important. Eyes front! Captain Doguereau, of the 1st Grenadier Guards. Goglu, Grenadier Guard, his batman for 20 years. Lieutenant Triaire, Light Infantry. Commander Foure, Cavalry. Captain Chouard, Armoured Cavalry… It's been such a long time! Commander Thierry, of the Lancers. Come closer, Captain, I'm blind. Lieutenant Huguenin… Huguenin! You old pig-headed bastard! Captain! - You know him? - I know them all. This bastard carried me on his back when I was injured at Montereau! - Captain! - Beautiful bastard! Come on, sit down. Disillusioned, he wanted to die. Don't say anything and listen. Sit down, Goglu. Excellent report from Couturier on the 32nd regiment in Nantes… 107 soldiers, one captain, 3 lieutenants and 11 sergeants. I even have a noble, Lieutenant de Breuilly. I am suspicious of his origins, I didn't tell him everything. He's enthusiastic. As well... listen to this... 150 indifferent men who will not attack the regime... but won't defend it. As soon as I get the order, I march on the prefecture. From our perspective, seems fine. A letter from Santini, in Bordeaux, brought by the young Triaire. I already have 60 fellows too fat to be useful... - Etc, etc. - But what… No interruptions! Chambure, from Belfort, has great news, but at the end of the letter... ...he adds this... I'm arranging a small riot... ...to give the king's prosecutor a spanking. Bravo! No, this is how I answered. Save your spanking for later. Let's prepare everything calmly ...to burst like thunder when the boy is ready. The boy? His son. Napoleon II. So that's what's being prepared here? Are we going to put him back on the throne? Yes! Where else? But... Can it succeed? You believe it can succeed? It's impossible for us to fail. Why are you going to this ball? I have an important meeting. With whom? - Official business. - You're not nice. You've been in Nantes for 3 months... I've waited for you feverishly... ...and as soon as you arrive, you're off to a ball. Darling, listen... - I thought you were playing tonight. - No. I got replaced. Come with me. I'll come with you... ...but I won't be with you. We'll pretend to barely know each other... We'll greet each other formally. I'll be suffering, too. This is important for my chance of promotion. If my colonel knew that I adored an actress... ...he'd forbid me from seeing you. Go ahead, you can dance while you're waiting for me. - You'll allow me? - Why not? - Aren't you jealous? - I trust you. You're right. I love you! His excellency, Baron Dukohine! The Hon. Lieutenant de Breuilly! Colonel... ..the prefect of police is here. Watch him. I have to join this gentleman. It's the prefect of police. Darling, why? - You're not involved in something serious? - No. The Marquis de Montander! Dear little star, here is the Marquis! We had to continue with the pretense... It would have revealed the secrets to us. No. I've been part of the conspiracy for 4 months... I've raised money and recruits. I only know that their leader... ...is in Paris and is waiting the signal to revolt. Knowing no more, I made my report. I assumed that in prison, the police could make him talk. - So? - He's said nothing. Your report remained secret? - Yes. - And...? He was shot. That's insane! When we're onto something, we don't let go. Provincial police! Why me? There are lots of actresses. But none has your charm or your talent. - I love the old comedies. - Are you that old? No. But since 1815, the theatre has been my favourite distraction. I knew Jenny Vertpre who sang "The Thieving Magpie" so well. - I knew Malibran in… - Great singers. Great artists... ...but none have moved me like you have. You're very gallant, Mr Montander. No, not gallant. I spent my life on the battlefields, not learning to talk to women. I mean what I say. It seems to me that your voice has a miraculous timbre... ...a sound that reaches to the bottom of a man's heart. That's nearing a declaration of love. It wouldn't be your first. Nor yours. You probably speak of love to all women. - There are worse subjects. - Yes. No I don't go courting all women. No flowers, sweets, or stupid phrases... ...to get something which isn't worth wasting time for. The gallantry is over! Not for those who give themselves in exchange for flowers or words. Love is a higher thing, more beautiful, more brutal... ...and in which confectioners and florists have no role. This love without a confectioner... Have you found it yet? Not yet, I admit. I want you to meet him. No, my dear! That little Corsican was the pledge of his employers. He seized the throne of France with Austrian and English money... Then he revolted. According to him, it happened. Excuse me for a moment, madame. Sir, may I have a word with you in private? Yes… if you wish. We can leave in 5 minutes, I'll join you at home. Who did you dance with? The Marquis de Montander... ...a charming man, but impolite, he left me for a friend. We can stay... You can see him again. Finally the first hint of jealousy! You're a love! I'm leaving. Come quickly. I'll be longing for you. You've spoken of the Emperor in intolerable terms. Are you serious?! I didn't insult you. It's me who's insulting you. Good. My witnesses will be at your address, tomorrow at 8am. - Colonel de Montander. - Viscount de Vezelay. One of the best blades in Paris! Don't brag or I'll apologize. The canteen girl has got two boobs The canteen girl has got two boobs that are pretty, firm and round that are pretty, firm and round But oh there's something wrong Terribly wrong! They're each a different size! Who is it? Come in! Commander! Hello, Commander! Hello, Doguereau. Have a seat. May I speak? Of course, old chap. You know Louis... ...footman at Madame d'Aurmesson's. Last night, a grand ball at her place. Go ahead, Louis, report! The prefect of police was there. The colonel told me to watch him... ...and I see him catch the attention of an elegant young man... A lieutenant de Breuilly. I know that name… In the letter from lieutenant Couturier. He was suspicious of him. - He had good reason. - Why? Mr De Breuilly followed the prefect of police... ...into a small lounge room. They were there for 20 minutes behind closed doors. Did you hear anything? I tried from another room, but the walls were too thick. It certainly doesn't smell good. This informer has given Couturier away. - Did you warn Montander? - No. My boss took him home. This morning he was already gone with Triaire, Huguenin, and 2 swordsmen. The commander brought me here. Goglu, go over to Fortunat's… - Very good. Captain! - Wait, damn it! Have him go to Nantes to warn Couturier. If his horse can't make it, he can buy another one... I'll give you the money. Commander Thierry? That's me. I've just come from Nantes… Couturier... he's been shot... He was denounced by de Breuilly. Couturier, shot… Couturier… - Is he wounded? - No. He fell asleep. Farewell, Couturier. Farewell... ...old brother of mine. Who is he? I don't know. He has to be one of ours… Goglu… get some food and wine ready. Very good, Captain. Do you know where we can find De Breuilly? Yes. He has a meeting at 10am, at the Procope Cafe. In an hour and a quarter… He won't get to denounce anyone else. My hat. Thierry... We'll take care of the informer. You stay here with our friend. If he wakes up before our return... ...tell him to make himself at home. Look at those 4 men. Is he there? He's the one facing us. Stand back, he can recognise you. Hurry off and tell Montander to wait for me at his house. He's in the cavalry. A sword duel! I wouldn't want to be in his place. He's an informer... So how to we arrange provocation to result in a duel? Don't worry, I'll fix it. You should've killed him. 5 inches of steel in his shoulder... A month in hospital will teach him to speak politely about the Emperor. 6 years ago there were others you killed. He was good with the sword... but I wouldn't have done it like you. - And I would have been quicker. - How? After the second parry he attempted a lunge... You counter-attacked, but if you'd thrust all the way... ...you would've pierced his heart. - I know, but I would've killed him. - So what? - That's not the point of fighting? - Not anymore. Listen, boys... When we lived without hope, with rage in our hearts... ...it relieved us, to kill in a duel those who insulted our chief... ...or had caused his downfall. I've killed 11 in 5 years! But now we have a great task to accomplish. Let's not attract the attention of the police. What's the use of killing our political enemies... ...who could become soldiers of the Emperor! - No more quarrels? - That's right. So... how are we going to amuse ourselves?! Your opinion doesn't interest me. Well, I'll give it to you, anyway! Who is he? A stupid old fool who's past correction. You just insulted me! You're going to apologise, immediately! Understand? Keep your mouth shut. Otherwise he's waiting for you! You looking for trouble? We're looking to settle this with weapons. If it amuses you, we can make you number 2. So be it! Lieutenant de Breuilly. Captain Doguereau! We'll settle this matter this afternoon. Excellent! Goglu, pass me the newspaper. Go see if you can find our friends. Silly old fool. What are you doing tonight, Colonel? I'm going to the theatre. - Why? - It's the anniversary of Wagram. I arranged a celebration at a dive on Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple. There'll be Doguereau, Goglu, us 2, Thierry, Chouard and Foure. The dive belongs to Honore, Marshall Bertier's old chef. - What time? - 7 till 10. I'll make sure I'm there. This duel is nonsensical. Why, Colonel? Couturier's death proves that we're being sought. We have to realise that if a half-pay kills an informer of the prefect... ...the police are going to be watching us. This is the captain's 25th duel... The police are used to it. Perhaps. No meetings for a fortnight. I'll entrust my papers to Triaire. This duel is dragging on. He doesn't want to hurt him. He wants to kill him. Give me my shirt. Gentlemen, the blow was fatal. A young man was slain, like an ambushed animal! - There was no ambush. - Can people kill like that? Duels are ignored by the justice system... ...so long as they follow the code of honour, which was the case here. Here is the statement signed by de Mr De Breuilly's witnesses... ...who affirm that the duel followed the rules. Plus the signatures of the doctor and the opponent's witnesses... ...Lieutenant Huguenin and Colonel Montander. Montander? - The Marquis de Montander? - Yes, madam. You know him? Oh yes. Here are the documents. These are the most compromising. Take very good care of them. You can count on me. We need a way to avenge Mr de Breuilly completely. What should I do? I'll tell you everything. The duel was fair, but not the provocation. It was murder. Why was he killed? Because he interfered with a plot. A plot against the state, and his death reveals the seriousness of it. It was an organisation that killed him. Are you going to arrest them? No Madam... it would be clumsy. If it's just these 3 men, it's not serious... No need to stop them. If they're part of a vast organization... ...the arrest would only serve to prematurely warn the others. Understand? Now... Did Montander know of your connections with de Breuilly? No. Only an officer of the regiment knows. Perfect! If you agree, we'll have a common goal... We have to find all their leaders. We must prevent them from being suspicious... So I won't have them watched. - Why? - A policeman can be spotted. But a young woman can pass anywhere. Give me your full cooperation to serve your king... ...and avenge our poor friend, murdered by that scum. - Serve you as a spy? - No! Non… As a helper. They massacred him... The sabre went through his heart, it came out between his shoulders. How awful! Don't cry. With your help... ...all of them will find themselves lined up in front of a firing squad. My friends, we need to take a break... I see the shadow of a cork! Let's drink to our sweet Fanchon! Ah, how sweet her conversation! She has both merit and glory, She love to laugh, She loves to drink! She loves to sing like us! She love to laugh, She loves to drink! She loves to sing like us! She loves to laugh and drink! She loves to sing like us! Bravo A woman's handwriting... The Variety Theatre, a dressing room… Madam, it's the gentleman you sent for. Have him come in. Thank you for your charming gesture, and your kindness. Take a seat. You looked lost, all alone in this dressing room. I kept that honour to myself. Your roses are lovely. I thought you didn't like confectioners or florists. You're not so different after all. This evening, you sang better than ever. - Because you were there? - I wouldn't make that claim. Having of a friend in the audience gives one more confidence... ...a sort of inspiration. - It's very hot. - Particularly tonight. Besides, I sang in the matinee. I'd like to go to the countryside... I'm tired of grass made of paper and trees made of cardboard. You came. Did you think I wouldn't? Were you in doubt? I don't take happiness for granted. - I haven't acted properly. - In what way? I hardly know you. But I know you very well. You do? I've seen you cry. - Me? - Yes. On stage of course! I've seen you laughing, dancing, singing, sobbing... ...heard declarations of love, kill your mother... ...leave your husband, beg your lover. I know all your feelings... from violent to tender. - They're pretend, it's theatre. - I know... ...but this pretending reveals your true nature to me. I know you. This is all very embarrassing. Why? Admiration has never upset anyone. - Lise... - Don't come near me, I hate you! - Why? - For the crime I've committed. I beg you… What a brute you are. You're part of that band of murderers. Taking advantage of a woman's weakness Go away! I don't understand. It was you who wanted this, today. We were talking together almost tenderly. - I gave you a kiss. - Stole a kiss! And after that? - I don't know… - Lise, forgive me. I don't do this on a whim... I really do love you. I've known many women, but none moved me like you... You have become everything to me you give meaning to life. What happened is shocking, but I'm only a man. And you, Lise, so pure, so delicate, you couldn't resist. There was your accommodating nature and violins in the distance. Your feelings are stronger than you are. Why blame me for losing my head? Lise, forgive me. I beg you to forgive me. Let's go home. But, Lise… I love you. I love you, Lise. Where's the colonel? With a woman. - Nothing wrong with that. - He doesn't waste time, eh? - You know her? - No. It's never the same. - Women talk. - Not when they know nothing. What about the papers? I have them. If the police don't move, I'll give them back to him. He never takes women home to his place... He knows his responsibilities. Ah... women... Phooey! - See you, chaps. - Goodbye, Captain. Goglu... Recognise him? No. Look at his leggings, shoes and the way he buttons... I don't know. This guy is a soldier. And we don't walk that way anymore since the Farewells of Fontainebleau. But yes... Grandaye! Captain Grandaye... 46th Regiment at Tour-d'Auvergne, 1st rank... 1809. That's right. - And you? - "You"? Doguereau! You fucking dummy! Who else would I be? You old bugger! I never thought I'd see you again. Old chap! Grandaye the brave! And how! The drinker, the looter! Old brother! The one who carries letters to the Emperor. Grandaye, the one they used to shoot at! What's this with the walking-stick? A bullet received at Montereau. If I wobble a bit, I'm just flirting! I march just the same, loyal to my post! Eh, Goglu? Come, come... Good old Grandaye... what a surprise! It's as if I expected it. You'll see... ...we live on the 5th... ...in a place full of muskets, swords, officers' hats and pistols. There's a number of us who meet and talk... ...like Montander… Colonel Montander? - Major Coutillot… - I remember him. - Lieutenant Fortunat… - 3rd Squadron of Hussars. He lost 2 fingers. Heck! He knows everyone! I'm going to tell you... We don't have money, but we've seen tougher times, eh, Goglu? We dine or we don't. Your body... ...just a gut to feed? Your body's 150 pounds of meat... ...rotting most of the time! We don't have dinner every day... ...but we plot assassinations here. We're full to the brim with hope! There are times when it's... ...up to there! You'll have to be part of it! You're here, that's one more. That right, Goglu? Put an army together... strike a blow... ...and put the boy on the throne of the great one... That's our game-plan! Besides, Montander will initiate you... While you wait! I'm the only one talking... I'm not letting you put in a word. No one will ask you where you live. What are you doing with yourself? Since 1815? It's already 8 years. You look good in your smart clothes... The outfit of a stockholder! What have you done, since you left the army? I'm still in the army. In what way? Did you go back? You? I know what you're thinking... ...but all the same, listen before judging me. Listen... at Waterloo, I was young. 32 years old. At that age, we're too young to retire. Another government, a new life. The future! I was a captain of the Guard. The Empire was beaten... What could I do? I was in love with a girl from the nobility. I was named Lieutenant-Colonel of the Guards... ...and offered the title of baron promised by the Emperor. Understand me. I was alone, on half pay. These offers could have gone to my head. Yes... I know... You understand none of that. You're old-school... You have few needs. You're living a dream. I didn't have your loyalty. I didn't have that fortitude. But, like you, I loved the Guard and I loved the Emperor... ...who raised me from the ranks after the Battle of Kulm... ...as a reward. 2 years later, I abandoned the Eagles because it had to. It's what I needed. I mean… For an occupation which… ...I needed. For money. Everything is there. Have a schnapps. I'm going to see my girlfriend. - Cute? - Pretty much... ...but her sister's even cuter. You fall in love an awful lot. - Sure... always a new woman. - It's a good principle. It's just the way I am. Do you manage more than one at a time? - I ask them. - And if they refuse? They're more interested than us as to who's prettiest. Have you ever met a woman who remains unmoved... ...even after giving you everything? Such as? My current mistress always smiles, but she's not happy. She gives herself to me as if it's just for my pleasure. She sometimes has a look filled with hate. I'm quite mystified. She's a pain in the arse. No, my boy... She listens to me... she hardly ever speaks. Maybe she loves me and doesn't want to show it. She'd see me in the arms of another, without being jealous. Have you encountered this before? - Never! - You're no lover then. I'm passion personified! Have you ever had deep feelings for a girl you think of day and night? Someone you'd like to protect, who gives meaning to your life... ...who seems to sum up the universe? Have you ever experienced this love? Yes. For the Emperor. Yes, you're right... He's the only one who deserves it. Your opinions are very important to me... ...but carry no weight with the law. But I'm sure. I believe you. Montander is certainly leader of the conspiracy, But you have to find written evidence at his place. - He won't invite me there. - Just go there. I'd rather not. Have you forgotten Mr de Breuilly? I'm not going to Montander's place! Just go and search his home. We'd look stupid... We have to be sure. It's easy for you to find an excuse... ...to go to his home one evening. Take any papers that are there... ...and throw them out the window... ...to one of our agents disguised as a coachman. What reason would I have to go there uninvited? Write a letter to yourself... An anonymous letter. On the 3rd floor, the door on the left... The door on the left. You'll find a woman... ...in her bedroom. Signed "a lady friend". Put the address in my name. You? Yes, it's me. - Is it inconvenient? - Certainly not. But who told you…? Your address? Not you... but I found it all the same, since I'm here. Don't I get a kiss? Forgive me. I'm just surprised by this visit... ...and your tone. You're not playing tonight? - I have a night off. - Are you unwell? - No, I'm not unwell. You're not pleased to see me. I meant well by coming. But it's best I go. Goodbye! Lise, please... what's the matter? What have people been telling you? Why, Lise? Why? I understand you less and less... ...and maybe that's why I love you more and more. What is it? You're all that I have! Liar. - I swear! - Liar, don't swear. Anonymous, of course. You're so cold... How can it affect you? Not much. I saw what I wanted to see. There's a woman here, hence your refusal to invite me home. This sanctuary is reserved for others. I'm just good for the countryside! That's absurd but wonderful! It means you love me! No… Don't go, stay. Look I don't want to. Let me go! You're jealous... That's wonderful! You're jealous for no reason. You owe me this visit. Stay here. Come. Look! Look under the furniture. Look carefully. Well? Are they letters from her? No. It's work. Lists of former comrades, Doguereau, Foure, Triaire… She might come later. Certainly not. It doesn't smell of perfume... ...but soldier. It's possible. Are you reassured? She may come later. On my word of honour... I'm not expecting anyone. Then I'll stay. Alright? Thank you, Lise. If you don't go home... ...won't your maid call the police? Oh no. I told the coachman to wait 15 minutes, then go home, Did you know you were staying? No. If the letter hadn't lied... ...I would have been out of here immediately. And if you were alone, you'd get to keep me. Keep your eye on the window. If something falls out… I think it's the young lady who's fallen.... ....in my honest opinion... ...onto a bed! Must have been one of your girlfriends who wrote the letter. Nobody knows of our love. More likely one of your old ones! If she wanted to separate us, she's hardly succeeded. - You love me? - I love you. Not as much as I do. They're your first words of love. So is it over with you being nasty? Why have you been so hard on me? I thought I was just a distraction for you. You have so many things on your mind... ...while I... You have your acting. It doesn't interest me anymore. Lise, my sweet... Did you rape entire convents? Not me, but I saw it happen. - A mob of animals! - You're right. I'm staying here tonight. Here? I only have this little bed. I may be the 1st woman to sleep there. Go out, while I undress. Why? Familiarity breeds contempt. Alright. Are you cross with me for coming? I've never been cross with you. So why have you never invited me? This place isn't fancy enough for you. I'd say the opposite. It's wonderfully simple... and manly. Giddy up boy... go! What are you doing? What are you doing there? I told the coachman to leave. Go away... turn off the light. These letters are going to create a stir... France is in revolt. You signed this... You give the signal! I take this responsibility. As we all do. You didn't force us to follow you. Heck, no! Success will depend on the date that's chosen. As soon as possible... There are informers everywhere. These are vague suspicions. Let's avoid them becoming more specific. For the arrest I'll enter Montander's with all my men. And you, commander, will block the street with your battalion. - A battalion? How many are they? - 8 or 10. - That's not many. - What's your problem? They're all ready, but they've spotted us, I'm afraid. Well, naturally. Your men are incapable... ..of looking like simple chestnut-sellers. Anyone can tell they're police! If they suspect something, we have to hurry. The police! - For God's sake! - Maybe just a watch. Look at that. Know that old lady? She has a funny look. Just as we're reaching our goal! Let's not get carried away. What can they know about us? Treason! A company of Guards surrounds the building. Halt! What do we do? We burn everything. Above all, we must save our active soldiers... They risk the death penalty. Who's betrayed us? Someone in on the plot. 15 people know the leaders. It's Valeo! That's not possible. It can't be Valeo. I can't believe it's Valeo. There's the prefect. What are we going to do? - We're not going to prison. - Oh no. - We defend ourselves? - No. We'd be wiped out. - OK? - OK. - OK. I say... Wouldn't it be fun to shoot one of them? What for? On behalf of that old woman. I'm tempted. It's useless, Captain. It's just some poor bastard doing his job. Remove the table. Tell me when it's all burnt. Bring that. Who's there? Open in the name of the law! Open or we'll force our way in! Colonel, the papers are burned. We're only risking our lives. Open the door. - What do you want? - In the name of the law… What law? Come in... Alone. Wait for me there. Here are 8 officers, including 3 senior commanders... ...of the old Grand Army, all decorated by the Emperor... ...who gave honours lightly. Take off your hat, Sir. - Are you here to arrest us? - Sir, I... I know how to respect... I'm the first to acknowledge... ...soldiers worthy of glory. However, your greatest proof of wisdom will be to follow me. What a babbler! I'm fulfilling my mission, I'm following orders. If you refuse to obey, you'll be subjected to extreme violence. By awakening in the hearts of the people... ...hatred, and political hopes, that are doomed to failure... ...as it must be. I'm warning you, that if you don't surrender... ...the army will attack this building. The army? Yes. A battalion of regulars. Thank you for figuring that we're worth a battalion. You need to evacuate the tenants of the neighbouring blocks. It's done. You won't resist? Gentlemen, in the name of the law… What do the laws that despise us, do for us? We honour the master who's gone... ...despite your ingratitude and your threats. We only acknowledge his name and his authority... We love the Emperor. He looks at us and approves of us. Defeated, but not reduced... We won't surrender... except to the doctor of the dead. We won't have you linger. Sir, you have influence on your friends. Persuade them. Do you think you're talking to boys in a boarding-school? Let me warn you, we're going to explode. That's right, be blown up. It'll be quite a bang, eh chaps? We have barrels of gunpowder. The leniency of the court doesn't justify anything. No trial... we're not lawyers. We don't even want to defend ourselves. Don't insist. We're packed and ready for death. Good day to you, France... Set the lighter... ...and all of us are blown to smithereens... ...like a band of saints. Because these soldiers, Sir, are saints... The true saints of a good God! You'll see for yourself, when you cross to the other side of life. If aren't ready to die right away, go get some fresh air. - The lighter. - Yes Captain. Explosion in 10 minutes. Leave, Sir. Thank you, Sir. My pleasure! They're going to blow themselves up. They're blowing themselves up. No complaints? Who wants to face trial and degradation? You're all free to choose. Our death serves no purpose. Anyone who wants to live, leave the building. Fine. - You're ready? - Ready, Colonel. Someone at the door! Gerard! I don't want you to! - Lise, leave us! - If you die, I'll die too! That's all we need! A woman! What'll we do with her? She'll be blown up! Give me a minute. - You can't understand us. - I don't want you to die! Lise... please! Forgive me, Gerard! Forgive me. I didn't know... I didn't understand. Was it you, Lise? - Was it you? - Forgive me… But why? Why? Just a police spy… No, Gerard! I wanted to avenge my lover... Who? Pascal de Breuilly, who Doguereau killed. Not a spy... a woman in love. It was him you loved... and me you betrayed. It's you I love now, and I don't want you to die! I loved you, and you betrayed me. My stupidity will kill my best friends! - I'll obtain their pardon. - You know the police that well? Your lover had Couturier shot. That's not true. Doguereau killed him because he was an informer. You have to live, for my sake! If you die, I'll die with you! Hey, Colonel, The little lady was suffering... But now she's stopped thinking we're afraid. If you love the colonel, don't try to dishonour him. She's already done that. She's the one who betrayed us. - Her? - Forgive me. Forgive me. That's one weight off my mind... It wasn't one of us. Oh yes.... a woman... Of course! Now, get the hell out of here! No, I'll stay with you, whatever happens. Die with us? No kidding? You've no right to die for the Emperor. Go away! Gerard, no. Gerard… Captain, they're going to attack. They've brought up a cannon. The lady must go. Alright. My poor friend… You must bear your mistake. Take this woman and return her to her bosses. Do you want me to go? You deny me the honour of dying with you? And our oath? We can't kill her. She's worthless... ...but she's a woman. Your order, chaps… We give up. The hearing is open! The accused! Bring in the witness. Sergeant Moufard... ...affirms that Lieutenant Corbigny, of the 35th Infantry at Toulon... ...proposed to him that he join the conspiracy. The sergeant testified calmly and without hatred... He even admitted the lieutenant had treated him well. A valuable testimony. Montander... Is Lieutenant Corbigny one of your accomplices? I don't know Corbigny... But I've had the pleasure of meeting Sergeant Moufard... ...who has the very ugly face of a bastard. Do not insult the witness! Doguereau, do you know Lieutenant Corbigny? I don't know, but may I say... ...Sergeant Moufard offers a very small surface... ...to receive the number of kicks in the arse he deserves... ...and which he'll receive! You have accomplices, you admit it! Anything you want... but we have no accomplices. Who will punish the sergeant? The good Lord, who knows everything. I warn you, any more misbehaviour and I'll clear the court. Thierry. Confess, Thierry. Thierry, you'll respond! I'm Commander Thierry... I haven't been downgraded. Commander Thierry, did you hear the question? Yes, questions are all I'm hearing. What's your answer? Old chap... Nobody asks you anything... But you're throwing questions around all the time. So just calm down, calm down. We're judging conspirators, who I could call parricides... Old soldiers or rather old slaves of the tyrant "Buona-parta"! Napoleon! By the grace of God and Constitutions... Emperor of the French, King of Italy... Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine! Respect please for the leader! - Miss Lise Dorian. - I've no time. - You're not going to shoot them? - Oh yes. - Why? - They admit to the charges,... - Even the false ones. - The false ones? As a precaution. Now, I don't have time. - Don't kill Montander. - He'll be the first. I don't want it! I don't want it! Women take all the fun out of policing! General Baron Grandaye de la Braudeliere. Why is HE here? General... The Council of War, at your request, decided to hear from you. You have the floor. On the conspiracy... I've nothing to say... ...except that I doubt if it really exists. I came to tell you about these men. For 15 years, at their side, I marched across Europe. I know them. There's an absurd word in the charge. An intolerable word. The word is "treason". In 1815, these officers refused to stay in the army... ...and take an oath to the new flag... But they did not betray the regime. And to accuse them of crimes against their country is just a lie. Politics and country are two different things. No crimes in politics... only mistakes. The mistake they made... ...was that they didn't put themselves on the stronger side. Is that what you're punishing? Take care. By hitting them... ...you're striking man's highest virtues of loyalty, generosity, courage... ..and the most difficult of all... ...staying loyal in adversity. It's not them that I'm defending... It's the honour of our country. Beware that on these breasts... ...the bullets do not risk puncturing old wounds. It is beyond reason that a French platoon... ...should have as its target these veterans of Waterloo! The bugger will make the president cry. Yes, it'll get worse. General, the Council thanks you. Grandaye! You can put it back. Why did I put 250 police in the audience? To stop any demonstrations. And you were applauding more strongly than anyone else. Why? I didn't do it on purpose. - Are you a Bonapartist? - No no no. But I'm afraid it's starting. - I don’t want to go back there. - You're on foot-patrol for 2 weeks. Get out. There it is. The man's an idiot. It aggravates my anxiety... There are an awful lot of idiots. In three days of the trial, we've already had 10 small riots. It's up to you to enforce order. - What if blood flows? - So blood flows. Around the Sorbonne and the Temple, 3 large groups were shouting... "Down with the Charter and long live..." What? "Long live The Emperor!" I'll assign you two regiments. - It won't be too much. - Really? Yes, Minister. This trial is having an unexpected impact. We had to let them cry over their medals and portraits Bonaparte is dead... we risked nothing. Now these men are put on a pedestal. Traitors to their country! Heroes, in the eyes of the people! - Why? - I don't know. They don't know themselves. The truth is, everything regarding that man... ...any reminders of his madness or his victories... ...a song, a word, a gesture, that set Europe on fire. England delivered us from his life. Who'll deliver us from his death? So what's to be done? Don't condemn them to death, otherwise we risk a revolution. 10 or 15 years confinement is quite enough. And if they escape? What if they commit suicide? After the prosecution witnesses heard yesterday... ...the defense witnesses. There aren't any. Accused, you do not have the floor. The defense has only one witness. Elise Viviane Fortunee Clement... ...better known in the theater under the name of Lise Dorian. Have the witness come in. - Who did this? - Me. I have to save you. What a witness! Madam, would you like to be seated? It's not necessary. Don't be afraid to tell what you know about the case. Last October, 8 months ago... ...I met Lieutenant de Breuilly, of the Royal Army. What's this got to do with the case? If you want to intimidate the witness and obstruct justice, say so now! We only have one witness... At least listen to her. We listen with total impartiality. Continue, madam. I was in love with Mr de Breuilly... I became his mistress. On May 18, he was killed in a duel, by Captain Doguereau. - From the Imperial Guard! - Silence! I swore to avenge him... ...but I didn't know that he'd caused a friend of the captain's to be shot... ...and that he was a secret agent of the police. The witness cannot question the actions of someone dead. She's revealed a state secret, if it were true. I demand the hearing be in camera. The witness must be more discreet in such delicate matters. I resolved to save my lover. I approached Mr de Montander. I watched him for a while. And I personally furnished the prefect of police... ...with proof of the conspiracy. Guards, expel the demonstrators... ...Those who are standing at the back of the court! Continue, Madam. The witness's statement has brought unexpected backing for the prosecution. The witness affirms the existence of the conspiracy. Yes, the conspiracy existed! But what conspiracy? I've known these men or at least their leader. I've penetrated their poor secret. It was not a secret of ambition or of hatred. It was a secret of love. You don't have the right to have these men killed... ...for wanting to deliver a child! Just a plea! I've a right to plead... I'm pleading for myself. There's only one betrayal... mine! They are facing their judges. I am facing mine. Don't forget it in your verdict. It's I alone who will bear all the weight. The pity they won't ask for, I beg of you... ...not for them, but for me. The council will accomplish a difficult task... My determination will not waver. Already more than 20 years have passed... ...since by trickery and lies, a little Corsican officer… We wish to leave the room... ...during the abusive indictment by this wretch! I order you to sit down. You must hear the indictment. Permission denied! You must expel us. See how far the insolence of these people goes... ...against good order! I will speak despite you, and in front of you. More than 20 years have passed, since by lies and trickery... ...a little Corsican officer… ...dared to seat himself upon the sacred throne... Guards! Let them sing. This tyrant wanted to crush Europe. To turn Europe into a mass grave. He succeeded too well! The fallen monster has paid for his crime! It remains for us to punish his accomplices. Here are his accomplices! They participated in his crimes. But even so... The hearing is adjourned. There is evidence of conspiracy... ...but there is no evidence you had any intention of dethroning the king. I could have pleaded naivety and irresponsibility. And look like fools? I put things right. You confess to anything! Touchee After your riposte. You don't know how to thrust... you always end up exposed. - 3 - all. - I don't give you the last one. That's a counter-riposte. Isn't it? - I saw nothing. - Oh, you see! - I'll do it again. - Just try to! Come on then! Didn't that touch you? Go to school, Sir! Quiet in there! Come here instead. It's serious. You didn't touch me. Yes, the third time! Come here. Sit down... ...and listen. Listen to me, Sir. Your way of defending yourself so far, has appalled us. It's suicidal. You assassinate your defenders and annihilate our pleas. We don't give a damn. In the end, we'll plead insanity. It's up to you. However, we still have hope. Your trial is arousing considerable emotion. There are small groups of protesters, and they shout "long live the Emperor". How nice of them. People in high places should be worried. Impossible to condemn you to death. Acquitted? That's not not possible, but 12 years of imprisonment... ...with a pardon being certain after 2 years. To be pardoned by good King Louis... Wouldn't that be something?! - Better than execution. - No. In short, you want to die. Yeah. But why? Why? Listen my friend, you're a good chap. But you understand nothing. That's right! Exactly that. The court won't want to sentence you to death! We can force it to. Your lawyer is extraordinary... He always finds arguments. He's dangerous... He'll lose us. No. You'll end up in a dungeon. That's what I'm talking about! What can we do to get out of it? We'll be let in to see what we have to say. We'll say whatever we want. I know the risk that I run and I accept it... ...in agreement with my companions. We don't ask for pity. We don't play at being conspirators in order to pass the time. We don't want the king granting us a mercy... ...that we never asked for. We conspired. We had 15,000 accomplices in the active army. We burned the lists. This movement nearly reached its goal... ...drive out Louis XVIII, put by foreigners on Napoleon's throne! Gentlemen, you voted according to the rules, starting with the lowest. I still have to cast my vote on the questions asked. Before doing that... ...I'll give the reasons for the determination which I'll make. For Commander Thierry, who is blind... ...he is condemned unanimously to 15 years imprisonment. For the others... you made no distinction between them, and I consider that you were right. Like four of you, I vote for the death penalty. This is not from some petty grudge... ....against these men who taunted us. I understand their attitude. Here, the only question that I have is... Have these men attempted to bloody France by revolution? Yes! They said so themselves. What is the penalty prescribed by law? The death penalty. Let us apply the law without fear or favour... ...without attempting to decide whether it is good or bad. Those who voted for this penalty have no regrets... These men want to die, they told us. Actually, considering that death is not an invention of ours... They are all going to die some day... ...our verdict will just bring the fatal hour forward. Today, instead of dying for a burst artery... ...or because of pneumonia, they will die for an idea... ...for a passion. If one day, my destiny gave me the choice... ...I know what I'd choose. Regarding military demotion... There are 3 votes "for" and 3 votes "against". My vote as president will decide the question. Demotion is a punishment that is inflicted... ...on thieves, looters, murderers and cowards. I declare that I vote "against". These men put the memory of their idol... ...above the interests of France. They weren't good Frenchmen... ...but no one can say that they were cowards. If the future brings new disasters for our country... ...I would like to be able to die for our king... ...as they will die for their emperor. The Council of War condemns Commander Thierry... ...on half pay, to the penalty of 15 years imprisonment. I knew that they would inflict this misery on me. Does a soldier need to be able to see, in order to die? Colonel Marquis de Montander, Captain Doguereau... What have you eaten? My deliverance. Lieutenants Triaire and Chouard... ...and the grenadier Goglu, are condemned to death. Death will be by firing squad. There will be no demotions. Thank you! 6 judges of the Council of War signed their petition for clemency. Good bye my friends… Goodnight everyone! I'm leaving, as first of the vanguard... ...to announce you to the Master. They refused to sign. You still have one chance. If these men refused to sign their petition for clemency... ...it is to prevent it from being refused to them. So I tried the ultimate step... ...and here's the thing, strange as it may be... The pardon is signed by His Majesty. Those condemned must consent to it. - They know that? - Not yet. - You'll take this to them. - Give it to me… But if they refuse to sign it, you give it to the head warden. - You'll remain under surveillance. - Quick... give it to me! If De Montander signs... ...he'll spend 10 years in prison. If not, he'll be shot tomorrow morning. Here's your prison pass and the royal pardon... Thank you! Say, old chap... Is our little ceremony tomorrow morning? I don't know, Colonel, I don't think so. They say that by signing the appeal, everything would work out. We can't sign it. Yesterday I heard what you said to the lawyer. Far be it from me to judge, but I think you should sign. Why? Because it would make us happy. Why would that make you happy? I don't know. You've made life bad enough for a month... ...my forcing lamps-out at 9pm. It's the regulation, Captain. And then I hadn't seen that. At home, in the closet, under the sheets... There is a cross like that. My uncle had won it in Russia. It's sort of our family treasure. When I think that this cross of my uncle's... Maybe it was you who hung on his chest... Calm down, old chap! So now it's the condemned who are consoling the guards! A lady wants to see De Montander. She has a special request. Go ahead... ...it won't be held against you. Why? Why have you come? To save you! It's your pardon. Mercy for all of you... Signed by the king. - Who gave it to you? - Sign it! - Who gave it to you? - The prefect. You're still seeing him? Yes. I begged him to make good the evil that I've caused you. I used him to betray you, and now, to save your life. 10 years imprisonment… Do you believe it? It's signed by the king. But not by me. I'll wait for you. Anything can happen... Your emperor can return. Please sign it, Gerard! It's not your tears that got you this document... - It's fear. - Of what? An uprising on the day of our execution and that our example... ...might pave the way for the return of the boy emperor. These 10 years of imprisonment... do you know what that means? But I'm sure you won't stay there for 10 years! I'm sure of it too. You think that these people love us? In few months later, Doguereau would die of pneumonia... Triaire will have escaped and I'll have hanged myself... ...in despair, over a love affair. It will be a secret assassination, in the the dungeons at night. It makes less noise than an execution. The king signed this... ...only because he fears our cause will have its martyrs. Take this evil document back to the stooge who gave it to you. You refuse? Oh no, Gerard! You've no right to worsen my crime by refusing... ...because I will have to carry alone the weight of these 8 deaths. Have pity! No, my dear, it's not you. Those who betrayed us... they're the ones who sent you. You were almost a child... wanting to avenge a beloved's death. Gerard… Gerard... I didn't love him like I love you. Thank you, Lise. Thank you, Lise. Now what can I do? I've only my honour left... Leave it to me. You never loved me! You're going to sacrifice the lives of 8 men... ...and a woman, for the ghost of your emperor who killed so many! You never knew him. Only his men knew him and loved him. If you loved him so much, you haven't the right to abandon his son... You are his only hope... Your suicide is desertion! Don't use him to help our love. He's a martyr too. And you don't have the right to decide for your men. It's because of them that I refuse... They gave me everything and I lost them by my weakness. Maybe if I was alone, I might run the risk of living. Yes, I might disarm... ...but I'd live a cowardly life... ...because of you... ...having a love to console me. Gerard! But who would console them? In prison, what would they have left? What little light would brighten their future? They have lived in glory, through epic battles... The men of Wagram and Jena and Moscow... The last charge of Leipzig, the last men left at Waterloo. They no longer have a reason to live... They are just survivors... ...from another age. They believed in the conspiracy. We are taken... The alert is given. They no longer believe in the success of the cause... But they believe in the best way to serve it... It's tomorrow morning... along a wall. Goodbye, Elise. Everyone forgave you, just as they forgave me. I see your sorrow. And I swear that I'm happy... in a selfish way... ...since I know that a woman will weep for my death. You're young. It was just a love story. You have a whole lifetime in which to forget. Goodbye. Platoon… Halt! Left... turn! Order... arms! Chouard Felix Antoine! Present! Doguereau Jean Baptiste Lucien! Present! Goglu Adolphe Gustave! Present. Huguenin Louis Cesar! Present! Foure Lucien Jacques! Present! Triaire Louis Charles! Present! De Montander Gerard Pierre! Present! Do you have at this last moment... ...anything to reveal, to relieve your conscience? No. We saw the chaplain. We all did confession together. We're all as clean as a whistle! Thanks to the Council of War to let us die in uniform. Apart from that, don't we get a drink? Not even a shot of white wine? You're a bunch of bastards! All ready, Captain! Present… arms! What do you want? Ah yes… Get over there. Ready...! Take aim...! Fire! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
