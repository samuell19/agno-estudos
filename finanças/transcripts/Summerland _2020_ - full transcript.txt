I've been waiting an hour. Where's your car? - We had a slight hiccup. - Absolutely not. - Oh, come on. Stacey. The only reason you were able to do the road trip in the first place was because they were gone for the whole month. - That's different. We can't just steal their RV. Rick will kill me. - You hate your stepdad. There is no way that they would be able to find out. They're out of the country. How are they gonna know? - Look Oliver, it's clear she doesn't wanna go and that's fine. - No, I wanna go. I just don't wanna take the RV. - Stacey, you said yourself that the one thing that you wanted to do when you left school was a road trip. Babe, this is our chance. We just need the RV. I can drive. I drove that truck that one time. - That was a pickup truck. - Yeah, it was a big one though. How much harder can an RV be? - A lot harder. - [Oliver] Hey Bray, you've driven trucks before. - [Bray] No, not this big. - Dude, whose side are you on? (sighs) Stacey. - They would kill me if I even scratched it. - We won't! We could teach you too. My car would have been too cramped anyways.

He's into girls. - No, he's gay, trust me. He wears a promise ring. - (scoffs) You weren't kidding. - Yeah like what kind of 18 year old jock hasn't slept with a dozen cheerleaders? - [Taylor] So what girl are you using? - [Bray] Oliver's girlfriend. - [Taylor] You fucking idiot. - All right, fine, we'll do it. But full tank when we return it and you guys are also cleaning it. Oh, and we're driving up to Fossil Falls and camping. Tonight. - What did you say to her? - You owe me. (R&B music) We're gonna get so fucked! - Hey, stop! - Look, we were always gonna stop along the way. We weren't just gonna drive straight there, were we? - The festival starts on Thursday. We're going literally the opposite direction. - Yeah, all right, you fucking fun sponge. So we'll leave early in the morning. Is that okay with you? She just really wants to see this place. Means a lot to her. We wouldn't even be doing this road trip if it weren't for her. I'm just saying. - All right, only for one night though. What's with the cassette? - Uh, Audio books.

We're right behind you. Yeah, you're in the RV. - Wait, how did you find us? Where do you wanna stop and meet? - Ah, we don't do that anymore. - What, meet? - Nah, we don't stop. You don't get my emails? - Dude, what does that mean? - Hah, can't get caught if you're going fast. International waters. Nothing's illegal at 90 miles an hour! (laughing) Hey pull up around here.

Christian always throws in extra shit for me. He said don't take that unless you have at least a solid 12 hours to burn. Or was it 24? (chill hip hop music) - It's this right here. It's been like four years since I was here last with my family. We used to come up every spring. - Why don't we just stay in the RV? - I mean you can. Nice catch, idiot. - Fuck RVs. Rick always bring that massive house into the woods. Defeats the entire purpose. - So salmon can only swim upstream. Whoa, they can swim up that waterfall. - Ollie, no, what the hell is that book telling you? They can't swim from up that, it's massive. You can cliff jump over there though. My cousin used to give me so much shit for not jumping. - Oh yeah? You're doing it with me this time though, right? Damn, I haven't even seen a waterfall before. We could swim with the salmon! - Don't they have waterfalls in England? - No, not really. - Isn't it an island though? - I mean technically, everything's an island. - Oliver, no. - Are you still thinking of going back to visit this summer? - Uh, Yeah. Yeah, I think so. - Man, I'd love to come with you. I've never seen Europe before. - Europe's cool. I have an idea. Well I was gonna save them for the festival but I think we should do them right now. - I don't know dude, those are pretty crazy. - [Oliver] Nah, it's just like weed. - It doesn't look like weed. - Well I'll roll them in a joint and it'll look just like weed. - You know that doesn't work, right? - Right, why don't we save them for the festival? - I guess we're doing them then. - All right, fuck it. - Mmm.

For someone who loves Ram Dass so much he should be happy I'm getting rid of it. - [Oliver] God, you're beautiful. What? Is this my jumper, did you steal this? - She still doesn't know. - She can't know. - Well that's the plan. - Well, Bray, if that's the plan, you have both of them going to the same music festival. - Yeah and I'm working on a way to tell Shawn that Victoria died on the way there. - Yeah, that'll work perfectly. - Look, I'll break off on my own and I'll find him before she does. - Bray, you're in so deep. So deep, deep, deep down in your own dark moist hole. I mean listen! You, pretending to be Stacey. Stacey going to the festival. Shawn looking for Stacey at the festival. - I get it, Taylor. - I don't know if you do. I mean how are you not a ball of complete anxiety right now?

I have a plan. - You sure you don't want one? - I can't. - So you've never had meat? - I wasn't allowed it growing up so don't really miss it. - Can't miss something you've never tried. - I'm gonna go see if they have salad. - This ain't bad. - I couldn't live without meat.

It's complicated now. She knows I have to go back. - I left a girl once. For the road. You should join us. On the road. Can't get deported if you're moving. - Oliver, are you from under the Earth? - No, I'm from London. - Okay, and you're going to the festival to reconcile. Bray, what about you? - I'm supposed to meet a guy. - Mm, I see you. You both are going for the love, that's cool. I like that. - Oliver, it's super easy to get over a girl, all right? All you gotta do is say, whip it! (can hissing) - I love that you don't do drugs, Oliver. We need more people like that. It's bad for your body. (can hissing) - [Bray] Do you want us to help pitch? I've got some money. - No, Bray, don't even worry about it, bro. I got this. - You know, I really love this van. I could actually see myself in one someday. - Bray, you was just in one. You know Bray, I'm a little whipped up right now. But you seem nervous, I'm sensing something from you. - I just don't think I'm what he's expecting. - Oh, the guy. Just be yourself, Bray. Love is love. Man, you know, I was gay once. And I was seeing this guy. And I was acting and pretending to be what I thought he wanted me to be. But uh, it turns out, he just wanted the real me, the person he met initially. And then things ended quickly. And now, whenever I see anyone relationshiply, I just be myself. I be me, Bray. Because people want to be with you, the real you, you know? - Yeah. - Yeah. Bray you just gotta live the best life you can be. If you can't love yourself, how can you love somebody else?

Get out of my van. - Stacey has the tickets, doesn't she? - Yup. - Perfect. So, we jump the fence, we find Stacey before Shawn does. And you know what, you can just do whatever you want. - [Bray] Sounds good. - [Oliver] So I have to ask, why a Christian dating website? - [Bray] I don't know man, it started as a joke at first and then Shawn messaged me. - Right. - He's different, you know? He likes me for who I am. - Except the part where he thinks you have a vagina. I guess this is as good as it's gonna get. All right. Okay, so she was at the main stage about an hour ago. - [Bray] This place is weird. - Oh wait! She's at the, what does that say? Boogaloo. What the fuck's a boogaloo? - Hey. - Hi. - Wow, you're even more beautiful in person. (somber music) - Very forward. - I was getting nervous that you weren't gonna make it. - What? - [Bray] Oliver! - Fuck off. - We could fix this. - Fix it? There's nothing left to fix. You fucked this whole thing up. - What? - She wouldn't have run away if you hadn't fucking told her! - That is not fair. You weren't even gonna tell her. You gotta stop just ignoring all your problems. - Righteous advice, coming from you, don't you think? You're a piece of shit, Bray. - Bray. It's Bray, right? - Uh, yeah. - Shawn from Denver. - Yeah, from the phone. - Yeah. I have had the strangest day. - Yeah? - Yeah. Did she ever like, mention me, Victoria? - Yeah, she said she really wanted to meet you. - Really? That's weird because she acted like she didn't even know who I was. - I know what you mean. Some people just seem different over text. - Yeah I guess so, but it's like we talked for so long. - Yeah, I know. - Before, there was something so real about her. Like I was talking with somebody who really understood who I was. And I've never really had that before. - Sometimes you just gotta be real with yourself before you can be real with other people. But you can't project that onto others, you know. You just gotta know who and what you are deep down. - It's weird, I feel I can't be myself around anybody back home. Like I really don't like any of the girls in my hometown. - Really? - Yeah. I guess I'm doomed. (chuckling) - Shawn. I need to tell you something. - Oh, it's Victoria. - [Oliver] Fucking hell. - God, I'm an idiot! - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - [Christian] You're an asshole. - I can explain. - What were you expecting? - I thought it wouldn't matter if I was a guy. (bashing) - Be real with yourself before you're real with other people. What kind of advice is that to give someone? - Damn, Bray. You got knocked the fuck out. I'm guessing Shawn took it well. - [Bray] Yup. - Did you tell him that? - [Bray] Yup. - Oh, yikes. You know what, this guy actually seems pretty cool. Maybe you did have something. I mean it doesn't change the fact that you lied. - I was trying to be myself. - You know, you can be a real moppet sometimes. - Yeah, I guess I thought that wouldn't matter. - It might matter to some people though, you know? I'm sorry. You'll find someone. You could come to England. There are plenty of you motherfuckers out there prancing about. - Yeah, maybe. - Well what do you wanna do? We could stick around and catch some more of the bands. - No, I think I'm ready to go home. - What? Why, we just got here. I don't even know how we're gonna get home. - What are you gonna do about Stacey? - It's pretty clear I'm not the best for her. (ducks quacking) You know male ducks don't quack? Pretty gnarly. - [Announcer] Finally returning to the stage, motherfucking Count Jermaine and the Carpet Cleaners! - This song goes out to my boys Oliver and Bray.
