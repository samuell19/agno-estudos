Carrie said she'd give you a kiss if you do it. - Shut up, Matt! - Hey. It's me, Arthur Dean. I grew crops for the colony. - Get away from me! Get off me! - I'm here to help you. I'm the one who patched your arm. - There's something out there. I just wanna go home. - I'm sorry, home is gone. - What is that? - It's like a wound. An open wound, a tear. Creatures can pass through it. We can put a bandage on it, but it won't fully heal. It was the job of the colony to maintain that bandage. Whoever opened that door let a lot of people die. - Sorry. - I'll only ask two things of you. One, that you never let anyone open that door. And two, that you never touch this briefcase. Do you understand? You know, when... when I have trouble falling asleep, I try to get quiet enough so that I can count my own heartbeat. Will you try that for me? One. Two.

Some of the creatures are created directly from the portal. Others are created right here on Earth with the help of these rocks. If she's out there, there are probably others. That's why it's so important that we train. Whoever opened that door let a lot of people die. If she's out there, there are probably others. That's why it's so important that we train. - Are you going to open it? - Carrie? Carrie! Carrie, are you okay? Carrie. My god. Why would you take on those things without me? - Because it was me! I let the Brute out of the door! I made my friend open it! It was my fault! I swear, I thought it was just a story! I just... If only I had this when the Brute got out. No one would have died. - Keep moving. He'll catch up. - AD? - Brute, Brute, come out of your hole and beat the living black as coal.
