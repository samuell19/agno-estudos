Did you manage to reach? Unfortunately, not at the right time I'll get you out next time What are you doing? Clean the floor .Sorry Clean up .in the next time ! Do not forget Can't you stand up straight? - Go home - Expired? Yes, it's over ! Both After much trouble, the man died in the coffin What a bad ending! Why does everyone want a successful escape from prison? Uncle Song This ending is much more exciting This story is normal This is the exciting story They are using a technique called “montage” For editing video clips as well as sound effects The excitement "you feel is a hoax". Have you ever seen the films of the director Hitchhiker? That's the real excitement! ! You are You watched "The Shawshank Redemption", right? ! Yes Great movie Then tell me What is "The Shawshank Redemption" about? ! Freedom Freedom, give me freedom What was that famous quote? It was about birds that are not locked up "I must remind myself that some birds are not trapped." Birds have very shiny feathers. There was another quote that I liked the most "These walls are funny." "First you hate it" "Then you get used to it." Then enough time passes to make you depend on her. Oh for that precious quote The most valuable thing is to close your damn mouth ! Return to the company I wonder Why is the bastard "Sangkun" hanging out here these days? Don't you know? There is a man who lives on Lunhua Street He won the lottery and was killed ...Sangcon Pretending to investigate but it is in fact It is focused on everyone here ...I heard that Chief of Police Iowa Batum .لارون She is handling this case herself I didn't get an adequate education, but if I were the chief of police But I would solve this case in a minute Uncle Song! If you watch more than a thousand movies You will realize that everything is possible in this world I regret the incompetence of the policemen here What policemen? These are on TV Keep saying the nonsense I will charge you or beat you Put the bill on my account .OK ...Say what happened? Officer I have told you the story three times On the 15th of March, Brasong took everyone to drink to celebrate his winning the lottery .buzz Since we live in the same building I took him home After I put him on the bed, I went back to my room I have invited friends to play cards And having to take care of Brasong . We couldn't start until 10:30 p.m. We played until three in the morning At about nine in the morning, I went to wake him up to work But he didn't answer me I was worried So I kicked the door As soon as I opened the door, I saw him lying on the bed I called the police immediately .That's it According to the autopsy report Brasong was strangled to death with a rope The time of death was around one o'clock in the morning on the sixteenth But at the time I was ... playing cards with my friends They can testify in my favor , I know you were playing cards But at the same time you killed Brasong ! You are joking I worked as a police officer for over two decades, and I never saw a clean crime scene without any traces whatsoever Unusually, police officers searched only the victim's apartment But the place they should have searched is the basement They had to search your apartment It is true that you took him back to his apartment and left immediately A person cannot be in two places at the same time You have taken advantage of what is called an axiom to create an argument of absence that works for you I'm going to take a breath .OK This case is not limited to the "time" of the crime Rather, the "distance" of the crime Do you have evidence? The fingerprint report will be ready soon You will not get away with your crime Inexplicable You solved a strange case in just one day If you scrutinize a thousand cases carefully, you will realize that there is no "impossible" case to solve ! But Where did you find that rope? We even searched the trash containers nearby ! And all of them were already empty It was easy to find the same type of rope used in the crime by examining the signs of strangulation ...if Forged? Is this important? Sheep without a shepherd !

I know you are hateful to Lee Wiji It's different this time If Lauren finds out that I have taken advantage of her son's accident We are both in trouble I remember what I saw well! It was the weekend! I've been drinking there all night I remembered And also there was The guy running the noodle cart .I did not see him We both saw it! Do not you remember?

I asked if you were sure. .There is nothing wrong .Do not be afraid If you don't know, simply say it You are just a child . Nobody will blame you for not remembering you Remember, they do not have any evidence So they can't do anything for us But they will do everything they can to wrest our recognition from us They might behave more terrifyingly than I just did They might hit your father Will they hurt you? When you make a mistake .وأعاقبكِ does it hurt? .A little But not a terrible pain Then your dad won't experience a terrible pain either .There is nothing wrong Bingbing, take your sister to bed .Let's go .Let's go Will the police find out about us? It's just a matter of time So, is our plan Will you succeed? If one of those people ...he clearly remembers us, then Of course, they will remember clearly Why don't we arrest Lee Wiji? That's enough, Sangquin I have known Li Wijie for a long time He's a good man. He would n't do something like this Unless you have conclusive evidence, then I'll believe what you say What? I have important information, Commander Schath went to a summer camp a week before his disappearance There were two girls in the camp from Shanban One of them is Li Weiji's daughter Ping Sheep with poor eyesight can easily get lost So they are often eaten by megafauna Did everyone understand? Yes? The director wants to see Ping "Go," Bing It's Swhat How do you know him? We met at the camp Do you know each other well? .Both .Smattering لماذا تكذبين؟ There were a lot of students in that ! Camp, you won't recognize it at a single glance Do you think I am an idiot? Don't try to deny your knowledge of Swhat "Only superficial knowledge." Of course, they will invent evidence to trick you into confessing But whatever they ask you Just remember that I only met Schuch once, at the camp The only way to get evidence It is by taking advantage of your fear As long as you are not afraid They can't do anything Schat was the infamous campground To sneak photos of girls on his mobile phone One of the girls yelled at him because of it Did you see him after camp? .Both ! Liar We know he came to you after his summer camp On the 2nd of April It's impossible Did Schucht say this? Yes, that's what he said .He's a liar You told me on April 2nd? I wasn't even in town on this date Our entire family was far away Where were you on April 2nd? .لوا باتوم When did you come back? We left in the morning and returned the next evening How can you remember clearly after a few days have passed? That was the weekend And we haven't gone on a family trip in a long time Additionally, this wasn't that long ago Then you are sure That you haven't seen Swatch after camp? Yes, I did not see him .OK You can leave then . Bingbing is a good student, you will not lie Is this Lee Wiji's house? .Yes Perfect timing Wigi! Bingbing called, and she said you talked to her at school Did something happen? We just asked her a few questions .OK Have you seen this boy? ! Both How about this car? ! Both His name is Schat He's the son of Police Chief of Iowa Batum He disappeared more than ten days ago He had gone to Shanban before that I ask you two reasons Your daughter Bing knows Sochat And Sangkun said He saw you driving his yellow car around Behind this jungle I saw you with my own eyes There's no doubt Swhat is here We were not home on April 2nd and 3rd We went to Loa Batum, the whole family We did not return until the evening of the third day .Yes The game is over, Lee Wiji Commander! We don't need to look for more evidence Everything was revealed Why are you still laughing? I didn't mention specific times I never said when I saw you Your wife's tongue slipped Don't take her off She is impatient Didn't she talk to Bingbing at her school? The child didn't know what happened So she called and told us what questions you asked her Suddenly, the police went to Bingbing School What scared her Sangkun said you were here on the morning of April 3rd What does he mean by your driving? There is no way to explain that Everyone knows the amount of hatred Sanggun's heart has towards me No matter what I say, he will accuse me of lying Tell me your story then Actually, from the morning of the second day to the evening of the third day Our family went to Iowa Batum We were not in Shanban , So either this is a mistake Or someone is lying ! You are lying Don't treat us as idiots Do you have any evidence to support your words? On the morning of the second day We went to Loa Batum by bus The bus? You have counted these receipts carefully, so you can show them to the police You even kept the bus tickets, when most people don't We don't have a lot of money So we keep our receipts to control our expenses Are you telling me that you are poor while you live in this huge house? Right next to the cemetery! Would you have bought this house? Anyway, if you don't believe us Go and question the people I mentioned Everyone can support our story I definitely saw him on the third day of the month You were drinking all night, can you guarantee your mind was clear? I'm willing to bet my badge Let's report to President Laron Commander, honestly If it turns out, it's Lee Wiji We didn't tell Laron We'll be in trouble ! My Father Will the police be convinced of our story? Will the police be convinced of our story? Annan! Stop scratching the table! They will come to us again ! Here you are Fried rice noodles to take out Won't you eat here? I'm busy solving a big issue Missing person But let me teach you We have made great progress We found a yellow Honda at the bottom of the lake , add to that , In the seat creases We found bristles that do not match Schata's hair This is definitely fishy It's true Here is your request! .Come with us From the second of April to the evening of the third day where have you been? , لوا باتوم , with my family in vacation? In order to work Since it was the weekend I took my family with me When did you arrive in Loa Batum? .Afternoon After one o'clock After one o'clock When did you arrive in Loa Batum? If we all give the same answer It would look very fishy Especially when it comes to time And other numbers Your mom and I will give exact answers But you shouldn't .I do not remember It was afternoon When we went to buy a cake There weren't many customers at that time What did you do on the evening of the second day of April? We went to a boxing match Then we went back to the hotel which hotel? Three seasons Tell me about the match what about her? All you can remember Whatever you remember Lies are easy to spot But there wouldn't be any problem telling the truth So we just need to remember What happened that day We say everything as it happened Don't try to make up something that hasn't happened There were five boxing matches that day The blue team surprisingly won its first four rounds It was the most memorable thing Chatucha beat the Veteran King of Boxing with one blow Weigi was so excited that day He accidentally bumped into the popcorn seller We had to pay $24 for him I remember when the boxer won I cried excitedly When did the match start? When the policeman asks you a question Listen carefully before responding It really started when we got there ! Error Your father said it started after you got there You waited half an hour, isn't that true? Is this not true? Whatever they say Stick to your story No, my dad is wrong The match has already started how's it going? How do you catch just random people? They even took the kids! Bingbing and Anan at the police station? How strange! Why are you arresting two girls? Are you here to watch? "Tell them to release a family," Lee said They set them free Let the kids go first You made a mistake, release them now Yes, they set them free ! Madam People gathered in the basement Don't worry about them We didn't know anything Maybe they are telling the truth They were all in Loa Batum on the second and third days Did the car’s movements follow us? The last time she appeared on camera It was the second afternoon In Shanban town It has never appeared since The last call made from the Sochat phone The signal appears He was here In Shanban Are you sure? .I am sure On the morning of the third day Leave Shanban in your son's car Did you see the driver? It was Lee Wiji .there is something wrong I am sure he was in Shanban on those two days If they're making up the story Then I'll find everyone mentioned in this story Look for everyone they are usually associated with They brought them here one by one for interrogation I get it Let them go home now Let them relax and think that everything is fine They have been removed from our shoulders It's just the beginning Wigi! Luigi, everything is fine now ! OK .Count How can the police be sure you have a connection with that child's disappearance? We must be behind this During these two days of the weekend They were all in Loa Batum Nobody was in Shanban .do not worry I will support your argument for absence Thank you, Uncle Song Okay, I'll be back at the store ! Madam We had the dogs of spotting the bodies search the area I didn't find anything Wigi! Let me know if you need help I have known Wiji since he was a child He was an orphan He is a good man, he works very hard This is not what I asked you about Did he come to your restaurant on the second and third days of April? He came almost every day But during those two days, he didn't come You are fooling us ! Both You know I love Thai boxing On the second day of the month There was a match between Chatuchak and Ipracha I couldn't go But Uiji was gone when he was in Loa Batum He talked about it when he got back I was supposed to go with him to Luo Batum on the second day of the month But something went wrong with a customer's equipment here in Shanban So I couldn't go Take a bus to Loa Batum in the morning I remember clearly Many people take your bus every morning, how can you be sure? I know Wiji very well Veteran boxing champion Ibracha played a match that day I am a fan I remember this family They ordered another cake to take out ! Great, thanks Cake out I participated in the perfect kitchen program! Have you seen this? My wife and I love this program She makes this cake at home too But, to be honest It's not as delicious as your cake Well, we've been counting it for decades Don't complain about your wife's cooking So as not to quarrel Dad don't dare to .its enough What was the date? Second of April You didn't even think, you have a good memory Officer, is it a crime to have a good memory? We are old-fashioned, our circuit is not equipped with surveillance cameras Even it is impossible to broadcast matches Do you not record matches? Yes, we do, we record it ... But those cameras are aimed at the ring, not at the crowd I saw them on April 2nd, yeah .I'm sorry Sir, be careful .Sorry You're so clumsy How much do we owe you? B $24 Buy a box for Annan Annan, do you want popcorn? .Yes Is it sweet or salty? .Both of them A box of each kind, how much is sausage and beer? B. $24 each Two hot dogs and a can of beer Ninety dollars, please .This is too expensive I don't have enough money , I have to go out and pull some Bring us our food later Did he go outside to withdraw cash? .Yes Have you found surveillance cameras for the cinema and the night market? We are still looking Look into the ATM's surveillance camera as well .OK That's right, I called them on the evening of the first day of the month To tell them to come to repair the hotel network the next day Our entire system was down, and we couldn't wait an extra day When did they arrive at the hotel? I can't remember the exact time, but it was in the afternoon The whole family Little disagreement occurred when they were logging in لماذا؟ Why did you disagree? They only reserved one room for all of them The registration of their departure was late They should have paid extra fees according to our regulations But Mr. Lee was not pleased with this , Because it came to fix our network We waive these additional fees Do you have the recordings from the hotel's surveillance cameras? Yes, but it only starts in the afternoon of the third day of the month Old records have not been deleted in a while It takes up a lot of space Yes, it is annoying to delete it It will be easier to delete it For reprogramming Did you allow him to delete the recordings? We had no reason to keep the old records Get out Even without the hotel recordings Lee Weigi cannot speak to everyone to testify falsely in his favor But his eyes testify against him My intuition is never wrong What's the missing link here? Leave me alone for a while .Yes We will leave now Is there any news? Do you still care for your son? ! Of course This isn't the first time he's running away from home Don't worry too much When can you come here?
