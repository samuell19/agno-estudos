It's like being in a cradle of spicy scent. Yes, it's an exciting feeling when consciousness awakens on an alien planet. Everything around you rushes and vibrates. Like in a fog that's hard to penetrate. It obscures one's vision and mind. - Kat. Where's Don? - He's still sleeping. - What did you do? - I woke first and did a few routine tests while you were waking up. You're tougher than a cat. Wherever we go, you always fall on your feet. In the past, you could have been a great scholar. I envy those generations. If I imagine it as 100,000 years ago, you could have been someone like Einstein or Madame Curie, It brings a lump to my throat. What's left to us, their late descendants?! Our ancestors have taken every chance of great inventions and heroic deeds. Only the routine and the "Game" stayed with us. - What's the planet like? - Incomprehensible. Incomprehensible, to what extent? The air is breathable, the robots would have given out protective clothing otherwise. The temperature is pleasant. Quite springlike. This fragrant vegetation is beautiful and the trees strange. Look at the micro-level footage! These are no plants. They are made of plastic, even the rocks. Nothing lives. My limbs are getting stiff. As if ants were under my skin. What are you saying? Is there nothing alive? No. These bushes, these trees... They are all made of plastic? Yes, made of plastic. There's nothing which can't be explained with some reasonable thought. Let's break up and discuss it in the city. Let's not rush. How mysterious this planet is. But only so long as we don't solve its secret. That's the interesting thing about it. The adventure and the "Game". Come on! We've no time for chatter. We have to examine everything carefully. - We've examined enough. Come on. You see, the living beings here destroyed the vegetation and replaced it with plastic. They don't tolerate any kind of life near their city. We have to expect the worst here. - Then expect it while we go on! Come on, let's go to the city! PLANET OF THE ORCHIDS Based on a novel by Translation: Screenplay: Adapted by: Starring: Meteors! Those aren't meteors, but projectiles. Projectiles or meteors, what difference does it make? - Not one bit. Why didn't you help? I didn't know how. Suddenly, I had goose bumps and started to feel afraid. Somehow I have a bad foreboding. Either you participate in the "Game" or you are outside! We'll solve the mystery of this planet without you. Excuse me! Then I'll go ahead and chase away all the monsters! Alright, let's go! He's dead. Can't we do anything for him? Nothing. His chest is shattered. Are you crazy? It will destroy us. We have to explore these buildings. What's there? - Nothing. There is no entrance. Everything is only decoration. Maybe this is not a city at all. But only a kind of ant hill. Ants don't produce plastic. And here everything is made of plastic. They aren't houses if there is no window and no door. Yes, maybe they aren't houses. Maybe this is just the periphery. Maybe it's just a park where people stroll. People? That's the problem of looking for people everywhere in space. and being surprised to never find them. We must look for intelligence. And intelligence hardly ever appears in human form. Maybe we are being watched, maybe we'll be shot at. Are you crazy? - What is this mystery? What is hiding here? Why is it so elusive? I'd rather be attacked or killed. This passivity drives me crazy. Threatening. We may not be seen, but perceived. This penetrating scent could come from the sensors there. They would not make their world so colourful if they could not see. The colours and shapes are designed to be luxuriated in. I just don't understand why they didn't build in regular shapes. Think of the evolution of architecture on Earth! First we built cubes and rectangular shaped houses and then skyscrapers in the form of petals, snails and shells. In memory of the nature that we had destroyed. How strange we are. They lie in wait for us bloodthirstily. And we talk about architecture. Come along. Now I am afraid. Everything in me is resisting. You know you don't have to be afraid. Nobody can harm us. We are the most advanced beings in interstellar space. We constantly state how great we are. And when we encounter a world like this, we don't understand it. We see the buildings and can't comprehend them. They shoot at us like rabbits, but we don't know who's shooting. We don't know, why. Sure, we've never met such an advanced culture like this. It's more developed than ours. More developed. More developed than humanity. Our computers were therefore wrong. It was said that it was impossible to improve on our level of development. Whole generations lived in the mistaken belief that they couldn't perfect themselves. I don't understand that. I have no idea who lives here and how, and if this is a living room. If this is an apartment, what are the metal spheres for? Where is the furniture, the utensils? Where are the living beings? - Maybe it's a trap? Maybe they have been absorbed by some kind of energy. No. I don't think this is a trap. We came here by chance. Perhaps the inhabitants got into their homes through magnetism. If so, we have to find out. We have to be in the right place. This lake is like a fairy tale. - The romantic in you loves this idea. Yes, one can't help but enjoy it. We shouldn't rush. I'd like to enjoy the beauty of this strange world. Come on, we have a mystery to solve. This is the real centre of the city. It's a machine world. A robot world. This is neither an adventure nor the "Game". Who's opened the gate for us? We'll find out. This is an opportunity you have been waiting for. If we are attacked and separated, we'll meet here until we've solved the mystery. I like your persistence. I got him. Are you crazy? That's not why we are here. You'll only make the situation worse. I understand. We've lost the "Game". But who cares about the "Game"? Do you think it's them? For sure. Maybe it's only them. Drop your gun! I'll shoot if you move! That's not according to the rules. You don't have the right to do that. I don't have the right to hinder the other team as long as the "Game" is in progress. But, since the "Game" is over... I can do what I want. Why do you say the "Game" is over? Have you solved the planet's secret? Yes. The inhabitants left the planet for some reason. Only the robots and machines are still working. And the central office has accepted this? Certainly. They'll name the planet after me. They'll archive the 3D images that I've submitted to them. Congratulations, Jak. You've won. But it wasn't really fair to shoot at us. That was a deliberate obstruction of the competitors. We only shot after we had already discovered the secret. We didn't take soil samples, but stormed straight to the finish. Ask the central office. Where did you find the weapons? In the big building over there. A museum. You can get everything there, I even found an atomic rocket. Come, let's fire one. We saw one in history class at visualization school. This planet gives us the chance to do something more meaningful. What do you think about a closer examination? Unnecessary things bore me. Listen to me! We have always found extinct cultures, one abandoned planet after another. The majority of which had been destroyed in an era of nuclear wars. Something else happened here, they survived the time of nuclear wars. They were more reasonable, they managed to make more progress than we ourselves. Understand? - Yes. And what now? Here one can find answers to the question of why nature was already in retreat when there were still rational beings here. Yes, but I don't care. One can't learn anything from these half-educated robots. I connected them to the interstellar computer. It found out nothing at all. Maybe we'll find out more than the interstellar computer. Don't make a fool of yourself. Leave, if you're afraid of the rocket launch. I won't allow it - You won't? I've solved the mystery of the planet. I can do what I want. We are already looking for a new planet while looking around here. You don't know how this rocket works. If it malfunctions, we'll all blow up. - No. It's burned to the ground. Madness. We got so lazy that we can't take anything seriously anymore. We messed up... We messed up. Our fathers messed up, they taught us to think only of ourselves. We all want our house, our garden, our planet, our prosperity. Everyone thinks that what they've achieved is enough. The rational beings of this planet may have developed into machines and are here in front of us. I think the machines have become rational. We saw the houses, the streets have disappeared, the city is empty. And the machines and equipment are still working. This is only possible if the machines themselves have become more and more perfect. And they have developed a kind of human intellect. I am the judge. I am the judge. Maybe "judge" is the wrong word. Are you some kind of emissary? Does anyone want to contact us? Nobody wants to talk to you. I am the judge. You face the court. How do you know our language? Since you came to the planet, we have recorded everything, every sound. We have decoded the meaning of your words. We could decode them by the way you speak. An enormous opportunity. We have to take it now. You have no chance. Your case looks bad. Are you machines? Yes. In the service of rational beings. To use your words... the people. Are these rational beings alive? Yes, they live. We protect them. Then Judge, how long will you be available to us? What do you want from him? - Wait. How long will you be available to us? Until the end of the trial, of course. Are you ready to listen to us after the trial? Of course. Although I do not think that will happen after the verdict. What do you want from him? We must find this planet's rational beings, and we have to play by their rules. For the first time in the history of the universe two rational cultures will meet. You have entered the atmosphere of our planet. You took a nuclear missile from the museum and detonated it. 42 people died in the explosion. 120 were injured. That is why I condemn you to death. No. We didn't do that. - We didn't fire the rocket. But you were there. Our recordings clearly show that you were present at the ignition. Why did you come to this planet? We compete, we play occasionally. We are looking for planets. Whoever finds one first, may give it their name. And why are you playing this "Game"? To pass the time. And it has a goal? For the first 10,000 years of the space age, we sent spaceships to distant star systems. Posterity named these planets after those researchers. We thought we were the most intelligent beings as we found no one with a comparable culture. And what should we strive for, if so? The research lost its original goal, and so it became a party game. How do you move through space? We refuse to testify. Why did you arrive in two teams? I told you, we are in competition. The "Game" is more interesting so. You attacked each other and destroyed each other. It was just a game. Is that just a game for you? I do not understand how you do it, but you cross the borders of the stellar systems. You have the opportunity to expand your knowledge, yet you only devastate by playing. Are you rational beings? I condemn you to death. In the name of reason I will destroy you. We ask for you, Judge, that we may explain it to you! What do you want? You can't destroy us, get it? I don't understand. I burned you to dust. But you can't destroy us. We ask for you, Judge, that we may explain it to you! You can't destroy us. Do you really think you won't be condemned this way? You can't condemn us. We're invulnerable. I don't understand. We'll reveal our mystery if you lead us to the most rational beings on this planet, we want to see them. That makes no sense. It is very important to us. We want to see them face to face. Agreed. Tell me the secret. We didn't travel here from Earth. The body, the matter you see, comes from your own planet. I don't understand. You are made of the matter of our planet. Didn't you notice that we came to your city without equipment? That we breathe this planet's air? If we resemble living beings here, is it not possible for us to breathe and live the same way? Yes, I couldn't understand that. Your appearance was incomprehensible and I was unable to process it. We travel nowhere. Instead, we sit at home at a game console. We make an exact copy of ourselves on a distant planet and control it remotely. So you are in fact not here? We feel that we are here. We feel the heat, the pain, the fear, but in reality everything is just a game. For us, the "Game" is so realistic that we don't leave the house. We used to watch films and identified with their heroes. Now using electronics we are the adventurers. Yes, we are here on your planet, enjoying the excitement, but without taking risk. Turn around. These are the people here. The people? Yes, they have evolved. I don't believe it. How did you imagine them? I don't know, differently. Not like that. They are more like plants. Like orchids. How could humans develop into plants like these? We proved that it is impossible to travel between distant solar systems. We accepted that pleasure is the sole purpose of life. They can't move. Why should they move? Where are their heads? They don't need to see. We take care of everything. We provide them with food, different experiences, entertainment and adventures with the help of these rays. Where are their brains? The brain is the full petal. Most parts of the body have died. The brain has opened up to allow experience beams and nutrient solutions. May we talk to them? They no longer speak. But they think. Why should they think? Thinking is only needed for problem solving. They have no more problems. They have only to enjoy their lives and we feed them with all their experiences. They have become a calyx in order to able to allow the experience in all their cells. How do they propagate? They are immortal. Therefore, reproduction is not needed. We could therefore contact them. It is not needed to make contact with anyone. Dirty machines. I'll crush you. They can't be cared for without them. They only do what people have programmed them to do. We have overcome nature. We have always made our world more comfortable. This is the danger lurking. We live only for ourselves. We'll become plants. Do you still have any questions? No, thank you. Turn off now! Do whatever you want with our avatars. We will never return. I'll destroy the machines. No! We need the machines! - We have to continue our research. The human mind and research must never come to an end. Subtitles: nitverstan, corvusalbus
