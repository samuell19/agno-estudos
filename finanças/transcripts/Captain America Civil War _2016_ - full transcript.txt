Longing Rusted Seventeen Daybreak Furnace Nine Benign Homecoming One Freight car Good morning, Soldier. Ready to comply. I have a mission for you. Sanction and extract. No witnesses. Well done Soldier. All right, what do you see? Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It's a good target. There's an ATM on the south corner, which means? Cameras. Both cross streets are one-way. So, compromised escape routes. Means our guy doesn't care about being seen. He isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block? Yeah, the red one? It's cute. It's also bulletproof, which means private security... which means more guns... which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us. You guys know I can move things with my mind, right? Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature. Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid? Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something? Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him. If he sees us coming, that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us. Sam... see that garbage truck? Tag it. Give me X-ray. That truck's loaded for max weight. And the driver's armed. It's a battering ram. - Go now. - What? He's not hitting the police. Body armour, AR-15s. I make seven hostiles. I make five. Sam. Four. Rumlow's on the third floor. Wanda, just like we practised. What about the gas? Get it out. Pack it up. He's here. Rumlow has a biological weapon. I'm on it.
