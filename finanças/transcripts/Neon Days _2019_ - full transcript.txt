Depression... Anxiety... Anger issues... Anti-social habits, eating disorder, trouble sleeping. You, uh... You added your own checkboxes? Yeah, I just want to make sure I got it all covered. Troubled past and probably cancer. That's, uh... - Yeah. - Oh, that's something. You think you have cancer? Mm. What kind? Testicular. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't think it's very professional for you to laugh about that. You're absolutely right, I'm sorry. Hey, hey, hey! I am sorry. And you're right. You ever think you might have hypochondria? What's that? It's basically when you think there's something wrong with you or you're sick but you're actually fine. Yeah. That's... Can I see that for a second? I need a pen. Hyp... O... Hey, Macy. Hmm. Do you work this day? What day? The Skills on Wheels thing. It's the Saturday before Christmas. I don't know, probably. Mitchell always gives me freaking Saturday shifts! You know that. So, this girl. She likes you? I mean, she more than likes me. She's obsessed with me. Mhm. She stares at me all the time. So her feelings for you, the way she acts. They're exactly what you want? Right. Yeah. Then I think I'm a little confused as to why you would make these, uh, interactions between you two so awkward if they don't have to be. If I make everything perfect, then it's not authentic enough. Can you explain that? Nothing in our world is perfect. Including the relationships. Okay. So, if our conversations went perfectly every time, then... it would bring me out. I would lose focus. So an imperfect world, to you, is perfect? I mean... it definitely makes it a lot more believable. Hmm. How long have you been painting? I don't know. Ever since I was young. Do you like it as much now as you did when you were young? I try to. I don't think I enjoy it the same way. Why is that? Shouldn't you know why? I have a pretty good idea but I want to hear what you think. I guess... I don't do it because it makes me happy. Or to fill any sort of void. I do it because... it makes me feel normal? Normal. Does your family know about this? No, no, and they never will. I don't talk to them anymore so... You don't talk to your family? Nope! Well... - do you want to talk about... - Nope! Okay. Okay. You know I do find it very interesting that... That you know this, uh, this group of people so well. But you keep yourself so hidden. Why's that interesting? Tells me a lot about who you are. How so? Well, it tells me that you have enough courage to know them, to associate with them. But you don't have enough courage to really know who they are. What are you afraid of, Jake? Alright. You useless sacks of oxygen! Your fearless leader has arrived. Yeah, you wasted sacks of oxygen! Thanks! Ow! - Dammit, Jake! - Sorry, hand slipped. Hey, Mitchy! My main man! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What did I say about calling me that? Sorry. - Is everybody here? - Yeah, I think so. Good! Let's begin. Macy! Office! That'll be 30 dollars. Have fun! Thirty bucks! Brandon. Snack Bar! Liam! - Skate Shop. - Next to him? And you two wonderful human beings... rentals! Oh! No, come on. Oh, crap! Okay. [birds chirping - Hey, guys! - You're late. Uh, sorry. I lost track of time. My main man! How's it going? He is not your main man. Stop lying, fool! Well... Jake! Good to see you, man! I missed you. It's been what? Thirty-six hours since our last meeting? Uh, yeah, I guess. Jake. I like having you around but... did you notice something when you rode up here on that piece of shit in two wheels? - Ben! Come on, man. - No, no, no, no, no, no! Seriously, did you notice something? Um... You were walking back and forth? Walking back, uh, yeah! What I was doing was sinking deep into thought. Pacing from side to side, to and from, if you will. Talking to William about the new draft that I have. He was talking about the new guide. - Ugh! Have you no manners? - Okay! - You know what! Okay? - Yeah, I will! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Slow down. This guide. What's he talking about with that? Ben has these stupid notes on how to find the perfect girl. - Really? - Yeah, but it doesn't work. I mean... I followed it. I... checked off all the boxes but, um... it never worked. So, what? Is that why you guys meet? Yeah. Every few days. We talk about how the guide helped us and what needs to be changed. Okay. Congratulations. Oh! Yeah. Yeah, I found a good one. What's up with that? What's that? You didn't tell me about it. Well, you're here to talk. I'm here to listen. You and Ben. Two single guys. Got this get-laid guide. Mhm. Wait, what? Now what about this third guy, William? Oh, yeah. Well, is he there? Yeah, he's there. So, what's up with that? I thought you said he had a girlfriend? Well, yeah, he does. He does? Well what? Is he not happy with her? Um... - No, no! - Give me that ball back! William Theodore Brooks! Bryah the Beast! - Dude, she just full named you! - Dude, shut up! Now I know for a fact that you are not where you're supposed to be right now! - Baby, listen! - Not today! Not today, no! When I was talking to Kenzie, about the gossip and the what's what. She said something! - She saw you playing ball with your boys down at Trent Park. - What, no, no, no, baby! Nah! Now I know, I know you had a shift this morning. You still working, right? You still working, right? - Listen, Bry. I can... - Uh-uh! Let's go! - No, let me just talk to you for a second, I can explain. - Let's go right now! Right now, let's go! Jake. Ben. You all take care. - Now! - What is that all about? - Now! - And none of that is necessary! - No, it's all necessary! - You could've called, you could've texted! - Hey, what's up, buddy? - Hey, what's up, man? - Where is he? - He's here somewhere. Thanks. Yeah. Oh, God. Can't a man take a break around here? No need for a break if you're not working hard. - How you doing, buddy? - I'm doing okay. Yeah? How's Carol? Good, good! She's good. I tell you what. She was a beautiful bride. Yeah, she was! About time you all took that next step. Yeah. You know, I was convinced that you were gonna be speaking at my funeral before attending your own wedding! Well, these things take time. We had to make sure we were doing the right thing. Yeah, it's tough to be sure. About anything, you just... sometimes you just got to take a shot! We're planners! - We plan. - Huh. Good luck with that. You can't plan either, you know, I know that better than most. You visit her lately? I go every Sunday. Good. This week, I made a big deal about the condition of the grass right next to her. 'Cause it was looking dead and all, so I had to bring out my mean old-man self. Went off about the fact that they weren't watering around the edges. But see here's the deal. If... if you don't water right next to the stone then it all turns brown and then it spreads and it's not good. Thank you, buddy. Thank you. Yeah. Listen, I know you're a grown man, Sean. Just always remember... how important it is... what you've got. Professor McFarland? Yes, what is it? My name is Ellis and this is Harry Jarvis. We're from the Morning Chronicle. I wonder we could come in for... I am rather busy. Something's changed. Um, no. No, nothing's changed. Oh, yeah, I can see it. I've been getting to know you for a month now, Jake. You can't hide easily from me now. I'm not hiding. What are you talking about? It's not Macy. There's a new girl, isn't there? No, no. There's no new girl... Why are your walls this color? Not my decision. I was twenty-four once too, okay? And I know what it's like to be young and in love. Yeah, but you don't know what it's like to be me and in love. Okay... that's fair. But that is why you're here. And I can only help you if you are completely open and honest with me, okay? You want to tell me about her? What's her name? We've got a big group coming in! Sweet sixteen party. Gonna be a ton of little ladies celebrating their special friend. Gonna need you to suit up! Looking good! Hey. Meet our newest staff member. Hey. It's nice to meet you, Roger Rabbit! - Oh, no, I'm... - Oh! No, he's Roller Rabbit. Yeah, I'm the Roller Rabbit. No, I'm... I'm not the Roller Rabbit. I'm... I'm Jake. This is the Roller Rabbit. Um... Hey, where's your nose, Rabbit nose? Hmm? Hmm? Put it on! - It's right here. Yeah. - There you go. And then come along and get out there! - Rolling around! - It was nice to meet you, Jake. It was nice to meet you too. Oh, sweetheart! Let me introduce you to Bazel! Sucks being over here alone, man. You look like shit. Dude, I just had the most amazing day. - Really? - Yeah! Yeah, I mean... I mean, running out of gum. That's pretty awful. Right? And then having to wear this all day and talk to people. That's pretty bad, right? But you know what, I finally met her. Oh, you mean the new girl, Sherry? Yeah, yeah, I mean, she's like... - Have you met her? - Yeah. Bitchell introduced us when he was showing her around. She seems pretty cool. Pretty cool, dude! She's... She knows famous rabbits and stuff. What? Nothing. I was supposed to come in early tomorrow to give her the rolling welcome tour. Mitchell asked you to do that? Yeah! Surprised me too. I was gonna do it. Get her to fall in love with me. Make Anna jealous. But seeing as you actually like her, I think you should do it, man. Really? When was the last time you had a girlfriend? - Or even talked to a girl? - Well... That didn't work here. - Mind helping me with the rest? - Sure, dude. Where is my phone? Oh, my God. Just relax okay. I'll call you. - Jake! Jake! - Where did you last see it? Holy balls! Where is my phone! Um, I, I don't know where your phone is. I'm calling! Really? Well, it happens to all of us at some point... - No. - ...in our lives. Oh, babe. You have got to relax. I'm trying! You know how much this promotion means. I know, I know. If you're already this stressed out, a job with more responsibility is not going to make it better. No, but that paycheck is going to be huge! And those hours! Man, those hours. - Sweetie. - No more getting up early. - Erica. - No more staying up late! Babe. Babe. You are going to do great. Okay? They're going to love you. You just need to be you. - You're right. - I know I'm right! Hello, is this Ms. Rheiner? How are you doing today, Ms. Rheiner? Um, I'm doing good, thank you. Um... I'm calling today about your results from last week. Yeah. Yeah, we got it back already. Oh... Well, I regret to inform you that it came back positive. Yes. Oh, it's um... adenocarcinoma. The lungs. Ms. Rheiner, I hate to interrupt but I do have to get on with my calls for the rest of the day. Um... I'll be sending you a quick email in a few moments - asking you of how our service has been with us. - What? If you can go ahead and mark us down as five stars. Um... Anything less and it actually counts against us. I want to thank you for using CancerQuick as your diagnostic provider. Uh, if you have any other questions or concerns. You can call us 24/7, um, at our complimentary customer service hotline. Thank you so much. Uh, bye-bye. Hey, Macy. What are you doing here? Javier gave me keys. I'm just getting an early start! Getting started on what? Um... My drawings! I am just working on my drawings! Cool. Um, can you... Oh, yeah! Of course! - Thanks. - Go right ahead! Thank you! I'm just going to put my stuff up real quick. Okay. Hey! Hey! What are you doing? There's so much history in here. It's beautiful. - ] - Yeah. Yeah, it's beautiful. Hey, I don't want to get fired! Can we leave? Come on! Don't be nervous. Is that him? Yeah, that's him. Does he look the same? Uh, kind of. He's like a hundred years old now. He's bald. - Oh, my God, those shorts! - Yeah. Been around the world. He has. He's done so many things. Triathlons, skating tournaments, coaching champs. Champions of skating? National champs. Is there such a thing? Oh... Oh, yeah! Don't let anybody else hear you asking that. Especially not Luther. Oh... you look up to him. I mean, he's a respectable guy. He built a legacy from nothing. From passion. Is that what you want to do? Build a legacy? Uh, obviously, you can read. Skate shop! They have a lot of things for sale. I don't really understand. Um... Snack bar! That's where the rink rats hang out... Uh, over here we have the restrooms! We have... arcade and lockers. And way down there is where people rent their skates. Seems like a pretty magical place to work. - All the lights and everything. - Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't say magical because Brandon and Mitchell exist. - Oh, he's not that bad! - Brandon? Yeah, he's alright. - No! Mitchell! - Oh. Well, maybe once you work with him long enough you will change your mind. Um... - Come on, last part of the tour. - Oh? What is this? What are you doing? Oh, sorry! I just, um... Hey. Are you ready? - Uh, I don't think I am. - Come on. Can I tell you something? Yeah, sure. You kind of have a grandma name. - What? - Yeah, it's pretty grannyesque. It's like right behind Shirlie for top grandma name. Wait, wait, it's second in the ranking of grandma names? Yeah, number two. I'd say top five are Shirlie, Sherry, Gladys, Bertha and uh... Um, Patty? Patty? Yeah. Grandma Patty. Alright, yeah, I can see that. Maybe not top five but definitely up there. Oh, God. Hey! Hey! You're getting better! Uh, I don't know. I'm alright, um... I... I still don't really know how to turn or how to stop or how to start without somebody pushing me. But, um, yeah, I guess I'm getting better. - So... - What? - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, I... You were talking first. - Yeah. - I'm sorry, I interrupted you. No, no, it's okay. Go ahead. Um... What are you doing here? Um... I'm just chilling. - You're just chilling? - Yeah, just taking a break. Wait, I, I didn't think we were allowed to have breaks? - Oh, we can't! - Oh? Yeah, Mitchell says if he sees us taking breaks, he's going to start breaking legs. That's a little dramatic! Yeah... but... What he doesn't know is I've actually learned his routine. At exactly 7 p.m. every single day, he heats up this big nasty-looking burrito. After taking three minutes and twenty-three seconds to eat, he sits back in his chair and he rubs his belly for about ten to fifteen seconds. Ten to fifteen seconds? Yeah. I've narrowed it down to satisfaction. Mm-Hm. If he likes the burrito like a normal person like a burrito, he only rubs for ten seconds. But if the burrito that day was particularly satisfying, he rubs for up to fifteen seconds. After that, he rushes to the restroom faster than I've ever seen him move. And he's in there for about an hour. Wow! That's, um... Yeah. So, we have an hour without Mitchell every single day and you're just now telling me! It's true. Some of us are going to be going out next week. It'd be cool if you came. Going out? Yeah, I don't know I guess I just thought it would be cool to hang out, you know, outside of this place. - Yeah, yeah, okay! - Yeah? - Yeah, sure! Great! - Great! Awesome! - Well, cool. - Yeah. Yeah, oh. Yep. Yeah. No. Here's a thought. Mm? Now, you're uncomfortable getting close to people, right? Especially women. Yeah. But you live with two young and I'm... I'm guessing, attractive females. Yeah, but that's not what it sounds like. What are you talking about, man? That's like every guy's fantasy. They're not into me. So? Well, they might not be now but you live under the same roof long enough. Something's bound to happen with one of them. No, Sean. They're together. I don't, I don't... Um... They're together. - Okay. - Yeah. Well. Even better, man! Do you, uh... Do you talk to anyone as much as you talk to me? No. Why not? I don't really have anyone. Sure, you do. You got, uh... You got Ben, you got William. You got the lesbian twins. Ben and William just have me around to test their new guide before they try it. And they're not twins! They're together. They just let me live with them because it's like I don't exist. Okay, don't say that. No, no, no! That's what they say. They say, "Hey, Jake, great to have you around. We don't even know when you're here. It's like you don't exist." Why won't you talk about your family. That's not why we're here. Well, I think that if we talked about them, then... I'm here so you can make me feel like a normal person. Okay, why are you so stuck on that, huh? What? Being normal? - What? - What... Why do you even care? Are you kidding me? Why would I be here if I didn't want to feel like a normal person? I don't know, you tell me. And what is normal? I don't know what normal is! Uh... Someone who... who talks to people without feeling like they're going to fall into some sorry useless puddle that everyone wants to step on. How can everyone go out into the world and then feel like it's all okay? It's all okay! It's not okay! Why is it not okay? Because you have people on this side of the spectrum judging people on this side. And if... by God, if you're not on one side. If you're like kind of caught in the middle. You're teetering, right, back and forth. Then you're just going to live a sorry life. Look. I know you don't want to talk about your family. No, I get that. Hey, you want to change your life, don't you? That's why I'm here. Now if we don't talk about your family, we'll never get past this. It's called closure. We have to address this at some point, Jake. Jake! Stop just for a second! If we don't address this, Jake! Jake! Jake! Sorry. He'll come back. Don't stress about it. I used to get upset at the old man all the time. We turned out okay. I don't know. Never seen him this upset before. He's got a temper? I don't know, he won't talk about it. - But I know something's there. - Got to just keep digging, huh? You know, we didn't talk for weeks after the accident. James, please. We blamed each other probably as much as we blamed ourselves. No one wants to hear about this. Let me finish. Hey, you don't have to go into this. - We don't need to talk! - It was 15 years ago, dad! If you don't want to talk about it, you don't have to! I've got something to say! All she needed was a drive home. He was passed out drunk. I was hanging out with friends. It was just a regular night. She called me about four times. Texted me I don't know how many times. On the last call, I answered all irritated. I told her to call dad. And I hung up on her. Obviously, he didn't pick up. We decided that our... our plans were more important that night. And so far, it's cost us the last 15 years with her. - It's not your fault. - Yeah, I know that. And it's not yours. But that's what I'm trying to say. I mean, who knows what's going on with this kid? He's probably confused and he might be blaming himself. So, what's the issue with him? It's hard to tell. - Still trying to figure it out. - Oh, well, there you go. Easy. I'm doing the best I can with the information I have, okay? Besides, who do I have to go to when I have questions, huh? You tell me. People go to you looking for answers, not the other way around. No, no, no, no, no. Hang on a second. Who do I have to go to when I have questions, huh? Tell me! When I have things that I need to sort out, who do I have to go to? - You really wanna know? - Yeah, I really do! - Yeah? - Yeah, really! No one! That's the truth. It's just you, bud. It's just you. You know when that boy lost his mother... when I lost my wife... I didn't have anyone to go to. But the negativity stops at us! Okay? You know why? It's 'cause that's the burden of being a father. You may not actually be one but you damn sure are to that kid. Come on, dude. Hey! Jake did not tell me that we'd be in the presence of such company tonight. We're not going to help you with your guide, Ben. Don't even try, Ben. Alright, my dudes and dudettes. I've got three simple rules for you guys, alright? No running, okay, guys? The vest will turn itself off if you do that. Number two, do not hit each other, alright? I know you guys are friends, but this is not Call of Duty. Do not run around like it's Battle Royale hitting each other, okay, guys? And rule number three, just have fun, alright, guys? Where's Jake? We're getting slaughtered! Jake, let's go! Take it slow! He needs to get here. Come on, Jake! Where is he? Got us pinned down! They're murdering us, dude. Come on, Jake. Come on, dude! What? Are you kidding? Sherry? You dropped... - You dropped this. - Oh, thanks. So, you know, - if you had to describe me... - Stop talking! - ...in three vegetables... - What's up, man? Uh, not much. Hey! I've seen you. Yeah! You always come here and get the same stuff. - Shove it, Brandon! - I'm just saying. It's cool, man. Ignore him, he's an idiot. - I'm an idiot? - Yeah. - Yeah! - What makes... I know. - This guy comes in... - Stop talking! - ...three times a week and buys three packs of ramen! - Shut up! You, Sir! Would you like a well-groomed zucchini up your... Just bag the groceries. Just because I've observed the fact that this man buys three different types of shapes of zucchini, doesn't make me an idiot. In fact, it makes me the opposite of an idiot. - If anything, I'm the smartest person... - Excuse me, um... - Is there a problem here? - No! Hey, Mitchy, how are you doing? What did I tell you about calling me that? That's right! Now quit flapping your yap, start bagging your sack. Let's go! Get to work! Give it to him. Here you go, Sir. Good. Come again. See you tomorrow. - Side note... - Would you shut up and get back to work. All of you please. Thank you. Cleaned up. - Hi. I'm Alex. - Two things, kid. Don't be so eager and don't say "um." Makes you sound like an amateur. I'm sitting next to you tonight. - So, that's not going to happen. - Okay. My name's Michael. You can call me M-Dog. I've been judging since '94. - Cool. - Yeah, damn right that's cool. You got one hell of a Kung Fu grip there, kid. - Thanks. - Karate? No. I just, uh, work out. Yeah, I remember my days at the dojo. Best in class. Four years straight. That must've been a long, long time ago. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Hey, rookie. - You mind? - Um... Sure. Hey, kid. I guess they'll let anybody judge these days, huh? I guess there's only going to be one real judge here today. No offense, kid. No, it's cool. I'm just, uh, here to learn. Well, you're learning from the best derby girl this side of Lewisville. Wait a minute, are you telling me that you're Robin Regal? - The Robin Regal. - What the hell is a Robin Regal? Last time I checked. And now I am judging the local competitions that put me on the map. I'd offer you some of my liquid courage, but uh... Yeah. Let's judge! So, I was going to talk to you about dating this girl named Daphne. And she is capital D Daphne, know what I mean? Really nice looking. And I've had a great time with her. She's funny, she's smart, she's nice and the sex is pow! I mean, it is on. Then all of the sudden she starts asking for all these gifts. We're talking rings, dresses, even a car at some point. Now, we're not talking about some cheap Buick. We're talking about a really nice Mercedes. Hey, Jake. - Uh, I can come back later. - No, no, no, stay. - We're just wrapping up. - Oh, we, we are? - Oh, yeah. - Okay. Thanks, Dr. Gamsy. You did good today, Thomas. We'll see you next week? 2 o'clock? I'll be here, right. Well.... You gonna stand there all day? I thought you didn't like to be called doctor? I said you didn't have to call me doctor. I let people call me what they want. Come on in. I'm glad to see you're back. What's going on? I'm done with InterSkate. Okay. What happened? I'm not happy. You know... No matter how hard I try to make it real, it's never real. It's never been real, it's... it's always been me. Just me. Okay. Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Talk to me. What happened? Oh, shh! Shh! - Come on, go to bed. - You have a kid? Uh, yeah, I mean, he's super quiet and you won't even know he's here. - Mom, I painted you something, look! - What? Oh, God. - Hey! - Go to bed! She became a very mean person. She called me a psycho... when I'd lose my temper. There was always a different guy trying to call himself my dad. She'd invite the filthiest people into our home. And they'd treat us like garbage. She'd come home after work, late. And I'd have to help her walk because she'd be stumbling. I'd hold her hair back while she threw up in our tub. Eventually I... moved in with family and friends... bouncing from place to place. Anyway... Hey! What are you doing... right now? Nothing. Let's go get a cocktail. - I don't... - I know! It's okay. You can watch me. You enjoying that? Yes! Uh, I like it very much. Thank you. 2%? I do not know. - Circus of freaks. - You ain't lying. You know, Little Luke here was the best man at my wedding. - Oh, yeah? - Yep. That's awesome. Yeah. He's good people. So is this clown right here. I don't think I'll ever get married. Yeah? Why's that? I don't know if somebody would like me enough to stay around that long. I don't know if I'd like somebody that much either. Now, that's crazy talk. So, you're telling me that out of billions of people in this world... that you don't think there's anyone out there for you. I think a lot of people just die alone. Yeah, yeah, I get that. But... I guarantee you, nobody wanted to. But you know what happened, right? They just didn't take the... the risk that every one of us did. The risk to fall in love. I'll drink to that. - To love. - To love. Jake, you needed me? Um, yeah, just one moment. Are you really doing that on work time? Yes. I could write you up with a code four disciplinary referral, do you know that? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Jake. Jake! Actually, uh, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. Um, and I think your office would be a better place. Enter. Well... Look who learned how to knock before entering a room. You're early. Come in. What are you working on? Nothing. Just... scheduling in a new client. Cool. Cool. So... you excited for our last visit? Yeah. It's... it's bittersweet. Yeah, I guess it is. Hey! I need to ask you something before it slips my mind again, uh... what are you planning on doing with all your paintings and drawings? Um, probably just throw them out. I mean, they're just collecting dust right now. What do you think about, uh... showing them off? What? What are you doing later? Hi! You must be Jake. - Yes, hi! - I'm Carol. Nice to meet you. Sean's upstairs. Why don't you come on in and help me with dinner? Sean tells me that you're quite the artist. Um, yeah, I haven't actually showed him anything yet. It takes a real artist to do what you do. What's that? To expose yourself like that. To create something so intimate and then just share it with the world. I haven't actually shared anything yet. You haven't shown anyone? No. Mm. I know, but it's creepy, right? Like... I don't even know any of these people. That's what's beautiful. You have created this world that you can relate to. That you can get lost in. Even if it's just for a little while. And you know what? If you can do it... chances are, someone else can get lost in there with you. - That does sound kind of cool. - I know! She's good, right? Right! Seriously, though. I know someone who could set you up. I always thought Sherry had more hair than that. You made it! - Where's Carol? - She's on her way. I wanted to come early. - Thanks for coming out. - Wouldn't miss it. Yeah. This looks good. - Yeah? - Mm-Hm. Yep. So much detail, you can even see the pores on this guy's face. Ah, come on. Ah... You're good. Okay, one more. Alright. Alright. I'm proud of you, Jake. Excuse me, I have a question about one of your paintings. Sure, which? Um, which one? This one. Oh! Yeah, that one. Uh, it's me. Wow! Yeah. Yeah. That, uh... Yeah, that does look a lot like you. It does. In fact, so much that someone might say it is me. Yeah, I... Mm... Wait a minute. I remember you! - "Sherry!" Do you... - Yeah! - Uh... - Wow! Wow. Do you always paint pictures of people you don't know? I guess. Okay. Well, um... I'm Sherry. Uh, I mean, obviously. It's nice to meet you. What's your name? Uh... I'm Jake.
