[THEME MUSIC] [MUSIC PLAYING "I'M A HONKY TONK MAN"] [VOICE MAIL BEEPS] KATHY: Hi, John. I just wanted to remind you about dinner tonight. Around seven-ish? Hey, I'm glad we're not going through with the divorce. I love you. [PHONE RINGING] [VOICE MAIL BEEPS] JOHN: This is John, and here's the tone. [VOICE MAIL BEEPS] TOMPKINS: Get your ass out of bed, Bloodstone. [GROANING] Come on, dammit. Answer the phone. We got a hostage situation here. I'll be right there. Oh, my head. We're trying to gather more information, but all the details are sketchy right now. The police say that a number of hostages are being held in this building right over here. But this we do know. The bank robbers have threatened to kill one hostage every five minutes if their demands are not met. They want a helicopter. There's been no word as of yet, captain. BANK ROBBER: You got 60 seconds left, captain. POLICE OFFICER: Keep them coming. More police coming. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] Get ready. [WHIMPERING] Jenkins. Any word on that copter? No, captain. Just that it's on the way. [WHIMPERING] Waste him. [GUNSHOT] [WHIMPERING] Holy shit. Son of a bitch. Yeah. Get a kick out of that, huh? All right. All right, baby. That's one down, and we got three to go. I want that chopper. You got five minutes left. Or else another one bites the dust, huh? Jenkins, where the hell is Blood? [TIRES SCREECHING] What the hell? He's coming through now, sir. [TIRES SCREECHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] You know, you're a crazy son of a bitch. We've got exactly three and 1/2 minutes before they kill the next hostage. I want you to know you're my last resort. If I had any other option, you would not be here right now, but I have no other choice. Thank you for your vote of support, captain. Jesus Christ, John. You smell like a brewery. Hey, now, you're the one that called me in on my day off. From what we've gathered, the hostages are on the far right side of the wall. Now, I got the car you wanted. Now, I don't know exactly what you have in mind, but I sure in the hell hope it works. Me, too. BANK ROBBER: Two and 1/2 minutes, another one dies. What the hell are you doing, taking off your mask? They can identify you now. Don't you worry about it. When the chopper gets here, I'm gonna kill 'em all anyway. [GRUNTING] [GLASS SHATTERING] [GLASS SHATTERING] [WHIMPERING] Sorry about this. [GUN COCKING] [WHIMPERING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [CRASH] BANK ROBBER: Take this! [GUNS SHOOTING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [GUN SHOOTING] [SCREAMING] [SLAMMING] [GUNSHOT] JOHN: That's far enough. BANK ROBBER: All right, man. It's cool. It's cool, man. OK. OK. Come on. Come on, then. Arrest me. [GUN COCKING] What are you? What are you, crazy or something? Arrest me, please, man. Do you know how much money is in this bag? It could make you be filthy rich. If the helicopter's coming right now, we could fly out of the country. Let me show what-- let me show what's in here. We could fly out of the country. You'll get all the broads. Huh? I'd like to go away. Would you like-- would-- would that be cool? I want to-- I want to go away. So, you want to go away, do ya? Yes, I do. [GUN SHOOTING] [SCREAMING] [SLAMMING] Well, have a nice trip. Crazy son of a bitch. [CRYING] If I would have known you were going to barbecue everybody's ass, I would have just set the place on fire myself. Well, you asked me to do a job, and I did it. Yeah, I did. But why do you have to do such a big ass gun? Why can't you be like the rest of us and use your .38? Come on, Leo. You know I don't like using pea shooters. Right, right, right. Let me tell you something. This new commissioner's going to have a field day with my ass because of your-- your barbecue. As a matter of fact, he want to see us in his office right now. Jesus Christ. This is a book. A penal code book. Obviously, a publication neither one of you gentlemen is familiar with. [SLAMMING] Now, that helicopter would have been there in 30 seconds. Why couldn't you have waited? [CLEARING THROAT] Um, sir, 30 seconds more and another hostage would have been killed. Could you have handled this situation with any less extravagance, Detective Bloodstone? Sir? Well, then, let me put it in layman's terms, then. You ran over one suspect with a police vehicle and broke his spine. You burned two other suspects beyond recognition, and a fourth suspect was found with a hole in his abdomen the size of a basketball. Pike County may look like Dodge City, but you are no Marshal Dillon. You understand? Those suspects you executed had rights, all of which you violated. Now, if you gentlemen would excuse me. [FOLDER OPENING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [VOICE MAIL BEEPING] JOHN: Hi, honey. It's me. Hello, hello. Come on, Kathy. Answer the phone. Look, I-- I got help up down at the station, baby. I-- I'm sorry. I know I'm a little late, but-- but I'm on my way home right now. See you soon. [DIAL TONE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Kathy? [KNOCKING] Kathy? Come on, Kathy. Open the door. [KNOCKING] Come on, now. Open the door. Kathy? What do you want? What's all my stuff doing out on the front porch? You've been evicted. Come on, baby. I'm gonna freeze out here. [DOOR SHUTTING] [DOOR SLAMMING] Now, look. You say we could get back together. No. I said that we were gonna talk about it. John, why didn't you call? I had this nice dinner, my best dress, candlelight, and you don't show up. Look, honey, I can explain. It was police business. I got tied up on police business. If you think that you're gonna come home here, and hop into my bed, and make love to me, well, it's not going to happen, John. [LAUGHING] It's not gonna happen. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIMPERING] KATHY: It's not your fault. CRIMINAL: Drop your gun, cop, or your partner dies. JOHN: Put down the gun. -Get back! JOHN: Put it down! I'll kill him! KATHY: John! RANDY: Don't kill him! KATHY: It's not your fault, John. You're dead! Go, Jimbo! [WHIMPERING] What? [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] (WHISPERING) It's OK. It's OK. It was just another dream. [ROOSTER CROWING] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] RADIO DJ: This is KGOC, Pikeville County News at the top of the hour. It was another unsuccessful attempt today to transport crime leader Marietta Copella when two FBI agents were shot to death while bringing in Copella to stand trial in Pikeville Court. Copella has been charged with extortion, gun smuggling, and gambling. The trial is set for this Friday, and officials say they've received extensive [INAUDIBLE]. On the lighter side-- Morning, Mr. Mills. Good morning, John. Say, if this is about that house payment I'm late on, well, I was gonna mail it off today. I could give it to you right now, if you like. That won't be necessary, John. It's about the balloon payment coming up in about two weeks. The people that held your second mortgage, they discounted it. And they sold it to a big corporation back east. The holder of the second mortgage, they have told the bank that they're not going to renew the mortgage, and they're prepared to take over the first. What does that mean? It means you've got to pay them $25,000 on the day it's due, or you're gonna lose your house? How much time do we have? Well, week and a half. I'm sorry, John. I don't need your sympathy. I'll-- I'll get your money. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] What are we gonna do, John? We're behind on so many of our bills. I'll take care of it. My fault, anyway. Now, don't go blaming yourself. I just blame that job of yours. Oh, come on, now. Look what it's done to us. Look what it's done to you. It's taken and taken, never giving back a thing. They're not gonna take our house, baby. I promise. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go down to the station and talk to the credit union. Figure I'm worth $25,000. Will you be home for supper tonight? We've been given candlelight dinner one more shot. Suspended? You can't be serious. I'm afraid so, John. I'm really sorry. But it came from upstairs. A guy from the bank came by today. He told me I had to give him $25,000 or they're going to take my house. And there's only two ways I can get my hands in that kind of money, Leo. One is from the credit union, and the other way's robbing a bank. Now, if I'm on suspension, that eliminates the credit union, and I damn sure don't want to rob no bank. I argued with Internal Affairs for two hours. I told them they were wrong, but times are changing. This town is changing. [SIGHING] Now, look. Go to 'em and tell 'em I'm sorry. Tell 'em I won't do it again. Just give me one more chance. I've got a few bucks in my savings I can loan you. Thanks, but I don't take handouts. [THUDDING] Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go get some shock therapy. John. [DOOR SLAMMING] CRIMINAL: Hey, man, get off me! John, is there anything I can do to help? Yeah, you got 25 grand? I wish I did. You know, if it means anything to you, the guys and I think you're getting a pretty bum deal. Thanks, man. Say, Jenkins, have you seen my house keys? No. Sorry, John. Captain Tompkins, is Bloodstone there? Yes, sir. If it's convenient, I'd like to see the two of you in my office. [DOOR SQUEAKING] John. Come on in. It's good to see you. How are you? [INAUDIBLE]. John, this is Agent Robbins and Agent Harrington of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. How do you do? So, Mr. Bloodstone, do we call you John or, uh, Mr. Bloodstone? Well, my friends call me Blood. We'd like to be your friends, John. Have a cigar. Come on. According to your files, you have quite a reputation. Very aggressive police officer. Let's see here. What? In 1985, you made the McPherson arrest, uncovering millions of dollars' worth of heroin. In '87, solved the campus murders. '89, made the Simpson arrest. Is that where you lost your partner, John? Now, you boys didn't call me down here to talk about my file. Why don't you get to the point? Internal Affairs being a little hard on you? You familiar with the Marietta Copella trial? Yeah. We'd like you to transport Copella, and we've devised what we think is a pretty well organized plan for you to easily and safely do it. Let me explain it to you. We put you and Copella in a bulletproof limo. We have you surrounded by a police escort. You'll be in contact with headquarters at all times. We'd guarantee maximum security. Safe, simple trip. Why me? The Bureau thinks you're the right man for the job. Well, see, you're forgetting one, small, minor detail? What's that, John? That I'm on suspension. Internal Affairs is going to drop the investigation. That's right. The complaint's been withdrawn. But why should I give a damn about the FBI or Copella? Well, let's say we offer a financial reward. $10,000. You make it 25 grand, and we got a deal. OK, come on, John. Now, this is the FBI. They need your cooperation. $25,000 it is. Good. You'll leave immediately. We have a private aircraft standing by to fly you in. You'll pick up the prisoner at the city jail. I'm just going to pack a few things, and I'll be ready. There's no time. We'll provide you with what you need. Well, let me at least call my wife. No, you mustn't do that, John. It's top secret. It's very important. Any other questions? Yeah. What if this well organized plan of yours lays an egg? Impossible. Too well organized. Anything else? Yeah. These are lousy cigars. [AIRPLANE FLYING BY] AIRPORT INTERCOM: For New York, Tennessee International Airport. Jonathan Bloodstone? I am. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] I thought downtown was the other way. LIMO DRIVER: There's been a change in plans. What do you mean? We're picking up the prisoner in a different location. [TIRES SCREECHING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Where's that escort that Harrington promised? Change of plans. Bring him out. Hey! And where's my driver? Like I said, change in plans. You'll take the Ford. This is my escort? [LAUGHING] You got to be kidding. I'm not going anywhere with a guy dressed like that. You're nuts. Get another driver. I'm not going anywhere with this guy. I want a chauffeur, not a cowboy. What are you-- what are you doing? Hey! Someone did that already. MAN: We already frisked him. Hey. Links are not necessary. Take those cuffs off me! Hey! I want to see my attorney now! [GRUNTING] [CAR DOOR CLOSING] [GROANING] This is a detailed map of your route. Stay on it, and stay on time. Don't stop except at these prearranged places. Talk to no one. Don't telephone anybody. And above all, don't communicate to anyone this change of plans. Understand? Yeah. I know all about you, cowboy. Huh? Name's Bloodstone. This caper's about as secret as Jim and Tammy Bakker. You know that, don't you? The only thing I don't know is which one of us is going to die first-- you or you? [LAUGHING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [CAR ENGINE STARTING] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] So, um, you're from Hicksville, huh? Pikeville. Pikesville, Hicksville. Same thing. I tell you, I like small towns. I like towns in the country. They're really nice, you know? They're safe. You don't wanna cross those scumbags in the big city. You know what I mean? Ah, look at it out here. Clean air, blue skies, fresh water. I love it. And the girls. Those country girls are something else, again. And they're built. You do like girls, don't you? You can take the girl out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the girl. [LAUGHING] Wonderful. OK, cowboy. How much is it gonna cost? 50 grand? How's that? I'll give you 50 grand. Just pull over to a phone. Let me make one phone call, just one, and in an hour, you'll have your money. Then all you gotta do is just turn your head, and I'm outta here. [CLAPPING] What do you say, cowboy? I say, why don't you shut up? You are really stupid. Here I'm offering you 50 grand, and you say, shut the hell up. I mean, what about that accent of yours? Don't you know how to talk English? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] We got company. What? [GUN COCKING] Woohoo! All right! Hey, cowboy! Check this out! Woo! [KISSING NOISES] Check out the size of that gun! [LAUGHING] Did you see the gazebos on that girl? [LAUGHING] Oh. You were scared shitless. I can't believe what you looked like. You should have seen your face? I thought I told you to shut up. You oughta learn how to get a better grip on yourself. You're not a cowboy. You're a cowgirl. Shut up. You know, you got a big mouth. That's all you got, is a big-- [PUNCH] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] The hell are you doing here? Come on in, I've got some coffee. [GUNSHOT] [YELLING] [GUNSHOT] [YELLING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [COUGHING] Will you put that cigar out? There's only two of us in this car. You want to try to kill me before you book me? Put out the cigar. Look, if you don't put out the cigar-- Hey, look. If I put out the cigar, will you shut up? I-- I promise you, I will say absolutely nothing. Thank you. I appreciate it. I've got to go to the bathroom. I've got to go to the bathroom. What? I've got to go to the toilet. Do you want me to pull it out and show you? What are you pulling over for? What are you doing now? Well, you said you had to go to the bathroom. I am not going to go take a leak out in the middle of a desert. Oh, come on. Use the tree. Anybody can use a tree. I refuse to get out and go out there. You're being difficult now. I'm not going to do it. Pull up to the next Hilton Hotel. We'll use the men's room. Come on. Thank you. You're such a barbarian. JOHN: Would you hurry up? COPELLA: I'll use my other hand. JOHN: This is downright embarrassing. [PANTS ZIPPING] [TOILET FLUSHING] Should be smooth sailing from here on out. COPELLA: That's what they said about the Titanic, yeah. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTING] A cop. What? What's the problem, officer? License and registration, please.

JOHN: Probably another five, six hours. COPELLA: You're not going to drink and drive, are you? What are you, some good Samaritan citizen all of a sudden? No, I'm not. Keep your eye on the road. So, you drink, huh? Chasing away the devils. Woohoo. Yeah, but what would you do if some cop on your payroll started shooting at you? I ain't got no cop on my payroll. Yeah, well, what was that back there? That was not a cop on my payroll. Oh, come on, now. What, do you think I'm crazy now? Keep asking me, and I'll keep telling you, there's not a cop on my payroll. Yeah, yeah. You're like a broken record. What, I should believe you, huh? Her, uh, her name was Seraphina. She was built like a pizza parlor, heh, heh. Fun around the pizza parlor. But he wouldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't like me. And, uh, I went off to Chicago. I never saw her again until about a couple of years ago, you know. Hey, would you shut up? I thought this story would interest you. No. You like Italian food? No. I like fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans. Oh, please, don't make me sick. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] And no, there's no way I'm gonna sit and listen to country music. Could you please shut it off, please? Oh, god. (SINGING) Take me down the river in the country, no return. How can you listen to that junk? We need to get some gas. There's a gas station up here. Just stay in the car and don't make a spectacle of yourself. I need a telephone and a bathroom. Can's in the back, phone's in the office. POLICE WOMAN: Sheriff's department. Hey, Betty, let me talk to Sheriff Murray. Heya, Joe. This is Ben down at the station. You better get over here right away. I think this is the fellow you was telling me about. Hey, mister, I got something to show you here. It's your engine. What's wrong with it? She don't quite sound right. Are you changing the oil every 4,000 miles? And you could use some windshield wiper fluid. You're low. I'd just like to use your telephone now, if you don't mind. Well, you gotta let me put some No Knock in it. It's $4.95 plus tax. That's a even $5. Yes, operator. I'd like to place a collect call please to area code 213-487-78-- Hang up the phone nice and slow. That's him, ain't it, sheriff? The fellow you was telling me about. Yes, it is, Carp. You did good. OK, mister. You just put your hands on the desk, or I'm going to blow you a new asshole. See, I don't take very kindly to cop killers. Look, Sheriff. I'm a police officer. I was hired by the FBI to transport this criminal, Marietta Copella. He's right out there in the car. Yeah, and I'm Tom Cruise. If you'd just look at my back pocket, I have a piece of paper. It'll explain everything. There's a phone number on you can call. Guy's name is Harrington. He'll verify everything. Yeah. Ain't look legal. Move. [PHONE RINGING] Harrington. Yeah. This is Sheriff Joe Murray over here in Canyon Falls. I got a man named John Bloodstone. Says he works for the FBI. It's Bloodstone. Can I speak to him? Wants to talk to you. Harrington. John, what the hell's going on? Excuse me, sir, but I was about ask you the same question. Seems this well organized plan of yours ain't working out too well. What do you mean? Well, I mean I had a motorcycle cop try to blow me off the road, and now I got this sheriff with a gun stuck up my nose. All right, listen to me, John. There are a lot of people on Copella's payroll. Remember that. Now, let me speak to the sheriff. Hello. HARRINGTON: Sheriff, have you notified anyone else regarding the situation? No. The only one who knows what's going is me-- and, uh, Moses, the gas station attendant. That's good. You keep it that way. Where are you in Canyon Falls? SHERIFF MURRAY: 527 Canyon Road. All right. You stay there, and I'll have two men down there in, oh, 30, 40 minutes, all right? OK. You get two men down there fast. Got it. I can't believe this is happening to us. Look at the mess you got us into. Something ain't right. Well, what are you gonna about it? What am I gonna do about it? Yeah. What do you mean, what am I gonna do about it? Listen, you better do something about it. It's not my fault we're in this mess. Because when this is over with, I'm gonna hang your ass. I'm the one transporting you. You're not transporting me. -What are you talking about? You're transporting me? If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be in this. This is what you call transporting? This is bent over a truck. I don't know who this sheriff is, do you? [TIRES SCREECHING] Good. Here they come. Hey, I'm sure glad you guys finally made it. I was just-- [GRUNTING] Hey! You Sheriff Joe Murray? Yes, I am. I-- I'm Ben Carp. I caught these guys first. [GUNSHOT] [YELLING] [GUNSHOT] [YELLING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNS SHOOTING] [GLASS SHATTERING] Come on. Let's go. Come on. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] How nice. A convertible. Ojay's. [TIRES SQUEALING] Now we've got two more FBI agents down. Hour ago, we hear about a highway patrol officer shot to death. I've known Bloodstone for years. He's done a lot of things. But a cop killer? Copella's gotten to him. He's offered him a bundle. Come on. Bloodstone's got a financial crisis, right? How do you know about that? I've given Agent Harrington access to our computer. Even Blood has its limits. Really? How do you explain that, captain? The bullets in the dead FBI agents match Bloodstone's department issue .38. You're not going to make it, hayseed. Don't start with me, Copella. Jesus. What, do you have the whole country on your payroll? There's a trail of bodies from here to LA pointing at you. And the cops in, uh, Hicksville or Pikesville. Pike. Huh? All they're going to do is come out here and shoot us first, ask questions later. Yeah, well somebody screwed up along the chain of command. Oh. Oh, really? We've been targeted and you know it. Targeted. What are you talking about? You know, I can see why they gave you this job. You're stupid. Hey, you want me to hit you on the mouth again? No, no, no. OK, OK. Please. This is it. If I stand trial in Pikesville, I'll get a reduced sentence for mentioning names. And I got a whole slew of names to mention, from those crack house Johnny's down to the senators, congressman, even the FBI. The FBI. Come on. You gotta be kidding. You expect me to believe the FBI's dirty. Not all of the FBI. Guy like Harrington, for example. Yeah, Harrington. So, what do you say, huh? Pull over to the next phone. Let me make that phone call I keep telling you about, and I'm outta here, and so are you. 50 grand. That's what I'm gonna give you. I'm taking you in. Taking me in. You know, just as well. You wouldn't know what to do with the money if I did give it to you. Besides, it's a long trip, and every man's got a price, including you, and including me. So, drive on, hayseed. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Harrington. Morgan and Kimroy are dead. Looks like Bloodstone got away. How much of a head start have they got? Two, three, four hours max. So, we have half a dozen dead bodies and no Bloodstone or Copella. Find 'em, kill 'em. You understand? ROBBINS: Yes, sir.

There's a lot of snakes out there in them woods. Oh, shit! Oh! Ah, oh, shit. [POLICE SIRENS SOUNDING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] Easy, boy. Come on. Let's get 'em. [DOG BARKING] [PANTING] [MOANING] I'll take the girl. JOHN: Fine. I'll take the canoe. [MOANING] Hey! Hey, cuff me to her! JOHN: (WHISPERING) Shh! Quiet! [MOANING] [GUN COCKING] [GASPING] Easy, boy. Come on. [DOG BARKING] All right, guys. We know you're in there. Come on out. [DOG BARKING] COPELLA: (SINGING) Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream. JOHN: You're giving me a headache, Copella. COPELLA: I still think we should have brought the girl. JOHN: And I think you should grab one of them oars and start paddling. Come on. Grab an oar. [MUSIC PLAYING] Easy, you're gonna tip us over. COPELLA: Geez. It happened about five years ago when I was uniform. Me and my partner, we pulled over what we thought was a drunk driver. The guy was on PCP. Next thing you know, the guy grabs my partner's gun. He's got it up to his head. And, uh, well, us cops, we got codes, you know, when something like that happens. Sometimes it's our middle name, sometimes it's a nickname. Randy's name was Jimbo. When you give the code, you-- you count three beats, then you move. So, I said, go, Jimbo. He didn't move. He took my bullet. [SNIFFING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Homicide. Tompkins. JOHN: Captain. John? TOMPKINS: Where are you? What's going on? I'm about an hour away from the Pikeville line. I've been set up. I know you've had problems with your marriage and the drinking. Look, I'm bringing Copella in. I need your help. Harrington said they'd guarantee you total protection and safety. Don't say anything to them about this. They're the ones who set me up. What? John, now, listen. JOHN: No, you listen. They don't want Copella to make it to trial. Harrington's afraid that he's going to name some names in court, and one of the names might be his. Look, if you try to bring Copella in on your own, you'll be signing your own death certificate. Leo, I'm going to bring this guy in with or without your help. What's it gonna be? All right. What do you need? I need a truck from the bomb squad unit, and I need some ammo. I'll meet you at Old Hickory Landing in about an hour. Then what? Then I'm gonna drive Copella right up to the courthouse. John, you're a crazy son of a bitch, you know that? OK. Do what you want. What will you be driving? I'll be in a white Trans Am. OK. I'll meet you there in one hour. Let's go. [GROANING] I just talked to Blood. He wants to bring Copella in, drive him right up to the courthouse. I'm afraid I'm going to need your help. Leo. Kathy. What are you doing here? Have you seen John? He's in trouble, isn't he? John is always in trouble. He's probably out boozing it up. I mean big trouble. Don't bullshit me, Leo. What's going on here? John has been charged with murder. Murder? He took the Marietta Copella case, and something went wrong. Oh, come on. You don't believe it. It's not what I believe or don't believe. They got us on the case. They took a slug from one of the victims, ran a ballistics test. And it was confirmed that the slug came from John's department issue .38. He hasn't touched that gun in over four years, not since his partner go killed. I want you to go home, Kathy, and stay there until this thing blows over. But, Leo. I said, stay out of this. Do you understand? But, Leo! [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] You know, you're a crazy son of a bitch. You know that, don't you? And when this is over, I'm going to break every bone in your body. Well, you better get in line. This guy's got a lot of enemies. You got my ammo, Leo? Yeah, I got your ammo. You can go home now. I'm going with you. No, you're not. It's too dangerous. Now, you didn't tell anybody about this, right? Right? Well, the Feds don't know about it. I got the commissioner's word. It's OK. I told you not to tell nobody! Look, John, I couldn't get the truck with his help. He pulled some fat strings, and he's the only one who knows. Man, I don't know who to believe anymore. You can trust the commissioner. He's on our side. I don't know. John, don't be a fool. If you drive up to that courthouse by yourself, you'll be gunned down just like that. At least with me, you got a chance. And with the help of the commissioner behind you, it's gonna be OK. We'll just get right in, and drive up to the courthouse, and get you both into protective custody. And the commissioner said, no matter what happens, he will guarantee that you get your $25,000. Right. Come on, John. You gotta trust somebody. Hold it, Bloodstone! It's for your own good, John. Start the truck and bring it to us. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [EXPLOSION] [YELLING] [GASPS] [PHONE RINGING] Yes? It's done. Are you sure? I'm sure. We'll meet at your office. Good job well done, gentlemen. Stroke of genius, if I say so myself. And no more Copella. And no more Bloodstone. [INTERCOM BEEPING] SECRETARY: Excuse me, commissioner. You have a call on line one. I'm in a meeting. Tell them to wait. SECRETARY: He insists on talking to you. Says it's important. I'm putting your call through now, sir. Go ahead. JOHN: Hello, commissioner. Bloodstone? Where are you? JOHN: Oh, what a surprise. It's Agent Harrington. And let me guess. I bet Agent Robbins is there, too. You guys are having a party and I wasn't invited? Little plan almost worked out, but no cigar. Uh, what do you mean? JOHN: You know, the way you set me up and all. Why would we do that, John? JOHN: 'Cause you don't want Copella to stand trial. 'Cause he might say some things about the bureau's little dealings that'll incriminate you gentlemen. So, you want to make a deal? JOHN: Oh, we have a deal. The deal is I bring in Copella and get my 25 grand. Now, I sent the agreement to Washington just in case it might have slipped your mind. I'll tell you what, Bloodstone. We'll double it-- no, triple it. You name your price. You just give us Copella. What do you say? JOHN: Oh, I'm going to give you Copella, all right. I'm gonna bring him in and shove him right up your butt. Uh, look, John, where are you? I can send a car and have you both brought over to City Hall. JOHN: Oh, no need for that, commissioner. See, if you just look right over your shoulder. It's 11:55. Exactly 12:00 noon, Copella and I are gonna walk up to the courthouse steps, at which time I will turn over my prisoner, you will sign my voucher, and I'll collect my money. Come into the commissioner's office. We'll make the exchange here. You boys must think I'm making it out the ass. No. If I come up there, you're just gonna gun us both down. No, thank you. 12:00 noon, gentlemen. What are we gonna do? Well, we're not gonna play anymore games with him. I'm just gonna have some uniforms out there and just blast the hell out of him. No, no, no, no. It's exactly what he wants us to do. That way, we end up with the press, the TV, the whole damn town out there. No, way too much attention's drawn to it. We'll have too many questions to answer. No. [PHONE BEEPS] Bloodstone and Copella are in front of City Hall. I want you up on the roof. Everything is going to come down to 12:00 noon. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] What are you doing with it? Go on, take it. I thought you were gonna turn me over to Harrington. All I said was I needed $25,000. If I'm dead, my worries are over. You ready? [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] [YELLING] [GUNSHOT] [YELLING] [THUDDING] [GUNS SHOOTING] [YELLING] Freeze! Drop it, man. OK. Uh, no need to get excited. [TIRES SCREECHING] No need to get excited. It's all right. It's all right. John! Kathy, no! [GASPING] All right, drop it! Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop it! I'll kill her! I swear to God! Now, drop it! Put the gun down, Leo. Drop the gun, Leo! Now, I want a helicopter to take me to the airport and a plane to take me to Mexico! CRIMINAL: (MEMORY) Drop your gun, cop, or your partner dies! I'll kill her! I'll kill her, I swear to God! CRIMINAL: (MEMORY) I'm gonna kill him! RANDY: (MEMORY) John, I don't want to die! John! Right now! CRIMINAL: (MEMORY) I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill him! KATHY: (MEMORY) It's not your fault, John. RANDY: (MEMORY) Go, Blood! John, I don't wanna die! JOHN: (MEMORY) Go, Jimbo! KATHY: (MEMORY) It's not your fault, John. So, you wanna go to Mexico? That's right. Go, Blood. Well, have a nice trip. [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] [GASPING] [GUN SHOOTING] [PANTING] [GROANING] Are you all right? This shirt is ruined. Look at how dirty I am. Ugh. See you in court, meatball. [GROANING] So, does this mean we can get back together again? It means we can talk about it. Well, that's good enough with me. [MUSIC PLAYING] KATHY: So, does this mean we can start spending more time together at home? JOHN: It means we can talk about it. KATHY: John. JOHN: Oh, baby.
