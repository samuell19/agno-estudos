Friends, we're about to arrive. Silence of the Tomb Dear friends, we are about to reach the small island, that the big star, Annette Lamarck, was crazy enough to buy... and we have been crazy enough to come and spend the weekend with her along this romantic stony coasts, crowded with mosquitoes, far away from our caf?s and night clubs, and from civilisation. But we must be grateful for her invitation. We shot a western, that I believe will be a box office hit. Let's hope this will repay me, for the disaster of that extraordinary movie: Strangers in Kerburgen. The takings... zero. We Frenchmen, who 'discovered' cinema, have always worked in harmony with the Spaniards, who discovered America, hence we are the fathers of American cinema. I wish, that Dracula versus Sartana... looks like it was made by our children. How beautiful you are. Gorgeous! The light that called got lost, in the evening breeze, without reason. The love that was born got lost, in the sandy beach, without reason. The windows that were... open to love... were close to the wind of my pain. The beacon that shone... was conquered... by a kiss, in the evening, with love. The star I clearly saw... disappeared, in the shadow of the loveless lover. How many trips do you do? One in the morning, one in the evening, never on Sundays. Good, we'll take a trip tomorrow morning. - OK - Let's go. - How are you, Valerie? - Very well, thank you. - Hello - How are you, Pongo? How's it going? Aren't you going to ask me about your son? How is Christian? He's alright, sleeping at home. I must kill her, even though she's my sister, the beautiful... the famous Annette Lamarck. Behind that smile, there is nothing but filthiness, I hate her. Yes, I must kill her. There she is, amongst her circle. Having fun. They are going to wake up Christian, they don't care about him. I know them too well. You, Jean-Paul, you hate Weber, as well as her. I still remember, when you weren't yet a famous director. You worked enthusiastically, that's why Annette fell in love with you. But not even the birth of your son... Christian, made Annette stand by you. Why didn't you marry her? You, Vincent, why are you with them? You were a good lawyer, students went to hear you at the court... then, all of a sudden, you left everything, to become the right hand man of Weber Productions. You are in love with Annette, and jealous of everyone else. Jerome Weber, film producer. You discovered Annette Lamarck. You were crazy about her beauty, but without any faith in her acting ability. You were the first to be surprised by her success, then she left you. Her fame brought her independence. Now you resent them because she belongs to them all. And you Annette... what do you think about when you're alone? You get lost... frightened... you feel guilty. Thank you, Juan... Without you, these last months would have been unbearable. Your presence here is just another of Annette's whims. Her jewels are not that valuable... to warrant the protection of a detective, but that's the only thing I can thank my sister for. And now I'm going to Christian's room, I have a feeling he's awake. - Another dance! - I'm worn out. If you hook up with both of them... What happens next? I told you to stay away from here. Go away. - If you hook up with both of them... you fall down! I did not expect this. Let's dance. Why did you leave the party? We've been looking for you. What's the child doing up again? There we go. To bed! and now I'm taking your shoes off, eh? First this one, then the other. You're ready to sleep now. Come on. - Like this, are you cosy? - Don't leave me. Christian, stop bothering Juan. Now your prayers, then go to sleep. Dear God, please take care of me, mum, dad, Aunt Valerie, Juan and Laura, and Pirracas the cat, but tell him not to scratch. Give me a kiss. Now go to sleep. Why did you leave the party? I was worried about you. We all were. I didn't want to leave the kid alone. We spent the afternoon swimming, then target shooting. Come. What happened to her? Annette, Annette! These people make me nervous. I will never get used to them, to their amoral behaviour, selfishness, harshness. They're not that bad. Besides, you shouldn't lock yourself up here. You are too young and beautiful for that. Why don't you try to forget? I don't know what's happened to her. Annette, Annette. Trust me, Valerie... What you need is a partner. You need to fall in love. That head of yours... works too much, but it doesn't care about your happiness. Juan! Juan, come here! Annette has passed out, come here. - Come here! - Annette, Annette! What's wrong with you? - I don't know what's going on. - To her room. - What happened? - We have to give her water. - Give me a hand. - Yes, of course. Maybe some cognac? - Not sure. - What's going on? We were dancing and suddenly she fell down, and passed out. I thought it was nothing serious. But seeing her like that worries me. She'll be alright. It's nothing. Annette, that's absurd... I love the child, you know he'd have everything, but he'd be a burden for us. I will not marry you, Vincent, if Christian does not come with us. Then, my dear Vincent, you can pack your bags and go for a swim. It's not you who invited me here. You don't get it. I mean Christian is my son as well, and I want to give him a good upbringing. So he's not going with you. The reasons are clear. You wouldn't dare take him away, you know too well I would be capable of... My manners restrain me from saying it... but your former friend, Weber, knows it all too well. Calm down, I know nothing, keep me out of it. If you like children so much, just make another one, but then at your age, Durban, I'm not sure... Idiots. What a fine meeting! A woman in love with herself, two selfish old men... and an embittered man: you hate us because we know... that you are just a failed writer who lives off charity. You write the scripts for my films because we pity you. Listen to me, please. I think we have to find the best solution for Christian, but without getting heated. You all know that Annette's career is very important to me, and the child might jeopardize it. Shame on you! How do you talk about Christian's fate? It sounds like you are discussing ownership of an object. But what do you know about him? Who ever got interested in him? Answer me! No one cared about him, no one loves him like I do! No one! He's mine, do you hear? You will not take him away from me. You want to take the only thing I've got left! Valerie! Enough! You should be ashamed of yourself. Come. Come with me. Now you need to rest. They won't take away Christian! I'll kill them! Come on, don't be silly, we'll talk about it tomorrow. I'll kill them... I'll kill them... Go to bed, and think no more about it. Everything will be alright. I've noticed that you carried Annette in your arms... You liked to feel my sister's body near you. Valerie, goodnight. Hold on. Don't go! What's the matter? Why don't you answer? You find my sister so attractive as well. You want her as well. All men are the same. They only notice provocative women. How easy it is! Hasn't it occurred to you that I could be as desirable as her? Valerie, goodnight. Annette. Annette? - What do you want? - Is Christian with you? No, I see. Why? Isn't he in his bedroom? No. If you want to see the child alive again, two million pesos at the base of the big tree, on the Islet of the Black Man, before noon. At four o'clock, the child will be with you. Do not try to call the police, or the child dies. Valerie! If you want to see the child alive, leave two million pesos on the Islet of the Black Man, before noon. At four o'clock the child will be with you. Do not try to call the police, or the child dies. Let's try to track them down, maybe they're still on the island. Annette, calm down. I don't understand. Let's leave by the back door. If the kidnapper went out this way, the dog would have barked. Nobody has used the boat. Nobody knows how to drive it, except me. Only I can reach the mainland in that. If anyone has come to the island, it has to be from this spot. Nobody has come. What do you mean by that? The kidnapping has been performed by someone in this house. We can rule out... that someone arrived here by boat during the night. Yes. It's one of us. Sir. Sir, I suppose you are talking about the guests. The people who live here, miss Valerie, Pongo, and myself, the housekeeper, I guarantee we are all incapable of such a vile thing. In an hour's time the boat will arrive. I think someone will have to call the police. Jean-Paul, we must follow the instructions. I don't want anything happening to my son. Today is Saturday, banks close early. If you have decided to pay the ransom, we should go to the village as soon as possible, and withdraw money. Yes, you go, Vincent. Only you can get all that money, at such short notice. I'm coming with you. No... I'll go. I know the route, and I can go by boat. - I'll go too. - Nobody should leave the house. Certainly they are watching us. We don't know where they are. Maybe in a near islet, from where they can watch our moves. If we all leave, the kidnappers will think... we are going to call the police. I think just Valerie... and Durban should take care of this. She has been living here for three years, with Christian, and she knows the place inside out. I'm calling the central bank of Manacoa, and we'll have the money in our hands in no time. The rest of us will stay here, nobody will leave the house. But I have to leave. Nobody! Is that clear? What's wrong, madam? You frightened me. I'm sorry. I just wanted to tell you that breakfast is ready. I'm going to tell the others. She's in my way again, They're all conspiring against me, I'm just a nuisance to her, she stands me just because I look after the child, but when she gets married again, I'll take him away. and Juan will want to come with us. Come on, Valerie, we are leaving in five minute's time. Yes. Valerie, are you alright? I can't stop thinking about Christian. I was thinking there's something strange about that note from the kidnappers. Juan... while I'm out, keep an eye on the others. The kidnapper is one of them. Money is not the reason. What do you mean? Christian is a burden for many of them. Valerie. Come on'. Goodbye. I'm coming, Vincent. How come my sister bought this house, Vincent? It was my idea, I liked the peaceful location. You love her a lot, don't you? Yes, when a man of my age decides to marry a woman like Annette, it can only be a great love. Vincent, you deserve to be happy, but I doubt that anyone can be happy with Annette. What do you mean? Why? She has deceived you, like everyone else, Her naive smile, her sweet voice... But I know her best. When she'll reveal her selfishness, her malice, when she'll start dominating you like she has done with the others... - Shut up! When she'll cheat on you with the first guy... - I forbid you to speak like that. I love your sister, I trust her, don't speak like that ever again. Alright, Vincent. Forgive me. - Good morning. - Good morning, You're just in time, I was about to leave. Good morning, Manolo. One passion fruit juice please. There you are. The voice that called got lost, in the evening breeze, - No match. without reason. The love that was born got lost, in the sandy beach, without reason. The windows that were... open to your love... were close to the wind of my pain. The beacon that shone, was conquered... - Valerie. by a kiss, in the evening, with love. - Let's go, Valerie. The star I clearly saw, disappeared, - I've got the money. in the shadow of loveless... I'm sorry. Where is Annette? We don't have a clue. Have you delivered the money? Yes. And Juan? I haven't seen him for a while either, but my little friend left on the eight o'clock boat. How come they let her go? When we noticed she was gone, she was already very far. We tried to wave them back, like this, but the stupid boatman thought we were just bidding farewell. - Laura. - Can I have a drink? Hey, Pongo? Have you seen Laura? She has flown south, like the doves. Be careful... have you shut the door properly? Yes. - Have you seen Laura? - No, I haven't seen anyone. I've been locked in here, working, for hours. How beautiful is your sister. She has a very interesting face, marvelously photogenic. - Thanks Vera, I won't keep bothering you. - Watch your step. Where were you? At the pier. Gathering some timber for cooking dinner. You've been there for a long time, how long has it been since you left? But madam, you don't suspect me, do you? Laura, what's going on? Nothing. Nobody is accusing you, How would you be able to hurt a fly? Really, sir? Good afternoon, Valerie. Valerie, what's the matter? Annette and I were watching the Islet though these binoculars. You don't think I'll buy that, do you? It seems to me Annette hardly cares about Christian's fate. Valerie. Please, Valerie! Listen to me... Valerie! Valerie! Listen to me please, Valerie! - Leave me alone. - Valerie. Valerie, wake up, it's important. Come in. What do you want? Leave me alone. Get up. It's five o'clock... and Christian is not back yet. Bloody cards. Come on, calm down Annette. Calm down. I think there is not other option but to call the police. Maybe it's too early to be alarmed. Maybe the kidnapper is waiting for the cover of night, so not to be seen. We can go to the islet and see if they took the money. Yes, that's better. We can't go on with this uncertainty. I'll go. No, this time I will. But you know neither the way to the island, nor the boat. Don't worry about me, I'll protect myself What do you want from me? Why do you look at me like that? I haven't done anything, I am innocent. I'm innocent... even though I wanted to kill my sister, because she doesn't love her child. It was one of you. You'd all have had good reasons to get rid of Christian. - Even you! - You're a snake! Valerie, you have no right to accuse anyone. Let's calm down, everybody. Valerie is shocked at what's happened. She didn't mean to hurt anyone. - Snake! - Calm down! Don't cry, madam. They will leave soon, and we will be happy again. I've never been happy. I can't remember a single moment of happiness in my life. You love Christian, and he loves you. I have seen you laughing many times with him. Your laughter brightened this old house. Now everything is over. I am alone. I hate them all... my sister, all of them. I do as well. And old Pongo too. By the way, where is Pongo? I haven't seen him since yesterday. He can't stand them. Indeed, since the old man hates them as well... he hides away. You know where. Go to bed. You shouldn't stay here. It's dangerous. Thanks, Laura. Don't worry about me. Enjoy the hours you have left. They are very few. It's not possible, my sister is incapable of doing this. Don't move. And lock the door. What are you going to do, Vincent? - Where are you going? - To call the police. What are you saying? You're not going to take the boat, are you? Annette has received a death threat. Do you want me to just sit with my arms crossed? Durban, what has happened? Someone has written a terrible threat on her mirror. The kidnapper is here, among us. We have to call the police before it is too late. It's night. The path is dangerous, swampy, you'd never get through it. Don't try to stop me. Wait for the boat, tomorrow at 8 o'clock, and I'll go with you. It's not possible. I'm sorry Juan, but tomorrow is Sunday, and on Sunday there is no service. On the night of the third day of the week... the clouds covered the stars, and a cold wind awoke the evil spirits, that the warm winds had put to sleep, from the times of Xang?. That sounded close. Where can I get a torch? There are some torches in the shed. Poor Durban. Who would want to kill him? How do you know they wanted to kill him... and not one of us? The same person who has kidnapped Christian, set the explosives in the boat. I know it. Yes, it was no accident. It's one of us. Valerie. I have to tell you something very important for both of us. Maybe it's not the right time, and it would be better to wait until this nightmare is over, but... I have to tell you that I love you. I've loved you since I first saw you, a long time ago. Don't doubt anymore, about either your sister or me. I love you. Think that very soon we will leave together for ever. What has happened to me? Please, tell me about Christian. Where is Vincent? You passed out. Durban had an accident, but now you have to rest. You'll see... tomorrow we will have news about Christian. Come on, get up, come on. I'm scared, don't leave me alone. - You need to sleep, I'll watch out. - I don't want to go to my bedroom. Don't forget, if there is a murderer among us, we're in danger. What are you doing here so late? You should have already gone to bed. - Madam... - Tell me. You have not recovered yet. Besides... My bedroom scares me. I have a feeling that I can help you, and release you from danger. I have to do it. Have you read that? No madam, why? Someone has played a stupid prank. We shouldn't take any notice of it. Go and get your stuff. You can sleep with me if you want. I don't know if I should... Don't be silly, you'll do me a great favour. I'm not alright, I'm very unsettled, understand? Yes madam. Thank you. Come. Again... It's always the same. She gets in my way. I have to get my plan started, to stop her shattering my dreams. There's no other solution. I must kill her. Valerie. Valerie. Weber! Jean-Paul! Come here! There is no doubt that the murderer is in this house, and that we're dealing with a madman. If we were in a normal place, the police would have already worked it all out. I told you that spending the weekend on an isle was crazy, with that boat as the only means of communication, just twice a day, and not at all on Sundays. I think the murderer has taken this detail into account. Tomorrow we'll be completely isolated. The only thing we have left is a rowing boat that hasn't been used for months. We don't know if it's reliable. This poor girl has died instead of Annette. First the murderer kidnapped the child, then he disposed of Durban, and now he tried to kill her. However distasteful this may be, each of us should explain... what we did, when we weren't all together. I fell asleep without even putting my pyjamas on. Well, there are ladies here, I don't know if I should... Annette, I'm sorry, but you will have to explain to us why Laura was sleeping in your bed? It was her who asked me. Why? It's not normal. She was worried about me, didn't want to leave me alone. And isn't it strange that you were not in your bedroom? Excuse me, Jean-Paul... but I think... I was very unsettled, that's why I went looking for Juan. She has spent the night in Juan's room. Yes, we've been talking. Juan reassured me. We've been talking all night long about you. Now I understand everything... You have let that poor girl fall into a trap. You knew about the death threat, and you left her there, alone. Annette is incapable of such things. What could I do? Try to understand, I was so scared! I hope you can explain what you were doing in that bedroom. If you really want to know, I'll tell everybody... I can explain Valerie's behaviour. She was woken up by the sound of footsteps, she went into the corridor, and saw her sister's bedroom door half-open. When she entered, the killer was still there, and hit her before fleeing. Did you see the killer? No. Can't you even tell if it was a man or a woman? Has anyone seen Vera Steiner? Vera! Vera! Jean-Paul, all this time I've felt very lonely, but you haven't done anything to win me over again. Let's not tell ourselves lies, you weren't faithful even during the first few months. That's not true, you are the love of my life, you know that. We must leave this place and live together again. I'm scared of everyone except you. And I know you love me. Yes, I love you, that's true. I've always loved you, but it's difficult for me to believe you. Jean-Paul, do you think I could lie, now that we could die at any time? Maybe I'll regret it, but I will get you off this island. Juan! Why did you tell that story about me being in Annette's bedroom? Don't worry about that. I know you are innocent. But I wanted to kill her, Juan, that's true! I'm sure it won't happen again. Valerie, you have to trust me. Are you both crazy? Where are you going? Don't you know there's no boat service today? I have to get Annette away from here. How? With wings? Take the old rowing boat. It'll take us several hours, but we'll make it. Let's go, Jean-Paul. I can't stay here knowing the murderer is among us. I've been up all night thinking about that maybe all this is a punishment. Deep down, Valerie is right, we've been messing about too much, with things too important... to be taken lightly. If we were not the way we are, nobody would want to kill us, And the idea of the crime would not have risen in anyone's mind. I think it is all more simple than I first thought... What do you mean? If we get to the village, you will find out. Last night I found something in Vera's room. Don't you think it's crazy to reach the village on that rowing boat? - Are you going to do it? - Me? I can't row. It's Jean-Paul and Annette. - How? When? - Right now. What? Jean-Paul! Annette! Jean-Paul! Annette! Annette! Annette! Jean-Paul! Jean-Paul! Annette! Annette. Annette. Jean-Paul. Jean-Paul! Hey... Jean-Paul! Jean-Paul! In my pocket... the paper and the photograph. He's dead. A bullet close to the heart. I was looking through the window, waiting for you, and saw Jean-Paul coming, stumbling towards the door. Before I could speak to him, he collapsed on to the floor, like a rag. When I reached him, he was already dead. We are all going to die on this damned island. I'm going to my room, I'm not feeling well. When I went out in the garden, Weber was bent over Jean-Paul's body, and I think he put something in his pocket. - Do you know how to shoot? - I'm not bad. Don't go anywhere without it. How come a detective without a fire-arm? Our agency doesn't allow us to use arms. Valerie. Aren't you going to ask me about your sister? I know what's happened to her. I was in bed... when I woke up with a start. I felt free. Suddenly I realised, that all this tension I've had for so long... was gone... Then I understood... that Annette was dead. If you gentlemen keep going after my son, I will have to take extreme measures against you. J. Schneider. J. Schneider? - Weber! - What do you want? Dinner is ready. Thank you Juan, I'm coming right now. After tonight, everything will be over. We will get the boat tomorrow morning. And we will be together forever. Don't leave me for a second. That way Jerome won't be able to kill us. What will happen to Christian? He will be dead. No. If he was dead, I would have sensed it, as I sensed the death of Annette. Valerie, if you are keeping something from me, tell me before it's too late. Maybe tomorrow the mystery will be over. Maybe I could... Just what we needed. No telephone, no boat, no light. They should just give this island away, and add money on top. The electricity here is very low, sometimes it goes off for hours. In the months I've been here, it's happened half a dozen times. I'm sorry if I don't go with you, but I want to return to my room as soon as possible. Good night. It's the vultures. They're flying closer and closer to the house... attracted by the corpses. Wait here. Keep yourself on guard. If you see something suspicious in Weber... just shoot. Hold it. Juan, you are cheating on me. What's that package you have in your hand? Where did you get it from? But it's the ransom money for Christian. How come you have it? I have to get in to Vera's room. Don't go. Leave it! Juan... If I kept Jerome's death from you, it's because I was afraid that your nerves wouldn't be able to bear anything more. Try to calm down. Everything will be over soon. We must not separate for a moment. I'm worn out. I'm going to my room. Where did you say the detective agency for which you work... is based? In San Juan. For how long have you been a detective? What's all this about? You did not answer my question.. For four years. And before that, what did you do? I was a journalist. Mr. Juan Ribas, psychiatric hospital Barranca, Federal Estate. Dear son, I'm looking forward to you coming back, I hope everything is alright after being in that hospital for so long. Valerie, are you there? Drop that gun! Drop it onto the floor! Onto the floor I said! Valerie, you are wrong. I'm not a murderer. You're not a detective either! Only four months ago, you were in a psychiatric hospital, from where you clearly escaped. I should kill you, but I won't. In a few hours the boat will be here, then you'll answer for everything. You're wrong. You're wrong, Valerie. Don't move from this floor. If you try to get only one step down, I'll shoot you mercilessly. Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Durban. Weren't you dead? It was easy to blow up that boat. You were all stupid enough to believe that I was... dead. So you killed the others... All of them! All of them! You are correct. I'll kill you too. But why? Why? You're asking me? Didn't you hate them as well? Yes. I did too, for even greater reasons. I had a son, my only child. They ruined his life, that filthy riff-raff. Annette feigned love for him. They made him invest money in their business. They conned him! They wanted more, and more! He forged my signature. He stole, from me... his own father! One day he found out that Annette's love, was all just a deception... He took his own life. He wasn't brave enough, to tell me the truth. He preferred to slit his veins. Then I swore that they would all pay dearly for it. I introduced myself to them with another name, I invested in their stupid business, and I courted Annette. I... I... turned into a new victim of those jackals. They thought they could get anything from me, especially when I proposed to Annette. I talked her into buying this house. I arranged meticulously every detail, of this tragic weekend... but what about me? What did I do to you? Poor, innocent Valerie, the only decent person in this shit-hole... you'll be the propitiatory victim. You'd tell. No. No. It's your life... or mine. Valerie! Valerie! Valerie, open up! Valerie! Valerie! Valerie. Juan... you're here? Yes, but take it easy. It's over. No... Who are you? Why do you have a letter from a psychiatric hospital? That's what worried you? You suspected me. I'm a doctor, Juan Ribas, psychiatrist. Your sister was worried about your health. She thought you were very strained. That's why she hired me. Do you understand now? How? You said you were a detective... We didn't want to startle you, but I've kept an eye on you day and night, while I cured you with hypnosis. But I'm not insane! No! You're completely over your crisis. I want you to come with me and become my wife. Yes Juan, take me with you. It's dawn. The boat will be here in no time. But we can't go alone. Durban couldn't kill him... I'm not leaving without the child. But Valerie... Where can he be? Think. You do not know? Maybe it was Pongo. The old man and I, were the only ones who loved Christian. Come on, Valerie, calm down. You think that Christian is with him. Do you think that Pongo has taken him? Valerie... Answer me. Come on. Valerie... Listen to me. The child will come with us. Do you want us to go look for him? Yes, yes... He has to be with him. Yes. Valerie... Let's go... right away! My love. Then the fat man said, Where is the child? The child has disappeared! And your mother's secretary said... said... Christian has vanished, the witch must have taken him, riding her broom, on a long, long journey, to that land, where the eagles fly... - Christian. Aunt. Thank you Pongo, you have saved his life. My dear, come with me. Whenever you want, we can go. Yes, Valerie. Our appreciation to the authorities and people of Calpe and Altea (Alicante), for their cooperation in the shooting of this film.
