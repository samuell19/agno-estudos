THAT LAKE THAT BUCKY'S PA HAS GOT IS THE BEST PLACE ANYWHERE FOR SHOOTING GEESE. NOW YOU DON'T THINK OLD PA CALLOWAY HAD SOMETHING COOKING ALL ALONG? - HEY, YEAH, I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. - YES, SIR. MAYBE CRAZY OLD CAM AIN'T AS CRAZY AS WE FIGURED. I BET EVEN MONEY HE AND DELL FRASIER WERE WORKING A NICE LITTLE DEAL ON THE SIDE. - LIKE SELLING THE LAKE TO THE COMMITTEE AND MAKING THEMSELVES A NICE HEALTHY PIECE OF CHANGE? - YES, SIR. OH, I BET HE'S GONNA CASH IN ON THE GEESE, BUT LOOKS LIKE OLD PA CALLOWAY'S GONNA CASH IN FIRST. [chuckles] [groans] YOU GOT TO GET YOUR LUMPS ONCE THIS SEASON, DON'T YOU? - MAKE IT SNAPPY, WHIT. WE GOT WORK TO DO. - YEAH, YEAH. YOU'VE BEEN PRACTICING, HUH? WELL, LET'S SEE JUST HOW GOOD YOU ARE. - HE WAS LUCKY, WHIT. NOW TAKE HIM. WELL, DON'T KEEP PLAYING WITH HIM, WHIT. NOW NAIL HIM GOOD.

[geese honking] - HEY. HEY. HEY! [laughs] THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. - NOW ALL WE NEED IS SOME GEESE. - WHEN DO THEY COME IN? - OH, ANYTIME NOW-- TODAY, TOMORROW. ANYTIME. - YOU LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS PROPERTY, DOUG? - VERY PROMISING, IF YOU CAN BUY IT AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND IF MR. FRASER IS CORRECT ABOUT GOOSE HUNTING BEING SUCH AN ATTRACTION. - IF. YEAH, A LOT OF IFS IN THIS SCHEME. - OH, IT'LL PAY OFF, MR. FLETCHER. I GUARANTEE IT. THIS IS GONNA BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST RESORT AREAS IN THE EAST. - WHAT IF THE BIRDS DON'T COME DOWN, FRASER? - OH. [chuckles] THEY'RE GONNA COME DOWN. I'M SURE OF THAT. - YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE. - EH? - ALL DEPENDS ON SOME BACKWARDS CHARACTER AND A PATCH OF CORN. - OH, THEY'RE GONNA-- [geese honking sounds play] HELLO THERE, MR. CALLOWAY. SAY, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT COMING OVER TO TALK TO YOU. MR. FLETCHER, THIS IS MR. CAMERON CALLOWAY, THE MAN THAT KNOWS ABOUT THE GEESE. - WELL, MR. CALLOWAY, I'VE BEEN ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU EVER SINCE MR. FRASER TOLD ME ABOUT YOU. [goose sounds stop] - YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME, MR. FRASER? - WELL, I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU. - WHAT DO YOU GOT TO SAY TO ME, MR. FRASER, AFTER FILLING ME UP WITH YOUR LIES? TELLING ME ABOUT HOW YOU WAS ALL FOR PROTECTING THE BIRDS. - HE IS. WE ALL ARE. A LITTLE THINNING OF THE FLOCKS EVERY YEAR KEEPS THEM IN BALANCE. - THINNING? WHAT, WITH THEM FANCY PUMP GUNS AND CONTRAPTIONS LIKE THAT? WITH YOUR KIND OF THINNING, THERE WOULDN'T BE A GOOSE LEFT BETWEEN HERE AND CANADA IN TWO SEASONS. - WELL, LET'S CALM DOWN. HERE, HAVE A DRINK. LET'S LOOK AT THIS THING FROM OUR ANGLE. - WELL, I KNOW WHAT YOUR ANGLE IS. MONEY, AIN'T IT? MONEY. FIRST AND LAST. HUNTERS' PARADISE. GET THE LAND CHEAP AND SELL IT HIGH. WELL, NOW SUPPOSING YOUR WHOLE SCHEME GOT BLOWED SKY HIGH? SUPPOSING THEM GEESE DON'T COME DOWN. - WELL, NOW, UH... [chuckles] LISTEN HERE, MR. CALLOWAY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S GONNA BE PLENTY IN THIS THING FOR YOU TOO, HUH? YOU KNOW? - THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH YOUR KIND. THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO. - NOW WAIT A MINUTE. - THE GEESE AIN'T COMING DOWN THIS YEAR, MR. FRASER. NOT THIS YEAR, THEY AIN'T. - CALLOWAY. YOU OWE ME $200. - WELL, YOU'LL GET PAID BACK EVERY CENT, MR. BUSINESSMAN. AND YOU ADD THAT TO MY BILL. [dramatic music] * - BUCKY, THE CORN! - PA! PA, WE WORKED SO HARD. - LEAVE IT BE, SON. THE FLAMES OF HELL ARE CONFOUNDING THE WAYS OF THE WICKED. - CAM! CAM, WAIT! CAM, DON'T! CAM! - PUT DOWN YOUR BUCKET NOW, LIDDY. - CAM! CAM, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, BUT THINK, THIS AIN'T THE WAY. CAM. - JUDGE NOT THAT YOU BE NOT JUDGED. - LEAVE HIM BE, BUCKY. IT'S NO USE NOW. - MODERATOR, ALF SIMES IS JUST TALKING GENERALITIES. HE'S NOT SAID ONE WORD SPECIFIC TO THE ISSUE. - I HAVEN'T? - NO, YOU HAVEN'T. - WELL, IF YOU WILL LISTEN INSTEAD OF-- [overlapping shouting] [gavel banging] - LET'S CONDUCT THIS MEETING IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER. NOW DOANE, YOU SIT DOWN. ALF STILL HAS THE FLOOR. - ALL RIGHT, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. YOU FOLKS ARE HINDSIGHTED JUST LIKE YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN. ALL YOU WANT IS THE HUNTERS TO COME IN HERE AND DROP A LITTLE MONEY IN THE CASH REGISTER. NEVER MIND WHAT IT DOES TO THE TOWN. NEVER MIND THAT THE LAKEFRONT LOOKS LIKE A-- LIKE A BIG HOT DOG STAND. MONEY IS ALL THAT COUNTS. NOW WE'RE ASKING OUR GOVERNMENT TO TURN OUR TOWNSHIP INTO A SANCTUARY FOR THE GEESE. NOW MOST OF YOU HERE HAVE GOT A PIECE OR TWO OF GOOD MARSHLAND THAT WE COULD SELL TO THE GOVERNMENT AT A FAIR PRICE. BUT THAT'LL BE DEPRIVING MR. DELL FRASER AND HIS BOSS AT BILLINGTON. 'CAUSE ONCE THE GOVERNMENT GETS THE LAND, THEN THEY COULDN'T BUY IT AND CASH IN ON IT. - MR. MODERATOR. POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE. - MR. FRASER. - YOU KNOW, ALF IS RIGHT. YOU SELL YOUR PROPERTY TO THE GOVERNMENT, YOU'RE GONNA GET ONE PRICE FOR IT AND THAT'S THAT. OUR WAY THE MONEY KEEPS ROLLING IN YEAR AFTER YEAR. YOU FOLKS WANT TO STAY PUT IN YOUR HORSE AND BUGGY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. ONLY OUR DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE SEES SOMETHING BETTER FOR SWIFTWATER. NOW OUR PLAN-- - NOW JUST A MINUTE, DELL. WAIT DO YOU MEAN THE MONEY KEEPS ROLLING IN? - I WAS JUST COMING TO THAT. NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA GIVE TO EACH AND EVERY ONE IN THIS TOWN--GIVE MIND YOU-- TEN SHARES OF STOCK. TEN FULL SHARES OF PROGRESS. - PROGRESS? WHICH WAY? - FORWARD WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE. - I SAW THE WAY YOU LOOKED-- [overlapping shouting] - I STILL GOT THE FLOOR! - YOU'VE HAD THE FLOOR FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF AND HAVEN'T DONE A THING WITH IT. GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE A CHANCE. [overlapping shouting] [geese honking] [gunshots] - THE VILLAGE DIDN'T WASTE MUCH TIME. THEY'RE ALREADY SHOOTING OVER SWIFTWATER LAKE. - IF YOU WANT TO FIND YOUR PA, THAT'S MOST LIKELY WHERE HE'LL BE. [gunshots continue] - [laughing] - OH, THIS IS WONDERFUL. - [laughs] - STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT! - WAIT A MINUTE. YOU CRAZY OR SOMETHING? - HEY, HEY, WHAT'S THE IDEA? [gunshot] - PA! - NO. - IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. - PA! - YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED, PHIL. - PA! - HE GRABBED THE GUN. - HE'S HURT BAD. - IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. - HELP ME! - GIVE A HAND HERE. LET'S GET HIM TO THE CAR. EASY. [bird cawing] - NOW YOU BE STILL, YOU HEAR? - HE'S ALL RIGHT, BUCKY. LEAVE HIM BE. IT'S ALL RIGHT IF YOU FOLKS GO ALONG. YOU HAVEN'T HAD YOUR SUPPER YET. - THAT'S ALL RIGHT, LIDDY, WE'D JUST AS SOON STAY HERE. - GO AHEAD, MAMA, I'LL STAY. - LIDDY, ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO? - NO. - COME ALONG THEN, SARAH. ALF SIMES HAS CALLED ANOTHER MEETING FOR TONIGHT, AND I WANT TO BE THERE. - EVERYTHING FOR THOSE GEESE. EVERYTHING. - TAIN'T FAIR. WE HEARD EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT TO SAY LAST NIGHT, ALF SIMES. WE GOT A RIGHT TO SELL OUR PROPERTY IF WE WANT TO. - YES, YOU HAVE. AND CAM CALLOWAY'D BE THE FIRST MAN TO SAY SO. CAM WAS ALWAYS ONE FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. I WAS WALKING IN THE WOODS WITH CAM ONE TIME. THERE WAS A BIG SNAKE SUNNING HIMSELF ON A ROCK. I WANTED TO GET A STICK AND KILL IT, BUT CAM SAID NO. THAT SNAKE WAS PART OF THE SCHEME OF THINGS IN THE WOODS AND HAD AS MUCH RIGHT TO BE THERE AS ME AND HIM. CAM KNEW A LOT ABOUT RIGHTS. EVEN YOURS, DOANE SHATTUCK. WELL, WHAT DOES A MAN HAVE TO DO, GET HIMSELF KILLED TO SHOW THIS TOWN WHICH WAY TO GO? I GUESS MAYBE HE DOES. HOW MUCH MORE TIME I GOT, MR. MODERATOR? - ONE MORE MINUTE, AL. - WELL, I GUESS I'VE SAID ALL I COULD ABOUT THE PETITION. NOW IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU FOLKS, WE'LL JUST GIVE THIS NEXT MINUTE TO CAM CALLOWAY, NOT DISCUSSING, NOT VOTING. THOSE OF YOU THAT'S GOT A MIND TO PRAY CAN DO A LITTLE PRAYING. THE REST OF YOU CAN DO A LITTLE THINKING ABOUT CAM CALLOWAY. [dog whimpering] - I'LL BE BACK AT 8:00. YOUR MA KNOWS WHAT TO DO TILL THEN. - DOC? - I CAN'T TELL YOU ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, BUCKY. YOUR PA'S TOUGH, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF SHOT IN A 10 GAUGE. HE MOVED A COUPLE OF TIMES. SEEMS LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO COME BACK FROM A LONG WAYS OFF AND START FIGHTING. WISH I COULD TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE. HE'S GOT INDIAN BLOOD IN HIM NOW. THAT OUGHTA COUNT FOR SOMETHING. [geese honking] [geese honking outside] - CAM. CAM. CAM. [sobbing] [dog whimpering] - TAKE IT EASY NOW. QUIT YOUR-- - [sobbing] - DIDN'T I TELL YOU I'D NEVER LEAVE YOU, HUH? [dog barks] - [sobbing] - YOUR MA'S HAVING ONE OF HER HAPPY CRIES. HEAR THEM GEESE, SON? - I SURE DO, PA. - GO ON OUT THERE AND SEE HOW IT'S WORKING. SEE IF THEY'RE GETTING ANY CORN. - HE HEARD THE GEESE. HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. ALF, HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. - MORNING, CAM. - MORNING, ALF. - IT WORKED, PA! THEY'RE COMING IN. - TOWN MEETING LASTED ALL NIGHT. IT'S DECIDED. EVERYBODY, IT WAS UNANIMOUS. THERE IT IS. PETITION FOR NEW SANCTUARY. - DOANE SHATTUCK. - I WORE HIM DOWN. - [chuckles] THANKS, ALF. - WELL, I'LL FIX US SOME HOT COFFEE. [geese honking] - LISTEN TO THAT, ALF. SURE A POWERFUL PIECE OF MUSIC, ISN'T IT? [upbeat orchestral music] *
