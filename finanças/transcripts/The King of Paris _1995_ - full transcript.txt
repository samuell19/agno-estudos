THE KING OF PARIS Derval, a word. As a long-standing member of the Société des Auteurs, I think it's scandalous to stop a successful play. Your plays stop by themselves. Coste, what a face! The face of a man who, over 217 performances, has seen his work deliberately twisted, mutilated, a victim of every variation and whim. Don't exaggerate! I added the music, I'm your Stradivarius. The bridge scene was completely absurd. I tried to reduce it, it was too long. - Try it next time. - There'll be no next time. I'll see you at dinner. Dear friends and colleagues, this is the last one. Here we go. Once again, we are once more orphans, deprived of the great lines a young writer had given us. You see, he's being nice to you. I would like to express my gratitude. First Betty, who has incarnated grace and youth for a quarter of a century. And Champmartin, by holding back so well, you make your memory lapses look good. And Raymonde, the humble, the lowly, you will put our costumes away in the basket. But you'll bring them out again, for some more magic. I'm not out of a job yet. A drink to you, and those dear to you. Remember the bone for my little girl. As always. You know what? Don't laugh. I'd like to come back to your place. Darling, we've had some great times. Such lust. I haven't forgotten. But it would be a shame to ruin those memories by repeating it. OK. I know the speech. Curtain. It's a damp squib. French cuisine should be treated with more respect. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome France. Minister, sir, you came. The Republic pays homage to the King of Paris. Where would we be without Victor Derval? Sorry I'm late, there was a debate. The President told me yesterday your cross is on its way. If you think an entertainer such as me is worthy. And to think that some grumpy monarchists consider you sectarian. Did you hear, Marquis? - Castellac. - The last of a breed. He survived the guillotine. Thank you. Thank you. Bravo! Ladies and gentlemen. Please excuse the interruption. I didn't see your play, but I hear it was a success. It caused laughter, tears and discussion. But what's happening? I see nothing but a white stage. Your theatre has disappeared between the words. Your old idols have fallen into an ambush. Drab words abolished. The obscenity of feelings abolished. The language police executed. Watch emerge from the earth the sublime organic disorder. Hear the sighs, the growls, the yapping of a new art. There's a new writer for the great man. Mr Derval. Yes? Excuse me. This may not be the right time, but... I wanted to say how much I admire you. - I saw La Spirale 7 times. - Ah! It's a good play. Yes, but you're the person who brings it to life. Thank you. What are you doing here at this time of night? I know your routine. After the show, the restaurant. Then, the cabaret. And then you usually walk home. You've been tailing me. This is the last time, so I thought: "It's now or never." When you see a play 7 times, there are no surprises. You know what's coming. Not with you. Tonight, for example. The bridge scene. It seemed shorter. Like you wanted to finish it. Ah! You noticed that? I could be wrong. You don't see much from the 3rd balcony. You should have come to see me before. I could have given you a box for your fidelity. Goodnight, miss. Wait! I want to tell you how much I owe you. I saw you perform once, in my country. And I understood what it meant to be an actor. I was 15, and my love of theatre started there. You're an actress. You were France, Paris. It was the centre of the world. You still think that? I have to. It's a lovely story, miss. Ah! The miracles of Paris. Here. I'd like a large bouquet for the girl selling matches. Here you are. Here. You're very pretty. I hope you're loved. Take my card and go to the Joinville studio. They should find you work. It might help. Thank you. My name is Lisa. That's not the one he has. The English stuff is gone. He can have marmalade. It's all the same anyway. Roll on Sunday! - Sir is already up? - I'll take it. - But sir... - I can do it. Oh! It's heavy. - Well? - Sacha wants you to call. Ah, Sacha! I read the brochure. If he thinks I'll play the role of a cuckold who isn't even in the 2nd act, he's wrong. Oh, dear Grognard! I feel all over the place today. I'm not on stage tonight. I feel like an abyss is opening in front of me. You wouldn't understand. - Meet me in my room. - I'll look at the mail. Wake up! Oh! You don't look so great this morning. Performing in public is exhausting, isn't it? It's a profession, you know. Was I a flop? You might as well go all the way. What should I have done, then? - Sat down and ordered oysters? - Wrong time of year. You know, Paul. I read your article on circus freaks. Ah! The style is good. - But... - Yes? Can I be honest? You can try. You could say things in a more simple way. I don't understand your revolutionary poetry, all those mixed-up words. - Too ignorant, no doubt. - Never mind. If you were less obscure, I've a friend at the Petit Parisien, I could introduce you. - No, thanks. You'd travel. Reporting on the airmail service would be fun. I said no! Fine. You don't want to make use of my contacts. I need money. - Again! - Yes. Always. It's funny how you're less generous at home. You get fed and housed... Fathers are responsible for their children. Even you. Sons have duties too. To themselves at least. Dad. I wanted to say... What? I'm sorry about last night. The dinner jacket suited you. Get dressed. Set B, filming in 10 minutes. We're not questioning your talent. The sound wasn't good enough. - I spoke too quietly? - It's the equipment. Derval does not repeat a scene. I won't say your mediocre lines again. I won't be hostage to your machinery. Teach the machine to speak, or put up with these crude pantomimes. Idiots! They're savages, Victor. Talking cinema will never work. With all your money, you don't need to do this. Oh, be quiet! I'm just telling you. I'm thinking of your audience. - Go and get me a Cognac. - Yes, yes. Clef de sol, what a title! Extras, that's all for today. Move over! Hello. What do you want? - Don't you recognise me? - No! Ah, yes! Yes. The little girl selling matches. - Mr Derval. - Talk to me tomorrow. That's it for today. Are you still there? Still hanging around! I don't want to bother you. I know. You're all alone in the city, you don't know anyone, you want to get into theatre, but not via the casting couch. I've heard it all before. I'll help you one more time. But that's it. Here! You're horrible, Derval. Pardon? I hate people who humiliate others. You're badly brought up. You have to be able to leave the role. Your music teacher is ridiculous! Who was that? Victor, I've got your contract... - Stop her, quickly! - Who? The girl who just left! You were in a white suit and you said: "A woman's bed is a battle field!" An excellent line. Mr Derval, there are some people who... I don't just come here for your beef. It's because I'm left in peace. It's funny, I didn't have a vocation. My parents were of modest means. I could have ended up a shopkeeper. What saved me was my fear of boredom. One day, I went off with a group of actors. I could have worked in the markets. - It's chance. - No such thing. It was wretched. I didn't have the looks for a leading man. I played spear carriers, servants, old men, chaperones. Then there was the war. And it all stopped. No. It all started when performing for the troops. One night, I was playing a soldier who'd missed his train. And I heard them laugh. It's great to get laughs from people who may die the next day. Then there was vaudeville, comedy. And now I'm plunged into Mr Coste's deadly world. You never thought of doing repertory roles? No. I do what I can do. Sometimes, I dream the auditorium is empty and wake up in a sweat. And you really want to do theatre? Goodbye. Will I see you again? I won't ask you in... No. Don't ask me. PRINTING PAINTING - GLAZING You pose? I have to earn my living. Do these artists respect you? Sorry. It's late. I'll go. You know... I very much enjoyed our evening. Cut! - Places, everyone. - See you later. Look at the state of you! That was quite a storm. What are you doing in enemy territory? Yes, I know! The monstrous invention that is talking pictures. What can I do? They're taking over. Maybe your lovely theatre will be transformed into a cinema and you can sell chocolates in the interval. - Thanks. Have your read Comedia? - No. Coste wants to break his contract. The heathen! He has to give us his next play. He's gone to the Société des Auteurs. Let him go to hell! Let him go back to his lab. Imbecile! His constipated public. He was seen having lunch yesterday with Harry Borre. How dare he? Judas! Who are you hiding? I'm protecting us. I want to have you near me. Near you? You can help me live. Some opportunities are not to be missed. It's fate. Isn't this going a bit fast? My house is taking on water. I need someone like you, to put it in order. Order? What do you mean? Let me explain. I'm not looking for a secretary, but someone in the house who protects me, helps me deal with my obsessions. Exactly. That's what a secretary does. No, not at all. It's more than that. A colleague. We'll work together. You can help me with my lines. I trust you to bring a fresh approach to what I do. The theatre, Lisa. You'll be at the heart of things. Close to an actor. You're not saying anything. Have I offended you? No. It's kind of you. Say yes, then. If I accept this job, nothing more will happen between us. I want you to know that. You'll deal with the invitations. Mr Derval won't go unless he's the centre of attraction. He's very demanding. Forgive me, but you're not French. When writing letters... I'll ask you to check my imperfect subjunctives. Careful there! It's this way. Careful! Don't slacken! Put it in the bedroom on the first floor. What are you doing in this mausoleum? Is that loaded? Don't worry, it's a prop. Everything here is a prop. - Tell me. - Yes? Is this the scenery from La Spirale? Salvage. Derval loves performing. So he keeps it all. And what's your role? Has no-one told you? You get a salary. Yes. Are you worried about your pocket money? Why are you looking at me? It could be worse. A frustrated old maid. With grey hair. May I come through? - Going upstairs? - Yes. Me too. Do you like your room? Isn't it gloomy? It faces north. Ask for a radiator for winter. If I'm still here. You're up early. Good morning, miss. Good morning, Mr Derval. I see you've met. That's good. - Your bath is ready, sir. - Coming. The house seems all sunny, don't you think? Sending an official letter, to me, Derval, to cancel our agreement! And such jargon, Coste! It's unworthy of your talent! Have I told you how much I owe you? No, you've told me how much I owe to you! It's the same thing. We're arguing like an old couple! - Here's my offer. - What? You'll become humble, and say the lines I give you? I'm offering you long-term security. You're responsible for your father as I am for my son. Very moving. You'd deny your father a golden old age? Come on! Let's rip up this rubbish agreement. - I haven't agreed. - Come on! I'm being nice to you. And I'm being careful! Read the new contract. Miss! This is my secretary. The contract, please. Contract, contract! Right, read it! Ah! You went straight to the royalties. 15%! Gosh. There must be a mistake. - What does Pastorini say? - He's furious. I made him fork out. The cheque. No. For Mr Coste. That's what he diddled you out of for La Spirale. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! He's nothing without us. We have to stick together. You haven't read my new play. I trust you implicitly. Well, all the same. What's the title? I was thinking of... The Lost Girl. Brilliant! You asked for it. How much longer must we listen to this Negro music? - Until you get to like it. - Miss, you have work to do. His heart's in the right place. Don't forget the signed photos. Do you sign Derval's photos? - Yes. - You'll have the chequebook next. I must be off. I don't want to lose my job. Yes, we don't want you getting sacked. Hold on. You should read something other than invitations. Have you read this? No. I'll lend it to you. But be careful, miss. Danger! It's quite some book. I'm not scared. No, no. I'm just passing. As usual. Put it in the car, Émile. Hello, miss. Are you the secretary? Yes. Hello, madam. Ravishing. Tell Mr Derval I've emptied my wardrobe. When you get presents, why leave them behind? My astrakhan! Throw it away. It's moth-ridden. And good luck. The rillettes are great! My sister sends them, from Sarthe. - Glass of red, Marquis? - Yes. Good colour. I don't trust that girl. She hangs around him. It's their age. Who do you mean? Mr Paul and... Paul, Paul. That's him all right. Good evening. Ah! Has Paul given you some bedtime reading? I never got beyond page 10. Poetry means rhymes to you. Are you happy here? - I thought I'd made things clear. - Yes, you had. But what can I do? I don't believe in resolutions. They never last. It's alarming. When you have no morals, you still have desires. But no feelings. It doesn't matter. It's not our fault you're beautiful and I'm no longer young. You can stay. I've made you eggs in red-wine sauce. You like those. Tuck in, tuck in. Ah! Confound it! I'd forgotten I promised to attend an annual meeting tonight. Sorry, children. You'll be fine without me. There! Victor Derval has just given us one of his hackneyed performances. - What do you mean? - He has no meeting. He wanted to leave us alone. Like an old madam. You talk as if you hate him. Talk, talk, talk. He gawks at her like an idiot. It's better than going out and getting drunk. He's telling her about his childhood. Poor boy! He doesn't deserve sympathy. Know what he called me? A youthful mistake. He never loved your mother? He's never loved anyone. He'd turn up once a year. He sent money, useless presents at Christmas. He was a stranger to me. A famous stranger. He's still a stranger to me. I could kill him sometimes. And then I look at him. And I want to applaud. What if you decided not to be unhappy? I'm not unhappy. Who are you, Lisa? What did you do before you arrived here, dressed as a well-behaved lady? And why are you here? Don't tell me you enjoy doing the filing. You want to get into theatre. Yes? - I am ambitious. - You're sleeping with my father. Thank you. I believe you. "By locking me up alone here, did you think you'd steal..." - It's not steal, it's...? - Take away. I haven't done this thing for years. I should never have agreed to go to Cabourg. Let's do it again. She waves the key at him. "By locking me up alone here, "did you think you'd take away Crébillon's pen? "Look at this place. "It evokes the hunt. The woman is the prey. "Whatever happens..." Now you read her lines. "But when a man is caught in the net, "the woman is Diana and catches him. "Playing with her prey, "she has her own weapons. "Veiled confessions, smiles, tears." You've learnt it by heart. And you're playing the role. No. Don't answer. Leave it. It's my job to answer it. Yes. - Hello? - Victor, your kid is drinking. Champagne for my friends. Impostor! The owner of this place is an impostor. You swine! You bastard! You devil! - Where's Paul? - Over there. With a bunch of losers. I'm not helping, he called me an arse. I'm tired of it. I'll get you! You pig! Paul! Get off me! Who's she? I've come to get you. Quiet! You're not cross? You're an angel. You're an angel. - Not too heavy, is he? - No. No. Thank you. I couldn't go... I know you couldn't go in. He looks happy with you. Peaceful. It's lovely. It is lovely! There's one thing I don't understand. This craze for sea bathing. As if it's a cure for the troubled of mind. I'm going swimming. Coming? - No. - No. He's like me. He's a night bird. Ah! Antinéa emerges from the sands. - Hello, Victor. - Hello, Betty. Do you know Felix Roquépine? He has a column in the Saison. Delighted. I'm looking forward to your performance tonight. You're very kind. My son Paul, miss Lisa. Mr Roquépine. Lovely couple. Are they engaged? "Engaged." What a detestable bourgeois word! My son is a Bolshevik. It happens to the best of families. It's touching the way you look at that girl. You like her. She might not be free. She's all alone. We're all she has. Why don't you marry her? She would stop you from wasting your nights partying. What are you scared of? Being happy? I'll take a photo. Put your hat on. You look great like that. I agree. It's freezing, it's great! Both of you. Read this rubbish. I don't have my glasses. "Victor Derval was a triumph last night at the Cabourg casino. "An impromptu performance matched by Betty Favart." So far so good. "But the actor has also been seen "closely chaperoning a couple composed of his son, "a hack who aspires to obscurity, "and a foreign-sounding young lady. "There's talk of a wedding. "But will the father or the son be the groom?" Yes. Quite. Why are you looking at me like that? There's nothing going on. I'll smash his face in. I forbid you. No violence. I'll handle it. I'll run him through. The article had been shortened. I don't know. Well? All ready? Gentlemen, we'll stop at the first blood. Get ready. Ah! I've been hit. I've been hit. Ah, I've been hit! Thank you. - Blood has flowed. - Good! It's a farce. Against all the rules! Poor Roquépine. He fences as well as he writes, the coward. Now we're equal. You're doing your job. But perhaps you could publish a correction, tomorrow morning. Now, how about having an English breakfast? With fried eggs. No? Grilled sausages. Lovely rashers of bacon. No, no. I can see that's not on. Let's go! Why leave Cabourg in such a rush? Is it because of the article? - Ah! You've seen it? - Yes. What did you think? Nothing. I'm not bothered. It's a rag. - Did you decide to leave? - Yes. No. Yes and no. He lent you the car. No. I stole it, and you. Look at the road. Or we won't get very far. And no-one will know why you kidnapped me. Why have you kidnapped me? Here. Come on! Open up! Help! Open up for some poor travellers. Oh, no! Not behind the bar. Go on! Madam. The army! What's left of it. Know what we call the army in France? What? Know what we call the army in France? - No. - The silent army! Your room is this way. Here. Goodnight. Goodnight. I got the wrong room. There's a naked man on the bed. - Lisa. - We mustn't. We must never lie to each other. Lisa. He's been going for 2 hours. Do you think they'll ask us? Do they come looking in your oven? What's the new play about? People sleeping around. In Act II, there's this sex scene. I'd cut it. "Jean is alone, he looks around him "with a snigger. "He picks up his suitcase and leaves "as the curtain slowly descends. The end." It's not bad at all. It's harsh, very dark. It's really great. But there is one thing. Oh? The dressing gown, do I have to wear it for a whole act? The woman is distraught. She neglects her appearance. - What about the dress from Act I? - Yes, given the cost. We should use that dress. Right. Castellac? I'll go with you, Victor. How shall I put it? You're like a pyrotechnician who sets up a time bomb which we anticipate for three acts and at the end, nothing. Nothing explodes. You give us a successful man, I've done that role. But never mind. A man who achieves things. And then his life goes wrong. His wife cheats on him, his son is a bastard, his colleagues try to blame him for an anaesthetic incident. All that is good. It's vicious. But... But this man carries a secret. Exactly. This lost girl, the child he has never recognised, why don't you show her? She's lost, yes. Is she lost backstage? I wanted to make her absence a dramatic element. Oh, Coste! It's very abstract. I want to see the face of this girl who I've been hearing about for 3 acts. I want to see her. Don't make that face, Pastorini. We're rambling. Am I not right? You have put your finger on it... I don't agree. The relationship is with his wife. And you'll make her howl like a wolf. Think carefully, Derval. Here he goes. It's incredible how you always think you're persecuted. - I bring you something new... - New? It's L'Arlésienne, only without Daudet's talent. - I hate you! - I feel sorry for you, Coste. - You're just a... - Show-off! And what are you? - Friends, friends. - A scribbler? Good riddance to him! There are other writers... - Farewell! - Goodbye, Mr Coste. Wait. - What do you want? - To give you this. It's pouring down. What just happened counts for nothing. No. It's over. - Did he send you? - Certainly not. I said nothing about your play. Your opinion is of no interest to me. I'll give it to you anyway. You touched me. It contains the best scenes you've ever written. It's like reading your private diary. It could be a wonderful play. What do you know of the theatre? I love it. Thank you, miss. Goodbye, Mr Coste. Lisa. What did you say to Shakespeare? The reading didn't go well. Let them work it out. - Finished your article? - You come to me tonight. I'm tired of crossing the hall. - So am I. - I looked at an apartment. - What? - It's expensive. I don't want to ask Derval. What about your garret? - You couldn't live there. - Lisa, help! It's unbearable, all those old men are against me. It's time for youth to be heard. Well done, Coste. Your pen flew like a magic wand. You've unleashed your emotions as a diviner would a wellspring. - Thank you. - Ah! The scene in the gin joint in Act III. Audacious! That'll really show them. And the girl. What a character! You see? I was right. Bringing her to life changes everything. Of course. It changes everything. Now, to make the lost girl credible, we need a totally new face. The lamp, there. Not too high. Yesterday... That was yesterday. There, I tell you. I wrote "a blue light". Sorry but I see it as red, Coste. We're using your words down to the syllable. So let it go, will you? On we go. Are you Jacqueline? Perhaps. And you're a man who turns up late. They're closing. Don't bars like this stay open till dawn? The curtain has to fall sometime. We're allowed a few hours of fresh air, of purity. But you wouldn't know about purity. Do it the other way round. She starts off talking to herself, then comes back to me. Again. We're allowed a few hours of fresh air, of purity. Back to me. But you wouldn't know about purity. He's fixated with her. He didn't spend an hour on my part. Have some humility, young man. In the theatre, the woman is queen. Otherwise join the cabaret, with the homos. She's not half bad. Yes, with a little padding. If she wants to play bar-room hookers, she'll need to... She's deceptively thin. Jacqueline is my pseudonym. Did you think I'd sully my real one? You're laying it on too thick. The feeling's all wrong. Forget you know the end. It's like she already knows he's her father. I know it, so does the audience. You don't. Think of the situation. For now, he's some guy asking her weird questions. A punter looking for a shoulder to cry on. Try it again. Jacqueline is my pseudonym. - Did you think I'd... - No! You're not listening. - Not if you shout. - I'm not shouting. I'm shouting without shouting. It's natural. It's a way of talking. I'm tired, I can't go on. We'll come back to it tomorrow. It's a difficult scene. - I might cut it down. - No. She can do it. You have to. If you don't nail it now, you'll lose it. A character is like a person. You can't leave it when it's in danger. Come on! Off you go! Jacqueline is my pseudonym. Did you think I'd sully my real one? I'd have liked to invent one just for me. Please, enough. I can see through your little game. You're just a lowlife who fakes his emotions. And with a clear conscience too! I can't be your lover, Jacqueline. Yes. That's good. Right, that'll do for today. Same time tomorrow. Lift! Where the hell are they? You know how women are. They take forever to get ready. She forgets her perfume, loses her gloves. The man's stamping his feet. They're a couple. A couple? So why don't they announce the wedding? Apparently for young people, what was once a sacrament is now a passion killer. Are you even sure it's what you want? You talk as if you already had your medal. - That hurt! - You deserved it. Rosette or salami, it's all the same. Reception, drinks, France on a plate. Enough to make you sick. - So you won't go? - No. And neither will you. I don't want you fraternising with those pigs. Nor will you perform any of their circus tricks. I won't let you appear in that pornographic filth. - It opens in a week. - Then give up the role. That's out of the question. Can't you see those people will kill you? Kill us? They're our enemies. This part is a unique opportunity for me. I can't let it pass me by. You mean you went all out to get it. Yes. You slept with the old man. No. - I'm not looking for a saint. - What, then? You don't know what you want. I want loyalty. Why do you hurt me, Lisa? I wouldn't hurt you, Paul, if you'd only understand. I'll be your friend, your ally, your wife if you want. But don't ask me to give up the theatre. I can't. I want you to come. I'm asking you to. Ah! Finally. Give me that. You look lovely. - Paul's not coming. - Let's go! To honour in you the impeccable artist and flamboyant figure appearing from behind the scarlet curtain into the dazzling footlights, Victor Derval, in the name of the President of the Republic, I name you Officer of the Legion of Honour. Let me pass, I'm Mr Derval's son. Minister, ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, this honour that you are bestowing on me was unimaginable to me in my youth, when the only honour I knew was the dunce's cap which the teachers placed on my idiotic head. Indeed, the theatre, or should I say the stage, was my only source of education. Moreover, it is not in my name that I receive this honour, but in the name of you all; for as much as France, where I was born, you, the audience, are my country. Good evening, Paul. You must be very moved. And you, Coste, are you taking notes? For a future play, perhaps? The other side of the medal... I don't blame you for mocking it. I was lucky enough to have mediocre parents. It can't be easy being the son of Victor Derval. Yes, I confess. I dream of exchanging the ship of state for the chariot of Thespis. Ever since that vehicle rattled along the roads of Attica, the actor's art has amused us, moved us... Excuse me, Minister. and held up a mirror in which to see ourselves. - Sorry. - Bravo again, Mr Derval. Excuse me. What... I'm coming with you. We have so little time together. I want to touch you, I want to caress you. What's going on? I was waiting for you. Some milk? No, thanks. It sobers you up. Paul. It's time to go to bed. To bed? With whom? I really think you should go to bed. One moment, maestro. A word of advice. So... I've an idea for a play. A time-honoured tale. A silly young man. A girl who is poor and dishonest. A father with a ruddy complexion, unencumbered by scruples. The perfect trio. The scene is set. But what about the end? How would it play out for you, Dad? There'd be a gun. Paul, that's enough. Put it down! Don't worry, it's a prop. - Paul, no! - You're both dead. No! Is that you? I'm scared. You were right not to come to the cemetery. It was unbearable. - What did they say? - Nothing. They don't know. And if anyone talks, I'll crush them. What will happen to us now? There's nothing left. - Nothing left to... - Be quiet! - We did it. - No. No. He was just a poor kid. I never understood him. I never saw who he was. That's all. But he'd no right to do that. Now it's just the two of us, Lisa. We'll leave Paris. The theatre's over. The theatre? I just cancelled the play. He cursed us. I'm dirty! I can't do it any more! But we're alive! Alive! Yes. It's horrible. Lisa. Lisa? She's gone, sir. Gone? Gone where? I don't know, sir. I don't know. Lisa, I need you. Reply to me, please. Lisa, believe me. I'm no longer the man I was. The man who confused theatre and real life. I lost Paul because I didn't know how to love him. But in my terrible solitude, I reject with all my strength the idea of losing you too. You, Lisa, who taught me how to love. Listen to me. Lisa, listen to me. I can no longer live without you, far from you, apart from you. We can go onstage tonight or not, just as you wish. But I beg you, come back. We can only recover together. Are you religious? No. But I feel at home here. I'll be brutal. You've suffered a tragic loss. But you didn't love that boy. - I forbid you from saying... - Wait. He was a nice enough chap, but he was a failure. I don't say that because he hated my work. You're not guilty in this case. Sometimes fate intervenes where events are pre-ordained. Whatever the role, it always ends badly. That's a writer talking. Yes. A writer who wants his plays performed. And by you. You're my lost girl. I wrote the play for you. Don't you understand? Not for anyone else. If you won't do it, I'll withdraw the play. I won't do it with him. I can't look him in the face. It won't be him. It'll be the greatest actor in Paris. A monster perhaps, but all you need do is speak my lines. - Why me? You're intelligent, you're beautiful. You're an actress. You're always asking for money. It's not a question of money, but of principle. I've never seen such a packed house. Shall we? - They all came. - Grief attracts them. To think we nearly didn't go on! I'm nervous. I'll wait in the dressing room, I don't want to see this. Nothing but ugly faces with aristocratic names. I'm quite confident. I left the keys on the bedside table. - There's no point. - Why? The house will be empty from now on. So you accepted the case? - You're going to court? - I'll never go to court again. What? Ah! I waited till everything was clear, with cruel perfection. I made you some eggnog. But first you must cast off all this love. Very good. Are you listening? I'm really nervous. I thought I could love you, weak as I am. But when I realised Jean... She looks fragile. I hope you know what you're doing. You won't ruin her scene, will you? That wouldn't be good, Victor. Only you, I thought, could close the windows against the wind, during the storm. Follow you? No. I can't do that. My girl, in the name of absence and of forgetfulness, you must not refuse. Refusing is unacceptable is that it? You're my father. So what? A stranger walks into a bar at 3am and tells me the life story of a young girl I don't know and don't want to be. A fool's game! As blind and selfish as you are, you can't understand. I can only hate the girl of your dreams. But dreams come true! You've no choice. I'm offering you a new start. I'll help you, my beloved child. - I'll help you... - To forget the brothels, the dirty sheets. And what if I like the filth and all its sordid details? You know, despair is nothing but a daily drug. A routine. A shattered soul that wanders the earth, in no particular position. And then, Father, you appear with your smiling face, your arms full of flowers, to stealthily rob me of my life. - Only it's too late. - But why? Too late? Give me your suffering. Give me all the world's troubles. Then we'll finally be equal. We'll carry the same weight of anguish. Does our ordeal, our long separation really count for nothing? The ordeal ends here. Let's ask no more of fate. We'll not meet again, Father. We'll have only the right to love each other for as long as our eyes meet. For the rest of our lives. - What's going on? - We're closing! Turn the light on! That's disgusting! Where is she? Where is she? Pay your bill and get out! - Open up! - Curtain! Come on, kids! Everybody smile! Close it. Open. Come on. Go on. Wait. Close it. Open, damn it! Go on! - One more. - Wonderful! You were magnificent. Do you hear them? You can play any role now. We'll act together. We'll live together. Never! Bravo! - The posters are done. - It's all sorted. And now, the view from backstage. Despite the success of The Lost Girl, two of the cast, formerly close friends, wish to end their fraught on-stage relationship. Apparently the triumph of youth has cast maturity in the shade. Do the living wait on the dead? I wonder. I now realise I don't believe in God. Excuse me, sir. Who are they from? On the Left Bank, you... They'd cross the river on horseback to see you. Hulin worked here for 3 years. And you'll run it yourself? Yes. I have carte blanche. I'm totally free. - I'm indebted to you. - Why? Because it's thanks to you. Certain encounters make you realise you've been too tame, fearful, cowardly. Now I only want to write for you. You mean you don't want to write for someone else. He's a fine actor. We broke up on a success, so we're even. We'd reached the end of the road. Is the same true for you? I've started something. I won't talk about it now. But I see you in it. Yes, after Chekhov. You'll get to play Chekhov. I think I'll write even better because I love you. But I don't love you, Coste. What do we know of love? What course it takes? Love is something we dream. Though it's my stock-in trade, as it were, I had never experienced it. But I can't be yours. I ask only that you be with me. I won't touch you. If I kiss your hand, take it as a homage, pure, worthy of one for whom I have waited. "The angelic slut and the eternal virgin." - Are they lovers? - What do you think? He probably makes love like a deflated inner tube. He got himself in debt up to his neck to give her a play by that Russian consumptive. Can we finish the letter? The newspaper's waiting. Yes, you're right. So... "Faced with the rampant invasion "of Mujiks and Kalmucks, "what is Derval's response?" I don't know. Molière. Write that. "But fortunately, Molière, our common father, "the plain and loyal Molière, "that quintessentially French genius, "who can amuse people while speaking of human suffering, "invites us to draw on our eternal resources." Full stop. You want to play Molière? Yes. Know what I like about him? No. The fact that he's dead. It's brave playing Alceste here. - Are you happy? - Not as happy as you. That's a good start. Betty, you're wearing the fixed smile of a hospital visitor. What do you mean? You did an extraordinary job. - They laughed. - But at what, Pastorini? They laughed in the wrong places. They're right to. It's not Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. Alceste is a pain, but he's moving because he's young. And he's thin, too. I'm hungry. Where are we eating? At the Cantina! Again. Goodnight, Mr Derval. How was the girl? Like cold mutton. All this time, and you haven't moved? Don't you want to...? What else was I supposed to do? You could at least have held on to her. You're in a bad way. Omne animal post coitum triste est. That's right! You know Latin. You could always be a priest's maid. - You're not funny, Victor. - Two hours! Even a dog would've gone for a piss. You disappoint me, old friend. - You're all washed up. - Want me to go? Yes. I'm kicking you out. Disappear. - I never want to see you again. - How will I make a living? You'll have a pension. I'll pay not to see you again. Get lost! - Home, sir? - No. The red-light district's a long way. - I can't bear it. - Hurry up! Roll up, ladies and gentlemen, and listen to... I'm sorry, sir, but the young lady is unwell... Leave us. Hello. Hello. Can I get you anything? No, thanks. Please forgive my unkempt appearance. But I... I haven't shaved, I haven't been home. I wanted to see you. It's been a while. I haven't seen your play yet. Everyone says you're magnificent. I remembered my lessons, that's all. The little match girl is long gone. I think we could see each other again now. We've suffered enough. I don't think I'm suffering any more. - We deserved to forget. - No. But we can't. We can't. We can't live all our lives with a nightmare. That's not it. You see, I feel he's been dead a long time. That's a horrible thing to say! I need you, Lisa. Listen to me. I never believed it was possible to need someone like this. I don't want to run away or cheat any more. I love you, Lisa. You haven't understood, then? I don't love you. I no longer love you. It's a brave move, your Left-Bank theatre. I hope your sponsors have sturdy backs. If you have the slightest problem, you know I'm here. We're selling out every night. Ah! Good news! What's the next play? Yours, I mean. If I'm not much mistaken, this is it. Well, I never! It's a masterpiece. It's likely to surprise, shock even. I'd be reluctant to involve a man like you in such an adventure. It never crossed my mind. I know for whom you write. You're right to. She's wonderful. Everyone knows that now. It's not only us who recognise her talent. True. She's getting a lot of offers. And that's not all. It's inevitable. For a young actress, the wings of our old theatres smell of sweat, dust and hay fever. Then there's the siren call: why play for small audiences when you can delight the crowds? I don't see what you're getting at, Derval. I was at Joinville studios yesterday. They still want me for a film. They said our young friend was leaving France. Quite soon. Didn't you know? Le Havre, New York. New York, Hollywood. You're lying! She's signed a contract. But we can still teach her a lesson before she leaves. Lisa, come and see. It's incredible. Look. - What's going on? - I don't know. There wasn't one empty seat. - Curtain in 10 minutes. - It's empty. We have the minimum quota: one audience member more than the cast. Who are they? Is this a joke? What difference does it make? You'll be paid all the same. - Where's Coste? - No idea. - We had the best houses in Paris. - Tonight's no exception. - What do you mean? - One individual bought all the tickets. We're not going on. We're not going on. - Do you agree? - We are! We're going on. Yes. We're going on. It's... How can I put it? Pleasant, talented. But after Tolstoy and Zola, no-one wants to read Trigorine. I hear footsteps. I can't live without her. Even her footsteps are lovely. I hear footsteps. I'm deliriously happy. My angel. My dream. I'm not late, am I? - I'm not late, am I? - No... No. All day... All day I've been worried. I was so afraid my father would stop me coming. No longer loving you is beyond my strength, Nina. I call you, I kiss the ground you walked on. My father and his wife don't want me to come here. They're afraid I'll become an actress. But I... But I... Why do you say you kissed the ground I walked on? You should kill me rather. I am so tired. Oh, if I could only rest! Rest! I'm a seagull. No. I'm not. I'm an actress. Yes, of course. And he is here, too. Yes. It doesn't matter. He didn't believe in the theatre. He always made fun of my dreams. Little by little, I too lost faith in it. I became trivial, insignificant. I acted in an absurd way. I never knew what to do with my hands, where to stand or how to control my voice. You can't know how it feels to know you're acting badly. I'm a seagull. No. I'm not. What was I saying? Do you remember, you killed a seagull? A man passed by and idly took its life. An idea for a short story. No. That wasn't it. What was I saying? I was talking about the theatre. Yes. Now I feel differently. I am a real actress. I act with joy, with exaltation. I am intoxicated by it, and feel that I am superb. Ever since I've been here, I've been walking. Walking and thinking. I think, and I feel my strength growing in me every day. I know now, Kostia. I understand that in our profession, whether we act or write, what matters is neither glory nor fame, nor any of the things I dreamt of. But the gift of patience. Knowing how to bear one's cross and have faith. I believe and my pain subsides. And when I think of my vocation, I am no longer afraid of life. Hush! Farewell! When I have become a famous actress, you must come and see me. Do you promise? But now it's late. I'm exhausted. And when I think of my vocation, I am no longer afraid of life. Subtitles: ECLAIR
