TUNE PLAYS OUT ON METAL PIPES PLAY BAGPIPES DRONE TRADITIONAL TUNE PLAYS TUNE CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND - How's Connors? - Not too bad. And it's yourself that's in it? - By God, you're looking great. - Sit yourself down. You're looking great. Such a powerful man. Take it easy on that, now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we'll try again. Tell me, how long is your wife dead now? Er, she's buried eight year now. And is he the youngest son you have? The only son alive. I must say, he's a handy-looking fella. Oh, he is. You get away! He'd mend anything on wheels. Only for that he wouldn't get my fine daughter. When you got married, did you get anything along with the wife? - I mean, any dowry? - No. I didn't. - Nothing at all? - Nuh. Neither did I. Yes, they told you only those? That's all. Neither will I give anything with my daughter, either. By God, I'll hardly give the son. What are you talking about? - What do you want, money? - Yes. Do you think I'm a millionaire or something? - Oh, well... - Sure, only for that border we wouldn't have a... a ha'penny. Well, still... Won't I have to get that grey horse? - Grey horse? - Yeah? I'll tell you what to do, put it there. Is it done? I'll give you the mule. - It is. No, I... - I won't give you the horse. Dear children of God, you've come to this church so that the Lord may see your love in the presence of the priest and this community. Christian marriage is a sacred union which enriches natural love. It binds those who enter it to be faithful to each other forever. It creates between them a bond that endures for life and cannot be broken. It demands that they love and honour each other, that they accept from God the children He may give them and bring them up in His love. To help them in their marriage, the husband and wife receive the lifelong grace of the Sacrament. Is this your understanding of marriage? - It is. - Yes. Michael and Angela, you are about to celebrate this sacrament. Have you come here of your own free will and choice and without compulsion to marry each other? - We have. - Hmm. Will you love and honour each other in marriage all the days of your life? BOTH: We will. Are willing to accept with love the children God may send you and bring them up in accordance with the law of Christ - and his church? - BOTH: We are. Have you the ring, Michael? SIREN WAILS OUTSIDE Now, Michael, take this in your hand. Give over your left hand. Now, say this... Er, "Wear this ring as a sign of our love and fidelity." Wear this ring as a sign of our love and fidelity. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Now that Michael and Angela have given themselves to each other in Christian marriage, I ask God our Father to keep them and all married couples faithful to Him and united in themselves. - For Michael and Angela... - Excuse me. Ah, no, no, no! INDISTINCT PRIEST CLEARS HIS THROAT I've just been informed that there's a fire in a warehouse near the church. I would ask all the congregation to leave quietly and take their vans and cars off the street.

We'd say to him every day... .."Do you believe in the Assumption of the Virgin Mary?" They taught us at school that the Prods weren't meant to. And every day the poor fucker would say no.
