Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, my client demands that the scales of justice be tipped in his favor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it is time to rip off the blindfold and let justice see. Sorry, honey, you were really on a roll, but I got court in ten, so... I am liking that second version. Thanks! I should use the basement ladies' room more often. It's where all the magic happens. These were supposed to be Jerome Johnson's golden years. A widower, starting to date again. Crossing items off his bucket list, like zipping around town on one of those hip electric scooters. What was not on his list was a broken hip from being sideswiped by a city bus on Pike Street. The Seattle Transit Authority thwarts victims from pursuing damages by overwhelming them with confusing, endless, bureaucratic red tape. They count on justice to turn a blind eye. But it is time to rip off the blindfold and let justice see. You saved my heinie in there, kid. I'll find a way to pay you back. - I promise. - Don't worry about it. Just get home safe. All right. Nah, I ghosted her. She gone. Nothing but net.

We might be ordering that pizza. Uh... you know, I would. But I'm just kinda beat, and I got a full inbox calling my name, so, rain check? Game night Friday. Yes, definitely. Monopoly money's the only kind I'm going to be seeing this week. - See ya. - Bye! Yeah! - I'm ordering Domino's! - Ooh, That's smart. Good morning, Seattle. The forecast is rain, rain, and, yep, more rain. And now it's time for the KNVB radio traffic report. Okay. No, Ms. Kapoor, just, just slow down. Okay, what's happening? No, your landlord can not put a padlock on your front door. Double espresso for Nick. Pumpkin spice latte for Susan. Yes. Yes, I'm sure. Yes. No, I don't care what the notice says. I'm positive. And it's not just immoral, by the way, it's illegal. Yes. All right, well I'm gonna get into it with his lawyer as soon as I'm back at the office. Yes. I'm so sorry this is happening, you know, it's not-- - Oh. - I'm so sorry, I just didn't see you. Guess they forgot to patch me in. Uh... Okay. No, I'm still here. Yes, I will call you as soon as I can. You know it's a scam, right? What? Pumpkin spice latte. No pumpkin in it. - Just pumpkin flavoring. - Hmm. Every fall, the coffee industry acts like some bountiful pumpkin harvest just came in, so they can peddle their drinks to the masses. You're drinking a lie. Why are you still talking to me? I dunno, we're walking in the same direction? Better to make conversation than have awkward silence, right? This is neither. This is an awkward conversation. Well... then it's both. - Can I help you with something? - The door? I have a 9 a.m. appointment. - Welcome to Whitaker and Associates. - Thank you. Congratulations! - Yay! - Woohoo! Okay... Where's the water cooler going? The wave was part celebration, part smoke screen. Turns out, pro bono is Latin for tap water. If you're gonna work for free, I have to make budget cuts. - Buh-bye. - Buh-bye. Bye. Hello. Is it my birthday? You must be Nick Evans. Nick is your 9 a.m.. This is awkward. So... how can I help you, Mr. Evans? I need a lawyer. And you have a reputation of being one of the classiest bus bench lawyers in town. Never done a bus bench ad. Oh, I'm sorry, what is it? Is it ambulance chaser? Is that what it's called? - Civil litigator works fine. - Civil litigator. That's cool. Alright, well, how much you charge? - Let's talk about your complaint first. - Right. I want to sue Love Guaranteed. - The dating website? - Mm-hm. Okay. Were you threatened on a date? Stalked? Harmed? Worse. I'm a victim of fraud. - Sorry? - Love Guaranteed is robbing people of 29.95 a month with their slogan, "You'll find love, guaranteed." Well, I've been on 986 different dates, and not one of them has provided me love. Nine hundred and eighty-six dates with... actual human women? Yes, the user agreement fine print states that a subscriber must go on 1000 different dates for the guarantee to apply. Their lawyers clearly thought no one would go through with it, but... I did! Well, home stretch anyways, I got like a dozen to go. Yeah, I'm just... still a little in the weeds on this whole 986 dates of it all. Uh... how is that even possible? It's a great question. Uh, breakfast, lunch, and dinner dates. - That's how I do it. - Okay. Guy's gotta eat, right? Did it ever occur to you that maybe love was never found because no woman wants to hear "Guy's gotta eat, right"? I'm not saying it at the date. I'm not like, "Hey, guy's gotta eat." I'm not doing that, that's not what I'm doing. I'm thinking it in my head. Look, the point is, I have a case. Okay, a winnable case. I didn't pass the bar yesterday. I know what this is. What is it? This is a classic "gotcha" lawsuit. Find a loophole, take the easy cash. Think what you want, but Love Guaranteed is profiting off the lonely souls of the world. It is not right. It is reckless endangerment of the human heart and I will not stand for it. The human heart! Right. It's good. So, how much for a retainer? Let me review the merits of your case first. Go ahead. Don't take too long. Pretty sure your team would like the return of their water cooler. How'd it go? Someone looks like they could use a cocktail. - It's 9:15. - Never stopped me. Oh. What else we got? Bills, bills, and oh hey, look, more bills. Mr. Bahar wants to defer payment another month. And there's a scary-looking envelope from the landlord. But I did put a Bed Bath and Beyond coupon in there, so it's not all bad news. - You're doing the Lord's work, Denise. - Thank you. He's raising the rent. - Again. - It's just a hiccup. We'll be fine. Say something. Is our goldfish okay? He's sleeping. He's sleeping? She can read me like a book. Vrum! Why do I have a feeling I'm going to be seeing you in court some day? - Okay. - How you feeling? - I'm dying and everything hurts. - Aw, buddy. Where's my glowing? You know, I was promised glowing. - You look great. - I'm fat. But you're the really good kind of fat, you know? Like a little avocado. Excuse me while I drop my decaf in slow motion. A dating site? It's for a case. Wow, you are so taking this case. No, he's the client. - A hot client. - Gross client. Hot gross client. Obnoxious, gross, hot only to a certain desperate kind of woman who is not me, still perspective client. Hmm. - Hey, everybody! - Woo-hoo - Daddy! - Who wants Ben and Jerry's? Not in front of the kid, or we have to share. - Share what? - Nothing! Buddy, come here. - He's still wearing his dinner. - Yes, I see that. Okay, bath time, kiddo. Come on. High-five your Auntie Susan good night. Nice buddy. Night! What did you eat exactly? My brother-in-law might be an actual saint. Hmm. Saint Gideon did not miraculously fall from the sky like frozen airplane toilet water. You know how we met? - Yes, I know, online dating. - Mm-hm. Can you believe this guy's been on almost a thousand dates? - Are you serious? - He's a classic loophole shark. He's exploiting this company over a tiny detail in the fine print. Hmm. - Interesting case. - Ridiculous case. I mean, my mission is to help the helpless. He's not helpless. He's shameless. Shameless pays the bills. It would mean that my employees could stop job hunting. Roberto left his laptop open with his resume there. I fixed a typo. Of course you did. - Hello? - Mr. Evans, hi, it's Susan Whitaker. Uh... We can start tomorrow. Okay, team. The first thing we need to do is take a deep dive into the strange and prolific dating life of Mr. Nicholas Evans. Finally a fun case. This case is not going to be a walk in the park. Love Guaranteed is owned by none other than Tamara Taylor. We just won big time. Mm-hm. I'm sorry, Tiffany what now? Tamara Taylor, the lifestyle guru who tells women to eat nothing but soaked almonds and to steam their... I'm caught up. She is Forbes 500-level loaded, meaning she is going to be lawyered up. Our case has to be airtight. You know, I'm looking forward to taking on Love Guaranteed. Hi, Roberto, accounting. Are you about to do the big speech? Because if this is the big speech, I have to use the restroom first. All those corporate fat cats and their $200 haircuts and their fancy watches. They're not even gonna know what hit 'em. I should go, right? - You should go. - No. Okay, sorry. No big speech. Please, use the restroom. Meeting over. This is exciting! Standing up for the little guy. Online dating can just be so soul crushing. I wouldn't know. Luckily, I've never tried it. What? I'm sorry, you've never online dated? No, what's the big deal? You can't win a case over something you know nothing about. We need to get you online. - Mm-hm. - No. - Yeah! - No! No, I don't have time for dating. It's not dating! What if it's research? You know, it could make the difference between winning or losing this case. What are you about to do here? - Creating your profile. - I thought you had to pee. - It can wait. - This is so fun. Okay, fine. But listen, I am proofing it first. Don't make me sound weird. Don't worry! We got this. Hey just for fun, what photo were you thinking-- Go! - Chuckles] - Oh, I like that. - Ooh! - Right? - I don't know if men would. - Oh. It's both helpful and a little bit creepy that you meticulously documented all of your dates. Thank you. Figured I'd need a paper trail. The one who talked about cats all night? Yeah, didn't even own a cat. The one who brought her parents on the date? Yeah. She never said a word, but her dad was awesome. I mean, we talked about baseball for hours, it was great. I wish I would've got his number. The one who needed a date to her sister's wedding. Yeah, two tickets to Hawaii seemed kind of extra for date numero dos. The one who got drunk and tried to fight the busboy? For the record? I took the punch. Okay, Nick, you cannot name these women like they're episodes of Friends. It's the only way to keep them apart, you know how many Chloes I've dated? Fourteen! Plus 12 Emmas and like, half a dozen Zoes. Okay, little accountability please. You're the one dating in bulk. This lawsuit isn't just about me, you know. Love Guaranteed took advantage of them, too. So what are you gonna do if we win? You're gonna split the damages with a thousand different women? No, I have plans for that money. I bet you do. And just so you know, I was always a perfect gentleman to them. I took these women on classy dates. Split the check at Denny's? No disrespect to the Grand Slam Breakfast, but give a guy some credit, okay? Breakfast at Bacco, lunch at Pink Door, and dinner at Coral. Coral? That place is fancy. Yes. And I paid every time. Alright, I'm impressed. More with your time management than anything. Yeah? Got most dates down to under an hour. Quicker than an oil change. Okay, do you have a heart, or just an empty space where you keep your car keys? Yeah, it's empty. - I gotta go. - Hot date? - Yep. - What? That was a bad joke, it's 10 a.m. Yeah. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner dates. It's breakfast. You poor, poor girls. I know I'm married, but I'd love to see him in my chambers. For a debriefing. Heyo! He's an opportunist. We should be ashamed for taking this case. - Hello. - Ain't no shame in this game. Precious cargo coming through! Ooh, I love our new paying client. We'll see about that. - What is that? - Files. From Nick's dates. In order for this case to fly, all of them have to be corroborated, so good luck with that. Incoming! What's going on? We just went live. - What are you talking about? - Your inbox for Love Guaranteed. You were supposed to let me proof it first! Why would you use that photo? It was the only picture we could find where you weren't working. That's from my birthday at Tortilla Flats, I was wasted. A drink-y Susan is a dateable Susan. I do dip my french fries in mayo. I do like old dogs better than puppies. Wait, how do you guys know all this stuff about me? - Lots of overtime. - I went through your garbage. They're lighting up like planes on a runway. Whoa. No. No. Maybe. No, not right now, no. I have to interview Nick's dates for their depositions. Which you can do while going on dates of your own. Mr. Yang next door is willing to offer you a friends and family lunch discount. I do love Yang's. He's weirdly as excited as we are. For research. Ooh, how about this one in the flannel? Looks like a lumberjack. - Like an educated lumberjack. - That's not a thing. - A lumbersexual? - Oh, that's a thing. Uh... hi there. My name's Susan Whitaker, I'm an attorney in the area. I was just wondering, did you ever go on a date with Nicholas Evans? Yes, I remember him. Because he actually looked like his photo. Some dates don't look like their photos? Really? So how'd the date go? - It was the best date I've ever been on. - Mm-hm. Wish he would've asked for my number! Nick was the best. Just a nice, normal guy. Like, super normal. Some dates are abnormal? So, intermittent fasting, huh? Yeah. As in you just purposely don't eat? - I'm actually up to 20 hours a day now. - Wow. Hmm... isn't that dangerous, or... No, it's super good for you. It's actually how... cavemen used to... to eat. Wasn't the life expectancy for a caveman like, 25? Check! So, tell me about your date with Nick Evans. The date was fine, but I knew he wasn't for me. I got a vibe. What kind of a vibe? It's like Nick believes he's genuinely looking for love. But instead he's trying to prove that love doesn't exist. Huh. Did you ever find a date to your sister's wedding? - It was canceled. - Oh. Turns out the groom's in love with my mom, and not my sister. Could you die? Wow. Holidays must be interesting at your house. At least Nick showed up. My last online date totally ghosted me. Some dates just don't show up? You guys, I don't know how Nick managed it. I don't. I've been on two dates and one no-show, and I am exhausted. Why do you think I proposed to Dante after two weeks? It's a jungle out there. There's plenty of fish in the sea. There's also plenty of trash. - The affidavits for Nick to sign. - I'll drive them over. I can e-mail them and he can docu-sign. Are you kidding me? I'm beyond curious to see where this guy works. I bet you he's a Crossfit instructor. Probably runs an illegal poker game out of a parking garage. Surprise, you're both wrong. Hm. - Let's go, man. - Some might call this elder abuse. - Faster, okay? - Alright. Once I'm on my feet, I'm gonna ask Donna over there to go dancing. Hey, Donna. You ever been dipped in an Argentine tango? Be careful, she's a maneater. Oh, here's hoping. Jerome, you nasty. Wait. What... What is happening? My crusader for justice. Okay, so many things are finally making sense. I didn't know you made house calls. I'm just doing my due diligence. Right, checking up on me. - Something like that. - Making sure I'm an upstanding citizen. And he's making me a standing up citizen. Alright, comedian, I'll see ya Thursday. I'll be with you in two seconds. So, you're how I landed my new client. Told you I wouldn't forget. Tossed business your way. Surprised? Nick is surprising. Doctor said, my dancing days are over. Nick said, hogwash. Nick donates his time here for the old folks like me that can't afford PT. He's a good egg. Like you. And two good eggs make an omelet. Donna. Donna. Okay. So what do we got? Just a few things for you to sign. Oh. It's just the bottom there. Cool. Oh, guess what? - What? - Tomorrow's it. My one thousandth date. - Well. - Yeah. Uh... - Congratulations. - Thank you. Hm. So, show me her profile. - For my date? - Yes. - I don't think that's such a good idea. - Why not? - I don't know, weird. - It's for the case. - For the case? - Sure. Sure. Okay, well... Here. - Here? Okay. - Press down. - Pam. - Mm-hm. Pam is 32, she is a fifth grade teacher, she enjoys hiking and gardening. Huh. She seems adorable. Adorable is a number one red flag. Anything that sounds too good to be true on the internet is a lie. I have noticed that. Yeah, well, wish me luck. Hardly seems appropriate. Right. - 'Cause the case. - Right. I don't do sugar, vinegar, dairy, gluten, seeds, or nightshades. Ooh! No. Mm-hm. Get you a drink while you wait? Glass of Pinot, please. Does the pecan-crusted tuna have nuts in it? It's crusted in pecans. Right. Better bring the whole bottle. Oh! Damn it. Seriously, could this menu have more shellfish on it? If I even eat one mollusk I'll be covered in eczema like the Elephant Man. Did you... hear the one about the greedy clam? He was a little shellfish. A little shellfish. Good evening. For how many? Shocker. The teriyaki chicken would be nice, if I brought my Epi-pen. Which I didn't. Okay, well, look me up on LinkedIn. Hm. Hey. I know you. Susan! Hey! No! Oh, God, no. Susan! Susan! Yes, it's me! Shhh. It's Susan, everybody. We used to date. I know. - Watch it! - May I... purchase you a drink? What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be fasting? Hm. It's my eating window. Smells like your drinking window. It's a bit of that, too. You know. No! Oh. Can you listen to me? You need a sandwich and a nap! Up on three. One, two... Hm. Hmm. Maybe I'll slide into your DMs later. - Gross. - Hmm. Thank you. - Who's that? - That is my lawyer. I mean, these women, they could be subpoenaed. I had to make sure that you weren't intentionally tanking the dates. - You were spying on me. - No! - Yeah, you were. - No! A little. Professionally. - "Professionally." - I'm sorry I ruined your date. It's okay, it was terrible. It really was. She knows. Whoa! - You work fast, Nick. - No, I'm not a... Oh, never mind. What can I get you? Oh, I'm fine. - Thank you. - Please. I'm starving. Uh... One second. Yes. Coral burger and fries. Thank you. - That's it? - Yeah. No special requests? Extra mayo. I like this one. This is where it all happens. Oh, yeah, this is my lucky table. Is it, though? Actually, no. This thing is cursed. Let's go sit somewhere else. - Let's go. - Yeah. The only thing I ever wanted to do was play ball. But then I slid into home, tore my ACL. You know, it's funny that your whole life can just change in the blink of an eye. That's terrible, I'm sorry. Only thing that got me through it was my PT, Rasheed. - Hm. - This dude was so funny. He just really inspired me to do the hard work to heal, you know? Nice. And so I decided to become a PT myself. Do the same thing. - Inspire through humor. - No, I'm mean. I yell a lot. What about you? I bet you were - the kid crusader for justice. - What? Busting rigged hide-and-go-seek games around the neighborhood. How'd you know they were rigged? No, I suppose you're right. Yeah. I do feel like there's something hardwired in me from birth, to want to just fight for the little guy. One time when I was really little, my parents took me to see The Fugitive. And I got so upset that they convicted an innocent man. I'm still upset. But I had to go wait in the lobby. Couldn't take it. You serious? My dad tried to get me to come back into the theater, but I wouldn't. Still haven't seen the end of that movie. - You didn't see The Fugitive? - No. You never saw the One-Armed Man? If that's a reference to The Fugitive, no. Before the trial is over, we are watching The Fugitive together, okay? It's a date. But... also not. - I know what you meant. Yeah. - You get it. Great. Actually... this is the best dinner I've had in a really long time. Same. So... you know all about my love life. Why don't you tell me about yours? - There's nothing much to tell. - I find that hard to believe. Well, I'm running a business. It's a lot. I just don't have time for a relationship right now. Someday, you know, I will. Just not today. Hmm. There had to be someone. Of course there was someone. Sure, back in law school. His name was Josh. We thought we were gonna get married, have kids, dogs, whole thing, but... I don't know, he had other plans. What kind of plans? Just the kind that did not include me. Seriously, how far did you park? Okay, valet at Coral? Twelve dollars? It's highway robbery. Right. Hm. Oh! So this is yours? Yep, this is Zorro. - Nice, Zorro, that's sweet. - Sweet? No, Zorro is a vigilante who tracks down ruthless villains. - A lot tougher than she looks, huh? - Yeah. - Let me get that for you. - Oh, no, I got it. Literally got it. Well, you are full of surprises. So are you. - Handshake. - Yeah. It's my signature end-of-the-date move. It's my way of saying goodbye, good luck, have a nice life. So it's an efficient transaction. Yes, it is. So, tell me, if you were going to name tonight like an episode of Friends, what would my title be? "The one I didn't see coming." Night. Night, Susan. - What's that noise in your car? - Oh, it's Tiffany. - Tiffany? - Yeah. No idea what that is. What? Tiffany, she was like one of the biggest singers in the 1980s. - Oh, Tiffany Tiffany. - Yes, Tiffany. Yeah, still don't know. I have no clue. You must have, it's so-- Are you kidding? I can't tell. Possibly. Good night, Nick. Good night, Tiffany. Ms. Kapoor, you can call your own exterminator. Yes, absolutely. Tenant law stipulates that you're entitled to a pest-free apartment. Absolute-- Okay. Well let me know how it goes, Ms. K. Thank you. Roberto, there is this concept called knocking. - You make a fist, you pull it back-- - Okay, fine. - Love Guaranteed is on line two. - You can burst in for that. Susan Whitaker. Mm-hm. Uh-huh. Yes, absolutely. We look forward to it. That was Bill Jones, lead counsel for Love Guaranteed. He invited us to a meeting at their headquarters with none other than Tamara Taylor. Keep it close. Oh... cozy. Right? Hi. Susan Whitaker and Nicholas Evans for Tamara Taylor. Sign in there, please. And fourth floor penthouse. Right, Brad and Veronica met at Love Guaranteed. Brad and Veronica are clearly models. Just 'cause they're implausibly attractive doesn't mean that they're paid models. Don't you have faith in anything good in this world? Sure. Just not in Brad and Veronica. They fake and they phony. Look at those teeth, too white. Some ground rules before we go in there: I do the talking. You, no snarking, no snickering, no snorting. Snorting? Yes, when you're trying not to laugh you make a sound kind of like... I don't-- - That sounds nothing like me. - It's exactly like you. - Nope. - We'll see. Ms. Whitaker. - Bill Jones. - My client, Nick Evans. - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. Please. Right. We're ready for her. Tashi delek. Jug rog nang. Tibetan greeting. Namaste. Have you been offered a drink? Filtered stream water? I have it flown in from Chile. I'm fine. - We're fine. - Micah, serve them water. All right. I was shocked and disappointed to hear that you brought a complaint against Love Guaranteed. Well, per the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, corporations are barred from engaging in misrepresentation, bait-and-switch advertising, and other fraudulent behaviors to promote their products, so... here we are. Ms. Whitaker, have you ever been to Pangong Tso in Tibet? No. It is a transformative place. I went on a two-month, barefoot walkabout through the high grasslands, asking myself, "What is my purpose on Earth?" One day, a lone bird swooped across the sky and I felt loneliness to the deepest core of my essence and I thought, "I will solve loneliness." My website brings much needed hope, love, connection, joy, happiness, life to the masses. Except that you're not selling love, joy, and hope. You're selling a love guarantee. Everyone here knows that that language is legally binding. So. We have a case. You all know it. What are you offering? Bill? Well, we have a very generous settlement to offer. One hundred thousand dollars, with a signed non-disclosure agreement. We can cut the check today. One hundred thousand dollars wouldn't even begin to cover the expenses of my client's dates. We request five hundred thousand in restitution, the promise that your company scrubs all language of a love guarantee from its website and advertising, and I would also obviously need to review any NDA before my client can sign it. I'm sorry, this isn't a negotiation. We've looked into you, Ms. Whitaker, and we see that your earnest little boutique firm is under water. You're failing. This little do-gooder, crusader for justice attitude, it might impress your clients but it doesn't do anything for me. I, well... Luckily, we are not here to talk about me. We are here to discuss this case. Then take the settlement. - We won't offer it again. - Buddha once said, "No man can step in the same river twice." Do you know why I hired Susan? - Nick, no! - Because she's the opposite of you. Okay? She has character and principles, and a sense of common decency. - Thank you. - Hmm. Well, I have a billion dollar empire to run, so just sign the papers and we'll pay you out and this little PR headache will go away. No deal. We will see you in court, where we will request one million dollars in punitive damages. Oh, and by the way, it's Heraclitus, not Buddha. What? The river quote? Yeah. Those inspirational fridge magnets, they have such tiny fine print. Really gotta read it carefully. Boom. The water is gross. Are they staring at us? Yep, all of them. - Should've taken the stairs. - Yep. - What? I mean-- - That was-- Who's idiotic idea was it to guarantee love, anyway? - Who am I firing today? - Uh... Yours. Micah, you're fired. - That was awesome. - If Tamara Taylor thinks that she can steamroll us, she's got another think coming! Yeah... thing. - Another thing coming. - No, it's think, like, "think again." Ha! No, it's thing. - Do you always have to be right? - Only when the other person's wrong. Hey, thank you. For standing up for me in there. That really meant a lot. You stand up for people all day, someone's gotta have your back. Oh! You really went in on that song, didn't you? The tape is actually stuck in the player. - Right. - Has been since the 80s. - Mm-hm. - The volume knob is also broken, so Zorro decides when it plays and when it doesn't. So your car is possessed by Tiffany. - Basically. - Great. - Why don't you get it fixed? - Oh, it's on the list. Thank you. How long is your list? How long you got? So, Susan says, "It's not Buddha, it's Heraclitus." - Who's that? - No clue. The point is, she was amazing. I mean, I've never seen anything like that in my life. She was beautiful, she was poised. You know, for a man who's been on a thousand dates, you got zero game. What are you talking about? I'm talking about Susan. Sus-- No. Susan... That's my lawyer. She's... no. Off the table. Last I checked, she was a woman first. A smart, beautiful, compassionate woman. I don't know, Jerome, that's-- What's holding you back? You just went on a thousand dates and you're afraid to go on one more? Yeah, but Susan's not like the rest. Exactly. Scary, isn't it? You've been playing in the shallow end, where it's safe. That ain't where you gonna find love. To find that, you gotta dive deeper. What if I sink? What if you swim? Susan Whitaker? Charles Gilbert, Seattle Courier. How do you plan to take on Love Guaranteed? Do you really believe Nick Evans has a case? - How did you hear that I-- - Slow news week, I was trolling courthouse filings, jackpot! Ex-pro ball player suing a dating site, now that's a human interest piece. No comment. Ms. Whitaker, if I could just get a moment-- A reporter just accosted me about Nick's case. I know, isn't it exciting? - What'd you say? - No comment. It was pretty cool. But listen, we need to focus on getting ready for the trial, not playing this case out in the press. - You're no fun. Bill Jones called. - Oh. We already have a court date. This is only six weeks away. Alright, we can do this. We gotta buckle down. I need nights and weekends. And Denise, light that candle you do when the Seahawks are playing. Anything for the team. Seahawks. Come on, focus. Oh! Oh, where are you going, boss? Love Guaranteed is definitely going to be going after Nick's character and we can't afford for there to be any surprises so I did a little Google stalking. Did you find dirt? Not that I want you to. But let's be honest, I love dirt. Yes. So, look. Nick's not on social media anymore, but I did find some crumbs. Her name's Arianna Silver. - She was not one of the thousand dates. - Nope. And we've got to cover our bases, so... I'm gonna go meet with her today. - O-M-G, she's gorgeous. - I guess. You know, if you're into the whole supermodel thing. - Everyone is. - Most people are. Okay, give me the phone. What? Holy crap. Hi, you must be Susan. I'm Arianna. - Thank you. - Thank you. Nick Evans. I haven't heard that name in a minute. How is Nicky? Nick is well. He is suing a dating website for making false claims. As I told you on the phone, I'm his attorney. Sounds like Nick. Always calling out a liar. Ah! Um... So anyway, I'm looking into his dating history. I haven't heard from Nick since the breakup. He took it hard. Very hard. So you didn't keep in touch? We broke up over two years ago. My fault. It didn't end well. Radio silence ever since. Right but you said two years. Thank you for your time. Your relationship predates my case. Wait. If Nick didn't tell you about me, - how did you find me? - Oh. Just some old social media accounts. You've been doing some digging. For the case, of course. Of course. I'll just show myself out. Kitchen. Oh, no! Hello? There's secret texting codes now? You've been on two, almost three internet dates now. - You haven't learned the lingo yet? - Obviously not. I just wanted to see if you were awake to, you know, go over a couple things. To go over-- Wait, you're still at work? So? You are not a normal human being. Fine, what about tomorrow then? Tomorrow's Saturday. What's your point? My point is it's Saturday. The one who ate paper. - Yeah. All kinds. - What? - No. - Yep. Napkins, toilet paper. - Playing cards. - No. Not kidding. Origami... I don't believe you, but I am looking forward to meeting this probably fictional person. You know, you're not the cheesy swindler I had you pegged for. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-mm. You're not the uptight lawyer I assumed you were. Happy to be wrong for once. Wrong? Okay. - Just enjoying that, sorry. - Yeah, well... But you might be a little bit right. Oh, yeah? The first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is check my phone. Answer e-mails before I even get out of bed, go to the office all day, then I come home, finish everything I didn't get done at the office, then I get back in bed with my phone, and it starts over again. It's a vicious circle. Um... Cycle. - What? - It's a "vicious cycle." - That's the saying. - No, it's "vicious circle." - Vicious circle? That sounds like a... - Yeah. Geometry teacher's rock band... The Vicious Circle! How did you find out? Uh, she told me. She said she has an imaginary friend. That she'd bring him everywhere. Brought him to the date. I hope he had a good time. She said he did. He didn't eat any of his food. Wow, you have enough food for a whole week! Exactly. That way, I don't have to think about it until I order again next weekend. I like your logic. I like your place too. - Thank you. - It's nice. Gideon's family actually owns the building. He is the most generous brother-in-law and worst landlord on the planet. If I didn't raise my own rent I think he'd probably be letting me live here for free. Kinda need to talk to you about something. I met with Arianna. As soon as I realized your relationship predated our case, I left. Okay? But you don't need me running around digging up old wounds from girlfriends past. I'm sorry. Uh... fiancée. - What? - Yeah. Two months before our wedding, she upped and moved out when I was at work. There was no warning, no letter. Yeah, it turns out she was seeing someone else. And had been seeing him for a couple months. So... yeah. Melanie! Mel! Mel, are you okay? - Yeah! My water broke. - Oh! - Everything's fine. - Okay, we heard screaming though. Yeah, that was Gideon. We gotta get to the hospital ASAP. I have the route all mapped. Where are the car keys? - You must be Nick. - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Susan talks about you all the time. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do, actually. - Course she does, I'm her favorite client. - No, that's Jerome. Jerome? I am ten times more charming than Jerome. He's got the whole cute grumpy old man thing going on. That's true. Yeah, he does have the old thing going for him. I am loving this whole back and forth banter thing going on, - but I gotta go have a baby. - Yes. Okay. All right. Gideon, I don't want to give birth in the car! We're leasing. - I can't find the car keys. - Uh, check your left hand. - Right. - Yeah. You'd think we hadn't done this birthing thing before, huh? - You got this. - Okay, sweetie. Remember our deal? You be good for Auntie Suze. - All right. - Uh, okay. My contractions are five minutes apart, if we don't leave now, we're naming our baby after the freeway she was born on. - I-90 is a terrible name. - Okay. Bye. - Here we go. - Love you. Oh, we haven't met yet. Hi, I'm Gideon, nice-- - Nick. - Oh, sorry! - Go! - Here we go. - Bye! - Bye, guys. - Be good! - Take pictures. Or... don't. - Ooh, it's exciting. - That was... yeah. I always thought I'd be at work when D-Day finally came. You know I can stick around and help out. Oh, no. You have no idea what you'd be signing up for. - Him? - Mm-hm. Piece of cake. Ooh! Ha! Yeah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! What happened? Yeah! He was like one of those Von Trapp kids and now it's all Hunger Games. Yeah! I'm scared. Yes! - Oliver. - What? Oliver, we need to open a window of negotiation about bedtime. Are you lawyering a four-year-old? I am willing to make concessions. All right, I'll be right back. Okay. What do you want? Just what do you want? Alright, who wants ice cream? - Me! - All right. Ice cream coming up, but first lay down, in bed, now. Let's go. Here. Enjoy. Voilà. That's all it took, all this time? Yeah, it's bribery. It's the oldest trick in history. - Night, kid. - Night! Oh, my goodness. Next time, I'm bringing holy water. Well... It's Gideon. "Baby Amelia is here. Seven pounds, two ounces. Mom and baby are resting. - Dad needs alcohol." - Wow! Look at that. That's incredible, isn't it? How much your life can just change in a moment? Yeah. I better go. Yeah, I have early PT in the morning. - So... - Hm. Special place, isn't it? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And once we win the case, it's gonna be even better. How so? Well I'm donating any proceeds from the lawsuit towards a... new children's wing. You'd be surprised how many little kids we get in there. You never told me that. You never asked. I'm sorry I judged you. Don't be. I judged you too. Pumpkin spice latte? Yeah. I had fun tonight. I did, too. Right? Hey. Give me a hug. - We can hug. - Right? - Yeah. - Mm-hm. You don't smell like a lawyer. Hm. Good night, Susan. Night. She's MIA. She's never MIA. First she takes yesterday off to spend time with a baby who isn't even a client and now she's late? Should we put out an amber alert? I want to see her name on buses by noon. - Is she choking? - I think that was a giggle. She sounds like I do after a second Ambien. - Hey, Susan. - There's a high pour. How are you feeling? You know? Never better. No, this is fresh. Oh! You're such a dear. Hm. Well, back to the salt mines. - I don't smell day drinking. - You can't smell vodka. - I can smell it on you. - Shut up. S. Whitaker and Associates. Hold, please. It's Bill Jones! - Oh, hey, you. - Okay. What is happening? You have this thing about knocking. Hm. Well, I appreciate your passion for your job. And I appreciate you, Roberto. Oh... Okay. - Bill Jones is on line one. - Okay. - Mr. Jones. - Ms. Whitaker. I had to let you know we're calling in a last-minute witness to trial. Arianna Silver. How did you find her? You're not the only one digging up dirt, Ms. Whitaker. We've been busy little bees. Busy looking into Nick Evans' love life. And it seems you've been getting awfully cozy with your client. Luckily, my personal life has nothing to do with this case. I wouldn't be so sure about that. You see, the love guarantee technically states, subscribers will find love via Love Guaranteed. It does not stipulate that the dates have to be arranged on the site. Only that the subscribers find love because of it. Are you still there? - Yes. - I thought so. This is your last chance to take the settlement. Otherwise this could end, well, badly for both you and your client... Seattle Lady Lawyer. Bye. Hi, you've reached Susan, please leave a message. Hey, it's Nick, you free tonight? I just got The Fugitive DVD. Uh, I'm so excited I forgot I haven't owned a DVD player in five years. Do you have a DVD player? Does anyone? Okay, call me back. - You have to talk to him. - And tell him what? That I might've sunk our case by signing up for that ridiculous site? It's only an issue if Nick finds love. Right? So... Just pump the brakes while you're working together. That's the problem, I don't want to pump the brakes. I've never not wanted to do something more. - That's wonderful! - No. No it's not! If Love Guaranteed finds out that Nick is... falling for me, they will use it against us in court. We will lose this case. He will not be able to donate any of that money to the center, and... - Okay. - Love you, sis. Hello? Where you been? I left, like, five messages for you. Just preparing for the trial. Yeah. You want some help? No, I got this. Right. Well, how does a pickup full of Pad Thai sound? You can add the leftovers to your collection. All good over here, thanks. You okay? You seem off. Just busy. You know, we're only two weeks out from our court date. Okay, uh... Let me know when you come up for air, then. Nick, I don't think that we should see each other right now. I need to focus on the case, it's my priority. Uh... Is that what you want? We can't always do what we want. Sometimes we need to do what's right. Why are you doing this? You want to win, don't you? That's what this whole case is about. It's why you hired me, isn't it? Yeah. Then let me do what I know is right for both of us, okay? Cool. I'll see you in court.

We're about to find out. There she is. Ms. Taylor! Blessings. Check out my lifestyle blog. Hi. Is that a new suit? It looks good. Let's get this show on the road. Ms. Whitaker and Mr. Evans, a moment of your time, please. Mr. Evans, how many dates have you been on? Can I have an statement, Mr. Evans? What price would you pay to find love? Almost anything, right? Well... for 29.95, which includes use of their website and app, Love Guaranteed guarantees that you will find love. All you have to do is go on a thousand dates. That's right. One thousand different dates. I went on two and a half Love Guaranteed dates, and well, that was quite enough for me, thank you. My client, Nicholas Evans, followed the rules. He went on one thousand dates. But... Love Guaranteed did not deliver on their promise. Nick Evans did not find love. Over the course of this trial, the evidence will prove that Love Guaranteed cares far more about profits than they do the well-being of their subscribers. Nicholas Evans asks that you hold Love Guaranteed responsible for their wrongful actions. Thank you. Mr. Jones, your turn. Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant stands by Love Guaranteed's brand messaging. Love is guaranteed for those truly looking for it. Now, during this trial, the defense will establish that Nick Evans had zero intention of finding love. This lawsuit isn't about trade practices or false advertising. No. It's a bargain basement gotcha lawsuit all about the money. Now, the evidence will show Nick Evans, having previously been burned by love, had no intention of finding love again. Sure, Mr. Evans may have been on a thousand dates. But the evidence will show he was just ticking them off in pursuit of a payday. So, at the conclusion of this trial, the good people of the jury will find for Love Guaranteed and dismiss all charges. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Rossmore, for the record, what is your field of expertise? Well I have a PhD in Psychology, and I teach human behavior and the sciences at the university. My specialty is attachments and relationships. Primarily the science of love. And in your professional opinion, are there any known ways to guarantee love? All the conclusions agree there is no way to predict love, much less guarantee it. No further questions. Why didn't you object? The doctor is an expert witness, there was nothing to object to. - Why do you keep hitting me? - Because you like it. No, I don't. And how did the date go? Nick asked all about me. First time that's ever happened on an internet date. Am I right, ladies? Did you ever feel like Nick was just going through the motions? - Uh... No, he was really nice. - Thank you. - Yes! - Baby girl! And how did you leave it? Nick insisted on paying the bill, walked me to my car, shook my hand good night. The perfect gentleman. Thank you for your time today. Defendant's witness. Come on. You expect us to believe Mr. Out For A Quick Buck didn't intentionally throw the date? No, like I said. Perfect gentleman. Uh-huh. Then why didn't you go out again? It's internet dating. Click and move on. That's how it goes. No, how it goes is Nick Evans had zero intention of finding love, - and he manufactured-- - Objection, Your Honor. Sustained. Actually, can I answer? Nick and I went on one date. It's impossible to say what was in his heart. But I hope he does find love one day. He deserves it. We all do. Ugh. No further questions. He's coming off like a saint in there, what is your plan? - Don't worry. - Don't touch me! Okay. Tomorrow, we're going to tear apart Nick's character and motivation by delving into his relationships. Both past and present. Look, they're coming! Ms. Taylor, can I get a statement for Rise and Shine Seattle? Yeah, it's a silly lawsuit. We are still the best dating website you can subscribe to. Check out my lifestyle blog for today's tips. No gluten, no dairy, no wheat, no sugar, no... Kicking ass, taking names, and looking fierce the entire time. Check, check, check. I don't know. I just can't let Bill Jones ruin Nick's reputation. Hm. Hold on. - Hold on? - To what? Nick! Hi. Listen, I... I have an idea. It's a little unorthodox, but... I'd like to call Arianna to the stand tomorrow. Why? She's being called either way. It's better that we manage her testimony rather than react to it. So we take the wind out of Love Guaranteed's sails. I have no way of knowing what Arianna will say. But it will show the court that you're not taking this lying down. You're an honorable guy, Nick, and that's gonna come through. Thank you. Susan... I'll see you tomorrow. ♪ That's what they say When we're together ♪ ♪ And watch how you play ♪ I hate you, Tiffany! ♪ And so we're Running just as fast as we can ♪ ♪ Holding on to one another hands ♪ Before calling Nicholas Evans to the stand, the plaintiff would like to call Ms. Arianna Silver. - Objection, that's my witness. - All right, Counsel. Come to the bench, please. You can't do this. Arianna Silver is a witness for the defense. And you will have plenty of time to cross examine. She's trying to steal my witness. All right, listen up. If Ms. Whitaker somehow thinks the defense’s witness will help her case, then she has the right to call whoever she wants. And as she pointed out, Mr. Jones, you will have your chance during cross. So yes, I'm going to allow it. Back you go. This isn't fair. Thank you, Your Honor. The plaintiff calls Ms. Arianna Silver to the stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Ms. Silver, how did you know Mr. Evans? He's my ex-fiance. And for the question on everyone's mind. What happened? I left him. For someone else. I'm getting married next month. Congratulations. To put it plainly, Ms. Silver, It is my presumption that the defense named you as a witness in hopes to reflect negatively on Mr. Evans' character. When I spoke to Mr. Jones, about being a witness, I did mention that I thought Nick was licking his wounds. I mean, a thousand dates and you couldn't find someone new? Seemed a little fishy to me. And do you still feel the same way? Actually, no. Nick is a great guy. He's all about being honest. So I assume that this lawsuit is on the up and up. I only wish him well. Thank you for your time, Ms. Silver. Defendant's witness. No questions. If there are no questions, then the witness can be excused. And we'll take a 15-minute recess before the plaintiff takes the stand. Arianna? I just want to thank you. I'm sorry how things ended with us. It's my fault. I'm not proud of it, but I did learn from it. I'm with the right person now. I'm happy for you. Mm-hm. I'm happy for you too. - What are you talking about? - I know that look. You're in love with your lawyer. Hmm... I just hope you can admit it to yourself, before it's too late. But what if she doesn't feel the same way? What if I get hurt again? There are no guarantees in love, Nick. Isn't that what this is all about? Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Mr. Evans, in your own words, please, tell the court how Love Guaranteed deceived and damaged you with their false promises. Just say whatever comes to mind. When I started this whole thing, I was out for justice. Love isn't something you can just guarantee. Like a pizza delivery. I'm sorry, what are you doing? Love is unpredictable. And it can burn you. But it can also surprise you in the most remarkable ways. It turns out I did find love, when I fell in love with my lawyer. Ms. Whitaker herself said she subscribed to Love Guaranteed. If Nick Evans is in love with her, this lawsuit has to be dismissed. Folks, we must have order in the courtroom. There's no need for dismissal, Your Honor. I'm dropping the lawsuit. Mr. Jones is right. While I didn't meet Susan through the site, I met her because of it. And I promised to tell the truth under oath, so... I'd much rather have love in my life than win here in court today. It's an amazing thing when you find someone who gets you. And you get them in return. Even when they're right and you're wrong. Turns out the saying is, "You've got another think coming." It really is, I Googled it. Weird. A wise old man once told me to dive in, so... here it goes. What I realized, that I don't want a guarantee. Or a safety net. All I want... is to take a chance with you. It's not a risk to fall in love. It's a risk not to. I love you, Susan. Do you love me too? Ms. Whitaker, answer that question. I do! I give you all the credit, I do. - You take care of her. - I will. - I'm so proud of you. - My man! - You smell like wine. - A little bit. - Ms. Whitaker? - Yes. Ms. Taylor would like a word with you. Please. Hmm. When I studied with my Lama in Tibet, he said, "The thousand brilliant accomplishments of the past do not serve today's purpose." Hmm. - I'm sorry, I'm not following. - I'll pay your legal fees, and I'll donate 250 thousand to your hospital, if you two become the new face of Love Guaranteed. Hm... - Why would you do that? - An old-fashioned love story complete with a romantic courtroom confession? People love that crap. I mean... It's gonna make me look so good on social media. It's not hard... It's much better than the fake poster couple we have now. I knew it! Brad and Veronica. - He did, he called that. Hm-- - I called that. Two hundred and fifty thousand for the hospital. That's a lot, but we were seeking a million in damages. And let's face it, we could've had it, so... But you didn't. - We could've though. - How about 500 thousand? Deal. Wow. The jury still out on whether a dating site can guarantee love. But love guarantees a happy ending. So what do we do now?
