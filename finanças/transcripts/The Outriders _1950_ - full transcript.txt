Ripped, corrected & synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! Alright, you rebels! Fall in! Get in them ranks, men. Hurry it up! Attention! Southern gentlemen, officers, troopers... I want you men to have all your blankets and all your clothing and be ready to march by noon. No, you're not leaving us yet, not permanently. You're just going for a little walk. The smallpox has broken out up on the hill. Up in Benton, they say it comes from down here. They say this camp is a pest hole, and all you southern gentlemen brought the disease with you from Dixie, so we're gonna see what we can do about giving you a bath. - Take over, Lieutenant. - Yeah. - ♪ Jolly red, hey - Jolly red, hey ♪ ♪ Jolly red, ho Jolly red, hey ♪ ♪ If you wanna have a good time Join the calvary ♪ ♪ Join the calvary Join the calvary ♪ ♪ If you wanna have a good time Join the calvary ♪ ♪ Join it, hey ♪ ♪ If you wanna have a good time Join the calvary ♪ ♪ Join the calvary Join the calvary ♪ This is my first detail as a wet nurse. And, by hooker, I'm gonna see it's a good one. You may find a little ice still in the water, but don't let that bother you. Get in there and scrub, clothes and all. When you get through with your clothes, start on your hides. The water won't take the dirt off, scrape it off. And if that won't work, we'll see what a good cuttin' edge will do. Alright, Rebs, in! Yeah! A bath a year. If they don't watch out, they'll spoil us. A year at Benton don't wash off easy. Yeah. You boys still hankerin' to go home? Yeah, you gonna fix it for us? I might. I just might. Hey. Come on in, Yank. Plenty of room. Couldn't take the chance, the Sergeant'd chew me good. Just being neighborly. Sure, Reb... after the war. Hold it, Rebs. That's far enough. Now get back, go on. Get back. That's enough, Jesse. That's enough. I just wanted to make sure. You hear what I hear? Hounds. We'll try and work our way back to our own lines, find our old outfits. Not me. They'll be a whole new generation grown up to take my place. I want to get back to New Orleans and into a white linen suit again. It's gettin' dark. We ought to get started. I feels busted. Ugh. I reckon it's the kidneys again. Let's start. Neighborly to leave us a change. We got a night's walkin' to do. Must be cookin' breakfast. Breakfast. Yeah. I move we chance askin' her for some. Come on. Bad news from Centralia. Why, ain't you heard about it? No, we've been out west, mining. Oh. You didn't tell me that. No, I didn't. There was a raid. Some of Quantrell's bushwhackers came over the bluff in the morning and spent the day looting. Every man in Centralia dead. They didn't leave one. The bloody-handed Amalekites. You can't call it war. It's one of the soldier towns, didn't have a garrison of over 15 men. It was murder! Vengeance is mine, said the Lord. Vengeance is mine, and I will repay. I got two brothers with Grant, and if it goes on any longer, it'll be three. How come you men ain't in uniform? You tell him, Will. I took a Minié ball at Pittsburgh Landing. They can't use me anymore. I got it early too. Wanna see the mark? No. Well, you done what you could. What do you think about the escape at Benton? Benton? Oh, you wouldn't know about that either comin' from the West. Three Rebels broke outta the stockade and killed a guard. Heard it in town last night that a posse chased 'em down this way. Where'd you say you was when you got hit? Pittsburgh Landing. Anything wrong with that? No, nothin'. Nothin' at all. Leaving us? Uh, got to feed the hogs. Something's wrong. Where did he go? Vengeance is mine. Where did he go? Don't! Pa's halfway to town by now. Why? What does he know? It was him. Only Rebels would call it Pittsburgh Landing. Around here, we call it Shiloh. Clint, get all the guns in the house. Get some food. Come on, Jesse. Get the horses. Will! Come on, Will. You alright, Clint? Yeah, I'm alright. Leave him, Will. Come on. It's too late now. We've lost our lead. Get off! Get off! Come on! That's trigger-thinkin', boy. Yeah. Real trigger. How about a drink of water? Better make it a long one, farmer. They don't look like soldiers. Must be irregulars. What's the difference? They Yanks, and we ain't. I'm Keeley. Keeley. I ride with Quantrell. What? Quantrell. Jesse Wallace, cannoneer, New Orleans Light Artillery. Clint Priest, militiaman, North Carolina volunteers. Sergeant Will Owen, Hood's Texans. After that, I spent a little time in Mexico in the Southwest. When I heard the war started, I joined up with Hood in Texas. How much time did you spend out west? A couple of years. Mining? Some, trapping too, a little of everything. You know Santa Fe? I been there. You. You talk like a gentlemen. You've been fightin' in a fancy outfit. How come you're only a foot soldier? You're an officer, you've got to answer for your men. Like this, I answer to myself. Makes war less complicated. What's your story, dad? I joined up right after Sumter. Alright. Here's where I stand. I've been with Quantrell all the way. At the beginning, we went to Richmond and asked for commissions, but they don't approve of us. They don't like our idea of burnin' 'em out and wipin' 'em out. They like to take their tactics from books. We rode into Centralia a while back. We didn't use no book. We heard about that. A raider's a man, who kills instead of captures. He's a free agent. He depends on himself for pay. And he fights. Or fights because he wants to hurt somebody. You men'll never make it back to your regiments. You wanna throw in with me? Count me in. What about you? You're fightin' 'em, ain't you? You? I don't know. I give you some time to think about it. About 20 minutes. While your friend's thinkin'. Tell him we'll be thinkin' too. Tell him we'll be thinking we don't like the idea of strangers leaving our camp knowing where it is. It'll be a lot better for us to give him a military burial than to leave him loose for the Yankees to find. Will, have you gone crazy? You losing your mind? Keeley means what he says. Nobody stands in his way. He gets what he wants. When they sing out the name "Keeley," people jump. Keeley's a murderer and a looter. He said himself he had no right to that coat he's wearing. Yeah, and he'll murder you if you don't thrown in with him. He butchered a town of unarmed civilians. You're gettin' to be a real Yankee-lover, Will. Is that what a year in Benton did to you? Or maybe you just lost your belly for fightin' there. Hold it, you roosters. Jesse makes sense, Will. Keeley's fightin' for the cause too. Maybe you don't hold with the way he's fightin', but it's the only way left for us. My boy was killed the first time the guns went off. Wasn't nobody but me to take up for him. There ain't nobody but me to fight till the fighting's over. - Here comes Keeley. - Here comes Keeley. What happened? Federals. When? About five days ago. What happened to Harrison and Boon? Yankee patrol got both of 'em. How close were you to Santa Fe? The bluff. The bluff? You mean to say you only went 150 miles in more than four days? We got lost looking for Lost Spring. Lost... Listen. Sometime next month, a man named Don Antonio Chaves is leaving Santa Fe with a few wagons and an armed guard. He'll be makin' for the Federal Treasury in St. Louis. He'll be carrying a million dollars in gold bullions from the Mexican mines. Union Detachment in Santa Fe can't spare any blue-bellied soldiers to convoy him. So he'll be goin' as a merchant train, with the gold hidden under his freight. Quantrell's told me to take it. And now you're tellin' us. Now I'm tellin' you, 'cause you're the only man in this camp that knows the Southwest. Quantrell needs that gold, and we're gonna get it for him. We're gonna get it for the Confederacy. What's your plan? You three'll travel to Santa Fe, now, today. Boy, you ride along with 'em. Come back and tell me what day the wagons pull out. You lead 'em right back here to Cow Creek. Get 'em bedded down with sweet water and green feed for their animals. Then, when they're good and bedded down, we'll come and visit 'em. You mean you bushwhack 'em in their sleep. Yeah, I'll bushwhack 'em right enough, and you'll help me do it. You know as well as I do how things are going up at Richmond. You know that a million in hard gold means 10,000,000 more Confederate credit. That's why you'll help me! If a man wanted to see Santa Fe and he was in a hurry, what route would he take? Go up the Arkansas to Ash Creek. Turn at Pawnee Fork and make for the Cimarron. Up the river to Cold Spring, then 80 miles west. From McNess Creek to Round Mound, then to Point of Rocks, 45 miles to Sandy Bluff. After that, Medicine Hat and Hyena's Peak. Due west to the Rio Colorado, then cut south to White Springs, then Poison Creek. Another day to Ocate, then to Rio Gallinas, Ojo de Bernal, from there to White Hill. Next stop, San Miguel. Is that right, Will? Drinking their coffee out of silver mugs? Even the bowls they use for washing made of silver? Silver mugs? Why man, there's a fandango every night. And the nights are hot. The women wear thin, white blouses and red skirts. It's been a long time since I saw a dancin' woman. It'll be three days more. Three days. Me, I kind of relish gettin' old. It takes the bother out of living. Santa Fe, let me at it! Man, look at them church steeples. Beat anything I ever seen. It's no New Orleans, but it'll have to do. Real silver for buttons. You two get cleaned up and stay inside. Don't talk to anybody. I'll be in bed. Don't rouse me unless Sherman's comin' into Santa Fe. You want me, I'll be in the bar. Stay out. Will, we've come a long way. It's a long way back. Stay out. Give a man a horn and he'll blow it. Stay on, Jesse. Will, where we going? We just go in. Let's relax, boy. We're headin' straight for Chaves. I wanna find out when he leaves. You're jumpy, Will. Yeah. Let's keep moving. What're you gonna say, Will? Shouldn't be hard. Travelers on the loose always join trains for protection. Ha, ha. He's gonna protect us? Wait here, please. I can only catch a few words. She's begging to go along. I hope she talks him into it. Looks like real nice company for a long wagon ride. Pulling out tomorrow at sunup. She wants to take a child with her. What can I do for you? My name is Will Owen, and this is Jesse Wallace. Antonio Chaves, a sus órdenes. There's a third man riding with us. We'd like to join your wagons. We figured we might make ourselves useful. Ha, ha. Everybody wants to join my wagons. I don't mean to wish to seem inhospitable. The Apache are usually out looking for horses this time of year. We're riding good ones. We'd appreciate some company. Where do you come from? Chihuahua in the south. We heard you're headin' for St. Louis. I'm sorry,señores,but I have no real need for your services. I'm taking only a cargo of hides and a smallcaballada, a herd of ponies to sell in the States. Like he said, the Apaches have an eye for ponies. We're carrying rifles. We know how to use 'em. Ha, ha. Please forgive my impoliteness, but I must forego your company. And now if you'll excuse me, I have business. Mr. Chaves, forgive our impoliteness, but you could use three more outriders. The Indians-- If you ride east, you'll ride by yourselves. I trust you'll have a pleasant journey and arrive home in good health. The trail is a wide one. Please give my wagons plenty of room. If you come within 200 yards, we'll fire on you. Three Conestoga's, two open wagons, a stagecoach, a carriage and a chuck wagon. Yeah. They're hauling with mules instead of oxen too. Looks like one man to each carriage and wagon, three or four outriders, the rest of 'em are wrangling the ponies. A priest. Looks like a sick man. Looks like the lady won her point. She must be a widow. She's wearin' black. Don't see the child she was talking about. Unless it's that boy. If he is, she birthed him when she was five. Where do you think they're carryin' the gold? Right under your nose in them open wagons. Can't you see they're haulin' with four mules instead of two? They're camped down for the night. Suppose the Don don't go by way of Cow Creek. That ain't gonna be good. We'll have to let Keeley know which way he does go. He'll bushwhack him someplace else. Yeah, then at the first shot, the Don will have his wagons down in a barricade. And then it won't be an ambush anymore. They'll have a fight for their lives. I like it better that way. Me too. I never shot from behind yet. Puts me in mind of Vicksburg. It's only thunder. Yeah, I know it is, but it makes me think of the big guns. Big guns and small arms. Let's go see. Jesse, Clint and me, maybe we can drive 'em off. If we do, Chaves should be real glad to see us. You lay back here, and see if we make it. If we do, you light out for Keeley. Here's your route. They're attackin' on foot. Make for their ponies. They think we're trying to scatter 'em, they'll break to save 'em. Kick up lots of dust, so they won't know how many we are. Mr. Owen. My thanks and my apologies. We had to be cautious. You were strangers. We're still strangers. This is Father Damasco, Mr. Owen. I'm taking him east. There is something eating at his belly. It causes him great pain. No doctor in Santa Fe can help him. It's your wagon train. With four men gone, the Indians are bound to come again. Mr. Owen, I can use your rifles now. If we join you now, we take on your risk. I know. We can make a bargain. I know this country. I'll take you through it. Very well. Climb down, boys. We're joining up. Camp here tonight. - Camp here. - Camp here. - Camp here. - Officer Owen. No sign of them today, yeah? None. Perhaps you'll do me the honor of dining with us tonight. Thanks. I have to post the guard. Oh, uh, well, Mrs. Gort will have some food for you when you get back. You're making a mistake, Will. He eats better than we do. One of these nights, we'll be leading him into Cow Creek. Won't make it any easier to know his life story. I wouldn't mind knowin' hers. Help you, ma'am? For you. Don Antonio sent them. And you bring them. Thank you. Eat it while it's hot. Thank you kindly, ma'am. Having a nice trip? I'd never slept out before this. It's nothing. It all depends on the company you keep. Roy's my company. You've got a big boy there. Almost big enough to be in uniform. Roy isn't my boy. He's my husband's brother. I have no children. Oh. Going to meet your husband? Major Gort is dead. He was killed in the war. I didn't know there was fighting this far west. There was enough. Then you haven't got anybody to look after you. She's got me. I thought you were asleep. No, I wasn't. They won't come back again tonight. The Indians, will they? I'm not scared of the Apaches. A woman and a young boy. Did you have to take him away from home? I'm taking him home to his brother's people in Ohio. I'll walk you back. We can find our way. Say, Will? Yeah. How many nights do you figure it'll take us to reach Cow Creek? I was only askin'. What're you doing up here? It's too cramped in the coach. Don Antonio said I could ride if I wanted to. You picked yourself a good spot to see the show. If there are Indians, we'll be the first to see 'em. You think there'll be any? We're pullin' out of Apache country. Sure, but the Comanches come next. The Pawnees after them. The Pawnees are the worst. Maybe it's the way they eat that makes 'em so mean. They yank the liver out of a buffalo while it's still breathing and down it raw. Their idea of real pleasure is to spread the gall over the top to make a sauce. Lay off, Jesse. He gets it all out of books. Sure, but the man who wrote the book saw it. I wanted to ask you. Could I take my turn at guard tonight? I suppose you can if you want to. I want to. Looks like rain. The ponies'll be restless. It's looked that way for the past three days. Just the same, you'd better sing to 'em tonight. Ready? Yes, I am. Haven't you enough men for guards. Do you have to use a boy? I asked him. I'm sure Mr. Owen will understand-- Jen. Alright. I'm sorry. What are we waiting for? Come on. This is your position. Just sit tight and keep your eyes open. Where will you be? Right over there within gunshot. You alright? I ain't scared. You'd better put that poncho on. Was that you, Will? What do you mean? I thought I heard a noise. That was the rain, the horses stirring around. That was your noise. I figured maybe we're in trouble. No. You'd better get back now, Roy. Come on. Who fired that shot? We'd like to know. Wait a minute. I will ask Mr. Owen. Mr. Owen. The men want to know who fired the shot. I did. I thought I saw something. You, Mr. Owen? I'm the one that fired the shot. Alright, Will. You fired the shot. We pull out in half an hour. We need sleep. We've been at it all night. The Pawnees don't sleep. Half an hour. Half an hour, men. Half an hour. Mr. Owen. I want to thank you. Thank me for what? It was Roy. He told me he fired the shot. Keep him in the carriage with you from now on. I'll be getting back now. Fine-looking woman. Yeah. That's why you're makin' your move fast. Taking the blame for the boy. That was smart. Puts you in good with her. First thing I know, you'll be beatin' my time. Stay away from her, Jesse. Don't talk like that, Will. All you'll do is drive me right into her arms. I said, "Stay away." We've been together for a long time, you and me, blanket mates. It's been share and share alike, but you wanna know something? Tell me. It's all over. Jesse, I'm gonna flood the prairies and wash out gullies with my tears. It'll rain wholesale. Sure. I thought you were the mule skinner. Can't you keep them from balking? They're all in from last night. They don't wanna go. Well, they gotta go! Keep 'em moving. Mr. Owen. Mr. Owen, I have a suggestion. What is it? It is within your jurisdiction, but the men are tired. Why don't you make it a short day? We're in Pawnee country. We gotta get out of it. Is it only the Indians who drive you, Mr. Owen? Hold it! Hold it. We got company. He says he wants some calico. He's changed his mind now. He wants ten ponies. What does he want now? The same thing he wanted in the first place. All the ponies. If I put a bullet in this old hyena, we'll have to fight 'em. We might be able to drive 'em off, but if we don't... Whatever you say, Mr. Owen. We've still got three hours of daylight left. Move. We could afford them. The men are talkin', Will. What they got on their minds? They're sayin' they could have fought off the Pawnees, only you chickened on 'em. And they're talking about last night's roundup. They've got a taste of the rain and eight hours of hard riding fixed good in their heads, and they're saying that you give all that hard work away to a scabby Indian who would have run if you'd said "boo." What do you think about it, Clint? Me? Yeah. Well, Will, I reckon you had your reasons. It ain't easy to be in command. I always did feel sorry for the general when I was in the line. Good evening. Hello, Mr. Owen. I need some drinkin' liquor. - Have a hard day? - Let me get the mug. I want all you've got. Oh, that's a large thirst you have. I don't want it for myself, it's for the men. They need something to lift them up. You shall have it. How are you feeling, father? Much better, Mr. Owen. And you? Can't be very easy riding on that litter. We'll be in St. Louis soon. That's right. It won't be long now. Aguardiente. I would suggest you mix it with water. Thanks. You won't get much sleep tonight. Stay in the stagecoach till sunup. And keep those blinds pulled.

You're backslidin', Will. Am I? Yeah. You're beginnin' to figure about how to keep her alive at Cow Creek. You know something? Keeley should have made me top man. I'd never let a woman come between me and the cause. Especially a dead woman. You're a good man, Will. You want to take over, it'll have to be with a gun. Yeah, I know that. You'll take a new position down back of the train riding trail. I want to make sure you don't fall a little behind me out in the point when we're alone. The time is past when I can show you my back. Goodnight, Will. Goodnight, Jesse. Flood time. Real high over the banks. I've never seen it like this before. Better bed down here for the night. Take a look at it in the morning. We'll camp here! She ain't dropped none. If anything, she's up a little. We're losin' time, Will. And we ain't got none to spare. Keeley can't chance it more than two days out in the open waitin' for us at Cow Creek. You can blame the river if we don't get there on time. They need that gold up in Richmond, Will. I've given up for four years. It's enough. I've done my share. She'll be alive. They'll all be alive, and it'll be the river's doing, not ours. I reckon we done all we could. I can't say I'm sorry, boy. What do you think, Mr. Owen? We'll have to wait till she lowers before we can make a fording. Thought you were in a hurry. Your friend, the priest, he don't look like he's got many days to waste. I cannot risk my other people and my wagons. Not with a current like this. When I was in the artillery, we snaked cannon heavier than your wagons across streams stronger than this. And we didn't wait for a fording either. The trick is to make the current work for you instead of against you and build a raft. You heard him. He said he can't take the risk. There is no risk. Look. Here's your river. The current runs this way. You work a light line across and then a heavy rope. You hitch it up to a tree on a far bank. Up here. The near end of your rope holds your raft. Right here. You load her up and turn her loose. Downstream current swings her across like the pendulum on a clock. And how are you going to get the raft back? Same thing. You have a return line on your side of the river, hitched to a tree. How do you get the line across in the first place, Jesse? Swimming? You know I can't swim, Will. Split the men into two work parties. Have one of them fell some trees for a 25-foot raft. The others can start by cutting the mules out. Go away! Come on, get to this. All set? Ready! Alright, men. Steady on it! Steady, there. Take it easy! That was close. What's the difference? It wouldn't be much of a loss. It's only a load of hides. That's right. - There she comes! - Keep her rolling now. Look out for the log! Jump! Jump! There goes our raft! And a chuck wagon! Look out for that current! There goes the raft! Yeah, that way! You lucky boy! You men will have to chance it. Come across on your horses like I did. Turn the other animals loose. The boy! I'm going for him. Stay where you are! Mr. Owen is coming to help you! Don't let him! You can't stop him now. Ah! Roy! Swim! Swim! - He can't swim! - The current's got him! Roy! Roy! Mr. Owen. He's gone. Will, he's gone. He's gone. He's alone in the water. I know. I know. He wouldn't wait for you to come and help him. He wouldn't wait. He was trying to be a man. He wanted to be brave like the major. Brave like the major. The major ran away when the shelling started. He ran behind the lines and tried to bury himself in the sand. When it was over, his own men came after him, put him against the wall, and shot him. Everybody in Santa Fe knew about it. Roy couldn't live with it any longer. I had to take him away. I took him part of the way. The river took him the rest. You've got to let the dead stay dead. I know. I know. Well, you done all you could, Will. Ain't nothing more you can do. You gotta go through with it. You think I will? I don't know, boy. You're in love with her, Will. And it's tearing you apart. You think even the gold isn't worth it. Even the confederacy. You want to go to Chaves and tell him. Call it off. Don't do it, Will. What is it? We pull into Cow Creek tomorrow night. We bed down there. I want you to stay near me. Something's wrong, isn't it? Just do like I say. Stay near me, that's all. I'll stay near you. Get up! Take it easy, boy. I'm going ahead to patrol. Howdy. Riding alone? Bringing in a train. So am I. Anything up ahead? No. Nothing doing at Cow Creek? Didn't notice nothing. How far did you come? Santa Fe. Hey! Santa Fe! That case, maybe you ain't heard the news yet. What news? The war news. You going to keep it a secret? Couldn't if I wanted to. And I don't want to. I like to watch people's faces when I tell them. Alright. Watch mine. Well, the war is over. What? Well, it happened at Appomattox. Lee and Grant come face to face, and Lee says how he can't go on no more. They say Grant must've been a farmer himself because he let them keep their mouths. That ain't all! Hey! Hey! The war is over! The war is over! The war is over! Too bad we used all the brandy. We didn't. I'll be right back. We came close. Boys, I'll tell you, I'm gettin' older, but I've still got a few days and nights left if I keep my feet dry. And them nights was beginnin' to bother me. A man's awful alone at night. You better head for Keeley. There's a chance he hasn't heard. He doesn't mix with people. We don't want this train bushwhacked by mistake. Better start now. Wait a minute. Why? The war is over, killing is over. This killing is over. No, it isn't, Will. You didn't think Keeley was gonna let that million dollars go to Richmond, did you? Keeley isn't a soldier, Will. He's a bandit. So were you. So were Clint and me. He's real smart, if you look at it. Keeley was playing it safe, hiding behind the flag. Now, there isn't any flag. You knew it all along. Will, you were all South. Keeley needed you bad because you knew the West, but he couldn't tell you why. He could tell me. We talked it over, and we decided-- You decided I'd bring the train through, and then you'd tell me. Then you'd give me my share, is that right? Sixty thousand dollars, Will. Maybe more. Will, you were raised poor. Think what that means. Did you talk it over with Keeley, Clint? No, I didn't, Will. In that case, take his gun. Was there a share for me too, Jesse? Yeah, for you too, Clint. I'll bet there was, right out of this barrel. I hope your pants are tight, Clint. They're tight enough, boy. Take off your belt and tie his hands behind him. What-- Tell 'em, Jesse. You tell 'em. This is your idea. There's a bushwhacking party waitin' for you at Cow Creek. They'll wipe you out. How do you know? He ought to know. He led you into it. All the way from Santa Fe. You led us 800 miles into a trap, and now you tell us about it before it's sprung. Why? There's no time to explain now. Keeley would have had pickets out for 20 miles back. They're scouting us right now. What do you suggest? Head for Cow Creek, anyhow. We'll have water at our backs. We'll make a stand. We can fight them off. Suppose we turn around. Double back on our trail? I tell you we've been seen. He'll be after us. They have fast mounts. We have wagons. I shall be riding directly behind you. You've made yourself a deal. Hitch up those teams! We'll leave the carriage behind. Move fast. Ready? Ready. After you, Mr. Owen. Let's go! They're cutting us off at the creek! We'll have to make a stand! Now it's up to them. What was their plan? It wasn't supposed to begin till tonight, when everyone was asleep. Keeley isn't expecting a fight. He's thinking it over. Over there! I'm coming across under a flag of truce! At your own risk! Come along. That's far enough. Not one more step. Mr. Will Owen. Don Antonio Chaves. You see, we've got you numbered. But that ain't the point. I want your gold. And you want your lives. We can arrange it peaceable. No bloodletting either way. Don't come any closer, I said. Why not be reasonable? It won't hurt to talk it over, civilized. The gold will go back to his family, who have no need for it. Their need was for him. So was ours. So Keeley was gonna bushwhack Chaves. Don Antonio should have let him finish his remarks. Keeley had his mouth open like a gulf-oyster at low tide. Don't mourn him too long. I won't. This means a bigger share for everybody else. Everybody except you. Don't you figure on collecting. I'll collect alright. Not with your hands tied, you won't. They'll be able to untie me. You won't be here to meet 'em. I'd still collect and you'd still be alive if I spoke a word for you when they came. They'll try it again, that's sure. They'll probably wait till dark. Then come down fast. Maybe we could split up. Outflank them, take 'em in the crossfire. Might be. A man could work down that draw, up around the hill behind them without being seen. - Hold your fire, boys. - It's Will coming back. Find anything? Yeah. I found a place that might work. We'll start as soon as it's dark. Jesse. Yeah. I don't know how he got the knife, but he got it. Must've slipped across to join them. And he'll be bringin' 'em back in about an hour. Hey, Will! Give my love to the lady! Tell her I'm coming calling! Come on. Once they start, we'll only have about two minutes. See 'em? Now! Come on! We're going after 'em! Is that you, Jesse? Leave him to me. Yeah, it's me, alright. If I'd known it was you, I'd given the first shot. Would you, Jesse? You shot my belly out, Will. You haven't got a drink on you, have you, Will? I sure could use a drink. How many shots you got left, Jesse? Not a one, boy. Sorry. Thanks, Jesse. That's all I wanted to hear. He said he was out of bullets. -- English --
