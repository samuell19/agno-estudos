(MultiCom Jingle) - No! (static crackling) - Look at America, a sea of violence and bloodshed. Oh, we blame it on declining morality and television, the movies. You know what? We're right. For all the wrong reasons. - No! No! (static crackling) - We need to offer a real outlet for those dark impulses. Television tries and pretends to understand. But like that pretty girl that only wants to hold hands. It's nice. But face facts. We just wanna fuck! (Carmel groaning) - No! (static crackling) - Real death is one of the only things that has any impact on our tired, over-sophisticated nervous systems. We need to feel that age-old rush of adrenaline as we fight for our lives, knowing that one mistake could end it all on the fly.

(dramatic music) Go to seven and four. (dramatic music) (static crackling) Alright, let's get this over with. On air in five, four, three, two, one. Here we go. - [Announcer] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to No Exit. This is the start of a brand new tournament featuring the master of mayhem, the current champion, Darcona. - [Dave] Hank, give me camera five, now! - [Hank] I got it. - [Dave] Alright, camera three, stay with it, stay with it. Get me camera two, bring up two. (dramatic music) - The service is simple, Mr. Chang. You subscribe to the channel. We deliver the box that unscrambles the signal. When we're ready to go to air, we call you one hour ahead of time. (dramatic music) - [Dave] Move to the right, move in closer! Camera two, goddamit, move in camera two! - Yes, a million dollars is a lot of money, but we provide superior entertainment value. (grunting) - Goddamit camera five, on Darcona, now now now! Oh shit, I missed the whole damn thing! - I'm fucking trying here. - Yes, always to the death. We guarantee it. (grunting) We've just begun a new tournament. Eight days of nonstop action. - Camera three, tighter on Darcona. (grunting) - We operate out of an old mining compound in the Arctic. We bought it through a corporate shell from the Canadian government. - [Dave] Okay camera five, stay on him, stay tight, stay tight. Camera three, don't lose him. (screaming) - No discounts, no money back, no guarantees. It's the nature of the beast, Mr. Chang. After all, all our competitions are to the death. (grunting) - [Dave] Stay on him, don't lose him. Fan-fucking-tastic. Alright, stay close, follow the hand. Alright, now to his face. - Yeah! - I'll have a man there tomorrow, and you'll have the money for me? - [Chang] Yes. - Excellent, Mr. Chang. - [Dave] And cutting feed. Three, two, one. - Yeah! (static crackling) - [Armstrong] Mr. Hakeem? - [Hakeem] Yes. - [Armstrong] No Exit. Houston Armstrong. I understand you were interested in the quality of our competitors. - [Hakeem] Are they good? - Of course we offer nothing but the highest caliber professionals. (gun firing) (grunting) We comb the planet looking for just the right people to appear on No Exit. My recruiters work 24 hours a day. (phone ringing) Armstrong. - We got him. - How was he? - Strong, fast, everything a world champion kickboxer should be. An excellent choice sir. He'll make a fine competitor. - Fine. Bring him to me, Mr. Tayback. - We're traveling sir. (static crackling) (dramatic music) - Hello? Is anyone here? Ethics and Application? Got the right class. - [John] How much money you got on you, rich boy? - [Jason] Excuse me? - I said rich boy, how much money you got on you. - [Jason] Who the hell are you? - Nice clothes, clean cut. I figured a hundred bucks on you easy, maybe two hundred. Listen to me, you don't wanna do this. - And why's that, rich boy? - Because I'm a third degree black belt in Taekwondo. - Is that so, rich boy? You think you're gonna kick the shit outta me, huh? You think you're tough? What if I don't give a shit if you're tough huh? What if I'm just gonna rip your nose right off that schoolboy chickenshit face of yours? - I told you, I'm a third degree black belt in Taekwondo. - Yeah yeah, you're Bruce Fucking Lee. (shouts) Listen, Mr. Lee. I don't believe you. I think you're full of shit. I think you're nothing but a rich college fucking jewboy. - What did you call me? - Well I'll be. You are, aren't you? You're a Jew. Fuck, this is my lucky day, huh? You gotta whole lot more than a hundred bucks on you, don't you. Huh? - I'm a third degree black belt in Taekwondo. I am warning you not to pursue this course of action. - You're nothing but a chickenshit Jew. Boy, this is gonna be fun. I'm gonna stomp you all over this classroom. You're gonna be nothing but a stain on the floor when I'm done with you, just a little stain for your little Jew friends. - Why don't you get the fuck out of here before I break your neck? - You don't got the balls. Come on, you fucking kyke, let's see what you're made of, come on, 'cause I'm gonna kick the shit out of you. - My name is Jason Samuels. I'm a third degree black belt in Taekwondo. If you attack me, I will defend myself. I have given you due warning. - Warning? You're warning me? You fucking kyke. The fuck do you think you are, huh, huh? (dramatic music) Turn on the lights. The words I've just spoken are words of hate, fear, and cowardice, words never to be spoken, prompted by emotions never to be felt. - Mr. Samuels showed amazing restraint. He should have kicked your ass professor. - I'll keep that in mind when I'm grading your thesis, Miss Buckles. Jason, I'm sorry to have to put you through that, but that's what this course is all about. I'm John Stoneman. - Professor. - Violence is never excusable. At times in extreme cases, it may become necessary. But violence is always unfortunate, always regrettable, and always the last resort. This course, Ethics and Physical Application, is devoted to finding the way of the peaceful warrior, to embracing the spirit of warriorism while remaining passive in the face of aggression. Jason, you did an excellent job today in not falling prey to either my aggression or your own. Over the next 30 weeks, you'll all be expected to deliver a paper a week while completing a major exam at the end of the year. And in addition, there'll be training sessions every other day. Yes, I'm a tough professor. Yes, the work load is heavy. But at the end of this course, those of you who work very hard will have attained their master's degree and mastered their mind and their body. Chapters one through four of Jenet to be read for tomorrow. Chapters, not pages everyone. Good first day, don't forget about the homework. See you tomorrow, good night. Jason, Jason. Can I speak to you for a minute? - Sure professor. - I hope you understand why I couldn't let you know about what was gonna happen today. - I understand, Professor. - I want to apologize for any pain or embarrassment that my words may have caused you. - That's okay. But you know, I would've kicked your butt, Professor. - Maybe. (laughing) It's been a long time since I've had a serious confrontation, so it's possible. - You hold three 10th degree black belts, don't you? - Three? Why, I seem to have more every day. (laughing) Good day today, I'm very proud of you. - Thanks a lot, Professor. - Thank you, Jason. - Excuse me, Professor Stoneman. - Mmhmm? - I'd like to talk to you about something. - Um, what would you like to talk to me about... Professor Stoneman? How was class? - It was great. - No headaches? - Uh-uh. - You sure. - Mmhm. - Promise? - I will stop teaching when I feel the strain, promise. Who was today's victim? - Jason Samuels. - And? - And he's gonna be a very good student. How's Einstein? - I hope you know this baby's not gonna be named Einstein. I'm not kidding. - Don't we have a doctor's appointment? - (laughs) I'm serious! - [John] I know you are. - [Doctor] The amniocentesis is good, very good. - Oh good, I'm glad. What about their heartbeat? - Normal. - So everything's developing well, right? - Mmhm. Just fine. I know you're both anxious about the baby and it's understandable considering the difficulty that you've had conceiving and Carmel, your two miscarriages, but mother and baby are healthy. However, in light of your previous history, it would be wise to avoid any serious stress and keep away from any strenuous physical activity. Other than that. - Is there anything I can do? - Yeah, take good care of Carmel, and stop worrying, you're gonna be a dad soon enough. - So there's no problem, right? - Well, my card is making that pinging noise again, but other than that, no. (laughing) Carmel, would you take this man home and give him a glass of wine, make him relax? Doctor's orders, huh? - Thank you. Well. Ah, feel better? I do, love you. - I think I'll take the doctor's advice, go home, have a glass of wine, relax. - Oh good, you're still here. It's for you. - What is it? - Well just in case you wanna know what color to paint the baby's room. - Well hold on a sec, you mean, you know if it's a boy or a girl? - So do you, if you want. See you in a week Carmel. - Thank you. - Bye Doc. - Bye John. - [John] You see the practical person wants to know the sex of the child, because then they know what color to paint the room, what kind of toys to get, whereas the impractical person person goes for the surprise. I don't know, I just. - [Carmel] What are we? Do we want to open the envelope? - Do you, huh? - I don't know. Do you? Do you want to know what the sex of our child is? - You know, we've wanted this baby for a long time. It doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl. - That's true. - Waiting a couple more months won't kill us. - That's true. - But (laughs). - But. - What if Einstein's a girl, though? (laughing) - Well. - You sure? - (laughs) Yes. - You know, I've got a confession to make. The first time I saw you strolling across the campus in Paris, I wanted to ask you out right there and then. - Why didn't you? - I couldn't speak French. - (laughs) You're so silly. - Thank you for making me the happiest man in the whole wide world. Thank you. Mmm. - Wallet. - Got that. - Keys. - Got that. - Credit card. Be right back. - What am I gonna do with you, Professor? - [John] Love me forever. Be right back. - Okay. (laughing) (slow, dramatic music) No! No! No, no! (slow, dramatic music) (low-pitched laughing) (footsteps splashing) (low-pitched laughing) (keys tinkling) (Carmel gasps) (low-pitched laughing) (Carmel screaming) - [Thug] Ma'am, are you down here all by yourself? - [Thug] Come on, baby! - [Thug] It's not too safe for you to be down here, ma'am. Are you down here all. (slow, dramatic music) (laughing) Are you down here all alone? Huh! - John! (horn honking) (thugs yelling) Get away! (thugs yelling) - [Thug] I wouldn't start that car. I wouldn't start that car! (glass shattering) (thugs laughing) (horn honking) - [Carmel] No! John! No! John! Help me, no! No! John! Help me, no! John! Help me, no! - No! Okay, alright, okay. - John, no! - [Thug] You want her? - John! John! - [John] What would you like? - [Thug In Bandanda] You want to buy her? He wants to buy her! (thugs laughing) Rich guy like you? - John! - Shut the fuck up! - [Thug In Bandana] You got 10,000? - I've got money, you want money? - Yeah, we'll take 10,000 for the bitch. - Alright, take my money. - [Thug In Bandana] What have you got here? - That's what you want, take my money. - [Thug In Bandana] What have you got here? - John, help me! - [Thug In Bandana] You got shit in here! (thugs yelling) - [Thug] Take him out, come on! - Are you an angry man? Violence is not the answer. Just let her go. Hey, listen. Now that is not the answer. Fuck this, man, just let her go. Let's get the fuck out of here! - [Thug In Hat] Cheap motherfucker, get the fuck out of here! - Please let her go, she's a pregnant woman. Please have some compassion. - [Thug In Hat] You want the girl, you gotta get by me first. - It's my wife. - [Carmel] John! - [John] You walk away from this now, and nobody gets hurt. - [Thug In Hat] Fuck you man! - Alright. You wish to follow this course of action, I think it's only fair to warn you that I'm a 10th degree black belt in various martial arts. - Black belt this, motherfucker! - [Carmel] John! (grunting) Help! John! - Shut the fuck up! - [Carmel] Let me go! - [Thug With Knife] Shut up! - Violence is not the answer. This is not what it takes to be a man. Drop the knife and let her go and we all walk away. - Bullshit. - Put the knife down and nobody gets hurt. We all walk away, okay? - You want her? You can have her! (grunting) (screaming) - No! (Carmel groaning) (grunting) (low-pitched grunting) Carmel! (static crackling) (tense, dramatic music) - John, what happened? - She was attacked in the parking garage. - She's hemorrhaging. - Vital signs? - Weak. - What about the fetus? What about the fetus? - What about the baby? Is she gonna lose the baby, doctor? - We're taking her into the OR. - What? I've gotta come with you. - Hey, hey, you can't come in! - What do you mean, that's my wife! I've gotta go in! Let me go! Don't you touch me, man, I'll kill you! - John! - Don't you touch me! - John! - I need to be with her! - John, wait here! - Let me be with her, that's my wife. I can't leave her alone! - John! - [Doctor] Let us do our jobs, that's the best way you can help Carmella. Wait here. (breathes deeply) - Thank you, thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. - It's alright. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (heavy breathing) - (sighs) John. John. - Right here, honey. Right here. - The baby? - Sorry. - Oh my God. - Sorry. - Mr. Stoneman, Mr. Stoneman. You beat those thugs pretty badly. The kind training you have must be very effective. Why don't you tell us about it. - Get out of here! - [Reporter] Just a couple of questions, Mr. Stoneman. The police say that - I asked you nicely despite your special skills, to get out of here right now. - [Reporter] They won't press charges. How do you feel about this? - Charge against what? They attacked my wife. - But because of your skills, other people are other people lying in a hospital bed. - They killed my baby. - Don't touch me, we can talk here. - Get out of here right now. - [Jason] Please get out of the room. Get out of the room. - Thank you, Jason. - I lost the baby. Oh my God. - I'm sorry. - Oh my God. - Please forgive me, honey. - It's not your fault. - Please. (sobbing) - Oh my God. Oh my God! (static crackling) - [Gary] Sir, I just saw the perfect competitor on a newscast. He's six feet, 195 pounds. He's trained and he has combat experience. - [Armstrong] Who is it? - His name is John Stoneman. He's a professor at a college in New York. 1Oth degree black belt in three martial art disciplines. - That certainly indicates potential. What's he done that's newsworthy? - Well that's the best part. A gang attacked his wife. He saved her. He killed one of the attackers and put two on the critical list. The press is hailing him as the all-american hero. - How nice. Just what we need. A hero. (dramatic music) - [John] Thanks for the lift home. - Don't mention it. This way. - It was very thoughtful of you checking in on us like that. Glad you arrived when you did. - Well everyone was really worried when they found out what happened. I just wanted to come by and see if there was anything I could do. - Ethics and Applications. It's one thing to deal with it in class, Jason. It's another thing to be truly provoked. No. I allowed myself to be provoked. I wanted to kill those people. All my training, philosophy. That just disappeared. Everything I believed in was torn apart by my anger. I failed, and my baby died because I failed. Maybe there's something else I could've done. Maybe something I said. - Anybody move, you're dead! (grunting) - [Tayback] Let him go! (grunting) Get your asses up. You, take Stoneman. Let's bring the kid along, too. (grunting) (static crackling) - Let's get this over with. We're going to air in five, four, three, two, one. (grunting) Camera three, get that long shot. Get off camera, camera two. Okay three, stay on, get off, camera two. Camera one, stay on Darcona. (grunting) Alright camera two, stay on Darcona. Number one, stay on Darcona. Move back, move back. Give me camera three. - [Hank] I've got it. - [Dave] Okay, stay in tight. Number two, stay in tight. (grunting) (fast, aggressive music) (grunting) - Get out of my way. (static crackling) (helicopter whirring) - The chopper has arrived and Stoneman is in the compound. I repeat, Stoneman is in the compound. - [Armstrong] Good. Bring him right in. - [Man In Glasses] Roger that, sir. - Double time, gentlemen, do not keep Mr. Armstrong waiting. He knows your names, your skills, your fears. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Where the hell are we? (gun clicking) - My name is Houston Armstrong. I'm an independent broadcaster. I run this facility. You've been chosen to appear on my next broadcast, a program called No Exit which undoubtedly you've never heard of. - This is crazy! - It's not crazy. - Gentlemen, No Exit is the only broadcast of its kind. Maximum entertainment value for maximum dollars. Right now we're starting a tournament, and some of you may play in it. For those of you who don't, we'll try to make your stay as comfortable as possible. - What exactly is No Exit? - Professor Stoneman, how's that lovely wife of yours? Tragic, truly tragic. No Exit is a little game of my own devising. The rules are simple, the action fast. You fight an opponent until one of you dies. Easy as pie. Mr. Tayback will see that you're comfortable. Good luck, gentlemen. Some of you may survive. - [Tayback] Move 'em out! - This doesn't happen! It just doesn't happen! - I agree, that doesn't mean it isn't happening. Let's just deal with it. - [Jason] Right Professor. (static crackling) - [Jason] You literally mean like fight to the death? - [John] I don't think he was joking. Excuse me, can you tell me where we are? - Fight to the death on television? - It's probably a very narrow broadcast signal, heavily coded. The technology's there. The equipment's not that expensive. - Well great, why don't we start up our own channel? - Jason, it's important to stay calm and stay cool. We're in a very dangerous situation here. - Yeah, you-- - Eat up, ladies. You're gonna need it. It's cold out there. - You have to tell me that? - We'll get a handle on things. I've no intention of letting you or kill or die for someone's entertainment. Now just stay cool and calm, okay? - Yes sir. This is crazy! We're in the middle of nowhere, a frozen nowhere! - [John] There's gotta be a way out of here. We have to look, think, and not overreact. (tense music) - The beggars are here. - We've got company. - I could kill you right now, ladies. - Who the hell are you? - Shut up. Hey, look at me, you faggot. - Back off, Darcona! - [Darcona] Fuck you, Doc! (grunting) (alarm blaring) - [Armstrong] Armstrong. - The men are fighting in the cafeteria. - [Armstrong] Who is it? - Darcona, Doc, Jason, Stoneman. - Stoneman, goddamit. Tayback, get down there, stop them. - Roger that, sir. (grunting) (screaming) - [Doc] Oh shit. - Welcome to No Exit. (grunting) - You just don't learn, do you John? - How ya feeling? - [John] Anybody get the number of the truck that hit me? - [Doc] (laughs) Congratulations on surviving Mr. Tayback's preliminary introduction course. Name's Aaron Smithers. All the boys call me Doc. - John Stoneman, that's Jason. - Aaron Smithers. Hey, you were a wide receiver for Chicago. I remember when you disappeared about eight months ago. - You've been here for eight months? - [Doc] Oh yeah, I've been here for eight long fucking months. - You tried to escape. - [Doc] Believe me, there's no way out of here. I've been looking. - [John] I'll find out for myself. - [Doc] Then you just go for it. - [Jason] He will. - [Doc] You got a nasty one there, huh? - Yeah, it was a good hit. The only thing I can figure is we must be in some part of northern Canada, maybe inside the Arctic Circle. - [Doc] Could be. - Well, they have communication here. I mean, they're bringing in supplies every day, right? Prisoners. Somebody's gotta know we're here. - Speaking of prisoners, what about the guy with the bad haircut? - That's Darcona, the guy who attacked you. He's fought in three of Armstrong's tournaments and he's been here nearly a year. See, that's what you get when you win. A chance to fight again and again. - So what's his story? - He killed three cops and escaped from jail. I dunno, somehow Armstrong was able to get ahold of this guy. - We're seriously screwed! I'm out of here! - Jason. - You don't think everybody who comes up here tries to escape? Of course they do. But after a couple of hours out there they come back. If they can find their way. There ain't nothing but rock and ice and snow out there. And Armstrong's men, they ain't coming after you. They don't give a shit. All it means is they're gonna have to find another competitor. And that's no sweat off their back. - So what do you do? - Stay alive. Fight if I have to. - Why not band together. We could overpower them. - They outnumber us two to one. And we can't get organized with guys like Darcona among us. And they've got guns. - So you fight for this maniac? That's bullshit! Total bullshit! - You listen to me! You just got here! You got no right to open your mouth up in front of me. Now when you've been here for a month and killed a couple of guys and put your life on the line three, four, five times, then we will talk. (static crackling) - [Detective] I'm sorry Mrs. Stoneman, but we can't find a trace of his whereabouts. - Wait wait wait, what do you mean there's no trace? It's not like my husband to just disappear like that - [Detective] Well, I find it pretty hard to accept too, Mrs. Stoneman, but there's nothing more I can do at this point. Your husband just seems to have vanished. - Look detective, John was very upset. I'm really worried about him. He's my husband. I love him. I need to know what's happened to him. - [Detective] I understand, I understand, and we're doing everything possible to locate your husband, but without any-- (tense, dramatic music) - Oh, you're fast! Gonna use it? Come on Johnny, use it. You're faster than a bullet? Huh? Come on. Whoa! Just give that fucking thing back to me. Okay now, just give it back. Give it back. Yeah. Tough guy. But notice you're getting real chummy with the nigger and the faggot kid. Now I think it's really good you're making friends here at camp. Be awful if something happened to them. Now stand the fuck up. Armstrong wants to see you. Professor. Professor of bullshit. Oh. - John. Please. My altar. Sit. Share some tea with me and meditate. I like to think you'll do very well on our little show, Professor. I feel you bring a breath of fresh air to the proceedings. - [John] I could kill you right now before Tayback could even fire his gun. - But you won't. I'd be dead, and Mr. Tayback would kill you. So what would it get you? - [John] Revenge. - For what? I haven't done anything. Oh, maybe a little kidnapping, but nothing that warrants my being killed. At least not by you, not yet. Besides, I have the feeling that revenge is beneath you. You're more noble than that. John, let me tell you about No Exit. Oh, you think it's barbarism, an anomaly, a few wealthy sickos who want to watch men beat each other to death, a truly fringe audience. But you'd be wrong to dismiss it so easily. - What do you think No Exit is if not sick? - An essential service. How many cultures have their bloodsports? All of them, I'd say, in one form or another. Football, hockey, boxing, well they're just more genteel version of what I offer. And guess what? They're not doing their job. Look at America. A sea of violence and bloodshed. Oh, we blame it on decline in morality and television, the movies. You know what? We're right. For all the wrong reasons. We need to offer a real outlet for those dark impulses. Oh, television tries. It pretends to understand, but like that pretty girl that only wants to hold hands. It's nice. But face facts, we just wanna fuck. Death, real death is one of the only things that has real impact on our tired, oversophisticated nervous systems. We need to feel that age old rush of adrenaline as we fight for our lives, knowing that one mistake could end it all in the blink of an eye. And if we can't actually participate in the killing, then the next best thing is watching it. You're so wrong. You've confused perversity with potential. - My impressive sales figures tell a different story. No, you're the one who's wrong, John. And the sooner you admit that, the happier you'll be. (breathes deeply) Breathe with me, John. (static crackling) - [Announcer] Welcome to the key event. Tonight we've got Aaron Doc Smithers, former linebacker for Chicago versus Chi Fong, one of the fastest, hardest hitting fighters from Hong Kong. (upbeat, dramatic music) (yelling) (grunting) (electronic beeping) (grunting) - I'm sorry. (Chi screaming) (explosion roaring) (heavy breathing) (grunting) - To me. Breathe Doc, you're not breathing. Stop, you're not breathing. If you don't breathe, you become tense, and if you tense up, your reflexes are slow. So you have to breathe. Bend your knees, relax your shoulders. I want you to get in touch with your inner spirit, your inner strength. Feel that power down there. I want you to feel that. Feel that, concentrate. Feel that power, you feel it? Take all that power and that strength through your body into mine. Feel that power and that strength. One punch. Bring your arms up. Concentrate, focus. Power, inner strength. Again. Again. Again, breathe. Again. (grunts) Right inside block. I open the body like a book. I see all your pages. From here, you're vulnerable. There, here. (grunting) Take this. You understand? - I understand, John. - [Armstrong] What is it, Gary? - [Gary] Jefferson killed himself. We found him hanging in a storeroom. - He was supposed to fight tonight. - That was the plan. - How disappointing. Perhaps it's time we throw our Professor Stoneman into the mix. (heavy breathing) (grunting) - [Dave] Relay's down. (static crackling) (upbeat, intense music) Hey, where's camera seven. Running system diagnostic. Mainframe search, we're peaking. We're going to air in five, four, three, two, one. - Armstrong, I told you, I'm not gonna be any part of this. - [Armstrong] Fight, or both of you will be shot dead immediately. I assure you the weaponry you see around you is quite real. Now fight dammit, and make it good! - Forgive me! - No need for forgiveness. - [Announcer] Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Tonight is the cage event. The fence is electrified, as are the staffs, both deadly, and it's John Stoneman's first event, his first match, his first test. He's a skilled athlete, we all know that, very accomplished and proficient in martial arts. The big question is, and it's a big one, can he make the kill. Stoneman's opponent tonight is Ronald Henry, the world champion heavyweight kickboxer and and a formidable opponent he is indeed. (grunting) (upbeat, intense music) (electricity crackling) (grunting) (Ronald screaming) - [Armstrong] Kill him, now. - Go ahead, you wanna shoot me? Shoot me. I'm not killing him. (Ronald screaming) (static crackling) - For a smart guy, you're pretty damn stupid. You keep this up, you're gonna get yourself killed. - Keep what up? - You know what I'm talking about. You've got to kill your opponents. If you don't kill your man, Armstrong's gonna kill you. Have we got that clear? Can that overeducated brain of yours break that down? - I won't kill. - Hey listen to me. It's not an option, John. - [John] What if we all refuse to fight, refuse to kill? - Then he'll kill us all, one by one. - [John] Then he'd be out of business. - Oh no, Armstrong would just keep bringing more and more competitors like he always has. - And what if they refuse to fight, refuse to kill. Then he'd be out of business, wouldn't he? - What if there was a war and nobody came? Ah come on, John! You're forgetting about guys like Darcona, men who get off on violence and murder. - But you and me, we can make a difference here, we can set an example. If we refuse to play Armstrong's game, we send a message to people like Armstrong, people that abuse fellow beings. Like hatemongers, Nazis, racists. People like Armstrong must be stopped, Aaron. No matter what cost. - I don't know if I'm ready to pay the price. - What if we can't escape? What if this is the only way out? Huh? I'm not gonna play by Armstrong's rules. I killed once before. And maybe I was justified, maybe I wasn't. But I will never, never kill anyone under circumstances like these. (static crackling) - Reports from our field operatives suggest that Stoneman could be a problem with subscribers. - How so? - [Gary] Well, we had complaints in Cairo, Delhi, and in New York. - Complaints? Really? Our subscribers are complaining? - They're upset Stoneman didn't kill his man. - Is the man alive? - No, he died about an hour ago. - Why did he die? - [Gary] Because of injuries sustained in last night's fight. - Seems Mr. Stoneman did his job then. - Sir. You missed a spot. - [Armstrong] You will play by my rules, John. - You are violating every imaginable concept of human decency. You kidnap people and you turn them into animals. And you do this all for the lowest of reasons, money. I don't know, it's like something in that sick mind of yours seems to rationalize that, justify it. You practice sophistry and you assume airs of wisdom and superiority. But you're nothing but a very greedy and very exploitive man. And I'm gonna stop you. - Go ahead John, make a move. See how long it takes the guard outside my office to make you a memory. Very eloquent, though. I'm touched. You know, there were times during your fight last night when I thought we'd lost you. But you pulled it out in the end. Perfect, just perfect. Oh, almost perfect. You see, the man you fought did not die during the telecast. Oh, he was in a great deal of pain, but he didn't die until the show was over. I don't think you ever intended killing him. I think his death was just a happy accident. It starts to get around that our competitors only sometimes die, it's not good for business. - Business? Men like you call slavery business. - John, this is my world. I own it, and I own you. You'll kill when I say kill, fight when I say fight. - I won't fight. I won't kill. - But you already have, John. What about those poor young men you killed while protecting your wife? - That was self-defense and that was more than justified. Don't you throw that in my face! - You see John, everybody justifies, rationalizes. Even you. Anyway. I'm not too concerned. When a man is faced with a decision either to kill or be killed, I put my money on self-preservation every time. - I won't kill. - Don't be too hasty, John. Remember, all our decisions impact on others. Friends. Family. - You leave my family out of this. You hear me! (static crackling) - Let me guess, filet mignon? Barbecue shrimp? Calamari? (tense music) - See you around, sweet meat. (metal clattering) (heavy breathing) (grunting) - Come on! - Even in the midst of winter, there is an invincible summer. Your breathing was much better today, Aaron. - Maybe there is hope. - Hope, hope for what? Hope that you kill a couple more guys before they kill you? Huh? Hope to stop the suffering, Doc? - Cool your jets, Mr. Samuels. - We gotta escape! Or we gotta kill them! There's no more options here! - Jason, our opportunity will come. - I'm not dying in here! Or on television. I'm ready to escape now! Are you coming? Or you staying? - Jason, listen to yourself, come here. Jason. - Kid could be right. - We will escape. Not yet. We're not ready. We don't know enough about where we are, how far we are from civilization. We try to escape now, we'll all die out there.

(grunting) - [Jason] Let me out of here! Dammit, dammit! Open this door! (grunting) - I'm gonna hurt you. I'm gonna make you scream. (grunting) Don't move, baby. (Jason screaming) - Jason, have a nice date? (Jason groans) - Jason? Jason? Jason? What happened to him? What happened to him? - Darcona raped him. Used him like a woman. Personally, I think Jason liked it. Have a nice night, John. (tense music) - Jason, are you alright? - [Jason] Don't touch me! This is your fault. You understand? This is all your fault. - I'm sorry. - [Jason] You're sorry? Get out. Leave me alone. - Jason. - [Jason] Get out! - [Armstrong] (clicks tongue) Not a pretty sight. - [John] You son of a bitch! - (clears throat) That was a warning John. You wouldn't obey me. That's what happens when you don't obey me. People get hurt, innocent people. The name of the game is kill or be killed. - He's a kid for god sakes! - John, I'm a reasonable man. That's why Jason's still breathing. Next time I might not be so reasonable. Come on, John. Get into the spirit of things. Kill somebody. (Tayback imitates gun firing) (tense music) - [Jason] The fuck! - You make a sound, I'll kill you. - You'll kill me, huh! Huh? Huh? (upbeat music) (heavy breathing) - How'd the little faggot get out of here, eh? - Okay, John, bring the kid back! Don't let Jason die out there! Bring him back, John. - Sir, Stoneman's in the transport compound and he's got an ATV. Shall I have him stopped? - No. Let the Professor go. - Roger that, sir. (engine roaring) (heavy breathing) - Don't be a fool. You'll die out here. I'm not gonna let you kill yourself. - I'd rather die free than live in there! - I'm taking you back! I'm going back! You won't make it. - It's the only chance I got. - No it's not. Come back Jason. We're all gonna get out. - How? - I don't know how. But I promise you, we're gonna get out. We're gonna get out. Okay? We're gonna get out. I promise you. (tense music) - Drop your weapon and step away from the machine! Samuels, drop the gun! - [Jason] Get out of the truck, Armstrong, now! - Jason, drop the weapon. - Armstrong, get out of the truck. Get out now! - Five seconds, did you hear him? - I wanna go home! - Put the fucking gun down. - Five, four, three. - Jason, what are you doing, drop the weapon. - Two! - Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen. Jason, put down the gun. - Put the weapon down, Jason. You don't wanna kill anybody, okay? - Listen to John, Jason. We can work this out. - We're gonna get out of here. I promised you we're gonna get out of this. - Good. Thank you, John. - Okay. - Kill him. - No! (gun firing) (loud thudding) (static crackling) - Hey! Hey! Armstrong holds a much higher opinion of you than I do, Professor. Me, I figure you're just about good enough to piss on. Somebody clean him up. Get him out of there. - [Man] Mrs. Stoneman. - Hm? - [Man] Mrs. Stoneman. I have some news about your husband. Get up and get dressed, and I'll take you to him. - Mr. Armstrong sends his apologies. He's been detained, but he'll be with you shortly, John. The show's just about to start. I'm afraid I don't have any chips or popcorn to offer you, but I'm sure you'll enjoy the program just the same. (midtempo rock music) John, I want to talk to you about something. I'm thinking of starting up my own broadcast. I've got a great deal for you. You wouldn't have to kill anyone, just fight. We would do all the killing for you. Interested? - You get me out of here, you understand? I need to see my wife, and then I'll think about it. - Darcona, our reigning champion meeting in the semi-finals with Doc, Aaron Smithers, former linebacker for Chicago. Aaron. Aaron! Jesus no! No! - Stoneman's heading to the pit. Do you want us to stop him? - No. Let them get a good taste for each other. It'll make good promo. - [Dave] Okay, switch over to five. Push five. (upbeat rock music) - I will say goodbye to that faggot Stoneman for you. - Camera three, tighter on Darcona. (grunting) - What do you want on your tombstone, asshole? - [Dave] Get ready for a long. Camera three, stay on him, stay on him. (engine roaring) Okay, keep on him. Okay, switch over to five. Push five. - [Hank] Right. (Doc screaming) - Stay on top of him. Be ready, be ready. Camera three now. (bones crunching) Sweet dreams, baby. (grunting) - Get off, get off, get off, get off! - You're next, Stoneman! You're next! You're dead meat! Dead meat! ♪ Look at this state I'm in ♪ ♪ Even now my share is thin ♪ ♪ Don't spare it ♪ ♪ Spin at the road ♪ ♪ Spin at the sound of it ♪ ♪ Spin as you fall back to Earth ♪ ♪ Spin as you fall back to Earth ♪ - [Announcer] Tomorrow night, the final match of the tournament. Stoneman versus Darcona, don't miss it. Who will be the champion of this tournament? John Stoneman the thinker or Darcona the stinker? (static crackling) (helicopter whirring) (heavy breathing) - Very beautiful, Professor. John, we need to have a little talk. - There's nothing to talk about. - Oh no, we have a great deal to talk about. John, let me explain something to you. You're not going to win. You can't, it's just not part of the plan. - I'll win. I may even kill Darcona, but I will win, and there's nothing you can do to stop me. - Yes there is. Say hello John. You see, there's a great deal I can do about it. No Exit is my game. I created it, I run it, I say who wins and who doesn't. - But I thought I was good for the game. - Well you are, better than I'd hoped. The problem is you're a short-term benefit. Now Darcona, he's in it for the long haul. He's the man they love to hate. They'll tune in just to watch him lose. Which he never does. Because if he can't handle it, I can occasionally kind of lend a hand. Cheating's all part of the show, John. - You're insane. - Oh don't you see, John. You were a good and intelligent man. A few more fights and you'd be just like Jason or Doc. Just another victim. I need continuity, John, a continuing character. Nothing personal. Just business. But you are going to take a dive, John. Sacrifice your life for the life of the woman you love. What could be more noble than that? And after all, isn't nobility what you're all about? - What guarantees do I have that you'll let her go? - Just my guarantee that if you don't do what I say, I will kill her, and I will make you watch, and then I will kill you. - [Carmel] John! - I'm really sorry it has to end this way, John. But the bottom line is the bottom line. And the good businessman always goes for the long-term investment. - Armstrong! If you harm so much as a hair on Carmel's body, I'll tear you limb from limb, and that's a promise! That's a promise! You hear me! (Armstrong laughing) I'll kill you! (knuckles cracking) - Yeah! (static crackling) - [Announcer] Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion of our tournament. Tonight's event is the final event and it's Darcona versus Stoneman. The event we've chosen is the key. We're all familiar with it. - Alright, let's get this over with. Going to air in five, four, three, two, one. - [Announcer] Both competitors are wearing wrist cuffs fastened above their wrists. The only way they can be removed is by the keycard at the end of the corridors. - Jesus, I hope he doesn't lose. - Me too. - I think you'll find this very interesting, Mrs. Stoneman. There's an intensity in our broadcast unlike anything you've ever seen before. We're very proud of our work here. - [Announcer] Stoneman to the starting line. Here comes Darcona. - [Announcer] Darcona has five minutes on his wristband Stoneman has two, so the pressure's really on for Stoneman to make it to the end and liberate the keycard which will guarantee his freedom. - [Announcer] They're off! (tense music) - Stop this now. - Won't be much longer, Mrs. Stone. (grunting) - Camera three's down! - Dammit! (grunting) - Stop this, stop this now! - It won't be long now, Mrs. Stone. (grunting) - Move in, camera one, tighter. (grunting) - This is insane. - No it's not, it's television. - No! (grunting) - [Darcona] No exit, baby. - No! - Don't worry, Mrs. Stoneman. Your husband won't feel a thing. - Camera seven, close up on Stoneman pulling out the knife! Yeah! (grunting) (groaning) (glass shattering) - You lose, baby. (explosion roaring) - Wow. - Transmission terminated. - Congratulations John, you won. Somehow, you killed Darcona and managed to beat me at my own game! - Hey Dave. - We had a deal, and you fucked me over! You hear me? You fucked me over on my show! On my show! - It's over. - Bullshit, it's over. It's not over until I say it's over. - I really hate Armstrong. - Me too. - Let's go to air. - What would your subscribers do if they know you'd kill my wife and I in cold blood. - I don't fucking know. Hunt me down, kill me on my own show, tell their friends to subscribe. I have no idea. But they don't know, do they. - Well they do now. - Dave. Dave you cocksucker, you're fired, you hear me? And that goes for you too Hank! - [John] Armstrong, it's over. - Why? Because I kill your wife? Because I kill you? Hell, it's a bonus, John. I kill people all the time. Every broadcast I send three or four people to their deaths. Life is cheap, John. Your life, my life. Money is the only thing with value. - You don't know the meaning of value. - It's television, John. You can't stop me. A few good lawyers and I'll be right back in business. I'll just open up somewhere else. You can't stop me, John! - You're right, I can't stop you. (electronic beeping) - Fuck! (grunting) - [John] Come on! (explosion roaring) - Shit. This is Hank in control. There's a transport hovercraft running to leave in Bay 2. Anyone wanting to get out better be on it. - Let's get out of here. - Wait a minute, let's not be hasty here. Now John, I just wanna tell you one thing, okay. Armstrong is gone. It could just be you, and it could just be me. Hundreds of millions of dollars. - Do you mind? - What do you say, John?
