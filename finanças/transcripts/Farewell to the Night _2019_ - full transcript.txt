He must have been big. Or there were several. Maybe it's a pack. What are we doing, Youssef? They didn't shoot back until September. You can put on an energizer pull the cord to the stable. Don't look, it's an eclipse. It burns eyes. FAREWELL TO NIGHT 2015, FIRST SPRING DAY Check the drinkers. - You probably didn't eat. - Muriel, you don't have to. Scrambled eggs? There is also a salad. No thanks. He has been away for a long time. How do you live You don't actually see him. - We talk online every day. - Is that enough for you? Me your age a boy was needed on the spot. He is present, even when he is not there. What time will he come? He doesn't respond to my messages. About three. He doesn't want me to pick him up from the station. Have you seen the eclipse? He watched the entire nursing home. - They had glasses? - No, on TV. Could you pay me today? 200 for cleaning, I also put out 30 euros for cleaning products. I'll give you in a moment. It's for the weekend. I know it's not my business but what will he do in Canada? He'll find something odd like in Toulouse. Why so far? I want to travel. Will you go too I do not know. Heroes do not choose winners camp. They become heroes not through your goals but leading actions for transformation. They are born and grow up in battle, they go beyond human ethics. Thomas Carlyle sees a pattern in them. Salam. Nice trip Changed the code. I'll call you. - It's me, sir. - No visits. This is a friend. No brothel or hotel here! Goodbye. I found something in Antioch. You have to count between 5,600 - 6,000 euro, plus the unforeseen, so minimum 7,000 Bilal also said it was necessary there ten thousand for a year. - How many you have? - 2,360. - Only? - A lot missing? - A lot. - I'll change my clothes. How much? I have 4,500 and got a credit of 5,000. 5,500 are missing 6,000 would be perfect. You will earn there. But earnings depend on the contribution. - For sure? - I think so. But I don't know how is the weapon. With a gun? With kalashnikovs, shotguns, grenade launchers. In the price, do you have to pay? I hope for the price! Without exaggeration! We will ask on Sunday. - Are you in? - Moment. Wonderful water! Are you crazy? - Come. - No. I'm going to get you. No, it's too cold. - You do not know what you're missing. - How do you stand up there? What will you do if I die? I will be proud. Will you marry again? I do not know. But I won't stay in a women's home I would get crazy. How many children do you want? A lot. And you? I do not know. I do not know... Come! Ruby! All right? Still out of range? Do something. They're preparing for the antenna for five years and nothing! You can get mad. - Did you arrange the internet? - Yes, the modem is standing. I have not noticed. Fine. Why are you looking like this? I barely see you, I have to enjoy. - Do you need anything else? - No. I didn't sleep at night, I'm exhausted. I understood. I'm leaving you. Okay, gallop! Perfect yet! What's up? Good is the new one. Did you see her? Got talent. Has he been working here long? Since last week. I took her to the test for two months. Great. Guess who arrived. - Who? - Alex. - Is doing well? - Yes. I will rest here. In the name of Allah. - You saw me? - Yes. And? I wondered. Over what? - I did not know... - That? - That you are religious. - You already know that. For a long time? Eight months. Lila opened my eyes. How is that I did not think about what after death. What mattered now was and Lila showed me a second life. Second Life? Life counts afterwards. I lacked faith but your grandfather was pious. In Algeria he went to mass every morning. I don't know if there is anything after death I can't imagine that. Remember that I like Lila. I treat her like a daughter. I know you have a strong bond. But to put it on you such things to mind? She didn't put anything on me. We just think the same. And what connects us, it's only our business. I want to be with her. You already know. I guessed... - I have nothing to say? - No. Are you waiting long? I was busy. Three quarters of an hour. Does not matter, it's a great day for you. - Satisfied? - Yes. I ask for parishes and signature on the last page. Agreement with the option of extension. If we are still satisfied, you will stay for another six months. Relieved? It is a pity that so late. The trial period always lasts. And it rarely ends with a contract. I know. Thank you, madam. Excuse me. Yes, Mrs. Wilson, thank you that you called back. As for your record, I would need some documents. I will come later. Excuse me. Exit from administration, patient and PIT cards, retirement decision and card social security. Please attach insurance health, if you have... Yes... and birth and marriage certificate. Yes that's all. Perfect, I'll take care of everything. Thank you, Mrs. Wilson, goodbye. It's for you. Yes, sorry. I still have to move a sensitive issue. You refuse to take care of men. This is a problem for us. Why? We handle it in your group, all is well. Exposed arms are more hygienic. - Hi, Youssef. - Hey. Won't you kiss me What are you doing? We put the energizer in the orchard. Hello? Bilal? I said no coverage here. You'd have to see where I stand... What? No, Lila too I won't get any more... Bilal, I know, stop pressing... You probably have to take the car on credit, just like Julien... I'm done, my grandmother is coming. I'll call you tonight on Skype. Have you finally come to help us? Let him do what he wants. I did not know, that you are so pious. Where this from Impact of an orphanage? No, I didn't learn anything there. However, orphanage is an asset. You create the family you want, you're not telling anyone... Not everyone is so lucky. Do you go to the mosque - No. - why? - Let's change the subject! - No! I learn that my grandson and almost a charge they are fervent Muslims. I wonder strange? Why don't you go to the mosque? - You walk? - No! I prefer the internet. Internet? To study. To learn religion? To understand our bond with society. It's rotten. Rotten? Through materialism. There are no more ideals. I see it at work. The fate of the elderly it is proof of the fall of civilization. I learn a lot today... What? I wouldn't mind if Lila slept here with you. This is normal. Maybe for you. Well... - Good night. - Good night. Wait. Did you take your mom's photo? You said you didn't care about him. - That `s nothing. - He is here. - Where to put? - Give. - Good night. - See you tomorrow. Good evening. - Will you play poker? - Not today. - You need money. - But I won't risk losing. - It's for chips. - No thanks. - As recently. - No thanks. Good night. Lila, please. Sit down. We'll talk. I am old, lonely and I need company. That's why you live here. We agreed so. - I'm sitting alone! - I work. And you shut up after work with computer. You don't give me time for weeks! The deal was different. - He humiliates me that I have to ask. - I'm sorry. It'll be better if you look someone else. Keep driving. Yes, below. Yet. 385 per month. Open. Grade. You will sell left for 10 pieces. Is waiting I will check the conditions. "Delivery within 30 days at the latest after accepting the documents... It will never succeed! Calmly. But check when you propose something. It's amateurishness. SECOND DAY OF SPRING - Did you sleep well? - Yes. - Not too warm? - No. You'll sit next week to the piano. I miss him.

Six thousand are missing. We can sell a scooter, Lila will get a housing allowance, but you will run out... Don't shout, I understand! What should I do to attack someone ?! And don't poison me about my grandmother, I won't ask her for anything! We team. Is it well regulated?? Fine. Check everything! Eye slippers, reins. Take whips and gloves. OK, we're leaving. Trot! Show. One line, because you can see. It's a good idea? Do you have better? Why don't you ask She would give them to you. To Canada I will not ask. I'm an adult. You can't do that. You rob family, double sin. What are we not going? I won't give birth to this money. All in all Muriel is unfaithful, so you don't actually steal It's more booty. Let's say we have the right. I don't know, you're in it more proficient than me. What we do? Decide. It's unfaithful, so it's okay. You can steal from Kafirs. But he'll get it.

I have to stand on my head because he waved three brats? - Four. - Four! Will it never stop? - You don't want to meet them? - No. And don't show me the pictures anymore, this happiness in the tropics. He sent me a movie. Help... for help. Okay, I don't insist. What do you want for dinner? Will you open a jar of boletus? Thank you. I leave for a long time. Tell me the truth about my mother's death. You know the truth. She incorrectly counted the decompression, typical accident. - But specifically. - I told you. She probably panicked she surfaced too quickly and nitrogen was left in the tissues. She hated diving! She had seasickness she even vomited at forty meters deep! "Yes, but no one forced her." - Maybe? He was an instructor. End with it. your father is not responsible for this accident. You always reconcile everyone. Stupid not drinking you can't tap. I'm eating. You don't eat In autumn we gathered 200 kilos of mushrooms. I have saturation. I'll help you. - Do you want dessert? - Yes. Why are you never talking about yourself? I lead a banal life. What are you talking about here? I don't know about Algeria.

But will you come for jumping? You are Justin's idol. Lila will not be delighted. For now. Number 1 is ahead of us: Flore on Peanut. How tall is he? On Skype he was lower. You've chosen a nice place. Discreet. It's better not to show up. Get out. I have an answer for you. At the banks in Mosul there were 430 million dollars, the caliphate took them over. Eat, my wife got ready cheese and honey.

Live the way you want love whoever you want but I swear at Allah Lord of heaven and earth, that when we stand before Him, it will be too late. And I will say, "Lord, ask him why didn't he fight on your path. Why did he listen to the screams of Muslim women in prisons of infidels and did nothing... ', We had a flat in Rakka. After someone. It was evident that its predecessors they left in a hurry. Great luxury... Don't you regret coming back? The fact was good. We had fun. I had niqab, gloves, makeup, Chanel purse. And husband! Married? - Not yet, but soon. - You will stand in court. - How is that? - You'll get a marriage contract. - Get married before leaving? - Otherwise you would have to have a guardian. Did you have several husbands? There was no time. I didn't want to give birth there. - why? - I was scared of dirt. How many women have husbands? Three or four. Shock because it is a Muslim country. But guys die and a woman can't be alone. Muriel! Youssef didn't dare tell you. They called from the bank. Stud checks have been completed for six thousand. - What? - You didn't put them up? Youssef knows I consult with him every expense. You have been robbed - What is?! - Do you have that book? Yes, at home. I will check. Report it and you will get your money back. Checks are in the office. Youssef says it's your grandson. I know he doesn't like Alex but exaggerates. I'll call the bank. I will talk to him. - Drive you away? - No, I'll be back on foot, thanks. Good morning, voicemail here Alexa, please leave a message. INCORRECT PASSWORD. PLEASE TRY AGAIN. And what? You're right with the checks. Alex's job. It's hard to come to terms with it.

I don't have him here. Why are you interested in him? Please, it's this one. "I would like to work in your orchard but I have to inform about your special situation: I fought in Syria and then, discouraged, I came back to France. I served three years I have parole. I am not proud of what I did. I hope you will give me a chance, although I know it's not easy... - You refused him. - He's a terrorist. He could write honestly. Do you think I will employ a guy who worships IslamP Why are you bothering me? closed case? If you are young a believing Muslim, Jihad is your element. If you are stuck in sin and disobedience is the best way to redeem wines. You who drink wine which you indulge in fornication, who are passionate about football, who are wandering the streets stadiums and shopping centers save yourself a severe punishment. Live a real life in Allah among the prophets who preach the truth, martyrs and God-fearing people. This is the best company. I give you valuable advice. I swear at Allah I'm not cheating on you. At the end of his life The prophet used to say: "I would like to fight, die and fight again and die '. Wait a minute. How long does the training take?

My daughter. Go have fun. Flee. What do you expect As I said: talk to me with my grandson. Do you think this will help? That it would help him? I'm meeting mothers but as part of associations. Privately it's banned. And I can't see each other with radicalized people. I have to ask. No! I don't want trouble. - He hasn't done anything yet. - Prevent him from leaving. But how?! I'm sorry to say that but I know their methods. The grandson will not come back. Alex! What? Let's go You have ideas, I have already slept. We haven't talked much today. Jiffy. Are you leaving twenty-four? With Blagnac? No, from Barcelona. Why from Barcelona? They have better connections. They serve noon. Canada too, the whole world. Something is with the electrical box, have you seen? No why? In stable. I don't know, something is happening. No. Seriously. I'm afraid of short circuit. Let's take a look if you're worried. Aren't you There is no money. I don't hear anything strange. Listen to it. No, that's normal. What are you doing? What are you doing?! - I don't want you to leave. - What?! You're lying! You've always made it up since childhood. But that's different. - Did you rummage over my things? - And you robbed me. You did not know, that the bank will notify me? Why Istanbul ?! Do you want to cross the border ?! - Open it. - No. Open. Open! You have no right to judge me! FOURTH DAY OF SPRING CLOSED CENTER Good day. Why is nobody there? I gave everyone a day off. We need to rest. Alex doesn't receive my messages what's happening? He's not here. I threw him out. They called from the bank about checks. I just have to report it formally. I will find out who did it. - Can you tell me something? - No. - For sure? - Yes. Me to Bilal Lauzin, will you inform him? - Who to announce? - Lila, that's enough. No, he didn't say anything. I knew. He fired us. Was washed off. Simple - it's betrayal. - Don't piss me off, he'll be back. - I'm pissing you off ?! Calmly. You're right. Let's make a siesta. Are you crazy? Strange guy. We used to sleep together and you know what he did? He caressed my stomach and kissed his forehead. In the morning said that he suffers from sleep apnea. Yes, since the age of ten. Did you sleep with each other Are you sick ?! Do you know each other long? From a child. You ask too many questions. You are my siblings. What are you doing? The rest of my old life. - I'll quit there. - You will trigger an alarm! It's off. Omnibus you. It's me again, calling since morning! What's going on where are you? I do not understand. Call me back, we're worried about Bilal. I'm sorry for being late. Thank you for coming. Please stop now. The daughter is at her mother's. And without her I feel lost. I see few people, you know, it's a change for me. I just have to be home before nine. Do they check you every day? They're watching, normal. After Charlie Hebdo shouted takbirs. - What? - Allahu Akbar. Whole block. I had the impression that they are everywhere. The prison shook. Then I realized that they are crazy. You haven't seen it before? I fought, I didn't have distance. Man considers himself for the only righteous. It's hard to get out of it. Alex is a boyfriend introverted. May you convince him. - Why is he doing this? - There is no explanation. I've never been to a police station, I was not punished at school. I didn't like my life that's all. I had some friends we played on the console I read manga and listened to rap. France was bothering me. What matters is how we live. Is that why you went to kill there? The psychiatrist said I was weak. It is true. I was often sick I forced myself to sport. And there it was different I became handsome. People liked my posts on Facebook the girls pushed with marriage proposals. We murdered licking ice cream. We rushed vans 200 per hour - such fun. Mood like a camp. We didn't realize from his deeds. What flowers are these? Are almonds? Cherries. - You're not coming? - No. You'd better talk in two. My name is Foued. I was in Syria in 2012. I fought 50 days... Let it open. He won't do it. What do you want? To bother me in the exit, get morals? It's easy for you, I'm closed. I am asking for the key. Where?! Did you relax there? But you know, there are still brave people. Listen to what awaits you. I don't want to know, get lost. Hello? It's me. You must come for me. Hurry up. Drive to the power plant. I was afraid! - What happened? - Wait a second. I am. Alright, i found him... I do not know what happened, I'll explain later. I'll call you in a moment, it's not good with him. Alex, I'm waiting, what are you doing? I'm coming. Good morning, do you recognize me? We would like two for today. 90 euros. Next to your friend's room. Well. I would like a passport, please. One will be enough. Will you let him know? Your grandmother is crazy! Don't tell me about her. Take off this helmet. - And how will they send a description? - You don't have to be lurking here. Give it. What did the renegade say to you? We didn't have time to talk. I didn't say all my prayers. It's nothing you'll make up for. Tell me... - Did you do any foolishness? - What? Did you kill him - I don't know, I strongly urged him. - How? Shovel. He was lying when I ran away. That I missed! Sit down. I think we will change the plan. I brought chicken skewers. Nice of you. We verify plans. We change nothing, departure tomorrow. I don't go with him if they are looking for him. What does it mean? We split up. He is right. We meet in the morning at the airport. Everyone arrives on their own. What you gonna do We spend the night in Barcelona. I won't have a guardian. No husband. This is a problem. - Alex, sooner. - Already. We stay together. I don't want to to catch you through me. I said! You are hopeless but we don't split up. Thank you. - Are you not observing? - There's no need to. They've x-rayed me, I'm fine. Poor four seams. But your grandson started his war. He left me a farewell letter. Everyone leaves. We download patterns from the Internet. Where did you work before you go? I was a bodyguard in the night club. You are not a robber. Small dimensions they can do harm. There were fights every night. Monotony. I wanted to enlist to marines. I knew some Arabic they offered me connectivity. It was out of the question I wanted to be a commando. So it failed. I don't like talking about it. I must go. The bracelet is calling. - I'll take you back. - No way. I won't let you go with a skull injury! Skull injury, are you kidding me? I'm fine. Really. Well, I'll say goodbye Goodbye. Excuse me, but I can't stay like this. It will seem funny to you but... I'd be relieved if I took you back. I want to talk. Do you understand Well. - What to do? - Thread. You can't do anything else. And you What did you think you were going with? I think I wanted to change my life. - Does it hurt? - No. Maybe now me? You feel worse than me. Yes. Thank you. 10 minutes. Thank you brothers that you are with us. And on time. Abdel will be a matchmaker and Fabien and Said are witnesses. I will be Lili's guardian. Live in God's fear and die in full devotion to Allah. Keep your fear of the Lord who created man and woman and through them he populated the land. Shiver with fear of Allah that he would not break the blood. Allah sees you. Fear Him and let your speech it will be simple that he would let you do good and forgave sins. Obedient to Allah and his Prophet will experience prosperity. The date will be two dates. Do you accept these conditions? Alex, I give you Lila for your wife. I agree to this wedding. - I first? - Yes. Already. Bilal won't hear us? How is that He sleeps next to me. We will not yell. Come. - Don't you want to kiss me? - Want. You only smell of milk. Cheeky. And you have a mustache. - Do not panic. - I'm not nervous. It will be easier there. No rush. FIFTH DAY OF SPRING We pass into a trot. Hands, girls. Yes you are good I didn't bring anything from the market. I can't choose without you. Will you give me coffee? - What, are you cold? - Some. Alex has left. And not to Canada. We won't see him again. What are you talking about? What's happening? You are scared? - No. - Some. Cowardice has a history. Before Islam, the coward was the one who broke the laws of the family he escaped from the duty of solidarity. From the Prophet, he is the one who lack determination timid, lying in speech, quickly quitting. The coward lives in falsehood, proclaims fidelity to the Prophet, but retreats as soon as possible This one will turn around. We can't do that. Heroes do not choose winners camp. They become heroes not through your goals but leading actions for transformation. They are born and grow up in battle, they go beyond human ethics. Good morning, police. Please provide ID cards or travel documents. Good morning, sir, let us with you. Please stand up. Look at me Calmly. Look at me calmly. There are no dangerous items? No nerves, everything will be fine. Please go with a friend. Please stand up. Stand up, lady. We look at me. A friend will put on handcuffs, take it easy please Look at me! Please, I'll be fine. We are leaving. The Lord will let us. Lift him up. Hold your hand First ring. Don't struggle. Okay, get him out. To exit. Coffee? He was captured at the last congress before the border. It went without a problem there was no resistance. What's next? - We'll hear him in DGSl. - why? We'll check where he was going. He didn't cross the border! If the grandson was going to Syria, to ISIS, he broke the law. Standing in court. I do not understand. I just wanted to keep him. And rightly so! Thanks to you, we avoid the worst. Do you know these people? He was with them. She praises online terrorism and he is a recruiter. Both of them under observation for half a year. Fortunately, new recipes allow us to work faster. These are dangerous times... A MONTH LATER You haven't eaten again. You have to force yourself. I will leave dessert and cream cheese. What time should you pick her up? Coming out for the first time not too late for five o'clock. Still not talking? Are we going to ride Muriel? Shall we? How good to see you! Good day. You thanked me without any need and I really have what for! The bracelet is gone. Also thanks to you. Thanks to me? My judge read your testimony. You talked about me, it helped me. I'm free. What about the grandson? There is no trial date yet. Do you go bye? It does well. I don't want to hear about me. Known. Don't give in you have to write to him. There is no strength, can't you see? Do not say that! So I will. I will write to him right.
