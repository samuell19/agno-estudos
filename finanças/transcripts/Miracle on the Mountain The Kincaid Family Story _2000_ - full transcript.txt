WOMAN ON PA: Call on line one for Mr. Kincaid. Oh, he's busy. Don't worry, it's okay. He won't mind. You know you two would get along so much better if you spent more time together. Carla, I'm a history teacher. I make a teacher's salary. To your father I'm low income housing and you're the mansion on the hill. That's not gonna change. But you tell me all the time how frustrated you are at school. Yeah, but then I have one of those days when the kids and I are talking about the same thing and we're on the same wavelength. It's worth the frustration. Okay. I'll be right back. Stan. Stan, you're not listening to me. I don't care about his sales record! The guy started out with me. He's been here since the beginning and as far as I'm concerned he's gonna be here at the end. [KNOCKING] Dad? Hi sweetheart, come on in. -I, I can come back. -I'll just be a second, okay? Just hold on. Stan, listen. Why don't you work with him and then I'll speak with him. And I'm sure everything will work out fine. And, Stan, I really appreciate your effort in this. Goodbye! What do ya think? Huh? It's an anniversary gift from my office staff. It's beautiful. I thought you weren't coming in here today. I'm not. Charlie and I were out shopping and I thought I would come by and visit. Where is he? He's downstairs. Well why didn't you bring him up? I didn't think you had the time. I always have time for you guys. Go on down and get him and bring him up here. Hi! Hi. How was school? Boring. Did you get a grade back yet on that geometry test? C. Well at least you passed. Mom, I get better grades than any of my friends. Does that mean you're happy with a C? Well, no. Thank you. What's that? A list of supplies for the cabin. Anything you wanna add? Do I have to go? We've been through this, it's our anniversary. It's a family tradition. It's settled. I have homework. You should ask Dad for help with the geometry. It's his strong suit. Like he'd find the time. I went by your school today, spoke with coach Hanna. Yeah, about what? The team's prospects. Your progress. You mean making sure I'm not living up to your expectations. Well you have the talent to be a starter, I don't understand why you want to sit on the bench. You know, Dad, it's just possible I won't turn out to be the big star you were. And I can live with that. How was work? Oh we're in a bit of a slump right now. But I started a sales contest. If that doesn't work out I'll crack the whip. You got something to say, Sis. No, Dad, this is so interesting. Well it oughta be, because it's what puts food on this table. Well then we better start cracking the whip right now. Susan! I need to know if you plan on working at the job site over the holidays, the guys are holding a spot for you. I took another job. -You never said anything. -TOM: Where? Harris' market. And what are they gonna pay you? Six fifty an hour. I pay ya nine fifty! Fine. It's a retail kind of thing. It'll serve you well in the real world. They want me full time until school starts back up again. What about our anniversary trip? Well, I'd rather work. I'm sorry. You have commitments to this family... It's once a year! It wasn't last year. Well we started up a new project, I couldn't get away. So, this year I can't get away. Oh, fine! I got phone calls to make. You two do whatever you wanna do. Your mother, I, and Carla are going. We're all going. I wish you'd let the accountants do that, we pay them enough. Mhm. Hey I'm sorry I jumped up from the table. Sometimes I'm just like an eighth grader. I owe the kids an apology. Carla brought Charlie by the office today. You know the more time I spend with him the more I like him. She's lucky. Ha! He's a hell of a lot luckier. Would you like him better if he was falling all over himself to impress you with his executive potential? Well at least I would know he was ambitious. The world needs dedicated teachers. What about real estate salesmen? I married a real estate salesmen. And a damn good one too. Oh good, bad, didn't matter. I married him. What? Maybe we shouldn't force them to go. They're old enough to make their own decisions. No they're not! We spend little enough time as a family. We need this. We should have gone last year no matter what. We're not going to make that mistake again. -All we do is fight. -Then we'll fight. We'll fight as a family. Why do you suppose I can't talk to them anymore? Out of practice? They must know that I love them. Loving them is the easy part. Accepting them... that's hard. -Mom! -Hi sweetheart! -Hey, Mrs. Kincaid. -Hello, Charlie. -How are ya? -Excited! -Yeah. CHARLIE: Is that it? ANNE: First time on a small plane? -Uh-huh. -CARLA: Where's Dad? He's getting the weather. Did you see Susan inside? -Didn't she come with you? -No, she slept over at Ellen's last night. She was getting a ride. -Why don't you see if you can help Dad. -Okay. Here he comes. You should be all right, that system isn't due in until after midnight. The sooner we get out of here the better. Thanks, Dave. Hey! Everybody here? No honey, Susan's not here yet. Where is she? Okay, thank you very much. She didn't go by the house. Ellen's mother said she left for here over an hour ago. We're all loaded up. Where is she? We tried the house and Ellen's. She's supposed to be here now. I'm worried. Hello. Where are the contracts now? Do you have any idea where they may have gone? Well Ellen has a boyfriend, maybe they picked him up? Oh, they would have been here by now. They had snow at the landing strip this morning. It's clear now but if we don't get airborne soon we're going to lose our window. We could leave tomorrow? Bad weather could last for days. Look, I can't concentrate on the trip right now. I think we should call highway patrol. [PHONE RINGING] -Hello. -Dad, it's Susan - Where are you? I'm on the road, we got stuck. Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm okay but... -She's fine. You were supposed to be here at 2:30. Everyone is here waiting on you. Dad, I know but it's not my fault. How long are you gonna be? I don't know maybe, like an hour. She's gonna be another hour. Honey, what happened? Mom, I didn't do anything wrong. Nobody said you did. What happened? Look, I'll tell you when I get there. [SLAMS PHONE DOWN] -She's on her way. -We can't wait. What? I'll have somebody from the office come and pick her up and bring her to your mothers. You mean leave without her? Its' either that or we cancel the trip. Can I see you for a minute? First of all, you'd better calm down or you're not going. I'm calm, I'm just trying to make the best of a bad situation. We can't leave Susan here! If the weather clears I'll have her flown up in the morning. And what if it doesn't? Well then she gets to stay home which is what she wanted in the first place. Do you have a better idea? Right. ANNE: Buckle up, Charlie. It can get rough over the mountains. Don't worry, Dad's a great pilot. [THUNDER] What was that? Thunder. Honey, maybe Charlie would like some club soda. Yeah, thank you, okay. [SOUND OF PLANES OVERHEAD] Hello? Hello! Uh, Susan Kincaid? -Yeah. -Hi, yeah. I'm Marty from your dad's office and, uh, your mother told me to give you this. [SCOFFS] They left? Uh, yeah, I'm supposed to drive you to your grandparents' house. Hello? Where is everybody? You know, we should really get going, it's... -When can I take over? -Not now. Come on, just for a little while, you promised. I said, not now. Why'd you pay for the flying lessons in the first place? Charlie will you come up here, switch places with Rick? Oh come on, that's not fair. I'm trying to fly this plane, you're distracting me. Charlie! It's okay, go ahead. Go on, Charlie. -What is your problem? -He's my problem. Really nice, Rick. Enough. We'll talk about it later. Seattle center, this is Beachcraft, November, five eight. Niner O eight. Out copy over. Seattle center! This is Beachcraft November five eight niner O eight. I need to check positions, can you give me radar vectors, over. Charlie, hand me the charts there in my bag. Set it there by the light so I can see it. -Where are we? -We're right here. CHARLIE: What's that? ANNE: Hail. Maybe we should turn back? TOM: The storm is worse behind us, we can fly around it. My last report was that it was still clear up at the lake. -ANNE: Are you sure? -TOM: I think it's our best alternative. I also think you should sit down and put your belt on, Hun. Yes, Captain. ANNE: Dad says we can fly around this. There's no trouble landing at the lake. I dunno, Mom, it looks pretty bad. You havin' a good time, Charlie? Ms. Kincaid, we're doing our best to contact your father. We have Seattle Center working with us but, we've had no luck so far. That's because he doesn't want to talk to me. I already told you that. I think it's more like, storm-related. If you go on to your grandparent's, we'll contact you there. No. I'm not going anywhere until I talk with my father. Okay, this is his way of teaching me some stupid lesson. You can leave. I'm staying. Dad? We're icing up! -Tom? -The de-icers are not functioning. I'm going to have to take her down to break off this ice. Hang on. -But the mountains! -We can't go up, I'm too heavy. We can't maneuver where we are, we have to get rid of this ice. I'm sorry sir, I don't know what I'm talking about. Can I help you? Yeah, there's a dial down there on your left. Turn it to 7-7-0-0. 7-7-0-0 Okay. What did I just do? Emergency transponder code, it lets the controllers know we're in trouble, is the light on? -What light? -There's a light, is it blinking? I don't see a light! [THUNDER] Jeez! -Snow warning! -Oh my god. -Is the light blinking? -I don't see a light! Get down! [Overlapping dialog] -Turn the dial, all the way. -Got it! -Is the light blinking? -Blinking! Seattle Center, this is Beachcraft, November five eight niner zero... Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! [YELLING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Rick? Carla? Mom! Are you okay? -Yes, you? -I'm okay. Rick? My legs are caught. It's all right hang in there honey, I'll be right there. Mr. Kincaid! -Charlie? -Your husband's hurt. Go help him with your dad. Okay. What's wrong with Dad? I don't know let's just get you loose. Is it bad? He's breathing. Where's the first aid kit? Carla! First aid kit! It's okay. I'm all right. Where's that smoke coming from? I don't know! Mom, hurry! Fire extinguisher! Come on, we gotta get outta here! What are you drinking? Hot chocolate. Why? It looks good. You heard something. The plane never landed on the strip near your family's cabin. How do you know that? The sheriff's station up there, they sent a car out at my request. Okay, so then they landed somewhere else. No, we checked. I don't understand. They left at four. They had five hours maximum flying time, that's under ideal conditions. No! No way! No, they didn't crash, no way. No one said anything about a crash, your father is a very good pilot if they were forced down that doesn't necessarily mean the worst. Is there someone you'd like to talk to? Your grandparents? No! I called in search and rescue. As soon as the storm lets up, they'll start looking. These people are very good at what they do. There's no reason to give up hope. Why should I even believe you? I'll have airport security take you home. I'm staying until I know. One, two, three, go. Okay boys, easy. Easy! -Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm okay. Be still honey, you hit your head. Everybody okay? -Cuts and bruises. -Daddy? I'm more worried about you. -I smell smoke. -There was a fire but we put it out. We should head towards those trees in case it sparks up again. Do you see any lights or a road? No, nothin'. -Okay, Charlie, give me a hand. -No. -You've lost a lot of blood. -Charlie, come on, help me up. -I want up. -Tom... -Come on! -Okay. All right. -Daddy, are you cold? -I'm fine. Okay, listen up. They'll send out search and rescue teams to locate us, but they probably won't find us 'till the morning. So we're going to have to be out here tonight. How do we know they're going to come looking for us? They'll find us. They know where our location is. Rick, you and Charlie get anything out of the plane we could use to keep us warm and dry and anything we could signal the rescue team with. And if you smell any smoke or fire, get the hell out of there. I know what to do, Dad. Can the attitude, Son. This is serious. What do you want us to do? You, Carla, and I'll go down into those trees and set up a camp. Start a fire. Can you walk, Daddy? Course I can walk. I can't fly, but I can walk. Let's go. The media hasn't picked up on this yet, and I'd like to keep it that way. Can you put a lid on your people? You think the airport wants this kind of publicity? But I can't answer for the family I can. Hi. Who's he? Jack Calloway. Jack, this is Miss Kincaid, the daughter. You're search and rescue? That I am. What are all those maps for? Well, it's to help us define a search area. To make a plan. How many people in the air, how many on the ground. Like that. And when can you go out after them. Hopefully, first light. It depends on the weather. Do you know who my father is? I know his name. My father is one of the biggest homebuilders in this state. He's personal friends with the governor. Really? Was the governor on the plane with your family? No. Good, one less problem. Now, Miss Kincaid we'll do our very best to find your family, governor or not. Now get some rest, tomorrow's gonna be a long day. And what do you expect me to do, just sit and wait? What would you like to do? I don't know, help? Well if I think of something, I'll let you know. Yeah, thanks for nothing. Spoiled rotten. Nah, she's just worried about her folks. What about the rest of this stuff? Well, leave it I guess. We can pick it up when they find us. Hey that emergency transmission your dad had me send... -Yeah? -How does that work? Well, it's like an SOS. Sends out a radio signal to a special channel that's always monitored. They pick up the point of transmission, find us on radar. They pretty much know where we are. Some vacation, huh? Hey, hey. Your dad's tough. He'll pull through. Yeah, my dad shouldn't be doing anything, he's hurt. Oh but not him, he's gotta have everything his way. Doesn't trust anybody but himself. Kinda rough on the troops, huh? Well, welcome to the family. -Well looks like that's about it, huh? -Let's get outta here, then. Be right there. -What's wrong, Rick? -Nothin's wrong. Careful with the wet stuff, it'll just create smoke. Tom, please! Look, it's bleeding again. You have got to rest. We've got this under control. -Where's Rick? -He went to get more stuff from the plane. The plane, you mean the wreck? Do you realize how lucky we are? If we were lucky, we would have gotten there. You hungry? Not at the moment. We're not gonna have enough wood to get us through the night. -I'll go get some more wood. -Sit! Daddy didn't eat his soup? Is he okay? Pretty sure he has a concussion. What can we do? Keep him warm, wake him every couple of hours, and stop him from over-exerting himself. Rick? You okay? I'm just tired. Jazz anyone? [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Just what this party needs. A little entertainment. [JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES] [WOLF HOWLING] [WOLF HOWLING] Hi. You're awake! Yeah. Alive, and kickin'. And thinkin'. About what? About what kind of story this is gonna be to tell. I keep thinking about Susan. Well, we'll be seeing her soon. [CONTINUOUS CRACKLING] What was that? What was that noise? Avalanche! Wake him up! -Let's run! -Kids! -Let's go! -Get up! -C'mon! C'mon! C'mon Annie! C'mon, hurry! [YELLING] Keep running! Don't stop! [YELLING] Keep going, keep going! Run! [MOANING] Keep running! This way. Come here, come here. Help! Dad! [GASPING] [YELLING] Mom! Mom! -Carla! -Rick! [YELLING] [CRYING] [MOANS] -I'm sorry, honey. -It's all right. [GROANS] Oh good, honey! That will help. It's all there is. Everything else is buried deep. What about the plane? Couldn't even tell where it was. Is that all the firewood? Unless we start chopping down trees. With what? The shovel. Hack of as many live branches as you can. They won't burn very well but, they'll create a lot of smoke, and they can see the smoke from the air. Wouldn't we be better off, using those branches' to create a sign? S.O.S, or Help? It would stand out against the snow... You could write the Declaration of Independence. It wouldn't make a damn bit of difference. They'd have to be flying directly over it, in order to see it. The smoke they can see from a distance. -I thought they knew where we were. -Approximately. Why don't we just do both. We do not have the time, or the materials, to do both. We're gonna start with the smoke. It doesn't matter. What do you mean, it doesn't matter? There won't be any spotters. -Say again, Stony. -Okay, that's sector 23, all clear, Jack. Okay, got you! Remember your turnaround time. Yup, see you in about an hour. I'll keep you posted. Over. Over, and out. Alexis, that's grid number 23. What do the "x's" mean? Areas we've covered on the map. And that's it? Hell, it's rough country, Miss. Kincaid. You could lose a plane, the size of yours in a fold of land so small, it will never show up here. The mistake that we can't afford to make, is to be less than thorough. Look, I don't even understand why you're even looking here. Based on the flight plan. With correction for the storm, and wind velocity, and the last radar contact. We had to start somewhere. And you should know there's another weather front, scheduled to come through there, this afternoon. What does that mean? We don't put people in the air with zero visibility below. No point. So, you just stop? We follow safety guidelines. You think they're dead, don't you? Look, I can't afford to think that way. And neither should you. And you decided, it wasn't worth mentioning last night? There wasn't anything we could do! According to you! Maybe the dial got jarred in the crash. Maybe the signal was sent! Can't we just send the signal now? It doesn't work from the ground. But the light was on! What color? -Amber! -Amber! That's standby! I told you to turn the switch all the way! How am I supposed to know that there's more than two positions? Common sense, would tell you that! It was an accident, daddy. Yeah, we're stuck out here in the middle of nowhere, and you're making excuses for him! Charlie's sorry, okay? You're blaming me? Leave my daughter out of this. You know, if you let me stay up front, this wouldn't have happened. Oh, so now it's my fault! We shouldn't have been out in that storm, in the first place! We couldn't turn back... Quiet! Everybody. How we got here doesn't matter. What matters is how we get back! Right. They'll still send people to look for us, won't they? Why? Because we're missing, that's why. Yeah, they don't know that. Susan knows. He's right. We told her we'd call her if we could fly her up, in the morning. She doesn't get the call, she'll know we're in trouble. Mom wants you. Okay, I'll be right there. Is he okay? He's resting! Come here! -Show him the map. -Hey, look! There's a rangers cabin about 5 miles from here. Now, this time of year, there is definitely nobody home. But, nonetheless there should be some supplies, maybe a radio. Conventional wisdom says, we should stay with the plane. -What plane? -Exactly. That's it, right there. 4 to 5 miles! Ugh, do you realize how far that is in open country? What we have here is enough wood to last maybe a couple of hours. No shelter. Barely any food. Who knows when anyone will show up. The ranger cabin, is our best chance, to me. Okay. Do you think daddy will make it? He'll make it. Alright. Let's get the stuff we're gonna need. Put that wood on the snowboard. We'll drag it. [GROANING] Rick, Rick. Look. [MUMBLING] [MOANING] -Honey, honey. -Daddy! -Dad? -Honey? -Daddy! -Daddy, are you okay? -Daddy? -Answer me, Tom! -Dad? -Oh, god, is he going to be okay? [PHONE RINGING] Operations. Oh, hi, yup. He's right here, Jack? Deborah. Hi! Ah, nothing yet. I can't say, when. Well, how late? I know I promised to be there. I'll try. Alright, just tell the kids... Look, this is not going to work. I know. Me too. Okay. You have a good night. [YELLING] [CRYING] Is she okay? It's okay. Carla? It's okay, it's okay. Are you alright? Alright, baby, alright. [YELLING] Carla? Carla? -You lead now. -No, mom, no. -Yes. -No. Look, it's my turn. We have to take turns. Here, give me this thing. That's a girl. Keep your eyes down! It's okay. -Yeah. -Good, good. -You ready, boys? -Ready. -Ready. [PANTING] Look! Look, we found it! We made it! Mom! Ah, yes, yes! -We found it! -Honey, we're here! -Mom? -Rest, honey. -Okay. Let's get your father inside. If you can call it that. There's no place like home. We'll start in here at daylight. Now, the last point of radar contact was right here. So you can see the pilot is already well off his flight plan. The theory is he ran into some serious weather here. Tried to fly around the storm, going east and south, hoping to come around it, and make it back home. Something happened, he didn't make it. I know that country, Jack. It's all hills, there's no place to put down. Well, we all know what a good pilot can do. Now, the storm should run its course, by the morning. It's gonna get real cold. We need to get them home. 48 hour threshold applies. Grab some sleep. You're wrong. About what? They won't be anywhere near there. Then, where will they be? In your opinion? Up here. Okay, I'll bite. Why? Because, my father would never turn back. Miss. Kincaid, we'll search every inch of this map until we find your family. I know you're worried about them, and rightly so. But, we have the experience in this kind of search. Trust us. I just told you where they were! And we'll consider it. Now, let us do our jobs. We should save these. When this is over, I'm gonna soak in a hot bath for a month. 'Till Dad tells you he needs you at the office, and you go running. What's wrong with that? At least it's our business and not some supermarket, working for strangers. Yeah, you know what? I like it there. They know how to treat their employees. Grow up. You getting this, Charlie? You see, there's only two kinds of Kincaid's, the ones who work for my father, and the traitors. This is a man who nearly killed himself, to save your life last night. Don't talk to me about traitors. Oh, and you don't think I'd do the same thing for him? Cut it out, you two. -You know what? -This is hard enough. You always take his side. It doesn't even matter what it's about. -That's ridiculous! -Please. Charlie? He's got a point. [RADIO GOING] Grid Center, this is Air 3, over. We read you, Air 3. Sector 11 clear, repeat, all clear. Sorry, Jack. Over. Keep the faith. Over and out. [COUGHING] Where's everybody? They went to look for firewood. How you feeling? I got a little bump. You certainly do. How long have I been out? A couple hours. You dragged me up here? You hungry? There's a little soup, some cookies. You should have just left me. We could never leave you. Just as you could never leave us. Couldn't you find a place, with four walls? [WIND HOWLING] Thanks, honey. Try two at once. Oh, good. Ah! You try. I'll bet you, that chimney's blocked. It's the first thing we checked. Damn it! Everything's wet. A flare would work. Good, get it! No! We need them to signal for help! We need them now! [CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER] You okay? I'm not really mad at you. I know. You were supposed to do something with your family tonight. The job comes first. They understand that. How old are your kids? 10 and 7, two rambunctious boys. This is all my fault. How do you figure that? If I had been here, and if we had left on time... You were late, on purpose? No. Well? I'm up for some hot cider. How 'bout you? C'mon. So tell me now, how did you dad become a big shot home builder? Well, um. He started out as a salesman, and ah... put a few homes out on spec, and just kept going from there. That sounds like a lot of hard work. I guess. My mom's dad was a banker and um... When my parents met, my grandpa told my mom my Dad would never amount to anything. Those are fighting words! Yeah, with my dad, everything's a fight. I just wish I could talk to him. Look, right now your family's only thinking one thing about you. They're glad that you're not there. They're glad that you're safe. I'm a parent, I know how I'd feel. I take one look at you, and I know! You're sure that this search plan we have for tomorrow, is all wrong? Convince me. Alright, um. I was imagining I was in the plane, just like you had described, and um, we hit the storm, and we left late, and we had a choice. Either go on, or turn back. And I was thinking, what would my dad do? Okay. He'd be thinking, "Well, I've come this far". He gets like that. Stubborn. -Alright, so he believes in himself. -Well, totally. Look, he wouldn't turn back. So, he'd try and find a way around the storm. Exactly. Alright. I'll have my spotters fly through that area, first thing tomorrow. In fact, I'll talk that flight myself. Now, we have some cots. And one of them has your name on it. No arguments. You'll be a lot more help to me if you have some rest. I'll be more help to you if you take me with you, in the helicopter. [CHUCKLING] What are those, Charlie? Snares. You mean, for trapping animals? Yup. Do you think we could use them? They're rusted shut. We could make our own traps. What do you plan on baiting them with? Mud and stoned, with concrete. I'll bet this place didn't start out as a rangers cabin. It's too old. You can tell that, from the fireplace? And other things. Those traps. These nails, look. They're homemade done in some crude mold. Huh. Where do you get this stuff from? History teacher, remember? I bet... this place started out as a trappers' cabin! Fascinating. It is to me. Well I'm glad you're having such a good time. Kind of like a fieldtrip, eh? Yeah, it's been a hoot! Dad, stop okay? Charlie is just trying to take our mind off things. Well, that's the problem! We damned well better keep our minds focused on our situation here! We are in trouble people! I am just trying to keep us on track! No, you're not! You're trying to put Charlie down, and I am so sick of it! I am not trying to put Charlie down! Yes you are! What has Charlie ever done to you? -Except try to get along! -I didn't say he did anything wrong! -Yes you did. -This isn't helping! -No, it's great! -Let's get it out in the open, huh? -No! We are not choosing sides here! We're not pulling, farther apart! You need someone to blame? Blame me! I'm the one who wanted everybody to go in the first place! There! Satisfied? -Mom. -Crazy me. I had the idea, that if we could isolate ourselves from, the daily stuff. That we could make a start at putting our family back together. That doesn't matter now. It's survival. We, are not going to work things out! We're going to survive! We lived through the crash! We were meant to live! So... we stop arguing, conserve our strength, and concentrate on one thing. Getting home! Thank you. What am I looking for? The plane. Smoke. Fire. The sun reflecting off any medal, or mirrored surface. Any movement. Anything that you see that's out of the ordinary. Do you know if they have a flare gun on board? No, I don't know. -How can anyone survive down there? -You'd be surprised. Is it infected? I can't tell. I don't know. My first-aid training was a long time ago. Help me up. No. Not now. Come on, I feel fine. Everybody else is doing all the work. Let me up! -No. -Dad, just stay put, okay? I'll be back in a while. Be careful! Everything you said last night about the family... Were you serious? What do you think? I had hoped things would improve on their own. I let things slide, too. We're all responsible. Give a little. You don't have to win every battle. It's not too late. What are you looking for? Testing a theory. This must have been a trappers' camp. Cabin. Tanning shed. So what's missing? What is this, some kind of a test? -Pop quiz. -Hm. What's missing is storage. Some place to store food carcasses, anything edible. Safe from rodents or scavengers, while you're out maybe days at a time tending to your trap lines. So, you dig a cellar. It doesn't have to be big, just big enough. And you wall it off with rocks. Wouldn't that be back up at the cabin? I checked. It's not. But maybe it's down here. Yeah, but you're talking about what, 50, 100 years ago? -Yep. -And, besides, there's that refrigerator up at the cabin. And no electricity. They powered that by generator when somebody was here but they had to have some place to store supplies from year to year. If there were an old cellar, still dry and secure, that's what I'd use. Rick! Rick! [LAUGHING] It's as tough as shoe leather. It's jerky. Venison, I believe. It'll soften up. Charlie, this was inspired. I just wish there were more. I'm so hungry I could eat pine needles. Did you see any smoke coming out of the chimney when you were outside? Not much. You see, where we're situated here, the smoke blows down the valley. We need to go higher if we're going to signal a rescue team. You don't think they're looking for us by now? Susan knows we would have called. And Grandma and Grandpa. Yeah. It's clear right now, but it could change any minute. We should go up there right away with the flares and this, and wait up there. How long? If it stays clear, they'll fly all night. They know every minute counts. We hear a plane overhead, we light the flares, they see it, they can't miss that. At least here we have partial shelter, a fireplace, wood to burn. To keep that fire going, we'd burn ourselves out of shelter in a couple of days. But if we go up the mountain and a rescue plane doesn't fly over? It's too big a risk. I think we should keep this as our base. Yes or no? Yes. Say again! Over! -All clear, Pete. -Okay, thanks, HQ. Over and out. Okay. We're going back to refuel and, if the weather holds, we'll come back out again. -Sounds right. -Nothing from the other spotters? Nothing yet. What's that? Avalanche. And recent, too. You see it all the time up here. Let's go back. I saw something. Mom? There's no more. Hey, Mike, we just got a strong hit here. Thanks for this, Charlie. You're welcome. Listen, if I said anything to you in the last few days that bummed you out, forgive me. I'm sorry. I apologize. How's your project coming, Hun? Halfway. You happy with it? As long as we don't get snowed on. Tomorrow, if we're still here, we'll try to build a signal fire to go with it. I'll be feeling better by then. I'll be able to help. Nah, we can handle it, Dad. You have to take it easy, huh? Well, I appreciate you all, taking good care of me. I know I've been a pain in the butt. But I'll make it up to all of you. I promise. -I love you, Daddy. -Thanks, Hun. It's relatively intact, but really buried. We need earth moving equipment to get it out. Now, we may be able to dig a tunnel. The guys are still arguing about how we'd make it stable. Even if we go ahead, it's going to take time. A couple of days. Did the sensors pick up any sounds? Metal contracting, that's it. And no response to our signals. So, you're saying they're buried under there. The most likely scenario is the crash triggered the avalanche. They could be alive and not able to respond. We'll try the tunnel. Just wait here, I'll be right back. Hey! If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have got this far. -Daddy? -Tom? -Dad? -Daddy! Dad! Dad! -I don't see him. -Where could he be? -Charlie, check the flares. -Oh, God. Not here. He's gone up the mountain. He's gone up the mountain to signal for help. He told us so in so many words. But he knows he's hurt. He thinks everything that's happened is his responsibility. That's ridiculous. This is his way of making things right. And you know this? You can read his mind? There's nothing simple about your father. He works a 16-hour day, supervises 100 people, answers a thousand questions. But when it comes to reaching out to his own kids, he's lost. Don't worry. I won't take any unnecessary chances. Mom. You're not going by yourself. [SCREAMS] One, two, three. -You okay? -Okay, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's go. Guys. Guys! Guys, look! -They could be Dad's. -It's tracks! Sh! Do you guys hear that? -Look up there! -Helicopter! [YELLING] Please! Help! It's okay. It's okay. Come on, let's go. Come on. It's okay. [RESCUE TEAM CHATTERING] -Where is she? -She was just here. Ah, there she is. Susan! Susan! We're leaving! Susan, come back here! Susan, it's time to go. Just another minute! -What are you doing? -I'm looking for something. They've already searched through here with the snowmobiles. There was no sign of your family. If they got out, they would have come this way. We looked. We came up empty. Snow would have covered up their tracks by now. What if they left a message? What kind of message? Look, there's a high wind warning. We have to leave now. I'll send somebody through here again in the morning. Susan! That's Rick's! There! There! Rick was here! -Your brother made this? -Yes! -You're sure? -Yes, I'm sure! My brother has this really great pocketknife my dad gave him when he was 12 and ever since then he's been carving his name on something wherever we go. Well, at least we know he made it out. They all made it out! -We hope. -No! My brother wouldn't have done this if they didn't all make it out. They're alive and they're here! All right. Hold it on that helicopter! Dad? Dad! Son! I didn't think I'd ever see you again! I was so tired I sat down to rest and I couldn't get back up. I guess I'm not as tough as I think I am, huh? Help me out of here. Mom! Over here! Come on. Oh, God! Hey, Mom. -He's too cold. -I'm not cold, I'm stupid, huh? Loveable idiot. Where's the flare? I think it's in my pocket. -Everybody okay? -We're fine. How did you find me? We followed your big, fat tracks. I'm never going anywhere again without at least a pound of this stuff. Trail mix any day. Chocolate bars. Pure energy. That reminds me. It's time to review the menu for tomorrow's fabulous wedding anniversary feast. Congratulations, by the way. -How many years, Dad? -Many. I'll ignore that. Okay. We start with a 12-pound ham. Honey orange glaze. -Mmmm! -What else? No, no! Have mercy! Oh, no. This is good. Have you ever heard of thermic burn? If you think about food, pretend to smell it, taste it even you can fool your body into reacting like you've actually eaten something. It raises your metabolic rate, warms you up. See why we need a teacher in the family? -For times like this. -What times like this? [LAUGHS] Well, the world needs great teachers, and Charlie's going to be a great teacher. See? You were right. Your Dad and I just had to spend a little quality time together. Hey. How about mashed potatoes and country gravy? Green bean casserole with slivered almonds and bacon bits. -Lemon cream pie. -Pumpkin pie! Both! Anyone feeling warmer yet? I'm cooking! I wonder what Susan's doing? Susan's thinking about us, thinking about her. Now, we all have to keep each other awake. No exceptions. Daddy? Did you hear the helicopter before? No. When? -On our way up the mountain. -Yeah, we all saw it. Oh, that's good. Then it'll be back. You still got the flares? -Yeah. -Don't be afraid to use them. Even if they don't find us tonight, they'll find us for sure tomorrow. There's no way they can miss the X. The X. That was a good idea. -Hey, Rick? -What? Next time, you can fly us up. -Think I can handle it? -Sure. Whether we're talking about one kid or the whole family maybe hurt, scared, disoriented you know as well as I do, the bodies could be a mile from the crash buried under a drift and we wouldn't find them till spring. Here you go. What's that? That's a weather report. It's warmer today. It's good visibility. We'll get all our spotters out. It'll go faster. So, how cold did it get out there last night? About 10 below. What's a 48-hour threshold? No secrets. You promised. It's a rule of thumb that says, if you're lost under these conditions inadequate food and shelter, that your chances of survival drop way off after two days. It's been longer than that. They're alive, and they're not under any snow drifts. -Jack, you can't quit! -We're not quitting. We're in continuous radio contact with snowmobile units. We've got dog teams and medevac standing by. If they're there, we'll find them! They're there. It's okay, Charlie. I'm not cold anymore. -Honey? -Hm? We're gonna get you out, Carla. -No. -Carla! Rick! Rick! Help me get her up. -What? -Help me get her up. Stop it! -Come on. -What's wrong? Come on. Pins and needles. My God! Ricky! Rub his legs. Okay, okay. Tom? Honey? I can't wake him. You know what this is? Hypothermia. Where are you going? I'm going to look for firewood. Wait! Listen, whatever happens, you get home. I'll be back, with the firewood. Rick! Rick, I heard something! I don't hear it, Mom. -No, it's the wind. -Listen! -[ENGINE SOUNDS] -There! Help! Help! We're too far away. You're going to have to go where they are. -Go! Go! -You can do this! Go! Wait! [ENGINE SOUNDS] They're alive, but they're hypothermic, and there's at least one injury. They've had medication, they've had heat but they've been through a lot, so don't expect too much. -Okay. -Are you all right? -Thank you. -Thank yourself. Will you do something for me? -Name it. -Go home! I will if you will. Nice and easy, now, guys. All right, go ahead! Carla! I'm sorry. I'm so glad to see you! Hold up. Hold up! Carla! Mom! How are you feeling? Are you okay? Sweetheart, what you must have been through! Good move missing this trip. Daddy. Daddy, it's Susan. Hi, sweetheart. Daddy, I love you. I love you, too, Sis. We made it, didn't we, Mom? We had to. There's a lot left to do. Hey, happy anniversary. It certainly is.
