[dramatic music] [music continues] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [gunshots] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Now, what in thunderation.. Wait a minute! What're you girls doin' way out here? Well, until you came along, we were going to Sonora. Sonora? What do you know about that? - Did you sell your place? - Well, not exactly. They decided that gambling and dancing were bad for people. Can I make it? Depends on how good you drive. Well, she is a little out of practice. - Slide over. - I'm slidin' all the way over. So am I. Come on, Elaine. What's the difference if we fall in the canyon? Don't talk like that. Nothin' to it once you know how. Trouble is there never was a woman knew how to handle a team. Shouldn't let 'em loose on the road. Uh.. No disrespect meant, Miss Wells. Tsk. (Graham) 'Whoa, there. Now, take it easy and enjoy your ride.' (Mary) 'Thank you, Mr. Graham.' There's dead men in your wagon. Yeah, that's right, you had me so busy I forgot. Come to think of it, you girls better turn around and drive right back to Aspen because the men 'who've killed 'em might still be in this road.' Back to what? Why, back to Aspen, where you came from. Mr. Graham, Aspen doesn't want us. - They threw us out. - They shouldn't have done that. We tried to point that out. It seems it's alright to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon. I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws. Goodbye and thanks. I don't like to see you go. [dramatic music] Thanks, Steve. [metal clanging] - How does she draw? - Little hot. (Sam) 'If you wanna get out of here before noon' maybe you should lend me a hand. Rate you're goin', we'll be here till winter. Yeah, it's only now that you and I miss out the only excitement Aspen's had for months. You're too old to watch such goings-on. - And I am too young. - That's right. (Graham) 'Oh, sheriff!' [metal clanging] We'll both take a look. Anything's better than listening to Sam. Don't forget to shoe that horse. [indistinct chatter] - Who are they? - I don't know. Graham just brought 'em in. Clay, come up here a minute. Hello, sheriff. Graham. Joe. Graham has got something to tell that might interest you. Cal Forster and his sons. Somebody killed 'em. You know that cottonwood grove on Alder Creek? They must've been eating breakfast the way it looked. Just sittin' by the fire eatin' their breakfast. When I got there nothin' but them lyin' dead in their underdrawers. 'No horses or guns or grub.' Cal Froster never did anybody any harm. But what's this got to do with me? I came into town from the south. This was smoldering on the fire. I still don't see. I got it day before yesterday. 'Now, are you interested?' You should be. Maybe Lednov has heard about that Sonora ranch of yours. Maybe he has. We're going to look for him. Wanna come along? I got ten horses to get over the pass before the snow covers the feed. That's more important than looking for Lednov? Like you said, if he knows where my ranch is he'll be waiting on the front porch. I'll drop a line to the sheriff and send orders so to look around for him. Thanks. Who's Lednov? A man I used to know. [indistinct chatter] Forget somethin', Clay? Shells. How much for six boxes? Six times six bits. But wait until I get finished here. You might tell a fellow things especially if the fellow is your brother, seems to me. Like what? Like why're you buying a whole slew of 30-30 shells all of a sudden. Don't wanna run short. (Steve) 'Never said this Lednov name before' 'that I can remember.' No call, too. That jail looked pretty safe to me. - 'How does she feel?' - Nice. [gun clicks] You should know better than to do that, Steve. Unless you're figurin' on buyin' it. One he's got, it's more his size. Oh, but it's leaded up, and anyway a .22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a .22 and where are you? Things to do to stick to rabbits. What was he in jail for? You sure worry that bone. - He killed a fella. - In a fight? Yeah, the fella wasn't even lookin'. This is an awful nice gun. Certainly comes in handy when there's men around who shoot people when they aren't lookin'. Well, I might as well buy it for him otherwise he'd be crying all the way over the hill. [chuckles] I'll get you change. You sure must be plenty worried about this Lednov sneakin' up on us. Think he will? - Yup. - At the ranch maybe? Maybe at the ranch, maybe sooner than that. Do you have to be so close-mouthed about him? I'm your brother and I'm ridin' with you, remember? Alright, I'll tell you. Now say this is the penitentiary. Here's Alder Creek. Here we are in Aspen. This is Sonora. Lednov gets out of jail here and comes along here to Alder Creek. Then he moves along toward the Sonora road. This is Lednov. We come along here-- - And meet him there. - That's right. Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up. - Thanks, Mr. Hayes. - Thank you, Clay. So, let's go. Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov. Yeah. Lednov's only lookin' for one guy. Me. - Why? - He doesn't like me. - What you eatin'? - Lednov. I don't like him. [horses trotting] [instrumental music] Another one, Clay. [music continues] If this keeps up, we can start a store. If things get tough this winter, you'll have somethin' to wear. I'd look good doin' ploughin' in this. Come on, give me a hand. [music continues] - Anybody hurt? - No. We came down the hill a little fast and the wheel broke. Can you fix it for us? [wagon rattling] - What's the matter with her? - Too much excitement I guess. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it? Well, there's not much I can do about it. Jiminy! You sure were lucky, just bustin' a wheel. You think that's all we busted? You should see. - 'Now, where are you going?' - I lost somethin'. Wouldn't happen to be this? Who's the old foe? Give it to me. This must have been in the family a long time. It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells. And this is Helen Carter. How do you do? I'm Clay Phillips. This is my brother, Steve. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. We found your trunk. - Were you doin' the drivin'? - I was at first. Then I was hanging on. You going far? - Yes, ma'am. - As far as Sonora? - Just about. - We're going to Sonora too. So that solves everything. We can ride in your wagon. There's only four of us. I get ten horses to get over the pass. Morgan blood. The best in Nevada. Clay and me have a ranch on the Tuolumne River and we're gonna raise horses like those. They're nice horses, but.. ...they won't be riding in the wagon. Did you ever try takin' a bunch of horses over the Sonora Pass? - It's quite a job. - You can't leave us here. No, I guess I can't. I'll take you as far as the first ranch. What good is it going to do us to get to some ranch? You can stay here if you like. We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble. I'm not running a stage line, ma'am. I can't take a chance on losing those horses. That's right, ma'am, can't afford to lose them horses. They're very important. You let me handle this, Steve. Go and saddle up, will ya? Well, let's get your stuff on the wagon. Like I said, I'll take you as far as the first ranch. I'd like to carry you further, but it's a tough trip and women would just be in the way. Our kind of women? You'll have to drive, except downhill. Come on, honeybunch. We're changing trains. A nice, kind wrangler is letting us ride in his wagon as far as the first ranch. From then on-- - What ranch? - What's the difference? Ask him what ranch. There's plenty of time for that later. Come on, now. You've got to lay down out of this sun. And stop worrying. I'll find out what ranch after a while. Come on up onto the seat, miss, and stretch out. - Which ranch? - What's that? She's worried about where you're taking us. And so am I. Well, it's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt. They'll take you in until you can make other arrangements. So both of you stop worrying. [instrumental music] [indistinct yelling] [music continues] There's a place down a ways, where you and the girls can wash some of that dust off. Thanks, and isn't there something we can do about supper or making the beds? Steve and me, we just roll up in a tarp. Well, you eat, don't you? Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee. Well, where would I find the can opener? In the grub box. Along toward morning, the dew gets pretty heavy so maybe you'd better make your bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under a tarp. The ground won't be so hard. [metal clanging] [horses neighing] Get your rifle. [insects chirping] (Clay) 'Hold it.' Drop your gun. And don't come sneakin' around a man's camp. Fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for some women. 'I found their surrey.' So did I. They were in it. One of them's a friend of mine. She took off this morning. Kind of sudden while I wasn't around. Glad you came along. My name is Clay Phillips. - My brother, Steve. - Hello. Here's a man says he's looking for one of you girls. Jim. Oh, Jim. [sighs] I was roundin' up some stock. That's why I didn't come sooner. 'What do you mean running off without a word?' (Marcia) 'I didn't know who to tell.' 'It all happened so sudden.' - Jim came after me, Mary. - I see he did. With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other. Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen? I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he may call the whole thing off. We've got to stick together like we've always done. I've got a chance to get married. That's what I'm gettin' at. It never works. Don't forget we were thrown out of Aspen. Well, Jim doesn't care. Do you, Jim? Jim isn't the only one you're marrying. He has folks, friends. What are they gonna say? How're they gonna feel? - I tell you, it won't work. - Of course, it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act. Well, look at it this way. What about Jim? Puts him in a sort of a tough spot. I know what I'm doing. My folks got nothin' to do with this. You've, uh, talked this over with them? (Jim) 'They know about Marcia.' And they don't like the idea. Suppose they don't. This is his problem. He's over 21, he wants to marry Marcia and she wants to marry him, so let 'em alone. If you were in his shoes, would you take one of us home? I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it. I would. Steve, I think maybe you better get some more wood for the fire. Would you, Mr. Phillips? Go on, that's a good boy. Well, don't you want him to hear your answer? Well, I know what it is, for the other fellow it's alright, but not for you. All you want to do is to get rid of one of us. (Jim) 'Wait a minute. No need of you two arguin' about this.' We know what we wanna do. Nothin' else makes any difference. 'We want to go home tonight.' 'Will you sell me one of your horses?' I'm sorry, I can't do that. I went a long way to get those horses. Alright, we'll ride double. Come on, Marcia. Is that your kind of reading, Steve? (Steve) Oh, I can't read, ma'am. I just look at the pictures. You can't read? Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he? (Steve) 'Since I was four, ma'am.' But he just never bothered to see that you got any schooling? (Steve) 'Oh, it wasn't Clay's fault, ma'am.' 'We've been movin' around almost all the time.' Maybe when we get to the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then. You don't know your letters? No, ma'am. (Mary) 'Would you like to learn them?' (Steve) I sure would. Well, maybe I could start you out. Oh, that'd be swell. You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be. You're so nice. Did someone say I wasn't nice? Oh, no, nobody said nothing to me. 'Only I got the idea that..' Well, Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancin'. But Clay always took me over to the other side of the street. Time to go to bed, Steve. Goodnight, Miss Wells. Goodnight, Steve. There's a nice boy. Yeah. And I want him to stay that way. Is that why you always took him to the other side of the street? Well, maybe I don't make the grade in some ways but at least I know enough to teach a kid his letters. He doesn't know his letters, no. But he does know the names of animals. And he can tell you what roots to eat when you're clear out of food. He knows the difference between a possum and a coon just by lookin' at the tracks. More than most trappers know. He can tell whether she'll rain or shine tomorrow just by smelling the air tonight. Now, there's a lot of things he doesn't know and I hope he'll never learn. Helen, where's Elaine? She was here a while ago. Elaine! Elaine? Elaine's gone. (Helen) She couldn't have gone far. I wasn't asleep long. - What'd she run off for? - Because she's sick. Stay here. One woman wanderin' around's enough. Don't you worry, Miss Wells. We'll find her. Stick here by the fire. Come on, Steve. Look around. She couldn't be far. Elaine! Elaine! 'Elaine!' [Elaine sobbing] Ma'am, you shouldn't have run off like that. I was about to give up lookin'. Come on, now. You can't stay here. There're snakes and you'll just get sicker. [sobbing] I don't care. Suppose that Lednov was to have found you instead of me.. Why you wouldn't have had a chance. I said I don't care. What's botherin' you anyway? Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already. What's the matter with ya? Don't ask me 'cause I won't tell you. [sobbing] Go away! Oh, don't act so...crazy. [panting] Alright. Let's go. That's a good girl. That's it. Watch out where you're steppin'. That oughta be.. [dramatic music] Down! Lednov. [gun firing] [music continues] Hello, sheriff. You let her take her off our hands? - Who shot who? - Nobody. The light was bad. Steve's. 'What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night?' I don't know. Did you ask her? All I can get out of her is she's tired of livin'. - Look of things, she is. - Yeah. Well, keep a closer eye on her. And him. 'Shootin' going on, we never will find Lednov.' Alright, sheriff. [instrumental music] Well, Steve.. There was only three of them at first. [chuckles] I guess I lost my head. How'd you happen to miss? Oh, they was quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have time to aim. Good thing you didn't. - Clay? - Yeah. Fella can't help gettin' excited once in a while. That's right, Steve. - Can I have my gun back? - Sure. (Clay) 'You'll find it under the wagon seat.' 'Like I said, a .22's more your size.' [instrumental music] Try it again, Steve. ♪ A B C D E F G ♪ ♪ H H.. ♪♪ I. - Gee, I can't. - Why not? You went farther than that last time. I'm too old for it, Miss Wells. That's for little kids. Don't you be silly. Nobody's too old to learn. Okay. ♪ A B C D E F G-- ♪♪ Oh, Steve! Get down back to the horses. They're straggling. He's learning his letters. Yeah, while the horses wander all over the country. Do like I said. Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street. The horses stragglin' or aren't they? They're stragglin'. His letters will keep. (Steve) 'Ha! Get over now.' 'Hoo-hoo!' - Get over now! - Ha! Ha! (Steve) Get over now. [yelling] Get over now. [indistinct chatter] Steve, I want you to learn how to read. I always meant to teach you myself but I never seemed to find time. I always figured when we get settled on the ranch we'd get around to it. Oh, it's alright with me if she teaches you but I don't want you forgettin' your job. I won't again. [Clay yelling] [whistling] This isn't much like other trips we've taken, Steve. For one thing, we've got a wagonload of women. For another, there's a guy wanderin' around hopin' to put a bullet in my back. Okay, I was wrong. You've been sort of close-mouthed about this Lednov. Yeah, I guess I have. Remember Jeff Rawson we used to go huntin' and fishin' with? You were about so high. Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or somethin'. Well, that's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him. Oh, and that was the time you went away. I caught up with Lednov just outside Nogales. He didn't much like the idea of comin' back across the border, but he came. Maybe you should've killed him. Maybe I should've. But I never was much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too fast and I just got him through the shoulder. Then I turned him over to the sheriff and that's the story. Looks pretty peaceful up ahead, Steve. Yeah, it does. But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon? And while you're up there, you might as well find out what comes after K. Go on, get. [thunder rumbling] [rain splattering] Elaine, stop it. Stop! Stop. (Mary) 'Elaine.' She should be in bed where it's dry. Yes, ma'am, she should. The nearest shelter is the white ranch. That's almost five hours away. Can we get a doctor at that ranch? Can't get a doctor, but we can get a roof and some fire. Maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people. [thunder rumbling] [instrumental music] Howdy. My name is Wyatt. You're mighty welcome. Those all the horses you got? (Wyatt) 'Why, yes. Two work horses is all I need.' Mine's gone lame. Take a look at it. Don't just stand there, take a look at it. She dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' it. Put another one on. 'Well, that won't help the stone bruise any.' 'You ain't been around horses much it looks like.' Do what you're told. Alright, but it won't help much. [instrumental music] I was up to my elbows in flour when you boys rolled up. That's why I didn't come out sooner. I hope Ed asked you to stay the night. All we want is somethin' to eat. [music continues] - Take care of that horse? - Yes, the best I could. - 'What are you doin'?' - Lookin' around. These all the shells you got? Put my gun down and get out of here. Let go of him! You listen to your missus. She's got sense. I asked if these are all the shells you got. There's a box on the shelf over the sink. Now, you tend to your business. You hurry up with the grub. [instrumental music] (Steve) 'Get over now.' 'Get over now.' I'll have some more of that coffee. - We gotta get movin'. - What for? Because there's a guy I got to see. Hey, he can wait. Let's stay here until morning. I said let's go. One night here won't matter. Your friend'll still be there. Anyway, I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out, he ain't gonna sit still for it. So there's a guy I gotta see and I'm gonna see him. He gave me something once. So I wouldn't forget. Come on, we're going. [instrumental music] I wish that I had a gun that'd stop him. Hush, Ed. They might come back. [instrumental music] (Steve) 'Slow her down.' [bell dinging] Mr. Wyatt. [footsteps approaching] - 'Who is it?' - Clay Phillips. (Ed) 'Light the lamp, ma.' I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back. - Three men on matched sorrels. - Well, yes. How'd you know? The whole state's looking for 'em. They're lookin' for me. Hello, Mrs. Wyatt. You don't know how good it is to see you. Well, maybe you won't feel that way when I tell you what I stopped in for. I picked up some women on the road. (Mrs. Wyatt) 'Well, tell 'em to come on in.' (Clay) But I'm gonna have to leave 'em here. And, well, they're not exactly the sort of people you're used to. It doesn't matter who they are. One of 'em is sick. Oh, why didn't you say so? Go right out and get her. Ed, build the fire up. Wrap a stove lit in dish towels and bring it in here. This bed's like ice. Put that back. Someone might as well have some good out of it. It isn't as if she was dead. It stays there, understand? [door closes] Right in here, Mr. Phillips. The bed's all ready and wa.. [instrumental music] Go out and make some coffee. Go on. You too, Mr. Phillips. Is she very sick? Get 'em out of here. I won't have 'em in this house. Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here? I didn't know anything about her. Except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Well, let's go. - Wait a minute. - We can't stay here. It's a long walk back to Aspen. Oh, I don't know about you, but I'm not being thrown out on an empty stomach. I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter. That's alright. You didn't know. I won't be able to take her along with me. Nobody asked you to. Just get those other two out of here. Hello, Mr. Wyatt. I don't think you're being quite fair. Where do I put your things? Back in the wagon. - Well, aren't we stayin'? - No, we're not staying. Everything's all mixed up, so don't ask questions. Go on, Steve. (Helen) 'Sit down and eat, why don't you?' It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of. That's not what's worrying me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could've done something gone somewhere else. Putting a poor, sick kid through this. Quit worrying about Elaine. She's home, isn't she? We want to get to Sonora. So worry about that. This will be your room until Mr. Wyatt finds time to take you to the nearest stage line. [clatters] That sounds like him. 'Just remember what you're going out there for.' - Coffee? - No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them. I hope so too. If you're thinkin' on asking me to take you, it's no use. Time like this, people ought to be alone. Having us around is gonna make it sort of difficult. I'm sorry but that's how it's got to be. I suppose it is. It isn't only because it's a tough trip. You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done? I could've very well leave you sittin' there beside the road. You could've treated us like they did in Aspen. But no, you wouldn't do that. It isn't in you to be mean or cruel. No man who brings up a kid like you've brought up Steve could ever be cruel to people. I hope you get everything you want out of life. - Thanks. - You've earned it. The horse ranch in Tuolumne and the girl in the spotted gingham. - The who? - 'You should know.' 'She's in your dream.' 'Ever since you've looked after Steve' 'you've had the dream.' A ranch on the river, good grass good water, barn, corral house that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan to sneak in 'when he isn't looking.' Go on. Tell me more about her. She wears this skiing dress, cooks popovers makes jam in season and makes her own soap out of pig fat and wood ashes. And has cheeks the color of red apples. - I'll make this soap myself. - But the rest is right. Will she be dark or fair? Blond as a new mop and beautiful as the girl on the feedstore calendar. I hope you find her. 'Cause like I said, you've earned your dream. Goodnight. (Helen) 'Well, did you make it interesting?' I tried my best. These things take time. Yeah, and we're running out of that. There's still tomorrow morning. [birds chirping] - 'Those trunks look like ours.' - They are. Well, how long do you think we're gonna have to stay here? Until pa gets around to drivin' us to Minden. - We don't want to go to Minden. - Oh, no. Of course, we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden, we take a stage to Reno then another one to Auburn, another one to Placerville and from there, it's a day's trip to Sonora. Well, Clay could certainly save us a lot of time. He certainly could. About a month. Well, what are you waiting for? Do something. You're not giving up. How many ways can a man say no? Maybe I'd better start workin' on him. You think he'd do it for Elaine's sake at least. No, I guess if you can't bring him around, nobody can. Come on, honey, have another try at him. What's the use? Maybe this time, he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses. You know a man only has so many nos in him. Somehow I think we'll get out of this alright. [door closes] Look at you sitting up already. Here, let me do this while you get some breakfast. - But I like to do it. - Oh, but you're worn out. Now, don't argue, you've got two able-bodied girls to help so take advantage of it. And don't let me catch you touching the dishes. Well, I think it's gonna do all of us a lot of good having a nice, long rest here. After all, Sonora will still be there next month. Helen, why don't you and Mary go on with Clay? He won't take us. Don't you want us around? Of course, I do. But it'd be better for you and-- If you're worried about Mary and me talking too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks we know how to keep our mouth shut. - 'It isn't that--' - Don't talk, drink this. We want to get you well quick so we can all get out of here. But I want to stay. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothin' to do but look at the mountains. - I'm not goin' anywhere. - Maybe.. That's what got you started in the first place. I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying here where I belong. Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. - Stop it. Stop it. - 'Oh, darling.' 'Now, I've got you all upset.' - Go away, please. - 'Don't worry about anything.' 'Mary's gonna talk things over with your folks.' She mustn't do that. - Don't you let her. - There, there-- If she says anything to them, I'll kill her! I don't ever want to leave you. - What have you done to her? - Well, nothing. The poor child's worried about Mary. [breathing heavily] I won't let her say a thing. [door closes] Well, I'm off, Mrs. Wyatt. [sobbing] What's the matter? Don't let them stay here, Clay. They'll spoil everything. Please take them with you. Mary's gonna talk to papa and she's gonna keep talking and talking to me until maybe I won't want to stay. Please take them. - I'd like to, but I-- - But you got to. Don't you understand? They want me with them. 'And they'll fix it so I have to go.' No, they won't. (Steve) 'What comes after Z?' (Mary) 'That's the end of the line.' 'There are no more alphabets from A to Z.' Now, all you have to do is figure out what they mean put together in words. And that's tough, ain't it? Without someone to teach you, it's tough. He knows his alphabet. That's fine. I bet I'd be readin' in a week-- Maybe Clay will take up where I left off. I don't think it's fair. Leavin' 'em here when we could just as well take 'em. We got plenty of room in the wagon. They can cook and drive the horses. They don't bother anybody. - You finished, son? - There's only two of them now. Throw their junk in the wagon. [instrumental music] It's a lot tougher than I figured. Knowing my letters is one thing but making sense out of these words is harder than tracking weasel after rain. And if I do learn to read, what use will it be? I'm gonna live on a ranch. There's plenty of use for reading. You'll see. "U-N-I-C-O-R-N." - What in heck's that? - Um, unicorn. A kind of animal. Unicorn. What do they look like? Mm, sort of like a horse with a horn in the, uh center of its forehead. Horses with horns. - Do we have 'em in Nevada? - No. - How about California? - California neither. Well, would they be good to eat? Well, kind of tough I guess, but you're not liable to hunt for them. I don't think there's any alive now anyway and I.. I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were. Then if it wasn't alive, how could there be an animal? And if you can't hunt 'em and if you could, they'd be tough. What's the use of knowing how to spell 'em? (Mary) 'You don't learn to read to fill your stomach.' 'Poetry for instance.' All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a.. Well, as a bowl of oatmeal. But they make you feel good inside. Oh, I feel good anyway. Don't go arguing with your teacher. I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to it. Lots of things I don't see any sense too. Make up your mind. Learn to read or go on back for the horses. Well, Steve? Now I know what a unicorn is. What do we do next? [instrumental music] [intense music] We'll stay in here till dark. Pull the wagon over. Steve, get hobbles on all those horses right away. Get going. [intense music] We'll camp up ahead. That leg ain't good. [horse snorts] [instrumental music] Where you going? To the other side of this tree? Are we leaving? No, it's too bright. You better get some more sleep. You'll need it later on. You're not going out to look for them. No. All I wanted to do is keep ahead of us. A long way's ahead. I'm going down a ways to pick out a new trail. Nobody's gonna catch him sleepin'. - Don't worry about him. - I wasn't worrying. I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave. You were worried. Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books, so you look at people and figure them out. And you've gotten me all figured out? Sure. Here, I'll fix us something to eat. Like when you were standing there lookin' after Clay. Well, I knew right off what you was thinking 'cause I've been watching you. You were supposed to be reading words. I was doing both. Here. Thanks, Steve. Better not let Clay catch you waitin' on us. Oh, I don't pay any attention to him. I just wait. He's sure easy to get along with. Oh, I don't recollect him having hit me more than a couple of times. - I guess I had it coming. - But you're his brother. And he'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bolt whip on the horses like other wranglers? 'No, sir. Clay is right nice to be around.' He don't chew much. But when he does, he spits outside. Well, you make him sound wonderful. Go on, tell Mary more about him. Steve. - She was only teasing. - Oh, sure. Here, let me take that down to the stream. - No, I'll take it. - Then I'll go with you. Yes, ma'am. [instrumental music] [music continues] (male #1) Hold it. What are you doin' on this trail? (Clay) 'Followin' it. Any reason I shouldn't?' [indistinct chatter] I'm Clay Phillips out of Aspen. My name's Fowler. Camped up up a ways. - You've been having trouble? - Nope. - I don't want any. - Neither do we. That's why we took this trail instead of the main road and traveled all night. (Steve) 'Get over now.' You're welcome to use my camp. Thanks. [instrumental music] Get over now. [music continues] Well, might as well start the fire. You go ahead. Get the trainin' for the pioneer life. I'm gonna find the nearest body of water and climb into it. Got a light? [music continues] [music continues] Uh, want the wagon unloaded, Clay? Uh, just the grub box and the bed rolls. [whistling] I think it'll be swell. When you get older you'll understand things a lot better. Like men and women. Just because a man kisses a girl doesn't mean he.. Well, he can kiss her and not want to have her around all the time. We got a lot of work to do, you and me. Getting that ranch started and everything. And we've been gettin' on fine all these years. For a while, I want to keep it the way it is. How about taking this stuff up and help while I get breakfast? (Fowler) 'What are you doing down here?' Got no business snoopin' around here. Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath. Is there somethin' I shouldn't see? No, but it's mine. I don't want anyone foolin' around with it. Well, what is it? Just a thing I was workin' on. Well, the way you act it must be somethin' pretty secret. Go on, go on, have your bath. That'll beat it. (Mary) 'You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?' Sure. Thanks. - That sure smells good. - I like it. Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder sometimes. Then why stay in the hills? Is that why? Well.. ...I guess you can keep a secret. That's a gold rocker. I'm doin' a little [indistinct] in a place nobody ever thought to look for gold before. Here I'll show you. Look at it. See it shine. That's one week's work there. [instrumental music] You have any cigarette, Clay? [music continues] Thanks. Why didn't you wake me? You should have. I don't like taking things unfinished. Maybe it's better that way. You don't mean that, Clay. [music continues] Tell me, darling. What? What does a man usually tell a girl? Tell me, please. Alright. You don't love me, so let it go at that. Would you expect speeches I don't mean? I didn't expect anything. A minute ago, I hadn't quite wakened up. I'm awake now, go on, say what you wanna say, I'll listen. If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearin' 'em. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy. Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go ahead. Tell me a woman like me can't change. - Alright, it's said. - Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it. (Helen) 'Are you sure there's more where this came from?' Plenty more. Somewhere up, there is the loot. Trucks rotten with it. Pretty, isn't it? All you have to do is shovel sand on that thing and the river does the work. Give it back to him. We're leaving. Maybe you are, I'm not. I'm stayin' here with Jed. Maybe we get along just fine. Well, cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities. Marcia, Elaine, me, all taken care of. Down there feedin' horses, raisin' kids you won't have a thing to worry about. I'm not raisin' horses or kids for anybody. I'm opening up this sleekit gambling house in California with a crystal chandelier. The biggest you ever saw. And gaslights, and a dance hall, and a big bar. And cash registers with bells on 'em and a couple of boys with arm bands just to keep 'em ringing. - What do you think of that? - Sounds fine. Only that is not what's gonna be. 'You won't open any joint.' 'I've been watching you change, Mary, you're mad now' and think you can change back, but you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house. That's it then? (Jed) 'That's it then.' She stayin' here with me for keeps. If there were more men like you, there wouldn't be so many of us. Thanks. It's nice to meet a man who doesn't wanna own a woman from the day she was born I never had the luck. The only kind I run into are tramps or dirty-minded hypocrites. She's aimin' at me, but her aim's bad. You wanna know why I changed my mind about bringin' you along? Because I talked with Elaine, because I was afraid to leave you with decent people. That's why. You'll open your joint, alright, you wouldn't fit anywhere else. Come on, Steve, let's round up the horses. Come on. Let's not keep the people at Sonora waitin'. Mary, honey, I'm sorry, I talked too much as usual. Clay thinks you told Elaine the things I told you-- I don't care what he thinks. [Steve yelling] [Steve whistling] [cowbells ringing] (Steve) 'Hey!' [dramatic music] Clay, look! [music continues] [screams] [music continues] Mary. Mary. Mary. Are you alright? No, I'm not alright, I'm soaked. And I hit my head against.. Oh, my clothes! That's right, worry about your clothes. What about my wagon? Of all the crazy, fool things to do you lose a man's wagon because you're stupid and then you yell about your clothes. For the wagon. Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid! There won't be any rest of the trip. Over that hills is stage road, and when we hit you're gonna get dumped into the first one that comes along. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you when we started. Now, what are you standin' there for? Go out back get the packs and the horses! We've lost all the time we got because of a woman. Go on, do like I said. [dramatic music] We got company. Female company. Yeah. We sure have. [music continues] Jed, you can put these away, they're empty. [music continues] Well, what do you want? I saw your fire, just dropped by to say hello. Well, say it. What's the matter? You restless? Yeah. People make me restless. Even women? There aren't any women around here. I suppose that's your wagon in the river. Some people who went by here lost it. Two men and some women, they put their.. Packed there stuff on the horse and then they went on. - And you're all alone, huh? - Yeah. Suppose I just take a look. Lookin' for somethin'? [chuckles] Hold it, Mac. Get up. Come on. Where did the women go? 'When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.' They went down like I told you. How long ago? Five, six hours maybe. I.. [clatters] (Helen) 'Let go of me!' Oh, you're all alone, huh? - Leave him alone! - Oh, God. Peck on people, will ya? You won't do any pickin' when they come back, you scum! You...dirty murderers! Killin' people when they're sleepin'! - How do you know who we are? - Everybody knows. - Who brought you here? - Oh, stop! You said somebody was coming back. - Ugh, ow! - Who's coming back? Ow, Clay Phillips. [groans] Where is he? Where is he? Up the trail. How far up the trail? I don't know. [yells] I don't know! [groans] [gunshot] [dramatic music] [bells dinging] [whistles] [indistinct yelling] (Clay) 'Steve, take the packs off' and run the horses in the corral. I said take the packs off. I figure we'll make better time if we let the horses rest a spell. So you better grab some sleep while you got the chance. If you wanna go on ahead, I'll be alright. Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses. Why don't you stretch out? I'll build a fire. Make you feel better. Thanks, Steve. If you want them to find us, why don't you go up on the hill and wave a shirt or fire your rifle? - I didn't stop to think, Clay. - You better start. Maybe you and me, we better split up when we hit Sonora. Alright, I hurt your feelings but you know better than to go lightin' fires. That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life. Maybe you're not hungry, but I am. Come on, sit down. Got a couple hours to eat and grab some sleep. I'll eat when I'm good and ready. Kind of feeling your oats this morning, aren't you? I haven't laid a hand on you in a long while but that doesn't mean you're too old. Go ahead. You're so almighty. Always goin' around tellin' people what to do. You ain't even man enough to own up when you're wrong. Go on, hit me. You sit down and eat till I say the word, you do what you're told. You ought to say you're sorry, that's what you ought to do. You keep your nose out of my life, young fella. Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have but I know a sight more about people 'and I wouldn't talk to a mule the way you talk to her.' And if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that. I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid's gonna tell me how to run it. (Steve) 'You think you're so smart.' 'Who are you to sit up there and say' 'nobody's good enough for you?' 'Like you said yesterday' 'just because a man kisses a woman' 'doesn't mean he wants to marry her.' Well, if you didn't mean it, why did you kiss her? You sit down and eat. Stop it, both of you. How long have you fightin' over me? I'm sorry, Steve. You don't know what it is to be sorry. Steve. Mind sortin' out my things? I'm leavin'. 'Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere' 'which is alright with me.' It's going to Sonora. Fine. Maybe I'll see you there sometime. Just like you said, that's where I belong. I said a lot of things. Some of 'em.. (Mary) 'Some of 'em you didn't mean, but most of 'em you did.' [galloping] I don't blame you 'cause I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals but they have to be born on 'em. If they can fall off, they can't climb back on. I can't help how I feel, you're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change. If you're gonna catch that stage, come on. I can't change either, not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand. Come on, hurry up. I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will somebody who wants me as I am. Or maybe walk into the place where I'm workin'. - Take me out of there. - Maybe they will. Whoa. Ho. Mind giving the lady a lift into town? Climb right in. Will you be seeing the sheriff? Depot's right next to his office. Have you got a pencil and a paper I could borrow? - Goodbye, ma'am. - Goodbye, Steve. And don't fight with him anymore. It's not his fault. Just you remember that. It's mine. Don't ask me why, 'cause you wouldn't understand now some day you will. Thanks. - Goodbye. Thanks for the lift. - Goodbye, Mary. If you ever go by the Wyatt Ranch have another talk with Elaine. [whistles] Ha. [dramatic music] You said somethin' about splittin' up. Well, you don't have to wait till we get to Sonora. - You can get outta here now. - You know what she asked me? I don't care what she asked you. She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault. Well, I figured-- I don't care what you figured. Just saddle up and beat it. Half those horses are mine. You'll get your share when we get to the ranch. [music continues] Come on. [music continues] [dramatic music] What'd you come back for? Like I told you, half those horses are mine and I'm here to see that they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguin' and do whatever you figure on doing. Is that the only reason you came back? Sure. What other reason could there be? I just wondered. Get your saddle off and come on. [dramatic music] [music continues] Go on down and take a look around. And get my head blown off? Not me. Call it. Heads. Go on down. You get over that way. [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [footsteps approaching] [gunshots] Stick here, I'm going down the stream. [gun cocks] [gunfire] [gunfire] [gunfire] [gunfire] [gunshot] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gun cocks] [echoing] Alright, come on out, Phillips! [horse neighing] Those horses down there, they don't matter much to me. Look at the one with the bell. [gunshot] [horse neighing] Next time, I won't miss! [gunfire] [gunfire] [gunfire] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunfire] [horse neighing] [gunshot] [horse neighing] [gunshot] [bells dinging] [galloping] [gun cocks] [bells dinging] I'm here, Lednov, come on out! [gunfire] (Lednov) Come and get me! [gunshot] [echoes] Come and get me! [instrumental music] [bells dinging] [music continues] Hold her steady, I'm not hurting you. Maybe you're not, but I'll sure be glad when you stop pokin' me. [footsteps approaching] - Is it very bad? - Of course not. Just a scratch. - What are you doing here? - Holding the lamp. (male #2) 'Well, hold it a little lower.' Thanks for taking over. Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it. He tried to get rid of me too, Miss Wells. Now you be quiet. Put him over there on the couch. He'll be alright. (Clay) Thanks, doc. [music continues] If you need me, I'll be at.. Where you goin'? To the other side of the street. Mary. That job you were talkin' about.. ...did you get it? Why? You said a man had to think enough of you to walk in the place you were workin' and take you out of there. [music continues] Tomorrow, I figured on doing just that. I haven't got the job yet. Do you wanna wait until tomorrow.. Is there any place in town a man can buy some gingham? [music continues]
