‪TRIPLE TROUBLE ‪I had a dream about pastries. ‪Do you think they will have any? ‪Ladies and gentlemen, ‪we're approaching the final station. ‪We're sorry about the delay. ‪Enjoy your time in Poznan. ‪Auntie said we can't be late. ‪Hurry up! ‪Come on, Meatball! ‪Thank you. ‪It's my honor to welcome ‪you to this unique exhibition: ‪The Gems of Poznan. ‪-Do you have invitations? ‪-Yes. ‪Leave your bags there. ‪But the dog can't go inside. ‪Why not? ‪I don't make the rules. ‪Professor Strzalkowska, my aunt ‪the museum's curator, invited us here. ‪This dog is here at her personal request. ‪We'll start with a special work of art. ‪Whenever I look at it, ‪I feel a surge of emotions. ‪Meatball will behave, ‪he's been to many exhibits. ‪Is that so? ‪There is nothing special ‪about it at first glance. ‪-An empty marine landscape. ‪-Excuse me. ‪But this work by Monet, ‪The Beach at Pourville, ‪is very special in one respect. ‪The light. ‪The light of Normandy, ‪captured in a quick sketch. ‪I always feel like I'm there, ‪standing alone, ‪and this solitude... ‪makes me feel good. ‪Sorry. ‪The painting was stolen 20 years ago. ‪Some time ago it was retrieved. ‪After a long and difficult renovation, ‪I hereby give you the most important piece ‪in our exhibition ‪The Gems of Poznan. ‪Meatball! ‪Are you OK? ‪-Julka! ‪-Auntie! ‪-What happened? ‪-I don't know. ‪Mr. Karol, call the police! ‪Hello? I want to report... ‪I want to report Monet's explosion. ‪First name? Claude. ‪Condition? ‪Blown into tiny pieces. ‪No, we don't need an ambulance. ‪It's a painting. ‪The Beach at Pourville. ‪Hi, I'm Fela. ‪Quite the jigsaw puzzle. ‪What? ‪Quite the jigsaw puzzle. ‪This way, please. ‪Detective Rafalski, ‪I'm taking charge here. ‪Secure the evidence. ‪Out of the way! Nowak, security cameras! ‪Now? ‪Tweezers. ‪Who called the police? ‪I did. I think it was a terrorist attack. ‪-Who's responsible for this mess? ‪-I am. ‪I will do everything I can to... ‪Ladies and gentlemen, ‪Poland's collection of paintings ‪has just been dealt a heavy blow. ‪We don't know who dealt it, ‪but we will find out. ‪Those who dared to destroy ‪the only Monet in Poland ‪will be identified... ‪-Excuse me. ‪-Don't interrupt adults. ‪-...and severely... ‪-It's not a Monet! ‪What is this nonsense?! ‪-It's a copy made by my mom. ‪-What?! ‪How is it possible... ‪that a kid realizes it's a copy ‪before adults do? ‪-I just know this painting. ‪-From where? ‪I painted a sailing boat on it. ‪-You did what? ‪-I knew it! ‪I knew there was something ‪wrong with the painting! ‪You painted a boat on a Monet?! ‪Not on a Monet! Don't you get it? ‪I painted it on a copy! ‪That's how I know ‪the original didn't explode. ‪Too early for conclusions. ‪We need to run tests. ‪We don't. ‪I did paint a copy ‪of ‪The Beach ‪a few months ago. ‪We'll talk about the boat at home. ‪Can you please explain ‪how your copy ended up in the museum? ‪No idea. ‪I sent it to a client. ‪Name? ‪I don't remember. I'd have to check. ‪-Your name. ‪-Kaja Ceran. ‪I'm on the Education Team here. ‪-So you had access to the Monet. ‪-How is that relevant? ‪Out of the way! ‪Boss, here! Take a look. ‪Over here. The paper got bent. ‪Right here... 11:00 p.m. ‪Please follow me for a brief résumé. ‪Let's go. ‪One can't argue with statistics. ‪Employees are usually ‪involved in art. thefts from museums. ‪-Ms. Maria Strzałkowska? ‪-Yes. ‪The curator of this exhibition, ‪-and the museum's Art. Director? ‪-That' correct. ‪You're under arrest ‪on suspicion of stealing ‪The Beach At Pourville. ‪Are you out of your mind? ‪You think I blew up the painting? ‪This card reader report ‪clearly states that last night, ‪at 11:32 p.m., ‪you turned off, for four minutes, ‪The Beach's ‪alarm system. ‪I lost my card a while ago. ‪How convenient! ‪I'm taking you to the police station. ‪This must be a mistake. ‪Don't wave your hands in front of my face! ‪-You'll come with us too. ‪-Great! ‪As the author of the copy. ‪-You're staying here. ‪-Auntie! ‪Mom! ‪Meatball! ‪What a dog! ‪What's his name? ‪Meatball. ‪It's my fault. I didn't watch him. ‪He'll be fine. ‪Your girlfriend is worse off. ‪She's not my girlfriend. ‪What if they don't release her? ‪I'll find the thief, the Monet, ‪free auntie and Meatball. ‪Olek will help me. ‪Did you see the way he was looking at her? ‪At Felka? ‪Who does she think she is? ‪A princess? Or a star? ‪She's cool. ‪Cooler than you? ‪Our first investigation ‪was quite dangerous. ‪Your investigation? ‪We broke up a ring of thieves. ‪Julka's aunt was my neighbor then. ‪And so is Julka now, ‪because she moved in with her aunt. ‪Her parents are in Canada ‪and don't want her to join them. ‪-We had to escape... ‪-Wait... ‪Her parents don't want her to join them? ‪I don't think I should ‪be telling you this. ‪Don't talk to her about it. ‪I'm so sorry. ‪Why? ‪Your aunt stole the Monet. What now? ‪-She lost her card. ‪-No way it was her aunt. ‪What did your mom do with the copy? ‪Who bought it? ‪-This is our only lead. ‪-What a mess! ‪Lucyna's curse! ‪-What? ‪-Lucyna's curse. ‪It's our saying for a mishap. ‪Lucyna cursed the museum or something. ‪You're too young... ‪to remember that. ‪But I heard about it a hundred times. ‪You want to know about Lucyna's curse? ‪-We just wanted to see... ‪-Right... ‪It was twenty years ago. ‪Lucyna was in charge of the Monet room. ‪Once came this guy, ‪who looked like a student. ‪He'd pretend to be drawing, ‪but whenever Lucyna left the room, ‪he'd take out a knife and... ‪little by little, ‪cut ‪The Beach‪ out of its frame. ‪What happened next? ‪Lucyna was a fine lady. ‪She always wore high heels. ‪When she was walking back to the room, ‪there would be this sound: ‪click-clack-click. ‪He would stop cutting the canvas, ‪and go back to drawing. ‪There were no cameras. ‪-He dropped off the face of the earth. ‪-She wasn't too sharp then. ‪That's not true. ‪She was our best guard. ‪So what happened to her? ‪She got fired. ‪No museum wanted to hire her, ‪because she got blacklisted. ‪She had a small child. She needed money. ‪So she went ‪to work in the Old Slaughterhouse. ‪STALL 88, OLD SLAUGHTERHOUSE ‪The Old Slaughterhouse? ‪Yes. ‪You asked what happened to my mom's copy. ‪I sent it to the client. ‪At the Old Slaughterhouse. ‪You think Lucyna is involved in this? ‪That's impossible. ‪She was never proven guilty of anything. ‪Detective Rafalski was a technician ‪back then, he'll tell you the same! ‪Goodbye! ‪Hey! Don't forget your bags! ‪-You need anything? ‪-No, thanks. ‪-It's not actually a slaughterhouse. ‪-You thought it was? ‪Let's find Stall 88. ‪Excuse me, where is Stall 88? ‪Eighty-eight? ‪Go to the side gate. ‪It's in front of 320, behind number 11. ‪Great numbering. Thanks! ‪-What will we do if Lucyna is there? ‪-We'll talk to her. ‪She may be a thief. We need a plan. ‪-We'll improvise. ‪-That's not a good plan. ‪Got a better one? ‪Let's go... ‪this way. ‪Julka! ‪Julka! ‪Olek! ‪Fela! Olek! ‪Olek! ‪Julka! ‪Julka! ‪-Julka! ‪-Julka! ‪-Julka! ‪-Julka! ‪-Julka! ‪-Fine, you win! ‪Olek! ‪Hello! ‪Hello! ‪-Hello! ‪-Hi, my dear. ‪I'm lost. ‪How do you get to where people are? ‪I may have whatever it is you need. ‪Actually, I'm looking for Stall 88. ‪I know where it is. ‪You do? ‪Olek! ‪I don't get it. ‪Are you sure it's here? ‪Positive. This is the right stall. ‪TO LET - STAL 88 ‪The stall has long been empty. ‪That's impossible. ‪Believe it or not, there's nothing there. ‪-What about Lucyna? ‪-Who? ‪Lucyna. ‪No-one's been here for a long time. ‪So who bought the painting from your mom? ‪No idea. ‪Lucyna? ‪I haven't seen her for a while. ‪An innocent person could end up in prison. ‪Hold on. Don't go anywhere. ‪Look what I've found. ‪May I? ‪-Thank you. I'm borrowing it. ‪-Wait! ‪Wait! ‪Here you are! ‪This is Stall 88, ‪but there's nothing in there. ‪I know. And I know ‪where we can find Lucyna. ‪How do you know? ‪What are you doing here? ‪Nothing. And you? ‪I've been looking for you. ‪Your mom... ‪She asked me to drive you home. ‪Hi there! ‪Stop! ‪Out of the way! ‪Where? ‪-Why are we running away?! ‪- Exactly! ‪This way! Here! ‪Why are you running away? ‪-I'm running away, because you are. ‪-But you started! ‪Hurry! She wants to kill us! ‪But we haven't done anything to her. ‪-The backseat! ‪-What? Why? ‪-Hurry! ‪-Drive, Karol! ‪Go, go, go! Drive! ‪What are you staring at? ‪-She is crazy! ‪-Did you see her eyes? ‪They're two-colored. ‪She must be after this. ‪You stole it from her? ‪Are you insane? ‪Stop yelling at me. It's from Lucyna! ‪This is our only lead. ‪We can find her. ‪Let me see. ‪ "Greetings from my new job. Lucyna" ‪Who still sends greeting postcards? ‪-The Museum of Nature. ‪-I know where it is. ‪Karol, will you drive us there? ‪I must pop by the museum. ‪You'll wait in the car. ‪-Then we'll go wherever you want. ‪-No way! ‪-We have to talk to Lucyna. ‪-Right. ‪-Lucyna? ‪-The thief. ‪-Museum first. ‪-Yeah, of Nature. ‪Drive us there or I'll start screaming. ‪-Being ten doesn't justify such behavior. ‪-I'm 13. ‪-Again? ‪-Let's open the windows. ‪OK, fine! ‪Just be quiet. ‪Why don't you introduce me, Felka? ‪This is Karol Wroblewski, ‪Deputy Head of the Education Team ‪at the Poznan Art Museum. ‪-Your mom's deputy, that is. ‪-Exactly. ‪He knows everything ‪about the museum. Ask him anything. ‪I'm also the author of the world's best... ‪-...popcorn. ‪-Popcorn, thank you very much. ‪-I have a question. ‪-Go ahead. ‪How many paintings ‪are there in the museum? ‪34342 works. ‪Including 28613 items ‪in the museum's warehouses. ‪-Wow. ‪-I have one too. ‪Shoot. ‪How is it possible... ‪that your most precious painting ‪got stolen? ‪Are you related to Professor Strzalkowska? ‪She's my great-aunt. ‪Yeah, I can tell. ‪There'll be a turn left soon. ‪Why didn't you turn? ‪-Karol! ‪-Hey! ‪-I'm driving you home. ‪- What?! ‪I'm not going there. ‪-We have to get there before it closes. ‪-No way! ‪-What do you mean? ‪-Hey, guys! ‪-What? ‪-We're being followed. ‪Karol! ‪Faster! ‪-Hang on! ‪-Drive! ‪-She's catching up with us! ‪-Faster! ‪We've got to lose her! ‪Everyone's OK? ‪No! No! No! ‪Let's get out of here! ‪I am really sorry. ‪-You've got that postcard? ‪-Yes. ‪-Shouldn't we help Karol? ‪-He'll be fine. Let's go! ‪How long is this going to take? ‪We can end this now. ‪Just tell me where the Monet is. ‪Detective. ‪I gather you think ‪I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer. ‪Someone who switches the alarm off ‪with her own card... ‪If I'd stolen that painting, ‪I would be far away from here by now. ‪Besides, such... ‪arty-crafty scandals ‪are completely not my style. ‪Excuse me, how much longer... ‪is this going to take? ‪I'd like to go back to my daughter. ‪Wait outside, please. ‪-Could I at least... ‪-Wait outside! ‪Get me Nowak. ‪What time does the museum close? ‪It's closed already. ‪We'll go there in the morning. ‪We'll spend the night at my place. ‪This is awesome! ‪You live here? In the middle of nowhere? ‪-Aren't you scared? ‪-Of what? ‪There's my room, and that's my mom's. ‪This used to be a train station? ‪-Yes. ‪-But there's no more trains, right? ‪No. ‪This is awesome! ‪You said that already. ‪Cool paintings! ‪I know. My mom's paintings are amazing. ‪Take a few people, ‪and search her place in the morning. ‪Here's the warrant and address. ‪Just keep it quiet. ‪I don't want you to be seen. ‪You think they worked together? ‪We'll see. ‪Are we looking for the Monet? ‪For anything ‪that has to do with the theft. ‪Yes, sir. ‪It's almost done. ‪And do something about the dog! ‪It's getting on my nerves. ‪Get back here! ‪Police! Freeze! ‪Meatball, come here, boy! ‪Come to me, buddy! ‪Meatball. What are you... ‪Meatball. ‪Take it easy. Calm down. ‪Do you think the police ‪know they have to look for Lucyna? ‪Oh, please. ‪They think my aunt is the thief. ‪That's why we have to do something. ‪What do you think? ‪I... ‪I can't focus. ‪We must talk to her. ‪-Follow her. ‪-Interrogate her. ‪Fela, aren't you... ‪...worried about your mom? ‪I'm not. ‪My mom can handle anything. ‪Olek! ‪Olek! ‪What? ‪-Show me the flea market photos. ‪-Why? ‪We might have missed something. ‪-Ouch! ‪-Wait! ‪Popcorn? For breakfast? ‪Why not? It's summer! ‪What? ‪Do you like it? ‪Sure. ‪Can I ask you something? ‪Yeah. ‪Am I too fat? ‪Why are you suddenly worried about that? ‪- No reason. ‪Hey! ‪I'm starving! ‪How far is the museum? ‪On the other side of the lake. ‪How we get there? ‪You'll see. ‪Olek! ‪This is awesome! ‪Do you have a sailing license? ‪Why? You're scared? ‪I'm not. ‪Lucyna! We're coming for you! ‪What? ‪Do you... like her? ‪Who? Fela? ‪No. ‪Because if you do, it's fine by me. ‪I told you I don't. I don't. ‪OK. ‪Julka! Come here! ‪Coming! ‪-Do you want to steer? ‪-I can't. ‪Come here, I'll show you. ‪Find a spot on the shore ‪and keep sailing at it. ‪Like this? ‪-Very good. Wait, hold this too. Good! ‪That's it? ‪Olek! I can sail! ‪If I had stolen a Monet, ‪I wouldn't go to work the next day. ‪Maybe you would, to pretend all is normal. ‪Nobody would suspect you. ‪If she's not here, ‪at least we'll learn where she lives. ‪Good morning. ‪We're looking for Lucyna. She works here. ‪Hello! ‪-Why can't you just admit it? ‪-Admit what? ‪The way you look at her... ‪You're jealous. ‪Why would I be? ‪She's pretty and confident. ‪-You are being jealous. ‪-I'm not. ‪I just like her. ‪You do? ‪You think I stand a chance with her? ‪I haven't seen anybody. ‪...or an antelope. The hunter would wait. ‪When a lion approaches, ‪the hunter stabs it right in the heart. ‪If hunter misses, ‪the animal is wounded but not killed. ‪The lion runs away, ‪leaving a bloody trace behind. ‪A chase begins. ‪A chase after the lion. ‪The lion must be found. ‪Altai argali. ‪An extremely valuable piece. ‪You're here to see the exhibition? ‪I'll guide you. ‪-We've come for the Monet. ‪-Don't try to worm yourself out of it. ‪Darling, I'd love to help you, but... ‪What are you talking about? ‪You won't find a Monet here. ‪We know you helped with the first theft. ‪You stole ‪The Beach‪ again! ‪Are you sure you have tickets? ‪Aren't you trying... ‪to trick me with this nonsense? ‪Today visiting is free anyway. ‪We know who you are. ‪Oh, this?! I took the first badge I found. ‪I lost mine somewhere, as usual. ‪I'm so sorry. ‪I didn't mean to misinform you. ‪But you know Lucyna? ‪She works here, right? ‪Where is she? Where can we find her? ‪So, how about that tour? ‪There's no time! Where is Lucyna? ‪Lucyna... She's... ‪-She's just... ‪-Yes? ‪Lucyna is dead. ‪What?! ‪-Since when? Yesterday? ‪-No way! ‪Why yesterday? She died three years ago. ‪-Why do you talk to yourself? ‪-I'm practicing. ‪In case somebody visits the museum. ‪Nobody ever does, but you never know. ‪-So, how about that tour? ‪-We're in a hurry. Thanks. ‪-Come on! ‪-Goodbye! ‪An addax from Chad. An incredible piece. ‪It's unique. ‪Come on, just for a moment! ‪- Oh, sorry. I've got it, boss! ‪- Good job. ‪I'll take it to the lab... ‪I'll take care of it. ‪Bring me Ms. Ceran here in an hour. ‪Keep your eyes glued to her. ‪-Strzalkowska can go. ‪-And the dog? ‪The dog can go too. ‪I hear we found the card. ‪Nowak wouldn't give it to me. ‪I'm waiting to run the tests. ‪We all have deadlines. ‪So, may I? ‪I'll take care of it. ‪Make sure nobody disturbs me. ‪Lucyna's dead. We've got nothing. ‪Jesus! ‪I'm glad you're having fun, Olek. ‪Too bad you don't care about our problems? ‪-I care! ‪-We're helping you, aren't we? ‪Fela... ‪Yeah? ‪Your mom painted ‪the copy that the thief used. ‪Yeah, she did. ‪Isn't it strange? ‪-No. My mom paints a lot of copies. ‪-But the thief used ‪her copy! ‪Which she sent to the client. ‪-Yeah, to a burned stall. ‪-So what? ‪Lucyna helped the thief back then. ‪They could have another helper now. ‪-What are you saying? ‪-Didn't you hear Rafalski? ‪Most often the thief ‪works at the museum. Like her mom! ‪So does your aunt. ‪Allright. ‪You're upset, your aunt is at the police... ‪-Because of your mom! ‪-I get it, but... ‪The theft happened because of the copy! ‪-Maybe she really was involved? ‪-Are you crazy? ‪Your aunt is at the police, ‪accused of the theft. ‪She turned the cameras off. ‪Let's talk about that! ‪Good idea! ‪I didn't expect that from you. ‪Neither did I. ‪Hey, no teaming up! ‪Yeah. ‪It's all soaked. ‪-We don't need it anyway. ‪-We can dry it. ‪-Fela! ‪-What? ‪Isn't this...? ‪-Karol! ‪-She was his mom. ‪Lucyna Wrobel. ‪But his name is Wroblewski. ‪-He must have changed it. ‪-Wait. ‪Does this mean he's involved? ‪-You bet! ‪-But 20 years ago he was a kid. ‪But what if it's him this time? ‪What if he took the Monet? ‪-Fela, did you leave the house open? ‪-No. ‪I didn't. ‪What happened here? ‪We've got to call the police. ‪Don't worry. I'll help you. ‪Hi! ‪Hey, buddy! Come here! ‪Hi, what are you doing here? ‪Julka! ‪Auntie! ‪Why is your hair so wet? ‪What happened in here? ‪- A break-in? ‪-No. ‪-The police. ‪-The police? ‪How did you know the security code? ‪I don't know any code. ‪How come your fingerprints were ‪found on the security cameras' panel? ‪My fingerprints? ‪I never touched it. ‪You never touched ‪Prof. Strzalkowska's card either? ‪I didn't. ‪Your fingerprints are on it too. ‪But the Professor lost her card. ‪I don't understand. ‪But I do. ‪I understand more and more. ‪SEARCH WARRANT ‪Julka... ‪They let me go, ‪because they found my card. ‪The card that was used ‪to switch the cameras off. ‪They found it here, in Kaja's atelier. ‪Her fingerprints are on the card. ‪Does this mean ‪that Kaja stole the painting? ‪I need to go to the restroom. ‪Don't try anything. ‪Great. ‪Poor Fela. ‪I'll talk to them. ‪-You're pathetic! ‪-What? ‪Your mom's a thief. Where is it? ‪-What? ‪- She stole the Monet. ‪Leave her alone. ‪She must have worked with Karol. ‪You're delirious. ‪Fela, they found my aunt's card ‪in your house! ‪-What? ‪-With your mom's fingerprints on it. ‪-My mom stole nothing. ‪-She's a thief. ‪-She's not! ‪-She stole that painting! ‪-You're just like her! ‪-You should focus on your parents. ‪No, wait, they left you. ‪And you mean nothing to them! ‪Olek told me. ‪Julka... ‪Don't try anything! ‪Are you OK? ‪Oh, shoot! ‪Shoot! ‪-You're telling him! ‪-No, you are! ‪-I'm not telling him! ‪-Please do. ‪We're not telling him at all. ‪We'll catch her. ‪And? ‪-Mom isn't answering. ‪-And Julka? ‪She isn't either. ‪Where on earth is she? ‪-Are there dangerous animals in the woods? ‪-Sure, grizzly bears. ‪Do you copy, Lena? Over! ‪Oh my gosh! ‪Are you an officer? ‪Did you see anything suspicious? ‪-No. ‪-Let me know if you do. ‪Wait! ‪We're looking for a dangerous... ‪And she's gone! ‪Come in, Lena. So far only one minor. ‪Over. ‪You scared me! ‪I thought it's that policeman. ‪Can you close the door? ‪You ran away from the station! ‪I don't have time to explain now. ‪I need the order ‪for the copy of ‪The Beach. ‪Close the door. ‪I don't have to help you. You're a thief. ‪-I'm not. ‪-I don't believe you! ‪This is the least of my problems now. ‪-Hey, officer! ‪-What are you doing? ‪-Officer! ‪-Stop it! Shush! ‪Listen to me. ‪I'm sure your parents ‪spend lots of time with you. ‪Take you to the movies, ‪out for ice cream, whatever you want. ‪But Felka has only me. ‪Do you understand? ‪If I go to jail, she won't have anybody. ‪What's up? ‪What it is? Did you see anything odd? ‪Well, did you? ‪-No. ‪-Why did you call me then? ‪Because I just remembered something. ‪But it's probably nothing. ‪Anything can be important. Tell me. ‪I saw their boat on the ‪lake on my way back home. ‪Oh, OK. ‪Where was it heading? ‪-To the other side, I guess. ‪-Fine. ‪Thanks. ‪Why didn't you tell him? ‪-It's not true. ‪-What? ‪-It's not true. ‪-What isn't? ‪What you said about my parents. ‪They don't care about me at all. ‪There's nothing to be ashamed of. ‪Do you want me to hug you? ‪Come here. ‪I'm sorry. ‪I'm sorry, Julka. ‪You'll watch ‪all the train and gas stations. ‪And the airport! ‪She'll try to flee the town. ‪-With ‪The Beach. ‪-Yes, sir. ‪Watch her house. ‪She'll try to see her daughter. ‪-Yes, sir. ‪-Now go! Get cracking! ‪Someone's trying to frame me. ‪Do you know who this is? ‪Young Karol. ‪But I don't know her. ‪Lucyna, his mother. ‪Accused of the first theft of the Monet. ‪I remember that story. ‪She's Karol's mother? ‪We checked her. She's dead. ‪Any idea where he can be hiding? ‪Does he have friends? ‪You think Karol stole that painting? ‪Lucyna failed, so Karol tried again. ‪Can someone be helping him? ‪I saw him recently. ‪He was with that strange woman. ‪When I asked him about her... ‪he played dumb. ‪Where did you see them? ‪By the Slaughterhouse. ‪Her eyes were weird. ‪They were different colors. ‪-One was blue, the other... ‪-Brown! ‪The lunatic from the flea market! ‪Olek! You were supposed to keep watch! ‪What now? ‪-I'll stop them. ‪-No. ‪It's going to be fine. Find the painting. ‪-No way! ‪-Fela, it's a good idea. ‪My car is in the back. ‪Felka... ‪Go now! ‪Come, Felka! ‪Check the flea market. ‪I'm going to the police station. ‪Take care of yourselves! ‪-Excuse me. ‪-Hello. ‪Where's that two-color-eyed lady? ‪She just disappeared. ‪-Which way did she go? ‪-How should I know? ‪Meatball! ‪What's the matter? ‪You thief! ‪Stop it, Fela! ‪Where is the painting? ‪Stop kicking! ‪Meeting with the Two-Color-Eyed. ‪Time: 17:28. I'm going in. ‪Oh, it's you! Nice to see you. ‪Where is the Monet? ‪Guess! ‪-‪Give it to me! ‪-Or what? ‪Give me that rug! ‪-‪Let go! ‪-Give it to me! ‪Let it go! No! ‪-The painting was in that rug?! ‪-Why didn't you give it back? ‪- I tried! ‪- Why didn't you tell us? ‪Because I couldn't outshout you, ‪you spoiled brats! ‪Hey, wait! ‪Wait! ‪I know where she is! ‪-Who? ‪-The woman? ‪Yes. ‪I'll drive you. ‪How did you know she had the Monet? ‪For the last five years, ‪I've been trying to find out ‪who stole it the first time around. ‪My mom was innocent. ‪She had nothing to do with it. ‪A few months ago I traced ‪the two-color-eyed woman. ‪I pretended to be her friend, ‪to find out who she was helping. ‪Who cut the Monet out of the frame then. ‪When she asked me for your aunt's card, ‪I understood ‪she was planning another heist. ‪I went to the police, ‪but Rafalski mocked me, ‪because I had no proof. ‪Then the situation got out of control. ‪Two-color-eyed stole the Monet, ‪planted the card in Kaja's atelier. ‪I managed to retrieve ‪the Beach, but not for long. ‪You know the rest of the story. ‪I sent my aunt a pin. ‪Meatball! ‪Nothing. ‪I didn't expect that. ‪She wants to fly away in a plane? ‪No, drive away in a tractor. ‪There it is! ‪See? ‪Everything worked out! ‪-You didn't have to worry, dear brother. ‪-Brother?! ‪I knew it! Somebody had to be helping her. ‪What now? ‪We'll improvise. ‪-We're waiting for the police. ‪-We can't. They'll escape! ‪They're dangerous. ‪Let's wait for the police. ‪Really?! ‪Give me a break. I said I was sorry. ‪Relax, guys. ‪I have an idea! ‪What the hell?! ‪Move away! ‪Out of my way, you punk. ‪Or I'll run you over! ‪Can't hear you! ‪Meatball, do you hear something? ‪Do something! ‪Rafalski?! ‪-I don't get it. ‪-He was helping her all along. ‪-Now? ‪-No, wait. ‪Now! ‪Move away or the propeller ‪will turn you into minced meat. ‪It was you all along? ‪It's all your fault. ‪You tried to steal it years ago! ‪-Give it back! ‪-Let it go! ‪What are you doing?! ‪Let it go! ‪What's going on?! ‪Hold him! ‪Let go! ‪You'll regret that! ‪Be careful, Fela! ‪-Roll it out! ‪-Hold it! ‪Be careful! ‪It's the original! ‪We did it! We got it back! ‪NEWS ‪The Beach at Pourville ‪has been intercepted ‪at a small airport outside Poznan. ‪The arrestee is one of Poznan's finest: ‪Detective Rafalski. ‪The evidence shows ‪that his partner in crime was his sister. ‪The woman managed to escape. ‪The dangerous siblings have been after ‪the only Monet in Poland for 20 years. ‪Back then they failed ‪to steal the precious painting. ‪Tell them about Lucyna! ‪Lucyna was innocent! ‪Don't forget to say that! ‪Now the painting is back in the museum. ‪Lucyna Wrobel, ‪a suspect in the first theft, ‪has been cleared of all charges. ‪That's it for the domestic news. ‪And now, the weather forecast. ‪You can expect a warm, cloudless evening. ‪Wait, Meatball. Now! ‪-Should I take it? ‪-Not yet. ‪Olek. ‪I've got something for you. ‪I guess I'm trying to tell you ‪I'm not angry anymore. ‪You can go to her. ‪Everything will be fine. ‪Promise? ‪Promise. ‪I dream of organizing an exhibition of all ‪the impressionist painters in our museum. ‪-These donuts are for you. ‪-From the Polish police. ‪With our sincere apologies ‪for that shameful... ‪-Outrageous. ‪-...arrest. ‪Let's forget about it. ‪Thank you, they're beautiful! ‪-I made the sprinkles. ‪-And I did the frosting. ‪-Join us, Julka! ‪-Come on! ‪Go for it, girls! ‪Go for it, Felka! ‪Subtitle translation by: Wiktor Garliński
