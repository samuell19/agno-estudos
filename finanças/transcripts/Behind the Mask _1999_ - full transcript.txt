(dramatic music playing) Brian: Sit down, Kim. I'll get the dishes later. Kim: No, Brian. Come on, you're pregnant, and I'm stuffed. No, I am fine. I've been sitting all night. Let's help clear the table. Mary: She's right. If I don't get some help, I'll be here till the Ice Age. You notice my husband's already gone upstairs. Have a cup, Brian. See, I shouldn't open my big mouth. Excuse me. He hates it when someone calls his bluff. Mm-hmm. Just like his father. Hey, Avery. How's it going? Nobody wants to play with me. Not true. I want to play with you, but I'm busy, see? Why don't you do it later? I can't. Gotta get this completed by tomorrow morning. If I don't get it in, no grant money. Center goes bust, kaput. Mary, have you seen that notebook with a little federal ID number? Oh, that's okay. I got it! It'd be all my fault. Be a terrible mess. Avery, don't bother your grandpa. He's busy. Besides, we gotta go. Come on. I'll be right down, Brian. (clears throat) -Is he still up there? What's the matter with him? -Yeah. -You want me to go get him? -Nothing. Nothing. No, no, no, it doesn't matter. He's got a lot on his mind. It's not important. -Mwah. -Goodbye. -Dinner was great. -Oh, thanks. -Thank you. -Nice to see you. -Honey, we gotta go. -Ooh, goodbye, my beautiful boy. Oh, drive carefully. Okay, bye, love you! -(sighs) -Bye! -Bye. -(door shuts) -Bob? -(engine starts) -Bob? -Nearly finished, dear. (sighs) (upbeat music) (people singing) -(people cheering) -Bob, it's Aisha's birthday. Happy birthday, Aisha! Does this mean Aisha has the day off? -All: No! -No! (panting) (sighs) Hi, may I speak with Mr. Garvin, please? Dr. Robert Shushan, Developmental Activity Center. Hey, you forgot about me. No, no, no. We were-- we were going to speak, I thought, a couple-- Ah, no. No, I understand your concerns. No, we're a sheltered workshop for the developmentally disabled, and we have successfully filled loads and loads of service contracts. Absolutely convinced we can fill yours. The price is-- it's negotiable. No, no, no, let me come to you. No, I think it's better we talk face-to-face. Uh, why-- why not right now? Huh? No time like the present. Yeah, absolutely. I'll be there in an hour. -Dana! -Yes! There's the grant application that needs to be copied and messengered no later than 11:00. Cake? (tires screech) (ominous music) (groaning) (tires screech) (door handle rattling) (man grunts) Bob. (heart monitor beeping) Bob. -Hi. -Hmm. Shh, shh, shh. You're in the hospital. Hospital? Mm-hmm. You had a heart attack. (grunts) -Shh. -No. -It's all right. Shh. -Oh. Oh, the contract. -Shh. No, no. Shh. -No... No, the contract. -Contract... -Bob, you've got to let that go. Put it out of your mind right now. You're not well. Gotta give yourself a chance. (gasps) (indistinct PA announcement) Dr. Robert Shushan! Uh, who? Doctor who? Dr. Shushan. He had an accident. Uh... Brian? He brought you those flowers. Aren't they beautiful? Where is he? He had to leave town for work this morning. He said he'd be back as soon as he could. He couldn't stay. Hm-mm. Man: Dr. Shushan! I saved his life. Well, sir, he's in intensive care. I'm sorry, but only his family members are allowed to visit. I saved his life! I found him! It was me! -Sir, why are you yelling? -Excuse me. I'm Dr. Shushan's wife. I am James Jones! (giggles nervously) Yes. I'd like to thank you for what you did, Mr. Jones. Uh, if you'd like, I'll take you to him. That is what I want. (heart monitor beeping) He's very sick, James. He's lucky you found him. Shushan will live. It's not his time to join the great spirit. -(device beeps loudly) -(groans) -(murmurs) -Um, they say that his heart will make little blips-- -(door opens) -James. (door slams) (dramatic music) Woman on PA: Dr. Meyers. Dr. Paul Meyers. Please contact... (birds chirping) (TV on, indistinct) You're sulking. Goes with the diet. I think it's therapeutic. Well, why don't you get off that couch and move around a little? Been home for over a week. The doctor wants you exercising. Maybe we should make love. Just joking. I don't see the humor. I almost lost you. I don't think we have another chance if this happens again. Fine, Mary. Your food's in the fridge. I'll be back soon. I'll stop by the shop and pick up the car if it's ready. How long you gonna be? I don't know. A few hours. Call Brian. Why don't you call Brian and tell him to call me? Call Brian. (gentle orchestral music) (indistinct chatter) -Sorry I'm late. -Hi. Boy, you look great, considering all you've been through. The flowers were very beautiful. Thank you. Oh, yeah, you're welcome. You had to go to town. Yeah, I'm sorry. I-- I had to... I had to lock in that... bid, and then when I got back, it was just crazy. I-- I meant to visit you, but I-- I've been nuts. (chuckling) No, I know, I know, I know. You hear the one about the fellow who came into the bar and yelled at the bartender, "Quick, give me 10 martinis," and the bartender looks at him and puts 10 martinis out on the bar, and he starts drinking them really fast, two, three, four, five, like that. And the bartender says, "Hey, slow down. I wouldn't drink 'em that fast if I were you." And the fella says... (slurping) "You'd drink 'em this fast if you had what I have." And the bartender says... "What do you have?" And he says... "Fifty cents." (both chuckle) That's good. (sighs) What is wrong, Brian? Nothing's wrong. Boy, oh, boy. I don't know how you ever got so angry. I'm not angry. Well, it has to be fixed. Whatever it is that's wrong between us, it has to be fixed. Why? I-- I don't understand. Why-- Why does it have to be fixed? That's an appalling question. No, it's not. It's a-- It's a-- It's a good question. Dad, whatever this is... what-- whatever our relationship has become, it works. You know? We-- We don't fight. We're polite. We do holidays together. We-- We get along. We have peace. It's pretty good. A lot of people don't have that. I just-- I just thought that after-- I can't-- I can't-- I don't have time. -Sir. Sir. Excuse me. -Yes, sir. Uh, can I order? I'm-- I'm pressed for time. Waiter: I'll be right there. Brian: What do you want? Mary, if I don't have my work, I might just as well be dead. All I know is work. All you know. You know what I mean. I promise you, I will get some time off. I'm not talking about a vacation. I'm talking about us. Us? The two of us? Us. Us. And "us" is not us if one of us is dead. Oh, please. People have heart attacks all the time, and they go back to work. (all cheering) Welcome back, Doctor! Great to see you. All right! We missed you! -I bet. -It was very relaxing. -(laughs) -Yeah. Uh, look, Geller wants to see you, uh, whenever you feel up to it. Okay, good. Okay, good. Hi, Grace! Hi. (phone rings) Woman: One moment, please. (phones ringing) Bob. (laughs) So good to see you back. Oh, good to be back. I can't just sit. Come on in. Have a seat. Sure. Thanks. I mean, I-- I feel great, actually. I mean, I should have been doing the exercise. This just gives me a little more incentive. Of course. Hey, how's Mary handling all this? Oh, she's a trooper. But I'm-- I'm fine. Good. You know, I-- I wouldn't minimize this. You know, Bob... your work here over the the decades has been an enormous effort. And I know that everyone that sits on the board, including myself, are deeply indebted. Well, I just... get up and go to work like anybody else. But that's, uh, thank you. That's very comforting. Very, very flattering. Well, it needed to be said. Your illness was a real wake-up call for us. Was a wake-up call for you guys? Yeah. I mean, the center depends on you, which is why the board has come to some collective decisions. We want to find a way to maintain the same level of leadership you've shown us. Will you help us in return? Uh... I'll... I'll do anything for the center. What-- What, uh... What-- What can I do? (indistinct chatter) -You knew? -Well, I guessed. I mean, you're close to retirement-- 37 years. That son of a... "We want you to leave, Bob. But before you go, find your replacement." That's like a firing squad getting you to dig your own grave before they shoot you! (mutters) Man: It's lunchtime! It's lunchtime, and I need help! Uh, what kind of help? I forgot my lunch! -Well, I'm sorry about that. -I forgot my lunch! I saved your life. You-- You should buy me lunch, Dr. Shushan. Might have been quicker if we'd done this as takeout. I like it here! No need to yell, James. You're an angry man today. I am. Why? -Doesn't concern you. -Confide! You are disturbing other people, James. That is not acceptable. I love everybody. Blessed be all who walk in the Kingdom of God! Tell me why you're angry. I saved your life. We're like-- We're like blood brothers! I know you. Heh. You work too hard. The people at the center don't help you. (scoffs) The people at the center canned me. They fired me. (mutters) (silverware clattering loudly) How can they fire Dr. Shushan? The world should know what you have done! -It's not right. They can't fire you! -We're gonna have to go. Can I have my bill, please? Sorry about this. How could you let them fire you? You let them fire you! I didn't let them fire me! I didn't have any choice, James. Well, we will stop them! We will stop them. No, we will talk to them. They don't know what they're doing! We're gonna go talk to them. We will go back to the center... -No, injustice! Injustice! -Oh, shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! (James whimpers softly) (traffic noise) (sighs) Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me, ma'am. (indistinct chatter) Yeah, in this box right here. (distant train whistle) (grunts) Hey. Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? -I'm helping. -Well, knock it off. All that stuff's got to go to the next stop. You took it out. You put it back. Go on. Let's go, Wolfman. Hello? (grunts) (faint chatter) How was your lunch with Mr. Jones? Do they have an interview appointment scheduled for my replacement? Yeah. Tomorrow. I want a desk! I have to have a desk! -I have to have a desk! -Whoa. What? A desk! I want one! I don't understand. You want someplace to write something down? Yeah! No! I-- I don't know! I just-- I just need to have a desk. This isn't a desk, but if you want to write something-- I said a desk! It's gotta be a desk! You're getting fired, give me your desk! (whimpers softly) (grunting) Crazy. (laughing) Desk. Desk to sit at. Desk. Desk. Desk. Desk. Desk to sit at. Desk to sit at. Desk to sit at. -James. James. James. -Desk. I'm sorry I yelled at you at lunch. Do I get a desk? Doesn't have to be your desk. Any desk would do. What do you want a desk for? Hmm? Two cases... toilet paper! Two cases paper towels! One case, not two! See what happens? One case, not two! This is what you get without without a desk! -Calm down, James. -You-- You get it wrong! Y-You get everything wrong. You only get one damn case! 'Cause... 'Cause they-- they won't listen. Who won't listen? Nobody! People don't listen because you don't make them listen. You have to present yourself in a different light. Light! Okay, forget about light. It's not light. It's you. It's how you are, what you look like, how you sound. This is who I am. I'm-- I'm James Jones. I got Cherokee blood in my veins! And-- and if people don't like it, -they can just-- -They can what? They can leave you alone? They can not listen? What? Let me-- Let me try something here. See how straight that broom is? Okay, hold that broom. Stand straight with it. Here, take it in your hand. People don't care what I look like. Yes, they do. Believe me. Now, take the broom. (sniffles) Okay. There you go. Now hold it up a little higher. Put your shoulder blades together. Keep it straight. Straight. Get your forehead back, get your chin up. That's it. You feel straight? Okay, now start walking. Try walking straight. Good. (chuckles) Good. (laughs) Yeah. I'm walking. I'm walking like a damn supervisor! Yeah, now people will listen to you. -Yeah. -Yeah! Walking like a guy somebody'd be listening to. Yeah. Now do I get a desk? (gentle piano music) -Attaboy, Brian. -Dad! Dad! -(phone ringing) -You just have to get the kite up in the air. If you hold the line, it's probably better. Let me come, and I'll hold the kite for you, and-- -I can't get it-- -Hold on a second, Brian. There's the phone. -Can you help me? -Hello? -Dad, come here! -Hello! Hey, I thought you had forgotten about me. -You couldn't forget about... -Dad, come here! (laughs) I'm your man. I'll be right there... -Brian: Dad where are you? -I have nothing else to do. -I'll see you right away. -Dad, where are you?! (clock ticking) (sighs) (clock chiming softly) I'm so sorry, Mary. I let you down. Can't figure out how it happened. I've been looking back at my life, and I have... no idea how I got to this place. I-- I showed somebody how to stand up straight today. James Jones, the fellow who pulled me out of the car. I showed him how to stand up straight. And he was so happy. I don't understand. Well, it's-- it's what I started out doing, it was what I wanted to do with my life, show people how to use the outside of themselves, how to change the way they look, the way people looked at them so that they could... -free the inside of themselves. -Mm. Uh, good self-esteem and... confidence. I've wasted all these years pushing papers, and... applying for grants and looking at budgets. I've become an administrator, a bureaucrat. I've hurt everyone I ever loved... (crying) doing something I never intended to do in the first place. Oy... (sighs) I think I've lost my soul, Mary. And I have no idea how I can get it back. (sighs) (indistinct chatter) Magna cum laude. And you have a master's degree from the Northwestern School of Business. That's very impressive. Thank you. But there's more to this than just administration. I mean, you have to be hands-on with these people. It requires-- you have to use instinct. -You have to have passion. -Mm-hmm. I understand. And some of them are profoundly disabled, and that requires a... ...a great deal of patience. Of course. But I think I'm well equipped to function along those lines. Yeah, well, confidence is a good thing. Who the hell keeps stuffing shoes in the damn toilet?! -James. -I my work hard! I can't take this! You're interrupting. You're not listening, just like everybody else! Walk away, James. We'll talk about it later. -I saved your life! -Get out! (James groans loudly) (chuckling) Well, that's kind of what I mean about... Oh, did you get that on your suit? Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, does it smell? Ohh. You're angry. Well, you yelled! You yelled too, so we're even, but that's not why you're angry. Why are you angry, James? Because people won't give you a desk? 'Cause people won't listen to you? Why? Say it. Say what you're thinking. I want to be the... I want to be the kind of person that-- that... that my father would be proud of! What kind of a person is that? Somebody that people listen to. Somebody that sits at a desk... like you! I'm sure your father loves you, James. Not love! Uh, proud! I want my father to be proud of me. Bob: And he isn't? I haven't... I haven't seen my father since I was... six years old. Then he's not a part of your life, James. But he is near, and-- and we will see each other soon! It's-- It's part of the great destiny. Great Destiny? Yeah. Things that have to happen, things that-- that will happen. Bob: And you want to be ready? Ready. Yeah. He will-- He will look at me... And he will be... he will be happy it is me. Proud of me. I wanna be ready. This has been a good conversation, James. (indistinct chatter) I need James Jones's file. Why? Mr. Jones is a walking catastrophe. He has bounced around the system his entire life, and that is because nobody can handle him. He is defensive, he is recalcitrant, and he has been known to be violent. I'm a big boy, Dana. You know, you don't owe him anything. I'll get you the file. (toilet flushing) James? -James? -(grunts) I've come to the conclusion that you're absolutely right about having a desk. -What? -I think it's important that you have a desk. A desk? You better believe it. Then I-- Then I can sit down. I'll have-- I'll have paper. I'll have pencils. I-- I could have a phone. (chuckling) Wait, hang on a second. It-- It's going to happen, but you're going to have to earn it. Okay, then I'll work harder. No, no, that's not what I mean. Not work. It's you. You're going to have to earn it by getting yourself cleaned up. Gonna have to take a shower every day, you're gonna have to get new clothes, get a haircut, something done about that beard. -Okay? -Well, I can't do all that. Sure, you can. No, you don't-- you don't understand. Talk to me, James. It's too hard! It's too many words! Well then, how can I understand? Follow me, Dr. Shushan. Hurry up, Dr. Shushan. James! Where are you taking me? -Hold on tight, Dr. Shushan! -Okay. Don't let anybody pick your pocket! I'm right behind you, James. You don't need to yell. Oh Lord, Our Savior, bless this bus and all who ride within! (speaking Spanish) Hold it down, James. And keep Dr. Shushan from getting shot! Or knifed! Or robbed! -Hey, Wolf Man! What's up? -(James shouts) That dude has his shots, man. (laughs) See, Dr. Shushan? Around here, you can't walk like a supervisor. Unless you're a cop. Gotta walk tough. You gotta be tough. -Man: Nice jacket, man. -(high-pitched shout) -(men laugh) -Why I studied karate. (distant sirens) (car alarm blaring, men talking) (door buzzes) -James? -Yeah. And just who might you be? I'm Dr. Robert Shushan. I'm a friend of James'. I didn't know James had friends. Dr. Shushan runs the center, Mrs. Flowers. He's-- He's a great man. -Why is he here? -To see my life. I run a good home. Understand? If you are some kind of an inspector-- Pl-Please. No. Uh... James is right. I'm here to find out more about James. Follow me, Dr. Shushan. Excuse me, please. Thank you. (footsteps ascending stairs) (distant siren wails) (young man groaning softly) You got to keep your covers on, Bobby. (gentle orchestral music) (Bobby grunting softly) What is this, James? (Bobby grunting softly) This here is Jesus Christ. That's a cross. And this is the good book. I'm studying to be a minister 'cause I believe in God. Who is this? Maybe my father. My father is, uh, is a full-blooded Cherokee Indian. He's strong. I'm gonna meet him. My father. Someday. (soft orchestral music plays) Holy cow, sweetheart. You scared the li-- Where have you been, Bob? Where have I been? You won't believe... I thought you had another heart attack. You can't pick up a phone? No, no, there was no phone where I was. You left your car at the center. I found Dana at home. She didn't know where you were. She said you'd been fired. No, uh, I'm-- I'm being eased out. I'm being eased out. I've got to find my own-- I'm not the mother of your son. I am not someone who's been physically or mentally challenged. So what am I? -What-- What are you? -What am I? -What am I to you? -You're my wife, Mary. I have a little piece of paper that says that, but I don't feel like your wife or your partner. I feel like something you scraped off your shoe. Mary, I'm-- I'm so-- I'm-- I just realized I'm beginning to-- I mean, I'm out of it now, but I've-- I've-- I have been going through... -a mid-life crisis. -Midlife crisis? -Midlife. -You're going to live to 120? No, it's not a joke, Mary. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me fresh. I've been fired. I'm out of there. I mean, I have the one thing to do with James, the fella who pulled me out of the car. I owe it to him, and I-- I owe it to myself, but-- but then it's... Goodbye, Geller. Goodbye center. It's just you and me. I love you, sweetheart. I love you, Mary. I don't want to go along with this and find out down the road it's the same. I don't want to wait. I want to be with you now. Look, what-- what I've been doing with James tonight, it's what I talked to you about the other night. It's, uh... It's what I started out doing. I mean, this-- this has just been-- it's been closure, you know? I'm wrapping up the mess of my life, and I'm starting out again. Just you and me, fresh. I feel, Mary, I feel like a bird. I feel like I'm-- I've never felt like this in my life. Oh, look at you. You're so pretty. Oh, Mary, I love you. (shears buzzing) Barber: Mm-hmm. Oh, be with you in a sec. Grab a seat. Patron: Just... very little. (ominous music) (James groaning softly) (scraping) (mutters) (James groaning softly) (breathing hard) (grunts) -(snipping) -(buzzing) -(shouts) -Man: Oh! -James! -Man: Son of a gun. You got me good, Ed. (seagulls calling, distant siren) (breathing heavily) (church bell clanging) Well, we didn't get very far in there, did we? (exhales) I'm afraid. In the Bible, Samson cut his hair and he became weak. -I can't be weak. -Will you trust me if I tell you that a haircut will not make you weak? He had a razor. He was gonna shave off my beard! No, he was going to trim your beard. That was the idea. No, my beard... Great men have beards. (laughs) I'm not a great man, James. You are great. No, I wish I were, but I'm not great. I'm just an ordinary fella. You remember when you were yelling at me about injustice? That I just let them fire me? Remember? Well, you were right. I-I didn't put up a fight because... with his fancy shirt and him brimming over with confidence, he made me believe that he had the right, that he had the-- the power to do whatever he wanted with me. Fire me, whatever. No matter. Then... you are not strong. No. Not always. But... That's how the world is, James. If you don't... if you don't look like you deserve a desk, you're not going to get that desk. James: Ah, it's too yellow. Too purple. It's way too purple. This is really difficult, James. Wait, wait. Wait. This one's for you, Dr. Shushan. (laughs) James, why should I bother if you are not going to take this seriously? -I am serious. -No, you're not. Just look at this pile. -No suits. -Suits? -You wear a suit. -My father wears a suit. -Great men wear suits. -You don't need a suit. If we could just settle on a shirt and a pair of pants. Suit. Suits is important! James, you're just being silly. I am trying to help you. (shouts) I don't need you to-- to-- to help me walk with a broom no reason! I don't-- I don't need you to tell me to-- to use soap for no reason! You don't-- You don't know what I need. -You need a suit. -No! I need my father. I want to-- I want to-- I want to stand up straight and wear a suit when I see my father. Help me. Help me find my father, Dr. Shushan. That is-- That is what I need. That is all I want. That's all. James. Oh, James. (chair whirring) (gasps) (dentist drills buzzing) -James. James. -Mm-hmm? Think about the desk. The desk. Can you see it? It's a fine desk. Wood. With drawers. You can put things in it. Papers. And it's got a little tray. Slides out. You can put a typewriter on it. The desk, James. Picture the desk. Hi, Dana. Okay... (soft piano music) (laughs) Here you are, sir. (music continues) I dare ya. (crunch) (both laughing) -Teeth still in your mouth? -(both laugh) We gotta get those plans over to Ralph and Sophie so we can get going on these estimates, 'cause they really wanna move. I'll get on it right after lunch. Brian, you all right? Yeah, you know, I just remembered, I gotta return some-- some calls. Why don't you guys go ahead? I'll catch up. -Okay? -All right, man. -I'll be right there. -Okay. (James laughing) (phone ringing) -Hello. -Dr. Shushan? Rosalyn Flowers. I hope you don't mind my calling. I got your number from James. Something wrong? I'd like to introduce you to somebody. Somebody close to James. I think it's important that you two talk. (choir singing) ♪ Where my Savior died ♪ ♪ Down where from cleansing ♪ ♪ Of sin I cried ♪ ♪ There to my heart ♪ ♪ Was the blood ♪ ♪ Applied ♪ -Dr. Shushan. -Yes. I'm the pastor here. Jessie Haynes. -(chuckles) How do you do? -Will you sit with me? Of course. I've been hearing a lot about you from James these days. Quite a character, isn't he? I've been working with him for some time. You know, he has a goal to be an ordained minister one day. Yeah, he told me. I mean, he certainly has a profound religious conviction. -Mm. -Hope he's able to realize it. During the course of his training here, James would often speak of finding his father. And then he stopped, and I asked why. He seems to have found him, and he's you. Oh, boy. (sighs) Well... I-- I can't say that I'm surprised. Certainly I-- I've-- I've never portrayed myself as his father. He has a very vivid imagination. But I think what he's looking for maybe is a guide, a mentor. I think what he's looking for is someone to love. Someone to be his family. I would hate to see him hurt, Dr. Shushan. (indistinct chatter) James. You wanna home with me for supper tonight? Thought it might be a good idea for you to meet my son. -Son? -Yeah, my son Brian. He lives here in town with his family. -He has his own family? -Yeah. He's very busy. I don't see much of him, but he's coming to supper tonight, and I thought it might be nice for you to join us. -Okay? -All right. Okay. I'll give you a lift back to Mrs. Flowers'. You can put on your new suit. -Okay. -Okay. (silverware clinking softly) -(exhales) -(clears throat) I hope Brian's all right. He probably just got hung up at work. They've been really busy there lately, and he likes to be there, watching everything. I like these noodles! Bob: We're glad you like the noodles. I'm eating like a-- like a supervisor. (laughter) James: Better believe it. Would you pass the bread please? Bread. Thank you. Please and thank you. That's-- That's good, young man. (James chuckles) Mrs. Flowers would like you. That's right. -(door opens, closes) -Brian: Hello! Bob: Hey, the prodigal son. Ah. I'm sorry I'm late. We had a bunch of change orders, and then the traffic was crazy. -Hi, sweetheart. -Hi, honey. Hey. Hey. How's school? -Good. -Good. Good. Bob: Brian... Brian, this is James Jones. James, this is my son, Brian. -How do you do, James? -I'm doing okay. Brian wants to shake your hand, James. I, uh, I understand you've been getting along well with my father. You'll have to give me some pointers. (laughter) (Brian chuckles) Uh, How long have you, uh, been at the center, James? (clears throat loudly) James has been working at the center for over eight years, Brian. I just got to know him recently, and we've become friends. -Right, James? -James is a hero. He saved Bob's life, you know? Don't remind him. It's nice to see that-- that something good came out of such a bad thing. James, what is it that you do at the center? (breathes heavily) (groans softly) (clears throat) (James murmurs) -How come he doesn't talk anymore? -Shh. He doesn't have to say anything if he doesn't want to do, honey, okay? -You just eat. Okay? -(groans softly) Maybe James doesn't want to be on display. He's not on display, Brian. (whimpering softly) Those are James's new teeth, and they're-- they're probably un-- Are they uncomfortable, James? (chair clattering) It's okay. James! Wait. Please. Stop! You... you've got a son! Yes, I do. A son with-- with a job, a job with a desk! Yes. He does. A job with a desk. You must be... You must be very proud. Woman: Hi, Sandra. -Well done. -Hi. I need your signature on this. It's been three days. You think he's coming back? No, he's... down at his church. Left his dentures with the pastor. Gonna give him a call? No, I don't think James wants to hear from me. (scoffs) Well, he's just hurting. You just can't sit by. It's not right. He needs you now more than ever. Don't leave it like this, Bob. ♪ It's a highway to heaven ♪ ♪ And none can walk up there ♪ ♪ But the purest heart ♪ ♪ It's a highway to heaven ♪ ♪ I am walking up the King's highway ♪ -♪ I'm walking up ♪ -♪ You need to walk up ♪ -♪ Yes, I'm walking up ♪ -♪ Come on, let's walk on up ♪ -♪ I'm walking up ♪ -♪ Walk on up the King's ♪ -♪ Yes, I'm walking up ♪ -♪ On up the King's ♪ -♪ I'm walking up ♪ -♪ The King's ♪ -♪ The King's ♪ -♪ Yes, I'm walking up ♪ ♪ The King's highway ♪ (cheers and applause) Thanks. That was wonderful. You wanna come up, James? Take your time. (clears throat) We bow. To the glory of the Lord. -We are humble. -(congregation agrees) We are all humble. Woman: Amen, Lord. We take a breath... -...and he is there. -Amen. We make mistakes. Fall down. And he is still there. Yeah. -We are all in his sights. -Man: Amen. -We're all in his heart. -Woman: Oh, yeah. Man: Amen. -Some of us are black. -(murmurs of agreement) -Some of us are white. -(more murmurs of agreement) -Some of us are Cherokee. -Woman: Amen. But in His eyes... We are one. (cheers and applause) No matter what sad things... what bad things try to drag us down to the ground... We can still look up. We can stand up straight, straight and tall, and we will. For the love of God... we will. -Amen. -Amen! -Amen. -(cheers and applause) (indistinct chatter) James, you're so much more independent than I ever dreamt, James. You-- You spoke with the voice of a supervisor up there. The voice God gave you to make people listen. I was... I was so proud. I'm-- I'm so sorry. I was thinking with my head. I wasn't thinking with my heart when I invited you home to supper. I thought maybe it might make your path clearer if I introduced you to my son-- Find my father, Dr. Shushan. I don't know whether I can find your father, James. Try. That's what you always say to me. I will try. I will try with everything I possibly can. Okay? A desk. (laughs) The barber? (James laughing) (both laughing) -Good morning! -James. Here. What are these? Memos! Supervisors give memos. What are they about? About things. Our parish. The place is a mess! Got work to do, Dana! Work to do! (sighs) Regulation FBI. (clears throat) Woman 1: James got his hair cut. Woman 2: I love your hair, James. Woman 3: It's better like he is now. Oh, take a look at James. Woman: Yeah. (clattering) I'll be, uh, out of the way in a minute. You, uh, you take your time. I take my time. I'm out of a job. Can't forget things, though. Oh, don't worry about that. I could do this route in my sleep. Okay, that's it. I'll see you in two weeks. Oh, you gotta be more careful. Gotta take your time. Excuse me? Paper towels and toilet paper are still in the truck. The list. Go ahead. Check the list. By golly, you're right. Double order. I didn't even notice. Well, okay. Good to have someone around to keep me honest. (laughs) (sighs) Trying to find a Gordon Jones without an address. This is one hell of a haystack. Well, we'll get somebody, we'll ask him... He was in the Air Force. He went to Japan... Oh, he's not Caucasian. He's Cherokee. Yes, he's 1/16th Cherokee. Oh, James said his father was a chief. (laughing) 1/16th chief. -James: See what I'm talking about? -Right. This outlet over here. Sparks came out of it once. Really? Follow me. Th-The bathroom. There's a million things wrong in the bathroom. ...69-1680. Yes. Yes. I'd like to speak to a Gordon Jones, please. Oh, he isn't? No. Nothing, like looking through a thousand death certificates to cheer up your day. Well, you can add two more with our names to the list. What's this? James Jones has reported to the city inspector, no less, $7,500 worth of repairs that have to be done now! Well, I'm glad you find this so amusing. I'm sure you can get the board just to chortle about it as well. Well, you have to admit, he's doing his job. Get him to stop the memos. (telephone rings) Shushan. Now? (indistinct chatter) Whoa. You wanted to see me? Yes, Bob. Come on in. Hi, George. We asked you to find your replacement, and, uh... you obviously haven't done it. Well, I knew you were looking. It just seemed better you make the choice. Anybody can do this job. Just need to get a hard-working paper pusher with a half-decent heart, and Dana'll do the rest. Dr. Shushan! I need to find Dr. Shushan. Now's not a good time, James. -Where is he? -Well, he's-- he's meeting with Mr. Geller. He'll be back in a while, okay? (exhales) You've tried our patience, Bob. It's our estimation that you've shirked your day-to-day responsibilities. Oh, no, I don't think so. I think I have just become aware of them. James Jones is parading around here like some sort of supervisor. He's working very hard. He's very proud. You have allowed him to incur thousands of dollars of debt, which the center must now pay. (chuckling) Come on. Those are repairs that should have been made ages ago. I knew you'd have your rationale. This board asked only one thing of you, and that was to find a director to carry on in your footsteps, and you failed us. While squandering your time on some... escapade. You forced my hand, Bob. We found your replacement. Well... You're finished. Geller: All right, let's turn to page 23 of the fiscal budget... (dramatic music) Woman: There. James. What are you doing? Take it back, Dr. Shushan. What's the matter, James? No, take it back. I don't want this desk no more. -Why? -It got you fired. I got you fired. I was already fired, James, and this-- this desk is yours. You've earned it. You keep it. My leaving the center... that's all part of the great destiny, isn't it? But the-- the inspector. "The inspector." Let me tell you something, James. You did the right thing. You do the right thing. You've taught me things, James. -Me? -Yeah, you. I stood up straight today. (both laughing) I just wish that... We're trying to find your father. We're looking for him. I don't know whether we're going to have any luck. I don't even know for sure whether he's still alive. Don't say that, Dr. Shushan! He's out there. I know he's out there. Okay. Okay. Then we'll keep looking. It's late, you want me to give you a lift home? No... I'm gonna finish my work. Good night, James. You stood up straight today, huh? -Yeah. -(laughter) Give me five, Dr. Shushan. Okay. Okay, everybody, let's get this desk back where it belongs, okay? -All: Okay! -Good night, James. Good night, Dr. Shushan. Good night, everybody. All: Good night! Good night, Dr. Shusen. (desk squeaking on floor) (phone ringing) (phone beeps) Mary: Hello? Oh. Uh, Yeah. Hold on a second, please. Honey. Someone says that he's Gordon Jones. -Hello? -(Mary grunts) (seagulls calling) I'm looking for Gordon Jones. He's down there. (pot clattering, water running) Mr. Jones? I'm Bob Shushan. You know my son. Yes, I do. Why are you looking for me? (chuckles) He asked me to find his father. He asked? (sighs) You went through a lot of trouble to find me. I don't get it. What's everybody want? James is a good man, Mr. Jones. He made his way the best he could. He doesn't want anything. Anything except... Well, I was going to say love. Uh, I don't think he wants anything except his father. You-- Do you think you're able to give them that? I don't Why he doesn't hate me. (chuckles) He doesn't hate you. He loves you... unequivocally. How is he? Oh, th-that's a long story. Do you have somewhere we could sit and talk? We brought him home. You can't tell much with a baby, but he wasn't right. When he was two, he grabbed hold of a hot oven rack... and he didn't feel a thing. Just wasn't right. My wife left. Took the other kids and left James with me. I did the best I could. Back in those days, there was nobody to go to, nobody to ask for help. Even if he was like a regular kid... there was no way. Look at me now. It's all I know how to do. What kind of father would I have been? You think I did the wrong thing, don't you? (chuckles) (sighs) I'm probably the last man in the world to be the judge of that, Mr. Jones. (Jones sighs) The whole thing takes courage, doesn't it? Bob: Oh, it sure does, Mr. Jones. It sure does. James. (sighs) We found him. Your father. He's here, living in this city. (exhales sharply) Well, I have-- I have to see him! Take me to him. Take me to him now! No, no, no. Hang on a second. You and me, we have to talk first. No, no, no, we have to see him! We have to call him, and then we have to-- He doesn't have a telephone. He doesn't have a desk job. Doesn't have a car. He's a dishwasher. He doesn't have much of anything. Does he, uh... does he have a beard? (chuckles) No, he doesn't even have a beard. But he has a son. That son is you. (both laughing) Come here. (James chuckling) Ah, God. We found him. (laughing) Dr. Shushan. Uh... Your son, Brian, he should be there. He should be there when I meet my father, so that-- so that... So that you're not alone when-- when I leave you. James... I haven't been much of a father to my son. He can forgive you. I don't know. Dr. Shushan... the son has feelings for his father that never die. Never! That kind of love is forever. He's-- he's waiting to see you, just like I'm-- just like I'm waiting to see my father. (chuckles) (phone ringing, indistinct chatter) Brian: That's fine, it looks great. Just make sure that we have a model, 'cause I know that they need this by Thursday. (indistinct chatter) (chuckles) Just joking. You wanna to come get some air? Uh, why? Dad, this is-- this is not a good time. Well, you sound just like me. Five minutes. (traffic noise) I don't quite know how to begin. Dad, you-- you don't have to do this. Yes, I do. This, uh, father-son thing. It seems to be something that... doesn't give up very easily. Well, here we are. (chuckles) Yeah, here we are. James, he wants his father so much that nothing, no amount of hurt, is going to get in his way. And we found him, and we've, uh, set up a reunion between the two of them. There's the address. He wants you to be there. He just, he, uh... he doesn't want to leave me alone without a... pfft... H-He has no understanding of the kind of problems that we have. Well, he never really knew his father. -That makes it easier? -Yeah, I think it makes it a lot easier. It's a fantasy. It's not real. How can we undo this? Oh, Dad, why are you doing this? You can't undo it. It's done! I didn't have a father. Look, I know you want to be that person, but you're not. You never have been, because you chose to keep yourself apart.. You weren't there in the morning when I woke up. You-- You came home after I went to bed. You... You left me alone. I don't know what I was thinking, I don't-- Well, I don't either. Brian, Wait a minute. Come here. Come here, please. Just-- just-- just for a second, just... (exhales) Please, come here. Come here. My whole life... has been wrong. Wrong. (chuckles) All of it. I mean, it was... I mean, it's easy to blame it on the work. But I wasn't even doing the work I was supposed to do. I had-- I had my head in the sand like a damn ostrich. I mean, I was afraid of... risk. I was afraid of confrontation. I was afraid of adventure. I was afraid of love. I was afraid to love you. I was-- I was afraid to love me. I-I'm sorry. (distant seagulls calling) I'm sorry, too. You better get yourself back to work. Yeah, I gotta go. I should have said thank you. I should have said that. If I'd been... (indistinct chatter on TV) (sighs) He's been locked in his room all morning. He says he'll be down soon. (chuckles) Okay. I have butterflies. (chuckling) Me, too. (footsteps) My Lord! Bob: Holy cow. I'd have shaved that beard myself if I knew you were so handsome, James. (applause) James, you moving out already? My father and me will live-- Now, let's just take it one step at a time, if you please. Today, you meet your father. That's today. I'll take this, put it in your closet. Keep it packed, ready to go. So when that day comes... it'll be there. -Understand? -(James sniffles) Thank you. Thank you Mrs. Flowers. (both chuckling) Now you go on, now. You don't want to be late. I don't want my father to... to be the only one without a beard. (Bob chuckles) I'll be there in a second, James. Bye-bye, James! Man: Bye, James. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Shushan. (chuckles) (light instrumental music) (children playing) It's still early, James. James: Still early. (chuckles) I am... I am happy you are here. (chuckling) Thanks. Thank you, James. Because now, when-- when I leave your father, he won't be alone. Your father is a great man! You should grow a beard. (chuckling) I thought about it. Finding a father seemed to be an important thing to be a part of. Dr. Shushan. Doctor Shushan. That's him, James... That's your father. He's not a... He's not an Indian chief. And he doesn't have a desk. But he is a great man. To me. Because he is my father. Go tell him that. My father. James? Damn you, Dad. (laughing) (dramatic music) (Gordon crying) (both crying) Ohh. Look at ya. You look like an executive. (James laughing) Come on... Kim: Come say hello to Grandma. -Mary: Look at you. -Kim: Oh, look. -(baby cooing) -Mary: Hello, beauty. -Hello. Ohh. -(Kim laughing) (baby cooing) -(chuckles) -Kim: Oh, it's fine. Is this most beautiful child you've ever seen? You look beautiful. (baby cooing) Thank you. Very beautiful. (sighs) I know how it feels, Avery. Young guy swoops in, everybody makes a big fuss. What does he know? -Nothin'. -Nothing. He's gonna grow real fast. He's going to be a real good friend for you. Everybody forgot about me. Ohh. That's a terrible feeling. We have to do something about that. Don't you have to work? Never again. Walk... this way. (laughing) Bob: Faster! (Avery laughing) Faster. There you go! That's it. Keep-- Keep a steady hold on the line. Yeah. (chuckles) Avery: It's flying! Grandpa, look! It's flying! It's flying! Good going, Avery! (Avery laughing) You bought him a kite? (laughing) I bought it for me. Wow, it looks like fun. It is fun. A lot of fun. (Avery laughing) He loves you. Hey, look, Dad, it's flying! Brian: It is a perfect day to fly a kite, isn't it? You're doing great! (Avery laughing) (laughs) Whoa! Whoa, that's great! (gentle piano music) Hey, Dad. How ya doin'? -Damn you! -(laughing) (tearful laughter) Damn you. I missed out on so much happiness that I could have had by you being with me. -I understand. -And it hurt so much, so... I understand. I forgive you. Don't worry. Boy, you're gettin' big, ain't ya? (both laughing) Captioned by Post Haste Digital (baby laughing)
