Even if he asks anything like that, you should meticulously look at Pradeep bro's hands without getting noticed by the Judge and the opposition. OK? If I show like this ONE time, it means 'Yes' If I pat like this TWO times, it is 'No'. Got it? Shamsu will teach you religiously. - He is not going tonight. - But, let Us go Buddy. Pradeep bro, Please consider that I'm a Celebrity Even I know it. - Hey, get it to me and go. - It was somewhere here. - Candles are somewhere in the corner. - Oh! That our Great Celebrity will find. Take care of This Kiddo, OK? Oh dear Ammini, you stop exploring the plate and help me in searching candles. Oh yeah! (Crowd and Lawyers chattering in the court) OP 160/18 Petitioner Sajith Kumar Amminipilla, Respondent Kanthi Shivadasan. Is it a CROSS? Yes, Your Honor! Do you want Encam? My client requests Encam, Your Honor. If so, tell everyone to go outside. Move outside, All of you Fast! Go! Go! Go! Move, You shouldn't stand here. Move! Move! Move! Move! You come and stand here. Didn't I tell you not to peep into the room? Go away from here. What is your name? That I know. Tell me your fullname. Shivadas is your Father's name right? Why didn't you add your husband's name with your name? Is it a mandate to add husband's name with wife's ? Your name itself is Pradeepan Manjodi, right? Manjodi is not your Wife's name know? Then, why didn't you change it? You dislike it when you are called 'Kanthi Sajith Kumar'. This is what I understand. Is it not true? Absolutely False! 'She dislikes it when she is called Kanthi Sajith Kumar' is not true. Right? This says that you've been an irresponsible wife. Also have not understood the likes of the petitioner. - Is it true? - No. That is not true For my client, who had a lot of fantasies about his marital life, as a wife, you could deliver him only disappointment, I say Is it true? - Is it not true? - No. Not true! The sexual life you people shared, is a total failure and, you were avoiding the petitioner, it says. Didn't you hear me? Simply tell that it is true. Sir, the advocate is trying to insult her. Is this a venue to vomit your Bullshit? Why do you hit the roof? Only those written in THIS is been asked. Sex Refusal is a strong ground. Sit R.P. I am trying to prove my ground, Your Honor! What are you trying to prove? Did you peep into their bedroom anytime? Till now, Is it by peeping into bedrooms you won cases? - You.... - Sit R.P. I say that, You don't love the petitioner sincerely, You're deliberately avoiding him, and you're deliberately denying his right of sex in marriage Please don't stand silent Speak on. Do you wanna repeat the question? Not true. I LOVE him. You're not capable of providing a happy marital life to the petitioner. Is it true? The reason why you don't agree to this divorce, is just to deliberately harm the petitioner, Sajith Kumar. and also due to the pressure from outside. Is it not true? Have you loved anyone? Sir, what nonsense is he asking? Like questioning college students? Have you loved anyone? I'm asking you that did you love anyone before marriage? Yes, I've Yes? Then, how many people? This is non sense, sir! - Wait! How many people? Can't count it? Is it that you don't remember the number?

Is it not true? Finished? Yes, Your Honor! Thank you! You can go. R.P.! - Yes! Why are all they here? A tug of war is going on For what? Between a furious couple. - Who won? - No idea. Not your cup of tea Fishy BATHROOM scenes!! This is a COURT bro, Why did you get married? I'm asking you WHY did you get married? Why you are looking here and there? Don't you understand Malayalam?

Go! Alas! What to do with this? What if we meet him at his house? Noop. It will not workout Advocate, what if we move to high court? Fool! Do you even know where the High Court is?

Doesn't it need one more Posting? If it doesn't get solved by one more Posting, I'll move on with the case. - MC 115/18 - Stop! Stop! Stop! Take 160/18 OP 160/18 Petitioner Sajith Kumar Amminipilla, Respondent Kanthi Shivadasan. Next hearing: August 20th! Thank you, sir! God, Is it TRUE? Otherwise also, they can't Stop taking up your case. They are court procedures for it It's just that he put us on the couch. Your case has been taken up. Oh Godspeed! Hey, People around are looking. How crazy? When we take up a case, It is not enough to learn our clients alone. We should study the Defendant Advocate as well. That is the Success Formula. R.P. knows it. He is a Shepherd. Cross Examination is an Art. If you pass in it, you win the Case. It is after knowing the psychology of those in the Box, one should Cross. Sir, Can you make it a little simpler? To make it simple, During Prosecution, Advocate should be like a Theatre Artist. Increasing your voice, and by decreasing it, Also by Staring, Loving, Scaring, Patting, and threatening them. Life is but a walking shadow, A play that stands and flex is always upon the stage There is to heard no more, it is a tale told by an idiot! Two more Large, please. What is that drink he had? Bring me that one to me here! As you know, this is a fabricated guess, Your Honor! Wasting the Court's valuable time. Those who doesn't even know the grounds for Divorce, have come wearing an advocate's coat. Kindly dismiss this case! Sit R.P., We'll find a way out. Does he have any lies left to bring out? Sit R.P. Your Honor, may I? - Yes! One person, an oldie indeed, Everytime... Everyday, he used to tie his goat adjacent to a wall nearby for gracing. What Rubbish is he talking? Are you narrating a story? It is something relevant. One day, the entire wall fell on the goat and it died. The owner of the goat went straight to the court and filed a case. The Judge called up the Owner of the wall and said that You are the Culprit. It's your wall that killed the goat. He said that, the fault lies with the one constructed the wall The one who constructed the wall said that the fault is with the one mixed the Cement When the one mixed the cement was questioned, He said, It is not his fault that the goat died Later, do you know who was held responsible? The one who tied the goat under the wall. That is, the petitioner himself became the culprit. Court ordered to Hang him. Come to the point! - Your Honor! It's an old story. But, my client is in the same situation. Here, 'Goat' is his 'Marriage' The 'Goat Owner' is 'Him'. Please don't give order to Hang him. Please come to the point! - I want to cross examine PW-10 to PW15 While Cross examining new people, am I not liable to know? What the heck is this? Cool down Advocate, Cool down. You don't know the case. It has just been filed. Is it marked? Yes, Your Honor! Do you want all these? They are relevant. August 30, This is just his Gimmicks to earn Publicity. Please don't sway according to his tune. R.P.! Before me, you advocates are irrelevant. Only Petitions matter. Court is not to create problems but to solve them. Did you understand? Like last time, don't come up with Stratagems this time I can listen to Genuine Stuffs only. - R.P. Sir, - Ooh !! Isn't it being a Single player damn boring? You Play as well. We'll see. Yes, I've my Masterplan set ready for the Play. Are you not older than my experiences? You give your best to chase me up. - Where are you? - Bro, I'm here. You just have to give this cover there. Remaining, I've discussed. - You go - OK, I'll call you. Nothing. I'll tell you later. First time in the Judicial history of Kerala, we've an Odd case come up. The system of arranged marriage has been contested in the court by Advocate Pradeepan Manjodi and his client Shajith Kumar Amminipilla The preparators of his marriage, the Matrimony guy, the astrologer, and own family has been sent to Family Court, with the help of Advocate Pradeepan Manjodi by Shajith Kumar Amminipilla. This has never happened in this world before. What the heck if you all talk at a time? - You can't park the car here. - Then, you move it yourself From where the hell has he come? Move! Move! Move! What is this? I'm a famous Broker who has conducted around 400 marriages. Don't we have to live peacefully? - How unfair is this? - First solve this This Fight is not just for Ammini It is for all the youth who suffers from an Arranged Marital Alliance. I represent their Voice. I want JUSTICE. I want DIVORCE. Weren't you the one who checked the Horoscope Matching of Shajith Kumar? - Yes - What was the match scale? 10/10 is the Match. Then, why has he come for the Divorce? Which means you've checked only the Matching part and not the differences. Right? Your name? Shanmugan! Heard me? Mangalam Matrimonial! How many marriages have you conducted? - Who? - You. What a funny question? To such a famous broker, if you ask the number of marriages conducted Numberless they are! How many of them are divorced now? See, Marriage happens at Heaven right? - Aren't we just Mediators? - His as well? Yes, Of course! How do you get the details of marriages happening in the Heaven? Do they call you or send an email? Before marriage, Do you arrange a meeting for the Bride and the Groom? What is the need for that? Because, they are going to see for another lifetime. So, why do they need another venue for that? So, before marriage, you do not provide a venue for the Bride and Groom to meet. Did your son come to you anytime saying that he wants to marry? No Then why did you get him married? Because, we know that he is at his marital age. How come? Did he pass any special signal, informing you that he is at his marital age? Dear Mukesh Kumar, Is you friend Handsome? - Somewhat - What about his wife? Isn't she beautiful? Is there nothing to complaint? There is nothing to complaint about. Yes or No? She is Beautiful only. Then, why is he getting a divorce? Aren't they a perfect match? Aren't they a real Match? Yeah! Now tell me, Is there anything wrong with his wife? No No? Nothing? If I say that there are no reasons for them to get separated, Mukesh Kumar will agree or deny? What? Will you agree? You'll agree or deny? - Will agree - Will AGREE. No, no... Are you the one who conducted this marriage? That is going to get divorced. Don't you know? Tell something. You know about this marriage, then speak something! Why you want to peep your head into these things? Many such marriages will happen in our family All of us have got married like this only. You better inquire about it and come. In Kerala, the rate of Divorce is 700 % It's high time we ponder over the journey of a state with 100% literacy. Are you saying that the problem lies in 'Arranged Marriage'? Don't try to shoot in the dark, dear Advocate Did I tell that? Never! I haven't! If you are not allowing me to talk what I have, then find someone else to bombard your blabbering. - The remaining, I'll tell in Court. - What is the use of saying that? This is a democratic country. Here, we've the right to speak anything. Don't say that. You don't go like that. Please don't go Did you shoot me creating a fuss over there? Yes, I shot it. Post it on Facebook. Let it get VIRAL. OOOhhh!!! To get VIRAL. How Quick-witted? * If I don't get to say what I want, * * you find someone else to bombard your blabbering * * Remaining, I'll tell in Court * I support Arranged Marriage. What Pradeepan advocate says is just his opinion. Since you get support from family, Arranged Marriage is better. In Love Marriage, people can know each other well before marriage. So, in my opinion, that is good. Love Marriage is a lottery of 50-50 chance. 100% I support Arranged Marriage. I support Arranged Marriage. Lemme tell, Love cum Arranged is more good. She did a Love Marriage for which she is suffering now. Always, Love Marriage is good. That will always be a failure. Love or Arranged, Marriage itself is suicidal This is Love, this is Arranged. I'm happy with both. Marriage is a very common affair. Let's find out what is the reason behind his angst? Arranged Married is the only reason for Divorce. I'll never say that. But, if you analyze you can see that, Arranged Marriage is one of the important reasons of marriage. A flower is Blooming It is with similar simplicity, the youth gets married. It looks as if it is to get divorced that they are marrying. Where would the world end up like this? Through this show, we are coming, to know your opinion about the topic You chill. He is coming. Let him come. Come! Come! Come! Why all these have queued up? What is the problem? All of them want Divorce. All Arranged Marriage teams. At this age? Have you loved anyone? No. Couldn't you love anytime? It's fun. Yours was a Love Marriage right? Yes. When I was in school, a girl had gifted me a flower. I gave it directly to my mom. - Then? - Then what? Mom called her and screwed her up. Crazy! How is your Dream girl? Tell me. That's a secret. Cummon, tell me know? Remember our old Actress, Sumalatha! My dream girl resembles her. Sumalatha? a-ha ! Dear advocate, Lemme tell you one dream of mine? What is it? I wanna rock life like you do. with your friends and all Are you asking me to spoil you? A little bit. I've one more desire. What is that?

Who is this? What are you doing? - Hey, How was it? - How was it? I beat him down. - Now you are Man-like. - Shall I give one more? No, no, You have time. You have a lot more to do. Get down. Now go inside and blabber whatever you like Advocate, Dad will beat me for sure. Let him do that. Isn't he your father? What should I tell him? Should an advocate dictate that as well? At least now, get out of that 'Munchkin' impression Did you hear me? That's true. Get me some rice. Stop! Stop! stop! Why are you here? Why have you come here? I've sent one of your Products inside. He missed you it seems. You only spoiled him. I'll show you my true colour. Let the case get over We grew him up with a lot of coddling. He was a Faultless boy. Do you know that? What use? Children shouldn't be forced to grow according to your wish What is the use of growing him like a Broiler Chicken? He is also an individual who has desires and dreams. Only if you understand it, even you can be a part of his life. Are you still gabbling? You come, come, Walk out I say. You wait and see. Leave him Bringing justice? - Leave him be! - Eat, eat well - Enough Mom, enough I'm full Why Kiddo? Silly boy. It is after how many days he is eating from here, mom? Hey Advocate, Start the bike. Start the vehicle, Fast Hey Ammini, don't jump. - What is that? - Start the vehicle advocate, Fast! Fast! Fast! - You tell me the matter. - Yes, I will But, why did you thank him? Why is the matter? Isn't it because they got me married, I could come for divorce? Yes, Is that not why I could meet you? Only after falling into your hands, I started enjoying life? All is Great It is Pradeepan. Yes, Pradeepan - How are things there? - All good, just going to start Remember, you rebuked us saying many things? Only YOUR face is seen on TV now a days. Anyways, you come here tomorrow. We'll discuss about the SEATS. Are you serious? You come dear. We'll talk. What is the matter? It was Party Secretary. - Is it fixed? - Yeah! - Is it? Give him your ID Card Hand me that paper! Okay, I will inform sir. OK. Are you getting divorced? How long have you been married? Sometime. Oh my god! For leaving a Lovely girl like you, he should be beaten up with pestle till death, SATAN. Tell him to Get Lost. You'll get a Lovable person as husband. Aren't you pretty enough? He is not lucky enough to get your Love. I am a Chatterbox, I know Hope you don't mind. Fathima! Come. At least 500 flags should be... Advocate, Be careful! We should win! Okay? Pradeepa, I wanna tell you something. - You all carry on. - OK We'll go there Pradeepa, you are famous not only in Kannur, but in the whole of Kerala. It's true that the youth are crazy about you. That is good enough, But, there is a trap in this. In fact, you are trying to separate two people right? In the opposite side, it is a Girl On a second thought, You are a Villain What do you mean? All you Do, should reflect on Vote, Pradeepa Understood? So, you proceed. Are you not ready? Ready for the argument? The petition submitted here, at a single glance itself, we'll understand that this is baseless. This is not at all accepted by any court of law! Didn't you see the reasons? Snoring it seems. Fatty it seems. In any provision, due to these reasons, do we have the history of giving a divorce? His family tactfully got him married it seems. Was he Dumb? Blind? Here and now, whether he has any problem or not, god only knows Infact, this petition has been filed for harrassing and insulting my party! Hence, this petition may be dismissed by any cost! That's all. Advocate Pradeepan, proceed! Your Honor! Just one single question. Like giving a colour pencil, Like giving a toy, Like giving a dress, Is it possible to gift someone, A Wife? This is Marriage! The secret of happy marriage is finding the right person! I'm not saying that Kanthi is a bad wife. If my client is not able to find happiness in her, Won't it just turn out to be an adjustment alone? Okay. Sometimes, they might adjust also. They can pass on any number of years with this adjustment. But, Can it be called as a 'Life'? I'm never against Arranged Marriage. To satisfy the family and others, when you are forcefully getting married, Is it not a kind of acting? The outcome of a marriage should be a perfectly matching couple, rather than 2 actors.
