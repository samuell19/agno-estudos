( heavy breathing ) BO: Fucking run. Fucking run, Kyle. ( steps running ) ( running continues ) Carol, I've never seen you so concerned about a story before. You okay? Yeah. You want a glass of water or something? No, I'm good. Thanks. This just came in. It's the audio. The whole thing. ( exhales deeply ) BRANDON: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. ERIC: Please, no! No, no, please! BRANDON: And to the republic for which it stands... ERIC: Please don't do this! ( Eric screams ) BRANDON: One nation, under god, indivisible... ERIC: Oh, my god. BRANDON: with liberty and justice for all. This is for you, terrorist motherfuckers! ERIC: No! No! BRANDON: And everybody you killed in 9/11! Our brothers over in Iraq! And in the name of our god, the real god... ERIC: I didn't do anything! This is our revenge. ERIC: No! BRANDON: It's not gonna end until you stop killing my people. ERIC: No, I didn't kill anyone! BRANDON: God bless my country, America. ERIC: I didn't do... BRANDON: Go, get the fucking camera! Do you know what? I'm gonna take a walk. BRANDON: Look down, you son of a bitch. ( screaming ) ( somber music fades up ) ( guitar fades up ) ( school bell rings ) ( indistinct chatter ) I just don't know. What's his problem? ( indistinct chatter ) Yeah, but I don't know. I don't think she'd really like me. Why? Because she used to go out with that idiot? So what? She's not gonna break up with him to go out with me. But what if she did? How great would that be? I'd love to see the look on his stupid face. It would be pretty cool, huh? It'd be awesome. You have to get it, it is the coolest game ever! I swear! Close the door. Man, you say that about every game. Dude, you'll have to beg and beg your mom if you can stay the night this weekend. Want some soda or something? No, I'm cool. Cookies? No. Where is everybody? My dad's at work and my mom took my sister to soccer practice. What? What are you smiling about? You want to see something? See what? It's pretty crazy. Maybe I shouldn't. Come on! Tell me! Okay. But you have to promise that you will not show anybody else. Dude, I promise. All right, come on. BOY #1: I'm telling you. It's really disgusting. BOY #2: Dude, what is it already? BOY #1: You'll see. Just hold on. BOY #2: What is that? Just watch. ( man speaking Arabic ) ( man speaking continues ) ( continues ) ( speaking continues ) ( indistinct chatter ) WHEELER: Brandon? Mr. Wheeler. So how's the family, Brandon? They're good, sir. I heard your brother was serving over in Iraq. Yes, sir. How long has he been there now? It's been about a year now. So? Well, he's a brave, young man. Yeah, he is. I like your brother. So, Brandon, how are you doin' with all this? With what? Well, with him being over there and... Well, to be honest, sir, I kind of wish I was there with him. You know? Watching his back. I miss my brother, so... Well, hopefully the war will be over by the time you finish boot camp. What? You don't think so? You don't hope so? Well, war always seems to be knocking on America's door... and thanks to young men like you, we can answer it. Now, Brandon, do you know why I called you in here today? Yes, sir. What in God's name were you thinking? I wasn't. It was just a stupid joke. You know? There is nothing funny about sending video to another student... of someone getting beheaded. I know, sir. I'm sorry. I know you don't see what the big deal is about all this... but the classroom is no place for political discussions. Now, I tell you, I hope we kick the crap out of those Iraqis over there... but you don't see me discussing it with the rest of the faculty, do you? No, sir. Now I haven't see you in my office since you were a freshman. You've been a pretty good kid. For the most part. What, in God's name, got into your head? I'm sorry, Mr. Wheeler. Well, I'm sorry, Brandon. I hate to have to do this to you, but I have to suspend you. Mr. Wheeler... You gave me no choice. Now I'm gonna have to call your mother, let her know what you did... and I'm gonna send you home. And hopefully when you come back tomorrow you'd have learned a lesson. Mr. Wheeler, do you have to do this? Go home, you can think about this. You think about what you've done. And Brandon, don't think they're gonna be this easy... on you in the Marines. Come on, let's go. Get out of here. Go home. Is there a problem, Mr. O'Leary? Oh, no. There's no problem, Mr. Wheeler, thank you. ( tapping on joystick ) Yo, Brandon? Where's he at? Yo! Yo, Brandon! He's probably upstairs. Yo, we need to talk to Brandon about gettin' one last rage before he gets out of here. Oh, I see you sneak, come on, sneak a sneak. Mike? Dude, I can't cut, man, I got too much shit to do. Oh, like what? Like I gotta get back to class. Shut up! Okay, come on, come on. Stop being such a bitch, all right? I told you I had to go after I dropped you off. Didn't you already get into college? Shut up, dude, I still got finals. Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna piss and then I'm out. Well, you don't have to get all angry about it. I'm not angry. Shut up, dude! All right, I'll see you upstairs. Angry... Look at... Yo. What up? Yo. What up, what up? I heard you were harassing some Arab kid. Who told you that? Your mother, she says "hi," by the way. She give you those earrings your sister left here the other night? What are you? My stepdad? Oh, zing! Oh. Wow. Mike Grossman cuttin' class just to hang out with me. I like it. What up, sneaky sneak? No, man, I gotta take off in a sec. Why? I gotta get back to school. No. I thought you already got accepted into college, Michael. Hey, screw you guys! Just because you don't know what you're doin' after next year... doesn't mean I don't have shit to worry about. No, in our life, we got shit to worry about. Man, I gotta whittle this duck. I gotta make this into a duck, man. I got laundry to do. We got shit to worry about. Seriously. Come on, come on. Have a beer. Mikey, college ain't gonna teach me nothin' I don't already know about. You're just saying that because you got a 650 on the SAT. So? That is so... I didn't want to. I'm gettin' beer. Everyone's having one. Wait, I thought your mom was laying off the sauce. She's a drunk, Bo. You want a beer? Yeah, yeah, sure. Man, I gotta take off in a few. Why? You goin' to school? Yeah, it's true. Dude, I'm shipping off in a few. Just sit down, show some respect, go ahead. We're gonna drink a beer together. All right, whatever. We're gonna drink a beer together. Wow. He's really taking off, isn't he? I know, it's crazy, right? ( scoffs ) Really gonna miss that fool. Marines. The man's got heart. I couldn't do it. No, no, you couldn't. What you tryin' to say, yo? You don't think I could make it? No, I'm not tryin' to say, I think I did say that. Well, I can make it. You can? Yeah. All right, we'll go start running some laps. Let's go, come on. KYLE: No, I'm a sniper. That's what I am. BO: You are? Okay. Only the best. You listening to this? MIKE: Yeah, I'm hearing it. Man, screw both y'all. So, Bo, you really have no plans after high school? No, man, I'm just gonna like chill out... and enjoy not having to do nothing, you know? Not goin' to school or nothin', so relax. Relax, man. That's cool. We're just chillin' out. Oh, thank you, dude. Yup, gratzi. What are you doin'? Giving you a beer. No, no, man. I'm like, shut up. Shut up. Fine. Fine, one, one! One, atta boy, Mikey. All right, glasses up. To Mike going to college. We're gonna miss you, man. I'm going off to war. And you... To bein' boys. To bein' boys. Delinquent boys. Cheers. All right, cheers. ( slams down bottle ) Dude! What the fuck? Is this a garbage can? My fucking bedroom. Pick that up, man! Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec. Pick that up, you moron! Pick it up! No. Pick it up, Kyle, or I'm gonna whack you. You gonna finish that? No, man, I gotta drive. Come on, man. You gotta drive? You've drivin' drunk before. It's one beer. It's one beer. What's wrong, Mikey? For us. You got your period? You want me to chug it? Yes, chug it. All right, I'll chug it. All right! All right! I'll chug it! There you go. I'm so proud. Done. He's not done. Ah, yeah. Cheers. Like a man. Here you go. Guy's drunk already. Congratulations. You guys want to go smoke a blunt? Yeah, let's go. All right. Shotgun. Dude, I cannot believe your dad bought those rims. Right? I could have got a 1200 on my SAT. You can't even spell SAT. Hey, don't get mud on your shoes. Get in the back. Get in the back. Go on. ( engine starts ) Let's go. ( rock music fades up ) All right, where am I taking you? Whether you like it or not, Mikey... you're hanging out with us today. Seriously, Brandon, I gotta go back to school. If my mom finds out I cut, she's gonna kick my ass. She ain't gonna find out. Exactly. Hey, pass that blunt over here. What the fuck, Bo? Shut up, Mike needs to hit that. All right! All right! All right, where are we going? That a boy, Mikey! That a boy. Pass that shit. I told Charlotte we were picking her and a friend up at Pop-In-Go. I hope this one has both legs. Dude... that bitch was such a... Yo, what type of person doesn't drink water? Ever. I don't know, she said she was cool, she's some sophomore chick. Well, the Pop-In-Go it is, Mike! The Pop-In-Go it is. All right. What up, what up, homeless? GIRLS: Ha ha. She's cute. Hey, baby. 'Bout time. You can blame Mike. Yeah. Kyle! Let's go! There's plenty of room for that in the car! Seriously. Kyle, this is my friend Michelle. 'Sup? Hey. Come on. Who's that? He's kind of cute. That's Brandon, yeah. Total hottie. Hey. It looks kind of crowded back there, can I sit with you? Absolutely. KYLE: She's sittin' up front. Yeah, she is. Here, grab that. I'm Brandon. Hey. Michelle. Nice to meet you. And this is Mike. Hey. And Bo. Hey. All right, everybody cool? Yeah. Whoa! ( laughing ) KYLE: This is it! Wow, that shit got me so high. Well, that's normally what happens, baby. Yeah, you get the best shit. What do you think? Oh, my... I am the winner! Thank you. This is the spot! Thank you, sir. You ready? Yeah. All right. Oh, wow. I know, huh? Oh, my god. What do you think? Whoa, this is badass. Bitch. You gotta earn it, darlin'. Oh, do I? Yeah, you earned it. Oh, Jesus Christ! Dude, they're like monkeys, man! Jeez, he's gonna swallow her. Everyone want a beer? There's my boy right there! Hey, I gotta be a good host, right? You two want beer? Yes. Two please, thank you. So, you guys just like come here and chill and stuff? Yeah. We can do whatever we want, whenever we want to. BO: Stand on the table. Who lives here? Nobody, that's the best part. I mean, occasionally you'll see a Mexican field worker... or something like that, but that's about it. So cool. Yeah, yeah. You guys write all this? Mike and I wrote all that. But isn't it like bad to write on the flag? No, that's burning a flag. This is how we show our love. ( bottles clinking ) Hey, you like that? Yeah, she does. That's cool. Thanks, baby. I can't believe you got suspended today. Well, at least we got the day off, right? There you go. Got that blunt already started? Yeah, I'm glad you got suspended, bro. Why are you glad, bro? Because otherwise I would have had to listen to Miss Lopez... talk about all that immigration shit, you know what I mean? Miss Lopez? What am I gonna learn from Lopez? Dude, come on, she's got an agenda just like the rest of 'em. Of course she does, but we don't need some Mexican chick... telling us how to keep our borders open right now. Dude, I think she's Cuban. That doesn't fucking matter. If you want a job, get in line with the rest of us. You fucking selfish, fucking foreigners. Seriously, I don't know why we should care about them anyway. They're not even from here. And did you see how many of them they try to fit on, like, one boat? It's not even a boat. It's like a raft or something. Shit's going down. Like, if we don't do something about it soon... we're just gonna lose control. I heard that, like, by 2025... we're gonna be a minority in our own country. No way. There's no way. Yes, I am serious. Dude, all right, just imagine it. Who in this country has the most kids? Mexicans. Mexicans! They're like illegal immigrants. They come over, they pop eight of them out and they stay. They're American citizens. Dude, think about it. If millions of Chinese people just wanted to go to France... do you think they'd let 'em? Probably, bro. I heard in their schools... that they teach their kids how to surrender. What? Yes, like, "Jean Pierre, get in front of class. "Now, bend over and take it in the ass!" Oh, monsieur! Yo, you got these dudes flying into two towers... killing thousands of American souls and we can't fucking close our borders. That doesn't make sense. It doesn't make me feel safe. Yeah, fuck that. No, but what pisses me off is that they can come over here... and kill how many innocent people... and we haven't went over there yet and killed them... and they're not even fucking innocent. We can go over there and we will. I mean, we need to stop waiting around. We need to go right now! We got a shitload of nukes and we need to fuckin' use 'em! I think that's fair! You know what I mean? Two towers for a nuke. Dude, those fucking people are savages. It's just like the video I got suspended for today. Where that guy was cutting that dude's head off with a gutting knife. You remember the way it sounded? Yes, ugh! Okay, yes, thank you for showing me, Brandon. I will now proceed to have nightmares. Did you see that shit? Yes, I saw that. I do not want to think about that video. It's like, a total buzzkill. 9/11's a buzzkill, but it's a relevant topic. All right, but just enough about the video. Okay. Yo, pass that blunt. It's almost fucking done. CHARLOTTE: How about giving me a tour, baby? I already showed you the whole place. Oh, you want, like the official tour. Yeah, I'm gonna bring her on the official tour. I mean, I didn't show her everything yet. It's magical, Charlotte. Yeah, it's great, the rest of the stuff I didn't show you. This is for the tour. What an idiot. What happens if that Mexican worker comes when we're here? Oh, don't worry, we'll just call immigration. Kick 'em out. Get him on out. Yo, we're out of beer. This is the last one. Yup. I cannot wait until I ship out. I'm gonna get to legally kill every single last one of those rat bastards. What do you have that for? This is a shotgun and it's fun. What are you talking about? Yeah, it's chill. Hey, Mikey, I'm gonna fucking shoot you, you fucking little terrorist. How does this feel? You want me to pull the trigger? You're not gonna do it. I'm not gonna fucking do it. Are you kidding me? I'd fucking laugh so hard if you blew his head off. That's not funny. Hey, I don't know what I'd do if I saw one of those terrorist fuckers, man. Yeah? I'd lose my shit. What would you do? I'd fucking shoot 'em all. Yeah? I think we should just nuke 'em, man. Then y'all are killing innocent people. No, we're not. Innocent people? Did you see them after 9/11? They were running around in the streets, shooting off their guns in the air... parading in celebration of death. That makes all of them terrorists? Yes, certainly does. Are you kidding me? They may not be pulling the trigger... but they sure as hell ain't tryin' to stop them. Yea, I mean, everybody makes a big, freaking deal... about when we accidently kill a few kids over there. It's like, these guys are strapping bombs to their chests... and they're blowing themselves up in a school or something. Yeah, man. They're just like, they're evil motherfuckers. MIKE: Yeah, I know. They're not even the same species. BO: Yeah. MIKE: You know? What the... What's her problem? BO: She's fucking weird. MIKE: Did I say something? BO: No. ( moaning ) Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, let's go. Oh, yeah. Come with me. ( moaning continues ) Wait, baby, stay inside of me. Let's do it again. Watch this, right? I can make my head grow. How do you do that? Can you see that? Yeah. Do it. Right? Had do you... do you just, I don't know how you're doing it. You look constipated. Naw, look at my head grow. Ready, watch, I'll make my head grow. I really don't care. Hold on, let me try one more time, ready? Ready? Do it. You look like you're gonna shit. Well, I don't know, did it work? Did it look like my head was growing? Can we go? Yeah, fine. Kyle! BRANDON: Kyle! We gotta go. Shit. Oh, shit. We gotta go? All right, hold on! Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Okay. BRANDON: Kyle, let's go! Tell him we're coming. Shut up, we're coming! You got it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. ( car horn honking ) Shit. All right. You ready? Yeah. Coming! You okay? His belt's undone. ( honking horn ) All right now. Sorry. ( engine starts ) Your pants on? I got 'em. ( guitar fades up ) BO: Yo, where's the cheese at, rat? ( laughs ) I did it. I said it. Keep walking. That's right. That's right. I'll have the other, too. I can't sell you those. Why not? Why not? I got an ID right here, buddy. Hook it up. Are you serious? Yeah. Look, Brandon, man, I don't want any trouble, okay? Would you please just leave? No, come on, man. Just hook it up. Sell us this beer, since you got me suspended today. What? No, no, no, no. I... you sent me that video. And you fucking ratted on me! No, the teacher was standing right behind me! Yeah, all right. Stop being such a bitch. Fuck you, man! What did you just say? What? What? Huh? I'm sorry, okay? What are you sorry for? What? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to say, "fuck you"! Oh! Oh, man, you're done. Say it again. Say anything. Come on. Whatcha got? What the fuck are you doing? That fucking counts! That... Yo, yo, yo, cops. Cops, son, cops. Brandon, just go, please? Walk away. Walk away. Let's go. Well, lookie here. How you boys doin'? Pretty good, officer. How about yourself? LE BLANC: I'm good. You staying out of trouble? Absolutely. Wouldn't want you to work any harder. That's nice. Brandon! Bo! Get back here a minute. You boys trying to buy beer? No, sir. No. No, sir? What you got there in your pocket? ( sighs ) Come on, Le Blanc. Come on. Shut up, Bo. My wallet, officer. Your wallet. So if I search you right now, I'm not gonna find a fake ID? Don't you have something better to do? Don't I have something better to do. What do you boys think I do for a living? Pick on little kids, I don't know? You better watch your mouth, boy. You think this is funny? The problem with this situation... is I got you boys in my hands now. You're on my watch. You understand that? Yes, sir. I could make my life real simple... put you in the back of the car and take you to the station. Wouldn't have to worry about you all day. We got plenty of room. ( scoffs ) I like you boys. I always have. I like your families. I'd like to see you stay out of trouble. You follow? Yes, sir. All right. Get the hell out of here, I don't want to see you boys again today. I appreciate that, officer. Thank you. Go home. I don't want any. Hey, guys! All right, we're gonna be at Brandon's house playing video games. Yeah. BO: Video games. Hey, Ma. Ssh. It's okay. All right. All right, yes. Okay, Mom. Okay. I love you, too. Seriously, guys, can you be any louder? BO: Sorry, momma. God! BO: She didn't hear me. Whatever, dude. Yeah. You all right? Where's the beer? Fucking Arab that got me suspended today. He wouldn't sell us the beer and the fucking cop took my ID. Wait, wait, wait. You don't have an ID? We don't have beer? Yeah, just chill, chill, man. If we go to school with the guy... why don't we go somewhere else? That's what I'm saying. Why don't you shut your mouth, Michelle. Thank you. MIKE: You all right, Brandon? Kyle, call your brother, see if he can hook us up. ( snickering ) Fine. Let me see your phone, Mike. I really don't feel like calling him, but I will. All right. All right. It's cool, it's no big deal. I'll call me brother and we shall get some beer. Mike... let's go. Get the fuck out of here. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Let's just get some fucking beer. I know. ( music fades up ) BO: Find me a rock, you think I can't skip. MIKE: Yo, dude, how much do you wanna bet I can throw it farther? BO: We're watching you. Seven skips. You faggot. So you're like a big skipper. What did you say? BRANDON: Mike! ( yelling ) ( giggling ) Bye, y'all. Bye, Mike. Bye, baby. Okay, I gotta go. Seriously. KYLE: I know, I know. Charlotte, come on! ( engine starts ) Cut the shit, let's go. ( door shuts ) ( peeling off ) Dude, if I have a little girl... I'm not her out of the house until she's 25 years old. Yeah, I'm gonna super glue her purse. I don't want any girls, man. All boys. I couldn't do girls, man. I'd be all awkward with them and shit. Yeah? You're awkward with them now. No, I mean, like, you know... All right, how badass would it be... if there was a little Kyle Jr. running around getting twisted with us? Man, the world doesn't need any more redheads. Oh, you know what I mean. Just gonna be like a little dude running around... making us sandwiches and rolling us blunts and shit. That would be badass. Yo, Kyle, I hope you wrap it up when you bang your girl. For what? She's only been with three other dudes. ( laughing ) Oh, shit. Yeah, three times three, baby. Dude, she's fucking lying to you, man. No, she's not lying to me. She told me three and she means three. No, Charlotte has no reason to lie to me about that shit. No, they all lie, bro. I could name five dudes she's been with right now. Fuck you, yo! You could not name five dudes right now. Yes, I could. No, don't even try, bitch. She's fucked them all. That is bullshit. No, that's not. No way, man. Flip that, man, whatever. Man, I just can't wait to get to college, because I don't have to deal... with all this high school bullshit. I heard the girls are easy. Oh, yeah, man, that's like the only shit that would get me near a college. Shoot, I'd go to Alaska to get fucking good pussy. Nah, fuck that, cold would make my dick all shriveled up. It can't get much smaller than it already is. All right, Bo, who's getting laid now? All right. No, really, I want to know! 'Cause, I don't know about you... but I don't ever see you with a girl. Couldn't even get with that one-legged ho. Oh, shit. Fuckin' keep it up, Kyle. Keep it up, man. Oh, man. Hey, Brandon, you gonna come visit me at school? No, man, I don't think I'm gonna get the chance. I think I'm gonna be gone. I'd love to, but... Gonna serve my country. No doubt. Yo, yo, yo, stop. Mike, Mike. That's the motherfucker right there from the Pop-In-Go! Go, go, go, turn right. BRANDON: Yo, Osama terrorist motherfucker! Where you going? You gonna go meet Al Qaeda? Where's the principal and the cop to save your ass now, huh? Look what we got. Hey, fuck you, you redneck pieces of shit! Stop the car! Stop the car! Fucking faggot! Fucking faggot! BRANDON: You son of a bitch! Huh? Get him! Get him! Come on! Yeah! Pick him up. Go! Brandon, man, what are you doing? BRANDON: Get in the car! ERIC: What the fuck are you doing? What is this, man? Get in the fucking car! ERIC: What the fuck! Get off me! No! BRANDON: Get him in! Get him! In here! What the fuck are you... Go! BO: You're dead! You're fucking dead! BRANDON: Left. Shut your fucking mouth! Please! Wait, wait! Shut your fucking mouth! Please! Shut the fuck up! You fucked up, so now you're gonna fucking pay for it, all right? I didn't do anything! Please, just fucking let me go! I swear to god, I didn't do anything. Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Goddamn it! You little- Motherfucker! Hurry the fuck up, Mike! I'm getting a little antsy! Gross. Let's play pass the fucking Arab. Brandon, what the hell are you doing? Shut up. No, that's my dad's, I'm not supposed to use it. Listen, I'm just gonna fucking scare the kid. Okay? I'm gonna put it back, you're not gonna get in any fucking trouble. What the fuck, dude? ( laughing ) I don't want to touch him. I'm not gonna fucking carry him by myself. Help him up, dude. He's so gross, man, I don't want to touch him. Pick up the kid! No, he's breathing, I can see. Mike, you want to help me out? Grab his legs. I got him. Aw, fuck, it's muddy. Don't slip. You'll fucking hit your head on the stairs. I don't care, I'll fall on him. ( chuckling ) Is this shit funny? Yes. Here we go. One Arab coming up. Over here? Right over here. He's fucking going down. All right, go get the duct tape. Yeah, I know where it is. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you crazy? What the fuck are you guys doing? Flip you over. No, no! I got it. Get his fucking hand. I got his legs. I got him. You just hold his legs while I get this. ERIC: Help! Fucking help! What the fuck! Ow, ow, okay! Help me! Help! Shut the fuck up! Let's gag him. You got his legs? I don't want there to be circulation. ERIC: No! No! No! ( loud screaming ) Sounds so much better. Shut up! ( muffled screaming ) Shut up! Huh? Ssh! Ssh! You see that shit? Look at that. You know what that shit means? That means freedom. ( muffled ) What? Huh? How you feeling? How you feeling? Yo, Bo, get him up on his knees. Get him on his knees, I want this. I fucking want this so bad. ( muffled screaming ) Look at me! Don't look at him. You want a beer, you piece of shit? Where's Allah to save his ass now, Mike? Wouldn't give us a beer, here's one. This right here, is for all our people this motherfucker killed. Oh, fuck! Yeah, you like that? We're actually doing it! Fucking doing it. ( Eric coughing ) Hey, Eric, Eric? ( screaming ) Hey, I'm not going to shoot you. I'm not going to shoot you. It's okay, listen to me. What's he doing, huh? BRANDON: You look so fucking scared. Right now, you need to come to terms with the fact that we're going to torture you. Just like your people do to Americans. Kyle, go get the camera! All right. Take that fucking shotgun. He's screamed enough. Hold on. Hold on. It's going to be fine. You didn't do... He's good, he's good. Put that in his face. What? There? Huh? We're not gonna shoot you. We're not gonna shoot you. Hey, what's that feel like? Hey, Brandon, Brandon? You want me to shoot you in the balls, huh? Hey, Brandon, man, you seen my smokes? Your smokes? Did you leave them in the car? Yeah, I think I did, man. I'm gonna go get them. Okay. All right, yeah. What? You'll do anything? What will you do? Shut up. So you found them? Oh, fuck! Yeah. Found them. I know you always got my back, right, Mike? Yeah. You ain't gonna fuck me? No. Grab your smokes, let's get back in there. All right, all right. BRANDON: It's fucking cold. Yeah. These motherfuckers, they want us to live in fear. They want us looking over our shoulders... scared to leave our fucking country, but fuck that. We're Americans, we don't get scared. We don't look like that. No, man, because we're the toughest country in the entire world. No stupid monkey Arab is gonna tell me what to do. Brandon, he hasn't moved for 30 minutes. Can you take it easy on him? You don't have to yell. Yeah, he's sleeping. Hey! Fall down on the ground before I kill you! There he goes! ( laughing ) If this kid came after you, especially you... what do you think he'd fucking do to you? He'd feed you oil. He'd fucking cut your dick off. ERIC: No! Yeah, man, they'd kill you, bro. They'd torture your ass first. Shut up. They'd steal your dreidel and shit it out. Yeah, they'd steal all your dreidels. All right, after all this, after fucking 9/11... you don't want to kill those cocksuckers? Of course, I do. I would kill all of them if I could. Well, here you go. Here's your chance, Mike. All right. Will he kill him? Will he kill him? Hey, you want to wipe my people off the map? No! Huh? Is that true? No! Is that true? You want to kill my people? Huh? Don't look at me! Don't look at me! Tss, I'm just playing. Hey, man, he hasn't done anything to us. Dude, they're the fucking same. He's just waiting for his chance. We need to send these fuckers a message, is what we need to do. Hell, yeah, man. That's exactly what we need to do, Bo. We need to send them a message. And I know exactly how we're gonna do it. We're gonna cut his head off. What? And then we're gonna take his filthy little head... and we're gonna put it right up to the fucking camera. So every goddamn Arab knows what the deal is. Yeah, hell yeah. Right here in front of the flag. It's gonna be payback for 9/11. See I know he didn't do it. But you're telling me he wasn't happy about it? They all were. Stay down, motherfucker! Stay down! Look at him. He's not one of us. He's praying to Allah right now. No, I'm not. He wants to wipe your people off the map, Mike. Yeah. Seriously. They're supposed to kill anyone who's not Arab. That's what they teach their children. That's what they instill in the future. We need to stop that. That's not true! Yeah, well, they'll know it was us. We'll cover our faces with a rag or some shit. Say the National Anthem. Just fucking put my hood on or some shit. No, screw that, the Pledge of Allegiance. Fuck, yeah! The Pledge of Allegiance. And then we're gonna cut his head off like they do over in Iraq. And then we'll hit the roof, grab a few beers. Grab a few beers. Let the cops find him. Check this out. Got anything good? Yeah, yeah. Hold on. Badass, bro, when you were up in the camera. ( vehicle approaching ) Yo, someone's here. ( muffled ) Help! That's the fucking cops, man! Shut the fuck up! I'll snap your fucking neck. Put him in the fucking... Ssh, ssh. ( Bo whispering ) Shut the fuck up. ( door creaking ) Back the fuck up! ( speaking Spanish ) Oh, what the fuck? Why the fuck did you do that? The fuck was I supposed to do, bro? He was gonna call the fucking cops. You fucking asshole. Hey, what do we do now? Okay? Hey! Hey! What do we do now? We bury him. What? We dig a fucking hole and we put the body in it. We bury him out back. What? You can't just dig a fucking hole and put a body in it. Why not? Because fucking dogs will find it in two fucking seconds. Who gives a shit? This guy is a wetback fucking worker. He's not even supposed to be here. It's fine. So that's why you killed him? I killed him because he was gonna bust us. I don't give a shit, because he ain't supposed to be here! Brandon, man, what the fuck? What the fuck? What's the difference now? We gotta take care of this. We gotta do something about it. We? No. Yeah, motherfucker! We! Oh, what? What? Hey! Bo! Bo! No! Bo, you take Kyle, go out back, dig a hole. Okay? We'll carry the body. No, man, no fuck that. I don't want to have any fucking thing to do with this! Yeah, well, none of us do! Who's gun is that? Huh? We gotta take care of this. No, no. I ain't gotta do shit! Okay? Because you guys lost your fucking, fucking, minds! All right? You know, scaring that kid is one thing, all right? But you lost your fucking mind. You fucking killed someone! I know that! What the fuck are we supposed to do about it? Huh? You gotta better idea? Yeah, yeah! Here's my fucking idea! Don't fucking kill someone, you fucking fuck! What have we learned from that idea? What are you going to do, fucking shoot me? What have we learned from that idea? I'm fine, Mike. I'm fine. I'm sorry, Mike. Why don't you shoot all of us? Listen to me, okay? No. We gotta hide it, okay? And you gotta help. Mike, Brandon fucking killed someone. What? Then what? Then we'll let him go... and we'll go to Cali or something, or Mexico, okay? I don't know, but we'll get out of here. We just gotta take care of this first. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'll help. Okay, take Kyle, go downstairs and go get shovels. Okay. Yo, Kyle. Kyle, come on, get up, man. Come on, man, get up. Come help me. Come help me. Come walk it off. Come on. I'm sorry, Mike. You're fine, Kyle. You okay? You're good, man. You're good. BO: There's a shovel over there. You're okay. You're good. You're good. You're good, Kyle. Come on. What the fuck? I'm gonna dig a fucking grave. Come on. You with me? Let's dig. Kyle, you and I are getting out of here, okay? Just as soon as we get a clean shot. We'll fucking run. No, man, I don't know, man. Mike said we're just gonna let the kid go. Shut up! Fuck, Mike! Okay? They're not gonna let that kid go. So, listen. Soon as we get a clean shot, I want you to fucking run, okay? You and I, we're gonna fucking run that way... and I want you to run as fast as you possibly fucking can, okay? Until you can't run anymore. Okay? You got me? Yeah. Okay. I got you, man. ( ominous music fades up ) Fucking Christ. ( muttering continues ) Fuck, I almost broke the shovel. Just keep digging. He's coming out. He's coming out. Just be cool. Hey, what's happening? Man, I'm sorry, I just lost my shit in there before, okay? You found a shovel. Yup. Well, keep digging. Thanks. Sure. I hate Arabs more than I hate Mexicans. You cool, Mike? Yeah. I'm cool. You sure about that? Yeah. Yo. Ready? Doesn't look like you've done anything, bro. Yeah, I mean, we've been digging a lot. Make it big, I want to go deeper. We're putting a fucking body in there. Right, got it. Fucking, stupid spic body. Right? Right. Fucking motherfucker had it coming, you know what I'm saying? Let me know when you're done. We'll bring him out, all right? Yeah, I'll come get you. Fucking tired of digging graves. Hey, bro. What you think's gonna happen to that kid, man? What? I can't fucking here you. What? Do you think they're really gonna cut his head off? I don't know. It's just... I don't fucking know, man. I mean, he said he wasn't even Arab, dude. Ssh, shut up! You remember in the car, man? He said he wasn't even Arab, man. Yo, fucking run. Fucking run, Kyle. ( music fades up ) BRANDON: Well, shit's a bit different now, isn't it? You think your boys show my people any mercy? I don't. I think they like watching them squirm. Where are those two idiots at? You know? Aren't they digging out back? Yeah, but they should be done. Why don't you go check up on them, huh? MIKE: All right. When I get over there... I'm gonna go into each house... one by one, and kill every last one of you. You don't deserve to live. You got something to say? Let me hear it. Please, please. I didn't do anything. Your cousins did. No, I'm Indian. It's the same shit. No, I'm not an Arab. Tomayto, tomahto. What are you saying? I'm saying you're the same fucking piece of shit. What? They're gone. Those fuckheads! Fuck! That's fucking... You just gotta take my back. Stay for a minute. If you even fucking breathe too loud, I will kill you. Come on, Mike, let's do this. BRANDON: Come on, Mike! Come on, we gotta fucking drag him out back. What are we doing? Well, we're picking him up and we're taking him in the back, come on. Wait, wait, please, I don't want to touch him. You need to touch him to bring him out back. Grab his legs, I'll take the fucking head. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Aw, fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck. His fucking leg. Mike, grab a fucking shovel! Just fucking bury him. Not that hard. It's not that hard. It's almost done, Mike. Oh, fuck, man, he's moving a little bit. Dude, he's not fucking moving. He's fucking moving, dude. He's dead. Fuck! Oh, god! Mike, get it together. Fucking put some... Where do you... Where do you think they went? I don't fucking know. Don't think about that shit. Do you think we should go? What the fuck did you just say? I mean, I was just... You know... You're sure about this? Right? Yeah, I'm sure about this. We're always talking about how we gotta do something about these fucking terrorists. Well, that's what we're doing. We're being Americans... defending our country. You said it yourself, you'd kill them all. No, man, I know, I didn't say that. I didn't mean it, man. Why? 'Cause that's different. Why is it different? 'Cause those guys are evil. They're killing innocent people. It's not war! It's terrorism! That's the same. Right now we're in a war against terrorism. Those motherfuckers are against us! That motherfucker in there is one of them! That motherfucker in there is Eric Singh! My brother is fighting a war over there. This is how we fight it here. Fuck your brother, man! What the fuck did you just say to me? Fuck you! Listen to me! You're just making excuses, because you're scared! Stop being a pussy! Fuck! Can't believe I'm gettin' shit from you. Of all fucking people. ( steps approaching ) Where you going? Please, please, I'll do whatever you want. Get the camera. I want it facing the flag. Huh? Okay. Put this on your face. Put this on. All right, you're gonna hit Record... and then we're gonna come over and say the Pledge of Allegiance, you got that? Yeah. All right, let's do this. No! No! No, stop! Get on your knees. Stop! Stop! That hurt? That hurt? Good. Please. Is that set up? Hit Record, come on, get over here. ( yelling ) No, please! Help! Help! I pledge of allegiance to the flag... of the United States of America. Please! And to the republic for which it stands... Don't do this! One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. This is for you terrorist motherfuckers! And everybody you killed in 9/11! No, please! Our brothers over in Iraq and in the name of our god... the real god, this is our revenge! No! And it's not gonna end until you stop killing my people! God bless my country, America. Go, get the fucking camera. No! No! Get the fuck down, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! ( gurgling blood ) BRANDON: Mike, what are you fucking doing? Goddamn it! Die, motherfucker! Why don't you fucking die? Shit! ( gun cocks ) Mike, why are you doing that, Mike? ( shotgun blast ) ( shell clinks ) ( heavy breathing ) ( whimpering ) ( sobbing ) Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god! ( weeping ) ( gun cocks ) MIKE: Sorry, Mom. ( weeping ) ( shotgun blast ) ( shell clinks ) Good evening, and thank you for joining us. We're on location to bring you this special report. The duration of our program will focus on an event... that many believe was as disturbing as the shootings... at Columbine High School in Colorado five years ago. Last week, police made a gruesome discovery... the bodies of three teenagers were found... in this small and normally quiet town. Two are said to have died of severe gunshot wounds... while the third died of a deep laceration on his neck. It is believed that an attempt was made to decapitate him. Another body, said to be a farm worker's... was found buried in the back. Local officers were informed of the bodies... by two teenagers who said they were present... just before the murders took place. They are 17 year old Kyle Castranovo... and 18 year old Boris Aznabev. Those two young men are to be tried as adults. They are being charged with a myriad of crimes... including kidnapping, murder... and violation of civil rights under federal law. The debate of how and how much the media... influences our children is now more relevant than ever. Perhaps this incident, better than any other... shows us how 9/11 and this new war on terrorism... is affecting today's youth. More on this when we return. ( music fades up )
