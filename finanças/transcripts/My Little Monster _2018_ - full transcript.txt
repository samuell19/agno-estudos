"Radio Broadcast" is how things are so I'm surprised... We're requesting ideas for new segments, so please check it out. And now our first song this week, a hit from 2010, Kana Nishino's "Best Friend". "Thank you for being in my life" "whatever time" "always smile with me" "Time can never separate us" Back then, all I cared about was studying. "everything remains unchanged" I didn't want friendship or love. "We are the best friend..." I spent my days with English vocabularies, maths formulas, and history. But before long, I had many friends surrounding me. Always in the middle was that monster... Haru Yoshida. What are you doing? In our first year in high school, Haru, who sat next to me, had gotten into a fight on the first day of school and hadn't shown up since. And all these papers for Yoshida, who hasn't come to school at all... Mizutani, could you... Mizutani? These are for Yoshida. Could you deliver them to him, please? So it's already been a month since school started... "School Guide" Excuse me... My name is Shizuku Mizutani. Where's Yoshida? Haru? I was told to deliver these. Bye. Did the school send you? Huh? Is that teacher begging me to come to school? I just delivered some papers. Papers? Hey. You mean... like in grade school when a friend delivers papers when you're absent? What's your name? Shizuku Mizutani. Oh, Shizuku. You can call me Haru, since we're friends. See you, Shizuku! This was how "my little monster" and I, Shizuku Mizutani, met each other. My Little Monster Don't move. Come on. Aren't we like friends hanging out on the way home from school? Haru. Hi. - Lend us money. - What? Again? Come on. We're friends, right? Oh, all right. How much you got? Give us all you have. - Thanks. - See you. Thanks a lot. Yoshida. Go to school if you really want friends. No way! Everyone seems to be scared of me. Everyone shuns me. So no more school. But you're the first one who came to my place. And they're the first ones who weren't scared of me. So I don't need school... You're the only one who thinks so. Real friends wouldn't sponge off you. I have no friends so I can't be sure, but I'd rather have no friends than have ones like them. You're nasty. Wow. You're amazing, Mizutani Doing that to Yoshida of all people. By the way... who are you? At least learn the faces of your classmates. I'm Sasahara. Call me Sasayan. What do you want? Well, I'm kind of indebted to Yoshida. We went to the same junior high. I played baseball. A kid was being bullied. Aren't you helping him? I couldn't help. But Yoshida... He knocked out the bullies to help, got in trouble, and never came back to school. So I'm hoping it'll work out this time. I hope so, too. Mizutani, could I ask you a favor again? Mizutani... He'll be expelled if he doesn't come Bye. Hey. Want to try? I couldn't do it. But Yoshida... Oh... Give us money! That's what happened then, too. I pretended not to notice... What do you want? Haru must have been trying to help. Haru is such a wet blanket. He won't pay us these days. There's no point anymore, then. He was the perfect wallet. You're right. What a drag. Let's play pool. Let's do nine-ball. OK, let's do nine-ball. Then the loser buys ramen today. I don't have money. Do you think Haru really considers us his friends? Of course. That happy look on his face. I feel a bit sorry for him. It makes him happy so it's OK. We're doing him a favor. Hey, you were with Haru the other day. Yoshida... Huh? He thinks of you as his friends. So... please treat him with more respect. What the... Ow! Ow! You all... should leave now. Haru! Haru, we're sorry! Put me down! Help me! Gosh, it's not worth crying over. You wanted them to be friends that much? No. I feel happy. You'll be OK. Someday, lots of people... will surround you. I guess... I'd be willing to go to school if you're there. My heart's racing. I think I like you, Shizuku. Do you mean... - as friends? - No. In a sexual way. Shizuku. Shizuku. Oh, Yoshida! I'm so glad you came! I don't like you. Go away! Haru. I'm surprised you really came. Of course I did. And so the seat next to mine finally became occupied, but... Hey. Hey, where are you going, Shizuku? Shizuku. Shizuku! Shizuku! Shizuku! Hey! What are you doing, Shizuku? Shizuku! Cleaning? I'll do it, too! - Give me that. - It's OK. - Don't be shy! - It's OK! - Give it! - It's OK! Oh, Shizuku! Shizuku... Take me here. - No. - Why not? Studying is more important. Don't friends go places after school? I'm busy. I want to go with you! Nobody else will come with me. Listen! Midterm exams are coming up. I have to be No. 1! Mizutani. Please tutor me. Shizuku! I wanna eat monja pancakes with you! - Monja! Monja! - Please wait! My name is Asako Natsume. Uh, by the way, Yoshida is glaring at me. Don't mind him. He's so sensitive. It seems that I'm barely good enough for this school. I'm slated for remedial class if I fail. But I really have to go somewhere that day. So could you... No, I won't. So rejective. Sorry but it's not my concern. Hey, look. As you can see, I'm pretty. So guys fall all over me, and girls hate me for it. But take a look at this. Online I'm known as "Golbez" and always surrounded by friends. I don't even know their faces, but they're the first friends I've ever made. "Female friends wanted!" "High School Friends Club" So I really want to go to the meet-up I'll tutor you. What? Really? But take me to this meet-up in exchange. Sure, OK! Oh, but don't become attracted to me. It's annoying. OK, don't worry! Ridiculous. Studying is more important than friends. I've always liked being No. 1. Because all my effort pays off. Because I can sincerely feel that my choice is not mistaken What, do you want the electronic dictionary? Mizutani. Do you want it? What? Come get it. Rich brat. "Midterm Exams Result" Excuse me. Please let me through. The best marks I've ever made! "No. 2: Shizuku Mizutani" You're No. 2, Mitty! I'm so impressed! You don't mind if I call you Mitty, do you? "No. 1: Haru Yoshida" So you were the one who aced the entrance exams. Sorry but you're my enemy until the finals. Hey, get back here! Haru, what the... It was wandering around in the rain this morning. Poor thing. Don't you think so? Let's all look after it. Come on, Shizuku. And so we're establishing this new committee... Mitty. We're kicking off the Chicken Committee. Haru, Sasayan, listen up. Haru's cousin. - Micchan. - Micchan, don't feed him. OK. We have the school's permission, so the issue is how to make the coop "Chicken coop plan" Why don't we all build it together? Then shall we go to the store? Spending a day off with classmates... We'll all go! OK, Shizuku? You're part of "all". OK, Shizuku? Got it? OK, Shizuku? Hey, stop that. Got it? Haru. We don't need these. Excuse me! Oh, Mizutani. You're that chick... Frumpy clothes. Hey, you! What do you want? Whoa, whoa, calm down, Haru. Yamaken. They say they want to apologize to you. So you wanted to make up. - Why didn't you just say so? - Ow! You know Haru? We went to the same schools until grade school. Whenever Haru was bullied, his brother would come and retaliate in a terrible way. Brother? Haru has a brother? You're not his girlfriend? No, I... want to study. You say that, but you seem to be enjoying yourself. What? "Nagoya" Cool! We did a great job! It's not cute. OK, Nagoya's going in! Oh, there he is! Go! - Go, go! - Good! Go, go! Nagoya! Nagoya! What's wrong, Nagoya? Go, go! Nagoya! Go! Go, go! Yay! Wow, he went in by himself! This is fine, Haru. Don't be shy. I still want to be with you. "From Micchan: Yuzan is here" Yuzan. I'll go now, then. I'm not going home today. Aw...I bought these for him. Mitsuyoshi, give me coffee. I didn't want to come, you know. How much longer does he intend to avoid us? Hey, dude. Mind if I change channels? Um...Shizuku. You changed it! Who is he? He doesn't want to go home. What's going on? Hey, Shizuku! There's a child ghost in here! Hey! Look! Got him! He's my brother! Takaya. What? Your brother? Nice to meet you. I'm Takaya Mizutani. The way you're so aloof is just like Shizuku! Isn't he a good boy? He's a bit shy. You made all this? Pickles, too. You're amazing! Yum! Dude, give me tea. Oh, OK. You're so free spirited. Hey, where's your mom? - She's working. - Huh? We get by because my wife works. I failed in business a few times. - Six times. - Six? You're such a sorry dad! Yes, I suppose I am. My wife is working away from home right now, so Shizuku and Takaya probably miss her a lot. Wow, Shizuku! You study at home, too? You've been making an effort too. Taking classes seriously. Well, I don't get it, but studying is important to you, right? So if it's important to you, I'll take it seriously. But why do you study all the time? Goldfish. Huh? My mom and I made a promise long ago, that we'd all go see fireworks and scoop goldfish. But she had to work. I'd been looking forward to it. Shizuku. I could still take you. No, it's OK. I didn't want to be letdown anymore. "Math Workbook" And studying never let me down. So... I decided to study. I feel fulfilled when I study. Because my effort pays off. I've never told anybody about this. Why was I able to tell Haru? It's OK, Haru. You can stay here. Stay as long as you want. I'll cast a spell on you. Haru. Where were you last night? Yuzan wants to see you. They didn't even come to Aunt Kyoko's funeral. Who cares what they want? The ball! The ball! Over here! Yoshida, shoot! Huh? Wow, Yoshida, what a shot, but our side is that way! We go that way. That was amazing! Oh. Here. Thanks. - Yoshida, watch it! - Coming through! Coming through! 3 months passed since I met Haru. "School girls, skaters, white collars, mothers" "office ladies, come and join us" "in different generations" "I don't care, boys and girls" Hey, Shizuku. Look. "What really matter" "is inside but not outlook" "even so quiet you are" Here you go. Oh, it's the same! Her clothes are the same as yours! "Everybody love and joy feel the love and joy" "Let's be free" "Everybody love and joy feel the love and joy" I can't see. "become what you are" "Wow, feel the love and joy" "You are you" "from Tokyo to Osaka" "fly through the unpredictable ocean and say hello" Hey, watch out! Watch out! "To New York City, Taiwan" Here it comes! "To Hong Kong, London, all the world" Huh? "Compared to money, compared to love" "This moment is the most important" "the fair lady" "you, the one with dream" "Everybody love and joy feel the love and joy" "Let's be free" "Everybody..." Ow! "Love and joy feel the love and joy" "Wow, become what you are" "Oh, feel the love and joy" Natsume. "Wow, run out together immediately" You OK? "Oh, feel the love and joy" Yes. "Wow, you are you" Are you Shizuku Mizutani? What? I knew it. You're just like Mitsuyoshi said. I heard Haru is going to school now thanks to you. Um... I'm Yuzan. Thanks for hanging out with my brother. You know that Haru is living with our cousin Mitsuyoshi? Yes. Our father is...How can I put it? A strict person. Haru was kicked out before entering junior high. He was a problematic kid in many ways. But after hearing that Haru is back in school, Father wants him back home again. What? Back home? You... What the hell, Yuzan? Get away from Shizuku! So I was right. I thought you'd show up if I did this. Long time no see. How are you? I don't know what you guys are thinking, but I'm not going home! Let's go, Shizuku. Wait, Haru. I'm not sure but maybe you should talk to Yuzan. Why do you avoid him? He came to see... Leave me alone! That's right. Why did I care about him? Being pushed around by others... Studying, moreover a secure future, are more important. Shizuku. Shizuku, look. Shizuku. Whatever holds me back would be dismissed. That's my way. Class president, do these, will you? Do these, too. OK. Are you... the class president? Uh, yes. You're awesome! Class presidents are coveted positions that only popular people can get. No, I was only... left with the responsibility just because I wear glasses. Glasses, huh? I see. So that's what I lacked. You're nice. I'm Oshima. Oshima, you're nice. Are you jealous by any chance? Welcome to Shoyo Festival! Come one, come all! It's that time of year again! The 12th annual Shoyo Festival! Our slogan this year is... For One Purpose! Don't scare me! Don't scare me! Keep going! What's this? - You wimps! - Stop that! You're here, too? Let's go. See you! Shizuku. All out of fake blood. It's going over well, Haru. Your "Bloody Baron" Mitty, I've noticed you're being cold to Haru lately. Not really. I just... felt a bit stupid for letting him push me around. Ooh, girls' talk? Oh, come on. You're special in Haru's eyes. He's always thinking about you and it's obvious you're his "best of only one". He stays with me because he doesn't want to be alone. I'm just convenient to be around. Nobody wants to be alone, you know. And it's natural to think that the person who is closest to you is special. How do you feel about him? It's none of your business. Excuse me. Is the odd girl lying there Natsume, by any chance? I had a falling-out with Mitty. Things are over for Asako Natsume. Over? Why? When girls clash even once, it's all over between them. It's not over. If you're really friends then you open up to each other and fight and start from there. Hi. What are you doing? Man, your school is just way too big. It's no bigger than average. Don't tell me you're lost. How's it going lately with Haru? I don't know. I haven't spoken to him much. Why? Being around Haru is suffocating. I can't focus on my studies. So I don't want to see him. Hey, want to know why you can't get rid of him? You expect things from him. You expect things from him, but refuse to meet his expectations. How cruel, Mizutani. And yet you feel lonely now. I don't. I've always been alone but never felt lonely. Idiot. You only feel lonely when you miss somebody. I see. You're amazing, Yamaken. When I'm with you, I can think clearly. Here's your change. Yoshida, do you like Mizutani? Yeah, I like her. Though she's cold to me lately. Does that mean... you like her as a girl? I'm sorry. For saying it's none of your business. I'm your friend. And Haru's, too. It is my business. You're right. Stop throwing firecrackers! Stop doing that just because you don't have partners! I can't believe it. Haru is enjoying ordinary high school life. Yamaken. Do you like Shizuku? Got a problem with that? It's OK, Haru. You can stay here I'll cast a spell on you. So that you can be with someone and feel their warmth. You'll become... a very fortunate person when that happens. Hurry up before she leaves. Stop it. Tell her. Natsume, he wants to tell you something. No, I don't... Don't be shy. It's off-putting. He wants to be your boyfriend. Don't! You're in a bad mood, Natsume. I don't like boys. Hey, I love girls. Falling in love is nice. It changes you for better or worse. A good love life can make you mature, if you know what I mean. Then could I become more mature with you? What? Nothing. You confessed? Yes. But he just brushed it off. You like Micchan? I'm probably... in love with him. I know it's ridiculous for me to feel this way. Even my best friend back in junior high ended up hating me. I always used to think, "Why am I always alone?". I know it's ridiculous. I know it. I know it. Natsume. The past is in the past. Nothing is holding you back now. Micchan said that... a good love life can make people mature. If I could become more mature, then I want to be with someone, too. I was always afraid. Hard work doesn't always pay off. You can't control people's feelings. And it hurts. Will I be able to bear that pain? Shizuku's birthday? Yeah. February 14th. I wish we could celebrate it, but she's spending the day with her family. Shizuku is making... her own birthday cake. "Happy Birthday, Shizuku" Welcome. Thank you for coming to Soleil Mall today. Today is February 14th, St. Valentine's Day. Do you have your chocolates ready? Oh, so it is you, Oshima. I saw you moving for a moment up here. Wow, you have great vision. Yeah. Um, sorry to call you out today so suddenly. I wanted to give you... Don't worry about it. I wanted to talk to you, too. About Shizuku's birthday present. I have no idea what to get her at all. Any good advice? Get something that would make her happy. Imagine the happy look on her face when you give it to her. I know! Just came up with something! I'll go buy it! Hey, what did you want to say? Nothing. Good luck. Yeah. Shizuku is decorating... her own birthday party. Natsume. I'd like to ask you... to forget about me. I appreciate your thoughts, but... I don't want to. You told me that a good love life can complete us. You're always so nice to me... I'm only nice to you because I don't intend to face you. I'm serious. I really love you. Is it the age difference? Then in a few years I'll come of age... There's no place for you in my heart, Natsume. I'd really rather not... say any more than that. She ended up working again. I'm impressed that you made so many dishes your mother likes. Tomorrow I'll make dishes that Takaya likes. Here. These are from Dad and me. Thanks. Oh. I have something for you two... What are you doing? I brought a present. Damn it! I was going to leave it in your room but you caught me. Happy birthday, Shizuku. Open it. I never thought you'd... get me something so practical. Micchan's mom had the same one and I thought it'd be perfect for you. Thanks. I'll treasure it. Yeah. Excuse me... Sorry to interrupt, but what about the party? Dude, is it OK for me to be here? You were already sitting there before I gave you permission. Where's your mom? The most sensitive topic of the day... She's not here on your birthday? Yeah, she has to work. So I'm glad you came. We had a portion leftover. Shizuku. Here. "Happy Birthday, Shizuku" Now then, once again... Happy birthday! That was fun! Wish I could have met your mom. Oh. Why don't you give her a call? No, there's no particular reason... You have a reason. It's your birthday. The person you wanted to see most wasn't me. It was your mom, right? Here, call her. I'll be right here. Hello? Mom? The phone? It's my friend's. Today... is my birthday, so... I wanted to talk. OK. See you. What did she say? She said she'd call back in an hour, so we'll talk then. That's great, Shizuku! See you. Good night. Yeah, good night. Haru. I like you. Huh? I like you. Do you understand? I understand. All right, then. Hello? Mom? Guess what? I... I really like someone. Until recently, I used to be self-absorbed. But the person who changed that... Shizuku. ...was Haru. - Good morning. - Good morning. "In the sunflower," "we two shoulder by shoulder" "hand by hand, we smile" "There is..." Oshima! "Nothing really matter" "with you, everything is special" We're in the same class again! "Too close will lead to forgetfulness" Mitty? "Unintentionally" "All my inconsiderable acts" "you embrace them gently" "So let me stay still, so let the time pause" "hope that we can find each other" Shizuku, give me your arm. "This scenario, no matter centuries pass" Shizuku. "hope that it will never change" Let's go, Shizuku. You're too fast! "In heart it will never change" "so let me pause the time" "Hope that we can find each other" Is this the right way to do this? "This scenario," Probably. "no matter centuries pass" OK, gather round. Here we go. Three, two, one. "Hope that..." OK, Micchan? Yeah, perfect. "it will never change" Oh, Mizutani. How unusual. What brings you here? I wanted to borrow a geography book. Oh. By the way, Yoshida, I heard that you aren't going to college. Your homeroom teacher seemed really upset just now. What do you plan on doing instead of college? Deep-sea tuna fishing. Deep-sea tuna fishing? Yes. He says he's leaving after graduation. He doesn't want to burden you. It's so like him to say that. Haru is brilliant. He's much smarter than I am. Does his family know about this? His family is complicated. He lived with his father after his parents divorced, but things happened and he left home. He hasn't contacted his family since. Haru... never told me anything. You again. I need to ask you a favor. We're celebrating my birthday on Sunday, and I'd like to ask you to come. Not on your life. Dad wants you there. Who cares? Please. It's an important day for me. I beg you. Why not go, Haru? It's a birthday party, right? You're invited, too. We'll have lots of good food. This will be the last time. Don't barge into my life anymore. I owe you one. Should I be going? Your family will get together for the first time in a while. My only family was Yuzan. But Yuzan gradually stopped smiling, and I no longer belonged there. So I'm not going back. Sending a car over... Yuzan doesn't trust me at all. I intend to name... Haru as my successor. What? Haru? Very well. So be it. Sorry it tooks so long. The people here helped me... But why all the fuss? It's a birthday party, right? I thank you all. "Taizo Yoshida Supporters Association" "Taizo Yoshida Supporters Association" Haru. I've seen your father before. In the political news. You're imagining it. We are delighted to see so many of you here. Being able to celebrate this day together with all of you is primarily due to your support and cooperation. My heartfelt thanks... Haru, it's been so long! You never showed up. I don't want to go to Alaska. Alabama. The Gulf of Mexico. I'm sure you'd take interest Your aunt would have wanted you to. Mr. Haru Yoshida? Please give a speech later on. Thank you. Your father... Hello, nice to meet you. It was nice meeting you. Wow, so it's you, Shizuku. Here. It's a memo pad. I'd expected a normal birthday party. Happy birthday. Oh yeah, so it was my birthday party. I'd forgotten. Thanks for bringing Haru here. Your father has been very supportive... Haru. Welcome home. My father is grateful. He's relieved that Haru is behaving normally. He's seriously considering taking Haru back, and making him his successor if possible. Not me. Haru is saying he won't go home. He won't go to college. He says he'll work as a fisherman. He doesn't understand his worth at all. He has so many choices. I promised him long ago. It'll be OK, Haru. I'll make sure you belong. But our father was only interested... Next. in Haru's extraordinary intelligence. Next. Next. And on that day... You're so lucky, Haru. You've probably never imagined how I always feel. I wish you weren't here. I chased him out. Now allow me to introduce you to my other boy, my second son, Haru Yoshida. It's so ironic. Haru was the one who helped me belong in that house. So this time it's my turn to support him. When he said he wasn't going to college, there was a part of me that couldn't forgive him. At that moment, I envied him. And I intend to educate Haru as my eventual political heir... Don't be ridiculous. Hey, Haru! Let's go, Shizuku! Is everything all right? It's all right. My apologies. Man, what a farce. Let's get out of here. I'm starving. Let's eat takoyaki. Shizuku? You should go back. Huh? Stop running away and making Yuzan do all the work. Think of your future. Let's just grab some takoyaki. I thought we were the same. I thought you and I were the same. How so? That we both lacked something we wanted. But you... Everything is within your reach if only you were willing. You could have anything. But you're running away from it all. You too, now? You wouldn't understand! Then do you understand how I feel? If only you weren't here... then I wouldn't feel this way. I thought you would understand. You, and Yuzan and this party... can all go to hell! Hey, where's Haru? Witnessing a party like that... is shocking. I don't know why... Why did I say that to him? I don't know how I feel anymore. You know what? I think you'd be better off being with me. You two aren't really in a romantic relationship. It's a game of make-believe friendship. Maybe you're right. At least I wouldn't make you feel worried or confused. Listen, Mizutani. People's feelings change. But not ours. Surely we've built something up together. I decided to apologize to Haru when I saw him the next day. I'll apologize and talk to him. It'll be OK. He'll understand and smile like he always does. It'll be OK. We can go back to normal. But then... I found out that "normal" is easily destroyed. "Even if I am not here, you are fine" "from the day you know the truth, to now" "your catchphrase, your smile" "In here nothing will disappear" "no matter what, I will remember" "There is no solution if it is like that" "Where are you, what are you thinking" "Missing: Haru Yoshida" "Even now I am here" Thanks. "somehow we will meet with smile..." No problem. "until that time" "you tenderness will not be forgotten" "The memory will be transferred with belief" "I'm wishing, still hoping" Move to the left. Smile. Thanks. Yum. "This way for university admission exams" Please begin. "Acceptance Letter" Congratulations. Thanks. Admission exams are over! Cheers! Cheers! What's this all about? It was given to me. We were able to spend quality time in this way because of the invaluable friendships we found along the way. Today, on this joyous occasion, we will be leaving this school where we laughed and cried together, but we pledge that we will take the memories with us as we take our next step forward. Representing the graduating class, Shizuku Mizutani. I don't want to graduate, Mitty. Let's repeat a year. No way! - I'll miss you! - Let's take a picture together. Let's take a picture over there. Sounds good. Stand closer. Huddle together. Say cheese. Yay! OK. My diploma! A dream come true. I'm surprised you graduated. Mizutani. Mizutani. Sorry, Mizutani, but these... belong to Yoshida. Take them, will you? "Yoshida's personal belongings" Shizuku. "School Guide" Like in grade school when a friend delivers papers to who was absent? You're the first one who came to my place, you can call me Haru, since we're friends. Don't friends go places after school? I want to go with you! Hey, Shizuku. Look. Haru. I came to see you. Honestly... I just wanted to tease Haru at first. You're not my type. I mean, why would I... But... You're true to yourself. You're honest. You always say what you think. After getting to know you, I should have just said this from the start. I love you. I... always felt your support. When I'm with you, I can be myself. But being with Haru... was truly exhausting. I felt angry and surprised... Things exceeded my expectations. But it was fun. Even now, when I think of him... it's still always fun. I'm sorry, Yamaken. Did you hear what I said? You better not regret it. You'll never meet another guy as awesome as me. These are Haru's. Sorry. They must have been heavy. I would have gone if you'd called. No, it's OK. It was kind of like old times. See you. Hey. Since you're here, want to try for the last time? We were able to spend quality time in this way because of the invaluable friendships we found along the way. Today, on this joyous occasion, we will be leaving this school where we laughed and cried together, but we pledge that... "Home Run" "Broadcast" Congratulations! Get your prize at the reception! Oh, a homer. Here, they're for you, Shizuku. You're still... as abrupt and bizarre as ever. When you suddenly show up like this, I get too happy to react. "Everyone keeps leaving me away" "Damn it" "Then I'll leave away," I thought So I decided to go as far away as I could, to sea... To sea? Yeah, the Gulf of Mexico. And I did research on a boat all day long and it was quite fun. Then I began to think, "Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter" "if I don't go back anymore," and worked non-stop. I worked and got hungry, and found myself lying on the street one day. When I woke up, "Shizuku..." That was the first thing I said without thinking. "Shizuku". What you said to me around the time we first met... "Someday, lots of people" "will surround you" I recalled how much those words saved me. How much those words gave me hope. And that's why I'm here now. I used to try so hard to grasp many things. But now... I don't need anything else. I missed you! Welcome home, Haru. I'm home, Shizuku.

"...how good would it be if you have the same feeling" "I love you, when you take out your brave" "I love you, when you called me" "Thank you very much" "suddenly I think" We'll do it, Haru. What's that, Yamaken? Your present. 1,000 divorce papers. - Thanks. - I'm kidding. Soon after we met, I said, "I think I like you, Shizuku". Things have changed since then. Now I love you, Shizuku. Cheers! You're late, Yuzan. Here, for you. Thank you.
