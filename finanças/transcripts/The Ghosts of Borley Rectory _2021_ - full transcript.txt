So, how long do you have Borley for, Mr. Price? Six months. That should be sufficient time for me to conclude my investigations at put the mystery of Borley Rectory to bed. Now, much work to be done. The Glanvilles will be here in the morning and I want the rectory fully operational. So, no experiments tonight then? Well, of course, dear boy. From this moment on, the investigation commences. - Are we set? - Yes. We have everything set for the first night as you requested. - Trip devices? - Set. - Camera rigs? - Yes, everything. Hm, I chose wisely from all the candidates. I'm here to learn. Have you learned enough to get a good drink going? Here you go, a nice cup of tea. Oh, no. I meant a real drink. Notebook, pencil, lantern, watch. Yes, I have everything. I'm ready. Good. You're not changing for bed? Remember, the rectory can be very cunning. To be prepared is best. Oh, don't worry. She will be kind on your first night. Now, go to the washroom and remember, one hour in each room. Wake me at 4:00 a.m.. An hour in each room. Well, I'm not spending one second in this room. I'm sorry, Mr. Price. - Harry! - Sidney. Harry, this is my daughter, Helen, and my son, Roger. Well, a pleasure to meet you. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Price. I must say, father speaks of you often. Only good things I hope. Did you drive up in that Aston you have? No, no, we took the train up. The Aston has a broken gear box. We took a taxi from the station, but the old bugger made us walk the last half mile. Said this place is cursed. Yes, the locals do take a little while to get used to. Come on, Helen. Mr. Price, would you mind if I take a look around? No, of course not. But do stay inside the grounds. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. It would seem that it's in here that most of the energy in previous events have been focused. Any reasons do you think? I wish I could give you even an estimated guess, dear boy. This building's extraordinary. It practically drips with history. Indeed it does. Just like his nose. As you can see, my son is rather astute at this sort of thing. Indeed he is. Will you be going back to London? Yeah, sorry, old chap, I have to. But I thought I'd bring Helen and Roger up and settle 'em in and then I'll be off later. Might even have time to catch sight of the blasted ghost. I'll put them both to work. Well, I'm sure with Helen, Roger and Mark helping you, you'll soon find what you're looking for. Did somebody call my name? Ah, Mark. Ah, and you found my daughter as well. Jolly good. How long have you got? Sorry, old boy, I need to travel back tonight. You will look after Helen and Roger for me? You need to look after Roger a little more. He has a weak, you know. Don't worry, old chap, they're in safe hands. And they'll learn a lot under my tuition. Excellent. Well, I'm sorry our little luncheon wasn't more elegant, but this all we could put together for you at such short notice. Being here on previous occasions, we didn't have the time or the resources to make more adequate investigations. But now, we have the opportunity to expand our psychical research and discover the missing evidence that one needs to make the best conclusions. Well, I must admit as long as I remember, Borley has been the source of many a story. Indeed, and I think it's absolutely vital that we get to the bottom of it once and for all. A great many people have spoken about this place. Indeed, it is well documented. Many witnesses, many different incidents. Yes, Charles? After all these years, what do you hope to achieve from this? I mean, you yourself have conducted extensive paranormal experiments with nothing to show for it. Charles, there is so much more to be done. Sciences have progressed since Lionel and Marianne first brought this place to my attention. Yes, but after all these years, not one piece of credible evidence has been confirmed. Now, Charles, you know that statement to be untrue. We have many catalogued pieces of evidence. - Yeah but- - And we have new, exciting experiments to conduct. I can assure you, we will get to the bottom of his matter. And what new experiments? I for one am intrigued. Yes, do tell. It's true, I did previously invite you to investigate Borley Rectory some years ago, but I told you then, the rectory is not haunted. I disagree. I've owned land here and my family have for over 100 years, going back to the Bull family. And they tell tales of hauntings, apparitions, terrible sounds, screams in the night. They are merely tales. There's no substance to them at all. They be convincing. Myself and my wife have heard things, seen things, terrible things. My livestock will not lay near this end of the field. - They know- - Look, can we get back to the question in hand? Now, Mr. Price, what is different now? What can you do now that we couldn't do before? I have been given a six month tenancy. Well, this is an unprecedented opportunity to investigate. Mr. Glanville and I have created a plan, a rotor of investigations. Not one single minute will go undocumented in this period. One of my team will always be awake to record, interpret and analyse. In fact, three of my team are working in this building right now. There's so many more mysteries here to be discovered. With round the clock investigations, we can understand or attribute some of these strange paranormal happenings to the normal and not the abnormal. We have some new untested experiments that I myself will undertake. And nothing too dangerous I hope? Well, everything that planned has been previously tested in the laboratory, but well, now's the time to test these new methods on location, here at Borley. Nothing too dangerous, nothing too fantastical, I assure you. I reiterate, the rectory is not haunted and never has been. It is haunted and you know it, Lionel. What worries me is that we turn Borley Village into a playground for the paranormal. A tourist attraction. Yes, that just wouldn't do. Imagine it, London folk arriving for day trips. Picnicking in the garden. Yes, well, that would never happen. Everything we plan will be conducted by scientific minds. Nothing we discover will be released to the press. You said that last time, Mr. Price. I for one, don't want any day trippers on my land. This is a hamlet, it should stay that way. And it will. That is why Charles Sutton is the only person who will be allowed to report on what we discover. I trust his judgement to be balanced. I don't want a circus here either. It would interrupt with my investigations, hamper any scientific conclusions. I will of course keep these things secret. In the knowledge that I will have exclusive use of any discoveries. Why are you lying, Lionel? Marianne, I have said my piece. He's lying. About what, Mrs. Foyster? When he tells you that Borley is not haunted. We can discuss this matter at a more convenient time, Marianne. No, we can discuss this now. 'Tis why we're here, to unravel the truth. Mrs. Foyster, is there more to tell? Yet more happenings that you've kept close to your heart? There is so much more. We agreed not to disclose any of this, Marianne. No, you instructed me not to. Now that Mr. Price has explained his intentions, I feel now is the time to reveal everything that happened here. Everything. There is nothing to disclose. You're lying. Either you tell them or I will. This could be interesting. Ah, we love a scandal. What better than a paranormal one? This is not humour, Mr. Sutton. Is there something in this, Mr. Foyster. Very well. I have experienced many inexplicable events here. What have you experienced? Something so frightening, I've hidden it away for many years. I also instructed Marianne and our servants never to speak of anything they saw, heard or encountered here at Borley. I'm truly sorry for this. But I'm certain my friend, the Reverend Henning, will reassure me that it was what was needed to maintain any sanity if our lives. To accepted what happened to me, to Marianne, was a way to the asylum. To ignore it, a way to carry on. For once, my husband accepts his responsibilities. I respect him for listening to my pleas. Thank you, Lionel. I will reveal my story, my paranormal events to Mr. Price, but to him only. Well, this I welcome. Well, I believe that concludes our matter. I must, however, reveal something to this table. - Marianne. - Sit down, Mr. Price. The stories are true. I have seen her in the house and grounds on many occasion. Her entity is all consuming. She places visions in your mind. Terrible, evil images. I must warn you and your team, Mr. Price. She knows I am here and she is smiling. She's smiling because she has you all alone for six months in her playground. She is here. Where? She's been listening from the beginning. - Is she in this room? - She's behind you. Can you see her? I cannot see her. Where is she? Be brave. Well, Harry Price, here I am. Finally, you have me in your hands. Do you believe in ghosts, Mr. Foyster? I have always believed. So, why wait so long to embrace it? Because I am a man of God. My mission is solely the care of my parishioners. Mostly humble, God fearing folk. Their faith is what holds them together. I would undermine every funeral I minister if I gave credence to another form of afterlife. To tell them that their loved ones might still be amongst them even after death? Yes. I know that whatever is present inside these walls is a lost soul. There is a pattern to it. - They're in a loop. - Well, yes. So, you have seen many? I have. Mostly they are shadows, memories of what once was here. I agree. But there is one, she has no pattern. She decides when to show herself. This is the one I search for. Marianne has seen her many times. For me, it was just the once. But that one time was the most frightening thing I have ever seen before or since. And since that day, I have never seen her again. Until just now. Today? With all certainty, what I saw standing behind you was what I witnessed in 1925. Still searching for the truth, Mr. Price? Yes. Yes, I am. I am determined to know everything. And now, I must say thank you. You will return with the others in six months time? It will be an honour. Miss Estelle Roberts comes to us not for the many reasons I have continually requested. As I explained in our previous correspondences, I have no reason to be subjected to a series of Mr. Price's experiments only to confirm my own abilities. Our psychical research could only confirm her ability. To be a creature in your laboratory is something I least desire. Scrutinising so-called psychical powers is a key part of our work. We use factual science with true meanings being achieved. I for one, know of your very well, Miss Roberts. Royal Albert Hall, 1930. You managed to bring forth Arthur Conan Doyle's spirit. Ah, you were there. I was. Sadly, I could not attend, but my father was most impressed. Please, allow me a little time and my team could organise a test right now. Mr. Price, my reasons for being here have not changed in the least. I'm here for Borley Rectory. It has called to me. I sense it too. An energy all around us. Mark and Helen, let us not forget that we are here for scientific facts, not whimsical thoughts. When the mind starts thinking the way you two are, it can get carried away with itself and see things it wants to. I'm sorry, Mr. Price. Do not apologise. Mr. Price is not entirely factual. Right, shall we begin? I call to the spirits of Borley Rectory. Come forward and communicate. We are here to help you. Please, come forward. Use our energies. Use our bodies for your energies. We are here to help you. Please come and talk to us. I know you are there, hiding away, just watching. Now is the time to come forward and make yourself known to us. Someone is here. I sense somebody too. Come closer. We know you are here. I see a woman. She is crying, whimpering in the corner. Come forward, I cannot see your face. Move forward. You seem friendly. Come and communicate. We are not here to harm you. And do you see it? She's behind Mark. I do not see it. Please refrain from calling her it. I cannot see her, but I feel her here. Is she still behind me? She's turning to face me. Oh, she is scared. She is afraid. What is she afraid of? Do you have a name? What is your name, my dear? Marie is her name. She's there. Is she the only one? She's just a child in mind. Ask if she's the one that haunts us. - Is she the only one who- - She heard you. Wait, she is not the only one here, but she is the original. - We should end this now. - No, don't break the circle. Something is all around her. It's an energy, it's all consuming. Does it have a name? You don't understand. It is not a person. It is an ancient energy. I am feeling very uncomfortable. We need to end this now. It's the negative energy. It's trying to strangle me. - We must stop. - No! This is the science I am seeking. I am trying to break free, but it won't let me. Very well, break the circle. Is she gone? I didn't mean to startle you. You be all right? I'm now at peace, but thank you. It be early. It's surprising to see someone here. - I thought maybe- - You thought I was her? The nun who haunts here. Yeah. Wow, strange things go on around here. Lights and sounds. You spent the night here? I didn't sleep, but I couldn't stay a minute longer. First train ain't for another hour. My name is Estelle Roberts, I'm a spiritualist medium. Basil Payne, I own all the land back of the lawn. I'd shake your hand, but I've been tending to my animals. Have you seen her? Oh, I know who you are talking of. I haven't, but I've seen plenty of other strange happenings. My family have lived around here for years. They tell tales. I prefer to stay away. What's the rectory's business stays there. Oh, I agree. It was a place of great joy once, but now a dark force surrounds it. Take my advice and you never come back here. You leave it be. I will take your advice. So, you've experienced your first week at Borley Rectory. Seen the highs and the lows. Was it what you all expected? For me, a little disappointing. It has been interesting, but I- - For me, it has not lived up to its expectations. Good. Then there was the Estelle Roberts seance, which I didn't witness. Somebody must be on visual 24 hours a day. We might miss an important event. I did, the seance. Miss Roberts has the ability to project things into susceptible minds. It did seem real to me, but I'm interested in doing my own seances, so when will that happen, Mr. Price? All in good time. I wish to explore more. We look at your rigid blue book each night. Yes, well we must conduct our investigations with rigid purpose. We must be meticulous in our investigation. A time will come when we can't do all of these. I for one, feel like we are achieving anything. That's what the rectory wants. It wants you to give up. But we all want to experience something. - Anything. - And you will! Then put our minds at rest. You have spent periods of time here at the rectory, what we have seen and heard is minimal. Yes, how can we be so sure that the rectory is the most haunted house in all of England? What have you experienced? Burning. The smell of burning. When I previously visited Borley, I slept in a room at the rear of the house. It was a small bedroom, not much light. I sometimes considered whether I was being forced to sleep there. But this story begins before that. And to truly understand my passion, you must first know my reasonings for it. We are all ears, Mr. Price. For as long as I can remember when I was a child, I was always overwhelmed by the sensation that I could smell burning. It was my recurring nightmare. Night terrors my family would call it. Like a bonfire, sometimes it would be stronger, other times hardly there. I'd grown accustomed to the smell. Even forgotten all about it. At least once a week until it came time for me to leave the family home to go to university. I was saying my goodbyes to everyone and when I spoke to my mother, I asked her to finally air my bloody room out. I think she misunderstood at first, until I elaborated and explained about the smell in my childhood nightmares. Her face went very pale, unnaturally so. Like a wave had gone over it. And almost as quickly as it came, it passed. She smiled, wished me the best, I left for university. It was at university that my mind kept returning to this exchange, to how my mother looked in that moment. And it began to pull at a thread. Well, the house I was raised in was a normal home with its own history. Unremarkable, you might say. Except for one thing, one tragedy my mother told me. An old woman had lived there in the 1700s. She was known to be something of a miser, unkind. And keen to say we she could, she would only ever light the fire in the smallest room of the house. Well, they were unsure how it happened, but there was a freak accident. A relative found her, burned to death in the room. My room. Now, you may say that it was all just a coincidence, and yet the funny thing is, I only ever had the nightmares while I was in my family home. While I was at university, I never once had a night terror. Bloody hell. I used stronger words than that, I can tell you. And it was at that point that I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to solve mysteries. Well, you wanted the reasonings behind Harry Price. And there it is. But do you want to know the real mystery? Tell me why after years of no nightmares, how it is that I should experience that same sensation, the smell of burning on the very first night I slept in that back room here at Borley Rectory. Good night. It was 1931, in the previous few years, Marianne had had a few interesting paranormal events happen to her. Looking to do simple tasks because the maid was away for the weekend, Marianne found herself in a part of the rectory that she didn't usually visit. She's frozen in that moment. Hesitant to turn around because she knows at that time she is alone in the rectory. And as she turns, she is terrified. She she's a nun-like figure and she is frozen with fear. An overwhelming sense of helplessness comes over her. Marianne sinks to her knees. She is in pain. She senses a figure walking towards her. And then, Marianne looks up and in that moment... The nun is no more. Hello? - Was it you? - Me? Three nights in a row, bright lights, bells ringing. Lights? Where's Mr. Price? - Payne? - Ah, there you are Mr. Price. Three nights in a row now. Bells from the church ringing, intense lights from the rectory. Mark, has anything like this been recorded? No, Mr. Price, nothing. I am confused. Please come in. If you have witnessed a phenomenon, then we must record it. Are you telling me that you haven't been doing any extraordinary experiments? Well, nothing that would conclude with what you have witnessed. Look, come inside and we can record this. No, leave it be. My animals are scared. And now, I'm scared. I want nothing more to do with this rectory. I leave it alone. It leaves me alone. Roger, you should've recorded this. Considering our situation, I don't think there's anything that could. As in my eyes, I'm still unsure if it even happened at all. Harry wants us to record everything. If I must. My brother is a little weak sometimes. Yes, forgive me for saying, but he strikes me as bit of a wet blanket. And whether he is even up to this. Well, we'll just have to wait and see to find out then, won't we? - Mr. Price? - Ah, there you are. I thought you'd abandoned us completely. Where's Roger? I thought he was on shift? He's feeling a little under the weather. Oh, yes. I heard what happened. I've sent your father a message. Roger may have to return to London. I am unsure that he has the constitution for this kind of work. The rectory has seen him as the weaker one of us. It's latched onto his fear. I shall await your father's instructions, but you may have to leave to escort Roger back home. But I don't want to leave. Well, it'll be at least 24 hours before I receive a response. I've decided to make the best use of the time we all have together and move up to the next stage of the investigation. The simplest of tools, my dear boy. This simplest of tools. Are you okay? Are you? Don't be foolish. Did I scare you? - Yes! - Good. Roger, where are the others? I don't know. But can you hear that ringing? Oh, God. What is it? My hand, the air, it's cold. Ice cold. I want out of this place. You're right. Absolutely right. The wire, it's moving. I don't want to be here a moment longer. Don't worry, we shall be leaving soon. - What is it? - It's moving. It's actually moving. She's here. Price, no! I, I, I, I have some matches. Here, let me light one. I have to leave with him. Father couldn't come and collect us, and Roger is in no fit state to travel alone. I understand. At least the rectory got what it wanted. And what is that? You and Mr. Price to itself. I'm sorry, dear boy. I didn't mean to scare you. - I thought it was- - What did I tell you about having thoughts? The rectory will get to you too soon. Now that Roger and Helen have both retreated, it's just me and you. But don't worry, I've made arrangements for our final week. What is next? I think we need to take things up a gear. Let's get this packed away and we'll see what we can conjure up before dinner. Chop chop. What perplexes you, Mark? I'm really not too sure to be honest. I'm just grappling with my own recollection of events. Well, that's always the difficulty isn't it? That's why using a witness can be a difficult way to corroborate an event. How so? Say you meet a friend at a train station. You haven't seen each other in some time. You drink together, you talk, you laugh, you part company and then you decide to tell the next person you see what happened. Well, you recount the event almost perfectly, word for word, conversation for conversation, but still, small details slip. Mistakes are made. You're asked, what did your friend wear? And you think, was it a red tie or was it a blue? - Memory. - Memory. It's why note taking, photographic proof, these are all vital in trying to piece together exactly what happened. Because memory can be fallible. Exactly. At least, that's what I recall. What is that? I know that it is not us. It's coming from the blue room. The room, it's freezing. So it is. Mark, feel the books. Dear, God, Harry. They're so cold. It isn't the books, it's the wall. Help me with the bed. The wall is ice cold. It's reacting with the air in the room. It's made it damp. There's dredger of flour in the suitcase. - Fetch it for me. - Will do, what's it for? Normally, I lay it of the floor for footprints, but watch. Harry, have you taken leave of your senses? I have not, dear boy. I have not. The flour acts as a binding agent. Where the wall is damp it will stick. You try. You see? What is... Get the camera. We need to record this. It's gone. Indeed it has. So, how was London? Good, though I feel the society need additional information if they were to pursue this further. - How's young Roger? - Better. Poor chap wasn't up to the challenge. I'm glad you could come back. Ah, may I assume you have a few things around? Look, I feel that we're closer to something now. Maybe even a breakthrough. Breakthrough to what? Ah, well, that's the question isn't it? So, what's your theory? Well, I think this place acts as a conduit, a connection, a doorway for those that pass through. - Like a tunnel? - Yes, if you will. And the nun? Hm, she is lost. Trapped, perhaps in a cycle, unable to escape. Possessed by this ancient evil energy. Very well. How on earth do we try and communicate with that? Well, I firmly believe that this is a science. It's just not an exact science. But I think we can communicate, set her free, and give the haunting of Borley Rectory a complete ending. How long has it been? Yes, yes, it has been hard work, but we're nearly there. I don't intend for this continue beyond the six months. Well, I should like to thank you all for returning. Sadly, Mr. Payne declined my offer. Your six months turned into a year. Yes, they did. With the help of Reverend Henning. Now the time has come to sell the rectory and with regret, I must conclude my investigations here. But I'm certain the new occupants will extend you the same courtesy that we have. I'm afraid not. Captain Gregson is the new occupant, and he wants nothing to do with Mr. Price. And in his own words, "Ghosts are the ravings of a lunatic." But I feel I have achieved as much as I could in the last 12 months. And until such a day science exceeds what we have now, well, I'm afraid this is the end for Borley Rectory and its investigations. What, is that it? But what happened? What did you record? You promised new evidence. Charles, my dear boy, what I'm about to tell you goes way beyond evidence. But it must never leave this room. - Why? - That is my tender. It must remain here at Borley. Marianne, are you quite sure you wish me to recount this story? Harry, please do tell. Whatever is here can no longer harm me. We are listening. On several occasions from that point on, Sidney, Mark and Helen came and went. But not a single noteworthy paranormal event happened in the rectory over the next three months. But it was just a front. A pause in proceedings for what was about to happen. And it will stay with me for the rest of my life. I shall start, as is customary at the beginning. It's like the house was asleep or just resting. But hell was about to wake us all. Harry, it's okay, it's okay. Did you see something? Just a nightmare. - I should record it. - No. Mark, it isn't noteworthy. As you were. Tea? Better? Mildly, yes. What was it? My own death if that could be. Yes. Then it's entirely true, isn't it? Indeed. You wanted to communicate with whatever it is that exists, - I firmly believe- - It already is communicating. Exactly. We need everyone. Absolutely. Helen is back. And so is somebody I didn't think I would ever see again. Marianne. I do hope this'll be the very last time you summon my presence here. Ladies and gentlemen, we should begin. Firstly, I should like to thank you for coming here today. Often, what we do can be seen as idealistic or worse, hysterical. But I think we're neither of those. I think we're pioneers, on the edge of discovering something truly incredible. For almost 12 months now, we've recorded and catalogued all the different phenomena that have happened here at the rectory. And I believe we are now on the cusp of real communication. And this seance is the last roll of the dice, as it were. Our last attempt at discovering what lies beyond our world. To find the truth and to release the negative energy that haunts here. So, unless there are any objections, let us begin. Firstly, I would ask for everyone to hold hands with another. Fingertip to fingertip. I will of course be using the planchette at some point, but let us try the old way. Good. The reason for this is simple. It's to ensure that no fowl play, as it were, is taking place. Although, I doubt that any of you are pranksters at heart. Thank you, Mr. Price. However, from this moment on, I shall be the only one to speak, so the spirit knows who to channel through. Secondly, a medium would usually ask for all to keep their eyes closed throughout this process. However, I would like all eyes to be open and my eyes shall remain closed. Let us begin. My name is Helen Glanville. I am joined here today with family, friends, and colleagues. Sidney Glanville, Mark Kerr-Pearse, Harry Price, and finally, Marianne Foyster whom you may already know. I shall knock three times. If you can hear the knocking, please respond with one knock. Very well. Again, I shall knock three times. If you are here, please respond with one knock. Mark, perhaps we should- Oh, thank you. Spirits, who shall I address you as? Spirits, I shall simply ask you some questions. Knock once for yes, twice for no. Is that clear? Do you know this place? Do you know the people in this room? Are you watching us? Can you move on? Are you trapped? Are you in pain? Is someone hurting you? Another spirit perhaps? The know someone else? Is that other spirit here in this room? Lantern. It was her. The real her. Look! Helen. Helen! Harry, what is it? This building's a conduit filled with spirits. But they're all scared of the same thing. A ghost, any old ghost? I don't think it's a ghost. Helen. Helen? Helen isn't here. Who are you? We are everyone. Those who have lived. Those who have died. Died? Release her! Release my daughter! No. We are safe here. We can hide. - Hide? - They are hiding inside her. That's what they wanted. Hiding from whom? Oh, my God! It can't harm us, can it? No, only the dead. It can only harm the dead. That was it, wasn't it? You brought us here, you drew us here to open the doorway, to pass through to the other side and hide! Hide within my daughter. But you can't, I won't let you! Sidney, no. Let us escape this torment. We must escape this torment. Of course. They're trapped, unable to move on by her. She's feeding off them. Feeding off their terror. But Helen, they can't take Helen! But they can take me. Mark. Helen didn't want this. I don't want this. - Mark, no, you can't- - Harry, it's fine. - Mark, no. - Please. I'm sorry, Helen. Mark! Mr. Price? As I said, Inspector, it was a fall. A fall you say? Mighty odd. Seems to have no bruising at all. And you'd conclude this too, Mrs. Foyster? It was a terrible accident. The rectory is very rundown. It's a death trap. Hm. To avoid suspicion, I'm afraid we'll have to wait until dawn before we make our final exit. Do you think Mark will make a full recovery? Yes. He is strong. Give him time, he should pull through. Remember he lived here with me for almost a year. I have lived here for many more. I have seen Mark's condition before. It was in a young girl and it occurred during one of my early investigations back before the war. They fully recovered. Mark will too. I do hope so. What's more important is that my time here at Borley has come to a conclusion. And the hauntings have been extinguished. Have they? Well, she is free. Do you deny what was seen by us all? Remember, I have lived here for a very long time. Do you still feel her presence? Yes. Marianne? You are what I truly have been seeking. Yes. What are you? I am the everything. From the monastery? From a time before time. I am forever. Do you want to feel it? The energy? My energy? No! You must! Harry! What's happened? I witnessed something. You may have a fever. What is it? It's you. - It's you. - Of course it's me. I left you to sleep. But we'll miss our train if you don't get up soon. Yes. I'll get my belongings. The night of the terrible fire that engulfed Borley Rectory was a cold one. Captain Gregson was the only tenant after my occupancy, which was only six months after I departed and recounted my story to my friends and colleagues. Nobody knows how the fire started, and many myths have surrounded the reasons. I for one, believe it was the demonic force that had decided it did not want to give away any more of its secrets. The war was fast approaching and the rectory was left to decay. Nobody will ever be able to achieve what I did in those 12 short months. The mystery of Borley Rectory will live on into the next generation and beyond.
