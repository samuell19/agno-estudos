[music playing] [rhythmic tapping] [music playing] [wind blowing] [music playing in headphones] [music playing in headphones] [choking] [music playing in headphones] [typing] [door closing] [rapid typing] [tearing paper] [music playing] [rock music playing] [cheering] MAN: Hey! Do it! [music] I don't even know how this started. Now I'm in too deep because your man won't dance. Getting better. So good. You have time for now. All the time with you. Doing time for me. We all do aware too. [men catcalling and whistling] If you think you can you will run my life, but my love for you is like a sharpened knife. Doing time for now. All the time with you. Doing time for me. We all do aware too. Someday soon, I will be gone, far away from here. Someday soon, I'll be dancing. Maybe [inaudible],, but you won't know me then. Doing time for now. All the time with you. [glass breaking] [screaming] [glass breaking] All the time with you. Doing time for me. We all do our way too. Doing time. [grunts] Doing time. Doing time. Doing time. Doing time. [glass breaking] Doing time. Doing time. Doing time. Doing time. Hi there. Doing time. Doing time. Doing time. Doing time. [grunts] [horns] [knocks] Mai Lin? Let me explain! [knocks] Mai Lin? [playing bluesy harmonica] [bell ringing] [man singing in non-english] I want out, Slater. No way, Mai Lin. Not now. What's so special about now? What am I supposed to look for this time? A small silver case. I want you to call me when they're moving out their next chip. And if I decide to walk instead? I wouldn't do that if I were you. It wouldn't be smart. What do they have on you? I was on tour, dancing. And a friend of mine put some drugs in my suitcase. I got caught. Some friend. Slater, if I get this for you, am I out? SLATER: It's not up to me, kid. You owe me this. I don't owe you anything, lady. You're a bastard. [music playing] Excuse me. I'm looking for a copy of "Tao Te Ching." [non-english speech] we [non-english speech] He'll be right with you. Oh, you speak English. Yeah. Do you speak Chinese? - No, no. Only-- only read it. Oh, good. [non-english speech] It's free of charge. No. I-- I-- I couldn't. Oh, it's all right. It's a gift. You did something for us. We give you something in return. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. I am honored. Thank you. Good day. If you would only tend to your business as well as you tend these trees. You should never have had to appear in that club. You are Sakura. For years, our family has controlled that neighborhood. You must control without controlling. The club owner showed you no respect, Hanzo. If he cannot respect you, he will not respect our family. Those streets are your training grounds. You must learn how to wield power, my son. Because the Sakura family is becoming more powerful as each day passes. The soul is the seat of power. The way to act is to be. The man who acts without his center is a leaf in the wind. Are you a leaf in the wind, my son? I will not disappoint you again, father. Good. And now I will give you a chance to prove that. Look at that silver case behind you, on the rocks. This case must get to its destination safely. Within it is a power few on earth possess. A power for you and the future of the Sakura. Be aware of that, my son. This time there must be no mistakes. When is the pick up? In two days. You must oversee every detail. You will not know the transport agents. And remember, no weapons. The Americans have sent an operative to recover the case, Colonel Slater. And they are watching our other operations closely. You must not fail. One more thing. The heart is full of trickery. In your affairs with this dancing girl, be careful. It is dangerous to have one who is not one of us so close. [humming sound] [radio playing pop music] Now I'm in too deep, because your man won't dance. Getting better. So good. Doing time for now. All the time with you. Doing-- [screams] [screams] [screams] [screaming] Yee-ha! Yeah! Whoo! Party time, ladies. Party time. [non-english speech] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [inaudible]. Hey, get the stuff. Get the stuff. Get the stuff. Your elixir of the evening for a little experimentation. Yeah, yeah, yeah? [sounds of assent] Oh! Very good? Oh! Oh yeah, very good. Do you want some? Ah, baby. Oh, hey there, buddy. Welcome to the party. Relax. There's plenty for both of us. No problem. You and I could have a party that will knock your socks off. I agree with them. Yeah. Hey! Easy with the chicks, huh? [laughs] Hey, you've got to relax. It's just a party. Whatever it is, drinky-poo? Party hat? Have a little drink. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that on your suit. [chokes] [laughs] [grunts] Hey, popular on top. Mm. Party time. [door closing] [laughs] [grunting] [sounds of fighting] [laughing] Ah! GIRL: [screams] [music playing] We all do aware too. Doing time. Doing time. Doing time. Hey! Don't take it so seriously. [laughs] Come on. Come on. Here. Look. Come on. Baseball fans, huh? - [non-english speech] - Oh, yeah. Me too. Yeah. What's this? [laughs] You've got to be kidding. Huh? Who's going to know, right? Babe Ruth. There you go. [non-english speech] OK. [shouts with joy] I was nearly hurt. This is business. [non-english speech]. Mai Lin, I promise you it won't happen again. I hope not. What about tonight? Can we get together? [playing bluesy harmonica] What about it? I'll think about it. [rhythmic non-english speech] [laughs] [non-english speech]. [rhythmic non-english speech] [non-english speech]. [rhythmic non-english speech] [grunts] [clapping] Bravo. Bravo. Now that is a lot different than what I saw the other night. What are you doing here? Well, I-- you remind me of someone I used to know. How'd you get in here? I danced. Chen! Chen! Get this guy out of here. But you don't understand, sir. I'm the dance critic from the Pittsburgh Press, you see. And that's something that I think you should know. [grunts] Oh, now he wants to dance with me. OK. Shall I lead, or shall you lead? Yeah! I'll lead. Anyway, I was thinking you and I could get together soon. Oh, here we go with this guy again. Hey! Well, I guess you'll just have to catch my review in the evening paper. [grunts] [moans] [rhythmic non-english speech] [non-english speech] [thud] [fighting grunts] [bluesy harmonica music] [water bubbling] [non-english speech] Huh? [non-english speech] [non-english speech]. Yeah, I'll come back. I'll come back. OK, give me my hat. Give me my-- very tired. Thank you, though. Thank you. Kiss you. [kiss] Thank you. [non-english speech] I'll come back. Yeah. [non-english speech] [harmonica music] [thud] [grunts] [screams] Ugh. Oh. Ho! [screams] Ah! [grunts] Ugh. [thwack] [rattling] [grunts] I bought this myself. It's for you. Hanzo, you didn't have to do this. What is it? [paper rustling] Thank you. I like the smell on you. Here. You do it. Mai Lin, that's not all I want. [knocking] [laughs] [slap] Uh! Mai Lin, not you! [smack] Ah! Come on. Slater. Something's going down at the boathouse tonight. [dog barking] He said to go without weapons. Yeah. POLICEMAN: Freeze! Don't move! [gunshot] Ah! I said, freeze! Don't move! Get that light back on. Go get him. I want him alive. [screams] [fighting grunts] [non-english speech] Where's the white silver case. No more asking, buddy. Where's the white silver case? Get the light on the water! Who are you? Well now, that's a starter. Who are you? Who do you work for? I don't work for anybody. Not if I can help it. Look, I don't like to play games. Oh, well, now for some reason, I find that hard to believe. We all do what we have to do. There's got to be more to life than that. What do you want from me? I tole you. You remind me of somebody I used to know. And you've got a great ass. Look, whoever you are, stay away from Hanzo. He's bad for your health. Oh, you mean the guy in the Al Capone suit? Is that your boyfriend? Hey, what's your name? Mai Lin. See you around, Mai Lin. Hey. Lose your bearings, friend? Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah. I'm new around here. What about yourself? Are you a tourist? - No. Head of State, in hiding. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, tell me there, Willi, how did you like the weather in Tibet? [chuckles] Fine, fine. How's Mai Lin? Oh, she's fine. Fine. [battle cries] I brought by the silver case, Father. And for that I am thankful. Slater is more clever than I thought. Have you noticed anything unusual or out of the ordinary in the last few days? There's one thing. Something two of my men said. But it's stupid. Crazy. Nothing is too small to consider. They were talking about a white ninja. But it was just a punk. Three kids. Why didn't you tell me this sooner? What else did they say? They said he could fly. Fly? And did they see his face? No. What is it, Father? Your grandfather used to talk of the White Ninja, a renegade clan and a dangerous enemy. It was the only time I saw uncertainty in his eyes. Yet he always said their true strength was also their weakness, compassion. He said they could fly. Surely this is a trick-- All we know, this White Ninja is working with Slater. Now, do we have a new site for the pickup? Yes. My men will check it out. I chose them myself. We must find who betrayed us. I have killed the men who betrayed us, Father. Are you so sure? There is no one left. Ah, my son. There must be someone left. Mai Lin has nothing to do with this! [thunder] [seagulls cawing] [energetic music] [hitting sounds] [grunts] [screaming] [sighs] [fighting grunts] [thud] If you come here to cause trouble, you're dead. Seems to me you've had enough trouble lately. [non-english speech]. I'm not sure I understand you. Your ranks seem to be thinning. Hm. The garden must be weeded, the tree trimmed. But the Gardener should choose the time and the place. It's none of your business. You come from a great family. Why do you dishonor its traditions? You know nothing of my family. To be a shadow, first you must have substance. First lesson of a ninja. What do you know about ninja, American? Maybe nothing. But I do know this. Your world is crumbling all around you, and pretty soon you'll have nothing left, including Mai Lin. [thwack] That's your triumph and your funeral, ninja. [cat meowing] How'd you get in here? I danced, remember? I've been thinking about you. I should blow you away. Why? You afraid of me? No. I just wanted to talk to you. OK. Talk. What do you see in that guy? Hanzo? It doesn't make sense. So what makes sense? Whores? [scoffs] Well, not really. I-- I choose my partners. How about you? Who are you, anyway? A drunk? A drifter who spends his time playing basketball and sleeping with whores? Nothing serious to you, is it? Some things. What's your name? Willi. What are you running away from, Willi? A woman? Dancer. I watched her get killed, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. And you? Mistake. Bad mistake. Where have you been? None of your business. Everything you do is my business. We've been unable to locate the silver case. Wait a minute. I held up my end of the deal. You screwed up, it's not my fault. I'm out of this game. No you're not. I need for you to find out when and where they're moving out the next ship. Then what? Then you can leave with your new boyfriend. What are you talking about? You're getting sloppy, kid. You haven't got any idea who he is working for. He doesn't work for anybody. How do you know? Woman's intuition, or could it be because you're sleeping with him. Your judgment is off. What I do with my private life is my own business. You haven't got a private life anymore. There's enough weapons grade plutonium out there to blow up any city in this world. If that plutonium gets into the wrong hands, we could all be history. Now, you haven't got the slightest idea who your boyfriend is working for, and neither do I. And I aim to find that out. I'll get you the information you want, but this is the last time. Willi. Hey. [mumbles] [harmonica music] Did you get that from the American? Tall man with a baseball cap. [harmonica music] [sake bottle clattering] [door opening] [door closing] Your way of our people is hard. In the modern world, the old values are forgotten. A ninja must be a rock, with the sea raging all about him. The things most people take for granted, a friend, a lover, happiness, are of no importance to the ninja. He may play at these other roles, but he must remain aloof, loyal only to his family. You'll know what you have to do. [music playing] And I'm coming into the light. And now I'm digging out of my skin. Another day when I've moved on. Never crying out for help. Now I'm getting over the fear. Now I'm getting over his lies. Letting go of the crazy dream. [inaudible] You believe in me. And all that you want, I'll be. With the will to drive and the strength rise. And I'll dance to the drum, dance to the drum, and then drum that beat. And now I'm reaching back over you. And you ever see what I see. After all the [inaudible] that you burned, now the smoke has blown away. You believe in me. All that you want, I'll be. With the will to try and the strength to rise. And they'll dance to the drum. Dance to the drum and then drum that beat. Oh, oh, oh yeah. Hanzo! [screaming] [inaudible]. Yes. Hi. [car horns] How are you doing, Willi? Mai Lin is dead. And who's Mai Lin? Ninja killed her, Slater. OK. Friend of yours gets wasted, and you come into my office. [raps table] I don't get it. Why don't you contact the local police? Well maybe I'll do that. They might be kind of interested in knowing why she's got your phone number, Slater. Beats me, buddy. Well, why don't we ask Hanzo? You're starting to wear out your welcome. What the hell is going on here, Slater? What does this mean? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Well, what the hell does mean anything to you, Slater? Whose side are you on, brother? Mine. Mine. [cor horn] [fighting sounds] [cries out] [grunts] [battle cry] [choking] [screams] [gasping] [coughs] [screams] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [screams] Ah! [punching sounds] [panting] [grunts and battle cries] [wind rustling through trees] [thunder] [battle cries] [battle cries] [battle cries] [battle cries] HANZO'S FATHER (VOICEOVER): He would tell of their strength and courage, yet he always said their true strength was also their weakness, compassion. (ECHOING) [screams] White Ninja! You have killed my son, but never again will you threaten the Sakura! [gunshot] [grunts] [panting] [car horn] [bluesy harmonica music] [sticks tapping rhythmically] [light eastern music playing]
