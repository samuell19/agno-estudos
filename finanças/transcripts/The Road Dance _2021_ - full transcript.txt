(Traditional Scottish violin and bagpipe music) (Waves crashing) (Child laughing) Kirsty... Come on! Let's get you dry. What did we learn? - Move our arms... - and then what? Kick our feet... - And the most important thing? - Don't forget to breathe. (Laughs) That's right, my girl, don't forget... Don't forget... to breathe. (Ship horn blowing) Have you ever been on one that big? No, this one's for fishing. Where's it going? I don't know. Could be taking tea to India or silk to China... ...or people like us... to a kinder place. And where's that, Father? Lots of people set their sights for America, seeking a fresh start. A better life. Can we go there? Aye... perhaps. My little dreamer. (Woman) Eyes up, Kirsty. I said eyes up. Those were mine, Mam. Mrs Macleod... I've brought you some crushed shells for your bed. Oh, that's kind of you to think of us, lain. Thank you. Kirsty, let me help you. We're doing just fine. Aren't we, Annie? Thank you. Well, I suppose we're... we're almost done here, so... - Will you be going to the gathering? - If Ma lets us. OK. Maybe see you then. (Sheep bleating) - Bye, then. - Mrs Macleod. We could use a man's help around here, Kirsty. Ah... Mam. - Lain Ban is... - He's a good lad. He's a good lad from a strong family. And he's building a two story house... ...with a slate roof, a stove and a kitchen. I know, Mam. Can we go? Ma? Fine... but back before sundown. (Upbeat traditional violin music) Should I get washed? No, he'd probably like the dirt. Don't dawdle, lad. I'll catch up. - Kirsty... - Hi, Callum. - Annie... - Callum... - I've learn a new tune. - Oh... I'll play it for you. - Well, you are coming? - Aye, so you'd better be good. I'll see you there. Kirsty Macleod! Might I have a word? Yes, ma'am. I'll just go ahead, then. I see the lads courting you. Or is your head too full of dreams to notice? I hope your Bible's near. Of course, Peggy. It's right here. I'd best catch up with my sister. (Music continues) - I'm going to get you for that. - (Laughter) Oh, hello, Angus. Don't you dare! Here you go now, here's a wee one for you, eh. - Gentlemen... - And for the good doctor. - Here you are. - Thank you. You'll not get that in London now, eh? - God's medicine, eh? - God's medicine. - (In satisfaction) Argh... - You want another one? No - Murdo 'Books'. - You're back. Only one who I know who goes to a gathering to read. Must be good. - Such a righteous lad... - Shut your mouth, lain Ban! At least young Murdo serves his country. What, by throwing scripture at the enemy? Lain. Give us the book. - Good to have you back, lad. - Thank you, sir. - Murdo... America. - Oh! - Came while you were away. - Thanks, Pete. - You're welcome. - Murdo. Murdo! Alasdair! Are you going to play us a tune, Callum? Murdo 'Books'? Shh! (Annie laughs) (Traditional violin music) I hate it when they call you that... Murdo 'Books'. So you're reading the Bible, then? Aye... ...but things are not always as they seem. The Old Curiosity Shop. What?! That's sacrilegious. Self-protection... they think I'm already odd enough as it is. So how was it, Glasgow? Full of excitement and beautiful women? More like drudgery... training till our feet fall off. Are you afraid they might send you over, with what's happening with the war? I'd already be there were it not that I could type having me process recruits, sending coded messages, telegrams to mums and dads letting them know their wee boy died fighting for King and Country. - Plus, they've seen me with a rifle. - (Laughs) Another gift from your uncle? Robert Frost... All right. OK. It's poetry. It's not pirates and peg legs. Sacrilege. Do you want to go? To America? I guess I've never allowed myself to think about it. Well, I'm going. I want more than planting potatoes and farming the same land as my Ma and Da. I want to visit the places your Frost writes about. Go where his characters go. - Be with... - Well, let's go then. It's just a dream. Why must we always be so secretive? Well, I wouldn't worry about Skipper. I'm not sure I've ever heard a peep out of him. Today would have been his birthday. I know. I miss him every day. Do you remember how he'd dance with us? You do remember. (Shoes clattering on floor) You're so like him. I'm sorry, Mam. It isn't fair. It's God's will. Just his time to go. Right, let us read the books. I don't remember him... Da. I remember his laugh. He was always laughing. (Whispering) Unlike Ma. (Laughs) Just how do you plan to do that? That's none of your business. (Clattering) (Man) To look away from the Lord, is to look towards hell itself. Everlasting torment is the certain end for those who do not believe. But there can be a living hell on earth for those who chose acts not worthy of the Lord. So let us ne'er forget what happened right here with one of our own. A girl... out of wedlock... who looked to temptations of the flesh. - I'm sorry I got cross with you last night. - That's all right. It's what we do. (Whispering) (Violin music) - Murdo 'Books'? - (Laughs) Angus, my sister fancies you. And what about you, Kirsty? Who do you fancy? I fancy the Lord. Now we're even. (Kirsty) You're going to get me in trouble. (Murdo) Me? It's just over this hill. It seems the Minister preached a sermon just for us today. Are you having improper thoughts about me, Kirsty Macleod? Perhaps Old Peg put him up to it. (Gentle music) What do you think? It's beautiful. You know, I haven't been here since I was a wee girl. My Da brought us to play for hours. Do you know my Dad, he never learnt how to swim. He said it would only prolong the end. Imagine that, eh? A fisherman who couldn't swim. One day he goes out... ...terrible storm. And he's gone, just like that. It's been hardest on my mum... and Alasdair. I don't know what's worse... ...watching your dad die from a slow cancer... ...or having him just not come home. So you're telling me you can't swim? No. Well, we're going to have to fix that. Come on. Is this part of your plan? (Music builds) Kirsty, I'm sorry, I... You're the most beautiful, loveable girl. I mean it. - (Chicken squawks) - Hold still. Is there anything that you would like to tell me? No. Where were you yesterday? I was reading. I lost track of time. Kirsty, no boy is going to want a girl with her head stuck in the clouds - reading stories and poems. - You mean lain Ban. Fine. Right, these last two need skirted and then taken to Peter before dark. - I'll do it. - It's your sister's turn. You can take some eggs to Skipper. (Wind rustling through the long grass) Skipper. It's Kirsty Macleod. - I have some eggs for you from my Mam. - (Bell rings) Oh. There you are. Is that the Statue of Liberty? Right, well, erm... goodbye Skipper. What's it like to kiss a boy? To kiss Murdo? You read my diary? Didn't have to. It's like... It's like time stops. And I can feel his breath... ...him next to me. And I don't want it to end. You can't tell Ma. What would Angus kiss like? - You shut your mouth. - (Both laugh) (Man 1) ...around Christmas, is it? (Man 2) Well, hopefully... (Man 1) Yeah. I hope.. What's going on? It came in this morning... calling for all the lads. We're going with you, Murdo. They say if we volunteer, they'll keep us all together. 'Pals battalions' they call them. Yes, so we're all going. Proud of you, lads. You're all coming home safe and sound now, you hear? Doctor's orders. In the meantime, we have something to keep everyone's spirits up. Peter and I've been talking. When did we last have a road dance? You up for it, lads? Get your dancing feet on, eh? (Waves lapping on shore) Well, it wasn't pretty, but at least now you can swim. (Murdo shivering) - And what did we learn? - Er... - ...move my arms. - Aye... And kick your feet. And then? (Gentle music) Don't forget to breathe. We should go. (Music continues) - What's that? - The future. Look. And this is how we get there. What?! What is it? I've been called to England... ...and to the Western Front. I thought you were to be kept in Glasgow because of... Well, that's all changed. Can you just not go? Universal conscription... There's no choice... we're all going. It isn't fair. - Please don't cry. - Why are we even fighting this war? - It isn't even ours. - Hey, look, with any luck... I'll still be behind my desk. They're saying it might be all over by Christmas. What? Tell me. I do love you, Kirsty Macleod. And I love you, Murdo MacAulay. When I return, I'll marry you. And we'll make a new life together in America. That's if you'll have me. Yes, yes, of course. Until then, you've got Long John Silver to keep your company. (Laughs) Let me help you. Your hair always looks beautiful swept back. You're both so beautiful. Aye... but I'm the clever one. (Laughing gently) What is it, Ma? I got this dress when your Da and I were first courting. And I thought... Ah, it's beautiful. And, er, this brooch... Well, that belonged to my Mam. Thank you, Ma. Thank you, Ma. (Knocking) - Get dressed. - (Laughter) Mrs Macleod. These are for you. (Door creaking) Murdo... Mrs Macleod... these are for you. Oh, that's kind of you, Murdo. Come in. Thank you. Did, erm... did Kirsty, did she...? Yes, it's very kind of you to take her to the dance. Right... Right. Erm, it is my hon our, Mam. How's your Mam, Murdo? Oh, she's fine. Thank you for asking. Well, shall we? Of course. I'll see you there, Ma. Bye, Annie. Mrs Macleod. - (Door slams) - Callum... I'm so proud of you, son. That's enough of that, Morag. Plenty of time for that tomorrow. Come on, Angus. - Wahey! One more. - (Laughs) Good evening, Mam... Sir. - Murdo. - Mrs MacAulay, Minister. - You look beautiful, Kirsty. - Thank you. So do you. - We're going to, er... - Go. Well, tomorrow is the big day, eh? We all know you lads will make Gearrannan proud. Hello, Annie. Mairi, you look positively lovely. You're a good liar, but thank you, Doctor. Aren't you the lucky bastard? I guess I'll have to be play twice as brightly to stand any chance at all. Save us a dance, Kirsty. Me too, lass. But first things first. What's going on here, then? You started drinking without me? Afraid I'll have to arrest the lot of you. - Pour us a dram, Peter. - Here, you are. - Ooh, lovely... - Ah, ah, ah. Wait a minute. - To our departing lads! - Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear! Everybody, grab a partner. A schottische. - Ready lads? - (Up-tempo violin music) Dr Ma clean, time for our dance. Well, if you insist. You're a quiet one, Murdo 'Books'. So... you want to marry my sister? She told you? No, you did. Mind... mind if I cut in? Err... By all means, save me. - It's a beautiful night, Mam. - Aye... If only your Da could see you. - He'd be so proud. - I know. Come on, Alastair. (Clapping and tapping feet in time) (Chatter) Another please, Peter. Easy lad, eh? You're all right, lain? Plenty of lasses for you lads. More medicine, doc? - You know the answer to that one. - (Laughs) I have it on prescription. (Music continues) So, you... you fancy me? I mean, that, that is... well, what, what your sister said. I... I don't... Yes, I do. I just... didn't know you were such a good dancer. Kirsty, can I have a dance? - So, you're ready for tomorrow? - Are you and Murdo 'Books' together? That's none of your concern, lain. - So you and 'Books' are together. - First of all, 'Books' isn't his name. - And yes, lain. Murdo and I are... - lain, you blattered. - (Smacks) - (Grunts) You and your fancy talk. That's all you have! - Come on now, lain. That's enough. - You! Poor fool. Wasting your time. - I'm sorry. - Right. - (Man) Go home, lain. - You've got nothing... (lain) Wasting your time! I'm fine, Angus. I'm fine. Go and enjoy yourselves. And I like your fancy talk. Good, because I'm not much of a dancer. (Laughs) - Where are you going? - Just going to go for a wee. When the hurly-burly's done... Upon the heath! There she meets with brave McDougal (Traditional music continues in the background) (Waves crashing) (Footsteps) Is someone...? (Muffled) Ah... ah. - Shh. Shh! - Ah! (Moans) (Gasps) - Shh! - (Thud) (Anguished cries) (Foreboding music) Kirsty! Kirsty! Where are you?! Kirsty! Kirsty... Kirsty! I've been looking all over for you. Oh, your head. What on earth happened? I... I... I fell. I.. I... Listen, let's get you up, ok? Where's the doctor? She's hurt. Kirsty! Your head! He's already home. I'll tell him you're coming... Kirsty, what's happened? I fell... I... - I fell. - She doesn't remember anything. Angus, take Annie home, right? Tell her mum that I'm taking her to the doctor. All right, let's get you home. - (Bell rings) - (Banging on door) (Banging) Dr Ma clean, we need your help. Kirsty's hurt. Oh, fetch her inside. I'll tend to her. I'll get everything ready. Callum, tell them we're here and I'm with Kirsty. Put her inside, Murdo. There you go. Kirsty, it's Dr Ma clean. You're going to be fine. - What happened, son? - I don't know. She... she said she fell. It's a nasty bump. Murdo, er, I'll see to her from here. - Tell her mother. - Right... Tell Mairi she needs to stay overnight. You can come back first thing in the morning. - Go. - Go on, son. She's in good hands. All right. You'll just be fine, Kirsty. I'll be here when you wake. Off you go now, son. Come on, now. Sit yourself up. Drink this. It'll help. Right, all the way down now. That's it. Right, lie back. Come on. There we go. Kirsty, do you... do you remember what happened? Anything at all? I remember, erm... I remember... running around a hillock. I fell.. I fell and banged my head on a rock. Right, now. Come on. Never mind. You try and get some rest. Let me clean you up, all right? Just turn your head there a wee bit. (Winces) There you go. There we go. There's a brave girl. (Knocking on door and bell ringing) (Knocking on door) (Knocking on door) Morning, Murdo. - How is she? - Oh, she's fine. Cut on her head is clean. I gave her some stitches. Take care she doesn't touch them. She'll need to wear a bandage for some time. My Kirsty. - How are you? - (Winces suddenly) Kirsty... it's all right. Please take me home, Murdo. Of course. Could... could you just give me a minute. I need to, erm, I need to sort myself, please. Come on lad. Take your time, Kirsty. How are you feeling, lass? Will she be OK, Doc? Just a nasty bump, Murdo. She'll be as right as rain. Thank you, Doctor. Go home, go home. I'll see you off later. Let me at least walk you to the door. Kirsty! Kirsty, my God! What's happened to you? She doesn't remember anything. The doctor said to keep the bandage on and not touch the wound. Right, let's get you off your feet lass. Come on. Are you sure you're OK? (Sombre music) (Music builds) (Struggles) Shh! (Sombre music fades) I'll be all right, Mum. I know. (Melancholic music) And don't worry about us. We're fine. I'll be back soon. Come on, give us a hug. You're the man of the house now, aye? (Crying) Aye. Look after Mum, yeah? Kirsty... Sorry, I was just happy to see you. I've marked a page... that I memorised. When I'm gone and you read it, know that I'll be thinking of you. And if I don't return... ...inside is the cost for the fare and the address of my uncle. He already knows all about you. (Melancholic music) I love you so much, Murdo. I love you so much. And I, you, Kirsty Forever. My father gave this to me. I'll never take it off. - Sorry... - Gather round, lads. It's time. Goodbye, Kirsty. Listen lads, forget about the glory and remember the people you're fighting for back home. Your coming back... is victory enough. Lord God, Heavenly Father, we commit these men to you as they go off to fight in battle. Send your ministering angels to protect them... ...through your spirit of the strength and courage they have in you. Thank you, Lord, that we can trust you in all things. Please bring them home safely. Amen. ♪ Before me constantly ♪ I set the Lord alone ♪ Because he is at my right hand ♪ I'll not be overthrown ♪ Therefore, my heart is glad ♪ My tongue with joy will sing ♪ My body too will rest secure... ♪ Murdo! ♪ In hope unwavering ♪ You have made known to me Forever.. ♪ The path of life divine.

A wee better... - I'm just going to go, I'll catch up. - Kirsty... No, you need your rest. - I'll come with you. - No, I want to go alone. Doctor, thank you for taking such good care of my daughter. Oh, I'm just so sorry it happened. You know, I suspect her wounds go deeper than the gash in her head. Aye, I never had a son of my own. I suppose I've grown quite fond of young Murdo. - I know we all have. - Aye. See she gets her rest. If you need anything, you know where I am. Thank you. Annie, come on. (Wind howling) (Quiet dramatic music) (Music builds) (Sobbing) (Waves crashing) (Traditional music superimposed over eerie music) Stop! Stop! - Stop! - Kirsty, wake up. (Music stops abruptly) You were screaming, yelling, "Stop!" (Sighs) - (Knocking) - Kirsty. Just one moment... Kirsty... Kirsty, the Constable is here to see you. Why? I don't want to see him. Lass he's just come to check on you after what happened at the dance. All right? Sit up. Come on in. Well... eh... So sorry to bother you, Kirsty, but... Old Peg showed up at my door... said it was none of her business but... thought I should check on you after what happened. - Had yourself a fall, eh? - Aye... but I'll be fine. Must have been one hell of a tumble. I see the doctor has got you sorted though. Well, I best be going. - Bye. - Thanks, Constable. (Rustling) Let's just start from that side there. You can get in and start cutting in the corner here. (Slams book down and slams drawer shut) (Cutting) Aye. You're getting your strength back, I see. I'm glad. Me, too. "My Kirsty, I miss you so much already. "I'm sorry it's taken so long to write, "strict orders not to communicate during training. "How are you? Oh, I was so worried when you hurt your head. "Such a dreadful thing. I pray you're fully healed. "It's actually a happy enough time here. They've kept us all together. "Even now, as I put pencil to paper, "I feel as if I'm talking to you and you're listening. So I'm home. "I miss you dearly and I don't want to finish writing "because I've got so much to say. But I must. "My next letter will come from France. And how fancy that will be, eh? "With all my love...” “Forever... Murdo." (Sniffles) (Bell rings) For your Mum. Thank you, Skipper. And for you. You've been to America? Aye... but a long time ago. When I was your age. I think... you and your young man would like it there. "I actually spoke with Skipper today, or rather he spoke to me. "I suppose I misjudged him. Perhaps we all have. "And you won't believe it, "I've traded Long John Silver for the words of your Mr Frost. "There, I said it. "And am now seeing why you love him so..." (Footsteps crunching on gravel) (Vomits) - I have a letter, Pete. - Oh, of course, Kirsty. Aye, all seems to be in order. Get it out today. You all right, Kirsty? Aye. Erm, sorry. Hey... for more letters. Thank you, Pete. And what can I do for you, Peg? Just some yarn. (Vomits) Kirsty, you all right in there? Aye, uh, just my stomach, Ma. Kirsty. What's wrong? Tell me. - Talk about it... - Leave me alone, Annie?! Go! (Patter of rain) (Quiet dramatic music) (Tearing) I thought you'd never wake. You've been sleeping so much. I need you to fetch some potatoes. Tonight we're taking the doctor some dinner. Why? What do you mean why? Because he might enjoy some company. What is the matter with you these days? You don't even look like yourself. (Upbeat song plays in the background) Well, that was delicious, Mairi. Well, it's the least we could do after you've taken such good care of Kirsty. I can barely see that scar. Isn't that right, Kirsty? - Aye. - Yes, it's healed well. - You were married? - Annie! It's none of our business. No, no, it's all right. I was. Oh, no. No. I was practising in London. We'd grown used to a certain quality of life when I decided to expand my services to help those of the lower class. My wife didn't like the implications, for our pocketbook. I took on too many patients that couldn't pay their bills and in the end it all but bankrupted me. When she left, I closed down the practice to start anew where life was simpler. And um... here we are. Well, thank you for being here. (Water pouring) - Is that mine? - No, it's not. It's from Angus. This one is for you. "My Kirsty, I so love getting a letter and I'm so glad you're enjoying my book. "That it brings you pleasure, gives me joy. "I can't believe it's been six months. Hello, Pete. "Now for the very sad news. "We saw our first real bit of battle. And Callum fell, just feet from me. "It was over so quick. I don't think he suffered." Mack. Oh, there you are, Peter. Could do with a break. - Thatching, are you? - Aye. We're taking longer now we've not got Callum but still needs doing. - So, you got something for us. - Aye. - Argh. - Telegram. (Laughs) a telegram, now? Are they wanting the women to go fighting too. Morag, bring my glasses. What's all this fuss you're making. Oh, hello, Peter. How are you? I'm fine, thanks, Morag. I'm fine. Mack?! - God, no! - What is it? Oh, no, not my sweet Callum. Not my baby. Oh, no. Not my baby! Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, no! (Wailing) Callum Morrison's dead. Oh, dear, God! That's what I heard? Most terrible sound. (Melancholic music) Will you teach us, Peggy? Aye, I will. You gather up the rest of the girls, the supplies we'll be needing. Meet me at the store at first light. (Music continues) Annie, why don't you collect that batch for Peter? We've been making good progress these past few weeks, haven't we? It was good you came to me. And good of you, Peggy, for teaching us your ways. It was the right thing to do. It's a bit hot to be wearing an overcoat, isn't it, dear? Ma, I'm not feeling well. Erm... can I go? Aye, get yourself home, lass. Hey, Kirsty. Seems someone's missing you. Thank you, Pete. "My Kirsty, we've made it to the Somme River "and have had our fair share of battles, "but I managed to keep myself distracted by the words of our friend, Mr Frost. "But my hope comes from knowing that soon, one day, we'll be together again. "I do long for my family. "And how we all miss Callum and his songs of home. "But for me... “home is you.” “And what I wouldn't give” "for another moment alone feeling your breath against mine. "You're never far from me.” “Your spirit is always with me.” "I feel so close to the Gearrannan lads. And to God. (Muffled yell) lain! "We're all doing our very best to do our duty. (Explosion) "But with each new day, I know my mission... I'll go check on lain... "To live... to live to see another day. (Explosion) "And find my way back to you. "Yours..." “Forever...” “Murdo." (Cries) Kirsty, what are you doing? Ma sent me to look after you. Figured I'd find you, with you and Murdo... And then saw you walking up here. What are those? Answer me! Ever since Murdo left, you don't talk to me. And now after Callum, it's worse. You can't tell anyone, Annie. Especially Ma. I won't. So, that's what you've been hiding. You should have told me. Sorry. Does Murdo know? You go on. I'll make up something. Angus. Angus! My God, It's Angus. Angus, what's happened? Are you all right? (Voice quivering) Hello Mrs Macleod. Angus, what of the others? Where's Murdo? Tell me! Well... when I was hit... ...Murdo came back for me. He saved my life. And then... and then he went to help lain. I heard the whistle of a shell. All... all the other guys went out that night looking for him. So... he still... he still might be alive? (High-pitched gasp) I'm so sorry. (Sobbing) (Sobbing) (Sniffles) She's asleep. How long have you known... ...about the baby she's carrying? Your sister is pregnant and the father... ...is now dead. She only just told me today. What are we to do? If I didn't know... ...then maybe no one else does either. (Sighs) Ma. We'll get you to the mainland, Kirsty. Nobody will be any the wiser. Why? I don't... I don't understand. Kirsty, I know you're pregnant. How could you let this happen? I didn't let it happen, Ma. - Did Murdo force himself on you? - No! Of course, he didn't. I... I was... (Sobbing) I don't know who it was. What? I don't... I don't... I don't know what you mean. What are you saying? What are you saying? The night of the road dance. It was dark and... I was alone. I don't know what happened. I don't know who. I tried to stop him but he knocked me down. That's all I remember. I'm so sorry, Ma... Oh, no, no. Don't say that. You've nothing to be sorry for. You have nothing to be sorry for. Why didn't you tell me? Did you tell anyone? Who else knows? - Only the doctor... - The doctor knows... the doctor knows... Aye, but he doesn't know I'm pregnant, he just knows it happened. That's why he kept me overnight to stitch me up. Oh... sorry... You have to take me to him. Mm... No. I can't. What? Why? The whole town will know and you'll be ruined, Kirsty. I can't. No. No. What's happening, Ma? Your... your waters are broken. It... it means the baby's coming. It's coming, now. It's early. We are going to have to do this ourselves. Get blankets and lay them out on the floor. Kirsty... now listen to me. Listen to me. It's going to hurt. It's going to get a lot worse but the Lord will give you the strength that he gave me for you and your sister. What's going to happen to me and the baby? You have to help me. I'm here. I will. I'm here and I will. Mm... Ma. It's the Minister. Oh! Er... Annie, come here. Sit with your sister. Kirsty, I need you to be quiet. I need you to be quiet. Not a peep. (Quietly) Shh. Shh. I'll get you some towels, Kirsty. (Knocking on door) Minister Maclver, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming. You weren't to know Mrs Macleod, but can I come in? Certainly. This way... Uh, here, please. - I've just been with Aileen MacAulay... - Ah... I learnt about Murdo... Aye. We're all just distraught. How's Aileen? Taking it very hard, she is. It's a terrible thing, right enough, but we must still trust in God. Aye. Aye... I... I hear Kirsty and Murdo had an understanding. An understanding? Aileen thinks her Murdo and your Kirsty were very close and that I ought to check on Kirsty. Yes, they... they were close. - Might I pray with her? - She just... she needs to sleep. - Uh... - Oh... We're doing a service for Murdo and the other lads tomorrow night... Of course, and I'll tell Kirsty that you called on her. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Annie, can you help me get Kirsty down onto the floor? Come on. Take your time, we'll help. That's it... That's it. There we are. That's it, gently. Annie, can you get those pillows for me? There we go. That's it. There we are. There. Annie, can you get me some water and some rags? Listen to me. Listen. I know it hurts. This is what God made us for. It'll be all right. I promise, you'll be all right. (Heavy breathing) - (Cries) - (Mairi) Breathe and push. (Cries in agony) I'm here, Kirsty. Now, just breathe... breathe and push. That's it. - (Cries continue) - Annie, hold your sister up. That's it. That's it. Now, push! Kirsty, I can see the head. Little... little pushes. (Panting) That's it. That's it, and then a big push. Now one final big long push. - Ah...! - (Baby cries) Oh, Kirsty, it's a boy. - It's a boy. - (Kirsty crying) Annie, get me, erm... get me a bucket and some scissors. Well done. Where is he? - Give him to me. - Let me get him wrapped. Give him to me, I want to hold him! - I don't think so... - Ma, give me him. If you hold him, he will smell you and he will know you and he will think you're his mother and you will think him your son. I'm taking him. It's for the best. No, please, Ma. Please. He's my baby. Let me hold him. He's my baby. (Sobbing) Please, Ma! Please, Ma. I just want to look at him, please. Please. (Baby crying) Just for a moment. Take his head... Hold his head. That's it. - He's so small. - Mm-hm. I want to keep him, Ma. I don't want him to go. I want to keep him. Why is he so pale? Because he's two months early, lass. - No. No... - Give him to me. He's not your baby. He is my baby... You leave this house with a baby, people will think you're a whore. It wasn't my fault, Ma. It doesn't matter. Do you think Old Peggy will care? If you claim this child as your own, your life as you know it, is over. I won't let that happen to you, Kirsty. You have to trust me... - You can't take him from me! - Kirsty, you need some rest. Annie... - Kirsty, you need to get some rest. - You can't take him from me, Ma. Kirsty, stop it. Kirsty! - Please... please. - My baby! My baby! Look at me. You need to rest! OK? Ma will take care of him. I promise. (Sobbing) How is he, Ma? I don't know. He won't take the milk... at least he's sleeping. How's Kirsty? Asleep. Does he have to go, Ma? Annie, I don't even know if he's going to make it through the night. Even if he does, what choice do we have? Do you think I want this wee one to go? Holding him here and feeling his warmth, my heart already loves him. But it's best for everyone that we get him out of this village. For Kirsty's sake and for his. (Waves crashing) (Rumble of thunder) (Shuffling) - (Baby whimpers) - Shh, shh. (Quiet dramatic music) (Baby crying) (Shuffling footsteps) My sweet baby, Baby. I'll take you to the doctor. He'll know what to do. You don't have to be so quiet now. (Sobbing) (Wailing) (Rumble of thunder) - (Melancholic music) - I'm sorry. (Loud rumble of thunder) Ma? (Loud rumble of thunder and heavy patter of rain) (Rumble of thunder) Kirsty! Don't! Please! Kirsty, don't! Please, don't! I know you're sad but... My baby's dead. (Screaming) Kirsty! - (Muffled rumble) - (Loud splash) (Eerie music) Where... where is she? Annie?! - (Young Kirsty laughing) - (Voice echoes) Come on. Let's get you dry. - (Kirsty's father) What did we learn? - (Kirsty) Move our arms. - And then what? - Kick our feet. And the most important thing? Don't forget to breathe. Now, breathe. Breathe, Kirsty. (Dramatic music) I'm coming. I'm coming, Kirsty. (Anguished cry) (Frantic splashing) (Frantic voices) (Birds chirping) (Waves crashing on the shore) What do we do, Ma? There's nothing we can do, girl. But what if they find him? Maybe, we should... What? Drag your poor sister across the moor? No. I must have been possessed by the devil last night to think I could give away our own flesh and blood. Now he's gone and Kirsty's spirit is broken. No, I'll not run. We'll submit ourselves to the Lord, beg for his forgiveness. (Knocking) Constable! Might I come in, Doctor? Aye, of course. Of course. (Deep sigh) Tell me, Doctor, do you know of anyone in the village who might have just had a baby, a newborn? No. What's this about? Skipper found a newborn this morning, floating near his place. - Dear God! - Aye. Old Peg came to see me the day after the road dance. Asked me to check on Kirsty Macleod. You tended to her that night. Do you recall anything odd? Ah, bad bump on the head. I kept her that night so I could look after her stitches in the morning. - Then Murdo came to... - Murdo? Aye. Murdo MacAulay, her beau. Her beau? Hello, Annie. Is your mother in? Morning, Mairi, sorry to trouble you. I need a word with Kirsty. She's ill in bed. Why? There's been an incident. What sort of incident? A baby was found this morning, floating in the bay. Dead. Annie, go in the other room. We have reason to think Kirsty might have been with child. My Kirsty? Mairi, if I could just have a look at Kirsty. The constable could wait out here. Aye. Kirsty, the doctor's here to see you. Please... Please. Please think of her future. Kirsty. I'm not here to hurt you. Everything's going to be all right. Now, the constable is here. They found a baby near Skipper's place, a boy. Did he survive the birth? He... He was so early, he was... He would never have made it. Kirsty, I need to look at you. Whatever's happened, I need to make sure you are all right. Will you let me look at you? - Ma? - I'm here. I'm here. All right? (Rustling) You'll heal fine, in time. You just need your rest. You can trust me. I'll do my best for you. (Worried breathing) - Well, what is it? - You don't need to speak to her. Why would you say that? Because she's never had a baby. That girl has never given birth. - Thank you, Mairi. - Thank you. And you're quite certain. Get another opinion, if you like. Any doctor will say the same. You were in that damn house. Something wasn't right. It's like they were waiting for us. - And Kirsty hidden away. - She was grieving, Constable. Her young man, Murdo, has been killed. Aye... Still, something doesn't feel right. And no of fence, but I will be getting that second opinion. (Bell chimes) This came from my brother a while ago. Murdo would want her to have it. Mairi, it's done... Dr Connolly. In the Psalms, we sing of the death of the Saints being precious in the eyes of the Lord, and so it is with the boys we have lost. Their suffering is over. The pity should be for those who remain. - I killed him. - No, you didn't. You couldn't have. I shut him out. Told myself not to feel anything. I held him so tight he couldn't move. It wasn't his fault. I was his mother. Yet I killed him. Kirsty... - Why couldn't I have died too? - No, Kirsty. No. The one who should die is the one who did this to you. (Crying quietly) Dr Connolly, thank you for coming. I need to be done with the matter. Truth be told, I was to be shooting pheasant today. Never mind. And I'm sorry for your inconvenience, but now you are here. Shall we get on with it? And where is Dr Ma clean? I should like him present when I give my opinion. Pregnancy is a condition not easily misdiagnosed. (Knocking) This is Dr Connolly from Stornoway. Given the circumstances, I've asked him for a second opinion regarding Kirsty. So you want another man to look at my daughter after what she's been through? Fine, I want to be done with it. But you two are not welcome. Come. Let's get this over with, Mrs Macleod. Let me take your coat, Doctor. Oh, thank you. Could you put some hot water in a bowl for me? That and a clean towel should do. Annie, get the doctor what he needs. - Through here. - Thank you. Kirsty... there's another doctor to see you. Right. Kirsty, is it? I'm Dr Connolly. Just you do as I say and this will be over in no time. Put it there, please. Thank you. I'll just be outside, lass. Aye, aye. Right, now just relax. This might be a little uncomfortable but you'll be fine. Right, Mrs Macleod. Your constable wants a second opinion. Well, I'll give it to him. - Let me... - Oh. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. - Ah, Ma. - Annie... You fool. That girl has never been with a man, far less had a baby. - Dr Connolly... - Enough. Let that be the end of it. We still have a murdered baby. We don't know that. It might have been stillborn. I suppose I could check all the households in Gearrannan. You could, but suppose that baby's not from this village. It was a big storm. That child could have been carried a number of ways to our bay. For my part, I'm done with it. And I think you should be too. (Knocking) Kirsty, come in. Come in. Is everything all right? No. Erm... This won't take long. Since the night of the road dance, when Murdo brought me to you... Aye... I've tortured myself, thinking about the baby growing inside me, thinking... if I kill myself... and the baby, Then he'll never have to know who he is. What he is. Then we would be free. So... I did the unthinkable. The unforgivable. And now he's dead. And I'm still living. Kirsty, what you did... you weren't in your right mind. You've nothing to feel guilty for. What about you, Doctor? Have you anything to feel guilty about? I don't understand you, Kirsty. Aye, I've done things wrong and done things I wished I hadn't. No different, I suppose, to anyone in that. Aren't you? Is every sin the same then? Are they all equal? I don't... I'm just saying, you learn from your wrongs and try to right them as best you can. And what if others are ruined by what you've done? We can't dwell on these things, Kirsty. We have to forgive. Even if it means ourselves, and move on. When the constable came to my house... You whispered to me. Told me to trust you, remember? It was then that it all came back to me. It was you that defiled me. It was you that hurt me. (Quiet dramatic music) (Distant footsteps) And soon everyone will know... won't they? Kirsty, you're not making any sense. And to think, my Murdo trusted you. You're a sick, pathetic man. I'm so, so sorry. I tried to make it up to you. God may forgive you. But I never will. (Dramatic music builds) Kirsty... didn't expect to see you here. Kirsty, I need to talk to you. (Gunshot) (Shouting) Kirsty, you wait there, girl! (Dramatic music continues) Are you all right, girl? You need to come now. Please, now! Kirsty! Kirsty! - (Panting) - (Door slams) - It was him! - What? - It was the doctor! - What? What are you saying? When he came here to examine me, he whispered to me and I smelt him. I smelt the whisky on his breath, the same as the night I was on the ground. - (Banging on the door) - Open the door, Mairi... Get back. Get back. Open the door right now! I've just come from the doctor's. He's dead. He's gone and shot himself. Now why? Why would he do that? It gets me to thinking last time I was here and made to wait outside, maybe Dr Connolly checked the wrong girl. Maybe he checked you instead of you? eh?! - You tell me that's not the truth... - Kirsty's done nothing wrong. It was him. You dare come here and speak of it. Her life is ruined. Because of your daughter and her relations... Relations?! She was raped, Constable. She was raped! It was him. It was that man. (Woman) I always wondered why a doctor like that would move out here, where the sea comes to die. You have a choice, Constable. That girl did not. Come here. You did nothing wrong. My girl. It's all right. It's all right. (Emotive music) (Sheep bleating) Kirsty... are sure you want to do this? You'll be all alone. I know. It'll be hard, but I'm not afraid... Not anymore. Kirsty, can I have a word? Annie can finish. (Deep sigh) Your Da and I always knew this island wasn't going to be big enough for you. Always the one asking the questions, always wanting to know more, to see more... We knew this day would come. What I mean to say... is that I'm so proud of you... ...with everything that happened. Kirsty, I want you to know it pains me to know how I let you down. - You didn't... - No, I did. Anyway... you know that Annie and I will always be here for you. But don't you waste a precious minute thinking about us. We will be fine. (Crying) I love you so much, Ma. Oh... - (Gentle music) - (Waves crashing) It's OK. It's OK. Write to me often. You take good care of her. - I love you, Ma. - I love you. Kirsty... Kirsty, here's a wee something for the journey. Pete, thank you. - Love you. - (Quietly) Love you. Kirsty! Skipper... Thank you. (Water splashing) (Music continues) (Music builds) (Music quietens) (Knocking) I'll just be a minute, Uncle. (Voice quivering) Murdo. The Germans found me. They took me prisoner until the war was over. When I finally got back to Gearrannan... Your mother, she told me everything. (Crying) I'm so sorry. I took the first boat here... And here I am. I told you I'd find my way back. (Music fades) (Traditional Scottish violin and bagpipe music) (Music builds) (♪ "Fil O Ro", Traditional sung by Ellen MacDonald) (Violin plays with voice)
