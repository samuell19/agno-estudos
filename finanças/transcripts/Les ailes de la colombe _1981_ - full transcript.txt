- What are you doing? - Leaving. I have to be back in Paris today. My bags are still in my room. - Go back to sleep. - What's wrong? - Why so formal? - One night together... - You don't even know my name. - What should I do? Go back to sleep, it's early. Then do what you like. What did you think? Are you nuts? The Dove - The bill's been paid. - You're our guest, Marc. Let's go, we're really late. Say hello to your mother, Marc, and come back! Bye! Who was that woman in the hallway? I don't know. She'd obviously lost something. - The wind blew it away. - Wasn't she beautiful? Yes, I noticed. She was with someone until recently. Until yesterday. He was American. - He left without her. - He was her father's age. I want a real breakfast. I'll be up on the roof. I'll meet you there. Sorry about this morning. I must've been in the way. It didn't bother me. - It bothered Suzanne. - The lady who lives with you? - Yes, I'm Marie. You? - Catherine. Catherine Croy. Are you here on vacation? Yes, in a way. I'm always on vacation, aren't you? Always on vacation? I mean, are you on vacation here? Yes... no. When I'm alone, I'm on vacation. Catherine, Suzanne. I'll take a walk before it gets too hot. See you. Did you order? There's more to see here than me. I know it all by heart. - Are you from Venice? - Yes. Why did you get off here? - Because. - Because? I liked feeling your eyes behind me. But much longer and I would've got annoyed. Show me something around here. All right. All the paintings are by Veronese. This is his church. He's buried under the organ. Who's that you just waved at? All I know is her name's Marie. Do you know her? I've seen her around, often with a lady. Had you seen me before the ferry? No. Who was that boy you were talking to? My friend Eugenio. - I'm Sandro. - I'm Catherine. Ciao, Sandro, leave me alone now. Catherine! - Where's Warren? - He went back to New York. And you stayed? Good. You win some, you lose some, as they say. - Who are they? - Who? - Those 2 women. - That girl? Why, are you interested? She's staying in my hotel. She's a beautiful girl. Yes, a real young lady. Enormously rich, an orphan, all alone in the world. Except for poor Suzanne Berger, her godmother, who adores her and follows her everywhere. That's all I know. They've been here for 3 weeks, and are enjoying themselves. - Enough? - Too much. I'll just walk around. Pianist? - You're a pianist? - No. I play sometimes. I do lots of things, nothing in particular. A good-for-nothing. What's a good-for-nothing? Oh, yeah. I'm poor, if that's what it means. What do you do? Me? I make shekels fall from my dress. Marie, Suzanne, this is Sandro. You weren't alone for long. Sandro says he knows you. - Really? - It's true. I'll show you something. Come with me. You'll see that I know you. Come on! It's your portrait. She's your double. Do you say "double"? I'll never be better. Never. Better than her? Why not? She's very nice, but you're better. She's very beautiful, but her beauty isn't real. I meant that everything's been great since this morning. I've never felt better. I'm happy I met you today. I'd like to look like her. She's very pale. Even her hands look like yours. Mine are bigger. Mine are huge. No, they're small. You're better than her. But there's a resemblance. Can you see the resemblance? No, I don't know. - Where are we? - La Fenice opera house. - You write articles about her? - Her? You talk like she's a woman. I write about what goes on inside La Fenice. I write music criticism. What are shekels? What is making shekels fall? It means I'm a hooker. A call girl, understand? Yeah... But I'm through with it. I'm not getting laid for shekels anymore. But... You can box as well as playing the piano? Hankie? They would've had a good night. Take this. Why? I don't want to. Take it. It's not a good time. You're giving up your shekels... Come see me in Paris. - Where in Paris? - At the hotel. - I always live in the hotel. - When? When I tell you. I'll call you. I don't have a phone. I'm not down at the paper much. I'll send a telegram. I hate writing. Take it. You were at the bell tower earlier. - Did you see me? - No. I just know you were there. You scared me senseless. Is that what you wanted? No. I want to go back to Paris. Is that what's bothering you? Then we'll go back today. We'll get on the train tonight, OK? I guess I made you stay. I was happy here with my memories. It's my fault. Good for me. Yes, you're a tyrant. What did Dr. Pons say when you saw him alone? Who told you I saw him? Not him. Or you. This is the first time I mention it. I guessed right. I guess you're not in on the secret. He didn't have a secret. - Aren't you well? - I don't know. Might be good to find out. - Are you unhappy? - Not at all! - But I sometimes wonder... - If you're sick? No, if I have it all. Of all people, you do. For how much longer? Do you want to see a doctor? Tell me what's wrong. Maybe I'm too happy. So? Just that. Being too happy. I can hardly stand it. Who do you want to see? Pons referred me to a Professor Lukirsch. That young man with Catherine is really sweet. - I'm leaving tomorrow. - We decided to leave tonight! - You're taking the train? - Yes! Me and planes... - Come and see us soon? - I promise. Are you going to Paris, too? Not tonight or tomorrow. One day... Remember. Don't phone me or write me. I'll get hold of you. Damn! - Is that you? - Hello, Dad. - Can I turn on the light? - No way. I thought you were out of town. I got in this morning. - Feeling better? - Why would I be? You don't ask about your sister? I don't speak to her anymore. Look. We send notes to each other's rooms. Did you bring me anything? No, I'm not bringing you any more money. I'm through. Finished. You want me to believe that? What did you do with your life? Look at you! You're mad that I'm still here? Your problem is you're in love. I feel sorry for the poor guy. It'd help if you'd try to understand. No response? You don't want to? Now you're not speaking to me anymore? Why do you leave the door unlocked? Dad! I'm leaving. And I won't be back. Did you hear me? Give me the money. No, it's over. For good this time. The money. I want the money, the cash. You got the cash, give it to me! Bitch! Just give me some money! Then fuck off, you slut! Double-crosser! Whore! Quick, before Suzanne gets back. - Do me a favor tomorrow. - Sure, anything. It's a secret, but I have to be mean and hypocritical. Something nasty? I love that! It's not what you think. I want you to come with me to see Lukirsch. Who's Lukirsch? Professor Lukirsch, the famous doctor. I don't want to go alone. No one will go with me except Suzanne, who wants it too much. Great, I fall somewhere in between. What's wrong with you? Too much imagination, probably. You're fine, nothing wrong with you. Yeah, but you have to find out. You have to find out. I knew you'd help me. Not a word, huh? If you were sick, how would you hide it? You can't hide it forever. But it can go on for a while. It's an advantage. I could die and no one would know. Strange you'd talk about that here. Why here? You could have anything you want. You sound just like Suzanne. Speaking of which... Coffee! You need to come back soon. Next week. How's Monday morning? Fine. Can you come to my clinic at the hospital? - Yes. - I'll write it down. Plus the name of the intern who will do the exam. - What did he say? - Nothing to worry about. If I promise to be good, he'll take care of me. - He thinks you're sick? - Who cares? I'll find out soon. He knows everything about me, which I like. Did he ask lots of questions? No, he didn't need to. He focused his attention entirely on me. By the end, he knew everything. Like a fortune teller. When do we go back? I won't bother you again. The ice is broken. - You're going alone? - Yes, don't tell anyone. Poor Suzanne! You ask a lot for what you give. Tell her. Tell me the truth and I won't tell a soul. Tell me what you know. Yeah... Come for dinner tomorrow with Marc and his mother. - Who's Marc? - He's really nice. He really wants to meet you. - I've seen you before. - I don't think so. - In Venice. - You were there, too? I left just before Marie found you on all fours in the hallway, if Suzanne is telling the truth. Simple Suzanne never lies. Let's retire to the drawing room. So the hallway story is true... Who is this Catherine Croy? I can't figure her out. Someone Marie met in Venice. Marie adores her. She is rather marvelous, don't you think? Yes, sure. My son isn't obligated to find her marvelous. I was watching you come down the stairs. I wasn't the only one. I'm sure. Catherine had lots of admirers in Venice. Who was that young man playing the Impromptus? The what? Schubert. Don't be silly. You know what his name is. Sandro. How's Sandro? I don't know, I haven't heard from him. I doubt I will. - Where does she come from? - No idea. Go on. You saw Catherine coming down the stairs, then... Then she went to the bar and sat down on a stool. She rested her head on her hand, - and closed her eyes. - She fell asleep in the bar? No, it was only for a few minutes. - She crossed her legs. - Was it nice? Very. You have long legs. Beautiful legs. Then a young man met you, I think, and you left together. That's what I'll do again, - but alone. - Where to? Home. I'm bushed. - Can I see you again? - Sure? Call me. Where? Ask Marie, she'll tell you. - Let me give you a present! - No way. - Why not? - No presents, and that's it. I'll give you Marc, then you can't say no. Is that all? - His mother will be happy! - Good for her. I'm sick of being nice to that old bag. Suzanne adores Marc, I don't get it. What if I didn't like your present? I'd doubt it. I saw you. What? What are you thinking about? Who? Keep it if you want. No. What pretty rings. What is this stone, an emerald? - Everything's been arranged. - Thank you. You're welcome. What are you getting up to behind my back? - She gave me a present. - I'm not surprised. - The present was you. - How nice of her. She said, "I'll give you Marc." - What did you give her? - Nothing. - She didn't ask. - Do you like the present? Yes. Marie is a dove. The most beautiful dove. I'm fond of her, too. - What are you doing with her? - Nothing. My mother is obsessed with getting me married. To anyone at all? Don't you want to marry Marie? Marie doesn't want to. - Do you ever sleep with her? - Never. That's the way it is. I wish we could have avoided this exam. You're brave, but I wish you'd brought someone. I understand you're all alone? - No family? - No one. I'm a survivor. I only have Suzanne. - Suzanne? - My godmother, Suzanne Berger. She's always with me. Have you told her what we're doing? No, she knows nothing. Well... almost nothing. The other day, you were with someone. A friend. I told her. - Told her what? - I'm seeing you in secret. - She'll tell someone. - No, she's loyal. If she's loyal, then you can count on her. - It doesn't change things. - What things? My solitude. My absolute solitude. Every situation is unavoidable. - The rest... - The rest? The rest is pointless. Pointless and charming. Maybe you can do something for me. Maybe I can do something for myself. I feel really comfortable with you. It helps me. First, you have to be happy. You have to accept it and want it. I do, or I wouldn't be here. - Can you travel? - I can do what I like. My freedom knows no bounds. Take advantage of it. Get away from Paris. Then how will you see me? Unless you don't need to anymore... I won't lose track of you. If you left, would your godmother come with you? I hope Suzanne will stay with me to the end. The end of what? Everything. The end is far away. We're at the beginning. - So, traveling? - That's what I prescribe. And I want you to send me regular reports. I'd like to talk to... - Suzanne. - Yes. Whenever you want. Can I come for a visit tonight? I'll tell her to be there. You must think I'm crazy. Maybe that's all you have. - But I'll live? - That's all I ask you to do. What's wrong, dear? Nothing. Yes, tell me. I think we're going back to Venice. Why not? How did you decide that? I saw Lukirsch. I thought you'd forgotten. I saw him twice. Oh dear! What did he say? If it's serious, why did he tell me what I could do? If it's not serious... Do you know anything? He'll be here soon to talk to you. What about you? I won't be here. What's going on? Lucky I caught you alone. The opposite is unlikely. Now you know my hideaway. - So? - He says I have to leave. Go anywhere but Paris. Is that all? Yes, almost. Are you going to leave? I'll do what he tells me. Are you sick? Yes. I think so. Very. - Let's go back to Venice. - You'd come with us? - Who's us? - Suzanne and me. Of course, if you take me. Shall I call Sandro and arrange everything? Call him right away. He doesn't have a phone. I'll do it tomorrow. Can I stay at your place? I don't feel like going home. Stop crying! What's the point? I can't cry in front of her, so I'll do it now. She'd never cry. She's too proud. Pride's never stopped me from crying. - Did Lukirsch ask to see you? - Yes. He claims he needs me. For her sake? He says that she must be happy. That's what we all need. Nothing to cry over. - We have to make her happy. - By prescription? - We're going back to Venice. - I hope you take Catherine. I don't know. - You don't like Catherine? - Why would I? What's the illness she has? It's not what she thought. - He won't tell me. - But he said it's serious? He didn't have to tell me. Where's Marie? - What a lovely place! - Isn't it? Eugenio's good at finding empty palaces. He'll take care of everything. Just let him know. I get the bathroom! You can't leave without me seeing you. I'll see you, too. She needs to understand she can't have everything. She can't. She's a dove. She's a dove with a huge bank account. What's that got to do with me? Are you blind? Console her. Over what? She'll live completely, or not at all. She'll have it all, or lose it all. I don't think she'll have it all. Do you know what's wrong with her? I suspect, but I don't want to know the details. Neither does she. She hunts details like they were dangerous animals. She's modest. Ferociously modest. - And... - What else? I can't stand sickness. So you're sending me instead. Thanks. I'm not sending you instead. I want you to marry her. Can't be easy asking a dying young girl for her hand. For you, she won't be dying. She doesn't want to die, or live halfway. She'll never smell like a hospital. No one will ever know. How does this concern you and me? I'm helping you help me, by gaining time. - Time for what? - What could happen with us. She loves you, she's crazy about you. Can't you see? And afterwards, when it's over? Don't think about it. Love me. Try to love her, too. Then... Don't... Don't? Don't abandon me. Does she know about us? No, I hardly told her anything. She just accepts what you say? Exactly like me... Yes, exactly like you. You'd make a good pair. Come home with me. - No. - Why not? Because. You'll come home with me after I do what you want? That's right. Marrying an heiress doesn't work anymore. You're wrong, it's the same as always. You'll manage. I don't understand. How could you enjoy this? I can do things I don't enjoy. I don't know how you can stand it. You'll see what I can stand. Come home with me. No. Catherine's not here right now. I'm not here to see Catherine. I stayed here, it's so beautiful. I can feel the city without seeing it. I can hear it in this house, I mean this palace. I don't really need to go out anymore. I can understand. I feel the same where I live. - Where do you live? - Far from here. It's much less beautiful, but... - Would you come and visit? - Yes, just tell me when. What's it like? More humble, obviously, but nice. Covered in paper... Musical scores? Yes, on the piano. And newspapers and stuff all over the floor. Do you write? Well... It's silly, but I do the music column for the paper. I'd like to write a book of racconti, short stories, constructed like the city, with criss-crossing canals. I'd like to come to your house. Soon? Yes. I'd also like to... Strange... - What's strange? - Nothing. Asleep already? No. What are you doing in the dark? Nothing. I'm dreaming. I dreamed all day. I walked all over the place, talking to strangers. - Did you go out? - No. - I stayed here. - Did you enjoy yourself? Sandro came by. What did Sandro want? Nothing. He had breakfast here. Didn't you see him today? No, unfortunately. In Paris, you gave me Marc. If you like, I'll give you Sandro. - I won't be long. - Hurry! Well, well! You're here, for once. We're going for a walk. What about you? I'll do what you tell me to. - I'll leave. - No, I will. - Isn't this a bit much? - No. You could do anything, and she'd still trust you. You should do the same. Where is she? She could come in at any moment. She's doing it for you. She's seeing me for you. Then do what you're doing for her. I'm not afraid, Sandro. I'm only doing it for you. I'd do anything for you. - See how I love you? - Swear it. - What? - That you love me. If you don't believe me, end it. - With you? - With Marie. Leave now and I won't tell her you were here. - Don't come back. - How would you explain it? I'd say you couldn't stand her anymore. It wouldn't kill her. Gets better and better... You don't want to look that bad? I think success is just around the corner. What time is it? We've been together for 30 minutes, no more. Stop it and swear to me. There are no witnesses. You think so? I'll do what you want. I'm leaving. Tell her I had to run. She'll understand. - I don't see how. - No need to see. Lukirsch, her doctor from Paris, is here. She really wants you to meet him. Be good, for her sake. - Let's go to your place. - It's too far. Then I want to go to the Frari. All right. We'll get off the boat and go on foot. Great, we'll walk. I'd really like you to meet Lukirsch. Who's Lukirsch? My doctor. He's here. I thought you weren't sick anymore. - Did Suzanne... - No, I thought since you never went out, you must be tired or sick. I don't think so anymore. - Is Lukirsch at the palace? - No, the hotel. He doesn't have the same schedule as you. You'll see, he's a friend. I'm having a party at the palace, so you can meet him. Since you're so brave, let's go to my place. All right. Do you have any tea? I'll make you hot chocolate. I don't have any matching glasses. Careful, you'll drop it. Why are you laughing? You're so formal with me. It's Suzanne's fault. She's quite distinguished. - Wonderful! - It's true. Not Suzanne, your hot chocolate. My hot chocolate... Could I make a living making chocolate? Is it hard for you? It's hard for most people. Yes, I know. Don't get all sad. It has nothing to do with you. Do you think I know enough Italian to read you? I don't write in Italian, I write in Venetian dialect, so you can't understand. But I've known you for a long time. - This is my favorite. - Mine, too. I like it more than... - More than what? - It's a scarab. A family heirloom. I always think it prevents me from falling... Why don't you wear it? It's too small. Come here. - She's much better. - Was she worse? She's really much better. - This is great. - I'm glad you like it. Thanks to you, since you found us this place. But the music, the candles, all that is your idea. You've gone to a lot of trouble. - For her... - You'd sacrifice everything? Yes. What can I do for her? Be there, even more than you are. - Where's Lukirsch? - Over there, in the middle. Why is he here if she's feeling better? He just showed up. - So it's true. - What's true? That he's in Venice to pursue her. Silly boy! Come here for your punishment. Marie asked me to introduce you. Tell him what you think. About Marie, never! It's none of his business. You're in a mood! Here he is. Marie tells me you're the best guide around. It's not hard. I've hardly ever left Venice since I was born. I hardly know it. Would you show me around? I'm not a professional guide. But we could walk around together. Do you know Dr. Lukirsch? Shall we? How does she look tonight? She looks beautiful. She is beautiful. That dress with those pearls. Look at those pearls. Doves don't usually wear collars... - It looks great on her. - Yeah... Pearls look good on everyone. They'd suit you. Suzanne says she's doing better. - Suzanne's lying. - Why? To be nice. She's not doing better, she's doing worse. Tonight she wants to live. Why? For who? For him. She won't be able to cheat on him. You make her want to live. My love! I've never gone to so much trouble for anyone. No need for trouble between us. Everything will be yours, in time. We'll be free, in time. You and me. Yes, yes, yes. Do I have to ask her to marry me right away? Do what you can, when you can. As long as you don't abandon me. Who's abandoning who? You shouldn't ask that. Come home with me. No. You'll come home with me. No, I'm leaving. Leaving? When? In a few days, for Paris. And Marie? She's staying with you. And Suzanne, of course. You're leaving me alone? Aren't you a big boy? Suzanne says she won't die if you're there. Look! Do you think... she'd ask me to marry her? She'd give you anything you want. What I want is you, now, without paying, tonight before you leave me alone with her. Understand? I'll do what you want if you do what I want. Got it? Suzanne's coming. If you won't understand, I'll say no. I'll be ashamed and do nothing. - Nothing? - Absolutely nothing. I won't see Marie after you leave. And if I understand? Maybe I could keep going. Maybe? Then I understand. - Do you swear? - I swear. - Will you come with me? - I'll come. There's always a lot more to see. Unfortunately, I'm not here for very long. And Marie? She's in good hands. My Italian colleague... I don't know if you realize it, but she needs you the most. Marie's waiting for you upstairs. I'm going to bed. You're tired this early? No, I don't want to sleep. - Marie! - Yes? Come on! Yes? I told you not to call me. I need to talk to you. Write me. Yes. - Coming? - Yes, just a minute. - What are you doing? - Waiting for you. Does anyone else know you read the letter? No. Go to Venice and tell Marie everything. And do it fast. She turned her face to the wall. Is she doing worse? I don't know how she's doing. That's why I'm here. I feel like I've been waiting for you all this time. - Are you unhappy? - Immobile. Like a mouse. More immobile in the last 3 days than ever before. Is she about to die? - She hasn't said your name. - In 3 days? It's like you were dead. I am dead. Don't stay like that. Sit down. She turned her face to the wall. Nothing matters to her anymore. Even if you denied it. Denied what? What she heard from Marc. What did she hear? I thought you knew. No, I don't know Marc. He came from Paris for that purpose. He spoke to her for half an hour about a letter he'd read. A letter you wrote to Catherine. Marie didn't let on anything. He dealt her a blow. She absorbed it without blinking. He doesn't know what he's done to her. She talks about nothing and no one. She doesn't want to die. Think of her youth, what she has, what she is. And her calm... - She's very calm? - Beyond calm. She's resigned. It's been going on for days... - She'd kill me if she told me. - Told you what? How she feels, how she's clinging, how she doesn't want... Of course she doesn't want to die. - I came to talk about her. - Does she hate me? I don't know. No one will ever know. - She'll never say? - Never. - Should I turn on a light? - Not on my account. - Anything? - Not for me. Would she see me again? You'd like to see her again? If she could stand it. What could you do? It's too late. - The doctor? - Tacchini? He's happy the Paris specialist trusts him. - No, Lukirsch. - He'll be here in a few days. - Lukirsch likes you. - I like him, too. He told me he'd like to see the rest of the city with you. Really? Actually... - I came... - You said it was too late! - Don't abandon her. - She's abandoning me. What can I do if she won't see me? You don't want to see her? She has to want to. But she won't want to. She can't want to. Come on. I don't go to the palace anymore. Can I drop you off somewhere? No, I'm fine. Meet me at the airport tomorrow morning. I might have something to tell you. I'll be back soon. Is she better? I have a message for you. She'd like it if you went to see her. She wants me to go see her? Yes. - She can see people? - She can see you. - You'll be back? - She can't be moved. I've done my duty. See you soon. I'd like you to leave. Leave? Go to Catherine in Paris. That's what I'd like. That's what I wanted to tell you. I'd prefer not to leave. This is for you. Open it when you're far away. I had something for you. You don't have it anymore? Yes. You took a long time coming to see me. Isn't that your method? I can't see you or talk to you... Why did you come to Paris? Marie wanted me to. - About Marc... - I don't care. - You opened Marie's letter. - Isn't that why you sent it? Not so you could open it. To find out whether you would. I'm predictable. Too bad. Don't you want to know what she says? No. Nothing interests you now? I know there's lots of money. Yes, lots. She's giving you a lot. She didn't love you for nothing. You didn't love me for nothing. Remember I joked that she was a dove? She spread her wings over us, for protection. You love her. You fell in love with her. Maybe. I'm in love with a dying woman. She died. - When? - Yesterday morning. Poor Suzanne phoned me from Venice. The truth is, you're scared. You can burn the letter, but not her will. I won't accept it. Are you leaving? Yes. You know you won't see me again? Yes. What are you going to do? Don't worry, I won't do anything stupid. There are too many people left to deceive.
