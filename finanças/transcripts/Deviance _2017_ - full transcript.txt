Come on, let's get you out of here. God, come on. Ugh you smell. Come on. Here, lay down. Give me your feet. - God you look so much like her. - Lucky me. I swear I don't know I stay here and take care of you. - Where's your brother? (bell rings loudly) (indistinct chatter) (hissing) - [Narrator] Man I ain't worried bout that hoe! - Okay ladies, you've got two minutes. Let's get these showers and get out of here. Let's go, let's go! - [Narrator] Let's go. Yes sir. (loud thud) - Sorry dude. Slipped. - Yo, why are you guys always fucking with that poor kid man? - Whatever. Scared we're gonna steal your (mumbles). - Bros before mothers. - Watch this. (boy gags) (guys laugh) - What the hell's the matter with you man?! - Goodbye Milton! - It's not funny man. (solemn music) - Jesus! - Sorry! (loud knocking) - Mr. Schneider? - Can I help you? - Connor O'Reilly, I'm here about the reference. - Oh yes. - Rough time getting here? - Oh yeah, I guess you could say that. I was in your class a few years ago. - Yes I know. - Well, anyway, I'm trying to transfer some community college classes to a university in the spring and I need a reference. - Oh? - I remember really liking your class and I was hoping you could help me out-- - Travis O'Reilly's boy right? Tell me, how is your dad doing these days? - My dad? He's doing okay I guess. - Your dad and I go way back, we went to school together. - Oh cool, that's awesome. I didn't realize you two were friends-- - Your dad was really something. Big man on campus. Good looking, smart, quite the prankster too. - Right, well about the reference-- - He gave me this. I don't spend a day without it. Tell him thank you for me. - I'm sorry, I don't know what to say. He never... Okay. Mr. Schneider please, you don't understand. I need this reference. - That's right, you want my help. Funny how life works. - Yeah but that's not my fault! I'm sorry, but I am not my dad okay. I'm nothing like him. Please, just take a look at it. Help me out. - I'm sorry Connor. I've got work to do. (beeping) - Wow, you must've worked pretty hard on this. - I already told you the police academy's gonna take up most of my time okay. - Well. Did you go somewhere special today? - No. - Why'd you need my tie? What, you think I'm stupid? You think I didn't see you sneak into my room this morning and snatch it out of my closet? - Dad, he just needed it for a reference. He wanted to look nice today okay. - Oh, a reference. This wouldn't have anything to do with that fancy university you wanna go to would it? - Look dad, I really don't wanna talk about it. - Fine. Shit for brains just like your mother. - God you are such an asshole. - I told you to watch your fucking mouth! - Stop it! You are really something you know that? - You know he started it. - Hey. You just need to learn to let his crap roll off your back. He does the same shit to me. How did it go today? - Not good. (ominous music) - Sorry Connor. - Almighty Father, sanctify this food so that we may endure your will perfectly. In Jesus name we pray, amen. - [Woman And Boy] Amen. - Dad. - Yes Milton. - Well I was thinking, since it's my senior year and all that I really should be focusing in my studies. - You're not having problems with your grades are you? - No. It's basketball. I think it would be a good idea if I left the team. - Why would you wanna do that? - You don't wanna let your team down do you? - Well I'm just not that good at it. You should see the other guys and the way they play. I just get in the way. - At your age you need a hobby. - I was thinking I could join the art club. I used to draw a lot and I think that would be like-- - Art. Don't be silly Milton. - You're going to be a man now and the Lord's blessed you in many ways and-- - Well not in basketball. Sorry. - Maybe you should just go to your room and pray about it. - Your mother's right. Go on. (ominous music) - Connor. Connor. - Dad what are you doing? - Come on, sit down. Just have a beer with your old man. - Dad I'm sorry, I can't. I've got a lot of studying to do. - Well okay then. - Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So I heard you talking to Aileen on the porch. Why do you hate me so much? Why don't you just leave? - I didn't mean anything by it dad. - Of course you didn't. Because as big a fuck up as I am, you know that you'd be out on the street. You didn't have this place. You have a roof over your head. So tell me, why don't you have a girlfriend? - I don't know, I just don't. - Come on. I mean you're not a bad looking kid. Hey you ought to be out there banging all the pussy you can get. Sometimes in high school I could get any girl I want. Decent grades, a football scholarship. Look at me now. So, you think you're above me and shit going to college and everything, don't you? You're not. - Dad I don't think that. - 'Cause you are more like me than you ever wanna believe. You'll fuck it up, you'll see. You always do. (solemn music) - Well, I'm gonna go back to studying now. (rhythmic music) (ominous music) - Is something wrong? - Where you been? - I just decided to take the long way home. - Long way took you an hour. - Well actually I stayed after practice first and helping with the school's homecoming. - Really? - Yeah. - Any idea who you're taking? - Well that's good. Because your father and I have arranged a little date for you. Do you remember Sam and Terry Whitelock from church? - They have a daughter your age, Sarah? - And she's really cute. - Okay. - John C. Calhoun. - Vice president to serve under two different presidents. - Yes! Which were? - Adams and Jackson. - Yes, all right. Year McKinley was assassinated? - Hold on, - Come on. - [Connor] Hold on don't tell me. 1903? - Ah 1901. - Dammit. - Well if you flunk out, there's always flipping burgers. - Shut up. - Oh what, you're gonna make me? - I'd kick your ass man. - Oh really? I'd like to see you try. I was top wrestler in my high school. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - What? - I'm sorry, I... - What the hell was that all about? - I'll see you around. - Jason, hold up. - I'm sorry, I shouldn't have reacted that way. - No, it's okay. I've just been really messed up lately. - What's up? - My dad, they just diagnosed him with lung cancer and they found it kinda late so I've been all up in my head about that. - Hey yeah it's okay. - No I'm caught up, I'm sorry. You don't need this right now. - No, no, it's okay. - [Guy In Red Shirt] And my girlfriend just doesn't wanna talk about it. And all my friends are shit and they don't care. You're just really nice. - Hey, listen to me all right. Don't you ever apologize for anything. Just forget about all them. - Connor where did you put the... The hell is going on in here? - Dude, I told you I wasn't into guys! - Jason wait! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you, queer now?! - No. - You sick son of a bitch! - What the hell is going out here? I'm trying to study! - Your little bro's got a confession to make. Go ahead, tell her boy! Y'all are all close and shit! - What is he talking about?! - Tell her! - Would somebody please just tell me what the hell is going on? - Connor is a fag! - Connor you're gay? - Aileen no, I swear it's not like that I-- - What is it huh? What is it, what are you confused?! - No! - Dad, just stop it! - What's next Connor? What, are you gonna be wearing Aileen's panties!? You little pervert! - Can we just talk about this like a normal family?! It's not a big deal! - You shut up! - Hey you stop it! - Get your shit. You take yourself and you take your sickness and you get the fuck out of my house! - Connor don't! Dad! You can't be serious. What the hell is wrong with you?! Connor don't go. - You heard him. - He doesn't know what he's saying! He's drunk half the time! - Let's just cut the shit all right. He hates me, he always has. You know, maybe this is for the best. I love you. - No! Connor! Connor wait! Please don't go! Connor! - These dolls are so freaky. - Don't. Sorry, but my mom doesn't even let me touch them so. - Well I would hope not. So. How long are your parents gonna be gone? - Well, they'll be home late I guess. - I think you'd look better without your glasses. - Really? - See. - No I can't. - Well, since your parents are gone, did you wanna? - What? - Did you wanna do it? - You mean have sex? No thanks. - Come here. Did you like that? - I don't know. Sarah what are you doing? - Just relax. It's okay, it's okay. - I said don't. (ominous music) - Ow! What the fuck is your problem?! - Sorry. - That fucking hurt. - Let me help you okay. - Get the fuck away from me you freak! Ugh. (heavy breathing) (Milton moans) (slow piano solo) - I have been searching for him for hours. - I told you you weren't gonna find him. - Well then I'll just file a missing persons report tomorrow at work. - Your brother is a grown ass man. It is not like he is some kid running around out there without a mommy and daddy. - You're not the least bit worried about him? - We all make our choices. Connor made his. - He's your son! ♫ Give into all (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hi, what's up? - Hey who is this? - Milton. - Hey what's up Milton? - I hope you don't mind me calling but I overheard Schneider busting your balls today in class. - Yeah the guy's a real dick. - Anyway, I know we got that big test coming up and I can help you pass it. - How's that? - Just trust me. - I'll be at your house 4:30 in the morning. - I don't know man. - I'm a master of Shakespeare I swear. ♫ We burn - All right man, let me give you my address. - No I already know it. - You already know it? - I mean, I know you live close to the school but, a street and house number would help. (faint thuds) (loud banging) - Hey, what's up dude? - I made some coffee in case we wanted to pull an all nighter. - You know what yeah, just come on in. (rock music) ♫ Babe ♫ Tell me when it all went down ♫ Time is waiting on a ♫ I'll leave it alone ♫ Babe - Hey. - Hi. - I haven't seen you around here before. Hungry. - Could you please just leave me alone? - What's the matter? Am I good enough for you? - I didn't say that. I'm just having a bad day that's all. - Well, how about I cheer you up? Whoa big guy. Hey it's tough out there. Think about it. You help me and I, I help you. You gonna get undressed? - What are you gonna do? - Well it's simple. Just think that I'm your boss. And I'm gonna ask you to do a couple things. And then I reward you. - I've never done it before. - It'll be fine. - Dude, you're a beast man. I mean, fucking Schneider's gonna drop dead when sees my grade. - We can only hope. (both laugh) - You know, you're not bad Milton. - Thanks. What is it? - It's just that I'm sorry man. I'm sorry for the way my friends treat you at school man. - Why are you sorry? You're not responsible for their actions. - Yeah, I know. - She's pretty. - Yeah, guess I didn't do too bad. - Is she the only girlfriend you've ever had? - Nah, but she's the longest. - I bet a lot of girls wanna be with you huh? - Maybe, I mean, I don't know. Probably not. - Are you kidding me? I mean look at you, you're like Adonis. - Who? - Adonis, a Greek God of beauty. - Thanks I guess. - I'm sure even some guys would wanna be with you. - Huh? I'm sure even some guys would wanna be with you. - I don't think so man. (ominous music) Jesus man, you sure this isn't decaf? - Would you ever go with a guy? - What? - Would you ever go with a guy? How do you know? - How do I know what? - That you would ever go with a guy. - Because dude, I just know. I'm not into dick. - But you've never even tried it. - Look Milton, you're a cool guy and all-- - Well let me just present you with a hypothetical scenario. If you had to have sex with a fat ugly girl or with a guy who looked like a movie star, who would you choose? - What are you talking... (ominous music) (loud thud) - [Big Man] Get out. (ominous music) (loud bell rings) - Have you heard from Derek today? - You haven't heard from him either? - He wasn't in algebra today. - Wasn't he going to that party on River Drive? - [Narrator] No, he said he had that-- - Milton, Mr. Valentine wants to see you. - Me? - What?! The name is still Milton isn't it? (laughter) - It's none of your business but yes. And it doesn't matter, because he doesn't know where I keep the pills. - Well Derek's parents are certain that Milton drugged their son. - That's ridiculous. - If they didn't find him when they did he could of died. And you are very lucky that the parents decided not to press charges. Milton will you give us a few minutes please? Mrs. Mason, I am expelling your son. - But the boy is going to be fine. And you said they aren't pressing charges! - Either way I do not want your son in my school. - But he's a good boy. - Are you aware that a stolen copy of the English exam was found in Derek's room? - What are you saying? That Milton's a thief now? - Mrs. Mason, I think that it's time for you to seek out professional help. Therapy, counseling. - I'm afraid that is out of the question Mr. Valentine. This is a family matter. And you could be sure that Mr. Mason and I will deal with our son. (ominous music) - I have something to eat? Please? - You'll eat when I feel as if you've made progress. - With what? - Leviticus 20:13. "If a man also lie with man kind "as he lieth with a woman, (Milton sobs) "both of them have committed an abomination. "They shall surely be put to death. "Their blood"-- - Mom please! - Do not interrupt Milton! You believe in God? - Of course. - And do you believe that our Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins? - Yes. - Then you better believe this. Look. It's plain as day. Is this what you want? Sin is sin Milton. Look what this sickness inside you has caused you to commit! (solemn music) (clanking) - What are you doing out here? (loud gunshots) - I know he's in there. Waiting for me. I go over to him. Touch his skin. He looks so peaceful. - And what happens next? - I start to cry because I know once he wakes up he's going to leave me. He starts to wake up. - What happens next? (ominous music) (moaning) Milton, what happens next? Milton. - Nothing, I let him go back home. - You do? - Yes. - Well, that's an improvement over the last dream you told me. What about your parents? Have you had any dreams about them recently? - No. - Are you sure? - I'm over it. - You never get over it Milton. You just learn how to deal with it better. (ringing) - Yes sir. I'll have it to you by 2 o'clock I promise. Okay, bye bye. Hey. - Feeling kind? - You know, I'm beginning to wonder why I even learn to shoot a gun. - It's all about paying dues. - I've been paying dues for five years D'Angelo. - How 'bout this. You let me take you out for dinner and I'll see if you would help me on my next case. - Anthony, I already told you I'm seeing someone. - Oh come on, let's see a picture of this guy. - You know, I have a lot of work to do. And I'm pretty sure that you do to. - Right. (slow eerie music) - [Narrator] Hey Aileen it's Matt. I really didn't wanna do this over the phone, much less on your answering machine but, it's just not working out. I don't know what to say except I'm sorry. You're a great girl, don't get me wrong but, I'm just not feeling it, I'm sorry. (creaking) - Connor! - [Connor] Hey. - Hi, what are you doing here? - I came to see you. - Really? - I'm sorry, I know it's been a while. - Try eight months and you lost more weight. - Yeah well, one meal a day seems to do me just fine. - Oh don't be ridiculous. Here, eat my spaghetti. - Thank you it looks good. - So, are you still, you know? - Hooking? You can say it. - Well, are you? - Yeah I guess. - You guess? - Look, it's my job. - Wow, you must have one hell of a 401K plan. - Jesus Aileen, I didn't come here to get made fun of. - Hey, I'm just trying to look out for you. You haven't seen some of the girls they bring into the station! - Well I can take care of myself. - And I'm sure they said the same thing. Connor why don't you just stay with me? I've got enough room and you don't have to pay any rent. Not until you get a job that is. - I already told you I have a job. - A real job Connor. - What, flipping burgers at my age? Yeah that sounds so appealing. - Oh and sucking some old guys cock is? - Jesus! Can we just not talk about this? - Okay. Since you're here I might as well tell you. Dad died. - What? - A massive heart attack about three months ago. - My God. You think mom knows? - I have no idea. There wasn't even a funeral. (ominous music) (heavy breathing) (indistinct yelling) - You see it! (Milton screaming) Do you see it! Look! You look him in the eye right now! You see it! (Milton sobs) - Stop! - Connor? Oh. - You're really good. - Thanks. - Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I just... I'm staying at the house across the street for a couple of weeks. - Oh with Marsha? - Yeah, she's my aunt. - Oh cool! Well I'm Jason. - Milton. Anyway, I saw you playing and I used to play in high school. - Cool you wanna play? - Sure. (grunting) Junior varsity. - You think. - I guess I was never very athletic. - That's okay man, I was never really smart. - What do you mean? - I don't know. Some people you can just tell. - So, what is there to do around here for fun? - Not much man, just fucking around you know? - With girls. - No with guys. - Have you ever been with a guy? - No. - If you have it's okay to admit it you know? - What the fuck are you getting at dude? - I wasn't... - Look, maybe you should just leave okay? - Why don't we go back to my house? My aunt Mary won't be back for a little bit so-- - Mary huh? - I mean, just don't go, just give me a chance. (loud thud) (ominous music) - Fuck off! (Milton screams loudly) - So what kind of doctor are you? - Pediatrician. - Oh nice. I've always wanted to work with kids. Maybe be a school teacher or something like that. - Yeah. - Well maybe you'd like to hang out some time? - Listen sure, I'm in a bit of a hurry. How much do I owe you? - 60. No, I said 60. - Sorry about that, I forgot to bring more cash. - What are you doing? - Hey man, I thought I saw a cockroach or something crawling on your coat. These shitty motels are so dirty you know. - Where is it? - What? - My money, you took my money. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Give it back Connor! - I don't have it. Get your hands off me! - I'm not playing with you, fucking whore. Give me my money back! - Get off me. - You don't mess with people like this Connor. (loud crash) (ominous music) (loud thuds) - [Narrator] Hey dude, thanks for showing me around. - [Milton] No problem. So do you think you're gonna like it around here? - Probably not. Tons more shit to do in California. Hey, about a beer? This is boring. Wanna get high? - I don't smoke. So do you have a girlfriend? - Nope. - What about a boyfriend? - Oh yeah. Dude what the hell! - I'm sorry. - Don't. (eerie music) Get off me! (loud crash) (buzzing) (ominous music) - Guess who just got assigned a new missing persons case? - Congratulations Anthony. - And guess who's gonna work with me on this case? - Are you serious? - His name is Billy Wyatt. 22 years old, just moved here from California to live with his mother. - How long has he been missing? - Almost two days. - Okay well, where do we begin? - We begin at his mother's house. Try to get as much information as possible. - Okay that sounds great. - So, now that I'll be getting you out of this office, how about you take me up on that dinner offer? - You're sweet Anthony but, I don't think so. Is there any reason why Billy would just leave? - He never got along with his father so we decided to have him live with us for a while. - He's a good kid. I was gonna hire him in the store this summer. - Hmm. (Billy moaning) - Help, help! Help me! (Billy grunting) (ominous music) - Shhh. (buzzing) (clanking) - Hi, can I help you? - Yes, I'm Officer Aileen O'Reilly. There's been a missing persons report in the neighborhood and I was hoping to ask you a few questions. - Me? - Yes, I'm questioning everybody in the neighborhood. Have you seen this kid, Billy Wyatt, new to the neighborhood? You sure about that? - Yes. - Okay well do you mind if I talk to you-- - Listen I really wish I could help you but, I'm not feeling well. Sorry. Yes, I'd like to leave a message for Dr. Carter. Please tell her that Milton Mason called and that I need to cancel our appointment. No, no need to reschedule. Thank you. - My bet is that the kid took off for an all week party. - An all week party, really? - Kids these days party hard. (Aileen laughs) - You guys are gonna love me for this one. - Well this guy looks like a creep. - Let me see it. A missing creep. Donny Allen. His girlfriend said he went to go to the store Tuesday morning and didn't come back. And here's the kicker. She found tapes in his sock drawer. Tapes of him getting a little too friendly with her two kids. - Oh geez. - Why would the girlfriend even want him back? - To cut his dick off. Well, I'll be in my office if you need me. - What the hell is going on around here? - The crazies are coming out. - You think there's any relation between this Donny guy and Billy? - Doubt it, but why don't you see what you can find out on this guy. - Connor, what are you doing here? You scared me. Work's been crazy. I'm actually working on two cases believe it or not. - Wait, you're working on this? - Yeah, but you really shouldn't be looking at my stuff though. - Well have you found anything out about him? - Why are you so curious about this guy? - Nothing. - Connor what is going on? - I came here today because I wanted to tell you goodbye. - Wait, what are you talking about? - I'm leaving. - Leaving?! - I can't be here anymore. - Well why not Connor? What is going on? - It's nothing. - I practically raised you, I know when something is wrong with you. - Will you stop making this harder than it already is? I already told you I can't be here and I thought if I came here to tell you goodbye you'd appreciate it but obviously not! - Connor wait, wait! Hey, you left me once before and I'm not gonna have you leave me again. Now you tell me what is wrong. Oh God Connor, what have you done? - I love you all right. - Connor-- - Would you just stop it! Sorry. Hey man, thanks for picking me up. - You're welcome. You all right there buddy? - Yeah, rough night that's all. - I'm Milton. - Connor. - It's a pleasure Connor. - Yeah. - Would you like to stop for something to eat? - Yeah I guess I could go for a quick bite. Hey, thanks for the food Milton. I was getting a little light headed there. - It's no problem. So where are you headed? - Don't know, can't stay here though. - Why is that? - You know, I'm just bored with it that's all. - Are you in some sort of trouble? - What makes you say that? Well it's gonna get dark out here soon, do you mind driving me a few more miles 'til we get out of town? - You can stay at my house for the night. - What? - Well I have plenty of room, and that way you can get a good night sleep and I can drive you out of town in the morning after breakfast. - I don't know man. I don't wanna cause you any trouble. - You're no trouble Connor. You can trust me. - How 'bout picking up a bit huh? Are we almost there? - Just a few more minutes. (ringing) - Yeah what? I'm on my way. - It's okay. You okay? - Yeah. Nice place you got here Milton. But why do you sleep in the basement? - Oh this isn't really my house. It's my parents. I had it before they passed away. - Oh wow. I'm sorry man. - Just the thought of sleeping in their room kind of creeps me out. - Yeah no kidding. Holy shit dude, I used have one just like this when I was a kid! - Did you? - Yeah. But then my dad took it away from me and threw it in the trash. He said it was gonna make me go soft. - Sounds like your dad was tough on you. - Yup. Fucker didn't allow shit like that. - Do you want a drink? - Yeah. Sure. - Okay. - I'm totally serious man. And this guy had the worst breath too. You know, he didn't even pay me at the end of the night? - All that hard work for nothing. - Oh yeah, I work real hard. - How did you get into all that by the way? - Well you know, med school didn't work out so I figured, hey this is the next best option. - Connor, I'm serious. - I don't know. I was never really good at anything. Some people ar born with smarts and talents and all that good stuff. And some people are just born with shit for brains. - I don't think that's true. You can make something of yourself if you wanted to. - Yeah try telling that to everyone else. - You got a lot to offer. And you're handsome. - Yeah right. - I mean it. Stay with me. - Huh? - Promise me you won't leave. - I'm sorry man this is a mistake. (Milton stutters) - What do you mean? - I can't go into it but, I gotta get out of here. Milton stop it. (Milton giggles) Milton. I said stop it! Look, I like you. And I appreciate everything you've done for me, I really do. But I can't get involved with you all right. I gotta get the fuck out of here! - If there's something wrong, you can tell me. - No I can't, you wouldn't understand. - I can help you. Whatever you want. Whatever you need, just let me! - I'm sorry, but if you wanna help me then just leave me alone. (Milton screams) (ominous music) (Connor gags) - Shh. (Milton giggles) - Come on! (ominous music) (Connor breathes heavy) (Connor gasps) (clanking) (loud thud) (faint banging) - Come out Connor, let's talk about this. I know you're here. (Connor grunts) (suspenseful music) (Milton groans) - Connor! - I killed him. - It was self defense Connor. - No, you don't understand. I killed a man. I hit him in the head and I killed him. - Connor wait, don't say anything else. - His name was Donny Allen. He was a pediatrician. I'm sorry. - Connor place your hands on the table in front of you. Connor O'Reilly, you're being placed under arrest for the murder of Donny Allen. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say or do can and will be... (creaking) Hey. - Hi. - You doing okay? Never mind, stupid question. - What's gonna happen to him? - Well he's gonna have to be tried. And he'll serve some time. But with good behavior, given the circumstances, he could be out in a few years. - Thank you Anthony for everything, really. - I didn't do anything. Hey, let's get out of here huh? Let's go get some breakfast. (Aileen sighs heavily) Just as friends. It's fine. - Anthony. I'll be out in a minute okay. - I mean how could he just disappear like that? - Don't know. The cops said he went down and found that he turned his basement into a crazy ass gay man torture chamber. - Dude that's wild. - Makes you what he did to you that night. - Dude shut up. Dude, it's not even funny. (loud bang) - Hey what was that? - That's probably just Angel messing around. - No way dude, your cat never comes down here. Uh oh. Maybe it's scary Milton, coming back to finish what he started! - Shut up man. You're an idiot. (faint yelling) You're such a douche man. Yo, are you gonna come out? Yo. Seriously? Paul. Paul! (slow paced music)
