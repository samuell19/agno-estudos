No thanks. Oh boy, what a great day to have good eyesight. You better lay off these gold digging dames, Hanson. The last time I was in this port, I had to leave my IOUs. You got off easy. I had to leave me BVDs. Here, here. Hey. You see those big brown eyes? Boy, I bet there'll be tub fulls when I leave town. There you go. You and Don Juan. A girl in every port. You meet a quart of port in every gal. He's got to get them half plastered before they'd even say maybe. Oh yeah? Well no one ever walked home on me yet. No. They ran. Hello Judy. Put that down in the books, Scrubby. Do you think it's on the level? Come here baby. Sure, I'll buy a doll. A sailor for me-- there it is. And a beautiful Chinese girl for you. How about a kiss for the both of us? What a hot welcome you got-- like Christmas Eve in Alaska. You sure handed her your collection. Oh yeah? Well, you're so smart. Say, I've got 10 bucks here that says I can get that flower she's wearing in 10 minutes. Yeah? I got 10 bucks here to say that she's got more sense. Ah, the dame is practically dumb. She can't speak English. Oh, now listen Scrubby. You love, maybe, all them words. But to me it's in action. Now watch. Hey, Judy. Maybe she thought you said cootie. Hey, uh-- English? No? Well, I Chinese to you. You and me-- we chop suey through the park. We chow mein. Mm. Yes? Hong Kong? Ping pong? What do you say? Pfft. Pull in your horse. --all in your angle, buddy. --bar job. Wait a minute. Watch me change me tactic. Good luck on your short line. Say baby, how do you say, give me a little kiss in Chinese? Scram. Scram? Hey, that's funny. That's got a different meaning in my country. Same meaning over here. Scram. It's a long way down to-- Hey, whatever. Sit down, boy. Oh well. What's the difference? The dame's probably got bow legs anyway? Oh yeah? Is that so, you big Bozo? Bow legs, huh? Listen to me. So you do talk English. I didn't grow up by the Brooklyn Navy Yard for nothing. Hey, wait a minute. Put it there. OK, pal. Say, you and me ought to get together. I sing you a Wishy Wishy Washy Love Song. And if he sings a love song and we'll be wishy washy. He may be wishy, but never washy. You can. And you can walk and even talk. Still I hope and wonder if you're real. I have tried to prove that what I do, I do for you. But you don't seem to know the way I feel. Open up those eyes. Don't be so blind to me. Can't you realize you're so unkind to me. Truly I adore you. I'm just living for you. Why must I implore you this way? Open up those eyes. Try to believe in me. It is a surprise that your heart Why won't you awaken? My love should be taken. Close the past and open arms-- So tell me, big boy, what have the other boys been doing while all the girls in the world have been falling in love with you? Oh, I don't know. You don't like yourself much, do you? No, not a bit. But what's my opinion against so many others? Hey baby, how about giving me the posy? Oh, that's for the boy I love. Well? Well. Oh, now don't say no, baby. How could I? I never saw your honey. I guess that she got old. But no one ever told me what sailors know. They don't go in for knowledge. They haven't any dough. They never went to college, but oh. they come. But I'm not that kind of dumb. That means love, How can a girl say no? As some say, But they'll never fool this dame. That means love, how can a girl say no? It's the same phrase, burning flames raise to me any place in this world I find. It a nice phrase, say it twice oh gee. I could lose all my reason and mind. Some day it's warm outside. Let's go out and take a ride. But that means love. How can a girl say no. I've got a a boy from Maine. That means love. How can a girl say no? A from Japan-- A ruby from Hindustahn. But that means love. How can a girl say no? In Sandusky there's a husky old boy who has asked me to come around. And in are the me to back to the old camping ground. Some perfume from Paris But that means love, how can a girl say no? Come on baby. Hand over the flower. You sure you want it? Sure I want it. OK. Take it. Open up those eyes. How can I-- Don't be so blind to me. Can't you realize-- I should hate you. You're so unkind to me. Truly, I adore you. I'm just living for you. Why must I implore you this way. I love you. Oh-- Open up those eyes. --how can I-- Try to believe in me. It is a surprise. Why won't you awaken? My love should be taken. Close the past and open arms Just a gigolo.
