Yes, thank you very much. They're coming by to get a description. - Oh, they're sickening. I'm walking and they riding around like they're TV cops. Car 41, where are you? - [Sweets] Yeah, that's a damn good question. Where the hell are you? - What was that police's telephone number? Now in my dream book, the grocery store is 789. - Mama, you know you really are something. Here you are all battered and bruised and you sitting here thinking about the numbers. - Well I may as well get something out of it. - Come here, Benjie. - Grandma. - Oh don't be scared, son. It's all over. - What happened? - Boys. Dirty thugs. Wasn't enough for them just to take her pocketbook. They had to beat her up, too. - And the police want a description. I'll give 'em one. Two young able bodied black boys. That's who did it. - I'm sorry, grandma. - Oh, that's all right. - Would you tell me why it is, by the way, that you come in here three hours late everyday from school? - Hey. - Bugs, they mugged my mother. Look at her. - You all right? - Let me tell you something. You come in this house right after school. Do you hear me? - Wanna see a doctor? - She's more upset than I am. - I didn't do nothing. - [Butler] Well, what happened? - [Mrs. Bell] Well, these two boys just grabbed me, my pocketbook, and everything. - I'm so sorry, Benjie. - [Butler] You sure you don't wanna see a doctor? - Go get washed up. - It's all right. I'll be all right. What's in your box? - Oh. Oh, that's just my new suit. Just got it out the layaway. - [Mrs. Bell] Yeah, let me see. - Sweets trying to drag me to some dance or something. - [Mrs. Bell] Yeah well, you may as well buy yourself something before they snatch your money. - Oh, speaking about money. I bought and sent off the money order for the gas and electric and that third one there is your premium on your life insurance policy. - Oh, thank you. I know I better keep that paid up. - Well. What do you think, huh? - Well. Marked down from $300. - Well, that's what they say. Miss Bell, you know I want you to try to stay at home. I don't want you going in the streets by yourself. ♪ I'm so glad trouble don't always last ♪ ♪ Oh my Lord, oh my Lord ♪ - If Rose's legal husband had only treated her half as good as you do. (throat clearing) Oh, and that hymn don't go like that no how. ♪ I'm so glad trouble don't last always ♪ ♪ Oh my Lord ♪ - Talk to Benjie for me. ♪ What shall I do ♪ - Oh yeah, that is the way it goes, ain't it? All right. Will you hang this up for me and I'll go talk to your little boy? - God is still good, ain't he? - Yes, ma'am. - Hey, Benjie. - Wanna play? - [Butler] You wanna talk? - Talk never hurt nobody. - All right. - Wild card stud. - Remember that time when I bought us those tickets to the baseball game? - Me and Jimmy Lee had us something to do. - Yeah, you always too busy to be friends so. - I just say play cards. Bet you the silver eagle I can tonka 21 you out of a quarter. One flip for high card or low. Name your game, Butler. Choose your weapon. Let me put a whipping on you. A good beating. - All right. There's your quarter, but just leave it right there 'cause that's just for having a fast mouth. Now, I'm gonna show you a little game that you've never played before. - Yeah. - Mm hm. Yeah, now. That's Sweets. Rosie. - My mama. - And that's you. And that's the- - Butler's the king. - No. That king is your daddy, but he split the scene, so we just put him over here. - Don't nobody know that. He might be somewhere sick. - That's a bunch of jive, man. He is in fine, good health. I mean three years ago, he picked up his hat and sweat and just left. Did that 'cause that's what he wanted to do, so we'll just leave him over there. - Could be. - Now, in this game there's no aces, no kings, and no numbers. This just about two jackasses and a lady. - Yeah? - Uh huh. Now you know in a deck there's only one queen of clubs and one jack of clubs. So there's gonna be another jack. He's got to be an outsider, so I will be that outsider. - You the outside spade. - So this game, Benjie, is about two jacks getting to know each other, just facing each other. We oughta be friends. Would you just try to stand me? - I'm standing you. I'm standing you everyday. You and the split king, the ace and the queen. Nobody knows how hard I be trying. - Enough card playing for one day. - [Benjie] How come you gotta say my father don't like me? - I didn't say that. - You said he's alive and well and gone and don't wanna come nowhere near me. - Benjie, that is between him and her. That has nothing at all to do with you. - Yeah, was him and her. Now it's her and you. I ain't in it. (soft music) But anyhow. I'll be glad to go with you to a baseball or a movie just as one jack to another. - That's fine with me, Jack. (soft music) I'll take care of your Mr. Benjie. I love you. I'm your fool. - I love you. - And I love everything you touch, everything you been near. - Does that include Benjie? - Mm hm. Loving him is a part of loving you 'cause sometimes you know I wish we could be together, but just good God. - Sh, sh. - Nobody else around. (soft music) - Jambo. - [Students] Jambo. - Good morning. - [Students] Good morning, Nigeria Green. - My brother, beat out a news bulletin on that drum for me. - [Boy] Go, baby.

That's my boy, you know (laughs). Oh yeah. Yeah, wow. We got nothing but great people in here. Nothing but. Okay, let's get down to serious business now. (kids laughing) We all know that George Washington was a slave holder, but he was also. - [Students] First president of the United States. - Also the father of this country. - Is that right? Oh George is the father? He sure got around, didn't he? (kids laughing) All right, and Fredrick Douglas. Now he was a slave abolitionist and. - Publisher of a newspaper Freedom Journal. - Okay, okay, okay. - El Hajj Malik. Malcolm X, minister and teacher. - Assassinated. - Yeah. They assassinated him.

Smile, you come from a royal family of the big continent Africa, the second largest continent in the whole world. Yeah, land of birds and bees and bamboo trees. Good things to eat. Yeah, yeah. All right. And good things to eat like yum plantain and rice and peas. You a young prince, man. A prince. We are all descendants of kings. Kings and queens. Look at her. Ain't she something? Look at her. That's right. What's the matter, Benjamin? - We came from kings and queens? - That's right. - How come we ain't got any kings and queens right now? - Oh boy, you always trying to be heavier than anybody else. (drum beating) - The history people. They did their thing then they died or they got run out of town or killed. Where's the now people to do things now? We always talking about what's been, never what is. What the people gonna do? - Mm. (drum beating) - I'll think about it. Okay. (bell ringing) (kids chattering) - Mr. Charlie, how come you give me 62 on the test? You couldn't find three more points? Damn. - Because that's what you made. My name is Cohen. I resent that Mr. Charlie. - Take it to the court. Fight for your civil rights like anyone else has to do. - When you leave my class, you may become president, or end in federal prison or do both, but you will know how to read. (kids chattering) Benjamin, I'd like you to read your composition please. (bell ringing) - I don't wanna read it. - Read it, Benjamin. - Somebody in my family by Benjamin Johnson. - I can't hear you, Benjamin. - Somebody in my family by Benjamin Johnson. My mother is slender. Not tall or short but in between. - [Students] Mm. - I don't like her temper. She smiles and says don't do that and she says it over and over real cool. Then all of a sudden she might be slamming pots and pans. She has a smooth face, smooth cheeks, and a dimple. One day my grandmother said we got some Indian in us from way back in our family. My mother laughed, showed her dimple, and said and a whole lot of African. (kids laughing) She is always kind and cool, except when very mad. My mother is a lady. - [Girl] Mm. Oh brother, yes. (bell ringing) - You get an A for that, Benjamin. You know, Benjamin. You could be a writer someday if you wanted to be. Could become somebody. Benjamin. What are you thinking? - I'm somebody right now. - [Students] Right. (soft music) - Come on. (bright music) Hey what's up, Carwell? (bright music) Man. (bright music) Forget it. - Oh, come on now. (bright music) - [Benjie] How you doing, Carwell? - All right. Okay. Hey, you want some? - Thanks. - [Carwell] Take care, all right. - You looking good, man. - I'ma be a basketball player. You be the writer. - Yeah, you gonna get all the big money though. - What that Carwell want? - You know, he was just hustling. Doing his thing. - Yeah, I know. - Let's go, man. - [Jimmy Lee] Oh yeah, you know like Cohen say. Some day you grow up to be a big black poet. - [Benjie] Man, I wouldn't mind reading something about Butler Craig. Oh, I could really rip him off (laughs). - I mean, but why you wanna rip off your own step? I mean, you know, he's bringing you things home y'all need. Colored TVs. - And bugging me with those heart to heart talks. - Well, the man's entitled to say something. - And he says it, Jack. Telling you, man. See look, you my boon so I tell you. I don't want him getting too close to me because then when he leaves, I won't miss him. Man, if a real father can cut out, what do you think a step will do? - Yeah. You got a point there. - Man, I promised Carwell I'd meet him at that place called Tigers. You know, where the action is, man. Let's go check it out. - No, don't go. I mean, it might be a bad scene. - Everybody's telling me what to do and how to be. Now you right along with the rest of 'em. - All right, okay. I'm sorry. I'm your boon, remember? Boon friends help each other, right? - Well, let's go to Tigers. I'm tired of being on a downer. You coming or not? Forget you, man. (soft music) - Benjie, wait up. (soft music) - Well, all right. You ain't the worst person in the world. - All right. (upbeat music) - Hey, Carwell. What's up? - Hey, I thought you said a place with low lights. - Hey man, it's cool. - Good music. What is this? Barbershop. - Hey, man. Hey. - [Carwell] Come on. - Come on. - Come on. (bright music) Hi. Hey, Tiger. These the dudes I told you about. Jimmy Lee Green. Benjie Johnson. - Hey, what's happening? How y'all doing? Okay. What's happening, B? That's me. I'm a tiger. Tiger's my name. Hey, don't burn my fine inlay coffee table, man. Y'all make yourself at home. Get in shape. Have a ball. - [Jimmy Lee] Got any wine? - Hell no, man. That shit will rot your stomach line, but I'll stone you to the bone. There's hotdogs and rolls over here in the kitchen. Same price as eating at the funky golden arches, right? This is your home away from home. - Sure one fine looking place. - Did y'all wanna buy a little something? - Me and Benjie might split a joint. Okay? - Don't waste y'all money on jive time herb. Shit make me burn up my strawberry incense trying to keep down the smell. Tell you something, fellas. What's happening now is a little skin powder. $2. (upbeat music) - Me and Benjie, we just smoke sometime off and on. - Yeah. He can't talk? (upbeat music) - I'd gladly take a light pop. That only got me 75 cents. - We gon' call you chicken ass, my man. Give the man a free go on the house. (upbeat music) - Come on, let's go. Come on, Benjie, we got basketball. - Nah, you got basketball. - I said come on, let's go. - Hey, hey, man. None of that rough shit in here. - I'm going, Benjie. - Yeah, well let me tell you something. Name of this club is shut your mouth and never tell or else. You got it? - He don't talk. - I'm going, Benjie. - Yeah, well you can just get the fuck out of here before I get mad. (upbeat music) - Drag, man. A natural drag. He gon' try it next time. - Yeah, well just watch who you trust from now on, Carwell. All right? Give this man a light touch. Don't want no amateurs to OD on us. (upbeat music) - Pump your fist. Just relax. It's gon' be okay. Just wanna get a vein so you can feel good all over. (upbeat music) Just relax. - This man's got style. Class. Front runner. (upbeat music) - It's gon' be okay. Just relax. (upbeat music) You Ben now. Big bad Ben. Might make you puke, but it'll pass. Don't worry. - Sometime life be that way. - Damn, baby. He all right. (upbeat music) - Big bad Ben. (upbeat music) (soft music) - [Sweets] Benjie. - [Butler] Come here, Benjie. Boy, where have you been? - Listening to Jimmy Lee's father talk about school busing in neighborhood concepts. - Well I have to get up at five o'clock in the morning and you think getting after you is my favorite way to spend my time? - No. I know it's not your favorite. Can I have a sandwich? - [Butler] We've already had supper. - I'll get your sandwich, Benjie. - Wait a minute. And I said we already had supper. Come here, Benjie. Benjie. Listen and learn. I mean, there's all kinds of opportunities for you these days. - When they gon' have some for you? - Yeah when? Well when you getting on in age, the world just wants you to drop dead. Just stop breathing. Tough times made me put down this horn. One week you got a gig and the next week nothing and soon you jamming for free just to keep that good sound cooking. Man, you are broke, broke, broke. - Yes, sir. I promise not to be a musician. - That's not what I mean. I had to get a steady job or else rob somebody or rip off the people or hustle some woman. Okay, so I'm a maintenance man, but you might just stay straight. Get yourself an education. - [Benjie] Yeah, I see. - Young people got so much going for them these days. - Seem like I ain't got nothing going for me but somebody's mouth. Get off of me. - Mama. - Get off of me. - Mama. Watch it I say. - Get off of me. - Coming in at all hours. Coming in with a fresh mouth on top of it. - That's what you wanna talk about. Not musicians or opportunities. - You keep it up. You just keep talking and you ain't gonna have no front teeth left. One more crack out of you, boy, and I'll slap the black off of you. - No, you won't. Don't you ever put your hands on him. That's my child and no man's gonna put his hands on my child. - If the police pick his ass up off the street, you ain't gonna have no child. - Get in your room, Benjie. Get in there. Now I say. (door slamming) You are not to touch him. I mean it. That's all. I'm through with it. - No, that is not all. Don't be bringing me none of that, Sweets. Benjamin Johnson thinks he is 30, but he is only 13 years old and he's better off learning that from me than from some stranger on the streets. First it's straighten out Benjie and now it's what some man ain't gon' come in here and do to your child. Well I do not play that. Rose. (hand knocking) - Butler wants to like you, Benjie. Let him. - Yes, ma'am. I'll try. - He's who I should've met in the first place, but I never do anything right the first time around. Except for you. Goodnight, Benjie. - Goodnight, mama. (soft music) - I don't know. Maybe we should start busing teachers. It might be the solution. Chicanos want Chicano teachers. Blacks want Blacks. - What's wrong with that? - Well you're asking me to eliminate myself? - Well, you don't wanna support us on welfare. Give us the jobs and we'll give y'all the welfare gladly with a smile. - What are you eating? - Well I usually eat black bread, black bean soup. Black everything. But today in your honor, I'm having a tuna fish sandwich on white bread. - Look I know I am whitey. Even with all the pill popping, with all the uppers, and with all the downers, if I do so much as call a kid a junkie, I have to fight the PTA. I have to fight the principal. I have to fight you. - Both you and the principal should get out. Let the school be wall to wall blackness. - Ha ha. Segregation in reverse. Huh? - If it happens to you, it's in reverse, right? No, segregation is segregation. Ain't no reverse. You're a Jew, Cohen. Didn't World War II teach you anything, hm? Hey Jerry. Jerry, dammit. Come on, break it up. Break it up. Sit down. Sit down. Jerry. - It taught me this. That without a yamaka on my head, without a synagogue, without a faith I am a Jew, yes, that's right. Living in the unseen ghetto of every hostile mind. Now I am here to teach these- - Shvartsa. Well, that's your word, isn't it? Shvartsa, the black one. So you just don't want me to call myself black. Your hair's almost as nappy as mine. Now where you think that comes from, huh? It comes from King Solomon mixing with the Queen of Sheba. A shvartsa. That's where it comes from. - How did you ever make it through a white university? - Well, easy. I just remembered the big white lie that they taught, so that I can someday come back to my own and darkly light the way to truth. - Truth. The truth is that there's a drug situation in this school, but everybody plays it real safe. Nobody wants to say anything. Meanwhile, you are creating an atmosphere which breeds hostility. No, your nationalism is nothing. It's slogans. - Slogans? There'd be hostility in this school if I'd never been born and you know it. Cohen, sit down. Sit down. - Look, I turn out readers and writers. You preach the glories of Africa. - Yeah. - Clean up your local drug situation by yourself. - Oh. Oh because none of your children go here to this school where you make your living, where you teach. It becomes all of a sudden my local drug problem. Well thanks a lot, buddy. - You know, you're a real pain in the ass. - I'm wise. - [Sweets] You know I have Benjie and I have my mother. - Sweets, I came down here today to ask about you and me. I mean, is everything all right between us? - Yes. I mean. I love you, Butler. No matter what happens, just know that. - And what are we gonna do about us? - I mean. Lawyers, courts, papers. I don't know. I mean. I'm just not ready for that. Things oughta just stop and standstill for a little bit. - But they never do, darling. Nothing never ever does. (soft music) Yeah. Get your hands out of my pocket, boy. You know what these are? - Cuff links. - Uh huh. - Mismatch. - Yeah, but they mismatched on purpose, fool. You see that one? - Yeah. - That is a sapphire. Genuine. And the other one is a diamond. One and a half carats set in 14 carat gold (whistles). That's right with 13 diamond chips on each one. My uncle who raised me. He had it made to order special. - Some dude. - Yeah, it's nice to have somebody leave you something. You know? An heirloom. - What happened to him? - Oh, the same thing that happens to everybody. He lived for a time on this planet and then he died. Hey Benjie, look at me. What's wrong with you? - [Benjie] Oh, nothing. - All right. Get down. Woo. - Mama. - Shake it but don't abuse it. - Well, thank you. - 'Cause daddy's gotta use it. - Take care of him, mama. You'll be fine? - Yeah. - We should all be going. - Aw, no. You've had enough of us. - Mm hm. - Going dining and dancing. That's class. - Why thank you, Mrs. Ransom Bell. ♪ And I'm so glad trouble don't always last ♪ - Oh, you always singing it wrong. That hymn goes. ♪ I'm so glad trouble don't last always ♪ - That's right. I think I finally got it. - Perfume smells so good. - Well thank you, mama. - Mama. You look fine. - Thank you, my son. - [Mrs. Bell] Bye. - [Benjie] Bye. - [Mrs. Bell] They sure gonna have a good time. Benjie, what is old? - I don't know. - Well, you aren't there yet. - Old is ailing. Maybe it's one part of your mind going one way while you going the other. One part of being old ain't got nothing to do with aches and pains. It's thoughts. Thoughts can hurt more than real pain. - [Benjie] Yes, ma'am. - Thoughts don't hang together so I can sort them out. It's what mixes me up. My best friends are all dead and gone now. (upbeat music) - Big bad Ben. My man gonna style awhile. Small main line saves money, which you call economics. Make a little go a long way. Let me see something. Whew. Got good veins, too. Look at that. Some take it in the groin. It's a good vein there, too, you know. - Nah, my arm's all right. - You gon' track up your arm like a road map. And deals in hard cash. - My mother ain't raise no chickens. - See there, Carwell, if you gon' be somebody, be it. Man needs money, so he gets money. Just remember one thing. From city to city, town to town, and block to block, there's always somebody who can get you what you want if you got the money. - Treat me right, I treat you right. Y'all have a taste on me. - I don't shoot the shit myself. That's not me. Oh big bad Ben. Style king. Knows how to style, too. - I ain't hooked, you understand? - Oh, I understand. Yeah, definitely, but there are a lot of brothers who are. You can ease the pain just a little bit just dropping it to 'em every now and then. Make yourself some bread, too. - Nah, I ain't a drop man. I'm just me. - Yup, just you. Big bad Ben, the one and only style king. (upbeat music) - My mother didn't raise no chickens. - Benjie. Benjie, wake up. - Get off of me. - What did you do with your grandmother's money? - Money. Get off me. - Boy. - [Benjie] Get off me, man. - All right, explain me this. - I didn't take it. - It's late. - I didn't. - It's late, Butler. Wait 'til tomorrow. - [Benjie] I ain't took no money. - Why? - He's in a damn junk bag, that's why. We got us a 13 year old junkie. - I ain't no junkie. Stop lying on me. - Don't say that, Butler. You don't know that it's true. - I'll never believe that. No sir, it's a lie. - Talk to Benjie. Talk to Benjie. Well dammit, I'm doing it. You know, Ben, strung out wasn't invented yesterday. I tried to be a father to you. - I got me a father. - Where is he? - In that picture there. Don't need no more father than what I got. When I get hold of some money, I'ma give grandma 30 times what she loss. 30 times. - What's lost is not money, Benjie. It's pride. Pride. - But you don't have enough for yourself, let alone any to give away. - You two can have peace of mind. Enemies overcome while you wait. Visit Madame Snowstrom, reader and advisor. Evil spells removed after one visit. Don't laugh. Some of these people got a gift. Yesterday I went to see Madame Snowstrom. Cost me 10 cash dollars. Burn one candle for Benjie. And one for you and Butler. Also some Egyptian incense. And instructions for the indigo blue bath. Double strength. - I don't think that Butler would like that too much. Mama, I do not believe in that foolishness. - Well honey, when push come to shove, you try anything. And I'm still praying. (soft jazz music) - No, no getting high on credit, man. - Stuff short in the street, you know. - Stuff's high but it's never short, Carwell. And leave it alone, man. Skag will blow your health. I don't shoot or sniff. Gives you sores. Eats the lining out of your nose. It also constipates. - Carwell, why don't you lend me some bread? - Carwell stay broke taking care of his own habit. Feeling sorry for people ain't good business, man. Studs wear me out for a fix, then go somewhere else when they flush. No, no getting high on credit. Not even to good friends like you. (soft jazz music) - This a no jive prayer. Send somebody who believes in me. Somebody who be digging me the most. If you there, God. Show me like people say. A sign. Bring lightning. And the world. Do something. God's somewhere else. Mismatch on purpose. One's diamond, the other's sapphire. 14 karat gold. Also diamond chips. - Chips ain't shit. May as well be rhinestones. You know what this is? - What? - Solid gold. Fix him, Carwell. - When. When I get five or $10, can I buy back the cuff links? - Now I'm a pawn shop, right? Listen, how'd you like to run some errands for me? I pick up the cash, you make the drops. You do it on shares. - I'll do anything you want. - Good, good. Take some of the weight off big mouth Carwell over here. - I don't talk. Come on, Carwell. I gotta buy back those cuff links. - With your first spare 10 bucks, right? - Yeah. - Don't worry. You gon' soon feel good. - On the ball. (upbeat jazz music) - [Student] What is the use of living when in fact I am dead? But remember Americans, that as miserable, wretched, degraded and abject as you have made us in foreseeing. And in this. - Benjie. Wake up, son. Damn. Come on, wake up. Wake up, son. Come on. That's it. Come on, let's take care of now things now. Come on, come on. - Looks like Mr. Sparta has just OD'ed. - Shut your goddamn face. (phone ringing) - I signed for you to stay. - Grandma know I'm in the hospital? - Yes. She knows. - Butler knows? - He don't know. - That completes are statement federal notifications. Doctor's now finishing with the police officer. - Mrs. Johnson, Dr. Paul Evans. Hello, Benjie. - What will you do? - Well, the first thing we're gonna do is take some blood and urine samples. See how much toxic stuff he's got in him. Then we're gonna give him some medication. Bring him around nice and clean. And after that we'll just wait and see. Okay? - Can I come to see him? - No, I'm sorry. No visitors. I'm afraid that includes family. - Can I call you? - Sure, if you think it's necessary. Okay, Ben, this is Charles. He's gonna show you to your ward. Any questions you ask him. - I don't wanna stay. No, I don't wanna stay. - Wait, wait, wait, Charles. Come on, get up, Ben. Lesson number one. You gotta learn to stand on your own two feet. Now you get up. Now you say goodbye to your mother. - Mama. I don't wanna stay. I don't wanna stay. Get off me. I don't. Mama, I wanna go home. Ma. I don't wanna stay. I don't wanna stay. Ma. (soft music) (soft music continues) - Who are you? - Benjamin Johnson. - We know that, Benjie. What does that mean, Benny? - It means it's me, that's all. - No, it means you in a detox trying to kick a jones. What else is happening? - What you mean kick a jones? I ain't- - You a junkie. Look at your fucking arms, Benjie. - You a junkie. - You ain't what? - There's no jones to kick. - Benjie's hooked. Don't you know that? Benjie's hooked. - I ain't hooked. Even Tiger told me I wasn't hooked. - [Woman 1] Tiger told you what? Tiger told you what? - Tiger told me I wasn't hooked. - What is this place about, Ben? - I don't even need to be here. - Oh come on, come on. What is this place about, man? - Just grown ups go here. See? You see, you see? You see there ain't nobody here my age. They just stuck me in here. - Nobody's gonna tell you. Do you use dope? - So how does it feel not to know, Benjie? - Do you use dope? - [Paul] Everything is all right, right? Everything's cool, isn't it? - No. Yeah. - Then why is it so hard for you to admit what's going on? - 'Cause nothing's going on, that's why. - Why is it so hard to admit that you got something to deal with, man? That you need to deal with. Now, come on, talk to us. No bullshit. - We've all been age 13. We're all dope fiends. For you to try and run a bunch of shit on us, man, is stupid. How's it feel, Benjie? Every time you stick that needle in your arm, what do you feel like? You feel like a man? - [Man 1] Feels like he's running. - You feel like a man, Benjie? Is that what it does to you? - Is that a good reason to run down, Benjie? - Answer her, punk. - Why don't you just shut the fuck up, huh? What about you? What about you, huh? - What you running from so hard, Benjie? You don't face it, brother, ain't nothing gonna change. - [Woman 2] You can't run from that hurt. - I felt the kind of pain you're feeling, Benjie, and I know it feels like ain't nobody gonna ever do anything about it. It's yours. - I didn't mean to become no dope fiend. It was just one time. - Hey Benjie, fact is, brother, you got to talk about it. All the kind of shit that you run from every time. Got to get that jones down. Got to run from the truth about me, man. You go to school. It's insult. It's hurt, it's a pain. It meant something to you. Now it's nothing. You go home, it's just a reminder, man, that you ain't got nobody. So you run the streets and it's nothing. You're a little black proud man, but you know a little black proud man ain't gonna ever have nothing or be nothing. He's gonna stay black like all the rest of the little proud men. - [Benjie] I won't let nobody criticize me no more. - [Woman 3] Let it out, Benjie. - [Woman 4] What you feeling now, Benjie, is what you been feeling for a long time. - Come on, Benjie. - [Woman 5] You gotta let it out. The only way you're gonna get over it or try to even deal with it, man, is just to let it out and tell people how you really feel. - Benjie, another thing you gotta look at is you're not the only whose lost a father. - It feels like I'm alone, all by myself. - [Man 2] You're not, man. You're not alone here, Benjie, and you're not alone on the streets. - But then why do y'all yell at me? - Your father's gone, little brother. Do you know that? You got to know that, man, and you just got to just let it feel the way it is, man. It hurts. It hurts a whole fucking bunch. - Where are you at? Why aren't you here with me? I need you, dad. I love you. I just need somebody to hug me and hold me and love me, dad. - You gotta take a chance that maybe this time you'll get something. - What's wrong, dad? I loved you. You meant the world. I talked about you, daddy. It's cool, daddy. Don't you know? - I wanted him so bad. Everybody talks about their father and what they're gonna do. Just like in school when I was reading my composition. That's why I didn't wanna read it because I'm always talking 'bout my mother. Never about my father. - How's that make you feel, man? Your own father. He doesn't have any need for you, brother. You love him. You want him. You need to be held by him. - I don't wanna face it. - [Man 3] You gotta face it, Benjie. - I'm a junkie too, Benjie. I've been through the same thing. You don't have to go through the whole life history of being a low down sleazy gut rut dope fiend like we did. You're young, Benjie. You got a chance in life, Benjie. (soft music) - God bless you. - Thank you so much. - Ben, you take care. - Okay. - Bye. - Where's Butler? - Home. He's fixing a surprise. - Yeah? - And I took two weeks off from work. It's my vacation time. - Oh wow. - Yes. - Where's Grandma? - She's home, too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Now, it's just you and me, okay. - Yes, ma'am. - Oh wow. I'm so glad. - Hey. Ben. - What's happening? - Nothing. - Yeah, me too. - My father said y'all be sure come to Carwell's funeral. - Carwell's funeral? - It's just like a community protest. Somebody give him a hotshot. I'll carry your games. - Nah, it's all right. - Benjie is very happy to see you, but please come back another time, will you? - [Mrs. Bell] Welcome home. - Hello, Benjie. - Have some fruit. (soft music) You're a good child. Best in the world. Come. Come and see what me and Butler did. (soft music) - It's nice. (soft music) - Well, I'll go put the roast on. - That's right. I'll help. - [Benjie] Well. - Yeah. It's what your mother has to say, but she thinks that I'll do it better. She wants you to pledge to- - Yes, sir. I promise to never take drugs again and I report now twice a week to the rehab center. Okay? - [Butler] You also have to obey a few rules. - Like what? - Go nowhere without asking. No more cutting classes and be inside this house before dark. - Man, I'm tired of lying. I can't pledge all of that, but I promise not to cut classes. - That's a start. (soft music) - [Claire] Ben? Hi, I'm Claire. Come sit down. And you are? - Butler Craig. - Are you the boy's father? - I'm who he's got for a father. - I'll put down stepfather. Please sit down. - Yeah, that'll do. - Benjie, we'll wrap twice a week and you'll also be seeing a therapist. This is your address. You come from a pretty historic neighborhood. A lot of famous sports people. Boxers, basketball, football players. All heroes. What are you thinking? Come on, level with me. - Nothing. - It's impossible to think nothing. - Thinking you won't move to my block so your son can become a famous athlete. - I like you. You believe that? - Answer her. - No. - [Claire] Why? - 'Cause white folks don't want me near them or their school. They don't like me. - How do you know that? - See it on TV, read it in the newspaper. - Would you rather have a black counselor? - I don't know. - [Claire] Why don't you know? - Some of them be saying don't have no pride in your race. You know, things like that. - Yeah. Yeah, I know that. - Why don't you just start with this young lady? You can always change your mind. - [Claire] Right. - Okay. - Okay. - Mr. Craig, have you ever talked to Benjie about life? - [Butler] Yeah, we'll do more of that. - Would you mind waiting outside? - No, no, let him stay. - Okay. Benjie's to be praised. - Yeah, well praise is in order and not with no hard feelings when knocking is needed. - You agree with your stepfather? - Yes, ma'am. - What do you like most about Mr. Craig? - How he walks and talks like he's not to be messed with. - And what do you dig the least? - Say it. - Looking like he's about to knock me down. - Have I ever hit you? - No. - Hey, rehabilitation takes patience. It's hard work. You gotta be honest and truthful with each other. - You hear that, Benjie? No more jive. Just honest and truthful from now on. - Yeah. Honest. (soft music) This what people wearing nowadays. - Well, he did what he promised. I mean, he bought a suit. Course you can't wear that to school. - [Mrs. Bell] And not in church. - Cars won't have any trouble with him on a dark road either. He's easy to see. - Now that there's a suit. This is a family. Come here, Benjie. That's right, an honest family. Sit down. Well, it's a good fit. - Well, we all here at the same time. - Yes, ma'am. We sure are. - Grandma. Why don't you tell them about when you used to be a classic dancer? - I never was a classic dancer. - [Benjie] No? - You weren't? - When I met your grandfather, I was working in what is called an after hour place. - Oh, come on, mama. - Really? - You know that's not true. - Classic dancer's a polite lie. I was a shake dancer. - [Benjie] Grandma. - What kind of family's this I'm getting into now? - Oh now, stop it. You know sometimes you just talk too much. - Shake dancer. That's what it was. I can hear the music now. - Mrs. Bell, why don't you do your dance for Benjie? - Oh come on, Butler. Now what are you trying to start? - Now come on. I mean, you still remember how to shake, don't you? And where else the boy's gonna see something like that? - Now Mama, you don't have to do no such thing. He just wants to laugh at you. - Yeah, Grandma, please. - [Butler] You still remember how to shake, don't you? - [Benjie] Grandma, please. - All right. Now, it being understood that this is my absolute farewell appearance. - All right. - I wore silk. And lace underwear. - Woo. - All right, Butler. - Yeah? - [Mrs. Bell] One, two, and three and. (bright music) - [Sweets] I don't believe it. (bright music) - Good job, Grandma. Get it, Grandma. (bright music) (woman whistling) - [Sweets] Oh please, stop it. - [Benjie] Oh yeah, Grandma. Do it to 'em. - Lord, forgive me, but we sure seem like a Christian family again. - [Benjie] That was good, Grandma. - It sure does, mama. - You know, Rosie, you wasted our money. We don't have to burn no candles for Benjie and Butler now. - All right, Mama. - Candles? What candles are you talking about? - From the spiritualist. And a bottle of indigo blue to bathe in. - And you telling me not to tell. - But Rosie, that was then. We being honest now. - You all talking about a Christian house and you getting into candles and voodoo and blue baths? - [Sweets] You know you ain't nothing but a spoon stirring and a first class troublemaker. - Oh, you are fussing about nothing. I'm gone. - A bunch of ignorance anyway. - Mama, I didn't know you believed in voodoo. - Shut up. Your father can run. Butler can, too. Mama goes and close the door. I have to stay and try to hold up the roof. Y'all looking for somebody to blame, well just get off of me. - I said. I mean, the social worker said we're supposed to honestly talk and discuss not lose your temper, woman. - My name is not woman. It is not Craig either, by the way. It is still Johnson. You know, I should walk. I should just pack my bags and go on about my business and leave you all to make it the best way you know how. Y'all looking for somebody? Well then find somebody, but just get off of me. Get the hell off of my back. (door slamming) - Think she gonna leave? - No. Well, she's been through a lot, Benjie. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, well listen. You just stay clean and report to follow up or I will have to knock you down. - I can. Long as somebody believes in me. - It don't work that way, Benjie. You have to do it if nobody believes in you. If all others fall by the wayside. Me, your mama, your grandma, the government. Everybody. You got to do it on your own by your self. I tell ya out here on the edge of ugly, you got no place else to go. They don't want you on the job. They sure don't want you on welfare. You know, I remember. Once back home there was this old cracker that just decided to use me as a target. I mean, every time I went by that sucker, he would stick out his foot to trip me up, you know. Yeah, give his buddies their jollies. So all the soul sisters and brothers said, well take him to the NAA. Take him to court. Well, I didn't do either one. Me and my uncle. He was some cat. We caught that tripped up bastard one night and we beat the, well, the bejesus out of him. I said let him take it to court. I tell you, man, I don't. I don't bother hardly nobody, but I am kind of direct in my ways. - Bet you you could beat anything and anybody that stood in your way. - Well. I wish it worked that way 'cause I been in this world for a long time. What I need is more of this to go with that. That's what I need to learn among other things. - Look at mine. - Well, you're getting there. Little bit longer, yeah. (soft music) Come out to see us, huh? (soft music) - By the rivers of Babylon. There we wept when we remembered Zion. - [Woman] Yes, Lord. - Carwell Morton. A native of this city is now dead. - [Woman] My, my, my. - At age 12. He was raised in an orphanage, two reform schools, and lived for awhile in a foster home. Unable to recognize his own importance, he became lost. In search of something now called a piece of the action. He saw the top dogs. The big brass. And too many of us grabbing, snatching, clawing. Yes and even killing for a share. I say it everyday. About everyday. There is now a way of killing us off without ever firing a gun. You see, we have been taught to destroy ourselves and pay for the privilege, don't you know? Our children have become their own executioners and ours. Brothers, sisters, we're too quiet. We're too quiet. Carwell Morton is survived by a loving foster parent, Mrs. Gloriano Whitford, by various juvenile institutions, and by millions of fellow citizens who knew him not. As one of the moneyless sons of Nat Turner. Poor as a Rastafarian against a sick and corrupt society. Owning nothing of value except the breath in my body. I now promise that breath, my every word in his memory. Every word I speak. Every breath I take is in this child's memory. Child, I will never forget you. Never. Every fight I wage is for you. Freedom. Freedom. Amen. - [Congregation] Amen. - Amen. - [Congregation] Amen. - Amen. - Should've never happened. - Yeah, I know what you mean, Benjie. It's sad. It's sad, man. - Sure don't make you look forward to dying. - No, it don't. - All those things they do to you. The suits. Flowers. Songs. Sermons. Man, it's a bad scene. - Yeah. I hear you. Benjie. Wait up. - Benjie. Benjie. (horn beeping) - Folks die. They oughta fade away. - Sometimes I wish there was some other place to go besides home, parents. You ring a bell. Somebody open the door and say come on in. - And asking no questions. Call up your house and say don't worry. Don't fret. He's here with us. So y'all roll on over and go on back to sleep. - [Jimmy Lee] They'd say come on in. What can I do for you? - [Benjie] I'd say nobody did me no big wrong, but I gotta get a divorce from my parents, my neighborhood, my school, so I can think or not think for two, three weeks. - [Jimmy Lee] Maybe. Maybe that's the place where Carwell hanging out now. Think so? - [Benjie] Heavy, man. Heavy. (soft music) - Benjie. Benjie, where you been? Benjie, didn't we go to a funeral today? A boy younger than you died. Benjie, you're driving me out of my mind. Where you been? - I had some business. Some business to tend to. - Business? What the hell kind of business? You're a child. A 13 year old child. - Man, ain't no more way to be a child. It's rough out there. I mean, you gon' be holding my hand taking me wherever I gotta go? No. You got your own thing to do, right? - Yeah, I go to work. - Benjie, we are telling that you got to live right instead of wrong. - Ain't you ever done anything wrong? Spade ain't married to you no kind of ways and you bringing him cold brews. Drinking mash and talking trash like he president of the USA. About you, Uncle Butler. You supposed to be a maintenance man. That's a jive ass name for a janitor. You can't even get a chance to blow off your shiny horn. In your spare time you shacking up in my mama's bed. Heroes. Man. We living in the time where a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich. Just give it up, jack. You and Sweets. Just cool it off. - I've got to go 'cause if I stay here, I will kill your son. I will kill him. - Butler. Butler. Take every stitch of clothes off. Take it off I said. Strip butt naked. Swirl the water. - For what? - Swirl the water I said. It cleanse all the evil and the devil out of you. - Ain't no devil in me. - Oh yes, you under some kind of spell. I don't know what is is but you got to be. I'm gon' wash it and wash it 'til I wash it all away. - I ain't gonna be naked in front of you. - I said get in. - What is it? - Blue indigo. Get in, goddammit I said. - No. - Goddammit, get in there. Wash your brains out. - The neighbors can hear you. - Go on back in your room, mama. Go on back. - You losing your mind. I'm gonna be poisoned. - Benjie, don't you splash no water on me. Butler is gone. Goddammit, he's gone for Benjamin Johnson Jr. Butler's gone. - Butler. Seem like you know a woman with regrets. Cool it off. Gonna be somebody's mother. - Come on. Stand up, stand up. - No. Let me cover my personals. - You ain't got nothing I ain't seen. Nothing to see no way. God. No man to cook for. No man to look for. And no man to leave me no more. No more. And I'll be glad when you're gone the hell out of my sight. It's stupid, ignorant superstition. - Maybe this blue bath gonna do me some good. Don't feel bad. I didn't mean to splash you. He's gon' come back, mama. - Oh splash me, Benjie. Splash me. Splash me from head to toe. Oh just splash me all over. Maybe I'll stop thinking about him. Maybe I'll learn to forget him. Maybe I'll learn to live without him. Splash me. Splash me, Benjie. Splash me (laughs). (soft jazz music) Hi. - A rye and ginger for the lady. - [Bill] You got it. (soft jazz music) - On the rocks please, Bill. - [Bill] All right. (soft jazz music) - If I knew where Benjie's father was, I'd ship him off on a one way ticket. - No, you wouldn't. (soft jazz music) - Sweetheart, I'm dying. What to do? - Even if we got married, it wouldn't make any difference with him. - Lately I see Benjie everywhere I go. On the street, on a bus. I just left him at home and there he is. - Yeah, he doesn't know it's nation time. Too much of this nation is on the nod. - We gonna have some cocoa and then I'm gon' tell you all about the old times. And don't blame your mama for that blue bath. I went to a spiritual advisor and that's what she recommended. - I understand. - Did you have fun in the hospital? - Some. - Like what? - Learning to play chess. Had ice cream. - We got two kinds of ice cream in the box. Once I won a Sunday school prize for reciting Bible verses. Much better than dancing. What you thinking? Penny for your thoughts. - How come I got plain bed spread and bunnies on my curtains? I ain't a child. Besides, I like plain the best. - With bunnies was three for $1 and plain cost 75 cents a yard. (clock ticking) You crying? - Since I been to the hospital, my eyes water. (clock ticking) - They be back soon. (clock ticking) - Grandma. Grandma. Got a lock on your door. Grandma. Who put a lock on your door? (soft jazz music) - We all take a little something to make us feel good. No more natural joy. It's all gone. (soft jazz music) You leaving me? - I'm leaving Benjie. - He is mine. And I am his. Well. I guess that's best. - Yeah, maybe it is. I mean, even prize fighters get a minute between rounds. I wanna kiss you, Rose. - Do it. Do it. (soft jazz music) - So long. (soft jazz music) I can't leave you, Sweets. - Butler. What are you doing home this time of day? - Did you report to rehab today? Benjie. Did you report to rehab today? - Yes, he went. It's over on. - No, he didn't. - [Sweets] Benjie. - [Butler] No, he did not. - I had some business to see after, but I didn't take any drugs. I'm clean. I'm clean. - More than once you made your mother cry. Your grandmother can't walk down the street at high noon on a count of the likes of you. You've stolen money from her. You've stolen from me. You're trying to separate me from the woman that I love. We're all doing everything we know how to do. So now, you little lying no good bastard, I'ma take the rest of the afternoon off and give you a beating. I mean an ass whooping you will never ever forget. - Butler, wait. - [Butler] Benjie. Come back here, boy. What I say? I'll catch you, boy. - [Benjie] Leave me alone. - [Butler] You lying bastard. (tires screeching) (horn beeping) (tires screeching) - [Benjie] Ow. (soft music) - [Butler] Benjie. (stair squeaking) (dramatic music) Dammit. (dramatic music) - [Benjie] Leave me alone. (dramatic music) - Benjie. Hold it right there. - Why don't you just leave me alone? - [Butler] Dammit, Benjie. Hold it, boy. (dramatic music) Benjie. - Ah. (dramatic music) - Hold on, boy. (dramatic music) Climb. Come on now, climb. - No. (dramatic music) No. Help me. Help me, help me, please. (dramatic music) No. No. (dramatic music) Let me die. (dramatic music) Let me go. (dramatic music) Stop. - [Butler] Dammit, Benjie, come on now. - Just let me die. - No, I don't want you dead, Benjie. If I lose you. Come on now, climb. Climb, Benjie. Come on now. Dammit, climb. (dramatic music) Come on, I got you. (soft music) Damn Benjie. Oh shoot. You be sure to report to rehab tomorrow. All right? - You. You. You gonna be there, too? - All right. I'll take off of work early one more time. - You know, Butler. You ain't the worse person in the world. Maybe I am. - Thank you. - Drop me. Drop me. Let me be dead. Drop me. Let me be dead. Drop me. Drop me. - Butler. - Hm? - Did you hear him? Did you hear him? - Mm hm. Maybe. He's got to be alone sometime. (soft music) (phone ringing) - Looks like he's not coming. - Well Benjie likes to look through store windows. Kids stall looking at windows. I got off work early. Could be he's at home thinking I'd go there first. - Oh yeah. Why don't you use the phone? I'll use the one in the hall. - [Claire] We can setup another. - I've been down here for two hours, Sweets. Okay. (horn beeping) - Hey. - Hey. - Where you been? - Around. - My dad, Cohen, geography teacher been marking you absent. Absent. But I told everybody you sick. - Man, why you lie? - You into skag. Check it, man. Bad news travels. - Man, I might take something now and then, but I ain't no user. Come on, let's go find a smoke. - Nah, I got other things for $1 to do. - Like what? - Saving up for a set of drums. I'm delivering groceries. You wanna do it? - Man, three for $1 ain't nothing. - Straighten up, Benjie. - Man, why don't you just keep that jive ass advice? You made it in basketball and now you hitting on the drum. That make you a social worker? You a chicken hearted chicken shit phony. - Look man, smoking something I did to pass a little time. Now I ain't got much time to be passing. Out there is bad ass. We need to keep our wits woke. - When you was smoking, I was there. Now you gone. - Some time it pay to back down. - Hey, if I wanna shoot up, I shoot up. If I stop, I stop. - Okay all right, fly high, but you gon' come down low using your veins for horse racing track. Junk will knock you down. - Yeah, news does travel. Tell me your mother's like a doorknob. Every man gets his turn on her. - Needles spike guys. Needles. Needles. (soft music) - Fuck you, Jimmy Lee Green. (soft music) - Hey, no more, brother. We're closing. - I got to make an appointment. - We have to do it with the child in person, man. The child must be present. - Man, don't be pulling on me. Don't you do that. The counselor said that Benjie needs to identify with hero figures and give me this list of books about black history, movie stars, baseball players. - Mr. Craig, you see we can't make an appointment without the child. - Look, brother, this is not the way to get things done. - Your daddy's shoes were never under my mama's bed, so don't call me brother, goddammit. Heroes. I'll tell you, man. Some of these celebrity, big time high lifers. I mean, they can't take care of themselves. They in worst shape than Benjie. He's better off trying to learn to identify with me whose got to get up every day and face the world. Benjie say a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich and y'all say a hero is a celebrity? Well listen to my credentials and see if I qualify for one of them hero buttons. I'm supporting two adults and one child and the United States government on my paycheck and I can't claim none of them for a tax deduction. So don't explain to me nothing about no heroes. I mean, some of your neighborhood success stories are making a fine living off of Benjie's veins. - If he doesn't show, we simply start over again. That's all. - We don't wanna start over. We just wanna keep going. - I'll stay with him. (phone ringing) - Butler? - Yeah, that's me. - What's happening? Hey. Hey, look. What's happening? - I'm waiting for my son. - Didn't know you had one. - I could go down to the corner, but he might think I left. You still playing bass? - Some. Getting straight, you know? - Yeah, I think across the street gives a better view of the corners, you know. - See ya, Butler. (thunder rumbling) (soft jazz music) - Come on, Benjie. Don't hold back now. Come on, Benjie, it's nation time. You can do it. (soft jazz music) I'm waiting on you, man. I believe in you. I do. God knows I do. (soft jazz music) (thunder rumbling) Come on now. (soft jazz music) Come on, Benjie. It's nation time. - [Benjie] Butler. (thunder rumbling) (soft jazz music) (bright jazz music)
