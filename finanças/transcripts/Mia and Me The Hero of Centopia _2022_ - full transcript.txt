[music playing] Woo-hoo! [laughs] [panting] Yah! Ha ha! Ha ha! Whoa. Hey, guys. I've got a special delivery! Want to race to the cave? I'm guessing that's a no. What is it? Is it a plant? I don't know. It's not like any plant I've ever seen. And these formations just appeared overnight, Nino? Yes, Your Majesty. Glitch here noticed them with the changing of the guards this morning. And the shield still holds? Yes, Empress. [crashing sounds] [gasps] Huh? Father? Where is everyone? [music playing] Father! What are you doing here? I've got the Empress's lunch. Get back. It's not safe. Don't worry. I'll look after lunch. That doesn't sound good. The ruby. Toxor's going for the ruby gemstone. The shield is down! He's coming. You're all mine now. Are you all right? Father. Toxor's dark magic. Don't breathe in the smoke! Guards, protect the Empress. Toxor. Surrender, elves. Yeah! I order you to stop. What's he doing to the guards? They're turning into groundlings. [laughs] No! [gasping for breath] Dad, what's happening? Toxor, he's trying to escape. You must get the ruby, Nino. Get the empress out of here. Yes, Dad. Oh! Nino! Father! Get the empress, fool. Get her. Dad! No. EMPRESS: Iko. [laughs] Free at last. Come to me, groundlings. The elves of Centopia will pay for my imprisonment. [laughter] [laughter from book] RADIO PRESENTER: And welcome back, folks, to BDXFM. It's a beautiful 26 degrees. The sun is shining. And if you're lucky enough to be out there. [MUSIC - KATRINA & THE WAVES, "WALKING ON SUNSHINE"] (SINGING) Don't want to spend my whole life just waiting for you. (SINGING) Now I don't want you back for the weekend or back for one day. I said, baby, I just want you back and I want you to stay. (SINGING) I'm walking on sunshine, oh yeah. (SINGING) I'm walking on sunshine, whoa. I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh-oh.

I miss summers by the water with Mom and Dad. I miss them too, Mia. Whoa, the turn-off! You OK? Yes. Yeah, sure? MIMI: [meow] Oh, sorry, Mimi. Are you OK? MIMI: [meow] GRANDPA: I... I thought maybe you might have left that book behind this time, hmm? You know it's really important to me. Yeah. Yeah, I know. But wouldn't your parents want you to start making some stories of your own? These are my stories. [music playing] GRANDPA: Home at last, Mia. Three years and it looks pretty good, right? I don't know. Feels different to me. Beautiful, huh? MIA: Yeah, I guess so. Come on, let's go check out the house. MIA: I think you underestimated this, Grandpa. No. It just needs a little bit of love, that's all. I'll get the stuff from the car. Or we you just go back to the farm! [music playing] YOUNG MIA: But I don't want to go to bed. I want to go swimming. Mia, we've been swimming all day. Now it's time for bed. How about a story? Yeah. A story about a magical white unicorn. YOUNG MIA: Yeah. MIA'S MUM: Are you ready? Once upon a time, there was a magical white unicorn and she was walking through the woods and she met a little girl. She says hello, little girl. Will you be my friend? I miss you guys. Really? [music playing] (SINGING) I got sunshine in heart even on rainy days. Even on rainy days. You're like a sparkling star in the sky and you light up the way. And you light up the way. I've got sunshine on my heart, a smile on my face. A smile on my face. Because when you're with me I feel you are my favorite place. My favorite place. [laughter] Grandpa! Are you OK? I never felt so good. I think it's time for a swim, don't you? Well, there's still a lot to do. I'll stay here, but you go. Oh, come on. We deserve a break. And it'll be fun. Yeah. No, I really think I'll stay here. You know, I... I remember a time when you enjoyed things other than that book. Yeah. I'll go put it in my room. Now that's a good idea. Hey, how about an early lunch? Yeah. I'll get the food from the car. All right. [magical ringing] MIMI: [meow] An oracle. Oh Mimi, this can't be good. A monstrous evil will forever ravage all the lands lest the faraway child and a new friend gather the precious three in hand. GRANDPA: I don't even have a picnic... Grandpa. Mia? Don't worry. I'll be right back, I promise. GRANDPA: What are you doing? Mia! [music playing] [laughs] [laughs] It's good to be back. Whoa. Ow. Where did you come from? Where did you come from? Whoa! I asked you. I asked you. You first. You first. What? I'm on a quest to save Centopia. I'm on a quest to save Centopia. Wait. Stay back, you sky pirate. Pirate? I'm Mia. I'm here to help. Do not touch anything. But... oops. Ah! My flighty balls. No! Out of the way, ship-wrecker. I'm sorry. Just let me help you. I've got this. But... I don't... Are you sure? I'm sure. I got this. No. No more helping, ship-wrecker. Sorry. [screaming] Welcome to the final of the summer solstice dance off. Hit it, Chico. CROWD MEMBER: Go, Chico. CROWD MEMBER: Go, Chico. CROWD MEMBER: Love that monkey. Yes, party creatures, we're down to the last three contestants, and the first is Prince Mo. Woo-hoo, yeah! CROWD MEMBER: Go Mo. Go, go. Go Mo. He's going toe to toe against the elf with the lightest feed, Yuko. [dancers chatting] CROWD MEMBER: Go, Yuko. Oh yeah. And to prove that four feet is better two, it's our favorite unicorn Onchao. CROWD MEMBER: Yeah Onchao. Yeah Onchao. [dancers chatting] Woo, yeah! Woo-hoo! More flowers, Phuddle. Coming right up, Your Majesty. Any second now. Everything OK with your invention, Phuddle? Absolutely. My part-time petal pincher is 100% reliable. Oh, ow. Oh, most of the time. Well, that's not right. Ah! All hands on deck! Little help, please. Oh dear. And batten your hatches. We're in for a bumpy ride! Whoa! [chanting] May I present my newest invention, the Phuddlen, yeah. Centopia's first flying DJ deck. That's right, folks. It's all just part of the show. [laughs] [gasps] Oh look, more guests arriving, dear. They're not guests. They're party crashers. Everybody, run! [screaming] [coughing] They're OK? ELF: Hey, welcome. [chatter] ELF: Welcome back! Hey, there. Oh, let me do the talking. Are you sure? Elves of main island, I am Iko. [gasping] Are you OK, Iko? Who said that? Where am I? Hey, Mo! Yuko! Hey, Mia. Onchao. Who's your friend? Is he from your world? Pretty boy. No, I... I just bumped into him. You call that a bump, Mia? Whoa. Are you OK, friend? Are you my mommy? Mo, we need to talk to your parents. Centopia's in trouble. IKO: Parents? I need to speak to the king and queen. Most parents are the king and queen. At your service. Welcome, party crashers. Oh, Mia. Good to have you back. Thank you. Now, I recognize that uniform. You're from Lotus Island! Welcome to the party. You're going to take that with you when you leave, aren't you? Yes, Your Majesty. But I bring grave news. Toxor has escaped. [gasping] Who's Toxor? To the palace. We have much to discuss. Carry on with the party, everyone. We'll be right back. [music playing] [laughs] Ah. [laughs] He he. No more flying for you, I'm afraid. [neighs] [giggles] Huh? [neighs] [gasps] Master Toxor, we've caught a unicorn. Very pretty. [laughs] Pretty? I'll give you pretty. [laughs] [neighs] Better. I shall call you Hook Face. [neighs] You, big fella, mount me. Yes, master. Back to my lair, Hook Face. Ride like the wind. [laughs] [music playing] MIA: That's Toxor? MO: I know, so gross. And stronger than ever. He used his dark magic to change my dad's guards into mindless slaves. Oh my. [gasps] My dad died trying to stop him. I'm sorry. Empress Shuba sent me here to gather an army. If we don't stop Toxor on Lotus island... Then all of the islands will fall. Who's that kicking Toxor's butt? MAYLA: The hero of Centopia. Maybe she can help us? MAYLA: She left this world long ago. But you coming here, Mia, at the same time that Toxor has escaped cannot be a coincidence. Tell us the oracle, Mia. The oracle? A monstrous evil will forever ravage all the lands lest the faraway child and a new friend gather the precious three in hand. Whoa, my orders were to gather an army, not gather precious things and hold hands. What's this oracle anyway? An oracle is what brings me from my world to Centopia. Your world? What island is that? It's not an island. It's a land far far... [gasp] Mia! Yes, I'm the faraway child. I'm the one who can stop Toxor. [music playing] Ah, who needs wings to fly around like some sort of annoying insect when I've got you, Hook Face. My valiant trusted steed. Now, why don't you go and eat some mushrooms or something? [shouting] What? [laughing and groaning] What are you numbskulls doing? You're supposed to be looking for my red stone. Have you found it? Here, master. Excellent. You're lucky I don't throw you all into the pool of fear. That's madness. No please. Very bad place. Get out of my sight before I change my mind. Never again. Master, master. I've come to report we have converted more elvish villages. Your army grows. Yes, yes. Well done. Glitch, isn't it? Yes, master. Hmm, I need you to help me. Anything, master. I need you to attack me. Uh, why? Because I'm going to use this red stone as a shield to defeat you just like the hero of Centopia defeated me all those years ago. Now, how did she do it? She held it out like this. No, no. Like this. And... all right, hit me, Glitch. OK. You call that an attack? Put your back into it. Ow! Ugh. Are you OK, master? Fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Stupid stone. Why does it not obey me? I don't know, master. Ooh, maybe you use your dark magic on it? Mm, I think I'll use my dark magic on it, Glitch. [laughs] Oh yes. Oh yes. Look! Glitch, look! It glows! It glows. [laughs] Huh? What is this? Ooh. Sire, we need your army now. Iko, we can't do anything until we figure out the rest of the oracle. This was made on Lotus Island. Huh? No, my parents gave it to me. Why is it glowing? It's too early to go back. I just got here. Oh look, there's a frog in the window. It's Toxor! What are you up to you pesky elves? What is this sorcery you weave? Elves? Can I see? Hi, elves. How did you get... Get out of the way, you idiot. You have a stone too. IKO: He's got the ruby shield! We're coming for you, Toxor. Come and get it, you winged worms. [burps] If that's Toxor, then who is that? [neighs] It's another gemstone. Three gemstones? Three precious things. [neighs] We need them to defeat Toxor. Three gemstones to defeat me? No, they're mine. Mine! No! [coughing] I breathed in burnt toad. Where did that lightning come from? [neighs] Onchao thinks it may have been the storm unicorn. Wait, you can understand unicorns? Yes. [neighs] He says that the storm unicorn loves to collect shiny things. It's got to be him. We have to find him. But my mission. Our mission is to save Centopia together. Yes. If Mia is the faraway child, then you, Lotus boy, must be the new friend. Ugh, friend? But I really need to... Trust the oracle, Iko. That's right. Mo and Yuko shall lead our forces to Lotus Island and keep Toxor at bay until you return. Ugh. Mia's quest sounds way more fun. Shucks, guess it's just and me, Mo. [laughs] That's the spirit. Fine. Where do we find this storm unicorn? He lives alone on an island that floats above an endless ocean. Great. So how do we get there? My ship was destroyed. PHUDDLE: I got it, I got it, I got it. I think I have an idea. PHUDDLE: [laughs] ELF: Don't go anywhere just yet, folks. We're about to start the ponycorn race. Are we going for another lap, Phuddle? [laughs] No, no. Everything is 100% under control! ELF: OK, if I can get all the ponycorns to line up by the rainbow tent, folks. The king and queen will be here shortly, so let's get ready. And remember, you've got to be under three feet to compete in this race. [neighing] You just need to switch this little guy off here and... Hi, Phuddle. Ah! Mia, you're back! It's good to see you too. My friends Iko and I need to borrow your flying machine. PHUDDLE: Huh? Flying machine? Oh, the Phuddlen. Sure, Mia. Oh, are we going to another party? We thank you, Phuddle. It takes a brave man to volunteer for a mission this dangerous. Oh, you're welcome, your majesty. I just... what? Did I miss something? Thank you. Sorry, time to pack up. Party's over, everyone. [disappointed groans] We're off to save Centopia! [cheering] Long live Centopia! Yay, Centopia! Woo-hoo-hoo-ho. Seriously, what is going on? Mm. Mm. Huh? Oh god, get off me. My head hurts. That wretched storm unicorn. This gemstone is powerful. Yes. Yes! But no one can use it against me now. Destiny calls, Glitch. Bring me the two remaining gems. Uh, where do I start looking, master? Oh. You go to Stormy's island because that's where the she-elf is going. You get both the stones, you see? And don't fail me! Yes, master. I mean, no, master. Can I take Hook Face, master? Yes, and take two other groundlings as well. Yeah. Woo! I said two. Huh? Oh. Oh, don't look so miserable. I'll let you rub my feet. [laughs] Yeah! [music playing] Make sure those ropes are tight, Zolanda. On it. Gubu, we're going to need more bananas than that if we want to get to Lotus Island. Yes, your majesty. Hey, you need a hand with that anchor, Shiva? We can always go with them, my dear? We're needed here, Ray nor. We have to look after the creatures of Main Island that can't defend themselves. Oh, we wanted to go on a boat. PHUDDLE: Ah! Phuddle, what are you doing here? I thought you were getting the Phuddlen ready? Yes, your majesty. Just had to grab some vital supplies. Got to go. Very important parent coming through. I don't know what you're saying, but good luck! Morning. PHUDDLE: Coming right up, Mia. At last. Here we go, Mia. I just have to install this final... Whatever this is. Will it make it go faster? No, but it will make us go. [laughs] Yes, yes. Any second now. Woo-hoo-hoo! That's it. We're good to go. You rock, Phuddle. [neighs] Whoa, someone's keen to meet Stormy. Come on, Iko. Please stow all hooves, wings, and magical artifacts for takeoff. And get ready to be history! You mean get ready to make history, right? Huh, probably. Probably? [music playing] Bye, Mo. Bye, Yuko. See you on Lotus Island! Bye, Mia. Good luck! Looking good. Doing great. Just imagine what I could do with more fingers. Oh, Mia, can I be next? Of course you can, Phuddle. Every captain needs a shiny coat. Oh, yay! Iko? [sneezes] Thanks, Mia. Oh. Let's see. Ahem, who needs blankets when we have my genuine patented warmy puppies! Huh? What? And one for you, Onchao. Why do you call them warmy puppies? Whoa! [laughs] I mean, aren't they great? No. I can't move like this. You sort of can. Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh. Ugh. Oh my. Phuddle! Yes? How do you take them off? Take them off? [neighs] Onchao, oh dear. [neighs] Oh! Ah! Blankets it is then. [both laugh] Yeah. [music playing] PHUDDLE: Well, good morning, sleepyhead. MIA: Morning, Phuddle. Have you been up all night? PHUDDLE: This captain never sleeps. [laughs] I've never seen a sunrise in Centopia before. You can't see anything in this fog. Phuddle, do you even know where we're going? Of course. I just close my eyes and feel the wind. Be the wind. ONCHAO: [farts] Oh, Onchao! Ugh. [neighs] [gags] We're doomed. There's no way we can do this. Hey, Iko. What? Whoa, it's OK. We'll get there. Just relax. Relax? How can I? My home has been conquered by an ancient evil toad, and the fate of Centopia is in the hands of that guy. [laughs] [gags] Ah. He's doing his best. [sighs] I know. It's just, why would the oracle choose us? Choose me? The day Toxor I escaped I was just bringing the empress her lunch. OK, so... So how can I be meant to save Centopia? The oracle is wrong. The oracle is never wrong. It is this time. My dad, he was a real hero. And now I can't even ask him what to do. I just feel so... Lost? I didn't even get to say goodbye. I understand. I lost my parents three years ago. They drowned. Oh, Mia. I'm really sorry. After they died they... They left me this. But how did your parents get a bracelet from Lotus Island? I... I don't know. They must have wanted me to come to this world. So what do we do now? We save it. [thunder] PHUDDLE: Oh my! Breeze is picking up. Looks like we found Stormy. PHUDDLE: Yay. Ugh. Captain's log, my greatest regret is that I didn't bring any mayo for my bile turnip sandwiches. MIA: Shh. Hear that? We're not alone. Ship ahoy! That looks like a Lotus Island ship. Hey, do you need help? No. Groundlings! We've got to get out of here. It's Glitchy! Phuddle, go! I can't. They got it hook, line, and sinker. She-Elf, get her. Iko, look out! Naughty elf. Don't breath in the smoke. It'll turn you into one of them. GLITCH: [laughs] [neighs] Onchao! Bye. Now go. Get glitch She-Elf. Get elves! Yeah! Get the elf! [indistinct]...rubbish elves! [laughs] Easy there. Oh. Ooh. It wasn't me. GROUNDLING: Come here, you little... Whoa there. Easy, girl. You are a girl, aren't you? Oh. Whoa! [neighs] Onchao! No, don't hurt her! [neighs] Mine. Give it back. Naughty elf. Take that, frog face. Come on get it. Yeah. [laughs] I can do this. Go, Mia. Eat brush, you big boy. Must have stone! [thunder] Huh? Huh? [screams] Uh-oh. Must have... Hey, no. ...Stone. Give me that. That's mine. Bye bye. See ya. Glitchy is unstoppable. No, my sapphire! All right, Hooky, ride like the wind. All hands on deck. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ah! Got you, Phuddle. [screaming] Captain's log, I wish I wasn't the captain anymore. Stormy's Island. Hold on. [neighs] Whoa! [screaming] Is everyone OK? Yeah, I think so. No, there's one casualty. [neighs] Yeah, he took the sapphire. What? They got the stone? And you crashed the ship? Ugh. What? Well, I wasn't the one throwing lightning bolts. You were the captain. You were the pilot. I didn't see you at the wheel. Oh, that's not... Well, your haircut makes you look like a chicken. What? Guys, this isn't helping. [neighs] We're supposed to work together. We are a team. Ah, well, this team doesn't have any stones. We don't have a ship. We have nothing. We came for Stormy's stone. We need to find him. [neighs] Yeah, he owes me a new ship! Wait, where is he? Yeah, Onchao. You're right. Let's fly up there. We'll get a bird's eye view. IKO: Yeah. Come on. [laughs] Let's go! Guys, slow down. I can't fly, remember? [music playing] I don't like this. Chico? Who brought the monkey? Ah, he brought himself, Mo. He just wants to help. Well, he can help over there somewhere. Gubu, fly up and see where the city is. We need to know how far this jungle goes. Yes, your majesty. Ah! What? [gasps] Wha? Gubu, are you OK? Shh, listen. [groaning] What is that? We have to go help him, Mo. Gubu, come back. Sorry! Give me that. Everybody split up into small groups. Fan out. Ah. Yuko, you stay with me. No one flies until we find Gubu and this Lotus city. Everybody stay within shouting distance of each other. [monkey noises] [music playing] What? What happened here? Nothing good. [monkey noises] Yep, I've got a bad feeling about this too, Chico. [screaming] One of the groups is in trouble. [shouting] More than one group. This way. [shouting] No, this way. Yuko, wait. But they need our help. I can't see them, Yuko. Where are you? Yuko! Yuko! Whoa. Someone likes jewelry. PHUDDLE: Yeah, me! [laughs] Ooh. [music playing] Whoa. Stormy. Well, he looks nice. Thunder, how many more thieves must I smite today? No. No, no. We're not thieves. Please, don't smite us. Yes, we hate being... Smote. Wait, you can talk? You can speak elf? Of course I can, you silly thing. I am the great Storm unicorn. Whoa! I can speak many tongues of Centopia. I can speak dragon. [speaking dragon] Duck. [quacking] Pig. [oinking] Crab. Well, actually, crabs don't really talk. It's more of an interpretive little shuffle. Sort of the [gibberish]. Hmm, what? Oh. [laughs] You are thieves! You're pinching my precious booty. It's time to taste the thunder. No! Wait, Stormy! Stop! Why should I? Because Onchao is right. Centopia is in trouble. We need your help. My help? [scoffs] You're lying again. No one ever needs my help. [neighs] Toxor's back? So I didn't imagine it. He was in my drinking bowl. And the key to defeating him is in your necklace. You want the emerald of hope? No, no, no. I can't. Why not? It's all I have. You think I don't want to help? You think I don't want to go back to have a life and friends? I've been banished! Banished? Why? I rained. I rained on a parade. It was an accident. Everything was ruined, and the other unicorns were so mad. I ran off before they could yell at me. Wait, so you banished you? Well, I had to. I couldn't risk the humiliation! Mia, is he shrinking? He's crying himself out. This shiny rock is all I have now. That and also millions of others. But I'd trade it all for friends like yours, Mia. Except the hair. The hair stays. Where I come from, unicorns are rare and precious. So just let it all out. Feels good, huh? It does. It really does. I am precious. Thank you. No, no. Don't cry, Stormy. You'll disappear. Don't tell me how to feel! Just go. I'll be fine. No, please. Come with us to Lotus Island. We need the stone, but we need you too, Stormy. Do you need me? Really? You are the great and powerful storm unicorn. You didn't ruin the parade. You are the parade. Yes, Centopia needs you. Centopia needs me. Then what are we waiting for? Lotus Island, here we come. Time to ride the rainbow. Woo-hoo! Whoa! I always wanted to travel at light speed. Woo-hoo! Yes! Is it just me or does this rainbow taste like... Fuzzberries, yes. It's my own special recipe. Goes well with chocolate. Whoa, nice. Thanks for sticking with the mission. Well, it's like you said, we're a team. We stick together. [neighs] Lotus Island dead ahead. [laughs] Well done. Master ask. Glitch deliver. Where's the other one? Huh? One? That one? No, the other one. Not that one? I asked for two stones. Where's Stormy's stone? What about pretty blue stone? It's so pretty. Glitch! Where's the third stone? Um, don't know exactly. Oh! What kind of useless hedge goon can't defeat a couple of elf kids and a crybaby unicorn? Unicorn was mean. And not just any elf kids, master. Strong and brave. And brave enough to beat the unicorn. Brave enough to come here. Oh, of course, silly me. They'll just defeat the Storm unicorn, ride it's magical rainbow all the way to my door step. [neighs] Oh look, the storm unicorn's magical rainbow and they... Whoa, what is that? A goat? Oh, master was right. Master is so wise. Glitch get troops. Get stone. Uh, no. You want something done. Hurry up, Glitch. Coming, master. This can't be right. I don't recognize anything. MIA: Are we sure we're in the right place? My rainbow's never wrong. Huh, there's Toxor's cave. STORMY: Brace for landing! PHUDDLE: Here we go! Phuddle, are you OK? Oh yeah, I'm fine. Don't you worry about this, Pan. So, Lotus Island. It's nice. It's no main island, am I right? The flowers. The trees. Toxor's destroyed everything. Find Yuko and Mo. No, we're so close. We can end this now. We'll sneak in and steal the stones back right from under his nose. Where did that come from? Ah! Fly. I wouldn't if I were you. At this range, they won't miss. Glitch, get me the last stone. Yes, master. Hand it over, little unicorn. Never! Oh, don't worry, Stormy. I'll look after it. It will be joining the others in the pool of fear where no creatures dare to go. [laughs] Ground them all, Glitch. And get me that stone. [neighs] We're a team. We stick together. Get me that stone now, fools! Hey. Give it back. Mine. I need it more. I'll take that. Ah! Phuddle! Eat lightning! Stormy, no! Stormy! Not my shiny rock! My stone. I've got it. Let's fly. [coughs] Oh no. [neighs] Iko. Iko! Stone. [laughs] I'll take that. Thank you. Back in your bog, you rubbish toad. Yuko, Mo! Guys, how many times do I have to tell you I can't fly! Ah! Oh, Onchao. But Iko's still down there. [laughs] We have to go back. We need Iko. We can't save Centopia without him. We can't. Toxor's forces are too strong for a direct attack. But we can use the Main Island elves, right, Mo? Sorry, Mia. They're gone. Yeah, we were attacked as soon as we got here. Only a few of us managed to escape. Oh no. No, and Toxor's got all the stones now. He's going to throw them into the pool of fear! Oh boy, is he crying again? [horn blowing] Oh, they're leaving. Did we win? Toxor is rallying his forces. We mustn't give up yet. Come on. [music playing] Well, that's it then. I'm officially unstoppable. [laughs] Oh. Honestly though, I thought this would feel better. Ah! [coughs] The prisoners are waiting, master. Prisoners? I mean, your army. They're outside. Oh yes. Good. Great. You are loyal to me aren't you, Glitch? Is there another option? Oh, no. Never mind. Now I just need to squash that Lotus queen and those last remaining elves. [laughing] [music playing] Welcome to Lotus City, friends. I wish it were under better circumstances. Oh, it is stunning! I live in a tree. Mia, Mo told me of the oracle. You, faraway child, are our only chance of true victory. But it... it can't be. It must be wrong. All I've done is fail. Hey, hey, hey. Mia. Trust in the oracle. Only you can retrieve the stones, Mia. I tried, but it wasn't enough. I lost the sapphire. Iko is gone because of me. [neighs] Don't cry, Mia. Mo, Yuko, take everyone to the palace walls. You're in charge of the defenses. Come. I have something to show you. Well, right, you, guard, how many troops remain in the city? Oh, three lotus squadrons and a handful of elves from Main Island. Don't forget me. I'm the great storm unicorn. You're not a ponycorn? Ponycorn? Ah, let me at him! YUKO: Phuddle! Yes. We need an invention. Something that's going to stop Toxor's groundings in their tracks. An invention. Of course. Excuse me. Pants. I brought pants? I don't even wear pants! Oh, think, Phuddle. Think! All these tools, there has to be something I can do to help. What about this? No. Oh, that's no good. Oh, that'll never work. Oh, this. Oh, but I need a tack. Oh boy. What the... get me out of this. [gasps] I'm so sorry. What is this thing? I can't move. Yes! Oh, Phuddle, that's brilliant! Yes. Can you make a lot more of those things? Well, I'll need a workshop. Does the empress have a workshop? She has a special machinery room, sir. Yes, that'll do. [laughs] Huh? [laughs] Hammers, sprockets, winches. Oh my! [laughs] And where do you keep your springy parts? [music playing] [laughs] Smoke them out, my groundlings. [horn blowing] What is this place? The hall of heroes. And there is someone in here you need to see. Is that Toxor? Yes, lord of the lilies. He was wise and kind. He looks so happy. What happened to him? He was consumed by hatred for all elves because he could not fly. And that's the hero of Centopia stopping Toxor. Look closely at her, Mia. What else do you see? She has a bracelet just like I do. YUBA: It's the same bracelet, Mia. I made it for her. But that means the hero was my mother! Yes, Mia. You are the faraway child come home to save us all. It's me? Yes. That's my mom and dad. I see your mother's courage in you, Mia. You can do this. But without Iko how can I succeed? [horn blowing] Destiny will reveal itself once you have the stones. Come. [horn blowing] [laughs] Show no mercy. Whoa! Ah! Give them all you've got! [gasps] Onchao! Wow, get the baby unicorn. Who are you calling a baby? I'm not a baby. Going to get you! Oh, big unicorn! There's too many of them. Get them! Mo, come on. Back to the city. [horn blowing] This passage will lead you outside. Pass the groundlings and fly as fast as you can. The pool of fear will play tricks on you, warping your mind. Remember your courage, Mia, and you'll find the stones. OK. Oh no. [gasps] Whoa. I've got this, Mia. Go. Thanks, Stormy. Phuddle, are you finished yet? Two burp springs. Four wheel screws. Nearly, Mo. One more... [gasps] Duck. Duck? Oh wow. Whoa. The engage on impact now. [laughs] Oh, that is 100% Phuddle. How many do you have? Five. Five? 500! Retreat. Get the elves. Get the elves! You can't hide! [laughs] Surrender, elves. You have no chance against my forces. Try these new weapons made by Centopia's greatest inventor. How do they work? Just throw them! ELF: Yeah! MO: Nice work, Phuddle. YUKO: Phuddle, you're the best! What is this Phuddle? [groaning] [music playing] Take that, you meanies. Nice shot! That's right. Bounce them back. Well done, Phuddle. Hit them with everything you have! Huh? Use the puffy ones as cover. Ugh. Phuddle, I'm out of puppies. Mo, look out! Yuko! No! No, Yuko! Yuko! Fall back. Fly to the main hall. We need the high ground. PHUDDLE: We're in so much trouble. [music playing] [gasps] It's just a quick swim. Paddle. How bad can it be? Just get in. Get the stones. [groans] Iko, is that you? Must stop elf. Iko, it's me, Mia. Please! I know you remember me. Stop, elf. Wait, we're a team. You don't have to do this, Iko. Must stop elf. Mia. We have to join forces, remember? You're my friend. Save Centopia or obey Toxor. You have to decide for yourself and choose your own path now. Mia, go. What's going on? WOMAN'S VOICE: Give up, Mia. It's over. I have to save Centopia. WOMAN'S VOICE: Save Centopia? You're no hero. I have to try. They're counting on me. WOMAN'S VOICE: [laughs] They don't need you. They do. They do. WOMAN'S VOICE: This task is too hard for you. You can't save anyone. You can't even save yourself. And you couldn't save Iko. Stop it. WOMAN'S VOICE: You're just an orphan. You'll never be enough. I am! I am. WOMAN'S VOICE: You'll fail, and everyone will forget about you. No, it's not like that. WOMAN'S VOICE: No one waits for you. Wait, Grandpa. Grandpa is waiting for me to come home. WOMAN'S VOICE: No. No, he's not. Onchao. Phuddle. Yuko and Mo. Iko. They haven't forgotten me. WOMAN'S VOICE: No, you're alone. If I was alone I'd be scared. But I'm never alone. All my friends are always with me. I'm not scared. I'm Mia. I can do this. [music playing] Mia? Mia? [sharp inhale] [coughing] Mia. Iko, you came for me. Thank you. What now? Three precious things in hand. We've nearly done it. Come on. Oh. Huh? No wings. Whoa! Smack, smack... Ah! Get elves. Get the elves. Stay back. Ah! [gasps] Oh, I got to work on those landings. Stormy! Mia! You got your powers back. Yes. Had a little drink from the lake on the way over. Thought you might need some help. We got the stones, Stormy. Iko and I need to get to Toxor. Well, let's giddy up. [laughs] Look at you pathetic magical flying creatures and whatever you are. What? The pretty prince! I thank you for all those elves from Main Island. I really couldn't have taken this city without them. [laughs] Empress Yuba, guess what? I won! Once I've grounded you I think I'll let you do my laundry. [laughs] STORMY: [neighs] Mia! Yes, yes. Time to razzle dazzle. Hold off, Stormy. Iko and I have got this. You! Brave and stupid. You'll make the perfect underling shield. My name is Mia. My name is Mia. I don't care. MIA: Well, maybe you should care. My... my stones! How did you... wait. Hey, you, grab those stones now! You heard him. No, don't grab them! Oh, you're going to get it now. Huh? Nothing happened. Oh no! But why? Oh, Mia, I really feel for you. [laughs] But the oracle, the... The new friend. Once I make you into a groundling I'll be the only friend you ever need. [laughs] I'll be your friend. You're right, Toxor. You and I need to be friends. [laughs] What are you doing? Don't! No, what magic is this? Friendship is a risk, Toxor. What? MIA: I know you feel lonely. Just give friendship a chance. Stop this magic. Take my hand. Be my friend. Be happy again. Happy? Just don't let go. I... I feel so... So good! [music playing] Freedom! What happened? Mia? Mia! Mia. Yuko? Mia! Thank you. You did it! We all did together. Iko? Dad? Oh, Iko. Dad! My boy. You're alive! Looks like you and your friends saved us. It's so good to see you. I'm so proud of you, Iko. PHUDDLE: Mia, young lady, that was really dangerous. What happened to the stones? They're in pieces. I guess there was no other way. What? But how will you get home? I don't know. It takes a great warrior to stand up to a powerful enemy. But only a true hero could show her enemy mercy. Elves of Lotus Island, friends from far and wide, I give you the new hero of Centopia! [cheering] [MUSIC - URTONMUSIC, "GOOD OLD DAYS"] (SINGING) We've been running straight towards a beautiful find at 10. I found what I came here for and I know that we'll meet again. I know it can hurt sometimes, and moving on don't make sense. Because every minute with you is beyond comparison. So let's have one more dance for eternity. Come in closer. Put your hands on me. Butter feet. I'm leading. Uh-uh, I'm leading. Whoa. Lead on. (SINGING) You're only a daydream away. Oh wow. [laughs] (SINGING) Let's make these the good old days. Ah. Toxor! Glitchy. Great party, old buddy. Have you come for your revenge? Revenge? What gives you that idea? We're all friends now. Oh. [laughter] Wow! Yeah! (SINGING) Because every minute with you, yeah, I never take them back. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry you can't get back home, Mia. But you could always stay with us on Lotus Island! (SINGING) Come in closer. Put your hands on me. Or you can stay with us on Main Island. Or, Mia, you can stay with me on Stormy Island. I've got beautiful ocean views. Stormy, I... I need something. Oh, anything, greatest inventor... Ow, you just plucked one of my nostril hairs! I needed that. I think I'm going to cry. PHUDDLE: Perfect! Thank you. One unicorn tear is all I need to make this work. Phuddle! Oh, thank you. Oh, you're the best. According to my calculations, there's enough spark in that sapphire for one last trip. You mean I can never come back to Centopia? So this is goodbye? I was just starting to like you. [neighs] I'll never forget you either. Whoa! Bye, Mia. Bye, Mia. You two take care of each other. I think we can manage that. Centopia is forever in your debt, Mia. Your parents would be proud. Thank you. TOXOR: [clears throat] Thank you, Mia. For everything. Take care, friend. Huh? No, I'm never letting go. Oh, Phuddle. Suck it up, Stormy. You don't cry. [neighs] Bye, Mia. I love you! Bye, Mia. Bye, Mia. Bye, Mia. Bye, everyone. I'll miss you all. Mia, come back. Come on. Come on, give me back my granddaughter! [grunt] It worked! Grandpa, are you OK? Am I OK? Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK. What happened? There was a flash, and you just vanished. Well... And I was so worried about you. I thought I'd lost you to this darn book. What is going on? Uh, well, believe it or not, it's a long story. Well? MIA: I'll tell you all about it. But first, how about that swim? A swim? Hey, what have you done with my granddaughter? Oh, Grandpa. It's so good to be home. It sure is. Oh, what are we waiting for? Last one is a stinky toad! Wait for me! You wait for me! [music playing] I won! Hey, you win, you win. Come on. Get in! Cannonball! [laughter] I'm gonna get you. Oh yeah? [indistinct chatter] [MUSIC - "MIA AND ME THEME SONG"] (SINGING) By the magic book I was sent so far. Now I'm flying to the sky of Centopia. Walking step by step and I don't look back as I explore this wonderful place. Is it just a dream or some fantasy or maybe just another kind of reality? As I stand my ground when the darkness falls I feel I've got to be a hero today. Ooh. Come and fly with me. With Yuko, Mo, and me. Oh, come and fly with me. There I'm Mia. Here I'm me.
