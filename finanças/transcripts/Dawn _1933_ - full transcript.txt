An UFA feature Dawn Screenplay: Gerhard Menzel Idea: E. Freiherr v. Spiegel Cinematography by Carl Hoffmann Directed by Gustav Ucicky Our flags are waving on the mast. They proclaim the power of our kingdom. We don't want to stand it any longer that the English man laughs about it. Because we're going, because we're going, Because we're going against En - ge - land. Because we're going, because we're going, Because we're going against En - ge - land. What the hell is going on in Meerskirchen? I've never seen that many people in one place before. Our U-boat men are leaving today. Lieutenant commander Liers! Our U-boat people! Jawoll, yes! Our Liers, Mister! Did you never hear of lieutenant commander Liers before? Every child knows him! Jaul! Jaul! Jaul! Jaul! What is it? What is it? Please, leave him to me for the few minutes! No! Mine! Mine! He belongs to me alone! Yes! And if we had climbed the church tower, then they had brought us down as well. Even proud of it, ain't you? Bursting because of pride, boy. And you? You not at all, hm? Sure! The whole town is proud of you three. Thus I may be a bit proud of you as well. Right? Actually, I'm nothing. There are quite different characters! Thank you! Thank you! They are crazy mother, are they not? And you're happy about it as I know you. And you either. Don't dispute! It all applies to me. ls our Jaul already here? Here, lieutenant commander! We've received enough acclaim we don't take premature praise we are superstitious! Alas, the mayor has to speak again. Short and sweet, I hope. It's a deep felt necessity to me in this moment when our U-boat heroes are leaving to express the pride and delight of the whole town. They have been with us for a week. They pleased us and we could listen to the stories of their feats. The unforgettable feats of our U-boat are known all over Germany. Meerskirchen is proud that out of its bricks alone three sons are fighting on the U-boat, which is feared by the enemy and admired by fatherland. A son of our honored Mrs. major, who already has given two sons Let it be! Yes. I am quite allowed to say that our lieutenant commander Liers whose glory moderately reflects on us as well and someone else, whom we like to consider as one of us first lieutenant Frederiks, who grew up with us and lived here for twelve years, becoming a man, and who accompanied lieutenant commander Liers through thick and thin on every single tour. And our friend Jaul, the radio operator of the U-boat. A Jack of all trades. Father always comes up with nice words. Please, join in to the call: Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Well, little cousin? Does it look like that, Fips? Ha, ha! No! Not that romantic. More dirt and oil and powder and so on. Not that sweet! A pity! Then I don't know how to imagine it. Not at all! What's with you, Fips? Why so sisterly? Always sisterly! Not a little bit of throbbing? For an old U-boat soul? No. I don't think so. Let's listen! Maybe? Wonderful! That's how it starts. Only a little and then You've got something woman-like. Recently. Pretty. You love YQu? Me! Of course! Who else? Not so hedonistic, Fips! Children! Leave him to me the last few minutes! Jaul, you're a proper radio operator, ain't you? Yes, write it down for him, mayor! What I have to tell him, works orally only. Jaul, you have to make it happen that we hear about . the ongoings on the U-boat. You see, Jaul The train! The train! The train is leaving! The train is leaving! Mayor! That helped. Quick, come here! It's pretty empty. But the others! Well, when the time came, it's always been quiet. Often I sat here, saying goodbye. And Albert an Erich didn't come back. You're the last one! Why do you say that, mother? So that you understand, why I submitted a petition for your leave. The factory is lacking a man. I can't. As long as the war lasts my post is out there on the boat. SQ? And me? And you? Jawoll! And me? Me? Alas! You think, I'm an old woman. Nobody needs to get upset because of me? For I won't need much anymore. You're telling me the truth face to face. Your post is out there on the boat. But I don't want to hear the truth! No! Mother! Didn't you always say to us as it comes it gets eaten? Oh! Of course! It gets eaten as it comes, mother! Mr. Petersen? I checked the astronomical calendar, Mr. Petersen! Disaster is hovering above the tour of our U-boat! Nonsense, Lottner! Don't panic! Today it's October, 13th, Mr. Petersen. Disaster above the U-boat, I say to you! Mr. Petersen, I'm absolutely sure! Scaremonger! We'll take care you, you know! Everyone has to die, finally. Thus you don't have to care about How! But care about the Why! Understand? Jawoll, captain! Mother! What's important? Life? We don't know. We care for things of least significance. And what's important, we don't even see. Maybe . . . death is the only event in life. Look! With Albert and Erich to me it means They are not dead, gone and erased to me. One day all of us will know why and what for. so: SO? And that's a new-fashioned religion, or what? One two three four five six seven Well. Three little Jauls would be enough! But only one has arrived yet! And number two, hm, Gretl? I will hope, hm? Now we're leaving It shouldn't have been my fault. Well, and for number three I'll have to appear once more. If we didn't have killed two birds with one stone this time! But Gustl! Gretl! Here, Missis, give me a chocolate bar for my wife. That loving couple heartbreaking farewell scene? Kiss, kiss Here are no lovers! Although there could be one! Possibly could. But somehow it's not working. Because someone is a fool. You won't say that a second time to me. If someone says fool then Fips always thinks someone called for him! Ha, ha, ha! Dear child! In my day you didn't fool with men like this! It's the war, Mrs. major! You have to bring up big guns. Can be, can be. The cannon thunder makes you deaf! Ladies and Gentlemen! The train is leaving in a minute. Actually, we have to be there in half an hour! Thanks to all of you. We will take pains to claim honor for the fatherland. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Expect most certainly a reunion! That lies with God. And the English! (sung in Swabian dialect) Must I go, must I go out of town, out of town and you my dear stay here! When I come, when I come when I really do come, when I really do come home I'll come to you my dear! If I can't be with you all time I'll still be pleased with you all time. When I come, when I come when I really do come, when I really do come home Take care, Gustl! Take care! Are you already sniffing the big vessel? Something isn't right, Fips! Something is hanging in the air. Course 315 degrees. Course 315 degrees. For nine long days. Nine days! But I do swear to you, on the 10th that vessel will pass our nose! I swear to you! Both diesels stop! Both e-motors slow throttle ahead. Jaul? Man the radio room! Once more antennas out! Well, Juraczik. My intuitiveness! The captain is looking for something special out here. ls looking for a long time, the captain lieutenant. Waits and waits. And pretty ships pass by. He easily could have sunk 10.000 GRT. What the Capt.-Lt. is looking for, he finds! Juraczik, man, this here is in Meerskirchnern like an antenna! When you're from Meerskirchen you're a visionary, hm? Ha, ha! Dumb stays dumb. There is no medicine for. Piranha, holy Man, your polar bear has quite a waved fur! Ha, ha, ha! You! The Capt.-Lt. has to feed polar bears. Man, he is doing it! He is throwing fish, don't you see! Headline: It's eaten as it comes! Because we're going Because we're going Against En - ge - land. Petermann! Capt.-Lt.? Man, you're singing a pirate song like a funeral march! It doesn't pay out to be funny, Capt.-Lt.! It does! Make it cheaper, Petermann! Nose torpedo room, silence! Immediately our position! Jawoll, Capt.-Lt.! Still the peace of God all about? Still no whispering around here? Not a soul! Capt.-Lt.! What if we can't find the English armored cruiser? That's all I need! The whole Eastern front depends on it! Any idea, Jaul, who's on that ship? Heavy ranking folks! General Staff! Instruction officers! They shall help the tsar on his legs again. Make the steamroller roll again! We'll win through in the end. Capt.-Lt., you're, in a manner of speaking, not at all from bad parents. To fail what am I saying? That word does not exist! Captain's order: exact position! Captain! A regular in the radio room. That's right! As if it leads to anything! Probably knows why. Holy Brahmaputra! Capt.-Lt.! The English, the English! Bridge on keen watch! This should spice things up. Both e-motors stop! Both e-motors stop! Quiet! Noises! Map! Don't move! Capt.-Lt. is listening in the radio room! Attention!

But, dear captain, that we haven't heard of the U-boat for nine days doesn't worry me at all. Quite the opposite! I'm very optimistic. I bet that our U-boat got a major challenge. But I don't deny it! You don't. A pity. You had lost the bet. SQ? I am going as far as to say that every hour a message is to be expected. What do you say about that? Mr. Kramer, Mr. Kramer! What's going on? Within an hour a message from the U-boat is expected! The mayor has said so! Thelma, Thelma! Message from the U-boat within 30 minutes! Mr. Wilken, Mr. Wilken! In 15 minutes we will get a message from the U-boat! Message from the U-boat has arrived! Mrs. Jaul, something about our ship in the naval staff's report? But, I've heard it!

Don't duck yourself! Three-fourths of it I do already know! Impossible, the boss! Dear Mr. Krake! We do know, I must not get excited! It's not possible! Mr. Krake! If you don't hand over the paper immediately I'll tell your wife about the beer last Whitsunday! But I have everything forgotten! Thanks. Nothing! There it is! There it is! I'll be jiggered!

I'm happy that the men on the boat of my son are safe and sound. But there is no reason to be proud about it. Realize that! They did their duty. And the duty was bitter. Why shall there be happiness when, and who knows how many, people sacrificed their lives, also performing their duty. We have to thank God for the fortune that we didn't have to suffer his time. And to beg Him that he relieves the sorrow of those who have to suffer this time. But, I thank you. You meant well. Today we want to sing u little song. We want to drink cool wine.

But maybe maybe they did want something completely different? But we have to! Where only was my mind? Our life belongs to ...not to us anymore. Not to us, BtShm! Right? We have to sail as long as we can lift a finger. Again on the boat, and again and again Until god relieves us of duty. Sleep well, good boys. Who gives his life for his brothers Sleep well. Ready for diving rescuers! Open floor valves! 'Lieutenant commander Liers and seven men rescued.' 'Lieutenant commander Liers and seven men rescued.' 'Lieutenant commander Liers and seven men rescued.' Last time you screamed Hooray! This time you don't scream. Why not? Because one is missing. Or because the clouds turned dark?

Not like this, my dear! The cotton out of the ears, the black glasses off! Even if a gale is blowing and some in Germany start to chatter with their teeth Don't care! It's just the weather we need here from time to time. Thus coming to strength again. In broad daylight we're scattering in every direction. But in deep dark night and when it gets to you Then we Germans reunite! Fifty years of night! That doesn't blind a single German. Helga! Thank you that you in spite of everything came. All the time you almost didn't talk at all with me. No. All the time, almost no word. Why not? Although I knew it all the time that someone is waiting. You knew? Yes. But man only understands just one minute before the train is leaving that he's forgotten the most important. Now it's engaged. What, Gustl? The lieutenant commander the English can't engage. Why not, Gustl? Because that woman over there was faster! Ha, ha, ha! But Gustl! Let’s go, Jaul! Then let's go! Not so fast, not so fast! Save something for the next time! Yes. For the next time! * subs by Amedee *
