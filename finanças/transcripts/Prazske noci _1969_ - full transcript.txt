The Nights of Prague Mr. Fabricius sincerely thanks you for your invitation but has to apologize. He would very gladly visit some of the cosy Prague wine houses but his duty is forces him to look through the contract he's about to sign tomorrow. And that will consume much of his night tonight. 43. - Here. - Thanks. A beautiful evening, isn't it? What shall we do? Am I late? Do you also love antique things? I'm sorry? Me? I absolutely love antique things, if I'm not alone with them. Fabricius, Willy Fabricius. I've craved to meet someone like you. This is my driver, Vaclav. It's not good to be with a driver all the time. It's cold tonight. I have to tell you something personal: I'm not too experienced with women. You'll overcome this. Tonight I need to tell someone... you... so many things. - Do you understand me? - No. I mean yes... yes. Completely. A man who has to endorse such an important contract tomorrow... - Yes? - ...might not understand my worries. - How do you know? - Does it matter? Come. - But know that I'm dangerous. - All beautiful women are dangerous. But I'm more and in a different way. There's a real danger. That's wonderful, danger is my thing. That's what I'm looking for in Prague! Everyone wants to kiss me. Everyone. I would be happier if I wasn't so beautiful. Get out! The driver... Promise me, you won't be??? as the others were. Promise me. Yes, yes. Still on the face, so I'll stop crying. More, more... more... ...more, and that's it! Sit and listen to me. Sit and listen! A woman is the more dangerous, the darker her eyes are and the paler her skin is. Be careful not to cry, like that one there. - And why that one cried? - He trusted a woman. Naftali Khaym. And here a rabbi Rudi Loew is lying. Was it his woman? Come, I'll take care of you. Close your eyes... and listen. A Jew and an emperor quarreled over a golem. A Jew and an emperor. Rabbi Loew made a human out of clay , a golem, but then took away his life again. The emperor Rudolf was mad about this golem. So he summoned rabbi Loew to him. Welcome, rabbi. We have summoned you... - Why have we summoned you? - I believe I know why. His imperial majesty wants supposedly to ask me to bring to life the golem Yossele. And I'm answering once more, I must not to do it. Yossele has already fulfilled his task and saved my people from its enemies. That's why it's not allowed to me to bring him back to life. There's no need for that. There's no need for that at all. We don't ask for anything from you, rabbi, anymore. We'll have a golem even without your help. Rabbi Neftali ben Khaym from Krakow. He will do what you deny us. Neftali be Khaym... you won't be blessed. No, the golem Yossele is not fit for the task. And yet... something has to happen. To create a golem for goys' fun what a disgrace of the Kabbalah! If I won't stop it, a rage of God will crush me, ai-ai-ai! This Neftali is a demon's helper. I have gazed in his eyes and what have I seen? Darkness... And lust. Lust... What's your name? Why don't you speak? Are you deaf? You're beautiful like the glow of God's throne. Naftali... Naftali... To me... to me... To me... to me... Naftali... I'm here... Naftali... Naftali... Don't be afraid... To me... to me... To me... to me... Naftali... Naftali... I'm... here... Naftali... Naftali... Naftali... It was you who called me? You're a weird, deaf one. What do you want from me? Why do you want to help me, why? Oh so... because you love me... Why not? Fool! Is the golem ready yet? You only have strength to enjoy yourself. Forgive me. I was testing you. And now I know you're not a tool of my enemies. My golem will make a bed for us. And after that, making love with you will be more than all the emperor's gold. Who are those two? Evil spirits. - Helpers. - And he wants to do with them... What I was doing with you. - Conjuration of elements? - Yes. And now... One of the evil ones... conjures the golem... with the element of fire. - And now... - What? The element of water is entering the golem. Naftali is invoking the element of air. You're the first one who has seen him. My servant. I've created him. Of course, he's alive. Don't you believe me? Golem! Come closer! Stop! Now... Now, do you believe me? Old Loew will die with shame. He was able only to make Yossele, the dwarf. He was afraid! And he has a lion in his emblem, the hairless rabbit. I'm the lion, me, a creator of giants! That's my servant, stronger than Samson. Just a word, and he'll destroy the Prague castle as the temple of Philistines. Of course he obeys me. Say what he should do. Naftali ben Khaym... If you really are... a master of the golem... command him... to bow to us. Why not? Golem, bow to us! Women can't be trusted, you know? Not even when they are made of clay. We have to love a woman. Love deprives her of all weapons, but only a true one... Goose! Don't you see he's sleeping? He fell asleep because of your babbling and now it's half to two. Do it right now. There won't be better opportunity. Of course, that's just like you. You've always only thought of yourself, that's why you've ended like this. Get lost! What are you afraid of? He's mad about you. You know very well what I'm afraid of. How convenient for you. Get lost, or you'll regret this! I don't mind anymore, but you'll suffer. I hate you! If only you had a piece of heart in that body... - Don't touch me! - You fell asleep! I'm telling you a story and you fall asleep! At the rabbi Loew's grave, on which when you put a pebble and make a wish, it'll come true. 14 days I'm all over Tatras, Beskydy, Karlstejn, I hadn't a single moment for myself... And finally when I meet a being with which I could be for weeks... - What am I supposed to do? - To love me! For Christ's sake, I don't want anything else. A stone... a pebble. Give me something hard, - to put on the Yehuda Loew. - Here. I want her to love me, I want her to love me... - What do you want? - Her to love you. Make the man disappear! - In the car! Immediately. - Yes, sure. Pardon me. You have to trust me. I also want you to love me. No, no, no... Let him love me... The graveyard excursion is hopefully at an end. I don't think about anything else since midnight... come, come, quickly. And down. Down, I say, or I'll be very angry. I know there should be foreplay, but that's enough. Don't think of this as vulgarity, but we're going to my place. What a little, tender and enchanting girl. And so cruel to good Willy. I don't know anyone here in this... foreign city. No one I could tell a story, no one I could tell... Ouch! A pin. A little reparation. The countess! What countess, we're all alone here, Zuzanka. She had always been dancing too. I don't want to end like her. I want to end it. You still don't want to understand me. Well, speak. Go on! Speak! Talk yourself out. Let's have a talking party, Kitty. It'll be really extravagant. The countess was... was... a woman, well. The destiny will direct everything. A magical square... love... lover... ...a murder... a love... a heart and a disappointment. - When did I go to sleep, Mici? - At three. - I look like a corpse. - You're only imagining it. Have you seen a corpse, Mici? It was the count, last time. He looked really well. 12. - Where is the knight de Saint Clair? - He's been waiting for an hour. Only an hour? Let him wait. - Mici! - Yes? - Or not... Let him come in. Welcome. Well... I haven't seen you in a long time. I've been missing you. - Why won't you come in? - I don't want to bother you. You can't bother me. - Won't you help me? - Yes, how? Bring me the flagon over there. My friend, you're a bad chamber-maid. You have to learn a lot from Mici. A lot. Isn't it true, Mici? Satan, won't you beg? Satan is begging. - At your legs even Satan would beg. - Why not? If I'd like, he would have to beg too. Well, jump. Come my little thing... - And who... who does organize the ball? - Our officers' brigade. You have time for costume balls at war? Don't run away, you scoundrel... - Mici! - Yes... I want to have a costume about which would all Prague would talk. Will you arrange it for me? You know, I would arrange everything for you. - What will you wear? - A Venetian domino. What an original idea. - A boy has stolen a leaf of bread in the kitchen. - A loaf of bread? I'd like to see the idiot. Isn't there something more interesting in this house? A loaf of bread is worth it's weight in gold at this time. Oh no... Is this him? Go... no, wait. So that you know there are better things in the world. Bread... That's it, Satan. A bakeress. A bakeress! I'll wear the costume of a baker. Isn't it a sweet idea? - And you have some credit too in it. - Credit? - I don't know why. - Haven't you said something about bread or bakers? - Yes, yes. - My bakeress will have a lace cap with a blue ribbon sewed on, folk wanna-be, but, of course, a coquettish one. the dress will be made of white brocade, with a deep cleavage, lined with a frilling and coloured ribbons. And over it naive decorated buns and rolls. - Thank you. - And the best at the end... Do you know what the shoes will be made from? Bread. - Bread? - Yes. - Bread shoes in these time? - Isn't it a little...? - It's because "it's a little"... And which shoemaker will make them? You've said you'd do anything for me. - I'm an officer. - Bring me shoes made out of bread then! - Countess... - Hm... - Countess.. - What? He's been waiting for three hours. He wants to say something very important to you. - Who? - The knight de Saint Claire. - Him? - Hm. - Important? - Ouch. - What's then? - What is it? - A snuffbox. - Men are stupid. - What should I tell him? Nothing. - Does he have my shoes? - No, he says nobody wants to make them. - Send him to the hell then! - Where? To hell. To hell! To hell. To hell... What is it? Mici! A man becomes an alien against his own will. An empty palace, careless servants, what a bad time. Who are you? I'm not a nobleman, but I'm noble in my craft. The knight de Saint Claire sent me. Come here! - So you're able to do it? - Oh, sure. Only if the Countess will let me take her measurements. Please. Here, please. Hurry up! - What a shame the countess is not a penitent. - Why? She would only walk barefoot and we would... - What are you doing? - I'm taking inspiration. - Weren't you beaten for the inspiration sometimes? Sometimes, yes. So, take the measurements! I've finished the knight's shoes recently. Brilliant braces, silk ribbons... well... But your shoes will be made out of the most golden crumbs, the whitest crust, Countess. You've made me very happy, knight. You don't know how much. Why those masks? Are they coming to the ball too? - Knight, I don't recognize you. - I understand. The shoemaker! Oh, you make shoes in a palace? Why not, I'm a weirdo. I like costumes, masks. It's my hobby. At least you're not boring. Thank you, I'll try. Oh no... and it's done. Watch your steps. Come. Oh no... There is still some trouble with the servants, as you can see. I'm sorry. I've been away for just a little while and now there's so much mess. Won't I miss the ball because of you? No, no. We'll have a lot of fun. What is it? - Does it play? - Does it what? - Oh, so. Sure. - No, let me. Is he dead or alive? I don't know anymore. It's not too cosy in here. If it was only a little possible, I've kept everything in the original state. - That's a memorial place, madam. - Yes? - You're in Faust's house. - Oh! - Here, the house master himself. - Oh. Someone was sharpening his claws on it. No loss. The doctor looked completely different anyway. Did you know him? I know a lot of people... And where is the hole through which he was taken by the devil? Oh... the devil... that's a little bit vulgar, isn't it? Here. I let it tighten up, it was quite windy. Shall we have a drink? Is this a joke? Who are you, really? A weirdo... and let's say, a supplier. - I can supply anything. - Even shoes out of bread... Not only shoes out of bread. I'm not too narrowly specialized. For example, when the Morzin brothers was alternating in possession of your bedroom's key, I supplied them with first class pistols. Morzin brothers? Ah, that's why they were shooting so well. And do you know that baron Eichenberg poisoned his wife with my poison? A bad one. It has led him to the scaffold. - He was a fool. - But a gentleman... - He didn't tell anything about your complicity. - Who are you, sir? - The doctor is angry again. - I want to go home! Will you let me? You're free. - You're a great dancer. - Oh no, I'm just a tired man. But your husband, what a dancer he was. He was still dancing and dancing, until he drowned. Yes? And after that your servant Jakub was killed by your hound dog. She was out control, we had to shoot her. Even the dog paid for it. What is it? Shall we dance a little more? Have a little mercy for an old man. There are plenty of dancers. The Morzin brothers? The ones with a good shot. - That's impossible! - Well... You wanted to go to the ball and here you are. So? - Shoes, help countess! - No! Baron Christian Leopold of Eisenberg! Do you recognize your executed friend? - Jakub. - Yes. Jakub. Your husband's servant and your lover. He held your husband's head under water. And you set the fierce dog on him to get rid of the witness. Go on, Jakub, don't be afraid! Enough, self-murderer! Who's your master? And she's still dancing... Countess... in her quarters... Why not? She has time, quarters, shoes... Why wouldn't she dance? Do you know something else, darling? To sit next to you for the whole evening is much worse than the whole shoes story. Look, I'm leaving tomorrow. For sure, we won't see each other anymore. It's completely unimaginable for me to leave - and... nothing... - Leave me! I thought that as soon as the man is gone... - How much? - I don't understand. - Oh, you do. How much? - She's not for sale. She craves you. She's only a little... I know her... Count on me. You have to say... Love behind the grave and so... That's her weakness. After that, you can have everything. Twenty dollars. You've earned them. Twenty more. Sympathetic man! Has he said...? What has he said to you? Nothing. He didn't have to. My love... I've immediately understood that you're completely different from all others. Dear, be patient. Come to me, you're allowed to. But first I'll tell you everything. Everything. A kind, hospitable pub, is a paradise for strangers. Red and white wines are filled here to the brim. Wine, music, mes amis - that's all there could be wished for. Everything is mixed here for taste, sight, hearing, touch. Senses are feasting, blood is boiling. Delight is, however, incomplete. A woman is in reach. Everything comes. No fear. There will be love. It'll start with teasing... All in time, there will be even time for bed. Tender touch is teasing senses. Love - that's a feast. There are even murders out of love - what an idea, I beg you. A tired body huddles, a sweet sleepiness comes. Love with the scent of ripened quinces... don't let me stand here for long. The heart of a soldier will crush you completely, love has no power over it. Nothing lures me, I want only to enjoy, before death, a woman at night. I'm sure that I won't go mad because of a woman. I'm sure when I encircle the world, I'll return back home alive and healthy. I'm sure, I'm sure... A dove flew from a rock, he sat down next to a pond. will he ever meet, won't he ever meet will he ever meet a hen? You let him fly away, he won't be drinking without a loved one. Will he ever be back, won't he ever be back? I hope he won't drown, I hope he won't drown. A kind pub... A kind and hospitable pub... The heart of a soldier will crush you completely, love has no power over it. Nothing lures me, I want only to enjoy, before death, a woman at night. A dove flew from a rock, he sat down next to a pond. will he ever meet, won't he ever meet will he ever meet a hen? will he ever meet, won't he ever meet will he ever meet a hen? The girl was punished with a terrible curse, darling. Well, that's understandable. Torture in hell, and... and... frying, right? Throughout the centuries, year by year, second by second, she's boiling in a burning sap. Only once in a 190 years she's allowed to go out in her car... I understand, in her car... ...to find a man who would kiss her out of love. Do you understand? Out of real love. - Because if he only pretended... - He'd be bad... He'd end up in hell forever. In hell, sure. And it'd be right. Zuzana, let's talk about something completely different, look. I'm not going anywhere, I'll stay here - in order to be still with you. - Dear!.. Tell me, how would you like - Zuzana Fabriciova? Isn't that beautiful? - How would you like three little Fabricios? From good old Willy, who's in love? It's dawn! Kiss me! Kiss me! Idiot! Get up! And grab the steering wheel! 190 years will pass quickly. Just like for me. What a stupid dream. It'll be worse in the oil. Look, Ms. Kovarova: the Big Dipper. Prepare the bill. I'm leaving. subtitles by kostej (2013)
