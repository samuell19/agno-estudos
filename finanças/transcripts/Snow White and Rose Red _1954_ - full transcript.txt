NARRATOR: This is the story of Snow White and Rose Red. There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage in the mountains. ln her garden were two rose trees, a white rose and a red rose. And the widow had two daughters, a fair one and a dark one. The fair one was called Snow White and the dark one was called Rose Red. Every day in summer, Snow White and Rose Red went off to the woods to pick berries for food. One day, they heard the notes of a hunting horn. lt sounded sad. And looking through the trees, they saw a young prince riding through the trees with two servants, and with him was a riderless horse. They wondered what had happened to the rider of that second horse. The long, slow days of summer passed and the winter was on the way. No longer did the girls go off into the woods but they stayed snugly by the fire in their little cottage. One night, there was a knock at the door. (KNOCKlNG) And a voice said, ''Do not be afraid. ''l shall not hurt you. l only want to warm myself at your fire. '' lt was a bear. Snow White and Rose Red made him welcome and brushed the snow off his coat and played with him. Their mother brought him some soup for his supper. The bear stayed with them that night and the next and the next, until the spring came. (BlRDS TWlTTERlNG) Then the bear told them that he must leave them. And he told them that he had a secret. He was not really a bear but a prince, and a wicked dwarf had put a spell on him and turned him into a bear. Now that spring had come, he must try to find the dwarf and make him change him back again. And so the bear went back to the woods. Suddenly, Snow White and Rose Red remembered the riderless horse and they knew then what had happened to the rider. (YELPlNG) Oh! Help! Help! l'm caught! Snow White and Rose Red ran to help the little man. And when they saw him, they knew at once that it was the wicked dwarf who had turned the prince into a bear. And they made him promise to turn him back again if they freed him. He promised and they cut him free. But he was a very wicked dwarf and he broke his promise. (SNlCKERlNG) l won't. l won't turn him back again. l won't, l won't! (LAUGHlNG EVlLLY) (SQUAWKlNG) Help! Help! l'm caught again! Help! Help! Help! lt was the dwarf again. This time, Snow White and Rose Red said they would not free him until he had turned the prince back. And just then, along came the bear. DWARF: Fair is dark and dark is fair. Come, my spell, from off that bear. Black is white and white is black. Let him have his kingdom back. And suddenly, there stood the young prince. But the dwarf was not even grateful to have been saved from this bird. He was furiously angry because he was made to undo his spell. And immediately, he tried to turn him back again. Dark is fair and fair is dark. On the prince l'll put my mark. White is black and black is... (STAMMERlNG) Oh! Oh, my beard! What have you done to my beard? All the dwarf's magic was in his beard and now that they had cut it so short, he no longer had any power to do evil. Off he ran, crying for his beard. My beard! My beard! Give me back my beard! My beard! My beard... And the prince, who had been a bear, fell in love with Snow White because she had saved him. (HORN BLOWlNG) lt was the prince's brother, still looking for him. They were overjoyed to see each other again. And Snow White married the prince and Rose Red married his brother. And as for the dwarf, he went deep down into the earth until his beard should grow again.
