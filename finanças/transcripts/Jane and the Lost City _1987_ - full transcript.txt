I don't like it one bit. - Shh. (uneasy music) - Tell, tell Churchill I've found the Lost City. It's...(grunting). - Where, Scott? Where is the Lost City? It's no good. (blowgun hissing) (dart thumping) (dramatic music) - I say, Rashleigh, have you seen this fantastic... (dramatic music) Oh, dash. (spear whistling) (spear whistling) (spear whistling) (spear whistling) (whimpering) - Prost! - Prost! (whimpering) (spear whistling) - Shit! (table crunching) Tell Churchill I've... (uneasy music) - (speaking in foreign language), what is that? (peaceful music) - Beautiful. Do you realize, Dr. Schell, that such a diamond could only have come from one place. - Yes, indeed, Fraulein Pagola. That is why I contacted the authorities immediately I returned. - Ah, so you must have known that this diamond could only have come from the Lost City, correct? - Well, I thought it possible, yes. But you see, my orders were-- - Orders? (pistol slide clicking) (bullet rattling) I give the orders. Once Herr Toifel has interrogated your prisoner you will return to Africa with us. - Interrogate? That isn't, uh, I'm afraid that will not be possible. - Not possible? Why? (pistol clicking) - When we docked in Lisbon, the prisoner, unfortunately, he escaped. - What? (pistol thumping) Who is responsible, you? - Me? No, him, Herr Muller! - Me? (fingers snapping) (whimpering) - It's not fair! A whole week and I haven't tortured anyone! I was so looking forward-- - Stop whining, Heinrich. Tell me what you found about those two Englishmen that were killed. - Both of them, agents. And I understand British intelligence are about to call in the Colonel. - What, him again? Those diamonds are worth millions. If the British get hold of them... The Colonel must be removed immediately! - For once I have anticipated you, Lola. A message has been sent to my brother Herman in London. Eliminate the Colonel and Jane. - Ah, yeah, Jane. We mustn't forget her. - Indeed, no. (lighthearted music) - All clear, Fritz, you can come out now. Good, we'll be just in time. (foot rasping) Fritz, where are you? (Fritz barking) Now how did you get in there? (knife blade clicking) (knife thumping) (groaning) (ship horn blowing) Keep still, Fritz. Stop moving about. - Ah, good evening, Jane. - Oh, good evening, Colonel. Been admiring the view? - Always find it fascinating. You know, the ships, coming and going, loading and unloading. Still, come along, mustn't be late. This is a very important briefing we're going to, Jane. - What's it all about? - Can't tell you. All I know is it's top secret and it could alter the whole course of the war. (lighthearted music) (foot rasping) Fine, I'll lead the way. - Uh, just a moment, sir. - Wonder what happened to those poor devils. - If you ask me, sir, you're going on board what was commonly known as a plague ship. - Rubbish, ha! Do you think so? (groaning) - Colonel! (fabric ripping) (Colonel clearing throat) - Well, one thing's for certain, you can't go to the meeting looking like that. Tombs. - Thank you, Tombs. You're a gentleman. - No, no, Miss, a servant is not allowed to be a gentleman. - Tombs. - Why don't I wait in the car, sir? - You better wait in the car, Tombs. - Yes sir, I shall wait in the car, sir. What a good idea, sir. - Come along, Jane. (lighthearted music) - Evening, sir. Thank you, sir. General Smythe-Paget is below, sir. - Well, you can spare the time, Captain, perhaps you care to show us the way? - Oh, yes, please, follow me. (lighthearted music) - Oh, do be careful, Miss. - Oh, right. Fritz? What's happened to Fritz? - Drowned, with any luck. (pistol slide clicking) - Fritz? (door thumping) (Herman grunting) (Herman screaming) (water splashing) (Fritz barking) Oh, there you are you stupid dog! (water splashing) - And what do you know about this Lost City? - Um, which one, sir? - Eh? Oh, the one in Africa where this race of warriors built their city. - Which no one has as yet found? - That's the place. Well, as you know, legend has it that hidden in that Lost City is a fabulous hoard of diamonds worth hundreds of millions. - Of course, being born in Africa you're probably familiar with the legend, Colonel. How this weird sect of Leopard Warriors came over from India in the 14th Century and they proceeded to build this enormous city in the jungle. - Dammit, Fawcett, the man does not want a history lesson, he knows all about the place! - Oh, quite. - Well, to cut a long story short, sent three chaps in, two killed, but now have evidence that these diamonds do exist. - We need those diamonds, Colonel. This great nation of ours is hard pressed, and alas the weapons of war, which we urgently need to stem the tide of Nazi aggression will have to be paid for. They do not come cheap. - How can I help, Mr. Prime Minister? - Oh, quite simple. You and you're charming assistant will go to Africa, you will find the diamonds, and you will persuade the Leopard Warriors to allow us to keep them. Ooh, it's getting damn chilly in here. Would you please close the porthole, my dear? - Right, sir. (metal clanking) (Herman screaming) (water splashing) - You, uh, did someone say two of our chaps were killed looking for this place, sir? - Third chap captured by the Germans. Luckily he escaped and came back here. You may have seen him as he left the ship. Poor fellow had the devil of a time. Completely lost his grip. - Not entirely. - Yes, I believe I did notice him. - Take off 0700 hours tomorrow morning, and landing here, airstrip near Abu Abu. - By simple process of deduction, the Lost City must be somewhere there. - I see. - I'm sorry to have to tell you, Colonel, but I'm afraid the Nazis are onto this. Their war machine needs diamonds just as much as we do. It is imperative that they do not fall into their hands! - Trust me, sir, this country will have those diamonds. - Good man. (angelic music) Well, my dear, the lights may have gone out all over Europe, but I'm sure that you will shortly illuminate the Dark Continent. (water splashing) - I couldn't believe it. To meet Mr. Churchill of all people, and to be dressed like this. (lighthearted music) I must go. Perhaps we'll meet again, Charles. - I do hope so, Jane. (metal thumping) (chain rattling) (Herman screaming) (water splashing) - Oh well, anchors aweigh. Still, no harm done. (lighthearted music) (bubbles gurgling) (airplane engines rumbling) - [Colonel] Wake up, Tombs! You sure you packed the salt tablets? - Yes sir. - Water purifier? - It's there, sir. - Hmm. Ah, what about my collapsible camp bed? - It's there as well, sir. - Are you absolutely sure? - I can see it from over here, sir. - Oh, he's bound to have forgotten something. (airplane engine rumbling) (people chattering) (speaking in foreign language) - Money, money, money, money. Money, money, money. - Out of my way, pig. (fist thumping) (fist thumping) (body crunching) (crowd applauding) - Heinrich, stabbing that piece of wood will not bring your brother back to life. - I know, I know. But just to throw his body into the river. They never even bothered to torture him. He would have liked that. Herman enjoyed pain. - He's dead, forget it. - But he was my favorite brother. Never once did he blame me for what I did to his foot when we were children. - I said, forget it. - [Carl] Lola! - Carl! (speaking in foreign language) Carl, darling, it's been a long time. - Berlin, 1936. You are as beautiful as ever. I see you are still smoking those awful Egyptian cigarettes. - But, of course. I like to live dangerously, darling. So, you got my cable then? - Abu Abu. That place is a hell hole, an old trading post. There's nothing there but an old broken down-- - Nevermind what it's like, can you get us there? - Is this coming with us? - Yeah, gentlemen, this is Carl Donner. And please be nice to Heinrich, otherwise he'll put a knife in your back. - So, why Abu Abu? - You've heard of the Lost City? - And the diamonds? Who hasn't? - Dr. Schell, here, is going to find them for us. Aren't you, Doctor? - Well, well, I think I have a good idea. - From looking at books? Listen, Lola, I am the greatest hunter in Africa. I will find that lost city for you. - And how are you going to do that, big man? - Simple. First I will find a witch doctor and ask questions. If he does not answer me I shall strangle him, then I shall find another witch doctor. Soon, somebody will tell. - [Lola] Good, when do we start? - Everything is arranged. You will be in Abu Abu tomorrow. - Splendid. I knew I could count on you. You do everything so perfectly. - There is one thing I should warn you about, Lola. The landing strip at Abu Abu is nothing but a flattened piece of dirt. However, not to worry, I am used to landing in such places. - I trust you completely, Carl. Oh, yeah, there is one thing you should know. The British are also after these diamonds. - Oh no, they're not, Lola. I have taken care of them. - How? - My brother Herman was a very good assassin, but my little brother, Hans, he is the best. An artist, a master. If Jane and the Colonel are not dead already, they will be very soon. Forget about them. (knife thumping) (Heinrich whining) (airplane engine rumbling) - I didn't know you were born in Africa, Colonel. - Yes, mother was out there at the same time. - How long did you live there. - Oh, must have been-- - Six months. - Is that all? - Yes, well, Africa gets into the blood pretty quickly, you know. We should be there soon. (door thumping) Ah, be landing shortly, will we? - Oh yes, Colonel, you will be landing in one minute. - Ah. (lighthearted music) Excuse. Tell me, Colonel, can you fly a plane? - Afraid not (chuckling). - Can anyone here fly a plane? Good. I dedicate this beautiful moment to the Fuhrer and to my beloved brother, Herman. Adios, dummkopfs. (whimpering) Heil Hitler. - My God, he's taken the last parachute! - Oh no, he hasn't, Colonel. He's taken your camp bed. (Herman screaming) - Wait a minute, if he's the pilot, who's flying the plane? (airplane engines whining) It's out of control! - [Tombs] Oh, blimey! - [Colonel] Hang on, Jane, just coming. - [Tombs] Colonel, you've got to do something! - Like what? - Well, where are the brakes? There's not even a steering wheel. I think I'm getting the hang of this. - What about the wheels? - Good thinking, Tombs. Must be one of these damn things. (engine sputtering) - Colonel, what have you done? - What, I, um. - [Tombs] He's only switched the bloody engines off, hasn't he? - [Jane] Look, there's land ahead! - [Colonel] I hope we can make it. - We're losing height too fast. - [Tombs] Be full of sharks down there. - Oh, shut up, Tombs. - It's no good, we're going to ditch. Hold on! - [Tombs] Shall I lay out your bathing costume, sir? (plane splashing) (dramatic music) (water gurgling) - We made it! - Good Lord, did we swim that far? Incredible! - It certainly is. I can't swim. - Well, what do we do now? - Make for Abu Abu. As I remember from the map, it's not too far from the coast. - Just how far, Colonel. - About, um, about that much. - Hadn't we better make a start? It'll be dark soon. - Right. - Right, come on, Fritz. Now then, which way, Colonel? - That way. (speaking in foreign language) - You're right, Carl, Abu Abu is a hell hole. - Yes, but soon you will smell the clean fresh air of the jungle. My jungle. (Heinrich crying) - Why are you crying, Heinrich? - I'm weeping for my brother, Hans. - That is Hans? - Ya. - He's not very big. - Nor would you be if you'd been thrown out of a plane at 10,000 feet. - How do you know that? - He was a witness to it all. Those English swines, they strapped him to the camp bed and just threw him out! - So, the Colonel and Jane are still alive. - But the plane was out of control, it would have crashed. - I wonder. (insects chirping) - If you ask me, we're lost. - No one is asking you. And don't go falling asleep, you're on watch. - You know, Colonel, all day I've had the strong feeling we were being followed. - Ah, (chuckling), imagination can play devilish tricks like that. - Pity we haven't seen anyone, though. - Ah well, it's late you see. They probably go to bed early. Not to worry, Jane, tomorrow we'll meet up with some friendly natives, they'll show us the way. It will all seem better in the morning. (lighthearted music) (moves into dramatic music) - Colonel, it is morning and it isn't any better. - If you ask me, that lot doesn't look too friendly. - Hey, that's quite enough of that. - Careful Jane, don't annoy them. - Magumbo! (dramatic music) Magumbo! Magumbo! 10 moons ago, you promised District Officer take no more slaves. You lied. (spear whistling) (spear cracking) (fist thumping) Anybody else? (natives mumbling) Pick him up and go. (native grunting) My name's Buck, Jack Buck. Most people call me Jungle Jack. - Me Jane. Ooh, that is a big one. - You ain't seen nothing yet, baby. Shh. - What is it. - I thought I heard a snake. - Where? - Shh. About 400 yards ahead, listen. It's okay, it's only a lizard. - I didn't hear a thing, just silence. - Jane, Africa's never silent. Look, all you have to do is close those pretty eyes of yours and listen, really listen. Go ahead, try it. (insects chirping) (elephant trumpeting) (hippo grunting) (lion growling) (chimpanzee cackling) - I heard it, all around us. - Yes, it's my Africa. (soft music) - Didn't hear a damn thing. How much further to your camp, Jack. - It's only another four miles, Colonel. There's one thing you haven't told me. What happened to your pilot after you ditched? - What? Oh yes, the pilot. - Uh, it was Miss Jane who was, you see, flying the plane, sir. - A lady aviator? Well, I'll be darned! Well you really are something, Jane. Come on, darling. - Look, I know he seems a decent enough chap, but we are on a secret mission. The less he knows the better. - [Jane] Come on, Colonel! - Did you tell Jane that mum's the word? - Yes sir. - Good. First class brandy. I'll say this chap certainly knows how to look after himself. - Hmm, well, he's one of them Americans, isn't he? Still, if you ask me, it ain't natural. - [Colonel] What isn't? - The way I see it is if the white man was meant to go traipsing all over Africa, he'd have been born black. - Rubbish, what about Gordon of Khartoum, Doctor, um, Doctor Livingston, all those fellows. - They're dead, ain't they? It's the heat that kills them, you know. Thins the blood. - Shut up! Drink your beer. - Yeah, I guess it was Hemingway. Oh sure, I read Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard as a kid, but that Hemingway. To feel the cool wind of the night and smell the smell of Africa. Ah, he knew exactly what he was talking about. And then (fingers snapping), like that it all happened. One day my daddy called me into his office and said, son, you ain't ready come into the airplane business yet. First, you got a lot of living to do. So he writes me a check and he said go see the world, then come back and take over (laughing). - So you came straight to Africa? - Yeah, that was about three years ago. Look, that's enough about me. Jane. - Yes, Jack? - I think there's something you ought to know. I was always come right to the point, straight from the shoulder. Now about you and this Colonel, are you, you two, uh, what I mean is. Let me put it to you this way-- - I work with him, I'm his assistant. - Oh God, that sure is one hell of a relief. (Jane laughing) What are you doing way out here? - Ah, well, that's rather a secret. - Ah, come on now, you can tell me. - Well, oh well, if you must know it's, uh, well, it's big game hunting. - What? - Oh, yes, the Colonel's a crack shot. - Wait a minute, Jane, what are you saying here? Britain is at war! That great little county of yours has got her back against the wall, what the hell you doing out here? You ought to be out there fightin' them damn Nazis, not out here killin' innocent animals! What kind of people are you? - Oh Jack, it's not like you think. There are reasons. - Yeah, sure, bunch of cowards. One thing I can't stand is a coward, man or woman! - Calm down, Jack! - Like hell I will! I should have let Magumbo keep you and eat you right down to the damn bone! - Well, to tell you the truth, I think the time has come to tell you the truth. - The Lost City, billions of diamonds, Nazi agents? Colonel, sir, you must think I was born yesterday. - For the umpteenth time, it's true! And keep your voice down. We don't want the whole world to know. - Jack, why do you think we're here? - I'll get all of you to Abu Abu, and then you're on your own. (engine sputtering) (Fritz whining) (uneasy music) Shh. - What's wrong? - We're coming into the territory of the Water Warriors. - Is that bad? - Very bad. - I don't think I like the way he said that. - We don't know much about them except they are killers. Okay, everybody, just keep your eyes peeled. (Fritz whining) - Jack. - [Jack] Yes, Jane? - I thought you'd like to know there's a crocodile right behind us. - Oh hell, Jane, I'm trying to start the engine. Why do you bother me with stupid things like that? You should be looking out for the Water Warriors. - Sorry. (boat engine sputtering) Go away! (oar thumping) (warrior grunting) - Oh my God. - Yeah, I guess that is a Water Warrior. It's alright, Mr. Tombs, just a lone scout. - I've got news for you. Some of his mates have come out to play. (dramatic music) - I suggest you get that outboard going. - I'm doing my best. (war drum thumping) Oh come on, baby, come on, talk to me! (warriors chattering) (arrow whistling) (arrow thumping) Come on, baby, come on! (arrow thumping) (Fritz whining) (war drum thumping) (speaking in foreign language) (spears whistling) (boat engine sputtering) - I suppose you have switched the fuel tap on? - Don't be stupid, of course I've switched, oh. (boat engine rumbling) (arrow whistling) - The river divides, which way? - Take a left up here, it's a shortcut. (war drum thumping) - They've given up. - Strange that they should all give up so easily. - The question is, why? - I think I've got the answer. (rapids roaring) - Oh damn, I knew I forgot something. (singing in foreign language) (monkey chittering) (Colonel sneezing) (Fritz whining) - Don't tell me, you took the shortcut? (men laughing) (money chittering) (soft music) - So. - Doctor, I say we should head west! - With respect, I think that is the wrong direction, Herr Donner. - They are here. - Who? - The Colonel and Jane. So much for their plane crashing. - They should both be dead! They will be dead. I will kill them, Lola. You must let me kill them, the honor of my family's at stake! I owe it to the memory of my two dead brothers. (Heinrich whimpering) - Quiet, you idiot! - Lola, he'll bungle it just the same way his brothers did. Let me handle it. - [Colonel] Come along, Tombs. - Quiet! Well, here we are, my dear. I'm in three, you're in four. - The first thing I need's a good hot shower. - Well, I intend getting my head down. - Ah, that is a good idea, sir. - Not you, Tombs. Miss Jane needs some decent clothing. There's bound to be a dress shop around somewhere. - A dress shop in a dump like Abu Abu? - Oh, anything would do, Tombs. Just so long as it's clean and dry. - Well, I'll see what I can do, Miss. - Thank you. I better give you my measurements. - No need, Miss. Your statistics is indelibly imprinted on my memory. - (chuckling) Well, don't stand there smirking, man, get on with it. - Perfect, they don't even realize we are here so they will not be on their guard. We can eliminate these British once and for all. - Good! First, I will kill that swine of a Colonel, and then-- - No! You will take care of the Colonel quietly with your hands. - You don't think I can do it? - You will take care of the girl. - What? But I want to kill both of them! - No! - Very well. I will just kill the girl, but beautifully. - Dr. Schell. - Me? - You will make sure that the servant Tombs is kept out of the way. - How will I do that? - Talk to him, buy him a drink, anything. - Oh, so I don't have to kill him? - You, you couldn't kill time. Right, the Colonel is in room three, and the girl in four. You both know what to do. I will take care of the other one. - To your health, sir. You are a true gentleman. You're right about women, though. They may look as if butter would melt in their mouths, but you can't trust them. Dogs you can trust, horses you can trust, but not women. - With a lion, you know exactly where you are. - True, true. Did I tell you about the grizzly? - Hmm? - Ah, a fearsome creature is the grizzly. Was up in Canada, I was, prospecting for gold in '21, or was it '22? Ah, no matter. (blissful music) (water splashing) (soap thumping) (lighthearted music) - Aren't you ready yet? - Don't you understand? I have to enjoy it. I am an artist, I have to savor every moment. - Just get with it! (fabric ripping) - You peasant! - What did you say? - Nothing, nothing. I am ready. - Good, just go, and don't you change your mind. (ominous music) (water splashing) (ominous music) (Heinrich giggling) (dramatic music) (Heinrich screaming) (cat screeching) - Excuse, is anyone sitting here? - I don't think so. - Would you care for a drink? - I always enjoy a beer chaser. - I was after opals, you see. Well, everyone was getting along famously, then suddenly out of the blue, this woman appeared. - Hello, what is your name, stranger? - Paddy Rafferty, ma'am, at your service. - Jack Buck, and you, you're a woman, ma'am. - Americans, you are so perceptive. (pill fizzing) And where do you come from, Jack? - Out there in the jungle. That's where I belong. - Hmm, a body like this, I bet you move like a leopard, sweetie. - I sure can. - Show me. - What? - Dance with me, darling. (waltzing music) - I'm getting dizzy. - You need some fresh air, darling? What the hell are you doing down here? - It was his fault, Lola! - Whose fault was it? - It was my fault, Lola. - Oh, nevermind, get this one outside quickly. We have to interrogate the American. Come on. (whimpering) - Then I remembered the story about the green-eyed yellow god, so I put the ruby back. Wisest thing I ever did in my life. Hey, did I tell you about how I discovered the Lost City? (dramatic music) - You found the Lost City? - Don't be daft. If he found it it wouldn't be lost. - It is only about 20 miles from here. - Where, where? - I wouldn't go back there for a million pounds. Barely got out with my life. And I wasn't even looking for the place. - Where is it? - Where is what? - The Lost City! - Ah, now, it is all years ago. Although I do remember there was this old volcano. Well, lad, isn't that the very place! - What is? What are you talking about? - The picture, that's the very volcano and that's the mountain. The Lost City is between the two of them. - Are you absolutely, 100% sure of this? - Absolutely, that's the place for sure. At least, I think it is. (head thumping) (glasses clinking) (fists thumping) (Jack grunting) - Nazi swine. - He's tough, most men would have broken by now. - (mumbling), you know nothing about torture. Every man has his achilles heel. You must let me work on him, Lola. - You're wasting your time, he doesn't know anything. - You're just saying that because you have failed. - I've found it, I've found it! - The Lost City? - Yes, yes, I know where it is! - Wunderbar! Gentlemen, we will leave at once. - But I haven't had my turn yet, I want to-- - Oh, listen, you incompetent creep! No, no, I am feeling good. Go on, enjoy yourself, Heinrich. - Thank you, Lola. (Heinrich giggling) (lighthearted music) (monkey chittering) - Mr. Tombs, wake up. Mr. Tombs, wake up! (Tombs groaning) Excuse me? - Any time, Missy. What'll you have? - Have you seen Mr. Buck, Jack Buck? - Oh, that American chap, yeah. He went off. - Off? Off where? - How do I know? One minute he was dancing with this dame, and then they went off together. And a real good looker too, you know. - I see. Thank you very much. - Uh, Miss? - Yes? - Anything you need, any time, just sort of whistle. (monkey shrieking) (dress ripping) (monkey chirping) (bartender whistling) (monkey laughing) (dramatic music) - Beautiful. So simple. The (speaking in foreign language) was an invention of my grandfather, you do understand how it works? - Dirty swine. - What? - Ow! (growling) - Nevermind, you'll soon get the point. (Heinrich giggling) Four candles to light you to bed. Four spears to chop off your head. - There's no other word for it, just damn bad manners. The least the fellow could have done was to say goodbye. Typical American. - Personally, I think we're better off without him. - What? I thought you were a bit sweet on the chap? - As far as I'm concerned, I hope I never see him again. - Really? Well, I'd better get this safari organized. Come on, Tombs. My God, look at the man. Oh, see what you can do with him, Jane. - Oh, oh, dear. What he needs is a pint of brandy and six raw eggs. - Thank you, but I think we'll try the black coffee first. (Tombs groaning) Mr. Tombs? - No. - Oh, come on, Tombs, drink up. - Oh, it's gone. - Just drink your coffee, you'll soon feel better. - Nazis, they've stolen the Lost City. It was there on the wall. - Yes, yes, along with all the pink elephants. (Fritz barking) Fritz, where have you been? Fritz? (lighthearted music) Fritz, come back here at once. (string snapping) (spear thumping) (dramatic music) (Fritz barking) Fritz, what's got into you? - [Jack] Jane? - Jack? Are you alone? What are you doing down there? - What the hell's it look like? Will you get me outta here? - Who did this to you, Jack? - Some dame called Lola Pagola. Will you just get me outta here? - Lola Pagola? Well don't you realize she's Hitler's most deadly agent? - Oh no! - Oh yes! She's evil, vicious, ruthless. She lures men on with her beauty and-- - Jane, will you just cut the biography. (string snapping) Ah! (spear thumping) - Jack, I can't open the door! - There's a way in through the top. For Pete's sake, Jane, will you hurry, will you hurry? (dramatic music) Hurry, Jane! (string snapping) (spear thumping) (Jack groaning) (dress ripping) Okay, I'll die happy. Jane, save yourself! - We'll make it. (string snapping) - Look out! (spear thumping) We made it! (lighthearted music) - Jack, I appreciate you're the expert on these matters, but don't you feel we're rather ill-equipped? - Listen to me, Colonel, I wanna get those guys. I'll be damned if a bunch of Nazis are gonna rough me up and get away with it! - But dear boy, we have no food, no equipment, no tents! - Ah, we don't need any of that! Travel fast, travel light, live off the land. - We don't even have a gun between us. - I don't believe in guns. - Well suppose we meet a lion? - Well, I tell you what you do, sir. You look at that big boy right in the eye and you out-stare him. Works every time. Well, hell, almost every time. - Almost? - Yeah, some lions are short sighted. - Oh. Great. - Think back, Tombs. Try to remember what was in that picture that was so important? - I'm not very well. It's all a bit of a blur, is last night. - Oh, don't worry, Tombs. It'll all come back to you. - That's what I'm afraid of. (lighthearted music) - Left a bit! - Halt! Think we stop here, yeah, Lola - Good. - Good. Fellas, up tents! Prepare the food, (speaking in foreign language)! (dishes clattering) - The crystal, be careful of my crystal! (Heinrich chuckling) - What do you find so funny, little man? - I'm laughing because I have finished the job you have failed to do. - What do you mean? - The Colonel and Jane are no more. With my genius for timing, I have left a little surprise for them at the Imperial Hotel. - You know, barman, there's something been worrying me about that wall. Oh, I know what it is. You're clock's stopped. And when you're ready, you can give me another double. (clock gonging) (explosion booming) (natives shouting) (monkey chittering) I think you better make that a single. (clock clattering) (insects chirping) (champagne fizzing) - Haven't you found it yet? - It is difficult. There are three extinct volcanoes marked on this map. - Dr. Schell, the one in the painting is clearly not extinct. - Yes, indeed. And in 1891, the exact date on the painting, Professor Kent, in his travels through Africa refers to feeling the ground tremble and seeing the volcano erupt. - So, then why the hell didn't you tell us about this thing before? (rifle booming) - Because Professor Kent neglected to mention which volcano it was. - You and your damn books! This means we will now have to investigate all three! - You should have listened to me, Lola. This man has been wasting our time. From now on, I will lead this expedition, and one thing I will not be needing is this! - It'll soon be dark. - Cheer up, Colonel. You'll feel better once we've eaten. - I'm starving! I wonder what Jack's managed to bag for the pot? Now that's a thought, fire. Tombs? - Why don't I make a fire, sir? - Good thinking, man. - [Jane] Managed to remember anything yet? - No, Miss, I'm too busy thinking about food. - [Jack] Well, hi there! - Ah! - We're in luck! We got ourselves a feast here. Yeah. (Fritz whining) - You call this a feast? - Jack, you said we'd be living off the land. - That's right, sir, but you gotta know the right places to look. - Oh my God, he's a ruddy vegetarian. (peaceful music) - Hi. - Hi. Jane. - Hmm? - I was just thinking about the other day. I'm sorry. - Sorry, what for? - Well, for doubting you and calling you yellow. - You weren't to know. - Oh hell, I shoulda known. First time I saw you I knew you were different. I was right. You saved my life. You're my kinda woman, Jane. - I'm glad. I've never met anyone like you, Jack. - [Colonel] Time we were moving on, don't you think? (lighthearted music) (faint speaking) Why have they left it behind? - It can only mean one thing. They know where to find the Lost City. - And so do I. It's all coming back. He said it was between the volcano and that mountain there. - Ah, all we need to do is follow them. I wonder how long ago they left. - That's easy enough to find out. I'll just see how cold these ashes are. (flesh sizzling) Ah, geez! - Or in other words, not long ago. (lighthearted music) - Look, this proves we must be on the right trail. This cigarette's Egyptian, and it's got lipstick on it. - Lola Pagola. We'll need to watch our step. Ah. - No sir, not up toward the mountains. - Why not? - You were about to fall for the oldest trick in the book. - Oh, was I? - Yes sir. If this woman is as clever as you say she is, then she's obviously laid a false trail. Now, my guess is she went right up this way. - What, through the forest? - Jack does know about these things. - Very well. And do keep up with us, Tombs. (lighthearted music) - So, it was the wrong volcano. I'm sorry! - Shut up! From now on, I shall lead this expedition. - Didn't I tell you he was all brawn and no brains, Lola? Not like you and me, huh? - And you can shut up too, you sycophantic psychopath. - Thank you, Lola! (lighthearted music) - Make sure you don't lose that painting, Mr. Tombs. (insects buzzing) - Be damned glad to get out of this forest. The place gives me the creeps. - Well once you get to know it, Colonel, the forest really is a friendly place. Stay close to me, Jane. Jane? Jane! (dramatic music) Leave her alone! Do what you want to me, but don't you hurt her! - Let go of me, let go! - I'll have you know I'm a Colonel in the British Army, and that woman is under my command and protection. (club thumping) - Here, you can't do that to my Colonel! (club thumping) - Get your hands off me! - Oh, I get it, single combat, huh? Alright, break out your bravest warrior! (club thumping) (groaning) - Jack! (dramatic music) (dress ripping) That does it! (fist thumping) - Oh! (queen gasping) Gosh, jolly glad I didn't meet you on the hockey field! (singing in foreign language) - Jack. Jack! What are they doing to Jane? - Oh my God, trail by poison! (queen laughing) - Are you sure? - Then after they kicked me out of Roedean I went up to Oxford, and what a wonderful time! Would still be there if my aunt and mommy hadn't chosen to both die at the same time. Well, of course, when that happened I had to pack it all in and come back. I mean, after all, one does have one's duty to do. - Oh, quite! - You say what you like, but I believe tradition is very important, don't you? - Absolutely. - Tell me, what was your first impression. I mean, how do you think I look as the Leopard Queen? - Oh, most impressive! Very regal! - Really? Oh, do have some more galoopa juice! - Oh, thank you! - Ooh, powerful stuff. Look, I hate to spoil the party and all that, but, um, well, what do you intend doing with them? - Well, of course in Auntie's time you'd all be dead by now. Well, she was a great stickler for privacy. Naturally, I'll have to punish them, but not quite sure how. Perhaps I could cut something off. (singing in foreign language) - But you can't possibly cut those off! - Why not? They do it to horses! (giggling) Oh, I'll think of something. And after all, I mean, fair play, they did come here to steal the diamonds. - Well, they weren't for us personally, you know. They wanted to borrow them for Britain's war effort. - Ah, you mean the Empire should rally to the flag? - Exactly! And while I think of it, there's a bunch of Nazis after those diamonds as well. - Halt! - Lola. - The river, that is the answer! If they built a city, they would build it near water. - A brilliant deduction! So, that is the right volcano. - I was right, look! (volcano rumbling) (natives shouting) - Come back! - You swine! (rifle booming) (rifle booming) (grunting) Shoot, damn you! (rifle booming) (dishes shattering) (singing in foreign language) - Blimey, Colonel, can you see what I can see! - Yes, yes, Tombs, we're fully aware we're in the Lost City. - And in the middle of their temple, so start praying. - No, I meant up there! Look at the volcano! - Oh, God, that's all we need. - Unfortunately, by the time Great-Great-Grandmother died, she was completely gaga. Took the secret with her to the grave. - So there are no diamonds? - Oh, yes, they're here all right, hidden somewhere in this damn temple. Only no one knows how to get at them. On and off we've been searching for the past hundred years. Oh, lucky the royal family always kept a few 'round for petty cash, but apart from those, the cupboard's bare, I'm afraid. (volcano rumbling) (natives screaming) Come back, my warriors! Are you men or children? (natives screaming) No! This is too much. Every time that bloody mountain starts to rumble they always trot off into the jungle. Well, they'll stay there for days, you know? And the point is nothing every happens. Oh, a couple of tremors, a bit of smoke, and it's all over. And to think, I gave up Freddy for all this! - [Jane] Who's Freddy? - A boy I met up at Oxford. Actually, he's an Arab prince. Oh, just to think of him makes me go weak at the knees. Oh, if only I could get back to England. (volcano rumbling) - I'll have you free in just a second, Colonel. (grunting) - No, Jack, she's a friend. - Oh. (volcano booming) - Oh, shit, it's really happening this time. - Oh, blimey, let's get out of here! - Stay where you are, Tombs! I promised Mr. Churchill that he'd have those diamonds, and I'm damned if I'm going to give up simply because some blasted volcano has chosen to erupt. - Well said, Colonel. (Fritz barking) - Fritz, where's Fritz? Oh, Fritz, she's too big for you! (Fritz whining) - Colonel, if you find these diamonds, you can have them for the duration of the war providing you get me back to England. - Why should you help us? - Very personal reasons. - Ma'am (chuckling), you've got yourself a deal. - We should be there very soon now, Lola. - You have been saying that for the last half hour. - Get up you lily-livered coward or I'll shoot you! - Shh! There is nothing, I can hear no more tremors. - Good, onward. (foot thumping) (Heinrich giggling) - [Jack] Alright, let's turn these big boys so they're all facing outward! (stone rasping) - Nothing - Well at least that ruddy volcano's stopped rumbling. - Oh, for heaven's sake, Tombs, just concentrate on the job in hand. - Let's keep our cool, Colonel. Finding the right combination is obviously gonna take a little time. - A little time? My people have been trying for the past hundred years. I did warn you. - Well hell, these statues weren't put here for nothing, right? That right, Colonel? - Right! - Jane? - Right. It's got to be here. (stone rumbling) - Jane, baby, you did it. (ominous music) (moves into triumphant music) - Light those torches, Jack. - Right. (fire crackling) (dramatic music) - My ancestors! - Ew. - Reminds me of my club. (uneasy music) - Want the diamonds, Colonel? (chest lid creaking) (volcano rumbling) - Time we got that out of here. - I quite agree, Colonel. But you must allow us to do it for you. All of you stand back! (rifle bolts clicking) No, on either side where I can see you! (volcano rumbling) Carl, get the chest. So, Colonel, you may have beaten me in the past, but you have lost the last battle. I always knew I could beat you in the end. - Don't you be too sure of that, Lola Pagola! - No, we're not done for yet! - But you soon will be this time! Remember my dead brothers, Lola. You must let me have them! (volcano rumbling) - Very well, but make it quick before you get buried alive. - How I will savor this moment! Oh, who shall I kill first? So many choices (giggling). And will it be the head or in the heart! Will it be slow and lingering. - I'm gonna rush that little twerp. - No, sir, I shall do it. Good bye, Colonel. - Stop speaking, down on your knees! You're dead! (dramatic music) (volcano rumbling) - My God, the entrance! - Nein! (Jack grunting) - Well, folks, I think we're in trouble. (volcano rumbling) Look out, Jane, behind you! (Jane screaming) Are you okay? - Sorry about that. - Hi there, Great Grandma. - Ah, that's it, no good. We're never gonna be able to lift that. (tapping on stone) - So, when we get out of here you're going back to England to find Freddy. - When, don't you mean if? - Who is this dear Freddy? - Oh, just someone I know. (lighthearted music) (Tombs grunting) - Any luck? - Solid rock, every inch of it. - Damn it, there's got to be a way out. - You don't give up easy, do ya, Colonel? - I'm British. - I wonder. - What? - Well, it's a silly story in my family that Great-Grandma was (grunting) terrified of being buried alive (grunting). - [Jane] I can imagine. - But, being a clever old bird (grunting), the story goes (grunting) she made arrangements to have another way out of her coffin, oh, for insurance. Just in case. It used to give us nightmares thinking that Great-Grandma might pop out of the ground at any time. Ooh! - Are you alright? - Jane, it's true! Great-Grandma did have another way out, come and see! - Careful, Jane. (volcano rumbling) (volcano booming) (uneasy music) - Let's take it easy folks. - Yes, one good cough and the lot could come down. (volcano rumbling) (Fritz whining) Must have gone for miles! - Come on, let's keep moving. (uneasy music) (volcano rumbling) (planks thumping) - That's done it. - Go, Colonel, get 'em out! (dramatic music) (Jack grunting) I can't hold it much longer. - Leap forward, Jack, throw yourself clear. - Okay, here goes! (stone rumbling) Run for your life! Jane, get the dog, come on! (group coughing) - Never, never thought we'd get out of there alive. - Oh, fresh air and freedom. (spears thumping) (dramatic music) (horse snorting) - Are these your people. - No, rather afraid they're not. - Freddy? Freddy! (triumphant music) - What the devil is going on? - Freddy came all the way back from England. Love, Colonel, love. - Oh, oh that. - Why didn't you ask that Freddy and his mob to help us track down them Nazis, Colonel? - Because, Tombs, this is an entirely British affair. Aided, of course, by our American ally. (airplane engine rumbling) - It's a plane! (dramatic music) - Aircraft is ready to take off, Fraulein Pagola. - Very well. Go. (groaning) (fingers snapping) (Heinrich hissing) (Schell whimpering) Once we are airborne, I wish to speak to Berlin. (airplane engine rumbling) Farewell, Africa, your treasure will be put to good use! (airplane engine rumbling) - I wonder just how much these diamonds really are worth? - A million billion Deutschmarks, maybe more. - Don't you get any ideas, little man. - Me? No, no, I was only asking. - I've just been on the radio. I spoke to the Fuhrer himself. - [All] Heil Hitler! - [Pilot] Heil Hitler! - Shut up and fly the damn plane! - What did our beloved Fuhrer have to say, Lola? - He, he was overcome with joy. When I described the diamonds to him, how many there were, he started to cry. - Our Fuhrer cried? - All great men cry. I am to tell you that he has awarded me two Iron Crosses, which he will personally present to me when I land. And Field Marshal Goering has ordered fighters to escort me back to Germany. Pour me schnapps, Carl. Success is mine. Oh yeah, I nearly forgot. Each one of you will receive a signed photograph of the Fuhrer. Prost! - I don't think I want to go to Germany. - No, we've got to do something. - And pretty damn fast, time's running out. - You know, there's only one thing I'm unhappy about, Lola. - What is that? - I would dearly have loved to have seen the Colonel and Jane die, slowly, slowly. - Right, that does it! (fist thumping) (Jack grunting) - Are you gonna give in, or am I gonna have to thump you first? - I surrender. (fist thumping) (Lola grunting) - I warn you, Colonel, my father was a policeman. - Yes, and your mother? - She's in the S.S. - So you want to play dirty, huh? - Anyway you want it, Colonel. - Well, this is a trick I learned on the playing fields of Eton. - We Germans know all about your English tricks! - Really, how 'bout this one? (knee thumping) - The old knee in the groin (groaning). - Oh, well played, sir. (grunting) (Fitz growling) (fist thumping) (Jack grunting) (fist thumping) (Jack grunting) - I'm wearing you down! (fist thumping) (Jack grunting) (Fritz barking) (dramatic music) - Ah! (Fritz growling) Whoa! - Good boy, Fritz. (Fritz growling) (pistol slide clicking) - Get up, get back. Hands up, all of you! (pistol booming) (pilot groaning) Hands up! - Get that dog away from me! - Look at him (laughing)! I don't believe it! (Heinrich laughing) - Carl, get down, you're making a fool of yourself. - Don't like little dogs. (Fritz growling) (Heinrich laughing) - The elephant and the mouse! Oh, look at your big strong hero now, Lola. (Heinrich laughing) - Carl, do as I say! - You don't understand! Little dogs, they hate me! (Heinrich laughing) (Fritz growling) - Little dogs, he's afraid of the doodle poodle! (door clicking) (Heinrich screaming) (airplane engine rumbling) - What are you doing, dummkopf! - He can't hear you, on account of you obviously just shot him. (airplane engines whining) - My God. - Now I'm gonna get at her. - No, Jane, no. - Good advice, Colonel. Anyone moves and they're dead! - Lola, please, wait for me. Shoot the dog! - Shoot the dog? (Fritz growling) (fist thumping) - Enough! Now you're going to die, you're all of you going to die! (dramatic msuic) - Help me, Lola! Lola, help me! (Lola screaming) (Heinrich screaming) - Another camp bed, Tombs? - No, Colonel, I'm afraid that was a parachute. - Pity. - Jack, where's Jack? - Where to, folks (triumphant music) (pleasant piano musiC) - Oh, Jack, do you have to go? - Yeah, I'm afraid so. That guy over there spent weeks looking for me all over Africa. - But right now? - Jane, listen to me. There's a lot of trouble brewing in the Pacific, and with my knowledge of the jungle, damn it, when Uncle Sam calls you just gotta go. - Come along, you two, time to celebrate. The diamonds are safely on their way to England. Mr. Churchill is delighted, and to show his gratitude he has awarded us 36 hours leave. - Oh no. - Oh yes. Well, that means that you two young lovebirds-- (Tombs clearing throat) Something wrong, Tombs? - Your brandy and soda, sir. - Ah, the rewards of the just, what? (chuckling) Did I say something to them? - No sir, I just think they wanted to be alone, sir. - Ah. Jolly nice tune you were playing just then. - I'll play it again, sir. (pleasant piano music) (pleasant music) - Will we ever meet again, Jack? - You're damn right. No war's gonna keep us apart. I'll be back. (dramatic music) (airplane engine rumbling) - You've got to go. Take care. (Heinrich giggling) (luggage thumping) Remember me, Jack! (dress ripping) - Just the way you are, sweetheart.
