I have lived inside this padded cell for four months now. Seems longer. But I can’t complain really, I’m still alive, still breathing, still kicking around. There’s not much to do in here really, it’s just me and this room. I was sent here, to this cell, four months ago. I was diagnosed with a mental disorder, I was sent here after I tried to commit suicide. I tried to commit suicide to stop the voices in my head, the nightmares. I wasn’t always a fucking nutcase, I was normal once. It all started out when I found this weird, spooky, demonic board. And showed photographs of me with demonic pausing. Now I was a bit silly and decided to play with the board, little did I know that board would open up the gates of hell. Beelzebub is coming. He's coming to fuck you up. Ezekiel twenty five seventeen. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. And I would see orbs and doors open and closing on their own and weird demonic beings walking along the hallways. And he will streak down with great vengeance and furious end to those who attempt to and poison and destroy his brothers. Hell opened up, haunted my home and my mind for quite some time. It was a demonic force that seemed to call itself Jengo. He began to take over my mind. It was a sort of demonic possession. A few months later I had a solution. Jengo’s a bastard. He’s a fucking bastard. And I had to live with him in my fucking head every fucking day. So I’d come up with a solution to get rid of him, something medical. Pills. I've become. Better. So I now have to consume all of these, all of these, all of these lovely, lovely, lovely Pills. You know what, I don’t even think my fucking girlfriend exists anymore. But we’ll find out. She’ll find me gone on the fucking sofa. Too many. Too many. Too many. And this is how I got sectioned in Broadmoor under the mental health act. And that’s how they started my treatment. My name is Doctor McKinley. You have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a case of schizophrenia. You will be undergoing treatment, here in Broadmoor, under my supervision. Your stay here is indefinite. So they wheeled me down this corridor and get me some help. They basically said I have schizophrenia, that all the chemicals in my fucking brain were all mixed up and all over the place. And some therapeutically shock place electric shock therapy. Something that isn’t there, but it could be so real. I had a sleepless night that first night. Jengo Hooper. Anyway. This Jengo killed my girlfriend and they think it was me, that’s why I’m in here. But things started out one night. It was a weird night. With a brilliant bright moon up in the sky. Run by my bed and I got into bed and I took some sleeping pills and I had a crazy nightmare, a very crazy nightmare. And I saw Jengo standing there and he told me I'd killed my girlfriend. And he told me I'd cut a some guys face off and used it as a mask. Some kind of identity. And this is, like, the exact dream that I had. You, Jake, really did kill your girlfriend. No I didn’t. She tried to help you, because you were sick, but you didn’t like her help so you killed her. This is your girlfriend Jake. Jakey, Jakey, oh Jakey. You better wake up. You better wake up. Because this has become a reality. Ah, Fuck, Shit! These fucking dreams are fucking... Oh fuck, these fucking are fucking killing me. I guess one of the main influences of my actions, aside from my mental illness, is the fact I always have this dream that sticks out in my mind, which is vivid and it always re, reoccurs . I dream that this woman dressed in black comes to my home. Hello. How long have you been here? A couple of hours. Cool. So where are you going then? Just upstairs to see my friends. Okay. Are you bored? Pretty much. And uses some chemical to knock out a policeman and she fucking butchers him. This dream is a nightmare. There is one bit that sticks in my head. It gets my blood going. It makes me want to reach out, and just reach out and get to her. So I try to get as close as I can. By doing the things I do. At least this woman is better to look at than the evil voice, the evil man in my head called Jengo. That reoccurring dream fuelled my desire to go out and butcher people and consume them in my kitchen. And I also filmed them as I fucking done it. You Fucker. I would saw their hands and legs off and put them in the oven, like you would a leg of lamb. I had a thing for eyeballs too. I’d carefully remove them and put them in a pot to boil or I would pickle them in a jar. Removing the human brain is a delicate process and it can take time, especially if you want to remove it in one piece for consumption. Murdered and tortured so many victims, I fed so many model citizens, all to the human cannibal. What the hell is that? I hang the body parts up in the bathroom to dry for later use. I had many uses for various body parts. I had to feel the evil cow on me. I had to get inside I had to feel the evil chemical on my body. So I decided to get in closer I decided to fuck it and fuck it hard. I needed to feel it, to be at one with it, eat it, it wasn’t enough I needed more. Do you know I'm so fucking crazy and looped up in my fucking mind that I filmed every little part of it. And when I finished I would save up all the blood from my victims in bags and I would bath myself in these bags of blood. It brings a whole new meaning to the word bloodbath. Seeing, seeing as I’m such a fucking monster I guess I had to, kind of, find a way to tell my girlfriend. So I thought of a way to do it without causing too much drama, you see. Hello Callie. I knew what I had to do, I had a plan. I just could not be the evil thing that I was, I could not live with this horrible disease in my mind, this mental illness, this psychotic thing that was living inside my mind, trying to take over, trying to make me this horrible, nasty thing called Jengo Hooper. I planned to just burn myself alive, burn my soul, burn the evidence, burn everything away and save everybody else in the future from the wrath of Jengo. I gathered my thoughts by the river, I needed to psych myself up, I guess, find that last bit of strength. I knew that my loved ones would miss me. But would they miss me when they knew the terrible things that I had done, the terrible things I’m capable of. If they knew what was inside my fucking head. The normal part of me was running away. I had this idea, this vision to just, just, just make everything go up in a blaze of smoke, a big explosion, the evidence gone. Bang! So I got home, got the gear on for one last time, the mask, I wanted to burn the mask and myself at the same time. But. I heard helicopters outside. Fuck, they were fucking on to me. Shit! I didn’t want to be Jengo at this time, I didn’t want to be Jengo Hooper no more, I just wanted to be Jake Weaver. But now I’ve got the fucking police outside, fucking helicopters, there’s fucking sirens, there’s fucking police cars and police vans. Fuck, what do I do. Shit. I thought to myself that I’ve got to get this done straightaway; I’ve got to do it quick. I’ve got to do it now. Fuck. Mr Weaver, it’s the police, we want to talk you about. I had visitors. Mr Weaver, we need to talk about the missing people in Woking Essex. Could you just please let us in or we’ll have to force ourselves. I didn’t know what the fuck to do. I fought the anger inside. The police entered. I don’t know what the fuck they were expecting. But my anger is burning inside and Jengo is coming to life. They fucked with the wrong man. I have to concur. I felt as though my body was actually falling apart. And my arms and legs and my chest would just fall open. I can see the monsters in the room. I can see them. Visit our snack bar, and treat yourself to some delicious Castlebury’s pit-cooked barbeque sandwiches, cooked the Castlebury way, slowly over open pits of glowing charcoal, then seasoned with a sauce that’s zesty yet delightfully mild to please the entire family. Speculation suggests that this is the work of a local man who the police believe to go by the name of Jengo. He is the main suspect in the recent events of the missing persons in Essex. Err Jengo is believed to have refused to co-operate with investigators earlier on today and has been on the run since. As police continue to search for answers fears grow for the safety of people in the local community. BBC news correspondent, Atjar Saheed is standing by, now Atjar what is the situation there now? Err Cassia, yes, just to recap from earlier, despite their best efforts police have been unable to apprehend the suspect Jengo terrorising the local residents and attacked officers at the scene. Err using, what police believe to be, a home-made grenade. Investigators are desperate to find this man as he’s an extremely violent individual and police are saying six missing people in Essex. You know, it’s just hard to believe that just one man can hold this. We've just had reports in that there’s been an explosion. I ran from the police, I had no idea what they would do. But then it all became clear. There was a man walking down the alleyway. I followed him. He was about the same height and build as me. So that would be perfect. I followed him going into the pub; I wandered in and watched him. What the fuck are you doing? Where the fuck are you? What the fuck happened to your face? After I that I put myself together and went back and followed that guy again. Soon he left for home, so I followed him home where I decided to break in at night, late at night and use the shock value to the rip the fucking skin off his face. I hacked him up. And slowly cut his head off. I completely stole his identity. I was cutting off the fucking face, he just plain and fucking took off, and I was in the fucking air. Heathrow air. I went to California where I planned to cross the Californian border and hide somewhere in Mexico. I had a long journey ahead of me and an eleven hour flight; I couldn’t wait to get there. I couldn’t wait to get my freedom to start and escape this shit, the scum and the bad things I’d done. I could not believe it. My plan worked and I'd made it. I was in California. And was set for a marvellous time. In California it was not long before I met my next two victims, Wanda and Shelly. Party girl. Two heavy cocaine addicts. Typical party girls. I love this song. You see I followed them for a while. I love coke. I could just not fucking resist this temptation, this opportunity right before me on that hot dessert. Fucking bitch, what the fuck is going on? What the fuck is this psychopath? Fucking, fucking ass bitch. Act like I don't... You want something from me you fucking bitch. Here don't say I didn't give you any thing god dammit. Here take a fucking coke hit. Fucking bitch. What the fuck is this psycho dude. What the fuck do you want? God damn it, oh my god, oh my god where the fuck does this come from? You see when you have fun time passes fast. Day quickly turned into night and I decided to enjoy my stay here with my two new friends. I'm hungry. I am hungry. I cut the one woman open so her guts fell out, I just could not resist taking a bite. I got bored, so I pulled her away and threw her fucking face into the scorching hot engine while I fucked her physically and mentally. Her face melted in the heat. No. No. Now it was on to the next one. She said she was pregnant. Oh pregnant. I found a great use for the hammer. I decided after all of this that I should leave and be on my merry little way. But also basically clean my self up a little. Meanwhile in London, my girlfriend Callie was wondering where the fuck I was, I mean, she didn’t know I was the other of the world causing mayhem and madness. Jakey, please come back; please let me know you’re alive. She waited, she waited and waited. And waited. Jakey I miss you. Please come back. Come on, want to go to my place. Yes? While I was in the Mojave Dessert I decided I needed a new drug, a new high, and a new weapon. And I began to trip. I found an old motel run by Mexicans a near the dessert and that’s where I stayed for the night. But my demons came with me and haunted me, banging, doors opening and closing. Memories of what I’d done flooding back. I went to bed. That’s when the nightmares started, this dark nightmare that I would commit suicide with a gun. But I know exactly what caused this; the demon is inside my head. I, I don’t know, my intellect tells me to reject that, but you never know. You see sometimes they place me in the white room. This is called the white room, it’s supposed to be relaxing and a chilled out place. And this is a good opportunity to tell you a little story, a fairytale, but it’s true, you see I like to wear masks, one like this, masks I’ve made myself, these are special ones, masks made from the skin of my victims. The are actually face of my victims; I cut it off and sewed it together. There mad. But they don’t allow them in here, oh no, but they do allow me, when I’ve been good for a week, they allow me, for good behaviour, to wear a special mask for one hour a day, they allow in this room in my padded cell and it’s a special mask, it’s a mask made from a nice new identity for the demon inside my head called Jengo. Anyway let me get back to the story. I found myself in Santa Monica. And look what I found, a new victim. Hey girl where are you at? I’m standing right over here. Oh I see you. I followed both of them into the apartment. Here you go baby cheers. I'm so excited to be here. Say no. What the hell are we going to do now? Let’s go to a strip club. No, I’ve never been to one. One! I know but... You know I'm going to need eight hundred of these. It's alright drink a bit. You've got all the time you need. I'm doing this because I love you. Your not taking my virginity there. But they better be hot! I need a boyfriend. But ok lets go get boy. I need to take some pictures. You want to take some pictures. Oh you have got to see the cloths I'm wearing. Alright beautiful. It’s only five blocks away man. Cool. Right there. Alright lets go get freshened up. You'll love it. Lets get every thing together and head on down there. Ok. Ok well let’s drink this beer, get your stuff together, you take your pictures... So I followed them to the beach and decided to make use of the venom in the syringe. She went on a trip. It’s Beelzebub, when he lays his vengeance upon you who can stand his fierce anger, look Who can survive the burning gift. His rage blazes forth like fire. And the mountains and dodgy ghettos crumble to dust in his presence. And troubled ones. Beelzebub will fuck you up. He has wiped out many dodgy hustlers just like you. He will promise those who participate in pagan worship. Get out of here. We've got to get out of here. We've got to get out of here! What happened? We've got to get out of here. I don’t see anything. Beelzebub is coming, he's coming to fuck you up. So the attack was on. After all the gruesome sick things I had done I found myself back at the cabin that I was hiding out at. Its here that I found myself in deep thought, deep regret. I drank to ease what I felt. I was so cold inside. The memories of loved ones rushed to my mind’s eye. What have I become my sweetest friend. What have I done. Just everyone I know just goes away in the end. I decided to rid myself of this monster, to keep it away from me. I left the cabin and I drove, I drove for miles and miles and miles across the desserts. Across America. I just kept on driving. Little did I know I’d have to use that dreaded mask again, I had to get back to the UK. I had to get back. Well now, someone was in London direct from Mexico to hunt me down, me, Jengo. It was Abersio. Hey what’s up? Yes dear I’m in London, I got here okay. I’m going to look for Jingo and get my revenge. Don’t call me, I’ll call you. Adios. Cut his tongue out for me. You see that woman I killed in the dessert, Shelley, was Abersio’s girlfriend and he And he wanted me dead. What the fuck are you doing here? Take me to Jengo. Take me to Jengo, now, come on. So the bastard had found me and the battle was on. I jumped on the car and caused it to go out of control. And slam crash and bang into a bollard. I pulled the Callie’s body out and this Abersio, but it was too late they were both dead. I decided to take part of Callie home with me, her face and skull so I could wear it and remember her by. I can’t believe I fucking killed her. Meanwhile all the way in Mexico Leila was sitting with Joy and few shots of cocaine and a glass of wine. She was having a wonderful marvellous time and then, well, the news was about to break about her poor little brother Abersio dying in a car accident, caused by me, Jengo. Yes. What? What? Fuck no. Fuck no. Abersio No. My brother, my blood. God he's dead. Leila went a little berserk and soon plotted and planned her revenge. As a bit cult building out there, a cult that Jengo built, a whole army of followers, a cult who fucking worshipped me as their god. They would hold rituals in my name. Now this cult had their own church, called the House of the Rising Sun, and they worshipped there every week and played back video tapes of the gruesome acts I did. The cult was led by a man who calls himself John, John the Disciple, and he believes he is the new prophet. This cult knew that a demon had possessed my mind; they believed I was the second coming of Satan. Jengo Hooper. Jengo Hooper. Jengo Hooper. Jengo Hooper, for all the things you mean to me I thank you. For the joy in my heart, the life in my spirit I give you thanks. Jengo Hooper, Lord, the leader of the Cult of Sins, you give me reason to live, you give my life meaning and every day is a treasure in which you encourage me to grow, you nudge me to enjoy every minute and the signs you give me to treasure. You dreams you send they guide me and your presence reassures me I’m not alone for that there are no words. The energy you give... Now John rewrote the Bible in my name, with me as their god. He sat for months just rewriting everything. He decided that that alone was enough, so he made a special sacrifice which changed his appearance and he used a special voice box to talk through. Strength by being there in the end. I must walk the difficult walk. In the end you can consume me the unthinkable. When I was safe I take comfort. People hurt you let me know you’re on my side your everything I will ever need. You’re my great cult leader for everything. My teacher to guide me in all knowledge my protector. When I am in danger and awake. Thank you. Above all Jengo you’re my safety, thank you Lord, thank you from the depths of my spirit, thank you for all that I am. You see John entices new members into the cult by hypnotising their minds. They think it’s just to butcher people and they robbed the graves of the dead as a sacrifice to their god, Jengo Hooper. Me.
