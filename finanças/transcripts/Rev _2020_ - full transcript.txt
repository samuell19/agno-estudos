- What's going on? You're late. - I'm here. Don't worry too much. It's gonna be okay. Okay... okay... I'll tell you what's wrong with this. It doesn't work. So I hold down the FN, I hit the F5... Computers. I thought they'd get me rich. Thought I'd create a killer app and retire before I was 20. Then get paid 200K a year giving bullshit talks about what it takes to be a success. Yeah, right. You know what I learned? No one truly succeds without friends on top. And you know who's on top of any business? Fuckin' thieves. The point is, you don't get rich by following the rules. You gotta take what's yours. ...the user mode, 'cause I'm a user, and that's why I think it's the graphics card, and I still have warranty on it. So you guys gotta fix it. Tsk. I'm just gonna go to the back and see if we have another one. Your ride is so sick, bro. It's so... sexy and shit, you know what I mean? I wish I had that. No, man. You shouldn't. I mean, what is that? That's nothing. What are we doing here? You should be fucking striving for something more, you know? Reaching for the fucking stars and not... not settling for what I have or what anybody else has. It's a simple life. No. You don't get it, man. - It was that one. - I see. - Thank you for your patience again. Sorry again. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have a great one. Cheers. What the heck, Mikey? Where'd you go? Smoke break. You left a customer waiting? What's wrong with you? That's the third customer complaint this week. D'you even want to be here? Mikey, hello! Hold on. I'm thinking. Get out. You know that moment in your life when everything is coming together, everything is clicking, it's all going according to plan? That's exactly the opposite of how I felt. Anyway, fuck it. I had a new plan. Rick. Maserati Rick, as we call him, is the first guy I ever stole a car for. Hey, Mikey. He runs Good Guys Motor Sports in the worst part of the city. If you want something done fast and cheap, Rick's your guy. If you want quality, you better look elsewhere. Look what happened. The fucking shift knob came off again. I must've threaded it three times and it keeps coming off. Listen, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. What's up, kid? I need cash. How come every time I see you, you're broke? I got expensive tastes. You shouldn't overextend yourself. Look, I was hoping that maybe I could help you cop a few cars. Sure. I like when you help me out, kid. No, look. I mean, like, a lot of cars. Like a lot, a lot. Okay, what are we talking about? One a week? How about one a day? Oh, come on, kid! I wish I could. - I can't move that many cars. - Why not? You know how it is. You need a fence, need a network. I just don't have those kinds of connections. Besides, I just make money from parts. Okay, look, why don't we try this? Let's do... two a week, and we'll take it from there. All right? Yeah. Okay. All right. I was 15 years old when I stole my first car. Me and my friend Donnie skipped school and spent the entire day looking for cars to steal. We'd just watched Gone in 60 Seconds. I got one message for society: If you don't want to encourage crime, stop making movies about it. The moment I saw that ugly, grey Toyota Corolla... I knew it was the one. Yo! I don't know why, but somehow, I knew that the keys would be in the glove box. But that wasn't the craziest thing I'd ever done. What are you doing? Stop! Can you believe I got away with it? What are you gonna do?! Well, you shouldn't. That was the first time I ever stole a police car. But it wouldn't be my last. Rick was in the market for certain types of cars. Evos, Subarus, Acuras, that type of thing. Or perhaps something like this. Forged rims? Check. Upgraded exhaust? Check. Boost gauges. Probably means there's a supercharger or a turbo installed. That's the ticket. Step one: Buy a slide hammer. Step two: blow the ignition and get the hell out of there. Step three: profit. How long have you been working on this thing? I'm still working out the kinks. Guess what I saw the other day? - What? - A 1965 Shelby GT Cobra. What? Not an original. Yeah. An original. Let me tell you, Mikey. You get me something like that, we can make some real money. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Are you serious? - Yeah, you interrupted me. I didn't count properly. One of the easiest ways to steal someone's car... is to simply take their keys while they're asleep. - What is it? - That is a 1965 Shelby GT Cobra. Just like in Bad Boys. - One or two? - What do you mean? Is the car from Bad Boys I or II? There's no Bad Boys I. There's a Bad Boys and a Bad Boys II. Look, we don't enumerate the first one, right? Whatever. It's probably a replica. No. I do my homework. So what do you want from me? What do you mean? You're gonna help me break into the place. No. No, no, no. Fuck that! I'm on... I'm on probation, man. - I'm not helping you break into shit... - Skittles, man. Do you know how much that car is worth? - I'll give you 10%. - No. Fifteen percent. Why are you gonna do this here, man? Why don't you just wait until he takes it out? Are you sh... That car hasn't moved from that spot in two weeks You don't just take a million dollar car and drive it around the city - and park it at a fuckin' grocery... - A million dollars? - Oh, shit. - More like 500 G's. You know what I mean, though, right? I'll retire in Miami. Just like in Bad Boys I. Fine. Here, this is for you. Wait... wait, wait, why don't I get the same one as yours? Man, that's all they had. Oh, my G... Have you ever broken into a house before? No, that's why I brought you along. This fuckin' stands out. - Well, do you have your own mask? - No. It's gonna look fine on you. You'll look great. Okay? Let's fucking go, man. Fuck, man. This is why I don't like doing work with fucking white people. Fuck this. - Come on. Let's go. - I can do it. Okay. Got it. I'll never understand why people leave their car keys near the front door. Might as well leave them in the car. All right. I'm out. - What? - That's it. I helped you get in. No, no, no, no, that's not it. I need you. For what?! - Push! - I'm fucking pushing. - Push harder! - Fuck you! All right? I'm pushing. Fuck. When you steal a high-end car, what you want to do is let it cool off in a public space and come back to it a week later. That way, if the car is being tracked, they won't be waiting for you when you return. - Don't fucking move! - Get your hands in the air! - Get out of the car! - Put your hands in the fucking air! So I guess the car was being tracked after all. You've got some nerve, stealing from me on Shabbat. Oh. That was yours? See, I didn't know, but, um... shalom, by the way. You want me to believe this was a coincidence? With your history of stealing cop cars? Who would have thought that a cop could afford an authentic Shelby Cobra, right? What do you guys make? Fuck, get me a job here. That was an inheritance from my father-in-law, you prick. He passed away last year. My condolences. Honestly. Evening, Mikey. I'm Detective Reid, from the Toronto Police auto squad. And it looks like you're being charged with grand theft auto of a 1965 Shelby GT Cobra, with a value well over $200,000. - Ooh! Nice car! - Thank you. Uh... let's see what else we've got. Ah... You're also being charged with home invasion. An indictable offense, which carries a maximum life sentence. Now, this sentence is rarely, if ever, enforced. But for you, Mikey? We're gonna make an exception. That was bullshit. This is no bullshit, Mikey. We're talking some serious, real time in prison. Yes, you can fight it. And we'll appeal. We can go back and forth, but trust me, we're going to do everything we can to make your life a living hell. And given your history? It shouldn't be that difficult. - Right? - Absolutely. All right, why do you guys have such a hard-on for me? 'Cause I stole from Moses over here? Listen, I didn't know, I swear to God. Maybe you didn't know. Maybe it was an honest mistake. What do you think, Officer Kovitz? Is there some kind of way that we can work something out? I might have some ideas. Their idea was for me to become an agent and infiltrate one of the biggest car theft rings in the city. They wanted me to steal a Lamborghini, which belonged to the ring leader, and bring it to a chop shop on 44th Street. Okay, bring it up, come on. Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Okay, look, just leave it there. - You Mikey? - Who else would I be? Look, I called him. He's gonna be here in about 30 minutes. You know the plan, right? - Yeah, they told me. - Okay, good. So... - How long have you known me for? - I don't know, two years? No, three. It says here three years. - Three years. - All right, three. - Fuck. - Yeah, three. What kind of cars do you steal from me? S-Class Mercedes, mostly. Uh, high-end luxury cars. Okay. Good, good, good, good. - Are you nervous? Don't be nervous. - I'm good, man. Okay, look, I see you've got a bit of an attitude. All right? Don't get cocky with Charlie. He doesn't like that. I just need this to go smooth, okay? - Just... be cool. - "Smoothly." - Huh? - You want this to go smoothly. Ok... uh, fuck. Hey, Charlie. Yeah, he's here, it's here... - You out front? Okay. - I'll come get you. Just hang on a minute. Okay, okay. Be there in five. Shit. I really need to go to the bathroom. - You might wanna put that away. - Huh? Oh, shit! Hi. See? I went over it, I gave it a full inspection. Everything is in tip-top shape. It's dirty. We'll wash it. - You better. - Everything. All right. So this is the guy. Yeah, this is Mikey. I told him it belonged to you. He-he... he didn't know. Is that true? Yeah. So how'd you do it? Roy told me you even disabled the LoJack. Basic, really. I used a radio hack to catch the wave signal when you were locking your car, and then just played it back to unlock the doors. A code grabber? Yeah, a RollJam. Go on. I plugged in a custom ECU in the diagnostic port, disabled the anti-theft, and then all I had to do after that was upload a pirate sofware. Who programmed the software? I did. You? What are you, some kind of engineer? Yeah, I know some code. Look, are we done here? I said I was sorry, I gave you back your car. Can I go now? You didn't say you were sorry. All right, well, I'm sorry. Roy! - Where'd you find this guy? - Oh, he... He stole my car two years ago. Three years ago. Keep in touch. - We good? Okay, good. - Yeah, we're happy. And just like that, I was in. You gotta admire a guy like Charlie. He was a hustler, a dreamer, a go-getter. Not even 30 yet, he had his own shop, warehouse and distribution network. Charlie had a small team of thieves. They were notorious for stealing high-end luxury vehicles throughout the GTA. Charlie's operation was like nothing I'd ever seen before. It was organized, proper, meticulous. During the day, it was the usual... Insurance claims, body repair, that kind of thing. But at night, that's when the real work began. All right, strip it down, boys. His crew could strip an entire X5 in under two hours. Fucking brilliant! Are you serious? That's-that's two guys this week. He wasn't doing a good job, Charlie. - Oh, God! You know he's suicidal. - Charlie? - What? - Sorry, Charlie. Um, the S-Class is here. Do you want me to bring it around? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. - S-Class. - Hey, Mikey. Get over here for a second. Have you met Ava? Hi. Ava, Mikey. Mikey, Ava. Yeah, I've seen him around. Look, I want you to be nice to Mikey. He's a smart kid. But I'm nice to everyone. Seriously. I wanna keep him around a while. Okay. Well... If you like him so much, Charlie, then why don't you invite him to your party tonight? Yeah? What party? Mikey! We're over here. Hi, Mikey. Is that for me? Uh, yeah, uh... I thought I should get you something. Happy birthday, man. Oh, my God! Look at this, huh? You see this? You see this?! It's character. Thank you. All right, let's get this party started! Have you got something for us, darling? I do! Come on, Mikey. What the fuck? Come here. You fucking monkey, come here! What do you see? - A great fucking job. - "A great fucking job." Fucking look at that panel! There's a massive gap. Who's that? It's my business partner, Sammy. Hey, Charlie! Sammy, you can't yell at them like that, man. We've talked about this. Oh, don't be such a pussy! Come here. - People take advantage of you. - Yeah, I know. - Who's this? - This is Mikey. Hi, nice to meet you. Customs pulled me over. I missed my connecting flight. Can you believe that? Why didn't you call me? What are you, my Mother? I was taking care of something. Sammy just got back from West Africa. Where did you go again? Zimbawe? Ghana, Charlie. Zimbabwe is in Southern Africa. Why don't you open a book sometime, you illiterate fucker? Sammy was a piece of shit thug who hated me from day one. He was the type of guy who wouldn't even piss on you if you were on fire. Move it! You can't park there! Hey! Can you move your car? - What? - Motherfucker! Fuck! This is it. - This is massive, Sammy. - Mm. Yeah. What do you expect? Guy's a fuckin' millionaire. I'm gonna take a piss. What's the deal with him? He's cool, man. How long have you known him for? Don't worry about Mikey. I trust him, just... Tell me about the deal. You know, not all thieves can be trusted, Charlie. How is it gonna work? We get a list every week. We steal the cars, we get them through Customs, they handle the shipping and delivery, we get paid. Simple as that. Okay, what's his name? No. We'll talk about it later. No, no, no, no. I wanna talk about it now. Who is he? I don't fucking know this guy. I'm vouching for Mikey. Tell me his fucking name! His name is Koflex. And let me tell you, Charlie, this is gonna change everything. He's got multiple buyers and they're all flush. Ministers, politicians, warlords. They all have very exotic tastes. Like what? Lamborghinis, Ferraris, McLarens, Jags. Everything, anything. It's not just a country, Charlie. It's an entire fucking region. All of West Africa. It's gonna be ours. How much are we talking about here? Fuckin' millions! You tell me you've never been in a threesome? - No, it's not really my... - What are you, some fucking Victorian nun? Ugh. Hey. Mikey. Boys... We're gonna be every insurance company's worst fucking nightmare! Fucking right! - Fuck 'em! - Fuck 'em! Mikey, I want you to know that you're part of something big. We're expanding the business. And I want you to be my right hand guy. Charlie, I don't know what to say, man, that's... - Don't say anything, man... - Charlie! What's up, Dutch? - Is that how you treat a friend? - What do you mean? - What do I mean? - Why don't you fuck off, Dutch, huh? - Koflex works with us now. - Shut the fuck up, Sammy! I expect this shit from you. But you? You go behind my back after all the fucking money that I made you? It's just business, Dutch. Come on. - Koflex was my contact. - Yeah? Well, he's ours now. So why don't you take your janky-ass chain - and get the fuck out of here? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sammy, Sammy, Sammy. Relax, okay? Hey, maybe we can work something out. Ain't shit to work out, bro. - Come on. - Look. Africa is mine. Don't worry about it, Sammy. We're gonna work it out, okay? I'm not worried. And you're goddamn right we're gonna work it out. I didn't sweat my balls off in that malaria-infested hellhole for nothing! Charlie? You see? That's what happens. That was the thing about Charlie. He loved that girl to death. Sammy. Sammy what? I don't know, I never got a last name. Tell me about this deal again. They wanna move 50 cars a month. Charlie put me in charge of exotic cars. Where? Africa? Yeah. Ghana. Okay. So who's the fence? His name is Koflex. A fence is a person who buys stolen goods and resells them. He's basically a sales rep, a middleman, a way for Charlie to get his stolen cars off the streets and onto the shores of Africa. - Yes. - Koflex. - Dutch. - Brother. Why are you working with them white boys? I need product, Dutch. My buyers don't care where it comes from. Yeah, but why wouldn't you ask me? Because I didn't think you can deliver. And who said that? Sammy? Those guys are fucking crooks! Look, you just tell me what you need, Koflex. All right. I need Ferraris. No problem. - Ten of them. - Sure. A month. Okay. My clients are not the kind of people you want to cross, Dutch. If you don't deliver, they'll give your wife to the soldiers. Just break your deal with those crackers, man. I'll get you the fucking cars. - I can't fucking believe this! - I told you. I told you that bastard was gonna fuck up our deal. - Sammy, we're gonna go talk to him. - No. I'm fucking done talking, Charlie. You can't reason with these roaches. They gotta learn to stay out of our business. Jesus, Sammy! We're not gonna kill the fuck. Intimidation, Charlie. Here. Are you part of this or not? Dutch! Get out here, you cunt! Back off. Dutch! Have a seat. Couldn't keep your nose out of my fucking business, could you, Dutch? It was my business to begin with. Yeah. - Hey, Charlie... - Hmm? See that drill over there? Be a dear and hand it to me, please. The fuck's he gonna do with that shit? You can't fuck with us. Yes, Dutch. Koflex, I can't get you the cars anymore. Why not? It turns out I have a bit of a... health problem. - I'm sorry to hear that, Dutch. - I've thought about it and... I think you're better off with Charlie and Sammy. Okay. Feel better. In Sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia, the demand for high-end cars was booming... driven by cash-rich drug dealers, corrupt politicians and egotistical warlords. A brand new McLaren was the ultimate status symbol. Most companies don't even set up shop in this part of the world. So if you want the latest Porsche GT3 or Benz, you have to import it. That's where we come in. Why spend 400K on a brand new Hurricane when you can get the same car for half the price? Charlie's operation ran like clockwork. Koflex sent us a list of in-demand cars and we stole every single one of them. There are many ways to steal a car. The simplest being a good, old-fashioned carjacking... which I was never a fan of. I'll fucking shoot you! Get the fuck out! There were dealership scams, where we would ask for a test drive, snap a photo of the keys, and create a replica later. Then another one of us would come back, pretending to be a customer, and swap the keys. By the time the dealer realized they now had a fake set, the car was already in Charlie's warehouse. We even had people in the MTO, who got us duplicate plates that matched the exact make, model and color of the cars we stole. So if a cop ever spotted a runner and ran the plates, everything checked out. Here you go, sir. Have a great day. And then, there was my specialty. Hacking the car's anti-theft system, driving it underground, where it became invisible to satellites, and taking my time to disable the tracking device. Next came retagging. We'd forge new VIN numbers, vehicle history and titles. We had folders full of fake customs documents, manifests, everything you'd need to make a car disappear. Koflex couldn't be happier. Anything he wanted, Charlie delivered. We were moving nearly $1 million's worth of cars a month. If you're wondering what kind of lifestyle that affords... it's a great one. Hey, Mikey. Pass me the towel? - Sammy. - Hey. I'd like to talk to you for a moment. Right now? Right now. All right. Oh, Sammy... Did you look into it yet? Not yet, not yet. I need to know soon, Sammy. I can't waste any more time. I know. I know. I'm working on it. My buyers want to move on this as soon as possible. If you can't deliver, let me know now. Don't drag this out. I can deliver. I just need a little time. Give me until next week. Hmm. Next week. You know... Charlie really likes you, Mikey. Yeah, I like him too. As a friend, of course. He's all yours. But... seriously. He really trusts you. Yeah, I know. We'll have to be careful. Boo! Hey, have you guys seen Sammy? - Uh, no. - Tsk. He's always running off, that Sammy. He's like the fucking Road Runner, you know? Can you pass me that magazine, love? Can you believe this? This is what she reads. Drifting. Honestly, you see a girl like this... A car magazine is the last thing you expect her to be reading, right? Why don't you just be honest with yourself, Charlie, and admit that you hate drifting and you hate drift cars? - I do. I do, I hate them! - Why? Sliding around, burning tires. It's a stupid waste of money. No, I disagree. No, drifting is... It's graceful. It's like dancing. You know, you have to improvise every single time you miss a step. It's... chaotic, but precise. It's... it's poetry in motion. Thank you. I actually run laps at the track sometimes. You guys should come. I'm not gonna watch you waste a nice set of tires. I'll come. Mikey... I'm telling you. She can come watch, but don't let her get behind the wheel. She sucks. Boost gauge. Oil temperature. Speed. Start off with the clutch kick like we talked about. You can come into the turn at any speed that way. It'll help you build our confidence. Nice and slow, okay? She's fucking incredible! Yeah. Is she your girl? Yeah. There's nothing to eat in here. Well, I've been busy. I'd been busy all right. Between talking to the cops, keeping Sammy off my back and stealing for Charlie, I had a lot on my plate. This was the last thing I neeeded. But that ass, though... I'm hungry. Are you ready to go? - Fuck. - What? It's Sammy. One second. Relax. We-we just had breakfast. Well, well. What are you two doing here? We just had breakfast. We were actually just on our way to the scrapyard, - to get the new VIN numbers. - Is that a fact? Hmm. What are you doing here, Sammy? Are you working with Dutch again? Dutch? No. We're just having breakfast. Well, enjoy. We will see you later, Sammy. You know, Charlie... He's not really a breakfast guy. Why don't we keep this place our little secret? We wouldn't want him to feel left out. Where were we? I'm not helping you, Sammy. And I'm not asking for your help. I'm asking for your collaboration. Those are two different things. There's good money to be made here. Can you do it or not, huh? - Can I do it? - Yeah. The cars? That's your thing. I admit that. But this is my territory. How do I know you won't fuck me? You get your money upfront. No funny business. You know the drill. You better know what you're fucking doing, man. These guys know all the tricks. They know where to look. You can't just ship the product like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck, he whines like a woman. Just get back to me when you have a number, okay? And what about your partner? Charlie? He'll come around. - Hello? - Where the fuck are you? I'm taking the Jag to the yard, just like you said. Oh, like I said. You were supposed to be there two fucking hours ago! You missed the shipment! Now I gotta pay for an extra week of storage. - I'm so sorry, Charlie... - You're sorry, I'm sorry, everybody's sorry. First, Ava takes the day off out of the fucking blue, then Sammy disappears, like he always does, and now you! - I got tied up. - Oh, you're tied up?! I feel like I'm running this entire operation by myself! Well, what can I do? Just get the car over there and tell Gordie to store it for the next shipment. Whatever you want. Whatever you want, Charlie. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice, if I was better off keeping my day job. I'd be home right now, playing videogames instead of living in one. At least then, I'd be able to turn it off. What else did you see? Nothing, all right? That's it. Just Sammy, Koflex and the drugs. And Dutch was there too. No! What would he be doing there? But you did see him earlier. Yeah, I did. At breakfast, with Sammy. - Are you guys following me? - Of course! Tell us more about the drugs. What was it? Meth? Coke? - Heroin? - Man, I don't know. All right? I don't know anything about drugs. Listen, I am done with this shit. - This is not what I signed up for. - No, you're not. Look at me. You are an agent. You work for us. But I gave you everything that you wanted, all right? I don't know anything else. This is it, this is the operation. Just go in there and bust them already. What you saw today was the operation. That's what we have been waiting for. You think we give a fuck about a car theft ring? Your buddies Charlie and Sammy are working with an international drug smuggler. No. Not Charlie. - Yes. Charlie. - No. All right? I know him. He wouldn't get involved with something like this. You just keep your eyes open. Are you crazy? I can't go back in there, all right? Sammy saw me! That guy is a fucking psychopath! He drills people's dicks, for Christ's sake! So? You saw him with a little bit of coke. So what? You're Charlie's boy, aren't you? He won't let anything happen to you. I want out. All right? I want out. I've had enough. All I did was steal a fucking car. I want to show you something. I got this thing off of eBay, and it is amazing! The pictures, so clear. Now, I'm not a professional and I barely know how to use it, but I am learning. Oh... See? That's my cat, Callie. Oh, so cute! And that, that one's a bird. Don't know how I took it. Oh, but these... I'm so proud of these. It's a sunset. So beautiful... Check these out. Mm. Heh. Why are you following me? Yes, you are. Don't fucking lie to me. I saw you at the container yard. Yeah, I was delivering a car for Charlie. What did you see? Nothing. Just you and Koflex in the office. What else? You know, I don't like you, Mikey. Not one little bit. But Charlie does. It'd be a shame if something were to change his mind. You know what I mean? I found these on my way in. You might want to give these back to Ava. I'm coming! What? Hey. What's up, Charlie? Get your shit. Let's go. Where are we going? Don't ask questions. Just hurry the fuck up. Yeah. So what are we doing here, Charlie? What's going on? You know, Sammy always told me I was... too soft, that I trust a little too easily. And you know what? Maybe... Maybe he was right all along. So what's happening? What's the problem? Why don't you tell us what the problem is, Michael? I don't know what you mean. Yes, you do. Sammy told me everything. I just want to hear it from you. - What do you want me to say? - I want you to tell me the truth. You've been going behind my back. What? Think I wasn't gonna find out, huh? Charlie, man, I am so sorry, okay? - I mean... - What are you sorry for, Mikey? I'll show you what he's sorry for. - What the fuck is that? - Oh, that? That is Sammy and Mikey's new business. At least Sammy had the balls to come clean. How long were you gonna keep this a secret from me? Charlie, look, I don't know... I don't think I can ever trust you again, Mikey. Whatever it is you guys got going on with Koflex, count me out. Ava, let's get the fuck out of here. You can't do that, Charlie. What? I said you can't do that. You threatening me, Sammy? No. It's not me you should be worried about. - No? - No. Who should I be worried about, then? Well... the African fucking warlords, brother. Who do you think we're dealing with here, huh? What the fuck have you gotten us into, Sammy? You wanted to expand. Remember? We were gonna take over the world, you and me. Not like this. Listen... If we don't give Koflex what he wants, it's gonna cost us a lot more than money. You feel me? You've been planning this since Africa, haven't you? Yeah. Motherfuckers. Both of you. - Charlie, come on! - Shut the fuck up, okay, Sammy? You're acting soft again! We're gonna figure this out. I should have seen this coming. That deal? Too good to be true. It's not your fault. You only see the best in people. I'm gonna go to the store. You need anything? - No, I'm okay. Thanks. - Okay. I can't believe you, Mikey. - Who do you think you are? - Are you serious? I can't believe that you actually... - You fucking lied to us! - You don't understand. I had nothing to do with this. Sammy is setting me up. That's bullshit! You knew about the fuckin' drugs! Yeah, I did. I knew about the drugs. But I'm not involved. - I caught Sammy and Koflax making plans. - Okay... I caught them making plans, all right? Then why didn't you say something? - Because! - Why didn't you tell Charlie? 'Cause Sammy knows about us. What? After I caught him, he broke in and he found these. Fuck. What are we gonna do? I don't know. All right, okay. I'll think of something. Yeah, you better. But there wasn't much to think about. Sammy had us all cornered. I was walking a tightrope. Drug smuggling, African warlords, federal fucking agents... What the fuck was I thinking? I wish I had gone to prison. What is all this? This is the mess you and Pablo fucking Junior over there got me into. Hey, partner. So... what do you think? Where are you gonna put all this, Sammy? Where? Everywhere! I'll put it in the seats, the floors, the panels, the roof. Fuck it! We'll put it in the goddamn engine block. Jesus Christ. Be honest with me. She's a freak in the bedroom, isn't she? Good for you. I wish I was a polygamist so I could marry each and every one of you ladies. Welcome, Michael. This is Michael Braley, our man inside, everyone. Have a seat. Get the lights, please. This is Koflex Odemene. A Nigerian-born refugee, and former member of LRA, Lord's Resistance Army of Uganda. He's a reputed drug smuggler, and international arms dealer. Koflex is working with this man. Sammy Olinsky, one of the partners of a global car theft ring, involved in hundreds of stolen exotic and high-end luxury vehicles being shipped to several countries in West Africa. This is Charlie Rivera. Any luxury car stolen in the GTA can be traced back to this man. We have intel that these men are set to make the largest shipment of narcotics that this department has ever seen. We believe the group will use several high-end vehicles to conceal the shipment. The cars will be loaded into shipping containers and will await transport at this location. Now I will hand it over to Squad Leader Sgt. Davidson who will walk us through the sting operation. Sgt. Davidson. Thank you, Detective. A week from now, we'll be executing a search warrant for Det. Reid at Koflex's shipping yard. It will be a night raid set for 0100 hours. We'll be entering onto the property in three teams... one from the north, one from the west and one from the east. Uniformed officers will stage here, while K-9 and Air 2 will be on stand-by in case we have a runner. Detective Reid will provide us the green light as soon as the shipment and the targets are verified on scene. If you have any questions, please refer to your handouts. - Officer Diaz. - Yeah. What's with the south wing? South wing is a dead zone. Containers here are about 40 ft. high, there's no chance of escape. We've verified there is no contraband and those containers are not moving any time soon. Trust me, these guys are smart. They're not gonna get caught in this area. Got it? All right. Let's talk tactics. Scared now, Mikey? I can explain. You turn us all in, you save your own ass? - Is that the idea? - You're gonna have to trust me, okay, Ava? It's a little late for that. - What are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing? - I'm calling Charlie. - No, no, wait a second. Wait a second. Charlie might have given you a second chance. But I won't. I'm a cop. - Hello? - Charlie. Yeah? I need to tell you something. - What's up? - We're out of milk. - Uh... okay. - Can you get some on your way home? Sure, I guess. They forced me to do it. - You bastard. - I didn't have a choice. There's always a choice, Mikey. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you or Charlie. - Okay? - I don't believe you. Well, you're gonna have to. All right? If any of this gets out, then we're all fucked. Just give me some time, please. Just a little bit of time. I'll figure this out. You better fucking know what you're doing. Fuck! What is this? That is our way out. It's a dead end. Police aren't covering it. Wait, if it's a dead end, where's the fucking way out? That's where you come in. You're gonna go to the container yard and you're gonna talk to Gordie. - Who? - Gordie. He's one of the loaders Charlie deals with. - Gordie! - You'll recognize him right away. He's kind of slow, he has these huge bifocals, - and he's always asking... - What's that? I need you to remove all the contents from container 30994. Thank you very much! After that, you're gonna get him to empty the entire container. When he's done, you go in and you get to work. You're gonna cut every single lock on both sides. And that's it? No. Before you do any of that, you have to go to this address. It's a costume shop. You're gonna ask for Laszlo. He's gonna give you a uniform for Gordie. Why me? Why aren't you doing this? 'Cause I'm working a 12-hour day. I can't get away from Sammy and Charlie, and even if I could, the cops are watching me. If I'm spotted even once in that container yard, then it's game over. I'm only doing this for Charlie. If he gets hurt... - Isaiah. - Detective. See if you can get me some background on that suspect. Will do. Let me find him. - Hey. - Hey. One of Koflex's guys was just arrested in a DUI. - That's good for us, right? - No. We've got a problem. They found these in his car. - Damn! - I know. All right. Take it. That's it, boys That's the last of it. What now? Now? Now we get paid. Let me call Koflex, tell him we're on our way. Koflex? Sammy here. We're all done. When do you want to meet us at the container yards? There's still lots of time, Sammy. Let's meet at the club first. - The club? - Yeah. Oh, and Sammy? Bring the entire crew as well. Ahem. All right. So what did he say? He wants to meet us at the club. - At the club? - It's fun. It's fine. How come you're not dancing? I don't feel like it, Charlie. What the fuck are we even doing here? That's a good question! What are we doing here, Sammy? There's nothing to worry about. He's a businessman. I'm sure he's got a reason. I gotta go to the washroom. I'll be back. Come on... Come on... Damn it, where are you? - What? - Mikey! Where the hell have you been? I've been trying to reach you. We're at the club. Koflex wants to meet us here. What the hell is going on? Mikey, get the fuck out of there. I can't, everyone's here. What... - What about the shipment? - Forget about the shipment. Koflex knows. What? Koflex knows that you're an agent. Get out of there. Now! You shouldn't drink so much, bro. You gotta pace yourself. That... that's fucking gross, man. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, buddy, hey! Uh, look... Look, there's been a change of plans. - What plans? - What... what plan? The plan that we talked about. - Huh? - Okay, listen to me. I need you to write down this address, okay? 87 Darcy Street. Okay. Back home, when I was in the war... I had a commander. He loved Shakespeare. Julius Caesar was his favorite. "For let the gods so speed me as I love the name of honor - more than I fear death." - Cheers! Samuel, do you remember when we met in Ghana? What I told you when you asked to work with me? Ah, Mikey, Mikey. Perfect timing. Sit down. You don't want to miss this story. I was just telling your friends the first time I met Sammy. So... Do you remember what I told you? No. You're kind of freaking me out, man. Ah, there's no reason to be freaked out now. Come on! I'm just fucking with you. We're here to celebrate, are we not? To Sammy. May you rot in hell. What the fuck?! I know you're working with the police. What the fuck are you talking about? We caught Mikey and your whore of a girlfriend - outside the police station. - No, no, no, no, no! No, Charlie had nothing to do with it, all right? It was just me. Charlie, it's not what you think. He was trying to save you. SWAT! Drop it! Michael Braley. Identify yourself. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here! Folks, this way, please. Keep it moving. Fuck! You think this is a fucking joke? - What? - Where the hell is he, Mikey? - Who? - Your pal, Charlie. We know that you were trying to help him escape. Wow. - He escaped? - Yeah. He escaped. Where'd he go? - You fucking... - Jesus Christ, Jennie! I was reaching for the stars. What the fuck happened? I really thought he was gonna save us. Us? Come on, Mikey. We know you snuck back into the yard, we know you had plans to help Charlie. Just tell us where they went. We also know about your lover, Ava, cutting locks in the container. So stop fucking around and tell us where they went! What the fuck do you want from me? Huh? I almost died today. And how the hell did Koflex know that I was an agent, huh? And if I had died, who'd have been responsible? You? You? Who cares about the punk car thief as long as we get what we want, huh? Shit! Finally! We're freezing back here! Officer, you think we could get some heat? Yo! Turn on the heat! What's that? - Gordie?! - Buckle up, Charlie! Fuck. Okay. - Mikey? - What? Don't leave town. I won't. You know we're gonna have to start all over, right? Where are we going? Why don't you ask the captain? So where are we going, Mikey? It's a surprise. Somewhere warm, I hope. You ever seen Bad Boys? One or two?
