Stretch it, boy! Just a second.. That's not how you hold your arm! Hold it like that! And like that! Keep your head up! Well done! The more you listen to your father, the better! Do we have any food, my son? Some leeks. Good, good. Go to Sirbiladze's house and tell him that we, are having a feast and that I won't start without him. Tell him to bring a jug of wine with him... Remember, we still owe him two jugs of wine... Well this one will make it three then.. Fine, I'll go and bring Aristo and watch you being embarrassed. Don't you worry! I won't be embarrassed. Tell him to fetch some maize-bread and cheese and a chicken in garlic sauce... And tell him we have some leeks... Girl, those eyes of yours Are my favorites From whatever direction the wind blows I will shelter you You Bregvadzes have the best feasts! I'll leave if you hate me I will leave you But your love will melt me I will wither Mizana! Mizana He's sleeping the big sleep! What sleep? He has bitten the dust! What dust? He has kicked the bucket! Which bucket? He has died... he's dead... and he took my three jugs of wine to heaven! Look at his long legs, father! He should shoulder his father's debts now, before he legs it It's shameful to say things like that... Don't be angry with us, my son.. But this is the custom. You must pay your father's debts, Just like your father, Mizana, paid his father's, remember? Yes, we do! Your debts will pass to your son His debts to his children and grandchildren This is how it goes... I can't believe that we, the Bregvadzes, cannot afford to pay our debts! Since he's in such a mood, read the list of debts! You'll burn in hell for being so greedy! You owe our church two candles but you're forgiven. We'll light three candles for your father for Christmas. Mizana Bregvadze owes Aristo Sirbiladze one pot of kidney beans half a kilo of cheese one chicken one bunch of radishes four maize-breads and three jugs of wine. Now watch me! Take it... Who's next? Mizana borrowed some millet from Dorotea Vachiberidze, half a chicken, three eggs of the aforementioned chicken... The rest of you must trust me. I	have nothing else to give! You paid for almost everything Wait a bit and I will pay you all. What do I owe you? Your late father bashed the neighbour with my drum and promised to replace it. You owe me a skin of wine. It wasn't you, but somebody lost my felt cloak and headdress and I want it back. Read it out loud, father. Mizana Bregvadze lost three songs to a bet against Ghvtishobela Kupatadze: "Chito Gvrito" "I hug your swan-like neck" and "Alipasha betrayed us" Shall I sing? Forget those two, but sing me Chito-Gvrito if you'll ever be in the mood He's asleep Ertaoz, get up. The sun has risen. Good morning, Uncle Isidore Good morning, and take this. It's pot of honey. Your father gave it to me before you were born, and he has never mentioned it since... You really shouldn't have... I know what I'm doing. Go to market next week sell this honey and buy a hen. It's better to buy a black one. This hen will give you chicks. Then you'll sell them and buy a piglet. It will turn into a pig and will give you piglets. I'll sell them and pay all my debts, right? Yes, but don't put all your eggs in one basket! I won't. Good-bye! And stay away from those phaetons! They're an invention of the Devil. Get moving, Triphon! Don't be late! And come back soon! Margalita, from now on you're the mistress and the master of this house. I'll manage, don't worry. Sell apples in town and buy walnuts. Sell walnuts and buy some potatoes and melons. Gosh, Triphon, aren't you forgetting something? Thank God you reminded me! And what else? Not that. Bring me a cashmere scarf. Understood, my love. Don't keep your train in Elitopol for too long. Come back soon! I will. What's this? Are these supposed to be shackles? Is this supposed to be a chain? Is this why you stayed in Paris so long? I bet you enjoyed the company of French women there! Those women will ruin you. Look into my eyes! Your mustache! What have you done to your mustache? Whom did you give it to? He's gone? Really gone. It's the train to Elitopol, sir! I know that! Those women will be your ruin! A pill of glucose Take it to the shade. Understood. A pill glucose! Before sleep give him a pomegranate enema. Understood. Apply cupping-glasses to both sides of her pelvis. Understood. Do you have convulsions? Yes, I do. Very good! A pill of glucose! Is this the train to Elitopol? Yes. Yes, of course. Now be quick, boy! Continue your rounds... without me! Who is it? It's me, Khuta Odishelidze. Khuta? Yes... from prison. Remember when you looked at me in a different way? My husband is not at home. I know. I was informed already. What do you want? It's your patron saint's day today. Let me in and I will explain everything. I've brought you dozens of things and Turkish clogs. But my house is in a mess! I'll help you tidy up. Did anybody enter this house? Yes, a fat man. Wearing boots? Yes. Damn it! One can never be on time in this city! I can't bring these flowers to my wife, can I? 0 lovely Margalita If only you could commit a crime! What are you saying, Warden? I would have taken you to my prison and would have looked after you Please commit a crime, won't you? Let's not delay. Let's do it now! Here's the gun, shoot me, kill me! No, just wound me! Bash me on the head with this bottle, please! Please bash me, lovely Margalita Let's commit this crime together! Who could this be? It must be Triphon. He forgot his pumpkin and turned the train back. I can't fit in this, woman! Triphon, what do all these men want from me? How about here? No, we keep sour plum juice in that! What shall I do then? What a sweet family we used to be! Wait a second I'll hide here! Well done! I can't be seen here! I will be disgraced in front of my prisoners! Who's a clever boy? I'll do it myself. Do it yourself. Quick, my boy! Quick! Coming, Triphon! Coming! Can't you hear that I'm opening the door? Didn't you recognize me, Aunt Margalita? No. It's me, Geronti, the telegrapher. So why were you banging on the door? It's an urgent telegram for you. From your husband in Kharagauli. Bring it here and read it to me. To Margalita Amkoladze: "The river Chkhirimela has risen. We are standing. Be careful. My right eye is twitching. Signed: Triphoni." Twitching in the right eye is a good sign. Are you alone, Aunt Margalita? You are so beautiful. Let me kiss you just once. Tell your mother to wipe your nose and put you to sleep. Khuta, come down Land I can't breathe. Warden! Warden Who are you? The devil? Begone! Begone, Satan! I am just Ertaoz Bregvadze, not the devil. I came from the village. I couldn't find somewhere to spend the night in town. I'm sorry to disturb you. Don't you know anyone here? No. No relatives or friends? No, I am an orphan. An orphan? How wonderful You're just the person I need Come with me and listen carefully! My chimney is full of soot. My husband isn't here. I asked a friend to help me clean it. He's been there for quite some time and isn't moving. We can't get him out this way. Why not? You go down and wait for your friend there. I'll push him from above. Go! Khuta, get up Khuta, what's wrong with you? What happened to him? He has bitten the dust! What dust? He has kicked the bucket! What bucket? He's sleeping the big sleep! Which sleep? What are you talking about? What happened to him? He's dead, he has died Died?! He must have suffocated in the chimney. Died?! Goodness me! Triphon will be arrested I'll be arrested! You'll be arrested! Everybody will be arrested But we didn't kill him, did we? We should tell his family. You must be mad Then we must bury him. Yes, you're right! We can't leave him here! You must bury him Who, me? Yes, you Swear by Saint Porphile that you'll never betray me! I swear! Kiss it! Come to Porphile! Come and kiss him Let him keep them. He loved them both. He might need them Don't forget to bring the carpet back. It's a present from my father. Margalita, you are so beautiful So are you. Let's talk about it when you return. Oh, poor Khuta. Get moving, boy! May I swear one more time? Come. Light the lamp, Margalita, otherwise it's like being in a grave in here! Mummy, where am I? Give them to me, sir. You're dead and no longer need them. Who's dead? I'm alive! Stop. Talk to me. I'm tipsy and my heart aches! Do you know who I am? Stop. Don't move! What is this hen doing here? Who are you? Who told you to bury me alive? Answer me! Was it her? Was it? Begone, Beelzebub! Begone! You and your pretty bows! Why did you try to bury me alive? Who? Me? Bury you? Yes, you! Burying me! Still alive and full of energy! Don't come any closer! I'll scream my head off! Then who the hell are they? Who gave them my corpse? Don't come any closer! You cheated on me with them How dare you? How could I have cheated on you? Just look at them and then look at yourself in the mirror! Who is this woman? Speak! In the name of the law! You'll drive me completely mad How do you know this woman? I've never seen her before! First of all I shall test Jupiter and Mercury's friendship with Venus... Tetrahedron... Thank you, Plato! Octagon? Thank you, Euclid The square root of H2. Who's buried alive now? Me or you? Done! Allow me, my young man! Everything's clear now! Absolute steadiness should be replaced. Everything's clear. Yes! Exactly! What's this Z2 doing here? F+1! Please don't eat it! It's a good hen I do not intend to, young man! This is a unique flying species created by Nature herself! Now, get ready! Catch it! Now return it to me, please! You have just contributed to our great reflexion! Let me offer you my hand in friendship! Please be seated, young man! You must have come far! Not at all! Have a seat! And your friend will rest here! To what do I owe the great pleasure of your presence within these walls? To burying Odishelidze alive... With the help of a black hen... The hen was given 7 years and I 10. They said: Enjoy your stay! Understood. But surely something must have happened? I fell in love with a woman... madly! So did I! Madly? Yes, madly! Alas! It was a charming spring morning. I was walking down an empty street. All of a sudden the wind began to blow. I saw a straw hat flying towards me. I caught it. I looked around... and froze. A beautiful creature was standing near me. I knew that she was the one and so did she! I spent that day and night in front of Tamunia Kipiani's window! At dawn a crystal-white hand dropped a handkerchief. We decided to be married in Alaverdi monastery. "What?!" shouted the general. "My only daughter, marry a former student and amateur physicist?! Get lost, you scoundrel!" Although my love was enormous I couldn't help it and slapped my future father-in-law! Well done, uncle-grandpa A military tribunal sentenced me to 13 years for insulting the general. "You good-for-nothings!" I shouted at the tribunal. I was taken to court again and was given 6 years per judge. Which in total came to 49 years. How unexpectedly were our hopes dashed by cruel fate! The poor girl couldn't stand it any longer, and she gave her life to the river. Her last words were: "Why are we not little birds, free to fly up into the sky together?" And I have been haunted by the idea of flying ever since... I decided to build a flying machine, and to fly over the grave of my beloved... Do you believe that I will fly? I don't want to sound rude, my uncle-grandpa... but I haven't thought about it yet... I have debts to pay... But if God wills it, why not? I don't know when God will wish for me to fly! I can't wait that long I would like to enjoy the sky myself! Now tell me, young man perhaps you've thought about it. Get up and answer me. What differentiates a bird from a human... according to Archimedes? Wi... Win. Wings! Exactly! Wings! What else is different? And ch... Cheep cheep? No. Chaa? Charging forward. By charging forward. Forwarders" have almost been invented. Here, have a look. The height equals the infinity of love. The length equals aspiring virtue. C+01. The width equals unforgettable memories. If we will decide the issue of inner ardour and a few smaller but substantial problems... we will fly up into the sky! Are you gliding in the sky already?! Uncle-grandpa, we are lost! Let go of it, you chicken-head Don't despair, unknown friend I'll keep you there until you become as blue as the sky! I'll do it myself! Myself! And this side as well You can't wipe it from here! Open the claw: A+B. A worm-like thing was written here... Oh, yes! Alpha, of course! Exactly! Thank you, young man. You have saved us from falling. But when all this is finished and we are ready... how will we escape from here? I've dug a 7-verst tunnel. Only one meter to go. Here, have a look. We are free! What are you doing? Ruining the whole idea? Let's escape! Let's work and fly outside! You'll look after your late lover and I'll make my Margalita happy! But we still must calculate the formula of inner ardour! Where will I find such a cosy place to work? Who will let us work out there, anyway? These endless feasts will never end. Don't you know how we Georgians are? Don't you worry! We'll escape from here. We'll build the skyflier and will kidnap your bride. This is as true as two times two equals... To? Two. What did you say? What did you learn at school? No, we won't fly far with such knowledge! But we must fly! Please come this way. This will be your desk. Let us begin a proper education. Oh yes, I should finally introduce myself. Kristephore Mgaloblishvili from Garikula. Ertaoz Bregvadze from Dzuknuri. Very nice to meet you. Have a seat. Mister Ertaoz, let us finally agree that two times two equals... One, two, one, two, one two. Now think well, my honorable Ertaoz, and tell me, what is 11 subtracted from 22? Don't rush, we have lots of time. 11	subtracted from 22... It looks like... It does look like something, but what... 11 subtracted from 22... It's eleven, you idiot! It's inversely proportionate to the speed. Independently of both amplitude and vibration... even during its initial phase. Now let's move on to transforming an image by introducing an auxiliary angle. a SIN x + b COS x. Fine, let's move to that question. If the square product of two whole numbers equals one, then one of these numbers could be considered as... Don't say a word! You can't wipe it from here! Which star is the most forward striving? The flying star of Bernard. And the sun? It's our closest star, it is striving towards the constellation of Hercules. Splendid Hey sun, rise and shine! Don't hide behind that hill! Am n is withered by the frost, And needs your warmth to heal! G = M + 1 Alpha multiplied by the rectilinear integral L + Mc multiplied by D Beta, continue... Since Delta + AXY + YBX + BY = 0 Hurray DY + CXY X U = ± 0 CF = 1 CF = 1 Gosh, this is it! Is this it? This is it! Is it? This is it! We are gliding in the sky already! Then let's get out of here! I'll go first. No, Ertaoz, two men can't fit in there, also one meter still needs to be dug. Count to 2,500 and follow me. 1519, 1520, 1521... 2500 How sweet you are, air of freedom 45° ± R2 = the joy of the infinity of spaces... There isn't a single mistake! We must be under the suburbs, in the forest. I can see the light! Finally, we are free! Goodness me! We must be in the forest. It's a paradox! Listen, what is this W doing here? What should be here? What? Pa... Ра... ra... Parabola Oh yes, parabola! What a feeble mistake! How long will it take to correct it? Three years, four at most. Four years? My lovely Margalita! You, too, must be longing for me! Oh, Tamunia Quick, quick! Oh, my lovely Margalita, thank you I'm coming, I'm coming Can't you see, Triphon, that I'm opening the door? Who are you? It's me, Ertaoz. Don't you recognize me? It's me, Ertaoz Bregvadze. You must have suffered for me... I did recognize you. You are so beautiful. You're beautiful, too, but.. have those 10 years passed? They have not. But I missed you so much that I escaped from prison! Go back to prison immediately! You'll be arrested! I'll be arrested and so will Triphon! Wait, wait! Goodness me! Don't be afraid! It's my teacher. It's a great pleasure to meet you, Miss Margalita! I've heard about you, but seeing you has exceeded all my expectations! Margalita, we decided to build a skyflier. What are you saying? Yes, miss, the skyflier it will be! Imagine an enormous hen as big as a house... It will fly itself... Hello! Noshrevan! Let go of me! Help, Noshrevan Don't worry! Gentlemen! I've become the unintentional witness of your splendid idea! Who's this? He's my relative. Don't worry, Margalita A huge hen that will fly on its own? Yes, it will! How interesting, Margalita I wish you knew how I respect titanic ideas! So you believe in our idea? Of course I do! Just like this one, but an enormous hen Splendid idea! Which tunnel shall we check first? I have to do everything They are there! We should have gone into the other tunnel, sir! This tunnel. Where the hell did those madmen go? We've been to both tunnels, sir! Not a squeak out of you Occupy all the tunnels. If you see those scoundrels... shoot them in the legs! The others, follow me! Have you come back, Triphon? I have. You have guests. Don't let them go! I'll be right back. Fine. But who are you? Ill	bring some people with me... Understood. We will fly in the azure sky, gliding, enjoying ourselves... Then we'll go to Alaverdi, get married and be together till we die. I won't need that. Let Triphon have it. Triphon, my love! He has come back! My boy, my boy... Wait a second, woman! We have guests, apparently. I also met a black man who said he'll bring more men. Please welcome them properly. Be seated, my dear guests. I am really exhausted. Margalita, dear, they also look tired. Prepare something for all of us. My name is Ertaoz, the son of Mizana Bregvadze. I'm sure you've heard of him... Thank you for making such a wonderful thing, my dear wife! Margalita and I have been madly in love with each other... Yes, they are! Please let me marry her... I don't want to fly... And so? This is how God created this world, sir... A woman must marry a man. They will have children.. And will live happily ever after... Please don't refuse me, uncle! I will love Margalita till the day I die! So the first beggar will marry my wife, and the other beggar will become my in-law? You have grasped the essential facts correctly... but let us not spoil our future relationship by being so rude.... Understood. Fine. Triphon Move away, woman! Who the hell was that black man? Mr Triphon! Don't try our patience! Get lost, you beggars! Get lost, you wretch MC2 + 1! I'll do it myself! Forward, my eagles! Follow me! I knew he would come here! He can't move away from this stone, that blasted fossil! Mummy! Help! What shall we do now? Margalita, I know that scoundrel is with you now. You stay here. If they appear, shoot them in the legs. Eagles, follow me! I don't want to fly! Roll her up, Ertaoz! Women are stubborn She doesn't know what happiness awaits her with you! Lift her and let's go!

Although I can't provide you with a phaeton... this will also do... Thank you. Allow me to help you. What is happening? You traitors! Let go of my Margalita This is treason! Let go of her! What shall I do? Margalita Open your eyes! Look at me! You shameless man! People, if you're going to a good place... take me with you... Get rid of this blasted hen Who was that black man, I wonder? Come with me. You need some rest. Halt! Don't move! Or we'll kill you all They are here! These people are mine. They were yours, but now they're mine! No, they escaped from my prison! And rightly so! Why the hell are you hanging around this house? The chimney was blocked. Why don't you stick to your chimney, you tie-wearing butterfly! Boys! You jealous barbarian I will kill you all! He'll kill us both Think of something, Margalita Come with me, quickly! Triphon I won't fit in there, Margalita Come! Double your size has fitted in there. Who was that double-my-size, I wonder? May I stay? You must all leave now! I don't want to hear even a squeak about it! Go back to your houses. We are on holiday. You'll come back to me in two weeks. Good morning, gentlemen. Open his means of communication. You bastard... Close it, close it! Welcome, Mr Kristephore! Open his means of communication. You wretched... Close it, close it! Gentlemen. Why should that splendid idea of yours... Regarding flying away... Write it down as "flyology Take place somewhere far away... Instead of our city and with me? I will create all the conditions for you to work, relax, build and fly! Enchanté! Write it down Doctor, it's him again! He must have come back for more. Open their means of communication. Let them negotiate between each other. Good day, doctor. Good day. Please come in. Go away. We are under quarantine. Ertaoz, we must endure this insult... We must go with them.. The destiny of the skyflier is being decided now... Gentlemen, open his means of communication. I want to hear him. What about Margalita? If we don't build the skyflier, how will we kidnap the lovely Margalita? I cannot afford to waste such valuable material so carelessly... Ibericus Naïve Caucasus Aero-Dynamicus Temperamentus. It has not yet been detected in Europe, and now you come here to take away these people obsessed with the idea of flying? But what if they really will fly away? What do you mean, fly away? Yes, what if they will? A pill of glucose. So you believe that they will fly away? Nothing can make a human fly, but... with those loonies, nothing can be ruled out... Open you mouth and say "Aaaah Say "Aaaah". Open your mouth and say... No, let them stay here. Keep them since they are so internationally important... Sit down. Sit!

What we need is: a joist... ox leather... Write everything down Tin for the engine... And three cubic metres of wood The night before we fly we'll need: a drum... roses... a felt cloak... and a wineskin. Yes, of course! How can one fly away without a drum and a wineskin?

Let's record everything so that the next generations will not lose the story of your flying off the handle... Our flying off? With great pleasure! Enchanté! What's wrong with you? How would you deal with this? 5D / 2... No, I don't want to hear about it! The speed is inversely proportionate to movement. Young man, bear with me! According to the theory of passion, love strives upwards... How about X? We must solve it again. How dare you, young man? I've been spending entire nights solving these formulas! This is a truth This is not truth for me! This is not an axiom! Let us agree to disagree, Mr Ertaoz, but whichever one of us is right will be decided in heaven! Why can't people understand that love is vertical and simultaneously rotatable? Paris. Urgent telegram. To Prof. Dichelle. Dear professor and colleague!
