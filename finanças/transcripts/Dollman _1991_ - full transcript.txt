Please move on and go about your business. The laundromat is now under police control. Blockades will remain until further notice. Do not cross the barricades. Repeat, do not cross the barricades. Hyperspeed cruiser. 10 million mineral bricks and safe passage out of this universe as we know it. Son of a bitch is even crazier than we thought if he thinks we're gonna give him any of these things. That's exactly what we're going to do, Captain Skyresh. I want this situation resolved now. Give him what he wants and get rid of him. Elections are next week and I don't need dead, fat ladies on video screens all over the city. Got it, Mr.Mayor. Just got a better idea. Brick Bardo just showed up. Bardo? I just said I don't want a bloodbath. I'm ordering you to meet his demands. Mayor? Sorry, I'm having some trouble with the phone here. I gotta go. Skyresh! Skyresh! Skyr... This is an official police situation. Anyone found in an unauthorized area is subject to immediate arrest and beating. Brick, what are you doing here? This is a police control blockade. Any civilians left remain on perimeter or they... Brick. Happy to see you. Hell of a mess. Got in there with 13 hostages. Mayor wants us to give in. I'm suspended, remember? Yeah, but have you got any ideas? I've got an idea. I'm gonna use hot water for my whites. A cold wash and warm rinse for my colors. What are you talking about? I'm angry, Captain. This is where I do it. Excuse me. So Brick's gonna take care of this? Yeah. Right. One. Two. - Three. - Hey asshole! What the fuck do you think you're doing? I'm gonna Kill these fat ladies! Hey! Hey! Hey, I am talking to you, shitbrain! Somebody better get this moron out of here or the fat is going to hit the fan! That's right. One of us ought to get going. But I already put my money in the machine. I swear, I am going to do it. Wow! That's a Groger blaster! The most powerful handgun in the universe! That's right, fat boy. And it's gonna to blow a hole clean through this fat lady. And then blow a hole out of you. And that's gonna blow a hole out of the lady behind you. Shut up! There's gonna be a lot of guts floatin' around in the laundromat. Do you know what I mean, fat boy? No, nooooo! You will be informed when the laundromat is once again safe. Please make no attempt to retrieve your laundry. Repeat. Skyresh. What the hell happened here? Two women in cardiac arrest. - Everything's under control. - The suspect is in custody. And every news station in town is reporting that one of my officers endangered a laundromat full of hostages. Think how that looks! Mr.Mayor, no one was Killed and I thought with Bardo here... I'll do the thinking, Captain. There's that son of a bitch now. Disappointed you didn't get to kill anyone tonight, Bardo? You're through, you goddamn psycho! Take off those sunglasses, it's night! I want that bastard suspended! He's already under suspension because of the incident in Filmore. - Then fire his ass! - I want him gone! Hey! Thanks for saving my mom. Tonight at 11:68 there was an extreme shootout at a south central Laundromat. Unidentified sources a the crime scene claim that a renegade ex-cop went on a shooting rampage that has left an unconfirmed 27 bystanders wounded and another 3.6 dead. With more on this tragic, fastbreaking story, Har Hunbud. Details are still sketchy at this point, Harry. However, an anonymous official has heard rumor that 1.4 of the dead are indeed children. The mayor's office has released no actual details at this time. However, a highly placed authority has implied the identity of the killer to be known. The name Brick Bardo was overheard. Brick Bardo. Isn't he the detective that was involved in the Filmore incident earlier this year? That's right Harry... We'll come back on this late breaking story. But first, we've got a travel advisory warning from Lucretia Labelle. That rare phenomenon known as the energy... Advise you alternate routes until planettran gives the all clear. Energy bands are known to destroy some ships. There's an old friend wants to see you, Bardo. A number of ships have vanished into the energy bands and no trace of them has ever... Well, I'm sure that all space travelers will heed your warning and avoid those nasty energy bands. Rise and shine. I saw the news tonight. You're a very violent man, Bardo. Yes, I know, it's a violent universe. I bet you'd thought you'd seen the last of me. I am seeing the last of you, Sprug. After our last encounter, this is all we managed to salvage. I'll see if I can remember the first time, Conklin bank job. I blew off your left arm. And most of my left foot. But then there was the space extortion. What did I tear, two or three legs? Among other things. The last time all I remember was your head rolling around in the parking lot. I didn't think there was enough to save. Modern medicine. They're doing some wonderful things. It's too bad your lovely family couldn't benefit as I have. But then I think, even our best doctors couldn't have done anything with what was left of them. What do you want? I'll tell you what I want, Bardo. 50,000 molecular ions. And I'll get them too. You know why? Because my cruiser is loaded with a dimensional fusion bomb that'll blow the atoms of this city into another universe unless they pay up. That'll never happen. Why not? Somehow you'll fuck it up. You always fuck it up. No Bardo, you've always screwed up my plans. But this time you won't have a chance, because you're gonna be in tiny, tiny little atoms. We're gonna blow you apart piece by piece, Bardo. It's mine now. I've heard about this custom made monster for years. Don't worry, Bardo. I'll take good care of it. I'll put it to good use. Start with his left hand. How does it feel to be on the other side, Bardo? - I don't know. - You tell me. I'm gonna die. You can't kill me anymore. What do you want, asshole? Nothing. You're just gonna walk away? - Warning. - Intruder is following you. Closing fast. Warning. Sense indication of energy bands. Warning. Your craft won't take the pressure. Neither will yours. Yeah? I don't give a fuck! What makes you think I do? Impact with energy bands... Ground is undergoing pressure. Warning, energy bands ahead. Anticipated impact. Final boarding. Energy bands are active impact in 0.5 seconds. We have impact. We have impact. You have landed on an alien planet. Air and pressure and atmosphere compatible to human life. Warning, based on sensor calculations of planet structures. Your size relationships are altered. This planet's life forms are a ratio of six to one larger. Hey, you in the wrong neighborhood? You East Side fucks. Hey! Don't you be sellin' that trash in my neighborhood! That's it! I've had it with you sleazy motherfuckin' dope dealers sellin' shit in my neighborhood! - Hey, you... - Don't fuckin' move! I'll fuckin' kick your ass! Get the fuck out of here before I kick your ass! You want me to fuckin' kill you? I will! Get out of here! Don't fuckin' come back! Move it! Go take your shit with you! - Get out of here. - You get the fuck out of here! Go! Beat it! Scumbag. Fuck. Everyday we are forced to fight for our lives, for the lives of our children. That's why you have joined our neighborhood watch program. Today we have a very special guest who will explain to us how the police plan to help us in our fight. Please welcome Captain Arnold Shuller of the Police Commission. - Thank you for coming. - Nice to be here. Mrs. Alejandro is absolutely right. We are involved in a war. If it weren't for you people, we would have no chance of winning. I think you are the ones who deserve my applause. Now that you have your soundbite, Captain Shuller, you can go ahead and tell us exactly how you plan to help us. What do you have in mind? Beefed up patrols? Raiding the crack houses? Roadblocks? It's not as simple as that. You know, it's a very big city, and Dalton Avenue is not the only area that needs help. Look, you're the police. Protect and serve. It's your job. Protect us. Of course we'll protect you, Mrs. Alejandro. We will always try to protect you. Together we can win this war. Est√° Debi. There's the bitch. Let's teach her no to mess with our business, huh? Bitch! Come here! Let go of me! Debi. Que traes? You fuck with our business? You die. Entiendes? Ai! Let go of me! - Get her! - Come here you bitch! Come here, bitch! You little whore! You're gonna burn! Watch this! Fuck you! Oh God! Drop the weapons! Step away from the girl! Holy shit! Shit! Giants. Place full of giants. I hate giants! I didn't mean to scare you. Scare me? Who are you? - What am I worried about? - This is just a bad dream. I must be in shock. Or I'm hallucinating. Or I have a concussion. You are so small! We can't stay here. They'll be back. Those punks? I don't think so. - They'll bring their whole gang. - We gotta get out of here. I'm not going anywhere. Stop it. Stop it, lady. Hey, you'll wreck... - Hey whoa, look! - A head on the road. Where? - No no, a two inch head. - Look! The fuck is that, man? - The fuck is that? - Look, my friends. Let's cut to the chase. I'm obviously a visitor from another world who's had a bit of trouble. You help me out, I'll help you out. He fuckin' talks. Gonna help me do what? - Conquer your world. - Such as it is. I've got a bomb you could use. Something that will rip your dimension a new asshole. Rip my dimension? Believe me, nobody will fuck with you ever again. With a bomb like that, we could blow up the entire east side. We can take the whole fuckin' borough. Huh? This place would be mine. Whatever's left behind, yes, would be yours. Do we have a deal? - Yeah, what do you want? - Like, a new hat or something? Build the bomb off the ship. Kevin, it's your Mom! What's the secret password? - Kevin, open the door. - Hurry up. Hey, hey, hey. Bronco Space Star! Kevin, no! Put me down. Kevin, no! Kevin, no! Shit! Whoa! What a mouth. Sorry. Are you alright? I never felt better in my life. My son thought you were a toy. Bronco Space Star is his favorite TV show. What is it, mom? It's a little man, Kevin. So where did you come from? How did you get here? Last thing I remember, I was chasing Sprug into the energy bands. Energy bands? Mom, he's an alien. Alien? - What planet do you come from? - Mars? Venus? Arturos. - Arturo. - Of course. - Honey, he's not an alien. - He's a small man that got lost. - Whoa! - Jesus. Whoa! I want one of those, Mom. Give me that gun! No way. Give me the gun. I will not have guns in my house! Alright, don't pull that thing out again. When will this nightmare be over? It's not a nightmare. Then what the hell is it? It's the south Bronx. How we doing? Hey, the rich get richer, Braxton. That's the plan. What the fuck is this? I don't pay you cholos to... Oh fuck, man. My fuckin' pool table! It's ruined! Who put him on the goddamn pool table, huh? You think the blood is gonna come right out of the goddamn felt? - It wasn't my fault. - It was this pendejo's fault. He wanted to fuck with Debi! Told him not to! Thought I told you not to fuck with Debi. Hey, it was her fuckin' with us. We were just trying to protect ourselves. - She did this to you? - You expect me to believe that? - She had this little doll. - Little dollman. - A doll? - What the fuck are you talking about? - Well this guy, little guy. - He just jumped out. Man, he started shooting everybody. You telling me a midget did this to you? - No, no! - It was no midget, pendejo. Mira, a little guy like this. About this big. Have another fuckin' drink, Jackson. You shut the fuck up, I'm trying to think! Look what you made me do! See, that's what happens when people start taking things apart themselves! Anybody else got any bright ideas? You got a fuckin' bright idea? How about you? You got a bright idea, huh? I have an idea. It's an invasion, homeboys. This better be good, head. There's only one person that can stop you once I give you the dimensional bomb. Brick Bardo. What's a Brick Bardo? He's an asshole cop from my world. He followed me here. Well, how do you know it's him? There's only one weapon in the universe that can destroy atomic matter like that. It's dangerous to me. And to you too. If I were you, I'd go out and Kill him right now. Oh yeah? Well if I was you, I'd quit while I was ahead. Think how it looks. Guy moves into your territory, blows away your two men. I know I wouldn't like it. He's not showing you proper respect. People will think you've lost control. This guys a cop, huh? I'm gonna go to Debi's. I'm gonna show this cop he's in the wrong fuckin' neighborhood. You stay here and clean up this mess. Get a fuckin' breath mint or something. We don't fuck around, ese. Get his fuckin' body out of here! Mister, are you sure you know what you're doing? Isn't it past your bedtime, kid? No power, that's your problem, mister. Okay. What size batteries does this thing take? - Look kid, I'm a little busy right now. - So get the hell away from me, huh? Are all people on your planet assholes like you? Sometimes. Hey, I know somebody that can help you. Gerald! - Gerald? - Gerald! - The show is over. - Good night. Get out of my apartment! Come on, out! Out! What are you kids deaf? Go, get out now! Kevin, I want to talk to you. Good night, good bye! Hello, get out! Get out of my house! This is interesting. Get away from the ship, it's not a toy. Obviously. - This is my best friend Gerald. - He's the brains of the school. Look, I said get away from my ship! Quite aggressive, isn't he? Kind of a jerk. - Gerald, you too. - Good night. - But... - But nothing. It's late. Kevin, did I tell you to tell everybody in the neighborhood that we have a space man living in our house? Don't you think we have enough problems? But Mom, what's the fun of having an alien if you can't show it off? Now listen, don't do anything without asking me first! What? - Get the gun out of her face. - What did I just tell you? Hey Kevin, how you doing? Don't touch him, Braxton! What do you want? I came by to visit, see how you're doing. You're looking good. Want some money or something? I don't want your money or anything from you! Just get these people out of my house, Braxton! I'm looking for your friend, the Midget. - I told you, he's not a midget! - Will you shut the fuck up? Look, I don't know who you're talking about. Look, don't fuck with me, Debi. This dollman, he hit my boys. Braxton, leave us alone! Where is he? It's just like the head's. Oh fuck! It's about the size of him. Jesus Christ. Oh fuck. Good night. A little paint, it'll be just like brand new. Yeah. Your world's just as violent as ours, isn't it? Things don't change, do they? People don't. I'm gonna lose, aren't I? Only if you give up, lady. Thanks. Mommy! Mommy! - What is it, honey? - Mommy. Oh, baby. The bad men are gone. It's alright. Shh. It's a bad dream, honey. Go back to sleep. Yo Brax, what's up, man? What the fuck? Fuck, not like this. I see you've met Brick. I've had some experience with his blaster damage. I can stop the bleeding by fusing the molecules with a sonic proton wand. If there's no internal bleeding, you might live. - Do it. - Not so fast. You promised to help me. I want that help now, tonight. It's too dangerous here and I'm tired of being small. I want my ship repaired, and I want to leave fast. Do we have an understanding? - Yeah, whatever you say. - Just fuckin' do it! Hey, you're pretty fuckin' good. Hey, you promised me a bomb. You first show it to me or there's no deal. It's right behind me. All you do is push the button. 10 seconds later, boom. Everything within three parsecs is sent to another dimension forever. But that's for later. After you've done everything I need. From now on, you work for me. - You do what I say. - Work for you? You're in the wrong fuckin' neighborhood, deadhead. All homies together, we're going to war. With who? With the fuckin' dollman, who else? Well we heard he just popped Jackson and the other guys, and he almost killed you. - So the fuck what? - We got a dimensional bomb. I'm gonna settle this fuckin' once and for all. Fuckin' demenial bomb. - If you're cold you can put this on. - It's warm. No thanks. Alright. So do you have a family back home? - Not anymore. - But you used to? Mind if I get a little sleep? - Sorry. - Good night. I had a wife and two kids. Baby girl. A boy about Kevin's age. Someone who wanted to hurt me did it by hurting them. Kevin's father's dead too. He was shot holding up a liquor store eight years ago. Kevin doesn't even remember him. It was a gang banger. Brooklyn Homeboy. At the time I thought Homeboy was as cool as you could get. And then when Kevin was born, he swore he was done with gangs, done with crime, but he lied. I don't know, it's like in this neighborhood gangs are the only way you can be noticed. It's the only way you can be somebody. They give you a new name and then you're Shorty or Sleepy or Psycho. Gangs give you an identity. You don't know how hard it is keeping Kevin away. His friends already belong. He's trying but I'm gonna lose him if I don't do something about it. So why don't you leave? Where would I go? I don't have any money. I can't even pay the rent. Dropped out of school to have Kevin. Besides, this is my home. This is where I grew up. Everything I've ever known is here. I'm not gonna run away. - You've got a lot of guts, lady. - Maybe you're using the wrong approach. What do you mean? Fight fire with fire. I always thought you fought fire with water. Some fires are too big. Kevin, leave him alone. Here, get it gear. Have a good day at school. Be careful. - Okay, Mom. - I love you. I love you, goodbye. Be careful. I will. Oh hi. Here's my number at work in case you need to call. I don't think goin' to work is such a great idea. Those punks will be looking for you. Well, if I don't go to work I don't get paid. If I don't get paid, I can't pay the rent, there's nothing to eat, so I'm going to work. I think you should stay in though. The world isn't safe for someone your size. I'll be home at seven. Kevin will be home around 3:30. Look lady, I'm gonna find the rest of these punks and finish this. No, you're not. I gotta do what I gotta do, lady. Be careful out there, Debi. So you're trying to tell me that a 15-inch man saved your ass from Braxton? Yes, I thought it was like a hallucination or something. I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do with him. A 13-inch man, are you sure it wasn't a dream? I'm serious. Come over tonight and see him for yourself. I'd love to see a 13-inch man. You know what I mean. I don't know where he came from or what to do about him. What's so funny, ladies? Nothing's funny, sir. Nothing funny about toxic waste, Mr.Lowman. - Well, then get back to work! - You're wasting time. Sheesh, what's his problem? He asked me out to the Guns n'Roses concert. I told him I don't date the mutant slime from work. - You didn't. - Yeah. What the fuck are we waiting for? We're waitin' 'cause I said we're waitin'. I'll make an example out of this bitch. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well it's about time. - The fuck, man. - What's the matter? Fuck. Yo, I thought that little guy fixed you. I hope he didn't go home. Not without his ship. You know, there doesn't seem to be much structural damage. Maybe if I just adjust this, or how about... Back away, Gerald. I think he suffers from Napoleonic Syndrome. - What? - Short man's complex. So, how long do you think this guy's gonna stay at your place? - I don't know. - I don't know. His spaceship doesn't work so he can't really go anywhere. Guess he's stuck here. You want him to stay though, don't ya? Senora Alejandro. Senora Rodriguez, que tal? I heard about this dollman. That he blow away Braxton Red's homies last night. Yeah, it's true. Neighborhood Watch? Thursday, 7:30 at the cafeteria. - I'll be there. - Really? Si. Que bien, you know we can make a difference. We can change this neighborhood. Especially with this dollman blowing away all the scumbags for us, eh? That's not the way I wanted this to work out. - Bye girlfriend. - See ya. Bye lady, see you. Braxton, leave me alone! Or what, your little friend gonna come out here and beat me up, huh? - Get her in the car. - We're gonna stop you, you son of a bitch! Get away! All of ya! Get off! Where's Dollman? Braxton's got your mom downstairs. Mommy! Mommy! Kevin, get out of the way! Mom! Yo, space owl, man! Keep your eye out for the dollman, 'cause he's gonna come lookin' for her. Hey, can you spare a smoke, man? Sit down. - See anything yet? - No. I bet that motherfucker's not gonna come here. - Dammit. - Hey, tell Armando we gotta wait. - Stop this, Braxton. - You're hurt. What the fuck do you care? Yeah. Don't even think about it. Braxton, you're gonna die if you don't get some help. So I die. But you can stop this before you go down. When you gonna get hip to what's going on here, huh? We're all gonna go down, Debi, 'cause that's the way the man wants it. Can't you see that? Huh? You think they care about you? You think they care about Dalton Avenue? They don't give a shit. You're on the wrong fucking side. Sit down. Don't make me get up. Fuckin' sit down! What the fuck are we fuckin' waiting for? I mean, fuck this shit! Fuck man, the fuckin' setup is fucked up. The little fucker fuckin' knows what kind of fuckin' shit is fuckin' waitin' here to fuck him up. So let's get the fuck out of this fuckin' place and leave alone this fuckin' motherfucker! Has fuckin' anybody said anything yet? Nothing yet. Come on down here. Fuck it! Braxton man, it's been three hours. He ain't gonna show. He must have found out what was waitin' for him. Fuck him. You go look for him, alright? Go on. Come on, go on. Okay, Jammer. The punk's a no show, so we're out of here. The vans will meet us down here. Over. Got it, homie. Move, move! And I thought this was gonna be hard. Yo, Jimmer. Jimmer, man, where the fuck are you? Get down here. We're ready to roll. What the fuck's going on up there? Urban fucking renewal. Big mistake, Debi. Big fuckin' mistake, Debi! You remember Benny, huh? Oh, Debi. Oh, fuck. I fuckin' kept you alive, and you fuckin' disrespect me! You fuckin' bitch. I'll show you what you get, if you're disrespecting me! Nobody disrespects me! Goodbye, Debi. Why don't you pick on someone your own size, you fuckin' puke? You sack of pus. You remind me of a guy I knew back home. I didn't like him either. Ah, motherfucker! Fuck, my gun! Now let's see how you like it, you tiny motherfucker. No, let's see what it's like for you, motherfucker. Stand aside, lady, let me finish this. - It's finished. - Come on, it's finished. Don't you see that? He's scum, he doesn't deserve to live. Because your family isn't alive, is that it? Come on, let it go. Just let it go. Stand aside. Okay. Don't do it for me! Okay, lady. You win. - Wrong. - Nobody fuckin' wins. Dimensional fusion bomb. Run! Debi, run! So Debi, tell me size doesn't count.
