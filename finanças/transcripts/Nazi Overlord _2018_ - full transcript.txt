Subtitles by explosiveskull Sir, are you okay? Sir? Sir? We got 'em on the run! Forward, boys! Captain, come on, you got to eat. Good work out there, gentlemen. They told me either Hawaii or Guam. I'm ready to go to Hawaii. That's where all the opportunity will be. What about you, Captain? I bet you got the sweetest deals. Gentlemen, just because I pray doesn't mean you have to. No, it's... it's good. I prayed like a little bitch out in the field. Whoops, sorry Lord. Hey, Haas? Hmm? Who are those guys? Colonel just let them out of the brig. They went AWOL during Normandy. Tried to go AWOL. They didn't even make it a mile. Hey, a lot of men were scared out there. Fear makes you do a lot of things, things you didn't think were possible. Yeah, lots of men died out there on the beach, probably more than needed to with guys running away from the action instead of helping their fellow man. Are you talking to somebody in particular? Oh, you're damn right I am. Hey, Private, everyone's on edge right now. Nah, I don't got a damn thing to say to you. That's right, run away, run away. AWOL or not, those men know how to handle a gun. Does make me wonder why they ran away in the first place. Well, Colonel wants them to redeem themselves, so, and he believes they're good men. He's giving them a second chance 'cause we're almost out of men. Well, if they decide to turn yellow and run, Cap'll stop them. Why would I keep them in line? They're not assigned to me. Now that Normandy's secure, what is the next assignment? You're coming with us, right, Captain? That's why I volunteered. This is your squad, right? That's what Colonel told us. Isn't that what he told you? Well, look, I'm sorry I didn't talk with you about this earlier or, to be quite honest, even ask you, but as we know, wartime doesn't allow for the formalities, you know. So I take it I'm not going back to Washington yet? Look, first of all, look, I heard what you did on the beach, and it make me glad to hear that I have a man who's not afraid to kick these guys in the nuts one-on-one, okay? And look, is it true you killed a Nazi with your bare hands? The most effective weapon at the time, Sir. I'm taking you off the field. So I am going home? You want to go home? I go where I'm needed, Sir. After you. Right there. So look, I'm not ready to send you back home. Not yet, not without her. She's Dr. India Eris, a British scientist. She was doing research in Belgium when the Nazis took her hostage two months ago. - What type of research? - Unknown. She was working with the British government on some kind of biological warfare method or some sophisticated crap like that. I don't know. Biological warfare, like black plague? Oh come on, biological warfare has its place. It's not as scary as it sounds. I'll take a gun over some lab experiment any day. Spoken like my kind of American. Cigar? I'm fine, thank you, Sir. That was her lab in Belgium. Now apparently, she was able to burn down all her research before the Nazis took her. So they don't have her files, but they have the next best thing. Her. Sir, two months is a long time. She could be anywhere. Negative. British intelligence spotted her at a refugee camp in Romania on a scout. Now apparently she was under great duress, and it appears that she's working now for the Nazi regime. Sir, you know, as I well know, that nobody can make you do anything you don't want to do. Well, if that was the case, why, half of the men in my unit wouldn't be doing what I tell them to do every day, now, would they? What's this got to do with me? Miss Eris is an invaluable asset. Now, we need her back on the Allied side. Yeah, but she's British, why don't they go find her? They tried twice. We tried twice. And? The British and U.S. units went missing. They went missing. Now look, something's happening in Romania, but we can't put enough boots on the ground to send in a full unit of men. I'm an Army Captain, Sir. I'm not Special Forces. I'm not trained for cloak-and-dagger missions. Okay, look, intelligence says there's a base near there where the Nazis are operating from. My guess, it's within a five-mile perimeter of the village. Now just start to scout there. But I want you to be aware, these locals are hostile to Americans. Sir, with all due respect, I'm not the right man for the job. With all due respect, yes, you are. Look, all of our other resources are in Germany, China and Japan. I think the Nazis know that, okay. They don't think we're paying any attention to Romania, and that's why we're going to go and take advantage of that. Sir, since you assigned me this operation, I'm assuming you assigned me my squad, as well? It's no one you wouldn't have selected yourself. You got Lieutenant Haas, uh, plus Grey, Thompson, Brisco and any other jokers you might want. Including those guys that went AWOL. Hey, look, the mission will give them a chance to win their spines back because I don't send cowards home, all right? You bring that doctor back to me, I will be sure that the president himself thanks you. You can shake my hand now, Sir. I'm in. Thank you. Coffee, Captain? Where'd you get the fresh coffee? I didn't. So how close are we? Should be coming up on the village in a few more paces. There's something blocking the road ahead. Looks like some fallen branches. Let's go. So, uh, this broad's just gonna be waiting for us with open arms to come save her? This isn't a Flash Gordon serial, Grey. Eh, screw that. They're gonna be making movies about me when I get home. Is that so? So-di-so-so, Mr. Thompson. Grey, who's gonna play you, Ginger Rogers? My uncle's a publisher. He's gonna wait for us to get some accounts on the front lines. They go crazy for that secret agent stuff. Kid, you're too loud to hold anything secret. Yeah, coming from the guy with the big mouth. Ambush! Hit the floor. Brisco, hold your fire. You're wasting your ammo without a target. Damn, what are they waiting for? Maybe Brisco got 'em. What the.... - Hold your fire. - But I heard 'em! Well, we can't see them. Then how can they see us? Collins! Hey! Collins! Collins! - Hold your fire! - They've gone quiet. Brisco! Come on, come on! No, no, no, no! Take cover! We got to go! Collins, St. John, grab the trunk. What about the radio? All right, we need to move. Collins, take inventory, we're heading out. Back to France? Damn it, St. John, is running away your answer to everything? We're not running away, I never did run away. Great, you're delusional, too. What the hell's your problem with me anyway, huh? You don't know what happened to me and Collins out there. My problem is I don't trust deserters having my back, - and you, Sir... - Brisco. Back to guard duty. Sir, someone else knows we're here. I don't think he's a soldier. Grey, bring him here. Haas? He's asking if we're angels. Talk to him. Haas? He says it makes him sad. Why? Because that means he's not dead yet. Where'd he find these tags? Tell him we're here to help him. We've got men and plenty of ammo. We need to find these men. Wherever they are, Dr. Eris isn't too far behind. Once we find her, we can get out of here. Hey, we're here to help you, but you got to help us find these men. We need to stop whoever did this. Please take us to them so they can't do it again. Okay, we're heading out. They took my son and daughter. My wife tried to stop them. They took her, too. I-I ran like a coward. This is God's punishment for not stopping them. Who's them? Who took your family away? The men with the black crosses. Nazis. No way, Collins, I told you to stand guard in the back. What, you gonna argue with me? Captain, with all due respect, this old man doesn't seem like he's quite all there. He may be crazy, but he's the only lead we got. Keep moving, St. John. Who's side is he on? He could be leading us right into an ambush. If he is, we'll be ready. Don't worry, I'm watching him. And I'm watching you. St. John, Collins. Already on it. People actually lived here? This must've been some sort of last stand. They did not go down easy. Haas, ask him where he got those dog-tags, if the men are still alive. Whoa, Captain, Captain, over here. Is it just the two of them? There's a third one over here. What happened to the rest of 'em? Is it all men? Is there any women? Without a full autopsy, it'd be hard to tell. He said the men with the black crosses brought her down to inspect the men before they burned the everything. From where? From where? From up there, the mountain. - Who's got eyes? - I do. All right, I want you to look at that hill, see if there's any activity. You two, guard the perimeter. If she's that close, the men that took her are even closer. Hey Cap, come look at these skeletons. I don't think they're made up of the same person. Explain. Their limbs, they're on the wrong side, see? They were broken apart and reattached, soldered on. They took off the limbs and put 'em on the opposite side? But why? Captain, there's some sort of castle or fortress on that mountain. Castle? Come on. If you don't believe me, see it for yourself. We've got movement in the trees. You sure it ain't just wildlife? I don't like this. I don't like this at all. - We got to move. - I don't like it, either. All right, we're heading out. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Haas? Haas, what's he saying? He's saying kill yourself, kill yourself before it's too late. Too late for what? Grey, stop firing. Hold on to your bullets. Breathe. Deeply. Focus. What are these guys, invisible? There, by the woods. Proceed to the north. Follow me. Find cover in those trees! Whoever our shooter is, his aim sure sucks. Yeah, well, he had no problem taking out the old man. What's that? Stop. - Captain, this is... - Halt. Hold your ground. We're open targets here. Exactly. Wait here. Why did you do that? They're not trying to kill us. They're trying to capture us. What? They want us alive. Okay, I'm ordering a full retreat. On my count, we're heading back to the river the way we came. Everybody got that? I want you to fire everything you have at that barn. Load up. You boys ready? Three, two, one. Brisco! We're under fire. We need to retreat! - Get out of here. - This way! Save yourselves. Captain, which way? Looks like they gave up on not trying to kill us. This way, into the mineshaft. No, no, Sir, wait, we need cover and a place with tactical advantage. This way now. Come on. Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam! Here they come. Okay, okay. All right, it's okay. Collins, hang in there, buddy. He's losing a lot of blood. Bullet's still in him. Hang in there, come on. All right, I want everyone to spread out. I want to hit it from all angles in case they come in here. We're sitting ducks, man. Not if we hit them first. Wind. What's that, Private? It's coming from the back. That means there's another way in here. Haas, go in the back of the cave and scout it out, see if there's another way out. Hang in there, buddy, you're gonna be okay. Captain! Go! They're here. - No, no! - Sam, no, no! Billy! Sam! Billy! Sam! Haas! Haas! Haas! Out this way! Damnit! I don't do good in small spaces, Cap. It's okay, it's okay. Nuh-uh, I don't do good in small spaces, Cap. - Grey, Grey. - Get me out of here, man! Grey, Grey, look, it's okay. You're all right. You're okay. How we doing? I pulled down all the loose rocks I can, but there's still too much debris blocking the exits. - All right. - I'll keep trying. Hey, Captain, come check this out. It's a pretty advanced air filter. You could breathe on the moon with this thing. Yeah, it's a great prevention tool, especially against biochemical agents. They gonna gas us? Tranquilizer. They wanted to take us alive. Why wouldn't they just kill us? We were fighting back. They must've had orders not to kill. Yeah, because Nazis never disobey orders. That's why they grabbed Collins. He was injured. He was the easiest one to take. What the hell do they want us for? Tattoos. What? Brisco and Collins, they had tattoos, right? What does that have to do with anything at all? Because they skin guys alive who have tattoos for decoration. That's a load of bullshit. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Get it off me. Get it off me. - Grey, Grey. - What are you doing, Grey? - Calm down! - I'm not gonna let them get me. - Grey, Grey. - Stop, stop! It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's all right, you're all right. Hey, it's okay to be afraid, it's okay. Oh, yeah, is it? I bet they give out medals to crybabies. Shut up. - Man up! - Hey! Hey... Hey, I want you to use that fear for fuel, huh, keep you going? All right? You can break down out there, but I need you in here. Mmm-hm. Yeah, you got it? - Yeah. - All right. It's not just the fear that's getting to him, it's the air. - It's all right. - Or lack of it. We're gonna suffocate in here if we don't get out. We're gonna get out. Hey. I already looked. The explosion's caused too much damage. Both ways out are completely walled up. Who's got a grenade? I do. Fire in the hole! St. John. Yeah, we got a crawlspace. It's tight, but I think we can make it. I think we better do this quick, or this place might cave. Wait, you're saying we go through that crawlspace and then come out the other side, get picked off one by one? Well, you got a better idea? Grey, help me take off this guy's uniform. You gonna dress up like a Nazi? Why not? Okay. Yeah, this could work. All right. What, you don't like the smell of Nazi scum? Son of a bitch, you look like a damn Nazi. One thing about Nazis, they're known for their uniformity. Plus, they don't know what I look like. Even if they did, I'll be wearing this. Let's go. - Equipment? - Leave it. - Let's go, let's go. - You want me to go in there? Yup. I don't think I'm gonna fit. Oh, you'll fit, now come on. The Nazis, of course. Grey, don't freak out on me back there. Ah! Holy crap. Cap, you all right? No, Cap, stop, stop, stop, you're going to get an infection. That's what they taught us in boot. Yeah, screw boot camp, I'm a damn Eagle Scout. All right, unless you want an infection in your arm from the bacteria in your saliva, go on, keep sucking away, but you don't even know if there's venom in it. Oh God this hurts. All right, let's just keep on moving, okay? Oh... Damn, got him. No, no, no, the morons think he's one of them. I don't like it. Stop. What are you doing? You're gonna blow his cover before he's even started. Stay calm. Elis? Achtung! Hey, hey, hey, St. John, why don't you come on? - Jesus. - Cap. I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah? Where's Eris? Is she still here? I saw the guards. They're leaving west. She's here. They're planning on launching some kind of operation tonight. All right, fellas, I need you to get in these Nazi uniforms quickly. Hey, you think that whole Clark Kent routine is gonna work? It worked for me. I'm the only one that knows German. What do we do if they question us? They won't, especially when they see our cargo. It should buy us enough time to infiltrate their base and rescue the doctor. Cargo? - I'll grab this officer. - St. John, don't bother. How am I gonna get inside? You're the cargo. Come on, fellas, let's go. Get changed quickly. So what, we're just gonna walk up to that front door and knock? Well, it's a little late to parachute through the roof, so.... Sure she's in there? Everything points to this being a research facility, not a military outpost. Look, there's no tanks, not even a team of watchmen. Why keep themselves so vulnerable to an attack if they can't even defend themselves? There must be some other defense system in place. That's probably why they brought the good doctor here. Remember, gentlemen, no aggression unless absolutely necessary. Right. - Jesus Christ. - Shit. Crazy bitch. Well, yes, I understand, but we probably shouldn't test it on them because of the.... Found her. Sure she wants to leave? Yeah, she seems pretty chummy with her new Nazi friends. She's been here for two months. You do whatever you have to do survive. What if she doesn't want to go? Then we kill the bitch. No, we need her alive, regardless if she's changed her morals or not. So what, we're just going to walk up to her and take her out, it's that easy? Yes. These are inexperienced soldiers. How old was the guard, 16? This is a research facility. Their greatest weapon is their intelligence, not their muscle. Yeah, all the big muscle already evacuated. Just what kind of operation are they planning here, anyway? Enough debate, let's go. Captain, your wrist. We'll bust through that door, I want you to shoot everyone that's not a doctor. Grey, you stay behind and watch the hall. Once we start shooting, who knows how many Nazis we're going to attract. You got it? Hey, he asked you a question. I got it. Don't scream. I'm Captain Alan Rogers from the United States Army. We're here to take you home. You hurt? - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm all right. Grey? Hallway's still empty, but we got to go. We need to go now. Are you the men from the cave? Wait, do you have Collins? Yes, he's here along with another man. - Brisco? - Perhaps. They brought them both in separately earlier today. They're keeping them downstairs. We can get in there through here. Do you hear that, Cap? They're alive. Our mission was to save the doctor. - We got her, now we got to go. - We need to save our men. Please, we can save your men and leave. - Let's go. - Someone's coming. Grey, close the door. We busted the lock. We cannot stay here, we got to go. Do you want to save your men or not? How do you get out of here? There's a ravine that leads down to a passage in the back. We can go through there. We use it for sewage. We can get out through there. Okay, let's go. Let's go. - Captain? - I said let's go. I can barricade the door once we're through. How did you even find me? We weren't the first guys looking for you. I know. I can't even contemplate the men who've come to look for me. I fear they died in vain. Why do think that? The Nazis trust me implicitly now, and of course I've been leading them completely off-track. You've been doing research for the Nazis? What they consider research. I mean, they... We must get to the laboratory. If they know you're here, they'll turn you into subjects. Subjects? You're soldiers. What are they doing to them? - What are you doing? - Are you one of them? It's a quarantine bell. It's to warn everyone that the contagion has gotten loose. Stand back. Come. All right. Go. Where are Collins and Brisco? What bit you? - A snake. - You mean a viper. It's not important. It will be once the poison reaches your heart. Here, here, give me your arm. Hey, where the hell are our men? I'll take you to them, but first we need to save your captain's life. Who else knows you're here? Our colonel. He gave us the mission after we stormed Normandy. Oh thank God you got to Normandy when you did. If you had been there one day later, you might have had a totally different outcome. Why do you say that? Give me your vein. Captain, if you die, there will be no one to lead your men, and I'll be in a worse position than I was when you came. Do you have any idea what the Nazis will do to me if I'm recaptured? It's a dry bite. There's no poison. Are you prepared to risk your life on that, or mine? Where is Collins? Please, take us to our men. In the five minutes that it would take me, you would be dead. I'm surprised his heart is still functioning with poison in his system. Captain, let her help you. If you die, I will never forgive myself. You've been through God knows what trying to save me. Please let me do this for you, please. What's in that? Thank you. No, Captain, thank you. Captain. Captain Rogers. I have good news. Your wound is healing nicely. You were right, it was a dry bite, no poison. They turned you into a Nazi. When I was a little girl, I had a nasty habit of not cleaning up my room. It used to aggravate my mother to no end. She would ask me and ask me to clean it. And sometimes I would, but not very well. And then one day, I came home to discover that all my of my things were gone: my clothes, my toys, even my bed. And at first, I thought that my mother must've just hidden them. But no, she had thrown everything out and burned it. I had to start over. But you know what I realized? I didn't miss any of those old things. I was ready for new toys and new joys, new wonders for me to discover. Why don't you let us out of here, you stupid bitch? The only way to make way for new wonders and new joys is to get rid of the old ones. That's the only way for a new evolution to occur for our race. The master race, huh? I knew it. You're as bad as Hitler. Yeah, I bet he buggers you. Is that what gets you off? I've never met the man, and quite frankly, I don't care to. I find his methods vile. What do you call this? What are your methods? What are you planning? The poison was meant to induce starvation and also encourage cannibalism. The Fuhrer liked the idea of his rivals eating each other alive. Stop it, you're psychotic. And they're not, the ones who ruined the world, the ones who destroyed all of its natural resources in an endless gluttony of greed? Death is not the answer. No, no, no, stop, no, Grey, don't... You don't know what you're drinking! Don't drink the water! Grey, that's an order, that's an order. I'm thirsty. I don't care. I don't care. I didn't poison the water. Dr. Eris? Bring in Patient C. That's one of ours. Woods. - Hose him down. - Woods. Oh, no. No, no... No, no, stop. I can't get any slack. Let me try yours. Van Straten? Doctor Van Straten. The viral load is near 100,000. He's about to pop. Open the chamber. You must be so scared, but you're a vessel. Just as the Messiah's blood cleanses our sins, so too does your blood cleanse the world, and for that I thank you. No, no. - What are you doing? - No, no. What are you doing? No. Open the hive. No. Why are you making us watch this? You don't find this curious? Pity. Let him out of there! Would a mild sedative help calm your nerves? Okay, that's enough. Engage the vacuum. Don't be angry, you'll be out soon. Bring in another man. Water for him, please. I forgot, an empty stomach will do that. Well, just know I tried to give you every comfort before.... No! Oh, don't eat it. Our analysis isn't prepared for that effect. Why didn't you test one of the healthy men first? They wanted us to eradicate the camps first. Believe me, it wasn't my choice. Bring in another man from the pit. Wait. It's starting. It works, it really works. But that could've been because he just ate the bug. No, it bit him, I know it did. Our studies are not prepared for the ingestion of the specimen. His stomach acids would have destroyed the bug. We specifically manufactured the plague to be carried by the blood stream... - I'm not sure. - ...not through ingestion. I'm not sure. Proceed to the next stage. I'm not sure. Proceed. Prepare for the final experiment. Which means I must get ready, too. So which one will it be, Captain? Excuse me? Which one of your men do you want me to test first? Me. - No. - Test me. - No, no! - You're not an option. God damn it, let us go. Him? What? Hmm, an interesting choice. - I didn't choose anyone. - Captain? I didn't choose anyone, I swear, I swear. I didn't choose anyone, I swear. No, captain, captain, no! Come on, help me! Come on! The struggle is good for the autonomic nervous system, pumps up muscles, makes the veins easier to find and drill into. Open the hive. Cap, come on! Haas! Haas! Engage the vacuum, 85 percent power. Is this how you're going to win your war, take over the world with your sick plague? Haas! Haas! Engaging vacuum, 100 percent power. It's all right. Don't. It works. I really am immune to the virus. I am pure! Proceed with separation of the hives. The locusts will live for only another 24 hours. Thank you. This plan will never work. Oh, Captain, it's already done. The world as you know it is no more. So your bugs can fly around the world in 24 hours? No, but our planes can. Tokyo, Paris, London, New York, Chicago. We'll start in the Northern Hemisphere, and then the natural progression of the contagion will move south. Wait. You said you weren't going to kill us. No, Captain, I said I wasn't going to kill you. Collins? Collins, is that you? Jesus Christ, what did they... Damn it, Sam, it's me, Billy. St. John, grab one of their arms. I'll grab the other, we got to pull them apart. No, we can save them. We can save them! Billy! Sam, they're.... - Stop. - Shoot. I said stop. Why won't you shoot me? Pull! No! John, there's no other way. No, we can save them. We have to save them. St. John, it's the only way. We need to pull them apart. You bastards! No! Hold on to me. St. John! Hold on to me. St. John, help me save her. You're saving her? No, no, we need her. She's no good to us dead. She created the plague, she'll know how to stop it. You'll never stop it. Yes, I can. - You'll never stop it. - I have to. - Not you. - Yes, I can. Not you. St. John, St. John.... St. John? Collins? Collins? Collins. - St. John. - You're alive. St. John. Kill me. No, no, we can fix this. We can fix this. I'll never be the same. Kill me. No, don't you give up on me, Sam. Please, please. St. John... Make the pain end. Please make the pain end. Make the pain end. Shit. The locusts. There's only one patch of land nearby to land a plane. That has to be where that Von Straten is heading. I bet my life on it. Hey, there's another Nazi helmet and a jacket back there. Have they loaded the bugs yet? Not yet. There's two of us against the world, Cap. Better odds than David had against Goliath. He was one man. Don't focus on how many there are of them. All we got to do is stop that plane from taking off. Or die trying, huh? That's what we signed up for. My dad signed me up. He's counting on you. I lied to you. I did run away. I know. That's what second chances are for. Collins tried to stop me. Everyone thinks it was the other way around, and he was the one that wanted to run, but it was me. It was me. None of that matters anymore. What matters is you're here with me. We're not going anywhere. I killed my best friend, Cap. So what are you gonna do about it? All we got to do is take out that plane? Just one plane. How simple's that? Too goddamn simple. Child's play. You got a good plan? Only if it's better than yours. Die! No! No! Captain! Captain, burn me! Burn me! Kill me! I'm alive. I'm alive. Surely you must have seen some of her formulas. You came back with some of her calculations? Look, do you have any idea the military advantage this Eris research could give us? It's okay, it's okay, don't worry. It's okay if we use it. See, we're the good guys, we are. We can use it, we're the good guys. Come on. The president will see you now. That's the president. Snap out of it, let's go. Come on. I wanted to thank you personally for everything you did for the country, the entire world overseas, although personally, I haven't forgiven you for resigning and taking up civilian life so quickly. Thank you, Alan. Son, are you okay? This is why she didn't kill me. I was her failsafe. Oh my God. - This man needs help. - Someone get a doctor. Get away from me. Stay away from me. Someone get a medic. Medic! This is what she wanted. They're still gonna win. They're still gonna win. They're still gonna win. They're still gonna win. Get down, get down. Subtitles by explosiveskull
