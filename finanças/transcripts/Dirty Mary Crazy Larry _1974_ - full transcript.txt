You've been holding those cars over my head a year now, and I'm getting tired of it. You know, Ev, lot of times I actually enjoy your making things harder for me. But this ain't in the same category as your refusing to wear a gun or a badge. Oh, Carl, come on. Will you stop watching them Hollywood TV shows? I mean, what the hell is the difference how I cut my hair Or how I dress or if I wear a badge or a gun? Is that important? Well, I'm not standing up in no more meetings and defending you.

She gets too scared, and she comes running home to Grandfather's pickup. - And you know all it takes to scare you? - What? Little old me. Well, Mister, things felt a little too good for you last night, so you ran. And I'll tell you something else. You don't know how to say hello, and you don't know how to say goodbye. All right, I didn't say goodbye. I had a robbery to pull this morning, woman! Well, all right. It's not actually the goodbyes. What pisses me is you didn't even leave me a clean towel! Oh, God, if it hadn't been the goodbyes, if it hadn't been the towels, it would've been something else. You know why? Because that's the kind of person you are. You know that? You're the kind that's never satisfied. You'd eat the last cookie in the jar! And I'm telling you something...there's no more cookies in the jar, and there aren't. But even if there was, you'd eat it! And you'd go looking in my fridge for my pie stash! That is totally untrue! That is totally true. You listen to me. You are crazy! You are totally bananas.

I don't know why, but you got it. This is Franklin. Are you the UPI reporter man? Uh, you want a statement? OK, here it is. Uh, quote: "I admire any man who tries to get anything he wants "any way he can as long as it's legal. "I may be a little old-fashioned, "but I believe in law and order. "So this poor son of a bitch better start thinking, 'cause this is my territory, and I'm gonna get him." Uh... yeah, OK. Well, unquote it now. And see if you get the word "son of a bitch" in print. Shit! Damn wire's wrapped in too tight for me to get a hold of it. Terrific. This is what you're gonna do for me in Riverside? Say "shit" and pull a fade? Tell her to start moving the wheel. Hey!

And the way you're driving, I'd say you raced... roundy rounders. Bumper cars... - Roundy rounders? Give me that thing. You do that, and he'll know it's two-way. What do you think he's trying to find out? Probably didn't race none at all. Maybe you just wished you did, huh? - Huh? - Oh, yeah. Right on. Give me a piece of paper. - Hm? - Give me a piece of paper. And a pencil. He knows we're just waiting for him to break up that roadblock. That's all right. Little Miss Mary's gonna do us a favor.

What do you mean? What I've been trying to tell you ever since you got in this thing. We haven't got any fuel left. [screaming] I'll kill him! I'll kill him! You probably did. Aw, jeez. Let's go fix up that front end. Hey, wait a minute. Fix up the front end? People don't even rate a glance with you. God, woman. When you're racing, you don't stop and get out of the car and turn around to find out if the other guy made it through a spin all right. Not if you want to keep on driving. Jesus. Don't bring it on the road. - Huh? - Just take it in. Yeah. Franklin to Mary Coombs. Franklin to Mary Coombs. Mary, are you ready to go back to the joint? 'Cause that's what parole violators get.

I'm ready and willing to make you a deal. I've got a way maybe you save yourself, Mary. Come in, Mary. [switches radio off]Mary ghost? Turns out dingleberry here is a joke after all. - Oh, I am, am I? - Mm...hm. Well, you know what you are? A case of eye-and-hand coordination. And you're not really very good at that, are you? I mean. Aah! Don't you do that again, ever! Well, if she has any sense about her, I won't need to. What's the matter? You're so used to not being able to get up by yourself You don't think anybody else can, huh? Say it again. Come on! Say it again! Just fix the goddamn wheel. Hey. Did a Dodge Charger do that? Yeah. Or I think so. All I saw was a yellow flash. - Thataway? - Yeah. Hey! Wait a minute! Why? I'm his mechanic. So what? You don't have to be. Well, I mean, you said half the money's yours, right? You and I, we could... Wait, I don't want you to think it's the money. It's not that... not that at all. And I know... you think I lie. Well, I do lie a little. That's wrong, also. I lie all the time. But the reason I lie... The reason... I know you, Miss Mary. You do? Wait. Why don't you go back and work for Sam Baker? And take me with you. I mean, you're good. Even I know that. Why do you keep thinking being good is the whole story? Anyway, I couldn't. I... I drank myself right out of the entire circuit. You don't have to be here, Miss Mary. You really don't have to be here. I don't have anything else to do. You know, this whole thing's funny. I mean... It's beginning to drift down that you don't think I'm gonna make it. Yeah, but I always think that. Now, let's get on with our business. Huh? Hank to Franklin. Hank to Franklin. I picked them up again at Bridge 69. Coordinates: 38, Minus 3.

I'm gonna eat your lunch, you long-haired faggot. He's staying with you. Yeah, you better get out. I'm gonna put you right up against a wall. What's he got under that hood? Driver's no slouch, either. If he gets any closer, I'm gonna lynch him. Well, come on, sic him! Hey, Deke. You remember Robert Mitchum in Thunder Road? Yeah! I'm gonna powder his face. You want to do a little dirt tracking, huh, hot rod? It's gonna take more than that to cut me off, 'cause it's where I came from! I'm gonna show you about driving this time, buddy. Keep going, partner, 'cause my top end is unlimited. Damn! This is Hank to Headquarters. Hank to Headquarters. Come in, please. [dispatcher] This is Headquarters. Go ahead, Car 10. I almost had them.

Stay on it, now. Franklin to Charger. You're minenow, clown. I'm telling you, park it now and make it easy on yourself. You're just wasting gas. All right, it's up to you. What is? I want them stopped. Stopped? How? I don't know how. I wouldn't be asking you if I knew how to operate this machine, now, would I? Now, you listen to me, flyboy. I want them stopped. I don't give a good goddamn if you got to crash right into them. You hear me? Because if you don't, you're gonna start screaming "Mayday," 'cause I'm gonna give it a try. So, go on down there. I said, go on down there! Come on! Bunky, I believe he wants us to pull over. Let me talk to him. Clown to Franklin. Clown to Franklin. Come in, clown.

Hey, would you ask him to stop calling me dingleberry? Oh, he doesn't mean anything by it. It's just another word. You know what? I think I'm ready to unload.
