[ Man ] Storefront Hitchcock-- [ voices overlapping ] [ Man ] The most important thing in the world-- it's sitting on the couch. It's got spikey hair. It's defiant. It's filling itself with garbage. It's got garbage in little pots, and it's eating it. As it expands, it begins to eat itself as well. It feeds on itself. It feeds on its own excrement. It's delighted. It's very, very happy. The more it comes out, the more it rubs into its hair. It's really pleased. It doesn't say hello when its parents walk into the room. It's that defiant. [ People laughing ] It raids the fridge completely disrespectfully. It may take, you know, two or three pickles out of the jar at a time. It stares out of the window. It doesn't wear its glasses in bad light. It smokes cigarettes. Sometimes it blunders into a manhole... And spends days walking through the sewers. But its not repentant. When it finally comes home, there's no, "hello, mom. Hello, dad. Where have I been?" It's just, "I stink, and you're pleased to see me."

[ Applause ] ♪ [ Checks tuning ] [ Muttering ] If you stand up properly, it's possible to make yourself-- there's these techniques called Alexander technique... For actors and people who have incredibly bad posture... But enough money to try and get over it. You can actually make yourself grow two or three inches by doing this stuff correctly. They align you as if your spine was an endless plate of crockery. They kind of line it up properly so that it won't tip. Most of our spines zigzag heinously, and, in fact, you can go up for miles. As you know, people get taller. The average human height increases by one and a half inches every 100 years. Julius Caesar would have only come up to your pelvis. You could have broiled him, you know. He would have been no trouble. Those legions were just midgets. I went to an astrologer's house in wherever that place is... With the Rose-colored rocks-- Arizona. It was built for astronomers in the fifth century b.C. All the doors were really tiny. They were about the size of cucumber frames-- the height, anyway. So I pictured all these cucumbers going into the astronomer's house... And kind of spiraling up the stairs and then looking out. Anyway, what they were planning to do is make people-- because people were eating more and more pure beef, which, as you know, is probably the best possible food stuff that the world can produce. But one of the reasons that we were created-- that Siemens and glaxo and virgin and Disney got together and said, "let there be humanity"-- was that so we could eat beef. And I'm very proud of our wonderful country that they haven't forgotten that. [ Sparse applause ] Thank you. Let's just hope that the conservatives got in again, shall we? If you're watching this in the future, I come from a time when there was a two-party system. But things have glibbed towards an inevitable monopoly. People haven't complained about the eastern bloc being a monopoly for years. This is exactly what's happened in the west. There's now just-- when the final big fish fillets the last medium-sized fish... And absorbs it-- [ Makes swishing sound ] Like that, there will just be one big fish with a distended stomach. Anyway, back to the beef. Let's not forget this. People are supposed to be just getting bigger and bigger. As you know, Neil Armstrong was 7 foot 7. If you've been to the Smithsonian, you've seen that those capsules-- the Mercury capsule and the gemini capsule-- they're very tiny. They actually look like the stonehenge in the spinal tapthing... Where it comes down on a spider's web. [ Laughter ] But this is a posthumous public relations thing by NASA. In fact, these men were giants, because they were put into-- also, actually in Arizona-- they were put into a government site... And fed irradiated, carbonated beef for two years, and they became very tall. Their capsules were huge. Anyway, they're planning for the rest of US to follow suit.

It's like, if you meet somebody named Martha, they say, "this is Martha." I mean, you know, that person happens to be known as Martha, just as I might be called bloomingdale's... Or deni might be called staten island. But that's really the beginning of the story. Martha is a whole mass of molecules and complexes... And things bound together by terrifying physical improbabilities. The truth is, she could fly apart at any moment, like some terrible pent-up lock that's waiting to snap... And spatter her psyche across the universe. God knows-- it is disgusting, deni. It's life. If it weren't for our rib cages, there would just be spleens a-go-go. I mean, people are just held in by all this stuff, and then they're called, almost insultingly, a single name. It's the same with a song. I could say what the song's called, which isn't going to be much of a clue, unless you've heard it before. Or I can explain what it's about, and I'm going to be lying. So, in the end, there's not much point in it really. Ah, that's interesting. There's some people polishing a gun carriage over there. One of those brass 18th century things for storing in time capsules. There's a very thin line between torture and cosmetics. [ Laughter ] [ Chuckles ] I wonder-- now's our chance to cross it.

And maybe, coming down the aisle, there's two kind of... Proto-carcasses with their hacked and mangled digits... Bonded together in a bloody welt, and they're being clubbed by a priest. [ Clapping, laughter ] Now, let it come, brother. Let it come. And, um, that's what we're here for. We're testifying. We don't know what for, but we're testifying to something. And, you know, outside the church there's even more carcasses, who hopefully are at rest. Above the church there is sort of a huge mega-carcass... With a long white beard and a top hat... Who's going, "well done, my children." There's another who's on his mobile phone to the bloke in the vestry... Or whatever it is, who says, "I think we got more in than usual, lord."

Very seldom do divine forces actually wreak their vengeance on you, but it's very dangerous to be an infidel in someone's eyes. I believe very firmly in god, in terms of spirituality.

The penalty is that you're transported from here by two minotaurs, which, as you know, are human up to the neck, and then they have bulls' heads. Uh, they have real bulls' heads. They're not just wearing bull-head masks. They actually become bull from the neck up. The minotaurs have a lot of duct tape, and they swaddle you in it. Or gaffer tape, if you're watching in england. You're swaddled in duct tape, and you're carried away by the two minotaurs... Down an endless series of ducts. Then you're pinpointed just above about... 2,723 feet above sea level, and you are fired out over central London. Then you come down. It's the reverse of normal gravity. It actually gets slower as you get nearer to the ground. So you run out of momentum about eight feet above Leicester square. And everybody thinks that you're a bomb-- a thermonuclear device-- 'cause we've always been brought up in our folk stories in britain... That the bomb would detonate above ground to achieve maximum devastation. So as they see this thing, which is you, swaddled in duct tape, coming down over central London, people begin to flee. [ Laughter ] There's enormous traffic congestion, especially on the a4... But also on some of the other main routes, like the beginning of the a1-- whatever it's called-- highbury corner and all that stuff. It gets more and more cluttered, and people are fleeing. They're starting to tread on each other in their panic. They're spilling cups of honey and knocking over theodolites... And retort stands and trivets and all those sorts of things. A lot of people are blundering through ancient chemical apparatus. There's stuff that people have got-- people with slides-- you know, slides of tissue. Things like corroded lungs. They're spilling that in their panic. They're saying, "just one more cup of coffee, Ms. Patterson." Then it's getting spilled as well, and they're getting more disturbed. And rubber tires, which have never seen the outside of a wheel-- they're just cosmetic-- come smashing through the venetian blinds, and they knock over the paper cups and they hit the files, and the computers all go blank and the buildings, begin to shake. They notice there's something wrong underground, so they have a strike underground. Hundreds of passengers are trapped underground... As you get closer and closer to the surface.
