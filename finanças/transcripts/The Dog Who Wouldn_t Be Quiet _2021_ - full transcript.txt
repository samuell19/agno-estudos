- Luis... - Hello, how are you? - How are you? - Fine. - Is everything all right? - So, so. - What's wrong? - No, it's that... I want us to talk a bit about the puppy. - About the dog? - Yes, I can't take it anymore. - It's crazy. Can I come in for a minute? - Yes, sure, sure. Watch out here. - May I...? - Come in. If I wasn't in the situation I find myself in... I'm going through a rough patch. - I'm very upset about all this. - Right, right. Otherwise I wouldn't ask you, I wouldn't mention this to you. - I think-- - Give me a minute, I'm getting wet. I'll go get an umbrella and be right back. - Hello, Luis. - Hi. It's very moving. She just doesn't stop. It's an awful situation. I'm heartbroken. I don't know what to do. That animal keeps crying all the time. We need to do something, we can't go on like this. I'm thinking about it, sometimes at night, because... - It hurts. - How could it not? It fucks you up! It's crazy. Can you imagine, that poor animal on her own all the time? It's too much, it's not easy. Sorry. - Hello. - Hello, how are you? So so... - Because of the dog? - Yes, right. I can't explain what we feel as neighbors. I can imagine, yes. Look, I... I was researching on the internet what happens with lonely dogs... Hi. - How are you, Quique? - Hi, what's up? - How are you, Luis? - Hi, how are you? I think you can do something, there are a lot of things to be done. One of the things I read is that when they're alone for too long, the dogs might remember their mother or a sibling. The dog is eight years old now, so I think it's kind of... I've been listening to her for four years! You can't imagine what that's like! It kills you, it drives you insane! You have to do something... I have done things, I bought the food dispenser that doles out her food. - In doses... - Right. - It gives her-- - I don't think it's the food. - No, I don't think so. - No, it's something else. - It kills me, that animal feels lonely. - Yes, yes. - It's heartbreaking. - It's a bad vibe. Yesterday I was listening to music and she started crying and I thought: "My God, what's wrong with her?" - I'll get you some water. - No, there's no need. - I'll get it. It's just a second. - Really, there's no need. - Here. - Thank you. What a mess! Rita! Rita...! Come here, here... - Do you want something to drink? - No, no, thanks. No? Some coffee? A cup of tea? Water. - No, no, leave it. - OK. She wants to do everything. - Thank you very much. - Water. OK, how are you? Fine. - There's a lot of work, right? - A lot, yes. - This week was hard. - Yes, as was last week. - But it's okay. - It's the busiest time which is fine too. Well... We had a "telling off" from upstairs, Pablo Zárate... called me about the dog. So... To summarize, you cannot bring a dog to work. - It's not the place for it. - No. - It is because she peed here? - No! No, but, let's see... It's... It goes beyond that but it's not good for a dog to pee in an office. - It all adds up. - It does. - We wanted to ask if you had options... - Sure... Someone who'd look after the dog. Yes, yes. No... I can't think of anyone right now. I can arrange for her to stay at someone's house once a week. No, but, not for one day... No, if it was anyone else that came to us with this... - We wouldn't have been so lenient. - She's already used to being here. My colleagues are very happy with her. Your colleagues are... But I can't abide it. Otherwise anything can happen. - Yes, anything can... - Whatever they want. There's no parameter stating what you can bring into the office. Martín could bring his grandfather who's ill and can't be left on his own. Or Mariano could come in dressed as a woman. I'm not saying he dresses as one. I mean that anything could happen. We'd end up with an office full of hens, and everyone pole dancing. - It can't be done. - Maybe in some other place, I don't know. I was reading that in Quebec, and some other places, they're setting it up so that people can take their dog to work, because this is a generalized problem. - We can't do it. - But this is not the case. What do you think? I'm interested in what you think about this. Of course. I could try to not bring her everyday. No, you don't understand. - That's not, he doesn't understand... - If you have to... If you have to bring the dog you don't have to come anymore. To have the fact that you've been fired on record... Isn't good. Plus we can't fire you, because to come here with the dog isn't... There's no reasonable cause, get it? What's the cause? The dog. - You'd have to send us a... - Telegram. Fine. - From Tuesday on? - From Tuesday on, from Wednesday actually. - But I come in on Tuesday? - Come in on Tuesday and on Wednesday... If I can finish it at home at the weekend and send it over. - You don't want to come on Tuesday. - No, yes, yes, maybe it's better for you. - Yes, yes. - I'll have the same issue on Tuesday. - Sure. - So... - I opened it. - Yes. I saw the green thing but I don't know. Did you mean this one? - Yes, yes. - This one... - Because there's another one in the back. - No, no, it's there. Look... You unscrew this. There's no water here, there should be water here. Obviously. - You lift... See how if starts flowing? - Yes. - Hold it here. I'm going to turn it on. - Yes. - If water starts flowing, let me know. - Yes. - I'll come down and we'll start it up again. - OK. If water starts to flow, it means it's fixed and we screw it tight again. - We'll listen for the tank to fill up. - Fine. It's flowing! - Right away. - That's right. If it starts flowing, it's fine. - Now put it back there. - It's heavy. - Check how it goes in. - Yes. If air gets in there, there will be trouble. That's it. Then you switch it on, it will start up and you listen for the tank to fill up. - If you go nearby you can hear it. - It was easy. - I didn't want to touch just in case. - No problem. If you run out of water due to the power you can get some from the windmill. I didn't know that. Check how it moves and then it starts spinning. This tank should always be full because it's... Sure. - That's it. - Plus, there's always wind blowing here. Fantastic. You're developing skills beyond an Illustrator. Some, yes... - How are you? - My life? You mean? - Yes. - Fine, fine. Whenever I was here for a long time, this place is overwhelming. - It's silent here. - Yes... Yes, but I like it. I even like it better here. - This arugula is delicious. - Is it good? Actually, what has to be done here is... a bit of weeding... and to begin to turn the soil over and prepare it for sowing in spring. - Do we use the same soil? - We can see later if we need more... We'd be fine. How do we do it with regards to August...? Should I give you cash or transfer it? Cash would be better for me. Because I forgot to bring cash. I have some, but... I'll give you what I have and if I don't transfer it, I'll send the rest later on. Fine, fine, that's fine. Because I forgot. What a beautiful friendship day! - That's so long! - I think he's making it up, it's too long. How do you say "Zoe"? - How do you say what? - Zoe... What about you, Pili, do you know any words? Nothing? Nothing. I've told her that when we travel... English! Yes, in the city we can use English, but if we go inland, somewhere... Say "What a beautiful day". - Can we spoon tonight? - Yes. A lot. Your journey can start on your cellphone, is up to you. We renewed it to be more connected. New design, more info and more features. Word search magazine, plus the pen to fill it in, all for 20 pesos. Good morning, how are you? Sorry for the intrusion. This an excellent chance to purchase writing instruments. Ballpoint pen with a retractile system, and special adherence when it comes to writing. Metallic reinforced tip in high impact Bakelite. I also brought you... Oblique tip highlighter... To highlight texts, notes, spreadsheets, three highlighters for only 50 pesos. It's an excellent opportunity... Was she your best friend? No, she was a beloved friend, a good person. She wasn't my best friend. We're here. Put your gloves on. Put them on, we almost missed our station again. - Put your gloves on. - We're here. Come on, it's cold. Let's go. Hold my hand. Come on. Next station, Darío Santillán y Maximiliano Kosteki. Fine. - Let's sit down and talk for a bit. - Yes, yes. Things are tough here, you know? I don't know... It's very hard, we're not hiring. I even think they're gonna fire people. You asked me to come in, so I thought there may have been a chance for me. Who told you to come? To come by one of these days. Me? I told you...? Sometimes there are things but... No, no, no. The thing with graphic design is that they think anyone can be a designer. They ask the IT guy, the receptionist's boyfriend, I don't agree, but... - Fine. - Yes, yes, yes. - OK, Sebas, let's talk... - Yes, yes. - We'll talk. - Great. He doesn't want us to send the letter? He wants us to lighten the tone. We can't do everything that he wants. - We can't live in fear. - No! - That's what he wants. - Of course, sure. - He doesn't want to commit to anything. - How do we "lighten it up"? Synonyms? For example, one of the things that bugged him... - Hi. - Hello, Sebas... It bugged him that... Hello, son. - ...that it said... - Did you sleep well? - Yes. - "It's public knowledge". - Hello. - Hi. - Had you met him? He's my son. - No. - Sebastián... - I met him when he was ten and I remember... - He's my only child. - Beautiful. - He's here for a few days. - Gorgeous. You can't imagine how well he wrote. He was a ray of sunshine. I was certain you'd be a writer. Do you still write, Sebas? No. No, no. - And he's here for a few days... - They are phases, just phases... - Come on, let's be clear, girls... - What should we write? Let's be clear, he has never committed to anything, nor will he... Excuse me, are you staying for lunch? - Oh, yes. - He'll cook Moussaka, do you like it? It's... Vegetables, vegetables... - Yes, fine. - You should buy him a restaurant. - Thanks. - Fine, listen... - What will we do? - Hold on, let me explain. Catalina was also there, but she didn't want to talk much. He told me I was nervous. How can he say I am nervous? He's nuts! - But that's... - I don't know, he mixes everything up. I had an incident with a boy who threw a flowerpot, and I told him rightly so. You know what it is? The union did this and he doesn't like that. - He just doesn't want a strike. - No, he doesn't. - What about wages? - For me a wage is a wage, that's it. - If he doesn't like it, tough. - Then we leave it like this. In this context, teachers at primary school level support this demand. In our specific case, we support the reasons behind it, considering that... - the wage proposed... OK? - Yes, we leave wage, as we agreed. But the Education Department, is still way below what we should get. Well below, we will underline that five times. We hope you can understand and heed our demand. Thank you, because without this, we're dead. Well, let's see... Before I forget, I have to leave now. I have to go to the doctor and... Don't forget the morphine drops. - Every four hours. - They're diluted, every four hours. Check it, if he's really in pain before the four hours give it to him anyway. The doctor said we have to space it, it's on demand, that's the demand. I have to go to the doctor and I remembered I have to take the CT scan and the exams. - Go, Mara, everything will be fine. - All right, yes. - Don't forget the drops. - No, no. Every four hours. - Put a bit of sweetener on them. - Yes, yes, don't you worry. - Please... - We'll be fine. Finish eating the apple, sweetheart. OK? Can you come over for a second? Just one second. I'll be right back. I'm trying to do my best. But I'm so angry! It hurts me, I don't know what to do! I try to help him but sometimes he doesn't answer... What can I do? I swear, I'm so angry... - Yes, it's very sad. - I'm devastated! It's a shitty disease! It's shit! I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - No, it's alright. I'm exhausted! It hurts a lot. It's not fair! It's not fair, it's not fair that this should happen to him! Are you okay? Yes, I'm... I'll be fine. - Bye, have fun. - Bye, Mara. Be well. Tulio... What do you want to do? Should we go out? Check that out. See how sunny it is? Is this route okay? Great. Great, so now you're driving. Julio! Do you have it in gear? - Stop for a minute. - Excuse me. - Is it broken? Do you need help? - No, no, it's just that... - Why not? Let him push. - Yes, yes, I'll help. Julio, put it in neutral. - Let's go. - Go on, push. Go, go, go. There's no point, it won't work. - What is it? A greengrocer's? - No, no. - Fuck! - Because I'm looking for a job. We're not looking to hire. We work as a cooperative. - What do you do? - I... a bit of everything. Whatever I can find. Do you like working the land? I do, I do. I'm interested, if... Should we push the truck? Let's go. - Come on, Julio, let's go. - Piece of shit! - Wait until it goes down. Come on! - We have to get the incline. There it goes! - Come on, everybody, push! - Come on! Go! - Is it a new cellphone? - No! No, in fact the "a" doesn't work well. - How do you write? - Press it, the screen is broken there. That's it, that's it. I said we're coming. All right. It takes good pictures? Did you take those pictures with it the other day? - Yes. - Thanks. - You didn't send me the pictures. - I got mandarin all over it. I'll send them now. That's what I want. A cellphone with a good camera. - That's the most important thing. - The other features... You can send your location to those people. We can send our location. - I told them we're almost there. - I sent them. - In time... - You sent them? - Again? - Just a message saying we're almost there. - I did it. - Forget I said it. Don't fight. I'll give you 100 pesos for a bite of this small part. - Cut it then. - I'll give you... Cut it. - You'll do it for 80? - I'll do it for 80. You for 100, and you for 80, one bite for each. - You damn capitalist! - You're evil. Once again! I want more, I want more. You don't look at anyone. Oscar, Gonzalo, Andrea, Néstor, Yoli, Mimí, Muriel, Adrián, Pipí. - Pipi... - Pipi, not Pipí. - You have to pull it that way, that way! - There's too much wind! When we said this business had no glass ceiling we were right. - Is there any bag that's not ready? - No, it's all fine. - I don't know, Oscar wanted... - Just eggplants? Yes, he wanted only eggplants. Give me. Here's another one for Oscar. - This one must be for Oscar. - Do you have another one? - We're fine. - Come on, take it. Give me the box. Take this one first. - Oscar, Oscar. - Oscar, Oscar. - It says 150. - Open the lock. - Watch it! - This has no name on it. - OK, let's go. - Gonzalo. There it goes, watch it. - What do we have? - Hello, good afternoon. Watch your hand. Yoli, Yoli... - Can I charge you now? - Yes, yes, I'm ready. - Alicia! - Pipi! Do you have the money? There you are. - Who's missing their bag? - Done. That's mine. - There you are. - Thank you. - Oscar! - Eggplants for Oscar. Go, go, go... This is yours. Mimi... Have your money ready, please. Go, go, go! Hop in, hop in. - Let's go. - Fine, go, go, go. Cooperative, 6h 29m 6h 29m The introduction of conventional crops in a capitalist market model presents a scenario where soil is over-exploited. Is it possible that "doing your duty" justifies everything? Is that enough? Carlos, can you tell us how you think a person who does that feels? I don't know how they can call that work, because frankly... Common sense should really prevail. I think that... If I was in their place I'm not sure I could sleep soundly, as you said. There's something about this... I have a lot questions. Things to do with work. What is...? What do we call work? With this and also... the guy who delivers food and skips red lights... Or speeds to deliver a pizza for someone they don't even know and they risk their lives like that. Some of you know this, and others don't. I'll tell it anyway. We met on the subway, here in the city. And the subway suddenly... stopped. It was 100 degrees inside, all closed in. It stopped in between stations. Many people started screaming, five minutes later I was also screaming and... I suddenly looked over at him who was also screaming with his hair flying about. The doors were closed. We couldn't even leave the subway. So... After all that the only thing left to do was to calm down because the doors were closed. We were walking on the platform and we kept complaining and... I suddenly realized that I was complaining with him and him with me. - The next day we met for coffee... - Coffee... Bravo! I remember how happy I was when I saw him walking towards the coffee shop. One of the things I always believed all the years that I was single and I used to say I was happy to be single, alone and with my things. I always thought my son Seba... was the only unconditional love I had. He is leaving and now I have another one. Nothing else, let's dance and do other stuff. Yes, come on. Let's have a drink, let's dance and relax. Thank you. - Should we sleep in a bit more? - It's too hot. Should I open it? -"Extranieri", with an "n"? - Yes. - Hello. - Hi. Hello. - "Inquinato", with a "c" or a "q"? - With a "q". - Bye. - Bye. Look at the sky! It's pretty. Did you see that? - Go see, Carlitos? - I'm going to take a picture. Migue... Here you are. Cami, here's the extension cord. Here's the gray one, I don't know where the black ones are. They're the ones I found. The rubber stamp... I didn't... I don't know. I don't know. I didn't find the ink pad. Thank you. Thank you. - Great. Do you have a lot to do? - No. No? I need you to go up again to look for a folder like this but green. - Green. - I left it up there the first day. Can you go right now? I'll try and close earlier today. - How are you coping? - I get agitated. It will pass, it will pass. - What? - It will pass. - It will pass. - It will pass. Can you hear me? It's normal, it will pass. You'll get used to it. - Fine. - Can you go? - Yes, right away. - Thanks. Watch out! As a family, it's important you don't pass on your own fears. They were born in this world. For them this is the world, right? So... 25 inches! Huguito, that's good. Let's see. What a strong baby! You've a while to go until four ft. Right, there's a ways to go. A way to go before four ft. On the other hand, in less than a year we'll go back to normal, God willing. But, in case we can buy the bubble, is it better for Hugo to develop? Yes, although in the US there were kids who couldn't adapt to it. Is his life at risk without the bubble? No, as long as you don't expose him above the four ft. Which is the protocol. - Taking the ground as the reference. - So, excuse me for asking again... The bubble is not vital? No. There shouldn't be any problem. But it's better to have it. - It's a lot of money. - Yes, but it's good to know. What scares me is... He'll start crawling soon. Then to walk and hold on to things. - He can climb the... - You must watch the kid. Just as usual. It's a totally normal childhood. Very well... - Fine. - Thanks. What's that? Sorry. I used all our savings. He's our son. He's my son, I want him to have a good life. I understood you, I hope now you can understand me. I can't take this anymore, Sebas. I can't stand it anymore. Hello, my love. Look what I got you! Should we try? You'll like it, you'll be able to do anything. Yes, honey, you'll be able to jump, run... You'll be able to climb trees. Yes? Can you help me? Let's see, baby, come and try it. Let's see, my love. Should we put it on? It was only six months, they told us. - Who is it? - Sebas... - Hello. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine, and you? Fine. He's coming. Hugo... How are you? - Look. - How they climb? Look at the dogs. I read the text and I was thinking... Yes, I agree with what Maru said. And I'd also highlight "This is not a text to underline", "NO" in capitals. Asserting that this is not a text to highlight. Yes, yes. Mati? It's a way to emphasize what shouldn't be done but is done anyway. It doesn't stand out, but it does stand out. Good. I think it's also about thinking new ways. We already learnt it and saw it in the exam also... ways to highlight a text. These are the well-known ways to do it I think it would be great for you to think not necessarily here, at some point if you like... If you want... I'll pay you for today and for last Tuesday. - Goal! - Fine. Did you change the tab? I think this tastes a bit weird. - What does? - The water... I don't know, even... - It smells a bit funny. - Like chlorine? You have to check the instructions, You have to change a few things. - Yes. - Because otherwise it's no good. - It's as if you'd done nothing. - I don't know when I changed it last. Maybe that's what it is. You must put the tab that's appropriate. Yes, but I also think they cleaned the building's water tank. Maybe that's why. Have you gone out yet? Did you take out Popi? The three of us went out in the morning. - We're practicing. - I can see. Excellent head control. There were some peaches that I threw out... - because they had alien life on them. - Yes, yes, thank you. I was going to throw them away, and I forgot. All right. In two weeks, I won't be able to come on Tuesday to stay. All right. I'm going to Chascomús to celebrate a birthday with some friends. - Great. - It's beautiful this time of year. - Come here. - With your poetry group? - Yes, with the poetry group. - Fantastic. We'll have a poetic weekend, but I'll tell you again so you won't forget. - Yes. Did you say next week? - No, the week after. - In two weeks. - The other one, let me know next week. Oh, that puppy... - Should I water the plants? - No. - It's big. - It's growing. THE DOG WHO WOULDN'T BE QUIET
