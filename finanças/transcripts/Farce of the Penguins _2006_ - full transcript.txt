Subtitles provided by Defender452 [ ??? ] Male voice: [ Narrating ] I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU A BEAUTIFUL STORY; A STORY THAT TAKES PLACE SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY. A PLACE WHERE THE TEMPERATURE IS 58 DEGREES BELOW ZERO. IT IS THE COLDEST, DARKEST, MOST BARREN PLACE ON EARTH. I'M TALKING ABOUT ANTARCTICA. ANTARCTICA: YOU CAN GET THERE FROM HERE, BUT IT'S QUITE A JOURNEY. YOU'LL WANT TO BRING A SWEATER, OR MAYBE LET YOUR PUBIC HAIR GROW REALLY LONG, AND WRAP IT AROUND YOUR TESTICLES. IT'S THAT COLD. IF YOU'RE A WOMAN, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TESTICLES, SO YOU'D PROBABLY LET YOUR PUBIC HAIR GROW REALLY LONG AROUND YOUR VAGINA. WHATEVER YOUR GENDER, ANTARCTICA IS A VERY COLD PLACE TO LIVE. BUT IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES ON EARTH. [ Squawking of seagull ] [ ??? ] AND IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAS BOTH TESTICLES AND A VAGINA, YOU MAY NOT WANT TO GO TO ANTARCTICA AT ALL. AMSTERDAM PROBABLY MAKES MORE SENSE FOR WHAT YOU ARE: HALF-MAN, HALF-WOMAN. AND ANALOGOUS TO BEING A HALF-MAN, HALF-WOMAN, ANTARCTICA USED TO BE POPULATED BY THICK BUSHES, UNTIL MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO, WHEN IT SLOWLY DRIFTED TO THE SOUTHMOST POINT OF THE EARTH WHERE ALL HELL FROZE OVER. AMERICA USED TO BE POPULATED BY THICK BUSHES TOO UNTIL THEY STARTED BIKINI WAXES AND BRAZILIAN CUTS. HMMM-HMMM... I MISS BIG BUSHES. ANTARCTICA IS ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TIMES THE SIZE OF THE UNITED STATES. A CLAIM ONCE MADE IN THE 1960s, BY CUBA. BUT THIS ISN'T A STORY ABOUT A COUNTRY WHO'S JUST WAITING FOR THEIR NEXT DICTATOR TO DIE. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT THE AMAZING CREATURES WHO FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS HAVE LIVED HERE IN MOTHER EARTH'S FRIGID WHITE ANUS. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT SURVIVAL. IT IS A STORY ABOUT DETERMINATION. BUT MAINLY, IT IS A STORY ABOUT LOVE, PENGUIN LOVE. THIS IS THE... [ ??? ] [ ??? ] Both: WHOO-HOO! OHHH! WHAA! OY! Samuel L. Jackson: [ Narrating ] EVERY JANUARY, THOUSANDS OF MALE PENGUINS GO TO THE OCEAN TO FEED. IT IS NATURE'S RITUAL... Penguin: YES! GIVING THEM THE FUEL AND STRENGTH TO MAKE THE TREACHEROUS JOURNEY BACK HOME, WHERE THEY WILL THEN MATE WITH THE BITCHES THEY HAVE YET TO MEET. BUT THOSE BITCHES ARE 4 MONTHS AND 70 MILES AWAY. SO FOR NOW, THE MALES WILL BOND. BUT DUE TO BUDGETARY ISSUES, THEIR MOUTHS DO NOT MOVE, YET WE CAN HEAR THEIR EVERY NEUROTIC THOUGHT. Male: JIMMY, HAS IT EVER DAWNED ON YOU THAT WE HAVE MAJOR EATING DISORDERS? Jimmy: CARL, EVERYBODY HAS AN EATING DISORDER. Carl: YEAH, BUT NOT LIKE US. WE DON'T EAT FOR 6 MONTHS, AND THEN WE WALK 70 MILES, FILL OUR GUTS TILL WE'RE SUPER-SIZED, AND THEN WE WALK BACK 70 MILES TO GET LAID. IT'S SICK. Jimmy: CARL, WHEN WE GET TO THE WATER, TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT YOUR REFLECTION. YOU'RE A PENGUIN! YOU DON'T HAVE AN EATING DISORDER. YOU'RE A PENGUIN. WE WALK, WE EAT, WE GET LAID. Carl: I JUST WISH OUR LIVES WERE DIFFERENT. Jimmy: YOU MAKE YOUR OWN HAPPINESS, MY FRIEND. I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENTIRELY TRUE, JIMMY. Jimmy: YOU DON'T THINK YOUR OWN POSITIVE ATTITUDE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT THE RELATIONSHIPS IN YOUR LIFE ARE WORKING? Carl: IF YOU ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP. MY OWN POSITIVE ATTITUDE WASN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP VALERIE FROM LEAVING ME. REMEMBER? Valerie: I'M LEAVING YOU, CARL. WHY, VALERIE? I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING SO WELL. I WANT A BIGGER HOUSE. A BIGGER HOUSE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE LIVE OUTDOORS. YOUR HOUSE CAN'T GET ANY BIGGER. WE JUST DON'T WANT THE SAME THINGS, CARL. OBVIOUSLY. YOU WANT A BIGGER HOUSE. THAT'S NOT EVEN IN THE REALM OF REALITY. GOODBYE, CARL. [ Echoing ] Carl: AND THE YEAR BEFORE HER: AMANDA. Amanda: I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU, CARL. I CHEATED ON YOU. HOW? WE'VE BEEN STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER FOR TWO MONTHS. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, VITTORIO CAME OVER AND... WE MADE LOVE. BUT I WAS STANDING RIGHT HERE. THAT'S WHY IT'S OVER, CARL. YOU DIDN'T EVEN WAKE UP. Jimmy: SHE HAD A POINT. Carl: AND THE YEAR BEFORE HER: ESTHER. Esther: I CAN'T BE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KEEP KOSHER. ALL I EAT IS FISH, ESTHER. WHAT HAVE I EATEN THAT'S NOT KOSHER? HAVE YOU EATEN SQUID, OR OCTOPUS, OR SHRIMP? YES, BUT I ONLY EAT ONCE A YEAR. YOU CAN'T BEGRUDGE ME. YOU MIGHT AS WELL DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART, CARL. Jimmy: YOU'VE BEEN CHOOSING THE WRONG WOMEN, BUDDY. Carl: YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE PEAK IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN EVERYTHING AFTER THAT IS DOWNHILL. WELL, YOU JUST GOTTA GET BACK TO THE OLD CARL, THE GUY I KNEW WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER, THE GUY WHO DIDN'T CARE WHO HE BANGED NIGHT TO NIGHT. OOOH! I ALWAYS CARED. OH, YEAH, BUT NOW YOU CARE TOO MUCH. SORRY, BUDDY, IF I DON'T EAT SOON, I'M GONNA PASS OUT. YOU BOYS READY TO BLOCK YOUR COLONS FOR THREE MONTHS? Male: WHERE YOU LEAD ME, I WILL GO, JIMMY. I HAVE NO DISCERNIBLE PERSONALITY. I JUST HOPE THERE'S SAND DABS DOWN THERE. LAST YEAR, SOME ASSHOLE ATE ALL THE SAND DABS. Male: GOD, I LOVE SAND DABS. THEY'RE SO GOOD... ALL SUCCULENT, PAN-FRIED WITH A LITTLE BUTTER. Jimmy: COME ON, MEN! LET'S FILL OUR GUTS WITH FISH AND THEN GET US SOME... AHHH! Male: I'M RIGHT ON YOUR TAIL, JIMMY! I'M STARVING! I'M HORNY. I'M SIDNEY! [ Cheering ] [ ??? ] Narrator: PENGUINS ARE FASCINATING CREATURES. THEY ARE BIRDS, BUT CANNOT FLY. Male: NATURE REALLY FUCKED US. CAN'T EVEN JERK OFF. Narrator: THEY LIVE IN THE OCEAN, BUT HAVE TO COME UP FOR AIR. OW! ROCKS. HURT. STOMACH. SCRATCH. ROCK. RAW! BLEEDING. SHIT. AH! WHY... AM... I... DOING THIS! [ ??? ] Narrator: IT'S A FUN, INDULGENT FEW MONTHS FOR THEM: EATING WHENEVER THEY WANT TO, NO RESPONSIBILITIES, IT'S KIND OF LIKE GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI. TO GET IN THERE, ALL YOU NEED IS A 1.8, A SIX-PACK, AND A BONG. THE MORE YOU WATCH THEM, THE MORE YOU REALIZE HOW BEAUTIFUL PENGUINS ARE. ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE... THIS. LOOK AT THE FACE ON THAT POOR THING. NOT EVEN HIS OWN MOTHER COULD LOVE THAT. [ Belching ] [ Gurgling ] Carl: THIS CAN'T BE GOOD FOR OUR INTERNAL ORGANS. Jimmy: STOP BITCHING AND START GORGING, CARL. WE ARE OFFICIALLY UNDERWAY. Carl: THAT'S IT? AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO WAIT, LIKE, 30 MINUTES BEFORE WALKING 70 MILES? YOU'RE SUCH A PUSSY. MAYBE THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU. GOD, IT WAS FREEZING DOWN THERE, JIMMY. IF I HAD TESTICLES, THEY'D BE UP INSIDE MY BODY RIGHT NOW. IF YOU HAD TESTICLES, YOU'D BE GETTING RAPED BY A SEAL. NO MEANS NO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. IT'S A NON SEQUITUR, MY FRIEND. NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO HAVE MEANING. OUR LIVES SHOULD. UGH! HERE WE GO... DON'T YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ANYTHING, JIMMY? LIKE WHY WE LIVE HERE. WE COULD MOVE TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WE WANTED TO. CARL, WHERE ARE WE GOING TO MOVE TO, AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE, BURROW? IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN GO ON THE INTERNET AND FIND A DEAL. THIS IS WHAT WE DO. WE WALK 70 MILES FOR SAND DABS. Male: GOD, I LOVE SAND DABS. THEY'RE SO GOOD. ALL SUCCULENT, PAN-FRIED WITH A LITTLE BUTTER. I DON'T KNOW. WE COULD MOVE TO LOS ANGELES. ALL WE DO IS WALK. NOBODY WALKS IN L.A. NEW YORK? YOU'D FREEZE YOUR ASS OFF IN THE WINTER. CHICAGO? TOO WINDY. PALM SPRINGS? I SEE DEAD PEOPLE. CARL, THE PROBLEM'S NOT WHERE WE LIVE, THE PROBLEM IS WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON INSIDE THAT NEUROTIC LITTLE HEAD OF YOURS. IT'S HOPELESS, JIMMY. IF I WAS EATEN BY A KILLER SEAL RIGHT NOW, NOBODY WOULD EVEN MISS ME. HEY, SHITHEAD! [ Smack ] OW! I WOULD MISS YOU, ALL OF OUR OTHER FRIENDS WOULD MISS YOU TOO. YEAH! WE'D MISS YOU, CARL. YOU GO, GIRL. Jimmy: OH, YOU GOTTA SHAKE IT OFF, BRO. IT'S TIME TO GET OUT OF YOUR SLUMP. YOU'RE GOING TO MEET SOMEBODY AGAIN. MAYBE EVEN THE ONE. Carl: YEAH, THE ONE OF FOUR WHO LEAVES ME. LISTEN, CARL, I CAN REALLY HELP YOU FIND A WOMAN THIS YEAR, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME HELP YOU. YOU CAN'T BE SO FREAKIN' NEEDY. YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, WHAT ARE YOU REALLY LOOKING FOR IN A WOMAN? Carl: I JUST WANT SOMEONE WHO GETS ME FOR WHO I AM, NOT FOR HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE, OR FOR THE CAR THAT I DRIVE, OR FOR THE CLOTHES THAT I WEAR, BUT FOR WHO I AM INSIDE. Jimmy: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Carl: IT'S A MONOLOGUE FOR MY ACTING CLASS BUT IT'S HOW I REALLY FEEL. [ Clapping ] EXCELLENT SCENE! VERY MOVING! I REALLY FELT HIS PAIN. PRECIOUS! [ ??? ] Narrator: MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE MATING GROUNDS, THE AIR IS COLDER THAN A WELL DIGGER'S ASSHOLE. AND THE FEMALE PENGUINS ARE HUDDLED TOGETHER, TRYING TO STAY WARM, WAITING FOR THE SUITORS THEY'VE NEVER MET. Female: IT'D BE NICE TO MEET A GUY THIS YEAR WHO DIDN'T JUST WANT ME FOR MY BODY. Female: THEY ONLY WANT ONE THING, HONEY. STEFAN CALLED ME FRIGID 'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A BABY WITH HIM. AW, GIRL, OUT HERE WE'RE ALL FRIGID. AND HE WAS JUST PLAYIN' YOU, TRYING TO GET YOU PUDDIN' PIE. NOW, FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING THIS, BUT STEFAN WAS AN ASSHOLE. [ Sigh ] I KNOW. WHY DO I ALWAYS FALL FOR THE ASSHOLES? OH, YOU'RE YOUNG YET, BABY. IT'S NORMAL. TRUST ME, IT'S PART OF YOUR FEMININE EDUCATION. AND THEY'RE ALWAYS THE CUTE ONES. OH, NOW WAIT A MINUTE, BITCH. NOT ALWAYS! REMEMBER WHEN I DATED RALPH? HE WAS AN ASSHOLE AND HE WAS U-GLY! WHY'D YOU GO OUT WITH HIM? WELL HE USED TO TELL ME HOW BEAUTIFUL I WAS ALL THE TIME. [ Chuckle ] Ralph: VICKY, YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I'VE EVER SEEN. Vicky: [ Sigh ] WELL, THANK YOU, RALPH. Ralph: LET'S MAKE LOVE WITH OUR EYES CLOSED. YEAH, WELL THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WITH YOU, RALPH. Female: WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM? Vicky: I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT. HE GOT SAT ON BY A WALRUS. SMASHED HIS HEAD FLAT. HE WAS NEVER THE SAME AFTERWARDS. OH, MY GOD! IT DIDN'T KILL HIM? UH-UH... NOT RIGHT AWAY. GIRL, HE DIED MONTHS LATER CHOKING ON A DAMN ANCHOVY. HIS HEAD WAS SMASHED SO FLAT, HE COULDN'T EVEN SWALLOW IT! TSK. OH, I'M SORRY, VICKY. AND I DIDN'T THINK HE COULD GET UGLIER, BUT DAMNED IF HE DIDN'T. I AM SO READY TO MEET SOMEONE NEW. UGH! I'M SO FED UP WITH THE CLUB SCENE. SO ARE BABY SEALS. I'M SERIOUS, VICKY. IT TAKES US MONTHS TO GET READY. WE COME TO A SPA LIKE THIS ONE, GET ALL DOLLED-UP, FIX OUR HAIR, GET OUR NAILS DONE, GET OUR EYEBROWS WAXED, AND WHAT AM I DOING IT ALL FOR? THE GUY I CHOOSE IS JUST GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE ANOTHER ASSHOLE. Vicky: HONEY, MY MAMA USED TO TELL ME, "THEY'RE ALL ASSHOLES, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO END UP WITH." [ ??? ] Jimmy: YOU KNOW, I'M SO FULL RIGHT NOW, IF I FARTED, A MINNOW WOULD POP OUT OF MY ASS. Carl: DON'T TRY TO GROSS ME OUT, JIMMY. Jimmy: I'D PROBABLY EAT IT TOO. Carl: JIMMY, STOP IT OR I'LL THROW UP. Jimmy: I'D PROBABLY EAT THAT TOO. Carl: SHUT UP, WILL YOU! Jimmy: SERIOUSLY, CARL, I'LL EAT ANYTHING. I'M LIKE A NANNY GOAT. THAT WAS A GOOD PIECE OF SALMON YESTERDAY, WASN'T IT? WHY IS IT ALL WE TALK ABOUT IS THE LAST MEAL WE ATE? WE TALK ABOUT BREAKFAST DURING LUNCH, LUNCH DURING DINNER, AND DINNER DURING BREAKFAST. Jimmy: THAT IS WHAT WE DO, MY FRIEND. IT'S OUR HERITAGE. Jimmy: OUR PARENTS DID IT, THEIR PARENTS DID IT, ALL MY BASTARD CHILDREN ARE GOING TO DO IT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? OUR GREAT- GREAT-GRANDFATHERS STOOD ON THIS VERY SPOT 100 YEARS AGO, AND HAD THIS EXACT SAME CONVERSATION. Jimmy's grandfather: THAT WAS A GOOD PIECE OF SALMON YESTERDAY, WASN'T IT? Carl's grandfather: WHY IS IT ALL WE TALK ABOUT IS THE LAST MEAL WE ATE? [ Hacking/coughing ] YOU OKAY? YEAH, EXCUSE ME. I HAD A BONE STUCK IN MY THROAT. Carl: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. WE'RE NOT EVOLVING. THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO LIFE THAN FOOD. WE DON'T EAT TO LIVE, WE LIVE TO EAT. Jimmy: WE ALSO LIVE FOR SEX. Male: DID SOMEONE SAY "SEX"? I JUST SHOW UP ON CUE WHEN I HEAR THAT. Jimmy: UH, HEY, SIDNEY. HEY, GUYS. IT'S EXCITING, ISN'T IT? WE'RE ON OUR WAY, AT THE START OF OUR JOURNEY TO GET OURSELVES SOME PUSSY. Carl: SIDNEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING? Sidney: OF COURSE, CARL. WE'RE BROS. Carl: WELL FORGIVE ME FOR ASKING YOU THIS... I'VE, UH, I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR HOW LONG NOW? Sidney: LIKE, FOUR YEARS. RIGHT. WELL, THE PAST FEW MATING SEASONS, I... I DIDN'T SEE YOU, UH...

I AM SO ALL ABOUT THE PUSSY! WELL, YOU CERTAINLY CLEARED UP THE RUMOURS. WELL, YOU TELL THOSE BOYS TO STOP RUMOURING. I'M GOING FOR A JOG, WORK OFF SOME OF THIS DINNER. UGH! I'M SO BLOATED. ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU BOYS IN A FEW! GAY! [ Laughing ] THAT IS SO FUNNY! GAY! [ Laughing ] Jimmy: YOU KNOW, YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM SIDNEY. HE ACCEPTS WHO HE IS. HE DOES? APPARENTLY SO. AND YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE GOING THROUGH A MAJOR MID-LIFE CRISIS, MY FRIEND. AND IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS. OH, HI, STEVE. [ ??? ] HELLO, JIMMY. HELLO, CARL. Carl: OH, HELLO, STEVE. AND HOW... HOW ARE WE FEELING TODAY? Carl: NOT SO GOOD, STEVE. WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE BREEDING GROUNDS AND I CAN'T STOP OBSESSING OVER ALL THE NEGATIVES OF MY LIFE, ESPECIALLY MY WRONG CHOICES IN WOMEN. MM-HMM. CARL, WE... WE HAVE THE SAME DISCUSSION EVERY SEASON. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN A PARTNER? Jimmy: THAT'S WHAT I ASKED HIM! I'M TALKING TO CARL, JIMMY. WHAT IS IT YOU WANT, CARL? UH, I DON'T KNOW. TO HAVE A WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS ME. OH, THAT'S GOOD. AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THINK WOULD HELP A WOMAN UNDERSTAND YOU? UM... IF MAYBE I UNDERSTOOD HER? MM-HMM. AND IT WOULD HELP, I GUESS, IF I WASN'T SO... NEEDY. I'VE TOLD HIM THAT TOO! AND YOU ALSO KEEP TELLING ME I NEED TO GET LAID ALL THE TIME. AND HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL, CARL? PRESSURED. MAYBE JIMMY'S JUST TRYING TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR RUT. Jimmy: EXACTLY! THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO, BRO. I THINK WE'VE MADE PROGRESS TODAY. NOW... NOW GO WITH JIMMY AND THE OTHERS, AND YOU HAVE A LONG JOURNEY AHEAD OF YOU. I'LL JUST BILL YOUR INSURANCE. OKAY. THANKS, STEVE. BE GOOD TO YOURSELF, AND REMEMBER: WHEN ALL LOOKS LOST, YOU NEED TO HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESCRIPTION WITH YOU. Carl: ALL RIGHT. REMEMBER, BOYS, WISDOM COMES FROM SUFFERING. Carl: WHO SAID THAT? Steve: MY MOTHER! Narrator: THREE MONTHS HAVE GONE BY, AND NOW IT IS MARCH. AND THAT IS JUST WHAT THESE LITTLE MASOCHISTS ARE GOING TO DO: MARCH, 70 MILES BACK HOME, TO WHERE THE WOMEN ARE, TO WHERE THE ICE IS THICKER, WHICH MAKES IT SAFER FOR THEM TO MATE AND GIVE BIRTH BEFORE THE APPROACHING POLAR WINTER FREEZES THEIR LITTLE BUTTHOLES COMPLETELY SHUT.

[ Whistling ] [ ??? ] Jimmy: YOU'VE GOT TO COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, CARL. NOT MANY ANIMALS CAN DO 20 HOURS OF CARDIO A DAY. Carl: WE'RE SO ATHLETIC, AND WE CAN'T EVEN SCRATCH OUR OWN ASSES. Jimmy: AMERICA'S FAVOURITE PASTIME. WALRUSES CAN. CAN WHAT? SCRATCH THEIR OWN ASSES. NO THEY CAN'T, THEIR ARMS ARE SHORTER THAN OURS. I'VE SEEN THEM DO IT, AND IT'S NOT PRETTY. I'VE GOT AN ITCHY ASS. MY ASS IS SO ITCHY. SCRATCHING MY ASS. SCRATCHING MY ASS TOO. OH, THE HUMANITY! Jimmy: I STAND CORRECTED. YOU STARTING TO FEEL ANY BETTER, CARL? YEAH, A LITTLE. THANKS. MAYBE THAT GIRL, DEBBIE, WILL BE THERE THIS YEAR. Jimmy: OH, YEAH, DEBBIE. END OF LAST SEASON. WHY DIDN'T YOU CLOSE THAT? Carl: SHE WOULDN'T RETURN MY CALLS. HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU CALL HER? I DON'T KNOW, I JUST KEPT CALLING HER. DEBBIE! DEBBIE! Debbie: OH, SHIT. DEBBIE! DEBBIE? Carl: MUST HAVE CALLED HER TEN TIMES. Jimmy: YOU CALLED HER TEN TIMES? YEAH. BRO, THAT'S STALKING. Jimmy: YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP CALLING A GIRL. YOU CALL HER ONCE, IF SHE DOESN'T RESPOND, THAT'S IT. I SHOULD HAVE DISGUISED MY VOICE. [ Changing voice ] HELLO, DEBBIE, THIS IS NOT CARL.

WE'LL JUST CONTINUE ON OUR LITTLE JOURNEY THEN. Narrator: THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, JIMBO. [ ??? ] HEY, GUYS. IT'S US. WAIT UP! Narrator: THE HOPE IS THAT AFTER THIS DETOUR, THEY'D BE ABLE TO FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THE OTHERS. BUT IT'S TOO LATE FOR SOME. THE TREACHEROUS JOURNEY HAS ALREADY AFFECTED THEIR MINDS. Male: I DON'T NEED THE REST OF THOSE FUCKERS. I HAVE FOUND GOOD ANTARCTIC SKUNK WEED. AND THAT SKUNK WEED WILL HELP ME FIND THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE. IT IS I, AND I ALONE, JUAN SANCHEZ, WHO WILL MAKE THIS DISCOVERY. AND THEN, I WILL BE FAMOUS! SURE, THEY'LL BE AT HOME, HAVING SEX WITH ALL THE WOMEN, BUT I DON'T NEED NO STINKIN' WOMEN.

YEAH, IT'S BETTER IF IT SUDDENLY GETS WARMER AND ALL THE ICE MELTS AND WE GOT NO PLACE TO STAND 'CAUSE THE FUCKING GROUND BENEATH US TURNED TO FUCKING WATER. DON'T YELL. YOU COULD START AN AVALANCHE. WITH WHAT? THERE'S NO FUCKING SNOW! [ Echoing ] SNOW... SNOW... Sidney: WHAT WAS THAT? Jimmy: YOU FART AGAIN? Carl: NO. MAYBE IT WAS YOU. I DON'T FART, THAT'S NOT HOW I ROLL. I EITHER HOLD IT IN OR I JUST TAKE A CRAP RIGHT THERE. YOU SHOULD WRITE ROMANCE NOVELS. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? YOU'RE NOT PROUD TO BE A PENGUIN. "PROUD TO BE A PENGUIN." WHY ARE WE EVEN CALLED PENGUINS? WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN? IT'S A GREAT NAME FOR US. IT'S NOT SO ON-THE-NOSE. WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER BE? A RAM? YOU KNOW WHY THEY'RE CALLED RAMS? RAM! RAM! AT LEAST THEY'RE MORE MOBILE THAN US. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING. I'D RATHER BE A SEA LION THAN A PENGUIN. YOU KNOW HOW MANY SEA LIONS DIE YOUNG FROM TOO MUCH SMOKING AND DRINKING? SEA LIONS DON'T SMOKE. THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT GUY WE SAW AT THE BEACH WITH SMOKER'S COUGH? [ Wheezing cough ] OH, YEAH. AND THEN HE DRANK TOO MUCH AND GOT SICK, REMEMBER? I SHOULDN'T HAVE MIXED ALL OF THOSE SHOTS OF BOOZE. [ Retching ] TRUST ME. WE'RE NOT MISSING OUT ON ANYTHING. WE AGE BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY ANIMAL ON THE PLANET. YOU EVER SEE A TURTLE WHEN HE GETS SO OLD HE HAS TO USE A WALKER? IT'S NOT PRETTY, MY FRIEND. [ Groaning ] YOU'RE RIGHT, JIMMY. I HAVEN'T BEEN APPRECIATIVE ENOUGH. NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT. Narrator: AND SO THE JOURNEY CONTINUES. Jimmy: ? I'M NOT SURE BUT THIS I KNOW ? All: ? HE'S NOT SURE BUT THIS HE KNOWS ? ? PENGUIN PUSSY'S MIGHTY COLD ? ? PENGUIN PUSSY'S MIGHTY COLD ? Carl: ? A CLASSY PENGUIN JIMMY'S NOT ? ? A CLASSY PENGUIN JIMMY'S NOT ? Jimmy: ? CARL'S RIGHT ? ? 'CAUSE PENGUIN PUSSY'S MIGHTY HOT ? ? 'CAUSE PENGUIN PUSSY'S MIGHTY HOT ? Jimmy: ? SHOUT OUT ? ? FUCK YOU ? [ ??? ] Narrator: THE SUN IS SETTING EARLIER NOW. THE WEATHER IS GETTING COLDER. AND I CAN'T WAIT TO FINISH RECORDING THIS SHIT AND GO PLAY GOLF. THE MALES STOP MIDWAY THROUGH THEIR JOURNEY TO REST AND RECUPERATE. Old Male: WHERE'S THAT CABANA BOY? I NEED NEW TOWELS! Old male: STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME. I'VE GOT AN ITCH. Narrator: SOMETIMES THE ELEMENTS GET THE BEST OF THEM. THE OLDER PENGUINS KNOW THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY CALL OUT... Old Male: I'M FREEZING MY NUTS OFF! Narrator: DAMN. THE COLD IS MAKING EVERYBODY CRANKIER. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH. YOU'RE IN A WARM RECORDING STUDIO IN L.A. GETTING PAID TONNES OF MONEY. Narrator: NOT ENOUGH. I'M SURE IT'S A RESPECTABLE AMOUNT. Narrator: NOT ENOUGH. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT 'CAUSE I'M FREEZING MY NUTS OFF! Narrator: STOP COMPLAINING. IT'S WHERE YOU CHOSE TO LIVE. CHOSE? ARE YOU AN IDIOT? WHY WOULD I CHOOSE TO LIVE IN 80-BELOW WEATHER? Narrator: MAY I CONTINUE? HOW CAN I STOP YOU? YOU'RE IN SUNNY CALIFORNIA AND I'M IN ANTARCTICA, FREEZING MY NUTS OFF! Narrator: MAY I CONTINUE? OOOWWW! Narrator: WHAT'S WRONG? I TOLD YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH, AND YOU JUST KEPT TALKING, AND I... FROZE MY NUTS OFF! Narrator: THOSE AREN'T YOUR NUTS. YES THEY ARE. Narrator: YOU DON'T HAVE NUTS, JUST SOME KIND OF FLIPPER THING YOU USE AS A PENIS. YOU KNOW WHAT? FUCK YOU! MORGAN FREEMAN HAS MORE TALENT THAN YOU IN JUST A FRECKLE ON HIS ASS. Narrator: THANK YOU! ENJOY THE POLAR WINTER. IT'S JUST STARTING. SHOULDN'T BE SO ROUGH FOR YOU. YOU'RE VERY OLD, AND YOU'VE ALREADY FROZEN YOUR NUTS OFF, OR WHATEVER THOSE THINGS WERE, SINCE PENGUINS DON'T HAVE NUTS. FU-U-UCK YOU-U-U! Narrator [ Yelling ]: NO, FUCK YOU, YOU OLD NUTLESS MOTHERFUCK... [ Clearing throat ] MY BAD. IT IS SHEER INSTINCT THAT LEADS THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE MEANT TO GO. THE ROUTE IS NEVER THE SAME. Jimmy: SEE, CARL? IT IS SHEER INSTINCT WHERE WE ARE MEANT TO GO. Carl: IT'S TRUE. THE ROUTE IS NEVER THE SAME. Old Male: I'M FREEZING MY NUTS OFF! Carl: WHAT WAS THAT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHOEVER IT IS, YOU CAN BE SURE OF ONE THING: THEY'RE FREEZING THEIR NUTS OFF. Males: [ Speaking in French ] [ Farting ] Old Male: I CAN'T SEE SHIT! Narrator: THE DAYS BECOME HARSHER, THE AIR GROWS COLDER. AND WHAT HAS BECOME OF THOSE LOST PENGUIN MOTHERFUCKERS WHO STRAYED FROM THEIR BRETHREN? [ Guitar ??? ] ? I AM JUAN SANCHEZ ? ? AND I CLIMB TO THE TOP ? ? 'CAUSE I'VE GONE FUCKING NUTS ? ? AND MY JOURNEY WILL NOT STOP ? ? I'M A FREAK OF A BIRD ? ? I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF MY BREED ? ? AND I DON'T EVEN CARE ? ? 'CAUSE I SMOKED SO MUCH SKUNK WEED ? ? AND WHEN I GET TO THE TOP ? ? I WILL JUMP OFF THE EDGE ? ? AND MY JOURNEY WILL STOP ? ? AND I'LL NEVER HAVE SEX ? ? AND I NEVER WILL SHAVE ? ? AND I'LL NEVER GET TO BE ? ? SOME SHORT BITCH'S WHORE ? ? THAT IS ME ? ? JUAN SANCHEZ IS MY NAME ? Male: I TOLD YOU NOT TO YELL. A WHOLE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN CAME DOWN. Male: YEAH, LIKE, IT'S MY FAULT THE EARTH IS MELTING. JUST AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, ISN'T IT? SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TELL OUR GOVERNMENT TO SHOVE SOME FREEZER COILS INTO THE FUCKING ENDS OF THE EARTH BEFORE THE WHOLE FUCKING PLANET TURNS INTO FUCKING JELLO! Narrator: AND SO, THE HARSHNESS OF NATURE TAKES A TOLL. THE DAYS TURN INTO NIGHTS. AND THE NIGHTS TURN INTO DAYS. AND THE DAYS TURN INTO NIGHTS. AND THEN THE NIGHTS TURN INTO DAYS. AND THEN THE DAYS TURN INTO NIGHTS. AND THEN THE NIGHTS TURN INTO DAYS. AND THEN... SAY IT WITH ME NOW! [ ??? ] Jimmy: FINALLY, A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, RIGHT? NOW WE CAN MOVE ON. Carl: I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT HAVING A NIGHTMARE. Jimmy: ABOUT WHAT? Carl: [ Sigh ] WELL... I'M NOT HERE. I MEAN, I'M NOT IN ANTARCTICA. I'M A PRISONER. I DON'T KNOW WHERE, BUT... I'M IN SOME KIND OF ENCLOSURE. AND I'M TRAPPED AND PEOPLE ARE RIDICULING ME. Girl: LOOK AT THE SHORT, STUPID-LOOKING PENGUIN, DADDY. Man: HE'S A FUNNY- LOOKING BASTARD, AIN'T HE, SWEETHEART? Carl: IT WAS HELL ON EARTH. Jimmy: WOW. LUCKY FOR US THAT KIND OF PLACE DOESN'T EXIST. YOU'RE JUST SLEEP-DEPRIVED. COME ON, CARL. LET'S GET TO THE SEX. JIMMY, I THINK YOU HAVE A SEXUAL OBSESSION. NO I DON'T. YOU KNOW WHO HAS A SEXUAL OBSESSION? Jimmy: A MONKEY. A MONKEY'LL BANG ANYTHING. AT FIRST, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE JUST PLAYING, RIGHT? LIKE THIS GUY WHO JUST WANTED TO GET SOME MILK OUT OF A COCONUT. HE WANTED TO CRACK A HOLE IN IT BUT NOT JUST TO GET THE MILK OUT. Carl: THAT'S NUTS. Jimmy: YEAH. COCO-NUTS. Jimmy: NEVER SAW THAT ON "SURVIVOR ISLAND", DID YOU, BRO? KEEP MOVING, HOMIE. WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU A WOMAN. Sidney: ? AND WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH YOU ? ? WE'RE GONNA GET ME ONE OF THOSE ? ? TOO ? ? I'M SIDNEY ? [ ??? ] Narrator: BACK AT THE MATING GROUNDS, THE FEMALES CAN SENSE THEIR MEN ARE NEARING THE END OF THEIR JOURNEY. THEY WAIT WITH SELFLESS ANTICIPATION. [ Club ??? ] Helen: IF A GUY EVEN LOOKS AT ME THE WRONG WAY, I'M GOING TO PECK HIS EYES OUT. Vicky: WELL, THEY'LL BE LINING UP FOR YOU, HELEN. AND AS SOON AS THEY SEE YOU, WHOO, THEY'LL THANK THE LORD YOU PECKED THEIR EYES OUT. Helen: WE'LL SEE WHO FINDS A MAN, AND WHO DOESN'T, BITCH. Melissa: HAS SHE EVER HELD ON TO A MAN? Vicky: ONLY BY THE THROAT. WELL, SHE HAD A HUSBAND ONCE. WHAT HAPPENED? SHE PECKED HIS EYES OUT. THAT BITCH WASN'T KIDDING. Female 1: THIS PARTY IS GOING TO BE SO HOT. Female 2: I HEARD THE AFTER- PARTY IS HOTTER. [ Giggling ] THERE'S AN AFTER- PARTY AFTER THAT, THAT I HEAR IS WAY HOTTER THAN THE PARTY OR THE AFTER-PARTY. YEAH, BUT THEN I HEARD THERE'S A V.I.P AFTER-PARTY FOR THE AFTER- PARTY'S V.I.P.s AFTER THE OTHER AFTER-PARTIES. [ Mixed giggling ] Melissa: WHO ARE THEY? Vicky: OH, THAT'S THE HILTON PENGUINS. THEY'RE SWEET GIRLS, BUT YOU KNOW, THEY ALL ABOUT THE PARTY. SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE REAL, MELISSA. I THINK I AM. Helen: WHO'S BEEN USING MY SANITARY NAPKINS? [ ??? ] Sidney: JIMMY, CAN WE PLAY IT ONE MORE TIME? Jimmy: ALL RIGHT. ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS. Carl: WHY DO YOU GUYS KEEP PLAYING THIS? WE HAVE NO HANDS! WITH US, IT'S PAPER, PAPER, PAPER.

Jimmy: NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S HIM. Carl: I THINK IT IS HIM. THIS IS ALL MY FAULT, JIMMY. IF I HADN'T EATEN THOSE ANCHOVIES, I WOULDN'T HAVE FARTED IN HIS FACE AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE AHEAD WITHOUT US. I'M TELLING YOU... OW! IT'S NOT MARCUS. OW! OW! OW! STOP IT, JIMMY! NOW CHILL THE FUCK OUT! Marcus: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TWO MOTHERFUCKERS FREAKIN' ABOUT? Jimmy & Carl: MARCUS! Marcus: YES, THAT WOULD BE ME. WHO THE FUCK IS THAT? Carl: UH, I DON'T KNOW.

Jimmy: THAT WAS FUNNY WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT TRIPPING OVER YOUR OWN DICK. Marcus: OH, THAT WASN'T A JOKE. I AM TRULY BLESSED. I'M NOT ONE TO BRAG, BUT MY DICK'S NOT AS SHY AS I AM. I DON'T SHOW THIS TO EVERYBODY, BUT SINCE YOU'RE ALL SO GLAD TO SEE ME AND ALL, FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS: [ Unzipping of pants ] [ Thud ] I AM THE FIRST PENGUIN IN HISTORY WHO CAN TOUCH HIS TOES... WITH HIS DICK. Carl: THAT'S, UH... THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. I'M SURE WOMEN FIND IT ADORABLE. Marcus: YOUR WOMAN LAST YEAR DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND IT. AW, COME ON! I'M JUST FUCKIN' WITH YOU AGAIN. AND IF I HAD TAKEN A SHOT AT YOUR LADIES FROM LAST YEAR, THEY DEFINITELY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WALK THIS YEAR, ESPECIALLY AFTER BEING RAVAGED BY MY... GIGANTIC PENGUIN COCK! Carl: I BELIEVE THAT'S AN OXYMORON. Marcus: WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S BROUGHT HAPPINESS TO THE FACES OF MILLIONS. AND IT'S KEPT THE TOPS OF MY TOES WARM THROUGH MANY A LONELY WINTER. WELL, GOOD TO SEE YOU, BOYS. YOU TOO. YOU TOO. SEE YOU ON THE INSIDE, GENTLEMEN. AND I DO MEAN "ON THE INSIDE". OOOW! CAN YOU FEEL ME? [ Rap ??? ] 'CAUSE I FEEL YOU. [ ??? ] Jimmy: UH-OH. Carl: WHAT NOW? YOU BOYS ARE GOING THE WRONG WAY. Carl: NO, I... I BELIEVE THE, UH... BREEDING GROUNDS ARE STRAIGHT AHEAD. THE ROAD'S CLOSED. DOESN'T LOOK CLOSED. HE SAYS THE ROAD DON'T LOOK CLOSED, MUMFORD. SO HE DOES. LOOK OVER THERE, CITY SLICKER. THAT WASN'T THERE A SECOND AGO. I SUGGEST YOU TAKE THE DETOUR, UNLESS YOU WANT US TO EAT YOU ALL. Carl: YOU CAN'T JUST EAT US ALL. Jimmy: OH YES THEY CAN, CARL. THEY CAN EAT US ALL. IT'S DEFINITELY DO-ABLE. Carl: YOU'RE NOT GOOD GUYS. OOOH, THAT STINGS. IF I WASN'T AN EVIL PREDATOR, I'D BE HURT. NOW GET OFF OUR LAND, GREENHORNS. Carl: THIS ISN'T FAIR. Jimmy: LIFE ISN'T FAIR SOMETIMES. I HOPE THIS DOESN'T TAKE US TOO FAR OFF THE PATH. [ Surfing ??? ] All: [ Grunting ] WHOOOAH! AHH-HUH! OH ME! All: HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT! AHHH! GAAA! WA-AH! SEALS! FUCK! [ ??? ] Narrator: THE MEN HAVE TRAVELLED 70 MILES TO REACH THIS MOMENT: THE ENTRANCE TO THE MATING GROUNDS. Carl: YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'D HAVE BEEN EASIER GETTING EATEN BY THAT GANG OF SEALS. Jimmy: IT'S OVER, WE MADE IT. STOP BITCHING. COME ON, BOYS! LET'S MAKE OUR GRAND ENTRANCE. PSSST! HEY! WHAT? ANY OF YOU GUYS WANT TO BUY SOME TICKETS? I'VE GOT FRONT-ROW CENTRE. Carl: TICKETS FOR WHAT? THERE'S NO COVER TO THIS THING. HOW ABOUT A WATCH? YOU WANT TO BUY A WATCH? Carl: WE DON'T HAVE WRISTS. TEQUILA SHOTS, SMOKE, FLAKE, "PENGUINS GONE WILD" DVDs? THEY'RE REAL COLLEGE GIRLS DOING THINGS THEIR DADS WOULD NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT. HA-HA. Carl: GO AWAY. OKAY. Jimmy: YOU KNOW, CARL, I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO GET YOUR POWER BACK. EXCUSE ME. I CAN'T LET YOU PASS. Carl: WHO ARE YOU? I AM A WALRUS. [ Hacking cough ] Carl: SIR, WE JUST WALKED 70 MILES TO GET HERE. WE CAN'T TURN BACK NOW. DO YOU KNOW THE PASSWORD? NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A PASSWORD. DO YOU KNOW "THE DA VINCI CODE"? Jimmy: I READ THE FIRST 30 AND COULDN'T GET INTO IT. THAT'S THE PASSWORD! GO RIGHT ON THROUGH. Carl: JIMMY, HOW'D YOU READ A COPY OF "THE DA VINCI CODE"? Jimmy: I DIDN'T. BOOKS ON TAPE. [ Mixed chatter ] [ ??? ] Narrator: ALL OF THESE PENGUINS HAVE CONVERGED UPON THE SAME SPOT WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THE LARGE ICE WALLS PROTECT THEM FROM THE COLD, HIGH WINDS, AND THE THICK ICE BENEATH THEIR FEET KEEP THEIR NEWBORNS FROM BEING SUCKED INTO THE ICY WATERS BELOW. EVERYTHING HAS BUILT UP TO THIS. Jimmy: HELLO, LADIES! Melissa: OH GOD, HERE THEY COME. Vicky: HOW DO I LOOK? YOU LOOK HOT. I DO? OH, THANKS, BABY. OH, NOW... HE'S CUTE. Male: OW! Melissa: NAH, TOO SHORT. Vicky: HOW ABOUT THAT ONE?

WE TOLD HELEN WE'D MEET AT THE BAR, REMEMBER? WE DID? YES. WELL, IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU GUYS. MAYBE WE'LL, UH... SEE YOU LATER. Carl: OKAY. Melissa: BYE. Carl: BYE. Vicky: [ Chuckling ] YOU THINK THAT GUY LIKES YOU? GOD, I THOUGHT HE WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACK. Jimmy: I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE COCK-BLOCK THEMSELVES QUICKER THAN WHAT I JUST WITNESSED. SHE'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL I'VE EVER SEEN. AND SHE'S GONE... TO BE WITH ANYONE BUT YOU, BECAUSE YOU JUST ACTED LIKE A GROUPIE ON ACID. BUT I THINK I CAN STILL SALVAGE THIS. YOU DO? CARL, I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND. YOU WERE DEPRESSED FOR 70 MILES, AND YET HERE YOU ARE, WITH A CRUSH ON THE FIRST GIRL YOU MEET? IT'S A MIRACLE. I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A CRUSH. I THINK I'VE ALREADY FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER. YOU TOLD ME, WHEN I FIND HER I'LL KNOW. WELL, I KNOW, JIMMY. IT'S LOVE. LOVE? Narrator: YES, JIMMY. LOVE. IN FACT, THE WHOLE REASON THE PENGUINS MAKE THIS JOURNEY IS FOR LOVE. YES, PERHAPS THE LOVE OF THE MATING RITUAL ITSELF, BUT THAT IS SOMEHOW INTRINSIC TO EVERY SPECIES. Panda: EXCEPT MAYBE VERY RELIGIOUS ONES, STRICTER CULTURES WITH THE ABILITY TO REASON LIKE SOME HUMANS, ONLY SEE SEX AS A MEANS TO PROCREATION. Narrator: WHO ARE YOU? I AM SHEILA. I'VE HAD FIVE HUSBANDS AND FOUR CHILDREN. ONE OF MY HUSBANDS FIRED BLANKS. Narrator: SORRY. IT'S OKAY. IT HAPPENS. SO I THINK YOU RAISED AN INTERESTING POINT WITH YOUR THEORY OF ANIMAL LOVE. I WAS IN LOVE TWICE. IN LOVE WITH TWO OF MY FIVE... Narrator: THAT'S NICE TO HEAR. BUT NONE OF THEM MADE ME CUM LIKE MY HERBIE. Narrator: THANK YOU, SHEILA. NO, WAIT! THIS IS MY MOMENT! TELL ALL THOSE DIRTY LITTLE BASTARDS SITTING IN THE THEATRE ALL WATCHING THIS ON A BOOTLEG DVD WHAT LIFE'S ABOUT! Narrator: WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO OUR STORY. I'LL GIVE YA A FUCKING STORY! I'VE GOT MORE LINES AROUND MY UTERUS THAN YOU HAVE ON YOUR RESUME. Narrator: IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO SAY GOODBYE, SHEILA. THE MATING RITUAL IS ABOUT TO BEGIN. WAIT! Narrator: I AM SO SORRY YOU HAD TO SEE THAT. SORRY YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS TOO. Male: KEEP DOING IT, BABY. DADDY LIKES THAT. MMM! NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY GIRL! Male: YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN WITH TWO LADIES BEFORE. YOU TWO LIKE A LITTLE PIECE OF THIS ACTION? Female: NO, THANKS. HE IS KIND OF CUTE THOUGH, ISN'T HE? Male: HEY, I'M JUST FINE WITH THE ONE OF YA. Female: EW! HE'S SO GROSS AND SO OLD. I THINK I NEED A Z-PACK. Male: YEAH, THEY'RE ALL BITCHES. Male: I LOVE THE ICE SCULPTURE BY THE BAR. [ ??? ] Male: HEY, I'M BRAGGING I PROMOTED THIS WHOLE THING. THIS PARTY'S REALLY GOING OFF. Male: COME ON! WHO WANTS TO FUCK THE SENSITIVE GUY? Marcus: WELL, HELL-LO! Carl: HEY, MARCUS. WHAT'S UP? Marcus: NOW THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! Jimmy: IT'S LIKE HEDONISM AND SPRING-FLING HAD A KID! Carl: IT REMINDS ME OF THE SEX SCENES IN "EYES WIDE SHUT". YOU GUYS SEE THAT MOVIE? Marcus: FUCK THIS SHIT. I DIDN'T COME HERE JUST TO WATCH. EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN. [ ??? ] WELL, HELL-LO! Vicky: WELL, HELL-LO! I'M MARCUS. I'M VICKY. Marcus: AND YOU ARE? Melissa: LEAVING. Vicky: STAYING. Marcus: OOH, HOLLA. Vicky: NOW, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND, MARCUS? I'M PROUD TO SHOW YOU, VICKY. OBJECTS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. [ Unzipping ] [ Thud ] THAT? YEAH. YEAH, THAT... THAT'S GONNA HURT. IT DIDN'T HURT MY WOMAN LAST YEAR. MAY SHE REST IN PEACE. OH! NAW, I'M JUST FUCKIN' WITH YOU. Vicky: [ Chuckling ] YOU'RE FUNNY. Jimmy: HOLY SHIT. THAT MARCUS IS GOOD. Carl: YEAH. AND HE'S GOT SUBTLE FOREPLAY SKILLS. Vicky: YES, MAR! OH! YES, INDEED! YOU BETTER WORK IT, BOY! YOU'RE SO BOSSY. OH, MARCUS! OOH. STAND ON ME! MM-MM. YES, MARCUS. LOOK AT THAT TECHNIQUE. I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE TOLERATES THAT THING. LET'S MAKE SOME EGGS TOGETHER, GIRL. THEY CERTAINLY HIT IT OFF. POOR GIRL'S GOING TO BE WALKING TO THE LEFT THE REST OF HER LIFE. JIMMY, YOU SEE WHERE MELISSA WENT? Jimmy: LET'S GO FIND HER, BRO. I GOT A PLAN. [ ??? ] Narrator: WHEN CHEMISTRY HAPPENS, THERE'S NO FIGHTING IT. THE ONES WHO ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER SOMEHOW GET TO HOOK UP. Male: AH, SURE IS NICE TO MEET A GIRL IN PERSON. I MEAN, I... I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW. I USUALLY JUST MEET PEOPLE ONLINE. Female: WHAT'S "ONLINE"? Male: IT'S, UH, WHERE A BUNCH OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE AFRAID TO EVER MEET FACE-TO-FACE STAY UP ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT CHATTING WITH PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW 'CAUSE IT FEELS SAFER THAN ACTUALLY HAVING TO TALK TO THEM IN... IN PERSON. I'M LATE FOR MY FRIENDS. NICE TALKING TO YOU. MMM. IS IT 'CAUSE MY BREATH SMELLS LIKE ASS? Male: UH, HI? HI. HI THERE. UH, I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK I'M DISGUSTING BUT, WELL, WE HAVE TO MATE WITH SOMEONE AND... AND I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU'D WANT TO HOOK UP FOR THIS SEASON AND HAVE MY BABY. Female: OH YEAH, YOU'RE PERFECT FOR ME. Male: I AM? I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN INSECURE ASEXUAL GUY WHOSE LOW SELF-ESTEEM FAR OUTWEIGHS THE COMPLETE LACK OF SEXUAL ATTRACTION I HAVE FOR HIM. SWEET! Male: HEY, CAN I JOIN ONE OF YOUR TWOSOMES THERE? NO. NO. AH. DO YOU MIND IF I JUST STAND HERE AND... URINATE ALL OVER THE FOUR OF YOU? Male: OH, KEEP DOING IT, BABY. DO IT FOR DADDY. [ Whistling of wind ] Narrator: THE FEMALES ARE TRULY STARVING. AS SOON AS THE MATING RITUAL IS OVER THEY GET TO MAKE THE SAME LONG JOURNEY AS THE MALES DID, TO THE OCEAN WHERE THEY WILL FINALLY GET TO FEED. BUT FOR NOW, IT IS TIME TO MATE. Male: HI. HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? [ ??? ] MELISSA. MY NAME'S JAMIE. AND I DON'T PLAY GAMES. I LIKE TO BE HONEST AND UP FRONT. DO YOU WANT TO DO IT? Melissa: THAT IS SO GROSS. OOH, YOU'RE HONEST AND UP FRONT TOO. OOH, I LIKE THAT. Melissa: YOU'RE DISGUSTING. EXCUSE ME. HEY, WHERE YOU GOING? HI. MY NAME'S JAMIE AND I DON'T PLAY GAMES. I LIKE TO BE HONEST AND UP FRONT. [ ??? ] Carl: I DON'T SEE MELISSA ANYWHERE. Jimmy: WE'LL FIND HER. 10,000 PENGUINS HERE AND THEY'RE ALL A BUNCH OF SICKOS. Male: SAY MY NAME. SAY MY NAME, BITCH. LOOK ME IN THE EYE. WHO'S YOUR DADDY?

THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK REAL. Male: ALL THAT TIME AT SEA I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS MOMENT. Female: I'M NOT IN THE MOOD. YOUR SISTER WAS IN THE MOOD. I'M GONNA GO SEE HER. Carl: WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ROMANCE? WHATEVER HAPPENED TO DINNER AND A MOVIE? Jimmy: EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IS HAVING SEX BUT US. THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION. Jimmy: NO, IT ISN'T. LOOK. ?

YOUR FRIEND VICKY WENT OFF WITH OUR FRIEND MARCUS. Melissa: YES, SHE DID. Jimmy: UH, LOOK, MY FRIEND CARL OVER THERE... HE MAY HAVE COME OFF LIKE A COMPLETE IDIOT BEFORE, BUT IT'S... IT'S 'CAUSE, WELL, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU. Melissa: WELL, TELL HIM THAT I UNDERSTAND. AND I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIS FEELINGS OR ANYTHING BUT I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING FOR A PARTNER RIGHT NOW. Jimmy: OH. OKAY. I'LL RELAY THE MESSAGE. WILL YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE? Melissa: UH... OKAY. [ ??? ] [ Panting ] SHE SAYS SHE UNDERSTANDS AND DOESN'T WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS BUT SHE'S NOT REALLY LOOKING FOR A PARTNER RIGHT NOW. Carl: OH, GOD. WELL... OKAY.

THEY WILL STAY WITH THAT MATE ALMOST A YEAR, AS THEIR ANCESTORS DID BEFORE THEM. BUT FOR NOW, THEY WILL PLAY A WAITING GAME IN HOPES THAT THEIR COMMUNION CAN CREATE... THE EGG. BUT NOT ALL OF THEM WILL FIND A PARTNER. Jimmy: I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE COME UP DRY THIS YEAR. I'VE GOT TO SINK MY BATTLESHIP OR MY STORED-UP LOVE JUICES ARE GOING TO EXPLODE OUT OF MY POOTER.

Jimmy: WHAT? Melissa: GOD! Carl: LAST NIGHT, MELISSA THOUGHT THAT WE HAD... OH, MY GOD! DONE IT AGAIN. BUT... I WAS SOUND ASLEEP! OH, MY GOD! BUT SOMEONE HAD... OH, MY GOD! DONE IT TO MELISSA. Jimmy: OH, YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS HER? THAT I... NO! THAT WOULD BE... NO! I MEAN, NO! WAIT... WAIT A SECOND! LET... LET ME JUST SEE SOMETHING. [ Sniffing ] NO! I MEAN, NO! WAIT! Carl: THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE. YOU WERE MY BEST FRIEND. Jimmy: CARL, I AM YOUR BEST FRIEND. WE JUST, UH... WE... WE HAD A LITTLE MIX-UP IS ALL. Carl: A LITTLE MIX-UP? Melissa: CALM DOWN, CARL. IT DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING. Carl: THIS IS HORRIBLE. NOW WHEN THE EGG COMES OUT WE WON'T KNOW IF IT'S MY BABY OR HIS. Melissa: IT'S YOURS, CARL. Carl: BUT WE CAN'T BE SURE OF THAT. WHAT IF THE BABY LOOKS JUST LIKE JIMMY AND NOT ME? WHAT IF IT'S HIS BABY? Melissa: NO! IT CAN'T BE HIS BABY! Carl: YES, IT CAN! I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE JIMMY'S BABY. Melissa: I CAN'T HAVE JIMMY'S BABY 'CAUSE WE DIDN'T DO IT IN THE REGULAR WAY, OKAY! [ Stopping of ??? ] [ ??? ] Narrator: A NINE-WEEK GESTATION PERIOD IS UPON THEM. Melissa: IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL. IT WAS LATE, HE WAS DESPERATE. Carl: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM. Melissa: I STILL THINK THAT YOU NEED TO FORGIVE HIM. Carl: I CAN'T. HE WAS IN YOUR BUTT. Melissa: YEAH. I REMEMBER. Carl: I'M UPSET ON SO MANY LEVELS WITH THIS, MELISSA. Melissa: WELL, I AM TOO, CARL. Carl: I THINK I'M GOING TO GO FOR A WALK. Melissa: THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, CARL. YOU CAN ALWAYS GO FOR A WALK. [ ??? ] Carl: ? WE WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS ? ? AND THEN HE CAME UP FROM BEHIND ? ? AND TURNED MY LIFE AROUND ? ? AND SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND ? ? I KNOW DEEP DOWN SHE LOVES ME ? ? EVEN THOUGH INSIDE HE SLID ? IT HURTS... ? 'CAUSE HE LOVED HER IN A WAY I NEVER DID ? ? OH, YES HE LOVED HER ? ? IN A WAY I NEVER DID ? ? WHY ? ? CAN'T I TRY ? ? TO LET IT DIE? ? ?

I MUST FORGET HE EVER LOVED HER ? ? HE DIDN'T REALLY LOVE HER ? ? HE JUST KIND OF PLUGGED HER ? ? IN A WAY I NEVER DID ? ? DID ? [ Applause ] Narrator: THE DIFFICULTIES THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH TOGETHER MAKES THE MALE EVEN MORE PUSSY-WHIPPED THAN HE WAS BEFORE. Carl: MELISSA, I'VE GIVEN IT A LOT OF THOUGHT. I KNOW WHAT JIMMY DID WAS AN ACCIDENT. I'M SORRY I WAS SO SELF-ABSORBED ESPECIALLY AT SUCH A POIGNANT MOMENT IN OUR LIVES. Melissa: [ Panting ] I FORGIVE YOU, CARL. CAN YOU... CAN YOU JUST HOLD ON FOR ONE SECOND? HOO, HOO, HEE. HOO, HOO, HEE. OH, OH, AH! AH, OH! OH, MY GOD THAT FRICKIN' HURT. SAY HELLO TO YOUR NEW BABY, CARL. Carl: HELLO. HE'S SO CUTE AND ROUND. Melissa: UH, THAT'S JUST THE EGG. Carl: I KNOW THAT. Melissa: THINK FAST, CARL. Female voice: [ On speaker ] AND BECKHAM SCORES! [ Cheering ] Narrator: THE EGG MUST BE KEPT WARM. THE FATHER STUFFS THAT EGG UP INSIDE HIS NUTLESS SACK FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS. IT IS DURING THIS TIME THAT THE MOTHER MUST MAKE HER JOURNEY TO THE OCEAN TO FEED BEFORE SHE DIES OF STARVATION. THE FEMALE PENGUINS ARE INCREDIBLY STRONG. THEY'VE NOT EATEN IN MANY MONTHS, THEY'VE JUST GIVEN BIRTH, AND NOW THEY ALSO HAVE TO WALK 70 MILES TO THE OCEAN IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. Vicky: [ Singing ] ? I'M NOT SURE BUT THIS I KNOW ? All: ? SHE'S NOT SURE BUT THIS SHE KNOWS ? ? PENGUIN DICKS GET MIGHTY OLD ? ? PENGUIN DICKS GET MIGHTY OLD ? ? 70 MILES ON THESE TINY LEGS ? ? 70 MILES ON THESE TINY LEGS ? ? WHILE OUR BITCHES STAY HOME SITTIN' ON OUR EGGS ? ? WHILE OUR BITCHES STAY HOME SITTIN' ON OUR EGGS ? ? SHOUT OUT ? ? FUCK THEM ? [ ??? ] Carl: IT'S NOT THE MOST COMFORTABLE THING SITTING ON AN EGG, HUH? Marcus: IT'D BE A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IF I WASN'T SITTIN' ON MY DICK TOO. Jimmy: HI, MARCUS. CARL. Marcus: HEY, JIMMY! HOW'S IT HANGIN'? Jimmy: CARL, I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO OR SAY ANYMORE. Carl: YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, JIMMY. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID WAS AN ACCIDENT. Jimmy: ALL I'VE WANTED WAS YOUR FORGIVENESS, MAN. IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION I'VE BEEN ALL ALONE. Carl: WELL, NOT ANY MORE. YOU'VE GOT ME AND MELISSA AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN UNCLE. Marcus: THIS IS SO NICE! THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY! IT TAKES A BIG MAN TO FORGIVE HIS FRIEND AFTER HE... BUSTS HIS WOMAN'S BOOTY HOLE OPEN. [ ??? ] Narrator: 70 MILES AND THREE MONTHS LATER THE WOMEN HAVE ARRIVED AT THEIR MUCH- AWAITED DINING SPOT. THE PROBLEM IS, THE HOLE IN THE ICE IS FROZEN OVER. Vicky: HEY, HELEN. WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAND ON THAT THIN PATCH OF ICE THERE AND MAKE A NICE HOLE FOR ALL OF US TO DIVE INTO. Helen: YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL. Helen: NOW, IF YOU EXCUSE ME, I'M GOING TO BE THE FIRST TO DINE. [ Gasp ] Seal: MMM! Helen: OH! OH, NO! Seal: MMM, COME HERE, BABY! Helen: OH... OH, MY GOD! Seal: COME NOW, DIRTY ROTTEN PENGUIN. HA, HA, HA, HA! AH! Penguins: [ Screaming ] Helen: HE GOT ME IN THE ASS! Seal: THIS PENGUIN'S DELISH... Female: WELL, SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE WENT OUT THERE. Seal: OH, OH, MMM. IS THERE COFFEE? Narrator: IT'S A SAD MOMENT KNOWING THAT THIS MOTHER'S BABY WILL NOT BE FED BECAUSE SHE WILL NOT BE MAKING THE JOURNEY HOME. Seal: MMM! Narrator: BUT THEN AGAIN, SHE WAS SUCH A BITCH. KID'S PROBABLY BETTER OFF. Vicky: WE NEED A MOMENT OF SILENCE PLEASE, FOR THE LOSS OF OUR SISTER, HELEN. A'IGHT, LET'S EAT. [ Mixed chatter ] [ ??? ] Narrator: THE MALE HAS GONE OVER 125 DAYS WITHOUT FOOD. BUT FOOD IS THE LAST THING ON HIS MIND THE MOMENT HIS CHILD IS BORN. [ ??? ] AND THEN... OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES COMES: Chick: FU-UCK! Narrator: THROUGH AN INEXPLICABLE INSTINCTUAL LINK, THE MOTHERS KNOW THEY HAVE GOT TO GET HOME NOW. AND THAT BEAUTIFUL DAY COMES WHEN THE FAMILY IS UNITED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. Vicky: MARCUS! Marcus: BABY! [ ??? ] Vicky: OH, MARCUS. SHE'S SO CUTE. OH, AND LOOK. SHE HAS YOUR PENIS. Marcus: WHAT? Vicky: OH, MARCUS. I'M JUST FUCKIN' WITH YOU. Carl: MELISSA! Melissa: CARL! OH, MY GOD! Chick: FUCK! LOOK, IT'S A BOY, HONEY. Chick: FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! Melissa: OH, CARL. HE HAS YOUR NEUROTIC GLARE. AW, HI THERE LITTLE NEUROTIC-LOOKING BABY. AW. [ Chuckling ] [ ??? ] Jimmy: HI, GUYS. Carl: HI, JIMMY. Melissa: HEY, JIMMY. IT'S UNCLE JIMMY NOW. Melissa: OH, CARL. THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY. I'D DO A LITTLE HAPPY DANCE IF MY FEET WEREN'T COVERED IN BLOODY BLISTERS. [ Laughing ] [ ??? ] Narrator: WITH FEEDING THE BABIES GROW INCREDIBLY FAST. Chick: I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD THAT FOURTH PIECE OF HERRING. [ Sigh ] Narrator: THE BABIES ARE UP AND ALMOST READY TO MOVE ON EXCEPT FOR THE FEW WHO MAY HAVE A LEARNING DISABILITY. Chick: I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD THAT FOURTH PIECE OF HERRING. [ Sigh ] [ ??? ] Narrator: AND SO OUR STORY COMES TO AN END. THE BIG QUESTION IS DO PENGUINS STAY TOGETHER? ARE THEY MONOGAMOUS? Marcus: THAT'S IT, VICKY. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MOVE ON. YOU'RE TOO STRONG FOR ME, BABY. Vicky: GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE, MARCUS. NOW I DIDN'T GO THROUGH ALL THAT TO HAVE YOU GO BACK OUT THERE AND START FUCKING EVERYTHING THAT DOESN'T MOVE. Narrator: THE ANSWER IS, IN REALITY, THEY DO NOT STAY TOGETHER. BUT THIS IS NOT REALITY. THIS IS A FARCE. THE FARCE OF THE PENGUINS. Juan Sanchez: I MADE IT! JUAN SANCHEZ IS AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN! I AM SO STINKY AND DIRTY, I AM ONE DIRTY SANCHEZ! I AM THE KING OF THE WORLD! I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD! A-AH! I AM ONE DIRTY SANCHEZ! Male: FUCKING GLOBAL WARMING! MY GOD, THEY WENT AND DID IT! DAMN YOU ALL! DAMN YOU! [ Echoing ] Narrator: HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
