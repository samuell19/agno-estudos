(dramatic electronic music) (tense melodic music) (electronic bleeping) - Are you? - [Dynastud] Are you my contact? - Depends on who is asking. - [Dynastud] I'm asking. And that's all you need to know. - My name is-- - Is Fredrich Gerlich. And I meant what I said on the phone. I am the best. - I can see that. - Leave the money on the table. (light melodic electronic music) (wind howling) Which one do you want? - And welcome back to the 2024 Republican Presidential Debates, brought to you by our sponsor, Crystal Clear, America's leading coal refining organization. (groans) (softly chuckles) - Is this your first time? (speaking foreign language) - Why would you think that? My organization has bought many of your politicians in the past. - Well, then. You must have a lot of experience. And if you don't, that's okay. I don't judge. I have my money, and I can take it nice and slow. - [Kelly] We are here in one of Crystal Clear's mines, 800 feet below ground, with our top three candidates. And tonight's debate will decide who will get the nod. What should we, as a nation, do about the homosexual menace? Let's start with Governor Gary McMan. - In the last eight years, we have finally moved out of the dark ages of tolerance and diversity. Homosexuals are no longer allowed to taint the sacred bond of marriage, nor are they allowed to be employed as teachers or serve in our military. And now, with Directive 48 in place, sodomy is now a criminal offense. Punishable by death. But because this is a Christian nation, I believe that's enough punishment for these poor devils. So, I say, keep the laws as they stand. - Neither that one. He appears to have the intelligence of a Belgian peanut farmer. - And same question to Congressman Kellogg, and that's a mighty fine hat you're wearing there, Congressman. - Well, shoot. Thank you there, Kelly. (chuckles) Now, I must echo the words of my good friend, Gary. We are a Christian nation, so we need to show mercy on these poor bastards, but if they obey the law, then maybe, just maybe we can help these poor son of a bitches rejoin society eventually, but not in my neighborhood. - No, no. He reminds too much of my father. He was a raper of sheep! - And finally, to Senator Teddy Hightower. - These two fuckin' guys are queer for each other. (gun shot booming) (gasping) (gun shot booming) And that's my answer for what we should do about the homosexual menace in this country. - How about that one? He looks a reptile! - Teddy Hightower. Excellent choice. Now, shall we seal the deal? - How do we do that? (intense music) (gasps) - Like this. - How did you do that? (smooching) - Now. I want to see that two bit tux hit the floor. (intense melodic rock music) (belt whipping)) (zipper scratching) (grunting) Take it, bitch. Here I come! (squishy explosion splattering) (eerie suspenseful music) Mission accomplished. Please send next assignment. Room service! Could you please send up a maid? I know they're not due until morning, but this one mess, I'm sure, they're gonna want a headstart on.

What are ya in for tonight? - What have you got? - Oh, Bartholomew. It's you. You want a blue pin. - That's right. Please, call me Bart. - You let me know when you decide to try red. Got me? - Oh, you'll be the first to know, Zelda. (giggling) (softly moaning) - What are ya havin', Bart? - [Bart] Vodka soda. - I'll get that for ya, boy. - Comin' right up. - Thank you very much, sir. That's very kind. - Anything for a cute little guy like you, sailor. - My name is Bart. - I haven't seen you here before. you come here often, Bart? - Not as often as I like. - I've come here often. You want to join me in the back room? Help me come again? (panting) - You're so hot. (laughing) (moaning) - You want this? - Yeah. - [Man] It's all yours, boy. (moaning and panting) (laughing) - Ah, it's just with my daughter. It is so stupid. She can't keep her panties on! She'll fuck any guy that looks at her cross-eyed. She has no concept of the reality that this will make me look bad right before the election! - You better lock that down before she gets prego. - Don't you think I know that? I have to find some way to get Patty married off before she gets knocked up. - Is it really that big a deal? - Yes, it is. She's fucked two of the gardeners, done anal with my accountant, laid the Utah Jazz, and Friday, she blew the chauffer. - Blew the chauffer? That's just bad taste. - Poor girl. She's just too easily led. She can't walk out the door without accidentally catching a random panoply of dicks. And worse, she likes it. - And honestly, she's not even that good at it. - Did you fuck my daughter, too? (stammering) - No! I mean, I thought you knew! (gun shot booming) - For God's sakes, you can't trust anyone not to butter your daughter's muffin. You didn't fuck her, did you? - No, no, no, not a chance. - Good. Then you can give me some advice. - Advice? - Yes. How do I find a man to marry my daughter? Someone I can control. - Why don't you just pay a guy? - Common gigolo for my daughter? I don't think so. Besides, once those guys get a taste of money, they won't be stopped. No, I need someone dumb and unambitious. - What about a prisoner? You let them go, they owe you everything. Plus, built-in blackmail. - Prisoner, huh? That idea has promise. (snickering) - Yes! Yes! Ah, there's the magic! Yeah! (raspy panting) - [Bart] Hey, do you want me to swallow? - No! Get it all over your face! Oh, I'm gonna shoot! (groaning) Yeah. (panting) - [Bart] Was that good for you? - Kid, you're under arrest. The evidence is all over ya. (laughing) (camera shutter clicking) - You want me to what?! - My daughter needs a husband. A man to keep her in line. You're familiar with Ephesians 5:22? - "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's ass?" - No. It's, "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands "as you do to the Lord." - Yeah, I'm a flibberty-jibbit. - Shut your hole, Patty, daddy's talking. You see, she needs a man's hand to keep her in line. (gun shot booming) (gasping) (gun shot booming) (gasping) Don't flinch! My daughter is not going to marry a flincher! - What Senator Hightower's trying to say is that he would like you enter into a marriage contract with his daughter. And in return, your criminal record will be sealed. - Sealed? - Yes, legal proceedings against you would cease for as long as you remain under contract. Otherwise, I'm sure you understand. You will face confinement, followed by a painful execution for your salacious crimes against humanity and God. - Well, I don't know if I want to marry a God criminal! - Silence, Patty, or no pumpkin spice. - Ah beans, I never get to say nothin'! (cooing) Yes! - The contract will be absolutely binding. You will remain married until you produce an heir and for 11 years after that. Then you are free to pursue your own arrangements. And in the meantime, everything will be provided for. You'll live in a fancy mansion with your new wife, have people to cook and clean for you. - I already have that! - Cram up, pumpkin, this isn't about you. - What if I leave early? What if I break my contract? - Well, the MAGA Police would pick you back up. But more than likely, I would have you killed. - What?! (gun shot booming) (shouts) (gun shot booming) (shouts) You can't just kill me! (gun shot booming) (gasps) (giggling) - Tonight, I'm gonna fuck you so hard, I'm gonna break your dick off! (laughing) - Senator Hightower. - Bart, please, you're my son-in-law now. Call me Senator. - Alright, then. - Now, tonight, I want you to fuck my daughter until she breaks your dick off. - Oh, daddy! - Welcome to the family, Bart! (laughing) (screaming) (gentle dreamy music) - Bart! I'm ready for your pecker now! - I love women. I love Patty. I love boobies, not men's hard, throbbing cocks and tight butts and... This has gotta be normal! This has to be normal, or I'm gonna be killed! Please, God, please, let me get hard for her! - Bartholomew! I want you in my tunnel of love! It's sopping wet like a spongecake! - Well, now I'm completely flaccid. (gentle music) - Pumpkin, what are you doing in there while I'm out here?! (sighs) - I'm gonna die. (bushes rustling) (birds calling) (groans) Oh, my dick! (panting) (groaning) (gasps) (eerie electronic music) Hey. - Let me ask you a question. - Okay. - Can you fly? - Um, what? - [Dynastud] I said, can you fly? - Of course I can't fly. - Are you Bartholomew James Cooper of 91 Ridgeway Road, Portsmouth, New Hampshire? - I am, but what are you? - Huh, it says here you can fly. It's even underlined. Well, do you have a slick motorcycle, or a badass muscle car, or something that we can take off in style with? 'Cause my car is in the shop. Well, actually, it was repossessed. - Look, I'm kinda in a hurry and all, and wait, did you say take off? You want me to go with you? - Indeed. - Why? - It's a long story. But I am an incredibly handsome and rugged man. And you are a flightless homosexual with what appears to be a rock hard erection. What other reason do you need? - I just ate about 20 Viagra. - Well, point the way, old chum, 'cause it looks like we're hoofin' it from here. (light music) - Bartholomew! You haven't even been able to your P in my V yet! - [Gaydar] Hoo, girl, there's danger ahead. - Sir, are you okay? - My Gaydar, it's going off. I can't control it. - [Gaydar] Sugar, we don't have time for the sex position. We got bad guys to catch. - Gaydar? What's Gaydar? - It's one of my superpowers. - Wait, you have superpowers? - What kind? - Super hearing, super strength, among them is Gaydar, an internalized voice that alerts me to crimes against our kind. It's a great defense mechanism. It can also be bitchy. And give me migraines. - [Gaydar] But it can save my life. - Shut up, Gaydar. - [Gaydar] Whatevs. - That's wild. What other kind of abilities do you have? Do you have x-ray vision? (electronic bleeping) - No. - Well, can you fly? - Can't fly. But I can glide short distances. - Bitchin'. I want to help you. I feel like I'm supposed to be here, like it's my destiny! - All will be revealed in time, Bart. - I feel compelled to drop to my knees and pleasure you right now. - That happens, yeah. - What's your name? - Call me Dynastud. (zipper scratching) - You got it, Dynastud! (moaning) (light music) - Checkmate! - Huh. (laughing) Checkmate. (laughing) (gun shot booming) Jarvis! It's time for my tea. - Yes, sir. - Oh, and uh, clean this shit up. - Yes, Senator. Your daughter just arrived and wishes to see you. - Patty? But it's the first day of her honeymoon! (sobbing) - Daddy! - Princess! What did that little cocksucker do to you? (sobbing) - Don't touch me! (sobbing) - Wait. (bushes rustling) That's enough. - Was it something I said? Did I use too much teeth? - Yes, but that's besides the point. I can't come, not like this. - Why not? Is it some kind of kinky tantric sex thing? - The world as we know it, it's going to change soon. - That's hot, now let me finish what I started. - No, Bart! My orgasm is lethal! It would blow your head clean off! - I'm startin' to like the sound of that. - No, Bart, literally. Your skull would explode the second I reach orgasm. - Hot. - No, Bart! In a bad way. It's a superpower I can't control. The intensity of my orgasm kills people. Their heads explode! Men, women, people of the transgender persuasion, farm animals. (gentle melodic music) You don't know what it's like, to have to go around with perpetual blue balls. It's the burden of my superpowers, to be eternally sexy, but unable to get off without destroying my partner. (awing) - Poor Dynastud. Come here. (gently sighs) (moaning and panting) - No wait, it's too dangerous! - Can't I just give you a handy?! - No! My salty soft serve would destroy these fine woodlands. And I am firm believer in forest conservation. I must remain pure with you for now. - Really?! - Yes. I need you, Bart. Your essence, your impact on me is undeniable. But I don't need you in the ways you might expect. (light music) (thudding) (doorbell dinging) (upbeat melodic music) - There you go. This will help calm you down, stop your crying. (sighing) - [Teddy] Will she be alright, doctor? - Well, like all women who have been spurned by men, she's gone a little crazy, lost her place in the world. - I feel woozy. - Senator Hightower, the two MAGA Agents are here to see you. - Good, I'll meet them in the dining room. Are you all finished with her, doctor? Will this keep her from whining? - One more item. Her banana basket needs to be filled, so I brought these to help her feel full and satisfied, until you find her man again. - Oh my. - Dr. Chutney, you're a genius! I'll leave you to it. (cap popping) (light elevator music) Gentlemen, thank you for coming. I have a problem. I need you to track down my daughter's husband. He left just as he was about to plow Patty and give me an heir. I heard you two were the best. - Is this your daughter here, in that photo? - Yes. That was Patty in happier times. She used to be quite the equestrian. Sadly, we had to shoot the horse. She was becoming too attached. (slurping) Ha, memories. By the way, how is your tea? (tea splashing) - Tastes like my Aunt Rosalie's vagina after an 18 hour shift at the sauerkraut factory. - I kinda like it. - Well, touch my balls! Sam likes it! Well, let's thrown a fuckin' parade! Sorry, I recently quit smoking, and I'm on the patches. (groaning) But enough about me! This chode we're talking about, do you have a picture of him? (groans) - Glamor shots. Are you sure this guy's not gay? - Let me remind you that homosexuality is illegal. - I didn't mean to imply anything. - He does look kind of fruity, though. - Oh, daddy, I feel much better. - Glad to hear it, pumpkin. - These are Agent Sam and Detective Vargas. They're going to help track down Bart and get him to want to fuck you again. (sobbing) Oh no, dummy, don't cry over him. He's worthless! As you can see, gentlemen, my daughter is distraught over her ignominious jilting. - Left at the altar, huh? - Worse! Left in the marriage bed. Well, you can see the toll it's taken on her. Her face distorted by tears, her once gorgeous knockers, sagging with humiliation. (sobbing) - I'm undesirable! - No! - I don't know. I think you're lookin' pretty good. I mean, crazy, sad, and dressed like one of those girls from Brazzers. Oh, I fucking love those girls! (laughing) And your tears, enticing. I love a woman with ready access to her emotions. And this so-called husband ran away from this tight package?! Why, it seems to me like your husband might be a good old freckle puncher! - Vargas! - I'm sorry! Sorry! I meant homosexual. Not you, he's into the wang is what I'm saying! - Do you think you could describe the man that kidnapped your husband? - Well, I only got a quick look at him when he ran off with my Bart, and it was really dark, so I'm not sure how good I'm gonna be at this, but he was tall, like 6'2". - Good, good. - And he was beautiful, like a Greek God! He had one of those torsos that taper down from broad, muscular shoulders to a narrow waist, and he had hands, like the paws of a great cat! Like a tiger with fingers! And his butt rode kinda high and rounded. - Okay okay, enough! What do ya got? Dynastud! (eerie music) (water dripping) - You know, I usually love a man in uniform. But you, not so much. - Well, today is the last day that I wear this uniform. I'm sure you didn't hear the news from your cell, but starting tomorrow, I will be a United States Senator! (chuckles) I think a congratulations are in order. - I'm gonna kill you. (chuckles) - No, you're not. In fact, you're going to join the party. - What are you gonna do? Lobotomize me? - I'm going to have the gay beaten out of you. Meet Gunther! Hobbies include stock car racing, weight training, and busting skulls. - Yipes! - Gunther crush Dynastud! (electronic guitar rock music) (punches thudding) (grunting) - You punch like a fag. (whooshing) - Find him, you idiot! (heavy rock music) (punch thudding) (grunting) (groaning) (punch thudding) (grunting) (clanking) (whooshing) (grunting) (clanking) (groaning) (screaming) (splooshing) There's the big gun I was expecting. (gun shot booming) (suspenseful music) (shouting) (grunting) - This whole place is under surveillance. If you kill me, it'll give them reason to track your kind down. - I'm gonna keep you alive, but only because I wanna see you rot in the cooler. - That'll be the day. That man is a dangerous enemy of the state. When you find him, kill him without hesitation. But be sure and bring Bart back alive. - Do you really think you'll be able to find him, Detective Vargas? - Oh, my sweet vagina galore, we'll track him down and bring him back to you. And he'll be in your arms and balls deep in your vag before the next episode of Who Told You You Could Dance is on. - Well, I'm glad that's settled. (ball clanking) - What was that? - Uh, one of Dr. Chutney's balls just dropped. (smooching) - [Gaydar] Dynastud, if you could take a minute to stop checking out Bart's ass, we have a red menace that has to be dealt with. (insects chirping) - Why are we stopping? - Just a little something I have to take care of. - Do you think they have something to drink in there? I'm getting thirsty from all this walking. - Inside will be a tall, cool glass of justice. (footsteps clanking) - What's in here? - Russian bot farm. - They grow bots? - No, they grow the seeds of discontent that poison the fertile fields of Democracy. - You know, whenever you talk like that, I get rock hard. Why is that? - I've got a plan. And it involves you. But it's gonna require Cracker Jack timing and a high probability of lethal force. - Wait. What is a Russian bot farm doing in America? - Bart, they're Russians. They're sneaky like that. (keyboards clacking) - Alexi! What is good word rhyme with snowflake? - Earthquake! (speaking foreign language) - Krinkov, what is it you are working on? - Boris, I work on very funny meme of Ronald Reagan spanking Hillary Clinton with a large black dildo! (laughing) - Much liberal tears will flow when they see that, I tell you! (laughing) Okay! - Today I pretend to be black man on Twitter who wants to make with the pregnant of white girls and leave them on the footsteps! (laughing) (doorbell dinging) (grunts) (light music) - Do we know of anyone coming? (speaking foreign language) - Do Boris? - Also (speaking foreign language). (doorbell ringing) (sighs) (suspenseful music) - Hello! - [Bart] Pizza delivery! - What? - [Bart] Pizza delivery for 233 Industrial Way. - Is us, what kind of pizza is being? - Um, saucy deep dish. - No! What is it made of? (punch whapping) (grunting) - Whoa! You know, I never thought that was gonna work. (groaning) - They're Russians, Bart, they're not very bright. - Eating now second amendment. (gun shots booming) It's useless, guns don't kill people! (gun shots booming) Die (speaking foreign language)! (whooshing) - That's cocksucker to you both. (gun shots booming) (intense melodic music) What, are you gonna hack me to death? - No, you cannot ban me. I'm having a free speech. (shouting) - Do I look like the government? - Send backup! Big sexy gay man is here killing everybody! (shouting) - Tell me who is paying you or I'll give you Borges bell. - Hightower! Teddy Hightower! - I knew it. Well, I want you to give Teddy a special message from me. - Anything! Just don't kill me, big sexy gay man! (whispering) Oh, fuck! (playful music) - Clearly this poor girl's husband has been abducted by Dynastud. Probably turned him gay already through the power of his sexual mesmerism! Oh, it's safe to assume they're in cahoots! And clearly, those queers are armed and dangerous! But where the hell are they headed? - Bottom's Up. - Sam, it's a bit early for day drinking, but what the hell, what have you got on ya? - No, no, Bottom's Up, the underground bar on the Canadian border for gays escaping the U.S. to the Great White North. They must be headed there. (eerie music) (door creaking) (door clanking) - Hi, dad! (gasping) - Leaping lawn jockeys! Oh, it's only you, pussycat. - Daddy, I'm so sad. - Oh, God damn that Bart. And Dr. Chutney, he was supposed to make you better! (ball clanking) What the hell was that? - Oh, it's one of those balls from Tibet Dr. Chutney gave me, and now when I'm really sad, they just come out. Do you want to go get ice cream with me? - Oh, sorry, pookie. I have to check on the progress of our super weapon development program. - Oh, (ball clanking), okay. Daddy, do you miss mommy? - Not really. I mean, I was the one who had her killed after she kept giving me girl babies. (chuckles) (footsteps pattering) - Bye, dad. (ball clanking) (electronic bleeping) - Good afternoon, Senator! - Dr. Chutney! Okay, then. Let's see it. - The weapon is almost complete. Behold! (gasping) - It's beautiful! Will it work? - Will it work?! (laughing) Senator! When the weapon is complete, all we need to do is fire it, and any homosexual will become a heterosexual. Think about it. Lesbians touching penises. Gays munching the rug. (laughing) We just point and shoot! Shoot straight! (laughing) - Oh, they won't know what hit them. And after we capture Bart, that errant cocksucker will be able to please my daughter and give me an heir. (laughing) Oh, this is mine. (gasping) It comes with one of these! (laughing) - All this laughing is making me dehydrated. - And after we get my daughter's man, all the gays will drop to their knees. (laughing) Get it! - [Together] Their knees! (laughing) (thudding) (intriguing music) (birds chirping) - We piss here. (zippers scratching) - Where are you taking me? - To a compound. Just over the border in Canada. A secret gay bar called Bottom's Up. - And what's in this Bottom's Up? - A safe passage that will lead me to the only man I ever really loved. - Love. (urine splashing) - Hey. Nice cock, Bart. I'm a top, myself. But it's got a really beautiful shape and an impressive girth. You'll make a bottom very happy some day. - Thanks. By the way, you never told me how you got your superpowers. - Do you really need to know? - Well, yeah. I'm curious. - I was bit by a radioactive spider. - I've heard this one before. - It was a gay radioactive spider. Chucked gooey white wads of-- - Yeah, alright, all caught up, thanks. - Okay. If you must know, (light music) I wasn't always the hunk of smoldering man flesh you see before you now. I was a scrawny nerd, born on a farm in Vermont. I had two loving mothers named May and Martha. (joyful music) Well, one night, I was out catching fireflies, and I saw something fall from the sky. - [Orb] Do not be afraid of me. I have come from a distant star to bring peace to your waring planet and wisdom light years beyond your own. - Awesome! - [Orb] Uh, um, wait. What did you say? - Awesome! - [Orb] Ah, fuck me sideways! Is this 51 Pegasus B? - No, this is Earth. - [Orb] Sometimes you have to wonder who's mindin' the storm. Okay, fine, Earth. You backwards monkeys have your troubles, too, I guess. Now, how do you solve them here? Hold on, let me check the database. (electronic bleeping) Superheroes, huh? Okay, fine. You'll be a superhero, how does that sound? - Sounds great! - [Orb] A real quiz kid, huh? Well listen, there's one problem. If I change you into a superhero, you must heed this warning. - Nah, I'm good. - [Orb] Goddammit, this is bad! It will effect your life, your entire life! - Let's just do this! - [Orb] Can't you just wait a second?! - No, I wanna be big and strong! - Oy vey, this meshugganah wants to be a superhero! Okay, fine. Here we go! (suspenseful music) - Look at me. I'm beautiful. I can so seriously get laid with a bod like this. No more lonely nights with the milking machine for me. (smooching) - [Orb] Yeah, about that! - [Dynastud] It made me into the irresistible stud I am today. But great beauty comes with a terrible price. (funky club music) - This is my first time. Be gentle, Jeremiah. - This is my first time, too. And call me Dynastud. - I'll call you anything you want me to, Dynastud. (moaning) (groaning) (explosion booming) (animals calling) - What have I become?! My penis was a lethal weapon, and I had a license to thrill. Thankfully, no matter what, I had the unconditional love of my mothers. Momma May? - Mm-hmm? - Can I ask you about love? (laughing) - You're growin' up so fast, aren't you? - We've had to buy him all new clothes, just look at those shoulders! (laughing) - What's your question, baby boy? (light music) - Do you think it's bad to love someone if you know you're going to destroy them? - Yes. Yes, I do. With powerful love, comes a great duty. We must never allow those we love come to harm. - But what if you really need to love someone, but you know they'll be hurt? - It's such a big question for a young man. If your love will hurt someone, then it really isn't love, is it? - Guess not. - That's right. Now go to sleep, Jeremiah. - Don't call me Jeremiah anymore. Call me Dynastud. (laughing) - You crazy kids and your nicknames. (laughing) (light music) - Dynastud. Dynastud. - [Vargas] Tonight, we head into the heart of darkness. - I'm not scared. (laughing) - Who knows what horrors these homos have going on?! - Gay people don't bother me. - Well, they should bother you. Because they bother me, ergo, they should bother you! With their glitter and their parades. (scoffs) And the Queer as Folk television series on the BBC. Well, you better enjoy that bologna sandwich 'cause tonight, we go undercover. - What are you talking about? (laughing) - We need to understand them, Sam, hm? We need to think like them, understand them, become them. Gay men! That's right, I'll be the pitcher, and you'll be the catcher! On this hardball team of hard balls! Playin' the ball game, oh yes! We will play balls. - Maybe you should take up smoking again. (laughing) - Sam, Samwise Gamgee! Tonight we might be smoking a big bag of dicks. (sniffing) (groaning) And who knows! At the end of all this, you might get a real piece of bologna in your mouth. Take it, take it! (intense melodic rock music) - This is it? It doesn't look like much. - This is it. We're here to meet my old friend, the meanest drag queen in all of Canada. He goes by the nom de guerre of Lee Van Queef. - Sounds like a gas. (knocking) (door creaking) - Password? - To a new world of Gods and monsters. (club music thumping) - Who's that man with the ass I just want to eat a steak and egg breakfast off of? Burma Zapper, you can still bounce Loonies off this thing! - Oh, Lee, you old butt pirate. - Dynastud, you magnificent bastard, bring it in! (slapping) Who's Peter Pan? - I'm Bart. - Pleasure to meet you Bart. Welcome to Bottom's Up, the last free zone in America. We've been the final stop for the queer underground railroad for years, helpin' these wonderful people get their letters of transit to Canada, where they can live in freedom. - I've seen Lee take down an entire battalion of MAGA Shock Troops without even breaking a nail. - Oh, Dynastud, you always knew how to flatter a girl. Now, both of you come with me. I've got what you need in my office. (club music thumping) - This place is like an armory. - [Lee] Hold that for me, sugar. (clicking) - Lee, people would kill for this! - What is it? - It's a Canadian passport. - Operation Neon Cobra has begun. - What's Operation Neon Cobra? - Boss, there's an unidentified car outside. - Looks like you boys brought trouble with you. Bobo, back door. - Gladly. - No, take them out the back door! And use protection! - I don't know, I'm kind of a bareback man myself. - Goddammit, Bobo. Take this. - Yes, boss. Pushy old queen. - Lee, will you be okay? - Of course, baby, just make sure to say hello to Bruce for me. (slapping) (club music thumping) - Goddammit. - Oh, stop pouting, Sam. - I told you I wanted to be the Indian. - You're not the Indian! You're the construction worker! - And I say goddammit! - I didn't write the song YMCA, Sam. It takes a man of certain moral character to be the Indian. And I'm the goddamn Indian! - Hey there, cutie. Nice buskins. - Hello, fellow gay man! Now, should I insert my penis into your mouth now or later? - I am married, asshole! Jeez, just take the compliment. (smooching) - That guy totally wanted my cock. - Nope. - Let's try a new tactic. (electronic club music) Hello! We come in peace, and we love to fuck butts! - You fuckin' creep! (shouting) - Jesus! - Pardon me. Would you like to talk about RuPaul's Drag Race? - You know, I'd love to, but I was just about to leave. I gotta get to a Gilbert and Sullivan rehearsal. - Well, we should get together and hang out sometime. - You know, I'd like that. I feel like there's been a real connection between us. Call me. Bye! - My God, Sam! You're like the gay whisperer! You can think like them, infiltrate them, penetrate them! Oh, you're going to lead us straight to Dynastud! Let's dance! (electronic club music) (shouting) Why are you all flocking to him? - [Man] He's hot, dude. - He's super hot. - I just love this retro thing. - Why the fuck are they attracted to you and not me, Sam?! - Especially 'cause you're the Indian, too! - Oh, fuck you! - Fuck you! (record scratching) - You can't stop the music! (funky club music) Sup, sweet tits? (slapping) (groaning) - The name's Lee Van Queef. - Wow. (scoffs) I'd hit that. I mean, I know you're a dude and all, but I have tape. We can tuck it. - I provide my own tape, copper top. I am a professional. - So, Mrs. Van Queef, we know you're hiding Dynastud and Bart! So, where are they?! - Why would I tell a couple pigs like you anything? - We're the law. - Well, I'm the law of the jungle, motherfucker. And I would like to introduce you to the Bear Squad! (funky music) - We are gonna mop the floor with you two oinkers. - Sam? Deploy the twink, quick! Before they kill us! (whooshing) (grunting) - Ain't it always the way. Fine, let me introduce you to the Alberta chapter of the K.D. Lang fan club! (funky music) - Dear God. Sam, I think we're about to get fucked harder than a $10 whore during fleet week. - We're liberals. We've got kind hearts and bottomless compassion. We love everyone, regardless of their differences. We show tolerance in the face of even the most violent opposition. - Even though you bastards took everything from us, and now we've gotta go live in Canada. - Seriously, I had to leave my beautiful house in Georgia to come move to this moose infested wasteland. - And everyone's so goddamn nice all the time. - So, come to think of it, we really have no choice but to beat you to death. - Vargas, before we die, I need you to know I've always loved you. (awing) - Fag. (shouting) What?! (grunting) - Canadians! (laughing) - They hit like girls. (grunting) (groaning) - Drinks are the house, bitches! ♪ O Canada ♪ ♪ Our home and native land ♪ (insects chirping) (frogs croaking) - Penny for your thoughts, Dynastud? - Eat your s'mores, kid. - What's Operation Neon Cobra? - You'll find out soon enough. - Listen, I'm getting sick of this. You need to start giving me some information because I'm tired of being in the dark all the time and it's frustrating me! - Well, you're gonna have to find a way to relieve that frustration. - Well, I have the perfect way to do that, but it'll cause my head to explode. Jesus Christ, I'm so horny! - It's true. There was only one man who could survive the assault of my sperm cannon. - Lucky him. Was this that Bruce guy? Who was he? - In all my life, I've only ever truly loved one man. And his name is Bruce Li. - You mean the late, great kung-fu master, Bruce Lee? - Not to be confused with that other Bruce guy. His last name is spelled Li. But all the same. He was a great fighter, a mighty warrior, and a true hero. (funky 80s rock music) - Mecha Trump! - [Mecha Trump] Terminate, terminate! (footsteps booming) (zapping) (screaming) - One day Bruce got hurt while shooting a movie in Toronto called Fists of Karma, so he was put in cryogenic freeze. He healed, but nothing could revive him. But then we found the scrolls! And they said that only the seed of one pure of heart could awaken the fallen warrior. And that seed is your semen, Bart. (ominous music) - I'm sorry, what? - Yeah, they were ancient scrolls of foretold-- - No, no, no, no, no. Fuck the scrolls, the other part. - The cryogenic freeze? - No, the part about my man jam! - Your semen will awaken Bruce Li, it is foretold, and so it shall be! - Wait, back to my dick snot for a second. - It also says when we awakens, we will have sex, and there will be an explosive orgasm, and that orgasm will mark the beginning of a new dawn of humanity! - I feel really faint right now. I think I need a candy bar or something. - I need you, Bart. Bruce needs you. America, what's left of it, needs you. You're the lynch pin. What do you say? - Oh, Dynastud, who can say no to you? - No one. That's my gift. And my curse. - I thought your banging dick was your gift and your curse. - I've got a lot of gifts, and a lot of curses. That's what makes me irresistible. That is also my gift and my curse. (light music) - Can't I just suck you off a little bit? - No! It's too dangerous! Why don't I return the favor? - You mean? (zipper scratching) Damn, your smooth! (singing in foreign language) - Go fish. - Burn in hell. (gun shot booming) (thudding) - Shall I clean that up for you, sir? - No! Everyone's getting too complacent around here. Leave him there as a warning to others. - Did, did you hear? Those two MAGA Agents were killed! - No! No! (gun shot booming) No! No! No! (singing in foreign language) Who the fuck did that? - You did! - I did no such thing! - Daddy, I don't mean to criticize, but you might be kind of an asshole. - Well, nobody's gonna miss those two. We'll have 'em buried out in the backyard, next to your mother and the horse. (moaning) - Oh yeah! Oh, I've never felt anything like this before! - Bart, your semen, it glows! You truly are the chosen one. - Hey! I feel used! - Bart, with this seed will grow a mighty tree of justice. - That's it, I've had enough of this. You got what you wanted from me, so my part of this story is over. - It's far from over, Bart. You're a hero deep down inside. Now, you can either go back to America and spend the rest of your life running, or you can join me and change the world for the better. The choice is yours. - I'll take my chances. (frogs croaking) (dark ominous music) - I should probably go wash out my mouth now. (crunching) - Hello? Dynastud, is that you? (cell phone ringing) Looks like my luck's beginning to change. (suspenseful music) (gasping) - Hello, oneeyedyogurtslinger69. - Yeah, that's my username. You can call me Bart. - I am hot for you? - Sure. I didn't know this was a cruising spot. Seems a little out of the way. - I want to be woman for you. - Um, what? You want to? - All over my tits. - Are you feeling okay? - Wait, no. I want to be the man. You be the woman, right? - Are you new at this? - I want to submit to your manly leadership. (gasping) (intense music) That was easy. All these guys care about is getting their rocks off. (grunting) (thuds) (grunting) (electricity zapping) - Kick his ass, Bart! - I can't, I don't believe in violence. - Well, it's time to buck up, buckaroo! - I won't do it! - Time to go home and fuck your wife, Bart. - They're gonna make you fuck a woman, Bart! - It doesn't matter! I won't do it! (screaming) (electricity zapping) (squishy explosion popping) (rustling) - Bart, what's your problem? - Violence! I don't do that! You're the one who said I was pure of heart, I mean, Christ! Do you want my semen to turn toxic? - I don't think that's how it works. - I've been taught to love, not to fight. - Well, sometimes fighting is necessary. It can actually be a great deal of fun. - That's no answer, or even a good excuse. - Look, my point is you need to stop being a pussy, or you're gonna get hurt. - I think you're the one who's afraid of being hurt. (footsteps crunching) - I'm not afraid of anything! I'm Dynastud! I'm a superhero, for God's sakes! I'm every man's nightmare. And every woman's dream. (frogs croaking) - Who the hell is it? What?! They're what? They're both dead?! Are you kidding me? Well, nice talk, adios. (sighs) Goddammit. I'm gonna have to do this myself. (eerie music) - Senator Hightower! - The fuck is wrong with you?! (coughing) - I was trying to be mysterious! Easy, I bruise, I bruise! - I'm here too, dad! - Fuck everything! (groaning) - I'm gonna bleed, I'm gonna bleed. - Where are we going? - You're not coming. - I never get to go anywhere, but this time, I am coming! (groaning) You are not going to leave me like you left mom! (groaning) I will kill this motherfucker before I let you do that! (banging) (groaning) - I've cracked at least three ribs, Patty. And I'm blacking out. - Look, Patty, I'm sorry I wasn't there for you! - Don't you see, it's because of you I am like this! I wanna be in your life, dad! Let me in! I love you! (speaking foreign language) - Come here, sugar lamb. (gentle music) Let's go get your homo husband. (whirring) - Ooh, it has one of those! - Yeah! (squealing) Let's go. (thudding) (waterfall gently splashing) - Why are we stopping? - Look. - [Bart] Is that? - Winnipeg. Land of mystery and magic. But before we go any further, I need you to level with me. Why don't you like violence? Okay, this is happening. - When I was really young, my parents, they took me to a Chuck E. Cheese. - Yes, I could see how that would do it. - No, that's not the whole story. When we were leaving, they were robbed and murdered by a couple of thugs. - Hand over your wallet and your purse, and nobody gets hurt. - I beg your pardon? - Listen, we just want the cash. Give us the money, you can walk away. - This is a Gucci wallet. - And this is an Ivanka Trump signature handbag. - I don't think you understand. I just want your money. Hand it over, or I'm gonna ventilate your wife. - Look, my lobbyist did not work tirelessly to repeal the estate tax laws, so I could keep all of my father's inheritance, just to give it to some parasite looking for a free handout! - Just look at the two of you. I mean, I respect your right to open carry, but you should know better never to threaten people of our skin color. When you see people this pale, think of us like an orange vest during hunting season. - I mean, really, let's talk about how trickle-down economics works. - Trickle this! (gun shot booming) - Whoa! Well, did you hunt these guys down and kill them in a most gruesome fashion? - No. I followed them home, and they kinda took pity on me and adopted me. But they were really nice. - Uh. - And then, in an even stranger turn of events, when we were leaving Build-A-Bear, they were robbed and murdered by another group of thugs who weren't so nice. - Is this because of the radioactive spider thing? Because I was just busting your balls, Bart. - No, this actually happened! - Alright, we're losing daylight, let's go. (waterfall gently splashing) (funky electronic music) - My God! Is that where Bruce Li is stored?! - In that spaceship? No, Bart. In order to get to Bruce Li, we must travel to the outer most reaches of our solar system. Our mission is just beginning. - Bitchin'! (spaceship whooshing) (intense music) - Now I think we should run! (cackling) (shouting) (lasers blasting) (laughing) (whirring) (lasers blasting) - Dynastud, we have something coming up on our tail! (whooshing) - He found us. - Prepare to meet your maker. And in this case, your maker is me. - To the end, I grapple with thee! From hell's heart, I stab at thee! In the name of hate, I spit my last breath at thee! - When did you learn to read? (intense music) (lasers blasting) (explosion booming) - [Bart] We've been hit! - And lost power in the aft engines. We'll never make it to the Canadian mothership. Unless. - Unless?! - You're going to have to blow me, Bart. It might kill you, but I may be able to redirect the force of my orgasm into the ship's main engines, allowing us to go into hyper speed. - Aye aye, captain! (funky music) - This next shot will rob them of their powers. Then we'll board the ship, kill Dynastud, and bring Bart back to Earth. And he can finally board you. - Glass doors open. (whooshing) - More tongue, you fucker! (missiles whooshing) (groaning) Ah, he shoots! Oh, he scores! (moaning) - Why is it so salty, why?! That can't be healthy! - Bart, we're here! Emergency Canadian maple syrup space reserves! Billions and billions of gallons are stored up in there, in case of the death of the world's maple trees. - It tastes like liquid beef jerky. Is there any water on this ship? - Red Maple? Red Maple? This is Dynastud. Requesting permission to board. - [Red Maple] Permission granted. Welcome to the emergency Canadian maple syrup space reserves. The syrup must flow. (electronic bleeping) - Are all these filled with? - Pure maple syrup. The very lifeblood of the Canadian economy. Welcome to the (speaking foreign language). Ooh, and whatever you do, stay away from that big button on the far wall. (ominous music) Funny, I never noticed the naked Asian man until just now. - We'll take it from here. - Sorry, didn't mean to pry. If you need me, I'll be watching my programs. - Welcome, Dynastud, my lover. I've returned to the world again. The wheel of destiny continues apace. (electronic bleeping) (sighs) - Bruce, this is Bart. I believe the one the prophecy's foretold. - He is certainly handsome. (whooshing) - Whoa, what was that? - Yes, and his heart is pure. - Just as the scrolls foretold. - Okay, look. I'm getting at pretty annoyed at not being told anything and just being batted around like a pawn in your game! I want somebody to tell me what's going (moaning). Oh, that felt so good. - Calmly, Bart. You must be calm. You deserve to know if you're the hero we seek. (explosion booming) (kung-fu yelling) What in the name of the Buddha is this shit?! (door whirring) (emergency alarm blaring) - We meet again, Dynastud. For the last time. - Hightower. - I'm here because you stole away my daughter's husband. - Bart, you're married? - Not on purpose. - Okay. - Say goodbye to your perverted ways, Dynastud. (lasers blasting) Well? - I kinda wanna watch football? And play video games with my brahs. - It worked! Dynastud is straight! - Dynastud, straight?! - What have you done with him, you fiends! - Whoa, everyone, just chill! - Now, with Dynastud straight, we can blast Bart and get him out of here and safely brainwashed and back to Patty. I've turned you straight, Dynastud. Now, you're going to scratch your balls in public and not even care! You're not going to notice other people's feelings, especially women. You're going to shit and not flush. And never do the dishes, and think to yourself, "Why are there no clean dishes?" What do you think of that? - I think you're a fucking idiot. - Oh yeah? Why? - Because you just turned me straight. You didn't turn me to your side, you didn't take away my superpowers. If anything, you amplified them with undo aggression. - What are you doing?! - 100 billion gallons. - All pointed at America! Dynastud! If you push that button, it will flood all of America. Everything that we hold dear will wash away in a tide of maple. Everything! A class system nobody questions! Empty strip malls and Starbucks on every corner, the biggest perpetual war machine in the world. Come on, Dynastud. What do ya say? (eerie music) - Fuck it. I want pancakes. (alarm blaring) (maple syrup splashing) (screaming) - Ooh, I'm terribly sorry to have to tell you about this, but everyone in America's dead now, eh? (eerie music) - Fuck it all. (electronic bleeping) One last dance. But first, I'm gonna send this little faggot to the grave. (intense music) - No! (gun shots booming) (whooshing) - Gun-fu! (kung-fu shouting) (sharply exhaling) What are you doing? - Making America great again. - Wait! I'll give ya anything you need. Come to my side. - I'm gonna freeze your nomination. (ominous music) (door clanking) - Fuck your mother, Dynastud! - That's mothers! Motherfucker! (electronic bleeping) Hey, I'm very sorry about your dad. - No, don't sweat it. He was a total douche canoe. Anyway, I'm gonna head out. - So, remember the prophecy? Are we gonna fuck now or what? - Ooh, on second thought, I am going to stay. - I can't. My Gaydar, gone! Instead in my head, a blueprint of raping and pillaging. Come on, wake up, let's do this! I'm on top! (moaning) - Oh, you're so rough! And why the fuck do you suddenly smell like a bottle of Old Spice? - I don't know. Come on, let's do this! This never happens! - What do we do?! How do we make you gay again?! (funky music) - I can't do this. It has to be you, Bart. The prophecies must've meant him all along! - What do you mean? - You've gotta Bruce Li, Bart. Bart, I never understood your pacifist nature. But now it all makes sense. You see, Bart, you're a lover, not a fighter. - The world ain't gonna unfuck itself, Bart. (light funky music) - Stand back, world! Bart's about to enter the dragon! - Okay, before we do this, can I know something about you? - Well, I'm really into feet. - Yup, okay, we can stop there. (electronic bleeping) (moaning) (spitting) (groaning and moaning) - It's working! It's working! - What the hell is that? - That's a rip forming in the space time continuum! - Are you serious?! (whooshing) - Uh, Bart, Bruce, you're gonna have to work a little harder at this, or else the vortex will collapse on itself. - I'm doing the best I can here! - Yeah, he's good, but he's not Dyna-good. - Thanks a lot! - Dynastud, you'll have to join us! It's the only way! - I can't, I'm no longer gay! Besides, all I wanna do is listen to country western music and hunt small animals. - All will be lost if you don't join us! (whooshing) - Well, are you gonna save the world or not? - I want to, but I'm straight now. - Dynastud! You lovely fool! Don't you know, it's not gay if a girl is watching! - Holy shit! Yeah, you're right, why didn't I think of that?! - Oh, and if you don't hold their head when they're blowing you. - Okay, yeah, I get it. - And if the balls don't touch. - Alright, yeah, moving right along. (exhaling) (upbeat rock music) (belt whipping) (slapping) (moaning) - [Together] It is accomplished! (shouting) - A portal through time. Do you know what this means, Bart? - Actually, no. I don't know what this means. Where are we going to go? And when we get there, what are we going to do? - For so long, our future was uncertain. But no longer. With this portal, we have the ability to go to those moments in history where our enemies sow the seeds of hate. And in their place, offer love. We will fight our enemies across time itself to prove our love is valid. We will rewrite history, so that it celebrates all and not just a privileged few. We will travel through time to ensure that humanity's legacy isn't a dark cloud, but a rainbow. (triumphant music) We're going to the past to ensure that ignorance stays there. This is our purpose. This is our mission. This is just the beginning. (light music) - But first, we can have a six-way with ourselves, right? - Damn right. Then we can go save history. - Well, then. Let's do this. - I call dibs on me!

Don't give me that! I'm disappointed in you, all of you! Even the ones who didn't vote for the last asshole, and especially those of you who decided you had moral objections to pulling the lever for the last asshole's opponent. Your high and mighty convictions helped put that asshole in the White House. And look what that got you! Gave the slimy underbelly of this nation a wonderful opportunity to crawl out of their holes and be openly awful. You know better. I know you know better. And as for those of you who did vote for the asshole, you need to get that shit out of your system right the hell now! There's no room for your hate and intolerance and fear. Not in America! Not on the goddamn planet! Don't be awful! You got a couple of fellas livin' next door to you, you don't like what they get up to in their bedroom? Get on with your own damn life. If it makes you uncomfortable, it's because you're payin' too much attention. Stop peepin' in other people's windows! Literally and figuratively. Those two fellas, what damn bit of difference does it make to your day-to-day life if they're living together next door to you or if they're married and living next door to you. We're all just trying to live our lives. All of us, gay, straight, black, white, whatever the hell. We're all just trying to find a little bit of love, a little bit of happiness. Don't be awful. I swear, it's like none of ya have the damn sense ya mommas worked so hard to beat into ya! We've all gotta live under this one roof. And that means we sure as hell better learn to get along. You want the space force to shoot the people you don't like into the sun? And what happens when the tide turns, and suddenly, you're the people that people don't like? Don't be awful. That's all it takes. And that's all I'm gonna say to you. You'd best not make me say it again. (light music)
