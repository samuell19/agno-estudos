If I had just listened to you, maybe things would have been different. But I just had to pursue my dreams. If I hadn't clicked on that goddamn reply button. Hey, open up. What did we just talk about the other night? Do you want me to start punishing you? I don't know why you won't listen. Is it too much to ask? Fine, we'll talk about it in the morning. Dinner's in the fridge. How could you be so fucking stupid! What the actual fuck is wrong with you? If you just had a gun, stupid fucking guns. What fucking happened? We, uh, we like what we saw. It was a very impressive monologue. Do you have any head shots or anything? If so, would it be possible to meet up in person for an audition? I couldn't just send him a friend request, I had to use my brain a bit. Ring-a-ding-ding, you billed the king. - Hey, Jason. - Hey. - I can't work today. - Wait, what? What do you mean? We're swamped here, come on. - I can't work today. - Violet. I'm sorry. Hey, do you have work today? No, it's my day off. - Where were you last night? - Out. Were you at that lake again? You sure do like going there a lot. It's peaceful. I don't mind you going there. It's just late at night. I just want you home, it's not safe, okay? Not safe? Yeah, you don't know what kinda sickos there are in this world. The world is very rough, people are very messed up. I'm serious, young lady. - So, how 'bout that audition? - What? You begged me about the audition, and now you act like you don't even remember? I'm still waking up. My mind isn't functioning yet. Well, if you decide to do it, it just has to be on a weekend so I can go with you. Okay, I'll let you know. So, what are your plans for the day? I don't know. I have a hunch, you're probably gonna go back to the lake, - right? - Possibly. Well, if you do, please come home before it gets dark, that's all I ask, okay? - All right, love you, kiddo. - I love you, too. It took a couple of days, But he finally let me in. Meet up, huh? After a couple of messages? How do I know you're real and not someone catfishing me? Is that enough proof for you? Yeah, we can meet up in about a week or so when my wife's outta town. If you're a real bad girl, you won't care that I'm married. Sounds good to me, XOXO. I don't know why, but I just had to go back to that house. I couldn't get it off my mind. No! - Hi! - Come on in. So what were you thinking of- Whew. The fuck is it? Where is it? - Help! - Shh, shh, shh, uh-uh. Let's try this again. Okay, where the fuck is it? That's better, shh. Good boy. Where is the memory card for the video? It's gone, I swear! What do you mean, it's gone? I delete all my footage after I put it on my laptop. I swear to God. Those guys wanted to kill you, and I said no. I'm sorry. Please. I'm sorry. Please. I'm sorry, you gotta believe me. I told them. What are you doing? Shut the fuck up! What the fuck are you doing? I said shut up. What did I do? I wasn't the one. You all were equally as responsible. Don't you fucking even start! I don't care if you weren't the one that penetrated me. You planned the event. You recorded it! You're just as fucking guilty. What's your pin, what is it? Come on, what is it? Do you want me to pluck your fucking eye out next? What is your fucking pin? 5154. Thank you. This website was the definition of depravity. If I wasn't so desensitized, I'd probably be nauseous by now. The sad part was I couldn't look away. This was my only source to get what I wanted! So I had to make an account of my own. Hey, are you okay? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Are you all right? Yeah, are you okay? I'm fine. Do you need to talk to me about something? No, I'm just stressed, that's all. - What's on your mind? - Really? Yeah, I wouldn't have asked if I didn't wanna know. All right, my parents. Is it bad? I mean, for me, yeah, it's bad. My parents think I'm in college for right now, and in fact I am here. Do you have like a job or something to help you out with that? I have a job, a little donation center I work for, but I don't get a lot of hours, so when I'm not here, I'm here. And when I'm not here, I'm at home lying to my parents. You know, I bet if you talked to your parents, they'd be okay with it. No. I mean, my mom might, but my dad would literally kill me. He's one of those follow in his footsteps kinda guy. It's a good job, it's good money, but it's not what I wanna do. There's definitely more to life than a paycheck. Yeah, I wondered why you came here. Sorry, I know this is gonna seem really awkward, but I've seen you for a while across the lake. I think we're way past awkward at this point. But I guess if we're being honest, I've noticed you for a while, too. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. How long you been coming here? Ever since my grandmother passed, let's just say it's been a long time. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. It's not your fault. It happened back in early March, and all the people I thought were really my friends didn't even bother to come to the funeral. The only people that went were me, my mom, and my aunt. God, I was such a mess. What made it harder, my grandmother lived with me ever since I was little. This beanie is actually the only thing I have left of her. - Nobody was there for you? - Nope. About the only thing I got from people were texts saying I'm sorry, after the fact. What was even worse was that the people I thought were ones really close to me, once they saw how much of a mess I was, they wanted nothing to do with me. Just shut me out or ignored me. I guess they just wanted to see me back to my happy self, but you know what? It doesn't work like that. If you can't be there for me when I'm down and need someone the most, you shouldn't even be there at all. - I'm really sorry. - It's okay. You know what, this is kinda funny, I don't even know your name. - Josh. - Josh. I'm Violet. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. Do you do this often, where you just- - Talk to strangers in the woods? Not really, not really. - About their life? - Yeah. That was a lot, that was a big cheer. Sorry, that got a little personal. Hey, do you work today? Yeah, I've got an early shift today. Where were you last night? Out for a walk. I'm guessing Lake Katherine again? And if I did? I just don't want you there so late, it's not safe. It's the safest place that I know. Come on, that is not true. People loved the video. This video was brutal as fuck, instantly subscribed, can't wait for more, dude, you have a sick mind, and I like it! Hey, Mr. Black Darkness 666, I noticed you enjoyed my first video. I appreciate your comment. I have been a fan of your videos for quite a while. It would be killer to do like a collab sometime in the future. Hook, line, sinker. Hey, where have you been? What are you doing? I made a new friend. I just had to, you know, take some time and go figure some things out. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Did you talk to your parents yet? Oh, I have not. I haven't really found the courage to go talk to them, you know? I mean, that's understandable, I get it. Hmm, one of these days. Well, one of these days, you're gonna go home and your parents are gonna see that there's not a diploma in your hand. Well, that'll be a grand old adventure with my family then, huh? Speaking of adventures, you wanna go on an adventure with me? Sure, let me let this guy go real quick. Put your friend, put your friend away. All right, by buddy. - Come on, come on, come on. - Hey, wait for me! - Come on, slowpoke. - Where are we going? Ah, just be patient, my child, be patient. Come on, hey, get back here! Come on! Come to my throne, my queen. - Oh my god. - Which way? You wanna come around, you coming up? You're gonna do it the hard way? - I guess. - All right. Well, I can't help you here, honestly. I don't think it's safe. There it is. See, what'd you think? I've always heard about this thing, but I've never actually seen it in person. That's because you're not the adventurer that I am. - So. - So. That journal of yours. - Oh, no. - Whatcha write in it? No. I don't know, just stories, just get things off my mind, you know. Take all of this and put it on the paper. So, just stories or poems or like whatever? I tried to write like fictional stories before, but I just can't really focus, so it's mostly, you know, poetry, and short, sweet, to the point. Every time I write on paper, my emotions just run away on the page. - That ever happen to you? - Oh, god, yeah. Yeah, but I don't know, it's kinda the best way to write, isn't it, just kinda gives the words meaning. - So can- - Mm-mm, no. - Come one. - No. - Let me read one, please? - Really? - Yes. - No. - It depends. - On what? The fact that you won't judge me, call me names. - I promise. - Run for your life? I'm not gonna run for my life. - Screaming? - No, come on. Okay. - Read that one. - Okay. Oh, I can't look. I'm looking. Sometimes I wonder if I took control of someone else's body, and I'm just laying low so nobody notices that the real Josh isn't here anymore. I try to blend in with this dysfunctional society the best that I can, but I can't help but stare down at these puny hands, these fingernails bleeding and calluses forming, wondering if I did this with my nervous self-consciousness or if it's just how this body functions. You have a really beautiful way with words. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You aren't just saying that? - I'm not saying. - Okay. - What? I showed you mine, now you show me yours. Fine. That'll work, too. Okay, what am I in for here? - Should I be afraid? - No. Oh my god! Oh, wow. - These are awesome. - Thank you. - Is this what you do here? - Mm-hmm. I come here and sometimes I draw the lake or the trees, and pretty much nature in general. Other times, I like to draw people and what they're doing. I don't know, I guess I just have this fascination with human behavior. The people you see aren't actually who they are inside. People act different in public. Yeah, it's weird. People wear these masks and hide their true identity, and sometimes if you pay close attention, you begin to see their mask slip up, and then you get a sense of who they really are. This your house? No, I don't wanna talk about that. Okay. - Sorry. - That's all right. If you ever feel like talking about it, I'll listen. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, I think I swallowed a bug. - Are you okay? - I did swallow a bug. - Look at it. - Oh, no! - That's so little. - Oh, that's so gross. I don't like adventuring anymore. So much for being the king of your castle, huh? Well, get off my throne. All right, yes, sir, I am gone. Don't get splinters on your ass on your way down. - I hope I do. - You harlot! - Come on. - All right. It was my poetry, wasn't it? Maybe, I won't tell you. Hey, okay, so this is gonna sound really weird, but is there any chance you could maybe go around the back and climb the ladder to the second story window? What? If my mom sees you, she's not gonna let us be alone together, and she might be just a little bit overprotective of me. - You did say ladder, right? - Yeah. - You're serious. - Yes. You want me to go climb a ladder? It'll be okay, I promise, and I'll get up there really fast, and you'll be just fine. Okay, should I be afraid? - No, but- - I'm a little afraid. Shh, just be quiet. What am I doing? Really? All right, well, this is how I die. Shh, shh. I'm gonna get shot, I'm gonna get shot. Her mom's gonna come out and shoot me. - Hey. - Hey. I made dinner, you want some? Uh, no, I'm not really hungry right now, thanks though. Can you sit down here with me for a minute? Uh, yeah, what's up? I just wanna talk, I'm a little worried about you. How come? The last couple of weeks, you've been acting like a little different, like you're a different person. I just want you to know you can talk to me about anything. I know. Is it okay if I go to my room now? - Yeah, go ahead. - All right, thanks, mom. - Sorry. - Wow. What took you so long? My mom wanted to talk to me. All right, spot me. - Got it? - I don't know. I've never done this before. Oh, neither have I. Watch your legs. - You okay? - Wow. I just climbed a ladder in your backyard. You did a good job though. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You're not gonna murder me, are you? Maybe, come on. I accept that answer. - Come here. - Thank you. Do I have to be quiet? No, you're fine, she can't hear you. Is she old, is she deaf? No way. - But, ta da! - All right. Is this your artwork? Uh, yeah, actually most of it is, but some of it's actually some of my friends. - It's beautiful. - Thank you. That one might be my favorite. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Is that you? - Do you wanna watch a movie? Could I look at this a little longer? - No. - No? - Come on. - Movie, it is. Blue-ray, streaming, what are we doing? Um, I stream sometimes, but I actually prefer physical media. You can't really trust sites like Netflix because they're always taking down movies. And there's also no connecting issues with a disc, so it works out better. No, I hate that, like when you're watching something and it just stops right in the middle. It takes you completely out of it. Exactly, that's why I have the collection. Mm-hmm, you are really into horror movies. Yeah, do you like horror? Yeah, but I have never met anybody that is this much into horror movies. Well, I mean, I collect DVDs of things that I enjoy. - Like "Fangboner?" - Yeah, see, I told you. - "Fangboner." - Just pick one. - I choose you, "Fangboner." - Well, come on, put it in. All right, I'm inserting the "Fangboner." - Yes. - Yes. You're gonna put in the "Fangboner." I'm inserting the "Fangboner" now. Oh my god, just put the disc in. What am I watching right now? - Psst. - Hmm? - What's up? - Sorry. I used to watch these movies all the time, and I would just dream that I'd be in one of them one of these days. - Really? - Yeah. - What changed? - Everything. - Everything changed. - Oh, come on. It was just a dream. - You know, a stupid dream. - It's not stupid. It's your dream, nobody can tell you otherwise. What do we do? We just kinda mope around in this world, working paycheck-to-paycheck anyways, just kinda waiting for the weekend to find some sort of freedom or something. It's your dream, you shouldn't push it away. You should pursue it. Sometimes when you fall, you gotta get back up. New breed, highly aggressive and larger than any other modern arachnid. - Hey? - Hmm? - I'll be right back. - Okay. Who makes this shit? - What? - Oh, this is weird. Like good weird or bad weird? Hmm, yes, yep. - Just yes. - Yes. That is my answer and I'm- If you finish it, it's gonna be a lot better. Okay, I'll finish it. Promise, you're gonna like it. I'm in it to win it now. And have nightmares. Hey, so, thanks for coming over tonight. It was nice to have a friend. It's no problem. - I had a good time. - Good. So we'll do it again soon? I'd like that. Can I use the front door next time? Yeah, I'll let you use it next time. Thanks. Hey, just don't make a lotta noise - going down there, please. - Really? - I don't wanna wake her up. - Okay. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. - Have a good night. - You, too. Hey, are you that Darkness guy 666? We talked online. - Yeah, come on in. - Cool. You got a nice place here. Do you really think I'm that fucking stupid? Drop the bag, now! Kick it over here. Let's see what you got? Looks like somebody wasn't coming over here to play very friendly now, were you? All right, this is what we're going to do. You are going to open up that door and go into the basement. I'm not going to tell you twice. Come on. Fuck! Fucking little bitch! You're not as smart as you think. You fell for my bait way too easy! It's pathetic. Once I saw the video and realized who it was, I knew you were sniffing us out. I was the one who suggested we put you down. But no, we had to let you live. I think that's pretty fucking stupid, don't you? I'm sure the deceased would agree with me right now if he could. You are one stupid little girl. But on the contrary, you are one hell of a good time. My initial plan was just to dispose of your body, get rid of the evidence, that'd be the end of you. However, now that I have you here, maybe we can have a little fun of our own. Shut your fucking mouth. Shut your fucking mouth! Bitches break. Josh, could you get the camera? You got something to say? Fucking cunt. Turn the camera on and start recording. Should have fucking killed you when we had the chance. You should have! Now I'm only gonna say this once, so please, please pay close attention. Where's your friend, the one who helped you with your collaboration, user name Cabal? You think this is funny? Fucking pussy. He was supposed to be here with me right now to take care of you, but at the last minute, he bitched out. Guess he didn't wanna ruin the life he built for himself. Are you gonna answer my question or not? If you think I'm going to just rat him out, you are wasting your time, little girl. I guess I am. Fucking cunt. So about that name, is it worth risking your dick over? Isn't that like your only sense of pleasure? I know with a potty mouth like yours, you don't talk to girls that much. Fucking cunt. Tick-tock, tick-tock. You don't understand, you will never find him. He's more of a viewer. Not that I remember. Because that was his first and only time on camera. And how do you know that? I was the one who insisted he come with. Tick tock, time's up. You know you're a lot stronger than you look. Maybe if you took some self-defense classes, you wouldn't have gotten taken advantage of. Self-defense, that's funny. You know, maybe if men had something called self-control, maybe things would have been different. You're right, you know. Right about what? You should have killed me when you had the chance. Turn the camera on. You can stop, okay, now. Why the star? The star is a metaphor. It represents people, how we cannot see them from afar, but as they get closer in our lives, we can see them for who they really are. Let's clean up and get outta here. How did you know where I was today? I looked at your laptop. I accidentally saw the email. I was worried, so I followed you. Thank you. I'm sorry. You're not mad, are you? You saved me. I was stupid. If you hadn't been there, I don't know what- - Shh, you're okay. You're okay, it's all right. I don't know what the answer is, I don't know if this is the right thing to do, you've been through a lot, so whatever you decide, I'll be there. There's just one more, one more, and then I'm done, I promise. A few weeks passed. The second video became even more popular than the first one, with over 60,000 views in the first night, and thousands of comments enjoying the footage. I became pretty popular. I, of course, edited the footage not to show my face and I bleeped out names being spoken to hide our identities. The audience didn't care about any of that. They just loved the brutality of the content. I even tagged Mr. Black Darkness 666's account in the video. So you've had the beard for a while now. Did you ever think about shaving it and just leaving the mustache? Mm, I don't think so, no. Or like shaving but leaving sideburns? - Sideburns? - Yeah. Or just like a handlebar mustache. I mean, the beard, it's like a magnet, you know? It just attracts women and some men. But like the other night, this guy came up to me at the gym, and he had the biggest handlebar mustache - I've ever seen. - Really? Okay, all right, so I wanted to tell you this, I was just last night with a couple of friends who were filming, making this short film, and we were just working for hours, man, just hours and hours, making the scene over and over again. We wanted to make it perfect, you know? Oh, you know what? It's been 15 minutes. Yeah, you should probably go. Jason's probably waiting for you to get back to work. All right then, see you out there. - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, sorry. It's just I know we don't talk that much, but I notice you've been acting a little strange lately. I've just been going through some things. - I've been there. - Really? I'm sorry, you just seem perfect in every way. You're always talking to people and smiling, laughing. Trust me, it took a while to be able to fix my wounds. And just recently I was able to piece myself back together and leave the past in the past, you know? How do you even know where to start? Honestly, it all started when I met this guy. He was really sweet, and just having a friend around really helped lift my spirits. Do you still talk to him? No, but I'll never forget what he did for me. I mean, maybe one day we'll be friends again, but who knows? But, hey, I gotta get back to work. - I'll talk to you later, okay? - Yeah. Hey, thank you. It's no problem. Every night I check the site and like every night I got the same result. This man became inactive on the website. He just stopped logging in. I was beginning to lose my drive to keep chasing him. I had no other source of information to pursue. I kept asking myself if I should just give up and move on. A part of me didn't want to, but another part of me just wanted to have a normal life again. Hey, when are your parents expecting you back from college? Oh, uh, about an hour and a half. - Why? - I just wanna know - how much more time we have. - Awe. Inspiration just hit? I mean, not at this exact moment, but yes, inspiration. This is for you. I wrote it last night. As you rest your sleepy head upon my shoulder, my heart skips a beat, my body feels like a boulder, afraid to move and ruin the moment between the two of us. I hear your breath, I feel your body. Your index finger gently pokes into my arm, tearing apart my skin, into my soul. In that moment, that special heart-thudding moment, two become one. - You wrote this for me? - Yeah. Is that too much? I'm sorry, I- - You're one of the good ones. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hmm? You wanna come to dinner tonight? Are you sure? I don't wanna be a burden. I mean, mom makes too much food anyway, so it'll be fine. - Well, yeah, I'd love that. - Great. It's a date with my family. I did not think that through really. It's okay. Well, you say that until you get there. - Hmm, I think I'll live. - Okay. An hour and 15 minutes now. Hey, you're home early. Yeah, but I'm actually not gonna be home that long. Oh, yeah, are you going out? Yeah, I'm going to a friend's house. Is it Scarlet's? No, his name's Josh. I met him a few months ago. He's really nice. Well, this is the first I'm hearing about him. Well, yeah, I don't share my personal life with you, that's why. I don't even know most of your friends. Well, we're not talking about me here, we're talking about you, and you know most of my friends, I don't have that many of them. I'm gonna go change, is that okay? How long are you gonna be? I don't know, I'm just going over for dinner. I just worry about you. Mom, I'm almost 22 years old. I'm old enough to make my own decisions. But not old enough to start paying bills. Do we really have to do this right now? You're the one that wanted to be a grownup, I'm just saying.

I don't think I've ever seen you without your red beanie. I decided to leave it home tonight. This is not a fancy dinner. - You ready? - Yeah. All right, so listen, I know you're used to ladders on the second floor. I said I was sorry. We're gonna go through the front door. - Okay? - Okay. - All right, you ready? - Yes. - I am not. - It'll be fine. Hold my hand. - Hold it. - Come on. I never told you my parents were religious, did I? I'm sorry about the wait. He should be here in a few minutes. Oh, it's okay, really it is. Hey, so I didn't catch your name. Oh, I'm Violet, it's nice to meet you. Oh, it's a pleasure. Josh has told me so many nice things about you. - Mom. - Well, it's true. I'm glad. Josh is really sweet. Oh, that must be him. I'm really sorry about this. It's okay, really. - Yeah? - Yes. - You sure? - I'm sure. Sorry, if I had known we were having company. I would have gotten outta work a little earlier. Oh, it's okay, we haven't been waiting too long. Dinner just came out of the oven. - Oh, smells delicious. - Thanks. Hey, Ethan, this is Violet, Josh's friend. Oh, nice of you to join us. It's good to be here. - Who wants to say grace? - I'll do it. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts for which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen. - Amen. - Amen. All right, let's dig in. I'd love to have some, thank you. So Josh, how's school? It was good, just a lotta work. No one ever said college was gonna be easy. So how did you two meet? Oh, we're in the same class together. Well, isn't that something? Uh, maybe let's not talk about school anymore. You kids are probably getting tired of hearing that word - over and over. - Yes, please. Thank you. So what do you two do for jobs? I work at the hospital with disabled kids, and Josh's dad, he works at the school. Oh, is he a teacher? No, no, I'm a counselor. I listen to students' problems and I help them through tough times. I thought you were a real estate agent. At least, that's what Josh told me. Yeah, I used to be, but I made enough money and I decided I wanted to start helping people. I bought the car, the house, I even have a beautiful family. So, I decided I had everything that I needed. How is it? What's that, being a counselor? - Hm-mm. - It's okay. Does it ever become difficult or too much? Sometimes, but not usually. That was some dainty cut. You look really familiar. You probably saw me on campus. Yeah, it's a possibility. All right, did you catch the Bears' game and the Dolphins? Dolphins won. No, I didn't, what happened? Dolphins got 'em in overtime. No shit, oh god, thank God I'm not a Bears' fan, 'cause I tell you what, on Monday I'm gonna be rubbing it in the guys' faces. No, no, no, no, please, please, no, please, please. - Hold her down. - I got her. So that wasn't awkward at all. It was okay. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I had a good time, I really did. Okay. Sorry about my mom. Don't be, it was fine. Goodnight, Josh. Fuck! I felt like shit. After all this time, I finally found him. And now, I had no idea what to do. I'm not even gonna beg for you to spare my life. I don't even deserve to live. What we did to you was cruel, what I did to you. You got any last words? You know what's funny? After 20 years of living a normal life, being a father, having a family, part of me got bored with that. Part of me missed the old days. I'm not even a good person. Not even in the slightest. That night in the basement, I saw something in myself, something lurking deep inside, and you know what? It really scared the fuck outta me. You're lucky, this could have been much, much worse. I knew what I did was bad, I just, I couldn't help myself. After everything, getting my revenge, it, it just didn't feel like it was enough. I was still hurting on the inside. What those people did to me. They scarred me and I don't know if I'll ever get better. I wish things were different. Is there something on your mind? You tell me. I've really been thinking about it, especially with everything that's happened in the last few months, and I just can't put my finger on it. Ever since that night that you asked me to do the audition, and I said no, that it wasn't safe, it's you're like a whole different person. I don't even recognize you. People change. - Am I a bad mom? - What? Am I a bad mom for not letting you go, for saying no? - Mom. - I just... Maybe if I had not been so protective, maybe if I would have just let you follow your dreams, it would have opened all these doors for you. Instead, I just slammed it shut. I just... I'm just so scared, I'm just so scared I'm gonna lose you. You are my baby girl. I am always going to be your little girl, mom. I just don't want you mad at me anymore. I don't want you to have ill feelings towards me. I just want my daughter back. Hey, I've been looking for you. Are you all right? Look, if there's something you need to talk about, I'm right here for you. Josh- Stop. - Just stop. - What did I do? What did you do? What did you do, Violet? It was my dad. How am I suppose to explain this to my mom, hmm? How did you know? I did a little digging and found that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what my dad did to you, and I'm so sorry. I understand why you did what you did, but it's still my dad. What am I supposed to do here, Violet? How do I do this? Sorry, I didn't mean to! Josh, I love- No, no, mmmm, mm-mm. No, see, you don't get to say that anymore. You can have the lake. I fucked up. The one person I truly cared about, the one person who made me believe that things could get better, is now gone. I feel empty inside. I feel like I personally ripped my own heart out of my chest and shattered it into tiny little pieces. If I hadn't listened to that other voice in my head pulling my strings, maybe things would have been different. If I just hadn't gone to that fucking house. - Hi. - Hey, are you Violet? - Yes, sir. - Well, come on in. My name's Paul. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So is this your place? Where is everything? Uh, yeah, a buddy of mine works in real estate, so I'm able to get locations pretty much anywhere I go. It's a hell of a lot cheaper than renting out a place with someone, that's for sure. And like with any film, you don't really have too much to work with, so you gotta kinda work with what you got. But do you wanna follow me down to the basement, 'cause the camera's set up - and everything's ready to go? - Okay. I keep thinking about what Josh told me, about how revenge wouldn't solve anything. It wouldn't make things any better. And he was right. Even after I did what I thought was the right thing to do, I thought I would feel better about myself. But instead, I feel even worse. I didn't just lose Josh, I lost a part of myself and I don't think I'm ever going to return. Okay, yeah, I'm just getting more and more worried about her. She's missing so many days, she's not turning up. She's not answering my calls. I just don't know what's gotten into her lately. Yeah, this is the first I'm hearing about this. I had no idea. I know, she's usually very punctual. She's never missed a shift until recently, and I don't know what's going on in her head. She's just not turning up and not calling back, and that doesn't make me look good. It's gonna come down to a decision sooner or later as to whether we can keep her on or not. Yeah, I'm gonna have a talk with her. Thank you so much for calling, I appreciate it. - Thank you, goodbye. - Bye. Violet! Violet! Hey, I know you're in there. Oh my god. Violet, come on, wake up, wake up! Violet, oh my god. Oh my god. Hi, yes, 911? I think my daughter's overdosed. 1330 West Boulevard. Please, please, come soon, please, please. Violet, please wake up, Violet, please wake up, Violet. Please, please, Violet, please. Where am I? You're at the hospital, Vi. I thought we were gonna lose you. I thought you always hated flowers, thought they were too tacky. A boy came and dropped those off for you. He said you guys are really close. I am so sorry.
