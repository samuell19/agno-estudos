That's my sixth husband right there. The best of them. Tonya's my fifth child from husband number four. She was always a handful. And I guess we spoiled her, which is a goddamn hat trick when you haven't got shit your entire life. Still, drove her to competitions, practices. Sewed her all her costumes, but to her, her mother's a monster. Generally people either love Tonya or are not big fans, just like people either love America or they're not big fans. Tonya was totally American. You know, originally, Jeff and Tonya, uh, wanted to take out Nancy Kerrigan. Take her out. And--and I was the one who popped up and said, "There are other ways to disable people." So you're welcome. Well, I was a reporter for "Hard Copy," a pretty crappy show that the legitimate news outlets looked down on and then became. Ha ha! Well, uh, I mean, at 27, I was the most hated man in America, maybe the world, um, with a mustache I still can't apologize enough for. My name was a verb. Like, if you bashed someone in the kneecap, you, uh, you Gillooly them. That was--that was cool, though. What's people's impression of me? Um... That I'm a real person. You know, I--I never apologized for growing up poor or being a redneck, which is what I am. Um, you know, in a sport where the friggin' judges want you to be this old-timey version of what a woman's supposed to be. For being the first U.S. woman to land a triple axel.

Mommy, please! Stop it. What? A child sometimes wants to be corrected. Answer me when I talk to you. When I felt this, I gave her criticism. Stop that. The thing about Tonya was, she skated better when she was enraged. If there was no "You can't do it" type thing, she wouldn't do it. On the ice, I was there to inspire her. Off the ice... she was a happy, well-adjusted girl. Dang! Clean shot, Tonnie. I know it. I was aiming for her eyes like you said. Otherwise I could have got her probably. No sense shooting a bunny if you shoot half the meat off her. When I'm older, I'm gonna work in an office and have a deadline. I thought you wanted to do Ice Capades. I can do both. Yesterday, Mom made me wear my skating costume to school, the red one with the tassels. Everyone made fun of me. Why'd she do that? 'Cause they were taking school pictures. She said we could use the samples for competitions. I told mom that Margie Sussman called us white trash. Mom told me... Spit in her milk. I hope you didn't do that. Not yet. Do you love her? I guess. Do you? Yeah. Like you love me? Nope. Good, Tonnie, but check out sooner. What does she need a fucking fur coat for? I don't have a fucking fur coat. Because it's not just about skating. The judges want figure skaters to be-- Yeah. Rich, prissy a-holes! Well-rounded. It's a question of fitting in. She's 12, and she lands fucking triples. She doesn't fit in. She stands out. She stands out because she looks like she chops wood every morning. She does chop wood every morning. LaVona, you want to work with me a little? 23 students I train, so I can coach Tonya full-time. Yeah. And I waitress full-time to pay for your coaching. Yes, but she's not my child. No, she's mine. And I'm not throwing my money away so she can fit in with these little shits.

You skate backward and then take off from a forward position on your left leg and then somehow... Fuckin' hurl yourself blindly 3 1/2 rotations like you're light as shit, which I'm telling you, Tonya never was. land on the opposite foot on the back outside edge of a razor thin blade. It's that extra half-rotation when you already did 3 that made us call Tonya the Charles Barkley of figure skating. It was bad ass. I don't know if I can do this, Dody.

It was like a nightmare or a frickin' curse. But I still believed-- I knew I was gonna do it. Ladies and gentlemen, from the United States of America... Tonya Harding. Tonya Harding. I would be the first and only woman to do the triple axel in the Olympics. My whole life was leading up to this one moment. Visualize the triple when you're in the lay-back. This is everything you've been working for. Yeah. I fuckin' got it, Dody. She was first in the United States in 1991. She was second in the world in 1991, third in nationals in Orlando, but she arrived late for these games and missed the opening ceremony entirely. Here is Tonya Harding. Now her opening move, a lay-back spin, is unique because you're dizzy from the spins. And her next jump, the triple axel, is the most difficult jump being performed in the ladies' event. This is so exciting! No woman has attempted and completed a triple axel in Olympic competition. Tonya Harding could make history right here. So, I'd broken off my skate blade two days before in practice, and they put it back on a little off. So, all my landings were off. All of them. I mean, that wasn't my fault. So, I come in fourth, behind Nancy. And, I mean, I was really happy with that. It was awesome. It just wasn't fucking fair. Tonya Harding of the United States wound up in fourth place, followed by Surya Bonaly, Chen Lu, and Yuka Sato. Very athletic skater. Her weakness is her artistry.

I'll deny I ever said it, honey, but you're just not the image that we want to portray. You're representing our country, for fuck's sake. We need to see a wholesome American family. And you... you just refuse to play along. I don't have a wholesome American family. Why--why can't it just be about the skating? They want a wholesome American family? Fuck you. Give me that. Well, it's not gonna be easy, but, yeah, I can pull that out of my ass. Shit. I know you don't expect me to wait on you. Nope. I don't expect a thing, Mom. Well, aren't you a little hothouse flower. Don't know if you heard, but I'm training for the Olympics. So, what do you want? Money? God, no. I just--I just wanted to see you. You're a taker. Every cent I made went to your skating, and you took it. What do you want? Jesus. Well, this was a stupid fucking idea. Um... was anything I did ever good enough for you? You were soft. At 3? I made you a fighter. You never had a chance without me. You fucked with my head. You made me think that I could skate best when my life was shit. And now my life is shit. You made that fucking real for me. I don't want that. You would've picked it in a heartbeat. You should be thanking me, not blaming me. Did you... I mean, when I was a kid, did you ever love me or anything? You think Sonja Henie's mother loved her? Poor fuckin' you. I didn't stay home making Apple Brown Bettys. No, I made you a champion, knowing you'd hate me for it. That's the sacrifice a mother makes. I wish I had a mother like me instead of nice. Nice gets you shit. I didn't like my mother either. So what? I fucking gave you a gift. You cursed me. You're a monster. Spilled milk, baby. Jeff, are you down here? Oh, Jeff. I was pretty surprised when Tonya called me. But, she said... "I don't think I can make it..." I don't think I can make it to the Olympics without you. I admit it. A part of me still thought that the sun rose and set with her. I wanted her to look at me the way that she used to. I just wanted to hold on. I figured it was just for three weeks. And the second I made the team, I was gonna dump his ass. But... Before I could think too much on that, that leads-- I mean, it's what you all came for, folks-- the fucking incident! The incident. Mmm. The incident. Hmm! The fucking incident. Everyone remembers the incident differently, and that's a fact. Some people, honest to God, remember Tonya whacking Nancy herself. Um... I never talked about how it went down, except to the FBI. The press got everything wrong. Excuse me. I'm with the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office. I'm gonna need to talk with you. Oh, goddamn it. Jeff, what did you do? I've received a death threat. From Jeff? Against you. What the fuck? What did they say, exactly? Uh, it-ahem. "If Harding skates today, she'll get a-- a bullet in the back." What the fuck? How seriously should we take this? Right? I mean, girl skaters at this level, they're always messing with each other; with the costumes, with each other's skate blades. I never knew that. Yeah. It's a thing. Well, the point is, this is a large venue, and we can't protect. ♪ Ooh, baby, baby ♪ ♪ Yeah, you got me, got me close... ♪ In the end, she's too freaked out to skate. It screwed with her head for a long, long time. And it got me thinking, which...isn't always my strength. What if I do the same thing to Nancy Kerrigan, only right before Nationals? Yeah, sort of even the playing field. Right. I wouldn't be the first guy to cheat at figure skating. A lot of the judges are corrupt. It's not exactly prim and proper. Someone did it to Tonya, lest we forget. It's...my way of saying "I love you." Interesting. Go on. No, that's it. Figure I'm gonna mail some letters to screw with her head. Whoa. You effin' greenhorn. You cannot mail letters from here. It'll be postmarked from Portland. No. What we do, see, is-- We send somebody out there. We fly them out there or maybe to Massachusetts, where she's from. Yeah. Takes the suspicion off of us, see? Right. I know a guy. Shouldn't even be saying his name. Derrick.

Nancy Kerrigan trains at Tony Kent Arena. "Nancy Kerrigan trains at Tuna Can Arena." She just said that. OK, well, who's gonna name an arena Tuna Can? Fishermen. Everyone's fishermen in Massachusetts. Just fucking call her back and ask. Hi, Vera. It's Tonya again. Mm-hmm. Our machine's a piece of crap. Could you just tell me where Nancy Kerrigan trains again? Oh, sure. Yeah, I have a stupid bet with Jeff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, Tony Kent Arena. Spell that for me, hon? O-n-y. Uh-huh. And what time? 5:45. Got it. Thanks, Vera. No problem. Yeah. Bye-bye. See you later. It's that fucking easy. Tony Kent. Thank you. Tony Kent. Tony Kent Arena. Not Tuna Can. Tony Kent Arena. It's the same fucking thing. Dinner's ready. It's bullshit. I mean, the FBI found this piece of paper in some random Dumpster, supposedly in my handwriting, with Nancy's training schedule or something on it. It was the arena Nancy skated at and her training times. I mean, what do you need training times for if all you're doing is mailing letters, right, you know? I mean, look, Jeff Gillooly can change his story all he wants to make himself feel better, but he confessed to the FBI. Guilty. I told the FBI that Tonya was in on planning it, which she was, but the plan was to mail some letters. Tonya didn't know about the assault 'cause it was never supposed to be an assault. Just letters. I gave Shawn a thousand bucks. Nothing happens. Gonna need to come up with more money. Do I have "Stupid" written across my head? All they had to do was mail letters someplace. I'm not giving them more money. But these are two of my top operatives. Derrick needs expense money... You know what? Call Derrick, and tell him we're calling the whole thing off. No. Sweetie, the death threat's off! Whatever. Whoa! You cannot call this thing off. This baby has moving parts. Balls are already being played with. That's too bad. All they had to do was mail fucking letters, Shawn. These are not the types of guys you want to double-cross. Trust me. That's your problem, and get me my thousand bucks back. They didn't do anything. Your thousand bu-- Jeff. Come on. Are...Tonya, you still want this to happen, right? I can still make this happen. I really don't care, Shawn. I clearly have bigger shit to fry. You eat shit? What? Fish to fry, not shit to fry. Shit to fry is a meal best served never. Who cares, you big, fat fuck? You can't make it happen anyway. I'm on your side, Tonya. You're not a secret agent. You're not a hit man. You're just a fat, nobody gas bag who still lives with his parents and drives a '76 Mercury, gets laughed at behind his back, and has never been laid. Just stay away from me! January 6th. Well, I had a session later that night, so... I was sleeping. I was asleep. Remember, if your mind is blank, no one can pick up your vibes. Also, they can't identify you if they don't see your eyes. Go. Mind's blank. No one can see my eyes. Ahem. The john? Hey. Hey. Which one's Kerrigan? What the fuck? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! I mean, we had no idea that something like this could be done by two of the biggest boobs in a story populated solely by boobs. Ha ha! Yeah? Jeff? Yeah. Holy shit! Tonya. They broke her knee! They broke her fucking knee! Whose knee? What? What? Are you fucking watching this? Turn on the fucking TV! It's everywhere! What are you talking about? Nancy Kerrigan! Some guy just fucking broke her fucking knee! No, no, no... Well, turn on the fucking TV. It was supposed to be letters, like-- It's not a fucking letter, Jeff! They broke her fucking knee! It was supposed to be letters, like a death threat! Jeff, I'm telling you, forget the death threats. Some guy broke her knee! ...primed to claim one of two Olympic spots on Saturday night. Why?! She was practicing for that performance this afternoon. She was just leaving the ice. Reporter Danielle Scarborough was waiting to interview her-- Aah!

We're everywhere. It is so friggin' awesome. What the hell, Shawn? What? What the fuck did you do? What did--I changed the course of history, if you've been watching. Are you insane? Nobody was supposed to get hurt. It was supposed to be psychological warfare, right? What if the psychological warfare didn't work? What if it didn't scare her? Then what? You know, all of our hard work would have been for nothing. What hard work? It was mailing fucking letters! I had to handle it, though, Jeff. I had to handle this and make sure it happened. Look, I'm Tonya's bodyguard, and now all the other skaters, maybe more athletes, are going to need a bodyguard, so the money's gonna be flowing in and we pocket the money... Shawn, you're on CNN. And I changed the course of history. ...joins us with the latest in sports. Dad, make sure it's a blank tape this time. It was a simple plan, Shawn. Why didn't you just stick to it? I did stick to the plan. This was not the plan. This was always the plan! You hear me? A guy like me, you think it's easy in my profession, having to think four steps ahead of everyone? Or did you not realize that I was the one who... I was the one who called the death threat on Tonya. What? "Two to the back"? People don't take me seriously, Jeff, but I am in control of the situations. I proved that today. This was not the-- Better think it-- Not in control! Relax. Everything is great. Yes, my parents did tape over my favorite episode of "Star Trek" to record the CNN coverage, but I'm keepin' it together. You're a fucking idiot. Oh, shit, shit. We got to get those guys outta Detroit, OK? Shane and Derrick, they're just stuck there. They don't have any money. Four steps ahead. Jeff? Jeff. Jeff-- Unbelievable. She told us today, she said, "I know there's a lot of people out there who think I'm a has-been." Well, with Lillehammer just six weeks away, now's her chance to show the country that she deserves a spot on the Olympic team. It'll be very interesting to see whether she plays this conservatively or not. She can be powerful, intimidating, and vulnerable, all at the same time. Make it to Derrick Smith and Shane Stant. The height and the speed is super different from all the other women. This is a big improvement from two years ago. ...great height and control. This is her final combination. I'm not paying you to stand around. ...she may make it to the Olympics. Oh, nicely done. Hey. I want to see her face. LaVona, come on. I want to see her fucking face at the end! ...Tonya's pained past, she's proved tonight she is still a winner. This is a great moment for Tonya. She's had everything go wrong, she's let everything go wrong, and now, all of a sudden, to pull this off and become... LaVona. Our national champion is terrific. And it looks like she has most definitely earned herself a place on the U.S. Olympic Team. Shane Stant was clueless, completely. Before the attack, he waited outside the arena in Massachusetts where he thought Nancy Kerrigan was training. Now, he moved his car every 15 minutes to avoid suspicion. ♪ Leave 'em hangin' on the li-ine... ♪ He did this for two days, and that's when he found out that Nancy was actually in Detroit. ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ I think they got your number ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ I think they got your alias ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ That you've been living under ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ But you really don't remember... ♪ Later, we found out they left a trail as big as the Cumberland Gap-- phone records, bank records.

Before this blows up, we got to get our story straight. Yeah, well, you do the talking. You're my manager. OK 'cause we have to be real careful about what we say. Well, we can't afford to make any mistakes. I've waited so long for this. Tonya, I want to be a skater like you. Really? Oh, hey, I hope you mean it. What's your name? Annie. Annie. Here you go. See you later. Hey, we play it cool. After all, we both have alibis. What? For--alibis? For Wheaties? Wheaties? What are you talking about? My endorsement. What are you talking about? The attack. 'Scuse us. We're with the FBI. It's just a formality. We are talking to everyone. Well, we don't know anything. That must make life difficult. Maybe you heard something, saw something. I mean, I was asleep, and Jeff wasn't even here. I wasn't even here. Um, I was asleep, too, in, um, Oregon, at home, which is in Portland, where I live, in Oregon. So what do you make of all this, Jeff? Well, it's a, um... it's a scary prospect what the world is coming to. How long are you in Detroit? We're actually heading to the airport right now. Why don't we give you a ride? Oh. Yeah. Thanks very much. Yeah. But first, who's Derrick? I don't know any Derricks. I know lots of Derricks. We're gonna miss our plane. Tonya, how do you feel about going to the Olympics? I'm really happy, but it won't be a true crown until I get my chance at Nancy at the Olympics. I'm telling you, I'm gonna whip her butt. Did the FBI speak to you? I mean, they talked to everybody, but, uh, they're doing a thorough investigation to try and find the man who did it. Whew! Thanks, guys, thanks. Holy shit. I'm going to the Olympics, Jeff. They were taking my picture. I mean, fuck the Skating Association. Fuck 'em. This is a cluster-fuck. Shit. It's not funny! We got to fix this. Fix what? We talked to the FBI. Everything's fine. She's right, man. We outsmarted 'em. My guys are paid and deep in cover-- Fuck! Jesus. What is your problem? You want to tell me what happened, Shawn?! Who did you talk to?! Nobody. Yeah?! Well, if you don't tell me now, then--then--then-- then we're all gonna be fucked! I didn't talk to anybody. Somebody knows something when they shouldn't know anything. I never said anything-- Then how come they know the name Derrick, Shawn?! I don't know. How can you even ask me that? I could withstand torture, and I would still never talk. They could never break me! That whole Nancy Kerrigan thing? That was my crew. We were paid 65 grand to take her out. Then my team obtains press credentials by beating up a reporter. That's what gets us inside the rink. Bam! My hit man whacks Kerrigan three times with a retractable baton. And then he shouts at her. He says... Shawn Eckhardt? No. Who is it, Shawnie? I brought you boys some nice tea. Thank you. Thank you. M-maybe some shortbread, too, Mom? What can you tell us about Tonya Harding? Mmm... I don't know a Tony Harding. Heh! Aren't you her bodyguard? Well...you didn't let me finish. Well. I--I don't-- I don't know her well. How about Nancy Kerrigan? Who? You haven't heard of Nancy Kerrigan? Oh. Yeah. I thought you said Nancy...Herring. Shawn-- Jeff did it. Jeff Gillooly did it. The fuck is going on? Nothing. Don't answer it! Fuck! Jeff Gillooly speaking. You got to pay me my money, and I got to get out of town. Who is it? They know something. Wait. Heh! What are you, um-- Just meet me, or else I'm gonna be forced to-- Shawn, calm down. Where do you want to meet? The Golden Buddha, uh, at our regular table. Just meet me at the stroke of midnight. I'm not meeting you at the fucking stroke of midnight. Th-th-that's the plan, man! And bring the fucking money. Great, great. Tell your mom I said hi. What's going on, Shawn? Nothing. Just... why don't you sit down? You want to go to that bar on, uh-- No, no, no. We're--we're fine here. Sit down. What's up, man? You OK? You're, uh...sweating an awful lot, even for you. No, I am not... OK. You know I'm not OK. They know something. Who? They...you know. I don't. The FBI...OK? The FBI. They know something is up. What's up? Just... Whoa. Oh... Oh, oh. Jeff, yeah. Jeff. Shawn. Are you trying to tell me you had something to do with the Nancy Kerrigan thing, hmm? Whoa. What the fuck, Jeff? Of course I had something-- Jeff? Don't... say another word, or I'll be forced to go to the authorities. Oh, Jeff-- I hope you hear me loud and clear, you fat fuck. But you made your bed. Now die in it. Diane's husband is a lawyer, so in the morning, we meet up at their house. It was nice. I mean, they had a living room and stuff. Hello there. Hey. Hey. Come on in. Then why don't we just turn his ugly, fat ass in? 'Cause-- Big, dumb, fucking tub of guts. It's only his word against ours. You and I got to stick together. Yeah, but, Jeff, I'm gonna lose everything. I worked my whole life for this, and I'm gonna lose it because of fucking Shawn? If it ever came down to that, I would tell them you didn't have anything to do with it. But right now, we got to get our story straight, and since they can't pin anything on us, we didn't know anything. Yeah, but we didn't know anything. Right. Oh. Look... they've arrested Shawn, and he's saying that it was all your idea, Jeff. We didn't know anything. I mean, it was supposed to be letters-- Ow. It's... it's gonna be a real shit show for us soon. Um...we got to go home. Don't grab me. Get the fuck off me. Get in the car. What part of "keeping your mouth shut" was unclear, you stupid fucking cunt? There is more to this than you're telling me, isn't there? Shut up, Tonya, I'm telling you. Jeff? Did you do it? Goddamn it. Shit! Fuck! Jeff! Fuck! What the fuck?! I mean, this is my-- this is my fucking life! This is--skating is my whole fucking life! What did you do? What did--what did you do? What did you actually-- Shut up! And then bam! Nails me right in the frickin' face. That's when I knew. And he's never admitted to me. I wouldn't care anymore anyways, but he's never admitted to me that he actually did it.

She's still working out every day, right here behind me, fully expecting she'll compete later this month at the Olympics in Norway. Police and the FBI continue looking into last week's attack on skater Nancy Kerrigan. Even as the U.S. Figure Skating Association convenes a hearing panel to consider whether there are grounds to remove Tonya Harding from the American Olympic team. Harding's former husband said Tuesday that she knew about the attack on Nancy Kerrigan from the beginning. ♪ Listen to the wind blow ♪ ♪ Down comes the night ♪ ♪ Run in the shadows ♪ ♪ Damn your love, damn your lies ♪ ♪ Break the silence... ♪ The papers all said I pled guilty, which I did. But not to planning the attack, which, it turns out, didn't really matter because once I knew about it and didn't report it and tried to cover it all up, I was guilty. Tonya's mom put out a red velvet rope in front of her house. Get your fat ass where it belongs. Told us if we wanted to take her picture, we all had to stand behind it. And we did! I made bail. I was charged with racketeering and fined $100,000... which I never paid, and...I never talked to Shawn again. I thought being famous was gonna be fun. I was...loved... for a minute. Then I was hated. Then I was just a punch line. It was like being abused all over again, only this time it was by you. All of you. You're all my attackers, too. With just four weeks to go to Lillehammer, she returned to training this week in Oregon under intense media scrutiny and pressure to withdraw from the Olympic team. Kerrigan also was back on the ice this week, striving to make it to Lillehammer. But in interviews with "Hard Copy," former Olympians and skating insiders have said the events of recent weeks could turn into major stumbling blocks for both competitors as they pursue Olympic gold-- Go away! Could you please just leave me alone for now? I'm not-- So what's new? Tonya! Tonya! Like your hair pulled back like that. You look young. I'm 23, Mom. Yeah, well... Seem to be holding up good. Fuck 'em, you know? I know. I never did like that Jeff. Mom. I'm not here to tell you I told you so. I'm not. Why are you here? What do you want? I want you to know... I don't know. I-- I'm on your side. There's a big crowd out there. A lot of people support you. You done good. I'm proud of you. All right. I'm going. Mom? Thanks. I know. Ahem. Hey, hon... did you know about the attack? Well, you can tell me. What? What are you looking for? What are you-- stop it! I... It's just a... Oh, no. I still meant everything I said. You hear me? Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out of my house! Get out! I still meant everything I said. Fuck off! Ow! Fuck that. Will you comment? No comment. No fucking comment. Hey! Hey! Out of my way! Hey! Tonya! OK, I used to have her tires flattened and her truck towed sometimes, so we can get a picture, you know? Look, this was the first time there was a 24-hour news cycle to fill. We all needed that story. This is bullshit. I shouldn't have to apologize for something I didn't do. Tonya, there's talk about not letting you skate at the Olympics at all. You need to give them this. We're hanging on by a thread here. I earned my place on the team fair and square. Taking out the competition with a retractable baton doesn't strike everyone that way. I didn't know about it! And that's exactly what you'll say. I can't fucking focus when I'm trying to skate. I keep falling in front of everyone, while Nancy gets her own private rink and someone catches her before she falls. Honey, you'll apologize, and this will all be over. OK. Do whatever it takes. I apologized for ever knowing or being associated with Jeff, which it looks like I'll never stop doing, ever. I had no prior knowledge of the planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan. I am responsible, however, for frailing to-- for failing... And when the Olympic Committee threatened to take me off the team, I filed a $10 million lawsuit against them. I mean, it was getting ugly. But do you think that CBS, who was showing the games, was gonna let this ginormous ratings fucker not happen? I mean, the whole entire world was waiting for this showdown between me and Nancy, so...I made the team... you know, and I was ready to show you all. And this is one of the nights that everybody's been talking about around the world, one of the most controversial and talked-about sports events in memory: the women's figure skating competition. World Champion Oksana Baiul in second place going into tonight's competition, Nancy Kerrigan in first place after the technical program, and Katarina Witt, a two-time gold medalist, who will be the last to skate. Right here. Have a seat. I was asked to comment on everything for "Hard Copy," and they paid a lot, which was cool. ...of America, Tonya Harding. And now the public address is announcing Tonya Harding's name. It is her turn to be on the ice right now. Tonya Harding, after the warm-up, had a problem with her laces. If she's not out here, I think they're gonna disqualify her. I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like this before. Is it gonna hold? Just give it... Did you pull it tight enough? I'm gonna try. How does that feel? It's OK, honey. It's OK. We're just gonna-- OK, OK. It's OK, honey. It's OK. Breathe, breathe. How long do we have? We have, uh, one minute. A minute? Oh, my God. Just tie it. Do you want to try it? Doesn't matter. Just...I'll just go. OK. Gonna break my ankles. You check out those edges in the beginning. You jump high, check out hard, and go for it, OK? My lace--my lace broke... It broke. I really tried to get out here on time. Please. In a situation like this, the referee, the judging panel will give her every opportunity to put out her best performance. I would think, though--no announcement has been made. They've obviously given her a set amount of time. Things like this just don't happen! Again, it's so important that the skate is tied properly. It's important that it's comfortable on your foot. Well, I think they're allowing Tonya to fix her skate. Again, this is every skater's recurring nightmare. This is something you wake up screaming about every morning. Can I just say one quick thing about Nancy Kerrigan? So, my lace breaks, which I guess is my fault, but really kinda isn't, and I go out and do the same stuff as everybody else. I didn't get the marks 'cause I didn't ever have a shot with the judges to begin with. I mean, it was a big story, but I don't need a big story. I'm the big story on my own when I skate. I did my best, and I got eighth. But Nancy, she goes out and gives a beautiful skate. I never said different. She wins a friggin' silver medal, and when they put that medal around her neck, she looked like she stepped in poo. She does. I mean, come on! How am I the poor sport in all of this?! An Olympic silver! She looks like she stepped in poo. Defendant, please rise. They postponed my trial till after the Olympics. Tonya Harding, you are hereby sentenced to three years' probation; $100,000 fine, plus $10,000 to the D.A.'s office for special costs; another $50,000 to set up a fund for the Special Olympics; 500 hours community service; a psychological evaluation; and your immediate resignation from the U.S. Figure Skating Association, banning you for life from all Figure Skating Association competitions and events. So ordered. No, I... all I did was... the hindering of prosecution. What, they-- It's already ruled. You're never... never gonna let me skate again? I can't ever sk-- I mean... I'd rather do the jail time, please. The-- Honey. They--they only got 18 months. They got--they got 18 months. I-- I'll do that! You can't... Your Honor, I don't have an education. All I know is skating. That's all I know, and I-- I am no one if I can't-- if I can't sk-- It's OK. You. I'm-- I'm not--I mean, I'm not some monster. Ms. Harding. I'm just-- I'm just trying to--I'm trying to do the best with what I know how to-- Ms. Harding. And you're giving me a--it's like you're giving me a life sentence if you do that. You can't do that. Ms. Harding, that's enough. You can't, please, because...just-- just send me to jail, and then I can still skate. I've given you-- Just send me to jail, and then I can still skate! I've given you my decision. Thank you, Your Honor. Don't lose your temper. This is the best we can get. Top Ten Questions Connie Chung Asked Tonya Harding Earlier. Here we go. Number Ten: Would you walk through the metal detector for me one more time, please? Number Nine: Do you think you could kick my ass? Number Eight: Can you help me and Maury have a baby? Well, I think that's uncalled for. Number Seven: How much do you think your pals would charge to whack Dan Rather's knees? Number Five: Do you know Amy Fisher? Number Four: When you hit Nancy in the knee, did it sort of sound like, "Chunngg"? "Chung"? Got a 2-year sentence, and did 8 months to the day.
