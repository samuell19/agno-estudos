A little. But Julina was really the one out in the fields with her dad. If you call laying in the fields and reading books farming. I helped him drive the tractors too. - I love reading. - Candy! No, no. Those are for tomorrow's wedding. Oh, it's tomorrow? Bonnielee, sit down. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank You for this food. We also thank You for bringing Leann and her daughter, Julina, into our family. We ask that You bless them that they may serve You and this family with grace, hard work, obedience and humility. In His name we pray. Amen. Amen. I know it's probably not what you're used to. No, it's lovely. Alice and I are across the street, and this house is for you younger wives. I mean, newer wives. I mean, you and Bonnielee. That sounds fine. Bonnielee? Is she the one that was just crying? Julina. No, please. We're all family now. Bonnielee's just young. She's been the newest wife for years now. It's just... It's an adjustment. Well, welcoming a new wife is hard on everyone, but a necessary sacrifice. Oh, it is no sacrifice to have you here, Sister Leann. Well, Julina's too young to remember, but when my husband took his second wife, I was devastated, but in time, I learned to love her. Where is she now? The prophet sent her to a husband in Bountiful. We may not even see her again. He separated you? The prophet speaks for God. It's not for us to doubt his decisions. I should put the children to bed. Okay. Good night. I know you don't understand this now, but someday you'll see how lucky we are. We've been saved, Julina. In this life and the next. It's not too long, right? It's perfect. Good. Hey. What do you think? You look beautiful. Where's your daddy? Joseph! No. No. It's okay. Um... My daddy went to be with God, so the prophet brought my mom and I here to be with your family. So you won't be alone? Yeah. Can I be your new big sister? I already have enough sisters. I never thought I'd get married again. Merril is an important man in this community. God must've seen you needed guidance. Well, we're both so grateful to the prophet, Alice. And thank you for this dress. It's beautiful. Joseph, wanna come show me around? Who's that? Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! What's this? How dare you guys grow so much while I'm gone! Look how big you are! And look at you! You're taller than I am! Come here. Come here. It's good to see you. Daddy! And I didn't come home empty-handed. I have something for you guys. Look at what I have. You gotta be kidding me! I'm not kidding. You ready? Now, we're gonna share, right? All right. You guys share and take turns. Have fun. Hello, young lady. I don't believe we've met. This is Julina, and she's not young. She's not? From Pine Valley. Yeah. Ervil Barlow. The prophet. Not what you were expecting? No. I guess I was expecting someone a little different. Yeah. An old grandpa with a cane... Long white beard, maybe missing some teeth. Yeah. God called me when I was young. Welcome home, Julina. Who gives this woman to her husband, Merril, in celestial matrimony? I do. I invite you to teach Leann all that you have learned in order that she may create a beautiful home. Be good neighbors. The Lord sees all. No. Go fish. Do you have a nine of spades? Do you have... Do you have ten of hearts? Hey! Hey! What? Hi. I'm Esther. I can help. It's okay. I got it. You're really pretty. Thanks. No one's ever come to live here from the outside. We were all born here, you know. Well, here I am. Is it true that your dad died in front of you? How does everybody know that? That must've been the worst thing in the whole world. It's fine. Was he really old? No, he wasn't old. Well, at least he's with God now. You know what? Um, excuse me. I think I forgot something inside. Uh, hey, let's sit together at dinner, all right? I'll save you a seat. Hello? Hey! Hey, careful! Whoa. You all right? Yeah. Sorry. I didn't know anyone... You're the new girl. I saw you in church. Yeah. The one who's from... Whose dad had a heart attack and dropped dead in front of her. Yeah, that's me. I was gonna say, "Who's from Pine Valley." Oh. You know, it's a sin to be dressed like that. Uh... Well, you know, it's a sin for you to be standing here with me alone. Well, then, I guess we're both sinners. What are you doing up here anyway? I just needed to get away from all the wedding stuff... and everyone. You were spying on me. What? No. You were. No, I wasn't. I'm pretty sure you were. That's ridiculous. You know, I've never met a spy before. Are you done? You don't have to be embarrassed about it. Good, because I'm not. You were totally spying on me. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I was, kind of. I knew it. A superspy. Well, not really, because you caught me... literally. So, does the superspy have a name? Julina. Ryder. Come on. Um, I really should go back. They won't start dinner till after sunset. Are you sure? Yeah. Trust me. ♪ You know, once people get to know you, they'll stop talking about your dad. How do you know? Because my mom died two years ago, and no one ever talks about her. Sometimes I wish they would. I'm sorry. Whoa. Look at this. Yeah. Those are all over these canyons. Supposedly they're over 10,000 years old. But the world was created 6,000 years ago. Yeah. I don't think so. That's against the priesthood. Okay. So, do you also believe that the world's gonna end in our lifetime? I don't know. I don't really think about it. Yeah? 'Cause you're not supposed to. Just supposed to accept and believe. I feel like I might not wanna be here when the prophet catches you saying things like that. Like what? Things that could get you punished. Look, I'm not saying that I don't believe in God. I just don't always believe in people. We should probably go. Back. ♪ ♪ You're not gonna join them? I will later. Where'd you run off to? We were afraid we lost you. I just went down to the canyon for a quick walk. Be careful.

Good night. Hi. Sorry to interrupt. What do you think you're doing? You can't be outside my window. Oh. Should I come in then? What if someone sees you? They won't. I... I couldn't stop thinking about you. I wanted to see you. Okay. You saw me. Now go. Okay. Go. Shh! Meet me tomorrow after Sunday prayer. I don't know. Promise, or I'll start yelling.

Has the prophet placed you yet? No. I thought you were, like, 20 or something. 17. How old are you? 13. I still have time. Okay. You can't tell me you haven't thought about it. Not just marrying someone, but actually truly falling in love with someone? It looks like you've already figured out who that someone might be. Stop talking like that. Prophet wouldn't like it. I just feel like if we marry someone in the priesthood, why can't we be with someone that we actually love? Well, that's why you have to stay sweet. So he'll place you with someone good. Not like... Like that guy? If you wanna be with your family in heaven, the prophet's gonna have to place you with a husband soon. I mean, what if you're left here alone? Then I'll finally have my own room? Ha-ha. Ryder shouldn't wear his shirt like that. It's improper. If he's not careful, he's gonna become an apostate. You don't even know what that means. Do too. It's someone who questions the prophet and turns against God, like Micah Kimball. Who's that? A boy who used to live here. Ran away about a year ago. Didn't even tell his family he was leaving. Just left in the middle of the night. Julina, don't! How can the spirit of God be here if we refuse to follow His way? The outside world is just beyond those gates... Judging us, wanting to destroy our way of life. The end of the world is very close now, brothers and sisters. Only those who obey God will be taken up with Him. I plead with you today... For your souls... To lead a clean life, a moral life, and not go the way of the gentiles who worship only television, music, money. That will be their downfall. What you love you obey. Our love is for the Lord. Be good neighbors. The Lord sees all. Hello, Sister. Bye. Julina, what in the world is wrong with you? I know, Mom. I'm really sorry. It was my fault. I'm so sorry, Sister. I was sitting behind you, and I got her hair caught in my Bible, and I think I just surprised her. Is this true? Son. So, um, it was nice seeing you ladies. Of course. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon. You didn't tell me you knew the prophet's son. Okay, one more, and then I gotta get going. All right. Okay. So two old guys... Joel and Willard... Are in Joel's living room. Joel tells him that last night, one of his wives made a fantastic dinner. Willard asked what it was, and Joel can't remember. "Some kind of spice?" Willard asked him, "Ginger?" "No, that wasn't it." "Basil?" "No, that wasn't it." "Rosemary?" "Yeah, that's it! "Rosemary, honey, what'd you make for dinner last night? It was so good." Hello there, young man. Your dad got you working hard out on those fields? Every day. Keeps him out of trouble. Well, we all gotta keep each other out of trouble. Don't we? Yes, sir. Till next time, Gene. Absolutely. Afternoon, gentlemen. Have a nice day. How are you, son? I'm fine. Good. I've had a revelation, Ryder. It concerns you. In a dream, God told me He has chosen you to be the next prophet. One day soon, you will be asked to step forward and lead and to do what's necessary to protect our way of life. I'll... I'll do my best. I know you will. "Seek the Lord while He may be found. "Call Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake"... Oh, I know he's hot, but a fever's a good sign. It means his body's just doing what it needs to do to fight infection. He's gonna be fine. Okay. How did you, uh, learn so much about babies? You mean, because I only had one? Yeah. When it became clear that God wasn't going to bless me with any more, my husband and I... My first husband and I decided I should get a nursing degree. I went to Algonquin Community. To help deliver other children? Yeah. Deliver them, care for them when they're sick. You thinking about going to school? Uh, no. Merril doesn't want women going away to college. I see. Joseph said Julina took the truck. Yeah. She offered to go to town to do the shopping. I gave her your list. Here. He's gonna be fine. Okay. Sister Alice? Sister Alice... I want you to know Julina really is a good girl. It's... Look, it's been hard, and she's... She's a troublemaker. No, no. No. It's just her father always encouraged her to have a sense of independence. That's unfortunate. As the prophet says, "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord." "As unto the Lord." I know. I know she can keep sweet. Please, just give her some time. Let me know when she gets back. ♪ Never gonna break, never gonna break ♪ ♪ Never gonna break, never gonna break ♪ ♪ Never gonna fall ♪ ♪ Carry on... ♪ Hey. I didn't think you'd come. Neither did I.

Micah the apostate? I don't know if I would call him that. Esther would. Esther did, actually. ♪ I can only imagine what Esther calls me. Why didn't you tell me that your father's the prophet? I assumed you knew. How would I have known? Well, aren't you supposed to be a superspy? So you're famous. Uh, yeah. Pretty much. What's he like? I don't know. He's leaving soon, and I am to take his place... as the prophet. That's big. Yeah. Is that what you want? It's not about what I want. It's about what he wants. You mean, what God wants. God, my dad... Since my mom and Micah, I've been thinking about things. About places I could go. So you are an apostate. Does that scare you? I don't scare easily. Will you play me something? Oh, I don't actually know how to play anything. I don't believe that. Okay. ♪ ♪ Will you dance? Oh, come on. Mm-mm. Come on. ♪ Nope. Will you dance with me? This whole thing's crazy. I know. Uh... I can't stop thinking about that kiss. But it's a sin. So let me sin again. Um... It's my mom. I... I have to go. Wait. Julina, I... No. Please, I just... I have to go. Julina? Hey, what happened? You didn't answer my call. I'm sorry. There was just so much traffic. But I got home as fast as I could. It's okay. Listen. The prophet wants to see you. Julina. Um, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. Not at all. Please, come sit. Do you have any idea why I might have called you here tonight? Um, no. Nothing's coming to mind. God sent me a revelation last night. It was about you. Okay. You were brought to Hill Creek for a reason. God wants us to be married. Congratulations. Oh, thank you. Are you so happy? Yeah. Oh, there she is. It's a blessing from God, isn't it, Alice? Yes. It's a miracle. Now we'll all be in heaven together. Not if I don't get my chores done. Oh, we need to get started on her dress. Where have you been? You can't just disappear like that. I had to think. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go talk to him. You can't. Why not? He's the prophet. I don't think we have a choice. So that's it. We just give up? No. What do we do if he says no? Figure it out. But... I don't wanna lose you, all right? What is it? I need to talk to you about something. About Julina. Yes? I, uh... Spit it out, son. Why are you marrying her? God has spoken to me. She is to be my next wife. She can't. Why not? Because I... She told me that she likes someone else. You sound like a babbling schoolgirl. No. Look, what... what I'm trying to say is that... I can't have you acting like this. The time for you to lead has come. You start next week. What? As my surrogate. Julina and I are going to build a new community. Where? In Mexico. You can't just take her. It's not me who wants this, it's God. You sure about that? I will do as God tells me. And so will you. Be very careful, Ryder. Even I cannot keep you safe from the wrath of God if He deems you unworthy. Here. I can do this. Thank you. I'm not feeling that well. You always have a hard time in your second trimester. You're pregnant again? Yeah. What happened to Ryder's mom? Anna, um... It was an accident. What was an accident? What happened? Julina? Oh, um, I need your help with the laundry. I mean, what did he say? Did he say why? No. This is crazy. I mean, he can't do this, right? Shh! The prophet has spoken. You'll do what he asks of you. You have to make him change his mind. I can't leave, Mom. It isn't as though we won't see each other again. We'll plan visits. But, Julina, this is the will of God. He's chosen you. He's chosen you to marry the prophet, to start a new life with him. I don't want a new life. I want this one. I'll finish your wedding dress, help you get your things packed. You'll leave next week. Next week? Yes. The day after your wedding. And Merril was under no obligation to tell us, but he thought I should know. Wow! How unbelievably thoughtful of him! Listen to me. If you want us to be together for eternity, you'll do as you've been told, and you'll be grateful. Yeah, well, I'm not grateful. And I won't go. Julina... Julina! I know. No, it's okay. It's okay. I'm never gonna see you again. No. I'm gonna come with you, okay? I'll convince him that he needs me, and... No, no. He's not gonna listen to you. Then we'll go into hiding. Somewhere they can't get us. We could just stay here. Yeah. Yeah, I'll fix it up, and, uh, put a pool out back. What are we gonna do? Marry me. What? I love you, Julina. That's all that matters, okay? We will... We'll get married, and we'll figure out the rest. But we'll be... Wait. If we get married outside the ch... I don't believe in a God that doesn't want us together. Marry me. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Thank you. Let us pray. I, Ryder Barlow, take you, Julina Christiansen, to be my wife. I, Julina Christiansen, take you, Ryder Barlow, to be my husband. I pledge my life to you. I promise to let nothing come between us. I'll honor you in sickness and in health. For rich or for poor. All the days of my life. All the days of my life. May I kiss the bride? You may. It's a sin. Esther, what are you doing here? Julina? Wait. Esther, wait! Shoot! Esther! She's gonna tell everyone. No, no. She wouldn't do that. Or I don't think she'd do that. Go home now and pack. We can't wait until this weekend, okay? We gotta go tomorrow. Okay. Okay, you're right. We can take the Hill Creek bus to... Wherever the 6:00 p.m. bus is going, that's where we're going. We have to make it through tomorrow. Then it's just you and me. Okay. Okay. You missed dinner. We waited for half an hour. Merril was very upset. I don't care what Merril thinks. He's not my dad. He's your priesthood father now. Where were you? With Esther. Why? Well, maybe because my whole life's about to change, and I needed to talk to someone. All you wanna talk about is that stupid dress! Shh! Look, can we just... Dad would've understood. Please, Julina, I don't want things to be like this between us. Why not? This is how it's always been between us. Julina... Look, Esther, I know that you think what you saw was wrong, but I promise you... I don't feel so well. What do you mean? Are you okay? Are you pregnant? The prophet's blessed us both now. Once he sees his baby, maybe he'll take me for his next wife. Oh! I'm gonna get my mom. No, no, no. I want it to be a surprise. Mom! Mom! It's okay. It's okay. Just... Just breathe. I'm so sorry, Julina. For what? Why... Why are you sorry, Esther? What did you do? Esther, did you say something? Mom! There's so much blood. What's that mean? Is she gonna be okay? This baby's coming. Where's her mother? She doesn't wanna come. What? She's too ashamed. Prophet... she's hemorrhaging severely. We need to get her to the hospital right away. No. She needs more help than I can give her. It's in God's hands now, Leann. You know that. If we don't take her soon, we'll lose them both. She stays here. Julina, get some hot water. I'll get some more towels. Sister Alice... The prophet's word is God's word. We need to save the child. We need to save both children. Mom, I need to tell you something. Not now. No, please. It's about the prophet. Can you think about someone other than yourself for one minute? Stay with her. I'll be right back. Am I gonna die? Um... I don't know. I don't want to. It's okay. God will take care of you... no matter what happens. What are you doing here? Just thought I'd give you a ride back. Climb in. Mom... the prophet did something really wrong. Not now, Julina, please. Mom! I've got work to do. I can't concern myself with your problems. No, this isn't about me. Go! But... Go. Okay. Okay. Mom? No, honey, I'm not. I'm not your mommy. Mommy, please... It hurts. Okay. It's okay. I'm here. Mommy's here. Okay? Where are we going? Gotta make a stop before we get home. Where? Kane. It shouldn't take too long. The baby? A girl. Find Bonnielee. She'll need to be fed. Who's the father? How far to Kane? About 20 more miles. You got somewhere to be? No, I... No. Ryder? Ryder! I thought you said it was 20 miles to Kane. Where are we? Get out of the car, son. Dad? Get out of the car. She is to be my wife, Ryder. It is what God wants. Dad, don't... don't do this. Get out! Don't do this, Dad, please. "And the great dragon was cast out, "that serpent, called the Devil, "and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world. He was cast out into the earth"... I love her. God has told me what I have to do. Dad, don't leave me here. I must. You're weak... and interfering with God's plans. Julina must give birth to a new prophet. The prophet you'll never be. Wait! Wait! Don't hurt her! Dad! We have lost one of our beloved children this day. Esther Jessop is no longer with us. Although she sinned in His presence and was with child without being under the protection of holy matrimony, we offer a prayer for her forsaken soul. Heavenly Father, help us learn our lesson from this immoral girl and the wicked boy who seduced her into sin. Though they shall never find their way to eternal life, we... We pray nonetheless for their sins and salvation. Julina! Julina, what are you doing? Julina, you need to be careful. I'm not just gonna sit in there and listen to him lie to everyone. Lie about what? About everything! About what happened to Esther! Esther and Ryder? What? It's his baby. That's what everyone's saying. That's why he left. No. Julina. Prophet wants to see you. It's clear you're upset, Julina. It's not very becoming. You know you're expected to keep sweet. What did you do to him? He said he was overcome by temptation... That the devil was getting the best of him. Yes, he did. And the next morning, he was gone. No. You're lying. Now, this isn't easy for me, Julina. Ryder's my oldest son. I look to you for comfort. Get... off of me! Stop! Julina? Julina, what happened? What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Does he want you to leave tonight, before you're married? I'm not marrying him. Okay, look. I don't understand. I'm leaving. No. Slow down. You're not making sense. I'm in love with Ryder. What? We're already married in the eyes of God. How will you be received into the celestial kingdom? Our prophet tells us that... Your prophet, not mine! I just have to go find Ryder. You're giving everything up for some boy?

Ready to go? This is not a good idea. We're going to rescue a girl from a life of torture. It sounds like a good idea to me. Micah, being back there... You don't know what it'll do to you. He'll be fine. I'll take care of him. Fine. I'm here if you need me. Good-bye. Your mother sent your wedding dress. Don't cry. I have good news. God has told me that tonight, after our wedding, you will conceive the next prophet. Please stop touching me. Don't be frightened. It will be beautiful. I promise. I'll see you tonight, my bride. ♪ I should be going with you. Hell, no. Dude, you're the most famous heretic on the goddamn face of the earth. I mean, they'll spot you in seconds. You can get on the compound after dark. Go through the canyon. You should be able to get to her fast from there. I got it. What if they've moved her? What if she's... Ryder, please, just... You're giving me a headache. You're making me dizzy. Just sit down. You're high again, aren't you? Ohh... Aren't you? Don't... Don't start. You know, Micah, I didn't even recognize you when I found you in that... whatever that was. Jesus, Ryder! What is your deal with trying to save people? Give it a rest, dude. Christ! Hey, remember that time we lit that fire and burned down half the roof? You burned down half the roof. I burned down the roof. I made out with Emily right there for the first time. Played you your first Rage album. Huh? You remember that? Do you remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Hmm? Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Uh-oh. Wait. Wait. There. Stay right there. The light's perfect. Come on. Come on. We had some good times, man. You did. I was mostly in temple getting lectured by my dad. Yeah, well, maybe that's why you turned out okay, and I turned out like me. We should call that Aaron guy when we get back. He can help you, Micah. Ryder, I already told you, man. I'm not going back to Vegas. You gonna be okay to do this? Ryder... I got you. Esther isn't the first one he's done this to. Ryder's mother, Anna, was my best friend. We shared everything. My mother used to call us "the Giggle Twins." What happened to her? I told her he was dangerous. I told her the beatings would get worse. And then she was gone. What can I do? Julina isn't married to him yet. I told you, she doesn't want to see you. I just wanna say good-bye. She's her only child. No. Please. Sisters, be very careful. You are in danger of losing favor with the Lord. Good night. I am gonna say good-bye to my daughter. Watch them. Give her a moment. No. No! No! Oh, my God! No. No! No! Oh, my God! Hey! Hey! Where is he? Where is he? I don't know what you're talking about. I just stopped by to say hello. What do you... Ohh! Okay. Now you're stealing. God wouldn't like that, Prophet. What, are you looking for a hot date? You always were a sinner, Micah. Take him to the canyon. Whoo! Mom. Oh, you're home! Mom! Micah? I told you to stay away from her. God told me she was to give me a son. A true son. What did you do to her? My beautiful Julina... killed herself! No. No. No. How... I saw you... I wanted to kill myself. Okay, shh. We're going to get you out of here. But my mom and A... No. You disobeyed God. No. Wake up, please. Heavenly Father, we pray for the prophet, Ervil Barlow, who was preparing for Your second coming in Mexico. - In Your name we pray. - Amen. Be good neighbors, for the Lord sees all. You sure you can't stay? I just don't believe anymore. Are you sure you can't come? My life is here. Hey. God saved you, Julina. No. You did. Okay. You ready? ♪ When I was a younger man ♪ ♪ I thought the pain of defeat would last forever ♪ ♪ But now I don't know ♪
