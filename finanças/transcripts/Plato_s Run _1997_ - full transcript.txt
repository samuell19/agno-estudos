But there's no way that I miss [inaudible] Just. No way I got to work him over a little bit. He doesn't know, but he's gonna be on a plane with me to Kuwait tomorrow. Oh, is that right? No I'm not. I've done that [inaudible]. [interposing voices] DOMINICK: Absolutely. Oh my god. Look at that. PLATO: Look at what? SAM: Human pastry. My favorite. Oh man, I ain't even had my dinner yet. I'll talk to you guys later. See? [inaudible] I'll tell you what this is gonna be. This is going to be a lot of trouble. Hey. [grunting] [shattering glass] [interposing voices] [grunting] [sirens] That was good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I told you you still had it in you [inaudible].. But the problem is that was for all the wrong reasons. You get it? --blah blah blah blah blah. What it's about is old friends sticking together, right? Yeah. Right [inaudible]. Look I got to get out of here. Do me a favor and take, uh, what's left of Kathy's birthday present. - Thank you, Dominick. - OK. I will. Take care. [inaudible] - Stay away from this guy. He's trouble. - I know he is. Very sweet. Very sweet. That guy never could take a joke. Come on. Let's go. Hey, hey, hey. [inaudible] Ah, shit. Someone would very much like to speak to you. Listen, man. I just danced-- Shh. Lead the way. Watch that thing, will you? [interposing voices] [speaking spanish] SAM: All right, all right, all right. Hello, Plato. Marta. Long time no see. I need you to do something. Something no one else can do. You told me that once before. And then you found a guy you said could do it a lot better. There are two escaped prisoners stranded on the beach in Pinar del Rio. Well, they're history. No one escapes from Cuban prisons, lady. Are you asking me to unstrand them? Yes. Just a job for which you happen to have the right resume. [clears throat] Excuse me. Um, are we volunteering for this, or, uh, is somebody gonna pay us? $50,000. There's more money to be made than that clearing mines in Kuwait. That's $50,000 up front, $50,000 on delivering the two men. Who's paying for this? Marta. Who's paying for this? Manuel Gomez. The Manuel Gomez? Is one of the men his son? Yes. Well, I don't know his son. But I know Gomez is scum. And I did not do business with arms dealers or gangsters. Sometimes it's necessary. Come on, Plato. You just described your typical politician. He's a survivor. You got to give him that. They've made more attempts on his life than on Castro's. Come on. So, Plato, are you in or out? No thank you, Marta. You disappoint me. For the second time. [latin music playing] [SINGING] Just Sam and Plato [inaudible].. You know what you need, man? You' got to reduce the stress factor in your life. You got to get to relax. Something relaxing like invading Cuba. Putting you on that plane is gonna get me time to relax. Nothing personal. We done it 100 times. Simple extraction, man. Come on. Piece of cake. The cake is gonna be Kathy's birthday party on Tuesday. And there's no way I'm gonna miss it, because I'm lighting the candles and that's it. Nothing's stopping you from doing it. SAM: Oh yes there is. PLATO: Oh yeah? SAM: You. PLATO: Me? SAM: Yeah. You're the package man. I'm just along for laughs. The woman was looking at you. I saw it in her eyes. It's you she wants, man. You don't know her like I do. She can't stand me. Well, what's she gonna do to you, Plato? Huh? What are you, afraid of women now? [laughs] I don't trust them. There's another one. [horn honking] [beeping] Matty, drop the gate. We got the son of a gun this time. [laughs] [bell ringing] What son of a gun is it this time, Buddy? BUDDY [ON RADIO]: It's Mr. Plato. Cool. That son of a gun. [bell ringing] [sirens] [horn honking] Open the bridge. Sorry. Do you realize you're going 60 mile an hour back there in-- in a 45 mile an hour zone? Listen, you could endanger lives or personal property. And-- and don't think I don't know you were out drinking last night. Because I do. Plato, you're-- you're so darn irresponsible. Do you hear me? KATHY: Hi, Buddy. Hi. Um, are you-- are you going in the direction of school? Yeah, I-- I guess I can drop you off there. OK. Hey, let me just get my things. [laughs] Wipe your feet. What do we got here? It was Sam's last night before he takes off to a war zone. He wanted to go hear some music. He asked me to go with him for some support. You just missed the sheriff. It's an eviction notice. We have to be out of here in two weeks. This is wrong. The bank assured me I had at least a month to pay him off. KATHY: Plato. I know you want to go to Kuwait with Sam. I mean, you miss that life and, you know, I think you should go with him. No no, no. KATHY: You should go. No. That's the last thing I want to do. I'm your father. I want to spend time with you now more than I ever have. You're my only child. You're my daughter. No, no. I think you should go. I mean, I've always taken care of myself. I'm good at it. You know, when I was growing up, Grandma always built you up, and I thought of you as this hero. She always had an excuse for why you weren't around, you know, saying you were off saving the world. I mean, you probably were, this Navy SEAL guy [inaudible] right. But the reality that I see, Plato-- is you're a loser. [groaning] Here. Oh boy. Look at that. I'll take the poles. You take the girl. Nice car. Where's my guy, and where my $50,000? I'm coming with you. No. You're not coming. I'm part of this package. This is the 50 grand? Let me see. OK. Guess you better welcome her on board. Welcome aboard. Who's this? Investor. Committee member. He wants to make sure I'm on that boat. I'm his guarantee. I didn't say you could go. I'm protecting your investment. You're my investment. You know nothing will happen to me. Do I? So it's not Cuban patrol boats you're worried about. When did you pick him? Aside from short notice, he's the best man for the job. Is he? I'll be back before you know I'm gone. [dramatic music playing] Cutter 2, cutter 2. [radio interference] Cutter 2, cutter 2. [radio interference] Cutter 2, cutter 2 MAN [ON RADIO]: [inaudible] This is cutter 2. So who's your favorite singer tonight? MAN [ON RADIO]: [speaking spanish] What do you like? Diana Ross. MAN [ON RADIO]: [speaking spanish] OK. That was the backup code. They had it right. They're 500 meters east of the lighthouse. Good. Yeah, well, if they caught him after that first contact, they would have had him, like, 48 hours already. They'd have to be awful good or awful lucky not to get caught. The jungle's thick. The code for saying they'd been captured was Pat Boone. [laughs] It's a good choice for being tortured. Those Cubans could find out any code by now. All right, Sam. We're off. Now, if you see any flares, take this boat out and pass the 12 mile limit. And keep your open. [motor boat engine running] [gunfire] Where's your friend? Donde esta tu amigo? Come on, come on. [explosions and gunfire] Stay down. [inaudible] Go, go, go, go! Get out of here! [motor boat engine running] You were the right man. For what? The job. I know. Is he awake yet? Awake? He's eating everything on board. Put you on automatic pilot. This guy eats like a horse. Like a horse? That's good. [inaudible] Oh no. That's OK, that's OK. [speaking spanish] Que pasa con su amigo? [speaking spanish] Por favor, hable English? Mi Espanol no bueno. Oh, sorry-- sorry. Sorry, no. We were running, man. We were running down in the jungle. And [inaudible] bullets [inaudible] everywhere [inaudible]. And I look at him, [inaudible] very, very bad. I go to him. He said, shoot me, please. I beg you. I cannot go back to prison, please. And I say, me cannot, you know? He's my best friend, man. 15 years with my best friend in prison. He said, if you love me, man, shoot me, please. Please. Or give me gun. [inaudible] shoot me. [inaudible] you know? You know better I shoot him or give him gun, you know. And I say [inaudible]. I had two bullets. I gave him gun. And the soldiers come, so I start running and running and running. [inaudible] I know [inaudible] I know [inaudible] His family live in Miami. And what do I tell them, huh? What did I tell them? In this case, the truth. Love your dad, hombre. You did right. You did right. [latin music playing] Gracias, mi amigo. Told you. Piece of cake. I know what you said. You stay here. I'm gonna go get the money. All right. Vaya con Dios, Felix. Welcome home, son. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Hoy que pasa-- You were right, Marta. This is a very happy event, and I'm glad to be a part of it. Now I'll just go get my $50,000 and be gone. Your money is being delivered to your house now. Better you're not seen here. And you must respect the privacy between a father and his son. [inaudible] Well, I do respect the privacy between a father and his son. But this deal said $50,000 on delivery. And I'm delivering the son to the father. You're totally insensitive. You haven't changed. [laughs] Plato, keep your eyes open. OK. [giggling] [inaudible] [speaking spanish] [gunshot] [grunts] [alarm going off] Senor Gomez? [gunfire] Plato! Plato! [inaudible] Come on! Southern Florida was rocked this afternoon by what police believed to be a political assassination. Manuel Gomez, the controversial Cuban exiles leader, was shot once in the head, dying instantly. This man, identified as Plato Smith, is the object of the largest manhunt in recent Florida history. Stephanie Stakulus is at the Gomez mansion. Stephanie? It was right here that witnesses saw Plato Smith, armed with a pistol, run across that lawn and dive here into this canal. Observers are wondering if Plato Smith, a Navy SEAL hero of Desert Storm, and allegedly a CIA operative in Lebanon and Afghanistan, is another case of a cold warrior without a war tempted by the offer of easy money. The question being asked here tonight is, who paid for the hit. Concerning the reward, which is now $250,000, a word of caution to you bounty hunters from law enforcement officials. Smith, if he survived his escape from the Gomez mansion, is considered armed and extremely dangerous. Kat-- [interposing voices] On your knees. All the way down. - Hey! All right. You're under arrest. You got the wrong guy. --can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. SENARKIAN: Well, I hear Senor Gomez, late of Miami, will not be cheating me anymore. Nor anyone else for that matter. What about the son? I let him enjoy the escape. Then I shot him. Ah. Well, I spoke to the old man. But he was too greedy. Money isn't everything, is it? But without it, there would be no business, would there, Alejandro? How is business? Mm, [inaudible]. This little devil is going for under $3 now. Look at this. There are over 100 million mines buried on this planet. Isn't it amazing? And to clear one like this costs about a thousand per. So you're now in the mine clearing business. Who better to clear them than the company that sells them? Of course. And much more profitable. It's a moral issue. I'd rather save a life than take one. Don't you agree? Prosthetics. My humanitarian side. Nonprofit, of course. I remember this one from Angola. Pressure mine, huh? You put your foot on it and nothing happens. You take it off, no more foot. Feet do have their spiritual side, don't they? Gives you time to reflect on your sins. Yes, Angola. We made a lot of money on those diamonds, didn't we? Yes we did. But why don't we get back to our current business? I have a plane to catch. Where's my money? Unfortunately, your business is not finished. What do you mean? I did exactly what we agreed on. Oh yes. And a lot more. But you showed very poor judgment in dumping this on Mr. Smith's doorstep. I had to make a decision. And I made one. Yes. But until he is dead, you are not finished. Why is this necessary? Because he knows you. He's seen me. He puts us both together, and he brings his both down. Now, let me show you something. Now, I don't think it's good for your business, or your health, if a known Cuban intelligence officer is involved with an assassination on American soil. You clean up these loose ends, you'll get your money. And you get the tape. Cuba trip's bullshit. Smith is in big-- no, huge debt. So he turns to what he does best. He takes out a contract. - That's your FBI reflex. Not Plato. Going to Cuba to save a guy, that's the Plato Smith that I know. Plato's your boy. And it better not be you CIA spooks that hit Gomez. You guys spent tens of thousands of dollars training these cowboys. End up costing law enforcement millions. Well, it's about time somebody put a stop to it. What happened to the surveillance tape of the murder? I ain't got a surveillance tape of the murder. With a gun in his hand. Why did he run? Look, if he's anywhere in South Florida, we'll have by sundown. Dead or alive, right? That is correct. Let's set him free. Domestic case, FBI jurisdiction. Why didn't they teach you that at Yale? [whistling and trickling] [beeping] Oh! Damn [inaudible]. I'm sorry, sir. You're gonna have to put your hands right there on that dashboard. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to take you in. You don't need that. The whole damn world's looking for you, Plato. What-- was it something the government made you do? I didn't kill him. Now, this operation wasn't supposed to turn out this way. I'm gonna have to trust you. And you're gonna have to believe in me. I know you're a straight shooter. So listen to me very carefully. I'm undercover for the CIA. This operation has been approved by the highest levels. The highest, you mean like, the-- the governor? You mean the-- the highest level. The highest level. I can't come out of deep cover. If I know you're there when I need you, we can both expose this whole conspiracy. Everyone else is chasing the wrong guy. I could set it up where you'll nail the real killer, and it would be the biggest case in South Florida history. And that will move you right to captain. So, so all that wild stuff was just-- was just an act, right? I knew it. I mean, a man with your service record and everything. So being a drunk and chasing women and driving like a fool, it was just part of your cover, right? I knew it. I knew it. OK, OK slow down. I'd like you to give this note to Kathy. All right. And the other note to my tai chi partner. Yeah, Sam. He-- he's at the house. Good. Now, I may have to make a citizen's arrest. You take care of Kathy. Sure. And zip up your pants. Uh-- Plato? You don't care if Mr. Smith dies, do you? Why should I? But I do care that you used me. That's love. People being useful to each other. Gomez's people are looking for me. I'm not safe anywhere. You're always safe here. [thunder rumbling] BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: It's back to Rogers. [inaudible] Oh, knocked away. Rebounded by the Hurricanes. James Wilson must now replace Smith at point. He's out of there with Barry Taylor, Murray and Rodgers for the 'Canes. Rogers gets the pass. Oh, nice move. Nice soft touch there by Rodgers. Quite a game, huh? BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: Rogers now has 19 point for the Hurricanes. Yeah. I love them 'Canes. BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: Now brings [inaudible].. Takes it inside-- You know, I was just getting used to having him at home I even kind of started to like him. A little. - A little, huh? BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: [inaudible].. Nice move [inaudible] Sam. Do you-- do you think he's gonna, um-- do you think he's gonna be OK? Oh yeah I'd just put that thing in the freezer if I were you. you know what I mean? You think it's gonna be that long? With your daddy, you can never tell. But don't worry. Hey. He's the best. I'm gonna go get us some pizza. Yeah. BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: [inaudible] But he misses it and it's [inaudible]. All right. He's coming out. Get ready. This could be it. [thunder rumbling] Oh great. Great, great, great. It's all we need. What the hell was that? Did you hear that? Thought I heard a boat. [motor running] [inaudible] [inaudible] BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: [inaudible] And it was a score for [inaudible]. Sorry I'm late. Could have picked a better place, man. I [inaudible] And also, you were the only one who knew where we were last Wednesday night. You don't have to worry about the kid. [inaudible] undercover bullshit. Now, what happened to Gomez? We walked in and Felix popped him, just like that. Man, that's guy's a hell of an actor, I'll tell you. This was a setup from the get-go, Sam. And we got to find him. Shit. By now, he's back in Havana smoking [inaudible] with Fidel. Maybe not. If I were him, I'd want me dead. Then he's home free. He's clear. - Yeah? Well, you need him alive. And I'd say he's got the easier job, because everybody knows you know. Nobody knows him. How's Kathy? Well, she's not crazy about having a celebrity parent. [inaudible] home on the 6:00 news. But she told me tell you she's fine. Good. I'm really sorry I missed her birthday. I was trying to end my absentee fatherism this year. Yeah, well, I'd say you have a pretty good excuse this time. Don't worry. - Yeah. Have you heard anything from our friend Marta? Our friend Marta? Yeah. No. [inaudible] asking about it. You know what? I think we'd just been spotted, man. I'd like to get the hell out of here. Bike's out back. OK. That's OK. I got the bill. [cheering] And where are you from originally? I'm originally from North Carolina. [inaudible] And where are you from? New York State. Well, thank you for coming down to the Sunshine State. Excuse me, sir. Are you a tourist? Excuse me, sir. are-- are you a tourist? Please. Do I look like a terrorist to you? Sir, not terrorist, sir, tourist. Are you a tourist? No. I'm a native. I'm half Jewish and half Seminole. Oh, that's an interesting combination. Sir, we're asking Miamians this week what they feel is the most serious problem confronting south Florida. Oh, this is easy. It's crime. It's definitely crime. It's totally unacceptable to let dangerous criminals loose on the streets. Think of our children. That man behind me in a red coat because a pedophile on parole. He was in prison for five years. Isn't that scary. Yes it is, sir. Thank you. Well, use your editorial power and do something about it. All right. I will. Excuse me, sir. I'm told by this gentleman you just served five years for child molestation. Do you feel you're sufficiently-- There you have it. Here at Channel 9 news. Stephanie Stokulus reporting. Ah, God. [heavy breathing] Now listen to me. I did not kill Mr. Gomez. The truth is I went to Cuba to pick up his son. I had no idea what was going to happen to me. Drop your gun. You'll be dead before it hits the floor. He doesn't care. He's dead already. You see, he lets his jefe be assassinated. He failed. I saw the video cameras. You have a tape, so look at it and you'll see I didn't do it. Oh, we know you didn't do it. It was Miguel, Miguelito Herrera, KGB-trained. But what we want to know right now is why you and the CIA are working for Herrera. Why kill Gomez? I don't work for the CIA. I know nothing about this. Hey. Now wait a minute. We want no problems with the CIA. You got that? Huh? We just want some information. Where is Herrera? And where is Marta, the woman that came to us? Drop your gun. Now. Good move. [grunting] [gunshot] [groaning] Drop it, Felix. Or whatever your name is. Now! Put it down! [gunfire] Fuck. This is an AT-4 manufactured in Sweden, used by the American military, effective against any main battle tank in the world. Its optimum range is 350 meters. [explosion] You had a lot better aim with Senor Gomez than you did with Senor Smith. Rupert. Rupert. Sit. Go get him. But sir-- Yes, sir. Let me go get the map. Now. Get him now. Sir, I can't remember where all the mines are. Now! But sir, he's trained to smell mines. Maybe he could just-- Get in there. Easy, boy. Easy, boy. Quiet. Quiet. Rupert, sit. Sit. Sit. Stay. Stay. [barking] Rupert! Here, boy. Come on. Yeah. Bad dog. Bad dog. [clicking] [explosion] We better clean him up before he attracts the alligators. Baker. Take him. You know why that dog is so loyal? Because I rescued him from the Pakistanis. They used to use those dogs to clear the mine fields in Afghanistan. Can you imagine? The human species, the lowest. Where were we? Ah, getting you back to Havana. I think you have to find Mr. Smith and kill him. Well, I can guarantee you that he won't be so easy to find now. Oh, I think you'll find Marta. You see, if violence doesn't work, we'll use sex. Not the act itself, mind you. But the promise of sex. And then the guarantee of violence. [music playing] MARTA [ON RADIO]: Ah! You scared me. I had no way of finding. Thank god you're all right. PLATO [ON RADIO]: I've been on the run, Marta. What's going on? MARTA [ON RADIO]: I had no idea Gomez was going to be killed. PLATO [ON RADIO]: I don't know who to believe. MARTA [ON RADIO]: Here You can believe this. It's the security tape. I took it from Senarkian's safe. It will clear you. PLATO [ON RADIO]: That's good. MARTA [ON RADIO]: Damn you, Plato Smith. I still love you, even though you're impossible. I still love you. PLATO [ON RADIO]: I still love you too, Marta. [gunshots] Marta. Marta. [gunfire] Come on, Plato. Come on, Plato. [inaudible] Come on, man. Come on. Let's go. Come on [inaudible]. Come on, come on. Plato! God damn it. Come on, Plato. We got to get the fuck out of here. Go. Come on. Move, move, move! Come on. I got [inaudible] Got to get out of here. [grunting] [shouting] And you don't know why the transfer took too long? No. Sometimes, there's a problem with the computer. You didn't tell me that your cousin was the banker in the Caymans. I swear, I will make good on any interest lost by the delay. I give you my word. Good. I'll take care of it. I promise. Now tell me about your great success. He killed her. Who? What? Plato Smith. He shot Marta. That's not possible. I'm sorry. I know how much she meant to you. What happened? Exactly I'm not sure. I got there too late. All I know is that he shot her in the back. He must have tricked her, because he got the tape before he shot her. Baker, call the office. And see if anyone's tampered with the safe. This wouldn't have happened if you'd done your job. No. This would have happened if Marta-- Marta what? Plato Smith has a child, a daughter. You're gonna bring her here. We're gonna make a little swap. The daughter for the father. Thanks, Buddy. No problem, Kat. Um, and I-- I want you to know I really appreciate everything. Well, I-- I promised your dad I'd take care of you. And I will. And Kat, I-- I just want you to know that everything's gonna be just fine. I-- I promise. All right?

Have a nice day, ma'am. So, five copies you said? Yes, ma'am. Did you guys shoot this? No. Good thing. Because honestly, it looks really fake. I mean, I don't know who shot this. But what I would have done is I would have brought the camera in really tight. You could get a lot more realism. I can't even see the actors. Who is it? Anybody I know? No. It's a, uh, student film. - [inaudible] - It shows. Take that off. Now, we've been having some problems locating your father. But you're gonna help us. Phone. Did you hear what I said? Call him.

I know where that is, OK? Aramco that's outside the Everglades. I was there for a wargames kind of deal about a year ago. It's high security. You're reviewing your options? Plato? - I have no options. I have no choice. I'm going. All right, it's extraction, man. We've done it 101 times. It's a piece of cake. Hey, listen to me. I'm going with you. All right? Affirmative. We're gonna need the whole team. Yeah. Well, I guess you better go up. He'll be close and he'll try something. I would. Baker? Now, I know I'm an optimist. But I'm hoping that you'll have enough professional pride not to take that until you make sure that Mr. Smith is dead. Really dead. What if he doesn't show. Oh, he'll show. [suspenseful music playing] Here he comes. Heads up. Come on. Careful. He's tricky. Easy. [inaudible] Clear. Clear. Watch your perimeters. Go ahead. Everything's gonna be OK.

Get out. All right [inaudible]. You're pretty good. You should be working for me. After I add up everything it's gonna cost me today, I would have been better off just paying you a million dollars. He's man after my own heart. If I could afford one in this business. [inaudible] Ah, don't be impatient. I'm not a vindictive man. I'm gonna let them all go free. Hold it. Don't close the gates. Our guests are just leaving. Stay strong. Come on. One more thing. You got 10 minutes to get to the water. If you don't get to the water in 10 minutes, I'm going to shoot you personally. Come on. We've got box seats. I got a mental picture of this minefield at this certain area, because I saw them taking off markers where the mines are. Well, then you go first my friend. I'll take over when we get to the gators. We need a-- here we go. [inaudible] insulation. We know there's no mines here. So we go up here. Slow going in. Look, I'm ready to go. Give me my money so I can leave. Don't be such a Cuban in a hurry. You've got to let us savor the moment. "Swift revenge is poor revenge." Machiavelli. I like the American way. Just do it. I'll tell you what. Let's have a bet. I'll bet you $10,000 that the Greek, the [inaudible],, dies first. Come on. You can afford it. [interposing voices] $10,000? Mm-hm. 10 minutes? You're on. I could stick around for 10 minutes. Good. [grunting] Tripwire. Look out from tripwire. Seven minutes. Here. Take this. I'm shaking. Go ahead. You've been doing this more. You feel something? Yeah. Rock. I don't think Marta would have found this boring. PLATO: You boys might get your nuts blown off dead standing there. MAN: You guys having fun playing in our little sandbox? Real damn funny. [explosion] Oops. Hm. [explosions] Listen, these mines are radio-detonated. See these wires right here? He can set one off any time he wants to. [grunts] OK. [panting] What? I'm tired. Your turn. OK. Let's switch. [clicking] Oh [inaudible] Aha. $10,000, comrade. I never lose. Neither do I. The bet was who dies first. Don't move. Don't move. God damn it. PLATO: I'm coming around. What are you doing? I'm coming around. Don't move. Don't even breathe. Stand still. Stand still. [inaudible] are you doing? How much do you weigh? Who wants to know. - I want to know. - 193. I'm 198. That's 5 pounds. We have a 4 and 1/2 pound pressure window. I'm fucking dead. Listen to me real close. You can disarm mines better than I can. I'm gonna transfer my weight on the mine with you transferring your weight off of the mine. This is probably one in a million chances. Sounds nuts, but OK. You count from 100 backwards. And I'll count from 10 forward. 10, 20, 70. 30. 60. 40. 50. 60. 40. 30. 70. 20. 80. 90. 100. [inaudible] I owe you one. I don't believe what they're doing. They don't know what we're doing. This could ruin my bet. [laughs] Hope you're having a good day, Mr. Senarkian. [gagging] [panting] All right. What is he doing? SENARKIAN: Well, he's not shining his shoes. Plato Smith is as good as dead. Just give me the case, plus 10 [inaudible] They're both as good as dead. But the bet is who dies first. Just relax. Disarm it. [laughs] [gunshots] [shouting] I think you'd better come with me. Wait a minute. They're not going anywhere. Mr. Senarkian's gotten up. He's exiting the game booth. Hey, [inaudible] guys. I need you inside. Yep. They're in a hurry. How are we doing down there? Yes. OK. You may move your foot. OK. Let's go get Kathy. There's a path. - [inaudible] - Back up. Stay away. They're gone. [gunshot] [gunfire] Damn it! Oh my god. Dominick. Oh my God. Come on. Come on, come on! Dominick, [inaudible]. Come on. We're almost out. Come on. Come on. I'm gonna help you. Go outside. Find the zodiac and wait for them there. No. You're gonna make it. Come on. You know I can take these guys. All right. Go, go. Don't look back. Run. Go! [gunshot] [groaning] [gunfire] [groaning] [gunshot] [groaning] SAM: Kat. Sam. SAM: It's OK. It's all right. It's OK. It's all right. - Where is he? He's coming. All right. Come on. Let's duck down over here. Come on. [grunting] You took away the love of my life. Now I'm gonna take you away. [grunting] Dominick. You have to take care of her now. [beeping] Sam. KATHY: Plato. Where's Dominick? He's gone. [groaning] Oh my god. Oh my god, what happened to you? I caught one from the helicopter. [explosion] [grunting] [explosions] Here, boy. Come on. Good boy. Now-- now look. Let's be reasonable. I-- I got enough money right here. [clicking] [laughs] No. No. We-- we can't just leave him like that. And we can't. It's too cruel. PLATO: Wake up, Kathy. He kidnapped you. He tried to kill us. No, no. Not him. I mean the dog. He didn't hurt anybody. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. It's OK. Come on. Come on. [panting] Good boy. Good boy. [latin music playing] We did it. We did it. [laughs] How's it feel to be on a job with Plato. Hey. You're not Plato anymore. You're my dad. And I love you. I love you [inaudible]. [laughs] Oh, honey. It's good to be back. It's nice having you back. [latin music playing]
