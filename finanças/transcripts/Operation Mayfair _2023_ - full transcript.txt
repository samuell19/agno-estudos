Hi. Who the hell are you? Get out of my house. I'll call the police. Get out of my house, please! Get out of my house. I'll call the police. Get out of my house, please. Just take what you want and leave. Please, just get out. Get out of my… Please! Please! Help me. I didn't mean to do anything. Take it off. Take it off! Bend. Bend over. It's alright. Please! I'll give you a gift. Moron! -Say you're a moron. -Moron. Loudly! I am not a moron! What do you think? Sir, Sarah Jones was a celebrity. This would be a high-profile case. Get on with it. Yes, sir. I want you to look after me when we are up there DCI. -Yes, sir. -So they are not doing it. Don't worry, sir. We'll handle it. I'm just not convinced. I mean, what if this guy is a copycat killer? There were many details that were not revealed to the media. This is the same guy. True. The fake black tears on the face and the posing of the body. These things were never spoken to the press about. Sir, I'll get started and set up a team. Make sure you get the best guys for the job, yeah? Sir! I think we should get Detective Amar back in this case. Amar? No, he won't be interested. Besides, he has been out of the force for too long. Worth a phone call, sir. He is the best person for this job. Just wondering what he's up to nowadays. Professor of Architecture at Oxford University. Good morning, everyone. Welcome back to Oxford University. Did you know that 29 British Prime Ministers have been from Oxford University? And, 69 Nobel prize winners. One of you could be the next one. Today, we're going to talk about the Radcliffe Camera. This was built in 1749, and it's a science library. Does anyone know why it's called a camera? No? Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'll have to take this call. -Hello, sir. -Amar. How're you doing? -I'm good, sir. Thanks. -And, the family? Tania and Alishka are also fine, sir. Thank you. -Listen, something's come up. -What's that? Check your phone. I'm sending you a crime scene picture. Okay. What do you think? Sarah Jones was a celebrity. And the entire nation would piss on us if I don't pull this off. -So, I was wondering if… -It didn't work out last time, sir. Well, that's because you left the case too early last time, Amar. Goodbye, sir. Well, just think it through, Amar. Bye. Sir? Today's special and shocking report focuses on the brutal murder of fashion model Sarah Jones. Sarah's body was discovered by the police in the early hours of this morning. After a concerned neighbor reported hearing distressed calls from Sarah's pet parrots. This is yet again another example of London's… Hi. There you are. Can I get a coffee, please? Why not, your highness? What are your other wishes? The police investigation is on the way. What's the progress, sir? Our forensics team is combing the place for any possible clues. Do you think the past killings and Sarah's murder are the work of the same person? It's too early to comment on anything. Thank you. Another woman just died yesterday. The police still have no leads. Is the Mayfair Killer back? Where is Alishka? Busy with her phone. As always. Hey, Dad. Alishka? Alishka? What are you doing? How many times have I told you not to hang around my office? -Isn't this epic, Dad? -Epic? She got that from a vintage store. If she's so fond of vintage things, why doesn't she join my Oxford tour? Oxford is so boring. Hey, don't say anything about Oxford, okay? What? Why are you behaving like this? She's just a kid. What did I… Coffee! Amar, don't you feel suffocated? Why do you keep the windows closed? Okay, listen. How about going out this weekend? Alishka's classes would get over soon. It will be a nice outing for all of us. Just a moment. Sit. Sit. Have a look. This. Look at this. This one. Same corporal position. I think… the killer is back. Your mind is still trapped there, right? Our daughter is not happy here. She will be joining college soon. What college? -Seriously, Amar. Bye. -Tania? You just don't care. I do care. That's why I am here. That's how you do it. Now, I know. Let me show you. Okay. Let me try. Okay. Okay. Let's play together. One, two, three. Today, I'm going to read you something from William Shakespeare's Tempest. It will help you a lot. "Past is prologue." Antonio said to Sebastian. Understood? Means what? It means your future will always be connected… to your past. What happened in the past, will come back in your future. Don't forget. Okay? My boy! Dad! Hey! How are you, my boy? -How are you? Good? -I'm good. -Where were you yesterday? -My cutie. I was busy. Story time? Yes. Let's read some stories. Come on. "Past is prologue.", says Antonio to Sebastian, in Tempest. -Got it? -No. Let me explain. Come. It means… his past has paved a way for his tomorrow. Let me explain. It means, his future is connected to his past. Right? Good. You're a moron! You're a moron! You're a moron! You're a moron! Kevin? What's wrong with you? You're scaring me now. Go to sleep. I want you to get on the CCTV footage. You need to check. I need you to knock on every single door. This has been three years now. Look. I need you to get all of it. -Amar, welcome back. -Sir. -It's good to see you. -Same here, sir. The budgetary cuts still apply as you can see from the state of this makeshift office. -It does keep the press off our backs. -Hi, Lisa. It's nice. I like it. Well, I thought you'll say that. Okay. Listen up, everyone. And I think you all know why we're here. A serial killer, who seems to have resurfaced and reemerged from the past. Now, leading our investigation will be DCI Lisa Varma. Thank you, sir. Guys, we also have with us… Mr. Amar Singh. We worked on this case years back. And you know Sonia Kapoor, our in-house criminal psychologist. In actual fact, Amar, it was Lisa who recommended you come and join us on this case, and wants to bring you back. And I for one am very pleased she did. Thank you. -Sir. -Yes, Amar? You never told me Lisa is going to lead this investigation. What does it matter? You want me to answer someone who was… -once my junior? -Amar, listen to me. You're not with the department anymore. Okay? Firstly, it'll take time to reinstate you, which we don't have right now. And secondly, you just have to make this work. -But, sir-- -Catch me the killer. Yes? And work together. Do it for me. Please. Hey, Amar. Come up. We'll talk. Guys, team A will study the suspects. And Sonia will map out the profile of the killer. Can we pick someone out for questioning without a warrant? Of course, you can. But, be careful. I don't want a human rights circus over here. What sort of suspects we're looking for? Let me think. Nutjobs. Let's just say, socially unfit mental behavior. Basically, Sonia, it's all the same. Nutjobs. Excuse me. Why did the killer stop, and start again after three years? Guys, meet Kevin Da Costa, Lead Forensic Investigator on this case. He worked with us on this case in the past as well. Hello, everybody. Hi. So guys, basically, the mind of a serial killer is a complex maze. You never know when he's going to start. And you never know when he's going to stop. Kevin, what do the forensics have to say? No evidence. The killer doesn't leave anything behind. There's never such a thing as no evidence. It's always about perspective. Maybe, that's the clue within itself. Well. May God help us all. It's so nice to see you here, Amar. I wish you never left. All of us have our reasons, Lisa. I had no choice. Never mind. Hey, but this time, we'll catch the killer. Okay? So, let's start afresh from the scratch. Have you noticed any common pattern, Amar? The women are between 25 and 30. No obvious connections. Okay, you mean… easy-going targets. Girls who live alone. Right? It can also be a "love story gone sour". If the killer is a male, he kills the woman… he sees as his girlfriend. -What will you have? -The usual. One egg Benedict, one egg Florence, and two black coffees, please. You're looking nice. Thank you. And I'm sorry. Looking at you, I can't say the same about you. But it's good to have you back. By the way, how are Tania and Alishka? We are seeing each other after three years. And you're asking about my wife and my daughter? All you needed was a few days off. You were the one who declared me unfit. Did you say… stress disorder or something like that? All I suggested was to not take this case so seriously. You just needed a few days off and some counseling, that's all. I am more afraid to tarnish my reputation than my work And you knew that well enough. -Thank you. -Thank you. -So, what did you want to say? -Sonia, I'm sorry. I just couldn't say… a proper sorry to you. All of us have our reasons. Anyway, the road we took would not have led us anywhere. Thank you for the day. I had a lovely time. Me too. Sorry, I just slipped. It's okay. I should also leave. Okay. Good night. -I'll see you in the office tomorrow. -Good night. Let me just highlight a case study. The Golden State Killer, in 1976, committed many such rapes and murders in Sacramento, USA. By 1986, all these activities stopped on their own. -Why? -Like, Amar said… a serial killer's mind is a complex maze. In 2018, the police arrested 72-year-old, Joseph James DeAngelo. He was charged with eight murders. And he was, the Golden State Killer. So, what was he doing for 30 years? Maybe, he was waiting for the right opportunity. Serial killers think carefully before executing a murder. They are very calculative. Right. All these activities are intentional and predatory. Choice, capacity, and opportunity… a killer has them all. Usually, these killers… -have some psychological issues-- -What psychological? It could also mean that they need stability in life. Maybe he's introspecting his art. Excuse me. Why did you ask that question? Which question? That, why did the killer return after so long? It was just a thought. Why? I shouldn't have asked? Oh, no. That's okay. Relax. Anyways… I like people who are curious. You can ask anything. So? What do you think? I think the killer is left-handed. The angle of the victim's neck says so. I am… taking this file with me. I'll return it after a proper study. Police are investigating the killing of the fashion model Sarah Jones. The body was placed in a strange way with her arms stretched out. Amar Singh, like the last time, has no solution to the multiple killings of women across London. Reporting live from the ministry. Look at me! Get down on your knees! Yeah! You are a moron! Look at me! Get down on your knees! You, boy! You are a moron! You are a moron! You are a moron! You, boy. You are a moron! You are a moron! Moron! Can you say, "Boy, you are a moron"? You are a moron. Point your finger… and say it like you're angry. You are a moron. Loudly! Boy, you are a moron! -Louder. -Boy, you are a moron! A twat! That's a moron! Do it, more louder. I'll give you a gift. -Boy, you are a moron! -Yeah! I must say. No one can bake a cake better than you in the entire world. I made it especially for you. With extra-extra sugar. Just the way you like it. You still remember? Extra sugar. Like everything else, my life hasn't changed enough… for me to forget that. In the last three years away from here, I tried to lead a normal life. It was tough learning how to suppress my emotions. You should also do the same. No girl moves ahead on her own in a relationship. The heart has some hope. Maybe this relationship will have a name or a destination. Does Tania know about us? Sir. We have a call-up. DCI Lisa Varma is waiting for you in the car. Thank you for the cake. My God! Whip marks. Black tears on the face. Index finger missing. Set up a perimeter around the house, and I don't want any reporters here. Kevin… when did she die? It's been almost ten hours. Are you sure? Rigor mortis sets in after two to six hours. It starts with the jaw, then spreads from the neck to the hips. Later, the entire body. It takes about six to eight hours. The cause of death is the same. The index finger is also missing. Any clue from the surgical instrument test of the last case? -It will be done by the evening. -Okay. Angad? Alexa, play the recording. Your speaker has lost connection to the internet. Alexa. Play recording! Your speaker has lost connection to the internet. Okay. Now, Alexa ma'am will solve the case. Alexa ma'am, will you be solving Operation Mayfair? Try to get the point, Lisa. If this device was on for such a long time, it should've definitely recorded some conversation. Right? It must be in a loop post-communication break after the murder. Nowadays, people talk to these devices. Alexa! Play recording! Your speaker has lost connection to the internet. You are absolutely right. The concept of society has turned virtual. If people like you are around… -who will people talk to? -That's also right. But I still feel that we should explore this option. Amar, when the killer was in the house last night, Alexa ma'am was hearing everything. Right? -And she was also recording. -What was Alexa hearing? How can we find that? If we are unable to find out, we should send this device to the company or to some expert. Alexa! Play recording! Your speaker has lost connection to the internet. Amar, I'm really sorry. It's not going to happen. It would take weeks. What other option do we have? We finally got a clue. Should we let it go down the drain? Amar, we cannot follow every lead, okay? Lisa, either you should change your perception… or work as per mine. Amar! Your speaker has lost connection to the internet. Boy, you're a moron! Boy, you're a moron! We should send this device to the company or to some expert. Moron! You're a moron! You're a moron! You, boy. You're a moron! Kevin. Kevin! What are you doing? Kevin, it's me! Do you want a spanking? You are a moron! Kevin! Kevin, are you okay? Get inside! Get away from here! The Home Minister has summoned Commissioner Douglas, Investigator Amar Singh, -and DCI Lisa Varma on the latest… -Hey! -update on the murder of Sarah Jones. -Guys, move. Sir, please come in. Please, excuse us. Guys, move! Please, move. Sir. Guys! I've got the press on my ass. I've got the other ministers on my throat asking questions. And I don't have answers. I can assure you, minister, we are doing our very best. Douglas… you need to get your team on speed. You need to close the Operation Mayfair case. Yes, sir. Sit down. Sir. Sir. It's about time, we show them some action. Sir, I got an idea. Maybe we can round up some goons, and take them in custody for a day, just to keep the media silent. What do you think? That's not going to solve any problems. That's a good plan, Lisa. -Buys us some time. -Yes, sir. We will need some warrants for that. Yes! Sir, we are not Taliban. Amar, you know the drill, right? Yeah, you both know the score, okay? Now, round up all the usual suspects. Any ace criminals you can find. And get me someone who just comes off the boat. And some loony homeless guys as well, maybe. And arrange a press conference for tomorrow. -Yes! Get busy. -Sure, sir. Hi, Melinda. How are you? I am doing fine. How are you, Sonia? You know it! We, psychiatrists, help others with their stress. Who will help us with our stress? True. I wanted to talk about the same. About stress. Yes, I am listening. For the past few days, I am very disturbed. I get angry for silly reasons. I can't sleep well at night. I get violent, I get angry. -Did you tell Kevin? -No, he won't understand. He'll tell me to reduce stress, do yoga, and stuff. And what are the other symptoms? I get flashes of some strange images. As if someone is choking me. I feel sweaty, I hallucinate. I feel like killing someone. I think you need counseling. With proper medication. Or things can get worse. You can be a threat to yourself, and others as well. Oh, my turn now! Hold it, man! Guys! Go! Stop! Stop moving! Hands up! Move. Hey! Don't move. DCI Varma, what's the update? Sir, I've got some new suspects. Good job, DCI Varma. Thank you, sir. There has been a major breakthrough in the Operation Mayfair case. As you can see, our police officers have caught some possible suspects. This case may be connected to an earlier case, whose trail went cold some time ago… and the investigation is still going on. The killer is still at loose. Operation Mayfair case is still not solved yet. The desires of the soul Have started taking difficult exams In the worries of my duty I will unite the Earth and the sky The desires of the soul Have started taking difficult exams In the worries of my duty I will unite the Earth and the sky My goal is with me That is why I am passionate about it I have accomplished The whole world of love But the prayers of my people Have become light for me It’s still a thick fog But the prayers of my people Have become light for me My happiness My aid is looking for a killer in me I have always had A little bit of animosity Toward conspiracies Fear has spread far and wide But I have glimmers of courage by my side We will have to go to the place Where there is a galaxy of peace But the prayers of my people Have become light for me It’s still a thick fog But the prayers of my people Have become light for me -Hi. -Hello. Missing us already? This place reminds me of everything before I resigned. Let it be. How are you? Alright. Where are you guys? At Alishka's favorite restaurant. Dear, say hi to Papa. Hi, Dad! We've ordered pizza. See you, bye! Okay, dear. See you too. You're in her favorite city. That's why she is acting up. Tell her I miss her. Okay, our pizza is here. -I'll call you later. Okay? Bye! -Bye. Be a little friendly with your dad. You know he is struggling, right? Dear, if the police force doesn't have people like your father, you wouldn't see so many smiling faces around. You should feel proud of your father. But he can also be a good dad, right? Kevin! It's 4:00 a.m. I have some work to do. You should sleep. I'll be there. Okay. Please, help yourself. I would like to confess to the recent spate of murders. I was thrown out of my job and my wife abandoned me. I killed all those women because they reminded me of my wife. I know you guys will catch me one day for sure, and before you guys do that, I am ending my own life. -Hello, Amar? -Yeah, Lisa. There has been another murder. -In Aspen forest. -What? Oh, God! Jared Morgan. He was in prison for five years. Got drunk and killed a patient in surgery. He lives alone on this farm. I mean, used to live. Where is Kevin? Any clues? Amar, he confessed via an email to Met Police. They thought it was spam. Who found the body? He found it. Jared Morgan, I know him. He was a good guy. I was going for walk like every day. Having a cup of coffee with him. This place needs cleaners rather than cops. -Kevin. -Yeah? What about the gun? It's a smuggled one. I have handed it over to the ballistics. His phone? He sent the email using this. Good catch. I don't think he used the phone much. -How can you say that? -There's so much filth around, but the phone doesn't even have a scratch. It's a new phone. Amar… the case is solved! Jared's email confession. Doesn't feel right. Why? What's wrong? Look at him. He's a drunk loser. A man like him will always make mistakes. How can he commit such perfect murders? Amar, we have his written confession. Plus, we've recovered two surgical knives. Sir… the report from the lab. The traces of metal and the surgical knives found at Jared's trailer… are a perfect match. Something is just not right. I am telling you. This man has not sent a single email since the time he was let off from his job. And his suicide note. It's too perfectly worded for a person like him. Another conspiracy theory. And look at all these pictures. We already know that all these victims have been killed by somebody who is a left-handed person. And this man shot himself with his right hand. How can he be the murderer? Kevin. Kevin! Are you okay? Yeah, I am fine. Sir, may I leave? I think the killer is doing all this to deviate our attention. Amar, please understand that this is an open and shut case. Lisa. This is a murder case. Not some petty pickpocket stuff. I am sorry, sir. But if I am not allowed to flex my muscles, then what is the use of bringing me down over here? Anything I say is no good. He's got a valid point. And I am not convinced either. It's a new phone. And his suicide note. It's too perfectly worded for a person like him. Shot himself with his right hand. What's wrong? Why do you look so upset? There's no help here. I don't know why I was called here. The commissioner, Lisa… nobody listens to me. You know I was the one who taught Lisa the basics of investigation. Your gut feeling is strong. Linger on it even if nobody does. Be friends with your team. Take everyone with you. Lead them like you always used to do. Okay, boss. See you soon. -Bye. -Bye. Kevin. This is a routine evaluation. Everyone working on this case has to go through it. Okay, let's do it then. In your previous session, you mentioned that your skills are not utilized completely. Correct. Then why did you apply for it again? It's because this case wasn't solved the last time. I thought it was important to solve it this time. And, thanks to Commissioner Douglas for trusting me. That's great. I like the positivity. But is the burden of expectations stressing you out? Not really. It wouldn't matter if the job isn't done right. But it shouldn't spoil one's reputation. You are worried… that people would question your ability? You, boy! Moron! Do you want a spanking? You are a moron! Kevin. Kevin, what are you thinking? Something came to my mind. -It's regarding the case. -What? Whatever Amar does, is right. Amar! He has an eye for detail. And I don't, right? Amar is a hero to everyone. And I… What? Moron! I am a moron, right? Okay, calm down. You don't have to say this. Did anyone say this word to you before? You are a moron! My stepmother did. Your stepmother? You never mentioned her. Can we not talk about her? Were you guys close? -Kevin? -I… I have to go somewhere. Kevin! Well done, my boy! Now, let's play something else. Let's play something else. Okay? Try this. Unpaid bills! All you do is drink and play with the boy. You don't even go to work. Quite. Please, he is listening. Let him listen. His father is a useless drunken slob. Oh, I should never have married you. Listen. We can manage. We can pay the bill. We can pay them. -I'll tell you. -How are you going to pay? Boy! Stop! You don't even go to work. Drink and play with the boy. Where's my money, you punk? I will pay you back. I promise. Or else, we are going to smash your face. No, don't! -Got it? -Yes… -Got it? -I'll pay you back. I promise I will. I will. Please leave. Thanks. You are useless! And it's all because of that boy. -Get over here! -No. You, boy! You are a moron! You are a moron! You are a moron! Get down on your knees. I'm going to give you a good spanking. Get back. There! Get back, or I will kill the pair of you! All because of your father and his uselessness. But you did that years ago… There! You, boy! You are a moron! Moron! Moron! Papa, those were bad people, right? Let me tell you something from Shakespeare's Tempest. Okay. Just like a dark night can turn into… bright daylight. Similarly, good can turn evil and good once again. Don't forget. There is no such thing called good or evil. It's just our deeds. We reap what we sow. -Got it? -Yes. Let's walk. Son, choose the path you want to follow. And never deviate from that path. Commissioner Douglas had called me. Oh! When? Another dead body of a girl has been found. Poor girl! What do you mean by that? Hey, why are you yelling at me? -Forget it. -What else can you say? Tania, try to understand. What am I not understanding, Amar? Is Alishka finding it difficult to adjust here? Did you ever ask her? Now what? Amar, when you were a cop, you were mentally not with us. And now, when you're with us, your mind still wanders around. You need to make yourself understand. Come on, now don't sulk. Help me, please. I think you should go. I know, your mind is still trapped in that case. Lock your past. And throw the keys in River Thames when you come back. Don't worry about Alishka. Hey. Nice apartment! How did you get this? From Airbnb. Okay. I was trying to call you, but it kept going to your voicemail. I didn't get any calls. Should we get some sushi? I don't feel like it, Sonia. Never mind. Let's order it online. You're working on this case a lot. I think you need a break. Sonia, please. Sonia! -Please. -What's wrong? We are meeting after three years, and why are you behaving like a stranger? Sonia, please! I'm sorry. The time I spent with you will always be special for me. I loved spending time with you back then, and… even now, I love it. I always thought that you would care for me. But, perhaps I'm expecting more. Or you have changed. Sonia, I'm not like this with just you. My behavior towards all has changed. In the last three years… my frustration has overpowered me. I feel like, the entire world's burden… has been kept on my shoulders. I understand. And don't worry, I… I won't get any closer to you. Thanks. What's wrong, Amar? Where have you been? I looked for you everywhere. Just came to get some fresh air. To get good thoughts. You should try it as well. Your good thoughts have created a mess for me. Have a look. What is this? It's the report from Alexa ma'am. -Lisa, this is the last day's report? -Yeah. "Hey, come in. So, this is my room. Make yourself comfortable. I'll just be back. Say this. Boy, you're a moron. Boy, you're a moron. Boy, You're a moron." -What does that mean? -Looks like… the killer asked Sally to say these lines and artificial intelligence picked it up. So, it formed a loop on Alexa. Is it of any help? Maybe, or maybe not. Oh! Amar, get to the point. It's a big clue. We must definitely explore. By the way… Kevin is throwing a party for us. Are you coming? Congratulations, Kevin! Nice catch! You can use your right hand equally well. Actually, I'm good with both my hands. I'm ambidextrous. ˌ -Cheers! -Cheers! The killer is very smart. Destroys all evidence… after the murder. I think we should change our perspective. Often, things are in front of us, but we fail to see them. I feel the same. The killer is right in front of us, and… we are unable to recognize him. Thank you. Hi, Lisa. Hey, Amar. What's up? -Thanks for the Alexa report. -Okay. Anything else? I'm going home this weekend. To see Tania. Want to come along? Me? Tania's barbecue is still the same. If arguing with you gets me good food, I'll always try to mess with you. Hey. Hey, bro. I am Justin. I've got a job for you. You know Amar Singh Dhillon? He is a cop. I hate Amar. He's not a cop anymore. He has moved to Oxford. I want you to take him out. I am a professional. What's your offer? He'll be home this weekend. I'll drop you right there. Okay. -Nice to meet you. -What do you want, guys? I was just thinking we could go for a drink or something. You know, just you and me. I know about a place around the corner. Sorry, guys! I have a boyfriend. So, please… -Oh, boyfriend. Oh, she has a-- -I have a boyfriend. -I have to go, please. -Oh, a boyfriend. -Where's your boyfriend? -No, I have a boyfriend. I have to go. Hey! Thank you for taking care of my girl. That's alright. -Let's go. -Hey, thanks for saving me. So, what's your name? Kevin. I'm Olivia. Can I buy you a drink? Sure. I'm so happy that you are here. You know what? I'm going to meet my friends in the club. Come along with me. No. Hey, let's have some fun. Come with me. Hey, we'll have fun. Come. The night asks What is with you? Forget yourself and listen to this Your madness has engulfed me Like me, you should commit a crime You won't get another chance, darling Take this moment to live your life Darling, you will regret Once the moment is gone Write with your lips a new story Darling, you will regret Once the moment is gone Why my sight feels delirious When you come near me Why my sight feels delirious When you come near me When I lose consciousness I feel I am fine The night asks What is with you? Forget yourself and listen to this Your madness has engulfed me Like me, you should commit a crime You won't get another chance, darling Take this moment to live your life Darling, you will regret Once the moment is gone Write with your lips a new story Darling, you will regret Once the moment is gone Take this moment to live your life Darling, you will regret Once the moment… -Hey, Kevin. -Is gone Write with your lips -This is my address. Come to my home. -A new story -Darling, you will regret once it is gone -Love you. No robbery, no enmity. No sexual assault. I don't get the motive behind this. I think this is a trauma case. You know, some people cannot manage trauma well. Yeah. But even then… finding not even a single DNA clue… it's a bit unusual. The killer is very smart. His actual job starts after the murder. He leaves each spot absolutely clean. Just give it a thought. Kevin and his team… couldn't find any DNA clue. I still feel it's very unusual. Amar, what do you want to say? Should we change the forensic team, or isn't Kevin doing his work properly? No, that's not what I mean. But it's too much of a coincidence. And I just hate coincidences. Why don't you stop talking about your work? Tandoori chicken is ready. Hi, Tania. It smells awesome! Let me get some beer. -Lisa? -Yes? You look lean. Really? -But, don't I look fit? -Of course. Hey! I'll call for backup. Thank you, Lisa. Amar, just do it once again. -What? -Your scared face when you saw the gun. -I wasn't scared at all. -Oh, really? When Douglas will honor us, it will be great to see the sulky faces of the whites. They will find it unbelievable. That's not it. There are many Indians at top positions in the UK. That's true. London Mayor, Finance Minister, Home Minister… -The Prime Minister? -All of them are Indians. Lady Sherlock Holmes. Also an Indian, with a bad sense of humor. Lisa, apart from you and me, who else knew that… we are going to my home in Oxford. Everybody knew. I think the killer is getting frustrated now. What do you mean? First, he tried to throw us off… by killing Jared. When that didn't work… he tried to take me down. Okay. What do you think? What's the connection between all these victims? Amar, I think the connection is the style of killing. But the kohl, the black tears. What's your take on that? That bothered me as well. Maybe… to make the victims look ugly. It might be that those women remind him of some bad incident or person. He's trying to make them look like her? And if he's so smart to not leave a clue, it means… he has done this before. That's quite possible, Amar. -You are right. -One… -Just a second. Pull over. -What? Pull over. Please. That's it. Stop here. I'll see you later. -See you. -Bye. See you. Mr. Amar? -Emma. Amar. -Mr. Sam told me about you. -Yeah. -What files are you looking for? I'm looking at cold cases of women, murdered around 15 to 20 years ago. All homo-psycho cases are in section F, rows 17 to 24. Follow me, please. Okay. So, all the homo-psycho cases are just here between 17 and 24. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. I'm really sorry, it's getting late. I need to go get my son from childcare. Okay, Emma. Then… I'll need these files for the night. Okay. Thank you. What are you packing? Roasted chicken and your favorite salad. Thank you. Well, are you going to work today as well? Of course. Like this? In these clothes? This is fashion. So, just chill. Fashion! Anyways, I'm really late. Hey. Come in. Let's have fun. That's what you said. -Right? -What? Why are you wearing all this? To have fun. Fun? Like this? Bend down. -Bend down? Me? -Bend down. -Okay. -Yeah. Bend down! Fun? Have fun. Relax. Yes. Wait. Wait, relax. Here's fun. -It's okay. -No! Olivia! Hey! Out! Hello. Hello, police. How can I help you? There's a break-in. A killer is in the house. Where are you? Clement Road, number 45. That's close, we'll be there in five minutes. Please, stay out of the house. Leave me. I'm short of time. I won't say anything. Do you want a gift? I'll give you a gift of your life. I'm not a moron. Hello, officer. Tell me what happened. Thank you. Fake tears made from mascara are missing. The finger is intact. The position of the neck is the same. Okay. Body position is the same. Whip marks are the same. I think Operation Mayfair Killer did this. But something is wrong. Do we have anyone who has witnessed this? Yes, we have the victim's aunt. -Okay. Where is she? -She is outside. Okay, let's talk to her. I'm really sorry for your loss. -But, we have some questions. -Okay. Why did you come back into the house? Olivia had… packed some lunch for me. I forgot to take the lunch box. I came back for it. What exactly did you see inside? The guy… was whipping… my Olivia. When I saw that… I immediately ran out and called the cops. What did he look like? His head was covered, I couldn't see his face. You might have seen something, right? Height, structure, body movement. Something? You might have noticed something. Hello, Kevin. Where are you? I'm jogging. We have got a fantastic lead. I'm sending the address, get here immediately. This time, the killer had no chance to wipe off the evidence. Are you sure it's the same killer? Yes, I'm. I'll be there in 20 minutes. Excuse me. Lisa. Kevin, the body is inside. -Have a look. -Okay. The team is working on it. It's been submitted. Okay. How long? That's hard to say. Kevin, did you find anything? I have collected the samples. Let's wait for the results. Lisa. There are no CCTV cameras in this area. We need to get the footage from every bus that drove by here when we got the call. The buses here have CCTV cameras installed. Amar? What are you saying? How's this possible? We can get the killer's image from the footage. -It's the only option we have right now. -Let me try. I'll see what I can do. -Kevin, just a moment, please. -I'll go in. So? What do you think? Amar's theory is going to work? Which theory? The bus, CCTV. It will take ages to check the footage. Exactly. We must concentrate on forensic evidence. It's worth the try. What do you think? I still think it's a waste of time. Anyways, see you then. Bye. Amar might be right. No. Try it on the other roads. Check on the other roads. Stop! Zoom in. Yeah. Got him. Amar. We may have found something. What's the time stamp on the footage? 9:23 p.m. And what time did the call come in? Sir, 9:17 p.m. I think this is our guy. Can we have a better angle of this picture? That's the best we can get. Sorry. The pictures are of not much help. The road was dark, and the face was covered with a hood. Dammit! This picture is no good. We can't recognize him, Amar. Just zoom in on the second one. That one. -Hey. -Hi. -One lager, please. -Sure. Charming place around here, mate. Looks like it's your first time here. Yes. Thank you. Hi, I'm Amar. From the Met Police Department. I need some information. So, what do you want to know? The night before last… did you see anyone wandering around here, suspiciously? It's a bloody pub, mate. Everyone here walks around suspiciously, after, should I say, a few drinks. Someone in a black hoodie, maybe. Running away from something? I can't remember. That night… Zena had her hen night here. She's a sweetheart. They made more noises than they had drinks, but, yeah. And you would have Zena's address. Right? -Thank you, my friend. -it was my pleasure. Have the beer. It's on me. Thanks. You're welcome. Good evening, ma'am. -Good evening. -I'm Amar, from the Met Police. What is this about? I'm actually investigating the recent women's murders in London. Is this about the one that killed Sarah Jones? Yeah. Scary! I believe the pictures from your hen night would be really useful to us. My hen night? How do you know about it? Anthony, at the pub, is a friend. Look ma'am, I know, it's… it's a little too much for you, but… could I just have a look at those pictures once? -Please. -Okay. Thank you. Okay. Just this one, please. This one! I need this one! Could you just mail it to me? Please. Yeah. It's okay. Thank you so much. I mean, how could a hit man enter Amar's place with a loaded gun? Is Britain turning into the wild west or something? What's the update? Sir, the team is working on the CCTV footage, to track down the hit man's whereabouts. Sir. This hit man was in my custody a few years ago. I think that's the reason why the killer chose him to go after me. Sir, I think Amar is right. We have closed in a lot on this case. Listen, both of you. I need results. Okay? Now, you have 48 hours before I shut the whole operation down. And DCI Lisa Varma. I have a briefing with the minister in less than two hours. What do we have to show? -I'm working on it, sir. -Sir. We need access to the police's facial recognition database. See this. Where did you get this? A bit of old-school police work, sir. Same body structure! Hoodie. Just like the bus CCTV. He's the same guy. Sir, we need access to the software. We have to take our chances now. -Please, sir. -Alright. I'll put in a word. But, guys, put this on your highest priority. Yes? -Sir. -Yes, sir. And keep me updated on that hit man. -Sure, sir. -Sir. Amar. Did you find anything in the Alexa transcript? Nothing. Just two words. "Boy, moron! Boy, moron!" It was on a loop. Oh, my God! That's weird. Why? What happened? This word irritates Kevin a lot. I mean, the last time when he attended my session… he got frustrated after hearing this word. He got disturbed all of a sudden. Started stammering. He told me something more in that session. He was not on good terms with his stepmother. Since his childhood. I think he's a victim of some sort of trauma. Quite weird. I hope you haven't discussed all this with anyone. Right? Not yet. -And don't. -Amar! I have got the orphanage's address. And, I have also fixed your appointment with the supervisor. Great! -Sonia. -Yes? Get ready. You need to come with me. -Take this. -Okay. -Lisa. -Yes? Keep me updated on the details of the facial recognition. -Okay? -Okay. Mr. Amar Singh, perhaps you are forgetting that I'm your boss. Yes, boss. I'll just need the updates. That's all. Sure. And… call the lab and get the forensic reports… -of all these murders in original. -Why? What happened? Just do it. You'll be surprised. Okay? See you, Lisa. Why are we going to the orphanage? Want some brownies? No, thank you. Weren't we closing in on Kevin? That's no good. We have no evidence against Kevin. Okay. -Hi. -Hi. I'm Amar. This is Sonia. -We're from the Met Police Department. -Hello. Our office must have called you regarding the… killing of the woman and her son who used to reside over here. Yes, I remember the boy very well. I was a junior teacher then. Can you tell us something more about him? Poor child! One time, he goes home and finds his stepmother dead. The trauma must have been very hard to forget. Anything about the boy that stood out? Father, can I have a look at that photo, please? Of course. He came in when he was about 14 years old. Come with me, my son. Who is he? This gentleman is from an orphanage. He has come to take you away. -No, please. -Come. No! Please, no. -No! Please. -Come along, son. -No, I don't wanna go. No! -You'll be alright. No. Please, no! -No. Please, no! -You have to trust me, please. -Don't struggle. -No, please. No! Please! No! I counseled him. But the hate in him was too dark and deep. I could never get the boy out of the abyss. And then… Father, is there anything you want to tell us? Now is the time. He attempted to kill a teacher. Stabbed him with a pencil. The teacher called him a moron. Like his stepmother used to call him. Same words. Knowing how broken he was, we decided not to report the case and send him to a juvenile home. It was a mental health issue. I took it upon myself to help him… to flush out the violence and anger from him. Where can we find him? I'm really sorry. I don't know where he is now. What did Antonio do now? He changed his name to Kevin. And he's under suspicion for killing six innocent women. Murdered exactly the same way his stepmother was. Thank you so much for your help, sir. -Thank you. -We need to move. -I'm taking this picture with me. -Of course. -Thank you. -Thank you. Zoom in, there. Nothing on this one. Spread it wider. -Kevin? -Yeah. -Connect me to the chief lab technician. -Why? Amar feels that there are some issues with the reports. Need to authenticate. He must be out for lunch. -I'll connect him to you this evening. -Sure. Nothing on this one as well. Raise it to Interpol. Interpol search is negative, Lisa. Go civilian. Access all airports, entry ports, and databases. Do it. Then I will require level three clearance. Just do it. I'm sorry, but I haven't been authorized to. Peter, I'll sign for it. Just do it. -The civilian match may take longer. -Fine. Give it to me as fast as you can. I can almost smell the killer. -Lisa. -Yes? I need to tell you something. -Related to the case. Something important. -What? Okay, go ahead. No, not here. I found some major forensic evidence. In Victoria Park, near Olivia's house. Okay, we'll go. Right now, it's time sensitive. I'll brief you on the way. Okay. Send the results in case of any match. Okay? Directly to my phone. -Sure. -Let's go. -Here? -You have arrived at your destination. -You're sure? -Yes, this is the place. Come. Come on. -What happened? -Kevin, just let me call back up. Oh, no. That's not required. Come, I'll show you. Over there. Let's go. Oh, my God! So, first Kevin killed his stepmother. And when he didn't get caught, he became overconfident. He then started killing everyone who resembled his mother. Do you know what this is? Look. The killer sits inside this. Like this. He then takes the solution and… This kills all the dead cells. That's why there were no traces of DNA! He wraps himself with this so nothing falls off. Look at this. Can you recognize this girl? This one? Look at the kohl. See there. Come. Oh, my God! Kevin. You found the killer's hideout! Bloody Kevin! He was in the same office so he could monitor each and every case. That's why he never got caught. Right now, he's a killer on the loose. I know who the killer is. Who? One second. -Hello, Amar. -Lisa, Kevin is the killer. -Hello? -Hello. Hello, Lisa? -Hello? -Lisa, can you hear me? Amar, bad signal. Lisa, where are you? Kevin has found some clues, he brought me here… -Hello, Amar. -Hello. Hello, Lisa? Kevin, give me the phone. You wanted to know who the killer is? Here, you have his photo now. You are the killer? Kevin! Calm down! You know, the police can still track you, right? -I want them to track me. -Kevin, go back. Kevin, stay back. Stay back, please! Sam, can you trace Lisa's phone for me? Where is she? I was also trying her number. It's Kevin. I know she's with Kevin. -Leave me. -Relax! Amar! But if their phones are switched off. Just triangulate the mobile towers, okay? And get me the coordinates, immediately. Stop it, Kevin! Kevin, you have serious trauma issues. You need medical attention. Do you hear me? Why are you venting your anger on these innocent girls? Because of your traumatic memories? Memories? Memories? Memories! What do you know about my memories? Amar. Got it. I'm sending you the coordinates right away. They are in some isolated rail yard. You're quite close. Thanks, Sam. Kevin, please let me go. -I'll speak for you. -Shut up. Have you ever asked me, "Kevin, what's your problem?" You used to sit in front of me, each day. Have you ever asked?! Lisa! You okay? -Lisa! I'll call the ambulance. -Kevin. It's Kevin. I'm fine. Kevin, stop. Kevin! Do you really think you can press charges against me? Will this evidence hold up in court? But Kevin, we have your facial recognition match. I plead insanity. I will need a mental health facility. Let's just say, for seven years. You cannot dictate terms to us. Of course, I can. I'll show your department's failure to the world. I will embarrass the shit out of you. I'll present all these documents in court. Sir. Kevin has serious mental and trauma issues. I think we should send him for medical care. Looks like we have no choice in the matter. Kevin needed medical care from his childhood. It's not too late. Well, the minister doesn't want any scandal. -Not with the election looming. -Yes, sir. We agree to your demands. Thank you. Amar, seven years is just a matter of time. What will you do? For seven years, don't keep wondering how you lost again. Mom! Dad! -Bells. -Yeah, I love bells. -Nice. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome, dear. -I'll go hang these. -Yeah. -Thank you! Your hair looks great. Well, you noticed something after all. Tania, can we make a fresh start? And what about the ghosts from your past? My ghosts? What do you mean? Who's the detective? You or me? -Hi, Amar. -Hello, Sonia. I'm back in Oxford. Oh, really? Sorry, I couldn't say goodbye. There's no need for an explanation. Tania is happy. Alishka is also happy. Are you planning to join the force again? I have no such plans. I'm happy where I am. Daddy! Daddy! Sonia. You need to move on. I understand. Take care. -You too. -Bye. Bye. -Can I join you on the tours? -Of course. -But on one condition. -What? -You have to speak in Hindi. Okay? -Okay. Yes. -Promise? -Promise. Good girl. Do you need anything else? You remind me of my stepmother. I'll give you the best gift of your life after seven years.
