Have another go. What are you gonna do this time? Come on, Bobby, have a go! Have a go! Hey? Bobby? You think about this, all right? Is that it? Hey, is that it? I got a little surprise for you, Bobby. A little surprise. Come with me. - Why did you invite him? - Well, did I know any of this shit was gonna happen? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I fucked up. I'm sorry, Sam. - No. He's just angry. He's angry, right? What the fuck is he doing here? - I'm gonna go and talk to him. - You okay? - Yep. - Lock the door. - Now, Bobby, in fishing terms, you're what we call the bait. - All right, stop, bull. Just stop, yeah? - Stop? Stop the boat? And drop the anchor? Is that what you want me to do? - No. - Eh? 'Cause, you know, bit of trouble, you know? - Please stop. - Doing all right, Bobby? Eh? All right? - Bull. - Toobs. Help. - Oh, shut up, you Metro-fucking-sexual. - Can we talk about this, please, mate? - I think it's a little bit late for that, Toobsy. - Ugh! - Sam! Sam, out you come! - She's not coming out. - Toobsy, don't worry, mate. I'm not gonna kill him. Okay? Just gonna finish up what she started, then everything will be rosy. All right? ♪♪ - You silly bugger! It really hurts, all of that. Get up here! I don't have a problem with you, okay, Toobsy? But listen, why don't you tottle off back downstairs... - Ah! Ah! Ah! - Thanks, Toobsy. - It's me. - Oh, my god. - He just wants Sam. - Well, that's not gonna happen, so... - I'm so sorry, guys. - No, Sam, this is not your fault. Look, we just have to get off this boat. - What if we can get to Archie's canoe? - Great. - We've been traveling for hours out to sea. Where are you gonna go? - Well, we'll go anywhere. We'll just... we'll get off the boat when it's dark. Yeah? - I can't leave Rob. - Oi, you're back. - Of course I'm back, Archie. - How? - You let the ocean work for you. Huh? Pulls you in and then pulls you back out. Silly buggers. They left me bored on the beach. - Where is everyone? - Toobsy and the girls are just relaxing. Bobby's hanging around. - And skip? Skippy... - Probably just dropped in on someone. You have a big night, Grummy? - Nah. - They all yours? - Yeah. Look at ya. Hey, want to do me a favor? Come take the wheel. Not too drunk, are you? - No. - Good boy. You look like you're getting a little bit of sun there, Bobby. You need a bit of protection. Here, let me do your back for you, mate. That feel good? I know it does. Bloody safe now, aren't you? Eh? I'd hate to have anything happen to you, Bobby. Come on, Archie. What are you doing, mate? - Look, I was thinking, maybe if you... - Archie, mate, I was thinking that maybe you should do what I asked you to do, which was clean up the table, please, mate. You made that mess. What, are you getting drunk again, are you? - I'm not getting drunk, mate. I'm just trying to clean up. - Where are all the sharp knives? Hey? - Bull, it's not too late to go back. - Come on, mate. You saw how she played us all, eh? - What happened on the beach? - A little fight. It's like that, Grummy. Now, I've seen it on the cooking shows... Take all the flesh out, clean it all up, whack it back in. Bloody marvelous. Grum. Want to taste some? - No. - No? It's sashimi. Sam's favorite. Make sure I get all the scales out, though. Eh? That's the key. She's gonna love it, isn't she? Oh, look at that. Sashimi aplenty. Hey, Bobby. You know I said I would hate anything to happen to you. Oh, I was bullshitting. - No! No! Stop! You silly bugger! Bobby, you can't go up and over, Bobby! - Oh! - Grab here, mate. Let me come over. Come on, I'll give you a hand. Jumped the queue, mate. Eh? You little snake. You know the rules. Rules of the water. Bingo. I've made us dinner. So... Come on. All right. And, Sam, you can leave the bug spray behind this time. My little joke. I'd hate for this to, you know, get spoiled, so... Come on. Oh. What a pleasant surprise. Now, as you'll see, I run a very tight ship. Except for you, Sam. Now, our little friend here... Eh, there he is. Look at him, enjoying the sunset. He's gonna stay right where he is. Okay? If there's any sign of mutiny, well... - Ah! - Toobs! - Come on, let's eat. Alex? Come on, let's go. Toobsy, what are you doing, mate? What are you doing? - Help. Hey. Let's make this special. This is gonna be nice. Now, everybody's got a little name tag. Toobsy, I think you're over there, mate. Go and have a little squeeze at your card, name card. Look at this, eh? Class, Archie. Look at this, Sam. Hmm? I know, a little surprise for you. Well, now, Sam, I know that you love sashimi, so... Hmm? Hmm? Have a bit of bloody sashimi. Look at that. Eh? Eh, isn't this nice? Huh? Candles? Hey, Alex, I had no idea that you were such a good doco maker. Hmm? Be proud of her, Toobsy. I particularly liked one little sequence that you had. - Fuck! - Is that you, Toobsy? Eh? Recognize that? Hey? Look at that. That's bloody wild. Listen to that. That's hot, that is. Eh, look at that. Eh? Have a look, Sam. Look at that. Yeah. Grummy, have a look, mate. Have a look. She's very talented. You're very talented. Lover. Listen to that. Hmm? What, did you think you were alone? Hey, Alex... You love Toobs? - You've got to stop this. - Sorry, did I ask you to speak, Toobs? Did I? I'll tell you what, mate. How about, um, you shut the fuck up, okay? I swear to god, you shut the fuck up because I will fuck you up. Show me, then. - What? - Come on. Give him a kiss. Come on. Come on. Come here. Come here. Look out. Look out, big fella, eh? Hey, come here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Kiss him. On the lips. On the lips. On the lips, lips, lips. That's nice, that is. That's nice. There you go. Eh? Beautiful. Hey? Oh... That's bloody lovely, that is. Eh? Eh? Got to love a double date, don't you? Hmm? Look at those two. Sam, look at those two. Hmm? Look at them. Look at them. Hey, get a bloody room. Get a room, you two. Hey, Sam, I know we've only been together a couple of days... The party's just begun. You don't want to go home yet, do you? Eh? Do you, Sam? You know, there are certain lessons in life that everyone has to learn. This is your one. Bobby will get over it. Oh, shit. Bobby. Hey, Bobby baby! You all right down there, buddy? Hey, no, what the fucking hell are you doing, Toobs? Sit the fuck down! Shut up and sit down! Sorry, mate. Just getting a little bit carried away in here. But hang in there! Eh? Hang in there. Having a little joke. Come on. Eh? - Hey, Alex. You know what would be romantic? You could shoot us at it. Huh? Be a good bit for the doco. You see, that's what surf vids are lacking these days, I think. A little bit of bloody depth. - How about... How about we do a little bit of something now? Like, you just... We could do a bit of it, an intro sort of, you know? We could do a bit of one-on-one, but you have to sit over here, and then I can... I could get a single of you, and we can do a bit of... An interview? How do you feel about that? - Great. Great. Here you go. This is why... eh? Here's your camera here. Yep. What are you like, bloody... Bloody Parkinson? Eh? Ladies and gentlemen, my next guest is the bull. Come on down. Let's do it. How do I look, Grummy? Grummy? Archie? How do I look? - Good. - Good? Hey, Sam. Sam. Sam. How do I look?

I'm gonna sound like a bloody wanker. - No, you won't. - You've got ask somebody else. Ask Archie. Ask the Grum. Archie? - I don't know. Surfing stuff. - Yeah, and? That was hopeless, mate. That was hopeless. - Have you won... You must have won heaps of competitions, right? - No. - What do you mean? - I don't compete, Alex. - So you've never won. - No. Heck... oh, does... You can't lose if there's no bloody competition. - Do you have many friends, bull? - I've got fucking heaps of friends. Look around. - Fuck, man, what do you want from us? - I get upset, Alex. I don't want anything from us. It's not from us. Okay? I just want Sam. Hey, Sam. Would you trust me? - Alex, get your camera. Come on, Alex. Come on. Come on, sweetheart.
