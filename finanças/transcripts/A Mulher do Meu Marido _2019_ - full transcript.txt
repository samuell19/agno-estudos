Come on! Get out of the way! What a drag. Move it. Jesus! Get out of the way! You're insane! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. - Sexist pig! - Jealousy doesn't suit you. - Hurry! - Relax! Dial it down. Do you want me to get a ticket? Why are you freaking out? Has the world gone nuts? You're one to talk. Let's go. - Are you sure you want to do it? - If we get there on time, sure. - Should I step on it? - No, let's get there alive. Does everyone have their insect repellent? - Yes. - First stop, half an hour. I can't believe it, Carla. The jeep's gone. They've left. Just ask someone. They're probably still here. No, they were leaving at 9:00 am. It's 9:30. The jeep's gone. This isn't the UK. People come late. Half an hour late in Rio is British punctuality. They… They went to Leblon. Can't you just send a text? This is the stop I was talking about. From here you can admire the Leblon beach. Then you have Copacabana, Ipanema. Last stop is the favelas. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I talk to you a second? - Are you in my group? Actually, I might belong to a more exclusive group. I'm busy right now. If you'd like to schedule a trip, this has all the info you need. Any questions, call our headquarters. They'll help you out. Yes, but only you can give me the info I need. - Do we know each other? - Not personally. Joana Camargo, Dr. Pedro's wife. - Stay away from me. - Relax. Everything's okay. I won't make a scene. I just wanted to talk to you about something, but it might be better to speak a little quieter. Do you think you could go back to being my husband's mistress? Please? You must be confused. - I'm married. - Same. But I know you still love my husband. Your… Well, I think you understand. He loves you, as well. You don't need to worry about Martin. - I'll take care of that. - You know my husband? Hi, Pedro. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. - Baby girl. - Hi. - Is everything all right? - I'm fine. You sure? - You're not eating? - Not today. Is it me or is there something wrong with him? It's just you. ONE YEAR AGO - Morning. - Morning. Morning. See you later. Aren't you eating? I'll eat when I come back from the office. Is it me or is there something wrong with him? It's just you, baby. I didn't want to talk about it, but… - Dad's having an affair. - What are you talking about? - Lay off the soap operas. - He went running with perfume on. Soap operas aren't good for your brain, Paula. - He's running. - About time. He was a couch potato all his life. Now, at the age of 44, he decides to run every day. Isn't it strange? How many times have you heard me ask him to exercise? - Why are you like this? - Why are you? - Why are you always so unhappy? - I'd be happier if he weren't cheating. You always complained that he was a dope who'd watch TV all day. Do you want that for him again? - A fat couch potato? - I get it. If he's cheating but has a six-pack, it's all good. Why are you obsessing about cheating? - Are you reading Nelson Rodrigues? - Who? - Bye. Send the exam via email. - I will. Send the next patient in, please. - Hi. - Hi. Put the gown on and get on the scale. Here's her file, Dr. Pedro. Weigh the patient, Ms. Rosa. Get on the scale, please. She's at 114 pounds. You're losing weight, Pilar? - A little. - Six pounds. What happened? I'm in love. I'm sorry, Dr. Pedro. - Will you be doing preventive? - No, just routine. - Will you still be needing me? - No, ma'am. In that case, I need to answer the phone. Lay down. Thank you. I'll wait. Thank you so much. - Gabriela. - Finally. You haven't paid yet. - Just the appointment? - Yes. Pasta? With parsley and tomatoes. - Don't you like it? - I do. Was it a bad choice? Don't worry. It's okay. - Say it. - You know I don't eat gluten, Pilar. Since when? I've told you a thousand times. You seem to be a little confused. You're forgetting stuff. I need to get leaner and gain muscle mass. - What idiocy is that? - It's not. It makes no sense to train hard, but eat badly. Listen, I'm the woman in this household. I should be the one concerned about gluten. But I haven't let myself go, have I? Are those new panties? Let me see them. - Stop. - Let me see them, come on. Let me see them. Come on. - What's wrong with you? - Not now. Yes, now. Now. We need to wait five days. We'll go again in five days. You won't run out. - I don't feel like it! - You don't? - I don't! - You don't? We only screw around when you feel like it? - I really don't understand. - You also don't feel like it. I don't? I've been holding off like crazy. I can't take it anymore. You drive me insane! Well, you have a nutsack for a brain, that's what. You're insane! - Where are you going? - Out to eat. Martin, wait. Hey there, girlfriend! Isn't it nice here? - I can see you don't like it here. - Is it that obvious? - Relax. What are you having? - A scotch. Do you have any scotch? - On ice? - No, cowboy. That one was hot. - See? It's nice here. - You're behaving like a teenager. You need a little more than a pretty face for someone to fall for you. Christ on a cracker, I take that back. Friend… - That's my drink. - Sorry. - Good evening. - Good evening. - I'm Martin. - Pleasure. - Carla. - Did you see that? - Argentinian? - That's obvious. - Yes. - I knew it! - Excuse me? I didn't get that. - You're abnormally handsome. - What? - Well, the accent as well. I was referring to your accent. - I'm married. - What a coincidence. Me too. - Excuse me. - I'm divorced. - So, there are no problems here. - I'll leave you alone. Have a good evening. - Seriously, Joana? You spooked him! - You're acting like a crazy person. Like you're desperate. Do you think that's hot? - I am desperate. What about it? - Weren't we going to have a serious talk? - Get this, Paula called me. - I know what that's about. Don't you think she's way too jealous? - I should send her to therapy. - Is it true? - Yes. - Really? - You know where I'm getting at? - About Pedro's affair. I didn't have a PI follow him, but it's pretty obvious. - How are you holding up? - Fine. - Fine? - Yeah. Come on, I know you're not that cold. That has nothing to do with it. I love Pedro. But he's changed. - Aren't you jealous? - I am. - But it turns me on. - Would you look at that? Knowing he's banging another woman gets you off? The sex improved a lot. It's not like I'm not hurt. I actually cried a little at first. You? Crying? But then, I noticed that it all changed for the better. Aren't you afraid that he leaves you? - That's not a possibility. - What if he falls for her? He's already fallen for her, but I know him. He wouldn't leave his family. I see. I've done the math and came to a brilliant conclusion. - You have nothing to lose. - Exactly, girlfriend. It's all good. Look at that. He's handsome and cheeky. He got here after us and he's already seated. It's easier for one. It's the same table. What kind of math is that? - Are you going to make a scene? - It's our table. Excuse us. - Sorry, but we've been waiting for longer. - Sorry, I didn't mean to. Enjoy, sir. Thank you. - I can have a seat at the counter. - Please, no. That's horrible. His food is here. We'll wait. If you want, we can eat together. We'd like that, right? - If your husband is okay with it. - He's okay with it. Let's have a seat, here. And I'll sit here. You're so kind. Thank you. Our drinks. "I'd better go, right?" He won't even notice. I want to see you move your pelvis Here and there Here and there I want to see you move - What's that, Dad? - Matheus VK. Haven't you heard of? Hi, babe. Sure. We need to pick up Clóvis. He's on foot. Negative. Give me the phone. Clóvis, would it be too bad if you called a taxi? Great. Thank you. Sorry, babe. Bye! Here and there I want to see you move I want to see you move your pelvis Here… Hi, how are you? - Fine, you? - Great. - You're beautiful. - Thanks. - I'm so glad you came. - A quick cup of coffee with you. - Beer? - No, not beer. I still have to go back to work. That's a shame. A cold beer would feel nice. - Two cups of coffee, please. - Maybe we can have those beers. Or a glass of wine? Malbec. Argentinian. Think fast. - What's up? - I'm cool, thanks. Give me back my ball. Listen to your father. You can do much better than him. Is that what you're doing? - What is? - Your mistress is an upgrade? - Don't you dare, Paula. Come here. - Let go! - What's going on? - Mind your own business! - Dr. Pedro is having an affair. - Stop that! Those are serious accusations made in thoughtless fashion! - What a screw-up. - Shut it, brat! - You're hurting me. - That's what you get! - Great. - Let go or I'll never speak to you again. Good, you just talk shit. Are you insane? See? I told you, a coward. I told you. May that be a lesson to you. Hey. Everything's fine. I had a small setback. I'm on my way. You too. - It's my patient. I have to go. - Patient. You have no shame. I'm coming with you. I'm delivering a baby. - Stop being paranoid. - Then, why can't I come? - Yeah? - Hi, how are you? - Good, you? - Same. My battery is running out. I'm coming home a bit later. I'll see you at home. I have a lot of work to do. Okay, it's all right. - Love you. - Bye. - Let's go somewhere else. - I need to go home. - I drank too much to go back to work. - So soon? It's still early. We don't even know each other that well. Well, how about another glass of wine so we can do that? I need to get in there. You're staying here. That's okay. I'll wait out here. - Excuse me. - Dr. Pedro? I wanted to check on you. How are you feeling? - How are you, ma'am? - Great, thank you. - How's the pressure? - The nurse said it was fine. Why? Do you know something I don't? No, everything's fine. I just like to check on things. Best to err on the side of caution. - Isn't he a wonderful doctor? - He is. Wouldn't it be great if all doctors were thoughtful like you? - Right? - Yes. - Thank you, Dr. Pedro. - You're welcome. I'll be going. I can't believe I have you. You're beautiful. Beautiful. Easy. We'd better have another glass of wine. I'm not ready. Yes, you are. Where are you going? - To her room. - No way. Look at the time. - It stopped. - It's late. Paula wakes up early. She studies. Fine, then, Dr. Pedro. I'll… I'll see ya. - Bye, babe. - Sorry. Leave. Take care. You're so rude to him. Do you really have to be? - That guy has no future. - How do you know? - Are you psychic? - I don't need to be. I don't need to be psychic to see he won't amount to anything. At most, maybe a street juggler. He is a juggler. Is something wrong with that? - Dear God, my daughter is dating a bum. - Bum? He's an artist. Respect that. Chico Buarque's an artist. - Clóvis is a… - Clown! - Say it. That's what he is. - His jokes are the worst! - It'd be funny if it weren't so sad. - Because he's poor. It's not because he's poor, it's because he'll never stop being poor. His job is beautiful. He brings joy to people. Doesn't that count? So many nice and tidy guys out there and you fell for a clown. You better get used to it, Dad. - We're in a serious relationship. - With a clown? Sorry, dear, but that's a logical contradiction. - That's not natural. - Like your affair? Do you think that's what granddad wanted for Mom? Money isn't everything. Clóvis is way more decent than you are. 10 MISSED CALLS Hi, I'm here. I'm waiting in our room. Hurry. I miss you so much. Pedro, where are you? I've been waiting for half an hour. You're ridiculous. Don't bother calling back. You're home already, Pedro? - I am. You too? - Yeah. That's great. How are things? - Same old, same old. And you? - I'm fine. - Are you all right? - I'm a bit tired. - You seem different. - Different? How? You're pretty. - Am I usually not pretty? - You look younger. Did you do something to your hair, was that it? Yes, I got my hair done. - It looks great. - Thank you, Pedro. Honey! Hey there, dear. Is everything okay? - With me? Where were you? - At the hairdresser. I was getting my hair done. - Your hair looks the same. - What's this about, Paula? Even your father noticed. - Yeah, it looks great. - What did you do to your hair? A cauterization. - Paula… - I don't see the difference. Your hair is dry. Why are you being so negative? What's wrong with her? Feel her hair, Dad. - Spot the difference. - That's ridiculous. - Isn't it great? - It's a lot more… … cauterized. My hypoglycemia must be off the charts. - Have you eaten? - No, we were waiting for you. I'm not hungry at all, dear. I'm going to take a bath. Excuse me. I'm not hungry either. - Who was it? - I don't know. Again. - Probably the wrong number. - I'll get it. - Yes? - Finally. I thought you were mad at me. You have the wrong number, sir. - You can't talk now, right? - Exactly. - That number. - Call me when you can. - I miss you. - Same. - See? Wrong number. - Was it? I forgot. I can't go to the movies today. I need to catch up with my tennis classes. - Okay. - Really? Are you going to the hotel? - You sure? - Yeah. All right. I'm going shopping. Okay. Hi, good afternoon. - I'm Joana's daughter. Is she here? - Yes. - Come with me. - Thanks. You're welcome. Abstraction gives us leeway to propose interaction. When people make their own art, even virtually, it's incredible. Taking this briefing into account, I'd like us to… Seeing as we will have leftovers at the exhibition. What if we… … have a brainstorming session? Joana. You're so beautiful. Why don't we forget all this and have a cup of coffee? Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt, but Ms. Joana's daughter is here. Joana… Paula's outside. - Paula's here? - She's outside. Excuse me. What is it, Paula? Do you want to give me a heart attack? I went to Dad's office to grab some money, but he wasn't there. And he won't answer his phone. And Ms. Rosa almost choked to death trying to explain his absence. Dr. Pedro's not in. He went to… No, he went to… To the… He went to… He went to… Paula, your father's an obstetrician. He must be at the hospital. That's what I told her. When you want to cover for my dad, it's easy. Just say he's at the hospital. That's probably what happened, dear. - Then why was she choking? - How should I know? Maybe she was having a stroke or a heart attack. I don't know. - If I were you, I'd get a PI on him. - Why me? You're going to therapy, kid. What did you want from him? Cash. - I have a party, remember? - Another one? - Whose party? - Maria's. - Is that boy going with you? - Of course. - He drove me here. - I don't like it when he does that. - Why? He's my boyfriend. - We don't know him. - We get nervous. - That doesn't make sense. I can date him, but I can't be in a car with him? I'll explain it to you. If I forbid you to date him, will that be of any use? Take that for sense. I don't want to leave. What if we spent the weekend here? You have your family and I have Martin. Don't worry. You'll still be a family. Are you sure? What I most want is to have a child. When do you… - When does your… - In two days. Martin and you have a lot of work ahead of you. Shall we go? Pedro? Are you upset with me? Of course not. Why would I be? He's not picking up. He must have his face stuffed between some woman's legs. He must be in a consultation or something. I'm sure he's deceiving me. - Deceiving? - He's lying to me. That's your mother's problem, not yours. Poor woman, my mom is so naïve. A table is freeing up Do you want to sit? Take it easy. There's a girl ahead of us. What's the serious thing you were going to tell me? - It's good news. - You found out his mistress is ugly. Are you insane? Is it a man? Is she Black? - Talk to me! I need to know! - I was in a hotel with Martin. - You debauchee. - Quiet down. God, you're so bad. You have no idea. It was so good, you know? I gotta say, I've been single for years and you have a husband and a lover. That's how it is. How come? - Am I ugly? Be honest. - Come on, it has nothing to do with you. - You're right. Sorry. - But I can't be with him anymore. You're going to bail on that Greek God? - Is that it? - I am. - Yeah, right. - You don't believe me? Not a bit. I'm willing to bet money you wouldn't. - Is that a dare? You'll see. - All right. Do you think it's a good idea? I just know I have to see that gringo today. - Men don't like annoying women, dear. - Since when do you know what men like? Well, I'm talking from experience. I'm clingy. Look at my shitty situation. That gringo is mine today. Only mine. Come on. - You were saying? - Jesus Christ. Come on. - Let's leave while we still can. - Relax, I know what I'm doing. Well, yeah… Better to share something good than to eat crap alone. Of course. - Does that mean I'm in? - Don't push your luck. So selfish. He's not here. I knew it. - He must be in another hospital. - There are no more hospitals. We just checked all there are. Can we go to the party now? Ladies and misses, who's next? I think that's me. How are you? Fine. He used to leave the key here. Move. It might be here. Damn. Have you used this? My Dad's chair? Of course not. Disgusting. We could play doctor for a while. There goes my sex on the beach. Don't worry. I can make as many as you want. I like that. You don't have the right to be upset because I want to have a baby. I'm not upset. - That's ridiculous. - You have your family… That's right. I have mine and you'll have yours. We'll each mind our own lives, right? - Why are you acting like that? - Give me a break, Pilar. It's bad enough arguing at home. - I'm not in this for that. - Then why are you in this? - Tell me. - I don't know. To have fun, so I don't die of boredom. For the same reasons you are. I get it. - Drop me off here, please. - I'll drive you home. - No need. - I insist. I insist you drop me off here. - Are you going to make a scene? - Stop the car. I'm also not in this to argue. I have a husband for that. Come here! - Cover for me, okay? - Again? Yeah, but this time it's different. - Thanks. - You'll tell me all about it. Like I said, it's different this time. Babe. - Are you leaving? - Me? Yes. No, of course not. - Then why were you leaving? - I was going to have a smoke. A smoke? Yes, cigarettes. Smoke. Great, I think I need it as well. No, what if you're pregnant? Tough luck. What? Take it easy. You can't smoke out there. - Do it here. - Well, hand me one. - Okay, relax. - Okay. Jesus Christ. What do you think? - I don't know. It's kinda small. - Small? I think it's quite big. I've never done it. How would I know? We'll take it easy. It can be hard on you. It's too thick. - Hurry up. - Nervous? A bit. You'll love it. It's great. Is it good? I thought my first time would be bad, but it's good. What a coincidence having you here. Yeah, it is. - What were you doing here? - I was visiting a patient. - Which one? - The hypochondriac. The hypochondriac? Hasn't she given birth already? It'll be a while for that. She's been impossible. She keeps saying she's dying. - She's really annoying. - Wait up. From what I can tell, she's been pregnant for 14 months? - Is it from the clinic? - Yes? I know. What? Ms. Rosa, stop coughing, for God's sake. What was that? - What? - What was that about? What's wrong? Are you insane? I'm very disappointed in you. - Very. - I'm sorry. How could you do that in my office? - Stop laughing, Paula. - I can't. - I'm telling you to stop. - That was awful! What did I do to deserve this? - All this because of a little joint? - Shut up! You don't have the right to open your trap in my office. What did you say? Repeat that. Don't, everything you say will be used against you. What did you do with her? - Nothing. - You'll talk here… … or at the police station. All right, I confess. We were smoking some weed. Was that it? - What else did you do? - Nothing. Don't lie to me. Ms. Rosa told me everything. - What did you hear, Ms. Rosa? - Don't bring me into it, please. She heard you having sex. - Damn! - She heard us having sex? - Was that what you heard? - No, I didn't say that. I didn't hear that. That's not how it was. Pedro, Ms. Rosa said she heard them saying "first time". It was my first time smoking weed. That's all it was. Wait. You thought I was going to have sex in your office? That's disgusting. - Are you crying? - Relax, Pedro. - Relax, darling. It was just a mix-up. - And I'm the clown. Ms. Rosa. It was a mix-up. Come on, let's go. Dr. Pedro's office, good afternoon. Cancel all my appointments for today. I'm sorry, ladies. I have to go to the hospital. Paula, make sure to lock up properly. Hold, please. Dad, wait! HI, DARLING. SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING. I HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH MY DAUGHTER. I REALLY WANT TO BE WITH YOU LATER. LOVE YOU. Come on. One more set and I'll go. You said that half an hour ago. I'm coming. - Can't you interrupt that for a while? - I'm almost done. You don't seem to realize how important this is to me. Yes, I know. Half an hour won't make a difference. I'm coming. Let's take this off. Could you help? I can't do it alone. Can you relax, please? You'll never get pregnant like that. You're sabotaging this. Stop playing the victim. Okay, I fucked up, but could you wait up? - Babe? - I'm not a babe! Nor yours, ever. Pilar, come up! We have to make a baby! - You're ridiculous! - Ridiculous? Don't blame me later, then! What are you looking at? Never seen a guy in his undies? Not one that hot. I gotta take it easy. - What's wrong? You didn't like it? - I'm not feeling right. You want some tapioca? Thanks, but nothing I eat will make me feel right. - Having a hard time? - Yeah, a bit. I have a bomb to drop on you. I met the other. What other? - How? Where? - On that day I went to the hotel bar. How? Didn't you go out with Martin that day? I was going to, until his wife arrived. - Did she find out about you? - No, it went fine. I think I made a mistake. Wait, don't change the subject. You were talking about Pedro's mistress and changed the subject. - I didn't. - Sure you did. - You began talking about his… - They're the same person. - What? - Get it? What are the odds of that ever happening? - I don't get it. - Do you know what's worse? - It gets worse? - It does. I feel jealous of him. I heard him calling her name and felt a stab in my chest. Oh, dear… Wait a second. Does Martin know his wife's two-timing him? It's too hot, Martin. Martin, what would you do if you found out your wife was having an affair? What kind of question is that? - Pilar would never do that. - She's pretty. I saw her at the hotel. She's really something. You saw her? - Is she good in bed? - She is. She's good. In her own way, but… She's a bit shy, maybe… Am I better than her? You're incredible, Joana. You rock me like a hurricane. Pilar is sweeter. Do you make her come? I do. Every time. Now and then, but I do. You never questioned whether she is faithful? Of course not. - She's not that kind of woman. - That kind? - What kind? Mine? - Yeah, like yours. No, what I meant was… You're a strong woman. Pilar is a delicate woman. She only cares about family. She just wants to have children and all that. Sex isn't a priority for her. If it was, maybe she'd have a child. She has trouble getting pregnant. - She's getting treatment. - I thought as much. - How so? - It's nothing. Do you think she'd never leave you for another man? Of course not! What's with all this serious talk? Quit it. Why are you so interested in my wife's fidelity? It's nothing. Just joking. I found out my husband's having an affair. With my wife? Could you picture that? - Imagine that. - That'd be quite ironic. Funny, yeah. - Are you sad? - No… I'm just… I felt a huge blow when I found out. - But it's okay now. - Joana… Men are like that. We weren't made for monogamy. But that doesn't mean he doesn't love you. You're so sweet. You'll become an interesting man if you grow up on time. - Morning. New secretary? - It's temporary. - What happened to Ms. Rosa? - Nothing really. A nervous breakdown. - A nervous breakdown? - She became hysteric. Nothing much. She's got panic syndrome. Anyway, nothing really. Just wait a little while. Okay, thanks. - Morning. - Morning. Do you have an opening? Is it an emergency? It is, but I can come back another time. I'll see if he can see you. - Insurance? - Out-of-pocket. - Out-of-pocket. Your name? - Pilar Suanes. Dad? There's a patient here that wants to see you bad. Out-of-pocket and it's an emergency. Her name is Pilar Suanes. All right. Wait a moment. Are you pregnant as well? She's carrying triplets. Dr. Pedro took care of my treatment. He's great. I'm also pregnant, but it doesn't show yet. Just a little more hip, but I'm only carrying one. It's a boy. My husband really wanted a girl. I'll try for that later. I've let Dr. Pedro know. He better get ready, because I'll be back. Are you going through treatment? I am. - I think I've seen you here before. - Yeah, I think so too. - You're Argentinian, right? - Yes. You came specifically because of Dr. Pedro? We've been living here for a few years. My husband and I. I see. Because I know of a few cases. I've heard about people that fly here. He's known worldwide. I had lost hope, but thank God I met Dr. Pedro. You can relax. You'll soon be pregnant as well. The big question now are the names. If it's a boy, it'll be Miguel. But if it's a girl… My husband likes Júlia and Elisa. But I prefer Isabel and Mariana. - I also like Helena. - Isabel and Helena, for sure, right? They're all very beautiful. - What's going on? - Must be an emergency. - She's not pregnant. - It's another kind of emergency. Another kind? What other kind of emergency someone who's not pregnant can have that's more pressing than triplets? I can't say, ma'am. It would be unethical of me. I just met your daughter. What a mess. What's she doing here? She's grounded. Forced labor. The sentence's one month. Or until Ms. Rosa comes back. I think she knows. I didn't know you were coming. You fight with me, disappear, and then show up out of thin air? - You're a bit crazy, aren't you? - Me? - What about you? - I'm mad… … for you. I want to stop the treatment. It's hurting me. My marriage is over. I don't want a child from a broken marriage. If you want, we can interrupt the treatment. - Did you speak to him about it? - He doesn't care. That's one of the reasons I want this. - What are the others? - Actually… - There's only one other. - What is it? - I think you know. - I want you to tell me what it is. You first. - I need to be sure. - Well, I need the same thing. - I'm sure. - Of what? - You know of what. - Tell me. We love each other, right? We do. Your pulse is… … is great, normal. Quite the emergency. Who gave you permission to burst in here? Can't you see I'm with a patient? You're not going to destroy our family, just because you don't have one. - Go after her, Pedro. - I can't. Forgive me, I… - I can't. - Why? Go speak to your daughter. I can't tear my family apart. I simply can't. Their happiness matters more to me than my own. I don't know if you'll understand, or forgive me. Do you want me to send in the next patient? Dr. Pedro's office. Good afternoon. No, we're not scheduling any appointments for now. I know you called last month, but he's not back yet. I don't know when he'll be back. Dr. Bianca is covering for him. Do you… I know. He's unreplaceable. No, he's not in a conference, he took a… Just a moment, please. He took some time off to take care of private affairs. - Where are you going? - To take a walk. - Is it morning yet? - It's almost 6:00 p.m. - You're going alone? - Do I have a choice? I can come with you, but I… I'd rather stay here, if that's okay with you. Don't look at me like that. I told you this hotel depresses me. It's full of Argentinians. Since when do you have a problem with Argentinians? I don't. It's their accent. That… … manner of speaking. It makes me very sad. You've been sad for a while. I don't know how to help you anymore. I'll go to the front desk and check us out. We'll leave tomorrow. It'll be better. I want you to have fun. - If you can, of course. - I just want my vacation to end. I'll get better. This medication isn't working. You should attend to the root of your depression. - Medication alone isn't enough. - What root? My life is great. I love my wife and I have a beautiful daughter. I'm successful, I love my work. We can give up on our desires, Pedro, but our desires don't give up on us. I'm going for a walk. Get some rest. - Hi, how's it going? - Fine, you? - Are we in the same hotel? - Yes, we are. - Am I bothering you? Are you alone? - No, please. Have a seat. Thank you. - António. Pleasure. - Joana. - Cheers. - Cheers. Someone left her husband at home, right? Actually, I left him at the hotel. That's strange. I've seen you around, but always by yourself. Yeah… My husband is keeping to our room. I, on the other hand… - I saw you with someone. - She's my sister. Her husband left her for another woman. He went around the world with her. Now I have to raise a very sad sister's spirits. - Are you divorced? - I never married. Look here. I won't fall for that one. You're gay? I don't believe in marriage. It's not natural. We weren't born for it. Right… You think men exist to spread their seed around, right? It's a good evolutionist excuse for adultery. I'm that guy who doesn't conform to the norm. That guy who's not cowardly enough to stay locked inside a marital cage. - I'm that guy… - António, but… It's not that bad. A marriage contract should last for two years, renewable every two years. We could pick a less controversial topic. - What about religion… Soccer! - However, I admit. There's something I admire. - Only one? - One. - Let's not exaggerate. - We found it. That luxurious practice. It's delicious. Only a married person can taste it. The good old honeymoon. Extramarital romance, isn't it? It's that simple. Jesus… Hi, dear. - Weren't you only coming back Monday? - Your father wasn't having fun. - I know what kind of fun he likes. - Be quiet. - Can't you see how he is? - How can you defend him that blindly? Because you don't know anything about life. It's hard being an adult, married, having teenage kids. I'm on your side. We're a family. Everyone's on the same side. Your father is making a big sacrifice for our sake. Actually, for your sake. If he's still here, it's not because he's comfortable. It's because he doesn't want us out of our comfort zone. Do me a favor, Paula. Respect and be kind to him. Were you afraid of spending the night alone? No, Dad. I'm a big girl. - You slept alone, right? - No, Maria kept me company. Did that kid take advantage of that? I broke up with him. - You did? - Yes! If I had known you were coming back today, I'd have prepared the champagne. Poor kid. He loved you. You know who I'm talking about, right? Clóvis. That guy you called a clown. The one who broke into your office and gave me weed for the first and last time. Have you considered that everything he did was to impress you? You don't know how men get when they're in love. Poor sod. Hi! - Do you want to scare me to death? - No, girlfriend. I wanted to invite you to some drinks. Yes, I deserve that. I need a bit of happiness. But I've already got a date. - With Martin? - He insisted and I accepted. I'm setting things right. I need a clean slate in my life. Two men who're into you like dogs with a bone. Most women would love to have your problems. Pedro's the problem now. He's such a drag. Why don't you divorce him to be with Martin? Because I don't want him. You don't? He's hot and it seems he loves you. He loves sex and himself. Two things I have in common with him. Throw him my way, then. I don't know if you're that into yourself. Yeah, I don't know. But I do like him. - He's married. - With an unfaithful woman. - Jesus… - No, listen… You're my friend. It doesn't count. - He's here. - Good luck, darling. Just a little remark. You do know that the scarf and sunglasses attract attention, right? I feel invisible with them. They work. I see. Whatever floats your boat. Hi, Martin. - Hi. - What happened to your face? Nothing, I went to a peeling session. Cool, right? - Peeling? - Yeah. I went with the chemical one. The crystal one didn't work out. Don't worry. After it peels off, it'll be great. It'll be… It'll be soft, smooth. - Damn! - What happened? I'm late to the party. Mom was taking me, but she's not here. I'll have to call a taxi. I'll drive you there. You will? You know that you'll have to get up from there, right? I'll go change. Give me two minutes. Change? - Can I turn off the TV? - Yes. Did you change medication? - Whose party is it? - My boyfriend's. A new one? Already? Yeah. Life goes on. The breakup's still fresh. Relationships might end, but life goes on. Sometimes, it's the opposite. Relationships go on, but life ends. Dad… I just wanted you… … to know… I want to apologize for what happened. What are you talking about? I don't want you to sacrifice yourself for me. You want me to stop the car so you can jump? I'm serious… Don't make any big decisions to protect me. I'm big enough to handle life. Does that boyfriend of yours have a serious job? - He teaches. - You're dating a teacher? How old is he? No, he's a freshman at college. He volunteers in his time off. He teaches construction workers to read. - Another one bringing joy to the people. - Exactly. It's a wonderful project. He's also wonderful. He teaches adults how to read and write. It's impressive. I don't know how he can juggle so much work with med school. Medicine? Settle down. I don't know if the relationship has a future. - Why? - His parents won't accept me. They won't? Why? - Who do they think they are? - They're Muslims. - That's what they think. - You really like to complicate things. You know, Dad, people fall in love. I'm not going to resign myself to not experiencing a great love. I think no one should. I used to think they should, but not anymore. We need to talk, Martin. It's because of the peeling. No, it's about us. - You too? - What? My wife said the same thing. I don't know what she wants to talk about. I know what you're thinking, but that's not it. I was perfect, she never suspected a thing. Or does she? Have you given any thought to the fact that she might be unhappy? No, she's unhappy, because she can't have children. - That's it. - Maybe she's in love with someone else. She's happy with me. She loves me. We began dating in school. She'd always say that I was the man of her dreams. Please, Martin. Have you never thought that her dreams might have changed? I can't imagine living without her. But you're right. - I think she wants to leave me. - Why do you say that? Because she said so. You sure you want to do this? - Don't come complaining to me next. - Well, look at you. I have the right to complain to you at least for two years. You complained to me a lot longer, girlfriend. - You're really into scolding. - That's what true friends do. Well, maybe I need fake friends. We're here. - Good luck. - Thank you. You're welcome. Joana, can I come watch? I won't say a word, I swear. Jeez… - Hi. - Hi, can I talk to you for a second? You don't need to worry about Martin. I'll take care of that. - You know my husband? - Well… We're good friends, but that's not important now. Since you broke up with Pedro, he's become a zombie. He can't even go to work. I tried to help, but… I couldn't. I think he needs your help. I don't know who stopped seeing who. But if he did something to hurt you, I'm sure he did it only to protect his family, his daughter. Sorry, I'd never go back to Pedro. Why? Don't you love him anymore? Because he's the great love of my life. ONE YEAR LATER Morning. - Morning. - Morning, Dr. Pedro. Morning. Christ, Ms. Rosa. You have to say no to these women. They insisted. You can't believe her when she says she can fit you in. I don't like to keep you waiting. - It's worth the wait. - And there's one inside already. You're beautiful, darling. Hi, Carla, baby. Am I interrupting? You bitch! One loses track of time in Paris. I'll hang up on you. - You should have come with me. - What for? So I could play the third wheel? I'd rather be more productive by working. Nonsense. There are a lot of interesting men here. - Who's this interesting man? - See? Mr. Jealous over here. António says "hi". - Everything all right? - I met a guy. - Nice, how is he? - Gorgeous. Tell me about it. We went out every day last week and to bed every night. - You know that skin thing? - She does. - I do. - She's an expert. Yes, I do, girlfriend. Yeah, we went down. - And then? - Then, he stopped calling me. He ghosted my texts and they were quite a lot. Basically, everything's the same. - My God. - Carla… Sorry to butt in, but… - You might suck in bed. - What're you talking about? - Maybe? - I don't see another explanation. Well, maybe it's because you're a bit annoying. Yeah, but it's better to be annoying than bad in the sack. It's not just that. Even I have had to put up with annoying people just for good sex. No, you see. She's annoying, because she's emotionally deprived. She's clingy. Hey, I can hear you speak. That's worse than being bad in the sack. But we have your diagnosis. Now, just change. Thank you so much. I'm feeling much better after that. - I have some news. - Tell us. - You heard about Martin? - No, what happened? Hold up. Sorry. - You still talk to him? - Stop with the jealous act. I haven't spoken to him in ages. - What happened? - Will you look at that? My boss is calling me. - We'll talk later. - But what happened? I'll tell you later. Are you coming to the wedding? Of course, I am. - What happened? - We'll talk later. - And Martin? - Bring me some nice wine. Mom, help me out, please. I missed you so much! You're growing prettier and prettier every day. - Mom. - My dear. Where are they? Oh, my God, would you look at grandma's babies. They loved the crib mobile grandma brought. I can't handle you calling yourself grandma. - I'm old enough to be their grandma. - No, you're not. You look just like your father. Really? I think they take after me. - And who do you take after, dear? - Makes sense. You always wanted siblings, Paula. I always wanted that. It's horrible to be a single child. Where's my little baby? Now I get it. - Why I didn't want more kids? - No, why you call yourself grandma. To tease Dad. - Why would you say that? - Come on, it's to make him feel old. Maybe. They say that sometimes we speak hidden truths. - Did I offend him? - Of course not. - Has dad ever been offended? - I think so too. How do you feel about the wedding? I feel great! What about you? How do you feel about it, you jealous little girl? Look at your dad cheating me over at a time like this. - Isn't it a bit late for jealousy? - I don't feel good. He knows I hate standing. I hate being a bridesmaid. We're gathered here today to celebrate Pilar and Pedro's wedding. Dr. Pedro. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Dr. Almir. A drink for my son-in-law. - I don't drink. - I forgot. - Socializing, babe? - You got to. Order a bloody Mary for me, please. There's that in my wedding? Of course, Dad. Pilar made it happen especially for me. Stop drinking, like your boyfriend. Who would have thought? My Dad head over heels for my boyfriend. The boy is quite reasonable and he doesn't drink. After Clóvis, whatever comes next is a keeper. - You don't mind him being Muslim? - Of course not. He'll straighten you up. And you'll look amazing in a burka. - Hi. - How's it going? - Fine. You? - Same. That accent… Where are you from? Hurry up my drink, friend. - Hey, guys. - Hi. - You know each other? - We're getting to. How nice. This is Almir, Paula's boyfriend. This is the bride's, Pilar's, ex-husband. - I see. - Pleasure. Well, see ya. I have to take this to Paula. We'll speak later. Sorry, but did you see that? His suit was spotless. His hair was perfectly in place. I thought he was… No, I was wrong. Yes, but all men nowadays are metrosexual. - That makes us so confused. - I was the one confused, Martin. - You were so sexual. - I'm more than that. Jesus. Why did you take so long to find out? I don't know. I started dating Pilar so early. - I had no time to think. - What about the affairs? Women always fell on my lap. What could I do? But not me. No, not you. You put up quite a fight. With a glass of Malbec wine. - Argentinian. - You joker. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Surprise! Hi, my love. Extending your circle of affection? You're such a little devil. Here comes the bride. With all this running around, I couldn't thank you for the presents. You have two such beautiful babies, Pilar. - Thank you. - No, I thank you. Paula always asked for siblings. Now it's fixed. Speaking of which, I need to ask you something. Sure, darling. - You won't be mad? - You stole my husband and we're okay. Joking. Stop saying you're their grandma. - Is it too much? - A little. Sorry, I'll stop. Darling. - Darling. - You're so beautiful. - You know I love you, right? - I do. - You know I feel the same for you, right? - I know. - What's going on? I'm calling Pilar. - Caught red-handed. - We went to Bahia. - Fancy. It is. Subtitle translation by: Nuno Oliveira
