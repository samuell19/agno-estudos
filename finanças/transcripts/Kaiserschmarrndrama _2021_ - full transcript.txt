(Rudi) Au! Oh, that hurts so much! My God, can't you numb that beforehand? This is so humiliating. Any dirty street dog is treated better than I am. Why don't you put me to sleep right away, you old hag! You fartbag! * she screams * You stinking white poison! How stupid can you be? * Leisurely music * Sorry, I'm looking for the Mr. Birkenberger. Am I in the right place? *Sob* Who do you think you are, Mr. Birkenberg? I am a patient! But a patient is also a human being! You stupid tramp! * she screeches * You catholic pissrag, you! * leisurely music continues to play * I've been vegetating here for eight weeks. And you don't stop by a single time. Not a single time. You look good. So for ... Double pelvic fracture, Break of collarbone, Rib fracture, Contusion of the spleen. Really, that much? - Yes, Franz, so much. And every day a physiotherapist with a degree in sadomasochism torments me. So is it better? No, nothing, zero, nada. For a hospital it isn't that bad at all. No, the Kaiserschmarrn is shit! There are way too many raisins in there. This is a drama, a Kaiserschmarrndrama this is. Do you already know when you're going to come out? - Yes and then what? I live on the third floor. How am I supposed to use the wheelchair to get up there without a lift? It'll be fine, huh? Don't you have a guilty conscience? - Why should I? Because of this. - Me? Yes, you. - Why? Who was driving the car? - You at the crucial moment. * quiet music from car radio * Eberhofer, keep in lane. - Who's Driving? Me. Because you already had a drink in the morning. When you have a sore throat you have to disinfect quickly and decisively. Not that far to the right. Stop now I have to concentrate. Watch out, car! - I see. You're doing that on purpose. Look out! Rudi! *Horn* * both scream * And you didn't even apologize. I'm not apologizing for your stupidity. You are such a self-righteous ignoramus. - You know what? Kiss my ass. * Workers speak lively Polish * What do you think is better? Super White or Crystal White? Crystal White is maybe a little too gray, right? Maybe better is "Sensation White". If we use the same tiles, we get a volume discount. - Yes. That's 10 percent off. You have to take that. Otherwise we would never have been able to afford the communal sauna. What communal sauna? This is the first time I've heard of that. We did the math. You will never get your own sauna so cheaply again. We're making a clean break, and everyone pays only half. Don't think for a second that Leopold and I will be naked in the same sauna. Please think of the children. Why do they need a community sauna? Why don't you discuss things like that with me? I've been trying to talk to you, God knows, for nine months, but you're not interested in anything that has to do with building a house. Yeah, I don't really care. Yes, but we want our house to be finished and beautiful. And a home. Leopold has given notice on his apartment. I'm out of mine Panida is having her second child, and I can't stand the mess forever. Is it that bad? Franz, do you really want our Pauli has to grow up in a stable? It didn't hurt Jesus. * Horns * * tense brass music * (Leopold) Father! Are you visiting us And the Lady? Better tell me what that is supposed to be. (Leopold) Looks good, right? Grandma builds the house for her grandchildren. And why don't I know anything about it, huh? Why doesn’t anyone tell me that she’s putting such a bourgeois shit hut on my meadow? Do you like it? - "Don't you like it"? What's to like? Susi, do you like this double concrete shit house? * Babble of voices * What do you want? Get lost, you! Go away now! Nobody wants to live there in such a shitty concrete castle. I was so happy to have you here. Then look forward a little longer, idiot! Franz, do we have a problem? No, it's just my father. And your father's a little balla? - Who's balla? I'll give you one in a moment Balla-Balla, my dear! *Polish* Mrs. Eberhofer, what delicious things have you cooked? Creamy goulash and noodles. Mama! (Father) That can't be true! - And what about Pauli? It turns all your toenails in such a shit house! What are you all thinking of? Do you still have them all? - Come on here. Crucifix !! Are you building a bourgeois shit hut too? - Nada. Let's go eat something. - To put such a shit house there! Now you eat something, and then the world will look different again. I don't want a good mood because I don't have one. *Polish* Stop the nonsense. Eat it! Eat it! - Dad! The house has to be finished before winter. If you keep on cooking, Grandma, the house will never be finished. * tries to speak Polish * Uh, sorry. No understand. It is true. The shell should have been finished long ago. You're gone for a year and the building craze breaks out. (Susi) If you'd stayed in Spain. Oh my. I do not know, what's wrong with Ludwig. Ludwig, what's going on? * Whine * If he's hungry, he'll eat. Franz, have you already told papa that the house was your idea? - Huh? Tell me, did they shit in your brain or what? Susi had a job offer in Fürstenfeldbruck. Franz panicked that Susi would move there with Paul. Then it slipped out of him. Better late than never. That was very brave of you, Franz. Franz, I have a present for you. Because we will soon be neighbors. Is St. Blaise. It helps against coughs. Yes, smoking, coughing. Funny, right? Hm. * Hard rock ringtone and conversation in Polish * This is the Officer Eberhofer, what can I do for you? You first choose the tiles. Chief, it's not a good moment. What? A dead body? In Niederkaltenkirchen? No way. Ha, ha, ha. Very funny, Rudi. You have to get up earlier if you want to fool me. Why are you getting involved now? I've got someone who gives me stupid answers. Have you ever heard of duty? And the husband has his office at home? Tell your sheriff to get his ass to the crime scene. Lord Almighty, move it already! Susi-Maus, I can have my cell phone back? Now go on. The house has to be ready by winter. *Polish* Now we're going shopping. * she groans * * leisurely music * Mr. Kessler found the body while walking his dog. And, what can you say? Dead, I would say. Could you stop dropping your butts at the crime scene? If you ask me... It's not rape. But I don't ask you. - The panties. What? - It's still on. Usually they get raped first and then killed. You don't need any intuition because Common sense is enough. - hm. Do you know who the woman could be? - a jogger. You see: jogging suit, running shoes. Killed from behind. Probably with a stone. But not rape, I bet. Are you now the specialist in violent crimes against female joggers? You know, feminicide is my quiet passion. Oh! What's his name? - No idea. Don't know what your dog is called? - Borrowed from the shelter. The doctor prescribed walks because of my heart. Four bypasses. How about less smoking? So as an investigator are you actually smart, or are you just pretending, huh? Max? Take Mr. Kessler into custody. I would like to talk to him. You, that is some trickery. What do you mean by custody? We don't have a cell. Yes, some initiative, Max. Ha? Okay good. I have an alibi. - Alibi never hurts, does it, Franz? Alright, let's go. - Hands off! Here we go. - Get your hands off, you little sausage. You are insulting an official. Official! I'll punch you in a minute. I use coercive measures. Max, you forgot the dog. * Moaning and coughing * (Kessler) Ouch, shit. I know them from somewhere. (Simmerl) Simone, she was so quiet. You hardly even noticed her. Are you sure it is her? I am not allowed to say anything about that. And now please open the door. Simone is dead? - Simmerl. (Simmerl) Yes. Frau Kitzeder, we are coming in now. I'm going in there. Without you. Merci. Hey, hey, Franz. We are special, aren't we? This is the home of a suspected murder victim. And you surely don't want your DNA all over there either. * tense music * Aha. * Buzz * * Beep * * Buzzing stops * Good day. Who are you now Would you like to see my dick once? No. * Beep * Hi? Hm. Rudi, I brought you something today. Great, a laptop. Should I look for a barrier-free apartment online? Rudi, we have a case! A dead jogger, slain. The dead woman lived at Simmerl's above the butcher shop. And she made videos of herself. Erotic. And you think I should do that too? "Rudi, a wheelchair beater." No, I mean that someone takes the woman's laptop so we can know what she was doing. Rudi, a really clever computer expert, huh? Ah, that's why you're here, Franz Eberhofer. Because you need a henchman to do the dirty work for you. Distraction is good for you. Franz? Your compassion disgusts me. Bye for now. It's been a pleasure. I'm a crippled wreck, but I still have feelings! Alright then. Mr. Birkenberger is as good as he ever was. The injuries have healed. All tests have shown that he should be able to walk normally again. In my opinion, the problem is more up here. You're the only one who has visited him in the past eight weeks. Can you talk to him about the possibility of psychotherapy? Rudi and psychotherapy? - Yes. Have fun. Please help me. The nurses have a knife to my chest. Either he'll be released or he'll make everyone sick. Yeah, then just release him. * Rock music * * Martinshorn * * muted rock music * What's going on? Are you there because of grandma? - No. And Pauli? Is there something with Pauli? Let's do it. * Cock crow * They kicked me out. Dismissed as cured. And what are you doing here with us? Think for a minute, boy. How should Rudi get into his apartment? Three floors! And no elevator. That is not possible. But what does that have to do with us? We're not a sanctuary. I'm not some discarded lab chimp. Do you have no compassion at all? Rudi stays with us here at the farm. Enough. Maybe I will be asked again? - Nope. (Franz) That is a great room. I've had 23 fantastic years here. But he can't get down from there on his own. And not up either. And where else should he go? Franz, you can't lock Rudi up here like a freak that is hidden from people. Nobody said anything about locking up. He can leave the door open. Now and then. Do you have a better idea? (Grandma) Mmm. You sleep there and Rudi goes into your pigsty. Hang on. I sleep in the pigsty. You can live with YOUR Rudi in YOUR pigsty like bachelors. Susi, this wasn't my idea. Instead of having a wife and child like a real family. You said yourself that he should stay. * Door slams * (Franz loudly) And it's only temporary. And don't you get the idea of yearning for your old nursery at night. (Polish) ... disaster. * thoughtful music * Ludwig, I don't know what problem Susi has with me. I could have a huge problem with her. Who blackmailed me into the new building with the job offer in Fürstenfeldbruck, huh? It was her! * quiet whimpering * Together with grandma. You know, if it were up to me, she would have kept her apartment and us our pigsty. Then there would always be peace between us. But Susi doesn't care what I want, because Susi always knows best what is best for everyone anyway. And I'm always the culprit in the end. Sucks. Come on let's go home Ludwig. Come on, there's something to eat at home. * quiet whimpering * Oh, Ludwig, you lazy sack. Ludwig, come on. * Groans and whimpers * * Blues music * Come on, Flötzinger. Mary is sure to come back. Well, it doesn't look like it this time. I am single now. (Franz) Well. Mary and her brats made a private Brexit and she's she returned to her people in England with the whole nine yards. Serves him right too. Flötzinger, there's something good about being single, right? Half the world's population are women, and that's quite... a lot. You are also the number one womanizer in Niederkaltenkirchen. The pimperman! - yeah! No longer. Since Mary left, I've lost my erotic magnetism. Until the end of my days, I'll only take my Ignaz out to piss. Somewhere out there is sure to be a woman just waiting for you. Hello. Can I get something to drink from you? My husband is at the biker meet and I ran out of beer. * Blues music gets louder * Hello. Uh, you, that was meant more figuratively. * fast polka rock * Shit, Beischler is tearing Flötzinger completely to shreds. Ah come on * Music: "Vegas Wedding Bells" by Pete Surdoval * A whole new life. My, that would be nice. Completely somewhere else, where nobody knows you. In Czech Republic. You, Ignaz ... let's get away Right now. Franz, do something! Do you have a car? I even have a delivery truck. I think I can still drive. And otherwise? Franz, nothing can stop us. We're starting from scratch. I think that's really great! We’re going to have a drink to that now, right? Wolfi! Bottle, glass! Well, well, well. We actually wanted to, uh ... To freedom! - And to love! I agree! To love! # Two of a kind is not a very good hand. # And sometimes winners lose # in marriages unplanned. # Oh, Vegas Wedding bells, # Vegas wedding bells. # I should've run like hell # when I heard those wedding bells. # Vegas wedding bells. # Vegas wedding bells. # I should've run like hell # when I heard those Vegas wedding bells. * Song ends * *Snoring* Hush! Ha? * loud shuffling * * loud groan * Susimaus, are you sleeping yet? * both scream * What are you doing here? Bah, you stink like a booze corpse in the terminal stage. - Stop, it's OK. Yeah. * Hard rock ringtone and moan * Eberhofer. Mr. Eberhofer, you have to come right away. Did something happen? * Motorcycle rattle * Well not yet. My husband is at the door with his whole motorcycle club. Yes and? And Herr Flötzinger is hiding in my basement. Oh. Rudi, can you drive me? (sweetly) Sure, I'll drive you with that 400 hp wheelchair wherever you want. Kitzbühel, St. Tropez ... Sorry. * sluggish music * * muffled babble of voices * Yes? Is Flötzinger still here? Uh, good evening. Why should Flötzinger be here in the middle of the night? Yes, my, uh ... Flötzinger? It's me. Oh shit, Franz, they're all still here. Mmm. So, you two boobs, what is this supposed to be now? Ah... Yes, there is a very simple explanation. Right, Franz? Me? Uh, uh, uh ... Yes, the sensor on your gas tank, um, it has, um ... it reported via radio that it had a leak. And none of you were here. Makes sense. We weren't here. We were at a biker meet in Ansbach until the beer ran out. I ... I wasn't here either. I ran out of beer too. I agree. And that's why I called Flötzinger out so that your house wouldn't blow up. - Yeah, that was tricky. Really? Yeah, uh ... I'm so sorry for forgetting you, but it was so busy. - It doesn't matter. Bless you. May we have a short time? * high-speed engine * *Quiet music* Are you crazy, Franz? Do you wanna kill us Well, you wanted to kill us! * polyphonic snoring * Come on, go to sleep. I am tired. Strange. I always thought that we had oil heating. * Cock crow * Do you like it really dirty? *Giggle* Then have a look at Mona. I am plump and in heat and really horny to fulfill your wishes. Rudi, can that be quieter? Our dead woman was a leisure slut. See. Horny amateurs are waiting for you. *Giggle* * Whine * (Rudi groaning) So ... Let's go, Franz. We have to go. Well, we want to sleep in. The medical examiner has results. * Spray can hiss * Ouch! You're in line like the last idiot. I'm so sorry. I will soon be getting my nursing papers. Franz, we have to. - Yes. And, dad, is that all? Oh, the shit spray can is empty again! Do you want to talk stupid? You should be grateful to me for that. In the past, you'd rather have been buried than move into something like that. You used to protest more passionately. No fear. I'll go straight to the hardware store and get some cans, and then I'll shit slogans all over this crap house for you. And that was it? - Then at least you have it in writing. Uh, written protest. Ui, ul, ul! Another would climb a cooling tower or chain himself naked to a fence. But you're too old for that, aren't you? You know what? Up here I'm as young as you've never been, you stag! Oh well... You will see. Just move yourself along. We should've been on our way long ago. - I'm coming. * lively music * (Rudi) You're driving too far to the left. One mistake and we end up in the sticks. (Franz) hands off! Do you want to walk? (Rudi) I would love to do that. (both) Hello. Hello Eberhofer and Birkenberger. Hey Rudi, did you also come along today, huh? Haven't seen you for a long time. You look good. Slimmer somehow ... in the face. Yes gentlemen What can I offer you? So, targeted blow to the back of the head, probably with a stone. And then, lights out. Finito. Time of death probably Thursday late afternoon. No signs of a struggle or rape. He was probably interrupted. Or he lost interest. I can't make sense of the living. Honestly. Is that going to happen to him, right? Mei. He's probably just vegetating, right? It would have been better if he had been... He has a name. And he's really fun-loving again. Yes Perfect! Günther, have you ever wondered why they put you with the dead? Why? - Uh huh. Is there actually a test to determine if one is faking or can walk again? Asshole! Could it be that he became even more irritable after the accident? Whoa, don't ask. Wow ... - My God, yes. Ah yes, look. They found this on the dead woman. (loud) That's a smartphone, Rudi. I'm not blind. Yes, let's see then. * Tuten * * sedate music * Dear Lord Jesus, to you we entrust our worries. (sniffing) Please protect my sister Simone. Hold her in your hands as you hold and keep us. Do you have any idea who might have killed Simone? Did she have a boyfriend? I think Simone has ... My sister wanted to catch up on her high school and studied all day. * hiccup chuckle * There was no time for a relationship. Did you know, um ... that Simone Yes... was active on the internet? VERY active. Pig stuff. Filthy videos. Live cam. Well, it's true. Do you like it really dirty too? Then take a look at Mona. I am plump and in heat ... Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! (Rudi) Au! Ouch! Christian! Christian! - ouch! No ow! This is not my sister! Did you know about the videos? That is ... I don't think so. Mr. Kitzeder, this is now less a question of belief. My sister is barely dead and here you come along with disgusting slander! Christian. The gentlemen are just doing their job. Pastor, your little sister earns her money in a sinful way. That can make you grumpy. You could also get carried away in the heat of the moment. - Hmhm! My sister was my everything. And this ... video, someone must have forced her to do it. Yes, or ... or blackmailed. Yes and who? Yeah, that's... I don't know. That's for you to find out. That's your job. You, um, Rudi? Could it be that questioning witnesses is still quite exhausting for you? How so? It worked great. - Oh well. Your problem is that you don't know anything about interrogation techniques, Franz Eberhofer. I come because Flötzinger wanted to hang the radiators, and he doesn't show up. The slacker doesn't answer the phone either. Strange. Where is father? * Babble * This is for Rudi. Save something for the Panida. She eats for two at the moment. Are you crazy? - It was a joke. Franz, you have to help me with the electrical plan. Stop here. Please. So, should the light in the bedroom also come on from the bathroom? Or do we do it so that the light in the bathroom can be switched on from the bedroom? Speaking of bedrooms. Franz, will you please listen to me properly? Make sure that Flötzinger hangs up the fucking radiators. I'm running out of time. * Hard rock ringtone * Rudi, I'm on my way. If you'd rather move into the house with Rudi, just let us know. No problem. Franzl, Susi is giving you a lot of orders. You have to be careful. Especially if you move in with her. Yes grandma - Otherwise, you won't have any say. He doesn't already have that. Thank God. Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to start building. * Throat clearing * Could someone else have taken you to the toilet? Franz, going to the toilet is an intimate affair. If you ask me, more intimate than sex. You don't do that with everyone. Now I have butterflies in my stomach too. Franz? This is a private area! Franek, we have a problem. What is the rubbish supposed to be? Father are you crazy? I protest against the gentrification of my farm, understand? You're coming down there right now! March! - I'll do a shit. Franz, now do something! He is your father after all. Please come down. What you are doing is totally unreasonable. He only needs to get bored without his weed. He'll come down on his own. As stubborn as he is, that'll take forever. We need the crane, otherwise the roof structure won't be finished. (posed) Oh my god! Father, please come down. How else are we supposed to finish our house? I can hardly move the crane. (hysterically) The roof has to be put on, otherwise the house won't ever be finished. Franz Eberhofer. Did you have anything to do with the crane crew? Darling Susi. Has my father ever done what I wanted him to do? Philistine hell! Philistine hell! If you don't come down right now then I'll torch your hash. Oh, my smart-assed boy is back. Look what I've got. I've already got the good stuff up here. You can burn it down, piglet. (Susi) Franz, do something! I'm going to see Rudi, he's on the toilet and he's finished now. (Leopold) Shit stuff! - I can't believe it. (Rudi) You don't earn that much money with webcam erotica. At least not Simone. I did a little research. She earned 1,000 to 1,500 a month. So quasi a minimum wage. Although she had a few regular customers. You even know one of them. The list is on the table. No! I'm ready now. Franz? *Door* Franz? I thought we are a team! * Church bell strikes " I know it was a huge mistake, but I'm not going to kill a woman. What was a huge mistake? Well, there were a few beers too many. Gisela was with the countrywomen, and there's not much going on at the moment. That's when you remembered the erotically open-minded tenant. Flötzinger got me on it. - Do not distract! Yes. Franz, I swear it was only once. And only very briefly. And she didn't like it at all. I think. Did you have an affair with the murder victim? Franz, there you are. I've been looking for you all over the Town Hall. This is my office. Where else should I be? What do I do now with Kessler who found Simone's body? He has a A-1 alibi, because he was in the, uh, nail salon ... Dad? What are you doing here? Interviewing witnesses. Oh, can I take part? (both) No! And now, go away. - Well, I'll come back later then. Simmerl, this murder has put a hole in your fun. Franz, you have to leave Gisela out of the picture. Yeah, fear not. I can be super discreet. * driving music * Oh! Gisela, it was just ... Gisela, it was just ... physical. Only physical, you know? Oh, you're always smarter afterwards, aren't you? I think Gisela really had no idea about your affair. I have to go home. I think the Rudi is still sitting on the toilet. Bye now. No, ni ...! Gisela, uh ... How can you forget someone while you're talking to them? Or did you want to test me? If I can walk? Whether Rudi Birkenberger is just faking it? So that everyone feels sorry for him. * quiet whimpering * Ludwig, what's the matter with you? * Whine * Tell me, Ludwig, you're not feeling well, are you? Can you not cuddle with the dog? I also have needs. * Swallow calls * Franz? What are you doing with Ludwig there? What's going on? Yes... How old is Ludwig again? Ah yes, he's already 14. It's not old age yet, is it? Hm. Yes and? Mr. Eberhofer, concerning the overall condition of your dog, there is so to speak nothing more in the green area. Yes, but you will be able to do something. So, if you want to you want to do something good for him, you leave him here, and I'll give him a shot. Do you want to put him to sleep? * Whine * I understand you. But you don't want to torture him. - You don't understand anything. Ludwig will not be put down. You will prescribe me some remedy, and I'll agree with you, that we will still have a nice year or two. Do you understand me now? I'm afraid you're not listening to me. Ludwig's time has run out. No, you didn't listen to me. Ludwig does not die. Besides, I don't want to discuss this in front of the dog. Period. * melancholy music * What does the vet say? - The stupid cow has no idea. Tomorrow I'm going to a smart vet. Father. Why don't you sit on your crane? - Yes meli. I have to look after Ludwig. Yes what things are you doing? Hm? He dies? - No he does not! He can't die, he is part of the family. * Whine * Franz, I'll take over the first watch. I'll do it by myself. No. We both have to be fit tomorrow. We have a murder to solve. Rudi, I won't leave Ludwig alone. You two lie down and sleep a little. I'll take over the night watch. And now no more discussion. Oh my. You won't feel any better from all that chemical shit. Hm you * Whine * (Susi) Is he in pain? I do not think so. The vet pumped him pretty full. Doesn't look good to him, does it? - hm. Then we will all take care of him now and show him a good time. Yes. My, Franz. * Paul babbles * * lively reggae music * What kind of mess are you making there, eh? Leave me alone, you don't understand anything about it. And I can clean it up again tomorrow, huh? Yes, of course. Go on, sneak out. Go to bed. Why don't you get back on the crane? You were tidy there. - Yeah, nice. (Susi) Help me out. (Franz) Your knuckles there. *Groan* (Susi) I feel like a teenager. Yes, I feel more like a retired couple. * Hard rock ringtone * * both sigh * Flötzinger. Not the time. * Babble of voices in the background * Franz? (Beischl) Flötzinger, where is the beer? There, take it. I'm so happy that you are all here. Very cool of you. Your facility is modern now, isn't it? Flötzinger, do you know why we are actually visiting you? Are you having problems with the gas again? Men. Who is in favor of the Flötzinger becoming an honorary member of the club? * Owl call * But that's not necessary. I always like to help, where I can. Richie? Do you have your machine with you? Of course. * Buzz * To be able to wear the club's logo on your skin forever is a huge honour. But I don't have a motorcycle. * rhythmic squeak * * Groans and moans * * sharp scream and painful moan * What's happening? - Your father. What? Dad, come on, get away! - You don't have a bed? You wanted to take care of Ludwig. - What am I doing right now? Okay, where were we? Franz, don't be angry with me but your father has killed the mood. Hm. This will do you good, you'll see. Hm? Right? I knew it was tasty. I like it too. It'll do us both good. * dynamic music * Birkenberger? I hope you can read. It says: "For Ludwig", right? *Groan* So... * Cock crow * Yes, Ludwig! What are you doing there? Are you feeling better? Know what We'll get Rudi now, and then we'll have something nice for breakfast, huh? * Ludwig grumbles * Ludwig? Ludwig, come on. Hm. *Bark* *Squeak* (loud) Rudi! Good news: Ludwig is doing better. The vet has no idea. Now there is a "1st class Ms. Eberhofer breakfast". Then the world will look completely different. Your world is enviably simple, Franz Eberhofer. Come. (Grandma) My, Ludwig likes it today. Nice! Looks really sharp. Not everyone has one, right? But tell me, don't you write "Rebels" a little differently? 1st Class. The Kaiserschmarrn? 1st Class. He's slowly over the mountain. (quietly) Thank you, Grandma. Ah, Omal! I think Ludwig needs another helping. Again? Ah, that's not normal. He has a healthy appetite. Right, Ludwig? And the stupid cow wanted to put you down. Hey, Franz. Your dad's overdoing it with the drug diet, huh? - Mhm. Rudi, for once: hats off. Without your nose, I would never have gotten onto Simmerl. He was having an affair with the murder victim. - Really now? What a bastard! He didn't tell me that at all. Our tattooed man here was also a customer of Mona. Chubby and in heat, right? Wait a minute. I'm not a suspect, am I? You don't have an alibi. - Why would I have killed her? Maybe she wasn't as willing as you were? - Franz? Are you still completely clean, huh? Since when do I have to force a woman to have sex? * Papa laughs happily * And you're a member of a biker gang in a state of mental distress. Physically, too. Quite a few others have been taken into custody because of this. Ah, kiss my ass! I looked at the connection data from the Simone on her live channel. On the 27th she was murdered. Of course, she still has customers logging in. Except for two. Two what? - Two regular customers. Before she was murdered, they logged in regularly and then suddenly stopped. Why? Because they already knew that she was dead. Yeah, but suspect me, huh? You stupid bastards. * lively music * * Moped goes out * Yes, look here, Mr. Flötzinger. Do you know why I'm stopping you? No, he doesn't know. Your two-wheeler has exceeded the permissible speed of 100 km / h. Max, do you know I don't give a shit? I think so, you have tuned up your moped. Do you have a permit from the DMV for this? Oops, I think the speed camera is broken. That is probably resistance to state authority. And I probably don't care. Read once, you bugger. "Born Rebles." That's Born Rebels. - Don't you write it differently? As a born rebel, I'll write however I want. You go to your mama now, and I'll tear myself up a tattooed biker chick at the roadhouse. Isn't it dangerous to be topless? I like to live dangerously. * Music fades out * Yes? Why didn't you put the man through the wringer? Because it wasn't him. Ah! And how do you know that, Mister Super Smart? The man is disabled. How is he supposed to kill Simone, please? What do you mean? I could kill someone right now. Me too. But that is not forbidden now. I ... I mean, the Mona she ... she was 18, wasn't she? That's not illegal. - That does not get my attention. Killing does. Killing? Mona's original name was Simone Kitzeder and she was hit with a rock Thursday in the woods while jogging. And now you suspect me? Seriously? Why didn't you continue to visit Mona? Did you know that she was dead? Because I didn't feel like it anymore. - Or do you want more? Was the virtual Mona no longer enough? But she struggled when you pulled her pants down. I don't know what you want from me. And why not the underpants? Did she scream? It's easy to panic. Rudi! Suppose you didn't kill Simone. Then, of course, you have an alibi, right? Yes hello, policeman. Are you real or did someone buy me a stripper? No, we are real and we're here because of your husband. What have you done now, honey? - Nothing. The man drives me insane. Did he speed past the kindergarten at 100 again? But... - Can I finish, honey? Thank you! But... - I'm so fed up now! I'm selling the Porsche. Just look at him. He can hardly get in there with his paunch. Let alone out again. My honeymoon has been in the mid-life crisis for 12 years. I'll make three crosses when this is finally over. Hm. Yes it is: Your husband is a witness in some, uh... neighborhood thing... story. So? Where was your husband at? Thursday from 5 p.m.? First with me here in the shop and then at home. My little man prefers to spend his time with his wife, right? Yes, that's right. (loudly) You have to pull, not push! Pull! Franz? * Rudi loudly in the background * Oops, it's all worn out. Don't you even want to try a pair of skinny jeans? I actually really like it spacious. Skin-tight makes a nice ass. Have a look at me. Hm? (Rudi) No, pull! Franz! I come on I have to. My wife also jogs regularly in the forest. And now to think that there is a sex offender walking around ... Mr. Anzengruber, calm down. There is no sex offender running around and lying in wait for women. We believe she knew her killer. There is absolutely no need to worry. Goodbye. Goodbye. See you * sluggish music * Looks like the first murder, only a lot more brutal. She was killed in a rage. Oh shit. Ms. Anzengruber. If there really is a serial killer on the loose, then we have a murder problem. We don't even know if it was the same guy. You attract the murders like the poor soul attracts the devil. But I can't help it. Günther says it was like the first murder, only more brutal. - What? The killer was still hitting the victim when she was dead. - Who? Like I said: Someone is killing with rage. Goodbye Chief. Eberhofer? Trade association, hotel and restaurant association, small animal breeders association, they all give me hell. And now we have a serial killer here with us too. We don't even know that. - That’s what I’m talking about: you don’t know anything! There's a serial killer here, and you and your Leftutti are picking your nose. Well, well, well! Nothing against inclusion in the public service, but we need professionals now. Mayor, I won't be able to keep the press and television away much longer. Christ, that now too. And the worst part is, I'm already starting to hear voices. All the while in my office are calls out of the basement: "Help! Help!" Max, what did you do with the Kessler? Oh shit, the Kessler. I completely forgot about it. Mr. Eberhofer, nice to see you again. My joy is entirely on my side. - Less on mine. Birkenberger. Here too. That's a cute thing you've made. What's that supposed to be? Well that's ... - Shh! That was a rhetorical question. So, and now you just leave everything where it is and bye, servus and baba. Wait a minute, this is my case. So, your case? I thought you needed me ... Don't argue, Special Investiation will take care of the case now. And now you can get back to doing what you do best. Parking violators and pubic urination. What is the stupid cow imagining? It's good that I don't hit women. If you hadn't held me... Special Investigation! Don't make me laugh, ha, ha! Asswipes. Mr. Kessler, I have some good news for you. Your alibi checks out, and because you've been quite cooperative, I may now officially dismiss you. So how does that sound to you? I'll report you. For abuse and deprivation of liberty! I would have expected a little more gratitude. - Ass! Ludwig! Ludwig! *Polish* (Susi) Ludwig! (Bricklayer) Ludwig! What's going on? - Ludwig! What about Ludwig? Ludwig is gone. (Papa) Ludwig! (Susi) Ludwig! * Cricket chirps * *sad music and quiet sobs* I'll go now and... get a wheelbarrow. For what reason? So that we can bring him home. Let it be, Dad. Ludwig doesn't like home. Otherwise he would have died at home. Can you please bring a spade? Because, Ludwig, wants to stay here. * Sniffing * * Polish singing begins * *polish music over silent scene* * Music fades out, chicken cackling and swallow calls * This Thin Lizzie with Special Investigation. They're just messing around in a pseudo-professional manner. They don't have anyone who knows how things work in Niederkaltenkirchen. I can imagine that with my modest help you could quickly find something that Special Investigation couldn't in 100 years. Rudi, I don't give a shit about the serial killer right now. There's more to it than that. It's about the triumph of justice. Crime and Punishment. The point is that we solve this case and not this. You're welcome to solve the case on your own, but leave me alone. Did you leave me alone in my rehab? No did not. I wanted to be left alone so the world could kiss my ass. But no, the Eberhofer didn't leave me alone with his great case. 'Sorry. I now understand that that was a mistake. Too late. Now you can’t get rid of me. Kiss my ass. - Happily. But first let's solve the case. - You don't rest, do you? Definitely not. They dug up the soil and took it to the lab. Pros. But that doesn't mean that they'll find something. The second dead woman looked in that direction and came from there. And the first one? - Her too. They were both killed from behind, so the killer probably came from there, too. Franz? Okay, that sounds logical. I know that myself. I want you to push me in that direction. - Yes. * Franz sighs * There! Wildlife camera. It triggers with a motion detector. And in which direction is it looking? Right, in the direction of the crime scene. Franz? Do you have a bolt cutter in your car? (Franz) There is only forest floor and critters to be seen. Ah! The 27th, 6:38 p.m. That was the evening of the first murder. Can you see who is driving? - No but... the license plate. "Dingolfing-EV." Dear Special Investigation, I've already found the needle, you're still looking for the haystack. Yes, that's our station wagon. Was I driving too fast? Where were you last Thursday, early evening? Who are you, anyway? - The one who asks the questions. So Thursday the 27th? On Thursdays I have my bible study group at 7 pm. And before? Were we traveling by car? - No! Tuesday, Thursday and Friday my wife always has the car. There she is with the children in Landshut at swimming lessons. Right, Theresa? You went to swim school on Thursday, didn't you? Theresi? Yes, go on, say something! Our children are competitive swimmers, I always drive them ... And how do you explain that last Thursday around that time your car turned up on a forest path near Niederkaltenkirchen? Theresa? What have you done? Hm? What you have done? * spherical music and whispers * I did what I ... - Mrs. Kitzeder? Uh, Ms. Dings, you're coming at an awkward time right now. I am arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Simone Kitzeder and Susanne Anzengruber. - Ah go! Wait a moment, this is our arrest. How do you know that it was Frau Kitzeder? We at Special Investigation don't just pick our noses all day. Aha! Fiber traces at the crime scene, witness statements describing the alleged perpetrator as religiously fanatical... - I am an upright Protestant! Almighty God Merciful Father. I confess my sins before you. In deep regret I ask: Forgive me of my sins. But Therese! Your wife could not bear that your sister's activity might rub off on your reputation. I didn't want to kill Simone. I wanted to tell her that God forgives her, but she made me.... she laughed at me. What kind of monster are you? You killed Simone? Christian. Your sister was a whore. She took advantage of you, and she blackmailed you. So that it doesn't come out what she was doing. - You are crazy! Do you think people want a minister whose sister puts the kind of things in her mumu that others might feed their children? And that's why you killed two people? - No, not the other one. The court will sort it out. - Leave me alone! (screeching) Leave me! No! No! Thieves! Let me! No! Let me! No! Let me go! And why the Anzengruber? Disguise the 1st murder? Occurs more often than you think. And what if not, Miss Oberschlau? Be careful that I don't report you. For overstepping authority. Ms. Lizzy, could I get my office back, please? Oh... That stupid cow is taking our bust away from us, and you're still so fucking friendly to her. * loud whimpering * No offense, pastor. It will be allright. There are worse things. * Sobs and whimpers * Just ten minutes earlier and WE would have arrested the pastor's wife. But Mr. Eberhofer was still busy with his dead dog. Watch out, thin ice! It's a matter of professionalism, that you don't get distracted by private things. It's easy to say when you have no private life. Woah, first put me in a wheelchair, and then accuse me of being an loner because I'm disabled! Rudi, you have always been disabled in dealing with others. Wow! *Sigh* * music getting faster * So, Franz ... Franz? Oh. Franz! *Groan* * Music slows down again * Where do you want to go? Come. What am I to you? A malingerer who has taken up residence with you? Or a friend? Do we have to have this bullshit discussion now? What actually goes into your duplex? What do you mean? - On the first floor, for example. You're asking me something. Guest room. - There's no place there. Not at the top either? - No why? Well, for guests. - What kind of guests? Me maybe Do you want to stay over tonight? No, thanks. - Then why do you keep asking for a guest room? I have my answers. - What questions then? Franz, I will no longer be a burden to you. I'll be picked up and stored somewhere. Yes, great, fits. Franz Eberhofer. I'm hereby officially ending our friendship. *Quiet music* Rudi, you are an unbelievable diva-idiot. Hey you, grandma is making a Kaiserschmarrn tonight. See you later. * Door squeak * Lukwig? Lukwig! Lukwig! Look, Pauli, Ludwig was old and tired. And now he's in dog heaven with very, very many other dogs. Know? * Police siren * * Tire squeal * You forgot something. You're going to all this trouble over a pair of underpants? You know what it reminded me of? - Of me. Makes me happy, thank you. Rudi, I just lost my dog. I don't want to lose my best friend now, too. Because of the underpants: It doesn't make sense that the priest's wife beat Anzengruber to death. My speech. Yes, but how did a second killer know the sweatpants had been pulled down? It wasn't in any newspaper. - Yes, only the perpetrator would know that. I'm getting out here. If it wasn't the pastor's wife, who else knew about the sweatpants? You and me, Moratschek, Max and Kessler. Spusi and that Thin Lizzie from Special Investigation, and Günther our friend the medical examiner. And everyone to whom one of them told something, and everyone to whom again one of them told something. We're driving into a dead end and it was the pastor's wife, wasn't it? The Anzengruber. YOU told him something. Ha! The Anzengruber. A veritable professional failure, and she made him feel it. The boutiques belong to his wife. He was only employed. Maybe she wanted to leave him? And that's when he thought, I'm going to be a copycat killer. Franz... This Mr. Anzengruber, we'll take care of him now. Hands off! These are Ludwig's. Sorry, but I'm hungry now. You're eating my dead dog's meatballs? I'll do it in good memory. That would certainly not be right for Ludwig, if the good food went to waste. * moaning with pleasure * (Rudi) I believe that each of us can become a mi-, ma-, murderer. You may think now that murder is absurd, or you may think something else, or nothing at all. I can't know that. You can't look inside people's heads. But then a lot of things come together: Financial matters, feelings, mosquitoes, sexual desires. And suddenly something clicks in your head, or clacks, and someone is dead. Someone else. Or yourself. Or both of them. Or the whole family. Or the pants. Dead pants, you understand? Are you okay? - I feel excellent. Did i just say something? * Church bell strikes * * Rudi makes engine noises in the background* She was my everything, my wife. My best girl friend. My soulmate. I find your colleague's behavior completely inappropriate. Uh '! Uuuh ... And she was your boss, too, your wife? She just had her boutiques before we met. Which soon now, will be yours. Do you have any chips? - What? Why chips? Or flips? Or a potato salad? - Pull yourself together! I'll call my lawyer now. 5, 4, 8, 6. 3, 8, 2. Damn! Do you know what a game camera is? - I know it. A game camera is actually supposed to photograph foxes, rabbits and deer. But sometimes a car gets caught too. - Or a raccoon. Or a person. Near a fitness trail in Niederkaltenkirchen. * soundless laughter * Oh, now he hesitates. Maybe he's just bluffing, Eberhofer. - Rudi! Did you see the look? The view! Such a bad actor ... And? What will he do now, the wife murderer? How does he get out of the mousetrap? So. Mouse ... Oh, oh! This is funny. Whoever pulls a gun is actually always to blame. I agree. (laughing hysterically) Franz? Franz, what ...? Go away, you fool! * Rudi screams in panic * Franz! Franz? * moronic laughter and dramatic music * I am the terminator. I can walk again. - But not for long. Oh-ho-ho! * diabolical laugh * I am invincible. You have the right to remain silent. - That's impossible. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court. Stop! * Gunshot and outcry * * groaning screams and spherical music * Hasta la vista! * echoing rumble * Let someone else say that smoking is a health hazard. Yeah, I can see that. Why is this a serial killer again? Two murders, two perpetrators. How is it serial? There is no series. Mr. Anzengruber is a copycat killer. He drew inspiration from the first murder. And why did your colleague Eberhofer shoot the copycat killer in the knee? Wouldn't that have been more your job? Mr. Eberhofer? - Mmm? Why can't you follow orders? - Huh? Is your masculinity not compatible with female leadership? - M-m. Do you know Eberhofer's grandmother and wife? He has nothing to say at home. He tries to compensate for that. That's how I explain it to myself. - For all I care. I have to go to my partner now. They found drugs in my blood. Drugs! I have no idea where that could have come from. Franz? You have saved my life once again. And once again, it's a very, very happy occurance. * Rudi groans in pain * Is this the part where you just take off and don't get back to me for another year? - No! Why? (Rudi) No? Nice. Very very nice. Um, sorry, You can also sit right next to your significant other. I go outside. - Né! Get undressed! Get undressed! Get undressed... * awesome murmur * This lighter, which Leopold gave him by the way, saved my Franz's life. If it hadn't blocked the bullet in its breast pocket, God knows what could have happened, says the doctor. Kiss my ass! - That's some luck. Wolfi, I'm going to have another sour Radler. It's already after ten, Flötzinger. - What? Really? Shit, I have to go home. Was a joke. That's not funny. - But. Come on, show Franz your electronic handcuff. Wow! Did you bring that with you from England? My wife wants proof that I've reformed. That's why this shit tracker. Mary gets all his vitals live on her cell phone. She can see exactly when and where he is and how he is physically active. And Beischl? I tell her we can't see each other anymore. Period. Out. Shit. Uh, uhm ... Hello. You... Um, I think I need to talk to you. Yes, I've been looking for you. Hm. - Ignatz? Don't be angry with me, but we can't see each other anymore. You know you're pulling me down too much. What? I'm pulling you down ?! You are very dear, but ... what was between us was just more physical. - Mmm. And ... I was drunk too. Sorry. Bye. Wait a minute. * Beep * You can't just break up with me. Shit ...! * quick beeping * You, Franz? About the tracker, would that be something for you too? Hm? Franz, that was fun. What do you think of me? Franz, another beer? (Simmerl) Caution! Grandma, your great-grandson is coming in eight days. It's about time. Then we hope that your house will be finished soon and that peace will return. (Leopold slurping) Grandma, to our house. Panida is not allowed. *Thai* I can't watch over all of you forever either. Oh grandma, a little more is still possible. That can happen quickly. As with our Ludwig. *Ring* Now my speech comes. Vain like father and happiness. Everyone who has built a house today is a man of the earth. Believes firmly in art and God and the Virgin. Cheers! Cheers! - Cheers! - For the benefit * Clink * Cheers! - Cheers. * Clink * Have we toasted yet, Franz? Leopold, can you please stop drumming on my back? Brother, relax. Today is a celebration! You stop now, or I'll punch you. We know you think it's a shitty house. But at some point is enough is enough. - I agree. I never wanted the house. Why should I be happy there? Because it's about our future? And Pauli's? Everything was great the way it was. - No, it wasn't! But you've never understood that. Look what you've done. You don't deserve a woman like Susi. Spare me your commentary! And why? - Because you're drunk and talking shit. Oh, Mr. Moral Highground. Where is your problem? You're all to happy to give yourself one. We're celebrating a roof-raising, damn it! If that's not a reason to celebrate, what is? How many houses do you build in a lifetime? What's your problem? My problem is, I don't like new houses or new furniture. And now I'll soon be living in a new house with new furniture and you. With a shared basement and shared sauna. Is that enough for now? For the life of you, why do you not like me, Franz? Because you are who you are. You make me so mad. You know what I would love to do right now? Well, and I'm not interested either. I would love to sit in that excavator and knock down that new building right before your eyes. Please, knock yourself out. He's not really going to do that, is he? - Nah. He'll do it. - He doesn't have the balls to do that. * lively music * He's doing it. - Never! Shit! - Our house! (Susi) Franz, do something! - Putt. That's my boy. (Flötzinger) Bad, bad. Very bad. Leopold, leave the junk! - Are you crazy? Stop it! That just cost a lot of money! It's all broken now. Don't drive into your own home! Do something! Uff. Tell me, are you still smart? Have you gone mad? I said that the house was junk. If you don't shut your trap right now, I'll forget about myself. Susi. Susi, come on. *Sob* I feel so bad. That serves you right! - Susi! Franz, Leopold, stop it! Panida ... Franz, call an ambulance. I drive myself, it's faster. - Stop! Stop! I'll take care of that. That is the husband's job. You're not doing anything anymore! Breathe deeply. Breathe well, Panida. Great. *Whimper* You are doing great! Franz, drive faster. I'm pushing. - No, don't push. Panida! Franz, she's pushing! She's pushing! I get it already, we're pushing. I am not upset. I am serenity itself. I am serenity itself. I am serenity itself. * Beeping * Damn thing! (Susi) Now finally overtake him! You lame bastard, you! Stop pushing! Good God! Come on, breathe. * Horn and panicked screams * You have to stop pushing! Do you hear what i'm saying? It's coming. What? - She can't hold on anymore. I think that's the head. * Tire squeal, Screams and Splashes * * Baby crying * Great, Franz. Did it have to be now? * Baby crying * You did a great job, Panida. I am so embarrassed. Don't be ashamed, please wash your hands of it. And, do you already know what your son should be called? What, it's a boy? What do you think of Franz, Franz? - Franz? You brought him into the world. I will never forget that. Yes, but Susi was there too. - But Susi for a boy? Franz, today is an important day in my life, and that's why I would like to apologize for ... Yeah, it was stupid of me to crash into the house. With luck, it's not so bad. Yeah, it'll be OK. You know, today is practically a new beginning. For my family and for me. And maybe it can be one for you too. You always think that everything should stay the way it is, then nothing can go wrong. But how do you know that? If you never try anything new, you won't learn anything. These are all experiences. And bad experiences are always more valuable than none at all. Let that go through your head. And one more thing, Franz. I really love you. Honestly, with all your quirks, who you are and what's happened between us. I ... I like you. Honestly. Whether you want to hear that or not. Rather not. You stink like a weasel, Leopold. Yes... But cool, right? - Hm ... The construction company says it's not that bad. You can fix it. Where should we live now? Oh well... For the time being, it's back to the Pigsty. Oh, Susi. I'm sorry. You can't help it. - Mmm. Are you grinning? - No. * Music: "For a lifetime" by Christian Steiffen * *Sob* # Don't look ahead just look back. # Because I I was your luck # Now you stand there so alone. # And you will never be happy again. # Cry when I go. # I can understand that well. # It certainly hurts a lot # when I see myself like that. # Stay true to me forever. # You will never regret it. # Because the memory of it # is way better than a new man. # Dream of Me # a life long. # Dream of Me # a life long. * Song ends and lively instrumental music * Subtitle: Subtext Berlin, 2020
