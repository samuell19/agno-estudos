I never expected the delicate thread of love to lead me here. I never expected to be bounded to be you, my dear. - Give it to me, brother. - Here. Hello! You didn't buy a ticket today as well. How does it concern you? This bus belongs to my future in-laws. I came in the morning, park my scooter, get into my bus and go to college. I get down there by the bus in the evening, take my scooter and go home. Then why don't you just say that you love me? Why do you keep beating around the bush? Who said that I love you? There are five young boys in your family. I can love any one of them, can't I? Think about it. Do think about it. "I do what I say." "I don't make any false promises." "I do what I say." "I don't make any false promises." "You look like a model." "I look like an amazing actor too." "I wish to write a brilliant story and show it on the sliver screen." "I wish to make a movie on our love story." "I wish to make a movie on our love story." "We will have a few songs in it." "We will go for drives on the motorbike too." "We will have a few songs in it." "We will go for drives on the motorbike too." "I will make a brother-in-law turn into a villain.." "So that I can thrash him in the end." "I wish to make a movie on our love story." "I wish to make a movie on our love story." "With the right attitude, I will kill it." "In the other one I will be Guggu Gill." "With the right attitude, I will kill it." "In the other one I will be Guggu Gill." "You get a beautiful dress stitched.." "You get a beautiful dress stitched.." "I plan to get the perfect outfit stitched too." "I wish to make a movie on our love story." "I wish to make a movie on our love story." "I wish to make a movie on our love story." Bloody hell. You've brought sweets for such a small degree? We'll vanish if this continues. You can take it in writing. We'll starve to death. If this continues. Go and give this back. It's sweet, just like you. Good thinking, grandpa. Just have two and you are done. Grandpa, my future education? Why do you need more education, son? You want to be someone else's slave? You fool, jobs are no good. Look, jobs are for those who don't have anything. You are a Jatt. You have 50 acres of land under your belt. You are well respected. Look at your status. It's a bad thing if it's empty. This one is full, have a look. Don't worry. Today is an auspicious day. Many people will come to you to pay the bill. You will get a lot of money. You tell me, are you going to say yes or no? For what? To fall in love. No, no way. Romance has blacked out since you joined the power department. Don't do this. Be smart about it. Say yes. You have 50 buffaloes. I will have to drug myself before milking them. I am better off like this than romancing like that. No, we're well respected here. I'll be your king and you'll be my queen. We'll have a great life. You stink worse than the cattle do. You think you are well respected, you are a king? Look over there. There comes the Emperor. Grandpa, at least wear proper shoes. You are going to the market. People look at you. Showing off made many kings lose their kingdom. Like this. We will lose 200 acres just like this. Listen.. Why would people look at me anyway? Am I related to them? Showing off is a waste of time. According to me, once you pocket the money, you should never take it out. Even if that results in your death. Yes. You are incomparable. Here's your bag. How much do I owe you? Five sacks of cotton seed cake. A box of tea. - A sack of sugar. - Yes. You owe me 10,200 rupees. Take this. 10,000 is fine. That's the usual amount we always pay. What's this 200 for? Give me a detailed account. - Chotu! - Yes? Go and get the soap. Last time one piece of this soap was ordered. This time eight pieces have been ordered. The new daughter-in-law will make us pauper. I had told them not to get an educated daughter-in-law. Sir, if you want to keep the mare in check.. ..then you should separate it from the horse. Shaunki is an expert at it. He sends people abroad. He will send him abroad. They make more money abroad. Moreover, the mare will be away from the horse. Okay. Have a look. Where is he? What are you doing? Wait, I'll find it. - Come on out! - Find it. Aunt, give me one more. Please give me one more. I've already given you all one each. Get lost now. Here, make me a drink. They must be in it. Where can they go? We will find it. Here, enjoy it. That's enough. - They all want to mug us. - Yes. - He only offered four apples for a kilo. - Yes. Look at this one. We got 16 of these apples for a kilo. Now each member will get a piece each. - True. Look this. - Right, grandpa. Father, why did you have to bring apples? We had it just last month. You could have brought another 5 kilos cotton seed cake instead. You don't let the kids eat well. - Don't worry, let them enjoy it. - Here you go, son. Have an apple. - What's this? - An apple, dear. Enjoy your apple. What is this? An apple. We get such big strawberries at my daddy's house. You call this an apple? It's still an apple. What do I do with it? - Even plums are bigger than this. - Apple! - I saw it first. - Why am I stuck with the misers? - He has put it in his mouth! Wait, you! - No! It's mine. - He ate whole apple. - Come on. Cough it out. Make him stand up. Cough it out. His eyes are popping out. - Spit it out. Yes. - It came out. - I'll eat it. - Good. Greet it properly. Touch both its tyres. It is our saviour. We have 250 acres only because of it. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able.. ..to have enough land to have a cattle shed. You just wait and watch what happens to all of you after I am gone. You all will starve to death. There is no one like you, dear. Here's your dinner, grandpa. I am not your grandpa. Fine, you are not. Why went your anger on food? Eat it. Be a good grandpa and have it. All the time people are showing anger by making sounds. I think we should send Bhaktu abroad. What do you say, Dilip Kaur? Yes, grandpa. This is a great idea. I have a friend in Australia. And my aunt's daughter stays in Canada. And their dollar is pretty strong as well. We both will go to Canada. We won't be able to two people. Bhaktu will go alone. And not to America or Canada.. I'll send him to Doha or Qatar, okay? - Idiot! - Sister-in-law! - Hello? - Stop it. - Mummy? - Why are you getting upset? I am not happy over here. Yes, it would've been better if you had drowned me instead. They get strawberry sized apples. Mummy, you don't know anything. - I have to work all day long. - Wait! Money minded dog. - And now they have come up with a new drama. - I.. They say they will send him to Doha, Qatar. That too alone. Send daddy over with the council members. - That's it. - Oh God. Fine. Okay. - Leave it. - There. My daddy's coming tomorrow. - You just wait and watch. - Listen to me. Our girl has cleared 16 grades, uncle. 16? She has cleared 35 grades. There has to be a reason. Look, there are two bars of soap kept here. That's a fragrant one and this one's the local soap. Look at them and tell me which kid bathed with which soap. Tell me. Grandpa, that contains chemicals. They are harmful for the skin. - We don't want to ruin her skin. - Yes. Then bathe her with curd or buttermilk. And what you just gibbered in English is not true. Right. Get lost! Wait! I agree they are newly weds. But I don't think fragrant soaps will make them love each other more. People used to have 7-8 kids back in the days. There was no lack of love. Nowadays, they do a lot of drama. But they barely manage to have one kid. This is how things are now. Tell me, it's not like I'll take everything with me. I have worked hard to make all the wealth and property. I cannot let it go waste like this. Hey hello! Listen up. Think about it. You will rule. I'll get the same treatment your sister-in-law is getting. Forget it. Just following your ancestors. I want to send him abroad. You should think about your girl. Do you want to let her stay here. Or do you want to take her along? Yes, tell us. Wait, listen to me. Here, keep it in the truck. Lock it up. 50. I was saying.. ..that we should get new clothes stitched for the kids this time? Have you lost your mind, Dilipo? We got them new clothes just a year and a half ago. They only used it for one wedding, Bhakta's wedding. They tore them so soon? You are incomparable. Give me the keys. Here you go. I won't spare your old man. I'll strangle him, you just wait and watch. Don't cry. - I'll be back before you know it. - Okay. - Grandpa, let me handle the bus. - Don't do this. - Enough of goodbyes already. - I will do it. Why is everyone gathered here? You guys are always grumbling. Do you even plan to let him leave? - Come on, let's go. - Bye, grandma. Yes, let's go. - Come. - Where do you think you guys are going? Always following each other like sheeps. - Sit down! - Okay. - Why did you sit down, son? Stand up. - Okay. Go and get the fragrant soaps from inside. - Okay, grandpa. I'll get them. - Go. I'll be going to meet the grocer anyway. I'll return the soaps as well. It will help save some money. Do you plan to stand here forever? Who will get on the plane then? Your father? Let's go. - Why are you sitting on the ground? - Grandpa. - Sit on the bed. - Here you go. - Put it in here. - Open the bag. Put it in. - Let's go, son. - We too want to go with them. Shut up. He wants to go with us. Calm down! Mummy, what have you got me into! Don't cry, sister-in-law. We don't always get what we want. Grandpa didn't let me study further either. I won't let my sister married into this family. I don't know, I don't want her to suffer over here. I'll do it if this old man dies. What is this, sister-in-law? A mosquito net? You filthy man. This too will get burned now. Sister-in-law, why are you burning it? Brother has left, mosquitoes haven't. Aunt, uncle never went anywhere without me. Where has he gone today? He has gone to see off Bhaktu. - Uncle, tea. - Okay. There's your uncle. Oh no, we are ruined! Grandpa's gone! Grandpa! - What's wrong? - Father! Father! Father! How will we live without you? - What's wrong? - What has happened to our afther? Grandpa's gone. Why is grandpa standing like that. He's standing there, but he isn't with us. - Get him out. - Grandpa! - Grandpa! Move. - Father! - Move aside! - Oh grandpa! Lift him up. Pull him up, be careful. - Lift him up. Be careful. - Release his hand. - Lift him up. - Release his hand. - Leave him. - Oh, no.. Bhalla, do one thing. Quickly get a saw. You want to cut his hand? Not his hand, we will have to cut the pipe, Nikka. Where are you, uncle? Oh Paalo, grandpa is dead. We shall no longer live a miser's life. We will lead a good life. - Just say yes. - Shut up. Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Grandpa! Get lost! He was my grandpa as well. Can't she console me as well? Why would she console you? - Grandpa! - Grandpa! - Stay away. - Oh grandpa! Oh grandpa! Big or small, uncle? - Grandpa! - Grandpa? - Grandpa? - Be careful. - Careful, uncle. - Grandpa! Grandpa! Old man, you couldn't take them with you, could you? Good that he is dead. Grandpa got stuck in the bus. Don't you have any shame, you greedy woman? - Shut up. - Grandpa! Hold his hand and get him out. - Lift him up. - Come on. Very good, Nikka. - Be careful. - Come on. Let's go. Be careful. We need record a unique song. Don't worry about the money. My gramps will invest in it. Do you know who will be the lyricist? Jaani or Beat Baljit. We will have Shahnez Gill and Mansi Khurana as the models. Both of them. - Both of them? - Yes. Brother, grandpa is dead. Get aunt along with you and come to the village. My financer is dead. Here, son. Who are they? Ruby's or Gaganveer's? Mother, gramps is dead. Don't worry, mother. Elders leave us in old age. Son, elders can go wherever they want. I am worried about your album. Oh Zaildar! You had said you would die only after you own 2000 acres of land. You died so soon, Zaildar! Oh Zaildar! Uncle has left us! I feel lost, uncle! Stand up, uncle. I am nothing without you. Don't crowd over here. This is my gramps final journey. Please share it. He was going to help me make an album. It will get a little delayed now. I will release the song after his final prayers. Share my gramps. Grandpa is very heavy. We will need to carry the one who is dead. We cannot any other villager instead. The way you are behaving, I doubt you'll lend me your shoulder. - Let's go. Let's go. - They are taking him away. - Uncle! - Grandpa! Be careful. - Be careful. - Father! - Almost there. - Be careful. Boys, his face should be on that side. Like you have been to heaven, Setha. Keep him here and keep him there. - We have kept where we wanted to. - Give it to me. Gather some dry wood. My uncle.. Keep this pure clarified butter in my car. Give me the garland. - Put him this garland. - Be careful. - Here. - Give it to me. Let me go. I want to go with grandpa. I want to go with grandpa. - Don't cry. - I want to go. Go then. Move back, grandpa is too hot. Grandpa. Mother, they have set father on fire. Make sure you use pure clarified butter. Damn you! Don't you have any shame? Idiots! Stay there. I am going. Father is dead. There are so many people at home. If any of us would have been dead.. ..father exactly would know what to do and what not to do. Grandpa didn't like spending money. Let's keep tea and snacks, simple vegetarian food and Jalebis for sweets. - Yes. - Right, uncle? Kola is right. - This is what we should do. - Yes. Like hell he is right. Listen Kola, what do you guys lack in? Father has so much property. You won't die if you will spend some money. We will do everything possible. We will do top class arrangements. You are like the frogs in a pond. My Jagdeep will handle everything. We will rock it, grandma. What else do we have so much money for? We'll have such a great program that everyone will always remember.. ..that it was Jagdeep's gramps final prayers. We will serve patties and pastries. Five types of fritters and sweets. We will have a multi-cuisine buffet. Grandma, we will give the catering contract to Sangam Caterers. After all your gramps can die only once. We will play music and have fun too. Right. Waiter, come here. Yes. Did you try these? - Get me a cappuccino. - Let's go. With cocoa powder in it. - Come, let's enjoy a cappuccino. - Okay. Thousands of people have gathered here to join us in our grief. He is my uncle's son, Nikka. How are you, Nikka? - Say hello to everyone. - Hello. Give a blast! Here mummy, have some cake. Please accept my condolences. Condolences for what? Have you lost your mind? You won't get such a party again. Eat, drink and enjoy yourself. Go and enjoy the patties. Give him some patties. Go and enjoy them. Shanti, tell me about this. Mummy, try this mocktail. - It's delicious. - Try this. Yes? Hey, what are you staring at? If we are doing this kind of arrangement for a funeral.. ..then imagine what we will do for our wedding. My grandpa has saved a lot of money. We will have a grand wedding. You just wait and watch. Smell it. Smell it, come on. What's working? Fog! It works, doesn't it? Not fog, it's the final prayer for grandpa. What are you doing here? Go and handle the relatives. - You handle them. - Why? I like her. I too like her. I like her from before. I like her from the very beginning. Get lost now. Go! Excuse me! Leave! Get lost! Run away! Open your mouth. Open it. "I don't know anyone other than you, my dear." "I don't know how to act smart, my dear." "I don't know anyone other than you, my dear." "I don't know how to act smart, my dear." "You always sit very close to me." "All I see is just you.." "You always sit very close to me." "All I see is just you.." "In my heart." "How are you related to me?" "Let me make the announcement on the speaker." "How are you related to me?" "Let me make the announcement on the speaker." "Let me make the announcement on the speaker." "You are pink, just like the flowers." "You are even lighter than flowers." "Everyone in the village asks me.." "..which village does she hail from?" "You are pink, just like the flowers." "You are even lighter than flowers." "Everyone in the village asks me.." "..which village does she hail from?" "I am generous, my dear." "I am generous, my dear." "I am not counted with the cheaters." "How are you related to me?" "Let me make the announcement on the speaker." "How are you related to me?" "Let me make the announcement on the speaker." "Let me make the announcement on the speaker." Have it all by yourself? How about offering some to others as well? Uncles are sitting over there. I'm going there, to serve them. There. There you go. Come on. Down you go. Here it is. He's kept it as if it feels cold. Let me have a look. - Grandma's stick? - What's this? Here, grandma. Hold it and wait here. Let me talk to them. What were you saying? Mother, boys were saying that we should buy an Innova. And stitch new clothes for everyone. Why? What will you do with the new clothes? We got you new clothes just a year and half ago. Grandpa, you too are wearing new clothes. He's just kidding. Why? Am I his sister-in-law that he will joke with me? Don't joke with me. I'll shoot all of you. I won't give a penny more to anyone. Things will be as they were. - Okay, grandma. - I am a lioness. A lioness's will. A lioness will do as she pleases. Dogs and tomcats cannot even breathe without the lioness's permission. And you? Wasted 700,000 at the old man's funeral! Was it your father's wedding or his funeral? She says, "Mummy, have some cake!" He gave birth to such boys and his daughter pretends to be Sonam Bajwa. Listen up, both of you have lunch and leave. - Bye, aunt. Goodbye. - Bye. Bye. Take your son along. Grandma, how about a selfie? Are you leaving or not? He wants a selfie! - Listen up, boys. - Yes, grandma? Pack all the old man's clothes and throw them at the memorial ground. - Okay. - Okay, grandma. From today, I shall rule this house. Okay. And that junk which is parked over there, sell it as scrap. But mother, it is our Baba. - We sell Baba? - Shut up. Collecting all junk in here. They and their precious Baba. You, go and clean the room. Good that the old man is dead. Bloody miser. I'll have that room locked right away. Kept cribbing all day. We finally get rid of him. These children have nothing else to do except playing. If you ask them to work they run away. Oh God. I am sure it is Nikka. Did you see? What has happened? How did the door fall? Mother. Wait, you bloody bloodsuckers! You will make me go broke! Wait, you.. What is wrong with him? I worked hard all my life. I never even had an orange candy! And those people feasted on my hard earned money! Tell me, when you went to immerse uncle's ashes did you say.. "Come on, let's go father?" - No one said it. - I didn't. There you go then, Nikka's possessed by uncle. He's right in front of you. What is wrong with him? - Nikka! - You! - No, Nikka! - Enough! Nikka! - Father! - Oh no, that's freezing cold water. Not the bucket! - What's going on? - Wait, you.. - Careful there! - There you go! - Grandpa! - Wait. I'll teach each one of you a lesson. - I'll.. - Nikka, what are you doing? Come on, confront me! You have never ever dared to speak a word before me! Now they want to get back at me. I'll break everyone's bones! - Your old man is back. - Hold him down. - Come on. - Let me go. I won't spare anyone. You old woman, you want to rule us? She is the queen! Wait, I'll give you the keys. I had told them not to spend so much. Ask them! Father, please let Nikka go. - Right, let me. - Be a good father. - Let me go! - Father, please let him go. I'll rule everyone! I'll have fun! - Stay back! - Uncle! Oh no, the old man is back. - Father? - Get him, get him. Stop it. - I'll teach all of you a lesson. - Grab him. - Hold him down. Hold him down. - I'll break your bones. - Move aside. - Hold his hand. Hold him. Let me go. Come on. Get lost. - Tie him to the bed. - Come on, take him. - No, no, no. No, father. - Hold him down. - No, don't. - Hold him down. Let me go! Come on father, ask them to untie me. - Father, ask them to untie me. - Be careful. - Secure it. - Father! - Untie him. - Be careful. - Shut up. - Yes. No. Please untie me. - Father! - Take care of him. I am leaving. Father! He broke the bed. He chewed through such a thick rope. - It is uncle for sure. - Oh no. - Aunt, kids these days cannot even eat sugarcane. - Yes. This was done by an old set of teeth. But father didn't have good teeth. Come on brother, you are back to the same thing again? Uncle was always ready to bite all the villagers. And you say he had bad teeth? - Uncle! - Yes? I had come to take the bull. Untie and take him. Okay. We will quickly need to find a solution. Yes. Hello, grandpa. Hello, grandpa. - Greet him. - Hello. Souls don't leave their spots no matter how hard you try, aunt. - Uncle will stay in his room. - Here he is. Make me some tea, mother. It's father. Look at that, mother. He's collecting dung. Come on. Check it out, Jaila. Mangal. What? Throw the shackles around him. Tie him. Go, go, go. He's possessed. Come on! Come on, I've caught him. - Let me go. - Let's go. Let me go. I'll break your bones. - Don't let him go. - Let me go. - Hold him. Hold him tight. - At least tell me what's wrong. What are you doing, father? - Use salt to ward off the evil. - Father! - Be careful, father. - What is wrong, father? At least tell me. At least tell me why have you tied me down. You got possessed by your grandpa last night, son. - Possessed by grandpa? - Yes. No, it's something different. Don't beat me up. I'll explain. Untie me. That's something else. Untie me, uncle. Father, please untie me. Bloody hell, I want to have pizza! Get me a pizza! I want to wear Reebok's shoes and Tommy's shirt! I will do as I please. I spent my life making money.. ..and they didn't take five minutes to cremate me. I'll break everyone's bones. I'll kill all of you. You cannot escape me! Wait, you.. Nikka is possessed by grandpa's ghost. - What? - Yes. I think he'll spend the rest of his life tied up like this. He cannot escape this fate now. Poor guy. Wait, you bloody.. 'When I started trusting him, my love ghosted me.' A bleeding heart makes you write pen strange things. That bloody cruel old man didn't let us be together when he was alive. He isn't let us be together even after his death. Oh God, what do I do now? - Grandma, it hurts a lot. - Enough, son. Enough! Enjoying it, aren't you? What to have some more fun? He wants to be a doctor. Bloody old man, I want him to rot in hell. Don't ask, mother. It is a very sad situation. He bit the young boy. Right. I sing your glory God. I sing your glory among devotees. I sing your glory among devotees. Go, go, gone! Stop. Tell me, will you believe in me if I tell everything about you? Tell me, shall I tell everyone what's the name of your sweetheart? Tell me, shall I tell them who did you watch the movie Shadaa with? Will you believe me then? That's it then, repeat after me. Baba is right and you are wrong. Baba is right and I am wrong. Go then, take offerings. - Okay, Baba. - All the loose links will tie up. Go. - Come on. - Stand up. Tell me the truth. I will solve all your problems. Son, you want to challenge me? Sit down. Tell me, what is the problem. Babaji, he gets possessed by my uncle. He gets possessed by your uncle or a shadow? I will get rid of everything for the right penny. Son, you didn't eat anything? Why are you biting your nails? Babaji, nails won't suffice, he is after our lives. I will eat it! I will eat whatever I want! I will also have your ears. Because I am right and Baba is wrong. Baba is right and.. Hey! You threw Baba's feathers? He is possessed by a strong shadow. It cannot be exorcised in front of a crowd. I will take him to my cabin. There I will go one on one with him and get rid of the shadow. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. Let's go! I'll eat you. I'm telling you, I'll eat you. Keep it down. "I'll eat you." Tell me what's the problem. Speak up. I will talk in your favour, you idiot. Tell me. Baba, first the old man didn't let us do anything. After the old man died, I thought things would change. But that didn't happen, then the old woman became her reign. We are still where we are. Last night I got hold of old man's liquor bottle. 'We didn't get shots even when we had fever.' 'They drank shots worth 30,000.' I got drunk and cursed them. I went all out. When I woke up in the morning and tried to tell them the truth.. ..no one came close to me out of fear. I thought this is a good way to have fun. Then I started doing this drama. Right? Done. Baba shall help you. Don't overact out there. Do as I say. If I ask you to keep quiet, you'll keep quiet. Let's go. - "Hail the Baba who.." - Enough. - Mother! - Yes? I have your boy under control. - Enough. - Hail the Baba! - You will no longer shout. - Okay. You will not do anything. I won't do anything to everyone. - Tell everyone who you are. - Yes. Very good. I am Vaisakha, Dilipo's husband! - Enough! - He's my son! - He held me down! - No! Sit down. - Sit down. - Sit down quietly. I worked hard and made money all my life. Now they are acting like their mother. Enough. Everyone will listen to you. Tell me, what do you want? I want to have a good time. Show me a good time. Will you leave after you have a good time? Yes, I will leave after I have a good time. Mother, get this straight. You need to fulfil all his demands. - Okay. - Secondly! - Okay. - No one will tie him down. - Okay, Baba. - All the family members.. ..need to wear these bells instead. - Yes? - Take this, mother. I'll leave only if I have a good time. I'll take you along if I don't have a good time, Dilip Kaur. All say hail the Baba! Hail the Baba! Aunt, now do you believe in the Baba? Do you believe in Baba? Grandpa. Here. Bloody old man, won't leave us alone even after his death. Look at his behaviour. Only my orders will be followed in this house. - Okay, father. - In jungle, only one lion. - Okay. - Get me Filmy Duniya magazine. - I want to read it. - We'll get it. I want a mobile phone which has a camera in it. - The one which opens like this. - Okay, father. - Better note it down right away. - Yes. I don't want you to say that you forgot. Have fun, father. Have fun. It's not a problem. Make sure your old man has a good time. Your father is here to have a good time. I wonder when will we get rid of this trouble. No grandma, why should we get rid of him? Sages catch ghosts and make them do whatever they want. He is our grandpa. You just wait and watch, he'll find buried treasures for us. - Really? - Yes. You are Alladin. Nikka is the lamp and grandpa is the genie. We will rub Nikka and grandpa will show up. - Yes. - Oh really? He will fold his hands and say "whatever you say, my master." "Whatever you say, my master." You will rule once again. You will be his master. Get lost! What are you looking at? Go away from here! Get lost! Here. Let me tell you, you guys are so slow! I am not having a good time. I asked you to get Filmy Duniya magazine for me. You couldn't even get that for me. And get me a Macdonald's burger too. Otherwise, I'll tie all the calves on the terrace. Moreover.. Do you understand? Father, mother has sent Charan to get the burger. Sudhakar will get the Filmy Duniya magazine from the bus stop by evening. I want to eat the burger right now! Do you understand? Otherwise, I will throw all your drums. I had told you I want to eat momos as well. Let's go, ma'am. Mother has the keys and she has gone to Sarpanch's house. We can get the momos only if we get the money. How about an onion instead? I'll break your teeth. Shut up. Behave yourself, I am warning everyone. Don't make me break your legs. When he was of sound mind, his body was not fine. Now when his body is fine, he has lost his mind. Oh God, why are you against those in love? You sold my tractor Baba. I will sell everything that belongs to you. Stop! Give me the keys to the trunk or else I will eat your kidneys. Come on down. Stop staring at me. Why are you troubling everyone? He hit me hard. - Give him keys. - Why should I give? - I will not give it. - Give him the keys. - Father! - Did you enjoy that? Give me the keys, I said. This idiot has scared everyone and sent them to the terrace. Run away. Come on. No grandma, I am here to take the bull. The bull is standing right in front of you. Take him. Don't come close to me, I am warning you. I'll break all your teeth with a single punch. No, I don't need to invite trouble. - I am warning you old woman, give me my keys. - Give him the keys. You are making me lose my mind. I worked hard all my life and now you are acting like a queen. Do you understand? I will teach everyone a lesson, you old hag. - Give me my keys. - I hold him. I told you not to come here, Mangal. - You don't listen to me, do you? - Wait.. I will not spare you. - I told you, I will.. - You will dislocate his arm. I will not spare you. Why are you staring at me? I will throw everyone away, just like that. Grandma! I have dislocated my shoulder. Eat it. You will not get this chance again. - The ghost didn't leave him as yet? - No, he hasn't. Look at the way he is behaving. He burnt his stomach. Oh no. - Eat some more. - Gandma, the old man has lost it. I am feeling shy even to say it. But he didn't feel shy to say it. 'He said who knows when Bhaktu will come back.' 'Let me help you out.' - I am so unfortunate. - Really? Do you think I am lying? Don't cry. Is it true? Yes, it is true. Why would I lie? I will do as I please. If I wish to help someone out then I will. 'Come on, I felt cold so I asked for a blanket from my sister-in-law.' 'Why do I need to lie about that?' 'My foolish family.' Aunt, we should show him to another sage. This old man is troubling us. - You get ready. Leave the rest to me. - Okay. No. Let me go! I am telling you, let me go! Don't you have any respect for your old man? I don't want to go anywhere. - I.. Let me go. - Come on. I am not possessed by grandpa. I am Nikka. - I'll teach you a lesson. - Let me go, uncle. Take him away. Take the old man away. May you get infested by worms, you devil. May he burn alive. He has been troubling our whole family. - Take this damned man away. - Get in. Hurry up. Immerse them. - Hail the Baba! - Hail the Baba! Hail to thee! - What's troubling you, son? - He gets possessed by our old man. Well done. He says he gets possessed by our old man. I won't go so easily. We will capture him and lock him in a bottle. - How will you put me in a bottle? - No! No! I'll show you how. Come on. Oh damn. You have a lot of current in you. Come on, let's go inside. - No, I won't. - Look at him getting scared. I am not a doctor who will inject you. Come on, let's go. Uncle, I am absolutely fine. Let's go home. Grandpa is no longer here. He is gone. - Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. Father is not here. He has gone. No one is here. I am not possessed! He is getting hyper on purpose. - Such souls don't give up easily. - Let's go, uncle. - No, they don't. - Listen, you have a heavy body. Be strict with him. I am not possessed, why are you hitting me? I will teach you a lesson. This is not right. I will teach you a lesson now. No, uncle. Stop hitting me with your legs. Babaji, what if he again demands for Momos? Then keep a hot coal on his tongue. - Don't fulfil any of this cruel man's demands. - Grandpa, wait. - Nikka! - Get him! - Grandpa! - Stop! Wait! Babaji, they are naive. Please bless them. He isn't ready for my blessings. He is not at all naive. - Nikka! - Stop! Stop! "The one who sees you loses his voice." "It is said that it gets hold of you if you don't run." "You just stepped on the ground and the ground caught fire." "Keep them behind the veil." "Your eyes are as deadly as a double-barrelled shotgun." "Your eyes are as deadly as a double-barrelled shotgun." Babaji, we are here to get a ghost exorcised. Get lost you scoundrels. I get rid of sprains and not ghosts. If you leave the ghost here then where will I stay? Get lost! "She has just come of age." "Her attitude is dangerous." "The men who are unaffected by your beauty are indeed strong." "The black veil and pink dress suits your fair skin." "You are like a bottle of whiskey." "You get the boys high." "You get the boys high." Put this around your neck. Put the garland. Give him the Ladoo. - Here, have the ladoo. - Have it. - Shall I eat it? - Eat it. Go ahead and eat it. Grandma is here. Oh my beloved, leave this kid alone. What is this nonsense? Are you guys fools? What the hell is this? You are messing up all relations. Get up, grandma. He didn't let me sit next to him when he was young. Why would he let me sit next to him now, bloody pain in the neck? These are the rituals. Give the bride's hand into the bridegroom's hand. Wait, I'll teach you the rituals! I won't spare you, you impostor! Wait! Let me go! I'll teach you a lesson. - I won't spare him! I will kill him. - Don't kill him. Wait, you.. Wait, you.. One minute! He isn't going anywhere. He's here to trouble us. I assure you. "She has hair extensions longer than a snake." "She leaves them breathless, the one she looks at." "She has each and every boy under her control." "Everyone's talking about.." "They are talking about finding a cure for the spells you cast." "They are talking about finding a cure for the spells you cast." "They are talking about finding a cure for the spells you cast." "They are talking about finding a cure for the spells you cast." Brother? Are you Nikka or are you grandpa? - I think he is grandpa. - Yes. Tell us! - Get lost! - Oh, no.. Grandma, he is possessed by grandpa. Look, the Babajis will do what they can do. I think you should get him medically treated as well. Heed my advice, and administer electric shocks. Grandma! - Dear, please drop me home. - Sure. Very good. - Hold him down. Hold him down. - Be careful! Hold him down. Hold him down. - Don't make me kill you. - Hold him down. Go ahead, doctor. Go on, go on. - Hold him down. - Careful! Oh damn, uncle is back. Madam, I have done what you'd asked me to do. Thank you, Mr. Jasbir. Are you sure? Don't worry, madam. We won't restore the power back of that place till night. Okay. Oh thank you, Babaji. We have been waiting for seven hours. When will they restore the power? Start the generator and get the job done, doctor. Generator isn't working, sir. - There you go. - There you go. We will need to take him to another Baba now. Aunt? - Yes? You shouldn't be superstitious. He is Nikka. And he is not possessed. He is small. - But the enemy inside him is very big. - Yes. We burnt 5 quintals of wood. And yet he is living inside him. Our work would have been done if not for that power cut. Right. Grandpa, did the doctor give an electric shock to the old man? He was useless. He didn't know anything. He said he is not possessed by the old man. Who is he possessed by if not the old man? Listen, why don't we give him an electric shock at home? It's very simple. We will join the wires and throw them on him. Yes, grandma. No, mother. Please don't do that. My son will die. That's a good idea too. Let's kill him. We'll get rid of the trouble. There is no shortage of men in our house. There are too many to count. You never know the enemy. What if he kills everyone one by one? Didn't you see what happened to Mangal? I beg to you mother, spare my son's life. I am not a fool. Grandsons are always dearer than sons. I am saying this with a heavy heart. Mother, why kill him? He is my nephew after all. You will get an extra 10 acres of land. I'll give his share of land to all of you. - No, mother. - No, uncle. No. How can sons say no to their mother? - God said it so let's do it. - Hold him. What are you guys discussing out there? Hear me out. Don't worry, aunt. He won't even feel the current. - Here my boy, have it. - What is it, grandma? It's mango shake, come on have it. Which idiot grew mangoes in winter? - I won't have it. Take it away. - Hold him down. I won't have it. Take it away. Let me go! No! No, grandma! Grandma! Please share the video. This is gramps final journey. You will never see him again. But let me show it to you live today. Gramps family has gathered around him. - Come on friends, we are live. - No grandma, let him go. We will all go to jail if anything happens to him. That idiot has gone live on the internet. - Gramps won't come back! - Bloody idiot! Grandma! Brother, they will exorcise gramps' ghost out of you. What will they exorcise out of me? The artist. Here, drink it. Do you remember, when Makhan got married.. ..I sang for you. We were newly married back then. You didn't like to go to the fields. You used to make excuses and come home. You used to love me a lot. Now place your hand on your heart and tell me, don't you love me at all? What are you saying, grandma? I am feeling shy. You stupid, you are my husband. I have done more work for you than the hair on my head. You never let me rest in peace. I beg to you, my enemy. Please go away. Grandma, I am Nikka. I will take you to bad Babas. Aunt, let's take him to the Chimtewale Baba. - No grandma, take me to the Pizza Baba. - Wait, you scoundrel! I'll get you pizza. 'Hail to Baba Tong.' - Hold him. - Hail to the Baba! Come on. - Hold him. - Let go! Let me go! Go on! Go on! Let me go! You have done many miracles, Baba. Let me go! You have helped many, Baba. Stop! Bless us Babaji. Tell me, who are you? I won't leave him! Try your best! This is your last warning. You will later beg to leave and I won't let you go. I'll lock you in a bottle and bury 10 feet underground. Tell me! Don't do this drama and tell me your name. Beat him with the tongs. Come on! "There she surrenders!" "Spare me, Oh Baba!" "There she surrenders!" - "Spare me, Oh Baba!" - Tell me, who are you? - I am his wife. Sukhchan Kaur. - Hail the Baba! Why have you possessed your husband? Why don't you leave? - So much love? - It's not love. He will marry someone else if I let him go. I won't let him leave a peaceful life. You cannot escape. Who are you? Dimple. The Chimtewale Babaji is my father. There is nothing wrong with me. Please let me go. Relax. I know there is nothing wrong with you. There is nothing special about my dad either. It's his business. People believe in him. But this isn't the path you should choose. Where will you run to? To your house? They will bring you back here. Then dad will use the tongs on you more freely. There is really nothing wrong with me. I swear. I promise by this tree. I am absolutely fine. I know. You are such a beautiful soul. A look at you is enough to know how good you are at heart. You don't need to do anything. Just go in there and touch dad's feet in front of everyone. He won't do anything to you. One more thing. If you need anything then approach me. I will help you. Okay? 'You stink worse than the cattle do.' Do you think that I smell bad? Flowers are always fragrant. Carry on. Babaji, ask him to drink less. He doesn't drink. The one who has possessed him drinks. Offer an offering of 51,000. And he will get better. Babaji, I will be able to give 51,000 only after the harvest. Fine, first take care of your wheat and then come back. Then I will cure him. Come on, let's go. - I don't want to. - Why don't you want to? Leave me. Come on, stand up. Move aside. Grandpa! Uncle, grandpa ran away! - Uncle, grandpa is gone. - What happened? - Babaji! - Father is gone? Nikka is back. Nikka is back. - Babaji! - Nikka is back. - He is back. Nikka.. - Hail to the Baba! Grandpa is going away, there he is. He is gone. Did you see your father leave? No. I didn't see him leave. - I saw him. - I too saw him. He came out from Nikka left's ear and went there. Yes, Babaji. He came out of Nikka, he fell, he dusted his clothes and ran away. Uncle, he must have gone to relieve himself. Shall we take some water for him? Did you see the miracle Babaji just performed? All say hail to Chimtewale Babaji. All say hail to Chimtewale Babaji. "There she surrenders!" "Spare me, Oh Baba!" "There she surrenders!" "Spare me, Oh Baba!" Listen to me.. Be careful. Hail to the Baba! How much should we offer prayers worth? 100,000? 100,000. Here you go, 100,000. Counting them isn't auspicious. Something worth millions was done by him for mere thousands. Okay. Hail to the Baba! Hail to the Baba! Babaji, always be this generous. Hello, Ambo. Hello, brother. Is Nikka doing well, sister? Bullshit. Nikka is doing well. You don't listen to them. Your husband didn't leave, Ambo? He left, brother. They say that he left. He gave me the keys. He was here to trouble us like a deadly snake. - Really? - Have some tea. You should have shot the snake, mother. He would have danced to your tunes then. Get lost. Your daughter is so good. Why do you act like crazy? Stop this stupidity and behave yourself. - You know what he told me last night? - What? He said Shanti, let me drink through your eyes. And he is back. Nikka, what you said about drinking last night, it's true, right? Yes, my thirst quenched after drinking it. 'Come on, I was thirsty.' 'I asked sister-in-law to get me some water.' 'Why would I lie about it?' Hey, hello! Look, I am still waiting for you. Say yes now. If you ever try to stop me again, then look at these slippers. I'll beat all the kings and emperors out of you. You stinky fellow. Stay away from me. 'Flowers are always fragrant.' - Grandma, grandpa has possessed me again. - Really? I saw him enter me through my navel. You should take me back to the Chimtewale Baba. They said he left through your ears. My husband isn't so strong to come here. Don't worry. Go to sleep. Everyone go to sleep. You keep talking till late hours. And then you refuse to wake up in the morning. Give me the bag. - Stop, stop, stop. - I will show this photo to grandma. Grandma, this is my sister. She is beautiful, isn't she? Yes dear, she is very sweet. She is short puppy like ears. Nikka! Come here. Come, I'll show you your future wife. Come on. He is feeling shy. Come here, son. Look at this. What do you say? She's fat, grandma. She is healthy. She will work well. It's not like you want to expose her stomach and make her act in movies. Hey girl, go and tell your mother that the lioness likes her. We shouldn't worry about the cats and the dogs here. Go and tell your mother to start making preparations. Okay, grandma. Go and work with your father. Go away. Hello? Yes, mummy? Everything is fixed. Yes, he will be back for the wedding. Why will he come back? Let him stay abroad. And let your sister stay where she is. I'll marry you. And I'll also buy you colourful mosquito nets. Old infested old man! You are back! Get lost. - Grandma, grandpa is back! - He come back! Grandma, grandpa is back! Wait.. where are you going, Shanti? Wait, let me put the sheet on you. What's the big deal. I'll tell you what's the big deal. Are you going to behave or should I.. Get lost, fatso. - Father? - Grandpa is back. Give me the keys back, Dilipo. I'll set everything on fire. I am a lion. A lion will do as he pleases. I will eat momos. Everyone, get this straight. I will also have pizza. And do not take me to the Chimtewale Baba. You can take me anywhere else you want. I don't care. This troublemaker is back. - What do you think..! - Father! Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. 'Flowers are always fragrant.' All say hail to Chimtewale Babaji. Chant in your heart the name of Babaji. Babaji! Babaji! - Stop. - Babaji! Babaji! You know everything. Babaji! - Enough. - Babaji! Great soul, keep me with you. I get possessed by my grandpa when I go home. You are omnipresent. Let me stay at your feet, Babaji. Make him one of the helpers. You too stay with him. Okay, Babaji. Hail to the Baba! Hail to the great soul! You love the poor and the lovers. Hail to the Baba! Hail to the Baba! Hey, mend your ways. Hail to the Baba! Hail to the Baba! Hail to the great soul! "I'll buy you a mini cooper." "You can go on rides whenever you want." Do some work. Why does it hurt you? I won't go to work. You don't know the Jatts. I can earn one year's wages through my shoulder. You don't know the Jatts. They don't let you sit idle. Collect the dung, feed them fodder, sweep the floor. Wash the tractor. They order me around like I am their servant. They give me 125,000 a year. And they squeeze even the last drop of life out of me. If you pull a raddish out of their field by mistake.. ..forget the men even the women will try to strangle you. And they will pay the agents any money the ask for. Give a small push and they will showering money. Anyway forget it. Come here, my sweetheart. Let's make a video on tiktok. Come on. Come here, my sweetheart. "My heart isn't that cheap that you can buy it with a wink." You sit here, I'll go and get 10,000 from grandma. Okay? Grandma, Nikka has made me handicap. My shoulder dislocates as easily as a doorknob moves. I am as good as dead, grandma. Grandma, I cannot even lift a basket anymore. No one will hire me now. I have 5-7 kids. I will die of starvation. I am become useless. Don't cry, go release the bull. You have lost your mind.. ..from the time you started wearing bells around your feet. You are strange. How can I release a bull when I cannot even release my drawstrings? Grandma, do one thing, give me some money and ask me to get lost. Damn you! Major, give him 2000 and ask him to leave. I think you have lost your mind. 2000 rupees? I want to get my shoulder treated and not buy anklets. Zaildar, at least give me 10,000 rupees. Have you forgotten that you are Zaildars? - Major! - Yes, mother? Give him 10,000 rupees and get rid of him. - Long live Zaildarni! - Get lost! - Long live Zaildarni! - Leave. - Let's go, Mangal. I'll give you the money. - Okay. Ouch! Chimtewale Baba is great. What are you doing here? Go and wash the utensils. I like her. I like her too. I like her before you. I like her from the first day. Get lost. Go and wash utensils. Nikka.. You'll get infested with worms. Oh no! What? I thought you hurt yourself with the scissors. No, it's your eyes that have pierced through my heart. If I was crazy, I wouldn't go crazy after seeing you. I too like you. Can I hold your hand? Forget my hand you can also hold my ankle. Now I am all yours, my love. "Got trapped when you looked at me, this simple naive Jatt." "Everything seems beautiful now, he keeps twisting his moustaches." "He has loudspeakers on his terrace now." "You better watch out girl." "Tell me, what did you like?" "The boy or his nature?" "I dance on my terrace." "I am so excited." "Tell me, what did you like?" "The boy or his nature?" "You have started blushing." "It is a sight to watch out for." "He will fulfil all your wishes." "That's why he has started saving every penny." "You have started blushing." "It is a sight to watch out for." "He will fulfil all your wishes." "That's why he has started saving every penny." "With each breath I take your name." "Tell me, what did you like?" "The boy or his nature?" "I dance on my terrace." "I am so excited." "Tell me, what did you like?" "The boy or his nature?" "The words you say are sweeter than honey." "Even sun isn't bright enough against your bright clothes." "The words you say are sweeter than honey." "Even sun isn't bright enough against your bright clothes." "The path to your village seems more beautiful than heaven." "Tell me, what did you like?" "The boy or his nature?" "I dance on my terrace." "I am so excited." "Tell me, what did you like?" "The boy or his nature?" "I dance on my terrace." "I am so excited." "Tell me, what did you like?" "The boy or his nature?" - Listen? - Yes? Tell me something, are you possessed or are you doing a drama like me? Help me out as well. Ask her if she has a single aunt. Have some shame. Look at your age first. Why should I feel ashamed? I became a widower at a young age. My relatives didn't let me remarry. What else am I supposed to do? Be a good brother and help me out. - Get lost. Stop troubling me. - Oh really? Now you wait and watch. People, he's eloping with Baba's daughter! Look at this, Baba! He's going after your family. He has gone crazy! He wants to ruin your life. Yes, surround him! Surround him! Get him! Get him! No, no, no. - Yes. Get him. Now you will learn a lesson. I suspected you when you said that I am omnipresent. Babaji.. My grandpa has saved a lot of money. I want to get married. Please don't beat me up. I like your daughter. 'I don't think he's a bad boy.' 'He is from a good family too.' 'He also has wealth and property.' 'He is perfect for Dimple.' 'My daughter will rule his household.' There is only one way to cure him. Get him married. The soul will leave the body after the wedding. Babaji, Shanti wants her younger sister to marry him. It's difficult. It's very difficult. It is possible that the girl dies after the wedding. No grandma, I won't let my sister marry him. Babaji said she can die. Why should I sacrifice my sister for that cruel old man? I am not going to let her marry him. Come on. Guide us, oh great soul. Show them the right path. Who will let his daughter marry him? He has got a bad name in the village. I will sacrifice my daughter. This isn't a bed of roses, it's a bed of thorns. It is very easy to be called a Baba. But it is difficult to be one. I am here to help the mankind, Charna. It's true. I'll get my daughter married to him. - Go, you have been blessed. - Congratulations, aunt. All say hail to Chimtewale Babaji. He is so lucky. Even I would like grandpa to possess me. Hail! 'He will die.' "Chimtewala Babaji gets rid of our worries." 'This is what the Baba wanted.' "Chimtewala Babaji shows us the right path." We'll wear matching colours, pink. You can wear pink lehenga. I will wear a pink turban. Whatever you say. I'll do as you say. We could go with maroon too. I'll wear a Nabhi turban and you can wear a maroon lehenga. You will look beautiful no matter what you wear. You can wear whatever you want. I am covered in your hues now. Nikka? We have booked Labh Heera. He has taken 80,000 rupees. He will rock the party. You just wait and watch. And also write my name on your palm with henna. You cheat! Hey! You? It's not my fault. You didn't listen to me when I kept following you. Now you are acting like a victim. How am I supposed to know when you are possessed and when you are not? I cannot marry a ghost, can I? I kept writing poetry for you. "I didn't know this would happen.." "I didn't know this would happen.." "After your wedding, I'd wither away like a flower saddened." Hey liar, that's Davinder Kohinoor's song. But the feelings are mine. I will write our names on every tree. I am begging to you. Please don't embarrass us. Don't ruin our happiness. Go away. Nothing can be done now. Get lost. Mummy! We have booked Labh Heera. We will have a lot of fun. Forget the singer and tell me about the catering. Catering? Sangam Caterers from Patiala. Okay. But the decoration guys will come from Chandigarh. Hold on. Listen.. What do I listen to? We are betrothed. We are getting married in 10 days. We are getting engaged day after tomorrow. What is it? Ghosts are a bad thing. There are no ghosts inside me. I was acting. Yes, I know. You are not possessed. But Baba's daughter is possessed. 'No, it's your eyes that have pierced through my heart.' You swear? - Couldn't you tell me any sooner? - I did warn you. Listen to me, listen to me.. Did you listen to me? No. Now enjoy ghosts at a witch's wedding. Who knows even your grandpa might show up. Here son, exchange the rings. - Exchange the rings, son. - No grandma, I don't want to. - Do it, Nikka. - Do it, son. Grandma.. Nikka, be a good son and sit down. Take this. I won't do it, grandma. - I'll slap you. - Do it. - Do it. - Do it. Do it, Nikka. Look over there. Nikka, hold her hand. She is yours. She isn't a stranger. Be a little romantic. Nikka, sister-in-law is so beautiful. Your feet won't touch the ground on your wedding night. Come closer, dear. Do it, son. Say something, Nikka.. Have it, dear. Have it. - Brother, garland him. - Here, grandma. Good. That's great. Wear it, son. Look at it. It's made from currency notes. Grandma is putting it wrong. Congratulations, grandma. - There you go. Congratulations! - Congratulations to everyone! - Congratulations! - There you go. - Congratulations to you too. - Heartily congratulations! Wait. Wait. What is it? Last night I felt every lamp that you lit burning my heart. Now I have realised who will be with me, you aren't with me? Isn't this that baldie's song? But the feelings are genuinely mine. I cannot live without you. You can go and tell everyone in your village. Write our names on every tree and every leaf. We don't need to fear the world. I am touched, Nikka. But no. Now it will be as God wills it to be. Separation is a sign of true love, Nikka. In our hearts, we will be together till our last breath. Our souls love each other. No! You go for it. I will handle the rest. Let me go. No, Nikka. I am a woman. Being a woman, I cannot ruin another woman's life. May you lead a happy life. Have fun, my love. Mummy! I don't feel hungry anymore. I don't feel thirsty either. Oh, come on. Brother! Whether you are grandpa or Nikka or anyone else. - Please spare some for poor guys like me as well. - Get lost! You are grandpa. He's after my life. All the seven dresses the girl has stitched are in black. Tell me, what colour Sherwani do you want for the wedding? A white one. And a white shawl too. She is a witch, she is bound to go for black. I beg to you, say no to them. - I don't want to get married. - Right. Hear that. You don't know about yourself and you keep accusing others? She is beautiful. - Just like an angel. - Here, have it. She is possessed! She is no angel. Okay, grandpa. You two ghosts can have a good time. And these two bodies will be together. Okay? You guys can pair up. - Oh no. - No! The enemy is getting hyper again. He knows he has little time left. Look at him making excuses. - It's okay. - There are just two days left. Have some more fun. Baba said you will leave forever as soon as they get married. Where is Shanti? Upstairs, grandpa. - Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. - It's okay. Tease her as much as you can for the next two days. Her husband will be back as well. 'He is having a good time.' 'He has Baba's daughter under his control.' 'He is romancing that girl with the scooter too.' 'They don't tell him anything even when he teases sister-in-law.' 'And I?' Hello? Yes, mummy. He is coming. Yes, he will come soon. Yes. No, I am fine. I am not going to marry anyone, Shanti. I'll make you my wife. I like you. I am sure. I want Shanti. May you get infested with worms. - Move aside, let me go. - I won't. - Nikka, please, let me go. - I won't. - Nikka, please, let me go. - Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi! - Nikka, please, don't do this. Please, let me go. - Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Wait, you.. Brother! Brother! Brother, I was playing Kabaddi. Wait, I'll turn you into Khushi Duggan Wala. I kept extracting oil day in and day out in Qatar.. ..and you are trying to steal away my wife? No, brother. No. Over there they gouge out the eyes of those who eye other men's wives. - I'll teach you a lesson. Wait, you.. - No, no, no. Brother! - No, no, no! - He wants to play Kabaddi. "Buy me a mosquito net, these mosquitoes are killing me." - "Buy me a mosquito net.." - Stop it. I spent six months in well because of all this. I have brought a burqa for you. Come, I'll show it to you. Yes. 'They won't lose anything, you will lose your life.' 'I need to put more power into my acting.' 'I am a lion. I will do as I please.' Scoundrels, I am a lion. - I will do as I please. - Oh, damn! - Lion is here to have fun. - What is wrong with him? - Be careful. - Wait, you lioness! I won't let any lioness rule. I will rule this house. I want to eat momos! I will buy new suit! I will buy new jeans pants! Wait, you.. Wait, I want jeans! I want a mobile phone! - I will do as I please! - What is wrong with him? I will get married three times. - Grandma, we had just one grandpa. - I will get married three times. Who is he possessed with? - By the way, he too is very hyper. - I won't let anyone rule. No, grandma! No, no, no! No grandma! Let me go, uncle! Let me go, father! - No, no, no. - Open your mouth! - Show it! Open your mouth. - No, no, no. I said open your mouth. He is after our lives. He has possessed him now. They are our boys and not some pyjamas.. ..that you keep changing them as you like. Get me a pair of scissors, boy. I'll cut off his ears. Here, mother. No, please don't do it. No. No, take it away. - Is he possessing you now? - No grandma, not as yet. Get me married, I will leave. I dare him to show up. Now I know how this works. - What kind of a crazy game is this! - Enough. Grandma, I will leave without any sacrifices. Why are you sacrificing his ears? Calm down. He is talking about sacrificing the ears. - Uncle, be careful. - I am a lioness. I will rule this place. It's okay. "He showers money over me, when brother-in-law sees me dancing." "He showers money over me.." "He stayed out for 12 years.." "He stayed out for 12 years.." "He came back with stars." "I am ruined." "May you lead a happy life, my love." "I am ruined." "May you lead a happy life, my love." "I am ruined." "May you lead a happy life, my love." "I am ruined." "May you lead a happy life, my love. I am ruined." "The one who doesn't dances is crazy." "The one who doesn't dances is crazy." "I am not going to survive!" "Why won't you survive?" "My beloved kept asking me everywhere." "Yes or no?" "I am not going to survive!" "Why won't you survive?" "I am not going to survive!" "Why won't you survive?" "Why won't you survive, dear?" "Why won't you survive?" "My parents gifted me all the jewellery." "My parents gifted me all the jewellery." "His family gifted me only one talisman." "Whenever he fights with me, he asks me to remove it." Tell me, how is it my fault? I don't want anything. I didn't demand dowry. I only wanted you. I loved you. That woman's life is going to get ruined even if I die. But it's okay, true love should win. Love should survive. No Nikka, please don't do that. This is what I will do. There is a wooden ladder on the backside. See for yourself. Save me if you can, otherwise it's my final goodbye to you. You will keep remembering me day and night. Wait a minute. Isn't that Harbhajan Mann's song? Whoever's it is. How does it concern you? The rope hanging on the backside is mine. "He stayed out for 12 years.." That's grandpa's girlfriend. Grandpa's going to marry someone else tomorrow. Then there's grandpa's first wife, our grandma. She is already at home. Grandpa has three women in his life. Well done, grandpa. I am proud. Of the fact that I am your grandson. Honestly, you are on fire. Nikka! Nikka! You are here. You are late. What if I was already dead? You'll die with this? Drama! I knew you would show up. No one can stop true love from uniting. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go. No! There is a knot in the drawstring. It's nothing. Don't worry. Let's go. No. "I'll bravely whisk you away." "I won't leave this on fate." "I'll bravely whisk you away." "I won't leave this on fate." "I won't leave this on fate." Father, enjoy the moment. Bye, Dilipo! Come on, let's go. - Run, run, run! - What happened? Look grandma, your husband's eloping with the druggie's daughter. Oh, my God! Brother, we will get a new mummy? I cannot say about the new mummy. But I can say that I will kill your old daddy for sure. What is wrong with it? I think we are out of gas. You knew we were eloping. Couldn't you fill the tank? I had. Brother Satveer must have sold it to buy drugs. I think there are some cars coming this way. Let's run away. Come on, run. Grandma? I was telling.. Zaildarni, you have ruined our reputation. Like you had a very good reputation. You cannot even walk straight. And you claim that your reputation has been ruined. Your daughter didn't leave alone. She left with my husband. Come what may, whether it's your father or your son.. ..we will kill him for sure. How can you kill him? Didn't you know back then when she used to come.. ..to our house every day to park her scooter? It was like tempting gunpowder with fuel. It caught fire, now enjoy yourself. Now listen to us. Law is standing right here. - What's the boy's age? - Why? Do you have a wedding proposal for him? Do the work you are here for. Police has surrounded you from all sides. Come out for your own good. Why have you surrounded him? Do you think he is Jeona Morh? Stop barking like that. Give it to me. Give it here. Come on out, my husband. Otherwise, I'll have you crushed along with the sugarcanes. In movies, usually they show a song in such a situation. Keep quiet. You will get us into trouble. They will break our bones if we get caught. Keep quiet. So what, Nikka? If not alive, we will be together after death. True love. You are so naive? Father, I had told you not to buy her a scooter. If you hadn't she wouldn't have left. We would've been able to buy more drugs.. ..with the money you spent for the scooter. We wouldn't have to worry about drugs for a couple of months. What are you saying? - Let's go get them. - Let's go. Go for it. Grandma.. Nikka! You cannot escape now. Oh, my God! We got rid of him. They killed my son. - Police! - Don't Move! What happened? Did you kill him? He snatched the gun from me. Disgusting child. - Grandma! Grandma, listen to me. - Yes? What reward will I get if I catch Nikka? You can keep the bull, son. - Really? - Yes. - Go. - Mangal, it is a good deal. Now Mangal will have Nikka shackled. I'll get a buffalo for 100 too. Oh, so you are enjoying sugarcanes over here. - Well done. - What are you doing here? I am here to take the bull. Come here. Shall I help you up? Wait, I'll get you the bull. How many times have I told you to not interfere? Do you want the bull now? Where am I? Nikka! The bull has gone wild! Mangal, you know how Nikka is. Why did you get beaten up? You got the bull? You can take cash from grandma. I am dead. - I am doomed. - Grandma, he is back. - I am ruined, grandma. - Where's Nikka? - I got beaten up. - Where's Nikka? Grandma, you handle this on your own. It doesn't concern this poor man. My children will become orphan. Get this straight, grandma. You should get rid of these bullets. You don't have that kind of power anymore. What will I do with your bull? I am starving. I am hungry. Give me food. Sage, stop your daughter. What will we do if he runs away with two girls? Babaji, you know everything. You know what will happen next, don't you? This is all fate. Whatever it is... Babaji, this is fun. If you had not taken so long to reply.. ..then we wouldn't have to face this day. So it is my fault? Fine, it is my fault. Look sister, we have made a mistake. But we love each other since college times. We just tried to act arrogant with each other. You are so beautiful. You can have anyone you want. But she will die without me. I went a little off track. I love her. I like you. I won't spare you for the next seven lifetimes. But I am a woman. And being a woman.. ..I cannot break another woman's heart. Sister! Please save us from your father. Let's go. 'Thank God.' 'This thing about girls is very nice.' 'They always think a lot about each other.' There you go. Grandpa is back. Grandpa is back, uncle. - Look at my new grandma. - Come. They are back, aunt. - Shoot him! - Exorcise his ghost! We'll show him the consequences of eloping with someone. Kill him. Dad! Dad, please tell them the truth. Otherwise, these naÃ¯ve people will kill them both. What are you waiting for? Shoot him. Dad, please. Look, 50% of the people you bring to us.. ..are pretending to be possessed just like Nikka did. They stop the drama once they fear they'll get beaten up. And I get praised. What is this? Now whether there are ghost in this world or not... God alone knows that. Honestly speaking, I have no idea about it. You... This is new. He says Nikka isn't possessed. Who told you that he is possessed? Charna. He is the one who spread the rumour across the village too. Malha, you are mistaken. Come on, you are acting strange. How am I mistaken, huh? Let's get Baba and Charna. He is the one who takes people to such places. - Get them! - Come here, you thug! Wait! Why are you causing such a racket? Are you stupid that you blindly followed him? It is our fault. There are beautiful Gurudwaras in every village. We should go there and pray. We keep sending truckloads of almonds, cashews and sugar to the Babas.. ..even when we can't a square meal for ourselves. I too just realised this. Fools, you used to burn lamps in his favour when he was lying. Now you want to kill him when he is telling the truth? And you? I'll shoot you if you do such a drama again. Go home, girl. Brother, you go and start making preparations. We are coming over with our guests. How can we just get them married right away? We need to do a lot of work. Did you think about work when she had eloped? Listen up. Let me know if you want to give us your daughter.. ..otherwise, we will marry him to Baba's daughter. We are paupers. We don't have money to buy drugs. We don't have dollars lying around in our house either. Do as she says. It will be better for us, brother. Charna, you would have gotten my son killed. Major, I am your brother. Do brothers behave like this, you devil? Get him! Beat him up! - Get him! - Aunt! Nikka, I am your uncle. Babaji, perform a miracle. - Get him! - Spare me! I won't take anyone to the Baba's henceforth. Let go of her hand or you will get into trouble. Come on, give me the keys. I lost the keys, grandma. It's okay, we will break the lock of the trunk. - We will break it. - Yes. Friends, we are live now. There are 500 people with us. My uncle's son has done a brave thing. Say hello to everyone. She is my sister-in-law. She is great. Talk to my grandma too. We will party later. He has a bad nature. He cannot talk well. Are you alright? Okay, you saw how everything worked out at my grandma's place. I am so happy. Gary? Here, hold him. Come here. Oh my handsome boy. Yes, yes. - Say papa. - Come on, let's go. Say it. What's your name, son? - What's my boy's name? - Tell her. Vaisakha! Damn! You cannot escape! There is nothing wrong with me. Let me go. Relax, I know there is nothing wrong with you. "After spending three years in Canada, o' beautiful..." "I have come back after planting berries there." "I couldn't do anything about it you just drove pass me." "After planting potatoes among eucalyptus trees, I cried on GT road." Shall I sing Angrez Beat song? Isn't that Honey Singh's song? Come on, I wrote the song. He just added music to it. You don't know the power of a pen, you fool. Give me your hand, let me explain. Forget my hand, you can hold my ankle. I will. I belong to you now, my love. You can hold them. You won't hold them? Go ahead. Oh damn, run for your life! "My life has become colourful once again." "Your charm has worked it's magic." "My life has become colourful once again." "Your charm has worked it's magic." "I have put all my arms and ammunitions under lock and key." "Now I only use the weapon called love." "I swear you have changed me." "Now I wander around like a man possessed." "Now I wander around like a man possessed." "Now I wander around like a man possessed." "I planned a candle light dinner for us close to the well." "I have filled the village with lamps." "I have filled the village with lamps." "I dream about our future together." "Just like the soldiers dream about the army." "I swear you have changed me." "Now I wander around like a man possessed." "Now I wander around like a man possessed." "Now I wander around like a man possessed."
