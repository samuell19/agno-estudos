[air whooshing] [wind whirring] [bats screeching] [wings flapping] [upbeat music] [ship whooshing] [ship crashing] - Hello little people! [upbeat music] I'm your host, Katey Sagal. You know me from "Futurama," but what you probably have never seen is the failed TV show "Giantess Attack," one of the many 1990's ripoff of the popular show, Super Power Morph, range, whatever, you remember that show. [chuckles] "Giants Attacks" offered up less-guided mashup of "Ultraman" and foot fetish videos. Although 24 episodes were filmed, this cringe-worthy sexist slop was pulled after just two episodes and replaced with reruns of, you guessed it, "Married with Children." "Oh, Al." So let's jump back to the '90s with zippo zammo. Is that what they? [chuckles] Are we done? Great. Can you make that check out to Katey Sagal? Yeah, my agent doesn't need to know about this actually. Actually, do you have cash? ♪ Four, three, two, one [upbeat music] ♪ Zippo, Zammo ♪ Earth under attack ♪ Monsters from space ♪ Loser actors ♪ Time to save the human race ♪ Don't go ♪ Giantess Attack ♪ Smash, smash ♪ Giantess Attack ♪ Crush, crush ♪ Giantess Attack ♪ Kick 'em where it counts ♪ Big boss will hire you to play Minnie Mouse ♪ ♪ Now you delusional divas are bigger than a house ♪ ♪ Don't go ♪ Giantess Attack ♪ Don't go ♪ Giantess Attack ♪ Don't go - [Announcer] Brought to you by.

[upbeat music] [wind howling] - [Narrator] My life fades. The vision dims. All that remain are memories. I remember a time of great chaos. Ruined dreams. A wasted land. But most of all, I remember, Diedre and Frida, the Giantess Attack team. To understand who they were, you have to go back to the previous episode. [upbeat music] On our last episode, Diedre and Frida's substance-abuse problems cost them their jobs on the show, "Battle Babe and Combat Queen." The show was canceled. The director and crew were now unemployed and vowed revenge. Twin space fairies called the Metalunans gave the girls magic wands called BetaMax capsules. These capsules gave Diedre and Frida the ability to grow giant and fight monsters threatening the Earth. The drunken duo set the fairies on fire, grew giant, battled the military, and left Hollywood in flaming ruins. In a dispute over residuals, Frida devoured her own agent. Both girls sexually assaulted General Kigore, leaving him a mentally-broken man. Frida lost her BetaMax capsule, and Diedre retreated to her fortress of immeasurable guilt. Both were unaware the surviving space fairy planned to launch a devastating attack on the entire human race.

Do you really think that AI computers are just around the corner? [whimsical music] - Yes, and congratulations on winning that Hooter's bikini contest. Can I give you a lift home? - Sure.

Hey, maybe we can get a job dusting off old statues. - [chuckles] "Wonder Woman" is a stupid movie. This is real. And we're in real big trouble! - What are you talking about? With this power, we have the world at our fingertips. Literally. - You do. We lost one of our BetaMax capsules. And I never want it back. Just take it and go! - What happened to my BFFL? - We destroyed a city together. I think it's time we separate and see other superheroes. [Frida gasps] - Til death to us parts. - We killed movie stars. - What's Battle Bay without Combat Girl? That's like the Green Lantern without Bruce Lee. Like Atreyu without Falkor, the luck dragon. Come on, Diedre. - Get that thing away from me! [Frida exclaims] - Come on. Diedre. Put up the glasses. - No. - Come on. No one ever recognizes Clark Kent.

Like, I'm gonna be the next Jennifer Lawrence. [Amber chuckles] I can't work with this. - With what? - I mean, this could be a very bad move for my career. - This is a children's show. It's for children. Look, I, I'm trying to make you both stars. You should be kissing my right now. - You know, I'm a serious artist too. I won an AVN Award for "Desperate House Whores." Hmm? [Jimmy moans] Do you think that Jennifer Lawrence could shove this and do dialogue? - Why the hell would she want to? And what kind of agent has a vibrator on their desk? - You know, I don't, I don't even know what this is or where it came from, but just look- - Okay. - Let me tell you something. You both are blowing a huge opportunity for fame here. Thought maybe you could be blowin' something else right now. - Yeah. I think this is gonna be a bad career move. - Uh, wait a minute! Don't you work at that coffee shop on La Brea? [chuckles] Career? Top off that coffee, bitch! That's your career. [laughs] - I have never been so insulted in my life. - Hey! You watch your the ta-tas, superstar! - Oh yeah? - Yeah! Do you want a piece of me, Fran? Oh, is it Frank? - I'm a black belt in karate, bitch. You don't wanna fuck with me. - You know what, like most actresses- [ominous music] - Gimme that! - You are blowing a big opportunity right now, but you'd rather have nothing. So get out! [capsule thuds] [air twinkling] - You're lucky I don't shove a boot up your ass! - Oh, you think you can take me? - Blindfolded. - Okay, well let me just take my shoes off then. - Why? - Because black belt experts never fight with their shoes on. - Oh, okay. Yeah. Let me give you time to take your shoes off. [Fran exclaims] [Amber laughing] [dramatic music] - Girls, I'm not really feeling the chemistry right now, so why don't I call you- - You know what!

What's the matter, you can't talk, Franny? [Fran murmuring] [Fran gasps] - Damn divas! - How do you like that, Fran? [laughs] [Fran murmuring] It's your Oscar clip, bitch. It's your Oscar clip. [laughs] [Fran murmuring] [Joel shouting] Ow! - Where is he? Where is that little creep? Get out of there! - Oh, you bitch! I'm not taking this, where is this little creep? - [scoffs] Gay for pay, my ass! [Amber gasps] - Oh boy! - What the fuck is that little piece of shit? [gasps] It's that scumbag agent. He shrunk. - Girls, I don't know what's really happening right now, but I think it's best if you both should leave. - I'm sorry I kicked you in the cha-cha. [upbeat music] - It's okay. It's not your fault. - Damn right. It's his fault. - Me? - I've been through this before. Creeps like him pitting us against each other. He's a little parasite. - You know, I'm not really gay for pay. I've been hot for you the second I saw you. In your fucking dreams, bro. - You wish! [sirens blaring] - Free screening.
