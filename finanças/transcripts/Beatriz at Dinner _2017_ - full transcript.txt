(music playing) (bleating) (bleating) (bleating continues) (bleating continues) Hey, what is it? Lola, no. Shh, shh. (speaking Spanish) - (dog whimpering) - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. (speaking Spanish) Shh, Lola. Lola. (speaking Spanish) (dog barking, growling) (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) Lola, why do you...? (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (door closes) (music playing) (engine sputtering) (engine starts) (Beatriz speaking Spanish) (woman speaking Spanish) Kim, look at you, you look great. I'm gonna set up, okay? It'll take two seconds. Take a deep breath. - Mm-hmm. - All the way down. Let it fill your stomach, and then expand into your lungs. Hold it. Hold it. Release. You almost get a little high, huh? Hi, Susana. I'm so late. I have to drive to Newport Beach. (both speaking Spanish) (engine sputtering) (engine starts) (music playing) Beatriz: I'm going to the Birkhofer's. Kathy Birkhofer is my client. - Guard: Your name? - Beatriz Luna. (gate buzzes) Thank you. Hi. Thank you so much for coming up during rush hour. - Was it awful? - Yeah. That's why I'm a little late. Sorry, the traffic was terrible. Oh, don't worry about it. I just have to be done by 6:00. I have to get my face on. That's right, you're having a party. How wonderful. Just a little dinner party. You know, a few people, but I'm so glad you could make it. Kathy: Tara's loving college. So many interesting people. It's very diverse. Gays and trans and people from all over. Her roommate is a Jewish girl from New York. She's just having a great experience. That's awesome. I need to call her. I miss Tara. I'm just so relieved because, you know, I mean all I knew was places in Ohio and I just couldn't imagine why she'd want to leave here and spend four years of her life in Ohio. How are you, Beatriz? I'm okay. What? Only okay? What's wrong? MY goat. My neighbor complained about my goat. This neighbor, he's crazy. He's always drinking and angry. He came to my house at 11:00 at night and he said that they were gonna come and take away my goats. Who were? The city, you know? 'Cause they think they're nuisance animals. It's not zoned for goats. On, right. They run to me when I come home. They're so happy to see me. But they bleat a lot. So I bring them in the house and I make them a little pen in my bedroom. But last Saturday, I let them out and Hercules, he likes to burrow near the house. But Jeronimo... Beatriz? Oh, no. What happened? (stammers) He killed my goat. What? Who, your neighbor? I came back from the walk and Jeronimo was dead in the garden. His neck was broken. Are you serious? And I could feel his pain. He was already dead, I could still feel his pain. I held him when he was a little baby. He was such a fun personality. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you right before your party. I will burn some sage. No, it's okay, Beatriz. Oh, poor thing. (music playing) (engine sputtering) (sputtering continues) (engine clicking) (speaking Spanish) What happened? My car is not working. Oh, no. Did you call AAA? No I called a friend. He knows how to fix cars. He's almost done with work and then he's gonna come and help me. He's fixed it before. From Altadena? He doesn't mind. He's my friend. Right, but how long do you think it'll take him to get here? He has to finish work and there might be traffic. Well, you can just stay for dinner. It's just a work thing is the only thing. - Ah, no. - Let me talk to Grant. No, I can just wait anywhere. No, no, no, no, no, no. It should be fine. I can even wait in the car if you want. Don't be silly. I have a book I can read. Let me talk to Grant, it should be fine. This looks amazing. Thank you. Kathy: She needs to be at the clinic in the morning. She doesn't want to leave the car here. Grant, I don'! have time for this. I've got to get ready. It's Doug Strutt. It's work, Kathy. So is it a big deal? Uh, yeah. I told her she could have dinner here. So what do you want me to do? Do you want me to have her eat in the TV room by herself? Yeah. Really? ' Why not? Because I'm not gonna do that. Because she's not a housekeeper or something, she's a friend of the family. She is? Grant, she did so much for Tara. She's had a horrible week. Kathy: Her neighbor strangled her goat. - Okay, fine. - So it's one extra person at dinner, so what? She's the sweetest. - I said fine. - I've got to get ready. Then fucking get ready. - Hi. - Hi. Kathy: Beatriz? Ah, it's all okay, Beatriz. We want you to stay. Are you okay with what you're wearing? How do you feel? Maybe I have a sweater or a blouse or maybe Tara has something. But you're fine however, I just... I'm just running so late. (music playing) - You have the champagne? - Yes. Should we leave the keys in case they want to move the car? I'll put them on the seat. It's safe, right? Babe, we've been through like three security gates. Oh, this gravel. - Hi, come in. - Hello. Welcome. Thank you. Kathy and Grant will be down any second. - This is for them. - Okay. It's for everyone, it's for all of us. Great, I'll make sure to get it to them. Can I offer either of you an aperitif? I'll have a vodka soda with a splash of cran. Okay, any preference on vodka? Stoli, Grey Goose, whatever you have. Uh, we have both. Grey Goose. Uh, Jack and Coke. - Jack and Coke, perfect. - (Shannon chuckles) - Alex: Dude. - Shannon: What? Alex: It's hitting me. Shannon: What? (whispering) We're gonna be fucking rich. Shut up. Yeah, we're gonna be fucking rich. - Really? - Yeah. I'm gonna be making more than you now. - How do you like that? - We'll see. Alex: Are you the plus one tonight or am I the plus one? Shannon: Okay, I'm the plus one. Alex: That? what I thought. So you must be very attracted to me right now. Kind of. - A little bit? - A little bit. Just don't leave me stuck with the wives all night, okay? - Uh-huh. - You promise? - Somebody's here. - Oh. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Beatriz. - Hi, I'm... Hi. - I'm Shannon. This is Alex. - Hi. - Hi. - (Alex chuckles) Shannon, Alex, okay. So, uh, you're at... where are you? You're at Veriden? - No. - No. Um, how... how do you know Kathy and Grant? I know them through Tara. I'm a health therapist. - I do massage, sound therapy. - Gotcha. - Reike, Tai Chi, nutrition... - I see. So, you're a nutritionist? Alex has kidney stones. Yeah, I mean, apparently just like crystals form in my urine, you know, which is apparently not that uncommon, right, babe? Oh, no, that's horrible. Yeah, the worst. Not fun. No, I thought he was dying. I mean, I didn't know what was happening. He fell to the ground. I called for the kids. I mean, I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I wanted them to maybe just say goodbye to their father. Yeah, they were traumatized. He was lying on the ground screaming. I was hysterical, the kids didn't know what the hell was going on. It was awful. Uh, Grey Goose, splash of cran. - Thank you. - And Jack and Coke. - Thank you. - Can I get you anything? - Just water. - You sure? Is there any wine? Of course, yeah, red or white? Maybe a little white wine. - Okay, a little bit of white. - Yes. You shouldn't be drinking if you have kidney stones. I know, I know, but tonight is... You can drink whatever you want tonight, okay, babe? I mean, Alex is the reason why we're celebrating. Alex got the legislator to approve the development. It all passed today. It wasn't just me. Took a lot of people. Um, takes a village, that's what they say. He's being modest. It was a huge deal. I mean, nobody thought it was gonna pass. I had to fellate every single state senator in California. - Oh, my God. - A lot of guys. You know what's great for kidney stones? Apple cider vinegar, beets, rhubarb, and dandelion root. Mm, dandelion root. Babe, your favorite. Yeah, I love it. Anything else? Anything edible? - It's a joke. - (both chuckle) Doug is here. Okay, great. - He's at the gate. - Wonderful. Alex and Shannon are downstairs. Terrific. It's 6:13, Kathy. Perfect. I'll be right down. (music playing) - Welcome. - Hey, hey. - Hello. - Hi, guys. - Hi. - Congratulations. Congratulations. - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you, too. - You look fantastic. - Oh, so do you. - Hey, Shannon. - Hi, Grant. Welcome. How are you? - Remember Shannon? - Hi. Hi, how are you? - Hi, I'm Alex. - Alex. Jeana. I'm Shannon. - Love your tunic. - Thank you. - It's Jonny Balaine. - Oh, I thought so. Nice work, Alex. Hail the conquering hero. Only took a year and a half. Faster than some, right? Faster than most, are you kidding? I knew her back when she had that little shop in Balboa. Oh, my God, I was her roommate. We lived together for just like a month. (indistinct chatter) Listen, I told Cal about tonight, but he's got this deposition tomorrow morning. - Stupid lawsuit. - I'm such a klutz on heels. I almost just broke my ankle out there. Oh, don't sue. - (laughs) - I won't. Let's get you a drink. (indistinct chatter) - Hi, guys. - (ladies laugh) - Not even that exceptional. - It's great. Oh, I love succulents. - Those are my favorite. - Oh, I know. I do, too. - Thank you. - Thank you, Evan. Thank you. - He's also a very talented... - Thank you. ...um, what do you call it? (gasps) Beatriz, oh, my God. I'm so rude. Shannon, Jeana, this is my dear friend Beatriz. - Oh. - We met inside. Oh, good. - Nice to meet you. - Oh! You're so beautiful. - Thank you. - You all are. Beatriz is a healer. I am not even joking. She is a miracle worker. We met at the Ardendale Center. Do you guys know to the Ardendale Center? - Uh-uh. - It's a cancer... well, it's everything, but mostly cancer. It's very food centered. A lot of alternative therapies. It's near Santa Monica. We went up there when Tara was diagnosed with Hodgkin's. - Oh, my God. - Cancer? - Yeah. - I had no idea. She had it in her thymus, she had it in her spleen. It was in the lining above her diaphragm. It was really scary. - Sure. - Of course. And she was 15. So I had to educate myself completely... every doctor, every drug. And Grant is very left brain. He's very by-the-book Western, so of course we did the whole surgery-chemo-radiation and Tara ended up NED. She's fine, thank God. But after the chemo, she had no strength. She wasn't eating and I'd heard about Ardendale. So we went down there and she just took to it. She loved the food. She loved the therapies. And we met Beatriz. And Beatriz and Tara just hit it off. - I love Tara. - So then I started using her. And Grant, too. Mostly just for massages. We're linked, you know? I think spiritually linked. The first time I met her, it was like I recognized her just by the eyes. Recognized her as what? Maybe my mother in another life or my daughter. You have unfinished business with someone and then in the next life, they come back in a different form. I love psychic stuff. Oh, I let this gypsy steal $2,000 from me once. It was so humiliating. Tara is an old soul. She cares so much about animals and nature. The earth needs old souls because, you know, it is very sick. And the old souls must help us find a way to heal the Earth. - That's a big responsibility. - Yeah. Have you guys seen the pictures of Zoey Mars? - Yes. - What is that about? Doug and I were looking at them in the car on the way over here. We almost threw up. Where is that girl's mother is what I want to know. What? What happened? Oh, it's this reality star, she's a... - She has a clothing line. - ...tween singer. And her phone got hacked, so there's these pictures all over the Internet that she apparently sent her gynecologist of her vagina. - Oh. - Poor girl. - She has herpes, yeah. - Kathy: It's awful. So she has all these crusty red inflamed sores all over her vagina. How do they know it's her vagina? 'Cause you can see her face in the photos. Shannon: How can you be so stupid? Kathy: It's really sad, actually. I mean, she was hacked. Well, her career's over. I mean, if you see the pictures. You wanna see the pictures? Shannon: I still have to eat. No. No, no, I- no, no. (women laughing) Shannon: Oh, my God. In a way, it's kind of amazing. Uh-huh. (Shannon laughs) (indistinct chatter) Kathy: Grant, honey, I'm gonna give the girls a little tour. Grant: Sounds good. (indistinct chatter) (indistinct chatter) - (laughing) - Jesus, Doug. That one goes in the memoirs. It's going in the memoirs. - I'm writing a memoir. - Bullshit, really? Yeah, we got a deal with Random House. Just gotta get around to writing it. But I'm always coming up with titles. - You want to hear some? - Hell, yeah. - Of course, hit me. - Doug: Yeah. "Life Is A Game And Guess Who Won." Big picture of me on the cover. - I love it. - Alex: Done. That? it. And this is good. "You're In My Way, Asshole... A Memoir by Doug Strutt." (men laughing) "How To Make A Billion Dollars Without Going To Prison Except For One Time And I Was Innocent And Besides, Everyone Else Was Doing It." (men laughing) - That's hilarious. - That's a best seller. Here is the best title for a memoir. "This Can't Possibly End Well." - (men laughing) - Alex: Oh, my God. Guys, um, before dinner, I just wanted to give you a little heads up. Can I get another bourbon, hon? Oh, no, no, Doug. This is... uh, this is Beatriz. I'm sorry you weren't introduced. She's our guest. She's staying for dinner. Oh. Okay. You were hovering. I just figured you were part of the staff. - I'll go and get you a drink. - Oh, thanks. - Alex? - Uh, Jack and Coke. Can I have another? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, wine? So, where are you from? Altadena. Ah. Where are you really from? I was born in Tlaltecuhtli, Mexico. Tlalte... - Tlaltecuhtli. - Tlaltecuhtli. On the Pacific. It was very beautiful once. Mexico is awesome. I love Cancun. But now many hotels, timeshares. A lot of crime, I think. And where are you from? Laguna. But we have houses in... well, we're all over. But where are you really from? I was born in Oaxaca. (Doug laughs) No, no, I was born in San Diego. (men laughing) Now I've got the giggles. Do I know you? Oh, Doug's famous. He's been on the news. You know, he's a mogul. I have opinions and because I have money, people listen. I don't know why, but I think I know you. Well, maybe. Ever dance in Vegas? (laughs) (phone chimes) Excuse me. (speaks Spanish) And this is Tara's room. Oh, pretty. (gasps) - Lucky girl. - Yeah. (women laugh) Aw, that was her last summer. - Jeana: Oh. - Shannon: Aw. - Beautiful eyes. - All grown up. Yeah. And this is her while she was in treatment. She had to have so many rounds of chemo. It was awful. It almost killed her. - Seriously? - Yeah. And that's Beatriz? Yes. During her recovery, Beatriz was so helpful. I'm telling you, this woman is a saint. It's like birds fly out of the sky and land on her shoulder. Aw, it's like Snow White. We had a baby nurse like that. When she left, Alex and I sobbed. - Really? - Now we're gonna have to get up in the middle of the night and hold the baby. Kidding. We loved her. She was like a member of the family. Well, Beatriz's family had to leave their home when she was a little girl in Mexico and they were so poor that they all had to separate from each other. So she never really knew her mother and then she was raised by her grandmother and then her grandmother died and she was all alone. And then she married a guy here and he disappeared... - God. - ...or got killed. Kathy. I'm so sorry, but my friend that was gonna fix my VW cannot come until tomorrow morning. I don't know what to do. Stay here. I feel bad. What? Don't you feel bad. Don't you ever feel bad. You can stay right here in Tara's room. - Are you sure? - I insist. Thank you, Kathy. The only thing I ask is that you take one of Tara's guitars and you sing us a song after dinner. Beatriz has the most incredible singing voice. I need to call my friend to stop at my house and check on my dogs and my goat. Oh, yeah. Do that. Thank you, Kathy. Stop thanking me. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Oh. So sweet. Did she say goat? When you're ready, we'd like to invite you in for dinner. Oh, great. I'm glad this worked out. Doug, I know you have a busy schedule and it's so great that you were in town when the good news came in and we were all able to gather- Let me just say... - or, did I cut you off? - No, no, go ahead. I don't wanna cut off the host. All yours. Well, first, I want to say on behalf of Jeana and myself, thank you for having us at your stunning home. And of course, to you, Kathy, for helping make this dinner. You did help make the dinner? - God. Doug. - Kathy: Well, I didn't. But I did plan the menu. And I know that sounds easy, but when you have OCD like I do, you know it took me about three weeks. And uncatered food is the best food. Kathy, in all seriousness, you are the consummate host. You are a knockout. And if I wasn't on my third wife, I'd steal you away. Oh, thank you. I would personally love a sister wife. Trust me. And I couldn't be more pleased and frankly, surprised at how smoothly this whole process has gone. Thanks in large part to Alex's efforts. - Alex. - (clapping) And, Alex, if any of those efforts were illegal, I do not know you nor was I even here tonight. Neither was I. And it's my house. I hope that this is the beginning of along partnership between Veriden and Rife. And I think that we are all gonna make a lot of fucking money. (all laugh) Kathy: Cheers. Tonight you have a choice of two entrees. - The chef has prepared... - I would just like to say to Kathy and Grant, thank you for having me tonight. I know you were not expecting me, but I love Tara. I love your family. And I love being in your house. And it's an honor to meet all of you. Aw, so sweet, thank you. And I would like to give you all treatments, free, of course, as my way of saying thank you for including me tonight. Oh, no, Beatriz, you don't have to do that. A treatment? What do you mean? She's a masseuse, Doug. She gives massages. We're getting free massages? - All of us at the same time? - Oh. - You wish, you sicko. - (all laughing) You would have to come to the center in Santa Monica. - I have an office. - You have an office? - Good for you. - We have many treatments. Rolfing, breath therapy... I'm so sorry to interrupt. I need to take everyone's order. You have a choice of either the grilled halibut or the beef tenderloin. Well, I'll have the beef. I'll have the beef too, please. - Halibut please. - Beef. Uh, fish for me. I'll have the halibut. And Beatriz is a vegetarian, so if we could just put some vegetables and rice and salad on her plate, that'd be great, thank you. Thank you, Kathy. That's perfect. Rolfing, huh? You go to school for that? Well, when I first came to the United States - a long time ago... - Did you come legally? - Yes. - Now, how'd that work? I had family here on my mother? side. When my grandmother died- Doug: They're all citizens or- - You're grilling her. - Doug: I'm curious. A lot of people come here illegally. I was interested how she did it. Jeana: Okay. Just ignore him. So you came here however, who cares, and then? I found a job at a health food market. I didn't speak any English, so my job was just to clean and lay out the fresh food. But there was a pharmacist there, Dr. Shibari. And he taught me everything about alternative medicine. All the therapies. He was like a father to me. The father I wish I had. So great to have a mentor. Beatriz: Dr. Shibari was a wonderful man. Very wise. He saved my life, I think, because I always had inside me the desire to be a healer... Good for you. You're working. You're contributing. Must be very fulfilling. Uh, I just wanted to mention, uh... From the time I was very little, I have these feelings. I remember! was maybe six years old. My father was a fisherman and he took me to the sea to fish. We were on this little pier, you know, and, he pulled up an octopus. A big, beautiful, white, very white octopus. I had never seen anything like that. And my father starts kicking the octopus. He kicked it down that pier like if it was a football. He was stomping on it like a crazy man. And then he starts kicking it towards me. Then he said to me, "Beatriz, kill it." I look down at the octopus and I touched it. And this shock went through my whole body. I could feel the pain of this octopus. - It was electric. - You're very sensitive. Maybe it was an electric eel. When I'm on a table, she can sense exactly where I'm storing my stress. It's usually in my... Have you ever seen a white octopus? Yes, terrifying. He forced me to go scuba diving. I was fucking out of there. I had a panic attack. - Kathy:...fuses to the bone. - Really? That sucks. Kathy: Yeah, I know. - This looks great. - Oh, my God, I'm so excited. For those of you with the beef, it's a tenderloin with a garlic horseradish cream. And the fish is a grilled Alaskan halibut with a lemon-dill vinaigrette. - Mm. - Kathy: Thank you, Evan. - So tasty. - Alex: So just a heads up, um, got word at the end of the day that the NR DC's gonna be filing a suit against the bill. Of course they are. Fuck them. That's why we need to break ground immediately. Just get going Monday morning. Grant: We're on it, Doug. We're on the same page. Doug: Because until a judge issues an injunction, it is completely within our rights - to start clearing the land. - For sure. It's just they found some nests of a few protected birds. - Move them. - Grant: That? what we'll have to do. Alex: Exactly. And obviously there's still a lot of permitting because the county and the state are dragging ass. The permitting is for the construction, okay? - We can still clear the land. - Right, yes, true. And if we wait to clear it, there could be hiccups. I've been down this road before. Once you've cleared the land, there's nothing left to protect. There's nothing to protest. There's nothing to fight about. Grant: Hundred percent. I agree. Jackie in my office also did mention there's talk online of a few activists, super marginal players, who, you know, may be handcuffing themselves to the fences outside the work site. - I've had worse. - Grant: So have we. Once, we built a hotel in Panama and some locals blew up one of our trucks with a fucking bomb. So, you know, bring it on. (Doug chuckles) The most important thing is to start. We start. And once we start, we have the momentum. This is why I love working with you. No canvassing. Usually there are so many meetings and hand-wringing. Doug: Benefit of a privately owned company, pal. It's the history of progress. - One man's will. - What is this man's name? - It's me and my will. - Doug what? - Strutt. - How do you spell it? Hm? Shannon could really use you on one of her projects. That's right. I'm project director on a refinery we're building in France. - I mean talk about bureaucracy. - Excuse me. France is like a third world country. You can't get anything done there. I hate France. Hate the French. (laughs) (indistinct chatter) (speaking Spanish) Bye. The wife, mother-in-law, two aunts, one of them lived even though the bullet went in her skull and came out her jaw. It was just three blocks from our house. Yeah, we used to see them at Starbucks. - I mean, what is going on? - People are fucking nuts. People are insane. So, Doug, you build hotels? I don't build them, no. He builds things. I just own them. You own hotels? Have you ever, owned any in Mexico? Yeah, a few. Did you have one in Tlaltecuhtli? Tlalte... pla... what? Tlaltecuhtli. (stutters) Tlaltecuhtli. - Tlaltecuhtli. - I don't know. I don't even know where that is. In Guerrero, north of Acapulco. I partner on a hotel in Cancun and one in San Miguel. This was a resort with a golf course. It closed. It was only open for a year. Mine don't close. Mostly. (sighs) This tenderloin was amazing. So was the fish. So buttery. Flaky. I'm so glad. This hotel destroyed my whole town. The Mexican government told the people that they were gonna have many jobs at the hotel, that there would be work. They were very excited at first but then they took their land illegally. All these people had to leave their homes with nothing and nowhere to go. My family, too. - Oh, no. - There were protests. A lot of people were killed by the Mexican police. Assassinated. It's a fact. Shit. Jesus. They dug up all the canals, cut away the mangrove trees. It was an American hotel. I can't remember the name. Hyatt? Hilton? Sheridan? It was 40 years ago. - Four Seasons? - I'm old, sweetheart. I'm not that old. When I first saw you, I thought I knew you from somewhere. And then you started speaking about people protesting your hotel. It's not a hotel. It's a shopping center. And no one's getting kicked out of their homes except maybe a few birds. (chuckles) Honey, why don't we eat our dessert in the living room? Yes. Great. Let's all stretch our legs. Doug, I'm sorry if I... just know that I'm happy for your project. - Thanks, hon. - No, really. You're warm. Oh! Wow. Hey, this is my lucky day. Oh, your neck, there's a lot of tension in your neck. She's a miracle worker, Doug. (Doug exhales) (music playing) Oh. Oh, that was great. Chocolate and raspberry, the absolute best. - Jeana: It's so creamy. - Shannon: Isn't it? Kathy: Beatriz, I think we have some sorbet. Can you check to see if we have some sorbet for Beatriz? I think we have a pineapple or a mango. Absolutely. How are your sons, Doug? Oh, they're great. Jack has his fun. He's just raking it in, hand over fist. He's gonna be richer than all of us. I got to say, I get almostjealous when I see how easy it is for these guys from banking to just pull these pots of gold out of thin air. I know. It's sick, right? For me, way more satisfying, what I do. Yeah, it's not always easy. Every step is a slog. - The struggle is real. - But you're building something. It's not all transactional. You're changing the dynamics of things, real things. You get a vision of a place in your head and then, poof, it exists. - You're writing history. - Totally agree. Doug: And Calvin's working with me at Rife. And he's a natural. We got exactly the same instincts. That's so neat, Doug. And when I hang it up, whenever that day comes, I have no doubt that he will carry on the dynasty. Grant: I don'! see you handing over the reins any time soon. Out of my cold, dead hands, right? (all laughing) And they both have families and grandkids. Everyone gets along with Jeana. I mean, mostly. - Uh-oh. - No, we do. The big issue is where we're gonna spend the holidays. Jack and Britney are in Connecticut and they have their house in St. Barth's. And Calvin's here, and he has his place in Cabo, and we 're here and we have this place we love on the Big Island. - War of the beach houses. - I love the Big Island. - Yeah, we always lose. - Jack's wife is not easy. We try to go away every summer. It's just so hot now everywhere. And crowded. Ugh. I mean, the best weather is right here. That's what I keep saying to Kathy. Why leave? Actually, we're going to South Africa in a couple of days. It's gonna be 115 degrees. - Oh, what's happening there? - Grant: South Africa? For a safari. - Oh, amazing. - Oh, cool. - I wanna go. - You should come. No, seriously, come. I'm gonna be by myself all day stuck at the lodge with little kids and Britney. - Unfortunately, I work. - Where's Doug gonna be? Oh, he'll be gone all day with Jack and Kelvin hunting. Alex: Hunting? Shit. Yeah. It's Africa, right? - Grant: What are you hunting? - Jeana: Oh, don? go into it. - You brought it up. - Jeana: Okay. Well, it's true, though, what they say. Those animals would basically be gone if it wasn't for the hunting because it's very important to the economy. It keeps the parks going. I have had, all the rushes there are, every one. I've been to the buffet of life. I've tasted everything and I'm telling you, being in Africa, okay... where all the species originated, every one, including us, going out into the wild when it's still dark and it's quiet, except for these strange, prehistoric sounds, and waiting... for some beast to emerge out of the bush. There's no bigger rush. (chuckles) I bet. There's no better high, not... not sex, not drugs, not money. And facing that creature down and looking in its eyes and taking it. I don't consider it murder. I don't. It is a killing, obviously, but it's just this deep, primal thing. It's like this original dance of man and beast, man and nature. The struggle for survival. It's very pure. Not to get too airy-fairy. (all laugh) Yeah. I just can't imagine doing it myself. - What kind of beast? - Huh? What are you hunting this time? Let's just say big game. - Grant: Well, come on, tell us. - No. Let's not get into it. Some people can't handle it. Let me just show you a picture from our last trip. - Jeana: Oh, God. - Doug: Hang on. Where is it here? Here. There you go. Wow. You shot that? Holy fuck. That thing is massive. Doug: Yeah. Maybe 10 yards from me, too. Grant: Don't look at that, Kathy. I'm not going to. Oh, my God. Cost me a fortune for that one. Almost didn't get it either. Yeah. We knew it was out there, but it took us about 10 hours to find it. Hunting is all about patience. We had to stalk it for, like, all day. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, we came on it. Jack spotted it in a clearing. Now those rhinos can run. Trust me. They can move pretty good and they're dangerous. Not as dangerous as hippos. We got one of them, too. Evan: We did find some sorbet. Mix here of pineapple, passion fruit and guava. Are you for real? This is disgusting. - You killed this animal? - Hey! - Hey, what? - What is wrong with you? Beatriz, calm down. You think it's funny? I don't think it's funny. I think it's fucking sick. I told you. - Most people can't handle it. - Doug, I'm... - I'm so sorry, man. - I am so sorry. She's had a really hard week. - I don't know what to say. - It's fine. Not everyone is like me. And thank God, right? I'm just glad she didn't break my phone. Kathy: Is it broken? It does have a little crack, actually. Oh, well we will replace that, Doug, please. - Grant: Absolutely. - It's fine. Does she get out much? (all laugh) Where is she? Should I offer coffee? No. Not yet. Let them keep drinking. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Kathy. - Yeah. I don't... - I saw it and I don't know. - I just flipped out. - I get it. I just... You were so nice to let me stay. I never drink like this. I think I had three glasses. I've just been very emotional. I think you're just burned out. That's what it is. You're burned out. It's hard what you do. One of my patients, he's only 16. He's gonna die, Kathy, and there's nothing I can do. It's horrible. And then Jeronimo. I know. Aw. I'm so embarrassed. Do you think I should go say something? I think maybe, honestly, you should just go to bed. Just go to Tara's room, okay? It's fine. It didn't bother him. He's a tough guy. That beautiful rhinoceros, Kathy. - Why? - Don't think about it. I'm so sorry. I've ruined your party. I will take you and Grant for dinner. I'll cook. - No. - Free treatments. - Don't worry about it. - Please, just let me give you free treatments for the rest of your life. I do have to get back to the group though. - Yes, of course. - Go up to Tara's room. Go to bed. I'll see you in the morning. - Thank you for everything. - Okay. I never should drink like that. - I love you, Kathy. - Aw. Good night. (music playing) (speaking Spanish) (laughter) (indistinct chatter) (men laughing) (indistinct chatter) Kathy: But I think what you're saying is true, Doug. You don't really know people when they work for you. - You don't. - Jeana: Well, of course. I mean, everybody kisses your ass. Everyone's nice to the boss. I actually think you only know people when they do work for you. That's when you see their ego, needs, insecurities, authority issues. Yes, preach, totally. Doug: It? a... Buenas noches. I thought you went to bed. I remember Kathy asked me to sing a song after dinner. Oh, yeah, but that's not necessary now, Beatriz. I feel I should. Well, we're just enjoying the stars and the sounds of the night, so... I feel bad about what happened earlier. I lost my manners. I'm sorry. It happens. Don't tear your hair out. Doug loses his manners all the time. Don't give it two thoughts. Every time I go out with him he embarrasses me. Oh, you're well compensated. See? He's rude. He can't help it. Do you know "Las Simples Cosas"? This song talks about how we always wanna go back to the places where we loved life. But the old, simple things are now gone. (singing in Spanish) (clapping) That was very nice. - Very nice. - Oh, that was lovely. - Muchas gracias - De nada. Aye, Chihuahua. Okay, you're... you're done. Sorry. - Thank you very much. - Oh, it is so nice out here. Kathy: Oh, we feel so lucky. Except we bought at the height of the market. Other than that, we feel lucky. Well, you can't take it with you. More wine? Oh, yes, please. Doug, you really are famous. I was just searching you on the Internet, and you're famous. Nah, famous? I don't know. I'm known. You gave a great TED talk, Doug. We watched that the other night. For a moment, I thought you were a different man. A man that bought the land in Tlatecuhtli. For a minute, I freaked out, you know? Really, because I have to say, if you had been that man... I would've thought that fate brought us together. For what? I don't know. Revenge, maybe? I should kill you or something? (chuckles) But you're not that man. You're another man. Many men do what I do. One man, many men. So you believe in fate, huh? - Yes. - So do I. I think we all have a destiny to manifest. And if we don't, it hurts the soul. If the brass ring is there, there's a reason. And if we don't grab it, we... we regret it for the rest of our lives. - I think that's right. - Alex: Word. I always felt that my fate was to heal people. And that's what I've tried to do. But there's so many sick people. Every day more come. They have cancer, they are dying. It's like a war and I'm just a nurse in the middle of a battlefield. It's too much. I'm tired. But hasn't cancer gotten more treatable? It has. Just look at Tara. A good time to have cancer. Doug, you think killing is hard, huh? You wait in the bushes, the animal might outrun you or charge you. It's not easy to get your shot, hm? Try healing something. That is hard. That requires patience. You can break something in two seconds. But it can take forever to fix it. A lifetime, generations. That's why we have to be careful on this earth and gentle. Seems like you have a pretty tough job. Yes, and there are moments where I think... instead of trying to heal all these people... it'd be better just to find the source of all the suffering. Destroy the source, you know? What's the source? What, you think I'm the source? She doesn't think that. I think she does. You give me too much credit. What I think is all your pleasures are built on other's pain. - Ah, that's bullshit. - No. Doug: Look, I'm a big boy, okay? Listen, honey. I think you have a great depth of feeling that you project onto the world. But to be honest, the world doesn't need your feelings. It needs jobs, it needs money, it needs what I do. The world doesn't need you. No. The world has more than enough of you. Doug is a great philanthropist. Shut up, Kathy. There is another type of cancer that is killing this earth, Doug. The world is dying. You do see that. Or are you blind? Jeana: The problem is there's just too many people. That's the problem, there's just way too many people. You think that you can hide up here behind these gates and that everything is gonna be all right? No, it's coming for you. What the fuck is going on here? - Okay, that's enough. - Mm-hm. It will touch you. You're done. Come on. (laughs) I don't think she's a fan, Doug. I hope it will touch me in my private parts. (laughing) What the fuck was that? Huh? My relationship with that guy paid for this house. What were you thinking? Why would you do that to Kathy? She treats you like her fucking friend. I'm calling a tow truck. They will tow you back to Altadena. You're going tonight. Jesus. Don't ruin it by being a weird drunk, okay? Stop it. I mean, it's not like we're beheading people or blowing up babies. It's so awkward. Grant: Well, that was different. I'm sorry about that, everyone. - What happened? - She's going home - don't worry about it. - But how? I took care of it, okay? Okay- (speaking Spanish) Bien, muchas gracias. (music playing) Beatriz? You're leaving? Yes. I think it's best. I wanted to give you some money. Just take it. It's gonna be so expensive for you to get your car towed back to Altadena. I don't want your money. Well, I don't know. I kind of feel like I don't even know you. You don't know me. Well, I'm sorry this happened. I'm gonna go back. Alex: Well, where's the candle? Grant: Well, it's right here. - That whole thing's a candle? - Yeah. Now just let it get a little hot. I think you got to light up first. Oh, my God, Grant. You know he's a pyromaniac. Every time I turn around, he's lighting something on fire. - You wanna flip it? - Yeah, let's flip it over. Okay. Here we go. Okay. There we go. This is Cal. He's got that deposition. I'm gonna take this in the house. Okay- - What, we just hold it? - Grant: Yeah. Jeana, would you like to let it go? Oh, okay. Will you hold that? Now, make a wish because it's a wishing lantern. Okay. If I set everything on fire, will it still come true? Oh, I know. Should we be doing this? Yeah, technically it's not a firework. Well, if you burn down the canyon, you're still going to jail. Alex is a lawyer. He'll get you off. Well, we would have had so much fun. I got you, man. You're good. - Okay. - All right. Let go. - Jeana: Whee! - Grant: Oh. - Alex: Oh. - Grant: See that? (all laugh) That is beautiful. Kathy: Isn't it amazing? Grant: Look at that. Doug: I think you should have given all your emails to her. Yeah, all- all your correspondence. Yes. Because she's most likely gonna enter them all as evidence anyway and he needs to know what he's up against. He's your lawyer. He's working for you. You should have done this eight months ago. okay- Okay, talk to him and then just call me back. I'm... still at this dinner, so make it fast. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. No "good nights"? (chuckles) How many years till we're both dead? Twenty years, thirty years? We're dying. Humans are dying. The elephants are dying. Bees are dying. The world is dying. What are you gonna do? Accept it and enjoy yourself. You should try to enjoy yourself. It's not all so sad, is it? I know I know you. (car approaching) (door closes) Tow truck driver: You have everything? You ready? (door closes) (door opens) (door shuts) Wait. I forgot one thing. (door closes) Let's do it in the morning. I got to get home. I'm tired and I got... (groans) Gad! Fuck! (grunting) (gasping) (grunts) All tears flow from the same source. What happened? Doug? Doug? Doug! - Oh, my God, Doug? - Oh, my God! - Grant! - Grant: Yeah? (Jeana crying) Oh. my God! - Beatriz, what happened? - Jeana: What did you do? (Jeana crying) Kathy: Why? Why? Beatriz, what happened? (voices fade) Doug: No, let's do it in the morning. I'm tired and I've got other shit going on. (metal clanks) (music playing) Driver: You okay? That man killed my goat. Pull over. What? Pull over, please, right there. Driver: Where are you going? Lady? Can someone help me hold this? Let them go at the same time and make a wish. Everybody on three. One... - Alex? - What? We're supposed to let them go at the same time. Alex: Sorry. (Alex laughs) (music playing) (waves crashing) (laughing) (music continues) (music continues) (music playing)
