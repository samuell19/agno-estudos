[church bells] [soprano singing in latin] [man speaking latin] [bell rings] [muttering in latin] [radio crackle] VOICE ON RADIO: This is London. This morning the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that, unless we heard from them by 11:00 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany. [man muttering in latin] [distant siren wail] Father, that noise, it's a siren! Would you kindly kneel down? I don't hear anything. No, father, it's a siren! I can hear it! They're going to bomb us! [siren wails again] Sisters, get the girls under the pews, away from the windows. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, we pray for us sinners. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, we pray for us sinners. [father continues praying] [nuns begin muttering prayers] [prayers continue] FATHER LARKIN: Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death. Amen. [siren wails] Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed are-- Quiet! You can all come out now. [siren slowly dies away] Sisters, girls, we shall now receive God's comfort-- and you, too, girl-- in the sacrament of holy communion. [panicked breathing] Nothing is wrong with you, Maggie. Dr. Taylor, I can't breathe! [strained breathing] What do you feel? Breath. Mm-hm. I'm all right then? Yes, of course you're all right. You're just a bit nervous, that's all. Sit down. [CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE FOR BREATH] Drink it down. [maggie gags] I just knew the war would come. We're all going to die. Yes. Well, if we're all going to die, you might as well go with a smile on your face, hm? Another? [maggie coughs] SISTER THOMAS: Dr. Taylor told me of your nervousness. She's Saint Dymphna, the patron saint of nervous complaints and mental disorders. She's absolutely beautiful. She isn't a saint because of her beauty. Yes Sister Thomas. She was a martyr for her faith. I shall make a special novena to Saint Dymphna for you. Thank you sister. But you must help with your own prayers. Every day, morning and evening. And always call upon her when you need her. Yes Sister. But then, do why you are nervous? I'm afraid to die. But death is something we should all look forward to. It means we can finally be united with God. It's really unnatural to fear death. Unless, of course, your soul is stained with sin. Oh, no, Sister. I went to confession yesterday and I haven't sinned since. Not even a venial sin? MAGGIE: No, Sister. Even considering your behavior today in front of the Eucharist? If you were to die with one venial sin on your soul, it would take 1,000 years in purgatory to make up for it. That's how long it takes God to get over the pain caused by your one venial sin. That's how much we hurt God when we sin. You know, McLean, if you really understood how much God loved you, you'd never sin again. And you never, ever fear anything again. Yes, Sister. Good Good evening, Ms. Blundel. Sister. How do you do, Ms. Blundel? Good evening, Sister Perpetua. Sisters, I'm terribly sorry, but I must dash off to place six more girls before midnight. Oh, we understand, Ms. Blundel. Everything's ready for the evacuees. Splendid. (WHISPERING) One more thing. The girls are all in the family way, but they're not very far along and we'll find other arrangements for them as soon as possible. Why weren't we informed of this beforehand? We didn't know. And then when we found out we had a bit of difficulty in placing them. But one nice thing, the girls are all Roman Catholics and, I might add, very devout. They're really lovely girls. I know you'll get on very well. I must dash. Thank you so very much. We will be in touch. Goodbye. Mother, I must tell you, all those girls are in the family way. Really? What are we going to do with them? Didn't you set up beds near the older girls' dormitory? Well, yes, but I don't think that's a good idea. Our girls will ask questions and they're bound to start talking. I don't know where else we can put them. Name? Doris Miller. Age? 15. And how far along are you? I'm not in that condition, Sister. I wanted to be here because I'm Catholic. Are you telling the truth? Yes. Well, we'll put you in with the normal girls. Sister Thomas! GIRLS IN UNISON: Good evening, Sister Thomas. Good evening, girls. Girls, this is Doris Miller. Corrigan, would you show Miller her place and explain all the rules to her? Yes, Sister Thomas. This is your bed. Most places I've been there's just one bath in each room. Well, we're lucky we get two. If all the girls on our floor had to use the same bath, the water would get awfully mucky. Didn't she carry on something awful? Doesn't she always? Well, they might bomb, you know? No, I don't know. I bet they do. You haven't got any money to bet. Now, that one in there-- she's got money. She can make a few bets. How can you tell? Didn't you see her clothes? Bet they cost a few bob. - Highgate? - Yes. It's-- it's in London. Sounds lovely. Well, I hope it's still there when I get back. That's it, girls. Knees down, legs together. We don't want to make room for the devil, do we? GIRLS IN UNISON: No, Sister Thomas. This present war is a mortal's war. And if we should lose, it won't be the end of the world because we can always pick ourselves up and start again. But there's one war that we can't afford to lose, and that is the war with Satan. If we give in to Satan's temptations and die in the stage of sin, we'll spend eternity with him in hell without hope of ever getting out. Is it worth it, girls? GIRLS IN UNISON: No, Sister Thomas. [siren wails] [gasps] Wake up! Air raid! Wake up! Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death. Amen. [muttered prayers continue] Blessed are thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. [prayers continue] Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death. Amen. [siren wails] That siren, girls, is the all-clear. Now, you will remain seated until it's finished, and quietly give thanks to God for protecting you. McLean, do you have faith in God? Yes, Sister Thomas. I do. Then I suggest you prove it by praying to Saint Dymphna for the remainder of the night. Yes, Sister Thomas. [gunshot] [clapping] Get up, girls. We have no time to be idle. The devil loves idle minds. Move, Harris, you'll be late for mass. It's wet again, Buxton. Yes, Sister Thomas. God gives us time for everything. We have a time to use the toilet, and a time to sleep. We mustn't mix the two. You'll walk the grounds until I call for you. Yes, Sister Thomas. Lizzy, what's the matter with you? Get it off her. Well, what do you get when she leaves? You're not much of a head girl, are you? Mirrors aren't allowed in here, you know? Oh, no, sorry. I didn't. Well, you'll have to give it to me. Oh no, please let me keep it. I'll put it in my bag. Right. I have to tell Sister Thomas then. Wait. And, uh, don't let me catch you looking at yourself in the pond. Hold on, we'll have a look first. You might break it. [girls giggle] - Ugh. - Can I have a look? No. Go away. Look at her. [girls giggle] Yeah, look at her. [muttering in latin] Close your eyes and stick out your tongue. Amen. Girls, Warden Rodgers would like to have a word with you. This no joking matter, girls. War is not something we laugh about. Girls, please. Warden Rodgers is here to help us. When the enemy comes marching through your front door, you will all have something to laugh about then, won't you, hey? Now then, I checked your blackout work and it'll do. First off, we better get all the beds moved into the main corridor. The corridor? Right. When the bombs start falling, it will protect you from the flying glass. Excuse me, Warden, but we're in a safe area. We have evacuees. As far as I'm concerned, they're are no safe areas. The enemy has an Air Force that could wipe us all off the face of the earth. Now then, let's talk about bombs. Our biggest worry at the moment is the gas bomb. If a gas bomb should drop I shall sound this rattle. [loud rattling] And that means get your gas masks on quick because there won't be much time before the gas takes effect. And it's very nasty, indeed. When the danger has passed, I shall blow this whistle. [whistling] Now, if you should find any unexploded bombs lying about after a raid, tell me immediately. And, of course, never, ever touch any bomb you might find 'cause it's sure to explode. [MUSIC - FRANCES LANGFORD, "I'M IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE"] [music switches off] Who gave you the authority to let the girls listen to music? I'm sorry, Sister. No one did. Warden Rodgers gave the girls such a fright, I thought the music might soothe them a bit. Well, this is hardly the type of music to soothe young girls with. Yes, Sister. And the next time that you decide to do something good for the girls, would you kindly ask permission? Yes, Sister. Sister Thomas told me those are [inaudible] civil defense drills. So never mind what that warden says. We're all safe and sound. Safe and sound? Hitler has literally walked into Poland and occupied it. There's no reason why he shouldn't do exactly the same to us. What's a matter, Maggie? You're a right panic-monger, you are. You're as bad as that fat air raid warden. I was just being realistic. GIRL: See what you've done? GIRL: Go back to bed, Maggie, I promise you they won't bomb. I'm sorry if I frightened you. GIRL: "If" you frightened her? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to die. I know it. Don't be silly. Nothing's going to happen. Maggie, go back to bed. Pray to Saint Dymphna. You'll feel much better, I promise you. Go back to bed! Come here, Maggie. [rooster crows distantly] Maggie was upset and I called her over to my bed to cuddle her. We don't cuddle at this school. Or share beds. Is that understood, Miller? Oh yes, Sister Thomas. In fact, there's to be no touching at all. No holding hands or linking arms or words of endearment. We do this for your own good. Touching in any way, shape, or form gives rise to temptation, and the devil lies waiting for such things to take place. Do you wish to stay here, Miller? (EMPHATICALLY) Oh yes, Sister Thomas. SISTER THOMAS: "Yes, Sister Thomas" will suffice. Yes, Sister Thomas. Then I suggest that you obey all the rules. Is there something interesting on the floor, McLean? No, Sister Thomas. Your fears are not an excuse for sinful behavior. You know that you can deal with your fears through prayer. You're simply not trying hard enough. Father Larkin is waiting to hear your confessions. After that you'll walk the grounds for the rest of the day. Christ suffered for you, and now you must learn how to suffer. Because only through suffering can we learn how to love. Can you keep a secret? Of course. You'll never tell, no matter what happens? No. I'm not Catholic. Are you Protestant? Yes. The nuns wouldn't mind. I want to convert. Well then, just tell them. I don't want to just yet. There's so much going on, I'm a little afraid of upsetting things. Will you teach me about your religion so that no one notices? Yes. All right. How do you do confession? Well, you go into the confessional and tell father Larkin your sins. Yes. He'll slide open his window and you'll say, bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been a week-- or however long it's been-- since my last confession. And then you tell him your sins. I had unclean thoughts or wasn't kind to someone. Do you understand? Yes. And then you tell him how many times you did the deed. Then he'll give you a penance. Penance? What kind? Prayers. But first you must learn the act of contrition which you say at the very end while the priest is forgiving you. Repeat after me. Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee. Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee. [father speaking in latin] And I solemnly swear, with the help of thy grace, never to offend thee again. Amen. Go in peace, my child. Thank you, Father. I remembered every word. [jazz playing softly] Thank you. You are a pet. [chuckles quietly] There you are. DORIS: Why aren't you allowed to look at yourself? MAGGIE: The devil will look back at you. DORIS: You don't honestly believe that, do you? MAGGIE: Well, I gazed at myself once in the lake. DORIS: And? Someone else looked back at me. It was terrifying. When I gaze at myself in a mirror my face can take on all sorts of frightening shapes. I do it just to scare myself. It's the eyes playing tricks. [clapping] SISTER THOMAS: The five girls at the front are excused. McLean and Miller will walk until bedtime. Yes, Sister Thomas. DORIS: Do you have any brothers? MAGGIE: No brothers or sisters. What about your parents? My mother and father died when I was just two. They were drowned at sea together. Oh, how dreadful. Well, not really. They're happier than I am. Why is that? The nuns told me everything about them. They were devout Catholics and loved each other very much. And then they died and went to heaven together. Well, I only feel happiness for them, never sad. And after that, they brought me here. Why here, of all places? My mother's dying words were, take Margaret to the good nuns. [doris scoffs] But they are good nuns. They took me in just like you. They fed me, clothed me, educated me. Now, who would do that for you? What about you? Come on. I've told you. My mother died three years ago. My father, last year. I'm very sorry. Well, thank you. So am I. I have a brother though. Older. He's lovely. You'd like him. In fact, I think he'd rather like you. No. Not really. Oh yes, really. Well, where does he live? In America. Oh, I'd like to go there. Enjoy your stroll, ladies? Immensely. My only regret was that you couldn't join us. Oh, we had a lovely supper. Oh, another regret. Bread and drink are one of my favorite dishes. Oh, so it's not good enough for Ms. High-and-Mighty? But Kate, mind your own business. Good evening, girls. GIRLS IN UNISON: Good evening, Sister Thomas. Girls, sit down. Now, I have a surprise for you. Tomorrow Father Power will be visiting the convent. We'll spend the whole day in retreat. Just the older girls. It will be a silent retreat, so there will be no talking whatsoever. We'll offer our silence up for those poor lost souls who fall away from the church each year. Now, come along, girls. We can all knit our way to heaven. What's it for, Sister Thomas? SISTER THOMAS: Our soldiers. There's a long winder ahead. We don't want them to catch cold, do we? There we are, girls. Knit socks. What What size socks, Sister Thomas? GIRL: We should make them as big as Father Larkin's. How big are his? Mass will be at 5:00 o'clock tomorrow, girls. And remember, no talking. [water running] [girls giggling] [water splashing] The church is not part nor member of any other society. It is not mingled in any way with any other society. It is so perfect in itself. But it is distinct from all human societies and stands far above them. [water gushing and splashing] But the Catholic Church is not a community of equals, girls, in which all the faithful have the same rights. It is a society of unequals, not only because among the faithful some are clerics and some are laymen, but particularly in the Church there is the power of God whereby to some it is given to sanctify, teach, and govern, and to others to follow and obey. [water continues splashing] So my message to you girls is to believe and obey, and God will surely reward you with everlasting joy, happiness, peace, and tranquility in the next life. Oh. [groans softly] You can offer the discomfit up to God. [retches] Miller, take McLean outside. What's the matter? Pompous prat. Who? Father Power. He's a priest, Doris. You should show a little more respect. Respect? He said "believe and obey." But they always say that. Do you know what a fascist slogan is? What does fascist mean? Oh, it's the government that controls Italy, a totalitarian state. I'm sorry, Doris, but what does toe-li-tarian mean? Totalitarian is a government where no opposition is allowed. Now, please let me finish. The fascist slogan is "believe, obey, and fight." Now all the soldiers of Christ need are the guns and they can run off and join Hitler and Mussolini. How dare you? How dare I what? Well-- question the goodness of the church. We believe in peace. It's a sin to kill. What about the inquisition? I don't know about that. It's just unfair to say that the church would side with the enemy. They're not the church's enemy, they're England's enemy. Your pious Pope has yet to speak out against the fascist violence in Italy, or the Germans occupation of Poland. He hasn't? Not even the slightest hint of displeasure. I'm sure the Pope's against them. Well, how do you know that unless he speaks out? Because he's a good man. How do you know it? Tell me, how do you know? Because he's the Pope? And? And the Pope is appointed by God. Oh, I see. Oh, well, that explains it. Such a know-it-all. [water rushing] Oh, Maggie. The water's never got this high. Hurry up. Oh, sorry, Sister. That's quite all right. I've checked every pipe. Not a leak anywhere. You need to get a drain put in. I don't understand it at all. It's like one of your miracles. Good day. Good day, Sister. [water splashing] [laughing, screaming] You're such good girls. You must change those clothes immediately before you catch your death of cold. And then we have a little surprise for you. Mother. So we're having a surprise. Cocoa and biscuits. GIRLS IN UNISON: Thank you, Sister Felicity. You're a greedy little Jew, aren't you? You had us all worried for a minute. No, thank you. GIRL: You sure, Doris? They look lovely. No. I'm quite full, really. TILLIE: Maggie? No, thank you. Go on, Tillie. I know you're dying for another one. Good morning, girls. GIRLS IN UNISON: Good morning, Sister Mercy. You may be seated. Girls, you are old enough now that I think it's time you knew exactly what is happening in Africa. Just yesterday I received a letter and, uh, some photographs from Sister Robert Bellamine, who's presently in Kenya. Yes, Corrigan? How is Sister Robert, Sister Mercy? She's very well, and she hopes we are the same. Girls, these African women aren't wearing any clothes at all. Pass the photograph around for everyone to see. And, girls, they're standing in front of African men who are also without clothes. This is what they were like when Sister Robert found them. Now-- She clothed them and taught them English. But most importantly, she taught them about our Lord, Jesus Christ. Girls, over 1,000 pagans were baptized as a result of Sister Robert's work. We should pray for those pagan babies who die each year before sister Robert and others like her can baptize them. As soon as we have the picture of the African men, we can get on with our lesson. SISTER THOMAS: Good morning, Sister Mercy. Sister Thomas. Good morning, girls. GIRLS IN UNISON: Good morning, Sister Thomas. Girls, you may be seated. May I see? Oh, it's Sister Robert. You've heard from her then, have you? Yes, Sister, just yesterday. Is she well? She looks well. Yes, Sister. She's very well. Have you shown this to the girls? Yes, Sister Thomas. Go and wait in my office. Girls, would you stand? You will now walk the grounds until supper. GIRLS IN UNISON: Yes, Sister Thomas. DORIS: The Virgin Mary was born without original sin and yet you say the church doesn't believe in predestination? MAGGIE: Yes. We all have free wills. How do you explain it? Well, God knows what's going to happen beforehand. The mother of God had a be without sin-- original sin or any other sin. He knew that Mary would be pure and never sin, and he knew that she would accept the role as Mother of Christ. Right. So he created her without original sin. But if God knows everything beforehand, then he knew that Adam and Eve would sin. Yes, he did. And because of that original sin and all the sin to come after that, millions of souls would spend eternity in hell. Yes. Why then did he create us? God created us because he loved us. What kind of love is that? VOICE ON RADIO: This allegation caused the strike. The men said they had back all the sweets except those that had become dirty from lying on the floor. The company promised an inquiry tomorrow, and the men went back to work. It has just been learned that an enemy plane flew over the English coast yesterday. [volume increases] The twin engine machine was sighted through gaps in the clouds by two southeast fishermen. The police are investigating an alleged assault-- TILLIE: Tell us the news stories. DORIS: There isn't much to tell, really. LIZZIE: There never is. MAGGIE: Doris, what about that enemy plane? TILLIE: What? DORIS: There was an enemy plane spotted off the southeast coast. LIZZIE: Did we shoot it down? DORIS: No. Two fishermen reported it. They saw it through the clouds. KATE: Probably drunk. LIZZIE: Who's got the photograph? MAGGIE: I thought you had it. TILLIE: No, I haven't got it. LIZZIE: Kate, what about you? KATE: What about me? LIZZIE: Look, I don't care who's got it. I just want to have a look. Oo. Girls, we have a blasphemer in our midst. Would you mind standing, Miller? It's become known to me that Miller doubts whether God loves us. Also, she mocks our blessed Virgin. Sister, I thought that one was allowed to discuss-- I don't want to hear what you think. Does anyone know why we shouldn't think about our religion? Who in the universe is the most intelligent being next to God? The Devil, Sister. Correct, McLean. So why, Miller, do you choose to match your wits with his? The devil will give you many good reasons why you shouldn't believe. He'll make you think you're brilliant when he tricks you into turning your back on God and the Church. But don't listen to him. Don't think about your faith, just believe and the Devil will lose. Now you may be seated. You look just like your mother, God rest her soul. Thank you, sister. I don't look anything like my father, then? I don't know. MAGGIE: Don't you remember him? Who? My father. I never saw the man. (WHISPERING) She doesn't know what she's saying. But I thought you knew my father? Good heavens, no. Your poor mother didn't know which man was your father. How could I possibly know? Don't worry. He won't be back until tomorrow. I found it. Margaret Mary McLean. Here it is. It doesn't matter, Maggie. MAGGIE: Yes, it does. Who will want to marry me now? I had this funny feeling about my parents. Now it all makes sense. [footsteps approaching] [groaning] SISTER FELICITY: No, please. I just want to talk. FATHER LARKIN: Well? What's the matter, darling? SISTER FELICITY: What do you think? FATHER LARKIN: I honestly don't know. SISTER FELICITY: It's-- impossible. FATHER LARKIN: Darling, I know we're in the most ideal situation. SISTER FELICITY: No, it's not that. That was at least bearable. FATHER LARKIN: It was. You don't want to stop, do you? SISTER FELICITY: I have no choice. I'm going to have a baby. FATHER LARKIN: Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. VOICE ON RADIO: With two million troops approaching the gates of Paris and Hitler's armies surging across the Sein, Monsieur Paul Reynaud, the French Prime Minister, broadcast to the world the story of France's anguish, her fight, the heroism of her armies, and the final decision to relinquish Paris. [girls giggling] Privates only. Oh, don't laugh, Doris, you'll crack your face. What's the matter, Doris? Paris is occupied. By what? By Parisians, you twit. [laughter] By Germans. They got it? Yes, they have this marvelous way of just walking in. They gave up? Not yet, but they will. They're all giving up to him. Cowards. They're getting closer and closer. KATE: Well, don't go on about it, Doris. Will you go on about it when they invade? KATE: Look, they don't want us. We've been at war for nine months now and still no bombs. They'd have taken over ages ago. We weren't ready for them. They'll only be 20 miles away. SISTER THOMAS: Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace-- [muttered prayer continues] Stop gloating, girls! [prayers continue] [airplanes flying overhead] SISTER THOMAS: McLean. Would you stand? At this very moment, our country is at war. But what we need, more than airplanes, bombs, tanks, or soldiers, are prayers. We have morning mass and evening prayers specifically for that purpose. Now, for the past three days, McLean has not attended mass, and it's been reported that she refuses to say her evening rosary. Why can't you do your duty to God? I've lost my faith. But if you're questioning your faith, then you must pray to God and ask him to give you strength to overcome the doubt. But I'm not questioning my faith, Sister, I've lost it. I just don't believe in the Church anymore. Then you desperately need to pray. I shall make a special novena for you. And girls, we must all pray to that McLean may regain her faith. (WHISPERING) I don't really want it back. What did you say? I don't really want it back. But how can you turn your back on the church that has fed you and clothed you and educated you? And all that God has asked in return is that you simply love him. I don't know, Sister. I-- I just started to think, my faith is gone. Well then, stop think and your faith will return. You were not brought into this world to think, but to serve God by becoming a good mother or a nun. Remember McLean, the Jesuits think for us, and they're doing a splendid job. They spend years at university learning just how to think. The fact that you would even question them is quite astonishing. Girls, who would you listen to, a Jesuit or McLean? GIRLS IN UNISON: A Jesuit, Sister Thomas. SISTER THOMAS: The loss of faith is pure selfishness. We can do as we please with no one to answer to. Yes. In this life that is true, but in the next life you'll be a sorry sort indeed. Now, McLean, no more listening to the wireless for you or anyone else. This is where you pick up your wicked ideas. You are to spend every hour that you're not asleep on your knees, in your classes, in the dining hall, and in the dormitory. You don't have to pray, but if God sees that you're suffering he may take pity on you and help you back. If you refuse to kneel, I see no alternative but to send you to a reformatory school. Now, down on your knees. You will kneel until tea time. The rest of the class is dismissed. Doris. I'm sorry about the wireless. I don't understand, why have you turned on me like this? You should learn to keep some things to yourself. Not only because it's polite, but sometimes necessary for survival. How do you mean? Well, let me ask you this. How do your knees feel? I think you enjoy all this punishment. Allow me. [water running] VOICE ON THE RADIO: That the ringing of church bells is now banned, except to give warning of enemy parachutists or troops-- [radio cuts off] You frightened me. You'll be a lot more frightened if you keep this up. I said no wireless, and I meant just that. Now get back to your dormitory. [shouting] VOICE ON THE RADIO: Do not make any trips by rail or road in a strip of the East coast 20 miles deep from the wash down to Sussex, the Ministry of Home Security stated. [crashing] SISTER THOMAS: There we are. [airplanes flying over] Cowards! [screaming] Bitch! [crashing] [groaning] [screams] You know, [inaudible] suits you. Your face will be all right tomorrow. Now these hands might take a week to heal, but I'm afraid, Maggie, we're going to have to give you a shot. Now, this won't hurt a bit. Thank you. Thank you so much, doctor. That's perfectly all right, Sister. Mother Perpetua would like to see you. Yes. Well, I'll see to her right away. You must tell me exactly who is responsible for this dreadful deed. Why? So you can punish them? Yes. I can't do that. Then all the girls will suffer. Even today I still regret that, in spite of all my efforts, I have not succeeded in achieving that friendship with England which, as I believe, would have been a blessing for both peoples. I was not successful in spite of determined and honest efforts. What is it? It's from Hitler. We're expecting more raids this week, so we advise you to evacuate as soon as possible. SISTER THOMAS: Advise, but not demand? WARDEN: Very strongly advising, Sister. SISTER THOMAS: Well, the council advised me only yesterday to, quote, "stay put." And that, Warden, is exactly what we intend to do. Why aren't you walking with the other girls? (WHISPERING) I want to talk to you. Good day, Warden. Where's Doris? She's asked to join the convent. What? LIZZIE: She didn't even say her prayers properly. Sister Thomas says it's always the ones you least expect. MAGGIE: Has Sister Thomas accepted her? Yes. KATE: Can't get over it. They'll take anyone. [knocking] What are you doing here? I'm joining the order. I-- I want to serve the church. Don't lie to me. I'm not. I see where I've gone wrong. You I don't believe. I know you don't. What are you going to do? You're not going to tell anyone, are you? Why are you doing this? I can't say. MAGGIE: I'm your friend! I can't! MAGGIE: Will you go through with the vows? I can't let you do that. You're not even Catholic! Shh! You promised never to tell! Maggie, I'm afraid. Of the Germans. DORIS: Of everything. Doris, there's nothing to be frightened of. You'd be frightened. I'm not afraid of anything. Well, good for you. SISTER THOMAS: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death. Amen. [prayer continues] [distant gunfire] Where's Maggie? Still in bed. She won't come. Why didn't you say something? It won't do any good. We tried to get her down here, but she wouldn't hear of it. She just kept saying, it's just an air raid and I'm not bothered. [prayer continues] Holy Mary, mother of God pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death. Amen. [airplanes overhead] [distant gunfire] [bombing] SOLDIER: Get away from that gun! Move! Move it! Oh, look! [clapping] Girls, go to your dormitories and wait until I call you. Sister Thomas Aquinas. Yes. I am Major Manly. Major, you do not have permission to be on these premises, and I would like you to remove this weapon and your men immediately. I'm afraid we don't need your permission. What? We require these premises for an anti-tank battery. You're set to leave at 1900 hours. What are you talking about? Evacuating the school. And what if I refuse? You shall be removed. [car horn beeps] After careful consideration I have decided that it's best for us to evacuate the convent tonight. [murmuring among girls] Quiet, girls. Remember, God protects those who are good. Yes, Buxton? Are the Germans going to invade? SISTER THOMAS: At this point that is something only God knows. Girls, this is a very dangerous time indeed. It's extremely important that we remain pure, constantly in the state of grace. These soldiers-- girls, remember, you must never look them in the eye. Always look down. They are men, and looking them in the eye can give rise to temptation. If they should then sin through thought, word, or deed, then you would be sinning as well. For, as you know, we are all responsible for one another's sins. If they should talk to you, ignore them. You will be a blessing in disguise. Now everyone, back to your dormitories to pack. You'll be leaving at 7:00 o'clock. [loud breath] Kate, that mirror isn't yours. - Is now. - No, it isn't. It's Doris's. She doesn't need it now. That's got nothing to do with it. It's her mirror. Here, Lizzie, help me with it! [crashing] You stupid idiot, that's seven years' bad luck. Look, it's a letter or something. Might be money. It's none of your business! LIZZIE: Go on. Read it. KATE: I can't. I think it's German. That's impossible. Let me see! No, it's German. What did I tell you, Mary? Didn't I say there was something wicked about her? She's wicked all right. I'm taking her to Sister Thomas. Oh, Maggie, what's going on? I just came to say good bye. You lied to me. When did you arrive from Germany? Arrive? I've only been there twice. Oh, well then they trained you here? DORIS: For what? To spy. Spy? MAGGIE: We found your letter. But that note is from my brother. You told me that your brother lived in America. That letter was from Germany. I wish he did live in America, but he's in Germany. MAGGIE: And what does he do in Germany? Not much. Who taught you how to read German? DORIS: Hitler. God. You'd believe anything. Can you read German? No. DORIS: Then how do you know I'm a spy? Who is it? MAGGIE: Maggie McLean, Sister. Come in, McLean. Sister, it's extremely important. Don't speak until you have calmed yourself down. Doris isn't a spy. I know it. Would you mind lowering your voice? Doris is really Jewish. Her parents were German Jews. That's why she knows German. She wants to convert. She's afraid that if the Germans invade she'll be persecuted. She says she's sorry for all the trouble she's caused. And you believed everything she said? MAGGIE: Yes. Don't you realize that a spy will tell you anything to make you believe that they are not a spy? Sister, Doris isn't a spy! Lower your voice. MAGGIE: She's my friend. Well, your friend has cast an evil spell over you with her wicked ideas. When the letter's read then you'll know she's not a spy. SISTER THOMAS: Even if she weren't a spy, I wouldn't have her back. She's been nothing but trouble since she arrived. We'll be leaving soon, so I suggest you finish your packing. Did you hear what I said? MAGGIE: Yes. Well, then do as I say. I'm not going with you. SISTER THOMAS: Do as you please. What? You are so ungrateful, McLean. When you were weak and in need, I prayed for you. We all prayed for you. Saint Dymphna gave you courage, and in return for her help you decided to leave the Church. You could believe if you wanted to, but you don't because the path is too difficult. As far as I'm concerned, when you say that you don't want to believe you are actually saying that you want to sin. You don't belong with us. Sister, I don't want to leave just yet. SISTER THOMAS: But you've already left the Church. Are you at all interested in regaining your faith? No. SISTER THOMAS: Then why do you want to stay with us? This is my home. GIRL: Maggie, where are you? GIRL: Come on, Maggie, you'll miss the bus! GIRL: Come on then, Maggie, we're going! GIRL: Maggie! GIRL: Maggie, come on. Hurry up! She still thinks you're a spy. Well, the Soldiers have decided I'm not. But everybody's left. Really? She doesn't want us in the convent anymore. It doesn't matter. You can always come to London with me.
