We ain't licked yet major, they'll never lick us. Artillery prepared for action sir. At the command, fire at will, take your post. - Do they see the flag major? - Their colonel can't help seeing it. Fire. You sure settled their hash colonel. - Burial detail. - First platoon, fall out. Hey, the war is over, throw away your carbine soldier. - Throw it away. - The war is over. - War is over. - Hey, we won. The Rebels quit. - Johnny, hi Johnny. - Hi you Jericho. - You alright kid? - Don't call me kid. Alright, I just wanted to know how you made out yet. Still wet nursing with little brother sarge? No, he ain't too little. - War is over, colonel. - When did it happen? Lee surrendered at Appomattox this morning. - So it's finally over. - Yes sir. Wonderful news, isn't it? - Wonderful. - I gave the men permission celebrate. They seem to been making a pretty good job of it. Dismount. Any further celebration will be confined to the tent lines. - Yes sir. - Lead off. I killed a hundred men today. I didn't want to, I couldn't help myself. What's wrong with me? I'm afraid, afraid I'm going crazy. No. No, it was the war, that's all. But the war is over now. I can stop, I'm safe, God helping me. Come on in Del, everything under control? You look like something is bothering you. - Something is. - Come on out with it. Just, what happened this morning. A hundred men killed, with the war over. I hate it Del. Hate it. Thinking about it makes me sick, sick and ashamed. They could've run up a white flag. They wouldn't, that's not your fault. Thanks for saying that Del. Forget it, relax. Well, we made it, didn't we? - Yeah, sometimes I thought we wouldn't. - I never had any doubts. That's why you're the colonel. Don't talk that way, we've been a team, a good team, all the way. We'd better check the sentry lines. - I thought somebody said the war was over. - We're not out of the Army yet, come on. - My feet hurt. - You haven't been riding on your feet. When are you going to get the ramrod out of your back? The minute we're out of uniform, so quick your eyes will pop. - If the captain is ready, move. - Yes sir, colonel. Yes sir. - Who's in charge of this post? - Sergeant Howard sir. - Take it easy Owen. - Sergeant of the guard. Hi, colonel. I, I mean mister, he's a civilian same as me, have a drink. Put this man under arrest. McGuire. Judd. - Take his side arm. - Come on Jericho. - I wish I didn't have to do that. - Nothing else you could do. Jericho is been a good soldier. If anybody in the regiment who should know... better than to drink on sentry duty, he should. Meantime, how about you getting some sleep? You'd better do the same, I want to start for home first thing in the morning. - The soldiers are coming. - Here they come. - Caroline, Caroline... - Just a minute. Come on Caroline, we don't want to miss anything. Hello Doc. - Proud of your nephew, ain't you doc? - You bet I am. Never thought he'd get to be a colonel, didn't you? Oh yes, he did. - You think he'll take the job? - Oh, sure he will, I know Devereaux. Federal judge is a big job, especially for a man that young. Any man who handles that bunch in a war time... can make law abiding citizens out of them in peace. And that's what we want. The soldiers are coming. The soldiers are coming. - Take the men on into Glory Hill. - You leaving us colonel? For the time being Captain, just for the time being. - Hi colonel, glad to see you back. - Great work colonel. - I want to shake the hand of a real hero. - Oh, welcome home Del. How are you my boy? - Fine, uncle. Fine. - You look it. - Good to see you Owen. - Thank you. Now, what do you think? Hey, you sure aged since I saw you last, Owen. I'll take that as a compliment Mr. Trumble. A wonderful reception the men are getting, wonderful. You ain't seen nothing yet, wait till the dance tonight. - Caroline... - Excuse me Miss Emmet. - First dance Caroline? - Of course. Oh, that can wait till tonight, business before pleasure. - We want to get a couple of things settled. - What things? The biggest surprise you ever had. - Del. - Hello Caroline. Everything under control at camp captain? - Everything is fine, colonel. - Oh, it's been a long time. 3 years and 2 hours and 20 minutes too long. Excuse us colonel while I make up for lost time. Why, certainly. You look wonderful, now I know why I wanted to be a civilian again. There's so many people around here I can't hear a word you saying. - Evening Captain. - Evening Crawford. I've been waiting for a chance like this for a long time, now... I know what you're going to say Del but don't, not yet. After all, you've been home less than 3 hours. - 2 hours and 20 some odd minutes. - I need more time than that. Owen kind of got a head start on me, didn't he? Oh, that's not it Del. It's just that I want to think things out, I'd wish you'd understand. I'm trying to. - There's one thing you can be sure of. - I know Del. And I'm proud that you feel that way about me. It's just that I'm not quite sure enough about myself, I have to be. I want you to be, I'll keep asking you every so often. Thank you Del. - My dance Captain? - Your dance colonel. You boys are sure missing the fine time at the dance tonight. Well, so are you. I heard they got barbecue pork, roast beef, fried chicken and all free too. I don't want to hear about it. Plenty of free drinks too. - I said, I don't want to hear about it. - Must be lots of pretty girls there too. Don't matter if you're fat or lean. They're proud to dance with a soldier. Yes sir, laugh and dance and talk and make a man mighty glad he's home from the war. Jericho, shut up, just shut up now. I don't know why you 2 don't walk on up to... Glory Hill anyhow and have yourselves a little drink. We ain't going nowhere and neither are you. I wouldn't trust you no further that I can stick this. Careful, I ain't even been court-martialed yet. Don't yell, just don't yell. - Now we're all in trouble. - I said, be quiet. Now stay there. - The colonel will have me shot. - He'll just give you life in jail. Take me with you Jericho. I'm going to live off the country, instead of the country living off me. - You want to try that? - It's that or get court martial myself. Alright, come on. We won't be needing you, get. - Everybody is so proud of you Owen. - Are they? It's really wonderful to have you and Del back home again. The town hasn't been the same without you. I suppose you'll open up your law office again, won't you? There's an office around over Charlie Trumbull's store. As a matter of fact, Mrs. Trumbull told me to... be sure and tell you about it before you made plans. You talk too much. Ladies and gentlemen, veterans, friends, I know I'm not telling you any news when I say... this is the greatest night in the history of our great little city. We welcome and we thank the brave volunteers who... who kept the road open to the Union and who saved our Colorado gold from the invader. But words are not enough. Action, that's what we all want and that's what... this man is here for, Mr. Roger MacDonald from Denver. Special representative of the territorial governor... has a very important announcement to make. - Mr. MacDonald. - Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to be able to announce... that the territorial governor, at the request of your leading citizens... has appointed as the first federal judge in this district... Colonel Owen Devereaux. - Owen, how wonderful? - Why didn't you tell us about it? I hadn't made up my mind, haven't yet. Now it's up to Colonel Devereaux. I just want to say one thing. I didn't ask for my job in the Army... I was elected to it by the volunteers who served with me. So now, unless those same men and you home folks here... tell me that I'm the man you want for judge, I... I don't want the job and I won't accept it. - Well alright folks, how about it? - Yeah. Thanks, I'll do my best to do a good job. - Thank you. - Congratulations Owen. Your dance judge. Colonel, Jericho Howard busted out, he escaped, him and Mutton McGuire. Alright, dismissed. - We'll have to get back to camp. - You think it's that important Owen? First desertion on our record and only 2 days before we're muster out. - Will you forgive me? - Of course Owen. See you tomorrow Caroline, as soon as I can get off duty. - Good night. - Good night. I think I'll walk down the street with you boys, need a little fresh air. Alright, come along Doc. What are you going to do about Jericho Howard? - Report him as a deserter. - The same for Mutton McGuire? Let's leave the rest of it to the Army and talk a little civilian business. Del, I want you to be my federal marshal. For the first time in your life, you're not making sense. Me, a federal marshal? I wouldn't have any other man in the job, we've been a team too long brake it up now. Owen is right Del, absolutely right. Look, in the first place, I'm not cut out to be a marshal or anything like it. In the second place, after bossing men around for three years, I'd... like to stay away from any job that has official tagged to it. - I thought you felt the same way. - I did and I still do, why... I didn't ask for the judge's job, but I got it and now I need help. So I'm not going to let you turn me down. Well, I'll think it over but don't count on me. Why, sure I'll count on you, the same as always. Colonel Devereaux? Yes, what do you want? I want to look at a hero. I want to ask you about this. I don't know what you talking ab... I'm talking about the white flag you saw my men put up at Jacob's Gorge. You could've taken us without firing a shot. But you killed them, under a flag of surrender. You killed 100 decent men, what for colonel? For a morning's entertainment? For pure, crazy love of killing? You're no hero, you an insane murderer. Well, now it's your turn to die, you'll, you'll need... You didn't have to kill him, you had him covered, he couldn't have... Did see that white flag? - What happened Captain? - Who is he? - He's a Reb officer. - How did he get here Captain? Just a man that didn't believe the war was over. Well, it's over now for him. Take care of him. Yes sir, get going, we'll take care of this. York, Morris, Saunders... Del, Del... That Rebel, he didn't know what he was saying. A man hurt that bad, and what he'd been through. Tell me something Doc. Could the war get a man, a decent man like Owen, so... well, sick that he can't stop killing? Del, you've known Owen almost as long as I have. You don't mean to tell me you really believe what that crazy Rebel said? Won't do us any good to lie to each other Doc. There's something wrong with him, we both know it. I don't like what I just saw but war affects different men in different ways. Time, that's what men need when they get back from a war. Time and people standing by that really care about them and believe in them. What if that's not enough to cure what's wrong with Owen? I'm not saying it's anything wrong with him. I am. If you really think that Del... you'd be a poor friend to go back on him now when he just got in home... starting the biggest and hardest job he's ever had. You can't let him down Del, any more than I can. - I don't want to. - Then you got to take the marshal's job. I'll make a deal with Owen. If he'll take that gun off and stick to being judge, I'll take the job. - Not otherwise Doc. - That's fine Del. Fine. You do solemnly swear that you will uphold and defend... the Constitution of the United States? That you will well and faithfully discharge... the duties of the office as federal marshal... and that you will at all times serve and enforce the law, without favor or fear - so help you God? - So help me God. - Well, that's that. Congratulations Marshal. - Thanks judge. - Yes Del, that deal goes all the way. - I'll count on that Owen. Del... - I'm mighty happy about this. - Thanks Doc. - So am I. - Thank you Caroline. - Captain? - Make it marshal. Yes sir. Marshal, we're kind of a committee. We want you to come over and see Corporal Dickson. - What's he up to? - He's down, down flat on his back. - Over at camp, in his shack. - There's been some trouble. Maybe you'd better come along too Owen. Why, you don't need me Marshal, sounds more like you need Doc. - Howdy son. - Hi you Doc, howdy Captain. What happened Dickson? I, I went to work my claim, as soon as I got my discharge yesterday. You know my claim, told you about it many a time. Four men I'd, I'd never seen before in my life... told me to get off of Ed Carter's property. They grabbed me, held me up against a rock and... pistol whipped me. They pistol whipped him until he couldn't stand, booted him. He has some broken ribs. He laid up there till way last night, crawl in here. Couldn't even talk at first. He's not the only one, we all got warned. Any man that trespasses on Ed Carter's property will be in trouble, so they said. Charlie Trumbull says we got no claims... says the Great Star Mining Company owns the whole shebang. Too many guns around here, get them out of sight. We're out of the Army, all done taking orders. I'm talking to civilians. Any man that thinks he can settle his... business with a gun, I'll have to put him under arrest. I don't want to do that to any of you if I can help ti. Or what do you ask to do? Let the gang that stay home while we... fought the war and rob us blind and no even put our a fight? Save that till I see the judge. - The judge? You mean, the colonel? - That's right Johnny. Doc, do you think you could have him in shape to be in court in an hour? - I'll be there Captain. - You'll be flat on your back if you are. Alright, bring him in on a cot. You men be there too. And round up any of the other fellows that have a complaint or think they have. But remember, no guns. You men argue that the Great Star Mining Company is... illegally in possession of your property. Now that's on the basis of miners' law... a local agreement among miners who prospected here before the war. Who is got a better right to make miners' laws... than the men that found the gold, in the first place, that's us. - It's right. - Yeah. We've heard your testimony corporal. Are there any other witnesses? - Yes sir. Me. - Alright Johnny. My brother Jericho and me had a claim before the war. A good claim that we found and staked out according miners' law. Right spang in the middle of what Ed Carter claims is his now. - Well, I mean to dig that claim. - Good boy. A man is got a right to keep what he found. We've heard one side of the case, now let's hear the other. - Mr. Carter. - Why yes Owen, I mean Your honor. Colorado is now a federal territory. Someday and someday soon... Colorado is going to add another bright star to that glorious flag. Let's get to the point. Alright judge, I'll get to the point. Miners' law went out when federal law came in. The US government says a man who doesn't work his claim at all in any 3 years period... loses all rights to that claim. The judge knows where we've been the last three years, he was there with us. Yes, I know where you've been too... but you men can't live on the war the rest of your lives. We don't want to, we want what belonged to us before the war, still ours. But it doesn't and no man here can say I haven't acted... acted in absolute strict accordance with federal law. Law, law, that's all we hear. And it's all your law Mr. Carter, all for you and none for us. You know as well as we do judge, the only gold around here is up on Yellow Mountain. - Why should he have all of it? - Yeah, that's right. Your honor, I'd like to get something off my chest. Alright, go ahead. I can't argue law and I won't try to, but fact is fact. These men came to Colorado to pan a fortune, the same as Mr. Carter. They had property when they left. And now they're been told they lost what they had while fighting for their country. They can't make a leaving as their claims were taken away from them. Oh, I'll hire every man honorably discharged from the regiment and glad to do it. Hooray, hire us to work our own claim. I'll pay top wages, 60 dollars a month, cash on the barrel-head. A man can't live on that and you know it Ed. You come work for me Ed. I'll pay you 65 a month and throw in a pair of shoes every other Christmas. Let's have order. I'm in a peculiar position here, my sympathy and... personal feelings are the same as the marshal's. I know what you men are up against. But my personal feelings can't enter into my decision as a federal judge. Now, if I ruled in your favor, my... Well, my decision would be reversed by a court of appeals. Now, if there's injustice in the law, that's a matter for Congress in Washington not... not for this court. In accordance with the law, the lands here in dispute... whose claimants did no work on them within... the three years immediately preceding the date of this action... are public lands and subject to preemption. Therefore, I am compelled to rule that the defendant in this action... the Great Star Mining Company is legally the owner of the lands preempted. I'll have to make part of the record here that anyone found trespassing on the... Great Star Mining Company's property after this date... does so in defiance of the law and at his own risk. Court is adjourned. - It's quite a session you let me in for. - I'd hoped it would turn out differently. I wish it could've. Forget about that for now, it's something more important. What is it? Brace yourself because I'm going to kick you in the teeth. You won't like it right at first, I don't like doing it. But we've always been on the level you and I and I'd like to stay that way. Del, Caroline and I decided to get married a week from today. I wanted you to know about it before Caroline gets here, she'd be here in a few minutes. I won't pull the old line about... The best man wins, call it the lucky man. No, Owen. Don't you think that Caroline is the only one who have the right to say no or yes? Alright, we've always been on the level with each other. There's something wrong with you Owen. I don't know what it is exactly. Maybe you don't know either. But I think you ought to go away for a while. Take a rest, get hold of yourself. Go away? - Take a rest? - Until you're like your old self again. You probably think I say this because I'm in love with Caroline too, I am. But believe me, six months from now I'll be best... man at the wedding and give the bride away, if you want me to. Just not now. You know, I don't have to take this kind of talk Del, even from you. Yes, you do Owen, I'll ask you what the Rebel major asked you. Why did you have to kill his men? Why did you have to kill him? You can't answer that, can you? Maybe you don't dare answer it, even to yourself. You're sick inside Owen, you're too sick to marry. I'm not sick. Now, you get that very clear in your mind, I'm not sick. I'm not leaving, now or any other time. No Del, I'm going to marry Caroline a week from today, don't try to stop it, don't try. No, you can't marry her the way you are now, you can't do that to her. Get out of here, get out. Oh, stop it Owen, you're acting like a crazy man. Del. Left the wedding kind of early, didn't you? - Thought I might be of more use here. - Never needed a doctor less. Del, you're not making this any easier on either one of us. I know how you feel today, in one way I can't blame you. Doc, this marriage is all wrong. You know as well as I do, Owen isn't fit to marry Caroline or anyone else. If anything on earth will get Owen straightened out, it's this marriage. He needs her, her love can cure him, if nothing else will. - I wish I could believe that. - I believe it. Just so you don't go back on him, walk out on Owen. I'm not going to quit my job, if that's what you mean. I feel better hearing you say that Del. Runaway, runaway, runaway. I'll be right back dear. Alright folks, stand back, here. Come on, give them room, give them room, come on. Now, take it easy with him. Tom, Tom Barton, come on out of it, now Tom. The gold is gone, cleaned out. Well, bring him to, do something. Come on Tom talk, what happened to the gold shipment? Gone, two men... uniforms. I couldn't see faces. They had masks. I shot one. Two men in uniform, go on Tom. Tom. He's dead. - You heard him Marshal, two men in uniform. - You better get a posse together. I want volunteers. - Come on, speak up. - You got me Marshal, for one. - I will as soon I get home and get my gun. - I'm in. - Alright, I'm in. - Me too. - I thought we made a deal. - We did. Then what's the idea of the gun? I'd look pretty silly going along without one, let's go. Let's have your gun. Get off that horse quick. Turn around. Now walk. And while you're walking, say your prayers. Dismissed, colonel. - What happened judge? - Where's your horse? - He threw me and got away. - I'll pick him up. Forget it. - What do we do with him judge? - Plenty of trees right handy. There'll be no lynching. That's right Marshal, there'll be no lynching. This man is entitled to a trial, he'll have it, right here and now. Hello Johnny. Is Jericho been around? He's not here and he's not going to be here. I hope you're right. - Want a drink? - I'm particular who I drink with. So am I. And I don't drink with a man that just hung a friend of mine. I didn't hang anybody Johnny. Oh, Mutton McGuire just put a rope around his own neck. That's about what he did. I've never known any man who got anything but the worst of it running up against the law. Mutton McGuire was a good soldier. He was a good man. Kind of a bad man to imitate. - How you corporal? - I get along. I figured you'd be on the other side of the bridge. Celebrating victory for law, order and Judge Devereaux. I've got nothing to celebrate. Johnny, Kilroy, come on. Johnny. Go on out back, somebody is waiting to see you. - Jericho? - Yeah. He's got his nerve, coming right into town after today. He brought a half a dozen horses in, looking for men to ride them. I told him I'd go with him. Any of you men feel like joining up with us? Sixty a month is not much. Especially for digging gold out of my own claim that Carter jumped. But at least it's honest money. It's better than getting hung like Mutton McGuire. Maybe it's better if you're not man enough to fight for what's yours. It's not good enough for me. You get yourself one man anyhow. Make that two. Better keep out of this, you got a wife and kids. I got nobody to hold me back. If we can't get our rights by the law, take them without. - That all? - I'll go with you. I'd like to go but I, I can't do it. Too much to think of at home. Alright, think of it. - I'm ready too. - Come on. - I wish you boys luck. - You'll sure need it. - You looking pretty good kid. - I'm alright. - How you've been? - Oh, not too bad, considering. You're as thin as a starved cat. I guess it's from missing the old Army beans. Oh, here, I figured that maybe you could use some eating supplies yourself. - Gold. Well, where you get it? - Off our claim. I dug it out of one of Big Ed's hired hands, same place I got the horses. - Here's your army Jericho. - Hi Jericho. - You men sure you want to get into this? - Sure, we're sure. Might as well get what we can. - It is better be gone. - Nothing left for us here. Hey. - Get down off of there. - Jericho, don't make me. These are grown men Johnny with nothing to lose but their necks. You're a kid, you still got a chance. - But Jericho... - It's only us 2 Howards left in this world. One of us is going to live to be a grand-dad. Now, come on. So long kid, behave yourself. - What did you wish Caroline? - Just that Del could be here. Oh, I asked him to come, but he said he was too busy. It just doesn't seem right, not being here for my birthday. Oh, well... The trouble is you could only marry one of us. Oh, if I didn't know how you really felt about Del, I'd think you were jealous. Eat your cake. I'll go. Howdy ma'am. We'd like to see the judge. - He's just having his dinner. - That's alright Caroline, come on in. - Well, what is it? - We got fired today. Ed Carter's gun guards run us off the property. Why were you fired? It's been too many holdups and we've all been too friendly to Jericho Howard. That's what Ed Carter says. Well, I'm afraid it's up to him to say who works for him. Sure. But judge, we're abiding by the law you laid down. Even though we still think we're digging our own gold for Ed Carter, we digging it. Because we got families to feed. We claim we've done nothing to get fired for. Except they used to be my brother's friends, used to be. Calm down Johnny. You men can't blame Mr. Carter for taking precautions. I don't blame him for anything, I blame you. Jericho was alright till you broke him, why you break him? Just because you won't let any man stand up to you. He's running the hills because you drove him to it. Him and the others, good men that fought their heart out for you. But you treated them like dirt. Any man is dirt to you, you're so crazy with power, just plain crazy. That's enough, get out. Maybe you don't believe it judge, but there's two kinds of justice... yours and other people's, just don't forget that. Get out. Owen, I've never seen you like this. The men didn't mean anything. Johnny Howard is just a boy so worried about his brother he doesn't... Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about him, he's just on edge. - Any man that... - I think you'd better go Doc. Why can't you leave me alone? That's five. Your five... and five more. I'll fold. I'll raise five more. That's right, just sat still. Which one of you knows how to open that safe? I'll give you one minute to make up your mind. You got a half a minute left. Easy. Nice and easy. Alright, that's plenty. Tell Mr. Carter I'm leaving him two sacks to pay his expenses for digging up our gold. Now sit back down and finish your card game before you start to raise any commotion. They ride into town, they ride out again with 90,000 dollars of my money. What's done about it? Nothing, absolutely nothing. The marshal and the posse go out, the marshal and the posse come back. No prisoners, nothing but a lot of excuses. They're veterans, so they can get away with anything. Get a few things straight Mr. Carter. Those men wouldn't be running the hills if they've... been given a fair break when they first came home. So, in what side of this thing are you on anyhow? Your side, that's my job. But if you can name one man in this town who lifted a... finger to help those men get a decent start... I'll eat your hat. - Why, I hired them. I... - Sure, sure, you hired them. At pay they couldn't live on. Then you fired them when you found out they were friends of Jericho Howard. No wonder some of them joined up with him. Fine state of affairs, when a federal marshal stands up in... front of a federal judge in defense of a bunch of murdering outlaws. I'm not defending any outlaws... but I'm telling you this town it'd better wake up or there'll be more outlaws. You know Andy, he's right in a way. A lot of men are pretty hard up and mad. Seems to me we ought to be able to do something for them. We sure we will, after we get some law and order back in this part of the country. I hold you responsible Owen. We're not getting what we counted on from you by a long shot, we want action. That's what you'll get. The men who robbed you and killed Rawson will be... caught and hanged within the next 48 hours. - Let's get going. - Where do we start? Over in Glory Hill, where we should've started in the first place. On who? When you boys get back in town? Who said we ever left? I still bet Jericho saw us looking for him, he was just too ornery to let us know. Two days is as long as I'll look for any man, even Jericho. If he don't want us near that pit, then we might forget about it. - And try something else. - Try what? - You boys hear what happened last night? - Yeah, we slept out and rained. Where you've been the last couple of days? We've just been traveling around, that's all Marshal. - Looking for... - We weren't looking for anything. That's right, we were just looking. - Who this is belong to? - Me. Where you get it? Why Ed Carter gave it to me, didn't you know he's my friend? That's kid talk Johnny. Somebody emptied Mr. Carter safe last night... and got away with 90,000 dollars worth of that stuff. What do you know about it? Not a thing, except it's the best news I've heard since General Lee called off the war. You ever see this before? - This isn't your gun, is it? - Maybe. Where you see it before? You tell me when and I'll tell you where. Johnny, a man was killed in that holdup last night. - That's his hard luck. - No, it's yours, if you shot him. - I don't think you did. - I don't care what you think. Alright, I'm going to lock you up, all of you. Until one of you gets sense enough to talk straight, come on. The gun, the sack of gold dust... and where you were when Ed Carter's office was robbed. Three things against you Johnny. That might be enough to hang you. Do you understand that? You're not helping Jericho. You don't want to hang for something you didn't do. You got your whole life ahead of you Johnny. Did he tell you anything? - You wouldn't believe him if he did. - No, I wouldn't. - Not with the evidence we've got. - I still say Johnny wasn't in on it. - How do you know? - I know him. He's protecting his brother or trying to anyhow. Well, you have a right to your personal opinion. I've to go on facts. The law states that a man is innocent until proved guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. - I know the law. - Alright. Then put off the trial for a few days. Why should I? I'll give you reason enough. I want time to find Jericho Howard and bring him in. You haven't done very well about finding him up to now. I made a mistake by having a posse with me. Del, I've gone along with you as far as I can. - If you were in my place... - I'd give Johnny Howard a chance to live. This is one time I intend to have things my way Owen. I don't want that kid touched until I get back. I don't take orders, not from you or anyone else. You'll take this one. Don't hang Johnny Howard. - You've been hard to find Jericho. - I haven't been lost Marshal. Now that you're in here, how do you figure on getting out? - That's up to you to say. - You bet it is. Any idea I'm going to give you any of the best of it? That depends on weather you want your kid brother to hang for a killing you did. Say that again. When I left town 2 nights ago judge Devereaux was getting... ready to try John for the shooting of a man named Rawson... in the holdup of Ed Carter's office. - Johnny had no part of that job. - I know he didn't. But it's enough evidence to hang him. He had a sack of gold dust and... somebody dropped a gun outside Ed Carter's office with... J. Howard carved on the handle. - They can't convict the kid on just that. - Maybe not. But what will convict him is the fact he won't defend himself. Won't say a word. He thinks he's protecting you. Add it all up Jericho and see what you get. That crazy, know nothing kid. That's what he is alright. He's going to swing for it unless you make a move in a hurry. - You're asking me to...? - I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you. You're going to dance on a rope end sooner or later anyhow. But Johnny is kind of young to die for nothing but cockeyed loyalty to his brother. That's why I say it's up to you. Who pays your bills Jericho? You or Johnny? You coming with me? Move over to the other place. I'll see you there. Give him his gun. Alright Marshal, you got your man. What you waiting for? Johnny. Colonel Devereaux's justice? I just saw Johnny Howard. You had to hang him. Just because you had another chance to kill a man you couldn't resist it. I stood by you Owen, let you go on being federal judge. I thought I could stand between you and people like Johnny Howard. Keep you from any more killing, I was wrong. There's only one way to stop you. And that's to take the power of life and death from you, finish you. And that's what I'm going to do, any way I can. You still won't get Caroline. It was on the front door. Aren't you going to say anything? Everyone was talking at the store. Owen, how can you hang five men? Five more? They had their trial. You convicted them on no more evidence than there was against Johnny Howard. Just because they were with him. Because they were guilty. I think you'd better come with me Caroline. To watch you hang them? To show the town that my wife believes in me. I have a right to ask that. How can I stand by you in this? First Del, now you. Owen, Del is the best friend you ever had. He wouldn't turn against you without such good... Cause that he had to, any more than I would. I, I try to understand you. I can't, I just can't. You believe this because Del believes it. Because you're in love with Del. - You always were. - That's not true Owen. Do you love me? You won't let me anymore. Come on, jump in. Let's go. It won't do, it just won't. What happened today will be all over Colorado. We got a war in our hands, that's what it amounts to. Next thing to plain armed rebellion, soldiers shooting at civilians. - They're not soldiers. - They were. They were your own men, which makes it look all the worse for you. Your own best friend is running the gang... The man you that you insisted on having for marshal. Del Stewart will hang. The same as any of the rest of them when I get him. If you get him. Owen, we need somebody else running things... that's not mixed up in this mess personally the way you are. To get things quieted down, which I don't believe you can ever do. I'm a federal judge. One man can put me out of office, that's the territorial governor. I come over as quick as I could judge. Good night. Hi fellows, I hardly expected to see you around. How about me buying a drink to kind of celebrate your, your good health? Three. - Funny thing, I lost my thirst. - Me the same. Funny thing. I'll... have to drink alone then. Seems a shame. Yeah, seems a shame to say no to a popular man like you. You wouldn't believe what a popular man you are. Anywhere you go, somebody is sure to tell somebody. What you doing over Judge Devereaux's house? Why... He wanted to know if I knew where Del Stewart is. I told him no, of course. Even if I did know, why, I wouldn't tell anything on Del Stewart. - You boys know that. - You don't want to lie at the wrong people. I remember in the Army, you were always very careful not to get yourself hurt. You're too old to change your habits now. Save your money, you might need it. What are you shaking about? You can tell Del Stewart something if you want to. If you see him. His lady friend is in plenty of trouble. You wouldn't mean Mrs. Devereaux, would you? I don't know any other lady friend he ever had. Things are mighty bad in that house. The judge is keeping her locked her up, no telling what he might do to her. She asked me to get a message to Del Stewart. Said she needs help. But if I can't find him, I... I can't tell him. Well... I'll see you boys around some more. Claims he's got a message for you from Mrs. Devereaux. When did you see Mrs. Devereaux? - This evening at her house. - He was there alright. She's in trouble with the judge. She grabbed me just as I was leaving, told me she wants to see you. She has to see you, that's what she said. Find Del Stewart, she said to me. Tell him that if he... still cares anything at all about me, he'd better come and see me tonight. You don't have to believe it. I've got nothing to lose if you don't. Still dog robbing for the colonel, the same as always. He'd sell his mother for two bits and give you change. The idea is to draw you out in the open, no matter how. I don't know which is the lowest... the judge or this. I'll have to go over there. - You're a fool if you do. - Alright, I'm a fool. Maybe your friends ought to stop you for your own good. Alright, a few of us will go along, just in case. One man is enough. Let's go. Remember, I'll be right behind you, all the way. Come on, come on, hurry up. Hold it. Get him locked up. Get out of town before morning and don't come back. Alright, just a moment. Why Caroline, come in. - What is it Caroline? Anything wrong? - Owen just arrested Del. Doc, he's going to hang him, murder Del with the law. - Caroline, I can't believe it. - You'll believe Owen, won't you? Caroline? Caroline. Caroline. I guess you're the man I want to talk to, seeing you're the marshal now. I'm the marshal alright, but I got no business for you Doc. There's nobody sick around here. Not yet anyhow. - I want to see Del Stewart. - He's not seeing visitors. - Not tonight. - I'm here on official business. The law requires a medical examination for a man before he can be hanged. That's the first I heard about it. You're kind of new at this job. If you want to go over and... wake my nephew, the judge and ask him, your privilege, of course. Well. Alright, come on. - Hi you Doc. - Hi Del. - Well, let me in. - You can see him from out here. How can I examine a man through this? - Get it over with. - Don't rush me. Would you hand me my stethoscope please Del? Lock him up. Line up. Backs to me. Keep them up. Take their guns. Keep them up. Alright, in there. Move. - You're a fool to get mixed up in this. - We'll talk about that later. Caroline, you had no right to bring her here. - She brought me. - Del, I couldn't let Owen... Oh, don't make me talk about it. Doc will drive you to Denver. See the governor, tell him Owen is sick too sick to go on being judge. Now you have to hurry. There. How are you alive still Del? He'll sleep for a while, Ought to be in pretty fair shape when he wakes. - Doc, what are we going to do? - You stop worrying. With what I got to show the governor, he'll straighten things out, he'll have to. Alright Jericho, I'm ready to get going. You ain't going to Denver Doc, nobody is. They got the bridge blocked. Judge, we found Mrs. Devereaux's buggy. - No sign of them? - Can't get nobody to talk. But they're around here sure. Former marshal Del Stewart escaped from jail last night. We know he's hiding here, some of you know where he is. So the sooner you turn him over to us, the better it'll be for you. Come on, speak up, where is he? This is a warning. Unless Del Stewart is given up before 7 o'clock tonight... all of you will have to accept full responsibility. You have until 7 o'clock. What time is it Doc? Almost 6. Come on, let's dig up some food. Judge, shouldn't you get something to eat? And get a little rest. Still plenty of time before 7 o'clock. Del, if I go back to Owen, even now maybe he'd listen to me. - You not going back to him. - I'm still his wife. You're never going back to him. Del. Owen. Owen. Well, are you satisfied now? Have you done enough damage? Burn half the town, I own property over there. Owned and so did a lot of other people. If that doesn't matter to you, why didn't you stop him? Come and tell me anyhow. Why, you are the one that told us to take orders from the judge. I tried to argue with him. Didn't even ask anybody what they might think about it. Started the worst fire this town ever had, started it deliberately. You wanted a gang of outlaws rounded up, well, there they are. I suggest you leave law enforcement to officers of the law. Law? You're not enforcing law, you're out to get the man who stole your wife. - My wife was kidnapped. - Call it that if you want to. But the whole town knows your wife ran off with your best friend. And you're out of your head about it, crazy to get even. Crazy. Caroline. Caroline. Drop your gun Owen, there's been enough killing. If you won't finish him, I will. Owen. - Good bye Marshal. - Have a good trip Del. - Thanks. - You get us some action now. We'll stay in Washington until we do York. Just tell them all we want is our rights marshal, we'll take it from there. - Goodbye Doc. - Goodbye boy. - Good luck Del. - Thanks Caroline. All aboard. I'll be back soon. - Goodbye. - Goodbye.
