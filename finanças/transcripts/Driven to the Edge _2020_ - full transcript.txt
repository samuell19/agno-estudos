-Ooh. -Fun. God, it's so hot in here. Mm. In more ways than one. Oh! Hey. What the hell was that about? Hey! -Hey, look at me! Hey, hey, forget about it. You should worry about me. Why should I worry about you? 'Cause I'm dangerous. -Really? -Really. Okay. Good. Oh, wow. I've never been up here before. Hey, wrong turn. Are you listening to me? You're going the wrong way. Hey, hey, slow down. Come on. -You got to be kidding me. - Out. Now. Hey! Open up! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, back up, back up, back up. Oh, you live here? -Yeah. -Oh, my. This place is lit! Oh, my God. Oh... Huh. Lights. Dimmer. Sick. Music. Can I take a look around? Have at it. Dimmer. Yeah. I'm sorry. Here. Later. Lights. Get out of my h... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Relax, relax! Oh, my God! Oh, God! -Hi! -Good morning, Mrs. Montgomery. It's good to see you. -I adore that top on you. -Oh, thank you. Can I get you anything? How about a cappuccino? I'd love one, thank you. It's gorgeous, Tess. I love it. Oh, good. Oh. I met a guy! Cool. You don't seem impressed. -Am I supposed to be? -Yeah. No app this time. I just met a guy. -In real life? -In the flesh! -What? -Can you believe it? -How'd you meet him? -Roller. You mean, like, he was another passenger? -No. He was my driver. -Really? Yeah, really. I mean, w-what's wrong with that? No. I didn't say anything was wrong. I just want you to be safe, seems like you don't know anything about this guy. No, but what's there to know? Like, I've already put my whole life in his hands. I was in his car, he had the perfect opportunity to kill me, and he didn't. Wow. You're right. He sounds perfect. He is. Oh, my God, okay, bye. Uh! -Love you. -I love you. I think this is mine. -Excuse me? -I think the car is mine. Yeah. Tito. -Tito, the driver. -Oh. Yup. My ride got canceled. -Hate it when that happens. -Oh... -Well, which way are you going? -Uh, I have a meeting downtown. I'm headed that way. Do you want a ride? No. No, no, that's okay. Thank you, though. -You sure? -Yeah, I'm sure. Good luck. You really don't mind? 'Cause I am in kind of a hurry. No. Come on. Slight change of plans. We're gonna make a quick stop. -I'll tip you extra. -Oh, no, no, no, I'll tip him. No. My ride. My rules. -That okay with you, Tito? - Mm-hmm. Perfect. -Meet my new friend... -Tess. Tess, I'm Jaye. -Nice to meet you, Jaye. -It's nice to meet you. I'm curious about what kind of portfolio you got there. Oh. Any guesses? Let me see. Something to do with fashion? Whoa, I'm impressed. -I was right? -Yeah. -Can I take a look? -Yeah. They're beautiful. I'm amazed by people who can be so creative. I sell real estate for a living, so... Well, what's wrong with that? I hope it's for, like, I don't know, unpaid parking tickets and not, you know, murder or something. Yeah. Um, you know what, I-I actually, I don't have that far to go, so I think I'm just gonna walk. -Oh, me, too. -Okay. Doesn't Roller do background checks? Supposedly, but that doesn't stop somebody from impersonating a driver, like what happened in Boston. What happened in Boston? Somebody pretending to be a driver killed three people. -Are you serious? -Yes! Don't you watch Dateline? Um, okay. Yeah, this is, this is where my meeting is. -Knock 'em dead. -Thank you. Okay, see ya. Tess? I know we're a-adults and all, and for some reason we're not supposed to randomly make new friends, but, um... would you like to be my friend? Yeah, sure. Yeah. -Cool. All right, bye. -Bye. Good luck. Come on. Don't you remember me? You know this is the third time I've picked you up, Tess. You really should pay attention once in a while. I could be some kind of sick maniac. But it's not just you. Everyone is so trusting nowadays. Most riders barely even notice me. But I notice everything about them. Everyone is so careless with their secrets. I feel so close to you, even though we barely even know each other. But that's all about to change. I've got a lot planned for us, Tess. Buckle up. Lights. Can I take a look around? Have at it. Lights. Get out of my h... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Relax, relax! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Help! Oh, my God! Ah! No! Stop, please! No! Ah... Finally. Jolly Jane. Jane is jolly. Smile. Smile big even when you don't feel like it. Practice every day. Smiling can actually trick your brain. The facial muscles you use when you're smiling make you feel happy. It's good for you... like talking to yourself. Talking to yourself can make you a good conversationalist. Talking to yourself makes you a better conversationalist. And it keeps you company. Not to mention, it can keep you company. Just remember, you're only crazy if somebody talks back to you. ...someone talking back to you. Jolly Jane. Jane, Jane. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Oh, man, I have not done this in forever. -When was the last time? -Geez, not since I was a kid. I mean, I played in middle school, but I kinda lost interest in high school, and now I kind of suck. -What was your position? -Pitcher. -Ah, I was a catcher. -Wow. You are braver than me. Being a catcher always scared me. Girls sliding into home, their cleats out. It must've been pretty tough. Yeah, well, my dad kinda made me do it. He was all about being tough. My dad was the complete opposite. Oh, yeah? Not so tough? No, uh... Well, my parents adopted me when I was really little, you know, and they were older, so I think they thought they missed their chance to have kids or something, so... They took it pretty easy on me. So where are they now? Uh, they passed away, actually. -I'm sorry. - Yeah. Mine, too. - Really? -Yeah. It's kind of weird not having parents anymore, right? Yeah. Like you don't have roots. I get really lonely if I think about it too much, you know? Most people just don't understand. I do. Hey. -You're up. -Cool. Wow. This thing looks well loved. Yeah. My dad gave it to me. Always reminds me of him. So you took a Roller here. Do you not drive? -I'm between vehicles. -Oh. No, uh... I'm actually in no rush to get a new car. I used to be so against ride-share apps. How come? Ugh, it's a long boring story. But I guess I've seen the light, you know? No car payments, no maintenance, no parking, no insurance. -Works for me. -Yeah, makes sense. -Okay. -Okay. Let's do this. Yeah! You're good... - Softball? -Yes. -Are you jealous? -Um, of course I'm jealous. We've never done anything athletic together. Okay, well, then let's start. How about racquetball? How about drinks, instead? Yeah, okay, sure. I really want you to meet Isaac. -The Roller driver? -Mm-hmm. And invite your new friend if you want. I wanna size her up. I think you'll like her. For Steve? Yes. For Steve. Okay. Thank you. What the hell? Give me my phone. I said, give me my phone. Stop it. This isn't funny. Slow down. Why'd you get into my car, Steve? I don't even have the app open. I actually had other plans tonight, but you just assumed that I was your driver, and here we are. Pretty careless, don't you think? I mean, come on, whatever comes next, it's got to be your fault, isn't it? And now you're pondering what your next move is. Do you attack me? Maybe you could take me. I mean, I'm just a girl, right? But I seem unpredictable. You know what I think you'll do? Nothing. That's what they all do. Because even now you truly believe that I'm gonna let you go. Please... Let me go. I, I can give you money. I-I won't, I won't tell anyone. Oh, yes? -Olive! Hi. -Exac... Tess! -Hey, hi. Mwah. -Mwah. -Tess, this is Isaac. -Hi, Isaac. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Oh? Good things, I hope? -Uh, no. -Hey! -Hey, guys, -Guys, this is my friend Jaye. Hi. Oh, my gosh, thank you so much for coming. -Oh, yeah, thanks. -Hi, I'm, I'm Isaac. Hi, nice to meet you, Isaac. -Have we met before? -No. I don't think so. Hey, you look familiar. Have I seen you around somewhere? Maybe you just gave her a ride or something. -Oh, you're on Roller? -Yeah, I just got out of one. -Oh, nice. -Smelled kinda funky, actually. -Yikes. -No. See, they always blame the driver, but most times it was, like, the last rider's fault. Okay, so then the cops pull us over and they arrest our driver. -What for? -We don't know. They wouldn't tell us anything. What about you two, how did you meet? -Yup. -Uh, we also met through Roller. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah, I, I picked her up. And then I picked her up. Why, you make it sound so sleazy. It was really cute. It was so cute, so I'm talking a lot like my mouth is running, and, uh, I'm checking her out in the rearview mirror, and then she was like, "Oh, my God! Look out!" 'cause I almost rear-ended the guy in front of me. Because he was so enamored by me, right? -Still am. -Hm. It's crazy how much trust we put into strangers these days, isn't it? I mean, she didn't know you. You could have been anybody. And she just got in your car alone, defenseless. I mean, anything could have happened. Whoo, you took that in a dark direction. But you used to say the same thing. But I mean, it makes sense 'cause with everything that you went through and stuff... -Hm. -What does she mean? I had my identity stolen a couple of years ago. And it was really, uh, invasive. And the person who was doing it would send me all these weird emails, like taunting me. -Oh,... -Yeah. So I didn't really trust anybody after that. I wrote off all apps and basically all technology that I didn't absolutely have to use. -Wait, w-w-wait, guys. -What? I have a brilliant idea. Okay. So, like, the four of us met through Roller, right? What if there was, like, a-a ride-share app that was also a dating app? Yeah, personally I like it. - Yeah? -Mm-hmm. Okay, well, you wanna invest? Okay. You wanna invest? Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Yo, J! -OJ? -No, no, no. I said, yo, J! You're funny. Uh, I finally figured it out. -Figured what out? -Where I remember you from. Uh, I was getting my vehicle inspection for Roller and you were there getting one, too. One what? Um, a vehicle inspection. Look, I don't know why you're trying to keep this all a secret. You and, you and Tess are just... You're friends, right? It's not, you're not like a couple? I mean, maybe, maybe you want her to think that you're more successful than you are or something, I don't know, but, I, she seems really chill. I don't, I don't think she would care. But I know, it's not my place. It wasn't me, Isaac. You're mistaken. Well, if that is the truth, uh, then you better look out 'cause, 'cause you got an evil twin running around out there. What makes you think I'm not the evil one? What, what? You just assumed I'm the good one. But what if I'm the evil twin? Just call me Jolly Jane. Then you better look out... 'cause you got an evil twin running around out there. I'm the bad one, you're the good one. I'm the bad one, you're the good one. I'm the bad one, you're the good one. I'm the good one, you're the bad one. Livinia. It's a pretty name. Livinia. You know, we're basically neighbors 'cause I, I live right around the corner. Is this the right place? -Door's stuck. -Is it? Yeah, do you have child locks on? No. Hold on. Ow! Ow! Ow... Hey, hey, hey, hey, relax. Wait. Wa-wa-wait. What? Wait, Jaye? You know, I'm pretty hard on most riders. It's like what we were talking about last night. And why do people put their trust in complete strangers? I don't trust you, Isaac. I mean... -Look at what you're wearing. -What's wrong with my shirt? And you definitely shouldn't trust me. But it goes both ways. I mean, most drivers are just as stupid. We don't know who's sitting behind us. We don't know where we're going. The smart ones, they have weapons. -But you don't, do you, Isaac? -No. You don't even have a dash cam. I love my dash cam. The sunglasses cam is pretty good, too. Wait, wait, no, no, no! Wait, no, no, no! Ow! Ah! Ow! God! -Oh. Hey, Jaye. -Hey, what are you doing? I am making a dress. -What are you up to? -Mm. I'm just finishing a quick lunch before I show some houses. Wow, look at us. We're such busy professionals. Are you still there? Yeah. Hey, do you wanna come over tonight? Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. Can I bring anything? No, I got it covered. My client is here, so I gotta go. I'll text you my address, okay? Okay, cool. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Bye. Uh, smells like disgusting fast food in here. Did you know Nannie Doss killed four of her five husbands? They called her The Lonely Hearts Killer. You have any idea why she didn't kill that fifth guy? I have my theories. Aren't we going the wrong way? I don't know. I don't know where you're going. Isn't the address in the app? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have picked you up. I'm tired and I, I really don't have time for this right now. I just couldn't help myself, I just had to see, you know, if you were dumb enough to get in the car, like that last one, Steve. And guess what? You're just as dumb as Steve. I'm calling the cops. Works every time. Help! Help me, somebody! My passenger has gone crazy! Somebody! Jaye? Hello? -You made it. -Oh, jeez, you scared me. Thank you. -Welcome. -Uh, this place is insane. How long have you lived here? How long have I lived here? Um, I guess about two years. Do you have roommates? I think what you're trying to ask is how I can afford to live here. -Maybe. -Fair question. I have clients over a lot, so gotta have a decent place for, you know... -Your image? -Yeah. A lot of agents rent bus stops. This is like my bus stop. -You hungry? -Yeah. Mm. So what made you get into fashion? I think I've always just felt I need to dress-up. -Mm. -And decided to make my own. Kind of bored with what was out there. Okay, let's see what you got here... That's cute. Oh, you have a lot of power suits. - Uh, yuck. - I like this one. -Put that on with this guy. -Oh. Yeah. -Put this guy. Okay -Okay. -Now what about you? -Me... Let's see, let's see. Whoa! What's this? -Mm-hmm. -This is amazing. This is mine. Dibs. I'm wearing it. Oh, man. You know, I-I have to say, I think this is some of the best wine I've ever had. You should take a few bottles. I've got tons. No, I'm not gonna take your wine. If you like something, you should take it. That's what I do. Oh. Oh! It's Olive. She keeps trying to talk to me about Isaac, but honestly, I really just can't deal with it right now. -So just ignore her. -Yeah, but then I feel guilty. Hm, that's something I've never felt before. -That's hard to believe. -It's true. You've never feel guilty about anything in your life? What's the point? I mean, I-I could feel bad about the slave labor that goes into making my cell phone. But I like my cell phone, so I-I don't really care. Do you? Yeah. I don't love the idea of slave labor. Ah, but I mean, we all do it. Look at us. We're sitting here in the richest country in the world drinking a bottle of wine that cost more than some people make in a whole month. I-is it fair? Of course not. But do I care? Not even a little bit. What about you? Do you care? Yeah. What? Yeah, of course I care that things aren't fair. -Really? -Yes. Good. I like to push people's buttons when I drink. You know, spice things up. Oh. Whoa. Olive's calling me, and she never does that. I'll be back. -Hey. - Hey, um... Isaac's been radio silent all day. No big deal, right? Even though he's never played the I'll-wait-two-days- to-text-you-back game. And we're supposed to hang out tonight, and I still haven't heard back from him, so it just kinda makes sense. -I'm kind of freaking out, r-- -Whoa, slow down. When's the last time you heard from him? Like, yesterday? This morning. Okay, Olive, you need to relax. -I'm sure he's fine. - You're sure? How can you be so sure of that? Just take a deep breath and try not to worry. Have I just been moving too fast with this whole thing? Um... I, I don't know, I don't know. I don't think so. You do think so, otherwise you'd have just said no. -Olive. -You're right, I'm sorry. What are you doing? I am at Jaye's house. Okay. I'll let you go then. Okay, well, let me know when you hear from him, and, you know, just try to stay calm, okay? Yeah, I'm so calm. Have fun. All right, bye. Is Isaac ghosting her? Hardly. She hasn't heard from him since this morning. And she's, of course, already assuming the worst. -That he's dead? -God, no! That he's ignoring her. Which I mean, maybe he is. She barely knows the dude. Do you wanna crash here? We could watch movies, tell secrets and, obviously, drink more wine. Mm, uh, yeah, maybe. Keeping your options open. Smart girl. I work my off during the day and this is how you repay me? What must their parents think? Why are you doing this? Livinia Fisher. She was the first female serial killer in the United States. This was in the 1800s. Livinia and her husband ran an inn together. She would give her guests cups of poisoned tea. Most of them just went up to their room and died. But some of them who weren't all the way dead, her husband finished them off. I think it's nice that they had a common interest. Some couples play golf, some play cards. Livinia and her husband just happened to both enjoy killing people. I'd like a partner. Not a man. More like a friend. -Who are you? -Who are you? Myles. Jaye's husband. Soon to be ex-husband. I'm Tess. Jaye's not here. Where is she, Tess? Showing a house. Showing a house? Yeah, she's showing a house to some clients. Why are you lying to me? I'm not. Well, Jaye doesn't sell real estate. She didn't do anything. Look, I don't know what's going on between the two of you and I don't care. Just tell her to quit ignoring my calls. Danny. Hey there. Hey, Tess, how are you? I'm good. How about you? -It's been a minute. -Yeah, well, let's fix that. I'm in town for a couple of days. I wanna see you. Still no word? -I'm sorry, Olive. -Yeah. Me, too. -Did you text him again? -Yeah. Totally. Hey, uh, so there's something I haven't told you. Uh, remember the other night how Isaac said that he recognized Jaye? -Yeah, kinda. -Okay. Well, apparently, he saw Jaye getting a vehicle inspection for Roller. An inspection? Like, to drive for them? -Yeah. Why would you say that? -I seriously doubt that. Because you should see her house. The girl's got money. Yeah, but, like, she's already lied to you about her job. -Right? -According to her ex-husband. Maybe he's the one lying. -Why would he do that? -I don't know. I don't know why either one of them would lie about any of this. I don't know, this whole thing's weird. And also if Jaye's on social media, I can't find her. -You checked? -Yeah. I mean, you? No. I only do that with guys. -Oh, speaking of... -What? -Danny's in town. -Ooh, Ken Doll Danny. Well, that's not how I have him saved in my contacts, but, yes, that Danny. Are you gonna have sex with him? Yes, thanks for asking, I do think I'm going to have sex with him. Amazing... -Hey. - Hey. -How was your day? -It was fine. Sorry about disappearing on you earlier. No. No, no problem. Hey, uh, how did it go with your clients? Ugh, they have so much money, but they're impossible to please. Mm. I hear that. Actually, uh, yeah, somebody stopped by to see you. -Oh. Who? -Myles. -Oh. -Yeah. He said you don't sell real estate. He did? Have you ever driven for Roller? Have you ever driven for Roller? Um, no. Why? Because Isaac told Olive that you did. Well, Isaac's wrong. I don't know. Listen, I have to get back to work, okay? Okay. Hello. Hm. How's your cell signal? -Not good all of a sudden. -Yeah, imagine that. -Jaye? -You caught me. ..., so Isaac was right. -Who's Myles? -What? Tess said she met someone named Myles. Like that was supposed to mean something to me. Well, yeah. Isn't he your ex-husband? Oh. Yeah, she was married. Like Livinia and Nannie. I should have known that one. I don't really get it. Is he your ex or not? Apparently. It's not like I do a lot of research when I choose somebody. Okay, pull over. I want to get out. Ahem. Say hi. You're on camera. Okay, come on, come on. I-I said to pull over. Did you know that Isaac doesn't have a dash cam? I mean, can you believe that? It's the best part of this job. -How do you know that? -How do I know what? Yeah, I'm calling the police. You know what's almost as cool as the camera is this thing right here. Do you know what it is? Cell-phone jammer. It's sort of legal, sort of not. It's like a grey area. I can't believe it took me so long to pick one up. Oh, yeah. Child locks. Now's about the time that they start screaming for help, but if we could just skip that tonight... -I've got kind of a headache. -Come on. J-just pull it, just pull over, okay? Like, I-Isaac's waiting for me and I-- I'm taking you to Isaac. No, but we're going the wrong way. He's not at home. What do you mean? Where is he? Just sit-sit back, relax. Enjoy the ride. Would you like a bottle of water? Hey, where's Isaac? Oh, he's around here somewhere. What did you do to him? You can go now. I just need your phone first. -And your passcode? -What? Do you want to get out of this car? Okay, okay. 7-7-7-7. You're kidding. You're not kidding. Can you just let me out of here? Isaac? Isaac? - Hello? -Isaac! Is anybody there? Please! Help me! Please, please, please don't hurt me anymore. Please. No! Help! Help! No. No. No. No! Hey, Myles. Jane Toppan was a nurse. They called her Jolly Jane. She killed over 30 of her own patients. Her favorite thing to do was to sit with them... when they were dying, watching their eyes, imagining how they were feeling, what they were seeing as they slipped away. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Jaye? Oh... Oh, boy. Hey. -Hey, Tess. -So you do drive for Roller. This is awkward. Yeah. Tess, wait. What's wrong? I owe you an apology. Really, Tess. I-I'm-I'm sorry. You know what, you don't have to do this right now. Yeah. I do. I lied to you. I mean, obviously, I, I drive for Roller. And I lied about being a real-estate agent, too. I'm sort of a part-time assistant to an agent hoping to get my license someday soon. I was in a really bad marriage, and I'm trying to get out of it, but it's not easy. Myles has me locked out of all the bank accounts. It'll get sorted out in court, but for now I have to make all the cash I can. But why wouldn't you just tell me all of this? I know. I should have. But you were just so fun to be with, and I guess I was trying to be who I wanted to be and not who I am 'cause who I am is kind of a mess right now. Well, um... let me at least get you guys where you're going. -Yeah, okay. - You both look great. By the way. Oh, um, um, Jaye? -Yeah? -You passed where we're going. Jaye? Oh. Sorry. I'm a little distracted up here. Oh, look at me. Not exactly five-star service, huh? Hang in there. "Hang in there?" Oh, my God. Oh, um, um, Jaye? -Yeah? -You passed where we're going. Jaye? Oh. Sorry. I'm a little distracted up here. Oh, look at me. Not exactly five-star service, huh? All of these women who came before you, what did they have in common? Besides the killings, they all got caught. And you're gonna get caught, too, unless you get out of here. Even if you do get out of here, it's only a matter of time. But that's what the videos are for. Your legacy. Mornin'. Morning. So how'd it go with Tess? You seal the deal? What is this? I know. What a coincidence, right? You get into my car again? No, this is a different car. Yeah, variety. Spice of life. Were you just waiting outside Tess's place to pick me up? That's it, isn't it? You just wait there hoping I call for a ride, then you get first dibs on me because you're right there. No. That's not what just happened. That's what I did yesterday. Are you serious? No, I'm kidding. Of course I'm serious, you dum-dum. ... You're a stalker. Serial killer. Though stalking is admittedly part of the gig. You ever heard of Dorothea Puente? All right. You had your fun. Pull the car over. -Nah. -I said, pull the car over. And I said "Nah." You know Isaac called me OJ. Do you want me to call the cops? Uh, yeah, sure. Deal. All right. No signal? Don't you hate when that happens? Who's your provider? Are you on an unlimited plan? ...! Pull over the car! Hey! Are you hearing me? Pull over the car! Pull... -Hey. - Hey. -Thanks for answering. -Yeah, yeah, no problem. I know this is awkward, but I was hoping that we could still be friends. Yeah, of course. It's not that big of a deal, Jaye. And I was wondering if you wanted to come over for drinks tonight. Oh, um, you know what, I'm-I'm actually, I'm super busy with work. No pressure. I just wanted to see you before I go out of town. -Where are you going? -Long story. Well, we'll be here if you change your mind. "We?" Isaac and Olive are coming over. Oh? That's cool. Yeah, they're supes cool. O-okay. Well, um, yeah, I'll let you know how I'm doing with work and I'll just text you. Tight. Okay, bye. Bye. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Jolly Jane. Tess, sorry to keep you waiting. Thanks for coming. It means a lot to me. Oh. Yeah, of course. Thanks for inviting me. -Wine? -Yes, please. Oh. Um, are Olive and Isaac here? Oh, they're on their way. So how was your ride? Uh, it was fine. Pretty uneventful. How many stars did you give your driver? -Oh, I never do that. -Tess, come on. It's part of the whole deal. We're all out there hustling for those five stars. Uh, yeah, I don't know, it just... I don't like the idea that I'm supposed to do something other than just pay for my ride. -It takes like one second. -Well... What if I don't have a second to spare? I mean, who looks at those ratings anyway? What's your rider rating? -Oh, I have no clue. -Let me see. Okay. Oh, Tess. -Three point three? -Is that bad? I can't believe you're even getting any rides with a number that low. Whatever, I don't know who would give me less than five stars. It's not like I've ever thrown up in a car or something. Hope not. That's unacceptable. Well, then why do I have such a low number? Mm... Do you ever make your driver wait? Like he gets there and you're not ready yet? Not really. Do you ever get into a car with your headphones on? -What's wrong with that? -Some drivers think it's rude. -I have to admit I did. -Did what? I thought it was kind of rude when you got into my car with headphones on. I sort of picked you up once or twice before we officially met. Once or twice? And you're just now telling me this? Excuse me. Bathroom. Yeah, okay, pull over, I want to get out. Say hi. You're on camera. Okay, come on, come on. I-I said to pull over. Did you know that Isaac doesn't have a dash cam? -Can you believe that? -Ah! Sorry about that. I would suggest you don't do anything rash. I've seen it all before. What did you do to Olive? I'm taking you to her right now. Where? You'll see. This is my last ride. As Jaye, I mean. It's time for me to move on to a new city. So this... This is what you do? Yeah. This is what I do. I was on the East Coast, and I needed to make some money. So I thought I'd start driving for Roller. My very first night driving, I had a passenger attack me. Didn't go so well for that guy. But it did make me realize that I could use this whole ride-share revolution to pursue my own interests. Who are you? You don't know? I'm Jaye. And before Jaye I was Charlotte. Before Charlotte I was Stella. But that was all just practice. Getting me ready... to come back home. -Where are we? -This is where I grew up. I still own it, though as you can see, I haven't exactly kept the place up. So what now? Olive's inside. Try to run back. Why should I believe you? I could have easily killed you at Jaye's house. That's not what this is about, Tess. I swear. Olive? Olive? Olive? - Tess? Tess, help me! -Olive! -Olive? - Yeah. -I'm in here. -Oh, my God, Olive. Can you help me, please? God... -Hey, hey, hey. -Oh, my God. It's okay, all right? It's gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay, okay? Hurry. -She's crazy. -I know. She killed Isaac. -What? -She killed Isaac! -Isaac's dead? -Yes. Oh, my... Okay, okay, it's gonna be okay. -Okay. -Keep them tight. Tell you what, I'll let you go, but there's a price to pay. Okay, anything. If I let you go, Tess has to die. Is that okay with you? -What? - Yes. So you're okay with me killing Tess? -As long as I let you go? Yes. Yes. Just do whatever, okay? We're-we're not even, like, friends anymore, so just, just let me go, okay? Please! Can you believe that, Tess? That's your best friend. She sold you out just to save her own ass. Because you hurt her. You killed her boyfriend. Yeah, I've killed a lot of people. What do you think the smell from the garage is? But even I wouldn't kill my best friend. I-I didn't mean it. Yeah, she did. But, Tess, I don't want to kill you, not at all. I wanna help you. -Then just let us go. -That's not helping you. I want you to know what it feels like to have real power. I want you to kill her. I know, I know it sounds crazy. It sounded crazy to me at first, too. You will tell them he was hurting mommy. -Do you understand me? -Okay. Nobody's gonna blame you. You're just a little girl trying to protect her mother. -Hm. -You'll be a hero. Okay, I'm gonna go. I shouldn't be here when it happens. -Okay? -Okay. I love you, Cindy. I didn't wanna do it. Even though he could be so mean and even though he hurt her, he was still my dad. And I thought it would feel horrible... but it didn't feel horrible. It didn't feel horrible at all. It was the best feeling I had ever felt in my life. I finally didn't feel afraid. I felt so powerful. Why? Why are you telling me this? You still don't know? It's okay, Tess. Everything's okay now. But it wasn't okay. They blamed mom and they separated us. -No. -Yes. -We're sisters. -No... I couldn't protect you then, but I can now. I want you to know what it feels like to have real power so that you never have to feel like a victim ever again. Just kill her. Come on, Tess, it'll be fun. Oh. I-I can't. I can't trust you with the bat yet. I don't know, just strangle the bitch or something. -No, Tess, Tess, don't-- - Shut up. Come on. Okay, okay, okay. Come on. Come on, come on. Let's go. Okay. Come on. Whoa, whoa. Help! Help us! Help! Stop. Yeah, what is it? What's wrong? Oh, my God, what happened? Can you call someone, please? -What happened? -Please, please, just please. How we doing tonight? Doing well, I see. I'll get you two where you're going safe and sound. My name's Tess.
