A young man loves a maiden Who chooses another instead; This other loves still another And these two haply wed. The maiden out of anger Marries, with no regard, the first good man she runs into - The young lad takes it hard. It is so old a story, Yet somehow always new; And he that just lived it, It breaks his heart in two. I could not be this happy anywhere else. Look, there's none of this fashion crap or anonymity, kids can't even get an internet connection in school. I just love this ordinariness. Then I know what it is you love about Eric. And I know that he's never been loved like this. Oh folks. At least when you're with him. And Marty. Let's toast on you two. Cheers! So this is how you party? Is this your way to party? Don't mess around, Basti! Beer! Beer! Beer! If I knew how much you'd drink, I would've gotten you one, too. It's the booze. You know, that's not true. I love you! I love you, too! What the hell is wrong with you? You are not sane, man! Not sane? That's what this bitch said, too., Not sane.” You wanna know how sane I am? It's your brother. Come on, Basti. - Come on. Time to go. - Need any help? No. It's alright. Stay here. Three years later Letting someone go is never easy. And the one who left does not feel this farewell's sorrow. It's the bereaved of a young and clear soul like Sebastian's who do now have to suffer this sudden loss. Nevertheless does this farewell represent the birth of our most valuable memories. And it's our memories that can not be taken away from us. The day will come when we have to leave as well - despite all sorrow. But all our loved ones won't die away from us but into our souls. Even if Sebastian did not live long enough to have a family on his own, he will stay in the souls of his bereaved as a loving son and brother. Today, his brother Eric was caring enough to bring one of Basti's favorite records. Sebastian, we are pretty sure, this is something, you may have liked. Already seen it. The storm won't come until tomorrow. Your mother. - What's on her mind? - I don't know. You'll have to put in the horses today. I know. I saw in the newspapers, that the Schlemiehl boy died. Basti. Just wanted to know, if you heard about it. I did. And you didn't say a word? No mum, I didn't. Should I give Eric a call? No. - Did you? - No, I didn't. You're just like your father. Keeping silent, avoiding struggle. He's a fine boy. You could at least take responsibility for the way things are right now. - And now take your salad. Tomatoes and onions. Just how you like it. - Thanks. - And don't forget about the horses. - I won't. Did you talk to your mother? She just wanted a nice farewell for him. She had nothing to do with Basti for the last few years. We both know who looked for him and took all his shit. - It's still her son. - Achim, come on. Look around. This church thing is ridiculous. - Ridiculous? - Yeah. I know how difficult he was. But you need to pull yourself together. - They look at me like I'm the bad one. - Then don't act like it. Come on. Just let someone kill you and everyone thinks of you as a fucking saint. Eric. It's not just good and bad out there. And everyone forgets what a jerk you were. Have you been in contact with Marty? Listen, Achim. I gotta go. See you. So are we going out tonight? You can sleep at my place. I'll sleep at home. You don't get it. I do. You live in Hillybillytown by choice and sit in your car for 2 hours every day. - I grew up there. I know you won't get it...- -I'm from Neuruppin which is not Brooklyn as well. Or is Sir Lancelot jumping from his tractor today to impregnate you with his shiny dick? What? Alright. Just leave and have a good time. I'll stay a little longer. Okay. Just think about your life. And don't drive home too late. Otherwise you get home and you're 30. 40. 50. 85. Dead. - What did you and Achim talk about? - Basti. Good. Evil. Tomatoes. What the fuck. Well, what are you? What are you? Are you good? Are you evil? Keys. Come on, car. - Hey. - Hey. - You been busy? - How about you? I missed you. I'm going to uni tomorrow. Dad said there's going to be a storm tomorrow. - I can't take it. - What are you doing? What's happening? Yeah? Hey. Hey Marty. It's me. - What's wrong? - Man, hearing your voice is rad. Do you know, where I've been today? Yes. I feel like nothing's ever changing. No matter if we're here or not. What do you think? It's Sunday tomorrow. I'll pick you up like in the old days? Marti? Are you there? Yes. I'll pick you up at five? No. That won't work. It's okay. I'll be there at five. Marti. Listen, kid. We're not hurting these trees. Look. You can't see it, but they're already dead. And it's not sad to cut dead trees, is it? You're a fish. Good morning. A CLEAR FELLING I like what you did with the house. Happened a lot. Good to see you. You too. - How did you catch'em? - It's uncle Achim's spot. You can fish here, too. I'm Eric. Fuck. - I'll take a piss. - Alright. - No beer? - Soon. Don't you get it? It's funny. - I don't see any use in poetry. - You just don't get it. It's not entertaining. Nor thrilling. Nor relaxing. Poetry just exists.- - There's my man. - Like cats. Can you pay your brother's tab? Sure. Sorry. - Bocki, you made it. - Right. I never thought I'd lounge like this. Well. One of us had to get somewhere. What do you drink? - Bocki! I'll take a large beer. - No problem. No kiss? How "bout me?" Sweet pleasure is a giddy girl, And loves in no place long to stay; From off your brows she'll brush a curl, And kiss you quick and flit away. Dame sorrow, scornful of all flurry, Herself to your embrace commits; She says she's in no kind of hurry, And on your bed sits down and knits. It's good. Isn't it? Won't work? What's the trouble? Stop it, Basti. Basti. Please stop. Basti. Just stop this- Give me a sec. Are you okay? Don't. Just don't. Hello.- I can't take it. Hey. What's wrong? Can I stay here for a few days. What about Eric? Is it okay if I don't tell you anything? Sure. I'm sorry you lost your brother. I thought you'd give me a call or something. I thought you wouldn't care about my pity. Pity? Would've cost you guts. I would have cared about those. But it's okay, I guess. Is there anything they found out about his death? You know how things are. The police men knew about Basti. So why would anyone care? By the way, I am very grateful you took her in. It's what really good friends do, I guess. And who could've known, she'd never move out.- -Eric. She called me. Two weeks ago. After a year? Or more? So? So we met. - Met? - Met. And she told me this lovely little story. I'm not here to change my mind. What did I do wrong? Nothing. I'm so sorry but I just couldn't tell you.- -Tell me what? I just need to know why we're not together. You just left. Is he nice to you? Martin? Is he treating you good? You know him. It's your brother. - What about him? - He looks like you. Always. But we're not really that similar. Talk to me. What's wrong? What am I for you? Everything. What did Basti do? Frenni, what did he do? Do you remember, when I packed my stuff and- -Of course I remember. - I went to Martin and... - I know. I just didn't realize it wasn't you. Stand up, Basti. Come on- -She didn't do a thing. She just... ...let me fuck her. - Come on. Stand up. - Don't mourn, brother. A woman like Frenni... ...does not deserve guys like us. - I'm nothing like you, Basti. - No. You... You're just too dull for Frenni. What would you do, if someone hurt you like that? What to do? If someone is just plain bad. I don't know how many times I asked myself this question. So you just killed him? Wherever I am, I'm surrounded by a darkness so gloomy and dense that the light of your eyes, dearest, no longer sparkles before me. Extinct for me is the golden splendour of the sweet stars of love. An abyss gapes at my feet. Welcome me, ancient night. That's Heine. I know. - I'll get some cigarettes. - No no no no. Marty, maybe you know that there are things happening that you can't control. And suddenly you realize what you've done. And what it means. I won't hurt you, okay? Why are we here then? Martin! - This stupid feather... - ...Just leave it the fuck alone. What? This stupid feather? What's the matter with you? -I'M Eric and the whole world's against me.” The fuck are you whining about? It's a pisser of a day. Pisser of a day? Everyday's a pisser like this. And I guess there's nothing you'd like to change about it. And why don't you leave this place? Set up a mattress in the back and a nice little kitchen. Just like the hippies. And then you travel the world. , Eric visits Kuala Lumpur.“ And I tell you something: In the end you'll be back home telling me, Well Speiche, life's best in Mecklenburg.” Believe me. And maybe it's not. Is it the right one? Mom's paid your open bills. Clean the table. We're eating. It's too bad with Frenni, isn't it? Eat. Fuck. Marty. Temperature's rising. After quite a nippy morning the sun finally seems to come back. (Saxon German) Isn't this beautiful? (Saxon German) Too right! Even the weather plays along. Did Axel write anything? - The kids been in the water. - No way. - And there was even space to park. - Well, well. Aren't these the cutest in the world? I'm so proud of them. And of you, too, my honey melon. No no no no no. Please don't. - Hello? - Hello? - Yeah. Hi. - Who am I talking to? - You called. - Why so informal? Well, I'm... ...I apologize. Accepted. Now could you please tell me who I'm talking to? - Maybe you should know that since you are calling me. - But you gave me your number today. You wrote it on a serviette but excluded the name. I must have thought something about it. What you should immediately know is that the ominous stranger thing won't wash with me. - Maybe I just wanted to have a nice little chat. - Oh, I see... Well then... You just struck me. That's brisk. - What should I say? You just struck me. - Don't you think that's clumsy? - Beg your pardon? - Oh sorry, I was talking to someone else. I somehow lost overview on all the phone numbers I handed out today. - Ever thought about business cards? - Pardon? Because you're handing out your number that often? You have such an incredibly sympathetic telephone voice. That is why I got to be honest with you. And I want you to know, that I gave out my number only once. Once and today? Once. And why did you? Because I fell in love with you. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this on the phone. However you like. I'm Franziska by the way. You can stop this formal speak if you like. What a sucker. You forgot about our missing plug. Where do I have my phone? - Hello? - Hello? Listen. Marty. Marty. Hey. Leave me. Look what a man you are. Come on. You're not going to bleed out. And you're ruining it all if you try to run away. (Saxon German) You can call me Werner. (Saxon German) Helga. You do know that I'm not a bad person, don't you? As my friend? But still, you're always the better one. And there's nothing wrong about that? You think that's fair? Always being the good one? I just can't get it. Why? Because your parents stuck everything up your ass? But this is not about your parents. But good things just happen to you. But not to me. That's not fair, is it? You know why I love the forest? Everything's balanced here. But with people, you and me... ...everything's fucked. Hey. Can't put a worm on a fishing hook, can't fell a tree... can't kill a fish, you can't even swat flies. Man, you've always been too weak. Weak, weak, weak. You couldn't have survived in natural world, if your dam had kicked you out of her nest in good time. But everyone kept you inside the bubble. Even uncle Achim. I'll never understand why he pampered you like this. But with me, he wanted me to become a man. That's manly? Destroying my leg? Do you remember Joe? My pup with the pale eye? Achim thought Joe couldn't see with this eye, but still he was damn attentive. What do you want? We were just biking down the road. And when we came back to the yard, uncle Achim stood there, holding Joe at the neck. I don't know how long he already stood there like this. We forgot to close the gate behind the house, so Joe got to the front. Just like that. And the big bird cage was torn- -Aviary. Yeah, right. Aviary. I remember way too much feathers in the grids. And blood. Way too much blood. And uncle Achim stood there, holding Joe, and Joe's back was also torn open. Must have happened when he crawled under the grids. Crazy mutt. And he stood there and with his other hand... ...he turned his neck. - This isn't about your stupid dog, right? - Nope. That was a lesson, Marty. Because we all have to take responsibility four our actions. Uncle Achim just kept balance. So did I. ,, And if the dead trees won't fall...“ - ...you gotta help 'em along.” - Right. Uncle Achim's words. I got nothing for free. But now you want her, too, don't you? Forever? It's all about her, isn't it? Martin, here in the forest it's all about the balance. But loneliness sucks, there you're right. Easy, boys. Slow down. You know what to do, Eric. It's okay. You didn't fight for Frenni nor did you do anything else. She just stood at your door. She made a decision. That's why you're not the only one today. Eric. You know where she is, right? University? You got the knife right there in your leg. You'd just have to take it. But you won't do anything. I know that. Come on. Pull it out. You won't ruin this! Not again! I'm not mad at you! Marty? I'll drive to Frenni now! To university! Shut the fuck up. Oh, fuck this. The plug... I can't take it. I just can't get it! I'm sorry. (Saxon German) And we're not leaving home very often. We've been living in Chemnitz all our life. That's why a vacation is so special to us. (Saxon German) But it's alright. But it's absolutely okay to settle. Absolutely. Even though I have to admit, that I would have loved to see a lot more of the world. Especially when I was young. I always found it silly how the elders kept their blinkers on. Not looking left, nor right. Haven't we all thought like this when we were younger? And sometimes you have to think how life would be going today. If everything would have went differently. And what kind of person you'd be. I don't mind. We're happy, right? Two terrific children, a charming husband, a good job. Solid. From place to place thou'rt wandering still, Thou scarcely knowest why; A gentle word the wind doth fill, Thou look'st round wond'ringly. My loved one, who was left behind, Is calling softly now: , Return, I love thee, O be kind, My only joy art thou!” But on, still on, no peace, no rest, Thou never still mayst be; What thou of yore didst love the best, Thou ne'er again shalt see. In terms of love he's just too fatalistic. That's not what he means. He isn't talking about love. He's talking about home. - And you appreciate what he says? - I do. Considering that you live in the same spot for 30 years, you're talking quite big. Doesn't have to stay this way. We can leave. We wouldn't be missed. - What bothers you about home? - It doesn't bother me. But if you're here, everything stays the same and so do you. And for someone like me that's... - Someone like you? - Yeah. The good ones stay good and the others stay the others. You classify people into good ones and others? Yep. Somehow it got difficult for me, too. I'd really like to stay but then I look at my fellow students doing their years abroad... Sometimes it's even hard to drive back home. This could answer your earlier question: There's a French author writing that even if most people do so, it is nothing but wrong to consider Heine a fundamentally bad person. His heart is as good as his tongue is bad. He is tender, mindful, devoted, a romantic and even fragile lover and a woman can control him unboundedly. And she knows all of this from his poems? They lived in the same century so maybe he hopped in bed with her. I see. He doesn't mind leaving his home behind, but this woman controls him. And since you're controlling me, I stay. (Saxon German) Hello? Coming back to earth? This is where I have to get off. I gotta go. - Got your things? - Yep. I just got get my bike. Do you remember this guy in the forest? It was our first day at the lake when we were young. And this guy sat there on the clearing, just like that and didn't move. And I remember him looking terribly sad. And weak. And back then I promised myself to never be like this. Never. What I'm saying is, I'm not the cry-baby kind of man, right? No. It's peaceful out here. I imagined this to be different. What do you mean? Dying. You won't die. I have to. Why? So you can be the bad one. That's not true. And neither is it true that everything's falling into my lap. I should have helped you more. But I didn't. Gimme your phone. It's ridiculous. Now that I'm here, I don't want to die anymore. I don't want to die, Marty. What if she still loves me? You made an emergency call. How can I help you? - Are you able to understand me? - She's so beautiful. Hello? Can I help you? - Help me. - Are you still there? A brotherly forbearance Has united us for ages: You, you tolerate my breathing And I tolerate your rages. Just a few benighted eras Found you feeling rather odd, Coloring your loving-pious Little talons with my blood. Later we became more cordial, Day by day our friendship grew - For I also started raging And I almost seem like you. Thanks for the coffee. - Seems like the storm rolled by. - Looks like it. Eric... Eric, are you alright, I...
