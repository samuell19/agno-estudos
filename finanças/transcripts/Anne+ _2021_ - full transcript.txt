Are you coming? - Where to? - [Maya] To Jip's. No, no, no, I have a really important thing with my publisher tomorrow. Well, you have plenty of time until then! - No, no. Are you all going? - Oh, baby. [speaking French] - What the hell are you doing, dude? - French. I'm gonna lose my day streak. [chuckles] Darling, Canadian French is entirely different from French French. French is French. I can't afford a fancy language class. Says the girl who just spent 70 bucks tonight on beer. [laughs] Okay, guys, to Jip's at full trot. [man] Oh, this is nice! And if I want to hear bleating, I'll buy a goat. - [bleats] - [laughs] [Anne speaking French] - [phone chimes] - [Anne] Yeah, nailed it! [speaks French] [friends cheering] THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY TITS THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD GO [Anne] You'll be on display here soon too, Anne. [publisher] So, there are some really genuinely beautiful pieces in here. Sharp ones too. But I sort of have the feeling that you lost your way a little bit. [Anne] Oh. Um... What do you... Well, what I mean is when you sent us those first chapters back then, we were truly very enthusiastic. Yeah. And we were impressed with the personal and authentic nature of it. But you've lost some of that on the way and it's, mm... Sorry, but it's a bit uninteresting. It also reads like you lost yourself some too. Is that correct? Well, uh... No, I don't think that's the case. Hmm. But the character is searching, right? Yes, I get that. Yes, and that's fine. But in its current state, we can't publish it yet. And I don't think it would hurt to make some upgrades, yes? I mean, the book is already in our catalog. I'm sorry, but, um, the searching theme is fine, right? Um, that's sort of like... um... one of the lead character's main traits. Yes, but your main character has no goal. It seems like she doesn't want to find what she's searching for. What does she want and how does she get there? And is she really the hero of the story? [Anne] What a load of bullshit. Okay... [sighs] But I... Okay. All right, I know a great writing coach. I'll put you in touch with her. And also, I think it would be helpful to ask Anne, "What do I really want to say?" Because you have some important decisions to make. So what do you, Anne Verbeek, have to tell the world? [computer chimes] Hey, lover. - [Sara] Hey, sweetie. - [background chatter] Oh, shit, our timing is really not good lately. [Sara] Oh shit! [chuckles] Hey, what time is it? Don't you have work mornings? Yeah, it's fucking early, but we landed this huge, killer contract, so we have the whole morning off. Oh, that's great. Congrats. [Sara] Thanks. By the way, I finally finished decorating our place! [Anne] Hmm. Wanna see? See? There's the little kitchen. - Oh. Oh, hi. - [Sara] And also this lamp. Remember the one from that magazine, by that Italian designer? And I said a while back that this lamp is so pricey! Oh! - [in French] Hello. - [in English] Uh, hello. [girl speaking French] [Sara speaking French] [whispers] [speaks French] [in English] Who was that? [Sara chuckles] Let me just step away so we can talk. [Anne] Okay... Okay, um... [chuckles] I originally, uh, wanted to talk about this tomorrow afternoon, uh, but... then this happened, and we're talking now, so I just want to get it off my chest. Um... I've sort of been flirting with someone. And that was her back there. Uh, Zoey. [chuckles] [Anne] Oh, fuck... That was pretty fast. [Sara] Anne? Sorry, you froze, um... Where'd you meet her? She's just someone I met through a colleague. [Anne] Nice. Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, no... she... looks nice. - Different type. - [Sara] Yeah. Hey, sweetie, are you okay? 'Cause if you're uncomfortable, with anything, I mean, you knew this was the agreement. Yeah, really. [Sara] We can talk about it later. In due time. Yeah, that's all right. Yeah. No, I'm all right. - [girl speaking French] - [chuckles] [in French] Yes, I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming. [in English] Sweetie, just go celebrate, really. Go have fun. [Sara] Okay. Anne, I... I love you, you know? You are my darling. I love you too. [Sara blows kisses] [Anne] Okay. This is... This is fine. This was our agreement. What? Am I in the presence of that big radio celesbian Jip? Yes. [chuckles] How are you? Hmm, yeah, stuff. We'll... talk about it later. You sure? We can talk about stuff. You know that, right? No, really, it's okay. Hello! We're gonna celebrate your success. - Yes. - Yes. How are you? [Jip] Great. Man, I'm killing it right now. [woman] I happen to know one other cis straight woman. Maybe you girls know her. It's possible. I'm fine with whatever if it's not in my face. - Okay, okay, okay. Yes. I love you. - Gross, gross, gross. Gay rights and stuff. ♪ Love is love ♪ "Gay rights and stuff." - Daan, the true ally. - [chuckles] Right. [sighs] Lovely darlings, I want to toast to this amazing woman, and she's my woman, because she has a fucking radio show. [cheering] - Cheers. - Yes! All right. Whoo! - Make eye contact! - Lousy sex otherwise, yep! And we don't want that. Hey, but seriously, bitches, I hope you listen to all the fucking episodes, 'cause I'm creating an amazing, brand new platform for young artists, queer artists, artists of color, and just fucking awesome music, so, please spread the word. Oh, honey, I've already told everyone, okay? The only person left is the king! Thanks. No, but seriously, the first show's gonna be gnarly. Nana Adjoa is coming in to play live, and Lion Storm wanted... Yes, darling. Very cool, darling. Ugh, I'm really fucking proud of you, Jippie. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thank you. I love you. [woman] And you? How was your meeting with that publisher? Do tell. [Anne] Oh, right... Uh, yeah, um, it was fine. I have to rewrite a few things and make some adjustments. [woman] Can we read it soon? Uh, almost. Yeah, almost. We're definitely doing, like, a goodbye/the-book-is-finished thing. Aren't we? [woman] Oh my God, you're leaving us soon. Yeah, we've got a couple weeks still, right, guys? You don't sound too excited. Oh, I am! I am! Totally. I just have to handle some things. [man] Okay, like what? Hmm? Well, uh, just stuff. - You're still leaving? - Yeah, of course, hello. Yeah. - I'm calling it. She's staying. - Yeah! [laughs] Okay, Jesus, you guys. I'm just not super excited in this moment, all right? I'm just tired. Chill, okay? Okay, sorry. It's fucking annoying. You always make it seem as if I'm just a huge goddamn mess. So how about you try to be on my side? Everything's totally cool. - It's all right. - Okay. - Hey, who wants something to eat? - Yeah. Should I get us snacks? [woman] Aw, you're gonna get that for us, sweetie? Really? - [man] Can I have beet balls? - [woman] Beet balls? - [woman 2] Want a cheese plate? - Yes, cheese plate. Uh, yeah. A cheese plate, I think I heard. [Jip] Cheese plate! [woman] She wants some cheese. [sighs] I WILL REALLY MISS MY FAM # FRIENDS #THELASTWEEKS #LOVE LET'S CONTEMPLATE #LEAVEEVERYTHINGFORAMOMENT THIS WOMAN #LOVE LE_LOUP IS FOLLOWING YOU LE_LOUP LIKES YOUR POST ACTIVIST - DRAG KING (THEY/THEM) [rain pattering] [sighs] Yeah, what does the heroine want? Right? What's her goal? Is there an antagonist? Um... It's not eventful. It... Yeah, it rambles. And there is a whole lot of talking. I mean, really a massive amount of talking. And it's interesting, but it's also drifting back and forth between plot-driven and character-driven. Um, I do believe that you will need to make a clear choice... [Anne] Does she like women? Would Saar be jealous if we hooked up? Or we could also, um... [Anne] Fuck it. [dance music playing] [coach] Anne? Anne? - What? - [coach] Are you listening? Yeah. Yep, it rambles. It, um... It rambles. Should I send Lou a message? Yes, of course. Sara's got a girl in Montreal. You can send a DM. - Yeah, right? Yeah. - [scoffs] Yeah. [man in movie] They are going to be our new neighbors. - [woman] Just when I thought... - Here we go again. [woman] ...I met her. Elizabeth. Katherine. Pleasure. [chuckles] Oh, Katherine, if only I didn't have a sexist husband that abuses me, I would be with you forever. I'm sorry, Elizabeth. I'm too pretty to come out and it's the 1800s, so let's just kiss in secret and stare at each other. - [both laugh] - [movie goer] Shh. [shudders] I will love you forever. But I can't do this. [Elizabeth] Katherine. Be brave. Hey, well, what should I send her? Or wait, "them." It says "they/them" in their bio. Yeah. Yeah, just send something like, "Hey, how about we get a drink?" "Because my girlfriend has someone else so I need someone too." Otherwise it throws the balance off, and that's not cool." Come on. "And it's way easier than talking about it with my girlfriend. XO, Anne." Hey, stop. - [chuckles] - [sighs] I'll just say, like, "Hey, how was your weekend?" That's hot. - Like, I'm so horny. - [laughs] - Lil, seriously. - That's fine, dude. Just send that. Okay. Yeah, I've still got some stuff to arrange. I'll get my passport this week. [Sara sighs] Anne, I really don't get how you can handle doing everything at the last minute. Mm-hmm. - I know. Just let me. - [Sara scoffs] How is it going with, um... - [Sara] With Zoey? - Yeah. Uh, good. It's fun. We hang like once a week or whatever. She really wants to meet you. Is that okay with you? Or would you rather avoid doing that? Yeah, no, yeah, that's... Yeah, fun. We can FaceTime some time. [Anne] Anne, really? [Sara] Really? Yeah, okay, fun. I'll tell her. And how are you? And the book? Did you turn everything in? [Anne] Shit. Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's fine. I've got some minor rewrites to do, fine-tuning and stuff. [Sara] Ah, I'm so proud of you, babe. You just wrote your first novel. That's amazing. Yeah. Hey, if something's wrong, you should just say. Or if you're not comfortable with something. No, everything's fine. I love you, yeah? [Sara] I love you too. [sighs] [Sara] So... we can only date other people if we're both okay with it. [Anne] Yeah. And do we want to get into details? - Maybe not if it's just sex, right? - Hmm. But what if it turns into dating? Um... Yeah, I don't know. We'll just have to communicate, right? Yeah, can I get it in writing that you're gonna communicate? - [mocking] - [laughs] No, I'm joking. [chuckles] No, but seriously, that sounds good. [Anne] Yeah. And also, we should speak up about our doubts and our boundaries if we have them. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And also give each other space because that's the point of being polyamorous, right? Yeah. Yeah, I think it's so good we're doing this. - Right? Ha. Look at us. - Yeah. [man] Hmm. Yeah, that's great. Looks all right. Oh, um... No, it's just this was still in there. Yeah, great. No problem. - Uh, it's 40, right? - Yeah, 40. [indistinct chatter] [Anne] Oh God, how do you do this again? Okay. - Hey. - Oh. - How are you? - Great. Uh, what are your pronouns? Um, she/her. Okay, cool. Mine are they, them, and their. [Anne] I already saw that on your Instagram. Cool. That and pretty much all my exes like your photos. It is such a nice feeling when you walk onto the stage and you hear everyone going like... "Ah!" I could never do that, the drag king thing. [Lou] Why not? You're up on stage with everyone looking. You have to act all sexy. - Is feeling sexy hard for you? - Me? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, um... Um... I really don't know. Well, and I never thought about it, I guess. Okay. When do you feel the most sexy? [laughs] I think when I'm confident. Yeah, I'm not really into sexy clothing or lingerie or stuff like that. I never actually feel sexy sexy. Whatever that means, but... Something I'll think, "I'm looking good." But sexy, that's... No. [Lou] Sexy's a broad concept though, right? It's just not all about sexy clothing or lingerie. - It's different for everyone. - Yeah, I think so too. Yeah, my girlfriend, Sara, for instance, she likes to wear lingerie and stuff. But it doesn't really do it for me. [laughs] No, I find her real sexy, but it's when she's just feeling good, making coffee in her underwear, when she is in, like, total work mode on a Zoom call with colleagues from all over the world. That's sexy. Anyway, yeah. You have a girlfriend? Um... [clears throat] Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, but we're open, poly. [Lou] Okay, but... Wait a sec, okay? You're writing a book, and then you're off to the other side of the world? How come? Yeah, that's just the plan. Weird plan. Yeah. - [Lou] Yeah. - Yeah. [chuckles] I just want this book to kick ass. But then... [sighs] I was asked what I actually have to communicate. Yeah. So now I'm always thinking, "Yeah, do I really have any life experience?" "Do I need to write a book on it?" "Is that what the world really needs right now?" So what do you want to write about? About friendship and... and relationships and love and identity. Gender and expression. About being queer. Okay. What does being queer mean for you? I don't know. Well, yeah, I do know. Being a lesbian and being queer and coming out shaped me into the person that I am now, which means I wouldn't want it to be different because it's a big part of my identity. It's my whole life. But as a queer person, you know, I do live in a heteronormative society, so I approach everything from a queer perspective. And I think that's the story I want to tell. I want to show how fun it is to be queer and bring people into that world, you know, 'cause being queer is fun and exciting. And it's difficult. And real and love-filled. And everything. Being queer is everything. Yeah... [chuckles] Yeah, it's so much more than I imagined when I was in the closet. [Lou] Yeah. I'm also happy I can... be proud of something I was ashamed of for so long. So I want to showcase that and, yeah, the fact that I feel so much more comfortable now. And why is that? That I'm more comfortable? Because of time. [chuckles] Yeah, things just take time, right? Yeah, and I've also become very mature, of course. [both chuckle] Yeah. YOU'VE SKIPPED YOUR FRENCH LESSON FOR 3 DAYS You have to keep it up. You have to keep trying and not just avoid things because it's easier. - Patience works, talking works. - [chuckles] - Must talk... - Okay. Okay. - I sometimes take... - Does not make it easier. - Knock it off. - [chuckles] I sometimes take them to a queer lecture or film or something, try to bring them into my world a bit. Hmm? Yeah, yeah, okay, but that won't work with my parents. [Lou] Why not? Just do it. Hey, Lou, I'm happy for you guys, but my process is different. Oh, sorry. But anyway, tell me your political story. - Yeah? - Yeah. - [Lou] Are you sure? - Throw it at me. [both laugh] Okay, here it is, right? Well, we divide the world into two groups. And the group you're in determines how you're treated, okay? Now, men aren't allowed to cry, women can't use tools, and actually, girls are totally subordinate anyway, right? That's a completely bizarre system to use, right? And we invented that system. Yeah, there's like no wiggle room to what the idea of being a woman is allowed to even look like. Right. Right. And it was invented by us, just like money, for example. We just print it. Bam, bam, bam, bam. [chuckles] The Internet was invented by us. Language, photography, art, politics, gender constructs. We invented it all. So now, why can't we keep inventing? Or re-inventing? How come being non-binary and wanting to break free from invented constructs is not done for so many people? Yeah. Like with language, it keeps on evolving, and that's the beauty of it. - So what's the matter? Tell me. - [Anne] Mm-hmm. With they, them, and their pronouns? Yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah, well, that's it. Well, you got me. [door opens] - Hey, Jippie. - Yo, Anne. When was the last time you talked with Saar? - Uh... why? - [Jip] Well, I got a text from her telling me it's been a while since she got a reply from you and she can't get in touch with you. [Anne] Fuck. [Jip] I didn't even have her new number. I never text with her anyway, so isn't it weird that she felt the need to get a hold of me 'cause she can't get in touch with you? Yeah, shit. [Jip] What the hell are you doing, man? Just talk to her. [sighs] Yeah, I know. Is everything else okay with you? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. I... You're right. I just have to speak with Saar. Yep, I am right. [chuckles] Well, sort it out, girl. And let's grab a beer or something soon. We don't kick it enough, man. Yeah, you're right. I'll hit you up. Sweet. Later. [sighs] [Anne] There you go. - Oh my God, sweetie. - What? We got the house. - Oh my God, sweetie. Our dream house? - [laughs] I know. And those beautiful steps outside. Yeah. Let's reply. - Okay. - Yep. Um... - Cher Antoine... - Cher... Yes. [sighs] HEY, SWEETIE. EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? Ooh, this. Try this one on. So this is blending, what you're doing? I'm actually just making all the lines I applied a touch softer. This seems too much. - [Anne] Oh yeah. - [artist] Yeah. Drag is so much more than a fun dress-up thing. It is a way to rebel against... the norm. [artist] Ooh. - [all] Whoo! - Oh my God. Maxie. - Oh God, you look amazing. - Yeah, thanks. Yeah, and drag came out of protest. That's what we really owe everything to. I mean, the Stonewall riots for example. People in drag and trans women of color were on the frontlines there. I think it's just very important to be aware of what we owe pride, as well as drag culture too. - Yeah, I love it. Can we get a pic? - [laughs] I'm, like, fan-girling. [giggles] - [camera clicks] - Mm. That's nice. Look. - Oh, cute. - So gorgeous. - So good. - Beautiful. You have a naturally strong jaw line. - Yeah? - [artist] Yeah, really. Would you like some facial hair maybe? Uh, yeah. A beard sounds cool. [camera clicking] - Whoa, Lil, looking good. - Thanks. - [artist] Nice dick you got there. - [chuckles] - Well, gorgeous... - Huh? What? - And, uh, what is your name? - Jennifer. Enchantée. Okay, everyone. Come together for a minute. - [all] Okay. - [Lily] All right, yes. - [Lou] Join us. Join us. - [Maya] Yes, yes, yes. [Lou] Drag is about reclaiming your space. Claiming space as a queer. You're always looked at. And... And this is a way to turn it into a positive. Dare to take that space. - Yeah? Yeah? - [all] Yes. [dance music playing] [music slows and fades] [Max] This is so nice! Ah! [chuckles] [sniffles] [cries] [Jip] Anne, what's wrong? [cries] Nothing. [sighs] I just love you. - [Jip] Dude, are you hammered? - [cries] No, I mean it. What am I gonna to do without you? Yeah, nothing. You're nothing without us you. - Hey. [cries] - [laughs] We love you too, Annie. - You guys, stop. Hold up. - [Max] Huh? - What's up? - [Jip] Dude, Anne's all emo. - [chuckles] - [Max] Oh, what is it, darling? - [chuckles] - [Max] What's the matter, pookie? No. [chuckles] - Come here. - [all] Oh! Oh! [Max] Come on. We love you, Annie. - [Maya] Oh, get over here, baby girl. - [Lily] Love you. Oh, goddamn it, I love you guys so much. [all] Ooh. [all howling] Two cheese snacks, one vegetable... Wha... What? - One vegan vegetable croquette. - A veggie vegetable... - Veggie, right? - Vegetable? Yeah, a veggie croquette. And, uh, Lily? - Deep-fried noodles. - Gross, seriously? - Deep-fried noodles. - [Anne] And deep-fried noodles. - [laughs] - Of course, coming up. Thank you. Hey, Lou is, like, super fun, right? - Yeah, she is so fun. - They. Oh. Yeah, sorry. And yeah, so true, right? Uh-huh. [Max] You two get into any lickin' or stickin' yet? [all laughing] - [Anne] No. - Why? Just oh my God. I'm not sure if that's something I should do. - [Jip] You like them, right? - Yeah. - You're in a poly relationship? - Yeah. [Lily] And you're leaving for Montreal soon. [Teun] Yeah... No. [Jip] Does Sara know? No. Well, this is a fun conversation. No, wait a sec. So no Montreal? Totally. Totally. Yeah, of course. No! Guys, I don't fucking know. I really just... I really don't know. In two weeks, I'm supposed to emigrate. What the fuck? And I gotta be out of my house. And rewrite my whole book. Come to my house. Seriously? Yeah. [burps] Sounds fun. [sighs] [pensive music playing] [sighs] [grunts] [yawns] [grunts] [Anne] Yeah. Now what? [sighs] Everything okay? You seem distracted or something. Oh, no, I'm fine. Really? [scoffs] Yeah, I've had a lot on my mind, but don't worry. You can tell me anything. Talk to me. [sighs] Okay, come on. Let's get a drink. [laughs] What did you think when we first met? Sweet. Mm... complicated. Listens well, talks badly. Yeah? All of that from our first meeting? - I'm a good judge of character. - Hmm. Yeah. And attractive, of course. I was gonna say. [chuckles] And you? What about me? Hmm... Attractive, of course. And... smart. And interesting and ethical. - Ethical? - [laughs] Yes... Sorry. Well, yeah. Yeah. Yes, actually. I immediately felt at ease with you. Like I... Yeah, I could talk about almost anything without being judged. Yeah, me too. I think it's just a generational thing really. - Yeah? - Yeah, for our parents, everything was all mapped out and obvious. Few uncertainties. - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't think they learned to talk about anything. - Nope, mine definitely didn't. - [both chuckle] Yeah, and they never understand our problems, right? Because they think, - "Hey, I was young once, just like you." - Yeah. - Yeah, you heard that? - Yeah. "And I've come this far without any trouble, - so you should also be able to." - Yeah. Yep. That's exactly what my parents are like. [chuckles] - They really don't understand. That's it. - No, they really don't. Nope. I'm not gonna do that. - I cannot remain silent. - No. No. [chuckles] I want a family. And I want my kids to feel like they can tell me and each other anything. Mm-hmm. Like, there's not some sort of weird tension when we talk about a certain topic. And we don't have to keep shit bottled up. I just want true love. Just honest love, you know? No fuss, no drama, just openness. What? Come here. Anyway, you were saying something serious? Uh, yeah. I just need to recover from that ambush. [chuckles] [Lou chuckles] You're a good kisser. Well, thank the Lord. [both chuckle] You make everything a joke, right? Oh, uh... Well... [Anne] Maybe. Yeah, maybe. Yes. [chuckles] Yeah, it's some kind of distraction or something so you don't have to be vulnerable. [sighs] It's also kind of sweet. [Lou] You are really fucking sexy. I mean it. Look at you. [sighs] Hot, right? [chuckles] Yeah. [heavy breathing] [moaning] - [Lou] Can I fuck you? - [Anne] Huh? Aren't... Aren't we... Yeah, but I mean with a strap-on. Oh, uh... I've never tried that before. Oh, no? No. We don't have to do it if you don't... [chuckles] - Yeah. I want to. - Yeah? Are you okay? Yeah? Uh-huh. [moaning] I want to ride you. [moans] Fuck, yeah. [moaning] Yeah. Oh my God. God, I feel like a teenage boy. I never come so fast. That was good, huh? That was really very hot. - Yeah, you're hot. - You too. [sighs] You know, I've wanted to try that forever, but I just never did. Why not? I don't know. I had a totally fine sex life with Sara. People miss out on so much not sharing their fantasies with each other. [laughs] Yeah, apparently. [both chuckle] As soon as you entered me, I couldn't take it. I felt that. Yeah? Yeah, you completely relaxed. You fully surrendered. Thank you. What for? For, well... the sex, I think. [laughs] No one ever thanked me for sex before. [both laugh] Yeah. I'm an idiot. [both chuckle] Sorry. Pfft. This was just... [whirring] [grunts] [exhales, clears throat] SARA MATOUK - TODAY 5 MISSED CALLS HEY, SWEETIE. I'M IN AMSTERDAM. CAN WE MEET THIS AFTERNOON? Oh my God. [Lou] What? Um... Sara's in Amsterdam. [Lou] Oh. - Didn't know she was coming? - No, I had no idea. Ooh, so... Fuck. Uh, you're gonna meet her, right? - Uh, I don't know. - [scoffs] Get a grip. You're going. - [groans] - You two have plenty to talk about. No, can't I please hide with you? Anne, fuck you. She's your girlfriend. You can't avoid her to hang out with me. [Anne sighs] - Here. - I was joking. Yeah, hilarious. Ha ha ha. Get up. [groans] Just say what you feel. Yeah. - Hey. - [Sara] Hey. [both chuckle] - I love you. - I love you. [Anne] Okay. I don't want to go to Montreal. Hmm? Hmm? Oh, I thought... - [sighs] - [Anne] Oh, was that not out loud? Come on, Anne. Anyway... the whole book needs a rewrite. [Sara] Oh? Yeah. [scoffs] Yeah, they actually hated it. What the hell? Your book is everything and more. Yeah, well, they had some good points and, like, content and style notes. I really think it's bullshit. Yeah, but it's really not. Okay. I have to stay here a bit longer. Ah. - To do the rewrite. - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm just tired. Jet lag. Yeah. I came here all the way for you, you know. Yeah, just for me. Huh? I don't really think you're here just for me. There's just a bump in the road of your plan now, and I'm the cause of it. You're not a bump in the road. Yes, I am. Sweetie, no, you're not at all. Don't be silly. Where did you come up with that? [sighs] Sorry. I really have no idea. God, I really missed you. I know. [sighs] [sighs] [Anne] Why is this so hard? [phone buzzes] NOW APPLY FOR PASSPORT AT CITY HALL [phone vibrating] [sighs] [sniffles] [crying] Hey, what's up? Shit, dude. [crying] [Anne] She's already asleep. Not now. So when are you gonna do it then? Not now. Or should I? Okay, Anne. Just say what you feel. Saar. [Sara] Hmm? Saar? Can... - Yeah? - ...we talk? [Sara] Now? Yeah. Wow, okay. [sighs] Okay. I love you. And you're sweet and pretty and smart and sexy, but... [sighs] But I'm not ready to go to Montreal. Okay. And I don't really know if I want to go at all. You want a long-distance relationship? No. Oh. Yeah. I don't think I can do it. [Sara] Are you ending this? Yes. I think so. You think so? You probably should be sure. Yeah, I'm sure. [scoffs] [Anne weeping] Um, okay. Sorry, I... I don't understand. We had a plan. Everything was going well. No, Saar, you had a plan, and I had to follow it. - What? - [sobs] And I also met someone. Not that it matters. - You wanna be with her? - No, them, no. And that doesn't matter either. [sighs] Okay. I feel like I... only go along with things that you want and I don't think about what I want. So you're just gonna break up with me without even talking about it? It's not like this is random, Saar. I've been having doubts for a really long time. Then say something. Yeah. Saar, you can look at me like that, but you're not the easiest person to talk to. - [scoffs] - Seriously. There's no room for it. You ask about my feelings, but you ignore all of the answers. [Sara] Jesus. [footsteps retreating] Saar, sweetie. Hey, I'm sorry, all right? [sighs] It's just... [scoffs] I just don't want this. I don't want to go to Montreal. I don't want a poly relationship. Yeah, yeah. I know you to and whatever, but I just can't do it anymore. You were fine to be with me and whoever this she/they are called... Seriously? You think I was fine with that? You must've enjoyed it. More than with me, that's for sure. Yeah, at least with them I could talk. Yes. - [scoffs] - Yeah. I had great conversations. [Sara] Super, Anne. This is fantastic. Thanks. Yeah. And since when are you against poly relationships? I'm not against all poly relationships. I'm against this one. It was a last resort for us. That's not healthy. I never wanted to do it. Why didn't you say that ever? - I mean, how many fucking conversations... - Yeah, you don't listen. You don't want to hear it. That's why I can't talk to you. Talking would be a lot easier if you learned to communicate better. I mean, how fucking difficult is it really? - Yeah. - I can't smell what you think. What a weak excuse to avoid any responsibility. - Really, sometimes, Saar... Saar? - Yeah? Sometimes you have to put a little more effort in to have a conversation, you know? You have to observe. - Oh. - Just use your eyes. Yeah, good, good. Like that. I am alone in this relationship. What? What kind of, like, melodramatic... Seriously, what have you contributed? Can you even think of one thing? What are you talking about, Sara? I have to make all the plans because you don't. No, it's because you don't ask what I want! Saar, that's the reason! You just came here to pick me up. - Really, I swear. - Seriously? You didn't come here to solve things. You just wanna impose your plan on me. You're fucking egotistical, is what you are. - You don't care about what I want. - You are such a defeatist, Anne. You think the entire world is against you. [mocking] Oh, you've had it so hard. How the fuck can you complain? You're such a spoiled little white girl sometimes. Fuck you, Saar. Fuck you. There are worse things in the world than a failed book and a failed relationship. [scoffs] So our relationship failed? - This is what I'm saying! - What? That was your take-away from this conversation? Oh my God, girl, seriously. Is that what you call this? Standing here in the middle of the night fucking screaming at each other. Yeah? Okay, we're done. Good. [Sara] This is so fucking cowardly. - But I'm used to it by now. - [Anne] Fine, Saar. Fine, Saar. That's great. Call me a coward. Just call me a coward. I always feel like I'm not enough for you. I've never been smart enough, ambitious enough, or sexy. [Sara] That's the first I'm hearing about this. Not sexy enough? Since when is that an issue? I find you very sexy. Well, you never say it. Oh, and your new love does, huh? She meets one person and compares our entire relationship with it. I should've known. - Lou is not my love. - Lou. Yes, Lou, yeah. Nice, nice name. I just realized how horrible I feel when I'm with you. Anne, I won't do this. - I won't be accused of all this. - Well, you make me feel like a loser. That's because you never bother to look at yourself! [Anne exhales] [Sara groans] [Sara sobs] Anne? Anne... You're the first girl I fell in love with. The very first girl I introduced to my parents. I want to spend my life with you, Anne. Anne... [Anne sighs] You only want to spend your life with me, Saar, as long as it's on your terms. No, Goddamn it. Yes, I mean it, Saar. I just don't want this anymore. [crying] [crying] [Sara] I, uh... I'm leaving. Yeah. [Sara] Okay. I hope you can find a way to be joyful with yourself and the rest of the world.

[Anne's dad] Here you go. [door opens] [door closes] [sighs] So you're still on the couch? I went to the bathroom, and I made lunch, washed the dishes. Okay, Annie, let's try something. Let's go walk tomorrow. [sighs] [Anne] Dad. [Anne's dad] Come on, Annie. Sometimes you just have to flip a switch, you know? Or you'll never get anywhere. - You're one to talk. - What's that mean? You're no ray of sunshine since the divorce. You never talk about it. [Anne's dad] Some things are difficult to talk about. Yeah, I know that. - You raised me to never talk about stuff. - Annie. Seriously. When do we ever talk about our feelings or deeper issues? Why don't we talk about the divorce? Why does it always have to stay fun? It feels like I'm always saying the wrong things. You never let me be myself, Dad. It's because that's not something that you taught me how to do. That's enough, Anne. You can't blame everything on us. You are an adult. Start acting like one. - It's your life. You control it. - Are you serious? I'm sorry if we didn't talk about every little minor problem. But if you want to change, change it. You know, it's not always your environment. Sometimes you cause your problems. And yes, that's unpleasant and not easy to admit, but it's a virtue. You... [sighs] You're walking away? - Well, that's very mature. - [Anne's dad] No, I want a drink. That's fine. Have a drink. I'll be at the house. [sighs] EVERYTHING OKAY? [door opens] [door closes] [Anne's dad sighs] [sighs] Sorry, Annie. I shouldn't have walked away. I'm sorry too. How do you feel? [scoffs] Pop, we don't have to talk about our feelings this minute. No, I mean it. You're down in the dumps. What can I do? Nothing. Okay, well, what can you do? How can you feel happy or relaxed? How do you unwind? Uh, writing, I think. Do that then. Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing that. I have to rewrite my book. Well, keep it up then. Yeah. [chuckles] Would you wanna read it? I wanna hear your thoughts. Yeah, I'd love that. So who's in it? Well, everybody. But with different names and it's been dramatized. Funny, man. Your friends? Tell me what you wrote about me. [chuckles] You are the best friend who the main character doesn't pay enough attention to even though she deserves it because she's always there. And the main character should apologize for that. Are you saying sorry? Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. It's okay. You were there when I needed it, and I'm here for you, right? Love you, Jippie. All right. I love you too. [sighs] And, um... us? Yeah? It was fun, right? Yeah. [chuckles] - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm not looking for anything serious. I think you're really cool and super chill to hang with, but I'm not looking for more right now. Yeah. Same here, I think. [chuckles] Sorry, it's so chill how direct you are. That would've taken me weeks to come up with. I know. That's why I did it. [chuckles] And I just found out that I, myself, was lost, and I couldn't be myself in my relationship with my ex, and also with my parents. But there's a good amount that's positive too. It's really very personal. I mean, all my friends are in it. It's super queer. Uh, it's actually become a collection of memories. And you were right about the searching and who was the hero of the story. I have subconsciously... I've just been sabotaging my own life. I... I took everything for granted. But, okay, yeah, I stand behind this 100%, so if you don't like it, then I don't know what to do anymore. I guess, it's over. - [publisher] Anne... - Hmm? I thought it was great. Oh. - Really? - [publisher] Yes, it's still searching, but with a goal. And you feel how personal it is, but it's also very relatable. You really found your story. [sighs] Well, that's good. - And the title? - Yeah, um, it's about who the protagonist is in relation to the people around her, so hence the... I understand. [chuckles] [Stella] Anne! Whoo hoo! [Max] Hey! Ho! - Hey! - [all laughing] [Max] Yoo-hoo! [all cheering] - Hey, shantay, you stay, prick. - Yeah. What's all this? [Max] Yeah, well, we had originally organized a going-away party for you, but now... Now it's an Anne-is-staying-here party. And hopefully an Anne-finished-her-book party. Oh, God, I love you so much. And your book? Yeah, it's gonna get published. [cheering] Cheers. [laughs] [Max] To you, dear Anne, and to your book, which you, of course, owe completely to us because, well, we are all in it. Yes, well, yeah. - [Jip] Cheers! - Cheers! [Maya] Salud! Thanks, darlings. - I made skewers. - [Teun] No, you didn't. Maya made them. - Hey, have a drink. - Are you hungry? Do you want to eat? What are you having? Hamburger with fries? - We all just brought pot luck to share. - That's good.
