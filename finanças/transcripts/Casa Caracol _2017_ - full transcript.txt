SNAIL HOUSE Hi. Do you want something to drink? - Hi. - A whisky bro and for the lady, whatever she wants. What do you drink? A beer, please. Thanks. Cheers. So... ...you live alone? What's the matter? Leave please. I can't stay? No. Fucking crazy. Your room is number seven, upstairs right down the hall. Thanks. - Here's your check. - Thanks. Excuse me, do you know the way to the pools? Yes, take this path down... ...to where the old road begins, it's more or less twenty minutes. - This path down here? - Yes, but right now it's late and they're closed. Do you know what time they open? No I don't, but this young man lives there. Do you know what time they open the pools? At nine. Thanks. Hey... - Have you got a hotel? - Yes, I'm staying nearby. Okay... Near the pools, there's a hostel called Snail House, if you want, come tomorrow and I can show it to you and give you a special price. - Okay. - Cool. Hey! My name is Nico. Hi, Ana? I'm Sofia. Yes, I'm fine thank you. I'm in a village... ...in the Huasteca. Yes, really. I'm fine. No, it's quiet here. Well, I just needed to take a break... ...and that's it. In the office, everything's okay, there's no problem. No... they think I'm on a professional trip. Yes, that's why I'm also calling you. Can you feed the cat? Read all about this helpless woman... ...who was sexually abused by this man... ...don't be said, don't be told... Then, see everything about the awful gunfight that occurred in Valles City. Know everything about the army that seizes twenty kilos of cocaine. Hi. Hi. I thought you wouldn't come. I saw the sign and I came to see. Have you already been to the pools? Yes. I went this morning. Can I see the rooms? How long are you staying? A week, I guess. The bathrooms and the showers are in the house. And the rooms above have a bathroom? Yes. And hot water? Ricardo. - Ricardo. - I'm coming. - What's up? - What's up bro? This friend wants to stay in one of the rooms. She asks if you're okay for two hundred a day. Which one? A tipi? No. One of the ones above. She'll stay the whole week. Well, if she's staying the whole week, then yes. - Welcome. Let me go for the key. - Thanks. Okay. Keep going. I'll see you in the square. Are you going to stay in the teepee? No, in one of the rooms. What's your name? - Sofia. - I'm Claudia. - Hi! - Good morning. - Do you want a coffee? - Yes! - Some bread. - It looks good! Thanks. It's hot. Be careful. And where are you from? From San Luis. - I was an assistant manager in a bank. - Are you serious? I got bored. I didn't like it anymore. One day... I sold all the stuff I had, and I left... ...and I found this place. Have you ever wanted to go back? No I live here very peacefully... I always meet new people... I enjoy my time. Sure. And you? What brings you here? With my husband we wanted to make something like this, a little hotel like this one. But it's been almost two years since he disappeared. I didn't want to... ...be intrusive, sorry. Don't worry, we would have been your competitors! Yes. One day, he went to work and... ...he didn't come back. But... He had some problems? Was he kidnapped? He left? That's it. Bravo! You can do it. That's it. That's it! Bravo! Bravo! That's it! Bravo! He's Hector. Don't be afraid, he hardly speaks. He ate shrooms and he's still tripping. Here he helps Ricardo. He runs errands for the guests and things like this. What's up? So? Isn't it better here than in the village? Yes, it seems so. Well, I'm leaving, I'll put my child to sleep. Do you want to go to swim? Now? Let's go! Come on. They say that when the English man who built this place arrived here he entered to swim in this pool, and a lot of butterflies came up... ...and that's why he decided to stay here. - It's beautiful here, isn't it? - Yes. - Are you cold? - No. So, you bring all the American girls here? Of course not. Hi! - Good morning! - Good morning! - Are you coming from the square? - Yes. Did you see the dead man? No. Which dead man? It seems that a young man died in the square. - Are you sure? Right now? - Yes. They say that he was dancing, and then he fell to the floor. It seems that he had a heart attack. - I was there and I saw nothing. - It just happened. What do you want? Just a coffee please. Thanks. - Here you are. - Thank you. Today, there's not many people. No, it's seasonal, right now it's calm. But holidays start next week and many people will come. Actually, I need help. Would you be interested? I've never worked as a waitress. Besides, I'll leave soon. That's easy, I'll teach you... and in regards to time, just tell me when you have to go. Cheers! - For the pleasure. - For the pleasure of sharing. The same. And how did you get here to Xilitla? Here, the wind brought me here. Well, I'm retired and this is a place I like and I spend six months here, then six months travelling and here I've some business affairs. Hector! Come here for a moment. Your sneakers are all fucking destroyed, bro. Let's see. Try these ones. Do they fit you well? Done, and finally throw those in the trash, please. Go on. Do you deal? Yes, to gather more money. What I earn with Ricardo, it's okay to live but, if I want to go, I need more cash. Where do you want to go? To the States. Ricardo knows, doesn't he? Yes, of course. He's like my brother. He keeps the money I'm saving. But I still need more. What? You think you'll be better there? I don't know. It'll be the same. There's nothing here to make me stay. I love being with you. I feel happy. - Coffee. - Thanks. Hey, what happened with his father? We weren't ready. We met in a party mood and when I got pregnant he got thrown off. So I decided to have him alone. And you're with someone? Well, sometimes with Ricardo, nothing serious. And you and Nico? Well, nothing. Who knows. - Cheers. - Cheers. What? Nothing. I was wondering how many girls you have been with. With how many guys have you been with? I don't know. How many? Ten or eleven. Ten or eleven? Eleven. With you, eleven. And you? Me what? How many? I don't know. Fifteen? Twenty? A few more. Twenty five. Thirty. Yeah, around that more or less. What? 'I love myself a lot because I pick up all the gringas who come here. ' - Bullshit... Of course not! - Of course yes! From the Public Prosecutor's Office? And... What did they say? They always say the same thing. And when do I have to go? Okay. Are you still missing much to be able to go? No. I have enough. I think that, if I'm working hard, in two or three months, I'm done. Let's leave together. I can't. Why? Ricardo! - What's up! - Hey, is Nico there? No, I haven't seen him. You've seen him? He told me he had to go for stuff in the village. It seems that he's in the village, Viny. There are some guys looking for him. For what? No idea bro, but they're asking for him. Okay, I'll tell him if I see him. - Fine, see you. - Fine. Hey, wait! Everything okay? Yes. And, he told you why they're looking for him? No. So, what did he tell you? Nothing. I asked him about some stuff that he's selling to me. Hi! Hey, I'm looking for Nico, have you seen him? No. I haven't. He's a big boy. Best keep away. This morning, they came to look for him too. This village seems to be quiet, but... things happen. You see the one they killed the other day in the square. He was killed? It wasn't a heart attack? That's what they said to not scare people, but he was stabbed. Thanks. Yes, see you. Hey! - Hey! - How's it going? Fine. You like it here? I love it. - Nice, huh? - Yes, it's paradise. Beautiful. Hi. What's up. Everything alright? Yes, everything's alright. Do you want to get in? No, thanks. Who is that? A friend. Don't get jealous, he's always like that. No, of course not. Rum? Thank you. - Cheers! - Cheers! You'll be acting like that all night? What? Are you going to keep flirting with the first one you meet? And you? You'll be like this all your life? Without making any decisions? Yes, I want to go with you. Let's go together. I'll be back in a minute! I'm sorry. I screwed up, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey. Forgive me. Hurry up! Take him away! What's wrong with you? Calm down, little bitch! Calm down. Calm down, sucker! Be quiet! Ready! You're a nice piece, mommy! You'll give me the pussy as you did with that asshole? Don't move bitch or I'll kill you! Ricardo! What? What's going on? They killed Nico. Where is he? He's up there! Hey! What happened? I don't know, I saw nothing, I was tied up. Okay Sofia, calm down. Calm down. Did you see if there was somebody else? No. No, no, I saw nothing. And where were you going? What? Where were you going? I didn't do anything! Calm down! Let's see... Did you see anyone? Well, yes. The guy who got me tied up, was the one with the leg brace the one who was with you the other day. Are you sure? Easy. Let's go downstairs. Leave this here. I think that Hector saw everything too. He made lots of noise and then he came. And where is he? Drink it. You'll feel better. Is there anybody there?! Here, I brought you food. Get me out of here. I don't have the key. Ricardo says that it's better for you to stay here until things calm down. Why? Eat this. I'll come back tomorrow. Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! How are you? Why did you lock me up? Who knows what Nico did to those guys, but it's better for you to stay here a while. I didn't do anything. You're safe here. Hector was arrested by the cops. Why? He didn't do anything. You're the only one who knows that. Ricardo, please, get me out of here - I swear that I won't say anything. - No, I can't. - They're looking for you to pay Nico's debts. Please! And why don't you pay them? You have his money, don't you? What money? Nico told me you kept his savings. That's not true. Ricardo, get me out of here! Get me out! Get me out of here! Hey! What's happening? Help me to get out of here! No! No! - Let's go! Come here! - Help! Shut up! Sofia. Don't worry, you'll be alright. I want to leave. You can only go if you state that Hector killed Nico. Otherwise, you won't. He didn't do anything. And why should you care? Let's see. Describe to me what you saw. I hardly saw anything, I was afraid. I was asleep and the noise woke me up. Hector came in and freaked out. Nico ran out and Hector went after him. I heard noise outside. I stood quiet. I was afraid. There was only that person? Yes. There wasn't anybody else? Tell me, there was someone or not? No. Go get your stuff and leave.
