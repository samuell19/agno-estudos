My name is John H. Groberg. I was born during the Great Depression in Idaho Falls, Idaho. My middle name is Holbrook, which was my mother's maiden name. Mom and Dad gave that name to all seven boys of which I am the oldest. We were poor, but we lived happily. Large doses of homemade bread and family music. My dad was a real estate appraiser and a prominent democrat, which is to say he was about the only democrat in Idaho Falls. One year President Harry Truman came to town, campaigning for reelection and my dad was selected to greet him. President Truman did very well among the Groberg clan that year. I went to school at a little place called Eastside Elementary. One morning our principal, Ms. Bunker, gathered all us kids out front. She told us something terrible had just happened in a place called Hiroshima, Japan, and she asked us to observe a moment of silence. All I knew about the Japanese was that we were at war with them and yet, standing there in front of my school, I felt something for them. Later in my life I would come to feel even more deeply about another people in a land far away. * Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid * Fool with half a mind he don't try to save * Heart says go go have a time * Saturday night and baby I feel fine * I'm gonna rip it up * Yeah rock it up * I'm gonna shake it up * I'm gonna break it up * I'm gonna ball it up * At the ball tonight * Well along about 10 I'm feeling high * I walk on out to the groovy sky * I don't care if I spend my dough * 'Cause I'm gonna be one happy soul * Gonna rip it up * Yeah rock it up * I'm gonna shake it up break it up * Ball it up crash it up * Rip it up * I'm gonna rock it up * At the ball tonight * Well I got me a baby and I won't be late * I picked her up in my 88 * Dragged on down by the social hall * When the joint starts jumping * Gonna have me a ball * Gonna rip it up * Yeah rock it up * I'm gonna shake it up break it up * Ball it up crash it up * Rip it up * I'm gonna rock it up * At the ball tonight - Hey. - Hey. - 'Scuse me. - Come on. - Guys, what are you doing? Hey, it's me, come on. - Sorry. - What are you doing? Whoa, hey, hey. - Go John! - I'll take that. * Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid * Fool with half a mind he don't try to save * Heart says go go have a time * Saturday night and baby I feel fine * I'm gonna rip it up * Yeah rock it up - I can't believe you John Groberg. - Ah ah ah. - What do you mean, ah ah ah? He's my date! - He was your date. - So what, I'm supposed to come to the dance by myself just because you're playing in the band, what? - No, you can come with whomever you want. As long as you leave with me. - Oh really? - Really. - Come on Jean, I wanna show you something. Come on, follow me! - Oh wow. Oh it's like heaven. - Do you like it? - Mm-hmm. - It's all yours. I had it made special. Moon too. Get in, I wanna show you something. - What? - Yeah. - Oh. - Look in the water, tell me what you see. - I see the moon. - Look again. - I see me and the moon. - Exactly. You and the light of the moon. You know how many miles that light traveled to shine on you? - I guess I don't. - 92 million, 300 thousand, give or take. You know what else? - What? - I think you were worth the trip. - Do you know what I think? - What? - I think you think too much. - Maybe I do. No matter where they send me, we'll be underneath the same moon. - You're hereby called to serve as a missionary to the people of the kingdom of-- - Tonga! You're going to Tonga! - Tonga. - Wait a minute. Where's Tonga? - Hey John, over here! - Speech! - Yeah, let's hear a speech, Delbert. - Go ahead, Dad. - I hadn't really prepared for this. Don't know how I could have. All my life I've been taught that God loved the world so much he gave the world his son. I used to think I knew what that meant. I didn't. I don't know anyone in Tonga well enough to love them and send them my son. But I guess God does. Keep that in mind during the hard times, son. How much God loves his children. - Oh listen to you going on like you know something. All aboard! - I love you Dad. - I love you too, son. - I love you Mom. - Don't come home, son. Don't come home early. Three cheers for John Groberg! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Bye, bye, see ya, bye. Dear Jean. It's okay you couldn't make it to the big farewell. I wouldn't have wanted you crying and making a fuss and if you hadn't cried, well, that would've been worse. There were seven of us missionaries on the boat. But the others were all continuing to Australia or New Zealand. I was supposed to meet the president of the Samoan mission at the dock and he was going to put me on another boat to Tonga. I guess he didn't know I was coming 'cause he didn't show up. After a couple weeks I finally found him, and he put me on a boat to Fiji, where he said I could catch another boat to Tonga. He also told me there would be two missionaries waiting for me at the dock. - Get off me boat, mate. Your ticket ends here. - Stop right there, you are not on our list. - Oh, piss on your bleedin' list, the boy gets off. - I will be arresting him. - That's his problem. - Ah, you crazy man. - Just get off the plank mate, or I'll have to push ya. - You are under arrest. - Elder Louis Armstrong. The missionaries in Fiji got me a job on a freighter to Tonga. I bunked with a guy named Swede who promised me a girl in every port if I left my mission and stayed on the boat. I told him one girl was enough for me. You know, I think he lost a lot of respect for me when I said that. When I finally got to Tonga, it was business as usual. Nobody knew I was coming. I guess word got around there was a kid from Idaho sitting on the dock because suddenly, out of the clear blue. - Groberg, Elder John Groberg? - Yes sir. - Where on earth have you been, young man? I prayed long and hard about your assignment. I think I have just the place for you. Niuatoputapu. - New what? - Oh it's a small island about 800 miles from here. There's no white people and no one speaks a lick of English. - Sounds great. - Well you have two assignments. Learn the language. Build a kingdom. Any questions? - No, I mean, yes. Who will be my companion? - Feki. Feki, I want you to meet your new companion, Elder Groberg. - Welcome Kolipoki. I've been praying for you. By far the hardest part of my trip was the eight day journey to my assigned island. The seas were rough and the boat small. I got seasick after the first hour and wished I were dead the entire trip. - Kolipoki. Poki. The island is here. Journey is over, let's go. Come, come. They call me Kolipoki because they can't pronounce Groberg down here. Someday I'll probably find out it actually means white guy with weak stomach. - Do you think there'll be someone there to greet us? Elder John Groberg, thank you so much for coming to greet me. - What is it with them? - What are they saying? - They are saying you are white and soft. I think they are right. Come. - What about our greeting party? The branch president? - Okay, you wait here, I'll go and find them. - That is really good. My tongue, I can't feel my tongue. - It's alright. - Tonight we celebrate the arrival. - Of our white brother Kolipoki. - Who comes as God's messenger to our tiny island. - He wants to know if you have any words for them. - Nuh-uh. I have to go to the bathroom. - I guess they all have to go also now. - Hate to see what happens when I take a bath. - Feki, Feki! Dear Jean, I hope all is well with you back in the United States. Things are okay here in Tonga. The island is beautiful, but quite small. Everyone is related to each other, and the few who might listen to us already belong to another church. Their minister has warned them not to listen to me which is kind of pathetic since I can't speak their language anyway. My mission president told me to learn the language and build up the church. So far I'm not doing very well at either. The mail boat comes just once a month and the only thing I'm looking forward to more than your letters is the mosquito net my mission president promised to send. They have a disease here the mosquitoes spread called elephantitis. Would you still love me if I came home looking like an elephant? Enough about poor old me. Tell me about you. What are you doing for Christmas? How did your finals go? Has Edward asked you to marry him yet? If so, please keep in mind the Tongan missionary who is trying hard not to come home looking like an elephant. I love you, you know. Write to me. John. - The branch president wants you to speak to the members this Tuesday. - How can I speak if I don't know the language? - He says we will pray for you very hard. - We will now hear from Elder Kolipoki. It will be a great talk. - What did I say? - Elder Outhouse! - Did I say that? - A boat is coming, Koli. There will be mail. Kolipoki? Mele? Kolipoki? Kolipoki. - In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And God said let there be light and there was light. And God saw the light and it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. Dear John. This is the fourth letter I've sent without hearing once from you. I hope I'll get a whole batch someday soon. I also hope and pray all is well with you. You remember Edward? Well, he proposed to me last week. I told him I'd have to think about it, that you and I have a deal. The funny thing is, I don't know what that deal is. I went out to our swing to think about it. The moon was shining and I remembered you saying no matter where we are, it will shine down on both of us. I felt close to you for just a moment as if the heavens connected us. I miss you, you know. Across the sky, I miss you. - Kolipoki, wake up. Kolipoki, you scared me. Come, let's go to work. Dear Jean. I've made progress with the language and the work is going much better. We're teaching a young man named Finau who is very excited about the gospel. He would already be baptized but his parents won't allow it. He and several villagers helped us build our own house. It was a lot of work but the hardest part was evicting the previous occupants. - Here we go, we got 'em. Huh, how 'bout that? Home sweet home. - It's the cry of death. Someone has died. They mourn his passing with their cries. - Of all God's creations, his children are his greatest glory. - Get off. - Is the pudding ready? - A professional mourner? - Yes. - How does she get paid? - Place to stay, food to eat. You know the best gift you can bring to a Tongan funeral is a sack of flour or a fat pig. - So Feki why are you so, why do you have such faith in me? - Why shouldn't I? You traveled so far to teach us, what you say must be true. - Yeah but what if I lied to you? - You wouldn't lie, Kolipoki. - But what if I did? - Then you come a long way just to tell a lie. When I was a boy, my father was a drinking man. He used to beat my mother. I wasn't strong enough to keep him off her. The missionaries, they came and they showed him the truth. Only the truth was strong enough. One day I went to thank them for their sacrifice and they just shook their heads and told me of other missionaries who sacrificed much more. They were sick to death with the fever. As they left their families behind and crossed the sea to preach God's word, they stood up in their wagons and they shouted, "Hurrah for Israel!" Every time I see my father after that, every time he wasn't drinking, I think the same thing. Hurrah for Israel. I think the same thing every time I hear you teach. - Hurrah. - Hurrah! - Hurrah for Israel! - Hurrah for Israel! - Hurrah! - Hurrah! - Kolipoki! Kolipoki! Kolipoki! He fell from a mango tree and hit his head on the roots. Take him. Bless him. Bring him back to me. - He's dead. - Whether he is dead or not I do not know. What I know is I want him well again and you have the power to do it. - Out goes the bad air, in comes the good. Out goes the bad air, in comes the good. Out goes the bad air, in comes the good. Out goes the bad air, in comes the good. Out goes the bad air, in comes the good. Out goes the bad air, in comes the good. Out goes the bad air, in comes the good. Out with the bad air, in with the good. Out with the bad air, in with the good. * The day is past and gone * The shadows of the evening fall * The night is coming on * We feel my heart a welcome place * We feel my home abide * Oh savior stay this night with me * Hold us even tight * Oh savior stay this night with me * Hold us even tight - Where am I? - Here is your son. He's alright. - Thank you, Kolipoki. I knew you would do it. - I didn't do it. - Papa. - My son. Dear Jean. Much has happened on our little island. Feki and I helped God heal a little boy and the whole island seems to be aware of it. I have a feeling we're going to be more accepted now. We're teaching a beautiful new family and are still working with Finau. Our last lesson was on the meaning of faith. - Like the oyster, things which are not seen, but which are true. I gave him a pearl as part of the lesson. - I understand. Besides the language you'll be happy to know I am working very hard on my burping. It's good manners here to belch after someone feeds you a meal. To think that all those years I thought I was being rude. So, Edward proposed to you. Surprise, surprise. Thanks for telling him we have a deal. As far as I'm concerned that deal is you will be madly in love with me two and a half years from now when I return from my mission, we will be married and live happily ever after. Seriously Jean, I think this island is the most beautiful place on earth. And the only thing that could make it lovelier would be your presence here. Someday I hope we can walk these sands together. Until then, I love you, John. - Ah. - What is it? - My feet. - Did you sleep with your feet uncovered? - I don't remember. It was hot! - I told you never to sleep with your feet uncovered! The rats, they come and eat the soles of your feet. - What? - Sit down. Wait here. - Oh sure, I'll just wait right here and bleed to death! What? - Your feet will have to be seared. We can use a hot knife or the sun. Over here, where the sun is the strongest. Dear John. I am glad to hear all is well with you. Thank you for sharing your version of our deal with me. As for my version of our deal, well, I'm not sure I see things as clearly as you do. But I did tell Edward no. He was pretty upset and he came back a week later and proposed to me again. I told him I'd have to think about it again. It's hard to have so much faith in us when you're so far away. What if I catch elephantitis when you're gone? - Ah, oh! Or what if I say no to every suitor that comes my way and you come home in love with a Tongan princess? Anyway, you shouldn't be thinking of me right now. You should be thinking of the people of Tonga. You should be serving them with all of your heart and reserving only the tiniest corner of it for me. I think I love you. I think I'll tell Edward no. If not, I'll definitely invite you to the wedding. Love, Jean. - Asi? - Yes, Kolipoki? - Your daughter, Mele. Why is she so quiet? - She is not my daughter. Her mother was a bad woman that ran around with my husband before he was baptized. I've taken her as my own and tried to love her. But an island is a small place to escape one's heritage. She punishes herself for the sins of her father. Kolipoki. The minister has told his people your feet are God's punishment for preaching the false doctrine. You must show your faith now, pray for your feet. In three days' time we will prove them wrong. Dear Jean. I think I've finally found the way to keep Edward from being so hot to trot. Please send him on the next boat to Tonga. I've got just the treatment for him. - Today we would like to teach you about God's plan of happiness. What? What's wrong? - Our minister told us to stop taking your lessons. - I see. - But it is okay if we keep feeding you. - Shouldn't we bless it first? Okay if I say it? Dear father in heaven, we thank thee this day for this wonderful family. We thank thee for all our blessings, especially for thy marvelous plan of happiness for thy children. We thank thee for thy son, Jesus Christ, who lived and died that someday we might return to live with thee again. We thank thee for the knowledge that through thy plan of happiness, our families can live together forever. We are grateful for thy wonderful plan of happiness and for this wonderful family who prepared us this wonderful meal. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Amen. - Please pass the octopus. - That was a lovely prayer, Kolipoki. - Next time I'll say it. - Thank you for dinner. - At least I know one of you enjoyed it. - Very good, Kolipoki. Better late than never, huh? - Leave the Mormons to me! - Hey Tomasi. Why did you help us? - Many years ago I was an orphan on the big island. Missionaries like you took care of me and put me in school. They were kind to me. Then I moved here, there were no missionaries, so I forgot about the church. Until tonight, when the minister asked us to rough-up the Mormons, I remember something. I am one! To Tomasi, the Mormon. - Ready? - Set, go! Come on, slow poke! Hey! - Hey, let's go on a picnic, huh? - To the back side. - Hey Noli. - Help me, Elder! I hurt my ankle. - Oh boy. This would never happen in Idaho! - Come with me. - Nia, Lavania we cannot do this. - But I thought you like me. - I do like you. - Then how can you reject me? Am I not pretty enough? - Oh, you're plenty pretty. - Then come, let's make love. - Come with me to the beach. And we can talk of love, a kind that never ends. - We will talk of love? - Yeah, true love. More than this. - Oh, wait, wait for me. Dear John. I went on a picnic yesterday with Edward. He tried to get all mushy, ugh. You're so lucky you don't have to worry about stuff like that. - Hey Tomasi. Tomasi, we're here to take you to church. - The Mormons. You come to baptize me? - Yeah, sort of. - The pudding is all gone. - Yes, I noticed. - Well then. - What's wrong, Noli? What's bothering you? - You say you love us and are trying to help us, but you think you're too good for my daughter? Isn't she pretty enough for you? - Your daughter is very beautiful. - My husband offer you hundred of acres of our best land. We offer you our daughter. And still you turn up your nose at us. What do you want anyway? - Well, I guess-- - I'll make you a better offer. You do not even have to marry our daughter or live on our island. Just give us a half-white baby. And we will not say any more. Surely you cannot be so selfish as to not do that for us. - Well, it's not really a matter of-- - What is it then? Our brown skin? - I love your brown skin. - Are you too rich to share your seed with poor people like us? - My seed? It's not that simple. - It is not that complicated either. - I cannot share my seed until I am married, and I cannot be married until I'm no longer a missionary. - Take a day off then. There is not a man on this island who would not sell all he owns to spend one hour with my daughter. - Yes, yes and for that precise reason, she should save herself. That most beautiful part of herself for the man who will love her forever. Here, look at this. This is a picture of my true love. We want to be married for eternity when I return. So we promised that we would save that part of ourselves for each other. See how beautiful she is? - She is very beautiful. - She is keeping her promise to me. Do you think that I should break my promise to her? - Kolipoki, you must keep your promise. Go now, thank you for telling me. I will not bother you anymore. - Hey! - Fish for breakfast! Just like I promised you, eh? - Finau! - We're coming! - Get your hands off him! A beautiful white boat! From New Zealand! - There's a boat. - We only got room for three. - Please, these men have nothing you need. Please no more, these men will take all and give nothing in return. Dear God in heaven. - Mele. Mele! Please, don't do this thing, Mele. I've been where you're going, it's a place of darkness. Please, Mele, no! Mele please, forgive me my sins. Live a better life than me! Mele! * Amazing Grace * How sweet the sound * That saved a wretch * Like me * I once was lost * But now am found * Was blind but now * I see * Twas grace that taught * My heart to fear * And grace my fears relieved * How precious did * That grace appear * The hour I first believed - Lavania, having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, amen. - Amen. * Through many dangers * Toils and snares * I have already come * Grace has brought me safe thus far * And grace will lead me home - The missionaries, my son, they are here. It's what you wanted. - He has lockjaw. We can give him a blessing. - There will be none of your blessings in this house. - The boy is dying, it can only help. A light, you see a light? Go to it, Finau, greet the light. - He comes to me. - We must go now. - We just got here. - The air grows heavy. - It's always heavy. - Not like this. We must find a place to hide. - Hide? - We must go now. - My girl, I couldn't find my girl! - Look out! Lita, where are you? - There she is! - Lita, let's go! - Run Feki, let's go! - Look out! - Lita! - Papa! - Mele. - We have been through this before, and we can make it again. Harvest all the fruits from the fallen trees, and get all the fruit grubs from out of the ground. - What about the telegraph? - Broken in the storm. But a boat should be along in two weeks. If we ration our food for four, we will be alright. Minister, could you please lead us in prayer? - Certainly. Dear Father, our father in heaven. We come before you on our little island and pray that you will show us mercy. We are small, but we are strong and we love you. We are thankful so many of us have survived this great storm. Father, we know that this storm rages on elsewhere and we pray for those in its path, particularly those who might be tossed on the waves of the sea. Please, care for them as you have cared for us. Amen. Amen. - You must come, quickly! - Mele. Dear God, Mele. - Amen. I cut, you choose. Come on, you took the smaller half. - I am the smaller person. - You want some? - No thanks. - You really think the boat'll be here in two weeks? - I don't know, Kolipoki. I don't know. Still no boat in sight and no fish either. The water in the lagoon is still bad. Ready for lunch? - Sure. - Better to have little than to have none. Dear John. It's been six weeks since your last letter, and as much as I hate to admit it, You've got me worried. After all you've told me about Feki though, I know you're in good hands. I hope he's taking good care of you. Dear Jean. I don't know if I'll be alive when you receive this letter. My strength is all but gone and I frequently find myself in a setting other than the one in which we live. It's beautiful there, and my visits reassure me that whether I live or die, it doesn't matter much. Funny as it may sound, my only regret is not having you here with me. I would die with your hand in mine clasped tightly to make it clear we will not be separated. Assuming, of course, you haven't married Edward already. Jean? I've learned things in the last few weeks that are difficult to express. There is a connection between heaven and earth. Finding that connection makes everything meaningful, including death. Missing it makes everything meaningless, including life. Please do all you can to comfort Mom and Dad. I am only now beginning to understand the love of a parent for a child. Dear John. It's been three months since your parents or I have heard from you. Are you alright? What do you see? - I see, I see a light. - Go to it John. Greet the light. - It comes to me. - Kolipoki? I want you to have this. I am old and must soon die. This storm has hurt me. But you are young and can yet do much good. Please, eat my jam and live. And please forgive me my trespasses against you. I didn't know you. I was afraid. Of all God's creations, his children are his greatest glory and you serve God's children with all your heart. - Kolipoki, Kolipoki, there is a boat. We are saved. Let's go. - You go ahead. I'll stay here. - I will go and bring you back food. - Hey we have a new mission president. - Yes? - Yeah, he wants me to be district president. He wants us to start a school and to start preaching in the outer islands. Wants me to call two counselors. And for you. - To go back to construction? - It's hard to leave, brother. - Yes, very hard. I have a gift for you. - Finau's pearl. You must keep it to remember him by. - You must keep it to remember me. - No, it is enough I remember you offered it to me. I must go now Kolipoki. I will build all your chapels, and you will fill them, Kolipoki. Hurrah for Israel! - Hurrah for Israel! - For Israel! - Hurrah! - So, why do I keep hearing about stolen coconuts? And girls, immorality? You are my counselors, counsel with me. - They are the privileges of the upper class. - Privileges, what privileges? - Your neighbor's coconuts. - Your neighbor's wife. - Not within the church. - It is the way things are done here. I am a copper farmer. In order to feed my family, I need my copper to be given the highest prices. To ensure this is so, I take my daughter to visit the governor once a week. That is before I met you and repented. - Now he gives him a bottle of fine liquor. You give him liquor? - Every Friday, for the weekend. - Tomasi, you know that is against our religion. - Drinking liquor is against our religion. Giving it is an act of charity. - Yeah? Well I forbid you from doing it again. - You what? - I said I forbid you from giving alcohol again. You're my counselor! I need you to set a better example. Tomasi, where are you going? We have a trip tomorrow! - You just don't understand, Kolipoki. - I must set a better example. - Yeah, yeah! - I have been thinking. You prayed for a tailwind. Perhaps there are others at sea praying for a headwind. We should make it possible for God to bless both by praying only for good wind. - We'll each say our own. - Get in. To make it by sundown we must go now. - Make it where? - There is a family that wants to hear the gospel. We have an errand from the Lord. Get in. - Stay the night there. We will have wind by the morning. Take this with you. - Why are you doing this? - I didn't decide to serve the Lord until I was old and tired. Tired from all the sin. You, you are young and already give your life to him. I cannot be young again, but today I can be the Lord's wind. Papa, Papa, they came like they promised! Dear John. The islands, the people there sound wondrous. You sound wondrous too. I can almost feel you stretching. It's hard to imagine how I could possibly keep up. You don't need to keep up, you just need to be you. I'm getting ready to graduate. I'll probably end up teaching school somewhere. I wish you could teach school here. Can you hear them, Jean? Can you hear the children singing? All my love to you. - Kolipoki, your president is here. - Oh, hello. You must be the new president. I didn't expect you. - I'm on my way to Vava'u. Our boat stops here for the night. - Oh, so pleased to meet you. Will you be staying here? - No, I have a room down in the village. I haven't heard much from you, I was hoping you could give me a report on your activities. - Oh certainly, certainly. Well, I believe we're doing what you asked. The school is growing, we're traveling to the outer islands preaching and baptizing. - Who have you baptized? - Well, we baptized Vika, Hale, Pita. - I have no records of them. Nor do I have any reports of your work here. - There's been lots of work, I didn't know-- - When you baptize someone, you are supposed to fill out a baptismal record. You are also supposed to send weekly reports telling me what you've done. For all I know you could have been vacationing here for the last two years. - Well no one ever asked me about any reports. Except for the branch president in Filimea. - We don't have a branch in Filimea. - Oh yes, we have a good strong branch of 32 members. And a nice chapel too. - Who authorized you to build a branch in Filimea? Who authorized you to build a chapel? - Well it's just that we've been baptizing so many people. - Where did you get the money? Whose land is it built on? - I don't know whose property it's built on, but everyone in Filimea knows. - Everyone in Filimea, but no one in my office. Elder Groberg. The house of the Lord is a house of order. There are forms for these things. - Forms. President! President Stone! These are the baptisms, the priest ordinations, the branches we organized, and the chapels we built. I'm really sorry that I didn't know about the forms. - Elder Groberg, I've been up all night worrying about what I said yesterday. It looks like you have been too. I've never seen a happier bunch of saints anywhere on earth. You just keep doing what you're doing. Oh, and another thing. I'd like to extend your mission six months. - Sounds great. - I'll be putting two new chapels in your district. Seeing as they're going to be made of concrete, you probably should purchase the land. - Okay. - Kuli, we have a visitor! - It is wrong to stow away. - Yes. - Now swim home, and hurry up about it. - Okay. - You know my parents left me once at a gas station. We're just driving around the block, right? - How will he learn if I give in? - Kuli, what about sharks? Leg cramps? - He is my son. He will be alright. - Cut the sail, cut the sail now! - I got it! - Help me pull it! - Get the sail, Tomasi! - Kuli! - Kuli! Tomasi! Dear John. I am thrilled to hear about your new assignment, although I am sure it is sometimes overwhelming. I felt that way when I finished school and took my first job down here in Anaheim. My friends were all back in Utah, my family in North Hollywood. Here I have only my students, and lots of time to think of you. Are you well, John? Are you safe? Do you have time to think of me, or are you completely lost in the Lord's work? The scriptures say you find your life by losing it, and as much as I miss you, I encourage you on in that quest. Lose yourself, John. Every last bit of yourself. Then, when you come home, I'll know I'm in love with the version of you God intended. - He's over there! - Kuli! - Kolipoki! Over here, over here! Swim Kolipoki! Kolipoki! - Some time God calm the storm, sometime he calm the sailor. - And sometimes he just leads us to him. - I'm so sorry, Kolipoki. - Something for me. You wanna tell me what it says? - I don't know, it's confidential. Dear Elder Groberg, stop. Request for extension denied by Salt Lake, stop. Boat to New Zealand, airplane to Los Angeles next week, stop. Leave island as soon as possible, stop. - Thank you for the school, Kolipoki. - You're welcome. Thank you for behaving. - Yes. - We have a gift for you, Kolipoki. - Burial clothes? - From Salt Lake. - They asked us to keep them with you at all times but not tell you. - We are happy we did not need to use them. - Thank you, so am I. - We have another surprise for you, Kolipoki. A fiery horse with the speed of light a cloud of dust and a hearty hi ho silver! The Lone Ranger! Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. Dear John. I wish-- You could see what I see. I see. - Tomasi. - You took care of me. * God be with you 'til we meet again * By his councils guide uphold you * With his sheep securely fold you * God be with you 'til we meet again * - Your body may leave us, but your spirit will always remain on our island. - Goodbye, Kolipoki. - How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet. - Remember true love. - Eternal love. - That's right. Dear Jean. It finally happened. I am coming home. - President Stone. - Elder Groberg. Funny though, feels more like I'm leaving home. For the past three years I've lived among a people who possess nothing, yet possess everything. - John! In this life they sail the oceans, in the next they will sail the skies. I wish to be more like them. Boatmen among the stars. And I wish to have you with me. Your softness at my side. Oh, Jean. Jean, Jean. Will you love me across the sky?
