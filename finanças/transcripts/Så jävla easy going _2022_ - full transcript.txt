Oh, shit. Fuck, sorry. I don't know. It just comes out. It's cool. It just sounds like you forgot to feed your fish. My fish? -Yeah, sort of. Sorry. I'll keep it in mind. No, whatever... Keep going. It's fine, fantastic. Oh, shit. Fuck. Don't you want to stay for a snack? No, I'm fine. I've got some things... I need to get home. Bye. If it's because of this, then forget it. I can do It later. -Okay. No... I just wanted to get rid of the last of it... or try to. Adding a new product line? You mean the condoms? No, I got them at work. They were about to expire. Nice. I still have to go. But good luck with your fuck-athon. See you. Bye. Joanna, I thought... You can have these. What? -I don't need all of them, all those condoms, since l... like, only do it with you. Okay. -I also thought that you might need them more... to use with someone else, with other guys... Sure you're not hungry? I'm fine. Thanks for these. I'll be going. See you. Don't forget to feed your fish. I won't. Bye. Valhalla Pool. This is Sandros. REMINDER: GET MEDS Your last two prescriptions weren't covered. Okay. They're supposed to be. It doesn't look like they were. It shows 1,530 kronor in unpaid bills. Okay. Are you sure there's nothing wrong with your computer? Your internet? No, I don't think so. Okay, so what do we do? I can't issue any additional invoices until these are paid. But I need my medication. I'm sorry... -But I really need it. I understand, but... -No, you don't understand. I get these flashes in my brain. I really need to take it. I'm a total wreck without it. I can really... It kind of... My brain just... It just... Please. I really need it. Sorry, I can't help you. Hello. Hey! Hi. -Hi. Are you winning? -Yes, all correct so far. That's good. The category is "Pigs." For A, I'm looking for the famous boar from Norse mythology. It comes to 64 kronor. Okay, we can take these off. It's fine. Just take them off. It's not that time of the month yet, so... Okay. 41 then. Moving on to the next category: Spain. Who wouldn't want to be there right now? I went to the pharmacy today to get my ADHD medication. -That's good. Mhm. Only... the guy at the pharmacy said that I couldn't have it, because there were too many unpaid prescriptions. Oh, right. -It's cool. I just thought... Can we sort it out now? Yes, but... Do you think you have enough to last a little longer?... Until the 25th? Everyone will hate me. -Hey, Jojo... they won't. You're the best. You know that. Sorry. As soon as I get my next... -It's okay. I'll be fine. 60 kronor Is cheap as shit. I've got lots to choose from. Maybe this is your thing. Beyond Thin. -Beyond Thin? What? You think I have a thin dick? No, it just means that the rubber is thin, and it's tight, which might be good. I don't need some tight-fitting... Do you really think I have a thin dick? -Kinda. You keep going on about it. Stop messing around and take them. -Okay. Shoot me 60 kronor. Thanks. Bye. What? What "what"? You're giving me a funny look, as if it was weird. Am i? Yes. It's not weird... in case you're wondering. -I wasn't. No? Okay, fine. -Mm. Never mind. I'm not following you. I'm just going this way. Yeah, I realized that. I'm not even going this way, so... -Thanks. I was selling condoms... nothing weird. It wasn't drugs or anything. Okay. Drugs might have been less weird though. I thought we'd do a speech exercise. Spread out and work In pairs, five minutes at a time, like a speed date in German. Okay? Off you go. Is this space free? Yes. Okay. A speed date. Fun. Fun. A speed date. -'Joanna, in German, please.' Yes, sorry. 'My name Is Joanna. And you? 'My name is Audrey. Nice to meet you.' 'You too.' Okay, so what kind of person are you? Me? -Mhm. Eh. 'I... I'm...' 'I don't know.' Or something. Okay. -You went straight in there. It kind of makes you... -Joanna. 'I am a...' What's the damn word? Next 'question', please. Nice. Is that an anti-stress thing? No, It's... 'It's a... gift.' From... It's from Mum. Well, actually... 'In German', yes. 'My name is Joanna, and...' 'and...' I think i'll... I'm just going to pee. But you also have a chance to win big... I'm selling some old stuff from storage. Is that okay? Thanks. What's wrong with these? The food processor is like brand new. Used once, maybe twice. It's a juicer. Like I said, we're not interested. You're sending mixed messages. When I came in, you stared at them. Yes, because they're strange things to bring in here. We buy mostly jewelry. If you have any, we can look at it. No, I don't. Then I'm afraid I can't help you. Here's your change. Thanks. Have a nice evening. Hello. -Hi. So, you work here. Yep. Great. And you? Looking for a nice ski slope? You need plenty of time to find some good powder. That's right. -Powdery snow, not drugs. I don't do... It's not my... I won't bother you any more. I just saw you and thought I'd say hi. Hello! Hello. Bye. Hey. I'm going out for a smoke. Okay. Do you want to join me? Okay. Do you you live near here? -Mm. Sort of. And you? -Sort of. Okay. I never saw you at school before. -No, I moved here last spring. My parents got divorced, so I moved with my mum. It was like, "one or the other." I had to pick one. I get it. -And you? Do you live with both your parents? I was thinking that you weren't in German class last year. No. I moved here in the spring. Just a sec. Hi. No, I'm at work. I finish at eleven. Yes, the swimming pool on Saturday. Did I write that, yeah? Yes. Okay. Uh, no. Valhalla, half past one. Great. I need to go. Perfect. Kisses. See ya. Sorry. I must have had too much coffee. Okay. That's pretty. What? You've got like a little triangle here. It's pretty. Mum and Dad used to say that It looks like a constellation. They used to say that. Dot, dot, dot. A constellation? Weren't we supposed to smoke? -Sure. Have any smokes? No. Do you? -No. I don't smoke. Do you? No, I thought... Yeah... I should go back In. -Yeah. Thanks for coming out to smoke. -Thanks. I will... Don't forget your skis. -No. Thanks. Yeah. Okay! Yep. Yeah, sorry. Sorry, you asshole! Exactly. I sent an email yesterday. A job application. I just thought... Yes. Yeah, you might say I'm new to the game. No. Okay. Yes, I get it. Thanks. Yes, but that's a bit tricky for me. How can I gain experience if I don't get a chance? Yes. Yes, I understand, but I realized that I do have experience. No. No, I'm not lying. Yes. Yes. Thanks, you old fuck. Bye. Hi, how's it going? Hi. Great. Fine. I'm going out with some friends. Wanna join us... if you're not busy? I think I'm doing someone else. Something. I'm doing something else. But thanks. -Oh, okay. I'll start by asking you which snake species is the longest in Sweden? Daddy... How about we go for a walk, you and me? Oh? I thought we could go see Mum. Yeah... I don't know, but... I feel a bit... Another time, Jojo. Definitely. How's it going? Any news? Anything fun going on? It looks like shit here. Valhalla Pool. This is Sandros. Hello? Here you are. -Exactly. I was just in there. It's a toilet. That's why I was there. Okay. This is Joanna. -Hi. I'm Mikaela. Elsa. -Hi. So, are you also going for a swim? No, it's just full of piss and band-aids in there. Yeah, it's pretty disgusting. So what are you here for? -We're going to the sauna. Oh. I love the sauna. Sometimes it's her fault, not yours. She's just chosen to do it. You all right?? Sure. It's just so damn hot, but it's supposed to be. Audrey, Elsa says you're not coming tonight. I'm working. -Stop it! All you have to do is make one call and someone will cover for you. Come on. -Maybe. That's a "yes." Do you want to come? Me? -Mhm. Yeah. Yes. Oh. Shit. Sorry, I have to... So, you swim. Mum and I used to swim, not seriously though. It looked pretty serious. Well, no... Do you do it often? No, not any more. Have you finished in the sauna? -No, I'm going back in again, but it felt wrong not to ask you, since you love the sauna. I think I'll stay here a bit longer. Thanks anyway. Okay. I didn't think you liked this water. Yeah, but where else am I supposed to pee? I'll join you for a couple of lengths. Why do both need to know? -Both don't need to know. What? Why not? Safe-sex orgy coming up? No, I... My fuck buddy gave them to me. My friend... He works In a warehouse. -Like, "thanks for the lay"? No, he just gave them to me. After sex? It happened once. I don't know. Audrey, you decide. Joanna gets condoms from her fuck buddy after they have sex. Isn't that a bit... Guess it depends... I don't know. It wears you out, the sauna and everything. It makes you feel a bit... in your head. Exactly. -But... I was thinking about this evening. I think I'm working after all. Oh, okay. Yeah, I need the money. Yes, work and money are important. Work, work all the time. Or maybe not all the time. I don't have your schedule. Maybe I'll see you in class. -Sure. Yeah. Bye. Hello. Hi. -The correct answer is A... HI, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? Hi. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Are you sure it's okay if I... Sure, go ahead. Yeah. I thought you sold it all. Well, I'm about to. I don't want my folks finding it. It's all in my locker, but there's a guy who's buying all of it, so that's good. Hey... Is it okay If I stay for a bit? Yes. Yeah, sure. We could watch a movie or something, if you like. Okay. Anything you like? Could you lend me 2,000 kronor? No. No... Sorry. I could ask my mum. Thanks, but... It's really... Forget I said it. It's nothing. Do you have any wine? -Yes. Why don't you pick a film while I go downstairs and... MATHEUS GUSTAVSSON: AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. DON'T WANT IT IN MY LOCKER. JENS NYSTROM: OK! THURSDAY WORKS. 4000 IN TOTAL. CENTRAL STATION? CENTRAL STATION? No wine, I have coffee liqueur and rum, if that's okay? Yes, that's fine. OK! THURSDAY WORKS. 4,000 IN TOTAL. CENTRAL STATION? We can mix some drinks. Sure. Perfect. You're all red. Why don't you take it off? Oh. No, it's okay. Sorry, I didn't mean to. -No, I just... But I'm going to... the bathroom. Want to meet up tomorrow? Definitely. Maybe. We'll see. I'm off now, but don't forget to feed your fish, and I'll see you soon. Bye. -Bye. Here you go. Have a nice evening. -Thanks. Hi. Have a nice evening. Hi there. Hello. You smell of booze. -I shouldn't say this, but I've got a gun in my pocket, so you'd better listen to me. Let's do something. It'll be fun. Can you step aside? Please, come on. Let's do something. It'll be fun. Let's go. Come on. Don't make me use this. You smiled. That means yes. Come on. Thomas, can I leave a bit early? Oh. Have a nice evening. -Thanks, Thomas. Okay, so what's the plan? The plan is... It's a bit fuzzy right now. I didn't have time to think of anything, but give me a bit of time... -Hang on. There. Okay, let's park this. Hi, can I have one with cinnamon and sugar, please? Want one? No. No, I'm fine. And another one. Hi! Bye. Are you okay? -Yeah. Good. Sorry. -It's fine. No one is home. What the hell? -Don't tear down the house. So... What kind of person are you? What? Hey, what's up? -Nothing. I'm just... NOTIFICATION OF TRANSFER 2,000 KRONOR FROM MATHEUS MATHEUS: HI, HOW ARE YOU TODAY? THANKS FOR THE MONEY! WILL PAY YOU BACK SOON. WE NEED TO TALK. WEIRDEST THING. I'M OUTSIDE. COULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR? Fuck! Sorry, I got locked out. I just need to get back in. Can't you come open up? If you open the door, I can get in. Come on. PHARMACY SUNDAY: CLOSED Hello. What are you doing out here? I needed some air and got stuck outside. Why aren't the lights working? I... I was a bit late, but I'll sort it out. It's just... -How much is it? What? How much is it? Maybe I can chip In. No, no. Jojo, it... Forget it. I'll deal with it. Are you hungry? I can make you some sandwiches. Exactly. 1,500. I paid it earlier today, so It should be fine. When does the electricity come back on? Okay. Fine. Thank you. Bye. Is everything okay? -Super. I was thinking about this evening. Have any plans? Maybe. Sorry? Or, what? There's a film club at school. I thought it might be fun. Hello? -Hello. Thank you, that's fine. Hi. How's it going? -Fine. You didn't reply yesterday, so I just wanted to make sure you were okay. I'm fine, like I said. You seemed a little... It felt a bit... On Saturday. Well... I've got to... Did you get the money? -Yes. Thank you. It's cool. There's no rush. I'm getting paid soon. Good. You don't want to have another go with that movie night? I could cook, or we could get take-out... Stop it, please. Please, just stop it. I don't know what you're thinking, but this isn't a thing. I thought... -You thought wrong. It's nothing. Can you just stop? Please? Okay. Yesterday was a bit messed up. -Okay. I got locked out and stuff and had to throw pebbles up and shit. Okay. Yeah, so... You could have texted to say that you were leaving. I know. I'm sorry. I got fried. My phone, I mean. It's like I'm constantly thinking of drugs. It's not like that. So it's all good. Oh, yeah. This is yours. Thanks. Good to see that you're alive. JENS NYSTROM: 4.000 IN TOTAL. CENTRAL STATION? ...LOCKER... You know that there's a 150 kronor charge for a lost key. Yes, I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot. What's your locker number? -5073. Is your name Matheus? Yes, it's my middle name. No, we swapped lockers like three weeks ago. It should say that. It doesn't. These things need to be done through me. I spoke directly to the principal, and she said it was fine. What the hell... Hi, sweetheart. -Hi. I thought I'd sort out the hallway. There's so much stuff everywhere. Okay. Nice. CREATE NEW ACCOUNT WHAT'S YOUR NAME? MATHEUS GUSTAVSSON HI, NEW MAIL. HAD TO CHANGE IT. CAN WE DO IT EARLIER? SEND Hello. -Hello. About the electricity... I feel so stupid that you should... -No, don't worry about it. It's not a problem. Right... So how's school and stuff? Sorry? Have you had a good day? Was your day okay? -Dad, I've got some things to sort out. Sure, I understand. Of course. It was good, thanks. I've got things to sort out too... in the hallway. There's so much junk.

Really. But tell me, because this is so bizarre. I want to. It's just that... I had to get something. Condoms? Yes. Yes, exactly. From your fuck buddy? -No. He's not my fuck buddy. We're... Yeah, sorry. -You can do whatever you want. I just don't want to go around feeling awkward. No, no. Hello, I get it. Of course. Sorry. I'm really not trying to put any pressure on you. But it is a bit like that. -Why? Because I want to get to know you? -No, that's what I want, too. Do you? -Yes, I do. You keep making excuses, and then you disappear. You're completely shut off. No, I'm not. -Yes. No. -Yes. As soon as I ask you something, you go completely... I don't know. Exactly, you don't know. If I ask how you are, you go totally off. It's like I asked if you want to join the Nazis, or something. No, it's not like that. Go on, ask me something. Okay. -Anything. What do your parents do for a living? They... um... You can ask anything and you pick that. At least the Nazi question was out of the box. Sure. What are you so afraid of that I'm going to find out? I don't get it. You don't have to answer. I don't know. You couldn't put up with me. Why not? I just know that you couldn't put up with me. That's the way it is. I know it. This is what I can't put up with. See you at German, or something. JENS: OK. TOMORROW. 16:00 AT CENTRAL STATION. JENS: LOCKER A07. CODE 326781485 Sorry, we're closed. Really? But it feels open. Only the exit is open for the last customers. Then I'll be the last. -Sorry. Come back tomorrow. But I'm here now. Can't I just get my meds? Come back tomorrow. We're closed. I know you're just doing your job, but I need my medication.

Come back tomorrow. -You said that 300 times already. Is that your fucking slogan? -The same way you entered, please. The exit. -Yeah, I know! Why do you even have two doors? It's fucking stupid. I called you. - I must have missed it. Hey. I get worried. -Worried? Of course. Is there any food? What is it? -What do you think? Suddenly, you're the one worrying. -Of course I worry. Great! Then you know what it's like for me not knowing if I'll find you in front of the TV or dangling from a fucking rope. Sweetheart. It's great that you're feeling better, but it's always like this. You get better, and then you're back on the couch again. I can't cope. Well... Jojo, I'm not well. Neither am I. We're all sick. I have a fucking light show in my head. Fuck... She's lying out there. She's out there all alone, and you just sit on that damn couch. What would she have said? She would have hated it. You know that. Hey... You buttoned your shirt lopsided. CAN WE TALK? AUDREY:... CAN I CALL? AUDREY: PLEASE DON'T. PHARMACY My parents don't work. My mum Is dead, and my dad has depression and can't do anything. And I have ADHD... like super intense too. I don't like to talk bout it, because then it feels like that's all I am. I've been without medication for days. It's been awful. And I... feel like a fucking idiot for being such an ass. The thing about "what kind of person I am..." I didn't really want to answer that, because... I don't know. I don't like that person. But... I like you... a lot. It's really nice and really scary, and I hate the fact that I fucked this up, because I don't want to do that. Yeah... Awkward, but I knew it would be... I'm gonna... do something over there. See you. Bye. Okay, guys. Split up into pairs like last time. Hi. Hello. 'So, what did you do this weekend?' 'Weekend,' is that right? I don't know. Maybe. -Well... AUDREY: AWKWARD. I DON'T WANT TO BE SHUT OFF. I'M OPEN. 10 CENTIMETERS OPEN. JOKING. DISGUSTING. BUT YOU GET IT. 'What did you do this weekend.' -Hold on. One moment. WANNA MEET UP LATER? AT YOUR PLACE? Okay. 'What did you do this week...' We just want to talk. -Yeah. Go ahead. Talk. I'm in the middle of class... -Don't. Do you think I'm stupid? You took our stash. Where is it? Where is it? -Hey... I want my money back. Okay? -Yes. Take it easy. What is this? Fuck. Do you hear me now? Tomorrow. Hello. Where's the plastic bag that was under my bed? Why? -Where's the bag? I need it. Wasn't it trash? Sorry. I didn't think... Hello. So what do we do? I don't know. I didn't plan for it to be like this. -You accidentally opened my locker and stole my stuff? No. No. Hey... I can fix this. How? Maybe I can talk to him. Don't do anything. I'll sort it out. Right. Thanks. I don't want you to contact me again. Hello. -Hi. Sorry, I'm late. I needed to help my Dad with something, and it all got really rushed. Did something happen? No, it's just... Like I said, sorry I'm late... I really didn't want you to... What's happened? It... It's just... a whole load of shit. Hey... I thought that... maybe we should go for a little walk? Mmm. Look who's here. Hi there. Jojo, I don't know if I... Sorry. He's a bit nervous. Sorry. Sorry I haven't been here, and that... Well, you know. I miss you. We miss you. But... Jojo keeps an eye on me, so it's all right. Hi. Bye. -Wait. Wait, wait. Ow! Fucking shoe. It's like a sock. I know I'm not supposed to turn up like this, But I wanted to... Here. It's 2,150 kronor. It's not all of it, but it's what I have now. The rest of it is on its way. -Great. Wait. Seriously... Sorry. I'm sorry I've been an asshole to you, and not just about this. Before as well. Sorry. Ouch. I shouldn't have put my shoe in... If you want, I have skis and a juicer back home that you can have, as a bonus, I thought. Right... I'll be heading... off now. Thanks. It's okay. Thank you. Bye. -Bye. -Don't forget to feed your fish. - I have no fish, Joanna. Okay? Okay. Bye. -Bye. How do I look? Like you've been riding on the back of a bike. Is that better? Much better. Okay, so what would you say? What kind of person am I? My kind of person. Off you go! And good luck. -Thanks. Do you have any work experience? No, I wouldn't say so. Okay. None at all? I worked a bit in sales. I sold some con... some personal hygiene products. Then I dabbled a bit In natural remedies, like plants and stuff. -Okay. That sounds like something. Yes. Audrey recommended you wholeheartedly. She's said you're easy to get along with, and that you are... "so damn easy going." Did she say that? -Yes. You don't agree? Yes, I do. I agree.
