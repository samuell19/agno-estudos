I said my own planet. At night, that's up there..I can see my home. We're suprised when we learned that.. There are another world, people just like us. So they sent me here, for research purpose. But when I just got here. Someone snatched my remote control. And without remote control I cant give signals to my home. Without signals, no one can come and take me home.. How'd I tell them that its a dangerous world here, we cant survive here. Hello... Listen. What ..? - Open the door please. I want to go home. Madam, that can be decide by party from outside, not from inside. Look I'm not a thief. - Thats what thieves always said. Where Mr. Pandit? Please call him. - Mr. Pandit went on patrol. Mr. Pandit. - Pandit. - Hey thief, shut up. Or I'll give.. You think I'm crazy, talking nonsense? If not then what? Your planet people talking like Bujpur? Our world did not have any language... We all are talking with mind, never arouse confussion. But here, say something else but meant something else. One word but four meaning. When saying something good, its like... Everything is good, very good. "accha" with big eyes.. When in wonder, the tone is short... "Your mother accident ... Really?" When someone angry, the tone sound even more high. "Really? You want to teach me? Really?" When thinking, then its long tone. "Oh, that's it...." You have to pay close attention. Then one can understand what they mean. Because of so many confussion, I had to learn it in full six hours Meaning you learned all Bujpuri language in just six hours? -I cant touch hands at that time. Then I met one girl, I sit together with her.. I hold her hands and transfer all the language she has to me. Do you have a laughing brain? There's a limit to everything you know. Is your hands is like a USB cable? That can transfer files from computer to another computer? And your clothes ..? Your world's also wearing jeans? No no no .. .. Our world's don't wear any clothes. First time I got here, I think that people's here different from each other Our world different by the skin, the skin here... Some have shining bright skin, some have black skin. Some have colours skin, some have plain skin. Some have a skinny skin and some have hanging down skin. Then one day I saw a car. Dancing car. Then I understood, that people's bodies here is the same as my world. The difference here is that they all are wearing something that fashion over their body. Now I can mix into the crowd. But I dont know why all these people are laughing at me. After that, I understood that men's clothes is different and women's clothes is different. Day's clothes different and night's clothes different. Playing's clothes is different. Eating's clothes is different. Within my clothes I found a kind of photo. I slowly realize that this photo is important to survive in this world. That if I give this photo, I can get food to eat. So I started to collect pictures of this old man. What man ... Why do you give me these ..? This for bookstore, man.. Yess..right.. here is your carrots. Now I realize that this picture is useful in one paper only. The other papers, the photo is useful for nothing. Now the need for money and clothes I will always get from the dancing car. It is my bank, and it is also my tailor. There's one time, I got a strange clothes.. Where I dont need to show any picture or photo.. And the food comes to me on its own. Mr. take this. I realized that if I want to find my remote control I have to learn this world language. Without language, no work can be done here. Just like the man that I want to tell that his style has some defect in my opinion. I have a feeling that I've damaged his fashion. Here, let me correct it just the way it was. I met him down the road. Some rascals hit him and runaway. The mind's not good. He didn't respond anything. Maybe he is deaf? Oii..! He hear. but give no answers. It looks like a firm's hit in the head. Its memory lost. Memory gone. Do you remember who hits you? Remember car plate number? Remember anything? Something? Let's go brother. Come with me. As long as your memory don't come back to you you will be my guests. They say to cure memory lost.. Go to where your memory lost.. And you can get it back. I've seen it in film. What's he talking.. Its important to understand now.. I need to hold his hand and transfer his language to me. The name of the car is ... Memory gone, and now can't differentiate man from woman? Hold on a sec. Look at my driver's license. Gender. Male. Man. Human. Rascal, Bastard If I want to go back to my home.. I definitely have to catch someone's hand. Mate, I met colourful friend He is a strange man Mate, I met colourful friend He is astrange man You've been hard for us boy. Do not do it..so.. The boy has truely become my guest .. The boy has truely become my guest .. I can understand your pain, brother. But don't openly hold hands. Although it's a beautiful thing, but it can be life threatening too. You can wait no longer. Come, come with me. Here if you graps anyone hands, or legs, no one will kill you. Come here, come on ... This is a good place. Here they are very nice and pretty. Everyone inside was willing to take my hand and take me home. And then I've met a gentle girl.. who has peace of mind. Puljaria Puljaria, take him to the honeymoon room. Puljaria was sitting there with patience. In the meantime, I.. Over six hours ... Took her language into my body. Pronunciation...X by J I took everything from her inside me. First time, you useless..? It's first step before the start, or what...? Yes. Where are you come from? I came from very far away. You have not even heard the name of it. But you talk like us. It's you who teach me .. SO I speak exactly like you, sister. Hey..sister become your mother! Go, get out from here. Brother.. Brother..wake up. Get up brother. Brother. You're talking, brother. I want your help, brother. What magic did Puljaria do to you? Come with me now. This memory has a direct connection to something. This thing we must tell the doctor, brother. And you can be cured. There is a very important job. Brother. Please come with me, hurry. Stop here. Stop here. Brother .. That day, the chain was taken from me here. I want that chain, brother. Is it precious? -Very much. Listen brother. The thief is from our village. But the chain must have reach Delhi. If you can trace where he sold it, you can capture him. So I have to go there, brother. - Where? Delhi. Sir... -What? My remote control has been stolen. Are you drunk? Is finding your remote TV a police job? It's not a TV remote control. -Then what? I can not say that. But it was fixed to a neck chain. And it's worth much more. Where did the theft happen? -At Mandawa. It's stolen in Mandawa.. And you come to Delhi to find it..? But the thief must have come to Delhi - So? So where can I find the thief? Hey wierdo. There are two million people in this city.. Policeman is human. Not God. Only God can help you. Hold God's two legs. He's the only one able to help you. Only God know. How can we know? God know where, get out. Have faith in the God, son. Who is this Bhagwan? That can help me. I see that everyone mentioned his name. After what I saw, I was freaked out. The people of this world.. Made Them as pictures... They themselves made a place for Him in one place. There are even streets in His house. Hundreds of thousands of people go to Him. He solve everyone's problems for a small amount of charges. This kind of magic didn't exist in my world. I could not believe it. But I thought I should try it once or twice. Give me a God, brother. Which one you want? This here is Rs.20..50..100..500.. What's the difference between Rs.20 and 500 ones? Only the size, everything else is the same. - The Rs.20's will work too, right? Ok, Rs.15 then.. O God, I am very hungry. Give me something to eat. I've become totally out of control. This God is working. Now I can go to my home. God, someone took my remote control. Please bring it back, I want to go home. Sir, is this God out of battery? I just used it once, then it broke. What do you mean..? -I mean, put a new battery in him. It doesnt need any battery -Then why this does not work..? Is it a defect one? -No, I made it perfect. Is it you who created this God? Yes, from my hands. Did you created God or did God created you? God created us all. But we make only His sculptures. Why create his sculptures? So that we can pray to Him. Tell Him about our joys and sorrows. There's been installed a communication device? How do we hear God say? God does not need any transmitter. He hear directly. If He hear directly, then whats the need for sculpture? What am I going to do with this man.. Trying to end our business, huh? What is Your problem? My remote control has been stolen. I asked God .. To tell me where it is. Are you Peekay? - What does that mean? Bro, this small God can not do something big like that.. He can't capture the thief, the legs is short. Go inside the temple. There is a big God. Catch his feet. He run very fast. Give Him this nuts and some money to him. Your job will be done. That will be Rs.200. Everyone was waiting for their turn carrying nuts and money. To make their work done. Two hours later, it was my turn. Oh God .. .. God..Give me back my remote control. B ... Where is it? - Hurry, please. Hold on, my remote control's not received yet. Sir..He's not getting the job done, I already gave money. You job will be done. - When will it be..? Who can say when my son? Your job will be done. Move it. -But when can I get my item? Do not hold the queue, Go ahead. - What if someone else get my item? Are you drunk? - Hold on, ma'am. What are you doing ..? But where can I get my goods? -You will find it in a mental hospital. What? Paid money here, and delivery at mental hospital? Get this man out! - Hey, at least give me receipt. Give me receipt so that I can ask the man when can I get delivery? Go on. Please go. - But..but my remote control. I can't find my sandals. Must be someone take it away. Wear someone else's sandals then. Thats what happen at temples anyway. Someone's take a full payment, but never did the job. Say his name. Bhagwan (God) - say the full name. Don't know his full name. Where'd he live? There, in front of the temple. You gave the money to his own hand? No, I put it in a box. He said that your job will be done? - He does not speak. Why? He's mute? - Maybe... Absolutely. - Right.. Tell me his appearance. He looks like this. Just the size is large. Come here..Come here ... .. Are you Peekay? (You're drunk?) Err..Yes, but how do you all know that? - Am I blind? 20 years of police work. Just by seeing I can tell who's drunk and who's not. Mr.Singh, search him. Give me his ID. Dr. D'Mello. Oh Dr. why did did you drink so much that you forgot your religion? You've mistaken between temple and church. You go to your church. To your own God. Church..? Get out of here. - But my item. Beat it. Get out. Because of you, God have been crossed. What? Nailed? God? When? - 2000 years ago. For your sins. But what did I do? I came here only just now. Are you PK?
