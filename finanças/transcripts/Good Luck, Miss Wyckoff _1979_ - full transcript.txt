[dog barking] [car departing] Evie, you really are a good girl. How was school today? Any exact news? No, Mr. Hemmings, just like every other day. Evie, now don't you go tell him about the movie. Stop it, you know you always had to be the first to tell. We're taking Mrs. Hemmings to the movies tonight. To see Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. Do you want to come along? Oh, no. That's why I spent the money on the TV so I won't have to go out. I am not sure to allow you girls to go out to see it. I here it's kind of risque. But it's Tennessee Williams Mr Hemmings. Hollywood. They'll find a way to turn it all around and put a lot of sex into it. Well, the whole play is about sex. I don't see how they could put any more in it. All I know is that Marlon Brando is the handsomest man in the whole world. And I'd go any place to see him, especially in a sexy part. Well, I don't know, you girls, going to see a sexy movie. Come on, Mr Hemmings, we're old enough. (Mrs. Hemmings) Don't bully my girls, Gilbert. We're going see Marlon Brando and Vivian Leigh and you can just sit here all you want. Come on, Evie. Good night, Mr. Hemmings. Good night, Evie. Do you think that Vivian Leigh really fell in love with Clark Gable? Now, there was a picture. It wasn't. Oh, I couldn't bear the sad ending. [school bell ringing] I predict that Street Car Named Desire will earn her another Oscar. Mildred, would you stop about Vivian Leigh? Now, Marlon Brando, there is a hunk. Did you see his body? Well, I thought he was coarse. Well, of course he is coarse, he's supposed to be coarse. But I tell you one thing. He could put his shoes under my bed any time. Oh! Am I right or am I right? He is an excellent actor. Actor?! I am talking about his sex. What did I say? I think you've lost your sense of humor. Sorry, Beth, I didn't sleep too well last night. Good morning, ladies. Good morning, Mr. Havermeyer. The crust of ash which formed the top layer of the tomb preserved Pompey from change by man or nature. At centuries past, the ancient city was forgotten until 1718 when a peasant found traces of the old city in his vineyard. Didn't they know it was there? Oh, no. It was a lost city for ages and ages. And here you can see some of the plastic casts of the people who died during the holocaust. That one surely looks like Alan. [laughing] Here is an inscription that you would probably see on a public building. And it is our Latin phrase for today. ?Saws Populi Lex Suprema Est? What does that mean? Alan? The healthy people are the most supreme? Close. It's a very wise saying, and it means "The welfare of the people, is the supreme law." When I took my trip to Italy last year, I saw mount Vesuvius. It was just as the sun was setting. And it was the most beautiful sight I've ever seen. I never saw her like that. [school bell ringing] Uh..assembly. Testing... one, two, three. Could you all be seated, please. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Boys and girls. As you know this is our last assembly program before the start of our Thanksgiving vacation. [applauding] [cheering] I know how sad you all are about that. We had a very special treat this morning. Mrs. Henry Blud, chairman of the music department has arranged the program of the musical selections to be performed by some of our most gifted pupils. [applauding] [applauding] The first selection will be played by Billy Calvin. He will perform the Adagio in B Minor by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. [applauding] [Waving piano] [yawning] [whispering] He's my favorite. I've always thought so. [sobbing] What do you think? [dramatic musical theme] [knocking on door] Evie. Yes. Are you alright? I am too sick to go to school today. Would you please ask Mr Havermeyer if he could get a substitute teacher? Oh, sure. I hope you feel better. See you later, kid. [crickets] [clock ticking] I can't sleep. What is happening to me? [crying] Evie! [knocking on door] I am alright. Please, leave me alone. Please, leave me alone! Please. Oh, I wish... I wish I was dead. Could I speak to Dr. Neal, please. Evelyn Wyckoff. Could I have an appointment as soon as possible. I just need some professional advice. 4:30? Yes, that will be fine. Thank you. Put your hands up here. Does it hurt? No. In here? No. Alright. I believe we were classmates together. I remember you were a fine basketball player. Oh, yes I was quite an athlete back then. Actually I probably lost a great deal playing that game. I might have been a surgeon at the Mayo clinic by now if I hadn't played so much basketball. Have you ever been in love, Miss Wyckoff? Now, please, don't think I am one of those doctors who tells their patients as a way to solve their problems is to a have romance, but nature wanted us to use our bodies. If we don't... they dry out. And function poorly. Must be very difficult being an unmarried teacher in Freedom. You have so little privacy. You think an affair would help me? That's what you're trying to tell me, isn't it, doctor? I can't believe that these terrible depressions I've been feeling can be cured by romance. I'd like you to see a psychiatrist in Wichita. A Dr. Steiner. He's a good man, take my word for it. Came out from the East a few years ago. He's Jewish. You don't have any antagonism toward Jews, I hope. I have no racial prejudice at all. I fought at the school for total integration. Here is his name and address. I'll advice him that you'll give him a call. Is it terribly expensive? I am sure he'll work something out to in your budget. I hope so. Here is a prescription for assecitol. To let you get some sleep. Also I am going to give you one for hormone pills. Why are you giving me hormone pills? What's wrong with me? I believe you may be going through a premature menopause. Now, I could be wrong. We'll get the laboratory results back in a few days and confirm one way or the other. Meanwhile I want to take you these hormone pills just to bring you around again. But, Dr. Neal... I am only 35. That's why I said premature. I hope it can be averted. What can be averted it's up to you. And Dr. Steiner can help. Thank you, doctor. Has anyone ever told you that you are a very attractive young woman? [singing] [laughing] That was great. This is really good spaghetti. Isn't it good, Evelyn? It's not bad at all. (Marie) I just love your silver. We lost our silver. During the war. The World War ll? No, the Civil War, darling. When the Yankees came down on our plantations, just destroyed everything. (Mary) You must have been a very young girl. And my grandfather, he told me they tended to kill every single little chicken with his sword. (Beth) Terrible. You know Louise Dorismeyer? Mm-hmm. She can't even eat chicken. They have a lovely home. Everything antiques. Just gorgeous. A little plain, maybe. Back home there was a hardware store run by old man Blunker. When he died they opened his safe and counted $200,000 in cash. [indistinct chattering] I'll drink 1:0 that. [singing] [glass shattering] Evie, why did you do that? Look at you! When I was 30 I found out that when I read I don't have to worry about translating. You have a gift for languages, Lester. And I am going to give you some extra reading assignments. Okay, Ms. Wyckoff, I see you tomorrow. See you, tomorrow, Les. Bye-bye. Evelyn. 20 minutes to get on that bus. Don't be late. Come on. Here. You can put it on in the car, come on. I will. Oh, Rafe, don't wash that part of the board. Watch your step. Here you go. On board. Thank you. Hello. Watch your step. Watch your step. So long, Red. Miss Wyckoff. You seem to be hurting an awful lot. Yes. It happens all the time. I thought it would pass, but it hasn't. I can't function anymore. What did you do to your hands? I was at a party and everybody was having a great time and there was this mirror... I was drawn towards it and... What did you see in the mirror? Myself. Did you look like... you? Yes. Yes and no. I don't know. You didn't like what you saw. No. I wanted to smash it. I wanted to smash everything. Maybe you've disliked yourself a very long time. Is that possible? Yes. And it's gone worse. It's not only myself. It's my work. It's everything. Everything seems pointless. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to get up in the morning. And when I do, even the sunshine looks idiotic. I understand you've missed a couple of periods. It's that so? Yes. Do you think you're pregnant? No. No, I couldn't possibly be. I am not married. How about your boyfriend? Couldn't he be responsible? I don't have a boyfriend. Do you ever have sex? You seem to find it difficult to respond to that one. Has it been a very long time since you were with a man... sexually? Have you ever been with a man? [music playing on radio] [chattering] Well, I think he is... Yes, maybe. Nobody did. I know John Kingston. He bragged that he passed his modern European history course by sitting in the front row with his legs spread... wide apart. You know. In case. Chester Rawlings wanted to make you suffer. Boys do that all the time, they don't mean anything by that. Besides, my kid brother did that. Your kid brother was not assigned homework with kind of reading of communist literature, was he? Of course not. What's that got to do with anything? Chester Rawlings is teaching commy propaganda to the students in this school and I think it's unamerican. Commy propaganda?!? Yes. Marx, Karl Marx, the communist. I don't see how you could teach a course in modern history without reading Karl Marx. Oh, really? His philosophy completely changed the destiny of Russia and China. More than half of the world. I don't see how you can ignore Karl Marx. You don't have to assign reading matter that he wrote. It's communistic. It did cause revolution. If we're all going to understand Russia and China. Right or wrong, the least we could do is to read the sources of their political beliefs. Suppose we forbade our students to read Thomas Jefferson. Beth, what's the matter with her? Nothing, she just thinks she's right. I do, too. I heard she was going to Wichita to a psychiatrist. I heard she was doing it because of... the change. What's wrong with going to a psychiatrist? A lot of famous people go to psychiatrist. Well, I hope he does her some good. I didn't have a moments problem with the change. Poor Evie. I'm just afraid she's going to get in trouble talking about things like that. About communism? Yes. Senator McCarthy has revealed a lot about fellow travelers in the University. But they can be in High School, too, you know. Isn't it, Red? I began to think you got yourself a boyfriend over here in Wichita. You got to tell him that all the money he's spending on the bus tickets, you could buy yourself a wedding ring. Let us know when the kids are, Red. To tell you the truth, I don't think I could make this trip without you. Do you miss your mother and father? I miss my father. He's a warm, generous man. But my parents didn't get along too well together. In fact they always started fighting. It was always the same, sooner or later they'd start to fight and I was always frightened. Of...? The fighting. When they yelled at each other, did they get physical? I used to hide in the closet, so I couldn't see what was going on. But I could hear it. I thought they would kill each other. Did you think someone might kill you? Yes, I stood up for my father once. I thought my mother would want to kill me. Do you think she wanted to kill your father? Well, there was this time when... he had a cut on his head and he was bleeding. And I went to help him to wipe his head and... he was just standing there with no clothes on and my mother was screaming at him. Then she pointed at him and said: "All I ever wanted to do is to do it." And she-. She grabbed me and threw me out of the room and she said I grew up to be the same. The same as her, or the same as your father? I don't know, but just the same. How old were you then? Eight. How old were you when you had your first period? Eleven. What was your reaction when you first started to menstruate? I was very pleased. But I didn't tell my mother. Was that pleasing? Yes. What else pleased you? Going to movies. I used to go a lot. I used to fall in love with the movie stars. I used to go alone. I like being alone. And I love my work. After all it's been my whole life. It's better not to need anybody. It's better to be self sufficient. And to be... to be free of all that. But that's not good enough anymore. "Mm? You haven't got a husband, a lover, children. I've thought of children. If this menopause is true, then... it's all over. Maybe it isn't all over. Your life is more important than shadows on a screen. I think this is a good place for us to end this session. How long is your Christmas vacation? 12 days. We've got into some pretty serious things right now. I think we should continue to go into them deeply. We are to see each other as often as possible during your vacation. Then we can decide what's going to happen next. Yes, mother, I know. I wrote you the letter so that you wouldn't be upset. Hiding what, mother? No, I don't have a sweetheart. I am sorry mother. I'd love to come home if I could. But I have this work to do. Yes, mother, I'll call you Christmas morning. (Beth) Evelyn. Now, if you get lonesome, you'll come, you promised. Don't worry about me, Beth, I'll be fine. Mr. Hemmings. Merry Christmas, Beth. Merry Christmas. Have a good time. Oh, thank you. Merry Christmas. Now, you promised. (Evelyn) Merry Christmas, Beth. Merry Christmas, honey. Evie, come in here with us. Thanks, Mrs. Hemmings. But I really have to work. I have a lot of "Thank you!" notes to write. [Christmas carol playing] Watch your step. Watch your step. M, daddy! Sonny. My boy! HI: (Kid) Where have you been this time? Oh, you'll be surprised. Because I got something good for you. Hey, Red, listen. I just had a great thought. Why don't you and me have a couple of coffee together? I am sorry, I can't. I have an appointment. Oh, come on, Red, whoever he is, he's going to wait for a few minutes for you, wouldn't he? Sure he would. What do you say? Well, l.. Come on. Really. Just one. Alright. You see how easy that was? [music playing on radio] [indistinct chattering] A couple of cups of coffee. What's your first name, Red? Evelyn. Evelyn Wyckoff. You don't mind that I call you Red, do you? No, I rather like it. No one else ever has. You mean to tell me that nobody ever teased you about that red hair when you were a kid? Yes, but that was a long time ago. You're a nice girl, Red. I am really no girl. Well, you are to me. Thanks, Ed. You're welcome, Red. Red and Ed sounds like a comedy team, doesn't it? Yes. Here you go. Thank you. Thank you. I am sorry about the wife, Red. Oh, please, don't be. It's perfectly natural you should have a wife. I wasn't surprised. You mustn't apologize. I apologize because I like you. Because I like you, I think you got the right to know. Just how it is. I understand how it is. How about you? You got a husband? No, I am not married. Your mind is peacefully alone without a husband. Some guys don't know what they are missing. There's something else, too, Red. Some of those guys got married when they were young to some hot looking broad, just because she was sexy. And as the time goes by they find out that... Well, there's a lot of other things that a woman could be besides as being sexy. And that's a lot more important over the long haul. What other things might a woman be, Ed? You just take a look in the mirror someday. Take a good look at you. You'll see what I mean. That's one of the most beautiful things anyone ever said to me. Listen, Red, I am going to have a little word with you. I am not the most faithful to the wife. I could show you a real good time. I never had a first class woman like you. How about it? I just couldn't, Ed. You are married. I wouldn't feel right. Oh, you take your fun when you can find it, that's my model. I just couldn't. Well... when you change your mind you just give me a little wink and I am here, okay? And I'll show you a real good time. I guarantee it. [cashier bell rings] Why didn't I take him up on it? Because he's only a bus driver? Because he is married? Or because I am afraid? Now, you're going to put your head to one side and look at me and say: "Why are you afraid, Miss Wyckoff? Maybe we should change places. Dr. Steiner... I am afraid I wouldn't be what he expects in bed. A woman at my age, with no experience. Maybe he'd be disillusioned. I think you're expecting me to give you the permission to have an affair with the bus driver. Of course not. But I suspect you might be pleased if I did. You want someone to tell you to go ahead and do these things you are so frightened of. Why? First, you'd be relieved of guilt. And if it should turn out to be an unhappy romance you'd have someone to blame, someone else besides yourself. Being alive is learning how to make decisions. Your own decisions. Without persecuting yourself by worrying about what other people will think about you. People would do anything to avoid humiliation and shame. It's very frightening when new and powerful emotions are being born. And you are experiencing a rebirth. Sometimes it takes a long time, doesn't it? Some people never make it. Four, three, two, one... Happy New Year! [music playing on radio] It certainly can't be any worse than the last year. Mildred, don't be a pessimist. It's going to be a wonderful new year. Sure. I'll drink to that. (Marie) Oh, me too. Oh, Evie. It's such a pleasure to see you like this. Like what, Marie? Like yourself. God, Evie. You know the last time when you were here, when you smashed your hands into the mirror. I was very scared. Oh, I was just going through a bad time. Things are different now. It's a new year. New resolutions. [music playing] (Man on PA system) All aboard. Bus to Wichita boarding at front door. Wichita? Is Ed on the other route today? No, he quit. Left town. Left his pretty little wife, too. [bus engine starting] He was gone. Left town. I decided to take him up on his offer and I was going to spend the night with him. I seem to see you smile. You are pleased with yourself. Well, I'm not exactly happy- But it was the first time I'd ever... I liked him. And I know he liked me. And I think you're liking yourself a little bit more then when you first came to see me. Well, I can't understand why arn I not crying now that he's gone. I even bought some new clothes. What sort of clothes? Pretty lingerie. That's not just clothes. I really splurged. That was so luxurious. I couldn't afford them. You couldn't afford not to afford them. (Mr. Havermeier) They are demanding that I fire Chester Rawlings. They saying he is soft on communism. Calling him a Red. Really, it's an awful mess. Here, look! Even The Standard has come up with an editorial criticizing the school's educational policy, hinting at un-Americanism in the Freedom high school faculty. I am forced to fire him. I think that's a mistake. In fact I know it is. What if I've done the same thing? There's plenty of Latin that's uttering too, Mr. Havermeyer. Mrs. Wyckoff you've been here for ten years. You are a respected teacher. Your reputation is impeccable. Chester, on the other hand... Well, I don't spend a lot of time listening to idle gossip, but there are certain rumors, I mean public opinion is against him. His personal life is not the issue. How can we teach about freedom, if we... It'll get very unfortunate, but I am only a public servant. What can I do? Maybe we could arrange a meeting with the PTA and explain to them why we can't do it. And who's going to do the explaining? We of the Midwest with all our faults, all our isolationism are in difference to political and social conflict. We are America. The back bone of America. To forbid the studying of a political philosophy like that of Karl Marx, which differs from ours is to imitate the communists and countries where education is a farce. As another philosopher, Edmund Burke said: "The only thing necessary for triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." And good people of Freedom, if we permit people like Joe McCarthy to bully us into firing Mr. Rawlins for assigning the reading of Karl Marx, we are unamerican. Imitating communists, fascists and totalitarians. For only we are the guardians of the precious freedom we have in America. [applauding] Oh, Evie. I loved the speech. Evelyn, I think you turned the whole thing around. Well, thank you, Mr. Havermeier. And don't forget, 8:30 in the Chinese restaurant. I'll see you. Okay, congratulations! Thanks. You were very convincing. Thanks a lot. [indistinct chattering] Beth! Beth! Beth! [car engine starting] Chester! I didn't see you tonight. Where were you? Were you there? Yes. But I hid. I hid. I was so terrified. I thought they were going to tar and feather me and run me out of town on a rail. Oh, come on, Chester. Don't think it can't happen here, it wouldn't be the first time. Of course, I want to thank you. But Evelyn, you can't imagine what it feels like. That hatred. I've never felt so alone before. I didn't know that it could happen to me. Don't. Chester, please don't. You're a fine teacher. You've done nothing wrong. Yes, but what's going to become of me? Do you think they'll throw me out? They're saying so many terrible things about me. Chester, don't. Don't. [sobbing] Please, Chester. You know, if we keep this up they'll be saying something else terrible about you and me. [breathing heavily] Come on! Walk me as far as my house. Alright? (Mrs. Hemmings) One of my old girls. Gilbert! (Mr. Hemmings) Hmm? What if we were harboring a communist right here in this house? I wouldn't want that. Even if it was Evie. (Mr. Hemmings) Evie, a communist? Lola, what have you been drinking? Just the same. I think we ought to watch her. (Beth) What do you expect to see? That's silly, Mrs. Hemmings. [clears throat] [chuckles] Evie, come on in. Mrs. Hemmings here thinks you're a "pinko". Show us your card, kid! [chuckles] Well, I might as well tell you the truth. I've fallen in love with Chester. But he won't have me. Huh, Chester! [street noise] [whistling] (humming! I beg your pardon, Miss Wyckoff, didn't mean to disturb you with my vocalize. No, you are not disturbing me, you have a good voice. Haven't seen you around in quite a while, Miss Wyckoff? Been busy? Very busy. You mind? No, go right ahead. Must be kind of lonesome for you, school teachers, huh? What do you mean, Rafe? Well, I don't know... Seems to me, none of you gets much fun in life. Oh, I guess we manage, alright. Folks told me you've done a lot of good for the negro students here. You got them the right to eat equal in the cafeteria. Yes, that's right, I did. I wonder how many of you, white people really mean it when you pretend that you really care about us, negroes. Rafe! You'd better leave here at once. I'll have to speak to Mr. Havermeier. What's the matter, Miss Wyckoff? Did I say something wrong? No, you didn't say anything wrong. I know you're in scholarship at the Junior College. You'd better be careful. [footsteps departing] Oh, hello. Problems? No, I just wanted to talk to you. I was... Well, it's nothing, really. I was just worried about old man, Bose. He used to clean the classroom. He was the janitor. I wonder why he isn't here anymore. Is he sick or something? Gall bladder. Don't worry, he'll be back. He's alright, Probably sometime before the scholarship athletes will have to start training for track, anyway. When will that be? Oh, I don't know. Evelyn, you don't look well. Are you taking care of yourself? I wouldn't want you to have a relapse. Oh, I am just fine, Mr. Havermeier. Just fine. [door closing] [school bell ringing] Now, remember, this is just a practice test. And it would just show us if you need any extra help. And if you do, sign up for tutoring and I'll help you prepare for the final. Thank you. Bye-bye. Oh, Rafe! When are you gonna go out for track this year? I ain't. Why not? Ligament. Oh, you tore a ligament. That's what the doctor says. I'm sorry. I ain't. Don't really like football. Oh! It's swollen. Want to feel? Feel that swelling there? Yes. You can feel it better here. Let me show you. That's beginning to swell, too. Leave down my hand, Rafe! Let go of my hand! [flies] [flies] I am warning you! Not one sound! [locking the door] [flies] [gasps] No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No, please, no! No one is going to hear you. Relax, Miss Wyckoff! I'm going to get inside that tight place. I know you're going to like it. [Crying] "o, M, no! Oh, no! You're going to like it in. You're going to want this thing of mine every time... No, no! Yes, you will, baby, yes you will. No! You just relax, is going to be nice and easy. Now relax, damn it! [crying] [moaning] Stop. Please, stop. I think I'm bleeding. Stop! When I'm ready. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Please stop! Stop! [moaning] [raining] [footsteps] [Dicks up phone] [dialing] Dr. Steiner, please. Oh, where is he? Why didn't he tell me? What emergency? Are you sure you can't get him? How long will he be gone? No, no! I don't want to talk to another doctor. (Mrs. Hemmings) Evelyn? You're very late whatever kept you. [indistinct chattering] Oh, this, Kathy. Very good. [school bell ringing] [street noise] Good morning, Alan. Good morning, Theresa. Now, today... we're going to start a new unit on Cicero. As you know, Cicero changed the course of the Roman empire. Tracy, I can see you did your homework. [school bell ringing] Tomorrow we'll work on past pluperfect subjunctive. [zipping sound] Where was you yesterday? I went shopping with some friends. After this you be here! Understand? That sounded like an order. What's the matter, Miss Wyckoff? Didn't I, uh.. Have enough to give you? What happened last Friday will never happen again. Where you think you're going? I'm going home, Rafe. What's the matter, Miss Wyckoff? I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't. You must let me leave, Rafe! You must let me go! Just relax, Miss Wyckoff. I'm not going to hurt you again. Rafe! I just want to hold you. Don't you realize how dangerous this is? Just want to hold you. Rafe, just please let me go, Rafe. Rate, stop this. Stop it'.! Stop it! Stop it, Rafe. Stop it! Stop it! [music playing] [birds chirping] Hello, Beth. Oh, Evie I've been looking all over for you. We're all going to have Chinese food and then to the 7:15 show. Do you want to come along? Not tonight, thank you, Beth. Okay. [car engine starting] Oh, has Ms. Hughes gone already? Yes, ma'am. She borrowed a book of mine. You haven't seen one with my name on it, have you? No, ma'am. Oh, I'll just take a look. Do you mind having to work while being on scholarship? It is hard to do your studying and train for football and cleaning up the rooms and... You, boys, don't like the one they call Rafe, do you? The boy who cleans my classroom. He's no boy, he's a man. What do you mean? Coach Simmons found him in a Pool Hall in Oklahoma City. Hustling for a living. I bet he's about 24 years old. Thinks he is God's gift to the football team... Royal Lord of the Jungle or something. Does he sleep in the dormitory? They threw him out, because he wouldn't bunk with no one. Anyone. Wouldn't bunk with anyone. Yes, well. He's a powerful back. Makes a lot of touchdowns. But that don't matter to me, 'cause I don't tolerate nothing from nobody. If he doesn't live in the dorm, where does he live? Probably sleeps in a boarding house. I heard he spent some time in a home for juvenile delinquents. Well, he doesn't seem to be here. [laughing] [street noise] [door opens] Hello, Rafe. You liked what I gave you yesterday? You liked it, didn't you? You want it again? Well, now. Come on over and get it. Come on, Miss Wyckoff. Don't let nothing like this go to waste. You better come and get it while you can. Let's see you beg a little, Miss Wyckoff. What do you mean, Rafe? I'd like to see you crawl over here on your hands and knees. And beg. I could never do such a degrading thing. Yes, you could. Come on, now, let's see you. Down on your knees. BBQ- Junior here wants to lower the tension. If you ain't nice to Junior, his daddy is right to get mad. Move! You mean this? Now! Come to me. Move! [sighs] Well, that's fine. That's fine. You was doing just fine. [chattering] HI: Hello, Beth. You sure have been quite lately. It's all your fault that we have them here. But you don't look to happy about it. How can you say that, Beth? Do you see that one over there washing the dishes? He is the kind that makes everybody hate niggers. Beth! That's what he is. An apalling nigger. Where I come from, we tell the truth. And truth be told, I don't like that arrogant, kid. You can't pretend you like him, either. He sweeps the floor in my classroom and he looks at me like I am the dirt. And believe me, I return the favor. Racial prejudice is one of man's most difficult problem to solve during his time here on Earth. Perhaps God intended to be that way. And if we don't solve it, Beth, we're all going to be destroyed. You sure do get fired up, don't you. What do you want to do for dinner tonight? I'm so sick of Chinese food I could puke. [laughing] [phone ringing] Calling so early?! Is Saturday. Beth. Hello. Oh, yes, just a moment. It's for you, Evie. [Evie whispering] I told you never to call me here. But I can't meet you. Alright. [footsteps] Do you have any idea who that man might be? He keeps calling. Does she have a gentleman friend, Beth? No, Mrs. Hemmings. I hate to say this but that man's voice sounds like a negro. Really? I told myself at first that it was just one of her Negro students calling about school work. Well... I suppose there is some logical explanation. What if I told to some of the guys on the team what a good piece of ass you are, Miss Wyckoff? School board wouldn't waste no time getting rid of you if they would find about us, would they? Why do you want to harm me? I don't know. Rafe, promise me... Promise me you'll never tell anybody what has happened here between us. Sure. I promise. You don't care what happens really, do you. Listen, if nothing else, at least we could have respect for each other. You don't respect anybody, do you? Yes. Me. [door opens and closes] [door Squeaking] (Mrs. Hemmings) Evie, I almost forgot. A Dr. Steiner called. From Wichita. He wanted you to call him. Thank you, Mrs. Hemmings. Evie. [laughing] [indistinct speaking] I told them what a good piece of ass you are, Miss Wyckoff. They say they won't tell, if you give them some too. I was just teasing you a little, Miss. Wyckoff. I wouldn't tell those dummies nothing about you, baby. You are all mine and I'm keeping it that way. They would be jealous if they knew what a good lady you can be. Besides a good-looking nigger like me ain't got to track with those fools. No, baby- I'm ready to take care of you. What if Miss Wyckoff is putting out for that chicken bone. Of course she is. What else would they be doing in that room all hours. Shit. I can't believe it. I had her for four years on Latin. You didn't have her the way he is having her. A nigger. Jesus. I never heard of any white woman doing it with a nigger before. I heard she's going to some psychiatrist. I guess she must be crazy or something. He is not that bad looking for a nigger. Just the same. I have my private opinion of any white woman doing a thing like that. We don't know for sure that's what's going on. You can't condemn a person without a trial. As far as I'm concerned just being in the same room with that chicken bones guilty I would stay out if I was you. (Miss Wyckoff) Rafe! No! [crying] [yelling] [crying] You rotten bastard. [moaning] [groans] [slamming door] [indistinct whispering] Oh, God. Excuse me. I am Mrs. Brewster. Mr. Havermeier called me this morning. And said you will be unable to handle your class today. He would like to see you in his office as soon as possible. Yes, I see. Here is the rule book. The first assignment for today was to read and translate pages five through eight of the first Catilinian Orations. I'll leave you my terrarium Mrs. Brewster. I promise to take good care of it. Thank you. [music playing] Please sit down. You know, in all my years of experience. I don't think I've ever been in the position that I've hated as much as I hate this one. Nor have I ever been more at a loss to understand if the reports that I've heard are true. They are true, Mr. Havermeier. Well, I think I've had enough psychology to understand that there must be some reasonable explanation, either emotional or psychological for what you've done. If you want to tell me about it. Mr. Havermeier, I think the reasons are unimportant. I mean, I have always felt that... teachers need more emotional outlets. Goodness knows that... some of the normal past times and recreations that others enjoy so freely are denied thus. I enjoyed a drink now and then. I would never allow myself to be caught with a glass in my hand. Obviously measures would be taken against this negro, Rafe. I wouldn't want to see him lose his opportunity for an education. It is in the Juniors College Board's hands now. Certainly the football fans would be upset if they kicked him out. But they musn't. Between you and me I think that the next time before he scores a touchdown whatever he's done, will be forgotten. The resentment against you is much stronger. I've already received some very threatening phone calls about you. It's ironic, isn't it? A man never suffers the same social ostracism that a woman does in situations like this. That's true. You must realize that the pressure is on me to... You are probably the finest teacher that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. But I have to ask you to resign. As of now. I understand. I mean that I think you should plan on leaving now. I know. Is there anything I can do for you? Well, it would help if you could possibly give me a recommendation. I realize what I am asking. But maybe in some place, far away... I feel certain I could leave up to any recommendation you can give me. It's alright. There was a young man that I went to school with when I was getting my Masters Degree. He's a very bright fellow. He's now superintendent of schools some place in New Jersey. He's... He's a good fellow and he's broad-minded. I would have to tell him that I asked you to resign. And give him some truthful explanations. But at the same time I could still give him a very... very good recommendation for you as a teacher. You know, I for one believe this... behavior, pattern... the lapse in it is over, that it won't recur. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I guess this is good-bye. Yes. Yes. Good-bye. Evelyn. Why? Why on Earth did you do that? Mr. Havermeier, you've been very kind. Good Luck, Miss Wyckoff. Dr. Neil. What can I do for you, Miss Wyckoff? I am leaving today for a long trip and I don't sleep well on trains. Last year, when I went to Italy I didn't sleep at all. Could you... I need something to help me sleep. So, you're asking me for sleeping pills. Yes, that's it. I need something strong to help me treat this. Of course I'll give you a prescription. Naturally I heard what happened. I wasn't suggesting any such thing, you know. I was encouraging you to find a gentleman friend. I never had the slightest intention that you... Well, I hope you don't think that I was suggesting anything quite like that. Dr. Neal, will you give me a prescription for sleeping pills? Of course I will. I am very sorry about what happened. Must be very... Please. I'll call the pharmacy. I hope you have a pleasant trip. Thank you. [dialing] Would you, please, send a cab to 1230 Meadows Lane? Right away. Thank you. [footsteps] Evie. Hello, Beth. Are you leaving already? The sooner, the better I should think, wouldn't you? Well, I didn't... Yes, I guess you're right. Is Mrs. Hemmings at home? I think she's in her room. She didn't come down when I came in. Where you're going go? I don't know. Why in the Heaven's name did you do it? I feel like... You were my best friend. And now I feel like I hardly knew you at all. Why didn't you talk to me? Maybe I could have helped you. Beth. Please. What happened to me was inevitable. I wouldn't change it. And I feel no shame for what I did. Good luck, Evelyn. [car horn] [car engine running] I'll take these. My things are upstairs. Evie. Good-bye. Good luck. Good luck. [music playing]
