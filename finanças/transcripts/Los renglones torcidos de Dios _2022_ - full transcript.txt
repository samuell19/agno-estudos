NETFLIX PRESENTS OUR LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN HOSPITAL 5 KM Are you sure you're all right without me? Yes. Someone might recognize you. Everything will be fine. Thank you for your courage. The one we've been expecting. The new one has arrived. Everything is in order. The city council delegate signature, the medical report... All forms have been signed by her husband as well. Very good. And this too. TO SAMUEL ALVAR I don't think Samuel will mind. It's from the doctor who advises her hospitalization. "An apparent characteristic of this sick woman is having answers for everything, even if it means telling lies, for which she has a rare ability." "Even though her lies often contradict her previous statements..." ...in case she is caught in a flagrant contradiction, it does not take long for her to find an explanation as to why she was forced to lie before, but now she's telling the truth. Do not underestimate her. The intelligence of this woman is such that she easily fools those who are less apt or doctors lacking experience. "...lacking experience." Lucky for you, you're neither of those, sir. What is your name? Alice Gould. - I see that's your maiden name. - That's the name I prefer. You were born in? In Plymouth. My father was English, though my nationality is Spanish. - Tell me about him. - My father? Mm-hmm. We loved and appreciated each other. And is there a difference between those two? Yes. The first indicates my love. And the second, our reciprocal admiration. - Talk about your mother. - No. My mother died when I was little. My father was the only family I had until I met my husband. You have a happy marriage? Heliodoro and I have always been very close. For 16 long years, we've suffered the boredom we share without complaint. What line of work is your husband in? Losing my money at poker. And playing polo. - Not educated? - No. He says he studied law a few years, but I don't believe him. He's profoundly ignorant, poor man. - And you? - I am not. Sorry. - I received a degree in chemistry. - You work or do research? I'm a private investigator. ARROGANT, HATES HUSBAND A different line of research. - You know where you are? - I'm in a nuthouse. We actually prefer "asylum" or "psychiatric hospital." But are you at all aware of exactly the reason you're here? Yes, doctor. I was legally kidnapped. By whom? My husband did it. According to your file, you've attempted to murder him on three occasions. Poisoning him using a... a substance impossible to detect in urinalysis. Your husband noticed and reported it, and Dr. Donadío decided to send you here immediately. That is all false. Tell me one thing. You prepare the poison yourself? - I wouldn't even know how. - How strange. Considering you have a degree in chemistry. Tell me something, doctor. If during my stay here, I have to receive some ovarian surgery, for example, would you be the one operating? No, I would not. - Strange, considering your medical degree. - Not my main area of study. And my area isn't poison. - Don't believe a word you read there. - Should I believe you, then? I was not placed here by a court because I was not accused of any crime. I didn't make an admission of guilt to Dr. Donadío or anyone else. I won't be forced to make a single admission other than I'm being held against my will. All this is a trap. - But whose? - Heliodoro's. I have no reason to poison my husband at all. Although I can't speak for his motives. Are you insinuating that... your husband has tried to poison you? - Is that it? - Yes, I am. And why would he ever want to do something like that to you? To become the sole administrator of my large fortune, obviously. - Sure. - Listen. If I tried to poison my husband, why wouldn't he call the police, then? To save you the embarrassment? And to try to get you help. Reporting me would've meant I'd be assigned a guardian, thus preventing him from handling my assets. Think about it. It doesn't make any sense that I would ever try to kill my husband. You've confessed that you feel... animosity towards him. Heliodoro's a fool. He is. But I would say his beauty's inversely proportional to his intelligence. And I very much value beauty, doctor. I assure you that I have no reason to destroy such a splendid ornamental object as my husband is. PURE PARANOIA - Oh, sorry. - No, Montse. Come in. Uh, Montserrat Castell, deputy director of the facility. She will guide you through your first steps. - Anything else you'd like to add? - Yes. I need to know when Director Alvar will return. In two or three weeks, I would estimate. Don't worry. Trust me. You're in the best of hands. The facilities are very large. We have several common areas that all the patients here can access during the day, including a forest of several acres out back. Despite being hospitalized, you will have a reasonable sense of freedom. The director has introduced manufacturing workshops. Toys. He believes that making the patients feel useful helps in their recovery. Modern psychiatry. At ten, every cell door closes until the next morning. Ours is a world that is governed by many rules. Different from what you're accustomed to. I will do my very best to adapt, Montse. I hope so because now you'll have to follow the two most difficult ones. The wedding ring too? You can't have any personal belongings in the cell. Sure. What about cigarettes? Can I light one more with my lighter? Hmm? - Last one? - Mm-hmm. THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS Also my books? - But what harm can books do? - You can't have any personal items. Please. Just one? - All right, just one. - This one. SYNDROMES AND TYPES OF PARANOIA Next rule isn't quite so difficult, I hope. Open. Your underpants. - Excuse me? - Underpants. Crouch down. Imagine taking a crap. Now, crouch down. Hurry up. Here, put this on. Yes? Yes, she's inside. She's changing. Of course, she has to have dinner. Yeah, okay. They're ready for us. We can have dinner, and then I'll take you into your cell. No. I'm not hungry. You ready, then? Open the door? One last piece of advice. Once you walk through this door, forget who you are out there. Starting with your name. What's wrong with my name? Alice Gould. Pretty but different. Too different. In here, all patients are equal. In the morning, they'll bring everything you need to freshen up. I'll let you rest. If you need anything, you let me know. Lights out. WHO SENT IT? MURDERER: YOU KILLED HIM, NOT ME. Something must have happened in there, but the police won't listen to me. Help me, Alice. Please. I'll find out what happened to your son. TRAGEDY IN THE DEL OLMO FAMILY Get back inside! Whoo! Back inside, I said! Come with me! You! Everyone! - Everyone, back inside. - What the fuck is going on here? It was started by someone. When I arrived, all the cells were open. They went through security and reached the main entrance. I want that front gate shut immediately. Go do it right now and control the perimeter. Samuel! Got another problem inside. Hey! Get out of the way! - Move! C'mon. Let the director through! - That's enough. What are you doing here? Didn't I... You're going to need all the help you can get with what's happening, Samuel. Get everyone into their cells. Go. Now! Let's go, everybody. Back to your cells. Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Come on. It's shower time. Come on! Come on, ladies! Come on! Let's go! Empty the potties, okay? Come on in! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Come on. Those of you in the showers, hurry up! Come on! Come on, ladies. Hurry up a little bit. What's the matter? Have we overslept today, or what? Huh? Empty it. Come on! Then you have the third shower free. After that, go brush your teeth. Come on, ladies! We don't have all day! Very good. Good. C'mon, ladies. Stay in line. Stay in line. Come on! Why'd you come here? Where have you been? You know that... I am not dead. Excuse me. You're sitting in my seat, you know. I didn't know there were assigned seats. - Sorry. - They always make an exception for me. Don't get up. Don't get up. There's room here for both of us. And from the look on your face, I think the last thing you need is to be alone. - They let you have wine? - Yes. What you have before you is a real rarity here. You're looking at the only one who admits that he's crazy. You're not mentally ill, I'm assuming? - No. - Good for you, my dear. You see, I am still the exception. Ignacio Urquieta. Alice... Alicia. Pleasure. And tell me, Alice, what is it that brought you to Wonderland? You're not wearing a bra. Unbelievable! You filthy rat! Even if this elephant protects you, you're still a fucking little shit who doesn't know how to distinguish a lady from a whore like your mother! It's nothing. Don't worry. If it's any consolation, he does that to everyone. - If he were a threat, he'd be in the cage. - What? What cage? You don't want to end up there. Believe me. Hey. What is it? Cigarette? First the wine, and now the lighter. You're privileged here. You've already been looted? They even took my underwear. You're lucky you weren't here years ago. Samuel Alvar, the new director, changed everything. He removed the bars from the windows, opened the doors, allowed us freedom to move. Yeah, that's what they say. Everyone says that he's great. - You met him? - Uh-uh. But looking forward to it. Beautiful things can be born in the most hideous places. How did they end up here? The twins were born in the asylum. Their parents were oligophrenic. We've always called them Romulus and Remus. Romulus and Remus. Which is which? Romulus is the mimic. He spends his days imitating everyone. And Remus is incapable of speaking. What about her? Romulus says she is his little sister. When he gets tired of goofing around, he sits next to her. He protects her. - And is she really his sister? - No. But he thinks she is. And he'd kill anyone who said otherwise. He'd really kill? Are you exaggerating? Absolutely not. No! I wanna drive! I wanna... Let me drive! Oh my God. What a mess. We have a young male. The victim of, uh... multiple wounds. They appear to be stab wounds. Would you like us to move the body somewhere quieter for your examination? No, that's up to the coroner. - Have they located Lucía yet? - She's on her way. - Who might have had access to the cell? - Only the patients on this ward. All men, I presume? Yes. The women are in the ward on the other side. They only mix in the common areas. - Nobody has touched anything here, right? - No. I'd say we have ourselves the murder weapon. WHO SENT IT? NOV. 24, 1978 YOU KILLED HIM, NOT ME. Do you mind if I sit? Excuse me. I'm Alicia. I'm new here. Did you know a young man named Damián García del Olmo? Don't waste your time, young girl. Your friend is a mutist. He's a mutist? He can't speak? I CAN SPEAK, BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT! If you are intrigued by a mystery or need to gain some knowledge, come sit by my side. I am the author of the theory of the nine universes. I can give you answers to all the questions you have. I'm not looking for anything. Thanks. We're all looking for something. Insanity is just the fastest way to find it. Hey! Hey, you! Leave her alone! Romulus! Take it easy. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down! Relax. - Okay. Calm down. - Leave her! Easy. Easy! Relax! Leave him alone! Alone! Stop! Get away from him! - Calm down. - Easy, Romulus! Stop! Stop it! Calm down! You calm down! Alicia, your consultation. That's enough, now! Easy! Easy! It's all right! It's all right, okay? That's enough! That's enough! RESTRICTED ACCESS ARCHIVE Come in. - César. - Hello. I'll leave her here. Alicia, welcome. - Thanks. - Come in. Please have a seat. I'm César Arellano. The head of clinical services. - Nice to meet you. - Yes, you too. I'll be in charge of your tests. - What tests? - Trials. Most of them will consist of having a nice chat. Well, that will surely be a welcome change. I only ask you to be honest with me. Try to be transparent. I will do my best. There's one part I would appreciate reserving for Dr. Alvar. All right. If we get to a part reserved for the director, just say, "I'll reserve that," and we'll get to something else. Hmm? - No medication? - No. I'll wait for the director to prescribe any medication. - Shall we start? - Sure. Twenty-first of March 1979. First session with Alicia Gould. Repeat after me. Eight and three. Eight and three. What do you see... in these drawings? Three birds flying. A cow in a meadow. - A horse and a gentleman and a forest. - Good. And now point to your nose. Then point to your knee. Fabulous. We've made a great discovery. You're mentally past three years old. You wouldn't mind if I smoke, then, right? Go ahead. Thanks. Well, let's take it up a notch. - Let's see what happens. - All right, then. Name three philosophers. - Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato. - Not Greeks. Descartes, Kant, and Schopenhauer. Though I shouldn't have named him. Why not? Because he was a jerk who disrespected women and thought that we were animals. Hmm. If you happened to find a sealed envelope on the street, what would you do? Well, I would open it, of course. Even if it's not yours? You didn't say it wasn't addressed to me. Now let's do a simple exercise. I'll tell you a word, and you tell me the first thing that comes to mind. Mm-hmm. - Sun. - Life. - Silence. - Does not exist. - Love. - Salvation. - Sex. - Pleasure. Forgive my bluntness. I assume you're not frigid. No, doctor. Some women are. Or they have clumsy husbands. Or very selfish. Which one is yours? I'll reserve that. Does it have anything to do with you trying to poison him? I'll also reserve that. And forgive my bluntness, but why is any of this relevant? 'Cause our sexual health can also show us how mentally healthy we are. Is that the idiotic Freud? - He wasn't exactly an idiot. - Well... To think that anyone who dreams of a cathedral spire is expressing longings related to the virile organ is perverted, doctor. I would agree with that. But he was also a wise man who discovered how to access the subconscious. Freud was a pervert. And I avoid perverted people. They simplify things as complex as someone's spirit. But forgive me. Now I'm getting into your field, and we were playing with words. Sorry. Family. Joyfulness. - Children. - Frustration. Please elaborate. Heliodoro didn't feel it was for him. Has your husband always been faithful to you? I don't know. How would I know? Snooping around would have meant distrust from me. And you? Have you been faithful? I have been. Has anyone ever attempted? Yes, doctor. Many times. Have you been attracted to these suitors? Yes. - And yet? - Never. Tell me, Alicia, do you despise anything about yourself? Seeing myself like this. Your favorite thing? My desire to be better. My need to always accomplish anything I want. Please, proceed this way. Someone broke in here, but we have no idea who it was. The victim's cell is in the male ward, number three. Hmm. To get there from the laundry, he had to pass through the other units, opening all the doors as he went. Could it be that the killer set up all this chaos to cover his tracks? If so, this would make our investigation a little easier. Evidently, it seems. Such an elaborate strategy, huh? Narrows down the suspects, don't you think? - And what's your opinion about all this? - Inspector. I don't think now's the best time to be walking around the place, you know? What if you take the body tonight? And tomorrow when everybody's calmed down, you come back and start your investigation? That will have to be decided by the clerk acting on the judge's order. So while we wait, I'd like you to please cooperate. Of course. We can make you a list of the most able-bodied if you like. I'd like to question them as soon as possible. - Hello, Alicia. Good morning. - Good morning. How are you? - Fine. You? - Fine. Did you sleep well? Well, I felt a little anxious. Not knowing what you'd ask me today. Actually, I wasn't planning to ask you anything. Oh really? - Have you grown tired of me? - No, on the contrary. You'll choose the topic that we talk about today. What if I'm too indiscreet? That'd be fine. Thank you. Well, I'd like to talk about your glasses. They're so ugly. You should definitely get some bigger ones. Tortoiseshell. You'd look much better. - Oh! - Sorry. I'm very clumsy. I'm very sorry. - No, no. Leave it. You're making it worse. - I'm so sorry. - Can I use the bathroom? - It's for staff. - But do you have a key? - Yes. - Please. I'll just be a minute. - Okay. - Here. - Thank you. Be right back. Yeah. Excuse me. There must be a leak in the bathroom. The hallway is flooding with water. Thank you. What the fuck? Someone, bring me a mop! PERMITS JANUARY 1978, APRIL 1978, MAY 1978 OCTOBER 1978, NOVEMBER 1978 REGISTER - PERMISSION TO LEAVE NOVEMBER 24, 1978 EVACUATION PLAN Quiet! You will be escorted to your cells. And you will remain there until further notice. Except for those of you who are on this list. I'll call out the names. Don't mess around, or you'll be put in the cage. David Cobas. David Cobas! At your service. Joaquín Palacio. Fuck! Fucking God! I've had enough of you psycho fuckin' murderers! - David Cobas! - I've had enough! Álvaro Sanjuán. Murderers! I'm so sick of murderers! Ignacio Urquieta! Urquieta. Ignacio Urquieta. Urquieta! Urquieta! Urquieta! Urquieta! Ooh! Urquieta! Urquieta! Urquieta! Let go of me! Let go! Let go of me! Stand back, everybody! Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Calm down, now. Calm down. Please, Ignacio. Look at me. Good. That's it. That's good. Calm down, now. Good man. I'm the coroner. The inspector and the court clerk are waiting for me to proceed with the removal of the body. - Didn't they tell you I was coming? - Yes. Yes, I'm sorry. You're one of the patients allowed to carry a lighter, right? So what? So that's the lighter you used to start the fire in the workshop? You knew everyone would try to put it out. You are completely wrong, inspector. You had blood all over your hands. Please explain that. When I saw what happened to the boy, the first thing I did was try to help. But it was too late. I did not kill that boy. I swear. Inspector, the court clerk and the coroner have just arrived. - And that's why you're interrupting me? - It's not Lucía. Someone else is here. I don't give a damn who it is as long as she does her job. And quickly. The inspector says they can proceed to examine the body. Perfect. Well then, tell them we're starting. I will, sir. Thank you. Although many of you are like little trees, only able to vegetate, you should know that God also has a place for you in the kingdom of heaven. He loves your defects. And your suffering makes you even more worthy of his mercy. Brethren, you may go in peace. Amen. Hello? I know who you are. Hey! Take it easy, Romulus. Calm down. It's nothing. Long time no see. Arellano has kept me busy taking a lot of tests. I'm sorry. Jeez. Arellano? He's boredom in human form. You want one? I understand that a few months ago, you were given permission to leave. November 24th. You remember? Um, yeah, I have permission to walk around town when my sister visits. How do you know? MURDERER: YOU KILLED HIM, NOT ME. Did you send this letter? What is that? Did you know Damián García del Olmo? He was placed in ward three. - Ignacio, tell me. - I have to go. I'm talking to you. November 24th, someone sent it to his father. And the handwriting indicates a person with schizophrenia. Why are you here? I'm talking to you! This handwriting indicates schizophrenia. Why are you here? You don't understand. I have to go. No, no, no, no, no! You're not leaving! Ignacio! Come here. Ignacio! Come here! Stop! What's wrong with you? Ignacio, get up! What's wrong with you? Ignacio! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! What is it? Please help! What's wrong with him? Help! Come here! Ignacio, what's wrong? Look at me! Look at me! Hey! Please help! Ignacio, what's wrong? Ignacio! What's wrong with him? What's wrong? Please help! Didn't you know? Water is bad for him. Just like parsley is bad for parrots. You'll be okay. Ignacio! Ignacio! Ignacio! - Help! - Where are you going? - Help! - You're gonna leave him here? Inspector, the coroner has requested an emergency autopsy. An autopsy? What's wrong with her? This case is almost closed. We just need our friend here to confess, and we can go home. He's innocent. He couldn't get near the murder weapon. - And why is that? - It's in his medical report. The coroner requested it upon arrival. The suspect suffers from an irrational fear of water. - Is this true? - I'm afraid so. Doctor? The court clerk would like to have a word. This is so gruesome. And what the fuck is she looking for? It doesn't take an Einstein to figure out how the kid died. She says he has several broken bones. Maybe it's important. Damn novices, Soto. They always think they know everything. But they just get in the way. Mm-hmm. She's the last one. There's no one left in the back garden either. They're all inside. Now, come in. Get a head count. RESTRICTED AREA You finish the head count? Oh shit. - Come on. - Please. Let's go ahead and get all the questioning done now. We've narrowed the list of suspects to 15. Very well. Send them to me for questioning. - What's going on? - Samuel. We have one patient missing. A hundred and thirty-eight empty cells, but 137 patients. Who's missing? It is a priority to isolate patients in their cells. Now the priority is nobody escaping from here. This is your fault, so fix it. Get out. Well, you know who it is. I have hydrophobia. That's my disease. I've always had it. No one knows why. I'm not even able to look at water. Let alone touch it. Well, now you know my secret. - Yes. - Will you tell me yours? I'm not crazy. - Wow. I thought that you trusted me. - I pretended to be paranoid. I've entered the hospital to investigate a crime. I'm a detective. My, oh my. Now, that's a new one. I'm telling you the truth. You're worse off than I am. I'm investigating the death of Damián García del Olmo. He was hospitalized here over a year ago. They said it was suicide, but... it just doesn't add up. You suspect he was killed? My hypothesis is that it was one of his father's former patients. They wanted revenge in the worst possible way. Well, then that rules me out. I don't know the guy. And plus, whoever killed him was schizophrenic, so that's not you. But it must've been someone very intelligent. That would definitely rule me out, actually. He was very careful. And he set it all up so it appeared like suicide. - He even fooled the doctors. - Well, that's what Dr. Alvar thinks. He's the only one who knows what I'm doing here. And he's given you permission to sniff around the sewers of his temple? Well, you see now, the boy's father's a friend of his. Tell me about Damián. He suffered from schizophrenia. Hallucinations. He heard voices. And stuff like that. Subjected to electroshocks. Insulin treatment. They say it works with the most violent patients. And Damián was? He was violent, yes. Very. Especially with Luis Ojeda. Who's Luis Ojeda? Your buddy from earlier. The little one. Tell me. Well, that night that they found Damián, Luis was missing. He was missing? How could that be? Since the director granted freedom of movement to the patients, some of them hide in the woods for a while until they get caught. I seem to remember Ojeda doing it that day. Are you sure about that? Absolutely. Hey. Are you okay? Did he hurt you? Where's the dwarf? Where is he? Tell me where he is. C'mon. Just... It's... Calm down. Just take it ea... - Where did he go? Where? - No! Did we have any luck? No. Their stories checked out. Or they are incapable of a crime this elaborate. Hmm. You still haven't found the patient who escaped? No. Inspector, you mind if we have a quick word alone? In my office. I'm sorry you got dragged into something that we could've taken care of ourselves. But you know. The new protocols. Too many changes in this country lately. Thank you. Well, we can still avoid unnecessary hassle. Cheers. I don't even want to imagine what may come next. Interrogations, paperwork, lawyers. And calls from reporters. I'd rather be kicked in the balls, I assure you. Well, that makes two of us. Proposing something, doctor? Sometimes I dream about the asylum. The other day, I was looking at the photographs of my patients, and I couldn't help thinking... Are you religious, inspector? Yes, I am. I was thinking, if God created us in his image and likeness, like a sculpture with no imperfections, the patients who end up here would be like God's crooked lines when he was learning how to write. What kind of God allows so much imperfection? I am convinced that he has a plan for them as well. I think that plan's been reserved for me, inspector. What are you telling me? Whoever has committed this crime is one of those crooked lines. What is the point of starting all this long and painful process if the culprit eventually winds up locked back up in here? Perhaps this missing patient could mean trouble for you? Yes. And maybe for you as well. The clerk has already initiated proceedings. Well, surely you have some authority here. What would you get out of it? I've introduced certain reforms that have recently been put into doubt. It would not look good to have an incident like this on my record. Reforms? You're one of those who likes to initiate change. The things that are important, however, should never have to change, inspector. Mind if I get that? Yes? Okay. They found her. Have you seen the dwarf? I'm sorry. It's okay. Easy. Easy. Have you seen the dwarf? Is he around? Have you seen him? I know who you are. Huh? I know who you are. What do you mean? Come with me. - Come. - Where? Home. Come on. You're taking me home? Yes, come on. No, Romulus. Come. This is beautiful. Is this yours? I built it for her and my brother. And for you. - For me? - Yes. But why for me? Because I know you're our mother. Romulus. But how do you know I'm your mother? Because you are a very special woman. You're not sick like everyone else. And you are going to stay forever. - Right? - Mm-hmm. You won't abandon us? No. I will not abandon you. Did you hear that? Mom is staying. - Is there anyone else with you? - No. - Your brother? - No. No? You stay right here. Don't move. Alicia. Alicia! It's César. It's César. What happened? - Relax. Alicia. - What is this? - Easy. - César. Calm down, please. It's better if you relax. Don't hurt yourself. - Please listen to me. Please. - I'm tied up. Listen to me. You killed someone. What? Who? Luis Ojeda's dead, and you were found next to him. - Luis Ojeda? - Yes. Wait. What happened? You don't remember doing it? Doing what? No. No, I... He jumped up on... onto me. He jumped from behind. I'm trying... to remember. He was trying to... He was trying to, but... He tried to rape me. Get this off! Please calm down. - Untie me. - I can't. I'm trying to remember. Maybe there was someone else there. It was an accident. I'm telling you. - César, just please let me get up. - I believe you, but I can't untie you. Whatever it is you're saving for Dr. Alvar must be very important. No. Stop. Alicia, I have to call the police. No one here's gonna call anyone before I talk to the patient, Arellano. I... I didn't know you were back. Yes, well, I decided to end my vacation early. To talk to you, alone for a little while. - If you don't mind. - Sure. I'm Samuel Alvar, the director of this institution. How are you, Alicia? How are you feeling? Disoriented. It's good to... good to finally meet you. I didn't know how much longer I could last here. You've gotten me into trouble here, Alicia. I'm sorry. - That dwarf jumped on me, and... - So I've been told. Yes. However, now I have to deal with one of my patients being dead. So the question is, what are we gonna do now, Alicia? First, I'd like to bring you up to date here. - And we can proceed from there. - Hmm. All right. So, let's hear it. Is there any other patient information that's not in the archive? - Because I'll need to get it from you. - You want files? - Yes. - Hmm. I got the files for Damián and the charts of patients' departures, but I still don't... I don't see anything clear yet, and the truth is, I doubt very much that Luis Ojeda had the capacity or the help to make a murder appear to be a suicide. I just... I'm far from knowing who did it, doctor. Mm-hmm. You want one? No, no, no. I'm still dizzy. Suicide? Well, you know the theory that my client and I are working with. Your client... was? Um, what? You already know my client. I do work with the minds of my patients, but so far, I've not yet developed the capacity to read them. I'm Alice Gould. Alice Gould de Almenara, doctor. I'm very aware of what your name is. We've been exchanging letters following Dr. Del Olmo's instructions. Information that you sent of what I would need to get into the facility and pretend to be sick. - Explain these instructions. - No. I won't explain any more until you, sir, can explain to me why you keep asking me what you already know. What are you doing? What are we doing? Making fun of me? I have never made fun of any of my patients. What do you mean, "patient," exactly? Is this a game to you? A game? No, I take this very seriously. Listen, Mrs. De Almenara. I do not know how you've come to these interesting conclusions, but I can assure you that you and I have not had any type of written correspondence. And furthermore, I've never corresponded with Dr. García del Olmo about you. That's just a lie! You're lying right now, and you know it! - My patients don't speak to me that way. - I am not your patient. I am here as part of my investigation. - Do you understand? - I'm afraid not. Well, I'm leaving, and I'll ask my client for an explanation. - Come back here. Alicia! - I'll ask del Olmo for an explanation! I'm leaving now! - What are you doing? - The phone. Heliodoro? Heliodoro, is that you? You're talking to the operator. You don't have access to outside. I wanna talk to my husband. - Samuel Alvar. Please send two orderlies. - Why are you doing this? You are very sick and will be here with us for a very long time, Alicia. You motherfucker! Hey! Get her! Open the door! Open the door, please! I'm Alice Gould de Almenara! Please, I'm being held here against my will! Open it right now! - Let go! Let go! - No! Stop it! Let go of me! Hold her arm. Ah! No! No! You son of a bitch! What is this? Uh, where am I? In isolation. How long have I been here? Three days. They gave you sedatives, and you've been asleep ever since. - I gotta get out of here. - I'm sorry, but you can't. After your psychotic outbreak, Alvar considers you a danger to others. No, I didn't have any outbreak. No. You attacked him and tried to run away. Why did you do it? I found this in your cell. You hid these in your book, didn't you? I'm not crazy. Please get me out of here. That can only be decided by the board of physicians. And believe me, right now, there is no reason the board would convene. Unless you give me one. You can trust me. I have reason to believe what happened to Damián García del Olmo was not suicide. - No. That's impossible. - Montse. Listen. You are asking me for a good reason to convene a board meeting. That's what I gave you. Take me to them, please. I swear. I promise I'll prove I'm telling the truth. Well, first of all, I wanted to apologize. I assure you that I am not a violent person, but I've gotten myself into a labyrinth, and I can't escape without your help. And what labyrinth is that? The reason that led me to come to this asylum. That reason is that Dr. Donadío sent her here following his own diagnosis after receiving her husband's request. No. He did not. We have a document signed by him attesting to this. - He didn't know what he was signing. - He doesn't know you're here? No. When I arrived, I thought I'd only be here for a few days, so I told him I was going to Buenos Aires to investigate a fraudulent will. That's not what you told us initially. You told me your husband had tried to poison you. - I lied to you. - Mm. Almost all of my first statement to Dr. Ruipérez is false. Could you specify how much? I described a personality of my husband that wasn't true. And I feigned a disdain that both of us are far from feeling. Heliodoro and I love and respect each other. Do you admit that you deliberately misled Dr. Ruipérez? Consciously? Precisely. For what purpose? Faking a mental problem to get me into this facility. This is unbelievable. If I may say so, what is unbelievable is how easy it was to mislead someone with your responsibility. I wonder how many poor fools are locked up because of your incompetence. - You better watch yourself. - Doctor. Please, sir. I had to investigate, and the best way to do that was from inside. But why? Wouldn't it have been easier to lie about that too? Well, I thought they wouldn't believe it. And that they would attribute it to another element of my fantasy. Well, it's clear that I wasn't mistaken. In other words, sometimes you lie, sometimes you don't. I have never lied to you, doctor. Okay. So why lie to Dr. Ruipérez, then? I lied to Dr. Ruipérez because I needed admission into this asylum. I was truthful with you because I was already inside. Tell us about this private investigation, if you will. - Dr. Alvar knows the details. - Dr. Alvar knows nothing. That is not true, doctor. You know as well as I do that Dr. Del Olmo hired me to investigate his son's death. He himself brought me here on the day of my admission. Young Damián passed away, but there was nothing mysterious about his death. He took his own life. Well, that's the official version, yes. But his father never believed it. That's what he told me the night we met. ♪ You won't admit you love me ♪ ♪ And so, how am I ever... ♪ It was at the New Year's Eve gala held at the Ritz. ♪ You always tell me... ♪ Heliodoro and I attend every year. ♪ Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps ♪ I recognized him immediately. ♪ I've asked you... ♪ A few weeks earlier, I had been working on a case that kept me awake at night. That evening, while thinking about how to approach it, the story hit the press. The investigation into his death is following its course... The image of the boy struck me. What could have led a young, educated boy from a good family to end up like that? - Madam. - Thank you, María. I didn't know it back then, but it was a sign of things to come. TRAGEDY IN THE DEL OLMO FAMILY One detail changed everything. My husband knew Dr. Del Olmo. Del Olmo! I'll be right back. ♪ If you can't make your mind up... ♪ - Have you been hiding from me? Kidding. - No. How are you? I'm glad to see you. Now, I want to talk to you about something. Alice. ♪ Being parted... ♪ I don't think you know each other. Dr. García del Olmo. My wife, Alice Gould. Heliodoro had told him about me. He needed something, so the next day, he summoned me to his office. My Damián suffered a lot, but he would never have killed himself. I told him when I got back from my conference in Mexico, I would get him out of there for good. A few days later, I received this. MURDERER: YOU KILLED HIM, NOT ME. Someone wanted to hurt me by taking away what I loved the most. I'm convinced something happened in that place. But the police won't listen to me. Help me. Please. The handwriting confirmed that the letter had been written by someone suffering from hebephrenic schizophrenia. And sent from Robregordo two days after Damián died. GRAPHIC ATLAS OF SPAIN That's less than ten minutes from here. I studied the case thoroughly. I considered the idea that some former patient of García del Olmo wanted to take revenge for something. On the bus, please. Thank you. Okay ma'am. There we go. Come on. The patient who sent in that anonymous letter had authorization to leave. To access the records, I needed to work from the inside. INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES? Only the director could help me. Samuel Alvar is a friend of mine. I recommended him to the minister of health for the position. He's willing to collaborate. You will be able to work from the inside. But no one can know about this. - He's so pretty. - Oh yeah. He's beautiful. - He really is. - Thank you. - That's a great horse. - So great. In the letter, the director gave me detailed instructions on how to infiltrate the asylum. He recommended the best mental illness to achieve this. SYNDROMES AND TYPES OF PARANOIA Paranoia. "No, no, no, no. I'm not here because of any sentence." "I was not accused." "I'm not here because of a sentence. I was never accused." "I was not..." "Excuse me?" "No, I've been kidnapped legally. Yes, sir, I have been kidnapped legally." The next step was to convince Dr. Donadío, our doctor, to sign a report attesting to my condition. Yes, that's correct. Over the next few weeks, more letters came in from Dr. Alvar that helped give credibility to my performance. But I wanted to add a personal touch. "A characteristic of this woman is to have an answer for everything, even if it means telling lies, for which she has a rare ability." "The intelligence of this woman is such that she easily fools those who are less apt, or doctors lacking experience." "Do not underestimate her." I myself wrote the letter signed by Dr. Donadío. The envelope was sealed, so you have proof that I'm not lying. The doctors lacking experience? That was not you, Dr. Alvar. I didn't know you yet. REQUEST FOR VOLUNTARY ADMISSION The hardest part was left. Heliodoro had to sign the application for voluntary admission that authorized him by law to lock me up. ♪ Beautiful sun ♪ ♪ Shine on a little while ♪ ♪ Fill up my soul... ♪ I mixed it in with papers from the bank that he had to sign. - How are you? - Fine, and you? What are you doing? Well, having a look at your magazine. Oh, my magazine? What for? I don't know. Ah, by the way, I have some things we have to sign. Okay. I couldn't tell him the truth so as not to jeopardize the investigation. DETAILS OF CONTACT PERSON OR REPRESENTATIVE ♪ Or drifting with the tide... ♪ Thanks. Two days after that, I told him that I had to go to Buenos Aires for work. And that's how I ended up here. Are you ready? I'll find out what happened to your son. May I smoke? Yes, of course. But you'll have to tell us if you've found out anything we should know. At the moment, nothing conclusive. Perhaps it's because there's nothin' to conclude. Have you considered that? The letters I exchanged with Dr. Alvar are in my office. You can have access to them if you want. My keys are in admission. I shouldn't need to tell you that such letters don't exist. I understand your concern. I really do. And I would be sorry if this little recklessness led to your... release. - Or got you struck from your profession. - I know what you're doing. You're trying to divide us, but make no mistake. I am not your enemy. He collaborated in the forgery of official documents of the city council in order to help me get admitted. And I suspect that's why he pretends not to know what I'm talking about. But don't worry. I'll make sure the police are informed about your role. Wanna involve the police, huh? Fine. Call them. Please. And remember to inform them too about you killing one of the patients. I am the victim of a sexual predator who was able to attack me because the rules governing this facility, your rules, allowed it. That's why you won't call the police. Because patients are murdered here because of your incompetence. - Enough. - A death's the last that you need. A death that must not have been the only one. Am I wrong? On many occasions, you must have been responsible for the death of patients. I've had enough! That's enough! Look, Alicia, I'm addressing you knowing you're a sick individual and a patient. I'm considering your very vulnerable state. But I'm also speaking to you knowing that you're a very intelligent person. And I want you to know that even though you are sick, you are responsible for your lies. For your tricks. For your conscious manipulation. And I must warn you, if you do not change your attitude and stop manipulating my doctors, or if you continue to investigate the other patients in pursuit of a crime that never existed, I most surely will have to consider every word you tell me as part of your paranoia and take more drastic actions. Your conduct constitutes grave and immediate danger to other patients and yourself. I will not allow any more deaths. Why are you lying? Why are you doing this, doctor? Do you know what? Sooner or later, my husband is going to find out I'm here, and he's going to come looking for me. And Dr. Donadío and del Olmo are going to back up my version. You're trying to cover up the death of an innocent man, and I am going to find out why. This man died at the hands of a deeply disturbed woman. This fact, added to the delusions we've just witnessed, show that Alicia de Almenara constitutes a serious threat to herself and to the rest of our residents here. And she must be treated as such. We have yet to receive a single complaint about her. Because she lived happily in her fantasy, but as I confronted her, she attacked me. However, she successfully passed every test she was given with scientific rigor. Yeah, the rigor in your pants. That is not at all my case, and I also doubt she is a threat. We know about Luis Ojeda's behavior. I think Alicia acted in self-defense, and it would be a mistake to diagnose her on that basis. Perhaps adding Ojeda's death into this discussion is only confusing us. Question is, do we accept this accusation of attempted murder made by her husband or believe that she made it up in order to investigate? Neither of these versions have been confirmed by the husband, Dr. Donadío, or García del Olmo. We have to contact them. We're five psychiatric doctors, and we're unable to agree on a diagnosis of a patient without submitting to her narcissistic demands? What are we doing here? What's happened to my distinguished staff today? What's wrong with cross-checking information? And what's wrong with you giving me more credibility than the patient? Nothing, but we don't know your opinion. In my opinion, the arguments Alicia de Almenara presents are cold and astute. Qualities that someone capable of poisoning possesses. Also my books? But what harm can books do? - You can't have any personal items. - Please. Just one? The patient suffers from a pathological arrogance in accordance with her intelligence. She thinks she's more cultured, sensitive, spiritual, distinguished, elegant, delicate than everyone else. And as soon as something threatens her delusion, she turns violent. Freud was a pervert. And I avoid perverted people. They simplify things as complex as someone's spirit. In my opinion, the patient made very clear, in her grandiose manner, and with her elaborate thinking, what's the reason that made her try to poison her own husband. What? She couldn't bear the humiliation of realizing that the man she had chosen, among all those other wonderful suitors, that fantastic ornamental object, didn't really want her. He wanted her money. I described a personality that wasn't true. And I feigned a disdain that both of us are far from feeling. Heliodoro and I love and respect each other. Let us analyze what we know up to this point, taking as truth the report from Dr. Donadío, the doctor who signed her admission, and we will get to know who really is Alicia de Almenara. It all started on October 17th. Wow! That day, the patient showed up by surprise at her husband's polo club. - To have lunch with him after a game. - Congratulations. Hello, my love. How are you? When he arrived at the table, she had already set everything up. - Here's your favorite. - Oh, thank you. - Bloody Mary. - Mm. Love it. Mm. Hours later, while playing one of his usual poker games, he began to feel unwell. Excuse me. On November 20th, one month later, and without the doctors having been able to explain the cause of his mysterious illness, Mr. De Almenara felt the same symptoms again after dinner. You're not hungry, sweetie? Ah, no. No, not really. And she was swept away by her delusion. A delusion that was joyful but painful. ♪ Strawberries, cherries And an angel's kiss in spring ♪ ♪ My summer wine Is really made from all these things ♪ ♪ I walked in town on silver spurs... ♪ ♪ A song that I had only sang... ♪ Alice! - ♪ She saw my silver spurs ♪ - Alice! ♪ And said, "Let's pass some time" ♪ ♪ And I will give to you summer wine ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Summer wine... ♪ ♪ Cherries and an angel's kiss in spring ♪ ♪ My summer wine Is really made from all these things ♪ ♪ Take off your silver spurs ♪ ♪ And help me pass the time ♪ ♪ And I will give to you ♪ ♪ Summer wine ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Summer wine ♪ ♪ My eyes grew heavy And my lips, they could not speak... ♪ ♪ I tried to get up But I couldn't find my feet ♪ ♪ She reassured me With an unfamiliar line... ♪ ♪ And then she gave to me ♪ ♪ More summer wine ♪ ♪ Ooh, summer wine ♪ When Dr. Donadío showed up, alarmed by the call, he noticed severe symptoms of poisoning. He didn't say anything then, but a terrible suspicion began to grow inside him. He remembered that the day before, his wife had gotten rid of the maid a few hours before dinner. At the time, he thought nothing of it. When he felt better, he decided to find out what was really going on. Honey. You okay? Yeah. That night Mr. Almenara confirmed the worst of his fears. He didn't want to involve the police, so he called Dr. Donadío back, who saved her life by pumping her stomach. Thank you for coming right away. I appreciate it. This is it, Enrique. I found it in the kitchen. You can analyze it. I haven't told the police anything yet. My theory is that the patient knew she had been discovered and that she was probably going to be institutionalized. And her mind snapped. Her subconscious knew what she had done, and she deserved punishment. But her conscious mind couldn't accept it and blocked it out. She began to distort her reality. So she created a story to get admitted here, not as a mental patient but as a private investigator with a most admirable assignment. Solving a crime. That is her real delusion. The character she's created for herself. Because do you know what the mental affliction was that she chose to feign? The one she has. A combined case of paranoia... and simulation. The patient will continue with the antipsychotic medication I prescribed. Thank you. However, I insist we need more evidence at this time. We could very well be holding a healthy person against her will. If she's telling the truth, that report is useless. So I also think that it's a good idea to contact Mr. Almenara and Doctors Donadío and Del Olmo. It's either that or the police. You decide which. Excuse me. A patient would like to talk to you. He says he witnessed Luis Ojeda's death. As I told you in private a couple days ago, the day it all happened, I was in the recovery room. I'd suffered a seizure. Hmm. When I left, I went to look for Alicia at the workshop. Why? I was worried about her health. I remember she told me some wild story about an investigation. Ignacio... Please, Alicia. Let him continue. I was told that she had gone into the forest to talk to Ojeda. I went to look for her. I had inadvertently sent her in his direction when I told her that he and Damián had fought sometimes. When I found her, Ojeda was trying to rape her. I wanted to intervene. But when he saw me, he jumped up and ran away. But unfortunately, he tripped and cracked his head open. I went down to get help. Someone must have found the body sooner and came to the wrong conclusion. Is this all true? Yes. As far as I can remember, it is. Well, that settles it. We will include this statement in the report. And no additional police intervention will be necessary. Thank you very much, Ignacio. Thank you. And now, if you will allow us, we have a private matter to discuss with Alicia. Good afternoon. I'm Alicia Gould. I understand you're aware of my situation? You've spoken with Heliodoro? We called your home, but we could not reach your husband. I shouldn't have told him I was going to Buenos Aires. He's probably there looking for me. If so, then it's surprising that he's not contacted the embassy or the police. What are you implying? That it's strange. Unless she was able to achieve her goal before coming here and her husband is actually already dead. You're not going to find anyone dead in my house, okay? Why don't you go check? I'm serious. Or better yet, call up Dr. Donadío. Have him do it. Clear up this whole misunderstanding. - Dr. Donadío is in Zurich. - In Zurich? We have notified him by telegram, but there's been no response. The only person who can prove or disprove your version is Dr. García del Olmo. What are you waiting for? Have him come in! Let Raimundo García del Olmo come, please. Alicia, when you saw this gentleman who was carefully listening to the statement of Ignacio Urquieta, you assumed he was with the police. It couldn't be further from the truth. You recognize him? No. I don't know who this is. Why would I recognize him? Because I am Raimundo García del Olmo. And you claim that you are here acting on my behalf. You've nothing to say? No. I can't. I can't. Why not? Why can't you, Alicia? Why not? Why can't you say anything, Alicia? Because this is not Raimundo García del Olmo. - It is him, Alicia. It is. - No. - Yes. Yes. - No. No. This man is not Raimundo García del Olmo. No, no, no, no, no. This man is not the one who hired me. It's not him. He's not the man who brought me here. Alicia. There's no doubt that he is who he says he is. Tell us who brought you here. I'm telling you, Montse. Raimundo García del Olmo. He didn't bring me. It's not the man who brought me! This man didn't bring me here! Raimundo García del Olmo. I'm telling you! No. You're not listening! Raimundo García del Olmo! Montse, please believe me. It's a trap. No, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute. Just a minute, please. Please. Don't touch me! Let me go! - Come with me. - Please! Montse! Montse, it's a mistake. - Let go! Why are you doing this? - Stop struggling. You son of a bitch! - Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! - Just follow us. Stop. Quiet down. Settle down. - Son of a bitch! Let go of me! - Come on. - Don't! No! - Listen to me. Let's go. Out this way. Come on. Here we go. Stop struggling. - Montse! - Listen. Come with us. Stop. Shh. Quiet down. - No! - Quiet down. Yes. Stop it. No. No. Alicia. Look at me, Alicia. You don't have to talk. If you know who I am, blink once. Where are you? Alicia? Do you know who you are, Alicia? Everything will be fine. Thanks for your courage. Who are you? Dr. García del Olmo. No. Tell me the truth. Who are you?

All right. Thank you. - Need anything? - No. You sure? Dr. García del Olmo. Thanks for your courage. Who are you? The truth is whatever you want it to be. Dr. García del Olmo. Everything will be fine. Thanks for your courage. Tell me the truth. Who are you? The truth is whatever you want it to be. Thanks for your courage. Sweetheart? Are you all right? She's opened her eyes. Alicia. Can you hear me? Alicia, listen to me. You have to resist, okay? - I swear I'm going to get you out of here. - Okay, you got to visit her. We have to go before someone sees you. No. Don't worry. They'll watch over her. Come on, let's go. You have to be with your little sister. You can't leave her alone. Come on. Heliodoro. Go on. - Your husband isn't here. - It was him. It was him. It was... It was him. Did you visit her again? Yes. - How is she? - We have to get her out of the cage. I cannot disobey the director. - The treatment is excessive. - I know that. But you saw what happened with García del Olmo. Clearly, we were wrong. What if I had an explanation? What I told Ruipérez turned out to be true. What? Heliodoro planned everything to steal my money. He's the only one who could manipulate the newspaper to make me believe that Del Olmo was a different person. When he signed my admittance forms, he knew what he was signing. Then he hired someone to impersonate Del Olmo, Montse. - That's too much. - No, you were right. No one actually killed Damián. Your admission was checked and approved by the city council. Legally speaking, it's all in order. Yes, yes, yes. Because they had to rely on Donadío's help. And I'm sure he promised him money. My money. What a bastard. It's true that Donadío must have received our telegram in Zurich. And yet, he's not contacted us. His plan was perfect. He knew they'd keep me here. And the more I insisted I was investigating a case that never happened, the crazier I would look in everyone's eyes. Starting with the director himself. Oh my God. We have to warn Alvar. He's been deceived just like you. Unless he was also involved in some way. That is going way too far. Is it? That would explain his obsession with altering Alicia's faculties. Applying such aggressive treatment to her. These are very serious allegations. You have any way of proving them? My bank accounts. If the money's not there, that would explain Heliodoro's sudden disappearance. - Let's call the bank. - No, it wouldn't work. I would have to go in person. No. I was able to get you out of the cage, but only the medical board can discharge you. It's the only way, Montse. It really is. If we follow the money trail, we will reach Donadío, Heliodoro, and I'm afraid Alvar as well. And if this theory doesn't work out, what happens then? Then you must please forgive me because that means I must be crazy. You stay here. Don't do anything till I get back here with you. Come with me. Let's see. Hmm. Okay. As soon as he wakes up, have him moved to his usual cell. Yes. And call the family. Alicia de Almenara? Is she in the medical room? Dr. Castell told us to stop the treatment this morning. NATIONAL POLICE Good afternoon. I'm here to file a report. I work in a psychiatric hospital. We have reason to believe one patient has been kidnapped legally. What do you mean? FROM MR. HELIODORO DE ALMENARA THE AMOUNT OF TWO MILLION PESETAS What the hell are you doing here? What does this mean? Alicia's husband paid almost 20 times more than usual for her private admission. Those funds were intended as a donation for the asylum. Why's it in your name then? Just calm down. I put it in the hospital's account. You'll find it all in the books. Everything. Every penny is there. No one donates that much just for nothing. - What did you promise him, Samuel? - Nothing. I've never spoken to Mr. Almenara. And if I ever do, I would assure him that everything I've done is to help his sick wife. Her admission was made in accordance with the law and under the direction of Dr. Donadío, and we're not even considering her version. She's been admitted, and it's our responsibility to heal her. That's our mission. And there is no place here for anyone who's forgotten that. You understand me? Where is she now? She's back in her cell. Very well. Go pack up all your things. You are fired. Go find her now. Samuel Alvar. Alicia de Almenara is not in her room. No. She may be trying to escape. Have you seen Alicia de Almenara? Has anyone seen Alicia Almenara? Have you seen Alicia? Alicia Almenara? - Alice Gould? That's her name? - Yes. As I told you, I'm a doctor. I work in a psychiatric hospital. And we have reason to believe that she has been kidnapped legally. She needs to know the balance of her bank account to confirm her suspicions. That's an unfounded suspicion since all the documentation is in order. No. No, no. It's not in order. Her husband has been missing for weeks. But no one's reported it. Not his family. Not his friends. I'm doing it on her behalf. You may call her if you wanna check what I'm telling you. Has anyone seen Alicia Almenara? Have you seen Alicia Almenara? I said have you seen Alicia Almenara? Have you seen Alicia Almenara? I've seen her. - I've seen her. I've seen her. - Where did you see her? - Where? - In the toy workshop. Since your patient is legally incapacitated, such a complaint must be made officially. You mean you need authorization from Samuel Alvar? Inspector. The results of the autopsy. Yeah, thanks, Lucía. We're finished. Uh, but excuse me, inspector. I told you that this case... The coroner and I now need to investigate some actual crimes, so if you don't mind, we're done here. Hmm? Have a nice day. Strange, isn't it? A physician coming here to report a problem in his asylum? Have Soto call the Central Bank. Has anyone seen Alicia de Almenara? Urquieta? Last time I heard, she was in the cage. She was last seen running towards the workshop. Don't always trust what people say. There are some crazy folks around here. I warn you, if anyone tries to help her, they will receive the same punishment as her. No one is helping anyone. Thank you. Thank you so much, Ignacio. You are welcome. What's going on, Alicia? I need to get out of here. I need to get out, or else they're going to destroy me. Please! Listen to me. I need to get out of here. But I need your help. We would gladly help you, but it's impossible to escape. No, no. I have a plan. I have a plan. But I need your help. Yeah? Can I count on you? Can I? Ignacio, I'm gonna need your lighter. PAINT THINNER Hello? Montse. It's me. I'm at her house. Who let you in? I took the keys from the storeroom. It's clear that the husband's left. This house has been empty for a long time. Alicia's right. She was tricked into the hospital. Come back right now. There's a lot going on here. PRIVATE DETECTIVE Oh, yeah. Come on, Ignacio. Calm down. I'm gonna call a doctor. Fire! Let's go. Get out! Fire! Fire! Get out! Fire! - Fire! - Where? Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Come on. Let's go! Fire! There's fire! Fire! Let's go! Fire! It's okay. Remus. Remus, calm down. Easy. Come on. Let's go. Let's go! Come on! Fire. Come on and get out! Now! Get out! Fire! Hurry up! Come on! Fire! Everyone out! Fire! Come on! Move! Fire! Fire! Fire! Go out! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Come on, let's get out of here! - Fire! - You're gonna get burned! I need help! Come on! Let's go! Get out! Let's go! I won the lot... Over here! Hey! RESTRICTED AREA - No, no, no. - Ah! Help me. Easy. Easy. It's okay. All right? You're gonna be just fine. Come on. Let's go. Keep walking. Come on. Keep going. You're doing fine. No. No. Romulus. God! Romulus. No. Damn! Back to your cells! Hold them! - Hey! Get out of the way! - Move. That's enough. What are you doing here? Didn't I... You're going to need help with what's happening, Samuel. Agent Soto. Inspector Ruiz de Pablos. We got a call a moment ago about a dead boy. I can take you right now to his cell. Excuse me. Can you open the gate? What? I'm the coroner. The inspector and court clerk are waiting for me to proceed with the removal of the body. Didn't they tell you I was coming? Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. Excuse me! I've been told it's in the male ward. In cell 317. The deceased is a patient called Romulus, isn't it? Could you show me where the cell is? Can you hear me? Coming! Thank you. Whoever has committed this crime is one of those crooked lines. What is the point of starting all this long and painful process if the culprit eventually winds up locked back up in here? Perhaps this missing patient could mean trouble for you. Yes. And maybe for you as well. Mind if I get that? Yes? Okay. They found her. This woman is not a patient of ours. - But she's wearing our uniform. - Who the hell is she? Her name is Lucía. And she's our coroner. She's the coroner? Oh God. Arrest that woman immediately. Inspector, I'm sorry to have impersonated your coroner, but I really had no choice. Who the hell are you? She's one of our most dangerous patients. You can arrest me. I won't put up any resistance. But there's something you should know. Don't believe anything she says. She's clever and will try to deceive you. No, that would be your specialty. I just want to tell the truth, which will explain my strange behavior tonight but also who committed this crime. So you know who murdered this boy? Yes. As well as who is responsible for it. Me. - Yes? - I'm the coroner. Where the hell is Lucía? She had an emergency and sent me on her behalf. I'm going to proceed with the visual inspection of the crime scene. Please do not bother me. Okay. All right. The first thing I noticed was, apart from the numerous wounds caused by the glass, the victim had a sunken chest and several broken bones. There's only one explanation for these injuries. The body was crushed by a large weight of some kind. Well, there wasn't any such object found in the cell. It was not an object but a person. Look. As the doctors know, a few weeks ago, a patient attacked me and died. What? Another death? And you didn't inform the police? One of the patients that you interviewed earlier, Ignacio Urquieta, has assured us that it was just an unfortunate accident. Urquieta lied to protect me. But after tonight's events, there's only one theory that would explain everything that's happened. The victim was the one who defended me. And his murderer witnessed it all. This was done by someone strong enough to lift up the victim off the floor... ...and crush his rib cage with his own weight. Calm down! Someone who had access to the murder weapon. And above all, someone with motive. - Motive? - Heartbreak. Have you seen Alicia Almenara? Nothing drives men madder than unrequited love. Romulus took away the only girl that he loved. And then, he took away the only friend he ever had. And that ignited his need to act. If you examine him, you will find cuts on his hands caused by the glass. He must have cut himself when he killed him. Do you think her theory makes sense? The truth is that Romulus and the Elephant Man fight a lot. Go check it out. Look for scratches on his face or other parts of his body. The victim may have struggled and scratched him while he was trying to... to defend himself. No, he didn't. The only marks he'll have... will be the ones on his hands. Come with me. Show us your hands. Everything happened just as she said. Someone explain what the fuck's going on. I am a private investigator. I'm being held here against my will. Take me to the station. I'll explain everything to you. You will not go anywhere without a medical discharge. I'm responsible for the murder of that boy. Romulus would still be alive if I hadn't tried to escape. You're the patient who claims to have been kidnapped? No one's been kidnapped here, inspector. Well, this very afternoon, one of your doctors came to the station to report the opposite. This particular patient was admitted voluntarily and under medical diagnosis. - What she says about her husband is false. - No. She's right about the money. We looked into it today. It's true her husband did empty out all of her bank accounts. The transaction could be carried out because the account holder was incapacitated. I can't get you released, but I'll talk to the judge. You're making a mistake, inspector. My mistake was listening to you. Remember what you said? That things that are important should never have to change? Well, one of those things is a policeman's sacred duty... to find out the truth. Please, come with us. Yeah. Yeah, come with us. We'll take your statement. Where is Arellano? A copy of the letter I'm sending to the city council asking for you to be removed. - We have all signed it. - You have no authority, Montse. - She was fired earlier today. - Well, it wasn't officially recorded. So I'll see you there tomorrow. And where is that? A special meeting of the medical board. To discharge Alice Gould. The next time this gate opens, it will be to let you out. Montse, can I ask you one last thing? He had an anxiety attack, and we brought him here as a precaution. Can I be alone with him? - Sure. - Thanks. What a horrible night. I was so terrified. For a moment, I thought that... I had lost you. But I knew you'd come back to protect me once and for all. Same as you protected your sister. And your brother, Remus. They may mix you up, but a mother always recognizes her son. Tell me what happened. Remus. Take it easy. Take it easy, Remus. - Fire! Fire! - You're okay. Okay? - Come on. - Fire! - I'll be right back, okay? - Don't move. Stay right here. It was all my fault. Yes. I should've been there. No, my love. It wasn't your fault. - Will you stay here with me? - I can't. - I'm sorry. - Mother, please. I don't belong here. But I'll visit you whenever I can. Whenever I can. Are you ready? Those glasses. You were right. The others were out of style. Much better. Thanks. Will we meet again? You're not tired of me? See you at the meeting. Please have a seat. Miss Alicia de Almenara, are you aware of the reason that brings you before this board? To attend a trial. We here are psychiatric doctors. We do not pass sentences. The trial I refer to is not mine, doctor. Tell me, Alicia, how many times have you lied since being admitted here? Countless times. Are you in the habit of lying? No, doctor. In two months alone, I've accrued enough lies for an entire lifetime. I assure you all here that honesty has always been my guiding principle. As it is now and it will be when I am discharged. Although we are waiting for the inspector to find your fugitive husband, the evidence suggests that you have been kidnapped and sent here. That you were the victim of a conspiracy by him. We know as of this morning that he has taken your money and sailed to South Asia weeks ago. Heliodoro left no loose ends. And then Dr. Donadío conveniently disappeared in Zurich. The fake García del Olmo hired me deceptively, and here I am, locked away and begging for my sanity. Now, how will you proceed here? All of you. In order to make your discharge effective, this board must vote and agree unanimously. It seems my fate is still being controlled by Dr. Alvar. You're right about that. I am still the director of this institution, and therefore, my vote is still valid. Then I will plead for your decency to avoid an injustice, doctor. It has been proven that your diagnosis of my condition was wrong. The only thing that's been proven is that your husband took your money. But did he do it by hatching a sinister plan to have you admitted here or after you tried to poison him? That is your resentment talking, doctor. Do you know what's wrong with you? You cannot stomach that a woman has challenged your authority in front of everyone here. Your abusive methods have been questioned by me and also by your patients. And to the point of turning this hospital against you. If you oppose my discharge, you will only demonstrate an unprofessional vindictiveness that will end up destroying you. Believe me. Consider what you've just shown us. What would that be? The extreme superiority complex that you have. The one that has led you to psychoanalyze me and that has moved you to attempt to end your husband's life. You're a sick woman, Alicia. Manipulative and dangerous. Even if none of my colleagues seem to realize it. But don't worry. I won't be the one to contradict them. Ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of coherence and dignity and because I refuse to believe that you've lost your judgment altogether, I will now withdraw my vote and will accept your decision. Are you sure? It's up to you to protect the reputation of this institution. And I only ask that if you finally decide to declare Alicia de Almenara sane, you destroy that letter where you disqualify me and ask for my expulsion and replace it with this one instead. It is addressed to the minister of health. He put me in this role, and I owe it to him. In this letter, I present my resignation for personal reasons, and I ask that he leave it to the medical board of doctors to elect a new man to lead you. Or a lady in this case. Are there any objections? We accept your conditions. Anything else before we vote? Yes. You've lost sight of a very important thing. Our confidence in the criterion of medicine. In this case, the judgment of Dr. Donadío. Do you remember what the man said? Think about it. Are you going to let your diagnosis depend on the lies of a sick woman? Think about it. Let us proceed with the voting. Let us vote yes or no to the question. Should Alice Gould de Almenara be declared mentally healthy? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This decision could be the biggest mistake this board has made. I'm just glad... that it's no longer under my responsibility. I told you this was a trial. Just not mine. And for you, I only feel profound sorrow. This board accepts your resignation. You can go get your things, Samuel. By the way, last night I got a call from Dr. Donadío. It turns out that after the congress in Zurich, he went on a trip with his wife. There was no conspiracy. He never received any of our correspondence. I asked him if he could come and clarify this matter, and he very kindly agreed. Have a good day. Thank you so much for coming. It's my pleasure to help you, Dr. Alvar. Shall we enter? I'd rather you go in alone. Hello, Alice. What kind of trouble are you in now?
