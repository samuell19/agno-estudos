"Misdeeds I have done, I do and will do. Wicked, I am. Sin, is in my nature." "Whatever misdeeds I may do, to accept me, is in God's nature." "Anytime I see a wilted crop, I wither, too.", says Vallalar. Even a small being like a fly or an ant has a meaningful life! It has a father, mother, spouse and children, too! God will not tolerate the unnecessary killing of these beings! Let there be the light of life! If we live by the ways of Saint Vallalar, we will have eternal life! 'Let there be the light of life!' It has a father, mother, spouse and children, too! 'Without a hint of intolerance...' 'Considering all life precious as one's own life...' 'Delighting in bestowing equally one's goodwill on all...' In such a person's heart, the epitome of wisdom, Lord Shiva... ...dwells to perform his cosmic dance, I realize. Your respect for such small life forms, will earn you all riches in life! What is your name, my boy? Anjanam Azhagiya Pillai! You were right, Anjanam! A transformer near the Amman temple broke down! Very well. Please fix it. Marry a man in the electricity board and you'll never have a power cut! Get his phone number! He works in Chennai, right? Yes, sir. Great that you have links in our EB office, too! I'm from Thanjavur, too! Worked here for three years! Is that so? What's wrong? -The call isn't going through! She said she'd return at three when she left home. How long have you been in Chennai? Just two or three years! Isn't that right? No... it's been eight years! I've given my Facebook profile. Check it out! You can learn everything about me! That's not it! Got your own house, right? No... -No? It is better if you buy one! We'll discuss this with our daughter and let you know. What is this, son? We haven't even seen the girl! Let's just leave, mom. I'll take your leave. Thank you very much. Hello, boss. The bill, voucher and collection. See you tomorrow. -Alright. Get going. The cops are coming! Don't get caught! Hey! You waste quite a lot of water! "Lot of water"? Like we even get any! Indeed! How much do I struggle for water? I have it dug up to 1,000 feet! What's the big idea wasting so much water? I ask you a question and you're just leaving! I'm talking to you and you're taking off! You're going to pull fuses, right? Go right ahead! You're here, Anjanam? Water pouring in your house, huh? She's telling me not to waste a lot of it! It flows as thin as piss! Find another house! The bride's family always asks if I own a house. Hey, I just remembered! What happened this time? Why even ask? Before, the girls would look at me and reject. Now, they run away without even seeing me! She got away, huh? Seems pretty smart! Damn, he heard that! I blurted out the truth! So buy a house! They may reject us for our faces, but they won't, if we own a house! Own house, right? -No... You waste a lot of water! I ask you a question and you're leaving! I own this house! Really think so? The house must be beautiful! The street must be wide! It must be really breezy! There must be a tree and a cuckoo atop it! Most importantly, it mustn't be very expensive! Then you can only buy a house in Thanjavur! Yes, mom? We went to see a girl, right? -See? Well, we went to meet one, right? Yes. -They rejected us! Just figured it out, huh? They didn't even show the girl! Who do they take us for? That didn't work! Why needlessly talk about them? Hang up! "I must let go of lustful desires for women!" "You must always live in my thoughts, O God!" Want to see a flat in Pallikaranai? "Give me knowledge. Shower me with mercy! Give me a life free of ailments!" There's a flat like you wanted on the eighth floor. It'll be ready in a month! Tambaram is just 50 kilometres from here! You wanted trees and cuckoos, yes? Rainwater won't stagnate here! "Serene faced God, who shuns killing! O mighty Shanmugha!" "Let there be the light of life! Absolute benevolence to all!" Let someone show me a good house, at least today! Come, sir! I'll show you! The 'sir' is here! Get going, 'sir'! Get going! Think he's all that! How do you live with her? -I just rent her place! One sightsees a town or sees a house. I've never seen one who sightsees houses all over town! How many more? -Going to live in it forever, yes? Got to be sure, right? -Sorry, I'm late! Let's go! What is it, sir? Enter with the right foot forward! "Let there be the light of life! Absolute benevolence to all!" An excellent house built just for you, sir! I've brokered deals for many clients, but I've never found them such a house! A guy lived here, once. He's really gone places! Look at the North entrance! How beautiful is this kitchen! Plenty of positive energy here for kids to study! If they do so, they'll find a job abroad! How many kids do you have? I'm not even married yet! -Not married? Aren't you an engineer? Nowadays, no one's willing to wed an engineer! The thing is, you earn a lot! You'll definitely find a beautiful wife! With the blessings of Goddess Mahamayi, a fine girl will come light up your life! Phone's ringing. Answer it. -That's your phone, sir. Hello? Who is it? This is Mekala speaking. You came to my house for a bridal alliance, yes? So many alliances! Which one is this? From Thanjavur... Oh, Mekala! It's you? Tell me! I'm sorry. I wasn't home when you came by for the alliance. I had an unavoidable task. That's why, I... It's alright. What would've happened? I would have heard this apology in person. That's all! I'm really sorry! You don't need to feel so bad! I've had plenty such experience! As you're being so frank, I'll tell you the truth. They showed me your picture. It wasn't any unavoidable work! I just left. After your visit, I thought about it. I felt really guilty! You travelled very far to meet us! I should've at least showed up, right? I was wrestling over whether or not to call you. I thought I should talk to you today! That's why I called! I feel much better now! Delighted! -Why? Because I made you feel better, right? Did you get to see my picture? No one showed me your picture. What if you see my picture and not like what you find? I wasn't raised to have likes and dislikes. Whatever I get, I will like. How about that? He's spinning crazy! So that's how you take a good look around a house? A fine girl will come light up your life! The house will bring you luck! 'I feel unabounded love!' 'My quest ends here!' 'Time changes for good!' So you're in B-2? I'm in A-2. 'I see a bright future!' -Mustn't hear a peep from you, okay? 'A dream became a reality!' 'The heart soared as if on wings!' "Anytime I see a wilted crop, I wither, too". You taught me so! 'I shall welcome sprightly squirrels into my house!' 'I shall cook small dishes of food, with love!' 'I shall gift this new light, swirling in the kitchen!' 'I shall enjoy solitude in the divine light of of life!' 'The sky from yesterday runs and hides like a cat!' 'Time rests on an easy chair and smiles away.' 'Gained a life and a home!' 'My longing began to materialize in the form of bricks!' 'I will demand the dawn to be born, to relish it!' 'I will be engrossed in the music of chirping crickets!' 'I will lie atop the light on the floor as a petite shadow!' 'I will enjoy these rooms, even in my greying years!' 'Even when the drizzle ceases, the moisture in the air stays behind.' 'Even as time goes on, it becomes etched in my vision.' 'My soul is in waiting!' 'My soul came by and stood on my doorstep!' The rusk vanished the other day too, right? There were two of them. I ate one. I'm the only one here, right? The rusks often tend to go missing! "Let there be the light of life! Absolute benevolence to all!" There's a problem at JCS Jewelry. Please check it out. -Alright, sir. Can you come along? What? Why'd you come like this? I've come properly, haven't I? -Good grief! How did you know? She told me! -"She"? How do you know her? -Through the phone! No matter who calls, you'd flirt it out, eh? I am Anjanam Azhagiya Pillai! You had complained about power problems. Tell me! Mylapore Electricity Board? -Yes! Is that where you work? -It's not that bad a job! I had filed the complaint! I'm sorry. Thought this was about something else! How many sorrys? Even if you had wantedly spoken to us so, that's no issue. Yes. No charges or damages! Had you wanted us to buy jewelry, that'd have been hard. Yes, mom? That girl works in Madras, too! Which girl? Can't you be more specific? The girl from our town. The one that never showed up! Oh... her! So what if she works here? No, son. She says she wants to meet you! Shall I decline? -Hold it, mom! You mustn't say such things! She requests to meet me. Must I not oblige... What is that? It wasn't me! Hey, you! Don't bite me! I am not even married, yet! A rat! I was scared of this? Maddening noises in the newly bought house! Imagine what it'd be like! It turned out to be a rat! Only now, I feel at peace. At peace for what you saw, or because she saw you? Hey! Shut up! Rusks often go missing in the house! The rat's behind that, too! What? A rat? You say it like it's no big deal! Be careful, sir! Why hype up such a small rat? "A small rat"? Don't speak like that! In our old house, there was a rat! It was really brilliant! It would wait until nightfall. No one knows when and how it would show up. We'd find out in the morning that it had chewed up the rice sacks! So we put the rice in containers on top shelves. Don't know if the lack of rice angered it... ...for it made a big mess of the kitchen! We locked all the doors and windows. Then we figured where it came from. Where did it come from? It came from the toilet, sir! And then what else? We tried baiting it with biscuits and poisoned dry fish. It didn't fall for any of it! We had to vacate the house! Oh, stop it! You're just spinning tales! There was a huge problem at a Japanese nuclear plant, yes? What caused it? Rats! Tiny rats! Is that her? Yikes! Can't tell which one is her! I'm Mekala... ...'s friend, Vanathi. She is Mekala. You'd shake anybody's hand, eh? I'm sorry! I thought she was you... I'm sorry! You talk one way on the phone and another in person! I'm not that kind of person! As we walked in, who did you think was Mekala? Be honest. I thought it was you. Which one of us is beautiful? Why question me as if I'm a little boy? We came to meet, not to fight, right? We're meeting and talking! Not singing a duet, yes? Don't I need to know the kind of person you are? Tell the truth! I don't know truth or lies. Whatever we feel within, is the truth. I feel that you're beautiful. Then isn't that the truth? I don't know what 'beautiful' means to you. But you're Mekala. That'll suffice. So, you're the most beautiful thing in the world to me. Why are you telling me that? Tell Mekala. Aren't you Mekala? I am Mekala. Rosie! -Who is Rosie? Come here or I'll whack you! -Why does this lady always call for her? You're disobeying me a lot as of late! What work do you have at the neighbor's house? Come here! You say it like it's no big deal! Be careful, sir! Quite a deadly rat! 'Leap and run up, down and all across, pounce to strike, we will!' 'Sniff out a fragrant home and rob it blind, we will!' 'We cannot bear hunger! We cannot cook, either!' 'Cold leftover rice will suffice! We won't rest until we get a taste!' 'Brats! Incredible brats!' 'Listen to the tales of our mischief!' 'Yarns! Newly spurn yarns!' 'These will run for days!' 'Climb up on pipes and scratch paper plates, we will!' 'We belong to the dynasty of Spider-Man!' 'Assemble late at night and dance jigs, we will!' 'We're as rad as Michael Jackson!' 'Sneak into the spice rack to seek out the spices, we will!' 'As we make off with the loot, the cooker whistle shrills!' 'As the wheels spin amidst freight trucks, we feel no fear!' 'Our only fear is one that purrs all day!' 'Got evil plans to steal, we do! No Goods and Services Tax for that! 'What can your law do to us?' 'We've never feared anything nor have we begged anyone!' 'Your system kills us!' 'We won't annoy you by announcing our arrival!' 'We won't flap our gums and brag about our exploits!' 'Brats! Incredible brats!' 'Listen to the tales of our mischief!' 'Yarns! Newly spurn yarns!' 'These will run for days!' 'Leap and run up, down and all across, pounce to strike, we will!' 'Sniff out a fragrant home and rob it blind, we will!' 'We cannot bear hunger! We cannot cook, either!' 'Cold leftover rice will suffice! We won't rest until we get a taste!' 'Brats! Incredible brats!' 'Listen to the tales of our mischief!' 'Yarns! Newly spurn yarns!' 'These will run for days!' Hey, Rosie! Won't catch rats, huh? Only imported food! And they call you a cat? Lovely! "Are you still up"? "I'd really like to see you." You're incredibly beautiful. I can't say the same! Why crush me to bits? If you speak from the dark terrace, how can I see you? That's true! Why are you lying there? That's a sad story! Way too much trouble with a rat at home! Trouble with a rat? Yes! So you're sleeping on the terrace. Did the rat ever go to sleep on the terrace because of you? No... -Then what? No one is a trouble to anyone else. This world is for all life forms. If one adjusts a little, everyone can be happy! I do adjust! Can't bear the torture of the crunching it does all night! It's like I bought a 50 lakh house just for a rat! That's not right, either! If a thief comes into your house, would you just give up and leave? How will the problem get solved? That's true! -Tried a rat trap? Like that'll work! I can't even find out from where it comes and goes! You don't know from where it comes and goes... Alright. Try this! Is he an EB employee or a lunatic? Buy five rat traps! Place a nicely roasted piece of coconut in each trap! Keep each trap in separate rooms! Lock all the rooms! Whichever room the rat is in, it'll come, eat and get trapped! Mekala was right! So this is where you are! Doesn't matter if I go hungry! You stay in here! Mommy's calling you, right? Come here, you idiot! Oh, she meant you! Haven't eaten yet? -Not hungry. When you should be playing with your kids, your love life is beginning! You won't feel hunger! My body aches, man! Shall we go to the hospital? There's still time for that! Wow! Rusks! Give me a couple! It's a rat! How is that possible? I locked it up in the room! What? You locked up the rat in a room? -Yes! Which room? -The kitchen! Who gave you that brilliant idea? The lady at the jewelry store? Yes. -I figured! Such a bright idea! What's wrong? It's nothing. Met the Secretary yesterday. He said the Assembly is convening. He asked for status reports on newly installed LED lights... ...transformers and pillars from our division. What? He's building a dam in his mouth! What is this, man? Rat fever! Haven't heard of it, huh? Lot of trouble with rats, eh? Must be careful! Very unhygienic! Rat urine could've spread from anywhere! Water, food, you name it! You admitted him at the right time! If it wasn't diagnosed, it could've been fatal! He'll be fine in a few days. Be careful with the rats! So much power within such a tiny rat? "Tiny", eh? It can give birth in four weeks! Did you know that? The rat's a mighty mickey, huh? You get going. I'll take care of him. It's alright. I'll take care of him. How can you stay here... Take care of him. What's it to me? Take care of yourself. It's a private room. Small bed, too. You'd end up ranting about certain 'accidents'. Yes, mom? Doing well? -Yes! Saw the girl? I'm seeing her right now. What? I saw her! -What's she like? She's nice. What does that mean? Such an empty statement! By that, I mean she's very nice! Wholesome. Beautiful. Will that do? What else do you want? Oh my! Nothing else, son. Her father's asking if we can have the engagement next week! What's wrong? Haven't said a word! Just the thought of something good ever happening to me... ...leaves me speechless. Alright then. Smile! 'In the fading light of the evening, on the bank of the river...' '...surfaced a moon!' 'My moon surfaced!' 'I wish to speak to her for days on end!' 'But the words seem to get snared on my tongue!' 'Like the beam of light upon a river...' '...you fell into my life!' 'I raced and rolled over!' 'In the fading light of the evening, on the bank of the river...' '...surfaced a moon!' 'My moon surfaced!' 'Atop the terrace, I fell as a drop of rain!' 'On dusty cobwebs, I see butterflies flutter!' 'A feeling I have never known lulls me to sleep!' 'All day, every day, my heart wishes only for that!' 'On mere ashes, the footprints of a flower paint patterns of beauty!' 'In the fading light of the evening, on the bank of the river...' '...surfaced a moon!' 'My moon surfaced!' 'Who knows who joins hands with whom under this raining sky?' 'Who knows whose umbrella shades whose soaring heart?' 'Days went by, shut like a closed door!' 'Like space devoid of a door, comes by, a new day!' 'I lived as a kite. Upon my threshold, comes along love!' 'In the fading light of the evening...' You've come this far. Care for some tea? Come in! A rat did this? No one believes me when I tell them. Here you go! There's no tea powder, either. I keep running to the store like an errand boy! I should've protested when offered tea at home! Like they're sweeping at the railway platform! A little... -What? There's no sugar, huh? I figured! Just making tea, right? You're making it strong! Carry on! Keeping it shut like this is what causes trouble! Leave it open. The house is fine. Why haven't you bought any furniture? Where would you seat visitors? Tell me what to buy and we'll do it. Over here! A small dining table. And here... -Yes? A plastic armchair! -Right! Over there... Wind chimes! Ah... -Made of bamboo! And here... A lovely sofa. What kind of sofa? I really like Stanley sofas! What does that mean? A premium sofa! Incredibly soft. Very comfortable. Oh so heavenly! It's awesome! I had always wanted to buy these things for my future home. Is that what you want? To each their own. But we tend to spend most of our day on the sofa, right? That sofa must be special, right? Sugar. Yuck! A rat can do much damage? Could've had tea at the shop! For this, I bought tea and sugar, huh? Let's find out who's the winner, today: You or me! I have a surprise! -What is it? What are you going to do? So many bad things happened because of you. A lot of good things, too. If not for you, would Mekala have spent a whole day with me? Here you go. This is an important report. For the Assembly session. I'll be on leave from Monday. Give this to the Secretary. And give this one on Friday. What is he looking at? Hey! -Sir? The sofa is very nice, sir. A treat for just catching a rat? A sofa store? What are we doing here? I like Mekala. Mekala likes sofas very much! Both of you are freaking crazy! Know how much sofas cost here? -I don't care how much! Cool with it being 50 thousand! It costs five lakhs, sir! Just five lakhs? Plus Goods and Services Tax! Ten lakhs, sir! Twelve lakhs, sir! At a little lower price... How much? 50... Even 55 thousand is fine! Our starting price sofa! How much? -50 thousand! One lakh, fifty thousand. We've come to the wrong place. Let's go! Come on! I really like the color red! How much is that red sofa? -Five and a half lakhs, sir. I'll take it. Can I pay in instalments? -Yes. Cross Chengalpet, you can get a house for eight lakhs! This is too much! -It's okay. Some buy a phone worth 50 thousand for a girlfriend. It falls and breaks the next instant! Mekala and I will sit on this for the rest of our lives! It isn't wrong to spend for that. Let's go. Why do this? -To let Mekala know! Don't tell her like this! Say you've bought a gift and invite her to see it. Really? This is when you must leap forward in a relationship! Like this? And you got a girl! Awesome, isn't it? Shall we sit and see? Sit down, buddy! Sit down! We're with sofa maintenance. If your sofa gets dirty, how would you clean it? What are you doing, sir? Got a vacuum? -I have a broom! Hold on, sir. Open it. Like to buy it? -How much? Cleaner, remover and towel altogether cost twenty five thousand. Offer price? Only nineteen thousand. Let's see how it gets dusty! Hello, sir! They sold the house you stayed in. A man from the electricity board lives there now. How have you been? One diamond is missing! Maybe someone took it? If they did, they would've taken them all! Why would they take just one? Looks like something bit away at this. The rat? Yes, mom? -How are you? I'm fine! -The wedding's fast approaching! When are you coming? -The invitations must be sent out. I'll leave soon. You and Mekala buy the wedding clothes on your way. Alright, mom. I'll be on leave from Monday. Give this to the Secretary. And give this one on Friday. Sir called you. -Which Sir? The Deputy Chief! -He said he wasn't coming today... Has he come? -Yes, sir. Said you wouldn't be in today! That's a sad story! While the CM was speaking, there was a power cut at the auditorium. Quite the uproar! So I cancelled everything and came back! Give me the reports, anyway. I'll give it to the Secretary myself. Here you go, sir. What is this? -What, sir? A rat has bitten this! A rat? No way! What do you call this? That was before... I got rid of the rat. Got the document on Friday. And kept it. Got rid of it. Got it. Kept it. Got rid of it. Got it. Kept it. Hey... I gave you another package! Is that at least safe? It contains a cheque worth 25 lakhs! Don't fail me now! Start up! Start up! Why you little... Like a good human being, I let you go, alive. Showed me your tricks, didn't you? You ruined the sofa that I lovingly bought for Mekala, didn't you? Why I ought to... You sounded very upset. It just made small holes, right? Can't you sit on this? Are you fine with a rat coming in through a hole and biting your nuts? Come! Mekala likes the sofa. So does the rat! Mekala likes you. So does the rat, too! She has bad taste. So does the rat! What is this... You didn't buy an independent house! This is a flat! Others live here, too! If you keep dropping stuff loudly... Sorry... -What the hell, man? Come lift it! -Called the service, right? So? Are you saying we can break it? It cost five lakh rupees! Move aside! It looks ugly out front. "Looks ugly"? My five lakh sofa looks ugly? It's awesome only when I hear you say it's five lakhs! Sorry. Blurting out the truth a lot today! Don't touch it! Move away! Quite the headache! Shall I make some tea? I can do it better than Mekala! You're going to have bad tea all your life! What do I care? -The lighter doesn't work! Use the matchstick! It's not lighting up! You can't even light up a stove! And you want to make tea? Common sense! Give me that! Some man, you are! Damn it! The cylinder! Go get a wet blanket! Hurry! Damn it! Oh no! Oh crap! My sofa! Hey, Ravi! Oh my! Hey! Hey, Ravi! My God! The sofa! Out of the way! -Bring it over! You jackass! Seal off the cylinder! What are you staring at? You said I couldn't make tea but you burned down the sofa! The fire is out! We put the fire out! Damn it! We put it out! The fire is out, man! The evidence is important! Hold still! Out of the way! There's water on the floor! Careful! What happened? -A rat bit the cylinder tube. We put it out! -The sofa was destroyed! You're safe, right? Is there a Mr. Anjanam here? -That would be me. Sofa service. A rat did bite it, sir! How can you tell? -Through the rat's urine! It reeks of ammonia! Rat urine! -So what? How does that mean it bit it? When a rat feels uneasy about something it eats, it pees right away! So, the other rats would not eat it. It's a form of communication among them! Would it eat diamonds? It can eat anything besides iron! What happens if it eats diamonds? -It'll come out in its poop. Or it'll stay in the stomach for ten to fifteen days. Is that right? A very expensive sofa, mom! He went above and beyond to buy it as the girl liked it. It's a pity! I'll sleep here and come in the morning. What's the point of staring at it? Come and sleep! Come along! You're coming to my house? -You told me to come on Saturday! Have you left already? We must get ready! Mekala's coming! We leave in five minutes! Can you wait for ten minutes? Almost done, here! Please! Hurry up! He talks as if I'm at the dining table! I lovingly bought this for her! Don't tell her anything if she asks! Fine! -She'll take it hard! We'll leave before she gets here! If so, how'll she ask when she comes? Don't answer the calling bell! What if I open the door as she presses the bell? Cover it properly! Mekala! I forgot to tell you! An urgent task came up... The door wasn't locked, huh? What is it? -What? You were saying something... What was I saying? -About an urgent task... That there are no urgent tasks today and it'll be nice if you came by! You're here and I'm so happy! Right? Oh, totally! Last night was so much fun! What else is special? What is this? The house is so dirty! What do we have here? Don't open it! That's his dirty laundry! Smells horrible in there! His underwear is in there! What else? What else? -Asked me to come on Saturday, right? The view from here on a Saturday is awesome! Want to see? Take a look! How beautiful it is! Just that... You said you bought something for me... Oh, that? I was just thinking about giving it to you! And you just asked for it! Close your eyes! He'll give it to you! Damn it! Why is it taking so long? There's no other go! It's lovely! Between his gifting and her accepting... ...Kohli and Anushka must take notes! Awesome, isn't it? Small and cute. It was pretty big! As it was packed tightly, it shrunk. Good grief! Careful... This sofa is very expensive! He bought it for you. It caught fire yesterday. I've never wished for anything for myself. Because it never comes true. I desired something for you. So I bought this. I asked you to come here so I could surprise you. That was ruined, too. Didn't you buy it for me? So what if it burned up? Would it not be a gift to me anymore? Must I go buy milk again? "High rise apartment on fire!" "Fatality caused by a rat!" "Firefighters to the rescue!" The house had caught fire. The fire department put it out. But you told us nothing! What if the cylinder had exploded and killed ten families? I asked you a question! Answer me! How much do I pay you? A pest control team came by Zackaria Colony. Only then, did the problem get solved. Why don't you try it? Their number... I'm an artiste, sir! He said he was making a film. I act very well! He snitched me out! -What? Alright, we'll see. We are from PA Pest Control Systems! I never thought you'd come so quickly! The cop told us! He told you, too? We made him tell us! We told him to refer to us anyone who needs pest control! Come in! Why do you look through the books? Rat hair might be anywhere! It'll help us find out how many rats are here! Just one rat, sir! Come on out! Even if smoke doesn't draw it out, the rat knows we are here! As long as we are here, it won't show up! What do we do? -Let's try sulfate! Thallium sulfate! It's very poisonous! They have banned it! If a rat eats it, it'll die in thirty seconds! What does the rat usually eat in this house? A rat? The rat will surely die this time! Call us once it does. We'll handle it. The rat ate the dried fish! And the rat? -It's missing! A rat that ate the poison would have died right there! Look around! It would not have gone far! I'm going out on an urgent task. -Don't worry! My boys will handle it! Alright? I'll leave the key with the watchman! -Okay. I'll take care. Search for the rat! It is here and so is the diamond! 'Like the sarus bird that mates for life, and never parts away...' '...we'll live without any dearth of love!' 'Eyes locked onto eyes, our hearts merged as one!' 'We shall revel in life's joys and sorrows!' 'The fragrance of an exotic flower fills the air as she walks along!' 'It will speak in jubilation!' 'Is she a golden yellow moon? Is she is a sweet-tongued flute?' 'Her beautiful self came before me!' Did you find the rat? -No, boss! Morons! You'll search for a damn rat for two days? Where is he? -He's eating! "Eating"? 'A lovely house... A nest of two parrots...' Couldn't you find the rat? -We searched all over! We don't know where it died! I smell something horrible! -The whole house stinks! That's why we couldn't find the rat. We'll get rid of it tomorrow! Excuse me! -Sir? Do you smell something bad? We just cleaned the place today with Dettol! No, this is different... Where is it coming from... What is he sniffing at? Why haven't you left yet? Given out all the invitations, right? I'm too afraid to go home! What are you saying? -That rat is lying dead in there! I can't get inside the place! I thought it was just a puny rat! That rat was killing me when it was alive and does so even after it's dead! You're always going on and on about the rat! Laughing, are you? I bought a house but can't live in peace there for a single day! Who ever understands my pain? It ate rusks. It ate tubes. It ate the sofa. As it eats through the whole house, I feel it's slowly eating into me, too! My whole mind has gone bonkers! When I tell my problem to others, they laugh at me! And hell, look at what even you say! Listen. The rat died, didn't it? The odor will be around for ten days, yes? Until that odor goes away, stay at my house! Come along! Some even live in graveyards! Quit brooding! Come! It's Mekala. Why didn't you answer my call? I'm at Ravi's house. My phone ran out of charge and turned off. Alright. Tried the outfit? Do you like it? What outfit? I tried it on. It was very nice! Are you even interested in this wedding? If I wasn't, would I've gotten engaged? Know how much I struggled to find a bride? How can you ask this? -Fine. What color is the suit? Is this how you ask me? -Why? Should I not ask you? Started with it? Already? What 'started with it'? You call it 'fighting' because I asked if the suit fits you? Would I ever say that the suit isn't good? Why repeatedly ask me so? What will you do if I tell the truth? You needn't wear the suit to the reception! Will the reception not happen if I don't wear that suit? I'm already peeved about not going home and she's nagging me about the suit! You're about to tell me that we're going home. Come on. Let's go home! Open it! Way too much hype! Welcome! Some even live in graveyards, right? There you go! Come! It's awesome! A hole! -Where? New fashion? I can see the underwear! I can see the underwear! Whose? -Your grandfather's! Your underwear, man! There's a hole in the pants! How did this happen? Aren't you dead, yet? Over there! -Look properly and strike! Over here! Over here! It's coming closer! Hit carefully! Whack it! Where's the rat? What are you staring at? Idiot! Get over here, Ravi! Look! It's going near the TV set! Whack it! Come here! Have you no sense? Tell that old man to come back later! The rat is getting away! The rat is missing! I hear a sound! It's in the kitchen! Tell the old man to leave and come here! Whack it! If the rat didn't die, what did? It's time! Come! Hold on! I'll fix this and come! We'll come back and fix it! I'll get it! What is it, old man? Rosie is missing! It's been three days! Will you let me know if you see her around? I told you to kill that rat when we caught it! You didn't want to kill it, but now you've killed a cat! At least that's all it was. What if a child had eaten that rusk? No one can live in this world without killing any life! It's an era where those who don't kill cows kill humans! Think you're all that... It's a forest trap, sir! Before you go to bed, turn off the lights and switch this on. Scary, isn't it? -Incredibly strong setup, sir! Even if a snake's fangs touch it, instant death! You always seem to be in deep thought! Why? Last time too, we thought the rat would be killed. But a cat died. We're setting up an electric shock. I'm afraid there might be another accident! I have only one question. Must the rat die or not? Have you left? -Ravi and I are coming in a car. We'll reach in the evening. -Dad wants to know! Tell him I'll be there! I didn't want to kill even the tiniest life form. You turned me into a killer! It is fated that you will die at my hands! It doesn't have to die. It just must not come back. If it is killed, it won't come back! Shall I kill it? 'Without a hint of intolerance...' 'Considering all life precious as one's own life...' 'Delighting in bestowing equally one's goodwill on all...' Even a small being like a fly or an ant has a meaningful life! What happened, sir? Give that to me. I'll take care of it. No need, sir. I won't be at peace. God has given it life. Never mind. I'll set it free somewhere. Will you give it to me or not? Why do you threaten me? No, dear fellow. It swallowed my thirty lakh diamond! I must kill it and get the diamond out! Give it to me! The rat ate a diamond? So you're not with the pest control? Why tell such funny tales? The rat chewing up your sofa isn't funny, but it swallowing my diamond is? Had it eaten, would it not have pooped? If it had, wouldn't the diamond be in it? We searched the whole flat! We couldn't find it! You better give me that rat! 'I am going to run!' 'I am going to hide!' 'You can't catch me now!' 'I am going to run!' 'I am going to hide!' 'You cannot catch me now!' Let go of me! Why is he here? Always a ruckus in here! I'll call the cops! So much noise! What noise? Like you don't make any noise! I'll definitely call the cops! What are you gaping at? Call! Call the cops! Stop staring! Call the cops! I'll smack your head! Hello? Velachery police station? A man has hit me, sir! He always makes trouble, sir! My door number is A2! He's at B2! Always a ruckus in there! Real useless fellows, sir! Constantly a nuisance! Come quickly, sir! Let's go, boss! Let's leave! He won't let me do a ritual in peace! -Come, boss! Arrest him on nuisance charges! He must not be spared! -Come, boss! Hurry! -Come along, boss! Aren't you that smuggler? You're all a bunch of frauds, huh? No need for cops! I hit you to escape from them! Let the cops come! See what I do to you all! Damn! Your hair is messed up! Please don't mistake me! Who is Anjanam Azhagiya Pillai? Won't answer your phone, huh? The inspector from the Mandaveli precinct wants to see you! Go! Mandaveli? -Is that it, sir? He hit me, sir! He's leaving, boss! Start the car! Mandaveli precinct? -Won't come even after being told? I'm on my way! What happened? I left work after giving out wedding invitations. As they do every day, they checked my bag. All of a sudden, they pulled out a diamond from my bag! They asked me how it got there! I told them that I did not know! They kept asking me how it got there! What else could I tell them? I swore to them that I didn't know. No one believed me. So I tried to call you, but you didn't pick up, either! It just got really crazy! They're going over the CCTV footage! Tell me, sir. Oh, really? You've checked all the footage? Oh, so it's not yours! -Yes, tell her what I told you! Alright, I'll take care! -Hello! I'll let her know! Is this about that diamond? -Yes. I just told him about it. Come here! Mekala didn't take the diamond. It doesn't belong to the store, either. They verified it with the CCTV footage. You can show the bill and take back the diamond. Even if the bill is missing, we can get a copy. They say the diamond is worth thirty lakhs! Must the rat die? It swallowed my thirty lakh diamond! I must kill it and get the diamond out! The diamond was in our house but it isn't ours. Then whose is it? A rat, sir... If we leave quickly, we'll reach by evening. I need a small carry bag. How would I know? What for? I just need one! Don't ask me why! So that's why you kept coming back to this house! Not knowing this, I took the rat out of here. It's time! Let's get going! We'll toss them out on the way! We leave now, we'll reach by evening! Hurry! They keep calling from home! Why are you turning? Thanjavur is straight ahead! Come on! If I question him, he'll whine about not getting any empathy! What is it now? Subtitled at Subemy.
