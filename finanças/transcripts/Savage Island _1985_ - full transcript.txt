Oh, God. God. Oh, my God. Please, God. Help, please. Help! Mercy. Miss, would you sign in, please? Miss, everyone has to sign in. Hey, you, come here! Miss Daly? Mr. Luker's expecting me. Miss Daly's here. Miss Daly! At last we meet. How do you do? May I offer you some espresso, cappuccino, chardonnay? No, thank you. I'm fine. If we could maybe just... Getting down to business, huh? I can tell you're a woman who drives a hard bargain. What a marvelous piece you are wearing. I'm sure you will be most impressed with my selection. I've collected some exquisite stones for your perusal. Is there something wrong? What the... Sit down. Sit down! What is it you want? Jewels? Money? Who the hell are you? Let's just say a dissatisfied ex-employee. Well, I am certain I have never met you before in my life. Whatever the problem is, I'm... I'm sure we can straighten it out. I was your slave, Mr. Luker. Me and a hundred other women down in South America. Digging up your precious emeralds with our bare hands! I don't know what you are talking about. I procure my emeralds through middlemen. Middlemen who run the prison. And promise inmates shorter sentences in exchange for hard labor. What they don't tell you is that one week on your Emerald Island is like a thousand years in the shittiest South American hole! You're a raving lunatic! Maybe so. Thanks to you. I swore when I got out of there I'd get even. It took me two years to do this, and as of today, no more Emerald Island. Curious, huh? Well, I'm gonna tell you all about it. Every last detail. The beginning of the end was four days ago. The day the boat brought in the new prisoners. Only one of them was a plant. And she worked for me. It's been a long time. Think I could have a hit? It smells so good, Sarge. Nah, she's just a baby. Wouldn't like it. Green meat. You know what I'm talking about? Give her time. She'll be ripe soon. Apple a day. Here, I'm going forward. Take the tiller, Tomas. Tomas, I'm going up there. Okay. Hey, captain, how much longer on the jungle cruise? I'm getting seasick. Oh, won't be long now. This happens to be a river. It was the same setup as usual. Four soldiers and two boat crew. And the captain, Orinoko. I never could figure out why Orinoko did your dirty work bringing in the new prisoners, taking out your emeralds. He wasn't a cruel bastard like the rest of your men. I guess he and his crew just did it for the money. Like any good mercenaries. Got a little fire down below, huh? This stuff is rotten. It's putrid, like this jungle. Give me that bottle, duchess. Ahoy. Ruiz, take that. You feel better now? My throat's on fire. It'll pass. Want a slugof this, Tomas? Hmm. What's your name? Maria. What're you in for? For stealing diamonds from a fat old bitch and her sex-starved husband. I belonged to a gang, see. Diamonds, gold. Whatever paid well. I didn't really do so bad. I did okay. Come on, Tomas. We gotta be off the river by nightfall. Let's go. Keep an eye on forward, Ruiz. I'll watch the stern. Crossing the jungle to meet the boat when it docked was my other partner, Laredo, and his gang of jewel thieves. The plan was for them to kill the guards and force Orinoko to lead them to the prison camp. What we hadn't figured on was running into one of the armed squads that patrol your jungle. Hold it. It's this way. Stay close. Follow me. Spread out, it's an ambush! Where are they? I can't see them! Got one over there! Look over there! There's only a couple more! There's another one! Get him! Laredo. I got shot! Laredo. Paco, where were you hit? Here. Most of Laredo's men were killed in the ambush. His best friend, Paco, got hit in the shoulder. It slowed them down, but they carried Paco with them, hoping to find someone who knew how to extract a bullet. Orinoko docked for the night, and let his group into the jungle to his regular campsite. Well, here we are. Home sweet home. So, this is where we're going to bed down tonight, ladies. Sleep tight. Tomas, come on! What? Make yourself useful. Break out the double beds for these ladies. You know, the feather mattresses, everything. That's it. Now, Achilles, I think I'll retire for the night. Tomas, wake me up around 07:00. Hmm. And don't forget the bacon and eggs and a cup of scalding hot coffee. Oh, I'll remember, captain. Not too bad. Nothing like clean sheets. Maria went to work on the head guard. Well, well. I'd better go with her. I am responsible for her, you know. Oh, sure thing, Sarge. But if you need a little help, I'll be right with you. You talk too much, old man. I don't like your jokes. Remember who's in charge. You watch your step, or you'll answer to me. Now, you listen, Sergeant. And listen good. Tomas works for me. I'll take care of my crew. You stick to guarding the prisoners. You got it? Can I have just one puff? Is that all you want, Maria, huh? Mmm. Like silk. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You like it, huh? Yes. Let me see how it is to be a woman again. Are you afraid? I'm not afraid of anything. You're going to remember this for a long time. We'll do it right here. Let me look at you first. Yeah. Maria, it's me, Laredo. How many guards are there? What took you so long? There are three of them. Shh! Right over there. Draw them over here. Help, guards! Guards! Hurry up! The sergeant's been bit. Hurry up! How the hell did you get here? How did you get past my sentries? Nobody could do that. You're crazy. Who are you guys, anyway? He's hut bad. He took a bullet in his shoulder. He needs a doctor. Let me take a look. Hmm, it's gotta come out. Do we have any supplies here? No way. Let's go. Okay. Lead us there. We'll take him to the boat. Well, you've got some supplies there. Hold him still. Clench your teeth good and tight, Paco. That way you won't feel it so much. - Here, bite on this. - Hold him. Man of strength and courage. Doesn't look too good, Orinoko. Give me some gauze. Pass me the pinchers. Just one more minute. And the alcohol. Hurry it up girl, will you? Okay. Look the other way. Come on. There we are. It's bleeding. Got it. What a bullet. To infiltrate the camp, disguised as the soldiers, Laredo had to have Orinoko's help. The warden and his right-hand man, Jordan, trusted Orinoko. They should have known better. We lost most of our men in the ambush, but we can still accomplish our mission. But I'd like to ask if you'd join with us. Oh, yeah, so what you want is for me to risk my neck. You want my answer? It depends on the end. You'd be paid very well. Then you know my answer. Posing as guards, we'll infiltrate the camp. Jordan knows and trusts you, doesn't he? In a day or two, when their backs are turned, we'll sneak out the emeralds. So the deal was set. And my friends were about to enter the belly of the beast. Keep your eyes peeled. Dig through every inch of that mud. If you see anything that looks like an emerald, holler. Dig deep. Dig! Work today. Work, work! Come on. Get off your ass! Get over there! Hey, hey, wait a minute. Hold it. You haven't found a rock in three days. Now keep looking! You're not through yet. You gotta find some more first. Any one of you girls who finds a precious stone will get double rations today. If you don't, you get nothing! Come on, ladies, come on! Stay on the other side with that bucket. Look, you give me any more orders, I'm gonna throw this bucket right in your face. Just try it and I'll split your head wide open with... Oh, bullshit! Come on, come on! Get over there! Come on! Come in! You're not bringing me good news. Yeah. Another bad batch. This is it? The company's gonna shut us down. Let 'em do it. There are no more emeralds here anyway. This island is rich with emeralds. It's up to you to push the women harder. And I don't care how you do it. Look, if the prison would send us more prisoners, we'd have better results. These women are useless. We can only push them so far. If I was in charge, I'd push them till they dropped. Well, you're not in charge. You're too soft, Cesare. Oh, shut up, you two! We can't send Orinoko back with this batch. Or would you rather be working this job for free? It's Orinoko with the new prisoners! Well, Orinoko, you finally got here! I think so. How are you, Mr. Jordan? That's him. Follow me. Tomas,check this out. Well, how are things going in this harem of yours, Mr. Jordan? Everything okay, huh? Yeah, yeah, I've seen better. Look, I want you to meet Sergeant Laredo. How do you do? Okay. Come. That'd be all, Cesare. These new prisoners are a difficult bunch. The company ordered us to stay here and help you break them in. Just in case. What news do you bring from the outside world? Same old crap. You can take the world and shove it for all I care. Just give me my boat, women, and plenty of cash. You'd peddle your mother's body for a nickel. Hey, that's no way to talk! Get off my back! You and me have worked together for years. We know each other. We got a lot in common. You know, you're full of shit, Orinoko. Ah. Hey, Sarge, uh-uh. Look, but don't touch. There's a large fortune right there in those bags. Phew, I don't know how you can eat this yuck! Cool it! Don't cause trouble. Hey, you! What's the matter? Don't you like our menu? Well, you'd better eat it, or I'll rip your skin off. I'd rather be skinned alive than eat this slop. Listen, kid, you just got here so I'll forget it. Otherwise, I'd have you licking it up with your tongue. Now get to the showers! You smell like garbage! Come on, you girls, get in there! Come on, move it! Come on! Get in there. We don't have a lot of water. So no beauty baths. Move it! Move it! Come on, get in there! Move it! Come on, hurry up! Come on! Get in there! Get it over with! Okay, everybody out! Move it! Now it's my turn. I owe you four. Maria expected the worst from the guards there. But nothing could prepare her for the women she'd meet. Hey, I brought you another friend for your cell. She's worse than the rest of you. Fucking women! Get in there! When did you get here? Around an hour ago. Listen. I'm the leader in this cell, and if you do as I tell you, things won't be too bad for you here. What is your name? Maria. You can sit down. That's enough. Let's play. Seven. And that's your bunk. What's your sentence? Ten years. And, of course, you are innocent. No. Well, an honest girl. You gotta learn not to think about your past. It's no good. This is your new life, and you better get used to it, Maria. So you know who your roommates are. Mary, six years for illegal prostitution. Muriel, 20 years for premeditated murder. And I got life for killing my girlfriend. We'd better all get real familiar with one another. We're gonna live together in this damn prison for quite a long time. We all have to give and be amiable, so we can love each other. Especially when they leave us alone in the cell at night. You bitch! You guys are gonna get us in trouble. Get off me! Stop it! Cut it out! Stop it! Guys, stop it. We're gonna get in really big trouble if you don't stop now! Come on! Get in there! They're fighting again. I told you guys. What the hell is going on in here? Calm down! Take it easy! We'll give it to you! Hang 'em on a tree. What you see here is only an example of what you'll get. You must never provoke any disorder, understand? This is a prison camp. We have laws and regulations and they must be obeyed. The punishment from now on will be more severe. Much more drastic for all those who create disorder of any kind! In the barracks, when you work. I don't like using strong-arm methods but if there were no discipline in a prison camp there would be total chaos. So it is my duty as warden here to see to it that law and order be kept at all times! Any one of you who violates my laws will be punished severely. Now let me remind you that each one of you is serving a sentence for having committed some crime in the outside world, and you are now being punished for it! I have here some letters and lovely post cards from the outside world. I can't imagine how they managed to find their way out here. We are miles from civilization. But I changed my mind about distributing this mail to you because of what happened last night. And you can forget getting any news at all! For any of you! And I don't give a damn! Now, work, all of you! All right, let's go. You all heard what the warden said. Come on, move it, move it! Move your ass, Blondie! Come on, I don't have all day! Go, bitches! Come on, move it! All right, move it, hey! Come on, ladies, get the lead out. Come on, it's time for another day in the sun. Come on, get in there. Come on, move it! Move it along, my beauty queens! Come on! Let's get out there, let's do it! Come on! Hey, come on. Let's get some work done. We gotta dig here. We gotta get some of those emeralds. Dig! Come on! All right! Hey, little girl, watch out! Huh? There's snake in the water! All right, baby. Come on. What are you... Oh, boy. The little girl needs loving now. Yeah, yeah, right here in the bushes. Come on, baby. You'll love it. Thanks. Tell me, how's Maria? She was beaten pretty bad. But she'll make it. Why? Why are you being so nice to us? I just wanna help. Why, why do you ask? Because no guards ever helped us. I hate to see you women suffer so. You're prisoners, not animals. Prisoners, guards, we're beasts. Everyone's an animal. Conditions here are worse than I expected. The guards are insane. The women don't stand a chance against these bastards. We have to do something to help these prisoners. The guards outnumber us six to one, and they're well-armed. But I think we must revolt. We have no more time to wait. We must act. Let's blow this place off the map. It'll be a risky operation. Gentlemen, take it easy. We gotta follow our original plan. We grab the diamonds and then we take off. Swell. But you don't have a vote here, friend. I'm with Paco. Let's blow it up. Yeah, dynamite is my specialty. Then we agree? First, we wait for the opportunity. Don't forget that you're guards now. So act like it. No one learns of our new plan. And no fighting at all until I tell you. Is that clear? That's it. It's as clear Asa 20 carat gem. Kate, don't you ever think about breaking out of here? Listen, when you've been here as long as me, you don't think about it anymore. I mean, who cares? Water. Hey, give me some water. My throat's killing me. All right. Hey, you want any? No. I don't think I'll last long here. I can't get used to this. Wait a minute. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, what are you up to? I was looking for some roots. It's not forbidden, is it? Not when we are rest. Why would you be looking for roots? To eat them. I'm still hungry. Oh, Muriel, you'll have all the food you can eat if you'll just play along. Let go of me! Hold it! She's just like an animal. Yeah, a wild animal that needs to tamed. Leave me alone! You two will never have me! Oh, you hear that, Adolpho? We'll have her all right. You'll see, Cesare. The more you resist, the more you excite us. I'm not giving in. Leave me alone! Muriel, look at this. This'll make you change your mind. Now tell us that you'll do everything we want you to do. I'll count to five. If you don't tell us by then, I'll throw this snake in your face. One, two, three, four. You filthy bitch! You think you're tough. I oughta stuff it down your throat. You have a lot of courage, Muriel. The girls look up to you, right? Yes, they believe in me. I bow down to nobody. As long as I have my courage, I'll fight. And to fight for their freedom and yours, will they help you? Help? What do you mean? I was brought here by jewel thieves disguised as soldiers. Do you understand? Jewel thieves. I don't understand. Is this a joke? No. If they're gonna fight for our freedom, well, then, we'll organize the women and fight beside them. Hey, what's the matter with you today? Don't you feel like working? You bunch of good for nothing bitches! Come on, move it! You gotta work today. Work! Work! Quit fucking around, fat ass! Pick it up and carry it. All right, you two. Come on, now fill up that wheel barrow. We ain't got all day. We gotta get moving. Let's go, go! Hey, if you're not finished by sundown, you gotta go straight to your bunks without any chow. Now, get moving off your ass! Go! Muriel,Kate, look. What did you do? I cut my hand. Are you all right? Here, let me see. Do you feel pain? Yes, so much. Do I have to look after you cunts every second? Get back to work! Oh, I hate that bitch. She was one of us, and she's on their side. You'd better listen to what I say. You got it? Are you all deaf? Did you hear me or not? What are you doing? Are you playing with yourselves? I said get to work! Now, did you hear me? We didn't hear you. She just fell down. Let me see that. Ah, wash it off and get to work. That's nothing. Get back to work I said! Do it! You better bring her to the infirmary. You have the nerve to give orders around here. Since when? I give the orders here. Now get to work! You're through giving orders, I tell you. She's right. I'm not mad at you. Look, why don't we forget this, huh? You won't, for certain.You listen. We're not taking your shit anymore. You're gonna get what you deserve. You used to be one us, you traitor. Let go of me. Let's get her down. Have some water. Hurry. Drink it. Get her down. You haven't had enough. That's strange. What could that be? Whatever it is, it's not going to be very pretty. Someone's gotten themselves in some kind of a mess. Maybe a prisoner's gonna get a lesson in manners. Yeah. But do you think she's gonna live through it? Well, we're about to find out. She's drowned. In water two feet high? No, this girl was murdered. Merica was one of my best guards. While on duty, she was attacked and brutally killed. Whoever it was who committed this crime better own up to it, because if they don't, every one of you prisoners will be whiplashed every day, until Merica's murderer has been brought to me. All right, Cesare, start lashing! - Harder! - Walk in a circle! Keep it on line. Who murdered Merica? I want names! More! I want names, now! Come on, move it! Give me a name. Who murdered Merica? Give me a name! Who did it? Harder! Hit them harder! More! I want names now! I'll take this one. You sadistic bastard! No. No. Paco! Leave him to me. He's my responsibility. You fool! Now he's yours. Put this soldier under the ground! Grab him! You'll regret this. Let me go! Yeah, we'll let you go. You'll wish you were dead. I want that manmade an example of. I want to be sure he is very sorry. I'll have him shot. Put him down in the hole where he belongs. Let's go. So much for Laredo's plans. So long, Paco. I had to do that to Paco. I had no choice. We can't be too careful. I thought he was going to spoil everything. I gotta get him out as soon as I can. He'll die if he stays in there much longer. The time is right for the revolt. We must go and inform the others to be ready. Paco'll live through it. What I'm worried about is whether you will. A man's got fortune in gems waiting for him and he won't goin and take it. Is that right? Pablo, I'm here to relieve you. Good, I need some sleep. Everything okay? Yeah, I left a blanket for you in case it gets cold. Great. Thanks a lot. Ruiz, take care of the tower guard. It's all clear. Go on. That's one down. Let's get outta here. Move. Ruiz, let's go. Hey, what was that? What? Did you hear something? Listen. No. Why, did you? Yeah. Hey, did you see anything move? Uh-huh. Listen, man, I could swear I... Hey, boys, look what I got here! Thanks. Go ahead. Drink up. There's plenty for everybody. Don't you worry, there's plenty. Give me that. Ruiz, come on. I don't think anybody heard us. Paco. Paco, are you all right? I'm okay, just get me out of this hole. Not now, Paco. It's not time yet. I'll get you out as soon as I can, I promise. We gotta plant some dynamite first, though. Don't leave me here. To get this lock open. I'll have to shoot it off with a gun. That'll wake the whole place. Be patient. I'll see you later. You two did all right, huh? You bet, amigo. Do we have to wait much longer before we start this fiesta? When the sun comes up there'll be plenty of excitement. And a bunch of emeralds. Uh-huh. You bet ya. Wait. Go. Looks clear. Hurry. Hurry. Somebody's coming this way. Ruiz, hurry. It's not the right moment. Maria, did you hear that? What was that? An explosion? We've gotta get out. Guards, hurry! Barracks A! Hurry up! Quick! Quick, the prisoners are escaping! Paco, cover your ears. Here. Come on. Hurry up! What's going on? The prisoners are attempting an escape. It's a revolt. Shit! Maria, I've got a job for you. Get to Ruiz. He'll tell you what to do. Give him this match and cigar. Hurry! Muriel, come with me. Here, light this dynamite and throw it at these sons of bitches while I climb this tower. You gotta keep me covered, understand? Uh-huh. Go on. Where you going, sweetheart? Rushing off to meet your boyfriend, are ya? Sure. With this dynamite. You're terrific. Let's blow this place up. I'm proud of ya. Now, go use that stuff where it'll do some good. Okay, let's go. Frieda and Norma go left. Muriel, Maria, Tomas, right. What gives you such courage, Muriel? Freedom. Hurry. Maria, be careful with the gems. It's lit. Let's go. Quickly. I'll take those emeralds. They're mine. Cesare! You cunt! Laredo, jackpot! We've got the jewels! The jewels, partner. Two bags of emeralds. Two bags! They're mine. They belong to all of us. That's our agreement. What do you mean, all of us? They're mine. I found 'em. Nobody else worked for 'em like I did. I'm the one who deserves them. You wouldn't try to cheat me out of them, would ya? Not after all I've done. No tricks, Orinoko. Let's have it. Attaboy. It's not fair. They're mine. They're mine. Now, you don't understand... Remember, Orinoko, you agreed to go all the way. Well, I'm sure we can negotiate. I mean, we can work something out. It's, it's not... You agreed to escort us back to the river and carry us home in your boat, remember? Well, well, yeah. But I mean, I'm not going to do it for nothing. I mean, you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours, and... You're great. A man of honor. A gentleman. I knew it. A man after, after my own heart. You're wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. That greedy bastard Orinoko took his cut and disappeared. I guess he knew he had a fighting chance that way. So, Laredo, who could barely even read a compass, led the survivors off through the jungle. The jungle was crawling with patrols. Laredo hoped he could avoid them by cutting through the swamps. They'll have another patrol after us in no time. But we're ahead of them. Don't slow down back there! The river's about 10 miles from here. There's an old hermit there with a boat. I think he'll help us. Let's hope he's still there. All right, let's stop here and rest for a minute. I think we'll be safe. Hey, Laredo, over here. it's cooler. Watch out for snakes. And hopefully no one can see us. Be careful. Here, give me your arm. Okay. Come on, quickly! We have to hurry. Come on! Keep moving! Goddamn wound! I think he's picked up the scent. Come on. Come on. There! Yeah, he smells them all right. They can't be far. Yeah, we're on the right road now. They're gonna wish they'd never been born. Come on! That's it. Careful. That's a girl. They caught up with us! Drop everything and run! Come on, move, move! Be careful here. It's dangerous. Watch where you put your feet. Come on, come on, keep moving. Look out for these branches over here. Stay to the right. Laredo, come quick! What is it? What happened? Get out of the way! I'm afraid we've lost her. I know you're tired, but we've gotta keep going. Ah! Leeches! Maria, I'll take them off. There, there. There. It's all right. Good God! Leeches! Here. We've gotta get them off. No! What have you done? I had to do it. She would have died a worse death. Let's go. We've got to keep moving. Be careful. Slowly. Okay, straight ahead. Help her, Laredo! Here, hold onto this. Help me with this branch. Come on! Grab on to this. Come on, take it, take it. Hold on tight. That's a girl. Come on, hold on! Hold on! Hold on tight! Jesus, they've found us. Get back! Get back! Oh, Kate! Janie! Get over there! Girls, you go ahead. You can be at the river in just a few minutes. I'll keep shooting it out. I'm going to kill those bastards! Laredo, don't be a fool! All right. We'll make run for it. I'll cover you. Now, run! Go on, run! Move! Get outta here! Run! Move, move! Oh, Laredo! Oh, Laredo. Please, please speak to me. Go. Take the emeralds. Escape. Not without you. He's dying. Don't die, please! We'll have to go alone. No! We can't. We can't leave him here to die. We must take him with us. He saved our lives. All right, come on. Let's go. All of that horror, for two little bags of green shit! That got lost in the quick sand anyway. And you know what I realized? Stealing from you isn't enough. Ruining your little empire isn't enough. And killing you probably wouldn't be that big a thrill either. Hey! What is it? Open the safe! Now! Anything you want. You can have everything. Just please don't hurt me. Faster! Quit your blubbering! Faster! It's all yours. I... I can give you a carrying case. Hurry up!
