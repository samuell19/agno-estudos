You heard his name same as I did that night Don't even try to tell me you haven't thought of that name every single day since And what if I did? Do you know he visited me right before I was sent to juvie? Didn't think I knew who he was but I did Mother Fucker Raffaello! He thinks he is a big shot international guy, big boss, LA to Spain thinks he is untouchable yeah Raffaello he thinks he is bullet proof Got all this cops in his pocket Bastard! Nobody even looks in his direction Nobody mentions his name accept for the cartels he's the big, biggest of the big Killed our parents, Klled your father because he was standing in his way in LA and killed my padre because he was standing' in his way in Spain Raffaello is mine Fuck, he is mine I never forget Raffaello even bought my parents' villa He lives in the very same place he had them killed Probably he got a discount, on account of all the blood stains We need a blaster My uncle Indio My uncle he is a bad ass mother fucker!

Listen' I've done a lot of bad things in my life I guess you could've called me a hitman People nickcnamed me Indio the Aztec because I was so vicious And the police officer know it too They could never pin anything on me so they framed me for murder Rat bastards I was in my cell for a long time, sitting on deathrow thinking this is it This is what my story of my life ends To pass the time, I would think about what I'd do if I could do it all over again The idea of a famous LA taceria hit me like a bolt of lightning People go mad on deathrow People go mad in solitary My imaginary taceria kept me from going insane A week before my execution, one of those Innocence programs re-examined the DNA found at the murder scene and find out it wasn't mine and there was the State's case That's incredible No, my little daughter that's redemption God saw my dream and he knew he wanna give me a pass Indio me and Pistolera we got something going on We wanna know if you wanna be part of it? What? We're plannin' on hitting Raffaello Little daughter Revenge is a dark path The further you go, the darker you get You think I haven't thought about settling the score with Raffaello for what he did to my sister to Antonio to your parents Why didn't you? What good would it do mijita? Wouldn't bring 'em back Lissen' to me, I dropped a lot of bodies in my time I deserved to be on deathrow But since God smiled on me I don't wanna put frauds on people's faces anymore I wanna put smiles and keep on there and not wipe them off Taco business that good I got every kind of taco in here known in mankind Even tofu taco Oh man that's too much I hate that fucking vegan they drive me nuts The people trying to gentrify the neighborhood they love come down here getting a taco... or two or a dozen I'm happy for you, tio. I truly am Salut To tofu Hey Come down, come down Give me a cigarette Hi, Cherry You gotta stop being so jumpy Gonna get high blood pressure or something Or something. You, what the fuck is this? You didn't say nuttin' 'bout meetin' nobody else I don't meet with nobody I don't know. I told you that, Pistolera Come down Who is this bitch Relax already, Cherry Dis is my cousin Rico Now you know him Rico... this is Cherry What kinda name is Rico? What kind of name is Cherry? My crack whore mom named me Terese I liked Cherry better Doesn't look like the apple falls far from the tree you got a characteristic I ain't no crackhead Oxy's my thing. And I got it under control I see Speakin' of which... you got my money? Depends On what? Depends? You got my intel? Got it. Is it all there? It's all there baby, come down baby, come down Alright Your info any good? Yeah He's got a shipment going down Who is he? Who is he? You know who he is? You know? Yes I jus' wanna to hear it. Fine It 's Raffaello Reason he's never been busted in all the years he's been operating, is because of one simple rule he has The money and the drugs are never in the same place at the same time What do you mean? A representative receives the money on one end A representative hands off the drugs somewhere else in Spain Smart Of course it is How does he know someone wouldn't burn him on one end or the other? Cause he's Raffaello, duh Only know one guy what double-crossed him And what happened to that guy became a near mythic cautionary tale for all the rest of us So who is that guy? This guy Jerry was his rep on one end to collect the money A high end lawyer, condo on the beach and all that Only, what Raffaello didn't know was that Jerry had a gambling problem and debts he couldn't pay So Jerry has one of his knucklehead buddies guy named Kev rob him How the fuck would he know that? He didn't. Not at first But Jerry, greedy bastard that he was, double- crossed his buddy Gave Kev a third when he had promised him half So lemme guess, Kev ratted out Jerry to Raffaello looking for a reward Yeah, he weren't no Einstein So, not only does Kev not get a reward but Raffaello makes an example out of him Tortures the poor bastard all to hell... then kills him But it's what Raffaello does with the pieces of Kev that makes this story so interesting Which is? As you may have guessed, Jerry is in the wind at this point He took the money and vanished, hiding out in the most remote regions of the four corners of the earth he could find But everywhere Jerry went, Costa Rica, Portugal, Iceland, even Vietnam at one point pieces of Kev would show up Whadaya mean pieces of Kev? Everywhere this schmuck Jerry went, a package showed up on his doorstep Each package had a piece of Kev in it An ear, an eyeball, a testicle, a finger Shit! I know Finally, when Jerry had hid in every single place he could even imagine hiding only to find a package on his doorstep, Jerry gave up He moved back to his condo in Barcelona Why the fuck would he do that? The knowledge that no matter where he went, Raffaello would find him combined with the thought of what Raffaello would do to him if he did that to poor ole' Kev, made Jerry give up The anticipation of what Raffaello was going to do to him was more than Jerry could take So what finally happened? Jerry was home for two weeks and not a single package came. But, by that point Jerry was a mental, emotional and physical wreck He jus' wanted Raffaello to kill him and for it to be over That what happened? One night Raffaello showed up alone at Jerry's with a fine bottle of brandy They drank and relived all the good times they had before Jerry stole from him Then Raffaello left He left? He left, but the next day cops showed up and arrested Jerry for possession of drugs with intent to sell Seems Raffaello had a large quantity of drugs planted in Jerry's house Raffaello used his influence to get Jerry sent to a prison where Raffaello's boys there make Jerry's life a living hell Everything from rape to some real medieval sadistic shit And Jerry tries to commit suicide But Raffaello's boys are always watching and they always saved him all so they can torture the poor bastard for the rest of his life He's still alive? Yeah he is still alive This Raffaello really holds a grudge So, who's Raffaello's new guy? Big time bail bondsman. Dante Troy. Got billboards up Yeah, I've seen his signs every where Now give me my money And remember, you never talked to me ok? Never! Yeah maybe on a date Fucking crazy bitch Can you trust the lil' junkie? Trust the junkie, how the fuck do you trust the junkie? Have you ever met somebody to trust a fucking, If she is a fucking snitch on him, she is gonna be a fucking snitch on us Why you don't listen to your cousin? You fucking listen to me sometime Loca man Felix da cat. Never gets old Dante Don't worry its all there Oh I'm not worried as a Matter-of-fact. Worrying's for suckers Wooh... wait... What kinda half-assed desperados are you? Do know whose money that is? Yeah. Ours Your security's is not so secure ist it? But It doesn't have to be. Only a maniac would steal from... Raffaello. We know who it used to belong to Yeah It belongs to us now Now all we need to know is who deals for Raffaello on the other end? Fuck you! He'd cut my heart out and feed it to me He ain't here Yeah. We are Tell us Sure. Sure Info won't help you anyway His name is Henry Gallardo I know of him, high level lowlife Didn't know he was connected to Raffaello Can I go now? Sure. Sure he can go I didn't see yer faces Oh darlin, the bandannas were just for effect Saw it in a movie once We want you to see our faces You didn't fucking have to do that Fucking piss of shit! Look at you now Spent it fast You are not going to enjoy the fruits of your labor for very long I know. But I hate bail bondsmen You are a lower... praying on poor people when their hurt I'm just a businessman Yeah the same business for us This is personal Fucking hate bail bondsmen They are the worst on fucking earth They should all die Hey that's get the fuck out of here! Go Can you drive that fucking boat Fuck No God time to learn it! Go! Let's go Drive Quick, quick! Let's put the money in here. We gonna get in Let's go You wear white socks? As long the money is dry and as long my cigar is dry I'm alright Raffaello When he finds out what about Dante, he is gonna know someone's on his ass Fucking right. Raffaello can lose sleep for once I'd love to see Raffaello's face when they tell 'em he was ripped off Dis is a lot of money in here But he is not gonna give a fuck He's filthy rich Fucking right Your cigar sir Thank you Esther A man and a woman Throat and the stomach No this was more than just the money! It's personal Personal? They didn't have to shoot Dante. He was unarmed This was to get my attention This was to sent a message to me This was a revenge Against you? No against Vladimir Putin. Of course agains me you dumb fuck I want you to dig into all our men Find out if there is another white bread piece of shit still troubles against Jerry Van Buren Someone who wants to take me out hates me so much they are willing to die in the bargain This is a very dangerous puto madre The old stomping ground Flamenco Show So how we want to get jobs here? We've got money. I don't understand Yeah? And as soon as we start flashin' it, Raffaello's people will be all over us As it is, they'll be on to us soon enough anyway What's the deal with this place? Raffaello's son owns it You didn't tell me Raffaello had a son. Why didn't tell me before? It's not the type of place you could just apply without references But... I have an idea Better be good Keep an eye out for a pudgy guy Rodrigo was a chunky lil' kid with a sweet tooth Who's the hunk at the bar? That's Rodrigo That's Rodrigo? It's like he joined the gym A couple of dark beers Coming right now Thank you. - You're welcome. So that's Raffaello son, sure? Remember when I said he visited me right before I was sent up to juvie He had his son with him Wasn't worried 'bout being' seen with him around me I was a little kid, a nobody he had orphaned who was getting ready to go in the system for the next six years He was so arrogant Never came out and said he did my parents But the gleam in his eyes said it all Sumbitch' what he did to kids to our parents wanna fucken and through it out Probably he figured it was best if no one knew he had a kid Took me a while to track him, he has a different last name and all But it's true. He's Raffaello's son He owns dis place laundering money from his daddy's criminal enterprises. Any job for me? What can you do? Sing and dance Lady do you have any Flamenco clothe for me in the back?
