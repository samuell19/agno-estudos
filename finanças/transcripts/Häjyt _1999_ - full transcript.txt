Get on the ground! Get the fuck down! Heikki, I've been worried about you. You've seemed so different lately. - Life gets me down. I can't stay with you if you won't talk to me. There's no one else if that's what you're thinking. - I know that. Promise me that if you start hating me, you'll go. Don't spoil your life. A small town gypsy isn't offered many options. They all thought I'd be a crook, too. Not coming from farming stock. - You wouldn't though, would you. If someone lost something at school, they always suspected me. The headmaster wanted me to quit but friends helped me stick it out. What were their names? - Antti and Jussi. I was like their kid brother. Sort of a side-kick. What kind of things did you do together? - Pretty bad. A bank job was the worst. One of the customers was paralysed. But you weren't caught? Who did the shooting? The President. Urho Kekkonen. But there's worse than that. I met these guys again five years ago. They were fresh out of jail and I'd just made police chief in our home town... Directed by Aleksi M?kel? THE TOUGH ONES Stop the car! You still got the guts for it? Let's go pay someone a visit. Are you sure that he's the guy? I've gone over it a thousand times. If it's not God, it's gotta be him. Let's go and say hi. - I'll wait here. Good afternoon. How about some coffee? Nice new barn. We came for the money. - What money? We spent five years inside because of that money. It's ours. What money? - We stashed it under a boulder. You were the only one who saw us do it. So you must have liberated it. - That's goddam lie! How does a poor man get to build a cow palace like you've got out there? I won the lottery. - The lottery! I've given you a lot of thought over the years, old timer. I'd really like to kill you. But it's not worth it any more. I should've done it at the time. I should get back to work. - I'll put a hole in you if you try. I did see you burying something under that rock. I guessed what it was when I read the newspapers. But, honestly, I... The fuck with your lies. You're supposed to be a Christian. What's that smell? - Your stinking lies, you thief. A fine barn. I'm going to report you to the police. - Why? It was an accident. What do you mean? - You'll tell the police it was an accident. To keep us in a cheerful frame of mind. You'll keep your balls only as long as we stay cheerful. Now I finally feel like I'm free. Drop me home. Your house went under the hammer. The bank owns it now. Where's my brother? - He drank himself into a clinic three years back. No wonder he hasn't written much. - You can stay with us. Sisko's room is free. She married some wimp. Lives in a fancy house down in the town. You can sleep in her room, which is what you always wanted anyway. Hey kid! How's things? - You don't have to shout anymore. We sold some forest and bought the best hearing aid available. What are you going to do now? - I'm not going back inside, that's for sure. Haven't thought of anything? - No. Haven't had the time, right? Been so busy in jail? You don't think about anything in there. You're just so fucking pissed off. Why don't you get married, get decent jobs? Son! If only life was that simple. That would be OK with me. I just don't think I'm up to it. We could get into bootlegging like your grandpa. Real jobs mean taxes. We'd never pay off those damages. Is bootlegging such hot business? - No, but the taxman doesn't take a cut. Until we get caught. You won't be. A bootlegger is everyone's friend. A weekly bottle to the police chief is all it takes. No one can drink that shit. - Same stuff you were weaned on. And your dad. We'll get Swedish spirit from One-Eye and sell that. Does he give credit? - Not to us. Things are pretty strange these days. Lots of lives lost in knife fights. Young fellas don't know how to slash any more. They use their knives like pokers. Young girls drink like fish and grown-up men eat salad. Fucking hell! - I don't brew it for its flavour. Watch out! Fuck it! This hero is wanted at the station. A barn has been burned down. What does the owner say? - He says it was an accident. Well, then. It can't be an accident. The owner is a very careful man. Wise, too. If someone torched the barn on purpose - the insurance company would be off the hook. Unless the man with the match also had money to burn. Who says he hasn't? - How the hell should we know? Like the owner says, it's best to let it be. OK. An accident it is. Again. Besides, it's none of my business any longer. I'm just about to retire anyway. You've been a fine chief... if a bit keen from time to time. Since when do customers have to pay in advance? - Company policy. Does policy apply to anyone besides gypsies? - Gypsies and blacks. Hello. Hello? Hi there. How are you? Who is it? - No one. So. What's up? Got myself educated and married and now my life's a fucking mess. Same here. Minus the education and the marriage. They were insane to let you out. You overgrown juvenile delinquents don't even make the grade as dog food. They should've locked at least one of you inside for good. They did try. Go back where you came from. Is that all you have to say after five years? It's the truth. No one has missed you here. Go hang yourselves before more innocent people have to suffer. Antti! You're free. Why didn't you let me know? I only got out yesterday, - I've waited for you. That was a crazy thing to do. You should've found someone else. There is no one else. Only Jesus and you. There's a lot of work to be done here. The locals either find God or murder each other. Maybe they just need a push in the right direction. I'm the first police chief to retire without having killed anyone. Good that one of you young rascals has done something worthwhile with your life. It gives me back my faith in being a policeman. Are Antti and Jussi home? - No need to shout. Hello. - They're not here right now. Don't you say hello to visitors round here? I'll be damned! Heikki! Well, fuck me dead! What's with the police car? - I've made acting police chief here. Seriously, I have! Tonight we'll get shit-faced and round up all the old bunch. You too. Too much paperwork. I can't make it. - No shit! .. bitter and cold, the axe just fell. The family's leaving, how can you tell? Songs of pity, songs of sorrow. It's time to steal, it's time to borrow. A land of lakes, a land of wood. A desperate people did the best they could. Locked in our faces, heaven's gate. No time to love, just time to hate. No aces left, time's running out... I can't believe you're a policeman. - It's just a summer job. I'm the one who should've had the hot shot schooling. You still have time. I'll be dead in ten years, flat broke and hated. Shit! Didn't remember it tasted this bad. - Yet I haven't changed. The asshole wouldn't have found the money if we'd hidden it here. But we got even. Took care of things on your behalf, too. How are you going to live? No idea but I'm not going back to jail. We'll start by shooting the law. - Watch it. The gun's loaded. Well, you can't kill anyone if it isn't, can you. This soft bastard went to fancy schools while we were doin' time. Is that fair, Heikki? No. You could have ended up just like us. - Heikki would never have talked. No, I wouldn't. The right barrel was empty. Let's check out the left one. Just kidding. Don't look so grim. - Put it down. Looks like the left one was loaded though... The whole town would have heard that. Just the chief having some target practice. Give me that gun. Why? - I'm confiscating it. Or do you have a licence for it? You know I don't. Hell, you're the one who stole it in the first place. That was then. Now I'm on the side of the law. What do you think Heikki's up to? - Nothing. He always used to drink with us. He's up to something. - No, he ain't. He'd have been better off staying in Helsinki. - He's OK. Lighten up, asshole. Soon we'll have the old gang back together. Seen Jyri around? - Blew himself up. Dynamite. How about Shithead Jack? - Drowned in the lake. Eero Kivim?ki? - Well buried. Are you going to buy something or not? How about putting a couple of sausages on my tab? - You owe me money already. What's the favourite local method of foreplay? The man tells the woman to get herself damp while he goes take a dump! You've told that me that one before. A beer and a brandy. That'll be forty-two marks each. Eighty-four marks altogether. Bring us another shot. Pay for these first. - Later. When it's more convenient. You can only run a tab if you are eating. - OK, then we'll eat. You can't eat at this table. - In that case we'll switch tables. All dining places are reserved. Who's getting that fancy dinner? What's a retirement banquet for the old chief of police. Of course. We've been invited to that! What the hell! Get out of here! We're celebrating the police chief's retirement. Without us, the town's whole police force could retire! We don't tolerate ex-cons round here. You ought to be back in jail. - Being taught some manners. Olavi Miettinen. Mayor. - Heikki Gronberg. Acting chief of police. Stig Nenonen. Chairman of the Lions Club. - Please, have a seat. What seems to be the problem? You have a couple of criminals under arrest. - Dangerous types. I did have. They've been released. Released? - Yes. They attacked some decent citizens yesterday. We're pressing charges for assault and battery. We've been told that they've also burnt down a barn. That's interesting. Two men suddenly attack a bunch of eight. We're talking two big men. - Take it easy now. This is how I see it. Correct me if I'm mistaken. You tried to beat these guys up but took a thrashing yourselves. This town is their home and they have a right to return here. Leave them alone. Aren't you the gypsy punk that used to hang around with them. - That's right. I have influential friends in the police force. People who can affect your career. Between us, this is little more than a hobby for me I'll be starting my real career in banking in the fall - in the capital. If you don't get yourself debarred first. Until next time. Every new police chief throws his weight around to start with. They want to show who's boss by arresting people for unsolved old crimes. He'll learn the ropes in time. He was already stubborn as a kid. Honest work has never paid off, boys. And never will. I don't want to go back to the slammer. - God bless you all. What do you want? - Antti. God wants you to get a job. Did he tell you that? The next time you have a chat with him - ask him why he made me so thick that I can't even find one. I'll get a job for you. - What about Jussi? Him as well. I thought you boys would be a bit younger. - Daddy, please. How much is the pay? - Twenty-five marks per hour, paid at the end of each day. Let's get the hell out of here. Jussi! - What? You're not going for a drink already? At this hour? None of your fucking business. Don't you realize the mess you're in? Get a job. Pull yourself together. - What do you care? I don't. - Shut up then. But I do care. A hell of a lot. I once thought I could marry you but you didn't want me. Son of a bitch! I did want you. The occasion just never came up. I care about you. I don't believe you. - I do. If you care so much, why don't you gimme a piece of ass! Here's some ass for you! Why the fuck are you whining now when it's all over! If you had been a man back then, you'd have gotten yourself some ass. And you - not a word. Where are you going? - To take a leak. That's the third time today. What do you do in there? I'll hold it in then. Sure I can run a tab. - Social security is over the road. The chair is another three hundred. Two schnitzels. Hold the herring. The shopkeeper called. What did he want? - Give me the wallet. What wallet? - Give it to me. Don't be a fool. What are you then? The chief of police? The cops are making bets that you'll be back inside within two months. Is that what you want? Give me the money and the wallet and you can keep your job. Where's your mate? - Fucking the neighbour's goat for all I care. You witless shit-for-brains! Now we're really fucked! It's five past. - I don't have a watch. I only hired you because Paula insisted. Are you ashamed of me because you think I'm cracked? I'm ashamed of myself. - Then we're made for each other. If you're not ashamed of me. take me to the dance. No way. Back to jail, right? - We're just warming up. You get out of here. Let him come in. The men in this family have to stick together. But no moonshine for you until you've grown some hair down there. I have already. - Baby down. - This is not a bright idea. We have to sell these. We'll end up dead if we drink the lot by ourselves. Okay. But only this batch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The next generation's taking over? - Why not? We could take a couple of bottles. - I'll take one, too. You'll get the money as soon as I get my pension. I'm not coming this time. You sinners, take your poison back to Hell's darkness whence you came. No spirits will cross my threshold. Be gone, before the Lord striketh you down! Dear Lord, wreak vengeance on these bootleggers with your holy fire. Slip me a bottle after all. I'll drink it when she's gone to bed. Getting late? - Close call. Fucking stop laughing. There is a good man going down the drain. - For nothing. Go and put some sense into his head. By Christmas we'll be able to pay the damages. Then we'll be really free. We're free already. - Take a look at yourself. If you have money, you're free. If you're broke, you're always a prisoner. I'll do anything. But I won't go back to jail. You'll work your ass off and still not be able to pay even the interest owed. Out of my way. - If we deal with One-Eye, we'll make 500 percent. You're disturbing the customers. The beer is five marks. Who's paying? Oh dear. The plants look a bit dry. Happy birthday. - We said; happy birthday. My birthday is in January. - We've heated the sauna for you. I don't have the time for that. I've got a lot of paperwork to do. Where did this come from? - What's that to you? I lent you the money so that you could keep your job. - I quit. What do you mean you quit? - You can't stamp out crime in this town. Spare yourself the agro. Stick to issuing driving licences to kids. Dear Jesus, please give me the strength to resist this temptation. What do you want from me? Take me to the dance... or there'll be no more of... ...or not after this, anyway. I guess Jesus didn't give me enough strength this time round. I've gotta go. People say that you've been with Jussi. And my husband thinks so too. But I haven't. You ought to watch out. - I thought you hated my husband. Loathe the fella; but make sure you know what you're doing. I'm going to the dance on Friday. Can I have a bottle? No. Aren't you a bit young for that? - I'm one of the oldest guys there. It's pussy that he's after. The local girls won't give him any. - Maybe some out-of-towners will. Who's this playing at amateur cop? One-Eye, give me your belt so we can finish this rat off. Let him go. What happened the last time we left witnesses alive? - He's my brother-in-law. You won't rat on your family, will you? - No, I won't. I don't trust this slime bag. How can I face my sister if you kill her husband? Tell me. It's your call - and you can live with it. Go on home. Don't you ever stand up for yourself? You're an embarrassment. I've got the evidence that'll send those guys back to jail. Sorry. I came too fast. No. You came five years too late. Leave him. I'll leave him when you get a hold on yourself. The lowlifes are selling moonshine. And that's your biggest problem right now? It should be your problem. You should worry more about what your wife's up to with one of them. That sort of misconduct is outside the jurisdiction of the law. I could see these better if they were printed. I was thinking the police... -... would pay for it? Yes. And if nothing is done this time, I'll file a complaint against you. Hello. The usual? - The wife's getting suspicious. Maybe next week. You're on a mission from God, boys! I'll take the liquor, if you can give me a line of credit. Got any money? We need to get some gas. All the cash is tied up with the booze. We haven't sold enough lately. We should get some new customers. You guys want booze? Grandpa told us not to sell to the kids. - He's not calling all the shots. You're not allowed to bring your own drinks into the bar. We're not here to drink. - We came here to do business. All brands. Full service. Take your choice and the prices are competitive. I don't know. As a bonus, you get insurance. - What sort of insurance? Fire insurance. Minimises the risk of the restaurant burning down. How are you doing? - Just fine. Tell me what are you up to these days? - Eating and farting, mainly. And that's all? - Spit out what you came here to say. Are you selling illegal alcohol? No. What the hell am I going to do with you? - Shut up and mind your own business. It's not only up to me. Don't you apes know what's good for you? Who took these pictures? Your brother-in-law. They'll have to go to police HQ if you don't quit. This is the last time. Promise? - We're not promising anything. Especially now that you don't have any evidence. The boys will still be selling moonshine long after you're dead and gone. What the hell? Come out. Let's settle this now once and for all. Let me show how it feels to get an axe up your ass. I've called the police. What's going on here? I came to kill your husband. - If anyone kills him, it'll be me. When I told you to get your shit together, this is not exactly what I meant. Just get the hell out of here. You'll pay for that mirror. - You just shut up. It costs at least a thousand! A thousand each! The film was ruined. Nothing came out at all. Jussi Murikka tried to kill me with an axe. I called the police but no one answered. Manpower deficit. Most unfortunate. They're using you. And you're protecting them. Is that so? - I've contacted your superior. He has already started an investigation. - Call whoever you like. You studied hard in law school for years and now you're throwing it all away. For those two. I don't understand. That doesn't surprise me at all. Your ex-buddies have turned you into a lap-dog. Heel, doggie, heel. Hello. Oh dear. So it's that kind of operation. I'll be over right away. Oh dear. What a shame. Don't use unnecessary force. Arrest the suspects and confiscate all possible evidence. Nothing more. Where have you been? The moped's acting up. - Sure. Where are the boys? - I'll whisper it to you. Did you check every possible place? - Absolutely. Fuck it. God will punish you for betraying your friends. Wake up, old man. Start living in this century. Your ancient ways are finished. You think it's safe to go back? - I think so. God damn it! How's things? Does it hurt bad? - I'll die if I don't get some moonshine. Push! Remember this: if someone does you wrong, get even. Never go anywhere without a knife - not even to take a crap. Your father was a good man but me and my pa - we weren't. Don't you become one. Grandpa! Don't you fucking die! Wake up, grandpa. Fuck it, wake up. Listen, he needs proper rest. No, you listen, you weasel. For your own safety, he'd better recover fast. A shot of vodka. Interesting. Chief inspector Tornqvist from police HQ. - Heikki Gronberg. Acting chief of police. I came to check things out round here. Everything is OK. The local liquor store has informed us that spirit sales are way down. It's the European Union: more wine is being drunk. Thirty years in the force has taught me a thing or two. One of them being: never let a gypsy indoors without handcuffs. This time I'll make an exception. You may leave now. But this is my office. - So you think I should be the one to go? I'm your boss until I've cleared things up. And that won't be long. Get the fuck out of here. - Hello to you, too. You promised to stay out of our way. - I've changed my mind. Rock-a-bye, baby. - Quiet. Are you going to kill him? I'd like to. - Well, if you must. But do it outside. For fuck's sake! Can't I even watch TV in peace? You're getting soft and it's pissing me off. The farmer, your brother-in-law and this asshole. Let him say what he came here to say. Tornqvist took over my duties. No one in this town has the guts to sell us out. We'll cough up the damages by Christmas. What are you going to say when they ask you where the money came from? A friend of mine works in a shipping company. I'll get you passports and see that you get out of the country. I'll pick you up in the morning. It's a trap. - Why would he want to trap us? He's been nothing but a shitload of trouble so far. - Leave him out! We were friends once. This'll settle up the score and get you out of my hair for good. Deal? Come on! Don't leave the house and don't kill anybody. Can one of you take me to the dance? No way we'll sell to you. You can have it for free. My brother's not home yet. - Maybe he's getting laid. Why the hell didn't we think of this sooner? Grandpa wouldn't have let us sell to kids. They have learn how to drink, too. Let's go. - Do you think the kid's going to be OK? He'll be just fine, He's a big guy. He drinks, has women - the works. You're late. Little Brother. I'm getting out of here. We might not meet again. Stay out of trouble. Antti. Hey! You missed the turn. A drunken youth killed five others when his car crashed into a crowd. Three more were injured. They were all pissed out of their brains. Kids as young as ten. God blessed Roope Karhu with a gentle, friendly and righteous nature. God delighted our souls with his joyous laughter and smiles. Sometimes it's God who performs His deeds, sometimes it's the Devil. This time it was the Devil. I suggest we pause here to throw these demons out of our church. He is my brother. Am I not allowed to come to the funeral of my own brother? Am I so evil? Take a look at this. Farmer wins the lottery, builds a new barn. Who the hell took the money if not that old farmer? What difference does it make now? - We torched an innocent man's property. No one's innocent. Heikki. Can you help us keep out of jail? - No, I can't. You're a cheating bastard. You are being questioned on suspicion of malfeasance, neglect of duty - document falsification and being an accessory to a crime. Do you understand your situation? You are a complete fool. Spill the beans now and you might just manage to keep yourself out of prison. Fine. We'll continue the interrogation on a daily basis - until we get to the bottom of this. Don't leave town. Would you rather die than pay? - Kill me, I don't have any money. You got your pension money yesterday. That was yesterday. There's no money now. Even if I had some, I wouldn't pay you. We've all decided that no one owes you anything. It's an ungrateful world. If the debtor hasn't paid the whole sum in cash before the due date - the farm will be put up for compulsory auction and sold to the highest bidder. God damn it. - Calm down. I don't want you to die. Nothing will ever kill me. But my home is not for sale. Will anyone bid another five thousand? - Somebody pay this taxi driver. Are you going to pay him? I don't need any help. Go to hell, all of you. We are conducting a legal compulsory auction - here of which you have been properly informed. That may be the law on paper. But our laws here are different! Go home! Five thousand anyone? There's five thousand. There's three-thirty. Going once, twice ... Sold! It's yours. But first you'll have to show me that you deserve it. I bought the farm. He's an old man. Leave him alone. - Call an ambulance! I bought it. Good morning. I think we'd better drive down to the police station. I'll tell them you turned yourselves in. You'll get a lighter sentence. Oh dear. I'm so sorry it had to end like this. Surely there's still room to make some kind of deal? You mean that I could just drive on into work while you pushed off ... No. We have to go to the station. Winter's on its way. It's cold without a roof over your head. Oh dear. I'm sorry, boys. - All this sorry stuff is starting to piss me off. Fuck it! Don't you care about anything? - Chill out. You can't just go round killing people like that. This'll put us away for life. I thought we didn't want to go back to jail! - No, we don't. ''By Christmas we'll pay the damages'' My ass! Who cares about one policeman? If it bothers you so much, chuck him into the woods. We'll bust up a bank, get fake IDs from One-Eye and head for Rio. Cheer up, won't you. They thought I was dying. But I'll never die. - I know. Never. But others will. Why did you have to kill that good man? It was on the radio. A man has the right to do as he pleases, if he can stand behind his deeds. Never kill without good reason. And leave the kids alone. Son. You must stay alive. Your brother is dead. I'm no good for anything anymore. Ten years in jail is not forever. When you get as old as I am, you'll see that a year can feel like a week. I'm not going to live that long. One of us has to stay on here. Do you understand? Let me go. - Do you understand? We have to go. The police are here. - I understand. What is it? - Your friends have apparently split up. Murikka is being chased and will soon be in custody. Where's the other one? OK, if you catch them, dead or alive, I'll help you out. I have no reason to trust you. You gypsies have always sold off a mate if there was something in it for you, right? Look at these. Goodbye. - Where are you going? To trade at the horse fair. You dance well. - Wouldn't that be too much? What? - If an ugly, stupid loser like me couldn't dance either? Time to go. Antti! I'm here. What are you doing here? - I came to take you in. Look me in the eye. I'm going to walk out of that door - and you won't do a damn thing. Do you understand? You don't have the guts to shoot me. - I don't have the guts not to. Hands up! Up, I said! You wanted to come here and despise us. To be better than us, to show us how successful you had become. I tried to help you the best way I could. I tried! Why the fuck would you do that? - I owe it to you. You keep on saying that. You don't owe us anything. That's the way it goes. Some people get caught, others walk away. There's more to it than that. Do you want to know why I owe you? The old farmer didn't take the money. I took it. I had to do what I did. Otherwise I would have ended up like you guys. You've destroyed my life! - You destroyed it yourself. Heikki. Give me the keys. Give me the keys. - No, I won't. Heikki. The keys. I'm scared. Jussi is dead. I can present your case in court. Will you? What's what friends are for. And so, we all lived happily ever after... Translated by: Marie-Louise Karttunen
