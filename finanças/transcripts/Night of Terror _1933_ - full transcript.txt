(triumphant orchestral music) (ominous orchestral music) (uneasy orchestral music) (girl shrieks) - Read all about it, another maniac killing, extra, extra, paper, mister? - This is an outrage, a young boy and girl stabbed to death. Why don't the police catch this man? - But haven't the police any clue? - Yes, he always leaves newspaper clippings pinned on his victim's body. Don't you think it's strange, that? - He kills only after sundown. - Two more tonight, how many has he killed so far? - 12, no one's safe! Who will be the next? - What's the cops got to say? - We'll have this maniac, dead or alive, in 24 hours. You can print that in your newspaper. - [Reporter] What, again? You gave us that same statement three days ago. - [Reporter] Hey Bailey, do you know what he looks like? - He's got the distorted face of a madman, he's about five foot 11-- - [Man] When last seen, he wore a dark suit and a slouch hat. He is believed to be somewhere in the vicinity of the Post Road and the Rinehart Estate. (light orchestral music) (moves to uneasy orchestral music) (footsteps faintly clicking) (moves to harmonious orchestral music) (loud knocking) (moves to suspenseful orchestral music) (insistent knocking) - Still at it, Arthur? - Yes, Uncle. - You know, I haven't seen you since you read your paper before the Academy this morning. - Oh, I intended to come to your room later. - Tell me, my boy, what did the old greybeards say when you made the startling announcement that you plan to allow yourself to be buried alive? - It came as a bombshell. I told them about my discovery for producing a suspension of animation and respiration. I told how, after injection of the fluid, life exists without the need of oxygen. - I can see them bobbing their heads and waving their beards like a lot of old nanny goats. To be able to live without breathing, that's what it is. - Ole Adams challenged it. - Well, of course he would, I can hear him, of what possible benefit to mankind would it be for a person to allow himself to be buried alive? - Exactly, and I reminded them of miners trapped in cave-ins, of sailors who would perish in sunken submarines. But my discovery will prevent these tragedies. - What did they say then? - Oh, they were disappointed because I wouldn't reveal my formula and present it to the Academy. - Reveal it, why should they expect that, when you refuse to tell even your old Uncle Dick? - Oh, please forgive me, Uncle Dick, for not making you a confidant in my experiment. There's always a possibility of failure. I want to spare you the humiliation, should it by some chance fail. - I understand, my boy, but I'd rather you told me. (soft thudding) Did you hear that? Degar! How is it that every time I turn around, I find you snooping about. - But master, I've come to warn you. - To warn me, hmm? - There's cause for alarm, leading paper states that the maniac has committed murder again, this time, close to this very house. (paper rustling) - Has Mary returned home? - No, master. - Did Sika accompany her? - Miss Mary insisted on going alone. - Oh, why is it that you two heathens will persist in allowing that child to have her own way. I've begged, implored, beseeched you not to let her go out of this house alone, but neither one of you paid the slightest attention to me. Let me know the moment she returns. - Yes, master. - What's the matter, Mary, honey? You seem a little quiet tonight, anything wrong? - Oh, nothing in particular. You know, Tom, I read your article in tonight's paper about the maniac, it's enough to give anyone the jitters. - Ah, we've always had those mugs. You know, I read a book not so long ago by Jack the Ripper, you know, the maniac that terrorized London? - Must you keep on talking about that? - I'll talk about anything I wanna. Oh, your eyes are like dewdrops. - (laughs) Don't be silly. - I was gonna tell you have lovely ankles too, but I won't. - Why, the very idea. - The perfect idea. You know, honey, remember that scene in the picture show tonight where the hero leaned over and whispered in his sweetheart's ear and said, "I adore you", then he kissed her? - It's a silly lot of rot. - You think so, huh? Well, I've been getting away with that silly lot of rot ever since Julius Caesar, and I'm one that doesn't think it's a lot of rot. - Oh, I do. - That's because you never had a real moving picture kiss before, here's where you get a break. (motor humming) (lips smack) - Why, why, the idea-- - Your face is flushed, you seem more animated. In fact, your breath's a little short. - Now, you listen to me, Tom Hartley, what you did just now proves to me that you're nothing but a common roughneck newspaperman. I don't understand how I ever became interested in you. - And I can't understand how you came interested in that goofy guy who spends twenty hours a day in a laboratory looking into a 'lectric light bulb. - Don't you dare say such things about Arthur Hornsby, he's a very brilliant man. I want you to know I'm engaged to marry him. - Alright, go ahead, marry him. All your children will be born with double-lens glasses on. - I hate you! - Your eyes are like dewdrops. - You know, Uncle, sometimes I think Mary's restless, unhappy. - Oh, nonsense, my boy, all she needs is a little attention. You know, I'm hoping that someday soon, this whole house will be made gay celebrating your wedding with Mary. - I too look forward to it, Uncle. - You know, my boy, I'm worried. I don't like the idea of your going through with this burial. - I've gone too far to back out now. The Academy is sending down a committee tomorrow to witness the experiment. - Is everything in readiness? - There's the box, waiting for me. I told the gardener to dig the grave tonight, so as not to attract attention. (shovel scraping) (gardener screams in pain) (body thuds) Come on, we'll take a look at it. You see, he's finished. - Yeah. - If I weren't a lady, I'd-- - Yes, I know, you're home now, so you don't have to talk to me anymore. - Thank goodness for that. (Tom laughs) (frogs croaking) - Martin, take Mr. Hartley back to the newspaper office. - Don't bother, Martin, I'll walk. - Walk? - Yeah, this is the one time the man's gonna walk back. - Oh, Tom, please don't walk back. It's dangerous with that maniac at large. - The way you've made me feel, I'd like to meet that maniac right now. Martin, what would you do if you met the maniac? - If I was to meet that there maniac, I would become famous. I would become the first man to fly without wings. (Tom and Martin laughing) - Honey, I still think your eyes are like dewdrops. I'll be seein' ya. Martin, you meet that maniac, give him my regards. - Hmm? (car door thuds) (Martin exclaims in fright) (water gurgling) (faint whirring) - Good evening, Degar. - And good evening, Miss Mary. - Where's my father? - He's in the laboratory. - Thank you. - But, Miss, may I speak? - Of course, Degar. - I want to warn you of danger, the man who kills is near. Do not leave the house at night, no matter with whom. - Oh, I'm not afraid. - Sika! - Hello, everybody! - Oh, it's Mary. - Oh, Mary, I've been concerned about you all evening. - Oh, I'm sorry, Father. I told Sika I was going to the theater. - I was in hopes you'd stay home and read Adam's Life Among the Fossils, it's most absorbing. - Well, I felt like something a little lighter tonight. You don't object, do you, Arthur. - Of course he doesn't. I know this old house is dull at times, but tomorrow, Arthur will finish his experiment, and then he'd have more time for you. - Yes, the experiment ends tomorrow, with a burial. - And then, your wedding. And a honeymoon in the south of France. Won't that be fine, Arthur? - Oh yes, yes, splendid. - There's no getting away from it. Arthur certainly is a passionate lover. - Oh yes, yes indeed. (liquid gurgling) - Well, I'm going to bed. - Well I guess we're through here for the night, eh, Arthur? - Oh yes, yes, of course. - Mary, I insist that you do not go into town again alone. - Why, Father? - Well, it isn't safe. There've been a lot of murders lately. - Hmm, what's that about murders? - Oh, that's what Degar wanted to show me, but I didn't want to tell you because I thought it might interrupt your work. - Well, personally, I think the papers are exaggerating. - Yeah, I'm not afraid. I'll do just what Martin says he'd do, he said, if I sees that old maniac, I'll become famous, 'cause I'll be the first man to fly without wings. (Richard and Mary laughing) - There you go, get out of here, get out. - Oh, yes, Mary? Uncle, please flip the lock in the door for me. - I'll tend to that, Arthur. (lock clicks) - Thanks. (lock clicks) - Sika. Sika, look at me! I warned you not to go into a trance. What have you seen, what do you know? - Death is very close. - Death is always very close. - [Arthur] Are you angry with me? - [Mary] Of course not, Arthur, why do you ask? - [Arthur] Oh, I've been rather neglectful lately, 'cause I've had a lot on my mind. - [Mary] Oh, I know. I understand. - [Arthur] I thought you would. Now Mary, be sure your windows and doors are barred. - [Mary] Sika does that. - [Arthur] Good night, Mary. - [Mary] Good night, Arthur. - [Arthur] Good night, Uncle. - [Richard] Good night. Mary? Did your ears burn tonight? - No, Father, why? - Well, they should have, because Arthur and I have been talking about you. - Something nice? - What else could it be but nice? (Mary laughs) (lips smacking) - Good night, Father. - [Richard] Good night, dear. - [Mary] Good evening, Sika. - [Sika] And did my little miss have a pleasant evening? - [Mary] Oh, not very, I was bored. - [Sika] You cannot fool Sika. Tonight, I had the feeling that you were very happy. - Don't tell me you've been going into another one of those trances. - [Sika] No, but Sika sees many things. - Tell me, what else did you see? - Trouble, sadness, and death, gathering all about, like clouds over the moon. - Oh, don't, Sika, you made me feel all creepy. - Do not fear, little miss. There is much love and happiness for you. - Sika, do you think my eyes are like dewdrops? - They're very lovely. (Mary giggles) (uneasy orchestral music) - [Richard] What are you doing here? - I heard you walking up and down, master. Thought you might want something. - No, I don't want anything. - Perhaps you'd like the evening paper? - No, there's nothing in the papers. - Nothing but murder. (Richard grunts in disgust) (frogs croaking) - [Sika] Pleasant dreams. - [Mary] Thank you, good night. Sika, aren't you going to your own room? - [Sika] Tonight, Sika stays here. - Oh, no, go to your room. I'll be alright, go on. (frogs croaking) - [Mary] (shrieks) Sika! - [Sika] Tell me, what is it, what happened? - Oh, a terrible face, there at the window! - [Sika] There, there, little one. No harm can come to you while Sika is here. - Oh, Sika, it was terrible. (frogs croaking) (lighthearted orchestral music) (moves to uneasy orchestral music) (moves to lighthearted orchestral music) (Richard cries out) (heavy thudding) (Richard shouts in pain) - [Mary] Sika, Father! (sobs) Arthur! Father, Father! Oh, what's happened to Father? Call a doctor, call a doctor! - It is too late. - He's dead. (Mary whimpers) - There, there, little miss. - Come, let's call the police at once. (bones rattling) (Martin shrieks) - Hello, operator? Operator, get me police headquarters, quick. Hello? (siren wailing) (motor roaring) (tires screeching) - [Bailey] What's the idea? - What's up, Bailey? - Another murder. - Okay, sweetheart, I'm on your side, let's go. (motor rumbling) (siren wailing) (tires screeching) - [Bailey] I've got this thing all figured out, it's the maniac's job, I'll run him down. - [Tom] You never run down anything but your heels. - [Bailey] I know, I see you, I ain't run down, but I'm gonna knock him down. Aw, what's the use, I'm only wastin' my breath. - [Tom] Sure, save it, and when you meet the maniac, you can use it to gas him, where's your phone. - Right there. - Run, ya mug. - Crestview, 0191, yeah. Hello, night desk? Hartley talkin', 'nother maniac murder. Yeah, sure, so where do you think I read it, an almanac? Now get this, Professor Rinehart murdered in his own home. Yes, same clues, newspaper clipping on the body. Yes, that's right, police as baffled as ever, handing out the same bunk. - Now, Mr. Hornsby, you just leave everything to us. I guess you know we get 'em, and we'll get this guy, if I ain't interfered with by this mug newspaper man. (Tom laughs) As long as I'm here, nothing can happen. - Took the words right out of (heavy thudding) my mouth. - [Bailey] What's that? Hey, you, I'll take care of that. (body crashing) (Mary and Sika shrieking) - Two right here in one night. - Only a week since the master's will was read, and already they fight over the money like dogs over a bone. (scoffs) Why should the master have left his brother anything? Cared nothing for him. He never came to see him when he was alive. - Perhaps he will be the first of the heirs to die. - According to the master's will, the rest of us will inherit his share. - [Woman] I think your brother was an old fool. - [Man] Just a minute. After all, he was my brother. - [Woman] That didn't keep him from being a fool. Think of it, including servants in his will. I'm disgusted. - Well, don't be disgusted out loud. (footstep echoes) You don't know who might be listenin'. - [Woman] Thank you. I wouldn't put it past that heathen to poison us. - [Mary] Arthur, please try and keep him off the subject of Father's will. - [Arthur] I'll try. - [Mary] I don't believe I can stand any more of it. - [Arthur] You know, they resent the fact that Uncle left the same amount to Degar and Sika as he did to the rest of us. - Wish Father hadn't left me anything. - [Arthur] You forget, dear, that Uncle loved you very dearly. You meant as much to him as though you were his own daughter. - [Man] Arthur, Sarah and I have just been talking about Degar and Sika. - Oh, please, Uncle John. - [Sarah] This is important, Mary. - [John] We think you should get rid of Degar and Sika at once. - [Sarah] They're not to be trusted. - [Mary] Oh, how can you say a thing like that? They've been in this house for 15 years. - My uncle was very fond of them, I couldn't send them away. - But do you realize that if anything happened to us, if we should mysteriously die, our share would go to these two servants. - How dare you insinuate that Degar or Sika would harm any of us, they're devoted to us. - But my brother wasn't in his right mind. To think, if he established a pension of $100 a month for his colored children. - Oh, Mr. Arthur? - [Arthur] Oh Martin, I want you to meet the eight o'clock train, some gentlemen are arriving to stay overnight. - [Martin] Why, yes, sir. Uh, Mr. Arthur, uh, excuse me, could I ask you (stammering) a question that's been circulating my brain? - [Arthur] Sure, Martin, what is it? - About your uncle's will, he left me $25 a week as long as I live. - That's right, Martin, as long as you live. - As long as I live, that's what makes me feel so nervous. If it's any way that you all can, uh, legally take me out of this will, I will appreciate it. - [Arthur] Oh, I see, you want to be disinherited, huh? - Yes? In a way of speaking. - [Arthur] (laughs) Go on, meet that train. - Oh, yes, sir. - [Arthur] I just sent Martin down to the station to meet the committee from the Academy. - I've never heard of anything quite so mad, Arthur. Being buried alive. I'm sure those authorities will interfere. - [Arthur] That's why I swore you all to secrecy, I can't afford to have any interference. - Well I, for one, will remain in my room until it's all over. - Arthur, I was in hopes of witnessing the demonstration. - Well, that's agreeable to me, Uncle. - Thank you. - [Degar] Dinner is served. (motor rumbling) - After you put the car up, Martin, come in and take care of the door. I'm going to be busy tonight with the master. And remember, no one in this household is receiving callers tonight. - Oh, yes, sir. Just who was those, er, uh, gentlemans? Ain't they look like undertakers? - I advise you not to be too curious. It's always best to keep your mouth and your eyes closed. (Martin whistles softly) - [Arthur] My one regret is that my uncle, Richard Rinehart, is not here to witness the experiment. This research was made possible by his great generosity. It is to his memory that I dedicate my formula, the Reinhardt Discovery. - Your sentiments are very noted. - Young man, do you realize the possibility of disaster in so hazardous an experiment? And have you provided that the Academy be absolved of all blame. - Yes, this paper is prepared in case of my death. It will be in, that should be about 125 degrees Fahrenheit. - Turn around, wait for me right here, will ya, palsy? - Okay, Chief. (urgent knocking) (insistent banging) (Martin exclaims) - Oh, master Tom, I thought you was that dude, what, the maniac man. - [Tom] The hat marks the hat. Don't you worry about that maniac man, he just suddenly disappeared into thin air. - I suppose he just run out of (stammers) people to kill, and naturally, he had to kill himself. - (laughs) Martin, what a detective you'd make. Listen, Miss Mary in? - Mm-mm. - Don't lie, uh-uh, come on, come on, no more gin. - Well, she told me to tell you that she ain't at home. - Well, I'm telling you to tell her that Mrs. Harper's little boy Tom is down here to see her, she'll see me, alright, go on, go on, go on, go on. - [Tom] Hiya, honey! - [Mary] Oh, Tom, I was just going to bed. - [Tom] What, with your clothes on? C'mon, I have a nice little bedtime story I want to tell you. - No, Tom, Tom, really, I can't, right for a fresh reporter. - Oh, them eyes, them nose, them lips. - So what was it you wanted to ask me? - Something very important. But first I want to know, who do those hats belong to? - Well, they belong to me. - You? - Yes, you know, girls are wearing mannish clothes now, and I'm gonna have a suit made and wear one of those hats. - No foolin'? Hey, I'll bet you'll look cute, at that. Come on, let's try one off on. - [Mary] Oh, no, Tom. - [Tom] Here, put this one on, let's see how it looks. No, I can't say I exactly care for that. - Doesn't seem to fit, does it. - [Tom] Well, yes and no, looks like it was made for a couple other fellas. - I think it makes me look effiminate. - [Tom] Well, maybe you can get away with it, here. (hat smacks) Try it on this way. (Mary giggles) Uh-oh, now I gotta buy you a horse. - Tom, really, it's getting late. Would you think it rude of me if I asked to be excused? - [Tom] Yes, I think it'd be darn rude, you refuse to talk to me on the telephone, now I'm here, I'm gonna make up for lost time. - Will you stop kissing me? - Well, I could stop breathing. (lips smack) - Sometimes I believe I hate you. - Can't you make up your mind? Oh, what a swell wife you're gonna make for me. - [Mary] I will not. - [Tom] Oh, yes, you will. - Maybe I'd better refresh your memory. I'm engaged to Arthur Hornsby and I'm going to marry him. - Rave on. - You get out of this house, and don't you dare come back again. - [Tom] Alright. - [Martin] Here's your drink, Mr. Tom. - Drink it yourself. (car horn blaring) - [Mary] Martin, show this person out. - How 'bout it, Martin, I'll show myself out. My pal the taxi driver's blowin' the horn for me anyhow. Bye, honey. Bye, Martin. - Martin, never let that man in the house again as long as you live. - As long as I live? - [Tom] Alright, I hear ya, I'm comin'. Take it easy, would ya, take it easy, I hear ya, I'm comin'! Hey, lay off that horn, will ya? Hey, hey, what's the matter, what happened to you? - [Taxi Driver] Maniac... - Ooh, another one. Push over, pal. Don't you worry, I'll take you to the hospital, there in a minute. (engine rumbling) - After the injection has taken effect, I'm to be placed in this box and buried. Now, please remember, gentlemen, it's imperative that I be revived after eight hours. - Are you of the opinion that eight hours is the longest period of time you could remain underground? - What would happen if you remained buried more than eight hours? - I believe it's safe for me to remain entombed for eight days, if necessary. Depends entirely upon the amount of fluid injected before the burial. - Ooh, uh, eight hours'll be sufficient proof of the validity of your experiment. - This is the restorative. My life depends upon the pumped injection of this fluid after the expiration of eight hours. It's to be placed in this cabinet. To you, Degar, I entrust the key. - I shall guard it faithfully, master. - Gentlemen, I'm ready. Alright, Degar. Professor Andre, will you please administer the first fluid? (beakers clinking) - Should he risk the death sleep, disaster, death! - Oh, he mustn't do it. Arthur! Arthur, you mustn't! - [Degar] It's done. (lid clunking) (Martin screams) - (stammers) I knew I was right when I said there was undertakers. - Remember, you have seen nothing! Hmm? (Martin whimpers softly) (frogs croaking) (coffin softly rattling) (dirt thudding) (phone dings) - Crestview, 0191. Night desk, this is Hartley talkin' again, the guy's just died, sure, it was the maniac. You call the police, I'm still at the hospital, I gotta get right back there. Oh boy, what a story. (phone rattling) - Just nine o'clock. - [Committee Member] He is to be revived in eight hours. - [Committee Member] That will be at 5:00 a.m. - [John] Well, gentlemen, I suggest that we wait in the house. (frogs croaking) (clock chiming) - [Committee Member] Do you believe this young man's experiment will prove a success? - [Andre] Personally, I'm doubtful. - [John] If you gentlemen will excuse me, I'll retire to my room to wait. - [Andre] Certainly, Mr. Rinehart, we'll excuse you. - [John] Thank you. - How long has he been dead? - Two hours. - Do you think they'll be able to revive him when they bring him up? - I don't know, but if anything should happen to the serum... - He would die. - You go back upstairs, I'll join you later. (lock clicking) (lock clicking) (John screams) - John! John. - [Mary] Oh, Degar. (Sarah sobbing) - [Degar] The maniac has murdered again. (Mary shrieks) (footsteps thudding) (Sarah quietly whimpering) - What's happened here? - Professor Rinehart's brother has been murdered. - That makes two murders the maniac's committed. Boy, what a story, where's that phone. Look out, fellas. (footsteps thudding) Crestview, 0191. - I must call the police. - Relax, they're on the way here now. Hello, night desk? Hartley again. 'Nother murder in the Rinehart home. Oh, no, no, besides the taxi driver. This time, it's Professor Rinehart's brother. Bye! (phone slams) (siren wailing) - [Bailey] Get out of the way. - Bailey! - They found him here. - [Tom] Maniac's just knocked off another one. - Where? - In that room over there. - Yeah? - Hey, wait a minute, we ought to warn everybody, everyone in this house is in danger. - [Bailey] Yeah? - [Tom] Listen, folks, for some unexplainable reason, the murderer's chosen this house for his sadistic acts of violence. We're all on the spot, anyone is liable to be his next victim. - I was just comin' to that. I want you all to get in the dining room and stay there 'till I lay my hands on this maniac. Come on, get movin', go on. - I'll make a note of everyone in the room. - I was just comin' to that, I'll make a note of all those present. - Well, let me do the writing for ya. - I'll do the writin' myself. What's your name? - [Gregory] Professor Gregory Bagolski. - What? - Professor Gregory Bagolski. - Here, you do the writin'. - I know the name of everyone here but this gentleman. - Professor John Andre. - Now listen, all of ya, I'm goin' outside, and I don't want any of ya to leave this room, no matter what happens, you understand? Come on. Fred, you stay here. Don't let anybody in or out without an OK from me, savvy? Come on, you fellas. (frogs croaking) - [Police Officer] Come on, come on, I said come on out here, come on-- - [Bailey] What's the matter with you, it's me! - [Police Officer] Oh, I thought you was the maniac, Chief. - [Bailey] You thought. Take these things off me. You're the dumbest clot I've ever seen. - [Police Officer] Ah, it was my mistake. (Sika moaning) - What the hell is that creature? - Sika, I forbid it, you hear me? I forbid it. - Degar, she may have something of importance to tell us. - I forbid it! - The man has murder in his eye. - Quiet, please. (Sika moaning) Degar, for my sake, permit the seance. Will everyone please help Sika by taking seance seriously? - Mary, you don't believe in this junk? - I do, Tom. Please try and help me. Professor? Professor Andre? - If you would excuse me, I'd rather not. I don't believe in this nonsense. - Where am I gonna put you? - I don't care where you'd put me, just as long as you would put me next to a door. - [Mary] Martin, turn the lights out when I tell you. - After the lights are out. Do not put them on until I command it. - Martin, turn out the lights. Everyone join hands. - Our departed master is trying to get into communication with us. His spirit is sad, it's very restless. It is trying to tell us who the murderer is. I see the face of the murderer. It is aflame, I can't make it out. - Sika, I forbid it, you hear me? I forbid it. - Now I see the face, it's coming forward. It's the face of a madman. - Stop! You hear me, stop! - The spirit will not be denied. Now I see it, it's very plain. Oh, it's... (sharp thudding) (Sika shrieks) - [Mary] Turn on the lights! - [Tom] Hey, don't go out of here, don't go out of here! - [Mary] Sika, what's happened? - She's dead. (Mary sobs) - [Bailey] What's the idea? - [Mary] There's been a murder! - [Bailey] You mean to tell me the maniac come into this room, killed her, and got away without any of you seein' him? - The lights were out. - What's the idea of the lights bein' out? - [Mary] We were holding a seance. - Well, you picked a fine time for it. People bein' murdered, and you're playin' games. Got to figure out how the maniac got in. - [Tom] Bailey, that wasn't the maniac, there's no newspaper clipping, that's proof of it! And what's more, he couldn't get in this room without us knowing it. - Everybody take your places at the table, just as you were when it happened, come on. Why don't you sit down? - Because I don't want to. - [Tom] Aw, he wasn't in the circle. - That's interesting, I'll talk to you later. You all in your right places? - [Tom] We were all sitting as we are now, the Professor was standing there, Martin was standing, where's Martin? (wailing) - [Bailey] What was that? (Martin sniffling and wailing) - [Bailey] How did you get there? - I don't know, boss, all I know, I was comin' in here, and makin' a door where there ain't one. - Come on outta there. (Martin whimpering) Alright, now, who sat here? Well, what's the matter with ya? Ya all dumb? Who sat here? What are ya all holdin' back for? - I'll tell you, it was Degar. - [Mary] You act as though that explained the murder. - [Sarah] It does. - Well! Now we're gettin' somewhere, bring him over here. Did you see this man kill her? - He was right next to her, twice he warned her not to divulge the name of Rinehart's murderer. When she insisted, he killed her. - Sarah, don't be ridiculous. - Nevermind that. - What motive would he have for killing his wife? - You take care of your paper. I'll solve this murder, go on, lady. - Professor Rinehart remembered him in his will. Degar knew that his share increased with every death among the heirs. He killed my husband and he killed this woman! - Is there anyone else who would benefit by this will? - I would. - Who else? - My fiancee, Arthur Hornsby. - Where is he? - Why, uh, he's in Boston. - Bailey, did it ever occur to you that with her husband dead, that she might benefit by the will? - Degar was the first one to discover the body of my brother-in-law, the first one to be beside my husband's body. - Officer, you can take my word for it, this man had nothing to do with any of the murders. - Get out, it's an open-and-shut case. This mug was out to murder all of ya. Put the cuffs on him, Dooley. Come on, I'm takin' you to headquarters. You stay here and watch the body. - Boss, he don't need no watchin'. - Well, I've solved another mystery. This is certainly gonna put a feather in my cap. - I knew you were comin' to that, you stick to me, pal, and I'll make you look like an Indian chief. (Bailey groans) - Come on, Dooley. - [Man] Come on, get it even, right, take your hands off of me. - [Police Officer] Oh, I'll take 'em off of you, come in here. (man grumbling) Hey, Chief, I found these two guys prowlin' all outside of the house. - [Bailey] Yeah, what are you two mugs doin' here? - [Committee Member] We were watching the grave. - Watchin' what grave? - [Committee Member] Arthur Hornsby's grave. - Arthur Hornsby's grave? One of the heirs. I thought you told me your fiancee was in Boston. - I can tell you all about him. - Please, Aunt Sarah, you musn't-- - You'll tell, Aunt Sarah, or I'll hold you for aidin' and abettin' a crime. - Tonight, these gentlemen buried Arthur. - Oh, then another heir is dead. When was he killed? - Arthur isn't dead, he was buried alive. - Buried alive? Not dead? What's goin' on here? - [Mary] It was an experiment. - Somebody's gonna get hurt around here with this experimentin'. Come on, you guys, tell me where this grave is. We're gonna dig up Mr. Hornsby. - [John A.] If Professor Hornsby is to be removed from the grave, it is imperative that we have possession of the serum he has formulated to revive himself with. - Take it easy, where is the serum? - In the laboratory, in the cabinet. The key is in his care. - Come on, hand over the key. - I have hidden it, no one shall open the cabinet but me. - [Bailey] Take him down, get the serum, bring it to the grave. - [Dooley] Okay, Chief. Come on, where's the laboratory? - If you will permit me, I will show you the way. - [Bailey] Keep an eye on that bird, don't let him get out of your sight. Come on, you guys, show me where that grave is. - [Police Officer] Alright, come on, boys, let's get out of here, come on. - Please don't go, Tom. Stay here with me. - Sure I will, honey, but why didn't you tell me of this experiment? - It's all been so terrible, I'd rather not talk about it. - [Bailey] Alright, alright, go on, keep movin', keep movin', show us where that grave is. Experimentin', huh? Buried alive. I'll get to the bottom of this thing. (Bailey speaking faintly) Come on, get movin'. Alright, where is it? - [Committee Member] There it is. - [Bailey] Alright, get busy diggin', get ahold of one of those shovels, you too. We'll find out about this thing. (shovels scraping) - [Dooley] Alright, let's get to it, get that stuff. - [Degar] It will take a few minutes to prepare this serum. - [Dooley] Alright, go ahead. - [Degar] Will you remove the handcuffs, please? - [Dooley] Nothin' doin', Sultan, what do you think I am, a sucker? - Do you care if I smoke? - [Dooley] I don't care if ya burn. - Have one. - Yeah, I'll have one. What kind of a cigarette is this? - [Degar] It is an Oriental cigarette. - [Dooley] Oriental, eh? (cigarette case clatters) (cabinet lock clicks) (shovels scraping) - [Bailey] See what's holdin' up Dooley. You go get that serum and bring it here. We'll be ready for it in a few minutes. - [Police Officer] Right, Chief. - [Bailey] Faster, faster! (shovels scraping) (frogs croaking) - Say, you, the chief wants that serum. - [Degar] Be careful, sir. If anything happened to this serum, it would mean the death of the young man. - 10 to one, he's playing a harp by now. So listen, Eddie, you better keep your eye on this guy. (door slams) - [Tom] Honey, I've got to be getting out there, I want to get that story. - [Mary] I wish I could go with you. - Honey, I wouldn't want you there when they take him up. Stay here, I'll be right back. (Mary shrieks) - [Tom] Mary! Mary? Is Miss Mary in here? - [Martin] Huh? Hey, there ain't nobody in here but us two. (Mary screams) - [Mary] Help! (footsteps clattering) - Mary, Mary! What are you doin' here? - [Degar] I heard a scream. - Somethin' happened to Mary, she disappeared right by my eyes. (Mary shrieks) (gunshot booms) (body thuds) - [Degar] The maniac. - [Mary] Tom! - [Tom] Mary, are you alright? (frogs croaking) (coffin scraping) - Now, move out of the way, everybody, I'll open the coffin. Are you ready with the serum, Professor? - [John A.] I have it here. - [Bailey] Give us a hand there, Mac. What's the big idea? I thought you told me ya buried him. - [Committee Member] We did. - [Committee Member] Oh, we laid him in this coffin. - [Committee Member] We brought him here ourselves. - [Bailey] I'm gonna hold ya all for murder. (Mary shrieks) Come on, help him out of there, grab onto him. Hold to him, don't let him go. Get a hold of that guy, come on. - Here is the man you want for murder. - Arthur! - [Bailey] Are you tryin' to tell me that this is the maniac? - Maniac is dead, killed by Mr. Tom. - [Bailey] Then who's this guy? - This is Arthur Hornsby. - [Bailey] The buried alive geek? - He's the murderer of Professor Rinehart, and John Rinehart, and, and Sika. Committed his crimes in the guise of maniac. Professor Rinehart suspected that the serums were a fake, and he killed his uncle when he went to investigate. He planned to kill all the heirs. - [Bailey] I don't believe it. - [Degar] Here is the way he escaped from the box. Then, he crawled in through an old tunnel, which leads to the basement of the mansion. Went up the stairs, into the house, where through hidden panels, he did the killings. - Do you deny this? - No, because sooner or later, even you would know he's telling the truth. - Take him away. Well, wise guy, I've solved another mystery. - Okay, sweetheart, compared to you, Sherlock Holmes was a traffic cop. - [Bailey] (groans) Come on, let's get out of it. - I am the maniac. Take heed, I am talking to you, and you, and you. If you dare tell anyone how this picture ends, if you dare reveal who the murderer really is, I'll climb into your bedroom window tonight and tear you limb from limb. I'll haunt you. Good night, sleep tight, pleasant dreams! (laughs diabolically) (hisses) (dramatic orchestral music)
