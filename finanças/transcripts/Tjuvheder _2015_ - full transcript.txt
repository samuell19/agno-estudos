Yes, hello? What? Hello. No, you haven't said anything like that to me. We said... You said a week. I haven't received any letter. I know what mail I have or haven't gotten. Hello, what did you say? You can't just come in here, if I am not at home. That doesn't work. I don't have anywhere to go. I don't have a place to put all of my stuff. That won't work for me. You have to give me a few extra days, you just do. I can't just be... Should I go out and get raped at night? You're just doing your job? I'm going to a job interview at 1 pm and I can't be home then. You can't come in here if I am not at home. That's trespassing. Yes, it is! I'll report it to the police! I'm going to a job interview. We'll talk after that. And then I'll pay. -Everything good with you? -Yeah, all good. Been a while. -Lucky me, finding you here. -This is the number to use from now on. -Hey! -How's it going? -All good. -You got anything? -Yes. -How have you been? 800? -I'll keep in touch. -Yeah, do so. It's a crisis. He ripped me off. Fucking hustlers! I've got to get some relief. Get real! You've gotten 200 grams. And I haven't seen a nickel. -I know. 50 grams then? -How are you gonna pull that off? What do I have to do to get you to understand? Rajje, I have been good to you too. You got a five from me last time. -100 bucks and that maniac... -Then you can give it back now. 24 hours in lock-up too, because of that fucking bum. You got any smokes? -I promise you'll get cash tomorrow. -Start pawning yourself. -What the fuck! Hello? -Get some dough for me. Can I at least get a smoke? You're so cruel! Fucking cunt! -Minna! Minna, wait! Wait! How are things? -Stressed out. -We can stand here and talk a little. -You got any needles or anything sharp? -Why are you so stressed? -I've got to get to the pub. Okay. You can leave shortly. How are things? -It's fine, I'm stressed. -Yeah, I understand that. -What have we got here? -Played the horses. -Horses? -Yeah. You're lucky this time, you know. Next time you won't be. -You're thinking about the lottery, Anders. -Just take it easy, Minna. See you around! Hey! Have you seen Tanja? You know, Tanja. No idea. Don't know what you're talking about. Can I finish my call, or what? Yeah, how many wheels do you want? Five? I'll call you when the mechanic has arrived. Yes. Okay. Bye-bye! Damn, you're freaking out! -Have you spoken to social services? -I'm going to. I see what's happening. talk to social services. Just call them. Bracelet? Seriously? I already have a bracelet. I need money from you. I need 400 bucks from you. Rob a drunk then! Do anything just as long as I get my fucking 400! You fucking...! -What are you doing? Breaking the phone? -I need that 400 bucks! You can't be slamming the phone. I don't know what you're talking about- -but you can't be slamming the phone. Don't you understand that? Give it up. Hello? It's the staff. Open up! Jens, what are you doing? You can't smoke here. Put it out. Don't you hear the alarm? -Here they are. -Hey, well done. -I've sold everything. -Keep the money, it's all tapped out. -I can't get a hold on the supplier either. -It's all tapped out? I'll let you know if I hear anything, so you can go get it for me. Do you have anything? Stop nagging! I'll call when it arrives. Tonni! -Your dealer doesn't have anything? -Yeah, unfortunately not. -Who was that in the car? -Why? -Are you someone's runner these days? -Yeah, why do you ask? I have a buddy who's sitting on some good stuff. -Okay. What do you want for that? -Just give me a dose for the tip. -I've had a string of bad luck lately. -Who's the guy? -Did you just talk to him? -Yeah, he's super chill. My regular guy. -If you have cash. -Yeah. -Show me. I can't just bring you... -See. -Okay. -Get in then. -He's at Angelo. Give me the cash. -I'll tag along. -No, what are you doing? -Of course I'm gonna tag along. I'm supposed to meet him alone. That won't work. -I can just stand outside. -He's just really paranoid. -It's not going to work. -I'm quiet. It's fucking eight grand! I'm trying to help you. Screw this. No, wait. You know who Christer Korsback is, right? -No, I don't. -You know, the guy in the car. -No. -Well you don't fuck with him. I'm just telling you. Don't fuck with this. You're not only fucking over me. -I don't cheat people, you know that. -Right, but I'm just telling you. Be back in three minutes. What the hell! Watch out! Can't you see that I have a child here?! -I have money now. -Minna, knock it off. You should've paid two months ago. It's too late now. -Don't touch that! I have the money! -No, Minna. Take what you need. -We're locking the apartment now. -You've been looking forward to this. No. -What are you doing with my stuff? -They're being stored for three months. -You have to keep track of that. -Who gets them out? And for what money? -I can't answer that. -Thanks. Yeah, the police, thanks. Yes, I'll wait. -Yes, connect me. -You're calling the cops?! -Back off! -Easy, easy! Minna, just leave. Hello, are you awake? We're from Convictus. They've called. We thought we'd take you to a shelter that has some space. We have the car over there. -Hello! We're here now. -Hello, is that Minna? Hi. -Are you going down to the office later? -Yes, are you coming along? -Yeah, I think I'll tag along. -You've called even though you're not allowed... -What the hell! -You're well aware of it, Katja. -Do you decide if I get to see my son? -Katja, take of one of these as well. Hey, do you have a lighter? Here! Oh, sorry. -You're leaving? -I'm going to a trailer park. -Akalla? -No, Haninge. -Do you live there? -I'm going to rent a camper. I think Benneth lives there. Do you know Benny Henebro? -My ex, or whatever you call it. -No. Can I get the lighter back? Thanks. -Minna, shall we go up and chat a little? -Sure - Bye! Then there's dope, that's just how it goes. It's great about the apartment. -It gets so damn lonely. -One shouldn't be alone. Do you know how many times I've heard that? You get your own apartment... Then it's old pals, booze, drugs and who gets kicked out? In this case it's you. And where are the pals? Gone. -I couldn't get a hold of anyone, sorry. -They must have left for the day. -Okay. -Wait, where are you going now? If you can't help me then it doesn't matter. We've just barely gotten started. They've gone for the day, it's late... Stay, and we'll spend the night planning. Tomorrow we'll get in touch with the social center. It's not a problem. You called the damn cops! You fucking snitch! Hey! -Hey! -What a hell are you doing?! -Hey what a hell are you doing? -Drive! It's okay. -What are you doing? -Drive! Damnit! -Hey, thanks for the ride. -The station is over there. Awesome. Take care! -Hello? -Minna? -Yes, who the hell are you? -Christer Korsback. Christer Korsback? Tonni mentioned you. And? -Fucking cunt! I'm going to cut you. -You're gonna cut me? Come on then, do it. I don't even live there anymore, so piss off, you fucking prick. Hey! Is there room for one more? I have money, wait... Somewhere. I have eight or nine here. How much did you say the rent was? -I didn't. 1500. -Is it some luxury vehicle? No, just a regular camper. But so if I tag along and I buy the camper from him, then you have no rent. -Are the cops after you? -No. They have a lot of problems out there with the neighbors and city hall. The cops aren't looking for me. I'm clean. Okay. Is that why you ran earlier? -What do you mean ran? -Where is that money from? My pension. I have a pension. It's honest money. No funny business, I'm the one taking you there, okay? Right? You have to talk to Boris there. He's in charge. There's still a liquor store downtown, right? -Do you know a Christer Korsback? -Christer Korsback? Isn't that the fucker from Rackasta? The pusher? Why? Nah, nevermind. Liquor stores, they're everywhere. I need a new SIM-card too, so that's great. -Nice! Where did you steal these? -Ahlens. -The one downtown? -No, I'm banned by the one downtown. -Seriously? Me too. -You are? -I usually steal by hair dye from there. -By request? Nah, I sometimes do people's hair. I do that as a side gig sometimes. I can do yours if you'd like, for free. See this here under, the green? I did it when I was high. So fucking weird. You get... -You get high? -Sometimes. I like speed. But I also don't like it, you know. Concerta works for me. -ADHD-medicine. -I know. -You've been involved as well? -I was a nurse for almost 15 years. -Are you joking? -No. I had a car, an apartment, and a man. Yeah, it's completely nuts, really. Well, a car I have now as well but... -I didn't live in it very often then. -What happened? Everything went to shit. My mom died. I got divorced. -Got fired -Is it a boy or a girl? -A boy. Leon. -And he like horses? Yeah, actually he likes all animals. Dogs most of all. -Has he been placed in a home? -Yeah, but it's... We're going to a treatment center, or a place in Borlange that's great. -So this just for a short while. -You miss him a lot? Just let me know if I babble too much. I do that sometimes, it's the ADHD. -It's okay. -I understand. It's okay. You just have to let me know. It's cool with me, really. -Do you have any kids? -No. No, hell no. It's too much of a fuzz dealing with people. I can't take care of a child, I can't even take care of myself. -You can still have a child. -I've got her, that's enough. -She's... -What's happening? -We'll have to sleep in the car. Here... Hey! This is Minna, who I told you about. -Mette and Kare. -Can I borrow a smoke? -Absolutely. Thanks. That hag with the dog has been going at it. Her little lap dogs are fancier than the dogs down here with us. -She's a little bit better than us. -Some little wobbly whippet? It's something. She calls about anything. -She must not have a life of her own... -Do you grow stuff? I do, I live there. Right now it's chill. Some kale and stuff. -It's perennial, all year around? -Perennials. But it's pretty cool. Do you like doing it? You've done it before? I was at a treatment center in Skane, we grew stuff there. The best gig! -It's relaxing, right? -Hey, Minna, go have a chat with Boris. -Better just get it over with. -What kind of guy is Boris? -Didn't he used to be a dealer? -Yeah he was, back in the 70s. He speaks for us when it comes to cops and debt collectors. That jerk, he sure can talk. He's also fancier than the rest of us. What's wrong with you? Did you get a hold on some bad dope? -You don't have to talk like that. -Kare! -He'll chill. -Minna, go talk with Boris. So what are you thinking now? -There are bits of cable above ground. -Hey, Benneth! -Haven't seen you in ages! -I figured you lived here. -Yes, unfortunately, but so it goes. -Okay. How are things? A lot has happened. I'm gonna be a dad. She's seven months pregnant, so it's just a couple of months left. I've stopped using the good, I have joined the program. Yeah it was a big deal, it was heavy, it was hard. But, really... I didn't have a damn choice. I smoke a bit of pot, a bit of speed. But that's it for me! -I get it. -I had to... -Hello! -Here she comes, my darling. -Bun in the oven and all. Congrats! -Thanks. Quite unbelievable, really! It really is. -Can you help me with this? -Of course - Take care Minna. -You too. -Is this a housing agency now? Are you Boris? You're the one to talk to about living here? We say no to most people these days. There's lots of folks, too many demands. -Why does Katja get to live here? -She's a nurse. I can get stuff. Stuff you need, if you want. -Like the stuff around your arm? -Yeah Good stuff? I'll say this: Do something else while you still have your teeth. -It's really hard if you're homeless. -Yes indeed. -When was the last time you were locked up? -It's been a while. I was in the clear last time, but got snitched out by the guy I lived with. -Anyone I might know? -The snitch? -Doesn't matter. He's at Skrubban. -The treatment center? Nah, the graveyard. He's a strawberry now. So the order has been restored? Okay. Don't bring any trouble. -And don't argue with our neighbors. -Okay. And remember, we help each other. Don't forget that. -Good stuff? -Yeah, why? -That's definitely cat gold (fake). -Hell no, this is real gold! Meow. Meow! -Well then... -5,000, here you go. -Five? I can maybe do eight. -Alright let's do it. Here's eight. -It's a deal. -Cool. It's good. Hello, Sabina! -Minna. -Aww... Intruders. -Damn, this is so hokey! -What do you mean? -I remember this smell from when I was little. -Did you live in a camper? Nah, my grandma took care of me during the summers. -You went camping? -Nah but she owned a camper. You never lived with your mom and dad? Mom was a drunk, so... It was a lot of foster homes and that kind of shit. -But there are good places. -Good people? Yeah. At the last place they even paid for my driver's license. So it exists. -I trying to grow this celery. -I don't think they'll survive. Better eat them up now. Then for spring I thought I'd plant some potatoes and carrots. -Mette! -Then we can do some bigger stuff. -Do you still have your old man's stuff? -What stuff? Here I've got some ties. -Somebody died? -Wedding. His daughter is getting married to a taxman. -Fancy people. -You'll need some debt restructuring then. -The one with the skulls fits perfectly. -I like that one. Here, let's try it out. Hold on, let's see... This is gonna be great, you'll see. -Have a look. I don't know. -I'll have a look. -Damn! This looks ridiculous. -I can tie nooses. We can take two more ties, and we can braid them. -Someone's coming. -Who is it? -I don't know, somebody. -People from city hall. -Hello Boris! -Hello! Now we're here again. Last time there had been a fire. Now there is a real fire. There's been burglaries. Here and over there. -And you know that it's us, for sure? -Don't get involved in this. -Presumably you or your friends. -Go away! -Am I your delivery boy or something? -Go away! Yeah so now it's very busy up at city hall. We've set another meeting. More eviction threats... Make sure you clean up fast when the containers arrive. -Sort this out now. -This is the last chance, Boris. There won't be another. -Are they going to fight? -What are you doing? Don't touch that! -Don't touch my stuff, Boris! -Is this your stuff?! Yes damnit, stop pulling it out! This is your stuff? You don't shit where you eat, don't you get that? Oh really? I live with a girl named Minna, she has a cat. Yes, very pretty. Actually, maybe you can come out here and visit. Does it start now? -We'll root for the woman who's barefoot. -Mom, you'll watch it as well? -Of course, I'll watch it as well. -We're gonna get some chips and soda. I understand, Leon. Run and get it now before it starts. -Promise you'll watch. -Yes, I'll be watching it. -Goodbye mom! -Bye-bye! This piece of crap... Hey! -This piece of shit doesn't work. -Okay. -Do you know how this works? -I don't know, I can take a look. -Do you have a box? -You don't need it. Okay. Hmm... Pressing that again doesn't help. Menu, list of channels, okay. -Why does it keep showing that?! -Take it easy. Okay. -No. Piece of shit doesn't work! -Shit, are you crazy or what? Fuck! Do you wanna be alone? -I can leave, if you want me to. -I can't do this! I'm leaving. -It's too cramped. Keep stepping on each other. -Where are you going to go then? Huh? It's so damn cold. I can't do this. I'm freezing so much. -Hey! How's it going? -It's going alright. Hello! Do you know someone I can buy a radiator from? Peter Fence can probably get one. He can fix you up with anything. -Soon? -I'll call tonight. -So, tomorrow... -Do you want something for it? -Nah, it's cool. -Benny, don't forget about the welfare center. -What are we doing there? -Insurance and all that. -Yeah but it's cool, we can do both. -Okay. -Bye then! Take care. -Bye! -Here. Damn nice, it's like new. -I'll give you 100 bucks for it. -It's practically new, 150? -She just got released from prison. -Really? When? -Yesterday. -Yesterday? -Yeah I just got here from Faringso. Who can resist that smile? We have to help each other. -Yes. -Hope this works for you. Good to see you. -Yeah, awesome. -See you! Good luck! Take care! Wait, wait. Here comes the goods. -What? -Can you lend me a few hundred bucks? -What a hell, Benneth. -I'll get you back tomorrow. -What do you mean tomorrow? From where? -The pension. -It's Saturday tomorrow. -You get them on Monday then. So you did want something for this. You're the same old you, can't change that. -Yes, you're perfect. -Damn now I want to get high too. And I'm out of ADHD pills. One moment, darling. Benneth! What the hell! Hey man! -Everything cool? -Nah, a lot of trouble and shit. -I'm coming straight from the cops, per usual. -Oh really? Doing fucking piss tests for a minor narcotics offense. I’m so fed up! -Yeah, so it's all tapped out? -Right now, but you know me. -Hello Carina! - What did you have in mind? -Just a little, a few grains. -Ride with us! -We're going to the insurance agency. -We'll have enough time. -Are you joking? -No, we'll make it. -You stay away from my man! -What the hell was all that about? -Yeah... Hey, can I borrow your lighter? Thanks. -That looked like trouble. -Yeah, shit man. I'm going to have a kid and I do drugs, what can I say? -Shall we go or what? -Yes, please. -He's not here yet? Where is he? -He's coming, any second now. -I'll just check out the goods. -You do that. -Computers, are you good at that? -Yeah, at stealing them. -Here's my man! -Hey Korsbäck! -Hello! -Benneth. -Yesterday? -Damn, I couldn't answer... No excuses. Knock that off. You have to answer when I call. My friend here wants five grams of speed. Do you have that here and now? -Yeah - You want it now? -Yeah. Let's go to her... Hey, what are you doing? Are you coming or what? Hello? I need the money. -Yeah, I'm peeing damn it, chill out. -You can pee later. -We're waiting. I need the money. -Who is it? -Some chick he knows. -I need the money. Hello? -I've gotten my period. -I only have enough for one gram. If we said five grams, then it is five grams. Get out here now! Honestly, you have to come out now. Damnit, get your shit together. Come out now. If we said five grams, then it is five grams. Come out now! Shit! Get your stuff. We have to empty the building. Do you have stuff? You got a guy? Damn, you fucking whore! I've been standing here waiting for you! Can't you hear what I am saying. Are you a fucking idiot or what? Come on now! We are three men here waiting for you. I'm gonna kick the fucking door down and drag you out! Tonni, can I talk to you? Come with me to the office! -Christer, I'm gonna call the cops on you! -Get out of the way! Go to hell! -Tonni, come here now. -I'll call you later. -Yeah, okay. -I haven't done anything. Christer! -So there won't be anything? -No. Tonni lost his apartment for a couple of grams of speed. -He can stay with us. -You've got a camper? -Yeah, in a week. -Call me about it. -Hello, what are you doing? -Hey, sorry I fell asleep while smoking. -It seems like there was a real fire here. -You realize you've lost your place here right? -What? But... -Tonni, there has to be trust. I'm not involved anymore. -Benneth! Who hell are you calling? -What the fuck were you doing? He freaked me out. I didn't like that guy. -Who the hell are you calling? -Carina. -So now it's speed. You've been smoking. -You know how bad I feel. Feel bad? You have been up twice already with the board. You're going to lose... We'll be in touch! Thanks boys! Minna, I've lost Leon's bracelet. Can you hear me? -Katja, I'm sleeping. -It's completely gone. I can't... -Damn! I haven't even been in here. -Have you looked in the car? -Can I buy some hair dye from you? -You can have it if you fix some coffee. I want to go and see Leon. I think this will look really hot with a little... -To spice it up a bit, with a little red. -It'll be fresh. I'll do one more. Can I have one more coil? Let's do this... Can you keep the time? My ADHD... I get so... I can forget. -Then it'll fry the hair, and that's not good. -I'll keep track, thanks you so much! -Damn, that's nice! -Yeah, really. Come in! -Hello! -Hey! How's it going? -Going alright, what about you? -Not bad. -Did Pejdan leave some tools here? -No. -Nah, he didn't leave shit. -We've got to fix Jonny's camper. -He's gonna sell it. -Who's going to live there? -Tonni, Christer Korsback's dude. -Boris has a bunch of tools. -He does? Great, thanks. -What Tonni are you talking about? Benneth! -Why the hell are you going to drag him here? -You're so whiny! He's scum. He's a fucking weirdo. He's no good. -You're best friends with him? -No, but I know who he is. He's a dealer too. You're gonna bring trouble here. Hey, what's going on? You're bringing a fucking cunt here. Tonni. -Yes, he's coming in a week, and? -He's no good. I've told you before. He's no good, a real cunt. You say that he's good, but he's not. I have lived here for two years. Who are you to meddle in my affairs? -You're selling it and leaving? -Minna! Come on now! -We help each other. No bullshit. -You're always so big on solidarity. It's Christer Korsback's dope that you're after. Did you talk about Christer Korsback? No, I did not. -Why are you lying? -I'm not, not at all. -I heard you and Benneth talk -Just now, yeah. But I didn't before. Like... I don't get it... I'm trying to get the car started so you can go meet your boy. -Goddamnit! -Pull the choke lever. The bracelet too? Did you steal it? Did you steal it? Minna! Come here! -Hello! -She's the one who has a cat. You look like each other! Long hair... I like guys with long hair. God, it has gotten so long! -Does Sanna usually get you? -Sometimes. -Hi Katja. -We just wanted to say a quick hello. -This is Minna. -Sanna. -We thought Leon could visit the trailer park. Perhaps we can talk about that at the next meeting instead? -Good. -When is it? It's on Monday. Okay. It's pretty important that I know when the meetings are, right? It's Gunilla who lets you know about the meetings, not me. -I usually get notified by Gullvi. -Okay, Gullvi then. -It's however not me, Katja. -Can you go and sit in the car? Leon can stay. -You can stay. Shouldn't we talk about the dogs? Stop it! Leon and I had a nice moment and were coming together after what's happened. After last Saturday there are now rules that even your son knows about. He knows this is wrong. He needs routines and security. Can you tell us more about what her son needs? -Go and sit in the car. -Go home and we'll talk on Monday. -This is just stupid. -We don't have a home to go to. Are you joking with us? We don't have a damn home to live in. How much do you get paid these days for taking a foster child? -Minna, knock it off. -How much do you get paid? And this is who you bring to meet with you son? -What a hell! -Knock it off! -Can I feel? Is she awake? -I think she's sleeping right now. I need money. Can we go and lay down some copper? Sure, but then we'll be using the car again. -Yes, of course. - You've got ID? -What? No. -I can sell without ID. -You've got gas? Yeah, no worries. When I'm standing there with my 12 year old at the schoolyard, it's not that's it's... The thing is that it's the same situation where I'm going to be completely ruined. -If everything is okay with you? -Absolutely You think you have friends. And then that fucking cunt still snitches you out. -You don't think I can hear you? -It's not that. -I'm not drinking away my kid, alky. -I'm not talking about that, tweaker. -Shut the hell up! Watch yourself! -At least I'm not a tweaker. -I didn't drink away my kid! -You're yelling that I'm an alky! Hey, shut your mouth! I'll kick your stomach in! Hey! Hey, Benneth! Come down. -You've got anything? -No, sorry. It's all tapped out. -Come on! -No, it's true. I don't lie. -What's wrong with you? -Nothing. By the way, he's not coming. Tonni, he's been arrested. Just so you know. I think that she's dishonest. It's not just about this here. She's like... dishonest. And it's like... She's up to stuff... Christer... I don't get it. I have said that all along... We shook hands. Christer? Christer Korsback? Yeah. It feels like she's hiding herself. -Like she's hiding herself from someone. -From Christer? Why would she be hiding herself from Christer? What do you mean, does she owe him money or something? Or what? -Did she rip him off? -Damnit. You have to take it easy with the booze. -I ripped off Tonni. -Who's Tonni? Christer Korsbacks dealer. But it's alright. They are not going to come here. Tonni got locked up. -So you didn't rip off Christer Korsback? -I didn't know that it was him. -Sorry for lying. -He doesn't know that you are here? Nah, he doesn't even know what I look like. And Tonni's been arrested- -so he can't pinpoint me either in any damn way, so it's chill. They're not coming here. But this is between you and I, okay? Okay? -Yeah, what a hell do you think? -Okay. -Hi Carina! -Hi. -Everything good? -Sorry about yesterday. -What a damn drunk I am. -Nah, what do you mean? I just talk about of shit. I talk about rumors that aren't even true. -I had misunderstood the whole thing. -The thing with Christer? I had totally misunderstood that whole thing. -What? Rumors? Bullshit? -Damnit, why can't I just shut my mouth? We have to squeeze these a bit. Damnit... Why do I talk so much shit? Maybe I said something wise about the babies and stuff at least? -Yeah, I think so at least. -Good! Say hi to Benneth. -Yeah, will do. Take care. -Bye! -Who the hell are these people? -A car has arrived with some dudes. Is someone waiting for them? -Minna, what a hell is it? What's happening? -It's okay. What's happening? -Minna! Hey! -Hey! Oops! Do you recognize me? How did it go out at Hogdalen? Did you freak out completely? I thought I saw a cop there. This is how it is: It doesn't say idiot written on my forehead, right? -No. -I'm going to tell you how it is: It was 9 large to begin with. You now owe me 50 large. -50? Christer, isn't that a bit much? -You don't make a sound. -Can we talk reasonably about it? -50,000? You can't steal from people. You've ripped off Christer. -What do you mean? -Idiot! -What are you doing? -She's ripped off Christer. Not him, it was Tonni. It was Tonni, not him. -Tonni is one of his boy, Minna. -It was my money, don't you get that? If you had reach out then we could've talked about it. But you've been hiding. This is how it is: you're going to pay me back and you're going to do it right away. -I don't have any money. -I don't give a shit. Then you'll have to walk the streets! -I'll burn down every camper here. -Christer, take it easy. Knock it off. -Don't touch me! -What are you talking about? -She's ripped him off. -Knock it off. Another word from you and I'll cut you! I'll cut you, do you understand? -Christer, we should talk calmly. -Back off! - You don't play in my league! Not anywhere! Another fucking word, I'll split you up, you fucking cunt! You might be the king over these fucking bums, I don't give a shit! Fuck off! Go to hell! Your time is gone, do you understand? 50,000 tomorrow, Minna. See what you have now done? See what you have done? And you don't say anything! What are you doing? Where are you going? Where are you going? Katja, come on now! -I'll tag along. -You can't tag along where I'm going. -I'll tag along, it's cool. -I'm finished boozing, okay? Split then, goddamnit. Go to hell. Hey you owe me some money. You've been living here for free, moocher. Katja, come on now! Katja! -I'm so damn sorry. -Get a grip. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just so sad. I'm sorry, okay? We've talked this through here. You've to get your things sorted. You have to leave if people come here and cause trouble. -Boris, do you agree with this? -We've made a decision together. That's how it is. If you caused a mess then you'll have to clean it up too. I understand, that's fair. It's okay. I'll sort it out. Hey, how's it going? Let's go inside. I have to solve this somehow. It would be nice if you mediated somehow. It's okay, we'll talk to my dad. We're related to Christer. It'll get sorted, it's okay. He's completely wrong. Some fines and interest, sure. You understand that. Yeah, but this is so maxed out, it's completely insane. We'll have to lay out some decent payment plan, and things will be fine. It's cool, he'll be there soon. Just be honest, tell it like it is, otherwise he'll get mad. Can I have a smoke? Thanks. Hey! What a hell is this here? You were supposed to come alone. You know what you're doing right? Did you stop using your Aspergers medicine? Sit down in the car! Hey! -You've got something for me? -Yeah. -40-50 damn good customers in this phone. -Listen, listen. Stop with that. Put that back down in your pocket, and I'll tell you what we're going to do. Listen. You'll take Tonni's place and do what what he did to bring in money for me. -I can't. The cops are after me. -Choose between this or walking the street. He wants to help you. I didn't cause this mess! You've caused a damn hell for me! -A payment plan then? -Shut up! You're going to take Tonni's place, do his stuff and make money for me. I know you're really good at this. You're creative. You know how to do this. -Okay, when do we start? -Now. Get in the car and follow. We'll drive ahead. -Do you have a place to measure this up? -What do you mean? -Do you have a place to measure this up? -Yeah Good, let's good there. Just a little more, then it's good. That's a rip off, come on now. I'm the one who has to sell it. Quiet! I'm the one getting busted for this. This is shit. It's only sugar now. Goddamnit, shut up! I'll cut you, you fucking whore! Be quiet now! You've caused enough problems for me! You just have to go sell! I'll beat you black and blue. Take this! -Damn idiot. -It's just fucking sugar now. Go to hell! Are you at Bestaller? You know, that place on Hogbergsgatan. Yeah, you get used to it, but I'd like to... -Hello! -Hey! -How are you doing? -Good. And you? Yeah, it's alright. Can you help me? -Okay. -You don't have even money? And there are the pigs. Time to leave, they're scoping. This is not a good place. Yes, hello, Janne! I'm there in two minutes. -Hello. -Can you get half a case? -My brother in Kramfors needs it. -Half a kilo? Yes, absolutely. I'll call you when I've got it. How are things otherwise? You got evicted? You live out at the Haninge trailer park? -Yeah it's such a mess out there. -With Boris? he's the king there. -You know him? -Yeah, everyone knows Boris. -We'll talk Minna. Take care of yourself. -Good luck! Minna! Minna! Come here, we're gonna talk you little shit! What a hell! Calm the fuck down! You're selling dextrose powder. I've been doing this for 20 years! -It's great stuff. I use it myself. -I'm taking it all now. If you had been a dude you'd been dead a long time ago. Good. The money. I'm gonna have the dough. What?! I'm gonna cut you in your eye! I'm gonna put this here right in your face. Shut up! Damn little whore! What a hell... Hello? Excuse me. You cannot unleash your dogs. They are bothering. -They bark and around loose. -We live here. We also live here. We live right on the other side. We must be able to pass. There are people who are afraid of dogs. It's about respect. I think this is poor behavior. Come on now, Minna. Goddamnit! Or are you going to work it off? Who is it? -The guy in the vest. -Danne Roos? Have another look. -Are you sure? -Yes. Fucking cunt! I gave you the money for the drugs, you damn pig! Three months. I take it one day at the time. How's the 12 step program? Is the staff good? -Hello? Do you guys know Katja? -Yes, I know Katja. -Can you give this to her? -Do you want to leave a message? Nah it's okay. Thanks. Minna! Damn, were you just going to split? No, I just didn't want to disturb. -How are things? -How are things going for you? -Is it going well, or? -It's... -Here? -It's going well, it's going real well. -I'm going to find out about Borlange... -Katja, the group is about to start! Yeah, I'll be there in a second. I'll find out about Borlange anytime now. It's looking really good. I've looked. They have another room. And they also take cats. -You've looked that up? -Yeah. You can think about it anyways. Man you're crazy! Thanks. -It laid under... Yeah, between... -Think about it anyways. -Will you think about it? -When is it? -Any day now. -I'm working off that debt now. It's going a bit slow, but damnit, I'm going to try. Okay. -Hey! You've got some stuff? -Take care, dude. I'm not going to give you a five. A ten if anything. I'm sorry. We'll take a ten. No problem. 1,800? Howdy! Things are good? It's cool. Come here! -Things are good? -Yeah, it's cool. -Yeah I know. I'll sort it out. -Okay, now. -It's not that much. -No, but 200. You can't have more. -I hope you understand everything. -Yes, absolutely. It's starting to be a bit much now. What happened last time will never happen again. You should know that. -But this is good stuff right here? -Yeah. Here you've got half a kilo. Yeah, this is a lot of money. The dude you're selling it to, do you trust him? -I've known him for 10 years -You've done business before? -Yeah. Janne Krona is solid. -Is he? -There hasn't been any trouble? -No. -That's that. Anything else? -We're finished after this here, right? I've counted on this. We're finished now, right? -Hey Minna! -Hey! What's happening? I don't know where my brother is. He has trouble finding his way. Here we go, someone's calling. Yeah, it's him calling now. Where are you? Stay there, I'll come and get you. I'll go and get him. He's standing just around the corner. I don't think you're buying any car. Who are you meeting? We're supposed to meet by Gullmars and buy a Volvo Bullshit, who are you meeting? -Wait... -40,000 in cash? Watch out! Are you okay? Should I call an ambulance? Hey? -Katja? You've got a call. -Okay, thanks. Hello? Minna, Minna, wait, wait, calm down. I can barely hear what you are saying. What? What do you mean hit by a car? I'm behind the gas station between Hogdalen and Ragsved. -I've really done a number on myself. -Call Benneth. Minna, call Benneth. I called Benneth, I just called him, but he's not answering. His phone is off. -You have to call for an ambulance. -No hospital and no ambulance. -Why not? -They check there. -Who checks? What? -The cops. They check the hospitals. I can't come, Minna. Do you understand? I understand. It's okay. -Was it something bad? -No, it's not a problem. Minna? Minna? Come on. Do you think you can stand up? Come here. -Here... here... -Take it easy. -Minna, are you sure? Did you faint? -No. -Like, you're sure? -Yeah. -Shit! Do you feel nauseous? -Sort of... -The wound itself doesn't look so bad. -Ouch! Sorry, I just wanted to check to see if it had gotten dirty. -Don't touch it with your fingers. -It'll have to be washed. -Did you mess it up? -No, it's okay. I've just got to... I just have to call and double-check. Mette, I think you have to wash it with a cloth or some lukewarm water. -Has there been a fight? -No, she's got a problem. I understand that. If there has been trouble with Christer then she'll have to leave. -I don't have a clue. -A chick shouldn't come here and ruin things. Give it a rest! -What are you yapping about? -I'm talking to Mette. -You're yapping. -If there is trouble with Christer she has to go! -She's staying. -She's staying? Will it be your responsibility? -I'm talking to Boris. Your responsibility? -Knock it off. -What did he do? -It wasn't him. I was chased and got hit by a car. -Damn drug smuggling. -Is that true? Yes. -So it wasn't Christer then? -No. It was the damn cops. Damn that's Anders. How the hell did he find his way here? Fucking Janne Krona! Ouch! Damn snitching cunt. Go away from here, I'll take care of it. -Do you need help? Do you need anything? -No, it's okay. Please, Kristian. Don't say "aborted treatment" one more time. No, don't say that again, because I'll be there before 11pm. And I'm hurrying there now. Of course I'm not lying. I need all the papers. I'm going to get them. I'll be there after that. Bye! -Why are you here? -Minna Sundqvist, which one is hers? -What Minna? Minna who? -Minna. -What do you mean Minna? -Do I need to spell it out? -Minna. You know who I mean. -We'll call our friends then. -So they can have a look around here. -Yeah, I'm clean. I mean I'm clean. -Hey! -Minna lives in that camper up there. -Probably in there hiding. -Okay, thanks. -You don't have a clue, huh? -What are you thinking? -Are you a little snitch? -People in the bushes, cops -Are you a little snitch? -A little snitch? Think clearly now. You're ruining everything this way. -Hello? -Who are you? -I don't know anything. -You know when you last saw her right? -I don't have the time. -You must answer these questions. -I don't have anything to do with this. -You can leave soon. -When did you last see Minna? -I don't know anything about Minna. Wait! Hey, wait up! We must talk to you before you leave! -Wait! -No! No! -Take it easy! -I have to be at Dagglantan at 11pm! -I'll lose my kid if I'm not! -Then you shouldn't be fighting. -I don't have anything to say! -Calm down! -Why are you arresting her? -She's fighting. -I didn't see that. -No. You can't arrest her. What do you mean fighting? Let her go, please. I haven't done shit. I'm sober. I'm going to lose Leon, do you understand that? -Anders! Anders! -Back off! Back off! Go around! She doesn't have anything to do with this. Let her go. You've got me now, damnit! Let her go! -Ease up a bit damnit. -The way it is now, she's been hitting. Fucking cops! Shit, this is just too much! Damnit! Ouch! -Where did you hide the stuff? -I haven't hidden any stuff. -Been patted down? - What's your name? -Minna Sundqvist. Okay, I'm going to put you in the police car here. Watch your head! -I have to go to Dagglantan. -You have a head-wound, right? -Are you in pain? -If you arrest me I'll lose my son. Have you been hit anywhere else on your body? You? How are you feeling? We'll have to stop at the hospital. Huddinge. She's been hit somehow. -Can you get Anders? -He's busy with other stuff. It's damn important. Get Anders. I've got something that he wants. -Anders? -Yes, Anders. Can you get him? -Hey! -Hey! What are you taking me for? What we are taking you for? The apartment stuff. Minor possession and assaulting an officer. Let her go, and I'll tell you where I left the drugs. It's better if you get me for serious possession, right? -For you mean I mean. -Yes. We'll let her go and I'll take responsibility for it, okay? Yes, but it's up to you. -So, I can leave? -Yes. -Okay? -It's one of those magazine bins. Behind the kiosk in Hogdalen. Under it. -One of those they leave the papers in? -Yeah. Is that the kiosk by the subway in Hogdalen? -Ja. -Bra. -Hey! -Hey!
