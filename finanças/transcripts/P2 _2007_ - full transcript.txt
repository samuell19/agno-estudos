Yes. I redrafted the contracts to include the new stipulations. - Then where are they? - I'm faxing the revisions now. Did you make all the changes I asked for? - Yes, I included the 4 % increase... and the extra two million. - No. If it's a 4 % increase, then you have to add at least three million dollars. No. That's not what I was told. - And who told you that? Their lawyers. - They're all idiots. This is a total lack of communication. - You know what? If's ok. I had no way of knowing, sir. - Ok, look. This is what I need you to do. Sir, can I put you on hold for a second? - Ok. Thanks. Hi, Jody. Mr. Harper wants to see you in his office. - Great. Of course. You still want me to fax those? - It's ok. You don't have to. I'm not even done yet. You should go home. - Are you sure? Yeah. It's late. I don't want your parents to worry. Get out of here. Ok. Merry Christmas, Angela. - Merry Christmas, Jody. Hi, Lorraine. Yeah, of course I'm going to make it. Just let me call you back. Ok? In a few minutes. I promise. OK. Still on the Morgan deal, hm? - What can I do for you, Jim? I... I don't know how to... Angela, I feel terrible about what happened. It's ok. It's fine. Let's just not worry about it, ok? No, no, no. It's not ok. I acted like a real jerk. I'd had too many drinks and... you know how these Christmas party's can be. You know we had a baby last year. And it's been a hard year. - I'm sure that it has. I simply want to tell you that I'm just really, really sorry. Ok? Apology accepted. Ok. Thanks. Merry Christmas, Angela. - You too, Jim. You calling me from work? I thought you were going home first. I brought everything with me. Don't worry. - God, I am so late with this dinner. Did you pick up the Santa Claus costume? I hope you didn't forget it. I didn't forget it. It's in the car. I think Dad is more excited than the kids. Believe me, I can't wait to get out of here and see you guys. Jimmy, Put that back. Do you want Santa to come tonight or not? - Hey, Mommy. I want Santa to come. - Well, then help me set the table. Ok. Please don't be late. - I won't. I promise. I won't. Ok, bye. - Bye. Ok. Jesus! - My God. Sorry, Angela. I was just locking up the floors. I didn't know anybody would be working... this late on Christmas Eve. - Yeah, me neither. Sorry. I'll come back later, alright? - Actually, if you wouldn't mind waiting, I'll lock up my office and I'll take the elevator down with you. Ok. Sure. - Ok. Two seconds. Do you work all night? - Yeah. But they're closing the building for the next three days. Besides, I get New Year's Eve off. - Oh, that's good. Yeah, I hope to get home in time for the girls to open up the presents. How are they? - Great. Come on, your parents can't stand me. - You're wrong, Doug. They love you. So, where are you going this evening? - To my sister's house in Jersey. Jersey? I thought of you more as an Upper East Side girl. Yeah, upper east side of Maine, actually. I grew up on a farm, Karl. Now I'm having trouble believing that. - Don't let the fancy clothes fool you. - I keep it real. Come on. - If that's what you call it, ok. Keeping it real. - Good night, Karl. Merry Christmas, Angela. - You too. I'll see you soon. Yeah. Yes. No. I promise you. I'm leaving right now. I know. I know. I'm sorry, but I'm in the elevator. 25 minutes tops. I can't hear you. What? Lorraine, you're breaking up. Hello? You've got to be kidding me. You've got to be kidding. Ok. Come on. Come on. Come on! Oh God. What am I going to do? I'm going to get out of the car. That's what I'm going to do. Shit. Hello? Jesus. - Rocky. Rocky. Rocky. What are you doing? Heel. Stay. Down. Down. Sorry about that. - That's ok. Look, can you unlock the door to the elevator room? My car won't start. And I need to get upstairs and get a cab. - Yeah, I can. I just have to find my key cards. Sorry. Where are those darn keys? I was about to do my rounds, anyway. So... Ok. - What happened to your car? I have no idea. - You probably left the lights on. No, I don't think so. I'm usually pretty good about that kind of thing. People do it all the time. It's instinctive. I mean, you drive down here and it's dark. It happens. Ah. Here we go. Great. - You know, actually, I just thought. I have a charger in the back, so if it is your battery we could probably... You could use that. - Oh, thank you. But I really should just take a cab. I'm so late as it is. - I don't know. It'll probably take longer to get a cab. It's Christmas Eve, so, I don't know. It's up to you. Whatever you want. - How long will it take? Just a few minutes. Give me one second. It doesn't look... like New Yorkers are actually going to be able to celebrate a white Christmas. Maybe next year. Now, with the beautiful metropolitan opera in the background, let's check out the temperatures for the tri-state area... Alright. Which way to your car? - Over there. Ok. Working late, hm? Yeah, I know how you feel. Yeah, these are pretty reliable cars for the most part, right? They're supposed to be. Right. Positive. Negative. Ok, alright. Try it. Turn her over. - Ok. Strange. Ok. Hang on. Can you turn your headlights on? Weird. Try turning the keys again. Damned. - Ok. I guess turn the headlights off. You know what? That's it. I... You've been a great help, but I give up. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I don't know what happened. I thought I could do something about it. - That's ok. You've been great. Can you just let me in the elevator room? - I was just trying to help. I know, and I appreciate it. Thank you. Hey, listen, I know you're upset about your car not starting, but it's the holidays, you know? It's time to be thankful. No. You know what? You're right. I should be thankful. I... I prepared a small Christmas meal for myself. You could join me if you want. I'm just kidding. - Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm exhausted. But really, thanks for your help. Oh, you're welcome. Maybe some other time, yeah? Yeah, sure. Alright. Here you go. You don't want me to call you a cab? - No. I've got a number in my bag. Alright, suit yourself. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Karl? Hi. Can I get a car at 2370 Park Avenue, please? Are you sure? No, that's ok. I'll wait. Thanks. Hey, Lorraine. You're not going to believe what happened. No. Actually, my car wouldn't start. Look, just start without me. I'll be there within the hour and I'll make it up to them. Ok. I'll see you soon. Bye. Hello? Oh, oh, great. Thank you. Thank you. Ok. Ok. Oh, come on. What? This is not happening. Is this a joke? No, no. You've got to be kidding me. Karl? Karl, where are you? Is anybody here? Come on, come on, come on. What? Just one second. Ok? I'll be right back. One second. Hello. Can you hear me? Look, I've got a cab waiting for me out front. Can you open the front gate, please? Hello? No. No. No, no, no, no. No. No. Damned. Why would you leave me here? Wake up, damned. The cab just left. Hey! I'm still in here. Wait! Great. It's ok. Just... Hello? OK. Stop being paranoid. Just go down to the office. Hello? Ah. Oh, fuck! Goddamned! No! Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. You've been a good little girl. Oh, it's ok. It's ok. You're alright. You're alright. You're alright. Ok? Alright? You're not looking so good. Are you ok? Take it easy. It's ok. What happened to me? What time is it? You just fell. You'll be alright. I don't feel good. I'm going to be sick. - I'll get some water. I'll get you some water. - Watch out! Be careful! You're going to hurt yourself. Try and stay calm. Oh, oh. Ok. It's ok. It's ok. Here. Here. Ok? Alright? I'm going to help you up. Ok, now? I'm going to help you up. Here you go. Ready? Alright. Here you go. It's ok. Alright. Ok. Try to relax. I'm going to clean this up. Ok. Clean this up. Ok. Ok. Alright. I'll be right back. Hungry? I got turkey, mashed potatoes. I got cranberries and I even got some cornbread. Oh man. I am... I'm sorry about this. I was just teasing. I didn't mean to scare you. Oh man. I hope it's still warm. If not I have the microwave, so... Are you feeling any better? What happened to my clothes? Like I said, you fell, and your clothes got dirty, so... Maybe you'd like some wine. It'll help you relax a little, you know? - Look, I don't know what you're doing, but you'd better just fucking untie me. This is a California wine. It's a Sonoma County. That's where I'm from. It's beautiful up there. Where are you from? What do you want? - I want to know where you're from. I'm from Readfield. Where's that? - Why don't you tell me what you want? I just want to know where Readfield is. And I want you to relax. Cheers. Ok. I'll make a toast. Here's to good friends and hometowns and Readfield, wherever that is. Listen. Tom. - Tom. I have some place to be. You know, I have obligations. Yeah. I know. Way too many. You don't make time for yourself, you know? You don't need to be at everyone's beck and call. So, then maybe we should get a drink in the new year. Now, look. I've already prepared everything. It's all here. - I know, and it looks really good. Yeah? Great. Well let's eat. I'm starving. - Tom, this is really sweet of you. And I mean that, but my whole family's expecting me. I have plans. I guess some plans are made to be broken. Do you want to say grace, or should 1? Hell, skip it. I've never been religious, anyway. Bon appetit. What do you like to do? You know, I have to work and stuff. It's hobbies. That's a mundane question, but I guess people ask that just to get... to know each other, right? I read. Right now I'm reading Hemmingway, "The Sun Also Rises". And... You really should eat. It's going to get cold. Anyway, so, in the book, this guy, he loves this girl so much... that he's willing to forgive everything that she does. Even her infidelities. That's a pretty intense story, but... that's what love is supposed to be, right? My boyfriend's going to get worried and he's going to come looking for me, Tom. If I don't show up he's going to come looking for me. He knows where I work. How long have you guys been dating or hanging out? Two years. - Two years? Do you guys live together? - It's none of your fucking business. That's not very nice dinner talk. Yeah, we live together. Ok? Two years. That's more than a boyfriend, that's a... It sounds like wedding bells. Do you guys have any plans? Yes. - What does your fiancé do? He's a journalist. - Journalist. See, I knew he had to be smart. What kind of journalist? - Sports. Sports? What paper? - "The Post". "The Post"? I read "The Post". What's his name? Mark Clayton. - Clayton? Clayton. I don't remember that name. You know, I have one over here. - It's online. It's "The Post online". You know, it is amazing that you're able to keep a relationship... with the amount of hours that you work. He must get really lonely when you have to work late, right? Do you love him? Does he love you? I'm only asking, because I'm worried about how quickly he's going to get here. I'm sure he's already on his way. Right. He's probably on the Harlem River Drive as we speak. What kind of a car does he drive? - I don't know. You don't know? You don't know what kind of car your fiancé drives? Toyota, I think. I don't know. - Toyota, what a fast car. He could be here a lot sooner than I was thinking. He could be coming down this ramp right now as we speak. You know, you haven't been very talkative since we met, but now... you're telling me all about your boyfriend. Oh, sorry, your fiancé. So either we've become best friends over dinner or you're lying to me. I'm going to guess. You're lying to me. You don't really have a boyfriend, do you? But you want one. You want somebody who cares about you, worries about you. - Please, don't. You've got a great family. You know, you've got Lorraine. And Jimmy and Rose. They love you. They're probably getting worried about you. Maybe we should give them a call. Yeah? Tell them you're ok. What do you think? But what shall we say? I know, I know. We should say you made other plans. No. You probably already said that one. You know what? You should think of something. You're a good liar. Go ahead. Go! No. Hello. Hello? Hey, Rosie. Can you get your mommy on the phone? Who's calling, please? - It's Auntie Angie. Mommy, it's Aunt Angie. Give me a second. It's Angela. Hey. Where are you? - Angela? I'm not feeling well. - What do you mean? We're all waiting for you. She says she's not feeling well. - That's what she said the last time. - Can I talk to my sister? So, where are you, Angie? Angela? I'm home. I went home. - What's wrong? Where is she? - I really don't understand. Last time I talked to you, you said you were on your way. - What about the costume? - You know what? Let's just eat. Angela, you know it would be nice if you tried to put your family... - ahead of your work sometimes. - That's enough. Give me the phone. Angie, what's wrong? Hello? I can't hear her. Hello, Sweetie. Can you hear me? - Hi, Mom. I'm here. Honey, what happened? Where are you? I don't know. I think it's the flu. - You really sound terrible. Are you sure you're ok? Honey? Yeah. I just need some rest. Ok, well, rest up and hopefully you'll feel better for lunch tomorrow. And Sweetie, don't worry about the costume. Ok? Merry Christmas, Angel. I love you. I love you, too, Mom. Hey. That's the best Christmas present anyone's ever given me. Thank you. Now, I have a present for you. Go ahead. Open it. Aren't you even curious? Come on. Open it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet you're curious now, yeah? Ok, enough torture. Watch. It's all cued up. Why are you showing this to me? - Wait. You fucked up now, asshole. Sorry you had to see that. You want to go for a stroll? These guys always do whatever they want. Here we go. Rocky, sit! Stay down. Stay still. Stay still. Give me your arm. Give it. Why? Why? Why did you do that? Rocky, shut the fuck up! Let me help you up. Don't be silly. I'm not going to hurt you, alright? You're hurting my arm. - That's because you won't relax your arm. Come on now. - Just let me go. I won't tell anyone. Oh, yeah. I believe you. I will show you something. Alright. Let's put that all behind us, yeah? Here we go. I think I drank too much wine. I shouldn't be driving. I'm just kidding. You know, I've seen you drive out of here so many times. It's strange actually being in the car with you. - It's great, actually. - You said we were taking a drive. We are. Then why are we going down, Tom? - It's freezing out there. Besides, this is going to be much better. Why are we down here, Thomas? Tom. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Tom. What is this? This is my present to you. Take this and show him. Show him what? Show him you're not a slut. Take this and teach him he can't be touching every woman that he wants. Are you talking about what happened in the elevator? Oh, Tom. No. No, no, no. You don't understand. That was a mistake. That was a stupid mistake. - What? What? He tried to rape you. No. No, he got a little out of hand at a party, Tom. He hardly tried to rape me. Look, he was drunk. He apologized. Oh, he apologized. Oh, you think you're the first woman he tried to do this to? I've seen him trying to touch every woman in the building. He's a pervert. He's a degenerate. - No. No. He's not. He's a good man, Tom. He's a good man. Just look at him. He has a family. He has a wife. Tom. Please, Tom, just... - Tom. Stop calling out my name, alright? I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to humanize yourself... like you're some poor victim. I told you. I'm not going to hurt you. Alright? Stop calling out my name, alright? Enough is enough. Tom. Tom. Tom. Every time just the same. Ok. Oh. Oh. I know you're a person, ok? I know you're a person. Ok? I'm a person, too. I know you have feelings. I have feelings, too. I care about your feelings. He's the one you should be scared of. He's the one who has no feelings. So, if you want to help him, take this and teach him a lesson. I told you. He apologized. What? He can just apologize and then he can do it again? And he's just going to apologize again. You've got to stop letting these assholes have their way with you. Tom, just please believe me. It was just a misunderstanding, Tom. Tom. Tom. Stop calling out my name. I told you. Ok. - Didn't 1? Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry, but you're scaring me. - Jesus. When are you going to understand? I'm... I'm here to help you. I'm not going to hurt you. Ok. I'll do it. You untie me and I'll do it. No, no, no. Whoa. You're a good person. - You're a good person, too. I should have never asked you to do this. I'm sorry. - No. No, it's ok. It's ok, because I want to, I just... You just have to untie me and I'll do it. For you. It's my job. It's my job to protect you. - No, Tom. Listen to me. It's not. It's not. Please don't do anything. - Don't try to run away, ok? Can I trust you? Can I trust you? -Yes. You can trust me. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. So. You like to touch girls, do you? No? No? Look at her. I said look at here. Does she look happy to you? Hm? Yeah. Yeah. You messed with the wrong girl, hm? What makes you think you deserve her? Hm? What gives you the right? You're something else, you know that? You pretentious, Ivy League, piece of shit. You don't own the world and everyone in it. I mean, what is a guy like you thinking when he puts his hands all over a girl... who obviously is not interested, who is obviously not a slut? Because that's what you think they are, right? Yeah? I can't hear you. What did you say? What? Hm? Can you speak up, because you can't talk your way out of this one, can you? Why am I even wasting my time with you? - No! What the hell? He deserves it. - Don't do anything, Thomas. Please. No! Thomas, stop it. No. Way to ruin Christmas, asshole. Well, he won't be bothering you again. - Where are we going? We can't just leave him there? - Why? Why are you defending him? I'm not. I'm not. - Why? Did you like this? Do like to get touched? Hm? You like it when he touches you in the parking garage? You want to get laid here? - No. You know that's not true. So what? What is it? Is it a career thing? Did you fuck him to get a promotion? Hm? You can't leave him here. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We shouldn't leave him here. Thomas, stop! What are you doing? - We're going to take him for a drive. What are you doing? No, Thomas. Stop the car. Stop. Please, stop. Please. Stop it. Stop it. What are you doing, Tom? No! No! No. No. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Don't do this. Please. Don't. Don't. No. Thomas, please don't do this. No. No. Thomas. No. Please, don't do this. No. No. No! Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going? Angela. Angela. Come back. You're fucking a great liar. Liar.

Is there someone with you right now? - No, he's outside. He's in the parking lot. He already killed someone else. Did you see him do it? - Yes, his name is Thomas. He's the parking attendant in my building. If you'll please hurry. I'm in danger. Ma'am, you have got to relax. - How do you fucking expect me to relax? This man is trying to kill me.

That's why I pretended to be someone else. Ok? So don't be upset. Will you come out? I was just kidding. Just go to hell. - Angela, don't you understand? I did it for you. That guy showed you no respect. Why won't you talk to me, Angela? Just give me a chance. You know, if you just give us a chance, it can work out. You'll grow to like me. You know, that's usually what happens when 2 people are forced to be together... in a stressful situation. They have to depend on one another, and eventually they support each other, and like each other. Sometimes they even fall in love. Angela. Angela, please, please don't do this. Hm? Why won't you talk to me? You know, I wish you had just a little bit more respect for yourself. I want to go out. Do you hear me? What are you doing? You fuck! No. Oh, what did he do? Karl. Karl.

No. Like I said, I was just doing my rounds and it's been real quiet. I haven't seen anybody down here. - Any cars in there? Well, it is a parking garage.
