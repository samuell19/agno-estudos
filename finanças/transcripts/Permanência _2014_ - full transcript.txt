Hello. Dick Laurent is dead. Oh, what? Ivo! Ivo, is that you? Is it open? No. Is it open now? No, not yet. Oh, yes. Now it's open. - Ivo... - Hey... Listen, do you still feel uncomfortable in elevators? No. Not anymore. COFFEE STAINS - Never mind. I'll wash later. - Not at all. - The dishtowel. - Well, thank you. - Do you want a cigarette? - No, I don't smoke anymore. Really? And it's been a long time since I decided to quit it. - Aren't you hungry? - No. Not even a fruit or something? - I don't eat in the mornings. - Ah, that's true. - And some coffee? I know you like it. - Right the way. - The old one... - Do you remember of it? - Of course. It gets even better when I swap some components on it. How was your trip? It was good. It was cold, you know. And some turbulence too, but it was fine. S?o Paulo's weather is crazy. You never know it. When the pilot said the city was 11? C... everyone was frightened. You should have brought Recife's sun with you. I couldn't... It was raining buckets in Recife. Raining buckets... I didn't brought the sun, but I brought you this... Tapioca? I can't believe it. You didn't had to... I'm glad you are here... in my house. Especially because you brought me those special things. You didn't bring any coat, did you? No. Actually no. I'm wearing two shirts right now. I'm gonna buy a coat today. I think I?m fine. There are some good thrift shops around here. I was about to ask you that. I think I have a coat that fits you well. It's too big for me. I'm gonna get it for you. It starts today? No. The opening night is on Monday. I'm going there today just to meet the space. Yeah. I'm gonna talk to Mauro. We can go on Monday. It would be great. - Come on... - Are you alone? - Yes. He's working now. -Ah, yes. - I'm not holding you back, am I? - No, it's OK. He woke up earlier because of the traffic. But at this hour of the morning, it's faster by subway. God... You coffee is still awesome. Thank you. - You... - Is this... You first. Is this coffee the italian one that your father used to bring? Yeah, exactly. He is still the same. Is he OK? - My father? - Yes? He's great. And what about yours? I don't know. It's been a while since we last talked. Does he knows that you are here? Not yet. You ain't changed a thing. You changed, of course, but not so much. And you're more beautiful. Are you sure that is a good idea I?m staying here? Make yourself comfortable. - Anything, just call me. - OK. - Bye. - Bye. The right foot it's too low, man. It's not right. We have to create space where there is no space. We have to put a... Just next week, Ms. T?nia? I can't. I'll be in Belo Horizonte next week. I can't. - Hey! - Ivo? I'm going. No, I just wanted to know if it was you. - Right. I'm leaving. - OK! We'll do it as it's on the project. Just like that. The floor plan was already approved by the government. No, man. We have to keep the wall as it's in the plan. No, man. This one we talk about when I arrive, OK? No, forget about that, man. That's just an engineer trying to disturb our work... to smooth his own work. Let's schedule a meeting. And discuss about it. Bye, I?m already going. Without me in the office, everything go nuts. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Well, Rita told me a lot of good things about you. Oh, yes? Are you OK? Everything's fine? Yes, perfectly right. - Be welcome. - Thank you. Make yourself at home. - What about the house? - Good. I'm in home theater's room. There a bunch of good movies that you can watch there. - Yeah. - Make yourself at home. I notice it. But I don't know if I would had plenty of time for movies. Rita told me about your art exposition. That you're a photographer. That's cool. Photograph is something big, isn't? You can do a lot of things. - Yeah. - Do you photograph advertising? No... I rather to work with other things. Ah, right. Advertising is not that cool. I was just catching somethings I had forgot. I'm leaving. I'm leaving now too. Where are you going? I can give you a ride. - No, I?m fine. - It's OK, man. I'm not hurry. I can give you a ride. No, really. I'd like to walk a little bit. You know how to walk in S?o Paulo? Yeah, I can get by around it. That is Rita's coat? Yeah. She borrowed me until I buy mine. Rita is really crazy. If you want, I can lend you a coat. No, I?m fine. You can keep cool. The weather here in S?o Paulo is crazy. Yesterday was a really hot day. Today is cold. Sometimes you can notice the four seasons in a day. At Recife, you don't need to wear a coat, do you? No. Not at all. Recife is a really hot city during all the year. 29? C. That hot? That's delicious. Hey, man... Here is my number. Call me if you need something. - OK, Mauro. - Bye. Hello? Hello. Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you Cristina? She's a little bit busy. Can I help you? I scheduled with her by the morning. - Are you Ivo? - Yeah. I recognized your accent. We talked by e-mail sometimes. - I'm La?s. -Ah, right. - Are you OK? - Nice to meet you, La?s. Me too. Cant you wait a minute? - All right. - Just a minute. She's on the phone. Would like some water? Coffee? No, I?m fine. Please, feel free. Anything, just call me. Thank you. Beto! -Ivo, my dear. - Hi. Are you OK? - Yeah. - Ah, it's two kisses in your city. How are you feeling? It was difficult to find the building? No, it was easy. I've arrived early today. "Early'. I love your accent. But we scheduled at 10 am, didn't we? Yeah, but I had to do a lot of things and I got late. I know how it is. S?o Paulo is crazy. That traffic disturb even us, who are used to it. Anyway. Would like to see the exhibition room? - Now? - Yeah. They missed the deadline. But that's normal. Everything is gonna be fine. I can assure you that. No, I?m fine with that, actually. It's funny to look at it in person. It seems really different from the plan. It's normal to feel like that. Just don't try to change everything in the room now, please. - No, don't worry. - I'm not. Of course we can improvise somethings. And we only will know what it is right or wrong when they finish it. But you have to trust me, Ivo. Specially because I?m used to work with new artists. I know how the things are. First exposition and things. I know it well. Everyone here is excited about your work. and I think is gonna be important for the gallery to work with someone like that, not from a big capital. That's good. I'm really excited too. That's good. Ready. Hey! So... How's been that wonderful city? - Rio de Janeiro? - Ah! Recife! Ah, it's OK. It's like it's always have been. I've been there for the Carnival. It's a wonderful city. I've fall in love with the "Old Recife". Ancient. Ancient Recife. Yeah, ancient. I always change the name. But tell me... Are you in your friend's house? Yeah, it's fine. Well, if you want a hotel room, just tell me... that I can do something. Today is gonna be a party in the house of one of our artists. Well, I just think you should have go. - Nice coat. - Really? I'll give yours back. Did you went to that thrift shop I told you? Yes, but I didn't found nothing for me. I had to go to a shop. Yes, it's easier for a women. But tell me... how was your day? It was a good one, normal. - And yours? - Normal too. I thought you were sleeping. Yeah, I always sleep late. - It was a strange, actually. - What? The day. There was a group thing today in the company. They think I?m silly, because I wasn't exciting about it. Do you think I?m silly? Just a little bit. - Aren't you working on a newspaper? - Kind of.. I'm still there, but as a freelancer. It's a double life for sure. - What is that building up there? - That one? Sometimes I see some people. Once I saw a couple sleeping in that room. So do you spy the people? Mauro's friend is reforming, actually. Really? Cool. Did you have dinner already? No. I get here quick. I'll just take a shower... and get out with some friends. Would you like to come? - No, I?m tired. You can go. - OK. I'm sorry for the hurry, but they'll wait for me. No, it's all right. Feel free. Well, I?m going. - Hey. - How it's going? Look, that's Sandro, from the Biennial. - How are you? - Hey! It reminds me of something. We were in a meeting. And we had introduced ourselves. We are with someone. And then, she... FROM ISABEL HOW IT WAS? SEND ME NEWS, KISSES. She talked about that one as if it was her best friend. - Are you kidding? - Not at all. HELLO, MY DARLING. - I was shocked. - I can imagine it. - R?mulo, come home. - Tell him to leave. I would live at S?o Paulo at this hour. Really? If there was only this hour here, I would live. - My father lives here. - Really? I didn't knew. That's why you denied our hotel room invitation. - No, it's complicated. - Why? - I can't even think about his house. - How's that? He's your father. Well, let me explain in a few words. "Cuckold". -"Cuckold"? - I'm the son of it. - What does that means? - "Cuckold"? Wait, La?s. Don't you know that word? No, I don't think so. Cheat on someone. - Oh, that. - Two-timed. - Yeah, that's regular here. His wife doesn't know who I?m. And I have a sister. She doesn't want to know me. - What an awful man your father is. - No, I don't know if he is. I'm sorry. I'm just judging your father. It's OK... I never judged him, but I never understood... his reasons. It's always hard for me to say that I?m an outside marriage son. But now I?m OK with that. I was born after a sex in a love motel. Just after a wonderful dinner. So you are the son of a irresistible passion. No, of a wonderful dinner. - No, that's called love. - Oh. That's a "democratic party" interpretation. "Democratic party" No, it's more a "Black Panther Party". Hey. What are you think? - Do you like it? - Is it yours? You can say you didn't like it. I won't be mad. Well... Do you like it? - Hey... - The montage's plan was mine. A friend from college, five minutes on this night... This night? There are two more of it around the city. Get out, girl. You got the tricks on you. So do you want to sleep with me right now, don't you. I'm kidding. I can go without sleep. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hey. Good evening, S?o Paulo. I'm sorry, man, but I?m hurry today. You can get by... - There is coffee... - OK. See you. Hey, you. Hi. - Did you like it here? - Very much. I'm Ivo. And you? It's so strange not to feel this side. Can you feel it here? Nothing? I don't know. Kind of. What happened? It's ugly, don't you think? It's not. You still beautiful. Just turn around it. Idiot. It was dentist anesthesia. It will pass until the end of the day. - We have to order up there. - They didn't come to the table. - Really? Hi. - Would you like to order? - Yes. Do you recommend something? Have you ever taken the Aeropress' coffee? - Take it. You'll like it. - She said. An Aeropress for you. And you? Nothing. I'll drink just water. You invite me for a coffee and will drink some water? I forgot about the dentist. But you can take it. This coffee is really good. She said. - Where are you both? - Up there. - I'll take it for you. - Thank you. Thanks. He told me to not to take coffee at all. - That's a bad thing. - Yeah. Well, did he knew that I was going to meet you? Son of a bitch! I have to stop with coffee too. - Why? - Gastritis symptoms. Ivo, coffee there is nothing to do with that. It's a tea industries lie. I'm glad it's. If I stop with coffee, I drop dead. Screw it. It's funny. You just arrived and I'm speaking like you. It seems there is a bottom inside my head. - May I see it? - Sure. Whose albums are these? Buelo's. Your photos are asking for more space. Aren't you thinking it is too monotony? No, actually... It's over. It's not working like this. Because I think the dynamic... The photo's dynamic is good, but... I think it needs a little air. A little more of space between them. Yes. But what if we focus the light, decreasing the general one. - What are you think? - It's not a matter of light. It's how we put it on the space. I think we have to remove one of the photos. - Remove? - Yes. It's better we clean it than... This way we're invalidating the space. Can you see it? Just trust me, Ivo. We have to clean the space. Just trust on what are I am doing. It's over now. Well, it looks like a bar code. Are you anxious about the exhibition? - Fuck yes. - I can imagine it. Can I tell you a secret about when I get anxious? This one. Take it with you. Hey, I think that in the Carnival you get dress like Laura Palmer... - Whose? - Laura Palmer. - Twin Peaks. - I heard of it, but never watched it. It was on television by the end of the 80s. Eighties? I'm from 90s, baby. So you should have been the best thing about the 90s. How was the fantasy? Hold it on. - Now you come. - What? Spinning around? - Really? - Rolling. - Like this? - Yes, don't stop. - More? - More? I'm almost home. OK. Faria Lima's station. - Thank you for today. - You're welcome. Bye. That wine in your hand... was bought in a Mendoza's winery. Oh, yes? It was in a trip last year. What a great place, man. Look, open it with kindness. It coasted U$80 dollars. Here it would coast around R$ 300 reais. - Hey, Rita. - Hi. - Put one more glass for Ivo. - There are three glasses already. Well. So let's drink here. - Hi. - Are you OK? I'm fine. A toast to the success of your Exhibition. - Well. - Yeah. - It's really good. - Well, really good. - Bouquet is awesome. - Yes. I was told that you can make a tapioca like no one else. Oh, really? Yeah... I just have an idea... Why don't you open a tapiocary here in S?o Paulo? I'm serious. I never saw it around. There are some creperies... Is that right? Tapiocary? You can do different flavours. Brie cheese with... Well, I don't have that entrepreneurial spirit. Yeah, he doesn't. - And I don't... - You don't even have to answer. Well, if I mix chess brie with tapioca they will kill me in Olinda. Mauro always wanted a restaurant. He's just passing the buck to you. Not really. I like to mix things up. It's kind of french, I think. You have a new message. First new message. Hey, darling. It's me. I couldn?t talk to you all day. Put your cellphone to charge, boy. How are the things going? There's no new message. To listen, press one. To record a message, press two. To... I wish I could be in Recife for a while. Well, let's go. - Do you remember of Ti?o, Rita? - Of course. - He just got another kid. - Second time? Another girl. How they say there... The one who has only daughters, it's an womanizer. - He stills on music? - He plays. But got a job in the government. What? Lights off. Her father told me once that if marijuana was legal Pernambuco would be a great state. It's funny. He never told me that. I'm almost trying crack cocaine... You're strong. I think there is nothing left, but you can try it. You still using film, man? It's the only way that I work. - And it works good? - Yes. It never disappointed me. Man, I goggled you... and it's your first individual exhibition? Yeah. But why just now? Hey, man... is only now that I?m working with galleries and museums. A curator saw my work... and defined it as contemporaneous and stuff. To be honest, I think of me more like a photographer than as an artist. But there is some difference? Hey, I know you, camera. What film is on it? A special one. Take a picture of us, Ivo. C'mon. - It has to be natural. - Just talk to me. - Do it as if I?m not here. - Take it easy... As if I?m not here. - Talk to me. - Say something to me. - Something? - Yeah. You're the love of my life. Just mine. Hi? Did I woke you up? Are you feeling better? No,. I don't know. I think is weird. Yeah, I?m not really liking it. I don't know. It's too serious. Yeah, she rather that way. OK, my love. Tomorrow morning I talk to you. Let's go. - Does he likes papaya? You can it. - Don't you know? - What? If he likes papaya. I don't know, Mauro. You can it. I don't think he likes it. Ivo? Hi, good morning. We're leaving, OK? There is a table out there. Coffee, bread. If you want. For anything, you have my number. We'll be back by Monday in the morning. - Get back to sleep. - I don't know if I was dreaming. If you remember about the dream, tell me. I have to go. Bye. Thank you. I was only two weeks far and it become a chaos. It's all delayed. They even got the hospital number to call me. But I was in bed. Couldn't do nothing about it. But it was a lesson for them, you know. They were almost asking me for retire before of that. But they have no one for my position. What brought you to the hospital? Things of a old man. I'm fine now. But for you... take care of your bloody pressure. It's funny. Every time I?m asked by the doctors about hypertension in the family, I say it's fine. At least in mom's side, it's OK. But on this side of the family, everyone dies of a stroke. If it's over 40 years old, you take medicine and don't eat anymore salt. I just can't control myself. That's really a heritage, Mr. Paulo. Do you remember when you told me to get some coffee with salt? - Do you remember of it? - Yeah, but I didn't swallow it. I meant you to feel the power of the salt. Salt with coffee it's not coffee. It's something else. - You should take care of yourself. - Yeah. - How's your mother? She's fine? - She's fine. - And your grandpa? - Everyone's fine. - You'll be here until when? - Tomorrow. Tonight is the opening. I wonder if you'll be there. - At night? - Yes. It's complicated for me. I'm in the other side of the town. Yeah. And I don't know what to tell to Tereza. I get it. But it'll be there for a while. You can go any day. Yes, in an afternoon when everything get calm here. - And I?ll be there to see your work. - OK. Where are you staying here? I was at Rita's. But now I?m in a hotel. - Do you remember of Rita? - Rita? - That one from the drawing. -Rita, hey! - Yeah. - Are you a couple again? Not at all. She's married now. I was visiting her as a friend. Hey, Carl?o. It's OK? Yeah. I'm just changing somethings. That's my son, Ivo. - Hey! - Nice to meet you. That thing of visiting as a friend doesn't work. Why did you back for her house? Do you remember a conversation we had about the smell? Woman's smell. Smell and conversations: two things that never change in a woman. When it changes, the death arrived. You know that the sound remains around the city. The conversation we had.. it keeps spinning around the world. It's a theory, you know. I can even hear and feel every conversation I had with Tereza. Even the moments of silence. It's so good. The silent we need. If you have nothing to say, just keep quiet. Respect that silence. And the silence it's not that noise. I don't know what else to talk with Rita. I think we've lost the subject. Ivo? - Is he there? - No. - He slept away. - No. There's no clothes anymore. Well, he finally realized. Hello? You should have told me. OK. No, I?m fine. Yeah. Right. By 3 o'clock? Yeah. There is a place you need to know. I'll send you the address. OK. Bye. And? - Were you talking with Ivo? - Yes. - It's all fine? - Yeah. I'll take him to that place that I used to go with my father. I thought you were not coming anymore. It was hard to get here. Hello. No, I?m in a movie theater. I'm going soon. No. Bye. Ivo. I have to go. Later you tell me about the movie. It's OK. It's too late for me. Here is. I need to know if it was her. - Hello. - Hey! You're the photographer. I really like it. - It was really interesting. - Really? Those photographs... Each one isolated, hidden... -Suddenly that group of people. -Exactly. It's my husband on the photo. - Really? - It's Greg?rio. It was taken in Piracicaba. The group is like this, he's the one on the right side. - The close-up... -No, the photos were taken in Recife and cities around Pernambuco. - It wasn't in Piracicaba. - Pernambuco? He never told me about Recife. Pernambuco? Well... I wish you all the best, right? Bye. I thought you weren't coming. -Hi, Mauro. - How are you? Finally, uh. - Yeah. - And you... How it is? - Yeah, is open now. - Yes. - Yeah. - That's good. I bet you saw a lot of people around it. Yeah, but I don't know. I just left the place. I'm no one yet. We need to take some pictures with you up there. Really? Now? Oh, La?s. That's Rita, a friend from old times. Are you Rita? -Nice to meet you. -Me too, La?s. That is Mauro. Nice to meet you. It's funny. I think I know you from some place. I don't remember of you. La?s is helping me with the exhibition. - Is the photos for the press? - Yes, for the press. - Let's go. - You and your photos. Well, let's go. We're going to see it. Here is your keys. - Are you leaving today? - Yes. - But I had to give you this. - What it is? I didn't know if I should give it to you or if we'd ever meet again. But I remind me of a photo that you took. I think it's here inside. Why are you giving me this? I don't know, it's a gift. You can develop it if you want. You know I?m curious. I'll do it. - Why didn't you developed it? - I don't know? I think I was gonna regret if I would do it. Now you're my partner in crime. There's a taxi waiting for me out there. My bag is there. I'm leaving. - What time does your flight leave? - At 8h10 a.m. -Congonhas or Guarulhos? -Guarulhos. Send the taxi away. I can give you a ride. You don't need to worry. It's OK. I have to go somewhere else... I'll take you there. You should start drawing again. END Subtitles: vitorf.
