Butchery Can I come in? Good evening. What brings you here? A courtesy call... lowed you a visit, really. Immacolata, you owe me lots of things. Let's be frank. I checked the accounts. I owe you 480.000 lire, but I need more time. The butcher's shop isn't making much... people aren't buying... If I'd wanted money, I'd have sent my accountant... I wouldn't have come myself. Business is good for you. You're a very resourceful woman. Remember the old days? I've finished. Will you drive me home? I've a surprise... will you come to lunch tomorrow? With pleasure... I've great faith in you. Come around at about 2 p. m and if you like bring your wife. I've asked the Pappalardos to lunch. How come? My business. I'll be right back. Is she asleep? Your daughter's an imp, but she fell asleep at last. Let her stay the night. Thanks. See you tomorrow. It's a good opportunity... she can start as a maid, then... He owns 2 butcher's shop, she could become a cashier. Immacolata I'm so grateful. Marittella is an orphan and she's unskilled. She can't live here... I've sons... Marittella! You still play the football pools? 40.000 lire a week, all up in smoke! It's a whim... if you can afford it, why not? Do you like goat? Fetch the eggplant. She can cook too? Oh yes. Marittella's a complete woman. ...fried eggplant! - I'm not hungry. - Eat up, don't be shy. Your daughter? She's gone out with Antonietta. Antonietta lives downstairs... she's crazy about my Luciella... How old is she? 8 already... doesn't time fly! Immacolata, you're just like a yo-yo. Always on the go. Finish eating. You disappoint me: we're getting nowhere. Not so fast, Don Ciro... we'll get there. Pasquale's going out... but what about your wife? She'll drop off, sooner or later. - Sugar, Donna Sisi? - No coffee for me, it ruins my digestion... I'll sit in the armchair a while. Sorry, but I've a meeting... we're getting the orders for a new job. Goodbye. Let your wife have a rest... have a smoke while we clear up. Ciro, fancy the girl, eh? Are you kidding? So it's still Immacolata, is it? The slut! Go to sleep... Marittella, come with me. You've got to be real nice to this gentleman. He can set you up. What's she crying for? Playing hard to get! Don't wake your wife! Don't be like that... don't be scared, you're a grown woman. Come here. Let's go or I'll make a scene! You say you love your daughter... then you report me to the cops! Marittella talked, not me. Turn yourself in, it's best! Get out, you slob! Let me in! Aunt Carmela, it's Immacolata! What's wrong? Sleep here, tomorrow we'll see. Immacolata! Go away, I'm innocent! Aunt Concetta! Look out! Angelina's husband came... he wants to kill you. - You were there, weren't you? - He had his knife. Is the boss in there? Call him. Excuse me, but I'm leaving earlier today. Okay, see you tomorrow. Concetta, take a bag of potatoes. Some owe: me. Coffee. Stop it! He'll have to fix that tart. Butch! I was waiting for you. I'll snatch that cock you don't have! If I catch you with my wife again, I'll kill you both! You're jealous because Angelina loves me. I keep her satisfied and you don't. DISTRICT PENITENTIARY "Dear Immacolata... you've been gone 2 months. Here in jail life hasn't changed. I'm all alone now in the cell we shared fora year. The first night without you, was hell. I kept waking up, but you weren't there. I've got over it now, but I still think of you... what are you doing? Working again? I count the days that still separate us... 3 months, 1 month, 3 weeks, 1 week. I won't sleep the last night. I'm waiting for you, my love. " Concettina, come on in... don't just stand there... Tired? Concettina, when did you get out? Half an hour ago. Been waiting long? An hour. Sit by me. Immacolata... it's been so long! I was going crazy... It's late. Another night without you. Concettina, don't... we'll find... a way out. Pasquale, come here. If your wife goes with another woman, are you a cuckold? Hard to say... Forget it. Take it out on that slut! Everyone knows she's dishonored the family. I'll kill her! I swear I will. Pasquale's looking for you. He came home then went out again. He was real sore... Let's go. Eat up... Slut, so you're back, huh? Go to bed... How long have you been going with that slut? I'm talking to you, you whore! Answer me! Don't touch me! I'm warning you: cut it out or I'll kill you! Clown, who are you giving orders to?! I'll do what I want. If you don't like it, get out. You're the one who needs me, this is my house. How are you? It's hard... I've tried 3 farms, but no one wants me. There's no workaround. Concettina, if you need money, don't be ashamed to ask me. I'm okay for now. - I'm leaving tomorrow. - Where for? To work on a farm near Sessa, but it's only for a week. Concettina, another week apart? I've got plenty of chickens and eggs. I'd rather sell them to you than to others. Have a nice hot "tarallo"... while I get you a liqueur. Drink it. - Aunt Carmela, what about you? - It's bad for me. When you were little, you had blond curls... I adored you. My children were all boys... I cradled you for hours. You loved cottage cheese. I'd spread it on bread for you but you'd only eat the cheese. Aunt Carmela, tell me what you had to say to me. Immacolata, these are bad times, I can't make things out anymore. They even came here and took it out on me. Not just one, but four of them! They gossip in the village, they're wicked! I don't listen to them, I love you just the same. I'm an old woman... I don't want to know. Don't cry, eat your tarallo. Come on, the bed's ready. Antonietta told me a fairy-tale... you never do. Get into bed and I'll tell you a fairy-tale. Once upon a time there was a king... who had 3 sons but one day his eye got sick and the doctor said he could only cure it with a griffin's feather. What's that? A magic bird. The king told his sons: "Whoever finds it will have my crown". The sons set off. The youngest met an old man who gave him some seeds: “When the birds come pecking, grab the middle one, and pluck a feather from it... The youngest son did that, but on the way home, his brothers took the feather and killed him. Hold on... If you're hungry, there's some soup. Get out of the way. Was that Dad? He doesn't feel well, he's gone to bed. His brothers killed him... So the king's eye got better. Then a shepherd found a bone but as he put it in his mouth, it said: "Hold me tight and don't let me go. My brother betrayed me for a griffin's feather. " The shepherd passed by the King's house, and the King wanted to put the bone in his mouth too. “Hold me tight and don't let me go", said the bone, "My brother betrayed me for a griffin's feather. " - You, here? - I saw the car... Out at this time of night? Concetta, I feel lousy... I can't take any more. - You're back early? - Yes, last night... Coffee? Immacolata, don't cry... I can't take any more. Concetta... I've thought it over. Hold on a second... Concettina, there's only one way out. Move in with me. If my husband doesn't like it, he can get out. Do it today, Concetta, today. Is Immacolata in? Yes. Immacolata, you're wanted! Help us take the luggage in. Immacolata... It's like a dream... you and me together. I love you. I don't care what people say... I want to be with you. I'm happy with you. Are you 7? I'm happy... so happy I could die. Immacolata, your daughter! She fell! Luciella... - The ambulance is coming. - What a bad fall... Luciella, what did they do to you! Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me! Immacolata, you haven't slept for 3 nights. Antonietta can stay tonight, you need a rest. I can't leave her. You must, at least for one night. I'll go to the sanctuary. The Holy Virgin will help me. Last night I dreamt I was standing on a high cliff... above a stormy sea. In front there was another cliff with grass and trees. Luciella was running. I called her but no words came. It went on forever. Then it was summer. We were making tomato sauce. Luciella was sitting in front of me, laughing... she went on and on. It's bad luck, laughter in dreams. Are you sick? Don't worry... I'm okay. Where's Antonietta 7 "minimum runs. The girl wants you. Luciella, so you're back... at last. Good evening. I've come just in time. Good evening, what brings you here? Surprised? I heard about the accident. How is the girl? I'm resigned to it now. Can't something be done? I'm taking her to a special school... but there's no hope. Immacolata, if you need any help... I'm at your disposal. You're too kind. Will you allow a toast? You must be joking. I'm glad you agreed to come tonight. Can I hope we'll resume our friendship? You know I don't mince words. M“ “win-w. I did a year in jail. That time... we were both too hasty, but mostly you. You didn't foresee how the girl's relatives would react. My wife got jealous, not over her... but over you, Immacolata. Another bottle. How's business? Great: I've opened a third butcher's shop. I'm into wholesale too, now. I've got an office, my headquarters. We must do business again, I'm ready to help you. If your butcher's shop is still doing badly, we've got to do something. Where's the bathroom? On the left. Whisky q Is it true... you're going with a woman, Concetta, you met in jail? Ciro, I don't want to talk about it. Why not? I already said I don't want to! - Where were you? - I told you on the phone. Out to dinner with a friend. Then where? Which friend? None of your business. It is though, tell me! Don't shout, you'll wake the girl. So what, it's you I care about... I waited for you all evening. I kept thinking, "she's coming... she stopped to talk to an old acquaintance, she'll come soon... Who where you with 7 Leave me alone, let me cry! You went with a man, right? You don't love me any more! That's not true, I do love you. I went with a man but it's you I love. You don't love me any more! It's not a hospital, it's a school. They study, eat and sleep here, they get check-ups... gymnastics, massages... - You have to pay? - Sure. I'll do anything for her sake. They're not very hopeful, except for a slight improvement. There... What a pretty girl. Antonietta's coming too. Name; Wait for us downstairs with Antonietta. The receipt. Don Ciro says he'll come at 8:30, as usual. I'm getting used to you. What I mean is... it's not just a flash in the pan that's soon over. With you it's something peaceful, with no worries... it's there... get it? Don't get ideas, you're married and I'm through with husbands. How about this... work for me. My new butcher's shop isn't doing well... as well as I want. Take it over, do what you like. We split the profit 50-50. Okay? I'll give you a contract. It's a good chance for you. I should give up my shop, though it stinks... and when you're through with me, start over again?! What guarantee have I got? I want to be independent. Independent and stone broke, for what you make out of it. But I'm my own boss. Think it over, work it out. Not asleep? Concettina, not tonight. Why not? I can still feel his cock burning. Where are you? - Why all the parcels? - Present for you. What are we celebrating? I went to see Luciella. She looks well good and fatter. She says hello. Like it? Hope it fits. Go on, try it on. Simple but stylish. You're beautiful, Concettina! ...the shoes too. Like them? You must have spent a lot. Let's look at you. Come here. Pappalardo is given me 50% of a butcher's shop in Naples. I'm going to run it. You'll work with me and quit this lousy life. Are you kidding? I've no experience. What's the use in me coming? You'll help me and be near me. Come in... It's the second test. - How late are you? - 10 weeks. I don't get you, what's biting you? You're so quiet tonight. Say something, can't you? Tell me! Ciro, I'm pregnant. I've seen the doctor, I want an abortion. Pregnant... Will My Child! You're expecting my baby and you want an abortion? You're crazy! I want the best doctors, the best hospital! My son... my first... and you want an abortion? You're crazy! You've got to give me this child. You've got to! Is that clear? I want the kid! Not eating? I'm not hungry. I want to tell you... I'm pregnant. I knew it wouldn't last. What do you mean?! I don't want the kid! I'd rather kill myself! Help me... kick me in the stomach till I get rid of it! When I sleep with you... I keep thinking of a man. But when I sleep with a man, I always think of you. It's like a fire rising from my stomach to my head. You, here? You're soaked... your hair too. Tomorrow we'll go see Luciella and take her to the movies.
