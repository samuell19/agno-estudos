I live at 10, Am Brunnen with my mother. We're divorced. He was filled with love And full of trust And warmth was within him And he had much time So he built a pair of giant wings And everything within him Was vast, wide open Vast, wide open... Papa! - Oh, it's you? Okay, come in. Sit down, then! Has anything happened? - No, 1 just wanked to visit you. Shouldn't you be at school? 1 mean... you should be at school. Swimming was cancelled, 50 we have a free period. Well sit down, anyway. - I'm sitting! Ah, of course. Hey, a visitor! Yes, this is my son Mathias. 1 didn't know you had such a big boy. - This is my colleague, Miss Sandke. How old are you? What's wrong with you? Nothing! Why should anything be wrong? 1 have a son too. He's still at kindergarten, though. Do you want some cake? - I've got to go now. Erika, see if there's some cake left. So how are you doing? Oh, pretty good. And how's school? - Fine. I'm busy right now. Last week I was at a mine. They tore down 2 village because there was coal under it. We need it, of course. The people had to leave their homes and move into tower blocks in the next town. Then the diggers came and... now the village doesn't exist anymore. 1 haven't got the photos yet, buk when 1 get them... you'll have to take a look. You're not interested, are you? - Sure, I am. There's no cake left. There must be! I know I bought some! I looked everywhere. - In the cupboard? Yes, there too. I don't get it, I bought some! What time is it? - What's the time, Erika? Nine thirty. Nine thirty. - I have to go now. Who is that? - What? That's a boy. His name is Icarus. Don't you know the story? - No. A very long time ago there was... a clever master builder who was vain and jealous of his art. And there was a boy who learned so much from him that he was more skilful, so he... decided to get rid of him, and the boy had to flee. He ended up in Crete, where he met the king, who offered him safe haven. It's called 'asylum', And he had to build for the king. He invented the labyrinth. You know what it is? Yes, you can't find your way out. - Right. After many years on the island, he wanted to leave. But the king wouldn't let him. So the young man said, "1 can't escape on the water..." "nor over land, s0 I'll have to fly through the air" Heinz, come here a second! I'll be right there. Anyway... he made himself some wings out of bird feathers. And he strapped them on... and sure enough, when he moved his arms like a bird, he flew up from the ground. He had a son whose name was Icarus, and he made wings for him too. But before they flew away he said to the boy, "Be sure you don't fly too low." If you do, the wings will get wet, then they'll be too heavy and you'll drown. But don't fly too high, either. "Otherwise the sun will burn your wings and you'll fall to earth." So the two of them flew off in secret. It all went to plan. But as they were flying through the air... the boy soared higher and higher. And the sun burned his wings. Or melted them, I can't remember exactly. In any case, the boy fell to earth and drowned in the sea. And his father was very sad. But why did he fly so high? He didn't need to fly so high! Yes, that's right. But you know, he felt so good. Being able to fly like a bird... being able to go wherever he wanted. Being totally free. T want to fly. I'd love to fly one day. - Yeah? Okay then, we'll take a flight. A scenic flight. When? It's difficult right now, but let me see... On your birthday! And so you don't forget, you can take the picture. And keep your chin up, okay? - Okay! I want to be a bird And fly over your city And over the green earth I'm fed up with walking I dream of beautiful wings I'm flying! I can see Africal And Americal And the whole wide world! I want to be light and free! Then I wouldn't be heavy at all I would fit inside my hand 1 can see the trees, the villages and the cities! I'm flying! I can see the cars! Tm flying! 1 can see the animal park and pot-bellied pigs! My nest would be in the cherry tree Right next to our house I'd fly right up to outer space With my white mouse I'm flying higher and higher! I'm flying further and further! I'm flying! I'd peck the crumbs From my mother's hand She'd have lovely flowers That father found for her I want to be a bird! Mama! Papa! You should be going. - Sure. In a moment. Off you go! Wake up, birthday boy! Mama wishes you a happy birthday. I hope you have a lovely time, and don't cause me any sorrow. Are you pleased? Uncle Jochen dropped off the soldiers for you. Last night. We'll have a proper party on Saturday. Then we'll have more time to play. Who is allowed to come? - Who do you want to invite? Michael and JÃ©rg. It's a pity... - What is? You know what I mean. No, I really don't know. What's a pity? That Kater can't come. I told you: if you play with fire in the flat again, Kater can't come here anymore. Imagine what could have happened! We didn't want to, but there was a metal tray near the oven 50 we thought it was okay. That's what you always think, but then an accident happens. The flat could burn down, with you inside! We won't do it again, I promise you. I hoped you've learned your lesson. So can he come? Okay, just this once. You'll have to invite Uncle Jochen too. What about Papa? Papa won't come. Papa is too busy right now. He's always travelling. Papa isn't allowed to come because of that new man! The nasty way you speak about Uncle Jochen... 1 think it's really rude of you. Think about how you speak! Stop! Where are going, may I ask? Outside. - Ah, outside? Don't you have lessons? Ms Weiss is sick, so we could leave early. - Oh? Ms Weiss is sick? Do you go home, or are you in day care? Well? Speak up! At home, or in day care? Well... I'm actually... I'm actually in day care... - Ah-ha! But it's my birthday today and my father promised to take me on a scenic flight. A real scenic flight for my birthday! - Oh, it's your birthday? Well, congratulations. - Thank you. Come with me a moment. I can't! My father's waiting! - It won't take long. My father said... - I'm sure he wrote a note for you. If everything's in order you can go. What's the matter? Oh, he's waiting outside? Switchboard here. - Can I have 315, please? One moment. There's no answer. But he... With whom did you wish to speak? - My papal Who is your papa? - Mr Wagner. Should he be here today? Yes. I think so. Hello? - Yes? There's no one on the other line either. Try again later. But he must be there! I'll put you through again. Me and my friend have a den on the roof. It's so well hidden that no one's discovered it. You can see the whole city from here: Where I live now, and our old house too. But they tore it down and there's a tower block there now. And that's where Papa lives. Next door is the supermarket. Once, when I was looking for Papa, T went into the supermarket and as 1 was pushing the trolley we crashed into each other, He didn't recognize me and was about to start moaning, but then we both started laughing. Hey, you're smoking! Yes, I'm smoking. Papal - 1 brought you something. You don't have a Caravelle yet. Well, how was it? What do you mean? Your business trip, of course. God, it was pretty exhausting. I can imagine. What's your problem? I called the editor's office. - Ursula! T know what I'm talking about. Ursula, it's a misunderstanding! I've had enough. I've had enough! All your secret games... - Think of the boy! Turn this rubbish off! Mathias! Hello. - I want to see my papa. What's his name? - Wagner. Wagner, BZ, evening edition. No, young man. There's no one there, I'm sorry. Can't you call again? - I told you no one's there! Say, aren't you Heinz's boy? I'll take him up with me. - But he's not there! I'll go and look for him. - For who? Heinz. His son is here. - Heinz is on business. - What? Wait! We'll sort it out. We can talk to you like a grown up. You're big boy now. These things happen, it's not unusual. It happened to other kids in your class too, right? Yes. Udo Stemmler, Sigrid Meyer. And Marit too. - You see? The important thing now is that you help Mama. You're a big boy. And you do love Mama, right? You'll understand better when you're a grown man. And things won't change much, anyway. Well, they'll change a bit for us. But there's no bad feelings. Mama and 1 have sat down and talked it through very calmly. And we'll see each other regularly. We won't be at other ends of the world. Oh, pardon me. Did your father know you were coming today? Did you arrange to meet up? Yes, we were going flying today. Ah, flying. I don't get it. Come with me. He had to go out on a job. He's over there, where the crane is. Hottke, 1 sent you two R-12s. 1 can't send anymore before lunch. Qver, Damn! We won't get far with that. We need a dozen of them. I'll get lynched! Over. I'll do what I can, but I can't pull them out of my pocket. And another thing: Is that journalist still there? He's the last thing I need here. What does he want? Over. There's someone to see him. See if he's there. Over. He's going to check. He's angry, isn't he? Oh, it's not so bad. He's like that every day. He's a decent fellow. How high is it? 43 metres. And how much does it weigh? It depends. Up to five tons. You know how much a ton is? - Yes, 1000 kilos. That's right. 1000 kilos. Fischer, he's not here anymore. He's not there anymore. But he must be! They said he was there! - But he's probably left. That would be really annoying. What's the hurry? - We wanted to do something together. Something important? - Really important! Hotte, it's really important. Maybe he's in the hut. Send someone to look. Over, Okay, will do. Over. - He'll send someone to look. Go, go! Fischer! Come in! Want to try? Press here, then speak. - Papa! Papa! Fischer! What's going on? Fischer! Come in! Fischer, come in! - Give it here. What's up? - If we don't get any materials, we're screwed. How can we work without materials? It bugs me. It bugs us all. Fischer, I mean it! Come over here! The journalist just left. Over. I'm coming, Hotte. Out. He's left. But you can come over. Want to? - Has he been gone long? No, he just left. He must have gone home. We're going flying, because it's my birthday! Hello. - Hello. Who are you looking for? - Mr Wagner. He isn't home. He's not home. - Can you give him a message? - Sure. I'm his wife. We're divorced. What shall I tell him? - Could you tell him that he has to call me at the office? It's about our son. - I'll tell him when he gets home. When he gets here. - That's nice of you. Thanks. You're so selfish! The plate was for Mathias. You twist things to suit yourself! Then take it, and sit on it! You have no conscience! Calm down! Mathias! What's all this? We don't have time for playing. But I want to take it! - These are Papa's things and they're staying here. Papa said I can have them when I'm big. When you're big. There's a while to go, huh? But when we move away... The things won't run away. Nor will Papa. He told you himself: He's not at the other end of the world. 1 don't wank to move away. Please, Mama! - Come on, Mathias! I want to stay here. This is my room! My God, Mathias! Do you have to make such a fuss now? Your new room is much bigger. And much nicer, And the new school... When we painted the stripes on the walls, you told me that this is the best room in Berlin. Now we have to leave Kater and everyone! You'll find new friends. The mattress too, Ursula? - Yes, that too. Get off, young man. Mathias, you're not in your place. Why aren't you sitting next to Jiirgen? I'm not sitting next to that idiot. Quiet! Calm down, now! Why are you making such a fuss? Mathias will get used to us. So, Egon, start reading. "Whol am and what I want to be". I'm Egon Karlowski and I live at 12, Christinenstrasse. We are three children. I'm the eldest. My mother studied housekeeping, now she works part time in an office. My father works for the authorities. I'd like to be a taxi driver, because you get to see a lot and you earn money too. My brothers and sisters wouldn't have to pay. I'd really like to own a new Volga. They go 140 km/h My father owns a Trabant, but it only goes 100 km/h. Tatras are faster, and Western cars go even faster than that. But they have capitalism over there. Very good! Mathias, will you come to the front? "Who 1 am and what 1 want to be'. My name is Mathias Wagner,." My name comes from my grandpa. His name was Mathias-Johannes. My grandpa died in the war, He fought with the Fascists, but he didn't want to. I used to want to be a cosmonaut. But you can only do that in the Soviet Union. 1 want to be a pilot now. 1have an aeroplane collection. Very good, Mathias. But why didn't you write about your parents? - 1 did! My mother is a brigadier, and my father... works at the newspaper and writes about everything that happens. My father used to pick me up from the kindergarten. He can tell really good stories, especially about aeroplanes. My father promised that we'd take a scenic flight for my birthday. We always bring flowers when we collect Mama from work. My parents never argue, and when my father gets home from work in the summer break, we go on holiday together. In the summer break, we go on holiday together. Hello. - Hello, Jochen. Want to take that off? So, you're Mathias? Hello. - Hello. This is Mr Keller. You can call him Jochen. Right, Jochen? Of course. Mr Keller is a fitter. He sets up the machines 50 we can work properly. Right? Yes, more or less. There are 12 machines in the hall, and two more are being prepared. But they're automatic. You need to be qualified to work on them. Would you like some more wine? Mathias, you're not eating! Eat something. I'm not hungry, Mama dear. Mr Keller plays football. We can go too, if you like. When's your next game? - Tdon't know. We played FC Turbine last Sunday. I looked really dumb when I missed a penalty. I don't know what it was, I had command of the ball. Maybe I should have leaned into it more. Yes, I should have leaned into it. If you lean backwards... the ball flies upwards. But if you lean forwards... it stays on the ground. You see? I converted a penalty once. It was in Freienwalde. It went straight into the net. Now I realize I should have leaned into it. Do you want to play too? You could join a club. I can sign you up, if you like. I know the guys in the school team. - How about it, Mathias? That won't be necessary. My papa was in the football club too. He's going to take me along. I see. I didn't know that. Mathias! Yes. My papa, you know? He's on an important business trip right now. He's writing an important article for the paper. He has to travel a lot. But he said that when he gets back he'll take me to his football club. Mathias! What on earth are you talking about? Can I give you a light, Uncle Jochen? Mathias, put the matches down! Put those matches down! He's old enough. - Him? Old enough? You can see how old he is. Whenever 1 get home there's something broken,. Recently it was the TV. And he's always playing with fire! He and Kater almost burned down the flat. I didn't break the TV. And it's unfair to keep mentioning the fire. And the thing with Kater too, he's my best friend! You're always bringing it up, it's so unfair! Kater is my best friend. His real name is Dieter Hinz, but we all call him Kater. Kater has eight siblings. He's Catholic. He gets support from the church, but he has to pray in return. Kater took me along once, we had to kneel down. Going to church makes your knees hurt. Kater is with the pioneers. Kater's mother said, "If the others join the pioneers, then Kater has to as well." Kater sleeps with Sabine and Katja. They're twins, and Kater's father says Sabine will make a good housewife. She can hang the washing with one eye and find the pegs with the other. Then everyone laughs. Except Sabine. When Kater's father says that, he's in a good mood. He's actually strict. Except on Fridays when he comes home from work. He goes out on a Friday. Kater said he once stayed out all night. And Kater's mother made a scene because of Aunt Gerda. She stayed out all night too. Kater's mother isn't as strict as his father, But when he goes out, she's stricter than him. Hey, Kater! Look over there! He's stealing it. Why? He pinched something before, too. - Him? Look! He really did steal it. - I know! He's spotted us! What shall we do? - Follow him. They should speed up! What do you think he's doing? He doesn't live there. Maybe he's selling it there. - He can't sell schnapps in the house. Mama said she can understand if people steal bread and stuff, but schnapps and cigarettes... If you steal a loaf or a roll at the bakers and get caught, they can't do anything. It's called "food theft". But shouldn't we call the police? Let's wait and see what he does. Konrad Sandberg once stood at the zebra crossing and wrote down the numbers of all the cars that just went across. Then he sent it to the newspaper and they printed the list. Mr Seiler said it was a good deed. Don't talk about Sandberg! Claudia Kolwe brought chewing gum stickers to school. She showed the others, and the teacher told her to bring it to the front. But she hid it under the bench and said "I don't have any". So she had to bring her folder up, but there was none in there either, Then Sandberg said that Claudia had thrown it under the bench. And she got a black mark for lying. Sandberg is a snitch! There he is! Come on! - Oh, forget it. He's legging it! We can't prove anything. He'll just say he had the bottle before. How do you expect to prove anything? My uncle Walter is a drinker too. Mama said that he's unbearable without his schnapps. And when he gets drunk he always cries. At my sister's communion I drank some liqueur. It makes you really dizzy. - I had sparkling wine on my birthday. Maybe he can't help it. - Maybe. My Aunt Hedwig Says to me daily Watch out for the Man in Black Because she can't get one herself What are you collecting? - We're from the school. Do you have any bottles or paper? - We're collecting for Vietnam. And Uncle Ottokar He always drinks vodka And whenever he gets drunk... He always wants people to kiss him! Do you have any bottles or waste paper? I'm collecting too. Our Miss Grieda Is much more nice Than Klein, the maths teacher She is pretty, and he is mean When people are in love and the love goes, then all they do is argue. Then they divorce. No, they only divorce if another man or woman comes along. But if the man has to go on business trips and is always away, and the wife always has to go to meetings and work, then they don't see each other enough. Like your father? No, I mean in general. She used to sit there, gazing into space. And if 1 asked her something, she'd say, "What do you want?" She pretended she didn't hear, but she did hear. But when I stopped asking, she'd answer. But nowadays it's different. When she comes home she gets changed and paints her face. My sister paints her face too. She fancies the Greek man next door. Your mama's in love too. - You're nuts! She is in love! - With who? She is in love! - Tell me who with! She is in love. You know who he is! Him? No, not him. I have to go. - Come with me. I'm going flying. 1 can't, Who are you going with? - My papa. On a scenic flight. Is your papa up there? - No, but I'm sure he's at the airfield. What if he's not there? - He will be. He promised. Tcan't. - Come on! You can fly too. CENTRAL AIRPORT BERLIN He was filled with love And full of trust And warmth was within him And he had much time So he built a pair of giant wings And everything within him Was vast, wide open Vast, wide open... STOP! AIRPORT RESTRICTED AREA And in the end he was able to fly The earth remained far below him! Until they took his warmth And deceived him... Now tell me. What were you thinking of? You must have had a reason! You can't just run across the runway! What's your name? And where do you live? What school do you go to? So, you're mute as well? Now, make a statement! Yes. 3607. Alright. Yes, he's here. Yes, shall I... Shall I write a report ...? Alright. No, I haven't managed yet. Very well, I'll see to it. Show me your pioneer's card. Then come here and show me what's in your pockets. Is that everything? The top pockets too. You can sit down again. Now tell me your name! What did you do after you left school? I went to the Berolina, where the doors open and close on their own. But you didn't just go to the hotel. You went somewhere else. Well? - In the department store. Yes. And what did you do there? T went upstairs to the TVs and looked at them. T want you to speak louder and to look at the others. T went upstairs to the TVs and looked at them. When you stand in front of them you can see both sides. Where else did you go? To the toy department on the second floor. What did you do in the toy department? I looked at the toys. The whole time? - No. And sometimes you bought things? - Yes. But not always, am I right? - Yes. Now tell the others what you did. I took it. What? - The rope. Why? Don't you have a rope? - Yes. Two. So, you ran away when the cashier saw you. And what did you do then? 1 took the subway train, and walked around. Speak louder! I took the subway train, thenT... And look at the others! And I walked around afterwards. And when it got dark my mama picked me up from the police station. You were picked up, weren't you? Yes. - You didn't go to day care, you didn't do any school work, and then you got picked up. What have you got to say for yourself? You must have something to say! You can't simply take things that don't belong to you! Look at the others. You can't skip day care and hang around until you're picked up by the police. And then not even know why! Thomas! I'd like you to make a statement! Fine, we can do this differently. Come along. Here. Why are you here? - Oh, nothing. And you? T lost my key. I can't get into my house. My father will beat me. Just because of a key? It's the second time. My father said if I lose that one he'll thrash me until I can't sit down. Now they're trying to get a locksmith. And you? I was at the airport and they caught me. The airport? Why? - I wanted to fly. Fly? Just like that? - Yes. So, did you? - Sure. 1 did a scenic flight with my papa. It was crazy, I tell you. And that's why you're here? - No. Not for that. T wouldn't give them my name. - But you have to. I can't. I skipped day care. And then being caught by the police... Good god! You can see through here. - Through the mirror? Come here. They use it to spy on people. Will it take much longer? A person could rot in here. I've been waiting over an hour. If I'm not home by four, my mama will be there and I'll be in big trouble. Why? Is she strict? No, not strict. But she's sad. Okay, come along. Sit down. Such a big boy, and so afraid. I'm not afraid. - Of course you are. Why should I be afraid? That's the thing. I don't get it either. T used to be afraid too. Of maths. When our teacher came up the stairs we'd start to tremble. "Kunze, come to the front of the class!" That's my name: Kunze. He only gave out 4s and 5s. The best pupil only got a 3. Imagine it! What's your score in maths? A two. Two? That's fantastic. I was afraid another time too. In the war, when the Red Army liberated Berlin. Heard of it? - Yes, in local history. You see! It was quite something. The bomber planes came, flying just above the rooftops. And they had machine guns. We were playing outside, then they came again and dropped bombs... And we ran and ran... Tanks came from right and left, and again the bombers flew low... firing their guns. And we ran! We shouted and cried. And 1 can tell you, son, 1was really afraid then,. Yes, I was about your age. 7or8.. No Iwas7. T would've been afraid too if I were 7. Are you older? - I'm 9. I'm 9 today. Oh, it's your birthday? Oh, my congratulations! Nine years old... you're almost a man. No need to be afraid, then. You were a bit afraid, right? - Yes, a bit. There's no need. Do I look like I'd eat you alive? No. Are you a policeman too? - Yes. Even as a kid 1 wanted to join the crime unit, What about you? 1 want to be a pilot. - Apllo? That's fantastic! But you can't be afraid in that job. It's 2:35. Are you in a hurry? - Yes. Damn! It's a real pain! Why? I can see you're an honest guy, and I'd love to let you go home. I'll get in trouble if I'm not home by 3. That's the paint. I could let you go, you'd get there on time and wouldn't get into trouble. But I'll get it in the neck. You? - Yes. Well, think about it... They bring you to me and say, "He can't go home until he tells you his name", "When he does, he can go." "You'll bring him round, comrade Kunze." And if I let you go, I still won't know your name... and I'll be in big trouble. My name's Wagner. Mathias Wagner. I live at 10, Am Brunnen. It's good that you told me that. So can I go now? - Sure., We can give you a lift. T ordered a car just for you. It's just outside the door. - But I don't want a lift! Okay, then we can walk. It's not very far. We even have time for an ice cream. I'll treat you for your birthday. The story about Daedalus and Icarus isn't true. No stories are. They're only written 50 that children behave and do everything adults want. That's why is says Icarus didn't listen to his father, and that's why he fell. But it's not true. Actually it was like this: When Daedalus finally had his wings, he only cared about what he wanted to build, 50 he could escape quickly. So he flew and flew but Icarus couldn't keep up because he wasn't as strong and his wings were much smaller. And Icarus flew so high because he thought he'd be faster in a dive, and that he'd catch up to his father that way. But he was wrong, and he hit the sun and fell down. And Daedalus didn't even realize, because he'd forgotten his son. Open up! Open the door! Here you are at last! Where were you? You have a visitor. - The police? - What? For me? But it's your birthday! - It doesn't matter. That's very sweet of you. Papa! - My boy! Congratulations. Happy birthday! Be good and work hard... and stay healthy. Health is the most important thing in life. And I hope that all your dreams come true. It's my birthday today, Papa. Why do you think Papa's here? - Yes, sure. Did... did you... He wants to know if you brought him a present, right, Mathias? Yes. Take a look around. You'll be amazed. He'll be totally amazed. Come here. Are you pleased? - Of course he's pleased! Don't you want any milk? - No, thanks. So what was that about the police? Police? - Isn't that what you said before? The police? Why? Would you like some more coffee? Thanks. So how are you doing? Oh, fine, - Everything's working out, huh? Yes, I guess so. And for you? Oh, same old thing. Yesterday they struck out two of seven pages. T ask myself how they expect us to say anything. If it's meant to be seven pages, you can't say it in five. If I were running the paper... We can't make papers the way we did 20 years ago. It's totally boring. Sure, there are exceptions, but who actually reads these days? Television is much better at conveying the flood of information. In our department... the workers have agreed 1022.5% counter-plan. But Seifert is against it. He's our chief technologist. The one with the receding hairline, 1 pointed him out once. Oh, yes. But if I were running the paper... I'd give it a totally new layout. More expansive, more modern. So you'd want to read it, you'd have to read it. A column. One, two columns a week. With a personal opinion, a personal view on things. And a decent interview... Can I go downstairs? Why? Don't you want to play with your new train set? I just wanted to go down. But Mathias! You have guests here. Oh let him. It's his birthday after all. Hello, Mathias. - Hello. Happy birthday. - Thanks. And thanks for the soldiers. And thanks for the soldiers. Do you like them? - Yes. But it wasn't necessary. What's that plane? I built it. I'm going to try it out. That's supposed to fly on its own? There's no way it'll ever fly on its own! It won't fly! It can't fly! I knew it wouldn't fly! It doesn't work, it just doesn't work! I knew all along it wouldn't fly! Stop whining! We'll just try again tomorrow. Put this on. It's cold. Put the goggles on. Your eyes water easily. So he fell down Crashed and was broken He who says he never flew is lying So carry his broken wings behind him And make sure that he may fly One more time One more time...
