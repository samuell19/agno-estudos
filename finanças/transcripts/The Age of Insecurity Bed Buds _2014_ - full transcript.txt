(calming classical music) - Bro you awake? - What time is it? - I don't know. I need an advil. - You pick up last night? - Obviously not bro, I'm in bed with you. - That's true. - Actually now that you mention it, there was some broad that came up to me in the club. - Yeah? - She wanted me to meet her friend. - And? - And it turns out her friend was a fucking guy. Bro was like twice the size of me. - That's fucking weird. - Yeah I was like what the fuck, man? I don't want to meet your big juiced out fucking friend. Does it look like I'm into that shit? I was gonna knock his fucking teeth in. - What happened? What did you do? - Guy bought me like six drinks. Turns out he owns his own hair salon. He's going to get me like free product and shit. Yeah, he's a real fucking nice guy. - That's fucking sweet, bud. - Yeah. - Hey, bro you know you're on my side, right? - What? - You're sleeping on my side of the bed, I usually sleep there. - It's the morning. I'm not moving. - Come on bro it's my bed, like just switch with me, it feels weird, come on. - That's fucking ridiculous. - Come on bro let's just switch. - Okay. (sheets ruffling) - Watch my cock, bro. Oh watch my cock, bro, fuck. - Actually, I was talking to a broad last night at the bar. - Oh yeah? - She was fucking hot too. I walked right up to her, she looked down and said "your pants are too tight." - What? - Yeah. I told her "this is the fucking style, it's fashion." - Exactly. My mom said the exact same shit to me the other week. - I bought those pants at Zara, alright? The guy who worked there, he looks me right in the eye when I had them on and said, "I'd fuck you." I'm not paraphrasing, he told me that. He's a trained fashion consultant. So I'm pretty sure that he knows this shit. - Yeah. You know what the problem is though bro, you gotta be like at least below ten percent body fat to dress the way we dress. - Ten percent? What are you, Mr. Olympus? - Oh what are you saying, I'm not below ten percent body fat, bro? Bro feel my stomach. Go. - Alright. Get the fuck out of here, you're pushing 13, 14 percent - OH yeah yeah yeah, let's feel yours I'm fucking way more ripped than you. Get the fuck out of here - Hey, you know I'm ticklish, back the fuck up. - Speaking of being ripped, bro, I was at the Gym the other day, who was that weird guy? He's always really touchy with us, what's his name? - Yeah, yeah. You're thinking about the guy with those monster traps. - No no. This guy's got like big juiced out glutes. - No no no no, this guy has obliques like a statue. - No no no, he's got like, that's his chest, man it's like fucking huge and pops out, it's like really ripped down the side. - Nah nah you're talking about the guy with the hamstrings like Birjoo? - Yeah yeah yeah, him. - Yeah. - So I was at the gym, right? And the guy practically begs to be my spotter. Begs - Wanted to be your spotter? - Yeah, yeah. So I'm doing bench, right? And it's like my second or third set, and I feel what may or may not have been his dick slapping my forehead while I'm doing bench. - His cock? - Yeah. - That's fucking weird. - Yeah, I was going to fucking knock his head off. But then I realized it might just be his iPod. So I kind of just kept doing - Oh, okay. - my workout. I finished the set and like... - That's right. It must've been his iPod, not his dick. - Yeah. - Probably an iPod makes more sense. - Yeah... - What did it feel like? What kind of iPod? Like a classic? Shuffle? - What's the one that's like thinner and it's more short than long? - The thin one, uh, the small one's the Nano. - Yeah yeah yeah the Nano, it was definitely the Nano, it was definitely an iPod Nano. - That's definitely the Nano. Those Nanos though, they're fucking useless. Not like those classics, their thick, they're heavy, - Oh yeah. - they feel terrific in the palm. - Yeah yeah yeah, definitely bro. Go classic or go home, right? - Fucking right, bud. - Yeah. Hey, do I got morning breath, bro? - I didn't smell nothing. Come in closer. (breathes) That's fucking bad, you gotta brush those teeth. - Fuck. - Whatcha doing tonight? - I got no plans, bro, you? - That Zac Efron came out last week. Let's go see it. - Who's going? - I messaged DeMarco and DeFrazza but ... They didn't get back to me so you and me. - Just me and you? - Yeah. - Like just us two? - Yeah. - At the movies? - Yeah, why? - That's fucking gay, bro. - You want some breakfast? - I'm dying for some fucking frittata, bro. - I'll make the espresso.
