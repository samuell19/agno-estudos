I was just kidding. ﻿Give me that. I’ll click. ﻿Look that way. ﻿You want to be a Director.

What’s it called? ﻿‘Malli Osari’ (Yet again) ﻿So, is it about reincarnation? ﻿Uh-huh. ﻿Story ends with the hero praying that he’s never given such a life again. ﻿What are you looking at? ﻿The story’s a little bumpy. It’s close to reality. ﻿Screenplay is close to our daily shenanigans. ﻿Point of view of the father and the other characters. ﻿Parallel narratives. ﻿’ve dealt it a bit messily. ﻿And the final resolution is a daring step, I must admit. ﻿Wow! ﻿Yeah. I’ll give you my script.
