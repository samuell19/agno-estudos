Recently I told my older sister. "When there was a power outage a long time ago.. "Why do I remember a naked woman dancing?" Then she told me. "What are you talking about? "That was Mom" Oh...is that that was? I became convinced about a lot of stuff after that. When I was a high school girl... School life became pretty difficult somehow. And I shaved all the hair on my body. But the teachers would get mad at me. And my friends would start weird rumors about me. I became an outcast. It brings back the memories but.. A lot of those memories I don't want to remember. They've filled my mind recently though. Yasuko? Are you alive? Are you asleep Yasuko? shut up... Don't wake me up! Men can be so annoying. They don't let you sleep. Don't text me about stupid stuff. But wouldn't if be better if you woke up by yourself? Stop screwing with me. If your hypersomnia gets cured then I'll let out a huge sigh of relief. I'm gonna bug food. Ah, sorry. Why did you call me today? A you okay? Cigarettes cola. Sorry...yes. yes.. That person is a little bit sketch. yes! 17/ come an pick her up. Okay! I'm sorry about going without you. Pardon me! Umm...excuse me... Can you take care of Yasuko for me? Umm..yeah! I was going in her direction anyways. It's fine! Sorry about that! Thank you! Yasuko! He said he can walk you home. Oh really? It looks like he's going to walk you home. Sorry about that! Hey..are you okay? I'm okay...I‘m okay...totally... Hey come! Walk properly! I'll leave her to you. Sorry about that. I'll leave her to you. Sorry about that. Please enjoy yourselves. Be safe on your way back home okay? I'm just the thorn that they shake off. Sorry about that! No..it's okay. Is it okay for you to leave your friends? you talking about the drinking party? I think that it's better for everyone else if I'm not there. What about you Yasuko-san? It's okay! actually...I think they may have regretted it today... Inviting me that is. I'll make those bitches regret it! So...who are you? Who were you again? Ahh...my name is Tsunaki. I'm a magazine editor from "Weekly Saturday Might". Weekly Saturday Night you said? Is it that tabloid? Wasn't there an actress who committed suicide the other day? you guys released a stupid picture of her infidelity... yeah...we Di do that. What do you think about that? I think it's the worst thing you can do. That is true. It is terrible. People who try to find and exploit the bad parts about people. And stick to them like moss...are the people I hate. I'm sorry... That's why I understand the feelings of wanting to die a little bit too. I also feel like people are always looking at me to make themselves feel better. Alright! Here we go! Why are you doing that kind of job? Well...It kinda just happened... Kinda just happened? Ah..no..well...I've always wanted to become a writer. yeah? yes. And then... I got into a company. And I got assigned to the place where I am now.. It's just...I couldn't get any news coverage.. Well...that would make sense. And so then they just put me in a trade that they said would be a good fit for me. How boring! you are really boring man! It's actually impressive! Let's just say that I was you..if I was you. I'd drop dead right here because of the boredom! By the way...(yes?) What kind of work are you doing right now Yasuko-san? I'm unemployed. I bought it... No, no..It's okay. Hold on...you're bleeding! Women bleed once a month. you're bleeding a lot....do you want to go to the hospital? I don't have insurance so it's fine. But more importantly... In times like these. I want to run full speed ahead. I bought it. The cola. Can you stop tightening the cap too tight? For real... I can't open it. What do you want to eat? I bought a bento box. I'm telling you to stop with the cola. Do you understand? Sorry.. Hey.. What about your gloves? your gloves. you didn't use them? Oh...I forgot them. It was super cold today wasn't it? yeah. Why didn't you use them? The gloves that I made for you. Use them. Okay. I understand. Instead of just understanding... Use them right now. Right now? Right Stop screwing around! I'm not really screwing around though.. you are screwing around! Why do you put on gloves like that inside the house? That's hella weird! But you told me to didn't you? So what? Do you actually stop to think about something before you do it? Use your own head. Sorry.. What does that sorry supposed to mean? Why do you always apologize? Whatever. What? you don't have time to clean up your own room? yeah. I was a little bit busy today. I'm depressed today after all. yeah. Do you want the yakisoba or the Katsudon one? What about you? (The Katsudon) Me too. Alright, give me half of it later. Thanks for the food. It's frozen! It was pretty cold outside after all. Sometimes you want to eat something warm huh? Not just a bento. Ahh...sorry. Is it a black out? I'll go check it out. It's really been acting up recently huh? Yeah. Is something wrong? No. yasuko. I brought you some application papers. I don't want to work in a convenience store Why Working in a convenience store when you're depressed is the worst. Oneechan? Morning. Don't give me that. It's three in the afternoon. Hey...did you fall asleep again? I'm awake aren't I? I can open my eyes perfectly... This chick is bad news. your Dad... What? He asked me if you are still alive. And he asked if you're eating properly...he's being really annoying.. I'm sorry for being a bad daughter. you know what? you really need to start getting your life together. It's a nice year to do so. I don't even know if your boyfriend is going to kick you out of the house or what. Hey... Sometimes.. you sleep a ton don't you? A depressed woman huh? It's no wonder that people stop being fond of you. your personality is awful too. Besides...you don't clean or work at all do you? Do you know what challenge is? Challenge? What kind of job is that? I'm going to an interview for a convenience store tomorrow! Is that so? Then do your best alright? I'll do my best! yeah. Later. Okay. Okay. Okay! This is no good! Next! Igawa! This level of titty is weak sauce! This level of titty is weak sauce! This level of titty is weak sauce! Next! Wow! This is nasty! Is this girl a prostitute? Kisaki! Where do you think her hand is? That's pretty sketch isn't that? (It's bad! It's bad!) That's really bad! They said it's Nishiazabu's uncle's material. For crying out loud! That guy is irresponsible! The next issue is now sold out. It's a story that the other networks can't use! It's just..we don't have enough people. Hey Tsunagi! Write about this! It's impossible. I'm already working on Suzaki's part. Huh? Isn't Suzaki-San hospitalized? Wasn't he really depressed? If you take a break then you're going to wind up like that too. His wife is looking after him and he can't do anything by himself. How scary. Well...I won't be able to take in any more work. Then what are we going to do about this material Misato. Everyone is going to want a piece of this ass! Any other material is better! Think of something on your own! I am thinking about it... Hey..what happened with the news about the actress? Tsunagi-chan is our only option here. I don't need any literary expressions alright? Yasuko? Yes? How's your job going yasuko? Huh? What? Have you gone to the interview yet? I couldn't get a hold of them. It's over. It's over yasuko. I knew. From way before... It's the third time already. Is there no hope for me anymore? I'm starving. Is there anything you want to eat today? Hamburgers or fried eggs...something like that. Is that your girlfriend? How nice. She's the type that can make meals. No..she can't cook anything. But like...don't spy on me. I'm a reporter of a gossip magazine after all. How many years have you been here? 2 years. It's only been two years huh? I wonder if I have changed? I just wanted to write manga but I ended up joining this company.. I didn't think I would get involved in something like this. isn't that article pretty bad? I don't think Kisaki-San did a good job picking that up. An actress committing suicide again. I don't want that. What's up with that? I mean didn't it happen before? Well...if we give it some time. Everyone will forget about it. What's up with that? Then are we just forgetting about everything in order to do this job? Excuse me. you guys don't have minced No, we ran out of it today. It doesn't matter if it's beef mixed with pork, beef, or pork. No, like I said...we ran out of it for today. We had just a little bit of it not that long ago though. Sorry about that! we rarely sell out of it though. Ah! The beef that we bought today is yummy! I'm going to make it. I forgot to buy miso for the soup. It's okay. We don't need Why? Why does it have to be now Pick up... Pick up... Huh? Huh? Huh? Where? Pick up. Huh? yasuko? Ah..is it a blackout? What are you doing on the floor? Come on... Yes? Umm... you know what? you've just been saying "yeah” and "Who knows" Are you listening to what I'm saying? yes. So then...I just so happened to see him at the train station I was surprised that he looked so adult-like. He used to be so child-like before... Men sure do change in 3 years huh? Isn't that right? He's become a full on man now huh? yeah. That's why I ended up following him. And then I saw that you were there... Then I understood. That person is still working for Saturday night huh? Did he get a little promotion? Who knows. you're just living in his house, camping out in there... And you don't know anything about him do you? I can't leave him to you after all. you said it before right? you said that it's not going too well. But like...why are you even dating him? It should be fine right? Break up with him. I want to make it clear before his birthday. Whether or not he's gonna come back to me. He's not going to be happy. With such a dull birthday party. Do you have anything to say? I don't! When you think about Tsunagi's personality... He'll come back to his ex-girlfriend. He won't be able to tell you to get out would he? That's why you need to speak to him first. I think it's necessary for you to tell him that you're leaving him. Well..umm...Even if I leave... I don't have any money. But you know what? you're unemployed 24 hours a day and you're overwhelming him. What do you think about leeching off a wan and having him feed you while you just sleep? I was watching you at the supermarket. you're pretty bad aren't you? I'm wondering why Tsunagi is with a person like you. I'm not going to listen to your excuse about how you can't leave because you have no money. If you are in a really tight spot... Then why don't you do some kind of nightlife job or whatever it takes? Saying that you can't work because of depression is just playing him for a fool. Me and him are people that work. Everyone works. you'll just end up telling him that you ran into some weird woman.... Anyone would say that wouldn't they? No..that's not my intention. Then what? Are you not going to talk about me? you don't want to say that I'm overly self-conscious? It's fine. If you don't tell Tsunagi anything about me. If you tell him anything. I'm going to die. That will be the best method for bringing trouble to you. Umm. How can I say this? Isn't your condition worse than mine? Hey! Someone like you who is unemployed and living without a purpose. Shouldn't be compared to someone like me! Every single damn day I'm sweating and working hard! Umm. Good work. Hey! Are you mocking me? No, no, no, no! That wasn't my intention at all! Not even for a second. excuse me Ando-San. Can you stop shouting? First...in order for you to leave the house... you need to find a way to make money. Do you understand that? yeah. Are you really going to work? I will! That's a lie isn't it? It's not a lie Are you being serious? yes I am. Then it's all good. Later.. yes! Maki-San! Aren't you hiring people here? Hiring huh? But..we have enough people right now don't we? No, it's fine. No, it's fine. Come in. How about you start tomorrow? Well...ummm... I'm a little... umm...how do I say this? I can't cook. I'm mentally unstable. And sometimes I faint... That's why working here...seems a little impossible for me. That's fine. Do you have some time after this? Maki, can you explain things to her a little bit? Okay. Thank goodness! Later! I'll leave it to you. The outfit is very basic. It's going to be a white shirt on top. we also have a store apron too. Here. Well..umm..I.. I don't have any white shirts. Not even one? Then I'll let her borrow one. I'm not going to be here for much longer. Well..umm... That girl is Rina. She's going to quit pretty soon but... Rina has been doing this for 3 years. If you don't understand something then ask Rina okay? I'm Maki. And the owner is over there. You'll learn all the other details on the job. Hey. Why do you want to work here? well. Rather than wanting to work here.. you want to get better don't you? What do you mean "Get better"? Does she have some kind of problem? Is she a problem child? She has some kind of depression. Well..I do have depression but... It's not exactly like real depression... It's more like a joke. Can depression really be a joke? A ton of weirdos end up coming to this shop. The same goes for you. No, no, no..Murata-San... I'm working pretty hard aren't I? This girl was a hikkimori. *A hikkimori is a shut-in introvert* Right? Really? She doesn't seem that way at all... Are you looking down on me? No, no, no...That's not it. It really is amazing. Stop it. you're kinda....cute too. I said to knock it off... That girl gets embarrassed easily. you have it pretty rough too don't you? you get entangled by people like Ando-San. Do you really have depression yasuko-chan? Things like depression end up making you lonely doesn't it? If you eat together with us, you'll get over it right away! Murata-san's cooking is super yummy! If you want to try it out then we'll support you. Put your all into it. Come here at tomorrow. 10? It's no good! It's no good! It's no good! Mo, I only work on my computer. I have all the data on there. yes. No I'll be able to do it. I'll send it tomorrow. yes. Am I going to do that? Okay. Okay. Good work. you're awake. Curry or yakisoba. Which one do you want to eat? you can eat the one that you want. Isn't this yours? I threw it away. On the road? On the road. Hey. Hey. yeah? A lot of stuff happened today. Okay. I thought about working. It's a cafe diner though. isn't that good? It seems like you're doing okay. Give me some of your taste. I'm sorry! you're late! Oh..Rina left a white shirt for you in the locker. It's in the locker. Go try it on. yes! yes! I'm sorry! This is yours from now on. From Rina. Oneechan, I found a job! He...Hey! Oh crap! you broke it because it was my order. you did it on purpose didn't you? No! That's not it! I'm really sorry! Here's your food! you're still here? It's close to the submission date but you're still working on it. you must be pretty worn out. Thanks. I'm sorry about the other day. Well...I got into an argument with you about the article. The one that caused the girl to commit suicide.... I was the one in charge of that article. A lot of trouble happened because of it. I should just quit this job already. Why don't you just stop You've been polishing that for 30 minutes now. Well. There was stain on there so I thought I should get rid of if. No...you're causing a bigger stain! Umm...am I...doing okay? you're totally not okay at all. I'm a nuisance after all aren't I? Well..if you call yourself a nuisance...you might just be one... I'm pretty interesting too. It's fine isn't it? Alright, I'll let you lock it up. Tsunagi! you're really late from work aren't you? There was someone there in the office. The amount of work has increased a lot. There isn't anyone else who can do if? It seems like there isn't. Did you notice it yet? yeah. It's been a while since the two of us have been out together huh? yeah. It's cold! It's cold! So how's your job going? If kinda....seems like they're letting me do it. Oh, that's good to hear. Later, I'm going to bed now. They should be getting really mad at me... But everyone there is so kind. Or rather than just kind. They have a wide capacity. Sorry. Can you let me sleep? Hello? It's already 11. We'll be waiting for you. For real? Crap..crap. I'm sorry! you haven't told Tsunagi anything about me have you? I haven't said anything to him... Thank goodness. you at least have a small amount of pride huh? So? When are you planning on leaving the house? Well...I just started working didn't I? I don't really know whether or not it's going to work out yet. you're making a fool out of me aren't you? No... I told you that I'm not making a fool out of you. Why do you always say that? you know what? you're just a selfish person. Have you ever thought about how lowly you are? Because of you the people around you won't be able to become happy. Have you ever thought about that? you wouldn't be able to think about anything serious like that. Why am I trying so hard at my job? It's like I'm trying to win a crappy lottery with you. It really is a crappy lottery... If you don't have the will to work or do anything... Then I should just die huh? Sleeping forever and dying is the same thing right? Hey! Why are you sleeping? Don't you understand that this is the job that I introduced you too? Well...This was overwhelming for me in the first place.. Ando-San...your voice is always too loud. yasuko. Let's just get to work for now. Hey Ando-San. Why are you obsessed with that man? Well...it's not like I broke up with him because I hated him Something just popped up... But don't you think that the way you do things is strange? Tsunagi being with that girl is the strange thing! He has stress from work... And she's kinda crazy in the head... I mean...men time things a certain way right? That's why he's going to get hurt. He doesn't have anyone to support him right now.. Besides..aren't I the only that can help him? I don't know about any of that! Besides I don't even know who he is Stop getting us involved in this. That woman came again. It's like the third day straight. isn't it good that you can stay awake? excuse me. yes please. Okay! I would like the cheese platter and the seafood frit please. yes! yes! Can you bring the dishes out for now? Yasuko. you're sleeping in the bathroom aren't you? No...I'm not sleeping. Don't you spend 30 minutes in the bathroom? I'm not in there that long. you are. Do you pass out without realizing how long it's been? If you're forcing yourself to do this for others... Then you're never going to change. Oyako or Neapolitan. Which one do you want to eat? Hey..you know what? Recently my oversleeping problem has been pretty bad. yeah. you come home late then sleep. Then you go to your job in the morning right? yeah. Why can you do what I can't? yeah. Hey. you know what? I'm a little troubled by other things as well. yeah. you've just been saying "yeah, yeah" this entire time! you're definitely not listening to what I'm saying! Tsunagi? Tsunagi-San? Your package is here. Tsunagi-San? Coming! Tsunagi-san? I have a package for you. Okay! Tsunagi-San? Hey! Are you planning on sleeping forever and not coming into work? No.. Hey...open this door! Hey. Long time no see. I'm sorry... Yasuko-chan. Go get dressed. Well...it might be all in vain anyways. you don't really want to make money do you? Even if you're against it. These people and me. Are just wasting our time. A Carponara and a Genovese please! Okay! Thanks for waiting. It's here! Which one was it again? Oh...it was the seasonal vegetable pasta! sorry about that, yes! Excuse me, thanks for wa... Oh, I'm sorry! Excuse me! Here's your coffee. Yasuko. Take this to table three, Okay! Table three! Thanks for waiting. Here's your salad set. Excuse me! Yes? Can we get 2 homemade Tiramisu? Sure! 2 Tiramisu? Yes! The crisis in the Tokyo Olympics. Tsunagi Why did you just put this in here without permission? This isn't the article you were going to do! What the hell? Did you do this alone? This kind of thing will spell disaster for our company! Everyone will forget about it soon. Think about this for a bit! Just thinking about it. Enough! Where is your previous article? Give it to me right now. Hey! Hey! Tsunagi! Give it to me damn it! Give it to me! Tsunagi! Tsunagi.. yasuko-chan. That's enough for now. Come over here and eat. It's gotten a little chilly. Yeah. It’s a little bit cold huh? Here! Go ahead. I'm sorry about the glass. Enough about the glass. But yasuko-chan... Is depression an illness that makes you want to sleep or something? Rather than just sleeping. Does it also cause you to skip work? That's true. Rather than not answering her calls she just didn't come in. I'm sorry. Normally you wouldn't be able to do that but... This person right here is very relaxed. Thanks. But. you've managed to survive until now.. What kind of depression do you have? She was just lonely wasn't she? That's why being together with everyone like this is the best thing for her. you'll get over this won't you? yeah. It's going to be okay. Oh..this Ratatouille turned out good. It's yummy. I wonder if I put enough garlic in it? I think you did. It's good! (Is it okay?) Teach me how to make it next time. It's a little too soon for you. Why is that? Please teach me! Not yet. Hey! Hey! That's the most expensive drink we have! It's all thanks to It's fine! Drink up! Drink up! it's Ando-san's isn't it? (It's fine!) I'm gonna drink some too. Umm. Will I be able to make it work? you will. One way or another, you're young after all. Even if you're no good right now you won't stay that way forever. Can I be here? What are you saying? Jeez. We're like family aren't we? Hey. Eat up! Rina. Eat the cheesecake. Get fatter. Why do you want me to get fatter? I'll take the bread too. Eat that with the Ratatouille. Follow his lead. What are you going to do next time? Open your mouth up wide. Just like that! Man...that makes me laugh! I mean...remember when came? yasuko-chan got the whiskey all over her! That's right! That's right! She totally did that on purpose! I thought "Amazing! Way to go!" But then she actually got on her hands and knees! But Ando-San helped yasuko get back to society though didn't she? She totally doesn't understand that! That's right! That's right! She just becomes obsessed with a man and can't see anything else. She's something else.. Hey, hey! Why are you laughing? you're the cause aren't you? you're creeping me out! I'm creeping you out? That's the first time I've seen you laughing. Hold up...yasuko broke. I haven't broke. Jeez. I'm gonna go to the bathroom really quick. You've gone to the bathroom a ton haven't you? What? Do you have diarrhea? No..(Is that right?) No..umm..that's not it! But you've been stuck in there all day long. Oh, really No, that's really not it! I can't use the fancy toilets with functions very well. Why not? All you have to do is push down the button. It's a little bit scary isn't it? you don't know where the water going to shoot up. Where? It shoots in the center. The center. That's true but what if it's broken and it shoots a very powerful stream at a weird spot? Haven't you thought about how dangerous that could be? There's no way we would think about that. Is your head okay? No I mean...Water can cut through anything right? I saw this online but water can even cut through iron So that's why if it's broken. It could split your body in half! Also! It shoots you at a strange angle. The water just shoots right up in your butt! What the heck? The fancy toilets are scary aren't they? What's wrong yasuko? Did you drink too much? Hey Rina...eat some more! I'm eating! Have some cheese. Hey. The Ratatouille is going to get cold. Is the fancy toilet scary? No.. Well..to be honest I don't really understand what she's saying. yeah. She started laughing out of nowhere. Is that how bipolar people are like? I wonder.. How did it go with that? Are you okay? Are you doing well at your job? Giving it your all? She's not going to come out. Are you doing well at your job? Giving it your all? She's not going to come out. What do you think? What do we think? Isn't it going to be too tough for her to work together with us? It's not too tough for her? Is she okay? Don't say that kind of thing. That's pretty awful. Why do you say that? She's doing her best. She's going to be okay! You used to be a hikkimori too! Well, that's true but. you should know. Well...I know my own condition though. But up until now you were only able to see things from one point of view. That's why we had to deal with that. Later. Good work. I'm sorry. It's because I said a lot of things to you. I was already disgusted by it. It seems like the article about the actress has been suspended. Is that so? But I didn't think you would do that... It was my own fault that I got fired. you told me before. "I never intended to get involved in this kind of thing." I'm the same way. you told me that you were in charge of that article that caused someone to die. I knew about the article too though. But I didn't personally write it. I had nothing to do with it. Tsunagi-San. People say those kinds of things. I don't really think so. Tsunagi. What? you know what? This is no good. What? Is doing this now no good? Right now is no good. Right now is...no good. Are you talking about when I hit the wall of the house? I'm sorry. That's not it. It seems like I didn't understand anyone. What are you talking about? They are all amazing people. More amazing than you. I mean, you have gotten physical more than they have. And they listen to me. But you know what? I found them. I overlooked them. It really is no good. I'm really worn out. Just living...is so tiring. Where are you right now? yasuko-chan? Are you okay? Yasuko-chan? Are you okay? Yasuko-chan? Are you okay? yasuko! Hey... Are you okay? Yasuko-chan! Yasuko-chan! Hey! Yasuko! Yasuko! What? Oh sorry! It must be the breaker! Where is the breaker? (What? What?) I saw her! Hey yasuko? yasuko-chan? W-what's going on? Hey. Was the person running just now yasuko? What are you doing? I'm resurrected. Why did you get naked? Wasn't this your first job? It was my first job. This is the first time I've gotten naked like this. you're going to fall! you just got back from work. And you have to deal with a woman like this. It must be tough for you too. What about your depression? It's over. Is that right? It lasted for a long time didn't it? But it's changed into something like this though... For you to do that out of nowhere surprised me a little. It's cold so let's go inside for now. I want to tell you something. Sure. Do we have to have this conversation out here with you naked? Sorry. I need to be naked right here. I understand. Tsunagi. you get tired of me don't you? I don't really think that's the case. you don't? you do! It's because things have been difficult at work after all. Sorry. Is it okay if I say something you don't want to hear? yeah. It pisses me off when I see how laid-back you are. I'm hitting you with all of my emotions... yet you're so laid-back. The words that you choose. Aren't your emotions but rather... They're words to calm me down aren't the ? Sorry. Like I said...what does that sorry even mean? I think I'm probably misunderstanding you a lot but... There is a really good way in not offending me. For now don't just nod your head and agree. Speak while thinking on the same level that I'm thinking. And show me the same energy that I'm showing you! Okay. I want you to be the same as me. I want you to be as tired as me. Am I dependent? The people at work. They are super nice and good people. And for a second I thought. Ah...Is this what living is?" I cried. Tsunagi. I'm really weak. When people are kind to me.. But.. Something is off isn't it? They are good people. They told me to think of them as family. And that made me happy of course. I thought that I could finally live! I really thought that out of nowhere. What's up with that? I just started telling them about how the fancy toilet could break... And suddenly I didn't know what to do anymore.. Hey. It's just a fancy toilet. I really thought about treasuring that place and making it my own... But then I just destroyed every chance of that... I'm no good. Really... Hey. What should I do? I'm no good. My head isn't right. I... Always get mad at you and act insane around you don't I? But I don't understand I get mad... And I always beat myself up about things... But. If I do my best and start really living then I might get trapped... And then after that. I thought about how my depression would come back again. Damn...damn...damn. I don't know what to do anymore damn it! Hey. Why am I like this? Just living tires me out. If you broke up with me. you can break up with me. I can't break up with you. I want to be together...forever. Tsunagi. If you broke up with me. It would be good for you. Hey. What part of me do you like? Can you tell me? This is the last time. Why have you been with me...for three years? I wonder why? we first met at the drinking party didn't we? And on the way home. you told me that everyone overlooks you. And I was surprised. in the past... There were times where I had a similar feeling But I... I kept my distance from everything to keep myself safe. But you hit your head making yourself bleed. And you started running for no reason. I thought that was amazing. On the path when I started running after you... you had on a blue skirt. And I thought it was so beautiful. It's kinda like.. I don't really understand why. But I felt like seeing something beautiful again. is that the reason why you stayed with me? That's not all. Tsunagi.. you're pretty crazy in the head too aren't you? I didn't know that. Today.. What? I got fired from my job. I got a little pissed off... And I threw my laptop from the window. Tsunagi... you did something I would do. you got that right. Tsunagi Why are you here? I should be saying that to you! What are you doing in a place like this? It's cold! It's cold Again? you didn't turn off the power on purpose did you? I really want to know. More about you. we probably understood a little bit about why we got together just for a second... But. In that second. I felt like I was alive.
