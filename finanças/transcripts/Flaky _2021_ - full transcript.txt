You know, um... - This is really late. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys. I'm late. - Hey! - I'm coming right out. You're lucky she didn't show up this morning. I need two shrimp saut√©s, and I need a lobster mac and cheese, and a fish and chips combo. And a fish and chips combo... Come on, IB, you always do this! You and Mimi, man! Don't leave me out here with this crazy lady. I need help! - Hi. - Hi. So, I would like a... a medium-size fry with lobster sauce, and maybe... um, hm, a small mac and cheese by the side? Uh, do you want the mac and cheese? I'm still thinking about it. What do you think? Uh, it's whatever you want. I know. But that's why I'm asking you, because you work here, you know? You would know better. Uh... Well, what's with the attitude? I don't understand. Uh-uh-uh. See, you, gonna have to lower your voice. If you don't wanna be here, and I understand that, but I'm not your problem! Do you still want the mac and cheese? Where's your manager? Yo, I've been in line, like, forever! Boy. Miss, do you still want the mac and cheese? There's a line of people waiting. You are dumb rude. Do you know that? No, I don't. Come on, for God's sake. I wanna talk to your manager! The manager isn't here. You can drop a note though. Okay. Uh, hello! You. Hi. Yes, hi. Is your manager here? Okay, well, then, who is responsible for having this dumb chick here? Hello? The manager is. Come on, I gotta get to work, fam. Ah! You are mad disrespectful. Ma'am, do you still want the mac and cheese? Are you calling me old? No, I'm just trying to be respectful. Come on! Anytime before my social security kicks in! - Just give me my damn fry, okay? - Okay. And give me my damn mac and cheese! Would you mind stepping aside so I can attend to that gentleman right behind you? Jeez! Rest of us not hungry up in here? I'm sorry about that. What can I get you? Can I get a alfredo guchini... linguini? Can I get a 12-piece chicken? And, uh... you take EBT in here? Uh... no. No, we don't. I know. I'm just messing with you. That's really funny. I know. It works every time. - Right. - There you go, sweetie. Thanks. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Did you hear all of that? "Get my damn fries and my damn mac and cheese." You know, you're supposed to be looking for your manager right about now. Well, the manager ain't here. This woman does this all the time when she walks into this place. Like I stole her man or something. Maybe you did. Murphy, whose side you on? Check your pocket. Maybe you did. Trust me, I try to be so nice to her every time. I even give her compliments. Look, she don't want your compliments. She wants her man back. Give her her man back. - Just give her her man back. - Order's ready! - I'm sorry! - Oh, oh, oh, I heard something. I'm coming. I'm coming. Okay. Have a wonderful day. Gonna flip. Oh, my God. Man, it's crazy how it gets so slow. In minutes. I hate it when it's slow. Why? There's less madness. It just becomes so draggy and all-around weird. You Africans love to work to death. Hey, you can't speak for every African. I know about Nigerians. Uh-huh. No, it's just... it's just so weird being categorized in general as an African when we have so many different diverse cultures and I'm not even sure if we all like each other. Mm. You mean like African-Americans? Light skin, dark skin. The shit drives me crazy all the time. When we have so much bigger problems. And I'm not just talking about electricity and water, - and what they show on the news. - Hmm. What'd you study again? How many times are you gonna ask me that question? Aliyah! I just keep forgetting. Sociology. Oh, yeah. I hope to go back to college, you know? I can't do this forever. It's either that, or this, or some other way. What other way? What are you doing Friday? After work. Nothing. A friend of mine is having a rooftop party. - You wanna come through? - Sure! I need every leisure I can get right now. It's in Williamsburg, 10:00 p.m. Boogie. Cool! Ah. Alrighty. What are you talking about? You saw her, didn't you? She knew what she was doing. Wearing that dress, trying to be slick and shit. Yes! My thoughts exactly! You know she cray-cray. Talkin' bout him and her and where they gon' be, in my face! Girl, hold on. What? The pizza box is empty. I don't need it. You can throw it away. I mean, you could've just thrown it away yourself after you got the last slice out of the box. I'll call you back. I mean, it's not an issue. I just think... - You got a problem with me? - No, of course not! It looks like you got something to say. I already said what I wanted to say. Nah, it looks like you got somethin' to say, sis, so just go ahead and say it. Like I said, I already said what I wanted to say. It's not that serious. It's just a box. You can throw it away if it's bothering you that much. It's the refrigerator. It's also a mess. Oh, geez. Yeah. Yes! Oh, okay, I was saying... No, you were saying. Oh, no. It wasn't important. Girl! Of course. You know I don't play. Man no come to this country to come die and beg. Oh, shit. Oh, God. Oh, shit. Oh. Just perfect. Oh, my gosh. ...will be held due to congestion at the terminal. Bay Ridge-95th Street, There's two trains at the terminal. - Once the train departs from Bay Ridge-95th Street... - No, no, no. Come on! Which kind of wahala be this? I know. What time is it? - Mimi, I'm sorry. I can explain. - What time is it? - 9:55. - I can't hear you. You got to speak up. 9:55. And what time do I pay you to get here? - Mimi, I'm sorry... - What time do I pay you to get here? 9:30. You hear what she said? She said she's supposed to be here at 9:30. - Mimi, I'm sorry... - You been know you supposed to be here. What the fuck this is? You think I'm running some kind of charity? Walking in here at past 9:30 like you own the fucking place. I didn't work my ass off, dancing for years, building this empire so you can come fuck shit up! There are a thousand people out here want this job! If you don't want it, fucking go back to Africa! Maybe you can find something meaningful over there. I mean, maybe this ain't for you. You never know. But I don't care if the sky is falling! I don't care if World War III is going on where you live! If you got a time to be at work, then be here! Don't play with my time! Don't play with my money! Last strike, IB! Order four? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, boy. - What? I have to call my mom and my bestie back home. Call 'em when you get off. - Time zone difference. - Ah! Got you. I feel like I've been all over the place, you know? Like, why is it so hard to be happy and just to do everything right? Well, if it's perfection you seek, only God is. But aren't we are made in his image? - Aren't we supposed to be like him? - We are not him. But aren't we supposed to be him? Okay. Just because MGK is white and can rap, that don't make him no Eminem. That is a rather far-fetched comparison. Kobe and Jordan. I actually like Kobe. Yeah, me too. What's up? Yo! What's up, stranger? - Eh. - Uh-huh. So, what's good? Just, wow. How you been? - Uh, you know. - No, I don't know. I'm out here grinding. Tryin' to make that paper. Mmm, yeah. I see you been rolling with Scoop Chip. Yeah, but that's old, though. You know, things didn't go as planned. He got a new team now. - Damn. - Yeah. Yo, so how's Auntie Nene? She's good! You know, just waiting on her ragged-ass nephew to come see her. I know. I gotta come see her soon, though. - Mm-hmm. - Why you always do that? - Hey. - Hmm? This my cousin, Reggie. Hey! Hey, what's up? Oh, the usual. You always been here? Uh, for almost over one year now. Crazy! I never seen you here. That's because the last time you was here was two years ago. Damn, Liyah. When was the last time I saw you, Reggie? Yep! Uncle Ray's funeral. Psh, this can go for hours. Yeah. A'ight! - I'ma try and visit more often. - Mm-hmm. Uh, I gotta head out now. I thought I'd just stop by and, you know, see how you doing. My bad. What's your name again? Uh, Ibinabo. Ibinabo. IB. Just... Just IB. Let me get more. Thank you. - Good-looking, cuz-o. - Mm-hmm. All right. Well, I guess I'll be seeing you around then, Ib. Maybe. Maybe. He's trouble. I'm serious. He's trouble, girl. Don't be late tomorrow. I won't, Mimi. This is 86th Street. Transfers available to the F-79 select bus service. Yes? Can I use some of your butter? What? Can you open the door if you can't hear me? What do you want? Can I have some of your butter? Yes! And some of your bacon, please? Yes, Kisha! Thank you. The artiste manager... I just wanna be crew! Check out most artistes, when they say en crue... the crue that they refer to... After 12. Ezinne's talk no go in tonight. I'll call her tomorrow. Where you at? What you mean, you're down the block? Deshawn, I swear to God, if I'm late... Come on. Oh, so good to see you. Everything okay? - Why you always stressing me out, man? - I'm stressing you out? - Yeah! - You know I gotta be at work by a certain time. You know that and yet you keep... What are you even talking about? I'm here, ain't I? That's the problem! You never take me serious. Look... I don't got time for this, okay? I'm just here to pick up my daughter, and if you got your own stuff going on, - that's your problem, all right? - It's never your problem. Whatever, man. Yet I've been seeing you running 'round with that light-skinned, fake titties-ass chick. Oh! That's your problem? You think I don't know about you and the fucking bus driv... I'm sorry, okay? No bad words, right? - Okay. - Okay. You think I don't know about you and this bus driver? Yeah, you're delusional, man. Be careful who you bring around my daughter. Go say bye to Mommy, okay? Mmm. Be good okay, baby? - Okay. - Mama's gonna come get you on Sunday. - All right. - All right. Come on, come on. You wanna go get some ice cream? - What kind of ice cream you want? - Chocolate. Chocolate? That's my favorite. Did you know that? - Don't give her too much sugar! - Okay, okay. You want chocolate and vanilla and strawberry? And whatever else you want! Okay. How is he? Don't worry, Mommy, I will send you money on Monday, and you will get it by Wednesday. I love you. Huh? Hey... hey, um, I'm guessing this is all yours. Uh-huh. Uh, well, it's been here over... almost two weeks now, and it's beginning to start to stink, if you know what I mean. Uh, well, I was hoping that maybe you can take it out? Since, like I said before, it's beginning to start to stink. Uh-huh. - He said you were rude! - Nah. Not this time. I ain't taking no insult from nobody. That's your problem, Aliyah. You don't listen. You think you know it all! You never wanna learn! I have been working my ass off in here every day for the last three years, nobody ever complained. One little, troublesome customer gives a little complaint and all of a sudden, I got a problem? Listen, you gotta listen to me. I own this place, and I know how it ought to operate. That has nothing to do with what we're talking about. I know you own this place. - I own the place where you work! - I know! And if you wanna keep working here, you gotta do what I say! Every organization got rules. Just fucking follow 'em, goddamn it! Really? Really, Mimi? You heard me. I ain't repeating myself. But I will if you want me to. A'ight. I've got you. Ow! Fuck! I hate this place! I really gotta get outta here. - Number 27? - Mm-hmm. - Have a wonderful day. - Thank you. Come on. Cheer up now. I'm just tired of this lifestyle, bruh. Getting tired of all of this. Everybody! This place, Mimi, my baby daddy, my family! I'm just tired! Are you even tired of me? Shut up. Nah, but seriously? I really need to get outta here. I gotta build a better life for me and my daughter. Meanwhile, you still coming out tonight? Fo' sho'! You know, you're not the only person in this place who needs a break. Mm. She gon' need another butt implant, 'cause that ass already falling off! I don't care. - So... carrot cakes? - So... - Yes. - Eww. But I can't wait to try the sunflower seeds. Sorry, B, one second. - What? - 'Cause of him? He got no game! I swear, if I knew you was gonna be here, I wouldn't have come. What do you want? - Where is she? - Who? You know, the girl you work with, the one from the restaurant. - Oh! - Come on, cuz. Oh, look, I don't want you messing with my friend. She's a good girl. - So what am I? - Nigga, you trouble. Our family's made up of trouble, Liyah. That's how we survive. Listen, I only came here because I thought that... Okay. Go. Hey! Hey! Hey. Is there something in your eye, Reggie? Wait. What? Oh, look. I mean, how you gonna leave a good-looking guy like that standing all alone at a party like this with all these hot chicks? You literally just pulled me away from him. Why don't you go get him, tiger? I... really hate you right now. I just want you to know. Let me know if you need saving. I will. - She's always a vibe. - I know. You want a drink? Uh, yes, please. There you go. What's in it? It's a mixture of a little something-something. Mm-hmm. I'm just messing with you. It's a margarita. Cheers. So word on street is, uh, you got a Bachelor's degree in sociology and a Masters in art. "Word on the street," huh? Hey, I ain't no snitch. That's what they all say. So, am I wrong? You know the streets don't lie. Well, yes. I have a Bachelor's in sociology from UNILAG. That's the University of Lagos in Nigeria. I have my Masters from NYU, but that was after I got my scholarship. And I'm a gold medal... track and field athlete. Really? I didn't know that. The street doesn't tell you everything, does it? Nope. I'm not, like, an Olympic gold medalist, but I am an all-African game gold medalist. Wait, so you got a lot of money? No. It doesn't work like that. They don't care about athletes in Nigeria. They just need you for a moment. You know, the sports organization is just as corrupt as the politicians. You can't keep those in power accountable. I mean, if you want to live, you have to keep shut and just go with the flow. Is that why the Internet scammers are Nigerian? I mean, no offense. None taken, honestly. You see, the thing is is that there is more American scammers than Nigerians. It's just that the media has the opportunity to just pick and choose - what they want to represent the country as. - Facts. You know, here, we have the opportunity of education. Financial aid. Scholarship. All of that. But back there? You get what you pay for. And in pursuit of this American dream, I just have to take whatever job I can to not only provide for myself, but to provide for my family back home. And that is a major responsibility. Damn. I never thought of it like that. Well, that's the school of life. And that's not in the academic curriculum. So, do you change your accent when you talk to people from back home? - Yes, of course. - Hi. Let's get a picture. Okay? - Sure! - Not you, fool! We're gonna start with you because you look so good in that dress. Oh! Yes. Oh! Right there! Right there! Yes! Ahh... Okay, now us. Okay. Aliyah, you ruined the picture. Are you gonna get in? - Ahh, let's get it. - All right. Okay, okay. Ohh! I am going to send these to you. Well, folks, I'm outta here. - Already? - Uh, yeah. And like I said, let me know if you need saving. I will. Okay. Hasta la vista, baby! Oh, my goodness! Finally. Hey. She can be a lot. This party is already getting boring. Wanna go for a walk? - Okay. - Yeah? I had a good time tonight, even though we were just walking, you know? I hope you did too. Yeah. It was... it was actually really cool. Yeah. Oh. It's Aliyah. Oh! Look at that. Damn! You fine. The one with me is the best though. You really do love yourself. I can't deny that. Oh, shoot. I have to go home. I have work in the morning. Well, I hope to see you soon and do this again. Me too. Are you free tomorrow evening? We could do a little something. Well, I get off at 9:00, so anything after. - Well, I'll let you know then. - Okay. I gotta go. I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. - Hey! - Hey. You okay? I'm good, I'm good. Hey, hey. Hey, what... what's going... oh, my God, Kisha. Oh. Talk to me. What's going on? Oh, it doesn't matter. What? It doesn't matter! Nothing matters anymore! - It's gonna be okay. - It's not gonna be okay! Okay, Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but talk to me, please. What happened? I've been... forgetting things. Oh. That's okay. I forget things too. We all do. No, like, I've really been forgetting things. I went to the doctor and... got the results. I have a brain tumor. Oh, my God. Oh. I'm just 23, bro! Damn! I'm just 23. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's okay, it's okay. Why me? Why me? It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What are you talking about? Look at it! Go through the records yourself! I ain't got time for that, Aliyah. You never have time for nothing! You know what? I'm done. Fuck this. What do you mean you're done? There's a thousand people out there who want this job! Fuck you, Mimi! You're fired! You're so dumb! I said I was done! Don't waste your life like I did. What are you looking at? Your cousin went off today. There's a limit that Aliyah can take. And one thing I know is that she knows her worth. I've only seen her, like, twice like that. Today and the other time when she went off on her baby daddy. Yeah! That relationship, that's something else. At least they do a good job parenting. I can agree to that. Also, I've been trying to get in touch with her, but there's no response. Just give her some time. She'll reach out. I just wanna make sure she's okay. Trust me, she is. She's probably got a joint in her hand right now. Wanna go back to your place? I have work in the morning. I'll wake you up. Yeah? We'll see. You good... you get on top, right? Yeah, lemme... that way. Okay. All right. Here we go. - Oh, sorry. - What the fuck is this thing? All right, all right, wait. Okay. Let's try it the other way. Let's try it the other way. All right. Get up. Where you going so early? To work. Did you forget your cousin quit? I have to fill in for her before we find a replacement. Which should be in a few days. Oh, yeah. Oh, you don't have to leave now. Just make sure you close the door properly. It locks on itself. Hey! I'll see you later. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I should be on the plane to North Carolina by the time you're reading this. I got just a few years to live, and if I'm gonna go, I'm gonna spend my last few years with my family. You are definitely the best roommate I ever had. You cared. Stay alive. Kisha. I'm sorry. I've been crazy-busy at work, and there's a lot going on over here. I've been meaning to call you. Chika lost her mom. - When? - Two weeks ago. Oh, my God! And I know how much her mom means to her. You should call her. I will definitely call her tomorrow. I think by now, she will be asleep. I said I'm sorry nau. Ahh. It's almost 3:00 a.m. here. I have work in the morning. No. No, no, no. No, no. No. No. No. No. No. No, no, no, no. Oh... No, no. No, no. No. Call me back when you get this! Call me back! I know you're missing my phone calls! I know you can see it! It'll be okay. IB! Oh, my... IB! Reggie. Reggie... I need you to call me back. Please. Call me back! You got it baby. Come on, give me two more. Come on, get that money right in a row. - Dang! - Yeah, baby. Gimme that. You brought it, son. 'Course, none of my niggas here to see it. - Another one? - No, go. Oh, come on. Yo. Yo, we need more beer. You got the money. You're right. I've been calling you. Where's my money, Reggie? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You damn liar! You stole my money! That was my savings! Why? How could you? Listen here, bitch, I don't know what you're talking about. You damn liar. You piece of shit! Well, I wasn't when I was between your legs, was I? Now what you gonna do? You gonna call the cops? I see your visa already expired. Now, you don't wanna get deported to your shithole, do you? Now bounce, bitch! What the fuck? Reggie! Reggie, you good? Reggie? Bro! Fuck. Reggie. Reggie, you good? Bro, go get her! - How you doing? You all right? - Good. Go get her! Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Open up, Ib! Ib, come out right now. Open up! I know you're in there! Open up! What? You got a problem? Yeah, that's what I thought. Ib, come out right now! Say what, nigga! Man, chill. This nigga bothering you? You better get the fuck outta here. All right, all right. Walk, nigga! Bitch ass. My mixtape drops tomorrow. My name's Lil Rodeo. Check me out, all right? Good night. I've been trying to reach you for days. What's going on? Are you okay? I don't know. It just feels like every time things begin to work out, it falls down. Where is that coming from? No, no, stop. Don't say that anymore. There's power in your words. Just because you've made a few mistakes and things are not working out as planned, does not mean you've lost your self-worth and value. Listen. Challenges are bound to happen. And it's our ability to overcome them that makes us strong. Just because an acatar managed to scam you doesn't mean you have to stop being yourself. Baby, we have been through worse. And yet, we stand. Do not let anything nor anyone take away your joy. And most importantly, you have to create a relationship with God. He's everything. He would always be there for you, and He would take care of you. Okay? I have to run now. How's Dad? There's been a lot of improvement. At least, he eats better now but still in bed. You know how it is. I'm sorry I cannot send money for his medication this week. Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't worry about that. We're fine. At the end of it all, we will all be fine. And don't you ever forget this; I love you. I love you too, Mom. Now, I have to run. Do take care of yourself. Bye. What are you even feeding her? Same damn thing I eat. I should've warned you better. It's not your fault. You told me he was trouble, and I just wasn't listening. He got arrested the other day. Burglary. He tried to steal from a cop's house. How dumb! How you holding up? You know. No, I don't know. It is what it is. I quit the restaurant though. I took your advice. I'm sure that drove Mimi crazy! She's still calling! I miss Murphy, though. Murphy... I'm still trying to figure out what I'm gonna do. There's a family looking for a babysitter. I know them very well. If I vouch for you, you can have the job. - But... - Don't worry about papers. Thank you very much. It's the least I can do. Hmm, you know, I've been doing some mental healing and praying myself. Like, full-on religion? Nah. Just, you know, creating a closer relationship with God. Putting my heart and my mind at peace. There's just too much anger inside. I've already hit rock bottom. I ain't got nothing to lose.
