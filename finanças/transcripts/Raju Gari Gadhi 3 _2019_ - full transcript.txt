Do you know anything about this? No. we don’t. During the 18th century, I love you... He used the words ‘I love you’ quite frequently One day, George Williams was officially transferred to Kerala. When he got here, his attention immediately He did not know that Devayani was the daughter But soon, Marthandavarma realised that with George Williams And so, he decided to use all his mystic powers It had been passed down from his forefathers, He had unearthed a powerful spell called Yakshi spell, On the day of a full moon... he began to perform the pooja to cast He invited the spirit Yakshi he guided the spirit of Yakshi into a doll Hey, Devayani... I love you As soon as these words were spoken, After the mystic got rid of George Williams, and buried it in some remote corner of his house. Holy one, we have a doll that resembles this in our house. That spirit is still active Where did you find that doll? Once, a real estate agent requested that Holy one, why are you digging? If you want me to get rid of that evil spirit... we have to bury four bronze objects at Doll? Why would this doll have a nail stuck to it? Ever since you removed the nail on that doll’s head... that spirit has been guarding your daughter. With that nail, you nailed your own coffin! Holy one, what if we throw that doll away in the ocean? Even if the doll is drowned in the ocean that spirit will not leave your daughter alone. We have to perform a pooja and give it an offering This ceremony should be conducted we require a bachelor for this ceremony.` In worst case scenario, he might The bachelor should be well prepared for it. Please listen to me.... Stay. May you be blessed with good fortune! May you be blessed with good fortune! Where are you going, young man? He wants to go Ashwin, why are you scared when I am with you?

But the other spirits that exist in the Oh God! They told us that it’s a ritual Uncle, That is exactly the reason why Holy one, start the ritual. Ashwin! What? Don’t be scared.
