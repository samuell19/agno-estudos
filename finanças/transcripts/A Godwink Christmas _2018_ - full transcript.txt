Godwink: An event or personal experience, often identified as coincidence so astonishing that it is seen as a sign of divine intervention, especially when perceived as the answer to a prayer. Hey Paula, can I grab you real quick? Yeah. What's up? We're on deadline to get the McHenry Auction Catalogue on the site. I'm still not sure about this lamp. Well, what does Mrs. McHenry say? She says it's a real Emily. The family story goes that her Great Grandmother got it for a wedding present back East. Somehow, made the trip to St. Louis in one piece. Well, colour looks good. Nice patina on the brass. You hear that? Is it broken? They used to use wax to hold the panels together, as they wax dries over the years the panels loosen. If it didn't rattle, you'd know the lamp was a fake. So, rattling's good. Yep. You can tell Mrs. McHenry that her Great Grandmother got a very nice wedding present. Thanks. Aunt Jane! Hey, how is my favourite niece doing this evening? She's trying to figure out how to make room for all of her Christmas decorations. Yeah, well your places looks more festive every year, I wish I was there to help you, honey. Me too. Wait, is that the harbour I'm hearing? You've come up for air from your writing desk? Is that a good sign!? It's a very good sign! You finished your book! I did, I did! And I wanted you to be the first to know. That's amazing, congratulations. Thanks so much, I just sent it off to my editor and I'm sure she'll have some things to say about it but I feel really hopeful. I'm sure it's gonna be wonderful. When do I get to read it!? Gee, that's actually why I'm calling you, I'm trying to tempt you to come to Nantucket. So beautiful with the holidays coming and, I don't know, you can read it while you stay at my house? I wish. I'm up to my neck in this McHenry Auction. You can bring Daniel, I mean when was the last time you two got away? Too long. Yeah, exactly. So, come, come see me. I'll speak to Daniel. Good! You do that and call me back, okay? You alright? Yeah... I'm good. Okay, I love you sweet stuff. I love you. Buh-bye. Daniel, hi. Hey. Sorry your assistant said you were just finishing up in here? You didn't get my message? Really? You really should check your phone more often. Well, if I check my phone then I know you were cancelling and then I would never come here and then I'd never get a chance to see you. That makes sense. So what's on the docket that's so important Mr. Counsellor? I got slammed with this Hodges case- I still have a dozen depositions to schedule assuming their lawyer doesn't ask for another continuance. Which is way too much information. Just a... I really am sorry about lunch. Well, can I at least take you for coffee? We can go downstairs, won't even have to take you out into the snow. There's snow outside? You... So, Aunt Jane finally finished her book. She was wondering if we could make it to Nantucket before the holidays so I could read it. Can't she just email us a copy? Kind of missing the point. Come on, you, me, Nantucket, romantic getaway. No, I get it. But the way this case is looking I'm gonna be working weekends right up to the holidays. And don't you have the McHenry Auction to prep? Yeah, but I feel like you've been working so hard you could use the break. We both could. Believe me, I know. I gotta say Gery, Christmas has become a whole lot more festive around here since you bought this place. It's a labour of love. I hope you worked up an appetite. Today I got a big pot of lentil and chestnut soup on the stove. Sounds perfect. What do ya think? It's beautiful! Yeah. It's starting to feel a little bit like Christmas. Ho-ho-ho! So, how's the cherub festival prep going? Well, we still got a long way to go to get the youth centre ready and Christmas is just around the corner. You and that Christmas spirit of yours will get it done. You always do. So... what're you gonna do for Christmas? Well, after the cherub festival I guess I'll just be back here looking after the place. You should come over to the house. Join us for dinner. Dorothy, that's sweet but your... Your family's gonna be there and you're gonna need a break from this place. Christmas is about being with them. Christmas is about being with the people that we care about and that includes you. No one should be alone for Christmas, especially after a divorce. I know. But I'll be fine. Well, the offer's still open if you change your mind. Thank you. So, I found this open store front that would actually be perfect for a little antique shop. I thought you decided not to open a shop a while ago. Well I did, it's just the bakery on Jefferson closed down so- Well, you know how impractical those little shops are and most of them don't even make it past the first year. I know, I just- I thought you liked working at the auction house? Well I do, but, sometimes I feel like I spend all my time reviewing reports and doing inventories on these huge estate sales and it feels more like I'm in a factory than anything else. Weren't they talking about moving you up? You'd have your own department to run. It'd be like owning your own place but you wouldn't have to build it from the ground up. I'm just gonna go look at it. Alright. Let me know how it goes. What time are your parents coming over for dinner tonight? I was thinking about that and I don't want you to have to spend the whole night cooking. So, I made reservations. What? Yeah, my parents only come into town once or twice a year and they'd much rather spend the evening talking versus watching us run back and forth to the kitchen. The office really can't live without you, can they? That was me. I'm sorr... You set an alarm? I will pick you up at 7:00. My parents and sister will meet us there. There they are. We were beginning to wonder what happened to you two. Sorry everybody, it's my fault. Got held up at the office. My big brother working late, what are the odds? Sis, how you doin'? I'm hungry. Merry Christmas, Katherine. Merry Christmas. Paula, seems like forever. It's good to see you, Robert. You look beautiful, Paula. Thank you, so do you. I really need to talk to you. Later. Yeah, sure. Welcome. Cheers everyone. Cheers. Need any help? No, I'm good, thank you. Just finishing up. Great. Then you can help me fold the rest of these napkins. I'm not sure I should be enabling this little napkin obsession of yours. It's festive. I tell you what, if you fold 30 of them, I'll tell you what tomorrow's soup is before I go? Deal. If I could have everyone's attention, please. As you all know, if there's one thing that Paula likes more than Christmas and antiques, it is cooking. And when Paula cooks, she really, really cooks. Stop! So, I decided to have dinner here to make sure that I could have her undivided attention when the time was right. Paula, when I first met you, something told me that you were the girl of my dreams. And after these years together I'm sure of it. I can't think of a better Christmas gift than to know that we'll spend every Christmas together from now on. Paula, will you marry me? Yes. Yes! I'm getting married! We need some champagne. Congratulations! Thanks Dad, thank you, thank you. You've been quiet. I think I'm still in shock. Can I take that as a good thing? Yeah. So, you're gonna turn this place into a winter wonderland. Well, Christmas is coming. No kidding. Okay, Mr. Scrooge, I thought you were looking forward to all the Christmases we'd be spending together once we were married? Absolutely. I just don't know if there's room for all this holiday cheer. What do you mean!? Well, my place is a lot smaller so it's gonna be a pretty tight squeeze when you move in. When did we decide that? Just makes sense. Well, I - I thought that we would look for a place of our own, together. Well, we'll be buying at the top of the market so financially speaking it makes a lot more sense to sell this place and move into mine. What you just said that your place is a lot smaller. Paula, I can't move out here. The commute would be insane. It would be insane for me too. But you wouldn't have to keep working. It's not a matter of have to, it's because I want to. No, of course not. It's about stories. It's about our personal histories and how these things take on a life of their own. It's a memory of a time where a person, that really means something. That's why you wanted your own shop? Yeah. Let's just... take one thing at a time. I'm sorry, I did not mean to... this is not how I wanted tonight to end. Clearly, we have some things to talk about before the big day. But what happens is that we love each other. And the rest, like you said it's just, it's one step at a time. Okay? Okay. Hey! Hey Aunt Jane. I wanted to give you the good news. Daniel asked me to marry him. That's fantastic! Congratulations! Yeah, it really took me by surprise. Well, those don't sound like happy tears? I don't feel like it either and I'm trying to figure out why. I just wasn't expecting this. Okay, you and I are gonna figure this out together, okay? I'm going online right now and I'm gonna get you a plane ticket. Come stay with me, we'll laugh, we'll cry and I'll listen to you. For as long as you need me to about anything you want to talk about, okay? Okay. Okay, I'll forward the flight information to you right now. Thank you. You're welcome, I love you, I can't wait to see ya! Me too. I'll keep you in my prayers, honey. See you soon! Bye. Jenn, hi! Hi. I'm sorry about just dropping in on you like this. I thought I'd catch you before work. No, it's fine, I... Sorry we didn't get a chance to talk yesterday with- - Everything that was going on. Totally, I get it. Are you going somewhere? That, yeah, no I was just gonna take a trip to visit my aunt in Nantucket. It's like a last-minute thing. You're not wearing your engagement ring? Yeah, I'm just, I'm still, you know, trying to get used to it. He really threw you a curve, didn't he? Yeah. You could say that. I guess I always thought we would talk about getting married but recently it seems like when Daniel makes his mind up about something, that's it. You didn't come here to talk about me, I'm sorry. What's going on? Please, come in. Well, I have been looking for a job this summer and Daniel pulled some strings and got me a really great job at a really good law firm. It's a great opportunity. But? I'm just not sure that's what I want to do. A friend of mine works for a marine biology boat down in Florida. They save marine life and help preserve coral reefs and she said a crew position might be opening up. But how much do you know about marine life and coral reefs? Not a thing. Well, I mean it's a lot different than working in a law firm. It is. But I'd actually get to see the world, before I figured out what it is, I wanna do with my life. So, what should I do? Well, you need to have a conversation with Daniel and tell him how you honestly feel. Like how you're gonna tell him? Mine and Daniel's relationship isn't going to change over the weekend. And right now, I'm just looking forward to spending some time with my aunt, she... she has a way of seeing things more clearly. You focus on you and we'll talk when I get back, okay? Thanks. Come here. Welcome to Charlotte Inn, folks. So why don't you go on in inside and get you checked in in just a minute. Hey, Vern said that package that you ordered came in a day early on this mornings' flight. That's great. I'll swing by later and pick it up. I'll let him know. Thanks Buddy. There's my girl! Hi! So good to see you. It's good to see you. What a weekend I've got planned for us! Walks, fires, food, lots and lots of antique. That sounds... great. Just a little bit of bad news though with the good. It's not about your book, is it? No, everything's fine. My editor called though and she needs to talk with me about the manuscript because the publishers want to put it out a little earlier so that's good. Okay, well don't worry about me. No, no, no, you're not gonna sit around and watch me work, are you kidding!? I promised you a great weekend and I'm gonna give you a great weekend. What's this? Well I was going to surprise you and go to Martha's Vineyard with you but just because I can't go doesn't mean you shouldn't go. Well, I mean I-I-I've never been to Martha's Vineyard. You're gonna love it! And Edgartown has some of the best antique shops anywhere and you're not even gonna miss me you, you're gonna be so engrossed in all of them. Well, I... Yes is the word you're looking for! Okay. And you're booked on the last flight back so, I'll have a great dinner waiting for you, I'll take your bag home with me. Okay. Alright, this is me saying goodbye. Bye. Go spend money. Okay. Retail therapy, like I taught you. Bye. It's for a good cause. If you're gonna be on the island for the holidays. I'm not but thank you. You bet. Good to see you again. How are the kids? Hi. Hi. Hi. Do you think you could take me into town? Sure thing. Where you headed? Edgartown. I heard there's some good antiquing there? Good choice. Hop in. Thank you. Okay. Sorry, it... Hang on a sec. Hey, Kenny. Did Stacie get my notes on the grading report? Thank you. Pardon me. Hey Buddy, everything okay? I don't know, this thing never breaks down. Well, let's take a look here. Okay. Bye. You need a new starter, maybe? Hi! Hey. I'm sorry about this, ma'am. Should I get another cab? Well, if you can find one. Keep pretty busy this time of year. Gery, you know she's just heading into Edgartown. Would you mind giving her a lift? Oh, no I couldn't. I'm headed that way anyway. And this might take a while. Are you sure? Is it no trouble? It's no trouble at all. As long as you don't mind making a quick stop on the way. Sure yeah, no problem. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Hey, no problem. Gery Conover. Paula Mayor. Nice to meet you, Paula Mayor. First time on the island? I'm just here for the day, I... my aunt was supposed to be here she's in Nantucket but something came up, so, here I am. Well, Christmas is a pretty special time a year around here. Oh yeah? How long have you lived here? Well, only about three years. But it already feels like home. Especially around the holidays. Christmas has a way of doing that, you know. No matter where you are it just... gives you a sense of home. That's right. Thank you, again, for the ride. This is quite the car. It belonged to my Grandfather. He bought it brand new. Right off the show room floor. It still looks brand new. It's one of my favourite things to do, looking after this old beauty. Are you okay if we stop by the Youth Centre? Oh, yeah. It'll only take a second. No problem. I bet you didn't know you'd be seeing the vineyard in a genuine Detroit classic? No, I, did not. Lucky me. Actually, this got here a day early so you really are lucky. Well, it's all in the timing. That is what they say. Ooh, look at all of this! Hey Gery, did you bring them? She's so excited. Hi Katie, you better believe I did. Who's that? This is Paula. She's visiting the island for her very first time. Hi. Come see the baskets. They're the best ones ever. Oh my gosh, those are the best ones ever. They're so good, the kids are gonna love them. And, look what I got. Those are the cutest. Yeah, they sure are. There's more on the way. This friend of mine from the Mainland donated a bunch for the kids. And we get to decorate them anyway we want. You know, when I was your age, my mom used to call me the Christmas decorating queen, 'cause I would cover the house in homemade decorations. Mine taught me how to make snowflakes yesterday. Right mom? That's right, sweetie. That is a great cameo brooch. Thank you. My Grandmother gave it to me ages ago. It was really popular in the '30's. If you ever want to clean it, just use a little white toothpaste with a soft brush over the white shell and it will brighten it right up. Really? Toothpaste... I had no idea. Cherub Christmas festival. I've been seeing these all of the airport. Yeah, we have Gery to thank for that. He handles all the fundraising, among other things. No, everyone pitches in to make it happen. Well, it seems like everybody's really into it. Yes! And we're keeping you from your antique shops. So, we're gonna go. I'll be back later. Okay. It's nice to meet you, Katie. Are you sure I can't just drop you at the shops? No, no, I've put you out of your way enough, I can just walk from here. This is beautiful! It's like a Christmas card. Yeah, the house was actually built in 1866. It belonged to a whaling-ship owner and then in 1934, Charlotte Pent bought it and turned it into an inn. The Charlotte Inn. You're quick. Unfortunately she was unable to keep up with the repairs and it kind of fell apart and then about three years ago, it was completely renovated to its original beauty. You sure know a lot about it. Yeah, I did the renovations. You work here? Technically I own the place but yeah, you could say that my work is never done. You, you sure have a talent for restoring things. I don't know about talent, but I definitely enjoy it. Something kind of special about breathing new life into old things. Yeah. It's a way to thank those who took care of the things before us and a way to pass them along to whoever will care for them after us. That's right. Antiques. Of course, yeah you just shoot right back down this road, take a right at the sign and- Hi Gery! Who's your friend? Dorothy, this is Paula. She's visiting the island. Hi. Hi, welcome. Thank you. This is the best time of year to be staying with us. You'll love it. I'm not staying here I'm just... here for the day. Well why don't you come in and have a look around? I just finished preparing my soup of the day. I'd love to but I don't wanna be a burden, I should- Nonsense. I'm told I make the best soup outside of Santa's Workshop. You're gonna have to eat eventually, right? Yeah. Eventually. Then it's settled. Settled. Settled. I'm just- I'll make a quick phone call and I'll meet ya inside. Sounds good. Hey, Paula, I'm sorry I can't talk right now, this Hodges case just blew up in our faces. I may have to fly to New York. That's sorry, I... I... I will call you as soon as I can. Okay, yeah. That's fine. Love you. Bye. I guess. I grew up in St. Louis. My mom worked in the main branch as a librarian it was one of those, big old buildings they used to make, you know, the kind that you would just get lost in all of the books. It sounds great. I used to spend hours just exploring the shelves. And you still live in St. Louis? Yeah, I moved back after I graduated with no idea what was next. I mean, what do you do with a history degree. I guess that depends on what got you interested in the first place? I always had this fascination with different times. You know? How people lived, what they thought, what they loved. I'm assuming that's why you're interested in antiques. Probably, yeah. When I moved back I looked into teaching... research. No, no I don't see that for you. Says the man who's known me for what, two hours now? No, I could see you in a museum. Why do you say that? Betsy's brooch. The second you looked at it, you knew exactly what it was. Okay... I work in an auction house. There it is. I spend most of my time finding out whether or not antiques are real. I was pretty close. Close... ish. I should get going. Yeah. I'll walk you to the door. Okay. I'm happy that you stayed. It was nice. Thank you. The whole place, you've really done a wonderful job with it. Thank you. Are you sure I can't give you a lift to the antique shops? No, no, honestly, it's such a short walk. Anyway, good luck with your antiquing and whatnot. Yes. You know where you're headed? If I don't, I'll just call Buddy to pick me up. Great. Well, if I don't see you, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'll get the door. Take care. Bye. Hi. Hi. Can I help you find something? I'm just looking around. You have a really lovely shop here. Thank you. I've got a little bit of everything, I guess. A friend of mine has a place just like this. It's packed to the brim, I think I've lost days in there helping her catalogue. Well, it seems like you know your stuff. Well, I dabble. Must be fun having a store like this. It has its ups and downs. There's definitely never a dull moment. Let me know if you see something you like. Haggling is an old and cherished tradition around here. Good... to... know. I can hear ya thinking from the kitchen, Gery. It's just the decorating for the festival this weekend. I want there to be something, I don't know, special for everyone. You know something to get their holiday spirits racing. I just can't put my finger on what's missing. Looked like ya made a new friend. Paula? No, she's just in town for the day, antiquing, headed back home to St. Louis very soon. Shame you're so busy. Looked like you two really hit it off. Yeah. No, I mean, but you know, never stops. Well, it's the holidays. Make sure you take some time to enjoy. Indeed. This is a great place. Thank you. There are two other shops down the road that have some nicely curated selections as well. They're the oldest stores on the island. Well thanks. And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. You don't happen to know if this Currier and Ives print is an original, do you? Those just came in this morning, I haven't even had a chance to look. It's in wonderful condition. I've had a few of them come through here, they usually get bought up right away. About 75 percent of the Currier and Ives images families bring in are knock-offs but some of them are pretty good, they can fool you. Really? What gives them away? Well, the thickness of the paper but it's hard to tell when they're in the frame. You can take it out, if you like. You sure? Please, be my guest, you've got me all curious now. Okay. Sorry. Speaking of work, I just, gotta take this. Hi, Kenny, everything okay? One of the McHenry's doesn't want us to include the estate jewellery anymore. Can you hold on a sec? My advice would be to just check it out first before you put a price tag on it. Okay thank you very much. Yeah. Bye. Bye. Kenny. Hey Buddy, what's up? I don't know. I don't know, it just won't start. ...what do you think? And how goes the antiquing? I've actually only got the chance to look into one store so far, Past and Presents. That's nice. Yeah. Susanna's only had it about a year. She's still trying to make a go of it. Yeah, it can be tricky, having your own shop's a... lot of balls to juggle. Free cider for you? Is that the voice of experience I'm hearing. No. I mean not yet. That is. I've looked into having my own shop but- I even found a store front. So, what's stopping you? It's not something you can just sort of jump into. That's what they told me when I bought the Inn. I like my job at the auction house. But sometimes I think I might be a little too sentimental with this line of work. What's wrong with that? Well, families bring in their treasured heirlooms, passed on from generation to generation and I've been known to talk them out of selling. That can't be good for business. No, but, yeah. Well, you know, some things are more important than money. Yeah. You know it's a shame you're only staying for the day. There's so many things to see here. The lighthouses, South Beach, the carousel. There's a carousel? Yeah. It's the most summertime attraction. It's just outside of Tisbury. Paula? Sorry, the- That was my mom's favourite Christmas carol. We used to sing it all the time on the way home from Christmas service. It's... I should get to the airport. Yes, I can give you a lift, if you like? Well, thank you... again. Okay. Well, I guess this is good-bye. Again. You know, unless Buddy's cab breaks down in front of the airplane. Or you're expecting another package. - Yeah, no. - No. It was nice to meet you, Paula. It's nice to meet you too, Gery. - See ya. - Bye. Ladies and gentlemen, due to severe fog conditions in Nantucket, all flights have been cancelled. Please see agent for re-booking tomorrow. Fog? I heard it on the radio. Yeah. They said Nantucket's never seen such a heavy fog for this time of year. Whatever it is, all flights are cancelled until tomorrow. I'm staying at the Charlotte Inn. The Charlotte. That place is booked up months in advance for the holidays. Yeah, their main house is booked but I guess I got lucky they had a last-minute cancellation in the carriage house. That's a little more than luck sweetheart! People reserve the carriage house like a year in advance. How'd it go with your editor? It was great. I'll tell you all about it when you get back. Okay. They haven't mentioned when they're gonna open the airport again but when they do I'll be on the first flight back tomorrow. Okay, well just text me alright, I'll... I'll pick you up. Okay. Love you. Alright, be safe. Hi. Hey. I brought you a toothbrush and some other things I thought you might need, since you weren't planning on staying. That is... that's so sweet of you, thank you. Just make yourself comfortable and if there's anything else you need, just let me know. Okay. We serve dinner until 9:00. In case you're interested. Yeah, well actually, you wouldn't happen to have any of that soup left over from lunch, would you? I'll see what I can do. Okay. Enjoy. Yeah. Excuse me. Hey! Hi. How's the room? Perfect. Good. Yeah. What's going on in here? We do this every year, it's just a little holiday cheer before we walk down for the Christmas tree lighting. Christmas tree lighting? That's right. Down at the waterfront, a bunch of people gather round, there's carols and lights, it's fun. Nice. Hey Gery! Could you excuse me, for one sec? Yeah. Hey Paula! Hi. Look. Nice work. I think it'll be an antique one day. Well, I think that maybe you should sign your name because when it does become an antique, people will know who did it. Okay. Hey, Katie, can I see? Hi, Paula. So, you gonna come to the tree lighting with us? I'll give you a cookie if you come? Sold! It'll be fun. Come on, I'll introduce you to everyone. Okay. So we've done it every year as a thank you to the community. One of my favourite Christmas traditions is when families would make their own Christmas ornaments to hang on the tree. You mean like fur on strings and paper chains? They'd use all kinds of things like, branches or pinecones or, corn husks. You know. The point is they would make it with their hands. Hey you two, what's up? Well, just... makin' stars. That would be nice to do at the store. Where'd you learn to do that? My mom showed me. Her dad showed her, it's sort of been a family tradition that's gotten passed down. Well, ain't that something. Merry Christmas. That's it. That's it, that's what we do. That's what's missing, the old-fashioned ornament, old Christmas traditions. An old-fashioned cherub festival. Yeah. I love it. Best part is, we don't have to ship anything in from the Mainland. Everything we need is right here on the island. It's easy. Yeah, seems easy. Buddy may need a few more lessons. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the tree lighting. Here we go. Buckle up. Okay. Is everyone ready to light this tree? Here we go. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! You're just... Appreciate the lesson in 'old-fashioned' decorating. What're ya building over there? A pinecone. Okay. A little bit of white paint. Okay. An old canning jar. I like it. Voila! No way. It's a snow globe. My mom taught me how to make these too. She was always the best at making the most of Christmas. I noticed Susanna had a bunch of old canning jars in her shop. Perfect. I'll pick those up tomorrow. How're you doing over there? Very well actually. Thank you, couldn't be better. Is this supposed to look like that? You build stuff, right? Yeah, but not out of sticks. You make it look so easy. It looks great. So, three years in Martha's Vineyard, what about before then? Boy, okay. I grew up in Philadelphia, huge Philly's fan. You're kidding? What? I went to the University of Pennsylvania. So did I. What? We could've passed each other every day and not even known it. Okay. After graduating, I mean Martha's Vineyard is a long ways away from Philadelphia? It's also a long story. And complicated. Hey, can I buy you a hot chocolate? Sure. Good. You know it's funny, people always talk about how beautiful this place is but they always end up missing all the little things. Like fog horns? Like fog horns. And how seeing things a different way can change the way you look at them. I saw this, my first night on the island. Now it wasn't Christmas but all the lights on the waterfront at night, just kind of made me feel like everything would be okay. So, you stayed. Yeah. Like I found another piece of my puzzle. It's too bad you can't stay for the festival. Yeah... Maybe next year. Yeah. Brought ya some coffee. You're an angel. Thanks, Dorothy. So the fog in Nantucket has lifted. Yup. They're reopening the airport. That's good. Well, she hasn't left yet, you know. What? She was up early this morning, asked me to call her a cab. Where to? I brought ya a coffee. It's pretty cold up here this time of year. You came prepared. Thank you. When I told you about the carousel, I forgot to mention that it's closed for the winter. That's okay. I was just curious. Well, maybe your Christmas wish should be that it's open. Or maybe I just have really bad timing. When I was a little girl, they would always set up this winter wonderland during the holidays. I thought it was so magical, they had these lights, decorations, this enormous Christmas tree. But my favourite part... was the Christmas carousel. Every Christmas Eve, my mom and I would ride it together. We always picked the same two horses, Dancer and Prancer. Because we pretended they were reindeer. We would even bring little scarves to wrap around their necks to keep them warm it was... silly. But it was wonderful. That was Christmas to me. What about now? My mom passed away two years ago. I haven't been to a carousel since. I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I don't know, maybe I just want you to know something about me, something I don't usually tell people. Thank you. Yeah. They reopened the airport. Guess you got a flight to catch. Yeah. I have no service up here so I can't check in. You can use the computer in my office. Ok. We should go. Yeah. Thank you. And there you are, I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything. Thanks, this shouldn't take too long. Okay. Yes, we got some of what you're looking for right on the shelf. Good morning. Paula. Good morning. I didn't think I'd see you again so soon. Yeah, I was just curious If you had found out anything about the Currier and Ives print? Actually, I reached out to some people and I went on the internet. Here, have a look. Okay. I remember what you were saying about the thickness of the paper so I took it out of the frame. Tell me what you think. Well, it feels good. One other way you can tell is by the pigment. Yeah, I was reading that the originals were all individually hand-coloured. If you look close enough, I think that those are brush strokes. I don't know, I could be wrong. Not at all. This is one of the best I've ever seen. I was hoping that you would say that. I would like to buy it. Really? Yeah, actually I'm getting on a plane shortly, would you mind putting it in a frame for me and having it delivered? Absolutely. But, only if you let me give you a 25 percent discount. I've been so busy trying to sell the store that I doubt I would have even had time to check if it wasn't for you. You're thinking of selling the store? Yeah, it's only been a year but I just don't have the passion for antiques that someone needs to keep a place like this running. Yeah. Yeah, it's a, it's a lot for sure. And that is why I appreciate someone like you who does. Okay, I will have this delivered later today. Actually... Could you have that delivered tomorrow? Sure, no problem. So, what is the address? We went for a walk last night. Yeah. And the way the Christmas lights sparkled off the water was... so beautiful. He wanted me to stay. Ah-ha. And did you want to stay? Yeah. No. I don't know. I didn't tell him that I was engaged. Well, you're not wearing your ring. Are you still engaged to Daniel, honey? I love Daniel, I do. He asked me to marry him and I said yes. I know what you need right now. You need a great walk, with a fabulous aunt. And I happen to know one personally. Come on, lets get some fresh air. It wasn't easy moving away from home and leaving you and your mom. But when I married your Uncle Mike, we made a promise to one another. So, when he got the job offered to come here to Nantucket, well, it was like a big ol' leap of faith for us. I know how much you miss him. Every day. But you know what, when things like that happen, big things like moving across the country. You know it's important to try to see things in a different light. What do you mean? Well, sometimes God does not speak to us in a voice that we can hear. Sometimes, God winks. Mom always talked about Godwinks. Yeah, well, we grew up that way. We knew that when things happened to us that we didn't understand, it was really a way of getting our attention and moving us, guiding us, onto the right path, you know? A better one. So, you think everything that happened this weekend is... God winking at me? How many things had to happen in just the right ways at just the right time? So that you and Gery could get to know each other. It's kind of miraculous. So, what am I supposed to do now? Just, call off the engagement? Only you can figure out what happens next, honey and it's not going to happen here. It's gotta happen right here. In that beautiful heart of yours. Listen to it, it will tell you. I love you. I love you. So big. Remember when your mom used to say I love you so big? Alrighty, I'm going to go home, start supper, you comin'? I'm just going to just hang back here for a little bit. Okay. Listen to that heart of yours, honey. Paula, will you see who that is, please? I got scones in the oven. Daniel! Hi, Paula. Come in. Thanks. What are you doing here? I thought I'd come surprise ya. Yeah... I have a meeting tomorrow in New York, so I took an earlier flight, so I could see ya. That is so sweet. Look what the tide dragged in. Big guy, how are ya? It's really good to see you. You too. I hear congratulations are in order? Yeah, thanks, once she got over the shock of it she said yes. Yes, and your timing is impeccable. Yeah, I just got some scones out of the oven and if you're interested, I think I could rustle up a little of that strawberry jam of mine. Yum, lead the way. Come on over. So, Paula tells me I should be congratulating you too, Jane. You finished your book? Yeah, I sure did. I was going over some notes today with my editor. It sounds like it went really well. It did, sweetie, thank you, yeah. They're planning on putting it out in the new year so that's great. Well, here's to hoping that next Summer, people are reading your book up and down the beach. Thank you so much, from your lips to Gods ears. Two minutes, I promise. Hey! He'll be right back. So catch me up on where we're at, okay? I gotta get ready for church. No, no... What's that? That... is a snow globe. It doesn't look like a snow globe. All it needs is a little Christmas magic. Hey, Gery? Where do you want these? Right here. Perfect. Buddy, pinecones. Lots and lots of pinecones. Okay, I'm on it. Hey! I thought you'd be out and about, looking at all the decorations by now? Yeah, Daniel's just had call after call. Yeah. You alright? Yeah. Yeah, I am. I can't believe he came all the way out here to surprise me. He used to do things like that all the time. I think I just... I've realized how much I miss that. I bet you do. Well you know what tonight is, Nantucket Christmas stroll. It's the highlight of the entire holiday season. Everybody's gonna be out looking at the shops and the lights and all the decorations. You two need a romantic night together, you need to go. I will talk to Daniel but that sounds nice. Doesn't it? So, does a cup of tea. Yes. What do you think? Love it. Yeah, so the idea is people can try their hand at the various vintage crafts. Well now isn't that lovely. You hang these on a tree, Christmas spirit like you wouldn't believe. And we help raise money for the youth centre. That's wonderful, Gery. Paula, actually gave me the idea. Yeah, it is pretty wonderful, isn't it? I almost forgot. Susanna dropped this off for you. What is it? I thought you'd know? I didn't buy anything. Well, would you look at that. It's from the same series. These Christmas prints were the most popular things they did. I've seen pictures of this one but never an actual print. Who's it from? Good question. I really am sorry about all those calls, this meeting. No. It's important, I get it. Not as important as you. I want you to know that. There's just so much that I want for us, Paula. Daniel, just this, here, us alone, I can't remember the last time that that has happened. That is nice. Speaking of which. Yeah. That's a keeper. You're not wearing your engagement ring? Is something wrong with it? What, no. No... no, of course not. Then why aren't you wearing it? I... I just. This all happened so fast. We didn't even talk about it. I guess I was just... Need a little bit more time to... Get used to it. I... I'm sorry is there something I'm missing here? Two years we've been together and you weren't ready yet? Daniel, I haven't been wearing the ring the entire time that you've been here and this is the first time that you've noticed it. Which means what? I don't know. That's the problem, I just... I feel like we are out of sync, like we don't know each other the way that we used to. I'm sorry. I didn't want to do this tonight, I just wanted us to enjoy this. I... I'm sorry too. I, you know, I've gotta be up early in the morning, I should probably get out of here. But look, you stay. Enjoy the rest of this. Daniel... You're up early. Daniel left about an hour ago. Okay. And how are you feeling about that? I've been sitting here asking myself the same question. Honey, I've known you your whole life and you have never rushed into a decision. But when you make up your mind, in here, you know it. Yeah, I'm just... pretty confused as to what's going on in here right now. I know. I know you are but you're going to be okay. I'm here for you. I don't know what I would do without you. I don't either. You'd be lost. Just like I would too. I love you baby girl. So much. I should get back. Yes, you should, you have a plane to catch. Yeah. Go. You know you're beautiful, right? You know you look just like your Mother. Stop. No, I'm not gonna stop, get outta here. Susanna. Hi, Gery. Did you get the package that I left with Dorothy? That's actually why I'm here. It's a beautiful print, isn't it? Original Currier and Ives, hand-painted. It is, except I didn't order it. I just assumed it was an early Christmas present. From whom? She didn't tell you? Excuse me. Hello? Are you still in Nantucket? Gery? You haven't left yet, have you? You're still in Nantucket? No... I mean yeah, I'm just about to board. Can you stay, for a bit? Just for a bit, please. No, I-I have to go. No, I know but... not yet. Please. I'm sorry I... I can be there in one hour. What? This is... This is crazy, what do you mean? There's another flight in a couple of hours. What difference is a couple of hours going to make? I don't know. Maybe nothing, but isn't it worth finding out? Paula, please. Okay, hurry up. Okay. You asked me a question... that I didn't answer. Right, when I asked you how you got to the vineyard from Philadelphia. Yeah. When I was telling you about my Grandfather's car, what I didn't say is my grandparents raised me, and my Grandfather, there wasn't anything that he couldn't do with his hands, when it came to building and fixing things. Which is how you got so good at all the renovations. I got pretty good. But, I felt like I should also cover my bases. So, I studied finance and money management. You know, I had a good job waiting for me when I graduated and then about three years later, I got married. You were married? I mean, that first year we were, we were really happy. What happened? What happened was, I woke up one morning and I realized how much I missed working with my hands. And then one day I was walking down the street and I looked in the store window and I saw this print. A Currier and Ives Christmas print. The one in your office. And I thought well that wouldn't be so bad, would it? Living in a place where people take the time to appreciate something like a snowy park on a Christmas day. You um... you bought the Inn because of a print you saw on the window? I guess that's what it comes down to, yeah. You know weird thing is I lived in Philly my whole life. Never seen that shop. I'd never even been on that street. And when I saw that print, I felt like I had found a missing piece of my puzzle. What about your wife? She came, for a while, stuck it out but she ultimately wanted to live in the big city and I knew in my heart that that would never make me happy. So, we signed divorce papers at the beginning of the year. I'm sorry. I- Which is... it's not what I came here to say. When I saw that print that you gave me, it was like I was right back on that street, looking into that store window. Except you were right there beside me. And it just felt right. I'm... I should have told you this when we met. I'm in a relationship. I'm engaged. Gery... No, no, no, it's okay. Look, you're an amazing, beautiful woman. And it only makes sense that somebody else found you first. I hope he knows how lucky he is. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Okay. Good morning. Hey, how was your trip? It was good. I put the appraisal report for the McHenry watches on your desk. And a box of books came in last minute. I went through most of it but I left a couple of piles on your desk that I wasn't sure about. Kenny, thank you. Welcome back. Daniel gets in late tonight from New York. So, what are the two of you doing for Christmas? I... I don't know, we actually haven't talked about it since he left Nantucket. Well, honey it's less than a week away. I know. I'm sure we'll probably just have a quiet holiday together, try to relax a little. Okay, well you know you're always welcome here, right? I know, thank you. You take care and I'll talk to you soon. Okay. Okay, bye-bye. How's your aunt? She's great. Yeah, it was good. I saw Daniel for a night. How was that? Good. Yeah. Was... great. You know, what you said to me the other day really helped. Just know yourself, know what you need to be happy and stick to it. It's true. You give good advice Paula. Well sometimes. How are you going there, Buddy? This isn't working. Alright. Try it again. You've got to take it slow, alright? You want to bend it just enough that... Not so easy, is it? I'm gonna go get some cider. Hey. Gery, that looks great, just like how Paula made it. I'll tell ya what... It's all yours, champ. Thank you. Is Paula coming to the festival? She had to leave. She's spending Christmas at home. I'm sorry she won't be here. I really liked her. Yeah. Me too. No, no, they already pushed the deposition back twice. Let me give you a call back. I didn't know you were coming by? I thought I'd surprise you this time. I was gonna call you last night. By the time I got in it was so late. No, it's okay, I know you're busy. I promise not to stay too long I just, I feel like... I, miss you. I miss you too. You know we haven't talked about Christmas yet? I know, what would you like to do? I was thinking that maybe we could invite Jenn over, if she doesn't have plans yet. Yeah, Jenn, you know she called me early this morning, telling me she was going to spend the holiday this year with a friend, in Florida. Well, at least the weather will be nice. This isn't funny, Paula, we're talking about my Sister's future. Yeah, you're right, her future. So, you really think it's okay for her to just walk away from a chance at a real career, which for the record, I had to call in a couple big favours to get for her. Well, I'm sure she knows that. Have you thought about asking her what she wants? Apparently, to sit in a boat in the middle of the ocean for weeks at a time. No Daniel, she just wants you to listen to her, to hear her. When I fell in love with you Daniel, you were the kindest person that I had ever met. People mattered to you. You cared. I still care. About work. And there's nothing wrong with that. But it's not what I want. You're a really good guy, Daniel. I'm sorry. I have to take this call, Paula. Hey Jim. Yeah, we already got the... Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah, I'll give him a call. Hey, Paula. Hey, is that invitation to Christmas still open? Are you serious? What about Daniel, sweetheart? I'll see you after the McHenry Auction. Okay, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Well, we'll do a little bit of both. Okay sweetie, I love you. I love you too. Bye. Hey. No, yeah, I know. But I think I've got a plan. Paula! Hi. It's so good to have you back, honey. How are you doin'? Better now. I just want you to relax and enjoy yourself, okay? As of this very moment, guess what? What? You're officially on holiday. But we're going to have to hurry because our plane is boarding right now. Wait, what? Where am I going? No, we, we, we are going to Martha's Vineyard. No, no, no, I just want to, hide under a blanket and read a book and drink cider. No, honey, the best remedy is to go out there and enjoy all the Christmas that you can grab in your hands. It's Martha's Vineyard though. Martha's Vineyard is where all the great antique shops are. We didn't get to make our memory last time. It's a big island. Everybody's going to be running around with last minute crazy Christmas stuff. We are too. Let's go. Come on. Before you change your mind, let's go. Thank you, Aunt Jane, this is really helping. Oh gosh, don't mention it, sweetie, I just want you to enjoy yourself. Look, you love those. I do. That's so sweet. You lookin' for something? No. No. Okay, let's go to Tisbury. It's the cutest little town, you're gonna love it. Lets grab a cab. Hi, are you available? Yes ma'am. Great, thank you. Hi, Paula. Hey, Buddy. Where are you two going? Tisbury please. Hop in. Paula? Yeah. We gotta go if we want to get there before dark. So, you fold the piece of paper like this and then you cut here, here and here. Okay just make sure that you squeeze the lid good and tight. See. Mom, look at my tree! That looks great! Let's take a look. Yes, please. Ah-ha. Well Gery, it looks like you did it again. I couldn't do it without you, Dorothy. You know that. It's nice, isn't it? Having everyone together like this. Yeah. ...Good for you. So, how was antiquing, find anything good? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. It was nice. What was that? Nothin'. Are you sure? Yeah, nothing to worry about,... Probably just the engine. Well, can you fix it? Sure, yeah, just gotta make a quick phone call. Oh, no. Buddy! Yeah, it broke down again. Hey. Don't-Get off the- get off the phone. Hold on. You know what, I can see town from here I think we should go for a cup of coffee while we wait. Don't be silly, he's gonna call a friend. No, I- I definitely think that we should go for a walk. Definitely. Wait, wait. It's my editor. What? Hello? Yes, yes, I'm here. Can you hear me? You know what, I'm gonna... I'm going by myself. Go, go! Yes. Hi! I hear you better over here. Yeah. First of all I want to thank you all for coming tonight I hope you're all having a good time. - Yes! Good, good. I'm thrilled to announce that between ticket sales and your donations, we have officially met our fundraising goal for the youth centre. You have given these children a truly wonderful Christmas present and to that I say, Merry Christmas to all, and to all, goodnight. Thanks. Now, go, enjoy yourselves. Have fun, it's a party. Gery, did you turn your phone off? What? No. Well, Buddy just called, says he's trying to get a hold of you. Where is he? I don't know. Give him a call. What's going on? Paula. Gery. Hi. Hi. Welcome back. What- I was in, Buddy's cab and then it, it, well broke down. So I, I saw the lights on the carousel but they're not supposed to be on, in the Winter. No, they're not. What are you doing here? I got a call that Buddy's cab had broken down... Again. I thought you were spending Christmas in St. Louis? Yeah, I was, I mean I did, I was I was supposed to. I just... turns out that's... not what I wanted at all. I think I was missing a piece of my puzzle too. His cab seems to be working just fine. Aunt Jane! Hi! We're so glad you made it, Paula. We were so afraid you were going to go straight to town. I'm sorry, you two know each other? Oh, honey, I've been antiquing here for years of course I picked up a friend or two along the way. Hi, Gery, it's so nice to meet you, I'm Jane. So, you two gals had something to do with this? Well, you know what, when God winks at two people they way he's been winking at the two of you, how could we not notice. You needed a little nudge. With the help of Buddy and his cab, of course. It was no problem. The carousel was a nice touch, by the way. Yeah, let's just say I was inspired. You? It took me a while to defrost the gears but it should be running like summertime. Well, maybe we should go back and enjoy the festival. Absolutely. But can't we just- No, we can't. Buddy. Merry Christmas you two. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Paula. Merry Christmas, Gery. It looks like I got my Christmas wish after all. I think we have time for a ride. Absolutely. Shall we?
