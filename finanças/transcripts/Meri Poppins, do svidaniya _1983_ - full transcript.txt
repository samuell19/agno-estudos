Karklinsh Director Leonid Kvinikhidze PART TWO "The Week Ends on Wednesday" Sir Lesley Lit, chief of the London fire-fighters, says... Quote: "To successfully combat fire... ... we need good organization and discipline." It is my duty to point out, sir, that the house was not equipped with fire-extinguishers, hooks or sand. How terrible! I'm afraid I have to charge you with a 10 pounds fine. It is your job, constable. I will pay by all means. And who will pay for my vehicle, sir? I represent "West-Mole Co." My assistant. I demand reimbursement for the damage done! The disruption of gas communications led to... ... cutting Cherry St. from gas supply. And that entailed grave consequences. - First of all, the fire. - But sir! Second, inflicting damages to the property of "West-Mole Co." ... estimated at 10 thousand pounds! - That's right, inspector. - 10 thousand pounds. Together with the repair works that amounts to 13500 pounds. You have to deposit the money before the end of the week. Any objections, sir? In your place, mister Banks, I would object! - You think so? - I'm positive! Well then, I do have objections. Your grounds, sir? What are our grounds? As Astute Bill would say: "Look for the reason". This monstrous machine with its horrible drill... ... made a hole in the gas pipe. And you, mister Banks, are not responsible for its actions! - That is quite true. - Objection overruled! A machine wouldn't start drilling all by itself. - But it did. - Yes! It was due to someone's stupid and criminal prank. You don't mean to say that me or my wife... I'm sorry. Mister Timothy Green from the Observer claims that... "Among the reasons causing fires primary is children's actions." And further-on I quote: "Playing with matches accounts for one third of all fires!" 300 years ago this danger did not exist in London. You do have children, mister Banks. And I can see they are left to their own devices. - And that is deplorable! - I object! You have no right to drag the children into your schemes! - Objection overruled. - Why? Because I have not the honor of knowing you, young man! My name is Robertson, and these children are my nephews. And I will sing you a song about poor hungry children, who will have no place to sleep because of your exorbitant bill! You, who know not mercy! Look what you're doing! You condemn these children to cold and hunger! Listen to me! What was it - Robertson? Do you have a song about the other children from Cherry St.? This morning they didn't get their warm milk and hot bath. - Objection! - Objection overruled! And I want to make a point, sir, that the London fire-fighters... ... perform certain special operations. Like pulling children's heads out of park grilles. And that happens more often than one would think, sir. 22 times a year, mister Banks! You are to deposit 13500 pounds by the end of the week. The week expires on Wednesday. Nice meeting you, sir! Cheer up, mister Banks. Not a bad rehearsal... in view of the coming ordeals. They will be here! Be sure! Children! Michael, Jane! Breakfast is ready! Mom, do I look like a fire-fighter? You look like a chimney-sweep. Robert, come inside! God, and these are my children! What did I do to deserve this? Jane, Michael, there's hot milk on the table. I don't want hot milk for breakfast! And I don't want a hot bath either! Well, you could wash your face and get dressed properly. - Why me? - You're the elder sister. And even at times like this you must set a good example. I'm tired of being the elder sister! I don't want to be! Let Michael be the older one for once! You are wrong, Jane. You think I want to be a grown man? Oh how I wish I could... ... be a little boy again, wearing short panties. Did you really wear short panties? Yes, I had short panties and long flaxen curls. We lived in a house on the seashore... ... and we had a wonderful kind nanny. Miss... Miss... My God, the telegram! I forgot all about it. That's terrible! Misfortunes never come singly. Take heart, dear. "Coming to stay for a month. Arriving 10 in the morning." "Be sure to heat up the bedroom fireplace. Euphimia Andrew." Wait. Wasn't that the name of your nanny? Yes. And she is coming here. Today. Now! But darling, that isn't too much of a trouble. Of course it's a pity we have no gas. But we can heat the fireplace with wood, and the good woman... The good woman! Oh no! Wait till you see her! Fire and bankruptcy are nothing compared with her! Her name's not Euphimia. It's Fury Harpy! - Where are you going? - Anywhere! To the world's end! Oh no! Tell her... I'm dead! Burned to death in the fire! George, that is uncivilized. Attention! I'm coming out! Let's see if everything is here. Looks like it is. What is this? 2 pounds 3 pence? With that money I could fly around the world. There. - What is this, a tip? - That is your fare! One for you, and one for you. I hope you know who I am? We do. You are miss Fury. Or miss Harpy? Welcome, miss Andrew! Hope the journey was a pleasant one? Very unpleasant, Mrs. Banks. By the way so are your children. Extremely unpleasant. This is Michael? And this one must be Jane? Why is she wearing trousers? In my days girls didn't wear those. - Yes, but I... - Be quiet! The children are extremely ill-bred. The boy will go to a military school and I will mind the girl. I hope you will like it here. What is this? Where did this heap of junk come from? And that - in front of an Englishman's house?! What happened to "My house is my fortress"? What is this - pop art? Disgusting! Take it away! - They'll take it away tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Morgen, morgen, nur nicht hoite... Tomorrow! - Understood? - I will see to it immediately. - Bitte. - Would you like to come in... - I would indeed. Where is the toilet? - The toilet? Yes. Is that your gardener? Hey, young lad! Take the luggage into the house! Be careful with the phials. I am very conscious of my health, Mrs. Banks. Wait a minute! The thing is too expensive to trust anyone with it. It was stuffy in the airplane, it's stuffy everywhere. One moment! I have to count my stuff. One, two, three, four, five. Spring will pass and autumn will pass, And autumn will pass! Oh-oh. Jane, a month is a very long time, is it? It is... It's 4 weeks and a short tail. Very wise. You did the right thing. It was very wise of you to come to me, mister Banks. In your situation the best thing is an emergency submersion. At first we will submerge to the depth of 100 feet. There you go! Here's to us, my boy. How do you like the depth? - Excellent depth. - I'd say, excellent! I almost feel the boat rocking. Trust the old salt, my boy. A thousand times I navigated my boats at this depth! They make their way noiselessly like moles! Dark all around you, the realm of octopuses and sharks! - Octopuses and sharks? - Yes! Then it's a pity it is not miss Andrew who goes down there. Oh, we would torpedo her down there! You think two bow torpedoes would be enough? - The displacement is too great. - Really? - Then we add one on the stern.. - You are a good sailor. - Torpedoes ready for launch! - Prepare for launching! Which kind of sport do you prefer? Biking. I go for hass grockey. I bet a ton against a square inch, that now... ... we are perfectly safe, my boy. And even if this miss Andrew were a nuclear rocket carrier... ... she would never get you! I hate to leave you, admiral. Why don't we sail on a voyage around the world? Autonomous voyage. Perfectly autonomous. Not to ever rise to the surface. It is so peaceful and quiet here. And no problems at all! They live in their polluted environment! And here there is no environment. I mean to say, no pollution! They suffer from fires, floods and tornadoes. And here we are completely fire-water-tornado-proof! They have energy crises. And we are absolutely autonomous. You see any crisis? Where is it? Where? Every time a see a tax-collector through my periscope, I drop flat on the seabed and switch on the TV-set! And I only watch the education channel. ... We are happy to welcome her in our city... ... and in the morning edition of our educational program. Miss Andrew devoted most of her life to... ... educating and upbringing children. - It's her. - And today... Am I hallucinating?. It's her! - Who? Where? - It's miss Andrew. She decided to establish an annual award of 15 000 Lb... ...to her best pupil. And what are the criteria, miss Andrew? The child must brush his teeth regularly and be obedient. That's all? But many of your pupils have already grown up. That is of no significance, my girl. An obedient pupil makes a good citizen. I would like you to answer some more questions. I am so tired, dearest! The journey was very tiresome. My secretary will answer your questions. Please, sir Thomas. - And I will watch the luggage. - But, miss Andrew! Could we hear miss Andrew's opinion of modern children? They're naughty boors! - And what about art? - Depravity! God damn my spleen! 15000 pounds to the best pupil! I'm saved! We surface! Well-well. Why didn't mister Robertson attend the ceremony? - He is not feeling well. - And what exactly is wrong with him? He... I can't hear you. - He's got the flue. - Get back in line. If he doesn't show up for breakfast, he won't get lunch. At ease! In the city center, Where grass doesn't grow, There lived a poet, a magician of the word, An inspired rhymester. He would rhyme everything he saw, Until he strained himself to breaking point, And so he went to the country, Where cows pick on green grass, To remedy his poor health. 33 cows, 33 cows, 33 cows. A fresh line! 33 cows, a new poem is born like a glass of fresh milk! 33 cows, a new poem is born like a glass of fresh milk. He would get up at 5 in the morning, That was not an easy task. He would recite his poems to the cows, And they would give him milk. Day after day, the summer went by. The poet grew a little taller. Everyone knows, milk diet... Is good for poets... If they're only 6! 33 cows, 33 cows, 33 cows, a fresh line! 33 cows, a new poem is born, like a glass of fresh milk. 33 cows, 33 cows, 33 cows, a fresh line! 33 cows, a new poem is born, like a glass of fresh milk. Like a glass of fresh milk, Like a glass of fresh milk! Sit down! I didn't give the signal to start. Dear friends, at the end of the third day of my presence here... ...I am forced to state that this is not a household, ...but a bunch of undisciplined idlers. On Friday George was 6 minutes late for lunch. What happened? - My bike broke down. - Don't interrupt! You have impossible manners, George. I'll take care of that. On Saturday Mrs. Banks... ...served me cold coffee. Would you care to explain? But we had no gas until today... George! It is not surprising that in such a family children grow up light-headed, lazy and ill-mannered! In South Cockatoo they send children like them... ...to penitentiaries for juvenile delinquents. - Isn't that true, dear Thomas? - Absolutely! Besides, I heard they had a governess, a suspicious type who knew nothing about children! - Please! - What?! But the most detestable object in your house is your brother. He doesn't work, he doesn't study! He demonstrated unheard-of disobedience by not showing up for the flag-raising ceremony. There are limits to everything. And the teeth? I saw it. I saw everything. You squeezed out toothpaste and threw it into the washbasin! What a disgrace! What kind of an example are you setting! I deprive you of your breakfast. Leave the table this instant! We are waiting. Very well. But don't expect me to trade my ideals for oatmeal porridge! With which, incidentally, you've been stuffing us for 3 days. You were right, Mary Poppins. A thousand times right. One needs to do something. Act, act! Now we can have breakfast. Well. Well. Enough, thank you. Breakfast is over. Danke zein, mein neihen! Thank you, darling. My friends, I think the wallpaper is shockingly motley. It's a disgrace for a respectable English home. I've ordered some new wallpaper. There' a sample. Come here, girl! Quick! Stand here. Little, boy you stand over there! How do you like it? I hope you remember how to put it up. - But Miss... - Of course we do, miss Andrew! When I was a little girl I was an expert in wallpapering. And I knew how to make paste - when I was younger. Well in that case you're not totally worthless. Coming! The taxi is here. I have to go to the bank. The sitting-room and my room must be finished until I return. Coming! Spring will pass and autumn will pass... "Andrew, go home!" - What does that mean, young man? It means what it says. I hope you can read. Yes, bastard, and you will pay for this! No lunch for you. Go lock yourself in the pantry. What?.. So that's how it is? A sitting strike! No supper for you either. Why don't you say something, everyone?! - I am waiting. - Please forgive him! - It's dark and there are rats. - That's right, rats! One more word, and you will meet them! I am waiting. Miss Andrew, allow me to talk to my brother. Permission granted. You have 30 seconds. Dear brother, she is a fury, but you know about the award. The week expires on Wednesday, and just now she said we were... ...not totally worthless. That means, there is still hope. A small chance to pay the fine. Negotiations over. - It's OK, miss Andrew. - All right, sister, I'll go. But don't think I gave up! Robert, please! Go away, Andrew! Go to hell's fire! What vulgar verses. What utter commonplace! Thank you so much. What is it? Get on with it! Start working! Children, out to the park! Some air before lunch wouldn't hurt! Coming! Coming! Go play in the park, children. I demand that this vile mongrel be rid of in 24 hours! Or else! Sir Thomas, you will be in charge, dearest. Of course! The bank, young man. Jane, how much longer until the end of the month? Four weeks, only now without the tail. - It's all so bad. - And worst of all for uncle Robertson. - Don't litter, children! - We don't, sir. - We don't litter, sir. - Well it better you would. When I was a boy, what could I litter with? 2-3 candy wrappers. And they litter and litter, and no one can say anything to them. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. And Neley is sad too. He must be feeling sorry for us. And I'm sorry he can't dance with me. He wanted to so much! If only Mary Poppins were here... ... she would let him play with us. Of course. But she isn't here. Jane, I think it's... It must be... - It's her! It's her! - It's her wind! I knew it! - Mary Poppins! - Mary Poppins! We knew you'd come back. We found your "Au revoir" note. I'd be much obliged if you would mind that this is a public place A city park, not a zoo. Watch your manners! And where, may I ask, are your gloves? We don't have any. What a shame. All right, let's go home and have some tea. Tea! Listen! I will have to file in a report. You can't just drop in from the sky. It is against the law! Where did you come from, may I ask? If I heard you correctly, you said I fell from the sky. - But you... - Like a crow. You were talking about me, mister Smith? - Yes. - Better not say anything. I mean, I... - Were you or weren't you? - No, no. No. No, mam. Thank you. If I were in your place, that is if I were a park watchman... I would wear a cap and button up my jacket. With your permission. - All the best, sir. - Put on your cap, sir. So you say, she claims I don't know how to treat children? - But we didn't say that. - We didn't say that! Of course you didn't. You're not the kind who sneaks on others. And that I'm a suspicious type. That right? I hate scenes, but this time I think we can't avoid one. - And where is this miss Andrew? - She left. To the bank, I presume? Where else can such a famous person go? Naturally, the bank! And mister Thomas was left in charge. Thomas? Since when do they call him Mister? I give interviews! Since when do they address you as Mister, Thomas? What did you say? Six months in this cage! But that's terrible! What else did he say? It's a sad story. He lived far away in a country called South Cockatoo. - We know about Cockatoo! - Dad says our money was lost there. - His money, that is. - What utter disgrace! When Thomas lived there no one got lost in Cockatoo. It was a joyous country. And it was called Cockatoo... ...because the jungle abounded in parrots. By the way Thomas was the elder of the kin. We met on the occasion of your centenary. - Am I right, Thomas? - Absolutely! But then the power in Cockatoo was seized by some avid people ... who started selling off parrots. And what wealthy idler wouldn't want to have a live talking toy? That is how poor Thomas got to be with miss Andrew. And his only consolation is that he is tremendously expensive! How can you even ask?! Shame on you! Aren't we old buddies? And didn't you hear her call me a suspicious type? - Me! A perfectly perfect person! - Absolutely! - Go ahead, Thomas! Don't be afraid! - All right! Fly up North to the airport. The plane to Cockatoo leaves at 6.30 It's a white speckled plane with a gray parrot on the side. Wait until they finish loading the luggage and jump in. It'll be a bit cold but you'll warm yourself at home. - It is miss Andrew. - Go! - Fly away, mister Thomas! - Hurry! - Good bye! - Good bye, Mary! Spring will pass and autumn will pass... How come there are strangers on the premises? Who opened the cage? Where is my parrot? Good-bye, kind children! See you soon, Mary! Tzuruk! Come back here! Come back? Sir Thomas! Mary... What a pleasant surprise! So it is you? Very well. You've come back! The suspicious type. I'm glad. I wanted to square accounts with you for everything you... Help! Let me out of here! Let me out! You said I didn't know anything about bringing up children. I am sorry! Forgive me! You said I was cruel and immoral. It was a misunderstanding! A mistake. I'm sorry. You called me a suspicious type. I take my words back! All of them and each one separately! You locked uncle Robertson away with rats. Your uncle? I'll let him out this very minute! - I don't think so. - Hey there! Hello, Mary! I heard your voice. You arrived just in time. Remember what I told you, Andrew? Justice will reign! How did you do it, Mary? I don't know about you, but I am bored with this miss Andrew. I would take a hot bath, drink some tea... ... and take a nap after the tiresome journey. Mister Hey! I heard you wrote something on a poster? - That's right. Say it again, and let's get it over and done with. I wrote: "Andrew, go home!" Young man, I'm paying 5 pounds extra! To the airport! Hurry! Once there lived a barber, He was the kindest barber ever born, He shaved animals and made them haircuts. After he'd done his job, cats would look like mice, And even foolish monkeys would look more like people. It happened last summer... In the middle of January... In a far-away kingdom... Where there never was a king. Once he met a lion, And at first he got a little scare, But then he gathered all his courage... ... and said very politely: If you want to look good, ... you have to trim your mane and whiskers twice a year. It happened last summer... In the middle of January... In a far-away kingdom... Where there never was a king. What happened next? Everyone who saw a lion, knows that! To cut a lion's hair is like playing with fire. Now the lion had the haircut of a poodle, And he swallowed the poor barber together with his instruments! It happened last summer... In the middle of January... In a far-away kingdom... Where there never was a king. It happened last summer... Somewhere in the middle of January! Miss Poppins! You came back because you found out mister Banks was in trouble! But don't lose heart! Astute Bill never lost heart and always found a way out! Mary Poppins! Mary Poppins! Where were you for so long? You wouldn't believe the fire we had here! But the most frightful thing was this woman! She called Bartholomew a loathsome mongrel! On my part, miss Poppins, I insist that you... ... remind mister Banks about hooks and fire-extinguishers. Or I will have to fine him again! And in his situation... Her Majesty's Royal Fleet... is happy to see you again, lady Mary! You see, Mary... I... I regret to say that we will probably have to... ... do without your services for the time being. You see... We do love you very much, Mary. But as things stand now... ...we can't afford to pay even the most meagre allowance. But I hope you can still offer me some tea. 2 pounds of sausages, 5 matchboxes, 3 dozens of eggs, a package of salt and ginger flavoring. - On credit? - Naturally. As usual. Rain in the evening, fog in the morning. My bones ache. Speaking of bones, how is Mr. Banks feeling? In his present state... You're not saying I am slightly on the pale side, are you? Oh no! Of course not! I meant nothing of the kind. I just wanted to say that my rheumatism was killing me. They say there is a wonderful medicine for rheumatism. - What is it? - Singing. An hour of vocal before lunch, an hour after. Oh no, please, miss! - So you were asking for a pack of smoked flavoring. - Ginger! Very well. And what else did you say? You will take all that to mister Banks tonight. Thank you so much, miss. You look wonderful. I never doubted that. But I can hardly say the same about you. - Where are we going? - Across the railway, ...we follow bus No. 39, then cross the bridge and go ahead. - But where? - Did you hear of this cat that died of curiosity? But the railroad, the bus and the bridge are over there! I changed my mind. And stop telling me where to go. Besides we are already there. "All you need for ballet lessons". What do we need ballet dances for? Ballet dances are for... ... dancing at balls! Bonjour, sir. I had an appointment! Oh-la-la! Well if it isn't Mary Poppins! Jane and Michael are here too! What a surprise! I suppose, darling, the children have come to take a few lessons? And you are quite right, Corry. In that case, little chickens, remember Rule number One. Ballet dances, just like all dances for that matter,.. ... are danced in pairs. Otherwise they wouldn't make sense! Dancing in solitude shows poorly on one's world outlook. Now for Rule number Two: invitation to a dance. The partner approaches the lady slowly, with much dignity... ... and looks her straight in the eyes! The lady's eyes ought to be half-closed, ... head slightly inclined, ... feet in third position. An invitation to the dance doesn't like fussing around. The lady drops a deep curtsey. Oh, I'm sorry. It had to be a deep one in the old days, ... and now a slight bow would be sufficient. Isn't that so, Mary Poppins? And now, my kittens, pay attention! Wonderful! Just like at a dance festival! It's nothing wonderful, compared to something else. But I'm not giving it out just yet. Too bad that we have to go, madam Corry. I do hope to see you again soon, my little chickens. Only you must give me your very honest word, ... that you will keep what I will give you now. - 3, 4... - We promise! Louis, see the guests to the door, please. Jane Banks! Michael Banks! - Au revoir, Sir. - Au revoir. - Au revoir. - Au revoir. Tomorrow I will be ruined. Ruined! Do you even understand what it means? Don't shout! I understand. You will be ruined. No, you don't understand a thing! That means all the neighbors will know I'm ruined! All papers will write I'm ruined! Well at last they will write about you in the papers. And you mock at me! You heartless creature! Oh, the times of stress and anguish! Oh, my poor nerves! Oh, my poor heart! What are you doing, George? Run away! Run away from heart attack! I've come to say good-bye, Mary Poppins. I am leaving, and nobody knows about it except you. I wanted to talk to you before I leave. Take a seat. I won't take much of your time. I was going to say two things. First of all, it was me who drilled a hole in the gas pipe. Are you giving yourself in to the police? I am not that stupid! My confession wouldn't help things. I am going to roam the country on foot. I want everyone to know what happened to Mr. Banks. And then our children will be saved. This is what I intend to do, Mary Poppins. And the second thing you want to tell me? I wanted to tell you that long ago, but I won't say it now... ... because right now I have no right to do so. But when the time comes and I'll have accomplished my mission... I will come back to you, Mary, and say it. All right then, I'll wait. But the question is: what shall I say to Michael and Jane? - Say whatever you like. - Just like that? I'll tell them, mister Hey left them at a moment of hardships, and that there will be no one to play with them and sing to them, and protect them from Andrew. - But I have to fight injustice! But why look for it so far away? I am not trying to discourage you. But who should I rely on in case I would have to leave? - Where? - Where they need me more. I don't dare to insist, you are your own man, but... Don't you think they need you here? Always. Every minute. With your just heart, your kind hands and your songs. You really think so, Mary Poppins? I always say what I think! What am I to do then? It is not my rule to advise people, but I think... that the best thing for you to do is to go to sleep now. Wait, Mary Poppins! Wait! I have so much to say about you, about me, and the children. But the children want their milk. They can't go to sleep hungry just because we have to talk. Yes. - We will have plenty of time to talk, mister Hey. I promise! 6 pence and 4 - ding. Makes 10. And another half-penny - ding. And threepence - ding. And I have four pennies - ding. And another two. Only that still won't be enough. Hurry up! Your beds are waiting for you. It is impolite to make them wait that long. Can one be late to go to bed? - And do the beds even care? - Of course! A few more questions - ... and be sure, you are late. - Where? That was the first question. Hey, get up! You have little time, don't waist it. Get dressed and go to the children's room. Over and out. Wake them up and bring them to the guest room. Don't forget the balloons. See you there. Hey! Wake up! Your balloons. Jane Banks! Michael Banks! Look, Jane! - All our neighbors are here! - And there's mom and dad! Michael, Jane, come quick! You must congratulate to Mary. - Why? - Didn't you know? Today's her birthday! Sir Louis, go tell Mary. Well, little chickens, don't loiter! Mary Poppins asked about you twice already! - Happy birthday, Mary Poppins! - Happy birthday! Thank you, my friends. Thanks for coming! Why on earth did you show up without a tail-coat? Happy birthday, Mary Poppins! And you, mister Hey, are wearing sneakers? That is unheard of! Sir Louis, take care of that. Now that everything is taken care of, we can celebrate! Miss Jane, I waited so long for this ball! - Then let's dance. - You think I can do it? Don't worry. Remember, first the invitation. The partner approaches the lady, carrying himself with dignity. - Her eyes are half-open... - Stop making fun of it! She inclines her head and drops a deep curtsey. Thank you all for coming. I never had such a wonderful birthday party. It is the best present you could give me. And now it is my turn to give you a present. It's there for you! A merry-go-round and a pleasant encounter! Please. I haven't taken a ride on a merry-go-round since I was a boy He's got my balloon! Do you recognize me? Come here quick! We'll go for a ride. Coming. Come here! Let's go for a ride! My God, look at her! The same short panties. The same ink stain on them! I got it hot from Miss Andrew. You remember? Of course I do. Well, kitties, they meet at last. A wonderful idea! - A great attraction, isn't it, my chickens? - What about us? - You? - Yes. What about us? - Your future is yet to come. - And me? I have a feeling, mister Hey... ...you haven't forgotten your childhood still. By the way, there's someone waiting for you. I envy you! You can read as much as you like. Sometimes I think would trade all these books... ... for a chance to talk to someone. Are you lonely? I feel more and more lonely with the years. What about Cathy Lark? Did you like her? You shared the same desk at our school on Cherry St. Mrs. Lark! We are different people, you know. She's not interested in Astute Bill, and I don't like dogs. He hates dogs, and I hate this horrible Bill. And when I need to talk to someone, I have Edward and Bartholomew. - Is Bartholomew your friend? - Of course he is. And I will make a point of tracing his genealogical tree. - But is it that important? - What is, darling? Do you need to know one's genealogy to be friends? But of course not, but... All devices went out of order, god damn my spleen! I saw rats at the caboose the other day. Otherwise it's OK. - Doesn't it get boring? - Well, it's safe though. You used to love the sun, the wind, the salty splashes! Did you have to lock yourself in this stinking tank? What if it starts? A house and two charming kids! It all came out just the way we wanted. Are you happy? Very much! I swear, I don't need anything else! - But I will be pennyless! - We will still have the house. And you will still have your hands! You can live with that! I need money to make money. It is my tool. I am a financial worker. What shall I invest, if I don't have any money? Maybe it's better that you don't? Were you ever lucky? Maybe you only think you're a financial worker? What am I then? Poor-poor mister Hey. How could you think I will leave you without a present? This is for you to play your best and kindest songs. Don't be sad. Cheer up! What will your nephews think? Are you leaving us? Everything good has to end sometime. Especially dreams. The Earth spins like a merry-go-round, And above it whirl the winds of losses, The winds of losses, separation, grievances and anger, They are without number. They are without number, they blow from all cracks, They blow through people's hearts, tear doors off hinges, They destroy hopes and instill fear. The winds whirl, the winds whirl. Day and night, for a hundred years... The Earth spins like a merry-go-round. For a hundred years the winds... Come back to where they started. But there is a wind of changes. It'll come and drive away the treacherous winds, When the time comes lt'll disperse... The winds of separation and the winds of anguish! Day and night for a hundred years... The Earth spins like a merry-go-round. For a hundred years everything returns... To where it started. Tomorrow the wind will change, Tomorrow it will do away with the past. It will come, a kind and gentle breeze. The wind of changes. Tomorrow the wind will change, Tomorrow it will do away with the past. It will come, a kind and gentle breeze. The wind of changes. Good-bye, Mary Poppins! Good-bye, Mary Poppins! Tomorrow the wind will change, Tomorrow it will do away with the past. It will come, a kind and gentle breeze, The wind of changes. The wind of changes. THE END USSR GOSTELERADIO, 1983
