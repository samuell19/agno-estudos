Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville. Welcome to Jackass. Hello. I'm Johnny Knoxville and I'm about to rent a car. - What's up? - Hi, I have a reservation. Okay, I need a driver's license and a credit card. All right. I need a signature here that you're going to use your coverage instead of ours. - Is that white one us? - Yes. And we're gonna walk around it, inspect it together. Looks pretty good. I'm just looking for dents and major scratches. Yeah. Something major, gonna write it down. Little ding there. Yeah. No, we'll take good care of her. Thank you. Have a good week. You, too. Thank you. I'm Johnny. Hey, man. We're gonna be doing a hell of a lot of work here today. Trust us. We're gonna have fun. Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville, and this is called the Rent-a-Car Crash-Up Derby. Oh, fuck! You guys are gonna die! Shut the car off before it gets hot. Oh, fuck! I guess we didn't reinforce the windshield. That fucker kept... Missed me by that much. That's why you got the roll bars behind you, dude. Whose car is this? - Uh, this is your guys' car. - I rented it from you earlier. Yes. Yeah, what... Yeah, I hit a dog. A dog didn't cause this. Come on in. I had a accident, as you can see. I was... I mean, I drink. I just black out, so I... Were you drinking or anything? Yeah, I had a little, to be honest. Is there any license plates on it? There was. Yeah? Well, hopefully you guys will incur some of the cost. Oh, no. 'Cause I rented it from you guys fair and square. Yeah. I don't want to get stuck with the whole charge of it. Well, you are gonna get stuck with the entire thing. - Well, I don't think I should. - I think you guys should help. No. You declined any additional coverage. Right there. You declined it. Yeah, but that's just paperwork, you know? That's a legal contract. Yeah, but I was a little... I was... I had a few to drink when I signed that, too, so... Well, we're gonna have to get this worked out. Yeah, you're gonna have to pay for that car. Well, you're gonna have to help me pay for that car. No, we don't do that. I returned it with a full tank of gas. You returned it demolished. Well, it's got a full tank of gas. That's the least of our worries right now, is the gas. Oh. This is an unmitigated outrage. I've never seen anything like this before. What does that mean? No one's ever done that. Well, I can't pay for it. Well, you're gonna have to. Well, I ain't. Look, I'm gonna let you two guys work it out and I'm gonna go outside, but, um, that car's gonna have to be paid for. "F" you! Are you all right? You all right? Knoxville knocked my nuts in half.

I-It's considered less lethal. So, this morning I thought I was taking it in the chest with the beanbag projectile, but George and his company said, "No way."

Well, I made the mistake of showing them what sea cucumbers do when they're threatened. And that is, you know, as soon as something touches them, these white threads come out of the end of it, and Steve-O and Chris thought it was a great idea. So, they're out there trying to, uh... Masturbate? Masturbate. Yeah. So, anyway, I... I apologize. This is the Whale Shark Gummer. With a simple shave of the razor, Steve-O easily disguises himself to fool the whale sharks into thinking he's a harmless young boy. I am pretty nervous about my wiener around that whale shark. I really am. Now, the best way to think of the whale sharks is they're like big puppy dogs. Uh, sometimes puppies bite. Yeah, but they have little teeth. Puppies, they have little teeth. Little teeth. You're gonna get a gummer. All right. So, it's kind of like being with a gal with no teeth. Kind of, yes. Yeah. So right below in these waters, 30-foot whale sharks are waiting to eat these freaking shrimp out of our crotches. Okay. Oh, they're kind of... They pinch. Are these alive? They don't feel good on the way... You're part of this, man. Look at this shrimp. I guess I don't really have any last words.

I'm doing it! Don't look at it. Dude, it's dripping out of the bottom. Will you catch that, what's dripping out the bottom? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That sucked. Kick yourself in the head, Wee Man. This guy. He'll do anything just to look better. No, get away. Now what is? Are you starting to lose your mind on that shit? Bam, stop it! Now, you're getting crazy on this shit. Ape! He's starting to lose it! Jesus Christ! Ape, I need toilet paper! Okay, this is called the Golf Course Airhorn. When people tee off, when they're coming down with their, uh, swing, we're gonna blow these airhorns. - Here she goes again. - No. Is it another one? She still hit it really good. Holy shit. What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Here, you've lost your club. Sorry. Didn't I tell you I was gonna come over here and kick your ass for that? What? I'm sorry. I got bursitis. You got bursitis? Yeah. So, that means you gotta play with a horn? It helps. I'll give you something to play with, pal. Sorry. It won't happen again. - Oh, fuck! - Shit. He's teeing off! Get down! Get down! Oh, shit! Get back. Get down, get down. Watch this! Wait. Wait. Get down, Dimitry. Oh, these things are scary. I'm Bam Margera. I'm Johnny Knoxville. And we're gonna be burglars today. Oh, God! Fuck! Get the diamonds! Dude, I told you not to fall off the damn beam. Turn around! Turn around! Fuck! Oh, holy fuck! Idiot! What the fuck is that? Go! Holy fuck! You all right? You okay? I'm good. I'm good. What'd you think happened right there? It's embarrassing. I was barely halfway through the ceiling, and you were already out the door. You were really sprinting. Really, guys in masks, I'm out. I don't play. I don't play. Is there any actual, like, real reason why anyone would shove something up their ass like this? No. I'm claiming predictions for this event. Where's Ryan? Did you make them? Number one, it's not getting in there. Number two, even if it does, it's not staying in there. Definitely no sitting down happening. Number three, there's no way they're gonna believe that this is true. So, you're saying it's... I'm saying there's nothing I want more than for this to happen, but... You don't want it to happen that much. No, I really do. This is our original talent for this piece, by the way. Yeah. I think that... It's one of the first things I think I've ever seen you duck out on. Oh, man, I am so glad I turned this idea down. I'm so glad. I'll probably use all of this before the end of the segment. Uh, what else we got? A condom. Thank you. And, um, a little toy car. Blue, it's my favorite color. Let me see that. Dangle it. Look at the reservoir tip. Now I'm lubing up... I can't see the car, Ryan. The little toy car, because I'm going to put it in my butt. Be comfortable. Hey, Ed's here for rescuing, dude. You're here for making it a problem. All right, you're gonna watch this? You're making me uncomfortable. Sorry. I gotta get another job. Lube up your corn hole. I am. I'm spackling. "Spackling." Heart rate's going up for sure! Oh, dude, it hurts. Your adrenaline's flowing, isn't it? There's no getting around it, it fucking hurts like hell. Come on in, Manny. You're just in time, Manny. Oh, Manny. Tell me I'm a man. Hey, man, he's got it... It feels so goddamn gross. This is totally insane. It's in, dude. It's in? Yeah. Let's see. Oh, fuck! I feel like I have to shit my ass. Is there anything in tap? You said that you didn't want to do it because your dad would disown you? Well, I mean, it wasn't that. You drank wine off of a dude's ass crack. My dad never saw that. I never told him that, you know. I was gonna do this and I was like, "Dad" I was like, "Dad, we're going hard these days, "and there's some ideas floating around." I just mentioned the... the car in the butt. My dad, like... The only time in my life I ever heard my dad, like... You know, it's like when your parents say, "I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed," you know. Like, that hurts so much more, you know? Fucking rad. Look at him walk. Dunn's gonna win, dude. I'm not too excited about this skit. It's not my favorite I've ever done, because there's a toy car in my butt. But this is the Butt X-ray. I think I need an x-ray. Antoine? Yes? How you doing? Pretty good. I'm Ryan, and this is... What can I do for you? I was partying last night with some frat guys. I passed out. I must've fallen down and broken something, 'cause I haven't been able to walk right since. We're gonna take x-ray now, to be sure. Okay. Take a... Oh, okay. This is comfy. Hold your breath. Don't move. What is that? I have no idea. That's not part of you. That's something extra. I would've known if I ate that. No. You... you wouldn't be able to swallow that. That is a car toy. Well, how did a car toy get there? Maybe you stuck it up your ass. I didn't stick anything up my ass. Have you ever seen anything like that? No, I never seen that in there. I've seen a toy car all over, but, no, never in somebody's rectum. You can't get it out? You don't have... No. I'm a physician, but I practice this, x-ray, only. You think maybe I can just, you know, poop it out? You won't be able to poop it out. In fact, it will hurt you. In fact, I don't think it's even good for you that you poop it out. What will happen if you take Ex-Lax? Will that help? No, if he takes Ex-Lax, well, he gets a lot of diarrhea, but no car. I appreciate it. Thank you for taking care of me. Okay. Thanks again. He's alive! Oh, Johnny Knoxville. He made it. Oh, there is a God. Oh, please. And at last! I thought it would never... This is the end! Oh, thank you, Jesus! Oh, child! Let's see it! Let's see it!
