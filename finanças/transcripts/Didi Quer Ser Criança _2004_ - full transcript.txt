Didi! Didi! Let's go, Didi. It's Cosmas & Damian's Day. Come on, Didi! -Look. -Please, stop. Jeez. -Here comes another one. -Stop. -Hey, stop. -Please, lady! -No one's stopping. -Calm down. -Now we're talking. -I want some too. Happy Cosmas & Damian's Day. -Happy Cosmas & Damian's Day. -Get out of here. You want candy? Go get a job. Happy Cosmas & Damian's Day. Have you no shame? Disturbing the kids. Go get a job, bum. They only give candy to children. It's discrimination. Didi, not even kids are getting candy. Nobody cares about Cosmas and Damian. CANDY FACTORY COSMAS & DAMIAN TEN MONTHS LATER... We can't wait any longer. Let's go. -I don't want to. -It's time for school. DO NOT TOUCH Come on. We'll be late. TOUCH Wow! CANDY FACTORY GOLDEN LOLLIPOP Wonderful. Great. That's what I needed. The factory's new ad. Take a look, sweetie. It looks beautiful, Dad. Jeez, Dad. You called me here to see this rubbish. Sandrinha, let's roll. So, Professor Muller, have you figured out how to increase production? Yes, I have, Mr. Armando. A small amount of the formula should replace the artificial sweetener, alongside the color additive 136, giving the candies a spongy texture with gaseous particles, and tripling their physical volume. In other words, one piece of candy turns into three. You're a genius, professor. However, there's a minor side effect. When in contact with saliva, these candies release a pigment which makes children glow in the dark. That's wonderful. I can already envision our ad campaign. Dozens of children glowing in the dark. An energy-saving treat. Parents will love it. What are we waiting for? The material used to make the candies is radioactive, and it has been banned. If it's been banned, professor, we have to omit the name of the substance from the ingredients list on the packaging. But how are we going to buy the material? It's very easy, Professor Muller. The material is radioactive. We have to smuggle it from countries that develop atomic bombs. I'll bring it in mixed with the goods. And that's all there is to it. We still don't know if this material will harm the children. Do I really care? Children love to eat junk food. Look at the damage you caused at the mall. How are we going to pay all these people? It wasn't my fault. I took a scooter thinking it was an ordinary scooter, but it had an engine, and I didn't know how to stop. Didi, you know our financial situation is not good. Calm down, Tião. Not everything is lost. Cosmas & Damian's Day is coming. People will buy candy for the kids. -We'll make money. The factory will grow. -Didi... You are truly naive, Didi. Times have changed, Didi. Kids nowadays don't like our candy anymore. All they want are those... fancy candies. Like these ones. Check it out. See? Published ads in magazines. Brand advertising in newspapers and on TV. Look. Our tongue turns red, green... For God's sake, Didi. You will never grow up. Didi, I love you like a son. I just hope our factory survives. Unfortunately, it will take a miracle. Holy Cosmas and Damian, can you hear me? Here's the thing... I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me and my friends. I know I owe this empire to you. Yeah, this is an empire. One doesn't need much to be happy. I wanted to make one more request. No, it's not for my sake. It's for Tião, the factory owner. He's in great need. I know you're busy helping everyone, but Tião really needs it. It's important to us. Tião needs to make his candies to help save Cosmas & Damian's Day. The spirit of Cosmas & Damian's Day must flourish, and people are in need of it right now on Earth. At this time, I'll give you a voucher. All the Lord's Prayers and Hail Marys that I'm due for, I won't be able to say tonight. Please, put it on my tab. I'll get to them later. But whatever you need here on Earth, you can count on me. Amen. Just one last request. Send my regards to JC, son of the Almighty. Tell him it's from Didi. Apologies. I'll be blowing out the candle to cut down expenses. Didi! Didn't hurt. GOLDEN LOLLIPOP I knew it. I knew it was you, Didi. Security! Security! Take it easy, guys. You again, Didi? We can't clean your mess all the time. Who will pay for all the damage? Me. I will pay as always. -Which is never. -I'm faithful to my ways. Am I right? -Stop. -Didi. Enough of your shenanigans. Leave before anyone sees you. Right. Get out of here. -Behave yourselves. -Thanks. Dude, it's good to be a kid. Just because I kicked a ball, broke the popcorn cart and hit the store sign, the guards wanted to arrest me. They never touch you. You're always wanting to be a kid. Look at that gorgeous guitar, dude. -Be respectful. She's my beauty. -I mean the one in the store. -Didi. -How are you? -Not great. -Sorry I'm late. You've disappeared. Sometimes I think you don't like me. Don't look at other women when you're with me. Baby, doesn't matter who I look at. There may be many women in my mind, but there's only you in my heart. Didi, I don't know anymore. When you're with me, I can feel your distance. Wherever you are, you will always be there. -I'm talking about your vague stare. -Those who get lost -never know where they are. -Don't make excuses. There are plenty of men out there. Better looking than you. Let me give you some advice: An ugly man in the hand is worth two handsome ones kissing in the bush. My God, Didi. Changing the subject. When are we going to that nice restaurant like you promised? We'll go as soon as I finish paying -my TV installments. -You don't own a TV. Really? How lucky am I? One less debt. I wasn't even aware. Didi, that won't do. It's one screwup after another. -But... -We'll talk later. -Babe, come back... -This is ridiculous. It's cool to be an adult and have such a gorgeous girlfriend. A word of advice, dude. Enjoy life while you are a child. You can play without any responsibility. Your childhood never comes back. Childhood is overrated, Didi. I want to grow up fast and be able to watch adult movies. Hey, what are you saying? Dude, are you going to spend all day staring at this guitar? -Poor Didi. I'll leave soon. -No problem. I'm leaving too. Talk to you later. As Americans say: -I see you later. -I see you later. Bye. -What are you doing? -Checking this kite out. Cool. Ask for it as a birthday present. My birthday was yesterday. My mom can't afford birthday presents. This will change. One day, she'll be able to buy it for you. Believe in your dreams. That only happens in dreams. Hey, buddy. -This is for you. -For me? -Happy birthday. -Thank you! I gotta run. It takes me over half an hour to walk home. No walking. I'll take you home. My birthday gift. Come on. Let's go. Man, what is this huge antenna for? It's not an antenna. It's a lightning rod. Lightning rod? What for? To avoid carjacking on a rainy day. Get in the back. I'll be your driver. Put your seat belt on. Guys, let's crash this car. Let's end this piece of junk. My God, what have they done to my car? It can't be. My dear Lord. This is so cruel. Juvenal, what have they done to you? This was my only possession. Cosmas and Damian got distracted and look what happened. Things are bad at the factory. Now I can't get around. I have no place to go. It took me two years to buy it. Paid higher interest than installments. Look what happened. Tomorrow will be a better day. AMBULANCE Didi? Hey, man. You're just in time. -Hey, man. -Do you need a ride? -Sure. Where are you going? -To the mall. -Can I lie down in the back? -Yeah. -Jump in. -I need a nap. You saved my life. Anesthesia. Must be great for memory loss. Raffle tickets are only 1 real. Don't miss your chance to win this car. You'll be helping out the children. It's only 1 real. -Didi, there you are. -Hi. -Can you spare 1 real? -I have no money. -Not even one single real? -Nope. I'm as hard up as this car. Come on, Didi. I know about your hidden money. Everyone knows about my savings. All right, I'm in. EMERGENCY SAVINGS There you go. Here it is. Good luck. Likewise. Sorry to bother you. Could we sleep under the awning? We have nowhere else to go, and it's really cold. First of all, stay away from me. Second, stay away from my car. You guys are disgusting and dirty. My factory is not a hotel for bums. Excuse me. I'll make a sandwich. With what? There's no ham, no cheese. No taste. Some meat. Adding an egg. Egg... fries... tomatoes... meat... and vegetables. Delicious. Water to push it down. Who might that be? It can't be good news. Twelve caliber. What do you want? May we come in? It's cold outside. Sure, come in. Please, come in. What happened to you? We're hungry. Do you have anything to eat? Yes, of course. Let's eat. Could we spend the night outside your factory? No. No way. You'll sleep right here. Imagine staying outside in this cold weather. You're all wet. It's too dangerous. Take my room. I made some coffee to warm you up. Could you pass the sugar? But it says "salt." -In order to deceive the ants. -Right. You have to stir like this. There's no spoon. I think a bath would do wonders. You guys are dirty like possums. I have some clean clothes over here. The bathroom is right over there. Feel free to take a shower. Before bedtime, we pray. Do you know how? Not exactly. No problem. I can teach you. First, kneel down. Put your hands together. Look up. Steady mind to call the Almighty. Then you pray to Cosmas and Damian. Holy Saints Cosmas and Damian. Please, forgive these two who don't know how to pray. They will learn and become devotees like me. Thank you for this day. Apart from my car, of course, because you got distracted and those kids showed up and tore it down. I'm sure I'll figure out how to get a brand-new car. If I make it, I promise you I'll cut out a picture of you and hang it on the rearview mirror. See? You ask for stuff, then promise something back to balance it out. Holy Saints Cosmas and Damian. Please protect these two who are in greater need than me. And also protect Tião and his factory. Because if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have a place to stay. Thank you so much for that. Now... the Lord's Prayers and Hail Marys, I won't be able to say tonight because they don't know their prayers. Please put it on my tab. I'll get to them later. -Amen. -Amen. You catch on quickly. Amen as well. Reducing expenses. Let's go to bed. Are you twins? Who was born first? The most experienced sleeps on the floor. And you sleep there. Good night. TEST PILOT Hey, Tião. I've never seen you like this. What's wrong? Sales are down. If this keeps up, I see no other solution... but to close down the factory. But you can't do this. Son... we don't always do what we want. COSMAS & DAMIAN They're Cosmas & Damian candies. I've always wanted one of these. Whose candies are these? Take them. They're yours. Mine? Guys, you guessed it right. Always wanted a bag like this on Cosmas & Damian's Day. Every year, I go trick-or-treating, but adults only give it to kids, not me. It's the greatest gift ever. Another great gift that I wish for is to be able to save Tião's factory. What can I do? Remember: Kids listen to one another. Kids listen to one another. I won't forget. There's something inside. It's a holy card. "Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it." What does it mean? Hey... where did they go? Come here, man. Let me show you what I have. Awesome. Didi, this is so cool. Finally. You never got one on Cosmas & Damian's Day. They are different from the factory candies. When a friend gets a nice gift, what does he do? -He shares it equally. -That's right. One candy for you. I keep the bag. No. You have to share equally, Didi. -You're greedy, huh? -No. I just want more. Who were Cosmas and Damian again? Were they children? No, Didi. They were twins who were born in Arabia in the 3rd century. They were doctors. And they became saints -because they protected the children. -Correct. -Felipe, is that you? -Is that you, Didi? Felipe, our dreams came true. I'm an adult, Didi. I'll be able to date -all the women I want. -I'll be able to play all day. -Now what? -Let's have some fun. See? The ball always looks for the stars. What's up, guys? The king has arrived. What? Don't you recognize me? No. I've never met you. -Are you taking us for suckers? -We're all brothers here. -Strangers are not welcome. -I just wanted to play with you. Get out. Stick to your crowd. Hi, Adriana. Do I know you? No, not really. Aren't you Didi's girlfriend? -Yes, I am. But don't even mention him. -Why? What happened? That big baby stood me up again. We were supposed to meet and he hasn't shown up. He must be playing marbles with his buddy, Felipinho. Felipinho, huh? Look, Didi is a nice guy. True, but all his friends are children. He's also very irresponsible. I want someone who loves me and pays attention to me. Don't mind so much. Didi doesn't know any better. I kind of understand him. He also has a big heart. He's helped me many times. Yeah, but... if you know him so well, how come I've never heard of you? -We haven't seen each other in a while. -What's your name? -Fe... Felipe. -Funny. That's his best friend's name. Can you believe that silly boy looks at my legs as if I never notice? -What's wrong, Adriana? -I don't know what to do. I feel very lonely. Don't be so sad. Hold on just a sec. May I help you? Could you lend me a guitar for a couple of minutes? For a couple of minutes? To play for my girlfriend. Your girlfriend? All right. But just for a couple of minutes, huh? Thank you. I can come up With ways to steal A kiss from you I can even joke around While my eyes meet yours In desire I haven't got a chance When you show up Everything works out Everything's all right Bring me the sun The island and the lighthouse And the beach to reach Your eyes Made me see All I want is you And nothing else And nothing else Wow. What a lovely song. -You have an amazing voice. -Thanks. Thank you for lending me the guitar. You're welcome. Come by the store whenever you need. I'd love to hear you sing again. Who's that chick? She's the girl who lent me the guitar. She was very nice. A beautiful song. Never heard it before. I wrote it. You were the first to hear it. You're very talented. -What's your name? -Didi. My boyfriend, Felipinho, has a friend named Didi. But he's an adult. I mean... He's an adult, but only in size. He's a big baby. Have you seen Felipinho? I don't know this Felipinho. Not your loss. He's annoying. He's only into his music, and he doesn't care about me. Besides, he likes older girls. He says I'm too young for him. He's a lucky guy. -What did you say? -Oh, nothing. You're a funny boy. Tag, you're it. What's wrong, Didi? It's nothing. I forgot how fun it was to play. My beauties. Finally, you're here. Muller... no more excuses. The equipment is here. Just start production. Mr. Armando, I'm afraid to say... Muller. No more excuses. Go to your lab. Don't come back without a sample. Go. Who are you? I think he's a thief. -Let's call the police. -Please, don't. I'm Didi. Didi is an adult. You're a kid. I don't know how to explain it. Oh, I got it. Didi, there's no need to explain yourself. Such a character. It's Tião. He can't see me like this. Come with me. Hide in your drawer. I'll hide under the covers. He's always leaving the door open. Didi! Hey, Didi! -Didi. -Yes? Where were you? I was right here. I'm sick. Sick? I've noticed that your voice is thinner and weaker. -I just need to rest. -Let me see if you have a fever. Don't take off my blanket. I'll catch a draft and get worse. Okay, get plenty of rest. I really need you here at the factory. Tião needs me just when I became a child. Didi, you can be more helpful as a kid. Kids listen to one another, remember? Right. I totally forgot. So, Didi, use your child state to do good. Help Tião succeed and bring back Cosmas and Damian's holiday spirit. You got it. I promise to try. Let's go to sleep. Busy day tomorrow. Holy saints. I have important things to do tomorrow and it's already late. Please put my prayers on my tab. I'll get to them later. Amen. Nighty-night. Farty farts. Handball offense. Go. -What's your name, kid? -Didi. You're okay. -Wanna play with us? -Yes. Let's go. Dude, what's this thing you're eating? You never seen this? It's a coconut candy. What a lame candy. Something my dad would eat. This is cool. It's not natural. Full of coloring. -It gives you cramps. -You sound like my mother. It's true. You never had a stomachache -after eating those candies? -Sometimes. And doesn't your tongue go all numb? Yeah, but only for a bit. See? -Dude, this is delicious. -Spread it around. -I want one. -Me too. GOLDEN LOLLIPOP Professor Muller, you're a genius. This new formula will greatly increase our production. By my count, we're going to quadruple -our product sales. -In that case, Mr. Armando, we'll need to expand. There's not enough space here. I've thought of everything, as usual. There's some candy factory nearby, -Cosmos & Alien. -Cosmas & Damian. Cosmos, Cosmas. It's all the same. They are practically broke. They'll sell to me if I make a good offer. Not sure it'll be that easy, Mr. Armando. The old man, the owner of the factory, he won't let it go at all. It's been in his family for three generations. What's that got to do with me? The one thing that interests me is money. Besides, there's always one way or another to be persuasive. Didi, do you like me? -Yeah, I do. -But do you like me a lot? -Let's change the subject. -No. I need to know. -Do you really like me? -I really do. I really like you too, Didi. Sandrinha, who's this butt-face? Peeves, what are you doing here? -Did I surprise you? -Peeves, leave me alone. I don't leave anyone alone. Not even my sweet little sister. Let's go. You have my homework to do. Hey, leave her alone. She wants to play with me. Who do you think you are, punk? Doesn't matter who I am. You will leave Sandrinha alone. No one talks to me like that, shorty. Sandrinha, go home. It's going to get ugly. -Didi... -Do as I say. I see you later. This isn't over. I'm telling my dad. Go run to your daddy. I've always wanted to come, but Didi never brought me here. Cool place, huh? I wonder if they serve fries. The things you say. You're like a child. Isn't this place... super romantic? Anywhere is romantic with you. Wow, Felipe... you know how to talk to a woman. Just one second. I'll go powder my nose. I'll be right back. My first French kiss is about to happen. Dad, this insolent brat embarrassed me. How tall was he? This tall. So much smaller than you, Peeves. I think he was an MMA fighter. He beat me up. A lot. Nobody beats up Mr. Armando's son. That's right, Dad. Beat him good. No, I don't beat up children. I order the beating. Yes, sir. My son will point out to you the kid who needs to learn his lesson. Watch it. The beating shouldn't be rough. Just so he doesn't sit for 15 days. Thanks, Dad. Sandrinha. Sandrinha. -It's him. Beat him up. -Sandrinha. Nobody beats up my boss' son. -This is it? Hit him harder. -That's it. Take it. Hit him harder. -Go! This is an order. -Sorry. Enough is enough. Wow. I got hit so hard, I'm seeing things. Jeez! There. What...? Where did he go? Didi! Didi! Didi! -Felipinho. -You can't imagine what happened, Didi. You've figured it out. It wouldn't last forever. I'm an adult again, and you're a child. Just when I was about to score. -Score how? -I was about to score... -some gigs. My music, you know? -Right. Your music. You know, Felipe, I was really enjoying being a kid. Is the dream over, Didi? I don't know. I'm confused. Hey, dude. How's it going? I wanted to thank you. It's a cool kite. -I like it so much. -Like it, huh? You told me not to give up hope. I will always believe in my dreams. Glad to hear it. Is it any good? Any good? This kite's sick. Look how high it flies. Let me give it a go. Watch out for the house. Oh, God. -Be careful. -It'll get stuck. Oh, God, no. -My kite! -I'll go get it. It's too high up. Be careful. Didi! INTENSIVE CARE UNIT Tião, what happened to Didi? He went to get a kite, slipped, and fell off the roof. Is his life at risk, Tião? -I don't know. I... -Excuse me. He's coming. Doctor, how is he? Unfortunately, we tried our best, but he didn't make it. -What's wrong? -Didi is gone. I loved him like a son. How did he die? He went up to get-- -Surprise. -Didi! I never thought I'd miss these candies. Children don't know them anymore. This is it! Children know their stuff. -What are you talking about, Didi? -When I was a child again, I did what you advised me to do. And the boy said, "These candies are delicious." We have to advertise everywhere, change the packaging. Understood? That's what we have to do, guys. -This one. Look. -No. Not this one. -It's too much. -How about this one? Show him. -That's enough. -This last one. -This is it. Don't you think? -Yes, this is it. Want to switch candies? Come on. This one is yummier, healthier. And you too. Bye. Hey, guys. Have you tried this candy? Want to switch with me? Thanks. Have you tried this candy? Wanna switch? Thanks. Tasty, isn't it? Mr. Armando, I've heard the owner of the factory that you intend to buy has created new packaging, which may spoil your plans. It's better to look elsewhere for our expansion project. Are you insane? Absolutely not. We're expanding there. Who's deciding to get creative over there? Not the old man, is it? No, not at all. A guy named Didi. Here's a picture of him. Oh, and one more thing. There's a boy telling the other kids that the candies from our factory are bad for your health. Well, professor... I already know what to do. How's it hanging, guys? Yup, let's get working. How about you? How's your music? I'll be dead by the time it's a hit. Hey, don't you say that. Never give up on your dreams. You're too young for that. All this growing and shrinking that's been happening to us is an omen from God. A blessing. Don't you forget it. You have a long road ahead of you. You will be famous. How I wish I were a child again, I wouldn't make so many mistakes. It's cool to have a friend like you. I want to be friends forever. -Forever. -Forever. What's going on? -Put the hoods on. -Turn the lights on. Turn the lights on! I didn't call a cab. Turn the lights on! What about my human rights? Didi, where do you think we are? We're up the creek. -What are they going to do with us? -Stop with the questions. It raises suspicion. Untie the rope. Try untying the knot. I'll untie you. That's my belt. -Reach for the rope. -Those are my shorts. There. One hand is free. One to go. Look at this, Didi. "Golden Lollipop." It's that factory that puts chemical dyes in their candy. Dyes your tongue. Check those lollipops. It's full of DVDs. There's no lollipop. Wait a minute. If it's not lollipops, they're smugglers. It's piracy. Watch out. This is shady stuff. -Yeah. -Let's see what's on the other side. Yes, winning hand! You'll see my winning fist if you don't stop cheating. Way to go, Didi! Turn to the exit, Didi. Not the boxes. There's no way out, Didi. Busted! They blocked the exit, Didi. Get down, kid. I have a solution. Plan B. This is too slow. It's war! Hit it! But how did they get away? You're a bunch of incompetent crooks. You're all fired. Mr. Armando, the first candy with the new ingredient is ready. Professor Muller, who do you think you are to walk into my office unannounced? -But, sir-- -"But, sir" what? You're just another useless employee. -Hi, Daddy. What's up? -I have serious matters to attend to, kid. And you, professor, follow me. We need to have a private talk. You're fired. -Mr. Armando, you can't do this to me. -But I can. I have the secret formula. I don't need you anymore. Sandrinha? Sweetie? Sweetie. My sweetie. Hey, sweetie. Oh, God. What have I done? Sandrinha. My sweet baby, please, hang on. You don't know this, but you're very important to me, honey. What's the point of having everything without you? So much greed, lust for power... For what? I didn't see you grow up, sweetie. When you took your first step. I didn't see your first tooth. Because I was always in my office. Thinking only about money. I would give anything in the world to get you back. My baby girl. God, please, help me. CANDY FACTORY COSMAS & DAMIAN Come, sweetie. Is anyone there? Please, help me. Is anyone there? -Come in. -Mister. -Please, help me. My daughter is dying. -My God. There are people here who know about these things. One sec. I know it was you who saved me when I was dying in the hospital. There's a child out there who's dying too. Please, save her life. Or trade it for mine. I won't be missed by anyone. Her father is suffering. She needs to survive. She has barely started living. Save her life. Please. Bring the child here. This way, mister. Come in. They're waiting. -In here? -There's a bed there. We need warm water and blankets immediately. Help me out, sir. Warm water and blankets. Where? My baby girl. I know you. My factory is not a hotel for bums. Excuse me. A guy named Didi. Here's his picture. I never imagined, after all I've done to you, to be treated with so much care. I made mistakes. And I apologize. There's no need, sir. Didi! It's my dear friend, Tião. Come on. What's going on, Didi? -What's going on? -It's a miracle, sir. A miracle. I can explain. Tião. I'd be incredibly happy -if you would accept me as a partner. -Mr. Armando? I never thought I would ever hear this. Wait. Do you know each other? Yeah, Didi. I used to work at this factory. Many years ago, when I was young, but then I thought I knew more than Tião. I wanted to get rich, grow and succeed. So I opened my own venture. Water under the bridge. Water under the bridge. Let's have a celebration... You live here. You know Didizinho? Didizinho? No. I don't know him. You must really like this boy, huh? Don't be sad. Want a candy? No, thanks. No more candy today. Sandrinha! Didi. It was a great idea to put this show together. To promote our candies. I don't know why I didn't think about joining you before. It was Didi who came up with all this. -Yes, I know. -Oh, God... -Where did he go? -Calm down, Tião. I'm sure he'll show up. Isn't it supposed to be more crowded by now, Tião? What if the kids don't come? Calm down. We'll figure it out. Adriana. -How do I find Mr. Armando? -Why? What happened? The singer missed his flight and won't make it in time. Really? I'll take care of it. -No. -What? After so much work. I have a solution. I know a great singer who will be perfect for the show. -Where is he? -Can I go get him? Of course. Right away! I can't believe it. I'm a grown-up again. The dream isn't over. -Felipe. -Adriana. Felipe, this is your big break. They need a singer for the show, Felipe. I've never performed in public. That's what you wanted, right? You're good. You'll be fine. Look around, Mr. Armando. You're right, Mr. Armando. There is no one here. Look. Will the children come at least? No, no. -No? -We can't lose faith. You taught me that working with something you love -always does the trick. See? -Dad, look. -I'm too nervous. It's not going to work. -Calm down. Don't worry about it. Good luck. It happened to you too. Yeah. Are you going to sing? -Yeah. Let's make a toast. -I'm a kid. I don't drink. -No. A toast of candy. -Cool. Felipinho, it's happened again. Didi, I can't sing like this on stage. -Okay, calm down. -I can't. You don't have brains, do you? Don't you see? Our transformation comes from candy. I noticed a weird glow in them. -Let's have another. -And the toast? Forget about the toast. We're wasting time. Swallow yours. Didn't I say it was the candy? Now, get up there and kill it. Thanks, Didi. How did the song go? Encore! Encore! Encore! -Thank you. Bye, girls. -Bye. What's up, Didi? -All good? -Yeah. How many candies do you have left? -Only one. -So we have only one choice. Go back to our normal selves. -I'm not going to be a kid again. -It's not right to mess with nature. Being an adult is also really cool. You're right, Didi. I'm being selfish. We got into this together. We're ending this together. Not here. Follow me. Felipe, I'm having both candies. -Look at you. -Didi. Awesome, man. Didi. Felipe. You've already figured out who we are. Why is this happening to us over and over again? You two are very special. Especially you, Didi, who went above and beyond to revive the true spirit of this holiday. We've decided to grant your wishes through magic candies. We appear as humble people to sort out those with good hearts. You proved to be a good man. For that, you will be granted a special reward. Didi, you dropped a candy. I'd better take off. This thing is getting messed up. The party's going on till late. -Then Happy Cosmas & Damian's Day. -Hooray! What are you going to do with this candy? Throw it away. No more trouble. This poor girl looks so sad. Want a candy? Now the highlight of the night. We are going to raffle off this brand-new, amazing two-seat sports car, sponsored by Cosmas & Damian Candy Factory. And the winner is... number 11. Eleven. Is it you? Who's number 11? I'm number 11! It's me! Congratulations! I won the car, everybody. It's mine. Take the ribbon off the car. This must be the gift promised by Cosmas and Damian. Must be. Such a beautiful car. -Who is she? -Sandrinha. Are you really? Thank you, my dear saints. Thank you, dear friends. Catch you later. I have to keep my promise and place Cosmas and Damian's picture on this mirror. There. Now come here. -This candy tastes different. -Cut. Put your seat belt on. -I'm wearing Vasco's shirt underneath. -Cut. Swallow another one. -Careful not to go straight through. -Okay. Let's take it easy. Good candy. I've had about ten of them. Did it burst? Suicide! There are others over there. Let's aim at them. -So confusing. -Cut! -Got a light? -Cut. Not everyone turns ten on your birthday. Such a coincidence. This damn plane shows up every time we're shooting... You've already figured out who we are. I haven't figured out why this damn plane keeps disturbing us. Let us work in peace. -There's a newspaper here. -Cut. Passed the test. What's the point? I'll be dead by the time it's a hit. Poor kid. Professor Muller! Take your lines. I want to do more lines, but you don't. So take your candies. Professor Muller, how's the production going? Subtitle translation by Celina Castro Lisboa Dias
