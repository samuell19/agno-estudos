(Music Playing) (Singing) (Train Horn Sounding) (Announcement On Speaker) (Phone Ringing) Hello? Hello? Yes. I have reached. Okay. Fine. You were gathering evidences against us? Hit him. (Panting) (Sirens Wailing) (Door Opens) (Door Closes) Sir! - Sir! Suchiya, his identity? Impossible, sir. He's toast. He doesn't even look human anymore. Give. Sent it to forensic. Okay, sir. Sir, this incident took place close to his shop. I didn't see anything, sir. I had locked up and gone home long back. I swear. (Sobbing) Let him go. Go. Get lost. Bless me, father. Great. So you are finally awake. I hope sleeping didn't tire you, son. I would be tired only if I had slept properly. Power outrage takes place whenever I plan to get some sleep. Damn the electricity board employees! Harvansh Kaur.. Look, your son is cursing me. I am not cursing you. I am cursing the electricity board employees. And who am I? You are my father. (Chuckles) Tony and uncle Bhola are the electricity board employees. They never face power outrage. Even if there a power outrage, they have a generator for it. So they are the real electricity board employees, right? Okay. Today I learnt that. I have been working there for 18 years unnecessarily. Hey, my son is awake. Bless me, mother. God bless you. Go and get ready quickly. Oh, I forgot. The car is already here and you guys are still not ready. I will be ready in five minutes. Give tea to the driver, in the meanwhile I will get ready. - Okay. Wear a turban. In the meanwhile, I will make tea for the driver. Hurry up. How much longer will it take? 'Bansa, what have you done!' 'Look, this is wrong.' (Gun Firing) 'Anyone who stands before me, dies.' 'Who are you?' 'Stay in your limits!' (Water Sloshing) (Growls) 'He is dead.' 'What have I done!' 'How could I do this?' 'What have you done, brother?' 'You have done nothing.' 'What are you saying?' 'Keep quiet.' 'You are under my oath.' 'You won't tell anyone about this.' 'Do you understand?' 'Jeeta?' 'That's it.' (Sirens Wailing) No, Jeeta. No. You don't belong there. You belong over here. In my heart. You have done for me what no one in this world does for anyone. Your our brother a hug and give him some peace. (Crying) No, brother. Don't cry. No, brother. Don't cry. Look sister-in-law, he is crying. - Hello, uncle. God bless you. Ranjeet. My son. God bless you. Hello, sister-in-law. - God bless you. (Bangles sound) Till I don't hear your bangles, I don't feel awake. A penny for your thoughts, brother. What are you looking at? Nothing. I was just looking at the stars. I can see them during the day today. Okay, the stars. I thought you are looking at the moon. Stupid girl. Moon, during the day? It shows up during the day sometimes. You better mend your ways. Okay. Why should I bother? I had just come to give you milk. You can look at the moon or the stars all you want. Deepi! Where are you? Look, the loudspeaker has started. Fine. Where were you? My throat has gone sore shouting. I had gone to wake up brother. Why wake him up? It's not as if he has some job to do. You should have first finished doing your job. All the household chores are yet to be done. Our courtyard is dirty. Who will clean it? Stop it, dear. Why do you always keep shouting at the children? You better keep quiet. You shouldn't spoil your children. If she doesn't learn household chores now.. ..then what will she do after she goes to her in-laws' house? They will hold her by her plait and throw her out. Don't say bad things. You shouldn't stress yourself like this. And you should scold at young girls. Sure. I am the only one who is bad. There is something wrong with me that I look after them. No matter how much I do, I will still be a stepmother. It's okay, dear. Take this. Offerings. Come with me. Enough. We have had enough. Today, he will not be spared. What happened? Why are you upset? What will I be if not upset? The black bull caused a mess again. You guys only keep talking. You should drown yourself. You didn't respect the samosas I fed you. Don't worry. We will handle him. Let's go. Where is he? He got scared of me and ran away. If I had gotten hold of him then I would have beaten him up. Dollar? But he didn't come to college today. Why did you make me carry a hockey if he didn't come to college? It's okay. We will take care of him. Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. Look, that tiny fellow is coming. Bye, brother. - Bye. Let me know. - Yes, of course. - Hold this. Welcome. We were just thinking about you guys. I know you guys. You must be gossiping. How do you know, brother? Your roguish faces tell us everything. Now that's a face to remember. (Music Playing) "Your bangles keep troubling me at night." "The imp keeps kissing you." "Your bangles keep troubling me at night." "The imp keeps kissing you." "My heart wishes to break all barriers hold back love." "This boy from Amritsar, is crazy about you." "This boy from Amritsar, is crazy about you." "I stay high without drinking." "I swear on God." "There is a lot of beauty in this world." "But there is no one like you." "My heart fears of losing you." "It loves you boundlessly." "My eyes cannot survive without your sight." "This boy from Amritsar, is crazy about you." "This boy from Amritsar, is crazy about you." "Your killer eyes have made many lovers go crazy." "People fight the world for love, they fought with God." "I want you to wear my wedding bangles." "Please don't betray me, my love." "My heart is eager to make you mine." "This boy from Amritsar, is crazy about you." "This boy from Amritsar, is crazy about you." "This boy from Amritsar, is crazy about you." It's so late. He still hasn't come home. Go to sleep, Harvansh Kaur. For how long will you stay awake? He will come back when he is done loitering around. But he has never been so late before. Call up him once. Once? I have already called him up 10 times. But his phone is switched off. I wonder where my son is. I am worried for him. (Footsteps Receding) Father, what are you doing over here? You didn't go to sleep? What is it, Deepi? What happened? (Sighs) Nothing, brother. Bankers had come. They took the tractor. Father is upset because of that. That's all. No, father. Don't worry. They have just taken away the tractor. They cannot take away our fate. We will get another one. Don't feel sad. Sad? Can I say something? Nothing can make a jat sad. A loan? A Jat burdened with a loan from the time he is born. I don't know why, from the time they took the tractor.. I am getting a feeling that someone has taken away my son from me. One keeps seeing good days and bad days. Bad days have gone away, now soon good days will come. I just have this one year of studies left. Then everything will get settled. Now wipe your tears and go to bed. Go ahead and feed him dinner. After all, he has won a medal. He has made my life miserable. He keeps loitering around till late night. If he continues behaving like this then.. ..he will surely get us into trouble one day. I don't want to eat. I am not hungry. No, son. Don't say that. Look, you shouldn't mind your parents' scolding. Come on, eat. I am unfortunate, mother. Whenever I try to do something good, something bad happens with me. What bad happened with you? Tell me. What bad happened today? It was my friend's birthday. While returning from there, I found someone who had met with an accident. I took him to the hospital. What wrong did I do in that? I don't know why God is being so cruel to me. No, don't say that. You didn't do anything wrong. God will set everything right for you. He won't go anything good for me. And this is reason why I shall fight with Him one day. No, don't say that. You know we have got you after praying a lot to God. But I cannot tolerate these taunts every day. Fine. Enough now. - No. No one will taunt you henceforth. Okay? No one will taunt. Eat, at least now. - Okay. I know.. I very well know that my son is a very capable man. He will win many medals for me. You will, won't you? I will, mother. But we won't give a single medal to father. (Chuckles) We won't give a single medal. We won't tell your father about it. - Better. Okay? - Yes. Now eat. Okay? Come on. The job wasn't done, brother. I think it will take some time. Jaswinder, time is something that I don't have! I think I only will have to do something about it. Okay, brother. Here, son. Have freshly made bread. Enough, mother. I am full. - But.. How are your studies going on? - Good. Don't feel shy to ask if you need anything. Take money from me when you need them. Okay, father. Harvansh Kaur, feed pure clarified butter to him. - Yes. He has become weak. What did you feed him last night? I think father has finally grown up. (Chuckles) Right? I told you, you shouldn't feel bad about what he says. How did he change so suddenly? I told you, my brother is very good. (Chuckles) Fine. Now eat. Bye, mother. I am going to college.. Hold on. Now what? Hold on a minute. Mother.. You can forget anything else but not this. How can I forget? After all I am a mother. This keeps you away from all evil. You are the best mother. God bless you. Go. Stop. Stop over here. - Okay. (Bike Engine Sound) Stop, brother. I am very late. Listen.. Again singing chorus? You know everything.. You also know what the situation is at home. It's not as if I like to sing chorus behind the lead singer. You are impossible. Here, take my book with you. See you in the evening. Okay. Come to pick me up. - See you in the evening. (Bike Engine Sound) Debay? - Yes, brother? Get flour from Manjeet's flourmill. - Fine. Don't forget. - I won't. Please wait. - Oh no. Wait. - Now what? "Now what?" - Yes. You always forget to take your medicine. You forgot today as well. Come on, open your mouth. Here you go. Drink some water. Don't take such good care of me. I will get spoilt. Sister-in-law, I wanted to ask you something. Go ahead. Do all wives take such good care of their husbands like you do? Debay, it is every wife's duty to look after her husband. To serve him. - Okay. Why did you ask that? I was thinking that.. If I.. (Chuckling) Let it be. (Chuckling) So you were enjoying Bhanghu's songs. There are many requests but we don't have much time. We have to go to Barnala to perform next. So, coming before you with the last song.. The pride and honor of Punjab.. The strong voice of Punjab.. Dharamveer Bhanghu. (Crowd Applauding) Here you go, sir. Okay, so on my brothers' request.. I am going to sing a few lines from my upcoming album. Please pay attention. Mona, pick it up from the second. Yes, okay. "Look, this boy has become crazy." "He has started following me." "He has let go of all shame." "He says, I shall never get a like you." "He comes close to me and says.. - I love you!" "He says I love you!" "He comes close to me and says.. - I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" "He says I love you!" - "I love you!" Sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni-sa.. - Look, sir is here. Bless me. Hello, sir. - Hello. You didn't practice well. You should practice. - Okay, sure. That's all, sir? What else do you want? A buffalo? Go away. - He always pays stingily. The arrangements are great, uncle. There are so many elephants here. Ranjeet, what's the rent of this palace? It is very expensive. Not for people like you and me. Why not? We will get you married in a grand style in this palace. Really? It was a good program. - Yes, it was good. Bye. - Okay. Bye. - Bye, Gurtej. Bye. - Bye. How are you? Hello, uncle. - Hello. You know many girls. You are famous. You must be having a lot of fun. No fun, uncle. They are artists. We do cultural programs together. Really? Listen.. - Yes. Come closer. Do you have their phone numbers? Phone number? Uncle, why do you need their phone number? I am not asking it for myself. Won't we need them for your wedding? We don't have any entertainment during your wedding? Forget about my wedding. You leave for the village. I will drop him and come. Then why did you ask me to come here? To show you the glamour. Bye, uncle. Bye. - Bye. Bye. There is someone is my distant relation. I had met her during a wedding. She was wearing jeans and goggles. She was beautiful. Just like Madhuri Dixit. She has done the JBT course. She is a teacher. If she agrees then things might work out for you, Debay. Sister-in-law, how old is she? What do you have to do with her age? Tell me if you wish to go ahead. I will send your proposal. No. I mean what if her knees don't work? What if she comes and makes you serve her? No, no, no. It is not so. She goes to school to teach every day, on foot. Really? In which city does she teach? She is from Chandigarh. She is teaching in a government school. Okay. "Get me married!" Okay, okay. "Get me on the horse!" Sister-in-law, then you shouldn't bother. Why? Boys say that girls from Chandigarh are impossible. Really. They don't buy cell phones less than Rs. 50,000. They go to the beauty palor twice in a month for a haircut. How will I be able to take her to salons? Let it be. You don't like any girl. Sister-in-law! - What is it? Find someone from here, close by. Fine, I will. - Yes, she agreed. "Get me married!" She agreed. Debay! Listen.. - Coming! Coming right away! I will do all the work. I will do it right away. Lord Almighty. I seek your blessings, father. God bless you. You are back, son. - How are you feeling now? Better. Then, you should pat your son's back. Why, have you won a medal? Uncle, your nephew cleared the exams. Congratulations. Really? - Yes. God bless you, my son. (Chuckling) You have made me happy. Come here, give me a hug. (Chuckling) Now give me some sweets. Here you go, father. Brother, have you really cleared your exams? Then what! What about sweets for me? This one is for you and this one is for you. (Chuckling) Here, have some sweets. I have cleared the exams. Now I will soon get a job. I suggest you start making preparations. To apply henna on your hands. To wear wedding bangles. And to marry me. (Music Playing) "My eyes never get tired of admiring your beauty." "My eyes never get tired of admiring your beauty." "My heart desires you.." "My heart desires you.." "What else do I tell you?" "My eyes never get tired of admiring your beauty." "My eyes never get tired." "My eyes never get tired of admiring your beauty." "Without a word from you, I know how you feel." "Such is our situation." "If you get angry.." "I feel as if the world is angry with me." "As if the world is angry with me." "Never be angry with me." "Just be faithful with me." "No matter how many sorrows we have to face." "My eyes never get tired of admiring your beauty." "I am crazy about you." "Crazy about you." "I am crazy about you." "My heart is crazy about you." "When the moon rises, it takes the darkness away." "My love, your presence brings dawn to my life." "Your presence brings dawn to my life." "You being away from me.." "Is something that I cannot tolerate." "I will be left with nothing." "My eyes never get tired of admiring your beauty." (Bike Engine Sound) (Engine Sound) Stop! Stop! Stop! Where to? We have come here for an interview. Interview for what? The position has already been filled. How can the position be filled just like that? Do you have money? Do you have any recommendations? If you don't, then get out of here. There is something called as talent as well. I will talk to them. I told you! Get out of here. Pick up your talent and get lost from here. People like you show up every day. Son.. So what have you thought? What's left to think? I thought I would get a job. I would repay father's loan. I would get my sister married. Everything is over now. We will have to do something, brother. Otherwise, nothing will work out. (Crying) Brother! What happened? Why are you crying? What happened? Why are you crying? Brother.. Father.. Father..! (Crying) Father..! Father..! Ranjeet? Yes, mother? Where are you going so early in the morning? I am going to end this for once and for all, mother. But where are you going? I am going Harmandir Sahib. Today I will return only after settling the score with Him. Go, my son. Come back on time. Okay, mother. Go. 'Oh Lord Almighty!' 'The owner of this world..' 'We have come to pray before You.' 'We cannot tolerate the taunts of this world anymore.' 'There is no aim in our life.' 'Please show us the right direction today.' 'Either give us the aim of our life or end our life.' Watch out! Be careful, sir. God bless you, son. What happened? Let's go. That elderly man.. The elderly man? What about him? He was.. Tell me, what happened? When I supported him, I felt a talisman around his arm. A talisman? So what's the big deal? Have you gone crazy? How can a baptized Sikh wear a talisman? It's nothing. Let's go. Come with me.. - But.. (Engine Starting) Why are you running? He's the same guy, the one wearing a talisman. What do you have to do with him? Man.. You come with me. Just come with me. - What do we have do with this? (Bike Engine Sound) Sir, I want to discuss something very important with you. Okay. I had gone to Harmandir Sahib to pay homage. I came across a senior citizen there. He slipped on the stairs and I supported him. When I supported him, I noticed that.. He had a talisman tied around his arm. He was wearing a talisman, so? He was a baptized Sikh. How can a baptized Sikh wear a talisman? Son, a lot of Sikhs have digressed. They wear talismans. They worship idols. They visit Pundits. They have all digressed. He too must have digressed. Sir, you don't understand. You listen to me. Now what do you want me to do? Should I ask him to remove the talisman? Sir, this isn't about the talisman. I think he is not a good man. Son, the way you two are behaving is not good either. Please hear us out, sir. No, you listen to me. There is no law or section under which I can ask a person to remove his talisman. Do you understand? Sir, please. - Please leave. Just a minute. - Please leave. Go away! Leave. Suchiya, make them leave. Go away! Happy now? You got us insulted. Do you want us to get a little more insulted? He is very arrogant. And why should you bother if someone is wearing a talisman? At least you try to understand me. I spoke about it because I thought it was fishy. Fine, you are right. Let's go now. Unnecessarily.. Sister-in-law! Where are you? Upstairs. What happened? Why are you shouting? What are you making? I am making sun-dried green gram dumplings for you. You can only make dumplings for me. You cannot find a match for me. Your match will be made. But we need to find someone who matches perfectly for you. What can we say about matches? Something can happen only if you want. Find me a bombshell, please. Who hides her face under a veil.. ..and fills the courtyard with the sound of her anklets. Oh yes, anklets remind me. Lambar's Bishan had sent a proposal, but.. Let it be. Why should I let it be? Please tell me. She still studies. Am I a monkey that I will tear her books? She can continue studying after marriage too. Yes, you are right. But there is a problem. She starts talking about something and she says there's a problem. Hey, you tell me. What is wrong with you? You are smart, tall and a handsome young man. (Chuckling) Tell me? Then what is the problem? What do I tell you? The girl.. - Yes? She doesn't have a mother? No. Both her parents are alive. Then is she shortsighted? No. She sees just fine. But.. - But what? She wears an artificial leg.. "Someone beautiful.." "Someone charming.." - Okay. "Someone beautiful.." "Someone charming.." "Get me a wife." So tell me. "Get me married." Then let it be. "Get me on a horse." You just want to keep making dumplings. You don't want to get me married. (Laughing) Give me another. - Here you go. Hello. - Hello. Bye. Here's your money. Sorry, brother. Hello! Brother! You dropped something. Hello! Brother! Brother, you left something behind. Listen to me, brother! Strange. (Bike Engine Sound) Wait! Where are you going! (Door Opens) What happened? Who was it? Uncle, they were thieves. - What happened, son? They ran away. Don't worry. Nothing happened. I am here for you. But why did thieves come to our house? Sister-in-law, thieves must have come to steal. Do you think they came with a marriage proposal for me? Is everything in place? Everything is in place. They wanted my pant. What? - Oh no. Okay, okay, okay. I understood. They must be druggies of our village. They must be looking for money. What else can it be? Son, you should sleep with us downstairs, tonight. Come with me. - Let's go. Are you alright? - I am fine. How did they climb upstairs? - Let's go inside. You don't need to worry as I am here, brother. I can die for you. Who is there? (Phone Ringing) Hello? Ranjeet? - Yes. Who are you? You don't need to know that. Listen to what I have to say. You have a piece of paper with you. I want it to be with me by tomorrow evening. Really? What if I don't give it to you? Your father works for the electricity board, right? He checks electricity meters. He stays out during the day. He might get crushed under a truck. Listen to me! You are threatening me? If you have the courage then come before me and talk to me. Calm down. I'll call you up and let you know where and when you need to deliver that paper. Hello? Hello? Stop it. Don't try to get inside it. This is a blank paper. It does not contain anything. Even I know that. But last night people came home to steal it. And I got a threatening call in the morning. There is something fishy, brother. Was this paper treated using a scientific method? It is possible that it shows under a light. What do you say? I told you, there is nothing in it. I am sure you are mistaken. (Phone Ringing) Hello? At 5:00pm. Hall Gate's backside market. Hang up and be there. (Bike Engine Sound) (Car Horn Honking) The paper? Give it to her. Wait for me. I will be right back. Wait for my signal. Be careful. You? Why are you following me? Don't misunderstand me. I just want to know what's in this paper. Look, I don't know who you are. But I would advice you to go back where you came from. I will leave, just tell me what's in that paper. Get this straight. If I shout, everyone in this area will come here. You don't know what will happen to you. Really? Then why don't you shout? Heed my advice. Save yourself. Go away from here. Tell me what's in that paper and I will leave. Please heed my advice, brother. Go away. Save yourself. Go away. (Bike Engine Sound) Gurtej! (Gun Firing) (Gun Firing) Take the paper from him. Remove his helmet. Are you alright? - Yes. We lost him. It's okay. We still have the letter. Today, because of us someone is dead. Someone is died, but we didn't kill her. It is our fault somehow or the other. Now I am sure about one thing. Whatever it is, it is very big. Do you agree with me now? I told you, there is something fishy. Ranjeet, but there is something to think about. If they can die for this piece of paper.. Then they can do anything to get it back. (Phone Ringing) Hello? A mistake. A very big mistake. You will be punished. Start gathering wood. You are about to lose a member of your family. Hello? Hello? Hello? Whose call was it? Them. Sister-in-law.. Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law.. Sister-in-law.. What is it? Did you talk to them? What about? "Get me married." The same we were talking about the other day. "Get me on a horse." What did I say? No.. Weren't you talking about the one who.. "Get me married." What are you doing? "Get me on a horse." - The one who is.. Okay! The one from Kapurthala? That day you said she was Kotkapura. Yes, so? Talk to them, if it works out. But that you said that you have nothing to do with a divorce. No. But sister-in-law, now my brain tell me.. ..that if that poor girl was left by her husband.. ..then what is her fault in that? And then, you will help her bring up that child. (Laughing) Fine, I will to them. Please get me married. But you shouldn't back out later. No, I won't, I swear. I swear on you.. Look Satveer.. Yes sir. The transformer should be placed at Fatehwal by tomorrow. It is being loaded sir. It will be placed soon enough. - Very good. Watch out, I don't want any excuses. Okay, sir. The transformer should be in place by tomorrow. Okay, sir. - Okay? I am leaving now. - Okay. No! What happened? What happened, son? Mother? What are you doing here at this hour? I was watching you sleep. I think you had a bad dream. I don't know, mother. I have not been getting proper sleep since the past few days. Mother.. Please sing the lullaby you used to sing to me when I was a baby. Fine, okay. I will sing it for you. (Singing) "May you always dwell under cool shade." "May you always dwell under cool shade." "This is what I always pray to God for." Brother? Drink some milk. Why do you hide and bring milk for me? And then, you get scolded. I am not worried about the scolding. I am worried about my brother. What's wrong, brother? You look very sad. It's nothing, sister. I am just missing father. I have to fulfill his dreams. I have to get you married. I won't leave my brother. Do you understand? Stupid girl. Why won't you? Deepi! Coming! (Phone Ringing) Yes, Ranjeet? They had called. Come over quickly. Okay, I am coming. (Door Opens) (Bangles sound) Are you sure this is the place? Yes, this is the place. Do you know what you have to do? Yes, I will handle it. You go. Okay. - Bye. (Car Brakes Squeaking) (Door Opens) Give it to me. (Door Closes) Brother.. (Door Opens) Langar Hall. Dukh Bhanjani Beri. Darshani Deori (main entrance). And.. Akal Takht. I have seen one of them before. Where? Oh, yes. The guy with the letter. The one who banged into me at the market. His letter fell. I went behind him to give the letter. When he saw me, he got scared and started running. This means this person has seen you somewhere before. Where? Come with me. (Sirens Wailing) Come with me, sir. This is the place. Suchiya. - Yes, sir. Check. - Follow me. Come on. Okay. - Two of you go there and check. You come with me. Randeep, go and check. - Okay, sir. Let's go. Boys! - Yes? Check the place thoroughly. - Yes. Check every nook and corner. - Okay, sir. Check carefully. - Sir.. Move things around and check. - This is the room, sir. Here.. Here.. Here, there was a map. Sir, that man.. he was standing over here. We saw them from this window. There were a lot of things over here. Sir, everything has changed over here. - Yes. Sir. - Suchiya, did you find anyone? No, sir. How can we find anyone here? This place stinks so badly that it's enough to kill anyone. Sir, this is nothing serious. They are idlers. They don't have any jobs. They are seeking entertainment. So, there is no one over here. Believe us, sir. We stood there and saw them. They were over here. If you saw them then where are they now? We are telling the truth. There were six of them. Six men. They looked like Sikhs. But they weren't Sikhs. - Yes, sir. They weren't Sikhs, they were dressed up as Sikhs. You scoundrels! You have made me go crazy! You sometimes say that they were Muslims. And you sometimes say that they were Sikhs. You rascals, your statements don't match. You come to the police station every second day. Is the police sitting idle? We aren't lying. - Shut up. You rascals, get this straight. If I see you anywhere close to the police station.. ..I will beat you both black and blue. Sir.. - Shut up. Shut up. Let's go, Suchiya. Let's go. Behave yourself. Sangrand (new month) is approaching. I don't understand where they went! The mark is here. They are very clever. This is not as small as we think it is, brother. Right. But who will trust us? How will we prove this? I don't know. But now it concerns a Gurudwara. We needed a job, right? He has given us a job now. Let's go. Khalsa belongs to Lord. - Victory belongs to Lord. Please have a seat. Tell me, how are you doing? I am doing great. Manager, is the agreement ready? I prepared it long back. I just need your signatures on it. Give it here. I'll sign them right away. Please read them, sir. What are you saying? I don't need to read them. This is a service to a Gurudwara. Only fortunate ones get a chance to do it. Okay then take Lord's name and sign them. Here you go. - Give it to me. Felicitate him with a Siropa (turban). This is not required. This is Gurudwara's blessings. Blessed are those.. Those who take the name of Lord. Khalsa belongs to Lord. - Victory belongs to Lord. Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. Oh, Lord Almighty! What do we do now? What can we do? He is the one who showed us the way. He is the one who will guide us to our destiny. Now He holds our strings. He will do everything right. Look over there, isn't he the one? Yes, I think he is one of them. Wait, I will strangle him. Not yet. It's daytime. There are a lot of people here. Let's wait till the sun sets. We will handle him. (Door Closes) The shop closed. Ranjeet, as soon as I signal you, come there with the tempo. Come on. - Let's go. Let's go, hurry up. Who are you? - Wait, wait. Who are you? - Be careful. Hurry up. Close the door. - Stop. Where have you brought me? And what do you want? Look, I don't have much time to talk. Quickly tell me what your plan is. Plan? What plan? I don't understand. Don't make me angry. You very well know what I want to hear. I don't know what you want. Speak up! He won't speak up so easily. Speak up! - I don't know anything. Tell us what your plan is! I said I don't know anything. Speak up! - No! Now ask him. The way you have boxed him, I doubt he will wake up before tomorrow morning. I have told you so many times not to hit anyone? But at least tell us what has he done? Shut up. Shinde, you should leave. Your father must be getting worried. Yes, brother. Listen my father.. - Let's go. I am leaving, brother. - Let's go. (Phone Ringing) Hello? Yes, mother? Where are you? You didn't call or inform us. Gurtej and I had come to the city to meet Shinde. His sister is getting married. He forced us to stay here. We will be back in a few days. But you should have informed me about it. You don't have any clothes or money with you. I have some money. Don't worry. I'll come back and meet you in a day or two. Okay. Take care. And keep calling me. Okay, mother. Bye. Okay, son. (Water Sloshing) No.. Look, you still have time. Tell us the truth. Otherwise.. Speak up! Speak up! Speak up! Stop it or he will die. He won't speak up so easily. You..! Speak up! - Babble out! I wonder what he is made of. But it's important for us to find out what their plan is. Here. You are here. - Yes. Okay. Any news on Harnek? - No, brother. He didn't go home at night. I went to his shop as well. It is closed. Then where did he go? Did he disappear into thin air? Is his phone on? - No, brother. It is switched off. I think something is wrong. If we don't know where he is by tomorrow.. ..then you should change the whole program. Okay, brother. Any other orders for us? Isn't he the one? Free service of fireworks and decoration. He is the one. But why did he take the service of lighting up the.. ..Darbar Sahib and doing the fireworks? I told you something is fishy. - Right. (Car Horn Honking) (Bike Engine Sound) We still don't have any news on Harnek, brother. I think Intelligence is behind it. I fear, our mission might.. 10 years! It took me 10 years to be where I am today. To make a status for myself. To make a position for myself in this city. It has been 10 years since I met my family. I still remember their faces which await me. When I came here, I said I will do so much.. ..that seven generations of ours won't have to work to survive. And you? Have you forgotten everything? You used to ride rickshaw in Kutch. And now you own buses. And you? You had a small restaurant. Now you and your family lack nothing. You got everything. Everyone got everything. Don't bow your head. Look up. Forget.. forget it! There is no turning back now. We have come so far that if we make even the smallest of mistakes.. ..then neither will those faces survive.. ..nor those families, nor those eyes. Come in. Open your eyes! Brothers.. - Come on. Some food and clothes for you. Change your clothes, you guys are stinking. It has been three days. Did he say anything? He didn't leave him in a state to speak up. He gave him such a punch that he still didn't wake up? I request you to take him away from here. My father will throw me out if he finds out about this. Tell them. - Yes, his father will throw him out. He isn't going anywhere. Show him his father's photo. Now, do you recognize him? Speak up. Brother, I think he needs a repeat service. He will then start speaking up. Tell me something, what has he done? Why? You..! Brother.. Tell them. He is very stubborn. We have beaten him black and blue yet he hasn't spoken a word. Brother, I hope you aren't doing anything illegal. Brother.. Brother.. Don't worry. We aren't doing anything illegal. Dollar? He is right. - Sure? They aren't doing anything illegal. Close the door on your way out. - Yes, we will. You..! - Let's go. Speak up! Speak up! Speak up! Speak up! Harpal.. - Yes, brother? Make something that can be heard till Delhi. Ranjeet, where are these wires coming from? Come, let's go and check. (Phone Ringing) Yes, brother? Jagjeet? You still haven't come here? My job is done. I am coming soon. Come soon, we have to leave. Yes, hurry up. - Okay. (Door Opens) (Door Closes) You..! Get it out! Get it out of your mouth! Get it out! Give it here. Tell us! Tell us what your plan is! No matter what you do, you won't hear the evening Jakara (ovation). Langar Hall. Dukh Bhanjani Beri. Akal Takht Sahib. This is the place. This is the place. Find it. Find it. It is over here. What is this? This is what we were looking for. But how will we defuse it? This isn't our cup of tea, brother. We'll have to find the rest of the bombs and take them away from the Gurudwara. And we have to this before the Jakara. But they don't call out the Jakara at the Darbar Sahib. But it is said at the Akal Takht Sahib. Five minutes after prayers are said at the Darbar Sahib.. ..prayers are said at the Akal Takht Sahib and then call out the Jakara. We have to save the Gurudwara, brother. We don't have much time. Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. Jagjeet still hasn't come. Call him up. - Okay, brother. (Phone Beeps) (Phone Ringing) What happened? He isn't answering it. Give it to me. "He isn't answering it." He isn't answering the phone? Sukhwinder. - Yes? Quickly go and check. You too go. - Okay, brother. Call me up. - Okay. Okay? - Okay, brother. Check over there. I will be right back. - Okay. What are you looking at? Can you see that bag? It has been hanging there from quiet some time. Devotees are coming, having a bath and leaving. But no one is taking that bag. Come with me. Keep the bag there, or they will suspect us. Let's go. - Let's go. Jagjeet! - Jagjeet! It's not here. (Phone Beeps) (Phone Ringing) Come out.. Yes, tell me. Brother, Jagjeet.. Jagjeet. What happened to Jagjeet? Someone killed Jagjeet, brother. And the parcel is also missing. What did you say? The parcel is missing? This means they have reached there. Listen to me very carefully. - Okay. Go to all the places and check properly and find them! Our mission shouldn't fail. Okay, brother. "Lord Almighty." 'Oh great Guru Ramdas..' 'Help us during this troubled time.' 'Be generous to us.' 'Help us, my master.' 'Guide us.' 'Have mercy.' 'You are our only support.' 'Have mercy on us.' 'Get us out of this troubled situation.' 'Get rid of this trouble.' 'You are our only support.' 'Have mercy, Lord.' (Phone Ringing) Yes, tell me. Hello brother, there is a problem? There is a problem? The parcel at Dukh Bhanjani Beri is missing. And the parcel at Langar Hall is also missing. What are you saying? I am telling the truth. Now listen to me very carefully. - Okay. (Door Opens) (Door Closes) It is not so easy. It is not so easy to uproot us! Just a few more moment and then.. boom! I think you aren't aware of our history. You should try going through the past pages of history. Whenever someone has tried to have evil intentions about our Gurudwaras.. ..we have made them meet the ground. I swear by this holy place, I shall tear you apart today. Get up! Come on! (Swords Swishing) Let's go. Come on! (Screaming) We don't have much time. The prayers have already begun at Darbar Sahib. Now prayers will begin at Akal Takht Sahib. We don't have much time. Let's go quickly. - Let's go. Listen to me! Keep them down. Keep them down! Keep the explosives down. I will shoot you. Why are you staring at each other? Keep them down. Listen to me! Keep them down. You are misunderstanding us, sir. Keep the explosives down. Please listen to us. I don't want to listen to you. I will shoot you if you try to act funny. Please listen to us, sir. Why don't you listen to me? I will shoot you. Keep them down. - Sir! Please sir! I will shoot you! (Gun Firing) Hello, mother. Hello, son. I seek your blessings. - God bless you. Congratulations on arrival of your grandson. - Congratulations to you too. Are you alright? Are you feeling better, Gurmeet? Thank you so much. Hello. Hello. Very good, my baby. Oh, Lord Almighty! Oh, Lord Almighty! Oh, Lord Almighty! Did your mother scold you? It's okay. 'Keep watching us for updates.' 'PTC News Amritsar.' Gurmeet.. I will be right back. Suchiya! Come with me. Hurry up. - Sir is calling. I'll call you back. Hurry up. Come with me. Hurry up. Our child wasn't a terrorist. This is a mistake. Hurry up. Let's go. Oh God.. - Brother, run! Run! Hurry up! - Hit them! Run away from here! - Oh God! (Crying) What has happened! Oh God! Why are we facing this day? Oh God! My son cannot do this. Why are we facing this day, God? We have been ruined. Debay! We have lost everything. How did this happen! How did this happen! Calm down. Calm down. - My son is no more. My son is no more. Don't cry, sister-in-law. Calm down. Why did we have to face this calamity? Oh God, where is my son? Snehal Singh! Snehal Singh! Leave this village within two days! Or else, we'll beat you up with our shoes and throw you out. There is no place in our village for traitors of our community. Such a bad offspring! Such a bad child! You have betrayed your community. There is no place in our village for traitors of Gurudwara. Get out! Get out! We won't let you stay in this village. You should feel ashamed. - Shut up. Traitors of Gurudwara, come out! Now we cannot escape! We cannot escape death! We are facing bad days. He has brought them shame. - No! He has ruined their lives. He has destroyed us. We cannot even leave our own house. Oh God.. They tried to attack the Darbar Sahib! Oh sinners, why did I have to be in association? We cannot escape death now! They will stone us to death. Oh God, which well should I jump into? Sir, they are the five devotees these terrorists killed. Not five, six. Six. Not six, sir. There are only five of them. There is a sixth. Find him. Find him. Keep moving. Go. Stop. Make everyone queue up. Your RC book? - Sir. Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind, sir. Is everything fine? - Yes, sir. If you suspect anyone, arrest him. - Sir. Okay, sir. 'This incident at Darbar Sahib has shocked the Sikh community.' Sir.. - 'People are very angry.. - You should eat your meal. after this unfortunate incident.' 'There are protest marches taking places at many places.' You go ahead and eat, Suchiya. I am not hungry. - 'They are also shouting slogans.' 'In rage, people burnt the effigies traitors of the community.' 'And they also threw stones at their houses.' 'High alert has been issued in Punjab.. ..taking the current situation into consideration.' 'We still don't know all the details about this attack.' 'Why did they in spite of being Sikhs..' '..betrayed their community by attacking the Gurudwara?' 'We tried to talk to their families.' 'But they refused to speak to the media.' 'The community is demanding rigorous punishment for families.' You are our only support. Guide us. 'We cannot say anything else until this case is solved.' (Phone Ringing) 'For more updates stay tuned to PTC News, Amritsar.' - Hello. Keep guarding him. I am coming. Hurry up, Suchiya. Give me the keys. Let's go. Get the car. - Sir! Let's go! Hurry up, everyone. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! (Sirens Wailing) Hurry up! Let's go! Let's go! Sir! - Get in quickly! Let's go. Start the car! Let's go. This way, sir. He is in here. Don't spare him. There he is. He is the one, sir. My friends had brought him here. Sir, there is something that he knows but won't tell anyone. My friends are innocent, sir. They are innocent. I know, son. I know everything. Stupid.. You have relieved me of great burden with your phone call. You don't know how big a favor you have done to me. (Sobbing) They beat him black and blue but he doesn't utter a word. He shall speak. He will start talking. He will talk like a parrot. Suchiya, take him with us. - Okay, sir. Let's go. - Come on. Let's go. Sucha.. Start talking quickly. If you don't, then I swear, I won't stop. Bashir Mohammad, Girnur Gila village, Karachi, Pakistan. Sir, we had been given a mission.. ..to blast bombs inside Harmandir Sahib on Diwali.. ..and massacre Sikhs. So that it causes a rift between Hindu, Sikhs and Muslims. To make them fight each other. To disturb the peace of this place. To divide it. We wanted to do what Blue Star couldn't do. Sir, he is Muslim! He cannot be a Muslim! The place, the abode which they conspired to blow up.. ..it's foundation was laid by a Muslim fakir, Sai Mian Mir. How can he be a Muslim? They don't have any caste or creed. For some money and some false dreams, he can do anything. Disgusting! Because of.. Because of few such people, we are being separated from our dear ones. Why? Till when? They weren't traitors. They weren't. They are martyrs. They sacrificed their lives in order to save the Gurudwara. Their mothers are great for giving birth to such brave boys. We are indebted to that mother and that father and that family.. And we shall always stay indebted. And if anyone tries to look at that place with evil intention.. We won't be able to tolerate it. We don't accept it. And these brave boys have once again proven that we still have the courage.. ..to gouge the eyes of those who look at the Gurudwara will evil intentions. We are proud of this army of our Guru. We are proud of them. Khalsa belongs to Lord. Victory belongs to Lord. One question, sir. Like SHO Zorawar Singh just disclosed.. ..Gurtej and Ranjeet weren't traitors. Instead, they sacrificed their lives to save the Gurudwara. If the unfortunate incident had taken place.. ..then it is possible that it could have caused riots between.. ..Hindu, Sikhs and Muslims, all across the country. So these young boys without caring for their lives.. ..stopped this unfortunate incident from taking place. Along with Cameraman Tulsi Mehrat, Diljeet Singh, PTC News, Amritsar. I salute this pious land of Punjab. I salute the brave mothers which gave birth to such brave boys. Thanks to their sacrifice, our community is feeling proud. (Car Brakes Squeaking) The martyrs' bodies have reached the village square. Please pay your last respects to them. My son is here. My son is here. My son is here. My son is here. Sister-in-law.. - My son is here. (Sobbing) Ranjeet? My son! - Why do we have to face such a day? (Crying) Oh God, how did this happen? - Ranjeet! You used to say that you wouldn't give a medal to your father. Now tell me, what will we do without you? Brother! Brother! Get up. Calm down. Hello. Mother, you are great. You are great to give birth to such a brave child. Mother, I pay my respects to you. You left us. Brother! No.. Please forgive me, son. No, don't cry. Don't create an obstacle in his path by crying. Sister, you should feel proud of your brother. He sacrificed his life for his Guru. Good girl. God bless you. Good girl. (Music Playing) "You are going somewhere, from where you shall never return."
