Hello? Yes, Granny. How are you? Fine. And you? Fine. And the farm, how's it going? - Alright. - Hurry, Françoise. - You're late. - Yes, ma'am. Can't talk now. I'll call back. OK. Love you. I'm very sorry. Hello. - How are you feeling? - Much better. - The physio helped. - That's great. Next time, please wait for me to change the lightbulb. That's not all. A free-range chicken and potatoes. My niece and her husband are coming over. Look, I made you a list. And I put in 20 euros, too. Try not to overspend. - Right, now... - Oh no! Mrs. Berthaux, they said no chocolates. What did the doctor say? And who'll be told off? Me. Mrs. Bissainthe, get what's on the list. Period. You're no longer the principal. I'm sick of your insolence! I demand my chocolates! There! 30 euros, please. Thanks. What's this, Miss Le Bris? Yoghurt, ma'am. And where did the yoghurt come from? Probably from the fresh foods department. No. They were in your cupboard. - Do you have the receipt? - No. - They were in the garbage. - You know what that's called? No. It's called theft, and you'll pay for that. But they were in your garbage. So what? OK. Please explain. They had expired. You know the staff is forbidden to touch it. And every night there are people who go through your garbage. Mind your own business, ma'am. But this is my business. I'm a client, right? I have a right to speak. Go express yourself somewhere else. In Africa, for example. Come now, don't use that tone. I might get angry! Here, take your crap stuff! There! So what? - Get lost! Savage! - What? Fat ass! - What did you say? - I said: "Fat ass!" You're crazy! Yes, I said fat ass! Thanks. Thanks a lot. Mrs. Grenet is requested at the front desk. - Savage. - Talking to yourself? That crazy woman made me so mad! Still want extra hours? Why? The Vavasseurs need someone. Good money. I'd need a wad before I'd agree to work for them. Why's that? That Vavasseur woman's a pain. Their last help had a breakdown. It's crazy. The money's great. Hey! Where's my kiss? We'll see after the bonus. Oh, crap! My shopping cart. My cart. My cart. Do you want one? What's your name? Gaspard Carpentier. Not at school today, Gaspard? My teacher is sick. Give me that. Oh, at last! - Hello, Auntie. - Hello, Auntie. So early! Marie-Lou is still out shopping. We got all the essentials. Here, this is for you. Oh, you are so kind. You're lucky to have a cat. What's his name? - Mistouflet. - Nice name. - I love cats. - So do I. But she won't listen. Don't let them get to you. You have to defend yourself. Never lose face. - So what did that get you? - I shut her up. And I've just lost my job. And I rented from her, so now I'm homeless. Well done. That's just great. Can I have one? Where are you off to? That kid is always alone. It's not safe, with all the weirdoes around here. That one seems to be starving. It doesn't take much to end up like that. I may have a job for you. There would be some tidying up, vacuuming, dusting. It's not hard. It will be fine. Careful. We're crossing. As for a room, don't worry, we'll find something. Thanks. Help me! Just get me out of here! Calm down, Mrs. Vavasseur. Breathe deeply. I'll get you out. I'm suffocating! Please get me out of here. My God, I'm going to die! I'm going to die! - Hello. - Hello. - I've had enough. - Patience, Mrs. Vavasseur. - You keep saying that. - What's wrong? The elevator's broken again. I can't stand it. Get me out of here! Help is on the way. I've tried everything. Does Ma Vavasseur still need someone? Right now, she needs to get out of there. I've found a real gem. - Help! - Later. I don't have time. I don't have time either. Open up! I have to go. Don't move, he'll be back. I'm almost there. None too soon. Finally! - Oh, thank you! - Bravo! Are you OK, Bogdany? You didn't sprain anything? Mr. Bogdany, you swore to me this wouldn't happen again. That you'd see the building manager about it. So? See you tonight. - Hello. - Hello. New to the building? Yes. Welcome. Luc Leblond. Pleased to meet you. - Are you OK? - Yes. Sorry I'm late. The elevator was broken. Mrs. Vavasseur was stuck. Luckily Liliane and Serge kindly brought the meal. We left you a bit of salad and some pâté. No thanks. Not hungry. - Auntie. - Could you clear away, Marie-Jo? - My name is Marie-Lou. - I'm sorry. Could you please bring us the fruit basket? Here are the pralines. - She's declining, don't you think? - No. She should be walking sooner than planned. - I meant her head. - What's with her head? Earlier I was talking to her about her brother, I mean, Dad. She forgot when he died. We all forget things sometimes. Your aunt is not so young. Yes, you're right. Here. Take this, I'd like you to have it. You're so nice to her. What would we do without you? It's nothing. I'm just doing my job, Viviane. - It's Liliane. - Sorry, pardon me. A little gift for your daughters. Could you make the coffee, Marie-Jo? My place isn't very big, but if we squeeze in a bit... I was saying: My place isn't very big, but if we squeeze... And that way you'll get to know my daughters. Oh? Yes. Is there anyone home? It's Mom. - You didn't forget the bread again? - Did you say hello? Hello, ma'am. Hello. You'll go get the bread after homework. Your coat. - Hello. - Hello. This is Loulou. My youngest. Hello, Loulou. Have a seat. The sofa is yours. Thanks, girls. - You're welcome. - She forgot the bread. And she even goes right by the bakery. Are there any cakes left? You don't miss the West Indies? Oh, that? It's the beach at Clermont Ferrand. Go on, you've nothing to do. OK, enough. Go to your rooms. I'm fed up. I do everything here. - Stop, no more from you. - Yes, that's right. You don't have kids? You didn't find a father? Once I thought I'd found the right guy, but no. It's best to know beforehand. Yes. And then I left, and here I am. - You like it here? - It's OK. I'm starting to find my way on the metro. It's just a bit stressful. You'll get used to it. - Let me take your suitcase. - Thanks. Make yourself at home. Thank you. The best is yet to come. Let's go. Don't be late on your first day. - Hello, ladies. - Hello. - Know him? - He lives in the building. - Yes, I know. - He takes care of his mom. - He's not bad. - Don't you start. Marie-Lou, I'm a bit nervous. You should be. I'm just joking. Wait. - Hello, Hervé. Is your mother there? - Yes, resting. Hervé, who's that? It's Mr. Bogdany with a lady. Please come in. Thank you. - My name is Françoise. - Hervé. - The housekeeper? - Yes, Mrs. Vavasseur. A real gem. What is your name? Françoise Le Bris. I've never had much luck with Bretons. Stubborn as mules. Not all Englishwomen are redheads. Why do you say that? Do you have any references? Yes. I've got them all at home in my apartment. I've no idea about redheads but you have an important exam in 2 months, no? - Yes, mother. - Well then. - I'll show you the apartment. - Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'll leave you to it. My husband is a stickler about the bathroom being clean. He has a very keen sense of hygiene. We change the sheets every week. Here's the main thing. Be careful with this vase. It is my pride and joy. It comes from my husband's family. And please wear this smock here. I only pay housekeepers cash in hand. - Oh? - Till tomorrow. Wait, I'll help you. Catch. Do you like soccer? Yes. I'd like to be goalkeeper. - I was midfielder. - With the boys? - No. It was a female team. - Only girls? Yes. What do you think? - Do you like manga? - Yes. Did it go all right at the Vavasseurs? Yes. At least I think so. Do you have time for another job? It depends. The boy's mother needs someone to collect him from school and help him do his homework. She works on the other side of Paris. - If it fits with my schedule. - Yes. Since it's not... OK. I can work it out. Why not give Papa Bogdany a kiss to thank him? Don't give in to this disgusting guy. Shaking carpets out in the common areas is forbidden! That's it. We'll tell him, Mr. Bogdany. So? Tell me everything. How was it? - I'll tell you tonight. - OK. Les Fauvettes Residence Liliane and Serge brought me that. The building is brand new and the grounds are lovely. You're not moving into a seniors' home? I have no sons to look after me. But I'm here. That's nice of you, but it's not the same. You'll come and see me there. Starting work at Ma Vavasseur's is no picnic. - Yes, you know her. - That's why I refused. Loulou, finish your soup, or no dessert. You should have warned me. Thanks a lot. It's best to start with the worst. After that, anything will seem easier. Yes. Well, we'll see about that. I won't do this all my life. I want to be a cosmetician. - At least I think so. - And I want to be a great chef. With a big hat. - Ah! - Yes. School tomorrow. Say goodnight to Françoise and go to bed. - Is she staying again? - Her name is Françoise. And yes, she's staying again tonight. - Good night. - Good night. I don't want be a bother. - When you are we'll kick you out. - Oh, OK. I'm kidding. It's been a while. As for him, he always turns up at dinner time. On the pretext of tucking the girls in. - Are the girls in bed? - Yes. - I'm not disturbing you, I hope? - No. We missed you. - Don't we know each other? - No, you don't. Here. Have a seat. Don't just stand there. Here. Eat your soup. That'll stop you talking baloney, as usual. Day before yesterday, didn't we say that would be the last time? Oh really? No. I don't remember that at all. Now you'll remember, there's a witness. Right, Françoise? Now, it's... delicious. - You still have your touch. - True. Don't be afraid to scrub. Then I'll show you for the windows. Yes, ma'am. I made you some coffee. Thank you. - Here. - That's kind of you. - Do you think you'll stay? - Yes. I'm easy-going. - Hervé, are you working? - Yes, mother. That hurts. Not so hard. Perhaps you could use a bit less spray? Oh! It's Bella. Nice she's playing the piano again. She's a great pianist. We were good friends back then. Since her illness she won't see anyone. It's sad. It's Luc playing the violin. She's lucky to have a son sacrifice himself for her. - Good sons are rare. - Yes. Luc is totally devoted to her. When my brother died my niece was 10. And during his illness, as he had already lost his wife, I promised him I'd look after her. - Liliane? - Yes. Serge and her are so nice to me. - There. You look gorgeous. - Thank you, Marie-Lou. Françoise! Where are you, Françoise? I'm finished, ma'am. I'm going. Could you just give the sideboard the once-over? No. My time is up. See you tomorrow. - Got a train to catch? - No. I have to pick up a little boy. - Going shopping? - Yes. Is you mother okay? She finds it more and more difficult to play the piano. - I can clean for you. - You're very kind... You know, she won't see anyone. Hello? Yes, Mother. No, don't worry. I won't be home late. Fine. Get some rest. - Growing old is no fun. - For sure. Excuse me, I have to go. - I got an A in poetry. - Bravo! Tell me your poem? Lili slides the slug Down the classroom window She helps out the boys Who haven't done their homework On the cafeteria wall Lurks Lulu the dormouse He cheers up the little ones Who have no appetite Mistouflet! Here, kitty! Where are you? Mistouflet? Where are you? Mistouflet? Come back, Mistouflet. Mistouflet? Mistouflet. Mistouflet? Mistouflet, come back. I'll leave you. We're off to my sister's. I've made you a list of what to do. Most important, don't open the door to anyone, and be sure to lock up before you leave. - Fine. - Fine? And Mr. Vavasseur? He's at a seminar out of town. He'll only be back Monday night. The taxi is waiting, Mom. Have a nice weekend, Françoise. Have a nice weekend. Don't forget to water the plants. - OK. Bye. - See you Tuesday. Settled in, Mr. Dumontet? Not yet. I'm waiting for some furniture. But the essentials are there. You're a doctor, aren't you? - Not quite. - Will you be seeing clients? Patients, not clients. The condo owners aren't keen on that. - Oh? - Oh, no. You never know who's coming in. - We've had thefts recently. - Thefts? Flowerboxes. A dozen have been stolen in 6 months. - That's bizarre. - Yes. Say, about your clients... Patients. So, your clients. Are they the loony type? Not at all. They're very normal, like you and me. Say, speaking of loonies, I've got a letter for you. Oh, shit! Hello, Françoise. - What's the matter? - A catastrophe. I... - Did you break it? - Yes. It slipped out of my hands. I heard your music, and it broke. Wait, we'll find a solution. - Really? - It was my fault. Thank you, Mr. Bogdany. That's kind. - Hello. - Sir. Hello, Mr. Leblond. Hello, Françoise. - Is that his wife? - No. She does the cleaning. Oh! That's very nice. I may need a cleaning lady too, at my place. - I could set it up for you. - Really? Thank you. Here. Thanks. How much do I owe you? - Nothing. It's a gift. - There's no need. That's true, but it would be my pleasure. How about lunch? I don't take invitations from women. - Really? - On principle. Well, if it's a principle... Françoise is a nice name, but old-fashioned for a young woman. No! It's my grandmother's name. - Really? - Yes. There are a lot of Françoises in Brittany. We call them Soizic. It's short for Françoise. So what should I call you? Well, Françoise. Of course. - Thanks. - Thanks. Isn't it risky to leave your mother alone? No. She always has a long nap in the afternoon. You play the violin well. Yes, it made you break a vase. Well, yes. You don't like Schubert? I know nothing about classical music. What's your profession? I'm in global business. Think skyscrapers, offices and lost hopes. That's a bit sad. I find it hard living far from nature, the countryside. Yes, I can imagine. I miss the sea. You like the sea? Oh yes, very much. You are even prettier when you laugh. Thank you. Thanks again for the vase and for the whole afternoon. You saved my life. Goodnight. What are you doing? Who are you? The cleaning lady. You broke my wife's favorite vase. Jérôme, who is that? Clear all that up. Sorry I scared you earlier. Don't mention it. You see, I was afraid it was Gisèle. - I'm going, Jérôme. - Yeah, right. You understand the situation? Yes, I think so. I'll make you a deal, Françoise: say nothing, and I won't mention the vase. - She'll notice. - No, she won't. Don't worry. If necessary, I'll say I broke it. In any case, it was an ugly bauble. Please don't forget to change the sheets. Have you started smoking again? You quit in 1975. No, no. It's Liliane. - Did she come for lunch? - Yes, yesterday. - We made a decision. - Oh really? Yes. I decided to go into a retirement home and give them my apartment. I've an appointment with the notary. Really? Serge has had no work for 6 months. And their lease expires in a few weeks. - They'd be better here. - Whose idea? Mine. They'll come get me every weekend for lunch. That way I wouldn't have to sell my furniture. It's a good way to help them. I'd rather they were grateful while I'm still alive. OK, fine. That's enough. Back already, Mrs. Vavasseur? Hervé got food poisoning from seafood. That's terrible. A friend died of it in 24 hours. One rotten whelk and that's it. Good thing I had the duck, at any rate. Do something. My wife mustn't find out I'm here. I'll make you a hot drink. - You're already here? - Yes. I got here early. Hervé is sick. Could you make him some herbal tea? Yes. I don't know. Think of something. Give me her number. OK. OK. Your herbal tea, Hervé. Thank you, Françoise. What happened to you? I was at a restaurant and I had... Yes, hello? Hello. I'm from the Parfums des îles beauty products. Are you Mrs. Vavasseur? Yes, speaking. Well, I am pleased to announce that your name has been drawn and we can offer you a great deal. A great deal? Um, well... a great deal of shit. Oh, that's nasty! - What's going on, Marie-Lou? - Nothing. Just laughing. Your sign is a bit crooked. You think so? Yes. Look. This side is higher. I'll straighten it. OK, come in. - Do you like DIY? - Yes, I enjoy it. Back home we had to do everything. I mainly need some ironing. When you work with patients, you have to look presentable. Especially the shirts. I'm a bit obsessed. Alright. May I ask a question? Yes, of course. What's psychoanalysis for? Psychoanalysis... Listen, it... helps people who suffer to feel happier. Or at least less unhappy. You advise them how to live? No. The patient does most of the work. They talk and I listen. I'm an ear. Oh! Oh, shit. Your first client? No. Go on. Shh. That must be stressful. The first time... - Yes, sure. - Shall I open the door? Yes, please. So tell me, how do I look? Super. Good luck. Hello, sir. Please come in. The doctor is waiting. Through here. - Have a good session. - Come in. Have a seat. ...a strange dream. I was in the middle of... someplace, in a square, I had forgotten to put on my pants. And then... Watch the collar. You're crushing it. Can I take a break? - Already? - Yes. Right. Watch. How's Mrs. Berthaux? Poor thing. Her niece wants her in an old folks' home. Everyone isn't like Mr. Leblond is with his mother. - He's not your type. - Why not? I find him rather... rather cute. Ah! Cute, how? At home, we say that when you find one you like... They gave me samples at the salon. - I'll give you a facial. - No. - Yes! - No! Please. Hold this for me. - It smells good. - Doesn't it? What's this? "To lighten black skin." Why not straighten my hair, while you're at it? - Oh, let's! - No. - Please. - No! - Oh, please! - No. One side! The right! The right side! Hey! Can you make less noise? Tomorrow's school. In 10 years, when the trees have grown, it won't be bad. But she won't be there to see it. It's still a little bare. But it will grow. Anyway, if I don't like it, Liliane promised I could come back and live with them. I wouldn't count on it. - What? - Nothing. Just saying don't count your chickens. Don't forget the notary appointment on Friday. No. - We'll need to take a taxi. - Why? Hasn't Liliane got a car? Yes, but she has a very important meeting. Yeah. That must be it. - Hi, Gaspard. - Hi, Marie-Lou. Hello, Gaspard. Here you are. Did you like it? I liked Dragon Ball better, from last week. - Here. This one's good too. - Ah. Thank you, Gaspard. I hope it's not another samurai story, because I'm a bit tired of samurais. No. This one's about an atomic power plant. That's much more fun. Wait, I forgot. I've something for you. Marie-Lou! Can you give him the tickets in the small drawer? Here. What's this? The town has invited seniors to visit the catacombs. To prepare them. Okay, hurry up. You'll be late for school. Bye, Gaspard. Oh, Mom! The butcher had no steak. I got a piece of liver. I know how you hate it. You made me eat it, now it's your turn. You should eat it almost raw, to regain your strength. Liver should be eaten rare. We'll play first, okay? Sit at the piano. I'll join you. Hello, Miss Le Bris. - Hello. - You OK? - Yes, thanks. - Ah! It's you. - Hello. - I'm on the wrong floor. I burned you a CD with photos of my farmhouse. Maybe your mom would like to see nature, since she never goes out. She hates nature, especially animals. - If you knew her... - I'd really like to know her. I'm coming, Mom. I have to help her eat. Another time. Oh, no! This can't be true. Please. Help! Mr. Bogdany! No! For pity's sake! Is anyone there? I'm in the elevator! I'm trapped! - Mother! - This will finish me off, son. I can't understand this. You'll understand it when the owners kick you out. Ok, come on. Let's get you a little air. That elevator is impossible. I'll go crazy with this. I've no idea how to act with men. What is this nonsense? I don't know. I think I scare them. Maybe you're too direct. You need to be more aloof. Flee me, I'll follow, follow me, I'll flee. Oh, yeah? You have to rule with an iron fist. It's Marius. - You know his ring? - It's dinner time. - Dad! - My darlings, how are you? Is school going well? Do I add a setting? He's a freeloader. When I get paid I'll help with rent. It's not that. The bastard just eats so much. Cheers. Weekdays, my husband works late. He needs to rest on weekends. The kids and I respect that. But I have a feeling, how should I put it, he sees me as an object, a thing. Not a person. I do what I have to, to be desirable. I'm not complaining but I wish... Oh no! Bye, Mrs. Thénard. It's been six months since we made love. That can change, Mrs. Thénard. - Are you humoring me? - Not at all. Oh, I forgot. - Here. - Thanks. Until next week. Thanks. I have problems too. What's the matter? Me, too... I've got problems. What's wrong? I've got man problems. Sorry. What kind of problems? I don't know. As if... they don't see me, like I'm not there. Is it the guy on 1 who upset you? Well... Would you like to do a little work on yourself? We could swap for housekeeping hours. You need some help. What you're asking is unethical. Something burning? No, nothing. With all this, I forgot to pay you. Here, Françoise. Thank you. Oh, it's you, Mr. Bogdany. You scared me. Another flowerbox was stolen, so I keep an eye out. You're right. Is your folks' garage empty? There's some junk in it... Why don't they rent it? I know a guy who'd take it. They're keeping it till I get a car. Too bad. Could've made some dough. Good night, sir. Mr. Bogdany. What's going on? Sorry. Didn't see the board. - You'll have woken the girls. - Probably not. Gaspard's mom was late, so I stayed with him. I'm sorry. You could have let us know. This isn't a hotel. Yes, sorry. Sorry. I understand you have a private life. If you understand it, tell me. I certainly don't. And you're part of the family. What's going on with Mrs. Berthaux? I won't see her again if she leaves... And I love that old woman. - That's so sad. - Yeah. And you? How's the family? - Okay, I think. - You never call them? No. But I get news from my grandmother. Are you mad at them? Well, my brothers left... and my dad counted on me to take over the farm. When I said I'd go to Paris... he sulked. He won't see me. He said that in the heat of the moment. Yes. But he thinks I'm back at school. Oh, I see! That's it. Yes, I see. - It's complicated. - Cheers, anyway. - Last week, you refused. - Things have changed since. What's happened? Mrs. Berthaux is going into a home. That's why her niece was showing the flat. What? Showing it to whom? They were to live there. She just asked me to be discreet. She wants the keys Friday. When I realized, it was too late. She just wanted my money. Still, I should have known better. Because I knew her sister first and it was the same thing. Go on, Mr. Pointillard. But I still haven't learned my lesson. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Françoise! Françoise! What are you doing? I'm with a patient. You sink is clogged. It needs to be taken care of. That's my shirt. I've got to tell you about someone who's sick. A neighbor. You scorched it. I tell you about someone who's sick, and you talk about an old shirt. It's my favorite one. - I'm coming! - He's coming! Can I take a leak? No. We don't do that here. We only talk. All right, Mr. Pointillard. Where were we? - Your wife... - No. It was my wife's sister. Yes, your wife's sister. How is she? Help! Oh, no! Help! "One night, Barba Louarn "stayed so late at her spinning wheel "that she fell asleep over her work. "Her distaff fell from her hands, "and the noise woke her up. "She was astonished to see the whole room "glowing with white light, "and on the table, "a freshly-severed head "which was dripping with blood. "She knew it was her son's head, "a sailor on board a State vessel. "The eyes were wide open "and stared at her with great anguish. "Wringing her hands, "she cried out..." Gaspard? Let's hope the elevator works. - I grilled sardines. - The whole place smelled them. Really? Next time, buy canned sardines. Françoise? Do you call this squeaky clean? Don't you use toilet brushes in Brittany? Françoise? Gaspard? Tell me what got into you. - Will you go with me? - Where? Mrs. Berthaux gave them to me. "Catacomb quarries". What are the catacombs? There are skulls and skeletons in the walls. That sounds cool. It'll be scary. It's hard to tell now with the furniture, but it will be nicer when it's done up. Is this a structural wall? - Do you know? - No. But we can find out. We just inherited it. It could use a good makeover. - The price takes that into account. - That's true. When will it be vacant? As soon as possible. We're moving to Nice next month. - How much storage space is there? - There's plenty. Look. There are closets everywhere. Here, there. And an extra-large one, as a bonus. Serge, come back. Ladies. Sir. I'll come back another time. Don't bother. The apartment's not for sale. Goodbye. I swear it wasn't me, Auntie. - Will you forgive me? - We'll see later. Go find your jerk of a husband before he screws up. - A cup of tea? - I'd rather have some port. What's wrong, ma'am? Jérôme is leaving me. After 25 years of marriage. Could you have imagined that, Françoise? What will become of me? I wanted to talk to you. I'm a little pressed for time. You said you don't know much about classical music, so I got two matinee tickets. It's Radu Lupu playing Chopin. That's kind. But I can't tomorrow. I promised Gaspard I would take him to the catacombs. Sorry. They had a nerve, trying to sell my apartment without telling me. Good thing my brother's dead. Their faces when they saw us! I'm a little ashamed of it. You shouldn't be. You're in your own home. You heard the physio, in 8 days, you'll have the walker. There's Bella! Bella! What a surprise! Stop her. I want to talk to her. - Ma'am? - Off to the catacombs. Don't move! Excuse me. Don't worry. I'll bring it back. Where are you going? She's nuts. Bogdany will come and get you! Mrs. Bissainthe, I order you to come back! Sorry. Come on, move! Françoise, I wish there weren't so many people. It must be really good. The tour is starting. If you would please follow me. Kids under 14, must stay with an adult at all times. There are miles of galleries. It would be easy to get lost. Keep coming through. Here we are. Thank you. Come through, please. Their origins date back to the 18th century. I'm a little scared. - About 8 million... - Françoise, stay with me. ...people's bones were moved to the catacombs, some of them are in this site. Don't worry. It's just a short circuit, due to the damp. If you have a flashlight, get it ready. - Glad we brought one. - This way. There's nothing to be afraid of. This way, everybody. Watch this for me. But... That girl is completely crazy. You have to find me another housekeeper. We'll take care of it, ma'am. Bella... I must have been dreaming. Must be losing my marbles. - I smelled smoke on 1. - What a day. It's coming from the Leblonds. Here's the famous saying: "The Empire of the Dead starts here." Duck your head before you enter the tunnel. The ceiling is low. - What? - Gaspard? Gaspard? Françoise? Françoise, where are you guys? He's looking for you! Françoise? Gaspard? You'll get lost! Ma'am? You haven't seen a... Help, Françoise! Gaspard, where are you? - Did you recognize him? - Yes. - Mrs. Leblond? - Tell them. - They'll think I'm crazy. - It's a crazy story. - In the quarry... - They can't hear us. - There must be someone. - You got a key? Of course. Mrs. Leblond? We're sorry to burst in like this. But you know, the smoke... Ma'am? Mrs. Leblond? Come with us, sir. His mother found Luc Leblond did not murder his mother, but he lied about her death and hid her body for months. I told you to be wary of the Mama's boy. "Death was due to natural causes "which the autopsy will no doubt specify. "Given his mental state upon arrest, "he was taken to a psychiatric hospital, "where doctors will try to decipher "his strange personality." Oh, wow! You lost the jackpot. I told you I have no luck with men. Anyway, this boy didn't kill anyone. Loving your mom too much isn't a crime. No. Certainly not. - And hiding the body? - "Hiding the body"! Wait for him at the asylum door. Why not? Sensitive men are rare. He's got a problem. He's not always like that. Perhaps he's simply jealous. Police. We want to see Mr. Vavasseur. He doesn't live here now. What's it about? It's your son we'd like to talk to. Hervé? I don't understand. We have questions for him. - But he's not here. - We'll wait. Could you show us his room? I hope you have a warrant. Oh, my God! It's the stolen flowerboxes. Is this your garage? Yes. These lights are something! This must be what caused the lift to lose power. Does psychoanalysis heal? The black book of psychoanalysis Is someone there? Am I disturbing you? Oh, Françoise! Is there a problem? I don't think so. No, it's okay. - Are you okay? - Yes. The crime money. It was in the Vavasseur kid's room. Why bring it here? I didn't know where else to hide it. And actually... I wondered if it couldn't be used for a party for the residence. So people could get to know each other. That's for sure, yes. Isn't loneliness a terrible disease? Oh, yes. It wouldn't take much for people to get to know each other and enjoy each other's company. - Don't you agree? - Yes, I do. It's nothing. It's a bad connection. - I'll fix it tomorrow. - OK. Francis, I wanted to tell you that... You were right about Leblond. You and Gaspard both got lucky. Yes. Poor Gaspard. What a fright he had seeing the mummy. Why didn't he say anything? That's very common with kids after a trauma. - Luc wasn't a bad person. - No, he wasn't bad. Totally twisted, but not bad. No more than the patients who lie on your couch. - They say some strange things! - You listen? Oh, no. I don't listen. But I was right outside... And you should be firmer with Mrs. Thénard. - A little kick... - This is my field. - It's a gift from my godmother. - It suits you. - Do you find me ridiculous? - No! But Francis, I admit that psychoanalysis... So why did you ask for consultations? Well, I don't know. Maybe because... I'm at ease with you. It's not very eth... Eth... How do you say it? - Ethical. - Yes. It's not ethical. See you tomorrow, Francis. Bye, Françoise. Then blue, red. Yes, that's good. - Is it okay? - It's fine. I found tenants for the Leblond apartment. Do they need a cleaning lady? I have no idea. Anyway... they seem a little odd. They can't be worse than the last ones. They're moving in today. Hello, Mrs. Vavasseur. Will you join us later? Yes, with pleasure. See you later. Very classy, Françoise. Her husband left her, her son nearly got jailed. It would be mean to drop her. Like her vase. Here's the music. Hello, everyone. - Hello. - Can you please help? I tried to bake a chocolate cake. That explains the chocolate all over the kitchen. Otherwise, what's for dessert? Ah! Here are the new tenants. With that menagerie, they'll need a cleaner. Wait, I'll give you a hand. - Françoise? - Yes? I wanted to thank you... for the other day. Isn't it a nice party? Yeah. You wouldn't have some of that money left over? Don't push it, Hervé. Of course. Oh my! My feet are killing me. - Did Bogdany step on them? - Oh, no. He's like a pro. Think again. I'd say that tonight, he's even got a certain charm. - Really? - Yes. - Charming? - Yes. Are you drunk? My poor girl, you're clueless. - I did well to keep some. - Absolutely. At least we know where this comes from. Well, not many neighbors came. They didn't want to make friends. Their loss. That's right. Isn't that the lady from the ground floor? Call for help. - I am an ear. - Oh! OK. Well, we'll see... Go. I need to go to the bathroom. - So? - Take a look at yourself. Anyhow, it's between her and... I don't remember. Subtitles: Eclair Group
