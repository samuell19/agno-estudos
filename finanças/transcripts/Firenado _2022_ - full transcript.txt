Reports are coming in across the county of a tornado which according to eyewitnesses has caught fire. The so-called firenado has left a wake of destruction in its path. We are reporting to you from NBT News and enroute to the location now. We're coming up to firenado now. The heat, wait, pull up, pull up. And now onto the weather, strong winds are expected today particularly in Houston, Texas. Tornado Warning is currently in place for EF1 rating. Winds up to 100 miles an hour in the worst hit areas across Victoria and Austin. People are advised not to travel and to stay indoors. There's likely to be falling trees and damage to some buildings. But now on to the weather. Tornado warning currently in place for EF1 rating with up to 100 miles an hour-- Mr. Moore? Yes. I have a parcel for you. I need your signature, please. Couldn't you have left it with security? Well, I need your signature so I can't just hand the parcel to anyone. I need you to personally sign for it. Very well. Is that all? Yeah, that's it. Thank you. Arth, where is he? Arth, in future if you can let someone through my main gate to my front door, sure to give me some warning. I can't have people just strolling in here. I pay you a lot of money to be my set of eyes and ears. Ain't a lot of point me paying you if you ain't going to do your job. Sorry, boss. It's OK. Just be more vigilant next time. If we get any more deliveries, you let me know, I'll come to the gate. Understood. Thank you. Let me take this. You're late, Anna. I know. I'm sorry. My alarm didn't go off. It's so early. Oh, don't worry. I'll try and make up the time on the road. We have to be at Lawton's field in under an hour. Actually, Deborah knows. I was hoping maybe we could talk. Haven't got time now, Anna. Can it wait until tomorrow? After all we're on the verge of a momentous breakthrough and tomorrow will be a glorious day. Anus. Hi, Anna. Hey. Hey, Helena, cappuccino me. Oh, yeah. Help me hold that, thanks. There we go. Wow, Greg, doesn't that burn? Well, yeah, yeah. Totally burns but I need the keg. Helena, chuck that out of the window for me. Whoa, Greg. I'm no having the planet ruined any more than it already is. You seem quite, Anna. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Must be the nerves. This greatest scientific breakthrough of the decade. Is there something on your mind, Greg? No, just super excited, man. How is your drone? Hey, we talked about this man. This is not a drone, this is a tornado infiltration unit. Don't get it twisted. No, that's funny because it looks exactly like my 12-year-old cousin's drone. OK, Anna, fine. Yes, it's mounted on a drone, okay, but how else am I going to get it up there, put it on a kite? Whoa. Ben Franklin much. Easy, Greg. The coffee is kicking in. No, I'm just trying to work. Some of us actually work around here. You should be happy, Anna, this is your first outing. Well, I didn't do much. Well, everyone plays their part, you remember that. Yeah, yeah. I thought I'd be doing more. Your time will come. Next project you'll be there from the start, you'll get more responsibility, you just joined in a busy time. Lawton's app, we're here. Havarti, everyone. Havarti. Come on off. Havarti, Greg, Havarti. Running all the way. The experiment will commence at 10:00 AM. Helena, give me a read. Traveling 70 miles per hour in the center for us at 500 meters. That's 60 miles per hour heading North Easterly and arching slightly 10 degrees. Which means? It's coming this way. Are we going to be OK here? Oh, yes, it's perfect. When it gets up to 200 yards we'll launch the device. Greg are you ready? Is the drone ready? Tornado infiltration unit. Well. She'll fly captain. Oh, captain. Yes, I like it. OK, everybody let's get ready. Helena I want you to track the course, make sure it doesn't deviate. Oh, and Anna, take notes, record for posterity. Yes, captain. 400 meters. OK, boys and girls, it looks like we've got ourselves a rope tornado here. You know why they call it a rope, Anna? Why is that, Devlin? Because it's all like a rope. God himself could shimmy down this one. 300 meters. Devlin, this thing looks like it's moving at a pace, man. I suggest we move our asses, get this thing in there, so we can get the hell out of the way. OK. Take to the skies Greg my boy. All right. All right. Come on. Fly for me baby, fly. Get in course then activate it. Now, Anna, film something for me. Filming in landscape, Anna. I want cinematography here. Drop. Recording. Good day, everybody. Time here is approaching 10:00 AM, welcome to our extreme weather experiment. The device that we're about to launch into this tornado which is currently registering at an EF1 level uses electromagnetic pulses and emits chemical adjusters that can shift the balance of warm and cold air and form malleable pockets. You want to try one in English for our less scientific viewers to understand, boss. Which means we can enhance the energy building inside this thing and we can manipulate. In theory we can make it bigger and there's also another possibility. It's close. Hey, doc, we're going to have to get this thing in there soon, man, I'm having trouble holding it in position. It needs to go right in the middle of the twister right now. Right, It's arcing now, you need to hit it side on, OK, it'll penetrate better. That's what she said. Oh, well, Greg focus. Bad joke. OK, let's move. Come on. Hey, guys, no closer. OK, yeah. This is as far as we go. Uh uh, I've got to get close, I got to make sure this gets in OK Be careful Greg and be prepared to run. I'm going to punch it in. Get in there bitch. Yeah. Great shot, now activate it. Oh, my god, we're active. Calibrating the formation and the gas composition. I'm reading speed, size, and velocity. Hey I'm activating the chemical and electrical pulses, the particles expanding. The rope formation is spiraling faster and amalgamate even more gases. What does that mean? It means the son of a bitch is getting bigger. It had to be wise. Did you ever doubt it? Oh, with in church. Not for a second. This is great. I'm going to intensify it. No, Greg, no. What? Devlin, it works tell him to shut it down. Oh, man, this is beautiful. Whoa. Oh, my god. It's all turning shape, it's intensifying rapidly. She's right. It's a cone formation. We're officially category grade. Devlin! Devlin! OK, yeah, Greg, shut it down, that's enough. I can make it bigger, we could go further. We've worked too hard for too long, man. Let's go further. Shut it down, Greg, it's dangerous. I got control of it. Yeah, I think actually I can push it away by altering the magnetic balance. Come on. Don't get so close. Greg, stop. Stop. Currently 4, Greg shut it down. Fine, just give me a minute. It's not responding. Charging against, increasing in size. What? It's exploding and moving. It's going to head to us. When? About 30 seconds. We got to run. Greg, it doesn't mean anything. In 30 seconds, we need to run. I can't do it, I can't do it. Come on, Greg, come on. You can make it. Fuck, I can do it, I can't do it. Come on, Greg. Anna, just go ahead and take deep breaths. Cause he's fucking dead. He's gone. Jesus. Oh, god. All right, where's it heading? It's on a trajectory east heading out to the coast. But I can see an inward arc beginning to fall. Do you think it might head inland again? I don't know. We need to beat it. No, no, no, no. There's got to be a way to stop it, right? Why couldn't he have just listened? Why didn't we-- we tried to tell him to stop. We tried to warn him. Maybe we shouldn't have played God in the first place. No. We mustn't forget the reasons for doing this. Greg wanted it too. No, we can still fix this. We can still make this right. Helen. What? Keep track of the speed and the course. I'm going to try and get ahead of it. Come on, you rusty piece of shit. Come in. Come on. Relax. Yes, boss? Yes, Thomas. Well, I've noticed we've had some inclement weather today. Yeah, it's a bit windy. A bit windy. OK. What is that? Weather coverage up to date. And this here, in the middle of the screen, passing across the west of the country is a force four tornado. Force four, is that a lot? Christ, Thomas, no. Out of 5. And it's increasing intensity too. This is already the most powerful tornado to hit these shores. It's missing all the major cities thankfully. I don't understand. What's this got to do with us? Around this area here is a country house currently being rented by one Pierce Moore. Never heard of him. Well, you wouldn't have. He's an accountant. But he works for Tony Markwell. Oh, I've heard of him. Moore's got pretty simple Joe Brady. He takes in launder money in big stashes and oversees it until he's curried on to deals, et cetera. There's money awaiting, boys. And then there's small security team and an accountant protecting him. So this guy must get robbed all the time. Would you rob anything from Markwell? Well, no, but-- Technically, but we have a window here, boys. This tornado is going to pass close to his place in about two hours. We can get there in 90 minutes, by which time if he's got any sense, him and his security team would have evacuated to the nearest town or bowled themselves in the basement, if there is one. You want to rip him off? That can be anywhere between a quarter and 3/4 of a million in stash there. And that's just one stash he has too. So how many guards do they have? At least two. Maybe more. What about the security system? That's the beauty of it. We can cut communication and power to the whole area. And they'll just put it down to the twister. We get in. And we get out. And we will have what is known in the traders, plausible deniability. Are you boys game? I'm in. I'm not sure, boss. That was a rhetorical question, Tommy. You come in now. Tool up, you slugs. We're going treasure hunting. Come on, fuck off. I think I've made a breakthrough. OK. What have you got? Right. OK. Just take the next left. And then we need to get within 500 meters of the tornado. Is that even safe? Oh, yeah, don't worry. I'm on it. We'll be safe to about 400 yards. But that is until it intensifies again. OK. So what do we do? Well, I'll have made some adjustments. And I think I can hone in on the TIU's directional system. You can retrieve it? Of course. Well done, Helena. No, we don't retrieve it now but we can use it. How? I use steering wheel. You can drive that thing? In a manner of speaking, we can slowly pull the off-back and still be going inland. Hopefully, she'll go out to sea. Great, great. Let's do that. There's a problem. Well, the trajectory you set it on, it's going to take it straight through several houses. Well, they were close. Surely they would have evacuated. Not necessarily. If this thing goes straight over a country house, it'll destroy it in a moment. If the power intensifies, it'll strip out a basement. Well, then we get ahead of this thing, and we warn them. OK. Let's do this. Oh, shit. Give it a heads-up next time, Doc. Yeah, sorry. It's all right. All right. We got to go back on track. I see it. OK. 500 yards. You got a signal? M-hm. No, I don't have no signal. It's getting closer. It's 470 now. One more sec. What exactly is our safety cut-off here? 300 yards to be exact. 400 meters away. Got it. Whoa. What you you think to? Oh, it's not me. Transmit the new coordinates now. Shit, pulling us. Oh. Careful, careful. We can't lose signal now. Isn't it there yet? Hold it still. But why does It always get stuck on 99? I've never said, OK, go, go go go, go, go. I know, yeah. Before we see some serious shit. Devlin! Shit. What, did it work? It worked. New course set. Good. We need to warn people. Think we're going to have to keep a quick pace to make it. Then we keep it. This is our responsibility. OK. One of the first house coordinates. Latitude, 89. Just give me a zip code, Anna. Sorry, it's 87738. OK. We're going to have to get ahead of this silly game. What speed's it doing? It's fluctuating. Not always moving in a straight line, but it's currently at 55 miles per hour. Are you ready? What on earth are you doing? You know there are weather warnings in place, don't you? Yes, we know. That's why we're here. I boarded my pantry. Daughter and I are going to shut ourselves in soon. No, no, no. No, it won't be enough. Says who? Says me. I'm a meteorologist. We have four minutes. You are right in the path of a force four tornado. I've had stronger farts, love. I'll be fine. What's going on? Hey. Hey, kid, you got to get your dad to listen to us. He's not seeing any sense. We'll be safe here. This house has stood for a century. This house is going to be pulled apart by 170 miles per hour winds. Do you not understand? There was a tornado hitting over all of these. And it's going to chew this place up and spit it out. Listen, you would need to head west towards Jefferson. The tornado is going east. Dad, listen. We need to leave. License or not, I will drive out with you even if you don't want. This is utter nonsense. Anna, Helena, it's time to leave. Hey, does that look like nonsense to you? Billie, you need to get in the car right now. Come on. Come on, man, what are you doing? Anna, they've been warned. We have to go. Seriously? Is everyone all right? There's no one left inside? Jesus. Thank you for warning us. So sorry about the house. Helena, come on. Damn. What's wrong? I've been trying to figure out a way that we can reverse these effects. You think there might be a way? If there is, I can't find it. Greg's control unit had a fail-safe. The system registered to him as initiating it, but clearly it failed. The fail-safe failed. But that's just perfect. I've always been in control. And we study every exercise. How can I let this happen? We all let it happen. Einstein would turn in his grave if he could see my work. Doc, the twister's headed straight on a trajectory from the first house to the second, right? Pretty much. Through the woodland? Yeah. I know I'm going to regret this, but why do you ask? On the far side of Raslow's Wood, there's a gas station. Looks like our twister is headed straight through it. Should we be worried? If the pass is closed, straight over I guess it could-- Could what? You don't want to know. Ooh, do we have time to warn people? called. It's just a few miles up ahead. Thank God. The gas station should be up here on the right. No sign of the twister. It's been slowing. It should be here. Devlin? What? Dev, you play the bad man. We'll see you on the other side. Oh, OK. Is there anyone in there? Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, you. You need to go. There's a twister. It's coming over all of this. There's a twister. It's too dangerous. You got to get out of here. Is there anyone in the back? Don't know. No, go. I said go. Get out of here. Hey, you need to leave. You need to leave now, Helena. Hey. Helena! Yeah. Is it all clear? Clear. OK. Where's Devlin? So what exactly could happen here, Doc? Wait, we'll see. I couldn't get it. The gas compounds from the machine. That depends. Oh. Maybe not. Christ. I better go and check on the readings. OK. We better move. It's picked up speed after igniting. That is bigger. The intensity is increased. Jesus. I thought they were really meant to last a couple of minutes? Well, they do usually. But there was one in Australia that lasted for 40. Jesus. Yeah, I know. We're already up to a category five. How far to the second house? It's 10 minutes. Where's the twister now? Running parallel to us, 55 miles per hour. But we've got the short angle to the second house so we should be able to get ahead of it. When we do arrive? Four minutes. When will the twister hit? Six minutes. Oh, shit. That's not enough time. OK. There's a dirt track up ahead 50 yards to the right. I'm going to take it. What? We'll cut through the fields near the house. This isn't exactly all-terrain, Doc. Can your suspension handle that? Mine can't. The vehicle's may though. Jesus, we should have bought a Jeep. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. No, no. It's OK. We'll make it good time. Winds picking up. You get everything you need? I'm getting from this place now. Bring it straight down the basement. OK. Hello? What's going on? You need to leave now. Leave? That's a tornado nearby. We're going downstairs to the basement. Sir, listen, you don't understand. It is heading right through you. What is it? They say that we need to leave. The tornado is going to come right through the house. Well, we can't leave. We need to stay put. It is a force five tornado. Your house isn't going to survive it. Force five? Absolute rubbish. Not just force five. It's on fire too. I'm begging, if you don't leave now, you're going to die. OK. We told them. Come on, we have to go. No, no, no. I'm not leaving until it goes. It's OK. We're going to go. Come on, Dad, we need to move. You've got two minutes. Think I can help you? No, we haven't got time. We've got to get to the other house as well. He's right. We've got to go. Be quick, please. Be quick. Yeah. Dad, Dad, hurry up! Wait. Why are they leaving? Dad! Dad, oh my god! Oh my god, no! Come on! Move! Dad, Dad, Dad! Dad! Aah! Come on, get in the van. What have we done? Hey, hey, you OK? Don't touch me. You did this! You started this! No, don't do this. We'll save the next one, I promise. What? Here. OK. Signal blocker is activated. I am so ready for this. Whoo! You're a fucking idiot. You're not exactly subtle, are you, Thomas? Look, I've been checking the news, and this tornado's caught fire. It's heading our way. A fire tornado? That's sick. What? Oh, we're going to have enough time to get in and out. Don't start fretting. We'll get in, get the money and leave. We can't be sure this thing will be anywhere near us. Weather forecasters are just guessing where it'll go. And if ever you were thinking of backing out on me now, I'll shoot you me fucking self. Well, come on. Let's gear up. Hey, how's night going? It's slow tonight. I'm going to get some coffee. Do you want one? Yeah, thank you. Thank you. You're all right? I think so. What the fuck? Hello, is anybody there? Boys. What's going on? I don't know. Hands up. Step away from the box, asshole. What the fuck are you doing? We're just changing the electricity, buddy. Hello, buddies, be vigilant. I can't get a signal on my phone. Come in, anyone hear me? You're welcome. Fuck ya. I'm scared. It's all right. I'm sure it's nothing. Two of them. What's this about? Why are you here? Take a wild guess. It's left some fires in its path. But so far, it doesn't look like anyone else died. OK. Nearly there. I'll ask again. Where's the fucking money? I'll tell you again, I don't know what you're talking about. There is no money. We know you're an accountant, Moore. And we know who you work for. I run an office in Draunston. It's a small practice. I told you, you got the wrong man. I'll kill her. I will fucking kill her. I'll fucking kill her. We don't need to do that. We're doing all right for such a humble businessman, ain't ya? What's this one worth? One? 1.2 million? I've got rich parents. What are you looking at? Shit. Wake up, you ass wipe. Boss, we haven't got time for this. Shut it, you tart. Just go on searching. Now! Tear this place apart. You, bring the cars in and check upstairs. We'll take it downstairs. Tommy! Yes, boss. You know, the more I look back, the more I think we could have used a smaller magnetic pull on the device. Lowered the hydrogen levels. So if we do this again, I'm sure we can keep one under control at a smaller scale anyway. Again? Again? Great things can be done with this technology. Yes, and in the wrong hands, terrible things. Just leave it, Devlin. All right. Just leave it. We're here. Just pull over. I wonder if there's anybody still here. Maybe they evacuated already. No, look, there's three cars. Wait here. I'm going to check. You better be quick. We've got five minutes. Lovely. Come on, come on. Look. Fuck! Where is it? Fuck! It's not fucking here! Oh! Hey. Hey. Hey, come on, wake up. Look at me. Hey. Hey. Who the hell are you? It doesn't matter. There's two guys downstairs. Lady, there's three of them. What do they want? Money. Over there on the table, there's some scissors. Just cut it off. OK. Shit. Hurry. Yeah. They will come in back any minute. Get a knife from the kitchen. Boss, it's Moore. He's escaped some girl. And he's armed. Well, so are you. Get after the bastard now. There's another thing. The twister, it's getting close. It's coming. So? We'll burn. Then we'll burn. Move! Ahhhh! Come on. How is it? Where is she? Fucking. I'll fucking kill him. I'll fucking kill him. you bastard. Tommy! Oh! Oh. Hello, you. Where's my fucking money? I fucking told you, there is no money. Where is my fucking-- who the fuck are you? I'm not anyone. Give me the fucking money or I'm going to blow your fucking head off. What you doing? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. My god, let's go. Come on, pick up. Boss? Oh. Oh. I'm here. Are you OK? Get in. Fuck is going on here? Fuck. Where, were you? Does it fucking matter? Get in the car. Hey. Hey, it's me. We're headed to a safe place by the sea. It's northeast. I'll send you the location now. Yeah. Just make sure you're not tailed. OK. Yeah. OK. Northeast, I got it. Northeast. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, god. What the fuck is happening? Fucking way, get out of the way asshole! Fucking guns! Oh, god. I never thought I'd get to see the day when I said this, it's time to engage the hyperdrive. Whoa. Why didn't you tell me we had that? Oh, it's a one-way ride. Should follow them? No, we want the money. We go after Moore. Who the hell are those guys? Why are they shooting at us? Just keep your head down. Where exactly are we going? I've got a place by the sea. It should be safe there. OK. And where is this in my life? What's happening? Oh, baby, what have I done to you? I think the hyperdrive might have killed her. On the upside, I think we lost them. I guess we're going to be all right. Well, thank God for that. What are we going to do about Anna? I guess we go on on foot. You've got to be kidding me. I've got the controller. You grab the tablet. Tell me my eyes are deceiving me. I can explain. I think it's pretty self-explanatory. I mean, what are we now, fucking mercenaries? We were developing weaponry. No, it's not that. Well, how can you be so sure? How do you know what Skylab was going to do with it when we were seeing what it could do even with good intent? I just thought-- I-- I just thought-- We trusted you, Devlin. What are you going to do, take the money and run? No, I would have split it equally. Yeah, but I wouldn't have taken it. I know. That's why I didn't sign. I'm sorry. It was a moment of weakness. They came to me with the offer. I didn't accept it. I'll never trust you again, Devlin. Anyway, we've got more pressing matters. Oh, my gosh. They're gaining on us. Take this. Make it count. What do you mean, make it count? It seems you got the noose, have you? Yeah. Aim for the tires. I don't know how to shoot. Come on. Pull the trigger. You scared them. Fucking shit, fuck. Fuck, why did this happen? You're getting in the fucking way. You're not going to do anything. I'm going to fix it. Yeah? You better because I'm getting your fucking money. I said I can fix this. Fucking fix it. Fucking god. No! Fuck! We lost them. Why is that word exciting? Helena, wait. No, wait up. We've got a big problem. What? Their location is northeast, right? And? Guess what's heading that way. What? Can't be. That's north of the original projection. It's changed its course. It's going straight for them. Oh, god. Hey. You don't look so good. Try to stay awake, yeah? I'll try. But I don't feel so good, it's all. I'm Pierce, by the way. I'm Anna. Nice to meet you. So not bad for a first date, huh? Yeah. Gunfights, outrunning tornadoes. I think I've had better for six, to be honest. Why were they after you anyway? It's complicated. Yeah. But they were looking for something? Money. What, you got a bank vault under your house? It's funny you should say that. It's not too far off. I'll be completely honest with you, Anna. I'm in some deep shit with some bad people. And I'm going to count them with a very select clientele, let's say. And I'm holding on to its welded money. So not legal, but I'm going to do good. It's far from legal. Thing is, now that I've done a few jobs for them, I'm under their thumb. And can't get out. Just don't know what to do. Anyway, look, enough about me. Tell me about yourself. Me? I'm nobody. Nobody? Come on, man. Don't be crazy. You just saved my life. You're pretty amazing. Well, me and my colleagues, we were tracking the twister. Tracking it? What you mean, like meteorologists or venture seekers? I studied meteorology. I took an internship with Dr. Devlin. He's pretty renowned in his field but kind of a black sheep. Black sheep? How Oh, he's a crackpot with wild ideas, at least that's what people say. What do you say? I say, he's a crackpot with wild ideas. But he's a good man. So how did your get on into all this? Do you enjoy it? Actually, I... thought I was going to quit today Quit, why? Uh... Devlin has his quirks, um... I respect him a lot. And he's always been kind to me. But he's so focused on his own work that I feel like I'm not learning anything. I get to get the coffee. Well, glad you didn't quit today. But it sounds like he's not all he's cracked up to be. Yeah. I did get offered another position with a rival in the field. Is that good? You're going to take it? I don't know. I really don't feel so good. Pierce? Hey. Are you OK? Moore! Fuck! Get in the car. We're going to get a fuck away from this twister. What? What about Nate? What the fuck are you looking at Tommy? What about fucking Nate? Fuck that. He's on his own. Fuck. Are you OK? Yeah. I think so. Better thanks to you. So this place yours or another perk of the job? It's mine. But it's a perk of an inheritance. I don't like to speak about it much, but not got many too many fond memories of this place. A lot of traumatic shit happens here. Yeah, I get that. My, um-- my folks are gone too. Not exactly the warmest people. But I still feel guilty. Guilty? How so? Not being more upset when they died I guess. I actually feel worse about betraying Devlin. That wasn't a betrayal, Anna. And feels like it sometimes. He's not exactly a father figure but it's kind of like a crazy uncle or something. So it feels like family though. Yeah, I get that. It's strange I kind of feel a strange connection between us. It must be the adrenaline. Maybe. Escaping danger, it's kind of a rush. And you, do you think we're safe now? I hope so. I don't see how they could ever find this place. Just try to relax and wait for the others to arrive. We're here. And there's the car. Anna. Anna. She's in here. They made it. Got you, Anna. We were being shot at. Who were those people? What did they want? It's all right. It's a long story. I'm sorry. You are? I'm Pierce. Look, I'm really sorry-- Perhaps we could hold off on the introductions. We have to leave. The twister's imminent. It's coming here? Yeah. Oh, my god. Are you going to be OK to drive? I should be. Oh, great. And when we're clear, and the twisters subsided at sea, we can track and retrace the units. Devlin, can you just stop? All right? Anna, we need to go. No, no. Helena listen to me. Are you OK? Yeah, thanks. Please, just listen to me. We need to retrieve it. Why on earth when we just let it sink to the bottom of the ocean floor? You forget it was designed to float. Yeah. And then what good would it be? Maybe we can still perfect the technology. If we know how to increase the mass and velocity of a tornado, maybe we could even subdue one. It could avert a lot of destruction. This is not just me, Helena. We all have a choice. We can retrieve it. Destroy the prototype, erase all of our research so no one else can recreate it. Or we perfect it and keep control. So what's your decision? I haven't made it yet. Well, you know my stance. Oh! God. Lord. Who the fuck are you? They split up. You go right. If we don't get you, the tornado will. You're a long way from home, Dorothy. And Ruby's slippers aren't going to save you now. Come, come get you up. Ladies and gentlemen, people of all ages, today we're going to play a game. Here we have two doors. Behind one, the grand prize. Round and round and round, I go. Where we stop, nobody knows. Door number one, nothing to see. Door number two, who will it be? Where are you? One more door. Let's have some fun. Time's up. Mother fucker. I told you, I don't know where your money is. Anna. That's enough. Where's Anna? Shh. She's safe. Hey, it's OK. Sshhh. You stay back. Listen to me, Devlin. I said, go. And you didn't mean any of it. There, there. All will be OK. I won't let you down. Oh, don't cry. I'm sorry. Don't cry, Helena. But look-- I need to go. We all have to go. Now, I know you're his girlfriend or something. So you must know where my money is. Tell me where it is, and I'll let you walk out of here. Gotcha. Fuck is she? Anna, where are you? Are you OK? He's heading around this way. We got to go. Let's go. Come on. Here, guys, it's clear. We can-- oh. Anna. It's OK. It's OK. Take the other side please. OK. Fuck! Oh, been trying to get out of here fast. Come on, come on. So you think he'll be OK? I really don't know. I hope so. You're going to be OK? Yeah, I'll be fine. OK. Well, what better way for the around here. Thanks. Anna. Where's Anna? Here, we'll be here, Doc. You did well today. Sorry. Don't try and talk. Just hold on. You wanted to talk to me about something this morning. It's not important now. OK, Anna. I know. My old friend, Malco, told me you'd applied. I thought you were rivals. Friendly rivalry. Don't worry, I gave you a glowing reference. I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry. I should have been more attentive. But I promise you, I am very, very proud. Do something for me? Yeah, anything. Destroy everything, every trace of this damn create. Every trace. Help me sit up, would you? I want to watch this. It is beautiful.
