- Hey. - What's up? Check this out. That's the cutest thing ever. Baby's first photo shoot. We are having a baby. - One for you... - Yeah? ...one for me and one for baby I. I love this. We've been trying to have a baby for 5 years, and it's been a long and bumpy road. But here we are, and we couldn't be more excited. I'm going to show you a house. The thought of starting a large project right now seems clinical. It's 100 years old, historic district, right down the street. You're going to love it. Bring your hat. - I need it? - Yeah, you're going to need that. - Is it that bad? No, it's that good. I hate surprises. So here's what's unique about Galveston, Texas. Look at this. This has gotta be at least 11-foot ceilings? Like a giant's house. It's an island that's literally trapped in time. Aah! Look at all the rat poop! All right. Let's not stir that up. Found a hole. All of these homes, they have character. They have the nice trimwork. They have the gingerbread detail on the outsides, you know. They all had their own story. But they are tearing down houses all over town, and it's sad. We're completely obsessed with finding these diamonds in the rough. I'm taking Ashley to look at a beautiful home in one of Galveston's sought-after historic districts. Houses in this neighborhood were built in the late 1800s and are some of the most unique properties on the island, which attract high-end buyers. So if Ashley is willing to take on this project, we could turn a substantial profit. This beauty. Please tell me we are going to see this house. Right? Like, you couldn't have guessed it. Boom. How about that? - So neat! - I know. I've always loved this house. We've been looking at this house since 2011 when we started dating. This is, like, the first house we were ever going to come to, the first house we ever wanted to buy. Which is pretty cool that we're here now and it's on the market. I mean, it's been vacant longer than I can remember. How big is this house? Two bed, two bath, 2,050 square feet. This would be one of the biggest houses we've ever done. Like, are you prepared for this right now? Yeah. In two months, we're going to have a baby. That's a really quick time frame to finish this thing. I agree, but I think we can do it. And I think we should. The biggest drawback for this house is the size. It's big. It's a lot going on right now. We're planning for a baby, finishing our house. It's a lot. You know, I could not imagine doing this house right now. It's got two doors. It was at some point an old duplex. We don't want to renovate a duplex. I agree. So that would definitely be something we would need to get rid of. I mean, this was a traditional Victorian home, but right now, I mean, I don't know what it is. I mean, it has no detail really, and the brick columns that we have here, they're not original. Look at the porch. I mean, there's like a line across it where it looks like the whole thing is about to fall down. And the upper porch, I mean, we're not even going to be able to go out on that. The outside is not selling this house. So to make this Victorian really feel like itself again, I think the biggest thing we need to do is get this aluminum siding off to reveal the original wood siding. You know, fingers crossed it's in good shape. But it is in the historic district, and there are so many beautiful houses around here. This is like one of the last ones that really needs some love on this block. - How much is this thing? - 154,000. That is a lot of money for a house that needs a lot of work. So no doorknob. Door number two? There's a hole. - Is there a back... What are the chances you think you could fit through that? I think you just go through like a little baby. You go through head first. Figure it out. I got it. Yeah. How about that? M'lady. You may enter. - Wow. None of this would be original to, like, an 1890s home. At some point along the way, this house had a remodel. It's definitely newer, like, craftsman-ish maybe. I mean, these are good. - They're awesome. - And look. There's actually a pocket door track, and the floors are nice. - I know. - And I mean, look it. They're oak. Let's continue the tour. Look at this built-in. How awesome is this? I like the little glass handles. I mean, it's got all the drawers. Look, they work too, but these are working. So you could keep this. Look, you can see, like, the stairs through the wall. So you'd have to open this back up to expose the staircase, which would also make this feel like a much bigger open space. I mean, just go for it, right? That's my philosophy. Are we in? We're not in yet. I need to see a kitchen. I need to see some bedrooms, bathrooms, like... There's got to be all those things here. Come on, let's check it out. Look at this, full bath. A full bath downstairs is never a positive thing. Needs to be a half bath but... - But it's a perfect layout. - ...it's a good space. - Right? And look at this. Here's your kitchen. Is this a kitchen? Yeah, it's a kitchen. We've got cabinets. You got a sink. I mean, the main problem is here, we're not connected to the dining room. So people need to walk in and be wowed. They need to forget about the fact that it's not open concept, which is such a big deal to buyers these days. - But that's okay. - This does not have a lot of space. - But that's okay. I guess one positive thing, if you want to give any positives about this kitchen is it does bump into that bathroom, and the tub was on the left. So you could maybe get some of this space for the kitchen. How about that front door? I mean, they always... - It's not a front door. It is currently a back door. It was a single-family home originally, and we still have the door. Absolutely. Well, that's really cool. You know, we've worked on houses from the 1880s, early 1890s, and they all had this arch door. I mean, it was just, you know, a common style. - This space has potential. - Newel post. Wow, that's really nice. Right? And you're going to see it from the entrance, just right down the hallway. I mean, this is what you're going to see. It's awesome. We're missing a lot of spindles, like, the whole way. Well, you know. - All right. - There's ways to fix that. So here's the upstairs kitchen for the duplex. Completely unnecessary. This being a kitchen, if we turned it into a bedroom, that means we've just gained a bedroom... Which is good. ...because they're calling it two bedrooms. So third right here, and that's good for sale value. Let's go keep looking. Look at how beautiful this master is. Wow. Imagine if we could, like, leave the beams exposed in the ceiling just for some extra design in the room. So I'm thinking we could throw some plywood up there, expose them and still have a ceiling. Look at this closet. It's like a different time when they needed to hold like one fancy dress, and it was just all about status, you know? Right. - Now it's like... - I got a closet. - ...my home has closets. - I know. Which would've meant that they had some money because, you know, back then you would've paid taxes on the doors so it was like a luxury to have a closet. So taxing in the late 1800s was based off the number of doors you had in your house, so one way around that is people would install these large walk-through windows leading out onto porches. And that's what we've got two of here. You've got this balcony but really no way to get out there other than the walk-through windows. Well, that's what we're going to be left with in the historic district, and that's what we'd be left with anywhere. Yeah. We're not ever putting a door out here. All right. See what else we can see. This is a big place. It really is. One thing everybody wants in their home is an attached master bath, which is what we need to figure out. But you know, this is the third bedroom. This room is huge. You could put a wall here. It would give us the perfect space for a master bathroom. Oh. It feels so much better outside. So, what do you think? You on the "Save It" train yet? I'm on the "Save It" train always, but this feels absolutely crazy. I mean, $154,000 seems like a lot of money for this house. It's the area, probably needs, what, about $150,000 worth of work? - At least. So at the end of the day, maybe we get 400, just below for it. For the selling price that we need for this home, we're going to have to make sure it's great. So you're in? The thing that worries me is we're going to be having a baby in 2 months. I just need some sort of idea that we can get this done before then. We got to shoot for it. We have to get it done before the baby. - I'm all in. - We're doing this. We're doing this. Come on. Let's go. - Get it done in 2 months. Let's go. I'm making the offer right now. Yeah! We were finally able to purchase this house, and I got for 154,000. It's one of the biggest houses we've ever done, and I promised Ashley I'd get it done in 8 weeks before I gets here. This house is in a really sought-after historic district, so we're going to restore it to how it looked a century ago. So I want to lose the second door, repair the porch while maintaining the brick columns, and remove all the aluminum siding, which I'm really hoping is protecting the original siding. In the living room, I want to return these French doors back to being pocket doors, and then we can widen the opening into the hallway. In the dining room, we're going to case out part of this wall between the hall, creating an opening that would showcase our Victorian staircase. This kitchen is tiny. In an old house, you're sometimes stuck with these small rooms, so being able to steal some space from the bathroom for a pantry and a refrigerator is really going to make this space feel larger. That will give us plenty of room on the other side of the kitchen to put in new cabinets, countertops and appliances. Upstairs, if we take about a third of the second bedroom and put up a wall, it will give us the perfect space for a master bathroom. We'll tear down the old closet, and then we'll have room for a walk-in shower. We'll complete the room by adding a toilet over by the window with a double vanity sink. After we transform this home, I don't think we're going to have any problem finding a high-end buyer. If the rain stays just like it is now, we might actually stay on schedule. Right. I don't think we're doing any exterior demo today, but there's a lot to do so we'll be all right. All right. Let's go do this. Y'all ready? - Ready or not, here we come. Today, we've got a lot to cover. We're going to demo a couple of kitchens. You know, in this downstairs kitchen, we've got take out the kitchen cabinet, singular cabinet, singular. So we should try to keep it. What we would keep this for? I don't know. That's the usual answer, "I don't know but keep it." Yeah. Just pull it. Whoo! We've got to get rid of this sink. Definitely going to let these three guys do the heavy lifting. Keep going. There we go. She's free. Adios, baby. One kitchen down, one more to go. This isn't a duplex anymore. We don't need this upstairs kitchen. It's going to be a great space for an additional bedroom. Holy... Ash! Trying to get me out here in the rain. You cannot imagine how much concrete is under this house. Look at this. - Oh, my God. What is that? You cannot imagine how much concrete is under this house. - Look at this. - Oh, my God. What is that? So they just poured a concrete porch on top of a concrete porch. This is worse than I've ever seen. Yeah, I'm not messing with... So this is a lot more demo than we expected. Yeah. It's a lot of extra time, the weight going to the dump. At the end of the day, this porch really needs to be rebuilt correctly, and it looks like it's needed to be rebuilt correctly... - For a long time. - ...for a long time. Hopefully be able to support the columns so that we can keep them. These brick columns give it a nice feel to this house, so ideally, we'll be able to remove all this concrete without disturbing these brick columns and build our new porch. If they come smashing down, that's more money onto the budget. Not a good discovery but I mean, we're going to have to deal with it. It needed to be found. Well on our way. So we'll remove this tub, all the tile around it and that's the area that we'll be able to bump our fridge in from the kitchen and then maybe get some sort of pantry in there as well. All right. You know we're very early on in the demo. There's a lot to do, feels a little stressful right now. This house has to, like, open and close its book before we can start our new chapter in our life. Baby steps here before we have baby steps over here. Yeah, I'm dizzy. You know, the tub looks like it's in pretty good shape. Why send it to the dump when it's like a perfectly good tub? They don't make them like this anymore. Save it. I'll be here if anybody needs me. Hey! I got to get you back to work. With the tub out, it's going to give us the space we need in the kitchen to bump in the fridge and pantry. It's going to be prime real estate and exactly what we need to kind of expand this kitchen a little bit. It stopped raining. This seems like the perfect opportunity to look underneath this aluminum siding and see what kind of condition the original siding is in. I know. We need it to be good because we got to save some money somewhere. I don't even know the cost if we had to re-side this house. More than we want to spend. I'm just going right in, picking the middle. Coming in. I don't even know the cost if we had to re-side this house. More than we want to spend. I'm just going right in, picking the middle. Coming in. Whoo! Look at that. It's perfect. It does look perfect. That looks really good. The metal has actually protected it all these years because, you know, under the porch it was semi protected but it still looks bad. But this looks amazing. - Yeah. It's really pretty cypress. - Bugs don't like the cypress. - I know. Ideally, the rest of the house looks like this, and we can just roll, get the outside done in no time. It's going to look great, and it looks like it's not going to be a hit to the budget. So that's a big win for the day. Absolutely. Let's go back inside, dry off. This is one of those moments where my hoarding tendencies is going to pay off. We are going to storage to look for something we can turn into a vanity for the new master suite. Let's see what we got. It's going to be some cool stuff in there. Lots and lots of stuff. I've got this old sewing cabinet. This one doesn't work because it's small. I want a double vanity. We have this old dry sink here. It's definitely over 100 years old. You know, before indoor plumbing, this would've just, like, held a bowl. I think this is our best option. It doesn't stick out as far either, so we're still going to get two sinks in here. I mean, if we go buy a vanity, it's going to be like everybody else's. So this is going to give us a little extra character in this new bathroom. Not going to ask you to help me carry it. My goodness, it's heavy. At least we picked a piece out. You can come back and get help with it later. All right. Our typical demo on these houses takes just about a day, but the size and state of this old house, I'm thinking this one is going to take 2 maybe even 3 days. What do you think about taking some of this beadboard off, taking some of the paneling off on the other side, really quick, just so we can see through? I mean, if you attack that side and I get the beadboard on this side, I mean, 5 minutes, we'll be able to look through here. Game on. Do you think you could do your side faster than I could do my side? Absolutely. Any time you can make it a competition, I mean, it's a win-win because you actually want to do it and you do it quicker because you want to win. And I'm a winner. I'm a winner. - How far we going to go? - As far as it takes me to win. So there's always these contests that go on. Trying to get through quicker. Does this mean I won? I'll concede. Good. I and I need a break. - Wow. - Oh, that's so good. The transition French to pocket, I'm fluent in French. This house had a remodel, and they originally would've had pocket doors. And then with that remodel, they put in these French doors. It must have been the "it" thing to do, but now we have this small living room and furniture needs to go in here. And with the swinging of these large doors, see this? I mean, there's no room for anything, anybody. They got to go. So we'll remove the French doors and then remove all the casing. It looks like there's an old pocket door track in there, and I think we're just going to, like, add our new track on top of it. Coming at you. - Whoo! Let's go to Mama. Oh, yeah. Got it. We're going to be reusing all of these pieces, so we're going to be really gentle in taking them off. All these pieces are, like, coming off perfect. Did you have any doubt? - Whoa, be careful. - That's it. Whoo! She's free. Look at that little pocket door hole. Get the track put up. - Four wheels. - All right. So as long as we have this center line here drawn, well be able to put our wheels right in the middle. Now this is actually the strongest part of the door as well. You know, if you mounted your wheels right here in the middle, that section is already cut. So you want to mount it on a long side... Yeah. ...because that holds the most weight. All right. Let's get this up. This house hasn't had pocket doors in, like, 100 years. Whoa. Dang it. The door has way more of a gap on one side than the other side. Like, look. Come look at it. You see? Yeah. It's not square. It's not square at all. Maybe just because they had to swing, they put an awkward little cut on the bottom of it so it didn't gouge the floor. So you need to make an angled cut. These doors have always just swung, and they weren't square. We have to take a little cut off the top, take a little cut off the bottom, square them up so they slide nice and neat. Let's not mess these up. They're the only doors we have, and if you get it wrong, we're not putting new doors back in there. We're not buying more, so we'd just be doorless. My cut will be steady. Whoo! Let's get this thing up. All right. You're clamped. Whoo! Pocket doors in the house. Now that we've got these pocket doors versus the swinging, we've saved a lot of, like, valuable square footage in that living room. - These are smooth. - Butter. Let's get the other one up, and then we are good to go. No problem. Are we on track to finish before the baby gets here? We're still on track. It's always tight. Zeke, we getting ready for some headers. - Yes. - Downstairs feels tight here. So one of the most important things we can do is kind of give the illusion of some more space. You know, we can't change the square footage, but we can open up some doorways. All right, man. Let's get cutting. We're going to cut all the old studs, pull them out, and we'll set our header. - Perfect. An entirely new look in this dining room. Oh, wow. Look at y'all. She's open. This looks good. I mean, it makes the room look so much bigger. All the difference in the world. After we threw up this header in the dining room, we went into the living room and widened up this cased opening from the hallway. So we're missing all the lower spindles, but we still have a bunch of them up here. You know, they don't make them anymore. So we need to, like, get one of these out so we can get it to a woodturner. You know, I want to make sure that we don't, like, break any of this because that's just more money to the budget. So hopefully we can just lightly tap this over and then get that last one out. The concern in getting one of these spindles is out is doing it gently. Let's just barely take this up so we don't loosen all these. You've got to basically remove the handrail in order to loosen it enough to pop one out. They're all going to come off. Careful. Careful. So you want to pop one of these spindles out, but you don't want to pop them all out. They're all going to come off. And you don't want it to just... All of a sudden, they're all going everywhere. - Wiggle it gently. - Got it. Whoo! Look at that. They don't make them like this anymore, you know, with the little wooden peg, and the craftsmanship in all this is just amazing. I think we need, like, 30 of these. Yeah, we do need 30 for sure. I'm happy we have a pattern to go off of so we know what to match. All right, let's get these off to Willy. Today, the one thing we had planned was to really get this aluminum siding off the house. It looks really good. I am building the frames for our hutch here. We got to rebuild some doors to kind of match the old ones for the uppers. We're going to inset them with glass. This thing has been here for 100 years, buying doors are not an option. - Hey. - What's up? Your frame is coming along. Yeah. These doors look exactly like the ones on the lower, except they're going to have glass in them which is going to give us a little bit of, you know, a place to put some pretty stuff like the decorative stuff. You put all your, like, Christmas bows, all your, like, leftover ribbons like when you like get a gift but you can't throw the ribbon away. Are you my grandma? What are you talking about, not throwing a ribbon away? Goes on the bottom. Don't open the hutch in our house. That's some pretty glass. Dug it out of storage so we could use it for the glass doors of the hutch. I think it'll be cool, like some old, wavy glass to give the hutch just a little bit more character, like the doors have always been there. And with a little cutting, it'll be perfect. Let's confirm our measurement. Good. Wavy glass is actually a little more difficult to cut because it's got all these natural little grooves and stuff in the glass. The imperfections, that's what we're going for. I know we're going for the imperfections, but the cuts like to travel along those imperfections. And then we're going to hang it over the edge a little bit. Give it a little tap-aroo. That'll work. The moment of truth, I'll get your frame, sir. - It fits. - It fits. - Looks good. - It's going to look great. There's our doors. - I love it. That looks really good. You ready to get all this concrete out of here? It is time. It's looking good, Phillipe. The main goal on this porch is to keep these brick columns whenever we do the demo. So the guys have, like, built some supports in here, and hopefully, that's going to be all we need to hold everything together. Fingers crossed. I just want to get all this out, and see if we can actually save these columns. Well, I'm going to sit back and let y'all do it. - You ready? - It's hammer time. - You better keep that baby safe. - I am. Oh, my gosh. Whoa. I'm a little nervous about Michael actually demoing the porch that he's standing on top of. Got to get right in there. Do you hear yourself, like how crazy that seems? I feel like I'm on like thin ice. Be careful. I love getting my hands dirty, so it's hard for me to just sit back and watch Michael have all the fun. But right now, they're hitting really close to the columns. This is starting to get a little unstable. Whoa! Whoa! So I'm sitting back. Michael looks like he's getting way too close to these columns. I'm thinking this sledge is probably the way to go. Man, that was a good splash. It's a lot of concrete. A lot of it gone, wow. Columns look great. I mean, they're still here. That was definitely the goal. We got to get all this rubble out of here so we can get the new deck built. Okay. I'm ready to get the new porch in here. It's going to make a big difference. I'm ready to get rid of this secondary door. I'm going to try to get those pins out of the door while you're working on that. Got one. It was as easy as I thought it'd be. I hate it when they're tough to get off. Old house stuff, babe. - I know. She's free. So much easier, out of the way. And you can just tell... Whoa! Gross. Look at all that. It's like rat poop. It's nature's confetti. Now we just need to get the back off, and this thing is out of there. All right. Pull it out, moment of truth. - All right. - Oh, lovely. Whoo! Hopefully that original door fits. Yeah. I just want to, like, try it out. Look at that. Want to come outside and look? Yes, I do. We got this. It's perfect. I'm ready to get the siding patched in this area. Just like it originally looked. Yeah. It's been a duplex too long. We've got a lot of paint prep going on today. We're scraping the exterior siding. They're priming all these nails so they don't rust through, and we'll be ready for a new paint job any day now. So it's exciting that this house is going to finally get that curb appeal that it needs. We've got a lot going on right now. We've got drywall going on. All the walls are primed and prepped. We've got floors being sanded. So it's kind of cool. I mean, it's still just a work zone, but you can kind of see it. I got the vision. Hey! I feel like this has been the most rain we could've had. All right. Well, if we can get kitchen cabinets in today and if we can get the banister up, it'd be a good day for a rain day. That'd be a great day. And this baby is coming rain or no rain. You've got to get this thing finished. - We'll get it done. - All right. Let's go check inside. - All right. It's like a week and a half before the open house, and this is a really big project. I've got too much stress going on right now. There's a van. Is it the cabinets? - Yeah, it's them. I mean, it's literally a lake. But the cabinets have arrived. What do you think? You want to come in through the back, down the alley, see what that looks like? The alley is no better, Michael. The alley is worse. Cabinet guys can't get cabinets inside. What did the cabinet people say? They went back to assemble at their shop and bring them back here. All right. - This is nuts. Our week gets really bad if cabinets don't go in today. We've got countertops in the next 2 days. There's a lot of work to do. They have to go in today. The cabinet guys are here, but it has rained so much, so quickly that we've got a lake outside. They can't even make it in. Our week gets really bad if cabinets don't go in today. We've got countertops in the next 2 days. There's a lot of work to do. They have to go in today. This is nuts. I think they can make it in. They just don't want to get their ankles wet. I don't want the cabinets wet either. We might have to wait this one out. We're going to start inside. Hopefully some of this rain will pass. We have spindles. Today, we get to install these spindles. We got them custom turned to match the old ones. This project, I think we're just going to pop them in, boom, boom, boom. Going to be done, set our handrail on top, put some nails in, it's going to be great. I hope it's that easy too. Let's do this. - This goes here? - Yeah. Well, this is going to be such an awesome stairwell. - They're all done. - They look good. All right. I just worked on... This was not easy. It's a lot of futzing. - What do you think, Ash? - I'm ready. This is the whole reason we cased this opening out. Oh, wow. Everything was to see the stairwell, and it's back now. That looks awesome. This is what this would've looked like when the house was built. It's kind of cool to have that back. It stopped raining. Thank gosh. The sun came out so we can get the cabinets installed. It's late in the day though. I hope they can get it all done. - You matched it today. - I did. What do you think of the colors? - I love it. I actually, I think these greens really complement the brick well. The brick columns aren't something you see a lot of times on these houses, so the fact that we were able to save them is pretty cool. I hear a lot of work going on inside. Let's go check it out. - All right. Let's do it. The open house is just a few days away, and we are nowhere near being ready. I mean, Michael has promised me he's going to get this house done before the baby comes. - That's accurate. It's a tight timeline. Still feeling accurate. We've had a lot of rain. Rain is never good for a construction schedule. It's held up a lot, but I'm hoping we can get back on track. The master bath is really going make a huge transformation today. Marble is on the way in. Come on, back up, incoming. So the countertop guy is actually going to bring just solid marble walls for the shower, so it's going to go together really quick. It's just going to give a really classy look that you don't see a lot. No grout lines. We got solid walls. I kind of liked the idea of being able to keep the brick. It's going to be a feature inside the shower that's already a feature. Oh, my gosh. Looks good, huh? Looks pretty, really, really pretty. All right. Dry sink, all we need to do is get this prepped and ready for our last little piece of marble. We're going to pop this top piece off. There you go. I'm going to put kind of a ledger board across the back here, just a little strip of wood. And then we'll put a piece of plywood on top of it. And then all of this is going to help support the marble. Now we'll just cut the holes. Is it heavy? Everything in this bathroom seems like it's really heavy. I mean, it's a solid slab of stone, right? This is the moment. Whoo! Look at that. There it is. All right. Let me go grab the sinks. Want one? - I do. It's about, like, right there. Ash, these are awesome. This is such a cool look. This is going to be a focal point when you look in through the door of the bathroom. So we've come a long way with these stairs, you know, the new spindles, just getting everything cleaned up. This is, like, the final, like, finishing touch. So we got this from the printer, and it's, like, a painting that's going to up the stairs. So the staircase in this home is, like, the focal point when you come in the door. I like the idea that we're actually going to be able to, like, look up the risers and just see a cool painting. The staircase is going look like it looked originally with just a little extra pizzazz. This is like a marine gray vinyl that's already been laminated on the outside. I feel like if you can wrap a boat with this, you should be able to do this with it. Only like 10 more to go. It'll never finish. Today is the day. Open house day. What about the transformation this house has had? This place looks so good. We've been working on this house for a while now. It's finally done. In 2011, we saw the house, and it was abandoned. Now it's a beautiful stunning home. Back in 2011, we were dating, and now we're about to have a baby. This house was once the worst house on the block. Now it's a beautiful example of a historic home that really fits in with this neighborhood. The exterior of this house was really rough. This front porch was literally crumbling. Now it's completely rebuilt. It looks fantastic. The guests are going to be here any minute. Let's do it. Oh, I could totally, like, drink iced tea out here. This was a gutted duplex when we first bought it. Now, it's a single-family home, ready for a new family to come in. Wow. Oh, the stairs are beautiful. The first thing you see when you walk into the side hall Victorian is the staircase, so we made sure we made it a real focal point for this house. - Hi. - Wow, look at the stairs. That's pretty cool. - Staircase was scary before. Now, everything looks as it should, and it looks fantastic. Love the colors. It's beautiful. There wasn't a lot of changes that needed to be made in the living room. We just cased out the opening from the front door, and then reinstated the French doors into pocket doors. I think this living room is my favorite room in the house. These were French doors... - Oh, wow. ...and that's kind of that kind of craftsman feel. We were able to save the flooring throughout the house and added some new paint onto the wainscoting. It really came together, though, to give this a nice inviting space when you first enter the house. This dining room, nobody would want to eat here. Now it actually feels like a room where you'd want to do that. We just cased out an opening, kind of restored the hutch, new paint, and she was ready to go. I like the hutch. - Oh, wow. - Great kitchen. There wasn't much of a kitchen to speak of when we first bought this house. Now it's beautiful. It's, like, ready for, like a holiday dinner, like a full spread. Plenty of room for activities in this kitchen. - The woodwork is amazing. - It all came together. Oh, wow, beautiful. There's a lot of, like, features in this master bedroom. - Wow! - Look at this. I've never seen anything like that. We've got the original wood floors. We've got the exposed brick chimney. A private porch. This is the first time I've seen a walk-through window up close. This is awesome. Oh, wow. That's beautiful. More marble, looks great. Nobody wants to share their bathroom with their guests, so the fact that this house has a master bathroom is pretty cool. And this wasn't here before. This is a difference maker. - I love the sinks. - It's the perfect space. We were actually able to get double vanity sink in this bathroom by making this dry sink into, like, a modern day vanity. It all came together. We spent $154,000 to purchase this house and renovated it for just under 140,000. We are all in at just under 300,000, and we plan to list this house for $399,000. After interest and realtor fees, we stand to make a profit of about $65,000. You want to live here? - Yes. - Okay. Michael got lucky, and he finished this thing before the baby arrived. She's still inside. The sale of this home is going to be a nice little savings account for I. - Yeah, it is. - I'm pretty proud. It's beautiful.
