From Kolkata? - Absolutely. I am Dr Satyam Rana. That means a chemistry professor. You are a history lover and have come early morning. Actually, there is a litmus paper in your pocket. And the mobile screen saver is a kekule structure. Means benzene ring. No, I said that because you said you were a doctor. Strange. If you were not passionate about history then for the past 5 minutes. Would not be observing this so minutely. And of course, would not have been able to rectify me. And what about coming early at dawn? I saw your last picture on your mobile. Isn't it today's sun rise in the gallery? Let's go. The ocean is next to this. The Europeans boatsmen's landmark was this temple. Excuse me. Hello. Tell me your name at least. What's your name? I am Kiriti Roy and she is my wife Krishna. Greetings.

Tell me, how are you? How can I be? Duty from early morning. Have found a dead body floating at the beach early in the morning. Today's kids, must have been drunk. Has the body been identified? - Yes. Sona Ali. A waiter in one of the hotels of Puri. Which hotel? Blue View. Didn't we go to Blue View today? Wont you go to the beach? Dr Rana. Wont you come? Come on, lets go. Hello... What do you think? Water has accumulated in the stomach. He has dozed off while being drunk. Yes. Did you find the mobile? - No. Are you suspecting something else? Rigor Mortis has set in. That means he drowned early morning. And Konark is 35kms away from Blue View. Check the last tower location for once. If he drowned in Puri is it possible to be found in Konark? For Ali to leave like this. I can't believe. He asked me for leave yesterday. Leave for a week. I granted. After that. He committed suicide. Stop here. Mr Kiriti Roy. Excuse me, Mr Roy. Yes. You? Good morning. I am Debashish Mohanty, IPS. I am investigating Sona Ali's case. Sit down. - Thank you. Mr Pattanayak has sent me the details of the earlier case. Post mortem report. Let me see. An over dose of sleeping pills. Apart from this I have come to know. He had boarded the bus from Puri to Kolkata But how he reached Chandrabagha. Is still unclear. So, it is Zepam. Yes. Where is Ali's mobile? Not found yet. Why? - This is not case of suicide. It is a murder. - Murder? I mean Zipam is used for insomnia. It also intoxicates and used for rape cases. That's why it is called date rape drug. Then, sir. Track Ali's mobile. Okay sir. - Hey dear. Enough of this, let's go. My wife Krishna. And he is IC Debashish Mohanty. - Greetings. Wont we go out? Let's go. Give me 2 minutes. Hurry up. I am ready. - Sure. Yes, speak. Hotel Blue View. What time? Okay. What's wrong? There has been a theft at hotel Blue View. Blue View? I want to go there once. - Sure. Yesterday I was passing by from here. Suddenly I heard a noise. But I couldn't see anyone inside the room. Today the sweeper while sweeping the room. Shouted out to me. When I came. I saw. Everything was thrown all around. I can't understand anything. What happened, I don't know. It is good for your hotel. Publicity. A waiter got killed, theft in the hotel. Hadn't you come before? Mr Kiriti Roy. Detective. I had come in search of Kali. He is my old neighbor. Oh, then good for you. Runa madam is very reputed here. She runs the Navrang theatre on lease. Is it? - He is investigating Ali's case. What? Ali's murder? - Yes ma'am, he was murdered. Mr Mohanty. - Yes sir. Get me powder. - Sure. New game. Looks like arch. What is this? It looks like a chart. Keep this. I will take it. - Sure. Once the preliminary investigations are done. And reports come, send me this chess board. Okay sir. Has Kali left something valuable behind? Do you know? No, I don't. Did you call Kali Sarkar? I did. First it was not reachable then it was switched off. Room keys? One set of keys is at the hotel. And one with him. And this is kept booked for him. New oriental jewelers. Yes, he dealt in jewelry business. Under the name of new oriental jewelers... What must be the approximate time of theft? I remember it. I always return home at the time. Okay, where did Sony Ali live? He lived upstairs. He will show you the way. Let's go and see. - Okay. Mrs Sanyal. Please be careful. Wow, everything is expensive here. - Yes, everything branded. Mr Mohanty. This is a shop of condoms. Actually, Ali was a very fancy guy. He would exercise, wore expensive perfumes. And was very close to Kali sir. Are you too? - No sir. Okay, you can go. - Okay sir. Mr Roy. - Sir. New Oriental Jewelers. Who owns this hotel? Runa's husband, Harit Sanyal. Where is he? I didn't see him. The relation between them are strained. Ali seems to be an interesting character. Oh Mr Roy, diary. Oh Mrs Sanyal. What was Ali's salary? 6000 rupees. 6000? And such expensive things. Did Ali know Kali Sarkar? Ali was Kali's favorite waiter. I think that's why he tipped him very grandly. Okay. I think. Maybe Ali was had some secret business with Kali Sarkar. Yes, it seems so. Because. The night Kali Sarkar went missing, Ali was murdered that night. Then Ali's phone is missing. Even Kali Sarkar's phone is switched off. Where is Kali Sarkar? Where are you? In Kolkata. When are you expected to come to Puri? Have booked the train tickets. Cancel it and take a flight. Before that, visit the house of owner of Oriental jewelers. Kali Sarkar. Go there and meet him and talk to him. Who is Kali Sarkar? I said what I knew. Ask about his business. And I want to know when he returned from Puri. I get it, but how will I recognize Kali Sarkar? I mean how? Tell him, you have often met him in Puri. And at his shop. You are interested in jewelry business. And your father has an old jewelry shop. By the way, your honeymoon is spoiled. Honeymoon in Puri has become mysterious now. Does Kali Sarkar live here? Bring him up. Come. He has come. I am... You have come to meet me? Yes. Mr Kali... Mr Kali? Who Kali? Listen, I have no relation with brother. And you must have come for business. Then listen to me. The jewelry business is being separated now. New oriental jewelers. Has been ruined. I am informing you this from before. If you do any kind of business with him. Then nobody from this house will be responsible for it. No, I mean, I have come to invest. If we can jointly do something. At your own risk. And bloody tell him. If he does anything wrong with the busines or the house. Then Jadu Sarkar will not spare him. Whom I met in Puri... Yes. Puri. Puri has doomed him. Let him return from Puri. I will deal with him. Womanizing and by his debauchery he wants to destroy us. Tel him this time, there will be confrontations. Has he returned back? - How will he return? How will be come back? If he returns, he will have to give back. He thought, by making a will, give property and all to her. Tell him. There will be blood bath. Sir, please listen to me. I... Get my tea. Listen. Do you want to say something? Why isn't he picking up the phone? Kali is not picking up my phone. I don't know. Can you say something? Both the brothers are fighting a lot. He said he would kill Kali. What I heard, is it true? After Leena's incident. - Who is Leena? She teaches in the school belonging to sir. She is very friendly with him. Come here. You please go. Go. The accident which happened. Brother, said Leena was responsible. And Kali says, brother has done it. Where are you? - Coming. He has written all his property to be given to Leena. Do you know, where is he? Maya. - Coming. Sir. Couldn't you come earlier? I am sorry. Okay I am doing it. Hurry up. You come here, every year.

Where is your wife? Excuse me. - Yes. So please welcome to Kyoto. - Sure. I am waiting for you there. - Thank you. This is a present for you. Bye. She has gone shopping. I came to meet a friend of mine. - Oh okay, let me introduce. He is Harit Sanyal. Greetings. Any update on Ali? No, nothing as of now. But waiter was a colorful character. He was an idiot. Got spared. I think Kali Sarkar has murdered him. And has escaped. Yes, I too think so. Excuse me, I am getting a call. Hello. I said you will get it. Why are you worrying. Yes. You will get it. - You... Aren't you the owner of Blue View Hotel? Name sake. Runa runs it. I am spendthrift. My wife doesn't like it. I actually don't like doing business. I am a simple man. Play cards, while away my time. That's how I live my life. Ali was Kali Sarkar's special waiter. Did you know that? Don't ask me all this. I am not involved in this. A boarder books his room for the whole year in your hotel. Involved with the waiter. Won't you keep a track? Kali Sarkar was not actually a boarder. He had once loaned money when the hotel was in trouble. That's it. Partner? Not that. Then. Acquaintance. Chats with Runa. Invests when needed. Converting black money to white. You don't have any kids? No. Love marriage? 'Excuse me. Good morning. Good morning. It is the opening of my hotel. I need a bouquet of flowers. Okay, great sir. Choose, there are many. What would you like? What ever you like send me 5000 pieces of that. Of my choice? 5000 thousand pieces? Send it here. At Puri? Don't they have good florist at Puri? Send it.' They were a few flower shops at Puri. But not like the ones at New Market at Kolkata. She did send flowers a few times. Then we started talking. Is your home in Kolkata? Mine? It was once. Runa... I mean. Mine was late marriage. Runa's second. Her first relation with husband was broken. And I fell in love. What can I say about my heart, my friend? It is worse than innocent kids. I stumble at every step. For a bit of love. Kali Sarkar is missing. Phone switched off. Ali killed. I am so sorry baby, you had to have your lunch alone. I could have come earlier... What's this? What have you done? Have you gone mad? Have you forgotten this is a hotel room? Not your home. Whole day, I will go mad. You won't get it Krishna. Even I am unable to understand. Here. Look at this. - What? All the wrong moves of the chess are written in Kali's diary. What do you mean wrong moves? - 2 RMRG 4.00. There is no move in chess like this. And why there is a mention of Alekhine's repeatedly. What does that mean? Here it is. When the queen backs up to two rooks on the same file. Why? I don't understand anything. Please it is all going beyond me. Okay leave all that, and come here. Please come here for once. Look what I have bought for you. Come here and see what I have got. Okay dear, show me. What is it? Sepoy of palm leaves. Wow. - Isn't it sweet? Lovely. Thank you so much. Reminds me of my childhood. My father had bought it for me at the fair. I rotated it very fast. It's hands and legs broke before I reached home. Hey you know, I saw that girl at Pippli today. Whom? - The girl who was sitting at the reception of Blue View Hotel. With a red color candy bag. With red hair like a flower. All women love to shopping. Oh, so now it is a woman's fault? When did I blame? Even the sardar was there. - Which Sardar? Don't you remember, whom we saw in front of Navrang theatre. Yes, Kiriti listen. Kali Sarkar has a dispute with his brother. He has willed all his property to a woman called Leena. Brother is angry. Leena. - Yes, Leena. The school which is named after Leena Kali's mother. Leena teaches English and scouts there. Scouts? Yes. Next. I think she is having an affair with Kali. Kali Sarkar had met with an accident. Brother thinks, Leena is involved. And Kali Sarkar thinks, he has done it. Leena has taken leave from school for many days. Medical leave. Red big bag. Wonderful Subrata. Anything else. Lunch in Puri. You are most welcome. Oh Mr Roy, please come in. There is an important development. What development? There is a place in Kolkata called Babu ghat. There on the bus service way between Puri and Kolkata. We have found the mobile of Kali Sarkar. On the last seat of Dolphin express bus. His mobile was found inside a bag. Where is the phone now? Phone is with me now. After I got the phone. It was switched off. Did you know in whose bag this mobile was? Whose? Sona Ali. The bag from the bus of Puri to Kolkata. Kali's phone in Ali's bag. This mystery is not yet cleared, Mr Roy. Kali received calls from these numbers. Out of these one is of Runa madam. The other one is yours. Yes, he is my old acquaintance. He used to receive calls from one more number. From a girl called Leena. - Leena. She has been calling since many days. I have tracked her location. And found that Leena madam is in Puri now. Hello. - I got a call from this number. Is it Leena speaking? - Yes, speak. I am Kiriti Roy. I wanted to talk to you about Kali Sarkar. Tell me. There is a dilapidated house at the end of marine drive. Meet me there in half an hour. Don't worry, you will not be harmed. Why will I come? Kali Sarkar has made a will in your name. And then he has gone missing. You too are searching Kali since many days. I am aware of that. You are definitely interested in Kali. Did you get the Will? Miss Leena. Which will? Kali Sarkar has made a will and has named you. Mine? Kali met with an accident in Kolkata, so he escaped to Puri. He didn't pick up his brothers call. And not yours too. Because he suspected your involvement in the accident. The morning when you went to Blue View. The night before, Kali left for Kolkata. Kali is in Kolkata? His phone was found in a bus depot. Did you get the will? Since when you are saying the same thing. I haven't received any will. And what kind of will. Will in which Kali is giving you everything. When you didn't find Kali at Blue View. You searched his room at night. What rubbish are you saying? Why will I do that? I am Kali Sarkar's wife. We are not traditionally married. But we are husband and wife. I am trying to search him everywhere. I am going mad. And you are going on asking me about the will. Then why did you not inform the police? Why did you hang a bedsheet from the verandah and tied the scout knot? What rubbish are you talking? The scars on both your hands. The smell of Nina Ricci perfume on the bed sheet. And nobody can tie the knot except a scout, Leena. I think you are an English and scout teacher at Kali's school. Isn't it? If you know so much, then you should also know. From whom Kali is absconding? From whom? - From his brother. His brother wants to kill him. And you surely know who. From whom Ali has an adulterous relation with. Actually, you know. You should not completely believe what you see. Whom are you talking about? You don't know anything at all. Just calling me here and wasting my time. First find Kali. Then you will get all your answers. Stop. Push her inside. - Where are you taking me? Get in. - Help. Leave me. - Move. Stop. Stop it. The incident occurred in this room? - Yes. I think from the terrace of that house. The ballistic report will confirm. But I think Debashish. This is a single barrel gun. Telescopic. In Puri. What news about Mrs Sanyal? Better. The bullet grazed through her shoulder. She will be discharged today evening. Strong willed. Once worked with the circus. Yes, one more thing. Was drunk during the incident. Got saved, because drunk. Mohanty, increase the security of Mrs Sanyal. Collect all these evidences and send it to the forensic. Okay. Yes Subrata, listen to me carefully. Go to new market and investigate about the florists there. If anybody knows Runa Sanyal. Have asked Mr Bose to help you. I want Runa Sanyal's history. When did you join CID? A month ago. Have got information. A guy was working for the florist at New market. Lost his job because of addiction. He might know about Runa. Hey, who is there? Get up. Go. Hey you stop. Stop. This is your man. What do you know about Runa Sanyal? I am not feeling well now. I don't have anything. Take. She was working at the florist's shop. Then she married a man and went away somewhere. She was very pretty looking. Many guys were pursuing her. With whom did the girl go? In Puri? The one who runs the hotel in Puri? In Kolkata. Jeweler of Kolkata. What was the name? Name. Actually. I don't have a job now. - I get it. Kali Sarkar. During the times of the great Lord. Wonder why the whole city of Puri is surrounded by a mystery. Because of this whiff of mystery, the city is still surviving. Mrs Sanyal, who are you? I? I am Runa Sanyal. Owner of Hotel Blue View. And my husband's name is. - Kali Sarkar. You met both of them, at the florist shop at New Market. Kali Sarkar and Harit Sanyal. I had married Kali Sarkar. I had many dreams. I loved a lot. First love. After a few days I understood that... He wasn't worthy of me. Then? I went back. So, he booked a room for the whole year in the hotel. Fate. Destiny Mr Roy. How to run this huge business? I was married. I met Kali after 5 years. Right here. I was busy running this hotel then. And Harit. In spending money. The hotel that you see today, Mr Roy. It wasn't like this. This is all my hard work. Harit cannot understand that. And Kali Sarkar? He did help. Helped me in running this hotel business. Why? If someone feels he should do something for me. Why should I object? Mrs Sanyal, who could have shot you? Everyone. Harit would be happy to kill me. And if I am not there Kali would benefit. Your husband doesn't like Kali Sarkar. You do know that. Did he tell you? He doesn't like. They gamble and drink together. A curse. Do you have any kids from Kali Sarkar? From Harit? No. It was purposely, Mr Roy, please. - No thank you. Your mother's mark can be clearly seen, Mrs Sanyal. Get plastic surgery done. However, much you try. The scars will give away. Kali and me had a child. But he lived only for 4 months. But... How is this related to me being shot? Look Mrs Sanyal. Ali's dead body has been found. On the sea beach. Near Kali Sarkar gambling den. His bag went to Kolkata. And Kali Sarkar's phone was found in his bag. There is a lady named Leena's number in that phone. Kali Sarkar has written his will in the name of Leena. While coming to Puri, Kali meets with an accident. And whom does he escape and come to? To you. First wife of Kali. What is this? It is me. When I was 7-year-old. There was a competition called 'Go as you like'. I was the boy. Whom do you think could have killed Ali? Kali Sarkar. Why? Can't you understand, from where he got so much money? Relation with me was broken. You know why? Because Kali Sarkar... Was bisexual. Please be careful. Harit. Where are you? Hurry up and come. Kiriti had come. "I was in love with the moon." "What did I know?" Yes Mohanty. Harit is murdered? I am coming. Puri club. Quickly. Harit was using an iPhone? No, he used this phone. Look, that's Kali Sarkar. You are right. Now Kali Sarkar's motive is clear. He is hiding and killing everyone. Correct. First, he killed Ali. And kept his phone in his bag. Right. - To prove he is missing. He told Runa Sanyal, that he was checking out. Then he attempted to shoot Runa. And then at Harit Sanyal. Look, can you see anything unnatural? Look how nicely he is walking behind. Suddenly he could run normally. You are right. Watch again. Look. No Kali, I didn't expect this from an intelligent man like you. It is so hot here. But it is a very pretty place. I got awesome clicks yesterday. Look. Please come here, now. Oh God. Look at the pics. This is a nice click. Very nice. Hello. Hey you. I am talking since when, but you can't hear anything. What's the matter? You can't hear? What gibberish are you writing? Sicilian defense. Rosalino variation. This is 4 and this is 5. Come on, I can't play chess with you at night. Wont you sleep? I am going to sleep. Please come and sleep, it is very late. Ruined my honey moon. Always working. I don't like this. Irritating. Why did you switch off the light? Ali. Who has murdered you? Kali Sarkar. Kali has deceived me. Why? I have found Illegal property worth of 1 billion rupees. Harit. That's why he killed me. Kali Sarkar. Interesting. Who is here so late at night? Mr Kali, so late at night? Kiriti. I have an important work. Come inside. Come. Tell me, what's the matter? I have made a mistake. I have killed 2 people. Why? They came to know all my secrets. Illegal move, Kiriti. Now it is your turn. I don't spare anyone who comes to know about my secrets. What do you mean? Mr Kalia. What are you doing? Mr Kali. If I don't kill Krishna and you. My troubles will not be solved. You can't go to Ramrajpur. Krishna! What's the matter? What? Ramrajpur. Tell me, where have I heard this name? That day when we went to Navrang theatre. To watch the dance. Then one who were performing had come from Ramrajpur. That means RMRJ. Means Ramrajpur. Hey, you too have come. Come. Give me your bag. Ravana the enemy of Rama. Krishna. That's not Ravana but Sugreev. Sugreev? - Go to your Rama. At Ramrajpur. - Ramrajpur. Where is that? - In hell.

By Ali's phone location, we can guess. We can't find the phone. It was an expensive phone. Who found it has sold it? iPhone 5S. Who said it was iPhone 5s? Hotel's waiter. Jaganath. Thank you. - Where are you going? The great city circus at Navrang theatre. Be ready. Ramanuj. Ramanuj. Ramanuj. Ramanuj. Ramanuj. Ramanuj. - You have come. Dear son, you run away. Or else you will be caught. You run away dear. Where is the money? - Money. You run away, the cops are searching for you. Cops after you. - First, give me the money. Don't pretend anymore. Don't do this dear. The cops will search you and take all the money. Run away or else you will be caught. I don't believe you anymore. I don't believe. Runaway Ramanuj, please. - I don't trust you. What did you think? You will keep tricking me. And I will let it be. Now I will not let anyone trick me. I am your mother. Find me mother, I am hiding. Let me seek where my Ramanuj is hiding? Where is my little baby? Here is he. My little baby. Mother. Mr Roy, lower the mobile and the revolver. Keep it down. Did you shoot? No. He is... dead. Radha. Ramanuj. My son. Has died. What did you think? By ruining everything of mine, you will be able to escape? No. Trying to find Kali Sarkar. If not, he would have to pay. Hello Mr Roy. Mr Roy. Mrs Sanyal, there is no use of pointing a gun at me from the stage of Navrang theatre. Mr Roy. You have done it twice since morning. That you have pointed a gun at me. Look below for once, Mrs Sanyal. Everything of yours is ruined. Hello Arun. Will have to reach Navrang theatre. Prepare the force. I am used to bullets and guns, Mrs Sanyal. But are you prepared, for what I am going to say now? After Kali Sarkar went missing. I first suspected the Sikh who was eying Kali. Then Ali. The strong dose of medicine found in his stomach. Mobile too was missing. Then cropped up the name of your hotel. Blue View. Joining the dots, I got it. That everything began from this hotel. Kali's mobile was not getting connected. After attempting to rob, in Kali's hotel room. First, I thought it was you. Because you had the keys and boarder called you. And left at night. That was ruled out, as I saw the scout knot. I suspected and after investigating I found. Another character of the same play. Whose name was Leena. Sarkar's brown leather diary. There were many weird codes. In which it was mentioned where and how Kali's money was hidden. Then I understood in the draft, the ownership of New Oriental Jewelers was given to Leena. But the rest of Kali's black money was invested with you, Mrs Sanyal. But the problem was you needed this black money urgently. But why did Ali die? Mrs Sanyal, this is not a story of a broken marriage. There is something else hidden in it. I was shocked when I went to Ali's room. You had said there was a relation between Kali Sarkar and Ali. But according to me. Ali had a woman in his life. Someone who is very rich. But is bereft of a sex life. Such a woman. Who has no attachment with her husband? No strings attached. Childless. The scotch bottle in your room matched with the same branded bottle in Ali's room. It cleared my mind, Mrs Sanyal. 'You are always busy.' 'I am your slave.' 'Always busy with your phone.' 'Not at all. Go.' 'It is a call from your hotel.' Maybe Harit had caught you both in a compromising position. 'No. ' 'No say.' I assume because of Ali. You moved Kali Sarkar. This was proved when after a few day, Kali's mobile was found in Ali's bag. I thought a hired goon had killed Ali. For you. I didn't kill him. I know. Then Leena enters the scene. But before she could divulge anything, Leena gets kidnapped. You got wounded by a bullet and I Came to your house. Cycle was a model of 1998 and solar panel behind. It was not your picture, but of your son. When you were 7, the model of that cycle and solar panel were not invented, madam. When I was thinking about the motive of shooting you. It could have been Harit. There are two reasons for that. One your relation with Ali. Secondly Kali Sarkar for you, was bringing money to the hotel now. 'Kali Sarkar is actually not a boarder.' 'It is about converting the black money.' Wondered then, did Harit hire a goon to kill Ali and Kali. Could be. Before that could get cleared. Harit was murdered in front of Puri club. CCTV footage showed. Kali Sarkar wearing a cap and a sling, with a walking stick. The last thing was. Kali Sarkar escaped after killing Harit. But the trouble started when he ran away. It striked me. Out of all the places. Why did he kill in front of the cctv? Was it to prove that Kali was alive? By then I knew that Kali Sarkar's money was in the village of Ramrajpur. I met Radha, when I went in search of Kali to Ramrajpur. Friendly meeting. 'I know, who you are.' I saw the same picture at Radha's house. But torn. I understood, this was the child. In Kali's diary, he has written about a famous move in chess. When a queen backs up 2 rooks, in the same file. Thetwo people were you. Kali and Ramanuj. And it didn't take me long to find out who the queen was, Mrs Sanyal. Kali and your son. Wanted to became a woman. Needed almost 50 lakhs for the operation. At least the internet says that. Kali was not willing to give. By then you knew. Will had Leena's name in it. Is it wrong for a child to ask something from his dad? Absolutely not. But to use a single mistake of your son. What you did. Isn't that wrong? Mrs Sanyal? You will get everything. Everything. You just need to do one thing Ramanuj turns into Radha as soon as the makeup is applied. Then you thought, he could act as Kali Sarkar as well. It was confirmed when I came to know that Leena was called to meet Kali. But Kali was already dead. Then I was sure that, it was Radha. The child would have characteristics like the father. Rest was, make up. Kali had promised to give him the money. But didn't give. And Ramanuj hasn't killed Ali. I know. I assume, the one who made Kali meet with an accident in Kolkata. Is the one who has killed Ali. iPhone 5s. Which was with Ali. I saw the phone with Harit. Maybe Harit murdered Ali or got him killed. When did you know that? After Ali was killed. So, I guessed it right. You cannot even imagine. A broken family. Can bring such a huge curse in to the life of a child. It was such a deadly curse on me. He wanted to live in a different way. Everybody has the right to live their life, their own way. Mother, have you ever thought about me? When, I needed you most in my life. That time you were beginning your new life. You know, how lonely my life is mother. But it is all for you. I don't want mother. I... I just want to sleep on your lap. Help me mother. Help me. Kali loved Ramanuj. He just wanted him to live like a boy. One night... My brother wants to kill me. I am thinking of staying here forever. Leena will get her share. But you don't worry. I will pay all the expenses of this hotel. What about Ramanuj? I need 50 lakhs for Ramanuj's operation. You will have to give that money. Acting smart? Don't try to unnecessarily argue with me. Want to be a girl! God has sent him as a boy. It is okay if he remains as a son for me. Or else he will not get a penny from my property. Nothing. I understood, Kali will not give money. When I told Ramanuj, he called Kali. Without telling me, to Ramrajpur. No, I don't want to hear anything. I will not give you money. - I don't want to hear anything. No way will I give you money. I don't want to hear anything. We threw Kali's body in the great river. Couldn't you have waited a bit? I was trying to convince your father. That man is not my father. But I am your mother. You didn't think about me? Mother, have you ever thought about me? Give me my money. I will leave. You will get everything. Everything. You just need to do one thing. You have to kill Harit and Leena. Look. Whatever had to happen has been done. Kali is gone. If Harit and Leena leave. Then... Then everything is yours and mine. The day you finish this job. That day, you will get all the money. All the money. Yours and mine. Your greed and arrogance have, ruined you. Madam, it is someone else who writes our destiny. Mr Roy. Nobody can take that ability away from me. Tea for you madam. So, you are leaving tomorrow? What else to do? I had this stupid honeymoon. Why? Why are you calling it a stupid honeymoon? Mr Roy has solved such a wonderful mystery. What a dangerous woman. The puzzle was solved. Mrs Sanyal was a dynamic lady. Earlier she worked at Indian circus, isn't it? Yes, you are right. But it isn't Indian circus now. It is the great city circus. Oh yes. My mistake. She lost her job there because of money. No. She escaped after killing the manager. What are you saying? Hey Subrata, why are you giving me all wrong information? Isn't this a telescopic rifle? You friend has great tastes. You could say that. Actually, I too had a desire to be a detective. Okay what will be the range of the rifle which Subrata is holding? Oh this? This is 300 meters. 300 meter? - Yes. So, if the target is within 300 meters. What are the reasons that it can be missed? Normally this doesn't happen. And if he is a sharp shooter. Then there is no chance. Of course. - Until the target moves from its place. That day, Runa Sanyal missed it as she was drunk and was swinging. Isn't it? Yes, could be. Do you visit Blue View? Yes, I used to go. Along with Harit. To play cards. Yes, Harit, Kali and me. - And Ali. Yes, he too used to join at times. Then why did you not react when you saw Ali's body at a Chandrabaga? Is if you had never seen Ali before? After picking up Ali from the bus into your car. Give him a strong dose of drug and took him to Chandrabagha. And threw his body in the water. To take revenge from his wife. Harit paid you a handsome amount of money to kill him. Isn't it? Debashish. Yes, Mr Roy. The rifle in Subrata's hand was used to shoot from the terrace. So, doctor Rana. So finally, the whole mystery is solved. Shall we? Mr Roy, this is not right. Come on, get up. Krishna. Krishna please listen to me. Krishna. Krishna please listen. Please.
