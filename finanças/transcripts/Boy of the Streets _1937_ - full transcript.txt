[MUSIC PLAYING] [COMMOTION] Hey Rourke, [INAUDIBLE] the butcher shop. [INAUDIBLE] What are you talking about... all fool's day, Guy Fawkes day? I'm sure you were a kid once yourself. Yeah, that's right. [INAUDIBLE] someday. [LAUGHS] [COMMOTION] Sometimes, Gratton, I think we had better times than the kids have nowadays. We had to woods to tramp in, the fields to play in, and decent homes to live in. Look at these rat traps they call shelters. [SIREN] There comes the brains of the police department. What's up, [INAUDIBLE]? There's been a murder in apartment five. Stand by. Don't let anyone get away. I knew it was too quiet to last. I'll cover the rear. You live here? Yeah, apartment five. Apartment five? What do you know about a murder? A murder? That's me... Albert Murder. Hey Chuck, I just saw the cops go over to investigate the murder. And Old Man Murder's going to be scared to death. You know that, don't you? Let's see, fellows. What are we going to do now? Well, let me see. Hey Spike, come here. You got a [INAUDIBLE]? Yeah, yeah. Oh, let's see. Um, we'll send in a false alarm... tell them there's a great big fire. Tell them at, um, 625 Ninth Avenue. But I don't want to get caught. You ain't going to get caught. Now go on! Send somebody else. [INAUDIBLE] Fellows, we got to think of something different. We been sending in firearms, and burglars and drunks all night. Yeah, we've sent in a [INAUDIBLE] in darn near every street in town. Well, let's see. Operator? There's a fire at 625 Ninth Avenue, flames pouring out the window. POLICE OFFICER ON RADIO: Calling cars... 8, 14, to 17. Proceed to 625 Ninth Avenue... fire reported there. Calling cars... 8, 14, 17. Hello? I'm Chief Cronan talking. Yeah, another false alarm. Why don't you put down your checkerboards and do something about it? What do you mean, do something? We've got the homicide squad, the traffic department, and the Sheriff's office tracing the calls. Yeah, he's pretty hot they had to [INAUDIBLE] on him. I wonder who could have did that? [LAUGHING] What's the matter with you? Nothing, just little... little bit of nervous. That's all. You're doing all right, Spike. Let's see, we got to think of another one. Hey, you got another, Slug? Sure thing. Um, what's the... what's the number of that place around the corner? Uh, 124. One tw... here. Tell them there's a dead body in 124 Merrill Street. Go on. Now... now wait a minute, Chuck. [INAUDIBLE] two minutes. [GRUMBLING] I'll [INAUDIBLE]. If anybody's squawks, I'll tell them you haven't out of here all night. Go on. They'll get a kick when they find out it's an undertaker parlor. [LAUGHING] Undertaker parlor? Uh-oh. Hello? [INAUDIBLE] Are you there? Is this the police department? Rourke speaking. Send over the wagon. I got some customers for you. Hey, hand me the phone book. We'll get something good. Outgrown [INAUDIBLE] have you? Looking for real trouble, eh? Come on, you've had enough fun for one night. Where you taking us? Where do you suppose? What have we done? You should ask that with a telephone book in your hand. Get going, before you have the boys dragging the river for an automobile. Say, when my old man hears about this, you're going to be minus a badge. You've said enough for one night. Come on. Come on. Why don't you put handcuffs on us? You don't need handcuffs. All you'll need is something to button up that big mouth of yours. Gentlemen, the carriage is waiting. Hey! How long they going to keep us here. Quit your squawking. They're going to serve breakfast pretty soon. They always do. Can we order anything we want? Ham and eggs? Hot cakes? Yeah, you can order it, but you get coffee and mush just the same. Come on, kids. Line up here. Be careful what you say. What's the matter, you scared? No, but when you get to talking, you talk a little overtime. JUDGE: Come on, you kids. Come on. Aren't you Spike? Yeah. What are you doing down here? You've never been here before, have you? No, sir. JUDGE: Well, what are you're doing here now? Why, you're a good boy. You have a shoe shining stand. You work hard. Why do you want to start running out with these hoodlums for? Now be a good little boy. Go on home, and keep away from these bad boys. Come on. Yeah... yes, mister. Well, come on. Beat it! Oh, come on, get out of here. Ain't you going to third degree us? [INAUDIBLE]. I want to get some sleep. Well, how do you like that? Well, my old man's going to get somebody's job for this, you know that? Mine, I suppose? Maybe. You know, he's a pretty big shot. He's got a lot to say. Yeah? Yeah. I suppose you're going to be a big shot someday too, huh? Oh, myou bet your life, boy. Just like him. Now listen, you. I've been pretty lenient with all you boys, but the next time they bring you in here I'm going to put you in a cell. You want to do it now? Keep your trap shut. Well, I guess the old man put in a fix already. Come on, let's go. Nice to have been with you. A tough lot, that. No they're not. Poor little devils born without a chance. They're all trying be hard and tough because they figure that's the best way to get along in this world. The tough guy puts it over on the guy that ain't so tough. And makes more work for the Police Department. What else and you expect? Say, I was born in this district myself. I liked the uniform, so I became a cop. But I could just as easily have gone the other way and been a crook. I guess that's right. MARY: Now where are you sneaking to? Sneaking? What kind of talk is that? Where's my briefcase? What do you want it for? I have a business appointment. Brennan, you've never had anything but business appointments all your life, and no business. Never a cent have you brought into this house in ten years. I don't care for you myself. It's Chuck I'm thinking of. Sometimes, Brennan, I think I'm a fool that I haven't told him the truth about you. And what's that? That you're no good. That you've never amounted to anything and you never will. But I haven't, so he thinks you're great... a man of great affairs. He's trying to grow up to be like you. [INAUDIBLE] You're his model, and he wants to be like his old man. Don't you shush me! I know what I'm doing. Heaven help him. It's happening. He is growing up to be like you... another no good. Perhaps I should have told the lad before it's too late. Now, do I get my briefcase or don't I? Well then get me a cup of coffee. A man has got to have something to occupy his mind. Sitting around here wasting a... a half a day. That should worry you. You've wasted 365 whole days every year ever since I knew you. Look Mary, I, uh... I didn't want to worry you, but I had a feeling that maybe I ought to be going and seeing what's happened to Chuck. Since when did you start worrying over Chuck? He's his father's... can do no wrong, can he? Well, I'll admit he's a fine high-spirited lad, but a bit reckless. I was going to find Rourke and ask him to keep an eye on him. Rourke never has his eye off him. Where have you been all night? In the can. Well, ain't that nice? Have you been thieving? No, I ain't been thieving? Then what did they put you into the can for? Oh, it was Halloween and we pulled a couple of gags and the cops got sore. You knew that guy Rourke's getting too smart. What did they do to you? Nothing. They didn't even give us a bath. Well that's too bad. Go wash your face. What did I tell you? He's getting to be the spitting image of you. Well I was never in the can. That's a pity. Don't dry your hands on the dish towel. What you got to eat. Oh, I kept these warm for you. Don't know why. Hey, don't eat so fast. Why are you picking on me? Well, for a lot of reasons. For one thing, you got your mother all upset... spending the night in the can like a common hoodlum. Hey how long is it since you quit school? Two years. Then you ought to be looking for a job. A job? I figured it'd be a good idea. Well Pop, only saps work. You told me that yourself. Well yes, but, uh... Well all right, am I like you or am I not? I've got my own gang. I make them stand around just like you make everybody stand around in the district. Well, yeah... Do you work? Does Oldham work? No, you use your friends. So, you get some place. Look where you are now. Maybe you'll be Oldham's boss, get to be supervisor. Maybe you'll get to be mayor. Who knows. Now there's a lot of truth in what you're saying. But if there's a fight, then I... I have nothing more to say. What fight? Here's some fresh cakes for you. [INAUDIBLE] why you did it. And I suppose... No I do not want any more coffee. Now Mary, do I get my briefcase? I ain't seen it. [PIANO] (SINGING) Did your mother come from Ireland? 'Cause there's something in you Irish. Will you tell me where you get those Irish eyes? And before she left Killarney, did your mother kiss the blarney? 'Cause your little touch of brogue you can't disguise. I've never seen an island or the ocean, though I've wished for the chance to breathe it. In my mind I've always had a crazy notion that I'd know a bit of Irish when I leave here. Did your mother come from Ireland? 'Cause there's something in you Irish. Will you tell me where you get those Irish eyes? And before she left Killarney, did your mother kiss the blarney? 'Cause your little touch of brogue you can't disguise. Oh, I wouldn't be romancin'. I can almost see you dancin' where the Kerry pipers play. Sure and maybe we'll be sharin' in the shamrock you'll be wearin' on the next St. Patrick's Day. Did your mother come from Ireland? 'Cause there something in you Irish, and that bit of Irish steals my heart away. [INAUDIBLE], it was lovely. Thank you. Where is your mother? Where's my patient? Not this beautiful person! You're worse than Nora. There's more sugar in your speech than there is in the medicine you gave me. [LAUGHING] How do you feel? I feel fine, doctor. Honestly. It's sheer tom-foolery for me to be going way. Now, now... I think it's for the best. We'll have no more arguments. Uh, Nora, is this fresh water? Yes, it is. [HONKING] MAN: Cut that out! Well Julie, there it is. I can think of a lot of things Uncle could have left me that I'd much rather have than this. Well don't laugh at it. It brings in $500 a month. Takes more than that to fix it up. Fix it up? You don't think I'm going to leave it this way, do you? Julie, why don't you let us handle this. We'll take care of it. You've been taking care of it. Where are you going? I'm going to inspect my property. Please send the car back. [SNORING] [KNOCKING] May I come in and look at your apartment? I'm the new owner. You're not going to raise the rent, are you? Of course not. There you are, dear. You run and get your mother ready. The ambulance will be here any second. Will you excuse her, please? Her mother's very ill and we're sending her away. I'd like to talk to you. Will you wait, please? Why, yes. Thank you. [SIREN] There's the ambulance. The poor little darling... they're taking her mother away. Whose mother? Nora's. The doctor told me they might take her away today. Did I understand you to say that you own this property? Yes. I've always wanted to meet the kind of person who owned a tenement like this, who lived on the poverty and misery of the people of the slums. I beg your pardon? Miss Fifth Avenue... or is it Miss Riverside Drive? Bleeding to death the poor devils who live here. How dare you? How dare I? I have to look after these people, to try and save their wretched, miserable lives. This lady here, I'm sending her away so she may have a chance to live. I don't always get them in time. Last week there was one downstairs. It was too late. Why... They pay $12 a month, you know... the price of two [INAUDIBLE]. But this filthy hole has given her tuberculosis, just the same as every apartment you own that provides you income is breeding disease in the family of every poor devil who has to live here. I hope you enjoy the $4 a month. Bring that in here, please. [COMMOTION] Hey, you kids. Come on, scram! [INTERPOSING VOICES] Come on! All right, you heard him. I'll bet it cost $1,000. I'll bet you it cost $5,000. That thing? Sure, you trying to tell me... Look... Tony. Ah, ain't he got his nerve? Don't let on we see them until after the ambulance goes. Come on. [SIREN] Keep that chin up, baby. Be a good soldier. That's it. I'll be back an see you in a little while. [CRYING] Hey, hey... come on, now. Remember what the doctor said... you got to keep your chin up. [MOCK CRYING] Go on... go in the house. Go on. Brennan, it's Chuck. They're fighting. Go down there and stop him. Why should I? Chuck is winning, ain't he? Oh, you got clipped, eh? Yeah, I guess I did. Maybe you'd better go over and let the doctor look at it. Come on, I'll take you. CHUCK: Come here. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute! Listen, Chuck. If I catch you fighting again I'm going to run you in. Now what have you got there? Ah, nothing. You'd better go and see the Doc. Oh, I don't need to see no doctor. Mind what I'm telling you. Go on over and see the doctor. [MUMBLING] [COMMOTION] Hello Nora. Is the doctor in? He's in a surgery. You wait right in here. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Hi, Doc. Hello Chuck. Well, this is a surprise. You. I didn't know... So Miss Park Avenue landed in the slums. Right on her face. Just a moment. Sit down, please. This is an emergency hospital and I insist you remain for treatment. What's the matter with you, Chuck? Oh, somebody clonked me over the head with a [INAUDIBLE]. I think I cracked my mitt here too. Oh, that mitt's all right. Well, they couldn't [INAUDIBLE] that bell with an axe. [LAUGHING] Take Chuck in the dressing room and clean that up. All right. That's one or chief products here in this district... black eyes. We turn them out wholesale. So you came down to see how the other half live? Are you starting again? Haven't you said everything you possibly could? I only inherited that property this morning. It was wished on me. I don't like it any better than you do. And I intend to spend all the money in brings in fixing it up, providing I get some help instead of abuse. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't understand. Why didn't you tell me? You didn't give me a chance. Now, now... I can't fix that eye with those tears coming out. Now you cheer up. I'm going to do everything I can to help you. Say "ah." Put those instruments down. Here we are. This will take care of it. Let go of my hand. Does it hurt? No, it tickles. Scoot. Well, I'll be seeing you. I'm afraid so. OK, Doc... send the bill to my lawyer. All right, Chuck. Aha! That's a [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHING] Good bye. Good bye Nora. I'll be over and see you later. She's sweet. But those boys... are they all like that? Most of them. What happens to them? Oh, some of them come through, but the majority of the crack up. It'll take more than paint and varnish to help them. Well, if we saved one in 1,000 it would be worthwhile, wouldn't it? Yes, I guess it would. I'll make a deal with you. I'll continue to patch up their bodies, and you see what you can do for them monthly. Partners? Partners. Goodbye. Goodbye. You're the most stupid man I ever saw. All right, all right. But now Mary, do I get my briefcase? Go ask Tim Farley where it is. He brought you home last night. Oh, so that's it? I ain't even seen that low-down, back breaking, double crossing piece of varmint... let alone speak to him. Then you weren't out with him last night. Never fear. I was [INAUDIBLE]... the boss of the district... discussing a big deal that will end our worries for the rest of our days if I pull it over. I suppose you found somebody to finance the [INAUDIBLE] tunnel under the Atlantic. Now Mary, I've been trying to tell you about it all morning. Now this is something more in my line as an organizer. I'm forming a union of the [INAUDIBLE], that will give me an income of $1,000 a week. Hm, you expect me to look forward to that? [KNOCKING] Come in. Well, how are you all this bright and shiny morning? I just come back to return your briefcase to you. There's your briefcase, Brennan. What did I tell you? Sure, I took the liberty of keeping it because it contains the papers for the organization of the big new [INAUDIBLE] Union. That's why I was just asking about it. Pull up a chair and have a bite to eat. Eh, no thanks. I've had me breakfast, but I... I would have a small cup of coffee. Well Mary, heat up the coffee for him. [INAUDIBLE]. And then, uh, bring him a cup so that he can drink it. Are you sure you're not hungry? No, I... to tell the truth, I'm not hungry. But I'll nibble on these while I"m waiting for me coffee. Hey Spike. Where were you when the fight started? I was busy. Why didn't you get in it? I just don't like to fight. Well how are you going to get anywhere if you don't learn to fight. I'll just was soon not get nowhere if I have to fight. Well look at [INAUDIBLE] and Johnson. Look at Lewis. Most of them was born big. I was born little. Well you better get in it next time or you're not going to be in the club. How is your head this morning? Terrible! Oh, now Mary, really. I... I've had a sufficiency. But, well, of course I don't want to offend you. Tell Mary about our plans for organizing the [INAUDIBLE]. Our plans? Oh, Foggy, you're the modest one. I only wish they were my plans. Mary has a [INAUDIBLE]. I was figuring out yesterday that the average week would let us $1,000. That is a reasonable approximation. What do you give the men for their money? BRENNAN AND FOGGY: The right to buy them. The right to buy them what? Nora! Well, Nora my darling. Now ain't it fine that you momma's going to have fresh eggs, and milk, and fresh air every day, huh? Oh, that's right, they took her to the sanitarium today, didn't they? Well, I never had no faith in sanitariums. Ah, you'd rather be using your mouth eating other people's [INAUDIBLE]. Aha! Been fighting in the streets again, huh? Is your head all right, Chuck? Yes. What happened to your head? Oh, Tony cracked me with a bottle when I wasn't looking. Don't ever let me hear of you fighting with bottles. I don't need to fight with bottles. I can like that [INAUDIBLE] with one hand. Well, all right, but don't forget what I've always taught you. And don't forget your father was a three time champion. Yeah, I know. Hey Ma, what happened to my breakfast? Ask your father's bosom companion, here? If he'd get up enough to make a place for Nora. Oh no, I have some things in the apartment I can [INAUDIBLE]. Here Nora... here. Let her sit here. Say, why don't you live her all the time? Ah, why not? Oh... oh, no, I couldn't do that. You couldn't afford it. Who couldn't? I'm on the verge of a deal that will make us all practically millionaires. So don't you be worrying about where the money is coming from. I wouldn't stay awake waiting for it, but we could get along some way, darling. You better take the chance while you have it, otherwise you'll be shoved into an orphan asylum. And believe me they make you tow the line there. You'll be up at 6 o'clock every morning, working hard all day, and the food they give you is not fit to throw out the window. An orphan asylum? Oh no! Can't you keep your mouth shut? Didn't she have a hard enough time as it is now? No, you got to open that big mouth of yours. I don't know what you have this stooge hanging around here for anyway. If the boy were mine, he wouldn't be permitted to talk to his elders in that fashion. [INAUDIBLE] Don't forget that! Mary, could I have another cup of coffee, please? [CRYING] Hey, come on, cut that out. Come on. But he said they'd take me away. Oh, they ain't going to take you no place. Don't pay any attention to that [INAUDIBLE]. Chuck, I don't want to leave here. Well you're not going to leave here. Now stop your blubbering, will you? I can't think. Say, they can't take you away if you're working. But... but I do work. I help everybody around here. No, no... I mean you got to have a steady job. You're going to sing. That's it, you're going to sing for Pete. But... but they won't allow me. I'm not of age. Well, now listen, don't think so much. You let me do the talking, and you sing. But don't sing those old-fashioned songs... you got to sing something new now. Torch songs... that's it. You know... torch songs? Do you got a dime? Mm-hm. Come on, I'll buy you a song. What's the matter? I'm scared. What you got to be scared about? You got nothing to lose. Come on. Hi. Hi. Want you make yourself some money? I... Got a deal for you right here... great little singer. Oh, she's too... What do you mean? Look at her. She's 18 years old, got her working papers and everything. You want to hear her? Go get your piano player. Go on. [INAUDIBLE] Fred, play the girl's music, will you? Have a cigar? Thanks. [PIANO] [MUSIC - BILLIE HOLIDAY, "CARELESSLY"] [CLAPPING] CHUCK: Oh, that was swell. That was swell. Well, what do you say? Well, I'll give her $10 a week. $10 a week for our services? What have you got to do with it? I'm her manager... 10%. $10 or nothing. Make it $15... well, we'll take that. Give her that other song there and let her learn it. And come back here at 7 o'clock, and I'll have a dress for you. Gee, thanks! You're not making any mistake. Say, if you're going to be a businessman, don't pass out anymore ropes like that. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC - BRYAN FERRY, "THESE FOOLISH THINGS"] [APPLAUSE] There she is. Nora, who fixed you up in this get-up. What's the matter, Rourke? You know what's the matter. This girl said she was 18. You're lying, Pete. If you ever try to pull this again I'll shut up this joint so tight you won't be able to get in or out. I assure you ladies that she has very fine parents. They... they take excellent care of her. Well I'd like to see if her parents. Why certainly, ladies. Come right along. PETE: How about the dress? I'll see that you get it back. Hey Mom, I'm in a jam. Now what have you done? I got Nora a job down at Pete's Grotto, and police dames came in to pick her up. You got to help me. I'll do nothing of the sort. This once you're going to get out of your own jam. But Mom, it's not for me. It's on account of Nora. We got it all set with Rourke to say that you're her mother. Me lie? Now Nora, don't you be frightened. Just leave it to old Rourke. MARY: Come in! Mrs. Brennan, you'll have to talk to this daughter of yours. I picked her up singing in a cafe pretending she was 18 years old. Nora! Why, Sis! Did you send that girl out to work? I did not, and I don't fancy you for accusing me. I'm the man of the house here. You'll do your talking to me. I'll send an investigator down here first thing in the morning to talk to you. And I'll do all in my power to assist you, ma'am. Oh, hey little Nora, darling. And what do you hear from your mother? She just heard plenty. You should have heard what Ma was telling sister... Good night, ladies. Good night. What are you trying to do, spoil everything? Let me see, I got... Those were policewomen. We were just trying of convince them that Ma is Nora's mother. Well, my fine feathered friend, you got us in a fine mess, didn't you? Yeah, well I took your tip and got you out of it, too. We're not out of it yet. If those two old busy-bodies had run into any other officer but me this poor girl would be down in the juvenile home right now. That's a good place for her... three meals a today and a good education. Stop your gab, Farley. Well, I'll drop around in the morning and see what I can do. Good night to you all. Good night. [NORA CRYING] The poor little thing. And whatever have they been putting on you? I suppose this is your idea, too, you good for nothing! Who put that into your head? I suppose you think that's using your brain. Oh... Oh lay off, will you? If that boy were mine I'd [INAUDIBLE] as punishment. [INAUDIBLE]. Well, I want no part of him. Well he's mine, and you... Sit down and let's play a game of cribbage. All right. Cut for deal. I have some bad news for you, too. Fellow told me a while back that, uh... that we're going to replace all the soda clerks with machines to mix all the drinks. Oh. That's bad. We'll organize the men that make the machines. Foggy, [INAUDIBLE]. Nothing can stop you. Please, please. Look, you're going to give that stove to Mrs. Jones? Yes, I was going to. Well, can I have the green paper? Yes, yes of course. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Say, what's going on here. Look... wait a minute, please. Look, Miss Stone is trying to make the place livable. Now all of you clear out and let her go to work. We're going to fix all the apartments up nice. Go ahead... you too, Kelly. Hurry up. [LAUGHING] You laugh at me, I'll scream! Discouraged? Who wouldn't be? What do they want? They don't know. They've never had anything. But don't give up. Remember, we're partners. Hello Doc. Hello Rourke. Oh, Miss Stone, this is Officer Rourke. He's on the night beat here. How are you doing, Miss Stone? I've heard a lot about you from the Doc. He's been telling me what you're going to do in the tenements. They sure need it. How's Nora? I haven't seen her yet. Anything wrong? Two women were here from the Children's Aid Society. They're going to take her away. Can they do that? I'm afraid so. This is something I can do. [INAUDIBLE] I'll go with you. [INAUDIBLE]. It's Chuck's fault. [KNOCKING] Good morning Mrs. Brennan. This is Miss Stone, your new landlady. Yes, I know. How do you do? Mrs. Brennan, we want to see Nora. Now you're not going to take that child away. I'll get the papers, and I'm going to be her guardian myself. I've thought of something better than that. I'd like to send her to private school. Would you? Oh Nora? Come out. It's all right, and wait 'til you hear this. Have they been trying to frighten you. Listen Nora... when I was a little girl I went to a very nice school. I'd like to send you there. You'd have a lovely room all to yourself. Or, if you'd like company, you can live with another girl. And you can have singing lessons, and dancing lessons, or anything you'd like to learn. Would you like to go there? Oh, Miss Stone I... I'd love it, but... but I couldn't let you do it. What's the matter with this place? She don't need singing lessons. She needs singing lessons, I'll get her a teacher. Quiet, you! I think that's for Nora to decide. I'm sure you'll be happy there, dear. And then when your mother's well you two can be together again. Well, aren't you the lucky one. I think heaven must have sent Miss Stone down here to us. Oh, bless her. Would you like to go now? Oh, yes! Well, get your things. My car's outside. Nora, you're going away. [LAUGHING] Come here to me! I don't suppose you'll talk to us when you get back. Well, that's that. I sent in my report to the department. It'll be all clear with the general authorities, and everybody will be satisfied. What's there to be satisfied about, huh? You sure messed things up good, didn't you cop? That'll be enough out of you. Yeah, ain't you the hero, huh? Take a girl away from the place where she's born and raised and knows everybody, and turn her over to a woman who sends her to some school where she don't know anybody at all. Chuck, don't be disrespectful! Well how you going to honor your respect for a woman who's so dumb she buys people a lot of lamps, and rugs, and bathtubs that they don't even want. They'll hock the lamps and put garbage in the bathtub. I'll keep that in mind. Yeah, you keep something mind. I thought you were dumb, but she's dumber. Nice quiet little lad. Don't worry about him, Mrs. Brennan. He's only suffering from growing pains. Miss Park Avenue, I think you're swell. Thanks. Hey, not so rough, Spike. I'm not rough, I'm just feeling good. That's all. Who's been smoking? Nobody. Come on, who's been smoking? I only took a puff. Well cut it out. Can't keep in condition with smoke. You know that. I know what's eating you. They took Nora away. They never took Nora no place! Heck, they didn't. [INAUDIBLE] last night, and this morning they sent her away. I tell you, they didn't send her any place. She went to a swell dump... same school as the lady that owns the apartment. I fixed that. Oh. Hey you know, that lady's OK, ain't she? She's going to get my mom a new rug. Maybe we can cop it. Not a chance. The old man's already figured on hocking it. I got a great idea. Maybe we could get her to fixing up this joint. Sure, we can hock the stuff and tell her somebody broke in and stole it. Oh, grow up, will you? Grow up. Don't be small timers. Well, she pays cash for everything, don't she? You mean, she carries a back roll? Now what do you think? We could cop it, huh? What do we do? Do we draw straws? Don't pick me. Please don't pick me. My old man's a thief... a lowdown loser. He's in the big house, and I'm scared. Ah, you're yellow. Your old man's a crook, then you're a crook too. You was born into it and you can't get away from it. Oh, let him alone fellows. Go on, Spike, you better go. You're too little. Must I go? You heard what I said, Spike. Now go on, beat it. I could give you rub downs. Yeah, yeah... OK, Spike. But go on, we're busy now. Go. Bolt the door after him. Well, I guess you're right. We better draw straws. Get the broom, huh? [BREAKING GLASS] How do we get you rats out, with cheese? Say, Luigi wrote that. He's the only one who can spell that good. There asking for it. Go see where they are. Hey there they are across the street. Tell him I'm over here with six guys. He can bring 10. OK, Chuck. Give me that. Well boys, you know what to do. If they accept the challenge, wipe the place up with them. Chuck's waiting for you. There's seven of us, but you can bring 10. You'll need them. Yeah? We'll bring seven. OK. So, I told the guys and they said they'd only bring seven. Oh, making it easy on us, uh? Get set, fellows. You didn't think we had enough nerve to walk in, did you? You walked in, but you're going to be carried out. That so? Yeah, I ain't going to give you a chance to part my hair with a bottle this time. Who did? You did, you fink. You're nothing but a two bit guy. You're the kind of a guy that stools to the coppers. And if you can't find a copper you'd stool to another guy. Yeah? Well I don't try to make money of a girl that sings. Oh, you're the guy that stooled to them women reformers, huh? Chuck! Chuck, look out! [SCREECHING TIRES] [SCREAMING] What time is the funeral, Chuck? 3 o'clock. All you guys be there, too. I wish I hadn't have said Spike was yellow. Well, you talk too much. Remember all the rubdowns he gave us on this table? Oh shut up, will you? Hey we forgot the flowers. We got to get some flowers. Where will we get them? Well where do we always get them? Go on... go get some flowers. Hurry up. Is Nora going to sing? I don't know. I told the Doc to get her. Do you think she'll come? How would I know? Maria... for the little colored boy. Spike? Si... poor little bambino. Here. Put them on the sidewalk. Why? So the boys can steal them. You see, Maria? Now they are happy. [MUSIC - "SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT"] Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Put that chair down. It's just been painted. All the changes [INAUDIBLE] having everything nice and clean. You never will amount to anything. If it hadn't been for you the colored boy would be alive today. If wasn't for your fighting he wouldn't be in the way of a truck. You are the one that's responsible for his death. He was one of your boys, wasn't he? The boys that you're teaching to lie, and to steal, and to fight. Spike was a good boy... laid down his life for a friend, finest thing a man could do. You wouldn't understand. If you keep on, you'll be taking lives. And if you don't go to work you'll end up in the big house. All right, I'll go to work. I'll go down and see if Oldham needs another leader. Hey, where are you going? I'm going in to see Mr. Oldham. I've waited long enough here. Oldham can't be bothered seeing you, Brennan. Now I've told you that every day. BRENNAN: But this is very important. CLERK: Now listen, why don't you get [INAUDIBLE] for yourself, and get a job, and quit hanging around here. Now you get out of here before I throw you out. Where's that estimate? Good morning, Mr. Oldham. Oh, go get me a couple cigars. The same kind I got yesterday? Yes. Yes, all right. And I won't be minute Mr. Oldham. I... What do you do to join up? You want to join the Navy and see the world? No, I just want to get out of town. What's your name? Chuck Brennan. How old are you? 16, almost 17. You're almost too young to join the Navy. When's your birthday? 10th of November. All right, well I'm afraid you'll have to come back then. What do you mean? We can't take enlistments under 17. How do you like that? Tell a guy the truth and he turns you down. Now, I could have just as well have said I was 17, and you wouldn't have known the difference. Oh, I think we could've found out. If you really want to be a Navy man, though, come back on your birthday and bring your parents' consent. I'm sorry. Oh, forget it. Where you been? Oh, I've been around. Come on, let's go shoot some pool. Set 'em up. This the joint? Yeah. Say, you know who that is? That's Blackie Davis. I seen his picture in the paper. You know, the big gambler. This is terrible. We'll need some more paint in the joint, some more bright lights. We'll stick some slot machines over there, and put a nice little cocktail bar right over there. That's swell. It'll give the joint a little class. Yeah, that ought to do it. Play a little pool, gents. He's Blackie Davis. And I'm taking over this part of the town. You've got a partner, fellow. Partner? I don't need a partner. You heard what he said. You got a partner. I've run this place successfully for 20 years, and I'm not interested. And you're still going to run if you're a nice boy. Be smart, McArthur. Make yourself some dough. What's your name, kid? Chuck Brennan. Right boy, you keep your ears wide open, don't you? I just heard you say you're taking over this part of town. That's right. Well then you want to talk to me, because anything worth knowing around here I know. That's swell. What do you say you and I take a little walk and you show me around? Sure thing. OK, pally. Hello Rusty. Hello Blackie. How are you? Fine. Chuck, I want you to meet Mrs. Davis. How do you do? Hello. Chuck, well you go inside and wait for me there, will you? Sure. That a boy. Where did you pick that up? I'm taking over the lower downtown, and that kid's going to come in handy. Yeah, he looks it. You're taking him right out of cradle, aren't you? Listen, that kid's the boss of a bunch of tough young monkeys downtown. He's going to be very, very valuable. If find anything you can use, you use it don't you. That's me, baby. Even if you destroy it? What's the matter with you? Have you been reading too much? Oh Blackie, no. Sit down. So you want to make yourself a little money? Sure. Well, then we'll let you in. What do I do? What do you think we were doing over at McArthur's. Well, I figured you were financing to make him a little dough. That's right. That's what we are... financiers. You know, some people are dumb. We supply the brains. Got the laundry business, cleaning and dining business, and other little businesses. You see, some people they make too much dough, and they forget to pay off. That's where we come in. We go out to collect. Oh, collect? That's right. Sure. I'll tell you more about it later. Here, go out and get yourself some clothes. Gee, thanks. Thanks a lot. It's all right. Wait a minute. What about the loose lip? Buttoned up. That a baby. Aren't they beautiful? My mother had china like that. What's the matter Brennan? Worrying about your millions? What's the matter? You ain't got no fever. Your head's as cool as ice. Been drinking more than usual today, Brennan? No. Chuck come down to the office this morning? We he supposed to? He said he was going to. He wanted to see if Oldham wanted any more leaders. [KNOCKING] If that's that loafer Farley I won't let him come in here and muss things up. Ah! Hello Mrs. Brennan. How are you? Oh, how nice your place looks. Come on in. Hi ya. Oh, Nora! Well, glory be. Come here, darling. How pretty you look. For you. For me? Why, I ain't had nothing happen to me like this for years. Sit down here, Miss Stone. Thank you. And Doc, try out that chair. It has every comfort except the rockers. Oh here, Nora. Now you sit down here. I know who you're looking for. But don't worry, he'll be here any minute now. Well, we have ham and cabbage, and plenty of it. Haven't we? Oh sure, now you're all going to stay for dinner. All right. Well, hi there. Hello Nora. Hello, hi ya Doc. DOC: Hello Chuck. Hello Ma. Hi Pop. Hello son. Where you get the new suit? Oh, you like it, huh? Oh, I'm in a swell set-up. [INAUDIBLE]. Well where did you get it? Blackie Davis bought it for me. Say that again. Blackie Davis. MARY: Who's that? He's one of the dirtiest crooks in New York. What do you mean, crook. He's... I'm in business with him. You're what? Sure, he's a financier. He finances dumbbells and shows them how to make a lot of dough. Take off them clothes. Do as I say or get out of here and never let me see your face again. Pop, don't talk to me like that in front off people. I'm through talking. Take them off or I'll tear them off! Wait a minute, Brennan. You're going about this in the wrong way. Why should I? After what I say today? What do you want me to do, grow up to be a stooge like you? OK, I can take it. Don't worry, Mom. I'll send you lots of dough. What about that Acme crowd. They won't pay off. I had to take the manager's on three times today. He should have to take care of them himself. [BUZZER] Hey, you do look different. You like it, huh. It look like Blackie's? Yes, [INAUDIBLE]. Sit down. Have... have you a mother and a father? Why sure. Well, go home. Don't hang around Blackie. Well what's the matter? Well, the truth... I'm going to tell you. BLACKIE: That you Chuck? Just a minute. Yeah. How do you like it, huh? Well, that's the [INAUDIBLE]. Now you belong. Oh here. What's that for? That's the change. Oh, you keep that Chuck. You're one of my boys now. Ah, thanks. Chuck, what do you know about the warehouse of the Acme Dry Cleaning Company? Down in the old neighborhood? That's right. Well we kids used to bust in there on hot nights and go swimming in the tank. You mean, go in and out any time you like? Sure, through the skylight in the roof. Boys, do I pick them or do I pick them? What do you want to know for? Well, you know, Chuck. Uh, we have a little bill to collect... a little surprise party, you know? Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. Like that, aren't we? Sure. OK. Tonight. [ALARM] Stop! Don't shoot, it's Rourke! What's the matter with you? [INAUDIBLE]. Get in there! It's Rourke! [INAUDIBLE] It's the kid! How is he? He's all right? Did you ever see him with a rod, Foggy? Never. You ain't figuring he shot Rourke? Well, it's a puzzle. You his father? Then get in there and make him talk. If he's innocent, every minute he's letting a guilty man get away. He won't talk to me. He has no use for me. Why? When he found out I was a kind of a stooge, without any regularly employment, he lost all respect for me. Come on. Come clean! You better talk, kid. You want to protect a guy that shoots a policeman in the back and then plugs you? You'll never get anywhere acting this way, kid. How's the kid? They're getting him on the grill now. What for? I told them he was trying to protect me. He ran to me when I was down and they got him... the rats. What more do they want? The kid won't talk, and they're trying to find out who did the shooting, Rourke. [INAUDIBLE] boy. If Rourke dies, you'll go to the chair. You know that don't you? How's Rourke? Pretty bad. Is he dying? OFFICER: I'm afraid so. Take me to him, will you? I want to see him. OFFICER: Will you talk? Take me to him, will you please? All right, boys. Take him in. Get a hold of that lower sheet. Yeah, come on, give us a lift there. All right, lift. There you are. Hello, Rourke. Hello, Chuck. Who got me? Blackie Davies... he had a .38 Automatic. ROURKE: Where does he hang out? CHUCK: Grand Apartments. Blackie Davis... Grand Apartments. Pick him up. Come on boys. Their yellow, Rourke. They don't fight fair. They use guns. Chuck, they used you for a stooge. Yeah. I called my old man a stooge. He never did anything wrong in his life. Well, he never worked, but he was always on the square. Why did you run to me? I saw you were down. They kept shooting at you. [INAUDIBLE]? You always gave him a chance. Was, Chuck. Little [INAUDIBLE] is dead. [MUSIC PLAYING] Goodbye Chuck. Goodbye Pop. Goodbye Ma. You look nice, Chuck. Yeah, it's pretty slick, isn't it? How long do you think you'll be gone? Oh, I don't know. Four years, maybe. Gee, Chuck, I... I'm going to miss you a lot. I'll miss you too, Nora. VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] on Float 5. Oh, I guess that's me. Well, good bye. Good bye. Well, I got to be going. Yeah, I guess you do. You won't forget me, will you, Chuck. No. VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] on Float 5. Oh, I guess that's me. Oh! Good bye, Chuck. [MUSIC PLAYING]
