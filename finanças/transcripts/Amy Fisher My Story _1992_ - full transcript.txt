This is Amy Fisher's story, her version of the truth. She says she had a partner in crime. The man she claims was her lover, Joey Buttafuoco. He has consistently denied any sexual involvement with her and any knowledge of the criminal activities you will see portrayed in this film. Only they know what really happened. (soft music) (bubbles popping) (soft music) (alarm beeps) (soft music) (keys tapping) Joey. Yeah, I heard. They saying the mafia did it. Just talk? Nothing else? I'd better not. I love you too. (foot steps) Going for a run. (door bangs) (engine revs) (radio plays) (siren screeching) (tires screech) Freeze. Put your hands on the wheel. Why, what did I do? Get em on the wheel. What did I do? Get out of the car, now! Down on your knees and cross your feet. Ouch, Cross your feet. What did I do? Dear Paul, I'm making this tape so you won't forget me. So you'll know I'm thinking about you. Do you think about me? I hope so. My lawyer says I shouldn't communicate with anybody, but he doesn't understand how I feel. You're the only one I could trust, even Joey betrayed me. You're probably laughing. Maybe I should have expected it, but I didn't, not that he'd lie about everything. So now I'm locked up and I can't even call anybody 'cause somebody might be listening. And there's like a $2 million bail, so I'll never get outta here. Paul, you're the only one who understands. You're the only one who'll believe me when I say, I still don't know what happened. I mean, I know what I did, but I just don't understand how it all began. Was it my father, what he did to me? He says he's sorry now. Poor, pathetic fool that he is. Or my mother who never stopped him. Or did it start with Joey? Give me a million dollars, I couldn't tell you where the damage was. Very good work. I told the princesses if she needs anything else done to her car, this is the place. Amy, this is Mr. Buttafuoco. Hi. Joey. If you need anything, just bring the car to him. You need this. Anything. Thank you. Indeed, thank you. Good to see you again. Let me get that for you. (door slams) (engine revs) He was very polite, a real gentleman. Did you see that? Jail bait. I didn't even see him again for, must've been months. (bell ringing) It's gonna be a great play (indistinct). I wasn't invited. Come on, Amy, nobody's invited, not really. You just show up. Amy. I gotta go. With them? Yeah. Crystal and Ellen don't even go to school here. Not anymore. So? Where you going? I'll take you. You can't, it's girl's stuff, first the braces, now the hair He looks happy. He wants me to go to Toll bay. There's a million guys there on the beach, on the dock. Oh, boring. I'd rather be in Brooklyn. (doors slam) With guys that are old enough to know what to do in the dark. (engine roars) No, Roseanne, you tell me, you two are the big buddy buddies here. Explain that. Elliot, it's only hair. Purple hair? It's just a hair extension. This is her future we're talking about here. Her educational future. What does my hair have to do with school? You're not concentrating. I go every day, my grades all right. Amy. You look like a slut. Elliot, stop it. Can I go now? May I go? Whatever, mom? (chair scrapes) She's spoiled. She's young. She's too young. For what? Are you blind, the way she dresses, her hair. She's willful, spoiled. And who bought her the dog and the car? I did and that's fine. But I expect her to hold up her end, work, study. If you... You're supposed to be her mother, not her sister or her friend. She works at the mall. She goes to class. She'll pass. She'll be all right. I'm just afraid she'll take off again. And you're not. No, I'm telling you Crystal. No, he just went crazy. He's like that. No, I can't (chuckles). I guess I'm gonna go. (door handle creaks) (soft music) (door closes) (soft music) Paul, before you, there was only one person I could talk to, really talk who wouldn't betray my confidence. My aunt Violet. She's younger than my mom. A lot younger. And she listened. I'm telling you I can't stay there anymore. Amy, can't you just... I can't. I mean, you know what he's like, and her, that's why you haven't talked to them for 13 years. Yeah. It's everything. I mean, everything, work, school. Who I see, where I go and now my hair, I mean, he talks to me like I'm a kid, like he still thinks I'm a child. What's your mom say? Nothing. You know? I mean, she tries to talk to him and she says, "She's got a life Elliot, let her live it". But he won't. And I don't know, you know, he acts like he's all concerned. And maybe he is, but it's not for me. You know it's for himself. And she just ignores it. I mean, she won't stand up to him. Not when it counts. Yeah, but you know, running away is not the answer. Yeah, but why can't I go live with gram again? Or come live with you? You're my aunt. Because gram's old and if you came here, you know the way your mom feels about me, it would never work. Amy, listen to me now, you've only got your senior year to go. I mean, you've got one more year and then you are free. And if I can make it that long? Of course you gonna make it. Oh come here kid. Okay, I want it right here, okay? Amy, only spelled A I M E E and in pink. Hot pink, like your hair? No, I like it. Really? So, how hot do you want it? As hot as you've got Are you sure you can handle it? Try me. You're the boss. So is she your boss? That's my wife, Mary Jo. Beautiful, don't you think? She's the model for magazines. No doubt about it, I got me a beautiful woman. I mean, it was all just flirting, nothing serious. He had a wife. (upbeat music) I don't feel like dancing. I do. Let's do it. Don't you wanna dance? No, I'm gonna go talk to Mick. That loser? (upbeat music) Hey. Where's Tom? I dunno. Hey, are you still at home? Yeah, I'm sick of it. I'm gonna get my own place soon. All right. Come on, lets dance. Come on. Her car is not ready yet. So I'm gonna drive her home. I'll be back in a half hour. Yeah, sure. (door bangs) (engine starts) So he took me home and that's when everything changed. Dad, Dad? Your folks working? Yeah, every day, except Sunday, unless my dad's fallen asleep and he's got a heart condition. All right, it's too bad. Boy, this place is beautiful. What's upstairs? Just bedrooms and stuff. You know, you can tell a lot about a woman by how she decorates. (stairs creaking) Hey, (chuckles) look at all this stuff. This is great. Your father's right, you are a princess, a beautiful princess. Did anybody ever tell you how beautiful you are? And not like a girl either, like a woman. You smell good too. You believe in love at first sight? I dunno, I guess. Wait, my parents are... Yeah, they're working, remember? (soft music) (keys tapping) Theresa? You are not gonna believe what just happened. (birds chirping) Hey, Joey. Good day hey fellas. Yeah, very good day. All right, way to go. See you Joe. It's fun. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Double Trouble. (engine roars) You like it? I love it. (engine roars) You wanna drive? Of course I wanna drive. Just stay away from the rocks. Which rocks? Those rocks. _ Good night sir. Ah, Mr. Buttafuoco. Alan, how are you? You've got things set up for my girlfriend here? Of course. Your usual table. Yeah. And take good care of us, okay. (soft music) Good seeing you again, sir. And I'll send your waiter over right away. Thank you. You see that guy over there? Yeah. Do you know who that is? Yeah. The mafia guy. What's his name? Shush, shush, shush. Well, you know him? Let's just say we have mutual friends. You know, this is what I live for. Romance, love, sex. You do too, I can tell. That's why we're made for each other. I never had it before. Come on. Not like this. You mean with love? That's okay you don't have to say it, I can wait. I just want you to know how I feel. (soft music) I said hang the shirt's, Fischer. Don't fold them, hang. You know how to do that? I know you have got an attitude problem. I've got, am I the one who's late all the time? Who can't follow direction? You know what? Hang em yourself. You're fired, Fisher. Yeah, like hell. I quit. Amy? Theresa, get back here. What are you gonna do when your dad finds out? Who's gonna tell him? You told him, so what happened? Nothing. I mean, nothing. He's like crazy. He's like, I never know with him, you know, I mean I put a hair extension in my hair and he goes ballistic. But I quit my job, nothing. Don't worry, princess, you'll get another one. Forget him. Wish I could. So where's the new boyfriend? Late. Who I really want to hear about is this guy, Joey. Not Joey, Joey. Sorry. Joey. Joey who? You don't know him. If he goes to JFK, I know him. He's outta high school. How far outta high school? Um, 18 years. 36? Geez. (engine running) You know, all night's just a few bucks more than four hours. Okay, Mr. Buta.. Buttafuoco. When you said go out, I didn't know you meant a deli sandwich and a motel. Hey, come on. Simple pleasures. Did you get it? What's the code? 007. That's right, we're secret agents. That was great. (passionate kissing) (soft laugh) Joey, for me? It's beautiful. Oh, I wish I could get you something. I know what you can get me. Besides that. All right, but nothing expensive. All right. Maybe just a Rolex. You're a working girl, right? Not anymore. I quit. You quit? What are you gonna do for money? I don't know. Find a job where the customers wait on me. Oh yeah. Like what? (soft chuckle) God, it felt so good to be loved. (engine humming) (dog barks) (door slams) (door opens) Did they come? Yeah. Too early. My mom was still here. (excited screech) I had to tell her they were for me, I lied. So? What, you want to get caught? Don't be jealous. Right. Of an old married guy. Amy, he's a sleaze. Won't even send the flowers to your house. Oh, yeah right. Like my dad would really love that. He's using you. Teresa, I thought you were my friend. But I am. That's why I'm trying to talk to you. I mean, what do you see in this guy anyway? He loves me. We have great sex and he fixes my car. I don't know if he's using you, Amy, but I think your friends are right. He could be. But he loves me. He says it. Amy, what's he gonna say if he wants to have sex? You're gonna tell me not to see him aren't you? Would it do any good? No. You know, this isn't some boy your own age. This is a married man. You gotta protect yourself. He's had a vasectomy. Not sexually, emotionally. And I really think you ought to talk to your... No. Amy, your mother's old fashioned, but we both know she loves you. Vi, she'll tell my dad, please. I mean, you told me that I could come to you with anything that you wouldn't tell. And I won't. It's just that from, you know what you told me, this guy sounds strange, sick. Vi, I just want you to help me figure out if he's telling the truth, just help me figure out if he loves me. Amy, it's not that simple. But it was, we have fun. He made me laugh and I felt good about myself. Even though sometimes I had my doubts. Tell me she's not beautiful? Joey, tell me she's 18. Yeah. Going on 35. Right babe? This is a woman, gentlemen. A real woman. Can she talk? Yeah, when there's someone to talk to. Ooh. And since there's nobody like that around here, wanna take a walk down to the boat? All right. (soft music) Is that all I am to you, sex? You're the one wearing the clothes. Well, no clothes. You asked me to. No, you asked me what looks good. Maybe my aunt's right? What, you're talking to your family about us? Joey, you're hurting me. What are you stupid? You want this thing to end? No. Then you keep your mouth shut. She won't tell. Hey, I say shut, you understand? Hey, I love you. And maybe you just say that so you could get what you want. Do you know, maybe I do. Seriously. Our relationship is about more than just sex. Yeah, like what? Like, I tell you about my life. What do I know about yours? (water splashing) (boat creaks) Hey, I've already told you what's important. I love you. That's more than I've heard from you. I do love you. It's just, I don't want every time we're together, to have to be sexual. All right. Well, what do you want to know? I don't know, anything. How about, about Mary Jo? She's a good woman. She's the mother of my kids. So how'd you meet her? In high school, we were high school sweethearts. We still are. Amy, she's my wife, all right? We live together, but 20 years is a long time. That's why I'm here. Just for sex? Not just for sex. Come on. You don't know how good this is, do you? So tell me, how come you picked me? Because you're beautiful and smart. Sexy and tough. Don't you know that? That's what I love about you. You're a woman who knows how to live free. That's why we're so good together, in bed and out. (soft music) Joey, Joey, Joey, we can't make love. What now? I told you, I've got this burning sensation. It's probably just a rash. Or honeymooner's disease. Elliot! (heavy breathing) (soft crying) You said you wouldn't tell. I said that we would talk together. Talk Elliot. Then she better stop lying. You do not get herpes from toilet seats. It wasn't Joey. Then why did you tell your mother that it was? Because I was scared, okay. You expect me to believe you got this disease from some boy you met once at a beach party? It's the truth. Elliot, stop it, she's gotta go to school. Fine. Go, go! I want you home when school's out. What did the police say? If it was him, it's statutory rape. You're kidding, a girl like that? I'm telling you. Never, not before me. (phone rings) I'm taking her places she's never been. Joey? Joey. All right, I'll be right there. When I think of that son of a bitch, I got a good mind to go over there and... Don't. Look, we'll deal with it tonight, okay. (engine running) (soft music) Mrs. Fisher. What are you doing here? Hey, this is not what it looks like. And you? I, I had an accident, Ma. An accident? Are you all right? Yeah, she's fine. She just threw out the undercarriage of her car, taking a shortcut. We had to tow it in here. I just called Mr. B to help me with the car. Why didn't you call us? Come on. We're going home. Look, this is a big misunderstanding. And you, you follow us. We are gonna clear this up right now! I told them it wasn't you Mr. B. Yeah. Well, you got that right. What I can't figure out is how could you lie like that, to your folks an all? Especially when I thought we're friends. I'm sorry. So you're trying to tell us that you have not been seeing Amy? See her? Yeah, sure I see her, when she brings her car in. Yeah, sometimes she hangs around and once when she was having to wait, I bought her a slice of pizza, but I swear Mr. Fisher, Mrs. Fisher, I would never do anything to abuse your trust. I mean you're valued customers. And besides, she's just a kid. 16. Yeah. You know look, I have kids on my own, so I understand what you must've been going through, but I swear, whatever Amy's been telling you, I don't know how she got her problem. Then why would she say that it was you? Ma, I told you... I would like to hear it from Mr. Buttafuoco. I really don't know. Mrs. Fisher, I guess maybe she has a crush on me or something. Is that what this is, a crush? If you knew that, why did you let her hang around? It was my mistake. It seemed harmless. It was not harmless. Well, I see that now, but at the time I had no idea. Look, no harm done, I hope. And if you want to ask me any questions, I mean, go right ahead, because I got nothing to hide. She needs to finish school. That's what I tell my kids. You gotta finish school, listen to what your folks are telling you. So if she's hanging around your shop, we'd appreciate it if you just send her on her way. Yeah, if that's what you want, you got it. No more pizza for you. Do we understand each other? Do we? Absolutely. I mean, I'd do the same thing if it was my kid. No hard feelings? One condition. You keep bringing me your business. I'm really sorry, Mr. B. Look, let's just forget about it, okay. We all get carried away sometimes. I'm even kind of flattered that a beautiful girl like you would even think about a older guy like me. Mr. Fisher, Mrs. Fisher, I will call you about the car. When will it be ready, Mr. B? How'd I do? I almost believed you myself. Yeah, We'd better cool it for a while, okay. Yeah. Just ping me. Bye, Mr. B. They're lying. Maybe, but there's nothing we can do. Not with them both denying it. Except to make sure she stays away from him. I couldn't go by the shop. My parents had me on a 10 o'clock curfew. All I could do was sneak a few calls. Weeks went by. (loud sigh) It was terrible. You are making it with a married guy? So what? (soft laugh) Pretend you're my boyfriend, all right. All right, all right. (door slams) Hey, is Mr. B around? Hey, Joey? Just wait one second. What are you crazy coming here? I had to see you. How's my car doing? Well, it was a lot of damage. Yeah. So when will it be fixed? Well, it's hard to say, I got all the paperwork in my office. Why don't we go in there? My dad said he'd buy me a new car, you know, if there's too much damage, only not a sports car, but he'll pay for it. And he'll let me make payments to him. You know, we'll talk to the adjuster, because we here at Tides Auto and Body... Who's the guy? My cover. I'd buy you a sports car. I love you. I missed you. Me too, but we gotta be careful. You gotta be smart. We meet in public. Pretend we're just friends. When will you meet me? Where? There's a Church Carnival. I'm taking my kids, but my wife won't be there. I got a better idea. (soft knocking) Amy. I just wanted to tell you that the insurance adjuster called back. Apparently they missed some damage the first time they checked the car. Your father's going to take your car shopping, but don't tell him, I told you, act surprised. All right. I will. Thanks mom. Is everything else okay? You know. Mom, it's over, all right. Can we just stop talking about it? Yeah. I'm sorry. You're right. Night, night, sleep tight. (door bangs) (soft music) So now I had a new car and all I needed was a job to pay for my half. That's when Joey suggested an escort service. He denies it. But I remember him opening up the phone book, showing me the number, telling me, "Hey, it's a nice place". My friends go there. You'd get dressed up. Go fancy places. I thought I was gonna be Cinderella. Welcome home, Mr. B. (soft music) (lion roars) Hey, hey will you make up your mind? You're driving me crazy. (control bangs) It looks good. It's yours. It really wouldn't bother you? If I? What? You know, if I? Didn't I already tell you, you have sex with your body. You make love with your mind. I don't care who you're with. As long as I know, I'm the only one you really love and you don't kiss them. Right? You know, the problem is my parents, you know, I have to lie to them again. You know what you need? Buttafuoco's rules of survival. Number one, do anything you want, but just make sure you don't get caught. Number two, never tell anybody more than they have to know. You see, life is beautiful. You just gotta, you gotta live it on the edge. I'm not the first one you've lied about to Mary Jo. Am I? Look, I don't claim to be a saint, but if you love somebody, big deal if you get a little on the side, I mean, it don't mean nothing. Hey, I'm not talking about you, okay. I'm talking about before you, because you're different. All I'm saying is that if you love me, what I'm gonna get mad if you make it with another guy? No way, it doesn't make any difference. As long as nobody gets hurt. But I do love you, Joey. I love making love only to you. Come on, who you kidding? You just love sex like me, right? Right? Yeah. I guess, But what am I to you? I mean... Hey, I already told you, you are everything. Everything. If I wasn't married and Catholic and didn't have two kids, I got to be concerned with. Hey, you listen to me. If it wasn't Mary Jo, you know who would be, don't you? Don't you? (loud knocking) Oh man. Come on honey. You know what I want. A date. That's what they told me. What is this? Your first time? Wow, come a little closer and I'll tell you what you can do for this. (soft music) People ask me, how could you do it? Now I don't know. Back then, I had to prove myself to Joey and besides I did need the money. Way to go, Terry. Hey Fisher, Terry got your job. Congratulations. Oh, not that Fisher needs one with the auto mechanic paying her bills. Not that Fisher needs minimum wage, where she could make a hundred bucks an hour Doing what? An escort service. You're a hooker? No, I'm an escort. You're trying to tell me that for a hundred bucks an hour, they don't get sex? I'm not trying to tell you anything. What do you do? I eat dinner in elegant restaurants. I drink fine wine. And I enjoy intelligent conversation with mature men, which you obviously know nothing about. (sarcastic laughter) Amy? Amy, are you crazy? Who cares? (door slams) How do these guys pay for sex with credit cards? Well, I fill out the receipt, like they buying flowers. I turn it in and I pick up my cut. You, there you go. Thank you. All right. So where's Joey when you doing it with guys for money? I don't do it with Joey. We make love. Excuse me. Look, whatever you doing, I just hope you're bagging them. What do you think I am, crazy? Everyone has a condom on. Except Joey. Yeah, and what if they don't want to? Most of them are old, you know? And they just want to talk. Maybe, you know, look, hold hands. And if they don't want to? Look, I'm in control. I mean, they just lie down and they never touch me. God, don't I wish that was true. I thought a shower would just wash it all away. I mean, what was the big deal? Joey didn't care. Even liked to hear about it. And didn't Joey love me? It had to be okay. (engine running) You wanna tell me what we're doing here? Proving he's a liar. Who, Joey? Yeah. You see, see that's her car. The Jeep. The Cadillac's his. And the bikes? Must be his kids. His kids? Yeah. We'll bond, you know. It'll be like me and my aunt, you know, like sisters. I mean the boy will be harder. But it'll be all right, you know, he's already bonded with Joey. Oh, there she is, see her? I saw a woman. Was she prettier than me? What? C'mon, you saw her, is she prettier than me? I don't know. I couldn't see that well. Can't wait until she's out of the way. Why doesn't he just get a divorce? He can't, you know, I mean, he's like Catholic, right? Plus I mean, she's the mother of his kids. You could always kidnap her or something. Yeah. Like hold her for ransom, Joey. Make her pay with Joey. Yeah, but she'd still be around. Not if you like drowned her. She washes out to sea. Shot, Tina. No, no, no drown her in acid. All right. She just disappears. Nitric acid. No way. Sulfuric acid, what the hell. Oh, it will never work. Yeah. Well, you know, you got to do something, because it sounds to me like his playing with you. Yeah, tell me about it. You would think maybe it's time you took some control. Maybe she's the one you love. And I'm just your piece on the side. C'mon, what you talking about? Talking about you and me. Yeah. And here we are. Yeah. Now, but what about in a month? Or a year? Amy, I already told you, it's you that I love, right. When are you gonna get that through your thick head? It's you! God forbid anything should happen to Mary Jo. Oh, God forbid. What's that supposed to mean? It means, it means Joey, if you're serious, if you mean what you say, then get a divorce. Or what? Or it's over. You giving me an ultimatum? Fine! Fine, Joey, what do you mean? Where you going? Joey, I'm sorry. Hey, hey, it's no big deal. I got to spend some time with the family anyway, you know, Thanksgiving, Christmas. You know how it is, right? I'll see you around. (dramatic music) (soft knocking) Amy? I'm not hungry. Amy, honey, what's wrong? Can't you tell me anything? What if there was a girl who was in love with an older man and he said he loved her too. And then one day he just dumped her. We just talking hypothetically here, right? I'd say that the girl was probably lucky to be out of that relationship, but that it probably wouldn't feel that way. What it would feel like is her heart's been broken. (somber music) Forget him. How? Yeah. How? I mean, he might be a jerk but you love him, right? You gotta be strong. You can't call him. You gotta make him come to you. He's going back to his wife, is what he's doing. And you don't stand a chance. Wait a minute, I got an idea. Amy, this is crazy. Well, you know what Joey always says, you got to live on the edge. (birds chirping) (gate creaks) (bell chimes) (birds chirping) Hi, can I help you? Yeah, I'm from Massapequa High School. I'm a selling these candies for fundraising, you know, for charity. It's just a dollar. I don't know. You know, the kids still have plenty left over from Halloween. Yeah, but it's really important. You know, I got a quota to sell. It's for a really good cause. One then, okay. Hey, Hey. You're welcome. (gate slams) I can't believe you did that. What'd she say? Who cares. She's old. She's out of shape. I'm prettier. I got a better body. If he wants to be with her, he can have her. ♪ Misery stay away from me ♪ ♪ You big fat slob ♪ ♪ You are history ♪ (laughs jovially) Joey didn't call or beep, but I was strong. I didn't call him. I pretended everything was great. And after a while I didn't have to pretend. My mom and I were going shopping. Cause we were going on this great vacation on Christmas and I was gonna have fun. And you know something, I did. I really did. And then when we got back, my mom and I spent time together doing my applications for college in the fall. And by the time school started again, I'd almost forgotten about Joe. Almost. Yeah. So they got dorms there where I could live. Yeah, right, away from home. But I can still come back on weekends and visit everybody. (pager beeping) Wait a minute Theresa, my beeper is going off. No, nobody's been beeping me since I broke up with Joey. I don't even know where it is. Oh, hold on. (pager beeping) Theresa, can I call you back? Yeah. It's 007. No, no, it's over. I just want to hear him whine. (door slams) (engine revs) (horn honking) Where you going? Home. We are home. But you dumped me? I didn't dump you. You get off that already. Well, you never called, Well, we're here aren't we? Yeah, but for what, a quickie? Am I gonna see you? You just try to keep me away. (passionate kissing) God, I missed you so much. (passionate kissing) When? When what? Am I gonna see you? Look, you see me when you see me, okay? Well you got to get a life here, Amy. I told you things are gonna work out, but we can't be impatient. Why don't you hang out with your friends? You girlfriend. Maybe get some exercise. I'll fix you up with my trainer. Those thighs could use it. (door bangs) Listen, I've had it. Look, I've got a lot of work to do, I'll see you tonight. Yeah. Right. Damn. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry about the interruption. It's all right. What I'll do is, I'll set up a training program for you. Personalized program. So, am I gonna look as good as you? Do you wanna look as good as me? Well, you look pretty good. So do you. We'll be working on toning, not bulking up. You know how to use this equipment? Sure. Show me. No, no, no, no, hold on. Yes, well done, nice and slow. Right. There you go. Let it up nice and slow, nice and slow. (door closing) Radical. What do you do in here? Work out? Hey, I came here looking for a trainer. Anyway, what would your wife say? We're not married, besides we have an understanding. Like what? She lives her life and I live mine. Amy, Joey's just as big a sleaze now as he ever was and you can't believe a word he says, you know that. So what are you doing? I love him. But he's gonna dump you again. No, this time he is mine. (upbeat music) Hey, Joey. Paulie. Hey, Mr. B, long time no see. You looking all flabby. What you a wise guy? Come here. I sent you a referral. She ever show up, a girl about 17. Nice body. Amy, yeah. Yeah, that's it, Amy Fisher. Yeah, that's the girl. I got her on a program, personal program. Yeah, that's good. That's good. She needs it. Is there anything else you want to tell me, Mr. B? No, no, she's a good kid. I know her old, man. All right, I'm gonna hit it. Okay. I'll see you later. So, this guy, Paul, he's hot? And if he's good looking, why not? You know, a little jealousy to keep old Joey honest. Thanks for helping, cleaning this place is a drag. So what's my reward? What do you have in mind? I don't know. What do you have in mind? (pager beeping) You wanna use the phone? No. It's nobody. I won't tell Joey you said that. Come on, I'll take you out and buy you something to eat, but I got to stop by my house first. All right. Can I ride with you? Sure. Come on in. This is the living room. Make yourself at home and I will be right back. Okay. What are these for? The shotguns? You never seen one before? I hate guns. (pager beeping) So, where's the bedroom? Upstairs. And who sleeps there? She does. So where are you? In the guest room. Look, it's kinda complicated. Hey, what, you're still seeing Joey. I am not. Amy, you can't lie to me. With a teacher like Joey, don't bet on it. Anyways it's true. So how come he's always beeping you? He's jealous. Yeah, but there's nothing going on. There isn't? No wonder the guy hasn't come back to the gym. It's over. I mean, for me it is, you know, we're friends and all, and sometimes I'll let him take me out to dinner. We talk, but no sex. Come on, Amy. Really. He wants to, but I won't let him. (soft music) You doing him? No, but what if I was? With your body or your mind? What do you think? You know, that guy, he's scum. He's nice to me. Yeah, sure he's nice to you. He wants something. You know, he deals drugs, steroids. Hey, you didn't know that did you, well it's true. Well, you told me to go there. Yeah. I told you to go there to work out. Okay, I don't want you talking to him, right. You don't say anything about us to him. Us, as in marriage? What are you talking about, marriage? Who said anything about marriage? I said, we'd be together, but marriage, I've been married. Yeah, but not to me. A sports cars better, believe me. I'd rather have you. A black one, like my cat, Angel. I'll buy you a sports car. You can drive me around. What do you think of that? (soft music) What could I think? Cause I wanted him. I wanted the life I'd learned with him. The only trouble was I began to want you too, cause we'd talk, you know? And it was nice. Felt easy. Now can we go dancing? You got it. Take a shower. Just a shower? (soft chuckle) Come here. Okay. Close your eyes. Why? You'll see. Keep your eyes closed. Okay. Open. Turn you on? (soft music) Is that what you're gonna do to me? Anytime. Where's the camera. I'll get it. He keeps telling me, you know that he loves me. That he wants to be with me. That we're gonna be together. It's gonna happen. But it never does. There's always Paul. He lives with somebody. Yeah, but he's not married. Right? Do you love him? Sometimes I think maybe I could. Then dump Joey. I can't. I can't. I love him. Look, I don't see you dumping your boyfriend. Dump, if I catch the little whore that he's been seeing, bang! That's realistic. What do you know? Oh like you could really get a gun? You call me a liar? You could? Sure, anytime. But hey, let's not get carried away. For me? For you? The little princess. Come on, seriously. Seriously. What for, robbing banks? Look, maybe you're right. Maybe it is time that somebody took control. Is this a joke? This is a joke, right? Right? People ask me if I meant it. Paul, did I really want her dead? I never thought about it. All I thought about was having Joey. Except sometimes when I was with you. Paul, can I ask you a question? Do you think if you love somebody that it's all right to have sex with other people. Who told you that? I think it's false love. You know you got to stop listening to Joey. I'm not, I'm not even seeing him anymore. So where's all your money coming from? Joey never gave me money. I work. Doing what? Just a job. An escort job? Who told you about that? You think people don't know, don't talk? Well, there's nothing to talk about. I don't do it anymore. And besides, it was never sexual or anything. (pager beeping) Right, like that's not Joey? Well can I help it if he calls? You can get rid of your beeper. Why should I miss calls from my friends? (persistent beeping) You know, he acts like he owns me, you know. Like I'm his possession or something. Why does he think that if you not still seeing him? Fine. Don't believe me all right. It's not like you care about me anyway. Amy, I do. Do you? Then how come you keep rejecting me? Rejecting? Does your girlfriend know about me? Does she? So what's honest about that? I told you we have an arrangement, right? What you and I have together is great, but I can't get involved into another relationship, not right now. Then I'm gonna go out with other guys. I think you should. Good, watch me. (somber music) (engine running) Amy, I'm telling you, this is crazy. Just introduce us. Darren. Amy. Hey. Hi. I heard you could help me out. Maybe, it'll cost you. How much? Depends what you want. I want you to hit someone. Who? My boyfriend's wife. So, what do you want me to hit her with, my fist? (soft laughter) No, a gun. Well, that'll cost you. So when can you do it, tomorrow, next week? What next year? What? I'll call you. Hey, you know, I heard that before. Maybe we should find somebody else, you know. Somebody with guts. Hey, I can do it. Soon. I wanted to stay mad at you, Paul. But I couldn't. Maybe because I kept hoping things between us would change. I don't know who to believe anymore. Me. I want to. All those things that Joey's been telling you about me. They're not true. He's just jealous. What you still hanging around him for? He loves me. Do you still love him? If it wasn't for his wife. Oh, you really believe that? You know, sometimes when I'm with you, I feel so good about myself, you know? Like I could really do something with my life. I could open a store, you know? And sell clothes, these really beautiful clothes. I'd get married. Have kids. Sounds good. Maybe I could even go with you to Texas. I know, I know, things are complicated, but I want to be with you. I mean, I want to do things with you. For you. You want me to do something for you? Something special. (birds chirping) (engine running) (door slams) Where were you? I've been calling. With friends like you told me. I bet I know who. Yeah, and where were you? At home with my kids. And your wife? How could you let this guy come between us? He cares about me. What, and I don't? You're the one that's cutting me off, Amy. Because, I don't know what our future is. Baby, it's whatever you want it to be. Yeah. Right. (door slams) Hey, Joey loves you! Say it! Say it! Joey loves me. And we'll always be together. Are you telling me the truth. How could I lie to you? How could I tell? (soft music) Is that a lie, is our future lie? (keys pounding) Crystal? Did he get it? Why did you tell them? My mom asked me. I mean, all I said was we were going on a trip. So now your dad calls me up threatening to have me arrested if I take you out of the state. Amy? I was mad all right. I wanted to get out of there to be with you, was all I said and that we might move to... Texas, yeah. Well, what's wrong with that? You mean besides it not being true? It could be. And anyway, who are you to talk about truth? Things are complicated. You know who you're starting to sound like? Because I won't make you phony promises, because I won't pretend things are different than they are? I'm not the one telling lies about my life. I don't lie. Amy, you lie to everybody, me, your parents and especially yourself and don't bother denying it again, because it'll be just another lie. I didn't used to be this way. Get away from him. How? Just do it. And then will you be with me? You can't keep living your life like this. Will you be with me? See you preach about honesty and you say you love me, but you're no different, with your things are complicated and your videotapes. You wait a minute. I am no Joey. So prove it. Please help me, I need you. I want to believe what you say, that my life could be different. I want to have the courage to make my life different. Please Paul, I need you, just help me, just love me. (soft music) Those things I said, Paul, I didn't mean them. I know you're not like that. I know you care, but still I wonder what would have happened if life wasn't complicated. If we could have been together. You were my last hope. Okay. Okay, I'll do it. Yeah? Yeah. All right. So when? Soon, okay. I still got to get the gun. So how long would that take? Money talks. Sure. Yeah, yeah, I got money, how much? Eight hundred aught to do it. Eight hundred. (money rustling) Eight. Right. Okay, now how long will it take? A few days I'll beep you and don't forget, steal some plates. (soft music) Nobody touches like you do. You remember that, all right. How could I forget. That's when I told him. He's denying all this too. But I remember when I said to him, "I got a surprise for you". And he said, "What"? And I went, "Bang". And at first he didn't know what I was talking about. He thought I was just kidding. But then when he knew I was serious, he said, "You would do that for me"? And when I told him, I wasn't sure if I could, I remember he took my hand in his hands and he looked into my eyes and he said, "I care about you, I want you to be safe. Are you sure you're strong enough to do this"? And I figured, Joey wouldn't let anything happen to me. I didn't think about life and death. I didn't think about anything. Featured like him. I came with friends, possessed, desiring this man's art and that man's scope. It's what I most enjoy, content at, least. (pager beeping) I got to make a phone call. It's important. Can't it wait? No. Got it. (pager beeping) Hold on, okay, hold on. Joey. I can't talk now I'll call you later. I love you. Hi. Okay listen, meet me at my house at 11 o'clock. (soft music) Mary Jo. Hi. Chairs are looking good. Thank you. Hey, How's Joey, I haven't seen him lately? Good, good. Working hard. Good. (phone rings) Excuse me. But you said it yourself. It's no big deal, right? Yeah that's right, no big deal. No big deal, so you do it. (heavy breathing) What if she attacks me or something? You just, that's why you got this, right? Safety's off, okay. Okay. There you go, all right. Put it in there. Snap, snap. She comes at you. You just aim and shoot. Bang, bang. Okay. Go on take it. (dramatic music) (doorbell rings) Can I help you? Yeah, are you Mrs. Joseph Buttafuoco? Yeah. I want to talk to you about your husband, Joey. What's this about? (nervous laugh) Well, it's not every day I confront a wife you know. What about Joey? He's having an affair with my little 16 year old sister. Really? What's your name? Ann Baker. Where do you live, Ann? Over in Bahava. Honey, Bahava is that way. What's going on? Where do you really live? Dolphin Coy. Who's that? My boyfriend? What are you trying to pull here? Look, I I'm telling you, your husband is having an affair with my little sister. And I just think the idea of a 40 year old man sleeping with a 16 year old girl is disgusting. Well, he's not 40 yet. Let me see this. It's not even Joey's size. I'm telling you. Who are you really, Bobrick Zoe's daughter? No. He gave her that shirt. Joey gives these shirts to lots of people, doesn't prove anything. I am telling you the truth. Okay. When does she see him? Where? (confused muttering) See, you don't even know, you lying little bitch. You don't even want to know. Oh, I know my husband. He wouldn't do something like this. You, know Joey, what scum he is. Get outta here. I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna call Joey. Now you get the hell off my property! Now! (dramatic music) (loud gun shot) (terrified screaming) (dramatic music) (gate bangs) The gun, the gun, get the gun. (dramatic music) C'mon, c'mon. (dramatic music) (tyre's screeching) (dramatic music) Oh my God. I'll call 911. Mary Jo, Mary Jo, you're going to be all right. Amy, give me the gun. Give me the gun. What happened to it, where's the rest of it? It's pulled apart man. Take it easy Amy. Oh man, she went down. Amy, you dropped... She went down, man. Amy, you all right? Darren's gonna take you home, Amy. (phone rings) Tides Auto Body. (sirens whaling) (crowd talking) (helicopter blades churning) Easy now, easy easy. (engines running) Joey. What, what's going on? What happened? Mary Jo. Joey. (helicopter blades churning) Mary Jo, Mary Jo. (door closing) (somber music) Crystal, I did it. (water pouring) Amy. There's blood. Everywhere. Where'd you shoot her? Is she dead? Oh God. Lie down. Come on. My dad's gonna kill me. I gotta call Paul. No, you don't talk to nobody. Nobody. All right? You shot her in the head. She'll die. You just gotta wait, you know, you gotta stay calm and act normal. Just close your eyes. Close your eyes and sleep. Just pretended it's a dream, a bad dream. But when I woke up, it was real. And now, even if I get out on bail, I'm gonna be in a place like this, maybe for the rest of my life. (camera's clicking) While Joey's walking around free telling everybody, Amy Fisher, well, yeah, I had pizza with her once. The bottom line is, I never touched her. Never. That's not what she claims. That's the end of the story. (reporters shouting) Excuse me. I have to go take care of my wife. How is your wife Mr. Buttafuoco? We'd like to know. How do you think she is? She was shot in the head. If he's telling the truth, if he never touched me, then how come I passed the lie detector test? How come I know he's got two black moles on the inside of his thigh. Oh God. Why did I shoot her? (soft music) I didn't want to, I didn't mean to. When I was standing on that porch and I saw her eyes. She wasn't just this obstacle to Joey anymore. She was human, but she wouldn't listen. She dismissed me. I was so mad and the gun was in my hand. And now we're both victims. I'm sorry. So sorry for all the pain I caused. Joey, Joey, he's the worst thing that ever happened to me. You know, what's really sick. I think I still love him. Mary Jo Buttafuoco survived, but is permanently disabled. Joey Buttafuoco continues to insist that his relationship with Amy Fisher was casual and innocent. He denies it was sexual or that he played any part in Amy's prostitution or in planning and carrying out her crime. The district attorney has declined to file charges against him. While out on bail, Amy Fisher met with Paul Makely in his office. She was videotaped there without her knowledge or consent. The video tape later appeared on a tabloid television show. No one knows how the program obtained the tape. Amy Fisher pled guilty to reckless assault, was sentenced to five to 15 years and is serving her time at a correctional facility in New York state.
