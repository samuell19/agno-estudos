MAY 10, 1914 BUCHAREST A DESTINY FOR ROMANIA CAROL (CHARLES) I A day that seems ordinary. June 28, 1914 Carol I of Romania is 75 years old and an incredible reign of 48 years. The longest government in our history. He is the creator of a modern Romania and he is also the one who realized the monarchy, becoming the first king of Romania respected by all the monarchies and all the greats of Europe. The country is doing well. Politically, it is stable. Economic, in progress. From 4.5 million in 1866, it now reaches 7.5 million. It has a modern army that won independence on the battlefield. It grew in territory by joining Dobrogea, Quadrilateru and Serpilor Island. Queen Elisabeta, Elisabeta de Wied, known as a poet under the pseudonym of Carmen Silva. Carol had met her in 1869 in Prussia. He was visiting his family and a friend, Wilhelm, recommended her as a wife. They got engaged on October 15, 1869. A month later they got married. Carol was 30 years old. Elizabeth, 27. I had a strange dream that reminded me of the carriage ride from Giurgiu to Bucharest. It was my first time in the country. Not a trace of railways. Poor, bitter villages.. Small, disorganized towns. Clogged roads. And dust... a lot of dust. How much had to be done... for the country to become acceptable. But you did them. You made them! Why do all these things come to my mind? When I arrived in Bucharest in May 1866 they gave me bread and salt, then they took me to the Parliament to take the oath on the Constitution. I knew only one word in Romanian. "I swear" Everyone was happy. And I thought... - I remember this well - about Cuza's fate. And what Bismark had told me, that I won't last more than three or four years until they drive me away. But now there is peace and quiet. We are old. After all, Bismark was not right. Romania has an industry. A railway network with the longest bridge in Europe. And an exit to the sea with a functional bridge set up in Constanta. The government is liberal, dynastic. Carol has a descendant. They recently received in Constanta, with great pomp, the visit of Tsar Nicolae and the Russian imperial family. VISIT OF THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL FAMILY TO CONSTANTA. JULY 14, 1914 THE PRESS The visit of the Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II and his family took place after the Balkan war of 1912-1913 in which Romania added the three southern counties of Dobrogea. Durostor, Caliacra and Silistra In other words, the Quadrilateral. To ensure dynastic continuity, Carol chooses Ferdinand as his successor. One of his brother's sons. He also chooses his wife, Princess Maria of Edinburgh. They both have many grandchildren. We are looking forward to taking over the throne. What's new? Franz Ferdinand and his wife are in Serbia. Yesterday he inspected the troops, today they are visiting Sarajevo. Worldliness of the time. Even worldliness has its charm, uncle. I'm not talking about balls anymore. I am sure that in this field you know more than I do. It was much more useful for us if Emperor Franz Josef sent the crown prince to Hungary to bully the Hungarians with their politics in Transylvania. In Transylvania there are extremely unpleasant things. I hear this every day. What to do with them? As you can see, the emperors have other things to do. Carol, you haven't eaten anything today. You stay, I go. Uncle knew that after all he could count on me even if he couldn't make me obey every command. Age and illness have softened this iron man a lot. Carol is overwhelmed by thoughts. He remembers his youth. The first years of the prince of the two Romanian countries. Right from the beginning, he got down to business. He had obtained the favor of the guarantor powers regarding his ascension to the throne of the principalities. In July 1866, he signs the Romanian Constitution new law, considered one of the most democratic in Europe at that time. He had started the construction of railways he had married The only event that he could fully enjoy was the birth in 1870 of his daughter, Maria. A moment of life that brought happiness to Carol and Elizabeth. However, the political situation was not at all calm. Governments fail too often. The fight between the parties had become tense and full of accusations. The prince was caught in the middle. Attacked both by the press and the opposition. In addition, his brother, Leopold he was supported by Bismark in the attempt to obtain the throne of Spain. The success of this enterprise would have influenced the balance between the Great Powers of Europe strongly shaking the situation in the country. The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war and the German victories over France complicated Carol's situation even more. It was known that the prince had a special attachment to Prussia - the Motherland. While Romanian politicians and public opinion were declared philo-French. The reality is that Romania was increasingly difficult to govern. Any act of strengthening the authority collides with an impractical and abnormally free Constitution. In relation to the development of Romanian society. The Romanians' anti-German attitude is confused with the one they have towards Austria-Hungary which owns Transylvania, a province with a majority Romanian population. Above all, among the radical liberals an unexpected anti-dynastic position was taking shape. The radical liberals were preparing a coup. The man who organized this conspiracy in which Nicolae Golescu and I C Bratianu were involved it was Eugenio Carrada. A type of adventurer who still had the courage to take responsibility for his actions. On the night of August 7 to 8 3:30 in the morning, in Ploiesti, Candiano Popescu, dressed as a captain occupies the prefecture and takes over the connection with the telegraph. From here he calls the troops from Predeal for help and proclaim what we know as the "Republic of Ploiesti" Eugenio Carrada realizes the disaster and intervenes, causing Candiano Popescu to give up the action and run away. Trying to save what could be saved, Carrada returns to Bucharest. Convincing I C Bratianu, the Golescu brothers, and C A Rosetti not to take refuge abroad. The "Republic of Ploiesti" seemed more like a warning than a serious threat to Carol's position. However, the country was exposed to a crisis. The conspirators were arrested, but in less than an hour the charges were acquitted and released from custody. Carol is alone against the country. The state of mind and the political situation in which it is found are well described by a letter received in September 1870 from Karl Anton, his father.. The belief that a defeat of France would have been followed by your dethronement you should have gotten rid of the situation you have there a long time ago. Being supported by German victories is not a foreboding for the future. Because the roots of your government must be found in Romania, not in Germany. For Carol, then leaving the throne of the Principalities was not the best solution. The gesture would have dishonored his name and the House of Hohenzollern. He could have tried a coup d'Ã©tat in his turn that would ensure him the absolute leadership of the Principalities. But he did not feel capable of becoming a dictator. He needed support. At the end of November, he writes to the leaders of Europe. Bismark, the chancellor of Prussia, replied: "Your highness cannot expect any help from abroad." Franz Josef, Emperor of Austria-Hungary was protocol, subtle and vaguely threatening. The Tsar of Russia, Alexander, gave him a piece of advice: "Everywhere only the intervention of good people makes revolutions successful Conservative elements exist in Romania Fear of the disorder that would follow after your withdrawal can help to group them around you." The tension between him, politicians and the country has dangerously accumulated. The moment he feared appears sooner than he expected. For the evening of March 22, 1871 the German colony in Bucharest organized a banquet in honor of Emperor Wilhelm I wishing the celebration of his birthday and victory in the war. Around 8 p.m. the street lamps went out the bells of the Sarindari church began to ring. Sala Slatineanu where the event took place is attacked with stones by a group led by students. The group of students heads towards the palace shouting "Long live the republic" Carol summons the royal lieutenant, Nicolae Golescu and Lascar Catargiu. He informs them that he has decided to resign. Calm and wise, Lascar Catargiu refuses his abdication. Carol asks for a new government to be formed and the Parliament to meet in a special session. At midnight Lascar Catargiu presented the list to the new conservative government. On March 23, 1871, Charles wrote to Wilhelm I: Frightened by this threatening danger, all factions of the conservative party united and formed the new government". Alexander, Tsar of Russia, has the solution. Conservative Lascar Catargiu will govern the country for 5 years. Continuity in government provided the country with stability, balance and the respite he needed. Carol broke the deadlock, but she didn't have much time to enjoy herself. In 1874, in a scarlet fever epidemic, Carol and Elisabeta lost their beloved daughter, Maria. The death of their only daughter affects them deeply. Bringing between them shadows of coldness and silence that they will hardly overcome. Elisabeta could no longer give him children. 1877. The year of obtaining Romania's independence. It was never like that. Nothing. 1877, the year Romania gained independence. The Russo-Turkish war broke out on April 24, 1877 and on May 21, 1877 met in extraordinary session The Parliament announces that all links with the Ottoman Gate are broken. And Romania proclaimed its independence. "In a state of war, with broken bonds, what are we? We are INDEPENDENT! We are an independent nation! We will have to prove that we are a living nation that we are aware of our measure that we are able to make sacrifices to keep this country and its rights for our children! And this mission, at the moment it is entrusted to our brothers and sons who will die abroad! The telegram arrived 40 minutes ago, your Maria. I think, gentlemen, that this is the signal we have been waiting for. Trnovo, July 19, 1877, 7:37 p.m. Urgent for Prince Carol of Romania. "Turkey, gathering the largest masses of troops in Plevna, is crushing us. Please make a merger, a demonstration and if possible cross the Danube with the army as you wish." Between Jiu and Corabia, this demonstration is absolutely necessary to facilitate my movements." The military situation must be particularly difficult for the Grand Duke if he resorted to this telegram. I believe that we must give him all the necessary help whenever and as long as the dancers want. Otherwise, the Turks will throw them over the Danube and Romania can become the theater of war. If Maria decides, we can give the order immediately for the rest of the 4th division to reinforce the Romanian garrison at Nicopole. And the 3rd Infantry Division to cross Jiul and occupy the position of the 4th Division. Also, the construction of the vessel bridge over the Danube must begin immediately. Let the fire be opened on the entire line of the Danube! Especially in Vidin! Mr. Bratianu, Mr. Colonel Slaniceanu will go to the High Command of the Russian Army and they will deal with the conditions of the passage of the Romanian army over the Danube. I want you to definitely mention it to our friends and allies that the Romanian army will enter the battle but only under the supreme command of its commander. Carol I, elected ruler in 1866, we can say that after 11 years of reign he completely identified with the aspirations of the Romanian nation. Maria ta, the Romanian troops are ready to cross the Danube! Health, children! To live! Good way, good way, the drum beats Good way, brave Romanians With the bag tied on the back With the weapons in the hands. Whether it's a sunny day or a cloudy sky Come rain or snow, we go joyfully. Good way, good way, the drum beats Good way, brave Romanians With the bag tied on the back With the weapons in the hands. Either at the parade or at war All of us in a row Happy bunch we go. The reports I have received inform me that it is an admirable army that is eager to fight. We still have to clarify a detail. Are you still determined to take on the responsibility of personally commanding the Romanian army? It seems to me that it is beyond any discussion. Yes.. But this decision, which I was expecting, creates certain difficulties. You, the reigning prince, cannot be put under the command of a Russian general. Obvious. But several Russian generals can be placed under the command of the ruler of Romania. Things have been decided, Nicola. The Prince of Romania will take over the leadership of the troops in front of Plevna. The army that will be called the "Western Army" The Romanian ruler takes command of the Western Army establishing its headquarters in Poradim, 7 km from Plevna. On September 8, the first attack of the Romanian troops against Plevna takes place and is entrusted to the 13th Dorobanti regiment of the 3rd Division. The attack started at 15:00. The attack column enters under the rain of bullets from the Grivita redoubt. With all the effort, the attack is repelled in less than 30 minutes. Carol realized the critical situation in which the armies that actually attacked two redoubts were put and not just one. Before! The existence of two redoubts and a redan it was the cause of failure and the loss of 1300 soldiers and 27 officers. The Romanian command decided to make a last and supreme attempt at 18:00. The 4th Romanian division attacked from the front on the right flank and the Russian battalions from the south, from the left flank. Start with the stairs! Your height! Reduta Grivita 2 communicates: The strength of the opponent far exceeded the previous evaluations. The fact that the Ottoman army from Plevna had come under the command of Osman Pasa, a good military man, complicated things. Who drew up the maps and took care of the reconnaissance of the terrain from the Romanian army? Captain Rahovan, Maria Ta. To be sent to the first line. What losses do we have? For now the numbers are not exact, about 50 officers and over 2000 soldiers from the 4th division. I have no report from the third division. A communication from the High Command. General Scobelev conquered the second redoubt from Grisina. There is only one way to prevent Osman from counterattacking, let us attack and conquer this redoubt. Do you think it's possible? I don't know, Maria Ta. I sent them three times in this mad attack. When it was so simple to.. We will speak conditionally at the age of memories, Mr. General. I leave it to your discretion how you will convince the soldiers to start again. The conquest of the Grivita 1 redoubt was paid dearly by the Romanian troops. The Russian troops had even greater losses. 197 officers and 12471 soldiers. The flags of the 1 Dorobanti and 2 Vanatori regiments were planted on the conquered redoubt. I worship this champagne glass of the first victory won by the young Romanian army on the Plevna front. I drink in the health of the Romanian army, of its bravery and conduct. In the health of its supreme commander. Then he got his first big success. But the battles were just coming and had to be won. The Romanian troops located between Vit and Iscar commanded by colonel George Slaniceanu occupied after heavy fighting the city - citadel of Rahova located approx. 60 km northwest of Plevna. On November 9, General Lupu's troops, coordinating their actions with those of Colonel George Slaniceanu conquer Rahova, bringing a victory that belongs entirely to the Romanian Army. After the attempt to break the siege of Plevna Osman Pasa will again force the breakthrough of the front during the night. Almost certainly the enemy's penetration action will be focused on the Plevna Sofia road. Consequently, we will adopt the following plan of operations: General Scobelev, with the two brigades he commands, will support General Ganetki. And the command of my sector? General Snitikov will take over. Mr. General Krutner, you will receive 3 battalions from the 4th sector as reinforcements. Mr. General Cernat, you take 4 Romanian battalions from/ and transfer them to the support of the 4th division. Colonel Cerchez. With the third division you will be ready at the right moment to occupy Plevna. Gentlemen.. I am sure that you will brilliantly execute the assigned missions. I wish you success! Your brightness! The civilians went after us and blocked the roads. Any attempt to return to Plevna is impossible. Colonel, I have orders from Osman Pasha, the generalissimo of the Ottoman troops, to escort you to his luminary. I follow you. I am colonel Mihail Cristodulo Cerchez, from the Romanian army. Defeated and wounded, Osman will surrender to the Romanian colonel Cerchez together with him capitulating the Ottoman army from Plevna of about 34,000 men. The Berlin peace treaty of July 1, 1878 recognized Romania's state independence but conditioned by the amendment of Article 7 of the Constitution regarding the right of foreigners, mainly Jews, to land. Dobrogea, the Danube Delta and Serpilor Island were attributed to Romania. Instead, being forced to cede the three southern counties of Bessarabia to Russia. Bolgrad, Cahul and Ismail. When the gentleman and his government complain about the fact that the Russian troops behave in the country's capital like occupation troops the former ally threatens to disarm the Romanian troops. Carol I's reply sent to Tsar Alexander II on March 21, 1878 is categorical: "The Romanian army can fight until it is destroyed, but it will not allow itself to be disarmed." March 26, 1881 Following the vote given by the Parliament, the country becomes a monarchy and Carol will be the first king of Romania. The proclamation of the kingdom will be a guarantee of stability and peace in the south-east of Europe. The coronation ceremony of King Carol I and Queen Elizabeth took place in the country's capital on May 10, 1881. 1907 was not a very happy year for King Carol I. The peasant uprising in Romania showed the fact that the agrarian problem had still remained unresolved. With all the interference of the Russians in starting the riots it must be recognized that the violence of the army's behavior and the repression orders have left heavy traces. It is a stain on the image of King Charles. When you wait for them, the news looks for you alone, especially when they are bad. What is it, Mr. Basset? Your Majesty, there has been an attack in Sarajevo. I don't know much, everything is still too confusing. An attack? Yes, sire. Against Franz Ferdinand and his wife. Both? Yes, sire. If the attack was successful, the situation could become very serious. I want to know everything, Mr. Basset. In detail. Yes, Your Majesty. The visit of the heir to the throne, Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sofia, to Sarajevo, in Bosnia posed serious problems to the Austrian police. The visit had been decided by Wilhelm II who, in turn, was advised by court wise men that the visit must be made. Governor Pochorek stated: "I know my Bosnians. You will miss the opportunity of extraordinary ovations" Instead of ovations, Ferdinand was awaited at an intersection by Serb bullets. The one who succeeded in the attack, Gavrilo Princip, a 19-year-old young man he said in his last words at the trial "We loved the people. In my defense I say nothing." Gavrilo Princip, being a minor, was sentenced to 20 years in prison but he died of tuberculosis in the next 3 years. He did not have enough information to assess the situation. He had to wait for Basset's return. The thought of complications that could involve him against his will.. He couldn't please her. He had gone through enough crises. And I don't think he wanted any more. Austria-Hungary feels deeply injured and demands satisfaction. The ultimatum addressed to Serbia imposes humiliating conditions in terms that seem unacceptable. Russia intervenes in favor of Serbia. And at this moment, through their reaction, the two great European powers involve in their conflict the Triple Alliance and the Entente. Externally, Romania was linked to the Central Powers having secretly signed an alliance treaty with Austria-Hungary. The country does not sympathize in any way with the interests of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the issue of Transylvania and the problems of the Romanians across the mountains being among the most alive in the Romanian public consciousness. The king tries to hide his fears and grievances, trying to control the situation. On July 28, Austria makes a general mobilization and declares war on Serbia. Your majesty.. A letter from Franz Joseph. Your old friendship and our friendly ties are just as many guarantees that you will have a sincere understanding of the decisions I made in this serious case. Contrary to expectations, Serbia gave in to all of Austria-Hungary's demands even exceeding limits that I could not believe. This declaration of war without being consulted beforehand it is a violation of my rights as an ally. On July 15, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. A day later, in a statement signed by Bratianu the Romanian government clearly shows its desire to remain neutral in the face of the conflict that is being announced. On July 31, he receives another letter, this time from Wilhelm II, the German emperor. You founded a civilized state at the mouth of the Danube and thus raised a flag in front of the wave of Islam. I trust you, as a king, as an ally and as a Hohenzollern you will remain faithful to your friends. The answer was not easy to give. On August 1, 1914, Germany declared war on Russia. On the same day, Carol summoned I C Bratianu, his prime minister, to Peles. Mr. Bratianu, Germany's declaration of war against Russia obliges us to make a final decision. Your Majesty, you know my opinion. I see no other viable solution for this political moment than neutrality. Emperor Wilhelm wrote to me and I have the guarantee through his word. That he will support us in obtaining Bessarabia stolen by the Russians in 1812. And Russia promises, Your Majesty. The foreign minister contacted us giving us to understand that if we decide to fight against Austria Hungary they will consider joining Transylvania to the country. Both sides promise territories that are rightfully ours. I remain convinced that neutrality, at least for now, is the best choice we can make. I remind you that we have a treaty and we must respect it. Between the word of the king and the country, I make no difference, Your Majesty. Their honor is one and no one can question it, Your Majesty. The problem is that Austria-Hungary is attacking and our treaty is defensive. I appreciate your honesty and the strength of your feelings but sentiment should not guide a valuable politician, as I know you. You can be convinced, Your Majesty. I am sure that you will recognize the fact that the treaty brought us benefits. At first, Your Majesty. We have no way of trusting the politics of the Russians when in 1877, after we won together the war against the Turks they kidnapped the three counties from the mouths of the Danube. Gentlemen, as you know, I received a letter from Grand Duke Nicholas of Adrianople. In which he announces the signing of the peace treaty with the Turks. At the same time, he asks us to order the Romanian army to cease hostilities on the Vidin front. I would like to know your opinion, the opinion of the government and what you have decided to do. We come to you after 8 hours of discussions. We believe that your Majesty should respond to the Grand Duke in the most friendly terms but through the relations of friendship and kinship that bind you to the Romanov family to ask the Grand Duke for a solution that does not diminish Romania's dignity. But on the contrary, to defend his interests. Did you draft this letter? Yes, Your Majesty, we have allowed ourselves to write this letter. I will send this letter to Tsar Alexander II. We decided to convene the Crown Council for the 3rd of the month, at 5 pm in Peles. Then we will make a final decision. I trust that until then you will do everything you can to get from the government and the party you lead the execution of the treaty, as the circumstances require. Your Majesty, you are giving me a difficult task, the success of which I do not believe. But I promise you that I will try everything possible. Bratianu was determined to impose neutrality as the political attitude of the moment He had done his calculations carefully and was not willing to risk anything to obtain a majority in favor of the solution agreed by the government. In the little time he has left until the meeting of the Crown Council Carol arranges several meetings with opposition leaders. You are right, Mr. Marghiloman. Romania can no longer live within its current borders. After Russia is defeated, Romania's clock will also ring. And on the day when Austria-Hungary will liquidate no more than 20 years we will take Transylvania and Banat. These are the natural and natural boundaries. Marghiloman understood the problem of conscience that troubled the king. Varying between a war on the side of the Entente or neutrality Marghiloman are kept at the level of a protocol restraint. Wilhelm, Franz Josef and the Tsar think only of their own interests. In '66 they told me: "Don't take the country. We can't support you." In the 70s "Get out, it's your job" In 77 "Don't cross the Danube!" "Don't go to war" And now, everyone will go to war and everyone wants me on their side. It's August 1, 1914 and a little while ago Carol received a telegram from the German chancellor. He was urgently required to mobilize the Romanian army immediately and direct it against Russia. In the morning of the next day, Germany declares war on France. The crown council was not a body provided by the country's constitution. It included the prime minister, the entire government, the president of the chamber of deputies some of the former prime ministers and the leaders of the opposition parliamentary parties. Carol decided that the treaty signed in 1883 with Austria-Hungary not to be submitted to the Parliament for ratification Renewed in 1913, the treaty and its provisions remained secret. The king prefers not to reveal it to everyone, only to the prime ministers. His Majesty the King! To be precise, allow me to read the document in French. Faced with this dangerous situation, I feel the need to consult with the statesmen of my country, to know their opinion in these serious moments. The European war was declared. I appeal to your discretion and patriotism to ease my heavy burden and the immense responsibility that presses upon me today, especially when Romania is faced with a decision that will decide its future. A sentimental policy seems inadmissible to me at a time when the fate of the whole of Europe is at stake. Prudence is a great virtue but it should not be pushed too far. In the hours of ultimate danger, courage and decision prevail. So we have to decide which path we will follow. I have in mind, first of all, neutrality. Romania does not deserve to be exposed to such a humiliation that it has known before. We have to decide for one or the other of the groups that are at war. So we only have a third possibility. Triple Alliance. It is beyond any doubt that in this formidable war she will win the final victory. It is a matter of honor for any country to keep its word. At the end of my reign and at the end of my life, I have only one wish: that of ensuring a bright future for Romania. This prospect is almost a certainty because after the war no decision can be made without Romania's voice being heard. And this time, if God wills it, with honor and glory! I C BRATIANU-president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of War Your Majesty, I would like to be allowed to speak last. I think it would be appropriate for those from the opposition to express their first points of view. THEODOR ROSETTI-Leader of the Conservative Party Your Majesty, gentlemen I don't think it's in our power to do big politics. Now the big ones have taken over. We cannot get involved in their fights. Let's stay apart, let's see each other from our troubles. Gentlemen, we cannot remain neutral! P P CARP-head of the Conservative Party until 1913 Neither from a moral point of view, nor from a material point of view! Even if we wanted to do it, we can't! In a conflict of such size we will be fatally invaded! Either by some or by others! What is the interest of the Romanian state? Should Slavism or Germanism triumph? This is why, without any hesitation, I ask that we go on the side of the triple agreement. We immediately declare war on Russia. The king spoke in the language of duty and honor. Let's follow him. Romania to fulfill its obligations. I agree, Mr. Carp. ALEXANDRU MARGHILOMAN-Conservative Party. States must respect their signature. If we were committed to Germany and Austria, no doubt would be possible. But we are employed, right? I will read to you myself. 1883, Article 2. If Romania, without any provocation, would be attacked from its side Austria-Hungary undertakes to give timely help and assistance against the aggressor. If Austria-Hungary is attacked, under the same circumstances Casus foederis (alliance case) Romania will present itself immediately for the latter. It would be good, Your Majesty, to know what the last treaty, the one renewed in 1913, also provides. Identical. In the present case, I do not consider it to be "Casus foederis" We have no obligation to intervene unless our allies are attacked. Or they attack first. So we have no obligation to intervene. Judge, no one has the right to accuse us. If we go with Austria-Hungary, with Germany, sir. We should not underestimate the fact that public opinion is against a war with the Triple Alliance. If we admit today what is being done against the Serbs tomorrow it can be done against us. The independence of small states becomes a simple illusion. I think that for the moment it is more prudent to wait. I opt for armed neutrality to secure our borders. Sire, by helping Austria-Hungary we are preparing for a frightening future. IANCU LAHOVARY-Conservative Party What if, between an all-powerful Hungary persecuting the Romanian element even worse, to the north, a hostile Serbia a Bulgaria strengthened by Austria to the south a Russia of 150 million Slavs in the east? Public opinion is decided against entering the war with Austria-Hungary. The neutrality of Italy decreases more and more the chances of success of the Central Powers. I am sure that Italy will immediately enter the war. TACHE IONESCU-Democratic Conservative Party We have to take into account public sentiment. By the fact that Germany and Austria-Hungary declared war without communicating their intentions to us in advance. I see no other solution for Romania than political neutrality. Poor Elisabeta lived moments of terror while her sick husband presided over the Crown Council. Although he hated the war, he looked at it with the same eyes as he trusted in the omnipotence of Germany. She took me with her without stopping to talk. I was silent and my heart was beating like hers, in a torturous tension. A state that entered the alliance as a sovereign state and on an equal footing cannot be treated in this way. After the war was a fait accompli, they asked us to lay down our arms with them The Romanian issue in Transylvania dominates the whole situation. If in small things you can get over the public feeling, in the great hours of national life, statesmen must take into account the will of the people. Public opinion can be wrong! A war cannot be waged in today's times if it is not approved by the national conscience! You take shelter behind public opinion! Personal courage has nothing to interfere with the decisions of politicians, Mr. Carp! What dictates the position we support is political reason serving the interests of the country. You all suffered when in 1877 Russia, as a reward for entering the war they took the three remaining counties from Bessarabia! Therefore, you all agreed to the foreign policy line that led us to the Triple Alliance (Central Powers)! And now, do you want to leave this man alone? Once again, follow the line of our traditional policy! Do not lead this country to disaster through sentimentality! I am ready to take charge of the situation! Italy communicated its official position to us. He does not support or get involved in this war. So let's stay neutral. But in the state of defense of our borders. Sire, in the gravest hour, your Majesty was abandoned by all parties and by all his advisers. A decision dictated by the most sacred interests of the country it cannot be interpreted as an act of disloyalty to the sovereign. Gentlemen, I consider myself personally connected to the Central Powers. If you think that Romania's happiness requires it to follow a different international policy from now on I'm ready to retire. By the way, gentlemen, my successor is here. No, uncle. Please, gentlemen, no! I G DUCA-Minister of Cults and Public Instruction The two emperors, Wilhelm of Germany and Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary, ask for my immediate intervention. What can I answer them? Gentlemen? Who is in favor of entering the war with the Triple Alliance? Who is for neutrality? I see that you are not following me. As a constitutional king I submit to your vote. But I fear that you have made a decision that Romania will regret in the future. Congratulations. You spoke like a man of heart and like a statesman. "The King Has Been Abandoned" The king could have declared war on his own. Acceptance of the Crown Council's point of view proved a man's strength of character for whom the old oaths and values ââof democracy were not just words. On a personal level, however, he had suffered a defeat. Only on August 15 will Carol write to Wilhelm II and will explain the situation in which he is. I suffer because of the current situation and the thoughtless state of mind of my country. I cannot start alone without a responsible government a war against which the whole people opposes. On August 3, 1914, England declared war on Germany. And thus, by involving the greatest of the world's empires the European military conflict becomes a global one. In fact, the war was not going too well for the Triple Alliance, but Carol only took seriously the information about Germany's successes. Things were not going very well in the country either. The political current favorable to the Entente manifested itself strongly. Ottokar Czernin, Minister Plenipotentiary of Austria-Hungary in Bucharest had the mission to force the exit from neutrality insistently requesting the activation of the treaty and Romania's entry into the war. This is the pinnacle! He threatens me! I swore allegiance to this country. If she doesn't want to side with Austria-Hungary, what can I do? To betray my people with whom I built the country almost from the beginning? For the Austro-Hungarian minister it was clear that the king was powerless in front of the decision taken. That the treaty was no longer worth anything. That the days he had left to live were a real torture. And simply, the old sovereign was suffering. Then came the battle on the Marne on September 5, 1914. For Carol, this first battle on the Marna river meant a blow that froze him. The French troops had resisted the German attack, repelling it. The game of war had taken over him completely. But his hopes of being a loyal German were dashed by the unexpected French victory. We should all hold hands and so united fly to the heavens away from all the terrors of this dark world. Let the heavens wait I want to live until the end of the war. But the way things are going, I don't think we will have peace until Christmas. You are right, uncle. And I think that the war can last many years. Where is it written that you must catch the end of this war? Can't these things have another end? Mr. Tache Ionescu, I was forced to say No to two emperors with whom I had a treaty. And I have a neutrality treaty with you. From the point of view you supported in the Crown Council. I answer you like the emperors. In one word. Not. Is that really how you met me, in 48 years? Pardon, Your Majesty. However, I think that in the current situation we could reconsider the council's decision. You are wrong, sir. The war is just beginning. On the Marne, the Germans retreated and lost a single battle. With all due respect, sire, Germany suffered a defeat on the Marne. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you are wrong. Life will confirm one or the other. Carol felt viewed with hostility by everyone. Betrayed. The only one who shared and supported his political opinions was Elisabeta. Princess Maria did not hide her feelings, speaking openly for the entry of Romania into the war alongside the Entente and the liberation of Transylvania, Ferdinand being sure under this influence. After so much pressure, on September 16, 1914 Carol asks Basset to prepare the text through which he will inform the Romanian people of his decision to abdicate. In exchange for neutrality towards Russia it undertakes to recognize Romania's right to annex provinces belonging to Austria-Hungary whose population is Romanian. Are you asking me to sign this document? It's just politics, your majesty. They don't hire us. A secret treaty between Romania and Russia? What do we do with the one we signed with Austria Hungary? Towards which we show the same benevolent neutrality, Your Majesty. All politics. I don't trust the Russians, Mr. Bratianu. In '77, I also signed an agreement with them. Among other things, they pledged to respect the integrity of Romania. I commanded the Romanian and Russian army at the siege of Plevna and at the end of the war they did not call us to the table of peace negotiations. They gave me forced residence and were preparing to take me down and they turned the country into a Russian province. Then the army from Craiova and the protection of the great powers saved us. Otherwise now, Russian was spoken here. Even your father suffered three possible Russian attacks. Do you believe me, Mr. Bratianu? Yes, Your Majesty, I know them. I also know the risks of that alliance and the decisions that were taken they were known to you beforehand and yet you accepted them. The Russians then gave us the opportunity to get rid of Turkish suzerainty, to obtain independence and make the Principality a recognized country in Europe. It is. That's how it was. A single road, a common body in which the sovereign and his people shared the same will and the same ideal. Then I was a good Romanian. And now? I sit and honestly wonder if I did the right thing in 1871 by renouncing my abdication. Those are bygone days, Your Majesty. What do you want from me, Mr. Bratianu? Shall I break my word and the principles in which I have believed for a lifetime? I'm not asking that, Your Majesty. I became a stranger to the Romanians again. "A German", as they say. Is the kingdom of Romania today compared to what the country was like when I came in '66? What have I done to you? Sire, you must never question our trust in you. I am here presenting you this treaty, having confidence and conviction that you will understand better than anyone else as in this situation in which we cannot afford anything other than neutrality we must use it to the maximum to support our political interests. As the sovereign of Romania, I will never break my word. I am proud to be German and proud to be the king of Romania. You convinced me. I'm going to climb. The act is a good act for the country. This was his last major political act. October 1, 1914 I am determined to leave if there is a war against Germany. I am convinced that you will be with me. My abdication and that of the Hohenzollern family. I hope you will understand the reasons that brought me here. I understand and I will be fully with you. The opinion that "Uncle" was thinking of abdicating had taken root and had caused a horror in the whole country which was afraid of losing its dynasty. What's up Nandu, what happened? What are you going to do, Uncle? If Uncle abdicated, why did he have to convince my husband to do the same? Romanians, a strong national avant-garde demands that Romania go to war with Austria-Hungary towards the fulfillment of the ideal of the Romanian nation. Unable to resist this trend in which I see a danger for the country, all that remains for me is to entrust the destiny of our homeland to a Royal Lieutenant. I dedicated my whole life to the upliftment and growth of our people. I ask the Almighty to increase him and protect him. The intention to abdicate was a real one and not just a transfer of responsibilities to Ferdinand, the heir to the throne but an abdication of the entire Hohenzollern family. Carol found the strength and did not make the gesture. The homeland will write the names of its brave defenders with gratitude. On the frontispiece of Romania's independence. Do not sleep? What do you say there? How to sleep? Do you still have it? I always wore it. How many years have it been since then? October 13, 1869 in Koln. That's when we met. And on the same day you asked me to be your wife. What could I offer you? I couldn't have chosen better. Are you thinking of Maria, our dear little girl? He was with us for only four years. Then the Lord took it from us. I said harsh words to you that you didn't deserve. How could you think that I, her mother, did not protect her enough from that damn scarlet fever. You shouldn't have doubted me. What does it matter now what I thought then? I didn't tell anyone anything about my troubles, regrets and mistakes, in fact they were enough. I am surrounded by family and I feel more and more alone. I am in my country and yet I am so foreign. Thank you for not leaving me. I would never do it. My dear Carol... Get some rest. King Charles dies on October 11, 1914. The prince and I were in Bucharest. We had to show ourselves to the world to put an end to the rumors that had spread that we were all leaving. Nando slept in Cotroceni and I in Mogosoaia. At Marta Bibescu. In the morning, the prince of Stirbe gave me the news and said: You are the queen! What a stirring emotion! The most overwhelming that I have experienced! A secret door opened over my life, but I didn't feel any fear. Uncle, I know your desire and your will towards the war. I know you would want me to carry it out, but what can a king do against the will of a country? Your hand was heavy, it often pressed my youth You were fair and impartial. I will not forget your teachings, although I hardly listened to them and hardly followed them. Although today you are mute and you can no longer command me I feel you have a message for me, your niece, who once troubled you so much... THE ARRIVAL OF THE MORTUAR TRAIN AT THE MOGOSOIA STATION A creator of modern Romania who lived for the country, but died alone, like a German in foreign lands. He fulfilled his duty to the end. Even death included it among the obligations that belonged to him. She reconciled him with herself, leaving open a path that separated from his convictions. His disappearance generated a feeling of general relief. A strange, barely controlled joy of a nation that saw itself freed from the burden of a titan. He is buried, as he wished, at Curtea de Arges, in the church of the Voivodeship monastery, to whose restoration he had contributed. Two years later, Queen Elizabeth joined him whose last wish was to have with her the earthly remains of the little princess Maria. I lived and die with the same faith in my motto: "NIHIL SINE DEO" NOTHING WITHOUT GOD
