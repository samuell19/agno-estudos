No. ﻿Let me see too. ﻿THE MACALUSO SISTERS ﻿Come with me. ﻿- Why what time is it? - It's late. ﻿What the... Lia!﻿ ﻿You'll break it. ﻿Open it, you bitch, give me my sandwich. I said open it! ﻿Open it, I said! ﻿Where's mine? ﻿Open it! Lia! ﻿Who's that? Cangelosi's here. Aren't we going to the Charleston? ﻿You can stay here. Open the door. ﻿- Was he due today? - Whore! ﻿Yes? ﻿- He wants 80. - Couldn't he have called? ﻿He's coming up. ﻿Come on. ﻿- Good morning, Mr Cangelosi. - Good morning. ﻿- They've asked for 80. - Come in. ﻿Thank goodness you're in. Eighty's a lot, eh? ﻿Careful. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Good morning, Maria. ﻿Put it down here. ﻿Those stairs are steep. ﻿No, that one's broken, sit here. ﻿- Are you getting them? - Yes, they're sorting them out. ﻿Help them out, boys. ﻿- Can they go up? - Of course. ﻿- Can I get you a coffee? - No, thanks. ﻿- A glass of water maybe. - I'll get you one. ﻿I have to go to Monreale. ﻿The service starts at noon. ﻿It'll be a fabulous wedding, though. ﻿With a coach and horses. ﻿Even a band. ﻿Do you want to come? ﻿What for, Mr Cangelosi? ﻿You take some. You have to block its wings or it'll fly away. ﻿You remember I need some pink ones next week? ﻿We've prepared 20 already. ﻿20? I need at least 70, 100 even! ﻿They're paying a fortune. ﻿Two of them died last time. Five.﻿ ﻿Eating coloured food makes them sick. ﻿Okay, but people rarely ask for coloured ones. You'll have to pay for the dead ones. ﻿I'll pay you. It's no big deal. ﻿- Here, take some. - Shall I take that one? ﻿That one has a broken leg, leave it. ﻿Careful. ﻿- Which one should I take? - Take that one, go on. ﻿Hold it from the top or you’ll hurt it. ﻿You have to block their wings, look. See? Or they'll fly away. ﻿- Are you going to the beach? - Yes, to the Charleston. The Charleston? In Mondello? Yes.﻿ ﻿I had a swim there. I'd forgotten about it. ﻿I went to Mondello with my family. My father had a Fiat 600. ﻿What are you doing? Not in the water! Bitch. ﻿I've had enough. ﻿- Can I look over the balcony? - Yes. ﻿You have an amazing view from here, I'm entranced every time I come. ﻿- Get out. You'll wet the clothes. - No. ﻿- I've had enough. - You're hurting my head. ﻿Get out! ﻿When's that cocksucker leaving? ﻿We were going to the Charleston! Bitch! ﻿- Quiet! - Let go! ﻿Big tits! Filthy pig! ﻿Dirty whore! ﻿- We'll wait downstairs. - Okay, we're coming. ﻿Wait, let's feed them. ﻿- Where did you get that? - From the cabinet with the sea on it. ﻿- Does Maria know? - It's a secret. Don't tell her. ﻿She'll be cross. It's the best dinnerware. ﻿The doves have to eat off pretty plates, too. ﻿Let's go. ﻿- Goodbye. - Goodbye. ﻿Come on. ﻿Be careful or you'll fall. ﻿Corne on. ﻿When will you set them free, Mr Cangelosi? ﻿After the ceremony, as usual. ﻿They know their way home, they'll be back by tonight. You look beautiful. ﻿- Aren't you coming to the Charleston? - Put some on me, too. ﻿- You're too little. - Come on! ﻿Only a little, though. ﻿Come here. ﻿Do this. ﻿Let's see. ﻿Let's go. I’ll help you dress. ﻿Come on. ﻿"Everything ends, everything balances out. ﻿You draw a line and sum up the total. ﻿I love life. Perhaps I've loved it too much. ﻿So much so it disgusts me. ﻿That’s enough. ﻿To life, little dove. Let’s drink to life. I ﻿propose a toast to life. ﻿Because I am pleased with myself? I am vile, but pleased with myself, ﻿yet tormented because I am vile. ﻿But I am pleased with myself." ﻿Stop it! ﻿Leave her! ﻿- You've put lipstick on her? - She asked me to. ﻿You're obsessed with make-up, Pinuccia. ﻿- It makes you look ugly. - Listen who's talking! ﻿Hurry up! ﻿- Have you got the sandwiches? - They're here. ﻿Is there any ham in mine? Did you check? ﻿Did Lia eat it? ﻿Pinuccia, I'm talking to you. Did you put ham in mine? ﻿Why? Which one's yours? ﻿Give me the keys. Go on. ﻿- Mine has sesame seeds on it. - They all have. ﻿I'll make my own next time. ﻿- Katia, where's the ball? - Why did I have to bring it? What a pain! Let's get a move on, we have two buses to catch. ﻿Dance for us, Maria! ﻿Now Antonella, too. Look! ﻿It's got real eyes. ﻿- Wow! - This one's scary. ﻿Look, Lia! ﻿What is it? ﻿Nice! ﻿Let's take it. ﻿- Can we do that? - Of course we can, let's go. ﻿- What is it? - An egg. ﻿You want to keep it? It's rubbish! Chuck it. ﻿Pinuccia, vanish! ﻿Yeah, whatever. Come on, hurry up. ﻿Do we have to climb over again? ﻿- Why, do you have a ticket? - No. ﻿Well then? ﻿- Come in! - No, come on, no! - Yes! - No! ﻿Enough! ﻿Stop it! Wait, Maria!﻿ ﻿- I want to dance, too! - And me! ﻿Come on, let's all dance! ﻿Come on, Antonella! ﻿Stay here. Do you want some chocolate? ﻿Can I have a kinder chocolate bar? ﻿That's enough, Maria. ﻿It's bad for her teeth. ﻿Come here. ﻿Look at me. ﻿- This is the last. - Okay. ﻿Do you think he's staring at me? ﻿Who? ﻿The guy with the hair gel. ﻿- That one? - Quiet, you fool! ﻿Lie down! ﻿No, I'm going for a walk. ﻿I'll leave you with him. Hi.﻿ Hi.﻿ ﻿We were late this morning. ﻿It’s boiling hot, too hot for the beach. New bathing costume? ﻿No, it's my sister's. ﻿Which one? ﻿Guess. ﻿Pinuccia's? ﻿How did it go yesterday? ﻿The film was lovely. ﻿I couldn't make it. ﻿I waited for you. ﻿Really? ﻿Yes, really. ﻿It's on again on Tuesday. ﻿Will you come? ﻿Will you wait for me again? Katia!﻿ ﻿Pinuccia! - ﻿Lia! - Lia! ﻿It was your turn to call. ﻿It's a stupid game. ﻿- Where are you going? - To the Charleston. ﻿- You can't climb up, it's forbidden! - We'll do it this time. ﻿Come on. ﻿Ready? ﻿It's too high, you can't reach. ﻿- Climb on my shoulders. - You're so stubborn. ﻿Ready? ﻿Me, too! ﻿No, not you. Come here. ﻿No, Antonella! ﻿Enough! ﻿Let's try again. ﻿- Me too! - No, not you! Stop it! ﻿Ready? ﻿Just stop that! ﻿- I'll take Antonella. - No. ﻿- Come on. - It's too high for her. ﻿She'll manage, don't worry. I’ll see to her, you can go. ﻿- Help me. - Help me, Katia. ﻿Come on... ﻿- Katia, get her down. - We’re having fun, Pinuccia. ﻿- I'm going for a swim. - Can you do it? ﻿- Come on! Ready? - Yes! - Wait! ﻿- Come on, get on! ﻿- Lia, I've done it! - Well done! ﻿It's the guy with the crazy friend, ﻿a crazy scientist ﻿who has built a time machine, and he takes him for a ride. ﻿Can you imagine? ﻿He goes back to before he was born, meets his mother as a young girl ﻿and she falls in love with him. ﻿So he might not be born, ﻿because if his mum's in love with him, how can he be born? ﻿Who would his mum have him with? ﻿Wait, you've lost me. ﻿- Who? - Him! ﻿So he has to persuade his mother to marry his father. or he'll vanish from the photo. Get it? Yes.﻿ ﻿I want to be a dancer. ﻿Will you come and watch me? ﻿Every evening. ﻿Really? ﻿Yes, really. ﻿Pinuccia! ﻿Katia! ﻿- Wait. - What is it? ﻿Wait, hear that? ﻿- Ignore it, come here. - No, it's that bitch. ﻿She's got in. ﻿Let me see if I’ve left the keys in the lock. ﻿Let me fondle your tits. ﻿Yeah... - Please, just a second. - You drive me wild. Turn over. Turn over. You're mine. ﻿Mine, all mine! I want more. That's right. You like that? Yeah.﻿ I want it all! I want it all! All of it! ﻿Why's it taking so long, you whore? ﻿Have you finished? ﻿Can I come up now? ﻿It's really disgusting. Antonino, stop it. ﻿- Can I come too, Mum? - You stay with Dad. ﻿They must give you at least 30,000. ﻿- It's your share. - They have no money. ﻿Then you'll have to sell the fucking house. ﻿Persuade that crazy sister of yours. ﻿Lia won't sell it. ﻿But it belongs to the four of you, even if it's in her name. ﻿It's your inheritance, you do realise that? ﻿But the house isn't worth 120,000. ﻿That's because it's filthy with those fucking pigeons. ﻿Those doves fed us for years. ﻿Yes, but what do you make from them now? ﻿At least get some rent off them, a monthly sum. ﻿We'll take the pigeons. We'll put them in the garage. ﻿You have to convince them, Katia. ﻿Don't let them push you around. ﻿Do you want me to talk to them? ﻿It's not up to you, I'll see to it. ﻿Hear that, Antonine? Your mother will see to it. ﻿Oh, Maria, it's you! How are things? Better today. ﻿- You didn't come yesterday? - No, I got someone to stand in. ﻿Did you speak to the head physician at Candela Clinic? ﻿Yes, he says hello. ﻿And? ﻿No luck. He told me the same thing. ﻿But thanks for putting me in contact with him. ﻿He was very kind. Yes, he's a good doctor, too. ﻿HEART ﻿WHAT SHALL I BRING? ﻿MIGNON PASTRIES MOREOVER WITH KIWI FRUIT ﻿Is it working? ﻿There's an awful stink in here. ﻿They repaired it last week. ﻿Not very well. ﻿I'll send you the number of another colleague in Verona. ﻿I'd try talking to him, too. ﻿I'll call him first. ﻿Thank you, doctor. ﻿- Have you finished? - Yes, that's enough for today. ﻿You go home, too. ﻿See you Monday. ﻿I'll clean up first. ﻿Have a nice evening. ﻿"I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. ﻿When I was here last ﻿I tore my gown on a chair. ﻿And he asked me my name and address... ﻿inside of a week ﻿I got a package from Croirier's with... ﻿a new evening gown in it." Lia! Why don't you get that? ﻿I’m busy. ﻿So am I. ﻿Why do you leave the keys inside? What do I need these for? ﻿Hello, Katia. ﻿I've made the "fake fish." ﻿- Did you get the kiwi ones? - They'd sold out. I got the ones with peaches. ﻿You're teasing! ﻿Of course I got you kiwi ones! ﻿Put them in the fridge, I'll do this. ﻿It's not my day today. ﻿- What's up? - I've broken a plate. ﻿I’m sorry. ﻿Never mind. ﻿Here. We’ve got loads of plates. ﻿Why the best dinner set? ﻿Maria wanted to use it. ﻿Don't help me, eh? ﻿- Hi Katia. - I broke a plate. ﻿There's no room in the fridge. As ﻿long as we have enough. ﻿Where shall I put them? We have to eat off our best plates tonight. ﻿How's Antonino? ﻿As naughty as ever. ﻿You're all sweaty. ﻿I’m hot. Get the water. ﻿No, from the fridge. ﻿The tub is full. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Here you are. ﻿It's turned out well, eh? ﻿Nice. ﻿Hurry up, it's nearly ready. ﻿Katia! ﻿You'll spoil it! ﻿- Where's the tablecloth with the roses? - Here. ﻿Why don't we use this one? It's more cheerful. ﻿I'm hungry. I'm putting the pasta in. ﻿I need a pee, may I? Why this dinner? ﻿I'll tell you after we've eaten. ﻿Hurry up, I'm hungry. ﻿Dinner's ready! ﻿You're stupid, totally stupid. ﻿- I was joking, Pinuccia. - It's not funny. ﻿Cut that out! ﻿I'm fed up. I’m always busy with my son. ﻿His father doesn't help. ﻿All he does is torment me. ﻿On the way here in the car, he kept going on about the house. ﻿My life'll never change! ﻿Pinuccia, are you listening? ﻿Your husband's more like a child than your son. ﻿What's that got to do with it? Okay, when you've finished, we can talk. ﻿Pass me that banana. ﻿Maria! ﻿What shall we do with this house? ﻿My husband's tormenting me. ﻿You have to help me find a solution. ﻿What solution? ﻿Shall we move out? ﻿You'd do me a favour. ﻿Here. ﻿Let's clear upstairs. ﻿What do you need pigeons for? They only dirty. ﻿They keep coming back! Do you want to kill them? ﻿Wall the windows up? ﻿- Who'd buy a house in this state? - What state? ﻿Don't get offended, Pinuccia. ﻿We made a living off them once, but not now. ﻿- My husband's insisting. - What’s it to him? ﻿Don't keep on about it, he's not the problem. ﻿Maria, what do you say? ﻿The pigeons don't bother me. ﻿They keep me company. ﻿And we should, too. ﻿Stand by each other. What are you doing? ﻿Clearing the table. ﻿Give me my phone. ﻿See that? Hey? Not yet. ﻿Wait. Yes.﻿ ﻿Okay, bye. Bye.﻿ ﻿Maria, what's up? ﻿You look pale, what's wrong? ﻿Nothing. ﻿What happened? ﻿Nothing. ﻿That's not true, she's sick. ﻿I'm okay. I'll just go in the bathroom. ﻿On my own! ﻿Maybe it’s something she ate. ﻿She didn't eat anything. ﻿She’s stopped eating. ﻿She's worn out. ﻿While others eat like pigs. I only cook for her these days. ﻿I know how Maria feels. ﻿I find it disgusting eating next to her, too. ﻿You couldn't care less about us. ﻿You cook only for your boyfriend. ﻿- Has Marco moved in now? - Almost. ﻿- Mind your own business. - Mind my own business? ﻿When you lock me out when you're screwing, whose business is it? ﻿Look what an expert she is! ﻿Carry on! ﻿You wish, eh? ﻿Look at her. ﻿I want it all! ﻿All of it! ﻿You're really good. ﻿Have you been practicing? ﻿You're really good. ﻿Pity it’s all a sham. ﻿You'll never know what it really feels like. ﻿Because no one wants you. ﻿You're crazy! Leave me alone. ﻿And this is mine! ﻿Look at her staring at me, she's a raving lunatic! - I'll kill her. - Stop it, Lia, please. ﻿- I'll kill her. - Stop it! ﻿She spies on me, rummages in my drawers. She doesn't knock. ﻿- You'll have to move out! - And leave her on her own? ﻿Think what she'd get up to! ﻿You’re all talk. You moved out and left her with me. ﻿- I got married and had a kid. - You didn't give a fuck. ﻿Get out of here, damn it! ﻿You're always in the way. Out! ﻿She's a whore, a bitch. ﻿She cares only about herself, to hell with anyone else. - Because it's worth her while. - Calm down. ﻿I've brought you a book. ﻿Let's sell the house, we'll persuade Lia. ﻿You can go to Marco’s and my husband will leave me alone. ﻿Where would she go? ﻿This house will never sell ﻿and she will cling to me for the rest of my life. ﻿What will I tell him tonight when I get back? ﻿Please yourselves. ﻿I'm going to have a screw! ﻿A nice screw with my guy. "One day I looked around me and saw that the world was being born, too. ﻿Mountains were being born, ﻿rivers, clouds... pale figures..." ﻿Know why that madwoman is always taking my phone? ﻿She looks at Marco's selfies. ﻿Ignore her. ﻿She's got a crush. ﻿- "And I rarely saw this landscape blue..." - She fell in love, the useless thing! ﻿"An intense blue that tore me apart. ﻿It was usually grey, it was winter." ﻿Marco and I fucking die laughing. ﻿Stop it, Pinuccia. ﻿Stop it. I don't give a damn about you all. You don't listen to me anyway, you never have. ﻿Right? ﻿What do you mean'? ﻿If you'd listened to me, things would've been different. Even this... this house... ﻿She would’ve been different, too. What should I have done? Let's hear it. ﻿You should have stopped her. ﻿We should have swam out together, to look at the fish. It was such a lovely day.﻿ We were playing. ﻿We were kids. It was her fault. ﻿We all know it was her fault. ﻿I’m not listening to this. ﻿Cursed Lia! ﻿Cursed Lia! I'm going home. ﻿Wait, Katia! ﻿Please, take her with you. ﻿Please, take her with you. ﻿What the fuck are you saying, you bitch? ﻿Stop it! ﻿It's my house! ﻿Curse you! It's all your fault! It﻿'s all your fault, curse you! ﻿My head, you're hurting me! ﻿You ruined our lives! ﻿I want you out of here, booted out! ﻿Oh God! ﻿Booted out! ﻿Bastard! ﻿To work on the street as a whore! ﻿You ruined my life! ﻿Get out, Pinuccia! ﻿Get out, Pinuccia! ﻿I'll kill you. ﻿Whore! ﻿Stop it! ﻿Stop it! ﻿You ruined all our lives! ﻿Curse you! ﻿Get out, Pinuccia! ﻿It's all your fault! ﻿You should have died instead! ﻿You should have died! ﻿Fuck off! I've got cancer. ﻿Katia! ﻿Pinuccia! - ﻿Lia! - Lia! ﻿- It was your turn to call. - It's a stupid game. ﻿- Where are you going? - To the Charleston. ﻿- You can't climb up, it's forbidden! - We'll do it this time. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Come on. ﻿Ready? ﻿Ready? ﻿Me too, me too! ﻿Enough! ﻿Come here or you'll drown. ﻿- I’ll take Antonella. - No, it’s too high for her. ﻿She'll manage, don't worry. ﻿I'll see to her, you can go. ﻿Ready? ﻿- Katia, get her down. - We’re having fun, Pinuccia. ﻿- Try. - Okay, I'm going for a swim. ﻿Give me a hand. ﻿Come on, climb up! ﻿I'm doing it, Lia! - Wait! - Get on.﻿ ﻿Go on! Come on, get on! ﻿- Lia, I've done it! - Well done! ﻿"I think of animals as little people. ﻿A kind of sibling to humans. ﻿Creatures with a face. ﻿Beautiful, and kind eyes that express a thought ﻿and a quiet sensitivity, ﻿but with the same worth as human sensitivity and thought. ﻿These little people are pure and kind. ﻿They aren't greedy. ﻿They know neither accumulation nor waste. ﻿They take care of their young ﻿and are a precious help to man. ﻿In the past they fed him. ﻿raised him, covered him, ﻿just like mothers do. ﻿They kept him company. ﻿There was no one to comfort him on this Earth. ﻿A special family, dogs started protecting him ﻿and millions of times they have died for him. ﻿Birds, another family of angelic origin, ﻿sang for him in the depths of the forests, ﻿reminding him that heaven had not forgotten him. ﻿And heaven, ﻿he knew instinctively ﻿was his origins." ﻿You look beautiful. Yes.﻿ ﻿You can take the furniture when I hand over the keys. ﻿Of course. We can hand it over to you now, Mr Scuderi. ﻿Tomorrow at 8 a.m.? ﻿Okay. ﻿The funeral's at 10. ﻿Thank you. ﻿We'll expect you. Goodbye. ﻿Come on, hurry up! As soon as you've finished, lock up. ﻿Okay, Mr Scuderi. ﻿Goodbye. We have to tie things up properly. ﻿Or we'll damage it. I know what has to be done. Let me talk to them. - Let me see to it. - Wait. ﻿Just a moment. ﻿Come here. ﻿We have to take this cabinet out, it’ll go on the hoist. Grab that end. ﻿Come on. That's right. ﻿- Have you got the keys? - Yes. ﻿Let's go then. ﻿Come on, get on! ﻿- I've done it! - Are you there? - Yes! - Well done!﻿ ﻿- Wait. - Get on! ﻿Come on! ﻿I'm doing it! ﻿- Lia, I've done it! - Well done! ﻿Hey, kid! ﻿Antonella! No! ﻿THE MACALUSO SISTERS
