(MultiCom Jingle) ("I'd Like to Be in Nashville" by Jesse Turner plays) - What are you two doin' now? You're both fired. - Fired? What do you mean fired, we quit! (horn honking) Got your clean shirt, JD, hair is sure lookin' good. I can't understand how you stay so calm, JD. - I never wanna work for that idiot again, ever, ever! - I think you're gonna get your wish, JD. - Well, I'll tell you one thing. That was our lucky break getting fired from that job. - Lucky, how can ya? - That's right, lucky. - How can you say that, JD? Now we've been fired so many places and so many times round here well, there ain't no place to get fired from. - Good, that's the best news I've heard yet. You got a couple bucks on ya. Here ya go Chuck, keep the change. Help me with my shirt, kid. - I understand how you feel, JD but we could've used the money. - We never worried about money before. - How could we? We never had any. - Come on, Kid. See ya, Chuck, come on, quit worryin'. Besides, we got the big concert tonight. - Ah, come on, JD. - It's showtime. (twangy music) (applause) - Ya'll havin' fun? (whispering inaudibly) Listen, I know all this dancin' is makin' ya thirsty. So we're gonna give ya a break here and wet your whistle while you listen to those two ever popular local boys JD and Salt Fly kid, so without further ado, I'd like to introduce that song writer, singer, picker and grinner, JD Todd and his partner the Salt Fly kid. What, what, don't forget the money. Andy asked if ya'll really be generous when the hat comes around, we'd appreciate it. (applause) What are you doin' dancin' with Cutter's girl?

(intense music) - Evenin' boys. - How much do you reckon we managed to pick up off the floor, kid? - Well, I got about $8 not counting the dimes and pennies. I reckon I didn't do too bad considering we only got through about half the song. - You did better than me, I only got $7.52. - We ain't gonna make it as singers at this rate. - Ah, it ain't so bad, we still got our leftover pay with this, I figure, we got a little over 80 bucks. - A pleasant good evening to you, gentlemen. - Howdy. - Hey. - Tyrone T Sullivan here, at your service. I don't believe I caught your handle. - I'm JD Todd and this here's the Salt Flat Kid. - The Salt Flat kid, Todd, I assure you the pleasure is all mine, gentlemen, my card. - Nashville. - You're from Nashville. - That's right, Nashville. - Are you in like it says here, an artist manager? - You've heard of Mickey Gilley, Freddie Fender, the Immortal Marty Robins, Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn. - You manage all them folks? - Each and every one of those people carry my card. As a matter of fact, I'm here on a business arrangement right now for the great Chett Atkins. - You reckon you could help us? - I don't see why not, I helped them, didn't I? - Sure would appreciate it. - Yes sir. - Well, if I could settle with that Sheriff, I could get on the telephone and arrange with those great Nashville talents to help you up the staircase to the stairs. - You mean the Grand? - The Grand Ole Opry, that's right, son. But there's a matter of say $20, without that I'm completely helpless. - Mr Sullivan, would this help, would this help ya? - Gentlemen, a wise investment in an unlimited future. Now all that remains for me, come morning is to make a few strategic phone calls, some words to the wise and JD and the Salt Flat kid will be launched. - Thanks. - We appreciate it. - Todd, Kid, come on out, believe it or not, there's no damages reported last night. I'm gonna give you boys a head start on. (intense music) - What happened to Mr Sullivan? - He paid his fine and left. - Great. (rooster crowing) - Well, here we are folks, them two superstars, JD Todd and the Salt Flat Kid, back from another successful engagement in the grits room of the county jail, Stump, Texas. - Don't make fun of the jail, I kinda like it. - JD, the food's terrible and you know it. - You reckon that Tyrone fella knew what he was talkin' about? - He did know all them stars. - How far is it to Nashville? - Nashville, now it's too far for us. - Get a map, kid. - JD, come on. - Get a map. - Sit right here. JD's got another scheme. Looky there JD, that's over 1,000 miles. - It aint but that far on the map. - It's still too far, we shouldn't do it. - Why, we got the talent and now we finally got somebody that's gonna help us, why shouldn't we do it? You wanna spend another night in the county jail? - I reckon you're right. No one seems to be helpin' us here, why not? Give me that map, I'll find a way to Nashville. - Now you're talkin' kid, come on. - Goodbye smelly honky tonks and beer bar bosses! - Goodbye hairy legged women! - Goodbye lonesome nights! - Goodbye county jail! - Goodbye Salt Flat, Texas! - Nashville, here we come!

You cowboys seen two girls? - Why, what's up? - Kidnappin', that's what. Some fool run off with my fiance. They're not gonna get too far though. My uncle's got road blocks up from here to Nashville. - Road blocks? - That's right. My uncle's the Sheriff of Nashville. He don't take too kindly to kidnapping. - Kidnapping? - Why else would she run off? We supposed to get married next week. - What do these two girls look like? - I'll tell you my fiance, Sandy, she's blonde, beautiful, real pretty girl, the other one's a red head. The one she runs with, kinda looks like a cock roach or something like that. Looks like that boy in there's kinda thick in the head, is he? - Well in a manner of speaking. - Yeah, I'll tell you what though. Now take heart to this, I've been readin' them science magazines and they do medical miracle every day. Somethin' new come along, he'll be alright. - There they go! - What? - Those two girls, with that guy in that car. Come on, let's help, come on, here we go! (intense music) Hurry up, let's go, come on. - What's the matter? - [Kid] Sandy, we just met your fiance. - Fiance, how dare he call himself her fiance? Look, Sandy was playing a club in Memphis and that animal Arthur came in and took a liking to her. Well, that's no big deal, everybody who sees Sandy on stage takes a liking to her but Arthur kept coming in night after night, Sandy felt sorry for him. She brings home stray dogs, it's like living with the Salvation Army. She wants to save the world, anyway, Arthur kept pushing this clunker car on her. She didn't want it but no Dumbo insisted. So she took it but believe me, there were strings attached. Arthur came down heavy, Sandy had to marry him or else. We had to run for our lives. We had to use the old clunker car to do it. - Is that true, Sandy? - Would I lie to you? - No, ma'am. (intense music) Misery, look at that. - Uh oh. - [Sandy] I guess he does have an uncle that's the Sheriff. - [Kid] They're lookin' for someone, I'll bet it's us. (intense music) - What seems to be the problem, officer? - Long haired hippie freaks, that's what the problem is. Kidnappers, murderers, stick up men, thieves, no pushers, wife stealers, gamblers, shiesters, lone sharks. That's the problem, peepin' toms, panders, falanders, pot heads, howdy do ma'am, Texas cowboys and pick up trucks that oughta be scrapped on, my hate list. - What list is that, Sheriff? - My hate list, buster. Boys lookin' kind of nervous. I don't reckon either one of ya's got a driver's license. - Yeah, right here, here it is, sir. - Where you boys headin'? - We're gonna go to Nashville. - To get on the Grand Ole Opry? - That's right. - Yes, sir. - These your bags? - Yes sir, that's our bags. - Texans, if the Indians were to attack today, they'd probably take her and never even fire an arrow. Why don't you two sweet things back home on the range where ya belong? - Truth is Sheriff, the Sheriff back home was wondering why we didn't just move along. - Right and Nashville came highly recommended by friend. - Well, your friend was wrong, if you picked a guitar like Roy Clark, sang like Johnny Cash, looked like Dolly Parton, you'd still be wrong. This here town's full of singin' cowboys. And they're all washin' cars or fryin' hamburgers and finger lickin' chicken, I'm a human polygraph. You tell me a line, I spot it like that. A big Whopper or a little white one, don't make no difference to me, what'd you do with the girls? - To tell you the truth, Sheriff, I can't remember the last time we did anything with a girl. - I don't reckon you can. Here and get out of my sight, drive it. Boy, I know times a changed but I don't believe the Grand Old Opry is ready for a couple of soprano cowboys just yet, come on, come on. - I'm gettin' that old feelin', JD. - What feelin's that kid. - A hankering to turn around and get on back home to Salt Flat, Texas, I believe this outside world's dangerous. - I don't remember anybody tellin' us it was gonna be easy. (intense music) Get ready, kid. (pleasant music) How ya doin', sir? - What can I get you? - I just wanna tell you about this bad radiator you get there in the trunk. - I gotta stop and look at that. - Come on, I'll help you. - Thank you. - Come on, watch. - These radiators, you don't know what to do. - That's a nice old car, you take good care of it. - Well, it's all I got, I have to keep it. - Yeah, let me show you where it is. It's leakin' pretty bad right up under there. Can you see that with me? - That's what it is. - Right there, see that leak? - Yeah, what the? - Sir, you oughta look at the rest of this. (intense music) - Thanks for the ride. - What in the blazes those two girls doin' here? - Beats me, I think he got 'em out of your rumble seat. - My rumble seat? - Yes sir, I think so. When's the last time you looked back there. - It's been some time, I have to look at it more. - I'll tell you what, if I was you, I'd start lookin' back there more often. - Thank you very much. - Good luck to you, sir, much obliged. (intense music) - All clear. (engine running) - What's the trouble, old timer? - Sheriff, I guess you better take me in. I think I was asleep at the wheel. I was gettin' along fine, I think and then the next thing I know these cowboys came along and started pullin' girls out of my rumble seat. - Texas cowboys. - That's what the plate said. - I was the one that got caught nappin'. (intense music) (sirens) - My goodness, what's gonna happen next? (sirens) (intense music) - Hold on! (intense music) (train horn honking) (intense music) - [Man On Radio] Uncle Calvin, coming in, Uncle Calvin. This is Arthur, Uncle Calvin, come in, Uncle Calvin. - Yeah, go ahead. - Uncle Calvin, is it you? - Who you think it is, Johnny Cash? - [Man On Radio] Uncle Calvin, I just wanted to tell you your hamburger's gettin' cold. - Not any colder than your brain, you! - Settle down, Kid, just 22 miles and we'll be home safe. - Safe, now how do you figure that? Kidnapping's a serious charge and we aint in Salt Flat, Texas, this is Tennessee, lord knows what they do to you for kidnapping here. - Yeah but no one was kidnapped. - I'm tellin' ya, that Sheriff back there is mean. And he don't like Texans, just some throw us in jail, throw away the key and then just hang us out to dry. - Look, no one was kidnapped, we came of our own free will. We're the kidnappees. - Would ya'll relax? Just relax. (sirens) - Siren, JD, they got us! - They ain't got us, yet! Hang on! (screams) - I told ya, hurry it up, hurry it up or we're going back to jail, come on! (sirens) - It's only an ambulance. - We knew it was just an ambulance. - We're just trickin' ya, hurt your leg? - Yeah. - Yeah. (laughing) What a trick, huh? (horses neighing) (intense music) - Sandy, you know what I was just thinkin'? See those horses out there? 35 years, my life's been just like that. I just run around and round in circles and I don't ever seem to go anyplace. - Who does? - I know that. But there's gotta be more to life than that. It's the reason I left Salt Flat. - Salt Flat, is that really a place? - Yeah, that's the only place that's no place. - That's where you met your friend, isn't it? - Yeah, yeah, he and I failed third grade together. At least we do one thing well together. We play, sing, that makes people happy and I guess that's what it's all about. - So now you're off to Nashville to be a big star, right? - Being a big star but I really would like to sing in the Grand Ole Opry, sing to all those people. - You think it's possible? - I'm gonna try real hard. - Boy, you really have that show biz bone. - Thanks, what about you? - There's not much to talk about, I'm sort of like you, I'm just lookin' for my place. - Don't you like bein' a dancer? - Oh, I like it, it's the only thing I have to hold onto. But it gets lonely. - I can't imagine you getting lonely. - Well traveling around from place to place, workin' late every night, you don't really get a chance to meet someone special or to form a real relationship. (intense music) - Hey kid, you got the most adorable dummy I've ever seen. - Thank you. - Where'd you get him? - Bought him from an old ventriloquist who's down and out. - Were you always interested in show business? - Well yeah but before JD and I did a little rodeo, well JD got hurt and quit and I just went along. - I can't imagine what kind of show business they have in Salt Flat. - Well, we had three bars we played at, the VFW hall. We played a lot at the boy's gymnasium. - Scared about going to Nashville? - Scared, truth is, I haven't been but about 10 miles out of Salt Flat and well, I expect they'll be a lot more people in Nashville lookin' at us than there are the whole city of Salt Flat. The truth is this is all new to me. - You're scared. - Yeah. Excuse me, hey, we're ready, let's move 'em out.

We figured well, we'll settle up with ya later. - Right. - Well that's mighty sportin' of ya. Well, how about it, then, do you wanna come down? - Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, we sure do. - Come on down. - Can we? - I'm sure no friend of Sheriff Letty. And I didn't figure you for a couple of kidnappers or tire snatchers, everybody knows that every junkyard has got a guard dog and so I'm not gonna turn ya in until after you've had your breakfast. Settle down, fellas, I'm not gonna have you locked up. I know what show business is all about. - You sure know the big ones, ma'am. - They're all my friends. - Really? - Sure, I've seen them all come to town with stars in their eyes and nothin' in their pockets. - What happens to 'em? - Sometimes they make it and sometimes they don't. - We're gonna make it, we already got us a manager. - What junkyard is he rippin' off now? - No ma'am, he's back in Texas doin' some work for Chett Atkins. - And in the meantime, what are you fellas gonna be doin'? Snatching tires? - No ma'am. - Look, listen to an old lady. You can't go drivin' through Nashville in your beat up old pick up truck and waltz out onto the stage of the Grand Ole Opry. - No ma'am. We've learned that. - You got to have experience. - It seems like we've been gettin' a lot of that lately. - You've got to have more and the right people have got to see ya and hear ya. - How would we get to meet the right people? - The ones that make it big have an agent and that's what you fellas need, an agent. But in the meantime, sit down and let me get some food ready for ya. - Thank you ma'am. Thank you. - Thank you. (horn honking) Can you believe it, we come 2,000 miles to get on the Grand Ole Opry and we can't even get an audition? - Yeah, well don't worry about it, I'll figure out something, come on.

Some lunch. - No thank you. - [Mr Buffy] Bring the boys some coffee. - No, that's okay. - Marcy told me you do a great act. - Well, we work hard. - How long you been in Nashville? - [JD] A couple of days, we were up in Texas. - I need about 30 minutes, you think I could handle it. - Yeah, you bet we can, JD's written so many songs, it'd take us about two hours to get through 'em all. - Ned, Big Bob Buffy here again, two hot out from Texas just stopped by, I think I can get 'em to your show tonight. What, $75, are you kidding. - We'll take it, Mr Buffy. We'll take it, we'll take it. - Quiet. I couldn't offer 'em that amount, it would be an insult. 100, well okay, you get them. (cheering) Take it easy, it's only a fill in date. - I'll tell ya, Mr Buffy, that 100's gonna come in mighty handy. - What 100? What about my commission? - I'm sorry I forgot. - What do you think I'm running here, charity? I got overhead, I got expenses. Here's how it works, I get half, that leaves you with 50. You have to pay Ned 25. - Who's Ned? - He's the manager, now you got that $50 to me, $25 to Ned leaves you with $25, what do ya say, a deal? - Yes sir. - Your check sir. - Thank you JD, that's class. You can always tell a man by his actions. It's those little moments of initiative that make the difference being nobody and being somebody. Let me tell you, JD, you are a somebody. Hey, it'll be my pleasure to buy lunch on your big day. What are you gonna wear, you got some cowboy rhinestone duds? - No sir, this is all we have. - No way, this is a high class club. My acts have style, you two had better get yourselves some better looking clothes if you wanna work this job. - Yes sir, we will. - Here's my card. You come to the office about six o'clock and I'll give you the directions, okay. Now get yourself some nice clothes. (twangy music) - What do you figure happened to all these folks had these guitars? - I don't know. Go back to Salt Flat or some place just like it. - They got a bunch of 'em, different colors, shapes and sizes. (chatter) - What'd ya got? - Brooch. - Rich people don't come in here. What'd you gotta hawk? - Somethin' special. - Betcha aint got one of those. - What's his name? - Andy. - Hey, that's good, but what am I gonna do with a dummy? I got enough weirdness around here. Take a look at that, 20 years ago I bought it. 20 years I'm trying to sell that and I'll have better luck with it than with your dummy. - You mean we can't get any money? - What am I gonna do with a doll? - Not a doll, a dummy. - If you say so, you're a dummy. - Look sir, we just got our first booking and we need some money for some clothes. - Oh, you need clothes, well.

I always thought about takin' art. I got a little bit of talent. Let me see now, put some more sideburns on that little guy. Yeah, let me see the big guy one more time now. I think he had a cowboy hat or something, maybe, it was a cowboy hat, yeah, put that on there, good. That's it, that's it, that looks good, that's real good. Hey Uncle Calvin, I think we got it here. Little guy with the bushy sideburns, I do remember that. The big guy had on a cowboy hat or something like that. What do you think? Little guy with the sideburns and you see the bigger guy. - Now what would you think if you was lookin' at an idiot? - What'd I do now? - That don't look anything like 'em, Arthur. The little one was a lot fatter than that. And the tall one was skinner. With that you got the mustache on the little one and it was on the big one. - I didn't draw it, Uncle Calvin. - You wouldn't know what you was lookin' at if you was gazin' in the mirror. Don't back me, boy, we gotta catch them cowboys! Now get back over there and do it again! Get to work! (mumbling) (pleasant music) (chatter) (piano music) (squeaking music) - Okay, okay, that's enough, okay. I'll get back to you guys, okay. - Sure do appreciate it, Mr Buffy. - Don't mention it, don't mention it, come here. Sit down and relax guys. Take your money from Saturday. - Mr Buffy, I wonder if we might talk to you for a minute, sir. - Yeah, why not? - Sir, this $25 we're making on the job is just not enough. We made more than that back in Salt Flats. - This aint Salt Flat, it's Nashville. - Yes sir, I know that but you see, $25 that's just not enough to live on here in Nashville. - You guys are all the same. You come here hungry, few days go by, you get the wrinkles out of your belly and then suddenly you're too good for the club. - No sir, it's not that, its just that well, we don't think it's fair that the club manager gets half of our pay. - We want $50 if that's what we earned. - Nobody tells me how to run my business. - We're not trying to tell ya how to run your business. Mr Buffy, we're not trying to get personal. - Not personal, listen sonny, I'm not gonna let a second rate cowboy act take me. - Wait a minute. - I don't need you. Acts like you are a dime a dozen. Yeah that's right, go on, get outta here, go on. Get out, get out, get out, go on, go on. See if you do any better, see how many agents will bother with a couple of armatures from Texas. Go on, keep movin' you ingrates, get out of my site. I don't wanna ever see you guys again. Don't you ever come crawlin' around here. Tell Marcy not to ever call me again. If you take my advice, you'll stay out of Nashville. Go on! Hey you two, come back here. Come back here for a minute, huh? Come on, come on. (intense music) Stand up, I'm sorry I yelled at you guys. I got an ulcer, 33 years of booking these joints. Believe me, I hate them as much as you. But that's the only way, they start ya. You gotta start somewhere, no shortcuts. I know what I mean, I don't kid myself. I'm a small time agent. They go on to pay off the managers. That's the only way I could get you in. I mean, pay and play, why do I allow it? 'Cause I dream some day of being someone. I dream that one day one of my acts will make it. Maybe even you, then I'll get a call and they'll say Bob, I want you to handle my business. I'll be talking the big deals and living the good life. And that's why I hustle these joints. 'Cause I believe that one day Big Bob Buffy will have himself a star. (intense music) - Mr Buffy. - Yes. - You think we're Armature hour cowboys? - Do you? - No sir, I don't. - Then prove it, work, work.

One week you bring in the dummy, a week goes by, you take the dummy back, another week goes by and you bring the dummy back in, what's goin' on? - I don't know, it's like whatever we do, it turns out wrong, I don't know if we'll ever get to where we wanna go. - Where do you wanna go? - Well, the Grand Ole Opry. - Oh you and half of Nashville. It's like a disease. - I know it's difficult. - Difficult, yes, impossible, no. - [JD] You know somebody with the Grand Ole Opry? - There's only one way to get on the Grand Ole Opry. You have to make a record. Then they call you, you don't have to call them. - Really? - Yeah. You see that guitar over here. Belonged to Marty Robins, gave him 10 bucks for it. Month goes by, his record comes out, the rest is history. I wouldn't take 1,000 bucks for that now. Makes me part of history too. - Record, huh? - Yeah, that's right. It's a demo, that's what it's called, a demo. You have to make a demo. - You think maybe we could. - Definitely. You have to make a demo, that's it. You have to make a demo. - Kid, give Mr Friedman the dummy. - What? - Come on. Give Mr Friedman the dummy. - What? - Come on, give Mr Friedman the dummy. I'll explain later, come on, come on. - JD, now wait a minute. - Come on. - That's show business, Andy. (intense music) - Hey partner, where we gonna get the money to make that record? - I don't know but I'll figure out. - Do you believe that? (intense music) - Hey, what's the name of that town where they have those rodeos? - Franklin. (intense music) - Hey. - Can I help ya, cowboy? - Yeah, this is where I sign up? - This is the place, which event? - Which one's payin' the most? - Bull ridin'. - Bull ridin'. - Sign here, partner. (horses neighing) (intense music) Good luck, cowboy. - Thank you. - Hey JD. - Hey kid. I got you a number. - It's a lucky one. - Oh yeah, got a good day, huh? - I don't know JD, it's been a long time. - Don't be humble with me, champ. I've seen your belt buckle, remember? - Being champ in Salt Flat isn't exactly big time, JD. Besides, I had to stop wearin' that buckle. It's turnin' my belly green. - You're the one ridin' that bull, Hurricane, aren't ya? - Yeah, I reckon. - Good luck. - Good luck. (upbeat music) - Want some ice cream, kid? - JD, what's this about a bull called Hurricane? - Sure you don't want some ice cream? - JD. (intense music) (mooing) - It pays the most and we need the money to make that record, you were the champ in Salt Flat, Texas. - Being champ in Salt Flat, Texas, I was broke bustin'. This is a bull ridin'. - Kid, do you wanna be at the Grand Ole Opry or not? - You know I do, JD. - Well, you're gonna have to ride this bull, come on. - [Announcer] And now ladies and gentlemen, we move to shoot number eight, shoot number eight, we have cowboy number 208, better known as the Salt Flat Kid. - Kid, you don't have to do this if you don't want to. It's up to you. - The things I do for our career, sometimes I don't believe it. - Alright, let's let her rip. (intense music) (jeering) - [Announcer] Good ride for the Salt Flat Kid. But only seven seconds, not enough to qualify. (applause) (soft music) - I aint got it, old Hurricane just pounded some sense into me, I kinda forgot I was just a country boy. I thought I could whip Nashville but it aint gonna be. Put that dream next to old Andy and all those guitars in the hawk shop and forget it. I'm draggin' ya down, JD. I'm a loser now, I know that. You do better on your own. I'm going back to Texas. (soft music) - Ah, my two stars, how are ya? - We're not so good. - Did you make your record? - No, I suspect we're gonna be goin' home. - Home? - Yeah. Say Mr Friedman, could I ask you a favor? - Sure, asking's cheap. - I'd like to exchange my guitar for Andy. - Your guitar but how would you work? - I don't expect we'll be doin' much of that anymore. - No more music. - No, I guess not. - You mean you're gonna give it up just like that? - Mr Friedman, could I ask ya a favor? Could I exchange my guitar for Andy? - Okay, okay, I'll get ya Andy, I'll get him. Here's your Andy. - Here's the guitar. - Leave me alone with your guitars. I have enough guitars. - No that's. - No buts, go, here. - Thank you, Mr Friedman. (soft music) - Good luck. (soft music) - He's right, JD, we're going back to be an armature cowboy for the rest of your life. Just go on back, lead your two man band. That's what you know best. Just go on back and stay in your rut. Back and let some other foreman kick ya around. - [Man] Get out of the street! - Can't trust anything, no way! I've had it! I'm tired of bein' a loser, I'm tired of quitting! I don't want anymore, kid, it makes me sick! You listen to me, you listen good. I'm gonna try it, you hear me, I'm gonna try it and aint nobody gonna stop me, not even you! (soft music) (thunder cracking) Marcy, show me the entrance. - Here's the artist's entrance. - No, inside. - How about the basement here. - How do I get in there? - Here. - Make note of this, kid. Have you ever been there? - Sure. I picked up my junk there. - Is there ever a guard? - Sometimes yes, sometimes no. - Make a note of that, kid. You think you can get us in there? - Sure. - Give me those wiring plans, I wanna see 'em again. - Okay. - I hope you know what you're doing. - I know what I'm doin', just relax, look here. When we get up here, you're gonna have to cross over into here, you got it? - Yeah. - Once we get up in here, there may be a guard and if there is, you're gonna have to take him out. You understand? - Right. (rustling) - We can do it. Kid, get the coveralls, what time is is, Marcy? - 6:45. - That means we got just about an hour to bring it all, let's go. (intense music) - Hello Marcy, how you doing? - Just fine, Clarence, I come over to pick up a few things from the basement. - Okay ma'am, you can go in. - Thank you, Clarence. (intense music) (twangy music with lyrics) (applause) (chatter) (applause) - Ladies and gentlemen, the lights will be back on in a few minutes, right now we're gonna entertain ya, I'm JD Todd and this is the Salt Flat Kid but just sit back and relax, hit it, kid.
