Told you to be unheard and unseen. Invisible. Noise you're making, I'm damn sure the animal's in Mississippi by now. Yes, sir. Now we in the water so he don't hear us coming. That's a smart animal. He see, he smell, hear you coming. So you got to be smarter. Yes, Daddy. You understand me? Yes, Daddy. You got to be smarter. Yes, sir. There he is. There he is. Damn. Come on, boy! Stay with me. Come on! Come on, come on, boy. I'm with you! Come on! Darn! He got away. [ chuckles ] What you laughing at? You think this is fooling around? You got to respect this. Some nights your brain and gun is what put dinner on the table. It's about survival. It's all right. We almost got him. [ gunshot ] Quiet. What's wrong, Dad? Quiet, Marcus! Don't make a sound. [ chattering, hooting ] Come on, boy. Dollar waiting on a dime. Keep your nose clean. Catch up now, don't be laggin behnid. I'll see you in church on Sunday. Stay out here. Don't move. Don't move. [ creaking rope ] I hoped you'd live and never see that. It's done now. Don't ever forget it, Marcus. Don't ever forget it. [ panting ] Get your elbow off the table. Come on now. Finish up. You gotta do better than that, Daddy. More bite, come on. Nobody know I'm here. [ sigh ] Come on now, Daddy. I'm doing it right now. Marcus, I can do it myself. Be still. One bite. Brooks, quit fooling around with your food. Go on and get your books and get the hell on outta here. You gonna try to work tonight? No. Come on, give me a kiss. See you when I get home, Papa. You think you'd know I was here. Lucille? What's that on your blouse? It's from the Civil Rights League office. I thought the sheriff closed that office down. Kids at school say they're gonna open it up again. I don't give a damn. Take it off. But, Daddy, it's just a... Take it off before I rip it off! Now go. Go on. Gonna be late again. [ whistle blowing ] Hey, Mr. Weber? How you feeling? Feeling good since I passed that stone. Oh, that's pain. Oh, boy, that is pain. You never knew that kind of hurt. No, sir, Mr. Conley, I've never known that kind of hurt. Five orders are on the board. I want 'em packed and on the road before lunch. Yes, sir. Forklift knocked a stack of bales off their pallets. Clean it up. Yes, sir. Y'all have a good day. I'm sure glad you're here, man. This place been running like a crapper all morning. We need to get rolling. All right. Let's start this up. 52 bales, bay 2. Help me bring this back on. Come on. Morning, Marcus. How you doing, man? Feeling pretty good. How's your daddy? I'm feeding him, so he's eating more. That's good. Hey, hey, hey, T. J., man. My sister-in-law's coming up from New Orleans again Why don't you come over for dinner? No. Hey, what? You afraid of marriage, huh? Just sitting around the house getting fat? Oh, why not? 'Cause I done seen your in-laws. Hey, hey, hey! Try to do something good for you, look what you do, man. Pull this back on. Our shift don't start for two minutes. Pull it back. Come on. Man ain't gonna pay us more, for working two minutes, you know. [ chuckles ] All right. Put a bee in your bonnet. [ laughter ] Come on, man. We've got five orders to do. Here we are. So this is it, huh? This is it. Very nice. Is that a bullet hole? Shot gun. Okay. Where do we start? Well, tomorrow we get Louisiana driver's licenses. That way if we get stopped, we don't get hassled none. We are definitely gonna have to move these beds away from the windows. You know why? Less chance of getting shot at. Here, we'll tack these up against the windows so we can actually turn the lights on at night. Then all we gotta do is find a safe exit outta here in case the place gets bombed or catches fire somehow. You okay? [ thunder ] I like the white one best. We don't have it in a five and three-quarters, but we can order it. Excuse me. Can I help you? I'm just looking, thank you, ma'am. You put that hat on your head, you buy it. Thank you, ma'am. [ chattering ] Hey, how you doing? We're here to end segregation. Hi, how you doing? My name's Charlie from the civil rights office. I'm trying to end segregation in public places. We're with the National Civil Rights League. We're gonna be at the church on Sunday. We'd love to have the opportunity to talk to you. I think you may be interested in what we have to say. [ overlapping dialogue ] Hold on! You may be interested in what I have to say. This plant does not give you the opportunity to advance past the low menial jobs. We're planning on protesting and setting up... Morning, Mr. Conley. Some boycotts for the white businesses that do not hire black workers. Hi. Please come to the church on Sunday where we can have the opportunity to talk to you. We're gonna set up boycotts... [ singing hymn ] ♪ Do not pass me by ♪ Do not pass me by ♪ Do not pass me by ♪ Do not pass me by ♪ Oh no ♪ Do not pass me by ♪ Do not ♪ Pass me by [ applause ] Hallelujah! Hallelujah! You made us so happy with that beautiful music. Let the church say amen! Amen. Now this morning, we have two young men from up north and they're going to reopen the National Civil Rights League office and they asked for a minute of our time. Mr. Deane, please come forward. [ applause ] Ladies and gentlemen of the church, Reverend Gregory, deacons, elders, trustees, thank you for granting us this opportunity to speak to you today. My name is Michael Deane and this is my colleague, Charles Hillibrand. I've been an attorney for eight years. I teach at Columbia University in New York. I've spent a great deal of time working in the south fighting for a cause that I believe in from the bottom of my heart. I'm gonna go have a smoke. And that's for a moment of nonviolent integration, integration into the public schools, integration into the workplace. Now I have seen change occur all over the south and I know, if we work hard together, we can make those changes happen right here in Bogalusa, Louisiana. I'm here to help you. Excuse me? With your permission, Reverend Gregory? You have my permission. Mr. Deane, are you aware that the last man that the National Civil Rights League sent down here, Brother Moon, left town in the middle of the night? They firebombed his house. He didn't really understand what was goin' on down here. I'm aware that Brother Moon was disrespectfully removed from this community. But, sir, I do understand what is going on. I went to Mississippi when Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were missing and I was there when their bodies were dragged out of the water. The Klan in this part of the country is extremely violent. We protest, they bust our heads open! And the newspapers don't even take pictures of it, so how you gonna get us national exposure? Well, we do what Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Does. We get our younger people involved in the marches. We get our younger people involved in the protests. What? Now believe me, if anyone should try and attack them, the press will be here! Permission to speak, Reverend Gregory? Speak, son. Now no disrespect to the elders, but as a young person of the church, I have been following the changes these men been talkin' about. Now I think, if we want Bogalusa to change, now's the time! And why not here? You know, Reverend King was only 26 years old during the Montgomery bus boycotts. And people our age been changing things all over the south. There will be violence. Now can I guarantee that no one is going to get hurt? No, I can't. But I can guarantee that, if there are blows to be taken, I will take the first blows. Thank you. [ applause ] All right, all right, settle down. This man is talking about our children, our children. And that not only gives us something to think about, but something also to pray about! Marcus, you didn't even hear what the man had to say. That boy's got some pretty good ideas. He gonna bring some folks in from up north. And they could make a change 'cause I'm getting damn tired of the way it is. I'm telling you, Marcus, God's with us. How much did God help those little girls in Birmingham? Hi. I'm Michael Deane. Timothy McDaniels. Call me T. J. Archie, Archie Scott. Hi. What can we do? I wanna talk to you about setting up some boycotts. You're on your own with this one, T. J. And together we could change the conditions of that plant. What you have in mind? Lucille? Let's go. I'm gone. Oh, come on, Marcus. You ready? Come on. I wanna drive a truck at the plant. I worked in transport in Korea. Or be a loading supervisor. What do I have to do to get it? Tell me how it works down there. Well, right now, all the supervisors are white. No black can apply for it. Most the blacks have menial jobs, low pay. It's real bad. What's that, Mr. Weber? Sign-up sheet for loading supervisor, extra 50 cents an hour. I'm in. Come on, Kenny. Extra 50 cents an hour should keep you on your butt. 50 cents an hour? Hell, I can live with that. It's not for you boys. Come on, T. J., let's go home. Come on, T. J. Yeah, you right. I ain't gonna take no more of this. Where you going? T. J.? What you doing, T. J.? Signing my name. T. J., you need to come down here. Come on down. Mr. Weber? T. J., you can't put your name up there. Now you know that. Why not? Coloreds don't do the supervisor positions. You understand that? There's a first time for everything, Mr. Weber. Better have a talk with your boy, Marcus. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Weber. I'm gonna talk to him. I'll talk to him. T. J., what in the name of holy God got into you? You gone crazy? You can get us all killed. I'm tired, Marcus. Fear the night, niggers. Fear the night. Hey, Dad. How you feel? I'm okay for a man with a stroke. Where is everybody? Well, hey to you too. Sorry. I'm just hungry or something. Lucille! Brooks! Supper's on, let's go! She not home. Where is she? Where is she, Rose? She's at the Civil Rights League office with the two white boys. Lookie here, you're gonna have to give her a little room on this! Oh, no, I don't. Now Reverend King has used people our age in the past. We can march and we can protest, but nobody's gonna change our city except ourselves. Now we need to get every Negro person voting in Bogalusa. But with all due respect, the Negro Voters League run by Reverend Gregory is completely ineffective. [ overlapping dialogue ] Now keep in mind what we're talking about. Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were just murdered for doing exactly what we are discussing. So I want everyone to talk to their parents. I want everyone to think about the potential dangers involved. Don't go into this lightly, okay? Lucille! Come on. Excuse me. I gotta go. Daddy? Shut up. We're gonna deal with this when we get home. If you find you near her, talking to her, getting her involved in any way, I'm gonna slap the taste out your mouth. Let's go. [ banging ] Well, well, what do we have here? Y'all gonna have to cease and desist. We're closing this office down once again. You are not permitted to practice law in the state of Louisiana. Am I correct? Yes, you are correct. Yeah, well, do you wanna close the doors or you wanna go to jail? Sir, while we are not members of the Louisiana Bar, state law does allow us to disseminate our legal opinions so long as we don't attempt to actually practice law or have ourselves passed off as state-sanctioned attorneys. All right. We'll let the court decide. Cuff 'em. This building is the private property of a nonprofit organization! By interfering with our organization, you're in direct violation of several city and state codes! All right! I want this place cleared out or else you'll follow 'em to jail! Where y'all going? Don't wanna see you here anymore, all right? Marcus, what the hell are you doing here? I'm just getting my daughter. I want you to talk to these people. I don't wanna see 'em here again. I don't wanna have to arrest 'em. Yes, sir. Reverend Gregory know what you're doing? [ police siren ] You be careful. You be real careful. [ thunder ] Time to go home, cat. [ meows ] Go on, go on. Hey, T. J.! [ laughs ] You ain't goin' nowhere! You're gonna take your name off that list tomorrow. You hear me, boy? I got a right to have my name on that list! Oh, no, you don't. Marcus! You're gonna take your name off that list tomorrow. I got a right to have my name on that list! No, you don't. Marcus! Are you gonna take it off? I got a right to put my name on that list! You're taking your name off that list tomorrow, hear me? Marcus! [ grunting ] Praise the Lord. The only reason you boys ain't hurting is 'cause you got the same skin color as God. But this is a one-time pass. Remember what happened to those northern boys in Mississippi. Y'all know which way to go. Let's go. You've gotta be kidding me! No. I'm not kidding. They're not fooling around, Michael! They will kill us! Yeah, I know. Why are you willing to die for this? Do you hear me? Why, Charlie? Because our skin is not the same color as God's. It's okay. I respect you. You take care of yourself. Michael? I'm not like you! I wanna get married and live to see my children, Goddamn it! Goddamn it! [ whistle blows ] [ phone rings ] You okay? It was a damn fool thing to do, Marcus. I should have listened to you. I'm sorry. Nothing to be sorry about. I heard it. I should have helped. I know your heart, Marcus. Besides, you got a family. I should have known better. Marcus! Marcus! It's your daddy! Is he all right? I don't know, there's something wrong. What's goin' on? Hey, Daddy? Daddy? I'm gonna get you to the hospital. You all right? Scared. Don't be scared, Daddy. God's with you. You don't... be scared. Daddy? Daddy? All right, Daddy. Treat us fair, treat us right! Negroes' money accounts for 37% of Bogalusa's downtown business. But none of those businesses will hire Negro workers! Now there are gonna be people who will try and provoke us, people who will try and intimidate us, make us give in, make us go home! We not goin' home! Get the hell off this street! This is a decent town! Treat us right! Treat us fair. Treat us right! Treat us fair! Treat us right! Treat us fair! Look out the window, Mr. Mayor. People coming in to do their shopping, do their banking. They see what's goin' on down there. They're not even parking! Now I'm not fooling around with this. We are losing a lot of business, Sam! We need you to end it now! Clarence, it's not that simple. Just arrest 'em. It's not gonna work. They're minors. These charges aren't gonna mean a damn thing to them. Well, just say the word. We got clubs, we got tear gas. They won't come back. Find me a legal reason I can do it. Throw a dart. They're threatening city property. Good enough. Do it the old-fashioned way. Walter, I don't want this in Bogalusa. [ police sirens ] You all are in violation of several city ordinances and are ordered to disperse immediately! We are within our rights to protest peacefully! Don't move! Legally, they cannot do anything to us. Move out! Are you hearing what I'm saying? I am telling you for the last time! Form your lines! Move or we will move you forcibly and arrest you! If you do, you will be violating our constitutional rights to assemble and protest! This is your last warning! Gas 'em! Hold steady. Marcus, Marcus, ain't that Lucille? Where you goin', Marcus? [ all shouting at once ] Lucille! [ shrieking, coughing ] [ cries ] I'll kill you, you hit my daughter! [ shouting ] [ shouting, chattering ] Marcus, come on! Get Lucille. Get Lucille, Marcus! Come on! [ choking ] Let's go! Come on, Marcus. Come on, baby. You're gonna pay, nigger. Go, let's go! [ screaming ] Ah! God damn commie traitor. Traitor! Let's go! Charlie, get 'em outta here! [ screaming ] [ choking, gasping ] Get in the car! Start! Let's go, let's go, let's go! [ groans ] Don't want to hear nothing else about this! Nothing! When they said no colored, they don't mean no grown folks! They mean me, Daddy! I done told you no! You know what no means! No! Lucille, you were nearly killed today! It's over with! It's over! Black folks have been killed by the Klan since ever and you won't do nothing! Lucille, you don't shut your mouth, I swear to God I'm gonna knock some sense into your head. No! Then hit me, Daddy, your daughter! Get mad at the white man, not me! Lucille! No! No! There is a lot you don't understand! [ crying ] He won't listen! [ crying ] No. You're right, baby. They went to hit you. I didn't think twice about stopping 'em. You're right, baby. What's that make me? Nobody move! Get back! Get your hands where... [ screaming, shouting ] Just don't hurt my family! Jimmy, is that him? Yes, sir. Take him away! Where you taking my husband? He assaulted a police officer. Now we're just gonna question him. Daddy! Brooks, you stay there! Really disappointed me, Marcus. I was just protecting my daughter. Nigger, that's a privilege you don't have. Take him away. No! Stay back outta the way! Come on, boy. What's the name of the white boy lawyer you been working with? Michael Deane. All right. You go pack your bag and you and Brooks go down to Auntie Bella's house now! Go! I'll call you later! Brooks, let's go! Rose Clay and my partner, Charlie, just got back from the jail. When they got there, they found out that Marcus had not been charged with any crime and he had been released just minutes earlier. So that's another Negro on your head! My son can't stand because of the pain in his back from where he was clubbed. How dare you bring children out there! [ crowd shouting ] Leave is be! I'm sorry. Believe me, that was the last thing that we wanted to happen, but we are not going to stop now. Enough! Stop! As head of the Voters League, I'm gonna meet with the mayor and I'm gonna ask him to guarantee the safety of the Negro people. And in exchange for that, the Voters League will make every effort to stop these protests at City Hall. Marcus? Marcus? Marcus? Oh, Marcus, my God. Look what they did to you. We gotta take you to the hospital, baby. Everybody's at the church worrying about you. Look at me, Rose. You see what they did to me? See what I look like? I've spent all my life, all my life, yes, sir, no, sir. I never looked 'em in the eye and I been always smiling at 'em. You see what they did? They beat me like a dog, Rose. They don't want me to even have the thought, the thought that I'm a man. They said they gonna do the same. They gonna do the same thing to Brooks and they gonna do the same thing to Brooks' kids and they gonna do the same thing to they kids. And this has gotta stop. This has gotta stop, Rose. I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. That's gonna change. Marcus, please. Take me to church, okay? Let's go to church. I would like the Voters League to call a vote on whether to endorse these protests and that'll be the first vote. And then I want to put on the table the issue of asking Mr. Deane and his partner to leave town, bring peace to our community! Over my dead body! Marcus? Marcus? Hey, let me take you to the hospital. I'm okay. Matter of fact, I'm doing pretty good. Just let me be. Go on with your meeting, Rev. I'm so sorry, Marcus. It's okay. It's the last time. Let's just go on with the meeting. Well, I was gonna call for a vote on asking Mr. Deane... No! Never again! Marcus, we're going to have a vote! And if they want to, Reverend, these young people gonna march tomorrow and the day after and the day after! I understand your pain, but that is not for you to decide! And that includes my daughter! And not Neely or the Klan or any of these white sons of bitches are ever gonna hurt them again! I understand you're hurt, but this is God's house! Do not use that language in here! Now we're gonna have a vote. I call a vote for a new leader of the Voters League! Pastor Gregory, we know each other for a lot of years now and I love you like a brother, but it's a new time. In the rest of the south, you know what they calling this? "Freedom Summer". Why shouldn't it be "Freedom Summer" in Bogalusa, Louisiana? I nominate Marcus Clay! Marcus has always dealt with the white management of the plant for us. He'd be good. I second that nomination! All those in favor of Marcus Clay becoming the new leader of the Voters League, raise your hands. Raise your hands! All those opposed? I can't go along with that. Well, then it's done. Marcus? Right. Come on, Marcus. Say somethin', Marcus. Come on, Marcus. Reverend Gregory, you served this church for many years. I have great respect for Reverend Gregory. He has always been there for me. I don't know what to tell y'all. I'm gonna talk to these white boys here. They must have some idea. Truth is, I only know one thing for sure. What happened to our children today will never ever happen again or they will have to come through me. Reverend? [ gunshot ] Don't ever forget it. So what's on your mind, Marcus? You killed white men, didn't you, T. J.? Yeah. How many? You told me. Two, three you know of in a war in Germany? Yeah. Why are we afraid now? You're all crazy. I was in the war. I fought hard for my country. I was a tanker man. Archie? You and T. J. Served together in Korea. I have fought in the First War. You killed white men? I did. You remember Double V? What it meant to Negro soldiers? Victory abroad, victory at home, victory against oppression, racism. We with you, Marcus. What happened to that victory? What you suggesting, sir? I'm suggesting we defend ourselves. Most of the Negroes live in Mapleton, so we secure it. Archie? T. J.? You wanna secure... Yes, sir. First, we arm ourselves. Lock the Klan outta of our neighborhood. Second, we take night shifts at the plant so we can watch over our children when they march in the protest. Well, when do we sleep? You sleep when you dead. Third, we give armed escorts to these white boys so they can stay and organize so we can get that godforsaken paper plant desegregated and get the jobs we have coming to us! There was a group that he was talking about in Alabama and, I think, in Mississippi. They made like little armies protecting folks from the Night Riders. They did it. So can we. Marcus, ain't this taking things a little too far? It's called for and you know it, Archie! This is an army of one, then it's an army of one. I gave my word. Gentlemen, I've been waiting for this day my whole life. All right. Archie? All right, then. Let's get started. Hey, what you doin' up? You know how late it is? You know somethin', Daddy? What, Brooks? I'm scared. Well, I could think of two reasons why you should be scared. Only two? Only two. That's all I got, but they're some good ones. Your grandma, she always used to tell me, God is on your shoulder, God is on your shoulder. Right now, I can feel Him here and here. What's the other? I'm a big strong man, right? And I would never let anybody hurt you, hear? Get back in bed. Go, go. Love you, boy. Love you too, Daddy. To help protect both the black and the white popu... oh, no, no, no. I don't want any guns, any baseball bats. You want us to go? That's not what he's saying. That is exactly what I'm saying. Mr. Clay, this movement is nonviolent and we will not resort to this! You ain't resortin' to a damn thing! We are! As long as you stand down here and run these protests and my daughter's marching in 'em, we gonna keep you alive. Well, then we won't march. We'll call it off. I'll pack up. No, you won't. Maybe we should compromise, Michael, need some kind of protection... Walt, Billy, John, you keep 'em company. In four hours, you get relieved. You know what, Marcus? You can go to hell! Nonviolence is the essence of everything this movement stands for. It is the essence of everything I stand for! We are supposed to be better than them. If we stay alive, we will be better than them. That's how I measure it. Alive is better than dead! And, by the way, I'm already in hell. So don't you tell me about the essence of your summer vacation. The colored man been wading in this shit for 400 years. You come down here to my town, try to tell me how to fight my fight? My fight? We'll be around every 10 minutes. You got your whistle? What's that under your leg? Good for you. So this how we gonna live? For now, unless you know something else. You're telling me I got to choose between my children growing up with dignity or a life of my husband? I don't know an answer for that. Rose, I gotta go. Go on then. Go! Go! Go! Go on now. Here we go! Get back in the damn car! Don't even turn around. You're outta your mind, Marcus. Shut your mouth! That sheet ain't gonna hide what a fat piece of shit you are, Kenner. Give it here! You tell your Grand Wizard, Poobah Dragon, whatever the fuck he calls hisself, come down this area again, he gonna get a whuppin'. Now you boys should get the hell outta here. Shut up or I'll beat your ass right now! We ain't like y'all. Get the hell on outta here. Just drive yourself on outta here! [ chuckles ] Boy, do you know what we just done? And I lived to see that day. Phew, thank you, Lord. Like deacons defending they church. That was righteous. What y'all think about the name the Deacons for Defense and Justice? Deacons for Defense. Makes sense to me. It's a righteous name for a righteous cause. I like it. The Deacons for Defense. Now why won't you let Chief Neely arrest 'em? We know the names of most of them. Not only did they assault white men, but those Negroes have guns. William, you're a teacher, an intelligent man. You know what was going on out there tonight. Now do we have to say it out loud? We need to control them. Now if you can't do it with the hand of government, it is our obligation, our divine right, to lord it over the beasts. Let's get those white boys, Deane and Hillibrand, out at least. Those boys are communists. Just say the word and we'll bring 'em in. They have cars down there from Baton Rouge in New Orleans. There are white reporters, Negro reporters. There's Life magazine. If we arrest Deane or Hillibrand, those reporters will be all over it and we don't even have anything to charge 'em with. So what if they're just missing? Well, after what happened in Mississippi, you want the FBI down here? Sam, I'm just about 13 days away from bankruptcy. Why can't we just fire 'em, take away their income? Who? All the Negroes at the plant? You mean shut down the cornerstone of the economy of this town? So not the plant. There are other jobs. Every person who cleans a toilet or takes care of your children or cooks your food or fixes the brakes on your car, one-third of this town is Negroes. They're everywhere. So you tell me who to fire first. You make it sound like we should be scared. You know who made that sandwich? Poured that water? The Klan can deliver a lot of votes and we can take a lot of votes away. Well, then don't vote for me, William, all right? Now, look, give a list of names to Neely. He'll go out and check that they have permits for their weapons. He'll check their cars for violations. But other than that, I can't help you. Well, gentlemen, I will weed this field myself. I'm bringing in Klansmen from all over the state. Now this is a crisis. Those Negroes have formed an army. If they succeed here, think they won't do this in Alabama? Seems like it's growing. Best guess, there's more than 30 of 'em now. Their leader's definitely Marcus Clay. He's like a rabid animal that's completely uncontrollable and needs to be put down. Now who would like that privilege? [ chants ] We started with five men. Now look at us. Larger, stronger! Let me hear it! Yes, sir! Each squad stays within 100-yards of the other squad. Use your whistles. Don't start talking or bunching up with other squads. Use your eyes. See them before they see you. All right, let's go. Never again! Never again! 'Til peace comes at last! 'Til peace comes at last! Deacons for Defense! Deacons for Defense! Deacons for Defense! [ chanting continues ] Go to! [ cheering ] When we met, we was always laughing and joking. We was closer. What happened? Our kids got big. I look at 'em and I get scared. I don't think I could live if they got hurt. I'd rather die than let anything happen to them. Let the white man do whatever he wants, just don't hurt my babies. Walk all over me. Just don't hurt them. I been telling myself that for years, but it's over. You gotta keep yourself safe, Marcus Clay, 'cause I need you. They might kill me, Rose. Until that happens, I'm gonna love you. I love our kids. I'm gonna love God and I'm gonna live like a man, like a man does. For all that time I didn't, I'm so sorry. I've missed you so much. You are something else. You know that? I love you. I'm back. [ whistle blows ] Patterson Paper employs 40% of the people of Bogalusa. The way Patterson Paper goes, so goes this city. We do not control this city. Yes, you do. Two of the five members of City Council are Patterson Paper employees. 70% of the income of Bogalusa comes from Patterson Paper. What's your point? One, you've never hired any female Negroes to work in this factory. Two, all the work spaces are segregated. Three, Negro workers have passed aptitude and skill tests and still can't progress past the lowest paying jobs. Marcus, let me stop you for one second here. I've known you for a long time and I respect your position as head of the Voters League. But it's gonna take some time. We're just one little factory here. Don't fool with us, Mr. Gower. You are part of the 88th largest corporation in the United States. You have net sales of $616 million with assets of over $645 million. Really? I didn't even know that. Shall we bring the unfair promotional practices and the illegal segregated workplaces to the attention of the national media? Is that what it's gonna take? No Negro workers have ever moved up to the position of truck driver or supervisor. T. J. McDaniels was beaten simply for putting his name on the list. We don't know anything about that! What? Look, it's a very nice idea to have a colored man as a supervisor. But it would mean at some point that he would have to supervise white men. You see, Patterson Paper corporate headquarters... Is in Seattle. I've already written to two vice presidents in charge of hiring there. Well, then you know that company policy dictates that Patterson will not go against any local customs, no matter how offensive or repugnant we personally may feel them to be. I see. You're right. Because where I come from up north in Philadelphia, we like to drown redneck racists like cats. So that would be okay, right? No matter how offensive or repugnant it happens to be? Because that's just the way it is around here! You can leave. Yes, sir. I promise you, Mr. Gower, we will shut this place down! You better talk to him, Marcus. This is out of hand. I think you better... I think you better listen to him. I seen him drown three rednecks already. Bubbles coming up out the water and whatnot. It was awful. It was downright ugly. Jim, I'm standing here at the north entrance to the Patterson Paper Company. Now, as you can see, we have a large group massing right here in front of the main gate. As I understand it, there's already been... Just blocks from where I'm standing, a large protest has completely shut down Patterson Paper. This is a massive factory and there are trucks backed up for several blocks that the protestors aren't allowing into the factory. [ intercom buzzes ] Yeah? Sir, the national press is here and we've got pickets in front of our building. Pickets? And we're on goddamned national television. Get me the plant at Bogalusa. The order's come down from national headquarters in Seattle. We are going to be making some changes around the plant. From now on, all segregation in the plant is to be discontinued. We're gonna share the bathrooms with the coloreds? Yes. The bathrooms will be desegregated. This is the letter from Seattle. "Effective immediately, all areas will be permanently desegregated, not limited to, but including the cafeteria, workplaces, water fountains, locker rooms and restrooms." [ complaining ] This is by order of the company president and approved by the Board of Directors. [ cheering, shouting ] I'm sending you this letter with the greatest urgency... Luke, you're replaced. Frankie, take his place. Listen, I really appreciate everything you've done for us, but... Just watching out for my daughter. Well, with all due respect, Mr. Clay, you might wanna try talking to her. She'd like it if you communicated with her a little bit. She would? Very much so. She understands a lot more about you than you think she does. If I were you, I wouldn't get involved in my family business. Dangerous and violent situations brewing. Armed factions, we request that federal troops be brought to Bogalusa to help both the black and white population. You scared? As scared as I've ever been. The letter's right. Somebody gonna need protectin'. Let's go. Tremendous urgency. This is not simply a request. It is a plea. [ phone rings ] [ knocking on door ] You got a minute? Yeah. Did you get my memo on Bogalusa? Yes, I did. You have confirmation? We sent in some state police undercover and they confirmed it for us. There is a war heating up down there. There are Negroes taking up arms. Now the KKK is already well-armed and well-financed by the White Citizens Council and they're organizing. We believe there are hundreds of KKK members coming into the area. You know where Bogalusa is? No. I had to look it up on a map. You heard national press about this before you started your investigation? No, I didn't. But, listen now, this is different. There is a militant Negro group that is armed and ready to fight. That's only happened a few times before. There are two armies gathering down there. Johnson just got the National Civil Rights Bill through Congress. He's done enough damage to the south. He's a southerner, for God's sake. He needs those states. He's not gonna let us send troops down there unless it's called for. Well, what about the people of the city? The white people and the colored people? When that war breaks out, what happens then? God help 'em. [ shouting, hooting ] Brothers, please. Please! Now we have a white company like Patterson Paper telling us how to run our lives! Taking our jobs. Spreading communism and niggerism to our community. They're taking our way of life! Klan, I ask you to stand tall, stand proud, exalt in your whiteness, in your intelligence, in your superiority. It's our turn now. White power reign down on this great country of ours. White power! White power! White power! White power! [ chanting continues ] [ screams ] [ shouting ] Three homes burned, Marcus. 45 wounded, 35 hospitalized, six of them children. One woman was stripped down in front of her daughter. She didn't say what all they did to her. By the grace of God, nobody died. This only works, Marcus, if we carrying a bigger stick as they do. We lost tonight, but I know we... We reassign the men, fill up for the wounded, even up the scores. That's what we do. We can't fight the Klan. Two of my guys were throwing rocks at 'em. Rocks, Marcus, against guns! We put more men on the perimeter. Put more men on patrol at the same time. Marcus, we can't do this! Not like this! You got a better idea? Three of our neighbors lost their homes, man. This is one night. This is what it's about! There's gonna be losses! Gentlemen, gentlemen, please! We can't go back, so let's all take a deep breath. I have us a plan. There's a gentleman I can speak to, an old Army buddy in New Orleans. Who is he? He runs the Negro Longshoremen's Union. What we talking about, Otis? I'm talking about building up. I'm talking about real weapons. I'm talking about arming every one of us. Who gonna give guns to a mob of angry niggers? The white man put us to work out in the fields, in the factories and down on the docks. Everything for a 1,000 miles moves in and out of the docks in New Orleans and colored men lift half of it. Bananas, cars, guns. My boy! Oh, how you been? Good, good, yeah. Let's get these cars loaded and get the hell on outta here, huh? I can't take this. You give it to the church. You sure? Give it to the church. We thank you. Come on, let's go. Marcus, you better get over here. That's an M-60. Shoots 600 rounds per minute. Look at these. Otis, what is this? A weapon. What's wrong? I been to war already. I didn't like it then. Marcus, this ain't war. We can't use this. Comes to it, I'll use it. If it comes to it, it'll be the end of the world. End of our world, at least. No, man. You hand those out, I'm walking away from here. I'm not handing them out. Not yet. Otis, put 'em back. Put 'em down, Otis. You come with me. Gentlemen, we are not playing games, hmm? I'm with you on this, Otis. Have a seat, Marcus. You want something? You been missing days. There's talk about letting you go. I covered all my shifts. I'm not supposed to say this. I'm just telling you what's being discussed. You're gonna have real trouble. All right then. I'm just trying to help you. Yeah, yeah. This letter says they sent down two busloads of clergy from New York and Detroit. I don't see any buses. We are here on our own. Hold on a second. Hold on! There's supposed to be a deacon posted here. Yeah. Where is he? Make me smile. Give me a reason to pull this trigger. Now drop the gun, boy. [ groans ] Run, you nigger lovers! Run! Go! Oh, my God, Michael! It's gonna be all right! It's gonna be all right. Now you boys were given a good Christian warning and you just didn't listen. Gentlemen, beat 'em with the strength of the Lord and the rage of the devil. [ grunting ] Where's Marcus? Inside. Marcus! Marcus! They got Carl! They got John and the white boys! [ cocks rifle ] They look real bad. I'll take 'em to the hospital in New Orleans. Marcus? Two things. No more violence, I'm begging you! And the other? I'm coming back. Move, Archie! Take 'em to the hospital. Go on. Go ahead! Mr. Governor, these northern groups, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Congress on Racial Equality, they're bussing people in from all over the country, New York, Washington, Detroit. On the other hand, I got the Klan readying for war. They're bringing people in from all over the state. Judge Christenberry has ordered you and the Bogalusa police to protect the protestors. You're goin' against a federal decree, Mr. Mayor! I understand that, sir. I've got coloreds here with automatic rifles, pistols. We even have some reports they have hand grenades. [ shouting ] [ dogs barking ] Riots broke out in downtown Bogalusa in reactions to the shooting of two Negro law enforcement officers. One officer was killed and the other was critically injured. Negro protestors were repelled by... President Johnson's pissed off. He wants this to end. Didn't you tell me that God is gonna help the people of Bogalusa? Just get your ass down there and end it now. Who are you? I'm Alan Garrison. I'm a lawyer for the Department of Justice. Come on. Our position is we need to end the violence now before somebody's killed. That ain't gonna happen. We got children marching. You want me to just leave 'em to be shot or clubbed? No. I've already put together a case against the police, Chief Neely and his deputies, that I'm bringing to the Federal Court. Thank you. I'm gonna force them to protect the protestors so you and your men don't have to. [ laughs ] Marcus, please. Listen. I know Mayor Martinson has already set up a meeting for you and him to sit down with the governor. Are you gonna go to that? Start working this out? I'm thinking about it. You want me to stop the protest? I wouldn't, if I were you. The name of the game is to make as much noise as you can for as long as you can. Eventually, the cavalry will come in. Oh, so you're the cavalry now? I thought the cavalry was supposed to show up before they lynched the people. We got cemeteries filled with people waiting for y'all! Marcus... I ain't waiting for the cavalry. [ sighs ] Set up the meeting, Mr. Garrison. You don't want no pie? Yeah. All right, boys. Y'all made your point. So let me tell you what we're proposing. You tell me, Mr. Governor, if I'm misspeaking. The prudent cause would be to hear your demands, talk about them if there was a truce. Let everybody cool down, stop protesting, stop boycotting white businesses and then we start to talk. Excuse me. You brought us down here to say stop and we can have a talk? We're already talking right now! Let's discuss it right now. Thank you. I brought you down here, you and the mayor, so we could end the violence. Let's get down to brass tacks. What do you boys personally want? And how can we help you? How can you help us? Okay, Mr. Governor, let me make this real simple for you. Desegregate the public spaces. Desegregate the city jobs. That's our starting point. Anything less is unacceptable, period. And as head of the Voters League, I can guarantee you that the boycotts and the protests will continue if our demands are not met. We will listen to your demands. Now I can't promise anything. Those are sweeping changes. That happen to be federal law. Our city is coming into line with federal civil rights laws, but right now, I'm asking you to take the first step. Stop protesting, stop boycotting. When I urinate, it comes out bloody 'cause of the damage done to my kidneys from a beating I took from your police department. So don't you dare ask me to take the first step! Well, I am sorry about that, Marcus. But I am demanding you end protests, end boycotts. You can't demand a damn thing. All you guarantee me is more talking. That's what I'm asking you to take back to your people 'cause I hear you may not even be the president of the Voters League by Saturday. Go to hell. Let's go. What is most important is we need the so-called Deacons for Defense to disarm and no longer maintain patrols! Excuse me? What are you talking about? Deacons for Defense? What is that? A church group? You heard of it, T. J.? Don't know nothing about it. You, Archie? Not me. We ain't heard of 'em. I'll tell you if I find 'em. You take care of yourself. Tea? Go on, do it! [ spits ] [ laughs ] Brooks, what you doin' in the dark? Come over here. Come on. How'd you get so beautiful? Aw, Daddy. No, I mean it. How did you get to be so beautiful? From you. You still scared? One day, I promise you, you're not gonna feel that way no more. It's gonna be all right. [ sighs ] It's gonna be all right. Y'all wanna see me? Yes. Come, Marcus. Come on in. Come sit with us. Now the congregation put together some boxes of food for you and your family and we also raised a collection here. No, I can't. You gotta provide for your family. Marcus, please? Thank you. You look tired, Marcus. I am tired. Maybe you should stay home tonight. Stay in tonight, Marcus. We got it covered. Marcus, maybe you should step down from the Voters League. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Nothing personal. We ain't even gonna discuss that. Nothin' was achieved with the governor. After the blood that has been spilled, after the tears from marching every day, we are no further along. Marcus has given his life to this! This can't go on forever! Of course, it can! What are you talking about? Please! Listen. I been in touch with Dr. King's folks. I asked them to send somebody down here to help us. What'd they say? Well, because of their stance on nonviolence, they said they cannot afford to be associated with us because of the Deacons. We're on our own down here. It's because of Marcus that we can't get whatever we need. You shut up! Please, please, please! I have been living in fear of the Klan all my life. It was bred in me as a child and it made me less than a man. But all of that has changed because of you. You freed me, son. You woke up something in me, so don't you stop. Don't you dare stop. And tomorrow, I'm gonna be marching with you and I'm gonna march every day to change what's happening down here. And there ain't gonna be no change in leadership. Ain't gonna be no stepping down. Marcus is still in charge. That's right. Amen. Now, you men, let's get these groceries over to Marcus's house. Be careful out there. Marcus, God bless you, my son. Keep the faith, Marcus, keep the faith. Never again. I hear you're winning everybody over. Where's your buddy? He's down at the office. We're both back. You gonna go back and join the protest? Well, how you doing, Michael? Oh, not too bad, Marcus. Thanks for asking. They knocked out five teeth in the back of my mouth, fractured a couple of bones. Good news is, the doctor says that the bleeding in my liver has stopped. Oh, that's real good, Michael. Glad to see you back up on your feet. You wanna be my friend now. Why don't you get on the floor? I'll go outside and see if I can find me some good old boys to kick you around a little bit. I'll tell 'em you don't like to defend yourself. They'll be lined up all around the corner. [ laughs ] You ready for a real good ass-whipping? [ laughs ] Yeah. I am ready for a real good ass-whipping. But, no, I do not wanna be your friend. I just thought maybe you might look at me differently once I had my face cracked open. But, fuck it, you wanna hate me 'cause I'm white? Or you wanna not trust me 'cause I'm... Whatever, Marcus? I don't care. But I'm gonna be here and I am gonna be here fighting. All right, then. You wanna come over to my house, get something to eat? No. I really don't. Okay. Just a little respect for my effort. That's all I really want. Federal officer. Go ahead. Just the two men I wanted to speak to. I didn't know you two were friends. [ chuckles ] What's going on? I brought a suit in Federal Court against the Bogalusa police and the Washington Parish police. We go Monday. I'd like you both to be there. Definitely. Good. Marcus? If my friend goes, I go. Okay. What are y'all fixing to eat? Lester? Yes, Mr. Mayor? Cease and desist. But... In reference to Marcus Clay, any orders you've been given, cease and desist. The governor does not want any more tension put here. You understand? I said do you understand me? Yes, sir. Good. [ siren blaring ] This is a list of Ku Klux Klan members? That's the list that I and other federal agents collected from our observations of the Ku Klux Klan activities. And this is a list of the local Bogalusa police. You'll see that several members of the police department are members of the Ku Klux Klan. Captain Joseph Lawson, one of the defendants, is among them. Let's look at this movie you took. Now I see photos and film in Bogalusa and all I see are Confederate flags. Is there not one American flag in the town of Bogalusa? I see the police doing nothing to protect those people. Turn it off! I gave the order once in July and now here I am again. I am making this court decree for the last time. You stop beating and harassing and arresting and clubbing these people! You protect them! And you ensure their constitutional right to protest. The instant you do not, you'll be in violation of my decree and you will be jailed. Is that clear? Also, these known Klan members, William Chase and Lester Conley, I'm issuing a declaration stating that these men cannot be within 100 yards of a demonstration. I will end this. We're adjourned. Marcus! Gentlemen, we won! At least acknowledge that. Victories are few and far between in this fight. He made the same ruling a couple of months ago. Didn't mean anything then. Do you think the police listen to the federal government, Mr. Garrison? You know who the police listen to in Louisiana? Who? The Klan. Do you know what the Klan is, Mr. Garrison? Because for me, coming from up north, this has been one eye-opening experience. I know what the Klan is. I don't think you do. The Klan is not beer-drinking rednecks with sheets on their heads. The Klan is an incredibly violent paramilitary fascist organization that dictates to the police, the local government, the school boards. It's more murderous, pervasive and influential than any criminal organization in the United States, including the mafia. And the only reason that Hoover and the rest of the world is not up in arms about it is because their victims are black. The only reason you're here is because somebody in the government didn't like seeing little black children being beat up on the news every night. You think I'm the enemy here? I risked my life coming down here. Mr. Garrison, I appreciate that. But the truth is, you're never gonna get hard white southern boys to protect Negroes. Don't underestimate me, Mr. Clay. See, if you're wrong, you're gonna go back to court and fight another day. Gonna get another decree. But for me, it means somebody I know or love gets a bullet in their head. This decree is right, Mr. Garrison, but we all know that that decree is gonna be tested. And when it is, the Deacons, the Deacons, will be there. Over the past months, riots have broken out in protest to Judge Herbert Christenberry's court ruling. School integration is being strongly challenged by the Klan and other local white-only groups. A Klan spokesman has stated that this is a crucial test of local and states rights. Parish and local police departments have been reluctant to enforce the court's decree. In Bogalusa, local Klan leaders have declared that they will make a final stand and test the Christenberry ruling by resisting the integration of Bogalusa High. The Deacons for Defense have vowed to defend the black students' right to integrate at all costs. All right, fellas, it's on. Lucille? Lucille, you remember what I told you? Yes. Go to it. Okay, everybody, let's go! All right, y'all. Get to your cars! Hurry! [ shouting, talking ] Get this bunch of animals! Everybody get outta here! Move, move! This bunch of niggers! Keep going, keep going. They shouldn't be around us, you understand? Ready for a test? Take them down the back. Get 'em outta here! Get on the bus! Daddy, I'm not gonna get on... Get on the bus. I'm not leaving. Go on inside! Go on inside! You stay there! Don't you come outta there! They shouldn't be here. They're a bunch of niggers! Don't fire unless you're fired upon. I don't like this. Are you ready? Yes, sir! [ police siren ] I'm ordering you to put your weapons down right now! We ain't putting down a damn thing unless you get them the hell outta here! Disarm your men right now or I will confiscate these guns! I'd rather die before somebody takes this gun outta my hands. You are under a federal order to protect these people. They hit us, they beat us, and all we do is lift up our guns and defend ourselves, and you go crazy. If you do not protect these people, you will be arrested, sir. You get the fuck outta my face, boy! All right. Charlie, I want you to go to the school. I want you to find a phone and call the Eastern District Federal Courthouse in Baton Rouge. All right. Wait, wait! Marcus, be reasonable. We know each other a long time. Order your men to put their guns down. Why don't you get their guns? It's time to take a stand! It's them or us! I'm talking to you. All right, then. I'll put my gun down. Christenberry said you were gonna defend my life. He said you're gonna defend all these peoples' lives. It's time to end this. Are you ready? Yes, sir! [ shouting ] Let's do it! We're ready! Archie, if they kill me, you know what to do. I gotcha. The only thing stopping a man from greatness is the fear of his own death. I made the call. Did you hear that? You're about to be arrested, sheriff. I guarantee you that, no matter what happens to me, there'll be more white blood than Negro blood running in the streets today. And that includes your blood 'cause you will be dead. That's the only thing you understand, isn't it? Aim! Goddamn it! I am gonna send you to your maker! Goddamn it, Chase! Put your gun down! I am not afraid and I am no less of a man than you are. Put the gun down, Chase! I will not. I said put the goddamned gun down! Go to hell, Neely. I'm ordering you to put that gun down. It's over. Under federal mandate, these people have the right to assemble and I have the obligation to guarantee their safety. You are under arrest. Traitor! You Judas! You're a disgrace to your white race! Cuff him and take him away. Don't think this is over yet, Marcus. You know why men wear hoods? 'Cause they got no courage. You all put down your weapons or you'll be arrested for violating a federal law! And I mean it! We will arrest anybody who does not move out. Move out! Guns down! Let's go. [ laughter ] Yeah! Deacons for Defense! Deacons for Defense! Deacons for Defense! Deacons for Defense! Never again! Never again! Never again! Never again! I hope they drive him straight to hell. You see that coward driving away in that car? He's goin' to jail. You're partly responsible for that. I want you to remember. I don't want you ever to forget it. Deacons for Defense! Deacons for Defense! All right, fellows! Gonna be interesting to see what happens with this integration thing. Your order will be ready tomorrow. See you then. May I help you? No, thank you. I'll call you if I need you. Okay. What do you think? It's nice. So your summer vacation's over? You sure you don't wanna come over to my house? Have some dinner like we talked about in church? I can't. There's still a couple of rednecks down the road who haven't had a chance to whup my ass yet. A lot of people could have died. I'll never subscribe to what you do. You know, I killed white men in Germany. People said they was evil, so that was all right. Now I defend myself against pretty much the same kind of man and you want me to feel like I'm not as honorable as you, that I should feel ashamed for protecting my family. No. No, that's not true. I don't want you to feel ashamed of a damn thing. Truth is, only reason anyone listens to us at all is 'cause they're too afraid to deal with you. Thought I was gonna have to give a gun to my son and tell him to go on and make your way in the world. That's not what I want for him. You might have made it so he doesn't have to. Been a long, long fight. I'm with you. I know that. You take real good care of yourself. Archie, take care of him. I will. Hillibrand. Goodbye, Marcus. Let me hear it! Yes, sir! Never again! Never again! 'Til peace comes at last. 'Til peace comes at last. Deacons for Defense! Deacons for Defense! Deacons for Defense! [ chanting continues ]
